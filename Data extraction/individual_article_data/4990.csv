0,Introduction,"It is urgent to develop alternatives to fossil fuels. Sunlight is a renewable, environment-friendly energy source and hydrogen is one of the most promising solar fuels [1]. Three photocatalytic reactions can produce hydrogen: photocatalytic water splitting [2], photocatalytic dehydrogenation and photocatalytic reforming. The second and the third processes may use biomass-derived alcohols such as methanol or ethanol [3–12]. The reference photocatalytic material, TiO2 semiconductor, must be supplemented by a co-catalyst to increase the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (PHER) efficiency. The role of the co-catalyst, which can be a metal [13,14] or a semiconductor [15], is to enhance the charge career separation through the collection of photoelectrons, and thereby avoid electron-hole recombination [13,16,17]. Although noble metals such as Au and Pd -or combinations- have also proven to be efficient [5,6,13,18–20], Pt/TiO2, with a Pt loading as low as 0.2 wt%, is the most popular system [7,9,16,21]. As metal particle size influences the number and type of active sites, but also the overall electronic structure in the case of small particles (clusters of size < 2 nm) due to quantum size confinement, Pt nanoparticle size is expected to influence the Pt/TiO2 activity. For example, a Pt cluster size effect in PHER was evidenced in combination with CdS and a triethanolamine/water mixture by Schweinberger et al., with a maximum activity for Pt46 clusters [22]. This effect was attributed to the size-dependent electronic properties of the metal clusters with respect to the band edges of the semiconductor. From theoretical calculations, Wang et al. predicted 1 nm to be the optimum size for titania-supported Pt particles in PHER, as it fits the requirements for both electron transfer and H-H coupling [23]. In contrast to these findings, from investigations of Pt/TiO2 catalysts exhibiting single Pt cations, two groups recently concluded that these atomically dispersed species are more active than metallic Pt nanoparticles for PHER from methanol aqueous solution [24–26]. In this paper, we investigate the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol in water over a variety of Pt/TiO2 systems. Two commercial and three homemade shape-controlled titania supports as well as various Pt impregnation post-treatments and two Pt loadings have been employed in combination with thorough pre- and post-reaction analysis of the samples by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in an image-aberration-corrected microscope. Moreover, we have compared the photocatalytic performances between gas-phase and liquid-phase conditions. Our results suggest that Pt particle size is a key parameter driving PHER, and that nanosized metallic clusters are more active and much more stable under the reaction conditions than single Pt cations."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and catalyst preparation,"2.1 Materials and catalyst preparation Shape-controlled TiO2 samples (nanotubes, nanowires and nanobelts) were prepared following literature methods [27,28]. Figure S1 shows Scanning Electron Microscopy images of the samples. In addition, two commercial TiO2 materials (Evonik Aeroxide, purity > 99.5%) were used in this study, P25 and P90. Table 1 reports the main characteristics of all the considered titania supports. Pt/TiO2 samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor (Sigma-Aldrich, >50%), followed by drying at 60 °C for 4 h and calcination (synthetic air) and/or reduction (pure H2) treatment (gas flow 30 mL/min, standard temperature 300 °C, heating rate 2 °C/min, plateau 2 h). Pt loadings were measured by inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES Activa from Horiba Jobin Yvon) after the samples were pre-reduced at 450 °C in H2 flow and dissolved in an acid mixture at 300 °C. The actual Pt loadings corresponding to 0.2 wt% Pt and 1.0 wt% Pt target loadings were 0.15 ± 0.04 wt% and 0.78 ± 0.22 wt%, respectively (see Table 2 in Section 3.1)."
3,Scanning transmission electron microscopy,"2.2 Scanning transmission electron microscopy The annular-dark-field STEM experiments (ADF-STEM) were performed with a FEI Titan ETEM G2 electron microscope equipped with a Cs image aberration corrector and operated at 300 keV. The extraction voltage, camera length, acceptance angles, STEM resolution and probe current were 4500 V, 245 mm, 29.2–146°, 0.14 nm and <0.1nA, respectively. For sample preparation, the powder was crushed and sonicated in ethanol, dropped onto a TEM grid, and dried by a lamp. To avoid contamination during analysis and remove all residual carbon, the samples were Ar plasma-cleaned for 20 s (Plasma Prep 5, GaLa Instrumente). A simple-tilt FEI sample holder and holey carbon-coated 200 mesh Cu grids were used for high-vacuum analyses at RT. No filtering was applied on the STEM images. Particle size histograms were obtained from the analysis of several images with the help of ImageJ software. The average particle diameter was calculated from the mean diameter frequency distribution with the formula: d = Σnidi /Σni , where ni is the number of particles with particle diameter di in a certain range. The diameter is that of the disk having the same area as the projected STEM image of the object. The reported error on particle size corresponds to standard deviation."
4,Photocatalytic ethanol dehydrogenation,"2.3 Photocatalytic ethanol dehydrogenation 2.3.1 Photocatalytic tests in the gas phase The photocatalytic tests were performed at RT and atmospheric pressure in a tubular glass photoreactor [29,30]. An argon stream (20 mL/min) was bubbled into a Dreschel bottle containing a liquid mixture of ethanol and water to obtain a gaseous reactant mixture of EtOH:H2O = 1:9 (molar basis), which was directly introduced in the reactor. The UV-light source (from SACOPA, S.A.U.) consisted of four LEDs at 365 ± 5 nm (diameter 18 mm, total power 760 W/m2) and a synthetic quartz glass cylindrical lens that transmits the light to the photocatalyst. A circular cellulose membrane (Albet, pore size 35–40 µm, density 80 g/m2, thickness 180 µm) was impregnated in its central part (disk of 18 mm in diameter) with 1.8 ± 0.2 mg of grinded catalyst dispersed in ethanol through ultrasonication. The membrane was then placed between the glass tubes of the photoreactor, with the side that contains the photocatalyst facing towards the UV-light source. The reactor tubes and the impregnated membrane were sealed using an O-ring, parafilm and a clamp. The photoreactor was connected to a GC (micro gas chromatograph Agilent 490) equipped with MS 5 Å, Plot U and Stabilwax columns for a complete analysis of the photoreaction products, which were monitored on-line every 4 min. Before the photocatalytic tests, the system was purged with argon for one hour, and the absence of oxygen was checked by GC. 2.3.2 Photocatalytic tests in the liquid phase The photocatalytic tests were performed in a double-wall semi-batch slurry reactor with 600 rpm stirring. Its temperature was regulated to 20 °C through thermostated water recirculation in the double-wall. The reactor was filled with 50 mg of catalyst dispersed in 50 mL of a mixture of ethanol and distilled water (50:50 vol%). Before irradiation, the system was purged with an argon flow for 30 min. The gases were analyzed by micro GC with thermal conductivity detectors (Agilent 300A equipped with Molecular Sieve 5 Å, PLOT U, OV-1 and Alumina columns). A 125 W high-pressure mercury polychromatic lamp was used to illuminate the reactor through a 20 cm2 surface area. The incident photon intensity likely to be absorbed by the photocatalyst was measured with a radiatometer device composed of a spectrometer (Avantes, AvaSpec-2018) coupled with a fiber optic probe (Avantes, FCR-7UV-400–2-ME) and a cosine corrector. In both gas- and liquid-phase conditions, only H2 and acetaldehyde were produced. No CO2, CO or other secondary products were formed, meaning that the only observed reaction was primary ethanol dehydrogenation: (1) C2H5OH → C2H4O + H2 The photonic yield writes as follows [31]: PY = r H 2 Φ phot where rH2 is the dihydrogen formation rate and Φ phot is the absorbable photon flux. In order to facilitate comparison of measured PY with the literature, we also refer to the apparent quantum yield, which writes as [16,32]: AQY = 2 r H 2 Φ phot tot In gas-phase conditions, Φ phot = Φ phot tot = 2120 µmol/h (diode power 760 W/m2, Sopt = 2.54 cm2, λ = 365 nm). In liquid-phase conditions, the UV lamp is polychromatic with a total photon flux of Φ phot tot = 6600 µmol/h (power 220 W/m2, Sopt ≈ 20 cm2). The TiO2 samples absorbing only in the 290 – 410 nm range (see irradiance spectrum, Fig. S0), the flux of absorbable photons is Φ phot = 1500 µmol/h. Note that in the case of polychromatic irradiation (as in the liquid-phase conditions used here), PY and AQY should be called “photonic efficiency” and “apparent quantum efficiency”, respectively [31,33]. However, for the sake of simplicity, only PY and AQY terms are used herein. For gas-phase conditions, the experimental error on H2 formation rate was evaluated to 10% in standard deviation by testing 4 samples from the same batch (0.2 wt% Pt/TiO2-P90 pre-reduced at 300 °C). For liquid-phase conditions, it was estimated to 12%."
5,Results,
6,Structural characterization,"3.1 Structural characterization A series of 13 samples, listed in Table 2 , was investigated, as well as bare TiO2-P90 and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2/P90 impregnates (without thermal treatment). The samples are named according to the target loading in wt%Pt, the TiO2 type, the thermal treatment type, and the maximum temperature in °C. For example, 0.2Pt/P90 C300R300 denotes a catalyst supported on P90, loaded with 0.2 wt% Pt, calcined in air at up to 300 °C, and finally reduced in H2 at up to 300 °C. The TiO2 types were commercial P25 and P90, and shape-controlled nanotubes (NT), nanowires (NW) and nanobelts (NB), the main characteristics of which are reported in Table 1. While calcination was always performed at 300 °C, reduction was carried out between 200 °C and 600 °C. The minimal temperatures of thermal treatments were chosen on the basis of thermal analysis results, which show that weight loss, heat release and water desorption occur below ca. 300 °C for calcination and below ca. 200 °C for reduction (Fig. S2). Fig. 1 shows STEM images of the samples, together with the corresponding size histograms. The calcination treatment leads to ca. 100% Pt dispersion (i.e., all the Pt atoms are exposed to the surface), with mostly single atoms for 0.2Pt C300 and a mixture of single atoms and small clusters (0.65 ± 0.30 nm) for 1Pt C300. The reduction and calcination-reduction treatments lead to a majority of Pt clusters. For shape-controlled 0.2Pt/TiO2 R300, the average Pt cluster size is 1.4–1.7 nm, while it is 1.2 nm for 0.2Pt/P25 and 0.9–1.0 nm for 0.2Pt/P90 samples reduced at up to 400 °C. 1 For 0.2Pt/P90 R300, the size is calculated to be 1.3 ± 0.3 nm, but from 51 particles only (Fig. S9). 1 For the commercial catalysts, the slight decrease in Pt dispersion can be ascribed to the decrease in TiO2 surface area from P90 (114 m2/g) to P25 (50 m2/g). However, this does not hold for shape-controlled anatase titania samples, which exhibit either surface areas superior or equal to 250 m2/g (nanotubes and nanowires) or small surface area (nanobelts, 35 m2/g). In those cases, the Pt particle size might also be controlled by the titania texture and surface structure. In particular, nanotubes and nanobelts expose predominantly {1 0 0} facets whereas nanowires expose {0 0 1} facets [28]. For the P90 support, the Pt loading and the reduction temperature were increased to 1 wt% and 450–600 °C, respectively, in order to increase the Pt particle size. As a result, the 1Pt/P90 R450 and 1Pt/P90 R600 samples display average sizes of 1.3 nm and 1.6 nm, respectively. In situ X-ray diffraction performed under H2 flow on a 1 wt% Pt/P90 sample prepared by IWI and direct reduction at 200 °C shows that the titania crystallites start to grow and anatase starts to convert into rutile above 500 °C (Fig. S3). This leads to a loss of surface area, the catalyst treated at 600 °C having a BET surface area of 43 m2/g. Besides, high-magnification STEM images (Fig. S4) do not reveal the occurrence of strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), i.e. diffusion of titanium oxide over the Pt particles upon reducing thermal treatment at high temperature [34]."
7,Gas-phase dehydrogenation of ethanol,"3.2 Gas-phase dehydrogenation of ethanol First, experimental conditions were screened with a given photocatalyst, 0.2Pt/P90 R300. Fig. S5 reports the rate of hydrogen production for various catalyst weights and ethanol concentrations in water. Fig. S5a shows that the H2 production rate is roughly constant between 10% and 100% ethanol in the gas phase. Similarly, a previous kinetic study of PHER from water-ethanol mixtures on Au/TiO2 catalysts has shown that the reaction is near-zero order in ethanol for high ethanol concentrations. This behavior could be well described with a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism [35]. Fig. S5b shows that the rate increases with the mass of catalyst, and starts to reach a plateau above ca. 2.5 mg, which is due to photon transfer limitations [33,36]. This led us to choose 10% ethanol concentration and 1.8 ± 0.2 mg catalyst weight as standard parameters. Fig. 2 reports the rate of H2 production vs. time for Pt/TiO2 catalysts with (a) several TiO2 types (0.2 wt% Pt, R300) and (b) various thermal treatments (P90, 0.2 or 1 wt% Pt). Fig. S6 reports the full dataset, which includes the results for 0.2Pt/P90 C300, C300R300, and R300C300. In addition, a 20 h-long test is shown in Fig. S7 for the 0.2Pt/P90 R300 catalyst. In terms of catalytic stability, for the pre-reduced samples, the rate reaches a maximum within 10 min and then stabilizes or slowly decreases. The catalyst treated at the lowest temperature, 0.2Pt/P90 R200, is the one that deactivates most. A different behavior is displayed by the two C300 catalysts, whose rates show an initial induction period (up to 1 h) before stabilization. Thus, low-temperature reduction and/or calcination seem to generate Pt species relatively unstable under the reaction conditions. From Fig. 2a, the activity order between the TiO2 samples is: NB < NT < NW < P25 < P90. Notably, P90 provides a higher activity than the widely used P25. This trend might relate to the differences in the TiO2 polymorph phase (s), the specific surface area and/or the Pt cluster size, and these parameters may influence each other. According to Fig. 2b, the pre-calcined catalyst is nearly twice less active than the pre-reduced catalysts (0.2Pt/P90 R200-R400). The highest activities are obtained after reduction in H2 below 450 °C. For example, in the case of 0.2Pt/P90 R300, the Pt co-catalyst amplification factor with respect to bare TiO2 reaches 750, which is much higher than previously reported [10,11,21]. Fig. S6 shows that, for the 0.2–1 wt% range, the Pt loading has no significant effect on the photocatalytic performance for Pt/P90 C300. This result is consistent with that of Xing et al. for Pt supported on anatase or P25 TiO2 for photocatalytic methanol dehydrogenation. The authors found an increase of the activity with the Pt loading up to 0.2 wt%, followed by a plateau between 0.2 wt% and 1 wt% [37]. For a higher surface-area mesoporous TiO2 (209 m2/g against 50 m2/g for P25), Kandiel et al. even evidenced an activity optimum for 0.2 wt% Pt [7]. Alternatively, the above result may be due to the existence of an optimal Pt loading comprised between 0.2 wt% and 1 wt%, as found by Li et al. for the same reaction on nanostructured catalysts [21]. Another interesting result (Fig. S6) is that the 0.2Pt/P90 R300C300 has a similar activity as its R300 and C300R300 counterparts, which implies that, for comparable average Pt particles sizes, the initial oxidation state of Pt has little influence on the catalytic activity. Indeed, as compared to reduction, air calcination obviously increases Pt oxidation, but under reaction conditions the same steady active state of Pt appears to be formed for pre-reduced and pre-calcined samples. Plotting the photonic yield of H2 production after 1 h on stream as a function of the Pt cluster size for all the reduced samples suggests an inverse correlation between the photonic yield and the size (Fig. 3 ). Note that Pt particle size, especially in the range below 2 nm, influences the amount, the geometry, and the electronic structure of surface Pt active sites. As the Pt loading has little effect on the photocatalytic activity, this behavior cannot be ascribed to an influence of the number of available surface Pt sites, and instead points to an intrinsic size effect. The support and the treatment temperature would thus play an indirect role in tuning the Pt cluster size. These results corroborate the recent theoretical investigation by Wang et al. predicting that a Pt particle size of 1 nm, corresponding to quasi-bilayer clusters, would be the best compromise between the efficiency of the photoelectron transfer from TiO2 to Pt (more favorable at smaller sizes) and that of the H-H coupling at the Pt surface (more favorable at larger sizes) [23]. Moreover, our hypothesis on size effect is supported by the results of Li et al., who have shown that the crystal facets of TiO2 do not play a critical role in PHER [17]. However, the Pt/TiO2 activity might also be influenced by parameters such as the TiO2 phase and surface area, and the Pt particle shape and surface density. In addition, since a reducing treatment at 600 °C initiates TiO2 modification (Fig. S3) and may also induce SMSI effect (although not evidenced in Fig. S4), the data point for Pt/P90 R600 in Fig. 3 should be considered with caution. While Pt/NB is by far the least active catalyst, Pt/P90 R200 is initially the most active. However, this sample is also the most prone to deactivation (Fig. 2). This may originate from the initially incomplete Pt precursor decomposition, although thermal analysis shows that most features are present below 200 °C (Fig. S2). This led us to test the activity of as-impregnated Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2/TiO2-P90 (“fresh”) samples. Fig. S8 shows that these samples (0.2 wt% and 1 wt% Pt loadings) slowly reach activities similar to that of the 0.2Pt/P90 R300 catalyst. This suggests an autocatalytic process, in which formed H2 gradually reduces the impregnate. The maximum activities are reached in 26 min and ca. 40 min for 0.2 wt% and 1 wt% Pt loadings, respectively. The activity of the 0.2Pt/P90 fresh sample then slowly decreases (similarly to 0.2Pt/P90 R200), whereas the activity of the 1Pt/P90 fresh sample stabilizes. This difference in behavior recalls that of the two Pt/P90 C300 catalysts (Fig. S6) and may correspond to a two-step process, with Pt reduction followed by agglomeration. The latter likely depends on the Pt loading via the Pt particle surface density. To explain the differences in time evolution of the H2 production rates, selected catalysts were analyzed by STEM after the photocatalytic tests. Fig. S9 shows representative STEM images and Fig. 4 displays the evolution of selected Pt particle size histograms from pre- to post-reaction state. The catalysts supported on commercial TiO2 (P90 and P25) and pre-reduced (R300) exhibit little change: while in the P90 case the size distribution is almost unaffected, for P25 it shows a positive shift of 0.3 nm. The increase is stronger for 0.2Pt/NT R300, with a positive shift of the average size by 1.0 nm and a broadening of the size distribution by 0.4 nm. Finally, the 1Pt/P90 C300 catalyst, which initially contained a large fraction of single atoms coexisting with subnanometric clusters, is deeply affected by the reaction medium, which mostly generates 2–3 nm-sized nanoparticles. Sintering of Pt species was also observed for 0.2Pt/P90 C300 (Fig. S9). The instability of these pre-oxidized catalysts can be ascribed to photoreduction as well as to the reducing effect of hydrogen, which is known to destabilize metal cations initially anchored on oxides [38–43]. The 0.2Pt/P90 and 1Pt/90 fresh impregnates were also analyzed by STEM after the photocatalytic tests. They exhibited nanoparticles of 2.1 ± 0.4 nm and 1.4 ± 0.4 nm in size, respectively, confirming the in situ decomposition of the Pt precursor and the subsequent aggregation of Pt atoms. The larger particle size at lower loading, although counterintuitive, is consistent with the lower activity of the 0.2Pt sample with respect to the 1Pt sample (Fig. S8), when one takes into account the size-activity relationship displayed in Fig. 3. Indeed, in spite of the sintering of most catalysts on stream, the inverse correlation between the photonic yield and the Pt particle size is still valid when one considers the post-reaction size, as shown in Fig. S10."
8,Liquid-phase photocatalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol,"3.3 Liquid-phase photocatalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol In order to confirm the generality of the above results, a selection of the P90-supported catalysts was tested for the same reaction, but in liquid-phase conditions. In this case, the experimental conditions were not screened, but were chosen not to limit the kinetics by the amount of catalyst or ethanol, accordingly to literature works [6,9,13,44]. Fig. 5 displays the hydrogen production rate as a function of time. Several observations can be made. For a given Pt loading (0.2 wt%), the activity order is C300 < C300R300 < R300, which is in line with the gas-phase results. More surprising is the effect of the Pt loading, which negatively affects the activity of the C300 catalyst, whereas it has little effect under gas-phase conditions (Fig. 2 and Fig. S6). As pointed out by Li et al., this can be attributed to excessive Pt on TiO2, which increases the opacity and light scattering of the suspension, thereby reducing the photon absorption of TiO2. Moreover, Pt at high concentration may act as a charge recombination center, resulting in the decreased activity [21]. The threshold loadings above which these phenomena occur may be different in gaseous and liquid-phase conditions. Similarly to the gas-phase conditions under which the pre-calcined catalyst activities slowly evolved, in the liquid phase these catalysts show an activation over the whole testing period. This is most likely due to the reduction/aggregation phenomenon previously evoked for the gas phase. Another striking similarity between the two conditions lies in the behavior of the 0.2Pt/P90 and 1Pt/P90 fresh impregnates (see Fig. S11 for liquid phase versus Fig. S8 for gas phase). In both cases, the activities reach their maximum after an induction period, but only 0.2Pt gradually deactivates after reaching its maximum activity, and this activity is lower than that of 1Pt. STEM measurements after the photocatalytic tests show that the Pt particle size in reduced samples is essentially unchanged, whereas again the pre-calcined samples are deeply affected: starting from atomically dispersed Pt, the average Pt particle sizes after the reaction are 2.1 ± 0.4 nm and 2.4 ± 0.6 nm for 0.2Pt/P90 C300 and 1Pt/P90 C300, respectively (Fig. S12). The “fresh” impregnates contain, after the tests, a mixture of Pt species ranging from single Pt atoms to large aggregates (size 2.8 ± 1.1 nm for 0.2Pt/P90 fresh and 11 ± 4 nm for 1Pt/P90 fresh). Therefore, similarly to gas-phase conditions, in the liquid phase only the reduced catalysts are structurally stable."
9,Discussion,"3.4 Discussion Fig. 6 reports the photonic yield in liquid phase versus that in gas phase. The 0.2Pt/P90 C300 catalyst, i.e. the sample initially composed mainly of single Pt atoms, seems to be favored by liquid-phase conditions. Besides, under our conditions, the co-catalytic effect of Pt with respect to bare TiO2 is lower in the liquid phase: the maximum ratio between the photonic yields for Pt/TiO2 and TiO2 is of 130, versus 960 for 0.2Pt/P90 R200 in the gas phase. Table 3 summarizes the performances of the 0.2Pt/P90 R300 catalyst in liquid and gaseous phases. The H2 production rates are of the order or superior to the values reported so far for Pt/TiO2 catalysts [10,13,16,21,24–26,37,44–46]. Nevertheless, such comparisons should be taken with caution as the experimental conditions (nature of the alcohol, gas or liquid phase, presence of photon-transfer and/or mass-transfer limitations, UV irradiation power, etc.) can have dramatic effects on the photocatalytic activity. Note, however, that the activities of Pt/TiO2 for PHER from methanol and ethanol aqueous solutions were previously found to be similar [13,19]."
10,Conclusions,"The focus of this work was on the relationship between the platinum initial state, the Pt cluster size and the resulting PHER activity of the Pt/TiO2 system. In order to disentangle the effects under investigation from the influence of TiO2 properties, we studied catalysts supported on several titania types. A series of Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 onto commercial or homemade shape-controlled titania followed by calcination and/or reduction thermal treatments. While calcination-reduction or direct reduction generates Pt clusters of 10–20 Å in size, air calcination leads to atomically dispersed Pt. For the catalysts pre-reduced in H2, independently of the TiO2 material, the steady-state gas-phase PHER rate from water-ethanol mixture shows a possible reverse relationship with the Pt cluster size. In particular, the higher surface area of TiO2-P90 with respect to TiO2-P25 leads to higher Pt dispersion, which would explain the superior activity in the P90 case. For Pt clusters supported on this form of titania, the Pt loading (0.2 or 1 wt%) and the initial treatment (oxidizing vs. reducing) have little influence on the catalytic activity. However, the atomically dispersed catalysts exhibit ca. twice less PHER activity than their pre-reduced counterparts. From post-reaction STEM, it appears that the former undergo extensive sintering on stream, whereas cluster catalysts are structurally more stable. Complementary photocatalytic tests in liquid-phase conditions confirm the superiority of catalysts containing Pt nanoclusters over atomically dispersed Pt. However, pre-calcined low-loaded Pt/TiO2-P90, initially containing mostly single Pt atoms, seems favored by liquid-phase conditions. The best performances in both liquid and gas media are obtained with 1 nm-sized Pt clusters supported on TiO2-P90 (0.2Pt/P90 R300), with H2 production rates of 170 mmol h−1 gcat −1 (gas) and 6 mmol h−1 gcat −1 (liquid)."
