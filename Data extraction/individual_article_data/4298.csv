0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) has been expected as a clean and versatile fuel to replace the fossil fuels in the future energy transition due to its environmental-friendly and high gravimetric energy density (approximately 142 MJ kg−1) [1,2]. Compared with traditional steam methane reforming and coal gasification, the electrolytic production of H2 from water involving cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is regarded as a more promising hydrogen generation technique with advantages of large-scale application potential, zero carbon emission and high product purity [3–5]. However, owing to the sluggish OER kinetics and the lack of economical proton exchange membranes in acidic media, alkaline electrochemical water splitting, the key step in chlor-alkali and water-alkali process, will dominate in future water electrolysis. Proverbially, alkaline HER requires extra water adsorption and dissociation process (the Volmer step: H2O + e− + * → H* + OH−, where * represents a surface adsorption site and H* corresponds to the hydrogen intermediate), which leads to the activity two or three order of magnitude lower than that in acidic media [6,7]. Even for the state-of-the-art platinum (Pt) catalysts, the performance is still far from their acid-operating counterpart. Accordingly, the development of advanced alkaline HER electrocatalysts is highly desirable for future energy conversion systems. Up to now, non-noble metal materials such as transition metal carbides [8], nitrides [9], phosphides [10] and chalcogenides [11] have been widely explored as efficient alkaline HER electrocatalysts, and even have displayed impressive bifunctional HER/OER performance for overall water splitting. However, their catalytic activities still have a non-ignorable gap in comparison with noble metal materials [12]. Encouragingly, implanting a small amount of cost-competitive noble metal into initial catalysts has been considered a promising strategy, which not only can enhance the catalytic performance without incurring excessive cost, but also significantly regulate the local electronic structure of hybrid materials [13,14]. Among many candidates, ruthenium (Ru) as the cheapest platinum-group metal with a price of only about 1/25 of Pt, which has a similar bond strength of adsorbed hydrogen (65 Kcal mol−1) relative to Pt (62 Kcal mol−1), is regarded as an ideal low-content additives to improve the HER performance [15,16]. According to previous publications, Ru can exist in the form of nanoparticle or cluster [17,18], single-atom [19], Ru-based alloy [20], Ru-based compound [21] and heterogeneous doping [22]. As a typical example, Sun et al., [23] recently established a single-atom strategy to construct an excellent MOFs-based HER electrocatalyst (NiRu0.13-BDC) by introducing atomically dispersed Ru in Ni-BDC. Benefiting from the electronic structure modulation of Ni center by Ru single-atom, the binding strength of H2O and H* had been well-optimized, and thus enhancing the HER performance. Furthermore, the construction of multi-components heterostructure has also been widely studied in catalysts design [24–26]. Generally, catalysts with a heterostructure possess abundant epitaxial heterogeneity at the atomic level, which enables efficient electronic transmission and interaction [27]. The strong heterogeneous electronic interaction around heterointerface can allow an potent regulation of the electronic state in hybrid materials, which not only can inherit respective advantages but also generate emerging effects [28]. Transition metal oxides (TMOs) as a kind of materials with flexible composition and tunable filling of d-orbitals [25], have recently been recognized as the excellent candidate for constructing multi-interface heterostructure electrocatalysts. For instance, Zhang et al., [29] reported a TMOs-based heterostructure assembling on Ni foam (RuO2-NiO/NF) by a dipping and annealing method. The as-prepared RuO2-NiO/NF exhibited a remarkable bifunctional HER/OER catalytic activity owing to the electronic state regulation from the RuO2-NiO heterointerface. Obviously, much effort has been devoted to regulating the electronic structure of electrocatalysts through a single effect (such as introducing heteroatoms or forming heterointerfaces). However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been few reports focused on the collective electronic modulation by integrating Ru-doping and TMO-based heterostructure. Moreover, how to control the amount of Ru-doping into hybrid materials and verify the synergistic effects between heteroatoms and heterostructure in local electronic structure modulation are still a great challenge. In addition, the well-designed morphology can ensure the electrode material exposing more active sites and enhancing the charge or mass transfer efficiency [30,31]. The morphology engineering, therefore, is another important aspect for optimal design of catalysts. As a family of porous crystalline materials coordinated by metal ions or cluster and organic linkers, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), especially zeolite-based imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) have recently emerged as the promising morphology-oriented precursors to prepare various metal–carbon based materials via controllable thermal annealing process [32–38]. For example, Mukhiya et al., [39] recently fabricated a ZIF-derived Co NP-entrapped long N-CNTs in porous graphitic carbon nanofibers (Co/N-CNT@PCNF) by a simple thermal method. Due to incorporating the merits of ZIF-67 and efficient electrospinning, the as-synthesized material exhibited outstanding performance as a supercapacitor electrode and a bifunctional electrocatalyst for HER and OER. Through tailored design of annealing conditions (e.g., annealing temperature and time, etc.), the derivative materials are expected to effectively inherit the advantageous morphology of corresponding MOF precursor, such as zero-dimensional (0D) nanospheres, one-dimensional (1D) nanorods, and two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets [40]. Impressively, they can also feature with many new superiorities including enhanced conductivity, well-dispersed catalytic sites and well-protected inner active species [41]. Unfortunately, most of MOF-derived materials are now limited in powdery (operationally only under small current density, usually ≤ 100 mA cm−2) and exhibit poor durability under severe conditions, heavily limiting its large-scale use [42]. As we all know, Ni foam is a popular self-supported conductive support with three-dimensional (3D) open macropore channels and excellent mechanical strength [43]. Thus, we can reasonably speculate that MOF-derived materials grown on Ni foam to construct a self-supported electrode will significantly improves the structural robustness and working current with no need of polymer binder like polytetrafluoroethylene or Nafion [44]. However, the high-temperature (usually > 600 ℃) pyrolysis usually adopted during the preparation that tend to destroy the flexibility and mechanical strength of Ni foam skeleton, making this problem remain a great vagueness. Herein, we report a MOF-derived Ru doped cobalt–nickel oxide heterostructure nanosheet arrays grown in situ on Ni foam (abbreviated as Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF hereinafter), and then it is directly used as the efficient alkaline HER self-supported electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the precisely controllable low-temperature (450 ℃) thermal annealing process, the resulted Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF can effectively inherit the advantageous 2D nanosheet morphology from Co-MOF precursor and simultaneously maintain the mechanical robustness of 3D Ni foam skeleton, which are essential for exposing more active sites and accelerating the charge or mass transfer. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) combined with high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) corresponding elemental mapping verify that Ru is successfully incorporated into the lattice of Co3O4 and NiO. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicate that Ru-doping and Co3O4-NiO heterointerface can collectively regulate the electronic state of Ni and Co sites, thus optimizing the H2O adsorption/desorption and proton adsorption in alkaline HER process. As a result, the optimized Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF exhibits a superior HER catalytic activity in 1 M KOH, which can reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 at overpotential of 44 mV and 115 mV, respectively. Moreover, the obtained self-supported electrode material can remain stable for over 60 h at 100 mA cm−2 with ignorable decay. Foreseeably, this work presents a promising strategy for developing economical and efficient MOF-derived alkaline HER self-supported electrocatalysts for future energy applications."
1,Material and methods,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials All the chemical reagents were used without any further purification. Ni foam was purchased from Guangzhou Huayu Trading Co., Ltd. with the thickness of 1 mm. Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIm) and Nafion (5 wt%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ammonium fluoride (NH4F), urea ((NH2)2CO), potassium hydroxide (KOH), Pt-C catalyst (20% Pt) and ruthenium chloride trihydrate (RuCl3·3H2O) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Industrial Co., Ltd. The deionized water (18.2 MΩ) and ethanol (95%) were employed as solvent throughout the whole experiments."
3,Preparation of Co-MOF-NF,"2.2 Preparation of Co-MOF-NF The Co-MOF-NF was prepared via a simple wet-chemical method under room temperature. Before the experiment, the commercial Ni foam (2 × 3 cm2) was firstly washed with acetone, 2 M HCl aqueous solution, ethanol and deionized water under sonication treatment for each 20 min to remove the oxides and dirt on the surface. Next, the precursor solution were prepared by dissolving 2-MeIm (16 mmol) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (2 mmol) in 40 mL deionized water, respectively. When the solute were completely dissolved, the Co(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous solution was quickly poured into the 2-MeIm aqueous solution under stirring. After mixing for several seconds, a piece of pre-treated Ni foam was immersed into the mixture solution and reacted for 4 h under room temperature. Then the purple Co-MOF-NF was taken out and washed with ethanol carefully, followed drying under vacuum at 60 °C overnight for further use."
4,Preparation of Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF and Co3O4-NiO-NF,"2.3 Preparation of Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF and Co3O4-NiO-NF The Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF was synthesized by a two-step process under room temperature. In detail, a piece of pre-treated Co-MOF-NF was firstly immersed in 30 mL ethanol solution containing 50 mg RuCl3·3H2O. After reacting for 15 min, the sample was taken out and washed with ethanol carefully, followed drying under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. Then, the precursor prepared above was transferred to a horizontal quartz tube and annealed at 450 °C for 2 h with a heating ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 in Ar atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, the Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF was finally obtained and washed with ethanol carefully, followed drying under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. The preparation process of Co3O4-NiO-NF without Ru doping was the same as Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF except for immersing in RuCl3·3H2O ethanol solution."
5,Preparation of Co3O4-NF and NiO-NF,"2.4 Preparation of Co3O4-NF and NiO-NF The preparation of Co3O4-NF and NiO-NF were prepared with reference to previous literature reports with some slight modifications [25]. Specifically, 1 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (or Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), 2 mmol NH4F and 5 mmol (NH2)2CO were firstly dissolved in 35 mL of deionized water under stirring to obtain the transparent solution. Then the above solution together with a piece of pre-treated Ni foam (2 × 3 cm2) were transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave for hydrothermal reaction at 120 °C for 6 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was washed with ethanol and followed drying under vacuum at 60 °C overnight (hereafter denoted as pre-Co3O4-NF or pre-NiO-NF). Next, the pre-Co3O4-NF and pre-NiO-NF were put into a muffle furnace and annealed at 400 °C for 1 h in air with a heating ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 to obtain the Co3O4-NF and NiO-NF."
6,Preparation of Pt-C-NF,"2.5 Preparation of Pt-C-NF To prepare Pt-C-NF, 5 mg Pt-C (20% Pt) catalyst and 80 μL Nafion (5 wt%) solution were dispersed in 920 μL of isopropyl alcohol by sonication for 30 mins. Then the catalyst ink was drop-cast onto the pre-treated Ni foam, where the total effective loading surface area of noble-metal catalysts was about 1.5 cm2, and the mass loading was the same as Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF (specific values of samples were given in Table S2)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Material characterization,"3.1 Material characterization The Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF was synthesized by a simple and scalable preparation route as described in Fig. 1 . Briefly, 2D Co-MOF nanosheet arrays were firstly deposited on Ni foam (Co-MOF-NF) via a wet chemical method under room temperature. Then, the obtained Co-MOF-NF was immersed in RuCl3·3H2O ethanol solution and followed with a low-temperature thermal annealing process to acquire the target Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF. During the annealing process, the pre-treated bare Ni foam (Fig. S1) can not only act as conductive substrate to support the active species, but also serve as Ni source for preparing Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF in that Ru has a higher redox potential than Ni (ΔE = E Ru(+3)/(0) - E Ni(+2)/(0) > 0) [22]. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Co-MOF-NF indicate the uniform coverage of 2D leaf-shaped nanosheet arrays on Ni foam surface with the growth height of about 9–10 μm and single sheet thickness of about 200–300 nm (Fig. 2 a). Moreover, the successful preparation of Co-MOF has been verified by the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. As disclosed in Fig. 2 b, the vibration modes at about 650–1550 cm−1 are linked to imidazole ring, while the stretching vibration peak of Co-N bond appears at a lower wavenumber of about 430 cm−1. These results can also be well supported by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S2) [45–47]. The homogeneous presence of C, N, O and Co elements are revealed by SEM-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) elemental mapping (Fig. S3). Such a 2D Co-MOF nanosheet arrays integrated on 3D macropores Ni foam network is expected to be an ideal morphology-oriented precursor for the followed MOF-derived material owing to its larger surface area and higher accessible active sites in comparison with the traditional 0D MOF nanoparticles [48–50]. As mentioned before, the morphology of MOF-derived material is closely related to the annealing temperature, and high-temperature (>600 ℃) pyrolysis usually cause the skeleton of corresponding MOF precursor to collapse completely and destroy the mechanical strength of Ni foam skeleton. Based on the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in Fig. S4, here the annealing temperature is fixed at 450 ℃, such a low-temperature annealing can ensure the removal of absorbed water on Co-MOF surface and the transformation of organic ligand to derivative carbon matrix [44,51]. Fig. 2 c shows the SEM images of the as-prepared Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF, in which the 2D leaf-shaped nanosheet morphology is also observed similar with the above Co-MOF-NF precursor. The only difference is that the nanosheets surface become rougher and appear slight bended, possibly due to the partial removal of weakly linked MOF ligand. Moreover, Fig. S5 exhibits the well-maintained mechanical strength and skeleton integrity of 3D Ni foam network after the low-temperature thermal annealing process, which can allow accelerating the release of gas-bubbles generated at the three-phase interface in the subsequent electrochemical process (see the underwater gas-bubble contact-angles test in Fig. S6). In detail, the gas-bubble contact angles are measured as 76.8°, 138.3° and 154.5° for bare NF, Co-MOF-NF and Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF, respectively, indicating that Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF is more aerophobic and the generated gas-bubble can be quickly separated from the surface of electrode material [52,53]. For a better comparison, Co3O4-NiO-NF without Ru-doping, single-phase Co3O4-NF and NiO-NF are also synthesized (Fig. S7) [25]. Apart from the two most intense peaks of 44.4° and 51.6° that assignable to Ni foam substrate (JCPDS no. 01–1258) [54], the XRD pattern of Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF displays the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 31.2°, 36.8°, 59.4° and 65.2° that are indexed to the (220), (311), (511) and (440) planes of cube Co3O4 (JCPDS no. 42–1467) [55], while the peaks located at 43.3° and 62.9° are ascribed to the (200) and (220) planes of cube NiO (JCPDS no. 47–1049), respectively (Fig. 2 d) [25]. These observations imply the co-existence of Co3O4 and NiO. In view of Ni foam is the only Ni source, the formation of NiO can be attributed to the oxidation of Ni0 by Ru3+, in which Ni0 are partially oxidized to mixing Ni2+/Ni3+ and further NiO is formed during the followed annealing process. The formation of Co3O4 should be derived from Co-MOF precursor. Particularly, the absence of Ru-based compounds diffraction peaks suggests that Ru may exists in the form of low-content heterogeneous doping [22], which is also supported by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis (Table. S1). Furthermore, the diffraction peaks of Co3O4-NiO-NF are more intense with a sharper shape in comparison with Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF, implying that Ru-doping will reduce the crystallinity of Co3O4-NiO, which presumably caused by some lattice defects because Ru has a larger atomic radius relative to Co and Ni [56]. The TEM image (Fig. S8) depicts that many nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the nanosheet surface. Upon magnifying the edge position of single nanosheet, a thin amorphous carbon layer (approximately 5 nm thickness) wrapped around the nanosheet can be clearly observed (Fig. 2 e), which can effectively protect the internal active sites from being corroded by electrolyte. Moreover, the co-existence of Co3O4 and NiO is further confirmed by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image and corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image (Fig. 2 f and inset). The random oriented lattice phase and regular diffraction rings demonstrated the polycrystalline nature of Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF [57]. It is worth noting that the clear heterointerfaces are highlighted by pink dashed line in Fig. 2 f to separate the regions of Co3O4 and NiO. The corresponding lattice spacing are measured to be 2.47 Å and 2.13 Å, larger than pristine Co3O4 (311) plane (2.44 Å) and NiO (200) plane (2.09 Å), respectively, owing to the incorporation of the larger size Ru atoms [29,55], in keeping with the above XRD results. The high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) elemental mapping results (Fig. 2 g) verify the uniform distribution of Co, Ni and Ru elements, and corresponding elemental ratio are presented in Fig. S9. All the above results suggest that a MOF-derived Ru doped Co3O4-NiO heterostructure with 2D leaf-shaped nanosheet morphology deposited on 3D Ni foam has been successfully fabricated. Furthermore, in order to confirm the high surface area and hierarchical porous properties of MOF-derived self-supported materials, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distributions curves of Co-MOF-NF precursor and Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF are presented in Fig. S10. The typical type-IV isotherms with a pronounced hysteresis loop suggesting the existence of hierarchical pore structure, which is further supported by the pore size distributions curves [35,58]. The specific surface area estimated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method of Co-MOF-NF and Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF are 169.97 m2 g−1 and 236.45 m2 g−1, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are further conducted to investigate the surface element composition and chemical valence states. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the XPS survey pattern verify that the surface of Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF is composed of C, N, O, Co, Ni, and Ru elements, in accordance with the above HAADF-STEM elemental mapping results. The high-resolution N 1 s spectrum (Fig. S11) reveals the existence of pyridinic N (399.0 eV), pyrrolic N (400.5 eV) and graphitic N (401.8 eV), implying that the organic ligand of Co-MOF precursor will be converted into N-doped carbon matrix to support the active species during the thermal annealing process [59]. With regard to the high-resolution Ru 3p spectrum in Fig. 3 b, the peaks located at 462.6 eV and 484.9 eV are assigned to metallic Ru0, owing to the reduction of Ru3+ by Ni foam [22]. The other peaks centered at 464.6 eV and 487.0 eV are assigned to Ru4+, being attributable that metallic Ru0 on the surface are inevitably partially oxidized when exposed to the air [60]. This speculation is also corroborated by the existence of Ru-O bond at 529.4 eV in the high-resolution O 1 s spectrum of Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF (Fig. S12) [21]. Notably, the obvious shifts in binding energies (BEs) can be seen in the high-resolution Co 2p and Ni 2p spectrum. As displayed in Fig. 3 c, the Co 2p spectrum of Co3O4-NiO-NF exhibits two contributions, named Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 (resulting from the spin–orbit splitting), located at 779.9 and 795.0 eV, respectively, along with their satellite peaks at 787.7 and 803.3 eV [61]. The Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 can be further deconvoluted into Co3+, Co2+, which confirms the existence of Co3O4, in keeping with the above XRD and HRTEM results [25,62]. After forming Co3O4-NiO heterointerface, the BEs of Co3O4-NiO-NF are positively shifted by 0.1 eV relative to single-component Co3O4-NF; while further incorporating Ru, the BEs of Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF are negatively shifted by 0.4 eV compared with Co3O4-NiO-NF. These significant shifts indicate that when forming Co3O4-NiO heterostructure, Co has a tendency of electrons to flow out compared with Co3O4-NF; and when Ru-doping is further realized to form Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF, Co atoms have a tendency of inflow of electrons compared with Co3O4-NiO-NF [25,62,62], which can be also justified by the Bader charge theoretical analysis (Fig S13). Similarly, the peaks corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 spin orbitals of Co3O4-NiO-NF are negatively shifted by 0.1 eV compared with single-component NiO-NF; whereas the BEs of Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF are positively shifted by 0.1 eV relative to Co3O4-NiO-NF (Fig. 3 d). These observations suggest that both Ru-doping and Co3O4-NiO heterointerface can introduce strong electronic interaction, thereby collectively modulating the electronic structure of the resulted Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF, which is highly desirable for optimizing the reduction of intermediate species in the subsequent alkaline HER process [63]."
9,Electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance,"3.2 Electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance The apparent electrochemical HER performance of the prepared electrode materials (i.e., Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF, Co3O4-NiO-NF, Co3O4-NF, NiO-NF and Pt-C-NF) are firstly evaluated via linear scan voltammetry (LSV) curves by using a typical three-electrode system in 1 M KOH solution. The samples prepared with ethanol as solvent and annealing for 2 h exhibit the best HER activity, especially at high current density (Fig. S14), and the optimized Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF described following are all synthesized with this protocol unless otherwise specified. Fig. 4 a presents the 85% iR-corrected LSV polarization curves of Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF and other related catalysts, and the curves without iR-corrected are also given in Fig. S15. As expected, the optimized Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF exhibits a much lower overpotential of 44 mV at 10 mA cm−2 than those of Co3O4-NiO-NF (119 mV), Co3O4-NF (140 mV), NiO-NF (250 mV) and bare NF (268 mV), comparable to the benchmark Pt-C-NF (32 mV). Impressively, when the current density reaches to 100 mA cm−2, the Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF still displays an extremely low overpotential (115 mV) and even surpassing that of Pt-C-NF (143 mV), which further confirms that the self-supported electrode can make the catalytic activity material more stable on the substrate under high current density, thereby having more excellent performance. Moreover, in order to eliminate the influence of catalysts loading, the mass-normalized LSV curves (Fig. 4 b) are also conducted and the results are consistent with the above apparent performance. Notably, comparing with recently reported Ru, Co and Ni-based electrocatalysts, the optimized Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF both has a relatively low overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH, thereby showing a decent alkaline HER application potential (Fig. 4 c and Table. S5). Then, the intrinsic activity of Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF and other related catalysts are investigated by a series of other electrochemical characterizations. The turnover frequency (TOF) values are firstly determined via the reduction peak area method (Fig. S16), and the calculated curves are displayed in Fig. 5 a. Obviously, the Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF presents the highest TOF value (2.4441 s−1) and current density (100 mA cm−2) relative to other samples at the overpotential of 115 mV (Co3O4-NiO-NF: 0.3647 s−1, 10.12 mA cm−2; Co3O4-NF: 0.1331 s−1, 7.708 mA cm−2; NiO-NF: 0.0126 s−1, 2.371 mA cm−2) (Fig. 5 b). Moreover, Tafel slopes derived from LSV curves are often used to reflect the interfacial kinetics of catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5 c, the Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF has the lowest Tafel slope (53.9 mV dec-1) in comparation with Pt-C-NF (72.3 mV dec-1), Co3O4-NiO-NF (171.1 mV dec-1), Co3O4-NF (165.8 mV dec-1), NiO-NF (141.5 mV dec-1) and bare NF (106.5 mV dec-1), confirming its excellent alkaline HER kinetics and Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism [64]. Likewise, the value of exchange current density (j0 ) indicates the inherent charge transfer or interaction between reactants and electrocatalysts [3]. Table. S3 presents that Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF has a large j0 (1.950 mA cm−2) as compared with other related catalysts. Besides, Fig. 5 d displays the Nyquist plots of electrocatalysts, which can reflect the consequence of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and demonstrate the charge transfer kinetics at the interface of electrode/electrolyte [65]. By fitting the Nyquist plots to the equivalent circuit, the resistance of the electrolyte (Rs ) and charge transfer resistance (R ct) can be obtained [66,67]. The values of Rct of the Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF electrode (0.743 Ω) are much lower than that of Co3O4-NiO-NF (8.192 Ω), Co3O4-NF (12.390 Ω), NiO-NF (51.294 Ω) and bare NF (44.851 Ω) (Fig. S17), indicating that Ru-doping and Co3O4-NiO heterointerface both can significantly reduce the impedance during electron transfer, leading to enhanced charge transfer kinetics [68]. To verify the superiority of the inherited 2D nanosheet morphology from Co-MOF precursor, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) is also evaluated by the double-layer capacitances (Cdl), where Cdl is calculated by measuring a series of cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in the non-Faradaic capacitance at scan rates varying from 10 to 200 mV s−1 (Fig. S18). As displayed in Fig. 5 e, the Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF has the highest Cdl value (37.7 mF cm−2) compared with Co3O4-NiO-NF (20.1 mF cm−2), Co3O4-NF (15.8 mF cm−2), NiO-NF (3.8 mF cm−2) and bare NF (2.7 mF cm−2). The ECSA values calculated by Cdl are shown in Table. S4, suggesting that the 2D nanosheet morphology inherited from Co-MOF precursor plays a beneficial role in exposing more active sites. As a supplement, Fig. S19 shows the specific activity at 0.1 V vs. RHE by ECSA-normalized. All the above results (the lowest Tafel slope and Rct, the highest TOF value, j0 and ECSA) confirm that the optimized Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF has an outstanding intrinsic activity. In addition, continuous hydrogen production capacity is of critical concern for effective HER catalysts. In this work, the stability of the as-prepared electrode materials has been evaluated by chronopotentiometry curve and a series of LSV curves after multiple cycle voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 5 f, the Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF can work continuously over 60 h at a relatively high current density of 100 mA cm−2 with only ~ 4.76 % decay, and the change of metal atoms (Co and Ru) content after stability test are basically ignorable (Table. S1). Similarly, after CV under different cycles (1000, 2000 and 3000), the resulted LSV curves show the negligible negative shifts (inset in Fig. 5 f), thus confirming the superior electrochemical operation durability in alkaline medium. Besides, the catalysts after stability test are further characterized by SEM, XRD and XPS to shed light on the mechanism of the outstanding HER activity. As shown in Fig. S20, there is no obvious change in the nanosheet morphology after long-term hydrogen production, implying that the robust 2D layered nanosheet structure will not be damaged by the bulging of gas-bubbles. Then, the crystal phase transition after HER stability test is investigated by XRD (Fig. S21). In detail, the diffraction peaks of Co3O4 and NiO disappeared, and new diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 19.1° and 37.9° are indexed to the (001) and (101) planes of Co(OH)2 (JCPDS no. 30–0443), indicating the phase transition from Ru-Co3O4-NiO to Ru-Co(OH)2. It is reported that the formation of Co(OH)2 phase is beneficial for accelerating the kinetics of water dissociation [21]. The increase of Co2+ peak and O–H peak in high-resolution XPS spectrum of Co 2p and O 1 s also identify the formation of Co(OH)2 phase (Fig. S22). In addition, the XPS spectrum of high-resolution Ni 2p and Ru 3p of Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF after HER stability test are also shown in Fig S22. They are no significant change compared with initial Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF except for a slight decrease in content."
10,Mechanism for the enhanced catalytic activity towards HER,"3.3 Mechanism for the enhanced catalytic activity towards HER Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to further unveil the mechanism of the enhanced HER catalytic activity. All the optimized absorption geometry models are exhibited in Fig. S23 (the detailed calculation method can be found in Supporting Information). It is common knowledge that the first process of alkaline HER is H2O adsorption and dissociation (the Volmer step), which can be simulated by the water adsorption energy (ΔEH2O*) and Gibbs free energy of water dissociation (ΔGH2O) [69]. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the ΔEH2O* for NiO (200), Co3O4 (311), Co3O4-NiO and Ru-Co3O4-NiO are −0.15 eV, −0.13 eV, −0.19 eV and −1.20 eV, respectively, manifesting that Ru-Co3O4-NiO is easier to adsorb the water molecules on active surface, thereby accelerating the alkaline HER kinetics. While the ΔGH2O of Ru-Co3O4-NiO (0.02 eV) is much lower than NiO (200) (0.54 eV), Co3O4 (311) (0.30 eV) and Co3O4-NiO (0.14 eV), which also suggesting the significantly improved alkaline HER kinetics. Both results are in good accordance with the above Tafel slope (Fig. 6 b). Furthermore, in order to prove the influence of electronic modulation on the alkaline HER process, the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) is calculated and displays in Fig. 6 c. Firstly, the ΔGH* of Co3O4-NiO is significantly reduced from single-phase NiO (200) (0.72 eV) and Co3O4 (311) (0.53 eV) to 0.17 eV, demonstrating the improved hydrogen bonding effect after forming Co3O4-NiO heterointerface. Impressively, when Ru is incorporated to form the Ru-Co3O4-NiO, the ΔGH* further decreases to −0.02 eV, indicating that Ru-Co3O4-NiO possesses a more optimized hydrogen binding energy with respect to other samples owing to the synergistically electronic modulation between Ru doping and Co3O4-NiO heterointerface. Likewise, the projected density of states (PDOS) of Ni, Co active sites suggest that the d-band center (εd) of Ru-Co3O4-NiO shifts to the Fermi energy (higher energy level) compared with that of the Co3O4-NiO, verifying its more optimized hydrogen adsorption and activation ability. In addition, the density of states (DOS) is also calculated to provide a deep insight in view of the electronic structure. As shown in Fig. 6 e, few electric energy densities can be observed in single-phase NiO and Co3O4 because of their poor conductivity. In contrast, the Ru-Co3O4-NiO has enabled more states around the Fermi energy, hence demonstrating its enhanced conductivity, which is also in line with the above electrochemical EIS results. To sum up, the theoretical calculation results solid that Ru doping and heterointerface stemming from Co3O4 and NiO can collectively modulate the electronic state of Ni, Co active sites and improve the conductivity effectively, thus promoting the H2O adsorption/dissociation and optimizing the hydrogen adsorption."
11,Conclusion,"In a nutshell, we design a MOF-derived Ru doped cobalt–nickel oxide heterostructure nanosheet arrays grown in situ on Ni foam (Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF) by a simple and scalable approach. The rational selection of Co-MOF precursor and well-designed thermal annealing process enable a conjoint engineering of morphology and electronic structure in constructing the optimal self-supported electrode materials. The as-prepared Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF can effectively preserve the advantageous 2D leaf-shaped nanosheet morphology of Co-MOF precursor and simultaneously maintain the mechanical strength and skeleton integrity of 3D Ni foam network, which are conducive to the exposure of active sites and the charge/mass transfer. Furthermore, XPS and DFT calculations confirm that Ru doping and Co3O4-NiO heterointerface can collectively regulate the electronic state of Ni and Co sites, thus promoting the H2O adsorption/dissociation and optimizing the hydrogen adsorption in the subsequent alkaline HER process. Benefiting from the synergistic engineering of morphology and electronic structure, the optimized Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF exhibits a superior electrocatalytic HER activity and stability in 1 M KOH, even better than the state-of-the-art Pt-C (20 wt%). This work not only provides a simple and scalable synthesis strategy to construct a MOF-derived self-supported electrode material, but also puts forward a new route to prepare the excellent alkaline HER electrocatalysts via synergistic engineering of morphology and electronic structure."
