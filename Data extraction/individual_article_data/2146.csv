0,Introduction,"Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) is a promising approach for hydrogen production from different biodegradable carbon sources by additionally applying voltage more than 0.2 V [1–3]. So far, Platinum (Pt) is an effective catalyst due to its low overpotential and high catalytic efficiency for hydrogen generation in MEC, but Pt is too expensive and easily poisoned by some contaminants in waste water, such as alcohols, carbon monoxide and sulfides [4–6]. Therefore, a low-cost and high efficient cathode is urgent to be develop to replace Pt catalytic cathodes for the MEC to become a commercialized hydrogen production technology. The urgency of finding a substitute for Pt catalyst attracted some of the best minds in material science. Recently, several non-Pt catalysts are investigated in MEC including biocatalyst [7,8], Nickel (Ni) and Ni – alloy [9–12], metal nanoparticles [13], and stainless steel (SS) [10,14–16]. Among these catalysts, SS is probably the most promising cathode material due to its low cost, commercially availability and good stability. At an applying voltage of 0.9 V, the SS flat sheet (A286) cathode can produce 1.5 m3 H2 m−3d−1 with 80% of hydrogen recovery and 46% of overall energy recovery [10]. The hydrogen producing rate was significantly enhanced to 2.1 ± 0.3 m3 H2 m−3d−1 with 98 ± 4% of hydrogen recovery and 74 ± 4% of overall energy recovery when using a SS mesh (#60) cathode with high surface area (66 m2 m−3) [14], which was still lower than that of Pt/C cathode [17]. The hydrogen producing rate of 1.7 ± 0.1 m3 H2 m−3d−1 with cathodic hydrogen recovery efficiency of 84% and overall energy recovery of 78 ± 5% were obtained at 0.6 V when using SS brush with even a higher surface area (810 m2 m−3, brush bristle loadings of 50%, 0.5 cm distance between electrodes) as cathode, which were comparable to Pt/C cathode [15]. Obviously, high surface area of cathodes have an positive effect on the performance of cathodes for hydrogen production. However, study showed that the electrodes distance is more important for high current density than the brush bristle loadings [15]. For brush bristle loadings of 50–100% (1.2 cm between the brush edges, 3.5 cm between the electrode midpoints), the current density remained around 90 A m−3. However, when reducing the electrode distance as close as possible (0.5 cm) by cut in half (50%), the current density could obtain 194 A m−3. Therefore, when the SS brush as cathode must be placed in closer to anode to minimize the ohmic losses, the bristles structure of SS brush cathodes are liable to induce a short circuit. Exploring and employing a novel SS cathode to overcome these disadvantages of SSM and SS brush cathodes is important for hydrogen production. Stainless steel fiber felt (SSFF), a commercially available and inexpensive open 3D porous filter material, bears such advantages as a high specific surface area, good conductivity and flexible mechanism for cut into different configurations easily. The SSFF anode modified by graphene in the microbial fuel cell (MFC) produced a maximum power density of 2124 mW m−2 (0.8 mW m−2 of unmodified SSFF anode), ascribing to its large surface area for graphene attachment and highly conductive scaffold [18]. Moreover, flame oxidation could easily generate in situ iron oxide film on SSFF and made its surface excellently biocompatible. When the anode was set at −0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the oxidized SSFF formed a thickness of ∼ 40 μm biofilm and obtained current output of 1.92 mA cm−2 compared to the untreated SSFF anode (0.06 mA cm−2 with bacteria only attached to certain points of untreated SSFF), indicating the SSFF is an ideal backbone for electrode design [19]. Based on these properties of SSFF, our team presented a novel high performance cathode with SSFF with carbon black loading of 1.56 mg cm−2 in the single air-cathode MFC which produced a maximum power density of 1315 mW m−2, which was 60% higher than that of CC cathodes [20]. However, there are no reports using SSFF as a cathode to improve the hydrogen production in MEC. In this study, we attempt to enhance the hydrogen production by using commercially available open 3D macroporous SSFF as cathodes (mean filter ratings 25 μm, 60 μm, 80 μm, 100 μm). We optimized the filter ratings of SSFF cathodes at different voltages (0.6 V, 0.9 V and 1.2 V) and further study the electrochemical properties and corrosion status of SSFF in the MEC over time."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Cathodes,"2.1 Cathodes The cathodes including SS cathodes and a Pt catalytic cathode. The stainless steel woven mesh (SSM, 316L, # 60) and stainless steel fiber felt (SSFF, 316 L, stainless steel fiber of ～20 μm in diameter, thin 0.6 mm, mean filter ratings 25 μm, 60 μm, 80 μm, 100 μm) were purchased from Xi'an Filter Metal Materials Co., Ltd. SSM and SSFF were cut into 3.8 cm diameter disks (project surface area of 7 cm2) and cleaned before use with DI water. A carbon cathode (Pt/C) of project surface area of 7 cm2 with Pt catalyst (0.5 mg-Pt/cm2, Hesen, China) and SSM cathode were used for comparison to SSFF cathodes."
3,MEC construction and operation,"2.2 MEC construction and operation In this study, single-chamber MEC reactors (28 mL) were constructed, as described by Call and Logan [17]. The anode electrodes were carbon fiber brush (2.5 cm in diameter and 3 cm long) made by twisting carbon fibers between two titanium wires. The cathodes were SSM, SSFF and Pt/C cathode. An Ag/AgCl reference electrode was placed in MEC and an anaerobic glass tube (total headspace volume of 90 mL) was glued to the top of each MEC for hydrogen collection. The carbon brush anodes were enriched biofilm in single air-cathode MFC, which inoculated the bacteria from the two-chamber MFC operated for a long period in our lab [21]. 5 mL of bacteria suspension and 20 mL of nutrient medium were immited into the air-cathode MFC. Nutrient medium (per liter) contained: sodium acetate 1 g; K2HPO4·12H2O, 6.271 g; KH2PO4·2H2O, 3.978 g; NH4Cl, 0.31; KCl, 0.13 g; trace minerals (12.5 mL) and vitamins (5 mL) [22]. When the air-cathode MFC achieved the maximum voltage for at least 3 cycles, the carbon brush bioanodes were considered acclimated, then were transferred to the single-chamber MEC. The MEC was fed the same medium as the air-cathode MFC and operated in batch mode. Considering the effect of methane, 10 mM 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid was added into the MEC to inhibit the methane generation [23]. After filled with the fresh medium, the reactors were flushed with nitrogen gas (purity > 99.999%) for 15 min to deoxygenate. All batch experiments were operated in a constant temperature room (35 °C). A DC power supply was used to apply voltages of 0.6 V, 0.9 V and 1.2 V. The cathodic potentials and the voltages across a 10Ω resistor were continuously recorded at 1 min intervals by a data acquisition system (CT-3008-5V50 mA-S4, Xinwei, China). The current of MEC was determined by measuring the voltage across a 10Ω resistor. All potentials were reported here versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode."
4,MEC tests,"2.3 MEC tests The tests were operated in batch mode and each test was run for at least 4 consecutive cycles. To optimize the filter rating of SSFF, three specified voltages (Eap = 0.6 V, 0.9 V and 1.2 V) were applied by a DC power and new cathodes were used for each applied voltage. At the next stage, the SSM cathode and Pt/C cathode were used for a comparison to the SSFF cathode with the optimum pore size at a suitable applied voltage. After each batch test, the hydrogen was detected and the total chemical demand (COD) was analyzed. The performance of cathodes was in terms of hydrogen production rate (Q, m3H2 m−3d−1), current density (A m−2, based on projected area of 7 cm2), hydrogen recovery efficiency (%) and energy recovery efficiency (%)."
5,Analytics and calculation,"2.4 Analytics and calculation Electrochemical properties of the cathodes were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using an electrochemical working station (CHI 604E, ChenHua Instruments Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). CV was employed to measure the electrochemical active areas of SS cathodes using a ferrocyanide solution [14,24,25]. A solution containing 5 mM ferrocyanide and 0.2 M Na2SO4 was placed in a 28 mL electrochemical cell, and flushed with ultrapure nitrogen gas (purity > 99.999%) for 30 min to deoxygenate. A three-electrode system was used for measurements, consisting of a working electrode (SS cathode), a counter electrode (platinum mesh, projected surface area of 2 cm2) and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (218, Shanghai REX Instrument Factory sat KCl, 197 mV vs. SHE). CV was performed within a potential window between −0.5 and 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The electrochemical active areas (A) of SS cathodes were calculated using the well known Matsuda's equation [25]: (1) i P = 0.4464 × 10 − 3 n 3 / 2 F 3 / 2 A ( R T ) − 1 / 2 D R 1 / 2 C R ∗ v 1 / 2 where i P is the peak current (A), n = 1 is the number of electrons transferred, F = 96487C mol−1 e− Faraday's constant, R = 8.314 J mol−1 K the gas constant, T = 308 K is the temperature, C R ∗ = 0.005 mol L−1 the initial ferrocyanide concentration, v = 0.05 V s−1 the scan rate. D R = 3.31 × 10 − 6 cm2 s−1 is the diffusion coefficient of K4Fe(CN)6 calculated from the value of i P using Eq. (1) with a SS flat sheet working electrode (A = 7 cm2). This value is comparable with previously reported ( 2.66 × 10 − 6 , 30 °C) [14]. LSV tests were conducted over a potential range from – 0.4 V to – 1.4 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (35 °C) in 50 mM PBS solution, and the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode were the same as the CV tests. The COD was measured by the standard method of potassium dichromate titration. Hydrogen gas was detected by gas chromatography with the same procedures as our previous work [26]. The morphologies of SSFF and SSM cathodes were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; S-4300, Hitachi, Japan). The composition of the SSFF and SSM were measured by SEM-EDS (S-4300, Hitachi, Japan). Hydrogen recovery including coulombic efficiency (r CE, %), cathodic hydrogen recovery efficiency (r cat , %) and overall hydrogen recovery efficiency, r H2, %), energy recovery including electrical energy input recovery (η W, %) substrate energy input recovery (η S, %) and overall energy recovery (η W+E, %) were calculated as previously described [17]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Electrochemical active area of SS cathodes,"3.1 Electrochemical active area of SS cathodes The electrochemical active areas of SS cathodes including SSM and several different filter ratings SSFF cathodes were measured by CV tests in K4Fe(CN)6 solution. The peak current values of SSFF were higher than that of SSM (Fig S2, Table 1 ), showing that the SSFF cathodes had larger electrochemical activity areas (from 181 m2 m−3 to 168 m2 m−3) than that of SSM (61 m2 m−3) due to the macroporous 3D configuration of SSFF (Fig S1). Moreover, the smaller filter rating of SSFF had a larger electrochemical activity area as shown in Table 1 (181 m2 m−3 of 25 μm filter rating and 168 m2 m−3 of 100 μm filter rating), indicating that the filter rating had an effect on electrochemical activity area."
8,Optimization of filter rating of SSFF cathodes,"3.2 Optimization of filter rating of SSFF cathodes Optimization of filter rating of SSFF were operated in terms of current densities and cathode potentials in the MEC for hydrogen production at the applied voltages of 0.6 V, 0.9 V and 1.2 V, respectively. The current densities produced by different filter ratings of SSFF cathodes increased as the applied voltages becoming even higher (Fig. 1 A). At 0.6 V, the current densities of SSFF cathodes decreased slightly with the filter ratings getting larger (5.94 ± 0.05 A m−2 of SSFF-25 vs. 5.85 ± 0.3 A m−2 of SSFF-100), which could result from the larger electrochemically active area of SSFF-25. At 0.9 V, the current densities produced by SSFF cathodes increased slightly as the filter rating getting larger (16.26 ± 0.29 A m−2 of SSFF-25 vs. 17.29 ± 1.68 A m−2 of SSFF-100), which indicated that the filter rating had become an limit factor for producing higher current density. Moreover, when applying an even higher voltage (1.2 V), the effect of filter rating on current density had become more obvious. The current density produced by SSFF-25 (15.16 ± 0.56 A/m2) at 1.2 V was even lower than that at 0.9 V due to its small filter rating compared to the SSFF-100 cathode. Cathodic potential measure showed that there is a negative effect of using smaller filter ratings when the applied voltages become larger (Fig. 1B). At 0.9 V, the cathodic potentials get slightly more positive as the filter rating becoming larger (−0.99 ± 0.01 V of SSFF-25 vs. −0.97 ± 0.02 V of SSFF-100), and the cathodic potentials were more positive substantially at the high applied voltage of 1.2 V (−1.16 ± 0.02 V of SSFF-25 vs. −1.05 ± 0.01 V of SSFF-100), which indicated that SSFF-100 had lower cathodic overpotential than those of other filter ratings of SSFF cathodes. The trends of current densities and cathodic potentials at different applied voltages suggested that the filter rating of the SSFF cathode had a more significant effect on current density production and cathodic potential than electrochemically active area at the filter rating ranges of 25–100 μm, which were similar with the preciously report on SSM cathode [14] even the SSFF had larger electrochemical activity areas (from 181 m2 m−3 to 168 m2 m−3) than that of SSM. This trends could be ascribed to potential hydrogen gas bubble holdup in small filter ratings which decreased the current density and increased the cathodic overpotential [14,15,27]. At 0.6 V, the current densities were low (<6 A m−2), the bubble capture of small filter rating is not obviously, while the current densities become larger with the increasing applied voltages (0.9 V and 1.2 V), the gas bubbles become trapped within small filter rating (25 μm), the current density was decreased and overpotential was increased. Hence, SSFF-100 cathode had an superior performance on producing higher current densities with lower cathodic overpotentials than those of other filter ratings of SSFF."
9,Current density and cathode potential of different cathodes,"3.3 Current density and cathode potential of different cathodes A comparison of SSM cathode, Pt/C cathode and SSFF-100 cathode was conducted at Eap = 0.9 V. As shown in Fig. 2 , the SSFF-100 cathode produced greater average current density (Fig. 2A) and lower cathodic overpotential (Fig. 2B) than those of SSM cathode and Pt/C cathode, likely due to the larger electrochemical active area of SSFF-100 with an open 3D macroporous structure compared to the other two cathodes. The average current density of SSFF-100 achieved 17.29 ± 1.68 A m−2 (484.08 ± 46.97 A m−3), which was about 1.67 times and 1.15 times of that of SSM cathode and Pt/C cathode, respectively. Moreover, it showed that there were an increase in current densities and a decrease in cathodic overpotentials of the SSFF-100 cathode over time, but the cycle 3 and cycle 4 achieved reasonably stable current densities (18.40 A m−2 and 18.47 A m−2) and cathodic potential (～ −0.97 V). This trend could be attributed to the corrosion of SSFF-100, in accordance with the previous report which pointed that the SS corrosion products were beneficial for hydrogen revolution reaction [15,16,28–30]. Conversely, the Pt/C cathode showed a decrease in current densities and a increase in cathodic overpotentials, which might be on account of the inactivation of Pt catalyst in the MEC. The slight decrease in current densities and slight increase in cathodic overpotentials, which might be attributed a slighter corrosion occurred on the SSM than that of SSFF-100 cathode. The hydrogen evolution reaction enhanced by corrosion products of stainless steel cathode could be attributed to cathodic electrochemical deprotonation of phosphate species on stainless steel identified in corrosion which phosphate species act as a homogeneous catalyst of hydrogen evolution in stainless steel/phosphate species system [16,29,30]. Further investigation on SSFF corrosion and its impact on cathodic electrochemical deprotonation of phosphate species or other weak acid for hydrogen formation is needed in our further research."
10,Hydrogen production and energy recovery,"3.4 Hydrogen production and energy recovery At 0.9 V, the maximum hydrogen generation rate (Q) with SSFF-100 cathode (3.66 ± 0.43 m3 H2 m−3d−1) was comparable with that of Pt/C cathode (3.75 ± 0.03 m3 H2 m−3d−1) and superior to that of SSM cathode (1.50 ± 0.040 m3 H2 m−3d−1) (Fig. 3 A). Fig. 3B showed that the coulombic efficiencies (r CE) of SSM and SSFF-100 cathodes achieved 121.83 ± 4.56% and 114.70 ± 22.54%, respectively, which were higher than that of Pt/C cathode (92.76 ± 9.58%). The values of r CE exceeded 100%, indicating that electrons recycling occurred through using hydrogen as an electron donor by the bioanode [31–33]. The cathodic hydrogen recovery efficiencies (r cat) of SS cathodes were lower than that of Pt/C cathode (45.71 ± 0.82% of SSM, 66.56 ± 2.07% of SSFF-100 and 78.94 ± 1.11% of Pt/C cathode). However, the overall hydrogen recovery efficiency of SSFF-100 was slightly higher than that of Pt/C cathode (76.37 ± 15.04% vs. 73.23 ± 7.68%). The energy recovery efficiencies of different cathodes at 0.9 V were showed in Fig. 3C. The SSFF-100 cathode was better than SSM cathode and performed as well as Pt/C in energy recovery efficiency although the electrical energy input recovery of SSFF-100 was lower than that of Pt/C cathode. The SSFF-100 cathode obtained 394.39 ± 12.25% in electrical energy input recovery, 100.33 ± 19.76% in substrate energy input recovery and 79.61 ± 13.07% in over energy recovery."
11,Linear sweep voltammetry,"3.5 Linear sweep voltammetry After four cycles of operation, LSV tests were conducted on the SS cathodes before and after use (Fig. 4 ). SSFF-100 cathode was more effective in increasing current and decreasing cathodic overpotential than SSM cathode due to the larger electrochemical active area of SSFF-100. The current of SSFF-100 increased significantly before used when the cathode potential was more negative than −0.68 V, while it increased significantly after continuously used when the cathode potential was more negative than −0.66 V, which indicated a decrease of 0.02 V on overpotential of SSFF-100 cathode after used (based on the theoretical cathode potential for hydrogen production, −0.62 V vs. Ag/AgCl). However, there was no obvious change in cathodic overpotential of SSM cathode except an decrease in current. LSV tests proved that the electrochemical performance of SSFF-100 cathode was superior to that of SSM cathode, which was in agreement with the results of current densities and cathode potentials of SSM and SSFF cathodes in the MEC test."
12,Cathodes corrosion,"3.6 Cathodes corrosion After the MEC test, the SS cathodes, before and after used for 4 cycles, were investigated by SEM (Fig. 5 ). The SSFF-100 cathode and SSM cathode surface were smooth (Fig. 5 A and C), but there were some black spots on them after used (Fig. 5 B and D), which may be the corrosion products of SS cathodes. SEM-EDS showed the composition of SS cathodes before and after use (Table 2 ). There was little component change in the SSM before and after use in the MEC, but the changes of chromium and iron contents were greater in SSFF-100. Although the corrosion that occurred on the surface of SSFF-100 was more severe than on SSM, the hydrogen production performance of it was superior to that of SSM because the SS corrosion products were beneficial for hydrogen revolution reaction. The corrosion of SSFF cathode could be balanced by the more excellent performance for hydrogen evolution than that of SSM cathode and lower price than that of Pt catalytic cathode. Moreover, the main advantage of SSFF over SSM is the large active area. Thus, the excellent hydrogen production performance of the MEC may be the joint effect of the corrosion and the large active area when using SSFF as cathode."
13,Conclusions,"Stainless steel fiber felt (SSFF) with a 3D macroporous structure was used as cathode in MEC for producing hydrogen. Compared stainless steel mesh (SSM), the SSFF owns more lager electrochemical active, which produce higher current density with lower cathodic overpotential than that of SSM. In this study, the excellent performances exhibited by SSFF in terms of current density, hydrogen producing rate and hydrogen recovery, energy recovery, is comparable to Pt/C cathode. It is believed that the SSFF is a low-cost and high efficient cathode to replace Pt catalytic cathode, and make the MEC to be commercialized."
