0,Introduction,"During the manufacturing of cane sugar, a large amount of molasses is produced. Sugar refineries typically use molasses to produce alcohol, and for 1ton of alcohol produced, 13–15tons of wastewater (i.e., MAW) are typically generated. MAW contains approximately 88% molasses (Jain et al., 2002), and its components vary with different alcohol production techniques and operation methods. MAW typically has relatively high COD and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), as well as elevated phosphate, sulfate, and organic carbon content. In addition, MAW is highly corrosive, acidic, with a pH value 3.5–5, and contains a relatively high content of solids (Wilkie et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2000). MAW also contains 2% melanoidin (a dark brown pigment) with complex components, which have not been fully elucidated (Kalavathi et al., 2001; Rivero-Peˇırez et al., 2002). Melanoidin has antioxidant effects, and is toxic to microbes present in MAW treatment (Sirianuntapiboon et al., 2004). Besides melanoidin, there are other colorants in MAW, such as melanin, caramel and phenolics (Satyawali and Balakrishnan, 2008). Direct emissions of MAW can cause serious pollution to the environment, leading to problems such as hypoxia and deterioration of water quality in discharge streams. The melanin contained in MAW can also block sunlight, interfere with photosynthesis of aquatic organisms, and thus affect their activities (Fitzgibbon et al., 1998). Studies on the treatment of MAW have been carried out for many years. A range of biological and physico-chemical methods have been investigated, which collectively suggest microbial fermentation of MAW to biogas as a promising approach to effectively treat this waste stream (Satyawali and Balakrishnan, 2008). But a comprehensive treatment scheme for MAW leading to effective removal of both organics and color is not available. Although biological methods especially anaerobic treatment have been employed extensively as the first treatment step on a variety of industrial wastewater, there is no successful researches on anaerobic treatment for MAW. The treatment processes of MAW with microbiorganisms have been rarely reported recently. Jain and his co-workers found that the CODremoval of MAW is up to 66–81% with Xanthomonas fragariae, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus and additional carbon and nitrogen sources (Jain et al., 2002). Sirianuntapiboon and co-workers demonstrated that acetogenic bacteria No.BP103 can reduce COD of MAW to 35.5–71.2% in the medium containing glucose 3.0%, yeast extract 0.5%, KH2PO4 0.1% and MgSO4·7H2O 0.05% (Sirianuntapiboon, 2004). Kumar and Chandra reported that Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus sp. decrease COD of MAW to 41–63% (Kumar and Chandra, 2006). What is more, the treatment system with multilevel procedures, such as combined anaerobic digestion and ultraviolet photodegradation and consisting of an acidification reactor, an upflow staged sludge bed (USSB) reactor, an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor and an aerobic trickling filter were studied (Apollo et al., 2013; Onodera et al., 2013), which appears a high cost. There is thus an urgent need to develop integrated treatment processes to treat MAW. The development of industrialization and urbanization, and population growth has simultaneously increased environmental pollution and the demand for energy. Anaerobic fermentation of wastewater and residues to produce methane have been both extensively studied and widely applied. Technologies in anaerobic fermentation of domestic wastewater, anaerobic fermentation of a variety of animal manures, and anaerobic fermentation of industrial wastewater and wastes have achieved satisfactory economic and environmental benefits (Schomaker et al., 2000). However, components of the organic carbon present in MAW are difficult to process and reports of successful fermentation of MAW to methane are lacking. One challenge of MAW fermentation lies in the imbalance of carbon to nitrogen ratios (up to above 120). In addition, MAW is rich in sulfate, sulfate-reducing bacteria compete with methanogens during the anaerobic bio-digestion process (Hilton and Archer, 1988). Anaerobic co-digestion of animal manures and organic wastes or wastewater is currently undergoing new developments and rapid expansion, and there have been many reports on successful application of this technology that produces methane, e.g., that by Neves et al. (Mshandete et al., 2004). In the present study, co-digestion of PM and MAW was performed under laboratory conditions to explore optimal ratio of PM to MAW, which in effect modulates the C/N ratio, for the optimal anaerobic conversion to biogas. In addition, next generation sequencing methods were applied to characterize the structure and composition of bacterial communities in early and late stages of fermentation. A better understanding of microbial activities and community structures should aid in evaluation and control of process operation, and is significant for investigation of degradation mechanism. The results of this study provide unique insight into the interplay between nutrient composition, bacterial community structure, and gas production during the anaerobic treatment of MAW."
1,Methods,
2,Establishment of methane fermentation device,"2.1 Establishment of methane fermentation device Brown jars of 5.5L with a working volume of 4L were used as fermentation tanks. Each jar was sealed with a rubber stopper. In the rubber stopper, there was a sampling port and an air duct, the air tightness of which was ensured. Starting fermentation liquid was obtained from IC reactor that was in the process of treating bagasse spray wastewater from Guangxi Guitang (Group) Co. Ltd., and MAW was wastewater produced from alcohol production of cane molasses (concentrated 6 times) from the same company. Wastewater was subjected to 10-fold dilution prior to initiation of preliminary fermentation experiments. Based on the preliminary results, COD ratios of PM to MAW were set as H1 (1.0:0.0), H2 (1.0:1.0), H3 (1.0:1.5) and H4 (1.0:2.0), total COD was 5000mg/mL, respectively. Three replicate reactors were set up for each PM to MAW ratio. The starting fermentation liquid was diluted to 20% before use and fermentation was allowed to proceed at 37°C for 81days."
3,Sample collection,"2.2 Sample collection Samples were collected on the 2nd (early stage) and 81st (late stage) day of fermentation. A, B, C and D were numbers of samples collected from tanks H1, H2, H3 and H4 on the 2nd day, respectively, and SA, SB, SC and SD were numbers of samples collected from tanks H1, H2, H3 and H4 on the 81st day, respectively. Prior to sample collection, fermentation tanks were shaken to homogenous contents and fermentation liquid in the middle of the tank was collected. About 100g samples were collected. Part of the sample was stored in −80°C freezer for further analysis."
4,Analysis methods,"2.3 Analysis methods Biogas was collected during the fermentation process using the saturated brine displacement method. The volume of the produced biogas was determined by measuring the volume of displaced saturated brine. Gas chromatography was applied to quantify the methane content in biogas produced during the course of the fermentation. A Shimadzu GC-14C (Shimadzn Co. Ltd., Japan) gas chromatograph was used employing a 0.3mm×2m capillary column and a stationary phase Porapak Q (80–100 mesh) column and FID detector. Inlet temperature was set as 100°C, column temperature was set to 60°C, and the detector temperature was set to 100°C. The hydrogen gas pressure was set as 40Kpa, the pressure of the nitrogen carrier gas was set to 65Kpa, and the pressure of oxygen was maintained at 30Kpa. Manual injection was applied, and the injection volume was 3μL. The concentration of methane was determined by comparison of peak areas determined from a standard sample (99.9% methane). COD was measured using potassium dichromate method (Andrew et al., 2005)."
5,DNA extraction and PCR amplification,"2.4 DNA extraction and PCR amplification Extraction of genomic DNA from the samples was performed using the FastDNA® Spin Kit for Soil (Q-BIOgene, Carlsbad, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR primers F357 and R518 (Muyzer et al., 1993) were used for amplification of the V3 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. PCR conditions were: 10×PCR buffer, 0.25mmol/L dNTPs, primers 0.4μmol/L each, and 1U Ex Taq polymerase (TaKaRa Company, Japan), sample DNA template 10ng, and molecular grade water added to make a total volume of 25μL. PCR amplification conditions were: pre-denaturation 95°C for 5min followed by 25 cycles of stepdown PCR at 94°C for 45s, 65–55°C 30s (annealing temperature dropped from 65 to 56°C, reduced by 1°C every two cycles and 5 cycles for 55°C at the end), 72°C 1min, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 8min. The size (∼200 base pairs) and concentration of the PCR product was verified and quantified agarose gel electrophoresis. In order to remove false positive products, the above PCR product was recovered and purified to serve as template, and reconditioning PCR was performed as the second amplification, in order to obtain PCR product with higher specificity. Reconditioning PCR system contained: 10×PCR buffer, 0.25mmol/L dNTPs, primers 0.4μmol/L each, 2U Ex Taq polymerase (TaKaRa), PCR product 5μL, and distilled water was added to make a total volume of 50μL. Reconditioned PCR conditions were: pre-denaturation 95°C for 5min followed by 5 cycles of 94°C for 1min, 55°C for 1min, and 72°C for 1min followed by a final extension at 72°C for 10min. The size and concentration of the PCR was determined as described above and the product was further purified with a DNA purification kit (BioFlux, Japan)."
6,Sequencing and analysis of V3 region of 16S rRNA gene,"2.5 Sequencing and analysis of V3 region of 16S rRNA gene DNA concentration of purified PCR product was measured using DNA detection kit Quant-iT™ dsDNA BR Assay Kit. For each sample, 3–5μg DNA was used to construct small-fragment library for sequencing, which was conducted by Shenzhen Huada Genomics Technology Co. Ltd. High-throughput sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq 2000 sequencing system, and about 3.97Gb raw data were obtained from 8 samples. After linker sequences, low-complexity sequences and low-quality sequences were removed. Sequence assembly software self-developed by Huada Co. was used to assemble sequence reads. After assembly, primers were removed from the obtained sequence, and the two ends of the sequence were compared with upstream and downstream amplification primers for matching. The requirements were that the 4 bases at the 3′ end of the primer must completely match the sequence (3′ end of primer was conservative), and among the remaining bases in the primer sequence, 4 mismatches were allowed at most. Sequences that met this requirement were target sequences, and were named as tag. The Mothur (Schloss et al., 2009) software package (1.22.2–2) was used for redundant sequence removal of tag sequences, and unique tag sequences were selected (each of these sequences was in fact a representative of a set of identical tag sequences). BLASTN was used to align unique tag sequences with 16S rRNA V3 database (Huse et al., 2008). Unique tag sequences failed to find a match were marked as NA. Those that found multiple matches were analyzed using majority rule, i.e., if 66% of the alignment results supported the same species, then the tag was marked as that species, otherwise the same process was done at the rank above. If the majority rule was not applicable for all BLAST results, the tag was also marked as NA. Single-linkage preclustering (SLP) method (Huse et al., 2010) was used to sort the obtained unique tag sequences from high to low abundance. Pre-clustering was done based on a difference of 0.02 (or 98% similarity). After pre-clustering, Mothur software was used to calculate the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a distance of 0.03 (or 97% similarity). For each OTU, if the species remarks of over 66% tags supported the same species taxon, this species taxon was determined to be the species taxon of that OTU. According to the relative content of each species based on the best classification, Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed by SPSS 12.0, and found out which organism contributed most to bacterial differences among different samples."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Biogas production and COD removal,"3.1 Biogas production and COD removal In the preliminary experiment, it was found that when COD ratio of PM to MAW was larger than 1:3, biogas yield was low and fermentation was difficult to run. Therefore, 4 ratios lower than this (e.g., 1.0:0, 1.0:1.0, 1.0:1.5, and 1.0:2.0) were used for the main experiment. Daily biogas yields and cumulative biogas yields of different anaerobic digestors during fermentation were showed in Fig. 1 . The yield of daily biogas on days 1–8 in reactors H2, H3 and H4, all of which contained MAW, was higher than that of H1 which contained only PM. In particular, the biogas yield associated with reactor tank H3 was the highest. On day 9–22, biogas yield of H1 increased dramatically and the daily yield reached 8L, higher than that of any other reactors. This observation may be attributable to the limiting nutrient conditions in the PM only fermentation or the hydrolysis of biopolymers (Bonmatí et al., 2001). In the case of the later scenario, proteins, carbohydrates (mainly celluloses), lipids and other substances in PM must be hydrolyzed before they can be fermented and ultimately converted to biogas. In contrast, MAW contains carbohydrates (mono- and di-saccharides) that are suitable for fermentation and conversion to methane. Thus, the lag phase observed in the H1 reactors, which contained only PM, when compared to PM+MAW reactors (H2, H3, and H4) may reflect differences in the availability of fermentable substrates, the products of which can then be converted to biogas. As fermentation continues, PM fermentation starts to enter its peak, whereas fermentation in tanks H2, H3 and H4 has begun to enter the stationary phase. At the end of the experiment, methane contents in the total gas of 4 fermentation tanks were in the range of 67–72%. Comparison showed that biogas yield of H3 was the highest, followed by H4, H1, and finally H2. Time of the highest biogas yield for fermentation tank H1 was the first 25days, that for H2 was the first 33days, for H3, the first 48days, for H4, the first 64days. Cumulative biogas yields of tanks H1, H2, H3 and H4 were 100.8±6.2L, 92.6±2.1L, 170.7±3.2L and 167.3±0.9L, and CODremoval ratio were 68.1±0.5%, 54±3.2%, 62±1.2% and 59±1.6%, respectively. In the process of fermentation that produces biogas, ratios of feedstock are critical. In particular, carbon: nitrogen ratio is critical, and at a ratio of 20:1 is optimal (Zeshan et al., 2012). In MAW, C/N ratio is as high as about 120:1. A disproportion of carbon, including some non-usable carbon, to nitrogen can result in acidification during fermentation. The C/N ratio in PM is about 13:1. This relatively low content of carbon hinders continuous biogas production in the fermentation of pure PM, and can easily cause accumulation of ammonia nitrogen, resulting in high pH of the fermentation liquid. Therefore, in the present study, co-digestion of PM and MAW was performed so that imbalances in C/N ratio during the fermentation of either PM or MAW alone could be modulated. In addition, by adding PM to MAW, the increased nitrogen content also increased the buffering capacity of the system against H2S toxicity, compared to fermentation of MAW alone. Co-digestion can dilute substances that have toxic effects on microbes in MAW. Results on cumulative biogas yield showed that in fermentation of PM alone, duration of continuous biogas production was relatively short, as biogas yield drastically decreased after 20days of fermentation. In contrast, in fermentation reactors that contained both PM and MAW, the duration of biogas production was comparably longer. At different PM to MAW ratios, peak biogas yields reached at different times. Reactor H2 reached peak biogas production on day. Peak biogas yield was observed in reactor H3 on day 48 whereas biogas production peaked in reactor H4 on day 64. These observations may be attributable to organic matters in PM is relatively simple and can be depleted more easily, whereas those in co-digestion need more time to be fully degraded. A similar observation has also been observed in the co-digestion of crude glycerol and PM (Astals et al., 2012). The different biogas production time and biogas yields of different PM to MAW ratios suggest that low additions of MAW may inhibit biogas production when pointing to an optimum ratio of PM to MAW. This also may reflect differences in the composition of the communities present in each reactor due to nutrient amendment. Differing communities can be expected to harbor differences in metabolism which may influence biogas production. Techniques in anaerobic fermentation using a mixture of PM or other animal manure and agricultural wastes to produce biogas have become relatively mature, as reported in Reith et al. (2003). However, to date there has been no report on co-digestion of MAW with PM or other feedstock. In the present study, laboratory experiment showed that different PM to MAW ratios led to different fermentation results. That PM to MAW ratio 1.0:1.5 is optimal for biogas production and COD removal, maybe because at this ratio, nutrients in the feedstock not only complement each other, but also dilute each other’s inhibitory effects. This phenomenon has been observed in a number of other co-digestion systems (Lehtomäki et al., 2007; Lateef et al., 2012; Sutaryo et al., 2012; Westerholm et al., 2012)."
9,Bacterial diversity analysis,"3.2 Bacterial diversity analysis The bacterial diversity of the reactors was investigated by comparing the composition and structure of bacterial 16S rRNA genes obtained by high throughput multiplex sequence analysis. The sequencing results were showed in Table 1 . Sequence analysis indicated that more than 60% of sequences could be accurately classified at the family level. Less than 50% of sequences could be accurately classified at the genus level. These data suggested the presence of novel microbial diversity in the reactors and thus all comparisons were made at the family taxonomic rank in order to not bias interpretation. Amendment of reactors with MAW resulted in significant shifts in the composition of bacterial assemblages during the course of the fermentation (Fig. 2 ). The composition of bacterial assemblages, when binned at the family level of taxonomic classification, showed marked differences between treatments and during the course of the incubation period for each particular treatment. After the first day of fermentation, the majority of microbes in all four tanks were family Ruminococcaceae within the phylum Firmicutes where they accounted for 15.9%, 11.3%, 13.8% and 13.4% of all microbes in tanks H1, H2, H3 and H4, respectively. The next most abundant family was family Lachnospiraceae within the phylum Firmicutes where they accounted for 11.6%, 10.5%, 13.5% and 11.5% of all microbes in tanks H1, H2, H3 and H4, respectively. The proportion of bacteria in family Prevotellaceae of phylum Bacteroidetes was also relatively high, which were found to account for 3.6%, 15.1%, 21.9% and 11.8% of all microbes in tanks H1, H2, H3 and H4, respectively. The proportions of family Syntrophomonadecea in phylum Firmicutes were 12.9%, 9.2%, 2.9% and 12.1% in tanks H1, H2, H3 and H4, respectively. In addition, there is also a fair amount of Moraxellaceae in phylum and Clostridiaceae in phylum Firmicutes. In the late stage of fermentation, the contents of some above bacteria were generally rather low. For example, in tanks H1, H2, H3 and H4, the proportion of sequences affiliated with Ruminococcaceae was 3.1%, 0.9%, 5.0% and 5.6%, respectively, reduced by l5.2 times, 1.3 times, 2.8 times and 2.3 times compared to early stage of fermentation, respectively. The proportion of sequences affiliated with the family Lachnospiraceae in the late stage of fermentation was 0.6%, 3.6%, 2.0% and 2.3%, respectively, reduced by 25, 2.9, 6.7, and 5 times, respectively. Similarly, the proportion of sequences affiliated with the family Prevotella spp. was 1.1%, 3.9%, 6.1% and 10.0%, and reduced by 3, 3.7, 3.5, and 1.1 times, respectively. But there were also bacterial populations that increased in relative abundance in the late stage of fermentation. The largest increase was observed in sequences affiliated with the Syntrophomonadecea family which increased in abundance by 5.0, 4.5, 20.0 and 3.9 times in tanks H1, H2, H3 and H4 compared to early stage of fermentation, respectively, and became the most abundant constituent. The proportion of sequences affiliated with the Clostridiaceae family increased in relative abundance by 4.2, 3.9, 4.8, and 2.9 times, respectively. Principal component analysis showed that family Prevotellaceae was found to contribute most to bacterial differences among different samples (Fig. 3 ). These bacteria are strict anaerobes and can typically degrade carbohydrates into acetic acid and succinic acid, etc. (Corentine et al., 2010). Their content in tank H1 in the early stage of fermentation was relatively low, because in pure PM, carbohydrate content is rather low. In tanks H2, H3 and H4, where MAW was added, the amount of Prevotellaceae was drastically larger in the early stage of fermentation compared to H1. However in the late stage of fermentation, as macromolecular carbohydrates were presumably becoming depleted, their relative abundance decreased. This also demonstrates the advantage of co-digestion of PM and MAW from the perspective of microbial nutrition. The largest change observed during the fermentation process occurred in Syntrophomonadaceae family. These bacteria belong to phylum Firmicutes, and are a type of hydrogen-producing and acetic acid-producing bacteria (Gray et al., 2011). Members of this family typically can degrade mid-chain and short-chain fatty acids, such as propionic acid, butyric acid and valeric acid and in the process producing hydrogen and acetic acid. Studies have shown that hydrogen-producing and acetic acid-producing bacteria can only degrade mid-chain and short-chain fatty acids into acetic acid and hydrogen when they are in symbiosis with methanogenic bacteria (Zhang et al., 2004). This is because without methanogenic bacteria, the produced acetic acid and hydrogen cannot be consumed, and will cause feedback inhibition through thermodynamic inhibition. Neither methanogenic bacteria or hydrogen-producing and acetic acid-producing bacteria are capable of degrading short-chain fatty acids, hence the proportion of these bacteria is relatively high only in the late stage of fermentation. In the late stage of fermentation, biodegradable macromolecules have mostly been degraded to small molecules already, thus contents of bacteria populations that are dominant in the early stage of fermentation decrease due to lack of growth substrates. Increases in small molecules, such as propionic acid, butyric acid and valeric acid, etc., may thus lead to enrichment of bacteria such as family Syntrophomonadaceae. In tanks H1, H2, H3 and H4, the proportions of these bacteria increased by 4.98, 4.48, 19.8, and 3.9 times, respectively. The proportional increase in this family of bacteria was found to be the largest in fermentation tank H3 (mass to volume ratio of PM to MAW 1:1), suggesting that this ratio is most conducive to methane production. Clostridiaceae is a type of Firmicutes commonly seen in anaerobic fermentation, and is related to cellulose degradation (Roland et al., 2012; Juergen et al., 2006). They can be also found in the late stage of fermentation in the degradation of cellulose-rich wastes. For example, after 40–60days of anaerobic fermentati metagenomic sequencing analyses of sludge samples have shown that Clostrida is the primary microbial populations responsible for cellulose degradation in reactors containing corn stalks (63% of total sequences), rye (35% of total sequences) and chicken manure (2% of total sequences) (Schlüter et al., 2008). Clostrida increased to different extents in the late stage of fermentation compared to early stage, by 6–7 times. This observation may be attributable to the fact that cellulose must be hydrolyzed before it can be fermented, which may have occurred at a later point (40–60days) during the operation of the reactor. There have not been many studies on anaerobic fermentation of sugarcane MAW for biogas production. Guangxi Guitang (Group) Co., Ltd. attempted co-digestion of bagasse spray wastewater and MAW. The results found that biogas yield and methane content was severely affected and total number of bacteria was decreased by about 35% compared to fermentation of bagasse spraying wastewater alone (Shen et al., 2013). Results of the present study showed that the number of main OTUs did not differ much among tanks with different ratios of PM to MAW, only the proportion is different, and the total biogas yield of tanks with mixed PM and MAW was higher than that of tank with PM alone. This suggests that PM is a good candidate for co-digestion with MAW. In future studies, fermentation parameters need to be further adjusted to improve the fermentation effect of MAW, and some microbial populations should be domesticated according to the characteristics of microbial communities. In addition, mid-scale fermentation should be carried out."
10,Conclusions,"This study show that appropriate proportion of PM can facilitate anaerobic treating MAW, and the optimal COD ratio of PM:MAW is 1.0:1.5. Results of microbial community analysis showed that the type of main OTUs did not differ much among tanks with different ratios of PM to MAW. Only the proportion is different. These suggest that PM can promote the biogas production and reduce the toxicity of MAW to microbiology and is a good candidate for co-digestion with MAW."
