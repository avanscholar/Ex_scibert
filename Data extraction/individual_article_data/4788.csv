0,Introduction,"Extensive studies over the past few decades have demonstrated that the size and shape of a catalyst particle on the nanoscale profoundly affect its reaction performance. In particular, controlling the catalyst particle morphology allows a selective exposure of reactive facets with desirable surface coordination, on which the active sites can be enriched and tuned [1–4]. Copper is a cheap alternative to noble metals with a broad range of potential and industrial applications in catalysis [5]. Therefore, investigating its morphology-dependent effect is of great scientific importance and also of industrial interest. Zou et al. demonstrated that Cu cubes displayed a higher TOF than the Cu polyhedrons for p-nitrophenol reduction [6]. Very recently, Li et al. reported crystal plane-dependent stereoselectivity changes in deoxygenation reactions of aromatic epoxides over charcoal-supported copper nanocrystals [7]. Nevertheless, up to now, the research for copper aiming at morphology-dependent effect is scarce compared to that for noble metals. This is probably because metal Cu nanocrystal is much easier to be oxidized or deformed, so it is difficult to remove the usually present surfactants, which induced and stabilized the anisotropic morphologies in synthesis procedure, but blocked the surface of the obtained Cu, thus limiting its catalytic applications. Selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, generally catalyzed by Cu-based catalysts, is an important reaction step for the conversion of hemi-cellulosic materials to biofuels and the production of a great number of derivative chemicals [8]. Although the catalytic performance of Cu-based catalysts for furfural hydrogenation has been extensively studied over copper chromite [9–11], Cu/SiO2 [12], CuZnCrZr [13], CuMgAl [14,15], etc., the morphology-dependent effect of copper has not been involved. Accordingly, in this work, we conducted morphology-controlled synthesis of four different Cu nanocrystals with or without surfactants and tested their catalytic performance to gain insight into the morphology-dependent effect of non-supported copper nanocrystals on furfural hydrogenation."
1,Experimental,
2,Cu materials preparation,"2.1 Cu materials preparation Four copper materials with different shapes were prepared by solution phase reduction. The copper nanowire and nanodisk (denoted as CuNW-EDA and CuND-EDA, respectively) were synthesized at the presence of ethylenediamine (EDA) referenced to previous reports [16,17] except for some changes of copper source and reducing conditions. In a typical synthesis of CuNW-EDA, Cu(CH3COO)2 (4ml, 0.1M), glucose (144mg), NaOH (80ml, 15M) and EDA (0.6ml) were fully mixed, the mixture was then transferred into an autoclave and heated at 393K for 2h. Upon cooling, the product was thoroughly washed with water and ethanol, centrifuged, vacuum desiccated, and finally collected. CuND-EDA was synthesized in a similar procedure as CuNW-EDA, except that EDA added was 4ml and reduction temperature was 333K. For comparison, the copper particle was synthesized at the absence of EDA under a reduction temperature of 333K, which was denoted as CuNP. Another copper nanowire (denoted as CuNW-HDA) was synthesized at the presence of hexadecylamine (HDA) completely according to Xia's previous report [18]."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Nitrogen physisorption, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, XRD and FTIR were conducted to characterize the as-prepared Cu, the experimental details were shown in the Supplementary Information."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The liquid-phase furfural hydrogenation was carried out in an 80ml autoclave with a magnetic stirrer. The mass transfer limitation was eliminated when an agitating speed of 1000rpm was used. 1, 4-dioxane, instead of alcohols, was added as solvent so as to avoid the influence of hydrogen transfer. In addition, n-tetradecane was added as inert internal standard for quantitative analysis. In a typical reaction, 1.0ml of furfural, 20.0ml of 1, 4-dioxane, 0.2ml of n-tetradecane and 0.05g of Cu catalyst were charged into the reactor, which was flushed with N2 and further pressurized with H2 to the desired pressure (1.2–6.0MPa). Then the reaction temperature was raised to the desired value (473–493K) and agitation was started. After different reaction periods (0.25–1.5h), the products were analyzed by an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionizing detector (FID) and a HP Innowax capillary column. The conversion of furfural and the selectivity of products were calculated on the basis of the mass balance of carbon using n-tetradecane as internal standard. In some reactions, the as-prepared Cu catalyst was in-situ reduced at 533K for 1h by H2 at the presence of 1, 4-dioxane. All experiments were conducted in triplicate for reproducibility of the data and the results were within an error of ±5%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of as-prepared Cu,"3.1 Characterization of as-prepared Cu Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 show the SEM images of four as-prepared Cu materials. The CuNP without surfactant exhibited nearly spherical or irregular morphology with an average diameter of about 330nm, while the CuNW-EDA consisted of the predominant nanowires with a diameter of 60–120nm and a length of 6–10μm and a small amount of spherical nanoparticles attached to one end of the nanowires, which was consistent with Wiley's previous report [17]. The CuND-EDA (Fig. S1) exhibited disklike or platelike morphology with a diameter of 0.5–2μm and a thickness of 30–40nm. Some tapered nanocrystals with pentagonal bipyramid structure could also be observed among the CuNW-HDA nanowires (Fig. S1). The BET specific surface areas of copper nanocrystals are listed in Table S1. These values are close to the statistic calculations based on the morphology and size from SEM observation. The XRD patterns of four as-prepared Cu materials (shown in Fig. S2) exhibited nearly identical peaks at 43.3, 50.4 and 74.1°, which could be indexed to {111}, {200}, and {220} diffractions of face-centered cubic Cu (PDF2 No. 04-0836), respectively. No other diffraction peaks corresponding to CuO2, CuO or Cu(OH)2 could be observed, suggesting almost complete reduction of Cu species. Briefly, four metal Cu materials with different shapes were successfully prepared."
7,Furfural hydrogenation reaction,"3.2 Furfural hydrogenation reaction Generally, furfural hydrogenation can lead to a complex reaction network, producing many hydrogenation species such as furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, furan, tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol [13]. In all of our experiments, only two kinds of hydrogenation products formed. Furfuryl alcohol was the major product with a selectivity of 86–96%, while 2-methylfuran was the minor product originated from secondary hydrogenation. This product distribution was in agreement with previous observation on Cu/SiO2 [12]. The selectivity to 2-methylfuran was usually <4% and could be slightly increased with the rise of temperature and the extension of reaction period. And the mass balance, in all runs discussed here, was at the range of 89–98% probably owing to the formation of condensed resin, which could not be detected by GC. As shown in Fig. 2 , the nanowire CuNW-EDA exhibited higher furfural conversion than the other three Cu materials at 473K. When the H2 pressure was raised from 1.2 to 3.0MPa, furfural conversion was increased from 22 to 38% over CuNW-EDA. Continued to raise H2 pressure to 6.0MPa, furfural conversion retained unchanged, indicating a zero reaction order for H2 under high pressures more than 3.0MPa. Further tests showed that the reaction under H2 pressure of 3.0MPa roughly followed pseudo first order kinetics for furfural (Fig. S3). According to the previous report, the CuNW-EDA should grow along 〈110〉 directions and have a circular cross-section [16,17,19], and the nanodisk CuND-EDA also had 〈110〉 orientations [16], while the CuNW-HDA was five-fold twinned pentagonal nanowire with predominantly exposed {100} planes [18]. The spherical CuNP most likely exposed {111} planes due to the request of the lowest surface energy. Comprehensively considering the morphological features, specific surface areas and hydrogenation performances, it is clear that the nanowire CuNW-EDA with specific surface area of 6.55m2 g−1 showed higher activity than the nanodisk CuND-EDA with higher specific surface area of 8.87m2 g−1, although they had the same growing orientations except for the difference of aspect ratios. It seems like morphology-dependent effect (e.g., the ratio of lateral surface and end surface) resulted in the activity variation against the total specific surface areas. However, this requires further validation to rule out other reasons. Additionally, the {111}-exposed CuNP with relatively low specific surface area (2.39m2 g−1) showed slightly higher activity than the {100}-exposed CuNW-HDA (3.72m2 g−1), whereas studies have shown that the {100} planes with higher surface energy are more reactive than the {111} planes [6]. Obviously, morphology-dependent effect could not explain this phenomenon, thus it also requires further investigation."
8,Effect of surfactant residue,"3.3 Effect of surfactant residue Surfactants, also called capping agents or ligands, are frequently used in colloidal synthesis to inhibit nanoparticle overgrowth and aggregation as well as to control the structural characteristics. The adverse and/or favorable influences of the residual surfactants emerged in different catalytic applications [20]. So we conducted FTIR to explore the effect of residual surfactants, as shown in Fig. 3 , which offer another insight for explaining the activity divergence. Both EDA and HDA presented the bands at around 1600cm−1 attributed to NH in-plane bending vibrations, while HDA presented much stronger absorption than EDA at around 2930 and 2850cm−1 corresponding to CH2 − due to longer carbon chain in HDA. The NH absorption at around 1600cm−1 appeared in both CuND-EDA and CuNW-HDA, suggesting the surfactant residue in the two copper nanocrystals. Instead, no NH absorption appeared in CuNW-EDA and CuNP. Considering the difference of synthetic procedures, these observations were quite reasonable. The dosage of EDA used in CuNW-EDA synthesis was much lower than that used in CuND-EDA synthesis, so it was easy to be removed. Actually, repeatedly washing CuNW-EDA for six times could completely remove the residual EDA, whereas repeatedly washing CuND-EDA more than twenty times could not obtain the clean surface yet. For CuNW-HDA, extensive washing would result in morphological changes, so partial HDA had to be retained. Therefore, the lower activity of CuND-EDA and CuNW-HDA mentioned above should be attributed to the effect of the residual surfactants, which probably restricted the adsorption of reactants. Both EDA and HDA over copper surfaces were adverse for furfural hydrogenation. The subsequent discussion would focus on CuNW-EDA and CuNP with clean surfaces."
9,Effect of surface oxidation,"3.4 Effect of surface oxidation The active center for furfural hydrogenation over Cu-based catalysts remains controversial up to now. It is uncertain that Cu0, Cu+1 or both of them are responsible for furfural hydrogenation [9–11]. Because metal Cu nanocrystal is easy to be oxidized in storage or transfer, it is possible that different Cu+1/Cu0 would be presented over the different nanocrystals, which might also lead to different catalytic activities. Thus the effect of surface oxidation on furfural hydrogenation should be considered. Fig. 4 shows the HRTEM image of CuNW-EDA. The fringes with lattice spacing of 0.21 and 0.18nm could be indexed to the {111} and {200} planes of Cu, while the fringes with lattice spacing of 0.25 and 0.30nm could be indexed to the {111} and {110} planes of Cu2O, indicating the existence of Cu2O on the surface of Cu nanowires. This was also confirmed by the FT images (Fig. S4). It should be noted that these thin Cu2O layers could not be observed by XRD because the crystallites were too small beyond XRD detection limit. Similarly, as shown in Fig. S5, the HRTEM investigation on CuNP identified the existence of Cu2O on the surface of Cu particles as well. However, the difference of surface oxidation between CuNW-EDA and CuNP could not be distinguished. Unexpectedly, the comparison of hydrogenation performances between untreated Cu nanocrystals and pre-reduced ones suggested that the surface oxidation had no influence on furfural hydrogenation. As shown in Table 1 , after a reaction period of 0.5h at 473K, the furfural conversions were 14.5 and 14.7%, 1.98 and 1.91% over untreated and in-situ pre-reduced CuNW-EDA or CuNP, respectively. Actually, in the whole reaction process, their activities before and after pre-reduction remained almost unchanged, suggesting that the Cu2O on the surface of the untreated Cu materials should be readily reduced to metal Cu at the initial reaction period. Therefore the Cu+1 species on the as-prepared catalyst surface is probably not responsible for furfural hydrogenation, but the Cu0 species presented on the as-prepared catalyst surface or originated from the reduction of the Cu+1 species at initial reaction stage acts as the active center for furfural hydrogenation."
10,Morphology-dependent effect,"3.5 Morphology-dependent effect After ruling out the effect of residue surfactants and surface oxidation, the intrinsic activity of Cu surface atom over CuNW-EDA and CuNP could be compared. As shown in Table 1, the initial reaction rate of CuNW-EDA was 0.092molg−1 h−1, much higher than that of CuNP (0.012molg−1 h−1). In fact, this activity difference contained the contribution of different numbers of active sites, i.e. different surface areas were involved in it. So turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated to describe the activity of a single site. Two kinds of TOF were obtained based on the surface Cu atom numbers from BET measurement and chemisorption, respectively. No matter which calculation method was used, each TOF value of the nanowire CuNW-EDA was about three times higher than that of the particle CuNP, as shown in Table 1, definitely suggesting a significant morphology-dependent effect of Cu in furfural hydrogenation. Moreover, apparent activation energies for CuNP and CuNW-EDA were estimated at 473–493K, and the corresponding Arrhenius plots were shown in Fig. 5 . As expected, the highly reactive CuNW-EDA presented a lower Ea, 41.0kJmol−1, while CuNP had a higher one, 66.9kJmol−1. These Ea values were close to those previously reported over Cu-based catalysts for furfural hydrogenation, e.g., 11±2kcalmol−1 over copper chromite [9], 11.8kcalmol−1 over Cu/SiO2 [12] and 66kJmol−1 over CuMgAl [15]."
11,Conclusions,"Four metal Cu materials with different shapes were prepared to explore the morphology-dependent effect of Cu on furfural hydrogenation. The copper nanowire derived from ethylenediamine-assisted synthesis exhibited much higher activity than the spherical particle, suggesting a significant morphology-dependent effect. Furthermore, the residual surfactants, EDA and HDA, both restricted the adsorption of reactants over copper surface and were adverse for furfural hydrogenation. The surface oxidation of as-prepared Cu had no influence on the catalytic performance because the Cu2O on the surface of the untreated Cu materials would be reduced to metal Cu under the reaction conditions."
