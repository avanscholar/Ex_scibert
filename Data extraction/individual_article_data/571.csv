0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is one of the ideal chemicals for solar fuel [1–3], has been widely applied for biological process, organic synthesis, chemical industry and environmental remediation [4]. H2O2 is considered as an environmentally friendly reagent since its decomposition produces only H2O and O2 which is very efficient for energy store and transport [5,6]. Nowadays, many techniques are used for H2O2 production including the anthraquinone method [7], direct synthesis of H2O2 with H2 and O2 [8], electrochemical synthesis [9] and alcohols oxidation method [10]. However, these methods have two shortcomings: 1) large amounts of energy and organic solvents have been consumed; 2) organic impurities may contaminate the formed H2O2 and increase the difficulty of extraction. Therefore, an efficient, energy-saving and green method to produce H2O2 is highly desired. The photocatalytic H2O2 production through proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) can meet the above requirement because it needs only H2O, O2 and light [11]. In general, the experiments are performed at O2-equilibrated solution with a catalyst by illumination when alcohols used as electron donor [12]. As a result, the photogenerated electrons (e−) on the conduction band (CB) can reduce O2 to H2O2 (Eq. (1)); while the photogenerated holes (h+) can oxidize the alcohols to aldehyde and hydrogen ion by-products (Eq. (2)). (1) O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2 (0.68 V vs. NHE) (2) R-CH2OH + 2 h+ → R-CHO + 2H+ It was reported that the TiO2-based photocatalysts exhibit excellent catalytic activity for photocatalytic H2O2 production [13,14]. However, the catalytic activity of pure TiO2 photocatalyst is impeded due to the fast charge recombination and the decomposition of formed H2O2. In order to enhance the catalytic activity of TiO2-based catalyst for photocatalytic H2O2 production, surface modification is needed to improve the photogenerated charges separation and stable the formed H2O2. Efficient modified-TiO2 can be obtained via different approaches including metal and non-metal doping, impurity loading, coupling with other semiconductors or oxides, polymer coating and dye-sensitization [15]. Polyoxometalates (POMs), as a category of compounds formed by the oxygenation of a front transition metal ion, have exhibited enormous potential in many areas due to their good photo-chemical activity resulting from HOMO-LUMO transition [16]. MOx group (MV, W, Nb, Ta; x = 5, 6), that exhibits a high oxidation valence, is the staple structure archetype in various structural polyanion clusters [17]. The charge transfer from O2− to Mn+ (n = 5, 6) caused by the photoexcitation of POMs can result in the generation of electron (M(n−1)+) and hole (O−) pairs under illumination with a sufficient energy. Additionally, the reasons for excellent catalytic activity of POMs can boil down to the following factors: 1) the large absorption of light because of their high molecular absorption modulus (ε >1 × 104 M−1 L−1); 2) the high separation of electron and hole pairs due to the suitable energy level structure of POMs [18]; and 3) the catalytic and physical stability of POMs clusters which allow a continuous photocatalytic redox species production [17]. Based on these, POMs could be the ideal guest molecules for TiO2 host. The combination of POMs and TiO2 via simple ligand-receptor binding or electrostatic interaction can lead to the POMs leaching [19]. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop covalent combination of POMs and TiO2 to enhance the interaction between them. Herein, the POMs cluster of [PW9O34]9− (PW9) have been covalently immobilized onto anatase TiO2 surface to prepare the catalyst of TiO2-PW9. The photocatalytic H2O2 production has been carried out over TiO2-PW9 under full wavelength irradiation in the presence of 5 vol.% benzyl alcohol as electron donor. The catalytic results reveal that the amounts of H2O2 can reach 38.2, 6.6, 22.8 and 18.7 μmol within 2 h for TiO2-PW9, Na-PW9, TiO2-PW9-PM (physically mixed) and bare TiO2, respectively. The p-benzoquinone (PBQ) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) quenching experiments, the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal and quantitative experiment of superoxide radicals ( O2-) results reveal that the negative shifts of the CB level from TiO2 to TiO2-PW9 (from −0.18 V to −0.36 V vs. NHE) can enhance the single-electron reduction of O2 to O2- and further promote the sequential two-step single-electron O2 reduction reaction to H2O2. In addition, the recycle experiment results reveal that the heterogeneous TiO2-PW9 is catalytic stable."

2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt%), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), p-benzoquinone (PBQ) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), 5-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (BMPO, 99.0%) and benzyl alcohol (C7H8O) were purchased from Alfa Asear, DOJINDO and Aladdin Chemistry Co. Ltd., respectively. All chemicals were analytical grade. All solutions were prepared with ultrapure water. Na8H[β-A-PW9O34]⋅24 H2O was synthesized and characterized according to previous reports [20,21]."
3,Preparation and characterization of TiO2-PW9,"2.2 Preparation and characterization of TiO2-PW9 The TiO2-PW9 photocatalyst was synthesized according to the previously reported method [22,23] with a slight modification. In a typical experiment, a mixture of ethanol (25 mL) and tetrabutyl titanate (10 mL) was added to 100 mL of ultrapure water under agitation. Next, 50 mL of 1.25 M NaHCO3 solution was added dropwise to the previous solution. The obtained mixture was put in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and treated at 180 °C for 48 h. After the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature naturally, the obtained white precipitation was filtered and washed with ultrapure water for 30 min and dried for 12 h under vacuum at 60 °C. The obtained white TiO2 powder was well grinded and reserved. Afterwards, 1 g of Na8H[β-A-PW9O34]⋅24 H2O was dissolved into 30 mL of ultrapure water, followed by addition of 1 g TiO2 powder under stirring. Then, 1 M HCl was added dropwise to the mixture to adjust the pH at 1. The obtained mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and then put in a stainless steel autoclave at 180 °C for 24 h. Finally, the obtained TiO2-PW9 photocatalyst was washed with ultrapure water for 30 min, and dried for 12 h under vacuum at 60 °C. The PW9 in TiO2-PW9 hybrids was analyzed by ICP-AES which showed that the PW9 weight percentage was 14.30 wt%. Solid state NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker Avance 300 M solid state spectrometer equipped with a commercial 5 mm MAS NMR probe. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on an X’Pert PRO MPD system equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15405 nm, 40 kV and 40 mA). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements were carried out on a Nicolet 5700 spectrometer with attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode. The X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy (XPS) was measured using a Phi Quantern instrument. The binding energies were calibrated with C 1s = 284.8 eV. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope at 200 kV. Field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi SU-8010. The N2 adsorption-desorption experiments were carried out on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument working at −196 °C. UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) were carried out using a spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. Ion chromatography (IC) was performed on a Dionex ICS-1500 equipment. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was measured using a Shimadzu ICPS-7500 instrument. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out on a Shimadzu LC-20AT equipped with a C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm ×5 μm) reversed-phase column and a UV detector. Gas chromatography (GC) was performed on an Agilent 7890A equipped with FID and TCD detectors."
4,Photocatalytic activity assessment,"2.3 Photocatalytic activity assessment TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 as-prepared photocatalysts were used for the photocatalytic production of H2O2 under full-wavelength illumination. Photocatalytic experiments were performed in a 120 mL of square quartz reactor using a light source of PLS-SXE300 Xenon lamp (Perfect Light Company, Beijing) with the wattage of 300 W at wavelength range of 200–1100 nm. For each photocatalytic reaction, 100 mg of photocatalyst was mixed with 100 mL of reaction solution, in which, the volume ratio of benzyl alcohol to water is 5/95. Before light irradiation, reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h to establish the adsorption-desorption equilibrium of dissolved oxygen and benzyl alcohol on the surface of photocatalyst. At regular time intervals, aliquots (2 mL) was taken from the reaction mixture and the photocatalyst was removed by filtration. The concentration of produced H2O2 was analysed by iodine titration [24]. At the end of the photocatalytic reaction, the photocatalyst suspension was recovered and washed with ultrapure water for 30 min at room temperature and dried for 12 h under 60 °C vacuum, and then it was recycled for four times. The H2O2 solution can be obtained from the reaction mixture by liquid separation after the catalyst removed [25]. To check the decomposition of H2O2 decomposition behavior over TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 photocatalysts, 100 mg of photocatalyst and 100 mL of H2O2 solution at 1 mM was stirred under full-wavelength illumination, and the concentration of H2O2 was followed."
5,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements The photoelectrochemical experiments were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) with a conventional three-electrode system, in which saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and Pt wire (80 mm in length with a 1.5 mm diameter) were chosen as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The working electrode was fabricated by immobilizing catalysts on the FTO conductive glass by a casting method. Briefly, the as-prepared catalysts (10 mg) were added into the blend containing 0.8 mL of ethanol and 0.2 mL of 5% Nafion solution. The suspension was sonicated for 3 h to reach the uniform. Subsequently, the suspension was added dropwise on FTO glass and dried at 25 °C for 24 h. The electrolyte was 50 mM Na2SO4 aqueous solution. During photoelectrochemical testing, the reverse side of film electrode was illumined using the Xe lamp."
6,O2 − radical examination,"2.5 O2 − radical examination The role of O2 − radical was investigated by using the PBQ as a quencher (k = 0.9–1.0 × 109 M−1 s−1) [26–28]. For this, 11 mg of PBQ was added to the photocatalytic reaction experiment to quench the photoproduced O2 − species. ESR signals were obtained on a Bruker model ESR A300-10/12 spectrometer with Microwave Bridge. BMPO was chosen as the capture agent of O2 − radical. Typically, 20 μL of suspension was taken out from container, and then added into 20 μL of 25 mM BMPO immediately. Because NBT can react with O2 − radical and generated purple formazan, which is undissolved in water [29]. NBT was employed as the O2 − radical scavenger to quantify the concentration of O2 −. During the photocatalytic reaction, 100 mg of catalyst was dispersed into the vessel with 100 mL of benzyl alcohol/water mixture (the volume ratio is 5/95) containing 0.02 mM NBT and illumined by Xe lamp. At given time intervals, the O2 − concentration was conducted by detecting the absorbance change of NBT at 259 nm wavelength."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of TiO2-PW9 composite photocatalyst,"3.1 Characterization of TiO2-PW9 composite photocatalyst POMs clusters can be used as ligands for Ti4+ ions that covalently linked to single-crystal anatase cores [23]. Numerous Ti4+-substituted tri-lacunary POMs (PW9) capping ligands (Eq. (3)),[PW9O34Ti]-O−, are covalently combined with anatase-TiO2 cores, resulting in TiO2-PW9 hybrids. The covalent combination of POMs clusters of PW9 and TiO2 was validated by solid-state NMR. The 31P NMR spectra for Na-PW9 and TiO2-PW9 are shown in Fig. 1 . The linewidths of the peak in these two spectra are very narrow, comparable to those found in the ordinary liquid samples. For the same phosphorus precursor, the shape of the spectra does not change with the composition of the samples. The signals assigned to the phosphorus atoms can both be observed at δ = -10.8 and -13.1 ppm. These peaks are assigned to [PW9O34]9- and formed [PTiW9O35]7- capping ligands, respectively. The negative shift and dropped intensity for the resonance peak from Na-PW9 to TiO2-PW9 may probably due to the existence of electronegative substituent in TiO2-PW9, which confirms the reaction between PW9 clusters and TiO2 surface. The similar signals of the 31P NMR for Na-PW9 and TiO2-PW9 indicate that the PW9 clusters were covalently immobilized onto the TiO2 surface and the shell construction of PW9 clusters were maintained as well [23]. As shown in Fig. 1, the small resonance at around -12.6 ppm disappeared after the TiO2-PW9 has been ultrasonicated for 30 min. The above results reveal that the small resonance at around -12.6 ppm is suggested as the phosphorus-containing impurities that adsorbed on the TiO2-PW9 surface.

The typical diffraction peaks situated at 2θ equal to 25.39°, 37.16°, 37.94°, 38.63°, 48.13°, 54.06°, 55.17°, 62.34°, 62.91°, 68.90°, 70.40° and 75.15° are assigned to the (101), (103), (004), (112), (200), (105), (211), (213), (204), (116), (220) and (215) reflections of anatase TiO2, respectively. For the TiO2-PW9 composite, the XRD pattern is similar to that of bare TiO2, indicating that Na8H[β-A-PW9O34]⋅24 H2O has no obvious diffraction, owing to the weak crystallinity caused by coexisting with other crystals [19]. The modification of TiO2 with PW9 clusters can retard the crystallization and increase the framework connectivity, giving rise to enhanced stability and mechanical resilience of TiO2-PW9 composite. The IR spectra for TiO2, Na-PW9 and TiO2-PW9 are shown in Fig. 2b. The vibrations within the scope of 600-850 cm−1 can be found in both TiO2 and TiO2-PW9, which are attributed to the Ti-O-Ti chemical bonds. In addition, the wide peak at approximately 3500 cm−1 is primarily attributed to the −OH stretching vibrations caused by water molecules adsorbed from atmosphere. The vibrations of WOW, WO, and PO chemical bonds in the tri-lacunary POM of Na-PW9 can be observed at 883, 931, and 1056 cm−1, respectively [30]. It can be seen that there was no stretching vibrations for WOW, and WO in IR spectrum of TiO2-PW9, because of the fact that the vibrations usually appear below 1100 cm−1 while the TiO2 has intensive infrared absorption in this region [31]. The XPS characterization was conducted to determine the external elemental ingredient and the corresponding valence states in as-prepared TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 samples. Fig. 3 a shows the XPS peaks of Ti 2p for TiO2 and TiO2-PW9. The two peaks corresponded to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 can be observed at binding energies of about 464.1 and 458.4 eV, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3b, both the Na-PW9 and TiO2-PW9 show one P 2p XPS peak at 133.6 eV, indicating the PW9 clusters have been immobilized onto the TiO2 surface. Fig. 3c shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of W 4f for Na-PW9 and TiO2-PW9 powders. The binding energies of W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2 are equal to 37.6 eV and 35.5 eV, respectively, which are identical to the W(VI) oxidation state [19]. In addition, the O 1s XPS peak of TiO2-PW9 (Fig. 3d) can be split into two peaks at 530.7 eV and 530.0 eV, corresponding to external water molecules and lattice oxygen atoms, respectively. The XPS results indicate that the PW9 clusters have been immobilized onto the TiO2 surface. The morphology and microstructure of as-prepared TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 were investigated by SEM and HRTEM analysis. HRTEM images of pristine TiO2 sample (Fig. 4 a and c) show the ellipsoidal nanoparticles with average size of 20–50 nm. However, almost no PW9 clusters can be apparently found in TiO2-PW9 sample (Fig. 4b and d), which may probably due to the well distribution of the PW9 clusters onto TiO2 surface [32]. The lattice fringes can be observed in both TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 as depicted in Fig. 4e and f, respectively, which are assigned to the (101) planes of anatase TiO2. SEM-mapping characterization was performed to investigate the dispersion of PW9 clusters on TiO2. As shown in Fig. 5 a and b, the granular conformation of TiO2-PW9 was observed in SEM image. Furthermore, the EDX mappings of Ti, O, P, and W confirm that the PW9 clusters are well distributed onto TiO2 surface via covalent combination. To evaluate the porosity characteristic and surface area of as-prepared catalysts, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution curves characterization were carried out. According to IUPAC classification, the isotherms for TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 (Fig. 6 a) are identical to type IV isotherm possessed a H3-type hysteresis loop, suggesting the mesoporous property in both samples. The pore size distribution curves for TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 (Fig. 6b) based on the isotherms exhibit pore sizes of 15.88 and 11.42 nm, respectively. The sharper particle distribution and lower pore diameter caused by the introduction of PW9 can result in more uniform morphology and larger surface area. In addition, BET measurements show that the surface area of TiO2-PW9 is 128 m2 g−1, which is larger than that of the bare TiO2 (103 m2 g−1). The mesoporosity and large surface area characteristics for TiO2-PW9 nanoparticles would promote the enhancement of photocatalytic performance by exposing more active sites."
9,Photocatalytic performance of TiO2-PW9,"3.2 Photocatalytic performance of TiO2-PW9 The photocatalytic H2O2 production on different catalysts was performed in the presence of 5 vol.% benzyl alcohol under full-wavelength illumination at 25 °C in an O2-equilibrated conditions. In the dark, the adsorption balance processes were accomplished by stirring the suspension in the presence of oxygen for 1 h. No H2O2 was generated over any catalyst in dark. Afterwards, the light irradiation was turned on to initiate the photocatalytic reaction. As shown in Fig. 7 a, the H2O2 can be rapidly produced over TiO2-PW9, wherein, the generated H2O2 quantity reached 38.2 μmol under irradiation within 2 h. The H2O2 yield over TiO2-PW9 is larger than that of bare TiO2 (18.7 μmol in 2 h) or Na-PW9 (6.6 μmol in 2 h). For comparison, the activity of TiO2-PW9-PM obtained via the physical mixture of TiO2 and PW9 was investigated. The physically mixed TiO2-PW9-PM shows a lower catalytic performance (22.8 μmol in 2 h) than that of TiO2-PW9. While in the absence of catalyst, the H2O2 yield was only 2.9 μmol within 2 h. In addition, the H2O2 formation rates of TiO2-PW9, TiO2-PW9-PM, TiO2 and Na-PW9 were calculated to be 19.1, 11.4, 9.4 and 3.3 μmol h−1, respectively. It is important to point out that the production and decomposition of H2O2 can take place simultaneously in the photocatalytic system which is due to the thermodynamic instability of H2O2 in the presence of catalysts [33]. Therefore, we estimated the rate constants of photocatalytic H2O2 production and decomposition using the following kinetic calculation formula (Eq. (4)) [34]: (4) H 2 O 2 = K f K d 1 − e k d t The Kf is production rate constant and the Kd is decomposition rate constant, which can be calculated by data fitting. When the PW9 clusters are covalently immobilized onto the TiO2 surface, as exhibited in Fig. 7b, Kf value increases from 0.2923 to 0.5142 μM min−1 and Kd value reduces from 0.0119 to 0.0089 min−1. Such consequences reveal that the TiO2-PW9 composite catalyst facilitates the photocatalytic H2O2 production and inhibits the decomposition of generated H2O2 under light irradiation, which is attributed to the increased light absorption and improved charge carrier transport caused by PW9 clusters. Previous studies reported that H2O2 could be decomposed to H2O and O2 under light irradiation (H2O2 → H2O + O2) [35]. The H2O2 decomposition behavior over various catalysts was investigated by a series of the photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition experiments. Fig. 8 a shows that the H2O2 decomposition rate was about 15% over TiO2-PW9 within 1 h, against 88% for bare TiO2, 63% for TiO2-PW9-PM and 29% for Na-PW9. However, 43% of H2O2 were decomposed when there is no catalyst. Such consequences reveal that the introduction of Na-PW9 can inhibit H2O2 decomposition. Therefore, the formed H2O2 in the TiO2-PW9 system is more stable than that in the TiO2 system, suggesting that PW9 clusters tethered on TiO2 is more suitable for photocatalytic H2O2 production. Due to the constant quantity of the catalysts and the large amounts of H2O2 (1 mM), it is expected that the decomposition will follow a pseudo-first-order kinetics reaction: (5) − d c t d t = k 0 where Ct and C0 are the H2O2 concentration at time t and the initial concentration of H2O2, respectively, k is the pseudo-first-order rate constant. In order to estimate the rate constant more accurately, the H2O2 decomposition data over different catalysts was fitted according to Eq. (5) and showed in Fig. 8b. The results indicate that the calculated k values were in the following order: TiO2-PW9 (0.0027 min−1) < Na-PW9 (0.0055 min−1) < None (0.0086 min−1) < TiO2-PW9-PM (0.0178 min−1) < TiO2 (0.0335 min−1). Such results prove that the PW9 clusters covalently immobilized onto the TiO2 surface can effectively inhibit the decomposition of generated H2O2 under illumination. It is worth noting that the function of O2 in photocatalytic H2O2 production process is very important. Therefore, the photocatalytic H2O2 production on TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 were carried out under O2-equilibrated and N2-equilibrated conditions in order to address the importance of dissolved oxygen (Fig. 9 ). In general, the protons can react with the electrons in the absence of O2, but the photoexcited electrons can be eliminated when there is oxygen in the system [36]. Control experiment results showed that there was no H2O2 production under N2-equilibrated conditions, indicating that the photocatalytic H2O2 production is accomplished by the O2 reduction reaction. An additional concern is the role of benzyl alcohol in the system. Figure shows the photocatalytic H2O2 production under different benzyl alcohol additions over TiO2-PW9. When there is no benzyl alcohol, the H2O2 can also be produced, wherein, the generated H2O2 quantity was found to be 13.5 μmol within 2 h, which confirms the sole requirement for O2, H2O and light. The H2O2 yield increases with the increasing of benzyl alcohol concentration. At a concentration of 5 vol.% of benzyl alcohol, the H2O2 production achieves maximized and the reaction rate is the fastest. Because benzyl alcohol is a quencher of hole and can promote the photogenerated electrons production, which is beneficial to O2 reduction process. Table shows the Product analysis of benzyl alcohol, a portion of benzyl alcohol in system was oxidized to benzaldehyde, benzoic acid and carbon dioxide. Table 1 summarizes the photocatalytic H2O2 production rates over different TiO2-based catalysts. The H2O2 formation rate over TiO2-PW9 (19.1 μmol h−1) is more than those over F-TiO2 (<0.2 μmol h−1) [37], N-TiO2 (<0.2 μmol h−1) [37], TiO2-CoPi-rGOs (2.7 μmol h−1) [12] and BM‐Au/TiO2‐CO3 2− (10.0 μmol h−1) [24], but inferior to that over Au/TiO2 (43.8 μmol h−1) [14]. However, the use of noble metals for the synthesis of photocatalysts for water remediation is not recommended due to their high cost. Moreover, the H2O2 formation rate over TiO2-PW9 is also more than that over Cv-g-C3N4 (9.2 μmol h−1) [44]. T. P. Fellinger et al. have reported that the electrocatalytic synthesis H2O2 production rate over meso-BMP-800 can reach 98.0 μmol h−1 [38], which is much higher than that over TiO2-PW9 through photocatalytic H2O2 production. However, the process of the electrocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 over meso-BMP-800 is energy-consumed. Early reported biological processes, such as cellular metabolism [39] and protein glycation [40], produce only a few nanomolar levels of H2O2. The anthraquinone method has been commercialized for many years and accounts for around 95% of the global H2O2 production [7]. However, the anthraquinone method utilized in industry catalyzed by Pd-based catalysts requires the regeneration of anthrahydroquinone by H2. The H2O2 formation rate over Au-Pd/Carbon can reach 1.1 mol·h−1 for the direct synthesis of H2O2 with H2 and O2 [8]. However, the direct synthesis of H2O2 with H2 and O2 should pay more attention to the potentially explosive nature of H2/O2 mixed gases. Therefore, the noble metal-free photocatalytic H2O2 production from H2O and O2 is highly desired; the relatively high H2O2 formation rate among the reported photocatalysts makes TiO2-PW9 a promising catalyst for photocatalytic H2O2 production."
10,Structure-property correlation of TiO2-PW9,"3.3 Structure-property correlation of TiO2-PW9 The working electrodes of three-electrode electrochemical system were manufactured by casting the samples of TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses using a previously reported method [41]. As can be seen from Fig. 10 a, the photo-current responses of TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 are 0.09 and 0.36 μA cm−2, respectively. The three times enhanced current density observed in TiO2-PW9 indicates that the mobility of the charge carriers is effectively enhanced. Meanwhile, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots of different catalysts were performed to investigate the interfacial charge transfer, and the results are presented in Fig. 10b. The radius of Nyquist arc for TiO2-PW9 is smaller than that of TiO2, which suggests that the resulting TiO2-PW9 has lower resistances than bare TiO2. The above results reveal that the PW9 clusters can efficaciously elevate the interfacial charge transfer of TiO2. The LSV curves of TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 electrodes were measured in the dark. Fig. 10c shows that the initial potential of TiO2 is approximately at 1.64 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), which is about 0.41 V higher than that of the thermodynamic potential of O2/H2O (1.23 V vs. NHE). Furthermore, current density with a slow increase in bias signifies the high kinetic obstacle. Compared with bare TiO2, the current density of TiO2-PW9 was significantly improved, and the initial potential was also negatively shifted to 1.50 V vs. NHE. The p-benzoquinone (PBQ) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) quenching experiments have been carried out to investigate the role of O2 − in photocatalytic H2O2 production over TiO2 and TiO2-PW9. PBQ has been demonstrated to be an efficient scavenger for O2 − (k = 0.9–1.0 × 109 M-1 s-1) [26–28], and SOD can catalyze the dismutation of O2 − to form H2O2 [42]. As illustrated in Fig. 11 a, the addition of 1 mM PBQ can inhibit the photocatalytic H2O2 production process, while the addition of 1 mM SOD can increase the H2O2 yield. Fig. 11b exhibits the ESR spectra of TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 systems after 5 min illumination. There is no BMPO- O2 − adduct in the presence of PBQ or SOD. In contrast, the typical six-fold peaks assigned to the BMPO- O2 − adduct can be observed in TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 systems, indicating the generation of O2 − in both systems. However, the ESR signal intensity of BMPO- O2 − observed in TiO2-PW9 system is much stronger than that in TiO2 system, implying that much more O2 − radicals were produced in TiO2-PW9 system. To prove this, the concentration of O2 − radical was quantified through the NBT method [29]. Fig. 11c shows the yield of formed O2 − radicals on TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 during the photocatalytic H2O2 production, which confirms the ESR results. The above results reveal that the photocatalytic H2O2 production over TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 are both through the two consecutive steps single-electron O2 reduction reaction to H2O2 (Eq. (6) and (7)) [43,44]. Covalent combination of PW9 clusters and TiO2 can enhance the one-electron reduction of O2 to O2- and further promote the sequential two-step single-electron O2 reduction reaction to H2O2. (6) O2 + e− → O2 − (−0.13 V vs. NHE) (7) O2 − + 2H+ + e− → H2O2 (1.44 V vs. NHE) The Mott-Schottky measurements were performed at different frequencies to investigate the property of the semiconductor and estimate the flat band potentials (Efb) of catalyst casted on FTO. The Mott-Schottky plots of TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 present positive slopes (Fig. 12 a and b), owing to the n-type semiconductor property [45]. In general, the intercept extended linear part of Mott-Schottky curve to X-axis is the flat band potential [46]. The Efb values of TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 are -0.08 V and -0.26 V vs. NHE, respectively. Generally, the flat band potential is more positive than the conduction band level of about 0-0.1 V [3]. Therefore, the conduction band potential (Ecb) for TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 were found to be -0.18 V and -0.36 V vs. NHE, respectively. The Tauc plots of TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 were inferred according to the formula of (F(R)·hν)2 = A(hν-Eg), where the h, ν, and A are the Planck’s constant, frequency, and constant, respectively, the Eg represents the semiconductor band gap (Fig. 13 b). The band gaps of TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 are 3.25 and 3.20 eV, respectively. Narrowing of band gap caused by PW9 gives rise to the TiO2-PW9 can absorb more light. According to the formula of Eg = Evb - Ecb, the calculated valence band potentials (Evb) for TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 were found to be 3.07 V and 2.84 V vs. NHE, respectively. Fig. 13c shows the energy levels and charge transfer pathways of TiO2 and TiO2-PW9. It was found that the value of negative shift for conduction band position from TiO2 to TiO2-PW9 is 0.18 V. The negative shift of conduction band position on TiO2-PW9 is beneficial to facilitate the photogenerated electrons production. Moreover, PW9 can also produce the photogenerated electrons due to its semiconductor property. The charge transfer between different energy level semiconductors inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, which enhances the quantum efficiency. The CB position of TiO2-PW9 is -0.36 V vs. NHE, while the reduction potential of O2/ O2 − is -0.13 V vs. NHE. The adequate potential difference (0.23 V) between them verifies the possibility for photocatalytic reduction of O2 [47]. In short, the negative shift of conduction band position caused by the introduction of PW9 clusters can promote the single-electron O2 reduction process. The reduction of O2 to H2O2 takes place through the two consecutive steps single-electron O2 reduction reaction."
11,Heterogeneity and stability of TiO2-PW9,"3.4 Heterogeneity and stability of TiO2-PW9 The heterogeneous property for photocatalytic H2O2 production over TiO2-PW9 catalyst should be confirmed by a control experiment. After the photocatalytic reaction for 1 h, TiO2-PW9 was removed by filtration from the suspension system, and then the experiment was continued under same conditions. Fig. 14 a shows that no new H2O2 forms and the generated H2O2 starts to break down slowly in the filtrate system. Such results prove that the photocatalytic H2O2 production on TiO2-PW9 catalyst is really heterogeneous. After the filtration of catalyst, there was no P element found and 0.9% (1.0 mg L−1) of W ions were leached in the filtrate. A small amount of W leaching has almost no effect on the structural stability. The lifetime of the system was investigated by extending the reaction time to 10 h. As shown in Fig. 15 , the maximum amounts of generated H2O2 over TiO2 and TiO2-PW9 can reach 45.1 and 108.6 μmol within 10 h, respectively. To investigate the stability of TiO2-PW9 hybrid catalyst, four successive cycle experiments were performed for the photocatalytic H2O2 production under the same conditions. As it can be seen from Fig. 14b, the catalytic activity was almost the same without obvious decrease, while the recovery rate of catalyst can reach 90% after four cycles. The XRD and IR spectra of the fresh and used TiO2-PW9 (Fig. S2) exhibit mostly identical typical peaks. The EDX mappings of the used TiO2-PW9 indicate that the dispersion of PW9 clusters on TiO2 surface is maintained after the photocatalytic reaction. The above results suggest that TiO2-PW9 hybrid catalyst is heterogeneous and catalytically stable."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, in order to enhance the catalytic activity of TiO2-based catalyst for photocatalytic H2O2 production, the POMs cluster of [PW9O34]9− (PW9) have been covalently immobilized onto anatase TiO2 surface to prepare the catalyst of TiO2-PW9. The photocatalytic H2O2 production has been carried out over TiO2-PW9 under full wavelength irradiation in the presence of 5 vol.% benzyl alcohol as electron donor. The catalytic results reveal that the amounts of H2O2 can reach 38.2, 6.6, 22.8 and 18.7 μmol within 2 h for TiO2-PW9, Na-PW9, TiO2-PW9-PM and bare TiO2, respectively. The PBQ and SOD quenching experiments, the ESR signal and quantitative experiment of O2- results reveal that the negative shifts of the CB level from TiO2 to TiO2-PW9 (from -0.18 V to -0.36 V vs. NHE) can enhance the single-electron reduction of O2 to O2- and further promote the sequential two-step single-electron O2 reduction reaction to H2O2. In addition, the recycle experiment results reveal that the heterogeneous TiO2-PW9 is catalytic stable."
