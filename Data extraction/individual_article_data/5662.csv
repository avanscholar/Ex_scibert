0,Introduction,"D-sorbitol is a highly versatile sugar alcohol, which finds application in many different areas such as food additive (low-calories sweetener), cosmetics (moisturizer), drug formulation (excipient) and a wide range of other industrial applications [1]. This versatility has made sorbitol to be listed as one of the updated group of platform molecules useful to tackle the transition of chemical industry from crude oil to biomass as starting feedstock [2]. The global production of sorbitol has been estimated to be more than 500,000 tons per year [3], being the vast majority produced by catalytic hydrogenation of glucose using Raney-type Ni catalysts [4]. These classic hydrogenation catalysts exhibit good catalytic activity and low cost, but also quite low stability, suffering from metal leaching [5]. Besides, some applications for sorbitol (food, medicine, cosmetics, etc.) require nickel traces to be completely removed from the final product, so that costly separation and purification operations are needed. As an alternative to nickel-based catalysts, several active metal phases have been tested for glucose hydrogenation [6], including Pt [7], or Ru [8], or their mixtures [9]. Indeed, ruthenium has been described for long time as one of the most active catalytic phases for glucose hydrogenation [10], and thus, as potential efficient alternative to nickel-based catalysts [5]. The catalytic performance of ruthenium active phases on the hydrogenation of glucose strongly depends on the catalyst support, as it conditions not only the dispersion of the metal phase [11]- [12], but also some other properties, such as its stability or even the selectivity towards the desired reaction product. In this sense, Ru-based catalysts have been prepared with different solid supports, including zeolites [13]- [14], carbon materials [15], polymer resins [16], mesostructured silicas [17–19] or metal oxides [20]. Each type of support depicts advantages and drawbacks. For instance, silica-based materials can be prepared with good textural properties, but they also evidence low stability under hydrothermal conditions, and supported ruthenium suffers from metal sintering [21]. Group IVb metal oxides, such as TiO2, ZrO2 or HfO2 have been extensively used for supporting ruthenium to make hydrogenation catalysts in aqueous phase [22–27]. These materials have shown excellent capability to disperse ruthenium, high resistance against metal poisoning and sintering in aqueous media, and enhanced activity and selectivity of ruthenium in several chemical transformations. However, these metal oxides conventionally exhibit low textural properties. In this context, our group has recently synthesized composite materials comprising zirconia monolayers dispersed throughout SBA-15 architecture, having said materials been tested in different catalytic reactions [28–30]. Within this contribution, we have applied this strategy to combine the excellent textural properties of mesostructured silica with the good features of ZrO2 as metal catalyst support. Such a combination is highly beneficial to get a sort of “large surface area zirconia support”, as the silica-based support is fully covered by zirconia, thus showing the surface properties of ZrO2, while preserving most of the textural properties of SBA-15. These ZrO2-SBA-15 supports have been used for the preparation of ruthenium-containing ZrO2-coated SBA-15 materials, to be used in glucose to sorbitol transformation. The result is highly active and stable catalysts in the aqueous phase hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials D-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5 %) was used as substrate without previous purification. Pluronic triblock copolymer P123 (Aldrich) was used as SBA-15 structure template; tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, Aldrich, 99 %) was used as silica precursor; zirconium (IV) propoxide (Zr (OPr)4 solution 70 wt % in propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as zirconium precursor for the preparation of ZrO2-coated SBA-15 material. Finally, ruthenium chloride (RuCl3·3H2O, Aldrich, 99.98 %) was used as ruthenium metal source."
3,Synthesis of mesoporous supports,"2.2 Synthesis of mesoporous supports SBA-15 material was prepared according to the procedure described in the literature [31]. In a typical synthesis, 4 g of Pluronic P123 were dissolved in 125 mL of an aqueous 1.9 N HCl solution at room temperature. After complete dissolution, the system was warmed up to 40 °C, prior to the addition of 8.6 g of TEOS. The mixture was then stirred for 20 h followed by hydrothermal ageing at 100 °C under static conditions in an autoclave for 24 h. The material was recovered by filtration and air-dried overnight. Surfactant removal was accomplished by calcination in static air at 550 °C for 5 h. ZrO2-coated SBA-15 material was synthesized according to a previously reported procedure [28]. Thus, 10 g of dry pure silica SBA-15 (prepared as above described) were suspended in 300 mL hexane solution containing the zirconium source (58.5 g of commercial zirconium propoxide solution). This mixture was refluxed overnight before recovering the solid by filtration. Complete removal of non-reacted zirconium species was performed by means of a thorough washing with fresh hexane. Finally, the solid was filtered and dried overnight at 80 °C and then calcined in air at 550 °C for 5 h."
4,Incorporation of ruthenium species,"2.3 Incorporation of ruthenium species Ruthenium species were supported onto the surface of the different mesoporous materials, including pure silica (SBA-15) and ZrO2-coated (ZrO2-SBA-15) mesostructured materials, through a wetness impregnation method. Briefly, the appropriate amount of RuCl3·3H2O (1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 wt% of Ru based on the solid support) was dissolved in a volume of water equivalent to the pore volume of the support, as determined by means of N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm. The solution was then added dropwise onto 1 g of support, and the resultant slurry homogenized for 5 h in an orbital shaker. Samples were then dried at room temperature overnight, and treated in a H2 flow at 300 °C for 2 h in order to achieve the complete reduction of ruthenium species."
5,Catalysts characterization,"2.4 Catalysts characterization The textural properties of the catalysts were assessed by means of N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms conducted on a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 unit. Surface area values were calculated using the B.E.T. method. Pore sizes distributions were calculated through the application of the K.J.S.-corrected B.J.H. method, which was applied to the adsorption branch of the isotherm. Total pore volume was assumed to be that recorded at p/p0 = 0.985. Structural ordering was assessed by means of X-ray powder diffraction on a Philips X’Pert diffractometer using the CuKα line. Bulk metal contents were obtained by means of ICP-OES analysis performed on a Varian Vista AX Axial CCD Simultaneous spectrophotometer. The metal dispersion was calculated through hydrogen chemisorption experiments on an Autosorb iQ unit. Transmission electron microscopy measurements were performed on a Philips Tecnai electron microscope operating a 200 kV. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were obtained using an Escalab 200R electron spectrometer fitted with a twin Mg/Al anode."
6,Catalytic experiments,"2.5 Catalytic experiments The hydrogenation catalytic tests were performed in a 200 mL stainless steel autoclave equipped with temperature controller and a mechanical stirrer, operating under 40 bar of hydrogen. In a typical assay, 150 g of an aqueous solution of D-glucose (20 wt%) together with 150 mg of catalyst were placed inside the reactor (mass ratio catalyst/substrate = 0.005). The system was closed, fluxed with nitrogen and the operating pressure was set with hydrogen at the required value. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was heated up to 150 °C. Time zero was considered once the mixture reached the desired temperature conditions. The analysis of the reaction products was performed in a HPLC unit (Agilent 1260 Infinity instrument) equipped with Hi-Plex Ca (Duo) 300 × 6.5 mm column and an ELS detector. Catalyst reutilization tests were performed by using the catalysts in a second reaction test, with previous recovering of the used catalysts by filtration and washing in ethanol under stirring at room temperature for 4 h. Catalytic results are shown in terms of both substrate conversion (X) and cumulative molar yields towards the different products (Yi). The definitions of these parameters are as follows: X ( % ) = R e a c t e d m o l e o f g l u c o s e I n i t i a l m o l e o f g l u c o s e × 100 Y i % = F o r m e d m o l e o f i I n i t i a l m o l e o f g l u c o s e × s t o i c h i o m e t r i c c o e f f i c i e n t × 100"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Table 1 lists the physicochemical properties of the synthesized mesostructured SBA-15-type supports based on pure silica (SBA-15) and ZrO2-coated silica (ZrO2-SBA-15) materials. Although both supports were prepared from P123 surfactant and display the typical honeycomb structure of SBA-15-type materials, there are significant differences among them from a textural point of view, because of the different synthesis procedure used for each support. The corresponding ruthenium-functionalized catalysts were prepared with 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 wt% Ru loadings (Table 1, samples S1-S3 for SBA-15 and S4-S6 for ZrO2-SBA-15). Textural properties recorded after Ru impregnation, and subsequent reduction, evidence little changes for increasing metal loadings. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms (Fig. 1 A) proof that the incorporation of ruthenium slightly modifies the porous structure of the mesostructured parent materials, whose main variation is focused on the mesoporous volume of the samples. However, the high coincidence of relative isotherms (Fig. 1B), where there is an almost complete overlapping of the different curves, regardless of the metal content, suggests that the incorporation of ruthenium does not take place on preferential porous systems, nor leads to pore blockage. In this way, a homogeneous Ru distribution might be expected all over the surface of the mesostructured materials, and this can be considered a first proof of the achievement of a high metal dispersion. Low-angle XRD patterns (Fig. 2 A) confirm that well-defined hexagonal structure is present in all the SBA-15-based materials. All the samples display XRD diffractions attributable to the interplanar spacings of the typical p6mm hexagonal structure of SBA-15 topology. These diffractions remain almost unaltered after ruthenium incorporation, although the long-range diffractions (110 & 200) become less intense. Again, these results confirm that the incorporation of the Ru species did not cause a significant distortion on the mesoscopic structure of the supports. Fig. 2B shows wide-angle X-ray diffractograms collected for the Ru-functionalized samples after metal incorporation and reduction. The XRD patterns recorded for parent materials are also depicted for reference purposes. Interesting differences can be observed by comparing the two series of materials. Thus, for samples prepared from pure silica SBA-15, only the broad peak located at 2θ = 15-25°, which is associated with the amorphous halo of the SBA-15 material, is observed. This fact, together with the absence of defined diffractions from bulk domains of ruthenium –expected to be present at 2θ = 38.8° [32]–, suggests that the presence of Ru°/RuO2 domains on these catalysts is in the form of very small and apparently well-dispersed particles. When using ZrO2-coated SBA-15 material as support (samples S4-S6), only the diffractions associated with amorphous SBA-15 and tetragonal zirconia (ZrO2(t); 2θ = 30.3°, 50.3 and 60.2°) were observed, regardless of the Ru loading. Therefore, it seems that combining the incipient wetness impregnation method with SBA-15 mesoporous supports leads to a good dispersion of the ruthenium salt, regardless whether the ZrO2 layer is present or not. H2 chemisorption allows to better discriminate the influence of the zirconia layer on the dispersion of the ruthenium active phase. Thus, a higher metal dispersion, associated with smaller ruthenium crystal sizes (Table 1), was achieved for the materials prepared from ZrO2-SBA-15 as support. This difference between the pure-silica SBA-15 and the zirconia coated SBA-15 confirms that supporting a zirconia layer on the SBA-15 mesostructured silica preserves the capability of the metal oxide to promote the dispersion of metal particles to be used as hydrogenation catalytic sites. The distribution of ruthenium particles throughout SBA-15 channels was further studied by means of transmission electron microscopy. Fig. 3 depicts TEM micrographs corresponding to samples prepared with the highest Ru contents (5.0 wt% Ru): S3 (a, b) and S6 (c, d). Well-ordered mesoporous structures can be observed in both materials, which is in good agreement with results coming from adsorption-desorption isotherms (Fig. 1) and low-angle X-ray patterns (Fig. 2B). High-magnification TEM images (Figs. 3b and 3d) allow the observation of ruthenium particles inside SBA-15 pores (small green-circled black dots). Despite ruthenium particle sizes measurements from these TEM images is not accurate, the observed trend seems to confirm the results from hydrogen chemisorption (Table 1), as the size of ruthenium particles is smaller when using ZrO2-coated SBA-15 as support. In conclusion, textural and structural characterization indicates that the coating of SBA-15 surface with a layer of zirconia provides an adequate environment to support well-dispersed small ruthenium particles. Fig. 4 depicts the XPS spectra recorded for Ru-functionalized SBA-15-type materials containing an intermediate Ru loading (2.5 wt%). Due to the strong overlapping of the C1s level, the Ru3p region was selected to evaluate the speciation of the Ru sites, although this has been corrected by subtraction of the Zr3s component, laying in the same binding energy as Ru3p3/2. All the materials displayed high binding energy values at the Ru3p3/2 core level, indicating that most of the ruthenium species are in the form of Ru(IV), that can be ascribed to a mixture of RuOx/Ru species [33]. These results suggest a strong interaction taking place between the support and the ruthenium species. Such an interaction would be stronger in the case of the zirconia-coated SBA-15 support, bearing in mind the shift of the Ru3p3/2 core level BE towards higher values (sample S5) [34]. Table 2 lists the surface composition (elemental ratios) obtained for materials prepared with 2.5 wt% Ru, as well as the core electron binding energies calculated for the different elements present in the samples. Zr:Si, Ru:Zr and Ru:Si atom ratios are just a consequence of the composition of the materials and reveal the concentration of the Ru and Zr species on the surface of the tested samples. This is evident when comparing the binding energy at O1s core level for the sample prepared from ZrO2-coated SBA-15, in which 82 % of the oxygen atoms are attributed to ZrO2 domains, confirming the high coverage degree of the SBA-15 silica surface with the zirconia layer. As for the Zr3d3/2 core level binding energies obtained for sample S5 (182.8 eV, ZrO2-coated) they appear as tetragonal zirconia in the ZrO2-coated-SBA-15 sample."
9,Catalytic tests: Aqueous hydrogenation of glucose,"3.2 Catalytic tests: Aqueous hydrogenation of glucose Ru-functionalized SBA-15-type catalysts bearing 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 wt% metal loadings (samples S1 to S6) were tested in the hydrogenation of aqueous D-glucose solutions under the reaction conditions described in experimental section. Fig. 5 depicts the products distributions obtained in the presence of all the catalysts after reacting glucose aqueous solutions (20 wt%) under 40 bar H2 for 6 h. The distribution of the reaction products is clearly affected by both the nature of the support and the ruthenium content. Thus, for catalysts with 1 wt% of ruthenium loading, the transformation of glucose into sorbitol is maximum in the presence of S4 sample (ZrO2-coated SBA-15), probably due to its higher metal dispersion and lower ruthenium crystal size as compared to sample S1, prepared from pure silica SBA-15 support with a similar metal content. This is in agreement with previous works reporting that the ruthenium particles size is one of the key factors influencing the catalytic activity of ruthenium in glucose hydrogenation [15], [33]. Interestingly, these samples, showing the lowest ruthenium content, also led to the formation of fructose by isomerization of the starting glucose, a catalytic behavior not found in samples bearing higher ruthenium contents. This behavior has been attributed to the presence of acid sites, either present in the solid support –like Zr species in ZrO2-coated SBA-15–, or coming from Run+ species –like those observed by XPS–, in an analogous way to that observed in Pt-containing catalysts [7]. Increasing the ruthenium content (samples S2-S3 and S5-S6) lowers the differences found between the solid supports, as the summation of the products yields after 6 h is very similar for all of them, regardless the ruthenium dispersion. In these cases, only the products distributions make a difference between the samples. Specifically, fructose is not present when using samples prepared with 2.5 and 5.0 wt% Ru. On the other hand, mannitol is produced in a large extent in the presence of ZrO2-SBA-15-supported catalysts. Mannitol can be produced either by hydrogenation of fructose, which is also formed in a high extent in the presence of these materials, or by hydro-isomerization of sorbitol [8]. Kinetic profiles obtained for glucose hydrogenation in the presence of 2.5 wt% loaded onto different supports are shown in Fig. 6 . The figure reveals that scarce amounts of fructose are generated during the early stages of the reaction, whereas mannitol is produced in a much higher extent at long reaction times. In this way, it seems that mannitol is preferentially produced by sorbitol hydro-isomerization on Ru species, rather than by fructose hydrogenation, a catalytic behavior also reported for carbon-supported ruthenium catalysts [8]. This conclusion can also be ascertained from the direct correlation established between the ruthenium loading and the obtained mannitol yield. According to these catalytic results, the proposed reaction network for the catalytic transformation of glucose in the presence of hydrogen over Ru-functionalized SBA-15-type catalysts is depicted in Scheme 1 . Fig. 6 makes also evident the different catalytic performance of ruthenium due to the influence of the support. Thus, ZrO2-coated SBA-15 leads to much more active catalysts than pure silica SBA-15 supports, as it can be ascertained from the faster glucose conversion obtained for this material during the early stages of the reaction. Assuming a first-order pseudo-homogeneous kinetic model, the apparent kinetic constants for glucose hydrogenation, referred to the mass of Ru, were calculated (Fig. 6D). Regardless of the ruthenium content, the catalysts prepared from ZrO2-coated SBA-15 show larger kinetic constant values as compared to materials based on pure silica SBA-15, being the observed differences between these two types of materials more accentuated for 2.5 and 5.0 wt% of Ru. The higher metal dispersion and smaller ruthenium particle sizes achieved when using the zirconia-coated mesostructured support are most likely the main reasons for the higher catalytic activity of these materials."
10,Catalyst stability,"3.3 Catalyst stability The stability of the catalysts has been evaluated by means of a recycling test performed on each material, after convenient recovering and washing of the catalyst samples. This is an important issue to consider the selection of a heterogeneous catalyst to be used in a potential continuous flow application, as the stability of the catalyst directly conditions the lifetime of the same. Fig. 7 depicts the kinetic profiles obtained for two consecutive reaction runs (fresh catalysts and first reuse) for sorbitol yield, obtained in the presence of samples prepared with intermediate ruthenium contents –taken as an example– loaded onto the both SBA-15-type supports. Sample prepared from zirconia-coated SBA-15 materials evidences some loss of catalytic activity, but this was much less intense than that found for Ru-SBA-15 catalyst. The reasons laying on this behavior are related to the stability of the supported Ru particles under the conditions used for the hydrogenation of glucose. It has been previously described that ruthenium supported on silica displays rather low stability under hydrothermal conditions, as determined by the observed growing of the ruthenium particles in Ru/SiO2 catalysts after use in glucose hydrogenation [21]. This obviously conducts to the decreasing of the metal dispersion and, thus, to a partial loss of the starting catalytic activity. Samples used in the reaction tests were subjected to XRD to collect wide-angle patterns, as a way to prove the stability of the dispersed ruthenium active phase. These results have been depicted for samples with intermediate loadings in Fig. 8 . All the fresh catalysts, as above stated (Fig. 2), displayed negligible diffractions attributable to metallic ruthenium species or, at least, these are not clearly distinguishable. On the contrary, after their use in two consecutive reaction experiments, some diffractions are evident in Ru-SBA-15 materials, suggesting similar phenomena to those previously described for Ru/SiO2 [21], i.e. the growth of the ruthenium particles caused by their agglomeration. On the contrary, no diffraction signals attributable to Ru species were detected for used ZrO2-coated SBA-15 materials, suggesting that supported metal particles remained unaltered after the reaction runs, and thus, a much better stability can be ascribed to this material as compared to that prepared from the pure siliceous support. In this way, ZrO2-SBA-15 material reveals as an excellent catalyst support, not only because it enhances the dispersion of metal particles like ruthenium, but also because it avoids the agglomeration of the active phase in aqueous-phase hydrogenation. Moreover, it has been reported that zirconia layers confer an excellent hydrothermal stability to the silica based support, [29] which would suppose an additional advantage when using this kind of supports for aqueous-phase transformations."
11,Conclusions,"Pure silica SBA-15 and ZrO2-coated SBA-15 have been tested as supports to prepare ruthenium-containing catalysts for the hydrogenation of aqueous solutions of glucose to sorbitol. Both the metal loading and the catalyst support influenced the ruthenium dispersion, a key parameter directly linked to the catalytic activity of these materials. The use of these materials under the tested conditions caused dramatic changes in the metal dispersion and stability, depending on the catalyst support. ZrO2-SBA-15 preserved the metal dispersion after catalyst testing, whereas Ru particles supported in the siliceous support (SBA-15) proved prone to agglomeration in aqueous-phase hydrogenation, thus causing a catalytic activity decay after the first use. ZrO2-SBA-15 combines the proper textural properties –large surface area, open porous structure– of silica with the surface physicochemical properties of zirconia, making it a highly interesting material to support ruthenium particles in order to prepare highly active, selective and resistant catalysts for the efficient hydrogenation of aqueous glucose solutions to sorbitol. However, it must be noted that the presence of ZrO2 also enhances the extent of side reactions such as glucose isomerization towards fructose formation and the hydro-isomerization of sorbitol to yield mannitol. Nevertheless, sorbitol selectivity is in any case over 85 % under the tested reaction conditions."
