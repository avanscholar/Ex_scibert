0,Introduction,"The use of fossil fuel has induced very serious environmental pollution. Thus, it is necessary to find alternative energy sources that are renewable and environmentally friendly [1,2]. Hydrogen is expected to be a major energy carrier in the future, essentially due to its non-polluting nature, cost- effective production and versatility in application as fuel [3]. A variety of electrochemical, thermo-chemical and biological processes can be used in the production of renewable hydrogen [4]. However, bio-hydrogen production is attractive because of its energy-saving process as compared to the production from thermo-chemical and electro- chemical processes. The dark fermentation has excellent capability for evolution as a practical bio- hydrogen production because it has several advantages over other methods; besides its simple technology, it can utilize a variety of carbon sources as substrate and does not rely on light availability [3,5]. Anaerobic mixed microflora obtained from wastewater treatment plant sludge have been demonstrated to be of great potential use as seeding for fermentative hydrogen production because it contains a variety of competent hydrogen-producing microorganisms [6]. Heat treatment of sewage sludge at 121 °C for 20 min is found to be suitable in reducing the microbial load by 98% and hydrolyzing the organic fraction of sludge [7]. Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is one of the important economic crops in Thailand with annual production of ca. 17 to 29 million tons during 2004–2009 [8]. Cassava pulp is a left over residue from the starch production industry, which contains as high as 50–60% starch content on dry basis [9], while the other main carbohydrates are cellulose and hemicelluloses [10]. Their major hydrolyzed products, viz. glucose and xylose were reported to be good substrates for hydrogen production [11]. Diluted acid hydrolysis has been successfully developed for pretreatment of sweet potato starch residue and wheat straw for hydrogen production [12,13]. The utilization of cassava pulp for ethanol production had been reported [14–17], however, there has been hitherto no investigation on the bio-hydrogen production from the pulp. Thus the potential use of cassava pulp as raw material for bio-hydrogen production is elaborately investigated in this study. Among the important operating parameters affecting the hydrogen yield and formation rate in dark fermentation are the initial pH, substrate and biomass concentrations [5]. Too low biomass concentrations cause long lag times and slow fermentation rates, while high concentrations may have adverse effect on fermentation yields and rates resulting from the consumption of the end products [6]. Initial pH is also an important factor that influences the activities of hydrogen-producing bacteria, and the fermentative hydrogen production, because it could affect the hydrogenase activity as well as the metabolic pathways [13]. Most studies on the effect of environmental factors on H2 production have used model substrates like sucrose or glucose [18–25], while studies on solid substrates such as food waste have been few [26–30]. Plant materials, such as rice, potato and carrot, were also tested as substrates for fermentative hydrogen production [27,29,30], however, the exploration on the use of energy crop residues like cassava pulp is scarce. Consequently, it would be of great interest in using cassava pulp for effective bio-hydrogen production by mixed culture. This research aims to investigate the conditions for hydrolyzing cassava pulp with acid-hydrolysis in autoclave, the important operating parameters affecting the hydrogen yield and formation rate in batch dark fermentation, e.g. sources of mixed culture, the initial pH, substrate concentrations, and biomass concentrations. This approach would not only reduce the pollution load created from the cassava starch industry but also add value to cassava pulp by bioconversion to hydrogen."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inocula and substrate,"2.1 Inocula and substrate Cassava pulp used in this study was obtained from a local starch industry in Kalasin, Thailand. The main composition (w w−1) of the cassava pulp comprises of 80.2% moisture with the solid contents on dry basis of 66.4% starch, 2.1% protein, 28.8% fiber, 0.2% fat, 2.5% ash. Three sources of anaerobic mixed culture (MC) from wastewater treatment plants utilized as seed inocula were (1) anaerobic sludge obtained from the sedimentation tank of the anaerobic wastewater treatment plant of a local distilleries industry, Khon Kaen, Thailand (MC-1), (2) the Up-flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket granule obtained from the UASB wastewater treatment plant of a local brewery company, Khon Kaen, Thailand (MC-2) and (3) the UASB granule obtained from the UASB wastewater treatment plant of a local starch industry, Kalasin, Thailand (MC-3). The characteristics of the three mixed cultures in terms of pH, COD, total suspended solid (TSS), volatile suspended solid (VSS) and alkalinity were as shown in Table 1 . pH was measured by a digital pH meter (Sartorius, Germany). Concentrations of TSS and VSS were measured by a 5 ml sample at 105 °C for 4 h and 600 °C for 2 h, respectively. The COD was determined from the filtrate samples through a 0.45 mm membrane. All the parameters, viz. TSS, VSS, COD and alkalinity were analyzed according to standard methods [36]. The culture was concentrated by sedimentation and the concentrated sludge was heat-treated at 105 °C in a hot air oven for 2 h [22] in order to eliminate the hydrogen consuming methanogens and to select the spore forming and hydrogen producing acidogenic bacteria. The heat-treated seed was anaerobically cultivated in a synthetic medium containing glucose (60 g L−1), peptone (10 g L−1), yeast extract (0.6 g L−1), MgSO4·7H2O (0.25 g L−1), K2HPO4 (1 g L−1), KH2PO4 (1 g L−1), L cysteine–HCl·H2O (0.1 g L−1) at 35 °C and pH = 6.5 in an incubator shaker [31]. Argon gas was purged into the cultivation medium before incubation and the cultivation flasks were closed with gas-tight silicone stoppers and screw caps. The cultivated seed inocula were used for inoculation of experimental bottles after three days of incubation [13,31]."
3,Acidification pretreatment of the substrate,"2.2 Acidification pretreatment of the substrate Acid hydrolysis of cassava pulp fraction was conducted at 121 °C, 1.5 Kg cm−2 for 60 min in autoclave with a mass ratio of solid (g dry weight) to liquid (ml) at 1:15 [32]. Cassava pulp was hydrolyzed by H2SO4 at various concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5% (v v−1). The hydrolysate from each condition was analyzed for sugar contents as well as the concentrations of acetic acid and furfural. The optimum concentration of H2SO4 that yield the hydrolysate which gave the highest sugar content was further used to investigate the effect of reaction times on hydrolysis of cassava pulp. After hydrolysis, the solid residue was separated by filtration through a thin layer cloth. The pH of hydrolysate was adjusted to pH 10 with Ca(OH)2, the resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation (1500 rpm, 15 min) and then reacidified to pH 7.0 [33], followed by further centrifugation to discard the sediment."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure 2.3.1 Comparison of seed cultures and selection of the optimal initial pH All the hydrogen fermentation experiments were carried out in batch process at a constant incubation temperature of 35 °C. Each treatment was performed in duplicate in 100 ml serum bottles with a working volume of 70 ml comprising of 60 ml of cassava pulp hydrolysate, 10% (v v−1), viz. 7 ml of each mixed culture (MC-1, MC-2 or MC-3), 1.5 ml of 3.75% (w v−1) l-cysteine as a reducing agent and 1.5 ml of nutrient stock solution. Nutrient solution contains (in g L−1) NH4HCO3, 80; KH2PO4, 1.24; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1; NaCl, 0.01; Na2MoO4·2H2O 0.01; CaCl2·2H2O, 0.01; MnSO4·7H2O, 0.015; and FeCl2, 0.0278 [28]. The tested initial pH was varied from 5.0 to 8.0 using 1N HCl or 1N NaOH, while the initial total sugar was fixed at 20 g COD L−1. Both liquid and gas samples were taken every 5 h interval for analyses according to 2.4. The best seed culture and the optimum pH for hydrogen production obtained from this experiment were further used to investigate the effect of initial substrate and biomass concentrations on the hydrogen production. 2.3.2 Determination of optimal initial total sugar concentration The initial total sugar concentrations ranging from 5 to 40 g COD L−1 were obtained by acid hydrolysis with appropriate pulp to acid ratios and accurate dilutions, while the medium pH was adjusted to 5.5. Samples were taken out every 5 h for analyses and the hydrogen production in terms of hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield were monitored and compared to select the optimal total sugar concentration. 2.3.3 Determination of the optimal biomass concentration In this experiment the serum bottles (100 ml) contained 63 ml cassava pulp hydrolysate media with the optimum pH and the optimal total sugar concentration were inoculated with different quantities of inoculum culture to yield initial biomass concentration between 0.5 and 5 g L−1 by assuming the VSS values as the biomass concentrations. The inoculated bottles were placed in an incubator at a constant temperature of 35 °C. The volume of biogas produced was measured by plunger displacement method [34,35]. The sample analyses were according to 2.4."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Hydrolysate samples were centrifuged, filtered through 0.45 μm cellulose acetate membrane and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for total sugar content (glucose xylose, arabinose), acetic acid and furfural. The HPLC analysis were carried out using a LC-10AD (Shimadzu, Japan) with an analysis column (Biorad, Aminex HPX-87H column) maintained at 40OC in a column oven, 1 mM H2SO4 as mobile phase at the flow rate of 0.6 ml min−1 and a refraction index detector (Shimadzu-RID-6A). Total sugar concentration in the hydrolysate is a summation of glucose, xylose and arabinose concentrations obtained from HPLC analysis in each case. Samples from the liquid phase were analyzed for total sugars (TS), reducing sugars (RS), and total volatile fatty acids (TVFAs). VSS were measured according to Standard Methods [36], understanding that VSS is the volatile fraction of TSS after ignition [37]. The components of biogas in the headspace including hydrogen, nitrogen, methane and carbon dioxide were determined using a gas chromatography (GC, Shimadzu 2014, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and 3 m × 3 mm diameter stainless-steel column packed with activated charcoal (60/80 mesh) (GL Science Inc., Japan). The temperatures of injector, detector and column oven were 150, 145 and 150 °C, respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 25 ml min−1. The concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) including acetic (HAc), propionic (HPr), normal butyric (HBu) acids and solvents including ethanol (EtOH) and butanol (BuOH) were determined using GC (Shimadzu 17A, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 3 m × 3.2 mm diameter glass column packed with Unisole F-200 (30/60 mesh) (GL Science Inc., Japan). The operational temperatures of the injector, detector and column oven were 150, 140 and 150 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas with flow rate of 50 ml min−1."
6,Data fitting,"2.5 Data fitting The volume of biogas produced was calculated by a mass balance equation previously described by Zheng and Yu [38]. The cumulative hydrogen production followed the modified Gompertz equation (Equation (1)) [39]: (1) H ( t ) = P exp { − exp [ R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H is the cumulative volume of hydrogen produced (ml), P is the H2 production potential or HP (ml), R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate or HPR (ml H2 L−1 d−1), λ is the lag phase time (h), t is the incubation time (h) and e is the exp (1) = 2.71828. The cumulative hydrogen gas production was determined by using the mass balance equation [31]. (2) V H , i = V H , i − 1 + C H , i ( V G , i − V G , i − 1 ) + V H , 0 ( C H , i − C H , i − 1 ) Where V H,i and V H,i-1 are the cumulative hydrogen gas volumes at the current and previous time, respectively; V G,i and V G,i-1 are total biogas volume at the current and previous time; C H,i and C H,i-1 are the fraction of hydrogen gas in the headspace at the current and previous times respectively; V H is the volume of headspace of serum bottles (30 ml)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Composition of cassava pulp hydrolysate,"3.1 Composition of cassava pulp hydrolysate Table 2 shows the composition of cassava pulp hydrolysate when hydrolyzed by different H2SO4 concentrations and reaction times. Glucose and xylose were found as the main hydrolysis products of cassava pulp. The HPLC results indicated that a small amount of arabinose was also found in the hydrolysates. The concentrations of glucose and xylose were the highest, viz. 12.55 and 9.67 g L−1 respectively, when cassava pulp was hydrolyzed with 0.5% H2SO4 for 60 min. However, glucose and xylose concentrations in cassava pulp hydrolysate decreased slightly as the H2SO4 concentration was increased to between 1.0 and 5.0% (v v−1) and prolonged reaction times of 60–120 min. The maximal concentrations of glucose (13.44 g L−1) and xylose (11.66 g L−1) were obtained as cassava pulp was hydrolyzed by 0.5% H2SO4 for 30 min. The increase in H2SO4 concentrations and treatment times caused the decrease in glucose and xylose yields, while there was a continuous increase in growth inhibitors (acetic acid and furan derivatives such as furfural) in the hydrolysates, which is in accordance with the report of Cantarella et al. [40]. The increase of acid concentration could provide higher H+ ions in the solution, leading to the higher degradation rates of starch and lignocellulosic material in the cassava pulp [41,42]. However, excess H+ ions from a strong acid can cause further degradation of sugars and formation of organic acids and furan derivatives which are inhibitors to fermentation microbes [41,43]. Furan derivatives were formed upon further degradation of sugars and organic acids released from the degradation of hemicellulose side-groups [42,44,45]. Furfural has been reported to inhibit protein and RNA synthesis and damage microorganisms by reduction of biological and enzymatic activities [46]. The results indicated that furfural significantly increased with an increase in H2SO4 concentration (p ≤ 0.05). Acetic acid is another inhibitory substance founded in cassava pulp hydrolysate. Aguilar et al. [47] and Rodriguez-Chong et al. [48] reported that the concentration of acetic acid between 4 and 10 g L−1 could diffuse through the cell membrane and decrease intracellular pH causing the toxic effect to metabolism and inhibit the growth of microorganisms. Table 1 showed that acetic acid content increased with the longer reaction time, however, it was not affected by the concentration of H2SO4, and its content did not affect the microbial growth. The evidence of the decrease in glucose and xylose yields and the appearance of acetic acid and furfural in the hydrolysates at the higher acid concentrations implied that sugars were further degraded by strong acid. Consequently, mild acid hydrolysis condition (0.5% H2SO4 at 121 °C for 30 min) was selected to minimize undesirable inhibiting byproducts while attaining high resulting sugar yields for hydrogen production by mixed seed cultures."
9,Sources of mixed culture for hydrogen production,"3.2 Sources of mixed culture for hydrogen production The effect of sources of mixed culture on hydrogen production from cassava pulp hydrolysate was investigated at a fixed initial total sugar concentration of 20 g COD L−1. Initial pH was fixed at 6.0. The results indicated that the seed culture obtained from the UASB granule sludge (MC-2) of a local brewery company yielded the highest hydrogen production, hydrogen production rate (HPR) and hydrogen yield (HY) of 350 ml, 3812 ml H2 L−1 d−1, and 334 ml H2 g−1 CODreduced, respectively (Table 2, Fig. 1 )."
10,Effect of initial cultivation pH on batch hydrogen fermentation,"3.3 Effect of initial cultivation pH on batch hydrogen fermentation pH is an important factor that influences the fermentative hydrogen production and activities of hydrogen-producing bacteria because it could affect the metabolism pathways as well as the hydrogenase activity [49]. The effect of the initial pH of cassava pulp hydrolysate on hydrogen production by UASB granule sludge (MC-2) was investigated at a fixed initial biomass concentration of 2.0 g L−1 and initial total sugar concentration of 20 g COD L−1. The hydrogen production potential, the maximum hydrogen production rate (HPR) and hydrogen yield (HY) were estimated using modified Gompertz equation. Regardless of initial pH value, pH of the cultures dropped during the cultivation to the final value of around 4.1–4.6 (Table 4 ). The initial pH values affected the cumulative hydrogen production significantly. The highest cumulative volume of hydrogen (358 ml) was obtained from the medium with the initial pH of 5.5, while the medium initial pH of 8.0 gave the lowest cumulative volume of hydrogen (125 ml) as indicated in Fig 2 . The results of previous reports about the optimal initial pH for fermentative hydrogen production were diverse, e.g. the optimal initial pH as reported by Mu et al. [50] and Khanal et al. [22] were 4.2 and 4.5 respectively, while that reported by Zhao and Yu [51] was 7.0 and by Lee et al. [52] was 9.0. The possible reason for this disagreement was the difference of these studies in the terms of inoculum, substrate and initial pH range. The present study showed that the medium initial pH 5.0 and 5.5 were found to be favorable for hydrogen production (290–360 ml), which were closely in agreement with those reported by Zoetemeyer et al. [53] and Chen et al. [54] as 5.0-6.0 to be the optimal pH range for hydrogen production from glucose by anaerobic fermentative bacteria with the maximum hydrogen evolution efficiency. The initial pH of too low (<5.0) or too high (>6.5) could result in a low hydrogen production in which the activity of hydrogenase could be inhibited [33]. Our results revealed that pH range 7.0–8.0 lowered the level of hydrogen production (120–160 ml) (Fig 2), which was in agreement with the findings that increasing pH causes a decrease in hydrogen production owing to a switch in the metabolism of sugar [20,25,52,55] and the cell growth at a higher pH was more efficient than the hydrogen production [54]. Thus an increase in initial pH led to a decrease in HPR, HP and hydrogen yield. It was also observed in this investigation that an initial pH of 5.5 gave the highest, HPR and hydrogen yield of approximately 356 ml, 3528 ml H2 L−1 d−1 and 285.6 ml H2 g-1CODreduced, respectively (Fig. 3 ). Anaerobic hydrogen production is accompanied with VFAs production. The effects of VFAs on the fermentative bacteria are associated with the pH values of the medium [25,54]. During the fermentation process VFAs were produced as intermediate products, the kinds and concentrations of which could be useful indicators for monitoring hydrogen production. Table 4 suggests that hydrogen production remarkably increased as high butyric acid (HBu) concentration was produced, i.e. at higher (HBu/HAc) ratios, the higher hydrogen production was obtained. The ratio of HBu/TVFAs was highest in fermentative broth at the initial pH of 5.5, which enhanced the hydrogen yield. These results indicate that hydrogen production is favorable as HBu fermentation predominates. The results were in accordance with previous reports [56–58] indicating that butyric acid–acetic acid fermentation is characterized by the production of butyric and acetic acid, plus carbon dioxide and hydrogen in acidogenic fermentation pathways. According to the stoichiometry, the butyric acid–acetic acid fermentative reactions could be described as in equation (3) [55]. (3) 3 C 5 H 10 O 5 + 4 C 6 H 12 O 6 + 3 H 2 O → 3 C 2 H 4 O 2 + 5 C 4 H 8 O 2 + 13 CO 2 + 16 H 2 The maximum hydrogen production is generally associated with the ratio of HBu/TVFAs, the results also show that the initial pH of 5.5 gave the maximum hydrogen yield of 285.6 ml H2 g-1CODreduced with the maximum of HBu/TVFAs ratio of 0.85 (Table 3). This result was in accordance with Chen et al. [54] which indicated that the highest hydrogen production from glucose by mixed cultures from sewage sludge occurred at the maximum HBu/TVFAs ratio. Hence, the pH control at an optimum value is needed in order to obtain high hydrogen productivity. This implies that the selected mixed bacterial species are good producers of butyric acid and acetic acid, thus induced the production of hydrogen, and the optimal pH was required for the butyric acid–acetic acid fermentative metabolism. The results suggest that Clostridium species could be the predominant microorganisms because they are responsible for the butyric acid–acetic acid fermentation route [54]."
11,Effects of initial total sugar concentrations on hydrogen production,"3.4 Effects of initial total sugar concentrations on hydrogen production The hydrogen production by MC-2 inoculum was investigated to study the effect of initial total sugar concentrations of cassava pulp hydrolysate by adjusting to 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 30.0 and 40.0 g COD L−1 using the optimal initial pH 5.5 and incubation temperature at 35 °C. Distilled water was used as control in this experiment. Fig. 4 indicated that the hydrogen production increased with the increase of initial total sugar concentration from 5 to 25 g COD L−1 and decreased when the initial total sugar concentrations were 30 g COD L−1 and 40 g COD L−1. The cumulative H2 yield increased remarkably with the increasing initial total sugar concentration from 207 ml H2 g-1CODreduced as the initial total sugar concentration was 5 g COD L−1 to 342 ml H2 g-1CODreduced as the initial total sugar concentration of 25 g COD L−1 was used. The maximum hydrogen yield was found to be at the initial total sugar concentration of 25 g COD L−1. Beyond this, the cumulative H2 yield decreased and lowered to 207 ml H2 g-1CODreduced as the initial total sugar concentration was 40 g COD L−1 (Table 5 ). The highest, HPR and hydrogen yield of approximately 358 ml, 3381 ml H2 L−1 d−1 and 342 ml H2 g-1CODreduced were obtained as the initial total sugar concentration of 25 g COD L-1was used (Fig. 4). Their HPR and hydrogen yield decreased at the initial total sugar concentration of 30 g COD L−1 and 40 g COD L−1, which could be resulted from the substrate inhibition [59]. The results revealed that the excessive substrate concentrations causes the accumulation of VFAs in the system leading to a decline of pH in the medium, and thus leads to the increase in partial pressure of the fermentation system. The hydrogen production would be switched to solvent production as the partial pressure in the headspace of the reactor increased, consequently the growth of hydrogen producers and hydrogen production would be inhibited [1,5,59]. Liquid product analysis shows that the major VFAs components in liquid metabolites at various initial total sugar concentrations are mainly butyrate (HBu) and acetate (HAc) with small amounts of propionate (HPr) (Table 4). The results indicated that the initial total sugar concentration of 25 g COD L−1 with the maximum of HBu/TVFAs ratio of 0.84 resulted in the maximum hydrogen yield (342 ml H2 g-1CODreduced) (Table 5). The optimal conditions obtained from 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, viz. the use of UASB granule sludge (MC-2) at initial pH 5.5 and initial total sugar concentration of 25 g COD L−1 were further used to investigate the effect of initial biomass concentrations on hydrogen production from acid-hydrolyzed cassava pulp."
12,Effect of initial biomass concentrations on batch hydrogen fermentation,"3.5 Effect of initial biomass concentrations on batch hydrogen fermentation Fig. 5 showed the variations of cumulative hydrogen (ml) with time for different initial biomass concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5 g L−1, while the initial total sugar concentration was fixed at 25 g COD L−1. Cumulative hydrogen production increased with the initial biomass concentration up to 3.0 g L−1, however, further increase in initial biomass concentration resulted in lower cumulative hydrogen production (Fig. 5). The results from Table 6 indicated that the optimal initial substrate/biomass (S 0/X 0) ratio of 8.33 yielded the highest cumulative hydrogen formation (387 ml H2). This S 0/X 0 ratio was approximately the same as that determined by Argun et al. [31] who reported that the optimal initial substrate/biomass (S 0/X 0) ratio for hydrogen production from boiled powdered wheat starch by batch dark fermentation was 8.0 g substrate g−1 biomass (Table 7 ). Table 6 summarizes the Gompertz equation coefficients obtained from hydrogen production using different initial biomass concentrations. The hydrogen production decreased as biomass concentration increased so as the S 0/X 0 ratio was less than 8.33. The results were in accordance with previous reports [31,60,61]. The main reasons are that higher biomass concentrations could affect the hydrogen formation because hydrogen would be consumed for acetic acid formation by the acetogenic bacteria and the product inhibition by H2 and VFAs might cause the decrease in the hydrogen production. The hydrogen yields obtained from different anaerobic fermentation systems as reported in selected literature are compared with that obtained in this work. As shown in Table 6 it could be observed that by using the optimal fermentation condition the hydrogen yield as high as 342.8 ml H2 g-1CODreduced, about the same as that reported by Fang et al. [62] using rice slurry, could be achieved. The results indicated that hydrogen production from cassava pulp hydrolysate by batch dark fermentation has a high potential of application."
13,Conclusion,"The present investigation shows that it is possible to produce H2 from cassava pulp hydrolysate by UASB granule sludge in a batch process and that the yields are highly dependent on several factors. The hydrogen yield (HY) and the hydrogen production rate (HPR) were maximum at the total sugar concentration of 25 g COD L-1with the initial biomass concentration of 3.0 g L−1 and the initial medium pH of 5.5 with peak values of hydrogen yield (HY) of 342 ml H2 g-1CODreduced and the hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 3381 ml H2 L−1 d−1. The optimum substrate/biomass (S 0/X 0) maximizing the hydrogen yield and formation rate was determined to be 8.33. During the bioconversion of cassava pulp hydrolysate to hydrogen, acetate, butyrate, butanol and ethanol were the main metabolic by-products in the process. It clearly evidenced that the high hydrogen productivity occurs concurrently with the formation of VFAs and alcohols. The investigation suggests that cassava pulp could be pretreated by dilute acid hydrolysis to sugar containing hydrolysate and anaerobically fermented for hydrogen production."
