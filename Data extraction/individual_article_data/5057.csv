0,Introduction,"The fossil fuels depletion and the environmental deterioration have spurred intense research on sustainable, eco-friendly, and high-efficient new energy systems [1–6]. Hydrogen, as a promising alternative renewable chemical fuel for the future energy requirements, has attracted increasing attention due to its high energy density and contamination-free oxidation reaction [7–11]. To date, electrochemical water splitting is proven a promising method to cleanly produce hydrogen via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [12–15]. Nevertheless, the highly efficient and stable catalysts are in urgent need due to its complex reaction mechanism, which is composed of the following three steps [16,17]: (1) Volmer reaction: A + H 2 O + e − ↔ A H a d s + O H − (2) Tafel reaction: 2 A H a d s ↔ H 2 + 2 A (3) Heyrovsky reaction: H 2 O + e − + A H a d s ↔ H 2 + A + O H − These reactions are usually kinetically sluggish and need to overcome large energy barriers to proceed [18,19]. Although lots of efforts have been devoted to the research of non-noble-metal HER catalysts (such as carbon nitride [20] and transition metal sulfides [21,22], selenides [23,24], phosphides [25,26], nitrides [27], etc.), their catalytic performance is barely satisfactory. Till now, some Ru-based catalysts has been proved a great potential for HER [28,29], whereas platinum (Pt)-based nanomaterials are still the most efficient catalysts towards HER owing to the optimal hydrogen binding energy [30]. Unfortunately, the scarcity and high cost of Pt have largely hindered its widespread use [31,32]. Consequently, tremendous efforts have been expended to disperse Pt nanoparticles on various supports to develop high-efficient catalysts with low Pt-content [33]. Owing to the remarkable electrical conductivity, electrochemical stability, chemical inertness and low cost, carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [34], onion-like fullerenes [35,36], graphene nanospheres [37], graphene oxide [38], etc. have been confirmed as ideal substrates for Pt particles [39]. Moreover, our previous studies demonstrated that graphitic carbon supports not only effectively improve the catalysts' activity via preventing particle agglomeration, but also provid an underlying framework for electron conduction and gas diffusion [40–42]. Among various carbon materials, porous carbon has gained more researchers’ preference on account of its ultra-high specific surface area, tunable pore size and swift mass transport. Besides, the porous structure is able to disperse and stabilize catalytically-active sites [43,44]. Particularly, Deng et al. reported the “bread leavening method” to prepare hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) with large surface area and controllable pore distributions, which provides an eco-friendly strategy for mass production of catalyst supports [45]. In this paper, HPC was synthesized from sucrose via the “bread leavening method” and used as the support of Pt nanoparticles. In comparison with commercial carbon black (CB), which is derived from petroleum-based products, the as-prepared HPC is much more eco-friendly on account of the regenerated biomass precursor. The Pt nanoparticles with an average size of 2.11 nm are well dispersed on HPC and present an outstanding HER catalytic performance with much lower onset potential and overpotential, as well as a better long-term durability in comparison with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. It indicates the HPC is an ideal catalyst support thanks to its hierarchically porous structure, large specific surface area, abundant oxygen-containing functional groups and defect sites."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sucrose (powder, GR) was purchased from Macklin. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, AR) and absolute ethyl alcohol (AR) were purchased from Aladdin. Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O, 99%) was purchased from Energy Chemical Co., Ltd. Nafion (5 wt%) and commercial CB were purchased from Shanghai Hesen Electric Co., Ltd. Commercial Pt/C catalysts (20 wt%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Co., Ltd. Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4, AR) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, AR) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ultrapure water used throughout all experiments was treated through a Thermo Scientific water purification system."
3,Synthesis of Pt/HPC,"2.2 Synthesis of Pt/HPC The HPC was synthesized through the “bread leavening” method [45]. Typically, sucrose and NaHCO3 at a mass ratio of 1:4 were ground in an agate mortar to mix completely. Subsequently, the fine mixture was calcined at 400 °C for 1 h and then at 900 °C for 1 h in a tube furnace under Ar atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. After cooling down naturally to room temperature, the obtained black solid was ground to powder and stirred in HCl aqueous solution (v/v = 1:1) for 6 h at room temperature. Finally, the desired product was obtained after being filtered, water scrubbed, and dried at 60 °C overnight. The obtained HPC was further used as catalyst support to synthesize Pt/HPC through an impregnation-reduction method [37]. Typically, 30 mg HPC and 1393 μL H2PtCl6·6H2O (16.4 mM) were added into 0.5 mL absolute ethyl alcohol. After ultrasonic dispersion for 1 h, the mixture was dried at 60 °C in a vacuum drying oven for 6 h. Then, the obtained black powder was reduced gently at 100 °C for 1 h under a 10 vol % H2 flow (with balance Ar) at a flow rate of 200 sccm. Finally, the desired product was obtained after being washed with absolute ethyl alcohol for several times and then dried at 60 °C for 3 h. The samples with different Pt content were synthesized following the same route above other than varying the volume of H2PtCl6·6H2O solution: 93 μL, 464 μL, 929 μL, 1857 μL, 2786 μL."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Scanning electron microscope (SEM, TESCAN, LYRA3 XMH) equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Oxford Instruments, X-MaxN) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL, JEM-2010) were employed to characterize the obtained samples. The high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images were recorded at 60 kV in a spherical-aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM, Nion, UltraSTEM 100). The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Aolong Instrument Co., Ltd, Y2000) patterns recorded with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm) were used to characterize the crystalline properties. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos, Axis Ultra DLD) was used to characterize the element composition and valence state of the samples. Raman spectra analysis was conducted by DXR Smart Raman spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) equipped with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, pore size distribution curves, and BET measurements were carried out at 77.17 K by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical measurements were carried out by using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, CH Instruments, Inc.) with a standard three-electrode system in the electrolyte of 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. Before electrochemical test, the electrolyte was purged by nitrogen for 30 min at room temperature. In three-electrode system, Ag/AgCl (filled with saturation KCl solution) electrode, graphite rod (6 mm in diameter) and glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 5 mm in diameter, 0.196 cm2 in area) were used as reference electrode, counter electrode and working electrode, respectively. Typically, the working electrode was prepared as follows: 4 mg catalyst was dispersed in 30 μL Nafion solution and 1 mL absolute ethyl alcohol. Then, the mixture was sonicated for at least 30 min to form a homogeneous ink. Finally, 5 μL of the ink (containing ∼2.74 μg of Pt) was dropped onto GCE and allowed to dry naturally. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) was conducted over controlled potential range of the working electrode including the H underpotential deposition (UPD) region at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plot was used to examine the electrochemical activity of these samples at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in the voltage range of −0.3 to 0.1 V versus Ag/AgCl electrode. The Tafel slope was obtained from the LSV plot. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at the polarization voltage −0.03 V in a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with an AC amplitude of 5 mV. The durability test was performed by applying cyclic potential sweeps between −0.3 and 0.1 V at a sweep rate of 100 mV s−1 for 2000 cycles and the chronoamperometric response was recorded at a static potential of −0.225 V for 10 h. All the results above were obtained by iR compensation and all the potentials were calibrated to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the formula [46]: E ( R H E ) = E ( A g / A g C l ) + 0.059 p H + 0.197 V"
6,Results and discussions,
7,Characterization of HPC,"3.1 Characterization of HPC We designed a two-step pyrolysis route to prepare the HPC through the “sucrose leavening method”. During the calcining step at 400 °C, the NaHCO3 decomposed completely to release gas (2NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O), and thus generate a porous structure. When the temperature was raised to 900 °C, the Na2CO3 decomposed partly to produce a small quantity of Na2O and CO2 (Na2CO3 → Na2O + CO2), and the sucrose polymerized and carbonized thoroughly. The porous morphology of the prepared HPC is characterized by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 1 a and b, the obtained HPC has a 3D hierarchically porous framework with haphazard distributive pores sized from a few nanometers to several hundred nanometers, resulting in high specific surface area. The TEM images (Fig. 1c, d and e) show porous structure with obvious thicker walls (∼4 nm) at the junctions of pores and thinner walls on the edge of a pore, which is consistent with the structure observed in the SEM images. More detailed structural and composition studies of HPC are carried out with XRD, Raman, XPS, and the nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements in comparison with CB which acts as the support in the commercial Pt/C catalysts. The XRD patterns of both samples in Fig. 1f show two peaks centering at around 25° and 43°, which are indexed to the (002) and (101) plane of typical graphite, respectively. The sharp (002) peak implies the relatively high degree of graphitization of the synthesized HPC by the “leavening method” [47]. The Raman spectra of HPC and CB (Fig. 1g) are divided into five peaks including G and D1-D4, in which G band at ∼1575 cm−1 refers to the ideal graphitic lattice. While, D1 band at ∼1350 cm−1, D2 band at ∼1600 cm−1, and D4 band at ∼1200 cm−1 represent the disordered graphitic lattice (graphene layer edges, surface graphene layers, and ionic impurities), and D3 band at ∼1500 cm−1 refers to the amorphous carbon [37]. The relative intensity ratio of the D (∼1360 cm−1) and G (∼1580 cm−1) band (ID/IG ratio), which is calculated from the area ratio here, is proportional to the density of defects in the carbon nanostructure [48]. The higher ID/IG value for HPC (1.95) than CB (1.48) clearly indicates that there are more defect sites on HPC than those on CB. The element compositions and chemical bonds analyses of samples are characterized by XPS. The high-resolution spectra of C 1s for HPC and CB (Fig. 1h) can be reasonably divided into four well resolved peaks ascribed to the following carbon functional groups: CC (sp2, ∼284.7 eV), C–O (∼285.2–285.5 eV), CO (∼286.5–286.8 eV), and O–CO (∼289.6–289.3 eV). The ratio of these groups shown in Table 1 clearly indicates that the content of oxygen-containing functional groups (C–O, CO and O–CO) on HPC (61.0%) is higher than that on CB (50.3%). On the one hand, these functional groups, which mainly derive from the sucrose, can effectively improve the surface wettability of HPC and increase the surface free energy [49,50]. On the other hand, they can act as nucleation sites to anchor metal particles, which are beneficial to the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and thus improve catalytic performance [51]. In addition, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms (shown in Fig. 1i) indicate that the HPC possesses much larger specific surface area (1097.05 m2 g−1) than that of CB (96.09 m2 g−1). And the hysteresis loop in the isotherm of HPC also declares the existence of mesopores [52]. Simultaneously, the pore size distribution curves (shown in Fig. S1) over the range of 0–10 nm indicate that the mesopore diameters are located at about 2.1 nm and 3.8 nm for HPC, and 2.9 nm for CB. The curves also suggest that HPC possesses larger porosities, which is in favor of the augment of surface area and enhancement of catalytic performance. Accordingly, the as-prepared HPC is proved to be of great potential to substitute commercial CB as the catalyst support."
8,Physical characterization of Pt/HPC,"3.2 Physical characterization of Pt/HPC The Pt nanoparticles on Pt/HPC are studied by HAADF-STEM and EDS. As shown in the HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 2 a), the Pt nanoparticles (bright spots) are uniformly dispersed on the surface of HPC. The average size of Pt nanoparticles is approximately 2.11 nm via counting the particle size distribution of one hundred nanoparticles, which is much smaller than the Pt particles in the commercial catalyst (2.66 nm in diameter, shown in Fig. S2). The uninform dispersion of Pt particles can also be verified by the EDS mapping results in Fig. S3. Besides, the Pt content of all Pt/HPC samples is measured to be 1.0, 4.6, 9.2, 14.1, 18.7, and 28.5 wt% respectively according to EDS analysis. We identify the sample as Pt/HPC-x, where x stands for the content of Pt, such as Pt/HPC-1.0. The lattice fringe spacing of Pt nanoparticle is measured to be 0.226 nm in the atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 2b), which can be ascribed to the (111) plane of Pt in face-centered cubic phase. Furthermore, the diffraction rings in the corresponding SAED spectrum in Fig. 2c are attributed to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of Pt, which demonstrate the good crystallinity of Pt nanoparticles supported on HPC [53]. The XRD spectrum of Pt/HPC is shown in Fig. 2d. The diffraction peak at 25.85° is attributed to the (002) plane of carbon, while the peaks at 39.67°, 46.18°, 67.57° and 81.38° represent the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of Pt (PDF#04–0802) respectively, indicating a face centered cubic phase. Apart from these main peaks, there are two weaker peaks located at 42.52° and 85.94° corresponding to the (100) and (006) plane of carbon (PDF#41–1487). Moreover, the sharp diffraction peaks of Pt indicate the high crystallinity of Pt nanoparticles. These results are consistent with the electron microscopy analysis. According to the Scherrer's equation ( D = K γ B c o s θ ), the average size of Pt particles is calculated using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak at 39.67° to be 2.39 nm [54], which is in agreement with the aforementioned counting result. The chemical nature of Pt in the hybrid Pt/HPC material is examined by high-resolution XPS spectrum of Pt 4f (shown in Fig. 2e). The doublet binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 can be further divided into two valence states including Pt0 (located at 71.8 eV and 75.1 eV) corresponding to the metal Pt and Pt2+ (located at 72.7 eV and 76.0 eV) originating from the surface oxidation of metallic Pt [55]. The value of Pt0: Pt2+ based on the ratio of peak area can be calculated to be 1.77 : 1, which is much larger than that of Pt/C (calculated from Fig. S4 to be 1.49 : 1), suggesting that the most of Pt exist in the form of metallic Pt which may be beneficial to improve the electrochemical catalytic activity and stability [56]. It is shown in the bright-field TEM images of Pt/HPC (Fig. S5) that the porous structure of the support remains unchanged. Besides, the C 1s region of the XPS spectrum for Pt/HPC (Fig. S6) is in accordance with HPC and the ratio of oxygen-containing functional groups (60.2%, Table S1) is similar to that of HPC. These results manifest that the introduction of Pt nanoparticles has a negligible effect on the structure of the HPC support."
9,Electrochemical measurements of Pt/HPC,"3.3 Electrochemical measurements of Pt/HPC The main objective of this investigation is to examine the electrocatalytic performance of Pt/HPC towards HER. The HER activity is evaluated by measuring the LSV curves in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at 2 mV s−1. The LSV curves of Pt/HPC with different Pt loadings are recorded in Fig. S7a. With the Pt loading increasing from 1.0 wt% to 14.1 wt%, the overpotential required to achieve the current density of −10 mA cm−2 decreases from 66 mV to 24 mV. However, when the Pt loading increases to 18.7 wt% even to 28.5 wt%, the overpotential reaches to 28 mV and 34 mV, respectively. The SEM and TEM images indicate that the reduced catalytic activity with higher Pt loadings resulted from the agglomeration of Pt particles in these two samples (Fig. S8). The polarization curves of the most active sample Pt/HPC-14.1, bare HPC, and commercial Pt/C are compared in Fig. 3 a. The curve of bare HPC exhibits a nearly horizontal line in the visible area, which means a negligible electrocatalytic performance. To achieve a current density of −10 mA cm−2, the overpotential of 26 mV is required for the commercial Pt/C while a relatively lower overpotential (24 mV) is needed for Pt/HPC-14.1. Additionally, Pt/HPC-14.1 displays an onset potential of −10 mV, which is much more positive than that of the commercial Pt/C (−18 mV). These results clearly reveal that Pt/HPC-14.1 can effectively facilitate the HER process and exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity than the commercial Pt/C. To gain insights into the HER mechanism of Pt/HPC and commercial Pt/C, Tafel slope has been calculated from Tafel plot. It gives the relationship between overpotential and log (ǀjǀ) and the linear portion of the Tafel plot fits well to the Tafel equation: η = a + b l o g j , where η is the overpotential, j is the current density and b is the Tafel slope. Theoretically, b should have the approximate value of 30, 40 and 120 mV dec−1 for Tafel, Heyrovsky and Volmer steps, respectively [55]. Fig. 3b shows the Tafel plots of Pt/HPC-14.1 and commercial Pt/C. The Tafel slopes are calculated as 33 and 32 mV dec−1 respectively, suggesting that the hydrogen evolution process is achieved via the combination of two adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the electrode surface to form molecular hydrogen (Volmer-Tafel mechanism) [57]. The Tafel plots of Pt/HPC with different Pt loadings are compared in Fig. S7b. The CV curves of Pt/HPC-14.1 and commercial Pt/C (shown in Fig. S10) exhibit a symmetrical peak derived from the reversible H adsorption and desorption on electrode surface respectively while the curve of HPC shows no obvious peak. The active surface areas of catalysts are estimated using the H underpotential deposition (UPD) adsorption charge QH (striped area in the inset of Fig. S10) divided by 210 μC cm−2 (H adsorption charge per unit area of Pt-based catalysts) [58,59]. Accordingly, the active surface area of Pt/HPC-14.1 is estimated as 0.281 which is close to that of commercial Pt/C (0.271), suggesting a similar H adsorption capacity. Besides, Table S2 shows that the Pt loading on electrode of Pt/HPC-14.1 (14.0 μg cm−2) is much lower than that of the commercial Pt/C (19.8 μg cm−2). The mass activity calculated from the catalyst loading and the measured current density at η = 24 mV is 0.71 A mgPt −1 for Pt/HPC-14.1 which is about 4.4 times of that of commercial Pt/C (0.16 A mgPt −1). At the same time, the turnover frequency (TOF) is calculated to be 0.084 s−1 and 0.051 s−1 for Pt/HPC-14.1 and the commercial Pt/C, respectively (see the Supporting Information for calculation details). These results obviously indicate that Pt/HPC-14.1 shows much higher catalytic performance with lower Pt content than the commercial Pt/C. To study the properties of the solid-liquid interface, the EIS tests are carried out at −0.03 V in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. The Nyquist plots of HPC, Pt/HPC-14.1 and commercial Pt/C are given in Fig. 3c, in which the curvature indicates the charge transfer resistance. Generally, the smaller arc radius means the smaller charge transfer resistance and the faster charge transportation from electrode to electrolyte [60]. Herein, the experimental data are fitted with an equivalent circuit shown as the inset of Fig. 3c, where the R1, R2 is the solution resistance and the charge transfer resistance respectively and the fitting results are summarized in Table 2 . It shows clearly that the charge transfer resistance (R2) of Pt/HPC-14.1 (4.80 Ω) is close to that of the commercial Pt/C (3.79 Ω) but is far less than that of HPC (145.70 Ω), which suggests an outstanding catalytic property of Pt/HPC-14.1. The Nyquist plots of all samples are shown in Fig. S9d. The long-term durability of Pt/HPC-14.1 is tested via cyclic potential sweeping for 2000 cycles. As shown in Fig. 3d, there is 1.6 mV increasing after 2000 cycles for Pt/HPC-14.1 at the current density of −10 mA cm−2, indicating a good stability of Pt/HPC-14.1. The same conclusion could also be drawn from the chronoamperometric response shown in the inset of Fig. 3d. Table S3 summarizes the HER catalytic results of Pt/HPC-14.1 and the earlier reported Pt based HER catalysts in acid electrolyte. It is evident that Pt/HPC-14.1 manifests a superior catalytic activity and shows a great potential to substitute commercial Pt/C as common-used HER catalyst."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, the HPC prepared by the “bread leavening method” is used as catalyst support to replace CB in commercial Pt based HER catalyst. The large specific surface area, abundant oxygen-containing functional groups and defect sites endow HPC excellent behavior for the anchoring and dispersion of the Pt nanoparticles, and thus the improvement of the HER catalytic performance. These results suggest that the HPC is a competitive candidate as support for catalysts and the Pt/HPC with high HER catalytic activity has enormous potential to be an ideal substitution for the commercial Pt/C to catalyze the electrochemical water splitting."
