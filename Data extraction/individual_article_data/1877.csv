0,Introduction,"Increased fossil fuel consumption, coupled with both increasing awareness of environmental implications and diminishing natural resources, have provided the impetus to try and derive cleaner, quieter and more efficient sources of energy [1]. Utilizing hydrogen is one of the most promising approaches, with no emissions with the exception of water [2] and the capacity to be used in fuel cells [3]. One hydrogen source is steam reforming (SR) of hydrocarbons [4,5] and alcohols [6–8] among which propane is an attractive option as it is a primary constituent of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) [9,10], produced in relative high amounts from natural gas and oil crude refining, it also has the benefit that it can be easily stored and distributed in a liquid state at 9 bar [11,12]. Catalyst development has been the principal focus of SR research of propane. Up to the present various catalysts were studied in propane SR, including noble metal-based [5,10,13–15] and nickel-based catalysts [16–18]. The direct utilization of the synthesis gas produced by SR for energy production, however, is a particular problem, with high CO2 content negatively impacting upon efficiency of the proton exchange membranes fuel cells (PEMFC) system and high CO content possessing a strong poisoning effects upon the catalyst of PEMFC [19]. In terms of fuel cell applications, a CO concentration of less than 10 ppm is required for low temperature PEMFC and alkaline fuel cells [20]. Separating the hydrogen from a hydrogen rich gas with impurities, however, is financially costly [21,22]. In order to solve these problems and enhance the hydrogen concentration in the product gas, the concept of sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) was proposed, which combines SR with in situ removal of CO2 using a CO2 sorbent [23–26]. The idea of SESR is based on Le Chatelier’s principle, in which the reaction equilibrium will be shifted in favour of the reactant conversion, upon in situ removal of any of the products [24,27,28]. Such SESR approaches have been successfully applied in hydrogen production from biomass, methane, ethanol and glycerol [23–30]. To our knowledge, SESR has yet to be investigated for hydrogen production from propane. This work therefore seeks to understand, from a thermodynamic perspective, whether SESR can promote (and to what extent) the capacity of hydrogen production from propane SR. Theoretical analysis can provide a set of operating parameters to maximize the hydrogen production and/or propane conversion, through which, further experimental work can be guided. In this study, we performed thermodynamic analysis of SESR of propane, where total Gibbs free energy minimization method was employed to calculate equilibrium compositions. The effects of process variables such as pressure, temperature and water to propane ratio (WPR) were studied and the carbon formation in SESR of propane was also illustrated. The promising potential for high purity hydrogen production by SESR of propane is for the first time shown here."
1,Methodology,"The method of thermodynamic analysis by minimization of Gibbs free energy was introduced in our prior publications [7,31,32] and was also introduced in detail by other groups [28,33,34]. At low pressure and high temperature, the system can be considered as ideal [6,7]. The total Gibbs function for a system is given as follows: (1) G t = ∑ i = 1 N n i G ¯ i = ∑ i = 1 N n i μ ¯ i = ∑ n i G i 0 + R T ∑ n i ln f i ˆ f i 0 For reaction equilibria in gas phase, f i ∧ = ϕ i ∧ y i P , f i 0 = P 0 , and since G i 0 is set equal to zero for each chemical element in its standard state, Δ G 0 = Δ G f i 0 for each component is assumed. The minimum Gibbs free energy of each gaseous species and that of the total system can be expressed as Eqs. (2) and (3), with the Lagrange’s undetermined multiplier method. (2) Δ G f i 0 + R T ln ϕ i ˆ y i p p 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k = 0 (3) ∑ i = 1 N n i ( Δ G f i 0 + R T ln ϕ i ˆ y i p p 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k ) = 0 With the constraints of elemental balances: (4) ∑ i = 1 N n i a i k = A k When solid is considered in the system, Eq. (5) is used in the calculations. (5) n s Δ G f s 0 = 0 The primary species involved in propane SR are C3H8, H2O, H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and carbon (graphite). The most occurring products, including H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and carbon [5,10,35], were discussed in this work. Calcium oxide (CaO) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) were also involved when CaO was used as a CO2 sorbent. The thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were accomplished with the use of Outokumpu HSC Chemistry 4.0, a chemical reaction and equilibrium software, using the extensive thermochemical database delivered in the software package [36]. Gibbs module of this software is usually used to directly calculate product compositions at equilibrium employing the total Gibbs free energy minimization method. The initial amount of propane was assumed to be 1 mol with/without 3 mol of CaO in the system, therefore mole yield of each product presented in this study is based on per mole of propane. Thermodynamic analysis was carried out over the following variable ranges: pressure 1–5 atm, temperature 700–1100 K and WPR 1–18."
2,Results and discussion,"Complete conversion of propane by the SR process was achieved for the range of pressure, temperature and WPR considered in this study, irrespective of the CO2 sorbent CaO."
3,Hydrogen production,"3.1 Hydrogen production For both SR and SESR, the number of moles of hydrogen decreases with an increase in pressure as shown in Fig. 1 which depicts moles of hydrogen produced per mole of propane from SR and SESR of propane at selected pressures and WPR = 6. This is attributed to the overall reaction of propane SR, in which number of moles increases during the reaction (see Eq. (6)). Apparently, low pressure favours the reaction and high pressure has a detrimental effect on hydrogen production. We therefore selected atmospheric pressure (best one in terms of hydrogen production) throughout the following discussion. In addition to the effect of pressure, Fig. 1 provides the first indication that, in general, more hydrogen can be produced from SESR than SR at the same temperature and WPR. (6) C 3 H 8 + 6 H 2 O ↔ 3 CO 2 + 10 H 2 Δ H 298 K = 373.7 kJ / mol Fig. 2 illustrates moles of hydrogen produced per mole of propane as a function of WPR and temperature at atmospheric pressure. As seen from Fig. 2A, the number of moles of hydrogen increases with increasing temperature when WPR is less than 6 in SR. For a given WPR (>6), however, hydrogen production increases as temperature increases, before reaching a maximum at around 925–975 K and then begins to decrease slightly at higher temperatures. The greatest quantity of hydrogen (9.1 mol) is produced at 925 K with a WPR of 18. Moles of hydrogen increase steadily with increasing WPR. Although high WPR enhances the reforming performance significantly, it is believed that higher WPRs require higher reactor volume because of higher steam volumetric flow, and consume higher input heat duty because of higher vaporization energy. As the benefit in terms of hydrogen production from an increase in WPR from 12 to 18 is marginal, the optimum condition for hydrogen production is, therefore, a WPR of 12 at approximately 950 K and atmospheric pressure. When propane SR is coupled with in situ CO2 capture using CaO, the following reaction takes place. (7) CaO + CO 2 ↔ CaCO 3 Δ H 298 K = − 178.8 kJ / mol One of the advantages of conducting SR with the presence of CaO is that the heat generated by Eq. (7) can drive the reforming reactions, which improves the efficiency of high purity hydrogen production. The moles of hydrogen produced from SESR of propane are shown in Fig. 2B. For a given WPR (<6), the number of moles of hydrogen increases with increasing temperature. When WPR is greater than 6, moles of hydrogen produced from SESR, however, are relatively stable between 700 and 900 K and then decrease with a further increase in temperature. A likely rationale for this observation is the deactivation of the CaO sorbent. The second probable reason is due to the high reaction temperature suppressing the proceeding of water gas shift reaction (WGSR), which can be supported by the increase amount of CO and H2O (not shown) when the temperature is above 900 K. As shown in Fig. 3 , the moles of CaCO3 formed in the reaction decrease from close to 3 mol (theoretical value) to zero with an increase in temperature from approximately 850 to 1025 K. This is believed to occur due to the higher reaction temperatures favouring the endothermic decomposition of CaCO3, according to Eq. (7) [29,37]. It is also noteworthy that at low WPRs (i.e. 1, 3 and 6), the production of CO2 is limited by the steam available for SR of propane, therefore the formation of CaCO3 is significantly lower. CaCO3 cannot be formed at all when the temperature is greater than 1025 K. The production of hydrogen from SESR tends to be the same with that of SR over 1025 K (as shown in Fig. 2A). It is apparent that high WPRs are more favourable for hydrogen production from SESR. In general, due to the possible drawbacks of higher WPRs mentioned previously, a WPR of 12 at around 825 K is suitable for hydrogen production from SESR of propane. One of the advantages of SESR of propane is that high purity of hydrogen can be achieved. Products compositions as a function of temperature at atmospheric pressure and WPR = 12 are presented in Fig. 4 . Without the presence of CaO, hydrogen and CO concentrations increase with temperature, whereas the concentrations of CO2 and CH4 decrease (see Fig. 4A). The relative concentration of hydrogen reaches peaks and tends to be stable over 900 K. However, the highest hydrogen concentration of the product gas from propane SR is only 74% (obtained at 950 K) which is far below the basic requirement of hydrogen purity for PEMFC. However, the addition of CaO in the system can increase hydrogen purity dramatically. As shown in Fig. 4B, hydrogen purities are over 99% below 900 K. Furthermore, almost no CO2 or CO is produced with the only impurity being CH4. Hydrogen concentration, however, declines rapidly between 900 K and 1025 K due to the decomposition of CaCO3. Comas et al. have reported a thermodynamic analysis of ethanol steam reforming using CaO as a CO2 sorbent [23]. Our results are in noticeably good agreement with theirs in terms of hydrogen production trends and the behaviour of CaO in the system. It can be seen that SESR greatly diminishes the CO concentration."
4,Methane production,"3.2 Methane production For hydrogen production, CH4 is not a desirable product as the production of CH4 competes with hydrogen generation [31]. Fig. 5 A describes moles of CH4 produced from SR of propane as a function of WPR and temperature at atmospheric pressure. Generally, moles of CH4 decrease with the increase in both temperature and WPR. High temperatures and WPRs, which are suitable for hydrogen production, can also inhibit the production of CH4. At temperatures >950 K with WPRs more than 12, this product is almost entirely inhibited. In the case of SESR, the number of moles of CH4 increases with decreasing temperature and WPR. Compared with SR, the production of CH4 can be substantially reduced below 900 K with a WPR more than 9 (see Fig. 5B)."
5,Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide production,"3.3 Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide production Oxygenated compounds CO and CO2 are considered as impurities because they do not compete against H2 [38]. Formation of CO can damage the anode of PEMFC [32]. The inhibition of CO production was therefore studied in this work. Fig. 6 shows moles of CO produced per mole of propane as a function of WPR and temperature at atmospheric pressure. For a given WPR in SR, CO production increases as the temperature increases. This can be attributed to the exothermicity of WGSR, in which higher temperature has a detrimental effect on the conversion of CO [39]. High WPRs favour the production of CO when WPR is less than 6 (stoichiometric ratio), however, moles of CO decrease with a further increase in WPR (see Fig. 6A). In the case of SESR as shown in Fig. 6B, a similar pattern is observed, in which high temperatures again favour CO generation whereas high WPRs favour the inhibition of CO production. Almost no CO is produced when temperature is below 850 K regardless of the WPR. For a given WPR in SR, the amount of CO2 produced at equilibrium increases with an increase in temperature until a peak temperature, and after the peak occurs, there is a declining trend with further increasing temperature (see Fig. 7 A). Similar to the trends of hydrogen production, a higher WPR also favours the production of CO2. In SESR, CaO serves as a CO2 sorbent to react with gas phase CO2 and form CaCO3 according to Eq. (7). As shown in Fig. 7B, therefore, there is hardly any CO2 produced below 850 K above which CO2 production increases with increasing temperature until that CO2 is unable to be adsorbed (around 1025 K) before declining. This is consistent with the production of CaCO3 mentioned previously, no CaCO3 can be formed above 1025 K. Due to the aforementioned difficulties in producing CaCO3 at high temperatures, CaCO3 formation is limited, leading to similar production of hydrogen, CH4, CO and CO2 as that observed in SR."
6,Carbon formation,"3.4 Carbon formation The existence of carbon can poison catalysts in reforming reactions [40]. Thus carbon formation is an important aspect of analysis. As can be seen from Fig. 8 , high WPRs favour the inhibition of carbon formation in both SESR and SR of propane and a WPR of 6 is enough to avoid carbon production throughout the temperature range considered in this study. SESR has the advantage over SR with decreased carbon formation at low temperatures for WPR = 1 and 3. However, at high temperatures as the production of other species, SESR shows the same trend as SR above the highest temperature that CO2 can be adsorbed. For Both SESR and SR of propane, at steam lean conditions (i.e. WPR ≤ 3), there is an increasing trend for carbon formation, which is in contrast from the SR of ethanol [7,23] and glycerol [8,28,38] where higher temperatures have a detrimental effect on carbon production regardless of the water to reactant ratio. This variation is conceivably due to the oxygen available in alcohol molecules which help to inhibit carbon formation."
7,Conclusion,"Thermodynamic features of SR and SESR of propane have been investigated with the method of Gibbs free energy minimization. The effects of pressure, temperature and WPR on the reforming reactions and carbon formation are examined. Atmospheric pressure and a WPR of 12 are feasible for hydrogen production from both SR and SESR of propane. The most favourable temperature for propane SR is approximately 950 K and a maximum of 9.1 mol hydrogen per mole of propane can be produced. However, the optimum temperature for SESR is around 825 K, which is over 100 K lower than that for SR. The use of CaO as a CO2 sorbent in situ can substantially enhance hydrogen production compared with SR, as nearly 10 mol (stoichiometric value) of hydrogen per mole of propane can be obtained even at 700 K due to the CO2 adsorption. The highest hydrogen concentration from propane SR is only 74% (achieved at 950 K), which is far from the basic requirement of hydrogen purity for PEMFC. Hydrogen purities, however, are over 99% below 900 K in SESR. Furthermore, almost no CO2 or CO is produced with the only impurity being CH4. High WPR is favourable to inhibit carbon formation. The minimum WPR required to eliminate carbon production is 6 in both SR and SESR. The results show that hydrogen production from SESR of propane should be a promising direction."
