0,Introduction,"Tandem catalysis, executing multiple consecutive reactions (e.g. hydrogenation-alkylation, cycloaddition-aldol) in one catalytic process, has been attracted great significance due to its economize on the energy, materials and process time [1–4]. Among them, tandem catalytic functionalization of nitroarenes with primary alcohols and/or aldehyde has regarded as a vital reaction due to its social and economic perspectives. Because the hydrogenation/N-alkylation intermediates and/or products (e.g. aniline, N-ethylaniline, N,N-diethylaniline) are significant fine chemicals for the production of agrochemicals, polymers and dyes and so on [5–9]. Recently, numerous of heterogeneous catalysts, especially for the metal-oxide/carbon–nitrogen (CN) supported catalysts (Ni/CeO2, Co@CN, Fe-Fe3C-LaOCl/CN, etc), have been applied for the tandem reaction due to their unique interfacial structures [10–15]. The incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) is a classic method for the preparation of supported catalysts due to its easy and facile operations. However, for most of supported catalysts prepared by the IWI method have the poor dispersity and weak metal-support interaction, which further led to the migration and/or agglomeration of active nanoparticles during the catalytic process [13,16]. Therefore, a plenty of strategies including as soft/hard template, multi-metal alloy and dual confinement have been adopted to synthesis of highly efficient catalysts with high dispersity and SMSI for the various catalytic reactions [17–27]. However, take the hard template for instance, the multi-step preparation procedures may cause the collapse of partial pore structure contained in the prepared catalysts [28–30]. Therefore, it’s highly desirable to develop an easy and feasible strategy for preparation of efficient supported catalysts with specific properties for the heterogeneous reactions. Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and/or coordination polymers (CPs) has been regarded as promising candidates for the synthesis of highly efficient metal-oxide/carbon–nitrogen supported catalysts employed for the various catalytic reactions due to their well-defined structure could control and integrate the diverse functionalities including as distribution/size of active species, and/or catalyst composition in one preparation step [31–35]. However, the loadings/types of active species contained in the prepared supported catalysts derived from the direct pyrolysis of MOFs-only precursors are uncontrollable [36,37]. The post-synthetic metalation (PSM) is an alternative method for the synthesis of multivariate metal–organic frameworks (MTV-MOFs) derived supported catalysts with tunable active sites and catalytic features (e.g. particle size, metal-support interaction) [13,16,38]. Among the strategies towards preparation of MTV-MOFs and their derived catalysts, the “metalloligand” strategy, incorporated CPs and/or organometallic polymers (OPs) with “free” donor groups for further other metal binding, has been proven effective in synthesizing specific MTV-MOFs with unique physicochemical properties [13,16,39,40]. Therefore, it’s highly desirable to fabricate a well-defined and low-cost metalloligand, allowing for coordinating with other active transition-metal ions (e.g. Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+) for the synthesis of MTV-MOFs derived carbon–nitrogen supported catalysts for the heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Herein, as illustrated in Scheme 1 , hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) and acetate acted as the organic and metallic crosslinkers, respectively, coordinating to Zn2+ ions forming a well-defined two-dimensional (2D) MOFs metalloligand (termed Zn-HMTA), with free uncoordinated tertiary amine groups, has been synthesized through solution diffusion method (b). The abundantly free tertiary amine groups contained in HMTA have excellent coordination ability with transition Co2+ ions (named as Co@Zn-HMTA) via an interaction between the d-orbitals of transition-metal atoms and lone pair electron of nitrogen atoms contained in HMTA organic linker. Furthermore, the Co@Zn-HMTA MOFs was pyrolysed in Ar atmosphere at different temperature to obtain the optimized catalyst (termed as Co-ZnO@CN-CAI) and applied for the tandem catalytic nitroarenes with primary alcohols."

7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of the two-dimensional Zn-HMTA and Co@Zn-HMTA MOFs.,"3.1 Characterization of the two-dimensional Zn-HMTA and Co@Zn-HMTA MOFs. The single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis was conducted on the two-dimensional Zn-HMTA MOFs. As shown in Fig. 1 , the single crystal structure of Zn-HMTA MOFs was solved in the cubic space group with a lattice parameter of a = 21.474 Å (Table S1), in which hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) organic linker acts as a bridge through two out of the four nitrogen atoms to connect the two Zn atoms {Zn2(HMTA)}, and the neighboring {Zn2(HMTA)} is connected through two oxygen atoms from carboxylato groups (Fig. 1a). Notably, the Zn atoms contained in Zn-HMTA MOFs are crystallographically equivalent, and each Zn2+ ion is coordinated to one nitrogen atom contained HMTA organic linker, while two uncoordinated nitrogen atoms located at the Zn2(HMTA) unit are left (Fig. 1b). The most interesting feature of the crystal structure towards Zn-HMTA MOFs is that the HMTA and acetic acid organic linkers are connected by the binuclear Zn2(HMTA) to form the sheet-type structure (Fig. 1c), which in turn stacks together to give the two-dimensional frameworks (Fig. 1d, 1e). Moreover, the PXRD pattern of the as-synthesized Zn-HMTA MOFs is well in accordance with that of simulated pattern (Fig. S1), suggesting that the crystalline Zn-HMTA MOFs is homogenous. The overall synthetic strategy of Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst derived from the polymers towards the two-dimensional (2D) Zn-HMTA MOFs coordination with Co2+ is illustrated in Scheme 1. The as-synthesized Zn-HMTA MOFs (Scheme 1a, 1b) was dissolved into the methanol solution, which further metalated with methanol solution of Co(OAC)2 · 4H2O under vigorous stirring at room temperature. Before catalytic hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction between the nitroarenes and alcohol, the Co@Zn-HMTA MOFs was one-pot pyrolyzed in Ar atmosphere to afford Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst (Scheme 1c). The high-yield syntheses of Co@Zn-HMTA MOFs under mild reaction conditions due to metalloligand of Zn-HMTA MOFs had abundantly free tertiary amine groups, which can facilitate the transition metal ions (e.g. Ni2+, Co2+) adsorption within 2D layers via coordination interaction between d-orbitals of Co atom and lone pair electron of N atoms located at the skeleton of the HMTA ligand (Scheme 1b). Furthermore, HAADF-STEM was employed to confirm that the introduction of Co2+ ions contained in Co@Zn-HMTA MOFs via the coordination method as well their distribution on the framework of Zn-HMTA MOFs. As shown in Fig. S2, the observable element of Co uniformly distributes on the surface of the Co@Zn-HMTA MOFs, indicating that the occurrence of coordination interaction between free tertiary amine groups contained in Zn-HMTA MOFs and Co2+ ions, which will be confirmed by the following 1H→13C CP/MAS NMR, XPS and FT-IR experiments. It should be noted that this CAI method by employing coordination interaction between d-orbitals of Co atom and lone pair electron of N atoms located at the skeleton of the HMTA ligand could improve the content of N species and efficiently strengthen the Co-support interaction as well as suppress the aggregation of active Co species during the reaction process. The 1H→13C CP/MAS NMR, XPS and FT-IR experiments were further conducted to investigate the coordination interaction between Zn-HMTA MOFs and Co2+ ions. As depicted in Fig. 2 a, the chemical shift located at ∼ 74 ppm was assigned to tertiary amine groups contained in HMTA organic linker. The broadened full width at half maximum (FWHM) and successively down-shift of chemical shift (74.1 → 73.7 → 73.4) towards the HMTA, Zn-HMTA, and Co@Zn-HMTA samples suggested that the continuous coordination interaction between the Zn(OAC)2 · 2H2O and Co(OAC)2 · 4H2O and tertiary amine groups contained in HMTA organic linker [41]. The C 1s and N 1s XPS analysis were also performed to reveal the interaction between the Co2+ ion and Zn-HMTA MOFs. As shown in Fig. 2b, for Zn-HMTA and Co@Zn-HMTA MOFs, the peak located at 286. eV was assigned to the C-N., As for Co@Zn-HMTA MOFs, the intensity of C-N peak obvious decreased after coordinated with Co2+ ions in comparison to that of in pristine Zn-HMTA MOFs, supporting that the occurrence of interaction between the Co2+ ions and free tertiary amine groups located at HMTA organic linker [42,43]. Moreover, compared with Zn-HMTA, a new peak appeared at 399.4 eV can be probably attributed to tertiary amine groups coordinated with Co2+ ions forming Co-N- bonding mode (Fig. 2c), which is consistent with above C 1s analysis [8]. In addition, the interaction of Co2+ ions with free tertiary amine groups contained in Zn-HMTA was further confirmed by FT-IR (Fig. 2d). For Zn-HMTA, the bands at 680 and 823 cm−1 are ascribed to the N-C-N bend and C-N stretching vibration, respectively [44]. However, for Co@Zn-HMTA, the bands assigning to N-C-N bend and C-N stretching vibration splited into two peaks (820 and 816 cm−1, 678 and 675 cm−1, respectively) and shifted to lower bands, suggesting that the strong interaction between the Zn-HMTA and Co2+ ions, which is consistent with above 1H→13C CP/MAS NMR and XPS analyses [39]."
9,Catalytic performance of the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalysts prepared by different pyrolysis temperature.,"3.2 Catalytic performance of the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalysts prepared by different pyrolysis temperature. The as-synthesized Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst was applied for the tandem catalytic nitroarenes with ethanol reaction. Firstly, the optimized experiments towards nitrobenzene reacted with ethanol at different reaction temperature, amount of catalyst, solvent, reaction time catalyzed by the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst were conducted, the detailed investigations were provided into Supporting Information (Fig. S3). Based on the previous reported investigations [45,46], the pyrolysis temperature of MOFs materials, especially for the Zn containing MOFs, has a significant effect on the features of the final catalysts and their performance for catalytic reactions. Furthermore, the catalytic performance of Co@Zn-HMTA MOFs pyrolyzed with different temperature (450, 550, 650 and 750 °C, for convenience, the prepared catalysts termed as Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-450, Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-550, Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-650 and Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-750, respectively) for hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction was investigated. As depicted in Fig. 3 , for Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-450 catalyst, the nitrobenzene conversion is 53.8%, and aniline and N-ethylaniline selectivities are 90.0% and 10.0%, respectively. When the pyrolysis temperatures ranged from 450 to 550 °C, the nitrobenzene was fully converted into aniline, and the N-ethylaniline selectivity increased from 10.0 to 62% catalyzed by the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-550. Interestingly, upon further increment in pyrolysis temperature to 650 °C, for tandem catalytic process catalyzed by Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-650, the N-ethylaniline selectivity increased from 62.0 to 87.0%, and the selectivity to N,N-diethylaniline was 13.0%, respectively. However, when the pyrolysis temperature increased to 750 °C, the prepared Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-750 catalyst exhibited decreased selectivities (52.3% aniline and 47.7 % N-ethylaniline, respectively) in comparison with those of Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-650 catalyst. All of which suggested that the pyrolysis temperatures towards Co@Zn-HMTA have significant effect on the catalytic performance of their derived catalysts pyrolyzed at different temperatures. Therefore, the HADDF-STEM, XRD, Raman and XPS characterizations were conducted to investigate the difference in the catalytic performance for hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction catalyzed by Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-Tp catalysts. Firstly, the morphologies of catalysts, size of Co nanoparticle, crystal lattice, as well as of distributions of Co, Zn elements on the surface of the as-prepared catalysts were investigated by using TEM and HADDF-STEM-Mapping characterizations (Fig. 4 ). From the HRTEM images (Fig. 4a2-d2), it can be observed that these nanoparticles have well-resolved lattice fringes with interspacing of 0.20 and 0.26 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of metallic Co and (002) plane of ZnO, respectively [8,47]. Among the TEM images of four catalysts (Fig. 4a1-d1), the formed Co species on Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-650 catalyst were the most homogenously embedded in the carbon＆ZnO matrix without obvious aggregation. Moreover, the corresponding size distributions towards the four catalysts have revealed that average diameter of the Co nanoparticles gradually decreased from 29.2 to 18.2 nm with increasing pyrolysis temperature from 450 to 650 °C, which is consistent with following XRD analysis. For Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-750, the Co species tended to intertwine to generate larger aggregates (average diameter of the Co nanoparticles was 28.5 nm), which will be confirmed by the following HADDF-STEM-Mapping analysis. The HADDF-STEM-Mapping analysis indicated that the formed Co species contained in Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-650 catalyst exhibited a solid spherical structure with the most uniform distribution in comparison with those on the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-T p (T p = 450, 550 and 750 °C) catalysts, which is consistent with above catalytic performance results. Based on previous reported investigations [45,48], the pyrolysis temperature also played a vital role in improving the crystallinity of the MOFs materials. Therefore, the crystalline structures of the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-T p (T p = 450, 550, 650 and 750 °C) catalysts were investigated by the XRD analysis. As depicted in Fig. 5 a, it can be observed that an obvious change in crystalline structure of derived catalysts as a result of increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 450 to 750 °C. Notably, in comparison with the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-750 catalyst, no XRD peaks of CoO-ZnO composite are observed in Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-T p (T p = 450, 550 and 650 °C) catalysts after pyrolysis process, indicating that the suitable pyrolysis temperature could achieve the Co2+/Co3+→Co0 process, which is consistent with above TEM analysis. From the enlarged section (Fig. 5a inset), the peaks intensity of cobalt species decreased with the increasing of pyrolysis temperature due to that cobalt species contained in CoO-ZnO composite with SMSI are difficult to reduce to the metallic Co without extra reduction process when the pyrolyzed temperature increased from 650 to 750 °C. The characteristic peaks of Co species (located at ∼ 44°) contained in Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-T p (T p = 650 and 750 °C) catalysts, especially for Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-750 shifted to the low 2θ values compared with that of metallic Co, indicating that the larger ionic radius of N3– (1.46 Å) atoms incorporated into the lattice of Co atoms (0.74 Å) to form the Co-N species or Co3ZnC alloy, suggesting that high pyrolysis temperature could strengthen the metal–metal/support interaction [8,45]. Likewise, the similar trend was observed in the characteristic peaks ZnO species contained Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-T p (T p = 650 and 750 °C) catalysts, suggesting that high pyrolysis temperature resulted in generating more CoOx-ZnO composite. Moreover, a new extra peak appeared at 42.1° in Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-750 catalyst which was attributed to the presence of CoOx-ZnO composite [49,50]. Notably, the diffractions intensity of ZnO phases in Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-T p (T p = 450, 550, 650 and 750 °C) catalysts decreased and peak position shifted to higher 2θ values when the pyrolyzed temperature increased from 550 to 750 °C (Fig. 5a inset) ascribed to the increasing the high pyrolysis temperature resulted in evaporation of Zn species contained in CoO-ZnO composite. The Raman analysis was further conducted to support the formation of graphitized carbon in the prepared catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5b, the peaks located at ∼ 1360 and ∼ 1590 cm−1 were assigned to the A1g mode (D band) and first-order scattering of the E2g (G band) vibrational mode of graphite, respectively [51]. Notably, the increased ratios of I D/I G (0.93 → 0.95 → 0.96) as the pyrolysis temperature increased from the 450 to 650 °C, suggesting that high pyrolysis temperature facilitates the generation of more graphitic nitrogen from decomposition of Co@Zn-HMTA MOFs. The formation of graphitic nitrogen can effectively facilitate the charge transfer and improve the catalytic performance during the tandem reaction process [45]. For Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-750, the D and G bands of carbon were not observed due to its low content, which is confirmed by the CHN analysis (Table 1 ). Furthermore, the surface states of the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-T p (T p = 450, 550, 650 and 750 °C) catalysts were evaluated by XPS, and the quantitatively analyzed results were listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 5c, for four catalysts, the deconvoluted peaks located at 778.9, 779.5, and 781.9 eV are assigned to the Co0, Co3+ and Co2+, respectively [52]. The presence of oxidation state of cobalt (Co3+ and Co2+) in Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-T p (T p = 450, 550 and 650 °C) was due to the catalysts exposured to the air before the XPS experiments. Notably, the presence of obvious peaks in four catalysts located at 780.3 eV were corresponded to the Co-N species resulted from the strong interaction between the metallic Co and nitrogen atoms. The generated Co-N species could efficiently improve the dispersion of cobalt species and supress their agglomeration and mobility [53]. The as-formed Co-N species in four catalysts were further confirmed by the N 1s XPS, and the analyzed results were listed in Table 1. As depicted in Fig. 5d, the peaks located at 398.3 400.2 and 401.0 eV are attributed to the pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic N, respectively. Moreover, an obvious resolved peak located at 399.4 eV ascribed to the generated Co-N species, which is consistent with above Co 2p3/2 XPS analysis [54–56]. From the Table 1, the percentages of surface N species and generated Co-N species contained in four Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-T p (T p = 450, 550, 650 and 750 °C) catalysts decreased as the pyrolysis temperature increased from the 450 to 750 °C (4.7% → 4.2% → 2.5%→ 0.7%, and 2.4% → 11.3% → 16.7%→ 6.6%, respectively), suggesting that high pyrolysis temperature results in the loss the nitrogen species and the suitable pyrolysis temperature facilitates the formation of the Co-N species. The prepared catalysts with higher percentage of Co-N species makes for the improving the catalytic performance for the hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction process. Moreover, the contents of carbon and nitrogen contained in as-prepared Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-T p (T p = 450, 550, 650 and 750 °C) catalysts were also analyzed by the CHN characterization. From the results of CHN (Table 1), it also can be observed that the increase of pyrolysis temperature led to the rapid decrease of contents of carbon and nitrogen species, which is consistent with XPS analysis. It is also responsible for weak peaks intensities of Raman (Fig. 5b) and N 1s XPS (Fig. 5d) towards the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-750 catalyst."
10,Catalytic performance of the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI and Co-ZnO@CN-IWI catalysts.,"3.3 Catalytic performance of the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI and Co-ZnO@CN-IWI catalysts. Based on the catalytic performance of above prepared Co-ZnO@CN-CAI-T p (T p = 450, 550, 650 and 750 °C) catalysts, it can be observed that Co@ZnO-CN-CAI-650 (pyrolysis temperature at 650 °C) exhibited the most active for the hydrogenation-alkylation tandem process. The origin of enhanced performance of Co@ZnO-CN-CAI-650 among the four catalysts for hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction was attributed to the suitable pyrolysis temperature (650 °C) could efficiently decrease size of the metallic Co and increase content of Co-N species, strengthen the Co-support interaction, generate more graphitic nitrogen and facilitate the charge transfer. Furthermore, we also investigate the advantages of developed catalyst prepared by the strategy of coordination-assisted impregnation (Co-ZnO@CN-CAI) in comparison to that classic catalyst prepared by the IWI method (Co-ZnO@CN-IWI). The contents of Co and Zn species contained in two catalysts were determined by the ICP analysis. As depicted in Table S2, the mass and molar contents of metallic Co contained in Co-ZnO@CN-CAI (10.2% and 10.7 mol%, respectively) and Co/ZnO-CN-IWI (11.3% and 11.9 mol%, respectively) suggested that the hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction catalyzed by the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI and Co/ZnO-CN-IWI catalysts is catalytic, not metal mediated. Fig. 6 a shows the catalytic activities and selectivity of the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI and Co-ZnO@CN-IWI catalysts for the hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction. It is obvious observed that the preparation methods have significant effect on the catalytic performance. Although all the two catalysts exhibited 100% nitrobenzene conversion, the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst prepared by the coordination-assisted strategy delivers 87 % N-ethylaniline as well as 13 % N,N-diethylaniline selectivities in comparison with those in Co-ZnO@CN-IWI (47.7/52.3% for aniline/N-ethylaniline, respectively) under the same reaction conditions. Furthermore, the intrinsic kinetics of nitrobenzene-alkylation tandem reaction, the control experiment was conducted to confirm rate-determined step by employing the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst. As shown in Fig. 6b, the concentration–time kinetic profiles of sequential reaction process exhibited that hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline in the beginning 12 min, and the alkylation of aniline with ethanol to N-ethylaniline proceeds simultaneously at the 10 min. After that, the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyzes the alkylation of aniline to N-ethylaniline in the following 168 min, and then the N-alkylation of N-ethylaniline with ethanol to N,N-diethylaniline proceeded in the following 120 min. Moreover, the comparison of catalytic performance of Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst for tandem reaction between nitrobenzene and ethanol, and N-alkylation reaction between aniline and ethanol was investigated. For the catalytic process towards N-alkylation reaction between aniline and ethanol, the developed could catalyze the aniline reacted with ethanol to formation of N-ethylaniline under the 130 °C, and the catalytic selectivity of N-ethylaniline (42.0%) was slightly higher than that obtained from the tandem reaction between nitrobenzene and ethanol (36.8%) (Fig. S4). In addition, the comparison experiments were conducted to identify that the Co species were the main active sites contained in the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst rather than ZnO (Fig. S5). All of which confirm that alkylation of aniline with ethanol is the rate-determining step and the Co species were the main active sites in the tandem catalytic process. The morphologies and microstructures as well as the distribution of Zn and Co elements of as-synthesized Co-ZnO@CN-CAI and Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalysts were characterized by the FESEM, TEM and HADDF-STEM techniques (Fig. 7 ). From the SEM images (Fig. 7Aa, Ba), the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst exhibits massive structure with diameter ranging from several microns to several dozens of microns, and the Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalyst displays stacked-nanoparticles structure. Furthermore, the particle morphology, distribution of particle size, crystal lattice, as well as the elements distributions were examined by the TEM and HADDF-STEM analysis. The Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst (Fig. 7Ab) shows a relatively regular nanoparticle with a mean particle size of 18.2 nm (Fig. 7Ae) without obvious agglomeration in comparison with Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalyst (26.7 nm, Fig. 7Be) (Fig. 7Bb), suggesting that the CAI method could efficiently supress the agglomeration of nanocatalyst. Moreover, the particle size distribution, and metallic Co crystal lattice of Co-ZnO@CN-CAI and Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalysts were examined by the TEM and HADDF-STEM analysis. From the Fig. 7Ac and 7Bc, the lattice spacing values are 0.20 and 0.26 nm assigning to the (111) and (002) planes of the metallic Co and ZnO, respectively [47,54]. The representative HAADF-STEM analysis (Fig. 7Ad and 7Bd) revealed that the elements of Co and Zn contained in Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst were uniformly distributed on the ZnO@CN support in comparison with those on Co-ZnO/CN-IWI, suggesting that the CAI strategy could improve the dispersion of metal (Co and Zn) elements during the preparation process. In addition, from the EDS analysis (Fig. 7Af and Fig. 7Bf), the weight of Co specie on the surface of developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI (23.3%) is lower than on Co-ZnO/CN-IWI (41.4%), supporting that the CAI method could promote the distribution of Co specie, which is consistent with following SEM-EDS mapping analysis. The SEM-EDX/mapping analysis was conducted to investigate the distributions of Co, Zn, C, N and O elements on the surface of the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI and classic Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalysts. From the EDX and Mapping analysis in the two catalysts (Fig. S6), although the weights of Co and Zn species on the surface of developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI (20.5% and 46.8%, respectively) are lower than those of classic Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalyst (37.1% and 56.4%), the Co and Zn species on the surface of the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI exhibited more uniformly distributed than those on Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalyst. All of which suggested that the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst prepared by the CAI method could efficiently improve the dispersion of Co species. Fig. 8 a exhibits the XRD patterns of the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI and classic Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalysts. For the Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalyst, the diffraction peaks located at 45.4 and 51.4° are corresponded to the (111) and (200) crystalline facets of metallic Co (JCPDS No. 15–0806), respectively [57]. However, from the enlarged section, the peaks of metallic Co in developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst shift to the lower 2θ values. The possible reason for lattice cell expansion of metallic was ascribed to two aspects: 1) the smaller ionic radius of Co2+ ions (0.745 Å) being replaced by the larger ionic radius of N3– ions (1.46 Å) forming Co-N species, which is identified by the following the XPS analysis. 2) the ZnO species were incorporated into the lattice of metallic Co due to the SMSI, which is consistent with change towards up-shift of the ZnO diffraction peak (Fig. 8a, enlarged section) [58]. Based on the previous reports, the generated Co-N and strengthened Co-ZnO interaction are favourable for the enhancing the catalytic activity and supressing the aggregation of catalyst during the reaction process [8,9]. Meanwhile, we have known that the catalytic reaction rate of hydrogenation/alkylation is sensitive to the particle size of active species, therefore the crystalline sizes of Co species contained in two catalysts were calculated by the XRD patterns by using the Scherrer equation. As depicted in Table 2 , the crystalline size of metallic Co in developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI (17.9 nm) was obvious smaller than that of classic Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalyst (25.1 nm), which is consistent with above results of TEM and performance for hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction. Fig. 8b exhibits the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms together with the BJH pore size distributions as well as the results of specific surface area (S BET) of the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI and classic Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalysts. It can be observed that the isotherms of two catalysts show type IV isotherm curves with H3-type hysteresis loops (IUPAC classification) [59]. As depicted in Fig. 8b, the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI exhibits s slightly higher BET specific surface area (57.8 m2·g−1) than that of classic Co-ZnO/CN-IWI (56.1 m2·g−1) catalyst as well as similar Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions, suggesting that the BET specific surface area or BJH pore size distribution was not the main factor affecting the performance of as-synthesized catalysts for hydrogenation-alkylation reaction. Furthermore, the structural defects of the two catalysts were examined by the Raman analysis. As shown in Fig. 8c, for Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst, a well-documented D band peak (A 1g symmetry, located at 1336 cm−1) and a G band peak (E 2g symmetry, at ∼ 1593 cm−1) can be observed [51]. The relative ratio of D band to G band (I D/I G) for developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI was 0.96. However, for the classic Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalyst, there is no obvious D and G bands can be observed due to its low content of carbon species, which is consistent with above the CHN analysis (Table 2). Moreover, the surface states of the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI and classic Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalysts were examined by the XPS, and the analyzed results (contents of surface N and formed Co-N species) were listed in Table 2. As depicted in Fig. 8d, the Co spectra of two catalysts were resolved into two regions towards Co 2p3/2 (∼780 eV) and 2p1/2 (796 eV), respectively. Obviously, the peak at 780.3 eV is assigned to Co-N specie resulted from the metallic Co with nitrogen atom [52,53]. As shown in Table 2, the content of Co-N species in developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI (15.8 at%) is obviously higher than that in classic Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalyst (8.1 at%), which is confirmed by the following Co 2p XPS analysis. As shown in Fig. S7, the N 1s peak intensity for Co-ZnO@CN-CAI is higher than that of Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalyst due to its high content of nitrogen species (Table 2). From the two N 1s peaks, the resolved peaks located at 399.4 eV are ascribed to the Co-N species. Meanwhile, as shown in Table 2, the content of Co-N species contained in developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI (16.7 at%) is obviously higher than that of classic Co-ZnO/CN-IWI catalyst (7.0 at%), which is consistent with above Co 2p XPS analysis. Moreover, as depicted in Fig. S7, the N 1s peaks for two catalysts are further deconvoluted into three peaks (398, 400.2 and 401.0 eV, which are attributed to the pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic N, respectively) except for the Co-N. Notably, high contents of pyridinic-N and generated Co-N species could efficiently improve the dispersion of the Co species contained in the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI, which makes for the inhibiting the agglomeration and mobility of the active species and improvement the hydrogenation-alkylation performance during the catalytic process [8,54,56]. The facile recovery and excellent recyclability of the prepared catalysts have regarded as a vital evaluating index reflecting the quality of prepared catalysts for the heterogeneous reactions. As shown in Fig. S8a, the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst can be easily separate from the reaction mixture by using an extra magnet attributed to the strong magnetism of the Co species contained in Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst. Fig. S8b exhibits the excellent recyclability of the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst for hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction without any loss in its conversion of nitrobenzene (100%) and selectivities of N-ethylaniline (∼87%) and N,N-diethylaniline (∼13%) after the five recycles. All of which allows the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst to be a facile and highly efficient candidate for other catalytic reactions. Moreover, the XRD characterization was performed to the structure stability of the Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst after catalytic process. As depicted in Fig. S9, three characteristic peaks located at 45.4, 51.4 and 76.0° corresponded to crystalline facets of metallic Co (002), (101) and (110) (JCPDS No. 05-0727). As seen from the enlarged section, the dominated peaks (in the range of 30-70°) for metallic Co species contained in fresh and spent catalysts were completely overlap each other, suggesting that the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst exhibited good structure stability during the hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction. Based on the outstanding performance of developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst for hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction, the general applicability of Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst catalyzed substituted nitroarenes with ethanol, and nitrobenzene with various aliphatic and benzylic alcohols were tested (Table 3 ). The developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for hydrogenation-alkylation of substituted nitroarenes to obtain the functional N-ethylanilines (e.g. fluorine-, chlorine-, hydroxyl-, methyl-, formyl-, and cyano-group) with ethanol (entries 1–10) under the certain reaction conditions. Meanwhile, the nitrobenzene, and methyl-, formyl-, fluorine substituted nitroarenes were also converted into the corresponding functional N,N-diethylanilines when the change the reaction temperature and/or the reaction time (entries 11–14). Moreover, the tandem experiments towards the nitrobenzene with various aliphatic and benzylic alcohols were tested (entries 15–23). From the catalytic results, the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic activity and selectivity for hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline and alkylation of aniline with various aliphatic and benzylic alcohols to corresponding functional alkylates. All of these catalytic experiments results demonstrate that the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst prepared by the CAI strategy may become a promising candidate for other catalytic reactions. Based on the outstanding performance of developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst for the tandem catalytic nitroarenes with primary alcohols, the advantages of using the Co@Zn-HMTA MOFs precursor for synthesis of Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst, and the effect of pyrolysis temperature on structure, composition, morphology as well as catalytic process towards hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction were investigated. For HMTA-based MOFs, the free tertiary amine groups have priority to coordinate with transition metal ions (Co2+, Zn2+, Ni2+) due to the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) theory [60]. As depicted in Scheme 2 , the metalloligand of Zn-HMTA MOFs had abundantly free tertiary amine groups (Scheme 2a), which can facilitate the transition Co2+ ions adsorption within 2D layers via coordination interaction between d-orbitals of Co atom and lone pair electron of N atoms located at the skeleton of the HMTA ligand (Scheme 2b). The coordination interaction between the Co ions and free tertiary amine groups could efficiently strengthen the Co-ZnO and/or C-N species interaction during the pyrolysis process. For 2D Co@Zn-HMTA MOFs pyrolyzed at 450 °C (c), the strong Co-ZnO interaction resulted in formation of most CoOx-ZnO composite, and partial metallic Co due to the low pyrolysis temperature (confirmed by the XRD analysis). Upon increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 550 °C (d), the increased temperature resulted in a few Zn species containing in CoOx-ZnO composite evaporating and promote more CoOx species reduced into metallic Co, which further could improve performance for hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction. When the pyrolysis temperature was up to 650 °C (e), most of the CoOx species were converted into the metallic Co, and partial ZnO evaporated leading to exposure more active species. Moreover, the high pyrolysis temperature benefits of formation of Co-N species, which is an important factor for the improvement of the performance for the hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction. However, when the pyrolysis temperature was up to 750 °C (f), most of Co species interacted with the ZnO generating the CoOx-ZnO composite (confirmed by the XRD, Fig. 5). The generated CoOx-ZnO composite with strong CoOx-ZnO interaction is deleterious to reduction of CoOx into metallic Co, and thus reduces its activity by exposure its active sites in the form of CoOx species. For the optimized Co-ZnO@CN-CAI (pyrolyzed at 650 °C) catalyst, the more expoursed Co species active sites with small size as well as strong Co-ZnO/CN interaction could efficiently adsorb and activate the nitrobenzene molecules during the initial reaction stage. Moreover, the small size and SMSI of active Co species have strong ability of H2 dissociation, which could facilitate hydrogenation of nitrosobenzene to aniline and suppress the condensation side reaction between nitrobenzene and hydroxylamine to azobenzene. In addition, as shown in Table S3, the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst higher exhibits catalytic efficiency (193 h−1) in comparison to the activities of the reported catalysts for the hydrogenation and/or alkylation reactions, which allows the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI to be a candidate for catalysing hydrogenation-alkylation tandem reaction."
11,Conclusion,"A new hexamethylenetetramine based two-dimensional MOFs metalloligand (termed Zn-HMTA) containing abundantly uncoordinated tertiary amine groups has been successively isolated. A series of highly efficient bimetallic Co-Zn catalysts have been fabricated by pyrolysis at different temperature resulting from the unique feature of strong coordination between uncoordinated tertiary amine groups and Co2+ ions. The comparative characterization results have revealed that the small size and highly dispersed Co species, intensified Co-ZnO/CN interaction, high contents of N and Co-N species for the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst resulted in the superior performance for the hydrogenation-alkylation reaction. The kinetic study supported that alkylation is the rate-determining step in the hydrogenation-alkylation tandem catalytic process. Remarkably, the developed Co-ZnO@CN-CAI catalyst is easily recycled by using a magnet without any loss in performance. It is anticipated that this novel synthetic protocol, coordination-assisted impregnation (CAI) strategy, for the fabrication of highly efficient MOFs-derived catalysts will provide a way to design and synthesis of other self-supported catalysts for the catalytic reactions."
