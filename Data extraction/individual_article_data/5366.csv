0,Introduction,"Nitrophenols, as a class of highly toxic/hazardous and hard-degradable organic compounds, widely exist in industrial production and agricultural wastewater, and may cause great harm to natural environment and ecosystem [1]. Currently there are two major strategies attempting to treat nitrophenol compounds: the one is removal of them from wastewater via physical adsorption, chemical oxidation, microbial process or photocatalytic degradation, the other is conversion of them into treasure through catalytic hydrogenation [2–4]. For example, it is well known that p-aminophenol (p-AP), as the product of catalytic hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol (p-NP) [5], is an important intermediate for synthesis of fine chemicals, such as synthetic dyes, pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Compared with nitrophenols, aminophenols have more significant economic and social benefits, thus receiving considerable research interests [6,7]. To date, most catalysts for catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP are the size- and shape-controlled Au, Ag, Pd and Pt noble metal nanomaterials [8–10], or deposition of them on appropriate supports [11–13]. It has been demonstrated that the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP over the noble metal nanocatalysts generally follows a pseudo-first-order kinetics model [14], and the widely accepted catalytic mechanism involves four steps: adsorption and diffusion of p-NP on the active sites of the nanocatalysts, then conversion into p-AP on the nanocatalysts surface, and finally desorption of p-AP from the surface of nanocatalysts. It is noted that the noble metal nanoparticles play key roles in whole catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP [15]. Although these noble metal-based nanocatalysts possess high catalytic activity, the construction of noble metal-based nanocatalyst usually requires a cumbersome preparation process and consumes costly starting materials [16]. Moreover, the gradual exhaustion and increasingly expensive price of noble metals severely limit their large-scale industrial production [17]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop alternative catalysts with high performance, which are readily available, environmental-friendly, cost-effective, and the catalytic activity can be equivalent to (or even higher than) those of noble metal-based catalysts for the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP [18–20]. In the last few years, two dimensional graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), as a promising metal-free (photo)catalyst [21–23], has received considerable interests and is expected to be widely applied in the fields of water splitting [24–26], organic pollutant degradation [27–29], carbon dioxide reduction [30–32] and catalytic oxidation of alkane, benzene and alcohols [33–35]. Fang [36] et al. synthesized fragmented P-doped g-C3N4 nanoflakes with extended light absorption up to 800 nm, which exhibited a remarkable photocatalytic H2 production rate, far higher than that of pure g-C3N4. Jiang [31] et al. fabricated a hierarchical Z-Scheme α-Fe2O3/g-C3N4 hybrid with enhanced photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO2. Recently we reported an Au/g-C3N4 Schottky contact system with its high concerted catalytic activity in the reduction of p-NP to p-AP [14]. However, so far relatively little attention has been paid to the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP over the pure g-C3N4. Therefore, it is of great interest to study the possibility of pure g-C3N4, if that can be accomplished, then it may be possible to completely supersede noble metal-based nanocatalysts for catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP. Herein, we report a facile one-step calcination strategy to directly fabricate porous crimped graphitic carbon nitride (PCCN) using dicyandiamidine nitrate as a precursor. The results show that as-obtained PCCN possesses large specific surface area and abundant amino groups on the terminal edges of in-planar tri-s-triazine ring. The PCCN is used as a metal-free catalyst for hydrogenation of p-NP and exhibits extremely high activity in the presence of NaBH4, which can be equivalent to (or even higher than) those of the previously reported noble metal-based catalysts. More interestingly, different from the pseudo-first-order kinetics for the hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol over the noble metal-based catalysts, the hydrogenation reaction using PCCN follows the zero-order kinetics. It is found that during reaction process, the catalytic oxidation of BH4 − and the generation of hydride ion (H−) occur on the PCCN surface, while the hydrogenation process of p-nitrophenol proceeds in the bulk solution."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of the PCCN catalyst,"2.1 Synthesis of the PCCN catalyst All chemicals were of reagent grade and used without further purification and all aqueous solutions were prepared using ultra-pure water. The PCCN catalyst was prepared via calcination method using a new precursor of dicyandiamidine nitrate Typically, 5.0 mL of concentrated HNO3 was dropwise added into 40 mL of dicyandiamide solution (50.0 mg mL−1) and stirred at 40 °C for 120 min. Once the water of the mixture was removed, the dried product (dicyandiamidine nitrate) was purified by recrystallization. After that, 2.0 g of dicyandiamidine nitrate was placed into the crucible with a cover and heated to 520 °C with a ramping rate of 4 °C in the muffle furnace for 2 h, followed by a continuous heating to 550 °C with the same rate and maintain for 2 h. When the reaction was finished, the final product of PCCN was obtained. For comparison, the same method was used to synthesize graphitic carbon nitride (CN) using dicyandiamide as a precursor."
3,Catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP,"2.2 Catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP The catalytic performance of as-obtained PCCN was evaluated by the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP at room temperature in the dark. The experiments were conducted as follows: 1.0 mg of PCCN catalyst was added to 50 mL of 10 mg L−1 p-NP aqueous solution without the dissolved O2 and stirred for 30 min. And then 25 mg of NaBH4 was added directly into above mixture under continuous stirring to initiate the reaction. The whole reaction process was protected by a continuous purge with N2. At a given time interval, 4.0 mL aliquots were collected and then filtered to remove essentially all the catalysts. The concentrations of p-NP in the as-obtained clear liquid were spectrophotometrically monitored by measuring the absorbance of solutions at 400 nm. To discuss the role of N2, the contrast experiment of the catalytic reduction of p-NP without N2 was carried out under the same conditions."
4,Characterization,2.3 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of the samples were examined on a Bruker D8 Advanced diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and the scanning angle ranged from 10° to 80° of 2θ. Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 spectrometer with the wavelength from 4000 to 650 cm−1. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were carried out on a RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin Elmer) using Mg K radiation (h = 1253.6 eV). The peak positions in the XPS analysis are corrected with C1s at 284.6 eV. Elemental analyses were obtained on an EA 3000 analyzer. The morphologies were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; HITACHI S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL JEM-2100). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area was determined with nitrogen adsorption at 77 K using an adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics TriStar).
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structure and morphology,"3.1 Structure and morphology Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of the CN and PCCN. For the CN, the diffraction peaks at a 2θ value of peaks at 13.0° and 27.5° can be indexed to the (100) crystal plane of in-planar ordering of tri-s-triazine structure units and (002) crystal plane of the stacking of the conjugates aromatic system, respectively [37]. The PCCN shows only a broad and weak diffraction peak of (002) crystal plane and the diffraction peak of (100) crystal plane cannot be found due to the poor crystallinity and low in-planar ordering degree of PCCN, which may be ascribed to the presence of abundant Amino groups on the terminal edges of in-planar tri-s-triazine ring [38]. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the PCCN displays the all IR features of CN in the whole spectrum [39]. For the CN, the sharp peak located at around 804 cm−1 is assigned to the characteristic breathing vibration of the triazine ring. The peaks at 1234, 1311, 1407, 1558 and 1626 cm−1 are typical stretching vibration modes of CN heterocycles (N(C)3 and CNHC). The broad peaks at 3000–3500 cm−1 come from stretching vibration modes of NH and OH (physically absorbed H2O). However, compare with CN heterocycles, PCCN shows some additional shoulder peaks between 1200 and 1700 cm−1, which may be ascribed to the failure of ordered CN heterocyclic structure. Moreover, the characteristic peaks of NH band are more obvious than those of CN. These results further confirm that there are more amino groups on the terminal edges of in-planar tri-s-triazine ring [40], leading to the poor crystallinity and low in-planar ordering degree. Fig. 1(c, d) present the C1s and N1s XPS spectra of the CN and PCCN, respectively. For the C1s spectrum (Fig. 1c), the peaks centered at 284.6 and 288.0 eV can be assigned to CC and NCN bonds, respectively [41]. The high-resolution N1s XPS spectrum can be fitted into three peaks (Fig. 1d): the main peak at 398.5 eV is attributed to the sp2-hybridized nitrogen atom (CNC) in the triazine ring, whereas the other two weak peaks at 399.7 and 401.1 eV can be assigned to sp3-hybridized nitrogen atom (N(C)3) and terminal amino nitrogen atom (CNH), respectively [42]. Table 1 shows the N species contents (at.%) of the CN and PCCN based on XPS results. It can be clearly seen that there is a significant increase in NHx content of PCCN compared with that of CN, which can be ascribed to the presence of terminal amino of in-planar tri-s-triazine ring [43]. The elemental analysis results show that the atomic ratio of C to N for PCCN is 0.664 (Table 2 ), which is lower than that of CN (0.747), further indicative of the increased N content in PCCN. The SEM and TEM images are employed to investigate the difference of morphology and microstructure of CN and PCCN using dicyandiamide and dicyandiamidine nitrate as precursors, respectively. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 2(a) and (b) that the bulk CN is formed by stacking a substantial number of two-dimensional CN sheets. As shown in Fig. 2(c), instead of a perfect two-dimensional structure, the PCCN has curly morphology, which may be caused by the abundant terminal amino of in-planar tri-s-triazine ring, hindering the self-stacking behavior. The curly and porous structure (Fig. 2(d)) makes the PCCN possess a much larger specific surface area of 146.14 m2 g−1 compared to that of CN (3.44 m2 g−1) and relatively fluffier characteristic (Fig. 3 )."
7,The high catalytic activity of PCCN for the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP,"3.2 The high catalytic activity of PCCN for the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP The catalytic activity of the as-prepared PCCN was evaluated via catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP in the presence of NaBH4 at room temperature. It is well known that the acidic property of p-NP solution is conducive to form p-nitrophenolate ions in alkaline condition caused by the hydrolysis of NaBH4 added, resulting in a significant red-shift of the maximum absorption wavelength for p-NP solution from 317 nm to 400 nm, associated with a color change from light yellow to yellow (Fig. 4(a)) [5]. Fig. 4(b) shows the curves of the absorbance of p-NP solution versus wavelength plots at various reaction times over PCCN in the presence of NaBH4 at room temperature. It can be seen that the absorption peak at 400 nm of p-nitrophenolate ions sharply decreased and finally vanished, while the typical absorption peak of p-AP at 300 nm appeared and then increased obviously. Meanwhile, the yellow color of reaction system underwent fading to colorless within 8 min, suggesting that the p-NP molecules in the solution were completely reduced to p-AP. Moreover, the four isosbestic points at 222, 245, 278 and 312 nm indicate that no other byproducts were formed during the catalytic hydrogenation process [44]. Fig. 4(c and d) show the time profiles of C/C 0 and ln(C/C 0) using PCCN, CN and acidified graphitic carbon nitride (CN-H+) [45] as catalysts, where C and C 0 are the concentrations of p-NP at the reaction time t and 0, respectively. As shown in Table S1, it can be clearly seen that the PCCN exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP, which can be equivalent to (or even higher than) those of the previously reported noble metal-based catalysts [15,41], whereas the CN and CN-H+ are nearly inert under the same condition, even increasing the catalyst amount or prolonging reaction time (Fig. S1). More interestingly, it can be clearly seen that the plots of the conversion rate of p-NP (C/C 0) over PCCN versus reaction time (t) is almost a straight line, suggesting that the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP over PCCN follows the zero-order kinetic model, which is completely different from the pseudo-first-order kinetic model when using noble metal-based catalysts. And the rate constant of PCCN reaches up to 9.96 × 10−3 mM L−1 min−1, which is much higher than that of the CN. It is also worthy to note that the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP cannot proceed in the presence of only PCCN catalyst or NaBH4 alone (Fig. S2), indicating that neither of them is dispensable. Additionally, it is interesting that the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP hardly occurs in the first 6 min without N2 (Fig. S3), which may be attributed to the fact that the electrons released by the catalytic oxidation of BH4 − on the PCCN surface prefer to react with dissolved O2 (E p-NP/p-AP = −0. 76 V, E O2/O2 − = −0. 33 V). Therefore, the whole reaction process need to be protected by a continuous purge with N2 to remove dissolved O2. As displayed in Fig. 5(a), it can be seen that there is no noticeable decrease in the activity of PCCN for the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP after 5 cycles, demonstrating the excellent stability and reusability. Moreover, there is no change in FTIR spectrum of PCCN catalyst before and after cycling (Fig. 5(b)), further indicative of remarkable structural stability of PCCN catalyst."
8,The mechanism of the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP over PCCN catalyst,"3.3 The mechanism of the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP over PCCN catalyst It has been demonstrated that the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP over the noble metal-based catalysts generally follows the pseudo-first-order kinetics and the catalytic process involves four steps: adsorption and diffusion of p-NP to the active sites of the catalyst, then conversion into p-AP on the catalyst surface, finally desorption of the p-AP from the surface. However, our results show that the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP over the PCCN catalyst obeys the zero-order kinetics, implying a completely different mechanism. First, the adsorption of p-NP and p-nitrophenolate ions on the PCCN surface was investigated. As shown in Figs. 6 and S4, it can be seen that nearly 30% of p-NP molecules are adsorbed on the PCCN surface after stirring 30 min for reaching the adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Upon adding NaOH, all the p-NP molecules, including dissolved in the solution and adsorbed on the PCCN surface, are converted into the p-nitrophenolate ions with the wavelength of maximum absorption at 400 nm driven by an acid-base neutralization reaction (as the p-NP solution is acidic), changing the shift of the adsorption-desorption equilibrium of p-NP. Interestingly, the PCCN catalyst has no adsorption capacity for p-nitrophenolate ions and almost all p-nitrophenolate ions remain in the solution after continuously stirring for 30 min. Therefore, we can safely conclude that the catalytic hydrogenation process of p-NP does not proceed on the surface of PCCN, but occurs in the bulk solution. Therefore, the adsorption results of p-nitrophenolate ions reveal that the catalytic hydrogenation process is irrelevant to the concentration of p-NP, resulting in the zero-order reaction. Second, the interaction between PCCN catalyst and NaBH4 was investigated by recording the PL emission spectra. As shown in Fig. 7(a, b), the emission of PCCN catalyst is centered at 428 nm due to the recombination of electron-hole pairs in the valence band and conduction band. After adding NaBH4, the PL intensity of PCCN continuously decreases with the time going on. This may be ascribed to the fact that the catalytic oxidation of BH4 − and hydrolysis reaction occurred simultaneity on the PCCN surface, leading to the release of electrons and the generation of H2. Then the as-released electrons via the catalytic oxidation of BH4 − and excited electrons of PCCN catalyst could capture generated H2 to in-situ form hydride ions (H−), resulting in the fluorescence quenching. The formed H− possesses extremely strong reducibility, which can be as active species to reduce p-NP. In contrast, the PL intensity of the CN catalyst is very weak and almost constant after the addition of NaBH4, indicating that the interaction between CN catalyst and NaBH4 is negligible, which may be the main reason for low catalytic activity. For the system of CN-H+ catalyst and NaBH4, the PL intensity of the CN-H+ continuously enhances as time goes on (Fig. 7(c)), which can be ascribed to the acidification effect, leading to a reduced electron density of CN-H+, and thus the released electrons via catalytic oxidation of NaBH4 over the CN-H+ prefer to transfer to the valence band to increase the PL intensity. As there are three reductants of electrons (e), H2, and H− in the whole system, it is important to identify the main reductant in the catalytic hydrogenation process of p-NP with the PCCN as catalyst in the presence of BH4 − for better understanding the catalytic mechanism. The interaction between PCCN catalyst and NaB(C6H5)4 (as an electron donor) was firstly evaluated via PL emission spectra under the continuous purge with or without H2. As shown in Fig. 8(a–b), the PL intensity of PCCN catalyst increased with the time going on whether or not with H2, indicating that the electrons released by catalytic oxidation of NaB(C6H5)4 directly transferred to valence band of PCCN catalyst, but did not react with physically adsorbed H2O or H2 to form H−. Whereas, there is no obvious effect on the PL of PCCN catalyst only in the presence of H2 (Fig. 8(c)). To compare with the standard catalytic hydrogenation experiment of p-NP, NaBH4 was replaced by NaB(C6H5)4 or continuous purge with H2 under the same experimental conditions and the results are shown in Fig. 8(d). Clearly, there is no noticeable change in the UV–vis spectra, suggesting that e or H2 is hardly to reduce p-NP. Even in the presence of both NaB(C6H5)4 and H2, p-NP still cannot be not reduced. Only using NaBH4, PCCN can effectively catalyze the reduction reaction for p-NP. Accordingly, the H− plays the crucial role in the catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP. On the basis of the above results, a new catalytic hydrogenation mechanism of p-NP using PCCN as catalyst in the presence of NaBH4 is proposed using the following equations and illustrated in Scheme 1 . (1) (2) (3) (4) Firstly, a part of BH4 − ions participate in the hydrolysis reaction to generate OH−, and then the p-NP reacts with as-generated OH− to form the p-nitrophenolate ions, which cannot be adsorbed onto the surface of PCCN catalyst, and can only dissolve in the bulk solution (reaction (1)). Secondly, the rest of BH4 − ions undergo the catalytic oxidation reaction and hydrolysis reaction simultaneity on the PCCN surface, resulting in the release of electrons and the generation of H2 (reaction (2)). Thirdly, the generated H2 can capture the electrons to in-situ form extremely strong reductant of hydride ion (H−) (reaction (3)). Finally, the H− can quickly diffuses into the bulk solution and reduce the p-NP to p-AP (reaction (4)). It is worthy to note that the whole catalytic hydrogenation is irrelevant to the concentration of p-NP, thus such a process obeys a zero-order kinetic reaction."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, a new precursor of dicyandiamidine nitrate was employed to fabricate porous crimped graphitic carbon nitride (PCCN) via a facile one-step calcination strategy. The as-obtained PCCN possesses abundant amino groups on the terminal edges of in-planar tri-s-triazine ring and large specific surface area. The PCCN was used as a catalyst for catalytic hydrogenation of p-NP and exhibited extremely high catalytic activity in the presence of NaBH4, which can be equivalent to (or even higher than) those of the previously reported noble metal-based catalysts. Interestingly, the kinetics analysis of hydrogenation shows that the hydrogenation reaction of p-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol follows the zero-order kinetics, different from the pseudo-first-order kinetics using the noble metal-based catalysts. It is found that in the reaction process, the catalytic oxidation of BH4 − and the generation of hydride ion (H−) take place on the catalyst surface, while the hydrogenation process of p-nitrophenol proceeds in the bulk solution. This work suggests that the porous crimped graphitic carbon nitride may be used as an environmental-friendly, low-cost and high-performance catalyst in the hydrogenation of p-NP."
