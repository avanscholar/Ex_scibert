0,Introduction,"Fusel oil, a byproduct of the sugarcane-to-ethanol process, is composed primarily of isoamyl alcohol (>60 wt%). Despite not having a direct impact on the final cost of ethanol, utilization of fusel oil as industrial feedstock represents an important step toward increased overall efficiency in ethanol industries [1-3]. Studies have proposed several uses for fusel oil, among which the most promising seems to be its application as feedstock in esterification reactions, allowing to obtain a variety of esters depending on the acyl donor used, including acetic acid [4], butyric acid [5], caprylic acid [6], lauric acid [7,8], and oleic acid [9]. Substantial efforts have been directed toward the production of biolubricants by esterification of fusel oil with oleic acid, either by chemical [11,12] or biochemical [9,12] catalysis. Enzymatic catalysts (lipases) offer advantages over chemical catalysts, given that enzymatic reactions can be carried out under moderate temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions with high stereo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity, which drastically reduces the formation of undesirable byproducts and, thus, waste generation [2,6,13]. Lipases (triacylglycerol acylhydrolases, EC 3.1.1.3) are versatile enzymes able to catalyze hydrolysis as well as esterification reactions [14,15]. Enzyme-catalyzed esterification has attracted increasing attention in many applications for the superior characteristics of the resulting products [16]. More specifically, lipase-catalyzed esterification reactions have been the focus of intensive research over the past decades because of the increased use of organic esters in biotechnology and chemical industries [18,19]. Direct esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols is the most popular method for the synthesis of esters with aromatic [20], emulsifying [21], and biolubricant [13] properties. However, there is scarce literature on the use of lipases for biolubricant synthesis by direct esterification of fusel oil with long-chain carboxylic acids [2,9]. Such a limitation may be explained by technical difficulties related to the high water content of fusel oil [6,7] or intrinsic to the use of natural mixtures of alcohols in esterification reactions, such as competition between two or more nucleophiles for the same active site of the enzyme [22]. To avoid competition problems, it is recommended to perform the reaction with excess acyl donor to allow complete consumption of alcohols present at lower proportions (e.g., ethanol, butanol, pentanol). Vilas Bôas et al. [6] estimated from factorial experiments that the molar ratio of caprylic acid to fusel oil should be greater than 1.5 to achieve high ester yields and low residual concentrations of both starting materials. Predehydration techniques using molecular sieves are reported in the literature as the most effective procedures to reduce the moisture content of fusel oil to the range required for lipase-catalyzed esterification [6]. However, other sources of water need to be considered, such as, for example, water generated as a byproduct. Water formed during esterification should be eliminated from the reaction medium to avoid the gradual decrease of ester formation caused by a shift toward hydrolysis [23-25]. Of the strategies commonly applied to minimize hydrolysis, the use of desiccant agents, such as molecular sieves, has consistently provided excellent results [23,25]. Molecular sieve drying has two major advantages: it shifts the equilibrium toward ester synthesis and stabilizes the reaction product, preventing its hydrolysis [24]. This study aimed to synthesize biolubricant esters by direct esterification of fusel oil with oleic acid in a continuous packed-bed reactor. To better understand the effects of byproduct water, we coupled the reactor to a water extraction column packed with molecular sieves and compared its performance with that of a control system (without water removal). To our knowledge, this strategy has not been previously investigated in the enzymatic synthesis of ester using fusel oil as acyl acceptor. Additionally, we performed a lipase screening study for esterification of secondary alcohols, adopting an experimental design to develop an optimized process that saves time, money, and resources."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Microbial lipases from Candida rugosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Thermomyces lanuginosus, and Penicillium camemberti were acquired from Sigma–Aldrich. Lipase from Rhizopus oryzae was purchased from Biocatalysts (Cardiff, Walles, UK). These enzymes were obtained in their free form and later immobilized on silica–hydroxyethylcellulose hybrid support following the method described by Vilas Bôas et al. [8] and Bradford [17]. Poly(styrene/divinylbenzene) (Diaion™ HP-20 resin, STY/DVB) was purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA), having the following properties: average pore diameter of 260 Å, surface area of 500 m2 g−1, and average pore volume of 1.01 cm3 g−1. Fusel oil was kindly provided by a local distillery (São Martinho S.A., Iracema Unit, Iracemápolis, SP, Brazil); the material contained 65 wt% isoamyl alcohol, 8 wt% isobutyl alcohol, 0.4 wt% n-butyl alcohol, 1.5 wt% n-propyl alcohol, 10 wt% ethyl alcohol, and 15 wt% water. Molecular sieves (3 Å, sodium aluminum silicate) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Before use, fusel oil was dried from 15 to 0.1 wt% water with molecular sieves (20% w/v) according to the method of Vilas Bôas et al. [8]. Water content was quantified on an automatic titrator (Karl Fischer, model Koehler AKF5000). Other reagents used were oleic acid (98%, Cromoline), heptane and hexanol (Vetec), isooctane (Cromoline), polyethylene glycol (PEG-1500, Synth), gum arabic (Synth), potassium hydroxide (85% min, Cromoline), and low-acidity olive oil (Carbonell, purchased at a local market). A standard solution of isoamyl oleate was obtained by chemical synthesis according to Vilas Bôas et al. [8] and used for chromatographic calibration."
3,Lipase immobilization,"2.2 Lipase immobilization Microbial lipases were immobilized via interfacial activation (hydrophobic interaction) according to the procedure described by Alves et al. [27], with slight modifications. STY/DVB particles (10 g) were wetted with 50 mL of ethanol solution (95 wt%) under static conditions for 18 h at 25°C. After this period, the mixture was filtered in a Buchner funnel under vacuum and thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove residual ethanol. The wet support (10 g) was incubated in 190 mL of 5 mmol L−1 sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) using an initial loading of free commercial lipase of 250 mg g−1 support. Suspensions were kept under constant stirring (200 rpm) in an orbital shaker at 25°C for 12 h. The prepared biocatalyst was filtered (Whatman No. 41) under vacuum and washed with chilled hexane. Subsequently, the immobilized biocatalyst was conditioned in a vacuum desiccator to reduce the water content to below 5 wt%. The enzymatic activities of immobilized lipases were determined by hydrolysis of olive oil, according to the method described by Vilas Bôas et al. [6]. The esterification activity of immobilized P. camemberti lipase was measured according to Pinto et al. [10]. For the selected biocatalyst (immobilized Rhizopus oryzae) the kinetic constants K M and V max were determined using EnzFitter software (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The effect of temperature on biocatalyst stability was determined by incubating the immobilized derivative at 60°C in aqueous medium (0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7) for different periods. After heat treatment, immobilized lipase samples were cooled and residual activity determined by adding 5 mL of substrate (olive oil/water emulsion). Results were analyzed using Statistica version 13 (StatSoft Inc., USA)."
4,Enzymatic esterification of fusel oil and oleic acid in batch mode,2.3 Enzymatic esterification of fusel oil and oleic acid in batch mode Esterification reactions of isoamyl alcohol or fusel oil with oleic acid were carried out in 50 mL agitated closed-tank reactors operated in batch mode. Alcohol and acid mixtures were incubated in the presence of isooctane solvent and different preparations of immobilized lipase at a catalytic loading of 400 units of activity (U) per gram of reaction medium for a maximum period of 72 h under magnetic stirring (150 rpm) at 45°C to obtain isoamyl oleate. The reaction was monitored by analyzing samples taken from the reactor at different times and quantifying isoamyl alcohol consumption and product formation by gas chromatography. Ester productivity was calculated by dividing the number of micromoles of produced ester by the reaction time and mass of immobilized biocatalyst. The experiments were performed in triplicate and the standart error was calculated using the software Origin (9.0).
5,Experimental design,2.4 Experimental design A 22 full factorial design with triplicate runs of the center point was used to examine the influence of the variables acid/alcohol molar ratio (X 1) and temperature (X 2) on the esterification yield of fusel oil with oleic acid by the previously selected immobilized lipase preparations. Real and coded levels of independent variables are shown in Table 1 . Esterifications were carried out in 50 mL closed reactors containing 20 mL of a substrate consisting of previously dehydrated fusel oil and oleic acid at acid/alcohol molar ratios of 0.75:1 to 1.25:1 (the proportion of fusel oil was calculated based on its concentration of isoamyl alcohol). Mixtures were incubated with immobilized lipase at a catalytic loading of 350 U g−1 for a maximum of 48 h under magnetic stirring (150 rpm) in the temperature range of 40 to 50°C. Samples were collected at periodic intervals to quantify alcohol consumption and ester concentration by gas chromatography. Fatty acid consumption was quantified by volumetric titration. Carboxylic acids were determined according to the method described by De Castro et al. [26]. All experiments were carried out in random order. The response variable was ester content. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica software version 13.
6,Enzymatic esterification of fusel oil and oleic acid in continuous flow,"2.5 Enzymatic esterification of fusel oil and oleic acid in continuous flow In this set of experiments, enzymatic esterification was carried out under continuous flow conditions according to a method described in a previous study [8]. Runs were performed in jacketed glass columns. The temperature in the reactor was kept at 45 °C by circulating heated water through the jacket. Two experimental setups were used: (i) a control condition, in which the reactor was packed with 2.60 g of immobilized lipase and no technique was used to remove byproduct water, and (ii) a water-free reaction, which was performed in a two-stage packed-bed reactor coupled with a water extraction column. In the second setup, saturated molecular sieves were replaced with regenerated sieves at least at every two space times. Each column was packed with 2.60 g of immobilized lipase and the intermediate water extraction column was packed with 7.30 g of molecular sieves (1:3 weight ratio) (Fig. 1 ). Each reactor column measured 15 mm in diameter and 55 mm in length, with a volume of 10 cm3, an inlet flow of 1.1 mL h−1, and an output flow of 1.58 mL h−1. The reaction mixture (fusel oil and oleic acid at a molar ratio of 1:1.5 in isooctane medium) was kept in a feed flask under magnetic stirring (150 rpm) at 45°C and pumped through the columns by a peristaltic pump (SJ-1211, Atto). The water content in the substrate was maintained at an initial value of less than 500 ppm by using molecular sieves. Space time was calculated according to Levenspiel [29], taking into consideration the specific mass of the immobilized biocatalyst (0.6935 g cm−3). The progress of esterification was monitored by collecting samples at the reactor output and determining the levels of starting materials and reaction products (mainly isoamyl oleate). Water contents in samples (liquid phase) collected before and after the water extraction column were quantified by using an automatic titrator (Karl Fischer, model Koehler AKF5000). Ester productivity was calculated as the ratio of moles of ester produced per space time to the mass of immobilized biocatalyst."
7,Determination of reactant and product concentrations,"2.6 Determination of reactant and product concentrations Isoamyl oleate (product) formation and isoamyl alcohol consumption were determined using a gas chromatograph (Varian, model GC 3800, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a TR FAME capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and 0.25 µm film thickness). The detector temperature was set at 230°C and the injector temperature at 190°C. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. Gas flow rates to the detector were 30 mL min−1 for H2 and 300 mL min−1 for synthetic air. The column temperature was initially set at 40°C for 1 min and then heated to 70°C for 3 min at a rate of 20°C min−1, followed by heating to 120°C at a rate of 20°C min−1, then to 250°C at a rate of 25°C min−1, and holding at this temperature for 5 min. Octanol (10 g L−1) in hexane was used as internal standard. Data collection and analysis were performed using Galaxie System version 1.9. Oleic acid was determined by titration of sample aliquots diluted in ethanol with 50 mmol L−1 KOH solution using phenolphthalein as indicator [28,30]."
8,Ester purification,"2.7 Ester purification The ester formed was purified according to the method described by Vilas Bôas et al. [8]. The biocatalyst was separated from the reaction system by filtration in a Buchner funnel lined with filter paper (Whatman No. 41). Then, it was transferred to a 250 mL dropping funnel, and incubated with anhydrous ethanol (volume ratio 1:2) at room temperature to remove unreacted alcohol. Subsequently, oleic acid was removed by neutralization with 5% (w/v) Na2CO3 solution (volume ratio 1:1), and NaCl was added to help separate organic and aqueous phases. The organic phase was distilled to remove any trace of fusel oil and oleic acid, and the purified sample was analyzed for purity and biolubricant properties. Absolute viscosity was determined on an LVDV-II cone and plate spindle viscometer (Brookfield Viscometers Ltd, England) using CP 42 cones at 40 ± 0.1°C. Samples of 0.5 mL were used, and measurements were repeated three times. The viscosity index was determined on a Stabinger Viscometer (SVM™ 3001 Anton Paar GmbH) following the ASTM D7042 standard. Calculations were performed according to the ASTM D2270 method. Specific mass was determined according to the standard method ASTM D4052 using a DMA 35N EX digital densimeter (Anton Paar) at 20°C and 2 mL of sample. Water content was measured using an automatic titrator (Karl Fischer, model Koehler AKF5000). ATR-FTIR spectra for fusel oil, isoamyl alcohol, oleic acid, and isoamyl oleate were recorded on a Spectrum GX Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, USA). Spectroscopy readings were obtained by accumulation of 32 scans in the wavenumber range of 4000 to 400 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. Potassium bromide (KBr) was used as matrix. 1H (300 MHz) and 13C (75 MHz) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Mercury 300 MHz Varian spectrometer. Purified ester was dissolved in CDCl3, and the resulting solution was placed in a 5 mm diameter NMR tube."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Lipase screening for isoamyl oleate synthesis,"3.1 Lipase screening for isoamyl oleate synthesis All five lipases were immobilized on STY/DVB with high efficiency (75%), demonstrating that the immobilization procedure was successful. Immobilized derivatives had high hydrolytic activities (1995–4128 U g−1) (Table 2 ). To minimize reaction reversibility, we took special care in obtaining immobilized preparations with low water contents (≤6% w/w). It is important to mention that the catalytic activity of P. camemberti lipase was measured in nonaqueous medium after esterification of ethanol with oleic acid [31]. The synthetic activity of immobilized P. camemberti lipase was 255 ± 0.18 U g−1. Given that screening experiments were used for the initial assessment of lipase esterification activity, they were conducted under a preliminary set of reaction conditions that may not have been optimal for all immobilized lipases. In a typical reaction, 400 U of immobilized derivative is added to an equimolar mixture of isoamyl alcohol and oleic acid. Screening results are reported as consumption of starting materials and ester formation as a function of time (Fig. 2 ). As demonstrated in Fig. 2, all immobilized lipases catalyzed the synthesis of isoamyl oleate. The reaction rate was dependent on lipase source, a fact that might be correlated with biocatalyst specificity. The highest conversion was recorded at 24 h, when ester concentrations were highest (Fig. 2). All immobilized lipases achieved molar conversions greater than 95% in 12 h of reaction, except for P. fluorescens and T. lanuginosus immobilized derivatives, which afforded total conversions in 72 to 120 h of reaction. C. rugosa lipase (Fig. 2a) had a comparatively lower reaction speed, requiring 24 h to completely convert the starting materials. Two immobilized lipases (R. oryzae and P. camemberti lipases) showed high activity in the synthesis of isoamyl oleate, with ester productivities of 1000 µmol g−1 min−1 (Table 2). Thus, immobilized R. oryzae lipase was chosen for oleic acid and fusel oil esterification reactions. The biocatalyst has consistently afforded high yields of ester products by esterification, transesterification, and interesterification because of its high regioselectivity in the acylation of primary and secondary alcohols [6,30]. In the hydrolysis of olive oil, R. oryzae lipase immobilized on STY/DVB showed a K M of 852 mM, a V max of 52 961 µmol g−1 min−1, and good thermal stability (8.5 h at 60°C)."
11,Optimization of isoamyl oleate synthesis catalyzed by immobilized R. oryzae lipase,"3.2 Optimization of isoamyl oleate synthesis catalyzed by immobilized R. oryzae lipase After selecting the most efficient biocatalyst, we conducted experiments to optimize reaction conditions for the synthesis of isoamyl oleate catalyzed by immobilized R. oryzae lipase. A 22 full factorial design was adopted, with acid/alcohol molar ratio (X 1) and temperature (X 2) as independent variables and isoamyl alcohol molar conversion and isoamyl oleate concentration as response variables. Table 3 shows the design matrix and experimental results. With oleic acid as an acyl group donor, R. oryzae biocatalyst was effective in catalyzing isoamyl oleate synthesis under all experimental conditions tested. Only temperature significantly influenced the results. The highest ester concentrations were obtained at 45°C, regardless of the acid/alcohol molar ratio. The best performance was achieved in runs 9, 10, and 11, in which oleic acid and isoamyl alcohol were used at the equimolar ratio and the reaction was conducted at 45°C. Under these conditions, high molar conversions of both starting materials (93–95%) and high ester concentrations (1.45 mol L−1) were obtained. Experimental data were used to generate a Pareto chart (Fig. S1, Supplementary material), which indicated that only the quadratic term of temperature (X 1 2) was significant at the 95% confidence level, whereas acid/alcohol molar ratio was not significant. The main effects of independent variables on ester concentration were assessed by multiple regression analysis. A polynomial model (Eq. 1) exhibited the best fit to the data (R 2 = 0.7315). Although the model had limited predictive performance, it allowed gaining insight into the optimal range of reaction conditions, as supported by its ability to explain 73% of the data variance. (1) Y = 1.368 − 0.007 X 1 − 0.205 X 1 2 − 0.053 X 2 − 0.325 X 2 2 + 0.065 X 1 X 2 where Y is the response variable (ester concentration in mol L−1) and X 1 and X 2 are the coded values of acid/alcohol molar ratio and temperature, respectively. Our discussion of the influence of factors according to the proposed model is in accordance with analysis of variance (ANOVA) of experimental data (Table 4 ). ANOVA provides results for linear (X 1 and X 2) and quadratic (X 1 2 and X 2 2) terms of the independent variables as well as their interaction (X 1 X 2). ANOVA indicated that, at a significance level of 95%, the quadratic term (X 2 2) of temperature exerted a significant effect on the response variable. Acid/alcohol molar ratio, on the other hand, did not have a significant influence at the 95% level. Therefore, experimental data for immobilized R. oryzae lipase were well fitted to the quadratic model (p < 0.05). The statistical model (Eq. 1) was used to generate a response surface plot showing the influence of acid/alcohol molar ratio, temperature, and their interaction on the response variable (Fig. S2, Supplementary material). Overall, the results revealed an experimental trend and a defined behavior: regardless of the temperature adopted, the use of acid and alcohol at the equimolar ratio favors high concentrations of isoamyl oleate."
12,Biolubricant synthesis in batch mode,"3.3 Biolubricant synthesis in batch mode The following optimal conditions for esterification of fusel oil with oleic acid catalyzed by R. oryzae lipase immobilized on STY/DVB were determined by experimental design and used in a batch reaction: 400 U g−1 biocatalyst, 45°C, 150 rpm, and 1:1.5 fusel oil/oleic acid molar ratio. In previous studies by our research group, it was found that for substrates containing excess of alcohol (alcohol:acid molar ratio = 1:0.5), esterification conversions of less than 20% were obtained using the same biocatalyst.. Therefore, it was observed that only the reactions carried out on substrates containing excess acid (alcohol:acid molar ratio = 1:1.5) achieved conversions greater than 85%. In general, the excess of acid ensures the formation of the enzyme-acyl group complex for subsequent reaction with alcohol, thus leading to the formation of the ester, and thus reducing competition between acceptors, an essential parameter for the kinetics of esterification reaction. These results obtained in our previous work, suggested that the synthesis of isoamyl oleate could be limited by the concentration of oleic acid, suggesting the need to work with excess of this reagent. The time course study provided insight into the performance of R. oryzae lipase immobilized on STY/DVB as the reaction progressed. Such a reaction profile allows determining the time necessary for obtaining the highest ester yield, contributing to enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the process. The reaction was monitored by determining isoamyl oleate (product) formation and consumption of oleic acid and isoamyl alcohol, the latter of which represents the major part of short-chain alcohols in fusel oil (about 65 wt%). As shown in Fig. 3 a, ester formation increased gradually with time up to 24 h, when equilibrium was reached and isoamyl alcohol was completely converted to isoamyl oleate (0.74 ± 0.07 mol L−1), corresponding to an ester productivity of 10.28 µmol g−1 min−1. Overall, these findings show that excess oleic acid ensured the formation of the acyl–enzyme complex for subsequent reaction with alcohol, leading to ester synthesis and thereby minimizing competition between acyl group acceptors. This is an essential parameter for the kinetics of esterification reactions [6,23,32]. Our results agree with those of Oliveira et al. [33], who studied enzymatic esterification of butanol with butyric acid in heptane medium using C. rugosa lipase immobilized on STY/DVB as heterogeneous biocatalyst. In this case, reactant polarity (measured as partition coefficient) was higher for butanol than butyric acid, favoring the migration of butanol to the solid phase (heterogeneous biocatalyst). The authors hypothesized that there was more alcohol than carboxylic acid at the active site of immobilized lipase, requiring excess acid in the reaction medium to provide equimolar amounts of reactants and high ester yields. Enzyme activity was not inhibited when butyric acid was used in excess. In the referred study, esterification was limited by butyric acid availability in the reactor vessel, and the highest yield was recorded when the acid/alcohol molar ratio was 1.5:1. Similar results were reported for other lipases. A previous study investigated the esterification of fusel oil with caprylic acid catalyzed by R. oryzae lipase immobilized on SiO2/β-cyclodextrin (SiO2/βCD) [6]. The authors found that caprylic acid/fusel oil molar ratio was a critical factor for achieving high yields of isoamyl caprylate. A slight excess of caprylic acid was required (1.5:1 caprylic acid/fusel oil molar ratio). Such similar findings may be attributed to the hydrophobic character of supports (STY/DVB and SiO2/βCD) and the partition coefficient values of immobilized biocatalysts."
13,Biolubricant synthesis in continuous mode,"3.4 Biolubricant synthesis in continuous mode For assessment of the role of water molecules on continuous enzymatic synthesis of isoamyl oleate, the packed-bed reactor was initially run without using any strategy to remove water molecules formed during the reaction. The results are presented in Fig. 3b. The steady-state was reached within 12 h (less than 2 space times), and isoamyl oleate concentration remained stable at 0.75 ± 0.08 mol L−1 (649.69 ± 32.60 µmol g−1 min−1) for up to 24 h. Then, a gradual decrease in isoamyl oleate formation was observed, resulting in ester concentrations lower than 0.34 mol L−1 at 48 h of reaction. Subsequently, the concentrations of both starting materials increased, leading to a decrease in ester synthesis. These results are due to accumulation of water in the packed-bed reactor. Water content increased from 0.05 to 0.29 wt% after 48 h of reaction, altering medium polarity and shifting the chemical equilibrium toward ester hydrolysis. Although low operational stability was observed, ester productivity was about 65 times higher than that achieved in batch reactions, demonstrating the potential of continuous systems compared with traditional batch systems. In esterification reactions, adsorption of water molecules is important for maintaining the activity of the three-dimensional structure of lipase [13,37]. However, high water retention capacity may lead to a decrease in catalytic activity, stemming from a possible increase in the partitioning of short-chain alcohols to the biocatalyst microenvironment. As a result, acyl–enzyme complex formation is drastically reduced, because partitioning of oleic acid molecules from the bulk reaction to the active sites of immobilized R. oryzae lipase molecules is reduced, thereby creating a more hydrophilic microenvironment [34]. Although a hydrophobic support (STY/DVB) was used for biocatalyst preparation, water might have accumulated through interaction with immobilized R. oryzae lipase molecules on external and internal support surfaces. Water accumulation might also have accelerated the desorption of R. oryzae lipase molecules from the support surface, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity. To overcome such limitations, we adopted a strategy to prevent reaction reversal and desorption of R. oryzae lipase from the support surface: molecular sieves were used as dehydrating agents. In this experiment, esterification was carried out in a continuous two-stage packed-bed reactor coupled to a water extraction column filled with molecular sieves (Fig. 1). By using this experimental setup, it was possible to replace saturated molecular sieves with new ones every two space times, so that the second reactor column was fed with medium containing very low levels of water. This approach allowed maintaining favorable conditions to sustain equilibrium toward ester synthesis. As shown in Fig. S3 (Supplementary material), the water content of the liquid phase from the first column outlet gradually increased during the reaction, whereas that of the second column remained almost constant at 0.4 wt% and lower, favoring ester synthesis. By using a flow rate of 1.58 mL h−1 (space time of 10.2 h), the steady-state was achieved in 12 h, and ester concentration remained at 0.93 ± 0.06 mol L−1 for up to 120 h, followed by a gradual decrease (Fig. 4 ). This experimental setup was more stable, allowing the system to be run under steady-state conditions for 3 days (292.20 ± 18.46 µmol g−1 min−1), in contrast with the 1 day of steady-state conditions achieved with the single-stage reactor (control)."
14,Biocatalyst operational stability,"3.5 Biocatalyst operational stability High biocatalyst stability is required for industrial application of continuous lipase-catalyzed reactions. Biocatalyst stability in packed-bed reactors is influenced by many factors, such as enzyme leakage from the support, pore obstruction by sludge or byproducts, loss of support by attrition, and obstruction of the packed bed, thereby leading to bypass [35]. In esterification reactions, bulk feed water content is an additional limiting factor, as previously discussed [23]. Table 5 summarizes the half-life (t 1/2) and inactivation constant (k d) of immobilized biocatalyst for each experimental setup (single-stage and two-stage packed-bed reactors). The parameters were determined by fitting a first-order kinetic inactivation model to experimental data [36]. k d values were determined from the slope of the relative activity versus time plot (Fig. 5 ). Interestingly, high correlation coefficients (R 2 > 0.98) were obtained for both experimental setups, demonstrating that the model can be successfully used to describe enzyme inactivation. The results showed that molecular sieves play an important role in esterification reactions, acting as receptors of water molecules formed as byproduct. Medium polarity is an important factor for the partitioning of water between liquid and solid phases. This event can be affected by biocatalyst stability when insufficient amounts of molecular sieves are used. It is clear from the results that the water extraction column is a promising strategy to enhance stability; the biocatalyst t 1/2 was 179.6 h, about three times greater than that in the single-stage packed-bed reactor."
15,Ester properties,"3.6 Ester properties The product mixture was composed of esters derived from fusel oil and unreacted starting materials. To obtain pure ester, we treated the product mixture according to previously described methods [27,37]. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was used to identify the organic functions of reactants (fusel oil and oleic acid) and the major product (isoamyl oleate). Their spectra are illustrated in Fig. S4a–c (Supplementary material). As shown in Fig. S4a (Supplementary material), the fusel oil spectrum exhibits an intense band at 3320 cm−1, attributed to the OH group, confirming the presence of alcohols. The bands between 2955 and 2871 cm−1 correspond to symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching vibrations of methyl and methylene C–H groups. The band at 1055 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of the C–O bond of a primary alcohol. In the spectrum of oleic acid, there is an intense band at about 2971 cm−1, attributable to stretching of C–H overlapped with O–H bond, whereas the stretching vibration of carbonyl group from the carboxylic moiety is evidenced by the band at 1707 cm−1. The OH group of isoamyl alcohol was not detected in the ATR-FTIR spectrum of isoamyl oleate, confirming the high purity of the product. Moreover, the intense band at 1737 cm−1 corresponds to the carbonyl group of ester and the bands at 1244 and 1167 cm−1 to the stretching vibration of –C(=O)O– groups [13], demonstrating the successful synthesis of isoamyl oleate. Ester synthesis was also confirmed by 13C NMR and 1H NMR analysis, as shown in Fig. S5a–b (Supplementary material). In the 13C NMR spectrum of isoamyl oleate ester (Fig. S5a), the peak at 174.00 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl group [–CH2(C=O)OCH2–] of the ester backbone. The presence of ester was also confirmed by two specific hydrogen peaks that make up the triplet in the 2.25–2.30 ppm region, representing a methylene group attached to the carbonyl group of the ester radical [–CH 2(C=O)OCH 2–], and two hydrogens that comprise the triplet in the region between 4.06 and 4.11 ppm, attributable to a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom [–CH2(C=O)OCH 2 –]. The spectrum also shows other peaks in the region corresponding to esters formed by other alcohols present in fusel oil. Spectroscopic analyses (ATR-FTIR and NMR) confirmed the successful synthesis of isoamyl oleate. The purified ester product was found to have the following properties: kinematic viscosity at 40°C of 6.95 × 10−6 m2 s−1, specific mass of 820.6 kg m−3, viscosity index of 171, and water content of 0.06 wt%. Such properties are in agreement with literature data for isoamyl oleate obtained from fusel oil [9]."
16,Conclusion,"This study reports a practical evaluation of a potential method of continuous biolubricant production by esterification. To control the effects of byproduct water, we used a two-stage packed-bed reactor coupled to a water extraction column. In establishing the operational conditions for isoamyl oleate synthesis, several immobilized lipase preparations were analyzed and indicated R. oryzae lipase as potential biocatalyst in this bioconversion achieving 90% minimum of molar conversion. The optimal conditions for isoamyl oleate production by immobilized R. oryzae lipase were 1:1.5 ratio of fusel oil to oleic acid and reaction temperature of 45°C. Using optimized conditions under continuous run it was possible to achieve an ester productivity of 292.20 ± 18.46 μmol g−1 min−1 and satisfactory biocatalyst stability (t 1/2 = 179.6 h). These findings were evidence of the good performance and high potential of the tested experimental setup and prepared biocatalyst. The physicochemical properties of purified ester were similar to those of commercially available ester, suggesting that it can be used as a lubricant in industrial processes."
