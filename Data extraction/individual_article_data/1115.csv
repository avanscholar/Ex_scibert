0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is a critical chemical transformation in widespread demands of organic synthesis, pharmaceutical industries, cosmetics and foods, which has recently attracted extensive research interest [1–6]. However, several serious challenges arise in this reaction, due to a more favorable hydrogenation of CC than CO [7–12]. In order to overcome this difficulty, the design and preparation of efficient catalysts is crucial for improving process efficiency and economy [13,14]. In heterogeneous catalysis, the arrangement and electronic property of surface atoms greatly influence adsorption configuration and activation of reactants [15–18], thus determining selectivity and activity of hydrogenation reactions [19–22]. Therefore, the catalytic materials with specific ordered surface structure have evoked extensive interest in this area, since some researches have confirmed that the selectivity of hydrogenation toward definite functional groups is due to the unique surface microstructure [22,23]. The ordered alloys, also known as intermetallic compounds (IMCs), display specific ordered crystalline structure and well-defined surface metal atomic arrangement, making them hopeful candidates for selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes [24–27]. The electron-modified and ordered bimetallic surface would provide applicable active sites and catalytic reaction environment for selective hydrogenation reactions [8,23]. In addition, the site isolation of active metals in the ordered structure, as opposed to their random arrangements in alloys, provides specific electronic and geometric effect toward obvious increase in catalytic selectivity [28,29]. Detailly, IMCs, with extremely specific surface structure, facilitate activation of substrate molecules with well-defined strength, configuration and mode, and thus induce directed catalytic conversion [30–32]. Nevertheless, very few studies have been systematically performed to reveal the key role of surface atomic structure of IMCs catalysts in regulating the catalytic performance. This inspires us to uncover the correlation between surface atomic structures and hydrogenation selectivity of unsaturated aldehydes, in order to provide helpful instructions for the development of novel IMCs toward selective hydrogenation reactions. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of supported nanoscale Ni-based IMCs (NiSb and NiBi) via structural transformation from layered double hydroxides (LDHs) precursor (Fig. 1 A). The as-obtained Ni-based IMCs samples are characterized by uniform dispersion of nano-particles. Notably, NiBi IMCs catalyst exhibits the optimal selectivity toward unsaturated alcohols (selectivity: 97.2%, 93.2%, 94.5%, 97.7%, 97.9% and 98.9%, respectively) in selective hydrogenation of multifarious unsaturated aldehydes (crotonaldehyde, 3-methyl-2-butenal, 2-pentenal, furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and cinnamaldehyde), in comparison with Ni and NiSb samples. The excellent selectivity and universality, to the best of our knowledge, is rather rare and promising in the current IMCs catalytic systems. A comprehensive study including STEM, XANES, and in situ COIR verifies a rugged and ordered surface atomic arrangement of NiBi IMCs with steric hindering effect; in situ FT-IR and DFT verify that this unique surface atomic structure induces a vertical adsorption configuration (via terminal O in CO group connecting to Ni) for various unsaturated aldehydes, resulting in the predominant selectivity to unsaturated alcohols."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials and synthesis,"2.1 Materials and synthesis All following inorganic and organic reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich: Sb powder, Bi powder, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, NH4NO3, CO(NH2)2, Al2(SO4)3·18H2O, sodium tartrate and acetone. Concretely, the sodium tartrate serves as a morphology control agent in the preparation of Al2O3 microspheres. Synthesis of ultrathin Ni2Al-LDHs precursor. Ni2Al-LDHs was synthesized by hydrothermal way reported previously by our group [33]. Synthesis of Ni-based IMCs. The mixtures with Sb/Ni or Bi/Ni molar ratio of 1/1, were obtained by mixing Ni2Al-LDHs with Sb (or Bi) powder by grinding. The above resulting mixture (1.0 g) was reduced in a H2/N2 (1/9, v/v) stream at 450 °C for 6 h followed by cooling in a N2 stream at room temperature for 1 h. The reduction treatment results in structural transformation from LDHs precursor to NiSb or NiBi IMCs. Finally, as-prepared samples were cooled to room temperature in N2 atmosphere. For comparison, supported monometallic Ni sample was prepared via a similar procedure from Ni2Al-LDHs precursor without addition of Sb (or Bi) powder."
3,Catalytic evaluations,"2.2 Catalytic evaluations Substrate (crotonaldehyde, 3-methyl-2-butenal, 2-pentenal, furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and cinnamaldehyde) (1 mL), solvent (30 mL iso-PrOH), and catalyst (0.1 mmol Ni) were placed in a stainless-steel reactor. The air was completely replaced in reactor by hydrogen 5 times. As reactor temperature was enhanced to 100 °C, hydrogen was flowed into reactor with 2 MPa pressure."
4,Instrumentation,"2.3 Instrumentation Powder XRD characterization was conducted by using Cu Ka radiation at 40 mA and 40 kV (Rigaku XRD-6000 diffractometer). SEM images were obtained by using Zeiss Supra 55 scanning electron microscopes. The JEOL JEM-2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscopes (TEM) was used to study morphology and structure of samples. Aberration-corrected high angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ac-HAADF-STEM) and element energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping measurements were carried out on JEOL JEM-ARM200 F instrument. Ni XAFS measurement was performed at the beam line 1W2B of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). FT-IR characterization of CO adsorption as well as substrate (crotonaldehyde, furfural and cinnamaldehyde) adsorption were performed on Bruker infrared spectrometer in reactor on a VERTEX 70 spectrometer. FT-IR reactor was equipped with KBr window, installed with inlet and outlet flow, whose temperature was adjusted by thermocouple. The sample (50 mg) was pressed into a self-supporting wafer (diameter: 12 mm)."
5,DFT calculations,"2.4 DFT calculations Spin-polarized periodic DFT calculations were carried out by Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP 5.4.1) [34,35]. The projector augmented wave (PAW) [36,37] way and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhoff (PBE) [38] functional were performed to resolve Kohn-Sham equations. To examine the effect of van der Waals interaction on reaction energy, the Grimme’s DFT-D3 [39] was added. The most exposed surface for Ni(111) and NiBi(101), was performed to further study on adsorption structure and adsorption energies of substrate molecules. The NiBi(101) and Ni(111) surface were represented by p(2 × 2) and p(4 × 4) periodic unit cell. The influence of size effect of NiBi(101) surface on furfural adsorption energies was shown (Figure S1). For Ni(111) and NiBi(101) surface, 4 × 4 × 1 k-point grid was used. The adsorption energies (E ads) of reactant and product were calculated on the basis of the equation: (1) Eads = E total – (E surface + E adsorbate) Where E total is system energy after adsorption; E surface is surface energy before adsorption (clean surface), and E adsorbate is free adsorption energy in gas phase."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structural and morphological characterizations on Ni-based IMCs,"3.1 Structural and morphological characterizations on Ni-based IMCs These flower-like microspheres of Ni2Al-LDHs precursor were synthesized by in situ growth approach reported by our group [33], whose XRD pattern (Fig. 1B) displayed characteristic (003) and (006) reflection at 2θ 11.46 and 23.08° [40], respectively. With the introduction of Sb or Bi powder with Ni2Al-LDHs (total Sb/Ni or Bi/Ni molar ratio: 1/1) by grinding (Figs. S2 and S3), a pursuant reduction process in hydrogen atmosphere results in structural transformation from LDHs precursor to obtain Ni and Ni-based IMCs (NiSb and NiBi). Fig. 1C shows XRD pattern of the corresponding catalysts which are indexed to following crystalline phases: Ni-PDF#04-0850 (Fig. 1C, curve a), NiSb-PDF#41-1439 (Fig. 1C, curve b) and NiBi-PDF#03-1169 (Fig. 1C, curve c). The LDHs precursors were completely reduced to supported catalysts with dehydration of hydroxyl and removal of carbonate. FT-IR spectra (Fig. S4) show no characteristic bands at 3300―3600 and 1410―1260 cm―1 of hydroxyl group [41], indicating the absence of hydroxyl group for the monometallic Ni and Ni-based IMCs. These as-prepared catalysts (Ni, NiSb and NiBi IMCs) inherit flower-like structure of Ni2Al-LDHs, as shown in the SEM images (Fig. 2 A1, B1 and C1). TEM images of these samples (Fig. 2A2, B2 and C2) display a uniform dispersion and high density of nanoparticles for Ni (∼9.2 nm), NiSb (∼10.4 nm) and NiBi (∼11.0 nm), respectively. EDX elemental mapping shows a homogeneous dispersion of Ni, Sb, or Bi (Fig. 2A3, B3 and C3). HRTEM images reveal clear lattice fringes (Fig. 2A4, B4 and C4), corresponding to Ni (d 111 = 0.203 nm), NiBi (d 101 = 0.284 nm) and NiBi (d 101 = 0.297 nm), respectively, in accord with cell parameter obtained from their XRD pattern (Fig. 1C, curve a, b and c). The monometallic Ni and homogeneous NiBi IMCs structure are further studied by high-angle-annular-dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (Fig. 2D1 and E1). The monometallic Ni at center of nanoparticle (Fig. 2D1) is featured by bright area (Ni column), with the atomic plane distance of 0.204 nm, which is in accordance with the lattice spacing of Ni (111). In contrast, the NiBi structure at the center of nanoparticle (Fig. 2E1) is characterized by alternating smaller (Ni column) and bigger (Bi column) contrast, due to the huge difference in atomic radius between Ni and Bi atoms. The atomic plane distance is measured as 0.297 nm, in good agreement with the lattice spacing of intermetallic NiBi (101). Moreover, HAADF-STEM image reveals the specific rugged and ordered surface atomic structure, in which both Ni and Bi atoms are homogeneously distributed. According to XRD and HR-HAADF-STEM results, the surface atomic structures of Ni(111) and NiBi(101) are shown in Fig. 2D2 and E2."
8,Catalytic evaluation toward selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes,"3.2 Catalytic evaluation toward selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes We performed hydrogenation reaction of crotonaldehyde to explore the product distribution with reaction time, and Fig. S5 displayed the relationship between catalytic behavior of NiBi IMCs and reaction condition (reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure). Based on the above consequence, 100 °C of reaction temperature and 2 MPa of hydrogen pressure were chosen. Under the reaction condition, catalytic behavior of monometallic Ni and Ni-based IMCs was studied in hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde as a model reaction (Table 1 , entries 1―3). The crotonaldehyde conversion over three catalysts reaches 100% at 3 h, but catalytic selectivity shows an obvious difference. The crotonaldehyde conversion over the three catalysts reaches 100% at 3 h, and the reaction rates are 88.2, 85.1 and 83.6 mmol g−1 h−1 in the presence of Ni, NiSb and NiBi, respectively (Fig. 3 A), indicating a close catalytic activity. However, the catalytic selectivity shows an obvious difference. The monometallic Ni prefers to simultaneously hydrogenate C = C and C = O, and thus produces saturated alcohol (1-butanol, selectivity: 89.8%). The selectivity toward crotyl alcohol (desired product) and 1-butyraldehyde are 6.3% and 3.9%, respectively. In contrast, the formation of 1-butanol is obviously inhibited over Ni-based IMCs, with a highly depressed selectivity of 12.5% (NiSb) and 2.8% (NiBi), respectively. Nevertheless, the selectivity toward desired product (crotyl alcohol) displays a significant enhancement in following sequence: Ni (6.3%) < NiSb (75.3%) < NiBi (97.2%). The catalytic performance of selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over NiBi IMCs stands among the highest level compared with previously reported samples (Table S1), demonstrating a preferential hydrogenation of C = O rather than C = C. The selectivity of crotyl alcohol still maintains above 93.0% after 6 h (Fig. 3A), due to the difficulty of further C = C hydrogenation. The catalytic behavior of NiBi IMCs was also performed in intermolecular competitive hydrogenation. Herein, a 1:1 mixture of crotyl alcohol and 1-butyraldehyde was studied as unsaturated alcohol and saturated aldehyde, respectively (Fig. 3B). When the content of 1-butyraldehyde decreases to 3.0%, only 5.0% of crotyl alcohol is hydrogenated to 1-butanol. This indicates that the hydrogenation of C = O is more favorable than that of C = C over NiBi IMCs. Thus, NiBi IMCs is capable of preferential hydrogenation of terminal C = O not only intramolecularly but also intermolecularly. Moreover, reusability of NiBi IMCs was evaluated by six-time recycles (Fig. 3C). The conversion of crotonaldehyde still maintains above 95% and selectivity of crotyl alcohol displays a little reduction from 97.0% to 95.0% after six-time recycles. XRD pattern and TEM image of used sample after six-time recycles do not display the change compared with fresh one, illuminating a good stability of NiBi IMCs (Figs. S6 and S7). In order to further study the versatility of Ni-based IMCs, several different types of unsaturated aldehydes were also performed as substrates under the optimized condition, and these consequences are given in Table 1. In the presence of NiBi catalyst, unsaturated aldehyde with substituent group, such as 3-methyl-2-butenal, converts into corresponding unsaturated alcohol in good selectivity (93.2%) (Table 1, entry 6). 2-Pentenal is hydrogenated to 2-pentenol with a high selectivity (94.5%) (Table 1, entry 9). The hydrogenation of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural give furfuryl alcohol and 5-hydroxymethyl furfuryl alcohol (97.7% and 97.9%; entry 12 and 15), respectively, both of which are vital intermediates in synthesis of a wide variety of chemicals [42,43]. Moreover, NiBi IMCs displays surprisingly high catalytic selectivity (98.9%) (Table 1, entry 18) toward cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation to cinnamyl alcohol. In a marked contrast, hydrogenation of CC and CO occur simultaneously over monometallic Ni, without selectivity toward formation of unsaturated alcohols. In addition, NiBi IMCs also exhibits a higher selectivity toward unsaturated alcohols in selective hydrogenation of various unsaturated aldehydes, in comparison with NiSb IMCs (Table 1, entry 2, 5, 8, 11, 14 and 17)."
9,Discussion on structure-selectivity relationship,"3.3 Discussion on structure-selectivity relationship The detailed structural information of monometallic Ni and Ni-based IMCs, including bond distance, coordination number and Debye-Waller factor, was explored by the FT k3-weighted EXAFS spectra at the Ni K-edge and corresponding curve-fitting consequence [44]. Fig. 4 A displays normalized XANES spectra of monometallic Ni and Ni-based IMCs. Notably, Fourier transform of Ni K-edge EXAFS (Fig. 4B) is used to study the atomic configuration of these catalysts, and thus fitting results are listed in Table S2. From Ni to Ni-based IMCs (Fig. 4A), absorption edge of Ni K-edge shifts to high photon-energy with an increased intensity of white line, indicating a decreased electronegativity of Ni owing to electron transfer from Ni atoms to adjacent Sb or Bi atoms. The intensity of first nearest-neighbor distance of Ni-based IMCs reduces relative to monometallic Ni, indicative of a decreased Ni–Ni coordination due to introduction of Sb or Bi. The curve-fitting data reveals that Ni–Ni coordination number reduces from 10 (Ni sample) to 3 in NiSb and NiBi samples; and these two Ni-based IMCs show same coordination number of 5 for Ni–Sb or Ni–Bi (Table S2). The Ni − Ni length enhances from Ni (2.483 Å) to NiSb (2.587 Å) and then to NiBi (3.523 Å) (Table S2), indicating an obviously decreased Ni − Ni bond induced by geometrical separation effect in Ni-based IMCs, in accordance with the result of HAADF-STEM. In order to offer a deep viewpoint in surface structure, in situ FT-IR of CO adsorption over monometallic Ni and NiBi IMCs were carried out (Fig. 4C and D). Typically, two different adsorption configurations of CO occur on Ni atom: below 2000 cm―1 (multi-coordinated adsorption) and above 2000 cm―1 (linear adsorption) [45]; however, CO adsorption on Bi atom can not be tested. Herein, in spectra of CO adsorption over monometallic Ni (Fig. 4C), both multi-coordinated adsorption (1643 cm―1) and linear adsorption (2045 cm―1) are discovered. In the case of NiBi IMCs (Fig. 4D), only linear adsorption peak of CO is found, with a blue-shift to 2052 cm―1. This is ascribed to the electronic effect [46,47]: a gradually reduced electron density of Ni decreases electron back-donation from d orbitals of Ni to π* orbital of CO, resulting in a weakened strength of CO chemiadsorption and thus an enhanced ν(CO) (blue-shift). The result accords well with the electron transfer from Ni to Bi as confirmed by XANES. In addition, from insight of geometry structure, introduction of Bi separates continuous Ni atoms and simultaneously enhances Ni―Ni length in NiBi IMCs, which thus inhibits multi-coordinated adsorption of CO. The intensity of Ni white line (Fig. 4A) for these Ni-based IMCs samples is close, indicating a similar degree of electronic structure. On the contrary, the Ni − Ni bond length (Table S2) increases obviously from Ni (2.483 Å) to NiSb (2.587 Å) and then to NiBi (3.523 Å), due to the separation effect of Sb or Bi, as confirmed by HAADF-STEM, XAFS and in situ FT-IR of CO adsorption. Therefore, the change of Ni − Ni bond length (geometric structure) is the main factor affecting the adsorption configuration and catalytic selectivity. In situ FT-IR, as a significant characterization, can offer detailed evidence on substrate adsorption, reaction intermediate, and even the surface structure of catalyst [48]. Thus, we performed in situ FT-IR to study adsorption structure of three representative reactants (crotonaldehyde, furfural and cinnamaldehyde) over monometallic Ni and NiBi IMCs (Fig. 5 ). Pure substrate was inlet into in situ reactor with CaF2 window at 100 °C for 30 min, followed by flowing He for chemical adsorption. As for Ni (Fig. 5A1, B1 and C1), a rather strong band is observed at 1650―1700 cm―1, which can be ascribed to ν(CO) [49]. In the case of NiBi IMCs (Fig. 5D1, E1 and F1), ν(CO) displays an obvious red-shift, indicating a stronger chemical adsorption of CO over NiBi IMCs. In addition, two additional peaks within 1550―1650 cm―1 appear, which can be ascribed to ν(CC) in unsaturated aldehydes [49]. Whereas, these two bands are not found in Ni sample, owing to different adsorption modes between ν(CO) and ν(CC). Typically, CO linear adsorption on sample surface results in a significant red-shift in ν(CO); whilst CC experiences bridge adsorption, leading to absence of ν(CC). Thus, the above results demonstrate activation of both CC and CO occurs over monometallic Ni, with observations of ν(CO) but absence of ν(CC). In contrast, only CO experiences activation over NiBi IMCs, in which adsorbed ν(CO) and free state ν(CC) are observed. In order to further study hydrogenation process on the surface of monometallic Ni and NiBi IMCs by monitoring intermediates and products, we sequentially purged H2 into in situ reactor. For Ni sample, the bands of CO decline gradually; and a new peak at 1050―1100 cm―1 (Fig. 5A2, B2 and C2) attributed to alcohol CO is found with hydrogen continuous inflow, indicating a hydrogenation progress of CO bond. Moreover, free state ν(CC) is still not detected. The above results verify a simultaneous CC and CO hydrogenation over monometallic Ni. In the case of NiBi IMCs, the strong peak of CO reduces progressively, and a new peak (Fig. 5D2, E2 and F2) is found at 180 s with a rather strong intensity. Nevertheless, signal of CC do not show significant decrease within 0―180 s, excluding CC hydrogenation process. With a continuous hydrogen inflow, both signals of CC and alcohol CO decrease gradually and disappear totally at 600 s, illustrating desorption of unsaturated alcohols from sample surface instead of further hydrogenation. In situ FT-IR characterization confirms that CO (not CC) undergoes hydrogenation over NiBi IMCs to produce unsaturated alcohols, in accord with result of catalytic evaluation. The metal bond length plays a key role in the adsorption configuration of substrate, which determines catalytic selectivity. A long Ni − Ni bond length is more favorable for linear adsorption of unsaturated aldehydes instead of bridge adsorption [50]. In this work, the Ni − Ni bond length (Table S2) increases gradually from Ni (2.483 Å) to NiSb (2.587 Å) and then to NiBi (3.523 Å), resulting from the separation effect of Sb or Bi. Both linear adsorption and bridge adsorption occur over NiSb IMCs; in contrast, only CO bond experiences a linear adsorption via terminal O over NiBi IMCs (Fig. 5D, E and F). Therefore, NiBi IMCs shows a higher selectivity toward unsaturated alcohols, in comparison with NiSb IMCs, which accords well with the consequence of catalytic performance. To further study on active site and adsorption mode, a comparative DFT calculation was performed on Ni and NiBi IMCs to uncover the correlation between adsorption structure of substrate and catalytic selectivity [51]. For selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes, the competitive activated adsorption of CC and CO imposes a decisive effect on the formation of the final product. The initial adsorption state of substrate is dependent on adsorption energy (E ad) of various adsorption configurations. Then, the adsorption configuration of substrate determines the catalytic selectivity and reaction pathway [8,51]. The most preferential and stable planes, Ni(111) and NiBi(101) facet, were chosen for calculation on the basis of their XRD and HRTEM (Fig. S1). We focus on the adsorption configuration and energies of substrate molecules at the two surfaces. CC and CO of crotonaldehyde experience activation over Ni(111) with an E ad of ―1.37 eV (Fig. 6 A1), leading to simultaneous CC and CO hydrogenation to produce 1-butanol. That is according with result of in situ FT-IR spectra. Moreover, activation of CC and CO in furfural and cinnamaldehyde occurs over monometallic Ni with an E ad of ―1.57 and ―2.44 eV (Fig. 6A2 and A3), respectively, which causes the undesired product―saturated alcohols. In the case of NiBi IMCs, a vertical adsorption configuration (via terminal O in CO connecting to Ni) of crotonaldehyde is observed at the surface of NiBi IMCs with an E ad of ―0.34 eV (Fig. 6B1), leading to CO hydrogenation to produce crotyl alcohol. Similarly, only CO in furfural and cinnamaldehyde is activated (E ad: ―0.37 and 0.09 eV) whilst the adsorption of CC bond is inhibited (Fig. 6B2 and B3), which determines the product selectivity toward unsaturated alcohols. This rule is also demonstrated in other unsaturated aldehydes (3-methyl-2-butenal, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and 2-pentenal) at the surface of Ni(111) and NiBi (101) (Fig. S8). The activation adsorption (lying adsorption) of unsaturated groups occurs on smooth surface of monometallic Ni, leading to CC and CO hydrogenation. In contrast, the rugged and ordered surface atomic arrangement of NiBi IMCs with a steric hindering effect induces a vertical adsorption configuration of unsaturated aldehydes (via linear adsorption of CO), which results in CO hydrogenation and the production of unsaturated alcohols."
10,Conclusion,"In this study, Ni-based IMCs (NiSb and NiBi) with ordered atomic arrangement were synthesized via structural transformation from LDHs precursor. The as-synthesized NiBi IMCs shows universal selectivity for CO hydrogenation in unsaturated aldehydes, and various unsaturated aldehydes can be converted into corresponding unsaturated alcohols in high selectivity. For monometallic Ni, activation of CC and CO bond occur on sample surface (lying adsorption), resulting in the production of saturated alcohols. In contrast, rugged and ordered surface atomic structure of NiBi IMCs with a steric hindering effect induces a vertical configuration of unsaturated aldehydes via CO activation adsorption, and thus determines selectivity of unsaturated alcohols. This strategy provides great prospect for Ni-based IMCs as efficient materials toward selective hydrogenation reactions of unsaturated carbonyl compounds."
