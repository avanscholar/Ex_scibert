0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic CO2 reduction into high value added chemicals and fuels is of great prospect due to the potential for mitigating energy crisis and environment issues [1–15]. Inspired by natural photosynthesis system, great efforts have been devoted to achieving CO2 photoreduction with H2O as electron source, which represents an appealing approach to implement sustainable carbon cycle in the artificial photosynthesis [16–20]. Among the reduction products of CO2, including CO, CH4, HCOOH, alcohols and aldehydes, alcohols such as CH3OH and CH3CH2OH are of great significance owing to high energy density, easy storage transportation and important industrial raw materials [21,22]. However, the efficiency of desirable products is far from satisfactory, especially for the multi-electron-transfer products of alcohols with numerous additional requirements. For example, as the simplest alcohol, methanol is already a six-electron reduction product, whereas C2+ oxygenates not only require more electron transfer but also insure the formation of CC bonds while retaining some of the CO bonds. Up to date, it is already a long-term and extremely promising task to explore novel photocatalytic systems for achieving efficient CO2-to-alcohols conversion in pure water, however remains a significant challenge during the artificial photosynthesis, especially for the conversion of CO2 to C2+ alcohols. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with periodic permanent porosity, tunable microstructure and highly conjugated structure [23–27], have emerged as a class of ideal platforms to integrate various functional components for CO2 photoreduction. In this field, crystalline porphyrin-tetrathiafulvalene COFs have been utilized to drive CO2 photoreduction to CO with a yield of 2.06 μmol g−1 h−1 [28]. Azine-based COFs served as photocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 at 0.4 MPa and 80 °C with a CH3OH yield of 13.7 μmol g−1 in 24 h [29]. To further improve the performance, porous COFs were used as the supports to encapsulate additional active sites for the synergistic catalytic reduction of CO2. Zou et al. emphasized that 2,2′-bipyridine-based COF bearing single Ni sites was applied to the selective photoreduction of CO2 with a CO yield of 4057 μmol g−1 in the presence of photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 and electron donor triethanolamine [30]. The M-PCD@TD-COF hosting metalloporphyrin-based carbon dots was used as heterogeneous catalyst for CO2-to-CO conversion with [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 and triethanolamine [31]. Obviously, the products were usually two-electron-transfer species, such as CO and HCOOH, and required additional photosensitizers and sacrificial agents. To achieve efficient artificial photosynthesis, various efforts have devoted to integration of catalytic active sites and light-harvesting units into porous frameworks, such as COFs and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) to avoid additional photosensitizers and electron sacrificial agents for CO2 photoreduction [32]. Especially, COFs are well-known with high thermal/chemical stability due to the covalent bonding [33,34]. Therefore, engineering the electronic properties of COFs will provide a promising approach to achieve optimized kinetics for overall CO2 photoreduction and H2O oxidation. Construction of ultrafine nanoclusters (NCs) has provided a unique opportunity to improve driving force for numerous reactions by modifying chemical component, cluster size and cluster-support interaction. The ultrafine NCs with low-coordinated surface metal centers have shown widely catalytic applications, such as CO2 activation and H2O splitting [35–38]. Unfortunately, the ultrafine NCs exhibited strong agglomeration tendency during the catalytic process resulting in obvious loss of catalytic activity [39]. In this regard, nanocatalysts have been uniformly dispersed various supports, such as palladium (Pd) and indium (In)-based catalysts [40–43]. Furthermore, PdIn-based bimetallic catalysts were used for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol at 50 bar and 300 °C with remarkably enhanced performance compared with monometallic counterparts [44]. However, the CO2 hydrogenation usually required harsh conditions with high temperature and pressure to achieve CO2-to-alcohols conversion. The excessive energy consumption of conventional catalysis prompts scientists to develop clean and energy-saving catalytic systems for CO2 utilization urgently. Solar-driven CO2-to-alcohols conversion is considered as a promising way to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks via the utilization of abundant and clean solar energy. Accordingly, functionally combining bimetallic NCs with photosensitizing COFs may provide a great potential to construct efficient photocatalytic systems for CO2-to-alcohols conversion. Herein, the photosensitizing N3-COF was firstly used for confined-growth of ultrafine bimetallic PdIn NCs, resulting in a series of PdxIny@N3-COF composites for simultaneously catalyzing CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation into alcohols. The Pd:In molar ratio in these PdxIny@N3-COF composites can be facilely adjusted via changing the loading amount of metal source (x:y = 1:0, 0:1, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1). Among these composites, PdIn@N3-COF shows the best performance for alcohols production with a total yield of 798 μmol g−1 in 24 h (CH3OH 74 %, and CH3CH2OH 26 %), 9.7 times higher than that of the isolated N3-COF. The excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to the bimetallic synergy and optimized kinetics achieved by confining PdIn NCs in the photosensitizing N3-COF. The bimetallic synergy is beneficial to stabilize active C1 intermediates for further coupling to generate C2+ product. As far as we know, this is the first COF-based photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction with H2O oxidation to produce ethanol."

3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis Synthesis of N3-COF: The synthesis of N3-COF was based on previously reported literature with some modification [45]. In a 15 mL pressure-resistant glass vial, 2,4,6-Tris(4-formylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (150 mg, 0.39 mmol) was dispersed into a mixed solution of mesitylene (3.0 mL), 1,4-dioxane (3.0 mL) and acetic acid aqueous solution (6 M, 300 μL). Then, hydrazine hydrate (50 % solution, 60 μL) was added into the above mixture immediately. Noting that the whole process of adding reactants, the reaction vial was in argon atmosphere. The vial was then sealed and heated in 120 °C for 72 h at autogenous pressure. After the reaction, product was filtered, washed with chloroform (10 mL × 3), acetone (10 mL × 3), and THF (10 mL × 3), and finally dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h to get N3-COF as light yellow powder. Synthesis of PdxIny@N3-COF: The prepared N3-COF (55 mg) was suspended in n-hexane (40 mL) and evenly dispersed by ultrasound at room temperature for 5 min. Subsequently, a Pd2+ and In3+ aqueous precursor solution with the Pd/In molar ratio of x:y = 1:0, 0:1, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1 (total mole was 0.024 mmol, 200 μL) was added dropwise under vigorous stirring. The resulting mixture was stirred for 12 h and filtered. Then, the precipitate was dried under vacuum at 60 °C, followed by dispersing it into methanol (40 mL). A solution of NaBH4 (0.25 M, 16 mL) was added dropwise into the above solution, and kept stirring for 48 h. The product was collected through centrifugation, then washed with CH2Cl2 for several times, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C. Finally, the resulting composite was activated in tube furnace at 200 °C for 1.5 h under the 6 % H2/Ar (vol %) atmosphere to remove organic impurities adsorbed on the surface of materials."
4,Photocatalytic reaction,"2.3 Photocatalytic reaction Photocatalytic CO2 reduction was performed in a double-walled 80 mL quartz photoreactor equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. All the catalysts were activated in tube furnace at 200 °C for 1.5 h under the 6 % H2/Ar (vol %) before the reaction. 2 mg of catalyst was well dispersed in 10 mL ultrapure water and ultrasonic for 10 min. The photoreactor was purged with CO2 (≥ 99.995 %) for 40 min to achieve CO2 saturation and remove O2 before the reaction. A 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300, CEAULICHT) with a 400 nm filter was used as light source. The collected gaseous products were detected using SHIMADZU GC-2014 gas chromatograph instrument with TCD and FID dual detectors. The liquid products of CH3OH and CH3CH2OH were detected using gas chromatograph equipped with KB-INNOWax capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) detected by FID after the reaction. The isotopic 13CO2 labeling experiment was performed under the similar condition, and the liquid products were determined by 13C NMR (AVANCE III HD 100 MHz). The isotopic H2 18O labeling experiment was performed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer GC–MS (Hiden Analytical HPR20)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Synthesis and characterization,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization Ultrafine PdxIny NCs confined in a photosensitizing COF was facilely achieved by a double solvents method, via changing the loading amount of metal source (Pd:In molar ratio of x:y = 1:0, 0:1, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1). As shown in Fig. 1 a, the N3-COF was synthesized by the condensation reaction between 2,4,6-Tris(4-formylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (N3-Ald) and hydrazine hydrate in mesitylene/1,4-dioxane according to the literature method. Then, the metal cations were introduced into the pores of N3-COF following by reduction of NaBH4 to construct ultrafine PdxIny NCs. Subsequently, the resulting composites were activated in 6 % H2/Ar (vol %) to remove organic impurities that may be adsorbed on the surface of materials. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of PdIn@N3-COF revealed that the ultrafine PdIn NCs were immobilized in the N3-COF support (Fig. 1b) with the average size of approximately 2.3 nm in diameter (inset of Fig. 1c), which was close to the pore diameter of N3-COF (2.4 nm). The size of PdIn NCs can be easily tuned by regulating the loading amount of Pd and In sources during the synthesis. PdIn NCs became smaller under lower loading of the metal sources, and their size can be reduced to 1.6 nm when the amount of Pd and In sources were halved (L-PdIn@N3-COF) (Fig. S1). The TEM images of N3-COF and PdxIny@N3-COF were supplied in Fig. S1, indicating successful preparation of the PdxIny@N3-COF composites. As illustrated in Fig. 1d, the lattice spacing of these NCs was 0.229 nm assigned to the (110) plane of PdIn alloy [46], illustrating the formation of PdIn NCs in the N3-COF support. Energy dispersed spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images demonstrated that Pd and In were uniformly distributed in N3-COF (Fig. S2). High resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) images revealed that the block composite of PdIn@N3-COF was stacked by nanosheets (Fig. S3). To further verify the distribution of PdIn NCs in the N3-COF, spherical aberration correction HRTEM was performed to determine the structure of PdIn@N3-COF with the balance between high resolution and electron beam damage. Hexagonal PdIn NCs with lattice spacing of 0.229 nm were obviously detected, revealing the successful encapsulation of PdIn NCs into the pores of N3-COF (Fig. 1e and f). Atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) also gave the hexagonal shape of PdIn NCs (Fig. 1g). The EDS mapping images clearly figured out the well-defined spatial distribution of Pd and In, which can be obviously observed that most Pd and In elements distributed in the same area, further confirming the formation of bimetallic PdIn NCs (Fig. 1h). These results demonstrated successfully immobilizing ultrafine PdIn NCs by the confined-growth of NCs in an existing confined region. The structure of N3-COF and PdIn@N3-COF was further studied by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). As shown in Fig. 2 a, the PXRD of N3-COF shows an intense (100) reflection at 2θ = 3.52°, and a diffraction peak at 6.0° corresponding to the (110) reflection. Similar PXRD pattern of PdIn@N3-COF and N3-COF confirmed that the structural integrity of N3-COF was well-preserved after the introduction of PdIn NCs. The characteristic peaks of bimetallic NCs cannot be observed in the PXRD of PdIn@N3-COF, probably ascribed to the formation of ultrafine NCs in the confined space. Further, no obvious peak corresponding to metal NCs can be detected in the PXRD of all the PdxIny@N3-COF composites, indicating the universality of synthetic strategy (Fig. S4). In the Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of N3-COF, the peak of CO stretching vibration at 1700 cm−1 weakened obviously while the CN stretching vibration peak at 1622 cm−1 emerged compared with that of N3-Ald. These results distinctly demonstrated the formation of azine-based N3-COF (Fig. 2b). The FTIR of PdIn@N3-COF was consistent with the pattern of N3-COF, suggesting no distinct change of the CN bond after introduction of PdIn NCs into N3-COF (Figs. 2b and S5). The microporosity of PdIn@N3-COF was confirmed by N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 100.46 m2 g−1 (Fig. S6), which facilitated the diffusion of reactants and products. Meanwhile, the CO2 adsorption capacity of PdIn@N3-COF was improved, although partial pores of N3-COF have been occupied by the PdIn NCs, revealing the strong affinity between PdIn NCs and CO2 molecules (Fig. 2c). The DFT calculation of CO2 adsorption on Pd and In centers further confirmed the above conclusion (Fig. S7). Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) further confirmed that the experimental content of Pd and In can be adjusted via changing the loading amount of the metal source during synthetic procedure (Table S1). The loadings of Pd and In in PdIn@N3-COF were determined to be 4.51 and 5.01 wt%, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) illustrated that the N3-COF and PdIn@N3-COF were stable up to 350 °C under N2 atmosphere (Fig. 2d). However, the weight-loss of PdIn@N3-COF was much lower than that of N3-COF, indicating the successful loading of PdIn NCs in the N3-COF. Further, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to verify the surface electronic states and PdIn bimetallic interaction in PdIn@N3-COF (Figs. 2e, f and S8). The peaks at 340.8 and 335.5 eV in the XPS spectra of Pd@N3-COF were attributed to Pd0 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, respectively, and two very weak peaks located at 342.0 and 336.7 eV can be indexed as Pd2+ 3d3/2 and 3d5/2. Simultaneously, the In 3d XPS spectrum of In@N3-COF obviously showed the existence of In with the typical binding energy at 452.6 and 445.1 eV, corresponding to In3+ 3d3/2 and 3d5/2. The other two peaks located at 451.9 and 444.4 eV can be indexed as In0 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, respectively (Fig. 2f) [47]. When bimetallic PdIn NCs were encapsulated into the N3-COF, the binding energy of Pd0 and Pd2+ shifted toward higher energy, and the peaks corresponding to Pd2+ 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 became much stronger compared to that of Pd@N3-COF. The binding energy of In shifted slightly to lower energy. These results demonstrated the electron transfer between Pd and In in the bimetallic NCs [48], and the existence of strong interaction in PdIn NCs, which was favorable for the electron transfer in PdIn@N3-COF."
7,Photoreduction CO2 and H2O oxidation,"3.2 Photoreduction CO2 and H2O oxidation Photocatalytic CO2 reduction of as-prepared PdxIny@N3-COF was performed in pure water without any other electron sacrificial agents. The 1H NMR and GC were used to quantitatively determine the products with optimized concentration of the catalyst (Fig. S9-S12). As depicted by Fig. 3 a, CO2 photoreduction with Pd@N3-COF and In@N3-COF as the photocatalysts generated CH3OH as the dominant product, and the yields of CH3OH were 295 and 341 μmol g−1. Further, the performance of all catalysts were remarkably enhanced by replacing Pd or In NCs with bimetallic PdIn NCs. Specifically, the CH3CH2OH can be produced in the presence of bimetallic PdIn NCs in the N3-COF, and a total yield 798 μmol g−1 in 24 h of CH3OH (74 %) and CH3CH2OH (26 %) was achieved by PdIn@N3-COF (Fig. S13). This performance was much superior to the Pd@N3-COF and In@N3-COF, ca. 9.7 times higher than that of N3-COF, reaching a high value among these reported COF and MOF-based photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2-to-alcohols conversion with H2O oxidation (Table S2). As well known, most products of the COF and MOF-based photocatalysts were gaseous products, and very few liquid products of alcohols can be generated. However, the reduction products of PdxIny@N3-COF composites were mainly liquid products of alcohols, only trace amount of gaseous products can be detected (Fig. S14). Especially, the C2+ product can only be generated in the presence of bimetallic PdIn NCs, which obviously demonstrated the bimetallic synergy in ultrafine NCs. Time-dependent accumulative production of CH3OH and CH3CH2OH almost increased linearly with time (Fig. 3b). Concurrently, time-dependent O2 production was linearly increasing as well (Fig. S15). The recyclability of catalyst was tested for four cycles (Fig. 3c), indicating the amount of liquid products displayed slight decrease but still maintained a high yield, possibly owing to the loss of photocatalyst during recycling experiments. The HRTEM, FTIR and XPS spectra of PdIn@N3-COF after photocatalysis remained consistent with the pristine sample (Fig. S16−18), indicating a robust catalyst of PdIn@N3-COF for CO2 photoreduction. Isotopic 13CO2, H2 18O labeling experiments and the control experiments by replacing CO2 with Ar gas were carried out under the similar condition to confirm the origin of reduction products of CH3OH, CH3CH2OH and oxidation product of O2. The isotopic 13CO2 labeling experiment indicated that 13CH3OH and 13CH3 13CH2OH can be observed in 13C NMR with 13CO2 as the carbon source in the photocatalytic system (Fig. S19). By addition of H2 18O into the reaction system, a m/z signal of 36 corresponding to 18O2 can be obviously detected by the gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC–MS), implying H2O as electron source for the CO2 photoreduction (Fig. 3d). At the same time, when Ar was used to replace the CO2 in the control experiment, it was almost impossible to detect the oxidation and reduction products. All these results confirmed that alcohol products derived from the photoreduction of CO2 exclusively, rather than the decomposition of the composites, further demonstrating the stability of catalyst during photocatalytic process."
8,Mechanism of CO2 photoreduction,"3.3 Mechanism of CO2 photoreduction The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of PdxIny@N3-COF demonstrated that PdIn@N3-COF possessed the smallest electrochemical impedance among all prepared materials (Fig. 4 a). Meanwhile, transient photocurrent response was consistent with EIS results that PdIn@N3-COF displayed the largest photocurrent intensity (Fig. 4b), and the introduction of In into the N3-COF facilitated intrinsic electron transfer. These results indicated that the introduction of ultrafine bimetallic NCs into the N3-COF facilitated intrinsic electron transfer during CO2 photoreduction. Further, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved PL decay spectra were employed to evaluate the charge separation efficiency (Figs. 4c and S20). As shown in Fig. 4c, the PL intensity of PdIn@N3-COF was significantly quenched compared to that of the isolated N3-COF, confirming the efficient charge separation in PdIn@N3-COF. As a comparison, the PL spectra of low-loading Pd@N3-COF (denoted as L-Pd@N3-COF) with a similar Pd content to that of PdIn@N3-COF was further studied, which showed an approximate quenching efficiency to PdIn@N3-COF. However, the PL intensity of In@N3-COF was slightly enhanced compared to that of PdIn@N3-COF, which concluded that the charge transfer to the Pd centers. Photoexcited charge carrier transfer dynamics was further investigated by time-resolved PL decay spectra (Fig. 4d). The PdIn@N3-COF possessed a much shorter fluorescence lifetime than that of N3-COF, indicating the swift electron transfer from N3-COF to PdIn catalytic sites during the photo-excitation. L-Pd@N3-COF with a similar Pd loading to that of PdIn@N3-COF was proved to possess of similar fluorescence lifetime, further confirming Pd centers that possibly received the photoexcited electrons. Simultaneously, the UV–vis spectra showed that no obvious increase for the light absorption of PdIn@N3-COF compared with the isolated N3-COF (Fig. S21). The above results revealed that efficient charge separation and bimetallic interaction in the PdIn@N3-COF contributed greatly to the outstanding performance for CO2 photoreduction. The flat-band potentials (corresponding to the conduction band edge) of N3-COF and PdIn@N3-COF were determined by Mott-Schottky measurement (Fig. S22). As shown in Fig. 5 a, their conduction band (CB) potentials were determined to be -1.23 and -1.32 V (vs NHE), indicating photogenerated electrons can be used for the reduction of CO2 to CH3OH (-0.38 V vs NHE) and CH3CH2OH (-0.33 V vs NHE) [49]. The valence band (VB) potentials were calculated to be +0.98 and +0.84 V, which was more positive than the potential of H2O/O2 (+0.82 V vs NHE). These results confirmed the thermodynamically permissible for both CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation. As a consequence, photogenerated electrons can rapidly transfer to catalytic active sites for CO2 reduction, while the holes were used to oxidize H2O molecules into O2 during the photocatalysis. To further clarify reaction mechanism, the in situ FTIR experiments were conducted on PdIn@N3-COF during the CO2 photoreduction process (Fig. 5b). Under the light irradiation, the signals of CH3CH2O* (2970 cm−1), CH3O* (2943 cm−1), CHO* (2620 cm−1), CO* (2248 cm−1), CH3CHO* (1700 cm−1) and COOH* (1535 cm−1) emerged and enhanced gradually with the increase of irradiation time [50–53]. Accordingly, the possible mechanism for CO2 photoreduction with H2O as the electron source was proposed as following (Fig. 5c and d): the pathways of CO2→CO*→CHO*→CH2O*→CH3O*→CH3OH for methanol production [54], and CO2→CO*→CHO*→CO* insertion→CHOCO*→multi-step H++e- process→ CH3CH2O*→CH3CH2OH for the ethanol evolution were proposed [55]. This study revealed that photocatalysts with dual reactive sites greatly contributed to the CC bond coupling and possessed great potential to realize the conversion of CO2-to-alcohols. The synergetic effect of PdIn@N3-COF facilitated the coupling of key intermediates (CO* and CHO*) and the subsequent proton-electron transfer, resulting in CC bond coupling and superior catalytic performance."
9,Conclusion,"In conclusion, a feasible strategy for encapsulating highly active and ultrafine PdIn bimetallic NCs into photosensitizing N3-COF was developed, resulting in a series of PdxIny@N3-COF composites. These composites can be used for efficient CO2 photoreduction to alcohols with H2O as the electron source. The synergistic effect in the PdIn@N3-COF leaded to a record-high total yield for the conversion of CO2-to-alcohols with H2O oxidation. Importantly, the production of CH3CH2OH was achieved as the bimetallic synergistic effect, which can stabilize active C1 intermediates for the CC coupling while retaining some of the CO bonds. The in situ FTIR spectra further confirmed the CC coupling and possible reaction pathway by discussing the surface species formed during the photocatalysis. This work highlights the amazing potential for immobilizing bimetallic NCs into photosensitizing supports to achieve the conversion of CO2 into multicarbon alcohols and improve the efficiency of artificial photosynthesis."
