0,Introduction,"Though activated sludge process has been invented for over 100 years, it is still the primary technology for sewage treatment in current times (Coello-Garcia et al., 2019; Hassard et al., 2018). During treatment, the byproduct waste activated sludge (WAS) is largely generated. The annual WAS yield was estimated to exceed 6 × 107 t by the year 2020 in China, which means huge expense is needed due to the high cost of traditional WAS treatment methods (Hu et al., 2020b; Wu et al., 2019). Anaerobic fermentation or digestion is a promising WAS treatment method because it can simultaneously reduce sludge mass and recycle useful bioproducts including volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alcohols, methane and hydrogen (Hu et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021). Such an eco-friendly process perfectly realized the concept of “waste-to-energy” (Habagil et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020). Among these bioproducts, hydrogen is a kind of clean energy source possessing high energy density (286 kJ/mol), thus utilizing WAS as substrate for biohydrogen production has become a research focus in recent years (Cai et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2019a; Wang et al., 2019b). In general, WAS anaerobic fermentation contains six steps, including disintegration, hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, homoacetogenesis, and methanogenesis, and hydrogen is largely generated in the acidogenesis and acetogenesis processes. The yield of hydrogen from sludge anaerobic fermentation however is usually very low, which was mainly attributed to the slow reaction rate of disintegration and hydrolysis processes in the initial period of fermentation. Thus, it is necessary to accelerate the slow processes by some pretreating technologies for enhancing biohydrogen yield from sludge. Freezing is an environmentally friendly technology for sludge pretreatment, which can effectively break sludge flocs and then release the grabbed organics into sludge liquor. Montusiewicz et al. (2010) found that freezing pretreatment efficiently facilitated sludge disintegration, for the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) was enhanced by 2.1 times after frozen at −25 °C for 1 d. She et al. (2020) reported that the sludge SCOD was markedly enhanced from 140.2 to 955.4 mg/L after treated with five freezing/thawing cycles, while volatile suspended solids (VSS) was reduced by 10.8% at the same time. Sun et al. (2018) found that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soluble extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of sludge was dramatically enhanced from 3.1 to 29.5 mg/g VSS when pretreated by freezing for 1 d under −5 °C environment. Though remarkable effects on sludge disintegration were achieved in the above-mentioned studies, the promotion in hydrogen yield by freezing pretreatment was still at a limited level. The latest work of Liu et al. (2020) illustrated that the biohydrogen production from sludge was enhanced from 1.5 to 6.4 mL/g VS after pretreated at −5 °C for 8 h, which was much lower than the production based on the pretreatment methods of free ammonia (Wang et al., 2018), calcium peroxide (Wang et al., 2019b) and alkali (Yang et al., 2020). As an intermediate product, hydrogen is rapidly consumed by sludge microbes including hydrogenotrophic methanogens, homoacetogens, and sulfate reducing bacteria after generation, which served as the primary reason for the low hydrogen production from sludge by freezing method. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt another method assisting freezing to further enhance sludge disintegration while reduce the consumption of hydrogen. As a strong oxidant, potassium ferrate (PF) has been largely adopted for sludge treatment (Limmun et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2012). In PF treating process, the strong oxidability of Fe(VI) can efficiently crack sludge EPS and microbial cells to release the abundant organics into the liquor phase of sludge (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018). For example, Wu et al. (2020) found that the VS of sludge was reduced by 50.3% after PF pretreatment when the mass ratio of sludge to PF was 15:4, and the concentrations of soluble polysaccharide and protein after 2 h reaction reached 1290.8 and 1844.2 mg/L, respectively. Li et al. (2020a) adopted the co-treatment method of PF and alkaline to pretreat sludge, and the results show that the VSS was markedly decreased from 8870 to 6739 mg/L after 140 mg/g SS PF pretreatment under pH 11 environment, while the SCOD concentration was largely increased from about 250 to 2242.5 mg/L at the same time. The increased soluble organic matters are undoubtedly conducive to subsequent anaerobic fermentation or digestion process of sludge. Beyond that, Li et al. (2020b) reported that PF markedly inhibited the growth of some hydrogen consumers during sludge anaerobic fermentation. As a result, the hydrogen production was significantly enhanced from 1.47 to 8.35 mL/g VSS when PF dosage was 0.09 g/g TSS. Yang et al. (2020) investigated the combination of PF and alkaline methods for sludge pretreatment, and found that the biohydrogen yield was sufficiently enhanced from 2.7 to 19.2 mL/g VSS by the combined pretreatment. On the basis of the above analysis, we hypothesized that the hydrogen production would be synergistically promoted by combining PF with freezing pretreatment, because better disintegration effect, more biodegradable organics, and less hydrogen consumption are expected to be achieved when compared with individual PF or freezing pretreatment method. However, this issue has not been investigated till now. This study hence aims to investigate a novel sludge pretreatment method of combining PF with freezing for obtaining a synergistically enhanced biohydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation, and reveal the underlying mechanisms. Firstly, hydrogen production from sludge by freezing, PF, or freezing coupled with PF pretreatment was studied through the batch fermentative hydrogen producing experiment. Then, the mechanisms related to improved hydrogen production were revealed from the aspect of sludge disintegration, release of biodegradable organics, biochemical reaction kinetics and functional microbial abundances. At last, the dewatering performance of sludge with or without pretreatment was detected after fermentation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,WAS and PF,"2.1 WAS and PF The WAS samples were obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with 2 × 106 t/d design capacity in Shanghai, China. The samples were firstly filtrated by a 2.0 × 2.0 mm stainless steel sieve to eliminate impurities before fermentation experiments were conducted. The major physicochemical properties of raw WAS are displayed in Table 1 . PF with 98% purity was purchased from Aladdin company in Shanghai, China."
3,Pretreatment procedures of WAS,"2.2 Pretreatment procedures of WAS Sludge was pretreated in six replicated plastic beakers (600 mL working volume for each), named as reactor 1 to 6. At first, each reactor was added with 350 mL raw sludge. These reactors then were pretreated under different conditions, as described in Table 2 . In brief, reactor 1 served as the control that was only placed at 26 °C for 4 h without any pretreatment. Reactor 2 was conducted for individual freezing pretreatment, which was firstly frozen at −12 °C for 24 h and then thawed at 26 °C for 4 h. Reactor 3 for individual PF pretreatment was added with 1.3522 g PF to get the dosage of 0.15 g/g TSS, which was the optimum PF dosage for hydrogen production confirmed in our preliminary experiment (Fig. S1). After vigorously mixed using a magnetic stirrer for 30 min, this reactor was kept at 26 °C for 4 h before fermentation. The remaining reactors 4–6 were all for freezing combined with PF pretreatment, with different PF dosages of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 g/g TSS, respectively. After added with 0.4507, 0.9015, or 1.3522 g PF and immediately stirred as done with reactor 3, the three reactors were all frozen at −12 °C for 24 h and then thawed at 26 °C for 4 h. To better understand the differences among reactors 1–6 in the following context, the relevant sludge treatment conditions were respectively named as control, F (individual freezing), PF (individual potassium ferrate), F-PF1 (freezing + 0.05 g/g TSS PF), F-PF2 (freezing + 0.1 g/g TSS PF), and F-PF3 (freezing + 0.15 g/g TSS PF) (Table 2). When the pretreatments were completed, each reactor was extracted 50 mL of pretreated sludge for further analyses, and the rest sludge was used for the following fermentative hydrogen producing experiment."
4,Batch fermentative hydrogen producing experiment,"2.3 Batch fermentative hydrogen producing experiment Six serum bottles (each 500 mL) were used to carry out the fermentation experiment. Firstly, the six bottles were respectively added with 300 mL sludge from reactor 1–6 as performed in Section 2.2. Each bottle was then flushed with N2 for 5 min to replace the air. After sealed by rubber stoppers, these bottles were placed into a shaker (150 r/min, 35 °C) to initiate anaerobic fermentation reactions. All fermenters were not inoculated with any extra inoculums, and thus the fermentation reactions were drove by indigenous microbes in WAS. During the experiment, hydrogen content was periodically detected till it was not significantly generated. The total biogas volume was detected by replacing an acid solution (pH = 2) contained sulfuric. The accumulative hydrogen yield was calculated by Eq. (1). (1) V H , i = V H , i − 1 + C H , i × V G , i − C H , i − 1 × V G , i − 1 where, V H is the accumulative hydrogen yield, V G is the total gas volume, C H is the hydrogen content in biogas, i and i-1 represent the two sequential moments. When the fermentation was finished, the structures of microbial community in the control and F-PF3 pretreated fermenters were detected to reveal the mechanisms of how freezing coupled with PF pretreatments affect the fermentative hydrogen production from a micro-perspective. Moreover, the water content (Wc) and settling velocity (SV) of sludge mixture after fermentation in different reactors were measured."
5,Assessing the effect of pretreatment on WAS disintegration,"2.4 Assessing the effect of pretreatment on WAS disintegration The contents of SCOD, soluble protein and carbohydrate in each reactor after pretreatment were detected to assess the impact of different pretreatment conditions on sludge disintegration. Afterwards, the lightly bound EPS (LB-EPS) and tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS) of sludge in these reactors were respectively extracted according to the reference (Sun et al., 2018). The destruction of sludge EPS by pretreatment was revealed by detecting the protein and carbohydrate contents in the extracted EPS. To more intuitively exhibit the EPS dissolution and the release of organics, excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectra of sludge liquor, LB-EPS and TB-EPS were all measured, and the detailed parameters were illustrated in Text S1 (Supporting Information). Furthermore, live/dead staining tests were conducted using the Calcein-AM/PI Double Staining Kit (Dojindo Laboratories, Japan) to explore the destruction of microbial cells after pretreatments (Text S2)."
6,Evaluating the effect of pretreatment on biochemical processes related to hydrogen accumulation,"2.5 Evaluating the effect of pretreatment on biochemical processes related to hydrogen accumulation Except for disintegration, there are also several biochemical processes including hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, homoacetogenesis, sulfate-reducing and methanogenesis involved in sludge anaerobic fermentation, among which the first three processes are relevant to hydrogen generation, while the latter three are responsible for hydrogen consumption. Several batch tests utilizing model substrates hence were conducted to assess the effect of different pretreatments on each biochemical process. 16 serum bottles (each 500 mL) were used as fermenters and averagely classified into four groups, namely BSA-Test, Glucose-Test, Butyrate-Test and H2-CO2-SO4 2−-Test. 2.5.1 BSA-test This group has four fermenters, including a control and three pretreated fermenters (F, PF, and F-PF3). Each fermenter firstly received 270 mL synthetic wastewater contained 4.3 g/L BSA (bovine serum albumin). Then, the fermenters were respectively inoculated with 30 mL digested sludge as inoculum. It should be noted that except for the control fermenter without pretreatment and only kept at 26 °C for 4 h, the inoculums for other three fermenters were pretreated under different conditions before inoculation, which are consistent with the individual F, individual PF and F-PF3 as presented in Section 2.2. After that, all the fermenters were flushed with nitrogen gas and sealed for anaerobic fermentation, as introduced in Section 2.3. By detecting the degradation of BSA in different fermenters, the effect of different pretreatments on sludge hydrolysis was clarified. 2.5.2 Glucose-test This test was conducted the same as BSA-Test, except that BSA was replaced by 0.8 g/L glucose. 2.5.3 Butyrate-test All operations of this experiment were consistent with BSA-Test, apart from that 2 g/L sodium butyrate substituted BSA as the fermentation substrate. 2.5.4 H2-CO2-SO4 2−-test Each fermenter was firstly added with 270 mL synthetic wastewater containing 0.5 g/L potassium sulfate and 30 mL inoculum with or without pretreatment as described in BSA-Test. Afterwards, each fermenter was aerated with a mixed gas containing 50% N2, 10% CO2 and 40% H2 for 5 min. All other operating procedures were in accordance with that in BSA-Group."
7,Model-based analysis,"2.6 Model-based analysis When the batch hydrogen producing experiment was done, the hydrogen yield data from different fermenters were simulated using a modified Gompertz model (Eq. (2)). Three parameters H m, R m, and λ represent for hydrogen production potential (mL/g VSS), hydrogen production rate (mL/g VSS/h) and lag phase time (h), respectively, were computed by fitting the experimental data into Eq. (2) using Origin 8.0. (2) H = H m × exp − exp R m × e H m λ − t + 1 where, H is the accumulative hydrogen yield at time t (mL/g VSS), t is time (h), e is 2.718."
8,Analytical methods,"2.7 Analytical methods Protein and carbohydrate were detected according to the literatures (Herbert et al., 1971; Lowry et al., 1951). TCOD (total chemical oxygen demand), SCOD, TSS, and VSS were detected using standard methods (Rice et al., 2012). The content of sulfate was detected according to a previously published BaSO4 precipitation method (Aiking et al., 1982). Hydrogen and methane were determined by the method reported in our previous study (Hu et al., 2020a). Determination of VFAs was conducted by a gas chromatograph (9790Plus, Fuli company, China) which was matched with a capillary column (RB-FFAP, Fuli company, China), and ultra-pure N2 was served as the carrier gas. The oven was programmed to start at 100 °C and maintain for 2 min, then increase to 230 °C in 13 min and ultimately remain at 230 °C for 2 min, and the injection port and detector were both set as a constant temperature 250 °C. The images of stained live/dead cells were captured by a confocal fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i, Japan). Water content (Wc) and settling velocity (SV) were measured according to the literatures (Liu et al., 2016; Ye et al., 2012). Microbial community analysis was conducted based on Illumina MiSeq PF300 platform, with 338F (5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′) served as primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The sequencing data were classified into numerous operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of at least 97% sequence identity."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Effect of different pretreatments on hydrogen production from WAS anaerobic fermentation,"3.1 Effect of different pretreatments on hydrogen production from WAS anaerobic fermentation The cumulative hydrogen productions by different pretreatments are displayed in Fig. 1a. The hydrogen yield in the control fermenter without any pretreatment was very low (<2.1 mL/g VSS) during the entire experiment, due to the slow disintegration efficiency and rapid consumption of produced hydrogen (Wang et al., 2018). When pretreated by F or PF, the hydrogen production was significantly enhanced. The accumulative hydrogen productions from individual F and PF pretreated fermenters were both gradually increased in the initial 144 h fermentation, and then reached steady state (Fig. 1a). The maximum hydrogen yield in the fermenter by F or PF pretreatment was 5.37 and 9.32 mL/g VSS at 144 h, respectively, much higher than that of the control one (p value were respectively 0.0016 and 0.0004, Table S1). In F-PF3 pretreated fermenter, the yield of hydrogen was found to be further increased, compared to that by individual F or PF pretreatment. The optimum fermentation time and maximum hydrogen yield were respectively 132 h and 12.50 mL/g VSS in F-PF3 fermenter which was pretreated by freezing coupled with 0.15 g/g TSS PF (Fig. 1a). It is worth noting that the hydrogen production from F-PF2 fermenter (freezing + 0.1 g/g TSS PF) also surpassed that by individual 0.15 g/g TSS PF pretreatment. The maximum hydrogen production from F-PF2 fermenter was found to be 10.69 mL/g VSS at 156 h, significantly (p = 0.0477, Table S2) higher than that of 9.32 mL/g VSS from the PF fermenter (Fig. 1a). It can be seen that less PF was needed by combining with freezing method to achieve an equivalent even higher hydrogen production, which means the processing cost can be largely reduced because the price of PF is relatively high, while natural freezing is easily achieved. To better understand the effect of F coupled with PF pretreatment on fermentative hydrogen production from sludge, mathematical model-based analysis was conducted using a modified Gompertz model (Eq. (2)). The experimental biohydrogen yield data were perfectly fitted by this model (Fig. 1b) with R2 all larger than 0.99, and the relevant simulation parameters H m, R m and λ are given in Table 3 . The simulated H m in the control fermenter is only 2.14 mL/g VSS, while markedly increased to 6.06 and 10.53 mL/g VSS in the individual F and PF pretreated fermenters, respectively. R m shows similar tendency to H m. When pretreated by F coupled with PF, both H m and R m were further improved. In F-PF3 fermenter, simulated H m and R m are 13.52 mL/g VSS and 0.163 mL/g VSS/h, respectively, much higher than that by the individual F or PF pretreatment, suggesting that the hydrogen production potential and rate were both highly enhanced (Table 3). The analysis of both experimental and simulation results indicated that F combined with PF pretreatment exerted synergetic effect on hydrogen production from sludge. Hydrogen is usually generated synchronously with the production of VFAs, thus the COD mass balance in each fermenter was analyzed for comprehensively revealing the impact of F coupled with PF pretreatment on sludge anaerobic fermentation system, especially for VFAs accumulation. In Table 4 , the proportion of VFAs to TCOD in the control fermenter was only 2.2% after 252 h fermentation, which means the fermentation efficiency was rather low. When pretreated by F, PF, or F-PF3, the VFAs proportions were increased to 11.1%, 23.6%, and 27.3%, respectively. The variations of VFAs in different fermenters are consistent with that of hydrogen production, which occupied for 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5%, and 0.7% of TCOD in the control, F, PF, and F-PF3 pretreated fermenters, respectively. On the contrary, the proportions of VSS to TCOD decreased from 68.0% in the control fermenter to severally 61.7%, 59.5%, and 54.9% in the F, PF, and F-PF3 pretreated fermenters, indicating that more organics in sludge were utilized for producing bioproducts by these pretreatments (Table 4). The results above demonstrated that the co-pretreatment of F and PF not only promoted fermentative hydrogen and VFAs production, but also enhanced the utilization efficiency of fermentation substrates in sludge."
11,Effect of freezing coupled with PF pretreatment on WAS disintegration,"3.2 Effect of freezing coupled with PF pretreatment on WAS disintegration In sludge fermentation, the organics in solid phase need to be dissolved into sludge liquor at first through disintegration process. Fig. 2a exhibits the SCOD contents after pretreatment under different conditions, and it can be seen that the SCOD in pretreated reactors were all remarkably enhanced. SCOD in the reactors by individual F and PF pretreatment were detected to be 546.3 and 1066.5 mg/L, which are respectively 5.71 and 11.14 times of the control, indicating that the sludge disintegration was significantly promoted. When sludge was pretreated by F coupled with PF, the disintegration effect was further enhanced with the SCOD reached 1328.2 mg/L in F-PF3 reactor. Protein and carbohydrate are the primary biodegradable organics contained in sludge. After pretreatment, the release of protein and carbohydrate were measured (Fig. 2b), with similar variation tendency to SCOD (Fig. 2a). For example, the protein concentration in sludge liquor was enhanced from 56.8 to severally 321.1 and 578.3 mg COD/L after individual F and PF pretreatment, then increased to 726.0 mg COD/L by F-PF3 pretreatment. The sludge organics are mainly distributed in EPS with a proportion of 50–60%, while about 2–20% organics exist in microbial cells (Raszka et al., 2006; Wilen et al., 2003). To understand how dose F combined with PF pretreatment affect sludge disintegration, the protein and carbohydrate concentrations in sludge LB-EPS and TB-EPS from different pretreatment reactors were detected (Fig. 3 ). In Fig. 3a, the protein concentration in LB-EPS were enhanced from 154.1 to 170.5 and 241.6 mg COD/L after individual F and PF pretreatment, respectively. When pretreated by F-PF3, the content of protein was enhanced to 363.6 mg COD/L. By contrast, the protein content in TB-EPS was dramatically decreased after pretreatment, which was detected to be 853.1 and 520.1 mg COD/L in the control and F-PF3 reactors, respectively. Similar variation tendencies were observed on carbohydrate content in sludge EPS (Fig. 3b). The results above indicated that a considerable of sludge TB-EPS was damaged and then converted to LB-EPS or dissolved into sludge liquor by F-PF3 pretreatment. This finding was confirmed by EEM fluorescence spectra of sludge liquor (Fig. S2), LB-EPS and TB-EPS (Fig. S3). There were two peaks observed in each spectrum of sludge liquor from different reactors, named as Peak A and Peak B, respectively (Fig. S2). According to previous literatures (Chen et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2013), EEM fluorescence spectrum can be divided into five regions which represent different substrates, as summarized in Table S3. In our study, Peak A and Peak B severally located in the Ex/Em range of 285–290/340–350 and 340–370/415–455, which belong to Region IV and V denoted polysaccharide and humic acid like matters, respectively. In Fig. S2, the fluorescence intensities of Peak A and Peak B were both markedly enhanced after pretreatment, especially on the F-PF3 condition, indicating that the release of relevant substrates was effectively promoted. The EEM spectra of sludge EPS in Fig. S3 provide evidences for F-PF3 pretreatment effectively destroyed the EPS structure and reduced the recalcitrant TB-EPS. These results agree well with that deduced from Figs. 2 and 3. Fig. 4 demonstrates the fluorescence photos of stained sludge microbes before and after pretreatment, in which the fluorescent green represents live cells and fluorescent red refers to dead cells with damaged membranes. The green fluorescence intensity was obviously weakened after F, PF or F-PF3 pretreatment, whereas the red fluorescence intensity was distinctly enhanced. By detecting the specific intensity of green and red fluorescence, the proportions of live/dead cells to total cells were calculated. In Fig. S4, the fractions of live cells were sharply decreased from 88.6% to 11.7% and 5.4% by individual F and PF pretreatment, respectively, indicating that a great deal of microbial cells in sludge was damaged after pretreatment. When pretreated by F-PF3, the fraction of live cells was sharply reduced to 1.7%, which means more complete cell breakage was achieved. These results indicated that F-PF3 pretreatment not only effectively destroyed sludge EPS, but also markedly damaged the microbial cells, consequently resulting in the efficient promotion of sludge disintegration and more organics were released into sludge liquor (Fig. 2). The enhanced sludge disintegration hence served as an important reason for the increased hydrogen production (Fig. 1)."
12,Effects of freezing coupled with PF pretreatment on biochemical processes for hydrogen accumulation,"3.3 Effects of freezing coupled with PF pretreatment on biochemical processes for hydrogen accumulation The released organics from sludge disintegration are usually in macromolecular state, and need to be hydrolyzed into small molecular substances before utilized for biohydrogen production. Hydrogen is mainly produced in the following acidogenesis and acetogenesis steps, and then rapidly consumed for acetic acid, hydrogen sulfide and methane production through homoacetogenesis, sulfate-reducing and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis steps. The effects of different pretreatment conditions on each biochemical process are summarized in Table 5 . Except for acidogenesis, all other processes were found to be inhibited by F, PF or F-PF3 pretreatment. For example, the BSA degradation rate after 4 d fermentation was decreased from 76.4% to 69.0% and 66.9% by individual F and PF pretreatment, respectively. When pretreated by F-PF3, the degradation rate of BSA was further decreased to 62.3%, which means the hydrolysis was more severely suppressed. The same tendency was found in the degradations of butyrate, hydrogen and sulfate under different pretreatment conditions, with a sequence in inhibition effect of F < PF < F-PF3. Fig. 5 shows the specific degradation rates of these model substances in initial 4 d fermentation, and the variations of microbial activities responsible for each biochemical process after pretreatment were obtained by comparing the specific degradation rates. In Fig. 5a, no obvious distinction was observed in the specific degradation rate of glucose (p > 0.05), which means that the activity of microorganisms participated in acidogenesis process was unaffected by F, PF, or F-PF3 pretreatment. It can be also perceived from Fig. 5a that the activities of microbes participate in hydrolysis and acetogenesis processes were both slightly suppressed by F, PF, and F-PF3 pretreatment. The specific degradation rate of BSA without pretreatment was found to be 35.08 ± 1.7 mg/g VSS/h, which served as the original activity of hydrolytic microbes. After pretreated by F, PF, or F-PF3, the corresponding data were decreased to 31.68 ± 1.5, 30.72 ± 1.6, and 28.60 ± 1.3 mg/g VSS/h, respectively, indicating the activity of hydrolytic microorganisms was respectively suppressed by 9.7%, 12.4%, and 18.5%. By the same method, the activity of microorganisms responsible for acetogenesis process was calculated to be inhibited by 15.1% after F-PF3 pretreatment. Though inhibiting effects on microbial activities related to hydrolysis and acetogenesis processes by F-PF3 pretreatment were observed, the relative activities of 81.5% (hydrolytic microbes) and 84.9% (acetogenic microbes) were still measured (Fig. 5a). The results suggested that the processes related to hydrogen production were not or only slightly affected when pretreated by F-PF3. The consumption of hydrogen is another important factor for its accumulation. As demonstrated in Fig. 5b, the activity of hydrogen-consuming microbes was more critically suppressed compared with that for BSA and butyrate degradation. The specific degradation rate of hydrogen was reduced from 0.22 ± 0.02 mg/g VSS/h of the control one to 0.12 ± 0.01, 0.10 ± 0.01 and 0.07 ± 0.01 mg/g VSS/h by F, PF and F-PF3 pretreatment, respectively, which means the activity of hydrogen-consuming microbes was severally suppressed by 45.5%, 54.6%, and 69.8%. Hydrogen is mainly consumed by homoacetogenic microbes, sulfate-reducing microbes and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, for producing acetic acid, hydrogen sulfide and methane, respectively. From Fig. 5b, the activity of sulfate-reducing microbes was severely inhibited when pretreated by F-PF3, as the specific degradation rate of sulfate was sharply declined from 2.37 ± 0.12 to 0.53 ± 0.04 mg/g VSS/h after F-PF3 pretreatment, with 77.7% reduction. To find out the impact of pretreatments on homoacetogenic microbes and hydrogenotrophic methanogens activities, the generation of acetic acid and methane were also detected in H2-CO2-SO4 2−-Test (Table 5). It can be seen that methane on 2 d and 4 d fermentation was only detected in the fermenters without pretreatment, and the acetic acid production was significantly reduced after pretreatment especially under F-PF3 condition. The results indicated that the microbial activities related to the three hydrogen-consuming processes were all substantially suppressed by F-PF3 pretreatment, and the inhibiting extents were more serious than that for the hydrolysis and acetogenesis processes, which ultimately promoted the accumulation of hydrogen (Fig. 1). Fig. 5c shows the variations of methane production in each fermenter of the batch fermentative hydrogen producing experiment. The accumulative methane production was obviously decreased in all the pretreated fermenters, particularly under F-PF3 condition that was entirely suppressed through the whole 252 h fermentation. This result further elucidated that the activity of methanogens was restrained by combined F and PF pretreatment."
13,Effect of freezing coupled with PF pretreatment on microbial community,"3.4 Effect of freezing coupled with PF pretreatment on microbial community The structure and component of microbial community can exert profound effects on fermentative hydrogen production (Yang and Wang, 2019). The variations of microbial community between the control and F-PF3 pretreated fermenters were investigated in this study. The Venn diagram (Fig. S5) shows that the microbial OTUs was reduced from 1282 in the control one to 986 in F-PF3 fermenter, with 815 OTUs being shared, illuminating that the diversity of sludge microbes was decreased under F-PF3 condition. This result is well consistent with the observation in Fig. 4 that a large number of microbial cells were killed by F-PF3 pretreatment and served as the fermentation substrates for viable microbes. Fig. 6 demonstrates the microbial phylum level distributions in control and F-PF3 fermenters. The phyla in the two fermenters were mainly consisted of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, and Acidobacteriota, accounted for 86.6% and 94.2% of the total microbial community, respectively. Among these phyla, most of microbes belonged to Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota and Bacteroidota were found to possess the ability of producing VFAs and hydrogen by degrading various of organics (Huang et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2013). The total proportions of these four phyla in the control and F-PF3 fermenters were calculated. It was perceived from Fig. S6 that their abundance in F-PF3 fermenter was 80.8%, much higher than that in the control fermenter of 57.8%, consequently promoted hydrogen production during sludge fermentation (Fig. 1). The variations of anaerobic microbes between the control and F-PF3 fermenters at genus level were presented in Fig. 7 . Three hydrolytic genera, including Proteocatella, norank_f__Caldilineaceae, and Hyphomicrobium, were detected in both of the two fermenters. The total abundance of them in F-PF3 fermenter shared 8.9% of total bacteria, 3.56 times of that in the control one with 2.5%. Though the activities of hydrolytic microbes were slightly suppressed by F-PF3 pretreatment (Fig. 5a), their abundances were markedly improved due to the largely increased soluble organics after F-PF3 pretreatment (Fig. 2). Beside hydrolytic bacteria, there are also several genera responsible for VFAs and hydrogen production detected in the two fermenters, including Sedimentibacter, Tissierella, Romboutsia, Petrimonas, Proteiniclasticum, and norank_f__norank_o__Saccharimonadales. Fig. 7 shows that the six genera were all enriched in F-PF3 fermenter compared to the control one. For instance, Sedimentibacter was reported to possess the ability to degrade amino acids for VFAs and hydrogen production (Maspolim et al., 2015), and its abundance here was found to be substantially increased from 0.003% in the control to 1.9% in F-PF3 fermenter. The abundance of Romboutsia, a genus that can adopt glucose as fermentation substrate to produce VFAs and hydrogen (Kim and Lee, 2015), was found to be slightly enhanced from 0.6% to 1.0% under F-PF3 condition. The genus Petrimonas and Tissierella, two typical hydrogen producers frequently detected in anaerobic fermenters (Jabari et al., 2012; Li et al., 2020b; Wu et al., 2019), were both enriched in F-PF3 fermenter with the abundances respectively increased by 6.8% and 3.1%, compared with the control one. The calculated data showed that the total proportion of the six VFAs and hydrogen producers in F-PF3 fermenter reached 17.2%, much higher than 2.6% of the control fermenter. The analysis of microbial abundance at phylum and genus levels demonstrated that the bacterial community in F-PF3 fermenter was more favorable to hydrogen production, thus enhanced the hydrogen production in F-PF3 fermenter (Fig. 1)."
14,Effect of freezing coupled with PF pretreatment on sludge dewatering performance,"3.5 Effect of freezing coupled with PF pretreatment on sludge dewatering performance Considering the highly water contained characteristic of sludge, dewatering is an essential procedure before sludge final disposal to sharply reduce the processing cost. However, sludge dewaterability was found to be severely deteriorated after fermentation (Liu et al., 2021). To reveal whether freezing coupled with PF pretreatment affected sludge dewatering performance, two indicators including water content (Wc) and settling velocity (SV) in control, F, PF, F-PF1, F-PF2, and F-PF3 fermenters after 252 h fermentation were measured (Fig. 8 ). Wc denotes sludge dewaterability which can intuitively reflect the dewatering extent of sludge. It was obviously decreased from 89.2% in the control to 84.4% and 87.6% in individual F and PF fermenters after fermentation, respectively. The reason may be that the water grabbed in sludge EPS and microbial cells was released during sludge disintegration by F or PF pretreatment. When pretreated by combined F and PF, sludge Wc was further reduced, with a minimum value of 81.0% was measured in F-PF3 fermenter (Fig. 8). SV is usually adopted to evaluate the settleability of sludge, as a lower value represents a better settling performance. In Fig. 8, SV in individual F pretreated fermenter is 32.9%, much lower than 91.9% of the control fermenter without any pretreatment, indicating that the ultimate sludge settleability was greatly promoted by F pretreatment. In contrast, the sludge settleability in PF fermenter was found to be deteriorated for the SV was detected to be 96.4%, even notably higher than that of the control one (91.9%). Previous studies have reported that the sludge particle size was obviously minished by PF pretreatment because of the destruction of sludge floc structure (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019), which could be a possible reason for the decreased settleability. It was also seen from Fig. 8 that the negative effect of PF pretreatment on sludge settleability was effectively eliminated when combined with F pretreatment, for the SV values were measured to be 33.8%, 37.5%, and 39.4% in F-PF1, F-PF2, and F-PF3 fermenters, respectively, very close to that by individual F pretreatment. Freezing method has been reported to be efficient in improving sludge settleability by increasing the particle size (Carrasco and Gao, 2019; Liu et al., 2020), which well explained the elimination of deteriorated settling property caused by PF pretreatment. These results illuminated that both the dewaterability and settleability of sludge were excellently promoted by F coupled with PF pretreatment."
15,Overall understanding and implications,"3.6 Overall understanding and implications The results in this study demonstrated that the fermentative hydrogen yield was efficiently promoted by F coupled with PF pretreatment, with the promotional degree significantly higher than that by individual F or PF pretreatment. Most of the organics in sludge are existed as EPS or captured in microbial cells, generally very difficult to be used by anaerobic microorganisms during fermentation (Peng et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Further investigation showed that F and PF co-pretreatment efficaciously disrupted the stabilized EPS structure, by which the TB-EPS was largely converted into LB-EPS or dissolved into sludge liquor. Beyond that, this study also found that a majority of microbial cells were damaged by combined F and PF pretreatment, resulting in the leakage of intracellular organics into liquid phase of sludge. Owing to these two effects, sludge disintegration was apparently enhanced by F coupled with PF pretreatment, providing more substrates for subsequent biochemical reactions. To evaluate the effect of F coupled with PF pretreatment on other biochemical processes, several model substrates degradation experiments were conducted. It was found that apart from that for acidogenesis process, the activities of microbes participated in all the hydrolysis, acetogenesis, homoacetogenesis, sulfate-reducing and methanogenesis processes were inhibited by F and PF co-pretreatment. It should be noted that the suppressive effects of F and PF co-pretreatment on microbes for hydrogen consumption were more serious than that for hydrogen production, which consequently facilitated the its accumulation. Further analysis demonstrated that the abundances of hydrolytic and hydrogen producing bacteria in combined F and PF pretreatment fermenter was greatly higher than that in the control fermenter, which further explained the promoted hydrogen production by the F coupled with PF pretreatment. In PF oxidization process, no toxic byproduct was generated, thus utilizing PF in sludge pretreatment to enhance fermentation or digestion performance has attracted lots of attentions (Li et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020). This study found that PF combined with freezing pretreatment exerted synergetic effect on fermentative hydrogen production, with a maximum yield of 12.5 mL/g VSS was detected when pretreated by combined freezing and PF at 0.15 g/g TSS, which was distinctly higher than that of 10.1, 9.28, and 10.55 mL/g VSS respectively obtained by heat + alkaline, ozone + ultrasound, and CaO2 pretreatments in the literatures (Wang et al., 2019b; Yang et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2010). It is also worth noting that freezing combined with PF at 0.1 g/g TSS achieved a higher hydrogen production than individual 0.15 g/g TSS PF pretreatment (10.69 versus 9.32 mL/g VSS) in this study, which means less PF is needed by combining with freezing pretreatment to realize the same or even higher hydrogen production. Considering the high price of PF, the processing cost could be largely reduced when assisted with freezing pretreatment, which can be readily achieved in natural environment of cold regions. Beyond that, the dewatering performance of fermented sludge was effectively improved by freezing coupled with PF pretreatment, which was reflected in the promoted dewatering extent and decreased dewatering difficulty. The results obtained in this study firstly clarified the feasibility of freezing and PF co-treatment method on sludge pretreatment for promoting the biohydrogen production, as well as the underlying mechanisms. These findings not only effectively supplemented the knowledge system of PF-based pretreatment method in lab-scale, but also provided a new insight for engineers in practical WAS treatment. It is worth noting that this study focuses on the co-treatment method of PF coupled with freezing under the single temperature of −12 °C for 24 h, while the effect of freezing temperature and time on sludge anaerobic fermentation performance was not investigated. Several previous literatures reported that temperature and time can significantly affect sludge disintegration degree during freezing pretreatment (Hu et al., 2011; She et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2018). However, whether these two factors have some impacts on sludge anaerobic fermentation system, especially when combined with PF pretreatment, is still not clear at present, and need to be investigated in future times."
16,Conclusions,"In this work, the effect of freezing and PF co-pretreatment on fermentative hydrogen production from sludge was revealed. The maximum hydrogen yield was found to be remarkably enhanced from 1.58 to 12.50 mL/g VSS after pretreated by freezing at −12 °C for 24 h coupled with 0.15 g/g TSS PF. Mechanism analyses indicated that freezing coupled with PF pretreatment effectively promoted sludge disintegration, while severely suppressed the hydrogen consuming processes including homoacetogenesis, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, and sulfate reducing. Microbial investigations demonstrated that the abundances of hydrolytic and hydrogen producing bacteria were largely increased in freezing coupled with PF pretreated fermenter (26.1%) compared with the control (5.1%). Moreover, both the dewaterability and settleability of sludge after fermentation were significantly enhanced by combined freezing and PF pretreatment, with the Wc and SV decreased from 89.2% and 91.9 to 81.0% and 39.4%, respectively. The co-pretreatment method of freezing coupled with PF could be suitable for applying in cold regions, especially for large-scale engineering practice, because the cost for freezing can be largely reduced."
