0,Introduction,"A self-healing hydrogel is a functional hydrogel with a three-dimensional network structure that has the ability to reform bonds when severed, and reconstruct itself (Taylor & in het Panhuis, 2016; Wei et al., 2015). Self-healing hydrogels have potential applications in tissue engineering (Saunders & Ma, 2019; Talebian et al., 2019), drug delivery (Chen, Cheng et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2017), sensing (Cai et al., 2017; Darabi et al., 2017), electronic skin, and wearable flexible devices (Lim et al., 2019; Zhang, Wan et al., 2019). Despite the rapid development of self-healing hydrogels, challenges such as poor biodegradability, low mechanical strength, and a degree of toxicity, are limiting further development (Talebian et al., 2019). Therefore, the development and preparation of a self-healing hydrogel that is environmentally friendly, bio-adaptable, and multifunctional has attracted extensive attention in the research field. The major problem associated with fabricating a multifunctional self-healing hydrogel is the selection of raw materials, which currently include synthetic polymers. Despite playing crucial role in the construction of self-healing hydrogels, these polymers are generally non-renewable, costly, and their poor biodegradability limits the overall performance of the obtained hydrogel. However, cellulose nanofiber (CNF), a biomass-based material, is renewable, non-toxic, biocompatible, inexpensive, readily available, and considered to be an important renewable resource for hydrogel preparation and sensing applications (Nguyen, Naficy, Chandrawati, & Dehghani, 2019; Golmohammadi, Morales-Narváez, Naghdi, & Merkoçi, 2017; Thomas et al., 2018). More importantly, the main chain of cellulose forms a layered structure that leads to strong interactions between other polymer matrices and neighboring CNFs. This arrangement provides favorable conditions for the fabrication of multifunctional hydrogels with improved mechanical strength. In addition, CNF is a good alternative for the preparation of self-healing hydrogels. The large number of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the CNFs enables them to form hydrogen, boric acid ester, acylhydrazone, and imide bonds as well as bonds with other polymers (Jia et al., 2013; Muthuswamy et al., 2013). These non-covalent bonds and dynamic covalent bonds can enable the preparation of a self-healing hydrogel with multiple functions and properties (Talebian et al., 2019). Among the polymers that can be compounded with CNF, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyacrylamide, poly(acrylic acid), and poly(ethylene glycol) are the most studied because they are bioinert, non-toxic, and have adjustable chemical and mechanical properties (Chen, Low, Loi, Merel, & Mohd Cairul Iqbal, 2019). For example, Zheng et al. (2019) designed a conductive self-healing hydrogel based on CNF, graphene, and PVA for use in strain sensors. The network of hydrogen bonds, entanglement between PVA and CNFs, and dynamic reversible bonds generated by borax crosslinking in this hydrogel greatly improved its elasticity, mechanical strength, and self-healing ability when compared to traditional PVA and CNF-based hydrogels. Second, the preparation of multifunctional self-healing hydrogels usually involves chemical graft modification of the polymer and a composite of nanoparticles or metal ions and requires complex synthetic processes. Therefore, certain aspects of hydrogel preparation process, such as the complex synthesis, long production time, toxicity, and poor biocompatibility require improvement. As reported in the literature, a self-healing hydrogel can readily be prepared by in-situ polymerization, which entails hydrothermal treatment under mild conditions in sealed containers, and is a facile and environmentally friendly method (Zhang et al., 2019). The hydrothermal process usually takes aqueous solution as reaction medium, and creates a high-pressure reaction environment by heating a closed reaction vessel, which can effectively promote the hydrogel formation. The shape and chemical structure can be controlled by adjusting the hydrothermal conditions. Govindaraj, Abathodharanan, Ravishankar, and Raghavachari (2019) reported a method to prepare a macroporous chitosan hydrogel, featuring water absorption and biocompatibility, using a hydrothermal reaction with chitosan, succinic acid, and urea as raw materials. The biocompatibility of this hydrogel with mouse fibroblasts showed that it is suitable for biomedical applications. The hydrothermal method has been considered to be an important route for preparing various hydrogels, especially graphene-based hydrogels (Chen, Li et al., 2018; Chen, Cheng et al., 2018). Recent study also focused on the preparation of carbon dot-based hydrogels through the hydrothermal method (Qi et al., 2019). However, hydrothermal preparation of multifunctional biomass-based hydrogels often requires long reaction time and complicated procedures, especially for hydrogels with multifunctionality such as self-healing, fluorescence, high strength and sensing capability (Chen et al., 2020). Thus, the fabrication of these hydrogels remains a challenge. This study aimed to verify the hypothesis that the hydrothermal method can be employed to fabricate cellulose-based hydrogels with characteristics of self-healing, fluorescence, high strength and versatile sensing capability. In this work, a fluorescent self-healing multifunctional NPC hydrogel was fabricated using a facile one-step in-situ hydrothermal method. The fluorescence, mechanical and self-healing properties of NPC hydrogel were investigated, and a NPC hydrogel-based capacitive sensor was applied in practical applications, including strain/stress sensing in air, human motion detection, and real-time synchronous pressure-glucose sensing in glucose solution. This study provides a foundation for the facile and rapid preparation of fluorescent self-healing hydrogels, and expands the field of application of these hydrogels to biological–mechanical sensing materials."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, MW = 1750 ± 50, >99 %) was purchased from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Sodium tetraborate (borax, ≥99.5 %) and glucose was purchased from Aladdin Ltd. CNF employed in this study was prepared with commercial bleached softwood kraft pulp supplied by Arauco woodpulp (Chile). Anhydrous ethylenediamine (EDA, <99 %) was purchased from Tianjin Zhiyuan Chemical Reagent Ltd. (China). NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, LiCl2, CuCl2, ZnCl2, FeCl3, HCl, and NaOH were purchased from Tianjin Zhiyuan Chemical Reagent Ltd. (China). All aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized water."
3,Preparation of CNF suspension,"2.2 Preparation of CNF suspension A 4 wt% suspension of CNF in water was extracted from paper pulp using a previously reported 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-oxidation method (Saito & Isogai, 2004; Su, Burger, Hsiao, & Chu, 2014). Briefly, 10 g of pulp and 500 mL of deionized water were mixed, heated and stirred at 38 °C. Then, 0.2 g TEMPO, 1 g NaBr and 80 g NaClO were added. A small amount of HCl was added dropwise to start the reaction. 0.5 mol/L NaOH solution was used to adjust and keep pH around 10, and the reaction was lasted for 3 h. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was centrifuged and washed with deionized water, and this process was repeated until the supernatant was neutral. Finally, the treated cellulose was then ultrasonically processed to obtain the CNF suspension. The mean diameter of CNF was 35 nm, which was measured based on the TEM images of CNF (Fig. S1, Supplementary Material). The lignin content of dried CNF determined by the previous method (Cheng, Sun, Wang, Zhao, & Hu, 2019; Cheng, Zhao, & Hu, 2018) was 2.9 %, and the zeta potential of CNF was −45.72 mV."
4,Preparation of NPC hydrogel,"2.3 Preparation of NPC hydrogel PVA particles were added to deionized water to prepare a solution (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%) under stirring at 90 °C for 2 h. Meanwhile, a sodium borate solution (1 wt%) was prepared by dissolving the sodium borate in deionized water under stirring at room temperature (25 °C) for 10 min. After the PVA solution had cooled to room temperature, a CNF suspension (1 g, 4 wt%) and EDA solution (75 μL) were added to a PVA solution (2 g) to form a uniform solution under stirring at room temperature. Then, the borax solution was mixed with the PVA/CNF/EDA solution by gentle stirring and ultrasonic treatment to prevent the introduction of bubbles. Finally, the solution was sealed in a 10 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, which was heated at 120 °C for 2 h and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The product was recovered in the form of a yellow hydrogel. The preparation process was optimized by studying the effects of PVA content, CNF, and EDA on the mechanical, fluorescence and self-healing properties of hydrogels. The different raw material ratios of hydrogel preparation are shown in Table 1 . After optimization and comprehensive consideration of fluorescence, self-healing and mechanical properties of different hydrogels, NPC-2 was used for subsequent ion detection and sensing experiments."
5,Preparation of CNF/EDA carbon dots,"2.4 Preparation of CNF/EDA carbon dots Carbon dots were prepared via a one-step hydrothermal process. CNF suspension (1 g, 4 wt%) and EDA solution (75 μL) was mixed under stirring at room temperature. Then, the mixture was sealed in a 10 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, heated at 120 °C for 2 h and then allowed to cool to room temperature. Afterwards, the solution of CNF/EDA carbon dots was collected after centrifugation at 8000 rpm to remove waste and debris to yield a yellow solution (Fig. S2, Supplementary Material)."
6,Self-healing properties,"2.5 Self-healing properties The self-healing properties of the hydrogels were assessed at ambient temperature. Two hydrogel specimens were colored with either methylene blue or rhodamine red dye. The treated hydrogels were cut into halves, after which one red half and one blue half were brought into contact and allowed to self-heal for 2 h without disturbance. The abilities of the hydrogels to undergo self-healing in the presence of water was also examined using a similar procedure. The dissected hydrogel pieces were first soaked in water for 30 min, after which the self-healing times were measured after removing them from the water and bringing them into contact."
7,Ion detection,"2.6 Ion detection In a typical experiment, hydrogels were placed in solution of different ions (10 mM) and the photoluminescence spectra were recorded after allowing them to react for 30 min at room temperature. The hydrogels were subsequently added to Cu2+ solution with a concentration of 0.1, 1, or 10 mM. The photoluminescence spectra were recorded after reaction for 30 min at room temperature."
8,Sensing performance,"2.7 Sensing performance Capacitance was measured using a Victor 4090A inductance, capacitance, and resistance meter (Xi'an, China) at a frequency of 1 kHz with a 1 V AC signal under various device stimuli. For the sensing test, two electrical wires on the instrument were linked to two copper sheets, respectively. And the sensor was assembled by placing the copper sheets at both end of the hydrogel. The sensor was gently wrapped with PVA film to fix the copper sheets and prevent them from falling off."
9,Characterizations,"2.8 Characterizations FTIR spectra of PVA/borax, PVA/borax/EDA, and NPC composite hydrogels were acquired using a Nicolet 6700 infrared spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Corp, USA) in the 500–4000 cm−1 wavenumber range. The hydrogel was first frozen in a cold trap at −55 °C, and then freeze-dried under vacuum at −64 °C for 24 h. The morphology of the freeze-dried hydrogel sample was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; S-3400 N, Hitachi, Japan) at 5 kV for secondary electron imaging after being coated with gold. The hydrogel was also characterized using an SU8220 field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The secondary electron images of the dried samples were collected with an acceleration voltage ranging from 5 kV to 15 kV. The morphology of carbon dots and hydrogels was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM; FEI, USA) operating at 300 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen-containing functional groups present on the surfaces of the nanomaterials using an ESCALAB 250XI + spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Fluorescence emission and absorption spectra were acquired using a CARY ECLIPSE fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent, USA). The emission and excitation slits were 5 nm wide. The tensile and compression tests of hydrogel were performed with a CMT5504 universal mechanical testing machine (Shenzhen Suns Testing Technology Co., Ltd, Shenzhen, China) at 25 °C and 65 % RH. The dimensions of the specimens for the tensile and compression tests were 50mm*30mm*10 mm (length*width*height) and 15mm*10 mm (diameter*height), respectively. A series of loading speeds of 5, 10, 20, and 50 mm min−1 were adopted to investigate the effect of loading speed on the mechanical properties of NPC hydrogel."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Hydrogel formation,"3.1 Hydrogel formation Fig. 1 a presents the fabrication process of NPC hydrogel. The multifunctional hydrogel was fabricated using a facile and simple one-step in-situ hydrothermal method. The in-situ carbonization of the carbon dot precursors and the formation of the hydrogel system were simultaneously achieved. More specifically, the CNF was partially hydrolyzed into polysaccharides and monosaccharides during the hydrothermal reaction. The produced polysaccharides can also undergo isomerization, dehydration, and fragmentation reactions that lead to the formation of various soluble products (Li et al., 2017). Then, subsequent polymerization or condensation reactions caused by intermolecular dehydration or reactions between these intermediates and EDA form nitrogen-doped carbon dots. At the same time, borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O) was rapidly and completely dissolved in the aqueous solution to produce equal quantities of trigonal planar B(OH)3 and tetrahedral B(OH)4 −, in which the concentration of tetrahedral B(OH)4 − was nearly twice the initial borax concentration. More importantly, the B(OH)4- ion is tetrahedral in shape with a boron atom at its center and four hydroxyl groups at each corner, and can form various complexes with the cis-diol sites of the PVA chains and CNF (Ding et al., 2018), as shown in Fig. 1a. In this way, borax acts as a cross-linker between PVA and CNF, and results in dynamic boric acid ester, a covalent bond that can be broken and formed under mild conditions (Ding et al., 2018), between these components. Further, CNF and PVA molecules can become entangled with each other via hydrogen bonding. Therefore, the hydrogen bonding system with its multi-complexation, entanglement of polymer chains, and the presence of carbon dots establishes a solid network structure for the hydrogel (Zheng et al., 2019). Boric acid ester bonds is a kind of dynamic and reversible covalent chemical bond, which can realize the breakage and formation of the bond under mild conditions. And hydrogen bonds possess weak interaction force, and the breakage and formation of bonds are also reversible. Consequently, the existence of boric acid ester bonds and hydrogen bonds provided theoretical feasibility for the self-healing of NPC hydrogels. As shown in Fig. 1b–e, a yellow NPC hydrogel with a smooth surface was successfully synthesized, which demonstrates promising fluorescence behavior (Fig. 1c), high mechanical strength (Fig. 1d) and ion-detection capabilities (Fig. 1e). The optimization of hydrogel preparation process indicated the significant influence of PVA content, CNF, and EDA on the mechanical, fluorescence and self-healing properties of hydrogels (Fig. S3, Supplementary Material). Especially, the introduction of carbon dots can endow the hydrogels with fluorescence properties, and promote their multifunctionality and sensing performance. The presence of carbon dots can also promote the conductivity of the hydrogel. The conductivity of NPC hydrogel was 9.2 × 10-5 s m-1, which was higher than that of hydrogel prepared without ethylenediamine (2.3 × 10-5 s m-1)."
12,Hydrogel morphology and mechanical properties,"3.2 Hydrogel morphology and mechanical properties The hierarchical 3D network interconnected porous microstructure of the NPC hydrogel was observed using SEM (Fig. 2 a). FE-SEM images (Fig. 2b) confirmed the entanglement between PVA and CNFs, which effectively promotes the development of the hierarchical porous network. More importantly, this type of configuration promotes the transport and diffusion of molecules, ions, and electrons, which theoretically contributes to the conductivity of the composite hydrogel. In addition, the degree of crosslinking can be enhanced by the addition of CNFs and the formation of boric acid ester bonds and hydrogen bonding between PVA, CNF, and borax. The hierarchical structure of the pore network indicates strong interactions between the compounds and results in the desirable hydrophilicity and mechanical properties of the hydrogel (Han, Wang et al., 2019). An aqueous solution of CNF/EDA carbon dots and the hydrogel was analyzed by TEM to observe the morphology of the carbon dots and their distribution in the hydrogel (Fig. 2c-d). The CNF/EDA carbon dots were spherical and mono-dispersed in the aqueous solution and had a narrow size distribution in the 2.5−4.5 nm range. High resolution TEM images of the carbon dots (inset of Fig. 2b) revealed well-resolved lattice planes, confirming the formation of sp2 graphitic carbon in the carbon dots. The d spacing calculated for the CNF/EDA dots was 0.24 nm, which corresponds to the (100) plane of graphitic carbon (Jing, Li et al., 2019; Khaleghi et al., 2018). TEM images of the hydrogel revealed that carbon dots with diameters of 2–4 nm were well dispersed throughout the hydrogel (Fig. 2d). Gaussian fitting (inset of Fig. 2d) revealed that the average size of the carbon dots in the hydrogels was approximately 3 nm, which was marginally smaller than that of the pure carbon dots. The size difference was mainly attributed to the addition of PVA and borax, which can be involved in the reaction of CNF and EDA to form carbon dots and influence the size. Fig. 2e summarized the tensile and compression strengths of hydrogels prepared with different raw material ratios. The addition of EDA, the increase of PVA content and the addition of CNF played critical roles in improving the mechanical strength of hydrogels. The optical condition resulted in a high tensile strength of 2.98 MPa and a promising compression strength of 1.69 MPa. The stress-strain curves of tensile testing indicated that the instantaneous stress of hydrogels increased gradually and the strain decreased as the stretching velocity increased (Fig. 2f and Fig. S3, Supplementary Material). Additionally, the self-healed hydrogel gave comparable tensile strength and strain with the original hydrogel (Fig. 2f), indicating the promising self-healing performance of the hydrogel. Mechanical properties and the corresponding solid content of reported PVA-containing self-healing hydrogels (Chen, Hao et al., 2018; Gong et al., 2016; Han, Ding et al., 2019; Jing, Zhang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018; Wang, Lv, Feng, Li, & Zhang, 2019) were compared with the developed NPC hydrogel (Fig. 2g). The results indicated that the new material showed promising mechanical properties at a comparable solid content. The NPC hydrogel also withstood various forms of deformation, including ultimate stretching (with an ultimate elongation of up to 1089 %) and knotting (Fig. 2f, Inset), which highlighted its excellent mechanical properties and flexibility."
13,Chemical structure of the NPC composite hydrogel,"3.3 Chemical structure of the NPC composite hydrogel Fig. 2h shows the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of PVA/borax, PVA/borax/EDA, and the NPC hydrogel. The spectrum of the NPC hydrogel had characteristic peaks at 3375, 2927, 1645, and 1091 cm−1 attributed to OH stretching, CH asymmetric stretching, CO carbonyl stretching, and CO stretching, respectively (Huang, Hou, Li, Wang, & Zhang, 2017; Jing, Li et al., 2019; Khaleghi et al., 2018). Peaks at 1421 and 1321 cm-1 were attributed to the BOB bond; the presence of these peaks confirmed crosslinking between PVA, CNF, and borax (Yue, Gu, Han, Wu, & Jiang, 2021). In addition, the characteristic bands for the BH4 and BO bending vibration of B(OH)4- at 917 and 836 cm-1 provided further evidence for the crosslinking between borax, PVA, and CNF, and the presence of a small amount of unreacted B(OH)4- in the hydrogel (Dixit, Bag, Sharma, & Eswara Prasad, 2019; Huang et al., 2017). The FTIR spectrum of PVA/borax/EDA is comparable to that of the NPC hydrogel, whereas the overlapping OH and NH peaks at 3400–3200 cm−1 in the spectrum of the PVA/borax/EDA hydrogel shifted to 3350–3200 cm-1 in the spectrum of the NPC hydrogel, which was assigned to OH stretching. The disappearance of the NH stretching signal was attributed to the formation of carbon dots during the reaction between CNF and EDA when CNF was added to the PVA/borax/EDA system. Compared with the PVA/borax hydrogel, the absorption peak of the NPC hydrogel (OH stretching vibration) at ∼3375 cm-1 significantly increased in intensity, indicating strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds between CNF, PVA, and borax molecules. The FTIR results confirm the enhancement of interactions in the hydrogel due to the addition of CNF, which may also contribute to the mechanical properties of the hydrogel. The effect of hydrogel formation on the chemical structure of the carbon dots was also analyzed by determining the chemical structure and elemental composition of the CNF/EDA carbon dots and the NPC hydrogel using XPS. As shown in Fig. 2i–l and Table S1 (Supplementary Material), the XPS spectra of the carbon dots and hydrogels were comparable considering the C1s, N1s, and O1s peaks, indicating that hydrogel formation had a limited influence on the carbon dots. The N1s peaks of the CNF/EDA carbon dots at 398.3 and 399.2 eV were assigned to the secondary/tertiary nitrogen atom of the polymer matrix and CN bonds, respectively. Specifically, the N1s peak at 399.2 eV completely disappeared upon formation of the hydrogel (Fig. S4, Supplementary Material), and the high-resolution N1s peak of the hydrogel revealed a new species with a peak at 400.6 eV attributed to the NH2 group (Bhattacharya et al., 2019). The results showed that the synchronized carbon-dot/hydrogel synthesis process promotes the formation of functional groups on the surfaces of the carbon dots. Compared to the pure carbon dots, the slight shift of all peaks in the hydrogel may be caused by interactions between the carbon dots and the hydrogel. A peak at 496.5 eV attributed to Na was also observed, and may originate from the sodium CNF-carboxylate produced by TEMPO-oxidation and free Na+ produced by the hydrolysis of borax."
14,"Self-healing, fluorescence and ion detection of hydrogel","3.4 Self-healing, fluorescence and ion detection of hydrogel Fig. 3 a presents the self-healing properties of the NPC hydrogel. A hydrogel sample that was cut into two pieces can begin to self-heal within 10 min, achieve preliminary self-healing within 60 min, and completely self-heal after 120 min without any stimulation. And no fracturing behavior was observed in the self-healed area, even when the sample was stretched under a strain of more than 1000 %. The self-healing performance of the hydrogel was greatly enhanced by soaking the two dissected hydrogel halves in water, with the time required for self-healing shortened to 30 min (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, after soaking the hydrogel in water for 120 min, the time required by the hydrogel to self-heal was further shortened to 5 min (Fig. S5, Supplementary Material). Dynamic rheology provides useful information about the self-healing ability of hydrogels, so a series of step strain measurements were performed to evaluate the self-healing properties of the developed NPC hydrogel (Fig. 3c). At 1% strain, the storage modulus (G’) was much higher than the loss modulus (G”), indicating the formation of the hydrogel. However, G’ and G” were reversed at 300 % strain, when the hydrogel transformed into a sol-gel state and the network within the hydrogel was broken. Upon restoration of a small amount of strain, G’ and G” returned to their original states. Moreover, these “destruction” and “recovery” processes were highly repeatable, highlighting the outstanding self-healing properties of the hydrogel. These properties are mainly attributable to the breakage and recovery of the dynamic boric acid ester bonds within the hydrogel (Guo et al., 2014; Shao et al., 2019). The in-situ formation of carbon dots resulted in a hydrogel with promising fluorescence properties. The hydrogel was yellow in daylight, whereas a green-blue color was observed upon exposure to 365 nm radiation under a UV lamp (inset of Fig. 3e). The optical absorption properties of the hydrogel were investigated by recording its ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) absorbance spectrum (Fig. 3d). The presence of an absorbance band at 290 nm corresponding to the π–π* transition of the aromatic CC group of the localized sp2 clusters in the core indicated that the hydrogel strongly absorbs UV light. The broad absorption peak in the 300–350 nm range was attributed to the n–π* transition of CO bonds and may be related to the generation of excited defect surface states produced by the nitrogen heteroatoms in the carbon dots, which can result in strong luminescence (Bhattacharya et al., 2019; Das et al., 2018; Fu & Cui, 2016). Based on this analysis, the fluorescence properties of the hydrogel were further studied by recording its fluorescence spectrum (Fig. 3e). The hydrogel exhibited double-emission fluorescence characteristics (i.e., there were two emission peaks in the fluorescence spectrum), which were excitation-dependent in the 240–460 nm wavelength range. The fluorescence peaks in the fluorescence spectrum were red-shifted and varied in intensity as the excitation wavelength increased. The maximum fluorescence-emission intensity was achieved at 480 nm and 760 nm when excited at 380 nm (Fig. 3f). This excitation-dependent fluorescence behavior is due to multiple functional groups containing C, N, and O atoms on the surfaces of the carbon dots (Fu & Cui, 2016), which form various surface states with different energy levels and emissive traps. Fig. 3g and Fig. S6 (Supplementary Material) show the responsiveness of the hydrogel to various metal ions, including K+, Na+, Mg2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Li2+, and Cu2+. The fluorescence spectra of the hydrogel treated with different metal ions under the same conditions was recorded. Compared with other ions, Cu2+ ions were seen to quench the fluorescence of the hydrogel. On this basis, to further evaluate the response of the hydrogel to Cu2+, the fluorescence spectra of a hydrogel treated with an aqueous solution of Cu2+ at concentrations ranging from 0.1–10 mM was examined at an excitation wavelength of 254 nm (Fig. 3h). The fluorescence intensity of the hydrogel at 480 nm was highly sensitive to the presence of Cu2+ ions, and showed significant correlation with Cu2+ concentration, resulting an extremely high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.997 (Fig. 3i). The high sensitivity of the hydrogel toward Cu2+ was mainly due to the strong coordination ability of Cu2+ ions with nitrogen atoms and the chelation of Cu2+ with N and O atoms in the carbon dots. These interactions brought the carbon dots into close proximity with each other, leading to a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity (Fu & Cui, 2016; Liu et al., 2012)."
15,Sensing performance of the NPC hydrogel-based sensor,"3.5 Sensing performance of the NPC hydrogel-based sensor The excellent characteristics of the NPC hydrogel, including its promising mechanical properties, self-healing performance, and responsiveness toward glucose, make it an ideal material for strain, pressure, and glucose sensors. Herein, capacitive sensors (Fig. 4 a) with two NPC hydrogels as electrodes and one layer of dielectric material sandwiched between them were assembled to investigate their potential application in strain and pressure sensing, human motion detection, and glucose sensing. As shown in Fig. 4b, the sensor provided excellent feedback in response to human motion. When the sensor was attached to a finger, the capacitance increased with increasing bending angle, and returned to its original value as the finger straightened again. This process was repeatable, which indicated reliable long-term sensing performance of the NPC hydrogel in response to dynamic pressure and strain. In addition, the NPC-based sensor exhibited quantifiable responsiveness as changing the weight from 10 g to 100 g (Fig. 4c). Hydrogel thickness in the sensor played an important role in the sensing responsiveness, and larger thickness led to a larger capacitance change of the sensor (Fig. 4d). Regardless of the thickness, the sensor can show excellent responsiveness to the application and removal of pressure when a 100 g weight was iteratively placed on it and removed from it. The realization of these sensors shows the viability of the developed hydrogel in the field of human motion monitoring and pressure sensing. The sensing performance of the NPC-based sensor before and after self-healing was compared in Fig. 4e. It is found that the self-healing process showed limited influence on its sensing performance, and the results indicated that the self-healing characteristics endowed the NPC-based sensor with excellent sensing stability. The ability to monitor and control glucose concentration in real-time is important for making optimal therapeutic decisions for patient care (Li, Xiang, Men, & Zhang, 2019). The assembled sensor with a hydrogel thickness of 8 mm was put into glucose solution with different concentrations, and the change of the capacitance signal can be observed immediately. Thus, real-time glucose sensing was achieved with the NPC-based sensor (Fig. 4f), where the change in capacitance was related to the concentration of the glucose solution. This was attributed to the enhanced reaction between glucose and borax with increasing glucose concentration (Li et al., 2019). This reaction results in the disruption of the network structure formed by PVA, CNF, and borax (Yang et al., 2020), and promotes the diffusion of ions in the hydrogel into the glucose solution, thereby decreasing the conductivity and increasing the capacitance of the hydrogel (Zheng et al., 2020). The sensing performance of NPC-based sensor toward different stimuli was quantitatively analyzed by investigating the correlationship between different stimuli and capacitance change (Fig. S7, Supplementary Material). The linear regression analyses resulted in high coefficient of determination, indicating significant correlation between the capacitance change of NPC-based sensor and finger bending angle, pressure, and glucose concentration, respectively. These results confirmed the excellent quantifiable sensing behavior of the NPC-based capacitor sensor toward different stimuli, including strain, pressure and glucose solution. More importantly, the NPC-based sensor is responsive to pressure changes in the glucose solution, and showed a pressure responsiveness dependent on glucose concentration (Fig. 4g–h); this indicates that the sensor can simultaneously detect glucose concentration and pressure, which can be applied, for example, in the real-time synchronous monitoring of both blood glucose concentration and blood pressure. The multiple linear regression analysis indicated the capacitance change of the sensor exhibited significant linear correlation with pressure and glucose concentration, resulting in a fitting surface (y = 0.170 + 0.0481*x 1+0.0302x 2) with coefficient of determination of 0.875 (Fig. 4i). In the equation of the surface, y stands for the capacitance change of the sensor, x 1 is the concentration of glucose solution, and x 2 is the mass of weight. The analysis of variance also confirmed the significant linear correlation between them through F-test (Table S2, Supplementary Material), thereby highlighting the superior quantifiable synchronous pressure/glucose sensing performance of the NPC-based sensor. Based on the above analyses, the NPC hydrogel designed here demonstrates great potential for applications in biological–mechanical sensing."
16,Conclusions,"In summary, a new in-situ hydrothermal methodology to fabricate multifunctional NPC hydrogels featuring self-healing, fluorescence behavior and high tensile strength has been presented. The strategy allows CNF, PVA, ethylenediamine and borax to be synchronously assembled into a complex network in a facile and simple step, providing new insight in the design and synthesis of biomass-based multifunctional hydrogels. A capacitive sensor assembled with the NPC hydrogel enabled strain/stress, human motion, glucose concentration, and real-time synchronous linear pressure/glucose sensing, thereby highlighting its potential for practical wearable, biological–mechanical sensing applications. A construction platform of multifunctional hydrogels was proposed in this paper by introducing a multifunctionality design concept, presenting a facile one-step synthesis strategy, and developing practical applications."
