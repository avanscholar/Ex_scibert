0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, has been thought of as an ideal energy carrier to solve the rapid growth of world-wide energy and environmental crisis. Particularly, photocatalytic H2 generation from water splitting using semiconductor photocatalysts has achieved significant interest and received unprecedented attention as the primary method [1–3]. In the most recent studies, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) grabs considerable attention as an attractive competitor for photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water reduction due to its proper band gap, sustainability, easy functionality, superior catalytic activity and suitable band gap. Nevertheless, the efficiency of pristine g-C3N4 toward hydrogen production is thwarted by its rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Previous studies have confirmed that modifying g-C3N4 with other transition metal sulfides or phosphides is an effective strategy to facilitate the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Among these cocatalysts, transition metal selenides have been widely used as a feasible modified co-catalyst to improve the HER performance due to their superior catalytic activity, high thermal and chemical stability. Compared to other molybdenum-based cocatalysts, layered structure of MoSe2 exhibits more metallic characteristics with facilitated charge transfer, thus markedly possesses excellent electrical conductivity, beneficial to the electronic transmission [4]. Several groups have proved that two-dimensional (2D) MoSe2 nanoflowers exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity for HER [5–8]. Thus, MoSe2 has been supposed to be an attractive competitor to act as a cocatalyst hybridized with semiconductor photocatalysts for improving H2 evolution due to its intriguing merits. Although a few recent work reported the MoSe2 act as cocatalysts to boost photocatalytic H2 evolution, insufficient interfacial contact between semiconductors and MoSe2 lead to poor migration and separation of electron-hole pairs [9], thus, photocatalytic H2 evolution of MoSe2 hybridized photocatalysts in the existing reports are far unsatisfactory. Currently, plasmon-mediated photocatalysis is considered as a promising approach for achieving enhanced photoexcitation and improved charge separation in heterojunction photocatalyst systems. Electron interact and transfer between the metal and semiconductor, denoted as Mott-Schottky and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect [10,11], which is beneficial for enhancing hydrogen production. Motivated by the aforementioned considerations, herein, flower-like MoSe2/g-C3N4 nanosheets coupled with Pt nanoparticles were presented, in which MoSe2 acted as cocatalysts toward hydrogen production reaction over 2D C3N4 nanosheets, perfect electronic conductor of Pt nanoparticles could accelerate electron transport from the metal-semiconductor interface and the semiconductor surface to the activity site, thus facilitating the electron-hole separation and leading to the high efficient solar H2 production. At last, a possible enhancement of photocatalytic HER by Pt–MoSe2/g-C3N4 is also deduced according to the experimental results."
1,Experiment,
2,Preparation methods,"2.1 Preparation methods 2.1.1 Preparation of polymeric carbon nitride 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets were synthesized through thermal polymerization approach, typically, 45 g urea was placed into covered ceramic crucible, aferwards, treated at 550 °C for 4 h at a heating rate of 2.5 °C min−1, then the temperature was further maintained at 520 °C for 2 h to obtain the final production. 2.1.2 Preparation of MoSe2 nanoflowers 0.47 g Se and 0.48 g Na2MoO4 were immersed into 15 mL of ethyl alcohol and 15 mL deionized water with ultrasonic stirring for 0.5 h. After that, 0.076 g NaBH4 was supplemented into the mixture solution. After vigorous magnetic stirring, the color of the solution turned reddish brown form dark grey, afterwards, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, and heated at 200 °C for 20 h. After being cooled down to room temperature, the black precipitates were collected via suffering centrifugation, sample was thoroughly washed with water for sometimes and drying in vacuum overnight at 60 °C. 2.1.3 Synthesis of MoSe2/g-C3N4 hybrid nanocomposites A simple solution-phase method was employed to incorporate 3D flower-like MoSe2 into g-C3N4. Briefly, 120 mg of g-C3N4 and a given amount (1, 3, 5, or 8 wt%) of MoSe2 were well-dispersed in 50 mL of DMF/hexane/ethanol solution, followed ultrasonication for 1 h to obtain uniform dispersion of MoSe2/g-C3N4. Subsequently, the suspension was centrifuged and then dispersed into 30 mL of ethanol using sonication for additional 1 h. The resulting products were separated by centrifugation, washed with DI water and absolute ethanol in sequence, and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 24 h. The obtained samples were abbreviated as 1 MC, 3 MC, 5 MC and 8 MC, respectively. 2.1.4 Synthesis of Pt–MoSe2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites Pt–MoSe2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were synthesized by a chemical reduction route. Typically, 9.95 mg of as-synthesized 3 MC nanocomposites was added in 10 mL of ethanol. Certain amount of H2PtCl6•6H2O (38.6 mmol/L, 6.67 μL) into the suspension under stirring. Then, NaBH4 (0.1 M, 0.27 mL) was added dropwise to the above mentioned suspension with vigorously stirring for 4 h, then the product Pt–MoSe2/g-C3N4 (0.5% of the weight ratio of Pt to MoSe2/g-C3N4) was obtained after washing with deionized water and drying under 80 °C vacuum conditions. The resulting sample was abbreviated as 0.5P3MC (see Scheme 1 )."
3,Materials characterization,"2.2 Materials characterization XRD measurements were performed on a Panalytical XRD (Cu Ka source) at a scan rate of 5min−1. SEM images were conducted with FESEM 7600F scanning electron microscope with 5 kV acceleration voltage. TEM, scanning TEM (STEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) examinations were obtained by a JEOL 2100F Transmission electron microscope. UV–vis absorption spectra was obtained by UV–vis DRS (PerkinElmer, USA). FTIR spectra were performed by PerkinElmer GX 2000 Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a Shimadzu Kratos Axis Supra spectrometer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of photocatalysts were detected with a Jobin Yvon HR800 micro-Raman spectrometer using a 325 nm line from a He–Cd laser."
4,Photocatalytic H2 evolution,"2.3 Photocatalytic H2 evolution In a typical photocatalytic H2 evolution experiment, 60 mg of the prepared photocatalyst was added into 10 mL of TEOA aqueous solution (10% v/v, pH = 11). The suspension was degassed by N2 to completely remove air prior to light irradiation. The light input was provided by a 300-W Xenon lamp (Max-302, Asahi Spectra Co. Ltd.), and the solution was continuously stirred by a magnetic stirrer to keep the photocatalyst particles in suspension during the photocatalytic reaction. The hydrogen gas was sampled and periodically measured by Aglient 7890A gas chromatograph (TCD, 13 X columns, Ar carrier)."
5,Results and discussion,"XRD patterns of the as-prepared composites are displayed in Fig. 1 , the conspicuous diffraction peaks of pristine MoSe2 are perfectly consistent with the standard MoSe2 (JCPDS No. 29–0914) [12]. The diffraction peaks of g-C3N4 exhibit two characteristic diffraction peaks at 13.0° and 27.6°, which are well corresponded to in-planar repeating unites of tri-s-triazine units and the typical interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic structure, respectively, verifying the formation of g-C3N4 [13]. Both the evident peaks of MoSe2 and g-C3N4 are found in the XRD patterns of hybrid samples, no other impurity phases are detected, confirming the successful formation of MoSe2 and g-C3N4. The signature peaks of Pt are not observed in 0.5P3MC owing to the its limited amount and very small size incorporated into nanocomposites. The SEM image (Fig. 2 a) reveals that the obtained MoSe2 possesses flower-like assembled with numerous two-dimensional nanoplates, where the distribution of the size is in the range of 280–350 nm. To further investigate the microstructure and the morphology of MoSe2/g-C3N4 heterojunction coupled with Pt nanoparticles, the representative 0.5P3MC hybrid sample is examined using TEM (Fig. 2b–d). Spherical balls composed of multiple ultrathin nanosheets of MoSe2 are further confirmed. In addition, it could be clearly observed the MoSe2 flower-like microstructures is successfully anchored on g-C3N4 nanosheets, the close interfacial contact between MoSe2 and g-C3N4 is formed, and Pt nanoparticles with a few nanometres in size are in close contact with MoSe2/g-C3N4 composites. The HRTEM image of Fig. 2e displays the detailed structure of the nanocomposites, the lattice fringes of 0.65 nm could be indexed as the (002) lattice plane of MoSe2. The scanning TEM (STEM) image and the corresponding mapping profiles of 0.5P3MC are displayed in Fig. 2f-l, the homogeneous distribution of elements C, N, Mo, Se and Pt further reveals that MoSe2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites decorated with Pt nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized. Fig. 3 depicted the UV/Vis DRS spectra of g-C3N4, 0.5P3MC and MoSe2/g-C3N4 with different MoSe2 contents. The light absorption edge of bare g-C3N4 appears at about 455 nm, which means the band gap of bare g-C3N4 is 2.72 eV. After incorporating layered MoSe2, all of the MoSe2/g-C3N4 samples have marked absorption in the range of visible light, it can be seen that the absorption tail is greatly improved with increasing of MoSe2 content and similar absorption edge from one another in the visible region. Interestingly, when decorating MoSe2/g-C3N4 with Pt, 0.5P3MC shows smaller absorption edge and slightly enhanced light harvesting compared to 3MCN. With increasing MoSe2 load (and adding Pt), the color of hybrid powder changes from pale yellow to dark grey could further testifies this result (insets in Fig. 3). The enhanced light absorption of Pt–MoSe2/g-C3N4 might be able to excite more photoelectrons and holes to activate the catalyst towards H2 evolution. FTIR spectra showed in Fig. 4 are used to perform the chemical bonding of resultant samples. The prepared samples present the similar characteristic features to the bare g-C3N4, regardless of the introduction of MoSe2 and Pt, indicating that the loading of component does not destroy fundamental structure of g-C3N4. A series of characterized absorption bands from 1200 to 1625 cm−1 region are possibly corresponded to the C–N heterocycles [14], whereas the typical peak of 808 cm−1 is belonged to the out-of-plane bending characteristic of s-triazine ring units in CN heterocycles [15]. The broad absorption observed between 3020 and 3300 cm−1 originates from amines (e.g., –NH or –NH2) and –OH stretching mode [16–19]. These FT-IR spectra provided the useful information that hybridizing with flower-like MoSe2 and Pt nanoparticles do not change the chemical structure of 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets. The compositions and oxidation state of elements for Pt–MoSe2/g-C3N4 are characterized by XPS analysis. Two peaks exist in the C 1s spectrum can be assigned to sp2-hybridized carbon in the s-triazine ring (288.4 eV) and sp2 C–C bond (284.8 eV), respectively (Fig. 5 a) [20]. The typical peaks of N 1s with four characteristic peaks at 398.8, 399.9, 401.3 and 404.5 eV are corresponded to the quinoid imine (=N-), N–C3, benzenoid amine (–NH–) and π excitation of graphitic carbon, respectively (Fig. 5b). The above analysis reveals the presence of the characteristic nature of 2D g-C3N4 in sample 0.5P3MC. The doublet peaks of Mo 3d with binding energy of 228.7 eV (Mo 3d5/2) and 231.8 eV (Mo 3d3/2) indicate the existence of Mo4+ in the Mo–Se chemical bond (Fig. 5c) [21]. Further, the metallic Pt spectrum fitted into two peaks at approximately 71.0 and 74.3 eV could be ascribe to Pt 4f5/2 and P 4f7/2 of zero oxidation state (Fig. 5d) [22]. These above observations mutually support that Pt–MoSe2/g-C3N4 hybrid system is successfully prepared. The photocatalytic H2 generation activities over all samples are performed using TEOA as sacrificial agents under a 300-W Xenon lamp irradiation. As demonstrated in Fig. 6 a, pristine g-C3N4 shows a negligible amount of H2, pure MoSe2 presents a higher H2 evolution rates as compared to that of g-C3N4, which validates that the MoSe2 possibly become an idea cocatalyst hybridized with semiconductor photocatalysts for improving hydrogen evolution. As expected, the H2 evolution rate is greatly improved after coupling of MoSe2 to g-C3N4 nanosheets, the rate of H2 evolution of sample 1MCN is 40.5 μmol g−1. Particularly, the maximum activity of H2 evolution reached to 256.24 μmol g−1 over 3MCN, which is 6 times higher than that of bare MoSe2. Obviously, 3MCN with MoSe2 content of 3 wt% displays the optimized catalytic performance among all MoSe2/g-C3N4 photocatalysts, this optimal loading ratio demonstrates a higher photogenerated charge transfer may be primarily ascribed to the uniform distribution of MoSe2, as well as more effective active sites between MoSe2 and g-C3N4 heterojunction. When the mass ratio increases to 5% and 8%, the catalytic performance is unexpectedly reduced. Excessive amount of MoSe2 may lead to the shielding effect for the light that block the effective light absorption and hence decreasing the photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the hydrogen production of 3MCN could be further improved in the case of introducing 0.5 wt% Pt nanoparticles (0.5P3MCN), the result is presented in Fig. 6b, after 3 h irradiation, photocatalytic H2 generation could reach to 11,233 μmol g−1, which is 256.24 times larger than that of sample 3MCN absent Pt nanoparticles. To confirm MoSe2 could act as a cocatalyst hybridized with semiconductor photocatalysts for improved hydrogen evolution activity, the photocatalytic H2 generation of sample 0.5PCN without MoSe2 is also conducted. Apparently, though it exhibited increment of 27 times larger than that of the 3MCN, substantially lower H2 evolution in comparison with that of 0.5P3MCN photocatalyst with assistant of MoSe2 after 3 h of reaction, indicating that MoSe2 is of great benefit for improving photocatalytic activity. And when decorating Pt atop the MoSe2/g-C3N4 as an efficient electron trap, the remarkably strengthened hydrogen production can be further realized. Notably, the photocatalytic activity of 0.5P3MCN is much higher in comparison with those similar reported photocatalysts [23–25]. In order to examine the long-term stability of photocatalysts, the recycling test is performed (Fig. 6c). There is no noticeable decrease in the H2 evolution rate for the 0.5P3MCN photocatalyst after four cycles. Besides, the SEM images and XRD patterns of 0.5P3MCN photocatalyst before and after the photocatalytic reaction is showed in Fig. 6d. Apparently, after four catalytic runs, the position and the ratio of peaks are nearly the same to that of the fresh photocatalyst. And, the morphology of the Pt–MoSe2/g-C3N4 basically keep unchanged, clearly indicating the stability of the obtained photocatalyst. Based on the photophysical properties and electrochemical behaviors results, a tentative for high HER performance over Pt–MoSe2/g-C3N4 is illustrated in Fig. 7 a, under full-spectrum light irradiation, photo-electrons generated in the conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4 transfer to that of MoSe2 and the photo-holes are left on the valance band, then are rapidly onward to the Pt nanoparticle via the favorable intimate interfacial contacts, where the H2 evolution could be formed [26–31]. In the other hand, leaving holes in the VB of g-C3N4 are quenched by TEOA. Thus the charge separation on this photocatalyst system are promoted. The photocurrent responses are measured to understand the better separation of electrons and holes in the Pt–MoSe2/g-C3N4 photocatalysts. As illustrated in Fig. 7b, in comparison with pure g-C3N4 and 3MCN, the photocurrent density of Pt–MoSe2/g-C3N4 photocatalysts is greatly increased, this phenomenon indicates that strong interfacial contacts among Pt–MoSe2/g-C3N4 heterostructure with synergistic effect could effectively boost the separation process of photoinduced electrons and holes, which are beneficial to the high activity of HER. Furthermore, The pristine g-C3N4 poses a high PL emission peak, and the 0.5P3MC sample exhibits the lowest PL emission band, suggesting that the recombination of photoinduced carries could be enormously declinced in the Pt–MoSe2/g-C3N4 hybrid, elucidating the enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of this sample [32,33]. As the HER overpotential is a critical factor that used for evaluating the photocatalytic HER activity, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements is performed (Fig. 8 a). It is apparent that the 0.5P3MC sample shows the lowest overpotential compared with g-C3N4, 1MCN and 3MCN under the same current density. Moreover, the obviously efficiently accelerate the charge transfer in 0.5P3MCN heterostructures is investigated by Nyquist plots (Fig. 8b). The 0.5P3MCN sample presents the smallest semicircle diameter, this essentially demonstrates the smallest interfacial charge transport resistance in the hierarchical heterojunction system, confirming the better interfacial charge transfer ability during the charge transfer process. Thus, the cocatalyst MoSe2/g-C3N4 with loading Pt nanoparticles possesses the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution."
6,Conclusions,"In summary, Pt anchored on MoSe2/g-C3N4 is reasonably synthesized and explored toward photocatalytic H2 generation. The obtained sample exhibits a significantly strengthened photocatalytic hydrogen production activity than single Pt loaded g-C3N4 or MoSe2 decoreted g-C3N4. The results are attributed to the synergistic effect for enhancing the interfacial electron transfer in the MoSe2/g-C3N4 heterojunction coupling with Pt nanoparticle, in which Pt served as an electron collector could afford more charge transfer channels for accelerating the photo-generated charge carriers. Moreover, Pt could provide a decreased overpotential for hydrogen evolution due to its lower overpotential than g-C3N4. It is expected that this kind of ternary multicomponent heterostructure possesses great potential toward highly efficient solar hydrogen production."
