0,Introduction,"Transition metal complexes containing redox-active ligands have attracted much attention to redox behaviors and their electronic structures in the past few decades [1–6]. Especially in the field of bioinorganic chemistry, the phenoxyl radical-coordinated various metal complexes have been synthesized and characterized in order to understand the roles of the metal-phenoxyl radical species in metalloenzymes such as galactose oxidase and glyoxal oxidase [7–18]. Galactose oxidase (GO) is a mononuclear copper oxidase catalyzing primary alcohol oxidation to the aldehyde, and its active form is known to be assignable to a Cu(II)-mono(phenoxyl radical) species [17,18]. A generally accepted mechanism of the catalytic cycle includes the hydrogen atom abstraction from the α-position of the primary alcohol as the rate-determining step, based on the large kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measured by using the deuterated substrate [18]. Stack and co-workers have demonstrated catalytic primary alcohol oxidation with Cu(II) complexes of diimine-diphenolate Schiff base, “salen-type” ligands, whose catalyst has similar reactivity trends to GO [8a]. We have carried out the precise kinetic analyses of stoichiometric benzyl alcohol oxidation by the one-electron oxidized Cu(II)-salen-type complexes, in order to reveal the relationship between the electronic structure of the one-electron oxidized complexes and the reactivity towards primary alcohol [12,13]. The benzyl alcohol oxidation by the one-electron oxidized Cu(II) complexes of the salen-type ligand with tert-butyl-substituted phenolate moieties showed that the hydrogen atom abstraction occurs in the rate-determining step, and the Cu(II)-mono(phenoxyl radical) species was specified as the vital reactive species [12,13]. On the other hand, the one-electron oxidized Cu(II) complexes with the methoxy-substituted ligands showed different mechanisms for the benzyl alcohol oxidation involving the electron transfer in the rate-determining process [13]. Thus, the benzyl alcohol oxidation mechanisms with the one-electron oxidized salen-type complexes depend on the change in the ligand, especially by the substituent replacement. From the viewpoint of substituents, the phenoxyl radical cofactor in GO has a C–S covalent bond at the ortho-position of the phenoxyl radical by the Tyr 272–Cys 228 cross link [19], which could be considered to play important roles in the catalytic cycle of primary alcohol oxidation [17,18]. It has been recently demonstrated that the methylthio group substitution on the phenolate moieties in the salen-type complexes affected the electronic structures of the complexes, such as inducing the π-π stacking interaction to stabilize metal-(phenoxyl radical) species. [11a,14]. Therefore, the benzyl alcohol oxidation reactivity of one-electron oxidized Cu(II)-(salen-type ligand) complexes would be significantly influenced by the alkylthio substitution of two phenolate moieties. In the present study, detailed reaction analyses of the benzyl alcohol oxidation by the one-electron oxidized Cu(II)-salen complexes having the methoxy- or the methylthio-group at the para-position of two phenolate moieties, [1] + and [2] + (the structures of the precursor Cu(II) complexes 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 1 ), were carried out in order to evaluate the effect of the C–S bond on the reactivity. The relationship between the electronic structures of the one-electron oxidized complexes and their benzyl alcohol oxidation mechanisms are discussed. As further interests, the reactivity of two-electron oxidized Cu(II)-salen-type complexes have never been examined in detail to the best of our knowledge, though the formation of the two-electron oxidized complexes with the para-substituent R on the two phenolate moieties, [Cu(R-1,2-salcn)]2+ (R = MeO or MeS), has been reported to form as relatively stable species [8f,g]. We have succeeded in quantitative generation of the two-electron oxidized complexes, [1] 2+ and [2] 2+ , in solution, and analyzed their oxidation mechanisms of benzyl alcohol in order to understand the primary alcohol oxidation reactivity of the two-electron oxidized Cu(II)-salen-type complexes."
1,Experimental Section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All the reagents were of the highest grade available. All the solvents for the isolation of the oxidized complexes and for the solution analyses including kinetic measurements, and benzyl alcohol as the substrate were purified by standard methods [20]. The H2(R-salen) ligands were synthesized and recrystallized by similar procedures of the previous report [11a]. The precursor Cu(II) complexes, Cu(MeO-salen) (1) and Cu(MeS-salen) (2), were prepared by similar procedures for syntheses of the general Cu(II)-(salen-type ligand) complexes by the reaction of anhydrous Cu(CH3COO)2 with H2(R-salen) in ethanol [12,13]. Hexafluoroantimonate salt of thianthrene radical cation (C12H8S2 •+SbF6 –) as an oxidant was prepared according to the literature [21]."
3,Syntheses of one-electron oxidized Cu(R-salen) complexes,"2.2 Syntheses of one-electron oxidized Cu(R-salen) complexes 2.2.1 [Cu(MeO-salen)]SbF6 ( [1] SbF6) A 5 mL of CH2Cl2 solution of 1 (12.6 mg, 25.0 μmol) was added into a vial containing C12H8S2 •+SbF6 – (11.3 mg, 25.0 μmol), and the mixture was stirred for a few minutes. After filtration, pentane (15 mL) was added slowly to the filtrate to separate into two layers and the resulting solution was kept stand overnight below −20 °C to give [1]SbF6 as dark brown plate crystals. Yield: 17.5 mg (85%). Elemental analysis (%) calculated for [1]SbF6•0.75CH2Cl2 (C26H34N2O4CuSbF6•0.75CH2Cl2): C, 40.08; H, 4.46; N, 3.49.

The resulting solution was poured into dry diethyl ether (85 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for a few minutes to give [2]SbF6 as dark blue precipitate. Yield: 15.0 mg (78%). Elemental analysis (%) calculated for [2]SbF6•0.5CH2Cl2 (C26H34N2O2S2CuSbF6)(CH2Cl2)0.5: C, 39.18; H, 4.34; N, 3.45. Found: C, 39.48; H, 4.27; N, 3.48."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements of complexes 1 and 2 in CH2Cl2 were performed at 293 ± 2 K by using BAS ALS-600A and 600C electrochemical analyzers. A glassy-carbon disk as a working electrode, a platinum wire as a counter electrode, and Ag/0.1 M AgNO3 in acetonitrile as a reference electrode were used. The redox potentials of the sample solutions were calibrated by using the ferricinium/ferrocene (Fc+/0) redox signal. The concentrations of 1 and 2 were adjusted to 1 and 0.05 mM, respectively, to obtain the reversible redox signals. The concentration of supporting electrolyte was adjusted to 0.1 M by using tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4)."
5,Spectrophotometric measurements for the oxidation of Cu(R-salen) complexes,"2.4 Spectrophotometric measurements for the oxidation of Cu(R-salen) complexes The 0.05 mM solution of Cu(R-salen) (complex 1 or 2) in CH2Cl2 (10 mL) was added into a vial containing the calculated amount of C12H8S2 •+SbF6 –. Immediately after sonication for a few minutes, the UV–vis-NIR spectra of the resulting solution were recorded on a JASCO V-670 spectrophotometer at 293.0 ± 0.5 K."
6,Resonance Raman spectroscopic measurements for one-electron oxidized complexes,"2.5 Resonance Raman spectroscopic measurements for one-electron oxidized complexes Resonance Raman spectra of the CH2Cl2 solution (0.25 mM) of the MeO-salen complexes 1 and [1] + were obtained with a single polychromator (MC-100DG, Ritu Oyo Kougaku) attached with a liquid N2 cooled CCD detector (CCD-1024 × 256-OPEN-1LS, HORIBA Jobin Yvon) with the use of a HeCd laser (IK4101R-F, Kimmon Koha) at 441.6 nm excitation wavelength. Resonance Raman spectra of the CH2Cl2 solution (0.25 mM) of MeS-salen complexes 2 and [2] + were recorded with a single polychromator (500IS, Chromex) attached with a liquid N2 cooled CCD detector (Spec-10: 400B/LN, Roper Scientific) with the use of Verdi (Coherent) and Model 375 Dye laser (Spectra Physics) at 590 nm excitation wavelength. A holographic super notch filter (Kaiser Optical Systems) was used to minimize the Rayleigh scattering, and spectra of solvated samples were collected in spinning cells (0.5 cm diameter, 330 rpm) at –60 °C in all Raman experiments. A 135° back scattering geometry was adopted and data accumulation time was 10 min. The laser power at the sample point was 20 mW for 441 nm and 35 mW for 590 nm excitation. Peak frequencies were calibrated relative to indene standards (accurate to ± 1 cm−1)."
7,Kinetic measurements for the benzyl alcohol oxidation by oxidized salen complexes,"2.6 Kinetic measurements for the benzyl alcohol oxidation by oxidized salen complexes Kinetic measurements were carried out by time-resolved spectrophotometry using Shimadzu UV2550, JASCO V-660 and V-670 spectrophotometers equipped with temperature-controlled cell holders. All sample solutions were kept constant at the targeted temperature within ± 0.1 °C. The sample solutions of the one-electron oxidized complexes were prepared by dissolving [1]SbF6 or [2]SbF6 in CH2Cl2. On the other hand, the sample solutions of the two-electron oxidized complexes were prepared by addition of the CH2Cl2 solution of the precursor Cu(II) complexes to a vial containing the stoichiometric amount of C12H8S2 •+SbF6 − (2.0 equiv. to the complexes). The sample solution (2.4 mL) in a 10-mm quartz cell was adjusted to the appropriate reaction temperature and the reaction was initiated by addition of the calculated amount of the substrate directly into the cell. The spectral and absorbance changes with time for kinetic analyses were collected under the conditions that the total concentration of the substrate was in large excess over that of the copper complex (C BnOH ≫ C Cu). The spectral changes with time were analyzed by SPECFIT program [22] for assignment of the number of the reaction steps and the order of the reaction with respect to the Cu complex concentration. The conditional rate constants were obtained by applying non-linear least-squares fittings of the following equations [23–26]: (i) At = A ∞ + (A 0 − A ∞) / (1 + k obs 2nd C Cu t) to the absorbance change with time at 440 nm for the reaction of [1] + as one-step second-order kinetic analysis; (ii) At = A ∞ + αexp(−k obsI 1st t) + βexp(−k obsII 1st t) to the absorbance change with time at 468 and 592 nm for the reaction of [1] 2+ and [2] + , respectively, as consecutive two-step first-order kinetic analysis; and (iii) At = A ∞ + αexp(−k obsI 1st t) + βexp(−k obsII 1st t) + γexp(−k obsIII 1st t) to the absorbance change with time at 612 nm for the reaction of [2] 2+ , as consecutive three-step first-order kinetic analysis, where A 0, At and A ∞ are the absorbances at the reaction time = zero (0), a given time (t) and infinite time (∞), respectively, α, β, and γ are composite parameters, and k obs 2nd, k obsI 1st, k obsII 1st, and k obsIII 1st are the conditional rate constants. Kinetic isotope effect (KIE, k H/k D) was measured in a similar manner to that mentioned above by using α-benzyl-d 2-alcohol (C6H5CD2OH) and benzyl alcohol-d (C6H5CH2OD) at 293 K. These deuterated substrates were prepared as reported previously [8b,8c,12], and they were used immediately after purification [12,13]."

9,General characterization of one- and two-electron oxidized complexes in CH2Cl2,"3.1 General characterization of one- and two-electron oxidized complexes in CH2Cl2 Two-step one-electron oxidations of 1 and 2 in CH2Cl2 were confirmed by the electrochemical measurements. Cyclic and differential pulse voltammograms (CV and DPV) of both 1 and 2 (Fig. S1) showed two reversible one-electron redox processes. The two redox potentials corresponding to the first and the second oxidation processes of complexes 1 and 2 at 293 K were determined from the DPV peaks to be E 1 = 0.25 and E 2 = 0.41 V (vs Fc+/0) for complex 1, and E 1 = 0.29 and E 2 = 0.39 V for complex 2, respectively. The redox potentials of complex 1 are essentially same as those recently reported (E 1 = 0.26 and E 2 = 0.43 V vs Fc+/0 at 298 K [27]). The E 1 and E 2 values obtained for complex 2 were similar to those of 1, while the difference between the two redox potentials of 2 (ΔE = E 2 – E 1 = 0.10 V) was somewhat smaller than that of 1 (ΔE = 0.16 V). Complexes 1 and 2 could be oxidized by chemical oxidant in CH2Cl2. In the spectrophotometric measurements for the oxidations of complexes 1 and 2 by one-electron oxidant, thianthrene radical cation salt (C12H8S2 •+SbF6 –), two independent isosbestic points were observed in the regions of the molar ratio of Cu complex : oxidant from 1 : 0 to 1 : 1 and from 1 : 1 to 1 : 2 (Fig. 2 ), with no appearance of the characteristic absorption band of the thianthrene radical cation (C12H8S2 •+) at 18400 cm−1. Further, two clear bending points in the absorbance were observed at the molar ratios of Cu complex : oxidant = 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 (Fig. S2). These observations indicate that both complexes 1 and 2 can be oxidized completely by addition of stoichiometric amount of the thianthrene radical cation to form the one- ([1] + and [2] + ) and the two-electron oxidized complexes ([1] 2+ and [2] 2+ ) in CH2Cl2. The one-electron oxidized complexes, [1] + and [2] + , were isolated as the hexafluoroantimonate salts, [1]SbF6 and [2]SbF6. The absorption spectra of the isolated complexes [1]SbF6 and [2]SbF6 dissolving in CH2Cl2 were essentially same as that of the above-mentioned 1 : 1 reaction mixture of the original Cu(II) complexes and the thianthrene radical cation salt (Fig. 2). Moreover, the UV–vis-NIR spectrum of complex [1] + in CH2Cl2 was identical to that of the recently reported complex [1] + , which was generated by using AgSbF6 as the oxidant [27]. The UV–vis-NIR spectra of the one-electron oxidized complexes in CH2Cl2 showed the phenoxyl radical π-π* transition bands at 21400 cm−1 for [1] + and 16300 cm−1 for [2] + . In addition, the weak and broad ligand–ligand charge transfer (LLCT) band from phenolate to phenoxyl radical at 7800 cm−1 for [1] + and 9300 cm−1 for [2] + was observed [8d,27]. These spectral features are in good agreement with the results of the previous report as the Cu(II)-mono(phenoxyl radical) complexes with relatively localized the radical unpaired electron on the one of the phenolate moieties [8d,8g,13,27]. The resonance Raman spectrum (λex = 441 nm) of oxidized complex [1] + exhibited characteristic new intense bands at 1507 cm−1 and 1608 cm−1, respectively (Fig. S3(a)). For metal-coordinated phenoxyl radicals, the Raman intensity ratio, I(ν8a)/I(ν7a), has been reported to be > 1, while the uncoordinated radical exhibits the intensity ratio of < 0.1 [28,29]. The band at 1608 cm−1 is readily assigned to the ν8a stretching mode of the metal coordinated phenoxyl radical, and the weak band at 1507 cm−1 is attributable to the ν7a mode. Such a trend was also observed in complex [2] + at 1510 cm−1 for ν7a and 1591 cm−1 for ν8a modes of the phenoxyl radical (Fig. S3(b)), which are in good agreement with the previous report of the methylthiophenoxyl radical complexes [11a]. Therefore, these results support that one-electron oxidized complexes [1] + and [2] + are the Cu(II)-phenoxyl radical complexes, [Cu(R-salen•)]+ (R = MeO and MeS). The reaction of the original Cu(II) complexes (1 and 2) with two equivalents of the thianthrene radical cation salt achieves quantitative formation of the two-electron oxidized complexes ([1] 2+ and [2] 2 + ) in solution, though these complexes are not currently isolated as the solid products with high purity. The UV–vis-NIR spectra of [1] 2+ and [2] 2+ exhibited that the absorption maximum of the phenoxyl radical π-π* transition band was similar to that in [1] + and [2] + , while the intensity was ca. twice higher than that of the corresponding one-electron oxidized complex (Fig. 2). Further, the LLCT band of [1] 2+ and [2] 2+ was completely disappeared, indicating that the oxidation states of the two phenolate moieties in complexes [1] 2+ and [2] 2+ were equivalent [8g]. The electronic structures of two-electron oxidized Ni(II)-salen-type complexes have been reported that the LLCT band can be detected in the Ni(III)-mono(phenoxyl radical) complexes, while the band of the Ni(II)-bis(phenoxyl radical) complex was disappeared [30]. From these considerations, it would be most plausible that both complexes [1] 2+ and [2] 2+ are assigned as the Cu(II)-bis(phenoxyl radical) complexes, [Cu(R-salen••)]2+ (R = MeO and MeS). Thus, the one- and two-electron oxidized complexes can be generated by addition of stoichiometric amounts of the thianthrene radical cation salt, and these oxidized complexes can be assigned to the mono- and bis-(phenoxyl radical) complexes. The one-electron oxidized complexes [1] + and [2] + were stable in CH2Cl2, and these half-lives at 293 K were estimated to be 120 and 37 h, respectively. The half-lives of the two-electron oxidized complexes [1] 2+ and [2] 2+ at the same condition were estimated to be 640 h, and 480 h for [1] 2+ and [2] 2+ , respectively, and thus the two-electron oxidized complexes were kinetically more stable than the one-electron-oxidized complexes in CH2Cl2. Therefore, the self-decay of all the oxidized complexes would be negligible in the following reaction analyses."
10,Benzyl alcohol oxidation by one- and two-electron oxidized complexes: Reaction product and stoichiometry,"3.2 Benzyl alcohol oxidation by one- and two-electron oxidized complexes: Reaction product and stoichiometry The addition of benzyl alcohol to the CH2Cl2 solutions of all the one- and the two-electron oxidized complexes caused irreversible disappearance of the characteristic phenoxyl radical absorption bands. The conversion of benzyl alcohol after completion of the reactions in the presence of large excess of benzyl alcohol was analyzed by a GC–MS method. The product for all the reaction systems was assigned to benzaldehyde, and the other products could not be detected. The yields were estimated to be ca. 50% for the one-electron oxidized complexes and ca. 100% for the two-electron oxidized complexes, relative to the initial amount of the one- and two-electron oxidized complexes. These results indicate the stoichiometric oxidations of the benzyl alcohol by the one- and two-electron oxidized complexes with [1] + or [2] + : substrate = 2 : 1, and [1] 2+ or [2] 2+ : substrate = 1 : 1, respectively. For the reaction system of complex [1] + , the UV–vis spectrum after the completion of the reaction was identical to that of original complex 1, indicating that the one-electron reduction of [1] + occurred through the reaction. Though the final spectra for the other complex systems were different from the corresponding original Cu(II) complexes, addition of base (Et3N) in the one-equivalent of the initial amount of [2] + , or two-equivalents of the initial two-electron oxidized complexes [1] 2+ and [2] 2+ into the reaction-completed solutions afforded the spectra of the corresponding original complexes 1 and 2. These observations strongly suggest the mono- and di-protonated species of the original Cu(II) complexes as the complex products, i.e., [2-H]+ and [1-2H]2+ or [2-2H]2+ for [2] + and two-electron oxidized complex [1] 2+ or [2] 2+ , respectively. Thus, the benzyl alcohol oxidations by the present oxidized complexes are summarized as Eqs. (1)–(3): 2 [Cu(MeO-salen•)]+ ([1] + ) + C6H5CH2OH → 2 Cu(MeO-salen) (1) + C6H5CHO + 2H+ (1) 2 [Cu(MeS-salen•)]+ ([2] + ) + C6H5CH2OH → 2 [Cu(MeS-salen-H+)]+ ([2-H]+ ) + C6H5CHO (2) [Cu(R-salen••)]2+ ([1]2 + or [2]2 + ) + C6H5CH2OH → [Cu(R-salen-2H+)]2+ ([1-2H]2+ or [2-2H]2+ ) + C6H5CHO (3)"
11,Reaction kinetics for benzyl alcohol oxidation by oxidized complexes,"3.3 Reaction kinetics for benzyl alcohol oxidation by oxidized complexes The absorption spectral changes for the benzyl alcohol oxidation by the oxidized salen complexes in CH2Cl2 were measured by the time-resolved spectrophotometric technique with a large excess of substrate over the Cu complex (C BnOH ≫ C Cu) at 293 K (Figs. S4–S7), and these spectral changes were analyzed by SPECFIT program [22]. The reactions with one-electron oxidized complexes were initiated by mixing the solution of the isolated complex, [1]SbF6 or [2]SbF6, and the substrate. In the case of the reactions with two-electron oxidized complexes [1] 2+ and [2] 2+ , which could not be isolated, the sample solutions of the complexes were prepared in situ by mixing the precursor Cu(II) complexes with 2.0 equivalents of the thianthrene radical cation salt and then mixed with the substrate. The reactions can be described to the following two types: one is the pseudo second-order kinetics for the reaction system of [1] + , and the other is the consecutive pseudo first-order kinetics for the other reaction systems. The second-order kinetics for the decrease of [1] + during the reaction was confirmed by the linearity of the (A 0 − A ∞)/(At − A ∞) vs time (t) plot (Fig. S8), where A 0, At and A ∞ denote the absorbance at t = 0, t, and infinite time, respectively [23–26]. Since the sample concentrations were adjusted to C BnOH ≫ C Cu, the reaction rate is expressed as Eq. (4) using the conditional pseudo second-order rate constant, k obs 2nd. (4) - d Cu complex / d t = k obs 2 nd Cu complex 2 Cu complex = 1 + Further, the formation of benzaldehyde by GC–MS was correlated with the decrease of [1] + observed in the spectral change (Fig. S4a). The multi-step first-order kinetics with respect to the decrease of the oxidized complex for the other reaction systems were confirmed by the plots of log |A ∞ − At | vs time [23–26]. The shift of the slopes of the plots revealed that the reaction proceeded in two steps for the reaction systems of [2] + and [1] 2+ (Figs. S9 and S10, respectively) and in three steps for [2] 2+ (Fig. S11). These results suggested that the starting complexes [2] + , [1] 2+ , and [2] 2+ convert to the intermediate complex (IStepI ) in the first step (Step I) of the reaction. In the case of [2] + and [1] 2+ reaction systems, the continuous reaction of the intermediate as the second step (Step II) affords the final complex product. However, the reaction of [2] 2+ consists of three steps, and the second intermediate complex (IStepII ) forms in the Step II followed by the formation of the final product complex in the third step (Step III). For all of the reaction steps, the reaction rate is expressed as Eq. (5), where k obs N 1st denotes the pseudo first-order rate constant for Step N (N = I, II, or III), and Cu complex denotes the reactant Cu complex species for each step; Cu complex = [2] + , [1] 2+ , or [2] 2+ for Step I, IStepI for Step II, and IStepII for Step III. (5) - d Cu complex / d t = k obs N 1 st Cu complex N = I , II , or III Although the reaction systems for [2] + and [1] 2+ were classified into the same type of kinetics described as two-step pseudo first-order kinetics, the benzaldehyde formation process was different. GC–MS analyses of these reaction systems revealed that the formation of benzaldehyde was observed in both Steps I and II of the reaction system for [1] 2+ , while benzaldehyde could be only detected in Step II of the [2] + system. On the other hand, Steps I and III in the reaction system of [2] 2+ were the main benzaldehyde production steps from the result that the formation of benzaldehyde could not be detected in the Step II."
12,Dependences of conditional rate constants on substrate concentration,"3.4 Dependences of conditional rate constants on substrate concentration The conditional rate constants in Eqs. (4) and (5) for all the reaction systems were obtained by non-linear least-squares fittings to the absorbance vs time data (Figs. S8–S11, also see Section 2.6 ). For the [1] + system with the pseudo second-order kinetics of C BnOH ≫ C Cu, the conditional rate constant k obs 2nd linearly depended on the concentration of benzyl alcohol with the zero intercept (Fig. 3 ). Therefore, k obs 2nd is expressed as Eq. (6) using the third-order rate constant k 3. (6) k obs 2 nd = k 3 C BnOH From the slope in Fig. 3, the k 3 value was obtained (Table 1 ). The Eq. (6) is expressed the first-order process on the substrate concentration, and therefore one substrate molecule participates in the rate-determining step. For the [2] + system assigned to the two-step pseudo first-order kinetics, both the conditional rate constants obtained for the Steps I and II (k obsI 1st and k obsII 1st, respectively) linearly depended on the concentration of benzyl alcohol with the significant intercepts (Fig. 4 ). Therefore, the k obsI 1st and k obsII 1st are expressed by the same equation as shown in Eq. (7), where k 1 N and k 2 N are the first- and second-order rate constants, respectively, for the Step N (N = I or II). (7) k obs N 1 st = k 1 N + k 2 N C BnOH The Eq. (7) indicates that the reactions in both reaction steps proceed in a couple of the zero- and the first-order concerning the concentration of benzyl alcohol, and the rate constants k 1 N and k 2 N for the Step N (N = I and II, Table 1) could be obtained from the intercept and slope in Fig. 4. The plots of k obsI 1st and k obsII 1st against the concentration of benzyl alcohol for the reaction of [1] 2+ are shown in Fig. 5 . The k obsI 1st obtained for the Step I was quadratically dependent with the concentration of benzyl alcohol (Fig. 5a), whose correlation could be analyzed by non-linear least-squares fitting of Eq. (8) using the second- (k 2 I) and the third-order (k 3 I) rate constants (Table 1). Therefore, the Step I is considered to be a couple of the reaction processes of the complex with two and one substrate molecules. (8) k obsI 1 st = k 2 I C BnOH + k 3 I C BnOH 2 On the other hand, the k obsII 1st obtained for the Step II was linearly dependent on the concentration of benzyl alcohol with the zero intercept (Fig. 5b). and could be analyzed by a linear least-squares fitting of the simpler equation of Eq. (7): (7′) k obsII 1 st = k 2 II C BnOH From the result, the order of the reaction with respect to the concentration of benzyl alcohol in the Step II is described to the first order. The correlations of three pseudo first-order rate constants in the reaction of [2] 2+ , k obsI 1st, k obsII 1st, and k obsIII 1st with benzyl alcohol concentration were shown in Fig. 6 . The k obsI 1st vs concentration of benzyl alcohol plot (Fig. 6a) showed a quadratic dependence, which is similar to that obtained for the Step I of the [1] 2+ system (Fig. 5a), Therefore, k obsI 1st is expressed as Eq. (8). On the other hand, the plots of k obsII 1st and k obsIII 1st with the concentration of benzyl alcohol (Fig. 6b and 6c) exhibited linear dependences with the zero intercepts, and k obsII 1st and k obsIII 1st are expressed as the same type of the equation as Eq. (7′). All the rate constants (k 2 I, k 3 I, k 2 II, and k 2 III) were obtained by similar fitting analyses to the Fig. 5a for the Step I and 5b for the Steps II and III (Fig. 6, Table 1). Thus, the reaction proceeds in a couple of the second- and the first-order in the Step I, while both the Steps II and III in the reaction are described to the simple first-order with respect to the concentration of benzyl alcohol."
13,Kinetic isotope effects,"3.5 Kinetic isotope effects In order to determine whether the C–H bond and/or the O–H bond cleavage is involved in the rate determining step(s) of benzyl alcohol oxidation, the reaction rates of all the reaction systems were measured using with two kinds of the deuterated substrates, C6H5CD2OH and C6H5CH2OD, at 293 K. However, any significant changes in the rate constants could not be detected using either deuterated substrate in all the systems (Tables S1–S4)."

15,Benzyl alcohol oxidation mechanisms by one- and two-electron oxidized complexes,"4.1 Benzyl alcohol oxidation mechanisms by one- and two-electron oxidized complexes Apparently from Results, the present four complexes, [1] + , [2] + , [1] 2+ and [2] 2+ showed different kinetics for the benzyl alcohol oxidation, and further, complexes [2] + , [1] 2+ and [2] 2+ were analyzed to the multi-step reaction mechanisms. These benzyl alcohol oxidation mechanisms are discussed based on careful consideration of the results. 4.1.1 Benzyl alcohol oxidation mechanism by one-electron oxidized MeO-salen complex [1] + The reaction kinetics of [1] + was the simplest in the present systems. The reaction at CBnOH ≫ C Cu irreversibly proceeded in one step to form complex 1 and benzaldehyde as the product, and the orders of the reaction were 2 with respect to the concentration of the [1] + and 1 with the concentration of benzyl alcohol. Therefore, the proposed mechanism can be described to the termolecular process with two complexes [1] + and one benzyl alcohol (Scheme 1 ). No significant of the kinetic isotope effect (KIE, k H/k D = 1.0) strongly suggests the simple electron transfer from a substrate molecule to the two complex cations in the rate determining step. 4.1.2 Benzyl alcohol oxidation mechanism by one-electron oxidized MeS-salen complex [2] + The oxidation by [2] + proceeded in two steps, both of which were assigned to the pseudo first-order kinetics at C BnOH ≫ C Cu. The Step I was described to a couple of k 1 I and k 2 I pathways including the zero- and the first-order processes with respect to the concentration of the [1] + , respectively. Formation of benzaldehyde could not be detected in the Step I, suggesting that the Step I was not involved in the oxidation process of the benzyl alcohol. Therefore, the Step I was considered to be a reversible association of [2] + with the substrate to form an associated complex intermediate of [2] + with C6H5CH2OH (Scheme 2 ), and thus the reversible process consists of the forward pathways as bimolecular (k 2 I) process and backward pathways as unimolecular (k 1 I) process. Although the Step II showed the same type of kinetics as the Step I involving unimolecular (k 1 II) and the bimolecular (k 2 II) processes, overall reaction of the Step II was irreversible process containing formation of benzaldehyde. Therefore, the Step II was proposed to the parallel of the two redox pathways composed of the “intra-intermediate” electron transfer (ET) in the association complex of [2] + with benzyl alcohol (k 1 II pathway) and the electron transfer in the association complex assisted by a free substrate molecule (k 2 II pathway) (Scheme 2). These k 1 II and k 2 II pathways would lead to the substrate radical,C6H5CHOH, which reacts rapidly with the other [2] + to give a benzaldehyde [7c,12,13]. From the present kinetic analysis, unexpected “substrate-assisted redox pathway” was included in the Step II, because benzyl alcohol may act as the temporary acceptor of the dissociated proton arising from the redox process. This consideration was supported that the final complex product of this reaction can be assigned to the proton adduct species [2-H]+ . However, the KIE could not be detected in the significant value (k H/k D = 1.1–1.2), suggesting that this proton transfer process to the complex was not included in the rate-determining ET process. 4.1.3 Benzyl alcohol oxidation mechanism by two-electron oxidized MeO-salen complex [1] 2+ The benzyl alcohol oxidation kinetics by [1] 2+ was assigned to two-step pseudo first-order processes. The Step I consists of a couple of the bimolecular (k 2 I) and termolecular (k 3 I) processes with Cu complex : substrate = 1 : 1 and 1 : 2, respectively. The benzaldehyde was detected in the Step I by the GC–MS analysis, suggesting that the Step I involved the benzyl alcohol oxidation process. Since no significant KIE (k H/k D = 1.0–1.1) was observed, the Step I was proposed to be a process of the two-electron transfer from a substrate to [1] 2+ (k 2 I pathway) associated with the “one-by-one” electron transfer process from two substrate molecules to [1] 2+ . In this mechanism, the intermediate complex (IStepI ) produced in the Step I should be [1-2H]2+ . However, the calculated absorption spectrum of IStepI by SPECFIT analysis [22] (Figs. S6(b) and (c)) suggests the formation of Cu(II)-mono(phenoxyl radical) species similar to [1] + (Fig. S12). This discrepancy may be due to the fast comproportionation process between [1-2H]2+ and unreacted [1] 2+ after the rate determining step to give a mono-protonated one-electron oxidized complex [1-H]2+ . Indeed, the comproportionation reaction of complex 1 and [1] 2+ rapidly completed to generate [1] + at least within 10 s. Therefore, the mechanism of the Step I was proposed that the rate determining step was the two-electron transfer and the “one-by-one” electron transfer reactions, followed by the fast comproportionation to form [1-H]2+ as the product intermediate (Scheme 3 ). The Step II can be assigned to the bimolecular process (k 2 II) between [1-H]2+ and the substrate. No significant KIE in this step (k H/k D = 1.0) strongly suggests the simple one-electron transfer from the substrate to [1-H]2+ in the rate-determining step (Scheme 3). The substrate radical is generated in the Step II, and it rapidly reacts to form benzaldehyde. 4.1.4 Benzyl alcohol oxidation mechanism by two-electron oxidized MeS-salen complex [2] 2+ Oxidation of benzyl alcohol by complex [2] 2+ was described to the three-step pseudo first-order kinetics at C BnOH ≫ C Cu. The Step I of this oxidation process can be considered to be very similar to the Step I of the [1] 2+ system from the similarity of the reaction kinetics and GC–MS analysis. In addition, the calculated spectrum of first intermediate complex (IStepI ) by SPECFIT analysis [22] suggested the formation of a Cu(II)-mono(phenoxyl radical) species similar to [2] + (Fig. S13). The mechanism of this Step I is considered to be identical to that of the Step I of the [1] 2+ system (Scheme 4 ). The rate-determining step consists of the two-electron transfer and the one-by-one electron transfer reactions from benzyl alcohol to [2] 2+ to give benzaldehyde, and then the fast comproportionation occurs to form the mono-protonated one-electron oxidized complex intermediate [2-H]2+ . On the other hand, the Steps II and III can be explained to the similar kinetics as bimolecular process (k 2 II and k 2 III) between the intermediate complex and the substrate. The kinetics are expressed as more simplified equation in comparison to the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with complex [2] + , suggesting that the Steps II and III was not involved any unimolecular process. Benzaldehyde was only generated in the Step III by GC–MS analysis, and therefore the Step II was assigned to the association process of complex [2-H]2+ with benzyl alcohol. The mechanisms of the Steps II and III can be proposed as similar to the Steps I and II for oxidation of benzyl alcohol with complex [2] + (Scheme 4). Therefore, the associated complex of [2-H]2+ with the substrate was formed as an irreversible intermediate in the Step II, and then the substrate-assisted redox reaction proceeded to form [2-2H]2+ and benzaldehyde in the Step III."
16,Relationship between electronic structures of one- and two-electron oxidized complexes and their benzyl alcohol oxidation mechanisms,"4.2 Relationship between electronic structures of one- and two-electron oxidized complexes and their benzyl alcohol oxidation mechanisms Both one-electron oxidized salen complexes [1] + and [2] + were assigned to the Cu(II)-mono(phenoxyl radical) species, which have relatively localized radical unpaired electron on one of the phenolate moieties as class II mixed valence system by Robin and Day classification [31]. In addition, the redox potentials of complex 1 and 2 were similar to each other, indicating no significant differences in the redox behaviors of these complexes. However, the benzyl alcohol oxidation kinetics of [1] + and [2] + were different. The reaction mechanism of [1] + can be explained by the simple two-electron transfer process from the substrate to the two complex cations (Scheme 1), which is very similar to that of the previously reported [Cu(MeO-salophen)]+, where MeO-salophen is a salen-type ligand with 1,2-phenylenediimine linker and para-methoxy substituted phenolate moieties [13]. On the other hand, the benzyl alcohol oxidation by [2] + proceeded in two steps. The associated intermediate reversibly formed in the Step I, and then the one-electron moved from benzyl alcohol to the complex in the associated intermediate with and without the assistance of the substrate molecule (Scheme 2). To the best our knowledge, determination of the kinetically detectable associated complex intermediate would be the first example for the reaction of Cu(II)-mono(phenoxyl radical) complexes, though the rapid pre-equilibrium of the associated complex intermediate has been specified in the kinetic study on the benzyl alcohol oxidation of a Cu(II)-(4,5-dimethoxy-diiminobenzene radical) complex, [Cu(salophen-(MeO)2)]+ having a Schiff base ligand of two di(tert-butyl)phenolate connected with 4,5-dimethoxy-1,2-phenylenediimine linker [13]. The associated intermediate of [2] + with the benzyl alcohol molecule may be stabilized by π-π stacking interaction, which could be induced electron transfer from the benzyl alcohol to the phenoxyl radical [14]. On the other hand, in the redox reaction step of the Step II, the substrate-assisted redox pathway other than the “intra-intermediate” redox pathway is kinetically assigned, and the benzyl alcohol may act as the temporary proton acceptor to transfer the proton to the complex. The benzyl alcohol oxidation mechanisms of the one-electron oxidized Cu(II)-(salen-type ligand) complexes previously reported are classified as follows: (a) the hydrogen abstraction on the α-carbon of benzyl alcohol by the complex to form the substrate radical in the rate determining step for the reactions of the 2,4-di(tert-butyl)phenoxyl radical complexes, [Cu(1,2- or 1,3-salcn)]+ [8b,8c,12] and [Cu(salophen)]+ [13], (b) the one-by-one electron transfer from the substrate to two complex cations in one step for the reactions of [Cu(MeO-salophen)]+ [13] and complex [1] + , (c) the formation of the associated complex intermediate in a pre-equilibrium followed by the rate-determining electron transfer for the reaction of [Cu(salophen-(MeO)2)]+ [13], and (d) two-step reaction consisting of the associated complex formation and the following electron transfer as mentioned for the reaction of complex [2] + . Thus, the benzyl alcohol oxidation mechanisms by one-electron oxidized Cu(II) complexes with salen-type ligands vary dependent with the ligand structure as well as the substituents. In addition, the redox behaviors of the Cu(II)-salen-type complexes have no significant relationship with their reaction mechanisms. Therefore, these mechanistic differences would arise from the difference in the electronic structure such as the radical-electron distribution among these complexes. Since the present complexes [1] + and [2] + are characterized as the Cu(II)-mono(phenoxyl radical) species from only the solution analyses, the further detailed electronic structure analyses would be required. The reaction mechanisms of [1] 2+ and [2] 2+ with benzyl alcohol are also proposed in order to clarify the reactivity of two-electron oxidized salen-type complexes. The reaction mechanisms in the Step I are identical with each other. The results strongly suggest that the electronic structures of [1] 2+ and [2] 2 + , especially the radical-electron distributions, are very similar to each other, i.e., localized Cu(II)-bis(phenoxyl radical) species, as expected from the assignments of their absorption spectra. On the other hand, though the intermediate complex generated in the Step I for both the systems is assigned to the corresponding mono-protonated one-electron oxidized complex species [1-H]2+ and [2-H]2+ , the mechanism in the following steps was different from each other, as the above-mentioned reaction mechanisms of the one-electron oxidized complexes. It should be noticed that the mono-protonated MeS-complex intermediate [2-H]2+ still interacts with the substrate molecule to form the associated complex {[2-H]2+ , C6H5CH2OH} in the Step II, suggesting that the methylthiophenoxyl radical would prefer the π-π stacking interaction of the phenoxyl radical with the phenyl ring in the benzyl alcohol [14]. Both proposed mechanisms of one- and two-electron oxidized MeS-salen complexes [2] + and [2] 2+ involve not the hydrogen atom abstraction but the electron transfer process in the rate-determining step, because KIE = 1 was obtained for all the reaction steps. On the other hand, the stabilization of the associated intermediates of one-electron oxidized complexes [2] + and [2-H]2+ with the substrate were kinetically suggested as mentioned above. Therefore, the C–S covalent bond on the phenoxyl radical complexes would affect rather the stabilization of the Cu(II)-mono(phenoxyl radical) species than the hydrogen atom abstraction process in the rate-determining process of the primary alcohol oxidation by GO."
17,Conclusion,"The one-electron oxidized salen complexes with methoxy ([1] + ) and methylthio ([2] + ) substitutions at para position of the phenolate moieties were isolated, and both complexes were assigned to the Cu(II)-mono(phenoxyl radical) species in CH2Cl2. However, their benzyl alcohol oxidation mechanisms were different. Oxidation of benzyl alcohol with [1] + can be assigned to the two electron transfer mechanism from one substrate to two complexes [1] + in the rate determining step, while the mechanism of [2] + could be expressed to the formation of the associated intermediate of [2] + with benzyl alcohol in the first step (Step I), followed by the “intra-intermediate” and “substrate-assisted” electron transfer process in the second step (Step II). Oxidation mechanisms of two-electron oxidized MeO- and MeS-salen complexes ([1] 2+ and [2] 2+ ) assignable to the Cu(II)-bis(phenoxyl radical) species in CH2Cl2 revealed that the first benzyl alcohol oxidation step (Step I) proceeds through essentially same mechanism to form the corresponding mono-protonated one-electron oxidized complex intermediate [1-H]2+ or [2-H]2+ . In the following reaction step(s), the considerably different mechanisms between the [1] 2+ and [2] 2+ systems were observed. [1-H]2+ showed the simple bimolecular redox process between [1-H]2+ and the substrate in the Step II, while the associated complex intermediate formed in the Step II of the reaction system of complex [2] 2+ , followed by the substrate-assisted electron transfer process in the Step III. These results strongly suggest that the reaction mechanisms of the Step I of the Cu(II)-bis(phenoxyl radical) complexes are identical, while those of the Cu(II)-mono(phenoxyl radical) complexes including their mono-protonated intermediate species drastically change depending on the substitution at para position of the phenolate moieties. Further, the Cu(II)-mono(methylthiophenoxyl) radical species prefer to generate kinetically hemi-stable associate complexes with the benzyl alcohol substrate. The formation of the associate complexes may closely relate to the preference to the weak interaction such as the π-π stacking interaction observed for the other methylthiophenoxyl radical complexes [6,14]."
