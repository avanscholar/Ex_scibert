0,Introduction,"The field of alternative energy production is growing in response to climate change awareness, fossil fuel costs, and energy security concerns. Accessible, environmentally friendly, sustainable, secure sources of energy that can meet projected energy requirements are needed [1]. Hydrogen is expected to play a larger role in the future energy portfolio [2,3]. Among different sources and methods of hydrogen production, plasma assisted reforming of hydrocarbons shows promising results [4–9]. Biogas from landfills contains 40 to 60% methane with the balance being largely carbon dioxide. <2% of the biogas is typically nitrogen, oxygen and other trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [10]. Because methane is 20 to 25 times more potent a greenhouse gas (GHG) than CO2, decomposing municipal solid waste can be a serious climate change contributor. The U.S. EPA predicts global biogas emissions will grow by 13% between 2010 and 2030 [11]. Sulfate reducing microorganisms produce hydrogen sulfide in landfills. H2S is hazardous due to its effects on both humans and materials, corroding metal components in pipelines, sensors, engines, etc., and poisoning catalysts in fuel cell applications [12]. For proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell road vehicles [13], the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) dictates a limit of 0.004 μmol total sulfur compounds (as H2S) per mole of H2 at the dispenser nozzle [14,15]. Thus, practical use of biogas as hydrogen feedstock depends on economical removal of H2S to meet these limits. Converting H2S into easily removed sulfur forms may enhance removal between the reformer and the fuel cell. This paper explores reforming of simulated biogas, a nominally 50:50 mixture of methane (a renewable hydrocarbon) and carbon dioxide, in a non-thermal gliding arc plasma reactor stabilized in a reverse vortex flow (RVF). Operating conditions that minimize the specific energy ratio (defined as the energy input as power to the arc divided by the number of moles of hydrogen produced) were identified using response surface methodology. The fate of hydrogen sulfide at contaminant concentrations in the simulated biogas is also explored to identify operating conditions that minimize sulfur concentration in the dry biogas reformate."
1,Hydrocarbon reforming technologies,"1.1 Hydrocarbon reforming technologies Reforming uses carbon sources (gas, liquid, solid) to produce hydrogen with general goals of maximizing hydrogen production while minimizing carbon monoxide production, although several other process performance indicators may be appropriate as will be discussed later. Partial oxidization (POX), auto-thermal reforming, and steam reforming (SR) [16] are three primary industrial fuel reforming techniques [17]. Eqs. (1) and (2) describe general methane reforming and ideal methane steam reforming, respectively. The latter is endothermic and typically occupies a large system footprint, experiences thermal lag, and requires expensive catalysts. (1) CH 4 + nH 2 O + mO 2 → xCO + yCO 2 + cH 2 O + dH 2 + eCH 4 … (2) CH 4 + 2 H 2 O → CO 2 + 4 H 2 ΔH = 165 kJ / mol POX (Eq. (3)) and auto-thermal reforming are both exothermic, oxidizing a fraction of the fuel stream to propagate the reforming reactions. Auto-thermal reforming, a combination of steam reforming and POX [17], requires specific reactant ratios and high temperatures. It is prone to coking, catalyst deactivation [18], and slowly responds to system changes making it impractical for mobile applications [5,19]. (3) CH 4 + 0.5 O 2 → CO + 2 H 2 ΔH = − 36 kJ / mol Since the 1990's, plasma reforming technologies have been employed to reform diesel, renewable diesel [20,21], methane [3–5,7–9,20,22], ethanol [20], isooctane [8,22], toluene [23] and gasoline [24]. Advantages of plasma reformers include reduced system cost, reduced catalyst deterioration (if a catalyst is employed), a smaller footprint, rapid response time, and the ability to reform heavy hydrocarbons [5,17,24–27]. Plasma reformers can also be configured to operate at near ambient temperatures [26,28,29]. Electrode erosion at high temperature and electricity input requirements are potential disadvantages. Plasmas generally falls into one of two categories - thermal or non-thermal. In a thermal plasma, gas molecules and electrons exist in thermal equilibrium. Scales range from 1 kW to over 50 MW [20,26] and create temperatures ranging from 5000 to 10,000 K. At these high temperatures, the electrodes must be cooled to reduce thermal erosion [20].The gas molecules and electrons in non-thermal plasma are not in thermal equilibrium. The gas molecules can exist at near-ambient temperature, while the electrons are excited at 10,000 to 100,000 K (1–10 eV) [19]. Non-thermal plasma reformers require electrical energy on the order of 102 W, have low electrode erosion, avoid the need for a cooling system, occupy a small footprint, and are low weight [20]. For similar hydrogen yields, non-thermal plasma reformers require less energy input, when compared to their thermal counterparts [6]. Pornmai et al. [30] studied plasma reforming of a 70:5:5:20 mixture of CH4:C2H6:C2H8:CO2 using reactant steam. The gliding arc reactor was fed with 100 cm3/min of “simulated natural gas” with O2 added to produce a hydrocarbon to O2 molar ratio of 2:1 and 10% molar steam. The energy cost was reported to be 7.62 eV/H2 molecule produced. Chun et al. [31] used a gliding arc reactor that was equipped with three fan-shaped electrodes located 120° apart. An external gas burner kept the plasma reactor at 580 °C followed by a catalyst reformer at 700 °C. The optimum working condition, reported at a steam to carbon ratio (SCR) of 3.0, had a SER value of 3.00 eV/H2 molecule produced with 100% CH4 conversion and 59% H2 selectivity. It should be noted that the energy spent preheating the plasma and catalyst reformer was not considered. In a study done with a gliding arc reactor in co-axial electrode configuration, Li et al. reported that the heat insulated reactor equipped with Ni-based catalyst running on biogas has an advantage of auto-reduction of the catalyst during start up. The inlet gas molar ratio was CH4:CO2:O2 = 3:2:1.8 and SER of 48 kJ/mol H2 (without catalyst) and 17 kJ/mol H2 (with catalyst), and energy efficiency of 50% (without catalyst) and 86%(with catalyst) were achieved [32]."
2,Plasma reforming of hydrogen sulfide,"1.2 Plasma reforming of hydrogen sulfide Elemental sulfur and its compounds have application in different sectors, such as food, agriculture, energy and power production [33,34]. The Claus process is a conventional method for recovering elemental S from H2S. In this process, H2S is converted to elemental sulfur (S) and water (H2O) via a two-step reaction shown in Eqs. (4) and (5) [35]. (4) H 2 S + 1.5 O 2 → SO 2 + H 2 O thermal step (5) SO 2 + 2 H 2 S → 3 S + 2 H 2 O catalytic and thermal step Direct decomposition of H2S into H2 and S, shown in Eq. (6) can also extract S from H2S. (6) H 2 S → H 2 + 1 2 S 2 ΔH r = 20.4 kJ / mol ΔG = 33.3 kJ / mol Positive changes in enthalpy and Gibbs free energy across Eq. (5) indicate an endothermic and non-spontaneous reaction. For example, only 12% conversion of H2S occurs at 1000 °C and 1 atm pressure, while below 550 °C < 1% conversion takes place [36]. Recent thermodynamic calculations at 1250 K by Nunnally et al. indicate that an energy input of 4 eV/H2 molecule (386 kJ/mol-H2) results in <20% H2S conversion [37]. An in-depth review by Luinstra concluded that the relatively low energy requirement of thermal and plasma methods makes them promising compared to electrochemical and photochemical methods [38,39]. Only Eq. (4) appears favored for contaminant levels of H2S (~100 ppmv) in biogas from landfills undergoing plasma reforming. Various non-thermal plasma systems have been studied for disassociation of H2S, including dielectric barrier discharge, rotating glow, pulsed corona discharge, microwave discharge, gliding arc discharge, and radio frequency discharge [36,40–43]. Early stage technology for H2S disassociation to form H2 required roughly 500 eV/H2 molecule produced [44,45]. Nunnally et al. [37] enhanced the flat gliding arc geometry with the gliding arc in tornado (GAT) and greatly reduced energy requirements to 1.2 eV/H2 molecule produced. The decrease in energy requirement stems from increased gas contact with the plasma in a GAT system and the associated improvement in energy transfer. The result, 25% H2S conversion to H2, was produced at atmospheric pressure, a pure H2S gas flow rate of 14 slpm, specific energy input of 0.31 eV/H2S molecule, and ~240 W power input to the system. Using the same GAT system, 2.8 slpm O2 was added to the 14 slpm H2S flow, achieving a specific energy value of 1.0 eV/H2 molecule produced [46]."
3,"Gliding arc tornado (GAT), reverse vortex non-thermal plasma","1.3 Gliding arc tornado (GAT), reverse vortex non-thermal plasma Biogas reforming using methods such as microwave discharge [47], plasma shade [48], and AC-pulsed gliding arc discharge have been studied [18,30,31,47,49]. Stabilization of gliding arc plasma within a reverse vortex flow has shown encouraging results [4,50]. Gliding arcs and forward vortex reactor chambers [18,31,32] have been used to reform biogas. Fig. 1(a) shows schematic of conventional gliding arc where the arc propagates in the Z direction and move upward with time. Fig. 1(b) depicts a 3D schematic of the gliding arc reverse vortex flow plasma used in this study. A stable gliding arc ignites between the top and bottom electrode and propagates by rotating around the Z axis. The reverse vortex increases the residence time of the reactant within the plasma arc and produces a more uniform gas treatment than conventional gliding arcs [51]. Gases swirling along the reactor wall produce near-perfect thermal insulation, and the movement of the arc reduces thermal erosion and eliminates the necessity to fabricate the reaction chamber from materials with high-temperature tolerance [51]. Forward vortex reactors have the same tangential gas injection at one end of the cylindrical reaction chamber, but with an axial exit at the opposite end. This report uses the reverse vortex flow reactor to reform simulated landfill biogas. Unlike the work by Pornmai et al. [30] and Chun et al. [31], the present study explores direct reforming of the biogas without additional catalyst or additional energy consumption for heating the plasma reformer. The reverse vortex flow reactor advantages of increased contact between the reactants and the arc and better thermal management are apparent in the experimental results. Reforming gases with different CH4:CO2 ratios have yielded promising results in other types of reactors, however information on reforming biogas by reverse vortex flow reactor and also the fate of contaminants is severely lacking. This study seeks to address this information gap, by adding hydrogen sulfide to biogas reformed in the partial oxidative environment of the reverse vortex flow gliding arc reactor."
4,Materials and methods,"This section describes the testbed, sample characterization in different states of solid, gaseous and liquid, system parameters, parametric tests, and the factorial experimental design utilized in system optimization. Fig. 2 shows the reforming testbed used for biogas and sulfur management in this study."
5,Testbed modifications,"2.1 Testbed modifications Reactant delivery, reformer, reformate conditioning, and analysis modifications were made prior to conducting experiments with simulated biogas containing 0 to 45 ppm of H2S. To prevent sulfur loss by adsorption, all the wetted surfaces exposed to fuel and reformate were converted to sulfur inert materials, i.e. metals subjected to the SilcoNert® process (SilcoTek, Bellefonte, PA, USA), ceramics, or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The reactant delivery system is shown in rectangle-A of Fig. 2. It consists of nitrogen and oxygen compressed gas cylinders and mass flow controllers (Brooks 5850E, USA) controlled by LabView running on a computer. Steam was generated by metering deionized water (Eldex 38 M 1/800 piston pump) to a heated section of delivery tube immediately upstream of the reactor. A permeation tube device (Model 491, KIN-TEK Laboratories, Inc., La Marque, TX USA) was used to meter 0 to 45 ppm of H2S into a premixed, synthetic biogas (50%–50% methane‑carbon dioxide) stream that entered the reformer via the tangential-inlet zirconia plate. PTFE tubing was used between the Kin-Tek and the reformer. A 3 mm PTFE line bypassed the reformer to allow calibration of gas analysis equipment directly from the reactant delivery system. The reformate conditioning system is shown in rectangle-B of Fig. 2. Sulfur containing reformate passed through two glass impingers in series. The first impinger contained 100 ml of isopropyl alcohol (A416 2-Propanol Certified ACS Plus, Fisher Scientific, Hanover Park, IL) and the second was empty. Both were immersed in an ice water bath. A 6 mm diameter, 53 cm long PTFE sleeve lined the first impinger from the base of the 3 way valve at the outlet of the reformer to the bottom of the impinger inlet tube. The PTFE sleeve collected any precipitated solids that plated onto the tubing and was removed for examination after each test. Exiting the impinger train, the reformate passed through a coalescing filter to capture remaining aerosol liquids and a mass flow meter (Model FMA1820A-ST-N2-EPR, Omega Engineering Inc., Norwalk, CT) to measure dry gas flow rate. A pump (Model R271-FT-EA-1, Air Dimensions, Deerfield Beach, FL) pulled a slip stream of the reformate through the sample loops of two gas chromatographs (GC) in series. The GC's identified major gas species and sulfur compounds. The remainder of the gas stream was vented into a fume hood. The GCs and the pump are shown in Fig. 2 rectangle-C. The online gas analyzers (Oxymat, Calomat, and Ultramat), mass flow meters, and Horiba gas conditioner shown in the upper right of Fig. 2 were all sulfur incompatible and were only used in a bypass mode for transitioning between test points when sulfur was absent from the system. The entire reactor system was housed in a plexiglass enclosure to isolate it from laboratory personnel. The enclosure was placed directly beneath a canopy hood to remove heat and fugitive emissions. Fig. 3 depicts a cross sectional image of the gliding arc reverse vortex flow reactor. A lead wire and inconel washer were embedded into the non-conducting zirconia (AmZirOx 86, Astro Met Zirconium Oxide, Cincinnati, OH) plate. The inconel washer served as the lower electrode and formed the axial exit orifice of the reactor. The end plate at the top of the reactor was a solid Macor (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) plate with an upper electrode access port. All electrode materials were treated with SilcoNert®."
6,Gaseous sample characterization,"2.2 Gaseous sample characterization A GC (Model 2014, Shimadzu, Colombia, MD) equipped with a sulfur chemiluminescence detector (SCD) (Sievers-355) and a 60 m long capillary column (RestekTM Model Rtx®-1) with a 0.53 mm internal diameter, 7 μm stationary phase was used to quantify sulfur species. A second GC (Model 14A, Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 1.52 m × 3 mm Carboxen™ 1000 column (SUPELCO, Bellafonte, PA) quantified permanent gas species, N2, CO, CO2, H2, and CH4 in accordance with ASTM Standard D1946-90 – Standard Practice for Analysis of Reformed Gas by Gas Chromatography. Each set of reformer test conditions were maintained for 40 min with sampling occurring at 10 min intervals on both GCs."
7,Liquid sample characterization,"2.3 Liquid sample characterization Liquid samples collected from the impingers were analyzed for sulfur containing species with a dual Dionex ICS-1100 ion chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) with a conductivity detector. Anion analysis took place with a Dionex Ion Pac AS14A (4 mm × 250 mm) column, utilizing 8 mM Na2CO3 and 1 mM NaHCO3 eluent at 1.0 mL/min with an AERS 500 suppressor at 43 mA. Anions were calibrated against Dionex 7 Anion-II. Cation analysis took place with a Dionex Ion Pac CS12A (4 mm × 250 mm) column, utilizing 20 mM methanesulfonic acid eluent at 1.0 mL/min with a CERS 500 suppressor at 59 mA. Cations were calibrated against Dionex 6 Cation-II. The pH was measured with an Accumet® Research AR25 Dual Channel pH/Ion Meter (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA)."
8,Solid sample characterization,"2.4 Solid sample characterization An analytical balance (model ME204E, Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, Ohio) was used to weigh the PTFE impinger liner before adding Swagelok hardware to the tube for connection to the system, post-test after hardware removal, and after 3 weeks of desiccation at 20–30% relative humidity. The mass gain of the tube resulted from solids collecting on the tube walls during tests. The tube was then halved lengthwise, sectioned into 10 pieces, and the dimensions and mass of each section were recorded. Adherent solids were removed from the tubing with a PTFE spatula and placed on a polished aluminum microscopy stub. A Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) produced images of the sample on the stub at 25,000× magnification, at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV, and gun current of 20 μA. Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) spectra acquired with an Oxford INCA PentaFet-x3 Si(Li) EDS allowed for qualitative identification of solid species present in the sample."
9,System variables,"2.5 System variables System variables are categorized into dependent and independent variables in Table 1 . Variable 1, the reactor chamber geometry affects the residence time of reactants within the reactor. The nonthermal plasma reactor used in these tests had a fixed geometry (42 mm ID, 100 mm length, 0.138 l total volume). Variable 2, the post reactor chamber geometry, was fixed with an inner diameter of 42 mm, a length of 76 mm and a total volume of 0.105 l. The electrode gap distance, Variable 3, dictated the minimum power level necessary to sustain arc ignition and in these tests remained fixed at 25 mm. Variable 4, Oxygen input, combined with fuel input, dictates the equivalence ratio (EQR) and the air fuel ratio (AFR), defined in Eq. (7). (7) EQR = AFR Reaction AFR Stoichiometric , where AFR = n ̇ air n ̇ fuel where ṅ air and ṅ fuel are the molar flow rates of air and fuel, respectively. In this reforming context, the value of EQR could range from 0 to 1.0, with EQR = 0 corresponding to no O2 present in the reactant flow and EQR = 1.0 corresponding to the reactant ratio of O2 to CH4 equal to 2.0, that needed to completely convert CH4 to CO2 and H2O. Variable 5, nitrogen input, was another fixed independent variable. Nitrogen volumetric flow was set 3.77 times greater than oxygen in order to produce synthetic air,21% O2 and 79% N2. Premixed synthetic biogas, Variable 6, was metered from a compressed gas cylinder to the reactor system using a mass flow controller. The CH4 component of the biogas was used in the AFR and EQR calculations. Variable 7, steam input to the system, was controlled by a precision metering pump and this independent variable was included in the steam to carbon ratio (SCR) calculation. Arc power (W), Variable 8, delivered by the power supply affects the number of electrons in the arc available for ionization of neutral particles. Note that power input was monitored but voltage and current were not. Variables 9 and 10 are dependent system variables. Power input level, reactant gas inputs, and electrodes gap distance (length of the arc) all affected reactor temperature. Inlet gas flow proportions were varied to produce the desired reactant gas ratios. The input flow and the reactor conditions dictated the reformate volumetric flow rate."
10,Experiment design and analysis methodology,"2.6 Experiment design and analysis methodology In this section outlines testing methodologies. Initial parametric tests were followed by factorial tests. Reactor performance was then optimized using a central composite design method. 2.6.1 Parametric tests Parametric testing focused on characterizing reactor performance changes as individual independent parameters were varied. Four independent experimental variables – equivalence ratio, steam to carbon ratio, plasma power, and sulfur input – were explored to determine their effects on system performance. The range of values for each independent variable and their base case values are shown in Table 2 . Combinations of variables that (1) either produced soot, (2) caused the plasma arc to behave erratically, or (3) produced conditions where the plasma arc could not form between the electrodes, defined operational system boundaries. 2.6.2 Factorial tests design A 23 full factorial design, 8 points per test, exploring the effects of the independent variables EQR, SCR, and power input, were used to identify the system operating conditions that minimized the specific energy requirements (SER) (Eq. (8)). (8) SER = Input Plasma Power n ̇ CO + n ̇ H 2 produced kJ / mol H 2 produced where input plasma power is measured in kW, and ṅ is molar flow rate in mol s−1. Eq. (8) assumes that the water gas shift reaction shown in Eq. (9) can convert all CO present in the reformate to H2. This assumption is also made for efficiency calculations. (9) H 2 O + CO → H 2 + CO 2 ΔH = − 41 kJ ⋅ mol − 1 Factorial design center points and step sizes were based on parametric test results. Analysis of main effects, second order effects, and higher order effects, identified a path of steepest descent (POSD) toward optimal operating conditions. After the system stabilized, a minimum of four samples were taken at ten minute intervals for each set of operating conditions. Multiple samples provided data to calculate a mean, standard deviation, and confidence intervals at each test point. 2.6.3 Central composite test design Central composite design (CCD) augments the factorial design with a set of axial points as shown in Fig. 4 . In order to find optimal conditions where factorial analysis has shown significant curvature between corner points and the center point, a CCD response surface design modeled the curvature and found the SER minima. The data was analyzed via Minitab® software package (Minitab Inc., State College, PA)."
11,Data reduction,"2.7 Data reduction The following equations define standardized performance indicators for plasma reformers proposed by Petipas et al. and derived from the primary experimental test data [19]. Eq. (10) defines hydrogen yield as the ratio of hydrogen atoms as molecular hydrogen in the reformate gas to the hydrogen atoms in the input fuel. (10) Hydrogen Yield = Hydrogen Atoms in H 2 in reformate Hydrogen Atoms in Feed Fuel × 100 % Eq. (11) defines hydrogen selectivity as the ratio of hydrogen atoms present in the reformate as diatomic hydrogen (H2) to the total number of H atoms present in the dry reformate. Again, it is assumed that all CO present in reformate can be converted to hydrogen by the water gas shift reaction (Eq. (9)). (11) Hydrogen Selectivity = Moles H 2 Produced 2 Moles CH 4 Converted × 100 % Efficiency is defined as the ratio of chemical enthalpy of the H2 present in the reformate to the total power input to the reactor - including the input plasma power and the enthalpy of the injected fuel flow. As seen in Eq. (12), ṁ and LHV, are mass flow rate and lower heating values of identified species, respectively. (12) Efficiency η = LHV H 2 gas ∙ m ̇ H 2 + m ̇ CO produced Plasma Power + LHV fuel ∙ m ̇ fuel input × 100 % Eq. (13) defines methane conversion as the reactor's ability to convert methane into other species. (13) Methane conversion = m ̇ C H 4 in fuel − m ̇ C H 4 in reformate m ̇ C H 4 in fuel × 100 % Depending on the focus of the reforming application, performance parameters such as O2 or H2O conversion or CO selectivity or yield may also of importance and could be calculated with simple modification to these equations."
12,Results and discussion,"In this section the results of parametric tests, factorial tests, and response surface tests (central composite design) are summarized and discussed."
13,Parametric tests,"3.1 Parametric tests This section discusses the parametric test results from the investigation of the effects of four independent variables, EQR, SCR, power input, and H2S input. Response of system performance metrics as a function of equivalence ratio are shown in Fig. 5 . Methane conversion decreases approximately 40% as EQR decreases from a high of 0.7 to 0.1. To reduce EQR, the air flow rate to the reactor is held constant while increasing the fuel flow rate, producing a more fuel-rich input mixture. Efficiency and H2 yield increase 10 to 15% (absolute) as the EQR decreases. Over the same range selectivity increases roughly 30% (absolute). The decreasing EQR also resulted in an exponentially decreasing SER values from 1017 kJ/mol of H2, toward an asymptotic value of 285 kJ/mol of H2 produced. Thus, the higher the biogas input to the system the better the reformer performed as measured by the decreasing SER value. All indicators of system performance are comparable with similar system operated on pure methane [4]. The effect of steam to carbon ratio was investigated while keeping EQR, power and inlet dry gas flowrate constant at 0.14, 220 W, and 3.5 lpm, respectively, while varying the steam input. Fig. 6 indicates that across a SCR range from 0 (POX conditions) to 3.0, the H2 yield increases from 22% to 27.5%, while efficiency decreases ~4% from 26.8% to 22.7%. CH4 conversion also showed an 8% reduction from 64% to 56%. Increasing SCR resulted in an increase in SER from 290 to 345 kJ/mol H2. H2 selectivity increased linearly across the SCR range, from 34 to 49% indicating that the decrease in methane conversion did not result in decreased H2 productivity. With the exception of hydrogen yield and selectivity, system performance parameters show similar trends to those measured for pure methane reforming [4]. The increasing SCR for biogas tests increased hydrogen yield and selectivity whereas similar tests on methane [4] found that selectivity remained constant and hydrogen yield decreased from 30.9% at an SCR of 0.5, to 17.0% at an SCR of 3.0. The difference may be the result of high CO2 concentrations present in the biogas inhibiting reactions. The slight increase in SER (by 55 kJ/mol H2 from zero steam to SCR = 3.0) with increasing SCR can be explained by the higher energy needed to energize water molecules. The parametric test for power input to the plasma began at 280 W and incrementally decreased the power input until the arc could no longer be sustained. Fig. 7 indicates increasing power results in linear increases in all indicators of system performance, albeit at different rates. The slope of the SER response was the steepest, increasing from 255 kJ/mol of H2 at 140 W to 345 kJ/mol of H2 at 280 W, a 35% (relative) increase. Methane conversion, the second most sensitive parameter, increased 25% (relative) over the test range, while H2 yield increased by ~32% (relative). Selectivity and efficiency remained fairly constant with increases on the order of 2% (absolute). Fig. 8 shows the parametric test results of varying H2S content in the bio-gas input flow. H2S contents of 5.3 to 45.4 ppm in the biogas flow resulted in 2.3 to 19.9 ppm H2S in the bulk inlet gas stream. Over this range, H2S reformate concentrations increased from 0.047 to 0.171 ppm, while SO2 increased linearly from 0.47 to 0.82 ppm. This indicates the great capability of the proposed system by removing 88% of the sulfur species at the 5.3 ppm input test condition to 94.8% removal at 45.4 ppm input. The right axis at Fig. 8 shows how the ratio of sulfur detected in the reformate gas to the sulfur in the inlet changes with increasing H2S inlet concentration. The remaining sulfur compounds in the gas stream exponentially decreased approaching an asymptote of ~5%. However, these measurements must be viewed qualitatively as all H2S concentrations were below the GC-SCD's calculated lower detectable limit (LDL) of 0.21 ppm, and the majority of the SO2 was detectable but under the 0.70 ppm calculated lower quantitative limit (LQL)."
14,Factorial tests,"3.2 Factorial tests The following sections present test results for the factorial tests and response surface methodology (RSM) approach to finding optimum operating conditions for biogas as a feedstock for the NTP reformer. The center point for the factorial tests was selected based on parametric test results and is summarized in Table 3 . The −1 and +1 designations in Table 3 show the center point minus and plus the step size respectively. Table 4 summarizes the main effects of the three input variables EQR, SCR, and power, along with second and third order interaction effects. Assuming the highest order effects are negligible [52], the third order effect can be considered as an estimate of error for the system. Hence, only effects with absolute values >105% of the absolute value of the third order effect (ABC) were considered significant. First order effects indicate that increasing the EQR has significant negative effects on all performance parameters except methane conversion. Increasing the EQR has positive effects on methane conversion as conditions approach stoichiometric AFR and complete oxidation. Increasing the SCR has a slight positive effect on methane conversion but does not produce significant effects in any of the other performance indicators. Increasing power improves methane conversion and hydrogen yield but negatively impacts SER performance and has no effects on other performance indicators. Second order effects indicate that increasing EQR and SCR in tandem produces an additional 5% methane conversion. Increasing EQR and power in tandem resulted in an additional ~7% increase in methane conversion but with an additional 4% reduction in H2 selectivity. Increasing power and SCR at the same time provided an additional ~6% decrease in methane conversion. Although the factorial results showed SCR effects to be insignificant, decreasing steam input lowers steam generation energy costs and was included in the path of steepest descent (POSD) analysis. Before running the POSD tests, low-steam reactor stability was tested and verified. The POSD was characterized by decreasing all three variables until reaching system limits (arc extinction). Based on the POSD results, center point and step sizes for the second factorial test are summarized in Table 5 . This factorial test analyzes the response surface around the new center point to see if there is a further possible reduction in the SER. Table 6 summarizes the results for the second factorial test. The results indicate the effects of all three factors are significant, and suggest decreasing all three factors for the next path of steepest descent. ANOVA analysis however, shows a curvature P-value of 0.01 (<0.05) indicating significant curvature [52] between corner points and the center point. This suggests that the reactor is at near optimal conditions. Therefore, a central composite test was designed as explained in Section 2.6.3 and was performed to model the response curvature."
15,Response surface analysis,"3.3 Response surface analysis A central composite design (CCD) added six axial points to the last factorial test, and resulted in a quadratic surface model for SER response. The global minima on this surface identified operating conditions producing a minimum SER value. The optimum operating point required 160 W of plasma power, due to occasional arc instability at 150 W. Optimal conditions were defined by an EQR of 0.11, an SCR of 0.14, and 160 W of arc power and a 3.5 slpm dry gas input composed of 0.25 slpm O2, 0.95 slpm N2, 2.30 slpm of biogas, and 0.13 g min−1 steam input. These conditions produced a reformate flowrate of 3.71 slpm and the associated gas composition translated to a CH4 conversion of 49%, a H2 yield of 23%, a H2 selectivity of 48%, an efficiency of 25%, and SER of 184.18 kJ/mol H2 (1.91 eV/H2 molecule). The latter is significantly below the 3.37 eV/H2 molecule produced for conventional steam reforming of methane [53]. The optimal conditions reported apply to this specific non-thermal plasma reactor and their applicability at larger scales [54–56] should be investigated. Note that opportunities for system integration could be expected to improve overall system performance."
16,Comparison with thermochemical simulation,"3.4 Comparison with thermochemical simulation FactSage™ (CRCT, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) software package was used to calculate the equilibrium gas composition for the optimal input conditions. The arc power was used as the input value for the change in enthalpy between reactants and products, the experimental reactant flow rates were used as relative molar ratios of input reactants, and the equilibrium calculation was performed at 298 K, 1 bar. Table 7 compares reformate gas composition from the thermochemical equilibrium calculation with the experimental gas composition from the optimal point. Table 7 data were used to calculate ideal performance metrics for both equilibrium and experimental conditions, summarized in Table 8 . Thermochemical equilibrium calculations yielded an efficiency of 71% with 82% of reformate hydrogen predicted to be present as H2 and 18% as CH4. Differences between the experimental optimal point and calculated values are attributed to the non-ideality of the system. From a thermodynamic stand point, heat loss, incomplete mixing of reactants, and inadequate retention time of reactants in the reaction chamber, all contribute to non-ideal conditions."
17,Sulfur fate,"3.5 Sulfur fate This section discusses the fate of sulfur compounds in the biogas input stream. Detection limits prevented factorial optimization of H2S removal, however, 180 min duration center-point tests conducted at three unique operating conditions provided solid, liquid, and gas samples which further utilized in analyzing the fate of sulfur in the system. The operating conditions, summarized in Table 9 , resulted in an average SER of 312.79 kJ/mol H2 (3.26 eV/H2 molecule produced) for the three points). During these 180 min tests, 8.96 mg of sulfur was input to the system. Ultimately 46.5 ± 26.7% of the input sulfur was accounted for in the solid, liquid and gas analyses. To confirm that the plasma arc contributed to the removal of H2S, 20 ppm H2S in biogas with accompanying air and steam mixtures was injected into the reformer and allowed to pass through the system without the plasma arc energized. The outlet gas was analyzed and the concentration of H2S was identical to the inlet indicating that the design modification to make the working surfaces of the system inert to sulfur was successful. Additionally, the H2S biogas mixture was passed through the reactor without the arc energized and then through the impingers containing both IPA and deionized H2O. The H2S concentration in the outlet stream was unchanged from the inlet. Similar tests explored the fate of SO2 at 25 ppm in the bulk inlet gas passing through the system. When injected into the reactor without the presence of steam, SO2 suffered minimal losses. However, when steam was injected into the reactor as well, without the arc engaged, H2SO4 formed. This caused the SO2 concentration in the outlet gas stream to drop from 24.8 ppm to 0.72 ± 0.09 ppm, and the liquid recovered from the first impinger ultimately contained 59.9 ppm of sulfate. These results confirm the performance of the proposed system in cleaning the H2S contaminant from the inlet biogas. Even in case the NPT reactor converts H2S to SO2, results indicate it can be removed with minimal effort with water scrubbing. 21.25 ppm H2S in biogas was metered into the system, resulting in 9.35 ppm concentration in the bulk reactant stream. The plasma reforming removed the majority of H2S, leaving 0.069 ± 0.026 ppm on average in the reformate – less than the LDL of 0.21 ppm. Due to the oxidation of H2S into SO2 via the reaction in Eq. (4), SO2 was found in detectable, but not quantifiable amounts. Ultimately 5.7 ± 0.4% of the initial sulfur appeared to remain in the gas stream. Oxidation of a portion of the H2S stream resulted in the production of SO2. The SO2 in turn reacted with steam present in the reformer to form H2SO4, sulfuric acid. The first impinger in the impinger train, initially filled with 100 ml of IPA, captured both condensed steam and sulfuric acid. After 180 min of operation the impingers on average contained 249.6 ± 29.5 ml of solution. Impinger solution had a pH value of 3.8 as measured by the AR25 Dual Channel pH/Ion meter. The Dionex ICS-1100 Ion Chromatograph detected on average 17.6 ± 14.0 ppm sulfate ions. This corresponded to 3.4 ± 2.2 mg of sulfur, or 38.2 ± 24.8% of the input sulfur. Images A and B in Fig. 9 show the solid particles in situ on the PTFE liner, while image C shows the solid particles scraped from the liner onto the targeting stub. The solid formations, rods, plates, and spheres, in images A and B were crushed when scraped onto the targeting stub. Unfortunately, the solids would decay and ‘wander’ when exposed to the electron beam. This impeded the image quality and the identification of species present in the solids. On average, solid composition as determined by EDS was primarily oxygen (81.3 ± 3.3%), carbon (15.6 ± 3.0%), and sulfur (2.8 ± 0.8%). Some particles subjected to EDS contained 19.5% sulfur by mass, however, the large majority of particles contained ≤5%. Recoverable amounts of solid sample limited the analytical effort, however future work should explore transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis as tools for identifying solid composition. Of the three phases, the recovered solid contained 2.6 ± 1.5% of the input sulfur, the smallest of the three fractions. Sulfur in gaseous form accounted for about 5% of the input sulfur. Finally, sulfur recovered in liquid form accounts for 38.2 ± 24.8% of the input sulfur. This indicates that the proposed system removes hydrogen sulfide impurities from biogas while performing reformation into hydrogen rich gas. Further steps include study on higher flow rates and higher concentration of impurities. However, the current study range showed improvement in performance of the proposed system in removing hydrogen sulfide impurities as concentration increased."
18,Comparison to other works,"3.6 Comparison to other works There is interest in upgrading biogas to biomethane as a substitute for natural gas and removing H2S is a typical unit operation. Research has also focused on reforming H2S to produce hydrogen (see eq. 6), or to simply remove it. Process results for synthetic biogas containing H2S reformed to a hydrogen rich stream in a non-thermal plasma reactor reported here are, unfortunately, nearly impossible to compare to the literature due to lack of comparable studies. Comparisons are made in three relevant areas; studies using non-thermal plasma in order to reform biogas at atmospheric pressure (see Table 10 ), methods of treatment of biogas in order to remove H2S (see Table 11 ), and methods of reforming H2S by different plasma technologies (see Table 12 ). Table 10 indicates that gliding arc methods have the lowest energy costs. The summarized research includes inlet gas composition that contain only CH4 and CO2 [57–59], biogas with O2 added [47,60], biogas with air [49,57,61], and finally biogas with air and steam [30,49]. The inlet flowrates range from 0.1 slpm to 24 slpm. A direct comparison is often impossible due to different system specifications, but the standardized performance indicators proposed by Petipas et al. [19] for plasma reformers have been applied, to the extent possible, within the limits of the available data. The closest results resembling the gas composition for the current work are those that included steam in the inlet gas. Pornmai et al. [30] work on simulated natural gas with hydrocarbon to O2 ratio of 2:1 and 0.13 SCR resulted in a SER value of 7.62 eV/H2 molecule produced. To confirm that steam does not directly produce hydrogen in the plasma reactor, Pornmai et al. [30] flowed a 2:1, He:O2 mixture with 10% (mole) steam flow under the same plasma operating conditions and observed no H2 in the outlet stream. Chun et al. [31] attained an SER of 3.0 eV/H2 molecule produced with a gliding arc reformer and secondary catalyst bed operating on an inlet gas composition of 60% CH4 and 40% CO2 and an SCR of 3 (no oxygen was reportedly used). Liu et al. [62] achieved an SER of 1.6 eV/H2 molecule produced with a high CO2 concentration in the inlet gas; CH4:CO2 of 2:3. Liu et al. [49] also reformed simulated biogas with air addition, without steam, and at high inlet flow rate of 15 slpm, reducing the SER to 0.70 eV/H2 molecule produced. The latter work differs from the conditions reported here by having a higher CH4 concentration in the inlet gas, by excluding added steam, and by operating at a higher input flow rate (15 slpm compared to 3.66 slpm). The information in Table 11 indicates that the H2S removal methods have high removal efficiency but just until the absorbent saturation and H2S breakthrough. Except for Jones et al. which had ~96% removal efficiency in two days of run, none of the methods are comparable to the plasma reforming method in terms of long term of operable time without stopping the system. The non-thermal plasma reactor in the present study showed >95% H2S removal efficiency reaching below 0.4 ppm; from the synthetic LFG (50–50% CH4-CO2) contaminated with 21 ppm H2S (10 ppm in total input dry gas to the reactor). Moreover, most of the methods require regeneration of the adsorbent. In most cases, the references do not recommend regeneration due to the decay of efficiency. As discussed in the introduction the non-thermal plasma reactor does not require change of parts, e.g. electrodes, as other plasma methods may require due to corrosion. Table 12 compares specific energy requirement for H2S conversion in different types of plasma reactors. None of the methods is comparable to >95% H2S conversion as demonstrated in the current results. The next highest conversion in the table, 75%, was achieved with a gliding arc plasma reactor operating on 50 ppm H2S diluted in air at a relatively high SER value, 500 eV/H2 molecule [45] [48]. The considerably lower value of 3.26 eV/H2 molecule produced in the current work reflects that the bulk of the H2 was produced from CH4 rather than from the conversion of H2S. The second highest conversion value, 50%, was also from a gliding arc method. Nunnally et al. first tested adding tornado effect to the gas stream of a gliding arc plasma reactor and could reach an SER value of 1.2 eV/H2−molecule produced in converting 25% of their 14 slpm flow of pure H2S [37] [49]. They modified their method by adding 2.8 slpm O2 (equal to 20% of the pure H2S flow) and reached 50% conversion with SER value of 1.0 eV/H2 molecule [46] [50]. The present work demonstrated >95% conversion of 21 ppm H2S in biogas with a SER value of 3.26 eV/H2molecule produced. Parametric test varying H2S concentration in the present work showed increasing H2S conversion with increasing H2S concentration up to the maximum value tested, ~50 ppm in biogas."
19,Conclusions,"An experimental investigation was conducted to reform biogas into a hydrogen-rich gas stream and to characterize the fate of H2S present as a contaminant for the first time. For this purpose, a non-thermal plasma reactor was modified and systematic experiments designed and performed. Parametric, factorial, and response surface methodology (RSM) tests conducted sequentially identified the best reactor operating conditions that minimized specific energy requirements (kJ/mol H2). Optimal operating conditions of EQR = 0.11, SCR = 0.14, and 160 W of arc input power resulted in a minimized SER of 184 kJ/mol H2 for the reactor running on simulated landfill biogas (50% methane, 50% carbon dioxide). At these conditions, the reformate gas composition was 14.2% H2, 31.9% N2, 17.0% CO, 3.8% CH4, and 10.6% CO2, resulting in methane conversion of 48.8%, a hydrogen yield of 23.4%, hydrogen selectivity = 47.8%, and an efficiency of 25.3%. The obtained 185 KJ/mol H2 is well below ~340 kJ/mol H2 for steam reforming of natural gas. This performance was also well below other plasma conversion methods and indicates the suitability of gliding arc reverse vortex flow plasma in biogas conversion. Results from H2S conversion tests determined that approximately 5.7% of the sulfur input to the system as 21 ppm H2S in biogas was recovered as H2S in the dry outlet reformate stream, resulting in ~94% H2S conversion. The remainder of the sulfur was converted to SO2 that was captured as H2SO4 in downstream impingers or recovered as a solid of unknown molecular structure on PTFE tubing surfaces between the reformer and the impingers. This great conversion efficiency indicates the capability of the proposed system for simultaneous removal of hydrogen sulfide contaminants from inlet biogas beside reforming hydrocarbons into hydrogen rich gas. Future research should identify optimal conditions for biogas reforming at higher input flowrates as an approach to a more industrialized scale and optimize operating conditions for sulfur removal and for a wider range of contaminant sulfur species."
