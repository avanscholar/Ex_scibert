0,Introduction,"Worldwide interest in renewable energy has been necessitated by the need to divert from over reliance on fossil fuel based energy sources. Combustion of coal, natural gas and oil is a direct source of greenhouse gases (GHGs), most prominent being CO2 and other environmental harmful emissions [1]. GHGs emissions contribute to air pollution and induce climate change via global warming. Among different proposed alternatives to fossil fuels, particular attention has recently been addressed on reforming of biofuels to H2. Catalytic ethanol steam reforming has been widely studied and found to be a feasible and viable reaction pathway for H2 production [2–4]. Bio-ethanol produced by the fermentation of sugar cane, corn grains, and other starch-rich materials has several advantages compared to other raw materials since it is a renewable energy carrier and only slightly contributes to the greenhouse effect since CO2 is recycled through photosynthesis [5]. Furthermore, ethanol has a relatively high hydrogen content and its use in ethanol steam reforming (ESR) theoretically produces 6mol of H2 per mole of ethanol reacted by Eq. (1) [6–10]. (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 6 H 2 ; Δ H 298 = 174 kJ/mol The value of 174kJ/mol for enthalpy change applies to gas phase. When considering reactants are in the liquid phase, Δ H 298 = 347.4 kJ/mol is required in ESR reaction [11]. Although, ESR is a promising and mature technology for hydrogen production, yet high endothermic nature of the ESR reaction constitutes a major drawback with regard to system energy efficiency and promotion of side reactions [12,13]. Moreover, the overall reforming process consists of a complex network of reactions, such as ethanol dehydrogenation, dehydration, or decomposition, which may result in the formation of several by-products such as methane, carbon monoxide, ethylene, acetic acid, acetaldehyde, acetone, diethyl-ether and most important and detrimental; coke [14,15]. Apart from the common issues happening in ESR, to further enhance the rate of reaction, different catalytic systems have been investigated for ESR, including both precious/noble metals and transition metals. Contreras, et al. [16] reviewed catalysts for ESR and from the study; Rh, Ru, Pd, Ir, Ni, Co and Cu were found to be the most probable metals with high H2 selectivity. Support materials most widely investigated are CeO2, ZnO, MgO, Al2O3, zeolites-Y, TiO2, SiO2, La2O2CO3 and CeO2-ZrO2. Although noble metal catalysts, such as Rh, Pt, Pd, Ru and Re afford high activity over wide temperature ranges with relatively high space velocities [17–19], high costs and traces availability associated with such metals limits their application. Hence, the development of less expensive active and stable non-noble metal catalysts for ESR are highly desirable. Additionally, it has become a common trend to have bi/multi-metal catalysts, applied to the ESR process [20–25], where metals complement each other for optimum catalytic performance. Among the transition metals, Ni is widely employed in the industry because it has low cost and exhibit good activity and H2 selectivity in reforming processes owing to the excellent ability of C–C and C–H cleavage and sufficient oxygen transport capability [26–28]. Several studies have been performed on ESR over various supported Ni catalysts such as Ni/Al2O3, Ni/(La2O3, Al2O3, YSZ, MgO), Ni/CexTi1 − xO2, and nano-NiO/SiO2 [22,26,29,30]. Similarly, Ni over Zr-Ce and La-modified CaO sorbents has been investigated for hydrogen production from steam reforming of biogas [31]. However, Ni-based catalysts are susceptible to carbon deposition and sintering at elevated temperature [32]. Promisingly, studies have shown that highly active and stable Ni-based catalysts can be obtained through optimization of physicochemical properties by means of modified synthesis procedures [33] and/or structural [34] and surface promotion [35]. These alterations mainly seek to enhance the dispersion of Ni for improved activity and H2 selectivity. Moreover, suitable supports should be resistant to the high temperatures applied in ethanol steam reforming while maintaining the metal dispersion as high as possible during the reaction. Commonly, the type spinel oxides such as CeO2, SiO2 and ZrO2 are proposed as catalyst supports due to their stability in terms of resistance to coking and sintering [36–38]. Li, et al. [39] used a Ni/ZrO2 catalyst for steam reforming of ethanol for H2 production. However, with a Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst, Ebiad, et al. [40] established that the addition of CeO2 to ZrO2 increased the surface area for Ni dispersion, which translated to higher catalyst activity. TiO2 being a similar spinel oxide has added encouraging advantages including relatively low cost, abundance in availability, chemically/thermally and biologically stable and is non-toxic [41]. Previously, TiO2 catalysts have been extensively studied with respect to photo-catalysis [42–46]. However, from the study of Ye et al. [47], TiO2 addition was found to improve the redox capacity of CeO2 support in ESR. The catalytic activity of TiO2 depends on its crystalline structure, particle size, surface area and surface hydroxyl groups. On one hand, the dispersion of Ni on TiO2 could be improved by co-loading TiO2 with CeO2, SiO2 or ZrO2. Alternatively, other efficient, heterogeneous and green materials with porous or lamellar structure such as natural clay minerals could be considered because of their higher surface areas, high metal dispersion with reduced coke deposition and sintering resistance. Among the clay minerals, pillared clays constitute a group of mesoporous materials whose micro-particles can be used as support on which TiO2 nanoparticles can be fixed on the surface of a suitable matrix with particle size in the order of micrometers. Clay materials are low cost, environment friendly and have high surface area. Among the pillared clays, montmorillonite (MMT) is a type of natural clays which is multilayered and classified as crystal lattice of 2:1 layered silicates. Its crystal structure consists of layers made up of inner octahedral sheet sandwiched between two outer tetrahedral silicon layers. The MMT silicate layers are held together by relatively weak forces. Water and other relatively polar molecules can enter between the unit layers, causing its lattice to expand [48]. Therefore, silicate layers could experience dispersion during intercalation process and also have unique intercalation and exfoliation characteristics [49]. The application of MMT as a catalyst/support has shown increased catalytic activity in different heterogeneous processes [50–52]. Besides improving the thermal stability of TiO2 through intercalation, MMT has been found to manifestly provide high barrier properties such as reduced permeability towards water and alcohols. This property improves the hydrothermal stability of the catalyst [53]. Recently, NiO loaded over montmorillonite support was tested for hydrogen production from ethanol steam reforming and found best performance for selective H2 production due to high NiO dispersion with strong sintering and coke resistance effects by MMT support [54]. Similarly, Ni-CaO promoted MMT catalysts tested for ESR and found high activity and stability due to enhanced metal dispersion with minimized sintering and coke formation effects [55]. Therefore, it is promising to investigate Ni as an active metal over MMT-dispersed TiO2 catalyst for selective and enhanced hydrogen production via ESR reaction. The objective of this study is to design and fabricate montmorillonite supported Ni/TiO2 catalyst by a sol-gel assisted impregnation technique for steam reforming of ethanol for H2 production. The impact of several reaction parameters, related to reaction temperature, time on stream, steam-to-ethanol feed ratio and Ni/MMT loading on activity and stability performance of the catalyst is analyzed. Performance of a Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite catalyst in ethanol conversion, H2 yield and product distribution is critically discussed, based on experimental results. Furthermore, an extensive characterization study was carried out to ascertain the structure-activity relationship of the catalyst. The improved dispersion of Ni on TiO2 support by MMT could improve interaction between reactant species and the active sites of catalysts, making the Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite a promising catalyst for ethanol steam reforming."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Ni/TiO2 catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of Ni/TiO2 catalysts The chemicals used for the synthesis of Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles were Titanium (IV) Isopropoxide (TTIPO, 97%, Sigma-Aldrich) as a source of titanium (IV), isopropanol (99.8%, QRëC), acetic acid (99.8%, and QRëC) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich). Initially, TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared using sol-gel method according to our previous work [56]. The precursory of titanium solution was prepared with molar ratios; Ti (OCH (CH3)2)4:15 C3H7OH:CH3COOH. Typically, 1M acetic acid diluted in isopropanol was added drop wise into titanium solution of isopropanol for the hydrolysis process and stirred vigorously for 24h at room temperature. Next, specified amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O dissolved in isopropanol was added to the titanium sol and stirred for another 6h. Afterwards, sol was dried in an oven at 110°C for 24h under air flow and then calcined in a furnace at a rate of 5°C/min up to 500°C and held for 5h. The samples obtained were named Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles (Ni/TNPs). On the other hand, anatase TiO2 micro-particles (TMPs) (Sigma Aldrich) were used to prepare Ni-loaded TMPs via impregnation method. Typically, 1g TiO2 was dispersed in 50mL deionized (DI) water. Then, appropriate amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O dissolved in water was added to TiO2 solution and stirred for 1h, then over dried for 24h at 110°C under air flow. Finally, samples were calcined at 500°C for 5h and named NiO/TiO2 micro-particles (NiO/TMPs). The amounts of Ni loading levels in TMPs were 7wt.%, 10wt.%, 12wt.% and 15wt.% and named as 7% Ni/TMPs, 10% Ni/TMPs, 12% Ni/TMPs and 15% Ni/TMPs, respectively."
3,Preparation of MMT/TiO2 catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of MMT/TiO2 catalysts The montmorillonite (Bentonite, Sigma Aldrich) was used for the preparation of MMT/TiO2 nanocomposite catalysts. Initially, TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared using the sol-gel method as discussed previously. Typically, 30mL isopropanol was added to 10mL TTIPO solution and hydrolysis process was conducted using 1M acetic acid solution. The acetic acid diluted in isopropanol was added drop wise into titanium solution of isopropanol and stirred for 24h at room temperature. Next, appropriate amount of MMT dissolved in isopropanol was added drop-wise into the titanium sol. The process of gelation was continued by stirring the mixture at room temperature for another 6h until thick sol was formed. After aging, the slurry was dried in an oven at 110°C for 24h under air flow. The cake was finely ground and calcined in a furnace at a rate of 5°C/min up to 500°C and held at this temperature for 5h and named as MMT/TiO2 nanocomposites (TNCs)."
4,Preparation of Ni/MMT-TiO2 catalysts,"2.3 Preparation of Ni/MMT-TiO2 catalysts The Ni-loaded/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite catalysts were prepared using impregnation method. Typically, 1g of MMT/TiO2 nanocomposite was dispersed in 50mL DI water and stirred for 1h. Next, an appropriate amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O dissolved in water was added to mixture and stirred for 4h. Finally, samples were dried in an oven at 110°C for 24h under airflow and calcined at 500°C for 5. The samples were named as Ni-MMT/TiO2 nanocomposites (Ni/TNCs). Similarly, TiO2 micro-particles (TMPs) were used to prepare Ni-MMT/TiO2 micro particles samples and named as Ni-MMT/TMPs."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization All the catalyst samples were characterized using relevant physico-chemical methods. Crystalline structure and phase transformation analysis of samples were undertaken by X-ray diffraction (XRD), performed on Bruker D 8 advance diffractometer (Cu-kα radiation, λ=1.54Å, operated at 40kV and 40mA) at a rate of 1° min−1 from 2θ =1.5°80°. BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area, average pore volume and pore diameters were determined by N2 adsorption examined at −196°C. All the samples were degasified at 250°C for four hours under vacuum conditions. BET analysis was carried out by micrometrics 3Flex Version 3.01. FTIR spectroscopy was used to follow the evolution of catalyst surface species during temperature programmed desorption of ethanol. The technique obtained an infrared spectrum of absorption of the solid catalyst pellets. This was done by IRAffinity-1S equipment from Shimadzu Corporation. The microstructures, surface morphology and quantitative elemental analysis of the catalyst were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDX). Carl Zeiss Supra 35 VP SEM and Oxford instruments were used respectively. To monitor the extent of coke deposition on catalyst, raw and used catalyst particle sample were subjected to thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), performed by a TGA 8000 system from PerkinElmer instruments."
6,Experimental procedure,"2.5 Experimental procedure Experimental set up consisted of a feed, reaction and analysis section as shown in Fig. 1 . The feed to the reactor was a gas mixture of water, ethanol and nitrogen. Water-ethanol mixture was fed to an evaporator, operated at 150°C through a syringe pump (KDS-100), operated at 2mL/h. N2 was introduced as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 40mL/min, except for tests of space velocity. The evaporator was connected to the reactor through stainless steel tubes and connectors, maintained at 130°C by use of a heating tape to prevent condensation. The ESR reactions were carried out isothermally in a borosilicate glass tube. The catalytic bed, realized by sandwiching the powder catalyst (0.5g, diluted in quartz, with catalyst to inert weight ratio of 1:1) between quartz wool, was located in the annular section of the reactor (8mm i.d. and 29cm length). The reactor was placed in a three zone horizontal tube furnace (CARBOLITE, MTF 10/15/130) which was monitored by a programmable temperature controller. “K type” thermocouples were used to measure the temperature of the catalytic bed inside the reactor; in particular, in correspondence of the inlet, the middle and the outlet of the catalytic bed. The analysis section consisted of an online GC (Agilent 6890N network GC system) for product gas samples and an offline GC (Agilent 7820A GC system) for product liquid samples. For online GC, the FID detector was connected with an HP-PLOT Q capillary column (Agilent, length 30m. ID 0.53mm, film 40μm) for separation of C1–C6 hydrocarbons, alcohols and oxygenated compounds. The TCD detector was connected to UCW982, DC-200, Porapak Q and Mol Sieve 13 X columns for detection of C1–C5 compounds and light gases (H2, O2, N2, CO). The catalytic performance was evaluated through the conversion of ethanol (X ethanol), selectivity (S) and yield towards the main products (H2, CO2, CH4 and CO) and minor/negligible products (C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8, CH3CHO, CH3COOH, (C2H5)2O and (CH3)2CO), as listed in Table 1 ."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of calcined catalyst samples,"3.1 Characterization of calcined catalyst samples The XRD patterns of TiO2, MMT, 12% Ni/TiO2 micro-particles, 12% Ni/20% MMT-TiO2 micro-particles and 12% Ni/20% MMT-TiO2 nano-composite, calcined at 500°C for 5h are exhibited in Fig. 2 . The TiO2 micro-particles were in pure anatase phase with 101 peak located at 2-theta of 25.62°. Ni loaded TiO2 micro-particles demonstrated a similar peak but of a lower intensity. The MMT XRD pattern showed basal (001) reflection around 2θ =3.70°, due to inter-layer of clays. In case of 20% MMT loading on Ni/TiO2, the diffraction peaks were wider and weaker than those of catalysts prepared without MMT. Similarly, Ni and TiO2 containing MMT samples had dissimilar XRD patterns compared to the pure MMT. MMT peak (001) is present in the pure MMT sample but disappears in the Ni/MMT-TiO2 samples due to efficient dispersion MMT on TiO2 particles. Furthermore, this could be an indication that the original layers of MMT were destroyed and thinly deposited on TiO2. For Ni/MMT-TiO2 micro-particles and Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite samples, diffraction peaks are almost equivalent, exhibiting 2θ peaks at 25.318°, 37.811°, 48.053°, 53.916°, 55.057° and 62.716°, which are consistent with (101), (004), (200), (105), (211) and (204) planes associated with tetragonal anatase. A NiO peak is present in Ni/TiO2, Ni/MMT-TiO2 micro-particles and Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite samples but absent in bare TiO2 and MMT samples. The slight broadening of the TiO2 peak (101) for Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite is an indication of a smaller crystallite size as compared to the Ni/MMT-TiO2 micro-particles sample. Average crystallite sizes were calculated using Scherer’s equation, represented by Eq. (2). (2) D p = K λ β 1 / 2 cos θ where D p is crystallite diameter (nm), K is shape constant (0.94 for this study). λ is the X-ray source wavelength (1.5406Å), β1/2 is peak FWHM (degrees) and θ is Bragg’s angle of the 2θ peak. The crystal size of TiO2 NPs was 19nm, reduced to 11nm in Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite. The morphology and microscopic structure of catalysts was investigated using SEM as illustrated in Fig. 3 (a–e). Spherical particles with almost uniform size for TiO2 micro-particles are shown in Fig. 3(a). For TiO2 nano-particles, while the spherical shape is maintained, the size of the particles is reduced as depicted in Fig.3(b). The SEM images in Fig. 3(c–d) show MMT sheets and layers being almost smooth, lamellar and uniform shape, respectively. Fig.3(e) illustrates the SEM images of the Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite catalyst. The catalyst shows both MMT sheets and TiO2 nano-particles, thus creating a nano-composite. TiO2 particles are almost spherical in shape and uniform in size. Evidently, MMT layers are destroyed and produced delaminated MMT structure, over which Ni and TiO2 nanoparticles distributed inside MMT galleries and over the surface. The Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite sample can be classified as heterogeneous because the composite is a cluster of particles and sheets, both on a nano-scale. However, it is impossible to identify Ni due to its small weight percentage and efficient dispersion on MMT/TiO2 nanocomposite. The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution of the calcined Ni/TiO2 nano-particles and Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite are exhibited in Fig. 4 (a–c). From Fig.4(a), the isotherms of the samples are similar to type IV curves with hysteresis loops, corresponding to mesoporous materials [59]. Both samples exhibit increased absorption beyond P/P 0 =0.9. Curves are essentially identical, indicating minimal distortion of the TiO2 crystal lattice by MMT addition. Fig. 4(b), shows the relation of pore size distribution and pore volume of both the samples. Ni/TiO2 nano-particles show volume of pores in the pore diameter range of 5.54–183.77nm with central value 29.8nm at which highest pore volume detected. However, Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite has a different distribution with most of the pores being around 5.45–277.38nm with central value 17.5nm. Similar trends of pore size distribution could be seen in pore areas as depicted in Fig. 4(c). Evidently, both pore volume and pore areas are more concentrated towards the low pore diameter vicinity of the graph for Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite sample than Ni/TiO2 nano-particles. This suggests that the impregnation and structural modification of TiO2 results in small pores, probably due to the presence of MMT. In addition, smaller pores aid in inhibiting agglomeration, resulting in a higher Ni dispersion for the Ni/MMT-TiO2 composite catalyst. Similar observations has been reported previously [60]. The BET surface area, pore volume and pore size of Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles and Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite are summarized in Table 2 . The BET surface area of Ni/TiO2 was 15.46m2/g, while MMT loading on Ni/TiO2 nano-particles barely affected the BET surface area of the composite catalyst (15.384m2/g). BJH surface of Ni/TiO2 (11.68m2/g) was higher than the Ni/MMT-TiO2 (8.77m2/g) composite, whereas, t-plot micro-pore of 10.47m2/g was observed in Ni/MMT-TiO2 sample, somewhat, higher than the Ni/TiO2 (7.94m2/g) sample. This revealed that Ni/TiO2 sample has more mesopores than the Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite, evidently due to microporous structure of MMT. Furthermore, MMT addition could be assigned to the partial insertion of MMT particles, partly filling the structural and textural defects of the TiO2 support [61]. This revealed that BET surface area is not an influential factor to enhance the catalytic activity for hydrogen production. This can be attributed to the fact that MMT is a layered structure which could provide good interaction between MMT/TiO2 composite, which results in higher Ni-dispersion [54,55]. Furthermore, BJH pore volume of Ni/TiO2 sample is higher than Ni/MMT-TiO2 composite, while t-plot micro-pores have opposite reflections. In general, t-plot micro-pores volume is much lower than the BJH pore volume in both the samples, attributed to more mesopores than the micro-pores in both the samples. The BJH pore diameter of Ni/MMT-TiO2 is comparatively increased on MMT addition, probably due to MMT sheets being deposited on TiO2 pores."
9,Catalysts screening for H2 production,"3.2 Catalysts screening for H2 production The metal loading and nature of support is known to influence the performance of supported metal catalysts. Additionally, the structure of the support dictates the dispersion of the active metal, consequently influencing catalytic activity. For this reason, preliminary catalytic performance tests were conducted for hydrogen production during ESR reaction over Ni/TiO2 micro-particles, Ni/MMT-TiO2 micro-particles, Ni/TiO2 nano-particles and Ni/TiO2 nano-composite under the same operating conditions. Ni/TiO2 MPs and Ni/MMT-TiO2 micro-particles were prepared via impregnation method, while Ni/TiO2 nano-particles and Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite were prepared via a combination of the sol-gel and impregnation methods. The different samples were prepared, calcined at 500°C for 5h and tested for catalytic activity in ethanol steam reforming. Nickel loading was varied from (7 to 15wt.%), while the influence of MMT addition to TiO2 support was evaluated at 10 and 20wt.%. The summary of the yield rates and conversion of ethanol over different types of catalysts has been presented in Table 3 . Evidently, in homogeneous system, without using catalyst, both ethanol conversion and as a result, H2 yield were extremely low at 0.55 and 0.34%, respectively. This revealed, in the absence of a catalyst in the reactor affected the reaction through the decrease in space-time. Mildly improved results would be expected for a pure TiO2 sample, since, as a support, TiO2 would have minimal catalytic effect but would marginally increase the space-time for the reaction. Loading TiO2 micro-particles with 7wt.% Ni, significantly raised the values of ethanol conversion and H2 yield to 17.62 and 11.96%, respectively. Ethanol conversion and H2 yield were observed to be progressive up to 12% but regressed at 15% Ni loading. Ni contents and its dispersion dictate the activity of a Ni promoted catalyst; activity increases with Ni contents due to an increase in the number of active sites, whereas Ni dispersion decreases, hence limiting the same activity [62]. Generally, Ni content of conventional catalysts applied in ESR does not exceed 12wt.% to avoid aggregation and sintering of particles. Both Roy, et al. [63] and Vicente, et al. [64] applied a 10wt.% Ni loading on an Al2O3 and SiO2 support, respectively in ESR for H2 production. Aggregation of Ni species could be inhibited through increased dispersion of Ni metal on the catalyst support. Having established 12wt.% as the optimum Ni loading on TiO2 micro-particles, the effect of MMT addition on catalyst activity was investigated. Increasing the MMT amount from 10 to 20wt.% increased ethanol conversion by 11.6% and H2 yield by 7.2%. This can be attributed to MMT increasing dispersion of Ni particles on the TiO2 micro-particles. Interestingly, the increase in MMT amount from 10 to 20wt.%, suppressed CO yield by almost 50%. However, attempts to further add to the MMT-loading above 20wt.%, resulted in the clay/TiO2 slurry converting into hardened cake upon calcination. Therefore, optimal of 20wt.% MMT-loaded into TiO2 is selected for further investigation of Ni-incorporation. The effect of structural modification was further evaluated by comparing the performance of micro-particles, nanoparticles and nanocomposites materials. Using 12wt.% Ni/TiO2 micro-particles, the conversion of ethanol achieved was 53.77%, increased to 71.55% over 12% Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles. Similarly, efficiency was further increased in 12wt.% Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composites, while conversion reached to 84.41%. Similarly, the yield rate of H2 was increased with the change in support structure from micro particles to nano-particles of TiO2, whereas, the highest yield of ethanol obtained was 55.54% with 12% Ni-MMT-TiO2 nanocomposite catalyst. This revealed that support has significant effect on the conversion and yield rate during ESR process. This is because more active sites and efficient Ni dispersion can be achieved using nanostructures than the micro-particles. The addition of MMT further improve the Ni dispersion, results in enhanced process efficiency and similar observations have been reported previously [54]. Nano-particles and nano-composites exhibit similarities in their size range (nano-scale) but differ in terms of regularity of their structures. The irregular structure of the nano-composite sample proved to offer a higher dispersion for Ni, resulting in high ethanol conversion and hydrogen yield rates. Previously, low temperature ethanol steam reforming for hydrogen production was conducted by Lee at al. [65] over Sn-incorporated SBA-15 catalysts, while Rossetti et al. [66] investigated the use of Ni, Co and Cu metals incorporated over SiO2 and ZrO2 supports in ethanol steam reforming for hydrogen production. In both reports, higher conversion efficiency has been reported compared to current study using Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite catalyst. The lower conversion efficiency in current study compared to previously reported values is probably due to different operating parameters. Furthermore, MMT is a green and environment friendly materials with relatively low cost, good metal dispersion and improved stability [54]. It can be explored further by combining with supports (e.g., SBA-15, ZrO2) to get improved activity at reduced cost in ethanol steam reforming process for hydrogen production. Besides screening the catalysts performance on the basis of ethanol conversion and H2 yield, product selectivity was also evaluated. H2 and CO2 selectivity were almost constant for both homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction conditions as depicted in Fig. 5 (a). This could be attributed to the temperature dependent nature of ethanol steam reforming. At low temperatures, below 350°C, reactions such as ethanol dehydrogenation, aldehyde decomposition and methanation dominate. However, at the given temperature of 500°C, ESR and coke formation are most effective [67]. From Fig. 5(b), on addition of MMT to Ni/TiO2 micro-particles, selectivity of valuable CH4 increased significantly while that towards CO dropped marginally. The drop in both H2 and CO selectivity may be due to promotion of the methanation reaction (Eq. (3)), which converts both CO and H2 [68]. (3) CO + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + H 2 O Methanation reaction is an endothermic reaction and thus is favored by the high temperature. Furthermore, MMT addition could have altered selectivity with preference towards methane formation. 12% Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite exhibited higher selectivity for all products analyzed as compared to 12% Ni/TiO2 NPs. This demonstrated that both MMT addition and modification of particle size to nano-structure influenced the activity of the catalyst. Hence, a nano-composite catalyst composed of 12% Ni/20% MMT-TiO2 was adjudged to be of optimum formulation and structure."
10,Effect of operating parameters on catalytic activity and selectivity,"3.3 Effect of operating parameters on catalytic activity and selectivity In almost all the cases reported in literature with regard to ethanol steam reforming to H2, the catalysts are reduced in hydrogen before reforming reaction. This treatment at high temperatures could lead to sintering of Ni and consequently increase the tendency to carbon formation. In this study, the Ni/MMT-TiO2 catalyst was further used without reduction with hydrogen to investigate the effect of process parameters, namely operating temperatures, feed molar ratio and space time. 3.3.1 Effect of temperature ESR was carried out over Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite at 300°C, 400°C and 500°C. The conversion of ethanol and product yield at different temperatures and at a feed molar ratio (S/E=10:1) was compared and the results are presented in Table 4 . Ethanol conversion was very low at 300°C but increased progressively with the increase in temperatures, reaching a high of 88.85% at 500°C. These results agree well with previously reported work [8,9,69]. These observations have confirmed that ESR is an endothermic reaction, thus favored at high temperatures. High ethanol conversion at 500°C is further supported by the comparative high yields of both H2 and CO2. Compounds such as C2H4 and C2H6 had higher yields than CH4, CO and CO2 at temperatures below 500°C. This occurrence can be attributed to side reactions such as ethanol dehydration (Eq. (4)), which is exothermic and thus favored by lower temperatures. Thermodynamically probable compounds such as CH3COOH, CH3CHO, C2H5OC2H5 and CH3COCH3 were not detected, most likely because they could have been undergoing rapid reforming upon formation. The concentration of CO increased monotonously as expected, from the water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction (Eq. (5)), shift in equilibrium to the left, with the increased in temperature. (4) C 2 H 5 OH ↔ C 2 H 4 + H 2 O (5) CO+H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 At 500°C, ethanol approached full conversion while C2H4 and C2H6 species disappeared, probably since the C2 intermediates were decomposed into fragments desorbing as H2, CO and CH4. This study achieved a high ethanol conversion for the Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite catalyst at 500°C. Consequently, the increase in ethanol conversion resulted in a H2 yield of 54.54%. While ethanol steam reforming is an endothermic reaction, both the high conversion and yield could be attributed to the increase in temperature in addition of high activity of the catalyst. While H2 yield increased, selectivity dropped with an increase in temperature as shown in Fig. 6 . This can be attributed to the fact that, besides high temperatures favouring the main ESR reaction, other side reactions such as acetaldehyde decomposition (Eq. (6)) and methanation/reverse water gas shift reaction (Eq. (7)), which are endothermic, were also promoted. (6) CH 3 CHO ↔ CH 4 + CO (7) CO 2 + 4 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O Both these reactions result in production of valuable CH4 but in acetaldehyde decomposition, CO is also formed. CO formation at increasing temperatures is further emphasized by evaluating the CO2/COx ratio. At 400°C, CO2 dominates but CO starts to form with increasing temperature. At 500°C, CO2/CO=9:1, showing the commencement of CO formation. Therefore, it can be concluded that lower temperature is favourable for higher H2 selectivity, yet higher temperature promoted ethanol conversion. 3.3.2 Effect of feed molar ratio (S/E) Fig. 7 shows ethanol conversion, H2 selectivity and product yield as a functions of feed molar ratio. From Fig. 7(a), it can be observed that ethanol conversion decreases with an increase in feed molar ratio. This indicates that water is preferentially adsorbed on the catalyst. In other words, water competes with ethanol for similar “active sites” on the catalyst surface. The presence of large amounts of water at high S/E feed molar ratio (10:1) hinders the adsorption of ethanol, while shifting the equilibrium for ethanol dehydrative coupling reaction to the left, hence decreasing the ethanol conversion. Ethanol dehydrative coupling, an endothermic reaction (Eq. (8)), is plausible, feasible and favored at 500°C. (8) C 2 H 5 OH ↔ 1 / 2 C 2 H 5 OC 2 H 5 + 1 / 2 H 2 O While high feed molar ratios were synonymous with lower ethanol conversion, the high amount of water and low amount of ethanol favored H2 selectivity and results are presented in Fig. 7(b). H2 selectivity is mainly affected by the increase in production of side products. Lowering the S/E feed molar ratio from 10:1 to 1:10 resulted in an approximate 50% drop in H2 selectivity. This can be attributed to the fact that an increase of ethanol fraction in feed composition at 500°C promotes endothermic side reaction of ethanol decomposition (Eq. (9)), which promotes yields of side products CH4 and CO, thus reducing overall H2 selectivity. Water inhibits the ethanol decomposition reaction by channeling ethanol reactivity towards the main ESR reaction. This point is supported by the high CO2/COx ratio (≈0.9) at high S/E (10:1) feed molar ratio. CO2 dominates at high S/E ratio (10:1) while CO dominates at low S/E feed molar ratio (1:10) [70]. (9) C 2 H 5 OH ↔ CO+CH 4 + H 2 Fig. 7(c) shows the yield of significant products; H2, CO2, CH4, and CO in relation to the feed molar ratio. H2 and CO2 yield progressively decreased as the feed molar ratio (S/E) was reduced from 10:1 to 1:10. However, yield of valuable CH4 and undesirable CO increased. This observation can be linked to the promotion of methanation and ethanol decomposition reactions by higher ethanol fraction in feed. It further demonstrates that the high ethanol conversion exhibited by low feed molar ratio (S/E=1:10) did not translate to higher H2 yield but resulted in production of more CH4 and CO. 3.3.3 Effect of space time In order to investigate the influence of space-time (W/F) on the conversion of ethanol and products distribution, catalytic tests were performed in the space time range of 1.639–8.197kg catalyst h/kmol EtOH fed at 500°C with a S/E feed molar ratio of 10:1. As seen in Fig. 8 , the products selectivity of CO, CH4 and CO2 are close, indicating the simultaneous occurrence of ethanol decomposition and WGS reactions. However, it can be noted that selectivity of all products is minimally affected by changes in space-time. This can be attributed to contact time between reactants and active sites of catalysts. High contact times would result in high ethanol conversions and subsequent promotion of all plausible and feasible reactions and vice versa. An increase in space-time from 1.639 to 4.098kg catalyst h/ kmol EtOH fed resulted in increased H2 yield. This is due to the fact that enough contact time allowed for conversion of both reactants and intermediate products into H2. All products yield except CO2 tended to reach a maximum after which yield is no longer affected by increase in space-time. For CO2, yield dropped when the space-time was increased from 4.098 to 8.197kg catalyst h/ kmol EtOH fed. This could be an indication that the reverse water-gas-shift reaction was not only dictated by temperature, but the equilibrium shift was also favored by low contact time."
11,Characterization of spent catalysts,"3.4 Characterization of spent catalysts To examine possible carbon deposition and catalyst particles structural changes during ethanol steam reforming, post-reaction characterization of 12% Ni/20% MMT-TiO2 nano-composite catalyst sample was performed. Fig. 9 shows the FTIR spectra obtained for two different catalyst specimens; fresh and used catalysts. Clearly, the samples exhibited almost parallel spectra features, indicating similarity in the surface chemical composition of both samples. This confirmed that the spent sample had only mild carbon residue. Peak at 3631cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl OH bond, which is probably due to the fact that the spectra were recorded in situ and some re-adsorption of water from the ambient atmosphere has occurred [71]. Peak observed at 1640cm−1 corresponds to the CO vibrations [72]. The sharp peak at 1042cm−1 and the peak observed at 918cm−1 may be related to hydroxyl (bending) groups of molecular water [73]. Small peaks observed as the curve tends towards 550cm−1 correspond to Ti-O vibrations. No evidence about the type of carbon presented over the Ni/MMT-TiO2 composite detected in FTIR analysis. TGA curves for fresh catalyst sample are shown in Fig. 10 (a). The degradation has occurred in three steps. The first degradation from 50 to 150°C is attributed to the removal of water from the surface (weight loss of about 1%). The second degradation is from 500 to 700°C with ∼0.75weight loss%, due to dehydration and removal of organic residues. The third degradation occurs beyond 900°C. Total weight loss for the calcined catalyst was approximately 2.5%. Similarly, for the reduced sample in Fig. 10(b), it can be observed that the sample experiences an overall weight loss of around 12% from 50 to 1000°C. Low weight loss is an indicator of the thermal stability for the catalyst. However, the comparative extensive weight loss and exothermicity is indicative of loss of carbon from the catalyst surface at temperatures above 500°C. However, both samples show single peaks for the% carbon curve. The single peak is indicative of only one species of carbon being formed on the surface. Furthermore, the carbon peak for the reduced sample is sharper and steeper, occurring at temperatures above 700°C, illustrating formation of a more stable carbon species after the reaction in the spent catalyst. Fig. 11 shows the SEM micrographs of spent Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite catalyst. The micrographs in Fig. 11(a and b) suggestive of coke deposition over the catalyst surface due to alteration of shape. The presence of MMT, TiO2 and carbon species could be seen in both the images, yet less coke was deposited over the MMT surface compared to TiO2. This revealed, MMT hindered coke formation during ESR reaction and provides stability to catalyst. Fig. 11(c) shows the presence of coke over the support structure, evidencing the in particular the presence of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) during ESR reaction for hydrogen production. This confirms that main coking mechanism is the formation of CNTs. Similar observation has been reported previously [66]. However, the deactivation was not so severe indicating that an important Ni fraction remained exposed at the reactive mixture on the top of filaments and the carbon species which were not in contact with metallic particles were partially removed by gasification or reversed Boudouard reaction in Eq. (10) [37]. (10) C+CO 2 ↔ 2 CO Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) analysis of reduced catalyst at 500°C shows peaks for Ti, O, C, Ni and Al with Fe as the only impurity within the detection limit as presented in Fig. 11(d). Si and Al are both constituents of montmorillonite (Al2O3·4(SiO2) H2O). The effectiveness of MMT is the formation of layers on the TiO2 support that create sites for active Ni deposition. Hence, the presence of these species can be a further verification of MMT structure. The occurrence of C-species could be attributed to accumulation of coke in the form of CNTs, which may be due to ethanol dehydration to ethylene, polymerizing at low temperature if not efficiently gasified as explained in Eq. (11). (11) C 2 H 4 → polymers → 2 C + 2 H 2"
12,Catalyst stability tests,"3.5 Catalyst stability tests The development of stable catalyst is one of the most important issues in the production of H2 from steam reforming of ethanol, particularly since there is no oxygen (partial oxidation) available to remove carbon deposits that are detrimental to the catalytic stability. Results of stability test for ethanol conversion, H2 selectivity and yield are shown in Fig. 12 (a). H2 selectivity approached steady state before both ethanol conversion and H2 yield because of its temperature dependent nature in ESR. Over 20h of reaction time, minimal variations in overall activity were observed while high values were maintained. Ethanol conversion, H2 selectivity and yield were at an average of 88, 62 and 55% respectively. Furthermore, during time on stream, the curves for conversion and yield rate take longer time to stabilize (reached to equilibrium), probably due to using low temperature and because of specific characteristics of catalysts. Similar observations have been reported previously [65]. Comparatively, when Ni/MMT-TiO2 micro-particles and Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite catalysts were kept on stream at 500°C, the micro-particles sample showed depreciating activity after four hours. The depreciating activity was accompanied by pressure build up in the reactor, suggesting significant carbon deposition over this catalyst. The nano-composite catalyst on the other hand showed no activity loss over 20h of reaction, while attaining a near steady state condition after 3h, as shown in Fig. 12(b). These results supports the findings that over the Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite catalyst, ethylene is not formed at 500°C and thus, the ethylene polymerization reaction that contributes to coke formation, does not occur. Furthermore, since Ni-based catalysts are known to experience coke deposition and sintering, minimal coke formation in this catalyst can be attributed to the influence of MMT in improving dispersion of active Ni species on catalyst surface."
13,Conclusions,"The performance of a mono-metallic nano-structured catalytic system, based on Ni (12%) and supported on MMT (20%) and TiO2, were investigated for ethanol steam reforming at atmospheric pressure and from 300 to 500°C. The Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite catalyst revealed a good ability in the CC bond rapture of the ethanol molecule. This can be ascribed to the well-known function of nickel, which is directly available on the catalyst surface, enhanced by improved dispersion due to MMT addition to TiO2 nano-particles. The nano-scale particle size of the support leads to superior activity for ethanol dehydration due to a combination of factors, including; increased reducibility, improved metal dispersion and an increased abundance of redox sites on the catalyst surface. Hydrogen is the principle product at all temperatures, feed molar ratios and space-time. Furthermore, high ethanol conversion, H2 selectivity and yield are favored at high temperature due to a combination of ethanol decomposition, ethanol dehydration and ESR reactions. There is significant carbon deposition (CNTs) as indicated by TGA results and EDX analysis, but this has little effect on catalyst activity over 20h of reaction time. The high S/E feed molar ratio (10:1) contributes more of H and O rather than C element, hence minimizing coke formation. In general, the catalyst sample demonstrated promising results for activity, selectivity and appreciable stability."
