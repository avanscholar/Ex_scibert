0,Introduction,"Reactions of propargyl alcohols HCCC(OH)RR' with transition metal complexes are of interest because of their relevance to catalysis and organometallic synthesis. In the area of rhenium chemistry, reactions of propargyl alcohols have been reported for several hydride-free d6 rhenium(I) complexes including Re(OTf)(CO)2(triphos) (triphos = MeC(CH2PPh2)3) [1–11], ReCl(CO)2{12[ane]P3 iBu3}/CF3SO3Ag (12[ane]P 3 iBu3 = the macrocyclic phosphine ligand 1,5,9-tri(isobutyl)-1,5,9-triphosphacyclododecane) [12], [Re(CO)2(P)3]+ (P = PPh(OEt)2, PPh2OEt) [13], [CpRe(NO)(PPh3)(CH2Cl2)]BF4 [14], trans-ReCl(N2)(dppe)2 [15] and [Re(dppm)3]I [16,17]. The reactions often give interesting organometallic compounds such as hydroxyvinylidenes or allenylidenes or their derivatives, depending on the propargyl alcohol substituents as well as reaction conditions. For example, Peruzzini and his coworkers have shown that the reactions of Re(OTf)(CO)2(triphos) (Re-1) with HCCC(OH)Ph(R) (R = Me, Ph, p-C6H4NO2) give the allenylidene complexes [Re{=CC = CPh(R)}(CO)2(triphos)]OTf (Re-2, Scheme 1 ) [1,4], the reaction with 1-ethynyl-1-cyclohexanol gives the hydroxyvinylidene complex [Re{=C=CH(c-C6H10OH)}(CO)2(triphos)]OTf (Re-3) [3], the reaction with HCCC(OH)Me2 gives the dinuclear vinylidene-carbene complex [{(triphos)(CO)2Re}2{μ-(C10H12)}](OTf)2 (Re-5) [4], while the reaction with the secondary propargyl alcohol HCCC(OH)H(Me) in the presence of MeOH gives the methoxyalkenyl Fischer-type carbene complex [Re{C(OMe)CH=CHMe}(CO)2(triphos)]OTf (Re-4) [4]. Rhenium forms a large number of hydride/dihydrogen complexes with the number of H atoms in the hydride or dihydrogen ligands ranging from 1 to 9. Their reactions with propargyl alcohols are appealing as they can potentially give products derived from reactions associated with the hydride functionality. However, such reactions have rarely been investigated, although reactions of rhenium hydride complexes with terminal alkynes (HCCR) [18–20] and reactions of propargyl alcohols with hydrides of other metals (e.g. osmium [21]) are well-documented. As a rare example, Albertin et al reported that the complexes [Re(η 2-H2)(CO)2(P)3] (P = PPh(OEt)2, PPh2OEt) can react with HCC(OH)CPh2 at room temperature to give the allenylidene complexes [Re(=CC=CPh2)(CO)2P3]BF4 [12]. Rhenium carbyne complexes are potentially useful for catalysis, material science and organometallic synthesis [22]. In our efforts in developing synthetic methods for the synthesis of rhenium carbyne complexes, we have studied the reactions of ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 (1) with the propargyl alcohols HCCC(OH)Ph2 and HCCC(R)(OH)CCSiMe3 (R = CMe, adamantyl, iPr) in the presence of two equivalents of HCl [23–26]. The reactions were found to give a mixture of products including vinylcarbyne, γ -hydroxycarbyne and η 2-vinyl complexes. To extend the application of the chemistry, it is desirable to know how the substituents of propargyl alcohols might influence the selectivity of the products. To this end, we have recently studied the reactions of ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 (1) with several propargyl alcohols bearing substituents with different electronic and steric properties. Herein we report the results of this study."
1,Results and discussion,
2,"Reactions of ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 (1) with HCCC(OH)Ar2 (Ar = o-C6H4Br, o,o'-C6H3Cl2)","2.1 Reactions of ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 (1) with HCCC(OH)Ar2 (Ar = o-C6H4Br, o,o'-C6H3Cl2) We have previously reported that the reaction of HCCC(OH)Ph2 (2a) with ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 in the presence of HCl gave a mixture of the vinylcarbyne complex Re(≡CCH = CPh2)Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (3), the γ-hydroxycarbyne Re{≡CCH2C(OH)Ph2}Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (4) and the η2-vinyl complex Re{η2-CH2=CC(OH)Ph2}Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (5) in a molar ratio of 0.59:1:0.94 (Scheme 2 ) [22]. As a starting point to study the effect of substituents of propargyl alcohols on the pathways for the formation of vinylcarbyne, γ-hydroxycarbyne, and η2-vinyl complexes, we have carried out the reactions of ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 (1) with HCCC(OH)Ar2 (Ar = o-C6H4Br (2b), o,o'-C6H3Cl2 (2c)). Compared with HCCC(OH)Ph2, the aryl groups of 2b and 2c are sterically more demanding and electronically poorer. The propargyl alcohol HCCC(OH)(o-C6H4Br)2 (2b) bearing two aromatic rings with a bromo substituenet at the ortho position behaved differently compared with HCCC(OH)Ph2. As indicated by an in situ NMR experiment, HCCC(OH)(o-C6H4Br)2 reacted with 1 in the presence of HCl at room temperature to give the γ -hydroxycarbyne complex Re{≡CCH2C(OH)(o-C6H4Br)2}Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (6) as the major product (Scheme 3 ). Vinylcarbyne and η 2-vinyl complexes were either not produced or produced in an insignificant amount to be detectable by in situ NMR. The γ -hydroxycarbyne complex 6 can be isolated as a greenish-yellow solid in 82% yield with a preparative scale reaction. Similarly, the reaction of HCCC(OH)(o,o'-C6H3Cl2)2 (2c) with 1 in the presence of HCl produced the γ-hydroxycarbyne complex Re{≡CCH2C(OH)(o,o'-C6H3Cl2)2}Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (7). Again, vinylcarbyne and η2-vinyl complexes were also not detectable by in situ NMR experiments. The carbyne complexes 6 and 7 have been characterized by NMR, elemental analysis as well as X-ray diffraction. The molecular structures of 6 and 7 are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. The selected bond distances and angles are given in Table 1 . Both the complexes contain three meridionally bound PMe2Ph ligands, two mutually cis chloride ligands and a carbyne ligand trans to one of the chloride ligands. The Re≡C bond distances are 1.761(8) Å for 6 and 1.764(5) Å for 7; the Re-C(1)-C(2) angles are 172.6(6)° for 6 and 168.7(4)° for 7. The structural data are similar to those of complex 4 [22]. The solid state structures are supported by the solution NMR data. For example, the 13C{1H} NMR spectra show the carbyne signals at 267.2 ppm for 6 and 267.5 ppm for 7 and those of CH2 at 56.9 ppm for 6 and 61.0 ppm for 7. The results from the reactions of 1 with HCCC(OH)Ar2 (Ar = Ph, o-C6H4Br, o,o'-C6H3Cl2) indicate that presence of sterically demanding and electronically poor aryl groups at the C-OH carbon of propargyl alcohols disfavors the formation of η2-vinyl and vinylcarbyne complexes. Previous study on reactions of HCCAr with ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 reveals that, due to steric effect, an increase in the steric bulkiness of the aryl group Ar of HCCAr can increases the selectivity for the formation of carbyne complexes over that of η2-vinyl complexes.20 By analogy, the lack of η2-vinyl products in the reactions with HCCC(OH)Ar2 (Ar = o-C6H4Br, o,o'-C6H3Cl2) may also be attributed to steric effect, as will be described in more detail in the section dealing with the mechanism of the reactions. The lack of vinylcarbyne products in the reactions with HCCC(OH)Ar2 (Ar = Ph, o-C6H4Br, o,o'-C6H3Cl2) might be related to the electron withdrawing property of the aryl groups."
3,Reactions of 1 with HCCC(OH)Ph(CCSiMe3) and HCCC(OH)(CCSiMe3)2,"2.2 Reactions of 1 with HCCC(OH)Ph(CCSiMe3) and HCCC(OH)(CCSiMe3)2 To further study steric effect of substituents of propargyl alcohols, we have studied the reactions of 1 with HCCC(OH)Ph(CCSiMe3). As a CCSiMe3 group is sterically less demanding than a Ph group, formation of η2-vinyl complex might become more favorable for the reaction with HCCC(OH)Ph(CCSiMe3) compared with that with HCCC(OH)Ph2. The expectation has been confirmed experimentally. An in situ NMR experiment shows that the reaction of 1 with HCCC(OH)Ph(CCSiMe3) (2d) in the presence of HCl produced the vinylcarbyne complex ReCl2{≡CCH=C(Ph)(CCSiMe3)}(PMe2Ph)3 (8), the γ-hydroxycarbyne complex ReCl2{≡CCH2C(OH)Ph(CCSiMe3)}(PMe2Ph)3 (9), and the η2-vinyl complex ReCl2{η2-CH2=CC(OH)Ph(CCSiMe3)}(PMe2Ph)3 (10) in a molar ratio of 0.25:1:1.44 (Scheme 4 ). For comparison, the reaction with HCCC(OH)Ph2 (2a) gave the vinylcarbyne complex Re(≡CCH = CPh2)Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (3), the γ-hydroxycarbyne Re{≡CCH2C(OH)Ph2}Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (4) and the η 2-vinyl complex Re{η2-CH2 = CC(OH)Ph2}Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (5) in a molar ratio of 0.59:1:0.94 (Scheme 2). It was noted that γ -hydroxycarbyne complexes 4 and 9 do not evolve to the corresponding vinylcarbyne complexes on heating or treatment with HCl. Thus the vinylcarbyne complexes are not formed by dehydration of the γ -hydroxycarbyne complexes. The structures of complexes 8–10 can be readily assigned by their NMR data. In particular, the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum of 8 showed a doublet at −18.6 and a triplet at −28.3 ppm. The 1H NMR spectrum showed a characteristic Re≡CCH=C signal at 4.86 ppm. The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum of 9 showed a doublet at −20.3 and a triplet at –22.7 ppm. The 1H NMR spectrum showed a characteristic Re≡CCH2 signal at 2.65 ppm. The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum of 10 showed a triplet at −27.1 ppm, and two doublet of doublets at −29.0 and −31.4 ppm. The 1H NMR spectrum showed a characteristic Re(η2-CH 2C) signal at 2.37 ppm. These NMR data are similar to those of the analogous complexes 3, 4, and 5, respectively [22]. Further support to the expectation that propargyl alcohols with the sterically less demanding CCSiMe3 substituent favors the formation of η 2-vinyl complex comes from the reaction of 1 with HCCC(OH)(CCSiMe3)2 (2e). Treatment of 1 with 1.2 equivalents HCCC(OH)(CCSiMe3)2 (2e) in the presence of 2.2 equiv. of HCl produced a brown solution. An in situ NMR experiment shows that the reaction produced the η2-vinyl complex ReCl2{ η 2-CH2 = CC(OH)(CCSiMe3)2}(PMe2Ph)3 (11) as the only 31P{1H} NMR active product (Scheme 4). Neither the vinylcarbyne complex ReCl2{≡CCH = C(CCSiMe3)2}(PMe2Ph)3 nor the γ-hydroxycarbyne complex ReCl2{≡CCH2C(OH)(CCSiMe3)2}(PMe2Ph)3 was detected in the in situ NMR experiment. Pure sample of the η2-vinyl complex 11 can be obtained in 86% yield as purple crystals by recrystallization. Complex 11 has been characterized by NMR, elemental analysis as well as X-ray diffraction. The molecular structure of 11 is shown in Fig. 3 . The complex 11 contains three meridionally bound PMe2Ph ligands, two mutually cis chloride ligands and a η2-vinyl ligand trans to one of the chloride ligands. The Re=C and Re-C bond distances are 1.890(5) Å and 2.176(5) Å, respectively. The C(1)-Re-C(2), Re-C(1)-C(2), Re-C(2)-C(1) and Re-C(2)-C(3) angles are 39.81(19)°, 59.1(3)°, 81.1(3)° and 150.6(4)°, respectively. Consistent with the solid state structure, the 13C{1H} NMR spectrum of 11 shows the Re=C signal at 248.1 ppm and that of Re-CH2 at 12.5 ppm. The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum shows a triplet at −26.6 ppm and a doublet at −31.8 ppm with a coupling constant of 17.3 Hz. The η2-vinyl complexes 10–11 are interesting as well characterized rhenium η2-vinyl complexes are still rare. Reported examples of rhenium η2-vinyl complexes include trans-[ReCl(η2-CH2=CCH2Ph)(dppe)2]BF4 generated by the protonation of the allene complex trans-ReCl(η2-PhCH =C=CH2)(dppe)2 with HBF4 [27], CpReBr(η 2-CHPh = CPh)(PPh3) generated by addition of H- to the alkyne complex [CpReBr(η 2-PhCCPh)(PPh3)]PF6 [28], and [Cp*Re(CO)2(η2-RCH=CR)]BF4 (R = Ph, Me) generated by protonation of Cp*Re(CO)2(RCCR) with HBF4 [29]."
4,The reaction of 1 with HCCC(OH)Me2,"2.3 The reaction of 1 with HCCC(OH)Me2 To further study the influence of the substituents at the C-OH carbon atom of the propargyl alcohols on the formation of vinylcarbyne, γ -hydroxycarbyne, and η2-vinyl complexes in our system, we have carried out the reactions of 1 with HCCC(OH)Me2. In situ NMR experiments show that the reaction of 1 with HCCC(OH)Me2 produced the vinylcarbyne complex ReCl2(≡CCH=CMe2)(PMe2Ph)3 (12) only (Scheme 5 ). Neither the γ-hydroxycarbyne nor η2-vinyl complexes were detected in the in situ NMR experiment. It is noted that reaction of HCCC(OH)Ph2 (2a) gave the vinylcarbyne complex Re(≡CCH=CPh2)Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (3) and the γ-hydroxycarbyne Re{≡CCH2C(OH)Ph2}Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (4) in a molar ratio of 0.59:1. It appears that formation of vinylcarbyne complexes is more favorable for reactions of propargyl alcohols with an alkyl group than that with an aryl group. The reactions with HCCC(OH)(R)CCSiMe3 (R = CMe3, Ph) follows that same trend. The reaction of the alkyl substituted propargyl alcohol HCCC(OH)(CMe3)CCSiMe3 produced the corresponding vinylcarbyne and γ-hydroxycarbyne complexes in about 1:1 molar ratio [23], while that with the aryl substituted propargyl alcohol HCCC(OH)Ph(CCSiMe3) produced corresponding vinylcarbyne and γ -hydroxycarbyne complexes in a molar ratio of 0.25:1. The vinylcarbyne complex 12 has been characterized by NMR and elemental analysis. The structure of 12 has also been confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The molecular structure of 12 is shown in Fig. 4 . The selected bond distances and angles are given in Table 1. Complex 12 contains three meridionally bound PMe2Ph ligands, two mutually cis chloride ligands and a carbyne ligand trans to one of the chloride ligands. The Re≡C bond distance is 1.766(3) Å and Re-C(1)-C(2) angle is 176.6(3)°. The structural data are similar to those of complex 2. The solid state structure found for 12 is supported by the solution NMR data. The 13C{1H} NMR spectrum shows the carbyne signal at 261.7 ppm and that of CH=C at 134.9 ppm. The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum shows a triplet at −26.2 ppm and a doublet at −17.6 ppm with a coupling constant of 12.6 Hz."
5,"Mechanism for the formation of hydroxycarbyne, vinylcarbyne and η2-vinyl complexes and comments on the experimental observations","2.4 Mechanism for the formation of hydroxycarbyne, vinylcarbyne and η2-vinyl complexes and comments on the experimental observations Scheme 6 shows a plausible general mechanism for the formation of the γ -hydroxycarbyne complex Re{≡CCH2C(OH)R'2}Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (G), the vinylcarbyne complex Re(≡CCH = CR'2)Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (H) and the η2-vinyl complexes Re{η2-CH2=CC(OH)R'2}Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (I) from the reaction of 1 with propargyl alcohol HCCC(OH)R'2. Protonation of 1 with HCl may initially give the cationic hexahydride A which can lose two molecules of H2 to give the neutral unsaturated hydride complex B. The hydride complex B can then react with a molecule of HCCC(OH)R'2 to give the η 2-alkyne complex C1 or C2, which are isomers arising from different orientations of the alkyne. The complex C1 can undergo an insertion reaction by transferring the hydride to the internal carbon of the alkyne to give the vinyl complex D, which can evolve to the vinylidene complex E via α-hydrogen elimination [30,31]. Protonation of E with HCl at the β-carbon followed by elimination of H2 would give the γ-hydroxycarbyne complex G. Protonation of E with HCl at the oxygen of the OH group followed by elimination of H2 and H2O would give the vinylcarbyne complex H. Intermediate C2 could undergo an insertion reaction by transferring the hydride to the terminal carbon of the alkyne to give the η2-vinyl complex F. Protonation of F with HCl followed by loss of a molecule of H2 would give the η2-vinyl complex I. Protonation of vinylidene complexes to give carbyne complexes [32] and electrophilic abstraction of the OH group of hydroxyvinylidene complexes to give vinylcarbyne complexes [33] are well documented reactions. The proposed pathways for the formation of γ -hydroxycarbyne complex G and the η2-vinyl complex I are analogous to those previously proposed for the formation of carbyne complexes Re(≡CCH2Ar)Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (an analog of complex G) and η 2-vinyl complexes Re(η2-CH2=CAr)Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 (an analog of complex I) from the reaction of 1 with terminal arylalkynes HCCAr in the presence of HCl, which have been studied computationally [19]. The computational study on the reactions with HCCAr reveals that the selectivity for the carbyne and η2-vinyl complexes is kinetically controlled and is related to the relative stability of the η2-alkyne complex intermediates analogous to C1 and C2. We observed experimentally that the relative amounts of carbyne complexes and η2-vinyl complexes are strongly dependent on the steric properties of substituents of propargyl alcohols. The presence of sterically demanding groups at the C-OH carbon disfavors the formation of η2-vinyl complexes. For example, the reaction of HCCC(OH)(CCSiMe3)2 produced only the η2-vinyl complex, the reaction of HCCC(OH)Ph2 produced a mixture of carbyne and η2-vinyl complexes while the reactions of HCCC(OH)Ar2 (Ar = o-C6H4Br or o,o'-C6H3Cl2) produced only carbyne complexes. The observed trend in the selectivity for carbyne and η2-vinyl complexes could be related to the relative stability of the intermediates C1 and C2, which can be influenced by the steric properties of the substituents. According to the mechanism shown in Scheme 6, η2-vinyl complexes are derived from the insertion reactions of propargyl alcohols into the Re-H of intermediate C2, while carbyne complexes are derived from insertion reactions of propargyl alcohols into the Re-H of the intermediate C1. In the presence of sterically demanding substituents, intermediate C2 is expected to be less favorable than intermediate C1 due to steric effect, making the formation of η2-vinyl complexes I to be less favorable than the formation of carbyne complexes G and H). We also noted that the relative amounts of vinylcarbyne and γ -hydroxycarbyne complexes are dependent on the electronic properties of the substituents. In general, the relative amount of vinylcarbyne complexes increases as substituent of propargyl alcohols become more electron donating. For example, the reactions of HCCC(OH)Ar2 (Ar = o-C6H4Br, o,o'-C6H3Cl2) only produced the γ -hydroxycarbyne complexes, the reaction of HCCC(OH)Ph2 produced a mixture of γ -hydroxycarbyne and vinylcarbyne complexes, while the reaction of HCCC(OH)Me2 produced only vinylcarbyne complex. The trend in the relative amounts of the hydroxycarbyne and vinylcarbyne complexes produced appears to be related to the basicity of the OH group, which can be influenced by the electronic properties of the substituents. According to mechanism shown in Scheme 6, vinylcarbyne complexes are derived from the protonation at the OH group of the intermediate E, while γ -hydroxycarbyne complexes are derived from protonation at β-carbon of the intermediate E. It is expected that protonation at the OH group of intermediate E will become easier if the OH group is more basic, leading to the production of a relatively larger amount of vinylcarbyne complexes. The basicity of OH group will be higher if the substituent is more electron donating. The relative electron donating ability of Me, Ph, and o,o'-C6H3Cl2 is the order of Me > Ph > o,o'-C6H3Cl2. The order is in line with the observed trend in the relative amount of vinylcarbyne complexes produced in the reactions of the corresponding propargyl alcohols with ReH5(PMe2Ph)3."
6,Summary,"Reactions of the rhenium polyhydride ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 with propargyl alcohols HCCC(OH)RR' in the presence of HCl can produce vinylcarbyne Re(≡CCH = CRR')Cl2(PMe2Ph)3, γ -hydroxycarbyne Re{≡CCH2C(OH)RR'}Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 or η2-vinyl Re{η2-CH2=CC(OH)RR'}Cl2(PMe2Ph)3 complexes or a mixture of these depending on the substituents on the C-OH carbon. The reaction with the bisalkyl substituted propargyl alcohol HCCC(OH)Me2 produced only a vinylcarbyne complex. The reaction with the bis-alkynyl substituted propargyl alcohol HCCC(OH)(CCSiMe3)2 produced only an η2-vinyl complex. The reactions with the bis(o-functionalized aryl) substituted propargyl alcohols HCCC(OH)Ar2 (Ar = o-C6H4Br, o,o'-C6H3Cl2) produced only hydroxycarbyne complexes. The reactions with the monoaryl substituted propargyl alcohol HCCC(OH)Ph(CCSiMe3) produced a mixture of vinylcarbyne, γ-hydroxycarbyne and η2-vinyl complexes. Formation of η2-vinyl complexes is favored over that carbyne complexes when the substituents are sterically less demanding. Formation of vinylcarbyne complexes is favored over γ -hydroxycarbyne complexes when the substituents are electron releasing."
7,Experimental section,"All manipulations were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques unless otherwise stated. Solvents were distilled under nitrogen from sodium benzophenone (hexane, ether), sodium (benzene), or calcium hydride (CH2Cl2). The starting material ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 (1) was prepared following the procedure described in the literature [34]. Propargyl alcohols were prepared from ethynylmagnesium bromide and related ketones following a procedure similar to that for the preparation of HCCC(OH)Ph2 [35]. All other reagents were used as purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Microanalyses were performed by M−H−W Laboratories (Phoenix, AZ). 1H, 13C{1H}, and 31P{1H} spectra were collected on a Bruker ARX-400 spectrometer (400 MHz). 1H and 13C NMR shifts are relative to TMS, and 31P chemical shifts relative to 85% H3PO4. For cases involving virtual coupling, the reported coupling constants were obtained assuming that the spectra are first order. Reaction of 1 with HC CC(OH)(o-C6H4Br)2.

The crystals of 6, 7, and 12 were grown from a dichloromethane solution layered with hexane at room temperature. The crystal of 11 was grown from a benzene solution layered with hexane using acetone as the transition layer at room temperature. The diffraction intensity data of 6 were collected with an Oxford Diffraction Gemini™ S Ultra X-ray Diffractometer with monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) at 173 K. Lattice determination, data collection and reduction were carried out using CrysAlisPro 171.33.46. Absorption correction was performed using built-in SADABS program the CrysAlisPro program suite. The diffraction intensity data of 7, 11, and 12 were collected with a Bruker Smart APEX CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kαradiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 100 K. Lattice determination and data collection were carried out using SMART v.5.625 software. Data reduction and absorption correction by empirical methods were performed using SAINT v 6.26 and SADABS v 2.03, respectively. Structure solution and refinement for all compounds were performed using the Olex2 software [36] package (which embedded SHELXTL [37]). All the structures were solved by direct methods, expanded by difference Fourier syntheses and refined by full matrix least-squares on F2. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically with a riding model for the hydrogen atoms except noted separately.
