0,Introduction,"Now a day’s production of clean hydrogen energy has gain significant importance because of increasing consumption of energy and decrease in the amount of existed other energy sources like coal, oil and natural gases. Electrolysis in alkaline water is promising technique for production of hydrogen through evolution reaction. The challenges associated with this technique are the increasing efficiency, safety and reducing cost of production compare to the other techniques like exchange of proton through membrane in water electrolysis and high temperature steam in water electrolysis [1–4]. To overcome these problems it is important to design catalysts with highly active surface towards hydrogen evolution reaction which could be characterized by the hydrogen bonding energy at the surface of the catalyst. Ni is one of the promising non-novel metals having highest current exchange density to hydrogen evolution reaction but it’s HER activities limited by the hydrogen desorption on the surface. Many researchers have found the increase in the hydrogen bonding energy on the nickel catalytic surface which limits it’s HER activity. Therefore, to further improve activity of the Ni surface towards hydrogen evolution reaction it is necessary to decrease the hydrogen bonding energy. In recent times Ni-based alloys catalysts have been explored for obtaining high catalytic activity through electrolysis in alkaline water [5]. There are several approaches to modify the hydrogen bonding energy on the metal catalytic surface by modifying orientation of the crystal [6], geometrical structure of the crystal [7] and forming alloys with other materials [8,9]. In one of the previous study, Ni catalyst has found the highest catalyst activities for its 〈111〉 crystal orientation obtained from the electro-deposition conditions [6]. In another study, effect of alloying element on hydrogen bonding energy with catalytic surfaces has been investigated using computational method based on density function theory [5]. The suggestive metals for the alloying with Ni are Ag, Cd, Au, Bi, Ru and Cu to enhance the HER by decreasing the hydrogen bonding energy with the catalytic surface. But Cu is most suitable for the alloying with Ni because of its low cost, high corrosion resistance, environment friendly and also forms isomorphous solid solution with Ni because of almost equal lattice parameter [10,11]. Nanocrystalline Ni-Cu alloy catalysts can be prepared using various methods like vapor deposition, electrode-deposition, magnetron sputtering, melt-spinning, and mechanical alloying [12,13]. But, in the case of magnetron sputtering, as-deposited alloys purity can be most effectively controlled using highly pure elemental targets as well as gases used for sputtering. Moreover, microstructure and grain size of the magnetron sputter-deposited alloy films can be easily controlled by regulating the process parameters like target power, substrate bias, substrate temperature, and gas pressure [14,15]. Ni-Cu alloy thin films have been investigated so far for potential applications in resistive and thermoelectric devices or MEMS [11,16,17]. There are possibilities of excellent activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction of the Ni-Cu alloys, and therefore this phenomenon deserves to be examined. In present investigation, deposition of Ni-Cu alloy catalyst of various compositions have been done by magnetron co-sputtering of Ni and Cu used as target materials in Ar gas environment and its HER activities in alkaline water electrolysis have been evaluated and correlated with surface morphology and varying Cu concentration in NiCu alloy films."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,Processing,"2.1 Processing A DC magnetron co-sputtering system (KVS-T 4065, Korea Vacuum Tech., Gyeonggi-do, South Korea), fitted out with two targets was used for the sputter deposition of Ni-Cu alloys. The sputtering chamber was first evacuated to a base pressure of around 3 × 10−4 Torr using a rotary pump and further to a base pressure of around 2 × 10−6 Torr using a turbo-molecular pump. For co-sputter deposition of NiCu alloys, 99.9% pure Ni and Cu targets were engaged simultaneously as DC power sources. Further, 99.99% pure Ar gas with constant flow rate of around 50 sccm was used for sputtering of Ni and Cu targets. The Ni-Cu alloys were deposited on ultrasonically cleaned (with acetone and alcohol) p-type Si (100) substrates. To remove the oxides present of the target surface pre-sputtering for about 5 min were done which ensure the purity of the deposited alloys. Further the uniformity in thickness of the all deposited NiCu alloys were maintained by rotating the substrate at 25 rpm. The process parameters have been used for formation of the Ni-Cu alloys are shown in Table 1 ."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization A contact-type surface profilometer (Dektak150 surface profiler, Veeco Instruments, Plainview, NY, USA) was used to measure the thickness of the as-deposited NiCu alloy catalysts. This profilometer was fitted out with a diamond tip stylus having diameter of 12.5 μm, operated with a force of 3 mgf. A grazing incidence X-ray diffractometer (Philips X’Pert PRO Diffractometer, PANalytical, Almelo) was used for phase analysis of the as-deposited Ni-Cu alloys. The operating voltage and current of this diffractometer were maintained at 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. Further X-ray diffraction scans were completed using Cu Kα radiation with wavelength equal to 0.1540 nm in the range between 40° and 60° with scan rate 0.05°/s, while scan angle of incidence between specimen plane and incident X-rays was kept at 1.5°. A field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH, Model: Zeiss SUPRA 40) was used to examine the microstructures of Ni-Cu alloys and pure Ni. The operating voltage for FESEM was kept at 20 kV for all microstructural analysis. Both secondary electron (SE) and back scattered electron (BSE) imaging modes were used to capture the microstructures for analysis. During microstructural studies, atomic percentage of Ni and Cu present in the NiCu alloys were measured using an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) micro-analyzer attached along with the same FESEM. Moreover, EDX mapping were done in order to identify the Ni and Cu enrichment in the investigated NiCu alloys. For in depth microstructural and elemental analysis, a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM 2100, JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) were used which operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. For this purpose, cross-sectional TEM samples were prepared using mechanical thinner with a dimpler (Model 656, Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA), followed by argon ion-milling (Precision Ion Polishing system, Model 691, Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA). Both bright field and dark field modes were used for analysis of microstructures of NiCu alloy catalysts by TEM, while selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern were used to identify the phases present in the NiCu alloys. Combined with imaging, chemical analysis of the NiCu alloys was carried out using an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalyzer. The cyclic voltammetry was used to observe the activities of NiCu alloy catalysts toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. The cyclic voltammetry analysis was done in the 6 M KOH solution at room temperature using Autolab PG Stat-30 (Potentiostat/Galvanostat). The variation of applied potential was in the range of −1.0 V to −1.7 V with scan rate of 50 mV/s."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Elemental and microstructural analysis,"3.1 Elemental and microstructural analysis The chemical compositions of the matrix in the Ni100-xCux thin films as determined by EDX analysis are x = 28, 37, 48 and 59. These are average compositions obtained on EDX analysis of at least 5 locations in the microstructure. The compositions of the matrix have been further confirmed by comparison with Ni:Cu ratios achieved through the Ni and Cu deposition rates, as shown in Table 2 . The XRD patterns of the as-deposited NiCu alloys with different composition are shown in Fig. 1 . The XRD peaks shows 〈111〉 orientation is the preferred orientation for all DC magnetron sputtered NiCu alloys. A progressive shift in the peak positions of Ni towards the lower 2θ angle is suggestive of increase in lattice constant due to the formation of NiCu alloys, as shown in Fig. 1. The values of lattice constant measured from the positions of the {111} XRD peaks have been plotted with respect to Cu concentration, as shown in Fig. 2 . It shows that the lattice constant (a0) increases with Cu content (CCu) of the Ni-Cu alloy films following a linear relationship obtained by regressional analysis: (1) a 0 = 0.3521 + 5.5561 ∗ C Cu ( at % ) where CCu is the concentration of Cu. The linear relationship between a0 and CCu with R2 = 0.94 as illustrated in Fig. 2 is consistent with the predictions of the Vegard’s law. The observed increase in lattice constant of Ni-Cu alloy with increase in Cu concentration may be due to bigger size of Cu atom compare to Ni as atomic radius of Cu is 0.128 nm and Ni is 0.124 nm. The increase in lattice constant of the NiCu alloys with increase in Cu atomic percentage is consistent with predictions according to the Vegard’s law. The average grain sizes of the NiCu alloys calculated using Williamson-Hall relationship [18] are shown in Table 3 . These values of grain size are less than those found for pure Ni. However, the RMS strain value of the NiCu alloys has been found to be considerably higher than the value found for pure Ni film. The typical FESEM micrographs illustrating the microstructure of Ni, Ni72Cu28, Ni52Cu48, and Ni41Cu59 alloys grown at substrate bias of −60 V are shown in Fig. 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d), respectively. A careful observation of this image shows the formation the clusters of grains, and also microstructure of alloy films are appear to be finer and smother compare to pure Ni film. Bright field and corresponding dark field cross-section TEM micrographs depicting the microstructures of the Ni52Cu48 alloy and high resolution TEM image along with SAED pattern are shown in Fig. 4 (a), (b), (c) and (d), respectively. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the presence of nanometric grains of Ni-Cu alloy, which have sharp grain boundaries, as depicted in the high resolution TEM image [Fig. 4(c)]. The conforming selected area electron diffraction pattern [Fig. 4(d)] shows continuous rings indicating the existence of nano-sized grains and indexing of the these rings is consistent with the fcc lattice structure of Ni-Cu alloy. The selected area electron diffraction pattern also shows the prominent (111) ring which indicates 〈111〉 orientation as preferred orientation for NiCu alloy grains and this is supported by XRD results. The variation of grain size is found to be in the range of 8–12 nm obtained with measurement of around 200 grains sing by analyzing bright field and dark field cross-section TEM micrographs of the NiCu alloys."
6,Electrochemical analysis,"3.2 Electrochemical analysis The activities of the Ni, Cu, Ni72Cu28, Ni63Cu37, Ni52Cu48, and Ni41Cu59 alloys towards hydrogen evolution reactions for 50 cycles were analyzed using a cyclic voltammetry in a 6 M KOH electrolyte are shown in the Fig. 5 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f), respectively. It shows the variation of current density with the number of cycle for the Ni, Cu, Ni72Cu28, Ni63Cu37, Ni52Cu48, and Ni41Cu59 alloys. The highest current density corresponding to hydrogen evolution reaction has been observed for the Ni52Cu48 alloy [Fig. 5(e)] in its first cycle at room temperature and value of current density is found to decrease with the increase in number of cycle due to the decrease in active surface area of the catalytic surfaces because of hydrogen bubbles formation at the surface of NiCu alloy catalysts and after the tenth cycle constant current density has been achieved through the balancing between buoyance forces and surface tension [19–21]. It is also observed from cyclic voltammetry results [Fig. 5] that activity of Cu towards hydrogen evolution reaction is negligible compared to the pure Ni and NiCu alloys. Furthermore, the calculated values of exchange current density from Tofel plot corresponding to hydrogen evolution reaction for the Ni52Cu48 alloy is ≈1.6 × 10−3 mA/cm−2 which is higher than value of exchange current density for Ni in 5 M KOH (≈1.1 × 10−3 mA/cm−2) and in 1 M NaOH (≈1.3 × 10−3 mA/cm−2) [22,10]. The variation in current density corresponding to hydrogen evolution reaction with respect to number of cycle at −1.7 V for NiCu alloys with different composition and the pure Ni for comparison are shown in Fig. 6 . It shows the highest current density observed for pure Ni and NiCu alloys at its first cycle in the following order Ni52Cu48 > Ni63Cu37 > Ni72Cu28 > Ni41Cu59 > Ni. From the Fig. 6 it has also been observed that decay in the current density for the Ni72Cu28, Ni63Cu37 and Ni52Cu48 alloys catalysts are higher compare to the pure Ni. Fast decrease in current density may be because of the lower coverage and comparatively smoother surface of the NiCu alloy catalysts compare to pure Ni catalyst. And this is a good agreement with the effect of surface morphology on the hydrogen bubble formation [23,24]. Thus, NiCu alloys with almost equal atomic percentage can be utilized as catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction with high catalytic activities."
7,Conclusions,"The NiCu alloys have been successfully prepared by direct current magnetron co-sputtering of Ni and Cu elemental targets with preferred orientation of 〈111〉 and grain size variation of 8–12 nm, which shows the very good catalytic activities towards hydrogen evolution reaction in a 6 M KOH electrolyte. The highest current density for hydrogen evolution reaction has been observed for the Ni52Cu48 alloy at its first cycle and further decrease in current density is observed at higher cycle and after tenth cycle constant current density is achieved because of the balancing between surface tension and buoyance forces."
