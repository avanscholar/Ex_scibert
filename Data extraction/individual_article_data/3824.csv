0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has attracted much attention as a promising energy due to its clean, renewable, and non-polluting nature [1,2]. Many kinds of fuels, including natural gas, gasoline, alcohols, and gasified coal, have been used to produce hydrogen via catalytic reactions [3–14]. In particular, light alcohols have served as a promising fuel source for the production of hydrogen, because they can be easily handled and are widely distributed around the world. Although methanol has been commonly used as a hydrogen source in fuel cell applications, ethanol has advantages of low toxicity, high volumetric energy density, and availability [5–7]. Ethanol has been converted into hydrogen via several catalytic reactions, including steam reforming, partial oxidation, and auto-thermal reforming. Among these catalytic reaction technologies, auto-thermal reforming has been recognized as a feasible method to produce hydrogen from ethanol in terms of both heat management and oxygen utilization [8]. Metal oxide catalysts have been widely investigated in a series of fuel processing reactions, including reforming [9–14], water gas shift [15–17], and preferential CO oxidation [18,19]. In the oxidative steam reforming (auto-thermal reforming) of methanol over CuCoZnAl metal oxide catalysts, it was reported that an incorporation of Co decreased the hydrogen yield, whereas an incorporation of Cu increased the hydrogen yield [11]. In the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol over CuNiZnAl metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, it was revealed that a Cu-rich catalyst favored the dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, while the incorporation of Ni accelerated the C–C bond cleavage for the formation of CO, CO2, and CH4 [12,13]. A study on the catalytic activity and stability of NiO/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts in the steam reforming of ethanol also showed that a stable and highly active catalyst could be obtained by adjusting the Ni content and Ce:Zr ratio [14]. Thus, the identity and the composition of complex metal oxide catalysts play an important role in determining the catalytic performance in hydrogen production by either steam or auto-thermal reforming reaction. In this work, a series of Ni-Ti-Zr metal oxide catalysts with various Ti:Zr ratios was prepared by a one-step sol-gel method, and applied to hydrogen production by auto-thermal reforming of ethanol. The prepared catalysts were characterized by SEM-EDX, XRD, TPR, and XPS analyses to elucidate their catalytic performance. The effect of the Ti:Zr ratio on the catalytic performance of Ni-Ti-Zr metal oxides in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Ni-Ti-Zr metal oxide catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of Ni-Ti-Zr metal oxide catalysts A series of Ni-Ti-Zr metal oxides with various Ti:Zr ratios was prepared by a one-step sol-gel method. Known amounts of nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6 H2O, Sigma–Aldrich), zirconium butoxide (Zr(OBu)4, Sigma–Aldrich), and titanium butoxide (Ti(OBu)4, Sigma–Aldrich) were separately dissolved in 2-propanol (C3H8O, Sigma–Aldrich). A small amount of acetylacetone (C5H8O2, Sigma–Aldrich) was added to a solution containing zirconium precursor. Each solution containing a metal precursor was then mixed with vigorous stirring to form a single solution, and the pH of the resulting solution was adjusted at 9.0 by adding an appropriate amount of aqueous ammonia solution (30%, Sigma–Aldrich). After stirring the resulting slurry for 12h, it was dried at 80°C in a convection oven to obtain a solid. The solid product was finally calcined at 600°C for 5h to yield the Ni-Ti-Zr metal oxide. In the preparation of Ni-Ti-Zr metal oxide catalysts, the atomic ratio of nickel with respect to titanium+zirconium was fixed at 1.0, while that of titanium with respect to zirconium was varied from 0 to 5.0. The prepared Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x O15 (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) metal oxide catalysts were denoted as Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5)."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The chemical compositions of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts were determined by SEM-EDX (Jeol, JSM-6700F) analyses. The crystalline phases of the calcined and reduced catalysts were determined by XRD (MAC Science, M18XHF-SRA) measurements using Cu-Kα radiation (λ=1.54056Å) operated at 50kV and 100mA. In order to check the reducibility of the catalysts, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out in a conventional flow system with a moisture trap connected to a thermal conductivity detector at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000°C with a ramping rate of 5°C/min. For the TPR measurements, a mixed stream of H2 (2ml/min) and N2 (20ml/min) was used for 0.1g of catalyst sample. To investigate the electronic states of Ni species, XPS (ThermoVG, SIGMA PROBE) analyses were conducted for the reduced catalysts."
4,Auto-thermal reforming of ethanol,"2.3 Auto-thermal reforming of ethanol Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram for auto-thermal reforming of ethanol. The auto-thermal reforming of ethanol was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. Each calcined catalyst (50mg) was charged into a tubular quartz reactor surrounded by an insulated electric heater, and then it was reduced with a mixed stream of H2 (10ml/min) and N2 (30ml/min) at 600°C for 3h. Ethanol and water were sufficiently vaporized by passing through a pre-heating zone and continuously fed into the reactor together with a N2 carrier (30ml/min). Electric heating band was used for the pre-heating of ethanol and water. The feed ratios of H2O/EtOH and O2/EtOH were fixed at 3.0 and 0.5, respectively. The contact time was maintained at 175g-catalyst·min/EtOH-mol. All the gas flow rates were precisely controlled using mass flow controllers. The catalytic reaction was carried out at 500°C. The reactor temperature was kept constant using a temperature controller equipped with a thermocouple. The reaction products were periodically sampled and analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (Younglin, ACME 6000) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Ethanol conversion and product selectivity were calculated according to the following equations. Here, n represents the number of moles and χ is a stoichiometry factor (χ =2 for C1 and χ =1 for C2 compounds). (1) EtOH conversion= n EtOH,in − n EtOH,out n EtOH,in × 100 (2) H 2 selectivity = n H 2 3 ( n EtOH,in − n EtOH,out ) + ( n H 2 O,in − n H 2 O,out ) × 100 (3) C χ selectivity = n C χ χ ( n EtOH,in − n EtOH,out ) × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,"Formation and crystalline structure of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts","3.1 Formation and crystalline structure of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts The chemical compositions of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts determined by SEM-EDX analyses are listed in Table 1. The catalysts were calcined at 600°C for 5h prior to the SEM-EDX measurement. The composition of each metal component in Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) was in good agreement with the theoretical value, indicating the successful formation of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5). A preliminary experimental result revealed that Ni/TiO2 and Ni/ZrO2 catalysts showed a better catalytic performance than Ni/ZnO, Ni/MgO, and Ni/Al2O3 catalysts in hydrogen production by auto-thermal reforming of ethanol due to the enhanced reducibility of nickel species on TiO2 and ZrO2 support [20]. In this work, therefore, nickel, titanium, and zirconium were chosen as active components in the preparation of metal oxide catalysts. On the basis of a preliminary experimental result [20], the atomic ratio of nickel with respect to titanium+zirconium was fixed at 1.0 in the preparation of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts with an average nickel content of ca. 30wt%. On the other hand, the atomic ratio of titanium with respect to zirconium was varied to investigate the effect of the Ti:Zr ratio on the catalytic property and catalytic performance of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts calcined at 600°C for 5h. In the Ni5Zr5 catalyst, broad XRD peaks representing cubic ZrO2 (JCPDS 27-0997) were dominantly observed, and relatively weak peaks indicative of nickel oxide were also found. The intensities of the XRD peaks for nickel oxide continuously decreased with increasing titanium substitution, and finally, the XRD peaks corresponding to nickel oxide disappeared in the Ni5Ti5 catalyst. The XRD pattern of Ni5Ti5 catalyst was very similar to that of rhombohedral NiTiO3, indicating the formation of NiTiO3 during the calcination step. The rhombohedral NiTiO3 phase (JCPDS 33-0960) was not detected in the Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x catalysts with high zirconium content, while the cubic ZrO2 phase (JCPDS 27-0997) was not observed in the Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x catalysts with high titanium content. In other words, the growth of grain sizes of titanium and zirconium oxide species was inhibited by the presence of Zr4+ and Ti4+, respectively [21]. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts reduced at 600°C for 3h. Compared to the calcined catalysts (Fig. 2), all the Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts showed narrow XRD peaks for metallic nickel, indicating the formation of large nickel particles after the reduction. In the Ni5Zr5 catalyst, both cubic (JCPDS 27-0997) and monoclinic phases of ZrO2 (JCPDS 36-0420) were observed. However, the monoclinic phase of ZrO2 disappeared and the cubic phase of ZrO2 gradually decreased with increasing titanium substitution in the Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, and 4) catalysts. On the other hand, the tetragonal phase of TiO2 (JCPDS 21-1276) gradually developed with increasing titanium substitution in the Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts. The Ni5Ti5 catalyst showed the tetragonal phase of TiO2 and the metallic nickel, indicating that the NiTiO3 phase was transformed into the tetragonal phase of TiO2 and the metallic nickel during the reduction step. It is noteworthy that both the cubic phase of ZrO2 and the tetragonal phase of TiO2 were weakly observed in the Ni5Ti2.5Zr2.5 catalyst, suggesting that the development of titanium and zirconium oxide crystals was disturbed by the presence of Zr4+ and Ti4+, respectively, in the titanium–zirconium (1:1) binary metal oxide system [21]."
7,"Reducibility of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts","3.2 Reducibility of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts TPR measurements were carried out to investigate the reducibility of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts and to see the interaction between nickel and metal oxides. Fig. 4 shows the TPR profiles of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts. The peak areas for H2 uptake of the catalysts were almost the same. It is known that unsupported NiO is reduced at around 280°C [22,23]. However, no peaks related to the reduction of bulk NiO were found in the Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts. In the Ni5Zr5 catalyst, one reduction peak, attributed to the reduction of NiO interacting with ZrO2, appeared at around 600°C [24]. In the Ni5Ti5 catalyst, on the other hand, one major reduction peak with a shoulder was observed at around 650°C due to the reduction of NiTiO3 [23,25]. With increasing titanium substitution from x =1 to x =4, however, broad reduction peaks appeared within the temperature window of 450°C–700°C. It is believed that these reduction bands are attributed to the presence of nickel species with different oxidation states. Among the catalysts examined, the Ni5Ti1Zr4 catalyst showed the highest reducibility (Fig. 4). In order to verify the different oxidation states of nickel species, XPS analyses for Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts were conducted. The binding energies of Ni 2p3/2 in the Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts reduced at 600°C for 3h are summarized in Table 2. All the Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts showed three kinds of binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 at around 852.8eV, 854.0eV, and 856.0eV. In particular, the composition of the metallic nickel species appearing at around 852.8eV was decreased in the order of Ni5Ti1Zr4 >Ni5Ti2.5Zr2.5 >Ni5Ti4Zr1 >Ni5Zr5 >Ni5Ti5. This trend is in good agreement with the catalytic performance which will be described later. Apart from the binding energy for metallic nickel, all the catalysts showed two additional binding energies at around 854.0eV and 856.0eV. These values are not coincident with the binding energies for pure Ni0, Ni2+, and Ni3+ [26–29]. It is believed that these two additional binding energies may be due to different oxidation states of NiO x species interacting with metal oxide species such as ZrO2 and TiO2 through the formation of a Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x structure."
8,"Catalytic performance of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts","3.3 Catalytic performance of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts All the Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts tested in this work exhibited almost complete conversion of ethanol at 500°C, while the product distributions over the catalysts were different depending on the catalyst composition. Fig. 5 shows the hydrogen selectivity with time on stream in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol over Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts at 500°C. The catalytic performance was decreased in the order of Ni5Ti1Zr4 >Ni5Ti2.5Zr2.5 >Ni5Ti4Zr1 >Ni5Zr5 >Ni5Ti5, in good agreement with the trend of the composition of metallic nickel appearing at around 852.8eV (Table 2). It is believed that the binding energy of 852.8eV is closely associated with the metallic nickel species efficient for the reaction. It is noteworthy that the hydrogen selectivity over Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol at 500°C after a 15h-reaction showed a volcano-shaped curve with respect to titanium content, as shown in Fig. 6. This result indicates that an optimum ratio of Ti:Zr is required for the maximum selectivity of hydrogen through the formation of a Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x O15 catalyst with favorable crystalline and electronic structures. Ni5Zr5 showed slightly higher hydrogen selectivity than Ni5Ti5, which might be due to the role of ZrO2 in the activation of steam during the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol [30]. It is interesting to note that the three-component Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =1, 2.5, and 4) catalysts showed a better performance than the two-component catalysts (Ni5Zr5 and Ni5Ti5). As shown in the XRD patterns of reduced catalysts (Fig. 3), the crystalline phase of monoclinic ZrO2, which is known to be almost inactive in the activation of steam [31–33], was developed in the Ni5Zr5 catalyst, while no peak related to the monoclinic ZrO2 was observed in the three-component catalysts. It can be inferred that the ZrO2 phases in the three-component Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x catalysts are more effective for the activation of steam than those in the Ni5Zr5 catalyst, even though their contents were relatively low in the three-component Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x catalysts. Along with the water-activation effect of the ZrO2 phase, it is believed that the reducibility of nickel species also affected the catalytic performance. As evidenced by TPR and XPS analyses, active metallic nickel species were richer in the three-component catalysts than in the two-component catalysts. In particular, the Ni5Ti1Zr4 catalyst was found to have the highest content of metallic nickel species, among the catalysts tested. Therefore, it is concluded that high reducibility and the relatively large amount of effective phase of ZrO2 resulted in the highest catalytic performance of Ni5Ti1Zr4. Fig. 7 shows the by-product distribution over Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol at 500°C after a 15h-reaction. The selectivity for CO over Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts was ca. 5% with no great difference. The selectivity for C2 compounds was also found to be very low. However, the selectivity for CO2 and CH4, which were formed via the reaction of C2H5OH+H2O→CH4 +CO2 +2H2, was much higher than that for CO, C2H4, and CH3CHO. Furthermore, the selectivity for CO2 and CH4 over Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts showed a similar trend to that for hydrogen (Figs. 5 and 6), which showed a volcano-shaped curve with respect to titanium content."
9,Conclusions,"A series of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x (x =0, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5) catalysts was prepared by a one-step sol-gel method, and applied to hydrogen production by auto-thermal reforming of ethanol. The effect of the Ti:Zr ratio on the crystalline structure, electronic property, and catalytic performance of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x catalysts was investigated. The successful formation of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x catalysts was well confirmed by SEM-EDX analyses. The coexistence of titanium and zirconium favorably served to form metallic nickel (Ni0) species. The metallic nickel with a binding energy of ca. 852.8eV was closely related to the catalytic performance of Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x catalysts. In the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol, an optimum ratio of Ti:Zr was required for the maximum selectivity of hydrogen through the formation of a Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x catalyst with favorable crystalline and electronic structures. The hydrogen selectivity over Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x catalysts showed a volcano-shaped curve with respect to titanium substitution. Among the catalysts tested, Ni5Ti1Zr4 showed the best catalytic performance due to the highest reducibility combined with the water-activation ability of ZrO2. The selectivity for CO2 and CH4 over Ni5Ti x Zr5 − x catalysts also showed a volcano-shaped curve with respect to titanium substitution."
