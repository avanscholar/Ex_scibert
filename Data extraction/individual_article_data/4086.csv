0,Introduction,"Metal nanoparticles with smaller particle sizes (1–10 nm) are regarded as a new class of materials owing to their unique electronic, magnetic, and optical features [1]. Although they have been used as catalysts in various applications in last few years, they have to be stabilized against agglomeration in solution to exhibit higher catalytic activities. For this purpose, stabilizing ligands can be added into the solution to stabilize metal nanoparticles [2]. Metal nanoparticles stabilized against agglomeration by this way show higher catalytic activity, conductivity, magnetic and optical properties. On the other hand, these unique properties of metal nanoparticles can be further improved by the addition of another element. Especially, adding second/third metals to the monometallic counterparts, which are known as good catalysts, is one of the most common ways to enhance catalytic performances [3]. Over the last two decades, hydrogen is regarded as an outstanding energy carrier for today’s world needs especially heating, transportation, and electricity generation [4]. However, hydrogen storage is the most difficult obstacle to be overcome in the implementation of hydrogen economy concept which deals with the production, storage, distribution, and utilization of hydrogen [5]. Among the tested solid hydrogen storage materials, being as the simplest amine-borane compound, ammonia borane (H3NBH3, AB) has following advantages to be one of the most promising hydrogen storage materials: high hydrogen content (19.6 wt %) surpassing the targets set by US DOE, high solubility in water, and high stability of its aqueous solutions [6]. Hydrogen in ammonia borane can be released by thermolysis in solid state [7], dehydrocoupling in some non-aqueous solvents [8], or hydrolysis in the presence of suitable catalysts [9]. Among these methods, catalytic hydrolysis pathway of ammonia borane is the most favorable one for portable applications [10] since it provides the production of 3 mol of pure hydrogen gas in the presence of appropriate metal catalysts under mild conditions as shown in Eq. (1): (1) H 3 NBH 3 ( a q ) + 2 H 2 O ( l ) → catalyst NH 4 + ( a q ) + BO 2 - ( a q ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) . The first studies on the ammonia borane hydrolysis date back to 2006 reported by Xu et al. employing either noble [11] or non-noble [6a] metals as catalysts. After their studies, the number catalysts and articles tested in this hydrolysis reaction have been increasing very rapidly. Although catalysts containing noble metals have much greater catalytic activities to release hydrogen from ammonia borane, their high costs restrict their common employment. Therefore, development of low-cost catalysts containing either only non-noble metals or combination of noble and non-noble metals is very vital to practical applications. For this reason, as a group we focused on to develop bimetallic type catalysts adding one noble metal to a non-noble one especially cobalt. Some monometallic cobalt-containing catalysts for hydrogen release from ammonia borane hydrolysis include the employment of followings over the years: ɤ-Al2O3-, SiO2- and C-supported cobalt [6a], Co(0)-zeolite-Y nanoclusters [9c], Co(0)-HAP nanoclusters [9a], p (AMPS)-Co [12], Co/IR-120 [13], MOF-derived Co(0) [14], Co@SiO2 [15], Co@MCM-41 [16], Co(0)-graphene [17], Co(0)-MWCNT [18], Co–TiO2 [19], Co-GO [20], Co2+ and Co(0) [21], Co(0)-MIL-101 [22], G6-OH(Co60) [23], Co-rGO [24], PSMA-Co(0) [25], and Co(0)-nanoceria [26]. However, their turnover frequency (TOF) values are relatively low and changes between 4.5 min−1 and 25.7 min−1. Bimetallic type cobalt catalysts tested in this hydrolysis reaction include CuxCo1-x@SiO2 NPs [27], Co–B nanoflakes [28], Ag–Co/PAMAM NPs [29], Cu–Co/PDDA-HNTs [30], RuCo@MIL-96 [31], CoRu@N–C [32], CoxNi1-x/MCNTs [33], Pt–Co@PG [34], CoxCu1-x [35], AgxCo1-x@PAMAM/rGO [36], FexCo1-x-NCNTs [37], Au–Co/CNTs [38], CoPd/rGO [39], Co–P [40], CoS NPs [41], Au@Co NPs [42], CoW NPs [43], Pt–Co NPs [44]. By using these catalysts, much higher TOF values changing from 15.8 min−1 to 461.7 min−1 were obtained. In the current study, I present the first-time synthesis of cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters stabilized by poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) by a modified alcohol reduction method of Toshima et al.’s [45] and their use as rather effective catalyst to produce hydrogen from ammonia borane via hydrolysis pathway."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Cobalt (II) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O), rhodium (III) chloride trihydrate (RhCl3 . 3H2O), ethanol, poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP-40), and ammonia borane (H3NBH3) were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich company to synthesize nanoclusters and conduct kinetic studies. All kinetic studies were performed by deionized water. Before starting the experiments, all glassware and magnets were washed by deionized water and ethanol and dried at 150 °C."
3,Synthesis of catalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of catalyst Poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters were successfully synthesized by a modified method of alcohol reduction [45]. In the content of the present study, poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium with four different compositions (with Co:Rh ratios of 20:80, 35:65, 50:50, and 70:30) were synthesized. From comparison of their catalytic activities in terms of turnover frequencies, it was found that poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoparticles with equal composition (50:50) of both metals was the best catalyst for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane due to high synergistic effects between two metals during nanoparticle formation. Therefore, poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoparticles of equal composition (Co:Rh ratio of 50:50) were selected to perform ongoing kinetic studies in the course of this study. In a sample procedure, 25 mL water solution of cobalt (II) chloride hexahydrate (0.25 mmol) were mixed with 25 mL ethanolic solution of rhodium (III) chloride trihydrate (0.25 mmol). To this mixture, 2.5 mmol monomeric units of solid poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) was added at once. The resulting mixture was refluxed for 2–4 h to form very stable colloids of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters. During this synthesis procedure, total concentration of cobalt and rhodium was kept constant at 5.0 mM in 50 mL of water/ethanol mixture. In this process, poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) behaves as a reducing agent besides a stabilizing agent. Poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters synthesized by this way were very stable and durable for a long time at room temperature without any sign of agglomeration."
4,Catalytic evaluation tests for hydrogen generation,"2.3 Catalytic evaluation tests for hydrogen generation Catalytic performance of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters to produce pure hydrogen from ammonia borane via hydrolysis pathway was investigated by measuring water displacement level in a specific apparatus designed to measure the volume of evolved hydrogen gas. In this apparatus, a jacketed glass reaction vessel provided constant temperature for kinetic studies by water circulated through its jacket. In a typical test, 31.8 mg (1 mmol) of ammonia borane (H3NBH3) was first dissolved in x mL of deionized water before transferred to reaction vessel to be thermostated at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. Then, (10-x) mL of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters colloids were very quickly put into this solution to start instant evolution of hydrogen gas whose volume was recorded at constant time intervals. The complete metaborate conversion of ammonia borane was also proved by 11B NMR spectroscopy by following the change in signal positions (AB (δ = −23.9 ppm) and metaborate (δ = 9 ppm) [46]). TOF values of all poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoparticles were calculated by using Eq. (2): (2) TOF = moles of H 2 moles of catalyst x time"
5,The effect of PVP concentration on catalytic performance of the catalysts in ammonia borane hydrolysis,"2.4 The effect of PVP concentration on catalytic performance of the catalysts in ammonia borane hydrolysis To understand the effect of PVP concentration on catalytic performance of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium in ammonia borane hydrolysis (100 mM), the same studies were performed with catalysts synthesized at different [PVP/Catalyst] ratios (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14). All of these experiments were carried out by the same procedure described in Section 2.3. and the best [PVP/Catalyst] ratio was 10. When the [PVP/Catalyst] ratio is less than 10, the catalytic performance of the catalyst is found to be highly lower since PVP molecules do not cover the nanoparticles’ surface properly that leads to decreased catalytic performance by not preventing the agglomeration of nanoparticles. When the [PVP/Catalyst] ratio is greater than 10, the catalytic performance of the catalyst tends to decrease most probably due to the nanoparticles’ surface may be totally covered by PVP that blocks the substrate molecules to access to the active sites. As a result, the ideal [PVP/Catalyst] ratio was chosen as 10 for subsequent kinetic studies."
6,Durability tests for catalyst,"2.5 Durability tests for catalyst The recyclability of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters in ammonia borane hydrolysis was investigated by some experiments starting with a 10 mL solution containing 0.20 mM poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters and 100 mM ammonia borane at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. After reaching the complete metaborate conversion of ammonia borane, a new batch of it (same amount at the beginning each time) quickly added to reaction vessel and this was continued by this way up to fifth catalytic run. The obtained results for durability tests were presented as TOF values of each cycle against catalytic run number for ammonia borane hydrolysis."
7,Techniques for characterization of catalyst,"2.6 Techniques for characterization of catalyst For the characterization of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters, UV–Vis spectroscopy (operating Varian Cary 5000 model instrument), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (operating SPECS brand instrument), and transmission electron microscopy (operating JEOL-2010 model instrument) analyses were carried out. For metaborate conversion of ammonia borane, 11B NMR spectroscopy (operating Bruker Avance DPX 400 model instrument) was conducted."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Synthesis and characterization of catalyst,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of catalyst Poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters were readily synthesized by co-reduction of cobalt and rhodium cations by alcohol reduction method. First, appropriate cobalt and rhodium salts were dissolved in ethanol/water mixture. Then, PVP was added and the mixture was refluxed for 2 h. In this step, individual cobalt and rhodium atoms were formed from the reduction of corresponding cobalt and rhodium ions. After that, PVP-stabilized cobalt and rhodium atoms were quickly aggregated into clusters and then grew to form desired alloyed nanostructure [47] as shown in a plausible formation pathway in Fig. 1 . In this process, PVP can serve as a surface stabilizer and a growth modifier as well as a reducing agent [48]. PVP is known to be widely used for nanoparticle synthesis being a bulky, non-toxic, and non-ionic polymer having different functional groups (CO, C–N, CH2) [49]. It possesses strongly hydrophilic (pyrrolidone component) and highly hydrophobic (alkyl group) moieties. Therefore, water and some other non-aqueous liquids appear to be good solvents for PVP. It is considered to be an excellent stabilizer that prevents the agglomeration of nanoparticles by repulsive forces that stem from its hydrophobic carbon chains that extend into solvents and interact with each other, called as hindrance effect [50]. For characterization of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters, the first analysis was UV–Vis electronic absorption spectroscopy. UV–Vis spectroscopy allows us to easily follow the reduction of cobalt and rhodium cations to the corresponding zero valence counterparts due to complete disappearance of absorption peaks belong to Co2+ and Rh3+ ions and thus proving the formation of nanoclusters as depicted in Fig. 2 . The mean particle size of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters was determined by conducting TEM analysis and appropriate TEM image is given in Fig. 3 A. Mean particle size was computed to be 3.6 nm by using the corresponding histogram shown in Fig. 3B. Alloy formation between cobalt and rhodium during the synthesis of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters was checked and proved by HR-TEM analysis as given in Fig. 3C. The lattice fringe length of them was determined to be 0.225 nm which falls between the lattice fringe lengths of Co(220) plane (0.216 nm) [51] and Rh (100) plane (0.232 nm) [52], confirming alloy formation between cobalt and rhodium. X-ray photoelectron spectrum was taken to understand chemical states of cobalt and rhodium elements in poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters. The regions for Co 2p and Rh 3d are deconvoluted as presented in Fig. 4 . In the Co 2p region (Fig. 4A), two clear absorption bands are present for zerovalent cobalt centered at 780.1 eV for 2p3/2 and 796.1 eV for 2p1/2 [27,53]. The other absorption bands stood for oxidized cobalt and were observed due to cobalt’s high sensitivity of air oxygen while preparing samples for XPS analysis [54]. Rh 3d region is identified by a doublet that stems from splitting of spin-orbit coupling of 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 (Fig. 4B). Rh (0) 3d 3/2 and Rh (0) 3d5/2 absorption bands are found to be centered at binding energies of 313.2 and 308.3 eV [55]. These little changes in binding energy values of both cobalt 2p and rhodium 3d regions stem from the changes in electron densities around both metals also confirm the alloy formation between cobalt and rhodium during the formation of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters."
10,Catalytic evaluation of catalyst in ammonia borane hydrolysis,"3.2 Catalytic evaluation of catalyst in ammonia borane hydrolysis By conducting catalytic hydrolysis reaction of ammonia borane in a similar manner described in section 2.3, poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters were determined to be very efficient catalysts to produce hydrogen gas from this reaction. By plotting ratio of released hydrogen gas volume to ammonia borane concentration against reaction duration one could end up with straight lines for ammonia borane hydrolysis (100 mM) catalyzed by poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters at various concentrations (0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30 mM) as shown in Fig. 5 . The straight lines indicates the instant release of hydrogen gas by poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters until completion. During hydrolysis of ammonia borane solution, any potential ammonia gas (NH3) liberation was also checked by conducting some tests employing copper (II) sulfate trap with acid-base indicators. This control is very vital for fuel cell applications since ammonia gas could poison the fuel cell. At the end of this control test, no ammonia gas evolution was detected under present conditions as stated in a similar way in the literature [56]. Poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters (0.30 mM) reached to TOF value of 154 min−1 for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane at 25 °C. When almost all of the cobalt-containing catalysts are quickly reviewed in the literature, it is found that this TOF value of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters is one of the highest TOF values reported ever. Some of those catalysts include Co(0)@SiO2 nanoparticles (13.3 min−1) [15], Co(0)/graphene nanoparticles (13.8 min−1) [17], Co-GO (5.63 min−1) [20], crystalline Co-MIL-101 (9.9 min−1) [22], amorphous Co-MIL-101 (22.3 min−1) [22], G6-OH(Co60) (10.0 min−1) [23], Co-rGO (12.1 min−1) [24], Co(0)-PSMA (25.7 min−1) [25], Co(0)-nanoceria (7.0 min−1) [26], Ag–Co@PAMAM nanoparticles (15.8 min−1) [29], Cu–Co/PDDA-HNTs (30.8 min−1) [30], CoNi/MCNTs (33 min−1) [33], Ag–Co@PAMAM/rGO (19.8 min−1) [36], Au–Co/CNT (36.1 min−1) [38], CoW/RGO (16.4 min−1) [43], CuCo/rGO (50.6 min−1) [57], Pt–Co (123.1 min−1) [58], Au–Co@CN (48.3 min−1) [59], RuCo@MIL-53(Al) (87.2 min−1) [60], CoRh@ZIF-67 (100.2 min−1) [61], RuCo@MIL-96 (320.7 min−1) [31], CoRu@N–C (457.8 min−1) [32], Pt–Co@PG (461.2 min−1) [34]. This rather high TOF value of a non-noble metal containing catalyst is most probably due to their relatively small size and alloy structure. The enhanced catalytic activities of alloy-type bimetallic nanoparticles are attributed to one of the following major effects; called as ensemble (geometric) effect, ligand (electronic) effect, or strain effect [62]. The first one (ensemble effect) is related to changes in the local chemisorptions features by a direct change in the atomic ensemble constituents in adsorption site [63] while the second one (ligand effect) defines the surface electronic structure tuning in the same ensemble of surface but in a distinct atomic environment [64]. Lastly, the third one (strain effect) defines the changes in bond lengths of materials owing to variances in lattice constants of the constituents [65]. Although it is experimentally very difficult to differentiate these major effects on alloy structures because of the heterogeneous distribution of atomic ensembles, it is believed that the high catalytic activities of random alloy nanoparticles are due to the ensemble effect [66]. Poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters-catalyzed (0.20 mM) hydrolysis of ammonia borane (100 mM) to produce hydrogen was also conducted at different temperatures (20, 25, 30, 35, 40 °C). The results are presented as the ratio of released hydrogen gas volume to ammonia borane concentration against reaction duration as shown in Fig. 6 and it was found that rates of hydrogen generation increased quickly with the increasing temperature, as expected. The observed rate constants for hydrogen release from ammonia borane hydrolysis were computed from linear sections of the straight lines given in Fig. 6 for five different temperatures. Then, they were used to calculate the energy of activation for poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters in the hydrolysis of ammonia borane as Ea = 42.7 kJmol-1 from Arrhenius plot given in Fig. 7 . Although it is not a direct measure of reaction fastness, the activation energy of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters in ammonia borane hydrolysis is lower than that of Co(0)-HAP (50 kJmol-1) [9a], p (AMPS)-Co (47.7 kJmol-1) [12], G6-OH(Co60) (50.2 kJmol-1) [23], Co@rGO (45.5 kJmol-1) [24], Co(0)@nanoceria (43 kJmol-1) [26], CoNi@MCNTs (52.1 kJmol-1) [33], Co–P@TiO2 (48.1 kJmol-1) [40]; but still higher than that of Co(0)-MOF (35.5 kJmol-1) [14],Co(0)@SiO2 (42 kJmol-1) [15], Co-graphene (32.8 kJmol-1) [17], amorphous Co@MIL-101 (31.3 kJmol-1) [22], PSMA-Co (34 kJmol-1) [25], Cu–Co@SiO2 (24 kJmol-1) [27], Co–B nanoflakes (16.5 kJmol-1) [28], Ag–Co@PAMAM (35.7 kJmol-1) [29], RuCo@MIL-96 (36 kJmol-1) [31]."
11,Recyclability of catalyst in ammonia borane hydrolysis,"3.3 Recyclability of catalyst in ammonia borane hydrolysis In order to determine the recyclability of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters in ammonia borane hydrolysis, some kinetic experiments were conducted by adding new batches of ammonia borane consecutively after reaching complete conversion to metaborate in each cycle. The results of these experiments are presented in Fig. 8 as the change in TOF values of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters in each catalytic cycle continued until fifth cycle. It is worth to note that, poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters provided 100% conversion of ammonia borane to metaborate in each cycle. From this figure, it is easily understood that poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters still hold 75% of their initial catalytic activity reaching TOF value of 115 min−1 compared to initial TOF value of 154 min−1. This slight decline in catalytic activity of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters is partly due to little increment in particle size as seen from TEM image taken at the end of fifth catalytic run (Fig. 3D). The other reason is the inactivation of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters’ active sites by increasing metaborate accumulation on them during consecutive catalytic runs [6e]."
12,Conclusions,This present study allows us to come up with following experimental and scientific results: ❖ Poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters can readily be synthesized by simultaneous reduction of cobalt and rhodium cations by PVP under reflux. ❖ Poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters are determined to be highly effective catalysts to release hydrogen from ammonia borane hydrolysis. ❖ 154 min−1 TOF value and 42.7 kJmol-1 activation energy values are obtained by using poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters as catalysts in hydrolysis of ammonia borane. ❖ The obtained kinetic results show that poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized cobalt-rhodium nanoclusters are very promising catalysts for fuel cell applications using borane compounds as fuel.
