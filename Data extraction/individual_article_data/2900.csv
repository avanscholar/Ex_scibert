0,Introduction,"Environmental pollution and energy crisis have become increasingly serious global issues nowadays, which have aroused much attention of researchers. Hydrogen (H2), as a suitable substitute to fossil fuels, has gradually become popular in the field of energy research all over the world because of its intrinsic quality of environmental friendliness and renewability [1–5]. At present, photocatalytic hydrogen production technology is one of the most prospective techniques to produce clean energy, supplying an effective way to convert solar energy into H2 as a renewable green fuel [6,7]. At the same time, photocatalytic technology can also degrade organic pollutants in wastewater to protect environment. Therefore, the development of semiconductor photocatalysts with cost-effectiveness, high efficiency and easy recovery in the field of photocatalysis is the key to sustainable development [8,9]. Recently, many methods have been developed to prepare semiconductor photocatalytic materials, such as hydrothermal [10], solvothermal [11], calcination [12], sol-gel [13] and electrospinning [3,14], etc. Among these methods, electrospinning is a facile and straightforward method to obtain continuous fibers from polymer solutions and control fiber diameters ranging from nanometers to micrometers [15,16]. At present, a variety of semiconductor nanomaterials have been well developed as photocatalysts, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), which shows perfect features of non-toxic and low price [17–21]. Nevertheless, TiO2 can only absorb ultraviolet light (λ < 390 nm), accounting for less than 5% of the whole solar spectrum, so it has a disappointing absorption capacity in the visible light region. Bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6), as a new type of photocatalyst, has attracted much attention due to its easy preparation, strong visible light capture capability, attractive electronic structure and physicochemical stability [22]. However, the photocatalytic performance of pure Bi2WO6 is still hindered by the factors, such as poor photo-stability and the higher recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers, etc. Therefore, in order to make full use of the advantages of TiO2 and Bi2WO6, overcome their respective shortcomings, it is an effective strategy to construct them into suitable heterojunctions to achieve high catalytic performance in hydrogen evolution and degradation of organic pollutant. The purpose of forming heterojunction is to realize visible light absorption by sensitizing TiO2 with Bi2WO6, and inhibit the recombination of carriers in the composite materials [23–26]. However, the direct mixing of TiO2 and Bi2WO6 by conventional mono-axial electrospinning can also form heterojunctions, but there are three cases of contact between TiO2 and TiO2, Bi2WO6 and Bi2WO6, TiO2 and Bi2WO6. The effective heterojunction between TiO2 and Bi2WO6 only makes up a small part, and TiO2 and Bi2WO6 are easy to aggregate, thus reducing the active sites of catalytic reaction. Janus nanofiber is composed of two sides with different materials tightly connected together. Particular structure affords Janus nanofiber with different chemical properties and dual functions. A clear boundary can be formed between the two sides of Janus nanofiber. The heterojunction between the two photocatalysts is easily formed when two different photocatalysts are respectively used to construct the two sides of Janus nanofiber, which can respond to the light of different wavelengths, so that the light response range of Janus nanofiber can be greatly expanded. By selecting two different photocatalysts of various energy band structures and band gaps, the matching of energy band structures and band gaps is realized in Janus nanofiber to promote separation of photo-induced charge carriers to obtain outstanding photocatalytic performances. The synergistic effect between two sides of Janus nanofiber also can efficaciously improve the photocatalytic performance and expand the scope of applications. Besides, Janus nanofiber also has the common characteristics of nanofiber, such as large aspect ratio and specific surface area, easy separation and recovery, conductive to transportation of photo-induced charge carriers, etc. Hence, Janus nanofibers photocatalyst can achieve more excellent photocatalytic performances owing to above-mentioned advantages and will play an important role in photocatalytic applications. Therefore, we designed a unique Janus structure of nanofibers prepared by conjugate electrospinning [27], in which one side of Janus nanofiber is TiO2 and the other side is Bi2WO6. Compared with ordinary mono-component TiO2 and Bi2WO6 nanofiber, the Janus nanofiber can form unique heterojunction between TiO2 and Bi2WO6 and broaden light response range. Another problem encountered by most of semiconductor catalysts is that they are difficult to recycle because of their poor mechanical properties. As we all know, electrospun one-dimensional carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have been extensively used in the field of photocatalysis due to high porosity, good conductivity and strong mechanical properties, etc. Especially, CNFs have been applied as ideal electron channels because of their high electron transport properties and high conductivity [28,29]. Hence, in order to simultaneously heighten the photocatalytic activity and recyclability of photocatalysts, the combination of one-dimensional CNFs with other semiconductor catalysts has been studied as a promising solution [30]. Porous CNFs are widely used as photocatalyst carriers with the following advantages. Firstly, large surface area of CNFs can supply more catalytic sites, thus promoting the adsorption of photocatalyst to target molecules. Secondly, CNFs present better mechanical properties and are beneficial to the recovery and reuse of photocatalysts. Thirdly, conductive CNFs can promote the electrons migrate process and then restrain the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, thus promoting the photocatalytic reaction [31–33]. Based on above considerations, here in, a novel [TiO2/C]//[Bi2WO6/C] Janus nanofiber heterojunction photocatalyst (defined as JNHP) is synthesized by conjugate electrospinning to efficiently generate H2 from water and degrade methylene blue dye, thus achieving bifunctional characteristics. Specifically, one side of JNHP contains Bi2WO6 and C nanofiber mainly responding to visible light and the other side contains TiO2 and C nanofiber primarily responding to ultraviolet light, and the synergistic effect of both sides can improve the utilization of sunlight. The heterojunctions formed on both sides of JNHP and the conductive properties of one-dimensional CNFs, both of which contribute to promote charges separation. JNHP uses CNFs as matrixes with a good flexible self-supporting structure that floats on the H2 production or degradation solution, which promotes the recovery and reutilization of the catalyst. To our knowledge, no report on this special Janus structure carbon-based photocatalyst is found so far. Therefore, this innovative work offers a new perspective to develop high-efficiency and easy recovery photocatalysts in the fields of solar energy conversion to hydrogen energy and degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater, etc."

2,Materials,2.1 Materials The materials used throughout the experiments were listed in the Supporting Information.
3,Synthesis of spinning solutions,"2.2 Synthesis of spinning solutions JNHP was synthesized by combining conjugate electrospinning with the carbonization process in nitrogen atmosphere. Two types of spinning solutions (abbreviated as spinning solution A and spinning solution B) were adopted to fabricate the [TiO2/polyacrylonitrile (PAN)]//[(NH4)10W12O41/Bi(NO3)3/Citric acid (CA)/PAN] Janus nanofibers. The spinning solution A was prepared as following: TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were dispersed in 10.0 g of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with vigorous stirring for 12 h, and then 1.0 g of PAN was added into the above homogenous solution under stirring for 30 min at 60 °C to form homogenous spinning solution A. For preparing spinning solution B, 0.1521 g of (NH4)10W12O41 and 0.2522 g of CA were mixed with distilled water, and the solvent was evaporated to form gel under stirring at 100 °C, then 10.0 g of DMF, 0.5822 g of Bi(NO3)3 and 1.0 g of PAN were successively put into the above mixture. The obtained admixture was continuously stirred at 60 °C until a uniform spinning solution B was formed. The amount of TiO2 NPs in [TiO2/PAN]//[(NH4)10W12O41/Bi(NO3)3/CA/PAN] Janus nanofibers was optimized to acquire optimum photocatalytic performance. The amount of Bi2WO6 was fixed and remained unchanged during the experiments. The ingredients of spinning solution A and B were listed in Table S1."
4,Preparation of JNHP and contrast samples,"2.3 Preparation of JNHP and contrast samples The JNHP was prepared by conjugate electrospinning followed by heat treatment, and the preparation process diagram was shown in Fig. 1 . The conjugate electrospinning setup consisted of two high-voltage power supply, two syringes and rotating roller as a collector. The obtained spinning solutions A and B were separately injected into the 5-mL syringes. Positive and negative high voltage were respectively fixed at 7 kV, the feed rate of spinning solutions was 1 mL h−1, and the distance between needle tips and the collector was 16 cm. In addition, the angle between the syringes and the horizontal line was respectively 45°, and the conjugate electrospinning was carried out. When the electrospinning was finished, the nanofiber membrane of [TiO2/PAN]//[(NH4)10W12O41/Bi(NO3)3/CA/PAN] was obtained. The resultant nanofiber membrane was heated at 270 °C for 1 h in the air, and then was respectively carbonized at 700, 800 and 900 °C for 2 h under a nitrogen flow at the heating rate of 2 °C·min−1, and then cooled down to 200 °C at a cooling rate of 5 °C·min−1 and finally cooled down to room temperature naturally. Photocatalysts with better photocatalytic performance were obtained by adjusting the concentration of TiO2. The amount of Bi2WO6 in the (NH4)10W12O41/Bi(NO3)3/CA/PAN nanofiber on the one side of the Janus nanofiber was fixed, and the amount of TiO2 relative to PAN on other side of the Janus nanofiber was changed from 10%, 30%–50%, respectively. Therefore, aimed products were respectively marked as 10% TiO2-JNHP (JNHP-1), 30% TiO2-JNHP (JNHP-2) and 50% TiO2-JNHP (JNHP-3). In addition, the preparation process and schematic diagram of the contrast samples TiO2/C, Bi2WO6/C carbon-based nanofiber photocatalysts and [TiO2/C]+[Bi2WO6/C] mixed nanofiber photocatalyst (respectively marked as T-NP, B-NP and M-NP) were given in the experimental part of the Supporting Information (Fig. S1)."
5,Characterization methods,2.4 Characterization methods The characterization methods were shown in the Supporting Information.
6,Formation mechanism for the JNHP,"2.5 Formation mechanism for the JNHP Fig. 1 displays the process of conjugate electrospinning. Under the action of the electric field force, the droplets at the nozzles of the two spinnerets overcome the surface tension and form a jet that moves in the air for a period of time. With the volatilization of the solvent, the jet undergoes a whipping process to form two successive nanofibers with positive and negative charges. The nanofibers on both sides attract each other along the electric field path, encounter between two spinnerets and attract together by electrostatic attraction, and then move downward under the action of gravity to form electrically neutral Janus nanofibers. Nanofibers with the same charge (e.g. TiO2/PAN nanofibers or (NH4)10W12O41/Bi(NO3)3/CA/PAN nanofibers) cannot be gathered together to form Janus nanofibers due to electrostatic repulsion. A rotating roller is used as a collection apparatus for the Janus nanofiber bundles. The collected Janus nanofibers are pulled onto the rotating roller. The Janus nanofibers will be attracted and wrapped on roller surface to form JNHP with the rotation of the roller."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structure and phase composition,"3.1 Structure and phase composition The crystal structure and relative intensity of the diffraction peaks of JNHP-2 at carbonization temperature of 700, 800 and 900 °C are analyzed by XRD spectra (Fig. 2 ). The diffraction peaks of anatase phase TiO2 and rutile phase TiO2 correspond to PDF#83-2243 and PDF#76-1939 standard cards of TiO2, respectively [34,35]. Moreover, the peaks of rutile phase gradually become stronger with increasing of carbonization temperature, indicating that rutile phase TiO2 content increases with the augment of calcination temperature. In addition, XRD patterns of JNHP present other three weak peaks at 28.29°, 32.66° and 48.52° assigned to russellite phase Bi2WO6 (PDF#79-2381)34. Besides a broad peak around 28°, no obvious carbon signals are observed due to the presence of carbon in an amorphous form. According to the related literature, the TiO2 has higher photocatalytic performance when the mixed phases of anatase and rutile of TiO2 are simultaneously existent in a certain ratio [36]."
9,Structure and morphology studies,"3.2 Structure and morphology studies The morphologies and structures of [TiO2/PAN]//[(NH4)10W12O41/Bi(NO3)3/CA/PAN] Janus nanofiber and JNHP are presented by using SEM (Fig. 3 ). The nanofiber photocatalysts have a high aspect ratio and good orientational arrange to form an array nanofiber membrane, as indicated in Fig. 3a. The nanofibers obtained by conjugate electrospinning have exceptional Janus structure and each single Janus nanofiber consists of two parallel fibers bound together (Fig. 3b). The diameter of [TiO2/PAN]//[(NH4)10W12O41/Bi(NO3)3/CA/PAN] Janus nanofiber is almost the same, and the average size is ca. 807 ± 2 nm (Fig. 3c). However, the diameter of JNHP-2 (calcined at 800 °C) is 762 ± 0.5 nm (Fig. 3g), which is about 5.6% smaller than that of [TiO2/PAN]//[(NH4)10W12O41/Bi(NO3)3/CA/PAN] Janus nanofiber mainly because of the decomposition of PAN matrix at high temperature. After calcination, JNHP remain intact Janus structure without obvious fracture, and the amount of TiO2 NPs exposed on the surface of JNHP increases with the increase of TiO2 content (Fig. 3d–f). A small amount of TiO2 NPs appears on the surface of JNHP-1, resulting in poor catalytic activity (Fig. 3d). Simultaneously, more TiO2 NPs are homogeneously embedded on the surface of JNHP-2 and there is no obvious aggregation with the particle size range from a few nanometers to several tens of nanometers, as seen in Fig. 3e. However, TiO2 NPs aggregate on the surface of JNHP when the concentration of TiO2 NPs is further increased to 50%, leading to reduction in the contact area between catalyst particles and target molecules, thereby reducing active sites of the reaction (Fig. 3f). Good morphology of JNHP is crucial for excellent photocatalytic performance. Fig. 3(d–f) indicate that nanofibers remain continuous and complete Janus structure after carbonization, demonstrating that carbon-based photocatalysts have strong mechanical properties. Fig. 3h presents the EDS line-scan test result of Janus nanofibers in JNHP-2, in which Ti and Bi elements represent TiO2 and Bi2WO6, respectively. The Ti element locates on the left side of the Janus nanofiber and Bi element is found on right side of Janus nanofiber, further proving that Janus nanofibers are successfully prepared by conjugate electrospinning. Fig. 3i shows the digital photographs of [TiO2/C]//[Bi2WO6/C] Janus nanofibers membrane before and after folding. The surface of [TiO2/C]//[Bi2WO6/C] Janus nanofibers membrane is flat and smooth before folding. It is found that the membrane can be folded and the original appearance is still kept and no fracture is observed after folding, indicating that [TiO2/C]//[Bi2WO6/C] Janus nanofibers membrane has good flexibility and self-supporting property."
10,Thermal analysis,"3.3 Thermal analysis The carbon content of JNHP is analyzed by TGA (Fig. 4 a), the weights of JNHP-1, JNHP-2 and JNHP-3 change significantly in the following two stages. The weight loss of JNHP is small before 100 °C, which is due to the evaporation of water absorbed by JNHP. The decomposition temperatures of JNHP-1, JNHP-2 and JNHP-3 are about 350 °C, 420 °C and 480 °C, respectively. At ca. 530, 580 and 620 °C, the oxidation combustion of CNFs in JNHP-1, JNHP-2 and JNHP-3 is basically over, respectively. It is observed that the decomposition temperature and end of decomposition temperature of JNHP augments with increasing in content of inorganic oxide (TiO2), and the result is in agreement with the literature [37]. The obvious weight loss of JNHP in the range of 360–620 °C can be ascribed to the oxidation combustion decomposition and evaporation of CNFs. CNFs are completely evaporated when the temperature rises to 1200 °C and the content of final residues of three samples is approximately 13.2, 18.7 and 25.1%, respectively, where these residues derive from TiO2 and Bi2WO6 NPs in JNHP. Fig. 4b manifests that JNHP-2 has typical adsorption behavior and belongs to isotherm of type IV [6]. JNHP-2 consists of hierarchical porous structures of micropores, mesopores and macropores. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and average pore diameter of JNHP-2 are calculated to be 29.64 m2 g−1 and 24 nm, respectively."
11,UV-Vis adsorption spectrum,"3.4 UV-Vis adsorption spectrum As depicted in Fig. 5 , the absorption edges of T-NP and B-NP are respectively about 390 and 440 nm, illustrating that they mainly absorb ultraviolet and visible light, respectively. The absorption edge of JNHP-2 shifts to ca. 450 nm. Compared with T-NP and B-NP, the visible light harvesting ability of JNHP-2 is obviously enhanced because of the heterojunctions formed on both sides of Janus nanofibers. Furthermore, the corresponding optical band gap energy of the photocatalyst can be counted by using the optical absorption edge obtained from UV-Vis adsorption spectrum and Tauc model [6,17,34,38]: (αhv)2 = A(hv − Eg) In which α is the absorption coefficient, hv is the photon energy, A is a constant proportional to the absorption coefficient (α) and Eg is the band gap energy. The band gaps of T-NP and B-NP are 3.20 eV and 2.80 eV, respectively. The band gap of JNHP-2 is 2.70 eV due to the mixed-phase effects of semiconductors (inset in Fig. 5)17. All of as-fabricated photocatalysts have obvious absorption phenomenon in the long wavelength region of 400–700 nm, which is due to the scattering and absorption of light by the texture and pore structure of CNFs [34]."
12,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The photocatalytic H2 evolution performance analysis of photocatalysts are estimated by utilizing methanol as sacrificial agent under visible and simulated sunlight irradiation. Methanol can consume photo-induced holes and restrain the recombination of electrons and holes by providing electron donors [3,7,14]. As seen from Fig. 6 (a–c), the photocatalysts have the optimum hydrogen production when TiO2 content is 30% at different calcined temperatures (700, 800 and 900 °C). Among them, the hydrogen production of JNHP-2 (calcined at 800 °C) reaches 5209 μmol within 4.5 h, exhibiting the best photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the hydrogen production amounts of various photocatalysts synthesized at different calcination temperatures are summarized in detail, as shown in Table S2. In order to further assess the photocatalytic activity of as-fabricated photocatalysts, JNHP-2 (calcined at 800 °C) with the optimum hydrogen evolution is further compared with M-NP, T-NP and B-NP (Fig. 6d). It can be found from the data in Fig. 6d that JNHP-2 (calcined at 800 °C) still demonstrates the highest hydrogen production, which is due to the fact that the construction of heterojunctions inhibits the recombination of carriers, and detailed mechanism explanation can be found in “Mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution” section and Fig. 11a. However, B-NP does not form heterojunctions, charge carriers recombination efficiency is high, so it has a lower hydrogen production than JNHP-2. The reason why the hydrogen production of M-NP is lower than that of JNHP-2 is that T-NP and B-NP are not fully integrated, so the amount of heterojunctions formed is less. Since TiO2 mainly responds to ultraviolet light, the hydrogen production of T-NP is lowest under visible light. The proportion of T-NP and B-NP accounts for almost half of M-NP, and the amount of B-NP in M-NP is significantly less than that of pure B-NP, so that the hydrogen production of M-NP is lower than that of B-NP. To assess the stability and practicability of the photocatalyst, the cyclic hydrogen production experiments of JNHP-2 are carried out under visible light illumination. Fig. 6e presents that the amount of hydrogen production is almost no decrease after five consecutive cycles, and JNHP-2 is almost hardly broken under mechanical agitation, indicating that carbon-based photocatalysts have good mechanical and photo-stable properties. Therefore, JNHP-2 (calcined at 800 °C) has the best photocatalytic activity. As illustrated in Fig. 7 (a–c), by comparing the hydrogen evolution rates of JNHP with different TiO2 contents (calcined at 700, 800 and 900 °C) under visible light irradiation, JNHP-2 has the optimum hydrogen evolution rate, with hydrogen evolution rate of 9.60, 11.58 and 7.34 mmol h−1 g−1 at 700, 800 and 900 °C, respectively. In the meanwhile, the hydrogen production rates of the contrast samples (calcined at 800 °C) under visible light irradiation are analyzed, the results prove that the hydrogen production rate of JNHP-2 respectively is approximately 3.64, 11.82 and 2.85 times of M-NP, T-NP and B-NP (Fig. 7d). It is further demonstrated that JNHP-2 has the highest photocatalytic performance. Compared with visible light irradiation, the hydrogen production rates of the above four samples are significantly increased under simulated sunlight irradiation (Fig. 7e), and the hydrogen evolution rate of JNHP-2 (calcined at 800 °C) is as high as 16.32 mmol h−1 g−1. The hydrogen production rates of M-NP and B-NP are 5.68 and 4.13 mmol h−1 g−1, respectively, which are lower than that of JNHP-2 for the same reason as that of hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. The hydrogen evolution rate of T-NP increases to 4.61 mmol h−1 g−1, which is primarily attributed to the capture of ultraviolet light from sunlight. Obviously, the absorption ability of photocatalysts to light is enhanced under the irradiation of simulated sunlight, and the recombination rates of carriers at the heterojunction are reduced, thus the amount of hydrogen production is increased. The detailed mechanism process is shown in Fig. 11b. A comparison of hydrogen evolution for JNHP with other reported carbon supported TiO2 photocatalysts is exhibited in Table 1 . JNHP has better photocatalytic activity than the listed previous reported TiO2/C-based photocatalysts. Especially, no noble metals are added as cocatalyst in the process of hydrogen production in this work."
13,Photocatalytic degradation of MB,"3.6 Photocatalytic degradation of MB The photocatalytic activities of the synthesized photocatalysts are estimated by monitoring the photo-degradation performance of MB in aqueous solutions. The adsorption-desorption equilibrium between MB and the photocatalysts surface is achieved in the dark environment for 60 min, and JNHP possesses higher adsorption efficiency than the other contrast photocatalyst (Fig. 8 a). After visible light irradiation for 160 min, the photo-degradation rates of MB dye are approximately 86.9, 93.3 and 77.9% in the presence of JNHP-1, JNHP-2 and JNHP-3, respectively. In contrast, photo-degradation rates of M-NP, B-NP and T-NP are only 40.9, 47.4 and 30.1%, respectively. In other words, JNHP-1, JNHP-2 and JNHP-3 with Janus nanofiber structure exhibit the obviously improved photocatalytic activity compared with the three contrast nanofiber photocatalysts, the reason is owing to the construction of more heterojunctions in JNHP to heighten the photo-degradation rate. However, T-NP and B-NP in M-NP do not combine well and form fewer heterojunctions, while there is no heterojunction in T-NP and B-NP, resulting in the photo-degradation rate of M-NP, T-NP and B-NP is inferior to that of JNHP. In M-NP, B-NP to visible light response only accounts for a part of M-NP, resulting in the degradation rate of M-NP is lower than that of pure B-NP. T-NP hardly absorbs visible light, resulting in the lowest degradation rate. The degradation kinetics of MB was further studied to better understand the photo-degradation rate of photocatalysts (Fig. 8b). It is found that photocatalytic degradation accords with a pseudo-first-order kinetic model, which can be depicted as follows [39,41]: ln(C0/C) = kKt = kappt In the formula, C0, C, k, K, kapp and t are respectively initial concentration of MB, concentration at a certain time, the rate constant, the adsorption coefficient, the apparent pseudo-first-order rate constant and the corresponding irradiation time during degradation process. kapp is determined by the reaction rate constant (k) and the adsorption coefficient (K). The adsorption coefficient (K) is related to the adsorption active surface area (Aa/s). Nevertheless, the Aa/s values are also distinct due to the different adsorption performances of the photocatalysts (Fig. 8a, d). Hence, in order to eliminate the influence of adsorption in some extent, the normalized rate constant k’ (Kapp/Aa/s) is used to represent the actual photocatalytic reaction rate. If we presume that the Aa/s is directly proportional to the adsorption capacity of MB, then, (1) K ∝ Aa/s∝(C0/C)ads (2) kapp/K ∝ kapp/Aa/s ∝ kapp·(C/C0)ads (3) k’ = kapp/K = kapp·(C/C0)ads As shown in Fig. 8b, the normalized k’ values for the curves from top to bottom are 0.012, 0.009, 0.006, 0.003, 0.002 and 0.001 min−1, respectively. Obviously, the higher rate constant corresponds to better photocatalytic performance. The corresponding parameters of MB degradation under simulated sunlight irradiation can be referred to Fig. 8(d–f) and Table S3. Whether under the visible light or simulated sunlight irradiation, the results clearly demonstrate that JNHP-2 presents the highest photocatalytic performance, suggesting that the construction of suitable heterojunctions is the key to effectively separate electrons and holes, and the existence of one-dimensional CNFs with fairly good conductivity (3.72 × 10−2 S cm−1, measured through the Hall effect measurement system) is also beneficial to the separation and migration of electrons. Cycling experiments are performed by using the optimum sample JNHP-2, the first, second and third cycle degradation rates are respectively 93.3%, 92.9% and 92.7% under visible light irradiation, and 97.9%, 97.0% and 96.7% under simulated sunlight irradiation (Fig. 8c, f). The results exhibit that JNHP-2 has high catalytic activity and excellent reusability. Apparent pseudo-first-order rate constants (kapp) of JNHP and TiO2/C-based photocatalysts reported are compared to display superiority of JNHP, and related results are listed in Table 2 . Compared with the relevant TiO2/C-based photocatalysts, JNHP has higher kapp, proving that JNHP has more excellent degradation ability. The results exhibit that JNHP-2 has high catalytic activity and excellent reusability. More importantly, the JNHP-2 of unique nanofiber filmy structure has a flexible self-supporting structural performance, which can float on the solution in the process of photo-degradation, showing good structural integrity (Fig. 8j), so JNHP can be easily taken out and separated from the dye solution by using a tweezers and no needing long-time precipitation and separation process. The morphology, crystal structure and diffraction peaks position of the recovered JNHP-2 are almost unchanged (Fig. 8h and i). To sum up, from what has been discussed above, we can reasonably draw the conclusion that JNHP possesses excellent mechanical flexibility, good reusability and high efficient photocatalytic activity, which can be applied as a kind of easily recycled and high performance photocatalyst, indicating that JNHP can better meet the practical application of solar energy conversion to hydrogen energy and sewage purification, compared with the T-NP, B-NP and M-NP. Meanwhile, it also solves the dilemma that nanoparticles photocatalysts are easy to be lost, hard to be separated and reused and easily pollute water resource again. The above new findings fully demonstrate the structural superiority of JNHP. The capture experiments of JNHP-2 were carried out to study the main active species in the process of photocatalytic degradation. Disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Na2-EDTA), p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were respectively put in MB degradation system as trapping agents of h+, ·O2 − and ·OH. As displayed in Fig. 8g, the photocatalytic degradation rate of MB decreases obviously in the presence of p-BQ, indicating that ·O2 − plays dominant influence in the degradation test of MB. The photocatalytic degradation rate also decreases with the addition of Na2-EDTA and IPA. The results indicate that ·OH and h+ species also participate in the photocatalytic reaction. Therefore, h+, ·OH and ·O2 − all play different roles in photocatalytic decomposition process."
14,Photoluminescence spectra analysis,"3.7 Photoluminescence spectra analysis Photoluminescence (PL) spectra are a very powerful means to investigate the migration and separation efficiency of the photo-generated charge carriers in photocatalytic materials, and PL peak is primarily caused by the recombination of carriers [1,17,40]. Normally, the lower PL peak value suggests the higher separation rate and the higher photocatalytic performance. The emission peak intensity of JNHP-2 calcined at 800 °C is much lower than that of samples obtained at 700 and 900 °C, so it further reveals that 800 °C is optimum calcination temperature for the JNHP to obtain high catalytic performance (Fig. 9 a). Similarly, T-NP and B-NP show high PL peak intensity values, indicating that charge carriers recombination efficiency is high, further prove that there is no heterojunction in them, and the PL peak intensity of M-NP is slightly lower than that of T-NP and B-NP, which is due to the formation of small amounts of heterojunctions in M-NP. However, after T-NP and B-NP are combined by conjugate electrospinning to form JNHP, the intensity of PL peak of JNHP decrease rapidly (Fig. 9b). The results show that electrons and holes achieve effective separation, which is attributed to the formation of unique heterojunctions on both sides of Janus nanofiber in JNHP. In addition, conductive one-dimensional CNFs also play a vital role in the transportation of electrons, avoiding direct recombination of electrons and holes. After compounding, the peak intensity of JNHP-2 is obviously lower than that of JNHP-1 and JNHP-2, indicating that JNHP-2 could effectively inhibit the recombination of photo-induced electron-hole pairs, which is related to the uniform dispersion of catalyst particles. The above results are consistent with those of hydrogen generation and MB degradation."
15,Transient photocurrent response and elctrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis,"3.8 Transient photocurrent response and elctrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis To further prove the efficient separation of charge carriers in as-prepared photocatalysts, the transient photocurrent response (I-t) and elctrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of photocatalysts are tested in 0.2 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution [40], as displayed in Fig. 10 . The photocurrent density of four samples increases rapidly when the xenon lamp is on and decreases when the xenon lamp is off (Fig. 10a). The photocurrent density of JNHP-2 is significantly higher than that of T-NP, B-NP and M-NP under intermittent irradiation, indicating that JNHP-2 has higher light absorption capacity and could more effectively separate photo-induced charge carriers. In addition, JNHP-2 also has better photo-response and photo-stability. As displayed in Fig. 10b, the rapid charges transfer processes are further investigated by EIS. According to EIS data, the equivalent circuit diagram can be well fitted (inset in Fig. 10b). The circuit consists of solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), constant phase element (CPE) and Warburg impedance (W). The radius of EIS arc represents the magnitude of the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the separation efficiency of the electron-hole pairs. The smaller the radius of the arc is, the faster the electrons and holes separation efficiency of the photocatalyst becomes. Obviously, JNHP-2 exhibits the Rct value (42 Ω), T-NP (171 Ω), B-NP (458 Ω) and M-NP (147 Ω), which means that electron-hole pairs separation rate of JNHP is faster, indicating that the formation of heterojunction in JNHP effectively promotes the transfer of interface charges. Therefore, the JNHP has better photocatalytic performance than the other three samples."
16,Possible photocatalytic mechanisms of hydrogen evolution and MB degradation,"Enhancive photocatalytic performances of the JNHP can be well expounded via the following the mechanism diagram (Fig. 11 ). The band gap of JNHP-2 is about 2.70 eV. When visible light illuminates onto the surface of the JNHP, and the energy of the photon is greater than or equal to its band gap energy, Bi2WO6 NPs absorb visible light to generate electron-hole pairs, and photo-induced electrons (e−) are excited from the valence band (VB) of Bi2WO6 to the conduction band (CB). Because of the good conductivity of CNFs, electrons on the CB can easily move to the surface of CNFs, leaving holes in the VB. Moreover, the holes (h+) on the VB of Bi2WO6 are easily transferred to the VB of TiO2 is owing to the formation of heterojunction between TiO2 and Bi2WO6, thus electrons and holes are effectively separated and participate in redox reactions, then H+ in solution can react with electrons to produce H2, methanol molecules as a trapping agent for holes can be oxidized to HCHO, and further convert to CO2 and H2O (Fig. 11a and b). The specific reactions of water decomposition to produce H2 are as follows: (4) JNHP + hv → h+ + e− (5) h+ + H2O → ·OH + H+ (6) CH3OH + ·OH → ·CH2OH + H2O (7) ·CH2OH → HCHO + H+ + e− (8) HCHO + O2 → CO2 + H2O (9) 2H2O → 2H+ + 2OH− (10) 2H+ + 2e− → H2 In the process of photo-degradation of MB, the photo-generated holes in the VB of JNHP easily spread to the surface of JNHP and undergo an oxidation reaction with MB molecules. At the same time, photo-generated electrons can be trapped by dissolved O2 in water to produce O2 −, and then part of O2 − reacts with H2O to form ·OH. ·OH and O2 − active species with oxidizing properties which can degrade MB molecules (Fig. 11c and d). The specific reactions of photo-degradation MB are as follows: (11) JNHP + hv → h+ + e− (12) e− + O2 → ·O2 − (13) ·O2 − + H2O → ·HO2 + OH− (14) HO2 + H2O → H2O2 + ·OH (15) H2O2→ 2·OH (16) h+ + OH− →·OH (17) ·O2 −/h+/·OH + Organic pollutant (MB) → Degradation products + CO2 + H2O Under simulated sunlight irradiation, while Bi2WO6 NPs absorbs visible light, TiO2 can further absorb ultraviolet light. JNHP captures more light and produces more electron-hole pairs to participate in hydrogen production and degradation of MB, as displayed in Fig. 11b, d. In brief, the high photocatalytic activity of JNHP is mainly ascribed to the following points. Firstly, JNHP can form unique heterojunction structures, and catalyst particles are stably and uniformly embedded on the surface of JNHP, which is conducive to the absorption of light and the rapid migration and separation of carriers. Secondly, the electrical conductivity of carbon-based photocatalysts not only has strong adsorption performance for organic pollutants, but also helps electrons of CB to be quickly conducted away and avoid recombination with holes. Finally, homogeneous distribution of TiO2 and Bi2WO6 particles can supply more catalytic sites. Simultaneously, JNHP has better photocatalytic activity when the rutile and anatase phases of TiO2 exist in a certain ratio at calcination temperature of 800 °C."
17,Conclusions,"In summary, a novel-structure [TiO2/C]//[Bi2WO6/C] carbon-based Janus nanofibers heterojunction photocatalyst (named as JNHP) has been designed and successfully prepared by the combination of the conjugate electrospinning technique with the carbonization process. The advantages of Janus structure and materials, including the conductivity and flexibility of one-dimensional carbon nanofibers, forming uniform and stable heterojunctions between TiO2 and Bi2WO6 NPs, multiple active sites exposed on both sides of Janus nanofibers, etc. are fully combined and applied. The synergetic effect among them promotes the rapid separation of photo-induced charge carriers, and enhances the absorption of visible and ultraviolet light. Furthermore, high hydrogen yields of 11.58 and 11.62 mmol h−1 g−1 are respectively obtained on optimized JNHP under visible and simulated sunlight irradiation. Meanwhile, the photo-degradation rates of MB by JNHP respectively reach 93.3 and 97.9% after visible light irradiation for 160 min and simulated sunlight irradiation for 140 min. Therefore, JNHP achieves bifunctional characteristics of high efficient hydrogen evolution and degradation of organic pollutant. Moreover, JNHP also possess excellent photo-stability, flexibility and cycling performance in repeated applications. Our work provides a Janus structural heterojunction photocatalyst with superb properties, and more importantly, reasonable design concept and preparative method are advanced, which paves a new way for the synthesis of other bifunctional photocatalysts with high catalytic performance."
