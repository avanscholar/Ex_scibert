0,Introduction,"Alcohol ethoxylates (AE) has been used as an ideal replacement of alkylphenol ethoxylates (APE) due to the potential estrogenicity of APE degradation products (Merrettig-Bruns and Jelen, 2009), it is hence used widely in domestic and commercial detergents, household and personal care products (Traverso-Soto et al., 2013). However, the presence of AE in aquatic environment could cause acute and chronic effects in sensitive organisms, such as crustacean and fish (Ferraraa et al., 2005). Although AE can be efficiently removed by physical and chemical processes, such as adsorption and AOPs (Potapova et al., 2014; Da Silva et al., 2015), their cost is very high and chemical oxidation just destroys its initial molecule but generates carboxylic by-products. While the conventional processes for efficient treatment of AE containing wastewater, such as aerobic and anoxic techniques, are also not sustainable due to their energy intensive, large qualities of residuals production and failure to recover the potential resources available in wastewater (Martinez-Sosa et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2014). The anaerobic process is currently recognized as a promising technology due to its lower energy consumption, low sludge production and biogas generation (Hahn and Figueroa, 2015). Among the different anaerobic processes, the anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR), by coupling membrane filtration with anaerobic treatment, provides an alternative strategy for wastewater treatment with nearly absolute biomass retention and the potential to generate a higher quality effluent (Ng et al., 2015). At present, AnMBR has been successfully studied for the treatment of high strength wastewater, such as food and beverage industry wastewater and swine manure (Ng et al., 2015). Only recently, it has been used to treat municipal wastewater (Smith et al., 2012; Ozgun et al., 2013) and the influence of temperature, HRT, OLR, membrane characteristics on reactor performance has also been investigated in detail (Ozgun et al., 2013). Although the degradation of high concentration of alkylphenol ethoxylates (APE) and its toxicity or inhibition effect on the anaerobic microorganism have been studied (Song and Bielefeldt, 2012; Bozkurt and Sanin, 2014), however, the influence of alcohol ethoxylates (AE) on the microbe is little known since the increased consumption and production of AE compared with APE (Motteran et al., 2014a,b). Besides, an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor rather than AnMBR was used in the above studies. AE is considered biodegradable, while high rates of instabilities in biological process may occur in anaerobic treatment of wastewater containing these surfactants. Hence, it is also necessary to investigate the AE effect on AnMBR performance and methane production potential of sludge during municipal wastewater treatment. At present, the most widely accepted degradation pathway of AE under anaerobic condition involves the central fission of the ether bond between the alkyl and ethoxylated chain, resulting in the formation of fatty acids and PEGs (Huber et al., 2000). However, the conversion of PEG into smaller organic acids and then to methane is still lack of direct evidence. In general, few studies were conducted to explore the suitability of AnMBR in treatment of municipal wastewater if AE was present including the treatment efficiency, methanogenic activity of sludge and the response of microbial community structure. It is very important for the application of AnMBR in practical wastewater treatment. In this study, the influence of AE on AnMBR performance during municipal wastewater treatment was firstly investigated via long-term operation, such as the COD removal, biogas production, SMP/EPS generation, membrane fouling and sludge concentration. On the other side, sludge self-acclimation to alcohol ethoxylates on the specific methanogenic activity was further evaluated by comparing their difference before and after long term acclimation. Hence, the microbial diversity distribution may changed after long term acclimation in treatment of alcohol ethoxylates containing wastewater, which led to higher methane recovery efficiency. Finally, the role of AE on the anaerobic microbes and the response of microbial community structure to AE presence were investigated and discussed by the pyrosequencing method. The findings in this study are expected to provide some useful information that whether SAnMBR is suitable to dispose the AE containing municipal wastewater."
1,Experimental and methods,
2,SAnMBR setup and operation,"2.1 SAnMBR setup and operation As shown in Fig. S1, a submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor (SAnMBR) with a working volume of 6L was operated at 25±1°C using a flat-sheet submerged membrane (Kubota Corporation, Osaka, Japan). The membrane that fixed in the lower part of SAnMBR was made of chlorinated polyethylene with a non-woven fibrous support (polyethylene terephthalate: PET), which has a normal pore size of 0.2μm and a total area of 0.116m2. A coarse tube diffuser was located below the membrane. Biogas in the headspace was recirculated by a pump at a flow rate of 5L/min to provide membrane hydrodynamic shearing and reactor mixing. Permeate was suctioned by a peristaltic pump. trans-membrane pressure (TMP) was measured by a pressure sensor located on the permeate line. The reactor was warmed by water circulation. A wet gas meter was used to measure the amount of daily biogas. The characteristics and composition of the synthetic municipal wastewater were shown in Table S1. The substrate tank was stirred (200–300rpm) to keep the substrate at a uniform state. The reactor was inoculated with waste activated sludge from the municipal sewage treatment plant (Sendai, Japan). The long-term experiment was divided into stage I (without AE, 80days, 2 phases), stage II (with AE 5 and 10mg/L, 247days, 3 phases) and stage III (with AE 50–200mg/L, 64days, 3 phases). The reactor operation at different phases were summarize in Table 2 . Fig. S2 showed the structure of used AE (decaethylene glycol mono-dodecyl ether, Sigma-Aldrich). Membrane was changed once the TMP reached above 30kPa. After putting back the cleaned membrane, air in the reactor headspace was replaced by nitrogen gas."
3,Specific methanogenic activity of sludge and batch experiment,"2.2 Specific methanogenic activity of sludge and batch experiment The specific methanogenic activity (SMA) of sludge and batch experiments were all carried out in 120mL serum bottles using acetate, H2/CO2 and different amount of AE. In the SMA test, after the addition of 40mL sludge and 40mL nutrient solution containing trace element (as shown in Table 3 ), the serum bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and secured by aluminum crimp. Oxygen in headspace of the bottles was purged with nitrogen gas for 2min. Prior to use, the nutrient solution was boiled for 2h to remove any dissolved oxygen present and cool down to room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere. The initial COD concentration for the vials added with acetate was all 2000mg/L. For H2/CO2, the headspace of the bottle was replaced with pressurized gas of H2/CO2 (80:20, v/v) to get a final pressure of 1.4atm. Then, 1mL Na2S·9H2O (250mg/L as a final concentration in the vial), used as the reducing agent, was injected into each bottle to obtain an absolutely anaerobic condition. Finally, different amount of AE stock solution was added into the above bottles, which were placed and incubated in a water bath (100±1rpm) at 25±1°C. After each of the bottles reached the set temperature, the headspace was vented using a syringe to release the pressure caused by the thermal expansion. Biogas production and composition were measured every 3–5h according to the biogas volume, and expressed as the value at the standard state. Each experiment was conducted in two replicates to ensure its reliability. AE degradation kinetics was further investigated in the presence or absence of acetate, respectively. Biogas production and composition were measured every 4–6h. At the same time, 2.5mL of sample was withdrawn and centrifuged to remove sludge and AE concentration was then monitored. The other experimental procedure was the same as described above."
4,Inhibition model,"2.3 Inhibition model d M dt = V max 1 + ( I / K ni ) m k M max 1 + ( I / K si ) n – M + ( 1 - k ) ( M max - M ) k s 1 + ( I / K ci ) p + k M max 1 + ( I / K si ) n – M + ( 1 - k ) ( M max - M ) AnupdatingADM1 model was adapted to describe the non-competitive inhibitory effect of AE presentation on the SMA of sludge (Puyol et al., 2012): M represents the acetoclastic or hydrogenotrophic cumulative methane production, respectively (gCH4-CODL−1), k is the proportion factor for methanogenesis affected by the LAS. Thus, (1− k) is empirical factor which represent the methane produced before AE entering in contact with microorganisms. Mmax is the maximum quantities of methane produced (gCH4-CODL−1) and Vmax is the maximum methanogenic rates (gCH4-CODL−1 d−1). Ks is the Monod constant (gCH4-CODL−1) and I is the inhibitor concentration. While Kni is the non-competitive inhibition constant and Kci is the competitive inhibition constants. Ksi is the suicide or irreversible inhibition constant (mgAEL−1) and m, n, p are the inhibition factors for each type of inhibition. However, in this experiment, Ks can be considered as negligible with respect to Mmax and there was also no methane produced at the beginning, only the inhibition factor affecting Vmax is modifying the values of Ri in function of AE concentration. The above model could be then simplified to the following: d M dt = R i = V max [ 1 + ( I / K ni ) m ] The constants of Vmax, Kni and m were estimated by a non-linear fitting program using the Origin 8.5."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The pH, COD and BOD5 were measured according to the Japan Standard Testing Method for Wastewater (JSWA, 1997). The determination of AE was conducted with the formation of a colored iodine-micelle complex by absorptiometry (Ross and Olivier, 1959). The volatile fatty acids concentration was determined by gas chromatography (Agilent-6890) equipped with a DB-WAXetr capillary column (30m×0.53mm×1.0μm) and an FID detector. The biogas composition was measured by a gas chromatograph (SHIMADZU GC-8A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Since the SMP and EPS were both composed of carbohydrate and protein, their concentrations were obtained by measurement of carbohydrate and protein using a cation exchange resin (CER) (DOWEX R Marathon C, Na+ form, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) extraction method. The exchange resin (75g of CER/g VSS) was added to a 200mL sample and mixed at 600rpm for 2h at 4°C. The mixture was then centrifuged for 15min at 12,000g to remove the MLSS. The centrifuged supernatant of the sample, after CER addition, represented the sum of SMP and EPS. The obtained supernatant was then filtered through a 0.45μm filter. The carbohydrate and protein in filtrate were determined as representing the SMP and the difference between these measurements was the EPS concentration. Carbohydrate was measured using H2SO4/phenol oxidation and a colorimeter method. Protein was measured using the Folin/Ciocalteu method (Frølund et al., 1996). All analyses were conducted in two replicates. The data of AE degradation, methane production, VFA generation and SMA of sludge measurement were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test was applied for multiple comparison. A p value less than 5% was considered as statistically significant (Aydin et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2013). Membrane resistance was analyzed by Darcy’s law as follows: R t = R m + R c + R po + R pi = Δ P ν · J where Rt is the total hydraulic resistance, Rm is the membrane resistance, Rpo and Rpi are the pore blocking resistance derived from organic matter and inorganic matter respectively, Rc is the cake layer resistance, ΔP is the trans-membrane pressure, ν is the dynamic viscosity and J is the membrane flux. Each resistance value was determined using the same membrane module used in SAnMBR. The experimental procedure to determine each resistance value was as follows: (1) Rm was estimated by measuring the water flux of tap water; (2) Rt was evaluated by the final flux of biomass microfiltration; (3) the membrane surface was then flushed with tap water and cleaned with a sponge to remove the cake layer. After that, the tap water flux was measured again to obtain the resistance of Rm +Rpo +Rpi. (4) the membrane pore was cleaned with NaClO (chloride concentration of 0.1%) to remove the pore blocking substance. Also, the tap water flux was measured again to obtain the resistance of Rm +Rpi. From steps (1)–(4), Rt, Rm, Rpo, Rpi and Rc could be calculated."
6,Pyrosequencing,"2.5 Pyrosequencing Microbial DNA was directly extracted from samples with an Ultra Clean Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MO-BIO) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The modified forward primer 5∗CCTAYGGGRBGCASCAG-3∗ and a revise primer of 3∗GGACTACHVGGGTHTCTAAK5∗ targeting to the V3-V4 region were selected for the PCR-based Pyrosequencing method. Barcodes that were 6-base long were incorporated between the 454 adapter and the primer in order to distinguish each sample in the mixed reaction. The amplifications were run under the following cycling conditions: 5min initial denaturation at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 94°C for 30s, annealing at 55°C for 30s, extension at 72°C for 1min, and completed with a final extension at 72°C for 10min as described by the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA samples with different barcodes were mixed in equal concentration and sequenced by a sequencer of Roche 454 GS Junior System Brochure (454 Life Sciences/Roche Applied Biosystems, Nutley, NJ, USA). All the raw reads were treated with the 454 Pyrosequencing SOP compared with saliva and clustered by the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP). The reads selected above were all treated with chimera removal and linguine removal. Sequences were denoised using the ‘pre.cluster’ command in Mothur platform to remove sequences that are likely due to pyrosequencing errors. After the above filtration, taxonomic classification of the bacterial sequences of sample was carried out using the RDP Classifier. All the sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using a programme of Mothur and Qiime with standard operation procedure. Based on the grouping of unique OTUs, the frequency data for each distance level was used to construct rarefaction curves and the diversity indices. Sequences obtained in this study have been submitted in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank nucleotide sequence database under the following accession numbers: LC196194 to LC197146."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Influence of AE on SAnMBR in treatment of municipal wastewater,"3.1 Influence of AE on SAnMBR in treatment of municipal wastewater The continuous experiment was operated for a period of around 400days including three stages (Table 1) and experienced different AE concentrations. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) was curtailed stepwise from 24 to 12h with different COD loading rate. Fig. 1 showed the reactor performance in terms of COD removal, biogas production and pH over the experimental time. Obviously, the stable performance was achieved after 10days of operation. The COD concentration in effluent was 17.1mg/L with a removal efficiency of 96.8%. Shortening HRT from 24h to 12h had also no influence on the COD removal and the average effluent COD was still 15.2mg/L. Even when AE was present in the feed wastewater, there was also no significant effect on the SAnMBR performance. In this regard, the effluent COD was always below 20mg/L even at higher AE concentration of 50–200mg/L. The effect of AE on biogas production and effluent pH changes was also displayed in Fig. 1. During the whole operation time, methane was always the main component in biogas with a ratio of 81–84%. When HRT was fixed at 12h and increased AE concentration from 5 to 200mg/L, the biogas production rate increased gradually with 2.30, 2.38, 2.84, 3.27 and 4.25L/d in average (Table 4 ). A slight pH decrease appeared in the presence of AE especially in the phase of VII and phase VIII, which should be due to the formation of volatile fatty acids (data shown later). The complete removal of AE ranged from 5 to 200mg/L (Fig. S3) also indicated that AE was degraded and converted into methane efficiently during the treatment of AE containing wastewater by SAnMBR. However, the presence of AE will cause a higher membrane fouling rate (Fig. 2 ), in which a higher AE concentration generally resulted in a steeper jump of TMP and a faster membrane fouling rate. The production of soluble microbial products (SMP) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), as two key factors affecting membrane fouling, their formation was also studied. At HRT of 12h, their concentrations were 43.2, 132.6, 203.7, 472.8, 451.8mg/L and 126.4, 565.3, 1417, 1570 and 1019mg/L respectively when AE concentration was 0, 5, 10, 100 and 200mg/L (Table 4). The production rate of SMP and EPS increased with AE concentration and reached a relative stable value, besides that the ratio of protein to carbohydrate (P/C) did not change significantly with about 2–3 in SMP and 4 in EPS. Since the contribution of biomass multiplication was limited (SS/VSS concentration in reactor was almost the same during the whole stable operation period, Fig. 2), the biomass associated products (BAP) should play a more important role than the utilization associated products (UAP) in SMP accumulation, which was caused by the microbial self-protection behavior in coping with the AE presence (Aquino and Stuckey, 2004). Moreover, the membrane fouling mechanism by AE was also studied via the membrane cleaning and filtration resistances calculation (Fig. 3 ). The results indicated that cake layer (physically cleaned with sponge) and pore blocking (chemically cleaned with NaClO) played a key role in filtration behavior and membrane fouling compared with other inorganic foulants (citric acid cleaning). However, the contribution of cake layer to membrane fouling decreased from 81% (control) to 70.4% in the presence of AE, while the ratio of pore blocking resistance by organic substance increased from 17% to 24.7%. Due to the higher amount of EPS than SMP and the contribution of protein production instead of carbohydrate, hydrophobic protein EPS attached in membrane was responsible to the increased pore blocking and reduced membrane permeability (Arabi and Nakhla, 2008). As all known, membrane fouling caused by pore blocking was irreversible and it could be only removed by NaClO chemical cleaning rather that physical cleaning method. Hence, although AE had almost no effect on municipal wastewater treatment by SAnMBR, AE will indeed increase the membrane fouling rate and then add the cost of wastewater treatment."
9,AE degradation process and its influence on SMA of sludge,"3.2 AE degradation process and its influence on SMA of sludge Fig. 4 depicted the impact of AE on methane production and AE abatement in batch assays with different AE concentration in the range of 0–200mg/L with/without acetate (substrate). The corresponding removal efficiency of AE in different assays ranged from about 80% to 100% at the end of experiment depending on the used concentrations and reaction conditions. However, the removal pattern and time of obtaining reaction equilibrium were quite different. Obviously, the AE concentration decreased quickly at the initial 3h and then slowly in the presence of substrate. While it always decreased slowly with reaction time without substrate and higher AE concentration led to slower removal rate. Besides, the AE removal equilibrium could be quickly achieved at 18h of reaction with substrate while it needed about 72h to obtain the reaction equilibrium under the latter condition. The cumulative methane production (CMP) for each dose of AE tested (inset of Fig. 4) was further recorded and compared with control experiment (no AE). A dose effect was obviously found no matter substrate was present or not. Generally, the net methane yield always increased with the rising concentration of AE and much more amount of methane was produced with AE but the initial production rate was indeed decreased. However, compared with that without substrate, the CMP was much higher and lag-time was also shorter in the presence of substrate. The methanogens activities were effectively revived after a short period of acclimation depending on the AE concentrations applied, the adverse impact induced by AE ceased gradually and the generation of methane began to increase for the duration of experiment. The results indicated that AE was firstly adsorbed and then degraded into methane gas and the substrate such as acetate should provide the necessary energy for microorganism to degrade AE since the CMP was greatly inhibited without the aid of substrate. AE degradation under anaerobic condition was further confirmed by the results of volatile fatty acids (VFA) analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, acetic, propionic and butyric acid were all detected as main intermediates of AE degradation in the absence of substrate. When AE dosage was 50mg/L, the acetate and propionate concentration exhibited almost the same trend, which was a little higher than control experiment (AE=0mg/L). The concentration of propionate showed an increase and then decrease trend with a maximum at 24h. In contrast, the acetate and propionate concentration always accumulated and reached a steady state at 30h when AE amount was 200mg/L. While at AE dosage of 50 and 200mg/L, the butyric acid production achieved a platform (at 18h and 30h) of 0.045 and 0.105mg/L respectively. According to the literature (Huber et al., 2000), the AE degradation pathway in SAnMBR was hence updated (Fig. S4). The first step of anaerobic microbial attack on AE was the cleavage of the terminal EO unit by releasing C2 units stepwise such as acetaldehyde and ethylene glycol. Subsequently, dodecanol was oxidized into dodecanoic acid and was further converted into butyric and propionic acid. Thirdly, the released acetaldehyde and ethylene glycol were then transformed into acetic acid and ethanol. Methane as the final product was generated by metabolism. As shown in Fig. 5 , sludge taken from the reactor at the end of phase II and V (Table 1) was used to investigate the AE acclimation on SMA of sludge. Obviously, the acetoclastic methanogens were more sensitive to AE and predominant in reactor compared with hydrogenotrophic microorganism (in Fig. S5), no significant difference of hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity whether the sludge was acclimated by AE or not). Moreover, the chronic effect of AE (10mg/L, the reported concentration in sewage) on anaerobic microbes was definitely limited because the SMA was 0.22 and 0.225g CODCH4/g VSS·d, respectively (AE 0mg/L in Fig. 4). While the different AE influence patterns were found in short-term experiment. SMA of sludge decreased with AE dosage from the beginning to the end before acclimation, while a platform appeared after long-term acclimation. It did not change significantly until AE was beyond 100mg/L and then decreased with AE concentration (higher AE concentration may result in sludge deflocculation (Liu et al., 2012) and destroy the cell structure due to the continuous release of IPS). The non-competitive inhibition model was proven to be suitable to describe the AE effect on SMA of sludge (regression coefficients >0.73). IC10 and IC50, the inhibitory concentration that induce 10% and 50% inhibition on measured response of the microbial community, are commonly used parameter for inhibitory impact. Before and after the sludge acclimated by AE, the IC10 and IC50 were calculated as 22.37, 99.60mg/L and 52.34, 139.58mg/L, respectively. Although AE cannot enhance the SMA as LAS by the increase of substrate bioavailability via removing EPS outside the microbial or lowering the surface tension of sludge (Garcia et al., 2006). However, the microbial community structure of sludge should change by self-acclimation in response to the enhancement of AE tolerance ability of sludge (acute effect) after long-term acclimation."
10,Change of microbial community structure in response to AE,"3.3 Change of microbial community structure in response to AE The influence of AE on the microbial community structure after long-term acclimation was analyzed by 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing in SAnMBR on 75day (Control) and 350day (AE), which represented the different stages when AE was introduced into the system or not. As shown in Fig. 6 , an obvious difference of both the similarity and population distribution was observed when AE was present in feed wastewater. Most of the sequence reads affiliated to four major phyla: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Chloroflexi were reported as the main bacterial phyla in conventional anaerobic digesters (Sun et al., 2015). While compared with control, their separated ratios changed a lot due to the different adaptabilities to AE. For example, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria decreased from 26.15% (Control) and 10.15% in the presence of AE. In contrast, the population of Firmicutes, Chloroflexi and Bacteroidetes increased from 6.5%, 22.13% and 18.26% (Control) to 11.37%, 29.53% and 31.31%. It was reported that Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Firmicutes were the dominant phylum groups in nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPE) and nonylphenol (Gu et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015). Besides, Firmicutes was known to play a critical role in the anaerobic hydrolysis and acidification process (Zhou et al., 2015). Bacteroidetes has also been known as a group of fermentative bacteria in the acidogenic phase of the digestion process (Yang et al., 2014). It meant that the AE presence did not inhibit and even enhance the hydrolysis and acidification step in anaerobic process. Moreover, the increased abundance also indicated that AE was easily to be degraded and its negative effect on microbes could be alleviated by long-term acclimation. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S6, after long-term acclimation by AE, the dominant bacteria at Genus level were Lutispora, Lactonifactor, Ethanoligenens, Gelria and Saccharofermentans in Firmicutes compared with Sedimentibacter, Thermanaeromonas, Pelotomaculum, Saccharofermentans and Hydrogenoanaerobacterium in Control. The similar situation was found in Bacteroidetes. The population of Ornithobacterium, Niabella, Meniscus, Alkaliflexus and Fluviicola appeared while the number of Meniscus, Pedobacter, Paludibacter, Fluviicola, Thermonema and Flavobacterium decreased. It meant that the presence of AE affected the evolution of the structure of the bacterial community in SAnMBR. All the sequences of Archaea were obviously affiliated to Methanobacteria and Thermoplasmata groups at a class level (data no shown), in which the class of Methanobacteria accounted for 100% (Control) and 99.69% (AE) of the total reads, respectively. A deeper genus level analysis was then conducted to explore the similarity and difference between the archaeal communities. The total proportion of aceticlastic (Methanothrix) and hydrogenotrophic (Methanolinea, Methanospirillum and Methanoculleus) methanogens in control was 73.91% and 26.09%, respectively. The lower abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was because that H2 and CO2 can only generated from acetate cleavage in this experiment, while the aceticlastic methanogens could rapidly grow without strong competition (for acetate uptake). When SAnMBR was used to treat AE containing municipal wastewater, the distribution of aceticlastic methanogens (Methanothrix and Methanoregula) increased from 73.91% to 83.80%. Methanothrix, an acetotrophic non-hydrogen-oxidizing methane bacterium (Wu et al., 1987), its proportion decreased from 73.91% to 60.25% while another acidiphilic methanogen, Methanoregula was found (Bräuer et al., 2011) and occupied by 23.55% at 350day. The influence mechanism of AE was discussed based on the above results. It has been proven that the bacterial community in SAnMBR changed in response to the AE presence in wastewater. Compared with Control, the total difference in the dominant genus bacteria in the presence of AE may be responsible to the highly efficient treatment of AE containing municipal wastewater (Aydin et al., 2016). However, as depicted in Fig. 5, the SMA of sludge decreased quickly at a higher AE dosage (>100mg/L). The amphiphilic property of the surfactant was reported to affect the microbial activity by impairing the function and structure of cell membrane, and its toxic effect on the microbe was divided into two aspects: direct disruption of the cellular membrane and/or reactions of the surfactant with enzymes essential to cell functioning (Song and Bielefeldt, 2012; Lee et al., 2013). Hence, the negative effect of AE, especially the damage to methanogens structure was responsible to decrease of SMA of sludge."
11,Conclusion,"Long-term acclimation led to changes of bacterial community structure, which resulted in higher methane recovery efficiency in treatment of alcohol ethoxylates containing wastewater. The increased population of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes played a functional role in alcohol ethoxylates degradation while another aceticlastic methanogen, Methanoregula was responsible to the enhanced tolerance ability of sludge to AE. Although AE was efficiently degraded and converted into methane, it caused a higher membrane fouling rate due to the microbial self-protection behavior by releasing more amounts of SMP and EPS. It will increase the cost of wastewater treatment."
