0,Introduction,"The production of biodiesel, to replace depleted supplies of petroleum fuel, generates glycerol as a by-product [1,2]. Every 10 kg of biodiesel produces approximately 1 kg of glycerol [1]. Thus, an increase in biodiesel production results in an increase in the amount of waste glycerol and significantly decreases glycerol prices. In addition, an increase in biodiesel production would raise the problem of finding efficient treatment or utilization of waste glycerol. Glycerol is generally used in the chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, soap, food and beverage industries [3]. It can also be used as a feedstock to produce energy carrier such as hydrogen, ethanol, and methane [1,2]. In this research, waste glycerol was converted to hydrogen and ethanol to make use of this abundant waste product. Successful efforts for simultaneous production of hydrogen and ethanol by pure and mixed cultures from various kinds of substrate have been reported. These substrates include sucrose [4], xylose [5], mixed glucose/xylose [6], and glycerol [7]. However, there is still limited information on using waste glycerol to simultaneously produce hydrogen and ethanol. This combined production process (hydrogen and ethanol) provides higher energy yield when compared with either hydrogen or ethanol alone [5]. Hydrogen–ethanol producing bacteria are the key to the successful simultaneous fermentation of hydrogen and ethanol production. Previous research has focused on the use of mixed cultures or the isolation and identification of a microorganism's capability of producing either hydrogen or ethanol from glycerol [8]. For example, Clostridia sp., Enterobacter sp., Citrobacter sp., and Klebsiella sp. were reported to be capable of generating either hydrogen or ethanol from glycerol [7–10]. However, the information on the isolation and identification of a microorganism's capability of simultaneously producing hydrogen and ethanol is still limited. Therefore, one of the objectives of this research was to isolate and characterize the microorganisms that posses the ability to use waste glycerol as feedstock for the simultaneous production of hydrogen and ethanol. In order to maximize simultaneous production of hydrogen and ethanol from waste glycerol, optimized conditions of nutritional and environmental parameters such as pH, temperature, and substrate concentrations are needed [11–15]. Most optimization studies employed a conventional technique or so-called one-factor-at-a-time technique, which is laborious and time-consuming [15]. Moreover, it does not illustrate the interactive effects among the tested variables or quantify the optimal conditions. Therefore, statistical optimization methods such as response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design (CCD) and RSM with Box-Behnken design is used to overcome these disadvantages, which also minimize the error in determining parameters effects [5,11,15,16]. The most important physical parameters affecting hydrogen and ethanol production are initial pH and temperature. Within an appropriate range, an increase in initial pH and temperature could increase the growth and activity of microorganisms [14,15] as well as the activity of hydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, which are the enzymes responsible for hydrogen and ethanol production, respectively [16,17]. Due to the fact that waste glycerol is deficient in nitrogen, trace elements and vitamins, a supplementation of these essentials is needed in order to achieve the optimum growth of the bacteria, which in turn enhances the production of hydrogen and ethanol [13–16]. Accordingly, this study attempts to isolate, characterize and identify the microorganisms capable of simultaneously producing hydrogen and ethanol. Optimized environmental factors significantly affecting simultaneous hydrogen and ethanol production from waste glycerol by isolated bacteria were investigated by RSM with CCD in order to achieve maximum hydrogen production rate (HPR) and ethanol production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Substrates,"2.1 Substrates Pure glycerol (analytical grade) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich Co. LLC. Waste glycerol was obtained from the biodiesel production process of Krungtep Produce Public Company Limited, Saraburi Province, Thailand. The company produces fried chicken and generates approximately 202.60 tons/month of used oil during the production process with an average of 44,000 L of biodiesel as well as 4400 L of waste glycerol per month. Waste glycerol consists of (all in g/L): glycerol, 441.3; methanol, 230; NaCl, 10; total nitrogen, 0.5; and total phosphorus, 0.05."
3,Screening for hydrogen-ethanol producing bacteria,"2.2 Screening for hydrogen-ethanol producing bacteria Anaerobic sediment obtained from anaerobic ponds of Nakornphet Sugar Factory, Kamphaeng Phet Province, Thailand, was used as a bacterial source. The anaerobic pond treats wastewater from the sugar production process. The anaerobic sediment was pretreated at 105 °C in a hot air oven (LDO-100E, Daihan Labtech Co., Ltd., Korea) for 1 h to inactivate methanogenic bacteria. The pretreated sediment was then enriched in a 50 mL serum bottle containing 30 mL of enrichment media. The enrichment media was made up of 10 g of pretreated sediment and 30 mL of basic anaerobic medium (BA medium) [13] with 5 g/L of pure glycerol as a carbon source. The medium was adjusted to pH 6.50 using 4 mol/L NaOH or 5 mol/L HCl. The serum bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers, capped with an aluminum cap, and flushed with an 80/20% N2/CO2 gas mixture for 5 min to create an anaerobic condition. The serum bottles were incubated in an incubator at 37 °C. Every 3 days, 20 mL of fermentation broth was replaced with fresh BA medium. This process continued until no further increase in hydrogen and ethanol production was observed in comparison to the previous cultivation (7 times sub-culture). The final enrichment culture was serially diluted (10−1–10−9) in BA medium, solidified by 0.25% (w/v) agar and incubated anaerobically at 37 °C in an incubator for 2 days [18]. Single colonies from each dilution series were removed with sterile pasture pipettes, and transferred to sterilized BA medium containing 5 g/L of pure glycerol as a carbon source before being tested for their hydrogen and ethanol production performance. The isolate with the highest hydrogen and ethanol production was identified and biochemically characterized."
4,Strain identification and phylogenetic analysis,"2.3 Strain identification and phylogenetic analysis The total genomic DNA of a selected single colony obtained from screening step was lysed at 70 °C for 20 min in sterilized distilled water. The existence of extracted DNA was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. After DNA extraction, two steps of PCR amplification were employed. The first step PCR was conducted in order to increase the number of DNA templates using a universal primer set including forward primer 27-f (5′-GTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and reverse primer 1492-r (5′-CGGCTACCTTGTTACGAC-3′). PCR amplification was conducted in a T-gradient thermo cycler (Bimetra GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) using the following protocols: initial denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C; 37 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C; annealing for 25 s at 52 °C; extension for 1.5 min at 72 °C; followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. To carry out the DGGE analysis, a second PCR amplification was conducted to amplify the V3 region using the primer set of 357-f (5′-CGCCCGCCGCGCGCGGCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGGCCTACGGGAGGCGCAG-3′) and 518-r (5′-ATTACCGCGCTGCTGG-3′). PCR amplification was conducted in a T-gradient thermo cycler (Bimetra GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) using the following protocol: initial denaturation for 15 min at 94 °C; 19 cycles of denaturation for 1 s at 94 °C; annealing for 0.75 min at 65 °C; extension for 1 min at 72 °C; 9 cycles of denaturation for 1 s at 94 °C; annealing for 0.75 min at 55 °C; extension for 1 min at 72 °C; followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The DGGE analysis of the PCR products was performed using the method previously described by Sreela-Or et al. [19]. The bands corresponding to the products of the second PCR were excised from the DGGE gel and re-amplified with forward primer without the GC clamp and the reverse primer. Following re-amplification, the PCR products were purified and sequenced as previously described by O-thong et al. [20]. Closest matches for partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were identified by database searches in GenBank using BLAST [21]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method with MEGA 5 [22]. Bootstrapping analysis [23] for 1000 replicates was performed to estimate the confidence of tree topologies."
5,Morphological and biochemical test,"2.4 Morphological and biochemical test The morphology and characterization of the isolated microorganisms were analyzed according to Bergey's manual [24]. Gram staining was conducted by the Hucker method [25] and observed using a light microscope (Olympus BX51, Japan). To carry out biochemical characterization, different carbon sources, i.e., glucose, xylose, mixed glucose/xylose, gelatin, oil, pure glycerol, and waste glycerol were tested for hydrogen and ethanol production. The concentration of each substrate was 20 g/L. The initial pH and incubation temperature were 7.0 and 37 °C, respectively."
6,Optimization procedure,"2.5 Optimization procedure 2.5.1 Placket-Burman design A Placket-Burman design was used to screen and identify significant variables for HPR and ethanol production from waste glycerol by isolated microorganisms. Investigated parameters were initial pH, temperature, amount of vitamin solution, yeast extract (YE) concentration, and glycerol (contained in waste glycerol) concentration. The Placket-Burman design [26] is based on the first order model: (1) Y = β 0 + ∑ β i X i , where Y is the responses (HPR and ethanol production), β 0 is the model intercept, β i is the linear coefficient, and X i is the level of the independent variable. Each of variables in the Placket-Burman design was examined in two levels: −1 for low level and +1 for high level. The factors significant at the 95% level (p ≤ 0.05) were considered to have a significant effect on HPR and ethanol production and further used in the optimization procedure by CCD. Table 1 tabulates the high and low levels of each factor used in the Plackett-Burman design experiment. The effect of each variable was determined using the following equation: (2) E X i = 2 ( ∑ M i + − M i − ) / N , where EX i is the effect of the tested variable, M i+ and M i− are HPR and ethanol production from runs where the variable X i measured was present at the high and low concentration, respectively, and N is the number of runs (16). In order to maximize HPR and ethanol production, the next experiment was carried out using the CCD. 2.5.2 CCD CCD was used to optimize the effect of each significant variable on the responses, i.e., HPR and ethanol production. The statistical calculation, test factors of X i were coded as x i according to the following equation (3) x i = ( X i − X 0 ) / Δ X i , where x i is the coded value of the variable, X i is the actual value of the independent variable, X 0 is the actual value of X i at the center point and ΔX i is the step change value. The following quadratic model was used to optimize the key environmental factors. (4) Y = β 0 + ∑ β i X i + ∑ β i i X i 2 + ∑ β i j X i X j , where Y is the predicted responses (HPR and ethanol production), β 0 is a constant, β i is the linear coefficient, β ii is the squared coefficient, β ij is the interaction coefficient, and X i is the variable. The response variable (HPR and ethanol production) was fitted using a predictive polynomial quadratic equation (Eq. (4)) in order to correlate the response variable to the independent variables [27]. The statistical software Design-Expert (Demo version 7.0, Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used to design the experimental conditions. The conditions of each trial are shown in Table 2 ."
7,Biohydrogen and bioethanol production from waste glycerol,"2.6 Biohydrogen and bioethanol production from waste glycerol Biohydrogen and bioethanol production were conducted in 130 mL serum bottles with a 90 mL working volume using waste glycerol as substrate. The fermentation media was BA medium consisting of waste glycerol, amount of vitamins solution, YE, and 9 mL of inoculum (10% (v/v) inoculum size, OD 0.652, cell concentration 1.25 × 106 CFU/mL). Vitamins solution consist of (all in mg/L): biotin, 2; folic acid, 2; pyridoxine acid, 10; ridoflavin, 5; thiamine hydrochloride, 5; cyanocobalamine, 0.1; nicotinic acid, 5; P-aminobenzoic acid, 5; lipoic acid, 5; and dl-pantothenic acid, 5 [13]. The concentration of each media component was adjusted according to design (Tables 1 and 2). Waste glycerol contains a low concentration of total nitrogen (10–75 g/L of glycerol (contained in waste glycerol) equivalent to 0.79–22.06 mg/L of total nitrogen), therefore the concentration of nitrogen in waste glycerol was not taken into account. The initial pH of the fermentation medium was adjusted to between 3 and 12 using 2 mol/L HCl or 2 mol/L NaOH. The serum bottles were tightly sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum caps. They were then flushed with 80/20% N2/CO2 gas mixture to create anaerobic conditions. The serum bottles were incubated in a water bath at various temperatures (30–45 °C). During the incubation, the volume of biogas was measured by wetted glass syringe [28]. All treatments were conducted in triplicates. The fermentation process continued until no biogas was generated."
8,Analytical methods,"2.7 Analytical methods Biogas compositions including hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide were determined by gas chromatography (GC) equipped (MicroLab, Aarhus, Denmark) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and an s-m stainless Porapak Q column (50/80 mesh). Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas. GC-TCD condition was set according to Kongjan et al. [29]. The hydrogen production volume in biogas was calculated using the mass balance equation [30]. Cumulative volumetric hydrogen production was calculated using a modified Gompertz equation [31]. The molar amount of hydrogen production (HP) (mmol H2/L) was calculated using the ideal gas law as: cumulative volumetric hydrogen production (HP) (ml H2/L)/(RT), where R = 0.08205784 L atm/K mol, and T (K) = [273.15 + temperature in the unit of °C]. HPR was calculated by dividing the molar amount of hydrogen production (mmol H2/L) by incubation time (h). Hydrogen yield (mol H2/mol glycerol) was calculated by dividing the molar amount of hydrogen production (mol H2/L) by glycerol consumption (mol-glycerol/L). Ethanol yield was determined by dividing ethanol production (mmol/l) by glycerol consumption (mmol-glycerol/L). Before being analyzed for soluble metabolite products (SMPs), one mL of liquid sample was added to 0.1 mL 34% H3PO4 to precipitate the lipid residues and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant, 0.8 mL, was acidified with 0.2 mL of 2 mol/L oxalic acid. The samples were filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon membrane filter. Measurements of glycerol, 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (acetic, butyric, valeric, propionic, and hexanoic acids) and alcohol concentrations (ethanol, butanol) were performed on the resulting filtrate using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and GC. Concentrations of glycerol and 1,3-PD were determined by HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Science Park Scion DTU, Horsholm, Denmark) equipped with ultraviolet (UV) (210 nm) and refractive index (RI) detectors. A 7.80 × 300 mm Vertisep™ OA 8 μm column was used for the HPLC analysis. The HPLC conditions followed the method described by Selembo et al. [32]. VFAs and alcohols were analyzed using a GC (HP 5890 series II) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a stainless HP-FFAP column packed with nitroterephthalic acid modified polyethylene glycol (25 m × 0.20 mm × 0.3 μm, Agilent Technologies). The GC-FID conditions were set according to Liu et al. [33]. The detection limit for VFAs was 0.002% (w/v) and the detection limit for ethanol and butanol was 0.0094% (w/v). Cell concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance (OD600) of samples at 600 nm using the Camspec M550 double beam scanning UV/VIS spectrophotometer (The UK based laboratory Instrument Specialist, UK). The OD600 was transformed to the cell number and dry cell weight (DCW) concentration by the calibration of 1 unit of OD600 = 1.917 × 106 CFU/mL and 0.235 g-DCW/L, respectively."
9,Calculation of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) balance,"2.8 Calculation of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) balance The glycerol consumption and concentrations of each fermentative product were converted to the COD concentration (g-COD/L) following the method described by Adrianus and Jeroen [34]. The fermentative products included 1,3-PD, ethanol, butanol, acetic, butyric, valeric, propionic, and n-hexanoic acids. The COD distribution of each fermentative product was calculated by multiplying the COD concentration by 100 and then dividing by the COD concentration of glycerol consumed. The COD distribution for glycerol consumption was set to −100. The COD balance was then calculated as follows: (5) COD balance ( % ) = COD distribution of glycerol consumption + ∑ ( COD distribution of fermentative products )"
10,Results and discussion,
11,Characterization of hydrogen–ethanol producing bacteria,"3.1 Characterization of hydrogen–ethanol producing bacteria A total of four isolates showed the ability to simultaneously produce hydrogen and ethanol from waste glycerol. Among them, strain KKU-S1 showed the highest hydrogen and ethanol production of 31.57 mmol H2/L and 66.27 mmol/L, respectively. Therefore, strain KKU-S1 was selected as the inoculum to be used throughout this study. The morphology of strain KKU-S1 was 2.5 mm diameter, cream-colored, and round colonies as observed in the roll tubes. The strain KKU-S1 is a gram negative rod shaped bacteria as observed under the light microscope. The partial sequences of 16S rDNA (392 bp) of strain KKU-S1 were deposited in GenBanK (Accession no. JX424843). The 16S rDNA analysis indicated that strain KKU-S1 exhibited the highest similarity value of 99% to Enterobacter aerogenes strains HH150. The phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence placed strain KKU-S1 in the cluster comprising members of the genus Enterobacter (Fig. 1 ). E. aerogenes was reported to have the ability to simultaneously produce hydrogen and ethanol from various types of substrate including simple and complex carbohydrates [10,17], as well as glycerol [7,17]."
12,Biochemical tests,"3.2 Biochemical tests Various types of carbon source including glucose, xylose, mixed glucose/xylose, oil, gelatin, pure glycerol, waste glycerol were used to produce hydrogen and ethanol using E. aerogenes KKU-S1. The results indicated that the highest HP of 16 mmol/L was achieved when xylose was used as the carbon source while the maximum ethanol production of 96 mmol/L was obtained when waste glycerol was used as carbon source (Table 3 ). However, the highest simultaneous hydrogen and ethanol production of 14 mmol/L and 96 mmol/L respectively, were obtained when waste glycerol was used as carbon source. Results indicate that E. aerogenes KKU-S1 has the potential to produce hydrogen and ethanol simultaneously using waste glycerol as the carbon source (Table 3). Moreover, E. aerogenes KKU-S1 can also use simple sugar and mixed sugar as a carbon source to produce hydrogen and ethanol."
13,Screening of significance factors affecting HPR and ethanol production from waste glycerol by E. aerogenes KKU-S1,"3.3 Screening of significance factors affecting HPR and ethanol production from waste glycerol by E. aerogenes KKU-S1 A Placket-Burman design was used to screen the significant factors affecting HPR and ethanol production. The significance and effect of each variable on HPR and ethanol production are shown in Table 1. The effect of each variable was calculated by the difference between the averages of measurements made at the high and low level of the factor. The sign of the effect value (EX i ) shows the influences of the variable on hydrogen production. A negative sign indicates that the influence of the variable on HPR and ethanol production should be lower than the low level. In contrast, the positive sign indicates that the influence of the variable on HPR and ethanol production should be higher than the high level. The results indicated that the influence of initial pH, amount of vitamins solution and glycerol concentrations were greater at a high level while the influence of temperature and YE concentration were greater at a low level (Table 1). The significance of each variable was determined by the probability value (Table 1). The results also indicated that initial pH, temperature, YE concentration, and glycerol concentration had a significant effect on HPR and ethanol production (p ≤ 0.05). Therefore, these four variables were used in the next optimization step."
14,Optimization of environmental factors affecting HPR from waste glycerol by E. aerogenes KKU-S1,"3.4 Optimization of environmental factors affecting HPR from waste glycerol by E. aerogenes KKU-S1 The effects of initial pH (X 1), temperature (X 2), YE concentration (X 3), and glycerol concentration (X 4) on HPR were investigated. Regression analysis of the data from Table 2 resulted in the following quadratic equation (Eq. (6)) (6) Y HPR = 0.201 − 0.117 X 1 + 0.0016 X 2 + 0.0015 X 3 − 0.028 X 4 + 0.0010 X 1 X 2 + 0.0122 X 1 X 3 + 0.0294 X 1 X 4 + 0.0280 X 2 X 3 + 0.0200 X 2 X 4 + 0.00593 X 3 X 4 − 0.0907 X 1 2 + 0.0000676 X 2 2 − 0.0059 X 3 2 − 0.00089 X 4 2 The model presented a high determination coefficient (R 2 = 0.9838) explaining 99% of the variability in the response and a high value of the adjusted determination coefficient (adjusted R 2 = 0.99) suggesting a high significance of the model. A very low probability (p < 0.0001), obtained from the regression analysis of variance (ANOVA), demonstrated that the model was significant (Table 4 ). Linear terms of initial pH (X 1) and glycerol concentration (X 4) showed a significant individual effect on HPR (p ≤ 0.05). The quadratic model terms of initial pH (X 1 2) is highly significant (p < 0.0001). A significant interaction on HPR was found between the initial pH and glycerol concentration (X 1 X 4) as well as temperature and YE concentration (X 2 X 3) (p ≤ 0.05) (Table 4). The optimum conditions to maximize the HPR were calculated using Eq. (6). The maximum HPR of 0.34 mmol H2/L h was estimated at an initial pH 7.29, temperature 30 °C, YE concentration 0.10 g/L, and glycerol concentration 10.00 g/L. Response surface plots based on Eq. (6) with one variable kept constant at its optimum level, and varying the other two variables within the experimental range, are presented in Fig. 2 A–C. HPR decreased with an increase in initial pH greater than 7.29 and increased with a decrease in initial pH lower than 7.29 (Fig. 2A–C). Hence, a high initial pH causes low HPR due to the inhibited activity of hydrogenase enzymes in strong basic condition [14,35]. Generally, the appropriate range of initial pH for hydrogen production and cell growth of Enterobacter sp. is between 5.8 and 7.0 [17]. Therefore, if the initial pH of the substrate is outside the optimal range, and if not enough buffer capacity is present, the hydrogen production process will be inhibited [13,14]. Our results indicated that incubation temperature did not affect HPR (Fig. 2A). Temperature is reported to have an influence on the activities of hydrogen producers and fermentative of hydrogen production [13,14], which is in contrast to the findings in this research. Strain KKU-S1 was isolated from mesophilic temperature. Therefore, slight changes of the incubation temperature in the mesophilic range (around 30–37 °C) did not have any impact on the hydrogen production process. An increase or decrease in YE concentration did not affect HPR (Fig. 2B). YE was used as a nitrogen source for the microorganisms in the hydrogen fermentation. Results indicated that the total nitrogen contained in waste glycerol at the concentration used in the experiment was enough for the E. aerogenes KKU-S1 to produce biomass and hydrogen. Fig. 2C shows that an increase in glycerol concentration greater than 10 g/L resulted in a decrease in HPR. A high substrate concentration, not exceeding the substrate inhibition level, in the fermentation broth resulted in a high HPR because substrate was used to produce hydrogen [14]. An increase in the concentration of glycerol higher than optimum level might develop osmotic pressure inside the cells, which can cause cell damage due to the permeation of water molecules out of the cells [35]. Hence, production of hydrogen reduced at high substrate concentrations. Moreover, an increase in glycerol concentration, not beyond the substrate inhibition level, could increase carbon dioxide production. An accumulation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide higher than the volume of head space can cause the hydrogen and carbon dioxide to dissolve into liquid phase. When hydrogen and carbon dioxide accumulated in the liquid phase to some level, the hydrogen production will switch to solvent production, thus inhibiting the hydrogen production [36]."
15,Optimization of environmental factors affecting ethanol production from waste glycerol by E. aerogenes KKU-S1,"3.5 Optimization of environmental factors affecting ethanol production from waste glycerol by E. aerogenes KKU-S1 The effects of initial pH (X 1), temperature (X 2), YE concentration (X 3), and glycerol concentration (X 4) on ethanol were investigated. Regression analysis of the data from Table 3 resulted in the following quadratic equation (Eq. (7)) (7) Y EtOH = 109.52 − 41.51 X 1 − 0.494 X 2 + 2.683 X 3 + 5.065 X 4 − 2.957 X 1 X 2 − 0.923 X 1 X 3 + 3.067 X 1 X 4 + 5.275 X 2 X 3 + 4.057 X 2 X 4 − 3.237 X 3 X 4 − 45.061 X 1 2 − 3.602 X 2 2 − 8.242 X 3 2 − 15.616 X 4 2 The model presented a high determination coefficient (R 2 = 0.9883) explaining 98% of the variability in the response and a high value of the adjusted determination coefficient (adjusted R 2 = 0.99) suggested a high significance of the model. The very low probability (p < 0.0001) obtained from the regression of ANOVA demonstrated that the model was significant (Table 4). Linear terms of initial pH (X 1), and YE concentration (X 3) showed a significant individual effect on ethanol production (p ≤ 0.05). The quadratic model terms of initial pH (X 1 2), YE concentration (X 3 2), and glycerol concentration (X 4 2) are highly significant (p ≤ 0.05). The optimum conditions to maximize ethanol production were calculated using Eq. (7). The maximum ethanol production of 119.18 mmol/L was estimated at an initial pH 8.62, temperature 35 °C, YE concentration 0.72 g/L, and glycerol concentration 48.31 g/L. Response surface plots based on Eq. (7) with one variable kept constant at its optimum level, and varying the other two variables within the experimental range were presented in Fig. 3 A–F. Ethanol production increased with an increase in initial pH from 7.00 to 8.62 (Fig. 3A–C). An increase in initial pH greater than 8.62 resulted in a decrease in ethanol production (Fig. 3A–C). Initial pH is an important factor influencing the NADH/NAD ratio that affects the distribution of metabolic flux through the metabolites' routes in anaerobic conditions [17]. Therefore, controlling pH at optimum initial pH is necessary in order to obtain maximum ethanol production from waste glycerol by E. aerogenes KKU-S1. An increase in temperature from 30 to 35 °C resulted in an increase in ethanol production (Fig. 3A, D, E). However, ethanol production decreased with an increase in the temperature above 35 °C. These results suggested that an optimum temperature is needed for the growth and activity of E. aerogenes KKU-S1 to produce ethanol from waste glycerol. An increase in YE concentration from 0.00 to 0.72 g/L resulted in an increase in ethanol production (Fig. 3D, F). However, ethanol production decreased with a further increase in YE concentration above 0.72 g/L. YE contains an organic nitrogen source and important elements for the growth of microorganisms and alcohol dehydrogenase activity [17,37]. It also consists of important elements such as Mg+2, Fe+2, Zn+2, Cr+2, and Pb+2 [37]. Fe+2, Zn+2. Mg+2 is an important cofactor for the metabolic pathways of microorganisms that is known to influence the substrate uptake by microorganisms, which contributes to product yield [38]. Ethanol concentration was found to increase with an increase in glycerol concentration from 10 to 48.31 g/L. A further increase in glycerol concentration greater than 48.31 g/L resulted in a decrease in ethanol production. Substrate inhibition effect might be responsible for this finding [11,14] because the waste glycerol used in this study contains a high concentration of NaCl (10 g/L), which is toxic to microorganisms [3,38]. Therefore, a low production of ethanol occurred at high concentration of waste glycerol. It is important to mention that the experiment on yeast extract fermentation should be conducted to verify if the hydrogen and ethanol were from fermentation of glycerol or yeast extract or both. Based on the findings of O-thong et al. [39] that 1 g/L of YE generated a small amount of hydrogen and ethanol (0.02–0.05 mol H2/L and 0.01–0.05 mol EtOH/L, respectively), it is possible that hydrogen and ethanol were produced from yeast extract. However, the concentrations of yeast extract used in the experiment are very low (0–1.5 g/L), so a small amount of hydrogen and ethanol might be generated from yeast extract. For that reason, we could conclude that hydrogen and ethanol were mainly from the fermentation of glycerol."
16,Confirmation experiment,"3.6 Confirmation experiment The analysis of HPR and ethanol production (Eqs. (6) and (7)) model suggested that in order to obtain a simultaneously maximum HPR and ethanol production, initial pH, temperature, YE concentration, and glycerol concentration should be optimized at 8.14, 37 °C, 1.00 g/L, and 37 g/L, respectively. The HPR and ethanol production of 0.26 mmol H2/L h and 115 mmol/L were predicted under the optimum conditions (Table 5 ). Three replications of batch fermentation experiments under the optimum conditions were conducted to confirm the model validity. HPR and ethanol production of 0.24 mmol H2/L h and 120 mmol/L were obtained in the confirmation experiment. The results indicated that the observed HPR and ethanol production of 0.24 mmol H2/L h and 120 mmol/L, respectively, are in close agreement with the predicted values of HPR and ethanol production with a difference of 7.69 and 4.17%, respectively. Therefore, the model obtained from CCD experiment is valid. Under the optimum conditions, the hydrogen and ethanol yields were 0.12 mol H2/mol glycerol and 0.83 mol EtOH/mol glycerol, respectively. In comparison to the other studies, we found that our hydrogen yield of 0.12 mol H2/mol glycerol was relatively low whereas the maximum ethanol yield of 0.83 mol EtOH/mol glycerol was considered fairly high (Table 6 ). It is worth noting that it is difficult to compare our results to the other literature search due to the different in type and concentration of substrate, types of inoculum, cultivation and fermentation conditions, and nutrients used."
17,SMPs and COD balance,"3.7 SMPs and COD balance SMPs and COD balance at the end of the fermentation process in the confirmation experiment are tabulated in Tables 5 and 7 . The COD balance ranges from 0.8% to 10.8% error indicating that the measurements of SMPs were quite accurate. Under the optimum conditions, the yield of hydrogen and ethanol based on COD were 1.54% and 62.3%, respectively. The main SMPs at the low, center point, high, and optimum conditions were ethanol with yields of 83.1%, 65.5%, 64.4%, and 62.3%, respectively (based on COD). The minor metabolites (based on COD) at the low, center point, high, and optimum conditions were 1,3-PD, propionic acid, 1-propanol, acetic acid, butyric acid and biomass. There are two metabolic pathways of glycerol degradation i.e., oxidative and reductive pathways. In the reductive pathway, glycerol is reduced to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde and then to 1,3-PD with no generation of hydrogen. In the oxidative pathway, glycerol converts to pyruvate and further cleavage into two pathways. First, pyruvate converts to acetyl-CoA and formate, which yielded one mol of hydrogen. Second, pyruvate converted to lactic acid with no hydrogen being produced [38]. Acetyl-CoA is further converted to ethanol, acetate, butyrate and butanol. In general, both pathways simultaneously occur during hydrogen fermentation from glycerol. During the growth of microorganisms, the reduction state of carbon in biomass is higher than in glycerol, generating NADH as a result. NADH is used in the reductive pathway to produce 1,3-PD. At the same time, ATP obtained from the oxidative pathway is used by microorganisms for biomass production [10,38,40]. Therefore, a high yield of ethanol (based on COD) indicated that the main metabolic pathway of glycerol fermentation by E. aerogenes KKU-S1 was the oxidative pathway. A high ethanol yield present in the fermentation system indicated that E. aerogenes KKU-S1 consumed NADH generated from the biomass production process as a reductant for converted pyruvate to ethanol in the glycerol fermentation process [10,17]. The process of fermentation of glycerol is controlled by the NADH/NAD ratio. In Enterobacter sp., NADH is usually used as the reductant for the production of 1,3-PD from glycerol, and 2,3-butanediol, ethanol, lactate from pyruvate, but it is not used for hydrogen production. In these bacteria, hydrogen is produced by hydrogenase from formate, which is generated by splitting pyruvate via pyruvate-formate lyase. To split pyruvate to formate, NAD was used as an oxidant. Therefore, control of the NADH/NAD ratio (intracellular redox state) is important for hydrogen and ethanol production from waste glycerol [17]."
18,Energy conversion efficiency and process performance,"3.8 Energy conversion efficiency and process performance The energy conversion efficiency from the fermentation process was calculated based on the value obtained under the optimum conditions. In this study, the total energy efficiency of glycerol was calculated based on heat from the combustion of glycerol, hydrogen and ethanol and was 1674, 285, and 1377 kJ/mol, respectively. Under the optimum conditions, the maximum hydrogen and ethanol yields were 0.12 mol H2/mol glycerol and 0.83 mol ethanol/mol glycerol, respectively. Based on these information, the energy conversion efficiency for hydrogen was [(0.12 × 285)/1674] × 100% = 2.09%, and for ethanol was [(0.83 × 1377)/1674] × 100% = 68.37%. As a result, the total energy conversion efficiency was 70.46%. Our results suggested that the combined hydrogen and ethanol production has more advantages in terms of energy conversion efficiency when compared to either hydrogen or ethanol alone [6]."
19,Conclusions,"E. aerogenes KKU-S1 was isolated from anaerobic sediment. The strain KKU-S1 efficiently used glucose, xylose, mixed glucose/xylose, pure glycerol, and waste glycerol for simultaneously hydrogen and ethanol production. Experimental results indicated that initial pH, temperature, YE concentration, and glycerol concentration had a statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) effect on HPR and ethanol production. Optimum conditions for simultaneously maximizing HPR and ethanol production were initial pH of 8.14, temperature of 37 °C, YE concentration of 1.00 g/L, and glycerol concentration of 37 g/L, in which a maximum HPR and ethanol production of 0.24 mmol H2/L h and 120 mmol/L were observed. The total energy conversion efficiency suggested that a co-production of hydrogen and ethanol is an attractive and sustainable way to improve economic feasibility of waste glycerol from biodiesel production process. Results from this study not only reduce the amount of waste glycerol but also add value to waste glycerol by converting them to hydrogen and ethanol. In addition, the information obtained would pave the way for a future development of the simultaneously continuous hydrogen and ethanol production process from waste glycerol by E. aerogenes KKU-S1."
