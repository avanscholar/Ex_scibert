0,Introduction,"To struggle against booming energy demand and dwindling fossil fuel resources, shifting to alternative clean energy supplies has become even more interesting not only to hedge the energy uncertainty risk but also provide prosperity of environmental-conscious economy. Alcohol fuels, especially ethanol and higher alcohols (HAs or C2+OH) have received extensive attention as renewable fuels owning to their high energy content and compatibility with the existing storage and transportable infrastructure. They also hold potential as a hydrogen carrier in fuel cell systems and can be used as intermediates for many value-added products. Concerning the deteriorating environmental issues impacted by CO2 build-up, recycling of CO2 to high-value drop-in chemicals and fuels in particular is a promising strategy in the carbon-neutral perspective [1–4]. Many research efforts have been taken to develop catalysts for ethanol and HAs synthesis from syngas [5–11]. Still, it has rarely been reported in CO2 hydrogenation and achieving high productivity of alcohols with two or more carbon atoms remains an ongoing challenge [12–16] The catalyst capable of both i) non-dissociative CO activation and insertion, and ii) CO dissociative activation and carbon chain propagation was proved to be effective for HAs synthesis from syngas conversion, and the C − C coupling is a crucial prerequisite for accomplishing selective formation of higher alcohols [13,17–18]. For CO2 hydrogenation, the HAs synthesis proceeds through formation of CO intermediate by Reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction and subsequent CO addition into surface alkyl intermediates (CxHy), which are successively hydrogenated to mixed alcohols. In the past decades, the mechanistic insights into the HAs synthesis by CO/CO2 hydrogenation are mainly focused on the catalysts integrating methanol synthesis and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis abilities, e.g., Cu-Co [11,19–22] and Cu-Fe [23–25] based catalysts. In addition, monometallic catalysts with different metal species such as Co0–Coδ+ [26,27] and Rh0–Rh+ [28] are also reported as a promising catalyst for converting CO2/CO and H2 to C2+OH. Recently, In2O3 has demonstrated a high activity for methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation with excellent stability arising from the oxide nature of the active phase [29–33]. A significantly enhanced catalytic performance has been achieved by metal/metal oxide promotion, which provides active sites for H2 dissociation and interfacial sites for CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation [34–37]. So far, however, ethanol and HAs synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation over In2O3 catalyst has been unprecedented. Considering an outstanding ability to activate CO2, we were inspired to fine-tune complementary catalytic functionalities of In2O3 for HAs synthesis. Herein, we successfully realized the selective synthesis of ethanol and HAs from CO2 hydrogenation by modifying In2O3 catalyst with K and Co."

2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Indium (III) nitrate hydrate (In(NO3)3·xH2O, Aldrich, 99.99%), ethanol (CH3CH2OH, QRëC, 99.9%), ammonium hydroxide solution (NH4OH, Macron, 28–30 wt% NH3 in H2O), cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, QRëC, ≥ 98%) and potassium nitrate (KNO3, Ajax Finechem."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation 2.2.1 Preparation of In2O3 catalyst In2O3 was prepared by a precipitation method using indium nitrate and NH4OH as precursor and precipitating agent, respectively. Firstly, 3 g of In(NO3)3·xH2O was dissolved in a mixture of deionized water and ethanol. Then, a mixed solution containing NH4OH and ethanol was added dropwise into the previous solution under constant stirring at room temperature until achieving a pH ∼ 10. After aging for 30 min, the obtained precipitate was collected by filtration, followed by washing with ethanol, drying at 80 °C overnight and then calcination in air at 450 °C for 2 h. 2.2.2 Preparation of K- or Co-promoted In2O3 The K- or Co-promoted In2O3 catalyst was prepared by impregnating In2O3 (1 g) in a desired amount of KNO3 or Co(NO3)2·6H2O solution. Afterwards, the slurry was stirred at 60 °C for at least 2 h and then dried at 100 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, the K-In2O3 or Co-In2O3 samples were obtained by calcining at 400 °C for 2 h. 2.2.3 Preparation of Co-K-promoted In2O3 The dried K-In2O3 sample was further impregnated with Co(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous solution, and then stirred at 60 °C for 2 h. After drying at 100 °C for 24 h, the sample was calcined at 400 °C for 2 h. The resulting catalysts are denoted as xKyCo-In2O3, where x and y represent the weight percent of K and Co, respectively."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed on a Bruker D-8 Advance diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154060 nm), acquiring data in the 2θ range of 10 to 75° with a step size of 0.02°. The textural properties of the catalysts were measured using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms by a Micromeritics 3Flex surface analyzer at − 196 °C. The sample was vacuum dried at 200 °C for 12 h prior to measurement. The surface area was elaborated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the pore volume and pore diameter were gained through the Barrett–Joyher–Halenda (BJH) equation (Figure S1 and Table S1). The elemental analysis of catalysts was performed by using an inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES, Optima 4300 DV, Perkin-Elmer) to confirm the metal compositions. The final metal compositions were found to close to the starting metal compositions (Table S2). H2-TPD experiments were carried out to investigate the interaction of adsorbed H with catalysts surface. Before the tests, 20 mg of sample was in-situ reduced with 10% H2/Ar (50 mL min−1) at 380 °C for 2 h. After cooling to 50 °C under a flow of Ar gas, a feed stream containing 10%H2 in Ar (50 mL min−1) was passed through the catalyst bed for 1 h. Subsequently, the catalyst was kept under an Ar flow at the same temperature for 1 h to remove physically adsorbed molecules. After that, the TPD program was started by raising the temperature up to 600 °C under Ar flow (50 mL min−1) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a PHI5000 Versa Probe II (ULVAC-PHI Inc., Japan) at the SUT-NANOTEC-SLRI joint research facility, Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI), Thailand. A monochromatic Al-Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation source was used as the excitation source. All binding energies of the samples were calibrated using the reference carbon (C 1 s) peak at 284.8 eV. In situ XANES and EXAFS at the In L3-edge and Co K-edge were acquired on the beamline 5.2 at the Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI; public organization, Thailand). The data was collected in the fluorescent mode for In L3-edge and in the transmission mode for Co K-edge with an electron energy of 1.2 GeV and a ring current of 80–150 mA. Incident photon energy was set by step-scanning the Si (111) double-crystal monochromator. Spectra of the In and Co foils were simultaneously measured for energy calibration. In brief, the sample underwent pretreatment in situ from 30 to 150 °C under He flow (30 mL min−1) and holding at that temperature for 30 °C, and then heated in 66.7% H2 + 33.3% He stream (30 mL min−1) to 300 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1, held for 2 h, and then heated up again to 340 °C and 380 °C, respectively. The XAS spectra were continuously recorded during the reduction period and analyzed by Athena software package."
5,Catalytic testing,"2.4 Catalytic testing The CO2 hydrogenation to HAs over unpromoted and promoted In2O3 samples was executed in a high-pressure fixed-bed reactor. Prior to reaction, 1.0 g of the catalyst mixed with 1.0 g of SiO2 sand was placed at the center of stainless-steel tube, and reduced in situ with H2 (60 mL min−1) at 380 °C for 2 h under atmospheric pressure. After that, the reactant gas mixture with a CO2/H2/N2 ratio of 1/3/1 (37.5 mL min−1) was introduced into the reactor, and the pressure gradually raised to 4 MPa. The effluent gases were analyzed by an Agilent 7820 A gas chromatograph equipped with a Thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A HayeSep Q column was used for the CO2 separation and a Molecular sieve 5 Å stationary phase was employed for the quantification of CO, H2 and N2. The qualitative analysis of gas-phase C1–C4 hydrocarbon, oxygenated products and C5–C18 ranged hydrocarbons was performed with a Shimadzu GC-8A equipped with a Flame ionization detector (FID), using a Porapak-Q column (C1-C4 hydrocarbon + oxygenated) and OV-1 column (C5-C18 hydrocarbon), respectively. The CO2 conversion, selectivity toward the products, space–time yield (STY) of alcohols and weight fraction of C2+OH in total alcohols (C2+OH/ROH) were calculated on a carbon atom basis according to the following Eqs. (1)–(6): (1) CO 2 conversion (\%) = n products × 100 n products + n CO 2 ,out (2) n products = n CO,out + ∑ n C i × i (3) Selectivity of CO (\%) = n CO,out × 100 n products (4) Selectivity C i (\%) = n C i × i × 100 n products (5) STY C i (g kg cat - 1 h - 1 ) = F CO 2 ,in x CO 2 conversion x selectivity C i x MW C i M cat (6) C 2 + OH/ROH = ∑ i = 2 4 m C i × 100 ∑ i = 1 4 m C i where n is the moles of total products, CO2 and CO at outlet of the reactor, and product Ci (hydrocarbon or alcohol) containing i carbon atoms, FCO2,in is molar flow rate of CO2 (expressed in mol h−1), MWCi is molecular weight of alcohols containing i carbon atoms, Mcat is the mass of the catalyst and mCi is the weight of a certain alcohol in the products."
6,Results and discussion,"Catalytic performance for CO2 hydrogenation over unpromoted and promoted In2O3 samples evaluated at 380 °C and 4 MPa (CO2/H2/N2 = 1/3/1 and total flow of 37.5 mL min−1) are shown in Fig. 1 . The bare In2O3 catalyst exhibited CO2 conversion and selectivities towards CO and hydrocarbon + oxygenated products of 36.6%, 95.8% and 4.2%, respectively (Fig. 1a). The hydrocarbon and oxygenated distribution of the bare In2O3 catalyst is displayed in Fig. 1b. CH4 (84.4%) was dominant product with a small fraction of C2+HC, while only C1OH was produced as the oxygenated product. Doping of K, Co and the combination of K and Co into In2O3 did not significantly affect the CO2 conversion (Fig. 1a). The raw data were checked and we found that the hydrocarbon and oxygenated products were formed in an expense of CO. Therefore, the almost constant CO2 conversion of modified In2O3 compared to bare In2O3 could be attributed to the transformation of produced CO to hydrocarbon and oxygenated products. The addition of K, Co and the combination of K and Co into In2O3 was found to greatly alter the products selectivity. For the 2.5 K-In2O3 catalyst, the CO selectivity increased up to 99.7%, while the hydrocarbon and oxygenated selectivity reduced to 2.3%. In comparison to the bare In2O3 catalyst (Fig. 1b), the 2.5 K-In2O3 significantly reduced the CH4 product, suggesting that the role of K-promoted In2O3 was associated with the retardation of CH4 formation. In addition, there were no C2+ hydrocarbon and C2+ oxygenated products formed over the K-promoted In2O3. Adding Co into In2O3 (5Co-In2O3) increased a portion of C2+ hydrocarbon and produced a small amount of C2OH (Fig. 1b). The selectivity of hydrocarbon + oxygenated products, higher alcohols and hydrocarbon distributions over 5Co-In2O3 were 4.8%, 0.6% and 91.4%, respectively. Interestingly, the combination of In2O3 with Co and K increased the selectivity towards to hydrocarbon + oxygenated products to 6.2%, 9.9% and 19.2% for 1K2Co-In2O3, 2.5 K2.5Co-In2O3 and 2.5K5Co-In2O3 (Fig. 1a), respectively. More importantly, the higher alcohols (C2+OH) distribution increased to 28.5%, 41.0%, and 57.9%, while the hydrocarbon products (CH4 and C2+HC) decreased to 58.5%, 48.2% and 33.9% for 1K2Co-In2O3, 2.5 K2.5Co-In2O3 and 2.5K5Co-In2O3, respectively. The results suggest that there is a synergy effect between K, Co and In2O3 which prefers to produce higher alcohols rather than hydrocarbon products. Overall, the 2.5K5Co-In2O3 catalyst showed the maximum C2+OH space time yield of 169.6 g kgcat −1h−1 with a mass fraction of C2+OH in the total alcohols of 87.4%. It is noteworthy that the STY of C2+OH over the 2.5K5Co-In2O3 exceeds that of other advanced catalysts reported so far (Table S3). The structural investigation of catalysts was conducted to realize how the addition of both K and Co into In2O3 enhanced the higher alcohols formation. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern revealed that the cubic In2O3 was the predominant structure in the calcined In2O3 sample (Fig. 2 ). Doping with promoters (2.5 wt% K, 5 wt% Co, 2.5 wt% K and 2.5 wt% Co and 2.5 wt% K and 5 wt% Co) did not alter the crystal structure of In2O3. The absence of K and Co related compounds in the XRD patterns suggested their high dispersion on In2O3 surface and either the low metal loading. The XRD pattern of the reduced 2.5K5Co-In2O3 catalyst remained unchanged compared to that of the calcined 2.5K5Co-In2O3 catalyst. The structure of Co and In in 5Co-In2O3 and 2.5K5Co-In2O3 catalysts during the pretreatment with He from 30 °C to 150 °C followed by the reduction with H2 (66.7% H2 balanced with He) from 150 °C to 380 °C was further investigated with the in-situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). As shown in Fig. 3 a, the Co-K edge XANES spectra of 5Co-In2O3 sample pre-treated with He at 30 °C and 150 °C revealed that the structure of Co was predominantly in the form of Co3O4. Subsequent to switching the gas and rising the reduction temperature to 300 °C, the edge position is shifted towards lower energy suggesting a lowering the oxidation state of Co species. At the reduction temperature of 340–380 °C, the XANES spectra resembled a mixture of CoO and Co0. Fig. 3b shows a Linear combination fitting (LCF) of the XANES spectra which suggests that Co3O4 phase is completely converted to the mixture of CoO and Co0 at 300 °C and the amount of Co0 increased to approximately 67% at 380 °C. The Fourier transformation of in-situ EXAFS signals in r-space (Fig. 3c) of the 5Co-In2O3 sample at Room temperature (RT) pretreated with He exhibited two peaks at around 1.43 Å and 2.56 Å (not corrected by phase-shift) attributed to Co-O coordination shell and Co-Co coordination shell, respectively. The peak intensity of Co-O became less pronounced accompanied by the increase of peak intensity of Co-Co for the sample after the reduction at 300 °C. The EXAFS spectrum at 340 °C and 380 °C displayed one prominent Co-Co peak similar to that of Co foil reference, suggesting that Co was mainly present as the Co0 state for 5Co-In2O3 sample. The XANES spectra below 300 °C and 300–340 °C of 2.5K5Co-In2O3 (Fig. 4 a) resembled Co3O4 and a mixture of CoO and Co, respectively which were similar to 5Co-In2O3 sample. At 380 °C, the main edge was closed to that of Co foil reference. However, its feature was quite different compared to that of Co foil. The linear combination fitting suggested that Co0 became more dominant phase at higher reduction temperatures (Fig. 4b). The EXAFS analysis in r-space (Fig. 4c) revealed that, with increasing the reduction temperature, the intensity of CoO bond was reduced while the CoCo bond distance decreased approached to the CoCo bond distance of Co foil. However, the EXAFS spectrum after the reduction at 380 °C did not resemble to that of Co foil reference (Fig. 4c) as we can see a shoulder signal at bond distance of 3 Å, implying that the presence of K in 2.5K5Co-In2O3 catalyst may involve in the structure of Co. In order to confirm the Co-K path in catalyst structure. We employ the KCoO2 as representative model of existence Co-K path. The EXAFS spectrum with the theoretical fits using KCoO2 model is presented in Fig. 4d and the fitting results is given in Table 1 . The EXAFS fitting indicated that the Co-K path significantly contributed to the EXAFS spectrum of 2.5K5Co-In2O3. Based on the XANES and EXAFS analyses, it is postulated that Co3O4 was reduced to a mixture of CoO and Co0, and Co0 was interacted with K-O to form Co-O-K guided by KCoO2 model. The surface chemistry of 2.5K5Co-In2O3 sample after calcination and reduction at 380 °C was studied with the XPS technique. The Co 2p3/2 XPS spectrum (Fig. 5 a) of calcined sample displayed a position at 779.2 eV which could be attributed to the presence of Co3O4 as indicated by XANES analysis (Fig. 4). After the reduction with H2 at 380 °C for 2 h, the main Co 2p3/2 peak shifted to 780.0 eV compared to 779.2 eV of the calcined sample (+0.8 eV) and there was no evidence of Co0 characteristic. Based on electron donor-electron acceptor theory, the formation of CoK bond was not the case as Co had a stronger electron withdrawing ability than K, decreasing binding energy. The increased binding energy of the Co 2p3/2 indicated that Co atoms were more ionically bonded to O-K than to oxygen in CoO, i.e., K-O-Coδ+-O-K. The similar behavior was observed for Pd or Pt supported zeolite materials which showed a positive shift in XPS spectrum arising from the donation of electron from the surface of metals to the zeolite, generating metal δ+ in cationic sites. [38]. Fig. 5b showed the K 2p XPS spectrum of calcined and reduced 2.5K5Co-In2O3 samples. The K 2p XPS spectrum of both samples can be fitted into four peaks centered at 292.5 eV (K 2p3/2), 293.5 eV (K 2p3/2), 295.3 eV (K 2p1/2) and 296.3 eV (K 2p1/2). The FTIR analysis (Figure S2) confirmed that KNO3 was present in the structure of calcined 2.5K5Co-In2O3 sample and the significant reduction of NO3 − was observed after reduction. Due to the higher peak intensity of the K 2p3/2 and K 2p1/2 at 293.5 and 296.3 eV of the calcined sample, those spectra could be assigned to K-O-N of KNO3. After reduction, the NOx compounds were removed from the catalyst surface, while active Co atoms were generated, and then migrated to the neighboring K-O to form K-O-Co. Since the electronegativity of Co had lower than that of N, the K 2p XPS spectra of K-O-Co appeared at lower binding energies compared to those of K-O-N. The In 3d XPS spectrum of calcined and reduced 2.5K5Co-In2O3 samples displayed the peaks at the identical binding energies (Fig. 5c), indicating that In was predominantly present as In2O3 corresponding to the XRD analysis (Fig. 2). The O 1 s XPS spectrum of calcined and reduced 2.5K5Co-In2O3 samples could be fitted into three peaks at low (529.6 and 529.7 eV), medium (531.3 and 531.2 eV) and high binding energies (532.6 and 532.5 eV) which could be assigned to O2− ions of crystalline network (lattice oxygen), oxygen atoms bonded to cations in the non-stoichiometric oxidation state (oxygen-deficient regions) and surface chemisorbed oxygen species such as hydroxy groups, respectively [39]. Clearly, the amount of oxygen defects greatly increased from 18.71% to 40.04% after reduction process which could be attributed to a loss of oxygen atoms from the surface of In2O3 [29,40–42]. In addition, the removal of NOx from the surface of KNO3 and the formation of non-stoichiometric KCoOx could not be ruled out. The desorption characteristics of H2 with the catalysts surface were studied by H2-TPD; the results are shown in Fig. 6 . The In2O3 sample exhibited two H2 desorption peaks (Fig. 6a) at 170 °C and 240 °C which could be assigned to weak and medium H2 adsorption on oxygen vacancies formed by H2 reduction (Ov2) and thermal-induced oxygen vacancy sites (Ov1), respectively [29,30]. Adding K into In2O3 (2.5 K-In2O3) significantly reduced the H2 desorption peaks intensity in the range of 100–300 °C but an additional peak centered at 412 °C was found instead, which could be attributed to a block of defect sites of In2O3 by K oxides deposition, and the adsorption of H2 on K-O sites, respectively. Doping Co into In2O3 (5Co-In2O3) slightly deducted the weak and medium H2 adsorption. The combination of Co and K with In2O3 (2.5K5Co-In2O3) remarkably reduced the weak H2 adsorption but enhanced a strong H2 adsorption as the appearance of desorption peak at 346 °C. The interaction of H2 with the surface of 2.5K5Co-In2O3 was stronger than 5Co-In2O3 but weaker than 2.5 K-In2O3 which was associated with the formation of K-O-Co. The mechanism for CO2 hydrogenation over In2O3 and In2O3-based catalysts is proposed based on the characterization results and the catalytic performance. As shown in Fig. 1, the bare In2O3 catalyst produces CO as the major product (SCo = 96%), indicating that CO2 is mainly converted to CO on the surface of In2O3 which then desorbs from its surface. Note that a small amount of CH4 was detected as a hydrocarbon product (Fig. 1b) which could be formed via hydrogenolysis of CH3OH to CH4 and CO methanation [43]. Adding K into In2O3 (2.5 K-In2O3) turns the catalyst to be very selective for CO formation (SCo = 99.7%). In addition, CH3OH is predominant in the hydrocarbon and oxygenated products because the presence of K greatly diminishes the weak and medium H2 adsorption which inhibits the hydrogenation of CH3OH and CO to CH4. 5Co-In2O3 catalyst can produce both C2+HC and C2+OH products but the C2+HC product is more favored than C2+OH product. As confirmed by in-situ XANES, Co species of 5Co-In2O3 predominantly form as the mixture of Co0 and CoO, while In species is present as In2O3 with surface oxygen defect. The surface oxygen defect of In2O3 converts CO2 to CO. The Co0 site is involved in the dissociative adsorption of C-O, C–C chain growth and the hydrogenation of adsorbed carbon to form CxHy* species. The CO* on the surface of CoO is migrated and is inserted into the adjacent CxHy* species adsorbed on Co0 sites, resulting in the formation of C2+OH. The higher fraction of hydrocarbon products than the oxygenated products is attributed to the faster hydrogenation of CxHy* species than the CO insertion due to the presence of weak H adsorption. In contrast to 5Co-In2O3 catalyst, the addition of both Co and K into In2O3 leads to the formation of K-O-Co which considerably reduced the weakly adsorbed H species and strengthened H adatom with the catalyst surface (Fig. 6), suppressing the hydrogenation ability of the catalyst to hydrogenate alkyl intermediates to form hydrocarbon products and improving C–C chain growth and CO insertion, resulting in the higher production of higher alcohols. The schematic illustration for CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbon and oxygenated products over 5Co-In2O3 and 2.5K5Co-In2O3 is presented in Fig. 7 . Fig. 8 shows the effect of reaction temperature on the CO2 hydrogenation to higher alcohols over 2.5K5Co-In2O3 catalyst. At 260–300 °C, the 2.5K5Co-In2O3 provided less than 10% CO2 conversions (Fig. 8a) and produced a tiny C2+OH yield (Fig. 8b). The low activity of 2.5K5Co-In2O3 catalyst at low reaction temperatures was attributed to the strong interaction of adsorbed H with the catalyst surface. When the reaction temperature increased higher than 300 °C, the CO2 conversion remarkably enhanced with a higher fraction of hydrocarbon + oxygenated products (Fig. 8a). In addition, the C2+OH became the predominant product, suggesting that the formation of higher alcohols was kinetically favored at higher temperatures. The long-term stability of 2.5K5Co-In2O3 catalyst was tested for 200 h time-on-stream experiment (Fig. 9 ). Overall, the 2.5K5Co-In2O3 catalyst exhibited a slight decrease in CO2 conversion and space time yield of C2+OH after the 200-h time-on-stream experiment indicating the excellent stability of the 2.5K5Co-In2O3 catalyst at 380 °C. The spent 2.5K5Co-In2O3 was further analyzed with the XRD technique; the result is displayed in Fig. 2. The diffraction lines of spent 2.5K5Co-In2O3 catalyst appeared at the identical 2θ values of the reduced 2.5K5Co-In2O3 catalyst, suggesting that the In species was still present as In2O3 and Co was not incorporated into the In2O3 lattice. The In2O3 crystallite size of reduced and spent 2.5K5Co-In2O3 calculated with the Scherrer’s Equation [43] using the diffraction line at 2θ of 30.6° was found to be 18.6 and 19.5 nm, suggesting the high thermal stability of In2O3 in the 2.5K5Co-In2O3 catalyst."
7,Conclusions,"K-Co supported on In2O3 catalysts were prepared and examined for CO2 hydrogenation to higher alcohols. Pure In2O3 acted as the active site for the transformation of CO2 to CO without the CO dissociation. Either K or Co decorated In2O3 did not show the significant advance on the formation of higher alcohols. However, combining K and Co with In2O3 exhibited a superior performance for higher alcohols production. The optimized K-Co-In2O3 catalyst achieved a high space time yield of higher alcohols (169.6 g kgcat -1h−1) and higher alcohols distribution (87.4%) with the excellent stability up to 200 h. The improved catalytic performance was attributed to the formation of K-O-Co sites which significantly reduced the weak H2 adsorption and strengthened the interaction of H2 with the catalyst surface, strongly suppressing the hydrogenation of adsorbed alkyl species to saturated hydrocarbon products, while allowing the CO insertion into adsorbed alkyl species to form higher alcohols product. Our finding provides essential information for the rational design of efficient catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to higher alcohols."
