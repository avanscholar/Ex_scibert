0,Introduction,"Visible-light-driven photocatalysis is a promising alternative for sustainable H2 fuel production as well as environmental detoxification [1]. As a renewable, pollution-free, and high-yield-upon-combustion (122 kJ/mol) energy source, H2 is anticipated to solve the global energy crisis in the future [1,2]. In addition, the photocatalytic degradation of persistent water pollutants is expected to resolve a likely potable water crisis through water purification for reuse [3–6]. Hence, intensive research is in-full-swing to develop a highly efficient photocatalyst for H2 fuel production and wastewater decontamination. Accordingly, semiconductors are among the most explored materials for photocatalytic applications [1,7]. Semiconductor photocatalysis is a preferred approach because semiconductors possess desirable chemical, physical, and catalytic characteristics and the potential to exploit UV and visible light (VL) [8]. Additional qualities associated with most semiconductors include complete purification or catalytic action, a long lifespan, and an environmentally benign nature [9]. Among the multitude of semiconductors, copper(II) oxide (CuO) and zinc oxide (ZnO) have attracted intensive interest because of their advantages of nontoxicity, low cost, rapid adsorption ability, high stability, high catalytic performance, and multifunctionality [3]. ZnO is a versatile n-type semiconductor comprising a wide bandgap (3.37 eV), substantial exciton binding energy (~60 meV), excellent thermal stability, and the ability to form heterojunction composites with other semiconductors. ZnO nanomaterials have been employed in a wide-ranging applications and devices, including photocatalysis, photochemical water-splitting catalysis, photodetectors, photonic crystals, supercapacitors, biosensors, transparent conducting oxides, and solar cells [10]. As a photocatalyst, ZnO outperforms TiO2 because it absorbs a comparatively greater portion of the solar spectrum [11]. The preparation method, which influences structural, morphological, and optical properties of the synthesized product, can also improve the photocatalytic and other capabilities of ZnO [12]. Nevertheless, the practical utility of ZnO alone as a photocatalyst is limited. The most pressing problems are the obstruction of catalytically active sites because of a low specific surface area, poor VL harvesting, serious agglomeration, poor carrier separation, instant recombination of photon-induced electron–hole pairs, and photo-corrosion of the ZnO catalyst itself [3,8,13]. CuO is a p-type semiconductor encompassed with a low bandgap energy (1.2–2.6 eV, depending on synthesis variables), remarkable electrical and thermal conductivity, and high stability [14]. It is nontoxic and naturally abundant and is appropriate for use in numerous applications and devices such as photocatalysis, lithium-ion batteries, solar energy devices, optoelectronic devices, and gas sensors [7,11]. Moreover, particularly prepared CuO micro/nanostructures have revealed notable performance in photocatalytic dye degradation [15]. Although CuO promotes the absorption of VL, it suffers from comparatively low photocatalytic efficiency owing to the instant recombination of emanated charge carriers [16]. However, it is an excellent supporting photocatalyst to enhance the photocatalytic performance of heterojunction systems [8]. Liu et al., for instance, fabricated CuO–ZnO with a corn-like architecture and reported remarkable photocatalytic H2 generation, where the catalytic performance was enhanced by the formation of a heterojunction and by the special morphology of the product [13]. Taraka et al. synthesized hierarchical CuO–ZnO (p–n) heterojunctions and achieved high photo-induced reduction of CO2 into methanol [17]. Saravanan et al. constructed a CuO–ZnO heterojunction nanocomposite and achieved enhanced photodegradation of a textile dye under VL illumination [18]. Similar enhancements in the photocatalytic performance of various photocatalysts in consequence of the generation of a heterojunction between CuO and ZnO have been reported in numerous accounts [19–23]. We here substantiate a versatile approach to transform a wide-bandgap semiconductor into a VL-active photocatalyst via straightforward co-crystallization followed by high pressure annealing. The coupling of two semiconductors with different bandgap energies generated a permanent CuO–ZnO heterojunction and substantially upgraded the photocatalytic efficiency of both constituents. Our approach resolves shortcoming associated with the use of both ZnO and CuO individually, i.e., poor VL harvesting, agglomeration of particles, inadequate separation between photoinduced charge carriers and their instant recombination in ZnO, and the low photocatalytic efficiency of CuO (when used alone) because of immediate recombination of light-induced electrons and holes. As-constructed hybrid p–n-type heterojunction between ZnO and CuO shifts the optical absorption toward the VL region, dramatically promotes the separation between photon-induced charge carriers, and inhibits their recombination. The charge carriers are consequently available to accelerate photocatalytic reactions. Moreover, our approach is effective to inhibit the photo-corrosion of ZnO due to chemical bonding with CuO, which is critical for ensuring the recycling performance of a profitable photocatalyst. The novelty of the present work is to address the difficulties prevailing in the CuO-ZnO nanocomposites. Previous catalyst synthesis involved the use of multiple steps or capping reagents. In addition, the optical absorbance range and bandgap energy were unsatisfactory, limiting to the single application of the photocatalyst. We achieved a unique structure with a significant redshift of the optical absorbance, a significant decrease in the bandgap energy, a maximum contraction of the PL intensity, and the formation of permanent heterojunctions in nano-sized composite particles. All improvements were critical for the remarkable catalytic performance of the products, which successfully constructed a photocatalyst to address the limitations of previous works. Also, our product is multi-functional; it is highly efficient for H2 fuel production as well as water pollutant degradation."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Zinc acetate dihydrate (99% purity, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), copper(II) acetate hydrate (98% purity, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), ethanol (99.5% purity, Sigma-Aldrich), methylene blue (MB) (Alfa Aesar, high purity, Lancashire, UK), sodium sulfite (98% purity, Sigma-Aldrich), and sodium sulfide nonahydrate (98% purity, Sigma-Aldrich) were used with no further purification. Distilled water was used in all solution preparations."
3,Synthesis of CuO–ZnO nanobullets,"2.2 Synthesis of CuO–ZnO nanobullets A series of CuO–ZnO nanobullet photocatalysts were prepared via an efficient co-crystallization process, followed by high pressure annealing. Initially, zinc acetate dihydrate (3.0 g) and copper(II) acetate monohydrate (3.0 g) were transferred into a container containing ethanol as a solvent (50 mL) and the resultant mixture was homogenized using a magnetic stirrer (15 min) followed by bath sonication for 1 h at ambient temperature (25 °C). The container containing the mixture was carefully removed from the sonicator and was left untouched for 8 h for co-crystallization. The aggregated crystals of zinc acetate dihydrate and copper(II) acetate hydrate were then vacuum filtrated to wipe out the ethanol (solvent). The solid residue was dried in a furnace at 70 °C for 3 h to completely drive off the remaining solvent molecules. The desiccated and brittle mass of the copper(II) acetate–zinc acetate mingled crystals was retained in a quartz crucible. That crucible was then loaded into a vacuum chamber with a sealable lid. The lid of the vacuum chamber was vacuum-packed with a well-fitted copper gasket (SUS 314) to maintain a high pressure (2–3 atm) inside the chamber and avoid the intrusion of atmospheric oxygen into the reaction chamber. The vacuum chamber was erected inside a muffle-type furnace at 500 °C to fabricate CuO–ZnO nanobullets. The thus-obtained grayish-black product was collected, rinsed repeatedly with distilled water followed by ethanol, and finally dried in a preheated furnace at 70 °C for 10 h. Different samples were constructed by maintaining a fixed temperature of 500 °C and changing only the calcination time. The samples calcined for 15, 30, and 60 min were named as CZ-15, CZ-30, and CZ-60, respectively."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi SU-8230) and field-emission energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (FE-EF-TEM, Jeol JEM-2200FS) were used to characterize the morphology of the fabricated nanostructures. FE SEM was also accompanied by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to probe the elemental composition and purity of the composites. High-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Smart Lab) was used to probe the structural characteristics, whereas the spectroscopic aspects of the nanocomposites were elucidated through high-performance X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HP-XPS, ThermoFisher K-ALPHA+, NEXSA) and UV–vis spectrophotometry (PerkinElmer Lambda 25). A luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer LS 55) was used to record photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the products; the spectra were collected over the 200–900 nm wavelength range at room temperature employing an excitation wavelength of 275 nm and a 350 nm cutoff filter. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was utilized to explore the chemical bonds and functional groups in the nanocomposites and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller/Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BET/BJH) probes were adopted to study the specific surface area and volume of the as-synthesized samples using ASAP 2420 (V2.09, Micromeritics)."
5,Synthesis of pristine ZnO nanobullets and CuO nanocrystals,"2.4 Synthesis of pristine ZnO nanobullets and CuO nanocrystals Pristine ZnO nanobullets and CuO nanostructures were synthesized via recrystallization of zinc acetate dihydrate and copper(II) acetate hydrate from ethanol, respectively, following the procedure described in Section 2.2. Both the pristine ZnO and CuO nanostructures were used as controls when evaluating the photocatalytic performance of the CuO–ZnO composite samples."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen generation,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen generation Hydrogen gas was generated via water splitting using a reaction flask containing 50 mL each of aqueous Na2SO3 (0.5 M) and Na2S (0.5 M) as electron donors. An accurately weighed amount (50.0 mg) of CuO–ZnO photocatalyst was released into the reaction flask, and the mixture was bath sonicated under dark conditions for 30 min. The sonicated mixture was left in a dark chamber for 1 h to lead to adsorption–desorption equilibrium among the photocatalyst surfaces and the electron-donor molecules. N2 gas was blown into the reaction mixture for 20 min to thoroughly eliminate dissolved O2 before the mixture was subjected to photocatalytic treatment. The photocatalytic experiments were conducted under sunlight simulated using Xe short-arc lamp (OSRAM XBO R 300W/60C). A water-filled gas burette system was used to collect and measure the volume of H2 generated in the photocatalytic reaction. A burette, completely filled with water, was connected to the reaction flask via a thin extensible pipe to measure the volume of H2 evolved from the reaction. The volume of H2 was determined by evaluating the displacement of the water in the burette every 30 min, and the reaction was continued for 180 min. The exact volume of dry H2 at normal temperature and pressure (NTP) was calculated on the basis of the partial pressure and combined gas equations. The ambient temperature and pressure were also considered in the calculations."
7,Photocatalytic dye degradation,"2.6 Photocatalytic dye degradation MB dye degradation reactions were carried out using the same light source detailed in Section 2.5. In each test set, a CuO–ZnO photocatalyst (20.0 mg) was added to the photochemical reactor containing an MB solution prepared using distilled water (100 mL, 0.025 g/L). Homogeneous mixing of the components was achieved via magnetic stirring (1 h), and the whole reaction system was positioned in a dark cavity (1 h) to ensure that adsorption–desorption equilibrium was achieved among the photo-catalytically active sites and MB molecules. The reaction mixture was subsequently subjected to simulated sunlight. The photodegradation of MB solution with respect to time was examined through the UV–vis absorbance measurements of the sample solution at a regular time interval."
8,Reusability assessment,2.7 Reusability assessment Each dose of CuO–ZnO photocatalyst was collected and washed numerous times with distilled water before being desiccated at 70 °C for 6 h in a preheated furnace for subsequent investigation of its recyclability. The photocatalysts were recycled five times in MB photodegradation experiments.
9,Deduction of the point of zero charge and pH effects,"2.8 Deduction of the point of zero charge and pH effects The pH value for the point of zero charge (pHPZC) of the CZ nanocomposites was figured out using the pH drift technique. In each experiment, a volume of 0.01 M NaCl solution was released into a 100 mL beaker and its initial pH value was adjusted to the desired value by dropwise adding of 0.01 M NaOH or 0.01 M HCl solution. Twenty milliliters of the pH-adjusted NaCl solution were poured into a vial, and 0.004 g of the CZ-30 photocatalyst was released into it. The mixture was subjected to magnetic stirring system for 24 h to disperse the photocatalyst uniformly in the pH-adjusted NaCl solution. Initial pH values of 2.00, 4.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00, and 12.00 were maintained, and the corresponding final pH values were recorded after 24 h. The pHPZC value of the CZ photocatalyst was then quantified by plotting the change in pH (ΔpH) versus the initial pH (pHi). The influence of pH on the photocatalytic degradation of MB was examined by adjusting the initial pH of MB solutions with the same concentrations used in the photocatalytic experiments (Section 2.6) by addition of 0.01 N NaOH or 0.01 N HCl solution. A separate set of photocatalytic experiments was performed (as described in Section 2.6) for initial pH values of 2.00, 9.00, and 12.00 of the MB solution. The results were compared with corresponding to the ambient pH (6.54) of the MB solution."
10,Charge-carrier trapping experiments,"2.9 Charge-carrier trapping experiments We conducted charge-carrier trapping experiments to detect the presence of charge carriers and elucidate their likely photocatalytic role in MB degradation. Isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 3 mL), 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ, 5 mg), and potassium iodide (KI, 5 mg) were availed to scavenge photogenerated hydroxyl (˙OH) radicals, superoxide (˙O2 −) radicals, and holes (h +), respectively. Each of these scavengers was used in a separate set of experiments. All of the experiments were performed as explained in Section 2.6; the only difference was that a scavenging agent was added to the solution along with the photocatalyst."
11,Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis,2.10 Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis The substrate MB solution before and after subjecting to the photocatalytic action of the nanocomposite photocatalysts was explored via LC-MS technique to identify and confirm the fragments originated after degradation. Aliquot of 5 μL having refined sample was injected into the LC system (LC 1200 Series) in each of the inputs. Electrospray ionization (ESI) interface was deployed to produce the ions in positive-ionization mode (+ESI). The analysis parameters were set at the standard operating conditions.
12,Results and discussion,
13,Morphological characterizations,"3.1 Morphological characterizations The morphological features of the as-fabricated CuO–ZnO nanobullets were scrutinized by FE-SEM; the corresponding micrographs are presented in Fig. 1. The CuO–ZnO composite particles (Fig. 1(b–d)) exhibit a peculiar small-bullet-like appearance and are therefore referred to as “nanobullets.” The pristine ZnO nanoparticles (Fig. 1(a)) are more agglomerated and exhibit a less distinct shape than the pristine CuO nanoparticles (inset of Fig. 1(a)), which exhibit discrete monoclinic crystalline shapes with almost no agglomeration. In general, calcination at higher temperatures favors the growth of agglomerated florets because of the adhesion of particles through weak bonds [11]. However, the CuO–ZnO composite nanoparticles grew into interesting shapes with less aggregation. This behavior is attributed to the role of CuO, which can regulate the size and patterning of ZnO particles by controlling their nucleation and growth [18]. The final morphology might have been achieved via the fusion of CuO planes with those of ZnO during the crystal growth process. The CuO–ZnO nanobullets obtained after different calcination times exhibit similar shapes but different sizes. Their length ranges between 1 and 3 µm, and their diameter between 20 and 200 nm. Each composite nanostructure exhibits smooth surfaces with a plain end at the bottom and a hexagonal tapered tip. The nanobullets are densely arranged and quasi-aligned vertically, although the alignment does not appear to be consistent for CZ-30. The micrographs show that, with increasing calcination time, the length of the composite nanobullets decreased and their thickness gradually increased. The elemental composition and purity of the as-synthesized composite materials were substantiated via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS); the corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 2. The EDS micrographs captured during HR-TEM analysis are presented in Supplementary Information, Fig. S1. The images demonstrate a higher surface occupancy of Zn in comparison with Cu and O. Such an observation is attributable to differential retaining of zinc and copper acetates during recrystallization step and the presence of high oxygen vacancy (discussed in detail later in XPS analysis) in the obtained product. The images of CZ-30 presented in Figs. 1 and 2 seem to be of different sizes apparently as the images were captured at different areas and magnifications. Elemental mapping analysis reveals the distribution of atoms in the CuO–ZnO heterostructures and enables us to identify the regions of interfacial junction between these two oxides. Such an interface can be formed by contact of the (111) facet of CuO grown along the corresponding (101) plane of ZnO [23]. These results confirm a fused geometry of the CuO–ZnO heterojunction nanobullets. The microstructure of the CuO–ZnO nanobullets was further characterized by FE-EF-TEM; paradigmatic tomograms are presented in Fig. 3. Because the TEM images of the composite samples differed only slightly, only the micrographs of the CZ-30 specimen are. presented here. The irregularly shaped heterostructures formed an interconnected film of thin layers, which we attributed to the influence of ultrasonication during the preparation of the TEM analyte. The images at successively higher magnification reveal that the individual heterostructures (20–200 nm) are composed of numerous smaller nanoparticles (5–10 nm); each such nanoparticle is recognized as a ZnO or CuO nanoparticle. The high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3(c)) shows discontinuous lattice stripes. Between the adjacent fringes, the interplanar d-spacing was 0.1986 nm, 0.2473 nm, and 0.2584 nm, which are ascribed to the (−202) and (101), (002) lattice planes of monoclinic CuO and hexagonal wurtzite ZnO, correspondingly [3,17,24,25]. The FE-EF-TEM tomograms show that the fabricated CZ materials are heterojunction nanocomposites with a combined geometry. Notably, heterojunctions amplify the active sites and strongly enhance the dynamic sites for the adsorption of reactant molecules, which favors the segregation of electron–hole pairs leading to remarkable photocatalytic activity. Fig. 3(d) discloses the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of a p–n CuO–ZnO heterojunctions, indicating the generation of polycrystalline heterojunction composites [17,24]."
14,Structural characterization,"3.2 Structural characterization The XRD patterns of pristine CuO, pristine ZnO, and CuO–ZnO composite specimens were collected to characterize their crystallinity; the corresponding details are presented in Fig. 4. The diffraction peaks generated by pristine CuO (Fig. 4(a)) at 2θ values of 43.41°, 50.53°, and 74.22° are ascribed to the (111), (−202), and (222) facets of crystalline monoclinic CuO, correspondingly [3]. The characteristic diffraction peaks (Fig. 4b) at 31.42°, 34.56°, 36.30°, 47.55°, 56.64°, 62.95°, 66.53°, 67.98°, 69.28°, 72.78°, and 77.10° are associated with the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112), (201), (004), and (202) planes of crystalline hexagonal wurtzite ZnO, respectively [10]. As evident from Fig. 4(c–e), all of the diffraction peaks associated with CuO and ZnO remained at the same 2θ values in the diffraction patterns of the CuO–ZnO nanocomposite samples. This observation implies that the crystalline nature of both oxides remained unaltered in the CZ heterojunction nanocomposites. No characteristic peaks due to other compounds were observed, confirming the purity of the as-synthesized heterojunction composites. An XRD peak associated with ZnO in the pattern of the CZ-30 sample was used in conjunction with Scherrer’s equation [10] to determine the average crystallite size. The peak at 36.30° (2θ), which was assigned as a reflection of the (101) plane (the most intense peak in the pattern), was selected to calculate the crystallite size, which was found to be 25.42 nm. FTIR spectroscopy was used to screen and scan the as-synthesized samples to pinpoint the chemical bonding and functional groups present in the molecules. Fig. 5 expresses the FTIR spectra of the pristine CuO, pristine ZnO, and the CuO–ZnO nanocomposites, as recorded capturing the wavelength range 500–4000 cm−1. The spectra demonstrate two kinds of curves: one curve type for CZ-60, with broader stretching band, and one type for CZ-30 and CZ-15, resembling those of pristine CuO and ZnO. In the spectrum of CZ-60 (Fig. 5(a)), the widest peak (3477 cm−1) corresponds to the stretching modes of O–H and N–H groups [3]. The other broad peak at 3161 cm−1 is assigned to C–H stretching, whereas the peaks at 1634 and 1400 cm−1 are attributable to the stretching action of CO groups and bending of the C–H bonds of methyl groups, respectively. Moreover, the peak at 474 cm−1 is accredited to the arrangement of metal–oxygen (M–O) stretching modes (νCu–O or νZn–O) [3]. By contrast, the O–H and C–H stretches were split into four narrower peaks in the spectra of CZ-30, CZ-15, pristine CuO, and pristine ZnO (Fig. 5(b)–(e)), with the peaks at approximately the same position in the spectra of all three samples. The stretching signals due to O–H and C–H vibrations appear at 3570, 3523, 3446, and 3361 cm−1. The CO peak appears at 1650 cm−1, whereas that of the COOH group appears at 1618 cm−1. The peak at 684 cm−1 is attributable to the distortion of the M–O–C bond. The peak at 537 cm−1 is assigned to Cu–O groups, whereas that at 450 cm−1 depicts Zn–O stretching. The synthesized nanocomposites were further analyzed for elemental composition and oxidation states of the integrant elements via HP-XPS; the corresponding profiles are presented in Fig. 6. The higher-resolution survey profiles of pristine and composite samples are presented in Fig. 6(a), which confirms the chemically combined states of Cu, O, and Zn in all of the nanocomposites. Fig. 6(b) compares the XPS profiles of pristine ZnO and nanocomposite samples, confirming the occupancy of the Zn2+ ions in all the samples. The 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 maxima at 1021.47 and 1044.51 eV, respectively, are attributed to the Zn2+ form of Zn in the pristine sample; the same peaks are observed in the plots of the composite samples. The spin–orbit splitting value of 23.04 eV, as obtained from a straightforward calculation from the spectra, further confirms Zn2+ states; this spin–orbit splitting value matches that reported in the literature [7,8]. The lack of shoulder peaks allied to the prominent Zn2+ peaks implies that the Zn2+ ions retain their divalent frame in all of the samples [10]. The Zn2+ peaks in the spectra of the nanocomposite samples are slightly shifted toward higher binding energies in consequence of the chemical combination of ZnO with CuO [8]. Fig. 6(c) shows the XPS features for the Cu-2p scan of pristine as well as CuO–ZnO nanocomposites; the prevalence of Cu2+ in two nonequivalent chemical environments is evident in the spectra of the composites. In the spectrum of pristine CuO, the maxima at 932.0 and 951.84 eV are binding energies designating the 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 Cu states [26]. The spin–orbit separation of 19.84 eV confirms a + 2 oxidation state of the Cu [8,27]; this separation is observed in the spectra of both the pure and composite samples. These results are further reinforced by the emergence of a distinctive shake-up peak in the region 940–945 eV, which is typical for the CuO state (i.e., no shake-up peak is observed in the absence of CuO species [3]). A shift in the binding energies of the composite samples toward higher values is attributed to the difference in electronegativity between Zn (1.6) and Cu (1.9), which promotes electronic exchange at their interfaces [8]. The O-1s core-level plots of the CZ-composite samples displaying the prevalence of three different forms of O-species are presented in Fig. 6(d–f), where the peaks attributable to each O-containing species in all three samples appears at approximately the same binding energy value, with minor differences. The peak that emerged at 530 eV in the spectra of all three composite samples is assigned to O2− in the CuO and ZnO [13]. The middle component at 531 eV is attributed to vacant O sites, while the third component at 532 eV corresponds to surface-chemisorbed O-containing species such as OH, O2, or H2O [28]. The O-1s spectra clarify that the abundance of O vacancies and surface-chemisorbed O species is diminished with increasing calcination time of the samples (i.e., from CZ-15 to CZ-60). The presence of oxygen vacancy defects in both the constituent metal oxides has resulted in the lower proportion of oxygen in the heterojunction nanocomposite."
15,Photoluminescence and optical characterization,"3.3 Photoluminescence and optical characterization The enhanced separation and transfer or the stunted recombination tendencies of photon-generated e −/h + pairs were analyzed via PL spectroscopy; the corresponding details are illustrated in Fig. 7(a). A higher PL intensity indicates a faster recombination of charge carriers, whereas a lower intensity indicates their retarded or restricted recombination [27,29]. The restricted recombination of e −/h + pairs prolongs their lifetime and supplies excess charge carriers to participate in redox reactions under light exposure [27]. The figure shows a remarkable decrease in the PL intensity of the CZ-composite samples compared with the uncombined form of both ZnO and CuO, confirming that the generation of p–n heterojunctions at the interfaces of ZnO and CuO substantially inhibits the e −/h + pair recombination and enhances the photocatalytic action. Moreover, the PL spectra reveal that the ZnO more strongly influences the separation and transfer of photogenerated e −/h + pairs than does the CuO. The PL spectrum of uncombined ZnO shows a broad crest at 383–413 nm, which is ascribed to the band-edge emission because of the recombination of unbound excitons; the other emission bands in the visible region (at 482 and 526 nm) suggest the presence of O-vacancy defects and deep traps created by interstitial defects in ZnO/CuO [14,17]. The PL spectra of pristine CuO and the composite samples show a broad peak at 398–416 nm; the other peaks appeared at the same wavelengths as in the spectrum of pristine ZnO. Among the composite samples, CZ-30 exhibited the maximum contraction in PL intensity. The UV–vis absorption arrays of the pristine and composite samples are displayed in Fig. 7(b) and the corresponding Tauc Plots with additional information are disclosed in Figs. S2 and S3. The spectra of the pristine ZnO, CuO and the composite samples show robust absorption within the investigated wavelength range. All of the peaks in the spectra of the composite samples are remarkably red-shifted contrasted with the tip in the spectrum of pure ZnO (372 nm); in addition, the CZ-30 specimen, whose spectrum shows a peak at 382 nm, exhibits the largest red shift among the composite samples. Such a red-shift is attributable to enhanced light harvesting due to the formation of chemical bonds between the ZnO and CuO. Consequently, the augmented visible-light absorption contributes to produce sufficiently large numbers of e −/h + pairs for redox reactions; thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performance of the products."
16,Specific surface area and pore-volume studies,"3.4 Specific surface area and pore-volume studies Specific surface area (SSA), pore volume, and pore size of the as-constructed nanocomposites were examined via BET/BJH measurements; the prominent findings are summarized in Table S1. The results reveal that the SSA of the nanocomposite samples is remarkably augmented compared to that of the pristine samples, and the CZ-30 has highest SSA. It implies that the chemical bonding between ZnO and CuO elevated the SSA of the as-synthesized materials. The higher SSA of the photocatalysts enhances the adsorption of substrate molecules onto it and improves the rate of photocatalytic dye degradation."
17,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The photocatalytic H2 generation ability of our samples is demonstrated in Fig. 8, where the catalytic actions of the CZ composite samples are shown to be substantially superior to that of the pristine ZnO. The amount of H2 evolved by CZ-30, CZ-60, CZ-15, and bare ZnO in 3 h was 4.094, 3.916, 3.471, and 1.958 mmol, respectively. Bare CuO could not produce a detectable quantity of H2 within the observed time. The optimum quantity of each sample (i.e., 50 mg) was used for the photocatalytic production of H2. Among the CZ composites, CZ-30 demonstrated the highest activity for the production of H2 via water decomposition. Because CZ-30 demonstrated the best photocatalytic action, its dose was optimized under same experimental conditions. Fig. 8(b) shows the actions of different doses of CZ-30, where a 50 mg dose of the photocatalyst is clearly the optimum dose. Because the number of active spots on the photocatalyst surface or its surface area enlarges with augmenting photocatalyst dose, determining its optimum quantity is critical for efficient photocatalytic performance. A greater number of photocatalytically active sites will produce greater proportions of ˙OH and ˙O2 − radicals, which are critical for photodegradation reactions. Nevertheless, because of growing opacity of the reaction mixture (suspension), the photodegradation efficiency is diminished when the catalyst dose exceeds the optimum dose. An increase in opacity reduces the transmission of light, whereby the photocatalyst facet becomes unavailable for proper light harvesting and the production of charge carriers. The photocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized catalysts was enhanced by sacrificial inorganic reagents sulfite ( SO 3 2 − ) and sulfide (S2−); these agents function as effective hole accepters, resulting in the preferred separation of e −/h + pairs. The use of S2− and/or SO 3 2 − as sacrificial agents has been suggested to be advantageous over the use of alcohols because they exhibit more facile oxidizability than alcohols. In addition, the mixing of the reducing agent, SO 3 2 − , with a S2− solution inhibits the formation of disulfide ions and enhances the yield of H2 produced from water [30]. The mechanism of water splitting for the photocatalytic H2 preparation in a S2−/ SO 3 2 − system is suggested in Eqs. (1)–(6): (1) 2 H2O + 2e- →H2 + 2 OH− (2) SO 3 2 − + 2 OH − + 2 h + → SO 4 2 − + H 2 O (3) 2 SO 3 2 − + 2 h + → S 2 O 6 2 − (4) 2 S 2 − + 2 h + → S 2 2 − (5) SO 3 2 − + S 2 − + 2 h + → S 2 O 3 2 − (6) S 2 2 − + SO 3 2 − → S 2 O 3 2 − + S 2 − The photogenerated holes (h +) are captured by a number of reactions, as depicted in Eqs. (2)–(5), whereby excess electrons are available to split water to generate H2 gas. Though CuO has a smaller bandgap and can absorb a much greater amount of solar radiation than ZnO, it alone cannot provide the excess of electrons needed for redox reactions owing to the instant recombination of charge carriers. However, it plays a pivotal photocatalytic role when chemically combined with ZnO nanostructures. When a CuO–ZnO heterojunction is illuminated, the enriched electrons in the CuO conduction band (CB) get further excited, triggering their migration to the ZnO CB [31]. The holes generated in the ZnO valence band (VB) as a result of the same irradiation are immediately consumed by the sacrificial agents [30]. Thus, sustained free electrons in the ZnO CB are sufficiently energetic to attack water molecules and release H2 gas. This mechanism explains why the photocatalytic activities of CuO–ZnO heterostructures are remarkably better than that of bare ZnO or uncombined CuO. In the composite, H2 generation occurs in the CB of the ZnO section. In the CuO VB, the holes are mostly consumed by SO 3 2 − or S2−. The schematic in Fig. 9 displays the efficient charge separation as a result of heterojunction formation and the subsequent catalytic splitting of water."
18,Photocatalytic dye degradation,"3.6 Photocatalytic dye degradation We examined the photocatalytic performance of the as-constructed CZ composites by using them in the visible-light-driven decomposition of the organic dye MB for an irradiation time of 80 min. Reactions in the presence of bare ZnO nanobullets and uncombined CuO nanocrystals were used as control experiments. Fig. 10 and Fig. S4 disclose the time-dependent UV–vis absorption spectra of CZ-60, CZ-30, CZ-15, uncombined ZnO, and bare CuO after catalytic treatment under identical ambient conditions. While exploring photocatalytic decomposition, the adsorption of MB molecules on the surface of the photocatalyst was also surveilled by magnetically stirring the photocatalysts with the dye solution (1 h) followed by leaving the reaction mixture undisturbed in a lightless chamber (additional 1 h) to achieve adsorption-desorption equilibrium. It is discernible from Fig. 10 (d) that each of the photocatalysts has adsorbed the dye molecules noticeably. The higher the adsorption of dye molecules on the surface of the photocatalyst, the greater is the probability of its photodecomposition. The gradual downfall in intensity of the distinguishing absorption peak of MB at 664 nm with elapsed exposure time was monitored to determine the extent of MB decomposition. The chemically combined CuO–ZnO heterostructures revealed enhanced photocatalytic activity compared with the uncombined constituent oxides. The maximum degradation of MB via the catalytic action of CZ-30, CZ-60, CZ-15, uncombined ZnO, and bare CuO was 98.6%, 94.33%, 88.24%, 66.58%, and 47.37%, respectively, within 80 min under exposure to visible light. The photodecomposition percentage of MB was computed from Eq. (7) [7]: (7) Decomposition ( % ) = C 0 − C t C 0 × 100 where C 0 and C t represent the concentrations of MB solution at the initial time (t = 0) and at time t, correspondingly. The likely self-degradation of MB under exposure to visible light was tested via a blank test, where an MB solution with no catalyst was exposed to visible light for the same duration under identical conditions. The results are depicted in Fig. S5. Comparatively insignificant self-decomposition (11.48%) of MB was observed in the blank test. Kinetic plots of ln(C 0/C t ) in response to irradiation time reveal that the photodegradation of MB followed pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics; the corresponding plots are displayed in Fig. 10(e). The reaction rate constant (k) values, as determined from the kinetic plots, were 0.0529, 0.0348, 0.0265, 0.0137, 0.0073, and 0.0015 min−1 for CZ-30, CZ-60, CZ-15, pristine ZnO, pristine CuO, and the blank test, respectively. The reaction rates of the CZ-composite samples are conspicuously higher than those of uncombined ZnO or CuO. Among the as-synthesized photocatalysts, CZ-30 demonstrated the best performance. Hence, we evaluated the recycling performance of CZ-30 under similar reaction conditions; the corresponding results are presented in Fig. S6. The initial activity of the photocatalyst accounted for MB degradation decreased by 9.48% at the fifth recycle. Such a decrease in photocatalytic activity is attributable to the loss of photocatalyst during recycling. Because the optimum amount of the photocatalyst was small (20 mg), the loss of trace quantities of it on filter paper during the collection and washing steps resulted in a progressively smaller amount of active catalyst in subsequent recycling experiments. Furthermore, the superior photocatalytic competency of our products was asserted via their comparison with the results of previously reported systems and the information is presented in Supplementary Information (Table S2 and S3). It is evident that our CZ-composite is better photocatalyst vis-a-vis MB degradation and photocatalytic hydrogen generation."
19,Effect of pHPZC and pH on photocatalytic decomposition,"3.7 Effect of pHPZC and pH on photocatalytic decomposition The photocatalyst with the best performance (i.e., CZ-30) was selected for the determination of pHPZC via the pH shift method; the results are presented in Fig. S7(a). The pHPZC value of CZ-30 was 8.40. This value is very similar to that reported elsewhere [32] and indicates that the surface of our as-designed nanocomposite was positively charged at pH levels less than 8.40 and negatively electrified at pH levels greater than 8.40. Because MB exists as a cation in aqueous solution, the adsorption of MB onto the surface of a photocatalyst increases when the pH is greater than the pHPZC and decreases when the pH is lesser than the pHPZC. The influence of pH on the photodeterioration of MB is demonstrated in Fig. S7(b). The weakest degradation of MB was encountered at pH 2, which is attributed to low adsorption of cationic MB molecules onto the CZ-composite surface because of strong repulsion. By contrast, the fastest photodegradation of MB was achieved at pH 12, which is attributed to the high adsorption of positively charged dye molecules onto the photocatalyst surfaces. In addition, the availability of excess OH− ions at higher pH (alkaline solution) promotes the genesis of ˙OH radicals and promotes the photocatalytic reaction."
20,Mechanism of photocatalytic action,"3.8 Mechanism of photocatalytic action The mechanism of the catalytic action of the CuO–ZnO composites can be understood in terms of greater visible-light absorption capability, greater separation of the photon-induced charge carriers via the p–n heterojunction formation between CuO and ZnO, and the synergistic effects of these components. The conduction of energetic electrons from CuO to ZnO occurs through the heterojunction via the route discussed in Section 3.5. The calculation of CB and VB edge potentials is elaborated in Supplementary Information. The excess of free electrons in the ZnO CB reacts with dissolved O2 molecules and produces ˙O2 − radical anions, which react further to generate highly reactive •OH radicals. Moreover, the separated holes react with the surrounding OH− anions and create additional hydroxyl radicals [7]. The thus-generated •OH radicals attack the MB molecules adsorbed onto the active surface of the photocatalyst to decompose them. The decomposition of MB first generates some intermediates, which are attacked repeatedly by •OH radicals until they are converted into innocuous or less-harmful inorganic molecules such as CO2, H2O, sulfate ions, or nitrate ions [32]."
21,Charge-carrier trapping experiments,"3.9 Charge-carrier trapping experiments Photocatalytic charge-carrier scavengers—specifically, IPA to scavenge ˙OH, BQ to scavenge ˙O2 −, and KI to trap h +—were used to pinpoint the prominent reactive species executing the photodecomposition reaction and to confirm the mechanism of catalytic action. The results are presented in Fig. S8. With the use of CZ-30 photocatalyst and in the observed time of 80 min, 56.33% of the MB dye remained unaffected in the presence of IPA, 33.05% remained in the presence of KI, and 19.83% remained unaffected in the presence of BQ. By contrast, as elaborated in Section 3.6, only 1.4% of MB remained undecomposed because of the action of CZ-30 in the absence of any scavenger during 80 min of visible-light exposure. These results imply that the principal reactive oxygen species responsible for the photodecomposition of MB are ˙OH radicals, followed by h + and ˙O2 −. Fig. S8 shows that the ˙O2 − radicals play less prominent roles than ˙OH radicals and h + in the photodegradation of MB. When the suspension (of photocatalyst and dye solution) containing IPA is irradiated with visible light, powerful oxidants (˙OH radicals) are generated in the solution. These ˙OH radicals are instantly trapped by IPA molecules and therefore cannot attack MB molecules; hence, the rate of photocatalytic decomposition of MB decreases. Similarly, KI scavenged h + and BQ trapped ˙O2 −, also resulting in slower dye decomposition."
22,Detection of the degraded fragments via LC-MS,"3.10 Detection of the degraded fragments via LC-MS The LC-MS spectra of MB before and after photocatalytic deterioration were analyzed to recognize the substrate and decomposition product-molecules; the corresponding information is presented in Fig. S9. The LC-MS spectrum of untreated MB reveals a robust peak at m/z 284.10 (Fig. S9(a)). However, the intermediates or byproducts of its decomposition were observed at m/z values of 111, 126, 135, 148, 158, 169, 184, 189, 217 and 242 (Fig. S9(b)) indicating that MB has been degraded into smaller fragments leading to mineralization. All of the observed species were indexed based on the information reported in the literature [33–37]. It is explicit from the figures that the eminent peak in the LC-MS spectrum of untreated MB is significantly plummeted compared to that of photodegraded sample. The structural formulae of the degraded fragments have been deduced based on their reported m/z values (Fig. S10). During the photocatalytic action, robustly oxidizing ˙OH radicals induce demethylation or hydroxylation amidst oxidation to exfoliate the benzene rings of MB. The degradation reactions continue until the inoffensive inorganic end products, viz., H2O, CO2, sulfates and nitrates get formed [33]. Furthermore, some innocuous organic acids like oxalic acid and acetic acid may also appear as the degradation end products [34]."
23,Conclusion,"We successfully synthesized a series of p–n CuO–ZnO heterojunction nano- composites through a straightforward co-crystallization reaction followed by calcination. The morphology of the nanocomposites and the formation of stable chemical bonds between CuO and ZnO were examined via standard techniques such as FE-SEM, HR-TEM, XRD, XPS, FTIR spectroscopy, PL spectroscopy, and UV–vis spectroscopy. We explored the effect of calcination time (while keeping other parameters constant) on the architecture and functional potentials of the CuO–ZnO nanocomposites. The proficiencies of the as-synthesized nanocomposites in the photocatalytic production of H2 via water splitting and in the photodecomposition of MB were evaluated under the visible-light irradiation. A minimal amount (i.e., 20 mg for dye degradation and 50 mg for H2 generation) of the photocatalyst demonstrated robust catalytic action. Among the CZ nanocomposites, CZ-30 revealed the highest activity for the production of H2 (4.094 mmol) via water splitting, whereas CZ-60 and CZ-15 generated 3.916 and 3.471 mmol of H2, respectively, within the observed time of 3 h. In MB degradation analysis, CZ-30 resulted in 98.6% photodeterioration during 80 min of exposure to visible light; CZ-60 and CZ-15 exhibited MB decomposition rates of 94.33% and 88.24%, respectively, within the same time under the same experimental conditions. Because they combine outstanding H2 generation performance and excellent photocatalytic MB dye degradation ability, we expect our synthesized CZ nanocomposites to render a critical role in both sustainable H2 fuel production and environmental detoxification."
