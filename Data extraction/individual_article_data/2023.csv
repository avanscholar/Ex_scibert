0,Introduction,"Chitin is a prominent marine biomass annually occurring in a scale of 1011 ton [1]. Shell waste of crustaceans such as crabs and shrimps are ready source for chitin, practically used in industries. This compound is a pure polymer of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG), which is a nitrogen-containing sugar, and can be degraded into the monomer unit by hydrolysis reactions (Fig. 1 ) [2–5]. These facts make chitin an attractive potential feedstock for the production of organonitrogen compounds as typified by polymers and medicines [6,7]. Conversion of biomass to organonitrogen compounds has been attracting a significant attention in recent years [8–10], and use of chitin is a straightforward way to implement the nitrogen-containing biorefinery. Chemical transformation of NAG has given several organonitrogen compounds that may be useful in polymer and pharmaceutical industries [11–20]. Among them, we focus on 2-acetamide-2-deoxyisosorbide (ADI), which has a condensed five-membered ring and a hydroxy and an acetamide groups that are suited for producing nitrogen-containing polymers (Fig. 1) [20]. The structure of ADI is similar to that of isosorbide, a precursor to the polycarbonate named Durabio that shows remarkable mechanical strength and thermal stability due to its rigid structure [21]. As an analogy, we can expect that introduction of ADI units in polymers would impart good mechanical strength and heat resistance to the products. ADI is synthesized via hydrogenation of NAG to 2-acetamide-2-deoxysorbitol (ADS) and subsequent two-step dehydration (Fig. 1). Brønsted acids catalyze the dehydration reaction and first produce 1,4-, 3,6- and 1,5-anhydro-ADS. Among them, 1,4- and 3,6-anhydro-ADS undergo further dehydration to ADI, whereas 1,5-anhydro-ADS is a by-product. This reaction pathway is analogous to the production of isosorbide consisting of the hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol followed by the dehydration of sorbitol (Fig. S1). The structures of ADS and sorbitol are similar, but the dehydration of ADS is much slower than that of sorbitol. DFT calculations have revealed that the O atom in the acetamide group in ADS molecule traps an acid proton due to its basicity, thus leading to a high activation energy in the dehydration reaction [20]. This issue imposes a high temperature and a long reaction time to complete the dehydration of ADS. Moreover, this reaction produces a large amount of 1,5-anhydro-ADS, viz. low regio-selectivity toward the formation of desired intermediates. As a result, the maximum yield of ADI has been limited to 33 % so far [high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) yield] [20]. The objective of this work is to improve efficiency of the ADI synthesis, for which we add a Lewis acid in the ADS dehydration catalyzed by a Brønsted acid. We hypothesize that a Lewis acid coordinates amide O atoms, thus inhibiting trap of acid protons by the same site. Especially, rare earth triflates have strong Lewis acidity derived from electron-deficient metal cations [22] that coordinate carbonyl O. Indeed, this property has been applied for promoting several catalytic reactions as follows: Dobereiner and coworkers reported that Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling of amides and aryl halides is accelerated by metal triflate co-catalysts [23]. Fu and coworkers represented the promotion of hydrogenolysis of lactones to carboxylic acids using a metal triflate [24]. Additionally, it has been found that the regio-selectivity in the dehydration reactions of sugar alcohols strongly relies on specific structures of the substrates [25,26]. Thus, the coordination of Lewis acid on ADS possibly changes the selectivity. With this idea, this work demonstrates the acceleration of the dehydration of ADS by adding rare earth triflates and proposes possible roles of the Lewis acids based on the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials NAG, diethyl ether (Et2O) and distilled water were purchased from FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation. Lutetium (III) trifluoromethanesulfonate [Lu(OTf)3], Er(OTf)3 and La(OTf)3 were obtained from Aldrich. HOTf, Yb(OTf)3, Tm(OTf)3 and Sc(OTf)3 were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry. ADS was prepared from NAG as reported previously [20]."
3,Conversion of ADS by acid catalysts,"2.2 Conversion of ADS by acid catalysts HOTf was dissolved in Et2O (1 mL) in a two-necked egg-plant flask (borosilicate glass, 100 mL), and then a mixture of ADS (1.00 mmol) and a Lewis acid was added into the solution. After removing Et2O under reduced pressure, the apparatus was equipped with a Teflon-coated thermocouple (ø1.6 mm) and a condenser connected to a rotary pump, and put into an oil bath to keep the reaction temperature at 150 °C for a designated time. After cooling down the glass reactor, water (20 mL) was added to the mixture to analyze soluble products by a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC; Shimadzu, Prominence) equipped with a RPM-Monosaccharide Pb++ column (Phenomenex, mobile phase: water 0.6 mL min−1, 70 °C) and a refractive index detector. Product yield was calculated by an absolute calibration method (error < 0.3 %). Product yield is shown in mole basis to keep yield value unchanged in the presence or absence of acetyl groups. Reproducibility of the reactions was confirmed at a typical reaction condition three times (error < 2 %). 5-O-Acetyl-ADI (ADIAc) was isolated from a reaction mixture by the HPLC fraction collection (retention time 19.8 min)."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on an ECX-600 spectrometer (JEOL). 1H NMR (600 MHz), proton decoupled 13C NMR (151 MHz), distortional enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT), 13C–1H heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), and 13C–1H heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) spectra were measured using 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid sodium salt (DSS) as an external standard. Low-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectra (LR-ESI MS) were recorded on a Shimadzu LCMS-2020 system attached with a Synergi Hydro-RP column. ADIAc: 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 1.97 (s, 3H, NHCOCH 3), 2.11 (s, 3H, OCOCH 3), 3.82 (d, J = 9.6 Hz, 1H, C1–H), 3.84 (dd, J = 4.9, 10.3 Hz, 1H, C6–H), 3.88 (dd, J = 5.5, 10.3 Hz, 1H, C6–H), 3.92 (dd, J = 4.1, 9.6 Hz, 1H, C1–H), 4.38 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, 1H, C3–H), 4.44 (dd, J = 4.1, 7.5 Hz, 1H, C2–H), 4.74 (dd, J = 4.8, 4.8 Hz, 1H, C4–H), 5.12 (dd, J = 4.8, 5.5 Hz, 1H, C5–H), 5.87 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H, NH). 13C NMR (151 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 20.6, 23.1, 56.2, 70.7, 73.0, 74.0, 80.3, 86.6, 169.7, 170.4. LRMS (LR-ESI-TOF) m/z calcd. for C7H14NO6 [M+H]+ 230; found 230."
5,Theoretical calculations,"2.4 Theoretical calculations DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 16 (revision A.03) software at the unrestricted open shell B3LYP/def2-TZVPP/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/def2-SVP/6-31G(d) level of theory, where the Karlsruhe basis sets were applied for metal elements with the effective core potential (def2-ECP) and the Pople ones were chosen for all the other elements [27–30]. We used the fine grid with a 10-digit accuracy for numerical integration to reduce the calculation time. Solvation effect was taken into account by SMD, for which MeOH was used as a solvent model instead of ADS [31]. Gibbs free energy of a structure at 298 K was obtained by the Gaussian’s freq option giving H°, S°trans., S°rot., S°vib. and S°elec., and the accuracy was improved by eqs. 1–4 for the liquid-phase reaction as follows: the pV term in enthalpy (H = U + pV) can be approximated to 0 in liquid phase, thus subtracting p°V gas from the calculated enthalpy for gas phase (eq. 2). The translational entropy was corrected by the free volume theory (eq. 3) [32], where a free volume (V free) was approximately obtained by the cavity volumes calculated based on van der Waals radius at electrostatic scaling factors (α) of 1.0 and 1.2 (eq. 4) [33]. Gaussian provided the cavity volume for one molecule system in the presence of the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) option with specifying α value, and the Avogadro constant was multiplied to be mole basis. (1) G° = H°rev. − T(S°trans,rev. + S°rot. + S°vib. + S°elec.) (2) H°rev. = H° − p°V gas (3) S°trans,rev. = S°trans. + R(lnV free − lnV gas) (4) V free = (V α=1.2 1/3 − V α=1.0 1/3)3 Yb(OTf)3, the main catalyst used in this work, accepts the coordination of multiple ADS molecules [e.g., Yb(OTf)3(ADS)2], but DFT calculations for this system is time consuming. Instead, we replaced one ADS molecule with ethylene glycol (EG) to reduce the calculation cost. For the transition state calculations, the structure of Yb(OTf)3(ADS)(EG) was optimized in advance, and afterward Yb(OTf)3(EG) moiety was frozen during the calculation of reactions occurring on ADS in the complex; otherwise, the structural optimization seldom converged. Atomic coordinates at the transition states are shown in Supporting Information (Tables S1–S4). We found the presence of only one imaginary frequency vibration and the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) [34] connecting expected substrate and product."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalytic reactions,"3.1 Catalytic reactions We performed the dehydration of ADS in the presence of HOTf (Brønsted acid) at a substrate/catalyst (S/C) mole ratio of 2 and rare earth—La, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Sc—triflates (Lewis acid) at a S/C ratio of 10 under neat condition with decreased pressure below 0.1 kPa at 150 °C for one hour (Table 1 ). A controlled experiment without a Lewis acid gave >99 % conversion of ADS, and the products were ADI (22 % yield), mono-anhydro-ADS (21 % in total) and 5-O-acetyl ADI (ADIAc; 9.1 % yield) (entry 1). ADIAc is a newly identified product in this work, using NMR techniques and MS analysis (Figs. S2–S6). The presence of ADIAc indicates the formation of some deacetylated product as a counterpart, which is supported by the MS analysis that has detected deacetylated ADS ([M+H]+, m/z = 182) and deacetylated mono-anhydro-ADS ([M+H]+, m/z = 164). The deacetylated products and unidentified compounds such as humins are denoted “others” in the table (48 %). Addition of metal triflates increased the yield of ADI in different degrees (32–40 %; entries 2–7), and the difference likely correlated with the Lewis acid strength, in other words oxophilicity, of each triflate (Fig. S7). Table 1 provides the relative oxophilicity of metal triflates determined by an MS technique [35] in addition to the catalytic results. La(OTf)3, having the lowest oxophilicity, slightly increased the yield of ADI (32 %; entry 2). More oxophilic triflates (Er3+, Tm3+, Yb3+ and Lu3+) were more promising for this reaction (entries 3–5, 7), among which Yb(OTf)3 gave the highest yield of ADI (40 %). Further increase in oxophilicity was less meaningful, as Sc(OTf)3 gave a similar or lower yield of ADI (37 %; entry 8), compared to Yb(OTf)3. It is also notable that addition of any triflates decreased the yield of 1,5-anhydro-ADS from 17 % to 4.7–9.7 % and that of ADIAc from 9.1 % to 0.8–2.2 %, which contributed to the improvement of ADI yield. Effect of triflates on product selectivity is discussed later in more detail. Based on these results, Yb(OTf)3, possessing the second highest oxophilicity among the triflates tested, was chosen for further study. We have found that Yb(OTf)3 is not very active in the absence of HOTf (entry 6), and therefore the combination of HOTf and Yb(OTf)3 is effective. We studied effect of reaction conditions on the dehydration of ADS in the presence of HOTf and Yb(OTf)3. First, the concentration of Yb(OTf)3 is critical to increase the yield of ADI (Table 2 ). Low concentrations of Yb(OTf)3 (S/C = 50 and 20) gave minor influence on the ADI yield (23 % and 25 %, respectively; entries 10, 11), compared to the reaction in the absence of Yb(OTf)3 (22 % yield, entry 9). Increase in the amount to S/C = 10 and 5 provided ADI in good yields of 40 % and 36 %, respectively (entries 12, 13). A larger amount of Yb(OTf)3 rather decreased the yield to 25 % at S/C = 2 (entry 15). In this case, 1,4-anhydro-ADS and 3,6-anhydro-ADS still remained in 8.1 % yield in total, thus indicating that too much Yb(OTf)3 slows down the dehydration reactions. This inhibition effect might be due to the coordination of Yb(OTf)3 not only on the amide group of ADS and anhydro-ADS but also on their terminal OH groups, namely the sites where protons should bind for the dehydration reactions. To assess this possibility, DFT calculations determined the binding energy of ADS on Yb(OTf)3(EG) complex, in which EG was employed for the convenience (see Experimental). The binding Gibbs free energies (ΔG°) for the amide group and the C1−OH group were −5.9 and −3.5 kJ mol−1, respectively, which were similar (Fig. 2 ). Therefore, it is reasonable that excess Yb(OTf)3 leads to its coordination onto the OH groups in terms of the equilibrium theory [K = exp(−ΔG°/RT)]. Another important fact is that lanthanoid accepts up to nine-coordination in the first coordination shell [36–38], which indicates that multiple ADS and product molecules can bind on a Yb(OTf)3 complex. Thus, compared to the S/C ratio for Yb(OTf)3, a few times larger amount of substrates may bind on Yb(OTf)3. Hence, addition of Yb(OTf)3 at an S/C ratio between 5–10 is the most effective in this reaction. For the temperature effect, a reaction temperature as low as 130 °C gave ADI in 31 % yield and ADIAc in 4.0 % yield with the formation of by-products (1,5-anhydro-ADS 11 %, others 52 %) (Table 3 , entry 16). Increase in the temperature to 150 °C improved the yield of ADI to 40 %, while decreasing yields of 1,5-anhydro-ADS and ADIAc (entry 18). The reduction in ADIAc yield is possibly due to conversion of ADIAc to ADI as discussed later. Further increase in temperature led to the formation of unidentified by-products (Others 59 % at 170 °C, entry 20). Accordingly, the optimal reaction temperature was 150 °C for the production of ADI. We compared the time courses of ADS dehydration in the presence and absence of Yb(OTf)3 to clarify more detailed roles of Yb(OTf)3 in the reaction. The reaction without Yb(OTf)3 (Fig. 3 a,b) consumed ADS completely at 5 min, and produced 1,4-anhydro-ADS (10 %), 3,6-anhydro-ADS (11 %) and 1,5-anhydro-ADS (14 %). Afterward, yield of ADI continuously increased over 180 min, and the maximum yield of ADI was 32 %, almost the same as our previous report [6]. Additionally, ADIAc was produced in 9.1 % yield at 60 min in parallel with ADI. In the presence of Yb(OTf)3 (Fig. 3c, d), ADS was mostly consumed at 5 min, which was similar to the reaction without Yb(OTf)3. However, it is notable that Yb(OTf)3 changed the product distribution among mono-anhydro-ADS: decreasing 1,4-anhydro-ADS (6.4 % yield) and 1,5-anhydro-ADS (4.4 %) but increasing 3,6-anhydro-ADS (15 %). Namely, Yb(OTf)3 enhances the dehydration at C6 position (3,6-dehydration) over that at C1 position (1,4- and 1,5-dehydration), perhaps by binding on ADS. This change in regio-selectivity is useful to decrease the formation of 1,5-anhydro-ADS, a major by-product. Moreover, Yb(OTf)3 accelerated the dehydration of mono-anhydro-ADS to ADI, completing the formation of ADI at 60 min with an improved yield of 40 %. It was not straightforward that the yield of ADI slightly increased after 30 min, when 1,4- and 3,6-anhydro-ADS had already been consumed. We speculate that the acetyl group of ADIAc transfers to deacetylated products to produce two molecules of ADI at maximum in the duration. As mentioned above, the MS analysis has detected deacetylated precursors for ADI production."
8,Energy diagrams for ADS dehydration,"3.2 Energy diagrams for ADS dehydration We employed DFT calculations to clarify the roles of Yb(OTf)3 in this reaction system. Yb(OTf)3(ADS)(EG) complex was used as a starting structure for calculating all reactions for convenience as mentioned above. Our initial hypothesis in this work was that coordination of Yb(OTf)3 on the amide O atom of ADS may prevent the strong binding of proton on the same O atom. In the DFT calculations, free ADS underwent protonation of the amide O atom at a ΔE (sum of electronic and zero-point vibration energies) of −76 kJ mol−1 (Fig. 4 i), whereas the ADS within Yb(OTf)3(ADS)(EG) did at −39 kJ mol−1 (ii-1). Consequently, the complexation of ADS successfully weakened the basicity of amide group, leading the complex to favor the protonation of hydroxy groups (−41 kJ mol−1; ii-2), similar to sorbitol (−43 kJ mol−1; iii). We calculated energy diagrams for the 3,6-dehydration of ADS, the preferred reaction after the addition of Yb(OTf)3. The most stable protonated forms of free ADS (Fig. 5 , blue line) and Yb(OTf)3(ADS)(EG) (red line) transfer protons onto C6−OH to be precursors for 3,6-dehydration, climb the potential energy surfaces to reach the transition states (TS), and eventually give protonated 3,6-anhydro-ADS and water. While the complexation of ADS with Yb lifted the large energy drop in protonation found for free ADS (−41 kJ mol−1 vs −76 kJ mol−1), it only slightly increased the potential energy at the TS to +44 kJ mol−1 from +39 kJ mol−1 for free ADS. Thereby, Yb(OTf)3(ADS)(EG) offered an apparent activation energy 30 kJ mol−1 lower than that given by free ADS. Finally, we compared how much the coordination of ADS to Yb center changes potential energy at the TS in the 1,4- and 3,6-dehydration reactions. The complexation elevated the potential energy by 5 kJ mol−1 for the 3,6-dehydration (Fig. 5; 44 − 39 = 5) and 8 kJ mol−1 for the 1,4-dehydration (Fig. S8). Their difference (3 kJ mol−1) is within error of the theory level employed. Nonetheless we speculate that owing to steric repulsion derived from close proximity between the reaction center (C1) and Yb(OTf)3(EG) on C2 group, the 1,4-dehydration introduces a larger energy barrier. Possibly due to this reason, the addition of Yb(OTf)3 facilitates the 3,6-dehydration at C6 over the 1,4- and 1,5-dehydration at C1."
9,Conclusions,"We conducted the dehydration reaction of ADS in the presence of Brønsted acid and Lewis acid catalysts. The combination of HOTf and Yb(OTf)3 gives 40 % yield of ADI at 60 min, which is superior to the HOTf-only system (32 % yield of ADI at 180 min). Yb(OTf)3 plays two roles in this reaction: first, the acceleration of dehydration reactions to produce ADI, which shortens the reaction time by one third. Yb(OTf)3 coordinates the amide groups of substrates, which prevents the neutralization of protons by the amide groups. DFT calculations have revealed that the apparent activation energy decreases by 30 kJ mol−1 by this manner. The other role is the selectivity change toward the dehydration at C6 position (3,6-dehydration) over that at C1 position (1,4- and 1,5-dehydration). This is useful to reduce the formation of 1,5-anhydro-ADS, a major by-product, thus leading to a slightly higher yield of ADI. We propose that coordination of the bulky Yb complex at amide position possibly increases the steric hindrance for the dehydration reactions at C1. Hence, our method directs toward overcoming the major issues present in the dehydration of ADS to ADI, and these insights would be applicable for the development of efficient catalytic systems for acid-catalyzed reactions of amide-containing molecules."
