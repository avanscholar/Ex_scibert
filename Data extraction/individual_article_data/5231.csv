0,Introduction,"Hydrogels are mostly multicomponent systems consisting of three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers absorbing and retaining a large amount of water without dissolving [1]. Due to its strong water absorption, hydrogels have great potential in various applications including drug release, scaffolds, water treatment and agriculture [1–4]. Also, hydrogel can absorb exudates from wound and offers a moist environment promoting the wound healing which makes it as one of the most suitable material for wound dressings [2,4]. However, most hydrogels are weak and brittle which limits their wide applications in numerous fields needing highly mechanical properties. To resolve this problem, many efforts have been developed to significantly improve the mechanical properties of such hydrogels such as double-network (DN) hydrogels [5], interpenetrating polymer networks (IPN) [6] and nanocomposite hydrogels [7]. Among them, IPN hydrogel can improve not only the mechanical strength but also the compatibility of multicomponent hydrogels [6,8]. Most IPN hydrogels are usually consisted of various natural or synthetic monomers/polymers in order to synergize the best properties of each component to meet the requirements of specific applications [6,8,9]. Chitosan (CS) is a natural biopolymer consisting of amine (−NH2) and hydroxyl groups (-OH) along their chains. CS exhibits good biocompatibility, biodegradability, nontoxicity, antibacterial activity and accelerating character in wound healing [2,4,10]. Hence, CS is very attractive and used in numerous potential applications such as wound dressing, tissue engineering, drug delivery and antibacterial activity [2–4,11]. Polyacrylamide (PAM) is a popular polymer used for preparing the hydrogels with outstanding water swelling capacity [12]. It is made from AM monomers, consisting of the -CONH2- groups which has high chemical activity. Thus, PAM hydrogels have been extensively studied for biomedical applications such as drug delivery systems, antibacterial activity, and blood compatible hydrogel [7,12,13]. Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) is one of the most important and widely applied as biomaterials due to non-toxicity, excellent mechanical properties and good biocompatibility [2,14]. Thus, PHEMA-based hydrogels are employed as biomedical materials, such as in drug delivery systems, contact lenses, and carrier materials for wound healing [9,15]. Owing to its good biodegradability, excellent chemical and mechanical properties, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is widely used to blend with numerous natural/renewable polymers [4,16,17]. Furthermore, PVA hydrogels have been extensively used as biomaterials for biomedical applications due to their ease of processing, biocompatibility, non-carcinogenicity, non-toxicity, superior barrier to oxygen/aroma and excellent film forming and transparency [18,19]. In order to fabricate the hydrogels with antibacterial activity as biomaterials especially for wound dressing, CS - based hydrogels derived either directly from pure CS or CS combined with other polymers have been intensively studied [2,4,5,9–12,19–21]. For instance, self-crosslinking chitosan hydrogels have recently been prepared for biomedical applications via freeze-melting-neutralization method [20]. It exhibited good stimulus-responsive material as controlled drug release, but still had low modulus (< 0.1 MPa). Then, CS hydrogel crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GA) was prepared for drug release and tissue engineering [21] but its swelling was very low (120%). To improve mechanical and swelling properties, blending of CS with other polymers has been suggested. CS/PVA crosslinked by GA showed the improved properties such as high swelling of 190% and tensile stress of 0.6 MPa [19]. Later, hybrid AM/CS hydrogels were synthesized and reported that swelling (>2000%) and modulus in water (< 9 kPa) of hydrogel can be strongly enhanced by AM and CS, respectively [12]. Additionally, double network (DN) and triple network (TN) CS-based hydrogels [5] have synthesized and they showed the higher strength (191 kPa) and excellent antimicrobial activities. Lately, the interpenetrating polymer (IPN) technique has been used to prepare CS/PHEMA hydrogel with improved mechanical properties [1]. Nevertheless, most CS-based hydrogels still suffer from weak mechanical strength especially in wet state and low swelling behavior which may not match with the ideal wound dressing. In the present work, we report the preparation of novel CS-based multicomponent hydrogels derived from the excellent intrinsic properties of AM, HEMA, PVA and CS polymers via the innovative IPN method [2,6,9,22,23] which are expected to exhibit higher mechanical strength, water swelling, surface area and antibacterial activity. Thus, P(HEMA-co-AM)/PVA/CS IPN hydrogels (IPN-CS) containing 0–10 wt% CS were prepared using two-step free-radical polymerization. The effects of addition of CS on the chemical and physical properties, tensile property, swelling ability, morphology and surface area, and antibacterial activity of IPN-CS hydrogels were determined. The correlations between swelling properties, surface area, tensile property and antibacterial efficiency were also examined."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chitosan (CS) (degree of deacetylation >90%), 2-hydroxyethylmathacrylate monomer (HEMA, 97%), acrylamide monomer (AM, 98.5%), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA, 98%), glutaraldehyde aqueous (GA, 25%wt), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 88%) hydrolyzed with molecular weight (Mn) of 85,000–120,000 g/mol were purchased from Acros Organic. Ammonium persulfate (APS, 99%) as initiator, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylendiamine (TMEDA) and HCl as an accelerator were used as received. Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli, ATCC25922) was purchased from department of medical science, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand."
3,Preparation of P(HEMA-co-AM)/PVA/CS IPN hydrogels,"2.2 Preparation of P(HEMA-co-AM)/PVA/CS IPN hydrogels P(HEMA-co-AM)/PVA/CS IPN hydrogels were fabricated by two-step free-radical polymerization (see Scheme 1 ). Firstly, pure CS powder and pure PVA were separately dissolved in each 25 ml of 1% acetic acid solution for 24 h. Then, the CS and PVA solutions were mixed and bubbled with N2 for 1 h. A fixed amount of GA crosslinker (12.5 μL) and HCl (27 μL) were added to the mixed solution and the crosslinking reaction was carried out in thermostatic oil bath at 50 °C for 24 h to obtain the primary networks of CS/PVA solution. Secondly, a fixed weight of HEMA (0.125 g) and AM (1.125 g) monomers, EGDMA (81 μL) as crosslinker, TMEDA (62.5 μL) and APS (28 μL) as initiators were added into the primary networks of CS/PVA solution and continued stirring at 50 °C for 24 h to form the second networks of P(HEMA-co-AM) polymers interpenetrated in the primary networks of CS/PVA. Then, the final mixtures were transferred into petri dishes and dried for 24 h at 50 °C to obtain the IPN-CS hydrogel films which were subsequently immersed in water for 24 h to remove all non-reactive materials and finally dried under vacuum oven at 50 °C. To see the effect of CS addition, the IPN-CS samples adding CS content at 0–10 wt% were synthesized following the feed compositions listed in Table 1 and the sample codes were named as IPN-0%CS, IPN-2.5%CS, IPN-5%CS, IPN-7.5%CS and IPN-10%CS, respectively. It should be noted that the CS content in the final IPN-CS hydrogels may not equal to the feed composition listed in Table 1 because the 100% completed reaction is never obtained in real situation."
4,Characterization of IPN-CS hydrogel films,"2.3 Characterization of IPN-CS hydrogel films The chemical structure of IPN-CS hydrogels was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Spectrum Two, PerkinElmer) with attenuated reflectance (ATR) technique in the range of 4000–600 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) were recorded on a Philips X'Pert X-ray diffractometer (PaNalystical Co., Netherland) using Cu-Kα radiation, and scanning from 5° to 60°. The XRD patterns of IPN-CS films were treated by PowderX program [24]. Then the peak area of XRD patterns was calculated and used to evaluate the degree of crystallinity (X c ). Thermal properties of IPN-CS films were measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Mettler Toledo, DSC 823e). The samples (3–5 mg) were heated from 25 to 230 °C at 10 °C/min under N2 atmosphere. The morphology of the swollen hydrogel films was characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL-JSM 5410 LV). The swollen hydrogel films were freeze-dried to remove the water molecule. Then the sponge was coated with gold using sputtering coater before observation. Also, in order to investigate surface area influenced by CS addition, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of IPN-CS films was measured using a surface and pore size analyzer (Quadrasorb-EVO, Quantachrome Instruments). Finally, tensile tests were performed on a Universal Testing machine (LR Series, Lloyds) with maximum load of 500 N at ambient temperature. The IPN-CS hydrogel films cut into dumbbell shapes (25 mm × 5 mm) with a thickness of 40–50 μm were dried in vacuum oven at 80 °C for 24 h before testing. The samples were stretched at a constant strain rate of 10 mm/min."
5,Swelling properties of IPN-CS hydrogels,"2.4 Swelling properties of IPN-CS hydrogels The dried IPN-CS samples (~1 mm thick, 10 mm × 10 mm) were weighed and immersed in 50 mL of distilled deionized water at room temperature to determine the water absorption kinetics. At a given time, the sample was taken out and wiped with a filter paper to remove the water on the hydrogel surface and weighed. The hydrogel sample was then re-immersed in water again to repeat the above process until the sample weight constants. The swelling ratio was calculated by Eq. (1): (1) Swelling ratio % = m s − m d m d × 100 where m s and m d are the weights of the swollen and dried samples, respectively."
6,Antibacterial activity of IPN-CS hydrogels,"2.5 Antibacterial activity of IPN-CS hydrogels The antibacterial activity of the IPN-CS hydrogel films against Escherichia coli (E. coli, ATCC25922), Gram negative bacteria, which is regularly found on burn wounds, was measured by the viable cell counting method [25]. Briefly, E. coli (100 μL) was cultivated in nutrient broth solution (100 mL) to give a bacterial concentration of ~7 × 1011 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). Then, bacteria/nutrient solution (1 mL) was added to the sterilized nutrient broth solution (0.8%, 9 mL). Several decimal dilutions were performed until the bacterial concentration increased from 7 × 103 to 7 × 107 CFU/mL. Two different concentrations of 7 × 106 and 7 × 107 CFU/mL were chosen for use. The IPN-CS hydrogel films (0.5 g) were cut into circular discs, placed on nutrient agar dishes that had been inoculated with bacteria, incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, imaged and counted the numbers of the surviving colonies. These results were compared to the numbers of bacteria colonies of the untreated control that had not been exposed to the hydrogel films."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synthesis of IPN-CS hydrogels,"3.1 Synthesis of IPN-CS hydrogels This work aims to fabricate the novel IPN-CS hydrogel films by using two-step polymerization as shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, the primary networks of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/chitosan (CS) were crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GA). This reaction generated the crosslink points by acetal bridges (C-O-C) and Schiff bases or imine bonds (C=N) where GA reacted on PVA (-OH groups) and CS (-NH2 groups) chains, respectively [26]. In the second step, P(HEMA-co-AM) copolymers were formed, then interpenetrated into the primary networks of PVA/CS and finally, chemically crosslinked by ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) to generate the novel P(HEMA-co-AM)/PVA/CS IPN hydrogels (IPN-CS). To study the effect of CS content, a series of IPN-CS hydrogels prepared using different CS contents of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 wt% with respect to total weight of monomers/polymers were synthesized and represented by IPN-0%CS, IPN-2.5%CS, IPN-5%CS, IPN-7.5%CS and IPN-10%CS, respectively."
9,Structural characterization by FTIR spectroscopy,"3.2 Structural characterization by FTIR spectroscopy The chemical structures of pure PVA, pure CS, monomers of AM and HEMA and their IPN-CS hydrogels were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 1 , particularly, to observe the changes in the molecular structure in the IPN-CS hydrogels. As already indicated, the IPN-CS hydrogels were synthesized by two-step polymerization. In order to verify whether the primary networks of PVA/CS crosslinked by GA were successfully formed, the gel of 90wt%PVA/10wt%CS crosslinked with GA was thus synthesized to prove such chemical structures. Fig. 1A shows the FTIR spectra of CS film, PVA film and the PVA/CS/GA hydrogel. Pure CS exhibited the characteristic peaks ranging between 3672 and 3000 cm−1 which correspond to the overlapping of O-H/N-H stretching vibration mode [19]. The CO stretching (amide-I), NH bending (amide-II), -C-N stretching (amide-III) and NH out of plane of CS were indicated by peaks at 1631, 1538, 1335 and 649 cm−1, respectively. Also, the -CO stretching vibration of CS was identified at 1067 and 1020 cm−1 [17,19]. For pure PVA, a strong band located at 3675–3000 cm−1 corresponded to a typical strong -OH band for the inter/intramolecular hydrogen bonds [27]. Moreover, the band at 1728 cm−1 and shoulder at 1650 cm−1 corresponded to the CO and CO stretching, respectively, from the unhydrolyzed acetate groups [19]. The FTIR spectrum of PVA/CS gel crosslinked by GA (middle curves) showed a significant decrease in the band intensity at 3660–3000 cm−1 compared to both CS and PVA spectra. Compared with CS spectrum, a simultaneous drop on the imines (-C=N-) bands was detected which is the evidence of interactions between amino groups of CS and GA called Schiff base formation verified by the peaks at 1538 (υ -NH2) and 1643 (υ CN) cm−1 [26]. Besides, the bands at 1063 and 1026 cm−1 associated with O-C-O acetal bridges after crosslinking of PVA with GA were increased in absorbance. Another peak located at 650 cm−1 (NH out of plane of CS) was also decreased after amino groups was crosslinked with GA. This results is in good agreement with recent works [17–19,26,27]. Therefore, it could be confirmed that the primary networks of PVA/CS were successfully formed by GA crosslinker. To establish the IPN hydrogel, the second networks were further created by crosslinking reactions of P(HEMA-co-AM) chains using EGDMA crosslinker in the presence of the primary network of PVA/CS solution (see Scheme 1; step 2). To see the effect of CS addition, IPN-0%CS hydrogel (no CS) was also prepared for comparison. Fig. 1B presents the FTIR spectra of PVA film, neat HEMA, neat AM and the IPN-0%CS hydrogel. The IPN-0%CS spectrum was the combination of pure PVA, neat AM, and neat HEMA spectra but there were slightly shifted peaks compared to neat polymers. Moreover, a broad band at 3600–3000 cm−1 was the overlapping vibrations of -OH/-NH stretching of PVA and PAM and the decrease in absorbance of this band also indicated the effect of chemical crosslinking reagent. This produced acetal groups (C-O-C) due to the crosslinking of PVA with GA formed as first network which was observed at 1050 cm−1 [17–19]. In addition, a new peak at 1090 cm−1 was observed which associates with the CN stretching vibrations of P(HEMA-co-AM) crosslinked with EGDMA [28]. This evidence could confirm that the P(AM-co-HEMA)/PVA hydrogel (IPN-0%CS) was successfully synthesized. Fig. 1C presents the IPN-CS spectra with different CS contents. It is seen that the characteristic curves of all IPN-CS spectra were similar to the IPN-0%CS spectrum. Also, it is observed that a band at 1750–1570 cm−1 become broader. A peak of Schiff bases (C=N) was found at 1658 cm−1 (amide I) due to the crosslinking formation of amino groups of CS and aldehyde group of GA [17–19,26]. A band at 1090 cm−1 was attributed to the CN stretching of the P(HEMA-co-AM) crosslinked with EGDMA [28,29] and a shoulder peak located at 1050 cm−1 was associated with acetal groups (C-O-C) caused by the chemical crosslinking of PVA with GA [17–19]. By increasing CS content, the peak at 1152 cm−1 (the C-O-C vibration of glycosidic linkage) and peak at 1253 cm−1 (complex vibration of NHCO group) were also observed and increased in absorbance [30]. This result indicates that the IPN-CS hydrogels with different CS contents were successfully synthesized. To get more insight, the intensity ratio of 1253 cm−1 to 1325 cm−1 (used as internal standard) is plotted in Fig. 1D. With increasing CS content, the ratio of intensity is gradually increased, indicating the more CS fraction contained in the IPN-CS hydrogels. As apparent in Fig. 1D, the color of IPN-0%CS film was transparent, but the IPN-CS samples were darker yellow with increasing CS content [31]. Furthermore, the IPN-5%CS hydrogel film presents the smoother surface and better film formation than other samples."
10,XRD analysis,"3.3 XRD analysis X-ray diffraction (XRD) is an effective tool used to examine the degree of crystallinity and the microstructure of polymeric materials [32]. The XRD patterns of pure CS, pure PVA and all IPN-CS hydrogel films are presented in Fig. 2A. The pure CS pattern shows a single reflections at 20.3o (2θ), indicating a semi-crystalline nature of CS [33], while PVA exhibits the semi-crystalline structure with a sharp reflection at 19.5o and a shoulder peak at 22.6o [34]. The IPN-0%CS hydrogel shows a relative broad peak at 19.8o with very low intensity and the disappeared peak at 40.7o compared to pure PVA. This implied the drastic decrease in crystallinity of PVA which could be due to the interpenetrating and intertwining between PVA chains after the formation of IPN hydrogel [18]. By addition of CS, the XRD patterns of IPN-CS hydrogel films are slightly different from IPN-0%CS (see red oval). They present two peaks at 19.5o and 20.3o which overlap each other as clearly seen in the IPN-5%CS. Moreover, at low CS contents (2.5-5%wt), the intensity of the overlapping peak seems to increase with addition of CS content. This indicates that PVA and CS chains could have more interactions and would result in the increase in crystallinity compared to IPN-0%CS. However, with increasing more CS content (7.5–10 wt%), the XRD patterns become broader and lower intensity compared to IPN-2.5%CS and IPN-5%CS, leading to a marked decrease in crystallinity. Fig. 2B demonstrates the plot of degree of crystallinity of IPN-CS hydrogels. It is seen that the crystallinity of IPN-0%CS (7.3%) is much lower than to that of pure PVA (29.1%) and pure CS (18.2%). With incorporation of CS, the IPN-CS hydrogels have more crystallinity compared to the IPN-0%CS and the maximum crystallinity (14.4%) is found in the IPN-5%CS sample. This result corresponds well with tensile strengths. Nevertheless, the crystallinity of all IPN-CS samples is still lower than that of pure PVA and pure CS which is in line with other PVA/CS blend systems [19]. The decrease in crystallinity of crosslinked networks of PVA/CS based systems was accounted for the crosslinking effect which hinders the movement and rearrangement of polymer chains [18,19,26]."
11,DSC analysis,"3.4 DSC analysis The thermal properties of IPN-CS hydrogel films were investigated by DSC technique as shown in Fig. 3A. Glass transition (Tg) and melting (Tm) temperatures of the samples were also identified. DSC curves of pure PVA and IPN-CS hydrogels exhibit three zones consisting of Tg, a small endothermic peak (the Tm of new crystalline regions [19]) and Tm zones, respectively. Pure CS shows a very broad endothermic peak ranged from 40 to 140 °C, relating to the enthalpy of vaporization of the water bound in the CS structure. Therefore, Tg and Tm values of CS were not observed in our work while other literature reported to be 93 °C [35]. Pure PVA exhibits the Tg and Tm at 72.2 and 201.4 °C, respectively. For the IPN-0%CS, Tg and Tm were found at 65.4 °C and 179.1 °C, respectively, which are markedly dropped from those of pure PVA. This means that IPN-0%CS was a softer material compared to PVA film which corresponds well with the XRD pattern showing an amorphous structure with very low crystallinity (7.3%). The significant reduction in Tg could attributed to the chemical crosslinks provided by a partial crystallization of PVA chains and thus increases the free volume throughout amorphous regions or possibly reduces the hydrogen bonding in the same amorphous domains [36]. By incorporation of CS, the Tg and Tm of IPN-CS hydrogels seemed to increase with increasing CS content (Fig. 3B), which is similar to other work [37]. The maximum Tg was found in the IPN-5%CS (70.5 °C) sample. The increase in Tg and Tm could be related to the higher hydrogen bonding between PVA and CS chains in the IPN-CS hydrogel compared to IPN-0CS, resulting in the decrement of flexibility and the increment of compatibility of IPN-CS hydrogels [38]. This result agrees well with the decrease in elongation at break. Moreover, the area of Tm endothermic peak of IPN-CS hydrogels is gradually increased with CS content up to 5 wt% then slightly dropped which is in good agreement with the %crystallinity (see Fig. 2B). This result correlated well with the significant increase in mechanical strength of the IPN-CS hydrogels. On the contrary, in other PVA/CS crosslinked systems, the Tg and Tm of their blends were reported to be further decreased with increasing CS portion due to the partial miscibility between PVA and CS [39]."
12,Morphology and surface area of IPN-CS hydrogels,"3.5 Morphology and surface area of IPN-CS hydrogels To be used as wound dressing, the porous structure of the materials is one of the requirements which could facilitate the absorption of extrudate and the permeation of gas. The surface morphologies of freeze-dried swollen IPN-CS hydrogels are observed using SEM technique as displayed in Fig. 4 . It is seen that all IPN-CS hydrogel films showed the porous three-dimension structure with a relatively uniform pattern. The SEM image of IPN-%0CS hydrogel (no CS) revealed a porous structure with a large pore size, indicating that its network was loose due to the weak interactions between network chains [10]. By increasing CS contents, the number of porous structures and the pore size on the IPN-CS hydrogels tends to increase and decrease, respectively, which is similar to other work [39]. The pore size of IPN-0%CS is around 10 μm while that of IPN-10%CS is only about 4–5 μm which can be classified to be microporous hydrogels [40]. To get more insight into surface area after addition of CS, BET experiment was carried out and the results showed that the surface area (A) of IPN-CS hydrogels displayed a good linear relationship with increasing CS content, followed by equation: A (m2/g) = 1.62 CS(wt%) + 92.64, R2 = 0.966, as presented in Fig. 5B. Thus, it can be concluded that addition of CS caused the increase in both porous structures and surface area of the IPN-CS hydrogel which is the good characteristics for wound dressing application."
13,Swelling behavior and swelling kinetics of IPN-CS hydrogels,"3.6 Swelling behavior and swelling kinetics of IPN-CS hydrogels In general, swelling properties under in vitro test are of dominant key role for prospective evaluation of biomaterials. Several factors such as the crosslinking density, the hydratability of materials, the ionic strength and pH of the aqueous media, the environment temperature can markedly result in the swelling capacity of hydrogels [31]. Fig. 5A shows the swelling behaviors of IPN-CS hydrogels in distilled water. The swelling ratio of all IPN-CS hydrogels increased sharply during the initial period (t < 6 min) and then started to level off. The equilibrium swelling (S eq ) is seen to significantly increase with increasing CS content, which is consistent with the PVA/CS IPN hydrogels reported by Kim et al. [41]. The S eq of IPN-CS hydrogels containing 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 wt% CS was found to increase about 17.6, 29.0, 42.1 and 57.3%, respectively, compared to IPN-0%CS hydrogel (620%). Furthermore, the S eq of IPN-CS hydrogel increased linearly with CS content, which can be described by a linear equation; S eq (%) = 34.48 CS (wt%) + 629 (R2 = 0.994), see Fig. 5B, suggesting the swelling enhancement of IPN-CS hydrogels by 34.48% per 1 wt% CS. In order to get more insight into the surface area influencing the S eq of IPN-CS hydrogels, the relation between surface area versus S eq was plotted as shown in Fig. 5C. It is seen that the S eq is good linearly related to the surface area of the IPN-CS hydrogel, suggesting that the increase in S eq of the IPN-CS hydrogel was concurrently influenced by the increase in surface area of the IPN-CS films. The increase in S eq and surface area of IPN-CS hydrogels might be attributed to the higher hydrogen bonding and/or more interactions in the IPN-CS networks after more hydrophilic groups in CS chains were incorporated [41]. Therefore, it can be suggested that addition of CS improve significantly the swelling capacity and surface area of the IPN-CS hydrogels, which are important parameters for evaluating their applications in wound dressing [2]. Swelling kinetics is one of the most fascinating characteristics accountable for the efficiency of water absorption [42]. When a hydrogel polymer contacts with a fluid, this fluid propagates thoroughly the polymer matrix via the existing spaces or voids formed by the locally segmental movements of the polymer network, followed by the local relaxation of the polymer chains [43]. This phenomenon leads to the swelling of hydrogel. The swelling mechanism is then characterized by the propagation and relaxation times of the polymer [44]. The swelling kinetics of IPN-CS hydrogels in distilled water were evaluated by using the well-known models including the pseudo first-order model (Eq. 2) and the pseudo-second-order model, so-called Schott's model (Eq. 3) [21]: (2) S t = S eq 1 − e − k 1 t (3) S t = S eq 2 k 2 t 1 + k 2 S eq t where S eq and S t (%) are water swelling of the hydrogel at equilibrium and any time t (min), respectively, k 1 (1/min) and k 2 (1/%.min) are the swelling rate constants of pseudo-first-order and Schott's models, respectively. To obtain the kinetic parameters more accurately, we applied the non-linear method instead of the linear method by using OriginPro 2018® program for preventing any linearization errors in the correlation coefficients (R 2 ). The non-linear fitting plots of both models for IPN-CS hydrogel samples are presented in Fig. 5D and the adsorption kinetic parameters are listed in Table 2 . As observed in Table 2, S eq,cal values for the pseudo-first-order model are very closed to S eq,exp values for all the IPN-CS hydrogels rather than Schott's model. Furthermore, the R 2 values for the pseudo-first-order model (0.995–0.998) are higher than those of Schott's model (0.965–0.990). Therefore, the pseudo-first-order model is more suitable to describe the water swelling kinetics of the IPN-CS hydrogels. In general, the swelling rate constant (k) depends on various factors such as the balance of hydrophobic/hydrophilic, rigidity/flexibility and the degree of crosslinking [45]. As seen in Table 2, the k 1 values of the IPN-CS hydrogels tend to increase significantly with increasing CS contents, especially in CS ≥ 5 wt%, because the more fractions of hydrophilic CS chains lead to higher reactivity of the hydrogel with water [41]. This result suggests that addition of more hydrophilic CS polymer chains could promote water molecules to easier diffuse into the IPN-CS networks resulting in the more relaxation of polymer chains [7]. Fundamentally, the swelling mechanism could be characterized by diffusion and relaxation time of the charged networks. In most cases, the initial phase of variation in hydrogel volume follows zero-order swelling kinetics instead of second-order kinetics [44]. Consequently, to study the diffusion behavior of water molecules in the networks of IPN-CS hydrogels, the power law model was developed as the following [46]: (4) F = M t M ∞ = Kt n where F denotes the swelling power of the gel network or fractional uptake at time t, while M t and M ∞ are the mass of water absorbed at time t and equilibrium, respectively, and K (min -n ) is a diffusion constant depending on the gel structure and the permeation medium, n is the diffusional exponent indicating the type of swelling mechanism. The n value describes the diffusion type into the polymer, where n = 0.5, indicates Fickian diffusion, i.e. the diffusion rate of the solvent molecules is much less than the mobility of polymer chains. While, 0.5 < n < 1 suggests a non-Fickian diffusion which occurs when the movement of solvent and the relaxation rates of polymer chain are equivalent and can be used to describe solvent diffusion behaviors for any polymer–penetrant system at all the temperatures and the penetrant activities [46]. If n = 1.0, it reveals a case II transport, where the solvent diffusion rates are much faster than the relaxation processes of polymer chains, whereas at n > 1.0, the transport mechanism is a type of super case II. Fig. 6A shows the plot of F versus time (t), which yields a good non-linear fitting with high correlation coefficients (R 2 > 0.99). This suggests that the water diffusion behavior into the IPN-CS hydrogels obeys the power law model very well which is similar to other works [41,44,45]. The calculated values of n for IPN-CS samples containing 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 wt% CS are 0.65, 0.63, 0.60, 0.52 and 0.51, respectively, implying a non-Fickian diffusion which the water diffusion rate and polymer chain relaxation are about the same order of magnitude (See Fig. 6B). Moreover, it is found that the n values decrease closely to n = 0.5 (Fickian diffusion) with increasing CS content. This indicates that the relaxation rate of IPN-CS polymer chains tends to increase with increasing CS content, which could be resulted from the more hydrogen bonds of CS chains with water molecules, and then such waters act as plasticizer [46]. This result is in good agreement with the result obtained from the PVA/CS IPN hydrogels [41]. On the contrary, the diffusion constants (K) of the IPN-CS hydrogels are found to increase clearly from 0.286 to 0.461 with increasing CS content as presented in Fig. 6B, which coincide with the significant increase in S eq values as shown in Fig. 5B. Therefore, this result may have benefited greatly from the higher hydrophilicity of the IPN-CS networks incorporating with more CS fractions."
14,Tensile properties and crosslink density of IPN-CS hydrogel films,"3.7 Tensile properties and crosslink density of IPN-CS hydrogel films It is known that the CS-based hydrogels with suitable mechanical properties are prerequisite for an ideal wound dressing. Therefore, tensile strength and elongation at break of the IPN-CS hydrogel films containing 0–10 wt% CS contents were studied as presented in Fig. 7A. It is seen that the tensile strengths (TS) of IPN-CS hydrogel films remarkably increase with the increase in CS content up to 5 wt% and then gradually drop. The drop in TS was probably due to inhomogeneous crosslinking of CS and PVA, agglomeration of CS and also lower crosslinked density of hydrogel [5,10,32,34]. The ultimate TS of the IPN-2.5%CS and IPN-5%CS samples are observed to be 12.9 and 22.5 MPa, respectively, while that of the IPN-0%CS hydrogel is only 8.4 MPa. This means that the presence of 2.5 and 5 wt% of CS substantially increases the TS of IPN-CS hydrogels more than 1.5 and 2.7 folds, relative to the IPN-0%CS hydrogel, respectively. This result agrees well with other works [10,12,32,34,38] and also confirms that incorporation of CS can improve the mechanical strength of the IPN-CS hydrogel films [5]. Additionally, it was also found that the tensile strengths of the obtained IPN-CS hydrogels in this work are significantly higher those of double network (DN) hydrogel of chitosan/poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) (292 kPa) and triple network (TN) hydrogel of chitosan/zwitterionic sulfopropylbetaine/poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) (131 kPa), reported by Zou and coworker [5]. They also noted that the DN and TN hydrogels showed the higher strength and toughness than chemically crosslinked chitosan and poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) single hydrogels. Compared to the hydrogel films without CS (IPN-0%CS), the elongation at break (EB) of the IPN-CS samples tends to decrease with increasing CS contents. With increasing CS from 2.5 wt% to 10 wt%, the EB of IPN-CS hydrogels decreased linearly from 27% to 85%, compared to IPN-0%CS. This result implies that, by incorporation of more CS contents, the IPN-CS hydrogel films in a solid state gain less flexibility and lower elongation at break which is consistent with the work reported by Zhen, et al. [34]. To relate the tensile strength and crosslinked density (XD) of IPN-CS hydrogels, the crosslinked density of IPN-CS crosslinked hydrogels was evaluated by the Flory-Rhener theory [47,48] using the following equation: (5) XD = M c M r where M c is the average molecular weight between interpenetrating polymeric networking of P(HEMA-co-AM)/PVA/CS IPN hydrogels, which represents the degree of cross-linking of hydrogel networks between two adjacent crosslinks and M r is molar mass of the repeat units consisting in the IPN-CS hydrogel. According to this theory, M c values increase as the swelling ratio of hydrogels increased. The values ofM c can be calculated by using the eqs. (6) [48]: (6) M c = − d p V s V 2 , s 1 / 3 − V 2 , s 2 ln 1 − V 2 , s + V 2 , s + χ V 2 , s 2 where, V 2, s and V s is the volume fraction of swollen hydrogel in equilibrium state (mL/mol) and the molar volume of solvent (18.0 mL/mol), respectively. The V 2, s indicates the capacity of hydrogel allowing the diffusion of solvent into the network structure which can be calculated by Eq. (7): (7) V 2 , s = 1 / 1 + d p d s m s m d − 1 where d p and d s are densities (g/mL) of the hydrogel and solvent, respectively, m s and m d are the masses (g) of the swollen and dry hydrogels, respectively. While,χ is the Flory-Huggins polymer (hydrogel) - solvent interaction parameters [48] and can be calculated by the following equation; (8) χ = ln 1 − V 2 , s + V 2 , s V 2 , s 2 By measuring thed p of each IPN-CS hydrogel using pycnometer, and obtaining the values of m s and m d by swelling measurement, V 2, s of each IPN-CS hydrogel can be firstly obtained. Then χand M c are consequently calculated. To calculate the XD of the IPN-CS hydrogels, M r , the molar mass of the repeat units in IPN-CS hydrogel is needed to be calculated from Eq. (9): (9) M r = m HEMA M HEMA + m AM M AM + m PVA M PVA + m CS M CS + m GA M GA + m EGDMA M EGDMA m HEMA + m AM + m PVA + m CS + m GA + m EGDMA where m HEMA , m AM ,m PVA ,m CS , m GA , andm EGDMA are the masses of the monomer (HEMA, AM), polymer (PVA, CS), and crosslinker (GA, EGDMA), while M HEMA ,M AM ,M PVA ,M CS ,M GA and M EGDMA are the molar masses of HEMA, AM, PVA, CS, GA and EGDMA, respectively. The XD values of the IPN-CS hydrogels were finally evaluated, and the results are plotted in Fig. 7A. The XD values for IPN-0%CS, IPN-2.5%CS, IPN-5%CS, IPN-7.5%CS and IPN-10%CS were calculated to be 0.82, 0.93, 1.22, 0.94 and 0.86, respectively. It is seen from Fig. 7A that XD values were influenced by CS content which were well coincident with the values of calculated crystallinity and tensile strength. Therefore, the remarkable improvement in TS of the IPN-5%CS hydrogels could mainly due to the marked increase in crosslinked density [49], chain interactions and hydrogen bonds between CS chains and PVA and P(HEMA-co-AM) segments [34,38] and also the increase in crystallinity (see Fig. 2) and Tg (see Fig. 3)."
15,Antibacterial properties of the IPN-CS hydrogel films,"3.8 Antibacterial properties of the IPN-CS hydrogel films The antibacterial activity of IPN-CS hydrogel films on the growth of the recombinant bacteria E. coli (ATCC 25922) was tested by using the viable cell-counting method as shown in Fig. 7B. After the colony-forming unit per milliliter (CFU/mL) was measured and calculated, it was found that the IPN-0%CS sample grew more colonies (2.04 × 109 CFU/mL) which was almost closed to that of the control sample (2.24 × 109 CFU/mL). The efficiency of antibacterial activity of IPN-0%CS sample is evaluated to be only 8.9%, indicating poor antibacterial activity. Fascinatingly, by incorporation of CS just only 2.5 wt%, the antibacterial activity of IPN-2.5%CS hydrogel film was significantly improved and exhibited an excellent efficiency (99.99%). Furthermore, in other IPN-CS hydrogels such as IPN-5%CS, IPN-7.5%CS and IPN-10%CS, the excellent antibacterial activity of IPN-CS hydrogels (99.99%) was also obtained. In addition, the antibacterial activity of IPN-2.5-5%CS hydrogels, in this work, was also similar to the remarkably antimicrobial activities of DN1 (91.99%) and TN1 CS-based hydrogels (99.96%) against E. coli [5] and corresponded well with other works [25,50,51]. Fundamentally, the mechanism of the antibacterial activity of chitosan is known to be based on the interactions of polycations (protonated –NH2 groups) of chitosan (CS) with the negatively charged surfaces of bacteria leading to the loss of membrane permeability, cell leakage, and finally cell death [52]. Consequently, this result suggests that the IPN-CS hydrogel with CS content ≥2.5 wt% has significantly bactericidal effect, demonstrating the superior antibacterial activity of the CS in the IPN-CS hydrogel films. The excellent antibacterial activities of the IPN-CS hydrogels with low CS content (2.5–5 wt%) against gram-negative bacteria make them a promising candidate for wound dressing materials with low production cost. Finally, to evaluate the optimum IPN-CS sample for antibacterial wound dressing applications, the correlation between mechanical strength, water swelling, and antibacterial activity was generated in 3D-plot as shown in Fig. 7C. As can be seen from Fig. 7C, the optimum IPN-CS hydrogel films as a great potential wound dressing should be the IPN-5%CS film due to its high mechanical strength with suitable flexibility, high water absorbency, high surface area and microporous structure, as well as excellent antibacterial ability."
16,Conclusion,"The novel P(HEMA-co-AM)/PVA/CS IPN hydrogel films (IPN-CS) with improved mechanical properties, water swelling kinetics, surface areas and antibacterial activities were successfully fabricated by two-step free radical polymerization. The formation mechanism of the IPN-CS hydrogels was proposed and confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. The incorporation of CS improved significantly the crystallinity, Tg and Tm of IPN-CS hydrogels. The IPN-CS hydrogel films presented microporous structures with progressively decrease in pore diameter with increasing CS, leading to high surface area. The water swelling behavior of IPN-CS hydrogels were also enhanced significantly by the addition of CS and obeyed very well with pseudo-first order kinetic model and non-Fickian diffusion. The addition of CS led to less flexibility of IPN-CS hydrogel in solid state but increased the relaxation rate of polymer chains after water adsorption. The mechanical strength of IPN-CS hydrogel increased significantly with increasing CS content up to 5 wt%. Moreover, the IPN-CS hydrogels containing CS content ≥2.5 wt% exhibited an excellent antibacterial ability against gram negative E. coli. Based on the optimum results, it could be suggested that the IPN-5%CS hydrogel film having high tensile strength with suitable flexibility, high water absorbency, high surface area and excellent antibacterial activity has the potential to be used as promising biomaterials for wound dressings."
