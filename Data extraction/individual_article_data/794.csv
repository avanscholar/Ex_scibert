0,Introduction,"The amount of fossil fuel used has been increasing day by day since it is the key and dominant source for all energy systems present in the world. The demand for it is being increased by the increased level of necessity to run the systems [1]. So far petroleum is the most efficient and reliable energy source [2]. It is because of the best opted nature of it for various purposes. Mainly petroleum fuels are used for the transportation vehicles to run its engines. IC engines are the prime mover for all transportation vehicles [3,4]. While thinking its positive effect such as economy growth and production and use of efficient systems, it also has negative consequences [5]. The excess energy usage leads to the exploitation of the fossil fuel. Not only the depletion but also the harmful gases emission which is the main cause of the greenhouse effect, climatic change and damage in the ozone layer. Considering these all-present issues and negative consequences, the immediate transition from fossil fuel to one which is less harmful is obligatory [6–9]. A lot of research has been going on the biofuel production and performance improvement of the same. This is because the environmentally friendly nature and continuous availability of the sources of biofuel as well as the performance is also good. Mainly, the biofuel does not emit much harmful gasses to the environment thus leads to the greatest research interest among the other alternate to make [10,11]. In general, the sources of biofuel are generously spread over the world. As such there will not be any depletion in the sources for the uninterrupted supply of biofuel [12]. The common biofuel sources are sugar, starch and oils. The sugar highly present in sugarcane, sweet sorghum and sugar-beet. The starch form as corn and cassava and oils as palms, coconut, rapeseed, sunflowers and soybeans [13,14]. Plenty of research have proved it clearly that the emission characteristics of biofuels are good by reducing the emission of environmentally harmful gases [15]. However, the emission rate is reduced, to improve the performance many attempts have been tried. Among all the attempts made, the addition of catalyst is proved to be the better method to further improve the performance of the biofuels at various concentration (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ). The purpose of catalyst is to improve the quality of biofuel [16,17]. The ultrafine particles range in size from 1 nm to 100 nm are added to the biofuel at different proportions to achieve certain quality [18,19]. Despite the fact that the quality of the biofuels increased to some point, still further more improvement in performance and quality is required. Once the research of making the alternate fuel in the form of biofuel which is also equivalent to the diesel, it is possible to increase the overall economic growth as well as protect the environment by biofuels [20]. There are a lot of proves by many research papers for its efficient usage. The research is upgraded by adding different nanoparticles and other catalyst in the biofuel blends. The addition of hydrogen has given the new hope to improve the quality of biofuel even better. Because of all amendments made in biofuel, the usage amount of it has been increased over the past few years. While the production of biofuel in 2000 was 16 billion litres, it was 110 billion in 2013 [21]. The production rate has been increasing steadily every year due to upgraded biofuel. Further the role of nanoparticles was immense clear. Addition of the nanoparticles enables the better performance despite the application [22,23]. Hence the current study also focuses on the nanomaterials to the biodiesel. The present research concentrates mainly on the addition of energy efficient hydrogen flow incorporated with different biofuels [24]. The quality of the biofuel is expected to be increased significantly by the mixing of hydrogen flow. Hydrogen gas is used in many sectors such as petroleum refining, fertilizer production and transportation. Hydrogen is a clean fuel and can be produced from biomass, nuclear power, natural gas and renewable sources of solar power and wind. Hydrogen acts as an energy carrier and improves the performance of the base fuel. By thinking that the hydrogen can be a single clean fuel, it can also be used to boost the other fuels."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biofuel production – Waste cooking oil biofuel,"2.1 Biofuel production – Waste cooking oil biofuel Lower viscosity biofuel is produced by using the transesterification process. This is a chemical reaction in which the fats (triglycerides) present oil and feedstock is converted into biodiesel. The triglycerides are reacted with the alcohol when there is a catalyst such as bases, acids and enzymes. The product produced by the transesterification is called alkyl esters which can be used as fuel. The by-product obtained is the glycerol which can be used again to initiate the transesterification process [25]. The reaction inside the reactor has two steps. During the first step, the alcohol and catalyst are mixed with the oil. The alcohol added in the first step is only 80%. After this reaction, the product is sent to the process of removing the glycerine. Once the glycerine is removed by the precipitation tank, the remaining 20% of the alcohol is added. Water is added to filter the esters from the transesterification products [26]."
3,Addition of nanoparticles,"2.2 Addition of nanoparticles The nanoparticles added with the biofuel is the TiO2 titanium dioxide due to its non-toxic nature and the energy surface area is also high in this metallic catalyst. The proportion of the catalyst is varied such as 10% and 20%. The fuels taken for the test are D100, B10, B20. The nanoparticles added biofuel proportions are The fuel blends used for the tests were D100 (pure diesel), B10 (90% diesel + 10% biofuel), B20 (80% diesel + 20% biofuel), D100T10 (pure diesel with 100 ppm nanoparticles), B10TH (90% diesel + 10% biofuel with 100 ppm nanoparticles + 5 L/min of H2) and B20T10 (80% diesel + 20% biofuel with 100 ppm nanoparticles + 5 L/min of H2)."
4,Hydrogen supply,"2.3 Hydrogen supply The pure hydrogen is filled in the hydrogen tank to provide the supply of hydrogen in the biofuel blends with nanoparticles. The pressure maintained in the tank is 170 bar. Hydrogen regulator was used to adjust the flow into the engine to get the accurate results at different rate of flow [27,28]. The hydrogen flow maintained at the constant flow rate of 5 L/min."
5,Experimental tests,"2.4 Experimental tests All tests were conducted in the four stroke and single cylinder compression ignition engine which was water cooled. After getting the nanocatalyst mixed biofuel, the preparation for conducting experimental tests was started by running the CI engine for 10 mins without any fuel to get the clear results. All tests were carried out for different fuel blends such as D100, B10, B20, DT, B10TH and B20TH. The engine was connected to the dynamometer. In that setting, AVL gas analyzer was used to get the emission characteristics for each test and this analyzer was also connected to the computer which collected the test data [21]. The performance measuring system was installed in the computer to get the performance data. The filter was used to improve the quality of the hydrogen gas supply. The data calculation was done by using data logger by transferring the data to the computer system. The properties of the fuel blends are listed in Table 1 . All the tests were conducted at different engine speed ranging as 1800 rpm, 2200 rpm, 2400 rpm and 2700 rpm (Table 2 and Table 3 )."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Performance characteristics,"3.1 Performance characteristics 3.1.1 Engine torque The engine torque produced by all test fuels D100, B10, B20, DT, B10TH and B20TH. From Fig. 3 it is clear that when the speed of the engine is increased, the produced torque is reduced. It is because of the incomplete combustion at higher speed and also at higher speeds the air intake is disturbed. As a result, the increased pressure reduces the torque at high speed. On the other hand, the amount of torque produced by the 5 lit/min hydrogen supply to the fuel blend of B10TH at lower speed of 1800 rpm was higher than other fuel blends as 21.3 N-m. The torque produced by the fuel blends of D100, B10, B20, DT, B10TH and B20TH at the low engine speed are 21.5 N-m, 20.1 N-m, 19.5 N-m, 21.8 N-m, 21.3 N-m, and 20.5 N-m. Compared to the regular blend’s addition of the hydrogen and TiO2 improvised the engine torque by 6% and 5% for B10TH and B20TH compared to B10 and B20. This depicts that addition of the hydrogen and nanoparticles enhanced the torque produced by the engine [29,30]. As the engine speed increased, the torque dropped massively. For instance, at 2800 rpm the loss of the torque for the blends D100, B10, B20, DT, B10TH and B20TH were 24%, 27%, 28%, 28%, 26% and 27% compared to lower engine speeds. This massive reduction in torque due to the loss of the thermal efficiency. 3.1.2 Brake thermal efficiency (BTE) The values of the BTE are shown in Fig. 4 for all fuel blends D100, B10, B20, DT, B10TH and B20TH at different engine speeds of 1800 rpm, 2200 rpm, 2400 rpm and 2700 rpm. The general fact which can be understood from the figure is the engine speed increment reduces the BTE similar to engine torque pattern. For the fuel blends without hydrogen and nanoparticles addition, the D100 produced the highest BTE than B10, B20 at 1800 rpm. The BTE for pure D100 was 24% while B10 and B20 were 21.5% and 21%. For the fuel blends with the addition of nanoparticles with hydrogen supply as DT, B10TH and B20TH at 1800 rpm were 24.2%, 22% and 21.6% respectively. The biofuel blend B10 with the maximum nanoparticles-hydrogen addition produced the highest BTE value among others. This due to the lower viscosity obtained by the mixing of nanoparticles and hydrogen. The higher diffusivity and high speed of the flame of the hydrogen is the reason for the higher BTE [31]. Moreover, the quenching distance is also lower for hydrogen. Besides that, the nanoparticles also play an important role in increasing the BTE. The higher amount of oxygen and lower viscosity are also the reason for a complete combustion leading to the BTE increment. The BTE values for the fuel D100, B10, B20, DT, B10TH and B20TH at 2400 rpm and 2700 rpm were reduced gradually but in each speed with the maximum hydrogen supply with nanoparticles provided the higher values (Fig. 5 ). 3.1.3 Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) The opposite effect to the BTE is obtained for the BSFC. As the speed increases, the BSFC is increased. Apart from that, with the plain fuel blends D100, B10 and B20 at 1800 rpm, the BSFC values were 422 g/kWh, 380 gr/kWh and 360 g/kWh. The specific fuel consumption for B20 was the minimum value. While the percentage of the TiO2 particles and hydrogen increment, the BSFC was even reduced at all speeds. Especially for the fuel blend B20TH produced the much lower value of BSFC as 349 g/kWh. Initially the BSFC values were lower for D100, B10, B20, DT, B10TH and B20TH (422 gr/kWh, 380 g/kWh, 360 g/kWh, 401 g/kWh, 370 g/kWh and 349 g/kWh), as the engine speed increased the BSFC witness significant rise in the consumption of fuel [32,33]. The decrement in BSFC is achieved because of the complete combustion and higher heating value provided by the mixing of nano particles and hydrogen. Since the brake specific fuel consumption is lower for B20TH, it is more economical than diesel with higher hydrogen supply or even without any mixing as pure diesel [30]."
8,Emission characteristics,"3.2 Emission characteristics Figures shown below give the different emission rates of CO, CO2 and NOX for the fuel blends of D100, B10, B20, DT, B10TH and B20TH at different engine operating speed of 1800 rpm, 2200 rpm, 2400 rpm and 2700 rpm. It is vital to measure the emission rates of the fuel so as not to increase the green-house effect. 3.2.1 CO emission Fig. 6 shows the value of CO emission at different speeds as 1800 rpm, 2200 rpm, 2400 rpm and 2700 rpm for different fuel blends D100, B10, B20, DT, B10TH and B20TH. From figure it is evident that the amount of CO is reduced due to the addition of hydrogen and nanoparticles. This is because the higher the biofuel amount, the higher the oxygen content will be [34]. Oxygen content by the biofuel, the lower viscosity when added with nanoparticles and higher diffusivity and flame speed of the hydrogen addition are increased the clear combustion rate without any un-burnt fuel. The un-burnt fuel components are also the reason for the CO emission. In addition to it, the hydrogen does not have the structure of carbon leading to less CO emission. The high energy surface area of the TiO2 is also the reason to provide full combustion. On the contrary, as the speed increases, the CO emission was also increased. At 1800 rpm, the CO level of fuel blends D100, B10, B20, DT, B10TH and B20TH were 0.081, 0.045, 0.063, 0.08, 0.046 and 0.39 %vol respectively. With the hydrogen supply the emission of CO values were higher than conventional blends of B10 and B20. Compared to B10, the blends with hydrogen B10TH reported 2% rise in production of hydrogen. On the other hand, the B20TH reported 25% less emission of CO than B20 which is purely due to the complete combustion of the fuel. The reduction in the amount of CO was large when the biodiesel concentration was higher. In an average of 26% CO was reduced when hydrogen was added with the biofuel blends and also with pure diesel. 3.2.2 CO2 emission Fig. 7 illustrates the CO2 emission with respect to different engine speed. As the speed increases, the CO2 emission is also increased but at one particular speed, CO2 emission for the fuels without hydrogen and nanoparticles addition as D100, B10 and B20 were higher than the hydrogen and nanoparticles added biofuel blends and also clean diesel [35]. For example, at 1800 rpm, the CO2 emission of D100, B10 and B20 were 4.2 %vol, 3.8 %vol and 3.5 %vol while the CO2 emission of D100T, B10TH and B20TH were much lower than the plain fuel blends and the values were 4 %vol, 3.7 %vol and 3.5 %vol. From the findings it is evident that as the engine is run at high speed, the higher amount of complete combustion leads to the increment in the emission of CO2 similar to CO [32]. The reason behind the increase of the emission is due to the carbon content in the biodiesel blends. By adding the hydrogen into the biodiesel reduced the emission of CO due to the absence of carbon molecules in hydrogen gas [36]. 3.2.3 NOX emission Nitrogen oxides emission for the fuel blends of D100, B10, B20, DT, B10TH and B20TH at different engine operating speed of 1800 rpm, 2200 rpm, 2400 rpm and 2700 rpm. It also gives the same understanding that when the speed increases the emission of NOX also increases. It is because the increased combustion temperature. Not only with the speed but also with the addition of hydrogen, the NOX emission is increased [37]. This is because the higher calorific value of the hydrogen leading to the high cylinder temperature. When the cylinder temperature is maximum, the NOX emission is also higher than at lower temperature [36,38]. The plain fuel of D100, B10 and B20 NOX emission were 220 ppm, 350 ppm and 560 ppm respectively, whereas the hydrogen and nanoparticles added fuel blends of B10TH and B20TH reported reduction in NOx of 20 ppm and 30 ppm than B10 and B20. The main thing to consider here is the temperature rise for the emission of NOX (Fig. 8 )."
9,Conclusion,"In an attempt to find the best alternate to fossil fuel, the waste cooking oil biodiesel was taken and it was enriched with hydrogen and nanoparticles together at different proportions and at different speeds. The performance and emission characteristics were measured for all fuel blends to find the better proportion to specific effects of the same. The fuel blends taken for conducting all tests were D100, B10, B20, DT, B10TH and B20TH at different engine operating speed of 1800 rpm, 2200 rpm, 2400 rpm and 2700 rpm. The results are listed below • The performance qualities were increased by the addition of nanoparticles and hydrogen such as brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and torque. The increased BTE level from pure form of D100, B10, B20, DT, B10TH and B20TH was in the average of 1.8. The causes for the complete combustion provided by the addition of hydrogen and nanoparticles are the higher oxygen content and lower viscosity of nanoparticles addition and the main one is the high diffusivity and flame speed of the hydrogen. • The BSFC was also reduced for the hydrogen and nanoparticles added fuel blends. The values of the BSFC for D100, B10 and B20 were higher than the enriched fuel blends. The higher the combustion rate, the lower the specific fuel consumption. • On comparing the emission characteristics, it is proved vividly that the enriched biofuel reduces the harmful gas emission such as CO and CO2. Complete combustion produced by the addition of hydrogen and nanoparticles and high energy surface area and zero level carbon content in the hydrogen are the reason for the reduction in CO and CO2 rate. On the contrary, the NOX emission was increased because of the high cylinder temperature. Overall, it is justified that the biodiesel quality is upgraded by the addition of hydrogen and nanoparticles."
