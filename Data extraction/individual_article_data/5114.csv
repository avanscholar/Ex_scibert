0,Introduction,"Recently, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution on semiconductors has received extensive attention with the depleting of the fossil fuels and resulted environment pollution [1–5]. However, due to ultra-low activities of bare semiconductor, it is necessary loading some co-catalysts on semiconductor to obtain more efficient photocatalyst [6–8]. Generally, co-catalyst has a low over-potential, transfers rapidly the photo-excited electron from semiconductor and acts as a reactive active site of hydrogen production, thus enhancing the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron and hole of the semiconductor, and improving the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst. According to cost and material types,co-catalysts can be divided into expensive noble metal co-catalysts and low-cost earth-rich material co-catalysts. Since the noble metals with high cost and small earth reserves are not conducive to industrialization [9,10], the earth-abundant material co-catalysts especially based on Mo, W, Co, Ni have been developed and received much attention [11–20]. The two kinds of co-catalysts should not be isolated, and it is of great meaning to exploring the high efficiency essences of the two kinds of co-catalysts. Our group focuses on co-catalysts and develops a series of new efficient and cheap co-catalysts [21,22]. Furthermore, integrating the two different kinds of co-catalysts, we reported a high efficient composite co-catalyst Pt/Mo2C with ultra-low amount of Pt (0.006 %) and confirmed the different roles between noble metal and earth-abundant material co-catalyst in photocatalytic H2 evolution [23]. The noble metal mainly acts as reactive active sites to catalyze protons reduction, while the non-noble metal co-catalyst mainly stores photoexcited electrons from semiconductor due to its large specific capacitance. It is no doubt that integrating noble metals and earth-abundant co-catalysts on semiconductor will succeed in obtaining more efficient photocatalyst, however, the relationship between the structures and activities of a photocatalyst should be further clarified. Especially, it is of great significance to illuminate the essential relationship between the assembly ways of a photocatalyst and the transferring paths of the photo-excited electrons. WC is a non-noble metal earth-abundant material. At present, it has been extensively applied to electro-catalyst support [24], oxygen reduction and evolution [25–28], hydrogen evolution [29], methanol oxidation [30], electrochemical sensors [31] and photocatalytic H2 production [32] etc. Here, using CdS as host semiconductor, WC and Ru as probes of two kinds of co-catalysts respectively, we design two photocatalysts (Ru / WC) / CdS and Ru / (WC / CdS) via adopting different assembly methods. The (Ru / WC) / CdS shows better activity than Ru / (WC / CdS). The different transferring paths of photo-excited electrons are clarified and account for their photocatalytic activities."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All materials were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Na2S9 H2O, Na2SO4, and lactic acid were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). WC and RuCl3 were obtained from Shanghai Aladdin Industrial Co., Ltd. Cd (NO3)24 H2O was obtained from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

3,Synthesis of (Ru/WC) material,"2.2 Synthesis of (Ru/WC) material (Ru / WC) was synthesized by traditional wet impregnation method. Briefly, different amount of aqueous solution of 1.0 mg / mL of Ru using RuCl3 as Ru precursor were impregnated on the surface of WC (0.2 g), the mass ratios of Ru to WC are 0.01 %, 0.1 %, 1%, 5%, and 10 % respectively. The samples were reduced in the H2 flow of 20 mL / min at 300 ℃ for 1 h."
4,"Synthesis of CdS, WC/CdS, (Ru/WC)/CdS, Ru/(WC/CdS) and Ru/CdS","2.3 Synthesis of CdS, WC/CdS, (Ru/WC)/CdS, Ru/(WC/CdS) and Ru/CdS CdS was synthesized by precipitation and then hydrothermal method [13]. Detailly, 2.7 g cadmium nitrate dissolved in isopropanol solution. Subsequently, the 60 mL of 0.14 mol / L of Na2S was dropwise added under vigorously stirring at room temperature and then aged for 8 h. The obtained yellow sediment was transferred into a 100 mL sealed teflon-lined autoclave, and then kept at 180 ℃for 24 h. Last, the deposit was filtered by distilled water and ethanol several times and then dried at 90 ℃ for 6 h in vacuum drying oven. For the preparation of WC / CdS, a certain amount of WC was ultrasonically dispersed in 50 mL of cadmium nitrate solution, and stirred for 20 min until the dispersion is uniform. Then, adding 60 mL sodium sulfide aqueous (0.14 mol / L) solution dropwise under stirring for 60 min. After standing for 8 h, transferring to a 100 mL high-pressure hydrothermal reactor at 180℃ for 24 h. Finally washing the precipitation 3 times and drying in a vacuum drying oven at 80℃for 12 h to obtain WC / CdS. For the (Ru / WC) / CdS, a certain amount of (Ru / WC) ultrasonically was dispersed in 50 mL cadmium nitrate solution (0.14 mol / L), and stirred for 20 min. The following steps are same to that of WC / CdS. The Ru / CdS photocatalysts were prepared by in situ photo-deposition method [13]. Typically, different amount of aqueous solution of Ru (1.0 mg / mL) using RuCl3 as Ru precursor were impregnated on the surface of 0.1 g of CdS via photodeposition method using 10 % lactic acid aqueous solution (100 mL) as scavenger agents and 300 W Xe lamp (Perfect, China) with 420 nm filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) as light resource for 1 h irradiation, the deposit was filtered by distilled water and ethanol three times and then dried at 60 ℃ for 12 h in vacuum drying oven. For the preparation of Ru / (WC / CdS), the method is same as that Ru / CdS, except WC / CdS instead of CdS."
5,Characterizations,"2.4 Characterizations The structures of WC/CdS were determined by X-ray diffractometry (D / MAX2500, Rigaku, Japan) at room temperature at a voltage of 4 kV under Cu-Kα radiation. The High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and TEM images were taken on a transmission electron microscope (F20 / G20) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) analyses at 200 kV and the high-angle annular dark-field scanning HAADF-STEM. The UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS) was obtained using a spectrometer (U-4100) equipped with a calibrated baseline BaSO4. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded at room temperature with a luminescence spectrofluorometer (FluoroMaX-4) using a Xe lamp emitting at 400 nm as excitation source."
6,The photocatalytic activity of H2 evolution,"2.5 The photocatalytic activity of H2 evolution The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments were performed in a closed system (Perfect, China) of evacuation and gas circulation with a quartz cell. A 300 W Xe lamp (Perfect, China) with a 420 nm filter was used as visible light source. In detail, 0.1 g of sample was dispersed in an aqueous solution (100 mL) containing 10 mL lactic acid. The reaction system was pumped to vacuum for 30 min and continuous access to circulating condensate before irradiation. The hydrogen gas was analyzed by a gas chromatographic equipped with a TDX-01 column and TCD detector, using Ar as the carrier gas."
7,Photoelectrochemical and electrochemical measurements,"2.6 Photoelectrochemical and electrochemical measurements Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical testing were carried out on an electrochemical work station (CHI 760D, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd, China) in a standard three-electrode system with the sample-coated FTO film [33] or foam Ni film as the working electrode, a SCE (saturated calomel electrode) as a reference electrode, and a Pt sheet as the counter electrode. 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrolyte. The photoresponses were studied under a 300 W Xenon lamp with a UV cutoff filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). Constant current charge and discharge (CP) of the samples were carried out using the sample-coated foam Ni as the working electrode [34]. The specific capacitance is calculated according the formula of C = I * ( T 2 - T 1 ) m Δ E , Where C (F) is the total capacitance, I / m (A / g) is Current density, ΔE (V) is the electrochemical window, (T2 - T1) (s) is the Single charge and discharge interval [35]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,"Photocatalytic H2 evolution on WC / CdS, Ru / CdS, and (Ru / WC) / CdS","3.1 Photocatalytic H2 evolution on WC / CdS, Ru / CdS, and (Ru / WC) / CdS Fig. 1 a shows the XRD patterns of CdS loading with different amount of WC. When the loading amount of WC (PDF #51−0939) is larger than 3.0 %, WC diffraction peaks can be distinguished apparently. Fig. 1b shows the photocatalytic activities of H2 evolution on WC / CdS with different amount of WC. It can be seen WC is an effective earth-abundant co-catalyst greatly improving the photocatalytic activities of CdS. At the optimum loading amount of WC of 10.0 %, the photocatalytic activity reaches 1250 μmol / h, which is 29.8 times of bare CdS. Fig. 1c shows the effect of the noble metal Ru on the photocatalytic activity of CdS. Ru is an effective co-catalyst. At the optimum loading amount of 0.1 %, the Ru / CdS show the highest activity of 870 μmol / h, which is 20.7 times bare CdS. From the Fig. 1b and c, the co-catalyst can greatly enhance the bare semiconductor, whatever the kind of co-catalysts is. Fig. 1d shows the photocatalytic activities of (Ru / WC) / CdS with different amount of Ru. It can be seen the composite co-catalyst (Ru / WC) is more efficient than WC (or Ru) alone. The optimum photocatalytic activity is 16.8 mmol / h / g, which are 1.93 and 1.34 times of that optimum Ru / CdS and WC / CdS, respectively. To further explore more efficient composite co-catalysts and the difference between Ru and WC, the new composite co-catalyst (Ru / WC) was integrated and loaded on CdS for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Fig. 1e shows the TEM image of (Ru / WC). It can be seen the Ru particles on the surface of bulk WC. Fig. 1f shows HRTEM image of (Ru / WC) loaded on CdS. The lattice fringes of WC with interplanar distance of 0.18 nm is indexed to the (101) plane of WC, while the lattice fringes with the plane spacing of 0.29 and 0.23 nm are attributed to the (200) plane of CdS and the (100) plane of Ru, respectively. The stability of (Ru / WC) / CdS was shown in Fig. S1."
10,"Electrochemical performances of WC, and Ru/WC","3.2 Electrochemical performances of WC, and Ru/WC Fig. 2 displays the electrochemical performances of Ru / WC and WC. From the Fig. 2a, at the cathode current density of -10 mA / cm2, the over-potentials of Ru / WC and WC are -0.3 and -0.4 V, respectively, which indicate that Ru favors the reduction of H+ to H2. Fig. 2b shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EIS) of Ru / WC and WC. The radius of the EIS curve of Ru / WC is apparently smaller than that of WC, which indicates the loading of Ru on WC improves the conductivity of WC due to the metal properties of Ru. The higher conductivity of Ru / WC is favor of the photo-excited electrons transferring from CdS to the co-catalysts, thus enhancing the photocatlytic activity. Fig. 2c shows the constant current charge and discharge curves for the two co-catalysts. WC has a longer charge-discharge cycle than Ru / WC. The specific capacitances of the two co-catalysts are calculated as CRu / WC = 11.58 F / g and CWC = 14.60 F / g, respectively. Obviously, WC has larger specific capacitance, which benefits for storing photo-excited electrons from CdS. Tafel analyses are shown in Fig. 2d to elucidate the mechanism of hydrogen production kinetics. (Ru / WC) has a smaller Tafel slope (153.33 mV / dec) than WC (167.67 mV / dec), which means more efficient of hydrogen production of (Ru / WC) due to the Ru loading."
11,Photocatalytic hydrogen production on Ru/(WC/CdS),"3.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen production on Ru/(WC/CdS) To further explore effect of the assembly way of photocatalyst on the photocatalytic activity, the Ru / (WC / CdS) was prepared via photo-deposition of Ru on WC / CdS. Fig. 3 a shows the photocatalytic activities of Ru / (WC / CdS) with different amount of Ru. When the amount of Ru is ultra-low (0.001 %), the photocatalytic activity of Ru / (WC / CdS) is almost same as that of WC / CdS. With the increase of the amount of Ru, the photocatalytic activities of Ru / (WC / CdS) gradually decrease. Interestingly, when the amount of Ru reaches and over 0.5 %, the photocatalytic activities of Ru / (WC / CdS) are almost equivalent to that of Ru / CdS and WC doesn’t seems to work. Here, the Ru shows harmful to the WC / CdS for the photocatalytic H2 evolution. Integration with Fig. 1d, it is easily deduced that there are difference between (Ru / WC) / CdS and Ru / (WC / CdS) in the photo-excited electron transferring paths. In (Ru / WC) / CdS, the Ru and WC jointly use the photo-excited electrons and show the synergic effect on activity due to Ru confined on the surface of WC. While in Ru / (WC / CdS), the Ru and WC show a competitive relationship for the use of the photo-excited electrons as Ru deposited mainly on the surface of CdS (Ru reducing is very easy). Due to the metal properties of Ru (high conductivity, low overpotential), the Ru is superior to WC in use of photo-excited electron, thus, Ru overwhelms WC and Ru / (WC / CdS) shows the same activities as Ru / CdS at higher amount of Ru (0.5 % and 1.0 %). Also, it is worth noting that between (Ru / WC) / CdS and Ru / (WC / CdS), different Ru particle sizes may cause the differences of photocatalytic activities. However, we think compared with the effect of electron transfering pathes, the effect of differences of Ru particle size is small due to the low loading amounts of Ru."
12,Electrochemical (photoelectrochemical) and spectral performances of CdS loaded with different co-catalysts,"3.4 Electrochemical (photoelectrochemical) and spectral performances of CdS loaded with different co-catalysts Fig. 3b shows the photocurrent responses curves of CdS loaded with different co-catalysts. When CdS is combined with co-catalysts, all photocurrents are significantly enhanced compared with the bare CdS. (Ru / WC) / CdS shows the maximum photocurrent. Interestingly, the photocurrents of Ru / (WC / CdS) and Ru / CdS are almost same. Generally, by loading co-catalysts on semiconductor, the photo-generated electron of semiconductor can transfer into co-catalysts. So the semiconductor loaded with co-catalysts shows higher photocurrent than the semiconductor alone. Here (Ru / WC) / CdS has the largest photocurrent, which means the most efficient co-catalyst of (Ru / WC). The property of (Ru / WC) is related to large specific capacitance of WC (Fig. 2c) and large catalytic ability of Ru (Fig. 3c). The almost same of the photocurrents of Ru / (WC / CdS) and Ru / CdS indicates that the photogenerated electrons are mainly transferred to Ru other than WC. Therefore, Ru / (WC / CdS) exhibits the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity comparable to that of Ru / CdS. Fig. 3c shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements. The Ru is a kind of noble metal, which can apparently decrease the overpotential of the CdS, and the overpotential of Ru / CdS is minimal, indicating that Ru mainly plays a role of catalyzing hydrogen production. WC also slightly decreases the overpotential of CdS indicating the lower catalyzing ability of hydrogen evolution compared with Ru. Interesting, compared with (Ru / WC) / CdS and Ru / (WC / CdS), their overpotentials are adjacent and that the Ru / (WC / CdS) is slightly lower. So the overpotential is not the key factor to affect their activities. However, according to their great difference in activities and prepared methods, the WC and Ru play different roles and the photo-exited electrons from CdS transfer different paths in photocatalytic H2 evolution. Fig. 3d shows the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of different photocatalysts. CdS has a largest semicircle which means the weak charge transportation ability of CdS. Loading co-catalyst on CdS can enlarge the semicircle and enhance the conductivity of the photocatalyst. The semicircle of Ru / CdS is the smallest, which means the largest charge transportation ability due to the metal conductor properties of Ru. The semicircle WC / CdS is largest except that of CdS, which means the limited improvement of the conductivity of CdS. Ru / CdS and Ru / (WC / CdS) exhibit similar radius of semicircle, which means their similar electron transferring abilities and paths and WC looks like no use in transferring electrons. The (Ru / WC) / CdS and Ru / (WC / CdS) show different radius of semicircles which means their different electron transferring abilities and paths. Fig. 3e shows the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the bare CdS and the CdS loaded with different co-catalysts. The bare CdS with an absorption edge at 575 nm shows a band gap of about 2.16 eV [36]. The co-catalysts loadings hardly change the band gap of CdS except for the enhancing intensities of tail absorptions after 600 nm. Fig. 3f shows the PL spectra of CdS loaded with different co-catalysts. Compared with bare CdS, All of the fluorescence intensities decrease after the co-catalyst loaded on CdS. The (Ru / WC) / CdS shows the smallest fluorescence intensities, which means the strongest inhibition of the recombination of the photo-excited electrons and holes in CdS and thus shows the largest of the photocatalytic activity [37]."
13,The photo-excited electrons transferring paths and the photocatalytic H2 evolution mechanisms of the Ru-WC-CdS photocatalysts assembling with different methods,"3.5 The photo-excited electrons transferring paths and the photocatalytic H2 evolution mechanisms of the Ru-WC-CdS photocatalysts assembling with different methods Scheme 1 shows the proposed mechanism of integrated photocatalysts Ru - WC - CdS for photocatalytic H2 production, the photo-excited electrons transferring paths are also presented. Scheme 1 (a) depicts the mechanism of (Ru / WC) / CdS for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Here, Ru is loaded on the surface of WC to form a composite co-catalyst (Ru / WC). Under visible light irradiation, the CdS is excited. At the valence band of CdS, holes can oxidize lactic acid to produce lactate oxide. Meanwhile, the photo-excited electrons in the conduction band of CdS move to the WC and then into the Ru for photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction. WC has a large specific capacitance and can store much more photo-excited electron, thus greatly inhibiting recombination of the electrons and hole in the CdS. Ru has low overpotential of H2 evolution, thus improving the electrons reduction H2O to pruduce H2. The Ru and WC play synergistic roles, the (Ru / WC) / CdS show the most efficient photocatalyt for H2 evolution. Scheme 1b shows the mechanism of Ru / (WC / CdS) for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Here, Ru is photo-deposited on the surface of (WC / CdS), in fact mainly on the surface of CdS, and has strong abilities for transferring electrons. As shown in scheme 1b1, when the loading amount of Ru is ultralow, most of the photo-excited electrons from CdS transfer into WC. And at the surface of WC, the H2 reduction reaction occurs. In this moment, Ru / (WC / CdS) shows almost the same activities as that of (WC / CdS). As shown in scheme 1b2, when the loading amount of Ru is middle, some electrons transfer into Ru for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Other electrons transfer into WC (or and then to Ru which is deposited on WC) for photocatalytic H2 evolution. The Ru / (WC / CdS) shows the activities equaling to the sum of that a part of Ru / CdS and a part of WC / CdS. So, here, the Ru and WC show competitive relations for using the electrons. Due to the low efficient of Ru compared with WC for photocatalytic H2 evolution, the Ru / (WC / CdS) shows the activities lower than that of WC / CdS. As shown in scheme 1b3, when the loading amount of Ru is overlarge, most of electrons transfer into Ru for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Apparently, Ru has an advantage over WC for transferring electrons due to the strong metal conduction property and low over-potentials for H2 evolution, and the WC seems invalidity for the capturing electrons. Here, the Ru / (WC / CdS) shows the activities almost same as that Ru / CdS."
14,Conclusions,"Two photocatalysts (Ru / WC) / CdS and Ru / (WC / CdS) are designed by changing the assembling methods. The (Ru / WC) / CdS is most efficient and shows 16.8 mmol / h / g of H2 evolution, which is 1.93 and 1.34 times of that Ru / CdS and WC / CdS, respectively. Amazingly, the Ru shows harmful to WC in H2 evolution in Ru / (WC / CdS). When the loading amount of Ru is overlarge (over 0.5 %), the Ru / (WC / CdS) even shows almost the same activity as Ru / CdS. Electrochemical characterizations demonstrate the Ru transfers electrons rapidly and acts as a catalytic active center for hydrogen generating, and WC has a large specific capacitance and act as a reservoir for collecting and storing photo-excite electrons from CdS. The activity difference between the Ru / (WC / CdS) and (Ru / WC) / CdS is originated from the different transferring paths of the photo-excited electrons. For (Ru / WC) / CdS, the photo-excited electrons are clarified from CdS to WC and then to Ru in turn. For Ru / (WC / CdS), the Ru has an advantage over WC in competitive transferring electrons from CdS. This study gives guidance on assembling composite co-catalysts on semiconductor for photocatalytic H2 evolution."
