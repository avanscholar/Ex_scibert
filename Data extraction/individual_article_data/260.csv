0,Introduction,"The utilization of fossil fuels lead to severe environmental pollution and greenhouse effect. Therefore, research into renewable energy sources is very important. Hydrogen is considered as a promising energy carrier of the future due to its high calorific value of 122 kJ/g and the rapid development of fuel cell technology (Martinez-Burgos et al., 2021). However, most of hydrogen is now produced from fossil fuels - mainly through the steam reforming of methane, so it is far from being renewable (Nagarajan et al., 2019). These methods are highly energy intensive and pollute the environment by emitting carbon, sulfur and heavy metals to the atmosphere (Łukajtis et al., 2018). Thus, it is necessary to search for other sustainable methods of H2 production, so it could become green energy carrier with no carbon emission. Biological production of hydrogen is an emerging approach to clean and sustainable fuel. It involves several methods such as: direct biophotolysis, indirect biophotolysis, dark fermentation, photofermentation and bioelectrolysis. Especially, dark fermentation has been of great interest due to its high H2 production rates and a potential to utilize a wide range of waste biomass as a substrate (Hassan et al., 2020). Lignocellulosic material seems to be particularly attractive, because it is renewable, has high carbohydrate content and its annual worldwide production is exceeding 220 billion tons (Wang and Yin, 2018). Cellulose is the major component of lignocellulose biomass. However, due to its rigid and complex structure it is difficult to release carbohydrate constituents, which could be utilized by fermentative microbes (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017). In fact, most of the research on the production of hydrogen from cellulose-based biomass was preceded by a pretreatment stage to enhance its digestibility (Patel et al., 2021; Sołowski et al., 2020). Pretreatment technologies can be classified as physical, chemical, physiochemical and biological (Zabed et al., 2019). Since pretreatment is an additional step it could increase the overall process cost. Furthermore, some treatments may result in the formation of inhibitory compounds that decrease H2 production (Wang and Yin, 2018). Consolidated bioprocessing is an alternative, which involves direct utilization of raw substrates. During this highly integrated one-step process specific bacteria produce enzymes responsible for cellulosic biomass hydrolysis, while the other microorganisms take part in converting released carbohydrates into H2 (Nagarajan et al., 2019). Minimizing the number of steps makes the process more economical. Mixed bacterial cultures (like anaerobic sludges) can produce enzymes showing a wide range of hydrolytic and catabolic activities and thus are capable of utilization of complex substrates, but often require an appropriate enrichment (Rabelo et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2010). Therefore, it is desirable to obtain a stable hydrogen-producing cellulose-degrading mixed bacterial culture and to identify the microorganisms involved in the process. Especially, because the yields obtained by pure cultures are usually low (Ren et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2015). Literature on hydrogen production from raw cellulose is rather limited. The reported H2 yields are usually below 1 mol H2/molhexose, while theoretical maximum is 4 mol H2/molhexose (Hassan et al., 2020). More specific research on optimization of the process parameters is therefore required. Several parameters affect fermentative H2 production such as pH, temperature, the type and concentration of substrate as well as microbial culture composition (Wang and Wan, 2009). The type and the concentration of the substrate have been extensively studied, but there is no consensus on the optimal values for batch cultures, because they depend on specific conditions of the process (Song et al., 2013; Sreela-or et al., 2011). Temperature is another important factor, because it affects enzyme activity, the growth rate of bacteria and metabolic pathways of substrate utilization. Buffering capacity of the medium plays a vital role during fermentative H2 production, especially when the bioreactor has no pH control unit. The role of the buffer is to alleviate the drop in pH during fermentation caused by production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) such as acetic and butyric acid (Wang and Wan, 2009). The pH conditions directly impact activity of the enzymes participating in metabolic processes as well as the composition of mixed bacterial culture (Łukajtis et al., 2018). A number of investigations examined the effect of initial pH on H2 production in batch experiments. However, only a few studies analyzed the impact of buffer concentration on dark fermentative process carried out with optimum initial pH (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017; Phowan and Danvirutai, 2014). The present work investigates the effect of cellulose concentration, temperature and buffer concentration on dark fermentative hydrogen production by mixed bacterial culture. A traditional one-factor-at-a-time design is incapable of reaching a true optimum, because it does not take into consideration the interactions among process variables. Thus, the process was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM), which is a useful statistical tool for analyzing complex biological processes (Gadhe et al., 2014). In addition to optimizing hydrogen production, research should focus on maximizing the substrate utilization to reduce the post-process wastes which may be difficult to manage. Therefore, in the current study cumulative hydrogen production (CHP) and substrate conversion efficiency (SCE) were chosen as the process responses. Ren et al. (2010) reported high H2 yields from cellulose, but did not reported composition of the microbial consortium. Identification of microorganisms responsible for cellulose degradation and hydrogen production in the mixed culture is crucial. Thus, in this study the effect of the process parameters on microbial community structure and the resulting production of soluble metabolites was analyzed. In majority of studies cellulosic substrates were pretreated before H2 production process. Therefore, the purpose of this study was enrichment of the mixed bacterial culture on cellulose, without previous pretreatment, along with adapting it to achieve high efficiencies of hydrogen production."
1,Material and methods,
2,Seed sludge and preparation of inoculum,"2.1 Seed sludge and preparation of inoculum Bacterial culture used during this study was obtained from anaerobic digester sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (Poznań area, Poland). Full scale anaerobic digestion reactor was treating primary and waste activated sludge. Anaerobic digester sludge is a common bacteria source for dark fermentative H2 production (Łukajtis et al., 2018; Park et al., 2014). The sludge was pretreated at 100 °C for 15 min to promote spore-forming hydrogen-producing bacteria and inhibit methanogenic activity (Kim et al., 2020; Mohammadi et al., 2011). Heat treated sludge was inoculated into the basal medium containing cellulose to enrich bacteria capable of cellulose degradation. The basal fermentation medium was a modified DSMZ 520 medium and consisted of (per 1 L): KH2PO4 2.45 g, K2HPO4 2.1 g, MgCl2·6H2O 0.165 g, NH4Cl 0.2 g, FeSO4·7H2O 0.05 g, NaCl 0.1 g, CaCl2·6H2O 0.1 g, cellulose 5 g, peptone 1 g, yeast extract 1 g, L-cysteine-HCl·H2O 0.25 g, microelements 1 mL. Microelements solution contained (per 1 L): ZnCl2 0.07 g, MnCl2·4H2O 0.1 g, H3BO3 0.06 g, CoCl2·6H2O 0.19 g, CuCl2·2H2O 0.01 g, NiCl2·6H2O 0.024 g, NaMoO4·2H2O 0.036 g. Microcrystalline cellulose (Aldrich – particle size 51 μm) was used as carbon source. The culture was shaken in anaerobic conditions at 150 rpm and 32 °C. Seven rounds of cultivation were performed – each generation of batch cultures served as the inoculum for the next process (repeated batch). Then, the stable bacterial culture was used as the inoculum for the H2 production experiments."
3,Hydrogen production experiments,"2.2 Hydrogen production experiments Experiments were performed in 120 mL serum bottles with a working volume of 40 mL. The basal medium with modified concentration of cellulose and phosphate buffer (KH2PO4 + K2HPO4) was used during trials. Sterile conditions were ensured by autoclaving at 121 °C for 15 min. Bottles were capped with the butyl rubber stoppers and inoculated with the pre-grown enriched bacterial culture (10% v/v). The headspace of the bottles was flushed with argon for 15 min before and after the inoculation to create anaerobic conditions. Initial pH was set to 6.5 ± 0.1. Bioreactors were incubated in a water-batch shaker at 120 RPM for 14 days. Gas and liquid samples were taken for analysis of gas composition, substrates degradation and VFAs formation."
4,Experimental design,"2.3 Experimental design Box-Behnken design (a three-level fractional factorial design) was employed for optimization of the process parameters. The cellulose concentration (C) (2.7–13.5 g/L), phosphate buffer concentration (B) (20–100 mM) and temperature (T) (29–39 °C) were chosen as three independent variables, while CHP and SCE were chosen as the response variables. The range of variables were based on preliminary research (not shown). Experimental design is shown in Table 1 . A total of fifteen experimental trials (each in triplicate) were conducted. Therefore, the results present the mean and standard deviations of three biological replicates. A quadratic polynomial model was fitted to obtained data to evaluate the optimization of the variables of the process: Y = β o + ∑ i = 1 3 β i x i + ∑ i = 1 3 β i i x i 2 + ∑ i = 1 3 ∑ j = 1 3 β i j x i x j where Y is the predicted response; xi are the input variables; βo is the constant coefficient (intercept); βi, βii and βij are the model coefficients for linear, quadratic and interaction effects, respectively. The obtained models were subjected to the stepwise process of model reduction, while maintaining hierarchy of terms. Ultimately, CHP and SCE were optimized simultaneously with RSM integrated with desirability function approach. The responses were transformed into an individual desirability functions that ranges from 0 to 1 (Eq. S1). Then, the overall desirability, which is the geometric mean of individual desirability functions, was maximized (Eq. S2) (Gadhe et al., 2014). Statistical analysis was performed with Statistica software (version 13.3, Statsoft)."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The samples of biogas were taken with a gas-tight syringe. Its composition was measured by gas chromatographic method (Varian CP-3800 with CPCarboPLOT P7 column, TCD detector). Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 8.5 mL/min and the temperature of injection port, oven and the detector were 115, 85 and 110 °C, respectively. The concentration of VFAs and alcohols was determined by HPLC technique (Dionex Ultimate 3000, ThermoScientific, SHODEX sugar column SH 1011, RI detector, 1 mL/min flow - eluent 5 mM H2SO4). Cellulose concentration was analyzed according to method presented by Sluiter et al. (2008)."
6,Calculations,"2.5 Calculations The CHP was calculated using the following equation: V H i = V H i - 1 + ( V i - V i - 1 ) / W V i where: VH,i and VH,i-1 = CHP [L/Lmedium] at current (i) and previous (i-1) time interval; Vi and Vi-1 = cumulative hydrogen volume [L] at current (i) and previous (i-1) time interval; WVi = working volume of bioreactor [L] at current (i) time interval. Pearson correlation coefficient (rp) was calculated to determine the relationships between the process parameters. H2 yield was calculated as the ratio of moles of produced H2 to moles of initial cellulose (expressed as moles of hexose). SCE was calculated as follows: S C E = ( c e l l u l o s e c o n s u m e d / i n i t i a l c e l l u l o s e ) × 100 %"
7,"DNA extraction, sequencing and microbial population analysis","2.6 DNA extraction, sequencing and microbial population analysis Inoculum and biomass samples were collected by centrifugation and the obtained pellets were stored at −20 °C until processing. Total metagenomic DNA of every sample was extracted using GeneMATRIX Soil DNA Purification Kit (Eurx®, Poland) according to manufacturer's protocol and obtained DNA samples were submitted to GENOMED (Warsaw, Poland). Amplification of V3 and V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was performed with primers:341F (5′- TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 785R (5′-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC) using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2x Master Mix, according to manufacturer's recommendations. Obtained amplicons were further processed according to 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation Protocol (Illumina, Part # 15044223, Rev. B) and sequenced using Illumina Miseq instrument (300 bp paired-end sequencing, Illumina Miseq v3 Reagent kit). Samples demultiplexing and raw fastq files were generated using MiSeq Reporter (MSR) v2.6. Bioinformatics was performed using QIIME software (Caporaso et al., 2010). Resulting paired reads were trimmed and filtered using cutadapt according to Martin (2011). Paired reads were joined using fastq-join algorithm. Unique sequences were clustered to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% identity using UCLUST algorithms and chimeric sequences were removed using USEARCH61 algorithm (Edgar, 2010). Taxonomy was assigned to SILVA_v_138 database (Quast et al., 2013). Raw sequences were submitted to EBI with accession number EBI: ERP126944."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Seed sludge enrichment,"3.1 Seed sludge enrichment The essential purpose of this study was enrichment of mixed bacterial culture with bacteria capable of cellulose degradation and simultaneous hydrogen production. H2 formation by bacteria started five days after heat pretreatment and inoculation on medium with cellulose (Fig. 1 ). However, CHP after 18 days reached only 0.48 L H2/Lmedium. Therefore, bacterial culture from bioreactor was transferred to the fresh media (10% v/v) and the process was repeated (Fig. 1). Hydrogen was produced at a faster rate during second cycle and its amount reached 0.94 L H2/Lmedium. It took five cycles of cultivation to stabilize hydrogen production at 1.29 ± 0.04 L H2/Lmedium. The results suggested a gradual enrichment of the bacterial culture with the desired microorganisms. The initial anaerobic sludge microbial composition changed significantly after heat pretreatment and subsequent enrichment during repeated batch cycles with cellulose as a substrate. Microbial analysis revealed that initial anaerobic sludge community contained a number of bacterial classes, including Bacteroidia, Anaerolineae, Synergistia, Clostridia and Activobacteria (21, 16, 13, 9.9 and 5% of reads mapped to corresponding OTUs, respectively). Generally, microorganisms belonging to 16 different classes with a relative abundance above 1% were found in the initial bacterial culture, while the enriched culture contained almost exclusively Clostridia class – 99.9% (Fig. S3). Anaerobic sludge was heat treated before enrichment and Clostridia are commonly associated with the capability to produce heat-resistant endospores (Łukajtis et al., 2018). As a result bacteria culture was dominated with this class of bacteria. This enriched culture had stable H2 production in the subsequent cycles and was used as inoculum for the fermentation experiments."
10,Hydrogen production,"3.2 Hydrogen production Optimizing the production of hydrogen from cellulose with a mixed bacterial culture can reveal complex relationships in this system. Three important factors were evaluated: cellulose concentration, phosphate buffer concentration and temperature. Hydrogen production from cellulose was observed under all experimental conditions. H2 and CO2 were the only gaseous products detected during experiments. No methane was detected in any experiment, because of the inhibition of methanogens by heat treatment of anaerobic sludge. H2 content in the biogas varied between 38 and 64%. CHP varied from 0.78 to 1.97 L H2/Lmedium (Table 1). Statistical model for CHP was developed by applying multiple regression analysis on the experimental data. ANOVA indicated that the model is statistically significant (p < 0.0001) with a high F-value of 76.39 (Table 2 ) and the lack of fit p-value = 0.058. The R2 coefficient of 0.944 suggested that the model could explain 94.4% variability of the response variables. R2 predicted and R2 adjusted parameters were high (above 0.9) and in close agreement with each other, which demonstrated that the obtained model is an accurate representation of the experimental results. Application of RSM resulted in an empirical relationship between CHP and process parameters. The limitation of RSM is that the developed model is valid only for studied ranges of factors. The significance of each term in the model was evaluated by p-value. The model term is considered as significant if the p-value is less than 0.05. ANOVA revealed that only the interaction between cellulose concentration and temperature (CT) was insignificant (p = 0.83) and therefore this term was removed from the model. The obtained coefficients of the regression equation are presented in Table 2. The coded coefficients are useful for identifying the relative impact of the factors on CHP. Cellulose and phosphate buffer concentration had strong effect on the response, while the impact of temperature was slightly lower. Moreover, cellulose and buffer concentration had a significant interactive effect on CHP. This can be explained by the fact that higher substrate concentrations resulted in higher VFAs production, but the resulting pH drop was mitigated by the higher buffer concentration. This allowed to maintain more beneficial pH conditions for hydrogen production, because the highest H2 productivity during dark fermentation is reported for pH between 5.5 and 7.0 (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017). According to the model, maximum CHP that could be obtained at buffer concentration of 20 mM is only 1.11 L H2/Lmedium (Fig. 2 A). This value is in line with 1.07 L H2/Lmedium obtained during trial 2 with 13.5 gcellulose/L and 20 mM buffer concentration. The contour plots (Fig. 2) show that increasing concentration of cellulose and buffer led to higher CHP values. Phosphate buffer concentration and temperature had a clear maximum within the design boundaries (Fig. 2C). Regression analysis of the model revealed that the highest CHP of 2.14 L H2/Lmedium could be obtained at 13.5 gcellulose/L, 79.5 mM buffer and 32.6 °C. Thus, optimum point was located at the boundary of the design space for cellulose concentration (Fig. 2A and B) and it can be assumed that higher concentration of cellulose would led to higher CHP. However, at optimum conditions hydrogen yield of only 0.58 mol H2/molhexose was predicted. Theoretical maximum H2 yield during dark fermentation is 4 mol H2/molhexose, but according to literature yields below 3 mol H2/molhexose are obtained from different substrates (Elsharnouby et al., 2013; Łukajtis et al., 2018). A decrease in H2 yield with an increase in substrate concentration is often reported for biological hydrogen production (Hitit et al., 2017). Indeed, as shown in Table 1, high cellulose concentrations corresponded to low H2 yields. This is the result of incomplete consumption of the substrate. At 13.5 gcellulose/L only 55% cellulose could be consumed. Application of higher concentration of the substrate would result in even higher percentage of unprocessed cellulose. This would not be beneficial for the process. A practical process of biohydrogen production would require high substrate utilization to reduce the amount of process residues Therefore, cellulose consumption (SCE) was another important effect that required optimization."
11,Substrate utilization,"3.3 Substrate utilization SCE between 28 and 100% were obtained during the trials (Table 1). Multiple regression analysis allowed to define the relationship between SCE and the three response parameters – temperature, cellulose concentration and buffer concentration (Table 2). The determination coefficient (R2), R2 predicted and R2 adjusted were high and in good agreement with each other, indicating that the regression model can adequately explain relationship between variables and SCE (0.942, 0.933, 0.908, respectively). ANOVA showed that the model is statistically significant (F-value = 103, p-value < 0.0001). Low p-value of the lack of fit (0.002) could be explained by a very small variability of the center points (trial 13, 14, 15 – Table 1). The interactive term for cellulose and temperature (CT) as well as quadratic effects for buffer concentration (B2) and temperature (T2) were found insignificant and therefore these terms were removed from the model. Linear term of temperature (T) was also insignificant, but it was kept in the model to maintain its hierarchy. It is evident from ANOVA that cellulose concentration had the highest impact on SCE. Analysis of coded coefficients (Table 2) and contour plots (Fig. 3 B) revealed that SCE was decreasing rapidly at higher cellulose concentrations. In other words, increasing cellulose concentration led to higher CHP, but at the cost of decreasing amount of consumed substrate. Moreover, higher buffer concentration had a positive effect on cellulose consumption within the design space (up to 100 mM – Fig. 3A). It could be attributed to its ability of maintaining more stable pH value inside the bioreactors and thus more favorable conditions for microorganisms. On the other hand, as mentioned in section 3.2, buffer concentration had a clear optimum for CHP (79.5 mM). Therefore, buffer concentrations above 80 mM promoted the hydrolysis of cellulose but inhibited H2 production. Surprisingly, temperature had virtually no impact on SCE within the tested range (Fig. 3B and C), although as mentioned above, it had an impact on CHP. This indicates that enriched cellulose degrading bacteria could effectively decompose the substrate over a wide temperature range. The model predicted that 100% SCE is obtained at cellulose concentrations below 3 g/L, while buffer concentration should be at least 60 mM (Fig. 3). At these conditions, H2 yields above 2.5 mol H2/molhexose could be obtained, but it would result in low CHP (around 1 L H2/Lmedium)."
12,Optimization of two conflicting responses with desirability function,"3.4 Optimization of two conflicting responses with desirability function As discussed above, increasing cellulose concentration resulted in higher values of CHP, but lower SCE. Therefore, these two conflicting responses were optimized simultaneously with desirability function approach. It should be noted that during multi-objective optimization the obtained optimum depends on chosen objective function (Eq. S1, S2). The overall desirability surface plot had a clear maximum (Fig. 4 ). The best optimized conditions were found to be 3.35 gcellulose/L, 32.9 °C and 69 mM buffer concentration, while the overall desirability reached 0.793. The predicted CHP and SCE at these conditions were 1.39 L H2/Lmedium and 95%, respectively. These conditions were verified experimentally by running three replicates. CHP and SCE reached 1.35 ± 0.05 L H2/Lmedium and 93.8 ± 1.8% respectively. Thus, the results of the confirmation trials are in close agreement with the predicted values. H2 yield obtained during verification experiments reached 2.71 ± 0.10 mol H2/molhexose. This value is higher than most yields reported in the literature for complex as well as simple sugars (Hassan et al., 2020). Ren et al. (2010) obtained the yield of 2.09 mol H2/molhexose during dark-fermentative H2 production from microcrystalline cellulose (10 g/L) at 40 mM phosphate buffer concentration with inoculum originating from cow dung compost. In another study, 0.53 mol H2/molhexose was obtained with Clostridium sartagoforme FZ11 with 100 mM buffer and microcrystalline cellulose (10 g/L) as a substrate (Zhang et al., 2015). The temperature which was found optimal for simultaneous optimization of CHP and SCE (32.9 °C) was very close to the optimum temperature for CHP (32.6 °C), because as mentioned above temperature had no effect on SCE. Optimum temperature reported in the literature for H2 production at mesophilic conditions vary from 29 °C to even 45 °C – it is usually between 35 and 37 °C (Łukajtis et al., 2018; Wang and Yin, 2018). Thus, the value reported in our study slightly lower than typical optimum. Phosphate buffer concentration of 69 mM was found optimum during multi-response optimization. Higher concentrations of phosphate buffer had negative effect, possibly due to increase of the osmotic pressure. Sreela-or et al. (2011) studying food waste as a substrate and seed sludge as inoculum reported that 44 mM phosphate buffer resulted in maximum H2 yield of 103 mL H2/g-VSadded. On the other hand, the highest hydrogen yield (2.26 mol H2/molhexose) from glucose by Bacillus sp. FS2011 was obtained at 20 mM phosphate buffer (Song et al., 2013). Comparison of literature data with our results indicate that optimum buffer concentration depends strongly on substrate and inoculum used. It was used in this study to alleviate the drop in pH caused by VFAs accumulation. However, utilization of high concentrations of phosphate buffer may have implications for H2 production economy. Commercial process would require cost efficient methods for pH stabilization. Buffer could be replaced by calcium carbonate, because it is a cost-effective neutralizing agent (Salek et al., 2015)."
13,Soluble metabolites composition,"3.5 Soluble metabolites composition Acetate and ethanol followed by butyrate and caproate were the major soluble metabolites detected during the experiments (Table 3 ). Propionate, valerate, heptate and 1-butanol were detected at lower concentrations. No glucose was detected at any stage of fermentation, thus it was instantaneously consumed during cellulose hydrolysis. Acetate and butyrate are usually the main metabolites reported in the literature during dark fermentation (Łukajtis et al., 2018). Fermentation to acetate produce 4 mol H2/molglucose, while butyrate production is accompanied by only 2 mol H2/molglucose. In our study, fermentation at low cellulose concentration led mainly to acetate and lower amounts of ethanol (trial 1, 3, 5, 7). As a result hydrogen yields obtained during these trials were as high as 2.64 mol H2/molhexose (Table 1). Higher cellulose concentrations increased the CHP, but decreased H2 yield, because microorganisms redirected their metabolism to other metabolic pathways – butyrate, ethanol and caproate became more abundant. Their production consumed some of the reducing equivalents, which are required for H2 production. Pearson's analysis confirmed significant positive correlation between CHP and acetic and butyric acid production (rp = 0.73 and rp = 0.82 respectively). Soluble product distribution is heavily dependent on pH conditions during fermentation. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that Standard Gibb's free energy (ΔG°)’ of acetate formation from acetyl-CoA is −4.48 kJ/e– at pH 7, while −2.34 kJ/e– at pH 4 (Lee et al., 2008). Therefore, acetate formation is more preferred near neutral pH. On the other hand, NADH-consuming reactions, such as butyrate and ethanol production, are more favorable at acidic pH. It explains the observation that butyrate was produced after acetate at the later stages of the process (Fig. S2). Medium acidification by acetate induced this metabolic pathway shift. The majority of prior research showed that the transition from the acidogenesis to the solventogenesis (ethanol) is triggered by the reduction of fermentative pH (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017). Indeed, (ΔG°)’ of ethanol formation is decreasing as the pH decreases. However, in our study ethanol accumulation was observed in the trials with the highest final pH. Thus, ethanol formation was controlled not only by thermodynamics. Interestingly, Pearson's analysis showed significant positive correlation between ethanol production and buffer concentration (rp = 0.79). Ethanol concentration reached 2.23 g/L during trial 12 with 100 mM buffer. High phosphate concentration induced redirection of bacterial metabolism to ethanol production (Table 3 – trial 4, 10, 12). This could be the reason of decrease of CHP at buffer concentrations above 80 mM. It should be noted that, the studied range of temperature had a little effect on the distribution of soluble metabolites. Comparison of trials, which had the same conditions except temperature (6 with 8 or 9 with 11), indicated a very similar final concentrations of VFAs and ethanol (Table 3). Pearson's analysis confirmed that temperature had no significant correlation with any soluble microbial product. Cellulose remained in many bioreactors after fermentation, resulting in a low SCE (Table 1). High concentration of VFAs formed during dark fermentation can inhibit metabolic activity of microorganisms and reduce substrate utilization. However, their concentrations above 3 g/L are usually required to observe inhibition effect, while much higher concentrations stops the process completely (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017). Lo et al. reported high hydrogen production yields of 1.5 mol H2/molhexose during fermentation of sucrose (18 g/L) with Clostridium butyricum and Clostridum pasteurianum. Substrate was nearly completely utilized, while the concentrations of VFAs were above 8 g/L (Lo et al., 2008). Therefore, high VFAs concentration were not the reason of low SCE in our study, because here total VFAs concentrations were usually below 3 g/L (Table 3). For example, during trial 11 total VFAs were only 1.87 g/L, but 68% of cellulose was still remaining in the reaction medium. VFAs formed from substrate during dark fermentative hydrogen production led to acidification of the medium. It should be noted that pH dropped from the initial value of 6.5 to around 4.8–5.3 in most of the trails. The complete cellulose conversion (SCE 100%) was observed during trials with 2.7 g/L cellulose (trial 3, 5 and 7), when the final pH was 5.98, 5.41 and 5.51, respectively. In most of the trials the decrease of pH, caused by VFAs production, stopped at a value of about 5.0, although substrate was still present in the bioreactors. It resulted in low SCE (Table 1). In contrast, high substrate consumption with the resulting drop of pH to value as low as 4.0 were observed in many literature reports in batch experiments with simple sugars (Lay et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2008; Song et al., 2013), which indicate that bacteria could still produce hydrogen at such low pH. Moreover, hydrogen production with high glucose consumption and the yield of 1.5 mol H2/molhexose was reported during continuous operation with mixed culture at pH 4.0 (Fang and Liu, 2002). As mentioned above, the lowest pH observed in our study was 4.8. Therefore, hydrogen production was not inhibited by low pH conditions. Thus, it could be assumed that pH decrease to about 5.0 during the fermentation inhibited cellulose hydrolysis. Glucose was not released, which resulted in cessation of H2 production and low SCE values. This study shows that cellulose could not be longer hydrolyzed by bacteria at pH lower than 4.80. Interestingly, increased caproic acid production was observed during trials with 20 mM buffer concentration or at 60 mM buffer with higher cellulose concentration (Table 3 – trial 1, 2, 6, 9). Indeed, caproate formation had significant negative correlation with buffer concentration (rp = −0.67). Caproate is usually produced during reverse β-oxidation. It is a secondary fermentation process, which requires acetate and reduced compounds, such as ethanol or lactate (Greses et al., 2021). Thus, initial fermentation of glucose released from cellulose provided substrates for subsequent caproate production. During this process acetic and butyric acid, which were responsible for pH decrease, were consumed and their chain was elongated to six carbons (caproate). Therefore, simultaneous production of H2 and caproate is an attractive strategy, because it could alleviate pH drop caused by production of short chain fatty acids. The idea behind this approach is similar to combining dark and photo-fermentation in a single bioreactor (Hitit et al., 2017)."
14,Microbial analysis,"3.6 Microbial analysis The analysis of the anaerobic microbiome was performed based on samples from six selected trials, and one sample each from initial anaerobic sludge and culture enriched on cellulose (inoculum). The samples of biomass were taken on 9th day of the trials. A total of 550373 sequences were obtained after adapter trimming and joining paired reads (59690–80201 reads per sample). A decrease in the complexity of the bacterial culture was observed after enrichment of the anaerobic sludge. The richness decreased from 494 OTUs in the initial anaerobic sludge to 171 OTUs in the enriched inoculum. Number of OTUs during trials varied between 134 and 191. Microbial communities during trials had a similar composition of genera to the initial inoculum; however, their relative abundance varied greatly depending on the process conditions (Fig. 5 ). Only seven genera had relative abundance over 1% in at least one sample from trials. Significant number of reads were mapped to OTUs corresponding to Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Paraclostridium, Caproiciproducens, Ruminiclostridium and Lachnoclostridium. The presence of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 was often detected in the previous dark-fermentative studies, especially with glucose as a substrate. In fact, Clostridium cluster I is the largest clostridial cluster with many hydrogen producing species (Park et al., 2014; Romano et al., 2014). In our study most of the species form this cluster were identified as Clostridium chromiireducens (99% similarity) and Clostridium butyricum (100% similarity). Their relative abundance during trials was 1.2%–33.2% and 0.5–12.9% for C. chromiireducens and C. butyricum, respectively. C. chromiireducens was abundant in the recent study on H2 production with glucose as a substrate and heat-treated seed sludge as an inoculum (Kim et al., 2020). C. butyricum is also a well-studied hydrogen producing species, exhibiting high yields of hydrogen from simple sugars (Kanchanasuta et al., 2017). Phylotype annotated as Clostridium tertium was also detected during trials. It was reported in the previous studies as a hydrogen consumer (Park et al., 2014). However, its relative abundance did not exceeded 7.9%. As shown in Fig. S1 hydrogen amount was stable after reaching its maximum, so there were no H2 consuming activity during trials. The relative abundance of reads mapping to OTUs corresponding to Ruminiclostridium papyrosolvens (99.75% similarity) varied greatly between different trials (from 0.5% to 51.5%). This microorganism produce cellulosomes, which are involved in cellulosic biomass degradation (Ren et al., 2019). It was detected as a dominant species during simultaneous hydrogen and ethanol production from napiergrass (Ho et al., 2011). Therefore, it could be assumed that it was responsible for cellulose hydrolysis during fermentations in our study. The relative abundance of R. papyrosolvens was higher in trials with higher buffer concentrations (Fig. 5). It confirmed that pH stabilization at values around 6.0 was required for efficient cellulose hydrolysis. Furthermore, the presence of Paraclostridium bifermentans was observed in all the trials. It is a diverse bacterium often found in the ruminal environment, so it probably has an important role in lignocellulose decomposition. P. bifermentans was identified at high relative abundance (62.7%) in the hydrogen-producing bioreactor with a cellulose as the substrate (Rabelo et al., 2018). Moreover, it was present almost exclusively during H2 production from glucose with the bacterial culture coming from heat-treated lake sediment (Romano et al., 2014). The presence of Lachnoclostridium sp. was observed mainly in trials with high buffer concentration (Fig. 5). In fact, this genus was positively correlated with phosphate concentration (rp = 0.84), ethanol concentration (rp = 0.82) as well as with SCE (rp = 0.87). Lachnoclostridum phytofermentas is the model microorganism that is capable of cellulose hydrolysis with simultaneous production of ethanol as the main by-product (Ren et al., 2007). Therefore, it could be assumed that Lachnoclostridium sp. was responsible for cellulose decomposition and high ethanol concentrations during trials with 100 mM buffer. Interestingly, reads mapped to Caproiciproducens sp. had relative abundance above 60% in trials 2, 8 and 9. Caproiciproducens galactitolivorans was recently isolated from activated sludge and was capable of production of caproic acid from acetate and ethanol (Kim et al., 2015). Pearson's analysis showed that relative abundance of Caproiciproducens sp. in our study was negatively correlated with buffer concentration (rp = 0.90), but positively with caproic acid concentration (rp = 0.98). Lower phosphate concentration (20 mM) and thus lower pH (<5.0) was more beneficial for Caproiciproducens sp. growth and caproate production. This finding contradicts the optimum pH reported by Kim et al. (2015) for Caproiciproducens galactitolivorans, which were 6.5. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study indicating such a high abundance of Caproiciproducens sp. in a hydrogen producing consortium. Caproate is an attractive medium chain fatty acid due to its broad industrial and agricultural applications (Greses et al., 2021). Therefore, co-culturing hydrogen and caproate producing microorganisms would be a desirable strategy to obtain two valuable products in one bioreactor. One of the most promising future prospects would be obtaining stable microbial consortium systems for degradation of lignocellulose biomass with simultaneous hydrogen production. Utilization of mixed bacterial culture for H2 production by consolidated bioprocessing approach would led to minimization of the overall process step. Such consortia would produce lignin and cellulose degrading enzymes and have synergistic metabolic activities to degrade complex substrate. In this respect, ruminant microflora is of great interest for obtaining effective hydrolytic bacteria. Such strains could be also improved by genetic engineering for establishing successful consolidated bioprocessing process (Zabed et al., 2019)."
15,Conclusions,"Mixed bacterial culture was successfully enriched on cellulose with H2 producing microorganisms from the Clostridia class. Pearson analysis showed that there was no significant correlation between CHP and relative abundance of any microorganism, which indicated that various microorganisms contributed to H2 production at the same time. Experimental results demonstrated that cellulose and phosphate buffer concentration had a significant influence on CHP, SCE and the microbial community structure. Optimized conditions obtained with desirability function approach (3.35 gcellulose/L, 32.9 °C and 69 mM buffer concentration) were verified experimentally, which resulted in the H2 yield of 2.71 mol H2/molhexose. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the highest H2 yield reported in the literature for direct cellulose fermentation. The results presents the possibilities of applying raw cellulosic substrate for efficient hydrogen production process."
