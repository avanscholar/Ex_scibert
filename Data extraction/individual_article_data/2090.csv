0,Introduction,"A promising technique of hydrogen production from solar energy by use of semiconductor photocatalysis has attracted much attention since its discovery by Honda-Fujishima [1]. TiO2 has been extensively used as an efficient photocatalyst for water splitting because of its high photoactivity and chemical inertness [2,3]. However, the low charge-separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and poor visible-light absorption still severely constrain their further development especially toward commercial production [4–6]. In view of these scientific problems, research found that the construction of heterostructures is an effective method to reduce the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs [7–9]. Therefore, a large number of Z-scheme heterojunction photosynthetic systems such as CdS-WO3, TiO2-Si, TiO2-C3N4 and ZnO-C3N4 have been investigated and used for photocatalytic reactions [10–13]. Previous research and our work found that the CB of WO3 is between the CB and VB of TiO2, and the VB of WO3 is lower than the VB of TiO2, thus coupling WO3 with TiO2 can form an artificial Z-scheme photocatalytic system, which can promote the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs by transferred electrons of WO3 to the VB of TiO2 [14]. On the other hand, how to further enhance the separation rates of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and improve the quantum yield is another challenge to improve the photocatalytic activities. It has been demonstrated successfully by different groups including ours that the construction of heterojunctions of metal nanoparticles (e.g. Au, Ag and Pt) and TiO2 is a good method [15–17]. Among these metals, Au is a popular choice because of its high chemical stability and its ability to generate surface plasmons at the desired wavelength [18–21]. However, many researchers focus on designing novel material in which insulating layer was introduced to blocking the electron transfer between metal and semiconductor rather than research the coexistence of Schottky and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) effects [22]. So it’s of great significance to construct the Z-scheme heterojunction system with Au nanoparticle, and investigative the impact of the coexistence of the Schottky and SPR effects with the Z-scheme heterojunction for the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. In this paper, we provided an effective route to synthesize ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers by a facile electrospinning technique and subsequent annealing in air. The amount of Au nanoparticles can be regulated by varying the dosage of chloroauric acid in the precursor solution. The investigation of photocatalytic ability indicated that the as-prepared samples exhibited enhanced photocatalytic H2 production rates under sun-light irradiation, the enhanced activities were mainly attributed to the Schottky effect and Z-scheme photosynthetic heterojunction system, WO3 as a hole collector and Au as an electron collector, promoting effective charge separation. More importantly, SPR effect of Au further promoted charge separation and absorption of visible light. On the basis of the Z-scheme heterojunction system, the synergistic effect of Schottky and SPR effect further improve the performance of photocatalytic H2 production. Besides, the electrospun three-dimensional nanofibrous networks can be well recycled for the photocatalyst system [23,24]."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of the ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers,"2.1 Preparation of the ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers The ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning technique. Typically, 2g tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) (Aladdin, CP, 98.0%), 0.15g ammonium tungstate (Aldrich, 99.95%) (Our previous study showed a higher photocatalytic activity in this proportion), different amount of HAuCl4 absolute alcohol solution were dissolved in a mixture containing 10ml ethanol (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, 99.7%) and 6ml acetic acid (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, 99.5%), after magnetic stirring for 20min, 1.1g Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone (PVP, Mw=1,300,000) were added into the solution slowly under vigorous stirring, the resulting solution was magnetic stirred for 12h at room temperature. The mass concentration of HAuCl4 ranged from 0.3% (S2) to 0.45% (S3). Subsequently, the above precursor solutions were drawn into a hypodermic syringe. The positive terminal of a variable high voltage power supply was connected to the needle tip of the syringe while the other terminal was connected to the collector. The distance between the needle tip and collector was ∼15cm, and the voltage was set at 15kV. The as-collected nanofibers were calcined at 520°C for 30min to form ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers. We also use the same method prepare TiO2 (S0) nanofibers and TiO2/WO3 nanofibers (S1) as a contrast."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The morphology of the as-prepared nanofibers was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-7500F) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20). The crystallization and the phase transition were studied by XRD (Rigaku Ultima IV) with Cu Kα radiation (wavelength=0.15406nm) from 20° to 80°, at a scanning rate of 4°/min. The diffuse reflectance spectra of all samples were recorded on a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, model UV 3600) equipped with an integrating sphere in the range of 300–800nm and standard BaSO4 powder was used as a reference. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Photoelectron Spectrometer (UPS) were measured by the multifunctional X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AXIS UltraDLD, Kratos Analytical Inc)."
4,Photoelectrochemical experiment,"2.3 Photoelectrochemical experiment Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a quartz cubic urn with a conventional three-electrode process on an electrochemical workstation (AMETEK, PARSTAT 4000, America). The as-synthetic photoanode was the working electrode, and a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl electrode served as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was a 0.2M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The photoanode surface has an illuminated area of 1.5×1.5cm2. All the samples (0.1g) mixing with polyethylene glycol (0.05g) and water (0.35ml) were deposited on the FTO conducting glass, with thin transparent cover glass to seal avoiding samples fall off. The light source was a 300W Xe lamp (Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd, PLS-SXE-300). The photocurrent response spectroscopy was carried out at a constant potential of +0.9V to the working photoanode. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured at an open-circuit voltage. A sinusoidal ac perturbation of 5mV was applied to the electrode over the frequency range of 100mHz to 10kHz. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the samples was tested using a power source (Newport 300 W Xenon lamp, 66920) with a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 260) and a multimater (Keithley 2001). In our work, the IPCE spectrum was conducted as a function of wavelength from 350 to 800nm by using the as-synthetic photoanode as working electrode and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. All measurements were carried out at room temperature."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen production evaluation,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production evaluation Photocatalytic hydrogen production was proceed on an equipment of online analysis system (LabSolar-III AG, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd.) directly connected with gas chromatography (GC-7860). A 300W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd) was used as the light source, the light intensity of UV, Vis and UV+vis is 2.2mW/cm2, 9.6mW/cm2 and 10.1mW/cm2. 0.05g as-prepared sample was mixed with 45ml deionized water and 25ml methyl alcohol (anhydrous, Sinopharm Chemical Regent, 99.5%) under strong magnetic stirring for sufficient mixing. The advantage of online analysis system for hydrogen production is that we could test the amount of H2 by real-time monitoring and the generated gas was pumped to gas chromatography every 1h to get the in situ average hydrogen production rate."
6,Results and discussion,
7,SEM of the as-prepared ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers,"3.1 SEM of the as-prepared ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers The morphologies of the as-prepared ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It could be seen from Fig. 1 A that the 3D web structure composed of uniform and straight nanofibers, and the length of these randomly oriented nanofibers could reach up to several micrometers or more. According to the enlarged image in Fig. 1B, the diameter of those nanofibers ranged from 300 to 350nm. And, the enlarged fiber had a relatively smooth surface without secondary nanostructures. The elements mapping of as-prepared S2 sample in Fig. 1C–F show the distribution of the elements of Ti, O, W and Au, indicating a uniform distribution of the various elements in the sample, besides, the element of Au nanoparticle distributed in the surface and the interior of the nanofibers (Fig. S1)."
8,TEM of the as-prepared ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers,"3.2 TEM of the as-prepared ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers In order to obtain more detailed information about the morphology and crystalline structure of the ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation were carried out. Fig. 2 A showed the typical TEM of the ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers. It can be observed that the composite nanofibers have a smooth surface, which is consistent with the result of the SEM image. A close investigation of S2 sample by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Fig. 2B–F) reveals that Au nanoparticles with a diameter of ∼5nm distributed in the fiber’s interior and surface, this results indicate that Au and TiO2 nanoparticles have a good contract, which lead to the formation of close Schottky contact between Au and TiO2 nanoparticles. Besides, the interplanar spacing of 0.352nm and 0.367nm attribute to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 and the (200) plane of WO3, respectively."
9,X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns,"3.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns The crystallographic structure and phase purity of the as-prepared samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, as shown in Fig. 3 . Five reflection peaks appeared at 2θ=25.3°, 37.7°, 48°, 53.8°, 62.6° are indexed to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (204), respectively. It displayed well-structured diffraction patterns for anatase TiO2 phase (ICSD: 01-070-7348), and it is in very good agreement with previous reports [25]. And the weak peaks at 24.2° and 33.9° can be indexed to the (200) and (220) crystal planes of the anatase phase of WO3 (ICSD: 00-001-0486), the peaks of WO3 are very peak because of its low concentration. Besides, there are no Au peaks in the XRD patterns because of its small size and low concentration."
10,Characterization of the electronic structure of the as-prepared samples,"3.4 Characterization of the electronic structure of the as-prepared samples The photocatalytic efficiency is highly related to the light absorption including amount, wavelength range, and absorption peak position. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is an effective tool for light absorption measurement. Fig. 4 (A) shows the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy of the as-prepared samples. The diffuse reflectance spectrum of TiO2 nanofibers only exhibited the fundamental absorption band in the UV region, there is no more absorption in visible wavelengths, it is assigned to the intrinsic band gap absorption of anatase TiO2 (Eg: ∼3.2eV) [26]. Different from pure TiO2 nanofibers, there was a certain redshift after coupling with WO3，it may be due to the narrow band gap of WO3 and the formation of complex oxide by TiO2 and WO3, which prompting the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. And, all the ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers present an obvious absorption band centered at ∼630nm, which arises from the surface SPR effect of Au Nanoparticles [27]. The SPR position of Au is clearly red-shifted based on the special prepare methods, this similar phenomenon also founded in our previous work [28]. Besides, the Au SPR peak becomes more intensive with the increasing of the amount of Au nanoparticles. We plotted the image of (αhν)2 and (hν) for the purpose of calculating the band gaps, as is shown in Fig. 4B, the Eg value of S0 and S3 are calculated to be 3.46eV and 3.21eV, respectively [29]. In order to further determine the ionization potential [equivalent to the valence band energy (Eν)] of S3 sample, we did the UPS experiment. As is shown in Fig. 4C, the Ev of S3 sample was calculated to be 7.53eV by subtracting the width of the He I UPS spectra from the excitation energy (21.22eV), thus the conduction band energy Ec of 4.32eV can be calculated from Ev-Eg. According to the reference standard for which 0eV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) equals −4.44eV versus evac (vacuum level) [30], the Eg, Ev, and Ec values of S3 sample are converted to electrochemical energy potentials in volts, Fig. 4D showed that the valence band of S3 sample is below the oxidation level for H2O to H2O2 or O2, and the conduction band is above the reduction level for H2, these results revealed the bands are properly for water splitting."
11,XPS spectra,"3.5 XPS spectra In order to determine the existence of the various elements especially Au in the prepared sample and the valence, the chemical composition of the ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. These results were observed in Fig. 5 (A)–(E). The binding energy for C 1s peak at 283.4eV was used as the reference for calibration. The survey spectrum as presented in Fig. 5A confirms that only Ti, W, Au, and O were present in the ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers, which are in consistent with the EDS spectrum. High resolution XPS spectrum of Ti 2p, W 4f, Au 4f, and O 1s were observed in Fig. 5(B)–(E), respectively. The Ti 2p high resolution XPS spectra are analyzed in Fig. 5B. It could be seen from the spectrum that two peaks occurred at 457.6 and 463.3eV were well corresponded with Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 binding energies, respectively. The splitting of the 2p doublet was 5.7eV, indicating a normal state of Ti4+ in the ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers. Fig. 5C depicted the spin–orbit splitting of W 4f and can be deconvoluted into a doublet with binding energy peaks at 34.3eV and 36.2eV, resulting from the emission of W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 that might belong to the W6+ oxidation state of tungsten atoms and this is in good agreement with previously reported results. The Au 4f signals are shown in Fig. 5D, the presented Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f 5/2 peaks are located at 82.4 and 86.1eV, respectively, which well agree with the values of the metallic Au0 state [31]. Fig. 5E shows the O 1s signal was well fitted with three contributions. The peak at binding energy of 528.4eV was attributed to the O in TiO2 and WO3, the peak at 528.9 and 529.3eV should be ascribed to surface hydroxyl groups, and adsorbed O2 species, respectively. All of these XPS results and other characterizations gave the insight that the ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers were composed of TiO2, WO3 and Au. Table S1 in the supporting information showed the experimental details and element contents of Au determined by XPS. We can determine the proportion of Au in the surface and in the internal in the fibers by the amount of Au added in the precursor solution, and better research the effect of Au in different position. Besides, the result showed that the content of Au increased with the addition of chloroauric acid, which is consistent with the theoretical results."
12,Photoelectrochemical test,"3.6 Photoelectrochemical test The photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared samples were estimated by detecting the photocurrents generated. Photocurrents which were measured with 0.2M Na2SO4 solution as electrolyte gives an apparent response to light on/off for TiO2 nanofibers, TiO2/WO3 nanofibers and the ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers electrodes under the irradiation of UV+vis light, as shown in Fig. 6 A. It was clear that fast and uniform photocurrent responses were observed in both electrodes and the photoresponsive phenomenon was entirely reversible. Under the irradiation of UV+vis light, the order of photocurrent is: S0<S1<S2<S3, indicating that our design idea is feasible. Such obviously differences between these photoelectrode probably owing to the nice light absorbance, the efficient electron transfer and the change separation in the composites. Such obviously different electrical conductivity between the TiO2 nanofibers, TiO2/WO3 nanofibers and the ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers can be confirmed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 6B displayed the EIS of those four electrodes. All the Nyquist plots impedance spectra were in open-circuit potential conditions and showed similar. The nonlinear regression fitting using a conventional Randle’s circuit (R (QR)) routine [32] gave active charge transfer resistance for: S3<S2<S1<S0, which indicated that the structure of the ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers could reduce the mass-transfer resistance and enhance the electrolyte penetration as well as ion diffusion in the host material because of the introduction of Au excellent electron-transporting and electron-accepting properties. Since a lower charge transfer resistance was indicative of recombination suppression by improved charge transport to the electrolyte, these results suggested that both WO3 and Au played important roles in improving the charge separation efficiency. What’s more, in order to further investigative the photoelectrochemical properties of as-prepared samples, we conducted IPCE testing of S0, S1, and S3 samples, as is shown in Fig. 7 . And quantified its values at particular wavelength, shown in Table S2. From Fig. 7 and Table 1 , we can see that the IPCE enhancement factor of S0, S1 and S3 sample in UV is 5.45, 5.69 and 6.59, compared to S0 sample, the IPCE values of S1 and S3 sample at 360nm were increased 4.4% and 20.9% respectively. The IPCE enhancement factor of S0, S1 and S3 sample at 420nm is 0.32, 0.41 and 0.92, indicating that there is a certain red shift after complexed with WO3 and Au. What’s more, the IPCE enhancement factor of S0, S1 and S3 sample at 630nm is 0.045, 0.1 and 0.56, respectively. These results showed that the higher IPCE values of S3 sample electrode were increased in not only UV region but also visible region, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of SPR and Schottky effect of Au, and this is consistent with the results of the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra."
13,Photocatalytic hydrogen production activity,"3.7 Photocatalytic hydrogen production activity In order to determine the photocatalytic activity of these as-prepared samples, we utilized them for photocatalytic hydrogen production [33–35]. Photocatalytic hydrogen production of as-prepared samples was evaluated under 300W Xenon lamp irradiation using methanol as a scavenger. As is shown in Fig. 8 A, H2 production of pure TiO2 is almost undetectable, after being coupled with WO3, H2 production rate is increasing, reached 26.12μmol/h. Notably, H2 production of the ternary TiO2/WO3/Au composite nanofibers is significantly improved compared with TiO2 nanofibers and TiO2/WO3 nanofibers. And when the content of Au is within a certain range, H2-production is higher when the content of Au is getting higher, H2 production rate of S2 and S3 is 182.93 and 269.63μmol/h respectively. As shown in Fig. 8(B, C), under the irradiation of UV+vis and UV light respectively, no obviously loss of photocatalytic performance was observed for S3 being used for 4 cycles. It was indicated that the TiO2/WO3/Au composite nanofibers displayed an efficient photoactivity and could be easily recycled. Fig. 8D shown the difference of H2 production rate of S3 under UV+vis and UV light, compared with the H2 production rate under the irradiation of UV light, the H2 production rate of S3 under the irradiation of UV+vis was increased 62.8%, this enhancement (EM) may be attributed to the SPR effect of Au. In order to better verify the synergistic effect of Schottky and SPR effect of Au, we also tested the photocatalyst hydrogen production activity of S3 sample under Vis light irradiation, as is shown in Fig. S2, the hydrogen production activity of S3 sample is 165.57μmol/h, 75.64μmol/h and 269.63μmol/h under UV, Vis and UV+Vis light irradiation, respectively. The hydrogen production activity of S3 sample under UV+Vis light irradiation is higher than the sum of the hydrogen production activity of S3 sample under UV and Vis light irradiation. Which may be attributed to the synergistic effect of SPR and Schottky effect of Au. We have revised and made a mark in the manuscript. Moreover, in order to better illustrate the synergies of SPR and Schottky effect of Au, we prepared S3 sample without the addition of WO3, and studied its photocatalytic performance, the hydrogen production rate is shown in Fig. 9 . From the figure we can see that the hydrogen production rate of Au/TiO2 nanofibers under UV, Vis and UV+vis is 102.44μmol/h, 5.68μmol/h and 173.81μmol/h, respectively. The hydrogen production rate of Au/TiO2 nanofibers under Vis irradiation is very low and almost undetectable, but the hydrogen production rate under UV+vis irradiation is much higher than the hydrogen production rate under UV irradiation. This also confirms our statement on TiO2/WO3/Au nanofibers that the synergies of SPR and Schottky effect of Au promoting the hydrogen production."
14,Postulated photocatalytic mechanism,"3.8 Postulated photocatalytic mechanism In order to study the reason of the enhanced activities of the as-prepared ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers, an energy level diagram showing the positions of the bands of TiO2, WO3 and Au is presented in Fig. 10 . As shown in Fig. 10a, the CB of WO3 is between the CB and VB of TiO2, and the VB of WO3 is lower than the VB of TiO2, so it can form band bending and artificial Z-scheme when WO3 contact with TiO2. Under the irradiation of UV light, the photogenerated electrons of WO3 transferred to the VB of TiO2, and recombination with the hole of TiO2, promoting an effective charge separation. Besides, the photogenerated electrons of TiO2 transferred from the CB of TiO2 to Au nanoparticles, further promoted the charge separation. In this system, Au as an electron collector and WO3 as a hole collector, thus promoting charge separation. As shown in Fig. 10b, under the irradiation of UV+vis light, the hot plasmonic electrons of Au can be transformed to the CB of TiO2, thus improving H2 production rate. There are two mayor role Au nanoparticles played in this Au/TiO2/WO3 heterojunction photocatalyst system. The first one is to transfer electron from the TiO2 surface to react with H+ in water for hydrogen production. Another positive effect is that photoexcited electrons of gold surface plasmon may be injected into the TiO2 conduction band, creating separated electrons and holes. Therefore, this may not only improve the visible light absorption but also reduce the chance of recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, hence increasing the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. In summary, we have successfully realized multichannel improvement of charge-carrier based on the ternary Z-scheme TiO2/WO3/Au heterostructures composite nanofibers by electrospinning technique. The H2 production rate of the as-prepared composite materials was greatly enhanced comparing with the pure TiO2 nanofibers and TiO2/WO3 nanofibers. The enhanced activities were mainly attributed to the Schottky effect and Z-scheme photosynthetic heterojunction system, WO3 as a hole collector and Au as an electron collector, promoting effective charge separation. More importantly, SPR effect of Au further promoted charge separation and absorption of visible light. On the basis of the Z-scheme photosynthetic heterojunction system, the synergistic effect of Schottky and SPR effect further improve the performance of photocatalytic H2 production. Notably, the free-standing 3D nanotubes network structure could improve photocatalyst’s performance of separation. And, it is expected that the nanofibers network will promote their industrial application as clean energy materials."
