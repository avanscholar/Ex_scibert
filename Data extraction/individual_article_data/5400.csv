0,Introduction,"Higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) from nature gas or coal via syngas was considered to be a promising alternative route for the production of clean fuels and chemicals in view of both utilization of resources and environmental protection [1]. Among various catalysts, alkali-doped molybdenum sulfide (ADM) catalysts have attracted much interest due to their higher selectivity to alcohols, higher activity for water–gas shift reaction and excellent resistance to sulfur poisoning for feed gas [2–5]. Previous studies revealed that for K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst, the addition of F–T element Co could enhance the selectivity to higher alcohol. However, the studies of other F–T elements such as Ni and Fe were fairly rare [6,7]. Nickel was generally considered to be active towards methanation. Recent investigations on group VIII elements including Co, Fe and Ni catalysts revealed that, in some cases, nickel showed an excellent ability for CO insertion, which has an important significance for higher alcohol synthesis [8]. Especially, nickel could keep high activity after sulfur treatment [9]. As a result, Ni-contained catalyst may be a potential for higher alcohol synthesis. In the present paper, modified Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst and the performances of higher alcohol synthesis were investigated."
1,Experimental,"Conventional K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst was prepared by thermal decomposition of mixture of (NH4)2MoS4 and K2CO3 at 500 °C under N2. (NH4)2MoS4 was obtained through the reaction of (NH4)2S and (NH4)2Mo7S24 as described elsewhere [10]. Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst was prepared by co-precipitation of Ni(C2H4O2)4 and (NH4)2MoS4 solutions (Mo:Ni molar ratio=3:1). The precipitates were mixed with K2CO3 (K/Mo molar ratio=0.7) followed by thermal decomposition at 500 °C under N2. The BET surface areas of K2CO3/MoS2 and Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 catalysts were 10.4 m2/g and 9.6 m2/g, respectively. The carbon monoxide hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a stainless fixed-bed reactor with I.D. of 5 mm with a catalyst loading of 1 ml and the reaction conditions were as follows: temperature=280–340 °C, H2/CO=2.0, GHSV=3000 h− 1 and a pressure of 10.0 MPa. Syngas obtained from decomposition of methanol was introduced into the reactor after purification and preheating. The products were analyzed by gas chromatographs: H2, CO, CH4 and CO2 were analyzed by TCD equipped with a TDX01 column; the liquid products were analyzed by FID equipped with a Porapake-Q column. The mass balance was based on carbon-atom and the error of the balance of oxygen and hydrogen was within 5%. The activity of synthesis of alcohols was expressed as space-time yield (STY), gROH/mlcat. h and the alcohol selectivity was based on carbon mole selectivity on a CO2 free basis."
2,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 illustrates the performances of K2CO3/MoS2 and Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 catalysts for higher alcohol synthesis from syngas. It can be seen that the addition of Ni improved the catalytic reactivity clearly. At 320 °C, the CO conversion and the alcohol STY over K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst were 15.17% and 0.18 g/ml h, respectively. But for Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst, the CO conversion and the alcohol STY were 25.15% and 0.3 g/ml h, respectively. The addition of Ni resulted in a higher selectivity to hydrocarbons (from 13.48 C-atom % to 24.10 C-atom %), which increased monotonously with the temperature over the two catalysts (see Fig. 2 ). However, with increasing temperature, the selectivity to hydrocarbons over Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst tended to be close to that of K2CO3/MoS2. For K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst, the maximum space-time yield of alcohols was 0.23 g/ml h at 340 °C, however, the maximum space-time yield of alcohols 0.3 g/ml h was obtained at 320 °C over Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst. Similar to K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst, the major products of alcohols over Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst were C1–C4 linear alcohols. For the catalyst modified by nickel, the percentage of ethanol increased obviously. From Fig. 3 it can be seen that the addition of Ni resulted in an apparent deviation of ethanol yield from the traditional linear Anderson–Schulz–Flory (A–S–F) distribution of K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst, which indicated that Ni exerted a promotion effect on the chain propagation for the step of C1 to C2. The influences of temperature on the distribution of alcohols over Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst are shown in Fig. 4 . It was found that the percentages of methanol and ethanol decreased while propanol and butanol increased as the temperature increased. Higher temperature was favorable in the formation of higher alcohols. Considering that the undesired hydrocarbons were easily formed at higher temperature, the optimum temperature range was 320–340 °C for Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst. A stability test of Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst at 300 °C, 10.0 MPa, 3000 h− 1 was conducted for about 200 h and the results indicated the catalyst showed good stability under reaction conditions (Fig. 5 ). The nature of nickel promoter on the catalytic performance of Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst is under research. According to the mechanisms of carbon chain growth by CO insertion of K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst [6], it seems that the promoting effect for the step of C1 to C2 may be due to the strong ability of CO insertion of Ni promoter to form higher alcohol [8]. On the other hand, nickel also exerts a function to accelerate the dissociation of CO to produce more precursors of CH x , which is favorable to the production of higher alcohols with CO insertion."
3,Conclusions,"For traditional K2CO3/MoS2 higher alcohol synthesis catalyst, nickel was an efficient promoter, which could promote both catalytic activity and selectivity to higher alcohols (especially ethanol). Compared with K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst, the selectivity to hydrocarbons over Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst was close to that of K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst in the temperature range of 320–340 °C, however, the STY of alcohols was much higher. Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst showed good stability during a running of 200 h. As a result, nickel appeared to be a potential promoter for K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst."
