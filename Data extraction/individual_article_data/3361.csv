0,Introduction,"Hydrogen iodide (HI) is commercially available as a 55–57 wt% aqueous solution for use as a synthetic reagent, and is used as an acid, 1 a reducing agent, 2 a nucleophile, 3 and so on. 4 Recently, we explored the utilization of HI gas in reaction with acetophenones to form α-alkylated acetophenones under solvent-free conditions. 5 Related to that reaction mechanism, we were interested in the reactivity of benzyl alcohols toward HI. In this manuscript, we described the reaction of benzyl alcohols with HI gas; three types of reactions, i.e., iodination, reduction, and ring formation, occurred at ambient temperature under solvent-free conditions (Scheme 1 ). The formation of indane rings due to the reaction of styrene derivatives with Brønsted acids has been reported, although oligomerization occurred in some cases as a side reaction. 6 Selective formations of indanes have been achieved with styrene by using Lewis acids, 7 transition metals, 8 and ionic liquids. 9 Benzyl alcohols can produce indanes through dimerization. 10 Stavber and co-workers reported that the reaction of 2-phenyl-2-propanol in the presence of I2 at 70 °C gave indane products under solvent-free conditions. 11 Hence, we also investigated the scope and limitations of indane ring formation under ambient conditions."
1,Results and discussion,"First, we examined the reactivities of primary, secondary, and tertiary benzyl alcohols with HI gas; their substituents were fixed with methyl and phenyl groups (Table 1 ). Unique selectivity was observed. Compounds with less crowding around the benzyl position, such as 1a and 1b gave iodination products 2a and 2b (entries 1–3). The use of more than one equivalent of HI led to the efficient generation of 2a. Even with one equivalent of HI, 2b was obtained in good yield (80%) from secondary alcohol 1b, whose benzyl cation would be stabilized efficiently. When tertiary alcohol 1c was treated with HI gas, a cyclized product, indane 4c, was obtained in 62% yield (entry 4). With secondary alcohol 1d, which contains a second phenyl ring, a complex mixture was obtained. However, we were able to find reduction product 3d, which was produced in 14% yield (entry 5). In the case of tertiary alcohol 1e, a mixture of reduction product 3e and indane 4e was obtained; iodination product 2e was not found (entry 6). When this reaction was conducted with triphenylmethanol (1f), reduction product 3f was obtained (entry 7). The yield of 3f was increased when two equivalents of HI were used (entry 8). The reduction of triphenylmethanol derivatives with aqueous HI has been reported in the literature 12 and required refluxing conditions. When HI gas is used, the reaction can proceed at ambient temperatures. Under those conditions, the formation of ethers as side products is plausible. However, the corresponding ethers could not be found in crude 1H NMR spectra. This may because the products can be formed from the ethers under the reaction conditions. To test this hypothesis, we examined the reaction of the ethers under the same conditions (Scheme 2 ). The results showed that the corresponding products could be obtained from the ethers. The reaction of dibenzyl ether (5a), the ethereal form of 1a, gave iodination product 2a in 91% yield, along with the leaving alcohol (80%). Ether 5b gave iodination product 2b in 50% yield with 13% of the corresponding alcohol. Unfortunately, we could not prepare the corresponding ethers of 1c and 1f. Hence, we attempted to the reactions of their methyl ethers (6a and 6b, respectively). These reactions also produced 4c and 3f. Therefore, the ethers are also possible reaction intermediates. According to those results, the preferred reaction can be predicted based on the stabilization of the intermediate and the crowding at the benzyl position. The proposed reaction mechanism is depicted in Scheme 3 . First, alcohol 1 is protonated by HI to generate an oxonium ion. After elimination of H2O, benzyl cation A is formed. Intermediate A can produce ether B by reacting with 1. However, ether B can generate A under acidic conditions. With less crowded benzyl cations such as those of 1a and 1b, iodide counter ion can attach easily to the cation to give iodination product 2. When an additional substituent is attached to the benzyl cation, there are two possible paths. One path is the formation of reduction product 3. The additional phenyl group at the benzyl position in 1d, 1e, and 1f weakens the CI bond even though the CI bond was formed because of the static interaction. The CI bond (2.285 Å) of triphenylmethyl iodide (CCDC Refcode: TEWWEX) 13 is longer than the typical CI bond distance (2.162 Å). 14 Therefore, iodide can be removed by HI to form a benzyl anion (C). Furthermore, reduction product 3 is obtained via the protonation of C. The formation of 3 in greater than 50% yield in the presence of two equivalents of HI is reasonable (Table 1, entry 8). The formation of reduction product 3 through homolytic cleavage of the CI bond in the iodinated compound is also plausible. However, Kahr and co-workers reported that triphenylmethyl iodide is stable under these conditions (reacted at 25 °C). The other path from cation A is taken when the temperature is below 80 °C. 13 Consequently, the radical path via homolytic cleavage can be excluded from our reaction. When there is a β-hydrogen at the cationic carbon as with 1c and 1e, an elimination reaction occurs to give styrene derivative D. Carbon–carbon bond formation occurs between intermediate D and cation A to give tertiary cation E. Intramolecular nucleophilic attack by the phenyl ring and elimination of HI produce cyclization product 4. We also investigated indane ring formation, which involves selective carbon–carbon bond formation. The results are presented in Table 2 . According to the reaction mechanism in Scheme 3, a catalytic amount of HI is sufficient to advance the reaction. However, the use of one equivalent of HI gave indane 4c efficiently in 62% yield (entries 1–3). It is reasonable that H2O generated as a side product would decrease the acidity of HI. This reaction could be conducted in CHCl3 (entry 4). However, the formation of 4c was inhibited strongly when aqueous HI was used (entry 5). The results suggest that it is important to conduct the reaction under anhydrous conditions. The use of other acids such as HCl and MeSO3H gave unsatisfactory results (entries 6 and 7). Therefore, efficient indane formation requires the HI. The presence of a methyl group, which is an electron-donating substituent, on the phenyl ring increased the yield (entries 8–10). In contrast, lower yields were obtained with compounds with chloro- and trifluoromethyl groups, which are electron-withdrawing substituents (entries 11 and 12), which destabilize benzyl cation intermediate A in Scheme 1. Substrates with naphthyl groups reacted efficiently to give the corresponding indanes (entries 13 and 14). In particular, the 2-naphthyl substrate gave a single isomer 4m in 79% yield (entry 14) although reactions also occurred at the 1 and 3 positions of the naphthalene ring. The use of heteroaromatics gave no indane product and led to either a complex mixture (Ar = 2-thienyl group) or no reaction (Ar = pyridyl group). Substrates with longer alkyl groups gave undesirable results. For example, a complex mixture was obtained in the reaction of 3-phenylpentan-3-ol. Furthermore, an elimination reaction occurred and no indane ring was formed when diisopropylphenylmethanol was treated with HI (Eq. (1)). We also examined the reaction of a styrene with HI because the styrene is formed in the proposed reaction mechanism. When α-methylstyrene was treated with HI gas, corresponding indane 4c was obtained. However, the yield was not as high as that of the reaction with alcohol 1c (Eq. (2)). We were unable to explain the differences between those reactions, but the gradual production of styrene derivatives prevent polymerization. Image 3 In conclusion, three types of reaction occurred between benzyl alcohols and HI. The product selectivity depended on the degree of crowding and the benzylic stabilization. These reactions were conducted under solvent-free conditions at ambient temperature. Furthermore, the indane ring formation, which involves a reaction between two molecules, proceeded efficiently even under solvent-free conditions. (1) (2)"

4,Handling the apparatus for HI collection,"3.2 Handling the apparatus for HI collection [Caution!: HI is corrosive in the case to contact with moisture. The experiment should be conducted into fume hood.] To pick up anhydrous HI, the stainless tube of the apparatus for HI collection was dehydrated by heating with heating gun in vacuo with vacuum pump. The apparatus was filled with argon gas and was made depression. This cycle was repeated in several times. After filled with argon gas, the vacuum pump was exchanged to the line for HI collection. Argon gas was flowed through the apparatus for 10 min (the flow was controlled by the control valve for argon). And the following operation was done at the same time: closing the control valve of argon and opening the valve of HI cylinder. After 5 min to flow HI gas (the flow was controlled by the control valve for HI gas), it was picked up through rubber septum with a syringe attached with disposable needle. The apparatus was worked off as follows. The valve of HI cylinder was closed and the control valve of argon was opened. After continuing argon flow until the neutralization of the evolved gas (checked by pH paper), the valve of argon cylinder was closed. The line for HI collection was exchanged to the vacuum pump, and the apparatus was made depression for 30 min. During the reduced pressure, the stainless tube was heated with heating gun. The vacuum pump was stopped, and the apparatus was filled with argon with an application of pressure (4–5 MPa). The depression and the filling of argon was repeated in three times to completely exclude HI gas."
5,Procedure for the reaction of benzyl alcohols with HI gas,"3.3 Procedure for the reaction of benzyl alcohols with HI gas In a round bottom flask fitted with three-way cock with septum was placed benzyl alcohol analogue (1.0–1.5 mmol). The flask was filled with nitrogen after reducing pressure. After slight decompression to ease to the gas introduction, HI gas (0.5–2.0 equiv.) was brought in the vessel with syringe through the septum (the weight of HI gas was calculated the change of the weight of the equipment before and after the introduction of HI gas). And nitrogen gas was introduced into vessel to release deference of pressure against atmosphere. The mixture stood at 25 °C for 2 d. After reducing pressure to release HI gas, to the reaction mixture was added saturated Na2S2O3 (20 mL) and brine (15 mL). After being extracted with CHCl3 or Et2O (15 mL × 3), the organic layer was dried with MgSO4. After the concentration, ca. 10.0 mg of the residue was combined with p-chlorobenzaldehyde (ca. 10.0 mg) as an internal standard. And the mixture was measured with 1H NMR to determine the yield by the integration of methyl, methylene or methine peak of the product and formyl peak of p-chlorobenzaldehyde (9.98 ppm).
