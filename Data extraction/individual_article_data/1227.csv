0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean fuel and an important feedstock in chemical industry. Despite it can be produced from various sources, the vast majority of hydrogen produced in the US still comes from steam reforming of methane (SRM) [1,2]. Due to the highly endothermic nature of SRM, it usually requires high temperature (700–1000 °C) and pressure (3–25 bar) to achieve desirable methane conversion and production rate. The energy cost prevents hydrogen from being utilized as a major source of fuel. Therefore, studies of improving the energy efficiency of methane conversion to hydrogen, or specifically SRM, has drawn extensive research interests from academia. In a commercial SRM unit, multiple reactions take place as follows: (A) C H 4 + H 2 O ↔ C O + 3 H 2 Δ H = 206 kJ / mol (B) C O + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 Δ H = − 41 kJ / mol (C) C H 4 + 2 H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + 4 H 2 Δ H = 165 kJ / mol Reaction (B) is known as water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. As indicated above, the reaction is mildly exothermic and therefore it is not favored at high temperatures required by methane steam reforming (reaction (A) and (C)). This would render the product stream of an industrial methane reformer with relatively high concentration of CO (~15% wet based). Normally, another WGS reaction unit has to be incorporated into the process to convert the remaining CO to H2. Inorganic membrane technology has great potential to promote the efficiency of the SRM process. By in situ removal of products (H2 or CO2), the reaction equilibrium can be shifted and achieve process intensification. In the past decades, research activities were mainly concentrated on H2-permselective membranes. Gallucci et al. [3] demonstrated a Pd–Ag dense alloy membrane and achieved 22–62% CH4 conversion at 350–450 °C with 122 kPa feed pressure. Besides dense metal membranes, composite membranes with porous support were also developed to reduce the usage of costly palladium. Kikuchi et al. [4] proposed a Pd-alumina composite membrane can achieve 64% CH4 conversion at 400 °C with 100 kPa feed pressure and vacuum at the permeate side. Tong et al. [5] fabricated a thin Pd-based membrane with porous stainless-steel support (Pd/PSS). The demonstration showed high methane conversion of 84–98% at 450–550°C with 300 kPa feed pressure. However, the high material cost and instability of Pd prevent these membranes from being utilized in real industrial processes. Dolan et al. [6] reported susceptibility of Pd-based membranes to CO and other sulfur-containing trace compounds. More recently, in the stability test conducted by Anzelmo et al. [7], H2/Ar selectivity of the Pd/PSS membrane dropped significantly after 250 h of performing steam reforming. Apart from Pd-based membranes, microporous silica-based membranes were also applied to SRM or WGS membrane reactors [8–12]. Although the price of fabricating these membranes are lower, the H2/CO2 selectivity of these are not desirable compared with Pd-based membranes. In addition, the produced H2 is collected at the permeate side with low pressure, which would require extra energy for compression prior to subsequent transport and utilization. Besides H2-permselective membranes, CO2-permselective membranes could also be good alternatives to increase methane conversion or enhance H2 production in SRM. Extensive efforts have been made in developing polymeric [13,14] and molecular-sieving [15–17] membranes with CO2 permeability. However, these membranes do not work at high temperatures required by SRM. Our group and a few others have conducted a series of research on dense ceramic-carbonate dual-phase membranes for CO2 separation [18–27]. Most notably, Dong and Lin [28] successfully demonstrated enhanced WGS reaction by a catalyst-free ceramic-carbonate membrane reactor. In the case of SRM reactor, WGS reaction can be facilitated by in situ CO2 removal and the H2 concentration in the retentate is expected to increase. Moreover, since the produced hydrogen is collected on the retentate side of a CO2-permselective membrane reactor, high pressure H2 stream can be produced when pressurized feed is used. The collected hydrogen can be directly used for power generation or chemical synthesis. Furthermore, pure CO2 permeate collected on the permeate side is convenient for CO2 storage or sequestration. One of the major challenges of ceramic-carbonate membranes is the difficulty of fabricating a thin gas-tight dual-phase membrane (<500 μm). This is because the molten carbonate can infiltrate most types of ceramic support, and the support has to be thick enough to provide adequate mechanical strength. Dong et al. [27] and Lu et al. [28] tackled this problem by introducing bismuth-yttrium-samarium oxide (Bi1.5Y0.3Sm0.2O3-δ, BYS) into the support. The unique carbonate non-wettable property of BYS makes it an excellent support material. In addition, BYS has similar crystal structure to the well-studied samarium-dope ceria (Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ, SDC), which has been researched for gas separation and fuel cell applications [29–31]. The intrinsic material property makes BYS chemically compatible with SDC [32]. Therefore, an asymmetric-structured membrane with a thick BYS-SDC support layer and a thin SDC-carbonate permselective layer can be fabricated. Due to much lower ionic diffusion resistance, the asymmetric membrane exhibits significantly higher CO2 flux than the symmetric-structured thick SDC-carbonate membrane [32]. Despite a number of studies have been conducted on the H2-removal approach to promote the efficiency of SRM, to the best of our knowledge, the CO2-removal approach has not been demonstrated. Inspired by the distinctive performance of BYS-SDC asymmetric thin dual-phase membrane, we decided to implement this concept of membrane reactor to perform SRM. With its in situ CO2 removal capability, WGS reaction can be enhanced and H2 concentration in the retentate is expected to increase significantly. The main objectives of this work are to: (1) demonstrate the CO2 removal capability of the BYS-SDC-carbonate membranes to facilitate SRM, and (2) assess H2 production enhancement by comparing the results from the membrane reactor and the conventional fixed-bed reactor."
1,Experimental,
2,Membrane synthesis and characterization,"2.1 Membrane synthesis and characterization BYS (Bi1.5Y0.3Sm0.2O3-δ) and SDC (Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ) powders were synthesized via liquid citric method as reported previously by our group [21]. For the synthesis of BYS, stoichiometric amounts of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, Y(NO3)3·6H2O and Sm(NO3)3·6H2O and solid citric acid (all from Alfa Aesar, at least 98% of purity, ACS reagent grade) were mixed together. For citric acid, the molar ratio of total metal ions to citrate is 1:2. The mixture was dissolved into a nitric acid solution (10 vol% HNO3) with continuous agitation. The solution was then heated to 250 °C to evaporate excess water. Once the water was removed, the remaining gel-like mixture was then heated up to 350 °C to bring up self-ignition for removal of carbon content. The waffle-like mixture produced after self-ignition was then collected and calcined at 850 °C for 5 h. The synthesis of SDC powders was achieved by the same method, but the water solution was prepared without addition of nitric acid and the powder was separated into two batches calcined at 950°C and 550 °C for 5 h respectively. The main reason for separating the SDC powder into two batches and calcine them at two different temperatures is to create SDC powders of two different particle sizes. As the outer permselective layer is only about 100 μm thick, it requires SDC powder (sintered at 550oC) with fine and uniform particle size to prevent defect. Moreover, the SDC calcined at 950 °C generally has particle size similar to BYS sintered at 850 °C. The yield for defect-free, high quality SDC-BYS support was higher when using uniform size particles. The tubular membrane was prepared via the centrifugal casting method patented by our group [32,33]. BYS-SDC slurry was first to be prepared with the powder composition of 55 wt% SDC (calcined at 950 °C) and 45 wt% BYS mixed with water in 50 wt%:50 wt%. A few drops of 3% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution was added to the mixture to improve mechanical strength of the ceramic body. The mixture was ball-milled at 175 rpm for at least 3 h to form a homogeneous slurry. SDC slurry was prepared via the same method by using SDC powder calcined at 550°C. The SDC slurry was then poured into a stainless-steel mold with inner diameter of 1.3 cm and sealed by rubber stoppers. Centrifugation was performed for 20 min at the rate of 4500 rpm to achieve solid-liquid separation, then the SDC layer was formed as the liquid was drained. The BYS-SDC slurry was added subsequently and the same centrifugation was performed again to make a support layer. The ceramic body was dried before detaching the mold in a humidity chamber at 40 °C with a relative humidity of 60% for at least 12 h. The asymmetric tube with a thin SDC layer and a BYS-SDC support layer was obtained after sintering at 1150 °C for 12 h. The sintered support was immersed directly into molten carbonate at 550 °C. The molten carbonate mixture consists Li2CO3, Na2CO3 and K2CO3 in molar ratio of 42.5:32.5:25. Due to the non-wettable property of BYS, only the SDC thin layer was infiltrated by the molten carbonate. The membrane synthesis was completed after the infiltration process. The membrane morphology and phase structure were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Amray 1910) and X-ray diffractometry (PanAlytical X'Pert Pro). Membrane samples before and after performing SRM reaction were both examined. Additional characterization information about energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) images for elemental distribution at the cross-section of the membrane, and pore size distribution of the membrane support (before molten carbonate infiltration), are presented in our previous work [34]."
3,CO2 permeation and steam reforming of methane (SRM) reaction,"2.2 CO2 permeation and steam reforming of methane (SRM) reaction Both non-reactive CO2 permeation test and SRM reaction were carried out on a built-in-house permeation set-up, as shown in Fig. 1 . The high temperature gas-tight sealing was achieved by a ceramic paste. The ceramic paste was prepared by mixing 40 wt% SDC powder, 50 wt% Pyrex powder and 10 wt% Al2O3·Na2O together and ground with a little amount of deionized water. After the ceramic paste was evenly applied and well dried, the system was heated to 750 °C in the rate of 1 °C/min and held for 2 h to melt the paste and achieve gas-tight sealing. Preliminary gas-tightness test was carried out by introducing 100 ml/min nitrogen on the feed side and 100 ml/min helium on the sweep side at 750 °C. If gas leakage occurred, N2 should be detected by the gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890A) from the permeate side. Only after gas-tightness is confirmed, the membrane would be used for subsequent experiments. In non-reactive CO2 permeation, a N2/CO2 mixture of 50%/50% molar ratio, 50 ml/min was supplied as the feed. In SRM tests, steam/methane (S/C) ratio was controlled at 3 and the CH4 flow rate was controlled at 5 ml/min. Deionized water was injected by a syringe pump into pre-heated stainless-steel pipe to generate steam. The tubular asymmetric dual-phase membranes were about 0.6 cm in I.D. and around 3.5 cm in length, with the effective permeation area of about 6.5–7.0 cm2. 0.2 g of Ni-based catalyst (HiFUEL R110) was mixed with 2 g fused silica (3M Ceradyne) uniformly before loaded in each experiment run. Both the catalyst and fused silica were crushed and sieved to 24–60 mesh grains. The catalyst was activated by 100 ml/min, 5 mol% H2/95 mol% He mixture at 800 °C for 8 h before use. Both sides of the membrane were maintained at atmospheric pressure in all tests. The gas composition was analyzed by a GC (Agilent 7890A) with a HayeSep DB 100/120 (AllTech) column. The flow rate of both feed-out and sweep-out streams were measured by a soap film flow meter. The CH4 conversion ( X C H 4 ) was calculated as follows: (1) X C H 4 = F C H 4 f e e d i n − F C H 4 f e e d o u t − F C H 4 s w e e p o u t F C H 4 f e e d i n × 100 % where F C H 4 f e e d i n , F C H 4 f e e d o u t and F C H 4 s w e e p o u t represent the CH4 flow rate of feed-in, feed-out and sweep-out gas stream in the membrane reactor, respectively. The CO2 recovery ( R C O 2 ) was calculated as follows: (2) R C O 2 = F C O 2 s w e e p o u t F C O 2 f e e d o u t + F C O 2 s w e e p o u t × 100 % where F C O 2 f e e d o u t and F C O 2 s w e e p o u t are the CO2 flow rate of feed-out and sweep-out stream, respectively. The hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 ) was calculated as follows: (3) Y H 2 = F H 2 f e e d o u t F C H 4 f e e d i n × 4 × 100 % where F H 2 f e e d o u t is the H2 flow rate of feed-out stream. For conventional fixed-bed experiments, the permeate side (sweep out in Fig. 1) was closed and the equilibrium of CO2 concentration was reached. In doing so, the reaction will take place under the same conditions except there will be no CO2 permeation flux across the membrane."
4,Results and discussions,
5,Membrane morphology,"3.1 Membrane morphology The as-synthesized tubular membrane exhibits a two-layered asymmetric wall structure, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). The EDS elemental mapping presents the difference in compositions between the two layers. As Fig. 2(b) shows, bismuth (red dots) mainly presents in the inner support layer. Fig. 2(c) and (d) present the high magnification view of the support layer and the permselective layer, respectively. The figures clearly show the dense structure of the SDC-carbonate layer and the porous structure of the support layer. The repellent property of BYS likely results from the acidity of bismuth. Since the molten carbonate is also mildly acidic, the surface energy will be higher when the molten carbonate contacts BYS ceramic surface. The presence of Bi element in the dense layer showing in the EDS elemental mapping could be resulted from (1) small amount of powder from support layer fall onto the dense layer when preparing the sample (2) inaccuracy of the instrument (3) minor diffusion of Bi into the dense layer during the sintering process. Despite the minor presence of Bi, it can be seen that the concentration of Bi in the support layer is clearly much higher than in the dense layer. The minor presence of Bi does not affect the property of the dense layer. It should be noted that all the membranes used in this work had the thin SDC layer on the outer side of the tube, which is different from what we reported previously [34]. The purposes for this change are to (1) increase membrane area per unit length and (2) expose the more stable SDC layer against the reaction."
6,CO2 permeation properties of BYS-SDC asymmetric membrane,"3.2 CO2 permeation properties of BYS-SDC asymmetric membrane Non-reactive CO2 permeation experiments were conducted to evaluate the general CO2 permeation performance of the membrane. As shown in Fig. 3 , the CO2 permeance ranges from 7.8 × 10−8 mol∙m−2∙s−1∙Pa−1 to 2.24 × 10−7 mol∙m−2∙s−1∙Pa−1 and the CO2 permeation flux ranges from 0.37 ml cm−2∙min−1 to 1.71 ml∙cm−2∙min−1. When SRM is carried out in the membrane reactor, CO2 flux decreases in membrane reactor when S/C > 3, as presented in Fig. 4 . The phenomenon is likely due to excess steam diluting the CO2 concentration and lowering the driving force for CO2 permeation. Whereas when S/C is low, the conversion is lower and fewer CO2 is produced, which results in lower driving force and hence lower permeation flux. Fig. 5 presents CO2 permeation flux and CO2 recovery of the membrane reactor while performing SRM reaction at 700–900 °C, respectively. In the reactive conditions, CO2 flux reaches from 0.15 ml∙cm−2∙min−1 to 0.4 ml∙cm−2∙min−1. Hydrogen in the permeate stream could not be detected by GC so under such experimental conditions the membrane only permeates CO2. The CO2 recovery ranges from 42 to 84%. The CO2 recovery is remarkably high compared with the symmetric WGS membrane reactor reported previously [28]. The significantly improved CO2 recovery indicates that the reduced membrane thickness effectively enhances the performance of the membrane reactor in terms of CO2 capture capability. Fig. 6 compares CO2 permeation fluxes under SRM reactive conditions with those under non-reaction conditions obtained in this work, and similar results for thicker membranes with and without WGS reactions. The fact that the CO2 permeation fluxes under reaction conditions (note the reactive gas is in the feed instead of the permeate) are lower than under non-reaction conditions is because under reaction conditions the CO2 partial pressure in the reacting gas for SRM or WGS (at total pressure of 1 atm) is lower, and hence a lower driving force for CO2 permeation, than under non-reaction conditions (CO2 partial pressure is 0.5 atm in this work). The apparent activation energies for CO2 permeation in both non-reactive and reactive conditions were calculated via an Arrhenius plot. As Fig. 6 shows, the apparent activation energy measured in this work (64.7 kJ/mol) is lower than previously reported thick membrane (83.3 kJ/mol) for non-reactive permeation. The difference might be caused by the effect of surface reaction rate. When the membrane is relatively thick, CO2 permeation is controlled by transport of oxygen and carbonate in the bulk of the SDC and molten carbonate phase respectively, and the permeation flux is proportional to the membrane total conductance, which can be expressed as follows [29]: (4) α = φ p σ c φ s σ i φ p σ c + φ s σ i where σ c and σ i are the carbonate ionic conductivity of the carbonate phase and oxygen ionic conductivity of the ceramic phase, respectively. φp and φs represent the geometric factor of the pore and solid phase of the support, respectively. More specifically, φp equals to porosity (ε) to tortuosity (τ) ratio (φp = ε/τ), and φs is the relative cross-sectional area for solid phase to the solid tortuosity. In the case of SDC-carbonate membrane, σ c is much larger than σ i , and α can be approximated as: (5) α ~ φ s σ i ( T ) Under such a scenario, the permeation activation energy is determined by the activation energy of σ i . However, literature also suggests that when the membrane thickness is reduced to a certain extent, surface reaction rate might become significant to permeation rate [35,36]. Suppose the activation energy for the surface reaction involved in conversion between CO2/O2− and CO3 2− is lower than the oxygen ionic activation energy in the SDC solid phase, the measured apparent activation energy for CO2 permeation through the thin SDC-carbonate membrane will become lower compared with the bulk-transport-control case. The activation energies measured by Chen et al. [37] on membranes with various thickness also decrease when reducing membrane thickness, which provides evidence to support this explanation. The comparison of membranes reported in literature and this work is presented in Table 1 . From the above analysis and activation energy data, we can conclude that the surface reaction for SDC-carbonate membrane likely has lower activation energy than the oxygen ionic conductivity σ i in the SDC phase. Another noteworthy phenomenon displayed in Fig. 6 is that the activation energy for CO2 permeation in SRM condition is further decreased, whereas the activation energy in the WGS reactor (90.8 kJ/mol) is slightly larger than non-reactive permeation (83.3 kJ/mol). Also, the Arrhenius plot of SRM data show non-linearity, hence the data were divided into two sections, 700–800 °C and 800–900 °C, and regressed separately. Two activation energies were calculated (70.3 kJ/mol and 19.2 kJ/mol), representing each section. It can be explained by the comparison of the trend of conversion with respect to temperature from the two reactors, as shown in Fig. 7 . For the experiments with the thick, symmetric membrane reactor, WGS was conducted under catalyst-free conditions. Thus, the WGS reaction rate is slow and conversion is low. Under such conditions, both WGS reaction kinetic and oxygen ionic conductivity in SDC affect CO2 permeation. The higher activation energy in the WGS case reflects the contribution of WGS reaction kinetic (higher than 88 kJ/mol with a catalyst [38]). On the contrary, SRM was performed with an efficient SRM catalyst in the asymmetric membrane reactor. The lower CO2 permeation flux with SRM (as compared to non-reactive gas) is due to lower driving force for CO2 permeation as explained above. This is because under reaction conditions the CO2 partial pressure in the reactive gas for SRM is lower than in the non-reactive condition, which results lower the CO2 permeation fluxes. The activation energy for permeation with reactive gas under SRM at lower temperatures (700–800 °C) is similar to that for permeation with non-reactive gas (see Table 1). The apparent activation energy decreases with increasing temperature due to the surface reaction (with lower activation energy as discussed above) more likely becoming the rate-determining factor."
7,SRM in the asymmetric membrane reactor,"3.3 SRM in the asymmetric membrane reactor Fig. 8 compares CH4 conversion and H2 yield for SRM in the membrane reactor with that in the fixed-bed reactor under the same conditions. As presented in the figure, the membrane reactor only provides slight promotion in CH4 conversion in comparison with the conventional fixed-bed reactor. Since the membrane can provide sufficiently high CO2 flux only when the temperature is at least about 700 °C, the reactor was run at high temperatures. In such conditions, CH4 conversion is already very high and the room for promoting conversion becomes very limited. In spite of that, the conversion data indicate the membrane reactor is capable of achieving almost equilibrium conversion. The major advantage of this type of membrane reactor is to enhance H2 yield. In addition, such an effect of CO2 removal becomes more prominent with increasing temperature as the CO2 flux increases with increasing temperature, also as shown in Fig. 8. At 900 °C, the H2 yield in membrane reactor reaches about 90%, which presents remarkable improvement from about 81% out of the conventional fixed-bed reactor. Moreover, the use of the asymmetric membrane has apparent effects on product composition. As shown in Fig. 9 , the output H2 concentration is improved from 76% to 88% (dry-based) by the membrane reactor. Meanwhile, the CO concentration (presented in Fig. 10 ) is reduced from 18% to 9% (dry-based) at 900 °C. The concentration changes evidently show that the membrane reactor effectively improves WGS conversion. Fig. 11 presents the product composition change from 700 to 900 °C in the membrane reactor. Despite high CO conversion at high temperature, CO2 concentration in the retentate still decreases with increasing temperature as the thin asymmetric membrane offers very effective in situ CO2 removal. Due to limited capability of our set-up, SRM with pressurized feed and vacuum on the permeate side was not demonstrated. Implementing these two techniques will create a greater CO2 pressure gradient across the membrane and maximize the performance of this membrane reactor. In doing so, the membrane reactor can potentially produce high concentration of H2 with pure CO2 capture in single stage. Nevertheless, without the high pressure data, the results of the experiments conducted at 1 atm still show that this new membrane reactor concept for SRM process poses great potential for process intensification, as no other existing technology have the capability of simultaneous production of high purity, high pressure H2 and separation of CO2 from the reactant/product stream."
8,Membrane stability,"3.4 Membrane stability For a given membrane, the SRM membrane reactor test at high temperatures typically lasted about 100 h when a sudden increase in hydrogen concentration in the permeate, from zero (undetectable by GC) to about 8%, was observed. With 200 ml/min He sweep, this means a hydrogen permeation flux of about 24 cc/min. Such large flux was due to failure in sealant and the part of the membrane attached to the sealing, as thin cracks near the edge of the membrane were observed after membrane was removed from the reactor. However, the bulk part of the membrane remained in good integrity. The post-test membranes removed from the reactor were examined by SEM and XRD and the results (shown in Figs. 12 and 13) are compared with the fresh membranes in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 12 (a), the reaction side of a post-test sample shows some recrystallization of carbonates, which is likely formed in the cooling process. Other difference besides from the recrystallization was not observed, for both reaction and sweep side. As for the XRD patterns (Fig. 13), although the post-test membrane sample shows slightly weaker X-ray diffraction intensity, there are no other discernible difference in the material phase structure. Both the characterization results indicate that the membrane has good chemical stability under SRM conditions."
9,Conclusions,"The asymmetric, thin BYS-SDC ceramic-carbonate membrane reactor can effectively convert methane to hydrogen via SRM with CO2 removal. The results of this study clearly suggest that the CO2 removal capability of the asymmetric thin ceramic-carbonate membrane reactor can produce high concentration H2 in a single-stage membrane reactor with CO and CO2 in the retentate stream reduced to a minimal level. As a result, the reactor footprint can be significantly reduced as no extra WGS unit is needed. CO2 permeation fluxes for the ceramic-dual phase membranes with reactive gas feed are lower than with non-reactive gas feed under similar conditions, with varying activation energy depending on the relative reaction rate and CO2 permeation mechanism. The work shows a new membrane process to produce high purity H2 stream directly from the reactor with simultaneous separation of CO2. SEM and XRD analysis suggest that the membrane has good chemical stability in SRM environment."
