0,Introduction,"By adapting to the requirements of the global energy strategy of reducing the dependence on fossil energy as well as the global CO2 emission, it is necessary to enhance the utilization of renewable energy sources and to develop an efficient chemical process to trap, remove and convert CO2 into useful materials [1,2]. Direct CO2 conversion into liquid alcohols by utilizing renewable energy mainly from the sun is proposed as the viable industrial process to close the carbon cycle [3,4]. Among them, ethanol is not only low toxicity and transportable but is also an important gasoline additive and liquid fuel, representing one of the cleanest resources [5,6]. However, CO2 conversion is limited by its thermodynamic stability, which leads to a low CO2 reactivity and a high reaction temperature [7,8]. In addition, it is scientifically challenging to retain the C–O bond during the specified C–C coupling due to the chemical inertness of CO2 [9,10], thus, resulting in methanol (CH3OH) or C1–C5 mixed alcohols as the main product [11,12]. Therefore, the low selectivity to ethanol is still the major hurdle in the effective conversion of CO2 into a useful energy source. Currently, the catalysts used for direct CO2/CO hydrogenation to ethanol are mainly based on the modified methanol or Fischer–Tropsch catalysts. The synthesis of higher alcohols (C2+OH) was achieved by incorporating alkali metals in the methanol catalysts, e.g., Cu–Zn [13,14], Cu–Co [15] and Cu–Fe [16,17] catalysts, at 230–270 °C. However, the ethanol selectivity is still unsatisfactory with methanol as the dominant product. On the other hand, the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) operated at much higher temperatures (>300 °C) with the modified Fe or Co-based catalysts [18–20]. The alcohol fraction is limited to the Anderson–Schulz–Flory distribution. Therefore, it remains a great challenge in achieving high ethanol selectivity even in the presence of additives. There is no doubt that the design of an efficient catalyst operating at low temperature could effectively mitigate the low ethanol selectivity problem while meeting the requirements of low energy consumption, although the development of such a catalyst is still a challenge. Recently, new catalysts based on Cu and Co were reported with improved performance in the C–C coupling [21,22]. The controllable carbon chain growth was noted to be dependent on the well-defined, high-quality crystal structure and regularity of the active sites. Furthermore, the single-atom catalyst (SAC) features uniformly distributed active sites and the ability to precisely control the activity at the atomic level [23–25]. Our previous reports also suggested that the bifunctional SAC was more conducive to improving ethanol selectivity [25]. Herein, the bifunctional SACs have been designed and constructed for the controlled C–C coupling by anchoring Rh atom on the exposed (101) surface of a one-dimensional β­Mo2C nanowire. High-quality crystal structure of Mo2C benefits from the unique metal d-band electronic structure, effectively catalyzing CO2 to methanol in liquid [26,27]. Meanwhile, the Rh-based complex catalyst is responsible for methanol carbonylation [28]. The synergistic effects of the two active centres help to improve the selectivity of ethanol to 44.6%. By increasing the Rh loading, the electronic state of the carrier and metal were changed, resulting in the unbalanced kinetics between the hydrogenation of CO2 and the C–C coupling. In such a case, the ethanol selectivity decreased. More importantly, by introducing K to modulate the reactivity of β-Mo2C, the balance between the reaction rates for CO2 hydrogenation and C–C coupling was recovered and the synergistic effects were optimized. Under the optimized condition for the K/Rh/β-Mo2C catalyst, the excellent ethanol selectivity of 72.1% was achieved with the ethanol yield of 33.7 μmol g−1h−1 at 150 °C."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Mo2C nanowires were prepared via employing organic–inorganic hybrid nanocomposites as precursors. 2.48 g of ammonium heptamolybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) was dissolved in 40 mL aqueous solution, followed by adding 3.34 g of aniline. Then, 1 M HCl solution was added dropwise into the above solution under vigorous magnetic stirring until the pH value reached 4–5. After stirring at 50 °C for 4 h, the organic–inorganic precursor Mo3O10(C6H8N)2·2H2O nanowires were synthesized, filtrated and washed with ethanol, and then dried at 60 °C overnight. After keeping in 5 vol% H2/Ar at RT for 1 h to remove the air from the pipe, the dried precursor was heated to 600–800 °C at a ramping rate of 2 °C/min, and kept at the corresponding temperature for 4 h with continuous flow of 5 vol% H2/Ar to get target Mo2C nanowires. After cooled to RT, the samples were passivated with 1 vol% O2/Ar for 1 h to avoid spontaneous combustion in air. The 1D α-MoC1- x and β-Mo2C which was calcined at the temperature of 650 °C and 750 °C, respectively. The three-dimensional (3D) Mo2C precursor was obtained by simply mixing aqueous solutions of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and melamine. 1.0 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O was dissolved in 25 mL aqueous solution, and 1.0 g of melamine was dissolved in 100 mL aqueous solution. Heating the aqueous solution to 80 °C is to dissolve melamine completely, whereas a moderate temperature (40 °C) facilitates the fast and thorough dissolution of ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O). After being fully dissolved, the two solutions were mixed, and a white precipitate formed immediately. The white solid was collected after aging for 2 h, then dried in an oven at 80 °C for 3 h and was designated as the Mo-melamine precursor. After keeping in 5 vol% H2/Ar at RT for 1 h to remove the air from the pipe, the dried precursor was heated to the target temperature at a ramping rate of 5 °C /min, and kept at the corresponding temperature 500–700 °C for 1 h. After cooled to RT, the samples were passivated with 1 vol% O2/Ar for 1 h to passivate the sample surface to avoid bulk oxidation. The supported Rh catalysts with various Rh contents were prepared via an equivalent-volume impregnation method by adding the above Mo2C into the appropriate concentration of RhCl3 aqueous solution. The samples were dried at 80 °C overnight, calcined in Ar at 450 °C for 2 h, and reduced with 50 vol% H2/Ar at 300 °C for 1 h. After cooled to RT, the samples were passivated with 1 vol% O2/Ar for 1 h. In these obtained Rhx/Mo2C catalysts, x means the theoretical mass fraction (wt%) of Rh, x = 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5. K/Rh/Mo2C catalysts were prepared via an equivalent-volume impregnation method. Firstly, the appropriate volume 1 M K2CO3 solution was dropwise added into the Mo2C carrier. Then, the samples were dried at 80 °C overnight, calcined in Ar at 450 °C for 2 h. The optimized Ky/Mo2C samples with various K contents were obtained (y means the mass fraction of K). In the same way, the supported Rh catalysts were prepared via the equivalent-volume impregnation method by adding the above K/Mo2C samples into the appropriate concentration of RhCl3 aqueous solution. Then, the samples were dried at 80 °C overnight, calcined in Ar at 450 °C for 2 h, and reduced with 50 vol% H2/Ar at 300 °C for 1 h. After cooled to RT, the samples were passivated with 1 vol% O2/Ar for 1 h. The modified K/Mo2C catalysts with various K contents were prepared via an equivalent-volume impregnation method by adding the Mo2C into the 1 M K2CO3 solution. The samples dried at 80 °C overnight, calcined in Ar at 450 °C for 2 h, and reduced with 50 vol% H2/Ar at 300 °C for 1 h. After cooled to RT, the samples were passivated with 1 vol% O2/Ar for 1 h. In these obtained Ky/Mo2C catalysts, y means the mass fraction of K. And the other comparative catalysts including supports (MgO, ZnO) were following the method of Rh/Mo2C preparation."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a PANalytical X’Pert-Pro X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm), operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and the corresponding elemental mapping images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100F. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were recorded by a Thermofisher ESCALAB 250Xi instrument, employing monochromated Al Kα radiation (hυ = 1486.6 eV) as the X-ray source. The spectrometer was operated at 15 kV and 20 mA. The binding energies were calibrated by setting the C 1s adventitious carbon peak position to 284.6 eV. The X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) at Mo k-edge of the samples were performed at the 1W1B station of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), China. A double Si (111) crystal monochromator was used for energy selection. Before measurements, the samples were reduced in H2 flow at 300 °C for 1 h, followed by sealing with Capton film in a glove box. The data were collected at room temperature in the fluorescence mode. The Athena software package was used to analyze the data. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) were performed on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector, recorded with a resolution of 4 cm−1. Before DRIFTS experiments, the sample was first pretreated in H2/Ar flow at 300 °C for 1 h, followed by purging with Ar at 300 °C for 0.5 h, after which the background spectrum was collected. Then, the temperature was reduced to 150 °C, the Ar flow was switched to CO2/Ar flow and maintained for 0.5 h to achieve saturated CO2 adsorption. Subsequently, the system was purged with Ar to remove non-absorbed CO2 for 40 min, such that CO2 adsorption at 150 °C was acquired. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. The sample was first pretreated with Ar at 120 °C for 1 h before TPR measurement. After cooling down to room temperature (RT), a 10 vol% H2/Ar flow was introduced into the system by heating the sample from RT to 1000 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920. Prior to the measurements, the samples were degassed at 300 °C for 1 h in He. Then, the catalysts were exposed to CO2/He at 50 °C. After the baseline was stable, CO2 pulse adsorption was carried out until saturation. Being flushed with He for 30 min, the CO2 desorption curves were obtained by GC–MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) with heating the samples from 50 to 1000 °C at 10 °C /min in He flow. H2/D2 exchange experiment was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920. The samples were treated at 300 °C for 1 h in H2. Then, cooled to 20 °C, and D2 was introduced to contact the heterogeneous catalyst with H2 and undergo isotope exchange. The H/D exchange curves were obtained by GC–MS with heating the samples from 20 to 600 °C at 10 °C/min."
4,Catalytic evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic evaluation The CO2 hydrogenation reaction was performed at 150 °C with stirring at a speed of 400 rpm for 10 h. After the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the gaseous mixture was collected and then analyzed using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with an HP-5 column connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The liquid mixture was collected by centrifugation and was analyzed using an Agilent 7890B GC equipped with an HP-FFAP column connected to a flame ionization detector (FID), in which a known amount of decane was introduced into the liquid mixture as an internal standard. The catalytic tests were repeated three times for each catalyst. The selected stirrer speed is as high as 400 r/min and the catalyst was ground before use), the space–time yield (STY) reported here is calculated by the equation as follows: (1) S T Y M e t h a n o l = C M e t h a n o l × V m c a t × t (2) S T Y E t h a n o l = C E t h a n o l × V m c a t × t where C Methanol and C Ethanol are the methanol and ethanol concentration, respectively, monitored by GC, m is the mass of catalyst, and t is the initial time of the catalytic reaction, 10 h."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structure of the catalyst,"3.1 Structure of the catalyst To achieve the controlled C–C coupling during the CO2 hydrogenation, Mo2C was selected as the carrier for the construction of the bifunctional SACs. Mo2C exhibits an excellent catalytic performance similar to those of the noble metals for the CO2 hydrogenation while providing abundant active sites for anchoring the noble metal single atoms. The “single-source precursor method” was adopted to avoid the issue of carbon enrichment on the surface [29,30]. This was generally observed during the conventional preparation method based on gas carbonization (such as CO, CH4, C2H2, etc.), as the diffusion direction of the C atoms changes from the inwards to the outwards [31]. With the single-source precursor, the 1D Mo2C nanowires were obtained, confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. S1) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Fig. 1 a). The obtained sample shows well-defined morphology with a smooth surface which could be precisely adjusted by controlling the solution pH from 5.4 to 4.1 (Fig. S1–S3). From the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Fig. 1b), the uniform sub-nanometer periodic lattice (∼0.23 nm) corresponding to the (101) crystal lattice was identified, confirmed with the selected area electron diffraction (SAED, inset in Fig. 1b) pattern. For a complex catalytic system, a well-defined surface crystal structure of the Mo2C carrier is conducive for establishing the structure–activity relationships and for refining the surface property. The different morphologies (three-dimensional Mo2C powder) and crystalline structures (α or β) could be obtained by varying the carbon source precursor and calcination temperature (Fig. 1c, S4 and S5)."
7,Catalytic testing,"3.2 Catalytic testing The as-prepared catalysts were employed for CO2 hydrogenation in a 1,4 dioxane solution (initial pressure = 6.0 MPa). Both gaseous and liquid samples were analyzed after the reaction completion. As observed in Fig. 2 (a), pure Mo2C was active for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, and no obvious gaseous products were detected at the low reaction temperature of 150 °C. On the other hand, the 1D Mo2C nanowires with exposed (101) facets had higher activity than the 3D Mo2C powder. Significantly, the β-phase Mo2C revealed a higher methanol activity than the α-MoC1- x . The DFT calculations demonstrated that the CO2 molecule was most likely activated at either the triangular Mo–C–Mo sites on the α-MoC1- x surface or the Mo–Mo sites on the β-Mo2C surface [32]. The difference in the active sites may be the primary reason for the observed difference in the methanol activity. Subsequently, the effect of temperature has also been examined for β-Mo2C. Small ethanol with 23.1% selectivity was obtained by increasing the temperature to 200 °C (Table S1). It indicated that at high temperatures, β-Mo2C assisted some probability of C–C coupling, thus, represented by a low ethanol selectivity. Hence, the 1D β-Mo2C nanowires are more suitable for CO2 hydrogenation to form the single carbon product (methanol) at mild conditions. To improve the C–C coupling activity, Rh was immobilized on the β-Mo2C surface forming the bifunctional active centre. After depositing Rh atoms by the impregnation method, the β-Mo2C morphology did not change significantly, shown in Fig. S6–S8. From the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis (HAADF-STEM, Fig. 1d), the Rh species existed exclusively as the isolated single atoms on the surface of Rh0.2/β-Mo2C, with no sub-nanometer clusters or nanoparticles (Fig. S9), which is in agreement with the previous observations. The TEM and SEM-EDS images in Fig. 1(e) also show no nanoscale Rh phases. By increasing the Rh to 0.5%, small clusters were observed in Fig. 1(f). Aggregated and non-uniform Rh nanoparticles were formed once the Rh loading was increased to 1%, shown in Fig. 1(g), although the XRD patterns in Fig. S10 did not present any Rh-containing crystal phases, most likely due to the low concentration of Rh. After introducing the atomic Rh species on the β-Mo2C nanowires, the C2 alcohol (ethanol) was detected at 150 °C. From Fig. 2(b), the Rh0.2/β-Mo2C catalyst offered significant-high carbon chain growth activity at low temperatures, achieving an ethanol selectivity of 44.6% with an ethanol yield of 28.4 μmol g−1h−1. Considering that Rh is an active metallic catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO/CO2 to ethanol [33], the effect of the β-Mo2C was analyzed by replacing it with other solids (e.g., ZnO, MgO, Table S2). Under the same low-temperature condition, the 0.2% Rh catalyst on ZnO or MgO could not complete the C–C coupling independently and effectively. Hence, β-Mo2C was confirmed to play an important role in the multifunctional catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2 and C–C coupling. To further improve the ethanol production, the density of Rh sites was optimized. Although a higher Rh loading promoted the ethanol yield, the selectivity of ethanol did not increase correspondingly. This demonstrated a negative correlation with the catalytic activity. For Rh1.5/β-Mo2C, the ethanol yield was increased to 43.7 μmol g−1h−1, whereas the ethanol selectivity was significantly suppressed to 10.2%. Based on the STEM characterization, it could be suggested that the increase of Rh may only enhance the number of single Rh atoms to a certain extent. Oversupply of Rh could lead to the aggregation of Rh atoms forming Rh clusters or nanoparticles, which is favorable for the methanol formation. The temperature is an important factor in the hydrogenation process. As presented in Fig. 2(c and d), a higher ethanol yield could be obtained at 200 °C as compared with 150 °C, however, the methanol production was increased at a faster rate, from 35.2 to 195.4 μmol g−1h−1 on Rh0.2/β-Mo2C. It effectively reduced the ethanol selectivity. In the case of Rh1.5/β­Mo2C, even traces of CO and CH4 were detected in the gas product after increasing the temperature to 200 °C."
8,The research of mechanism,"3.3 The research of mechanism To explore the mechanism for relatively high ethanol selectivity on the highly dispersed Rh0.2/β­Mo2C, the Rh/β­Mo2C samples were characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. S11). The Rh 3d spectrum only showed the peak of Rhδ+ at 308.0 eV [34]. However, with the increase of the Rh loading, the Rh BE shift to the lower energy and the element Rh0 species (306.0 eV) was formed. Analysis with the synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) did not reveal the Rh signal due to the interference between Mo (42) and Rh (45) as well as a strong X-ray absorption of the support. Considering the contribution of β­Mo2C in the reaction, the impact of Rh dispersion on the carrier cannot be ignored. The high-resolution Mo 3d spectrum (Fig. 3 a-d) could be well-fitted into four pairs of peaks, indicating that the Mo species with different valence charges (+2, +3, +4, and +6) existed on the surface of the β-Mo2C nanowires [30,35]. The state area ratios are listed in Table S3. As observed, the Mo valence state population in the Rh0.2/β-Mo2C was very similar to that of β-Mo2C. With the increased Rh content, the BE of Mo 3d displayed a clear blueshift. As a result, the proportion of the Mo2+ gradually decreased, while the proportion of the Mo6+ was increased. The normalized X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra also confirmed the presence of largely Mo2+, with a small amount of Mo4+ and Mo6+ (Figs. S12 and S13) [36]. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of the K­edge of the k 2 χ(k) data exhibited the Mo–C coordination number of 5.9 (Table S4) with a weak Mo–O contribution in Rh0.2/β-Mo2C. With the increase of the Rh loading, the EXAFS signal of the Mo–C bond was almost constant, while the corresponding signal of the Mo–O bond was continuously increased, as shown in Fig. 3(e). The fitted data are also listed in Table S4. The wavelet transformation plot of Rh0.2/β-Mo2C in Fig. 3(f) demonstrated the presence of Mo–Mo and Mo–C bonds [37]. Although the presence of Rh did not affect the C state greatly, it did lead to the strengthening of the C–O peak strength with 1% Rh, as shown in the inductive C 1s spectrum (Fig. 4 a-d). The above phenomena are also consistent with the XRD (Fig. S10). The characteristic diffraction peak associated with the partial oxidation of Mo [38] was noted with its intensity gradually increasing. Therefore, increasing the Rh loading caused the oxidation of the β­Mo2C surface, gradually permeating into the bulk phase. To determine the influence of the electronic properties and surface Rh on the catalytic behavior, in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was employed. Consistent with the literature [30], apart from the IR adsorption from the physisorbed CO2, no other signal was observed on the pure β-Mo2C at 150 °C (Fig. S14). On the Rh0.2/β­Mo2C, the key intermediate Rhδ+–CO (2076 cm−1) [33,39], usually formed on the Rh metal oxide, was observed (Fig. S15). Combined with the Rh 3d XPS result, it suggested that the bonding of the surface O to the monoatomic Rhδ+ promoted the dissociative adsorption of CO2, and the product CO* was adsorbed on the monoatomic Rhδ+. Similarly, the non-monoatomic catalyst Rh1.0/β-Mo2C was also analyzed under the same conditions (Fig. S16). CO2 DRIFTS revealed that the Rhδ+–CO signal was enhanced with the peak corresponding to Rh0–CO appeared at 2057 cm−1. Based on the Blyholder theory [40], compared with Rhδ+, that a higher electron density feed into the CO 2π anti-bond orbit in the case of Rh0–CO will result in the weakening of the C–O and stabilizing the Rh–C bonds. Although it benefitted the hydrogenation reduction reaction, it was not conducive for the CO insertion reaction. By comparing with the H2 consumption at different temperatures in the temperature-programmed reduction (H2–TPR, Fig. S17), it can be concluded that at low temperatures (90 ∼ 160 °C), the hydrogen is more likely to be adsorbed and activated at a high Rh content with increased surface H concentration, which is sufficient to reduce the active intermediates directly to methanol (even methane). This is in full agreement with the observed catalytic behavior with high Rh loadings. Besides, Moδ+–CO, Mo2+–CO and Mo4+–CO exhibited the IR peaks at 2094, 2108 and 2129 cm−1 [41,42], respectively. The peaks at 1081, 1053 and 1033 cm−1 were assigned to the strongly adsorbed carbonates species (CO3 δ−) [43] formed on the Rh1.0/β­Mo2C. It indicated that the partial oxidation of β­Mo2C would alter the CO2 activation with the Rh accumulation. Hence, the bifunctional catalyst of monoatomic Rh on β­Mo2C was optimized for the C–C coupling to ethanol. The proposed reaction mechanism is shown in Scheme S1. The experimental findings confirmed that it was difficult to achieve the high ethanol selectivity by adjusting the Rh content alone, since the dispersion state of Rh is changed and the oxidation of the carrier is increased with the increase of Rh, resulting in dominant methanol (C1) production under mild conditions. The key of C–C coupling lies in the SAC bifunctional active centres, as the efficient carbon chain growth depends on the optimized synergy with the balance of the activities of the two catalytic pathways. To introduce extra control for improving the ethanol selectivity further, element K was deposited on the Rh/β­Mo2C as the cocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 2(e), the K0.2Rh0.2/β­Mo2C catalyst yields a higher ethanol selectivity of 72.1% and a higher ethanol production rate of 33.7 μmol g−1h−1 with respect to the Rh0.2/β-Mo2C. The performance was also superior to the precious-metal modified Mo2C-based catalysts (Table S5). TPD revealed strong adsorption of CO2 molecules, demonstrated with a higher CO2 desorption temperature in the presence of K, shown in Fig. S18. In addition, CO2 DRIFTS in Fig. S19 revealed the new IR peaks at 1081, 1008 and 945 cm−1 at 150 °C, which are assigned to the adsorbed carbonate species. Thus, the addition of K promoted the CO2 adsorption and activation on the β­Mo2C surface by generating more carbonates species. However, further increase of the K caused the decrease of the activity rapidly. The Rh 3d XPS spectrum of the K0.2Rh0.2/β-Mo2C in Fig. S20 showed no apparent shift in BE in comparison with the Rh0.2/β­Mo2C with Rh δ + as the main species. Similar behavior was observed from the C 1 s XPS spectrum (Fig. S21). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the alkali metal (K) did not affect the catalytic performance by altering the state of Rh and C. However, the XPS intensity of the Mo3+ peak was significantly enhanced, while the XPS intensity of the Mo2+ was reduced, which was expected to act as the active site for catalyzing CO2 to methanol [44] (Fig. S22). To further verify the effect of K on the methanol production over the β­Mo2C catalyst, a series of K/β­Mo2C catalysts with different K concentration were prepared for the CO2 hydrogenation. As shown in Fig. 2(f), the high K content inhibited the formation of methanol. Considering the effect of K on the CO2 activation, as observed in CO2-TPD and CO2 DRIFTS, H2 was focused on in this reaction. The ability of the K/β-Mo2C materials to activate the H–H bond was studied using the H/D exchange. The H/D exchange of H2 (conversion of H2 to HD) requires the H–H bond activation. Therefore, the measured exchange reflects a catalyst’s ability to cleave the H–H bond [45]. As shown in Fig. 3(g), the temperature-dependent HD formation was detected using an attached mass spectrometer. On the β­Mo2C and K0.2/β­Mo2C catalysts, the HD was observed at the sample temperatures of 102 °C and 130 °C, respectively, which were below the reaction temperature (150 °C). This temperature was further increased to 186 °C when the K content was increased to 1%. Hence, surface K atoms have negative effects on the H–H activation, and the excessive extent of K inhibited the H2 dissociation. This work confirmed that the cooperation of the bifunctional centres is essential for the synthesis of ethanol. The presence of K regulates the carrier properties, especially the methanol production by controlling the H2 activation, which in turn affects the coupling of the bifunctional centres. Therefore, within a reasonable range, the methanol production can be effectively reduced, while Rh retains the single atom nature to promote the C–C coupling."
9,Conclusions,"In conclusion, the 1D β-phase Mo2C nanowires with a specific crystal face (101) are successfully synthesized as the carrier for efficient CO2 hydrogenation. By depositing atomic Rh species on the β-Mo2C, the bifunctional SAC (Rh0.2/β­Mo2C) is produced for efficient ethanol formation with improved selectivity under mild reaction conditions. With the increase of Rh, nanoparticles are formed, which affects the balance of the bifunctional activities, resulting in the reduced ethanol selectivity. However, by the introduction of K, the methanol formation is successfully suppressed with much-improved ethanol production both in the yield and selectivity. The balanced synergistic bifunctional activities ensured the efficient ability for CO2 hydrogenation with excellent ethanol selectivity. The developed K/Rh/β-Mo2C catalytic systems offer high potential and a considerable practical value for efficient CO2 conversion. The controlled modification of the Mo-based catalysts provides a new strategy for the effective production of ethanol."
