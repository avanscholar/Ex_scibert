0,Introduction,"Nanoparticles (NPs) have shown great promise as carriers for small molecular drug delivery in cancer treatment (Chen, 2010; Ke et al., 2014a; Sun et al., 2014). They can not only enhance the water solubility but also increase the stability of the free drugs. In addition, with nano-size, NPs tend to accumulate at the tumor site after systemic administration due to the enhance permeation and retention (EPR) effect, which can decrease the toxicity to healthy tissues and enhance the anti-tumor activity of the payload (Maeda, 2015). Various non-covalent and covalent interactions have been employed for NP preparation, including hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding interaction, ionic interaction, chemical cross-linking and chemical conjugation, with the purpose of enhancing drug loading capacity and in vivo stability, and achieving controlled release (Ke et al., 2014a). The conventional NP preparation methods include solvent evaporation, nanoprecipitation, emulsification, salting-out, dialysis and supercritical fluid technology (Crucho and Barros, 2017; Kamaly et al., 2012). Except for the supercritical fluid technology, all the other methods need to dissolve the NP forming materials and/or drugs in organic solvents first, and then remove the organic solvents by either evaporation or dialysis after NP formation. The residue organic solvents are hazardous to the environment as well as physiological system. In addition, the preparation processes of these methods are typically tedious with multiple steps and can cause severe batch-to-batch variations, which significantly affect the clinical translation (Crucho and Barros, 2017; Kamaly et al., 2012). Although no organic solvent is involved in the supercritical fluid technology, the low solubility of the NP forming materials in the supercritical fluid limits its wide applications (Kankala et al., 2017). To allow scaled preparation, Prud’homme and co-workers have developed an easy and continuous method termed flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) for hydrophobic drug delivery using either a four stream multi inlet vortex (MIV) mixer or a two stream confined impingement jet (CIJ) mixer (Grundy et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2018; Johnson and Prud’homme, 2003a,b). In both cases, hydrophobic drug and amphiphilic polymer dissolved in a water-miscible organic solvent was rapidly mixed with water to induce high supersaturated conditions leading to the precipitation and encapsulation of the hydrophobic drug into the core of the NPs formed by the amphiphilic polymer. Recently, we have developed a new method named flash nanocomplexation (FNC) for the delivery of macromolecules such as DNA and proteins using MIV or CIJ devices in a scalable and reproducible manner (He et al., 2018; He et al., 2017; Qiao et al., 2018; Santos et al., 2016). Unlike FNP, no organic solvent is involved in this process, and the NPs were formed by ionic interactions instead of hydrophobic interactions. In this study, we further extended the FNC platform for the delivery of small molecular drug using curcumin (CUR) as a model and explored the potential of forming NPs via hydrogen bonding interactions. CUR is a nature diphenolic antioxidant that isolated from the rhizome of the herb Curcuma longa L (Lee et al., 2014). The anti-cancer effect of CUR has been demonstrated in various types of cancers including glioma, breast cancer, prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer etc. both in vitro and in vivo (Dhillon et al., 2008; Mock et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Yallapu et al., 2014). Its low water solubility and low stability in vivo rendered the development of various NP carriers such as polymeric NPs, polymeric micelles, liposomes, nanogels, and so on (Naksuriya et al., 2014). However, most of the NP systems were prepared in a small scale only suitable for laboratory research use. In addition, organic solvents were involved in these preparations. FNP also has been employed as a scalable method for CUR-loaded NP preparation (Cheng et al., 2013; Chow et al., 2014; Chow et al., 2015; Margulis et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2013). Dr Chow and his co-workers dissolved CUR and polyethylene glycol-b-poly(dl-lactide) (PEG-PLA) in a water miscible organic solvent (e.g. acetone, DMF or THF) and then mixed with water through a MIV or CIJ mixer to form NPs. Various polymer stabilizers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), Pluronic F-68, leucine and TPGS were also used to stabilize the NPs. The effect of organic solvent, type of mixer, fraction of PEG-PLA and polymer stabilizer on the physicochemical properties of the NPs were studied (Cheng et al., 2013; Chow et al., 2014; Chow et al., 2015). Hao et al. used a similar method by dissolving CUR and PEG-PLA or PLGA in THF separately and then mixed with water using a MIV mixer for the preparation of CUR-loaded NPs (Shen et al., 2013). The organic solvent was then removed by spay drying. In another case, Katherine et al. developed CUR-loaded NPs by rapidly mixing a CUR-loaded emulsion prepared by dissolving CUR in water, cyclopentanone and surfactants (e.g. ammonium glycyrrhizinate, dipotassium glycyrrhizinate and soybean phosphatidylcholine) with water using a CIJ mixer (Margulis et al., 2014). The obtained NP solution was further dried using spay drying (Margulis et al., 2014). In all these formulations, organic solvents were involved, and extra steps were needed to remove the organic solvent. Tannic acid is a type of nature polyphenol extracted from plants and is generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Ejima et al., 2013). Due to the presence of plentiful catechol and pyrogallol groups, tannic acid has been used as hydrogen bonding donors to form NPs, hydrogen-bonded multilayer films or microparticles with hydrogen bond acceptor-containing polymers such as poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) or bovine serum albumin (Le et al., 2018; Lomova et al., 2015; Shin et al., 2015). In the present study, we developed a new NP formulation for CUR delivery via hydrogen bonding interactions using FNC as a scalable and reproducible platform. In particular, no organic solvent was involved in this process. Three NPs with different drug loading levels were prepared by tuning the feeding amount of CUR. The NPs were characterized by particle size, size distribution, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and stability. The FNC method was also compared with the bulk mixing method in terms of scalability and reproducibility. The effect of drug loading level on the interactions of the CUR-loaded NPs with cancer cells were investigated in human prostate cancer PC3 cells by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy imaging and cytotoxicity assay."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials CUR (99.5% pure), tannic acid, PVA (87–89% hydrolyzed), and Hoechst 33,342 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and alamarBlueTM cell viability reagent were from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Uranyl acetate (UA) was purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was from MP Biomedicals. Human prostate cancer PC3 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere."
3,Preparation of CUR-loaded NPs,"2.2 Preparation of CUR-loaded NPs CUR-loaded NPs with different drug loading levels were prepared using the FNC method. In brief, 0.3, 0.6, or 1 mg CUR was dissolved in 1 mL 0.01 M NaOH aqueous solution, and then rapidly mixed with an equal volume of tannic acid solution (1 mg/mL, 50 mM HEPES, pH 5.2) and PVA solution (0.6 mg/mL, pH 7) through a three-inlet MIV mixer at flow rate of 10 mL/min. The free CUR was then removed by ultracentrifugation using Amicon centrifugal filter with molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 30 kDa at 2,500 rpm for 30 min."
4,Characterizations of CUR-loaded NPs,"2.3 Characterizations of CUR-loaded NPs The particle size, size distribution and zeta potential were measured using DTS Zeta sizer Nano (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). All the samples were measured in triplicates. The loading efficiency and drug loading level of the NPs were quantified using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (UV mini 1240 Shimadzu, Japan). A known amount of drug-loaded NPs was dissolved in DMSO and the absorbance of the solution was measured at 423 nm to determine CUR content. The standard curves of CUR in DMSO were constructed to determine the drug concentrations. The loading efficiency and the drug loading level were then calculated using the following formulas: loading efficiency % = (mass of drug loaded in NPs/mass of feeding drug) × 100%; drug loading level % = (mass of CUR loaded in micelles/mass of CUR-loaded NPs) × 100%. The stability of the CUR-loaded NPs was evaluated by monitoring the size change of the NPs at 4 °C with or without the presence of 10% FBS over time."
5,TEM imaging,"2.4 TEM imaging The morphology and size distribution of the CUR-loaded NPs were further characterized using TEM. The samples were prepared by incubating 10 µL of NP solution onto an ionized nickel grid covered with a carbon film. After 10 min, the solution was gently removed, and a 10 µL drop of 2% UA was added to the grid. The staining was stopped by removing the UA solution after 30 s, and the grid was dried at room temperature. The samples were then imaged using a Technai FEI-12 electron microscope."
6,Comparison of FNC and bulk mixing,"2.5 Comparison of FNC and bulk mixing The effect of the adding sequence on the particle size and size distribution in bulk mixing was first evaluated. In this analysis, small scale preparation was used (50 µL for each solution) to achieve efficient mixing. Three different adding sequences were evaluated: (seq. 1) CUR was mixed with PVA first, and then mixed with tannic acid; (seq. 2) CUR was mixed with tannic acid first, and then mixed with PVA; and (seq.3) tannic acid was mixed with PVA first, and then mixed with CUR. The mixing process was achieved by vortexing for 1 min. Additionally, the scalability of the FNC and bulk mixing method was compared. For FNC method, 10 mL CUR solution, 10 mL tannic acid solution and 10 mL PVA solution was rapidly mixed using MIV mixer. The particle size and size distribution of the obtained NPs were compared with those of the NPs prepared using 1 mL of each solution under the same conditions. For bulk mixing preparation, 1 mL CUR solution was mixed with 1 mL PVA solution first, and then 1 mL tannic acid solution was added into the mixture solution by vortexing for 1 min. The reproducibility of the FNC and bulk mixing was further compared by measuring the particle size and size distribution of the NPs prepared in three separated batches using dynamic light scattering. For bulk mixing, small scale preparation (50 µL for each solution) and adding seq. 1 were used."
7,In vitro release,"2.6 In vitro release The in vitro release of CUR from the three NPs were investigated using dialysis method. In brief, 1 mL of CUR-loaded NPs was loaded into a dialysis bag with MWCO 300 kDa and then immersed into 30 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 80. At predesigned time points, 1 mL of the release medium was collected, and an equal volume of fresh medium was added. The concentration of CUR in the release medium was measure using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer at 423 nm."
8,Flow cytometry analysis,"2.7 Flow cytometry analysis PC3 cells were cultured in 24-well plate at a cell density of 50,000 cells/well. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator, the medium was removed, and the cells were treated with pure CUR or CUR-loaded NPs with different loading levels at CUR concentrations of 10 µg/mL in fresh medium for 4 h. The cells without any treatment were used as control. The cells were then washed with cold PBS for three times, collected by adding trypsin solution, and followed by fixing using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution. The fluorescence intensities of the cells were then measured by flow cytometry (Sony Biotechnology SH800 Cell Sorter, Japan)."
9,Confocal microscopy imaging,"2.8 Confocal microscopy imaging PC3 cells were seeded at a cell density of 40,000 cells/well in 8-chamber glass slide and incubated at 37 °C for overnight. The medium was then replaced by fresh medium containing pure CUR or CUR-loaded NPs with different drug loadings at CUR concentration of 10 µg/mL. The cells without any treatment were used as control. After 4 h of incubation, Hoechst 33,342 was added into each well to a final concentration of 10 µg/mL and the cells were further incubated for another 10 min. The medium was then discarded, and the cells were washed with cold PBS for three times before imaged under the confocal fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany)."
10,Cytotoxicity of CUR-loaded NPs,"2.9 Cytotoxicity of CUR-loaded NPs The in vitro cytotoxicity of CUR-loaded NPs was evaluated in human prostate cancer PC3 cells. The cells were seeded in 96-well plate at a cell density of 10,000 cells/well. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator, the medium was removed, and the cells were treated with free CUR or CUR-loaded NPs with different loading levels at CUR concentrations ranging from 3.125 to 100 µg/mL. The cells without any treatment were used as negative control. After 48 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% (v/v) Alamar Blue reagent, and the cells continued to be incubated at 37 °C for another 4 h. The fluorescence was then read on a microplate reader following the manufacturer’s protocol."
11,Statistical analysis,"2.10 Statistical analysis All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results were presented as mean ± standard deviation. The experimental data was analyzed using two-tailed Student’s t-test. Statistical significance was accepted at a level of p < 0.05."
12,Results,
13,Preparation and characterizations of CUR-loaded NPs,"3.1 Preparation and characterizations of CUR-loaded NPs CUR-loaded NPs were prepared by mixing CUR, tannic acid and PVA rapidly using a three-inlet MIV mixer at flow rate 10 mL/min (Scheme 1 ). In order to investigate the effect of drug loading level, three NPs with low, medium and high drug loading levels as designated NP1, NP2 and NP3 were prepared by tuning the feeding amount of CUR. All the three NPs showed small particle size (46, 58 and 67 nm for NP1, NP2 and NP3 respectively) with narrow size distribution (PDI values were 0.21, 0.08 and 0.09 for NP1, NP2 and NP3 respectively) (Table 1 ). All the NPs showed negatively surface charge with zeta potential values around −35 mV (Table 1). The morphologies of the CUR-loaded NPs were evaluated by TEM. As shown in Fig. 1 , all the three NPs were in spherical shape with uniform size distribution. The final pH of all the three NPs were 7.2. All the three NPs showed high loading efficiencies, which were 72%, 80% and 90% for NP1, NP2 and NP3 respectively. As designed, the three NPs prepared with different initial CUR feeding amount (0.3, 0.6 and 1 mg) showed different CUR loading levels (11%, 22% and 35% for NP1, NP2 and NP3 respectively) (Table 1)."
14,Comparisons of FNC and bulk mixing,"3.2 Comparisons of FNC and bulk mixing 3.2.1 Mixing sequence The CUR-loaded NPs with different drug loading levels were prepared by different mixing sequences in a small scale (50 µL of each solution). As shown in Table 2 , the mixing sequence significantly affected the particle size of NP2 and NP3. In particular, seq. 2 by mixing CUR and tannic acid first and then adding PVA gave the largest particle size for both NPs. For NP1, the mixing sequence had negligible effect on particle size. NPs prepared by seq. 1 (CUR mixed with PVA first, and then added PVA) showed the similar particle sizes as the NPs prepared by FNC. Thus, seq. 1 was used for the bulk mixing preparation in the following evaluations. 3.2.2 Scalability The scalability of FNC method was investigated and compared with bulk mixing. CUR-loaded NPs at different drug loading levels were prepared using FNC in a large scale (10 mL of each solution). Compared with the NPs prepared in a medium scale (1 mL of each solution), all the three NPs prepared in the large scale showed the same particle size and size distribution (Fig. 2 A). In sharp contrast, when prepared the three NPs via bulk mixing using mixing seq. 1 in a medium scale (1 mL of each solution), precipitations were found in all the three NP solutions (Fig. 2B). 3.2.3 Reproducibility The reproducibility of the FNC method was further investigated. As shown in Fig. 3 A–C, for all the three NPs, no variations were found in the three different batches, indicating good reproducibility of FNC. In contract, for the NPs prepared through bulk mixing in a small scale (50 µL of each solution) using mixing seq. 1, significant batch-to-batch variations were exhibited (Fig. 3D–F). 3.2.4 Stability of CUR-loaded NPs The stability of the CUR-loaded NPs was examined by monitoring the size changes over time. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the particle size of all the three NPs kept stable at least for 5 days at 4 °C. In the presence of 10% FBS, the particle size of all the three NPs slightly increased around 20 nm at the first 6 h, probably due to the protein absorption on the surface of the NPs. After the initial increasement, the size of all the three NPs kept stable over 48 h (Fig. 4B)."
15,In vitro drug release,"3.3 In vitro drug release The in vitro release of the three CUR-loaded NPs was investigated in a simulated physiological environment (PBS, pH 7.4, 37 °C). As shown in Fig. 5 , all the three NPs had similar release profiles, and the release sustained for 48 h. Around 78% CUR were released from the three NPs at 48 h. In addition, no burst release was found for all the three NPs. Around 80% CUR was released from the free CUR over 2 h."
16,Cellular uptake of CUR-loaded NPs,"3.4 Cellular uptake of CUR-loaded NPs The cellular uptake levels were first quantitatively analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 6 , free CUR had higher cellular uptake level than the three CUR-loaded NPs. Intriguingly, we found that the cellular uptake level of the three CUR-loaded NPs was negatively correlated to the drug loading level. NP1 with the lowest drug loading level had the highest cellular uptake level, followed by NP2 with the medium drug loading level, and NP3 with the highest drug loading level. The cellular distribution was further evaluated using confocal microscopy imaging. As shown in Fig. 7 , after treated with free CUR, most of the drugs were accumulated in the nucleus of the cells, while signals were seen in both cytosols and nucleus after treated with the three CUR-loaded NPs. In consistent with the flow study, the fluorescence intensities in the PC3 cells treated with the CUR-loaded NPs followed the same trend: NP1 > NP2 > NP3."
17,Cytotoxicity of CUR-loaded NPs,"3.5 Cytotoxicity of CUR-loaded NPs The cell viability of PC3 cells after treated with free CUR, CUR-loaded NPs and CUR-free NPs were measured using AlamarBlue assay. The IC50 values of free CUR and the three CUR-loaded NPs were calculated according the concentration-response data based on three independent experiments. As shown in Fig. 8 , the IC50 value of NP1 was 7.69 µg/mL, which was close to that of free CUR (9.36 µg/mL), while was significantly lower than those of NP2 and NP3 (18.48 µg/mL and 20.32 µg/mL respectively). No toxicity was observed for CUR-free NPs even at PVA concentration of 100 µg/mL (corresponding CUR concentrations were 50, 100 and 167 µg/mL in NP1, 2 and 3, respectively)."
18,Discussion,"NPs have been extensively used as carriers for the delivery of small molecular drugs. Recently our lab developed a new NP preparation platform termed FNC for the delivery of plasmid DNA, peptide and protein therapeutics in a scalable and reproducible manner (He et al., 2017, 2018; Qiao et al., 2018; Santos et al., 2016). The NPs were formed through ionic interactions between polycations and polyanions via a MIV mixer or a CIJ mixer in a continuous process. In addition, no organic solvent was involved. In this study, we further extended FNC method for the delivery of small molecular drug and explored the potential of using hydrogen bonding interactions as NP forming force. In addition, the effect of drug loading level on cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of NPs were also investigated. A nature anti-cancer compound CUR was used as the model drug. Through rapid mixing of CUR, tannic acid and PVA aqueous solutions with different CUR feeding amount in a three-inlets MIV mixer, three NPs with different CUR loading levels were generated. Given the large number of hydrogen bonding donors and receptors in all the three molecules, the NPs are expected to be forming through hydrogen bonding interactions (Scheme 1). These NPs showed small particle size and narrow size distributions (Fig. 1 and Table 1), indicating that they may have the potential of tumor targeting in vivo due to the EPR effect (Maeda, 2015). The final pH of all the three NPs were 7.2, which is good for in vivo applications. The three NPs had similar particle size, surface charge and the same morphology, which provided an appealing platform to investigate the effect of drug loading level. In particular, no toxic organic solvent was used in the NP preparation process. In laboratory preparation, mixing is normally performed by pipetting, vortexing or stirring. These methods could achieve efficient mixing only in small scale and have the limitation in mixing multiple components simultaneously. It has been shown that the adding sequence significantly affected the physicochemical properties and biological activities of the NPs (Cho et al., 2015). CUR-loaded NPs prepared in three different adding sequences using bulk mixing showed big variations in terms of particle size and size distribution (Table 2). The variations caused by the mixing sequence in bulk mixing could be avoided in FNC method since all the components are mixed rapidly at the same time in a MIV mixer. The conventional mixing methods perform well in small scale preparation for the laboratory research use, while they have limitation in large scale production. Precipitations were found in all three NPs when prepared by bulking mixing through vortexing in a medium scale (1 mL of each solution), indicating poor mixing efficiency of vortexing. In contrast, NPs prepared using FNC in a large scale (10 mL of each solution) showed the same particle size and size distribution as those prepared in a medium scale (1 mL of each solution). In FNC method, digital syringe pumps and MIV mixer were adopted for rapidly mixing of the three components in a controlled manner at flow rate of 10 mL/min, which allows for the continuous and upscaled preparation. Theoretically, 1.14, 1.32 and 1.56 g of NP1, NP2 and NP3 can be generated in 1 h. Multiple devices can be set up parallel for industry production. In addition, severe batch-to-batch variations were found in bulk mixing preparation. NPs prepared using vortexing in a small scale (50 µL of each solution) by adding seq. 1 showed huge size differences in three separated batches, which may be due to the uncontrollable mixing condition of vortexing (Fig. 3). In contract, FNC method showed good reproducibility in three separated experiments (Fig. 3). Collectively, FNC is a more desirable method for NP preparation with excellent scalability and reproductivity compared to bulk mixing. In addition, FNC avoids the variations caused by the different mixing sequences in bulk mixing. The scalability and reproducibility of the FNC method provide the solid foundation for the rapid clinical translation of NPs in the future. Stability is another important parameter that needs to be considered in NP application (Ke et al., 2014a). The CUR-loaded NPs showed good stabilities at 4 °C with or without the presence of FBS (Fig. 4), which indicates these NPs would be stable in storage and may have high stability in blood circulation after systemic administration. The high stability of the NPs probably due to the strong hydrogen bonding interactions within CUR, tannic acid and PVA. All the three NPs showed sustained release over 48 h (Fig. 5). Around 80% CUR was released from free CUR over 2 h, indicating that the diffusion of CUR across the membrane is not a rate-limiting step for NP release. Consistent with other types of NP systems, the cellular uptake of free CUR was higher than those of CUR-loaded NPs (Fig. 6), since free CUR diffused into the cells through passive diffusion while the NPs were internalized by non-specific endocytosis (Xiao et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2014). Most drugs were accumulated in the nucleus after treated with free CUR, while the signals were seen in both nucleus and cytoplasm for the CUR-loaded NP groups (Fig. 7). This occurrence was due to that free CUR can enter the nucleus easily by diffusion, whereas it took time for CUR to be released from the NPs to enter the nucleus. The similar results were also reported by other studies (Ke et al., 2014b; Teo et al., 2017). From both flow cytometry and confocal microscopy studies, we observed that the cellular uptake level was negative correlated with the drug loading level. The enhanced cellular uptake of the NPs with low drug loading level may be due to the fact that those NPs have higher number of NPs than the NPs with high drug loading level at the same dose, which may have higher chance to be internalized by the cells. More mechanism studies are needed in the future. The similar trend was also found in the cytotoxicity study. NP1 with the lowest drug loading level showed the strongest cytotoxicity to PC3 cells than the other two NPs (Fig. 8). The enhanced cytotoxicity presumably due to the higher cellular uptake of NP1 than the other two NPs. These results demonstrated that the drug loading level significantly affect the cytotoxicity of CUR-loaded NPs on PC3 cells. No toxicity was observed for CUR-free NPs, implying that the cytotoxicity of CUR-loaded NPs was solely due to CUR. Although NP1 showed no difference with free CUR in terms of cell killing effect in vitro, it may have higher anti-tumor effect and lower toxicity than free CUR in vivo due to the EPR effect. The anti-tumor effect of the three CUR-loaded NPs with different drug loading levels need to be further investigated in vivo in the future."
19,Conclusions,"In conclusion, a new CUR-loaded NP formulation was successfully prepared through hydrogen bonding interactions using FNC in a scalable and reproducible manner. No toxic organic solvent was involved in this preparation process. Compared to bulk mixing via vortexing, FNC avoided the variations caused by different mixing sequences and different preparation batches and allowed the large-scale preparation. The three CUR-loaded NPs with different drug loading levels had small particle sizes with uniform size distributions, and spherical morphologies. In addition, all the three CUR-loaded NPs were stable at 4 °C with or without the presence of 10% FBS and showed sustained drug release over 48 h. In human prostate cancer PC3 cells, the cellular uptake levels were negatively correlated with the drug loading levels. The results also showed that NP1 with the lowest drug loading level had the strongest anti-proliferation effect among the three NPs. FNC provides an easy and appealing platform for the preparation of small molecular drug loaded NPs by hydrogen bonding interactions. Our findings also demonstrated that the drug loading level significantly affected the cellular uptake and anti-tumor effect of NPs. The in vivo anti-tumor effects of the CUR-loaded NPs need to be further evaluated in the future."
