0,Introduction,"Currently, hydrogen is an important resource as a future alternative energy carrier, and key reactant in chemical reactions for catalytic chemical conversions from natural resources to non-petroleum derived chemicals and bio-fuels [1–4]. So far, hydrogen has been derived from fossil fuels such as natural gas, naphtha, or coal. Approximately 95% of hydrogen is currently produced via steam reforming, a thermal process typically carried out over a nickel-based catalyst; this process involves reacting natural gas or other light hydrocarbons with steam [1,5]. However, this process not only consumes fossil fuels and emits pollutants, but also requires large investments due to the energy-intensive and complicated processes associated with it. Therefore, it is difficult, due to the logistics costs associated with biomass, to build a hydrogen plant that uses biomass as a feedstock in a remote place that will allow for biomass production and collection (e.g. in a tropical rainforest region), despite the fact that such places are typically where chemicals and biofuel plants are located. In these far-off places, the effective methods of producing hydrogen from renewable biomass-derived polyols (e.g. ethylene glycol, glycerol, and sorbitol) and glucose are aqueous phase reforming (APR) [6–8] and steam reforming [9–11]. Steam reforming of polyols has shown good activity for hydrogen generation, but the process requires a high temperature in excess of 500 °C, which means that this is an energy-intensive process [12]. In addition, the process still has insufficient activity to allow low temperature reforming. Compared with steam reforming, the APR process is associated with low-energy consumption and low capital costs for the production of hydrogen due to its relatively mild reaction conditions, its simple single-step process with a high hydrogen yield, and its selectivity without toxic by-products. The APR process has been successfully applied to convert polyols such as EG, glycerol, and sorbitol to hydrogen [5,6]. In these polyols, EG is an interesting feed molecule for studies of APR reactions because it contains the same functionalities of larger polyols, including C–C, C–O, C–H, and O–H bonds, and also OH groups on adjacent carbon atoms [8]. Moreover, EG is the most abundant molecule of compounds derived from the catalytic conversion of cellulose, accounting for more than 70% of cellulose derivatives [10,13]. Among the reaction factors for the APR reaction, catalyst support is one of the most important, pertaining to the activity and selectivity in hydrogen production. Under the high-temperature hydrothermal reaction conditions in an APR, porous carbon materials are considered to be ideal candidates in an aqueous phase reaction due to their remarkable properties, such as their high specific surface area, large pore volume, and chemical and mechanical stability [8,14–16]. Recently, our group found that an ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) CMK-3 supported Pt catalyst was very efficient for producing hydrogen in the APR process [17]. Compared to the support of activated carbon (AC), CMK-3 support is favorable for the transport and diffusion of reactants and products owing to its regular pore arrangement with narrow distribution of pore size [17,18]. In addition, highly dispersed Pt metal particles on the CMK-3 support exhibit better catalytic activity in the APR reaction than that of such particles on AC. However, the Pt/CMK-3 catalyst is associated with aggregation of active Pt metal nanoparticles during the APR reaction. This active metal aggregation can negatively affect the catalytic activity of the APR reaction. In this work, we studied the APR catalytic activity of EG for hydrogen production using four structurally and framework-configurationally different types of OMC supported Pt catalysts. In addition, we elucidate the relationship between the metal sintering and structural aspects of the Pt/OMC catalyst under hydrothermal reaction conditions, specifically an APR reaction."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) and OMC,"2.1 Synthesis of ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) and OMC 2.1.1 Synthesis of OMSs (SBA-15 and KIT-6) Ordered mesoporous silica SBA-15 (2-D hexagonal p6mm structure) and KIT-6 (3-D cubic Ia 3 ¯ d structure) were synthesized according to the recipe reported by Kim et al. [17,19,20]. The prepared SBA-15 and KIT-6 were converted to aluminosilicate form (Al-SBA-15 and Al-KIT-6) by impregnation with an ethanolic solution of AlCl3 (Si/Al = 20). 2.1.2 Synthesis of OMCs A series of OMCs were prepared by a templating synthesis method with furfuryl alcohol as a carbon precursor. Both rod-type ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-3 (2-D hexagonal structure) and CMK-8 (3-D cubic structure) were synthesized by the complete filling of the mesopore channels of Al-SBA-15 and Al-KIT-6 mesoporous silica hard templates, respectively [21]. Briefly, Al-OMSs were filled with furfuryl alcohol as 85% of OMSs total pore volume. The samples containing furfuryl alcohol were placed in an oven at 35 °C for 1 h and then at 100 °C for 1 h. The resultant polymer/silica composite samples were further heated for 2 h at 350 °C. After the samples were cooled to room temperature, the samples were subsequently once more filled with furfuryl alcohol as 55% of Al-OMSs total pore volume and we then carried out drying and heating as in the first case, followed by pyrolysis at 900 °C with a heating rate = 5 °C min−1 with N2 flow for 2 h. The final CMK-3 and CMK-8 were recovered from the silica template, removing them with an aqueous HF/ethanol mixture solution. In contrast, hollow-type OMCs, CMK-5 (2-D hexagonal structure) and CMK-9 (3-D cubic structure) resulted from the incomplete filling of the Al-SBA-15 and Al-KIT-6 mesopores [22,23]. In this procedure, Al-OMSs were filled with furfuryl alcohol as 100% of Al-OMSs total pore volume. The samples containing furfuryl alcohol were dried using a freeze-drying method under vacuum atmosphere. Carbonization of furfuryl alcohol inside the pores of Al-SBA-15 and Al-KIT-6 was carried out at 100 °C for 1 h, followed by pyrolysis under vacuum at 900 °C with a heating rate = 5 °C min−1. Silica templates of prepared CMK-5 and CMK-9 were removed in the same manner as was used for CMK-3 and CMK-8."
3,Preparation of Pt/OMC catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of Pt/OMC catalysts All of the OMC supported 7 wt% Pt catalysts were prepared by a simple incipient wetness method using acetone as a solvent. 1 g of OMC supports were impregnated, by vigorous agitation, with acetone containing hexachloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O, Acros), which accounted for 2 times the OMCs total pore volume. After impregnation, the samples were dried at 35 °C for 1 h followed by 60 °C for 6 h in ambient air to remove acetone. Before the APR reaction, the prepared catalysts were reduced via heating under a hydrogen flow rate of 50 ml min−1. The reduction temperature was linearly increased from room temperature to 260 °C with a heating rate of 1.0 °C min−1 and then maintained at 260 °C for 12 h. The samples were subsequently cooled with a nitrogen flow for 6 h."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Multiplex instrument using Cu-Ka radiation (l = 0.15406 nm), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA (1.6 kW). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken from the thin edges of the particles supported on a porous carbon grid, using a Philips Tecnai G220 device operated at 200 kV. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C on a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 volumetric adsorption analyzer. Before the adsorption measurements, all samples were outgassed at 300 °C in a degassing station. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation was used to calculate the apparent surface area from the adsorption data obtained at P/P 0 between 0.05 and 0.2. The total volume of micro- and mesopores was calculated from the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at P/P 0 = 0.95, assuming that adsorption on the external surface was negligible compared to adsorption in the pores. The pore size distributions (PSDs) were calculated by analyzing the adsorption branch of the N2 sorption isotherm using the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. CO chemisorption was carried out using a BELCAT-B (BEL Japan Inc.). The actual Pt loadings of catalysts were verified by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Spectro Ciros Vision)."
5,Catalytic test,"2.4 Catalytic test Aqueous phase reforming of 10 wt% ethylene glycol was performed in a lab-made fixed bed reactor system. The reactor was made with a 9.5 mm inner diameter and 35.6 cm long stainless steel tube (SS316, contains a maximum of 0.03% carbon, a minimum of 16% chromium, and sufficient nickel and/or manganese) and equipped with up-flow liquid feeding system. The reaction temperature was controlled by a type-K thermocouple (Omega) and PID controller. A liquid feed of 10 wt% ethylene glycol in deionized water was fed into the catalytic reactor at 0.1 ml min−1 with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump. The catalyst (0.3 g) was loaded in the middle of the stainless steel tube and quartz wool was used to fill the length of the reactor. Before performing an aqueous phase reforming reaction, the catalyst went through an H2 reduction step at a 50 ml min−1 flow at 260 °C (heating rate: 1.0 °C min− 1) for 2 h. After reduction, the temperature of the reactor was cooled down to room temperature for removal of the adsorbed H2 gas using N2 as a sweep gas. This reforming reaction was performed with 2.0 h−1 of weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) at 250 °C under 45 atm. The effluent gas products were measured by a gas chromatograph (6100GC, Young Lin Instrument Co.) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 content in the effluent gas were detected by TCD using a packed Carboxen column (3.175 mm id × 4.57 m); hydrocarbons were detected by the FID using a capillary GS-GASPRO column (3.175 mm id × 15 m). The H2 yield, H2 and alkane selectivities, and carbon conversion to gas were calculated from the equations described in the literature [6]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Properties of OMC supports and Pt/OMC catalysts,"3.1 Properties of OMC supports and Pt/OMC catalysts The structures of four different OMCs were analyzed by a series of various characterization techniques, including XRD, N2 physisorption, TEM, and CO chemisorptions analysis. Fig. 1 (a) and (b) gives the low angle XRD patterns of the silica templates (SBA-15 and KIT-6) and corresponding carbon replicas (CMK-3, 5, 8 and 9). In Fig. 1(a), three distinct XRD peaks can be indexed as (100), (110) and (200), and this clearly confirms the successful replication of silica SBA-15 hard template to rod-type CMK-3 [24,25] and hollow-type CMK-5 [26] with the 2-dimensional (2-D) hexagonal space group (p6mm). Fig. 1(b) also shows two and six distinct XRD peaks for rod-type CMK-8 and hollow-type CMK-9 with 3-dimensional (3-D) cubic space group (Ia 3 ¯ d) from the silica KIT-6 hard template. These can be indexed as (211) and (220) for CMK-8, and (211), (220), (321), (400), (420) and (332) for CMK-9. The main peak of (100) and (211) for the SBA-15 and KIT-6 template became very weak on the XRD pattern for hollow-type carbons CMK-5 and CMK-9 due to the diffraction interference between the hollow frameworks [22]. Fig. 1(c) and (d) shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the resultant OMCs. Four different OMCs exhibited the typical type IV curve with sharp capillary condensation steps at relative pressure range P/P 0 = 0.4–0.6. Rod-type CMK-3 and CMK-8 show narrow pore size distribution with an average pore diameter of 3.3 nm and 4.0 nm, respectively. However, hollow-type OMCs, CMK-5 and CMK-9, exhibit bimodal mesopores, as shown in Table 1 . Hollow-type OMC materials are composed of an inner pore of carbon framework and an intra pore between the carbon frameworks [22]. For this reason, hollow-type CMK-5 and CMK-9 carbons show 1.5–1.7 times higher BET surface area than those of rod-type CMK-3 and CMK-8 carbons. Representative TEM images of the four different OMCs are displayed in Fig. 2 . CMK-3 and CMK-5 clearly show a highly ordered mesoporous structure with a mesostructure comprising 2-D parallel porous channels. Fig. 2(c) and (d) shows typical TEM images for the 3-D cubic Ia 3 ¯ d mesoporous structure, and these images also reveal that the CMK-8 and CMK-9 supports are highly ordered 3-D mesoporous structures [20,27]. The detailed structural properties of the OMCs are summarized in Table 1 and the actual Pt loadings and structural properties for each catalyst are also listed. An inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis revealed that the Pt metal was introduced without a significant loss of the Pt. The BET specific surface area and total pore volume of all catalysts showed a slight decrease of about 2–5% due to the increase of the catalyst total mass after the Pt loadings. However, the mesopore sizes of all of the catalyst were identical to those of the OMC supports. It is assumed that highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles formed on the surface of the OMCs without a considerable amount of aggregation. This clearly reveals that the Pt nanoparticles were successfully loaded at a high dispersion on the OMCs support, as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 3 . CO chemisorption analyses were conducted to determine the Pt particle size and metal dispersion of the Pt loaded catalysts with different OMC structures. The sizes of the Pt nanoparticles on the OMC supports from the CO chemisorption analyses were not significantly different. In addition, the Pt particle size was smaller than 2 nm, which corresponds to the TEM observation. In a comparison of the hollow-type and rod-type OMC supports, the values of the metal dispersion of the catalysts using the hollow-type OMC supports (CMK-5 and CMK-9) were found to be larger than those of the catalysts using the rod-type OMC supports (CMK-3 and CMK-8) in view of a framework-configurational perspective. This situation arose because the larger surface area with the additional mesopores of the hollow-type OMC supports leads to greater metal dispersion. Interestingly, both rod-type OMC catalysts (Pt/CMK-3 and Pt/CMK-8) have similar specific BET surface areas, but the metal dispersion of Pt/CMK-8 with the 3-D structure is much higher than that of Pt/CMK-3 with the 2-D structure. This indicates that the metal dispersion of OMC supported Pt catalysts is influenced more by the mesopore structure than by the surface area and that the 3-D mesopore structure may allow for the formation of smaller Pt nanoparticles compared to the 2-D mesopore structure. The highest metal dispersion and CO uptake were observed in the Pt/CMK-9 catalyst due to the synergetic effect of the 3-D pore structure and the high surface area from the hollow-type framework-configuration."
8,Effects of support structure on the APR activity,"3.2 Effects of support structure on the APR activity Four different OMC supported platinum catalysts were used in the APR reaction to investigate the effect of the pore structure and the framework-configuration with a 10 wt% EG aqueous solution. Fig. 4 shows the hydrogen production rate with a time-on-stream of the APR of 10% EG using these 7 wt% Pt/OMC catalysts. All of the catalysts exhibit a fairly constant rate of hydrogen production with the time-on-stream during the overall reaction. This indicates that the OMC supported Pt catalysts are stable overall in the APR reaction without deactivation [17]. The order of the hydrogen production rate among these OMC supported Pt catalysts is Pt/CMK-9 > Pt/CMK-8 > Pt/CMK-5 > Pt/CMK-3. This hydrogen production rate order is similar to that of the metal dispersion order in Table 1, but the hydrogen production rate of Pt/CMK-8 is higher than that of Pt/CMK-5, while the rod-type Pt/CMK-8 has a lower metal dispersion compared to the hollow-type Pt/CMK-5. It appears that the 3-D cubic mesoporous structure has a better effect on the enhancement of the catalytic performance in the APR of the EG than the 2-D hexagonal structure. This also implies that the OMC structural effect is greater than the framework-configuration effect on the APR reaction. Table 2 lists the detailed catalytic performance in the APR of the 10 wt% EG over the Pt/OMC catalysts with different pore structures and framework configurations. In the same structure, the catalysts with the hollow-type framework-configuration (Pt/CMK-5 and Pt/CMK-9) show higher hydrogen yields and lower alkane selectivity compared to the rod-type catalysts (Pt/CMK-3 and Pt/CMK-8, respectively). Besides, in terms of the mesoporous structure, both the CMK-8 and CMK-9 supported Pt catalysts with 3-D cubic Ia 3 ¯ d symmetry show better catalytic performance for hydrogen production and lower alkane selectivity in the APR of 10 wt% EG compared to both the CMK-3 and CMK-5 supported Pt catalysts with 2-D hexagonal p6mm symmetry. For a further investigation of the structural and framework-configurational effects of OMC supported Pt catalysts in the APR reaction, we analyzed the wide-angle XRD patterns of both fresh and spent catalysts and the CO chemisorption rates along with TEM images of the spent catalysts. As can be seen in Fig. 5 , none of the fresh OMC supported catalysts show distinct X-ray diffraction peaks for Pt metal; they only exhibit a diffuse diffraction peak, which provides evidence of their amorphous-carbon-like nature around 2 theta = 23° and 43°. Thus, small and highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles are formed on all of the OMC supports. These results are consistent with the small Pt metal particle sizes and high metal dispersion findings from the CO chemisorption analyses of the fresh catalysts, shown in Table 1. After the APR reaction, three distinct X-ray diffraction peaks for polycrystalline Pt metal appeared in both Pt catalysts using OMC supports with a 2-D hexagonal structure (CMK-3 and CMK-5). This indicates that small platinum nanoparticles in the fresh Pt/CMK-3 and Pt/CMK-5 catalysts become aggregated on the surface of the 2-D hexagonal OMC supports during the APR reaction. However, the 3-D cubic OMC supported Pt catalysts exhibit no distinct or diffuse diffraction peaks for Pt metal. Interestingly, the metal dispersion of the fresh Pt/CMK-5 catalyst is higher than that of the fresh Pt/CMK-8, as shown in Table 1, but the spent Pt/CMK-8 catalyst shows a relatively high metal dispersion compared to the spent Pt/CMK-5 according to the XRD analysis of the Pt(111) diffraction peak. These wide-angle XRD analysis results clearly show that the 3-D pore structure of the OMC support retards metal sintering during a hydrothermal condition of high temperature and high pressure, as in the APR reaction conditions. This low amount of metal aggregation on the 3-D OMC supports during the APR of EG can be attributed to the unique mesostructure of the OMC. The CMK-8 and CMK-9 OMC supports have a 3-D cubic Ia 3 ¯ d mesostructure, which consists of two interpenetrating continuous networks of chiral carbon frameworks. The carbon framework surface follows the gyroid (G-surface) infinite periodic minimal surface (IPMS) precisely [27,28]. This unique 3-D network is thought not only to provide a highly opened porous support that facilitates diffusion throughout the OMC supported catalyst but also to hinder metal nanoparticles from growth and aggregation due to the highly folded surface of the OMC support. On the other hand, CMK-3 and CMK-5 consist of 2-D hexagonally arrayed straight carbon frameworks; their relatively even and flat carbon surface is assumed to permit easier sintering of Pt nanoparticles and then to form larger Pt nanoparticles compared to the 3-D OMC support. From a framework-configurational perspective, hollow-type OMC supported catalysts were less aggregated than rod-type OMC supported catalysts during the APR reaction. This occurred due to the large surface area from the carbon microporosity and the additional mesopores of the hollow-type OMC supports, which also prevent the growth and aggregation of metal nanoparticles [29]. In Fig. 6 , the TEM images of the spent Pt/OMC catalysts clearly show the degree of Pt aggregation after the APR reaction compared to the aggregation of the fresh catalysts, as shown in Fig. 3. This is consistent with the wide-angle XRD results shown in Fig. 5. The detailed Pt particle size results are listed in Table 3 . To validate the assumption of the lower metal aggregation phenomena on the 3-D OMC supports, 10 wt% nickel metal was loaded on the OMC supports using the same incipient wetness impregnation method as was used with Pt/OMC. These Ni/OMC samples with water were put into a hypothetical condition in an autoclave at 250 °C for 24 h; these conditions are similar to the APR reaction conditions. Fig. 7 shows the XRD patterns of the fresh and spent Ni/OMC samples. The fresh Ni/OMC samples do not show distinct diffraction peaks for Ni metal. This indicates that highly dispersed Ni metal particles formed on the OMC supports. However, after the hydrothermal treatment, distinct XRD peaks appeared around 2 theta = 44° and 52°, corresponding to the (111) and (200) diffraction of the polycrystalline Ni metal, respectively [30]. As in the results of the Pt/OMC case, the aggregation of Ni metal nanoparticles was retarded by the 3-D pore structure of the OMC and by the large surface area caused by the hollow-type framework. The Ni metal particle sizes of the spent Ni/OMC samples are listed in Table 4 ."
9,Conclusions,"In conclusion, in contrast to a 2-D rod-type OMC structure, a hollow-type OMC supported Pt catalyst with a 3-D pore structure showed a higher catalytic performance in the APR of EG due to the synergetic effect of the low amount of metal sintering during the reaction process and the more favorable transport and diffusion of the reactants and products. Less metal aggregation on the 3-D pore structure, as demonstrated in this report, may be important in the design and development of new catalysts that are intended to work under severe conditions."
