0,Introduction,"The impending global energy crisis has stimulated extensive research on environmentally friendly, clean, and sustainable energy systems [1–4]. Rechargeable metal-air batteries, renewable fuel cells, and water-splitting batteries as clean energy conversion systems are currently considered as promising environmental protection technology equipment [5–7]. For these sustainable energy systems, ORR/OER/HER are highly significant [8–11]. Efficient electrocatalysts are important in these electrochemical reactions because they improve the energy conversion efficiency and selectivity [12]. So far, Pt-based catalysts are still the most effective HER and ORR electrocatalysts in alkaline media [13,14], while IrO2 and RuO2 have the optimal OER activity [15]. Unfortunately, high cost and poor stability of these noble metals significantly hindered their application in industry [16–18]. More importantly, these single noble metal electrocatalysts cannot simultaneously satisfy both ORR/OER and OER/HER bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in the same alkaline medium at low concentration, or even ORR/OER/HER trifunctional electrocatalytic activity. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop electrocatalytic materials of low-cost and high efficiency with multi-functionality [19–22]. With the development of non-noble catalysts, the materials for ORR/OER/HER are often active and stable at different pH values, which makes it very difficult, sometimes even impossible, to use them for clean energy conversion [23]. The electrocatalytic processes of ORR and OER are more advantageous in alkaline conditions than in acidic conditions due to lower kinetic requirements. On the contrary, the HER electrocatalytic process in acidic conditions is more favorable than that in alkaline conditions. When the ORR/OER/HER three electrocatalytic processes are used in combination, these properties can create major obstacles for design of cheap and efficient trifunctional electrocatalytic materials. Therefore, multi-functional materials that can catalyze ORR/OER/HER at the same time would be very valuable in practices for the sustainable energy system, especially in the alkaline medium. In such case, it can simplify the configuration of a catalytic system and also reduce costs. [24–26]. Molybdenum (Mo)-based and tungsten (W)-based metal carbides are recently used in the field of catalysis due to their abundant reserve in nature, environmental friendly feature, and good catalytic activity [27]. Because of the unique surface structure and d-band electronic characteristics (similar to Pt-group metals), they are considered to be one of the most promising electrocatalytic materials [28,29]. As candidates for ORR/OER/HER, their catalytic activity is extensively studied [30,31]. According to recent reports [32], molybdenum nitride (MoxN) has a relatively weak electrocatalytic activity for HER and ORR in comparison to molybdenum carbide (MoxC), while nitrogen-doped carbon coated MoxN was used as an outstanding electrocatalytic material for HER and OER due largely to a strong coupling effect of two phases [33]. Tungsten nitride (WxN) nanoparticles were used as effective electrocatalytic materials in ORR and OER, while tungsten carbide (WxC) has the electrocatalytic activity for HER [34]. Therefore, the effective construction of electrocatalytic materials with MoxN/MoxC/WxN/WxC heterostructure may produce a synergistic catalytic effect in the electrocatalytic process, which may enhance the electrocatalytic performance for OER, HER, and ORR at the same time. However, due to the harsh conditions of high-temperature calcination, the active nanoparticles inevitably undergo aggregation, and it is difficult to achieve uniform distribution of the nanoparticles in a matrix. Therefore, challenges remain in the synthesis of porous tungsten-molybdenum-based carbon nanocomposite in a controllable manner with uniform distribution of active nanoparticles. As a widely used porous material [35,36], metallic organic framework (MOF) has been applied in electrochemical sensors [37], supercapacitors [38], lithium-ion batteries [39], luminescent materials [40] etc. MOF can provide a convenient synthetic platform for the synthesis of multifunctional materials used in the field of clean energy by using its unique thermal behavior and chemical reactivity [41,42]. In particular, the periodic porous and hybrid structure of MOFs provides unique advantages for synthesizing porous carbon or transition metal-based carbon nanocomposites [43,44]. Although the huge MOFs family covers a wide range of metals, the synthesis of transition metal-based carbon nanomaterials with controllable morphology and functionality using MOFs pyrolysis derivative strategy is still limited to a few transition metals such as Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe [45,46]. Expanding the research to other transition metal-based MOFs-derived carbon nanocomposites will be of great significance. Recently, phosphomolybdic acid hydrate (POM) and phosphotungstic acid hydrate (POW) have been widely used as electrocatalytic materials due to their common redox activity, diversity, and stability [27]. POM and POW were encapsulated into MOFs materials to form corresponding POMOFs, which combines the advantages of tungsten-molybdenum-based heteropoly acid and MOFs materials, and also increase the stability of the framework for the heat treatment. There are few studies on the tungsten-molybdenum-based composites derived from MOFs in the field of electrocatalysis, so there is a need to explore the application potential. In this work, we adopted a simple MOFs encapsulation-assisted synthesis strategy. The guest molecules phosphomolybdic acid hydrate and phosphotungstic acid hydrate were introduced as the precursors into Cu-based MOFs. In combination with a vapor deposition strategy, the volatile nitrogen species from the pyrolysis of dicyandiamide were captured by the nano-octahedral nanoparticles, resulting in the nitriding of tungsten-molybdenum-based oxides and solid carbon, and finally formed the porous MoWN/MoWC@NCTs (T = 700, 800, and 900 °C) nano-octahedral material with unique Mo2N/MoC/W2N/WC heterostructure. These tungsten-molybdenum-based electrocatalysts are difficult to obtain from a single MOF material. At the same time, these non-coordinating POM and POW are also evenly distributed in a closed space and surrounded by organic ligands, hence ensuring a uniform carburizing process and generating the electrocatalytic active sites. The carbonization and nitriding process were restricted in the MOFs-derived nitrogen-carbon matrix, which effectively prevented the agglomeration and loss of active species of tungsten-molybdenum-based nitrogen carbide, to ensure the metals evenly distributed in the ordered structure so that it can fully exert ORR/OER/HER trifunctional electrocatalytic activity. The carbonization temperature and synergy of multi-component heterostructure greatly affect the multifunctional performance of the materials. The most representative MoWN/MoWC@NC800 showed the best ORR/HER/OER trifunctional electrocatalytic activity in 0.1 M KOH electrolytes. The total oxygen electrode activity index ΔE was 0.795 V (vs. RHE), indicating that catalytic activity of OER-ORR was highly efficient and reversible. While in HER, MoWN/MoWC@NC800 showed a minimum potential of −0.17 V (vs. RHE) at a current density of −10 mA cm−2. In comparison to commercial electrocatalytic materials, it has significant advantages. MoWN/MoWC@NC800 also shows excellent cycle stability and durability in the trifunctionally electrocatalytic reaction in the same alkaline medium. To demonstrate its catalytic activity, we built clean energy equipment, a high-performance rechargeable zinc-air battery assembled using MoWN/MoWC@NC800 as the cathode air electrode. The MoWN/MoWC@NC800-based zinc-air battery can afford a higher open circuit potential (1.43 V) and higher power density (86.27 mW cm−2) in comparison to commercial Pt/C-IrO2-base zinc-air batteries. In addition, a self-powered electrochemical integrated water splitting system was used to demonstrate its remarkable multifunctional electrocatalytic properties."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Copper(II) acetate monohydrate ((CH3COO)2Cu·H2O, 99%, Aladdin), dicyandiamide (C2H4N4, 99%, Aladdin), L-glutamic acid (C5H9NO4, 99%, Aladdin), phosphomolybdic acid (H7(P(Mo2O7)6·xH2O, AR, Aladdin), phosphotungstic acid (H3O40PW12·xH2O, AR, Aladdin), 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylic acid (C9H6O6, 99%, Aladdin), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 99.5%, Aladdin), absolute ethyl alcohol (EtOH, 99.5%, Sinopharm) were used as received without further purification."
3,Synthesis of NENU-5-W nano-octahedron,"2.2 Synthesis of NENU-5-W nano-octahedron The NENU-5-W nano-octahedrons were used as the precursor for synthesizing porous MoWN/MoWC@NC nano-octahedrons. According to a previous report [47], the synthesis procedure of NENU-5 is described as follows: 3 mmol copper acetate (II) monohydrate, 1 mmol l-glutamate, 0.45 g phosphotungstic acid hydrate, and 0.75 g phosphomolybdic acid hydrate were added in 120 ml distilled water and stirred continuously at room temperature for 30 min until they were completely dissolved. Then, 2.01 mmol tribenzoic acid was completely dissolved in 120 ml anhydrous ethanol, and then rapidly poured into the above solution at room temperature with continuous stirring. Due to the rapid formation of NENU-5-W nano-octahedral crystal, the mixed solution becomes turbid rapidly. The solution continued stirring for 14 h. The green products were collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol for 3 times. Finally, the products were dried overnight at 60 °C in a vacuum. For comparison, NENU-5 and HKUST-1-W samples were also synthesized with the same method."
4,Synthesis of porous MoOx/WOx@NC nano-octahedrons,"2.3 Synthesis of porous MoOx/WOx@NC nano-octahedrons The NENU-5-W nano-octahedron was transferred to a quartz boat and put in a tube furnace. The temperature in the furnace gradually increased with a rate of 2 °C min−1 under an Ar atmosphere until the temperature reach 650 °C. The temperature was maintained for 6 h, and then cooled to room temperature. During the whole calcination process, Mo and W in the NENU-5-W nano-octahedron were always wrapped in the framework formed by NENU-5 and gradually converted to their oxides. The ligand of NENU-5 was converted to solid carbon, and the formed Cu element needs to be removed. The calcined samples were dispersed in sufficient 0.1 M FeCl3 aqueous solution and stirred continuously for 5 h to ensure the complete removal of Cu elemental in the nanoparticles. The sample was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water several times. Finally, the products were dried overnight at 80 °C in a vacuum to obtain porous MoOx/WOx@NC nano-octahedrons. According to the calcining temperature, the sample was named MoOx/WOx@NC650. In comparison, MoOx@NC650 and WOx@NC650 were respectively prepared with the same procedure."
5,Synthesis of porous MoWN/MoWC@NC nano-octahedrons,"2.4 Synthesis of porous MoWN/MoWC@NC nano-octahedrons Porous MoWN/MoWC@NC nanooctahedron were prepared by calcining dry MoOx/WOx@NC samples. The 0.2 g black porous MoOx/WOx@NC nano-octahedrons and 1 g dicyandiamide were placed on both ends of the quartz porcelain boat and then placed in a tube furnace under an Ar atmosphere. Temperature in the furnace rises at a rate of 5 °C min−1. When temperature reached targeted values (700 °C, 800 °C, and 900 °C), it was kept for 3 h. Throughout the process, the part containing dicyandiamide was always kept at the inlet end. When the temperature of calcination gradually increased, the volatile nitrogen species from the pyrolysis of dicyandiamide were captured by the MoOx/WOx@NC nano-octahedrons, and nitridation of metal oxides and solid carbon occurred, forming the corresponding porous MoWN/MoWC@NC nano-octahedrons. According to the different calcination temperatures (700 °C, 800 °C, and 900 °C), the synthesized porous nano-octahedral materials were marked as MoWN/MoWC@NC700, MoWN/MoWC@NC800, MoWN/MoWC@NC900, respectively. As a control experiment, Mo2N/MoC@NC800 (containing only molybdenum) and W2N/WC@NC800 (containing only tungsten) were also prepared with the same procedure."
6,Results and discussion,"The procedure to prepare the nano-octahedral electrocatalytic material is illustrated in Scheme 1 . The NENU-5-W nano-octahedral precursor was synthesized by using MOFs one-step assisted encapsulation strategy. Guest molecules (phosphotungstate hydrate and phosphomolybdate hydrate) were introduced in the host, HKUST-1, when coordination occurred at ambient temperature through a simple and extensible co-precipitation method. Subsequently, the NENU-5-W nano-octahedron was thermally annealed in an Ar atmosphere at the temperature of 650 °C, and the entire process lasted 6 h. The Cu element in MoOx/WOx-Cu@NC semi-finished products was removed by etching with 0.1 M FeCl3 solution. In combination of vapor deposition strategy, the secondary thermal annealing treatment was performed at different temperatures in the Ar atmosphere. The volatile nitrogen species from the pyrolysis of dicyandiamide were captured by the material, resulting in the nitriding of metal oxides and solid carbon, and yielding porous MoWN/MoWC@NCTs (T = 700, 800, or 900) nano-octahedral materials. We adopted the same preparation method to synthesize the materials for comparison studies. The phase evolution of the porous MoWN/MoWC@NCTs (T = 700, 800, and 900) nano-octahedral materials during the synthesis was characterized by XRD (Fig. 1 a and S1a). The XRD patterns of the precursor (Figure S1a) were consistent with those in the previous study [47]. The XRD results of MoWN/MoWC@NCTs samples is shown in Fig. 1a. After the etching by Fe3+, all the diffraction peaks of the structure consisting of Cu are completely disappeared, and corresponding bimetallic carbonitrides were formed during carbonization and nitridation of dicyandiamide pyrolysis. The diffraction peaks in Fig. 1a correspond well to the crystal phases of different metal carbonitrides, namely Mo2N (JCPDS No. 25–1368), MoC (JCPDS No. 45–1015), W2N (JCPDS No. 25–1257) and WC (JCPDS No. 73–0471). These results indicated that the porous nano-octahedral materials with unique Mo2N/MoC/W2N/WC heterostructures were successfully synthesized by adopting the unique MOFs packaging strategy combined with the vapor deposition strategy. In addition, a broad and weak diffraction peak at 25.4° was attributed to the (0 0 2) crystal plane of graphitic carbon. Meanwhile, when the calcination temperature increases, the diffraction peaks become sharper, indicating that the crystallinity of the electrocatalytic sample increases, which was consistent with many reports in the literature. Raman spectroscopy was used to further analyze the state of the carbon phase in the porous MoWN/MoWC@NCTs and the samples for comparison (Fig. 1b and S1b). All Raman spectrograms have been subjected to peak fitting processing. All the spectrograms showed a D peak and a G peak at 1345 cm−2 and 1586 cm−2, respectively. The D peak represents the Raman characteristic of defects in carbon structure, and the G peak is assigned to the in-plane vibration of sp2 carbon atom [48,49]. The intensity ratio of ID/IG is a good indicator for evaluating the degree of defect and graphitization of carbon-based materials [50]. The results showed that for the series of porous MoWN/MoWC@NCTs the ID/IG values are all greater than 1, meaning that these samples have defects in carbon structure. The ID/IG value is 1.23 for W2N/WC@NC800, 1.25 for Mo2N/MoC@NC800, and 1.28 for MoWN/MoWC@NC800, which indicated that the addition of molybdenum-tungsten bimetallic active components could promoted the carbon structural defects during the synthesis (Table S1). It was worth noting that the MoWN/MoWC@NC800 sample showed relatively high ID/IG value (1.28) in comparison to MoWN/MoWC@NC700 and MoWN/MoWC@NC900, indicating that MoWN/MoWC@NC800 had more structural defect carbons, which was conducive to the generation of uniform distribution of electrocatalytic active sites [51]. The carbon structural defects could be further verified by ESR spectra. ESR was a tool for detecting unpaired electrons in carbon materials [52]. Taking Mo2N/MoC@NC800 and W2N/WC@NC800 samples as references, the ESR spectrum of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 (Fig. 1c) showed the signal obviously enhanced at g = 1.9946, confirmed that the MoWN/MoWC@NC800 sample could promote the formation of carbon structural defects due to the addition of the molybdenum-tungsten bimetallic active components, which further supports the results of the Raman spectra. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the electrocatalytic samples and their precursors prepared at different carbonization temperatures, respectively, confirming the NENU-5-W precursors with octahedral structure with a size of about 900 nm. The porous MoWN/MoWC@NCTs nano-octahedral series samples were obtained after high-temperature synthesis and Fe3+ etching. The SEM image of the corresponding sample was presented in the supporting information (Figure S2). According to the analysis of FESEM image, the octahedral encapsulation structure was well-preserved after the high-temperature treatment and the etching, but the size was reduced, and the surface became slightly rough due to the volatilization of low-boiling components during the pyrolysis process. A large number of pore structures were evenly distributed on the rough surface. In particular, the MoWN/MoWC@NC900 samples have obviously pore structure distribution on the surface, and the octahedral structure may partially collapse due to the higher calcination temperature. By comparison, the MoWN/MoWC@NC800 samples have more intact and uniform octahedral encapsulation structure than the samples prepared at the other temperatures. This unique encapsulation strategy effectively prevented the loss of active substances. Instead, the active substance was evenly distributed in the ordered structure, eventually leading to a uniform encapsulation for metal carbonitride nanocrystals and nitrogen-doped carbon. The internal microstructure of the prepared MoWN/MoWC@NC800 sample was further studied by TEM. The TEM images in Fig. 3 confirm the analysis of SEM results. The MoWN/MoWC@NC800 electrocatalytic sample fully retained the octahedral structure, and clearly showed the nanoporous structure. This nanoporous structure was widely regarded as a positive promoter in electrocatalytic reaction [53]. In Fig. 3a and 3b, each MoWN/MoWC@NC800 porous nano-octahedron was assembled by many uniformly distributed nanocrystals, providing abundant interspace and interconnected channels. In the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 3c and 3d), the lattice fringe with good resolution of the encapsulated nanocrystals could be observed. These nanocrystals were encapsulated in carbon multilayers. Based on the lattice fringes, the interlayer spacing of the carbon layer was about 0.335 nm, which matched with the crystal plane (0 0 2) of graphite carbon. The coated graphitic layer can effectively promote electron transfer, prevent agglomeration of particles, and avoid the corrosion of nanoparticles in an alkaline electrolyte. We also expect that the carbon protection enhances the stability of electrocatalytic materials and thereby produces synergistic effects. The lattice fringes of 0.202 nm and 0.249 nm are the (0 0 4) crystal plane of the Mo2N phase and the (1 0 0) crystal plane of the MoC phase, respectively. The lattice fringes of 0.241 nm and 0.255 nm are the (1 1 1) crystal plane of W2N phase and (1 0 0) crystal plane of WC phase, respectively. The structure analysis of TEM images is consistent with the XRD results, showing that the porous nano-octahedral materials is composite of a unique Mo2N/MoC/W2N/WC heterostructure. TEM-mapping of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 nano-octahedron was performed to obtain the distribution of each element in the samples. In Fig. 3e-l, the element mapping clearly showed the uniform distribution of Mo, N, W, C, and O in the porous nano-octahedral materials. Mo2N/MoC/W2N/WC was uniformly distributed in the MoWN/MoWC@NC800. Coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis was used to confirm the precise element content of the samples before and after 0.1 M FeCl3 solution etching (Table S2). The results show that the Cu element in samples can be mostly removed after the FeCl3 etching. The results are consistent with that of Mo/W theoretical value. The slight error of W and Mo may be the partial loss of metal ions due to the multiple washings of the solvent during the synthesis of the sample. The bonding information of MoWN/MoWC@NCTs (T = 700, 800, and 900) was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Mo2N/MoC@NC800 and W2N/WC@NC800 samples contain only one metal, so they were used as references. XPS results (Figures 4, S3, S4, and S5) showed that the bimetal series electrocatalytic material was a mixture of Mo, W, O, N, and C, which was consistent with the TEM-mapping. The presence of oxygen may be caused by the adsorbed water or oxygen in the air on the surface of the materials during the measurements. The presence of nitrogen on the surface of the samples indicated that the N-doping reaction did occur in the octahedral carbon structure in combination with the vapor deposition strategy of dicyandiamide. For the MoWN/MoWC@NC800 sample, the high-resolution C 1s spectrum was deconvoluted into five peaks: CC (284.7 eV), CN (286.0 eV), COC (287.8 eV), CO (289.7 eV), and O=CO (291.9 eV). The characteristic peak at 286.0 eV corresponds to the binding energy of CN, which further confirmed the existence of the N-doped carbon structure in the sample. In Fig. 4 c, the high-resolution Mo 3d spectrum could be deconvoluted to eight characteristic peaks, Mo0 (228.2 and 231.1 eV), Mo2+ (229.0 and 231.6 eV), Mo4+ (229.9 and 234.0 eV) and Mo6+ (232.3 and 235.4 eV). The characteristic peaks of Mo4+ and Mo6+ indicated the possible presence of unnitrided MoOx species and slight oxidation of the surface during sample preparation [54,55]. In addition, Mo0 may come from the outer carbon shell, which could effectively stabilize the entire octahedral structure. At the same time, the high-resolution W 4f spectrum was deconvoluted to four characteristic peaks (Fig. 4d). The binding energies of 32.0 eV and 34.1 eV correspond to W-C species, while the binding energies of 35.4 eV and 37.3 eV are assigned to W-N species. The above results confirmed that the molybdenum-tungsten-based active species were successfully encapsulated in the octahedral structure using the encapsulation strategy. The introduction of volatile nitrogen species from the pyrolysis of dicyandiamide into the nanooctahedral structure was the key step of introducing nitrogen source by using the vapor deposition strategy. The six characteristic peaks shown in the fitting of N 1 s spectrum were Mo-N (394.5–395.5 eV), W-N (395.8–397.8 eV), pyridine-N (398.1–399.1 eV), pyrrole-N (399.2–400.4 eV), graphite-N (401.2–402.8 eV) and oxidation-N (403.2–407.1 eV), respectively. The existence of different N species further provided compelling evidence for the integration of N in the octahedral carbon framework. According to relevant reports [56,57], metal-N and pyridine-N could promote the electrocatalytic reaction by weakening the energy barrier for gas molecule adsorption on adjacent carbon atoms, while, the presence of graphite-N helps to improve the conductivity of the composite materials [58,59]. The combination of pyridine-N, metal-N, and graphite-N plays a synergistic role and jointly promotes the electrocatalytic reaction process. With the uniform carburizing reaction process and the tungsten-molybdenum-based nitrogen carbide active species generated during the carbonization and nitriding process, which could more fully played its mulifunctional electrocatalytic activity. The influence of different temperatures in vapor deposition strategy was studied when generating nitrogen-bonded active species. By calculating the peak area of the N 1 s spectrum of the sample, the relative proportions of various N species in the porous MoWN/MoWC@NCT samples could be estimated. The results are listed in Table S1 and in Fig. 4a. With the increase of calcination temperature, the content of graphite-N in the samples gradually increased, which was caused by the thermal instability of pyridine-N, metal-N, and pyrrole-N under high-temperature conditions, which were all easily converted into graphite-N. Different calcination temperatures have great influence on the formation of various N bonding types. The MoWN/MoWC@NC800 provided the optimal composition with the contents of Mo-N (26.88%), W-N (17.45%), pyridine-N (25.36%) and graphite-N (14.66%), which showed excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activity (see the catalytic results in the next section). The specific surface area and pore size distribution of MoWN/MoWC@NCTs were characterized by BET measurement technique. Fig. 5 a and 5b showed the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the pore diameter distribution. The comparative samples Mo2N/MoC@NC800 and W2N/WC@NC800 were also characterized in the same conditions (Figure S6). The specific surface area of all samples was shown in Table S1. The order of the specific surface area was in the following order: MoWN/MoWC@NC800 (151.72 m2 g−1) > MoWN/MoWC@NC700 (98.68 m2 g−1) > MoWN/MoWC@NC900 (135.45 m2 g−1). Obviously, the MoWN/MoWC@NC800 sample has the largest specific surface area, indicating that more electrocatalytic active sites were exposed. We also used the BJH method to investigate the porosity of the MoWN/MoWC@NCT samples and found that the pore size is mostly in the mesoporous range (about 10–50 nm). The characteristic porous structure of the Cu-based MOFs precursor and the presence of graphitic carbon contributed to the rich porous structure of the MoWN/MoWC@NC800 sample. In comparison to other samples, MoWN/MoWC@NC800 has the most abundant mesoporous structure, which could provide more channels for mass transfer of ORR/OER/HER and fast access to electrocatalytic active sites. The ORR/HER/OER electrocatalytic performance of the prepared samples was evaluated in 0.1 M KOH saturated with oxygen or argon using a typical three-electrode system. Electrochemical tests showed that the porous MoWN/MoWC@NCTs had excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activity in the same low-concentration alkaline electrolyte. For comparison, commercial Pt/C, RuO2, Mo2N/MoC@NC800, W2N/WC@NC800, MoOx/WOx@NC800, MoOx@NC800, and WOx@NC800 were used as references (Table S3, Table S4). First, the ORR activity of porous MoWN/MoWC@NCTs samples were evaluated. Figure S7 showed the CV curves of the samples, which were measured in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution saturated with Ar and O2. No redox peak was found in Ar saturated KOH electrolyte solution, but the ORR activity peak was shown the in O2-saturated KOH electrolyte solution, which confirmed the effective catalytic activity of MoWN/MoWC@NCTs in ORR. In comparison to MoWN/MoWC@NC700 and MoWN/MoWC@NC900 and other samples, MoWN/MoWC@NC800 showed a higher ORR activity peak in the CV curves, meanin that MoWN/MoWC@NC800 had excellent ORR electrocatalytic performance. The electrocatalytic performance of the materials that are calcinated at different temperatures was studied. The RDE measurements of all samples were performed at a scanning rate of 5 mV s−1 in an O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. In Fig. 6 a and 6 g, we compared the linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) measurements for MoWN/MoWC@NC700 (0.865 V, 0.785 V vs. RHE) and MoWN/MoWC@NC900 (0.871 V, 0.790 V vs. RHE) and MoWN/MoWC@NC800 (0.890 V, 0.815 V vs. RHE). MoWN/MoWC@NC800 showed the best initial potential and half-wave potential, which were closer to the values of commercial Pt/C (0.915 V, 0.820 V vs. RHE). Consistent with CV results. MoWN/MoWC@NC800 exhibits a limiting current density of 6.78 mA cm−2, which far exceeded commercial Pt/C and the other samples (Fig. 6a and S12b). In order to explore the electron transfer number (n) and reaction path of the MoWN/MoWC@NCT samples during ORR reaction, the polarization curves (Fig. 6b, S8a, and S8c) were recorded at different rotational speeds (400–2025 rpm). When the speed gradually increased, the limiting current density also increased, which could be attributed to the features of shortening the diffusion distance at high speed [60]. The corresponding electron transfer number (n) could be calculated according to the polarization curve and K-L equation at different potentials. In Fig. 6c, S8b, and S8d, all K-L curves of MoWN/MoWC@NCTs showed good linearity and nearly parallel at different potentials. These results imply that the reaction follows the first-order kinetics. The calculated average electron transfer number was close to 4.0, indicating that the electrocatalytic process of ORR for the MoWN/MoWC@NCT samples was a four-electron reaction pathway, and it was verified by the main product, water. To accurately verified the electron transfer number and product selectivity of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 in the ORR reaction process, a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) LSV measurement was performed in the same medium at 1600 rpm (Fig. 6h). The disk current (Id) and ring current (Ir) obtained from the RRDE measurement could accurately estimate n and the H2O2 yield (%). The result was shown in Fig. 6i. The average value of n for MoWN/MoWC@NC800 was close to 4.00 within the potential range, and the yield of H2O2 was between 0 and 5%, indicating that the ORR electrocatalysis by MoWN/MoWC@NCTs was dominated by the 4e- reduction pathway, which verified the analysis results of the K-L equation. Furthermore, a Tafel diagram was plotted based on the LSV curves obtained by different samples at 1600 rpm. The ORR kinetics of different samples was evaluated by using the Tafel slopes. In Fig. 6d, the Tafel slopes of the MoWN/MoWC@NCTs (T = 700, 800 and 900) were 71, 60, and 62 mV dec-1, respectively, which were all lower than the slope of Pt/C (88 mV dec-1). The smallest Tafel slope was found for MoWN/MoWC@NC800 sample, indicating the fastest ORR dynamics. The durability and stability of electrocatalytic materials were important factors for ORR electrocatalysis. The results of the chronoamperometry for MoWN/MoWC@NC800 and Pt/C were shown in Fig. 6f at the potential of 0.665 V (vs. RHE). After 18000 s of continuous reaction, the relative current of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 was 94.78% of the original current density, whereas the value for Pt/C decayed to 51.98%. The results showed that MoWN/MoWC@NC800 has better stability and durability than the commercial catalytic materials. Methanol resistance is another important parameter for electrocatalytic materials in ORR. The chronoamperometry was used to investigate the methanol tolerance of the MoWN/MoWC@NC800 in 0.1 M KOH medium. In Fig. 6e, the anti-methanol performance for MoWN/MoWC@NC800 and Pt/C was significantly different. The commercial Pt/C was vulnerable to methanol poisoning, when a certain amount of methanol was injected into the alkaline medium after 400 s. The instantaneous current density showed a sharp change, while the MoWN/MoWC@NC800, in the same conditions, showed no significant change in current density, indicating that MoWN/MoWC@NC800 has excellent methanol tolerance and more advantageous in practical applications. The ORR electrocatalytic activity of all test samples is summarized in Table S3 and Table S4. In the same condition, the OER polarization curve was recorded for the MoWN/MoWC@NCT samples, and the OER activity for the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalyst were used for comparison. Fig. 7 a and S12c showed the polarization curves from 0.1 to 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Surprisingly, the OER activity of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 even exceeded that of the commercial RuO2 catalyst (inset of Fig. 7a). The working voltage of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 was 1.61 V, which is lower than that of MoWN/MoWC@NC700 (1.68 V), MoWN/MoWC@NC900 (1.63 V), and commercial RuO2 (1.62 V). The OER electrocatalytic activity of the commercial Pt/C was negligible. In addition, the Tafel diagram (Fig. 7b) was derived from the corresponding LSV curve. The Tafel slopes for MoWN/MoWC@NC700, MoWN/MoWC@NC800, MoWN/MoWC@NC900, and commercial RuO2 were 128, 90, 104, and 155 mV dec-1, respectively. MoWN/MoWC@NC800 has the smallest Tafel slope, meaning that it has the fastest reaction rate in the OER process. Electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was important criteria for the electrocatalytic activity of OER. The CV curves of the MoWN/MoWC@NCT samples in the non-faraday region were recorded at different scanning speeds (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mV s−1). The test potential range was in the range of 1.165–1.215 V (vs. RHE). In Fig. 7c, 7d, and S9, the Cdl could be calculated through the CV curves of different samples. The Cdl of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 was 21.8 mF cm−2, which was higher than that of MoWN/MoWC@NC700 (6.02 mF cm−2) and MoWN/MoWC@NC900 (13.5 mF cm−2). MoWN/MoWC@NC800 has higher capacitance and greater electrochemically active surface area than the other two materials. These features are conducive to the OER electrocatalytic reaction process. The above results could be explained by the specific surface area in the BET measurements, because larger specific surface area indicates that more electrochemical active sites are exposed to reactants. The EIS measurements were performed to analyze the electrode dynamics and impedance of the series electrocatalytic materials. The Nyquist diagram (Fig. 7e) showed that semicircular radius (Rct) of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 (58.97 Ω) was smaller than that of MoWN/MoWC@NC700 (91.57 Ω) and MoWN/MoWC@NC900 (72.71 Ω), indicating that MoWN/MoWC@NC800 had a smaller charge transfer resistance and better electrical conductivity. In addition to higher activity, electrocatalytic stability and durability were also key parameters for the OER performance of electrocatalytic materials. In the same electrolyte, the MoWN/MoWC@NCTs were subjected to a continuous potential cycle up to 1000 cycles between 1.0 and 1.5 V (vs. RHE). Fig. 7f and S10 showed the LSV polarization curves before and after 1000 cycles, respectively. There was almost no difference between the two LSV polarization curves for MoWN/MoWC@NC800. The two LSV polarization curves for MoWN/MoWC@NC700 and MoWN/MoWC@NC900 showed a clear decay. In addition, the OER durability of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 sample was evaluated by chronoamperometry in the same electrolyte. In the inset of Fig. 7f, the current density remained around 10 mA cm−2 during 18000 s. There was a slight decrease, which may be because the oxygen bubbles were not discharged in time, causing the reduction of the contact surface between the catalyst and the reactant. The above results mean that the MoWN/MoWC@NC800 has excellent OER stability and durability. The electrocatalytic activity of OER for all test samples is summarized in Table S3 and Table S4. Fig. 8 shows the results of LSV for the samples in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution. MoWN/MoWC@NC800 showed excellent bidirectional activity in ORR and OER, which was evaluated by the potential difference (ΔE) between the OER potential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and the ORR half-wave potential (E1/2) (ΔE = Ej=10, OER–E1/2, ORR), where ΔE was reversible overvoltage. For MoWN/MoWC@NC800, the ΔE value was 0.795 V, but for the MoWN/MoWC@NC700 and MoWN/MoWC@NC900, the ΔEs were 0.895 V and 0.84 V, respectively. When the electrocatalytic materials are used as a reversible oxygen electrode, a smaller ΔE indicates lower efficiency loss and better oxygen electrocatalytic activity [61]. The low ΔE value of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 indicates its excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in alkaline medium with low concentration. Moreover, in comparison to the relevant non-precious metal bifunctional and trifunctional electrocatalysts, the ΔE value of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 had a more obvious advantage. A comparison of the results are listed in Tables S3, S4, and S5. Undoubtedly, due to the higher ORR/OER activity of MoWN/MoWC@NC800, we expect that the material can be an excellent candidate for zinc-air batteries. In order to verify its trifunctional electrocatalytic activity, the HER electrocatalytic performance of MoWN/MoWC@NCT samples were evaluated in the same alkaline medium (0.1 M KOH) using commercial Pt/C as the reference. LSV polarization curves of all the samples were recorded under the scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and the current density of −10 mA cm−2 (in Fig. 9 a, 9c, and S12d). In comparison to the MoWN/MoWC@NC700 (-0.26 V vs. RHE), MoWN/MoWC@NC900 (-0.21 V vs. RHE) and the other samples, MoWN/MoWC@NC800 showed a lower overpotential (-0.17 V vs. RHE), only slightly higher than commercial Pt/C. In comparison to other reported electrocatalytic materials for HER, the electrocatalytic activity of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 exhibited a obvious advantage in 0.1 M KOH. Fig. 9b was the Tafel diagram based on the results of steady-state polarization measurement, which is to reveal the HER activity of the MoWN/MoWC@NCTs (T = 700, 800, and 900) regarding dynamics. The Tafel slope for MoWN/MoWC@NC800 was about 73 dec-1. Although this value was slightly higher than the 59 mV dec-1 for the commercial Pt/C catalyst, it was much smaller than the values for MoWN/MoWC@NC700 (121 mV dec-1) and MoWN/MoWC@NC900 (93 mV dec-1). These results indicated that MoWN/MoWC@NC800 had good reaction kinetics in HER. In addition to the remarkable electrocatalytic activity in HER, MoWN/MoWC@NC800 also showed excellent stability and long-term durability in low-concentration alkaline media (0.1 M KOH). The HER stability and durability of electrocatalytic samples are also key features in sustainable energy systems. Fig. 9d and S11 showed the polarization curves of the MoWN/MoWC@NCTs before and after the HER stability test, respectively. After 1000 times of accelerated linear potential scanning at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1, the two polarization curves presented by MoWN/MoWC@NC800 remained unchanged, confirming its excellent HER stability in alkaline media. Obvious decay was found in the LSV polarization curves of MoWN/MoWC@NC700 and MoWN/MoWC@NC900 before and after the cycle. This decay means that the alkaline electrolyte had slight corrodes the electrocatalytic material. Moreover, when the electrocatalyst was rotating at a high speed, the loss of the materials on the electrode surface is also an influential factor leading to the decrease of electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, in the same test conditions, the long-term HER durability of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 with constant electric potential was studied by chronoamperometry. In the inset of Fig. 9d, the i-t curve showed only a slight current attenuation within 17000 s, which further confirmed its excellent long-term durability of HER. The HER electrocatalytic activity of all test samples is summarized in Table S3. The excellent multifunctional electrocatalytic activity has encouraged us to construct a rechargeable zinc-air battery with MoWN/MoWC@NC800 and drove the electrocatalytic water-splitting in a self-powered manner, to expand its potential value. Fig. 10 a showed a schematic diagram of the device. Carbon paper coated with MoWN/MoWC@NC800 was used as the cathode, and a polished Zn plate was used as the anode. The battery used 6 M KOH aqueous solution with 0.2 M ZnO as the electrolyte to assemble the rechargeable Zn-air battery. Fig. 10b showed that the assembled Zn-air battery can provide a high open circuit potential of 1.43 V, indicating the excellent electrocatalytic property of MoWN/MoWC@NC800. We also assembled Zn-air battery with commercial Pt/C-IrO2 as cathodic material in the same construction. Fig. 10d showed the charge–discharge polarization curves of the Zn-air battery with these two cathodic materials. In comparison to commercial Pt/C-IrO2, the MoWN/MoWC@NC800 as the cathode material reduced charge–discharge voltage gap. This resulted implied that the Zn-air battery made by MoWN/MoWC@NC800 delivered an outstanding catalytic property in OER/ORR. In addition, Fig. 10e showed the discharge curve and power density curve of the Zn-air battery equipped with MoWN/MoWC@NC800 and commercial Pt/C-IrO2. The results showed that MoWN/MoWC@NC800 had a better power density (86.27 mW cm−2) compared to commercial Pt/C-IrO2 (73.85 mW cm−2). To study the cycling stability of the rechargeable zinc-air battery, a current discharge/charge test was conducted at the current density of 5 mA cm−2. In Fig. 10f, MoWN/MoWC@NC800 showed a smaller charge/discharge voltage gap than commercial Pt/C-IrO2, which further confirms that the zinc-air battery made of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 has high cycle stability. To display the potential application of the trifunctional material in a self-powered water splitting system, we used MoWN/MoWC@NC800 for both anode and cathode of double electrode separation device to study the overall separation performance of water in 0.1 M KOH. Two rechargeable zinc-air batteries connected in series with a water-splitting device (Fig. 10c). A large number of O2 and H2 bubbles could be observed from the two electrodes, indicating the successful and efficient operation of the self-powered system."
7,Conclusion,"In summary, a simple MOFs encapsulation-assisted synthetic strategy was used to prepare MoWN/MoWC@NCTs (T = 700, 800, and 900). The excellent electrocatalytic activity was attributed to the unique Mo2N/MoC/W2N/WC hetero-material with porous nano-octahedral structure. The synergic effect of the different active components depended on the encapsulation and in-situ carbonization of the Cu-based MOFs (NENU-5). This encapsulation and vapor deposition strategy effectively prevented the loss of active substances, and also ensure the even distribution of active sites in the ordered structure. The porous MoWN/MoWC@NCT samples had excellent ORR/OER/HER trifunctional electrocatalytic activity in the same low-concentration alkaline medium (0.1 M KOH). The carbonization temperature and multi-component synergistic effectly greatly affected the ORR/HER/OER performance of the prepared porous MoWN/MoWC@NCTs materials. MoWN/MoWC@NC800 was the most representative material in the series, which has significant advantages in comparison to other reported non-noble metal electrocatalytic materials and commercial electrocatalytic materials. The total oxygen electrode activity index ΔE of MoWN/MoWC@NC800 in ORR and OER was 0.795 V (vs. RHE). In the HER conditions, MoWN/MoWC@NC800 showed to a minimum potential of −0.17 V (vs. RHE) at a current density of −10 mA cm−2. A high-performance zinc-air battery was constructed, which provided a high open circuit potential of 1.43 V with good stability and long cycle life. It meets the energy requirement for driving electrocatalytic water-splitting in a self-powered manner. The device could stably generate hydrogen and oxygen under normal conditions."
