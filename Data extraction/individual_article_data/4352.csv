0,Introduction,"Hydrogen with a large chemical energy of ∼143 MJ kg−1 is a clean fuel that could produce in various ways [1,2]. So, separating hydrogen has become the priority of research centers around the world. According to recent findings, hydrogen separation methods are in progress. However, methods for hydrogen storage are on the path to economic evaluation and need to further development. Various practical methods based on liquefaction in cryogenic temperature, compression in wide temperature ranges, chemical and physical adsorption has evaluated so far [3–5]. Among these methods, physical adsorption preferred to other methods due to the fast reversibility which makes the application easy in a wide pressure range and over many pressure swing cycles. But, a working temperature, especially near the liquid nitrogen, needs to achieve higher storage capacities. So, a cryogenic insulation of the reservoir is necessary [6]. According to all the items, the main problem of hydrogen application for storage is finding materials that can store hydrogen efficiently. Among the materials used for hydrogen storage, Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have widely used in the last two decades. MOFs prepare by reaction of metal ions and organic linkers [7,8]. Because of the intrinsic large surface area and tunable pore size [9], MOFs become suitable for applications such as gas storage and separation [5], catalysis [10], sensors [11], and separation of isotopes such as hydrogen and deuterium [12]. However, sensitivity in contact with moisture, decomposition in long-term subjected to air, instability under high temperatures and pore deformations at higher pressures are still some of the main technical problems to their development in any applications [13,14]. To improving defects, MOFs could combine with materials that have better physical and chemical properties. So, graphene oxide (GO) may improve the poor surface and durability features of most MOFs, which exclude them from using as gas storage materials. GO is a smart matter with epoxy, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on its surface [15]. Also, GO could use as pillar connectors for MOFs. GO expected to bring three advantages. First, it can provide a large contact area for the growth of MOF to produce the MOF@rGO composites. Second, it can adjust the morphology and surface porosity of MOF and improve the H2 adsorption performance in both thermodynamic and kinetic ways. Third, the good dispersion of GO sheets can increase the surface water-resistance of the composites and hinder water molecules to diffuse in MOF particles. Fourth, GO increase the production yield of adsorbent. Generally, solvothermal batch reactions used for MOFs preparation. In this method, the reactants dissolved in a solvent and heated to a high temperature for needed time [16]. So, preparing MOFs by solvothermal method hindered its application in industries owing to high production time and cost. Also, the conventional heating decreases the synthesis yield of MOF with fine crystallinity due to the formation of metal oxide at high reaction time. So, researchers tried to reduce the time and cost of production of MOFs to be suitable for industrial applications. Microwave (MW) heating has recently applied as an effective method for preparation of MOFs at the laboratory scale. Microwave heating decreases the synthesis time down to minutes or seconds, increases the crystal size uniformity, and declines the energy consumption compared to conventional methods [17–19]. The benefits of MW heating and continuous-flow (CF) processing have used for the synthesis of some MOFs, such as MOF-74, MOF-5, and Cu-MOF [20–22]. There is brief knowledge about the MW synthesis of MOFs versus the conventional method, so the average temperature as a key property used for explanations [23]. Further, there is little knowledge about features that are important for continuous synthesis. So, flow in the channel will use as a key feature for description. Effects of MW irradiation on the fluid in the microchannel depends on the solvent dielectric constant, the power density of solvent and penetration depth of MW irradiation in the channel [24]. In theory, MW synthesis could uniformly convert the MW irradiation into heat, which offers the heating is independent to reaction vessel volume [25]. However, MW radiation has a limited penetration depth into the mixtures that principally limits the size of the reaction media. When magnetron lamp radiation cannot penetrate throw the chamber of the reaction mixture, heat would transfer to other parts of the reaction media via convection. So, the benefits of MW heating would loss [26]. To overcome these obstacles, we propose to combine MW heating and microfluidics for the fast and effective synthesis of MOF@rGO composites. MW-assisted microfluidic presents some processing advantages such as intensification of heat transfer, lower molecular diffusion distance, small reactor volumes, low inventory, fast synthesis, possibility of scale out and industrialization. Furthermore, this method enhances the safety of a process compared to conventional heating and batch MW heating when working with a flammable solvent. In this research, we report a fast and continuous synthesis of MOF@rGO composite throw a MW-assisted microfluidic channel in two routes. So, Cu-BDC applied as prototype MOF to explore the effect of synthesis methods on hydrogen adsorption. Also, the effect of synthesis conditions (GO concentration, metal/linker molar ratio and MW time) on the composite material properties carefully examined by response surface method (Box-Behnken Design). Pure and composite MOF characterized by TEM, FTIR, TGA, EDX, and SEM. The pure and composites MOF then applied for hydrogen adsorption evaluation."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Copper (II) nitrate hydrate (Cu (NO3)2.3H2O), 1, 4-benzene dicarboxylic acid (H2BDC), urine, acetone, and dimethylformamide (DMF), was bought from Aldrich and used without further purifications. Famous polar solvents such as water, alcohols, ketone, and acid differently interact with MW, depending on their polarity. Among these solvents, DMF interact well with MW and reach higher temperatures in a short time interval owing to its loss tangent about 0.161 [27]. So, DMF selected for synthesis process. It should be noted that non-polar solvents are transparent to MW irradiation and their temperature would not increase exposed to MW. Graphene oxide with a significant BET specific surface area of about 250 m2 g−1 prepared based on our previous work [28]."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods Three different synthesis setups namely a conventional heating, one stage MW-assisted microfluidic, and two stages MW-assisted microfluidic were used in this research. The schemas of MW-assisted setups are presented in Fig. 1 . The conventional heating system contains an oil bath, a blue cap bottle (the reaction media with the volume of 50 ml), a thermometer, and a heater stirrer. The one stage MW-assisted microfluidic system (Fig. 1B) contains two syringe pumps, a multimode MW system, and specific amount of PTFE tube as transfer line and reaction media (10 cm of PTFE tube with ID = 500 μm and OD = 1.1 mm was exposed to MW). The two stages MW-assisted microfluidic system (Fig. 1A) consist of four syringe pumps, a multimode MW system, and a specific amount of PTFE tube as transfer line and reaction media (10 cm of PTFE tube with ID = 500 μm and OD = 1.1 mm was exposed to MW). The reactor volume in MW-assisted microfluidic systems was equal to 0.2 μl. All the MOF and MOF@rGO were prepared by these setups. It is worth noting that the temperature of the conventional heating method and the temperature of outlet solutions in MW-assisted microfluidic systems were selected as the controlling parameter for further comparison."
4,Synthesis of Cu-BDC,"2.3 Synthesis of Cu-BDC To prepare the Cu-BDC MOF, Copper (II) nitrate hydrate (Cu(NO3)2.3H2O) (2 g) and 1,4-benzene dicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) (2 g) dissolved in 100 ml of DMF in separate blue cap bottles. In the next step, both solutions were homogenized by 10 min sonication. Then, the solutions were injected by two syringe pumps through the PTFE tube and mixed by each other before entering the microwave chamber. In continue, the residence time of reactants was adjusted between five and fifteen seconds by controlled injection rate. Hereafter, the solution was centrifuged to separate the solids from the suspension. Then, the blue solids were washed three times with pure DMF and acetone for 12 h. The samples have dried and activated in 180 °C for 12 hours. Also, Cu-BDC was prepared throw conventional heating method with the same precursors in a blue cap bottle with 200 ml volume at 100 °C. The obtained blue crystals were washed in the same manner."
5,Synthesis of Cu-BDC@rGO,"2.4 Synthesis of Cu-BDC@rGO The Cu-BDC@rGO has prepared in two routes. In addition to the two solutions that explained in the previous section, the specific amount of GO was added to 100 ml DMF and completely dispersed by 1 hour stirring and 30 minutes sonication. Also, a solution contains 2.4 g of urea in 20 ml DMF was prepared. So, in the first route (two stages), GO, Cu and urea solutions were mixed and exposed to microwave with the power of 170 W for adjusted time. So, GO was reduced to graphene nanosheets and Cu anchored on the graphene nanosheets. In the following, the solution contains H2BDC and first stage products were mixed and exposed to microwave for another adjusted time. The prepared composite namely Cu-BDC@rGO-R1 filtered and washed 3 times with pure DMF and acetone for 12 h. Finally, the samples have dried and activated in 180 °C for 12 hours. Schema of the synthesis set up presented in Fig. 1A. In the second route (one stage), solutions of GO, Cu, urine, and H2BDC simultaneously mixed and exposed to microwave with the power of 170 W for adjusted time. The prepared composite namely Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 filtered and washed 3 times with pure DMF and acetone for 12 h."
6,Material characterization,"2.5 Material characterization 2.5.1 XRD analysis XRD pattern used to characterize the crystallinity of the materials. The evaluations carried out at ambient temperature using a Bruker device in the 2θ range 2°–60° at a scan speed of 0.1° s−1 using CuKa radiation. 2.5.2 TEM and SEM analysis Crystal shape and size of Cu-BDC, and Cu-BDC@rGO adsorbents evaluated using Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). 2.5.3 TGA analysis The thermal stability of Cu-BDC, Cu-BDC@rGO-R1 and Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 materials examined by thermogravimetric analysis using SANAF TGA-DSC (IRAN) equipment. The specific amount of samples heated from 300 K up to 950 K at a rate of 10 K min−1 under a laminar flow of nitrogen (20 ml min−1). 2.5.4 BET analysis Surface features (specific surface areas, pore volumes and mean pore size) of the materials calculated by volumetric apparatus. The BET method is based on N2 adsorption isotherms between 0.05–0.5 relative pressures. Before measurements, the adsorbents activated by heating up to 453 K under vacuum condition for 24 h using the special unit. This process leads to remove any water molecules, solvent molecules and gas molecules from the pores. The BJH method used to calculate the pore size distributions base on the adsorption data of the isotherms [29]."
7,Hydrogen adsorption measurements,"2.6 Hydrogen adsorption measurements Hydrogen adsorption measured at 298 K and 77 K up to 40 bar by ADs.co volumetric apparatus (Laboratory instrument, IRAN). This apparatus uses three pressure indicators and sensors (0–40, 0-600, -1-10 bar) and one vacuum gauge. The temperature adjusted by liquid nitrogen and airflow in an aluminum coil around the adsorption cell with an accuracy of 0.5 K in the range of 77-300 K. For adsorption, 1 g of MOF placed in a copper cell and activated at 453 K under vacuum condition for 2 hours (vacuum equal to 10−3 mbar). The dead zone of the adsorption cell measured by inert and rigid materials like silica powder having the same volume (nsilica (p, T)) under the same conditions [30]. For adsorption experiments, the reservoir at first filled with hydrogen to a predefined pressure before injected into the adsorption cell containing the sample. Supposed the equilibrium reached when the pressure and temperature changes were below the thresholds. From the mass balance and using Tsonopolous correction, the excess hydrogen adsorption can calculate. (1) n e x c = n exp − n s i l i c a Excess adsorption can’t provide a complete and accurate description for gas absorption. So the new amount would need to evaluate the adsorption. To estimate this value, the volume of the adsorbed layer (Vads) needs to specify. So Vads is close to: (2) V a d s = n e x c ⋅ M H 2 ρ l q where MH2 is the molecular weight of hydrogen equal to 2.016 g mol−1 and ρlq is the density of the adsorbed layer equal to a density of the liquefied gas. This value (ngas) could calculate by the following equation: (3) n g a s = P ⋅ V a d s Z ⋅ R ⋅ T compressibility factor (Z) could calculate using the famous Tsonopolous correction for non-ideal gas; (4) Z = 1 + B p R T (5) B P c R T c = F 0 T r + ω • F 1 T r (6) F 0 T r = 0.1445 − 0.33 T r − 0.1385 T r 2 − 0.0121 T r 3 − 0.000607 T r 8 (7) F 1 T r = 0.0637 + 0.331 T r 2 − 0.423 T r 3 − 0.008 T r 8 where F° and F1 are Tsonopolous parameters dependent to T r = T T c and ω is the acentric factor of hydrogen equal to -0.22. Finally, the nabs are [30]: (8) n a b s = n g a s + n e x c = n e x c . ( 1 + P . M H 2 Z . ρ l q . R . T )"
8,Experimental design,"2.7 Experimental design RSM is a better and more accurate optimization in comparison to the traditional single parameter optimization as it saves space, time, and materials. Response surface method (RSM) is a mathematical and statistical technique to forecast a model where a desire response influenced by several variables and optimized by the model. To maximizing the hydrogen adsorption on Cu-BDC@rGO, there are three independent variables such as metal/linker molar ratio, GO concentration in the solvent (mg/ml) and microwave time (Sec) that could affect the adsorption capacity. It is worth noting microwave time stands for combining two other features, reaction temperature, the residence time of solutions in a microfluidic reaction channel and reaction tube diameter. In other words, these three parameters are hidden in microwave time and do not act independently. Table 1 presents three independent variables affecting the adsorption capacity of Cu-BDC@rGO and three levels of each parameter."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Effect of heating mechanism on hydrogen adsorption capacity,"3.1 Effect of heating mechanism on hydrogen adsorption capacity To compare the effect of heating mechanisms (conventional heating and MW-assisted microfluidic), pure Cu-BDC was selected for hydrogen adsorption evaluation at 77 K and 40 bar. Results showed that the hydrogen adsorption capacity of crystals that obtained by MW-assisted microfluidic method (Cu-BDCMW-M) was 13% greater than crystals obtained by conventional heating method (Cu-BDCCon-H). The conventional method transfers heat through a conduction mechanism to the reaction medium. This process leads to non-uniform heat dispersion in reaction medium. While MW-assisted microfluidic process internally produces the necessary energy in the reaction medium. Furthermore, MW-assisted microfluidic system brings two important features: (i) creating internal hotspots with uniform dispersion and (ii) facilitating MW irradiation diffusion through a micro channel. In result, the intensive and uniform energy can be originated under MW irradiation and intensifying the nucleation and crystal formation in the reaction [5]. It is noteworthy that MW-assisted microfluidic method enhances the reaction yield and product quality by increasing the nuclei population in the reaction medium. Here, the yield of Cu-BDCMW-M production was 18% greater than Cu-BDCCon-H MOF. The SEM images (Fig. 2 ) of produced Cu-BDC by various methods show that the crystal size of Cu-BDCMW-M is more uniform and smaller than Cu-BDCCon-H. The crystal size itself could be a key parameter in adsorption process. In fact, smaller crystal size has more accessible adsorption sites and lower adsorption resistance. In addition, trapped solvent and linker molecules could be easily extracted from the small crystals. Regarding to significant advantageous of MW-assisted microfluidic, this method has been selected for further investigations."
11,Effect of synthesis parameters on hydrogen adsorption,"3.2 Effect of synthesis parameters on hydrogen adsorption As mentioned before, Box-Behnken design (BBD) applied to fix the best synthesis condition of Cu-BDC@rGO with maximum hydrogen uptake. So, the hydrogen adsorption capacity of Cu-BDC@rGO samples at the examined condition of 40 bar and 77 K chosen as the “response”. The proper BBD equation used to find the best condition. Also, the significant factors and the importance of their effects or interactions would identify by an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Using the BBD, the effect of GO concentration (χ1), metal/linker molar ratio (χ2), and microwave time (χ3) on hydrogen uptake studied. The BBD creates an empirical relation between variables in the tested conditions range. This equation in coded units presented in following: (9) H2 uptake (mmol/g) = 16.2 - 0.6125 χ1 + 0.6375 χ2 + 0.15 χ3 - 1.0875 χ12 - 0.2375 χ22 - 1.6125 χ32 + 0.1250 χ1*χ2 By ANOVA, it revealed that all the parameters contain GO concentration, metal/linker ratio, and microwave time had an effective roll in hydrogen uptake at examined condition (Supplementary materials, Table S1). The effect of parameters and coefficients could be determined by P-value. In fact, the model terms will be significant if the P value is less than 0.05. So, GO concentration (χ1), metal/linker molar ratio (χ2), and microwave time (χ3) are the significant parameters of the model. Other coefficients found to be insignificant. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R2 adj) and the predicted coefficient of determination (R2 pred) of the model are 0.9936 and 0.9681, respectively. It showed the model is stable and predicted value from the model has good agreement with the experimental data. Also, the normal probability plot and the nearness of the measured hydrogen uptake to the predicted hydrogen uptake confirmed the trust of the empirical model (Supplementary materials, Figure S1). As mentioned before, the model proposed a relationship between the independent variable (hydrogen uptake) and dependent variables (GO concentration, metal/linker molar ration, and MW time) that studied by response surfaces and contour plots. Significantly, the RSM method considers the simultaneous effects of all variables in one model, so, there may be several relations which could result in the best response. This challenge leads to some inconsistencies. The binary effects of each dependent variable are presented in supplementary materials (Figures S2-S4). 3.2.1 Effect of GO concentration Fig. 3 presents the effect of GO concentration on hydrogen uptake at constant MW time and metal/linker molar ratio. GO concentration in DMF varied from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml in three stages. As could be seen, the hydrogen uptake decreased after a certain GO concentration around 0.9 mg ml−1. This is due to the low delamination yield of graphite oxide flakes at higher concentration. Indeed, low delamination yield of graphite oxide flakes increased the population of multilayer GO with lower accessible functional group for modulation process. This phenomenon leads to low hydrogen uptake by reducing the pore volume and specific surface area of the adsorbent. Moreover, GO as modulation agent reduces the formation of MOFs with poor crystallinity by preventing precursors to convert to amorphous shape. In fact, during the reaction, modulators compete with linkers to coordinate with metal ions and increase the render of framework by exchange of functional group between GO and linkers. In result, the production of amorphous precursors prevented and the crystallinity and production yield of the MOF enhanced. Also, lower GO concentration could have similar effect as we observed by partially exfoliated flakes. Although low GO concentrations lead to low delamination yield, the number of separated functional nanosheets may be insufficient for the modulation process. Therefore, there is an optimum point for GO concentration. By BBD, this point obtained about 0.9 mg/ml. 3.2.2 Effect of metal/linker ratio On the influence of metal/linker ratio on hydrogen uptake at constant GO concentration and MW time, it revealed that, by increasing the metal/linker ratio, hydrogen adsorption increased. It is worth noting there is a direct relationship between the concentration of reactants with the size of MOF crystals and final active sites and pores for gas storage. When the concentration of reactants, especially the linker, is in excess, linker molecules will trap in the MOF network and blocked the active pores. So, it has needed to use a solution as diluted as possible with metal/linker molar ratio higher than one during the synthesis (Fig. 4 ). As a conclusion, the linker works as limiting reactant in the synthesis process and controls the progress of the reaction. Lack of linker in the reaction media may stop the crystallization and therefore, the linker’s concentration should control higher than the threshold concentration. 3.2.3 Effect of MW time For the effect of MW time at constant GO concentration and metal/linker molar ratio, a maximum point around 10 s observed (Fig. 5 ). As explained before, the synthesis temperature is dependent on the MW time. At constant MW power, by increasing the MW time, the synthesis temperature would increase to specific value. So, the synthesis temperature and MW time are in the direct relation. For the effect of temperature, there is the best temperature at 10 s MW time. It means that the precursors reach to required temperatures after 10 s in micro channel. The micro channel facilitates the MW irradiation diffusion through the solvent and leads to uniform heating by creating thousands of hotspots in the reaction medium. So, by accelerating the crystallization of MOF through the MW-assisted micro channel the size of crystals decreased. In result, the adsorption capacity enhanced due to reduced adsorption resistance and more active adsorption sites. At low temperatures (low MW time), the specific surface area and pore volume are lower than that of the best synthesis temperature. Moreover, low temperature increases the concentration of amorphous precursors leading to flawed frameworks. On the other hand, high synthesis temperatures increase the metal oxide concentration in the solution and open the benzene ring of the linker and destroy the MOF. So, the hydrogen uptake reduced suddenly. In fact, at high temperatures, MOF would not produce. 3.2.4 Best synthesis condition Table 2 presented the best synthesis conditions (GO concentration, metal/linker molar ratio, and MW time) resulted in the maximum hydrogen uptake in this research, recognized by BBD method. The synthesis conditions for Cu-BDC also presented in Table 2 for comparison. As mentioned before, production yield of Cu-BDC though conventional heating was about 45.5% compared to 54% for that of synthesized in MW-assisted microfluidic method. As presented in Table 2, modulation agent (GO) has significant effect on production yield. Also, the modulation method is very important, so that the production yield Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 is 28.5% greater than Cu-BDC@rGO-R1. This phenomenon is due to the population of functional groups on the GO nanosheets at the reaction with linkers. As explained in synthesis section, the population of functional groups on GO in two-step preparation is lower than that of one-step preparation. This issue decreases the functional group exchange between GO and linkers to compete and form a framework."
12,Characterization,"3.3 Characterization 3.3.1 Crystal structure and X-ray diffraction pattern Fig. 6 shows the crystal structure that is supposed to form in the synthesis process. In fact, it was very hard to find a crystal with necessary specifications for single-crystal analysis, as the MW-assisted microfluidic process produces fine powder. In result of broadened PXRD pattern of small crystallites, the structure of Cu-BDC could not be found by conventional procedures. However, this structure has been reported by some other researches [31,32]. The gained crystals from the MW-assisted microfluidic process at 170 W washed three times with pure DMF to remove unreacted terephthalic acid and dried at 180 °C in vacuum condition for 12 h to remove the trapped solvent. The X-ray diffraction pattern of Cu-BDC in Fig. 7 matches well with the simulated pattern. As expected for composite MOFs, the intensity of peaks has been decreased. Moreover, the amorphous humps and peak displacement have also appeared in the PXRD patterns of composite MOFs. As could see, the PXRD patterns of Cu-BDC@rGO-R1 and Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 are almost similar to original Cu-BDC by little changes. Also, the peaks of composite MOFs are sharper compared with pure MOF. This phenomenon is due to the formation of Cu-BDC on GO substrate (modulation effect) and fast crystallization by MW irradiation [5,31]. 3.3.2 TGA analysis The thermal stability of Cu-BDC, Cu-BDC@rGO-R1, Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 samples examined by TGA analysis. There are three weight loss stages in TGA diagram (Fig. 8 ). First two stages from 298 K to around 630 K could be due to the removal of solvent molecules extracted from large and small pores. Temperatures above 630 K leading to loss of functional groups and MOF decomposition. Results show that all the pure and composite MOF have suitable stability under an argon atmosphere. The plots also showed thermal stability of Cu-BDC increased after GO incorporation and the Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 has the highest thermal stability [33–36]. 3.3.3 Pore size distribution and specific surface area N2 sorption at 77 K indicates that the pure and composite MOFs show type I isotherm (Fig. 9 ). According to Table 3 , the specific surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter of composite materials (Cu-BDC@rGO-R1, and Cu-BDC@rGO-R2) increased. This is due to the modulation effect of GO on MOF formation. These features are lower for pure MOF in comparison to composite one. Further, Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 has the highest specific surface area, mean pore size and mean pore volume among all samples. This point confirms the effect of synthesis route on hydrogen adsorption capacity. This result has good agreement with similar work [38]. As could be seen (Fig. 10 ), the pore size distribution of pure and composite materials compared. All diagrams except diagrams of GO and graphene, show pore size distribution with one sharp peak and small pore diameter about 1.7 nm. By this finding, the materials are microporous [37]. This feature is important for gas adsorption. 3.3.4 SEM, EDX, and TEM The morphology of nanocomposites is presented by TEM images in Fig. 11 for comparison, TEM images of GO and metal anchored GO (Cu@GO) also included. In the TEM image of Cu@GO, the metal clearly anchored on the nanosheets. This is due to the presence of functional groups such as carboxyl, epoxide, and hydroxyl on GO nanosheets [39]. As mentioned before, the SEM image shows that Cu-BDC preparation by MW-assisted microfluidic will increase the uniformity in the size of produced crystals (Fig. 2). The energy dispersive X-ray results (Table 4 and supplementary materials Figure S7) of the nanocomposites show that carbon, oxygen, and copper scattered well on the surface, which suggests that for all composites, GO and Cu interact to form new materials with homogeneous shape and chemistry. Altogether, it could say metal ions or clusters and the functional groups on GO nanosheets act as active sites and modulators for MOF growth respectively. Given the textural differences between Cu-BDC@rGO-R1 and Cu-BDC@rGO-R2, it is reasonable to assume that functional groups on GO would act as a modulator. The difference between two routes leads to form worm-like and sandwich-like structures (Supplementary material Fig. S5). In the first route, after connecting copper ions onto the GO nanosheets, GO would reduce to graphene nanosheets with no more functional groups. So, the MOF would be growth on copper node anchored to graphene in the form of rods or worm-like structures with mean 74 nm diameter and 1 μm length. But the object is slightly different from the second method. In the second route, the MOF covered the whole nanosheets or sandwiched between two or more nanosheets. This route increases the production yield from 54% for Cu-BDC and 63% for Cu-BDC@rGO-R1 to 81% for Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 based on mass production. 3.3.5 IR spectrum IR measurements carried out to confirm the composite formation. Results of measurements and their matching peaks showed in Fig. 12 . For all spectrum, the band around 3400 cm−1 associated with stretching vibration of OH groups. This peak is significantly weak for Cu-BDC@rGO-R1, R2 spectrum due to improving the water resistance of the composite material. From GO spectra, the peaks around 1625 cm−1 and 1730 cm−1 match to CC skeletal vibration of the aromatic ring and the CO carboxyl stretching vibration or conjugated carbonyl groups, respectively. Further, the peak at 1398 cm−1, 1230 cm−1, and 1089 cm−1 related to −OH from carboxyl, C–O–C from epoxy, and C–O from alkoxy, respectively [40]. As could see from the IR spectra of Cu-BDC, Cu-BDC@rGO-R1, and Cu-BDC@rGO-R2, the peaks matching to Cu-BDC@rGO-R1, R2 is sharper than Cu-BDC spectra. This due to the modulation effect of GO on the MOF formation. The band at 2930 cm−1 is the sign of C–H stretching vibration of DMF. The peaks around 1350 and 1650 cm−1 show the coordinating carboxylate anion groups of BDC to the copper nodes. In fact, the peaks at 1666 cm−1, 1625 cm−1 stand for asymmetrical stretching vibrations and the peaks around 1396 cm−1 and 1508 cm−1 stands for symmetrical stretching vibrations of the di-carboxylate groups of BDC [41]. Creation of two more peaks and the ratio of these peaks in the form of 1666/1625 cm−1 and 1396/1508 cm−1 show the changes in modulation of carboxylate ligands with copper nodes. On the other hand, the interaction of ligands with functional groups of GO caused the change in the structure of Cu-BDC by introducing GO."
13,Adsorption,"3.4 Adsorption 3.4.1 Hydrogen excess uptake The excess adsorption capacity of the MOFs measured at 298 K and 77 K up to 40 bar. Fig. 13 presents the results of adsorption at cryogenic temperature. The adsorption isotherms show the monolayer adsorption for pure and composite MOFs which is illustrated by the IUPAC as type I isotherm. In this regard, the Langmuir model well fitted the adsorption data. This phenomenon shows physisorption of hydrogen on the adsorbents. The fitted variables of the Langmuir model are listed in Table 5 . As could see in Fig. 13, the rapid increase of H2 adsorption in the lower pressure region is a sign of adsorption site saturation. This is due to the strong bond between H2 and adsorbent at lower pressures. This phenomenon is not detectable at room temperature. Compared to maximum adsorption capacity (qm) of Cu-BDC equal to 10.05 mmol g−1, the maximum hydrogen adsorption on Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 and Cu-BDC@rGO-R1 composite materials increased to 16.66 and 14.37 mmol g−1 respectively (Fig. 13 and Table 5). This result could positively correlate to the specific surface area and the pore volume of the composite materials (Table 3). At room temperature, hydrogen uptake of Cu-BDC is a little lower than Cu-BDC@rGO-R1 and Cu-BDC@rGO-R2, while this value for Cu-BDC@rGO-R1 and Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 are almost identical. Adsorption capacity at 298 K and 40 bar was around 0.30, 0.36 and 0.38 mmol g−1 for Cu-BDC, Cu-BDC@rGO-R1, and Cu-BDC@rGO-R1 respectively. We should note that hydrogen storage capacity of Cu-BDC@rGO composites is greater than pure Cu-BDC at both 77 K and room temperatures. This shows that graphene-MOF composite improves both the specific surface area and accessibility of hydrogen molecules to open metal sites at both temperatures. Low temperatures such as 77 K thermodynamically increase the saturation of vacant adsorption sites [42,43]. Also, low temperatures increase the gas density and population of molecules around an active adsorption site. In result, more gas molecules would trap in the adsorbent pores. Further, there would be some explanations for increased adsorption capacity of Cu-BDC@rGO composites at both 298 K and 77 K. As mentioned before, GO act as modulation agent and enlarge the pore size and volume by increasing the distance between two metal nodes. So, the trapped BDC molecules in the pores of frameworks decrease and enhance the accessible volume of pores. 3.4.2 Isosteric heat of adsorption Heat transfer calculations in a hydrogen storage tank directly depend on the isosteric heat of adsorption. The heat of adsorption would calculate by Van't Hoff equation at constant surface coverage. The fugacity of hydrogen used instead of the equilibrium pressure for more accurate calculation [44]. (10) Δ H = R . ( ∂ ( ln f ) ∂ ( 1 T ) ) θ where ΔH is the reaction enthalpy, f is the hydrogen fugacity at equilibrium pressure and θ is the surface coverage based on absolute adsorption. Tsonopolous correlation used for hydrogen fugacity calculation at equilibrium pressure by multiplying the pressure and compressibility factor. Also, as mentioned before, the surface coverage determined based on absolute adsorption. At different temperatures (77 K, 87 K, and 97 K) and constant surface coverage θ, the logarithm plot of the fugacity versus 1/T leads to a diagonal line with a slope equal to the enthalpy of adsorption. The result of the isosteric heat of adsorption in some surface coverage has presented in Fig. 14 . The negative value of ΔH shows exothermic adsorption of hydrogen on the samples. The maximum negative value of ΔH was calculated as high as 9.1 kJ/mol at the lowest surface coverage for Cu-BDC@rGO-R2. As could see, the heat of adsorption decreases by increasing θ. This event could be due to a decrease in the strength of the bonds between the active pores and sites of Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 and hydrogen molecules at higher θ [45]. Further, at lowest θ, the heat of adsorption for Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 is higher than the heat of adsorption for Cu-BDC (8.4 kJ/mol). This event shows the bonds between a hydrogen molecule and the composite sample is stronger than that of the Cu-BDC."
14,Conclusions,"As a conclusion, the MW-assisted microfluidic method reduced the synthesis time to about seconds or minutes compared to conventional heating synthesis time about hours. Also, the MW-assisted microfluidic leads to uniform MOF crystal size and shape. Moreover, using a microfluidic channel not only ease the continuous synthesis and control on reaction media but also reduced the size of synthesis chamber and instruments for industrial applications. The studies indicated that the MW- assisted microfluidic method increased the production yield, adsorption capacity, and MOF crystal quality compared to conventional heating method. The production yield and hydrogen adsorption capacity of Cu-BDC was 18% and 26% greater for MW-assisted microfluidic method product. In result, the MW- assisted microfluidic method selected for modulation effect evaluations. Results indicated that the presence of GO as modulation agent played an undeniable role on the surface area, pore diameter and pore volume of the MOF by affecting on coordinating reaction during MW-assisted microfluidic process. Findings also show that the synthesis of composite MOF through MW-assisted microfluidic method lead to higher production yield and materials with enhanced crystallinity. In fact, decoration of GO with Cu-BDC, improved the thermal stability, pore size, and specific surface area of the adsorbent. These events increased the accessibility and density of active adsorption sites and intensifying the adsorption capacity at 77 K and 40 bar. Also, experiments showed that the adsorbent shape namely cubic, worm-like or sandwich-like is important in adsorption capacity. Among these, the composite namely Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 (sandwich-like) had the best hydrogen adsorption capacity, production yield and crystal quality compared to other materials. RSM was used to find the best synthesis condition of this composite. The optimum synthesis condition of this composite was in the 0.9 mg ml−1 GO concentration, 2/1 metal/linker molar ratio, and 10 s Mw time through second route (one step MW-assisted microfluidic). The adsorption experiments showed that the Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 had the best hydrogen adsorption capacity compared to pure Cu-BDC (16.66 mmol g−1 for Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 versus 10.05 mmol g−1 for Cu-BDC). This result is due to the coupled effects of MW-assisted microfluidic process and GO modulation. Finally, it should be mentioned that the hydrogen bond with Cu-BDC@rGO-R2 was stronger than that of other samples according to isosteric heat of adsorption results."
