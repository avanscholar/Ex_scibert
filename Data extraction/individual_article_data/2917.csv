0,Introduction,"p-Aminophenol (PAP) is a commercially important intermediate for manufacture of analgesic and antipyretic drugs such as p-acetaminophenol, photographic developers, and dyes. Synthesis of PAP via a single-step catalytic hydrogenation of NB has been widely studied, as it is the most promising route in chemical industry with the cheapest NB reagent and the lowest energy consumption [1–13]. It involves an initial hydrogenation of NB to PHA, and the following in situ rearrangement of PHA to PAP under acid catalysis. Conventionally, concentrated liquid acid is used to catalyze the rearrangement of PHA, produces PAP with a high selectivity of 75% at the complete NB conversion [1]. However, the use of liquid acid brings some disadvantages such as strong corrosion, post-reaction neutralization and salt disposal. To resolve these problems, bifunctional catalysts with acid sites and metallic active species were well developed and studied [14–22]. For example, with a mixture of 2% Pt/ZrO2 and Zr(SO4)2, a 86% selectivity of PAP was obtained at a conversion of 97% [16]. Over Pt-Pb/MgAPO-5, the selectivity to PAP reached 71% at complete conversion of NB [22]. However, it is still a big challenge to develop the more efficient and green catalytic system for the production of PAP. Recently, the utilization of green solvents to replace conventional toxic organic solvent is an important theme in the fields of green and sustainable chemical synthesis. Supercritical CO2 (scCO2) and H2O as green solvents have been studied extensively not only because both CO2 and H2O are non-toxic, nonflammable, abundant, cheap, renewable and easy to handle, but also due to they are interesting and efficient promoter in some chemical reactions [23–26]. When H2O is compressed with CO2, the acidity of the solution can reach about 3 at a wide range of pressure and temperature [27,28], and the solution can be easily self-neutralized by depressurization of CO2 after reaction [29]. In situ generated carbonic acid from CO2 and H2O can replace the conventional hazardous acids such as HCl and H2SO4 without requiring post reaction neutralization and disposal of salts in some acid catalyzed reactions, e.g., transamidation of urea and amines [30], reduction of nitroarenes [31,32], aldehydes [33], imines [34], sulfoxides and pyridine-N-oxides [35] with Fe or Zn metal, reductive Ullmann coupling with Zn and Pd/C [36], hydrolysis of ketals, acetals, epoxides and olefin [37–39], dehydration of diols [40,41], synthesis of hydrogen peroxide [42], oxybromination of arenes [43,44], diazotization of anilines [45], diiodination of alkynes [46], Bamberger rearrangement of N-arylhydroxylamine [47]. In addition, the reaction rate could be improved with introduction of compressed CO2 into some aqueous hydrogenation reactions [48–55], such as acetophenone hydrogenation with Pd/C catalyst [49], benzyl alcohol hydrogenation with Ru/MCM-41 catalyst [50], and benzyl cyanide hydrogenation with Pd/Al2O3 catalyst [53]. Most recently, it was reported that CO2-H2O system is effective for the hydrogenation of NB to PAP over the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, and the yield of PAP reached 55% [56]. Herein, the efficiency of scCO2 and H2O combined medium was discussed in detail for the production of PAP from the hydrogenation of NB with a traditional Pt/Al2O3 catalyst without the addition of any liquid or solid acids. A high yield (68.9%) of PAP was obtained in the present catalysis system, it was certified that the carbonic acid generated in situ and the changes of phase behavior contributed to the high yield of PAP. Most importantly, CO generated in situ during the reaction was confirmed to contribute to the high selectivity of PAP, as it adsorbed and modified the surface of Pt/Al2O3 to suppress the undesired deep hydrogenation of PHA to AN."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials NB and AN (AR grade, Beijing Chem. Corp., China), nitrosobenzene (NSB, AR grade, Aldrich), and PAP (AR grade, Aladdin) were used without further purification. Commercially unavailable PHA was synthesized according to literature [57], the formation of PHA was confirmed by FTIR and NMR (JEOL A200II) [58]. Hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was purchased from shanghai Huishi chemical. 5% Ru/Al2O3 and 5% Pd/Al2O3 were purchased from Wako. γ-Al2O3 (<140mesh, 170m2/g), SiO2 (35–60mesh, Aldrich), carbon black (C, <140mesh, 254m2/g) and active carbon (AC, 100–400mesh, Aldrich), H2PtCl6·6H2O (Aladdin) were used as delivered. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethanol and acetic acid (AcOH) are of analytical grade, and the pH value of AcOH aqueous solution was adjusted to 3.0 at 25°C. CH3CN (HPLC grade, Fisher) and deionized H2O were used for HPLC analysis. Gases of CO2 (99.999%), H2 (99.999%), N2 (99.999%) (Changchun Juyang Gas Company), and CO (99.999%) (Dalian Special Gases CO., LTD) were used as delivered."
3,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.2 Catalyst preparation and characterization 1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous H2PtCl6·6H2O solution and γ-Al2O3. In typically, 1.98g γ-Al2O3 was impregnated with 5ml aqueous solution containing 0.0531g H2PtCl6·6H2O and stirred at 70°C for about 1h. After that, the wetness sample was dried overnight at 80°C, calcined in air flow (30ml/min) at 350°C for 2h and finally reduced in H2 flow (30ml/min) at 100°C for 2h. After reduction, H2 was changed to N2 and the quartz tube was cooled down to room temperature. The preparation of 1% Pt/SiO2, 0.1% Pt/C and 0.1% Pt/AC was similar to 1% Pt/Al2O3 as described above. 5% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was also prepared by incipient wetness impregnation as described above. The sample was calcined in air flow (30ml/min) at 450°C for 2h. Before reaction, the calcinated sample (100mg) was freshly reduced in a quartz tube in H2 flow (30ml/min) at 450°C for 2h; then, H2 was changed to N2 and the quartz tube was cooled down to room temperature. The reduced Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was transferred into the autoclave reactor in N2 flow in which 20ml solvent was added. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed with a D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer (Fig. S1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using JEM-2010EX (Fig. S1). Diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRFTIR) was carried out on a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector. Prior to the measurement, the reduced 1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was in situ pre-reduced in pure H2 (30mlmin−1) at 100°C for 20min. After that, the sample was cooled down to 30°C and a flow of high purity helium (30mlmin−1) was fed to remove the residual H2. A background spectrum was collected (B1). Then, a gas flow of 90% helium and 10% CO (70mlmin−1) was introduced into the chamber for 30min. Finally, the sample was purged by helium for 15min and the spectrum was collected based on B1. For the measurement in the mixture gas of H2 and CO2, after the pre-reduction and the purge with helium, H2 (2MPa) and CO2 (4MPa) were introduced into the chamber, a background spectrum was collected (B2). Then the sample was heated to 140°C for 30min and then cooled down to 30°C, the spectrum was recorded based on B2. In all the cases the spectra were taken at 30°C."
4,Hydrogenation of nitrobenzene,"2.3 Hydrogenation of nitrobenzene Prior to reaction, the diffusion effect was checked by changing the size of catalyst and the stirring speed. The calcined catalysts were ground and separated by screen of 140 and 180 meshes, with which the reaction rate did not change with the size of catalyst as the inner transfer resistance was removed. In addition, it is confirmed when the stirring speed is above 700rpm, the reaction rate did not increase further, indicating the external diffusion has been removed. As a result, the catalyst with a particle size smaller than 180 meshes (80μm) was used, and 1200rpm was selected for the reactions to evaluate the catalytic performances. The hydrogenation of NB was carried out in a 50ml high-pressure stainless steel batch reactor. In a typical experiment, 0.5wt.% CTAB aqueous solution (20ml), 1% Pt/Al2O3 (10mg), NB (1mmol) and DMSO (10μl) were added into the reactor, and the reactor was then sealed and flushed with N2 more than three times and putted into a 140°C oil bath for about 10min. H2 (1MPa) and then CO2 (14MPa) were introduced into the reactor. Then the reaction mixture was stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer (1200rpm) for 2h. After reaction, the reactor was cooled in ice-water bath and depressurized slowly. The reaction mixture was dissolved with ethanol and centrifuged, and the solution set the volume to be 50ml with ethanol. The reactant and products were analyzed by HPLC (Shimadzu, LC-20AB) with UV detector (Shimadzu, SPD-20A, λ=232nm) and COSMOSIL 5C18-PAQ column (4.6 ID×250mm) at 50°C. CH3CN/H2O (50/50, V/V) was used as eluent and the flow rate was 0.6ml/min. The conversion of NB and the selectivity of PAP were calculated as follows: Conversion =([NB]0 −[NB]t)/[NB]0 ×100% Selectivity =MPAP/(MPAP +Mby-products)×100% where [NB]0 and [NB]t refers to the concentration of NB at 0 and t h, respectively; MPAP and Mby-products represents the moles of PAP and by-products (e.g. AN, NSB, PHA and a series of azo-compounds), respectively. The HPLC results were collected with an external standard method (Fig. S2). The carbon balance was near 100% on the basis of the detected compounds of NB, NSB, PHA, AOB and AB. For the reaction in the presence of CO, 0.5ml pure CO was injected into the reactor before the introduction of 1MPa H2. For the transformation of PHA in CO2-H2O, for comparison with the results in AcOH aqueous, in order to prohibit the disproportionation of PHA to NSB and AN in the absence of acid catalyst, CO2 (1MPa) should be introduced into reactor before the preheating process."
5,Visual observation of the phase behavior,"2.4 Visual observation of the phase behavior The observation of the phase state was carried out in an 85ml high-pressure view cell with a same volumetric ratio of NB to the reactor volume as used in the reactions. In a typical process, NB (1.7mmol), DMSO (17μl), CTAB (170mg) and H2O (34ml) were added and the reactor was heated up to 140°C, H2 (1MPa) and then liquid CO2 was introduced into the reactor to the required pressure. At each pressure the mixture was stirred for several minutes, and then the stirring was stopped and the phase behavior was observed by the naked eye through the transparent sapphire windows."
6,Results,"The synthesis of PAP based on hydrogenation of NB usually involves a hydrogenation catalyst and an acid catalyst. The reaction starts with an initial hydrogenation of NB to PHA, and then with the rearrangement of PHA to PAP, accompanying with a side reaction of PHA hydrogenation to AN which is the main competing side product besides the ordinary side products in NB hydrogenation like NSB, azoxybenzene (AOB) and azobenzene (AB), as shown in Scheme 1 [19,59]. Thereby, it is a great challenge to selectively produce PAP in the hydrogenation of NB in the absence of any additional acid catalysts. Herein, the catalysts and reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, NB concentration, H2 pressure, and the additives like CTAB and DMSO were screened and discussed, and the effect of CO2 pressure as well as its role played in the reaction was discussed in detail."
7,Comparison of metal supported catalysts,"3.1 Comparison of metal supported catalysts The activities of several supported catalysts such as Ni, Ru, Pd and Pt supported on Al2O3 have been examined and compared in the hydrogenation of NB. As listed in Table 1 , the reaction rate of the active metals follows an order of Pt∼Pd>Ru>Ni, and the order of PAP selectivity is Pt>Pd>Ru>Ni (entries 1–4). Over Ni/Al2O3 or Ru/Al2O3, a lot of condensation products of AOB and AB were produced, while over Ni/Al2O3 or Pd/Al2O3, deep hydrogenation product of AN was produced largely. Among these catalysts, Pt/Al2O3 gave the best selectivity to PAP (72.2%) with the higher reaction rate (417h−1). Furthermore, the catalysis supports such as SiO2, carbon black (C), active carbon (AC) and Al2O3 were compared, it follows an active order of Al2O3 <SiO2 <C<AC, while, reversely the selectivity to PAP follows an order of Al2O3 >SiO2 >C>AC. The high selectivity of Al2O3 support may be ascribed to its higher acidity."
8,The additives,"3.2 The additives In order to improve the selectivity of PAP, the addition of CTAB and DMSO was examined and the results are listed in Table 2 . When CTAB was added with a NB/CTAB molar ratio of 3.6, the conversion decreased from 76.2% to 55.6%, however, the selectivity of PAP increased from 53.9% to 63.9%. In the presence of CTAB, an oil-in-water (O/W) microemulsion was formed [60]. CTAB interacts with NB phase by the alkyl chain being oriented towards the interior of droplet and the hydrophilic part (−N+(CH3)3·Br−), forming a protective film around the dispersed phase [61]. The surface charge may hinder H2 flow through the interface of O/W emulsion and cause a decrease of the hydrogenation rate. However, this surface charge does not affect the migration of PHA from NB phase to the acidic aqueous phase, but the addition of CTAB could lead to a reduction in the size of NB droplet and favor the migration of PHA [2]. In this way, the condensation and the deep hydrogenation reactions were inhibited. Furthermore, The addition of DMSO greatly affect the conversion of NB and the selectivity to PAP, the conversion decreased from 55.6% to 42.7%, however, the selectivity of PAP increased from 63.9% to 72.2%, which is similar to the literature [62], that the organic sulfur compounds including DMSO could prohibit the hydrogenation of NB but improve the selectivity of PAP in H2SO4. The organic sulfur compounds could strong adsorb on the Pt nanoparticles, resulting in the reduction of the amount of catalytic active sites and hydrogenation activity [63]. Thus, the hydrogenation of PHA was lowered and left more chances for the rearrangement of PHA to PAP as they are competitive reactions."
9,Temperature,"3.3 Temperature The effect of temperature on both conversion and selectivity was studied within a temperature range of 80–160°C in 10MPa CO2-H2O and the results are presented in Fig. 1 . The conversion of NB increased from 7.4% to 100% with temperature increasing, and the selectivity of PAP increased from 6.0% to 68.6% with increasing temperature from 80 to 140°C, and then decreased slightly to 64.3% at 160°C. The rearrangement of PHA to PAP is an endothermic reaction, so the higher temperature may favor its transformation, resulting in the higher selectivity to PAP. Moreover, the higher temperature may favor the hydrogenation of PHA to AN, and slightly lower the acidity of CO2-H2O medium at the constant partial pressure of CO2 [27,28], thus the rearrangement rate was lowered, resulting in the lower selectivity of PAP at the higher temperature of 160°C."
10,Initial NB concentration and reaction time,"3.4 Initial NB concentration and reaction time Typical results for the effect of the initial NB concentration at a range of 0.025–0.2M on the hydrogenation of NB in 14MPa CO2-H2O systems are shown in Fig. 2 . Although the conversion of NB decreased monotonously with increasing of initial NB concentration, the reaction rate of NB increased. The selectivity to PAP was almost constant at lower NB concentration, but it decreased with further increasing of concentration above 0.05M. The increase of initial NB concentration could lead to an increase in the size of NB droplet. In a certain extent, the bigger NB droplet the more difficult migration of PHA from NB phase to aqueous phase, resulted in a serious condensation from PHA to AOB and AB, and the selectivity of PAP decreased. Usually, the product selectivity depends on the conversion in the hydrogenation of NB. Fig. 3 shows the evolution of product distribution with time under the same conditions. With extending reaction time, the conversion increased and reached 98.5% within 5h, the selectivity of PAP increased initially and then remained around 68% after 2h, the selectivity of PHA decreased but that of AN increased monotonously. As an intermediate product, PHA was produced with a selectivity of 33.4% initially at a conversion of 35.9%, then it transformed to PAP and AN. As the rearrangement rate kept a constant in this acidic system, and the transformation of PHA to AN was much slower compared to the rearrangement, so the selectivity of PAP changed slightly after 2h."
11,H2 and CO2 pressure,"3.5 H2 and CO2 pressure The effect of hydrogen partial pressure on the conversion and the selectivity was studied at a range of 0.4–1.3MPa in 10MPa CO2-H2O (Fig. 4 ). With increasing of H2 pressure, the conversion increased almost linearly from 50.4% to 92.6%. The selectivity of PAP was around 65% with a slight change, but the selectivity of PHA decreased from 11.7% to 1.3%. The local hydrogen concentration in the interior of NB droplets increased with H2 pressure, enhanced primarily the hydrogenation rates of NB to PHA and PHA to AN. However, the hydrogenation of PHA to AN, even at sufficient hydrogen amount, was relatively slow compared to the rearrangement of PHA to PAP, so the selectivity of PAP changed slightly with conversion at the range of 0.4–1.3MPa H2. The effect of CO2 pressure was examined at a range of 0–14MPa as shown in Fig. 5 . In the absence of CO2, AN was produced with a selectivity of 98.4%, without PAP was detected. However, with introduction of CO2, PAP was produced as the main product, and its selectivity reached almost a constant around 70% at CO2 pressures above 10MPa. On the contrary, the selectivity of AN decreased from 98.4% to 11.2%. These results indicate that the hydrogenation of NB to PAP could take place through the Bamberger rearrangement of PHA in CO2–H2O. At CO2 pressure <8MPa, the conversion of NB changed slightly around 98.8%, but with further increasing CO2 pressure up to 14MPa, the conversion decreased obviously."
12,Discussion,
13,Effect of CO2,"4.1 Effect of CO2 Carbonic acid can formed in H2O with pressured CO2, the pH value of CO2–H2O system was about 3 at a wide range of pressures and temperatures [27,28], and so some acid catalysis reactions could be performed in CO2−H2O system [30–47]. Therefore, the acidity of the present system may promote the Bamberger rearrangement of PHA to PAP and thus the high selectivity to PAP of 72.2% was obtained in 14MPa CO2-H2O system (Table 3 , entries 1,2), which is in agreement to the results in literature, that about 69% selectivity to PAP was obtained from NB hydrogenation over a Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst in CO2-H2O system, in which the acidity was considered to be the main factor for production of PAP with high selectivity. But it maybe not the sole factor, some other factors should exist for the present NB hydrogenation catalyzed with Pt/Al2O3 in CO2–H2O system. To confirm this point, we designed several experiments, that the hydrogenation of NB were carried out in AcOH aqueous solution with a similar pH value of 3 in the presence or absence of CO2 as seen in Table 3, the conversion of NB was high (100%), but the selectivity to PAP was as low as 25.2% in the absence of CO2 (entry 3). However, with the introduction of 14MPa into AcOH aqueous solution, the conversion of NB decreased, while the selectivity to PAP increased to 60.3% (entry 4). Moreover, at the similar pH values, the conversion and selectivity to PAP varied significantly with the introduction of CO2 at a range of 2–14MPa (Fig. 5). These results strongly indicated the acidity is an important factor for production of PAP, but not the sole or the dominative one in present catalysis system. Furthermore, the hydrogenation of NB was also studied in AcOH aqueous solution with the presence of CO (0.5ml), the selectivity of PAP still increased from 25.2% to 67.7% but the conversion decreased remarkably from 100% to 35.7% (Table 3, entries 3 vs. 5). It is similar to the results in the AcOH aqueous solution in the presence of 14MPa CO2 (entries 4). Therefore, CO was supposed to produce in situ by the reverse water-gas shift reaction over Pt/Al2O3 in the present CO2–H2O system and CO may adsorb on the surface of catalyst to retard the steps of hydrogenation. The similar results were found in the hydrogenation over supported Pt catalysts in the presence of CO2, in which CO was produced and affected the catalytic activity and selectivity [64–67]. Moreover, the intermediate of PHA was used as starting reactant to further check the role of CO2. With the introduction of CO2 to 14MPa the conversion of PHA was above 94% and changed slightly with varying the reaction conditions (entries 8–11). But the selectivity of PAP changed largely, it increased from 1.1% (at 0MPa CO2) to 62.0% (at 14MPa CO2) in the absence of catalyst and hydrogen via a Bamberger rearrangement of PHA (entries 8, 9), while the selectivity increased from zero (at 0MPa CO2) to 71.4% (at 14MPa CO2) in the presence of catalyst and hydrogen (entries 10, 11). The selectivity of PAP increased much larger in hydrogenation conditions with increasing CO2 pressure (entries 8–11), and the final selectivity to PAP was the same for both the hydrogenation of NB and PHA in 14MPa CO2-H2O (entries 6, 11), indicating carbonic acid produced from CO2 and H2O could catalyze the step of rearrangement of PHA to PAP, and the hydrogenation of NB to PHA was the rate-determining step. For the rearrangement of PHA in aqueous AcOH solution, the selectivity to PAP reached 75.3% (entry 12), but it was only 27.2% in the presence of Pt/Al2O3 and hydrogen (entry 13), indicating PHA could be transformed to other products under the hydrogenation conditions without CO2. While the selectivity increased to 71.2% in presence of CO2 (14MPa, Entry 14), which is higher than the case with the introduction of 0.5ml CO (50.2%, entry 15). It further confirmed that another factor should exist except for the acidity of system, CO was supposed to affect on the hydrogenation of PHA to PAP, which could be formed in situ from CO2 over the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst under hydrogenation conditions. The formation of CO was demonstrated by the in situ DRFTIR spectra. As shown in Fig. 6 a, in the environment of a mixture of 4MPa CO2 and 2MPa H2 at 140°C treated for 30min, Pt/Al2O3 presented a sharp absorbance peak at 2075cm−1 and two broad peaks at 2043 and 1821cm−1, which are similar to the sample treated with fresh CO gas (Fig. 6b). The former one is assigned to terminal CO bound on the Pt terrace sites, and the later one at 2043cm−1 is assigned to terminal CO bound on the low surface coordination of Pt, like edges, corners and kinks [68–70], the one at 1821cm−1 is assigned to bridged CO bound to Pt surface [69]. In addition, CO was also detected in the gas phase of the reaction product by TCD analysis (Fig. S5). These results indicated CO could be formed over Pt/Al2O3 in the presence of CO2 and H2, and in situ generated CO affect significantly on the hydrogenation of NB to PAP."
14,Phase behavior and reaction mechanism,"4.2 Phase behavior and reaction mechanism For the reaction in scCO2, the phase behavior is important in determining the reaction rate and product selectivity [71–73]. The phase behavior was observed for the reactant of NB and the intermediate of PHA under the similar conditions as used in reaction runs: 140°C, 1MPa H2, 0–14MPa CO2 (Fig. S3). NB is sparingly soluble (ca. 0.017M at 25°C) in H2O. In the presence of CTAB (0.5wt.%), the solubility of NB increased. For 0.05M NB, it can dissolve completely in H2O in the range of 0–14MPa CO2 (Fig. S3a). But for 0.2M NB, it can dissolve completely in H2O at CO2 pressure above 6MPa (Fig. S3b). PHA is soluble in H2O (ca.0.082M in saturated salt solution at 0°C [57]), but not soluble in CO2 in the range of 0–14MPa (Fig. S3c). The dissolution of CO2 may assist the amount of a gaseous reactant of H2 dissolved into H2O phase, enhancing the concentration of H2 in the reaction system, but under the over high pressure of CO2, the dilution effect may lower the mole fraction of H2 in H2O phase, resulting in a decrease in the conversion of NB. In the presence of CTAB (0.5wt.%), a transparent microemulsion was formed in a 0.05M aqueous NB solution (Fig. S3a). For 0.2M NB, the aqueous phase was transformed from turbidity to transparency with increasing CO2 pressure from 0 to 6MPa (Fig. S3b), indicating the droplet size in the microemulsion decreases with increasing CO2 pressure (Fig. 7 a) [60]. The smaller NB droplet can favor for the migration of PHA from NB phase to H2O phase due to PHA is soluble in H2O, resulting in the increase of the selectivity to PAP as the rearrangement of PHA occurred in H2O. Based on the experimental data, a possible reaction mechanism for the hydrogenation of NB to PAP over the Pt surface in scCO2-H2O was proposed and illustrated in Fig. 7b. CO could produce and adsorb on the low coordination of Pt sites in the hydrogenation of NB in the presence of CO2 [70]. The Pt sites in the edges, corners and kinks might be more effective for the hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds, through preferential adsorption of nitro groups on these low coordination Pt sites [69], and these low coordinated Pt sites may be more effective for the hydrogenation of PHA also. Thereby, in the presence of CO2, the low coordination Pt sites are occupied by the CO formed in situ, thus more and more Pt sites were occupied for the amount of CO increases with CO2 pressure, so the hydrogenation of NB to PHA, and PHA to AN was inhibited. In addition, the hydrogenation of NB to PHA is the rate-determining step (Table 3, entries 6–8), so the conversion of NB decreased with increasing of CO2 pressure (Fig. 5). On the other hand, the hydrogenation of PHA to AN and the rearrangement of PHA to PAP are competitive reactions, with increasing CO2 pressure, the hydrogenation of PHA to AN was inhibited, but the rearrangement of PHA to PAP was improved due to the increased acidity (Table 3, entries 10, 11), so the selectivity of PAP was enhanced with CO2 pressure."
15,Conclusions,"In a word, we have successfully developed a highly efficient catalytic system for the production of PAP from NB hydrogenation. With Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, PAP was produced with a high selectivity of 68.9% at a high NB conversion of 98.5% in scCO2-H2O system, which is comparative to the best results reported for the preparation of PAP from NB hydrogenation with liquid or solid strong acids. CO2 was confirmed to play a crucial role on the hydrogenation reaction, with increasing CO2 pressure, the migration of PHA from NB phase to H2O phase was accelerated due to the decrease of droplet size in the microemulsion, and the rearrangement of PHA to PAP was improved as the increased acidity of the system. Most importantly, CO generated in situ by the reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 +H2 →CO+H2O) selectively poisoned the Pt active sites, prohibited the deep hydrogenation of PHA to AN. The direct hydrogenation of NB to PHA is the rate-determining step, and the rearrangement of PHA to PAP and the hydrogenation of PHA to AN are competitive reactions, the rearrangement was accelerated but the hydrogenation was prohibited in scCO2-H2O, resulting in an increase of the selectivity of PAP. Thereby, a high yield of PAP (67.9%) was achieved over a simple and robust Pt/Al2O3 catalyst in scCO2-H2O."
