0,Introduction,"Nowadays, with the increasing cost of other energy resources and the depletion of fossil fuels, many of researches have been targeting the alternative energy resources. Carbon dioxide (CO2), the main cause of global warming, is considered as a potential energy resource for producing valuable chemicals such as hydrocarbon, formic acid and methanol [1–7]. Among those chemical resources, the methanol has many advantages because it is a stable liquid suitable for transportation and an eco-friendly chemical with no byproduct except H2O [8–11]. Despite essential necessity of hydrogen (H2) supply, CO2 to CH3OH (methanol) reaction is one of the promising reactions contributing to the CO2 recycling. Definitely, H2 is supplied by water electrolysis, a photochemical scission of water using solar energy, which does not generate any additional CO2 for H2 production. In Japan, Mitsui Chemicals Inc. built a pilot plant for methanol synthesis from CO2 and H2 with an annual capacity of more than 100 tons [10,11]. China, Australia and European Union also have shown a significant interest in this process because launching this CO2 recycling system at the end of fossil fuel based infra can help to reducing the CO2 emission [10,12]. According to IHS Corp., a worldwide demand for methanol was 49 million metric tons (MMT) in 2010 and it will surpass about 95 MMT in 2018 with china boosting more than 50 percent of world capacity [13]. To meet the universal methanol demand, many researches has been studied for commercial methanol production system. Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst is considered to be the most promising industrial catalyst in methanol synthesis [6,9,14–19]. Generally, using the catalyst, methanol is synthesized on an industrial scale from mixtures of CO/CO2/H2 (synthesis gas) at reaction conditions about 523 K and 50–120 bar [14,16–18]. Due to the harsh reducing atmosphere, CuO is fully reduced to Cu0 by the H2 activation and experimentally, the TPR reduction peaks of CuOx are detected at T = 473 K and 558 K [20–22]. Also, Topsøe et al., reported that when comparing methanol yield between pure Cu and Cu/ZnO, the latter showed more than 5 times higher productivity [18]. That is, it is obvious that not only Cu has an important role of active metal but also Zn species helps the catalysis. Therefore, recent studies are targeting to reveal the role of Zn species in Cu/ZnO catalyst [14,15,23–25]. Especially, Kuld et al. reported that the amount of reduced Zn atoms from ZnO migrated into Cu nanoparticle shows proportional relation with methanol activity leading to almost 3 times higher methanol TOF with Zn coverage of 0.5 (reduced under 40 bar H2, 280 °C) than 0.05 (reduced under 0.01 bar H2, 220 °C) [24]. Not only the experimental results, but also DFT calculation reports have proved excellent activities of Cu/Zn catalyst in CO2 to methanol conversion [9,15,16,23,25–27]. The literatures commonly show an improved energy diagram of Cu/Zn than pure Cu model. However, the exact rate determining steps for the reaction is still controversial according to the calculation literatures. In studying Cu/Zn catalyst, an exposed facet is also important. A terraced surface, (1 1 1) facet, has coordination number of nine leading to relatively adverse bonding nature participating covalent bond [28]. Meanwhile, a stepped (2 1 1) surface, which has a lower coordination number (seven) and is commonly known as defect site, forms a stronger bond with adsorbates [28]. Generally, the stepped surface shows enhanced catalytic performance compared to terraced one due to the intensive cohesion achieved by free dangling bonds [15,28–31]. In methanol synthesis, the role of (2 1 1) facet in catalysis is especially crucial because the activity highly depends on the stacking fault ratio. According to the experimental results of Behrens et al., when the stacking fault (including stepped and kinked surface) probability becomes 2% of overall catalytic surface (terrace), then the intrinsic activity increases two times as much as that with only terraced case [15]. Accordingly, the role of defect sites, in spite of their low proportion, should not be ignored to measure activities in methanol synthesis. However, the stepped surface is known to be thermodynamically unstable than terraced one, which may cause the wearing-out problems of surface atoms. When one stepped atom is lost, the structure becomes kinked surface with coordination number of six. Until now, the role of kinked surface on catalytic activity in CH3OH production has not been reported. In this study, we investigate the effect of different defected Cu sites in Cu/ZnO catalysts in determining the CH3OH production by CO2 hydrogenation and dissociation and. To this end, we create three different defected surface models [such as the step, kink and Zn-substituted step in Cu(2 1 1) slab] and evaluate the stability and reaction mechanism of defected surface sites by using a spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Then, we perform the microkinetic modeling with the calculated kinetic data, which leads to the clear understanding on the superior ability of a single Zn atom in stepped surface to boost the catalysis of CH3OH production compared to other defected sites. Finally, we present how the existence of Zn atom in Cu(2 1 1) surface modifies the surface electronic structure and in turn the bonding nature between surface and reaction intermediate."
1,Theoretical detail,"Each calculation was performed on the basis of spin-polarized density functional theory within the Perdew and Wang’s 1991 functional (PW91), as implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [32,33]. The projector augmented wave (PAW) method with a plane wave basis set was accepted to describe the interaction between ion cores and valence electrons [34]. The kinetic energy cutoff of 350 eV was set for the expansion of the electronic wavefunctions (Here, we checked the convergence of energy calculation by varying the energy cutoffs and found that the energy cutoff of 350 eV is the reasonable value for understanding the methanol synthesis catalysis). To uncover the effect of defective Cu surfaces on the methanol synthesis, we constructed four different surfaces (see Fig. 1 ); (1) a terraced 2 × 2 hexagonal (1 1 1) surface unit cell with five atomic layers [indicated by Cu(1 1 1)terrace], (2) a stepped 2 × 3 hexagonal (2 1 1) surface unit cell with three atomic layers [Cu(2 1 1)step], (3) a kinked 2 × 3 hexagonal (2 1 1) surface unit cell with three atomic layers (contain a sixfold-coordinated Cu site) where a single Cu atom is removed along the sevenfold-coordinated stepped site [Cu(2 1 1)kink], (4) a single Zn atom in the sevenfold-coordinated stepped 2 × 3 hexagonal (2 1 1) surface unit cell (with nine atomic layers) where a sixfold-coordinated kink site is occupied by a single Zn atom [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step], resulting in the formation of Cu-Zn surface alloy at the stepped Cu(2 1 1) site. While the bottom two (one) layers of the five (three)-layered slab are fixed at the corresponding bulk lattice constant of Cu system, the upper three (or two) layers are fully relaxed using the conjugate gradient method until residual forces on each constituent atom became smaller than 5 × 10−2 eV/Å [35]. Here, the lattice constant of bulk Cu is calculated to be 3.64 Å, which is in good agreement with the experimental value (3.61 Å) [36]. For the Brillouin zone interaction, we used a (3 × 5 × 1) [(5 × 5 × 1)] Monkhorst-Pack mesh of k points for the 2 × 3 hexagonal (2 1 1) [2 × 2 hexagonal (1 1 1)] slab to determine the optimal geometries and total energies of catalytic systems. For the electronic structure calculation, we increased the k point mesh to (12 × 12 × 1). We also performed Bader charge analysis to understand the behavior of electronic charge transfer between atoms in model slabs. The cohesive energy of a single surface atom in model slabs (denoted as Ecoh) was calculated by the following equation. (1) E coh = E defected + E isolated - E perfect where Edefected, Eisolated, and Eperfect is the total energy of the slab having a single defective surface site, the isolated atom and the defect-free slab, respectively. Here, Ecoh exhibits the energy required for separating a surface atom in solid into an isolated atom, which represents the degree of stability of a single Zn (or Cu) atom at catalyst surface. The structures of transition state were identified using the climbing-image nudged elastic band method (c-NEBM) with six intermediate images for each elementary step, which leads to the determination of reaction barriers [37]. Note that our calculation exhibited only one imaginary frequency at all transition state configurations. The adsorption energy (Eads) of a species I on the surface of model slabs are calculated by using Eads = EI * − (Ebare + EI), where EI * and Ebare are the total energies of the surface with and without the adsorbed I species, respectively, and EI is the total energy of the species I in the vacuum. The Gibbs free energy of reaction (including activation barriers) on the model surfaces was calculated by using ΔG = ΔHDFT + ΔZPE − TΔS (where ΔHDFT, ΔZPE, T and ΔS is the reaction energy obtained from DFT calculation, zero-point energy of reaction, reaction temperature, and reaction entropy, respectively. (See the supporting materials for the detail calculation procedures of these thermodynamic variables). For the better understanding of the nature of the catalysis of methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation, we conducted a microkinetic modeling under the normal synthesis condition of 523 K and 75 bar with the calculated rate constant for each elementary reaction, Gibbs free energy and entropy (see the supporting information for a developed microkinetic model)."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Stability of a single Zn atom in the stepped Cu surface,"3.1 Stability of a single Zn atom in the stepped Cu surface In a recent study, Sebastian et al. have reported that the reaction-induced structural change of the Cu particle supported on ZnO (indicated by Cu/ZnO), in particular, the formation of Zn-substituted Cu sites (so-called Cu-Zn surface alloy) at the surface of Cu nanoparticle, may be responsible for the enhanced methanol production from CO2 and H2 [24]. Moreover, such in-situ surface transformation of the Cu/ZnO catalyst into the Cu-Zn surface alloy can be more likely occurred in the defective stepped Cu(2 1 1) sites, rather than the terraced Cu(1 1 1) sites. To investigate the possibility of such formation of Cu-Zn surface alloy in Cu sites, we first calculate the surface cohesive energy (denoted as Ecoh) of a Cu atom for the terraced Cu(1 1 1) and stepped Cu(2 1 1) surfaces (see Table 1 ). We find the higher Ecoh in the terraced Cu(1 1 1) surface by 0.44 eV than the stepped Cu(2 1 1) case. This indicates more favorable generation of the Cu vacant sites (which is corresponding to the sixfold-coordinated kinked site) in the Cu(2 1 1)step surface and in turn the higher chance of the formation of Cu-Zn surface alloy than the Cu(1 1 1)terrace case. This is also supported by the endothermic energy change for the migration of a Zn atom in the stepped Cu(2 1 1)step site toward the 1st near-neighbor (1 1 1) for +0.07 eV and (1 0 0) sites for +0.15 eV in the Cu(2 1 1) surface (see Fig. S2 the supporting information section). Thus, from now on, we will focus on the Cu-Zn alloy on the surface of Cu(2 1 1)step in understanding the impact of Zn-related surface modification in methanol synthesis. The starting point for the study on the catalysis of Cu-Zn alloy on the Cu(2 1 1)step surface is how the Cu and Zn atoms are distributed on the (2 1 1) step site. For such purpose, we examine the stability of different Zn atom arrangements at the Cu(2 1 1)step site by calculating the relative formation energy (denoted as Ef) of different Zn arrangements such as a single Zn atom (which is surrounded by neighboring Cu atoms), Zn dimer (where two consecutive Zn atoms are surrounded by neighboring Cu atoms) and Zn trimer (three linear Zn atoms are surrounded by neighboring Cu atoms) in the Cu(2 1 1)step surface (see Fig. 2 ). Here, Ef is estimated by [ECuZn − ECu + NZn(ECu-bulk − EZn-bulk)]/NZn, where ECuZn, ECu, ECu-bulk, and EZn-bulk represent the total energies of Cu(2 1 1)Zn-step slab, Cu slab, bulk Cu (per atom), and bulk Zn (per atom), respectively, and NZn displays the number of Zn atoms in a given Cu(2 1 1)Zn-step surface layer. This investigation on the stability of atom arrangement is important since the most probable Zn atom arrangement may be responsible for determining the catalysis of CH3OH synthesis. To further support the high stability of the single Zn atom, we additionally calculate the energetic difference between various Zn ensembles at the same Zn coverage. Here, the Zn coverages of 0.11 and 0.17 are studied. As shown in Fig. 3 , the isolated Zn atom is found to be the most stable compared to the clustered Zn ensembles (dimer, and trimer). Our DFT calculation predicts the lowest Ef for a single Zn atom in stepped Cu surface [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] in different Zn arrangements, suggesting that a single Zn atom in Cu(2 1 1)Zn-step is likely to be more thermodynamically favored compared to Zn dimer and Zn trimer. In addition, for a single Zn atom, we find the substantial increase of surface cohesive energy [Ecoh = 0.74 eV for Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] compared to a single Cu atom site in the Cu(2 1 1)step [Ecoh = 0.24 eV] surface. This suggests that the presence of a single Zn atom at surface can enhance the stability about the loss of surface atoms at catalytic reaction conditions over the pure surface Cu site. Next, we will display how a single Zn atom in the stepped Cu site [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] greatly enhance the catalysis of methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation and dissociation over the ninefold-coordinated Cu(1 1 1)terrace, sevenfold-coordinated Cu(2 1 1)step and sixfold-coordinated Cu(2 1 1)kink in detail."
4,Adsorption of reaction intermediates in the defective Cu surfaces,"3.2 Adsorption of reaction intermediates in the defective Cu surfaces Table 2 and Fig. S5 exhibit the adsorption energy (Eads), adsorption structures (adsorbate configuration and adsorbate-metal distance) at the most favorable adsorption site for all reaction intermediates identified during the CH3OH synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation and dissociation at the step [Cu(2 1 1)step], kink [Cu(2 1 1)step] and Zn-substituted stepped Cu [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] sites. For comparison, the pure terraced Cu(1 1 1) case is also shown. We classified the whole reaction intermediates into two groups; (1) Cu and (2) Zn favor group according to the favorable adsorption site on Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step. 3.2.1 Cu-favor group Carbon dioxide (CO2). For the gas-phase CO2, the calculated CO bond distance is 1.18 Å which is very close with experimental result (1.16 Å) [38]. CO2 is horizontally adsorbed at the terraced surface, while for the stepped cases the molecular axis of O-C-O is parallel to undercoordinated surface atoms with the Eads of −0.09 to 0.00 eV. The significant energy difference is not observed due to the physisorption. Carbon monoxide (CO). CO is favorably adsorbed on the threefold fcc (face-centered cubic) site [bridge, top, bridge], forming the CuC bond on the Cu(1 1 1)terrace surfaces [Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink, Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step]. The stepped surfaces show the stronger Eads by 0.22–0.42 eV than the terraced case. Carboxylate (COOH). COOH is adsorbed at the bridge site by the formation of CCu bond and H in COOH points down toward surface regardless of its facet. The calculated Eads on the Cu(1 1 1)terrace, Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surfaces are −1.81 eV, −2.35 eV, −2.29 eV and −2.50 eV, which is higher than the HCOO case, −2.71 eV, −3.56 eV, −3.58 eV and −3.72 eV. Since COOH and HCOO are competitive intermediates in CO2 hydrogenation, the COOH is the unstable intermediate for Cu-based catalyst. Formic acid (HCOOH). For all surface models, HCOOH is physically adsorbed at the surface atoms with the interaction of H in OH and O in HCO [39] with the Eads of −0.15 eV to −0.72 eV. For the Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step cases, our DFT calculation shows that the O in HCO is strongly connected with the under-coordinated Cu sites, while the H in OH is weakly interacted with surface atoms. H2COOH. Many of previous researches have reported that H2COOH is a crucial intermediate to form HCHO intermediate via the H2COOH → HCHO + OH route [15,23,26,40]. The configuration of H2COOH is similar to the HCOOH case, except that the H in OH group point in parallel with surface. The Eads on the terraced surface is the highest for −2.02 eV followed by the kinked (−2.55 eV), stepped (−2.76 eV) and Zn-stepped surface (−2.85 eV). Formyl (HCO). HCO is generated by the dissociation of HCOOH or hydrogenation of CO. According to the previous studies, CO should be converted to HCO for the production of CH3OH since COH (a byproduct) is well known for methanation intermediate [16,41,42]. HCO binds at the top site for the Cu(1 1 1)terrace, Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step cases by the formation of CCu bond formation and their adsorption energies (Eads) are calculated to be −2.31 eV, −2.75 eV, −2.87 eV and −2.76 eV, respectively. Hydroxymethylidyne (COH). COH has an important role in the methanation reaction (the scission of COH bond can lead to the formation of C atom and in turn CH4 production by C hydrogenation). The C atom of COH mainly binds to the surface atom since the O in OH is connected with the top of C atom. Eads of COH are predicted to be −3.87 eV [Cu(1 1 1)terrace], −3.95 eV [Cu(2 1 1)step], −4.03 eV [Cu(2 1 1)kink] and −4.20 eV [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step]. Methanol (CH3OH). The OH group in CH3OH binds to the surface atom and CH3 group points toward vacuum space. CH3OH on the terraced surface prefers the adsorption at the hcp site, while the stepped, kinked cases tend to be adsorbed at the bridge site. Like the previous gaseous molecule such as HCOOH and CO2, the very weak binding energies are observed for the Cu(1 1 1)terrace [Eads = −0.13 eV], Cu(2 1 1)step [−0.56 eV], Cu(2 1 1)kink [−0.47 eV] and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step [−0.76 eV]. Hydrogen (H). H is continuously supplied by the H2(g) → 2H reaction in Cu-based catalysts. H is favorably adsorbed at the fcc site for the Cu(1 1 1)terrace surface, while for the kinked, and stepped surfaces, H is selectively stabilized at the h2 site (avoiding Zn atoms). Eads on the terraced surface is the highest value of −2.39 eV, followed by kinked (−2.51 eV), stepped (−2.60 eV) and Zn-stepped surface (−2.63 eV). 3.2.2 Zn-favor group Hydroxyl group (OH). OH is favorably adsorbed at the bridge site for the Cu(1 1 1)terrace, Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surfaces with the Eads = −3.07 eV, −3.79 eV, −3.72 eV and −3.80 eV, respectively. This indicates the higher affinity of OH for the stepped cases than the terraced case. Formate (HCOO). For all the surface models, HCOO is adsorbed at the top-bridge-top site (a bidentate configuration) where two oxygen moieties bind at the surface atoms and the H in CH group points toward vacuum space. Eads of HCOO are calculated to be −2.71 eV [Cu(1 1 1)terrace], −3.56 eV [Cu(2 1 1)step], −3.58 eV [Cu(2 1 1)kink] and −3.72 eV[Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step]. Formaldehyde (HCHO). HCHO has the symmetric structure around the molecular C-O axis and is found to have the in-plane adsorption of C-O axis [15,16,26,43]. HCHO on the Cu(1 1 1)terrace, Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surfaces exhibits the physisorption behavior with the Eads of −0.06 eV, −0.22 eV, −0.43 eV and −0.75 eV, respectively. Methoxy group (CH3O). The O moiety in CH3O is adsorbed at the surface atoms and the CH3 group points toward the empty space. The favorable adsorption sites are predicted to the fcc [bridge, bridge, Zn-bridge] for the Cu(1 1 1)terrace case [Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink, Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] with Eads = −2.18 eV [−2.93 eV, −2.74 eV, −3.17 eV]. Water (H2O). H2O is weakly adsorbed at the surface of Cu(1 1 1)terrace, Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step slabs with Eads = −0.14 eV, −0.18 eV, −0.49 eV and −0.30 eV. Oxygen (O). Eads of O for the Cu(1 1 1)terrace, Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step cases are calculated to be −5.06 eV, −5.49 eV, −5.36 eV and −5.53 eV, respectively."
5,Reaction mechanism of CH3OH synthesis in the defective Cu surfaces,"3.3 Reaction mechanism of CH3OH synthesis in the defective Cu surfaces Fig. 4 displays the reaction pathways of CH3OH synthesis from CO2 and H2 [CO2(g) + H2(g) → CH3OH(g) + H2O(g)] on the terraced and defected Cu surfaces we have considered in this study. As proposed in previous theoretical works, CH3OH is produced by two successive hydrogenations of HCHO (formaldehyde), which is a key intermediate formed by the hydrogenation/dissociation of CO2 via two different HCOO (formate) and COOH (hydrocarboxyl) formation routes [15,16,23,26,43,44]. Here, we assume that the surface reactions of CO2 hydrogenation and dissociation follow the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism since the H2 dissociation is relatively ease at typical CH3OH synthesis condition [45]. The detailed reaction steps for CH3OH synthesis are presented in the following paragraph. First, looking at the HCHO formation via the HCOO route, the CO2 is firstly hydrogenated to HCOO [(1-H) CO2 + H → HCOO], followed by the hydrogenation of HCOO to form the formic acid (HCOOH) [(2-H) HCOO + H → HCOOH]. The HCOOH can undergo the hydrogenation into H2COOH [(3-H) HCOOH + H → H2COOH]. Here, the HCOOH hydrogenation is competed with the dissociation of HCOOH to HCO (formyl) and OH (hydroxyl) [(3-D) HCOOH → HCO + OH]. Next, the HCHO is formed via the C—O bond scission of H2COOH [(4-D) H2COOH → HCHO + OH]. For the HCHO formation via the COOH route, the COOH formed by the CO2 hydrogenation [(5-H) CO2 + H → COOH] is dissociated into CO and OH [(6-D) COOH → CO + OH]. After that, the CO is further hydrogenated to HCO (formyl) [(7-H) CO + H → HCO] or COH (alcohol) [(8-H) CO + H → COH], followed by the hydrogenation of HCO or COH, yielding the HCHO intermediate [(9-H) HCO + H → HCHO] or [(10-H) COH + H → HCHO]. Next, the HCHO, whose is the common intermediate from CO2 hydrogenation via both HCOO and COOH formation paths, goes through two successive hydrogenations, [(11-H) HCHO + H → CH3O], [(12-H) CH3O + H → CH3OH] and desorption process [(13) CH3OH → CH3OH(g)], leading to the liberation of CH3OH off the surface of catalyst. Finally, OH (which is the by-product of CO2 hydrogenation and dissociation) is eliminated by the hydrogenation ([14] OH + H → H2O) and desorption ([15] H2O → H2O(g)) as the form of gaseous H2O from the surface. Table 3 summarizes the predicted free energy changes (ΔG) and activation barriers (Ga) for the elementary reaction steps of CH3OH synthesis by the CO2 hydrogenation and dissociation via the HCOO or COOH routes on the Cu(1 1 1)terrace, Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink, and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surfaces at T = 523 K. The potential energy diagrams [indicated by PED] are also shown in Figs. 5–8 . Our DFT calculation clearly displays that the catalytic activity toward the CH3OH production by CO2 hydrogenation and dissociation is significantly affected by the nature of defects. In particular, a Zn-substituted stepped Cu(2 1 1) defect [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] shows the highest catalytic activity toward CH3OH synthesis compared to other defects [Cu(2 1 1)step and Cu(2 1 1)kink] and terraced surface [Cu(1 1 1)terrace]. Next, we will present the role of Zn-modified Cu site in such enhanced catalysis in detail. 3.3.1 HCHO formation via HCOO route First, CO2 is calculated to exothermically bind to four different surfaces [Cu(1 1 1)terrace, Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] with the range of reaction energy between −0.28 eV and −0.49 eV (see Fig. 5 and Table 3), indicating that the CO2 adsorption takes places spontaneously in the terraced and defected Cu surfaces. For the CO2 hydrogenation to HCOO by the C—H bond formation [(1-H) CO2 + H → HCOO], we find that the defective surface sites (step, kink and Zn-substituted step) greatly reduce the activation energy barriers by 1.06 eV [Cu(2 1 1)step], 1.45 eV [Cu(2 1 1)kink] and 1.82 eV [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] compared to the Cu(1 1 1)terrace case. The increase of energy barrier in CO2 to HCOO at Zn substituted surface is good agreement with previous results [15,25]. This result suggests that the defective sites (especially, Zn-modified surface) are essential for substantially enhancing the HCOO formation via the C—H formation from CO2. For the following second hydrogenation of HCOO to HCOOH by the O—H bond formation [(2-H) HCOO + H → HCOOH], our DFT calculation predicts that the barrier for the Cu(2 1 1)step surface [Ga = 0.95 eV] is virtually the same as the pure Cu(1 1 1)terrace case [Ga = 0.96 eV], while for the Cu(2 1 1)kink [Ga = 1.80 eV] and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step [Ga = 1.30 eV] surfaces, the reaction barriers are substantially increased compared to the pure Cu(1 1 1)terrace case. Although the activity of the Cu(2 1 1)kink and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surfaces toward the HCOO + H → HCOOH seems to be reduced compared to the Cu(2 1 1)step and Cu(1 1 1)terrace cases, those surface sites can still maintain the higher catalytic performance in CO2 reduction to CH3OH than the Cu(2 1 1)step and Cu(1 1 1)terrace cases because of the lower barriers in the prior CO2 + H → HCOO reactions. Next, the formed HCOOH can undergo the hydrogenation [(3-H) HCOOH + H → H2COOH] or dissociation [(3-D) HCOOH → HCO + OH] reaction. Our DFT calculation predicts that for the Cu(1 1 1)terrace, Cu(2 1 1)step, and Cu(2 1 1)kink surfaces the HCOOH hydrogenation has substantially lower activation energy barriers (Ga = 1.22 eV [Cu(1 1 1)terrace], 0.97 eV [Cu(2 1 1)step] and 1.14 eV [Cu(2 1 1)kink]) than the HCOOH dissociation (Ga = 1.57 eV [Cu(1 1 1)terrace], 1.71 eV [Cu(2 1 1)step] and 1.48 eV [Cu(2 1 1)kink]). On the other hand, for the Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surface, the HCOOH hydrogenation and dissociation reactions are found to compete with each other owing to the similar reaction barriers for the hydrogenation (Ga = 1.28 eV) and dissociation barrier (Ga = 1.26 eV). Looking at the (4-D) H2COOH → HCHO + OH reaction, the barriers for the Cu(2 1 1)step [Ga = 0.62 eV], Cu(2 1 1)kink [Ga = 0.59 eV], and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step [Ga = 0.83 eV] surfaces are greatly decreased compared to the Cu(1 1 1)terrace case [Ga = 1.28 eV]. This indicates the higher ability to break down the C—O bond of H2COOH at the defected sites than the Cu(1 1 1) surface. 3.3.2 HCOH formation via COOH route In this route, the adsorbed CO2 is hydrogenated to COOH [(5-H) CO2 + H → COOH] by the O—H bond formation in which a carbon atom is bonded to the top site of surface Cu atom. Here, the preferred bond making between the O moiety of CO2 and the H atom, rather than the C—H bond formation, is key to the production of COOH. First, compared to the (1-H) CO2 + H → HCOO reaction, we find the lower activation barriers in (5-H) CO2 + H → COOH for the Cu(1 1 1)terrace and Cu(2 1 1)step surfaces by 0.95 eV and 0.07 eV, respectively. On the other hand, for the Cu(2 1 1)kink and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surfaces, the HCOO formation channel is found to be kinetically more preferable than the COOH formation channel. Note the amount of the barrier reduction in (1-H) CO2 + H → HCOO by 0.20 eV [Cu(2 1 1)kink], and 0.38 eV [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] over (5-H) CO2 + H → COOH. Second, looking closely at the catalytic activity difference of model surfaces in the (5-H) CO2 + H → COOH reaction, the barriers in defective surfaces (1.76 eV [Cu(2 1 1)step], 1.64 eV [Cu(2 1 1)kink], 1.45 eV [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] are substantially reduced compared to the Cu(1 1 1)terrace surface (1.94 eV) (See Fig. 6 and Table 3). In particular, the Zn-substituted Cu(2 1 1) step site [a single Zn atom in Cu(2 1 1) step] exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward the COOH formation over step and kink sites. For the (6-D) COOH → CO + OH reaction (the formation of CO and OH by the breaking of C—O bond in COOH), the reaction barriers for defected sites are found to raise by 0.33 eV [Cu(2 1 1)step], 0.18 eV [Cu(2 1 1)kink], and 0.59 eV [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] compared to the Cu(1 1 1)terrace case. However, the amount of increased barriers in defected sites are not enough to slow down the overall CH3OH production since the prior CO2 + H → COOH reaction still have the considerably higher barriers in all surface models than the COOH → CO + OH reaction. Next, for the CO hydrogenation to HCO by the C—H bond formation [(7-H) CO + H → HCO] or COH by the O—H bond formation [(8-H) CO + H → COH] on all Cu(1 1 1)terrace, Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink, and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surfaces, we first see that the formation reaction of HCO occurs more rapidly than the COH formation case. Note the strikingly reduced activation energy barriers (1.05–1.21 eV) in the (7-H) CO + H → HCO reaction in comparison with the (8-H) CO + H → COH case (2.60–2.95 eV). Second, for the kinetically favored HCO formation reaction, we find the small variation of barriers for the Cu(1 1 1)terrace [Ga = 1.17 eV], Cu(2 1 1)step [Ga = 1.05 eV], Cu(2 1 1)kink [Ga = 1.13 eV], and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step [Ga = 1.21 eV] surfaces. Taking a look at the (9-H) HCO + H → HCHO reaction, the Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step barriers for the defected surfaces are slightly decreased by 0.18 eV [Cu(2 1 1)step], 0.02 eV [Cu(2 1 1)kink] and 0.08 eV [Cu(2 1 1)Zn-step] compared to the Cu(1 1 1)terrace case, implying that the defective Cu and Zn-modified Cu surfaces make the formation of O—H bond more favorable than the Cu(1 1 1)terrace surface. 3.3.3 CH3OH production from HCHO In Fig. 7(a), the potential energy diagram for the gas state CH3OH production via the successive hydrogenations of HCHO [(11-H) HCHO + H → CH3O, (12-H) CH3O + H → CH3OH] and desorption of CH3OH [(13) CH3OH → CH3OH(g)] is displayed. For the (11-H) HCHO + H → CH3O reaction, we find that the reaction barriers for the step, kink and Zn-substituted step sites are found to be lowered in the order of Cu(2 1 1)kink [Ga = 0.24 eV] > Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step [Ga = 0.32 eV] >> Cu(2 1 1)step [Ga = 0.73 eV] compared to Cu(1 1 1)terrace case [Ga = 0.79 eV], which indicates the enhanced kinetics of the C—H bond formation in HCOH on defected sites. For the subsequent (12-H) CH3O + H → CH3OH reaction, the defected surfaces make the O—H bond formation in CH3O more sluggish than the Cu(1 1 1)terrace surface. In particular, the kinetic hindrance is the largest in the Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surface, leading to the change of the rate-determining step (RDS) from the initial CO2 hydrogenation to CH3O hydrogenation (we will discuss this point in later section in detail). Notice the increased reaction barriers for the CH3O hydrogenation at defected sites: 1.07 eV for Cu(1 1 1)terrace, 1.54 eV for Cu(2 1 1)step, 1.08 eV for Cu(2 1 1)kink, and 1.66 eV for Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step. For the (13) CH3OH → CH3OH(g) (desorption), our DFT calculation shows the endothermic energy changes (+0.52 eV to 1.09 eV) for all surface models. 3.3.4 H2O formation from OH and H During CO2 hydrogenation and dissociation, the OH radicals are formed by the different side reactions and may be accumulated at catalyst surface. Unless those are properly eliminated from surface, this can block the active sites for CH3OH production and in turn degrade the catalytic activity. One plausible reaction path for removing those species from surface is the OH hydrogenation to gaseous H2O. Fig. 8(b) displays the potential energy diagram for the (14-H) OH + H → H2O and (15) H2O → H2O(g) reactions for the Cu(1 1 1)terrace, Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink, and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surfaces. First, taking a look at the (14-H) OH + H → H2O reaction, the barriers for defective surfaces are substantially increased by 0.42 eV [Cu(2 1 1)step], 0.79 eV [Cu(2 1 1)kink], and 0.39 eV [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] compared to the Cu(1 1 1)terrace surface, suggesting that the OH elimination reaction from surface tends to be suppressed at defective sites and may determine the overall reaction rate for the CH3OH synthesis. However, comparing the barriers in each reaction step observed in the CH3OH synthesis in defective surfaces (see Table 2), the overall CH3OH production rate at the only kinked surface is found to be significantly retarded by the OH + H → H2O reaction. This can be explained by the quantitative understanding of the interaction energy between OH and H at the coadsorbed state. Hereafter, the interaction energy caused by forming the coadsorbed state from the fully separated state is denoted by the proximity energy (ΔGPE) (note that the positive ΔGPE indicates the repulsive interaction, while for the negative ΔGPE the opposite is true). Fig. 8(b) shows the PES in OH hydrogenation (including the proximity energy) for the Cu(2 1 1)step, and Cu(2 1 1)kink cases. We see the strikingly higher positive proximity energy (ΔGPE = 0.38 eV, repulsive interaction) for the kinked Cu(2 1 1)kink surface than Cu(2 1 1)step case (ΔGPE = −0.22 eV, attractive interaction), implying the considerably higher activation energy barrier for the OH + H → H2O reaction in the kinked Cu(2 1 1)kink surface than the Cu(2 1 1)step surface. The high repulsive interaction in kinked Cu(2 1 1)kink surface may be related to the insufficient surface sites for coadsorption. As depicted in Fig. 8(a), the kinked Cu(2 1 1)kink surface has a Cu vacant site, which may hinder the anchoring of the H atom in the proximity of preadsorbed OH and in turn increase the level of repulsive interaction. The similar trend is also observed in other hydrogenation reaction such as HCOO + H → HCOOH. Notice the higher barrier in the kinked Cu(2 1 1)kink surface in comparison with the Cu(2 1 1)step case by means of the substantial increase of proximity energy in the kinked Cu(2 1 1)kink surface. For the next (15) reaction, we find the significantly higher endothermicity (+0.29 eV to 0.86 eV) for pure Cu surface and lower change (+0.02 eV) for Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step, which shows that H2O removal is favorably occurred in Cu-Zn surface but, not in Cu surface. Especially, in kinked surface, the formation and desorption energy of H2O are the highest for +1.90 and +0.86 eV indicating poor OH conversion. 3.3.5 The most preferred reaction path in CH3OH production Fig. 9 exhibits the kinetically-preferred PED of CH3OH production from CO2 hydrogenation and dissociation for the Cu(1 1 1)terrace, Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink, and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surfaces. First, the Cu(1 1 1)terrace and Cu(2 1 1)step surfaces are found to have the same sequence of reaction paths; that is, the CH3OH production via COOH route[CO2(g) → COOH → CO → HCO → HCHO → CH3O → CH3OH(g)]. On the other hand, the Cu(2 1 1)kink, and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surfaces are predicted to follow the HCOO route for the HCHO and CH3OH formation with the slight difference of HCOOH reaction step. Notice that the most favorable reaction path for the Cu(2 1 1)kink and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step cases are CO2(g) → HCOO → HCOOH → H2COOH → HCHO → CH3O → CH3OH(g) and CO2(g) → HCOO → HCOOH → HCO → HCHO → CH3O → CH3OH(g), respectively. Next, we attempt to identify the slowest reaction step to limit the whole CH3OH production rate [the rate determining steps (RDS)]. For the Cu(1 1 1)terrace and Cu(2 1 1)step surfaces, the [(5-H) CO2 + H → COOH] reaction (the initial CO2 hydrogenation to COOH) is found to be the RDS with the barrier of 1.94 eV and 1.76 eV, respectively. In contrast, the RDSs for the Cu(2 1 1)kink and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surfaces shift from CO2 hydrogenation to OH hydrogenation [(14) OH + H → H2O] and CH3O hydrogenation [(13) CH3O + H → CH3OH], respectively. Here, the activation energy barriers in RDS for the Cu(2 1 1)kink and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step are calculated to be 1.90 eV and 1.66 eV, respectively. The above analysis on the favorable PED and RDS indicates that the Zn-substituted stepped surface [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] displays the highest catalytic activity toward CH3OH production, followed by the stepped surface[Cu(2 1 1)step](which has been known to be good active site for CH3OH synthesis). In contrast, the activity of the kinked surface [Cu(2 1 1)kink] is decreased compared to the Cu(2 1 1)step case and close to the non-defective Cu(1 1 1)terrace surface. The result clearly demonstrates that the subtle control on the existence of surface defects in Cu-based systems is a key factor to enhance the catalysis of CH3OH synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation and dissociation. Especially, reducing the number of the kinked sites by adding a single Zn atom into the vacant lattice site in Cu(2 1 1) step is needed for maximizing the productivity of CH3OH."
6,Microkinetic modeling,"3.4 Microkinetic modeling To clearly understand the different kinetics of the CO2(g) + H2(g) → CH3OH(g) + H2O(g) reaction on the model surfaces we have considered in this study, a microkinetic modeling has been performed by predicting Gibbs free energy, entropy, zero point energy and rate constant for each elementary reaction (see the supporting information section for the detail microkineitc model, entropy, and zero point energy) [46]. Here, we consider twelve elementary steps and two equilibrium adsorption process of CO2 and H2 molecules to explain the overall CH3OH production reaction from CO2 and H2 (see Table S1). Tables 4 and S4 displays the calculated prefactors (referred to A), rate constants (k) and turnover frequencies (TOF) of CH3OH production for the Cu(1 1 1)terrace, Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink, and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surfaces at a typical experimental condition of P = 75 bar (90% H2, 10% CO2) and T = 523 K. First, for the Cu(1 1 1)terrace and Cu(2 1 1)step cases, we find the smallest value of rate constants [7.8 × 10−9 s−1 and 3.1 × 10−5 s−1, respectively] in the (5-H) CO2 + H → COOH step among the reaction paths considered, indicating that the CO2 + H → COOH as RDS limits the overall CH3OH production. On the other hand, the RDS for the Cu(2 1 1)kink, and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surfaces are found to be the (14) OH + H → H2O (k = 1.5 × 10−9 s−1) and (13) CH3O + H → CH3OH (k = 7.4 × 10−4 s−1) steps, respectively. The prediction for RDS is consistent with the reaction step (having the highest energy state) identified in the total potential energy diagram (see Fig. 9). Second, our microkinetic modeling shows the highest TOF of 3.07 × 10−5 s−1 for the CH3OH formation in the Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surface, followed by Cu(2 1 1)step [2.73 × 10−7 s−1], Cu(1 1 1)terrace [1.56 × 10−9 s−1] and Cu(2 1 1)kink [3.34 × 10−15 s−1]. This reveals that the addition of a single Zn atom to a Cu vacant site [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] can significantly contribute to the enhancement of CH3OH production, whereas the existence of a Cu vacant site [Cu(2 1 1)kink] tends to hinder the kinetic of CH3OH production. Although the calculated activities are not exactly matched with some of experimental reports such as reported by J. Yoshihara et al., P. B. Rasmussen et al. for 1.0 × 10−6 s−1 to 2.7 × 10−4 s−1 per site over Cu and Malte Berhen et al. for 2.1 × 10−2 s−1 per site over Cu/ZnO, a same tendency of high activity in Cu/Zn alloy is still observed in our calculational results [15,47,48]. Next, we present the effect of different Zn ensembles in determining the catalysis of CH3OH production."
7,Effect of Zn atomic arrangements on the CH3OH production,"3.5 Effect of Zn atomic arrangements on the CH3OH production Table S9 and Fig. 10 shows the reaction energetics and barriers in each reaction step on the different Zn ensembles in the stepped Cu(2 1 1) slab for the CH3OH production from CO2 hydrogenation and dissociation. Here, we considered three different Zn ensembles such as a single Zn atom [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step], Zn dimer[Cu(2 1 1)dimer-Zn-step] and Zn linear trimer-like ensemble [Cu(2 1 1)linear-Zn-step]. We see that the catalysis of CH3OH synthesis strongly depends on the Zn atomic arrangements in the stepped Cu(2 1 1)step site. In particular, the singe Zn atom exhibits the different catalytic activity toward the CH3OH synthesis in comparison with the dimer and linear ensemble cases. As discussed in above sections, the (1-H) CO2 * + H* → HCOO* reaction is considered to be the essential step to understand the catalysis of CH3OH synthesis. Thus, we concentrated on CO2 * + H* → HCOO* step in order to uncover the difference in the CH3OH synthesis activity for the different Zn ensembles. We find that the presence of a single Zn atom in the stepped Cu(2 1 1)step site significantly lowers the activation energy barrier for the CO2 * + H* → HCOO* (Ga = 1.07 eV) compared to the dimer (Ga = 1.67 eV) and linear ensemble (Ga = 1.38 eV) cases. This indicates the higher catalytic activity of the single Zn atom toward the first CO2 hydrogenation than the dimer and linear ensemble cases. In order to better understand the enhanced catalysis of a single Zn atom in CH3OH synthesis, we examined the structures of transition states (indicated by [H---COO]#) for the CO2 * + H* → HCOO* reaction for the single Zn atom, dimer and linear ensemble. As displayed in Fig. 11 , we identify the different molecular structure of [H---COO]# between a single Zn atom and clustered ensembles. That is, the C—H bond is formed by the interaction between the adsorbed H and the C in CO2 for the single Zn atom case, while for the dimer/linear cases the O—H bond is formed via the H attack on the O of CO2. As a result, the energy of transition state (in turn, reaction barrier) for a single Zn atom is considerably stabilized compared to the dimer/linear cases. This is also consistent with the trend of calculated rate constants of CO2 * + H* → HCOO* reaction (see Fig. S10). That is, Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step (k = 2.2 × 10 s−1) > Cu(2 1 1)linear-Zn-step(3.5 s−1) > Cu(2 1 1)dimer-Zn-step (1.4 × 10−5s−1). Tables 6 and S11 shows the turnover frequencies (TOF) of CH3OH production and surface coverages of reaction intermediates (θ) obtained by a microkinetic modeling for the single Zn atom, dimer and linear ensemble cases at a typical experimental condition of P = 75 bar (90% H2, 10% CO2) and T = 523 K. We find that the order of the turnover frequencies of CH3OH production is Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step (TOFCH3OH = 3.07 × 10−5) > Cu(2 1 1)linear-Zn-step(5.53 × 10−7) > Cu(2 1 1)dimer-Zn-step (1.62 × 10−7), indicating the higher ability of a single Zn atom to enhance the catalysis of CH3OH synthesis compared to the dimer/liner ensemble cases. As discussed in above sections, the TOF of CH3OH production is calculated by the multiplication of the rate constant of CH3O* + H* → CH3OH* step and surface coverages of CH3O* and H*. Our DFT calculation shows the slight variation of rate constants for the CH3O* + H* → CH3OH* reaction for the different Zn ensembles with the order of Cu(2 1 1)linear-Zn-step(k = 9.5 × 10−2) Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step (7.4 × 10−4) > Cu(2 1 1)dimer-Zn-step (4.9 × 10−5). On the other hand, in case of θCH3O, there are no noticeable differences between the different Zn ensembles, while θH shows the decrease of several orders of magnitude by the increase of Zn ensemble size [note Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step (θH = 4.48 × 10−2) > Cu(2 1 1)dimer-Zn-step (8.49 × 10−3) > Cu(2 1 1)linear-Zn-step(6.11 × 10−6) ]. Those differences in θH have a significant effect on the CH3OH formation compared to the differences in k for the CH3O* + H* → CH3OH* reaction, which results in the highest TOFCH3OH of a single Zn atom. In Fig. S7, we depict the variation of TOFCH3OH as a function of the partial pressure of H2 gas. We also observe the highest catalytic activity of the single Zn atom toward the CH3OH production regardless of the H2 concentration in feed stream compared to the dimer/linear ensembles. The higher coverage of θH for the single Zn atom than the dimer/linear ensembles is related to the different affinity between H—Cu bond and H—Zn bond. As depicted by the H adsorption energy of Table S8, our DFT calculation exhibits the stronger bonding strength between H and a single Zn atom ensemble (Eads = −2.63 eV) than the dimer (Eads = −2.15 eV) and linear ensemble (Eads = −2.02 eV) cases. This implies the strikingly reduced H affinity at Zn atom compared to the Cu atom, leading to the low availability of H for the CH3O hydrogenation and in turn the poor activity of the dimer/linear ensembles toward CH3OH production. To better understand the reduced H affinity at the Zn atom at the clustered Zn ensembles, we present the projected d-states of the bare surface atoms for the single, dimer and linear ensembles in Fig. 14. Here, we averaged the d-states of three surface atoms which are associated with the adsorbed H atom. For example, the H atom of a single Zn atom, dimer, and linear ensembles have the bond with three Cu, two Cu/one Zn, one Cu/two Zn atoms, respectively. First, we find that the d-band of Zn is located in the lower energy region (−8.00 eV < E − Ef < −6.50 eV) than the Cu atom case (−4.50 eV < E − Ef < −1.50 eV), suggesting the lower activity of Zn toward the H adsorption than the Cu case. Second, our DFT calculation shows the significant upshift of the average d-band center ( ε ¯ d = −2.15 eV) for the single Zn atom case compared to the dimer (−3.75 eV) and linear ensembles (−5.29 eV), resulting in the decreased H affinity at the clustered Zn ensembles. Note that according to the d-band center theory, the local activity of surface atoms tends to enhance by the upshift of d-band center and vice versa [49]."
8,On the role of a single Zn atom in Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step for boosting the CH3OH production,"3.6 On the role of a single Zn atom in Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step for boosting the CH3OH production In previous sections, we have shown that the Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surface plays an important role in significantly reducing the kinetics of the rate-controlling step (the first CO2 hydrogenation [CO2 + H → HCOO]) in CH3OH synthesis, leading to the enhanced catalytic reactivity toward the CH3OH formation compared to the Cu(2 1 1)step and Cu(2 1 1)kink surfaces. The energetic explanation for such improvement in the Cu(2 1 1)Zn-step surface is the increase of the binding strength of HCOO on the surface site. Note the lowest adsorption energy (the strongest binding strength) in the Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surface (Eads = −3.72 eV) among the other surfaces (Eads = −2.71 eV [Cu(1 1 1)terrace], Eads = −3.56 eV [Cu(2 1 1)step], and Eads = −3.58 eV [Cu(2 1 1)kink]) (see Table 2). To better understand the fundamental reason of the increased bonding strength between the HCOO and the surface atoms of Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step, we calculate the projected local density of state (LDOS) for the d-band of the Cu and Zn atoms of the clean Cu(1 1 1)terrace, Cu(2 1 1)step, Cu(2 1 1)kink, and Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surfaces. The d-band centers are also shown in the inset of the Fig. 12 (b). First, for the Cu d-band of the Cu(2 1 1)step and Cu(2 1 1)kink surfaces, we see the disappearance of the sharp peaks (at about −3.5 eV and −2.7 eV) located in the low energy region of LDOS compared to the Cu(1 1 1)terrace surface, leading to the up-shift of d-band centers (indicated by εd) toward the Fermi level in the defective Cu(2 1 1)step, and Cu(2 1 1)kink surfaces. Note the εd = −2.31 eV [Cu(1 1 1)terrace], εd = −2.23 eV [Cu(2 1 1)step], and εd = −2.12 eV [Cu(2 1 1)kink]. Considering the prior studies on the relationship between the d-band center and the local surface reactivity (i.e. an upshift of εd toward the Fermi level suggests the activity of surface atoms toward adsorbate and vice versa), this result indicates the increase of the HCOO binding strength at the surfaces of Cu(2 1 1)step, and Cu(2 1 1)kink compared to the Cu(1 1 1)terrace [39,49,50]. Next, looking at the d-band of surface Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step atoms (see Fig. S6), we see the complete separation of the energy levels of LDOS between the Cu and Zn atoms. Note that the peaks of LDOS in the Zn d-band lie in the lower energy region (−7.20 eV < E − Ef < −6.29 eV) than Cu d-band (−3.68 eV < E − Ef < −1.31 eV). For the Cu d-band case, the εd is predicted to move away from the Fermi level by 0.05 eV in comparison with the εd of the surface Cu atom in Cu(2 1 1)step (see Fig. 12(a)). The primary reason for this down-shift is the perturbation of Cu d-band caused by the electronic charge transferred from a neighboring Zn atom. Note the charge gain of Cu atom (Δσ = +0.062e) and loss of Zn atom (Δσ = −0.189e) in Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surface, which is obtained from Bader charge analysis (see Table 5 ). As a result of this downshift, the activity of surface activity toward HCOO is expected to be reduced. However, our DFT calculation on the Eads of HCOO for the Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surface shows the opposite result; that is, the lowered Eads (increased binding strength). This suggests that the surface Zn d-band may play more critical role in increasing the binding strength of bidentate HCOO adsorbate with the Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surface than the Cu d-band case. To support this, we calculate the LDOS projected onto the Zn 3d-band, Cu 3d-band, and O 2p-band for the HCOO-adsorbed Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surface. As shown in Fig. 12(b), the overlap of O 2p—Zn 3d electrons is located in the lower energy region (−7.20 eV < E − Ef < −6.29 eV) than the O 2p-Cu 3d case (−3.68 eV < E − Ef < −2.66 eV). The result implies the stronger strength of O—Zn bond than the O—Cu bond. To further understand the bonding nature between HCOO and Zn-modified Cu(2 1 1) step site, we calculate the total charge density difference (referred to ΔCdiff) for the HCOO adsorption at Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step and Cu(2 1 1)step surfaces (see Fig. 13 ). Here, the ΔCdiff is computed by subtracting the respective charge density of the HCOO and bare slab systems from the total charge density of the HCOO-adsorbed slab system and indicates the redistribution of electrons after the HCOO adsorption process occurs. For the HCOO-adsorbed Cu(2 1 1)step surface, we find the charge accumulation in the center region of two O—Cu bonds, suggesting the formation of covalent-like bond between O 2p—Cu 3d electrons. On the other hand, for the HCOO-adsorbed Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surface, we identify the similar covalent-like bonding nature to the Cu(2 1 1)step surface but the higher charge accumulation in the O—Zn bond than the O—Cu bond case. This suggests that the adsorption energy may be mainly determined by the O 2p—Zn 3d electrons rather than the O 2p—Cu 3d electrons in the Zn-modified Cu(2 1 1) surface. This is also in line with above LDOS analysis; the overlap between O 2p—Zn 3d electrons occurs in lower energy region than the O 2p—Cu 3d electrons."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, using the spin-polarized DFT and microkinetic modeling, we found that the nature of defects at the Cu-based catalysts greatly affects the kinetics of the CH3OH synthesis from CO2 and H2. In particular, the single Zn-substituted stepped site [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step] significantly boosts the catalytic activity toward the CH3OH synthesis compared to the traditionally-known active Cu(2 1 1) step site, while for the single Cu-vacant sixfold-coordinated stepped (kinked) site [Cu(2 1 1)kink] and the opposite is true. Note the order of calculated TOF for the CH3OH production [Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step (3.07 × 10−5 s−1) > Cu(2 1 1)step (2.73 × 10−7 s−1) > Cu(1 1 1)terrace (1.56 × 10−9 s−1) > Cu(2 1 1)kink (3.34 × 10−15 s−1)]. The reduced catalysis in the kink site is related to the high endothermic proximity energy (repulsive interaction) of the coadsorbed state (caused by the insufficient surface sites for the stable coadsorption) for the rate-determining OH + H → H2O reaction, leading to the increase of activation energy barriers. On the other hand, the Zn-enhanced catalysis of CH3OH production at the Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step site compared to other defective Cu(2 1 1)step, and Cu(2 1 1)kink sites is associated with the substantial increase of the binding strength of the key reaction intermediate having oxygen group (i.e. HCOO) at Zn-modified surface, leading to the significant enhancement of the kinetics in the initial rate-demanding CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Our DFT calculation on electronic structures (LDOS and charge density difference plot) revealed that the stronger covalent-like overlap between O 2p—Zn 3d electrons than the O 2p—Cu 3d case in the HCOO-adsorbed Cu(2 1 1) single-Zn-step site is key to the increase of HCOO binding strength at the single Zn-substituted stepped site. We also confirmed the energetically favorable existence of a single Zn atom in the Cu(2 1 1)step site over Zn dimer and Zn linear trimer and enhanced stability of a single Zn atom in the Cu(2 1 1)single-Zn-step surface over a single Cu atom in Cu(2 1 1)step. In addition, our DFT calculation predicted that the activities for CH3OH production are considerably affected by the type of surface Zn ensembles. In particular, based on the TOF of CH3OH production, the single Zn atom was found to exhibit the highest activity of CH3OH production (TOFCH3OH = 3.07 × 10−5 s−1) over the dimer (1.62 × 10−7 s−11) and linear ensemble (5.53 × 10−7 s−1). The reduced activity for the Zn dimer/linear ensemble is related to the weaker affinity of Zn with H than the Cu-H case, which leads to the low coverage of surface H atom and in turn retard the CH3OH production via CH3O hydrogenation. Our study hints at the importance of properly engineering the nature of defects at the Cu-based catalysts for boosting the CH3OH production from CO2 and H2 by tuning the arrangement of surface Zn atoms on the stepped Cu(2 1 1) site."
