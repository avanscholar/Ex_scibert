0,Introduction,"Fuel cell, emitting the minimum amount of greenhouse gases and almost no harmful by-products, is regarded as an alternative resource of energy to resolve the issue resulted from the sharply increased demand of energy and the more acute problems related to environmental pollution in last decades [1]. Fuel cells are fed with molecular hydrogen and generate electrical power by electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen. The H2 steam must meet several specifications to ensure regular operation of fuel cells, e.g., a low concentration level of CO (less than 20ppm) and a stable H2 production. Considering the safety and storage of hydrogen, the on-board hydrogen production from liquid hydrocarbons is practical. Hence, methanol was envisaged as a promising H2-carrier to feed fuel cells systems [2–5]. As the simplest compounds in alcohols, it has only one carbon atom, reducing the number of reaction by-products notably. Methanol also profits from the absence of the CC bonds in molecule. The reforming can conduct at relatively low temperature (200–350°C), while the temperature for the reforming of ethanol is usually in the range of 400–500°C and that for glycerol is above 500°C [6–8]. In comparison with fuels like gasoline, diesel, methane and ethanol, methanol is prior for its high hydrogen to carbon ratio and the rich source either from fossil resources or from biomass. Besides, its sulphur content (<5ppm) is even lower than other hydrocarbons [2]. Furthermore, the direct use of methanol, which is a key platform chemical for existing fuel and chemical infrastructures and which has a high energy content of 5420kcalkg−1, is economically more attractive [9]. The steam reforming of methanol provides hydrogen via Eq. (1) [10]. (1) CH3OH+H2O↔CO2 +3H2, ΔH 0 =+49.7kJmol−1 And the CO gas is formed in the methanol decomposition (Eq. (2)) or reversed water gas shift reaction (Eq. (3)). In the steam reforming process, the amount of CO can be decreased as much as possible at the exit [3]. (2) CH3OH↔CO+2H2, ΔH 0 =+90.2kJmol−1 (3) CO2 +H2 ↔CO+H2O, ΔH 0 =+41.2kJmol−1 Catalysts play critical role in the hydrogen yield and purity in hydrogen production process. Copper-containing catalysts have widely been used in steam reforming of methanol for the high catalytic activity and low cost compared with precious metals. The catalytic properties of copper-based catalysts for the reforming of methanol are strongly depended on the morphological and chemical properties of copper which are affected by interaction with the support employed [11]. The copper catalysts loaded on different supports have been studied, e.g., SiO2 [5], MgO [12], ZrO2 [13–15], ZnO [16–18] and Al2O3 [19–22]. Among them, Al2O3 is widely used as support for Cu-based catalyst because of its high thermal stability, low cost, and high surface area for active metal loading. Furthermore, the addition of some rare earth oxides, in particular samarium oxide (Sm2O3), to catalysts has been found to illustrate good performance in several catalytic reactions, which was ascribed to the excellent thermal stability and good release/storage oxygen capacity of Sm2O3 [23,24]. For example, the samarium was also used to modify the CeO2-based catalysts in hydrogen production by methanol steam reforming. The triple-charged ions in the lattice of CeO2 can decrease the temperature at which redox process occur and form the vacancies in the anion sublattice which better diffuses the lattice oxygen [25]. However, the knowledge on the use of Sm2O3 as addition for copper oxide based catalysts was still quite limited, and to the best of our knowledge, the samarium oxide as the modification of copper oxide methanol steam reforming has not been reported so far. Based on the above considerations, a series of Cu/Al2O3 catalysts with different contents of samarium were prepared and used for steam reforming of methanol to produce hydrogen. The role of samarium addition and the effects of the samarium loading on the surface structure and catalytic properties were investigated. Several characterization studies, including H2-TPR, XRD, XPS and HAADF/STEM were carried out to investigate the effects of modification of Sm on the physicochemical properties of the Cu/Al2O3 catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation CuSm/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness method. The content of Cu in catalysts was fixed to 7.5wt.%. Samarium contents in the catalysts are 0, 5, 7.5, 10 and 12.5wt.%, respectively. Initially, the desired amount of copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) and samarium nitrate hexahydrate (Sm (NO3)3·6H2O) were dissolved in distilled water, and then the aqueous solution was impregnated onto commercial γ-Al2O3. The resulting samples were dried at 120°C for 4h in air flow, and finally calcined at 400°C for 4h in a mullfe. The catalysts will be named as 0SmCu, 5SmCu, 7.5SmCu, 10SmCu and 12.5SmCu according to samarium content."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm was recorded by NOVA 4200e surface area & pore size analyzer of Quantachrome Instrument. N2 adsorption-desorption took 50mg (powder) for each sample and all the samples were degassed under vacuum at 300°C for 3h before the measurement. Specific surface areas of the catalysts were calculated by the BET method. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles were obtained on an apparatus equipped with a TCD detector. 50g (100–120mesh) of sample was put into a quartz tube with 8mm inner diameter and was pretreated at 100°C for 1h in the argon flow. Then, 10vol.% H2/Ar flow at the rate of 30mlmin−1 was introduced in and temperature increased from 100°C to 500°C, with a ramp rate of 10°C/min. The data of XRD, XPS and HAADF/STEM come from the samples before and/or after reduction. The reduction of sample (40–60mesh) was carried out in 50% H2-N2 flow at 450°C for 1h. All the samples were grinded in an agate mortar until there was no sense of particles. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) of catalysts were carried out on a Rigaku D/Max-1200 diffractometer. The CuKα radiation (λ=0.154056nm) was operated at 40kV and 30mA, with a scanning angle (2θ) of 20°–80° and a scanning speed of 2°min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded with Thermo ESCALAB 250xi. The spectrometer was operated at 150W, and aluminum anode (Al Kα, hν =1486.6eV) was used. The C 1s line (284.8eV) was used as the reference to calculate the binding energies (BE). High-angle annular dark field imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF/STEM) analysis used an Tecnai G2 TF30 S-Twin, at the acceleration voltage of 120kV."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The methanol steam reforming was performed in a fixed-bed quartz reactor from 200 to 300°C under atmospheric pressure. 200mg of powdered catalyst (40–60mesh) was packed into the quartz tube with an inner diameter of 10mm in the reactor, and then pre-reduced in a steam of 50-vol.% hydrogen diluted with N2 at 450°C for 1h. After that, hydrogen was suspended, and the pure N2 was admitted till hydrogen was totally eliminated and the temperature decreased to 200°C. Then the reaction feedstock (water to methanol molar ratio=3:1) and N2 were admitted. The feedstock was fed into the reaction system at 0.02ml/min and will be gasified at 170°C before entering the reactor. The products were analyzed online by gas chromatograph. Methanol conversion (XMeOH), hydrogen yield (YH2), CO selectivity (SCO) and CO2 selectivity (SCO2) over catalysts after the reaction were calculated according to the equations (refer Eq. (4) in Ref. [10]; refer Eq. (5) in Ref. [20,26,27]; refer Eq. (6) in Ref. [28]): (4) X M e O H = F M e O H , i n − F M e O H , o u t F M e O H , i n × 100 % (5) Y H 2 = F H 2 ( F M e O H , i n − F M e O H , o u t ) × 3 × 100 % (6) S C O = y C O y C O + y C O 2 × 100 % (7) S C O 2 = y C O 2 y C O + y C O 2 × 100 % Where F is flow rate of compound in the gaseous effluent, and y is the molar fractions at the reactor exit."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic performance,"3.1 Catalytic performance Contents of samarium in the catalysts may govern the extent of reaction. The hydrogen yield corresponding to the reaction temperature in the range 200–300°C is shown in Fig. 1 . High temperature is favorable for the hydrogen production and the results are consistent with this expect. The hydrogen yield of 0SmCu increased greatly from 38.98% at 200°C to 99.88% at 280°C, and 100% hydrogen yield was obtained at 300°C. The other four catalysts had the similar increase trend, but the value of hydrogen yield of these catalysts were significantly lower than that of 0SmCu. There was no other catalyst obtained 100% hydrogen yield as 0SmCu and the maximum hydrogen yield of Sm-containing catalysts was 99.98% at 300°C over 5SmCu. At the same temperature, hydrogen yield decreases in the order of 0SmCu>5SmCu>7.5SmCu>10SmCu>12.5SmCu. The higher content of samarium, the lower yield of hydrogen. This result reveals that the hydrogen yield significantly decreased due to the presence of samarium in catalysts. Fig. 2 compares the conversion of methanol in the reforming process. As expected, the conversion increased with temperature. Although all catalysts achieved complete conversion at 300°C, the 0SmCu catalyst showed a distinct advantage compared with other four catalysts. Methanol conversion of 0SmCu surged to 100% at 280°C, while 5SmCu and 7.5SmCu also achieved complete conversion at 280°C. Nevertheless, methanol conversion of them in the range of 200–260°C were obvious lower than that of 0SmCu. This advantage is more visible over 10SmCu and 12.5SmCu. The conversion of 10SmCu at 280°C hovered near 90% and that of 12.5SmCu was only around 70%. The decrease order of methanol conversion is coincident with that of hydrogen yield. The evident decline of methanol conversion over Sm-containing catalysts indicates the presence of samarium is unfavorable for methanol conversion. We also analyzed the content of CO2 and CO in products. Note, that CO2 selectivity over the five catalysts were all 100% in the range of 200–300°C (calculated according to Eq. (7), but not presented). This result indicates that the reaction sequence is that CO2 and H2 are the primary products in our experimental condition. CO might form at higher temperatures by the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS) according the literature [25]."
7,N2 adsorption-desorption,"3.2 N2 adsorption-desorption Textural and structural properties can be changed due to the presence of samarium. More homogeneous particle size distribution, more uniform distribution of particles, smaller particles size, more narrow size distribution of particles, absence of agglomeration of particles and finally better surficial morphology lead to higher specific surface areas [29]. The surface areas of 5SmCu, 7.5SmCu, 10SmCu and 12.5SmCu catalysts underwent the reduction decreased about a half compared with 0SmCu, as listed in Table 1 . Catalysts with higher surface area could provide more active sites for adsorption of reactants. 0SmCu with the highest surface area may have smaller particle size or more uniform distribution of particles, on the contrary, catalysts containing samarium might form unfavorable surficial morphology or particle agglomeration. Hence, the surface area decrease may relate to decline of hydrogen yield and methanol conversion over Sm-containing catalysts. The pore diameter distributions of all the samples determined by BJH method are given in Fig. 3 . It profiles clearly that all the samples distributed in the range 3–10nm. For the Sm-containing catalysts, profiles of them presented a sharp peak around 3.8nm, while 0SmCu centered around 3.4nm. The pore volume of 0SmCu is 0.403cc/g and that of the other four Sm-containing catalysts dropped below 0.200cc/g. These results reflect that the surface area deceased by samarium addition, while the pore size distribution almost unchanged. This phenomenon is attributed to Sm oxides dispersed on the external surface of γ-Al2O3 and partial Sm oxides blocked the pore structure of γ-Al2O3 [30]."
8,H2-TPR measurements,"3.3 H2-TPR measurements H2-Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles are presented in Fig. 4 . The peaks around 200°C and 250°C were reported as the typical peaks of Cu/Al2O3 system. The peak around 200°C is attribute to the reduction of isolated Cu2+ ions or small two- and three-dimensional clusters, and the 250°C peak is attribute to the reduction of large three-dimensional clusters and bulk phase [31]. Reduction peaks in the range of temperature 200–350°C are observed in all samples and presumed to be the reduction of CuO in our experiment condition[5]. The effect of Sm on the profiles can be discerned. 0SmCu catalyst showed the reduction peak at the lowest temperature (234°C), and there was a shoulder at 263°C. For 5SmCu catalyst, the reduction peak appeared at 260°C, also, with a shoulder at 280°C. The two peaks belong to 0SmCu and 5SmCu are assigned to the reduction of dispersed CuO and crystalline CuO respectively. It is visible that the reduction temperature shifted from 234°C to 299°C with the content of samarium. These results demonstrate that the presence of samarium in the catalysts inhibited the reduction of CuO species upon the surface of γ-Al2O3, indicating the existence of the interaction between the reducible CuO and Sm2O3 [32]. Kush Rana et al. reported that the increase in samarium concentration in Sm-type Ba-Co hexaferrite leads to a strong MeO bond formation. The shift of reduction temperature after Sm addition in our results probably relate to the strong MeO bond [33]."
9,XRD measurements,"3.4 XRD measurements The catalysts were characterized by XRD to determine the modification provoked by Sm. To determine the properties of the final solid using in the reforming reaction, both the catalysts before and after the reduction were analyzed. In Fig. 5 , the XRD patterns of all the five catalysts show strong peaks at 2θ values of 35.58°, 38.48° and 49.09° represent three different planes of CuO: CuO (−111), CuO (111) and CuO (020) [9,13,34]. At high temperature, the oxidation possibility of copper species which have strong interaction with matrix increases and crystallization of CuO particles took place, so the corresponding peaks of the formed phases appear in the XRD patterns [5]. A great number of copper-based catalysts were investigated and it is believed that metallic Cu species are the active sites in Cu-containing catalysts and the available Cu surface area is link to the activity [35,36]. The patterns of the catalysts after the reduction are shown in Fig. 6 . In Fig. 6A, only the diffraction peaks of Cu0 are revealed at 43.34° and 50.49° corresponding to Cu0 (111) and Cu0 (200), confirms Cu0 is the active phase in the CuSm/Al2O3 catalysts for steam reforming of methanol [37,38]. In general, the high activity of copper-containing catalysts is due to the highly disperse Cu metal particles, which has high accessibility to methanol and steam [35]. The low intensity of peaks results from particles with uniform distribution and the sharp peaks are due to high composition. The intensity of Cu0 (111) and Cu0 (200) characteristic peaks increase with the augmentation of samarium content in the samples. The Cu metal particles on 0SmCu catalyst with the weakest intensity implies the smaller Cu size. The copper crystallite sizes cultivated by Scherrer equation are presented in Table 2 . Comparing with 0SmCu, the size of Sm-containing catalysts are all increased. Moreover, the larger size could also suppress the reduction of Cu species [39]. According to the catalytic activity and characteristic results above, there is a hypothesis that the presence of Sm in the Cu/Al2O3 system favors the clustering of Cu particles, leading to the increase of Cu size. The diffraction patterns of Al2O3 were detected in all samples, but detectable Sm2O3 did not present in any samples, indicating the Sm particles are highly dispersed on the support or fine crystals incorporated in matrix that could not be detected. The slight shift of characteristic peaks corresponding to Cu0 from the original diffraction peak over the 0SmCu to lower 2θ values noted in the samarium-containing samples is illustrated in Fig. 6B. Sm3+ ions can occupy the octahedral site of Fe3+ site resulting the internal stresses to make the lattice distorted and results in an expansion of ferrite lattice [32]. The report of CeO2 put forward that the inserting of larger sized dopants into CeO2 lattice can enlarge the unit cell of octahedral site in fluorite structure oxide, leading the diffraction peak shift to lower 2θ position [40]. Younes Hanifehpour et al. observed the shift to the lower diffraction angles over the samarium-doped ZnS nanoparticles, it was ascribed related to the expansion of ZnS lattice due to larger Sm3+ ions compared with Zn2+ ions (0.74Å) [41]. The shift of Cu0 peaks may be resulted by the expansion of Cu particles due to larger ions Sm3+ (1.08Å) [40] than copper cation (Cu2+ =0.65Å) [25]. The lattice constants in Table 2 increase, confirms this speculation."
10,XPS measurements,"3.5 XPS measurements To point put the chemical composition over the catalysts surface the XPS was carried out. Fig. 7 shows the spectra of from quantitative XPS analysis of the five catalyst. Fig. 7A and B are the survey spectra of Cu2p peaks before and after the reduction, and Fig. 7C and D are that of Sm3d peaks. The details of XPS parameters of all the samples are reported in Tables 2 and 3 . Cupric compounds have intense satellites on the higher binding energy sides of 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 when cuprous compounds have no satellites associated with any of these bands [42]. In Fig. 7A, the spectra of Cu 2p present two peaks in binding energies range 933–934eV and 953–954eV, assigned to the oxide components of Cu, accompanied by intense satellite features at 943 and 963eV, respectively [43]. The binding energy of the samples shift to lower binding energy, confirming the formation of Cu0 [44]. It is consistent with the results of XRD. The spectra of Sm3d have scarcely any change after the reduction (in Table 3). As shown in Fig. 7A, the Cu 2p3/2 spectra present in all the five samples, while the intensity of photoelectron peaks for 5SmCu, 7.5SmCu, 10SmCu and 12.5SmCu decrease. The intensity ratios were calculated from XPS data and listed in Table 2. The Cu/Al ratio decreased with the increase of samarium content, which is not coincident with the theoretical values in our work. This difference indicated a multilayer deposition, implying clustering of the impregnated Cu species at the surface of the support [45]. This result confirms the hypothesis that the presence of samarium in the catalysts leads to the clustering of Cu particles. The decline of hydrogen yield and methanol conversion presented in the catalytic tests is attributed to the clustering, on account of clustering of particles mainly caused the decrease in the Cu surface amount [14]."
11,HAADF/STEM analysis,"3.6 HAADF/STEM analysis HAADF/STEM was carried out to clarify the detailed structures of the catalysts with and without samarium. Particles were seen in the HAADF/STEM micrographs of 0SmCu and 12.5SmCu samples reduced at 450°C in 50% H2-N2 flow for 1h. The bright dots are assigned to Cu. Fine Cu particles on 0SmCu catalyst are presented in Fig. 8 (A), while it is rather difficult to distinguish the isolate Cu particles on 12.5SmCu catalyst from Fig. 8(B). The unbroken dots in Fig. 8(B) reflect the obvious clustering of Cu particles in the observable thin areas of samples, which is great consistent with tests and analysis results above."
12,Conclusion,"A series of Cu/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared with incipient wetness method, and these catalysts were tested in methanol steam reforming for hydrogen production. 0SmCu catalyst exhibited the highest hydrogen yield and methanol conversion in the catalytic tests, while both hydrogen yield and methanol conversion of Sm-containing catalysts decreased significantly with the increase of samarium content. From the result of H2-TPR, the presence of samarium caused active Cu particles more difficult to be reduced. XRD and XPS results verified the clustering of Cu particles over the Sm-containing catalysts which led to the increase of Cu size. In addition, HAADF/STEM images reconfirmed the clustering of Cu particles. Therefore, the addition of samarium onto Cu/Al2O3 catalysts inhibited the reducibility of Cu species and also led to the clustering of Cu particles. The clustering of Cu particles can decrease the surface Cu amount, thus, catalytic activity of Sm-containing catalysts significantly declined."
