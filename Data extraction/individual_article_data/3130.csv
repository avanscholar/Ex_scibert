0,Introduction,"Biological hydrogen production is potentially regarded as one of the most promising alternatives for sustainable green energy production [1,2]. Among various biological hydrogen production processes, dark fermentation is of significant importance, due to its higher rate of hydrogen evolution in the absence of any light source and its applicability to different types of organic wastes and wastewaters [3]. In spite of the intensive research on the dark fermentative hydrogen production, no commercial systems are yet available. One of the challenges for large scale biological hydrogen production is the preparation of large amounts of active and stable inocula from natural sources. To improve hydrogen production, the inocula must be enriched by the elimination of methanogens, homoacetogens, and sulfate reducing bacteria. The method by which the seed is enriched is considerably important as it may affect the start-up, overall efficiency and the stability of a continuous hydrogen production system [4]. Enrichment by heat treatment is the most common technique for screening of hydrogen-producing bacteria. Heat treatment of inocula eliminates non-spore forming hydrogen consuming microorganisms such as methanogens and initiates spore germination in Clostridia by altering their germination receptors [5,6]. Furthermore, since the germination of spores occurs in a batch mode prior to the continuous operation, the risk of the inocula wash-out is minimized [5]. A wide range of heat pretreated natural sources including anaerobically digested sludge [7], activated sludge [8], soil [9], cow dung [10], compost [11] and river sediments [12] have been used for continuous hydrogen production. Taking advantage of the heat treatment, Chang and Lin [13] has reported 8 months of constant hydrogen production and substrate degradation using municipal sewage sludge in an UASB operating at the HRT of 8–20h. Han et al. [14] used the heat treated sludge to inoculate four 50L fixed-bed reactors in the acidogenic stage of a pilot-scale two-stage hydrogen and methane producing system. The volatile solids removal efficiency and hydrogen production rate were 70.9% and 3.55m3/m3/d, respectively. Repeated heat treatment of a fraction of return sludge in a continuous hydrogen-producing system was reported to increase the yield of hydrogen production, but did not significantly affect the volumetric hydrogen production rate [6]. The cost-effectiveness of the heat treatment and the predominance of the sensitive Clostridial species in heat treated inocula make this approach controversial and necessitate further research. Enrichment of inocula by heat pretreatment consumes thermal energy. The energy required for the heat treatment might be economized using the excess heat in the process. Furthermore, the treatment can be less energy intensive if it is conducted at lower temperatures. Various treatment temperatures have been used in the literature for the enrichment of the hydrogen-producing inocula. Pretreatment at the boiling temperature is the most frequent reported enrichment method [15]. However, pretreatment at low temperatures of 75 and 85°C [16,17] as well as high temperature of 104°C [18] have been used for hydrogen production from mixed cultures. In all of these studies a variety of natural and synthetic feedstock, various inocula and different operation conditions have been used. Natural variability of bacterial cultures coupled with the complex biological hydrogen production mechanisms does not facilitate comparison between different studies. To the best of our knowledge and based on what is stated in the literature [15], no comparative study has been conducted to evaluate the effect of heat treatment at different temperatures on hydrogen production at the same experimental conditions. Temperatures of the heat pretreatment may significantly affect the microbial community and energy required for the process. The purpose of this research is to comprehensively compare the effect of heat pretreatment temperatures on the enrichment of two types of natural inocula, activated sludge and anaerobically digested sludge, for hydrogen production as well as to investigate the relationship between the metabolites, microbial community and hydrogen production at each pretreatment temperature."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inocula and treatment conditions,"2.1 Inocula and treatment conditions Two inoculum sources were investigated for hydrogen production: anaerobically digested sludge from St. Marys, Ontario, municipal wastewater treatment plant; and activated sludge from the Adelaide Pollution Control Plant in London, Ontario. Prior to their use, the sludge inocula were dewatered and then sieved through 2mm screen. In order to enrich hydrogen-producing bacteria, the inocula were heat treated at 65, 80 and 95°C for 30min. Untreated inocula were also used as control."
3,Batch experiments,"2.2 Batch experiments Hydrogen production experiments were conducted in duplicates in 320mL-vials containing 120mL of media. The concentration of volatile suspended solids (VSS) in each vial was 2g/L. In all samples, the medium contained 10g/L glucose as the carbon source and the following inorganic salts (mg/L): NH4Cl, 2600; K2HPO4, 250; MgCl2·6H2O, 125; FeSO4·7H2O, 5.0; CoCl2·6H2O, 2.5; MnCl2·4H2O, 2.5; KI, 2.5; Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.5; H3BO4, 0.5; NiCl2·6H2O, 0.5;ZnCl2, 0.5. The solution was buffered with 0.07M phosphate and the initial pH was adjusted to 6.7 using 2M NaOH and 2M HCl. Each vial was purged with nitrogen for 1min. The cultures were placed in a shaker–incubator at 37°C and 190rpm. The volume and the composition of the produced gas and also the concentration of the soluble metabolites were measured up to several hours after hydrogen production stopped."
4,Repeated batch experiments,"2.3 Repeated batch experiments After the completion of a batch operation (see previous section for the procedures), 60mL of the culture was collected and added to 60mL of fresh medium (to make the total working volume of 120mL) and the pH was adjusted to 6.7 under anaerobic conditions. The same procedure was repeated four times for other consecutive batches. During each batch, the amount and composition of the produced gas were measured. Soluble metabolites were detected at the end of each batch."
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis The biogas composition including hydrogen, methane and nitrogen was determined by a gas chromatograph (Model 310, SRI Instruments, Torrance, CA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a molecular sieve column (Molesieve 5A, mesh 80/100, 6ft×1/8in). The presence of hydrogen sulfide in the biogas was checked using another gas chromatograph (6890 series, Agilent) equipped with a flame photometric detector (FPD) and a capillary column (HP-5, 10m×0.32mm×0.25μm film thickness). The total gas volume was measured by releasing the gas pressure in the vials using a glass syringe (5–50mL) to equilibrate with the room pressure as recommended by Owen et al. [19]. Gas volumes were corrected to standard conditions (25°C and 1atm). The concentrations of organic acids including acetic acid, butyric acid, iso-butyric acid, lactic acid, valeric acid, iso-valeric acid and formic acid were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography system (1200 series, Agilent Technologies) equipped with Aminex HPX-87H ion exclusion column (300mm×7.8mm I.D.; BIO-RAD), and an UV-detector at 210nm. The column temperature was adjusted to 30°C. The same instrument with a refractive index detector (RID) was used to measure the concentrations of glucose and alcohols. The temperature of the RID detector was set to 35°C. The concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured according to standard methods [20]. The cumulative hydrogen production profiles were fitted with modified Gompertz Eq. (1) [21]: (1) H = P exp { − exp [ R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H is the cumulative hydrogen production (mL), P is the maximum hydrogen production (mL), R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h), λ is the lag phase time (h) and t is the incubation time (h). The cumulative hydrogen data were fitted with Gompertz equation using CurveExpert 1.3. Pearson correlation coefficients were determined using SPSS 10.0 (SPSS Inc., USA)."
6,Bacterial community analysis,"2.5 Bacterial community analysis The total genomic community DNA was extracted and purified using UltraClean Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The primer set of 349FGC (5′-CGCCCGCCGCGCGCGGCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGGCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and 518R (5′–ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′) at the annealing temperature of 53°C were used for the PCR amplification of the variable V3 region of 16S rDNA from the purified genomic DNA. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR products was performed with a DCode universal mutation system (Bio-Rad laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The PCR products were applied directly to 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel with 15–55% denaturant gradients. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 130V at 59°C for 4.5h. The DNA template of the bands of interest was re-amplified and the PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification Kit (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences of re-amplified DNA fragments were determined by dideoxy chain termination (Sequencing Facility, John P. Robarts Research Institute, London, Ontario) and compared with available sequences in GenBank database using the BLAST program [22]."
7,Results and discussions,
8,Effect of pretreatment temperature on fermentative hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of pretreatment temperature on fermentative hydrogen production Fig. 1 (a) and (b) shows the cumulative hydrogen production at different pretreatment temperatures for the activated and anaerobic sludges, respectively. The produced biogas in all of the samples only contained hydrogen and carbon dioxide. No methane and hydrogen sulfide were detected in any of the samples during the 165h of batch fermentation. When activated sludge was used as an inoculum in the batch tests, hydrogen production started after a short lag time of less than 7h (Fig. 1a). Untreated activated sludge produced only 82mL biogas which contained 39mL of hydrogen. A significant increase in hydrogen production was observed at pretreatment temperatures of 65 and 80°C. The maximum amounts of hydrogen produced with heat treatment at 65 and 80°C were 313 and 265mL, respectively. However, a 21.6 and 25.7% decrease in the hydrogen production was observed after 110 and 140h for 65 and 80°C heat pretreated activated sludge, respectively. The cumulative hydrogen production curves for anaerobic sludge are shown in Fig. 1b. The untreated anaerobic sludge yielded the least amount of both hydrogen (70mL) and total gas (131mL). Pretreated sludges at 65 and 80°C produced 342 and 317mL of hydrogen, respectively. The percentages of hydrogen in the evolved gas for the 65 and 80°C pretreated sludges were 56.2 and 54.1%, respectively. The amount of hydrogen production in the 95°C pretreated sludge was approximately 15% less than the amount produced by the 65°C pretreated inoculum. When anaerobic sludge was used as inoculum, at all pretreatment temperatures, no decrease in cumulative hydrogen was observed after hydrogen production stopped. Hydrogen yields (molhydrogen/molglucose), the specific hydrogen production (mmolhydrogen/gVSS) and growth yields (gVSS/gglucose) are illustrated in Table 1 . The highest yield (2.3molhydrogen/molglucose) and specific hydrogen production (63.3mmolhydrogen/gVSS) were achieved with the 65°C pretreated anaerobic sludge. The hydrogen yields and specific hydrogen production decreased with the increase of pretreatment temperatures in both types of inocula. Low hydrogen production was observed with both untreated activated sludge and untreated anaerobic sludge. Hydrogen production in the 95°C pretreated activated sludge was even less than the untreated inoculum, which reflects the suppressing effect of the heat pretreatment at high temperatures on this inoculum. However, the lower treatment temperatures of 65 and 80°C could enhance the hydrogen production about 7.3 and 6.7 times in comparison with untreated sample, respectively (these values were calculated based on 39mL of evolved hydrogen in the untreated activated sludge and maximum hydrogen production in 65 and 80°C pretreated activated sludge shown in Table 2 ). The microbial load in all the samples before the heat treatment was approximately 2gVSS/L. No significant difference was observed in the volatile suspended solids (VSS) before and after the heat pretreatment. However, different pretreatment temperatures resulted in different VSS concentrations at the end of the fermentation, with final VSS concentrations in the untreated activated sludge and the treated activated sludge at 65, 80 and 95°C of 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.9gVSS/L, respectively. The corresponding values for anaerobic sludge were 3.2, 3.1, 3.2 and 2.6gVSS/L. The related growth yields are depicted in Table 1. Growth yields in the anaerobic sludge were higher than the ones observed in the activated sludge, except for the vials which were heat treated at 95°C. Heat treatment at 95°C resulted in high growth yield of 0.16gVSS/g glucose in the activated sludge together with the production of lactic acid as the predominant metabolite (data will be presented later). The calculated yields in this study are within the range of 0.03–1.6gVSS/g glucose which are close to the yields of 0.04–0.15gVSS/g glucose reported by Cheong and Hansen [23]."
9,Kinetic analysis,3.2 Kinetic analysis The kinetic parameters estimated by modified Gompertz equation are presented in Table 2. The maximum hydrogen production rate (R m) decreased with increasing heat treatment temperature for both activated sludge and anaerobically digested sludge samples. The highest R m (26.3mL/h) and maximum specific hydrogen production rate (109.6mL/gVSSh) were observed for the anaerobic sludge pretreated at 65°C. The increase in the treatment temperature had a negative effect on the hydrogen production rate. The descending order of R m values in all inocula tested was as follows: 65°C heat treated anaerobic sludge >80°C treated anaerobic sludge >65°C treated activated sludge >80°C treated activated sludge >95°C treated anaerobic sludge.
10,Intermediate metabolites production,"3.3 Intermediate metabolites production The concentrations of soluble metabolites were measured at various time intervals during the course of hydrogen production. The formation of metabolites together with glucose consumption for the activated sludge and anaerobic sludge are illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively. The organic fatty acids detected during hydrogen production were acetate, butyrate, lactate, propionate, formate and iso-valerate, while ethanol was the sole alcohol detected in all cases. The intermediate metabolite formation showed different profiles depending on the pretreatment temperatures and the type of the inocula. Except for the 95°C pretreated anaerobic sludge which exhibited the largest lag time of 14.5h (Table 2) other inocula started acid formation and glucose utilization almost immediately. In all the inocula with high level of hydrogen production, including the activated sludge treated at 65 and 80°C; and the anaerobic sludge treated at 65, 80 and 95°C, hydrogen production was accompanied by the formation of high amounts of butyrate and acetate (Figs. 2 and 3). High levels of ethanol were observed only in the untreated inocula (Figs. 2a and 3a) with poor hydrogen production. Statistical analysis, based on Pearson correlation coefficients, showed that the cumulative hydrogen production was significantly correlated with acetate, butyrate and total VFA (Table 3 ). Pearson correlation coefficients between 0.85 and 1.0 were considered as good association. No significant correlation was observed between cumulative hydrogen production and ethanol. In the untreated activated sludge, the 95°C pretreated activated sludge and untreated anaerobic sludge, lactic acid was the predominant soluble metabolite (Figs. 2a,d and 3a). All of these batches produced very low amount of hydrogen gas (according to Fig. 1). These results correspond with some other studies [24,25] which show the inhibitory effect of lactic acid fermentation on hydrogen production. Noike et al. [24] demonstrated the inhibitory effect of two lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus paracasei and Enterococcus durans, on hydrogen production caused by the lethal effect of bacteriocins excreted from these bacteria on other bacteria including hydrogen producers. Heat treatment at 50°C for 30min was reported as an efficient method for the elimination of these inhibiting bacteria. Although, such bacteria could possibly be responsible for the inhibition of the hydrogen production in the untreated inocula, they could not cause inhibition to 95°C treated activated sludge because of their inability to form heat resistant spores. However, Clostridium butyricum and C. acetobutyricum which were identified in this study (will be presented in the following text) use branched metabolic pathways with the capability of lactate formation [26,27] and are likely to be the cause of lactate production. Although lactic acid was produced in some of the other inocula during the first 24h of fermentation, it was totally consumed later. Comparison of soluble metabolite production curves for activated sludge pretreated at 65 and 80°C (Fig. 2b,c) and the corresponding hydrogen production curves (Fig. 1a) illustrate that net decrease in hydrogen after 110h and 140h in the 65 and 80°C pretreated activated sludge was accompanied by an increase in the level of acetic acid. This could be because of hydrogen consumption by homoacetogens through the following reaction [28]: (2) 4H2 +2CO2 →CH3COO− +H+ +2H2O Eq. (2) indicates that 1mol of acetate can be produced by consumption of 4mol of hydrogen. In the activated sludge pretreated at 65°C, consumption of 67mL (2.99mmol) of hydrogen gas corresponded with 482mg/L (0.889mmol) acetate formation which is 119% of the theoretical acetate formation calculated from Eq. (2). Consumption of 68mL (3.04mmol) hydrogen in the 80°C pretreated activated sludge was accompanied by 460mg/L (0.804mmol) increase in acetate which is 106% of the theoretical values. The high yield values could be because of the acetate formation by other metabolic reactions. Although these results stoichiometrically substantiate the high probability of hydrogen loss through homoacetogenesis in the activated sludge pretreated at 65 and 80°C, it is also plausible that uptake hydrogenase activities of Clostridium species may have attributed to hydrogen consumption [29]. Table 4 summarizes the characteristics of soluble products after 116h of fermentation. Higher concentrations of acetate in the activated sludge samples (7.7–43.7%) versus those in anaerobic sludge (8.0–32.1%) could be attributed to the presence of more facultative anaerobes in the activated sludge, as the conversion of glucose to acetate is the favorable reaction of the facultative anaerobes, while the conversion to butyrate is the typical reaction observed in strict anaerobic bacteria [3]. In the vials with poor hydrogen production (untreated activated and anaerobic sludges and activated sludge pretreated at 95°C) lactic acid was the predominant metabolite with concentrations between 50.8 and 68.3% of total soluble metabolites. Propionic acid which is an undesirable metabolite in hydrogen fermentation was observed in very low amounts (0.0–0.5%) in all the vials. Interestingly, it was observed that the pretreatment temperature affected the ratio of butyrate to acetate (Table 4). Increasing the pretreatment temperature from 65 to 95°C in anaerobically digested sludge caused an increase in the butyrate/acetate ratio from 1.5 to 2.4. In activated sludge increasing the treatment temperature from 65 to 80°C raised the butyrate/acetate ratio from 0.9 to 1.2. Heat treatment at lower temperatures resulted in lower butyrate/acetate ratio accompanied by higher hydrogen production, which is consistent with the findings of Khanal et al. [18] and Vanandel et al. [30] who demonstrated that driving pathways towards a lower butyrate/acetate ratio (or a higher acetate/butyrate ratio), by changing environmental conditions, enhances hydrogen production. This behavior can be explained by the major metabolic reactions involved in hydrogen production through butyrate fermentation: (3) C6H12O6 +2H2O→2CH3COOH+2CO2 +4H2 (4) C6H12O6 →CH3CH2CH2COOH+2CO2 +2H2 Since the conversion of glucose to acetic acid gives a maximum yield of 4molH2/molglucose and half of this yield is obtained with conversion of glucose to butyrate, driving the glucose consumption reaction towards higher acetate (or lower butyrate/acetate ratio) will give rise to hydrogen production. The glucose removal efficiency, calculated as the difference between the initial and final glucose concentrations; and its conversion efficiency to soluble metabolites, based on the initial concentration of glucose, after 24h of incubation are shown in Table 5 . As it is illustrated in Table 5, the carbon balance on the soluble metabolites and evolved gases was satisfactorily closed within 88–97% for the pretreated inocula. It was observed that the pretreatment at 80°C resulted in faster glucose removal and lower hydrogen production. This unexpected anomaly at 80°C may be attributed to the formation of higher soluble metabolites (Table 5) which were not related to hydrogen production. As apparent from Fig. 2, at the end of fermentation glucose was completely exhausted in all of the vials except for the 95°C treated activated sludge where only 54.5% of the initial glucose was utilized."
11,Effect of pH,"3.4 Effect of pH The pH of all of the samples in batch experiments was initially buffered with 0.07M phosphate buffer and adjusted to 6.7. The final pH values for untreated inocula were about 3.4 and those of treated inocula ranged from 3.8 to 4.6 and 4.1 to 4.5 for the activated sludge and anaerobic sludge, respectively. The major pH drop in all of the samples occurred during the first 24h of fermentation (Fig. 4 ). Faster pH drop in the untreated inocula could be because of the higher production of fatty acids (Table 4). Since the activity of most methanogens is limited to a narrow pH range between 6.7 and 8 [31], the drop of pH could help the elimination of methanogenic activity in both treated and untreated inocula. It must be asserted that the difference in hydrogen yields could not be attributed to pH changes, since the pH in the anaerobic sludge pretreated at 95°C was almost identical to those pretreated at 65 and 80°C despite widely disparate hydrogen production."
12,Microbial community analysis,"3.5 Microbial community analysis The total genomic community DNA of the samples with high hydrogen production including the 65 and 80°C pretreated activated sludge and anaerobic sludge pretreated at 65, 80 and 95°C, were extracted and used for the analysis of microbial community by PCR–DGGE. The DGGE profiles of the 16S rDNA gene fragment at each treatment condition are illustrated in Fig. 5 . Table 6 shows the results of the sequence affiliation. In total, 11 bands and seven species were identified. The number of the bands detected at the lower pretreatment temperatures was more than those detected at higher pretreatment temperatures, indicating that elevated pretreatment temperatures reduce species diversity. C. acetobutyricum (band 1, 6 and 10) was detected in both activated sludge and anaerobic sludge samples. C. acetobutyricum ferments carbohydrates to hydrogen and carbon dioxide with acetate and butyrate as the main soluble metabolites [32]. C. acetobutyricum has a potential to shift from hydrogen production towards acetone and butanol production. This shift may occur at the end of the exponential growth phase. Low growth rate, low pH and high concentrations of carbohydrates have been considered as some of the factors which stimulate solvent production by C. acetobutyricum [33]. One of the bacterial species that was identified in the activated sludge inocula was Bacillus thuringiensis (band 4). Although, this bacterium has been reported as the predominant species in some activated sludge samples [34], to the knowledge of the authors, despite few reports of hydrogen production by some pure Bacillus species such as B. licheniformis and B. coagulans [35,36] or presence of other Bacillus species in mixed microflora of hydrogen-producing reactors [37,38], this species has not yet been reported in an anaerobic hydrogen production system. C. butyricum (band 5, 7 and 11) was found in all the hydrogen producing samples in this study. This species is one of the most frequently reported species in hydrogen-producing mixed cultures [39,40]. Although based on the stoichiometry, the hydrogen consumption in the pretreated activated sludge at 65 and 80°C could be because of homoacetogenesis, none of the identified bands in the DGGE profile of activated sludge samples belonged to the homoacetogenic species. It must also be added that there were other bands in the DGGE profile which were not identified."
13,Repeated batch experiments,"3.6 Repeated batch experiments In order to investigate the stability of hydrogen production with 65°C heat pretreated activated sludge and anaerobic sludge, theses sludges were operated in a repeated batch mode. Neither net hydrogen utilization nor methane and hydrogen sulfide formation was observed in the batches. Specific hydrogen production for the activated sludge substantially increased from 45mmol/gVSS in the first batch to 164mmol/gVSS in the fourth batch. The same increase in the specific hydrogen production was observed for anaerobic sludge with the corresponding values of 56–134mmol/gVSS (Fig. 6 ). These results show the effectiveness of heat treatment at 65°C for these two inocula. The metabolites measured at the end of each batch, indicated that other than ethanol which was in the range of 81–1607mg/L in the activated sludge and 92–133mg/L in the anaerobic sludge, there were no observed differences between the two sludges throughout the four consecutive batches."
14,Conclusions,"The results of this work demonstrated that the hydrogen yield, hydrogen production rate and microbial community were influenced by various heat pretreatment temperatures and this effect depended on the type of the inocula. Pretreatment at 65°C resulted in the highest hydrogen yield as well as the highest hydrogen production rates in both the activated sludge (1.6molhydrogen/molglucose and 19.3mL/h) and anaerobic sludge (2.3molhydrogen/molglucose and 26.3mL/h). Pretreatment at higher temperatures resulted in lower hydrogen production yields and rates and was accompanied by higher butyrate/acetate ratio. When the pretreatment temperature was increased to 95°C in the activated sludge, hydrogen production was suppressed and metabolic pathways were observed to shift towards lactic acid formation. Our repeated batch experiments with the inocula treated at 65°C illustrated a good stability of the process during four consecutive batches. The analysis of microbial communities showed that elevated pretreatment temperatures reduced species diversity."
