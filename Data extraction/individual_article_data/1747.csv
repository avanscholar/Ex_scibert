0,Introduction,"Greenhouse gases, though caused a series environmental issues and ecosystem changes, could be reasonably used on the other side [1]. Conversion of CO2 into chemical blocks sound like a promising approach to suppress the climate change [2,3]. As an abundant, inexpensive, low-toxic, non-inflammable and renewable carbon feedstock, growing concerns to the chemical fixation of CO2 have been raised [4–6]. Under the trend of atomic economy and green chemistry, one of the most effective ways to CO2 chemical fixation under relatively mild conditions is the cycloaddition reaction between CO2 and epoxy compounds to form five-membered cyclic carbonates. Known as familiar chemicals, cyclic carbonates are widely used as polar aprotic solvents, intermediates for organic and polymeric synthesis, and ingredients for chemicals in biomedical applications [7–11]. Synthesis of amino-alcohol compounds by amination reaction of cyclic carbonates is a feasible utilization for it [12,13]. As known to all, amino-alcohol compounds can be used as an important raw material for polyurethane (PU) preparation and has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their good processing performance and excellent mechanical properties [14–16]. In our previous study, novel amino-alcohol compounds with two amino and two hydroxyl groups different from traditional amino-alcohol chain extenders were prepared and used as chain extender in solvent-based PU [17]. Among various PU materials, waterborne polyurethane (WPU) aroused more and more attentions now because of the low volatile organic compounds (VOC) emission and cleaner production process. Typically, ionic groups are introduced into WPU structure to improve its water-solubility, such as dimethyl propionic acid, sulfonic acid and so on. WPUs presented many advantages compared with conventional PUs and have been widely used as environmental materials such as coating, adhesive and so on [18–20]. But unfortunately, due to the presence of hydrophilic ionic groups in the structure, water and solvent resistance of WPU reduced comparing to traditional organic solvent dispersed PUs. Efforts have been done to resolve the issue either on the development of synthetic technology or on the design of molecular structures, such as modification by silicone, introduction of polycarbonate diols and so on [21–26]. Besides the above methods, Figvosky and his coworkers reported that H-bonds derived from the aminolysis of five-membered cyclic carbonate could improve solvent-resistance of non-isocynate polyurethane [27]. So, introduction of hydroxyl groups into WPU followed this way might be helpful to improve the hydrolysis repellency. So far as we know, the utilization of amino-alcohol formed by aminolysis of cyclic carbonate as chain extender to the preparation of WPU has rarely been reported. In this study, the feasibility of CO2-based amino-alcohol compound as chain extender to prepare environment-friendly WPU was investigated. On the one hand, the rapid reaction rate of amine group in amino-alcohol is suitable for the chain extension of WPU system; on the other hand, hydroxyl groups maintained in the system might helpful to solvent-resistance of WPUs. The water/solvent resistance and hydrolysis/oxidation resistance of WPUs were highlighted by contrast with ethylenediamine (EDA) based WPUs. Moreover, other performances like mechanical and thermal properties were also studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals 2, 2-dimethylol propionic acid (DMPA), sodium hydroxide and 1, 2-ethylenediamine (EDA) were purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd. 1, 4-butanediol (BDO), trimethylamine (TEA), acetone and hydrogen peroxide solution (30%) were purchased from Sinopharm Group Co., Ltd. 1, 4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDODGE) was provided by Wuhan Yuanchen technology Co., Ltd. 2, 4-toluene diisocynate (TDI-100) was purchased from Cangzhou Dahua Co., Ltd (China). Polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMG-1000) with molecular weights of 1000 was supplied by Yantai Hua Da chemical industry Co., Ltd (China) and was dehydrated under vacuum at 130 °C for 2 h."
3,Preparation of CO2-based amino-alcohol chain extender,"2.2 Preparation of CO2-based amino-alcohol chain extender The CO2-based amino-alcohol chain extender (CO2-AA) was prepared as follows. Firstly, BDODGE (100.00 g, 0.50 mol) and basic polystyrene resin catalyst D296 (10.00 g) were charged into a high pressure autoclave. After purging by N2 for 10 min and heated to 120 °C, CO2 was pressurized into the autoclave and maintained at 10 bar for 30 h under stirring. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtrated to separate the formed cyclic carbonate BDO-5CC. Furtherly, excessive EDA was added to BDO-5CC at 90 °C for 6 h under stirring. Finally, the unreacted EDA was removed under vacuum. Amine-terminated structure of CO2-AA was guaranteed by the excess of ethylenediamine or ratio of BDO-5CC/EDA. Structures of products after each step were analyzed by FT-IR, 1H NMR and chemical titration."
4,Preparation of CO2-based WPU,"2.3 Preparation of CO2-based WPU CO2-based WPU was synthesized according to the acetone method (Scheme 1 ) [28]. Firstly, 10.0 g PTMG-1000, 7.22 g TDI and 1.50 g DMPA were charged into a 250 mL four-necked flask equipped with thermometer, mechanical stirrer, condenser and dry nitrogen inlet. Under dry nitrogen flowing, the mixture was heated to 80 °C and kept acting for 2 h. Then, cooled down to 55 °C, charged 0.60 g BDO into the system and continued to react for another 2 h to increase the hard segments of WPU. Hard segment of WPU was the diisocyanate compounds, chain extenders and the added small molecular diols. Secondly, adding 1.14 g TEA at 30 °C to neutralize the product for 10 min. In the end, a certain amount of distilled water and 32.98 g 19% (wt %) CO2-AA solution was added after well mixed under vigorous stirring for 30 min. The acetone was removed at 30-40 °C for 1 h under reduced pressure, and finally the CO2-based WPU was acquired (with 20.49% solid content). For reference, CO2-AA was replaced by EDA for preparing WPUs by the same procedure. During the reaction, an appropriate amount of acetone was added to reduce the viscosity of the products, furthermore, the products of every step were detected with dibutylamine back-titration method and monitored by FT-IR."
5,Preparation of WPU films,"2.4 Preparation of WPU films WPU films were prepared by pouring the WPU emulsion into a polytetrafluoroethylene mold, followed by placing it at room temperature for 24 h, kept under infrared light for 20 h and finally dried in an oven maintained at 40 °C for 12 h."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization All the FT-IR spectra were obtained on a NICOLET-380 Fourier transform infrared instrument using KBr or CaF2 crystal plate. Structures were further confirmed on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrometer. Zeta potentials were measured by a Nano-ZS90 zeta-potential analyzer using the electrophoresis principle. WPU dispersions were firstly diluted to 0.5 wt% with deionized water before measurement at 25 °C. Mechanical properties of the WPUs were measured on a CMT6503 instrument at a cross-head rate of 200 mm/min. Thermal stabilities of the materials were studied employing a TA-60WS instrument with a heating rate of 10 °C/min under N2 atmosphere. The storage modulus E′, loss modulus E″ and mechanical loss factor tan δ of the films were recorded by DMTA-Q800 at a frequency of 1 Hz with an amplitude of 20 μm in the temperature range of −75 to 150 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Resistance to chemical solvents/water and hydrolysis/oxidation was evaluated by the soaking method. Approximately 0.20 g films were placed into different solvents, including water and solutions of 5.00 wt% HCl, 5.00 wt% NaOH until equilibrium was attained at 25 °C, respectively. The degree of swelling (Ds) of the WPUs was determined by measuring the weight of the initial material (m0) and the material after swelling (ms) using the following equation. (1) D s = m s - m 0 m 0 × 100%"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structure and properties of WPU,"3.1 Structure and properties of WPU 3.1.1 Characterization for CO2-AA and products after each step for WPU synthesis FT-IR and 1H NMR analysis were employed to investigate chemical structures of the CO2-AA and products after each step, the results were shown in Fig. 1 . From the FT-IR spectra of CO2-AA, the characteristic absorption peak of carbonyl group in urethane group at 1709 cm−1, NH plane bending vibration peak of primary amine at 1534 cm−1 and CN stretching vibrational peak of aliphatic amine at 1252 cm−1 were observed, which indicated the formation of amine and urethane structure. For the alcohol structure, the broad peak around 3341 cm−1 might be the overlaid peaks of NH and OH which blocked the identification of hydroxyl group. However, the absorption peak at 1105 cm−1 corresponding to the CO stretching vibration showed be related to the formation of OH and further confirmed by 1H NMR spectra. By comparison between the 1H NMR spectra of CO2-AA in two different solvents DMSO and D2O, the most obvious difference was peaks at 7.17, 6.11 and 4.68 ppm which was assigned to the active hydrogens of primary amine, secondary amine and hydroxyl group in the structure (except for peaks of solvents). As to the hydroxyl group at 4.68 ppm, the peak curved bread on account of the slow rate of proton exchanging, which was influenced by the interaction of the hydrogen bonding between molecular and intermolecular. Furthermore, other chemical shifts corresponded to protons of methylene and methine in the compound could also be found in the spectrum. Moreover, from the FT-IR spectra of endpoint for each step in the synthesis of WPU, the absorption peaks were similar except for the disappearance of stretching vibration of NCO group in step 4, illustrating the accomplishment of chain extension reaction. According to the combination of FT-IR and 1H NMR spectra, the CO2-AA and WPU emulsion were successfully synthesized. Furthermore, the results of elemental analysis also showed that the composition of the synthetic compound was similar to the target product. 3.1.2 Characterization for WPU films The solid-state NMR spectroscopy was furtherly used to confirm structures of WPU film prepared from CO2-AA. As shown in Fig. 2 , the peak at 4.02 ppm proved the existence of OH in WPU. It confirmed that the hydroxyl group could be reserved after the polymerization reaction due to the much faster reacting rate between NCO and NH2 than that with OH. Furthermore, although the relatively lower resolution of solid nuclear magnetism, other structures in WPU film could also be identified in the spectra. Wherein, chemical shifts and the corresponding groups were as follows: 1.52 (methyl), 3.32 (methylene), 5.10 (methylene), 6.96 and 7.35 (benzene ring), 8.19 (secondary amine). 3.1.3 Characteristics of WPU dispersions It was obvious in Fig. 3 (A) that the viscosities of samples were relatively small and the EDA-based dispersion showed the smallest. Viscosity of polymer emulsion is related to the volume fraction, radius of latex ions, thickness of surface absorption layer, number of latex particles, distance between particles and degree of interaction between the particles and medium. The possible reason might be at the same content of hydrophilic groups: on the one hand, the radiuses of EDA-based WPU particles were smaller; on the other hand, the interaction between polymer particles and water molecules was weaker on account of fewer interacting groups in the molecules. While there were stronger affinity between the CO2-AA based particles and water molecules, consequently the viscosity were larger. Moreover, the viscosity augmented with the extension of time due to smaller emulsion particle agglomeration over time. The particle size distribution of the WPU dispersions prepared by CO2-AA was measured by particle size analyzer and result was shown in Fig. 3(B). It was observed that the particle size distribution was smaller in size and narrower in distribution which indicated that the reaction and formed particles were uniform under the smaller viscosity and favorable to stable storage. WPU dispersions prepared under different conditions were shown in Fig. S1. In addtion, the appearance of each WPU emulsions didn’t change much over time, particles still uniform without precipitate and delamination which indicated a better storage stability, the pot life of WPU dispersions were more than 6 months. Stability of the WPU dispersions was also measured by Zeta potential. Surface of WPU particles were spherical with a charged swelling layer. Due to the presence of hydrophilic groups, particles distributed in the solution evenly and adsorbed ions with opposite charges to maintain the stability of emulsion by charge repulsion with forming the double electric layer. Zeta potential played an important role in measuring the interaction between emulsion particles. The smaller the size of emulsion particles, the greater the absolute value of Zeta potential and the better the dispersion stability of WPU emulsion, that is, WPU particle could resist aggregation in this situation. Zeta potential was less negative of the WPU dispersions as the chain extender changed to BDCE (Table 1 ). The hydroxyl groups in BDCE promoted the hydrogen bonding of the system and enhanced the interaction between molecules, so that the particle size and aggregation were larger than EDA. As to the pH values, since hydrophilic monomer of the WPUs was DMPA, the main functional group was carboxyl group and the ammonium carboxylate generated after neutralization would hydrolyze which lead to a weakly alkaline dispersion."
9,Mechanical properties of WPU films,"3.2 Mechanical properties of WPU films The mechanical properties of WPU films with different compositions of chain extenders and polyols were investigated by tensile test at room temperature. The results were shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2 . The difference in mechanical properties was ascribed to distinctions in WPU structures and both CO2-based WPU films showed higher Ts and Eb. Compared with the ether groups in PTMG, ester groups demonstrated stronger polarity which facilitated formation of more hydrogen bond. In addition, the rigid carbonate groups in PCDL might increase the rigidity of WPU and consequently, WPU film from PCDL demonstrated higher Ts (31.5 MPa) [29]. With regard to the different chain extenders, the specific structure of CO2-AA would be responsible for the higher Ts and Eb of CO2-AA based WPU films. In the chain extension process, amine groups in CO2-AA participated in the reaction while hydroxyl groups reserved in WPU system. The presence of hydroxyl groups could strengthen hydrogen bonding interaction in and among the molecules thus enhanced the cohesion energy of polymer chain segments, leading to a higher Ts than EDA-based WPU [30]. Besides, more H-bonds in the system further increased number of cross-links and leading to a higher Eb."
10,Water/solvent resistance and hydrolysis/oxidation resistance of WPU films,"3.3 Water/solvent resistance and hydrolysis/oxidation resistance of WPU films 3.3.1 Water/solvent resistance: Ds of WPU films in water and different solvents The water/solvent resistance and hydrolysis/oxidation resistance of CO2-WPU and EDA-WPU were measured by immersed the samples into water and the different solvents. Ds of each WPU in water and the PCDL-based WPU film in different solvents were shown in Fig. 5 . The water resistance varied along with composition of WPUs. Overall, the CO2-AA based WPU exhibited better water resistance and PCDL-WPU performed best. The PCDL-WPU swelled to 12.03% after 9 days and changed slightly with continuous immersion with no remarkable changes in appearance. The PTMG-WPU displayed the similar trend, while it swelled to 42.98% and the films turned white in water. In contrast to CO2-AA based WPU, the EDA-based WPU showed poor water resistance. Once putting the films in water, they began to dissolve with the water turned white and the film turned yellow and shrinking dramatically in the solution after 4 h as shown in S2. Besides the water absorption, resistances of PCDL-based WPU to solvents with various polarities were also investigated and the results were shown in Fig. 5(B). It can be found that samples exhibit low absorption to acid, base accompanied by no breakages in organic solvents. Overall, the relatively lower degree of swelling for the WPU materials proved a reasonably fine environmental stability. Distinction in the structures might be responsible for the difference in water absorption. The special structure of CO2-AA might explain the better performance in water for WPU films. Compared with EDA, the reserved hydroxyl groups from CO2-AA in the film could strengthen the hydrogen bonding, which further enhanced the tight arrangement of molecules thus improving the stability to water. Furthermore, the possible hydrogen bond existed between hydrogen atom in hydroxyl group and the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group next to it would stabilize the ester group and improved the water resistance. From another perspective, the fairly larger molecular weight of CO2-AA and a small amount of crosslinking caused by the reaction between NCO and OH were beneficial to water resistance, too. Compared with PTMG, the central carbon atom in PCDL had lower electron density, so it couldn’t be polarized by water molecules easily. Furthermore, the carbonyl groups with strong polarity in PCDL were easily to form H-bonds in hard segments which lead to increase in intermolecular forces. In addition, larger rigidity of carbonate group increased the rigidity of molecular structure and might form crystallization, thus enhancing the density of products with compact molecules chains, so water molecules were hard to penetrate into the WPU films. FT-IR was employed to investigate variation in structure of the WPU films in water. The results were illustrated in Fig. 6 for the original WPU film and solution of WPUs after immersed in water, respectively. It was observed that the spectra of EDA-WPU was similar to the original WPU film while the CO2-AA based exhibited relatively larger difference and there was basically no infrared absorption in the spectra. Furthermore, the most vulnerable bond carbamate and ether could still be seen in the spectra of AI-PTMG+TDI+EDA at 1081 cm−1 and 1717 cm−1. So it can be concluded that structure of EDA-WPU in water wasn’t changed, reason for the variety in appearance and performances was the dissolution of polymer molecules. Further, the linear structure of EDA-WPU might be responsible for the dissolution. While for CO2-AA WPU, the solution was clear and transparent after the process (Fig. S2). In addition, there was no infrared absorption peak of CO2-AA WPU in the spectra which meant barely no CO2-AA WPU dissolved in the water which could be attributed to the stabilization of H-bonds formed by hydroxyl groups in CO2-AA. 3.3.2 Water/solvent resistance: Retention rate of WPU films’ Ts and Eb in water and retention rate of mechanical properties for PCDL-WPU in different solvents Retention rates of Ts and Eb for the three WPU films in water were shown in Fig. 7 . The retention rates of Ts and Eb for CO2-AA WPU were preferable which indicated a better resistance to water. However, the EDA-WPU dissolved apparently in water. The EDA-WPU films turned soft and gooey with no mechanical strength only immersed in water for 5 h. On the other hand, the PTMG-WPU swelled obviously with films turning white, but the Ts and Eb retention were much better than the EDA films. The fairly lower retention of PTMG-WPU and EDA-WPU was due to swelling and dissolution of the films. Since large amounts of water molecules penetrated into the interior of material, internal structure of the membrane was destroyed and so the mechanical properties declined. In conclusion, CO2-AA enhanced the water resistance of WPU films to a certain extent and could obtain materials with excellent performances under the suitable formula. Solvent resistance of CO2-AA WPU could be studied in Fig. 7 where Ts and Eb retention rate for PCDL-WPU in different solvents were listed. Note that the PCDL-WPU showed better resistance to solvents, especially to acid. The retention rates of Ts and Eb in acid changed slightly after immersed in the solution for 5 h. The film also exhibited better resistance to toluene which meant a certain improvement of CO2-AA WPU to the traditional EDA-WPUs. However, the resistance against acetone was fairly poor with the largest decrease in Ts and Eb, which might be influenced by the similar solubility parameter between WPU and acetone. So acetone could easily permeate into the films and consequently accelerated decrease in mechanical properties. 3.3.3 Hydrolysis/oxidation resistance: 0.25% NaOH and 6.00% H2O2 solution Hydrolysis/oxidation resistance of the WPUs was evaluated by retention rates of Ts and Eb in 0.25% NaOH and 6.00% H2O2 solution which was shown in Table 3 . The NaOH solution was used to investigate hydrolysis repellency and H2O2 solution was served for study of oxidation resistance. For the hydrolysis repellency in 0.25% NaOH, after immersed in the solutions for 5 h, Ts and Eb of CO2-AA based WPUs changed slightly and PCDL-WPU showed the best result only with little swelling and softens. Moreover, it’s interesting that the Eb increased to some extent, reason for that might be the penetration of small amount of solvent molecules into WPU films, causing the plasticization effect and accordingly increasing toughness and elongation of the materials. Except for the ether groups in PTMG, CO2-AA also played an important role for the resistance to hydrolysis. Explanations were shown in S3 and our previous study, the hydrogen bonding in WPUs were investigated by the FT-IR in S4 which a larger HBI value meaning for larger extent of hydrogen bonding in CO2-AA based WPU was calculated [17,31–34]. As to the oxidation resistance in 6.00% H2O2 solution, varieties of Ts and Eb retention were similar to the hydrolysis repellency along time except the fairly poor resistance of PTMG-WPU to oxidation. By comparison, PCDL-WPU, due to the existence of ester groups, it showed the better oxidation resistance. On the whole, the CO2-AA based WPU exhibited better hydrolysis and oxidation repellency than EDA-WPU, especially the PCDL-WPU showed considerably better performances, benefiting from the specific structure of CO2-AA and the carbonate and ether groups in the PCDL chain. 3.3.4 Calculation of surface energy for WPU films Through the combination of Young's equation and Fowkes approach for surface energy component method, surface energy of the WPU films can be calculated from the following formula, (2) γ s = γ s d + γ s p (3) γ L 1 + cos θ = 4 γ S d γ L d γ S d + γ L d + 4 γ S p γ L p γ S p + γ L p in which θ represents for the contact angle of reagent on the surface of WPU films, γ s p and γ s d meaning for polar and dispersive component of the surface energy of WPU films. γ L p and γ L d represent for polar and dispersive component of the surface energy of reagents, which for deionized water they were 51.0 mJ/m2, 21.8 mJ/m2 and for ethylene glycol they were 19.0 mJ/m2, 29.3 mJ/m2, respectively. Then after measurement of the contact angle of deionized water and ethylene glycol on the WPU films, surface energy of WPU films could be calculated according to the equations. Surface energy of WPU films were presented in Table 4 . CO2-AA based WPU films exhibited smaller surface energy; however, the surface energy and contact angle of different WPU films had little difference. The surface energy of films mainly related to the surface chemical composition and the results in surface energy might be caused by the following reason: chain extenders didn’t concentrate on surface of the films, so the change of chain extender didn’t have great impact on surface of the material. Therefore, explanation for the improved solvent resistance lay in strengthening of hydrogen bonding and protection of weak bonds in the system by the special internal structure formed by CO2-AA mentioned above."
11,Thermal properties of CO2-WPU,"3.4 Thermal properties of CO2-WPU The results of TG and DTG profiles of WPU films under nitrogen were shown in Fig. 8 and summarized in Table 5 . The two stages of thermal decomposition of the WPUs could be evidently seen from DTG curves. Outset of the first step for CO2-AA WPUs was around 190 °C and completed around 370 °C corresponding to breakages of the unstable ester, urethane and urea bonds to primary or second amines, olefin, and dioxide in the hard segments [35,36]. The percentages of weight loss at 370 °C for PTMG-WPU, PCDL-WPU and EDA-WPU were 49.3%, 67.5% and 42.1%, respectively. Second stage of degradation corresponded to breakages of the methylene and other bonds in soft segment was started at 370 °C and ended at about 500 °C. Soft segment of WPU was the composition of polymer diols. Comparison of characteristic decomposition data from Table 5 indicated that the Tmax values of these three WPUs were similar to each other. Differences on weight loss of these two degradation stages were in agreement with molecular structures of WPU films. In the first stage, initial decomposition temperatures of WPUs differs from 185 to 211 °C. The initial decomposition temperatures of CO2-AA WPUs for the first stage were lower than EDA. While for the second-stage degradation, no obvious distinction among them was observed. Distinction in the initial decomposition temperatures might be due to urethane groups in CO2-AA which didn’t exist in EDA. When compared with urea groups, the higher polarity, hydrogen bonding capacity and dissociation energy of the urea bonds all had positive effect on thermos-stability. So the initial decomposition temperature of EDA-WPU was higher than CO2-AA. Moreover, because of the existence of isomers in CO2-AA, the biggish purity of hard segment in EDA-WPU contributed to the increase of degradation temperature."
12,DMA properties of CO2-WPU,"3.5 DMA properties of CO2-WPU The microphase separation could influence mechanical properties of polymers to some extent. For WPU, the microphase separation was mainly due to the incompatibility of soft and hard segments. Study of the transition temperature of WPUs based on DMA test could reveal the degree of microphase separation. The dependence of storage modulus (E′), loss modulus (E″) and loss factor (tanδ) on temperature were presented in Fig. 9 . E′ and E″ curves obviously revealed that the storage modulus and loss modulus of PCDL-WPU were higher than others which were attributed to the structure of carbonate groups in PCDL. There’re lone pair electrons in the carbonate oxygen, which were more easily to form hydrogen bond with the NH in hard segments comparing with ether oxygen. Furthermore, the ester groups had larger polarity which enhanced the interaction between molecules, so the PCDL-WPU had a relatively high storage modulus. Further, because of the strong intermolecular interaction in PCDL-WPU, the relaxation movements among polymer chain segment were limited and then lead to the increase in loss modulus. In addition, since there’re hydroxyl groups reserved in the CO2-AA WPU, they not only form H-bonds inter- and intra-molecular but also result steric hindrance for the movement of chain segment. Hence the loss moduli of CO2-AA WPUs were fairly larger. Tanδ curves illustrated the microphase separation of different WPUs as shown in Fig. 9(C). Note that the PCDL-WPU obviously showed two peaks in tanδ with a low relaxation temperature at around 34 °C and a high relaxation temperature at 78 °C, corresponding to the glass transition of the soft and hard segments, respectively [37]. It meant the formation of microphase separation structure in PCDL and could be deduced that, the reserved hydroxyl groups from CO2-AA and the lager polarity of carbonate group enlarged the microphase separation degree and enhanced the mechanical properties of PCDL-WPU."
13,Conclusion,"Green waterborne polyurethane from CO2 derived amino-alcohol was successfully synthesized. The WPU dispersions with smaller viscosity and narrow distribution possessed good stability. The amino and alcohol groups in CO2-AA structure, especially the hydroxyls can be reserved in the WPUs and enhance hydrogen bonding of the system, which endows the WPU with promising water/solvents resistance, hydrolysis repellency and oxidation repellency. In addition, surface energy of different WPU films had little difference and the CO2-based WPU showed considerable mechanical and thermal properties."
