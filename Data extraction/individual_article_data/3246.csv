0,Introduction,"Energy is an indispensable and important foundation for economic development of the countries as well as the material basis for the survival and development of mankind. However, the excessive depletion of conventional fossil fuels well known as the non-renewable energy sources has brought about the shortage of energy and some serious environmental problems, particularly global warming due to the massive emission of greenhouse gases [1]. To deal with these concerns, seeking and exploiting green renewable energy sources as the alternatives to fossil fuels is urgent for both governments and scientists. Biodiesel, as renewable and environment-friendly bioenergy with wide sources of raw materials such as animal fats, vegetable and waste oils, has attracted considerable attention and was regarded as a promising alternative to petroleum-based fuels [2]. Compared with petroleum fuel, biodiesel has lower exhaust emissions, higher flash point and cetane number [3]. It is noteworthy that the physicochemical property of biodiesel is related to the component contained in biodiesel and its degree of unsaturation. Biodiesel comprising the compositions that have a high degree of unsaturation exhibits well cold flow property; on the contrary, the corresponding oxidation stability (OS) and ignition quality presented were poor [4]. Because of this, the monounsaturated composition in biodiesel is the desired component of high-quality biodiesel. Generally, the biodiesel produced via the most common method of transesterification contains a great number of polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl ester (FAMEs), which is detrimental to the quality of product [5]. Therefore, for achieving the desired properties of biodiesel, partial hydrogenation of biodiesel has been employed widely as an effective way to transform the polyunsaturated FAMEs into monounsaturated FAMEs, and meanwhile, maintain the saturated FAMEs generated as minimum as possible. Conventional hydrogenation of FAMEs in biodiesel using hydrogen gas as hydrogen source has been studied extensively and exhibited a prominent effect to reduce the content of polyunsaturated FAMEs [6]. Nevertheless, the required hydrogenation conditions of high temperature and pressure for conventional hydrogenation may lead to high equipment costs as well as the formation of undesired trans-isomer during the procedure of hydrogenation [7]. As reported by Zhu et al. [8], partial hydrogenation of Jatropha oil biodiesel was performed with a nickel/bentonite catalyst at high temperature of 200 °C and a hydrogen pressure of 0.3 MPa. Under these operating conditions, a conspicuous increase in the content of trans-methyl oleate by 24.06 wt% was observed for the hydrogenated Jatropha oil biodiesel. Due to the flammability and explosibility of hydrogen gas and the strict demand for the operating condition of conventional hydrogenation, it is necessary to seek an alternative hydrogenation way to reduce the content of polyunsaturated FAMEs. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) is a safe and economical method for the hydrogenation of FAMEs [9]. Compared with conventional hydrogenation, CTH using hydrogen donor as the source of hydrogen can be conducted under mild reaction conditions [10]. And, the mild hydrogenation conditions are beneficial to the enhancement of the selectivity for the composition in the hydrogenated product. Hadiah et al. [11] studied the CTH of candlenut oil with Ag–Ni/SiO2 as hydrogenation catalyst and potassium formate as hydrogen donor. It was found that under the reaction temperature of 78 °C, the candlenut oil could be hydrogenated efficiently. Tike and Mahajani [12] investigated the hydrogenation of soybean oil using Pd/C as catalyst via the conventional hydrogenation approach at the temperature of 150 °C; and similarly, via the CTH approach at the temperature of 90 °C. It was found by Tike and Mahajani that the lower content of trans-isomer was formed in the CTH process compared with that in conventional hydrogenation. Therefore, CTH can achieve the hydrogenation of FAMEs in mild conditions, and it is a promising alternative approach for conventional hydrogenation using hydrogen gas. However, the CTH reaction of FAMEs usually presents a slow process of hydrogenation and requires a long hydrogenation time due to the heterogeneous system in the CTH reaction [13]. To accelerate the hydrogenation process of CTH and reduce the reaction time, the approaches of process intensification can be applied to the CTH of FAMEs [14]. Ultrasound, as a common and effective method of process intensification, has been studied and applied progressively in chemical processes [15]. Specific chemical reactions can be accelerated due to the physical effects produced in the ultrasound system, such as mass transfer effect, thermal effect and cavitation effect [16]. When the ultrasonic wave is propagated in the reaction medium, immense energy of ultrasound generated owing to vibration can be absorbed by the reaction medium and converted into thermal energy, thereby causing the increase in the temperature of reaction medium [17]. In addition, with the vibration of the liquid medium, a mass of bubbles are formed in the liquid medium and kept continual movement and expansion. Some bubbles collapse violently in a short period of time due to the expansion to the unstable critical state, which leads to the intense local high temperature and high pressure in the reaction system [18]. In the meantime, the quick collapse of bubbles in the liquid medium can result in the generation of the physical effect of turbulence, thus enhancing the mass transfer rate in the system [19]. These typical features of ultrasound reveal the feasibility of process intensification for the CTH reaction under mild reaction conditions. In the process with ultrasound, a special reaction environment for chemical reactions can be realized. Sancheti and Gogate [20] reported the selective hydrogenation of soybean oil with the assistance of ultrasound using Pd/C as catalyst and ammonium formate as hydrogen donor. Therefore, use of ultrasound could present prominent process intensification effects for the CTH of FAMEs. Another critical factor determining the efficiency of CTH is the catalyst used in hydrogenation. Compared with the noble metal catalysts with high production cost, Ni-based catalysts investigated extensively are more economical to be used for the CTH due to their low prices and high catalytic activity [21]. However, for amorphous nickel-boride catalyst (Ni–B), the particles of the catalyst are easy to be aggregated, leading to the reduction of its catalytic activity [22]. Based on the literature reported, the catalyst of Ni–B can be modified by adding an extra metal as promoter to form a bimetallic catalyst for avoiding the agglomeration of Ni–B catalyst and hence maintaining high catalytic activity [23]. Bai et al. [24] have investigated the selective hydrogenation of benzophenone using Ni–B catalyst and La-doped Ni–B catalyst (denoted as Ni–La–B). It was found that after the adding of metal La into the Ni–B catalyst, the prepared Ni–La–B catalyst exhibited more active sites and smaller particle sizes than Ni–B catalyst, and the conversion of benzophenone increased distinctly by using the Ni–La–B catalyst. Consequently, considering the cost and high catalytic activity of the catalyst, Ni–La–B amorphous alloy catalyst was chosen as the catalyst for the CTH of FAMEs in this work. In this study, for achieving effective hydrogenation of FAMEs that having a high degree of unsaturation under low temperature, ultrasound was applied in the CTH of FAMEs to intensify the hydrogenation process, using Ni–La–B as catalyst, sodium borohydride as hydrogen donor and water as solvent. The operating parameters affecting the process of CTH were studied in detail to establish the optimum hydrogenation conditions. Moreover, to find the advantage by using ultrasound in CTH of FAMEs, a comparative study of the ultrasound-assisted approach with the conventional approach and the ultrasound approach has been conducted. The comparison results demonstrated that the use of ultrasound in the CTH reaction could enhance the hydrogenation conversion ratio of FAMEs and reduce the hydrogenation time, achieving the effective CTH of FAMEs at low temperature and gaining the hydrogenated product with good performance. Furthermore, the effect of ultrasound on the Ni–La–B catalyst when used in the CTH was analyzed based on the characterization of catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2•6H2O, ≥98%), used as a Ni precursor, was obtained from Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, China. Lanthanum nitrate (La(NO3)3•6H2O, ≥96%) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4, ≥96%) were procured from Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co., Ltd., China. Fatty acid (chemical pure), purchased from China Chemical Fine Branch, was used to synthesize the raw FAMEs. All the chemicals, with the original grade, were directly used without further purification. The raw FAMEs were synthesized through the esterification of linoleic acid with methyl alcohol, according to the previously reported method [25]. The synthesized FAMEs contained 1.93 wt% of methyl palmitate (C16:0), 78.32 wt% of methyl linoleate (C18:2), 16.63 wt% of cis-methyl oleate (c-C18:1), 2.29 wt% of trans-methyl oleate (t-C18:1) and 0.83 wt% of methyl stearate (C18:0)."
3,Preparation of catalyst,"2.2 Preparation of catalyst In this work, a chemical reduction method was used for the preparation of Ni–La–B amorphous alloy catalyst. A certain amount of NiCl2•6H2O was first dissolved in the deionized water to obtain 0.6 M of aqueous nickel chloride. And then a specific amount of La(NO3)3•6H2O (at the La/Ni molar ratio = 1:20) as the precursor of modifier La was added into the solution of nickel ions to form a homogeneous mixed solution. After that, 0.6 M of NaBH4 solution (pH=12) was prepared as reductant and added dropwise into the mixture for a reduction reaction in an ice-water bath. The molar ratio of nickel to boron was 1:2 to achieve the complete reduction of nickel ions. During the reduction reaction, some hydrogen bubbles were generated in the solution, which was attributed to the hydrolysis of small amount of NaBH4. The reaction progressed until the bubbles ceased. After the reaction, the black precipitate, which was Ni–La–B catalyst, was obtained through centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 3 min. And then the catalyst of Ni-La-B was washed with deionized water several times."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The structure of the prepared catalyst was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, SmartLab 3KW). The XRD pattern was obtained with CuKα radiation as an X-ray source operated at 40Kv, 30MA. The morphology of the catalyst was studied by Quanta 400FEG scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the corresponding chemical compositions in the catalyst were obtained via the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. The structure and morphology were further measured by Tecnai G2 F20 transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR, DTGS KBr) were applied to analyze the carbon deposition on the surface of Ni–La–B catalyst with the spectral resolution of 2 cm−1 in the range of 4000–500 cm−1. And using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in the air atmosphere with the flow rate of 50 mL/min, the amount of carbon deposition on the surface of Ni–La–B catalyst was investigated. The temperature of the TGA measurements rose from 30 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C /min."
5,Catalytic transfer hydrogenation of FAMEs,"2.4 Catalytic transfer hydrogenation of FAMEs Ultrasound-assisted catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reaction of FAMEs was conducted, using Ni–La–B as catalyst and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as hydrogen donor, in a 250 ml three-necked round-bottomed flask. A certain amount of NaBH4 was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water to prepare the aqueous solution of hydrogen donor. And then the hydrogen donor solution and a certain amount of prepared Ni–La–B catalyst were added successively into the 250 mL round bottom flask containing 7 g of FAMEs. Next, after loading all reactants, the flask was fixed in an ultrasonic bath (Model KX-1740QT, 120 W, 40 kHz) with a temperature-controlled system. The ultrasound-assisted CTH reaction was performed in the ultrasonic water bath at a constant temperature of 35 °C with a mechanical stirring device. The ultrasound conditions of 120 W as power and 40 kHz as frequency remained constant during reaction. When the reaction was finished, the products were poured into a separatory funnel for the separation of oil and water phases. The separated upper oil phase containing the hydrogenated FAMEs was collected for the further measurement of the constituents. During the ultrasound-assisted CTH reaction, the effects of different process conditions, such as reaction temperature, agitation speed, reaction time, pH value of the reaction solution, catalyst dosage and hydrogen donor amount, on the hydrogenation of FAMEs were investigated. Moreover, except for reaction time, under the optimum conditions of ultrasound-assisted CTH, the CTH reactions were respectively conducted with only mechanical agitation (without the ultrasound) in the thermostatic water bath and with only ultrasound in the ultrasonic bath (without the mechanical agitation), i.e. the conventional approach of CTH and the ultrasound approach of CTH, respectively. All the experiments of CTH were repetitively carried out three times to ensure the reliability of the experimental results."
6,Product analysis,"2.5 Product analysis The samples of raw FAMEs and hydrogenated FAMEs were tested by using a 1690A gas chromatography (GC) (Kexiao experimental instrument co., Led, Hangzhou, China) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.5 μm capillary column (AT.SE-30). The components of samples were quantitatively analyzed according to the method of GC previously reported in our study [26]. And the test result of each sample was obtained by averaging thrice measurement data with the experimental errors within 5%. The saturated compositions of the raw FAMEs, including the methyl hexadecanoate (C16:0) and the methyl stearate (C18:0), had low contents, which were 1.93% and 0.83%, respectively. The polyunsaturated C18:2 FAME with its high level in the raw FAMEs could be transformed into the desired monounsaturated FAMEs via the partial CTH reaction. The conversion ratio of C18:2 composition (CR C182,%) in the hydrogenated FAMEs was used to evaluate the hydrogenation progress of the CTH reaction, which was calculated according to Eq. (1): (1) C R C 182 = ( C 0 − C 1 ) × 100 % C 0 where C 0 and C 1 are the initial content of C18:2 in the raw FAMEs and the content of C18:2 after hydrogenation, respectively. The iodine value (IV, g iodine /100 g FAMEs), reflecting the unsaturation of FAMEs, was computed using Eq. (2) based on American Oil Chemists Society (AOCS) test method [27]. (2) I V = S ( a i × f i ) where ai was the mass fraction of the i th FAME composition in the sample, and fi was the corresponding impact factor of the i th FAME composition. Table 1 lists the impact factor of each FAME composition in terms of the method from AOCS."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 XRD The method of X-ray diffraction was performed to estimate the structure of prepared Ni-La-B catalyst. The obtained XRD pattern of Ni–La–B catalyst is displayed in Fig. 1 . It could be found from Fig. 1 that a single broad peak at around 2θ value of 45° was observed, which was attributed to the amorphous structure of Ni–B alloy, as reported in the literature by Jing Fang et al. [28]. With the molar ratio of La:Ni=1:40, a similar catalyst of Ni–La–B has been synthesized by Bai et al., which was in the form of amorphous alloy [29]. It should be noted that the XRD pattern for our prepared Ni–La–B catalyst, which was synthesized at La/Ni molar ratio of 1:20, showed a similar single broad peak compared with the reported XRD pattern of the amorphous Ni–La–B alloy from Bai [29]. Therefore, in the present work, the prepared Ni–La–B catalyst was in the form of an amorphous structure. 3.1.2 SEM and eds The morphology and structure of Ni–La–B catalyst were investigated through SEM. Fig. 2 (a) presents the SEM image of the Ni–La–B catalyst. It was clear that catalyst particles showed uniform dispersion with the structure of irregular spheres. To further determine the existence of the elements including Ni, La and B in the Ni–La–B catalyst, the elemental distribution on the surface Ni–La–B catalyst was characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The EDS spectrum is shown in Fig. 2(b), and the obtained elemental mapping images of the Ni–La–B catalyst are shown in Fig. 2(c)∼2(e). It could be seen that the elements of Ni, La and B were dispersed uniformly on the surface of Ni–La–B catalyst. Moreover, the elemental composition and the corresponding weight percentage of the Ni–La–B catalyst have been listed in Table 2 . It was found that the weight percentages of Ni, La, B and O were 73.85 wt%, 9.99 wt%, 8.77 wt% and 7.38 wt%, respectively. The result manifested that the catalyst of Ni–La–B, containing the elements of Ni, La and B, has been synthesized. 3.1.3 TEM For further study the morphology and structure, the prepared Ni–La–B catalyst was investigated by using transmission electron microscopy. The TEM images of Ni–La–B catalyst are presented in Fig. 3 (a) and 3(b). It could be found that the particles of Ni–La–B catalyst dispersed uniformly and exhibited irregular sphericity, and the particle size of Ni–La–B particle was observed in the range of approximately 10 to 100 nm. The particle size distribution of Ni–La–B catalyst is presented in Fig. 3(c). According to the statistics of particle size, the average particle size was about 35 nm. As reported by Pei et al. [30], amorphous alloy observed from TEM image usually displayed spherical contour and irregularly shaped aggregates of spherical particles. Hence, as shown in Fig. 3, the results of TEM also indicated that the prepared Ni–La–B catalyst was an amorphous alloy, which was in agreement with the aforementioned result of XRD (Fig. 1)."
9,CTH of FAMEs under ultrasound,"3.2 CTH of FAMEs under ultrasound 3.2.1 Effect of reaction temperature on CTH of FAMEs The effect of reaction temperature plays a significant role in the chemical reaction. The CTH of FAMEs was explored by varying the reaction temperature over the range of 35–75 °C to investigate the effect of reaction temperature on the CTH of FAMEs. The reaction conditions were as follows: agitation speed 500 rpm, reaction time 120 min, water quantity 100 g, and sodium borohydride amount 1.14 g. The results are presented in Fig. 4 (a) and 4(b). As shown in Fig. 4(a), with the reaction temperature increase from 35 to 75 °C, the C18:2 content in FAMEs reduced gradually from the initial content of 78.32 wt% in raw FAMEs. Correspondingly, the CR C182 increased obviously with the reaction temperature, and reached the maximum value (83.77%) at the highest temperature of 75 °C (as presented in Fig. 4(b)). These results manifested that raising reaction temperature was beneficial to promote the conversion of polyunsaturated FAMEs and accelerate the course of reaction. Under the condition of ultrasonic, with the increase of reaction temperature, a large number of active hydrogen atoms cloud be easily generated on the surface of catalyst through the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride. Besides the ultrasound effect, the generated active hydrogen atoms further inhibited the agglomeration of catalyst particles to some extent [31]. Hence, in the ultrasonic-assisted process, a high dispersion of catalyst particles could be obtained in the reaction system. Furthermore, the increased reaction temperature could activate the CTH reactants which speeded up the CTH rate. In addition, the C18:0 content reached 28.69 wt% at the reaction temperature of 75 °C, compared to the initial value (0.83 wt%) of the raw FAMEs. It implied that the deep hydrogenation of C18:1 to C18:0 easily occurred with the increase of reaction temperature. Even through the reaction temperature had a relatively significant effect on the hydrogenation of polyunsaturated FAMEs and the generation of C18:0, it was different for the formation of cis-trans isomers during the ultrasonic-assisted reaction. As shown in Fig. 4(a), with the increase of reaction temperature from 35 to 75 °C, the content of c-C18:1 slightly reduced, and correspondingly, the content of t-C18:1 showed a slight increase. The above results indicated that in the process of CTH, the temperature did not have a significant influence on the formation of cis-trans isomers [12]. Hence, under the condition of maintaining the high CR C182, to gain a hydrogenated product with relatively low contents of t-C18:1 and C18:0, and meanwhile, to save producing energy, 35 °C was chosen as the appropriate reaction temperature for CTH in the next experiments. The CR C182 at 35 °C was 78.75%. 3.2.2 Effect of agitation speed on CTH of FAMEs The ultrasound-assisted CTH of FAMEs was a heterogeneous reaction due to the fact that there were solid catalyst of Ni–La–B and two immiscible liquids, i.e., FAMEs and hydrogen donor solutions, in the reaction system. Therefore, the degree of contact between the reactants and Ni–La–B catalyst had an impact on the progress of CTH reaction. In the presence of ultrasound, the turbulence effect generated in the reaction solution of CTH could promote the formation of extremely fine droplets, which was beneficial to enhance the degree of contact between the immiscible reactants and Ni–La–B catalyst. [7]. However, the bulk flow and circulation in the solution could not be achieved via the use of ultrasound. Agitation played a significant part in forming coarse emulsion by breaking the interface between the two liquid phases during the initial stage of the CTH reaction [13]. Thus, the speed of agitation would make an important difference for the heterogeneous CTH reaction. To study the effect of agitation speed, the ultrasound-assisted CTH reactions were carried out over a range of agitation speed from 200 to 600 rpm. The otherwise conditions of CTH were remained unchanged as follows: reaction temperature 35 °C, reaction time 120 min, water quantity 100 g, pH value of reaction solution 7, Ni–La–B catalyst dosage 10 wt%, and NaBH4 amount 1.14 g. The results as shown in Fig. 5 (a) and 5(b) indicated that the agitation speed had a positive effect on the process of ultrasound-assisted CTH. When the agitation speed was 200 rpm, the content of C18:2 composition in hydrogenation FAMEs decreased to 20.93 wt%, and the corresponding CR C182 reached 73.23%. With the increase of agitation speed from 200 to 500 rpm, the CR C182 of hydrogenated products rose gradually from 73.23% to 78.66%. A further increase in the speed of agitation to 600 rpm presented an inappreciable variation in the C18:2 content, and the corresponding CR C182 of 78.80% was almost the same as at 500 rpm. This result indicated that when the agitation speed reached 500 rpm, the reaction system had been mixed uniformly and the resistance of mass transfer between two immiscible reactants and Ni–La–B catalyst had been eliminated. These results mentioned above might be due to the fact that even though external diffusion played a weak effect on the CTH of FAMEs, the catalyst could not be dispersed uniformly in the reaction solution to contact fully with the reactants at the slow speed of agitation. When the agitation speed increased to a certain point, the catalyst was mixed completely and well distributed in the reaction system, which improved the utilization of the catalyst and promoted the progress of hydrogenation. Additionally, it was also observed that the C18:0 content of hydrogenated FAMEs obtained at the agitation speed of 600 rpm was higher than that at speed of 500 rpm. The high content of C18:0, which has the high melting point of 39 °C, was adverse to the improvement of the cold flow property of hydrogenated FAMEs. Besides, considering that the high speed of agitation beyond 500 rpm had little impact on the process of CTH reaction except for increasing energy consumption, 500 rpm was chosen as the best appropriate speed of agitation for the further experiments. 3.2.3 Effect of reaction time on CTH of FAMEs To determine the effect of reaction time on the progress of ultrasound-assisted CTH of FAMEs, the hydrogenation reactions were conducted at different reaction time ranging from 24 to 144 min. The other reaction conditions of CTH were maintained constant as follows: reaction temperature of 35 °C, agitation speed 500 rpm, water quantity of 100 g, pH value of reaction solution of 7, catalyst dosage of 10 wt% and NaBH4 amount of 1.14 g. Fig. 6 (a) and 6(b) illustrates the obtained results. As shown in Fig. 6(a), a continuous decrease in the C18:2 content of hydrogenated FAMEs was found as the reaction time increased from 24 to 144 min. The C18:2 content reduced rapidly over the range of reaction time from 24 to 96 min and then decreased slightly with the further increase of reaction time to 144 min. Correspondingly, the CR C182 of hydrogenated FAMEs presented a steady increase as shown in Fig. 6(b). When the reaction time was 144 min, the C18:2 content declined to the lowest value of 16.45 wt% from the initial content of 78.32 wt.%, and the CR C182 of the product reached 79%. This was mainly due to the accumulative effect with time under the actions of cavitation and intense turbulence from ultrasound, which helped the intraparticle diffusion in reaction system [13]. Therefore, with the ultrasound, the mass transfer was intensified for CTH of FAMEs. The hydrogenation conversion ratio of C18:2 was promoted in short time. However, it could be observed that the C18:0 content of 22.54 wt% at the reaction time of 144 min was higher than that of 13.84 wt% which was obtained at 120 min. This result indicated that the deep hydrogenation might occur after a long reaction time. As there was a negligible difference between the CR C182 of hydrogenated products for the cases of reaction time of 120 min and 140 min. Hence, 120 min was considered as the optimum reaction time. 3.2.4 Effect of pH of reaction solution on CTH of FAMEs In the reaction system of ultrasound-assisted CTH, sodium borohydride was used as the hydrogen donor to donate hydrogen atoms for the hydrogenation of FAMEs. However, the NaBH4 could be hydrolyzed easily into hydrogen gas in an acidic solution whereas it was stable relatively in an alkaline solution [32]. Thus, the pH value of reaction solution had a significant influence on the hydrolysis of NaBH4 and hence on the hydrogen-donating activity of NaBH4 for the CTH of FAMEs. To understand the effect of pH value of reaction solution, the solution with different pH values of 7, 8, 10, 12 and 14, which was regulated by adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH), was used to carry out the ultrasound-assisted CTH with the other reaction parameters keeping constant as follows: reaction temperature 35 °C, reaction time 120 min, agitation speed 500 rpm, water quantity 100 g, Ni–La–B catalyst dosage 10 wt% and NaBH4 amount 1.14 g. The experimental results are displayed in Fig. 7 (a) and 7(b). It was found that as the pH value of reaction solution increased from 7 to 14, the CR C182 increased firstly and then reduced. When the pure water with the pH value of 7 was used in the CTH reaction, the CR C182 of hydrogenated FAMEs was 78.66%. As the pH value of reaction solution further increased to 10, the CR C182 enhanced gradually and reached the maximum value of 85.74%. This result could be attributed to the fact that when the pH value of reaction solution increased gradually, the alkalinity of solution increased concurrently, leading to an inhibition effect for the hydrolysis of NaBH4. Therefore, less hydrogen gas was generated from the hydrolysis process, and more NaBH4 was involved in the CTH reaction by donating the hydrogen atoms directly, enhancing the hydrogenation conversion ratio of C18:2. However, it was observed that the CR C182 dropped distinctly to 35.39% when the pH value of reaction solution further increased to 14 from 10. This result implied that the course of CTH reaction might be restrained in the alkaline solution at the high pH value. Thereby, the solution with an appropriate pH value was required in the CTH reaction. In addition, according to the result about the composition of C18 FAME (Fig. 7(a)), the C18:0 content in the hydrogenated FAMEs rose gradually with the increase of pH value from 7 to 10, which was a negative influence on the cold flow property of the hydrogenated product. Considering the results mentioned above, the pure water with the pH value of ca. 7 was chosen as the optimum reaction solution in the further CTH reactions. 3.2.5 Effect of catalyst dosage on CTH of FAMEs For the hydrogenation of FAMEs, the catalyst of Ni–La–B played a crucial role in the ultrasound-assisted CTH reaction. To investigate the effect of Ni–La–B catalyst dosage on the process of ultrasound-assisted CTH, a series of experiments at different catalyst dosages ranging from 6 to 14 wt% have been implemented at the following conditions: reaction temperature 35 °C, reaction time 120 min, water quantity 100 g and NaBH4 amount 1.14 g. As shown in Fig. 8 (a) and 8(b), a positive effect of Ni–La–B catalyst dosage on the hydrogenation of FAMEs was observed. It could be found from Fig. 8(a) that after hydrogenation, the content of C18:2 during the hydrogenation of FAMEs reduced steadily with the increase of the Ni–La–B catalyst dosage, and the corresponding CR C182 enhanced gradually. As the catalyst dosage used for the CTH reaction was added from 6 to 12 wt%, the content of C18:2 reduced obviously from 25.66 to 13.35 wt%. However, a negligible decrease in the content of C18:2 to 12.02 wt% was observed when the catalyst dosage was further added to 14 wt%. And the CR C182 presented in Fig. 8(b) reached the maximum value of 84.65% at the catalyst dosage of 14 wt%. These results manifested that the augment of catalyst loading in the CTH reaction was beneficial to accelerate the CTH. With the growth in the dosage of Ni–La–B catalyst, the number of active sites supplied by nickel in the catalyst obviously increased. And, with the ultrasound, the aggregation of catalyst particles in the reaction system could be effectively reduced by the cavitation of ultrasound. Hence the content of C18:2 involved in the hydrogenation reaction increased. Nevertheless, it was notable that the C18:0 content increased distinctly when the catalyst dosage was added over 10 wt%. As the catalyst dosage increased from 12 to 14 wt%, it could be seen that the content of C18:1 composition declined whereas the content of C18:0 increased conspicuously. This result indicated that when the excess catalyst was involved in the CTH reaction, the deep hydrogenation of C18:1 to C18:0 occurred easily. It might be due to that the composition of C18:1 transformed from the C18:2 was adsorbed again by the active sites of unreacted catalyst, and the C18:1 was further hydrogenated and transformed into the C18:0. Considering that the high content of C18:0 was harmful to the upgrading of raw FAMEs, the catalyst dosage of 10 wt% was determined as the optimum for the ultrasound-assisted CTH reaction. 3.2.6 Effect of sodium borohydride amount on CTH of FAMEs Sodium borohydride was a nontoxic and promising hydrogen storage material with a high theoretical hydrogen capacity of 10.8 wt% [33]. Therefore, it was used as a hydrogen donor to provide adequate hydrogen for the ultrasound-assisted CTH reaction. As mentioned in Section 3.2.4, sodium borohydride in an aqueous solution with the optimum pH value of 7 might be hydrolyzed to hydrogen gas, which had an adverse impact on the donation of hydrogen for the CTH reaction. Hence, the amount of sodium borohydride played a crucial part in the hydrogenation of raw FAMEs and was necessary to be studied. To establish the best appropriate amount of sodium borohydride, different NaBH4 amounts of 0.38, 0.76, 1.14, 1.51 and 1.89 g were used in the CTH reaction with temperature of 35 °C for 120 min, 500 rpm as the agitation speed, 100 g of water quantity and 10 wt% of Ni–La–B catalyst dosage. The obtained results of experiments are given in Fig. 9 (a) and 9(b). It could be found that the amount of sodium borohydride had an evident effect on the ultrasound-assisted CTH reaction. As the sodium borohydride amount increased from 0.38 to 1.89 g, the C18:2 contents declined obviously over the range of 0.38 to 1.51 g and then decreased slightly from 1.51 to 1.89 g. Thus, the minimum content of C18:2 (9.47 wt%) was obtained at the NaBH4 amount of 1.89 g, and the corresponding CR C182 depicted in Fig. 9(b) reached the maximum value of 87.91%. However, it was also observed that when the sodium borohydride amount increased from 1.14 to 1.89 g, there was a small decrease in the C18:2 content by 7.24 wt% but a significant increase in the C18:0 content by 18.30 wt%. These results demonstrated that the increase of sodium borohydride amount was contributed to the proceeding of CTH reaction, whereas the excess sodium borohydride used for the CTH might lead to deep hydrogenation. The rise of CR C182 of the CTH reaction could be ascribed to the fact that with the increase of sodium borohydride amount, more hydrogen atoms supplied by sodium borohydride could be used for the hydrogenation of more C18:2 FAME. In conclusion, considering the CR C182 and the content of C18 composition in the hydrogenated product, the optimum amount of sodium borohydride for the ultrasound-assisted CTH was 1.14 g, and the corresponding CR C182 of hydrogenation FAMEs was 78.66%."
10,Analysis of hydrogenated FAMEs,"3.3 Analysis of hydrogenated FAMEs According to the experiment results previously discussed in this work, the hydrogenated FAMEs with high CR C182 of 78.66% was obtained under the optimum ultrasound-assisted CTH conditions as follows: ultrasonic power 120 W, ultrasonic frequency 40 kHz, reaction temperature 35 °C, reaction time 120 min, Ni–La–B catalyst dosage 10 wt%, sodium borohydride amount 1.14 g and water quantity 100 g (pH value =7). Table 3 displays the composition and content of FAMEs hydrogenated under the optimum process conditions of ultrasound-assisted CTH. As shown in Table 3, after hydrogenation, the content of C18:2 FAME declined obviously from the initial content of 78.32 wt% in raw FAMEs to 16.71 wt%, which decreased by about 61.61 wt%. In the meanwhile, the content of C18:1 composition had a significant increase by 48.14 wt%, and the contents of c-C18:1 and t-C18:1 increased to 33.96 wt% and 33.10 wt%, respectively. For the saturated composition of hydrogenated product, the C18:0 content increased to 13.84 wt%. From the variation in the content of FAMEs composition before and after hydrogenation, it was clear that the polyunsaturated C18:2 was hydrogenated effectively into the monounsaturated C18:1 under the ultrasound-assisted CTH. Furthermore, as shown in Table 3, from the initial value of 151.92 in the raw FAMEs, the iodine value declined distinctly to 86.61 after the hydrogenation. This result implied that the high unsaturation degree of raw FAMEs had achieved an obvious reduction after the ultrasound-assisted CTH reaction. Generally speaking, the FAMEs with low content of polyunsaturated composition, which must have the low value of IV, always exhibit good oxidation stability [6]. Therefore, the CTH of FAMEs with the assistance of ultrasound was favorable to improving the oxidation stability of raw FAMEs through effectively reducing the C18:2 content in raw FAMEs. To sum up, the FAMEs with high content of polyunsaturated composition could be effectively hydrogenated by the ultrasound-assisted CTH process."
11,Catalyst recyclability,"3.4 Catalyst recyclability Generally speaking, the catalyst used in the CTH reaction was a depletion agent which was hard to be completely recycled. Therefore, the investigation of catalyst reusability was essential for the CTH reaction. The test of catalyst recyclability was carried out under the following conditions: reaction temperature 35 °C, reaction time 120 min, agitation speed 500 rpm, water quantity 100 g, pH value of reaction solution 7, Ni–La–B catalyst dosage10 wt% and NaBH4 amount 1.14 g. After each cycle of test, the used Ni-La-B catalyst was collected and washed with ethanol to remove the residual organic compounds on the catalyst. The experiment result of catalyst reusability is depicted in Fig. 10 . It could be found from Fig. 10 that the CR C182 of FAMEs was able to reach 74.50% even after the Ni–La–B catalyst was reused 5 times. This result indicated that the catalytic activity of the Ni–La–B catalyst remained its catalytic activity without significant loss after five recycling experiments. Therefore, the Ni–La–B catalyst exhibited good reusability for the ultrasound-assisted CTH of FAMEs."
12,Comparison of ultrasound-assisted approach with conventional and ultrasound approaches,"3.5 Comparison of ultrasound-assisted approach with conventional and ultrasound approaches Under the operating conditions of reaction temperature 35 °C, catalyst dosage 10 wt%, NaBH4 amount 1.14 g and water quantity 100 g, the comparison of ultrasound-assisted approach with conventional and ultrasound approaches has been carried out. As shown in Fig. 11 , under the ultrasound approach, which was in the presence of ultrasound without mechanical agitation, the CR C182 of hydrogenated FAMEs was only 63.40% when the reaction time was 120 min. Correspondingly, the iodine value decreased to 96.23 from the initial value of 151.92 of raw FAMEs. Compared with the CR C182 obtained in the ultrasound approach, it could be found that, especially in the range of reaction time > 48 min, the CR C182 obtained by the ultrasound-assisted approach increased obviously. Moreover, for the conventional approach only in the presence of mechanical agitation without the assistance of ultrasound, even though the CTH reaction proceeded continuously and steadily for 120 min, the maximum CR C182 obtained by this approach at the longest time of 120 min was only 44.16%. However, at the same reaction time of 120 min, the CR C182 of hydrogenated FAMEs by the ultrasound-assisted CTH reached a high value of 78.66%. Those results indicated that the use of ultrasound in the CTH of FAMEs presented a significant effect of process intensification on the hydrogenation conversion of FAMEs. Furthermore, for the CTH reaction of the conventional approach, the iodine value of hydrogenated FAMEs obtained at 120 min was only reduced to 118.44 from 151.92, which was the initial iodine value of raw FAMEs. However, in the case of the ultrasound-assisted approach, a pronounced reduction in the iodine value of hydrogenated FAMEs was observed. From the initial iodine value of 151.92, the iodine value of hydrogenated FAMEs declined to 86.61 at the same hydrogenation time of 120 min. It was also found that for the ultrasound-assisted approach, the iodine value of hydrogenated FAMEs quickly declined to 116.92 even at the reaction time of 24 min, which was less than the final iodine value (118.44) of the hydrogenated product obtained at 120 min by the conventional approach. The result indicated that the degree of unsaturation of hydrogenated FAMEs had a larger reduction by the ultrasound-assisted approach with the assistance of ultrasound than by the conventional approach. That is, in the case of achieving the same reduction of iodine value during the CTH of FAMEs, ultrasound-assisted CTH required a significantly less reaction time compared to the CTH under conventional approach. The result demonstrated that the use of ultrasound in the CTH reaction could shorten the reaction time and accelerate the reaction progress. In summary, ultrasound has presented a significant intensification effect on the CTH of FAMEs, and a high hydrogenation conversion ratio of FAMEs could be easily realized under the mild CTH conditions with ultrasound. In addition, to understand the main quality property of hydrogenation products obtained by three different approaches, more detailed quality parameters of FAMEs were predicted by Biodiesel Analyzer software (available on “http://www.brteam.ir/biodieselanalyzer”). Cetane number (CN) is one of the main factors affecting the ignition quality of FAMEs. As shown in Table 4 , for three different approaches of ultrasound-assisted approach, ultrasound and conventional approach, the CN values of hydrogenated FAMEs were 53.38, 50.96 and 45.81, respectively. Compared with the CN values of hydrogenated products by ultrasound and conventional approaches (50.96 and 45.81, respectively), the CN value of hydrogenated FAMEs by ultrasound-assisted approach was higher (53.38). The results manifested that under the same reaction conditions, the hydrogenated FAMEs via the ultrasound-assisted approach had good ignition properties and engine performance. Cold filter plugging point (CFPP) is a main factor reflecting the cold flow property of fatty acid methyl ester. Compared with the hydrogenated product by ultrasound approach, the hydrogenated FAMEs by ultrasound-assisted approach had a lower value of CFPP. As shown in Fig. 11 and Table 4, even with the higher conversion ratio of C18:2 composition, the hydrogenated product by ultrasound-assisted approach had the obvious characteristics of lower content of C18:0 and higher content of C18:1 in the imposition of C18 components than the hydrogenated product by ultrasound approach. In comparison with the ultrasound process without mechanical agitation, the mechanical agitation helped to diffuse the hydrogenated FAMEs quickly into the liquid phase, and to a certain extent, the deep hydrogenation could be avoided. Hence, the hydrogenated FAMEs by ultrasound-assisted approach had a relatively low value of CFPP compared to that by ultrasound approach. Furthermore, the oxidation stability of hydrogenated FAMEs is listed in Table 4. The OS value of the hydrogenated FAMEs by ultrasound-assisted approach was the highest (9.65 h) among the hydrogenated products by three different approaches. In summary, the ultrasound-assisted approach truly had the advantage of gaining the hydrogenated FAMEs with good performance. A simple energy analysis was employed to evaluate the energy consumption for CTH of FAMEs with the assistance of ultrasound. The total energy (E T) could be evaluated according to Eq. (3) [34]: (3) E T = ( P u × T + P c × T ) / ( m × C R 182 ) where P u and P c are the power of ultrasound-assisted and conventional approach, respectively; T is reaction time; m is the content of C18:2 in the raw material FAMEs; CR 182 represents the conversion ratio of C18:2. Based on the optimum CTH conditions, the E T of ultrasound-assisted approach, ultrasound approach and conventional approach was 868.182 × 103 KJ/kg, 455.716 × 103 KJ/kg, 1486.971 × 103 KJ/kg, respectively. The result indicated that the conventional approach had a higher energy consumption than the ultrasound-assisted approach and the ultrasound approach. The application of ultrasound in the catalytic transfer hydrogen of FAMEs was obviously energy-efficient [34]. Though the ultrasound approach had the lower energy consumption than the ultrasound-assisted approach, in view of the superiority of hydrogenated FAMEs and the high conversion ratio of C18:2 composition by ultrasound-assisted approach, the ultrasound-assisted approach possessed some relative advantages in CTH of FAMEs."
13,Analysis of intensification effect on CTH reaction,"3.6 Analysis of intensification effect on CTH reaction It has been widely reported the intensification effect of ultrasound on the process of reaction Under the presence of ultrasound, there were some physical effects such as cavitation and intense turbulence in the ultrasound-assisted reaction system. For the heterogeneous reaction system of CTH, the effect of cavitation was favorable to the dispersion of catalyst and the elimination of mass transfer resistances between the catalyst and the reactants, and hence promoting the process of reaction. Also, the local hot spots formed from the cavitation could cause the intense local heating, enhancing the reaction rate [13]. Furthermore, the turbulence generated in the presence of ultrasound could also accelerate the mass transfer rate between the reactants and the catalyst surface, favoring the fast progress of reaction [20]. Consequently, the cavitation and turbulence were in favor of the hydrogenation of FAMEs, and thereby high conversion ratio of C18:2 has been obtained by the ultrasound-assisted CTH. However, as found in Sections 3.2.2 and 3.5, the intensification effect from ultrasound on the CTH of FAMEs existed clearly in the reaction system even eliminating the mass transfer resistances between two immiscible reactants and Ni–La–B catalyst. Hence, besides the mass transfer in the reaction system, there should be some effects originated from Ni–La–B catalyst under the action of ultrasound, which could play a great influence on the special systems of oil reactants. To understand the intensification effect from Ni–La–B catalyst under ultrasound, the different catalysts, including fresh catalyst and used catalysts in Section 3.4, were analyzed by a series of characterizations. The used Ni–La–B catalyst in the CTH process of conventional approach was denoted as Ni–La–BCA, and the used Ni–La–B catalyst in the process of unconventional heatingtrasound-assisted CTH was labeled as Ni–La–BUA. The FT-IR spectra of the catalysts of fresh Ni–La–B, Ni–La–BCA and Ni–La–BUA are illustrated respectively in Fig. 12(a) . As shown in Fig. 12(a), the peaks at 2915 cm−1, 2853 cm−1 and 717 cm−1 were found in the FT-IR spectra of used catalysts (Ni–La–BCA and Ni–La–BUA); however, the corresponding peaks were not observed in the FT-IR spectra of fresh Ni–La–B catalyst. The peaks at 2915 cm−1 and 2853 cm−1 were assigned to CH2 asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes, respectively, and the weak band at around 717 cm−1 was attributed to the CH2 rocking modes (γ(CH2)) [35]. These results revealed that there might be carbonaceous organic material both on the catalysts of Ni–La–BCA and Ni–La–BUA. In addition, different from Ni–La–BUA, an obvious and intensive band at around 1742 cm−1 was observed in the catalyst of Ni–La–BCA, which belonged to the stretching vibration of CO from ester [36]. Whether during the processes of ultrasound-assisted CTH or conventional CTH, for the heterogeneous reaction, the reactants of FAMEs would be firstly adsorbed on the catalyst and then began the hydrogenation on the catalyst surface. The FT-IR result demonstrated that there were truly the adsorbed ester compounds on the surface of the used catalyst. However, considering the differences of FT-IR spectra between Ni–La–BCA and Ni–La–BUA, it could be safely concluded that under the action of ultrasound, the adsorbed FAMEs might be easily detached from the catalyst surface when the reaction was finished during the process of CTH. The thermogravimetric analysis measurements of catalyst were implemented to find out the deposition amount of FAMEs on the surface of Ni–La–B catalyst. The results have been given in Fig. 12(b) . In the obtained TGA curves of two used catalysts of Ni–La–BCA and Ni–La–BUA, there were obvious weight losses in the range of the temperature from 180 to 370 °C, which was not observed in the TGA curve of fresh Ni-La-B catalyst. The result could be owing to the combustion and decomposition of the organic matter on the surfaces of Ni–La–BCA and Ni–La–BUA catalysts. When the temperature increased over 400 °C, the TGA curves of fresh Ni–La–B catalyst, Ni–La–BCA catalyst and Ni–La–BUA catalyst ascended gradually with the same trend, indicating the increase of catalyst weight. The result might be due to the formation of the oxides in the Ni-based catalysts. In addition, comparing the weight losses between the catalysts of Ni–La–BCA and Ni–La–BUA as the temperature increased from 180 to 370 °C, a significant weight loss of 22.0% was observed for the Ni–La–BCA catalyst. As for the Ni–La–BUA, there was a slight weight loss of 9.3%. This result implied that after the CTH reaction without the ultrasound, the surface of the used catalyst of Ni–La–BCA was covered with more organic matter of FAMEs. It might be due to the fact that in the presence of ultrasound, the turbulence formed in the reaction system was beneficial to the clean surface of Ni–La–B catalyst [20]. The morphological features of the Ni–La–B catalysts via SEM characterization are shown in Fig. 12(c) . As shown in Fig. 12(c), the catalyst particles of fresh Ni–La–B were uniform and dispersive. For the Ni–La–BCA catalyst, the irregular aggregated particles and rough surface of the catalyst are observed, which was due to the fact that some FAMEs have been adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Under conventional approach, the adsorbed FAMEs could not be detached from the catalyst surface after the reaction during the process of CTH. The adsorbed FAMEs with the viscosity characteristics made the catalyst particles easily be aggregated, which was especially for catalyst particles with small size. However, it was found that the Ni–La–BUA catalyst showed more uniform in the catalyst particles and smoother surface compared with the catalyst of Ni–La–BCA. The difference was attributed to the cavitation effects generated from ultrasound, which could detach the adsorbed FAMEs and inhibit the agglomeration of Ni-La-BUA catalyst during the process of ultrasound-assisted CTH [20]. Moreover, as found in the FT-IR characterization, CO stretch belonging to the ester functional group was not observed in the Ni–La–BUA catalyst. When the FAMEs molecules had been partially hydrogenated, the timely desorption of hydrogenated FAMEs from the surface of catalyst was crucial to the smooth hydrogenation of unhydrogenated FAMEs. The above phenomenon belonged to the self-purification function of ultrasound for the catalyst. With the self-purification function of ultrasound, new catalytic sites on the surface of catalyst would be exposed to the unreacted reactants, which was in favor of keeping the high catalytic activity of catalyst and thus promoting the progress of CTH reaction. Based on the series of characterizations of catalysts, it was found that the use of ultrasound in the CTH of FAMEs was helpful to maintain the favorable surface morphology of Ni–La–B catalyst. In view of the significant intensification effect from ultrasound on the CTH of FAMEs which was compared with the process without ultrasound, it was safely concluded that the self-purification function of ultrasound played a very important positive effect on the intensification of catalytic transfer hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl esters."
14,Conclusions,"Under the intensification of ultrasound, the effective hydrogenation of FAMEs has been realized successfully at mild conditions through CTH reaction using Ni–La–B as catalyst, sodium borohydride as hydrogen donor, and water as solvent. The reaction parameters of CTH have been investigated, and the optimum CTH conditions were established as follows: reaction temperature 35 °C, reaction time 120 min, agitation speed 500 rpm, water quantity 100 g, pH value of reaction solution 7, Ni–La–B catalyst dosage 10 wt.% and NaBH4 amount 1.14 g. Under the optimum conditions, the high hydrogenation conversion ratio of 78.66% has been achieved. It was found that ultrasound presented a significant intensification effect on the CTH of FAMEs, and a high hydrogenation conversion ratio of polyunsaturated FAMEs was easily realized with ultrasound even at mild CTH conditions. The self-purification function of ultrasound played a very important positive effect on the intensification of catalytic transfer hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl esters. In conclusion, ultrasound-assisted CTH was an effective process intensification method for the hydrogenation of FAMEs to achieve a high hydrogenation conversion ratio at mild conditions."
