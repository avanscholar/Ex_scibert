0,Introduction,"Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA), as a water-soluble polymer, has attracted an intensive attention recently because of its easy processability, biocompatibility, biodegradability and non-toxicity [1,2]. In this case, it has been widely applied in the field of textile, membrane manufacturing, biomedicine, packaging industry, construction materials and many others [3]. However, the poor mechanical property and high flammability have limited its use in many fields [4,5]. Graphene, a two-dimensional carbon material with extraordinary mechanical properties (tensile modulus of ~1 TPa, failure strength of 121 GPa), large surface area (2600 m2/g), superior thermal and electrical properties [6], has received an intense attention for its potential application in composite materials [7,8]. Therefore, some researchers have used graphene derivatives as PVA-composite reinforcement to improve the mechanical performance and flame retardancy of PVA [9,10]. Jiang et al. [10] has prepared functionalized graphene oxide-reinforced poly(vinyl alcohol) composites by the sol-gel method, improving the fire resistance, thermal stability and mechanical properties of PVA. However, the realization of these applications on the commercialization is difficult, because mass production of graphene nanosheets remains a huge challenge [11]. Over the past decade, various strategies such as micro-mechanical exfoliation, liquid-phase exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and epitaxial growth have been exploited to fabricate graphene nanosheets from original graphite. Nevertheless, these methodologies are facing the problem of the low yield and/or high cost which restrict their scalable application [12]. In contrast, chemical oxidation-reduction of graphite provides an appealing approach for the large-scale production of graphene and its functionalized derivatives due to excellent processability, high conversion efficiency and potential scalability [13]. Unfortunately, this method needs numerous hazardous chemicals, resulting in the production of various hazardous gases and plenty of waste water containing heavy metal ions [14]. Most recently, electrochemical exfoliation affords an alternative route for producing graphene on an industrial scale because it is a simple and fast method to synthesize graphene nanosheets, and it is free from strong chemical oxidants. More importantly, the quantity and quality of manufactured graphene nanosheets can be controlled via changing the exfoliation conditions [15]. Generally, the electrochemical exfoliation reaction primarily is performed in ionic liquids [16] or aqueous media [17]. In the case of ionic liquids, only a low yield of graphene is exfoliated. In comparison, exfoliation in aqueous media is the most common method, which is advantageous from the standpoint of environmental protection and practical production [18]. Meanwhile, high yield graphene can be fabricated in aqueous media. Parvez et al. [11] reported a simple and fast approach to manufacture graphene nanosheets, using a series of inorganic salt (Na2SO4, K2SO4, (NH4)2SO4, etc.) aqueous solutions as electrolyte to electrochemical exfoliate graphene. Thin-layer graphene nanosheets were produced at a high yield with large lateral size. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that these graphene nanosheets are difficult to efficiently enhance the properties of water-soluble polymer. This is because the surface of graphene nanosheets has very few oxygen-containing functional groups, leading to poor dispersion in water-soluble matrix and weak interfacial interaction between graphene nanosheets and matrix [19,20]. The surface functionalization of graphene nanosheets is a well-known method to improve the poor dispersion of graphene and weak interfacial interaction between graphene nanosheets and polymers [21–23]. Herein, a commercially-available surfactant DNS86 was chosen to simultaneously exfoliate and functionalize graphene using a green and low-cost electrochemical approach. We demonstrated that the oxidation of free radicals and intercalation of DNS86 anions would lead to exfoliation of graphite. Meanwhile, DNS86 anions could be absorbed onto graphene surface, forming water-dispersible graphene. Subsequently, the water-dispersible graphene nanosheets were incorporated into PVA matrix, which were anticipated to improve the mechanical and flame-retardant properties of PVA."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Graphite flake (dimensions, 80 × 20 × 0.5 mm3, purity ≥ 99%) was obtained from Beijing Jinglong Carbon Technology Co., Ltd. (China). Allyloxy nonyl alcohol polyoxyethylene (10) ether ammonium sulfate (DNS86) (Fig. 1 ) was supplied by Foshan Kodi Industries Co., Ltd. (China). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA-1799, polymerization degree 1700, deacetylation degree 98–99%) was purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were utilized as received without further purification. Deionized water was applied in all the experiments."
3,Preparation of water-dispersible graphene,"2.2 Preparation of water-dispersible graphene The water-dispersible graphene nanosheets were prepared from graphite flakes by electrochemical method. Graphite flake, platinum foil, and 150 ml of 0.025 mol/L DNS86 aqueous solution were used as the anode, cathode, and electrolyte, respectively. The two electrodes were placed parallelly at a distance of 1.0 cm and a direct voltage (10 V) was performed for 6 h. The exfoliated products were obtained through a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane with a pore diameter of 0.45 μm and repeatedly washed with deionized water. Subsequently, the exfoliated products were dispersed with assistance of mechanical stir at 600 r/min and water bath sonication (500 W) for 1 h and then centrifugation at 2000 r/min for 10 min, the water-dispersible graphene nanosheets were obtained by collecting the supernatant liquid. The graphene powder was gotten through a high rate centrifugation of 16,000 r/min for 40min and then dried under ambient conditions. This water-dispersible graphene nanosheets were named as DGNS."
4,Preparation of PVA/DGNS composite films,"2.3 Preparation of PVA/DGNS composite films The PVA/DGNS composite film containing 1.0 wt% DGNS was prepared as followed: 50 mg of DGNS was dispersed in 15 ml of deionized water by mechanical stir and treated with water bath sonication (500 W) for 2 h to get a stably water-dispersible graphene suspension. 5 g of PVA was dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water at 90 °C for 3 h with magnetic agitation, and subsequently the solution was cooled to room temperature. The DGNS suspension was gradually dripped into the above PVA solution and the mixture was stirred for 12 h in the water bath sonication (500 W). Finally, the homogeneous PVA/DGNS solution was slowly pour into polytetrafluoroethylene plate (150 mm × 150 mm × 3 mm) and dried at room temperature for four days to form flat film. The flat film was peeled off from the polytetrafluoroethylene plate and further heated at 80 °C until the weight was equilibrated. A series of PVA/DGNS composites films were fabricated using the same method. The composite films containing 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 2.0 wt% graphene nanosheets were designated as PVA/DGNS-0.1, PVA/DGNS-0.3, PVA/DGNS-1.0 and PVA/DGNS-2.0, respectively. The thickness of the resulting films was controlled to be about 0.2 mm."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The micro-structural morphology of graphene nanosheets and the cross-sections of PVA composite films were observed using a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscopy (Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co., Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The thickness and size of graphene nanosheets were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Dimension ICON, Bruker Co., Germany). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (EDAX, AMETEK, USA) was applied to confirm the elemental composition of the samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out in a Bruker D2 Advance diffractometer (Germany) using Cu Ka (λ = 1.5405 Å) radiation at 40 kV. Data were collected in the range of 5–80° with step-width of 0.02. Raman spectra measurements were obtained on a HORIBA LabRAM HR spectrometer (Japan) with a 514 nm laser. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250XI, Thermo Scientific, USA) was applied to analyse the element type and atomic configurations of graphene nanosheets. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected on a Nicolet iS10 spectrometer (Nicolet Instrument Co., USA) in the range 4000-500 cm−1. Microstructures of the fracture sections and char residues were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi su1510, Hitachi Co., Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. The combustion performance of pure PVA and its composite films was investigated by the FTT-0001 microscale combustion calorimeter (MCC) (Fire Testing Technology Co., UK). Approximate 5 mg samples were heated from 90 °C to 750 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/s in an 80 cm3/min nitrogen stream flowing. Then, the gaseous pyrolysate was mixed with a 20 cm3/min stream of oxygen before entering a 900 °C combustor. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) measurement was conducted on a FTT0077 oxygen index instrument (Fire Testing Technology Co., UK) according to GB/T 2406.2-2009. The tensile mechanical properties of the samples were measured according to the GB 13022-91 on an electronic universal testing machine (3385H, Instron corporation, USA) at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min at room temperature. Five tests were performed on each material to calculate an average value. Dynamic mechanical properties of pure PVA and its composite films were evaluated using a TA Instruments DMA Q800 analyzer (USA) in the temperature range from 25 to 140 °C at a fixed frequency of 1Hz and a linear heating rate of 3 °C/min."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Electrochemical exfoliation of graphene nanosheets,"3.1 Electrochemical exfoliation of graphene nanosheets In this paper, DNS86 was chosen as the electrolyte and dispersant in the electrochemical exfoliation process. When a 10 V voltage was performed, graphite flake was enlarged and exfoliated into electrolyte solution (Fig. 2 a–c). After removing excess DNS86, the exfoliated products were then dispersed in water by sonication at 500 W for 1 h (Fig. 2d), forming homogeneous water-dispersible graphene dispersion. This graphene dispersion was stored for 3 weeks at room temperature and no apparent agglomeration (Fig. 2e) was observed. The electrochemical mechanism of preparing water-dispersible graphene in DNS86 aqueous solution is illustrated in Fig. 2f. Firstly, water molecules were electrolyzed to generate oxygen radicals (O·) and hydroxyl (OH·) at the anode. Secondly, oxidation at the edge sites and the formation of O2 resulted in expansion of the graphite layers, thus facilitating the intercalation of DNS86 anions within the graphitic layers. Then hydrophobic component of DNS86 anions adsorbed onto the graphene surface, due to the π-π interactions between graphene nanosheets and DNS86 anions. The hydrophilic moiety of DNS86 anions extended into the aqueous medium, forming the water-dispersible graphene suspension assisted with sonication. A typical TEM image in Fig. 3 a reveals that the electrochemically exfoliated graphene nanosheet shows thin flake and weak wrinkle structure with a lateral size around several micrometers. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image confirms that the exfoliated graphene nanosheets contain 3 layers. Besides, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) displays the hexagonal symmetric diffraction pattern, demonstrating highly crystalline structure of graphene nanosheets. To further characterize the graphene nanosheets, AFM analysis was performed. Fig. 3d shows the representative AFM image of graphene nanosheets with lateral dimension of several micrometers. The thickness calculated by the height profile is around 2.1 nm, which is corresponded to approximately 3 atomic layers in thickness [24]. This is in agreement with the HRTEM results. EDX analysis (Fig. 3f) on graphene nanosheets displays the presence of signals for S and N with weight percentage of 2.62 and 1.51% respectively, indicating that DNS86 molecules are absorbed on the surface of graphene nanosheets. XRD patterns of graphite and DGNS are shown in Fig. 4 a. Pristine graphite possesses a sharp reflection peak at 26.6° (d spacing = 0.34 nm) and another weak reflection peak at 54.7°, corresponding to (002) and (004) planes of graphite crystal respectively. In contrast, DGNS display a noticeably reduced and broad (002) reflection peak because of the short-range order between graphene nanosheets [25]. Meanwhile, a new peak appears at 8.8° (d spacing = 1.00 nm) because oxygen-containing functional groups are introduced into the surface of graphene nanosheets and DNS86 molecules are intercalated into the graphene layers during the electrochemical exfoliation process [26]. XRD result confirms that few-layer graphene nanosheets are successfully obtained via this simple electrochemical method. Raman spectrum is utilized to characterize the defects of graphene nanosheets and to estimate the layer number of the graphene nanosheets. Fig. 4b illustrates the comparative Raman spectra of graphite and DGNS. The typical D (structure defects), G (the breathing vibration of sp2 carbon atoms), and 2D (two phonon lattice vibrations) peaks can be seen. In comparison to ID/IG (0.07) of pristine graphite, the DGNS present a comparatively high ID/IG (0.96) value, indicating that the graphene nanosheets have defects and partially disordered structures. This result is due to the adsorption of DNS86 and oxygen-functionalities originating from the electrolytic oxidation. The radicals (e.g., HO∙) generated from water electrolysis will unavoidably destroy the graphitic structure during the electrochemical exfoliation process. Therefore, this value is slightly higher compared with reported from exfoliation using ultrasonication (Table S1, Supporting Information). Nevertheless, the ID/IG value of DGNS is less than 1.0, which is smaller than that of thermally or chemically reduced graphene oxide (~1.1–1.5) [27–29]. The position of the 2D peak is correlated to the layer number of the graphene nanosheets. The 2D peak position of DGNS is shifted by ~43 cm−1 in contrast to that of pristine graphite (i.e., 2645 cm−1 for exfoliated graphene, 2688 cm−1 for pristine graphite), suggesting the formation of few-layer graphene nanosheets through electrochemical exfoliation of graphite. Only carbon (97.57 at%) and oxygen (2.43 at%) are presented in the full-sale XPS scan of graphite (Fig. 5 a), which indicates that the graphite has a high purity. Nevertheless, the oxygen content of DGNS (Fig. 5b) increases to 13.04 at%, ascribing to the unavoidable oxidation during the electrochemical process and adsorbent DNS86. Additionally, the new peaks related to S 2p (168.6 eV) and N 1s (400.0 eV) appear in the XPS spectrum of DGNS, resulting from the noncovalent attachment of DNS86. Based on the detailed analysis of DGNS, the high-resolution spectrum of C 1s (Fig. 5c) can be divided into three peaks at 284.8, 285.6 and 286.8 eV corresponding to C–C/CC, C–O, and CO, respectively [30]. The C–C/CC peak is predominant, while the peaks attributed to the oxidized carbon groups are weak. Moreover, the high-resolution O 1s spectrum (Fig. 5d) presents C–O peak (533.1 eV) and CO/OSO peak (532.7 eV) [31]. The above results confirm that the surface of graphene nanosheets has been successfully modified with DNS86, and the oxidation level of the graphene nanosheets is low."
8,Dispersion of DGNS into PVA matrix and interfacial interaction,"3.2 Dispersion of DGNS into PVA matrix and interfacial interaction The exfoliation and dispersion of DGNS in the PVA matrix were investigated from TEM image of section of PVA composite film, as shown in Fig. 6 a. With a loading of 0.3 wt% DGNS, it is clear that DGNS demonstrate semi-transparent, wrinkled and ultrathin nanoplatelets in the PVA matrix, demonstrating that most DGNS are exfoliated into mono- or few-layer and well dispersed in the PVA matrix. With increasing the DGNS content up to ~1.0 wt%, remarkable aggregations of DGNS are observed in Fig. S1 (Supporting Information). The intense interfacial interaction between DGNS and matrix is an important factor in improving the property of composites. So FTIR spectra of the films (Fig. 6b) were conducted to understand the interaction between fillers and matrix. A wide and strong band at about 3270 cm−1 is observed in the spectrum of pure PVA, which is ascribed to the stretching vibration peak of hydroxyl. The change of wavenumbers for –OH stretching vibration is connected to hydrogen bonding [32,33]. In Fig. 6b, the –OH stretching vibration peak of PVA/DGNS composite films shifts to a lower wavenumber with the DGNS concentration increasing, indicating strong hydrogen bonds between the DGNS and –OH groups of PVA chains. Fig. 7 presents the SEM images of the fracture sections of pure PVA and its composite films. As for pure PVA, the fracture section is very smooth in Fig. 7a. With increasing the addition of DGNS, the roughness of the fracture sections of PVA/DGNS composite films (Fig. 7b–d) gradually increases as compared to that of pure PVA, implying strong interfacial interactions between the PVA molecular chains and DGNS [34]. Furthermore, at low content of DGNS loading, the graphene nanosheets cannot be observed in the fractured surface of PVA composite films, declaring the uniform dispersion and embedment of graphene nanosheets within PVA matrix [35]. However, when the amount of DGNS increases to 1.0 wt%, an obvious aggregation (indicated by red rectangle) of DGNS is seen in Fig. 7d. This result is consistent with the above TEM images (Fig. S1)."
9,Mechanical properties of PVA and its composite films,"3.3 Mechanical properties of PVA and its composite films Graphene hold great promise to improve the mechanical performance of polymer matrix due to extraordinary mechanical strength and large aspect ratio. The representative stress-strain behavior of pure PVA and its composite films is shown in Fig. 8 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1 . It is obviously seen that tensile strength of PVA/DGNS composite films depicts an enhancing trend when the content of DGNS is low. Compared with pure PVA film, the tensile strength of the composite containing 0.3 wt% DGNS increases by 50.1% from 61.9 to 92.9 MPa. The reinforcement effect is ascribed to the well-dispersion of DGNS in the polymer and strong interfacial interaction due to H-bonding between DGNS and polymer molecular chains, which contribute to an effective stress transfer from PVA chains to graphene nanosheets [36]. Nonetheless, with further increasing DGNS content to 1.0 wt% and 2.0 wt%, the strength declines on the contrary, which is caused by the aggregation of DGNS in the polymer (Fig. 7d). Besides, the tensile modulus of the PVA/DGNS composite films gradually enhance with the increase of DGNS dosage and the elongation at break presents a decrease trend. Especially, with the addition of 2 wt% DGNS, the tensile modulus obviously increases to 2.09 GPa, corresponding to 50.4% enhancement and the elongation at break declines by 74.0% from 22.3% to 5.8% in contrast to pure PVA. It is concluded that the stiffness of the PVA/DGNS composite films is strengthened due to the large aspect ratio of graphene nanosheets as well as the interfacial interaction between graphene and matrix, which restrict the movement of the PVA molecular chains. Compared with previously reported PVA/graphene composites (Table S2, Supporting Information), PVA/DGNS composite in this work shows a better improvement in tensile strength and tensile modulus. It is well known that well-established Halpin-Tsai model is widely performed to predict the Young's modulus of randomly or uniaxially distributed filler-reinforced composites. Therefore, we utilized this model to investigate the distribution of graphene nanosheets in the PVA matrix. The Halpin-Tsai equation was given in the following equations. (1)-(4): (1) E u = E P [ 1 + ( 2 L D / 3 T D ) ( η L V D ) 1 − ( η L V D ) ] (2) E r = E P [ 3 8 1 + ( 2 L D / 3 T D ) ( η L V D ) 1 − ( η L V D ) + 5 8 1 + ( 2 η T V D ) 1 − ( η T V D ) ] (3) η L = ( E D / E P ) − 1 ( E D / E P ) + ( 2 L D / 3 T D ) (4) η T = ( E D / E P ) − 1 ( E D / E P ) + 2 Herein, E u and E r are the Young's modulus of the PVA/DGNS composite with aligned graphene parallel to the surface of the sample film and randomly dispersed graphene, respectively. E P and E D represent the tensile moduli of PVA and graphene, respectively. L D , T D and V D refer to the average length, thickness, and volume content of DGNS. The E P is 1.39 GPa, obtained from the experiment, and E D is about 1.0 TPa [37]. The L D , T D of DGNS are around 1.47 μm and 2.22 nm according to the AFM image. The volume content of graphene was calculated from weight content w (wt%) by the following equation: (5) v = w ρ p w ρ p + ( 1 − w ) ρ D Where, v and w represent the volume content and mass content of graphene nanosheets, respectively. ρ p is the density of PVA matrix (1.3 g/cm3) and ρ D is the density of graphene (2.2 g/cm3) [37]. So, the volume fractions of DGNS in composite films are 0, 0.06, 0.18, 0.59 and 1.19 vol%, respectively. The experimental and theoretical data of PVA/DGNS composite films are plotted in Fig. 9 . When the loading amount of DGNS is lower than 0.18 vol%, the experimental values are slightly higher than the theoretical prediction values with random distribution of DGNS. This indicates that the graphene nanosheets are mainly randomly dispersed within PVA matrix, and there is an interfacial interaction between graphene nanosheets and PVA matrix, which offers an effective stress transfer for tension transfer between graphene nanosheets and PVA matrix [38]. However, at higher volume percentages of DGNS, the experimental data are lower than the theoretical values, due to the aggregation of graphene nanosheets in the composite films [39]. The storage modulus curves of pure PVA and its composite films are exhibited in Fig. 10 . It is found that all the PVA/DGNS composite films possess higher storage modulus than pure PVA. In particular, the maximum increment is obtained in PVA/DGNS-1.0 by 154.5% at 30 °C. The enhancement of storage modulus implies that the rigidity of composite films is increased by the addition of DGNS. This result reveals that DGNS restrict the motion of polymer chains, owning to the strong interfacial adhesion between the DGNS and the PVA matrix [40]."
10,Flame-retardant property and mechanism,"3.4 Flame-retardant property and mechanism MCC test was utilized to assess the flame-retardant properties of pure PVA and its composite films. The peak heat release rate (PHRR) and total heat released (THR) values are very important parameters to evaluate fire hazard of materials, and low values of PHRR and THR indicate high flame retardance. Fig. 11 presents the heat release rate (HRR) and THR plots of pure PVA and its composite films and the detailed data are summarized in Table 2 . Pure PVA has high PHRR value (494 W/g) and THR (23.4 kJ/g) during the combustion process. After incorporating DGNS into PVA matrix, both PHRR and THR of the PVA/DGNS composite films gradually decrease as the content of the DGNS increase. When the DGNS loading is up to 2.0 wt%, PHRR and THR values of PVA/DGNS-2.0 are declined to 193W/g and 21.6 kJ/g, corresponding to 60.9% and 7.7% reduction in contrast to pure PVA, respectively. To further assess the material flammability, the behavior of pure PVA and its composite films in an ignition scenario was measured using the Oxygen Index test, and the obtained LOI values are listed in Table 2. Pure PVA is a flammable polymeric material with a LOI of 19.4%. The LOI value of PVA/DGNS composite film shows a gradual increase with increasing DGNS content. By incorporating 2 wt% DGNS into PVA matrix, the LOI value only increases to 22.0%. The LOI test combined with the MCC data reveal that DGNS are effective nanofillers in enhancing the flame retardance of PVA material. According to previous reports [41,42], the mechanism of graphene in reducing the flammability of polymers was that it acted as “char reinforcers” in the condensed phase, so the char residues of pure PVA and its composite films were analyzed in detail. Fig. 12 shows the micromorphology of the char residues of pure PVA and PVA/DGNS-2.0 after combustion. As for the char layer of PVA, there are a lot of large holes on the surface. The incorporation of DGNS leads to a marked improvement in the compactness of char layer. This more compact char layer can impede the transfer of heat and gaseous products during combustion process and protect the underlying matrix from further burning. Furthermore, Raman spectra could be adopted to characterize graphitic degree of char residues and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 13 . The Raman spectra of the two samples exhibit two prominent peaks at about 1350 and 1590 cm−1. The former peak (called the D peak) is ascribed to the disordered or glassy carbon, while the latter (called the G peak) is assigned to the graphitized carbon. In general, the intensity ratio of D to G peaks (ID/IG) is employed to evaluate the graphitic degree of the char layer. A lower ratio of ID/IG corresponds to higher organized graphitic structure [43]. The ID/IG value of PVA/DGNS-2.0 (2.00) is significantly lower than that of pure PVA (3.18), suggesting that the presence of DGNS markedly improves the organized graphitic structure in the residual char. The char with higher organized graphitic structure performs a better barrier effect against the mass and heat transfer and enhances the fire resistance of the PVA composites during combustion process. EDX analysis was further conducted to obtain the detailed elemental information of char residues and the related results are presented in Fig. 14 . The C/O atomic ratio of PVA/DGNS-2.0 (0.52) is dramatically higher than that of pure PVA (0.32), suggesting that DGNS can effectively facilitate the formation of high graphitized char. The high graphitized char layer has high thermal oxidative resistance, which can retard the heat and mass transfer between the fire and matrix, enhancing the flame-retardant properties of the materials."
11,Conclusions,"In this work, DNS86-assisted electrochemical exfoliation of graphite was used to synthesize the water-dispersible graphene nanosheets. XPS spectra revealed that DNS86 was successfully adsorbed on the surface of graphene nanosheets. HRTEM and AFM evinced that the exfoliated DGNS were mainly composed of 3 layers. Subsequently, the water-dispersible graphene nanosheets were well-dispersed within PVA matrix and formed strong interfacial adhesion due to H-bonding between fillers and polymer molecular chains. Incorporation of 0.3 wt% DGNS into PVA matrix led to a remarkable improvement in tensile strength by 50.1%. A 50.4% increase in tensile modulus was obtained with adding 2 wt% DGNS. In addition, DGNS had good flame retardance to PVA material. The PVA/DGNS-2.0 showed 60.9% reduction in PHRR and 7.7% reduction in THR, in contrast to pure PVA. By the analysis of the char residue of the PVA/DGNS composites, the presence of graphene could perform a compact barrier char layer, protecting the underlying matrix during combustion."
