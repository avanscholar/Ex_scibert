0,Introduction,"It is well known that pure zirconia exhibits three polymorphs such as monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic phases [1]. The monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic phases are thermodynamically stable at a temperature of <1170 °C, 1170–2370 °C, and 2370–2680 °C (melting point), respectively. Because the phase transition among these phases is reversible, the structures of high-temperature phases cannot be maintained at room temperature. In addition, the phase transition from monoclinic to tetragonal causes large density change. Therefore, pure ZrO2 cannot be used for high-temperature applications. The tetragonal and the cubic phases can be stabilized by the addition of appropriate aliovalent cations, such as Y3+, Sc3+, La3+, Ca2+, and so on, at the temperatures below melting point [2]. Among them, yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is widely used as oxygen sensors, thermal barrier coatings, and solid oxide electrolyte ceramics because of the excellent strength, thermal stability, and ionic conductivity at high temperature [3–5]. Since YSZ has unique acid-base character and oxygen ion conductivity [6,7], it has been recently used as catalysts and catalyst supports for several reactions: YSZ effectively works as a catalyst for the ketonization of carboxylic acid [6] and ethanol-to-propylene reaction [7]. Unsaturated alcohols (UOLs) such as 3-buten-1-ol (3B1ol), 2-buten-1-ol (2B1ol), and 3-buten-2-ol (3B2ol) are currently manufactured from fossil-based feedstock. UOLs are valuable intermediates for the synthesis of medical drugs, agricultural chemicals, and functional polymers [8–12]. UOLs are also proposed as intermediates for the synthesis of 1,3-butadiene, which is an important bulk chemical used for producing rubbers and polymers [13–15]. 1,3-Butadiene is presently manufactured through the naphtha cracking. The supply of 1,3-butadiene has been influenced by the unstable price of crude oil as well as the increment of shale gas for a decade. Therefore, alternative routes for producing 1,3-butadiene are expected. To realize the low-carbon society via reducing the use of fossil sources, it is important that useful chemicals, as well as energy, are produced from recyclable resources of biomass [14]. Butanediols (BDOs) such as 2,3-, 1,3- and 1,4-butanediols could have been formed from biomass through fermentation [16,17]. In these situations, we have studied the vapor-phase catalytic dehydration of BDOs to UOLs over solid catalysts [18–31]. We have previously found that rare earth oxides such as CeO2, Er2O3, and Yb2O3 catalysts are effective for the selective conversion of BDOs to UOLs [18–23]. For these reactions, the crystalline phase of the oxides is one of the important factors for their catalytic activity and selectivity to each product. We have revealed that the catalytic activity of rare earth oxides for the dehydration of 1,3-butanediol (1,3-BDO) greatly depends on the crystalline phase as well as the crystalline size [20]. In theoretical investigations [21,22], about CeO2 which is especially effective for the dehydration of 1,3-BDO, oxygen defect sites on the cubic fluorite CeO2 (111) facets work as adsorption sites. In the dehydration of BDOs to UOLs, ZrO2 [24–26] and base-modified ZrO2 [27–32] are also effective as catalysts. In the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO), Zhang et al. reported that 3B1ol selectivity of 68.9% at a 1,4-BDO conversion of 94.6% was obtained over CaO supported on ZrO2 aerogel catalyst [32]. In the report, monoclinic and tetragonal phases coexist in the CaO-ZrO2 catalyst. In our previous work, a high 3B1ol selectivity of 89% at a 1,4-BDO conversion of 68% is reported over CaO supported on monoclinic zirconia (MZ) catalyst, which prepared by an impregnation method (CaO/MZ) [30]. In the active CaO/MZ catalysts calcined higher than 700 °C, a small diffraction of tetragonal ZrO2 phase was observed with the major monoclinic one. It is considered that Ca2+ diffused into ZrO2 lattice upon calcination over 700 °C with the change in crystal phase to tetragonal. In the dehydration of BDOs over the modified ZrO2, it is suggested that the crystalline phase of ZrO2 is an important factor for the activation of BDOs in the catalytic dehydration. However, it is still unclear which crystalline phase is effective for these reactions. Therefore, in this paper, we examined the dehydration of BDOs such as 1,3-, 1,4-, and 2,3-BDO (Scheme 1 ) over ZrO2 and yttria-stabilized ZrO2 to clarify the active crystalline phase of ZrO2 for these reactions, in addition to the dehydration of 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO). We also discussed the active sites for the dehydration of 1,3-BDO and the reaction mechanism."
1,Experimental,
2,Samples,"2.1 Samples ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals Industries, Ltd., and Y(NO3)3·6H2O was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A monoclinic zirconia (MZ) and yttria-stabilized zirconias with Y2O3 contents of 3.2 and 13.8 wt.% (YSZ) were supplied by Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd., Japan. The samples calcined in air at a prescribed temperature for 3 h were used for the reactions. Hereafter, YSZ samples with Y2O3 contents of 3.2 and 13.8 wt.%, which correspond to 3.5 and 14.8 mol%, are expressed as 3YSZ-T and 14YSZ-T, respectively, where T is the calcination temperature of the sample (oC). MZ-T also represents MZ sample calcined at T oC. Another series of Y-contained ZrO2 was prepared through a hydrothermal (HT) process using a solution of ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O and Y(NO3)3·5H2O. In the preparation of 3 mol% Y-containing ZrO2, for example, 0.368 g of Y(NO3)3·5H2O and 5.89 g ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O were dissolved in 20 cm3 of distilled water. Then, pH value of the solution was adjusted to 10 with 25 wt.% ammonia water under stirring without any additives such as amine, fatty acid, and alcohol. After the solution had been transferred into 100 cm3 Teflon-lined autoclave, HT treatment was performed at 200 °C for 24 h. The resulting precipitate was centrifuged, then washed, and dried at 110 °C for 18 h, and calcined at 900 °C for 3 h. Here, the Y-contained ZrO2 is named as HT-ZrO2. Reactant chemicals such as 1,3-BDO, 1,4-BDO, 2,3-BDO, and 1,5-PDO were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan. They were used for the catalytic reaction without any further purification."
3,Vapor-phase catalytic reactions,"2.2 Vapor-phase catalytic reactions The vapor-phase catalytic reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed flow reactor under an atmospheric pressure of N2 carrier gas with a flow rate of 30 cm3 min−1 at a temperature between 300 and 375 °C. After the catalyst had been heated in an N2 flow at the prescribed reaction temperature for 1 h, a reactant BDO was fed into the reactor at a liquid feed rate of 1.60 g h−1. The liquid effluent was collected in a dry ice-acetone trap every hour. The products were identified by gas chromatography (GC) with a mass spectrometer (GCMS-QP5050 A, Shimadzu) with a capillary column (DB-WAX, a length of 30 m, JW Scientific), and the quantitative analysis of the products was performed by a GC (FID GC-8 A, Shimadzu) with a capillary column (Inert Cap WAX-HT, an inner diameter of 0.53 mm and a length of 30 m, GL-Science). The gaseous products were analyzed by another GC (TCD GC-8 A, Shimadzu) with a packed column (VZ-7, a length of 6 m, GL-Science). The catalytic reaction was typically carried out for 5 h to assure the stability of catalytic activity. All the catalysts showed little decay in the initial period of 1 h so that we evaluated the catalytic activity by averaging the data of conversion and selectivity in the initial 1–5 h excluding the first 1 h. The selectivity to each product was defined as mol%."
4,Characterization of catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of catalysts The Y content in HT-ZrO2 samples was measured by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis using EDX-900HS (Shimadzu). The continuous scanning X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on New D8 ADVANCE (Bruker) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) to identify the crystal phase of each catalyst. The specific surface area (SA) of catalyst was calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method using the N2 isotherm at −196 °C. The thermogravimetry (TG) analysis of samples was carried out using Thermoplus 8120E2 (Rigaku) from the room temperature to 900 °C at a rate of temperature increment of 5 °C min−1. To estimate the basicity of the catalysts, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) profiles of adsorbed CO2 were measured by a self-made apparatus using the change in the conductivity of 1/1000 N NaOH solution, into which the desorbed CO2 was bubbled with N2 carrier gas [26,29]. The measurement conditions are the following: preheating the sample at 500 °C for 1 h; CO2 adsorption at room temperature for 72 h; desorption temperatures controlled from the room temperature to 700 °C at a rate of temperature increment of 10 °C min−1. The amounts of basic sites were estimated from neutralization-titration curves of the diluted NaOH solution. To estimate the acidity of the catalysts, TPD of adsorbed NH3 was also performed using BELCATII (Microtrac BEL Corp.) with thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The measurement conditions are the following: preheating the sample at 500 °C for 1 h; NH3 adsorption at 100 °C for 1 h; desorption temperatures controlled from 100 to 800 °C at an increment rate of 10 °C min−1. The TCD detector can detect water and other gases such as oxygen as well as NH3 if they are desorbed from the catalyst. Thus, we also performed TPD experiment for the sample only preheated at 500 °C without NH3 adsorption as a blank profile. A difference profile of TPD between NH3 adsorption and the blank was adapted as a NH3-TPD profile. The amounts of acidic sites were estimated from the integral of the NH3-TPD profile as a function of temperature."
5,Results and discussion,
6,HT-ZrO2 catalysts with different Y contents,"3.1 HT-ZrO2 catalysts with different Y contents In preliminary catalytic tests of Y-containing ZrO2, an HT process was adapted to obtain well-crystalized oxide particles of ZrO2. Fig. 1 shows XRD profiles of HT-ZrO2 catalysts with different Y contents, which were calcined at 900 °C. The crystal structure of ZrO2 without Y showed only a monoclinic phase. A tetragonal phase of ZrO2 increased with increasing Y content, the monoclinic phase disappeared and only a tetragonal phase existed at Y contents higher than 4 mol%. Table 1 shows the catalytic conversion of 1,3-BDO over the HT-ZrO2 catalysts with different Y contents. The catalyst samples had a relatively high specific surface area of 10-35 m2 g−1 even after calcination at 900 °C. They showed different catalytic activity depending on Y content. At Y content of 0 mol%, the monoclinic ZrO2 showed a low conversion and the lowest selectivity to UOLs. The catalytic activity was increased with increasing Y content up to 6 mol% over the HT-ZrO2 catalysts: the selectivity to UOLs was maximized at a Y content of 3 mol%, and the conversion of 1,3-BDO was maximized at a Y content of 6 mol%. Therefore, the crystal phase and the specific surface area of HT-ZrO2 catalysts varied with Y content, and also their catalytic performance varied. In the HT process followed by the calcination at 900 °C, we confirmed that a well-crystalized tetragonal zirconia was obtained with the yttria stabilizer. Indeed, Y species could be dispersed into zirconia crystal lattice with the transformation. Then, in the following sections, we investigated effect of calcination temperature on the commercially available 3YSZ and 14YSZ together with a MZ catalyst."
7,"Physical properties of 3YSZ, 14YSZ and MZ catalysts","3.2 Physical properties of 3YSZ, 14YSZ and MZ catalysts In the present work, 3YSZ and 14YSZ samples as well as MZ sample were calcined at different temperatures. Table 2 summarizes specific surface area (SA) of ZrO2 catalysts calculated by the BET method. The specific surface area of these samples decreased with increasing the calcination temperature. The specific surface area of 3YSZ-800 was about twice as large as MZ-800. Particle size, d BET, was calculated by the following equation assuming that the particle was a sphere: d BET = 6/(ρ×SA), where ρ was a density of ZrO2. Comparing the values of YSZs and MZ calcined at the same temperature, YSZs have a smaller particle size and a larger specific surface area than MZ does. Fig. 2 shows the continuous scanning XRD patterns of the YSZs calcined at various temperatures as well as MZ. There is no obvious change in diffraction pattern by calcination for both YSZs and MZ samples (profiles for MZ-600 and MZ-1000 not shown), while the diffraction peaks become sharp and strong. This means the growth of crystallites in the samples by calcination. In order to clarify the crystal structures of YSZs, we performed Rietveld refinement for step scanning XRD patterns of 3YSZ and 14YSZ samples calcined at 1000 °C. Fig. S1 and Table S1 in supplementary information show the refined results. All peaks in the profile of 3YSZ-1000 and 14YSZ-1000 samples (Fig. S1) were indexed as tetragonal YSZ phase (space group: P42/nmc, No. 137-2). The refined structure of tetragonal phase in 3YSZ is a typical YSZ, in which a cubic phase extends in a direction toward [0 0 1], while that of 14YSZ is extremely close to cubic phase (F m -3 m, No. 225). No diffractions assigned to other crystal phases such as Y2O3 was observed. Indexes shown in Fig. 2 are assigned from the Rietveld refinement (Fig. S1 and Table S1). A particle size, d XRD, was calculated from the full width at half maximum by Sherrer formula, d XRD = Kλ/(βcosθ), where K ( = 0.9), λ, β, and θ are shape factor, X-ray wavelength, full width at half maximum, and Bragg’s diffraction angle, respectively. The calculated dXRD values are also listed in Table 2. The crystallite size simply increased as the calcination temperature increased. The crystallite size, d XRD, well agrees with the particle size, d BET (Table 2), so that the individual catalyst particles are composed of a crystallite. Fig. S2 displays the TEM images of 3YSZ samples calcined at different temperatures. The as-received 3YSZ and 3YSZ calcined at 800 and 1000 °C had the particle size of 10–20, 15–30, and 40–50 nm, respectively. These sizes are consistent with the results shown in Table 2, indicating that the particles observed in TEM indicate the primary particles. There is no clear difference in the shape of the particles among them. Fig. 3 a depicts the TPD profiles of CO2 adsorbed on 3YSZ calcined at different temperatures together with MZ-800. It can be seen that the amount of basic sites simply decreases with increasing the calcination temperature as the specific surface area decreases. Fig. S3 depicts the TPD profiles of NH3 adsorbed on 3YSZ and MZ-800 with and without NH3 adsorption. Because the NH3-TPD used a TCD detector, water and other gases such as oxygen can be detected if they are adsorbed. In the samples without NH3 adsorption (Fig. S3), a broad desorption signal observed at temperatures of 400–800 °C was composed of water, which disappeared in an individual experiment after the desorbed gas had been flowed in a zeolite filter for H2O removal. Thus, the broad peak in the blank TPD was confirmed to be attributed from the water desorbed from the catalyst sample. Fig. 3b depicts the NH3-TPD profiles obtained from the difference profiles for 3YSZ and MZ-800. The amounts of basic and acidic sites are also summarized in Table 2 together with the density of basic and acidic sites. Their amounts varied with the calcination temperature. The base density of YSZ catalysts is almost constant, and this indicates that the surface density of basic sites is independent of the calcination temperature. This will be discussed in the Section 3.5."
8,Dehydration of several butanediols over YSZ and MZ catalysts,"3.3 Dehydration of several butanediols over YSZ and MZ catalysts In the dehydration of 1,3-BDO at 325 °C, the conversion of 1,3-BDO and the selectivity to UOLs were changed with calcination temperature (Fig. 4 ). Details of the selectivity to each product were listed in the supplemental information of Table S2. A maximum value of the 1,3-BDO conversion was obtained over 3YSZ-900. In 3YSZ samples, the selectivity to UOLs became higher as the calcination temperature increased up to 900 °C, and then became almost constant at calcination temperatures higher than 900 °C. It is noted that a high temperature of 900 °C, which had the highest acid density (Table 2), would be required to construct the active centers on the 3YSZ. At higher than 900 °C of calcination, the conversion of 1,3-BDO decreased with increasing the calcination temperature due to the decrease of the specific surface area. In 14YSZ samples, a maximum conversion was obtained at calcination of 800 °C. Changes in catalytic activity of 3YSZ and 14YSZ with calcination temperature were similar to each other, while 3YSZ showed slightly higher selectivity. The highest selectivity to UOLs of 97.6% was obtained at the 1,3-BDO conversion of 62.4% over 3YSZ-900. In contrast, no significant increment was observed in both the selectivity to UOLs as well as the 1,3-BDO conversion for the MZ samples. As for the by-products through dehydrogenation such as butanone and 3-buten-2-one (Table S2), the selectivity to these products over YSZ samples decreased with increasing the calcination temperature. The calcination at high temperatures reduces the dehydrogenation ability of YSZ samples so that the dehydration ability is enhanced at high calcination temperatures. Fig. 5 shows the changes in the catalytic activity of YSZ and MZ catalysts for the dehydration of 1,4-BDO with calcination temperature. In a similarly way to the 1,3-BDO conversion, the conversion of 1,4-BDO and selectivity to 3B1ol over 3YSZ were changed with calcination temperature, while details of the selectivity are summarized in Table S3. The selectivity to 3B1ol increased with increasing the calcination temperature, while the selectivity to THF decreased. The conversion of 1,4-BDO decreased with increasing the calcination temperature, because of the decrease in specific surface area. In the comparison of tetragonal and monoclinic zirconia calcined at 500 °C, we had considered that MZ was more effective than YSZ for the dehydration of 1,4-BDO [27]. But the catalytic activity of 3YSZ, as well as 14YSZ, was drastically changed by calcination, and it was found that 3YSZ and 14YSZ catalysts were more effective for the UOLs production than MZ when they were calcined at temperatures higher than 750 °C. It is suggested that 3YSZ and 14YSZ are superior to MZ as a catalyst for this reaction. In the dehydration of 1,4-BDO, 3YSZ and 14YSZ show a similar change in the catalytic activity with calcination temperature, but 3YSZ shows a slight high selectivity. The highest selectivity to 3B1ol of 75.3% was obtained at the 1,4-BDO conversion of 26.1% over 3YSZ-1050. In our previous work, a high 3B1ol selectivity of 89% at the 1,4-BDO conversion of 68% was obtained over CaO/MZ [30]. For the dehydration of 1,4-BDO, the activity of 3YSZ is not sufficient at all, whereas it is suggested that 3YSZ is promising as catalyst support for CaO. Since monoclinic and tetragonal phases coexist in the CaO/MZ [30], further improvement of activity would be expected by unifying the catalyst surface to a tetragonal phase which was advantageous for the dehydration of 1,4-BDO. We will examine the catalytic activity of CaO-supported on YSZ near future. Table 3 shows the effect of calcination temperature of ZrO2 catalysts in the dehydration of 2,3-BDO. No such drastic changes as shown in Figs. 4 and 5 was observed in the dehydration of 2,3-BDO. Furthermore, the reactivity of 2,3-BDO over 3YSZ, 14YSZ, and MZ catalysts at 325 °C was lower than those of the other butanediols. In the dehydration of 2,3-BDO, 14YSZ was superior to 3YSZ and MZ in terms of the 3B2ol selectivity. Furthermore, as for the selectivity to each product, the selectivity to acetoin as a dehydrogenated product was almost constant, which is different from the fact in the reaction of 1,3-BDO that the dehydrogenated products over YSZ samples decreased with increasing the calcination temperature (Table S2). In addition, in the dehydration of 1,5-PDO, as shown in Table S4, the reactivity of 1,5-PDO is quite similar to that of 2,3-BDO. This suggests that effective phase of ZrO2 is different depending on the position of OH group of BDOs, and that the mechanism of the dehydration of 2,3-BDO and 1,5-PDO is different from that of 1,3-BDO and 1,4-BDO. Fig. 6 shows the changes in the formation rate of UOLs per unit surface area in the dehydration of BDOs as well as 1,5-PDO with calcination temperature. The formation rate of UOLs per unit surface area can be defined as the intrinsic activity of catalyst sample. In the dehydration of 1,3-BDO and 1,4-BDO over YSZ catalysts, the formation rates of UOLs increased with increasing the calcination temperature of YSZ in a similar way. In contrast, in the dehydration of 2,3-BDO and 1,5-PDO over YSZ, the formation rate remained almost unchanged even when the calcination temperature was increased. In the dehydration of 1,5-PDO, we have reported that MgO/MZ is more effective than CaO/MZ [33]. Nemec et al. have reported that a cation with an ionic radius smaller than zirconium such as Mg2+ is hard to dissolve in zirconia and to stabilize the tetragonal phase when it is added into zirconia, followed by calcination at high temperatures [34]. The addition of Mg into zirconia makes it difficult for the tetragonal structure to be stabilized as compared with the addition of Ca in the XRD patterns. For the dehydration of 2,3-BDO, we reported that BaO/MZ and CaO/MZ were effective [31]. These are additive elements that could stabilize either tetragonal or cubic phase. 14YSZ was better than MZ and 3YSZ in terms of the formation rate of 3B2ol in the dehydration of 2,3-BDO. Since the crystalline phase of 14YSZ is tetragonal, which is close to cubic, cubic zirconia could also improve the catalytic activity. There is still room for discussion on the dehydration of 2,3-BDO. Fig. 7 summarizes an intrinsic activity of YSZ-900 and MZ-600 as well as the selectivity to UOLs compared with other catalysts reported in the conversion of 1,3-BDO. CeO2 shows the highest formation rate of UOLs [19,20] with a selectivity to UOLs of 94.1% at a conversion of 72.8%, while Lu2O3 shows the second highest UOLs selectivity of 93.9% at a conversion of 29.0% [19]. Among the YSZ catalysts we tested, 3YSZ-900 showed the highest UOLs selectivity of 98.1% at a conversion of 66.2%, as shown in Table 4 . Thus, it was found that 3YSZ catalysts were the most selective for UOLs formation in the dehydration of 1,3-BDO. Because the specific surface area (34.3 m2 g−1) of 3YSZ-900 is much higher than those of CeO2 and Lu2O3 calcined at 1000 °C, which are 13.2 and 14.1 m2 g−1, respectively [35], the intrinsic activity of 3YSZ-900 is lower than the rare earth oxides (Fig. 7). In the dehydration of 1,4-BDO, on the other hand, the 3B1ol selectivity of 64.6% (Table S3) over 3YSZ-900 is lower than that of CaO-modified MZ calcined at 800 °C (89.3% at a conversion of 95.2% [30]), which is the best catalytic performance as far as we know."
9,"Catalytic activity of YSZ in the dehydration of 1,3-BDO under different reaction conditions","3.4 Catalytic activity of YSZ in the dehydration of 1,3-BDO under different reaction conditions Table 4 shows the effect of N2 carrier gas flow rate on the dehydration of 1,3-BDO over 3YSZ-900 at 325 °C. The conversion of 1,3-BDO depended on the flow rate, although the stable conversion was obtained at a constant carrier gas flow rate. The highest conversion of 1,3-BDO was attained at a flow rate of 60 cm3 min−1. Fig. S4 depicts TG profiles for the fresh 3YSZ-900 and the samples used in an N2 carrier gas of 7.5 and 30 cm3 min−1 for 5 h. In the flow rate of 30 cm3 min−1, it was found that the amount of deposited carbon was half of that at 7.5 cm3 min−1. Because a low carrier gas flow rate means a high partial pressure of the reactant of 1,3-BDO, carbon deposition readily occurs at a high partial pressure of 1,3-BDO. It is suggested that the high partial pressure of 1,3-BDO would affect the chemical steps including the adsorption of 1,3-BDO and the desorption of the product UOLs although clear explanation cannot be made. It should be notable that the carrier gas flow rate significantly affects the catalytic activity and the carbon deposition. Table 5 shows the effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic activity of 3YSZ-900 for the dehydration of 1,3-BDO. The 1,3-BDO conversion increased with increasing the reaction temperature. The selectivity to UOLs decreased with increasing the reaction temperature, while the selectivity to 1,3-butadiene (BD), ethanol, and 2-butanone (MEK) increased. We observed other by-products including propylene, acetone, and unidentified products, which were also increased at higher reaction temperatures. Thus, high temperatures would induce the further dehydration and the decomposition of UOLs. Table 6 shows the conversion of 1,3-BDO and the selectivity to each product over 3YSZ-900 at 325 °C at different contact times of W/F, where W and F are catalyst weight and feed rate of 1,3-BDO, respectively. The conversion of 1,3-BDO increased with increasing W/F. On the contrary, the selectivity to UOLs decreased with increasing W/F, while the selectivity to BD, ethanol, and 2-butanone (MEK) increased. It is suggested that secondary dehydration, isomerization, dehydrogenation, decomposition, and polymerization of UOLs would proceed at high W/F, resulting in the decrease of selectivity to UOLs. Fig. 8 shows a long run test of the dehydration of 1,3-BDO over 3YSZ-900 at 325 °C. The 1,3-BDO conversion and the selectivity to UOLs were maintained at a high level during 38 h. The color of the used catalyst was changed from white to light gray. TG analyses of fresh and used 3YSZ-900 catalysts were performed to confirm the carbon deposition (Fig. S5). The difference in the weight change, which was calculated by subtracting the weight loss at the temperatures 200–400 °C of the fresh catalyst from that of the used one, would be attributed to carbon deposition. The weight of carbon deposited on 3YSZ-900 after the 38-h reaction was only 1.2 wt.%. Thus, the negligible carbon deposition would cause the stable catalytic activity."
10,"Speculation on the active center for the dehydration of 1,3-BDO","3.5 Speculation on the active center for the dehydration of 1,3-BDO In Section 3.2, we have characterized the base-acid property of 3YSZ and MZ-800. The samples have basic and acid sites whose amounts and their density vary with the calcination temperature. In the previous study, the catalytic activity of Er2O3 for the dehydration of 1,3-BDO was reduced in a carrier gas containing CO2 and NH3 [19]. Thus, we examined poisoning experiments using CO2 and NH3 during the reaction (Table S5). Over 3YSZ-900 and MZ-600, however, neither CO2 nor NH3 acted as a poison. 1,3-BDO might be adsorbed on the active sites more strongly than CO2 and NH3. Because the strong adsorptive interaction between 1,4-BDO and an active CaO/MZ catalyst was observed [33], we have still room for the further research. This results seemingly indicate that the reaction is not catalyzed by base and acid. Thus, unfortunately, we cannot conclude the base-acid sites play an active center in the dehydration of 1,3-BDO at the present time. We have previously reported that rare earth oxides such as CeO2, Er2O3, and Yb2O3 catalysts are effective for the selective conversion of 1,3-BDO to UOLs [18–20]. The crystalline phase of the oxides is the same cubic phase of either fluorite of CeO2 or bixbyite of Ln2O3. In the case of CeO2, we reported that the UOLs selectivity increased with increase in crystallite sizes induced by calcination at high temperatures together with the increment of the formation rate per unit surface area [20]. In theoretical investigations, oxygen defect sites on the cubic fluorite CeO2 with (111) facets work as adsorption sites for the activation of 1,3-BDO [21,22]. Also, (222) facets of cubic Er2O3 provide adsorption sites for the dehydration of 1,4-BDO [23,36]. In the present study, to discuss the active center of YSZ for the dehydration of 1,3-BDO, the crystalline model of tetragonal ZrO2 phase was presented in Fig. S6, which dipicts several cross sections of tetragonal ZrO2. Fig. 9 a and b, which are the top three layers of Fig. S6d and S6c, show a (101) facet of tetragonal ZrO2 with and without an oxygen defect, respectively. The most stable facets of ZrO2 are reported to be (101) of tetragonal ZrO2, which is crystallographically the same facets as cubic ZrO2 (111) [37–39]. In a simple compositional calculation of YSZ, which is expressed by Zr(1-x)YxO2(1-0.5x), where x is mol% of Y, 3YSZ with a Y content of 3.5 mol% contains oxygen vacancy in 0.72% of oxygen-occupied sites of the bulk YSZ crystallite. This means that 1 out of 139 oxygen-occupied sites must be vacant in 3YSZ. In the present YSZ, it is speculated that oxygen defect sites on the (101) facets of tetragonal ZrO2 provide adsorption sites of 1,3-BDO, in a similar way to the cubic CeO2 [21,22]. On the stable (222) facets of cubic rare earth oxides such as Yb2O3, which is also active for the selective dehydration of 1,3-BDO [19], oxygen vacancies occupy the one fourth of surface oxygen anion sites [20,36]. Therefore, it is reasonable that Y3+ ions in YSZ could induce the formation of oxygen vacancies on the stable faces of tetragonal ZrO2 (101), as shown in Fig. 9a. Therefore, three cations such as Zr4+ and Y3+ could be exposed on the oxygen defect site of the (101) surface of tetragonal ZrO2 and the defect is surrounded by six O2− anions, as seen in Fig. 9a. In an analogous way to CeO2 [20,21], it is considered the exposed Zr4+ and Y3+ would act as the adsorption points for OH groups of 1,3-BDO, while an O2− anion can coordinate a hydrogen at position 2 of 1,3-BDO, as illustrated in Fig. 10 . In the formation of 3B2ol, for example, O2− and Y3+ extract the hydrogen and the OH group of position 1 of 1,3-BDO, respectively, where Zr4+ acts as an anchor of the adsorption of position-3 OH. In the mechanism illustrated in Fig. 10, the abstraction of position-2 hydrogen and position-1 OH group could proceed simultaneously. It is speculated that the basic site of O2− induced by the Y3+ substituted in ZrO2 plays an important role for the abstraction of position-2 H atom from 1,3-BDO. Although CO2 as well as NH3 did not poison the surface of 3YSZ (Table S5). In the case of CeO2, the redox cycle between Ce3+ and Ce4+ is speculated to play an important role in the dehydration of 1,3-BDO [20,21]. Because both Y and Zr do not have such redox property as CeO2 has, the reaction can be explained by the aforementioned base-acid concerted mechanism, and otherwise-unexplained. In the reaction mechanism for the dehydration of other diols, an essential role of oxygen defect site of YSZ catalysts would be the same as that of 1,3-BDO. Because a difference in the reactants is distance between OH group and another OH group, the distance could affect the adsorption structure on the oxygen defect site of YSZ. The adsorption structure in Fig. 10 could be stabilized with ring coordination of a seven-membered-ring coordination of Y3+OCCCOZr4+ as well as 2 six-membered rings of O2−HCCOZr4+ and O2−HCCOY3+. In a similar manner, 1,4-BDO has the adsorption structure with an eight-membered-ring coordination of Y3+OCCCCOZr4+ and 2 six-membered rings of O2−HCCOZr4+ and O2−HCCOY3+. In contrast, 1,5-BDO would form nine-membered-ring coordination of Y3+OCCCCCOZr4+, which is unstable with the strained structure. In the case of 2,3-BDO, the adsorption structure has 3 six-membered-ring coordination such as Y3+OCCOZr4+, O2−HCCOZr4+, and O2−HCCOY3+, in which each coordination could be stable but the adsorption structure of 2,3-BDO with the 3 six-membered rings would be highly strained. Thus, the reactivity of 1,5-PDO and 2,3-BDO is lower than the others. However, we need further investigation on the base-acid concerted mechanism for the dehydration of BDOs in the near future."
11,Conclusions,"Vapor-phase catalytic dehydration of BDOs was investigated over YSZ catalysts as well as MZ. It is suggested that YSZ is superior to MZ as a catalyst for the dehydration of 1,3-BDO and 1,4-BDO. Drastic changes in activity with calcination temperature were observed in the dehydration of 1,3-BDO and 1,4-BDO over YSZ catalysts, while no significant changes were observed in the dehydration of 2,3-BDO and 1,5-PDO. In the dehydration of 1,3-BDO at 325 °C, the UOLs selectivity exceeded 98% at the 1,3-BDO conversion of 66% over 3YSZ calcined at 900 °C, and the catalytic activity was stable for at least 38 h. Especially, the UOLs selectivity over 98% is the highest value we even obtained in the dehydration of 1,3-BDO, which is superior to an excellent CeO2 catalyst. In addition, the flow rate of nitrogen carrier gas significantly affects the catalytic activity and the carbon deposition in the dehydration of 1,3-BDO. In the dehydration of 1,4-BDO at 325 °C, the highest selectivity to 3B1ol of 75.3% at the 1,4-BDO conversion of 26.1% was obtained over 3YSZ calcined at 1050 °C. The catalytic activity, however, is inferior to the previously reported CaO/MZ catalyst. In the dehydration of 2,3-BDO at 325 °C, the highest selectivity to 3B2ol of 54.3% at the 2,3-BDO conversion of 8.9% was obtained over 14YSZ calcined at 1000 °C. In the dehydration of 1,5-PDO at 325 °C, the highest selectivity to 4P1ol of 37.9% at the 1,5-PDO conversion of 10.3% was obtained over MZ calcined at 800 °C. The reactivity of 2,3-BDO and 1,5-PDO over YSZ and MZ catalysts at 325 °C was lower than that of 1,3-BDO and 1,4-BDO. Structures of active sites for the dehydration of 1,3-BDO were discussed using a crystal model of tetragonal ZrO2 and a probable model structure of active sites was proposed. Oxygen defect sites are inevitably generated on the stable faces of tetragonal ZrO2 (101), as seen in Fig. 9a. A defect site, which exposes three cations such as Zr4+ and Y3+, is surrounded by six O2− anions. The exposed Zr4+, Y3+, and O2− would compose an adsorption site for the tridentate coordination of a 1,3-BDO molecule, which includes an interaction between a position-2 hydrogen of 1,3-BDO and an O2− anion on the edge of the defect and other interactions between OH groups of 1,3-BDO and Y3+ and Zr4+ cations on the defect. The catalytic reaction over the YSZ could be explained by tridentate coordination followed by the reaction sequence that the position-2 hydrogen is firstly abstracted by a basic O2− anion and then the position-1 hydroxyl group is subsequently or simultaneously abstracted by an acidic Y3+ cation to produce 3-buten-2-ol. Another OH group at position 3 plays an important role of anchoring 1,3-BDO to the catalyst surface through the interaction with the exposed Zr4+ cation. Thus, it is speculated that the selective dehydration of 1,3-butanediol over YSZ catalyst proceeds via a base-acid concerted mechanism through tridentate coordination, as shown in Fig. 10."
