0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is currently used in industry for a number of purposes, mainly in refineries and chemical plants for the production of a variety of chemicals. The interest in hydrogen has significantly increased in recent years in the prospect of its use as a fuel. In this respect, hydrogen is a high-energy-yield non-polluting fuel, particularly when used in fuel cells. However, almost 90% of hydrogen is currently produced from fossil fuels, mainly by steam reforming of natural gas and petroleum. Consequently, there have been intensive efforts in the development of technologies for the production of hydrogen from renewable resources, such as biomass or by electrolysis of water using wind and solar energy. Among the various technologies, which have been proposed for renewable hydrogen production, steam reforming of biomass-derived compounds, mainly ethanol (reaction (1)), either in the gas [1–4] or liquid [5] phase, has given promising results: (1) C2H5OH+3H2O→2CO2 +6H2,ΔH =173.1kJmol−1 A drawback of bio-fuel reforming technologies is related to the relatively complex processing requirements and to the need for high temperature [4] or pressure [5], which increase the overall process cost and reduce efficiency. Nevertheless, several investigations performed during the last three decades have shown that it is possible to photocatalytically produce hydrogen under ambient conditions with the use of irradiated semiconductors and water–alcohol mixtures [6–14]. In these studies, the rate of hydrogen production has been found to be much higher, compared to that obtained from photocatalytic cleavage of pure water. This has been attributed to the effect of added alcohol, which acts as sacrificial electron donor and consumes photogenerated holes and/or oxygen, thereby decreasing the rates of electron-hole recombination and H2–O2 back reaction [15–18]. Among the various semiconductors investigated for the photocatalytic production of hydrogen, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been intensively studied because of its favorable band-gap energy and flat band potential and because of its high chemical and photochemical stability. Photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is greatly enhanced in the presence of noble metals deposited on its surface. This has been attributed to the formation of a Schottky barrier at the metal/semiconductor interface, which leads to electron trapping and efficient charge separation [19]. Several different metals have been tried and reported in numerous publications [6–8,10–14,20–23]. The general conclusion is in favor of the Pt/TiO2 system. This is also the conclusion of the present work, as it will be shown below. The principal issue motivating recent studies on photocatalytic alcohol reforming is materials structure and composition [11,24–26]. Doping of titania has been studied in an effort to enhance its light absorption in the Visible. It has thus been reported that alter-valent doping enhances photocatalytic hydrogen evolution but doping with smaller valence metals decreases efficiency [27]. Non-metal doping is also a recent subject of research [28,29] while some studies focus on dye-sensitization in the Visible [11,30]. Regarding the mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen production from alcohol–water mixtures, reaction (1) represents the overall scheme, however, several intermediate steps have been detected. Metal sites trap electrons and reduce H+ to molecular hydrogen [7,8,20]. H+ is generated by interaction of holes with electron donors, i.e. in the case of water–alcohol mixtures, with both water and alcohol [8,20]. The oxidation of these two substances is described by the following reactions (2) and (3) (the second one written for the case of ethanol): (2) 2 h + + H 2 O → 2 H + + 1 2 O 2 or H + + OH (3) 2 h + + C 2 H 5 OH → 2 H + +C H 3 CHO These two reaction schemes, which do not exhaust all reported possibilities [6–16,20–22], explain how hydrogen ions are generated by oxidation of water and alcohol. The byproducts of these reactions, such as CH3CHO, are responsible for further reactions and further hydrogen ion production together with additional byproducts. Thus small quantities of aldehydes and organic acids have indeed been detected in the liquid phase [6–8,10,12] while in the gas phase, only H2 and CO2 have been detected [10]. Recent studies have established that irradiation of aqueous solutions of organic compounds under anaerobic conditions in the presence of Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst results in the production of gas phase hydrogen, which is accompanied by evolution of CO2 originating from degradation of the organic substrate [20,31]. This has been the case for all organic compounds investigated so far, including a variety of alcohols and organic acids [31] as well as azodyes [20] while carbohydrates, such as mono-, di- and poly-saccharides, are also under study in our laboratories. Quantification of results showed that the process may be envisaged as photo-induced reforming of organic compounds under ambient conditions [20,31]. Based on the above background, the present work studies photocatalytic alcohol reforming in the presence of highly efficient nanocrystalline titania films using a low-power excitation source. It will be seen that the proposed design is very promising for practical applications."
1,Experimental,
2,Photocatalyst preparation and characterization,"2.1 Photocatalyst preparation and characterization All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and Merck. They were of the best quality available and were used as received. Water was purified by using a Millipore installation. Titania films were deposited by following the previously reported procedure [32–34]. Briefly, 1.4g of the non-ionic surfactant Triton X-100 [polyoxyethylene-(10) isooctylphenyl ether] was mixed with 7.6ml of ethanol, followed by addition of 1.36ml of glacial acetic acid and 0.72ml of titanium isopropoxide under vigorous stirring. Self-organization of the surfactant in this original sol creates organized assemblies that act as templates defining nanoparticle size. The surfactant is burned out during calcination. After a few minutes stirring, a glass slide, which was previously thoroughly washed, sonicated in ethanol and dried in a N2 stream, was dipped in the above sol and withdrawn fast by hand. After leaving the film to dry in air for a few minutes, it was calcined in an oven. The temperature was raised at a heating rate of 20°C/min to 550°C and left at that temperature for about 10min. When the film was taken out of the oven it was transparent and optically uniform. The above procedure was repeated five more times. The mass of titania deposited on the slide after six dipping and calcination steps was approximately 7mg (that is about 3.5mg on each side of the slide). The area of the slide covered by titania film was 4.9cm×2.5cm=12.25cm2. Metals were deposited on titania films by adsorption from aqueous solutions containing about 5×10−4 M of one of the following metal salts: Na2PtCl4·xH2O; Na2AuCl4·2H2O; RuCl3·xH2O; RhCl3·xH2O; and others. After the last layer of titania was deposited and immediately after the film was taken out from the oven, the slide was submerged in the solution and was left there for half-an-hour in the dark. Then it was washed, dried and subjected to UV radiation for 15min for each side of the slide. UV treatment is made in order to assure reduction of cationic species to neutral metallic nanocrystals. Characterization of the size and dispersion of metal nanoparticles on titania films is currently under investigation in our laboratories and will be an object of a future publication Fig. 1 ."
3,Experimental setup and procedures,"2.2 Experimental setup and procedures The reactor used in this work was a pyrex cylinder of 4.4cm diameter and 10cm long, with provisions for gas inlet and outlet. Inside the cylinder were placed four microscope slides covered on both sides with the titania-metal catalyst. Around the glass cylinder were fitted four commercial Black-Light tubes of 10cm active length, each of 4W electric power. Black-Light is an ideal excitation source for titania since its spectrum coincides with band-gap excitation of this semiconductor, as can be seen in Fig. 2 . The light intensity reaching directly to a slide facing one light source was measured to be 0.4mW/cm2 for the side facing lamp and it was 0.26mW/cm2 for the opposite side. Since the two sides support films of equal geometry we may accept an average irradiance of 0.33mW/cm2. However, this value corresponds to the intensity of light coming from the lamp facing catalyst and does not take into account light coming from the other three lamps. This adds to the total intensity of light, which was estimated to be approximately 0.80mW/cm2. Since the total film surface was 8cm×12.25cm=98cm2, it is concluded that the approximate average incident radiation power on the photocatalyst was 78mW. The reactor was filled with water–alcohol mixtures. The total volume of the solution was 85–90ml. Experiments were conducted under Ar flow of 20cm3/min, which served as a means of collection and transfer of product H2 to the analysis system. The pH of the solution was the natural pH of the water–alcohol mixtures without acid, base or salt addition. The intensity of radiation at the position of the catalyst was measured with an Oriel Radiant Power Meter. Detection of hydrogen was made online by using an SRI 8610C gas-chromatograph and Ar as carrier gas. Samples were periodically collected via an automatic gas sampling valve and the concentration of H2 present in the reactor effluent was determined as a function of time of irradiation. Calibration of the GC signal was accomplished with the use of a standard mixture of 0.25% H2 in Ar. Comparison between the signal of the sample with that of the standard was made by calculating the areas of the corresponding GC peaks."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Photocatalyst characterization,"3.1 Photocatalyst characterization The characteristics of the titania films used in the present work have been described in previous publications [32–34]. Briefly, films consist of anatase nanocrystals of about 15nm average size. Size polydispersity is limited and the active surface area is around 110m2/g. Such films have been proven to be very efficient in dye photodegradation experiments [32–34] and also in Dye-sensitized Solar Cells [34]. As it will be seen below, they gave very encouraging results also for photocatalyzed alcohol reforming. The absorption spectrum of such a film is shown in Fig. 1. The periodic ripples in the tail of the spectrum are due to interference fringes and they can be exploited to estimate the film thickness [35]. By assuming an index of refraction around 2.0, the thickness of these films was found about 1.3μm. Such films are transparent and since there is a perfect matching between absorption and Black-Light tube emission, they are conveniently excited at bang-gap without internal energy losses."
6,Effect of the nature of the deposited metal,"3.2 Effect of the nature of the deposited metal No hydrogen evolution was detected in this work in the absence of a metal catalyst deposited on the titania film or in the absence of a sacrificial agent (alcohol in the present case). Several metals have been tested in order to choose the one giving optimum results. Table 1 lists data for four metal–TiO2 combinations. These values were obtained by employing a mixture by volume of 90% water–10% EtOH as a standard solution. It is observed that, in agreement with previous publications, combination of titania films with Pt gives the highest hydrogen production rate. It should be noted, however, that the observed ranking in catalytic activity may be influenced by differences in metal loading and/or dispersion, characteristics which have not been determined in the present study. The related study and the optimization of the parameters, which may influence metal deposition (e.g. metal precursor, solution pH, etc.) will be subject of a future investigation."
7,Effect of ethanol concentration,"3.3 Effect of ethanol concentration Fig. 3 shows the rate of hydrogen evolution as a function of irradiation time obtained with the use of Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst and ethanol–water mixtures of various ethanol concentrations. We note that 1% of ethanol is sufficient to give a substantial hydrogen evolution. It is observed that, in all cases, the rate of H2 production increases with irradiation time and goes through a week maximum. Increasing ethanol concentration from 1 to 80% results in an increase of both the initial reaction rate and the rate maximum, which reaches a value of about 5.2μmol/min. Hydrogen was produced also in the absence of water but in that case efficiency dropped. In this respect, it is interesting to study the data of Fig. 4 , showing the value of the maximum H2 evolution rate, which was reached about 150min after the lighting of the light source. In the absence of EtOH, no H2 was detected but it suffices to add a small quantity of ethanol to obtain a substantial rate. As the alcohol percentage increased the maximum hydrogen production rate abruptly increased and then tented to a saturation. This behavior is expected, since the quantity of the catalyst was in all cases limited. Therefore, the active catalyst centers may be saturated. Indeed, when a smaller quantity of catalyst was introduced in the reactor, saturation was obtained at smaller hydrogen production rate. This is seen in the data of Fig. 5 . Finally, in the absence of water, a substantial hydrogen production rate was still possible, where, obviously, reaction (3) is the prime step of the process. The most interesting information provided by Fig. 4 is the fact that while in the absence of ethanol no hydrogen is detected it suffices to add a small quantity of ethanol to rapidly increase hydrogen production rate. This finding results from the fact that ethanol behaves as a sacrificial electron donor scavenging holes and preventing electron-hole recombination. Water itself is a sacrificial hole scavenger, as indicated by Eq. (2). However, it is possible that in that case hydrogen interacts with oxygen and gives a back reaction recreating water. Thus neither hydrogen nor oxygen could be detected in the absence of alcohol, at least by using the present reactor."
8,Effect of the nature of added alcohol,"3.4 Effect of the nature of added alcohol Molecular hydrogen evolution by using the present Pt/TiO2 photocatalytic system can be obtained in the presence of all small-chain aliphatic alcohols. Fig. 6 shows results for solutions of 5vol.% alcohol in water. Ethanol was the most efficient of all studied cases. Surprisingly, methanol was the least efficient. This result is contrary to the common held opinion, which wants methanol as the most efficient among all studied alcohols [11]. However, the large deficiency of methanol compared with the performance of ethanol in Fig. 3 occurs mainly at low alcohol percentage. As seen in Fig. 7 , at higher alcohol percentage the performances of the two alcohols are more compatible."
9,Efficiency calculations,"3.5 Efficiency calculations The hydrogen production rates of both Table 1 and Figs. 3–7, reveal a very efficient photocatalytic alcohol-reforming system. Indeed, the maximum rate of H2 production observed with 80vol.% EtOH was 5.2μmol/min. The quantity of the catalyst used was approximately 0.32g/L (see Section 2). Therefore, the maximum rate was about 16μmol/ming/L. This is a relatively high value compared with the results of previous works (cf., for example, Refs. [12,13,18,21]). Still the importance of the proposed system mainly lies in the fact that the above rates resulted from excitation by a low intensity light source and from optimization of the intensity of incident radiation with respect to the quantity of the exposed to radiation photocatalyst. Most of the works published so far employ strong radiation sources, which emit more light than can be actively absorbed by the photocatalyst. For a proper comparison with the results of other works it is necessary to calculate the quantum yield for the production of molecular hydrogen. A rough estimation of the quantum yield can be obtained by calculating the total number of hydrogen molecules produced in the unit of time and the total number of photons incident on the catalyst in the same time. It should be noted that two electrons are necessary for production of one hydrogen molecule. Thus for a rate of 5.2μmol/min (case of Pt/TiO2/80% ethanol) the total number of effective electrons involved per unit of time was n e =2×5.2×10−6 × N/60electrons/s, where N is the Avogadro's number. Therefore, n e =1.04×1017 electrons/s. Since the average incident power on the catalyst was 78mW (see Section 2), the number of incident photons per unit of time was n p =0.078λ/hc, where λ is the wavelength, h the Planck's constant and c the speed of light. The Black-Light source used in the present work emits light in a single band around 365nm (Fig. 1). Therefore, n p =1.4×1017 photons/s. The irradiance of the photocatalyst was also measured by chemical actinometry and by following the method of Hatchard and Parker [36]. It was found equal to 2.4×1017 photons/s. However, we consider the value based on the electronic measurement as more representative, since it was made at the very position of the photocatalyst while the result of chemical actinometry refers to the total volume of the reactor. It is concluded that the overall quantum efficiency of the above system was φ = n e/n p =74%. This value expresses the total number of effective electrons produced for every 100 photons incident on the photocatalyst. The corresponding quantum yield φ(H2) for molecular hydrogen production was φ/2, i.e. 37%. It is unfortunate that most of the published works do not supply values of φ(H2), therefore, comparison is rather hopeless. It is also useful to estimate the energy conversion efficiency in the above process. Hydrogen combustion (H2 +1/2O2 →H2O) produces 285.8kJ/mol. The amount of energy stored as hydrogen may then be calculated as follows: Energy stored = ( mol of H 2 produced ) × ( Δ H c ) , Δ H c = 285.8 kJ / mol Since we deal with rates of hydrogen production, we may calculate the energy stored per unit of time (power). For the maximum rate of hydrogen production obtained from the 80% EtOH mixture (5.2μmol/min=0.087μmol/s) we obtain: Power ( H 2 ) = 0.087 × 10 − 6 mol H 2 / s × 285.8 × 10 3 J / mol H 2 = 0.025 J / s ( = 0.025 W ) If we compare this value with that of the incident power on the catalyst (78mW), we obtain photon-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency equal to: Conversion efficiency = Stored chemical energy Incident light energy = 25 mW 78 mW = 0.32 ( = 32 % ) Such efficiency values are impressive and underline the importance of making optimal use of the photocatalyst by depositing it in the form of transparent thin films and by exciting it by band-gap excitation. The difference between the quantum yield efficiency for molecular hydrogen, i.e. φ(H2)=37%, and the energy conversion efficiency, i.e. 32%, should not be confused, because they refer to completely different concepts. Thus the maximum expected value for φ(H2) is 50% while the maximum conversion efficiency is 100%."
10,Conclusions,"Transparent nanocrystalline titania films of about 1.3μm thickness, 15nm average nanoparticle size and 110m2/g active surface area have been deposited as thin films on glass slides by the sol–gel process in the presence of surfactant (Triton X-100) templates. Films bearing Pt were used as photocatalysts for alcohol reforming and hydrogen production. Hydrogen evolved with high efficiency by using Black-Light, i.e. band-gap excitation. The quantum yield for active charge carrier generation (i.e. number of active electrons generated over the number of incident photons) reached 74%. Active electrons are considered the electrons reducing hydrogen ions into molecular hydrogen. The corresponding energy conversion efficiency of the system reached 32%. Water–ethanol mixtures were the best substrate for hydrogen production using the above system. In the absence of alcohol, no hydrogen was detected at all. However, it suffices to add a small quantity of ethanol to produce a substantial quantity of hydrogen. Preliminary experiments have shown that the catalyst can be reused in subsequent experiments without substantial loss of efficiency, a fact, which is important for practical applications. Before reuse, it is advantageous if the catalyst is regenerated by heating at 550°C. The efficiency of the present reactor is a result of optimization of the intensity of the incident radiation with respect to the quantity of the active photocatalyst."
