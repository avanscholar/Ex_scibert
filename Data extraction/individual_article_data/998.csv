0,Introduction,"Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting over n-type TiO2 has been reported by Honda and Fujishima in 1972 as a promising strategy towards energy and environmental sustainability. Many efforts have been devoted to designing suitable nanomaterials as photoanode in PEC cell to enhance solar hydrogen production performance [1,2]. Among various metal oxides, predominantly TiO2 have been extensively studied for PEC water splitting due to its unique features such as low cost, nontoxicity, water stability and negative CB position. However, its predominant absorption in the UV region, low electron mobility and high charge recombination rate have negative impact on the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 [3,4]. Several attempts have been made to extend photoresponse of TiO2 to visible light by reducing the bandgap energy through doping with metal and non-metal dopants, coupling with dyes and sensitizing with other semiconductors [5,6]. In recent years, the hybrid/composite of TiO2 and carbon nanomaterials, particularly carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene have attracted more attention. Graphene with an arranged atomic sheet of sp2-bonded carbon atoms has been highlighted as a promising composite material with TiO2 due to its high electronic conductivity and large specific surface area. These unique properties of graphene facilitate charge transportation and separation and increase reaction sites. Furthermore, introducing graphene on the surface of TiO2 extend the light absorption range into visible region due to modification of the energy bandage by carbon [7,8]. Lim et al. [9] reported that incorporation of rGO on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticle as an effective strategy enhance photocurrent response and stability compared to bare TiO2. In another work, Cui et al. [10] investigated the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting over synthesized TiO2 and graphene sheets (GSs) composites by sol-gel method. Hydrogen production rate over this composite was 8.6 μmol/h, almost twice that of P25 (4.5 μmol/h). It is notable to mention that TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) have a high surface to volume ratios, however, their photocatalytic performances have been restricted because of electron trapping centers/scattering at the grain boundaries, low electron motilities (1cm2/Vs), and limitation of photon absorption [1]. One-dimensional (1D) TiO2 photocatalysts are more favorable materials compared to nanoparticles because they are able to facilitate light absorption and scattering [11]. It has been reported that mixed-phase (anatase/rutile) TiO2 has better photocatalytic performance compared to pure TiO2 due to the formation of a heterojunction between rutile and anatase phase and an efficient charge carrier separation [12,13]. Therefore, the phase-dependent photocatalytic capability of TiO2 offers opportunities on developing mixed-phase TiO2 photocatalysts with enhanced activities compared to single-phase TiO2 [14]. Decorating TiO2 with graphene oxide have been extensively studied for the photooxidation process of anatase or rutile phase of TiO2 [15,16]. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no study on the synthesis of bi-phase TiO2 nanorod films with rGO for solar hydrogen production. Herein, we designed a new photoelectrode for photocatalytic hydrogen production by growing TiO2 nanorod on the surface of printed anatase nanoparticle as seeded layer and decorating with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to improve light absorption and charge separation capacity of TiO2. The physicochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of photocatalyst were investigated using different characterization techniques. The photocatalytic hydrogen production of this photocatalyst was compared with pure anatase and rutile phase TiO2 decorated with rGO composites. The stability of the fabricated photoanode was examined for continuous illumination of four days."
1,Experimental,"Tetrabutyl titanate (C16H36O 4 Ti), hydrochloric acid (HCl 37%), ethyl cellulose, (C6H7O2(OH)x(OCH3)y) and α–terpineol (C10H18O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Other materials such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) 20,000 (H(OCH2CH2)nOH), absolute alcohol and acetic acid (CH3COOH), phosphoric acid (H3PO4), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) were obtained from Merck company. All chemicals were analytical grade and used without further purification. Ultrapure water used throughout the experiment was obtained from the Millipore system. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates with the resistance of 15 Ω per square were used for fabrication of photoanode in PEC cell."
2,Fabrication of seeded TiO2 nanorod,"2.1 Fabrication of seeded TiO2 nanorod Fig. 1 displays the schematic diagram of fabrication process of seeded TiO2 Nanorod decorated with rGO (STNR@rGO). First, a screen–printable paste was prepared from a mixture of synthesized TiO2 powder with PEG, ethyl cellulose, α-terpineol, absolute alcohol and acetic acid and then was printed on the conductive side of FTO substrate with a dimension of 3 cm × 2 cm [3]. We have reported the synthesis of TiO2 with the sol-gel via hydrothermal method in our previous works [17,18]. The printing process was repeated five times, following by drying in the belt furnace. To growth TiO2 nanorod (TNR), a mixture of concentrated HCl, deionized (DI) water and tetrabutyl titanate was stirred for 3 h and then transferred to a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave. Afterward, the printed glass was placed into the solution with the conducting side faced downward. The autoclave was sealed and the reaction was carried out at 150 °C for 12 h. The sample then was washed with DI water and dried in the room temperature."
3,Fabrication of seeded TiO2 nanorod@RGO,"2.2 Fabrication of seeded TiO2 nanorod@RGO Graphene oxide was synthesized by modified Hummer's method from graphite powder. In summary, graphite powder was added into a mixture of H2SO4 and H3PO4 in the ice bath under vigorous stirring and then KMnO4 was added and stirred for 6 h until it became dark green. The excess KMnO4 was removed by adding H2O2 and stirred for 10 min. The prepared solution was stirred at 40 °C overnight and followed by adding HCl and DI water and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 30 min and then was dried in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h to get powder GO. The exact amount of GO was dispersed in DI water (concentration of 0.2 mg/ mL) in the bath ultrasonic for 30 min and deposited on the seeded TiO2 Nanorod using spin coating technique (1200 rpm for 15 s) for two times [19]. The prepared samples were placed in the tube furnace and calcined under argon gas at 400 °C for 1 h and labeled STNR@rGO. A small strip of conductive silver ink as ohmic contact was printed on the top of photoanode, sintered in the belt furnace, soldered with a copper wire, and covered with epoxy resin. Furthermore, the photocatalytic performance of STNR@rGO was compared with TNR@rGO and TiO2 Nanoparitcle@rGO (TNP@rGO) photoanodes."
4,Physicochemical characterization,"2.3 Physicochemical characterization The composition and crystal structure of the samples were determined using X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (Bruker D8 Advance instrument). Raman spectra were recorded using Horiba Jobin Yvon HR800 with 514 nm laser light and 100× objective lens. The surface morphology and micrographs were observed with a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) using Zeiss Supra 55VP equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained by Zeiss Libra 200 with accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Thermo-scientific K-Alpha with standard calibration of copper, silver and gold under high ultra-vacuum (2 × 10−7 Torr) was used to record X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The optical properties of photocatalysts were investigated using Cary100 spectrophotometer and calibrated with Spectralon 99% reflectance standard over the wavelength range from 200 to 800 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Horiba. LabRam HR Evolution) with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm."
5,Photoelectrochemical measurement,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurement The PEC cell components include the fabricated photoanodes (STNR@rGO, TNR@rGO, TNP@rGO, TNR and TNP), a platinum (Pt) rod, and an Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) electrode as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. All electrodes are immersed in a mixture of 1.0 M KOH (pH = 13.6) and 5 vol% glycerol. The photoanode of PEC cell was connected to a fabricated dye-sensitized solar cell (0.7 V) to provide sufficient voltage for water splitting (supplementary information, Fig. S1) [19]. The photocatalytic reaction was conducted under a 500 W halogen lamp with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G). The produced hydrogen was collected around Pt electrode in a reversed burette. The gaseous products were analyzed using Multiple Gas Analyzer software (SRI Instruments 8610-0071) [20,21]. The photoelectrochemical properties were studied using Autolab potentiostat PGSTAT302N (Metrohm, Switzerland) with a conventional three-electrode configuration. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed in the range of 0.1 Hz to 100 KHz and AC amplitude of 10 mV using Z-Plot/Z-View to control instrument operation and data acquisition. The photocurrent density (I–V) was measured with linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) procedure for data acquisition at potential from −0.5 to 1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl with the scan rate of 20 mV s−1 [21]."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Structure and morphology,"3.1 Structure and morphology Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of samples to identify the structure of the prepared photocatalysts. Different XRD peaks for TiO2 nanoparticles (TNP) and nanorod (TNR) are in good agreement with those of anatase (JCPDS, No. 01-089-4921) and rutile TiO2 (JCPDS, No. 098-020-2241), respectively. Furthermore, the XRD patterns of TNP@rGO (JCPDS, No.01-075-2546) TNR@rGO (JCPDS, No. 98-006-2679) and STNR@rGO (JCPDS for anatase, No. 98-008-2084 and JCPDS for rutile, No. 98-020-2240) composites exhibited diffraction peaks only ascribed to anatase and rutile peaks of TiO2. It is also observed that no corresponding characteristics peaks were found for rGO in the XRD patterns, which can be explained by its low diffraction pattern intensity [18]. Therefore, Raman spectra of samples were acquired to analyze the heterostructure phases. Fig. 3(a) reveals the structural information from Raman spectroscopy of STNR@rGO, TNR@rGO, TNP@rGO, TNP, and TNR. The TNR film displays two distinct peaks at 442 cm−1 (Eg) and 607 cm−1(A1g) corresponding to the active mode of rutile phase. In addition, another characteristic broad compound vibrational peak at 230 cm−1 aroused from the multiple phonon scattering processes [22]. The Raman active modes of anatase TiO2 for TNP with symmetries of B1g, A1g + B1g and Eg were observed at about 390, 512, and 635 cm−1, respectively [21]. Furthermore, anatase and rutile phase of TiO2 slightly had red shifted by introducing rGO on the surface of TNP and TNR, suggesting that rGO can be successfully introduced on the surface of TiO2 via spin-coating technique and following heat treatment. The rGO exhibits two peaks, D band at 1350 cm−1 and G band at 1599 cm−1 as shown in Fig. 3(b). Fig. 3(c) reveals that the combination of rGO and TiO2 shifts the position of D and G bands to higher wavelength compared to rGO as Tabulated in Table S1(supplementary information), attributing to the strong interfacial interaction between rGO nanosheets and TiO2 [22]. Fig. 4(a–c) and (d–e) show FESEM images of the top and cross-sectional views of rGO decorated on the surface of TNP, TNR and STNR composites, respectively. The FSEM images of printed TNP thin film on the surface of FTO substrate display the highly porous film with a thickness of 1.8 μm. The insets of Fig. 4(b, c) reveal that the top facades of the rods are square, corresponding to the growth habit of tetragonal crystals [23]. The cross-sectional views (Fig. 4(d, e)) demonstrate that the pre-deposition of TiO2 seed layer on FTO substrate could promote the epitaxial nucleation and growth orientation of the TiO2 nanorod. Furthermore, introducing seed layer can reduce the diameter of the nanorod and increase the density of nanorod with more reaction sites [24]. The morphology and crystal structure of the rGO decorated on TNP, TNR and STNR were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). Fig. 5(a) shows that TNPs consist of single crystalline with clear lattice fringes of 0.24 and 0.35 nm (inset of Fig. 5(a)), corresponding to the (101) and (103) plans of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS, No. 01–089-4921) [25]. Fig. 5(b) illustrates the TEM image of STNR@rGO, which particle-like and rod-like TiO2 are anchored on the rGO layer. The two lattice fringes with the interplanar distance of 0.33 and 0.22 nm relate to the (110) and (020) planes of rutile TiO2 crystal (JCPDS, No. 98-020-2240). The results validate the incorporation of the rGO nanosheets with TiO2 rods and particles. Furthermore, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping was applied to study the distribution of elements of STNR@rGO as shown in Fig. 5(c–d), confirming Ti, O, and C were well dispersed within the composite."
8,Surface chemical properties,"3.2 Surface chemical properties The chemical features of the STNR@rGO, TNP, and TNR films were analyzed by XPS as shown in Fig. 6(a–c). Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 peaks for Ti4+ were identified at 459.03 and 464.68 eV for anatase TiO2 in TNP and 458.88 and 464.68 eV for rutile TiO2 in TNR, respectively [23]. It should be noted that Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 peaks at 458.50 and 464.29 eV for STNR shift to 458.81 and 464.58 eV in STNR@rGO composite, respectively. The main XPS spectra of O1s (Fig. 6 (b)) for TNP and TNR were identified about 530 eV, ascribing the presence of oxygen lattice in the metal oxide (TiO) and the peak around 532 eV confirms the presence of absorbed –OH on the surface of TiO2. Fig. 6(c) displays that XPS peaks of C 1s in STNR@rGO composite are located at 284.80, 286.49 and 288.51 eV, corresponding to the C-C/C=C, CO and overlapping of O-C=O and Ti-O-C, respectively. Moreover, the band at 283.57 eV was assigned to the presence of the TiC bond as a result of interaction between TiO2 and rGO [7,24]. This interaction leads to the creation of an electron transfer channel which is more favorable to improve the photoexcited charge separation process during the photocatalytic reaction [25–27]."
9,Optical properties,"3.3 Optical properties The absorbance spectra of TNP, TNR and TNP@rGO, TNR@rGO and STNR@rGO are shown in Fig. 7(a). These spectra reveal that maximum absorbance in the UV region with a wavelength below 400 nm is consistent of the intrinsic bandgap absorption of TiO2. The measured bandgap energies (Fig. 7 (b)) for TNP, TNR and TNP@rGO, TNR@rGO and STNR@rGO were 3.20, 3.10, 3.11, 3.00 and 2.9 eV, respectively. The band-gap of the films gradually decreases by adding rGO due to the formation of the Ti-O-C bond as supported by the XPS spectra. The UV–vis absorption spectra of decorated rGO on the surface of TiO2 had a redshift of absorbance edges about 20 nm compared to TNP and TNR photocatalysts, which is attributed to the narrowing of the bandgap by the chemical bonding between TiO2 and rGO [26]. Furthermore, the absorbance of TNR@rGO, including pure rutile phase TiO2 has greater value than seeded layer TiO2 (rutile and anatase phase) in STNR@rGO composite, which illustrates that light trapping of TiO2 nanorod is better than seed layers [28]. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra have been extensively utilized to investigate the efficiency of the charge carrier trapping, migration and transfer [29]. The PL signal is a result of recombination of photo-induced carriers due to the reverse radiative deactivation from the excited state of TiO2 as illustrated in Fig. 7(c). TNP showed the broad and intense PL band than the TNR due to fast charge recombination rate. The peaks between 400 and 600 nm can be ascribed to the self-trapped excitons and the oxygen vacancies (VO) in TiO2 [6]. The presence of rGO on the surface of TiO2 exhibited a decrease in emission intensity of TiO2, representing the rapid electron transfers from TiO2 to rGO [25]. In addition, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra (Fig. S4) confirm that the faster decay lifetime (τ1) of rGO composites lead to the enhanced their photocatalytic properties due to facilitating charge carrier transfer and increasing the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs. Furthermore, a weak emission intensity of STNR@rGO composite (Fig. 7(c)) and it fasters decay lifetime (τ1 ~0.17) compared to others suggesting that the anatase/rutile phase junction could lead to effective charge transfer from anatase to rutile was the main pathway in the presence of rGO as the electron mediator, leading to the enhanced photocatalytic properties [14,30,31]."
10,Photoelectrochemical properties,"3.4 Photoelectrochemical properties The Nyquist plots of TNP, TNR and STNR decorated with rGO are shown in Fig. 8(a). The proper equivalent circuit for samples is [R (RQ)(RQ)] (Supporting Information, Fig. S2). The first RQ explains the electron transfer resistance and the tendency of recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface in the higher frequency [32–34]. Rs is sheet resistance, Rct is charge transfer resistance and CPEsc is double layer capacitance for photoanodes. While the second RQ related to charge–transfer resistance (RCE) and double layer capacitance (CPECE) in the interface of the counter electrode (Pt). The fitting results (Table S2) show that the radii of the semicircle of STNR@rGO is smaller than other composites due to lower Rct (121.71 Ω) with electron lifetime (τn = Rct × CPE) of 14.33 ms which was longer than TNR@rGO (Rct: 185.35 Ω, τ: 6.7 ms) and TNP@rGO (Rct: 347.66 Ω, τ: 1.94 ms) composites. These results suggest faster charge carrier mobility and more effective electron-hole pair separation. Fig. 8(b) reveals that TiO2 nanorod on the seed layers showed larger photocurrent density than others. The presence of titania (110) plane with a high interface energy on the seed layers causes a facile adsorption of electroactive species in the electrolyte, resulting in increased active redox reactions on these surfaces under light irradiation [35]. Furthermore, the better performance of decorated TiO2 with reduced rGO explain that rGO significantly facilitates the transfer of electron-hole pairs and reduce the recombination rate of charge carrier as confirmed by PL and EIS results."
11,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The hydrogen production was investigated by connecting the PEC cell in series to the fabricated dye-sensitized solar cell to provide sufficient bias of 0.7 V and the produced hydrogen was collected in the reverses burette around the counter electrode (Pt). As plotted in Fig. 9(a), it is clearly seen that STNR@rGO photocatalyst express the highest yield of hydrogen after 2 h. In addition, a sharp decrease of hydrogen production is observed for TNR and TNP in the absence of rGO. The maximum produced hydrogen over STNR@rGO was1205 mmol/cm2, which is about 7.5 and 20 times higher than that of TNR (159 mmol/cm2) and TNP (58 mmol/cm2), respectively (Fig. 9(b)). Furthermore, the low amount of produced hydrogen over TNP is related to high charge transfer resistance and recombination rate due to the large number of trap states at grain boundaries [36]. The better photocatalytic performance of STNR@rGO relates to the hybrid electrode design of anatase NPs with high surface area ensure that the adequate electrolyte contact with the surface of the photocatalyst. While the incorporated TiO2 NRs can serve as not only a light-scattering layer for light harvest but also electron-transport pathways that prevent the recombination of photoelectrons. Furthermore, the co-existence of anatase/rutile causes a better charge carrier separation and a decrease in the recombination rate as confirmed by PL, EIS and I-V characteristics. The band structure of anatase for TNP@rGO, rutile for TNR@rGO and STNR@rGO are investigated by XPS valence band (VB) spectra as shown in Fig. S3. The VB minimum for anatase and rutile are determined to be 2.7 and 2.8 eV, respectively. Since the work function of XPS instrument is 4.62 eV, the VB potential for anatase and rutile are calculated to be 2.82 V and 2.92 V (vs. SHE, provided 4.5 eV vs. vacuum level is 0 V vs. SHE), respectively. The conduction band (CB) of anatase and rutile is calculated −0.29 and − 0.08 V by using aforementioned band gap energy, respectively. Hence, the alignment of energy levels can be drawn as shown in Fig. 10 [37–39]. The presence of reduced graphene oxide on the surface of photoanode improve the photocatalytic activity and photoelectrochemical characteristics compared to pure TiO2 nanorod and nanoparticles. rGO served as an electron collector and transporter, separating effectively the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. This in turn lengthened the lifetime of the charge carriers, which could be advantageous for improving the photocatalytic performance [40]. Fig. 11 depicts the stability of STNR@rGO composite catalyst without clear deactivation during repeated utilization."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, the hierarchically modified seeded TiO2 nanorod with rGO was synthesized using screen-printing, hydrothermal and spin coating techniques. The physicochemical and photoelectrochemical properties and hydrogen production of this composite were investigated and compared with TNR, TNP, and their modified composites with rGO. Incorporation of rGO with TiO2 expanded the light absorption, enhanced the photocurrent density and reduced charge carrier recombination rate compared to pure anatase and rutile TiO2. In addition, the bi-phase modified TiO2 nanorod decorated with rGO shows higher photocurrent density, less charge transfer resistance and recombination rate and longer electron lifetime compared to other composites as confirmed by characterization results. The hybrid electrode design is beneficial to enhance hydrogen production and photoelectrochemical properties. This hybrid photocatalyst can be modified by varying other parameters such as the thickness of seeded layers and rGO concertation for future development of solar-powered hydrogen generation."
