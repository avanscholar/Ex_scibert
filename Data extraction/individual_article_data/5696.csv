0,Introduction,"Thermochemical water-splitting cycles (TWSCs) represent an appealing carbon-free option for hydrogen production powered by alternative (carbon-free) energy sources. Until today, hundreds of TWSCs have been conceived and evaluated, but only a limited number reached higher development and demonstration level. These include the hybrid sulfur [1,2] and the sulfur–iodine (SI) cycles [3,4], belonging to the so-called “sulfur family” because they involve the vaporization of liquid and concentrated sulfuric acid and subsequent decomposition to sulfur dioxide and oxygen: (1) H2SO4 →H2O+SO3 (H2SO4 vaporization, ∼400°C) (2) SO3 →SO2 +½O2 (SO3 splitting, >750°C) The feasibility of both processes has been demonstrated by bench-scale closed cycle operation [5,6]. Hence, current actions are mainly focused on the technological advancement, including the selection and development of scalable materials and key components needed for large scale demonstration. The endothermic catalytic reduction of sulfur trioxide into sulfur dioxide and oxygen is the high-temperature step common to all sulfur-based thermochemical cycles. Its coupling with a C-free heat source, either solar or nuclear, can be directly achieved in a solar reactor fed by concentrated solar radiation, or indirectly by means of a heat-exchanger/decomposer reactor using a suitable heat transfer fluid. Different concepts to bring in either high-temperature solar or nuclear heat into the endothermic chemical process above have been conceived and comparatively evaluated [7]. Those concepts differ with respect to the way the chemical process is coupled with the energy source. The concepts of a volumetric receiver–reactor for the solar process and a heat-exchanger reactor for nuclear heat have been identified as the only two that are feasible for the high-temperature decomposition of sulfuric acid. However, these two kinds of reactors have different operating conditions in terms of pressure (the solar reactor operates at atmospheric pressure, whereas the heat-exchanger reactor requires pressures as high as 9bar mainly to minimize reactor volume) and employ the catalyst structure in different forms (coated on honeycombs and in the form of pellets, respectively). Moreover, when the process is powered by a high-temperature gas cooled nuclear reactor decomposition temperatures must be limited below the helium coolant temperature of ca. 900°C. Also in the solar case it is reasonable to reduce the SO3 splitting temperatures, if one takes into consideration that the solar receiver efficiency increases at lower temperatures due to reduced reradiation [8] and that photolytic effect by direct solar radiation can be considered negligible in comparison to thermal decomposition; this last statement can be noticed, for instance, by comparing some relevant published results [9,10]. The major challenges of sulfur-based thermochemical cycles are the high temperatures and corrosive environments present in their key steps. The conditions require not only advanced materials for the key components but also special components design and fabrication methods. The relevant materials for decomposition of H2SO4 should maintain appropriate conditions for the chemical reaction at temperatures higher than 850°C, be corrosion and thermal shock resistant, exhibit high fracture and creep strength maintained in this temperature range and last but not least be inexpensive and preferably fabricated in net-shape design. Promising material candidates for the decomposition section cover nickel-based alloys, high-temperature ferritic steels, as well as carbon and SiC composites (disregarding very expensive noble metals). Studies in the US [11–13] identified the SiC family as one of the most promising candidates for this application. SiC obtains its corrosion stability through the formation of a stable surface silica layer. Indeed, its exceptional thermal conductivity (170W/m/K at room temperature), its refractoriness (up to 1600°C under air) and its resistance to corrosive environment contribute to the consideration of this material as a favored candidate for high-temperature heat-exchanger concepts. In fact, several of the authors of the present work have introduced the concept of solar honeycomb monolithic reactors with the catalytic material coated on the walls of multi-channeled honeycomb ceramic supports made of SiC capable of absorbing concentrated solar irradiation [14], to perform successfully solar-aided endothermic reactions such as water splitting for the production of hydrogen [15,16]. Similarly, SiC was found perfectly suitable as the material of choice for a solar absorber/receiver/reactor for the performance of H2SO4 decomposition [7]. This is due to the combination of the above mentioned chemical resistance and thermo-mechanical properties plus its excellent optical properties (high absorbance for radiation). In order to minimize materials cost, a satisfactory reaction rate in the sulfur trioxide splitting is needed. This can be ensured only by the use of dedicated catalyst systems featured by a high catalytic activity, high stability, immobility of catalyst materials under the harsh conditions applied, and an acceptable price. Hence, for an effective design and operation of a sulfuric acid decomposition reactor, it is necessary to assess the stability and endurance of the catalyst structures under the harsh reaction environment as well as to derive reliable SO3 decomposition kinetic models under realistic operation conditions. The use of suitable catalysts (i.e. active, stable, and cost effective) will allow for lower operating temperatures: in fact, in absence of suitable catalysts, high SO3 conversion and satisfactory reaction rates can be detected only at temperatures above 900°C [10,17]. As a result, smaller reactor sizes and lower material costs can be reached using suitable catalysts. Literature data on catalytic SO3 decomposition [18–22] show that iron(III) oxide and mixed oxides based on that can be considered among the best catalyst options at temperatures equal or above 850°C, because of its catalytic activity, stability and low cost. In contrast, at temperatures below 850°C more complex/expensive materials must be used, such as supported platinum [20,22]. Part 1 of this work [23] addresses exactly the synthesis and evaluation of such iron oxide-based alternative catalytic materials such as spinels (AB2O4) or perovskites (ABO3). It is also reported that chromium(III) oxide shows satisfactory activity, but it is also mentioned that material leaching is observed during its exposure to the reaction conditions [20,24]. Therefore, a non-precious metal oxide like iron(III) oxide represents a first inexpensive fall back option for large scale decomposer design. Thus, the study presented in this paper is focused on this material. However, it is noteworthy that most relevant studies published in the open literature refer to the SO3 splitting diluted in inert gas carrier and using fine catalyst powder [10,20,25,26]. Based on the above, the present work concerns evaluation and performance tests of Fe2O3-based catalysts, either supported on siliconised silicon carbide (abbreviation hereafter: SiSiC) or as bulk pellets under process conditions close to the real working conditions for a full-scale decomposer. For this reason, the feed chosen for the investigation is concentrated (>90wt%) sulfuric acid and the amount of carrier gas is strongly limited. The work involved the coating of Fe2O3 on SiSiC honeycomb fragments and the assessment of the supported materials’ stability (in the form of fragments) in prolonged exposure to the reaction environment by 100h catalytic testing of these structured catalysts. In addition, despite several studies on thermo-catalytic SO3 splitting, no detailed kinetic law has been provided to date; hence, thorough parametric study with the Fe2O3 material was undertaken, to evaluate the effects of reaction temperature, SO3 partial pressure, and Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) on the SO3 conversion and decomposition rate. The WHSV is defined as the mass flow rate of inlet sulfuric acid per unit catalyst mass, calculated by the following equation: (3) WHSV = F H 2 SO 4 in W cat ( h − 1 ) where F H 2 SO 4 in is the mass flow of the liquid sulfuric acid feedstock, in g/h, while W cat is the mass of catalyst used. The results have been employed for the extraction of an empirical kinetic law suitable for an efficient heat-exchanger/decomposer reactor design and prototype design and development."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation For the 100h catalyst durability tests, Fe2O3-coated SiSiC honeycombs were employed. The iron(III) oxide powder is a typical commercial one with a measured BET of 5.79m2/g and an average particle diameter of 0.5μm. The SiSiC honeycombs used as supports were of the flow-through type, cylindrical, 2.54mm diameter×2.54mm length with a channel density of 300cpsi (channels per square inch), having almost zero porosity (0.016%) as determined with the aid of mercury porosimetry (Quantachrome, AUTOSCAN 200 porosimeter). An aqueous slurry of the Fe2O3 powder was prepared with solids content of 40wt%. A sodium salt of an acrylic polymer (commercial name Dispex® A40, Ciba Specialty Chemicals Inc, Basle Switzerland) was used as dispersant for slurry stabilization. Subsequently, the SiSiC honeycombs were impregnated in the slurry under stirring for one minute. The loaded specimens were withdrawn and excess slurry was removed by blowing air through the honeycomb channels. Then the specimens were dried at 110°C overnight. This procedure was repeated several times in order to achieve a satisfactory amount of catalyst deposited on the support. Finally the coated specimens were calcined at 900°C for 4h to ensure efficient adhesion of the catalyst powder upon the substrate. The calcination temperature was selected with the rationale that, since the catalytic stability tests are performed at temperatures up to 900°C, the catalyst powders have to be calcined at least at this temperature to ensure that all physicochemical transformations that occur during heating to that temperature have already taken place before the actual catalytic tests. Loading percentage was determined from the increase of specimen weight after calcination. A total of five coated honeycombs were prepared with catalyst (Fe2O3) loadings in the range of 14.9–18.5wt%. For the kinetic experiments, since the “as-received” Fe2O3 powder was very fine, “coarser” catalytic specimens had to be prepared to avoid significant pressure drop in the catalytic test rig (described in detail below). Two kinds of such catalytic specimens have been prepared based on the two reactor configurations (solar receiver and heat exchanger) that are going to implement the SO3 dissociation reaction in large scale. Since the solar reactor is based on redox-material-coated SiSiC honeycombs, the first set of these specimens involved such Fe2O3-coated SiSiC honeycombs that were prepared according to the aforementioned procedure (Fig. 1a and b) and subsequently crushed. The fragments (Fig. 1c) were sieved to two size distribution sets: one in the range of 1–20mm, and one in the range of 1–5mm. Atmospheric pressure experiments were performed with both sets of fragments, whereas high-pressure experiments were conducted only with the second set. The second type of catalytic specimens prepared involved coarse fragments of Fe2O3 pellets; this type corresponds to the heat-exchanger/decomposer reactor configuration where the catalytic material is employed in the form of pellets. For the preparation of the pellets, the aforementioned Fe2O3 powder was mixed with the proper amount of poly-vinyl-alcohol (PVA) binder and shaped in a uniaxial hydraulic press. Twenty-four pellets were prepared, which were subsequently fired under air at 900°C for 4h for the reason explained above. The pellets after calcination were approximately 10mm diameter×10mm length (Fig. 1d). For the catalytic tests, the Fe2O3 cylindrical pellets were crushed and sieved to obtain fragments with particle size in the range of 2–6mm (average diameter 3.7mm) and 1–2mm. The first set of coarser size was employed for experiments at atmospheric pressure, whereas the second set was used in both atmospheric and at higher pressure experiments."
3,Sulfuric acid decomposition tests,"2.2 Sulfuric acid decomposition tests H2SO4 decomposition over Fe2O3-based catalysts was investigated and evaluated in dedicated test-rigs, customized to evaluate the different catalysts formulations in terms of activity and stability. All adopted test-rigs (Fig. 2 ) consisted of a pump for the liquid feedstock, i.e. 90–96wt% H2SO4, a quartz tube placed into a temperature-controlled electrical oven, and at least one of the following devices to analyze the oxygen and/or SO2 output rates: • trapping of SO2 in a Bunsen trap followed by titration of the remaining I2 with sodium-thiosulfate; • detection of the O2 concentration; • UV–VIS analyzers for SO2 detection; • gas chromatography to measure O2 concentration after SO2 removal in a H2O2 trap • measurement of the outlet O2 flow rate by flow meters (both a digital mass flow meter and a bubble flow meter) after SO2 removal in a H2O2 trap. If not otherwise stated, the catalyst was placed between two quartz wool beds. Some experiments were carried out in the presence of a small flow of nitrogen as inert carrier gas in order to either enhance liquid feed vaporization or for analytical purpose; in the latter case, nitrogen was alternatively mixed with the product gas mixture exiting the reactor."
4,Catalyst post-characterization,"2.3 Catalyst post-characterization Both the as-prepared and the exposed (the latter from now on to be denoted as “spent” samples) coated and uncoated SiSiC monoliths were analyzed by X-Ray Diffraction analysis – XRD – (Siemens D-500 Kristalloflex X-ray powder diffractometer; Cu Ka radiation), Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy – SEM/EDS - (JEOL – 6300 microscope), and Thermogravimetric Analysis – TGA (Perkin Elmer Pyris-6 instrument). All TGA were performed under air and temperature was increased from ambient to 1000°C at a heating rate of 5°C/min."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst durability tests,"3.1 Catalyst durability tests Catalyst stability is a fundamental constraint for a potential industrial breakthrough of the sulfur-based thermochemical cycles technology in the near to mid-term future. Accelerated stability experiments on several metal oxides SO3 splitting catalysts have been performed by Ginosar et al. [27], showing a possible decline of catalytic activity with time due to several effects like sintering, leaching, phase changes, etc. However, there are only few published data in the literature about SO3 splitting catalyst durability after relatively prolonged exposure on stream. In case of SiSiC-coated with metal oxides, catalyst detachment from the support is also a possibility that should be considered. Hence, after establishment of the catalytic activity, catalyst stability after 100h-long exposure to decomposition conditions was assessed. These 100h tests were performed with honeycombs coated with commercial Fe2O3 as well as with non-coated SiSiC honeycombs under the operating conditions reported in Table 1 . Based on the amount of catalyst on each coated honeycomb the respective weight hourly space velocities (WHSV) were calculated following eq. (3) and are also reported in Table 1. The results are shown in Fig. 3a and b respectively. First, it can be stated that for both samples the outputs of the two measuring methods (Bunsen trap followed by I2 titration and O2 detector) correlate well. A very high initial conversion (quite close to the thermodynamic maximum value of 88%) was achieved with sample No. 1. Its activity, however, showed a moderate decrease over time: it dropped by more than 10 percentage points after approximately 30h of exposure time, while it seemed to have stabilized at a SO3 conversion value of about 75% after approximately 70 operational hours. On the other hand, sample No. 2 started at a lower initial conversion of about 80% and showed no significant decrease of activity during the test period. It should be noted that the profound difference between the SO3 conversion as measured in this experiment and the one presented in the initial activity measurements reported in Part 1 of the work [23], is attributed to the substantially lower WHSV employed here (i.e. 6.0h−1 as compared to the 50–52h−1 of the respective initial activity test), the different reactor configurations between the two cases (i.e. fixed bed vs. coated honeycomb) as well as to the fact that SO3 concentration utilized in these specific experiments is lower (due to N2 carrier gas utilization and due to the slightly lower sulfuric acid concentration, i.e. 90wt% vs. 96wt%), thus favoring somewhat higher conversion values. In addition, qualification of two uncoated reference SiSiC samples has been performed for 100 operational hours each, obtaining relatively low conversion of SO3 (<20%), as shown in Fig. 3c and d. It is noticeable that the activity of the material was quite high (exceeding 20%) during the first 5h of exposure, but subsequently (after about 20h of exposure) decreased and stabilized to values below 10%. The relatively high initial conversion is probably attributed to an initial oxidation period of free Si at the SiSiC surface by SO3, during which SiO2 and SO2 are formed. The non-negligible “plateau” conversion is probably due to catalytically active impurities (e.g. iron) on the surface of the samples (identified via SEM/EDS). This transitory “start-up effect” has been observed in other preliminary tests carried out with the uncoated SiSiC fragments at 900°C and 1atm, feeding sulfuric acid (96wt%) with a flow rate corresponding to WHSV=20h−1, and using nitrogen as carrier gas. After vaporization, an SO3 partial pressure of about 0.35atm was obtained measuring about 6–9% SO3 conversion. In this test, a high SO2 production was initially observed without a measurable O2 production rate (Fig. 4 ). It can thus be concluded that SiSiC acts as an oxygen getter, reacting with SO3 at the high operating temperatures (900°C) and producing SO2 and SiO2. The 100h exposed monoliths were subjected to XRD, SEM/EDS and TGA analyses. Typical SEM pictures, TGA and XRD results of spent samples are shown in Fig. 5 . The main findings of the post-characterization procedure are summarized in Table 2 . SEM/EDS analyses revealed that free Si of the substrate is subjected to a limited oxidation by SOx species (Fig. 5a); this is further corroborated from the respective small XRD peaks (Fig. 5c) corresponding to quartz (at diffraction angles of 20.85 and 26.65 degrees) as well as from the respective TGA curves (Fig. 5d) corresponding to the two non-coated SiSiC spent monoliths that show a slight weight increase of the samples at temperatures above ≈600°C. SEM/EDS analyses have also identified the presence of residual sulfates in both Fe2O3-coated monoliths (Fig. 5b), an effect also observed after the initial activity tests on iron oxide powders in Part 1 of the work. This is again further supported from the respective TGA curves corresponding to the two Fe2O3-coated monoliths (Fig. 5c) and their comparison to the respective curve of commercial Fe2(SO4)3 ∗ 7H2O powder sample also shown that strongly suggests that the weight loss of the coated samples can safely be attributed to residual sulfates decomposition. These residual sulfates are present in minor quantities as indicated by both their absence from the respective XRD patterns and the small weight loss measured by TGA post-analysis (Table 2). On the other hand, the identification of such species is a proof that the reaction proceeds via the formation of intermediate sulfate species, as already documented in Part 1 of the work."
7,Experimental parametric study,"3.2 Experimental parametric study Since Fe2O3 has promising features for final application as catalyst coating for SO3 splitting due to its satisfactory activity and stability, an experimental parametric study was undertaken with Fe2O3 fragmented pellets and Fe2O3-coated SiSiC honeycomb fragments, under operating conditions similar to the real design conditions for the two different decomposer concepts (solar receiver or heat exchanger/decomposer). Hence, concentrated sulfuric acid (ca. 96wt%) liquid mixture was fed to the decomposer tube operated in the temperature/pressure range of 775–900°C/1–4bar to investigate the effect of relevant reaction parameters (i.e. temperature and WSHV) on the final SO3-to-SO2 conversion. The operating conditions are summarized in Table 3 . Samples of both Fe2O3 fragmented pellets and Fe2O3-coated SiSiC fragments were tested in two different experimental campaigns, here referred to as No. 1 and No. 2 tests: • No. 1 tests: catalyst samples (both Fe2O3 fragmented pellets and Fe2O3-coated SiSiC fragments) with coarser particle size were used, and SO3 conversion was measured by detection of the outlet O2 concentration (in mixture with N2) by gas chromatography after SO2 removal in a H2O2 trap; • No. 2 tests: catalyst samples (both Fe2O3 fragmented pellets and Fe2O3-coated SiSiC fragments) with finer particle sizes were used, while SO3 conversion was determined by the outlet O2 flow rate measurement after SO2 removal in a H2O2 trap. The experimental apparatus used for No. 2 tests was designed to operate at pressures up to 7bar, controlling the pressure by means of a back pressure regulation valve set between the H2SO4/H2O condenser and the SO2 trap (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that in the high-pressure experiments no inert carrier gas (nitrogen) was injected in the decomposer, as there is lack of experimental data on H2SO4 decomposition under such “gas carrier free” conditions (a recent publication from Ginosar et al. [27] is one of few examples) and with SO3 partial pressure exceeding 0.5bar. 3.2.1 Fe2O3 pellet fragments The effect of temperature and space velocity on the obtained SO3 conversion is summarized in Table 4 ; the experimental values are compared to the thermodynamic equilibrium ones as calculated with the AspenPlus simulator. In Table 5 , the results obtained at pressures up to 4bars are reported. In this latter case 15g of 1–2mm Fe2O3 pellets were introduced inside the reactor tube in the form of a packed bed with an apparent density of 2.42g/cm3 (length×diameter=65mm×11mm). Results in Tables 4 and 5 show that this catalyst requires weight hourly space velocities lower than 10.0h−1 in order to obtain SO3 conversion values higher than 50% at 850°C and SO3 partial pressure below 1bar; moreover, comparison between Tables 4 and 5 suggests that conversion is sensibly affected by catalyst particle size: smaller particles lead to higher conversion probably due to the higher active surface. Post-characterization by SEM/EDS evidenced the presence of a small amount of sulfur (of the order of 1.0wt%) on the surface of the spent material while the small weight decrease observed in the relevant TGA analysis is within the typical range of iron sulfate species decomposition (570–700°C). These observations are in agreement with the findings discussed in the previous section. Additionally, BET analysis showed a specific area decrease from 5.32m2/g (fresh sample) to 2.75m2/g (spent sample) after more than 100h exposure to the reaction environment. Since similar post-characterization results were reported in Part 1 of the work [23] for the respective Fe2O3 powder fixed bed reactor after 45–60min exposure, it can be safely assumed that a significant surface area reduction occurs within short time after reactor start up, with the surface area remaining stable afterwards. 3.2.2 Fe2O3-coated SiSiC fragments Respective tests were carried out with the Fe2O3-coated SiSiC fragments (about 18.5wt% iron(III) oxide loading). The effect of temperature and space velocity on SO3 conversion is summarized in Table 6 for fragments of size between 1 and 20mm. In Table 7 , the results obtained with fragments of size between 1 and 5mm at pressures of up to 4bars are reported. Similarly to the Fe2O3 pellet fragments, results in Tables 6 and 7 show that Fe2O3-coated SiSiC catalyst requires weight hourly space velocities lower than 15.0h−1 in order to obtain SO3 conversion values higher than 50% at 850°C and that conversion is sensibly affected by catalyst particle size."
8,Reactor sizing,"3.3 Reactor sizing The design and sizing of the SO3 decomposer requires a suitable kinetic model, empirically obtained under representative experimental conditions close to the real reactor conditions, i.e. with catalyst systems and operating conditions similar to those predicted for the full-scale unit. By performing tests at different values of temperature and space velocity (WHSV, h−1), it was possible to determine a suitable equation for sizing the fixed bed reactor, both in the case of the Fe2O3 pellet fragments as well as of the Fe2O3-coated SiSiC fragments. Results represented in Tables 5 and 7 suggest that, within the experimental error (±2% on SO3 percentage conversion value) pressure has a negligible effect on SO3 conversion and decomposition rate within the operational range of 775–875°C, 1–4bar, and a WHSV high enough to neglect the reverse reaction (i.e. equilibrium) effects. However, a first-order kinetics for SO3 splitting over metal oxide catalysts has been previously verified [20,25]. Assuming a plug-flow reactor with a fixed catalyst bed operating at steady-state conditions, the reactor equation can be expressed as follows: (4) F SO 3 0 · ⅆ X = ( r ) · ⅆ z · A sc where F SO 3 0 is the inlet SO3 flow rate (mol/sec), X is the SO3 fractional conversion, (r) is the SO3 dissociation reaction rate, z is the reactor axial dimension, and A sc is the reactor cross sectional area. Under the above mentioned assumption of a first-order kinetic law, the SO3 dissociation reaction rate can be written as: (5) ( r ) = k c · p SO 3 where k c is the “intrinsic” reaction rate constant and p SO 3 the SO3 partial pressure; thus the design equation (4) becomes: (6) F SO 3 0 · ⅆ X = k c · p SO 3 · ⅆ z · A sc The SO3 partial pressure is a function of conversion X and inlet concentration and pressure. If ni is the number of moles of species “i”, including the inert “In” (e.g. nitrogen or H2O) and p t the total pressure, we can express the SO3 partial pressure as follows: p SO 3 = p t · n SO 3 n SO 3 + n SO 2 + n O 2 + n In = p t · n SO 3 0 · ( 1 − X ) n SO 3 0 · ( 1 − X ) + n SO 3 0 · X + 0.5 · n SO 3 0 · X + n In ⇒ p SO 3 = p t · 1 − X ( p t 0 / p SO 3 0 ) + 0.5 · X = 1 − X ( 1 / p SO 3 0 ) + 0.5 · X · ( 1 / p t ) Then: (7) p SO 3 = p SO 3 0 · 1 − X 1 + 0.5 · X · ( p SO 3 0 / p t ) It is possible to observe that the “volume expansion” term 0.5 · X · ( p SO 3 0 / p t ) can be neglected ( 1 + 0.5 · X · ( p SO 3 0 / p t ) ≅ 1 ) , due to the relatively low expansion (maximum 50% increase of the initial volume) associated to reaction (2), the limited conversion (usually <75%, i.e. X <0.75) and the presence of diluting steam (using 96wt% H2SO4 we already have SO3 <50vol% in the feed, i.e. p SO 3 0 / p t < 0.50 ). Then: (8) p SO 3 = p SO 3 0 · ( 1 − X ) And, based on eq. (6) the following equation can be obtained: (9) ⅆ X 1 − X = k c · p SO 3 0 · ⅆ z · A sc F SO 3 0 Integration of equation (9) gives the following: (10) − ln ( 1 − X ) = k c · p SO 3 0 · V R F SO 3 0 = k c · p SO 3 0 · W cat F SO 3 0 · ρ cat where V R is total reactor volume, W cat and ρ cat are the total weight and the density of the catalytic bed, respectively. Therefore, the following equation can be drawn from eqs. (3) and (10): (11) − ln ( 1 − X ) = k WHSV where k is an “apparent” kinetic constant (h−1) depending on temperature T through the Arrhenius law expression: (12) k = A · ⅇ − E a R T with E a being the activation energy (kJ/mol). Hence, eqs. (11) and (12) link the obtained conversion X with the mass of catalyst (by the WHSV value) as well as with all temperature/pressure effects embodied in the kinetic constant k. By fitting the experimental results, the kinetic parameters reported in Table 8 are extracted. It can be seen that there is good agreement between the activation energy (E a) values obtained from the two different experimental campaigns (No. 1 and No. 2). Figs. 6–8 show the correspondence between the experimental data obtained and the predicted ones from eqs. (11) and (12), as calculated by using the kinetic parameters in Table 8. It can be seen that, with the exception of a few points, the kinetic model represented by eq. (11) with the calculated parameters in Table 8 fairly predicts the obtained experimental results and, hence, can be applied for the dimensioning of the decomposer. A higher pre-exponential factor (A) was obtained for the Fe2O3-coated SiSiC fragments in No. 2 tests and this is mainly attributed to the higher surface area available for catalyzing the reaction. Also for the Fe2O3 pellets case, a higher pre-exponential factor A (Table 8) resulted from No. 2 tests, most likely due to the smaller particle size (i.e. higher active surface). This statement is in agreement with the much higher pre-exponential factors that can be obtained from other experimental data published in the literature [25], where micrometric fine powders were used. For example, the obtained kinetic law predicts well the experimental points recently obtained by Banerjee et al. [28] with 4–6mm sized Fe2O3 pellets, while slightly underestimates the SO3 conversion obtained by Ginosar et al. [27] who used smaller Fe2O3 particle sizes (0.1–1.9mm). It must be noted that the kinetic equation determined here does not consider the reverse reaction effect. Lin and Flaherty [25] assumed a first-order kinetic law too, but included this “thermodynamic” restriction (i.e. reaction rate is zero when conversion X approaches the equilibrium value X e) using a fictitious “relative conversion” X ¯ : (13) X ¯ = X X e Differently, in our approach the “effective” fractional conversion X is used together with the constraint that reaction rate zeroes when X approaches X e to account for the reverse reaction effects. However, although the kinetic equation discussed above (eq. (11)) is theoretically applicable only far enough from thermodynamic equilibrium, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7 it also fairly predicts experimental data obtained close to equilibrium (i.e. X e − X <15%). Finally, an additional proof of the stability of the Fe2O3-coated SiSiC catalyst system over 100h on stream was obtained during the No. 2 tests. In fact, the initial No. 2 tests were carried out with fresh catalyst thus obtaining the experimental points reported in Table 7. Then, several tests were carried out with the same catalyst sample, changing the operating parameters to determine the above kinetic law. During non-operational periods, the catalyst was always exposed to the typical reaction environment (i.e. 775–875°C, with presence of SO3/SO2/O2/steam) up to the time that an overall exposure period of 115h was estimated. At the end of the series of tests (No. 2), new experimental points at 1atm were obtained, as reported in Table 9 , where it is noticeable that experimental points obtained with the spent catalyst (ca. 115h aged) are still well predicted by the previously obtained kinetic law. Therefore, kinetic parameters have not been subjected to significant changes and this confirms that this catalyst system is stable under the operating conditions employed."
9,Conclusions,"The endothermic catalytic reduction of sulfur trioxide into sulfur dioxide and oxygen is the high-temperature step of sulfur-based thermochemical cycles. Its coupling with a C-free heat source, either solar or nuclear, can be achieved either directly in a solar reactor heated by concentrated solar radiation, or indirectly by means of a heat-exchanger/decomposer reactor using a suitable heat transfer fluid. However, these two kinds of reactors have different operating conditions in terms of pressure and employ the catalyst structure in different forms (as coated on honeycombs and in pelletized form, respectively). For an effective design and operation of both such kinds of reactors, it is necessary to assess the durability of the catalyst structures under the harsh reaction conditions environment as well as to derive reliable SO3 decomposition kinetic models under realistic operation conditions. The low cost and large availability of iron(III) oxide makes this SO3 splitting catalyst attractive for large scale application in the “sulfur family” thermochemical cycles. In this work, the performance of this catalyst has been investigated, in terms of activity and stability, under realistic operating conditions (ca. 96wt% sulfuric acid, temperature range 775–900°C, pressure range 1–4bar, catalysts tested both in the form of Fe2O3 pellets and Fe2O3-coated SiSiC honeycombs or fragments). Results obtained confirmed that Fe2O3 can provide a secure fall back option as catalyst coating towards SO3 splitting, comparable to the more expensive platinum-based materials. Indeed Fe2O3-coated SiSiC honeycombs demonstrated the necessary specifications that a suitable catalytic system should fulfill, namely notable catalytic activity (around 80%, very close to the thermodynamic limit) and negligible deactivation after exposure to the harsh reaction conditions for 100h. Small amounts of sulfate on the spent catalyst surface suggest that the catalysis mechanism proceeds via the formation of an intermediate sulfate. Similar tests with non-coated SiSiC honeycombs showed that SiSiC possesses a low (but not negligible) catalytic activity. An experimental parametric study under operating conditions similar to the real design conditions for the two kinds of reactors was undertaken to investigate the effect of relevant reaction parameters – temperature, pressure and WSHV – on the SO3-to-SO2 conversion. The relevant experiments have shown that in the 1–4bar range, pressure does not exhibit a significant effect on decomposition kinetics. Additionally, an SO3 splitting kinetic equation was obtained for the Fe2O3-based catalysts to provide the necessary input for the decomposer design."
