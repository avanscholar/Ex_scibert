0,Introduction,"To address global energy crisis and environmental deterioration, clean energy resources have been in widely researched [1–4]. The discovery of TiO2 photocatalyst producing H2 under solar irradiation in 1972 opened up a promising way for converting solar energy to H2 fuel [5]. Photochemical water splitting has attracted great interest in the future energy field [6]. Thus far, semiconductor photocatalyst has made considerable achievements in generating H2 energy by splitting water [7]. Nevertheless, the larger part of semiconductors has wide band-gap which result in the narrow solar spectral response range and the low efficiency of solar energy [8–10]. Hence, developing visible-light-responsive photocatalysts with the response to 43% of the whole solar spectrum is attracting great attention in recent years [11-16]. Designing appropriate heterogeneous photocatalytic systems can take full advantage of the components. Heterojunction-type II is one species of representative heterogeneous photocatalytic systems which isolates the photo-generated carriers to inhibit their recombination [17,18]. However, the improvement on charges separation of Heterojunction-type II weaken the redox ability of semiconductor photocatalyst since the photo-generated charges concentrate on the band with lower redox potential. Hence, the photocatalytic processes which require strong redox ability, particularly for H2 production, are at a disadvantage. These problems can be solved by Z-scheme photocatalytic system [19,20]. Z-scheme photocatalytic system forming through coupling of two semiconductors owns the identical band alignment with Heterojunction-type II and the contrary path of charges transfer. In the system, the photoelectrons in the semiconductor with lower potential of conduction band (CB) will recombine with the photo holes in other semiconductor with higher potential of valence band (VB), to persist the respective higher redox ability and achieve the aim of enhancing the high separation rate of photo-generated carriers [21–24]. Among multitudinous semiconductors, cadmium sulfide (CdS) has suitable band gap (2.4 eV) and conduction band potential for hydrogen evolution and photodegradation [25,26]. Nevertheless, CdS has the low activity and stability, hindering its practical applications, in virtue of the rapid recombination of photogenerated charges and photo-corrosion [27]. In order to overcome these shortcoming, combining CdS with other semiconductors is an extremely feasible solution [28,29]. Cadmium tungstate (CdWO4) has better chemical, optical, structural property and outstanding thermal stability in all tungstates [30,31]. However, CdWO4 has a wide band gap (3.8 eV) causing confining to solar spectral response range [32]. CdS/CdWO4 composites can form heterojunction and give full play to their merits. In this work, the long CdS nanorods were sensitized by thiourea and loaded in different ratios with short CdWO4 nanorods, and the composites possess a favorable contact interface to facilitate the formation of ohmic contact. The composites display obviously Z-scheme pathway for charges transfer which enhances redox ability of CdS/CdWO4 and demonstrates by radical trapping experiments and XPS. Furthermore, the CdS/CdWO4 composites were characterized by different techniques like XRD, SEM, TEM, Raman and PL etc. to investigate the optical and structural property of CdS/CdWO4 heterojunction. The photoelectrochemical performance of samples was manifested by photocurrent response experiment and EIS."

The mixture reacted at 160 °C for 24 h in a 100 mL of Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. And then, when the mixture cooled down, the product was collected by centrifugation and washed by ethanol and water repeatedly, following dried at 60 °C for 5 h."

Then, the solution B was added to solution A dropwise under stirring. After stirring for 30 min, the mixture reacted at 180 °C for 24 h in a 100 mL of Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. And then, when the mixture cooled down, the product was collected by centrifugation and washed by ethanol and water repeatedly, following dried at 60 °C for 5 h."
4,Fabrication of the CdS/CdWO4 composites,"2.3 Fabrication of the CdS/CdWO4 composites The CdS/CdWO4 composites were synthesized according to Ref. [33] with some modification. Firstly, CdWO4 and CdS were ultrasonicated in water (15 mL) for 1 h, respectively. Then the CdS suspension was added into CdWO4 suspension and ultrasonicated for 2 h. Subsequently, acetone (15 mL) was added into suspension, and after stirring for 24 h, the precipitation was collected by centrifugation, dried overnight. A series of CdS/CdWO4 composites with different CdS content (30 wt%, 50 wt%, 70 wt% and 100 wt%) were synthesized and denoted as 0.3-CdS/CdWO4, 0.5-CdS/CdWO4, 0.7-CdS/CdWO4 and 1.0-CdS/CdWO4, respectively."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) was examined by a Rigaku D/Max-2500PC X-ray diffractometer employing Cu Kα radiation. The morphology of the materials was characterized by a JSM-6360LA scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL, Japan) and a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (TEM). Total organic carbon (TOC) was gauged by a Shimadzu-GL TOC-L CPH. Raman spectra was measured by a LabRAM XploRA Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, France) with a laser of 532 nm. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) spectra was performed by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550) with integrating sphere and BaSO4 as white standard. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra was measured by an Agilent Cary Eclipse."
6,Photocatalytic activity of malachite green degradation,"2.5 Photocatalytic activity of malachite green degradation The photocatalytic performance of samples was measured by the degradation of MG (100 mg/L) under visible-light irradiation (1 kW Xe lamp). In each experiment, before irradiation, the suspensions of photocatalyst (30 mg) in MG (50 mL) stirred for 30 min in dark to balance adsorption-desorption. Subsequently, the suspension (about 2 mL) was extracted every 20 min and the concentration of pure solution was analyzed by gauging the maximum absorbance of MG at 617 nm by a UV759 UV–vis spectrometer. The formula, D = ln (Ct/C0) × 100%, was used to calculate the degradation efficiency where C0 and Ct values were replaced by absorption according to Lambert-Beer law."
7,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"2.6 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution H2 production by photochemical water splitting was conducted in a closed gas system with a top irradiation (PLS-SXE300/300UV Xe lamp with a cutoff filter). The photocatalyst (10 mg) was dispersed by ultrasonic dispersion in the aqueous solution (100 mL) containing Na2S (0.35 M) and Na2SO3 (0.25 M) as sacrificial agent. The amount of H2 gas was detected by an online thermal conductivity detector (TCD) gas chromatography (NaX zeolite column, TCD detector, N2 carrier)."
8,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.7 Photoelectrochemical measurements The photoelectrochemical performance was measured by a CHI660D electrochemical workstation with three-electrode including a Pt wire as the counter electrode (cathode), an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode and the working electrode (photoanode) prepared by samples, respectively. A simulated sunlight (PLS-SXE300/300UV Xe lemp irradiation) acted as the light source. The photocurrent stability of samples was gauged in Na2SO4 solution (0.1 M) for 360 s under illumination. The EIS experiment in dark and under irradiation was measured at a frequency range of 1–106 Hz with 0.05 V amplitude. The Mott-Schottky plots were analyzed by the Impedance-Potential mode at a frequency of 1 kHz under irradiation."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characteristics of CdS/CdWO4 composites,"3.1 Characteristics of CdS/CdWO4 composites The phase structures and physicochemical properties of the samples are examined by XRD. In Fig. 1 , the characteristic diffraction peaks for pure CdWO4 are homologous with JCPDS file No. 14-0676. The XRD patterns of the samples (0.3-CdS/CdWO4, 0.5-CdS/CdWO4, 0.7-CdS/CdWO4 and 1.0-CdS/CdWO4) exhibit additional characteristic peaks at 24.81°, 26.51°, 28.18°, 36.62° and 43.68° which are consistent with (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2) and (1 1 0) of monoclinic CdS (JCPDS file No. 41-1049). Moreover, the intensity of CdS peaks enhances with the content increasing of CdS from 30 wt% to 100 wt%. From the XRD patterns, the distinct and intense diffraction peaks indicate high degree of crystallinity of samples, and the significantly change of the XRD patterns of CdS/CdWO4 composites demonstrate that the samples were two-phase without other impurity. The SEM and TEM images are used to further explore the form of CdS/CdWO4, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 . In (Fig. 2a and b), the microstructure of CdS nanorods displays with 1 mm of length and 35 nm of width approximately. (Fig. 2c) and 2d reveal that the CdWO4 show a short-rod-like morphology. After loading, the microstructure of CdS/CdWO4 are exhibited in (Fig. 2e and f). In the HRTEM image (Fig. 2 g) of CdS/CdWO4, the lattice spacing of 0.335 nm and 0.116 nm is corresponded to (0 0 2) planes of CdS and ( −1 1 1) planes of CdWO4, respectively. The EDS analysis of 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites (Fig. 2 h) indicates the existence of O, W, S and Cd elements in the samples. EDS mapping images (Fig. 2i) further show the existence of O, W, S and Cd elements, resulting from the CdS/CdWO4 composite. Fig. 3 exhibits the Raman spectra of CdWO4, CdS and CdS/CdWO4 composites. The intensity of peaks varies in the concentration of CdS. One distinctive peak at 897 cm−1 and one weak peak at 309 cm−1 are ascribed to Cd-O stretching in CdWO4, and the weak peak located at 389 cm−1 is associated with W-O vibrations in CdWO4, while the peak at 554 cm−1 is the symbol of symmetrical W-O-W stretching [34]. The Raman spectra of CdS manifests two obvious peaks located at 303 cm−1 and 604 cm−1, which are consistent with the first-order (1LO) and second-order (2LO) longitudinal optical phonon modes of CdS [35]. Raman spectra is significantly under the influence of phonon confinement, strain, defect and broadening associated with the size distribution [36]. The shift of 1LO and 2LO mode in CdS nanorods is in relation to not only the phonon confinement but also the strain effect [37]. The peaks located at 303 cm−1, 604 cm−1 and 897 cm−1 of 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites demonstrate that the formation of hybrids has no influence on the respective connatural characteristic shape of CdS and CdWO4. Fig. 4 shows the DRS spectra and energy gap of CdS, CdWO4 and CdS/CdWO4 composites. In (Fig. 4a), CdS exhibits the wide absorption in visible region because of the narrow bandgap, and the edge band absorption of CdS and CdWO4 is around at 525 nm and 325 nm. The band gap of semiconductors is estimated from the crossover point of the extension linear portion according to a related curve of (Ahν)1/2 versus, and A, h and ν correspond to absorption ratio, Planck’s constant and light frequency, respectively. As displayed in (Fig. 4b), the band gap of CdS, CdWO4, 0.3-CdS/CdWO4, 0.5-CdS/CdWO4, 0.7-CdS/CdWO4 and 1.0-CdS/CdWO4 composites is estimated to be 2.33 eV, 3.30 eV, 2.34 eV, 2.25 eV, 2.32 eV and 2.33 eV. Based on above results, the combination of CdS and CdWO4 can enhance the light absorption capability of samples. Fig. 5 shows the N2 adsorption-desorption performance of samples. The surface areas of 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 (60.97 m2/g) is about 3.5 times that of CdS (16.36 m2/g), CdWO4 (17.51 m2/g), and the optimum sample over 0.3-CdS/CdWO4 (16.73 m2/g), 0.7-CdS/CdWO4 (27.35 m2/g) and 1.0-CdS/CdWO4 (34.94 m2/g). According to higher surface areas, the more active sites on the surface of photocatalysts will make the transfer of photogenerated charges easier and render the photocatalytic performance more excellent [38]. The chemical valence states of CdS/CdWO4 composites are determined by XPS. A wide-scan XPS spectrum of samples is given in (Fig. 6 a), exhibiting the existence of Cd, S, O, W and C elements. The binding energy of 285 eV according to C 1s transition is referred to adjust the binding energies of other elements. In (Fig. 6b), the Cd 3d peaks for CdS locate at 411.55 eV and 404.8 eV while the same peaks for CdWO4 locate at 411.5 eV and 404.75 eV are attributed to Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 [39]. The homologous Cd 3d peaks for 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 locate at 404.9 eV and 411.65 eV. (Fig. 6c) shows two peaks of S 2p at 161.25 eV (S 2p3/2) and 162.4 eV (S 2p1/2) [40]. The spectrum of W 4f in (Fig. 6d) exhibits two peaks at 35.15 eV and 37.3 eV for CdWO4 which match with W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2, in agreement with the W6+ ions in CdWO4 [41]. The binding energy of W 4f for 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 shifts to higher position at 35.4 eV and 37.5 eV contrast to that of CdWO4, demonstrating a decrease in valence of W6+ because of the charge transfer between 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 [21]. The spectrum of O 1 s (Fig. 6e) for 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 exhibits two peaks at 530.3 eV assigning to the lattice O atoms in CdWO4 and 531.75 eV attributing to the −OH on sample surface [42,43], while the peaks for CdWO4 locate at 530.1 eV and 531.75 eV. It is found that intensity of peaks in W 4f and O 1s spectrums decreases due to the lack of oxygen atoms, which demonstrates the oxygen vacancies in 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 [44]. The energy of O 1s shifts to higher position also suggesting the high concentration of oxygen vacancies in CdWO4 of CdS/CdWO4 [45]. The geometric structures of CdS (0 0 2) and CdWO4 ( −1 1 1) are constructed in (Fig. 7 a and b). The work functions are obtained by Ф = EV−EF, where EV and EF are the electrostatic potentials of the vacuum and Fermi levels, respectively. DFT calculations (Fig. 7c and d) indicate that the Fermi level of CdWO4 ( −1 1 1) is positive than that of CdS (0 0 2), which means electrons will rearrange and migrate from CdS to CdWO4 at the interface [46]. Afterwards, a depletion layer will form on CdS surface, while an accumulation layer will form on CdWO4 surface, causing the formation of internal electric field in the CdS/CdWO4 with the orientation from CdS to CdWO4 which restrains the further migration of electrons. And then, the mobility of electron from CdS to CdWO4 reaches equilibrium in the wake of the Fermi levels of CdS and CdWO4 reach the same level [47]. These analyses further confirm the generation of the Z-scheme heterostructure between CdS and CdWO4."
11,Photocatalytic performance of CdS/CdWO4 composites,"3.2 Photocatalytic performance of CdS/CdWO4 composites In the interest of further exploring the photocatalytic property, the degradation of MG added samples with visible-light is performed. Compared with other samples, the degradation efficiency of MG (Fig. 8 a) attains 97% with 100 min visible-light irradiation by adding 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites, which indicates that the 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites have the best photocatalytic property. The photocatalytic performance of CdS/CdWO4 composites enhances along with the content of CdS till 50 wt%, however, decreases while the content of CdS is more than 50 wt%. The key reason is that the excess adding of CdS would cause poor efficiency of the active sites on the CdS surface and lead to the decreasing of photoinduced electron transfer efficiency from CdS to CdWO4 surfaces, which bring about the decreasing of photocatalytic activity [48,49]. In (Fig. 8b), the absorption spectra of MG degrading at the time interval of 20 min with 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites exhibits the rapid degradation procedure, and the absorption band almost disappears through 100 min visible-light irradiation. The photodegradation process fits to ln(C0/Ct) = kappt, and the rate constant k have been given in (Fig. 8c). The results exhibit that the photodegradation rate of 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites is highest. Concretely, the kapp of MG degradation with 0.3-CdS/CdWO4, 0.5-CdS/CdWO4, 0.7-CdS/CdWO4, 1.0-CdS/CdWO4, pure CdS and CdWO4 are estimated to be 0.01507 min−1, 0.03097 min−1, 0.02397 min−1, 0.01297 min−1, 0.01125 min−1 and 0.00072 min−1, respectively. In order to appraise the stability of the 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites, the photocatalytic degradation efficiency is explored by cycling experiments (Fig. 8d). The photocatalytic activity of 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites has no apparent decrease after 5 times of cycling experiments. Besides, the XRD patterns of 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites exhibit that the crystal structure of samples through five cycling experiments is almost same as the fresh photocatalyst (Fig. 8e). The high stability and reusability in repeated cycles demonstrate that formation of CdS/CdWO4 composites availably inhibits the photocorrosion and photo-generated carriers’ recombination phenomenon of semiconductors to a certain degree. The photoluminescence spectra (PL), as a kind of general technical measurement, can further demonstrate the recombination process of photo-generated carriers between semiconductor materials. Generally, lower PL intensity illustrates lower recombination efficiency of photo-generated carriers and more excellent photocatalytic activity of samples. The PL spectra on the excitation wavelength with 260 nm of CdS and CdS/CdWO4 composites are shown in Fig. 9 . Compared with pristine CdS, the PL peak of CdS/CdWO4 composites shows a clear blue-shift owing to the existence of CdWO4. The PL peak intensity of 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites is the lowest, which manifests that 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites have outstanding photocatalytic activity. The coupling with CdS and CdWO4 can reduce the recombination efficiency and increase the transfer efficiency of photo-generated carriers to ameliorate the photocatalytic performance of semiconductor materials. For further explore the photodegradation effect, the TOC concentration of MG after degradation is shown in Fig. 10 . The results exhibit that the TOC concentration of MG degraded by 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites is 14.33 mg/L, which is far below original MG solution (352.8 mg/L), and the removal efficiency reaches to 95.94%. The TOC removal rate of MG with CdS, CdWO4 and CdS/CdWO4 composites are in consistent with the photodegradation efficiency. Meanwhile, the favorable removal of TOC manifests the approximately complete degradation of MG after photocatalytic reaction under visible-light irradiation. Fig. 11 displays the comparison of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performances with pure CdS and CdS/CdWO4 composites. It is found that the pure CdS shows the relatively low H2 production rate of about 658 μmol/h/g. The H2 productivity increases remarkably with the moderate coupling of CdWO4, and 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites show the highest average activity about 2400 μmol/h/g, which is approximate 3.6 times of pristine CdS. The enhanced H2 rate could be attributed to the appropriate coupling of CdWO4 and CdS which heightens the visible-light absorption and effective photoinduced charge separation of CdS/CdWO4 composites. However, the excessive adding of CdS instead reduces the surface-active sites due to the narrowing of interface between CdS and CdWO4. The photoelectrochemical behaviors are measured by transient photocurrent response spectrum, which reflects the capability of photo-generated charges interface separation [50]. (Fig. 12 a) exhibits that the initial photocurrent is zero for samples working electrodes in the dark, the photocurrent of 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites quickly increases and reached 40 μA/cm2, which is about 3-fold and 10-fold higher than that of CdS and CdWO4, respectively. Better PEC properties of 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites are attribute to the heterojunction between CdS and CdWO4, which extends the absorption spectrum of composites to improve utilization rate of solar energy effectively, hinders the recombination of photo-generated carriers and enhances efficient electrons transport. The EIS of CdS, CdWO4 and a series of CdS/CdWO4 is conducted to further investigate the interfacial conductivity. As shown in (Fig. 12b), compared with the pure CdS and CdWO4 Nyquist plots, the charge-transfer resistance of 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites is smaller both in dark and under visible-light irradiation which further manifests the effective separation of photo-generated pairs and rapid transmission of the interfacial electron-hole. Mott-Schottky (M-S) plots can be used to confirm the flat band potential of semiconductors [51]. In (Fig. 12c), the plots for CdS and CdWO4 with positive slope demonstrates the n-type property of samples, and the flat band potential obtained by M-S plots is an extremely approximation to the CB of semiconductors [52]. The flat band potentials (Fig. 12d) are −0.64 V and −0.11 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, pH = 7) for CdS and CdWO4, respectively. Based on the band gaps from UV–vis results, the VB of CdS and CdWO4 can be reckoned to be 3.19 V and 1.69 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, pH = 7)."
12,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.3 Photocatalytic mechanism The photoelectrons of CdWO4 are difficult to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction because of the CB position of CdWO4. Therefore, CdS serves as active sites of H2 evolution in CdS/CdWO4 composites. In CdS/CdWO4 composites, the defect levels may be created by the existence of oxygen vacancies below the conduction band and the enhanced photocatalytic ability can be ascribed to electrons excited from VB to defect levels or from defect levels to CB [53,54]. The radical trapping experiments for MG photodegradation adding with CdS and 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites are performed to further demonstrate the pathway of charge transfer. The scavengers AgNO3, 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and methyl alcohol (MeOH) are used to quench the electron (e−), superoxide radicals ( O), hydroxyl radicals ( OH) and the holes (h+), respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 13 . It is found that the degradation efficiency of MG indicated that CdS cannot generate OH because of the limited oxidizing ability of VB and the O and h+ radicals are major active species. Similarly, the adding of BQ suppresses the photocatalytic activity of 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites obviously, which suggests that O still takes effective influence on photodegrading. Upon the adding of MeOH, the dropped Kapp confirms the exist of h+. Nevertheless, the activity of 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites shows sizable decline along with the adding of AgNO3, confirming that e− was the significant active species. Owing to the potential level of CB in CdWO4 which is low to generate O (−0.13 V vs. Ag/AgCl, pH = 7) and reduce H+ to generate H2 (−0.21 V vs. Ag/AgCl, pH = 7), the photoelectron in 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 must site on CdS rather than CdWO4. The results further demonstrate that charge transfer in CdS/CdWO4 composites must obey the Z-scheme mechanism. In consideration of above-mentioned analysis, the Z-scheme mechanism is shown in Fig. 14 . In CdS/CdWO4 composites, the electrons on the CB of CdS are inclined to transfer to CdWO4 through the ohmic contact because of the more negative Fermi level of CdS until they are equilibrated [47]. However, the oxygen vacancies locating on the interface of CdS/CdWO4 induce the formation of ohmic contact by forming quasi-continuous energy levels and reduce the interfacial electric resistance. The holes coming from VB of CdS recombine with the electrons excited by visible-light irradiation in CB of CdWO4 through the ohmic contact. Consequently, photo-generated pairs in CdS/CdWO4 composites are well separated. The electrons in CB of CdS possessed the strong reducibility can drive hydrogen evolution and generate O. Moreover, the holes possessed strong oxidizability are available to degrade MG. Hence, this Z-scheme mechanism promotes the separation efficiency of photo-generated pairs in CdS/CdWO4 composites substantially, which effectively enhances the photocatalytic activity."
13,Conclusions,"In conclusion, CdS/CdWO4 composites has been synthesized successfully and the interfacial charge-transfer adhering to Z-scheme mechanism differed from conventional Heterojunction-type II. This heterojunction ameliorates the separation of charges and remains the redox ability of CdS and CdWO4. As a result, the optimal proportion of 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites exhibit remarkable enhanced photocatalytic H2 production rate of 2400 μmol/h/g and photodegradation activity (97%) of MG in 100 min. In particular, the H2 production rate is about 3.6 times of pure CdS. This work suggests the potential application of CdS/CdWO4 composites for photocatalytic H2 production in the future energy field."
