0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols are important raw materials and are widely used in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and energy sectors [1–4]. They are mainly produced from petrochemicals or by biological fermentation [1]. A potential alternative route, i.e., direct synthesis from syngas (CO and H2), is more efficient and environmentally friendly. Modification with an alkali-metal oxide of the Cu-based catalysts used for methanol production provides promising catalysts for the production of higher alcohols such as ethanol and isobutanol from syngas [3,4]. In these catalysts, the alkali-metal oxide acts as an electron donor or structural auxiliary and plays an important role in stabilizing the surface structure of the catalyst, inhibiting hydrocarbon formation, and thereby boosting formation of higher alcohols [5–13]. Reports of previous studies show [1,3,7,14–18] that K2O is the preferred promoter because it can affect the electronic states of Cu surface species and adsorption of CO through alkali-metal–Cu interactions. Campos et al. [14] reported that K is adsorbed on the top sites of a Cu(111) surface through local specific interactions. Li et al. [15] used Kelvin probe to investigate the co-adsorption of CO and K on Cu(111) surface. They found that CO was adsorbed on a K-covered Cu(111) surface at room temperature, and that the work function changed with the degree of coverage by K (θ K). An et al. [16] used a combination of transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to clarify the effects of K deposition on the atomic and electronic structures, and the chemical activities of Cu x O/Cu(111). The results showed pseudomorphic growth of K on the model catalyst up to a coverage of 0.19 ML. K binds to the surface by strong ionic interactions with chemisorbed oxygen and weak electrostatic interactions with Cu ions. The deposited K has a strong impact on the electronic structure of the surface, and this induces a significant reduction in the work function and strong electron polarization. They also found that the presence of K does not promote CO adsorption on the model catalyst but accelerates CO2 activation. Stelmachowski et al. [17] used the Kelvin method to investigate N2O decomposition on an alkali-metal-modified Co3O4 catalyst. They reported that modification improved the decomposition performance and suggested that this is because the electronic nature of the alkali metal lowers the spinel work function. Ou et al. [18] performed a systematic study of Na- and Cs-promoted Cu(111) catalysts and reported a reduction in the dissociation activation barrier of CO2. Although the described studies have improved our understanding of the effects of K on a Cu surface, the mechanism of CO activation on Cu surfaces modified with an alkali-metal oxide is still unclear for two reasons: (1) the electronic state of an alkali metal deposited on a surface differs from that of a surface-deposited alkali-metal oxide and (2) the larger configuration of the alkali-metal oxide affects the geometric configuration of the initial state, the transition state, and the final states, and modulates the reaction energy and reaction barrier of a specific elementary reaction. Theoretical investigations of the mechanism of C2 oxygenate formation on a Cu surface have been performed to clarify the initial CC bond formation process in alcohol synthesis by CO hydrogenation [5,19,20]. Zheng et al. [19] investigated the possible mechanisms of ethanol formation from syngas on a Cu(100) surface and found that CH3 insertion into CHO to give CH3CHO is the most favorable reaction (the activation energy is 0.44 eV), and is responsible for C2 oxygenate formation. In contrast, Zhang et al. [20] reported that C2 oxygenates are formed mainly by CO insertion into CH2 on a Cu(110) surface, with an activation barrier of 0.47 eV. Although deposition of K modulates the surface acidity or basicity of a Cu-based catalyst [21], there are no reports of theoretical studies of K2O-promoted Cu-based catalysts for C2 oxygenate formation from syngas. The activation of CO on a K2O-promoted Cu surface and the mechanism of C2 oxygenate formation also need to be clarified. In this study, to address these gaps in the literature, a K2O-modified Cu(111) model catalyst was constructed and DFT calculations were used to investigate the effects of K2O on CO activation and C2 oxygenate formation."
1,Computational detail,
2,Surface model,"2.1 Surface model Cu (111) surface was obtained from the experimental face centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure with the lattice parameter of 3.64 Å [22]. A periodic p (3 × 3) unit cell comprising nine atoms in each layer was used, which corresponds to an adsorbed surface of a 1/9 of a monolayer. The surface was modeled using a three-layer slab model with a 15 Å vacuum slab. In the optimization process, the atoms in the upper two layers together with the K2O, CO and other adsorbents were allowed to relax, whereas, the bottom one layer was fixed at their bulk position. The four different adsorption sites: top, bridge (bri), fcc hollow and hexagonal closed packed (hcp) hollow were shown as X. Sun. et al. [23]. K2O/Cu (111) surface was obtained based on the optimized Cu (111) surface by investigate the adsorption behavior of K2O on Cu (111) surface."
3,Calculation methods,"2.2 Calculation methods Spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna abinito simulation package (VASP) [24,25]. The interaction between ionic cores and electrons was described using the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [26]. The exchange-correlation energy was calculated within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) together with the (PBE) method [27,28]. After the optimization by PBE, revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (RPBE) functional was adopted to get the better agreement with experiment for the absorption energy of CO [28–30]. A plane wave basis set was 450 eV to solve the Kohn-Sham equations. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-points with the fessel-Paxton smearing of 0.10 eV. The relaxation of the electronic degrees of freedom was assumed to be converged, if the total energy change and the band structure energy change between two steps are both smaller than 10−5 eV. A force difference between two steps <0.01 eV/Å was used as the criterion for convergence of ionic relax. The climbing-image nudged elastic band methods (CI-NEB) [31,32] were used to investigate the transition states, and vibrational frequencies were analyzed to evaluate a transition state with only one imaginary frequency. The transition state was thought to be converged when the forces acting on the atoms are all lower than 0.05 eV/atom for the various degree of freedom atom. In addition, in the discussion of the DFT results, zero point energy (ZPE) corrections were included in this study if necessary. The molecules in the gas phase were calculated using a 10 × 10 × 10 Å cubic unit cell. The adsorption energy that was used to measure the strength of adsorbent-substrate adsorption are defined as follows: E ads = E sub + E mol − E mol / sub where Esub and Emol are the total energies of substrate and free adsorbent alone, Emol/sub is the total energy of adsorbent-substrate system in the equilibrium state. With this definition, positive values of adsorption energy denote that adsorption is more stable than the corresponding substrate and free molecules. For the dissociate of CO on the K2O/Cu (111) surface, the reaction energy (ΔE) and activation barriers (Ea) were calculated on the basis of the following equations: ∆ E = E pro / K 2 O / Cu 111 − E rea / K 2 O / Cu 111 E a = E TS / K 2 O / Cu 111 − E rea / K 2 O / Cu 111 where Epro/[K2O/Cu(111)] is the total energy for the products, Erea/[K2O/Cu(111)] is the total energy for the reactants and ETS/[K2O/Cu(111)] is the energy of transition state of an elementary reaction on K2O/Cu (111) surface."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Adsorption of K2O on Cu(111) surface,"3.1 Adsorption of K2O on Cu(111) surface The binding abilities of K2O at interfacial sites were compared by calculating the K2O adsorption energies at various sites on the Cu(111) surface, including O atom adsorption at fcc, hcp, top, and bri sites. The detailed adsorption configurations are shown in Fig. 1 . On the Cu(111) surface, the fcc site is the primary binding position for K2O adsorption, with an energy release of 4.60 eV. The binding strengths of the top, bri, and hcp sites with K2O are lower (4.57–4.58 eV, Table 1 ). Our calculated binding energies are not consistent with recently published theoretical results. Wang et al. obtained a binding energy of 3.47 eV at the GGA-PW91 level [33], which is 1.13 eV lower than that in our work. The deviation of the GGA-PW91 value from our PBE value is at least partially explained by the different calculation levels. The detailed adsorption configurations of K2O at the above sites (Table 1 and Fig. 1) show that there is little difference among the geometric properties of K2O adsorbed on different sites on the Cu(111) surface. Our calculated geometric structures for K2O are consistent with those reported by Wang et al. [33] and Zasada et al. [10]. The small impacts of surface sites on the adsorption configurations and binding energies can be ascribed to the high mobility of K2O on Cu(111) surfaces, as shown by the calculated results reported by Petersen et al. [34]. To explore the effects of K2O on the electron distribution on the Cu(111) surface, we analyzed the Bader charges on K2O/Cu(111) and Cu(111) surfaces (Table 2 ). The charge on the Cu surface with adsorbed K2O is more negative than that on the clean Cu(111) surface. Although the calculated Bader charge is smaller than that reported by Wang [33], the trend in the charge distribution in our calculations is consistent with Wang's results. This indicates that K2O donates electrons to the Cu(111) surface, and this interaction would modulate CO activation."
6,Dissociation of CO on K2O/Cu(111) surface,"3.2 Dissociation of CO on K2O/Cu(111) surface The CO activation pathways on catalysts for alcohol synthesis from CO have been extensively investigated in previous studies [5,12,19,20,34–37]. The direct dissociation of CO can start with CO bond scission to form adsorbed C and O, followed by CH bond formation to produce CH x (x = 1, 2, and 3). Alternatively, CH or CO bond formation can occur first to give a CH x O intermediate which can further hydrogenated into CHx; these C1 monomers can then participate in the formation of C2 oxygenates. In this work, DFT calculations were performed on K2O/Cu(111) surfaces to investigate CO adsorption. Then CO activation was investigated by CI-NEB analysis to verify the reaction routes of CO on a K2O-promoted Cu-based catalyst. Adsorption of the reactants and all possible intermediates involved in CO activation on clean and K2O-promoted Cu(111) surfaces were all considered. The preferential adsorption positions and corresponding adsorption energies are listed in Table 3 [K2O/Cu(111)] and Table 4 [Cu(111)]. According to our DFT calculations, CO on Cu(111) preferentially occupies the hcp site, with a binding energy 1.06 eV (Table 4); this agrees well with the results of other calculations at a similar level of theory [19,20,22,35,36]. We found that the adsorption energy of CO after K2O modification (1.06 eV) is the same as that for the unmodified surface, but the adsorption energies of C, O, and CHO are changed by K2O addition. The calculated results are consistent with those from Mei's and Liu's study [12,38]. A comparison of the activation routes on clean and K2O-doped Cu(111) surfaces shows differences between the two catalysts. The activation barrier for direct dissociation of CO decreases by 2.50 eV after K2O promotion (3.79 eV vs 1.29 eV, see Figs. 2 and 3 , and Figs. S1 and S2). This suggests that K2O makes direct dissociation of CO energetically favorable. This trend is in accordance with those seen in previous studies [10]. Similar results were obtained for CHO formation (Figs. 2 and 3, and Figs. S1 and S2); the reaction barrier decreases by 0.18 eV (1.10 vs 0.92 eV). The effects of K2O on COH formation were also investigated by DFT calculations. Unlike direct dissociation and CHO formation, the activation barrier is 0.99 eV higher after K2O modification (4.18 vs 3.19 eV, Figs. 2 and 3, and Figs. S1 and S2). The different effects of K2O addition on CO activation can be at least partially explained by enhancement of the adsorption energies of C, O, CHO, and COH caused by electrostatic interactions (Tables 3 and 4) [38]. Similar trends in the effects of K2O or K on the activation of CO and related species in many reactions associated with CO hydrogenation have been reported. Zhao et al. [35] showed that K2O adsorption can stabilize or destabilize surface CH x species and modify the effective barriers because of short-ranged promotion and electronic effects. Petersen et al. [34] viewed the interactions between co-adsorbed CO and zero-valent K, which can enhance CO adsorption and weaken the CO bond. Erikat [39] found that K atom could stabilize reactants and increase the reactivity of an Ir(100) catalyst in CO oxidation. In our study, a similar pattern was observed for the effects of K2O on CO adsorption, and the adsorption and reaction trends are in accordance with those previously reported. Bader charge analysis was performed to investigate the origins of these differences. The data in Table 2 show that when CO is adsorbed on a K2O/Cu(111) surface, the charge on CO becomes more negative because both Cu and K2O donate charge to CO (see Table 2). The obtained patterns of interactions between K2O, CO, and the catalyst are similar to those for CO adsorption on a K-doped MoS2(100) surface [12]. The altered surface electron distribution on CO and the K2O/Cu(111) surface modulate CO activation. This will be discussed in Section 3.3. On the basis of the above results, we conclude that the hydrogenation of CO to CHO and direct dissociation to C and O are more plausible. Fig. 2 shows that the barriers to formation of CHO and C + O are 0.92 and 1.29 eV, respectively. Both reactions are more favorable than COH formation, and CHO formation is preferred. The CO adsorbed on the K2O/Cu(111) surface undergoes hydrogenation to form CHO."
7,Formation of CH x (x = 1–3),"3.3 Formation of CH x (x = 1–3) Light hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, and propylene are the major byproducts of higher alcohol synthesis from syngas. CH x species are considered to be the monomers that polymerize to form these hydrocarbons, therefore the origin of these species is important in studying the use of carbon resources. Two previously reported possible pathways were investigated in this study. One is the direct hydrogenation of the C atom, the other is H-assisted dissociation of CH x O (x = 1, 2, and 3). The results of the two possible pathways are calculated and discussed in the following text. 3.3.1 CH x (x = 1–3) formation by dissociated CO hydrogenation CH x (x = 1, 2, and 3) formation from C and H on the K2O/Cu(111) surface were studied with the aim of understanding the possibility of CH x formation via dissociated CO hydrogenation. The formation of CH x starts with CO bond scission to produce adsorbed C and O, followed by CH bond formation to add the first, second, and third H atoms to C (C + H → CH + H → CH2 + H → CH3). In this pathway, the first H can be transferred to a bri site on the Cu surface, to give TS 3-1 with a CH distance of 1.90 Å (Fig. S2). The CH bond formation step is exothermic by 1.35 eV via a 0.89 eV barrier (Fig. 4A), and leads to the formation of a CH intermediate at the top site of the Cu surface (Fig. S2). The second hydrogenation occurs by CH bond formation with CH species, in which H can be transferred to CH via TS 3-2 (Fig. S2). The CH bond formation step is exothermic by 0.25 eV (Fig. 4B), and the activation barrier is much lower than that for the first CH bond formation (0.21 vs 0.89 eV). This suggests that formation of the second CH bond would easily proceed. In the third step, the H is transferred from a hollow site on the Cu surface to CH2; the distance between C atom and dissociated H atom decreases to 3.91 Å in the transition state (Fig. S2). Formation of the CH bond is endothermic by 0.01 eV and the activation barrier is high (1.85 eV, Fig. 4C). This indicates that it would be difficult for this process to proceed. The above analysis suggests that CH2 is the dominant species formed from CO direct dissociation because of the lower activation energy (0.21 eV) and moderate reaction energy. 3.3.2 CH x formation by CH x O (x = 1–3) hydrogenation As mentioned earlier, another crucial pathway for CH x formation on a K2O/Cu(111) surface is H-assisted dissociation of CH x O (x = 1, 2, and 3). For CH formation, the reaction starts with CHO hydrogenation. Figs. 5 and S3 show that the barriers to formation of CHOH, CH + OH, and CH2O are 0.92, 1.28, and 0.69 eV, respectively. The figure also shows that the formation barriers for the three mentioned species are 0.50, −0.09, and −0.34 eV, respectively. Accordingly, CH2O formation is more favorable on the K2O/Cu(111) surface. Similarly, CH2O hydrogenation to CH2 and OH is preferred to formation of CH2OH and hydrogenation to CH3O (Figs. 6 and S4). Higher barriers, i.e., 1.49 and 0.98 eV, are obtained for CH2OH formation and CH2O dissociation, respectively, whereas a calculated barrier of 0.67 eV is obtained for the formation of CH2. In addition, Fig. 6 shows that the production of CH2 and OH is more favorable than CH2OH and CH3O formation; this is because of the lower formation energy (−0.35 vs 0.19 eV and −0.76 eV) on the K2O/Cu(111) surface. We therefore conclude that CH2 is the most favored monomer produced by CH2O hydrogenation. The calculated barrier for CH3 formation by CH3O hydrogenation is 1.51 eV (Fig. 7 ), with CO bond cleavage that is endothermic by 0.57 eV. This leads to the formation and adsorption of CH3 at the bri site of the Cu surface via C (Fig. S5). Some interesting comparisons can be made regarding the formation of CH3 through CH2 hydrogenation and CH3O dissociation. An activation barrier difference of 0.34 eV is observed. However, the activation energy for the two pathways are all above 1.50 eV (1.51 vs 1.85 eV), which indicates that CH3 formation would hardly proceed in our limited study. The above analysis of CH x formation suggests that when H reacts with CO adsorbed on the K2O/Cu(111) surface, CO → CHO → CH2O → CH2 is the optimal pathway for CH x formation, and CH2 is the most favored CH x monomer, both kinetically and thermodynamically."
8,Methanol formation by CH3O hydrogenation,"3.4 Methanol formation by CH3O hydrogenation On a Cu-based catalyst, the hydrogenation of CH3O to produce CH3OH is considered to be the slow step in methanol synthesis from syngas [22]. On a K2O/Cu(111) surface, methanol formation can start from the reaction of CH3O and H, with an activation barrier of 3.32 and heat release of 0.05 eV (Figs. 7 and S5). Calculations were also performed for methanol formation on a Cu(111) surface for comparison. Our calculations gave an activation barrier of 1.43 eV, which is endothermic by 0.19 eV (Fig. S6). These values are consistent with the available theoretical results (listed in Table 5 ). The reaction barrier and reaction energy are clearly higher when K2O is present, which implies that methanol formation is inhibited by adding this auxiliary. The difference for the structures of the transition states TS 3-11(Fig. S5) and TS (Fig. S6) for this pathway show that the distance between CH2OH and H on the K2O/Cu(111) surface is 1.93 Å larger than that on a pure Cu(111) surface. The deviations in the energies when K2O is present can be at least partially explained by interactions between O and K, which alter the configuration of the transition state and increase the reaction barrier by 1.89 eV."
9,C2 oxygenate formation,"3.5 C2 oxygenate formation Having clarified CO activation on a K2O-promoted Cu(111) surface, we then investigated the origins of C2 oxygenates in the K2O/Cu system. The possible reaction pathways among all the monomers are shown in Fig. 8 . These possible elementary reactions can be divided into three categories: (1) reactions between CH x and CO, (2) insertion of CH x into CHO, and (3) CC chain formation of C2 oxygenates via reactions between monomers such as CHO, CH2O, CH2, and CO. The potential energy diagram and detailed structures for these reactions are shown in Figs. 9 and S7–S9. Calculations were performed for three possible reaction pathways for CH x insertion into CO. Figs. 9A and S7 show that the barriers for forming CHCO, CH2CO, and CH3CO are 0.66, 1.78, and 1.43 eV, respectively. All the reactions are exothermic, and CHCO formation is preferred. CH x CO formation has been investigated by many researchers. Zhang et al. [20] reported that the activation barriers and reaction energies on a Cu(110) surface are 0.46 and − 0.34 eV for CH2 + CO → CH2CO, and 1.07 and −0.08 eV for CH3 + CO → CH3CO. Zheng et al. [19] reported an activation barrier of 1.01 eV and a reaction energy of −0.21 eV for CH3CO formation from CH3 and CO on a Cu(100) surface. The results discussed above show that the activation barriers and reaction energies obtained in previous studies differ from those obtained in the present study (see Table 6 ). This indicates that the C2 oxygenate formation route is modulated by K2O promotion. The activation barriers for the three possible elementary reactions increase with increasing number of H atoms in the CH x group. An examination of the effects of K2O and the volume of CH x groups suggests that the interactions between K and O will have a significant impact on the configurations of CH3 and CO, and this will change the possible C2 oxygenate formation route. After studying the possible reactions between CH x and CO, we investigated the possible reactions between CHO and CH x . The activation barriers for CHOCH, CHOCH2, and CHOCH3 formation are 0.01, 1.08, and 1.74 eV, respectively, with reaction energies of −1.40, −1.91, and −1.08 eV, respectively (Figs. 9B and S8). Some interesting observations were also made to probe the possible C2 oxygenate formation routes from CHO and CH x . Wang et al. investigated CHOCH formation through CHO and CH on CuZn(211) and Cs2O–CuZn(211) surfaces; activation barriers of 1.04 and 0.85 eV were obtained [5]. These values are much higher than those obtained from our calculations. The differences between our results and those reported by Wang may arise from the differences between the basicities and sizes of K2O and Cs2O [21]. Zheng et al. [19] obtained activation barriers of 0.51 and 0.12 eV for CHOCH3 formation on Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces, respectively. The values obtained from our calculations are smaller than those reported by Wang but larger than those reported by Zheng. The deviations are probably the result of promotion by the alkali-metal oxide, which changes the geometric structures of the adsorbed monomers involved in the reaction by electrostatic interactions, as discussed above. A comparison of the trends in the activation barriers shows that the values gradually increase with increasing number of H atoms. This trend is similar to that for reactions between CH x and CO. We conclude that stronger interactions between H atoms in CHO and CH x and O in K2O and CHO altered the energies and configurations of the transition states. As discussed in Section 3.3, CHO, CH2O, and CH2 are the predominant monomers formed during CO hydrogenation on a K2O/Cu(111) surface. Calculations were performed to investigate the possibilities of CC bond formation between CO and these monomers and the interactions among CHO, CH2O, and CH2. For CC bond formation from CHO and CO, an activation barrier of 0.39 eV and a reaction energy of 0.23 eV were obtained (Fig. 9B). In transition state TS 3-18, CO binds on the bri site through its C atom, CHO is adsorbed on the top site through the C atom, and the distance between the two bases is shortened to 3.28 Å (Fig. S9). The calculated activation energies for this elementary reaction are 0.65 and 0.46 eV higher than those for the reactions on CuZn(211) and Cs2O–CuZn(111) surfaces [5], respectively, and the reaction energies are 1.78 and 2.00 eV higher than those with the CuZn and Cs2O–CuZn catalysts, respectively. This indicates that the reaction process on the K2O/Cu(111) catalyst is different from that on the CuZn catalyst. Other possible pathways for C2 oxygenate formation from CH2, CHO, CO, and CH2O were also investigated. Fig. S9 shows the configurations of the initial state, transition state, and final state for the pathways TS 3-19 (CH2O + CH2 → CH2OCH2), TS 3-20 (CH2O + CO → CH2OCO), and TS 3-21 (CH2O + CHO → CH2OCHO). The reaction coordinates of the three elementary reactions are shown in Fig. 9C. For TS 3-19, the reaction has an activation barrier of 0.41 eV and is exothermic by 0.61 eV. The CC bond distance between CH2O and CH2 decreases from 3.57 Å in the initial state to 3.00 Å in the transition state to 1.68 Å in the final state. For CC bond formation from CH2O and CO, our DFT calculation gave an activation barrier of 1.09 eV and reaction energy of 0.90 eV. The distance between CH2O and CO decreases from 3.46 Å in the initial state to 2.39 Å in the transition state to 1.73 Å in the final state. For CC bond formation from CH2O and CHO, the reaction has an activation barrier of 0.46 eV and is exothermic by 0.24 eV. The distance between CH2O and CHO decreases from 3.15 Å in the initial state to 2.32 Å in the transition state to 1.52 Å in the final state. The results of our calculations indicate that the reaction between CHO and CH has the lowest activation barrier (only 0.01 eV, Fig. 9B), but CH formation via the direct route and the H-assisted route are both energy demanding. Other possibilities for CC bond formation should be considered. A comparison of the energy profiles of the elementary reactions that occur between most monomers clearly shows (Fig. 9C) that TS 3-19 is the most favorable C2 oxygenate formation route because it has the lowest activation barrier and reaction energy."
10,Conclusions,"In this study, spin-polarized DFT calculations with a periodic slab model were used to investigate the electronic states, CO activation, and C2 oxygenate formation route on a K2O/Cu(111) surface. Our results show that the Cu(111) surface was modulated by K2O addition. CO activation was altered by this modulation; H-assisted dissociation is more energetically favorable than CO direct dissociation for CO activation. For CHO formation by H-assisted dissociation of CO, CH2O and CH2 are the most favorable monomers. Methanol formation was retarded by K2O modification of Cu(111) because of the increased activation energy of the rate-determining step in CH3O hydrogenation. The reactions between CHO, CH2, and CO, i.e., the favored monomers, were further probed to investigate the possible pathways for initial C2 oxygenate formation. Our results show that CH2 insertion into CH2O to form CH2CH2O is the most favorable reaction route to C2 oxygenates, both kinetically and thermodynamically. The results show that boosting H-assisted dissociation of CO increases the concentrations of CHO, CH2, and CH2O on K2O-promoted Cu-based catalysts, and this eventually enhances production of higher alcohols."
