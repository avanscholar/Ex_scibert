0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is one of the ideal fuels for future as it can be produced by utilizing natural and renewable sources such as water and solar energy. The cost effectiveness of renewable H2 production is poor in comparison to the electrolyticaly produced H2. Moreover, major part of H2 also comes from the fossil fuel [1]. Thus there is a huge scope for further development in the field of H2 generation using natural resources. Photovoltaics and water electrolysis are becoming more competitive day by day with the price reduction and improvement in the device technology. Alternative to all the existing possibilities, photocatalytic water-splitting using TiO2 for hydrogen production offers a promising way for realizing clean, low-cost and environmentally friendly production of hydrogen by use of solar energy [2]. Honda and Fujishima, pioneers in photocatalytic generation of H2, investigated photo-electrochemical H2 generation through use of TiO2 electrode [3]. Latter revolutionary works were carried out in the field of photocatalysis by various leading research groups [4–7]. Significant part of this endeavor is dedicated to air/water purification [8–11]. However, small fraction of this effort was directed towards H2 generation [12,13]. Initial step of both the activities is the same i.e. absorption of light by the semiconductor, where, the charge carriers participating in the surface reaction are different [14–16]. In photocatalytic H2 generation, conduction band electron participates in the H2O reduction process, whereas valence band holes are the key component that participates in the destruction of organic and other surface contaminant [17–19], as shown in Fig. 1. Various types of semiconductor materials have been tried for the above purpose viz. TiO2, CdS, Cu2O and Co3O4 [20–23]. These catalysts possess high absorption co-efficient, but the efficiency of H2 generation is low due to unwanted dissipation of energy in form of electron–hole (e−–h+) recombination that drastically reduces light utilization efficiency [24–28]. In order to achieve industrial acceptance, certain aspects like cost effectiveness and facile synthesis of TiO2 should be on top of the priority list [27–29] . Nevertheless, to reduce the energy dissipation; excited electron lifetime is to be increased. Hence, for increasing the electron lifetime certain moiety need to be incorporated with TiO2 [30,31]. Plasmonic metals are widely adopted due to its profound activity in visible region. This then tends to active TiO2 in visible light irradiation and increase the efficiency in UV–vis irradiation [32]. In this review article we are describing about TiO2:Au nanocomposite synthesized by different synthetic methodology. Also, role of Au under different type of light irradiation and TiO2 is elaborated."
1,Background of the content,"As it is mentioned that TiO2 is the most preferred material for photocatalytic water splitting. Possible equation of water splitting is described based on TiO2 in the following section. Subsequently the effect of Au deposition with reference to other metals is also elaborated for better understanding. The synthetic strategy adopted for TiO2:Au nanocomposite formation is explained as it is very crucial because it affects the resultant physical property as well as hydrogen production efficiency. Furthermore, comparative hydrogen production yield is mentioned with respect to the existing mechanism and to justify its synthetic methodology. Also role of TiO2:Au interface under different types of irradiation and versatile TiO2 nanostructures is elaborated. Finally, a conclusion is drawn stating the best TiO2:Au nanocomposite in photocatalytic hydrogen production, its current challenges and possibility to overcome."
2,Photocatalytic H2 production using TiO2,"2.1 Photocatalytic H2 production using TiO2 Separation between conduction band (CB) and valence band (CB) or band gap in the range of electromagnetic radiation is the key factor responsible for photocatalytic hydrogen production using a semiconductor. Band gap of TiO2 is 3.2eV which is suitable only for UV-radiation absorption which accounts for ~4% of the total solar light. After irradiation of TiO2, electron from the VB gets excited to the CB, where it participates with the reactant present on the semiconductor surface in the adsorbed form without showing any photocorrosion, while the hole remaining in the VB participate in the oxidation of adsorbed species as shown in Fig. 1. Thus photocatalytic reaction either oxidation or reduction can be catalyzed more effectively by reducing the dimension of the TiO2. In connection with photocatalytic H2 production, TiO2 CB level is more negative than H2 production level (ξH2/H2O) while the VB is more positive than water oxidation level (ξO2/H2O) for efficient hydrogen and oxygen production from water by photocatalysis [33]. It was found that H2 production rate is much higher in case of water–alcohol mixture, particularly water–methanol mixture. It has been reported that in the absence of alcohol photocatalysis based on TiO2 remains very small even after the deposition of nobel metal. In addition to that, in the absence of alcohol, surface of the noble metal does get poisoned after few cycles due to the strong adsorption of oxygen species and finally bringing about various side reactions based on the formation of O 2 − by oxidation process. In presence of alcohol, such kinds of side reaction get suppressed due to alcohol reforming process in which alcohol work as a sacrificial agent. The life time of the catalyst is consequently enhanced. The alcohol consumption takes place by two distinct process: (1) alcohol reformation where hole combine with the alcohol to give H2 and CO2 and (2) O2 scavenging leading to the formation of H2O and CO2 [34] (1) CH3OH+3/2O2→CO2+2H2O Amount of O2 and CO2 evolved are constant and non-negligible which gives a hypothesis that all O2 produced after water splitting is not scavenged by alcohol. Presence of O2 in the exhaust gas also gives an indication of water splitting and hole consumption by water instead of alcohol that ultimately causes formation of O2 (2) H2O+2h+→2H++O2 Thus the overall H2 production can be represented by the following surface reaction: (3) CH3OH+H2O→CO2+3H2 It is well known that TiO2 is one of the most efficient photocatalyst in terms of stability and photoconversion efficiency amongst various other semiconductor materials. But it has some drawbacks which opens up multiple directions for research in TiO2 based photocatlysis as mentioned below: 1. Rate of recombination in case of excited charge is very high and is released in form of heat. 2. An absorption response of TiO2 to the electromagnetic radiation is very small and is one of the key factors for the low efficiency. 3. The chance of backward reaction is also possible i.e. combination of H2 and O2. To improve the photocatalytic property of TiO2, certain modifications are required to be done in electron donor or electron acceptor energy level. Electron donor falls in the category of chemical additive; however, second one belongs to catalyst modification. In terms of electron acceptor, modification is made by introducing a noble metal, metal ion doping, anion doping, dye sensitization, composite semiconductors, metal ion-implantation etc. Amongst the above mentioned techniques, noble metal loading and dye sensitization are useful in photocatalytic H2 generation. There are many reports which deals with the metal i.e. Pt deposition over semiconductor which forms p–n junction with the semiconductor (photocatalyst) and work as an electron sink, thus averting recombination process. However, high cost of Pt reduces the applicability of such a catalyst. Au NPs are comparatively cheaper to Pt and due to the inherent plasmonic oscillation; it absorbs in visible region as well acts as an electron trap. This process reduces the e−–h+ recombination. Here, we will discuss about TiO2 modification by metal nanoparticle with special emphasis on Au."
3,Effect of metal on photocatalytic H2 production,"2.2 Effect of metal on photocatalytic H2 production It is reported that the photochemical reduction depends on metal ion reduction potential and the location of conduction band level of semiconductor. For a feasible reduction process, conduction level should be comparatively more negative to that of reduction potential of the metal ion. Since the energy level of a semiconductor depends on pH of the medium, the feasibility of reduction of different metals becomes dependent on the pH of the electrolyte medium [35–37]. It was reported that at pH=7, reduction is feasible in case of transition metal like Ni, Cu, Ag, Au and Pd (reduction potentials are mentioned in the following equations). However, the H2 production is enhanced only in case of Pt, Pd, Au and Rh along with the reduction process. (4) Zn2++2e−⇄Zn E°=−0.7618V------------------------------- (5) Ni2++2e−⇄Ni E°=−0.257V---------------------- (6) Cu+2+2e−⇄Cu E°=0.3419V---------------------- (7) Rh3++3e−⇄Rh E°=0.758V----------------------- (8) Ag++e−⇄Ag E°=0.7996V------------------------ (9) Pd2++2e−⇄Pd E°=0.951V----------------------- (10) [AuCl4]−+3e−⇄Au+4Cl− E°=1.002V----------------- It is generally inferred that metal with high work function helps in enhancing the Schottky barrier effect, which in turn suppresses e−–h+ recombination. Usually metal after deposition on semiconductor surface exhibits movement of Fermi level towards more negative direction, which is a key factor for increasing Schottky barrier or efficiency of charge-transfer [38]. After light irradiation followed by electron transfer (TiO2 to M), Fermi level shift become more pronounced to facilitate further electron transfer as shown in Fig. 2. As we know, shift in fermi level further depends on work function of a metal. Thus, a metal with high work function is more suitable for photocatalytic H2 production. Work functions of Ag, Cu, Rh, Au and Pd are 4.26, 4.65, 4.98, 5.1 and 5.12eV, respectively. This ascending order is also observed for photocatalytic activity [39]. Amongst various nanometals, Au shows comparatively high photocatalytic activity under visible light due to its distinguishing features as mentioned in the following section."
4,Properties of Au nanoparticles (Au NPs),"2.3 Properties of Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) Au in the bulk form is inert and does not exhibit significant reactivity. In contrast Au NP shows very promising catalytic activity in specific reference to the oxidation of carbon monoxide. Highly disperse Au NPs are very difficult to achieve. Melting point of Au (1063°C) is considerably lower than that of Pt (1769°C) and Pd (1550°C) [40–42]. One interesting point to note is that Au NPs with a diameter of ~2nm exhibit a drastically reduced melting point of 300°C due to quantization effect [42,43]. Free space of face centered cubic lattice of Au is composed of three low index planes i.e. (110), (100) and (111). Amongst them, (100) and (111) have lower surface energy compared to (110), which generally supports the stability of the system. Schematics of the Au (100) (110) and (111) planes are shown in Fig. 3. Change in physical properties while going from bulk to nanogold is described on the basis of solid state chemistry. The reconstruction of (111) plane is only possible under ultra high vaccum (UHV) conditions. The structure obtained by reconstruction is composed of face-centered cubic and closed-packed hexagonal structures, in which 23 atoms are arranged in a space that is suitable for typically 22 atoms, thus surface energy of the system is lowered by squeezing in more atoms [44]. For a 2nm size Au particle the Au (110) planes can also be modified in UHV condition to form Au (111) plane in which 60% of the atoms are present over the surface. Smaller particle is having comparatively higher energy because of preponderance by free surface where unsaturated co-ordination bonds in the form of dangling bonds are present. Those states are energetically ahead of bulk Au. Decrease in particle size causes the electrons to occupy the surface of the particle in free unbound form. These unbound orbital or electron plays a crucial role in the manifestation of physical property of the particle as it traverses from bulk to nanoscale. As the particle size is diminished, band overlapping of valence electron also diminishes thus replacing it in the form of discrete energy level characteristics akin to molecular orbit. Outcome of this phenomenon unfolds in the form of decrease in conductivity and appearance of Mie plasmonic resonance as observed in case of Au55 and other smaller clusters. This phenomenon is not only dependent on particle size but is also influenced by the surrounding temperature and dielectric constant. At high temperature, metallic property is observed and vice-versa [45]. Incorporation of nano Au into TiO2 matrix for water splitting reaction has been extensively studied as it enhances the efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction and shifts the photo response towards the visible light regime due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [46,47]. Following section deals with the synthetic strategy adopted for the formation of TiO2:Au nanocompsite along with its resultant physical properties."
5,Synthesis of TiO2–Au nanocomposite,"In heterogeneous catalysis, influence of different parameters like particle size of catalyst and the support, percentage loading and interaction of the catalyst with the support does play a crucial role. Furthermore, influence of the Au reduction procedure affects the catalytic activity of the resulting TiO2 supported Au NPs. Effect of particle size on catalytic activity was first reported by Haruta and his group, and it was observed that the Au NPs exhibits photoactivity only when the particle size is below 20nm [48,49]. Several reports described linear dependence of Au NPs size on catalytic activity. The ratio of surface versus the total number of atoms is significantly influenced by increase in particle size. All these parameters directly deal with synthesis procedure for nanocomposite. In the following sub-sections various method to synthesize Au–TiO2 composites are described."
6,Chemical reduction method,"3.1 Chemical reduction method Reduction method is one of the simplest methods of Au NP deposition/adsorption over TiO2 surface. In terms of Au nanoparticle decoration, this technique is highly preferred for its availability as well established procedures for the preparation of colloidal suspensions in water and other solvents. Turkevich method [50] and Brust method [51] are well known methods for the synthesis of Au nanoparticles of ~5nm size with narrow size distribution. It can be done either in the presence or absence of solid supports like TiO2, It is usually observed that during adsorption process, Au tends to agglomerate, forming Au islands of particle size well above 50nm. In various photocatalytic processes, the activity of such catalyst is diminished due to reduced surface area and weak interaction with support. Naldoni et al. synthesized Au:TiO2 nanocomposite and studied these by optical, morphological and structural characterizations. TiO2:Au typically shows absorption at 549nm attributed to the SPR effect without altering the band gap of pure TiO2 [52]. It is also observed that reduction procedure of metal nanoparticle does not affect the morphology of TiO2. XPS investigation on Au:TiO2 nanocomposite did not reveal any spectral alteration even after sputtering with Ar+ ion for 1h. This indicates the stability of TiO2 matrix supported Au NPs opposite to that of TiO2:Pt nanocomposite. However, the size of Au NPs is bigger than that of Pt cluster. Chiarello et al. made Au:TiO2 composites and observed a 550nm SPR frequency which is about 20nm more than that observed for pure Au nanoparticles. The alteration of electronic configuration of Au due to the interaction with TiO2 support causes such a shift [53,54]. Comparative experimental condition is reported in Table 1 . Chemical reduction of Au salt in TiO2 was also performed when TiO2 is in the form of photonic crystal. The deposition of Au is significantly responsible for tuning the photonic band gap and subsequently hydrogen production [55]."
7,Sonochemical reduction method,"3.2 Sonochemical reduction method Sonochemical method for reduction is carried out in an ultra-sonication bath. This method is having an advantage as it is free from post synthesis treatments like washing and drying. This also enables deposition of metal nanoparticle on the support material [56,57]. Organic species breaks up into smaller fragments during sonolysis process. This then works as an initiator for metal salt reduction. Muzukoshi et al. successfully immobilized different metal nanoparticles on TiO2 surface by sonochemical method in presence of polyethylene glycol monostearate at an input power of 200W (6W/cm2) in 5–60min duration. Particle size estimated by TEM technique is around 14.3nm which is comparatively higher than Pt (2.1nm) and Pd (3.6nm) synthesized in similar manner [58]."
8,Dispersion method,"3.3 Dispersion method In terms of reproducibility and scaling up of this technique would show distinct advantages. As, it is also free from any kind of by-product formation. Jose et al. prepared Au:TiO2 composite by solvated metal dispersion method. Where Au in butadiene is added to TiO2 dispersion at high temperature under vacuum. After completion of metal deposition, the as-synthesized materials are further annealed at 200°C for the removal of butadiene [59]. Authors made a comparative study on Au particle size by varying TiO2 type (anatase, rutile and P25). Particle size is smaller in case of TiO2 anatase and rutile than that of P25 with λ max located at 536 and 560nm. However, Au incorporation normally does not affect band gap of any type of TiO2. Seh et al. described the synthesis of non centro-symmetric janus Au:TiO2 nanocomposite. Synthesis was carried out using titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in alcoholic–aqueous medium after dispersing Au50nm (synthesized by Brust method in toluene:water medium) particle at pH 9–10 and room temperature [60]. Jenus to core–shell morphology is controlled by just varying the concentration of TiO2 precursor from one to three times to that of the added Au salt amount. Jenus shaped nanocomposite shows comparatively higher red shift in plasmonic absorption band than core–shell morphology when compared with pure Au50nm in isopropyl alcohol. High refractive index of TiO2 causes this blue shift in Au absorption in core–shell morphology as in jenus shape some of the Au nanoparticles experience the effect of isopropyl-alcohol."
9,Photochemical deposition method,"3.4 Photochemical deposition method Besides adsorption of preformed Au colloids on to TiO2, an alternative that has been widely used to prepare titania supported Au NPs has been estabilized through photodeposition method. This methodology is valid when the support is a semiconductor such as TiO2. Irradiation of the semiconductor with light of appropriate wavelength produces the photogenerated electrons and holes. These electrons can be used to reduce Au salt to Au metal that will be simultaneously adsorbed on to the surface of the semiconductor. A hole scavenger such as an alcohol need to be present as such to avoid accumulation of positive charge during the photodeposition process. Deposition condition adopted by various research group is mentioned in Table 2 . Chen et al. consolidated the synthesis of Au:TiO2 nanocomposite by photochemical methods at 4.5 pH in 0.2N salt solutions of Na2CO3. In presence of TiO2, Au particle size does reduces from 20nm to 3nm. However, the corresponding SPR falls at 563nm with red shift of 30nm as compared to pure Au NPs [33]. Gartner et al. synthesized Au NPs in TiO2 matrix using different metal salts. High deposition is achieved by using NaAuCl4 (0.97wt%) followed by AuCl3 (0.96wt%), AuCl (0.65wt%) and [Au(PPh3)]Cl (almost 0). Although the average particle size remain almost same (3–12nm) in all these cases, in case of AuCl it was noted that there is some dilution observed on TiO2 surface in terms of Au concentration [61]. A comparative photodeposition process was carried out by Bamwenda et al. in alcoholic–aqueous solution of Au and Pt salts. Smaller particle size (1–8nm) with narrow size distribution could be achieved in case of Pt as compared to Au (1–10nm) [62]. Yuzawa et al. incorporated Au nanoparticle into TiO2 matrix by photochemical reduction process using different grades of TiO2. With 0.5wt% of Au loading, NP size of 11.5nm could be obtained. This exhibited nearly similar absorption spectra in all the cases indicating the same shape and size of the NPs. In case of TiO2-R3, there is a peak splitting at 2wt% Au loading and is explained as due to the formation of rod shaped particles. Hence, from different findings, the author has concluded that the growth of Au NPs take place faster on TiO2 of low surface area. Furthermore, growth rate of Au NPs is slower than that of agglomeration process because density of Au increase by varying the wt% of Au loading from 0.5 to 2 with this an increase in particle size from 11.3 to 25.3nm occurs in case of TiO-AR50 [63]. Gomathisanker et al. studied the metal NPs deposition over TiO2 with the aid of simultaneous H2 generation using light intensity of 5.0mW/cm2. Results reveal that, metal ion converted to metal NPs resulting in Fermi level shift towards more negative direction leading to Schottky energy barrier reduction. This barrier was found to be least in case of Pd followed by Au and Rh with the same trend of work function [37]. Confirmation of metal nanoparticle deposition came from absorption spectra in form of plasmonic absorption, however the absorption of TiO2 always shows a red shift in presence of Au and Pd. A. A. Melvin et al. studied the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency in both vis and UV–vis irradiation and found that electron transfer from Au to TiO2 was feasible under both irradiation. Although the catalyst did show a comparatively less activity in vis light [64]."
10,Deposition–precipitation method,"3.5 Deposition–precipitation method Deposition–precipitation method for the synthesis of Au:TiO2 nanocomposite, has proven to be the most feasible method adapted to heterogeneous catalysis. This is because it retains very small Au nanoparticles with an average particle size of about 5nm. The size is very suitable as the catalytic activity is most pronounced [65,66]. This methodology starts with the aqueous solution of HAuCl4, brought to the required pH level and followed by addition of TiO2 to this solution. Finally the resultant suspension is stirred continuously for a relatively longer time of 24h at a constant pH. The resultant solid is collected by proper washing to remove traces of Cl− ions. The crucial parameters involved in the deposition–precipitation process which control the particle size of Au NP is the pH value of the deposition step [67–69]. The deposition–precipitation method is a highly desirable technique due to the reproducibility of the quality of product. Synthesis procedure for nanocomposite fabrication is shown in Fig. 4. Catalysts made by this method are considered as “reference catalysts” type A and is considered for commercialization by World Gold Council. In order to achieve high photocatalytic activity and observe the influence of surface hydroxyl group, the acidic pH state is highly favorable. Such a processing condition is amenable to size regulation of NPs through reducing surface titanol group. Silva et al. synthesized TiO2 supported Au NPs by deposition precipitation technique by varying pH (4.5, 6 and 9) and temperature (200 and 400°C). Particle size can easily be controlled by adjusting the pH of the medium and heat treatment. Higher pH and temperature causes agglomeration due to the sintering occurring at Au and TiO2 interface. Smallest particle is formed by heating the composite at 200°C with pH around 9. Agglomeration at higher temperature is supported by absorption spectrum which reveals red shifting in the plasmonic absorption [70]. Rosseler et al. synthesized TiO2 by sol–gel method using different porogen like Polyethylene glycol (PEG), Polyoxyethylene (10) cetyl ether (Brij 56), Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and (10) cetyl ether (Brij 56) and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Au loading was carried out by an ion exchange procedure using HAuCl4. Ammonia (35vol%) was used for washing followed by calcinations at 300°C for 4h. Amongst all TiO2, TiO2 (Brij 56) posses highest surface area and least rutile phase content [34]. By changing wt% from 0.3 to 2wt%, the particle size was found to increase form 3nm to 8nm in all types of TiO2. Effect of Au on TiO2 is also maximum in case of TiO2 (Brij 56) in terms of its band gap. In XPS studies, no change in Ti peak position could be detected even the deposition of Au NPs. However, the peak related to oxygen in Ti-OH gets shifted towards higher binding energy side amounting to ~1eV because of strong interaction with Au. This happened due to strong ion-exchange of [Au (OH)4]− with TiOH."
11,Sol–gel method,"3.6 Sol–gel method This widely used technique adequately promotes chemical interaction between Au and TiO2. Oxy and hydroxyl bridges are formed between Au and TiO2 during the process of hydrolysis resulting form biphasic gel structure. Cihler et al. adopted sol gel technique for the dispersion of Au in TiO2. Hydrolysis was carried out using NH4OH followed by metal salt addition. A suspension of TiO2 precursor and metal salt was reduced by the addition of D-glucose. This process involves post-synthesis calcinations at 600°C for 6h. Due to mild reducing capability of D-glucose, the particle size of NPs is very small in case of Pt (1.8nm), Pd (2.1nm) and Au (3.3nm). Presence of metal nanoparticle favors the formation of anatase phase of TiO2 during calcinations with consequent reduction in surface area. This effect is most pronounced in case of Pt which has least effect in case of Au [71]. Fang et al. made Au:TiO2 composite by using AuCl3 and TiCl4 in gelation, where the gelating agent is a copolymer (pluoronic P123). Presence of copolymer enhances the surface area of TiO2 twice to that of pure TiO2. Moreover, the deposition of Au reduces the active surface area of TiO2 catalyst. Plasmonic absorption of TiO2–Au (590nm) is comparatively red shifted to that of pure Au (520–530nm) [72]. XPS also supports interaction between TiO2 and Au by showing some shift in Au binding energy towards higher value. Murdoch et al. reported synthesis of TiO2–Au nanocomposite and studied its effect of particle loading and size on the photocatalytic process [73]. Particle size increases to 3–12nm from 1–4nm by varying the wt% of Au loading. Growth of smaller particles are more feasible on high surface area anatase phase. Author also describes the effect of particle size on metal work function. Work function of Au is highest in case of smallest NP with size ~3nm. An Au:TiO2 nanocomposite configuration with 3nm size exhibit highest catalytic activity towards CO→CO2. Synthesis of TiO2–Au composite in presence of SiO2 template is also used for making yolk–shell morphology by etching of SiO2 by NaOH followed by annealing at different temperature. Heating was carried out to get different degree of crytallinity to investigate hydrogen production rate but also excited photo-electron lifetime [74]."
12,Photocatalytic hydrogen production under different irradiation,TiO2:Au based nanocomposite is opportune for photocatalytic activity in both UV–vis as well as visible light irradiation. Under different irradiation; site of excitation and redox reaction does varies. Following sub-section is formed according to the type of irradiation i.e. visible and UV–visible.
13,TiO2–Au activity in visible light,"4.1 TiO2–Au activity in visible light Two possible mechanism is described in the literature based on Au:TiO2 composite activity in visible region. In the first mechanism e−–h+ is separated at TiO2, however, second one deal with the electron transfer from Au to TiO2 due to the plasmonic effect of Au nanoparticle. The following subsection explains both mechanism based on the reports of various research group. 4.1.1 Electric near field effect mechanism Interaction between Au and Ag with a semiconductor leads to the formation of e−/h+ pairs in the semiconductor as shown in Fig. 5. Charge carrier generation is created by coupling between electromagnetic radiation and oscillation of electron in Au and Ag nanoparticle which causes strong-field enhancement more than incident light. Thus a resonance happened wavelength of incident light matches with the SPR band of Au or Ag in form of extra electron magnetic field to add up the light effect. Such enhanced field is nonhomogeneous and found to be highest at the place in semiconductor where metal nanoparticle presence is nearest. Probability of e−/h+ pairs recombination is very less when its formation takes place at the surface of the semiconductor rather than in the bulk. Apart from that the path length of charge carrier is also small to participate in the photocatalytic transformations [72,75]. Seh et al. made a comparative study of jenus and core–shell morphology of TiO2–Au nanocomposite in photocatalytic H2 generation process. Janus shaped morphology is more efficient for H2 generation due to larger near field enhancement at TiO2:Au interface, with larger particle size (70nm) than smaller one (30nm) [59]. Best finding of the author is the efficient applicability of amorphous TiO2 with Au nanoparticle because of the availability of discrete energy levels in the mobility gap which helps in the enhancement of plasmonic near field effect on TiO2 and reduces the recombination rate drastically. 4.1.2 Electron transfer (Au to TiO2) mechanism Electron transfer from Au to TiO2 under light irradiation is also an important phenomenon. As it effectively utilizes sun light due to strong plasmonic absorption of Au nanoparticle. However, there is the formation of Schottky barrier at the metal–semiconductor interface which does creates hindrances in electron movement, thus becoming unfavorable for charge separation [76–78]. Recent report describes such electron transfer process by multiple experimental evidences. It was found that Au nanoparticle work as a photo-sensitizer similarly like a dye molecule in dye sensitized solar cell thus support the possibility of Au to TiO2 electron transfer [79] as shown in Fig. 6. Silva et al. made TiO2–Au nanocomposite at low and high pH condition and calcined these at 200 and 400°C temperatures, respectively. In case of 200°C annealed TiO2–Au composite, catalytic activity is successively enhanced by increasing the pH. However, in case of 400°C annealed material, results are in contrast. Thus, not only the particle size but also some other factor control the catalytic activity. In terms of stability, 400°C annealed nanocomposite is photocatalytically more active than the one calcined at 200°C [70]. Photochemical O2 evolution also takes place on the same catalyst in the presence of Ag salt which works as an electron scavenging agent (transferred from Au to TiO2) and is reduced on TiO2 surface under visible light, thus supporting the mechanism. Resulting hole on Au NP is trapped by water and causes O2 evolution as confirmed from cyclic voltammetry which reveals a peak at −1.14V that is comparatively lower than 1.21V (thermodynamic oxidation potential for O2 evolution). Yzawa et al. made comparison between different TiO2 (A50, AR50, A300, R3, R100)–Au nanocomposites for photocatalytic H2 generation. Some of the TiO2 show initial induction time due to requirement of initial reduction process prior to onset of photocatalysis. All the categories of TiO2 show the effect of Au loading on H2 evolution rate. In all the cases, it decreases with increase in Au loading. However R3 shows opposite trend due to the formation of rod shaped Au NP. In terms of amount of H2 generation or rate of H2 evolution A50 is more efficient catalyst with same Au loading of 0.25wt%. Thus it can be inferred that plasmonic absorption or absorbity is the main factor affecting H2 generation rate. H2 generation follow a similar trend to that of increasing anatase content as A50>AR50>A300>R3>R100. A50 TiO2 although have the least surface area, shows high activity due to larger particle size. Certainly, reduction in the recombination rate is the reason [63]. Melvin et al. studied the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency in both Vis and UV–vis irradiation and found that catalyst active (comparatively less) in Vis light [64] which support electron transfer from Au to TiO2."
14,Activity in UV and UV–vis region,"4.2 Activity in UV and UV–vis region In UV only one side electron transfer (from TiO2 to Au) is possible, however, in case of UV–vis a two side (from TiO2 to Au and Au to TiO2) electron transfer can occur [32] as shown in Fig. 7. Researchers explain mechanism of nanocomposite activity by either/or and both of the electron transfer pathway. Murdoch et al. reports the effect of anatase and rutile phase on photocatalytic H2 generation. In case of anatase phase, H2 generation increase with the increase in Au loading from 1–4wt% (3–12nm). However, beyond that i.e. at 8wt% it decreases due to much larger size of Au (26nm) NP. Author suggested a mechanism based on ethoxide formation on TiO2 followed by consumption of hole and formation of OH species along with acetaldehyde. OH species consumes electron and generates H2 in comparatively higher rate than that observed for Pt and Pd at same loading [73]. Cihalar et al. compared Ti oxide–hydroxide and TiO2 nanocomposite with metal nanoparticles for H2 generation and reported that TiO2 nanocomposite is more efficient for this purpose due to proper degradation of organic species and OH groups from the surface during heat treatment process at 600°C. Amongst, Pt, Pd and Au, Pt based nanocomposite catalyst showed highest activity under UV–vis irradiation. Further photocatalytic activity is enhanced by increasing the light intensity. However, under visible light, its activity is comparatively poor [71]. Chen et al. confirmed in their experiment that Au NP not only works as an electron sink during photocatalysis but also provides active surface site for the reaction. Thus the effect of SPR is not much responsible for enhanced H2 production vide UV–vis irradiation. Effect of different shape on photocatalytic activity is further justified by simulation studies which state that half embedded nanoparticle is more efficient in making the effect of plasmonic induced enhancement on absorption by TiO2 [33]. Bamwenda et al. first compared Pt and Au composite followed by different technique used for the synthesis of TiO2–Au nanocomposite and showed that Pt is more efficient than Au in terms of H2/CO2 ratio. However, CO2/CH4 is higher in case of Au composites and amongst different technique of synthesis (photodeposition, deposition precipitation, imprementation and simple mixing) photodeposition yield׳s highest H2 evolution rate. In deposition–precipitation technique, the temperature used for reduction plays a crucial role in photocatalysis. Low temperature synthesized materials are more active than high temperature synthesized materials due to more amount of anatase phase [62]. Mizukoshi et al. describes photocatalytic H2 generation using TiO2–MNP (Pt, Pd and Au) nanocomposite with the same loading amounts and it was found that H2 generation is highest in case of Pt based nanocomposite followed by Pd and Au [58]. This difference could be due to difference in work function value and size of the metal nanoparticle. Moreover the authors conclude that ultrasonic method for metal deposition is better in terms of photocatalysis than simple impregnation method due to uniform dispersity and strong metal support interaction obtained. Naldoni et al. described the effect of Au and Pt loading on TiO2 on H2 and CO2 generations and it was reported that both of the products formed in higher amounts in case of Pt nanocomposite for Au. In all these studies, TiO2 treated with NaBH4 was considered as a reference. The efficiency of different catalysts is further proved by ESR technique by monitoring the signal of O− and O 2 − formed by hole and electron trapping by O 2 − and O 2 . . Signal of O− is highest in case of Pt than Au nanocomposite due to smaller size. However O 2 − signal is weak in Pt under either vacuum or O2 saturated solution with UV–vis irradiation. O 2 − signal also does not get enhanced in typical visible light irradiation condition which indicates that SPR absorption does not contribute to its activation in case of TiO2–Au nanocomposites [52]. Effect of metal loading in case of Au is varied from 1–2wt%. However in case of Pt it is in the range of 0.3–1wt%. There is no effect of surface area on the photocatalytic activity as seen in the case of Pt. This is opposite to the case of Au, where changing Au wt% changes size of Au nanoparticle drastically. Comparative hydrogen production (reported by different research group) along with reaction parameter is given in Table 3. Photocatalysis is more active in the pH range 4–7 and least in the case of basic media. Gartner et al. described the effect of different metal salt of Au and sacrificial agents on photocatalytic activity towards H2 generation. It was found that NaAuCl4·2H2O and methanol combination is most efficient amongst AuCl3, AuCl, and Au[(PPh3)]Cl as salts, whereas, glycerin, iprOH, glucose and methanol as sacrificial agents [61]. Further isotopic studies reveals that methanol reforming is not a rate determining step, the water reduction process is affected by deuteration of methanol (–CH3) hydrogen. Fang et al. carried out several control experiment to justify the existence of two mechanism i.e. electron transfer from TiO2 to Au and vice versa. To see the effect of electron transfer from Au to TiO2 a comparison between TiO2–Au and TiO2–Pt was made and found that photocatalytic activity is high in case of TiO2–Au in comparison to TiO2–Pt under visible light irradiation. Amongst TiO2, TiO2 derived from P123 and P25, Au nanocomposite with P123 was more affected by plasmonic effect due to sublevel present just below the conduction band due to defect. To justify the electron transfer from Au to TiO2 author studied the wavelength effect on photocatalytic activity and it was found that of 550nm, H2 generation was less than that at 500nm irradiation. This is because maximum absorption distribution occurs at 500nm. Rosseler et al. synthesized TiO2 by sol–gel method using different porogen like Polyethylene glycol (PEG), Polyoxyethylene (10) cety ether (Brij 56), Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and (10) cetyl ether (Brij 56) and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Au loading was carried out by an ion exchange procedure using HAuCl4. Ammonia (35vol%) was used for washing followed by calcinations at 300°C for 4h. Amongst all TiO2, TiO2 (Brij 56) possess highest surface area and least rutile phase content [34]. By changing wt% from 0.3 to 2wt%, the particle size was found to increase form 3nm to 8nm in all types of TiO2. Effect of Au on TiO2 is also maximum in case of TiO2 (Brij 56) in terms of its band gap. In XPS studies, no change in Ti peak position could be detected even the deposition of Au NPs. However, the peak related to oxygen in Ti-OH gets shifted towards higher binding energy side amounting to ~1eV because of strong interaction with Au. This happened due to strong ion-exchange of [Au(OH)4]- with TiOH. Gomathisankar et al. found positive effect of glucose concentration in the medium both in the case of Pd (comparatively more) and Au for H2 evolution rate. However, by increasing metal salt concentration, H2 evolution rate decreases due to light filteration by NPs. Also the blockage is increased by particle over TiO2 surface. Increase activity from TiO2<TiO2–Au<TiO2–Pd is due to decreasing band gap trend [37]. Mechanism is based on the hole consumption by glucose. However, electron gets consumed by water molecule to form CO2 and H2."
15,Other phenomenon during photocatalytic H2 generation,"4.3 Other phenomenon during photocatalytic H2 generation Chiarello et al. studied the evolution rate of different components during photocatalytic process and fitted it for three mechanism i.e. direct path (hole consumption by methanol), indirect path (hole consumption by OH) and lastly water assisted path (hole-methanol interaction in bulk water medium) for Pt (0.5)/TiO2 and Au (1)/TiO2 nanocomposite. In both the composites, formic acid and formaldehyde first increased and then decreased with the increase in methanol content in the mixture. However, CO2 concentration continuously decreased [53]. This states that high methanol concentration mechanistically supports indirect path and this diminishes due to low probability of hole interaction with water. However, indirect path also has some benefits like selectivity for CO2 and occurs only at strong adsorption sites and can work at very low concentration of methanol. Chiarello et al. studied TiO2:Au nanocomposite in methanol reforming process. It was found that high concentration of water in water:methanol mixture, H2 generation takes place by the formation of acetic acid and acetaldehyde [54]. It was found that selectivity rate of H2 generation is higher in case of Pt than Au based nanocomposite with same loading and it is also accompanied with least selectivity for CO formation. Role of water in photocatalysis is further proved by anaerobic oxidation of formic acid with varying amount of H2O. Both H2 and CO2 production are enhanced by increasing the amount of water. Due to availability of more amount of OH, which reacts with HCOOH, along with the valence band hole and results in conversion to CO2, the electron trapped by water molecule becomes available for H2 generation. Excited electron lifetime was estimated by photoluminescence dynamics at short wavelength excitation (266 and 300nm) and it was found that it increases with increase in crystallinity of the TiO2–Au composite, however at higher wavelength, no discernable effect of crystallinity was observed [74]. Presence of Au further helps in tuning the photonic band gap of TiO2, when it is in the photonic crystal form. Photonic band gap is responsible for increasing the path length of photon in the TiO2 matrix responsible for strong absorption of light. Waterhouse et al. tuned the photonic band gap of TiO2 by changing Au wt% and found that the most highly efficient catalyst have a photonic band gap of 357nm [55]."
16,Conclusion,"It is well described that Au present at the surface of TiO2 tends to form stable metal composites which enhances the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 in visible as well as UV–vis region. Preparation of TiO2 nanocomposite is well described in literature in terms of its wt% loading and particle size. From a fundamental point of view, studies on surface and interface aspects of Au:TiO2 nanocomposite will enrich the existing knowledge base. For appropriate correlation with photocatalytic activity and to enable reproducibility, it is desired that all aspect of surface and interface characterization be carried out in order to bring out linkage with functional properties. Exercise based on structural and spectroscopic investigation will certainly quantify the results, besides establishing appropriate material parameters. This will certainly go a long way in satisfying mankind dream of harvesting the inexhaustible energy supply i.e. H2. However, the photo action spectrum or effect of different wavelength on photocatalysis needs to be correlated well with the plasmonic absorption of Au nanoparticles. There still remains a void in the synthesis procedure involved in the synthesis of TiO2–Au with optimum properties in regard to its wt% loading, particle size and size distribution. There is a scope for combination of Au with other metals for making more efficient catalyst with thermal activity especially for H2 generation. It will be synergistically more suitable to be used for waste water containing organic species where organic species will work as sacrificial hole scavenger while enhancing green energy aspiration. Thus TiO2–Au is of current interest in determining its photocatalytic activity."
