0,Introduction,"Oxidation reactions are of particular importance in organic synthesis and widely used in industrial processes in order to the preparation of a variety of chemicals [1]. Among, oxidation of alcohols, as a cheapest starting materials, to aldehydes and carboxylic acids is very valuable [2]. Carboxylic acids as valuable organic chemicals, have countless applications in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals from both academic and industrial points of view [3]. One example is the process of metal-catalyzed carbonylation of methanol to form acetic acid [4]. Aldehydes, also useful intermediates in organic synthesis that can be utilized as a precious building blocks for the construction of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals [5]. Different approaches have been developed for efficient oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and/or carboxylic acids, which can be point to: lactase-mediator system [6], supported Pt/Bi [7], supported Au [5], Pd catalyst [1], PdBiTe/C (PBT/C) catalyst [8], TEMPO/DAIB [TEMPO = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl, DAIB=(diacetoxy)iodobenzene] [9], AgNHC complex [10], Fe(NO3)3/TEMPO [11], NHC-ruthenium catalyst [12], Ru PNP pincer complexes [13] were some oxidation systems that have been reported recently for oxidation of primary alcohol to carbonyl compounds. Also, the transformation of alcohol to carbonyls could be conduct to direct preparation of imine and oxime in the presence of an amine [14]. Due to their high reactivity, imines and oximes are an important class of nitrogen-containing compounds, and are also key intermediates in multi-component reactions, preparation of asymmetric organocatalysis, cross-dehydrogenative couplings, etc. [15], which are used for organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals [16]. So, synthesis of imines or oximes with different functionality, potential versatility and wide scope of applications are essentially ever-appealing matter in chemistry. On the other hand, low price, green nature, availability and variety of alcohols (than aldehydes) have been made the one-pot oxidation tandem coupling of alcohol and amine into imine, to one of the most popular methods, rather than the traditional method, i.e. condensation reaction of aldehydes or ketones with amines [10]. Several new methods have been developed in recent years either by a homogeneous or heterogeneous catalyst in this area such as: ruthenium PNP pincer complex [17], Co PNP complex [18], CeO2 [16], Au/HAP (Gold Supported on Hydroxyapatite) [2], TOMRh(CO)2 [19], CuClO4·4H2O [20], Pd-catalyst/TEMPO [21], Pt@TiO2 [15], CuI/2,2′-bipyridineTEMPO [21], PdAlO(OH) [22], CeO2-5 [23], CuI/ligand [24], Ru/AC [25], [Ru(η6-p-cymene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 [3] and MnO2/graphene oxide [26]. The main impediments for the reported oxidative transformation of alcohols to carbonyls, carboxylic acids and imines are the use of expensive, non-economic, stoichiometric toxic oxidations with expensive transition metals that may generate a notable amount of (salt) waste along with toxicity problems. Also, most of them are limited to activated (benzylic) alcohols and leads to the formation of undesirable products. To now, many attempts have been regularly investigated to introduction of new cleaner and ecofriendly catalytic oxidation approaches by using less toxic metal catalysts and molecular oxygen or air as oxidant [22–25]. However, contrary to various progresses, many of them still suffer from harsh and tedious reaction conditions, high costs, long reaction times, operational complexity, functional group incompatibility, production of un-processable and metal-containing wastes causing significant environmental concerns, poor atom efficiency, and instability. Moreover, selectivity for most of them could not be controlled, because oxidation of an alcohol leads to different oxidation products [27]. Hence, there is a continuing demand to develop a more sustainable and environmentally benign and selective oxidation processes that could be prevail the mentioned drawbacks. Potential of the Mn-based catalysts for oxidation and epoxidation of organic compounds have been widely studied and known for decades. Manganese metal can adopt a wide variety of oxidation states in the range 2 + to 5+ [28]. This behavior made Mn catalysts as a pivotal redox catalyst for oxygen transfer approaches. Furthermore, Mn complexes have lower toxicity and low cost compare to the other transition metal complex systems, which has attracted a lot of attention for oxidation purposes. Various reports have been appeared on Mn-base catalysts which are able to catalyze the oxidation of alcohols with high efficiency [28–32]. However, very few reports for Mn-catalyzed cross coupling of alcohols with amines or hydroxyl amine are available [14,33,34]. In this work we successfully functionalized the Fe3O4@SiO2 core-shell NPs with melamine- Mn(III) Schiff base complex as a novel heterogeneous magnetically recoverable nanocatalyst for general, efficient, environmentally benign and selective transformation of primary and secondary alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds in the presence of H2O2. Also, direct transformation of alcohol to carboxylic acid have been accomplished through a different route by O2. To extent of versatility of the present method, one pot oxidation tandem coupling of alcohol and amine was performed by this approach with high yields. The presence of imidazolium part in the catalyst provide an additional functionality that could be accomplish the oxidation in absence of any metal site. In this point of view, it plays a synergetic effect, which studied in this paper. Reaction mechanisms were deeply investigated. Also, chemo-selectivity behavior of the system was thoroughly studied in this article."

11,Results and discussion,
12,Characterization of catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of catalyst Elemental analyses for the samples were tabulated in Table 1 . The results were in good agreement with the theoretical calculations and confirmed the preparation of 2-Hydroxy-5-chloromethyl benzaldehyde (1), 2-hydroxy-5-imidazole benzaldehyde (2), 3 and 4. Also, the results were in accordance with the proposed structure sketched in Scheme 2. Fig. 1 shows the FTIR spectra of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 compounds. The FTIR absorption spectra of 1, shows two characteristic peaks at 1481 cm−1 and 725 cm−1 correspond to the methylene groups (CH2 ) in m-substitution and stretching vibration of CCl group respectively (Fig. 1a) [14]. The FTIR spectrum of 2 shows a series of peaks at 2490-2780 cm−1 related to the imidazole moiety in agreement with compounds bearing imidazole moieties reported in the literature (Fig. 1b) [38]. Moreover, elimination of CCl bond at 725 cm−1 in the spectrum of 2 corroborates the imidazolium functionalization of 5-chloromethylene salicylaldehyde. Stretching vibration related to the NH of imidazole moiety was appeared at 3413 cm−1. Imine formation of 3 was confirmed by presence of imine bond at 1611 cm−1 (Fig. 1c) [27]. This absorption was shifted to 1563 cm−1 due to Mn complex formation. This red shift along with MnO and MnN stretching vibrations at 504 cm−1 and 615 cm−1 respectively, confirmed the successful coordination of Mn ions through N and O in 4 (Fig. 1d). Fe3O4 NPs showed a single characteristic peak at 570 cm−1 related to FeO bond [39] (Fig. 1e). The presence of three main peaks at 779, 1072 and 3433 cm−1 correspond to stretching vibrations of FeO, SiOSi (Symm.) and SiOSi (Asymm.) respectively, that strongly confirm the coating of Fe3O4 NPs by silica shells (Fig. 1f) [40]. Fig. 1g demonstrated the vibrations attributed to CH Str., CH2 Bend. and CCl Str. at ∼2920, 1458, 633 cm−1, respectively, that strongly confirmed the preparation of Fe3O4@SiO2 Cl (Fig. 1g). Incorporation of complex 4 on Fe3O4@SiO2 Cl was proved by the presence of CN, SiOSi, FeO, CC correspond to the wavenumbers at 1560 cm−1, 1018 cm−1, 405 cm−1 and 1414 cm−1. Fig. 1i shows the spectrum of Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex nanocomposite (9) and clearly confirming the intercalation of melamine between the 8 compounds and consequently preparation of the nanocomposite 9. Loading amount of Mn on the catalyst was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) as well as ICP instruments due to more ensure attainment. The results for the two analyses were close to each other with few difference (0.008). The experiments indicated that 1.25 mmol of Mn metal per gram of the catalyst (1.25 mmol g−1) was loaded on the catalyst framework 9. Also, the analyses give the percentage of the heavy metals as: 45.74 %w, 2.22 %w, 6.80 %w for Fe, Si, Mn respectively. XRD spectra for the synthesized nanoparticles were shown in Fig. 2 . As presented in Fig. 2, Fe3O4 nanoparticles have highly crystalline cubic inverse spinel structure in agreement well with the standard Fe3O4 (cubic phase) XRD spectrum (PDF#88-0866). The characteristic diffraction peaks at 2Ɵ = 30.1, 35.4, 43.1, 53.4, 57 and 62.6, which were marked respectively by their indices (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440) (reference JCPDS card no. 19-629) (Fig. 2a–d) demonstrated the inverse spinel structure of Fe3O4 NPs and were also observed for Fe3O4@SiO2, Fe3O4@SiO2 Cl and Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III) complex nanocomposite [37]. This, manifested that the surface modification of the Fe3O4 NPs does not lead to their phase change or structure. The XRD pattern of Fe3O4@SiO2 and Fe3O4@SiO2 Cl shows an obvious diffusion peak at 2Ɵ = 15–25° represent the coated amorphous silica on Fe3O4 NPs (Fig. 2b and c). XRD pattern of Fe3O4@SiO2@Mn(III) complex (8) as well as Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III) complex nanocomposite is contain silica as well as Fe3O4 peaks in their corresponding 2θ with amorphous appearance (Fig. 2d and e). The compound 8 represents an amorphous peak at 2θ = 25° that may be attributed to the incorporation of Mn(III)-Schiff base complex on the Fe3O4@SiO2 core-shell NPs [41]. The broadening of the peaks shows that Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs functionalized with amorphous melamine-Mn(III) Schiff base complex and revealed the successfully preparation of the nanocomposite 9. The broad peak at 2θ = 22° was assigned to amorphous melamine-Mn(III) Schiff base complex (Fig. 2e). This broad peak was transferred to lower angles than the corresponding amorphous peak for compound 8. This shift is due to the synergetic effect of Mn(III)Schiff base complex as well as melamine that is incorporated into the catalyst framework [42]. Beside of other analyses, size of nanoparticles was calculated using Scherrer's equation: D = Kγ/β cosθ, where K is a constant (K = 0.9 for Cu-Kα), D is the average diameter in °A, β is the broadening of the diffraction line measured at half of its maximum intensity in radians, γ is the wavelength of the X-rays and θ is the Bragg diffraction angle. The crystalline size of the Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III) complex nanoparticles was calculated to be around 53 nm using the equation. XPS spectrum survey of the Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III) complex nanocomposite was shown in Fig. 3 a and revealed the surface chemical compositions as well as valence state of the elements. Fig. 3a shows the overall survey spectrum of Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III) complex nanocomposite in which the peaks corresponding to Mn 3p (48.5 eV), Mn 3s (84.2 eV), Si 2p (105.3 eV), Si 2s (149.8 eV), Cl 2p (199.2 eV), C 1s (284.9 eV), N 1s (401.5 eV), O 1s (532.2 eV), Mn 2p3/2 (642.5 eV), Mn 2p1/2 (653.6 eV), Fe 2p (712.1 eV) are clearly observed. The presence of elements such as Mn, C, Si and N indicating that Fe3O4 core was completely covered by SiO2 shell and Mn(III) Schiff base complex. The high resolution XPS spectrum was used to investigate the oxidation state, and the binding energy of the core electron of the Mn metal (Fig. 3b). The Mn2p spectrum presented two peaks with binding energies of 653.6 eV and 642.5 eV related to Mn2p1/2 and Mn2p3/2, respectively. Magnitude of peak splitting is 11.1 eV, which confirmed that Mn ions are +3 in valence state [27]. The elements in the catalyst was probed by EDX and given in Fig. 3c. The results were completely in agreement with the XPS analysis of the catalyst and confirmed successfully immobilization of the Mn(III) Schiff base complex on Fe3O4@SiO2 Cl nanoparticles. CV and DPV profiles of the Mn(III) Schiff base complex 4 and Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex nanocomposite 9 versus SCE at scan rate of 100 mVs−1 are exhibited near symmetric redox cycles between 0 and 1.6V (Fig. 4 A, B). As shown in Fig. 4A, the CV experiments are characterized by two reversible redox couples and determined the electro activity and stability of the complexes. The two oxidation processes at ∼0.63 V and 1.42 V were assigned to oxidation of Mn(II) to Mn(III) and Mn(III) to Mn(IV) for the Mn(III) Schiff base complex (4). As evident from Fig. 4A-b, two reduction peaks were also appeared at 0.30 V and 1.34 V can be attributed to reduction of Mn(IV) to Mn(III) and Mn(III) to Mn(II) respectively. Same redox behavior was observed for Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex nanocomposite. The anodic and cathodic peaks current of the catalyst was found to be 0.72 V, 1.37 V (Eac) and 0.43 V, 1.30 V (Epc). This behavior exhibits that the catalyst provide faster electron transfer kinetics and larger electroactive surface area compared to Mn(III) Schiff base complex 4 and was in agreement with the literature [43]. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) that is a technique much more sensitive than cyclic voltammetry [44,45], shows a more precise the redox potential of the redox process and provided further support for the reversible redox behavior of the Mn complexes 4 and 9 (Fig. 4B). DPV clearly confirms the reversible couples for Mn(III) Schiff base complex 4 and Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex nanocomposite 9 from cyclic voltammetry. The quasi-reversible couples seen in the CV appears here with a current similar to the reversible couples, but with a smoothly and sharpened peak (Fig. 4B). VSM analyses for Fe3O4, Fe3O4@SiO2, and Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III) complex nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 4C. These NPs exhibited high permeability in magnetization and good magnetic responsiveness, which their magnetization was sufficient in order to separation with an external magnetic field. The magnetization and demagnetization curves are coincident and did not any hysteresis phenomenon was found. As shown in Fig. 4C, the remanent magnetization is equal to zero for all NPs. Magnetic measurements show saturation magnetization values of 70.0, 39.8 and 35.9 emu/g for Fe3O4, Fe3O4@SiO2, and Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III) complex nanocomposite, respectively (Fig. 4C-a,b,c). The results demonstrated that the magnetization of Fe3O4 decreased considerably due to coated silica-shell and Schiff base Mn complex on its surface (Fig. 4C-b,c). Nevertheless, Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex nanocomposite exhibited the superparamagnetic characteristic and a high magnetization value, which can be readily separated from the mixture by a simple external magnet. The morphology and structure of the Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex nanocomposite were also observed using TEM (Fig. 4D). The TEM image reveals that the catalyst having well shaped spherical or ellipsoidal particles. The diameter of the nanoparticles is found to be approximately 60 nm. According to FE-SEM images, the synthesized Fe3O4 NPs and Fe3O4@SiO2 are nearly spherical in shape and well dispersed; although in some areas bigger structures with non-spherical morphology are observed (Fig. 5 a and b). The Fe3O4 and Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles have an average diameter of 10–12 nm and 20–22 nm respectively (Fig. 5a and b), consistence with their DLS analyses (Fig. 5d and e). Fig. 5c showing FE-SEM image of Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex nanocomposite with near-spherical morphology. After successive coating with Schiff base Mn complex, these composites still maintain their spherical shape with an average diameter of ∼59 nm (Fig. 5d). The size distribution of these NPs were centered at a value of 12, 20 and 59 nm for Fe3O4, Fe3O4@SiO2 and Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex nanocomposite, respectively (Fig. 5d–f), and were in agreement with the particle sizes exhibited in SEM images. Specific surface area and porosity of the samples were investigated by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm analysis. The specific surface area values, the average pore diameter (according to BJH method) and total pore volume are tabulated in Table 2 . According to the BET isotherm, the active surface area of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@SiO2, Fe3O4@SiO2 Cl, Fe3O4@SiO2 Mn(III)-Schiff base complex (8) and Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex nanocomposite 9 was determined as 480, 455, 400, 386 and 375 m2/g, respectively (Table 2)."
13,Optimization studies,"3.2 Optimization studies Initially, oxidation of benzyl alcohol was chosen as model reaction in order to finding optimum conditions interfered in the reaction. These parameters were solvent, oxidant and catalyst amount. 3.2.1 Effect of solvent Did not use any solvent for alcohol oxidation to aldehyde/ketone. We investigated solvent effect on oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid. As shown in Fig. 6 a, solvent had a promising role for this oxidation case. According to the radical proposed mechanism that will be discussed later, when the solvent polarity is increased causes to solvation of the polar transition state for the propagation reaction and the reaction conversion is increased. Due to polar effect of electron-withdrawing functional groups (nitro, cyano, and carboxyl) in solvents such as CH3CN, NO2CH3, acetic acid, they would be inert to peroxy radical attack and provide high conversion and selectivity than solvents such as DEE and THF. These solvents provide complications from co-oxidation and delay the oxidation [46–48]. 3.2.2 Effect of oxidant The oxidation of benzyl alcohol was investigated with different oxidants (Fig. 6b). All of oxidants cause to benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde except O2 and NaOCl. As we discussed in following, molecular oxygen, as an oxygen source, support a radical mechanism. High selectivity and conversion was achieved by H2O2. Next, H2O2/urea provides same conversion with a lower selectivity. On the other hand, molecular oxygen and NaOCl proceeded the oxidation to benzoic acid. NaOCl provides lower efficiencies; it may be due to radical side reactions concerning with NaOCl [27]. The model reaction was performed in various concentration of H2O2 as an oxidant. The results indicated that there is no effect of the concentration of the oxidant on the model reaction (†ESI, Table S1). 3.2.3 Effect of mol% of catalyst The effect of catalyst amount on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and benzoic acid are presented in Fig. 6c. The reaction was performed with different amounts of 9 in the presence of O2 (for oxidation to benzoic acid) or H2O2 (for oxidation to benzaldehyde) at room temperature. The observations were clearly proved the effectiveness of the catalyst for oxidation of the compounds. It was observed that the conversion increases with an increase in the amount of the catalyst to 0.25 for oxidation to benzoic acid in the presence of O2 and 0.5 mol% for oxidation to benzaldehyde in the presence of H2O2. Larger quantities of manganese did not show considerably influence under the chosen conditions and did not provide more efficiency for the reactions. Selectivities are independent to catalyst amount and they remain constant during variation of the catalyst mol% (98% for benzoic acid and 99% for benzaldehyde)."
14,Catalytic oxidation of alcohols to imine and/or oxime and one-pot preparation of carboxylic acid from alcohol using Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex nanocomposite,"3.3 Catalytic oxidation of alcohols to imine and/or oxime and one-pot preparation of carboxylic acid from alcohol using Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex nanocomposite The utility of the Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex for oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and to carboxylic acids, oxidation of alcohols to imine and to oxime in the presence of amine or NH2OH·HCl was tested with a wide range of substrates (Scheme 3 , Tables 3 and 4 ). Various benzylic and aliphatic alcohols, were subjected to the reaction conditions. In most cases, a high yield of the oxidation products was achieved. The scope is included electron rich and deficient alcohols derivatives, primary and secondary alcohols, aromatic and aliphatic alcohols, most of which underwent efficient oxidation in excellent yield (>90%) (Scheme 3, Tables 3 and 4). Direct preparation of imines or oximes was afforded by a variety of primary benzylic alcohols in the presence of amines or hydroxyl amine hydrochloride catalyzed by Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex nanocomposite in H2O2 at room temperature (Scheme 3 and Tables 3 and 4). High to excellent yields and selectivities was obtained for all of the compounds. The system demonstrated well performance for the preparation of salen-type ligands (Table 3, 12c, 12d, 12h) in the presence of a diamine and two equivalent of alcohol, and bis-imine compounds (Table 3, 12i, 12l) with excellent yields. An interesting result was the preparation of the heavy-bulky tetra-imines (Table 3, 12j, 12k) by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine with high yields using the present method. However, the products with some unreacted amino groups were also observed for two entries 12j, 12k. Oxime as well as imine derivatives were prepared using the Mn-catalyzed oxidation system in H2O2 in quantitative yields (Table 4). Both, electron rich and electron deficient aromatic rings operated well with this method. The possibility of the formation of oxime and/or aldehyde were examined in the presence of molecular O2 catalyzed by Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex. As will be discussed at “mechanism studies” section, O2 promotes a radical mechanism causes alcohol oxidation to proceeds to benzoic acid. The oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol in CH3CN catalyzed by Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex gives 13% imine product (1-diphenylmethanimine) for 5 h. The major product was benzoic acid. Surprisingly, the experiment gives 76% imine in the presence of hydroquinone as a radical scavenger. An explanation for this phenomenon may be related to the more radical formation rate than the formation of an amine. In addition, in accordance with the mechanism shown in Scheme 5 , the acid (H+) produced during the reaction can also be contribute to the imine hydrolysis and is responsible for the low efficiency observed for the imine product (Scheme 5). The efficiency of the oxidation to aldehyde is depends on the nature of the substituents on the aromatic ring. Donor-substituted benzylic alcohols gave the corresponding alcohols in good to excellent yields, whereas acceptor-substituted provided lower efficiencies (Table 5 , 15c, 15e, 15h, 15i, 15m). The best results were obtained with alcohols with –N(Me)2 15g and –OMe 15d substituents. Efficiency was dropped for oxidation of 1,4-benzenedimethanol 15h. It is believed that the formation of the first carbonyl group on the ring causes the ring to be deactivated and therefore, slow down the oxidation for the second group on the ring. The same phenomenon can also be responsible for its low selectivity. Mn-catalyzed oxidation of primary benzylic alcohol to carboxylic acid in the presence of O2 didn't show any remarkable substitute effect. All substrates were efficiently transformed to acid with high to excellent yields (Table 5, 14a-m). Also, the method shows an excellent selectivity whether for acid or aldehyde and there is not any considerable oxidation by-product (Table 5, †ESI, Tables. S2, S3). These results illustrate that the direct oxidation of alcohol to acid pass another route, where the substitute plays a very poor role in efficiency. Aliphatic alcohols reacted poorly (17a-d, 18a-d), but good efficiency was achieved for cinnamaldehyde 18d and cinnamic acid 17d (Table 6 ). Secondary alcohols represented lower efficiency than their corresponding primary type. Nevertheless, moderate efficiency was obtained for aromatic substrates. It seems additional substituent in secondary alcohol cause to steric effect and consequently causes to lack of suitable interaction between the substrate and the catalyst (as a macromolecule) and requires a longer reaction time relative to primary alcohol. On the other hand, according to the proposed mechanism in the next section, secondary alcohol provides more stable carbocation and thus acts in the opposite direction and prevent excessive loss of efficiency due to the effects of steric hindrance. Oxidation of some secondary alcohol to ketone was shown in Table 7 . In order to demonstrate the effect of melamine in the catalyst 9, the reaction of benzyl alcohol with O2 as well as H2O2 was carried out in the presence of 20 mg and 40 mg of compound 8 respectively, under identical reaction conditions used for 9 (Table 5, entry 14a, 15a). Oxidation of alcohol in the presence of molecular oxygen afforded 88% benzoic acid conversion for 8 h. However, the yield of the reaction reached to 89% after 12 h. No change in selectivity was observed. This experiment was also applied for oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol in the presence of H2O2 catalyzed by 8. The reaction afforded 90% benzaldehyde conversion for 4 h. However, a small drop in selectivity was observed in this case (94%). The results indicated the nanocomposite 9 is obviously superior to the compound 8. Intercalation of melamine to this system provides a robust-rigid network structure with an enhance in selectivity and efficiency."
15,Mechanism studies,"3.4 Mechanism studies A typical mechanism for direct preparation of oxime and imine from alcohol catalyzed by Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III) complex in the presence of hydrogen peroxide have been shown in Scheme 4. The mechanism could be generalized for other oxidants except molecular oxygen. Various mechanisms for Mn(III)-catalyzed oxidation of alcohol by peroxide have been reported in literature [27,49–52]. However, in accordance with our observations (effect of oxidant and substituent) a carbocation mechanism is plausible for this transformation. Previously, Saffar-Teluri reported a mechanism for alcohol oxidation by Mn(III)-salophen, where in first, manganese salophen transferred to the manganese-oxo intermediate in the presence of NaIO4 [51]. This transformation was shown for Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III) complex in the presence of H2O2 in Scheme 4. One OAc− ligand may be release from the catalyst due to absence of Mn(V) in the medium that was confirmed by XPS analysis of the mixture, in which did not found any Mn(V) species in the mixture (Fig. 7 a) [27]. The reaction of oxo-compound (Scheme 4-b) with alcohol lead to (c) and (d) intermediates. We observed that the reaction conversion noticeably drops with aliphatic alcohols. To elucidation of this matter, in a model reaction, butanal in a same condition was oxidized and only 49% conversion was afforded for butanal. The second reason was the effect of oxidant. Carbonyl compounds can be formed by nucleophile attack of the oxygen of L3Mn(IV) (d) to hydroxyl proton of alcohol, leading to the reduction of L3Mn(IV) to L3Mn(III). In this step a water molecule was eliminated and the catalyst was released for the next catalytic cycle. Carbonyl compound can be converted to oxime or imine in the presence of hydroxyl amine hydrochloride or an imine (Scheme 4). Due to the nature of carbocation intermediate, a dry non-proton environment was considered necessary for this transformation to adsorb the by-product water [53]. However, the Cozzi et al. in a nucleophilic substitution of alcohols in water, expressed that water on the surface phase can form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of alcohols, and the alcohols were activated and converted to carbocation [54,55]. So, it can be concluded that presence of water in H2O2 37% helps to carbocation formation and provides highest efficiencies than others. Other non-proton environments also provided sufficient stability for the preparation of carbocations. In order to manifest of effect of imidazole counter ion into oxidation, we prepared a homologue of 9 that is free coordinated metal form (10, Table 8 ), then applied it for oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of an oxidant. The reaction was performed with previously premium conditions obtained in the presence of 9. The experiment clearly demonstrated synergetic effect of the counter ion for oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The results were tabulated in Table 8. The reaction did not show any progress in the presence of molecular oxygen; demonstrating the influence of Mn complex to oxidation as shown in Scheme 4. Oxidation occurs with other oxidants, but with lower efficiencies than when using catalyst 9 for oxidation; this matter proving the synergetic effect of the imidazolium counter ion that helps oxidation. As shown in the scheme of Table 8, it was suggested that an exchange ion led to the formation of imidazolium-oxidant ion. The highest and the lowest conversion was belonging to NaIO4 and KHSO5 with 62 and 42% conversion, respectively. It seems the most stable anion (better distribution of negative charge) gives the most conversion. The order of conversion was: NaIO4 > KHSO5 > NaClO4 ≥ CHP > TBHP > H2O2 (Table 8). An interesting note was their selectivity. As shown in Table 8, benzaldehyde selectivity was completely lost for all of oxidants, which clearly demonstrating the role of the coordinated Mn on benzaldehyde selectivity. In accordance with proposed mechanism depicted in Scheme 4, Mn complex controlled the oxidation process and provides high selectivity toward benzaldehyde. The proposed mechanism for the Fe3O4@SiO2@Mn(III) complex-catalyzed oxidation of alcohol by O2 is presented in Scheme 5. Selective transformation of alcohol to carboxylic acid by O2 persuaded us to investigate the reaction mechanism in the presence of molecular oxygen. In contrast to the mechanism proposed for Fe3O4@SiO2@Mn(III) complex-catalyzed oxidation of alcohol by oxidants such as H2O2, NaOCl, KHSO5, BuOOH and NaIO4, a radical mechanism was postulated according to our observations: (i) The reaction did not show any progress under N2 or Ar atmosphere, (ii) in situ XPS investigation on the reaction mixture demonstrated that Mn(II), Mn(III) and Mn(IV) species are present in the mixture (Fig. 7b). Mn(II) has a satellite feature (∼647 eV), which is not present for either Mn(III) or Mn(IV) [27], (iii) the reaction progress dropped immediately after addition of hydroquinone or naringenin, as a radical scavenger (Fig. 7c), after 5 h of the reaction (GC analysis). Also, in one another experiment, radical scavenger (hydroquinone or naringenin) was added in the beginning of the reaction. It was observed that alcohol oxidation proceeds to aldehyde/ketone and didn't see any acid product (GC analysis). Furthermore, it was proved that aldehyde plays a role of co-reductant in the epoxidation reactions [56] and a radical mechanism was acceptable in literature [57–59], which could be extended to this reaction. Theses evidences revealed that the reaction path for oxidation of alcohol to aldehyde (Scheme 5, cycle A) didn't involve any radical, and more oxidation of aldehyde to acid go through from a radical path (Scheme 5, cycle B) that is consistence with the literature [60,61]. For Mn-catalyzed aerobic oxidation of alcohols, a redox mechanism was assumed [62]. As depicted in Scheme 5, the Mn(IV) species oxidized alcohol to aldehyde. The Mn(IV) was reduced to Mn(III), which was re-oxidized to Mn(IV) by molecular oxygen (Scheme 5, cycle A). In the circle B, the initiation starts with the transformation of aldehyde to the corresponding acyl radical (RCO˙) catalyzed by the L4Mn(III) metal complex. Then, this radical reacts with O2 producing an acylperoxy radical which can generate another acyl radical by reacting with second aldehyde (propagation stage), where upon it is converted to the RCO3H (peroxyacid). A manganese-oxo species [L4MnO], as reactive oxidation species, is assumed, which is formed after reaction between the RCO3H (peroxyacid) and the metal complex. The cycle is terminating in this step with formation of carboxylic acid, the product. Finally, manganese-oxo species converted to L4Mn(III) by reacting with an aldehyde molecule and formed another carboxylic acid product (Scheme 5). This conversion could also be afforded by two equivalents of proton, where one molecule of water is formed. The cycle continues by reformation of L4Mn(III). The mechanism was completely consistence with our observations in CV, where the coordinated Mn undergo reversible oxidation in the solution, which was assigned to MnII/MnIII/MnIV redox couplings."
16,Chemoselectivity,"3.5 Chemoselectivity Chemoselectivity behavior of the Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex nanocomposite was studied by oxidation of various combinations of alcohols, in the presence of the catalyst under optimized conditions as shown in Table 9 . The catalyst was completely selective operated toward oxidation of primary than secondary alcohols (Table 9, entry 1). Also, high selectivity was shown for aromatic or conjugated alcohol in the mixture of benzyl alcohol/butyl alcohol (Table 9, entry 2) and cinnamyl alcohol/allyl alcohol (Table 9, entry 3). It was shown that there is a serious competition between oxidation of benzyl alcohol and cinnamyl alcohol (Table 9, entry 4), which spread of products can be seen in this case. This could be attributed to the facile carbocation formation for them as demonstrated in the proposed mechanism (Scheme 4). In another experiment, we performed the oxidation process in the mixture of benzyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol and 1-phenylethanol (Table 9, entry 6), in which same results as obtained with the previous combinations. It worth note that alcohol oxidation selectively occurs without interference of amine, that was valuable for one pot preparation of imine by alcohol oxidation. Complete results for the catalyst selectivity was tabulated in Table 9."
17,Catalyst reuse and stability,"3.6 Catalyst reuse and stability Reusability of a heterogeneous catalyst is one of the most important properties of metal catalysts from the green chemistry point of view, that should be investigated [63]. Reusability and stability of the magnetic catalyst in the oxidation reactions was studied. In this way, the catalyst 9 was recovered by applying an external magnetic field and reused for at least seven times without observation of noticeable loss in its catalytic activity and selectivity (Fig. 8 ). Also, amount of Mn leached into the solution for benzyl alcohol oxidation to aldehyde and/or acid after each cycle was measured by ICP. The amount of Mn loading after 1st cycle reached to 0.8% and 0.3% for oxidation to benzaldehyde and benzoic acid respectively, and after 7 consecutive recycling they were 4.3% and 3.0% (Fig. 8). Moreover, ICP analysis of the catalyst for each heavy metal demonstrated an insignificant change in their weight percentage than the corresponding fresh values: Fe 45.77, Si 2.23, Mn 6.6 w%. These results demonstrated insignificant changes in the percentages of the heavy metals and confirm the durability of the catalyst during recycling. 3.6.1 Hot filtration test In order to confirm the heterogeneous nature of the catalyst and to determine the extent of Mn leached after the reactions, we used the hot filtration test [64]. For this purpose, we studied the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III) complex nanocomposite under optimized conditions. The catalyst was magnetically removed in situ after 50% conversion (GC) and the reactants were allowed to undergo further reaction. These results indicated that after removal of the heterogeneous catalyst, the free catalyst residue was weakly active and confirms that the catalyst acts heterogeneously in the reaction and only slight leaching was take place during the reaction. 3.6.2 Three phase test Furthermore, a three-phase test was applied for more insight into heterogeneous nature of the nanocatalyst (Scheme 6 ) [64]. The test was performed by reaction of 4-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol-polymer-bound, aniline and H2O2 in the presence of Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III) complex (Scheme 6). As shown in Scheme 6, the imine product did not form in this conditions, which in the end of the reaction the catalyst was separated, and the result of hydrolysis treatment of the resin was 4-(hydroxymethyl)phenol. The obtained results strongly suggest that the catalyst is truly heterogeneous, which the one-pot preparation of imine did not occurs in the liquid phase. Finally, in order to ensure about structure of the recovered catalyst, we studied it after 7th run with some analyses and compared them with the corresponding fresh catalyst. FTIR analyses corroborated that structure of the catalyst remains completely intact (Fig. 9 a). The recovered catalyst was responded to the external magnetic field and readily collected from the reaction mixture as same as the fresh catalyst. But, a slight promotion of magnetization was seen for the recovered than the fresh catalyst (Fig. 9b). However, this behavior may be reasonable, because of leaching happening of the recovered catalyst that cause to the catalyst more affected by magnetic field than before. EDX spectrum of the recovered catalyst revealed the presence the elements that confirming the stability of the catalyst during the reactions. One interesting point was intensity reduction of Cl peak. This was completely consistence with ion exchange of imidazolium Cl− ion with oxidant causes the peak intensity decreases, proved its consumption (Fig. 9c). The XPS analysis revealed that Mn species present in the catalyst remains intact after 7th run and were in oxidation state as same as the fresh catalyst. It was also in agreement with the proposed catalytic cycles in the mechanism studies. No other species with other oxidation states were found in the catalyst (Fig. 9d). The SEM image of the recovered catalyst after 7th run shows that the nanoparticles are still approximately spherical in shape. Furthermore, the hydrodynamic diameter of the catalyst was studied by DLS technique. As shown in Fig. 9e, a narrow size distribution Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III) complex was obtained with a mean diameter of around 66 nm. Generally, the size of catalysts and leaching of metal species will be increased after each cycle and so, the increase of the catalyst size causes to decreases in the yield. The TEM image of the recovered catalyst exhibited the morphology and homogeneity of the particles (Fig. 9f). Finally, the obtained results by the present catalytic methodology were compared with some reported catalysts for direct preparation of N-benzylideneaniline from benzyl alcohol and aniline. Table 10 shows the efficiency and advantages of the present method in terms of time, yield and TOF. The catalyst produced the desired product in much lower time and amount of manganese (based on mol%). More importantly, the heterogeneous catalyst was prepared from a readily available inexpensive materials and could be easily separated from the mixture, recycled and reused for several times (Fig. 8) with minimal of metal contamination."
18,Conclusion,"We have introduced a general methodology for oxidation of alcohol to imine, oxime and carbonyl compounds by a magnetically recoverable Fe3O4@SiO2@Im[Cl]Mn(III)-complex nanocomposite as an efficient catalyst in the presence of H2O2 and/or O2 as an oxidant. A broad scope of primary and secondary alcohols was efficiently and selectively converted into the corresponding carbonyls, carboxylic acids, imines and oximes under several versatile reaction conditions. Imidazolium counter ion can participate to oxidation and provide a synergetic effect. But, in the metal-free homologue of the catalyst, the selectivity is lost. Mn transition metal controls well selectivity for the oxidation product. Mechanism studies suggest that Mn-catalyzed oxidation of alcohol in the presence of molecular O2 leads to carboxylic acid through a radical path; instead, a carbocation mechanism was plausible for H2O2 oxidant. The properties of the catalyst were studied by FTIR, CHN, XRD, FE-SEM, DLS, EDX, XPS, ICP, CV, 1H & 13C NMR, VSM, BET and DPV analyses. The catalyst has an appropriate magnetism, so that it can be readily separated from the mixture by an external magnet. The recovered catalyst was utilized for at least 7 consecutive runs with slight reactivity loss. The spectral investigations on the recovered catalyst revealed its stability during the processes. The catalyst was completely selective toward secondary alcohol, aliphatic alcohol and amine, which oxidation of aromatic alcohol could be readily accomplishing without any interference of them. Low cost, safe, heterogeneous, recoverable, no waste products, nano dimension, high surface area, thermal stability, chemoselectivity, good performance (mild reaction conditions and high TOFs), low metal leaching, spherical in shape, well redox behavior and versatile with a broad scope of substrates are some of the properties and advantages of the present catalyst, which make this methodology as a suitable, general and efficient method for oxidation purposes."
