0,Introduction,"Owing to the limited amount of fossil resources and the environmental problems associated with their usage, the need for alternative energy resource has been continuously increasing [1–4]. Biomass as a promising renewable resource has many advantages. For example, the use of biomass decreases greenhouse gas emissions relative to the combustion of fossil fuels, because the CO2 released during the energy conversion is reused for the regrowth of biomass. However, biomass-derived carbohydrates contain various functional groups, which require complicated upgrading steps for utilization as fuels and chemicals. To simplify the chemical conversion for upgrading, an efficient process involving high-performance catalysts with high selectivity should be developed to control the functionality of the final products. [5–7]. For bio-upgrading, furfural (FAL) is considered as a significant platform molecule that is primarily produced from the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and dehydration of hemicellulose [8]. Through optimization of reaction conditions as well as a proper choice of catalysts, FAL is converted into diverse small molecules depending on the reaction pathway [9–12]. Hydrogenation of FAL not only produces the hydrogenated molecules but also leads to modified products via rearrangement, ring-opening, and decarbonylation (Scheme 1 ) [13,14]. Each product derived from FAL hydrogenation has several industrial applications. Furfuryl alcohol (FA), which is produced through the selective hydrogenation of the aldehyde group of FAL, is used for resin production, as well as for the extraction agent of the aromatic compounds of lubricants [15]. Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), a fully hydrogenated product from FAL, is a green solvent owing to its biodegradability [16]. 2-methylfuran (MF), produced via the hydrodeoxygenation of FAL, serves as a potential fuel additive [17]. Furan (FN) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) produced during the decarbonylation step in FAL hydrogenation, are used as a fuel additive and solvent for dissolving biomass molecules, respectively [18]. Cyclopentanone (CPO), produced by the rearrangement of FAL, is extensively used as an ingredient of perfume, pesticides, and medicines [19,20]. Numerous investigations have been performed for the selective hydrogenation of FAL over supported metal catalysts including Ni [21,22], Ru [23], Cu [24,25], and Pd [26]. Based on the previous studies, Ni favors decarbonylation and ring-opening in FAL hydrogenation [27]. On the other hand, a Cu catalyst exhibits good selectivity towards FA due to the preference for the binding of C = O onto its surface [28]. Pd as a traditional hydrogenation catalyst dissociates hydrogen even under ambient conditions [29–31]. To improve the activity and selectivity, a proper choice of the support is important, because the interactions between the active metal and support dramatically change the catalytic performance [32–34]. In a previous study, we found that the Pd-supported carbon (Pd/C) catalyst has a higher activity in FAL hydrogenation than the other catalysts (Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2), because the carbon support induced a higher dispersion of Pd than alumina or silica [35]. For example, when 5 wt% Pd was loaded on carbon, the Pd dispersion measured by CO adsorption was 51.2%, exhibiting 100% FAL conversion, while the Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2 catalysts showed Pd dispersions of 31.7% and 6.6%, with FAL conversions of 92% and 31%, respectively. Because of its extraordinary physical, chemical, and mechanical properties along with high thermal and electrical conductivities, carbon has been widely used as an excellent support in many catalytic applications [36–39]. Furthermore, recent emergence of ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) further provides a new opportunity for generating porous carbons with high surface areas and tailored physicochemical properties [40–42]. As such, plenty of OMCs including CMK (Carbon Mesostructured by KAIST) carbon series [43] have been synthesized with high surface areas, large pore volumes, and tunable pore sizes and pore structures via the nanocasting method [44,45]. By filling the pores of the mesoporous silica template with a carbon source to be cast, a negative replica of the carbon, preserving the highly ordered structures, is successfully obtained after carbonization and subsequent silica etching [46]. The mesoporous silica templates used for the nanocasting are SBA-15 (Santa Barbara Amorphous-15), KIT-6 (Korea Institute of Technology-6), and so on. The OMCs can serve as model systems to study the rate of mass transfer of the reactants and the corresponding reaction phenomena as a function of the pore size and pore structure. In particular, the mass-transport phenomena are important factors in a liquid-phase reaction, whereas a gas-phase reaction is mostly affected by the adsorption behavior of the gaseous reactants on the solid metal [47]. The fast adsorption/desorption of the reactants/products, as well as the diffusion of intermediates, should be considered together with the effect of solvents in liquid-phase reactions [48]. In this work, we prepare Pd/C catalysts with various carbons to investigate the supporting effects of carbon in Pd-catalyzed FAL hydrogenation. Various OMCs with different pore sizes and structures, including CMK-3, CMK-5, CMK-8, and MSU-F-C (MSU; Michigan State University), are used as the carbon supports. Multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNTs) and a commercial carbon (Vulcan XC) are also used for comparison. For the preparation of Pd/C catalysts with high dispersions, chemical reduction by sodium borohydride is conducted in the presence of trisodium citrate, which helps to anchor small Pd clusters on carbons. The Pd dispersion in the Pd/C catalysts is determined by CO adsorption. Liquid-phase FAL hydrogenation is carried out over various Pd/C catalysts in two different solvents (2-propanol and water). Pd/CMK-5 exhibits the highest conversion of FAL in both 2-propanol and water solvents among Pd/C catalysts, which is attributed to the largest surface area and hexagonal hollow tubular framework of CMK-5 support. For catalytic selectivity of FAL hydrogenation, the choice of solvent exerts a significant impact, while the type of carbon support has a negligible influence."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of mesoporous carbons,"2.1 Synthesis of mesoporous carbons OMCs are synthesized via the nanocasting method using mesoporous silica templates (SBA-15, KIT-6, and MSU-F) [49–51]. The distinct pore structures of the mesoporous silicas determine the final mesostructure of the OMCs. In the current study, CMK-3, CMK-5, CMK-8, and MSU-F-C were prepared by using different mesoporous silica templates (SBA-15, KIT-6, and MSU-F), as well as different carbon sources. When mesoporous silicas SBA-15 with p6mm symmetry and KIT-6 with Ia3d symmetry were used as the templates, the mesoporous carbons CMK-3 and CMK-8 were produced, respectively. In this process, 4 g of mesoporous silica (SBA-15 or KIT-6) was completely mixed with 5.5 g of sucrose (C12H22O11) in 20 g of distilled water containing 0.62 g of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The mixture was cured in an oven at 100 ℃ for 6 h and at 160 ℃ for another 2 h. The above procedure was repeated with 3.3 g of sucrose for the complete infiltration of the carbons. The dried powder was carbonized under 1.0 l/min N2 (or Ar) flow at 400 ℃ for 4 h and at 900 ℃ for another 2 h in the oven. To remove the silica template from the carbon-silica composite, 10% hydrogen fluoride (HF, J. T. Baker, 48–51 %) and ethanol (1:1) were mixed with the composite for 30 min. The composite mixture was filtrated with ethanol several times and the etching procedure was repeated. After washing and drying samples, CMK-3 and CMK-8 were obtained with the p6mm and Ia3d space groups, respectively. A mesocellular carbon foam, MSU-F-C, was prepared by a similar method as that described above. 4 g of the mesoporous silica MSU-F was dispersed in 20 g of distilled water containing 0.62 g of sulfuric acid. Then, 5.5 g of sucrose was added to the mixture to fill the pores of MSU-F, and the solution was placed in an oven at 100 ℃ for 6 h and at 160 ℃ for 2 h. The washed and dried powder after filtration was further heated for 4 h at 400 ℃ and 2 h at 900 ℃ to carbonize the sucrose inside the template. For the preparation of CMK-5, aluminum-substituted mesoporous SBA-15 (Al-SBA-15) was used as the template. In this process, 3.0 g of SBA-15 were treated with 0.33 g of AlCl3 (Sigma Aldrich, 98%) in 59.20 g of ethanol. The resulting Al-SBA-15 was obtained after removing the solvent in a rotary evaporator at 60 ℃ and subsequent calcination at 550 ℃ for 5 h. The as-prepared Al-SBA-15 (3.05 g) was mixed with 2.75 g of FA (C5H6O2, Sigma Aldrich, 98%) as a carbon source and dried at 90 ℃ for 24 h. After carbonization at 350 ℃ for 3 h and at 900 ℃ for 6 h, and subsequent silica etching with 10% HF in ethanol (1:1), CMK-5 with hexagonally ordered tubular structures was obtained."
3,Preparation of Pd/C catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of Pd/C catalysts Pd/C catalysts with various carbon supports were prepared through the chemical reduction method by using sodium borohydride as a reducing agent (Scheme 2 ) [52]. H2PdCl4 (0.1 M PdCl2, Sigma Aldrich 99% in 0.1 M HCl) with the calculated amount of Pd depending on the loading, was dissolved in 100 ml of a trisodium citrate (2.5 mM, Na3C6H5O7, Sigma Aldrich, 98+ %) solution under vigorous stirring (˜500 rpm). After slowing the stirring rate (350 rpm), 1 g of the carbon support was added to the Pd precursor solution, in which the carbon-metal precursor mixture became a black slurry. After stirring for 2 h, 75 ml of a freshly prepared ice-cold sodium borohydride (0.06 M, NaBH4, Sigma Aldrich 98%) solution was added dropwise to the slurry and stirred for 5 h at room temperature. The solution was filtered and washed with deionized water, and dried at 105 ℃ overnight in an oven. Through these procedures, Pd supported on mesoporous carbons, Pd/CMK-3, Pd/CMK-5, Pd/CMK-8, and Pd/MSU-F-C were prepared. For comparisons, CNTs (MR99, Carbon Nano-material Technology Co.) and commercial carbon (Vulcan, Cabot Co.) were used for the Pd/C catalysts (Pd/CNT and Pd/Vulcan). The prepared Pd/C catalysts were reduced under a flow of H2 (4% H2 in Ar) at 250 ℃ for 2 h."
4,Catalytic FAL hydrogenation over Pd/C catalysts,"2.3 Catalytic FAL hydrogenation over Pd/C catalysts Catalytic hydrogenation of FAL was conducted in a 100 ml stainless steel autoclave reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer (Parr reactor). In a typical procedure, 0.01 g of the Pd/C catalyst was added to the reactor containing 1.0 g of FAL (C5H4O2, Sigma Aldrich, 99%) and 20 ml of 2-propanol ((CH3)2CHOH, Alfa Aesar, anhydrous, 99.5+%). The closed reactor was then purged with H2 gas to remove the dissolved air, and pressurized to 2 MPa. The reaction temperature was increased to 180 ℃ and maintained there for 5 h under stirring at 600 rpm. After the completion of the reaction, the resulting solutions were filtrated with a syringe filter with an average channel size of 0.2 μm. Aqueous FAL hydrogenation was performed using the same procedure in water, instead of 2-propanol. In this reaction, 0.02 g of the catalyst was used with 1.0 g of FAL in 20 ml of deionized water in a 100 ml batch reactor. After flushing three times with pure hydrogen, the sample was heated to 160 ℃ under 3 MPa of H2 gas pressure and 600 rpm stirring for 5 h. For analysis of the products in water, 2-propanol was added as the external standard. The products were identified and quantified using a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7820A) equipped with an Agilent DB-WAX column and a flame ionization detector (FID). The conversion, selectivity, and yield were calculated using the equations shown below. The carbon balance was generally greater than 94% in all FAL reactions. Conversion % = C FAL,initial − C FAL,final C FAL,initial × 100 % ; Selectivity % = C specific product C total product × 100 % ; and Yield % = Conversion × Selectivity × 1 100 ."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of the Pd/C catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption in a BEL SORP-max unit, and the physical values were converted by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The size distribution of the mesopores was calculated using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method from the adsorption isotherms. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the Pd/C catalysts were obtained using JEOL JEM-1400 and JEOL JEM-2100 F, respectively. The morphology and Pd metal dispersion of the Pd/C catalysts were confirmed by TEM and HRTEM, along with the dark-field image of scanning TEM (STEM), high-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF), and EDS mapping. The content of Pd in the catalyst was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Varian 700-ES). Before the ICP-AES measurement, the concentration of Pd was calibrated using a standard Pd solution (Sigma Aldrich, TraceCERT®), and the catalyst dissolved in aqua regia was measured after dilution in water. The Pd dispersion was evaluated on the basis of the CO adsorption capacity using a pulse technique involving CO chemisorption (AutoChem II 2920; Micromeritics Instruments Co.). Through ICP-AES and CO chemisorption, the metallic surfaces of the Pd catalysts were confirmed. X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a K-alpha (ThermoFisher) equipped with an Al Kα X-ray radiation source. All the catalysts were reduced by hydrogen (4% H2 in Ar) immediately before the measurements. The binding energy of adventitious carbon contamination, C (1s), was used as the reference for the binding energies of Pd (3d). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a PANalytical X’Pert PRO using a Cu Kα X-ray radiation source operating at 40 kV and 40 mA."
6,Result and discussion,
7,Characterization of OMCs and Pd/C catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of OMCs and Pd/C catalysts OMCs are synthesized through the nanocasting method using various mesoporous silicas as the hard templates (Scheme 2). After filling a carbon source into the mesoporous silica template in solution, the infiltrated carbon precursor is carbonized, resulting in the OMC replica after silica etching by a HF solution. When the mesoporous silicas SBA-15, KIT-6, and MSU-F are used as templates, with sucrose as the carbon source, CMK-3, CMK-8, and MSU-F-C are produced, respectively. When Al-SBA-15 is filled by FA instead of sucrose as the carbon source, CMK-5 with hexagonally ordered tubular structures is obtained. The morphologies, pore structures, and space groups of the OMCs are summarized in Scheme 3 . Pd/C catalysts are prepared through the chemical reduction of aqueous H2PdCl4 by sodium borohydride in the presence of OMCs. The physicochemical properties of the OMCs and corresponding Pd/C catalysts are determined by XRD, N2 physisorption, TEM, HR-TEM, CO chemisorption, and XPS analyses. Low-angle XRD patterns reveal the structural order of the mesoporous carbons CMK-3, CMK-5, and CMK-8 (Fig. 1 ). CMK-3 and CMK-5 show three distinct peaks, indexed as (100), (110), and (200) in the XRD patterns (Fig. 1a), demonstrating that CMK-3 and CMK-5 are replica of the SBA-15 template with hexagonal structure of p6mm space group. The (100) XRD peak of CMK-5 has lower intensity than those of SBA-15 and CMK-3 because of the interference of the diffraction originating from the hollow structure of CMK-5. CMK-8, a replica of KIT-6, has a three-dimensional interconnected cubic structure with Ia3d space group, which is confirmed by XRD (Fig. 1b). However, MSU-F-C exhibits a featureless low-angle XRD pattern due to its poorly ordered mesostructure, which is in good agreement with the mesocellular carbon foam structure of the MCF-17 template (Fig. 1c). The structural properties of the OMCs after Pd loading are investigated by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and TEM. For comparison, multiwalled CNTs and Vulcan XC, are also used as carbon supports for the Pd/C catalysts. In N2 sorption analyses (Supplementary Material Fig. S1), the Pd-supported OMCs show the type-IV isotherms with pronounced capillary condensation steps, indicating that the mesopore structure of the OMCs is preserved after Pd loading. The surface areas determined by the BET method indicate that the Pd-supported OMCs (>1000 m2‧g−1) have higher surface areas than those of the commercial CNT and Vulcan catalysts (<260 m2‧g−1). As listed in Table 1 , CMK-5 has the highest surface area (1424 m2‧g−1) owing to its distinct hollow two-dimensional hexagonal structure. Pd/OMC catalysts show sharp and narrow pore size distributions because of their unique pore structures (Fig. S2). The peak pore widths of Pd/CMK-3, Pd/CMK-5, and Pd/CMK-8 measured by the BJH distribution curve are 5.5, 4.9, and 3.8 nm, respectively. TEM images further confirm the textural properties of the Pd/C catalysts (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2a–c show that CMK-3, CMK-5, and CMK-8 have highly ordered mesoporous structures with two-dimensional hexagonal channels, hollow hexagonal tubes, and three-dimensional cubic structures, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2d, MSU-F-C has a foam-like amorphous mesoporous structure. Fig. 2e and f show CNTs with a representative tubular shape and oval-shaped Vulcan carbons, as illustrated in Scheme 3. Pd/CNT and Pd/MSU-F-C show broad pore distribution curves, indicating that CNT and MSU-F-C carbons have random pore distributions (Fig. S2). The amount of Pd metal content in the Pd/C catalysts is measured by ICP-AES. The resulting value is ca. 1 wt% Pd on carbon in all the Pd/C catalysts (Table 1). To determine the Pd dispersion in Pd/C catalysts, CO chemisorption is used. The Pd surface area was calculated by combining Pd contents determined by ICP-AES and CO chemisorption results. As indicated in Table 1, the calculated Pd dispersion of Pd/C catalysts is 32–42 %, in which OMC supported catalysts show similar dispersion. Hence, the chemical reduction method provides an efficient way for the preparation of Pd/C catalysts with high dispersion of Pd, regardless of the effect of carbon surface area. In the chemical reduction step, trisodium citrate plays a critical role in anchoring small Pd clusters on carbons [53]. The specific interactions between H2PdCl4 and trisodium citrate facilitate the high dispersion of Pd on the carbons. As shown in TEM images (Fig. 2), the Pd nanoparticles formed on the carbons are too small to be identified. The size of Pd nanoparticles was also accessed by XRD patterns. As shown in Fig. S3, none of the Pd/C catalysts reveals distinct Pd peaks, demonstrating that Pd nanoparticles are homogeneously deposited on the carbons and that the size of Pd is very extremely small. The HR-TEM and STEM-HAADF images of the Pd-supported OMC catalysts (Pd/OMCs) prepared by using CMK-3, CMK-5, and CMK-8 also confirm that small Pd nanoparticles (<2 nm) are homogeneously deposited over the OMCs (Fig. 3 ), regardless of their morphologies. The chemical states of the Pd nanoparticles in the Pd/C catalysts are investigated by XPS. As shown in the Pd 3d spectra (Fig. 4 ), the Pd species has two chemical states: Pd0 and Pd2+. The peaks at 335.6 eV and 340.8 eV are assigned to the metallic Pd0 state, while the higher peaks at 337.6 eV and 342.4 eV belong to Pd2+. The presence of PdO species in the catalyst is attributed to the small size of Pd nanoparticles (˜ 5 nm), which are easily oxidized due to the high surface to volume ratio [54–56]. Based on the XPS result, all the Pd/C catalysts have a Pd0/Pd2+ ratio higher than 1.0, indicating that the Pd nanoparticles have a predominantly metallic (Pd0) state."
8,FAL hydrogenation over Pd/C catalysts,"3.2 FAL hydrogenation over Pd/C catalysts Liquid-phase hydrogenation of FAL is carried out over Pd/C catalysts to investigate the effect of the morphology of carbons. Because the Pd/C catalysts are prepared with high Pd dispersion regardless of the effect of carbon surface area, they are useful to investigate the support effect of carbons with different morphologies. For FAL hydrogenation, 0.01 g of Pd/C catalysts is used with 1.0 g of FAL in 20 ml of 2-propanol, and the reaction proceeds under 2 MPa H2 at 180 ℃ for 5 h. Under these conditions, FAL is converted via three major reaction pathways to produce FN by decarbonylation, CPO via rearrangement, and FA via aldehyde hydrogenation. FN, CPO, and FA are further hydrogenated to THF, cyclopentanol (CPL), and THFA, respectively. MF is also produced as a final product by the hydration of FAL (Scheme 1). The FAL conversion and product selectivity are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 5 . The major products in FAL hydrogenation are FA and THFA. It was reported that an alcohol solvent led to the reduction of the CO group and/or the furan ring in FAL hydrogenation [19]. While most of the reaction results show product selectivity similar to the previous results [19], the overall FAL conversion reveals obvious differences among the Pd/C catalysts. When OMCs are used as the support, Pd-catalyzed FAL hydrogenation exhibits higher conversions (<60%) than those involving the Pd/CNT and Pd/Vulcan catalysts (<50%). In particular, Pd/CMK-5 shows the highest conversion, up to 100%, while considerable differences in product selectivity among the catalysts are not observed. The major products involving the Pd/CMK-5 catalyst are FA, THFA, MF, and CPL, with selectivities of 20.3, 31.5, 13.4, and 16.3%, respectively. FAL conversion over Pd/C catalysts increases in the order: Pd/CMK-5 > Pd/CMK-3 > Pd/CMK-8 > Pd/MSU-F-C > Pd/Vulcan > Pd/CNT. The major reason of high activity of Pd/CMK-5 is high dispersion and corresponding the highly exposed Pd surface area (See Table 1). In our previous study on FAL hydrogenation over Pd/C catalysts, the conversion further increased with increasing reaction time and temperature [35]. With the same reaction condition, the conversion was mainly determined by the degree of the Pd dispersion. In the current study, homogeneously distributed Pd nanoparticles on various carbons have the same structure of fcc Pd with a (111) facet (Fig. S4). HR-TEM and XPS reveal that the crystal structure and chemical states of the Pd nanoparticles are not significantly different between Pd/C catalysts. The morphological effect of the carbons can only be considered in terms of the configuration of the carbon frameworks and the structure of the mesopores, because the Pd has no structural and chemical difference. Comparing to the commercial carbons (CNTs and Vulcan), Pd/OMCs (CMK-3, CMK-5, and CMK-8) have high FAL conversions, which are ascribed to the well-ordered pore structures, having either p6mm or Ia3d space group and high surface areas. Although MSU-F-C has a high surface area (1163 m2‧g−1) and high Pd dispersion (40.9%), its carbon mesocellular foam-like structure results in less FAL conversion compared to those of Pd/OMCs. The ordered carbon framework is responsible for the activity of the Pd/C catalysts in FAL hydrogenation, based on the fact that faster mass transport and absorption/diffusion processes are possible with the ordered mesoporous structure having a narrow pore distribution [57,58]. Before the comparison of the Pd/OMCs, it is significant to estimate the limitation of mass transport in the OMCs during the reaction [57]. When the stirring speed is increased, there is no significant change in the FAL hydrogenation reaction over Pd/OMCs, indicating that no limitation on interphase transfer exists during the reaction [59]. In the previous report [59], the computed intraparticle transfer number (i.e., Weisz-Prater number) was much less than 0.3, indicating the absence of intraparticle diffusion limitations. Therefore, in the current study, only internal transport limitations should be considered as a structural factor that affect the different FAL conversions over Pd/OMCs. The lowest conversion of Pd/CMK-8 among the three Pd/OMCs (Fig. 5) is attributed to the three-dimensional cubic mesoporous structure (Ia3d). While the two-dimensional hexagonally ordered mesoporous channels (p6mm) of the Pd/CMK-5 and Pd/CMK-3 catalysts induce high mass transports owing to their straightforward internal channels, the interconnected cubic pores (Ia3d) of Pd/CMK-8 permit less internal diffusion compared to those of p6mm. Eventually, Pd/CMK-5 consisted of hexagonal hollow tubular frameworks results in the highest FAL conversion (Table 2 and Fig. 5)."
9,Selective FAL hydrogenation towards CPO,"3.3 Selective FAL hydrogenation towards CPO CPO is produced through FAL hydrogenation when water is used as a solvent; water molecules facilitate the rearrangement of FAL [60]. Based on the knowledge of activity enhancement as a function of the morphology of carbons, both Pd/CMK-3 and Pd/CMK-5 catalysts are selected for the selective FAL hydrogenation towards CPO in water under modified reaction conditions. In accordance with the previous trends of FAL hydrogenation in 2-propanol, Pd/CMK-5 (86.4%) shows a higher FAL conversion than Pd/CMK-3 (80.8%) in water (Table 3 and Fig. 6 a). However, the product distribution of aqueous FAL hydrogenation is significantly different from the corresponding result for 2-propanol. In Fig. 6b, CPO is a major product for both the catalysts, at the expense of FA. According to the reported mechanism [61], the produced FA by FAL hydrogenation rearranged to produce 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone (4−HCP). The 4−HCP intermediate was further hydrogenated into cyclopentenone (CPEO), and CPO is finally produced from hydrogenation of CPEO (Fig. 6b). From these results, it is found that the product selectivity in FAL hydrogenation over various Pd/C catalysts is affected strongly by the type of solvent, and not by the choice of carbon. In the previous study, when Pd was replaced by Co and Cu, or when the oxide support was changed instead of carbon, the product selectivity was significantly changed in FAL hydrogenation, because the specific interface changed the reaction pathway [62]. Of the various supports including alumina, silica, and other transition metal oxides, carbon induced the highest dispersion of Pd. From these results, it is concluded that the main role of carbon is to generate high dispersion of Pd catalyst due to its large surface area. The product selectivity is determined by number of factors, including the type of metal and support, the solvent used, and the degree of reaction conditions"
10,Conclusion,"Various OMCs, including CMK-3, CMK-5, CMK-8, and MSU-F-C, are used as carbon supports for Pd/C catalysts. The catalytic properties are compared by using the different carbon supports in Pd-catalyzed FAL hydrogenation. While FAL conversion is greatly enhanced by using OMCs with Pd, the Pd/CMK-5 catalyst exhibited the highest conversion. The two-dimensional hexagonally ordered mesoporous channels (p6mm) of CMK-5 enable fast adsorption/diffusion during the reaction during Pd-catalyzed FAL hydrogenation. The product selectivity in FAL hydrogenation over various Pd/C catalysts is affected predominantly by the type of solvent, and not by the carbon supports. For example, the Pd/C catalysts show similar product distributions in 2-propanol, however a high selectivity towards CPO is observed when water is used as the solvent. We expect that the clever choice of a carbon support composed of OMCs will contribute to the development of high-performance catalysts, as well as help to understand the underlying catalytic phenomena."
