0,Introduction,"For the selective hydrogenation of carbonyl function of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes into unsaturated alcohols the main industrial processes are still relying on the technique which uses the reduction of the unsaturated aldehydes considering the classical reactions with reducing agents such as aluminium lithium hydride (AlLiH4), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), or aluminium alcoholates (Al(OCH(CH3)2)3. However, there is a growing interest in the development of an heterogeneous catalytic process [1,2] because these classical processes generate lot of side products which are harmful. As an example, when producing 1kg of a fine product, between 50 and 100kg of side products are eliminated [3]. Due to thermodynamics, hydrogenation on conventional catalysts gives the saturated aldehyde as the main reaction product (Scheme 1 ). Platinum is the metal which has been considered the most in making and testing catalysts in hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. It was quickly noticed that the yield in unsaturated alcohol is not only a specificity of the catalyst alone but depends on the structure of the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde considered as well [4] and properly designed catalysts for this purpose should strongly polarise the carbonyl group in an adsorbed α,β-unsaturated aldehyde molecule, enhancing its reactivity to hydrogen and diminishing carbon–carbon bond activity [5–7]. It is worth mentioning that, as far as Pt is concerned, novel catalysts having high selectivity to unsaturated alcohol (higher than 80%) in crotonaldehyde gas phase hydrogenation were obtained [8–10]. Excellent results were also obtained with Pt based catalysts in the liquid phase hydrogenation with higher carbon number α,β-unsaturated aldehydes such as cinnamaldehyde [11,12]. Reports on cobalt catalysts in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes are limited but they have demonstrated its promising potential in this field. Initially cobalt made its entry as modifier in catalysts and in the Raney form [13,14]. The combination cobalt-boride has received special attention in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation and considerable amount of unsaturated alcohol was produced on these catalysts [15,16]. In more recent works, the catalyst structure sensitivity of the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has been studied by using uniformly dispersed cobalt on silica prepared by the reduction of cobalt–chrysotile and satisfactory high selectivities to unsaturated alcohols were obtained with catalysts, prepared from chloride precursor, having relatively large size cobalt crystallites [17,18]. Later Ando et al. [19] were able to reproduce these high selectivity performances using an alumina-supported cobalt catalyst. Differently, Rodrigues and Bueno [20] or Bailie et al. [21] found lower crotyl alcohol selectivity (20, 37%, respectively) in gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde on Co/SiO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation from nitrate cobalt salt. On a cobalt catalyst prepared from cobalt acetyl acetonate, Coq et al. [22] found a relatively high allyl alcohol selectivity (60%) in acrolein hydrogenation at the initial time of the reaction; however, this high value decreased rapidly with the time on stream. The search for higher unsaturated alcohol selectivity led LaNeve et al. [23] to design special structure cobalt catalyst based on titanium–cobalt clusters which, upon thermal activation, yields a catalyst very successful for the formation of the crotyl alcohol. Since most active noble metals are expensive (i.e., Pt, Au, Pd, etc.) and to partially circumvent this, non-precious metals such as Fe, Co, Ni, etc. are well suited for catalytic studies. It is noteworthy that catalysis on cobalt is 445 times cheaper than on platinum. The present paper reports on the performance of a highly loaded Co/SiO2 catalyst prepared by the precipitation method and used in the gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Nitta et al. [18] observed that the higher cobalt loading giving large particle sizes resulted in higher selectivity to unsaturated alcohol. Differently as they proposed, this suggests that the structure sensitivity in this reaction cannot be explained only in term of crystallites dimensions. Studies involving the influence of the cobalt catalyst surface structure in this reaction are scare. It is well established [18] that the performance of cobalt catalysts in this type of reaction depends very much on the interaction existing between the metal and the support, which at its turn depends on the preparation conditions as well as the precursor salt but information on the effect of different thermal treatments at which the precursor has been submitted is lacking. So, this part will receive a great deal of attention in this work. Detailed microstructure investigations of the catalysts as a function of the different treatments will follow using temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and X-rays photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The characteristics of the catalysts will be exploited to correlate between the selectivity, activity and the surface structure of the catalyst in order to clarify the origin of the observed high selectivity to crotyl alcohol."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation For this study the catalyst precursor was prepared by the precipitation method from aqueous cobalt chloride solution using sodium carbonate as the precipitating agent where the support material was suspended. The detailed operations were similar to those described in [18]. The typical procedure used in our case can be summarised as follows: 5g of silica, Cabosil type, M5 grade having a specific area of 200m2/g were washed twice with 100ml portions of distilled water before they were mixed with 20.17g of CoCl2·6H2O (0.085mol) which is the predetermined weight of the salt to give a catalyst with a molar ratio composition Co/SiO2 of 50/50 in 125ml of distilled water. The mixture was kept under magnetic stirring for 15min at room temperature then heated to the precipitation temperature (90°C). A volume of 85ml of a molar Na2CO3 (0.085mol) aqueous solution, preheated to the precipitation temperature was added to the mixture under vigorous stirring. The pink coloured precipitate was kept under stirring for 30min at the same temperature. There after, it was filtered and washed three times with 125ml portions of warm distilled water. The washed sample was dried at 120°C for 48h after which the material was grinded into a fine powder. The precursor was calcined at two temperatures 400 and 550°C for 4h in a 100ml/min dry synthetic air flow in a tubular oven heated up at a 10°C/min."
3,Crotonaldehyde hydrogenation,"2.2 Crotonaldehyde hydrogenation Catalytic tests were performed in a glass fixed-bed reactor, operating at atmospheric pressure under a continuous flow as described elsewhere [9]. Crotonaldehyde at constant partial pressure (8Torr) was carried by purified hydrogen flow (40–50ml/min). Before each experiment, the catalyst (10–50mg) was reduced for 2h at the chosen reduction temperature then cooled down to the desired reaction temperature. The reactor effluents were analysed by an on-line gas-liquid chromatograph (GPC) with a 30m long, 0.5461×10−3 m diameter DB-Wax column (J&W Scientific), at 85°C using a flame ionisation detector and helium as the carrier gas. The retention times of the different products were: hydrocarbons (101s), butanal (115s), crotonaldehyde (140s), butanol (166s), trans and cis crotyl alcohol (204 and 221s, respectively). Peak surfaces corresponding to the different products were measured on a computer running on a home made program. The reaction activities were calculated using the formula A =(αF/ω), α being the crotonaldehyde conversion, F the crotonaldehyde flow in μmol/s, and ω is the weight of cobalt in g. The selectivity to the different products formed was calculated as the molar ratio of the selected product to the total products formed. The sensitivity factors were taken according to the Dietz tables [24]. For comparison of activities and selectivities of different catalysts, flow rate and catalyst amount were adjusted in order to obtain similar conversion value, of about 10%."
4,Characterisation,"2.3 Characterisation The elemental analysis was done at the centre of analysis CNRS Vernaison, France. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was used to evaluate the amount of cobalt in the catalyst calcined in synthetic air at 400°C for 4h. BET (Brunauer, Emmet, Taylor) surface area measurement was carried on the same precursor using a Beckmann Coulter SA 3100 apparatus. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out in a Siemens D 5000 polycrystalline diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The spectra were recorded in a rapid scanning mode (2.0s/step, step size 0.05° in 2θ) in a large 2θ range (10–90°). Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed on a Topcon 002B electron microscope, operating at 200kV with a point to point resolution of 0.18nm in HRTEM. Some catalyst grains, taken after catalytic reduction performed at 350°C in hydrogenation apparatus, were ground and dispersed in ethanol. One drop of the suspension previously agitated in an ultrasonic shaker was deposited onto a Cu grid coated by a holey carbon film and dried in air. Various regions of the grid were observed. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed in a gas flow system using an X-Sorb-(S) instrument (GIRA Society). Twenty milligrams of sample were analysed using 1.5% H2/Ar gas mixture and 8°C/min as slope temperature. The calibration measurement of the apparatus was repeated at the end of each experimental run. The number of moles of hydrogen uptake by 1g of catalyst was deduced from the peak area. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were made on a VG ESCA III spectrometer working with magnesium anode Mg Kα=1253.6eV (11kV, 20mA) and 20eV pass energy. The sample in the form of pressed disc (8mm in diameter, 1mm thickness) was placed on a nickel support. The treatments were carried out in situ in the preparation chamber attached directly to the analysis chamber and connected to the vacuum system of the spectrometer allowing the sample to be transferred in the measurement space without exposure to air. Analysis was performed on the non-calcined, 400 and 550°C calcined precursors. Their reduction was carried in pure hydrogen at two different temperatures 350 and 500°C for 2h simulating the conditions used in the catalytic test. The Si 2p BE, at 103.3eV, was used as a reference to correct the charge effects on the samples containing silica and O 1s BE at 530eV for unsupported Co3O4 [25]. The Co 2p and the Si 2s peaks were used for quantitative analysis taking into account the difference in escape depths (a square root approximation) and in cross section (using Scofield data) [26]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,"AAS, BET surface area, DRX and TEM results","3.1 AAS, BET surface area, DRX and TEM results The elemental analysis determination and surface area measurement were carried on the catalyst calcined at 400°C for 4h under air stream. As expected a small loss in surface area was observed when the support was loaded with the metal: 200m2/g for the support and 137m2/g for the calcined material. Such behaviour was observed by other researchers [27], i.e., when the metal loading is high, the surface area decreases. The metal loading, 35.71wt.%, was observed on the calcined form which gave a catalyst composition of Co/SiO2, 41/59 weight and molar ratios (M Co =58.9g, M Si O 2 = 60.1 g ) which was slightly different from the value predicted from the catalyst preparation (50/50). This means that, in the conditions of the preparation of the precursor, not all the CoII ions were precipitated and they have been solvated as free ions in the aqueous suspension and lost during the washing. From the X-ray diffraction patterns (not reported here), the non-calcined precursor was an amorphous material while the 400 and 550°C calcined precursors showed patterns corresponding to a crystalline Co3O4 phase. Typical TEM figures of a catalyst, calcined at 400°C and reduced at 350°C, are presented in Fig. 1 showing large cobalt particles, in 50–150nm range. Some of them were well faceted with hexagonal shape. It is argued that even if the particles seem to be well shaped when seen on TEM, stacking defects clearly appeared on them which is probably associated with the imperfection of the network because of the co-existence of Co and its oxide. Electron diffraction analysis carried out on this sample (results not presented) showed simultaneously two lattice patterns indicating the existence of two different species."
7,Crotonaldehyde hydrogenation,"3.2 Crotonaldehyde hydrogenation It was first checked that no hydrogenation activity occurred on the support alone (SiO2), after its treatment in hydrogen at 350°C for 2h, for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation performed at 80°C. On the other hand, the calcined precursor (400°C, 4h) has been subjected to the hydrogenation test without undertaking any reduction. This later did not show any activity until temperatures of reaction as high as 180°C, where the formation of a very low quantity of by-products was remarked, but not identified. 3.2.1 Effect of the conditions of calcination on the activity and selectivity When the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was performed at 80°C, on the non-calcined, calcined 400°C and the calcined 550°C catalysts after reduction in situ at 350°C for 2h, the overall activity was found to decrease during the time on stream to reach quasi-steady state (Fig. 2 ). For the non-calcined and the 400°C calcined catalysts which showed similar behaviour, the activity was found to drop rapidly indicating a fast deactivation and level away in a quasi-steady state to half of the value seen at the start of the catalytic run. On the other hand, the catalyst which was calcined at 550°C showed a different behaviour. It has a much higher activity all along the catalytic run. When compared to the two other catalysts, the most important and remarkable result was the high selectivity in crotyl alcohol on the non-calcined and the 400°C calcined catalysts (Fig. 3 a and b). Selectivity in 86–90% range was observed. It is worth mentioning at this stage that selectivities of the two other products which were butanal and hydrocarbons were very low for both catalysts. On the contrary, on the catalyst calcined at 550°C, the selectivity of crotyl alcohol (Fig. 3c) which is much lower than those observed before is comparable to that of butanal. So the performance of the Co/SiO2 catalyst depended strongly on the temperature of calcination of the precursor and if this later has been calcined. The activity and the selectivity can be controlled to a certain extent by monitoring the temperature of calcination of the precursor. 3.2.2 Effect of reduction temperature on the activity and the selectivity Taking into account the result obtained when changing the conditions of calcination, the effect of the reduction temperature on the performance of this catalyst was studied on the precursor calcined at 400°C. The catalyst was reduced in situ at different temperatures ranging from 275 to 500°C. In fact, the choice of this range of temperature was made on the basis of the reduction processes observed in TPR (see later). The performance of the catalyst was found to depend significantly on the temperature of reduction. The steady state activities, taken after 1h on stream, are reported as a function of the reduction temperature in Fig. 4 (at each reduction temperature, the spatial velocity, F/ω, was adjusted to get 10% conversion in the steady state). Smaller activity was seen when the catalyst was reduced at 275°C, below which it was thought that there was no activity. As the temperature of reduction was risen, the activity increased until it reached a maximum at 350°C after which an increase in temperature was seen to lower the activity of the catalyst and reduction temperatures as high as 500°C did not improve the activity. This change in activity as a function of the reduction temperature was interpreted as follows: from 275 to 350°C, the degree of reduction of cobalt species, which was initially Co3O4 formed, was thought to increase because the higher the reduction temperature, the easier was the reduction of the precursor, leading to more metallic cobalt. Beyond 350°C reduction temperature, the activity decreased as a result of changes in the density of active sites brought about by sintering of the metallic particles on the support leading to a less exposed metallic surface for the reaction to occur. At the same time, the selectivities of the different products (at 10% conversion) were found to depend on the reduction temperature as well (Fig. 5 ). At 275°C reduction temperature, the selectivity of the crotyl alcohol was just over 60% and the second major product was butanal with 31% selectivity. The selectivity of crotyl alcohol increased with the reduction temperature to reach a maximum value of 88% in 300–350°C range, where at the same time selectivity to butanal was seen to fall to its minimum. Further increase in reduction temperature had a controversial effect on the selectivities. A rapid drop in crotyl alcohol was observed when passing from 350 to 500°C in reduction temperature and was accompanied by an increase in the butanal selectivity with a small increase in butanol selectivity. From the study of the effect of the reduction temperature on the performance of this catalyst, it could be concluded that the optimum temperature for reduction was 350°C where the highest activity and the best selectivity for crotyl alcohol were obtained. As a matter of fact the selectivity depends very much on the conversion; therefore, the selectivity dependence on the conversion was worth investigating. So the high selectivity to crotyl alcohol obtained on the catalyst calcined at 400°C and reduced at 350°C and the fact that the high selectivity was independent of the time on stream, allowed hydrogenation experiments to be repeated with changing the spatial velocity in a way that a series of selectivity for the different products at different conversions were obtained. Then an experimental curve representing the variation of the selectivity in a wide range of conversion was drawn (Fig. 6 ). It was remarkable that the crotyl alcohol selectivity decreased slowly and remained higher than 77% up to 55% conversion, where at the same time the selectivity to butanol was slightly rising as the conversion was increased. The rates at which the two opposed processes took place were equal, which showed that the crotyl alcohol was partly converted to butanol when the conversion was increased. Selectivities to butanal and hydrocarbons did not seem to be affected. On the other hand, extrapolation of the crotyl alcohol selectivity curve to very small conversions shows that the higher limit in the crotyl alcohol selectivity is over 90%. 3.2.3 Effect of the reaction temperature A set of other experiments was also performed on this catalyst when the reaction temperature was varied in order to gain some information on the thermochemistry of the reaction over this catalyst and to obtain overall activation energy for this process. The activation energy calculated in the stable regime in 80–180°C reaction temperature range for the total process was 44kJ/mol. This value was higher than that reported for the same reaction, 21kJ/mol on Pt/ZnO [8] and Pt/TiO2 high temperature reduction (HTR) [28], but comparable to the one found on Au/TiO2 (38kJ/mol) [29]. In this latter case, this high activation energy was associated with the hydrogen dissociation reaction as the determining step of the whole hydrogenation process."
8,Reduction of the precursors seen by colour changes,"3.3 Reduction of the precursors seen by colour changes The colour of the in situ reduced catalysts was examined through the glass reactor under hydrogen at the end of the reduction period before starting the catalytic test. During reduction, over the temperature range used, the black initial phase due to the Co3O4 on the 400°C calcined precursor was maintained because as black cobalt metal was formed. Except when the catalyst was reduced at 275°C where the initial phase changed to an olive-greenwich brown CoO phase. So at this stage and because of the low reduction temperature, it suggested that the catalyst was not fully reduced and was blocked at the first stage of the whole reduction process (see TPR results). This suggests that there was no metallic cobalt formed. When the catalyst was subjected to the hydrogenation, low activity was seen (Fig. 4) which was interpreted by the existence of metallic cobalt in a small amount when compared to the unreduced phase. The lack of sufficient metallic cobalt to bring about enough hydrogen dissociation needed for the reaction led to a lower activity. Sexton et al. [30], reported on the colour change during the reduction of Co3O4. It was shown by X-ray diffraction taken for the samples before and after the first stage of reduction, that cobalt was present as Co3O4 and CoO, respectively [31]."
9,Temperature programmed reduction (TPR),"3.4 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) The effect of the conditions of calcination on the reducibility are represented in Fig. 7 . 3.4.1 The 400°C calcined precursor For the 400°C calcined precursor, analysis of the profile showed that, this precursor started to be reduced at 280°C and was totally reduced at 800°C. In this reduction cycle, it was well clear that the reduction profile consisted of three peaks. The first one was at 410°C, the second at 558°C and the third at 773°C. The three peaks were different in intensities. The total hydrogen uptake, taken from the calibration is 232ml/g of catalyst. Because of the small overlap between the first and the second peak, a deconvolution treatment was performed using a Gaussian multi-fit. The fractions of hydrogen uptake corresponding to the first and the second peak, respectively, are 1/4 and 3/4, while that seen at higher temperature was very low hydrogen consumption. It was well established [25,30–33] that supported and unsupported Co3O4 which is the most stable form of cobalt oxides exhibited two reduction peaks which were due to reduction of Co3O4 phase in a two-step process according to: Co3O4 +H2 →3CoO+H2O(stageone) 3CoO+3H2 →3Co+3H2O(stagetwo) The temperatures at which these two processes took place in supported Co3O4 were not fixed. The second peak maximum temperature which represents the slow process (1–2h) at 300°C, but rapid (<1h) at 400°C [30] was the most affected by the nature of the salt used, the support and the preparation technique used [33]. In our sample, a 25% hydrogen consumption for the low temperature peak was a good agreement with the initial reduction of Co3O4 to CoO. The second peak in the TPR profile must correspond to the reduction of CoO or phases containing stoichiometry Co:O=1 to the metal. This result agreed well with the XRD results as far as the identification of the cobalt phase in the 400°C calcined precursor was concerned. The Co3O4 species were formed during the air calcination through the decomposition–oxidation of CoCO3 existing in the precursor. The small peak at high temperatures could be related to the reduction of cobalt silicates. 3.4.2 Non-calcined precursor No crystalline phase was observed on this precursor when analysed by XRD. Its TPR profile had a different shape when compared to that of the 400°C calcined. The reduction of this precursor was a nearly one-stage process taking place at 455°C since only a very small peak was observed at around 335°C. The amount of hydrogen consumed by this reduction represented 3/4 of the total hydrogen consumed by the precursor calcined at 400°C and which is equal to that of the main peak of this later which represented the second stage of Co3O4 reduction. So it can be deduced that the TPR profile of the non-calcined precursor was mainly represented by the reduction of CoO to Co. The decomposition of the basic cobalt carbonate would lead to CoO formation. It should be noticed that the temperature at which the reduction of this CoO species was taking place at nearly 100°C lower than that observed with the 400°C calcined precursor. 3.4.3 The 550°C calcined precursor When the TPR profile of the 550°C calcined precursor was compared to that of the 400°C calcined one, we noticed a great difference in the shape. The peaks of the 550°C calcined precursor were not well defined, but still we could distinguish the low temperature peak at 431°C. But the second peak was wide, flat and spread over a wider temperature range. In other words, it had lost in height and gained in width. The total hydrogen uptake of this precursor was similar to that observed on the 400°C calcined precursor. This suggested that the amount of the species reduced was the same for the two precursors. From the XRD studies it was concluded that both phases consisted of Co3O4. So this difference in the reduction behaviour could be associated to the state of interaction which was may be different as a consequence of the calcination temperatures. Silica is seen as a non-reducible support, thought of as a weakly interacting material for metal catalysis. Nonetheless, if the entire catalyst preparation and thermal treatment cycles were taken into consideration, the interactions between metal ions, either in solution or solid could be formed. It would have an important influence on the reducibility of the metal and on the behaviour of the finished catalyst. Many workers have confirmed this and worked on it. In 1980, Paryjczak et al. [34] found that supported cobalt oxide Co3O4 to be more difficult to reduce than pure Co3O4. Reducibility increased at higher cobalt loading. The same observation was made on cobalt oxide deposited on Kieselghur [31]. Although, there was nearly general agreement that silica-supported cobalt compounds were more difficult to reduce than the corresponding pure compounds, little is known about the nature of the interactions or the extent of the interactions between cobalt ions and silica. Nor much is known about the effects of these interactions on the catalytic behaviour of the resulting silica-supported catalysts. Some authors attributed the difficulty in reduction to the formation of cobalt silicates; others proposed a more subtle interaction. Barth et al. [35] suggested that strongly interacting cobalt ions were incorporated into the silica surface. In our case, when compared to the non-calcined precursor, it seems that the calcination in air did not only convert the CoCO3 to Co3O4 but brought some extra strength to the existing interactions between cobalt and silica as well, thus resulting in a higher reduction temperature. The 550°C calcination temperature seemed to be high for the cobalt species to remain in the same state of interactions as the one observed at 400°C. If the interactions were destroyed by chemical reaction such as those taking place during severe calcination (550°C), the reduction step will be easier and then, when reduced at 350°C, no remaining cobalt oxide would be observed. van Steen et al. [33] observed that by calcination up to 400°C, the strongly bonded cobalt species were destroyed on impregnated cobalt–silica catalyst. In our case, the strength of the interactions seemed to be higher because the reduction of the three precursors took place at higher temperatures (Fig. 7) when compared with impregnated cobalt–silica catalyst and probably this was associated with the method of preparation by precipitation. This suggested that during the preparation, cobalt ions interacted with silica at elevated pH 9. The interaction was strong enough to inhibit subsequent cobalt reduction at lower temperatures. 3.4.4 Degree of reduction of the catalysts In the catalytic test, the reduction of the precursor was done in situ. Measurements of the degree of reduction in these conditions practically were not feasible. So the TPR apparatus has served for this purpose but using a different sequence from that used in the previous TPR measurements. For this, the precursor was treated in the same conditions as those used in the catalytic reactor. 100% H2 under atmospheric pressure was used to reduce 20mg of the precursor in the TPR reactor at the appropriate temperature for 2h, after which the material was cooled down in hydrogen to room temperature. Without any air contact, it will undergo a TPR cycle in 1.52% H2/Ar. In Fig. 8 are represented the TPR profiles for the following catalysts: calcined 400°C, reduced 350°C; calcined 550°C, reduced 350°C; non-calcined, reduced 350°C and calcined 400°C, reduced 500°C. In order to evaluate the amount of the reduced cobalt, we defined the degree of reduction as being the % of the reduced cobalt at the end of the reduction period to the total of the cobalt species present and which were reducible at temperatures lower than those corresponding to the reduction of silicates. This should be represented by the ratio of the hydrogen consumed after reduction to that which was consumed by the calcined and non-calcined precursors when subjected directly to TPR analysis, and the results were summarised below: Catalyst Degree of reduction (%) Calcined 400°C, reduced 350°C 90 Non-calcined, reduced 350°C 90 Calcined 550°C, reduced 350°C 100 Calcined 400°C, reduced 500°C 100 It came out that the non-calcined and the 400°C calcined precursors when reduced for 2h at 350°C presented a 10% remaining cobalt oxide. The peak maxima for the two profiles were observed at 445°C. When this was taken into consideration and compared to those observed in Fig. 7, it could be deduced that these peaks corresponded to the reduction of remaining CoO. On the other hand, the 550°C calcined when reduced at 350°C as well as the 400°C calcined when reduced at 500°C did not present any hydrogen uptake in that temperature range. Smaller hydrogen uptake for these two was observed at higher temperatures and which had been associated with cobalt silicates reduction. So it was clear that the non-calcined and the 400°C calcined precursors when reduced at 350°C for 2h were not completely reduced. Some remaining cobalt oxide was present with the metal. Some authors have reported on the coexistence of metallic cobalt and its oxides after reduction of Co3O4. Potoczna-Petru and Kepiński [36], in a reduction study of non-supported Co3O4 model catalysts using electron microscopy, found that the existence and the nature of the remaining cobalt oxide after H2 reduction depended on the particle size and the reduction temperature. On specially designed silica supported catalysts used for the (CO+H2) reaction, Ernst et al. [37] showed that, after 500°C reduction, the initial Co3O4 spinel structure was not completely reduced. They suggested that the small unreduced CoII was associated with the existence of cobalt silicate formed during the reduction by a reaction of CoO with silica. Llorca et al. [38] have reported on the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO and small particles of Co and their importance in the ethanol-steam reforming for the H2 production. The most striking observation was that, when we looked back at the performance of these catalysts in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (Figs. 3 and 5) the non-completely reduced catalysts showed high selectivity to crotyl alcohol. But on the fully reduced catalysts, crotyl alcohol selectivity was lower, but that of butanal was high. Activity was seen to vary in the opposite way to the crotyl alcohol selectivity mainly on the catalyst calcined at 550°C and reduced at 350°C (Figs. 2 and 3) but not very remarkable on the catalyst calcined 400°C and reduced at 500°C. So these results showed the existence of a link between the cobalt oxide remaining after reduction and the crotyl alcohol selectivity. The cobalt oxide left seemed to be responsible for the high crotyl alcohol selectivity. But someone should not forget that the TPR measurements were mainly related to the bulk behaviour, and the catalytic ones were associated to the surface properties. This was the reason why XPS studies were performed on the catalysts in order to identify the surface phases."
10,XPS measurements,"3.5 XPS measurements The XPS measurements represented in Figs. 9 and 10 and summarized in Table 1 indicated the Co 2p binding energy and the value of the atomic ratios of cobalt in different electronic states obtained after the fitting procedure. In Fig. 9 a set of the Co 2p XPS spectra corresponding to the calcined 400°C, calcined 550°C and the non-calcined precursors were presented. The series was characterised by two main peaks separated by a spin-orbit splitting just above 15eV and two associated low intensity satellites located at the high energy binding side of the main peaks for the calcined 400°C and the calcined 550°C. It could be seen within experimental error that neither the line shape nor the BE position of any feature in the two spectra changed with the calcination temperature. According to the literature, spectra similar to those were typical of cobalt in cobalt oxide Co3O4 [39]. On the other hand the spectra of the non-calcined, even though it had similar line shape, presented some differences when compared to the calcined 400°C and the calcined 550°C. The whole spectrum was slightly shifted to higher BE. On top of this, the doublet was separated by 15.8eV. The satellites were seen to be stronger than those observed on the calcined 400°C and calcined 550°C. According to the literature [39], spectra similar to this were typical of CoO or CoII in general. The non-calcined precursor consisted of the basic carbonate deposited in the preparation stage. So it could be assumed that the XPS values were those corresponding to CoII. As shown in Fig. 10, another series of XPS spectra were obtained on the 400°C calcined, 550°C calcined and the non-calcined precursors after reduction at 350°C as well as that corresponding to the calcined 400°C and reduced 500°C. On these spectra metallic cobalt was easily observed at a binding energy slightly higher than 777eV (Table 1), with a spin-orbit splitting just above 15eV. This is more pronounced with the precursors calcined at 550°C, reduced at 350°C and the calcined 400°C, reduced at 500°C where only metallic cobalt, Co0, was observed. On the 400°C calcined and non-calcined, peaks associated with the presence of the oxide form of the Co were present as well. So, for these later two, the analysis showed the coexistence of Co metallic and the oxide at the surface of the particles. XPS results were in good agreement with TPR results (Fig. 8) where remaining cobalt oxide was detected. Even though, the amount of the unreduced cobalt observed on the non-calcined and the 400°C calcined catalyst in TPR analysis after their reduction was only 10%, the signal associated with this species in the XPS analysis (Table 1) was quite strong mainly for the non-calcined. When this was compared to that of the dominating metal phase (90% measured in TPR), let suggest that, it was most likely that the cobalt oxide phase was situated at the surface of the particles rather that being embedded in the metal matrix. Details of the elementary steps of Co3O4 reduction were obtained from HRTEM and SAED study in Ref. [36]. Coexisting phases of Co, CoO and Co3O4 could be seen as well as their mutual crystallographic orientation. It was concluded in this study that, the growth of CoO during reduction of Co3O4 occurred in an epitaxial manner on Co3O4 with CoO(111) planes parallel to Co3O4(111). In the next stage the CoO was reduced and again epitaxial growth with Co(111) parallel to CoO(111) was observed. These results evidenced that the three phases could be present at the same time on the same particle, even though smaller particles were found to reduce easily to metallic cobalt. In our situation large particles were obtained (Fig. 1), in which complete reduction was not observed when the thermal treatments used were not severe. The catalyst, calcined at 400°C and reduced at 350°C, showed similar images (Fig. 1) as those shown in Ref. [36] with numerous stacking defects and the existence of the different phases of metal and cobalt oxide."
11,Comments on the reaction mechanism and conclusions,"The relative amounts of butanal and crotyl alcohol depended strongly on the calcination and the reduction temperature which suggests that the nature of the catalytic sites is related to the thermal treatments of the catalyst. On top of this, the activity was found to depend on the thermal treatments as well, where highest activities were observed when the catalyst was activated under severe conditions. In addition, it has been shown that the surface chemical composition of the catalyst was varying with the thermal treatments, and two situations had to be distinguished: the first was that the catalyst surface consisted of coexisting cobalt and cobalt oxide, in the second, only metallic cobalt was observed when severe conditions were used in the activation of the catalyst. In the case where only metallic cobalt was observed at the surface, it can be assumed that the catalytic sites are metallic ones. The high activity observed on the catalyst calcined 550°C and reduced at 350°C can be explained by the rate of dissociation of hydrogen. As a matter of fact, the metallic surface generates enough atomic hydrogen to supply the reaction transition state of the adsorbed crotonaldehyde molecule resulting in higher rates in hydrogenation. Probably the same observation can be made on the catalyst calcined 400°C and reduced 500°C but to a lower extend because of the particle size which was thought to be higher. Conversely, when moderate conditions are used to activate the catalyst, coexisting cobalt and cobalt oxide at the surface were observed. The fine structure of the coexisting species has been discussed earlier but in our case no experimental work was undertaken for a closer look on this aspect of the structure. Even though, the nature of the remaining oxide was not identified, it is accused to be at the origin of the high selectivity to crotyl alcohol. As discussed before (1st paragraph), no crotonaldehyde hydrogenation was observed on the oxide form of cobalt even at reaction temperature as high as 160°C. But after reduction in the moderate conditions, the remaining cobalt oxide plays a major role in bringing in high crotyl alcohol selectivity. Therefore, we rather propose a single mode of crotonaldehyde adsorption which will govern the reaction to high crotyl alcohol selectivity where the CO hydrogenation will be favoured. It is tempting to conclude that the existence of partial electric charges resulting from polar bonds on the cobalt oxide leads the crotonaldehyde molecule to be adsorbed using the polar carbonyl group and fixed on the catalytic site in a special geometry which allows the CO to hydrogenate. At the same time, the existing sites would not adsorb the crotonaldehyde molecule by binding to the olefin bond. As oxides usually are not able to dissociate molecular hydrogen, we speculate the metallic cobalt will dissociate the hydrogen and by a spillover phenomenon will feed the adsorbed crotonaldehyde with atomic hydrogen. The apparent activation energy measured in the present study in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation on the catalyst calcined at 400°C and reduced at 350°C is 44kJ/mol. It could signify, as proposed on Au catalysts [29], that the activity is determined by the H2 dissociation step since, on platinum based catalysts where H2 dissociation is a non-activated process, the activation energy of crotonaldehyde hydrogenation is much lower. However, more investigation is necessary to confidently conclude on this point. At the end let us pay attention to the content of chlorine coming from the precursor and remaining on the catalyst after the pre-treatment. A small amount of chlorine still remained after 400°C calcination while it disappeared at higher temperature treatment, either under H2 or air (see Cl/Co ratio from XPS results in Table 1). In other words, the catalysts leading to a high crotyl alcohol selectivity contain a certain amount of chlorine while chlorine content is negligible on the catalysts giving a lower crotyl alcohol selectivity. When Nitta et al. [18] studied the effects of chlorine content in Co catalysts in liquid phase crotonaldehyde hydrogenation they observed a similar correlation between the chlorine content and the crotyl alcohol selectivity. This result pushed them to propose that the presence of chlorine is the factor which is responsible for the high crotyl alcohol selectivity, leading to a favourable metal cristallite size distribution during the reduction process and participating directly to the catalytic site. In our study, by varying the calcination and the reduction treatments, a clear correlation between the structure of the catalyst and its reactivity appeared leading us to propose that the most probable characteristic which induces a high crotyl alcohol selectivity is the presence of a certain amount of cobalt oxide besides cobalt metal. Therefore, the catalytic site for the carbonyl hydrogenation would be the paired metal-oxide site and the chlorine atoms would not play any direct role. This conclusion is in line with the one of Bailie et al. [21] reporting that the relative proportion of Co0Co0 and Co+Co0 available for CC and CO hydrogenation have a significant influence on the catalyst selectivity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation on Co deposited on alumina and silica. In their experiments the crotyl alcohol selectivity did not exceed 40%, but it is interesting to notice that they used a low loaded catalyst (5% metal) prepared from a nitrate precursor. Therefore, we can advance that all the parameters in the preparation method of Co catalysts are important to be controlled in order to get the suitable balance between oxide and metal forms of cobalt in the final state of the catalyst. Finally, it is worth to emphasize that the cobalt catalyst, presented in this work, competes favourably with the best platinum based catalysts using in selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde into unsaturated alcohol."
