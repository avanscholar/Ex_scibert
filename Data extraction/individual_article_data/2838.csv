0,Introduction,"The combustion of fossil fuels gives serious negative effects on the environment mainly because of the emissions of greenhouse gases (e.g., CO, CO2) and air pollutants (e.g., NOx, SOx and fly ash). For these reasons, many researchers have been searching new sustainable energy sources that could replace fossil fuels [1]. Biomass energy is a promising alternative to fossil fuels. It is produced by microbial conversion of biomass, such as agricultural, forestry, husbandry wastes or lignocellulosic materials to methane, hydrogen, ethanol, gasoline or biodiesel. In the past decades, hydrogen, the intermediate of anaerobic digestion process, has gained increasing attention since it is clean, efficient, and sustainable [2–4]. Biological hydrogen production is considered the most environmentally friendly way of producing energy [5–13]. Biological H2 production can be carried out by either photosynthetic microorganisms or fermentative anaerobes. Hydrogen fermentation process exhibits preference over phototrophic hydrogen production process in three aspects: (1) Simpler process on technical ground, (2) faster H2 production rates, (3) easier conversion of refuse or waste products into hydrogen, thereby facilitating waste recycling [3,4,14]. Therefore, dark fermentative hydrogen production seems to be the most commercially viable biological hydrogen production process [9–13]. Biodiesel, currently used as fuel in conventional diesel engines, is composed of ethyl esters produced from vegetable oils or animal fats [15]. Biodiesel has drawn much attention recently due to several advantages over petroleum-based diesel, such as favorable energy balance, lower harmful emissions and nontoxic [16]. Biodiesel can be produced through transesterification catalyzed by chemical catalysts (e.g., NaOH or metal oxides) or by enzymes (e.g., lipase). Regardless of chemical or enzymatic biodiesel synthesis process, significant amount of glycerol will be generated as a main by-product [17,18], resulting in a significant decrease in market price of glycerol. Therefore, finding a feasible way for the reutilization of the massive amount of glycerol generated from biodiesel industry has become a hot issue [19–22]. Glycerol serves as an excellent substrate for fermentation industry, as it is often fermentatively converted to 1,3-propanediol for making polyesters [23,24]. Using this wasted glycerol for clean energy (e.g., H2) production is also very attractive since this waste-to-energy concept is able to significantly enhance the overall economic benefits of bioenergy processes and human sustainability. However, conversion of glycerol into biohydrogen has been much less studied when compared with biohydrogen production from carbohydrate-based feedstocks [19–22,25]. The metabolisms for dark fermentative H2 production from carbohydrate-based and glycerol-based feedstock with Clostridium pasteurianum were a bit different, as the major metabolites of C. pasteurianum when using sugars as substrate are butyrate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, whereas 1,3-propandiol, butanol, butyrate, acetate, lactate and ethanol become dominant metabolites when using glycerol as carbon source [26,27]. In this study, the H2 fermentation performance from glycerol by using seven pure bacterial isolates was evaluated and compared. The H2-producing strains examined (i.e., Clostridium butyricum CGS2 and CGS5, C. pasteurianum CH1, CH4, CH5, CH7 and Klebsiella sp. HE1) were isolated from high-rate H2-producing bioreactors and were shown to possess high biohydrogen-producing efficiencies [9,28–30]. Optimal conditions for the bioH2 yield and productivity of those H2-fermentative bacteria were determined when using waste glycerol from biodiesel synthesis processes as the substrate."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacterial strains and cultivation medium,"2.1 Bacterial strains and cultivation medium The H2-producing bacterial strains used in this study were isolated from effluent sludge of a continuous dark fermentation bioreactor capable of producing H2 from synthetic wastewater containing sucrose (20 g COD/l) or xylose (20–40 g COD/l) as the sole carbon source as well as sufficient inorganic supplements [1,10,30]. The detailed procedures for the strain isolation and identification were described in our recent work [10]. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of C. butyricum CGS2, C. butyricum CGS5, C. pasteurianum CH1, C. pasteurianum CH4, C. pasteurianum CH5, C. pasteurianum CH7 and Klebsiella sp. HE1 used in this study has been deposited in the NCBI nucleotide database under the following accession number: AY540106 (strain CGS2), AY540109 (strain CGS5), EF140980 (strain CH1), EF140981 (strain CH4), EF140982 (strain CH5), EF140983 (strain CH7) and AY540111 (HE1). The pure strains were pre-cultured under anaerobic conditions [10] on the medium consisting of (g/l): glycerol, 15; (NH4)2SO4, 3.0; Na2HPO4, 5.0; KH2PO4, 1.0; NaCl, 2.0; MgSO4, 0.1; Na2S·9H2O, 0.5. The H2-producing medium used for assimilating glycerol (HMG medium) consisted of (g/l): glycerol, (adjustable); NH4HCO3, 6.72; NaHCO3, 5.24; K2HPO4, 0.125; MgCl2·6H2O, 0.1; MnSO4·6H2O, 0.015; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.025; CuSO4·5H2O, 0.005; CoCl2·5H2O, 1.25 × 10−4; yeast extract, 1.0; casamino acid, 1.0; l-cystein·HCl, 0.5; sodium thioglycolate, 0.5."
3,Procedures of batch and continuous hydrogen fermentation,"2.2 Procedures of batch and continuous hydrogen fermentation Batch fermentation was carried out by incubation in sealed serum bottles. The medium for dark H2 fermentation was HMG medium as indicated in the preceding section. The initial glycerol concentration was adjusted to 1.0–40.0 g/l for the kinetic studies. The batch culture was conducted under different physical conditions: culture temperature, 30–50 °C; initial pH, 5.0–9.0; agitation rate, 0–200 rpm. During the course of fermentation, cell concentration, residual glycerol concentration, and production of biogas and soluble metabolites were monitored with respect to culture time. Continuous bioH2 production from glycerol feedstock was conducted with a continuous stirred tank bioreactor using C. pasteurianum CH4 as the bioH2 producer. The operating conditions used to evaluate the feasibility of the continuous culture were: temperature, 35 °C; hydraulic retention time (HRT), 12 h; pH, uncontrolled; glycerol concentration (crude glycerol and pure glycerol), 10 g/l. During the course of fermentation, cell concentration, pH, residual glycerol concentration, and production of biogas and soluble metabolites were monitored with respect to culture time."
4,Data analysis,"2.3 Data analysis Time-course data of cumulative H2 production were simulated by modified Gompertz equation (Eqn. (1)) [10,11,31–33] and the kinetic parameters were estimated via Sigma Plot 10.0 (SPSS Inc., Point Richmond, USA). (1) H = H max exp { − exp [ R max , H 2 × e H max ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where, H denotes cumulative H2 production (ml), H max denotes maximum cumulative H2 production (ml), R max denotes maximum H2 production rate (ml/h), t denotes culture time (h), and λ denotes the lag time required for the onset of H2 evolution (h)."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The gas products (mainly H2 and CO2) were analyzed by gas chromatography (Model 9800, China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan) using a thermal conductivity detector. The carrier gas was argon. The column (inner diameter = 2.159 mm; height = 4 m) was packed with Porapak Q (China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan) [34]. The volatile fatty acids and ethanol were also detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC equipped with a refraction index detector (RID-10A, Waters, USA) was also used to detect sucrose, volatile fatty acid and ethanol in the filtered (0.2 mm) supernatant of culture broth during bioH2 production. The column used in HPLC analysis was an ICSep ICE-COREGEL 87H3 column (Transgenomic, USA). The mobile phase was 0.008 N·H2SO4 with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The injection sample volume was 20 ml and the column temperature was controlled at 70 °C. Cell concentration in the culture was determined by optical density measurement at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600) using a spectrophotometer (model U-2001, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The OD600 values were then converted to dry cell weight concentration via proper calibration [34]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Batch bioH2 production from glycerol using pure bacterial isolates,"3.1 Batch bioH2 production from glycerol using pure bacterial isolates BioH2 production efficiency from glycerol was investigated using seven pure H2-producing bacteria (namely, C. butyricum CGS2, C. butyricum CGS5, C. pasteurianum CH1, C. pasteurianum CH4, C. pasteurianum CH5, C. pasteurianum CH7, and Klebsiella sp. HE1) under a glycerol concentration of 16.4 g/l (20 g COD/l), an initial pH of 7.5, and a temperature of 37 °C. The results show that C. butyricum CGS2 and C. butyricum CGS5 could not use glycerol to produce H2, while C. pasteurianum CH1, CH4, CH5, CH7 and Klebsiella sp. HE1 could produce H2 when using glycerol as the sole carbon source (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ). Therefore, the ability of using glycerol for bioH2 production seems to be strain dependent. Clostridial strains and some other bacterial strains have been shown to be capable of converting glycerol into H2 via dark fermentation, such as C. butyricum [35], C. pasteurianum [35], Enterobacter aerogenes [16] and Klebsiella pneumoniae [36]. The theoretical maximum H2 yield when using glycerol as carbon source is 1.0 mol H2/mol glycerol [16]. In this study, the most effective strain for converting glycerol to bioH2 was C. pasteurianum CH4, which gave a maximum H2 production rate, maximum cumulative H2 production and H2 yield of 226.0 ml/h/l, 3226 ml/l, and 0.74 mol H2/mol glycerol, respectively, under the batch culture conditions (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The major soluble metabolites produced along with the batch dark H2 fermentation were 1.3-propanediol (1,3-PDO), butanol, ethanol, lactate, acetate (Table 2 ). Although the soluble metabolites profiles seem to be strain dependent, there is a clear trend that the formation of alcohols (butanol and ethanol) or diols (1.3-PDO) was predominant over acids (acetate and butyrate) production (Table 2) when using glycerol as the sole carbon source. This metabolites profile is quite different from that obtained by using carbohydrate-based carbon source, in which acids formation is usually dominant [26,35]. However, literature shows that it is quite common that Klebsiella sp. and C. pasteurianum strains produce a significant amount of 1,3-PDO when using glycerol as sole carbon source [37,38]."
8,Effect of environmental conditions on bioH2 production from glycerol,"3.2 Effect of environmental conditions on bioH2 production from glycerol Since C. pasteurianum CH4 exhibited the best bioH2 production performance on glycerol during the batch tests shown above (Table 1 and Fig. 1), the effects of environmental conditions, like temperature, initial pH and agitation rate, on the efficiency of H2 production were investigated to determine the optimal operation conditions. According to the results illustrated in Fig. 2 , the maximum H2 production rate (249.8 ml/h/l) and maximum H2 yield (0.93 mol H2/mol glycerol) were observed at 35 °C, initial pH 7.0 and agitation rate 200 rpm, respectively. In contrast, C. pasteurianum CH4 was unable to grow or produce bioH2 when the temperature was higher than 50 °C or the initial pH was too low (<5.0) or too high (>9.0) (Fig. 2). Those results shown above indicate that glycerol could be converted into H2 efficiently via dark fermentation with C. pasteurianum CH4 under the optimal conditions (i.e., temperature, 35 °C; initial pH, 7.0; agitation rate, 200 rpm)."
9,Kinetics of cell growth and H2 production using glycerol as sole carbon source,"3.3 Kinetics of cell growth and H2 production using glycerol as sole carbon source Understanding the kinetics of cell growth and bioH2 production is essential for the design and scale-up of the bioprocess used for bioH2 production from glycerol [10,39]. Unfortunately, very little work has been devoted to identifying such kinetic characteristics, especially for H2 production form glycerol. In this work, kinetic studies were conducted to obtain kinetic properties of cell growth and H2 production of C. pasteurianum CH4 on glycerol. For this purpose, the effect of glycerol concentration (1.0–40.0 g/l) on H2 production was examined on batch mode. Fig. 3 shows that C. pasteurianum CH4 could produce bioH2 at initial glycerol concentrations ranging from 1.0 g/l to 40.0 g/l and the H2 production rate increased with an increase in glycerol concentration. The optimal initial glycerol concentration was 10.0 g/l, giving a H2 production rate of about 256.8 ml/h/l. However, the H2 yield from glycerol increased when glycerol concentration increased from 1.0 to 10.0 g/l, while it slightly decreased when the glycerol concentration was further increased from 20.0 g/l to 40.0 g/l (Fig. 3). Thus, the H2 yield was optimal (1.11 mol H2/mol glycerol) at an initial glycerol concentration of 10.0 g/l. The H2 content initially increased with increasing glycerol concentration, while it reached a maximum level of 57% after glycerol concentration was higher than 10.0 g/l (Fig. 3). The glycerol utilization efficiency was always nearly 100% regardless of the glycerol concentration used (data not shown). Based on the data shown in Fig. 3, the dependence of cell growth rate of C. pasteurianum CH4 on initial glycerol concentration was drawn in Fig. 4 a and the profile was described with Monod-type kinetic model (Eqn. (2)) indicated below. (2) μ = μ max S K S + S where μ denotes the specific growth rate (h−1), S denotes carbon substrate concentration (g/l), μ max denotes the maximum specific growth rate (h−1), and K S denotes the half-saturation constant (g/l). The Monod-type model fitted the experimental results very well with a R 2 value of 0.969 (Fig. 4a). The estimated parameters for the Monod-type model (i.e., μ max and K S) were 0.18 h−1 and 2.43 g/l, respectively. In addition, the dependence of H2 production rate on glycerol concentration was also described by Michaelis–Menten (M–M) model (Eqn. (3)) as indicated in Fig. 4b. The M–M model is able to describe the experimental data quite well with a R 2 value of 0.991 (Fig. 4b). (3) v = v max S K m + S where v represents the specific H2 production rate (ml/h/l), v max represents the maximum H2 production rate (ml/h/l), K m represents the Michaelis constant (g/l). The estimated values of ν max and K m from M–M model were 352.31 ml/h/l and 4.77 g/l, respectively. Those kinetic parameters obtained from this work could be useful for the design of large-scale bioH2-producing bioreactor using glycerol as substrate."
10,Continuous H2 fermentation using pure or crude glycerol as sole carbon source,"3.4 Continuous H2 fermentation using pure or crude glycerol as sole carbon source The continuous culture of C. pasteurianum CH4 was conducted to assess the performance of continuous bioH2 production using pure glycerol and the crude glycerol obtained from biodiesel industry. The continuous fermentation was conducted under a temperature of 35 °C, an HRT of 12 h, and a feeding glycerol concentration of 10 g/l. When pure glycerol was used as the carbon source, the C. pasteurianum CH4 culture could be operated stably on continuous mode (Fig. 5 ). The average H2 content, H2 production rate and H2 yield were 78.3 ± 1.0%, 103.1 ± 8.1 ml/h/l and 0.50 ± 0.02 mol H2/mol glycerol (Fig. 5). The average glycerol utilization and cell concentration was 99.29 ± 0.33% and 0.79 ± 0.24 g/l, respectively, over the operation period. The major soluble metabolic products were 1.3-PDO, butyrate, butanol, acetate and lactate (Table 3 ). On the other hand, when the biodiesel by-product (i.e., crude glycerol) was used as carbon source, the culture could also be operated stably on continuous mode (Fig. 6 ). Since the waste glycerol from biodiesel manufacturer contained an average glycerol concentrate of 615.4 ± 2.1 g/l, the crude glycerol was diluted to maintain a constant feeding glycerol concentration of 10 g/l. The average H2 production rate and H2 yield were 166.0 ± 8.7 ml/h/l and 0.77 ± 0.05 mol H2/mol glycerol. The average H2 content in biogas was about 72.71 ± 2.4%. The average glycerol utilization and cell concentration were 97.36 ± 2.59% and 0.60 ± 0.14 g/l, respectively, over the operation period. The major soluble metabolic products were 1.3-propandiol, butyrate, butanol, acetate and lactate (Table 3). The soluble metabolite profile obtained from continuous fermentation is similar to that from batch cultures, except for a higher butyrate and lactate content in the continuous culture. Comparison of the results shown in Figs. 5 and 6 indicates that the bioH2 production performance from using crude glycerol seems to be better than using pure glycerol. This could be attributed to the impurities in crude glycerol, such as phosphates (used for separating glycerol from biodiesel waste) [40], which could stimulate hydrogen production of C. pasteurianum CH4. Moreover, since most of the glycerol-driven bioH2 production studies reported in the literature were operated on batch mode [16,26,35,36,41], the results obtained from this work are of importance for the understanding of the behavior of continuous hydrogen fermentation using glycerol as sole carbon source. In addition, the H2 production yield obtained from steady-state operation of the continuous culture is higher or comparable to most of the performance reported in the literature (Table 4 ). This demonstrates the feasibility of converting the by-product (glycerol) of biodiesel synthesis processes into clean hydrogen energy using the specific isolated H2-producing bacterium, C. pasteurianum CH4."
11,Conclusions,"Seven isolated H2-producing strains were examined for their ability to use glycerol as carbon source for dark fermentative H2 production. The best glycerol-driven bioH2 production performance belonged to C. pasteurianum CH4. Using batch culture with the optimal conditions (temperature, 35 °C; initial pH, 7.0; agitation rate, 200 rpm; glycerol concentration, 10 g/l), the CH4 strain could obtain a H2 production rate and a H2 yield of 256.8 ml/h/l and 0.41 mol H2/mol glycerol, respectively. When switching to the continuous mode with a constant feeding of pure and crude glycerol (feeding at a concentration of 10 g/l) with C. pasteurianum CH4 was also evaluated. The continuous culture gave an average H2 production rate of 103.1 ml/h/l (pure glycerol) and 166.0 ml/h/l (crude glycerol), and a H2 yield of 0.50 mol H2/mol glycerol (pure glycerol) and 0.77 mol H2/mol glycerol (crude glycerol). The performance of glycerol-based bioH2 production obtained from this work is better or comparable to those reported in the literature. The technology developed from this research can help recycle the by-product of biodiesel manufacturing process and convert it to clean energy. This appears to meet the goal of biorefinery and sustainability."
