0,Introduction,"Even though U.S. oil production has boomed in recent years due to hydraulic fracturing, the need for petroleum-free routes to value-added chemicals will continue to intensify in the future when carbon building blocks become increasingly scarce. Lower olefins (C2–C4), primarily produced today by steam cracking, are key building blocks in the chemical industry, with ethylene being the largest volume petrochemical produced worldwide at approximately 80million metric tons per year [1]. Another versatile petrochemical is propylene, with 40 million metric tons produced every year. The demand for olefins will continue to increase, with propylene demand expected to exceed production capacity, inevitably requiring the development of alternative routes to olefins. Syngas is a versatile chemical feedstock that can be produced from coal, biomass, methane, and mixtures thereof, with commercial technologies. Syngas-based processes to olefins include long-chain hydrocarbon cracking, methanol-to-olefin conversion (MTO), and higher alcohol (C2–C4) dehydration. Two of these building blocks are currently commercially produced from syngas: methanol over Cu-based catalysts [1] and long-chain hydrocarbons over Fischer–Tropsch (FT) catalysts [2]. However, there is no commercially viable catalyst to produce higher alcohols from syngas. Higher alcohol synthesis has been investigated with different families of heterogeneous catalysts including noble metal Rh-based catalysts [3–11], modified Cu-based methanol synthesis catalysts [12–16], and modified FT catalysts based on Co, Ru, and Fe [5,8,17–19]. A particularly promising non-noble metal family of catalysts, MoS2-based catalysts modified with potassium [20,21], has been widely studied due to its resistance to sulfur poisoning, less severe coke deposition, and ability to form higher alcohols with a high selectivity to ethanol. However, MoS2-based catalysts are less active than noble metal catalysts and require higher pressures to achieve reasonable productivities. Supported MoS2 catalysts have also been widely studied as means to improve higher alcohol selectivity and productivity using SiO2, TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, CeO2, and a variety of carbons as supports [22–25]. Further studies were performed with activated carbon [26–32] and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) [17–19,33–36] as supports that enhanced productivity due to higher dispersion of MoS2 domains. These studies showed that catalytic activity is enhanced by dispersing the MoS2 over a support and that Mo–support interactions can affect the reactivity and product distribution of the catalyst by facilitating alcohol reaction pathways. Recently, Morrill et al. [37,38] developed new potassium promoted MoS2 catalysts supported on a mixed Mg/Al oxide (MMO) support, derived from a hydrotalcite, that strongly perturbed the product distribution toward higher alcohols. The intrinsically basic properties of the support were suggested to promote alcohol-forming reactions, unlike common acidic γ-alumina [39–42] known to promote alcohol dehydration and subsequent hydrocarbon formation. The studies indicated that MMO supports yielded high C3+OH selectivity influenced by Mo–MMO interactions, but generally also yielded low catalytic productivity. It has further been shown that the Mo:MMO ratio greatly affected the reaction selectivity, while catalyst preparation methods had little impact on this parameter [38]. It was also observed that low Mo loading, resulting in enhanced higher alcohol selectivity, could be correlated with highly dispersed, smaller MoS2 domains with few stacked layers. Chianelli et al. previously investigated the effect of the degree of MoS2 stacking on selectivity for hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reactions [43]. The proposed “Rim-Edge model” described the catalyst as a stack of several disks, with the top and bottom disks associated with rim sites and the disks in between associated with edge sites. The results showed that hydrogenation reactions occurred on rim sites only, whereas HDS reactions occurred on both rim and edge sites. Based on this model, it is hypothesized that CO hydrogenation reactions over K/MoS2 supported on MMO should primarily occur on rim sites. Furthermore, Morrill et al. noted that carbon supports yielded high methanol and ethanol selectivities [37]. Previous work on mesoporous carbon, prepared at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), yielded catalysts with greater alcohol productivity than similar catalysts supported on a commercial activated carbon [32,44,45]. In this work, we seek to evaluate the hypotheses that molybdenum supported on a mixed support comprised of MMO and mesoporous activated carbon may allow for elevated higher alcohol productivity (due to MoS2 domains on the carbon support) and good higher alcohol selectivity (due to MoS2 domains on the MMO support), with an emphasis on understanding the MoS2 structure–reactivity relationships over the carbon/MMO composite supported catalysts. A particular focus is placed on determining the effect of the support on MoS2 structure, as well as the mobility of Mo species on the two supports under reaction conditions."
1,Experimental section,"Mesoporous activated carbon was prepared via a published procedure developed at ORNL. Mesoporous carbon was synthesized by carbonization of nanostructured polymers, obtained by self-assembly of block copolymer and phenolic resin under acidic conditions via soft-template method, under flowing N2 at 850°C for 2h. The mesoporous carbon was then activated with KOH and subsequently washed by dilute HCl to remove residual KOH. For KOH activation, a physical mixture of solid KOH (16g) and mesoporous carbon (4g) was loaded to a quartz tube in a nickel crucible and heated under flowing N2 to 900°C and held for 2h. The resulting material was washed with deionized water and then mixed with a ∼0.2M HCl solution that was then heated up to 80°C with stirring for 30min. The activated mesoporous activated carbon was collected by filtration, washed with deionized water, and dried at 100°C [46]. MMO was synthesized using the same method described in our previous studies [37,38] by coprecipitation of magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Alfa Aesar, 98–102%), and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Alfa Aesar, 98–102%) aqueous solutions with a Mg:Al molar ratio of 7:3 (0.6M in metal ions) together with a 1.2M NaOH (EMD, 97.0%) and 0.15M Na2CO3 (Aldrich, 99.5+%) at 65°C and a pH of 9.5. The resulting solution was stirred for 48h, filtered, washed with deionized water, dried overnight at 105°C, and then calcined at 450°C for 2h. A set of four catalysts using a mixture of mesoporous activated carbon (C) and MMO supports was synthesized with an approximate Mo loading of 5wt.%, K loading of 3wt.%, and a molar ratio of Mo:K of 1. The parent catalysts in this study, which are derived from a single support, are referred to as MoKMMO and MoKC. The mixed supported catalysts in this study are referred to as MoKC-MMO and MoKMMO-C, where the parent catalyst is first prepared and is ground with the bare secondary support in a mass ratio of MMO:C of 3.6 to yield the final precatalysts (Fig. 1 ). Mo0.15K0.09C was used as the parent catalyst for MoKC-MMO, and Mo0.06K0.04MMO was used as the parent catalyst of MoKMMO-C, so that when ground with the secondary support the desired Mo and K loadings were achieved. The precatalysts were then pressed into pellets for catalyst testing in the fixed bed reactor. MoKMMO was pelletized to ∼3000 psig, whereas mixed supported catalysts (MoKMMO-C and MoKC-MMO) were pelletized at ∼6000 psig to obtain self-supporting pellets. In Table S1 in the Supporting Information, it is shown that upon pelletization the MMO and MMO-C supports lose ∼20% of their surface area, and ∼10% of their pore volume. Therefore, there is no considerable decrease in porosity upon pelletization. Mo was added to the supports via incipient wetness impregnation using ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (AMT) (Sigma–Aldrich, ACS Reagent) dissolved in DMSO for the MMO support (the solution was stirred for 12h until AMT was dissolved) and water for the carbon support. DMSO was used as the impregnation solvent for MMO instead of water to limit the recrystallization of the hydrotalcite phase, which can be induced by water, thereby “burying” the potassium promoter [14,47,48]. The resulting materials were dried in open atmosphere at 135°C for 12h for the MMO support and at 100°C for 12h for the carbon support, and then placed in a quartz tube, whereby the AMT was decomposed via heating to 200°C for 6h at 5°C/min, followed by further heating to 450°C for 2h at 5°C/min under 40mL/min of flowing N2. After the decomposition step, the parent oxide precatalysts were physically ground for 15min with K2CO3 (Aldrich, 99%, stored in an oven at 105°C) [49]. For the mixed supported catalysts, the parent catalyst was ground for an additional 15min with the secondary support to create the precatalysts with mixed supports. The prepared precatalysts containing MMO were pelletized, crushed, and sieved through 20–40 mesh prior to loading in the reactor, while for MoKC, silicon carbide (Alfa Aesar, 46 grit SiC) was mixed with the powder catalyst (but not ground) in a 5:1 SiC:catalyst mass ratio to minimize plugging and hot spots, as self-supporting pellets could not be fully formed with the carbon-rich catalyst. It is important to note that SiC is inert under the reaction conditions, as verified with a blank, SiC-only, reaction. The precatalysts were then loaded into a 6.35-mm steel tube reactor (1g for MoKMMO, 0.8g for the mixed supported catalysts, and 0.4g for MoKC) for catalytic evaluation. The precatalyst bed was then pretreated with 10% H2S/H2 (Matheson Tri-Gas, UHP) at 450°C at a heating rate of 5°C/min and then held at 450°C for 2h with a flow rate of 20mL/min to reduce the oxide precatalyst to the sulfide phase, in situ. After in situ sulfidation, the reactions with syngas, 45% H2 (Airgas, UHP), 45% CO (Airgas, UHP, purified with 5A molecular sieve carbonyl trap), 10% N2 (Airgas, UHP) as an internal standard, and 50ppm H2S (from 5000ppm H2S in He, Matheson Tri-Gas, UHP) were carried out at 310°C and 1500 psig at flow rates 10–60mL/min (700–6500mL/gcatalyst/h) to reach 3–4 different steady state, isothermal CO conversion levels for a total of ∼12days of time onstream. All the catalysts studied reached the first isothermal CO conversion after 3days of reaction, as shown in Fig. S1. For the 2–3 additional isothermal CO conversion levels studied in each run, reactions were carried out until the productivity and product selectivity were stabilized for ∼3days. H2S was added to the syngas feed to prevent sulfur leaching and maintain steady state sulfur levels on the surface of the catalyst to ensure catalyst stability. No major change in activity was observed during ∼12days of reaction, with less than 10% change in the CO conversion observed over this period. Please note that significant safety precautions are required to study toxic (CO, H2S) and flammable (H2, CO, H2S) gases under high pressure and temperature. The main reaction products were quantified with an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph (methane, ethane, ethylene, carbon dioxide, propane/propylene, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, isobutyl alcohol, acetaldehyde, methyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl propionate, and ethyl propionate) using single-point calibration curves. CO conversion, productivity, and reaction selectivity were calculated from pseudo-steady-state data. At the completion of the reactions, all catalysts were passivated in situ with 1% O2 in He (Matheson Trigas, UHP) for 8h at room temperature at 20mL/min. Catalysts were then placed in a vial under argon and stored in a desiccator. The reaction-aged catalysts were characterized ex situ via elemental analysis, nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) including the near-edge and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (XANES and EXAFS), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). In addition, the carbon and MMO supports were characterized with nitrogen physisorption, and ammonia and carbon dioxide temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. Elemental analysis was performed at ALS Environmental; for carbon analysis, the samples were directly analyzed using Perkin Elmer 2400 II (combustion/thermal conductivity), for metal analysis the samples were first digested in a microwave (Anton Paar Multiwave 3000) with nitric, hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, and peroxide, and the analysis was performed with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using Perkin Elmer Optima 3000 DV. Nitrogen physisorption isotherms were collected at −196°C using Micromeritics Tristar II after being heated to 200°C under vacuum for 10h prior to the analysis. Ammonia and carbon dioxide experiments were conducted on an AutoChem II 2920 instrument from Micromeritics. Approximately 35mg of the sample was placed in a quartz U-tube, which was mounted on the instrument. For Ammonia TPD experiments, the sample was pretreated under a helium atmosphere by heating to 500°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. Ammonia gas (1984ppm in He) was introduced into the tube for one hour after cooling the sample to 120°C. The system was then purged with helium for one hour at 120°C. The TPD profile was recorded until the temperature reached 800°C in helium flow at a heating rate of 10°C/min. A similar procedure was followed for carbon dioxide TPD experiments; and the sample (∼35mg) was pretreated under a helium atmosphere by heating to 700°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. CO2 gas (99.99%) was introduced into the tube for one hour after cooling down the sample to 50°C. The system was then purged with helium for 30min at 50°C. The TPD profile was recorded to 700°C in helium flow at a heating rate of 10°C/min. XRD was performed using a Philips X-pert diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. A Witec confocal Raman microscope (Alpha 300R) was used to obtain Raman spectra for the reaction-aged catalysts with an Ar+ ion laser (λ =513.998nm) with 1.5mW excitation source intensity and 1800 grading with <0.9cm−1 pixel resolution. Bulk MoS2, molybdenum(IV) sulfide, purum, powder (Aldrich) was used as a reference material. Samples for STEM imaging were prepared by dispersing the particles in methanol and dropping them on a lacy carbon-coated Cu grid. Images were collected on an aberration-corrected JEOL 2200FS STEM operated at 200kV at ORNL. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS and XANES) was performed at beamlines 10-BM-A and 12-BM of the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, and beamline X18B of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory. The XAS data were obtained in transmission mode at the Mo K-edge (20keV) with a spot size of 0.5mm×1.2mm at APS and 0.5mm×5mm at NSLS. The Mo K-edge spectra were measured at room temperature in air with Mo foil as an energy reference. The reaction-aged catalysts were ground with boron nitride (99%, Sigma–Aldrich) and loaded into a polyamide tube (0.16 in. I.D.) to obtain an attenuation length of approximately one. Two scans from 19,800 to 21,000eV were collected for each sample. The XAS data were then processed with Athena software for background removal, edge-step normalization, and Fourier transform."
2,Results and discussion,"XRD patterns of the reaction-aged catalysts after passivation are shown in Fig. 2 . Small, relatively broad peaks for the MoS2 [101] (33°) and [110] (58°) planes were observed in all of the reaction-aged catalysts. The MoS2 [002] plane at 14° was observed for MoKC, MoKC-MMO, and MoKMMO-C, but was absent in MoKMMO. The presence of the [002] plane in the carbon-containing catalysts could be indicative of a higher degree of MoS2 stacking compared to MoKMMO [50]. Diffraction lines characteristic of the MgO at 44° and 64° were apparent in all MMO-containing catalysts. It is important to note that the carbon-containing catalysts exhibited a diffraction line at 26°, corresponding to MoO2 domains. Additional peaks at 37°, 44°, and 53° were also characteristic of MoO2 domains in the MoKC catalyst. The presence of MoO2 domains in carbon-containing catalysts is most likely attributed to incomplete reduction during in situ sulfidation. N2 physisorption isotherms of the mixed supported reaction-aged catalysts shown in Fig. S3 depict a double hysteresis due to a bimodal pore-size distribution (∼34nm due to the macroporous MMO support and ∼10nm due to the mesoporous carbon support) calculated with the Barret–Joyner Halenda (BJH) model. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas calculated from the nitrogen physisorption data of the mixed supported catalysts were substantially smaller than those from the carbon supported catalyst due to the presence of the relatively low surface area MMO support (Table 1 ). This observation is consistent with the work of Dalai et al., where they observed a significant decrease in porosity upon binder incorporation to the CoRhMoS2, MWCNT supported catalysts as a means of enhancing pelletization for industrial applications [51]. Elemental analysis results shown in Table 1 confirm that the catalysts were prepared within 10% of the target Mo and K wt.% loadings. It has been previously observed that the Mo:MMO mass ratio greatly affected catalyst selectivity [38]. Therefore, maintaining the Mo:MMO mass ratio for the MMO supported catalysts allows for meaningful comparison of the catalytic performance across the family of catalysts. Similarly, a constant MMO:C mass ratio for the mixed supported catalysts was used to shed light into the Mo mobility between the two support phases in the mixed supported catalysts, as it is thought that Mo species are highly mobile during sulfidation and possibly the early stages of the catalytic reaction [52]. It should also be noted that the mass ratio of Mo/S was similar among all the catalysts and minor deviations did not follow any specific trend for the catalysts studied. The reactivity results for the family of carbon and MMO supported K/MoS2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . Linear alcohol and total hydrocarbon selectivity, as well as C2+ alcohol productivity (C2+OH), are plotted against CO conversion. Selectivities are quantified on a CO2-free basis for a clear depiction of higher alcohol synthesis, since CO2 selectivities over these catalysts are high, due to water–gas shift reactions facilitated over MoS2-based catalysts (Table S2) [53–56]. A second set of catalysts prepared from different batches of MMO and C supports was prepared and reacted to ensure the reactivity trends were consistent and reproducible. The second set of catalyst’s reactivity trends are shown in Fig. S4. The total non-alcohol oxygenate (acetaldehyde, methyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl propionate, and ethyl propionate) selectivities for all the catalysts in this study were less than 3% (Table S2), indicating that primarily linear alcohols were the oxygenates formed over these catalysts. As previously observed, MoKC was primarily selective toward methanol and ethanol, whereas MoKMMO shifted the product distribution from C1–C2 to C2–C4 linear alcohols [37]. It was observed in this work that the MoKMMO catalyst had the highest C3+OH selectivity, as expected, whereas the MoKC catalyst had the lowest C3+OH selectivity but showed improved C2+OH productivity compared to MoKMMO. The enhanced C2+OH productivity over the MoKC catalyst may be associated with the acidic nature of the carbon support, as suggested from NH3 TPD (Fig. S5a), supported by the work of Liakakou et al. correlating increased CO conversion with increased acidity of a similar catalyst (K-NiMo supported on acid pretreated activated carbon) [32]. The C3+OH selectivity trend for the MoKC-MMO catalyst was between that of the MoKMMO and MoKC parent catalysts (Fig. 3), suggesting that some of the Mo was able to move from the originally (Mo) impregnated carbon support to the MMO support during sulfidation and reaction, creating a catalyst that was more selective toward C3+OH, characteristic of the Mo domains on the MMO support. Unlike what was observed in the work by Dalai et al. upon binder incorporation into a CoRhMoS2/MWCNT catalyst, the addition of the intrinsically basic MMO support to MoKC resulted in increased C3+OH selectivity instead of a significant reduction of total alcohol selectivity [51]. It is particularly striking to note that the MoKC-MMO catalyst gave the highest alcohol productivity in this family of catalysts with more than a twofold increase in C2+OH productivity compared to that of the related MoKMMO and MoKMMO-C catalysts. In contrast, the MoKMMO-C catalyst had selectivity and productivity trends similar to MoKMMO, suggesting that the strong Mo–MMO interactions created when Mo was originally impregnated on MMO limited the ability of Mo to migrate to the carbon support under reaction conditions. It is important to note that the MoKMMO-C catalyst had a slightly higher total hydrocarbon selectivity, resulting in slightly lower C2+OH selectivity when compared to the MoKMMO catalyst. The addition of the acidic carbon support to MoKMMO to create MoKMMO-C resulted in increased hydrocarbon formation by promoting dehydration/hydrogenation reactions [32,57]. The Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) distribution for linear alcohols and linear hydrocarbons is shown in Fig. S6. Consistent with the selectivity trends, the catalysts where Mo was initially contained on the MMO (MoKMMO and MoKMMO-C) had higher linear alcohol chain growth probabilities (α =0.49) followed by the MoKC-MMO and MoKC catalysts. The MoKMMO material had the lowest alpha value for linear hydrocarbons, whereas the carbon-containing catalysts (MoKC, MoKMMO-C, and MoKC-MMO) had increased alpha values. The MoKMMO-C catalyst had the highest alpha value (0.41) for linear hydrocarbons, consistent with higher hydrocarbon formation due to the acidic nature of the carbon support, as discussed above. Approximate turnover frequencies (TOFs) for C2+OH, and total hydrocarbons (HC), based on CO conversions are provided in Fig. S7 and Table S4. A lower bound (LB) TOF estimate is provided, assuming all Mo atoms are active sites. In addition, a middle estimate (ME) of the TOF is provided, assuming all edge atoms are active. Consistent with the productivity trends, the catalysts where Mo was initially contained on the MMO support (MoKMMO and MoKMMO-C) had lower ME TOFs at 5 % CO conversion (5.0 and 5.7h−1, respectively) compared to catalysts whereby Mo was initially contained on the carbon support (MoKC (11.1h−1) and MoKC-MMO (13.7h−1)). These values are an order of magnitude lower than values obtained for rhodium catalysts at similar reaction conditions, as shown in Table S5, as expected. Mo–support interactions not only seem to affect Mo mobility, but also may facilitate certain reaction pathways. Mg/Al mixed oxides (MMO) can facilitate Guerbet coupling reactions due to their acid–base pairs, where the Lewis acidic Al is thought to stabilize the aldehyde and ketone intermediates [58]. It can be observed in Fig. 3 that in MMO-containing catalysts, ethanol selectivity decreased with increasing conversion, while 1-butanol selectivities increased, suggesting that ethanol self-coupling may be an important secondary reaction over these catalysts. Even though MoS2 is acidic in nature and the presence of potassium increases the basicity of the catalyst (creating the possibility of having both acid and base sites), the carbon support lacks the base sites present in MMO (Fig. S5b), and therefore, this trend was not observed over MoKC. Furthermore, isobutyl alcohol selectivity, an indicator of methanol+1-propanol coupling reactions, was measurably lower over MoKC than MoKMMO, as shown in Table S2. Further experiments need to be conducted to investigate the importance of coupling pathways over these catalysts, which will be the subject of a subsequent investigation. To gain a deeper understanding of these reactivity trends, it was necessary to explore the structural properties of the catalysts and how these properties affected the productivities and selectivities. The modification of MoS2-based catalysts with potassium is well known to shift the product distribution from hydrocarbons to alcohols by inhibiting hydrocarbon formation, as shown in Fig. S8a [59]. Unpromoted MoC and MoMMO catalysts were compared to promoted MoKC and MoKMMO catalysts. MoC and MoMMO catalysts were mainly selective toward hydrocarbons, and upon K promotion their selectivity shifted from hydrocarbons to higher alcohols. The MoC material was not active toward higher alcohols (C2+OH productivity was close to zero), whereas the MoMMO catalyst showed similar C2+OH productivity compared to MoKMMO, as the intrinsically basic MMO support facilitated higher alcohol formation. Therefore, modification with potassium over the MMO supported catalysts affects only the selectivity of the catalyst by inhibiting hydrocarbon formation, without increasing the rate of alcohol formation. Additionally, potassium is thought to play a role in the active sites for production of alcohols [21,60–63]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis shown in Table S6 demonstrates that there was a decrease in sulfur content between the MoMMO and MoKMMO catalysts, which may be attributed to sulfur vacancies created when potassium intercalates in the MoS2 stacked layers, which may inhibit hydrocarbon formation. This hypothesis is supported by the work of Beltrami et al., where they correlated the sulfur loss (anionic vacancies) observed over an unsupported Ni/MoS2 catalyst to the promotion of higher alcohol formation [64]. It has also been observed in the literature that alkali metal intercalates between the layers of MoS2 [65–69], which are held together by van der Waals forces, and this weak binding force allows the interlayer gap to increase to accept alkali metal ions. Raman spectra shown in Fig. 4 of the MoKMMO and MoKMMO-C materials depict two bands at 379.5 and 401.5cm−1, which correspond to ν(E1 2g) and ν(A1g) MoS2 vibrational modes, respectively. The MoKC-MMO catalyst showed similar bands shifted to higher frequencies, 380.6cm−1 for ν(E1 2g) and 402.4cm−1 for ν(A1g) vibrational modes. Similar to the MoKMMO and MoKMMO-C materials, the bulk MoS2 commercial standard had a band at 379.5cm−1 corresponding to ν(E1 2g), but the ν(A1g) band was shifted to 405.1cm−1, suggesting that the interlayer distance between the MoS2 stacked layers was smaller than the MMO and carbon supported MoS2 catalysts [70]. This difference may be caused by a lesser degree of MoS2 stacking in the supported catalysts compared to the bulk MoS2 material, resulting in a less compact MoS2 domain [71] and/or by K intercalation between the MoS2 stacked layers [67]. Fig. S8b shows that promoted catalysts had a longer induction period compared to unpromoted catalysts, which may be attributed to potassium intercalating in the MoS2 structure [60]. The shift to higher frequencies observed in the MoKC-MMO catalyst compared to the MoKMMO and MoKMMO-C catalysts can be attributed to the increased number of MoS2 domains with 3+ layers, as observed from STEM (Fig. 6a) and discussed below, that have smaller interlayer distance compared to MoS2 domains with mainly double layers (larger interlayer distance) present in MoKMMO and MoKMMO-C [71]. In contrast to the above materials, the Raman spectra for the MoKC material showed no Mo-S vibration bands, as MoKC was mainly comprised of single layers with highly dispersed Mo, as observed by STEM imaging, and described below. Additionally, it should be noted that the lack of Mo-S vibration bands for the MoKC catalyst is likely not associated with spectral fluorescence because a higher Mo content supported on the carbon showed these bands clearly (data not shown). High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM imaging was used as the primary means to characterize the MoS2 domain size and [002] layer stacking in the various materials. A total of 790 STEM images were analyzed to determine the fraction of MoS2 stacked layers in each sample of this family of catalysts, taking into account over 240 MoS2 domains for each of the MoKC, MoKC-MMO, and MoKMMO-C catalysts and 150 MoS2 domains for the MoKMMO catalyst (a similar MoKMMO catalyst was characterized previously by STEM [38]) The number of MoS2 [002] stacked layers was quantified as single, double, triple, and 3+ layers, as exemplified in Fig. 5 , and the percentage of MoS2 [002] layers as a function of the total number of layers for each catalyst is quantified in Fig. 6 a. It should be noted that domains with fewer MoS2 stacked layers (1–3 layers) were generally shorter in length than the domains with 3+ layers, among all the catalysts studied. Analogous to the MoKMMO sample and consistent with the work of Morrill et al. [38], the MoKMMO-C catalyst contained mainly double MoS2 layers (Fig. 6a), consistent with reactivity trends selective toward C3+ alcohols, as described above. Fig. 6b shows that as the number of double layers increased, the C3+OH selectivity increases. Dorokhov et al. observed a similar trend over K/MoS2 supported on γ-Al2O3-SiO2, where the total alcohol yield increased with an increasing fraction of 2+ layers, with double layers being the dominant domain size [68]. MoKMMO and MoKMMO-C had the highest fraction of double layers with correspondingly higher C3+OH selectivity, followed by MoKC-MMO, and MoKC having the lowest C3+OH selectivity with lowest fraction of double layers. This trend suggests that K/MoS2 interactions with MMO play an important role in the formation of higher alcohols, as strong support–Mo interactions limit the growth of the number of MoS2 stacked layers, compared to carbon supported MoKC and MoKC-MMO catalysts that had a significant amount of 3+ layers due to weaker Mo–carbon interactions. It can be further inferred that the MoKC catalyst had predominately single layers (without potassium intercalation, which is not possible for a single layer), which facilitate hydrocarbon formation. This is in agreement with the rim–edge model, where rim sites are responsible for hydrocarbon formation and single layers only possess rim sites [43]. Fig. 6b further supports that single Mo rim sites correlate with production of hydrocarbons, as the selectivity for total hydrocarbons increased with an increase in the percentage of single layers present in the catalysts, as also observed by Dorokhov et al. [68]. The MMO-containing catalysts had a significantly lower fraction of single layers, supporting the low selectivity of these catalysts toward hydrocarbons. A detailed analysis of domains comprised of 3+ layers and the MoO2 domains, which were also present over the MoKC catalyst, was necessary to provide further insight into the single-layer domain formation and their effect on hydrocarbon formation. Fig. S12a shows that MoKC formed domains with 3+ layers in the proximity of MoO2 domains, suggesting that MoO2 domains supply Mo species for growth of nearby domains of 3+ MoS2 layers. However, not all the MoO2 domains were fully reduced to form MoS2 stacked layers under the conditions used, as further supported by the peaks associated with crystalline MoO2 domains observed in the XRD pattern of MoKC (Fig. 2). Increasing the Mo and K loading to 15 and 9wt.%, respectively, over a carbon support (Mo0.15K0.09C), resulted in the formation of predominantly domains with 3+ layers, as shown in Fig. S15, suggesting that clustering of Mo species is necessary for the formation of highly stacked MoS2 domains. Therefore, it is hypothesized that single layers over MoKC are formed due to the highly dispersed Mo species across the support (due to low Mo, K loading) that do not agglomerate to grow beyond the critical nucleus size necessary for growth of MoS2 stacked layers, compared to Mo0.15K0.09C with higher Mo and K loading. The XRD pattern of the higher loading Mo0.15K0.09C material, shown in Fig. S16, exhibited a MoO2 diffraction line at 26°, also present in MoKC, further supporting that the presence of MoO2 domains contributed to the formation of MoS2 stacked layers and likely not single layers. In addition, the MoKC precatalyst in oxide form, without undergoing in situ sulfidation, was selective toward methanol and ethanol (see Table S2) when reacted supporting the notion that the MoO2 domains do not strongly influence hydrocarbon formation under the conditions employed and that single-layer MoS2 domains were likely responsible for hydrocarbon formation. Additionally, it should be noted that the MoKC-MMO sample had a more even distribution of 2, 3, and 3+ MoS2 stacked layers, supporting the observation that the selectivity trends for this catalyst were in between that of the MoKMMO and MoKC samples, as noted above, yielding a catalyst that was both active and selective to higher alcohols. This is consistent with our original hypothesis, whereby the MMO supported domains were suggested to provide sites that could yield good higher alcohol selectivity due to strong Mo–MMO interactions that limit the growth of stacked layers, and carbon supported domains would more effectively activate the hydrogen and carbon monoxide, yielding higher reaction rates due to weak Mo–C interactions that facilitate Mo dispersion across the supports. It should be noted that these correlating observations, however, do not necessarily prove causality, and it is unclear at this stage whether reaction intermediates from carbon supported domains migrate and further react on MMO supported domains. As mentioned above, the Mo0.15K0.09C catalyst showed increased MoS2 [002] stacking with an increase in loading compared to the Mo0.05K0.03C material. This increase in stacking resulted in an increase in C2+OH selectivity and productivity, as shown in Table S7. MMO supported catalysts showed an increase in stacking with increase in loading as well, similar to the C support. However, the catalyst with a lower Mo loading with fewer stacked layers was more selective toward C2+OH and more productive toward C3+OH [38]. It is hypothesized that intimate contact between the K/MoS2 domains and MMO has a synergistic effect in the formation of higher alcohols. To further investigate the reactivity trends observed for the mixed supported catalysts, the MoKC-MMO and MoKMMO-C samples were subjected to different reaction times onstream followed by STEM characterization to quantify changes of MoS2 domain size as a function of reaction time. The MoKC-MMO catalyst underwent a significant change in the layer distribution as shown in Fig. 7 a. After ex situ sulfidation but without catalytic reaction, the catalyst possessed mainly double layers, but during the transient period at the initial stages of the catalytic reaction, the layer distribution shifted to 3 and 3+ layers, and the sample was comprised of mainly 3+ layers when the catalyst reached steady state. It is important to note that the layer distribution of MoKC-MMO at steady state was similar to that of the reaction-aged Mo0.15K0.09C shown in Fig. S15, which suggests the majority of the Mo species formed large clusters (3+ layers) on the carbon when the reaction approached steady state. This observation is consistent with the MoKC-MMO preparation, where the Mo0.15K0.09C oxide precatalyst was ground with the bare MMO, suggesting that MoKC-MMO will possess largely 3+ layers, similar to Mo0.15K0.09C, before the bulk of the Mo species redistribution across the supports occurs (if the Mo species were mobile during reaction). The drastic shift in layer distribution observed for the reaction-aged MoKC-MMO indicates that the Mo species were in fact highly mobile during the reaction and redistributed between the carbon and MMO supports, as there was an even distribution of 1, 2, 3, and 3+ layer domains in the reaction-aged catalyst. The Mo species were able to redistribute effectively because they (relatively) weakly interacted with the parent carbon support compared to the MMO support. This Mo redistribution may allow vacancies or defects to be created on the MoS2 domains, resulting in higher productivity, as discussed above. On the other hand, the MoKMMO-C catalyst did not undergo any significant change in the layer distribution as the reaction progressed, as shown in Fig. 7b. This observation further supports the idea that when Mo was impregnated on the parent MMO support, the Mo species were more strongly bound to the MMO and were not significantly redistributed between the carbon and MMO supports during reaction, as with the MoKC-MMO counterpart. Additionally, Fig. 7c shows that the significant change in productivity over MoKC-MMO during the first three days of reaction can be attributed to the growth of MoS2 stacking. On the other hand, MoKMMO-C had no significant change in higher alcohol productivity (Fig. 7d) over the first three days of reaction, from ex situ to steady state, compared to MoKC-MMO, consistent with the lack of a change in layer distribution throughout the reaction. It is also interesting to note that the layer distributions for both the MoKC-MMO and MoKMMO-C samples that were ex situ sulfided but not reacted with syngas were comparably similar (Fig. 7a and b), indicating that the sulfidation process led to similar arrays of MoS2 domains in the absence of syngas. However, specific Mo–support interactions affected the spontaneous growth of the Mo domains under syngas conversion conditions. In the case of MoKMMO-C, strong Mo–MMO interactions prevented significant redistribution of the array of MoS2 stacked layers. In contrast, comparably weak Mo–C interactions in the MoKC-MMO catalyst facilitated significant redistribution of Mo and changed the array of MoS2 stacked layers. EXAFS spectroscopy was also used to shed light into the structure of the MoS2 layers present over the family of carbon and MMO supported catalysts. The Fourier transform k3-weighted Mo K-edge EXAFS spectra show that the supported catalysts had lower Mo-Mo coordination numbers compared to bulk MoS2, as the Mo-Mo peak intensity was far lower than the bulk MoS2 counterpart, as also observed by Morrill et al. [38]. Lower Mo–Mo coordination numbers compared to the bulk MoS2 may indicate monolayer defects created during the sulfidation and reaction. Among the catalysts studied, MoKC seemed to have the smallest Mo–Mo coordination number (Fig. S17), as expected due to high dispersion of Mo species on the carbon support, which contained many single-layer domains. The mixed supported catalysts (MoKC-MMO, MoKMMO-C) appeared to have Mo-Mo coordination numbers in between that of MoKMMO and MoKC, with MoKMMO having the highest Mo-Mo coordination number due to strong Mo–MMO interactions that limited the dispersion of the Mo species on the support. An assessment of the electronic structure of the MoS2 domains was inferred from XANES spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 8 [72]. Specifically, isosbestic points where the reaction-aged catalysts intersected bulk MoS2 were an indication that the reaction-aged catalysts had chemical states similar to that of bulk MoS2. Following the overlay of the XANES edges, it was unsurprising that the catalysts where Mo was originally impregnated on carbon (MoKC and MoKC-MMO in Fig. 8a) were similar to each other just as those supported on MMO (MoKMMO and MoKMMO-C in Fig. 8b) were similar as well. What is clear, however, is that the support interaction was quite subtle and that even though MoKC and MoKC-MMO had different isosbestic points from MoKMMO and MoKMMO-C (at 20,015eV and 20,005eV, respectively), with both sets being slightly different from bulk MoS2, all the catalysts studied had overall similar chemical signatures to that of the bulk MoS2. In addition, the normalized first derivative, shown in the inset of Fig. 8, offers further insight into the catalysts’ chemical state. The adsorption edge energy of MoKC and MoKC-MMO shifted to higher values compared to that of MoKMMO and MoKMMO-C samples, suggesting a higher average Mo oxidation state for the catalysts where Mo was originally impregnated on carbon. The shift in adsorption energy of the MoKC and MoKC-MMO samples may be associated with the MoO2 domains present after reaction, as seen in the XRD patterns in Fig. 2 and STEM images (Fig. S12). In addition, the spectra of the MoKC and MoKC-MMO catalysts, shown in Fig. 8, differed from that of bulk MoS2 in that they did not show the sharp feature at 20,010eV characteristic of bulk MoS2, and there was an increase of intensity in the tail of the edge just before the white line at (20,025eV). These differences further suggest that both the MoKC and MoKC-MMO catalysts were not fully reduced from the oxide phase to the sulfide phase [73,74]."
3,Conclusions,"Two distinct supports, a layered MMO material and a mesoporous activated carbon, were combined to tune the higher alcohol selectivity and productivity of K/MoS2 domains during syngas conversion. The reactivity and structural data compiled here are consistent with the hypothesis that Mo had the ability to migrate from the carbon support (where mobility was high) to the MMO support (where mobility was lower), creating in the case of the MoKC-MMO material a hybrid catalyst that was both productive and selective toward higher alcohols. In contrast, when the Mo was originally impregnated on the MMO support, Mo migration under reaction conditions was decreased, yielding a less active catalyst that behaved more like the parent MoKMMO material. The C3+OH selectivity over the family of catalysts was shown to correlate with the percentage of double [002] MoS2 layers present in reaction-aged catalysts. Strong Mo–MMO interactions in MoKMMO and MoKMMO-C, which contained mainly double layers, were thought to limit the growth of MoS2 stacked layers, resulting in the highest observed C3+OH selectivity over the catalysts studied. On the other hand, catalysts that contained many single [002] MoS2 layers, without potassium intercalation, were shown to be more selective toward hydrocarbons, with MoKC having the highest total hydrocarbon selectivity. The structure–reactivity relationships (MoS2 domain stacking vs. selectivity) explored in this work provide the basis for further investigations focused on understanding reaction pathways over these interesting catalysts."
