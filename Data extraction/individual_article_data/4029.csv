0,Introduction,"The soil is the habitat of a plethora of organisms, whose survival is dependent on the conditions surrounding them. Small changes can have a strong impact on these organisms (Shentu et al., 2008). The accumulation of toxic metals in the soil is one of the factors affecting soil organisms, including bacterial communities (Cardoso et al., 2017). In agricultural soils, cadmium (Cd) concentrations have been increasing due to farming practices focused on crop yield increase (Robertsa, 2014). The amount of available Cd in soils varies between 1.8 and 53 μM (Kabata-Pendias, 2010; Helmke et al., 1999; Nunes et al., 2018), however in contaminated soils the concentration can be much higher, reaching 2669 μM at highly contaminated sites (Nunes et al., 2018; Itoh and Yumura, 1979). Cd is a very toxic element even at low concentrations (Lima et al., 2006; Figueira et al., 2005) and is classified in seventh place in the 2017 Priority List of Hazardous Substances (ATSDR, 2017). Exposure to metals changes bacteria metabolism (Tremaroli et al., 2009). During this metabolic shift, bacteria alter their metabolome, including the volatilome (all the volatile metabolites synthesized by an organism) (Ebert and Halbfeld, 2016). Bacterial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are generally produced by catabolic pathways, including glycolysis, proteolysis and lipolysis, and belong to different chemical classes (e.g. terpenes, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, acids, nitrogen containing compounds or sulphur-containing compounds) (Penuelas and Sardans, 2009; Schulz and Dickschat, 2007). Several bacterial VOCs were shown to influence growth, differentiation and stress resistance in fungi, plants and invertebrates (Kai et al., 2009; Audrain et al., 2018; Effmert et al., 2012; Davis et al., 2013; Wenke et al., 2012). However, the influence of VOCs on bacteria is scarce and the existing studies prioritize pathogenic bacteria and fungi (Raza et al., 2015; Ossowicki et al., 2017) or model bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis (Kai et al., 2009; Farag et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2013). The volatilome of Rhizobium sp. strain E20-8 exposed to Cd was screened by Cardoso et al. (2017) and significant increases in the relative peak areas of saturated aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols of different sizes were detected. Aldehydes have been widely described as being toxic to humans (O'Brien et al., 2005), most information being related to α,β-unsaturated (Lopachin and Gavin, 2014), and little information being available on saturated aldehydes. Ishino et al. (2008) reported that H2O2 and to a lesser extent alkyl hydroperoxides are capable of mediating covalent modification of proteins by saturated aldehydes. Thus, saturated aldehydes in combination with H2O2 or ROOH (present at high concentrations in oxidatively stressed cells) may contribute to the modification of proteins and to cell damage under oxidative stress. As the toxicity of saturated aldehydes is poorly understood, further studies are required to elucidate the biological consequences of production of saturated aldehydes in cells under oxidative stress (Guéraud et al., 2010). Given the potentially harmful influence of aldehydes on cellular metabolism, transformation of aldehydes into less reactive or more water soluble (which can more easily be excreted) compounds can be efficient mechanisms to reduce the toxicity of aldehydes, such as the reduction of aldehydes to alcohols (Pizzimenti et al., 2013). A gene encoding an alcohol dehydrogenase was identified in Rhizobium (Willis and Walker, 1998; Sadowskyt and Bohloolt, 1986) and aldo-keto reductases, which also reduce aldehydes to alcohols (Pizzimenti et al., 2013), are a superfamily of enzymes found in a wide variety of organisms including bacteria (Ellis, 2002). The presence of these enzymes in bacteria may support the increase in saturated alcohols observed in cells of Rhizobium exposed to Cd (Cardoso et al., 2017). However, alcohols were also described to alter lipid bilayer properties, membrane function and protein function through direct interaction (Andersen and Ingo, 2011). Despite saturated aldehydes and alcohols increase in cells exposed to oxidative stress, their toxicity is largely unknown and most of the available information is on eukaryotic cells. Since the mechanisms triggered to counteract their toxicity are poorly understood, the present study was designed to elucidate the airborne effects of both saturated aldehydes and alcohols in bacterial cells exposed or not to metal induced stress. Moreover, this study also aims to mimic one of the alterations induced by Cd in Rhizobium cells, and to find out if reduction of aldehydes to alcohols can be a detoxification mechanism in bacterial cells. To achieve these goals, Rhizobium leguminosarum strain E20-8 cells were exposed to four saturated aldehydes and their corresponding alcohols at a wide range of concentrations (1 nM–100 mM) in the absence (no Cd) and presence of Cd (100 μM), in a total of 12 conditions per compound. The effects of each aldehyde and the corresponding alcohol on growth, membranes (lipid peroxidation), proteins (protein content and protein carbonylation), and antioxidant and biotransformation mechanisms (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferases) were determined and compared."
1,Material and methods,
2,Strain,"2.1 Strain Rhizobium sp. strain E20-8 (partial 16S rRNA sequence Genbank accession number KY491644), previously isolated from root nodules of Pisum sativum L. plants grown in a non-contaminated field in Southern Portugal and reported as tolerant to Cd (Lima et al., 2006; Figueira et al., 2005) was used in this work."
3,Chemicals,"2.2 Chemicals High-purity VOCs (>99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The chemicals used are the aldehydes and corresponding alcohols which increased in Rhizobium leguminosarum strain E20-8 (the same used in this study) exposed to Cd compared to control conditions (Cardoso et al., 2017). Aldehydes, alcohols and each compound were expressed as an acronym: AL (aldehydes); OL (alcohols); 6-al (hexanal); 6-ol (hexanol); 7-al (heptanal); 7-ol (heptanol); 8-al (octanal); 8-ol (octanol); 9-al (nonanal); 9-ol (nonanol)."
4,Cell culture and exposure to Cd and VOCs,"2.3 Cell culture and exposure to Cd and VOCs To perform the experiments on the effect of aldehydes and the corresponding alcohols on Rhizobium cells response to Cd exposure, the I-plate method was used (Kim et al., 2013) with some modifications. Eighteen colonies were inoculated on one side of the plate containing yeast extract mannitol agar (YMA) (control condition) or YMA supplemented with 100 μM CdCl2; on the other side of the I-plate, 10 μL of each chemical at different concentrations was applied to a sterile paper disk (Ø = 0.5 cm). Plates were incubated at 26 °C, during 60 h, with 3 independent replicates for each condition, with a total of 3 replicates x 2 Cd concentrations (0 and 100 μM) x 6 chemical concentrations (0 nM, 1 nM, 100 nM, 10 μM, 1 mM and 100 mM) x 8 compounds. The range of concentrations used was established taking into account the study of Kim et al. (2013). The bacterial colonies were harvested with a sterile spatula. The eighteen colonies growing on the same I-plate were pooled into a microtube, weighed and stored at −80 °C. The Cd concentration used imposed a growth inhibition of 50%. Aldehydes and alcohols stock solutions were prepared in 70% ethanol. Ethanol concentration used was confirmed to have no effect on rhizobia growth."
5,Biochemical parameters,"2.4 Biochemical parameters Frozen cells were suspended in specific extraction buffers, disrupted by sonication using an ultrasonic homogenizer U 200 S Control (IKA-WERKE), while keeping tubes in an ice bath, and centrifuged at 12,000×g for 10 min at 4 °C. For lipid peroxidation (LPO), samples were extracted with 20% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA). For superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), glutathione peroxidases (GPx) activity and protein content, sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate; 50 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate; 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate (EDTA); 1% (v/v) Triton X-100; 1% (v/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP); 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 7.0) was used. Total protein content was determined according to the Biuret method (Robinson and Hogden, 1940), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard (0–40 mg/mL). The absorbance was read at 540 nm. Results were expressed in mg of protein per g of bacteria (mg g−1). Lipid peroxidation (LPO) was measured by quantification of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), according to the method of Buege and Aust (1978). TBARS were quantified spectrophotometrically at 532 nm and calculated using the molar extinction coefficient of MDA (ε = 1.56 × 105 M−1 cm−1). Results were expressed in nmol of MDA equivalents per g of bacteria (nmol g −1). Protein carbonylation (PC) was measured by quantification of carbonyl groups (CG), according to the DNPH alkaline method described by Mesquita et al. (2014) with modifications (Udenigwe et al., 2016). The amount of CG was quantified spectrophotometrically at 450 nm (ε = 22.308 mM−1 cm−1) and results were expressed in μmol of CG per million cells (nmol g −1). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was determined based on the method of Beauchamp and Fridovich (1971) by the reaction of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) with superoxide radicals to form NBT diformazan. Absorbance was measured at 560 nm and SOD standards (0.25–60 U/mL) were used. One unit of SOD activity (U) corresponds to the amount of enzyme reuqired to inhibit by 50% the reduction of NBT. Results were expressed in units (U) per g of bacteria (U g−1). Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was determined based on the method of Paglia and Valentine (1967) with cumene hydroperoxide as substrate and using the glutathione reductase coupled assay to monitor the reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). NADPH was added to measure the basal rate of GSSG reduction by monitoring the absorbance at 340 nm for 5 min (ε = 0, 00622 μM−1 cm−1). GPx activity was expressed in mU per g of bacteria (mU g−1). Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) activity was determined following an adaptation of the method described by Habig et al. (1974). These enzymes catalyze the conjugation reaction of GSH with electrophilic substrates such as 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) (Corticeiro et al., 2013). GSTs activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (ε = 9.6 mM−1 cm−1) at intervals of 15 s during 20 min. The enzymatic activity was expressed in mU per g of bacteria (mU g−1)."
6,Data analysis,"2.5 Data analysis Hypothesis testing was performed by Permutation Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) (McArdle and Anderson, 2001). All analysis were performed with the software PRIMERv6 (Clarke and Gorley, 2006) with the add-on PERMANOVA+ (Anderson et al., 2008). A matrix was used to run the PERMANOVA tests, 9999 Monte Carlo permutations were considered. The pseudo-F values in the main tests were evaluated in terms of the significance and, when significant (p ≤ 0.05) pairwise comparisons were performed between conditions. Values of p ≤ 0.05 revealed if the groups differed significantly. The null hypotheses tested were: (a) for a given Cd level (presence or absence of Cd) and for each compound no significant differences exist among concentrations; (b) for a given concentration no significant differences exist between presence and absence of Cd. A matrix was used to calculate a Euclidean distance similarity matrix. The data used to calculate the matrix was previously transformed (fourth root). This similarity matrix was simplified through the calculation of the distance among centroids matrix based on the conditions, which was then submitted to ordination analysis, performed by Principal Coordinates (PCO). The heatmaps representing the biochemical parameters for each compound and condition were built using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (Chong et al., 2018). Data was normalized by weight of each replicate, and autoscaled by concentrations."
7,Results,The effects of four aldehydes and four alcohols separately or in combination with Cd are shown in Figs. 1–4 . In each figure the effect of an aldehyde and the corresponding alcohol is compared in the presence and absence of Cd.
8,Effects of hexanal and hexanol,"3.1 Effects of hexanal and hexanol In cells growing without Cd, hexanal did not cause growth differences at any of the concentrations tested (Fig. 1A). Hexanol also did not change cell growth at the two lower concentrations, but from 10 μM to 100 mM growth increased between 30 and 42% relatively to control. Cd significantly decreased cell growth. The effect of hexanal on growth was positive (but not statistically significant) compared to sole exposure to Cd at the three lowest concentrations, but this effect disappeared at higher concentrations. Hexanol was able to minimize the effects of Cd, with significantly higher growth than exposure to Cd alone (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S1). Heatmap analysis (Fig. 1B) evidenced Cd as the major driver of biochemical change in cells, inducing the activity of antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes, such as SOD, GPx and GSTs. However, exposure to volatile compounds such as hexanal and hexanol also induced biochemical changes in either the absence or presence of Cd. In the absence of Cd hexanal did not change protein levels, GSTs and SOD activity, increased PC and GPx activity and decreased LPO. Hexanol tended to decrease the activity of the three enzymes and cell damage (only significantly in membranes (LPO). In the presence of Cd hexanal influence on enzymes activity was contradictory, not affecting GSTs, decreasing GPx and increasing SOD activity. The presence of hexanal reduced the damage caused by Cd in proteins (only significant at 100 nM), but exacerbated membrane damage (200%) at higher concentrations. Hexanol decreased SOD and GPx activity, did not change GSTs activity, and reduced the cellular damage both in membranes (LPO) and in proteins (PC) induced by Cd (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S1). Principal Components Ordination (PCO) analysis of the biochemical determinants for each condition tested evidenced that together PCO1 and PCO2 explained 95.2% of the total variation obtained among conditions (Fig. 1C). Along PCO1 (61.5%), two groups were clearly separated, conditions without Cd on the positive side and conditions with Cd on the negative side of the axis. PCO2, explained 33.7% of total variation. In conditions without Cd, PCO2 separated the five conditions with hexanal (open triangles) on the negative side from conditions without VOCs or with hexanol (open circles) on the positive side of the axis. In conditions with Cd, PCO2 separated the conditions without VOCs or with hexanol (closed circles) on the negative side from conditions with hexanal (closed triangles) on the positive side. From PCO analysis it was possible to observe that most biochemical markers were strongly correlated with PCO1 and more related with Cd conditions, evidencing the effort of cells to fight oxidative stress imposed by exposure to Cd. LPO was more correlated with the three higher hexanal concentrations and Cd (red, pink and dark green closed triangles), evidencing the higher damage caused by the combined exposure to Cd and the higher hexanal concentrations on membranes. On the other hand, GPx was more correlated with the combined exposure to Cd and 1 nM, 1 mM and 100 mM hexanol (light green, pink and red closed circles, respectively) and with 100 nM and 10 μM hexanal (green and dark green open triangles, respectively), as evidenced by the higher GPx activity in these conditions (Fig. 1C)."
9,Effects of heptanal and heptanol,"3.2 Effects of heptanal and heptanol In cells growing without Cd, heptanal increased growth from 100 nM to 100 mM. Heptanol increased growth 43% at 100 nM, but for higher concentrations the growth stimulation was lower (24%–31%) but still significant (Fig. 2A). In the presence of Cd, the effect of both heptanal and heptanol was negligible (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S2). In the absence of Cd heptanal had little influence on enzymes activity, mixed influence (increases in some concentrations and decreases in others) on protein content and protein damage, and decreased membrane damage compared to control (Fig. 2B). Heptanol also had little influence on SOD and GSTs activity and on LPO levels, but decreased GPx activity, protein content and PC levels. In the presence of Cd, most parameters were not changed by heptanal (but proteins increased and GPx activity decreased), whereas heptanol increased enzymes activity and cell damage at most of the concentrations, especially protein at 100 mM (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S2). Principal Components Ordination (PCO) analysis evidenced that together PCO1 and PCO2 explained 97.8% of the total variation obtained among conditions (Fig. 2C). Along PCO1 (82.1% of total variation), three groups were clearly separated, conditions without Cd (open symbols) and conditions with Cd and heptanal (closed triangles) on the negative side, conditions only exposed to Cd (black closed triangle and circle) and to Cd and the lowest heptanol concentrations (light green and green closed circles) on the positive side but near the axis origin and conditions with Cd and highest heptanol concentrations (dark green, pink and red closed circles) on the far negative side of the axis. PCO2, explained 15.7% of total variation, and separated the five conditions with Cd and heptanal (closed triangles) and the condition with Cd and the highest heptanol concentration (red closed circle) on the positive side from the remaining conditions (without Cd – open symbols and with Cd and the four lowest heptanol concentrations – light green, green, dark green and pink closed circles) on the negative side of the axis. From PCO analysis it was possible to observe that most biochemical markers were strongly correlated with PCO1 and therefore more related with Cd and heptanol conditions. Among these, GPx was more correlated with 10 μM and 1 mM heptanol concentrations and Cd (pink and dark green closed circles), evidencing GPx activity as the main mechanism to fight the joint toxicity of Cd and heptanol. On the other hand, protein was strongly correlated with Cd and 100 mM heptanol (red closed circle), evidencing the metabolic effort of cells to tolerate this condition. (Fig. 2C)."
10,Effects of octanal and octanol,"3.3 Effects of octanal and octanol In cells growing without Cd, octanal did not cause significant growth differences at any of the concentrations tested although inhibitions around 10% were noticed at the lowest (1 nM and 100 nM) and highest (100 mM) concentrations and an increase of 11% was observed at 10 μM. Exposure to octanol displayed distinct influences, increases of up to 22% (10 μM) and decreases down to 20% (100 mM), that were only significant for 10 μM (Fig. 3A). In the presence of Cd, the effect of either octanal and octanol is minor (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S3). In the absence of Cd octanal did not damage cell membranes (LPO) or proteins (PC), enzymes activity was not affected either, only protein content decreased in most concentrations, yet increasing at 100 mM (Fig. 3B). Octanol also had little influence on the cytoplasm, but membrane damage (LPO) increased significantly at 100 mM. In the presence of Cd, octanal did not change enzymes activity, increased protein content and damage to both membranes and proteins. Octanol did not alter the cell damage inflicted by Cd, maintained SOD and GPx activity, decreased GSTs activity, and had a dual influence on the proteins, at nanomolar range decreased and at micro and millimolar concentrations increased protein content compared to Cd alone Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table S3). Principal Components Ordination (PCO) evidenced that together PCO1 and PCO2 explained 91.8% of the total variation obtained among conditions (Fig. 3C). Along PCO1, two groups were clearly separated, conditions without Cd on the positive side and conditions with Cd on the negative side of the axis. PCO2, explained 12.2% of total variation. In conditions without Cd, PCO2 separated three groups, the four lowest octanal concentrations (open triangles) on the positive side, the conditions without VOCs or with octanol (open circles) on the negative side but close to the axis origin, and the highest octanal concentration (red open triangle) on the far negative side of axis 2. In conditions with Cd, PCO2 separated the conditions without VOCs or with the highest octanol concentrations (dark green, pink and red closed circles) from conditions with octanal (closed triangles) and lowest octanol concentrations (light green and green closed circles). From PCO analysis it was possible to observe that most biochemical markers were strongly correlated with PCO1 and therefore more related with Cd conditions. The highest correlations were obtained for Cd and octanal conditions, evidencing that cells exposed to the combination of Cd and octanal were able to trigger a higher antioxidant response, but higher correlations were also obtained for LPO and PC (damage) (Fig. 3C)."
11,Effects of nonanal and nonanol,"3.4 Effects of nonanal and nonanol In cells growing without Cd nonanal did not cause growth differences in the three lowest concentrations, but growth decreased significantly (around 25%) at highest concentrations. Nonanol did not influenced growth at 1 nM, but higher concentrations increased growth significantly (25%–44%) (Fig. 4A). In Cd exposed cells nonanal did not change growth significantly. The five nonanol concentrations tested alleviated the negative effect of Cd on growth (28%–43%), although this influence was not statistically significant at 100 mM (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table S4). In the absence of Cd nonanal increased SOD and GSTs activity and PC levels, had a varied influence on GPx activity (at 100 nM increased and at 100 mM decreased), and decreased protein content. LPO only increased at 100 mM. Nonanol decreased the activity of the three enzymes and the protein damage, did not change protein content, and most concentrations increased LPO levels compared to control. In the presence of Cd, nonanal further increased all parameters at most of the concentrations used, especially LPO at higher concentrations. Nonanol decreased SOD activity, protein and PC levels, maintained GPx and GSTs activity and LPO levels compared to Cd alone (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table S4). Principal Components Ordination (PCO) analysis evidenced that together PCO1 and PCO2 explained 91.3% of the total variation obtained among conditions (Fig. 4C). Along PCO1, three groups were clearly separated, conditions without Cd on the positive side (open symbols), conditions with Cd and without VOCs (black closed symbols) or with Cd and nonanol (closed circles) next to the origin or on the less negative side of the axis, and conditions with Cd and nonanal (closed triangles) on the far negative side of axis 1. PCO2, explained 9.3% of total variation. Most conditions with nonanal (triangles) with or without Cd are on the positive side of the axis, and most conditions with nonanol (circles) are on the negative side of axis 2. From PCO analysis it was possible to observe that most biochemical markers were strongly correlated with PCO1 and with Cd conditions, especially when nonanal was also applied, evidencing that cells exposed to the combination of Cd and nonanal triggered a higher antioxidant response, but also inflicted more damage both in membranes (LPO) and proteins (PC) (Fig. 4C)."
12,Discussion,"The results obtained in this study show that aldehydes and alcohols affect the growth and metabolism of Rhizobium cells on the other side of the plate, showing that these compounds were able to occupy the entire atmosphere of divided petri dishes and proving evidence that aldehydes and alcohols synthesized by a bacterial cell can influence bacterial cells at least several centimeters apart. Indeed, Repetto et al. (2012) reported aldehydes as highly stable compounds that diffuse and attack targets far from the site of origin. Despite the similar chemical nature, the four aldehydes and the four alcohols studied caused different effects on Rhizobium cells either in the absence and presence of Cd, allowing to infer about the toxicity of these compounds and if the transformation of aldehydes to the corresponding alcohols constitute a mechanism of toxicity mitigation in cells."
13,Absence of Cd,"4.1 Absence of Cd In the absence of Cd two alcohols (octanol and nonanol) and one aldehyde (nonanal) caused membrane damage as shown by LPO values, evidencing that alcohols had higher impact in membrane stability. McKarns et al. (1997) described alcohols to alter the integrity of biological membranes. Andersen and Ingo (2011) reported that alcohols interact with lipid bilayers and present a chain-length-dependent lipid bilayer-alcohol interaction (Andersen and Ingo, 2011), which is in agreement with our results since hexanol decreased, heptanol did not change and octanol and nonanol increased LPO. Interference with the electron transport chain (ETC) functioning can increase the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Sharma et al., 2012). Interference may arise, among other factors, due to the destabilization of membranes (Blokhina and Fagerstedt, 2010), evidencing the potential of some aldehydes and alcohols to increase ROS. When interacting with membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) ROS originate lipid peroxides whose metabolism additionally produces aldehydes and alcohols (Cardoso et al., 2017; Pizzimenti et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2015; Korpi et al., 2009), both saturated and unsaturated (Lopachin and Gavin, 2014). When aldehydes and alcohols reach the cytosol, they are free to interact with intracellular molecules such as proteins. Alcohols can interfere with proteins function through direct interactions (Dopico and Lovinger, 2009) and sensitivity of proteins to alcohols was assigned to specific protein regions (Andersen and Ingo, 2011). Saturated aldehydes tend to react with lysine residues (Lys) in proteins (Lopachin and Gavin, 2014). Since many enzymes possess Lys residues involved in the catalysis and the activity of many others is regulated by post-translational modifications of Lys residues (Wu et al., 2015) the impact of aldehydes on cell metabolism is expected to be high (Ishino et al., 2008; Forterre et al., 2007; Ishikita, 2010; Ziegler et al., 2007; Fischer et al., 2011; Sekine et al., 2000; Stephen et al., 2018). Results from our study show that proteins were more susceptible to aldehydes than to alcohols. Indeed, protein carbonylation (PC) increased in cells exposed to some concentrations of the aldehydes tested. Alcohols induced less damage to proteins and in some conditions PC even decreased. Hexanal, heptanal and octanal had little influence on cell metabolism (protein levels) and antioxidant and biotransformation activities were not triggered, yet nonanal strongly impacted cytosol, increasing protein damage, reducing protein levels and triggering SOD and GSTs activity. On the other hand, the four alcohols tested did not induce negative effects or even protected proteins (lower PC in some heptanol and nonanol concentrations), and the antioxidant and biotransformation activities (SOD, CAT and GPx) were maintained or reduced, evidencing the protective effect of these alcohols towards cytosol. However, octanol and nonanol induced membrane damage. The lower energy investment in cytosolic antioxidant activity and repair, may have left more resources for growth. In fact, results show increased growth of cells exposed to alcohols relatively to control condition and to most concentrations of the corresponding aldehyde. This effect is especially evident when comparing nonanol with nonanal, with the alcohol having a positive and the aldehyde a negative effect on growth compared to control. The reduction of aldehydes to alcohols as a mechanism to reduce aldehydes toxicity was already described in eukaryotes (Pizzimenti et al., 2013) and suggested for prokaryotes (Cardoso et al., 2017). The present study evidenced that reduction of aldehydes to alcohols may act as an effective mechanism to restrain aldehydes toxicity in bacterial cells such as Rhizobium. However, results of the present study also show that the degree of protection depends on the pair aldehyde-respective alcohol considered (Fig. 5 )."
14,Presence of Cd,"4.2 Presence of Cd It is well known that Cd is toxic to Rhizobium cells, causing damage to membranes, proteins and activating antioxidant and biotransformation mechanisms to combat the oxidative stress generated by Cd. Since Cd effects on Rhizobium were already object of discussion in other studies (Nunes et al., 2018; Figueira et al., 2005; Corticeiro et al., 2013; Cardoso et al., 2018), the significant increase induced by Cd in all the parameters determined in the present study was not discussed. However, the effects of simultaneous exposure of Cd and aldehydes or alcohols to bacteria are virtually unknown and therefore the effects of combined exposure to these compounds and Cd were compared with sole exposure to Cd and differences thoroughly discussed in order to assess the influence of aldehydes and alcohols on Cd toxicity. Most aldehydes exacerbated (especially at higher concentrations) the damage inflicted by Cd in membranes and proteins. Little influence of aldehydes on antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes activity, (except for nonanal) was noted, possibly due to the increase of proteins. A rise in the copy number of enzymes, especially those sensitive to Cd stress, may compensate for the decrease in activity (Santos et al., 2016) that some enzymes may experience due to native conformation alterations. The alcohols hexanol, octanol and nonanol did not influence or even protected (hexanol) membranes from Cd damage. In cytosol, alcohols decreased protein damage caused by Cd, protein level and antioxidant and biotransformation activities, evidencing the protective role of alcohols in Cd exposed cells. The maintenance of GSTs activity, which convert toxic compounds resulting from peroxydized polyunsaturated fatty acids (Schmidt et al., 2015; El-Aal, 2012), which interact with proteins, into less reactive compounds (Regoli and Giuliani, 2014), may have protected proteins from oxidation and may explain the decrease in protein damage observed even when LPO was not reduced (octanol and nonanol). On the contrary, heptanol potentiated Cd toxicity, both in membranes and proteins. Although the activity of the three enzymes increased, the induction of antioxidant and biotransformation mechanisms was not enough to restrain damage. The present study also evidenced the higher toxicity of most aldehydes relatively to the corresponding alcohol in the presence of Cd, suggesting that reduction of aldehydes into alcohols may be an effective mechanism to restrain aldehydes toxicity in Rhizobium cells under Cd toxicity. Nonetheless, the protective effect was once again dependent on the pair aldehyde-respective alcohol considered and it differed from non-stressed cells (Fig. 6 )."
15,Relevance of the results,"4.3 Relevance of the results Overall the results obtained in this study pointed the relevance that reduction of saturated aldehydes into alcohols may have in the tolerance of cells to oxidative stress inducing agents like Cd. Differences in the ability to convert aldehydes to alcohols may emerge as a new feature explaining, at least in part, tolerance variability among bacteria and possibly other taxa. Further work is needed to clarify the relevance of reduction of aldehydes to alcohols in the tolerance of organisms to oxidative stress conditions. Increase in the activity of the enzymes (overexpression, activation) involved in the conversion of aldehydes to alcohols may be regarded as a tool to increase the tolerance of bacteria in environments impacted with metals or other pro-oxidants such as agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, nanomaterials, nanoplastics and other emerging contaminants. To make possible the development of this tool, more effort should be made to elucidate the traits regulating the activity of these enzymes. On the other hand, the suppression (subexpression, inhibition) of these enzymes’ activity may sensitize bacteria to antimicrobials, reduce resistance to antibiotics and be regarded as a new strategy to control multi-drug resistant pathogenic bacteria."
