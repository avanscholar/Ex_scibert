0,Introduction,"With the worsening environment and the depleting fossil energy such as oil and coal, the development of a sustainable and new energy has become more and more urgent [1,2]. Hydrogen, a sustainable, secure and environmentally benign energy, is recognized as the most promising alternative for fossil fuel. In many production processes of hydrogen energy, the electrochemical reduction of water to molecular hydrogen via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) provides an expected method [3–5]. However, the water electrolysis process requires high energy consumption to overcome the energy barrier, which hinders the large-scale application of water electrolysis technology to produce hydrogen. From the volcano relation diagram for pure metals [6], the precious metals Pt and Pd have particularly high catalytic activity [7,8]. In fact, the high cost and poor stability limit the wide application of this catalyst. It is necessary to develop inexpensive and effective HER catalysts. Nickel is a more active non-noble metal, and has the advantages of good stability and low cost, and is widely regarded as an excellent electrocatalyst material. Recently, many scholars have devoted themselves to studying nickel-based electrodes as cathode materials for water splitting. As a substitute for hydrogen evolution reaction, metallic nickel still has a big gap with precious metals. Researchers have proposed many measures to optimize nickel-based catalysts, including heteroatom doping [9–12], defect engineering [13–15] for accelerating the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of bimetals can adjust the electron density of catalysts, many studies have been executed that doping the second metal into the Ni-based to improve the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode material. For example, Ni-Cu [16], Ni-Mo [17], Ni-Au [18], Ni-Pt [19], Ni-Fe [20], Ni-Se [21], Ni-Co [22] and so on. All of the above catalysts exhibited better HER performance than pure Ni in an alkaline solution. Among them, Ni-Co alloy has been widely studied as an effective HER electrocatalyst because of its improved intrinsic catalytic activity and enhanced corrosion resistance with respect to pure Ni under alkaline conditions. The content of Co had a significant effect on the catalytic performance of nickel-based catalysts [23,24]. For example, nickel-based catalysts doped with cobalt atoms were used for carbon monoxide methanation, when the atomic ratio of nickel -cobalt was 6:4, which had the most catalytic performance [25]. The nickel-based catalyst for the conversion of carbon monoxide and lower alcohol varied with the content of cobalt atoms incorporated. When the atomic ratio was 5:3, the conversion rate was the highest [26]. By adjusting the molar ratio of nickel salt and cobalt salt in the precursor, when the molar ratio of Co/(Co + Ni) was 0.85, hydrogen production had the best performance in the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride [27]. In summary, studying the effect of the atomic ratio of nickel and cobalt in the nickel-based catalyst on HER through experiments and theoretical calculation systems had important reference value for the design and preparation of HER catalysts. Furthermore, the development of catalysts with micro/nanostructures has also become an effective measure to improve electrocatalytic activity. By increasing the specific surface area, abundant active sites are generated, which facilitates the bridge between the reactant and the catalyst. In particular, the one-dimensional nano-array structure shows great advantages [28–31]. This configuration allows electrons to be transferred from the current collector to the reaction site through each individual nanowire to effectively use all the nanowires. The synthesis of nanoarray structure on a conductive substrate can be accomplished by a variety of methods, such as hydrothermal/solvothermal and vapor deposition [32–35]. In this work, we adopted a novel in-situ growth method for nanowire arrays. Ordered porous template-assisted electrochemical deposition was a convenient method to prepare nanowire arrays, which have the advantages of well-controlled geometry, not easy to agglomerate, and strong adhesion to current collectors. The method of adhering the catalyst and the substrate through adhesives will affect the conductivity of the electrode. Therefore, a highly ordered and firmly adhered nickel-cobalt nanowire arrays (Ni-Co NWAs) obtained by direct electrodeposition on a titanium substrate and AAO template-assisted method was used, which can be directly used for HER test. Different proportions of cobalt atoms were doped into Ni NWAs to distinguish HER performance. A systematic DFT calculation was carried out to explore the influence of the atomic ratio of nickel to cobalt on the performance of HER to ensure that the experimental results were more reliable."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Ni and Ni-Co NWAs,"2.1 Preparation of Ni and Ni-Co NWAs The AAO templates were prepared by a modified two-step anodic oxidation method [36]. Fabrication of the nanowire arrays was performed by electrodeposition in a three-electrode system at room temperature. Saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and platinum sheet (2 cm × 2 cm × 0.01 cm) were used as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. And the work electrode was assembled through the order of titanium sheets, the through-hole AAO template, a nickel foam and fixed with clip. The electrolyte was made by dissolving NiSO4 6H2O 20 g, NaCl 1 g, and H3BO3 3 g in 100 mL deionized water. The deposition executed by electrochemical workstation at a constant potential of −1.2 V for 600 s. Similarly, a series of Ni-Co nanowire arrays with different Ni-Co atomic ratios (Ni:Co = 3:1;11:1;32:1) were obtained by adding CoSO4 7H2O to the electrolyte, and were recorded NC3, NC11 and NC32. Subsequently, the obtained nanowire arrays were removed AAO template in NaOH solution (5 wt%) for 2 h, and then rinse the sample with ethanol and deionized water for further characterization."
3,Characterization,2.2 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected with a RigakuD/MAX 2500/PC with Cu Ka radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a 5°/min scan rate. Sample morphologies were characterized using a Zeiss Supra 55 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical tests were executed in a three-electrode system at room temperature by using electrochemical workstation (Shanghai ChenHua CHI660E). The platinum sheet (10 mm × 10 mm×0.1 mm) and the Hg/HgO electrode were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. And the nanowire arrays deposited on the Ti substrate was used directly as a working electrode without further processing. Before the electrochemical test, the working electrode was activated in a 1 M KOH using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) with the range of −0.4−0 V (vs.Hg/HgO) at a sweep speed of 100mV s−1. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was tested at a rate of 5 mV s−1 in a range of 0∼−1.8 V (vs. Hg/HgO). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out at the overpotential of 200 mV versus RHE with a frequency range of 0.1∼100,000 Hz. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was proportional to Cdl (double layer capacitor), and Cdl was estimated by using the CV measurements with different scan rates from 100 to 500 mV s−1 from −0.825∼−0.725 V vs. Hg/HgO. The stability tests were performed at different potential for total of 80h. CV was carried out from −0.9 V to −1.35 V (vs. Hg/HgO) at a rate of 50 mV s−1 for 2500 cycles in order to test the durability of the catalyst. Reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale was calculated by Eq. (1): (1) ERHE = EHg/HgO+ 0.05916pH + EΘ Hg/HgO"
5,DFT calculation,"2.4 DFT calculation All first-principles calculations involved in this study were conducted using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [37,38] and projector-augmented plane-wave method (PAW) [39,40] within the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) parametrization scheme for the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Full structural optimization was performed in which all lattice parameters and internal atomic positions were relaxed until the Hellmann-Feynman forces acting on each atom were less than 0.01 eV/Å. For both structural and static electronic structure calculations, a plane-wave energy cut off of 400 eV was used for the GGA approach."
6,Results and discussion,"The morphology and composition of the prepared Ni-Co NWAs were characterized by SEM and EDS. Fig. 1 showed nanowire arrays with different Ni-Co atomic ratios which can be seen that large-scale nanowires were obtained and the diameter of the nanowires were uniform (∼ 100 nm). As the content of Co atoms changed, the morphology of nanowire arrays was not significantly changed due to the restricted area effect of the AAO template. The side view (Fig. 2 ) showed that the length of the Ni-Co nanowire arrays was similar (∼ 15 μm), and the array structure was maintained. One-dimensional nanowire arrays grown directly on the current collector are promising due to their large aspect ratio and inability to aggregate [36]. In the theoretical calculation model, the number of 32 nickel atoms were used as a basic unit cell, so the minimum ratio of nickel-cobalt bimetallic catalyst was set to 32:1. The inset of Fig. 1 quantified the atomic ratio of nickel-cobalt. The EDS results indicated that the nickel-cobalt atomic ratios of NC3, NC11 and NC32 were about 2:1, 5:1, and 25:1, respectively, which were higher than the composition of the initial metal electrolyte, and the higher Co content was attributed to heterogeneous deposition. From Fig. 3 , the EDS mapping images of NC32 showed the uniform distribution of Ni and Co elements throughout the nanowire arrays, confirming the formation of a uniform alloy nanowire. The crystal structure of bimetallic Ni-Co and pure Ni NWAs were studied by XRD technology. As shown in Fig. 4 , in addition to the diffraction peaks of the Ti substrate, the other three distinct XRD diffraction peaks, which were located at 44.50°, 51.84°, and 76.37°, corresponded to the face-centered cubic (111), (200), and (220) lattice planes, and the peak lay between the standard diffraction peaks of Co (JCPDS number 15-0806) and Ni (JCPDS number 04-0850), indicating that Ni-Co alloy was formed instead of a mixed metal crystal. Furthermore, comparing the peak positions of (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes in NC32 and pure Ni nanowires, a slight peak shift can be observed, as shown by the dotted line in Fig. 4. This phenomenon may be caused by the formation of FCC Ni-Co alloy in NC32, which causes lattice distortion [41]. It can be seen intuitively that the (220) lattice planes of Ni, NC3, NC11 and NC32 NWAs showed the trend of preferential growth which due to the limitation of the AAO template nanopores and the influence of deposition parameters [42]. Moreover, the crystallinity of the Ni-Co NWAs was relatively high, and the absence of obvious impurity peaks also indicated the high phase purity of the sample. A typical three-electrode system was assembled for testing the HER activity of nanowire arrays with different Ni-Co ratios in 1 M KOH electrolyte, with pure Ni NWAs as a comparison without any processing. Ni-Co NWAs grown in-situ on a Ti substrate can be directly tested as working electrodes. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) curve (normalized geometric surface area) after iR compensation showed that the role of the Ti substrate was almost negligible. For comparison, the LSV curve of NC32 with and without iR correction was shown in the Fig. 5b. In sharp contrast, the Ni-Co NWAs exhibited better HER performance. It was impressive that NC32 exhibited optimal performance, requiring overpotentials of 103,146, and 240 mV to drive current density of 10, 20, and 80mA cm−2, and lower than pure Ni nanowires (131,169 and 265 mV), NC3 (171,206 and 280 mV) and NC11 (127,167 and 252 mV) at the same current density. Compared with other Ni-Co-based catalysts as reported (as shown in Fig.6 ), NC32 NWAs exhibited better HER performance under alkaline conditions. At the same time, NC32 also showed lower Tafel slopes of 104mV dec−1 than Ni (134 mV dec−1), NC3 (120 mV dec−1) and NC11 (131 mV dec−1), as shown in Fig. 5c. A low Tafel slope means that catalysis has good reaction kinetics. The Tafel slope of all catalysts indicated that the Volmer-step was a speed-controlled step in the HER process (H2O + e− = Hads + OH−) [50]. In order to further analyze the charge transfer characteristics during the HER, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed, as shown in Fig. 5d. Nyquist plots showed that NC32 had a lower electrochemical impedance (Rct = 20Ω), which was lower than Ni (Rct = 25Ω) and NC3 (Rct = 38Ω). The inset of Fig. 5d was fitting of equivalent circuit models for different catalysts. These results showed that the doping amount of Co atoms had a significant impact on the HER. When the Co content was lower, Ni-Co NWA had a better synergistic advantage and can reduce the hydrogen release overpotential. The influence of the doping amount of Co atoms on the HER was consistent with the theoretical calculation results. The quantitative doping of Co atoms can enhance the charge transfer ability and the combination between electrons and adsorbed hydrogen, and can also achieve effective electrical integration to minimize parasitic ohmic losses [51]. The electric double layer capacitor (Cdl) was used to evaluate the electrochemical surface area (ECSA = Cdl / Cdlref, Cdlref is the theoretical electric double layer capacitance) of the prepared catalysts, so as to reflect the inherent catalytic performance of catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5e, the Cdl of NC32 was 10.67mF cm−2, which was significantly higher than NC3(3.65mF cm−2), NC11(7.24mF cm−2) and Ni(7.35mF cm−2). It is worth noting that under the conditions of similar morphological characteristics, the higher ESCA of NC32 may be attributed to the incorporation of low-content Co atoms and the better electronic synergy with Ni, which can provide active sites for hydrogen activation and adsorption for the HER process. Otherwise, to obtain intrinsically activity of catalyst, it was necessary to normalize catalytic activities by the active surface area [52–54], where the activity of NC32 was still higher than other catalysts, which proved that NC32 had a larger current density, as shown in Fig. 5f . The Cdl value that was proportional to ECSA can be used to exclude the contribution of ECSA and proved that NC32 catalyst had higher inherent activity than other catalysts. CV and real-time testing of the current density are two effective means to corroborate long-term durability of catalysis [55,56]. The durability of the NC32 NWAs was studied by measuring 80 h at low and large current densities. As can be seen from Fig. 5g, the current density of NC32 had no drastic decay at potential -0.18V, -0.23V and -0.25V (vs. RHE). After performing the 2500 CV examination, from the inset of Fig. 5g, the LSV curve was similar to the initial electrode which can be attributed to the structure of the nanowire arrays that prevented the catalyst from agglomerating during the HER process, which rose the hydrogen evolution efficiency. XRD was performed after the stability test, and it can be seen from Fig. 7 that no obvious oxide peak was found and the SEM test showed that the nanowire arrays still maintained the original morphology. The high HER performance of NC32 can be attributed to the following three aspects: (1) the structure of the nanowire arrays can increase the specific surface area and provide more active sites for the hydrogen adsorption/desorption reaction. (2) The electronic effect between the bimetals changes the electronic structure of the metal which changes the adsorption/desorption energy of the reactant on the metal. (3) The presence of low content of cobalt atoms has a strong interaction with nickel atoms, which enhances the synergistic effect between nickel and cobalt atoms. To gain further insight into the electrocatalytic activity of the Ni-Co NWAs, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by constructing the correlative theoretical models ( Fig. 8 ) to calculate the Gibbs free energy of H* adsorption (ΔGH*) on various sites of Ni-Co. The detailed calculation data was showed in Table 1 . The free energies were calculated by ΔG(H*) = ΔE(H*) + ΔZPE – TΔS, where TΔS was −0.205 eV and ΔZPE was −0.05 eV [42]. We calculated the hydrogen adsorption when a Co atom was doped on the surface of Ni(100), (110), (111). In the case of 1Co-doped Ni(110), when the hydrogen adsorption site was at the hollow position of Ni, the |ΔGH*| = 0.02 eV was found to be the closest to zero. As for 1Co-doped Ni(100) and 1Co-doped Ni(111), it was found that the top site and bridge site were the sites with the best hydrogen evolution activity respectively. According to our previous work [39], the active position with the best hydrogen evolution performance of pure nickel was the hollow site of Ni(110) surface and the |ΔGH*| = 0.06 eV. Comparing the hydrogen evolution performance of pure Ni and Co-doped with Ni, it can be clearly concluded from Fig. 9 that the model with one Co atom added significantly improved the hydrogen evolution performance. Except for the case of one Co atom doping, we also calculated the hydrogen evolution performance of two Co-doped Ni. Surprisingly, although the hydrogen evolution performance of 2Co-doped Ni(110) which the hydrogen adsorption on the hollow site when two cobalt were in the para-position was improved compared with pure Ni(110) hollow site, it was far inferior to the performance of 1Co-doped Ni(110) hollow site, which was in good agreement with the experimental results. Based on this result, we speculated that the increase in the proportion of cobalt may not be conductive to the improvement of hydrogen evolution performance. Theoretical calculation results were accordant with experimental results suggesting that a small amount of cobalt doping can strongly enhance the HER performance of Ni NWAs, whereas the HER performance of Ni-Co NWAs materials decreased unexpectedly with the proportion of cobalt increasing."
7,Conclusion,"The AAO template-assisted electrodeposition method was used to prepare Ni, NC3, NC11 and NC32 NWAs. The experimental results displayed that the HER performance of Ni-Co NWAs with lower cobalt atom content was better than that of Ni NWAs. NC32 required an overpotential of 103 mV drove a current density of 10mA cm−2. Conversely, when the content of cobalt atoms was higher, the HER performance of the catalyst was lower than that of Ni NWAs, and NC3 demanded an overpotential of 171 mV to achieve a current density of 10mA cm−2. Theoretical calculation results showed that the 1Co-doped Ni(110) had a lower Gibbs free energy (|ΔGH*| = 0.02 eV) compared with the 2Co-doped Ni(110)(|ΔGH*| = 0.05 eV) and pure Ni(|ΔGH*| = 0.06 eV) which strongly consistent with experimental results suggesting that a small amount of cobalt doping can improve the HER performance of Ni NWAs, but as the proportion of cobalt increases, the HER performance of Ni-Co NWAs materials decreases."
