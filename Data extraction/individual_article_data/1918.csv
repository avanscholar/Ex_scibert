0,Introduction,"Protection of the environment, especially by using greener technologies and substituting fossil fuels with lignocellulosic biomass to reduce greenhouse gasses emission, is one of the most active topics in the chemical research [1–3]. On the account of its availability and low price, considerable research efforts have been devoted to convert lignocellulosic biomass into fuel in the past years. High oxygen content lowers the heating value of liquid biomass, necessitating the oxygen removal to provide a competitive alternative fuel [4–7]. Nowadays, more and more effort is put into converting lignocellulosic biomass into the platform and added value chemicals, which can substitute their petroleum-based counterparts [8]. In recent years, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process has attracted increasing attention as a means of converting lignocellulosic biomass over either biocatalysts/enzymes or heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts at suitable reaction conditions [9]. Insight into the transformation mechanism is crucial for a successful and selective conversion of biomass. To obtain detailed understanding of biomass HDO, several investigations were carried out on aliphatic model compounds with the same functional groups as are present in biomass-derived compounds, such as carboxylic acids, esters, ethers, alcohols and aldehydes. Different reaction conditions were studied, varying temperature, pressure, solvent, atmosphere as well as catalysts, focusing especially on commercially widely used NiMo and CoMo on alumina. Extensive research work has been done by Senol et al., who systematically investigated the HDO of several aliphatic oxygenates over sulphided NiMo or CoMo catalyst [10–14]. One of the selected model compounds was 1-heptanol, where high conversion with high heptane selectivity was reached in a batch reactor at 250 °C and under H2 pressure of 7.5 MPa. Heptene isomers and diheptyl ether were detected as intermediates. Li and Huber investigated the HDO of 1-butanol and 2-butanol in aqueous solution at 245 °C with 2.9 MPa H2 over Pt/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst [15]. Higher conversion was reached with 2-butanol than 1-butanol at same reaction conditions and reaction time, which was explained with the higher reactivity of the secondary alcohol, due to higher stability of secondary carbocation compared to the primary carbocation. Aldehyde hydrodeoxygenation has shown heavy products formation due to aldol condensation over sulphided NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in a comprehensive research presented by Wang et al. [16]. Selectivity to alcohol was found to be higher at higher catalyst sulphidation pretreatment temperature as well as at higher experimental reaction temperatures. Heavy products formation is promoted by the OH groups on alumina support, since during sulphidation the MoS2 slabs are formed on the alumina surface, which promote the alcohol formation [17]. Moreover, it has been shown that the presence of water also improves alcohol selectivity during aldehyde hydrogenation [18]. Microkinetic models have already been developed for several reactions, notably for a well-known water-gas shift reaction, while HDO reaction mechanisms for biomass based model compounds are still quite unexplored. A hydrodeoxygenation study of methyl heptanoate over Rh/ZrO2 reported by Bie et al. presents a simplified kinetic scheme network for kinetic modeling, where a consecutive hydrogenation of heptanoic acid to heptanol through heptanal formation was lumped in one step, being explained with difficult detection of aldehyde due to its high reactivity [19]. Recently, Jeništova et al. published kinetic modeling of the HDO of stearic acid through representative alcohol and aldehyde formation to saturated alkanes over the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst [20]. The rate equations were described with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of kinetics, where the noncompetitive adsorption of hydrogen and compounds was assumed. A mechanistic study of 1-octanol HDO over γ-Al2O3, SiO2 and HZSM-5 supported catalysts was presented by Palla et al., where C7 hydrocarbons were observed as the primary products over γ-Al2O3 and SiO2 catalysts, while C8 hydrocarbons were detected as the primary products over HZSM-5 supported catalysts [21]. An extensive reaction scheme was developed for HDO of 1-octanol. Besides microkinetic modeling, density functional theory (DFT) atomistic calculations are becoming one of the most useful tools in explaining chemical transformations and underpinning microkinetic models. A few publications made use of DFT calculations to evaluate adsorption, HDO pathways and to obtain reaction rate parameters for elementary reaction steps. Behtash et al. presented a theoretical investigation of the methyl propionate HDO over Pd catalyst, where equilibrium, forward rate constants and calculated net rate for the elementary steps were presented based on DFT calculations [22]. Moreover, a detailed mechanistic study of propanal on the Ni-promoted and the non-promoted MoS2 active phase based on DFT calculations was performed, revealing propanol and propanethiol as intermediates and propane as the final product [23]. Lu et al. developed a microkinetic model of propanoic acid HDO over Pd(111) catalyst based on parameters obtained from first principles [24] and concluded that decarboxylation and decarbonylation are the dominant reaction mechanisms. The objective of this work is to carry out detailed kinetic modeling for the HDO reaction pathway of the desired model compounds, containing terminal functional groups over commercial NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Oxygenated functional groups on the hexane backbone were selected to represent functionalized hexoses from depolymerized cellulose and hemicellulose, while their gradual hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and decarboxylation into saturated hydrocarbons were studied. The present study comprises a detailed investigation of the temperature influence on kinetic parameters during HDO of selected model compounds. For this purpose, experiments with 1-hexanol, hexanoic acid, hexanal, methyl hexanoate and dihexyl ether were performed in the presence or absence of a solid catalyst at 5 MPa of hydrogen pressure at various temperatures. Catalyst was characterized in detail to obtain the crucial information for the model, specifically; surface area, pore volume, pore size and concentration of active sites; obtained results are presented in our previous work [25]. Activation energies for crucial steps were also calculated by DFT calculations, especially for terminal alcohol hydrotreatment which was compared to secondary alcohols hydrotreatment from our previous study [26]. Furthermore, the mathematically modelled values were fitted to experimental data in order to obtain kinetic and mass transfer parameters."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst characterization,"2.1 Catalyst characterization All reactions were performed using commercial bifunctional NiMo/γ-Al2O3 sulphided catalyst. The catalyst in its sulphided form was selected to be used in this study as it was found to be by far most active compared to the oxide and reduced (metal) forms in the catalyst screening study, where liquefied biomass was hydrodeoxygenated, and since this form is most commonly used for hydrotreatment in petro-industry [27]. The characterization methods (SEM, EDX, XRD) used for structural characterization of the catalyst, which had been milled and sieved to gather particles with diameter under 100 µm, have been reported in our previous work [25]. Specific surface area was determined by BET using ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) instrument and concentration of active sites was measured by TPR analysis (AutoChem II Chemisorption Analyzer). CHNS elemental analysis was performed by Elementar MICRO cube analyser. Detailed characterization methodology and results of the same catalyst can be found in our previous studies [25,27,28]."
3,Hydrodeoxygenation process,"2.2 Hydrodeoxygenation process A cylindrical batch stainless steel autoclave (300 mL, the inner diameter of 43 mm and the height of 210 mm, Parker Autoclave Engineers) was used for catalytic hydrotreatment experiments with model compounds. Magnetically driven Rushton turbine impeller (with diameter of 30 mm and located 25 mm above reactor bottom) provided sufficient agitation of the reaction mixture. The total volume of reaction mixture was in each experiment 120 mL, containing 90 wt% of solvent (hexadecane, ≥ 99 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich), 10 wt% of a model compound and 25 wt% of the catalyst with respect to the mass of model compound. Model compounds, used in presented experiments, were: 1-hexanol, hexanal, hexanoic acid, methyl hexanoate and dihexyl ether, all provided by Sigma-Aldrich (with purity ≥ 99 wt%). Prior to use the sulphided NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst had been milled and sieved to obtain particles with a diameter under 100 µm. Reactor was filled with a reaction mixture, attached to the housing, sealed and equipped with a heating belt. The whole system was purged with nitrogen (5.0, Messer, Bad Soden am Taunus, Germany) to ensure an inert atmosphere. Furthermore, the system was purged and subsequently pressurized with hydrogen (5.0, Messer, Bad Soden am Taunus, Germany) to ensure a reduction atmosphere. Experiments were performed in a closed reactor in a batch regime with agitation speed of 1000 min−1. All experiments were started at room temperature and heated-up with a heating rate 7.5 K min−1 up to the desired final temperature by using a PID-regulated electric jacket heater (see Table 1 ). Upon reaching temperature plateau, the temperature was held constant for 60–120 min, depending on the model compound used, followed by a rapid reaction mixture cool-down to the room temperature. The gas phase was released and purged with inert gas (N2) before opening."
4,"Analysis of reactants, intermediates and products","2.3 Analysis of reactants, intermediates and products Gaseous and liquid phases were analyzed by using various analytic methods. Gaseous phase was sampled in 25 min intervals, cooled-down in a vertical condenser for 2 min and subsequently analyzed by the GC (gas chromatograph, 8610-C, SRI Instruments, CA, USA; equipped with TCD, FID methanizer-FID and FPD detectors) and FTIR (Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy, Spectrum 100, Perkin Elmer). Gaseous samples were withdrawn at pressure above 5 MPa, therefore the sample volume of 3 mL was sufficient to thoroughly flush the GC sampling loop and FTIR short path gas cell with KBr windows. FTIR analysis range was between 450 and 4000 cm−1. The spectrum of pure hydrogen was recorded as a background and subtracted from gaseous spectra of the gas phase recorded during the experiment. Liquid phase was analyzed by Thermo Scientific gas chromatograph (Focus GC, Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) equipped with a capillary column ZB-5MS (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) and a flame ionization detector. Separate liquid samples were taken from the reaction mixture at approximately 15 min intervals during the reaction, filtered, diluted in heptane and analyzed offline. In the temperature-programed method the initial oven temperature was kept at 313 K for 7.2 min, and then increased to 383 K by a heat-up rate of 25 K min−1. Afterwards the temperature was increased to 498 K by a heat-up rate of 18 K min−1, followed by the final column conditioning at 553 K. Temperature of injector and detector was held at 568 K, injection volume was 1 µL and split ratio was 50. For identification of unknown compounds GC–MS (Ultra 2010, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used with ˃97% agreement to mass spectrum and retention index matching with standards from NIST 14 and FFNSC 2 libraries. Components in the liquid phase were quantified according to the 7-point calibration curves, prepared for all quantified components using external standards. All standards were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich."
5,Hydrodeoxygenation microkinetic mathematical model,"2.4 Hydrodeoxygenation microkinetic mathematical model Hydrotreatment of oxygen-containing model compounds over solid catalyst with gaseous hydrogen takes place in a three-phase reactor/contactor and the overall conversion rates of the reactions involved can be influenced by the mass transfer from gaseous to the liquid phase, from liquid phase to the catalyst surface, adsorption and desorption rates and reactions on the catalyst surface or in a bulk liquid. Based on detected intermediates and products during gaseous and liquid sample analysis, a deterministic microkinetic model was developed accounting each individual step to determine their contribution to the global rates of oxygen moieties conversion. A detailed description of a microkinetic model development was already presented in the previous work [26]. Nevertheless, the mass transfer rates from gas to liquid phase ( r n GL ) and from liquid phase to the catalyst surface ( r n LS ) and molar balances in each phase for compounds (n) are presented below to preserve a better overview on the developed mechanistic microkinetic model. (1) r n GL = k n g · a g · p n He - c n l (2) r n LS = k n l · a s · ( c n l - c n s ) Temperature dependent density and viscosity [29] of hexadecane were calculated from literature and considered in calculations of transport phenomena, such as Henry’s constant (He), characteristic stirrer speed ( N * ), gas bubble diameter ( d b ), surface tension of liquid ( σ 1 ), gas–liquid transfer coefficient ( k n g ), Schmidt number ( Sc ), diffusion coefficient ( D AB ), molar volume of a solvent (VD ), gas hold-up ( ε g ), interface area between the gaseous and liquid phase ( a g ) and liquid–solid mass transfer coefficient ( k n l ) [30,31]. Specific interface area between the liquid and solid phase ( a s ) was determined by N2 physisorption, p n presents partial pressure of a compound (n). Correlations, equations, nomenclature and units are the same as in our previous work [26] and can be found in the Supplementary data (Table SD1) with the respective references. Competitive adsorption and desorption rates were calculated transiently without pre-considering any rate-limiting step and were defined as follows: (3) r n ads = k n ads · c n s · c as (4) r n des = k n des · c n ads The adsorption and desorption rate constants ( k n ads and k n des ) were not considered temperature dependent within the narrow temperature window of experimental conditions varied and their values were adopted from our previous work on deoxygenation of non-terminal oxygen moieties. In the mathematical model a dissociative hydrogen adsorption was considered on catalyst surface, which is corroborated by DFT calculations. Kinetic rates ( r i cat ) of catalytic surface reactions depend on concentration of adsorbed reactant (Eq. (5)). Eq. (6) is used in case of H2 being a co-reactant. Kinetic rate constants ( k i cat ) for a reaction i were considered temperature dependent according to the Arrhenius law and were calculated for each modelled time increment. 25 activation energies, 37 characteristic reaction rate constants and two pairs of adsorption and desorption rate constants were determined by the regression analysis, based on experimental data (more than 5000 experimental points in total). (5) r i cat ( t ) = k i cat ( T final ) · exp - E a i R · 1 T ( t ) - 1 T final · c n ads ( t ) (6) r i cat ( t ) = k i cat ( T final ) · exp - E a i R · 1 T ( t ) - 1 T final · c n ads ( t ) · c H 2 ads ( t ) Beside chemical transformations on the catalyst surface, which were dominant, also contributions of homogeneous transformation in the bulk liquid were included. (7) r i hom = k i hom · c n l (8) r i hom = k i hom · c n l · c H 2 l Concentrations of detected compound were experimentally determined by GC analysis, while the modelled values were calculated after solving a set of differential equations describing the molar balances for all compounds. Molar balances for hydrogen and gaseous product in gas phase, as well as all reactants, intermediates and products in liquid phase, on solid-liquid interface and on the catalyst surface were taken into account. All compounds, including H2, reactants and intermediates in all phases are presented as index n. (9) d n n g dt = - r n GL · V l (10) d c n l dt = r n GL - r n LS ± ∑ r i hom (11) V s d c n s dt = r n LS · V l - r n ads · V l + r n des · V l The compound concentration on the solid–liquid interphase could be written with the algebraic equation, since the thickness of a convective volume is insignificant ( V s → 0). (12) c n s = k n des · c n ads · V l + k n l · c n l · a s · V l k n l · a s · V l + k n ads · c as · V l Initial concentrations of intermediates and products in gaseous and liquid phase and on the catalyst surface were set to zero, except of the initial concentration of the model compound in each experiment. Hydrogen was set to be initially present only in gaseous phase, with its concentration in liquid and on solid surface was set to zero. Initial concentration of catalyst’s vacant active sites was set according to the mass of a catalyst, reaction mixture volume and concentration of NiMoSx surface concentration estimated in our previous work [25]. The developed mathematical model was used to solve a set of differential equations in Matlab R2015b with ODE 23tb solver based on the implicit Runge–Kutta formula. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters such as the rate constants at the relevant temperatures (k i) and the activation energies (E ai) for each reaction were refined with the least square approximation method based on the Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm. The measured concentrations were fitted to the modelled values for all experiments simultaneously (global fitting) to obtain kinetic parameters relevant for reactions involved in hydrotreatment of oxygen-containing moieties on a terminal position of the hexane chain. DFT calculations (vide infra) were performed to obtain additional insights into reaction mechanisms and to be able to compare reactivity of secondary C6 alcohols [26] with that of primary alcohol. Additionally, aldehyde and ketone activity was contrasted."
6,DFT calculations,"2.5 DFT calculations For DFT calculations, open-source Quantum Espresso 5.4 program was employed. We mostly follow the same methodology as in our previous work [26]. In short, to describe valence electrons, ultrasoft pseudopotentials in a generalized gradient approximation of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional were used. Due to rather large supercell, Brillouin zone was described with a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh. Kinetic energy cutoff of 340 eV and electron density cutoff of 2000 eV were sufficient. Dispersion interactions were introduced by Grimme method (DFT-D2). Adsorption energies were obtained from (13) Δ E ads = E cat + ads - E cat - E ads where E cat+ads represents total energy of the catalyst with adsorbed species, E cat stands for bare catalyst and E ads for isolated adsorbate species. Transition states were located with climbing image nudge elastic band and refined with force convergence criterion 0.05 eV/Å. Stable structures (initial and final states) were refined until 0.01 eV/Å. Activation barriers were calculated as (14) E a = E TS - E initial and reaction energy as (15) Δ E = E final - E initial Catalyst was modelled in a unit cell of four MoS2 units in lateral direction and depth of three Mo layers. To take Ni promoter effect into account, two surface Mo atoms have been substituted with Ni. Bottom two layers were frozen in bulk positions. Above top-layer Mo atoms, a sulphur bridge atom is placed when investigating hydrogenation reactions. For more details refer to [26]. For quantum calculations regarding equilibria and homogeneous (uncatalysed) reactions, Gaussian 09 was used. Molecules were treated at B3LYP density functional level with 6-311 + G(3df,2p) basis set. Solvent effects were included through polarizable continuum model. Transition states were located with synchronous transit-guided quasi-Newton method (STQN) and subjected to vibrational analysis. More details can be found in our previous work [26]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Commercially available NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, presulphided by a Totsucat® process was characterized in detail in terms of morphology, metal loading, concentration and type of active sites, as presented in our previous works [27,28]. Determination and calculation of active sites and pore size distribution was presented in our recent study of levulinic acid HDO [25]. The most relevant catalyst characteristics are presented in Table 2 . The active phases responsible for the HDO were assumed to originate from α-NiMoO4 and β-NiMoO4 precursors, which are converted into NiMoSx phases during the sulphidation. The surface concentration of (NiMoSx) the active sites was determined (by consecutive H2-TPR, O2-TPO and H2-TPR experiments) to be 0.33 μmol m−2 in our previous works [25,26], assuming that it remains unchanged after the complete sulphidation by the Totsucat® process and few months’ storage under inert atmosphere. A fresh catalyst had been completely pre-sulphided, as confirmed by elemental analysis (CHNS). Its sulphur content was 5.98 ± 0.04 wt%, which corresponds to the amount required for a complete sulphidation of all available Ni and Mo. After the reaction, the catalyst retained the initial sulphur content. At most 6 ppb of H2S was detected in the reactor headspace (during Experiment 7, i.e. with hexanoic acid at 275 °C). In the used catalyst, the sulphur content was still 5.90 ± 0.07 wt%. It can be concluded that the NiMo sites are completely sulphided and the sulphur leaching and consequent diminishing of the active sites by reduction of sulphides can be considered negligible within the time-span of the experiments in this work. Although Wagenhofer et al. demonstrated that various Ni- and Mo- sulphide sites catalyze the deoxygenation reactions differently [32], all sites were considered to be equally active in this work and their activity did not change over time, due to insignificant leaching. All the reaction rate constants are to be related to the surface sites density of the most probable precursor (NiMoO4) of the active phase, their number is considered to remain unchanged after a complete sulphidation to NiMoSx, and is proportionate to the concentration of sites that are actually active (most often located at the edges of the sulphides). For theoretical results to be comparable with our previous work on secondary alcohols and ketones [26], the catalyst was modelled in the same fashion. DFT calculations had revealed that hydrogen dissociation upon binding to Ni and S atoms. Other species (O- and C-bound) bind to Mo atoms, as well. Thus, the catalyst is modelled as an M-edge of Ni-doped MoS2. As shown in Fig. 1 , the active site is the interface of Mo-S-Mo/Ni-Mo. When studying deoxygenation reactions, a vacant site is required. This is achieved by removing the sulphur bridge atom. The reader is referred to reference [26] for more details and model justification."
9,Reaction pathway network development,"3.2 Reaction pathway network development A reaction pathway network presented in Fig. 2 has been proposed based on comprehensive analysis of liquid and gaseous samples. Intermediates detected in the liquid samples collected during the experiment contained oxygen functional groups, while the final products consist of hydrocarbons, i.e. pentane and hexane. In the gaseous phase CO, CO2 and methane were detected by FTIR and GC analyses, while their overall amount was significantly lower compared to the initial amount of reactant (in moles). During experiments of methyl hexanoate HDO, the methyl group was cleaved to ultimately yield hexanoic acid. In parallel, hexanal formation was also noticed, being explained as dehydration and subsequent hydrogenation of the carboxyl group. Moreover, aldehyde can be formed directly from methyl hexanoate by methanol elimination but is subsequently hydrogenated to hexanol. At this point, formation of pentane was also observed due to decarboxylation and decarbonylation of hexanoic acid and hexanal, respectively. Decarboxylation and decarbonylation were proved by detection of CO2 and CO in gaseous phase. Thereupon hexanol was formed and its esterification with hexanoic acid was also detected and included in the reaction pathway network. In the presence of water, hydrolysis of hexyl hexanoate yields hexanoic acid and hexanol. Due to negligible concentration of water in reaction mixture the transformation into hexanoic acid and hexene is more likely to take place. The same transformation was proposed by Hachemi et al. [33]. Dehydration of primary alcohol leads to formation of ether, olefins or alkane, i.e. dihexyl ether, hexene isomers and hexane, respectively. HDO of hexanoic acid followed a similar reaction pathway as methyl hexanoate. In the first step, formation of hexanal was observed in trace concentrations, caused by a rapid hydrogenation to hexanol. Since hexanol was formed, esterification between hexanol and residual hexanoic acid took place. In addition, decarboxylation and decarbonylation of hexanoic acid and hexanal occurred, as evidenced by detection of CO and CO2 in the gaseous phase and pentane in the liquid phase. Pentene intermediate, proposed by Senol [10], was not detected in our case. Three different HDO reaction pathways of 1-hexanol to hexane were considered, specifically; a direct dehydration/hydrogenation to hexane (substitution of OH groups with H), dehydration to 1-hexene with subsequent isomerization and final hydrogenation to hexane, and a condensation reaction resulting in ether formation and its subsequent HDO. The main product in the hydro(deoxy)genation of dihexyl ether was hexane, while hexanol and trace amounts of hexene isomers were detected as intermediates. In accordance with our previous work where hexanones and secondary hexanol were tested as model compounds, different hexene isomers were detected since 1-hexene and rapidly isomerize into cis-2-hexene, trans-2-hexene, cis-3-hexene and trans-3-hexene in presence of H2 and/or NiMo/Al2O3. An interesting transformation was observed during HDO of aldehyde. The formation of intermediates and products were not completely in accordance with the presented reaction pathway in Fig. 2. Beside hydrogenation and decarbonylation, aldol condensation occurred on the catalyst surface, while the corresponding intermediates and products were not observed in case of carboxylic acid or methyl ester experiments. The extension of reaction pathway network including aldehyde aldol condensation reactions is presented in Fig. 10 and thoroughly discussed in Section 3.4. The reasons why aldol condensation products were not observed during experiments with any model compound (except of hexanal) probably lie in much lower possibility of two aldehydes to appear on the neighbor sites and interact. Due to low formation and high hydrogenation rates of aldehyde, its concentration in the liquid phase and on the catalyst surface was orders of magnitude lower compared to the experiment where aldehyde was used as a model compound reactant. See Section 3.4 for further discussion. Despite the use of a sulphided NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, no sulphur-containing compounds were detected, probably due to negligible concentrations, below the detection limits. This is not in accordance with Senol research [10], who detected many of them. However, our past [26] and current DFT results rule out formation of any sulphur-containing compounds and also the H2S formation was detected to be negligible using the same catalyst in our previous work [25]."
10,Homogeneous hydrotreatment reactions,"3.3 Homogeneous hydrotreatment reactions In order to study the contribution of homogeneous hydrotreatment in the liquid phase, experiments without catalyst were performed at 250 °C. Palla and Senol [21,12] do not mention testing non-catalyzed reactions with 1-octanol and 1-heptanol over NiMo catalysts. However, the contribution of homogeneous reactions was close to zero, which is in accordance with our previous results, where no intermediates or products were formed in non-catalytic experiments using ketones and secondary alcohols. These findings are confirmed with DFT calculations. Activation barriers for one-step reactions between two alcohols yielding ether and water are all above 250 kJ mol−1 and thus inaccessible. As shown in [26], the same holds true for other non-catalytic reactions of alcohols, such as monomolecular dehydration into olefins. Should alcohols become protonated by hydrogen atoms in hydroxyl groups of neighboring molecules, traces of water or other sources of acidic protons, their reactivity would be markedly increased. For instance, activation barrier for conversion of 1-hexanol into dihexyl ether upon protonation is 33 kJ mol−1, while for 2-hexanol it is 96 kJ mol−1. Thus, results are as expected. Virtually negligible conversion in absence of a catalyst was found for hexanal, hexanoic acid and methyl hexanoate as well. Minor formation of hexanol and hexene isomers was detected in non-catalytic experiment with dihexyl ether. Miniscule formation of hexanal was detected with hexanoic acid non-catalyzed HDO. Hexanoic acid and hexanal were also detected in small amounts during non-catalyzed HDO of methyl hexanoate, while 1-hexanol was detected during dihexyl ether non-catalyzed HDO. All these conversions were below 3%. Senol, however, mentioned [14] that methyl heptanoate and methyl hexanoate do not react without a catalyst even at 300 °C. Results of non-catalyzed reactions are collected in Fig. 3 , showing the concentration profiles of reactants and detected intermediates and products. Kinetic parameters for the non-catalyzed reactions are presented in Table 3 , where constants for homogeneous isomerization and hydrogenation of olefins are taken from previous work, where detailed homogeneous and heterogeneous isomerization and hydrogenation of hexenes were explored in detail under the same experimental conditions [26]."
11,Heterogeneous hydrotreatment reactions,"3.4 Heterogeneous hydrotreatment reactions Mathematical modeling was performed to interpret reaction kinetic constants on the catalyst surface and activation energies for the individual transformation steps. Beside catalyzed reactions, contribution of non-catalyzed transformations was also included in mathematical modeling. Although the experiments have been performed with the aim to operate in the kinetic regime, namely in the absence of the internal (particles had been crushed and sieved) and external (vigorous stirring) mass transfer limitations, the criteria for their influence were tested. Since the Thiele modulus was always below 0.2 and external mass transfer criteria were several orders of magnitude below the threshold r n cat k n l a s c n l < 0.1 , it can be concluded that both the external and internal mass transfer had an insignificant effect on the global reaction rate. Reactivity of each model compound is discussed in detail below, while kinetic constants and activation energies obtained by mathematical modeling and some from DFT calculations are collected in Table 4 , while reactions listed correspond to the pathway network presented in Fig. 2. The regression and parameters sensitivity analysis showed that 95% confidence intervals of parameters determined by microkinetic modeling were in the range of 1–5%. 3.4.1 1-Hexanol In comparison to our previous study of secondary alcohols HDO, experimental results for primary alcohols show slower conversion with hydroxyl group on the terminal position (Fig. 4 ). This is a consequence of the inductive effect, where alkyl groups induced stabilization makes secondary carbocations more stable than the primary ones. Also, secondary alcohol is a better hydrogen donor in comparison to primary alcohol and can react faster, which was explained in Johnstone’s publication [34]. Recently, a computational study of primary and secondary alcohol, 1- and 2-propanol respectively, was carried out to rationalize reactivity difference of primary in secondary alcohols over Pt/Al2O3 catalyst in aqueous phase. The calculated reaction energies were higher (45 kJ mol−1) for the primary alcohol and lower (39 kJ mol−1) for the secondary alcohol, which is in accordance with this study [35,36]. DFT calculations confirm that hydrogenation of primary alcohols proceeds slower. While we previously calculated the activation barrier of 65 kJ mol−1 for conversion of secondary alcohols into olefins [26], this barrier is as high as 95 kJ mol−1 on primary alcohols. This is actually a two-step reaction, taking place on a vacancy site of the catalyst. In case of primary alcohols, both steps in fact have higher barriers. A one-step hydrogenolysis of 1-hexanol to hexane was found to have activation barrier of 115 kJ mol−1. See Section 3.6 for a detailed discussion of DFT results and Fig. 5 . Two main routes of 1-hexanol dehydration, proposed in accordance with our kinetic modeling and experimental results, are dehydration to 1-hexene or condensation to ether. Fast of cis-2-hexene, trans-2-hexene, cis-3-hexene, and trans-3-hexene formation after dehydration were experimentally proved to be formed from 1-hexene by catalytic or H2 assisted isomerization. Isomerization rates were taken from our previous study, since the reaction pathway mechanisms of primary and secondary alcohols overlap after the dehydration of each. The activation energies for hydrogenation of hexenes are low, 10 kJ mol−1, in comparison to hexanol dehydration, being as high as 150 kJ mol−1, according to the results collected in Table 4. Another hexanol transformation route proceeds through formation of dihexyl ether. In comparison to other dehydration routes, this one (Ea 5) exhibits the lowest activation energy, being 76.1 kJ mol−1. Modeling results show slower cracking of ether bond (k 4) in comparison with hydrogenation of olefins (k 1). As a result, high ether and negligible olefins concentrations were detected. Direct hydrogenolysis of hexanol into hexane was included into mathematical modeling as a third pathway of alcohol conversion. It was found to have a slightly lower reaction rate (2.40·10–2 mol L–1 min−1) compared to alcohol dehydration into olefins (1.13·10–2 mol L–1 min−1) when the temperature of plateau (250 °C) was reached (at 35 min). Additionally, activation energy of alcohol to hexane (Ea 3) hydrogenolysis was also slightly lower than alcohol to hexene (Ea 2) dehydration, being 94 kJ mol−1 and 150.0 kJ mol−1, respectively. This is in good agreement with our quantum calculations. Trace amounts of aldehyde were also detected, which is in accordance with Palla’s research [21], who suggested that dehydrogenation of 1-alcohol to aldehyde is reversible under these conditions. Hydrogenation reaction is nevertheless much more favorable at high hydrogen pressure of 5 MPa. 3.4.2 Dihexyl ether Experiments showed that dihexylether converts simultaneously into both alkene and alcohol (Fig. 6 ). Palla et al., however, [21] proposed that ethers dehydrate into alkanes in their study of HDO of 1-octanol over Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. In our set-up, isomers of olefins were detected during homogeneous HDO of dihexyl ether, proving the conversion into 1-hexene and olefins. Accordingly, activation energy for dihexyl ether conversion (Ea 4) is much higher than for hydrogenation of double bonds (Ea 1), i.e. 124.0 kJ mol−1 vs 10.0 kJ mol−1, respectively. 3.4.3 Hexanoic acid Many authors have investigated HDO of hexanoic acid, as carboxylic groups can be formed by catalytic processing of lignocellulosic feedstock, especially hexoses oxidation. Our experimental results show a good agreement with other studies regarding the reaction pathway network and mechanism (Fig. 7 ). From experimental results, three different pathways for deoxygenation of hexanoic acid are postulated. The main route is dehydration and hydrogenation to hexanal, which is either further hydrogenated to hexanol or, less likely, decarbonylated to pentane. Alternatively, hexanoic acid can be decarbonylated/dehydrated to pentene and further hydrogenated to pentane (as proposed by Senol et al. [12]) or directly decarboxylated to pentane, proved by CO and CO2 formation. When hexanol and unreacted hexanoic acid were present, esterification also proceeded as confirmed by detection of hexyl hexanoate. Compared to other model compounds, the first dehydration step in hexanoic acid transformation has much higher activation energy, resulting in highly temperature-dependent transformation. Consequently, the difference in reaction rates between the lowest and the highest tested temperature is substantial. Results of this work is in good agreement with the Senol’s [12,14], who proposed two different mechanisms for transformation of heptanoic acid (Cn-oic acid) into hexane (Cn−1): either through decarboxylation of heptanoic acid into hexane or dehydroxylation and decarbonylation to olefin (Cn−1 olefin) formation and further hydrogenation of double bond to hexane. Recently Hachemi et al. [33] proved priority deoxygenation pathway over Ni based catalyst with low decarboxylation contribution. The kinetic constants for hydrodeoxygenation were much higher compared to the decarboxylation kinetic constants. Same trend of modelled kinetic constants was established in our research based on experimental data, showed in Table 4. Our DFT calculations support the experimental data. Upon adsorption on the sulphided active site, CO(H) bond in the carboxylic acid is cleaved in an endothermic step (+128 kJ mol−1). The ensuing OH group later recombines with a hydrogen atom and leaves the catalyst as water. Hexanoyl radical quickly reacts with adjacent hydrogen atom to form hexanal. Carboxyl group cleavage is the rate-determining step with activation energy 160 kJ mol−1. Subsequent recombination into hexanal is a fast exothermic process. Decarboxylation of hexanoic acid has activation barrier of 223 kJ mol−1. Aldehydes are the most reactive oxygen-containing species (see also Section 3.5). This was confirmed with our DFT calculations, where activation barrier for hexanal hydrogenation into 1-hexanol is only 14 kJ mol−1. As shown in our previous work [26], activation barrier for hydrogenation of 2-hexanone is much larger with 45 kJ mol−1. See Fig. 8 for detailed mechanism. As further discussed in Section 3.5, high reactivity of hexanal has ramifications for end products. When using hexanal as a starting model compound, high initial concentration and high reactivity cause the formation of several products, including aldol products. When using hexanoic acid, its conversion into hexanal (and thus its concentration) is slow enough to react mostly to 1-hexanol. 3.4.4 Methyl hexanoate Methyl ester hydrodeoxygenation on NiMo/Al2O3 was extensively studied by Senol [12]. Detected intermediates and products in this work are in general in accordance with his results (Fig. 9 ). Senol proposed that acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of methyl hexanoate proceeds on the sulphided catalyst and yields hexanoic acid, while in this work a simultaneous cleavage of methyl group and hydrogenation to carboxylic acid is proposed. This mechanism was confirmed by extensive formation of methane in the gaseous phase already during the diminishing of the ester group in the liquid phase (see Supplementary information). Besides H3CO bond, also ROCOCH3 bond cleavage proceeds, the latter resulted in alcohol and aldehyde formation. Hexanal is furthermore quickly hydrogenated in hexanol. However, preferred HDO mechanism in tested conditions is through hexanoic acid and methane formation. The calculated kinetic rate constant for ROC–OCH3 bond cleavage (k 15 = 4.20·104 L mol−1 min−1) is much lower compared to H3CO bond cleavage (k 13 = 2.24·105 L mol−1 min−1), while the activation energy is much higher (Ea 13 = 114.6 kJ mol−1, Ea 15 = 57.0 kJ mol−1), reflecting high temperature dependency of the rate constant. At a low temperature, ester conversion was extremely slow, while at the highest temperature (275 °C), the final conversion of 97% was reached only after 120 min and resulted in significant concentrations of yet unreacted intermediates in reaction mixture, i.e. hexanoic acid, hexanol and hexyl hexanoate. According to the modeling results, the highest energy barrier required to be overcome during methyl hexanoate hydrodeoxygenation is present in the first step (114.6 kJ), where methyl group is being cleaved off and appeared as methane in the gas phase. Same reaction mechanism was proposed for both esters, i.e. methyl hexanoate and hexyl hexanoate. Since ester is formed from hexanoic acid and alcohol its transformation undergoes through same two reaction pathway as proposed for the methyl hexanoate HDO, specifically into hexanoic acid and hexane and in a smaller extent into hexanal and hexanol. Similar results were presented in few other publications [12,14,19]."
12,Aldol condensation reaction,"3.5 Aldol condensation reaction Wang et al. studied hydrogenation of hexanal and other different aliphatic aldehydes over sulphided NiMo/γ-Al2O3 in detail and developed an extensive reaction network for aldehyde hydrogenation and aldol condensation [16,18]. Similar results were obtained in our study when using hexanal as a model compound. The main HDO reaction pathway is still favored (producing alcohols, olefins and alkanes), although aldol condensation products, such as 2-buthyl-2-octenal, 2-buthyl-1-octanol, 6-dodecanone, were also detected. Many C12 olefin isomers were detected, having been formed with water elimination. Double bonds were subsequently readily hydrogenated and ultimately 5-methly-undecane was formed. The proposed reaction scheme is presented in Fig. 10 . Minor formation of 2-butyl-2-octenal formation was detected in non-catalytic experiment with hexanal. At the tested reaction conditions obviously first step of aldol condensation through water molecule separation can proceeds, marked with green arrow in the reaction scheme (Fig. 10). Activation barrier for hydrogenation step is too high to proceeds without the catalyst presence even though high hydrogen pressure is available. Catalytic HDO and aldol condensation reaction rate is fast and increases with higher temperature, however, conversion reached 100% at the tested reaction conditions. After 150 min at the 225 °C the product distribution is different as at the 275 °C, but not complete deoxygenation was reached in both cases. Higher is the temperature, higher is the HDO rate, resulting in hexane formation as the main product. However, the ratio between C12 products, which are mostly aldol condensation products, and C6 products is slightly higher at elevated temperature. At the temperature of 225 °C, the C12/C6 ratio is 0.24 and it increases to 0.28 at 275 °C. It can be concluded that selectivity towards aldol condensation increases with temperature as seen in Fig. 11 . Wang et al. mentioned that reaction behaviour strongly depends on the feed concentration, which can explain the formation of heavy products solely when as the starting model compound was hexanal. In case of hexanoic acid hydrodeoxygenation, only hexanal and hexanol were detected, without any heavy products. Hexanal is very reactive, undergoing several side reactions (such as aldol condensation) when present in abundant quantities. Confirming Wang research results the pathways are remarkably affected by differences in its concentration [16,18]. During the experiment with hexanal, hexanoic acid was detected in the liquid phase (confirmed by GC–MS and distinctive peak shape) in considerable concentrations, obviously due to hexanal disproportionation under considered conditions [37]. Hexanoic acid can furthermore react with hexanol, which is formed from hydrogenation of hexanal, yielding hexyl hexanoate. Similar distribution of intermediates, including the carboxylic acid, ether and ester compounds, was found by Wang et al. Nevertheless, the concentrations of hexanoic acid and hexyl hexanoate remained low. The dominant reaction pathway is presented with red arrows in Fig. 10."
13,Ab initio insights into main pathway reaction mechanism,"3.6 Ab initio insights into main pathway reaction mechanism To obtain additional insight into the reaction mechanism, DFT calculations were used on the most relevant pathways. The same methodology as in previous work is followed to provide a sensible comparison of results [26]. Again, we neglect regioisomerism and limit our investigation to one positional isomer of each compound class. This is because accuracy of our DFT calculations is of the same order as would be differences between positional isomers. Hydrogen binds to the catalyst dissociatively. Its atoms adsorb to bridge sulphur atoms, forming an acidic sulphydryl species, and to adjacent Ni atoms, forming hydridic species. As discussed later on, both are important for hydrogenation reactions. On vacant sites, however, deoxygenation reactions are favored. Hexanoic acid can react either over a sulphided (blue pathways in Figs. 5 and 8) or vacant (green pathways in Figs. 5 and 8) site. In both cases, the molecule of hexanoic acid orients parallel to the catalytic surface with oxygen atoms bound to surface Mo and Ni. Over the sulphided site, hexanoic acid is deoxygenated into hexanoyl intermediate in an endothermic step (+128 kJ mol−1) with a barrier of 160 kJ mol−1. This intermediate is very reactive and is quickly converted into hexanal (E A = 24 kJ mol−1). Alternatively, hexanoic acid can be decarboxylated or hexanal can be decarbonylated to yield pentane in both cases. These reactions proceed over a vacant site, but have small contributions due to high activation energies of 223 and 232 kJ mol−1; respectively (Fig. 12 ). Once hexanal is formed, it is rapidly hydrogenated into 1-hexanol over a sulphided site. Reaction mechanism is similar to that of 2-hexanol (see Ref. [26]) but faster, which is in congruence with experimental observations. Hydrogenation of the terminal C atom by the hydrogen atom from Ni (hydridic species) is almost non-activated with a barrier of just 2 kJ mol−1. The ensuing 1-hexoxy intermediate is then hydrogenated by the acidic hydrogen atom from the sulphydryl group in a rate-determining step with barrier of 14 kJ mol−1. Reduction of hexanal yields 1-hexanol, which was shown by experiments to be less reactive towards hydrodeoxygenation than 2-hexanol (see Ref. [26]). This difference in reactivity is expected since oxidation of primary alcohols is known to proceed faster than of secondary alcohols. Deoxygenation over the sulphided active site is unlikely with a barrier of 164 kJ mol−1. Direct hydrogenolysis via the attacking hydridic species to yield hexanal in one step (SN2 reaction) is possible with barrier of 115 kJ mol−1, but should be considered only at higher temperatures. Most probably, 1-hexanol would react over the vacant site. In the first step with a barrier of 67 kJ mol−1 (cf. value 65 kJ mol−1 for 2-hexanol), CO bond is cleaved and 1-hexanyl intermediate is formed. This intermediate is dehydrogenated into 1-hexene in a rate-determining step (E A = 94 kJ mol−1), which is much slower than for 2-hexanol (Fig. 13 ). Lastly, 1-hexene is hydrogenated into hexane over a sulphided active site (Fig. 13). First, terminal carbon atom is hydrogenated, yielding 2-hexanyl intermediate. In the following rate-limiting step, hexan is formed upon overcoming the barrier of 49 kJ mol−1. Catalytic hydrogenation of hexenes is largely unaffected by regioisomerism, as shown by our experiments and theoretical calculations. One should also pay attention to quick isomersiation of various hexenes. To track this in a mathematical model, we used the same approach as in Ref. [26]. Relevant reaction rate constants were considered to be in equilibrium at all times. Equilibrium constants had been obtained by DFT and are reported in Ref. [26]."
14,Conclusion,"HDO as one of the most useful catalytic transformation in biomass treatment for added-value chemicals production was studied in detail, where experimental results were supported with mathematical microkinetic modeling and DFT calculations. Obtained kinetic rates are in very good agreement with recently published work by Hachemi et al. on kinetic modeling of fatty acid methyl esters over nickel catalyst [33]. The same trend in the kinetic rates for methyl ester to carboxylic acid and further transformation to aldehyde and alcohol formation followed by dihydroxylation to alkane was observed. DFT calculations confirmed very fast transformation of aldehyde, which was also supported by literature data [33]. When aldehyde is formed during hydrotreatment of carboxylic acid and ester group, it follows the general HDO pathway. Experiments with high initial concentrations of hexanal model compound showed deviation from the main reaction pathway, as aldol condensation products were also formed. Higher temperature shifted the selectivity towards aldol condensation products (C12 products), due to negligible activation energy of aldehyde hydrogenation into primary alcohol. Primary alcohol can be involved in four different reactions; predominantly dehydration into olefin, direct hydrogenolysis into alkane, dehydration into ether and esterification into corresponding ester in case of carboxylic acid presence in the reaction mixture. Isomerisation of 1-hexene follows the same mechanism and agrees to the same thermodynamic equilibria and kinetic rate constants as determined for hexene isomers formed by dehydration of secondary alcohols."
