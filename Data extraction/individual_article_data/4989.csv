0,Introduction,"One of the environmentally fuels that can be used for many energy converters is hydrogen [1]. In recent years many attention is served for using nanomaterials for hydrogen storage [2–4]. Today, the decreasing of negative effects of fossil fuels have been attracted the most interest of scientists and they try to find the alternation of them [5]. On the other hand, because of the width application of hydrogen in the development of clean energy, hydrogen studied in several papers in the last decade [6]. In contrast to fossil fuels, hydrogen has several advantages such as eco-friendly, clean energy, recycle ability, safety and inexpensive [7]. Due to specific properties in comparison to bulk material, nanomaterial has great performance in the hydrogen storage field. One of the binary oxide compounds that are composed of cobalt and aluminum oxides is cobalt aluminate. Cobalt aluminate is the most famous intermediate aluminum metal [8]. Because of the specific properties of cobalt aluminate, it used a pigment industry and called Tenard’s blue [9]. The CoAl2O4 spinel nanostructure due to having high thermal resistance, electrical, optical and catalyst properties have wide applications in the various field [10]. In recent years it was widely used for coloration of rubber, glass, ceramic, fiber and so on [11]. Besides this unique property, it has significant optical [12], catalysis [13], and magnetic [14] properties and can be used in optical devices. Up to now there are many afford to the synthesis of cobalt aluminate with different methods such as coprecipitation [15], sol-gel [16], ultrasonic hydrothermal [17], combustion [18], microwave [19] and solid-state methods [20]. In order hand, in 1990, due to increasing in chemical material pollution and a bad environmental effect of them, green chemistry appearance [21]. Green chemistry is defined as a technique that leads to the design of chemical produce and process that decrease or remove toxic material from the environment [22]. Synthesis of nanomaterials with the help of chemical routs is required three kinds of reagents; a metal precursor, a reducing agent, and a surfactant or capping agent. By reducing each chemical reagent and replace with green materials, we can reduce the chemical synthesis hazardous [23]. Using a green plant extract instead of toxic agents is a method to synthesize nanomaterials. In this viewpoint, the enlargement of novel approaches for metal oxide nanoparticle synthesis utilizing different sources like plants, algae, fungus, bacteria and others can be deliberated as today’s main challenges. These routes are using non-toxic, environmentally friendly, benign reagents. Among the green chemistry approaches, the utilize of extracts of plant from leaves, roots, seeds, fruits or flowers are a particular attentiveness route, since the plants contain a diversity of chemical components, such as amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, flavonoids, etc. that can act as chelating/reducing/capping agents. These routes can coordinate the ions of the metal to form precursors of the polynuclear complex that lead to nanoparticles with narrow size distribution and high stability by thermal decomposition method. An overview of the literature indicates that there are a few investigations on the production of nanoparticles of cobalt aluminate using Sesame indium L leaves extract [24], Tamarind fruit extract [25], Opuntia dilleni extract [26], and Aloe Vera leaf extract [27]. (see Scheme 1 ) In this work, we used olive leaf extract as a precipitation agent for the synthesis of CoAl2O4 nanostructures. Also, preparation CoAl2O4 via green chemistry has been used as hydrogen storage material and to the improvement of the capacity TiO2, SiO2 and graphene have been applied. Graphene, TiO2 and SiO2 have been used to improve the performance of electrochemical hydrogen storage of the host. Graphene, a single-layer planar carbon sheet, has a special structure with superior physical characteristics that can communicate the ability of hydrogen absorption into the host materials. It is an inexpensive, chemically inert and low weight material. The chief advantage of using graphene in energy storage is the application of graphene by electrical, electrochemical, and chemical devices [28]. Nanoparticles of TiO2 have desirable photocatalytic and redox ability. These nanoparticles can catalyst water decomposition and progress the reduction/oxidation of hydrogen atom. As an example, the lecture reported that MWCNTs coated with TiO2 can storage more hydrogen than the pure MWCNTs [29]. According to the reported researches, the physicochemical properties of SiO2 nanoparticles can impressively improve hydrogen storage of the host materials characteristics [30]. The products were investigated by different analyses such as XRD, SEM, TEM and FT-IR that all of them confirmed the synthesis of pure CoAl2O4 and nanocomposites with nano dimension. Furthermore, to study the porosity of the products, BET analysis was served."

7,Synthesis of graphene (GR) from graphene oxide (GO),"2.6 Synthesis of graphene (GR) from graphene oxide (GO) In this work, the used GO was prepared by a modified Hummers’ method from natural graphite [31] and reduced through the described method in previous work [32]."

The black precipitation centrifuged and washed with distilled water and absolute alcohol, and dried at 100 °C for 12 h in a vacuum dryer."
9,Electrochemical systems,"2.8 Electrochemical systems Chronopotentiometry technique was employed to measure the hydrogen storage capacity of the electrodes. The charge and discharge cycles were performed by a three-electrode system. The Cu-samples, Ag/AgCl and Pt electrodes are used as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte was 6 M KOH aqueous solution. In this system, the potential difference was measured between the working and the reference electrodes, and a constant current was applied between the working and counter electrodes. To make an electrode of samples, copper foam of nano-size porosities was used as a substrate for the samples.To organize an electrode of samples, 0.1 g samples was homogeneously dispersed in 5 ml ethanol for 30 min. Then, a pure copper plate (1*2 cm2) is coated by a thin layer of sample at 80 °C (ethanol was evaporated and only sample adheres to the Cu plate surface). Then, prepared plates were emerged in 20 ml ethanol (to draw off unstable sample) and then were dried. The electrode was weighted before the coating in high precision scale with a resolution of 0.01 mg in order to measure the weight of the sample after coating. The difference between weight of working electrode before and after of coating is equal to mass of sample that was coated on working electrode [33]."
10,Results and discussion,"It can be observed (Fig. 1 a) the product is composed of Co with cubic phase (a = b = c = 8.1066 Ao). The peaks located at 19.39, 31.61, 37.17, 45.15, 55.97, 59.67, 65.57, 74.40 and 77.62 are related to (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), (440), (620) and (533) Miller indices, respectively that belong to Co product with JCPDS NO = 82–2252. The crystallite size of the Co sample was calculated 23.65 nm, via the Scherrer equation (d = 0.9 K/βcosθ) [34]. Fig. 1 b shows the XRD pattern of CoAl2O4/TiO2 (CT). It can be seen that the product is composed of two materials; one of them is CoAl2O4 with a cubic phase and the other one is TiO2 with anatase and rutile phase. The other pattern is related to CoAl2O4/SiO2 nanocomposite that due to the amorphous structure of SiO2 it shows only the CoAl2O4 miller indices with cubic phase (Fig. 1 c). The final pattern is related to CoAl2O4/graphene nanocomposite (Fig. 1 d). It can be observed that the pattern shows a peak located at 28° that belongs to the graphene structure. The other peaks are related to CoAl2O4 nanostructure with phase. It can be concluded that all nanomaterials such as pure CoAl2O4 and its nanocomposites with TiO2, SiO2 and graphene structure were synthesized successfully. Fig. 2. Shows the FT-IR spectra of the synthesized products. Fig. 2 a shown the FT-IR spectra Co Sample. The vibration peaks located at 546 cm−1 and 667 cm−1 are related to lattice vibrations of Co–O4 and Al–O6 that confirm the synthesis of cobalt aluminate. The peaks are seen at 1630 cm−1 and 3431 cm−1 are belonging to stretching and bending vibrations of O–H bonding of the water molecules adsorbed on the surfaces of the nanoparticles. In fact, due to the high activate surface of the synthesized nanostructures, they can adsorb water molecules on their huge surface. The small peak located at 2853 cm−1 and 2923 cm−1 are related to symmetric and asymmetric of C–H bond that can be attributed to olive leaf extract remaining on the product surface [35,36]. As can be seen in Fig. 2b, d and c, besides the CoAl2O4 peaks there are some peaks related to the TiO2, SiO2 and graphene structures. The broad peak located at 950 cm−1 is due to the lattice vibration of Ti–O–Ti. The vibrations at 517 cm−1 and 669 cm−1 are belonging to Ti–O bond vibration [37,38]. In the FT-IR spectra of the CS product (Fig. 2c), there are three peaks located at 476 cm−1, 556 cm−1 and 667 cm−1 that are related to stretching and bending vibrations of Si–O bond. The peaks at 556 cm−1 and 667 cm−1 are due to symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of O–Si–O bond. Furthermore, a peak located at 476 cm−1 belongs to the bending vibration of O–Si–O bond [39,40]. FT-IR spectra of CG is shown in Fig. 2d. The symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of C–H bond have appeared at 2850 cm−1 and 2924 cm−1 Also the peaks located at 1122 cm−1 and 1627 cm−1 are related to stretching vibrations of C–O and CC bonds [41]. The product size and morphology were studied by SEM images. As shown in Fig. 3 a pure CoAl2O4 shows sphere like besides cubic like nanostructures that can be attributed to different reasons such as nucleation and growth conditions. By synthesis of CoAl2O4/TiO2 nanocomposite and presence of TiO2 besides the CoAl2O4 nanostructure, the nucleation and growth conditions were changed and hence some aggregated nanoparticles were achieved. The aggregation is mainly due to the high surface energy of the synthesized nanostructures. There is no significant difference between CoAl2O4/TiO2 and CoAl2O4/SiO2 nanocomposites. However, the little difference is due to the difference between nucleation and growth conditions of TiO2 and SiO2. The morphology of CoAl2O4/TiO2 and CoAl2O4/SiO2 nanocomposites are nanoparticles. Nanoparticles of CoAl2O4/SiO2 nanocomposites are configured as bullets structure due to the special conditions of nucleation and growth, but these bullets are not seen in the morphology of the CoAl2O4/TiO2 nanocomposite. The SEM images of CoAl2O4/graphene nanocomposite is shown in Fig. 3d it can be observed that the product is composed of both zero and two-dimension nanomaterials that can be attributed to graphene and CoAl2O4 nanostructures. The SEM results showed the synthesis of CoAl2O4 nanocomposite changes the nucleation and growth conditions of the synthesis procedure that can affect the product morphology, directly. Performance of the Co, CT, CS, CG samples in electrochemical hydrogen storage under constant current (1 mA) were inspected by the galvanostatic technique in 6 M KOH aqueous medium. In the charging process, atoms of hydrogen are formed through the electrochemical decomposition of aqueous alkaline that these atoms move in the solution to the working electrode, then absorbed by prepared samples [42]. The atoms of hydrogen come out from the working electrode (process charging) [43]. The reaction of charge and discharge is displayed below: Samples (Co, CT, CS, CG) + ne- ↔ (samples + nH) + nOH- It must be mentioned that the mechanism of storage in the electrode of prepared samples is physical adsorption. Adsorption/desorption of atoms of hydrogen is done at ambient temperature and pressure. According to the previous lecture, the weak Van Der Waals bond is created between the hydrogen atom and material surface in physical adsorption. Instead, due to the strong chemical bond between the hydrogen atom and material surface needs to high pressure and temperature for hydrogen desorption in chemical absorption [44] Fig. 4 shows the discharge process curve of sample electrodes. The discharge capacity of Co electrode increased gradually from 150 mAh/g in the first cycle to 1750 mAh/g after 15 cycles (Fig. 4 a). As you can see in Fig. 4a, hydrogen storage discharge capacity from the 13th cycle to the 15th is almost constant. To improve hydrogen storage capacity was prepared composite CoAl2O4 spinel with TiO2, SiO2 and. Graphene. The addition of titanium dioxide to CoAl2O4 and the preparation of CoAl2O4/TiO2 composition, the discharge capacity increased to 2800mAh/g after 15 cycles (Fig. 4 b). The discharge capacity changes are very slow from the 9th to the 15th. Also, discharge capacity achieves 2000 mAh/g and 2700mAh/g by adding SiO2 and graphene to CoAl2O4, respectively (Fig. 4 c, d). the discharge capacity of the CT electrode is higher than the repeated charge and discharge cycle of sample electrodes has led to increasing discharge capacity. In the discharge curve, two obvious plateau of potential appears that indicates two different hydrogen adsorption sites [45]. To compare hydrogen storage performance, the coulombic efficiency of Co, CT, CS and CG, were calculated. The Coulombic efficiency is calculated using equation (1) which is a value less than 100, approximately [46]. (1) Q d ( d i s c h a r g e c a p a c i t y ) Q c ( c h a r g e c a p a c i t y ) × 100 Fig. 5 shows the charge capacity curve of samples in the 15th cycle. The coulombic efficiency obtained 62% ( 1750 2800 × 100 ) , 39% ( 2800 7100 × 100 ) , 47% ( 2000 4200 × 100 ) a n d 27 % ( 2700 10000 × 100 ) for Co, CT, CS and CG electrodes after 15 cycle, respectively. The Co electrode has coulombic efficiency higher than other electrodes. So it’s a better candidate for hydrogen storage. The production CoAl2O4 composition with TiO2, SiO2 and graphene increased but the Coulombic efficiency decreased. Material is a suitable candidate for hydrogen storage which has to charge time minimum and discharge time maximum and has high coulombic efficiency [47]. The N2 adsorption/desorption profile and pore size distribution of Co and CT electrodes (maximum discharge capacity relative to CS, CG samples) shown in Fig. 6 a and b, respectively. The Co and CT according to the IUPAC classification are type III isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop [48] (Fig. 6 a). Type III isotherm is typically found on solids containing agglomerates or aggregates of particles that form slit-shaped pores (edged or plates particles like cubes), with an irregular shape and/or size [49–55]. SEM images confirm Fig. 5 a, b confirms the type of hysteresis of Co, CT samples. As shown in Fig. 6 b, the size pore is 1–100 nm, which confirms the presence of meso- and macropores in Co and CT samples. The mean pore diameter was reported 16.73 nm for Co and 11.27 nm for CT sample. Also, the BET analysis showed 28.32 and 27.15 m2/g specific surface areas for Co and CT samples, respectively. To study more about the product size and morphology, TEM analysis was used. Fig. 7 shows the TEM image of CT sample. The observations confirmed the SEM results and approved the product is composed of very tiny particles with less than 30 nm diameter aggregated together."
