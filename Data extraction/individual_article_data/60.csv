0,Introduction,"The transformation of syngas (CO + H2) is an important pathway for the clean and efficient utilization of fossil resource [1–4]. Syngas can be obtained by the gasification of coal and biomass, as well as the reform of shale gas and natural gas. Products starting from syngas are all highly value-added chemicals, including paraffins, olefins, alcohols and other oxygenates. Among these products, the higher alcohols (C2+–OH, HAs) have attracted increasing attention due to their potential application in fuel additives, detergents, lubricants, and plasticizers [5]. Although the synthesis of HAs from syngas has been rapidly developed in the past decades, industrially viable catalyst systems remain highly demand in academia and industry to achieve sufficient alcohol selectivity [1,3]. Several catalyst systems have been developed for the synthesis of HAs by CO hydrogenation [3,5]. Among them, cobalt (Co)-based catalysts have attracted extensive attention due to the desirable carbon-chain growth ability, higher CO hydrogenation activity, and lower water–gas shift activity. Metallic Co is the active site for the cleavage of C–O bond and hydrogenation to yield paraffins, and thus the production of oxygenates is negligible over Co-based catalysts [1,5]. To promote the synthesis of alcohols, Co-based catalysts are generally modified by a second component such as Pd or Cu [6–8], which provides an active centre for CO non-dissociated adsorption. The dual active sites of CO non-dissociated and dissociated adsorption are responsible for the formation of alcohols. Furthermore, incorporating additives into Co-based catalysts is also extensively adopted to improve alcohol selectivity. Ding et al. developed a series of activated carbon-supported Co catalysts, which are promoted by La2O3 [9], Mn [10], CaO [11], and Al2O3 [12]. They found that the addition of these promoters facilitates alcohol production. According to the characterization results of used catalysts and the structure-performance of catalysts, they proposed that Co–Co2C behaves as the active sites of alcohols and the enhanced alcohol selectivity could be ascribed to the moderate Co/Co2C ratio. Density functional theory calculation further demonstrated that Co2C is highly active for CO non-dissociated adsorption and works like metal Cu [13]. He et al. [14,15] prepared CoGaZn/Al2O3 from layered double hydroxide precursors and investigated Ga promotion effect. The catalysts exhibited remarkable alcohol selectivity and CO conversion. They advocated that the Co0–CoGa alloy leads to the formation of alcohols, in which CoGa alloy functions as CO non-dissociated adsorption. Our previous work also investigated the promotion effect of Ga on the Co catalyst supported on activated carbon [16]. After exclusion of the formation of CoGa alloy and Co2C, they proposed that alcohols are produced over dual active sites of Co0–Co2+, in which the role of Co2+ is similar with Cu and Co2C. Chen et al. [17] proved that the interfaces Co0 and CoxO are responsible for the formation of alcohols in the investigation of structure evolution of Co0–CoxO over Co/CeO2 catalysts. In addition to the aforementioned catalyst systems, in recent years, perovskite-type oxides (PTO) have been introduced to synthesize HAs from syngas due to the flexibility in composition and structure. PTO is usually written as ABO3, in which A sites are usually alkaline earth metals or rare earth metals and B sites are generally transition metals [18]. Among them, A sites and B sites can be partly replaced by other metals. Tien-Thao et al. [19,20] reported that CuCo bimetal catalysts prepared from LaCu x Co1- x O3 perovskite precursors show good dispersion because of the uniform mix of metal ion at the atomic level in perovskite structure and exhibit impressive catalytic activity, especially for alcohol selectivity. Liu et al. explored a series of perovskite-related catalysts, including LaCo1- x Cu x O3 supported on ZrO2 [21], CuCo supported on LaFeO3 [22], La1- x Sr x Co0.65Ga0.35O3 [23], La1- x Ce x Co0.7Ga0.3O3 supported on ZrO2 [24]. Ao et al. [25] prepared La0.9Sr0.1Co1- x Ni x O3 perovskite catalysts and investigated the effect of Ni substitution on the catalytic performance. Benefiting from the enhanced interaction between the species in perovskite structure, all of the aforementioned catalysts presented good alcohol selectivity and catalyst activity. As an effective promoter, Mn has been extensively used over Co- and Fe-based catalysts in CO hydrogenation to improve selectivity toward the target products. For instance, Xiang et al. [26] reported that a ternary CuCoMn catalyst could show enhanced alcohol selectivity and stronger carbon-chain growth ability compared with binary CuCo catalysts under incremental CO conversion. This catalyst was very suitable for the production of alcohols, especially for C6+–OH alcohols. Their later work found that K-promoted CoMn catalysts presented outstanding oxygenate selectivity, with the sum of aldehyde and alcohol selectivity up to approximately 50% at a CO conversion of approximately 40% under the calculation of exclusion CO2 production [27]. The ratio of aldehydes/alcohols could be tuned via manipulating the reaction conditions. They proposed that the synergism of Mn5O8 and Co2C resulted in the yield of oxygenates. Sun et al. [28] prepared Na-promoted CoMn catalysts and found that this catalyst could produce considerable amounts of alcohols. The inclusion of Na favored the formation of Co2C, which plays a vital role in the yield of alcohols. Hence, considering the multiple advantages of Mn and perovskite structure in the synthesis of HAs, the combination of both is necessary. In present work, we have prepared LaCo1- x Mn x O3 perovskite-derived catalysts and studied the evolution of structure and Co species during calcination, reduction, and reaction. Although the promotion of Mn over Co-based catalyst in the synthesis of HAs was investigated by recent literature [10], the literature mainly proposed the core-shell structure of Co@Co2C induced by the incorporation of Mn and correlated it with the selectivity of alcohols and olefins. The quantified analysis of Co2C and the effect of Co2C/Co0 ratio on the product selectivity were hardly involved in literature. It may be due to the interference of AC support on quantified analysis. Therefore, in order to exclude the interference of catalyst support on the quantified analysis of Co2C, especially for carbon support, the present study prepared unsupported catalyst and studied the effect of Co2C/Co0 on alcohols selectivity induced by Mn addition, combined with the quantified characterization results. The correlation between structure and catalytic performance is established to determine the function by Mn substitution."
1,Experimental,
2,Perovskite preparation,"2.1 Perovskite preparation Perovskites (catalyst precursors) with various Mn molar ratios were prepared by citrate acid complex method. Typically, an appropriated amount of lanthanum nitrite, manganese nitrate, cobalt nitrate and citrate acid (CA) were simultaneously dissolved in deionized water to form a mixed salt solution with the mole ratio of CA/(La + Co + Mn) = 1. Afterward, the solution was stored overnight at room temperature and dried at 120 °C for another 12 h. Then, the dried sample was calcined at 350 °C for 5 h and at 650 °C for 5 h, respectively, with a ramp of 2 °C/min under static air. The obtained perovskites were termed as LaCo1- x Mn x O3 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4), where the x denoted the molar ratio of Mn."
3,Physicochemical characterization,"2.2 Physicochemical characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The samples were scanned from 10° to 80° with a scanning rate of 10°/min at an accelerating voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. All of the collected XRD patterns were analyzed by the JCPDS database. The particle size was measured by Scherrer formula at maximum intensity diffraction peak. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was measured by a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The sample was first flushed under the flow of Ar at 150 °C for 0.5 h to remove the moisture before cooling to 50 °C. Afterward, the temperature was raised to 900 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min in the flow of 10% H2/Ar. The H2 consumption was recorded by TCD. Temperature programmed reduction–mass spectrometer (TPR–MS) was performed at the same apparatus with TPR. The procedure was the same as the one of TPR and signal was collected by mass spectrometer. Methane was monitored at the same time with the m/z = 15. H2-temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD) was performed in same instrument as the TPR. About 200 mg sample was packed in a U-type quartz sample tube. The catalyst was first reduced for 5 h by pure H2 at 600 °C, subsequently cooled to 100 °C under H2 flow and then swept by Ar for 2 h to eliminate the residual H2. After the baseline was stable, the H2-TPD was performed from 100 °C to 600 °C at a speed of 10 °C/min and held at 600 °C for 2 h in the flowing Ar. The signal of desorbed H2 was detected by TCD. After that, the catalyst was purged with oxygen pulses until complete Co oxidation. The consumption of O2 was also detected by TCD. The corresponding relationship between TCD signal and H2 or O2 volume was calibrated afterwards by purged quantified volume gas, and then the quantitative amounts desorbed H2 and O2 consumption can be obtained. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with a FEI Tecnai F30 electron microscope. The instrument was operated at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. The catalyst was first ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol for 15 min and then dropped on carbon-coated copper grids. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an Omicron Sphera II photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα X-ray radiation source (hv = 1486.6 eV). The calcined and used catalysts were allowed to stick to the sample holder by conductive double-sided adhesive tape without any special pre-treatment in prior to measurement. For the reduced samples, the reduction proceeded on the in-situ cell at 500 °C for 3 h in the flow of H2 and then transferred to the XPS chamber to avoid any exposure to air. The charge correction was made according to Si 2p = 101.3 eV. The relative ratio of atomic on catalyst surface composition was calculated based on the following Eq. (1). (1) n i n j = I i / S i I j / S j In this formula, n, I, and S are the number of atoms, the area of characteristic peak, and atomic sensitivity factor, respectively. S is referenced to the handbook of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The catalytic performance was evaluated using a micro homemade fixed-bed reactor, in which a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 9 mm was placed. The catalyst was packed in the middle of the tube and a thermocouple was also placed inside contacting with the catalyst to monitor the catalyst bed temperature. About 0.3 g of catalyst was diluted with 1.7 g of quartz sand to achieve an isothermal zone. Before the catalytic tests, the perovskites were transformed into active catalysts by reduction at 600 °C for 5 h under a pure H2 flow. When the reactor cooled to the reaction temperature, the premixed syngas was introduced to eliminate the residual H2. Then, the reaction pressure was slowly elevated to 3.0 MPa. The syngas was composed of H2/CO/N2 = 6/3/1 molar ratio, in which N2 was used as internal standard. The mass-flow controllers were employed to adjust the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of feed gas. All products were on-line analyzed by two gas chromatographs. The hydrocarbons and oxygenates were analyzed by an Agilent 7890 GC equipped with a flame ionization detector and a KB-PONA capillary column. After the outlet stream passed through a cold trap to separate the gaseous and liquid products, the gaseous products, including CO, N2, CO2 and CH4, were analyzed by using a GC2060 gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD and a TDX-01 packed column. CO conversion (X CO) and product selectivity (Si ) were calculated by the following Eqs. (2) and (3) based on carbon basis. (2) X co = n co , i n l e t - n co , o u t l e t n co , i n l e t × 100 % (3) S i = M i × N i ∑ M i × N i × 100 % where n co , i n l e t and n co , o u t l e t are the molarity of CO at inlet and outlet, respectively; M i and N i are the molarity of product i and the carbon number of product i, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic performance,"3.1 Catalytic performance The various LaCo1- x Mn x O3-derived catalysts were evaluated under the condition of T = 270 °C, P = 3.0 MPa, WHSV = 4000 mL/(g∙h), and a H2/CO ratio of 2 to study the effect of Mn on the catalytic performance. The catalytic results are presented in the Fig. 1. In order to accurately and qualitatively analyze the products, the liquid products collected from cold trap over LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3 were analyzed by GC–MS as shown in Fig. S1. Note that, the unmarked GC peaks all assigned to corresponding isoparaffins and olefins. It could be found that the GC peaks for alcohols and olefins were totally divided. There were only straight chain alcohols and no branched chain alcohols in alcohol products by MS spectrometry. The products over LaCo1- x Mn x O3-derived catalysts were mainly alcohols, hydrocarbons, and minimal CO2. However, the reaction temperature in the present study was 270 °C, while the normal Co-based Fischer–Tropsch (FT) catalysts reaction temperature was at 200–220 °C [29,30]. The CO conversion of these catalysts was still below 30 mol% under typical FT reaction pressure and space velocity. It implied that the LaCo1- x Mn x O3-derived catalysts possessed inferior activity in CO hydrogenation. It could be related to the existence of abundant La2O3 inhibiting the CO conversion [9,31]. In addition, high reaction temperature is usually beneficial to improve the activity of water-gas shift reaction followed with high CO2 selectivity. Surprisingly, the selectivity of CO2 over the series catalysts was below 10 mol% and approximate to the normal Co-based FT catalysts. The similar phenomenon was also found over other perovskite catalysts in CO hydrogenation [22–24]. Therefore, this phenomenon could be explained by the unique perovskite structure and composition. In terms of catalytic activity and product selectivity, the sample without Mn-substitution showed a high CO conversion and CH4 selectivity, similar selectivity of olefins and C2+ paraffins with the Mn-substituted LaCo1- x Mn x O3-derived catalysts. In the present study, the selectivity of alcohols was as high as 10.3 mol% over LaCoO3 catalyst, while the traditional unmodified Co-based FT catalysts generally exhibited about 5 mol% alcohol selectivity [11,32]. This difference was principally attributed to the promotion of La2O3 [9,31,33]. The introduction of La2O3 could promote the formation of Co2C and then elevated the selectivity of alcohols. However, once the partially substituted of Co by Mn, the product slate over LaCo1- x Mn x O3-derived catalysts was significantly changed. The alcohol selectivity apparently increased from 10.3 mol% to at most 23.0 mol% over LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3. Meanwhile, the concentration of methanol declined from 45.3% to about 30% over all Mn-substituted perovskite-derived catalysts. Moreover, the selectivity of CH4 also greatly decreased from 48.3 mol% to approximately 30 mol%. Thus, the substitution of Mn was not only enhanced the production of alcohols, but also beneficial to supress the formation of undesired products like methane and methanol. Interestingly, even low level of Mn-substitution could induce great shift of product selectivity, but further addition of Mn only led to a decrease of catalytic activity. The similar phenomenon was also found in other investigation of Mn promotion on CO hydrogenation [10,34]. Among all Mn-substituted perovskite-derived catalysts, LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3-derived one exhibited second highest conversion and similar alcohol selectivity with other catalysts. Therefore, taking the activity and alcohol selectivity into considering, LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3 was the optimized catalyst precursor. In present study, the effect of space velocity and reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3 was also investigated. The results are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the CO conversion was elevated from 10.5 mol% to 24.5 mol% with the decrease of WHSV from 6000 mL/(g∙h) to 3000 mL/(g∙h), accompanying a negligible changed selectivity to alcohols. Table 2 presented the function of temperature on the catalytic activity and selectivity over LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3. The reaction temperature was mainly influenced on the conversion, but had little impact on the product selectivity, which is similar to the influence of space velocity. The long term stability behaviours of the catalysts with and without Mn were evaluated as illustrated in Fig. 2. Both catalysts exhibited obvious induction period in the first several hours of time on stream. After reaching stable status, there were almost unchanged in CO conversion and product selectivity for at least 100 h on stream. The results suggested that the perovskite-derived catalyst could show excellent stability."
7,Characterization of perovskites (catalyst precursors),"3.2 Characterization of perovskites (catalyst precursors) The XRD patterns of LaCo1- x Mn x O3 perovskites are showed in Fig. 3. All patterns presented strong reflexions corresponding to the presence of a well-defined perovskite structure with high degree of crystallinity and homogeneity. The XRD patterns of as-prepared perovskites with and without Mn-substitution exhibited the perovskite characteristic diffraction peak at about 33°, which indicated the successful formation of perovskite structure. In Fig. 3, the typical doublet peak at 32°–34° could be found over catalysts LaCo1- x Mn x O3 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3), revealing rhombohedral symmetry [25,35]. Moreover, the characteristic diffraction peak of perovskite shifted to lower 2θ values with the increase of Mn substitution amount due to the substitution of Co3+ by the bigger ionic radius Mn3+ [36,37], suggesting that the Mn ions have entered into the perovskite structure. As for the XRD of LaCo0.6Mn0.4O3, the perovskite characteristic diffraction peak was a singlet peak, indicating cubic symmetry [25,35]. In addition, no diffraction peaks related to the species of Co and Mn could be detected, which demonstrated that all cations entered into perovskite structure."
8,Effect of the Mn-substitution on the active phase,"3.3 Effect of the Mn-substitution on the active phase To investigate the phase change in catalysts after reduction, all samples were first reduced at 600 °C for 5 h by H2 and characterized by XRD. The results are presented in Fig. 4. For all samples, after the reduction, the perovskite structure was collapsed along with the disappearance of its characteristic diffraction peak and transformed into La2O3 (JCPDS-ICDD 73-2141), metallic Co (JCPDS-ICDD 15-0806). As for the Mn-substitution catalysts, the MnO (JCPDS-ICDD 78-0424) was also detected at the reduced samples, which suggested that the manganese species existed in the form of MnO at reduced status. The results indicated that, after the reduction, the obtained catalysts were mainly composed of La2O3, MnO and metallic Co along with the collapse of perovskite structure. To investigate the evolution of catalyst structure during the reaction, the used catalysts were also characterized by XRD. The results are presented in Fig. 5. For all samples, the diffraction peaks of perovskite disappeared which were similar with the reduced one, and the phases of metallic Co, La2O3, La(OH)3 (JCPDS No. 83-2034), LaOOH (JCPDS No. 77-2349), and LaCO3OH (JCPDS No. 26-0815) were detected. Among these species, La2O3 and metallic Co were formed from the decomposition of perovskite structure, La(OH)3 and LaOOH resulted from the reaction of La2O3 with H2O yielded during reaction, and LaCO3OH originated from the reaction of La2O3, H2O and CO2. It should be noted that Co2C (JCPDS No. 05-0704) was produced during reaction in all samples. The intensity of diffraction peak for Co2C increased with the addition of Mn and reached the highest at LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3. With further introduction of Mn, the peak of Co2C became weak and ambiguous, especially for the catalysts of LaCo0.7Mn0.3O3 and LaCo0.6Mn0.4O3. This may be induced by the decrease of Co content. The particle size of Co2C was calculated based on XRD result by Scherrer equation and was shown in Table 3. The diameter of Co2C increased from 8.0 nm over LaCoO3-drived catalyst to the maximum 16.0 nm over LaCo0.8Mn0.2O3-drived catalyst. The similar result was observed by other literature [10]. To determine the crystalline structure and directly prove the existence of Co2C, the TEM characterization for the used catalysts was performed and the typical images are summarized in Fig. 6. Well-defined lattice fringes could be found in the images. By comparison of the lattice spacing, the Co2C (1 1 0), Co2C (0 2 1), Co2C (1 1 1) could be identified, which further verified the formation of Co2C during the reaction. All observed Co2C species showed spherical morphology. There was no metallic Co species adjacent to Co2C, meaning that no core-shell structure between Co2C and Co0 formed during reaction."
9,Catalyst surface analysis,"3.4 Catalyst surface analysis The surface elemental composition of LaCo1- x Mn x O3-derived catalysts was investigated by a series of XPS characterizations. The results for the as-calcined catalyst precursors are compiled in Fig. 7. As shown in the Fig. 7A, there were two main peaks and a satellite peak in the Co 2p3/2 profiles of all calcined catalyst precursors. The two main peaks located at 780.4 eV and 779.4 eV were assigned to Co2+ and Co3+ respectively [10,38,39]. As for the Mn 2p spectra of all calcined samples presented in Fig. 7B, there were two main peaks appeared at 641.8 eV and 643.6 eV, which were correspond to Mn3+ and Mn4+ respectively [36,40]. Thus, the Mn species in the LaCo1- x Mn x O3 perovskite structure were the mixture of Mn3+ and Mn4+. A similar result was also reported in other perovskites containing Mn [36,37]. The reduced catalysts were also characterized by XPS and the results are summarized in Fig. 8. The fitting of Co 2p spectra in Fig. 8A showed that the peaks at 779.4 eV disappeared and a new peak appeared at 778.3 eV, which was corresponding to Co0 [38,39]. This result can be ascribed to the reduction of Co species. In addition, the relative peak intensity of Co0 to Co2+ gradually decreased with the addition of Mn. In order to quantitatively analyze the content of Co2+, an integration of XPS peaks area was conducted and the results are listed in Table 3. The incorporation of Mn indeed elevated the ratio of Co2+/(Co2++Co0) from 53.6% to at most 84.8%. It suggested that the introduction of Mn prohibited the reduction of Co species. The Co2+ species could be assigned to CoO phase originated from unreduced Co species. However, the CoO phase could not be detected by XRD for the reduced samples, suggested that CoO was uniformly distributed in the surface of catalysts. As for the spectra of Mn 2p, the results are shown in Fig. 8B. Deconvolution of Mn 2p3/2 and presented in Fig. 8B, the spectra showed three main peaks located at 640.9 eV, 641.8 eV and 643.6 eV, which were ascribed to the Mn2+, Mn3+, andMn4+, respectively [10,41,42]. Moreover, Mn2+ was the dominant manganese species. It demonstrated that manganese phase is mainly in form of MnO in the reduced catalysts. This is consistent with the result of XRD. Afterward, the used catalysts were measured by XPS characterization and the spectra are depicted in Fig. 9. The XPS profiles of Co 2p are compiled in Fig. 9A. It seems that the Co species were composed of Co2+ and Co0 in all used catalysts. Note that the Co2+ species could be ascribed to Co2C phase at some extent, according to the result of XRD, HRTEM and following investigation. The spectra of Mn 2p are presented in Fig. 9B. All used catalysts have similar Mn 2p spectra. And the manganese species for the used samples were composed of Mn2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+, which were similar with the distribution of Mn species for the reduced catalysts. Among them, Mn2+ was also the dominant species. Thus, MnO still was the dominant phase after reaction. In addition, the spectra of C 1s were also obtained to investigate the carbon species after reaction (Fig. 9C). After deconvolution and fitting peaks, the peaks could be divided into three peaks located at 283.3 eV, 284.5 eV and 288.5 eV, which were attributed to carbide, C–C bond for carbon and carbonate [31,33,43], respectively. The occurrence of the peaks for carbides further suggested the formation of Co2C during reaction. This finding agreed with the results of XRD and TEM. In addition, the intensity of carbide peaks increased with the addition of Mn and reached the highest over LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3. However, with further addition of Mn, the increment of the peaks intensity for carbide is not obvious that may be induced by the decrease of total Co amount in perovskite structure. To further analyze the ratio of Co2C in total Co species quantitatively, the XPS peak areas for Co element and carbide were integrated. Based on the peak areas and aforementioned formula, the ratio of Co2C in all Co-containing species was calculated (Table 3). The ratio of Co2C was enhanced with the incorporation of Mn. Therefore, the addition of Mn was beneficial for the formation of Co2C during reaction. The relative ratio of Mn to Co on the catalysts surface was calculated based on the XPS for Mn and Co. The data are compiled in Table 4. The ratio of Mn to Co for the calcined catalyst precursors was almost the same between the bulk and surface. However, after reduction, the ratio significantly increased. Thus, the aggregation of Mn on the surface of Co happened during reduction. The immigration was also reported in other Mn promoted Co-based catalysts [10,34]. Interestingly, the ratio for the reduced samples was almost the same with the used ones. It means that the aggregation of Mn mainly proceeded in the process of reduction and could be ignored during reaction. This aggregation is obvious only for the low Mn content catalysts, especially for LaCo0.95Mn0.05O3 and LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3. However, with further introduction of Mn, this aggregation became insignificant, especially for LaCo0.7Mn0.3O3 and LaCo0.6Mn0.4O3. A similar phenomenon was also reported previously [10,34]. The above phenomena can be explained in term of surface energy and the formation of bulk Mn oxide particles. The surface energy of Mn is smaller than that of Co, which could result in a preferential migration of Mn onto the catalyst surfaces during reduction [44]. When the Mn loading was very low, the atomic ratio of Co/Mn was high after calcination, but decreased to a lower level after reduction (Table 4). This finding indicated a significant aggregation of Mn onto the catalyst surfaces occurred. When the contents of Co and Mn was decreased and increased, respectively, this aggregation still existed but became insignificant by comparing with the Co/Mn ratios of oxidized reduced samples. Nonetheless, when the Mn content was further increased, the phases of Mn oxide particles besides Co species in reduced sample could be detected by XRD (Fig. 4)."
10,TPR–MS analysis,"3.5 TPR–MS analysis Co2C content on the used catalysts surface was quantitatively analyzed by XPS characterization. To investigate the amount of Co2C in the bulk catalysts, the measurement of TPR–MS for used catalysts was conducted. The MS signal for methane was recorded based on m/z = 15. The curves are summarized in Fig. 10. There were several methane formation peaks over all used catalysts. According to previous studies, the peaks located at 150–350 °C were assigned to the reduction of Co2C [43,45–49], in which methane was generated as following reaction: Co2C + H2 → Co + CH4 Many studies have analyzed the reduction temperature of Co2C. Karaca et al. [47] found that the formed Co2C during reaction could be reduced at 220 °C via in situ XRD characterization in the study of structure and catalytic performance over CoPt/Al2O3 catalyst for FT synthesis. Kwak et al. [45] observed that the peak assigned to the hydrogenation of synthesized Co2C in temperature-programmed hydrogenation characterization located at the range of 150–300 °C in the investigation of the effect of carburization on the catalytic performance of FT synthesis. Claeys et al. [46] also found that the formed Co2C in the process of carburization could be reduced at 200–250 °C in the treatment of temperature-programmed hydrogenation by in situ XRD. Therefore, the aforementioned assignment of peaks was proposed. The other peaks can be attributed to the gasification of carbon originated from the carbon deposition during reaction. Among them, the peaks at the range of 350–550 °C correspond to the hydrogenation of amorphous carbon or carbon oligomers [48–51]; the peaks located at 600–800 °C can be ascribed to the gasification of polymeric carbon or graphite carbon [16,48,49]. As seen in Fig. 10, the intensity of peak related to Co2C was increased with the addition of Mn and up to the maximum over LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3. But further incorporation of Mn, the increment of peak intensity was unobvious. That may be induced by the decrease of total Co species in perovskite-derived catalysts. To confirm the amount of Co2C, the spectra were quantitatively analyzed by integrating and fitting the reduction peak of Co2C. The results are listed in Table 3. The ratio of Co2C/total Co species elevated from 19.3% over LaCoO3 to at most 37.1% over LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3 while Mn was introduced into the perovskite structure. The value was approximate to the datum of XPS, which means that the incorporation of Mn promoted the generation of Co2C. This result further supports the conclusion of XPS."
11,Effect of Mn on the reduction and dispersion of Co,"3.6 Effect of Mn on the reduction and dispersion of Co The reductive property of catalysts was also assessed via TPR characterization. The results are depicted at Fig. 11, in which there were several reduction peaks in the spectra. These peaks were assigned to the two-step reduction of Co3O4 and the reduction of Mn species. The peaks located at 300–450 °C were mainly ascribed to the reduction of Co3O4 → CoO; the peaks above 550 °C could be attributed to the reduction of CoO → Co. These reduction temperatures were higher than those of normal Co3O4, in which the two-step reductions of Co3O4 were located at the range of 200–300 °C and 400–500 °C [29,30], respectively. Thus, the Co species in perovskite structure were more difficult to reduce than the normal one, which may be induced by the existence of excessive La [9,31]. In addition, the second reduction peaks distinctly shifted to the higher temperature after the addition of Mn, which indicated that the addition of Mn inhibited the reduction of Co species. As for the decrease of peak intensity over the Mn-substituted catalysts, it could be related to the catalysts containing less Co. Furthermore, the reduction of Mn species also should be addressed, especially for the high Mn loading samples. The state of Mn species in the calcined catalysts is the mixture of Mn4+ and Mn3+ based on the aforementioned XPS characterization. According to the previous reports and XPS profile for the reduced catalysts, Mn species can be reduced to MnO at about 390 °C [28,52]. Therefore, the first reduction peak was partially assigned to the reduction of Mn species. To quantitatively analyze the effect of Mn substitution on the reductive property of Co, the degree of reduction for Co species was also evaluated via O2–titration measurement. The results are summarized in Table 5. The degree of reduction apparently decreased with the incorporation of Mn. The values varied from 68.5% over LaCoO3 to the minimum value of 32.6% over LaCo0.6Mn0.4O3. It further proved that the addition of Mn suppressed the reduction of Co species. The finding agreed with the results of XPS and TPR characterization. Furthermore, the degree of dispersion for Co was also measured by H2–TPD. The datum are listed in Table 5. The degree of Co dispersion also gradually decreased with the introduction of Mn. The values declined from 3.6% over LaCoO3 to the minimum value of 1.9% over LaCo0.7Mn0.3O3. Thus, Mn could prohibit the Co dispersion. These values were largely lower than the usual Co-based catalysts, in which the degree of Co dispersion was usually approximately 10%. This deviation may be induced by the high-temperature calcination and the existence of abundant La [9,31]."
12,Correlation of catalytic performance and structure,"3.7 Correlation of catalytic performance and structure The catalysts derived from LaCo1- x Mn x O3 perovskites were prepared by citrate acid complex method. The catalytic performances showed that the catalysts produced considerable amount of alcohols and the selectivity of alcohols rose from 10.3 mol% over LaCoO3-derived catalyst to the maximum value of 23.0 mol% over LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3-derived catalyst. However, the perovskite derived catalyst after reduction was mainly constituted by La2O3, MnO and metallic Co, along with the collapse of perovskite structure. It was also found that partial Co species were transferred to Co2C during reaction. Generally, the transformation of Co2C from metallic Co leads to the increment of alcohol selectivity, which occurs in the first several hours during reaction and corresponds to induction period [47]. Therefore, it could be explained why the alcohol selectivity was increased in induction period. In addition, as for the generation of alcohols by CO hydrogenation, a general consensus is that the dual active sites for CO non-dissociation and CO dissociation are essential [1,53]. In general, Co0 is the active site for the CO dissociation, while Co2C has been proposed to be responsible for CO non-dissociation [9,13]. The adsorbed CO on the surface of metallic Co dissociates into C* and O*, which will be hydrogenated and yield CHx and H2O. As for the mechanism of C–C chain growth, there are two different perspectives, i.e. CO insertion and the coupling of CHx, which both happened on the surface of metallic Co [54]. The function of CoC2 only provides some non-dissociated adsorption CO for CO insertion in the formation of alcohols. Therefore, the C–C chain growth site is metallic Co, not CoCx. The detail mechanism of C–C chain growth was shown in Fig. S2. Ding et al. [9] found that the improvement of alcohol selectivity was accompanied with the formation of Co2C according to the results of XRD characterization for the used catalysts in the investigation of the promotion of La on the synthesis of alcohols for Co catalyst supported on activated carbon. They claimed that the formation of Co2C led to the enhanced production of alcohols. Wang et al. [33] calculated the relative ratio of Co2C/Co0 based on the intensity of corresponding main peak in XRD characterization for the used catalysts and correlated it with alcohol selectivity. According to XRD analysis of used catalysts, the same relation between the relative ratio of Co2C/Co0 and alcohol selectivity was established [11,13]. A moderate ratio of Co2C/Co0 was beneficial for the improvement of alcohol selectivity. Therefore, the increased Co2C content favors the synthesis of alcohols. In the present study, the formation of Co2C was identified by XRD, XPS and TEM characterizations. According to XPS and TPR–MS results, the addition of Mn promoted the formation of Co2C and then elevated the ratio of Co2C/Co0. Hence, the promotion of Mn on the alcohols production could be ascribed to the increment of Co2C/Co0 ratio and the dual active sites of Co2C–Co0 were responsible for the synthesis of alcohols. In addition, Co2+ originated from the unreduced Co species was retained in the process of reaction. The synthesis of alcohols via Co2+–Co0 dual active sites should be considered. However, considering the predominant Co species existing in the form of Co2C during reaction, especially for the Mn-containing catalysts, the enhancement of alcohols induced by Mn existence was mainly ascribed to the contribution of Co2C. The catalyst surface basicity and acidity play a vital role in the product selectivity. The basicity of the catalyst is beneficial for the adsorption of CO and promotes the production of alcohols [55,56], while the acidity facilitates the dehydration of alcohols and then yields ethers [57]. Hence, we conducted CO2–TPD and NH3–TPD to monitor the change of catalyst surface basicity and acidity induced by the introduction of Mn. As shown in Fig. S3, there were several CO2 desorption peaks in all samples. Among them, a small peak located at 100–200 °C existed in the sample of LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3, while this peak was absent in LaCoO3. In order to confirm the assignment of this peak, the CO2–TPD for MnO2 was conducted. As shown, there was a shark and strong CO2 desorption peak at the same temperature. Therefore, the small peak in LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3 could be ascribed to the desorption peak due to MnO2 originated from the decomposition of LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3 perovskite. Although there was a similar shape of CO2 desorption peak in LaCoO3 and LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3, LaCoO3 showed bigger peak area, especially at low temperature range of 150–250 °C. It meant that more basicity sites existed in LaCoO3. However, it should be noted that a large proportion of desorption peak in LaCoO3 was below reaction temperature 270 °C, which belonged to weak basicity sites and were unstable under reaction condition. Hence, these weak basicity sites might not affect the product selectivity. In order to precisely investigate the effect of catalyst surface basicity on product selectivity, the integration of CO2 desorption peaks above 270 °C was conducted. The amount of CO2 uptake above 270 °C was 16.1 μmol/g over LaCoO3 and 16.5 μmol/g over LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3, respectively. The negligible difference between them suggested that the doping of Mn does not significantly change the quantity of strong basicity sites on the catalyst surfaces. The NH3–TPD profiles were shown in Fig. S4. The results were similar with that of CO2-TPD. As for the sample of LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3, the small peak at 100–200 °C was also ascribed to the presence of MnO2 originated from the decomposition of LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3 perovskite. Considering the weak acidity sites below 270 °C were unstable under reaction condition and they could hardly affect the product selectivity, the integration of NH3 desorption peaks above 270 °C was conducted. The amount of NH3 uptake above 270 °C was 8.5 μmol/g over LaCoO3 and 9.0 μmol/g over LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3, respectively. It meant that the doping of Mn could not change the quantity of strong acidity sites on the catalyst surfaces. Therefore, to sum up, addition of Mn does not change the quantity of strong acidity/basicity sites, although they are the key factors altering the product selectivity. The premier promotion effects of Mn on the formation of alcohols should be ascribed to the increment of Co2C/Co0 induced by the addition of Mn. Furthermore, based on catalytic performance, the addition of Mn effectively suppressed the formation of undesired methane and methanol, thereby enhancing the selectivity of highly value-added long-chain oxygenates, which was generally observed over other Co-based catalysts in CO hydrogenation [58]. As for the rationale behind, the typical viewpoint is that Mn species mainly decrease the hydrogenation ability through the electron interaction of Co–Mn to generate some Coδ+ [58]. However, recently, Bell et al. proposed that the specific surface environment of a decrease in the ratio of adsorbed H to CO originates from the weakened C–O bond as promoted by the Lewis acid–base interactions between Mn2+ of MnO islands immobilized on the Co surface and the O atom of CO adsorbates adjacent to the MnO islands [34]. A similar claim was also proposed by Ding et al. [10] and verified by CO dissociation and disproportionation experiments. In addition, it should be noted that the micro-environmental of C-rich and H-lean originated from the electron interaction between Mn2+ of MnO and Oδ- of CO was beneficial for the synthesis of alcohols [2,56]. Therefore, Mn promotion for the production of alcohols was partially ascribed to electron interaction from this perspective. Interestingly, although Mn affected the catalytic performance, further addition of Mn exhibited almost no change in product distribution. Unfortunately, the substitution of Mn had a detrimental effect on CO conversion. The CO conversion decreased notably from 30.8 mol% over LaCoO3-derived catalyst to a minimum value of 8.3 mol% over LaCo0.6Mn0.4O3-derived catalyst. The conversion over Co-based catalysts is determined by the quantity of metallic Co sites, which is dependent on the Co dispersion and reducibility, and also affected by the evolution of Co species during the reaction, i.e., the formation of Co2C species. According to the above characterization results, the addition of Mn can not only decrease Co dispersion and reducibility, but also promote the formation of Co2C. Both of these effects will result in the decrease of metallic Co sites and eventually lead to the variation of conversion. The results of relative ratio of Co to Mn based on surface element analysis from XPS characterization indicated that the decrease of Co dispersion and reducibility can be explained by the accumulation of Mn species on the Co surface, especially in the process of reduction, which hinders the exposure and reduction of Co species."
13,Conclusion,"The catalysts derived from LaCo1- x Mn x O3 perovskites were evaluated for the synthesis of HAs by CO hydrogenation. The substitution of Mn not only facilitated the production of alcohols but also suppressed the synthesis of undesirable products, i.e., methane and methanol. The maximum alcohol selectivity reached 23.0 mol% over the LaCo0.9Mn0.1O3-derived catalyst, which was almost twice higher than the Mn-free one. There was about 75% selectivity to C2+–OH among total alcohols. The catalyst could sustain stability in terms of CO conversion and selectivity to HAs for at least 100 h. Co2C species was proved to be generated in the process of reaction. Quantitative analysis by XPS and TPR–MS revealed that Mn facilitated the formation of Co2C species, which are highly active for the CO non-dissociated adsorption. Therefore, we believe that the yield of alcohols can be attributed to the dual sites of Co0–Co2C. The enhanced production of HAs was benefited from the increment of Co2C content essentially due to the partial substitution of Co by Mn. This finding would shed some light on the preparation of new catalysts using perovskites as precursors for the synthesis of HAs by CO hydrogenation."
