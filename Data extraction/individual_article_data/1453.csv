0,Introduction,"Internal combustion engine is considered as a vital part of the vehicles for decades. However, the emission of environmental pollutants from these engines has become a serious concern in recent years. The rapid depletion of carbon-based fossil fuels and inconsistent increase in petroleum fuel price has led to take fast initiative to introduce alternative sources of fuel both for engines and furnaces [1–7]. Liquid alcohol fuel such as methanol and ethanol, hydrogen, syngas, and biogas are some of the fuels which could reduce the dependency on the conventional diesel and often show considerable reduction in emission. In the outlook of above issues, dual fuel engine has gained much attention in recent years. Dual fuel engine is a slight modified diesel engine which utilizes a high volatile liquid fuel or high-octane gaseous fuel mixed with air, either in the intake manifold or through direct injection into the cylinder. The resulting air fuel mixture is then ignited after compression with the addition of small amount of pilot fuel. The pilot fuel acts as a source for the ignition of surrounding gaseous fuel [8–10]. Diesel engines are capable of operating on wide range of renewable fuels like biodiesel, alcohols, and gaseous fuels. Researchers have explored the use of such renewable fuels to the strengthen the Compression Ignition (CI) engine performance at reduced emission norms [11–13]. From the beginning of the last century, many researchers were interested in operating conventional compression engines using renewable gaseous fuels [14–16]. One of such promising fuel is hydrogen as it does not contribute towards additional carbon content. Mehmet Akcay et al. [17] operated a hydrogen-diesel/biodiesel blends with a hydrogen flow rate up to 40LPM, which lead to considerable reduction of brake specific fuel consumption up to 12.5% compared to diesel. However, for lower hydrogen flow rate, Mohammad O Hamdan et al [18] investigated the supplement of 4LPM hydrogen has boosted the engine efficiency without any trace of knock. Apart from free carbon behavior, hydrogen supplement resulted in considerable increase in formation of N O X . Several studies have shown this increment of N O X with further increase in hydrogen content which is due to high combustion temperature [19–20]. Due to the limitations of compression engines when it comes to reaching the auto gaseous fuel ignition temperature, researchers realized the need for using a liquid fuel as a pilot fuel in a dual-fuel compression engine. In above perspective, fuels extracted from biomass has great potential to mitigate the amount of green-house emission [21–22]. Biodiesel is one of them, which is obtained through transesterification of triglyceride oil with alcohol. The most popular fatty acid esters are obtained from the cooking oil, as it has similar properties of diesel and are readily available in the local markets. Biodiesels are renewable, environment friendly, biodegradable, and nontoxic compared to conventional diesel [23–25]. However, major concern in using this cooking oil is its high production cost which is mainly due to high price for pure oil. Researchers have reported that the major variables that affect the biodiesel production is the expenses for raw materials [26]. To overcome the above issue, use of Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) is considered as best practice for biodiesel production. In past years, WCO in large quantities are commercially used as animal feed. The investigations conducted by European Union showed that, cooking oil used for frying purpose contains harmful compounds which return backs to the food chain through consumption of animal meat. Even though careless disposable of this WCO would damage the natural resources like water and vegetation. So efficient use of these WCO contributes towards the enhancement of economy and waste management. However, many researchers have reported that the usage of WCO biodiesel resulted in increased N O X formation. This increment can be attributed towards the injection retardation, ignition delay, high viscosity, more inherent oxygen, and increased combustion phase [27]. The dual fuel technology with hydrogen obtained from renewable sources such as solar and wind would provide a complete renewable dual fuel CI engine operation which would have greater impact on the reduction of diesel consumption. Surya Kanth et al [28] introduced hydrogen into a CI engine to enhance the Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) with engine running with edible Rice Bran oil biodiesel and non-edible Karanja oil biodiesel. The hydrogen assistance increased the BTE of engine by 1.6% using rice bran oil biodiesel higher than Karanja oil biodiesel while a reduction of 38% CO emission was achieved. With the same outcome for enhancing the BTE, M. Senthil Kumar et al [29] operated a dual fuel CI engine using hydrogen and Jatropha oil biodiesel. An increase of 2% was achieved in BTE with a reduction of 20% in smoke opacity. With same increase as that of smoke, N O X formation also increased with reduced CO and HC emission. Several studies of using different biodiesel such as waste cooking oil [30], cashew nutshell [31] and tea seed oil [32] or with diesel/biodiesel blend [33–35] can be seen in the literature. As dual fuel is a promising way to enhance the thermal efficiency with low smoke, it sometimes experiences low efficiency when the introduced fuel falls below minimum value which mainly due to the lean burn condition as the intake induced fuel finds difficulty in forming homogenous mixture with incoming air [29]. This drawback can be overcome by introducing a gaseous fuel with high flame velocity and high flammability range. So, introducing small quantity of hydrogen can result in higher efficiency and can mitigate the negative effect of biodiesel usage in CI engine. Since WCO biodiesel combustion is a less intense process, hydrogen assisted co-combustion aids in enhancement of engine performance and reduced emission [36–37]. This study covers different engine parameters, such as the engine load, engine speed, injection timing, compression ratio, and different hydrogen mass flow rates. Many researchers have investigated the use of hydrogen in CI engine with biodiesel as pilot fuel. As not much literature has reported about the engine parametric study of dual fuel engines operating using WCO biodiesel with hydrogen boost at atmospheric conditions. The key focus of the present study is to investigate the engine performance when it comes to the brake thermal efficiency, maximum pressure rise rate, indicated mean cylinder pressure, and engine emissions (opacity, CO, NOx, CO2)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Waste cooking oil biodiesel fuel prepartions and specifications,"2.1 Waste cooking oil biodiesel fuel prepartions and specifications Biodiesel from WCO was prepared by transesterification process using a base catalyst. The WCO was collected from the local restaurants located in the university campus. For biodiesel production, required quantity of WCO was measured and placed in the standard transesterification reactor, that was previously reported in past works [38–39]. The WCO was heated to required temperature with continuous stirring. 1% of Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) in 20% of methanol solution was prepared 5 min prior to addition. The biodiesel was then dried, filtered, and used, and its physiochemical properties are shown in Table 1 ."
3,Experimental setup,"2.2 Experimental setup The experimental setup includes a four-stroke, single cylinder 0.5-liter Ricardo E6 Variable Compression Ratio (VCR) engine, which is mainly used in household generators, heavy duty lawn movers and auto-rickshaws. The engine was coupled with a 22 kW and 420 V rated electrical dynamometer. The engine was modified to operate on dual fuels: diesel as a pilot fuel and hydrogen as a primary gaseous fuel. This engine can perform analysis of VCR in terms of brake power, indicated power, frictional power, brake mean effective pressure, indicated mean effective pressure, specific fuel consumption, heat balance, thermal efficiency, mechanical efficiency, and combustion analysis. The variation of most functions deciding engine performance can be achieved through smart LabView based software. All the test engine specifications and details are reported in Table 2 . Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the engine setup and measurement instrumentation. The engine setup is equipped with a smart data questioning system that allows users to control and monitor all the engine signals. Also, the engine’s load, speed, and fuel mass flow rate could be controlled. The system data was collected at a high sampling rate of 50 kHz to handle the cylinder combustion pressure and crank angle timing signals. The collected data file includes at least six combustion cycles. For data processing, the cycles were overlapped on the top of each other and synchronized using the crank angle signals for averaging and further analysis to compute the peak combustion pressure. All the engine parameters, such as the engine speed, load, cylinder pressure, crank angle, and torque were measured using a high sampling data acquisition system. A smart LabView program was developed at home to handle all the required measurements and data processing for estimating engine performance. Sampling frequency of 50 kHz is used to collect pressures for (at least six combustion cycles) for off-line averaging and analysis. After overlapping the synchronized combustion cycles and averaging all the data from the mid compression stroke to the mid expansion stroke, the maximum cylinder pressure, main indicated pressure, pressure rises rate, brake thermal efficiency, and emissions were determined. Table 3 shows all the used measurement instrumentations devices, brand names, and estimated uncertainties."
4,Experimental procedures,"To investigate the effects of the dual engine performance and the emissions using the used cooking oil biodiesel as a pilot fuel supplemented with hydrogen as a gaseous fuel, the present study covers a range of testing parameters and conditions, as described in the following points: (1) The engine load varied from 2 to 10 Nm. (2) The pilot diesel fuel injection timing varied from 20° to 45° BTDC in steps of 5°. (3) The engine speed covered a range of 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30 rev/sec. (4) The mass of the gaseous fuel m’g varied from 0 to 18.04 LPM (at a constant mass of the admitted pilot fuel m’p, about 17 mLPM), (5) The mass of the pilot diesel fuel m’p varied from 9.9 to 15.79 mLPM (at a constant mass of the gaseous admitted fuel m’g, about 11LPM). The data collection for all the measured signals and data processing for the results were handled using a smart LABVIEW interface program. The program acquired raw data at a high sampling rate of 50 kH: combustion cylinder pressure, crank angle, engine speed, and engine torque. The collected data file includes at least six combustion cycles. For the data processing, the cycles were overlapped on the top of each other using the crank angle signal for synchronization. The cycles were averaged, as shown in the below relations. The averaged results were used to calculate the peak combustion pressure, maximum pressure rise rate, indicated mean effective pressure, heat rate, and thermal efficiency. This data collection and analysis method was used by the references [41–42].

5,Results and discussion,"The cylinder combustion pressure vs crank angle signals graph for one combustion cycle under the conditions of 21 rev/s, compression ratio of 22, 8–10 Nm loading, and 35° BTDC injection timing (represented in case 1.2) is shown in Fig. 2 . This is a sample of the similar signals acquired under different flow, engine conditions, and fuel blends for six or more engine cycles."
6,Engine speed effect,"4.1 Engine speed effect Fig. 3 shows the effect of the engine speed based on the test cases from Table 4.1 , cases 1.1 to 1.5 on the engine thermal efficiency, engine brake torque (Nm), indicted mean effective pressure (Bar) and maximum cylinder pressure (Bar) as presented in Fig. 3a. The CO (ppm), NOx (ppm), and opacity (%) emissions are presented in Fig. 3b, whereas dP/dθ (Bar/deg) and SFC (g/kW-hr) presented on Fig. 3c. Fig. 3 shows the effect of the engine speed, which ranges from 18 to 30 rev/sec in speed increments of 3 rev/sec, on the engine thermal efficiency, engine brake torque in (N.m), and indicted mean effective pressure. The IMEP in Bar and maximum cylinder pressure (Pmax in Bar) are presented in Fig. 3a. The CO (ppm), NOx (ppm), and opacity (%) emissions are presented in Fig. 3b, which shows an increase in the maximum combustion pressure rate. The (dP/dθ)max was calculated in (Bar/deg), and the specific fuel consumption SFC was calculated in (g/kW- hr), as shown in Fig. 3c. The engine conditions were fixed CR = 22, the biodiesel was injected at IT = 35° BTDC at the rate of 12 mLPM, the supplement hydrogen had a fixed flow rate of = 11 LPM, and the brake torque ranged from 5 to 7.5 N.m. The increase in the engine speed improved the mixing level between the air and the fuels, resulting in more efficient combustion, higher flame speed, and better volumetric efficiency, especially when supplementing hydrogen to the air intake. As a result, the thermal efficiency increased from 7 to 10%, and the brake torque also increased. It is evident from Fig. 3a that thermal efficiency and brake torque increased as engine speed increases. Thermal efficiency accounts an increase from 23% to 29%. It is significant to realize that as engine speed increases, the mixing nature between the air and fuels becomes more homogenous and hydrogen addition enhances the combustion due to high combustion velocity resulting in more efficient combustion and increase in combustion temperature [37]. However, no change was seen for IMEP and maximum pressure as engine speed increased. From Fig. 3b it is seen that as engine speed increases corresponding increases is noted for NOx, this due to the increase in combustion temperature. As a result of efficient combustion, there was a considerable reduction in CO emission. The opacity value also increased as engine speed increased, and it was considerable at high speed. This due to that as engine speed increases more amount of air intake and high flame speed of hydrogen causes rapid reaction with the incoming excess air which gets easily ignited in premixed combustion [17]. Also, hydrogen addition substitutes the oxygen which in turn enriches the mixture causing higher opacity [44]. The opacity is presented in Fig. 3b, and it shows an increase with the increase in the engine speed. This is also shown in the study of Hamdan et al. [43], in which the pilot fuel flow rate increased with the increase in the engine speed, while the hydrogen flow was kept constant. As it is easier for hydrogen to react with existing oxygen, liquid fuel seems to lack oxygen, so the opacity increases in the exhaust gases. However, the indicated mean effective pressure and maximum pressure did not change. With the increase in the engine speed, the combustion temperature and NOx emissions increased, and as a consequence of the more complete combustion, the CO emissions decreased, as shown in Fig. 3b. Fig. 3c shows reduction in the maximum combustion pressure rate and SFC as engine speed increased. This is mainly due to the reduction in residence time which leads faster, and smoother combustion resulted in reduction of combustion pressure. As thermal efficiency increased a corresponding reduction can be seen in SFC [45]. The maximum pressure rise rate (dP/dθ)max slightly decreased due to the faster and smoother combustion, see Fig. a–c. Finally, Fig. 3c shows the reduction in the specific fuel consumption as the thermal efficiency improved."
7,Effect of the engine load (variable mass of hydrogen fuel),"4.2 Effect of the engine load (variable mass of hydrogen fuel) Fig. 4 illustrates the effect of variation in flow rate of hydrogen admitted into the intake based on the test cases from Table 4.2 , cases 2.1 to 2.6 on the engine thermal efficiency, engine brake torque, indicted mean effective pressure and maximum cylinder pressure as presented in Fig. 4a. The CO, NOx, and opacity emissions are presented in Fig. 4b and dP/dθ and SFC presented on Fig. 4c. Fig. 4 shows the effect of the variable supplement hydrogen flow rates, which ranged from 0 to 18 LPM in increments of 4 LPM, on the engine thermal efficiency, engine brake torque (N.m), and indicted mean effective pressure. The IMEP in (Bar) and the maximum cylinder pressure (Pmax in Bar) are presented in Fig. 4a, and the CO (ppm), NOx (ppm), and opacity (%) emissions are presented in Fig. 4b. The maximum combustion pressure rise rate (dP/dθ)max was calculated in (Bar/deg), and the specific fuel consumption SFC was calculated in (g/kW- hr), as shown in Fig. 4c. For the fixed CR = 22, the fixed engine speed was 21 rps, the biodiesel was injected at IT = 35° BTDC, the fixed biodiesel flow rate was 17 mLPM, and the brake torque ranged between 2 and 6 N.m. As the volume flow rate of the supplemented hydrogen increases with the same constant biodiesel mass flow rate, the results in Fig. 4 show an increase in the engine thermal efficiency, cylinder maximum pressure, and engine brake torque, which is maybe because the hydrogen fuel presence increases the combustion temperature and augments the mixing, as the flame moves faster compared with diesel fuel, as shown in Fig. 4a, and a similar behavior was also noticed in [18]. As a result of increasing the hydrogen amount, the engine produces more torque and IMEP output. The increased flow rate of hydrogen resulted in rapid movement of flame front which might have contributed towards rise in combustion temperature, augmenting the mixing behavior and high combustion temperature resulting in efficient combustion process [46]. So, an increment was observed for thermal efficiency and engine brake torque as hydrogen flow rate increased. Fig. 4b shows that as flow rate of hydrogen increases, emission of NOx, CO and opacity increased. Due to faster movement of flame front which resulted in rise in combustion temperature there by increasing NOx emission [47]. Since hydrogen reacts rapidly with the available oxygen which leads to deficiency of air combustion [48]. This deficiency causes poor combustion of biodiesel which resulted in increment of opacity and CO emission. These increase in the opacity may be reduced by controlling liquid fuel injection timing – which will be presented later in Section 4.4 for the effects of injection timing of the liquid pilot fuel. Fig. 4c depicts reduction in SFC with increase in the hydrogen flow rate. This reduction was expected, as the thermal efficiency increased. Even though the deficiency of biodiesel was observed at high hydrogen flow rates, most of the energy during combustion was contributed by hydrogen burning as the heating value of hydrogen is much higher than that of biodiesel [17–18]. In the same figure, the highest levels of combustion noise can be observed as estimated by the maximum pressure rise rate. The change in pressure rate produces attenuation and vibration in engine block before it releases from the engine as combustion noise [49]. So, higher the pressure rise rate larger the combustion noise. The maximum pressure rise rate is shown to increase with adding more hydrogen, which clarifies the faster flame propagation and the faster combustion that leads to the higher pressure rise rate. Over the past years, numerous methods have been investigated for combustion noise evaluation and analysis. Among these methods, the maximum of the in-cylinder pressure rise rate has been the most intuitive tool for combustion noise assessment; e.g. [50–54]. It has been shown by many references that if the combustion pressure increases with high rate, it causes noise during the combustion process. The rate is higher in diesel engines compared to spark ignited engines. The higher the rate of pressure increase the higher the intensity of the noise that may rise to acoustic level and causes engine knocks. This pressure waves propagates thorough the engine structure and produces external noise and also causes engine block vibration [55]."
8,Effect of pilot fuel flow rate,"4.3 Effect of pilot fuel flow rate Fig. 5 shows the effect of the variable pilot biodiesel flow rate, which ranges from 9 to 15 mLPM based on the engine thermal efficiency, engine brake torque in (N.m), indicted mean effective pressure (IMEP in Bar), and maximum cylinder pressure (Pmax in Bar), as shown in Fig. 5a. The CO (ppm), NOx (ppm), and opacity (%) emissions are shown in Fig. 5b. The maximum combustion pressure rise rate ((dP/dθ)max in (Bar/deg)) and the specific fuel consumption (SFC in g/kW- hr) are shown in Fig. 5c. The fixed operating conditions were CR = 22, the fixed engine speed was 21 rps, the biodiesel was injected at IT = 35° BTDC, the hydrogen supplement was at a fixed flow rate of = 11 LPM, and the brake torque ranged between 3 and 10 N.m. The tested cases are case 3.1 to 3.6, as listed in Table 4.3 . Fig. 5a shows that the engine thermal efficiency increased in the early stages of increasing the biodiesel mass flow rate, and this increase became less aggressive with the increase in the fuel flow rate. The brake torque followed a similar trend with the increase in the biodiesel mass flow rate. The increase in the torque and thermal efficiency was a result of injecting more pilot liquid biodiesel. As the pilot mass was increased, the diffusion flow size might have become bigger in size to more effectively burn the hydrogen, and more heat was released. The maximum cylinder pressure and indicated mean pressure show a more conservative behavior with a slightly reducing rate over the whole range. The results suggest that combustion gets richer with more injected biodiesel, which increases the output brake torque and power, having roughly the same IMEP and Pmax over the used range of biodiesel flow rate. Thus, on average, the engine generated the same power. The effects of increasing the biodiesel flow rate on the NOx, CO (ppm), and opacity (%) emissions are shown in Fig. 5b. With the increase in the biodiesel flow rate, an increase in the CO emissions can be noticed. Meanwhile, the effect on the NOx emissions was not strongly pronounced, and the resulting values were almost at the same levels. This behavior may be due to the fact that the more biodiesel fuel injected to the engine, the more energy is consumed toward evaporating the liquid fuel, which in turn quenches the combustion flame and reduces the combustion temperature. As a result, less or similar NOx formation is expected, and more soot is also expected due to the lower flame temperature, similar to the CO emission results, which can be used as an indicator to estimate the soot emissions. Another reason that might have caused the CO and opacity to increase is the competence between the hydrogen and the biofuel in getting the oxygen atoms. As the biodiesel increased, more liquid diesel lacked oxygen, which might have increased the CO and opacity in the exhaust gases. It can be noticed that the smooth burning of the gaseous fuels was because of the increase in the pilot flame volume, which is a direct result of the increase in the pilot biodiesel flow rate. This in turn leads to a reduction in the maximum cylinder combustion pressure and pressure rise rate. This trend was not clearly pronounced in the results, as shown in Fig. 5c. In the same figure, we can also see that the specific fuel consumption (sfc) was decreasing at a high rate at the early stages, and then it started to slow down as the biodiesel flow rate increased. This trend was expected, and it followed the engine thermal efficiency trend."
9,Effect of pilot fuel injection timing,"4.4 Effect of pilot fuel injection timing Fig. 6 shows the effects of the variable pilot biodiesel injection timing, which ranged from 20 to 45°BTDC at a fixed condition, on the engine thermal efficiency, engine brake torque in (N.m), indicted mean effective pressure (IMEP in Bar), and maximum cylinder pressure (Pmax in Bar), as shown in Fig. 5a. The CO (ppm), NOx (ppm), and opacity (%) emissions are shown in Fig. 5b. The maximum pressure rise rates of the combustion (dP/dθmax in Bar/deg) and the specific fuel consumption (SFC in g/kW-hr) are presented in Fig. 5c. The fixed engine conditions were CR = 22, the fixed engine speed was 21 rps, the fixed biodiesel flow rate was 11 mLPM, the supplement hydrogen was fixed at a flow rate of = 11 LPM, and the brake torque ranged between 1 and 5 N.m. The tested cases are cases 4.1 to 4.6, as shown in Table 4.4 . The effects of the biodiesel fuel injection timing on the engine performance and emissions when hydrogen was supplemented through the intake are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6.a through c show the results of the engine thermal efficiency, which clearly decreased when the injection timing advanced from 20° to 45° BTDC. An early injection would cause too much pressure rise before the end of the compression stroke, which reduces the output power and hence reduces the engine output torque and thermal efficiency. The cylinder maximum pressure and indicated mean effective pressure results display a magmatic behavior, where the values increased to some optimum value around the injection timing 20–30° BTDC and then started decreasing. The increase in the maximum cylinder combustion pressure was alleged with the advancement of the liquid diesel fuel injection BTDC. This behavior is believed to be because the combustion process was taking place during the compression stroke, which consequently increased the maximum cylinder combustion pressure. Fig. 6c shows that the generated engine noise, which is represented by the pressure rise rate, increased with the advancement of the pilot fuel injection BTDC. This may be due to the fact that by moving the pilot fuel injection forward, the fuel enters the combustion chamber at low temperature and pressure, causing an increase in the ignition delay period. Therefore, more liquid fuel accumulates, which leads to bigger chunks of fuel burned at the same time, resulting in a higher-pressure rate and more generated combustion engine noise. The specific fuel consumption, which is shown in Fig. 6c, increased with the advancement of the injection timing. As stated earlier, advancing the injection timing reduces the output thermal efficiency. The injection timing needs to be optimized for maximum thermal efficiency and minimum exhaust emissions. The retard in the injection timing of the pilot biofuel may compensate the increase in the CO, NOx and opacity if the Hydrogen gas is added; e.g. in condition exist in Fig. 4. Fig. 6b shows the results of the engine emissions, which suggest an increase in the CO emissions and a decrease in the NOx emissions. By moving the pilot fuel injection forward results in lowering of in cylinder temperature due accumulation of more amount of biodiesel which cools the combustion chamber. Since WCO biodiesel has higher viscosity and retardation of injection timing causes accumulation of biodiesel in combustion chamber which leads to improper spray atomization, non-uniform mixing of incoming mixture which result in poor combustion thereby increasing CO emission and opacity [22,49]."
10,Conclusions,"The effect of different engine parameters and load conditions on the performance and emissions of a dual engine has been investigated. Dual fuel engine used in this study was a modified diesel engine that operated on waste cooking oil biodiesel as a pilot fuel and a hydrogen supplement as a boosting gaseous fuel. The major outcome from this study are as follows. – Adding hydrogen gas to the engine resulted in an increase in the engine’s thermal efficiency and torque output. Consequently, the CO, NOx, and opacity emissions increased in the exhaust which can be reduced by retarding the liquid fuel injection timing. – Variation in engine speed, flow rates of hydrogen and pilot fuel (WCO biodiesel) showed similar trend in combustion characteristics. As dependent parameter increases, a similar increase was noted for thermal efficiency and brake torque. – Retarding the injection timing, considerable reduction in thermal efficiency and brake torque was observed. – The ease reaction behavior of hydrogen with incoming air led to the deficiency of oxygen for WCO biodiesel which showed increased opacity of exhaust gas for every test result. – Emission of CO increased for every variation except for the increase in engine speed because high engine speed enhanced the combustion process. – The emission of NOx showed similar trend except for variation in pilot fuel injection timing. As retarding the injection timing, more liquid fuel accumulates result in cooling the combustion process. – For every case, thermal efficiency and SFC showed inverse relation, as increase in thermal efficiency resulted in corresponding reduction in SFC. – Indicated mean effective pressure and maximum combustion pressure were not much pronounced as they were constant except for the variation of pilot fuel injection timing. – The diesel engine was capable of burning the biodiesel, which was derived from waste cooking oil, without any engine modifications. However, adding the hydrogen supplement improved the overall performance. – The use of hydrogen can enhance the performance of the engine and reduce the exhaust emissions if injection timing of the biofuel is controlled. According to the above observation, with increase of hydrogen content resulted in increased engine performance and reduction in CO emission with same WCO biodiesel flow rate."
