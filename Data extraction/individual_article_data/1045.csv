0,Introduction,"Tunable production of bio-oil derivatives such as fuels and value-added chemicals from sustainable bioresources has been an area of increasing research interest in recent years [1,2]. For example, pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass leads to the production of phenols, aldehydes, ketones, hydrocarbons, and various oxygenated compounds [3–6]. Furfural (FF) is an intermediate precursor generated by the pyrolysis of hemicellulose-rich biomass used for biofuel upgrading and fine organic synthesis [2,7–9]. FF upgrading process represents a versatile oxygen reduction reaction that can convert FF into furfuryl alcohol (FFA) via hydrogenation, tetrahydrofuran (THF) via hydrogenation, cyclopentanol (CPL) via ring-opening hydrogenolysis, or 1,2,5-pentanetriol via hydrodecarboxylations, which are mainly used in renewable fuels, medicines, and environmentally benign solvents [1,2,4,5,8,10–14]. The development of effective catalytic systems to control the upgrade of FF has increasingly been the focus of recent research for tunable production of FF derivatives, leading to the development of nanocatalysts and various effective solvents [15]. Especially, the development of chemically stable catalysts and experimental conditions suitable for hydrogenation are the two key factors for the production of tunable bio-oil compounds. Recently, several homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts such as Ru-, Pd-, Pt-, Ni-, Cu-, Ir-, Rh-, Co-, Mo-, and their combinations have been observed to effectively catalyze FF hydrogenation [5,8,9,16–23]. These monometallic and bimetallic catalysts are mostly immobilized on solid supports including carbon-based substrates, zeolites, mesoporous alumina, hydroxyapatite (HAp), commercial γ-Al2O3, and a commercial amorphous silica alumina (ASA) [24–27]. Furthermore, recent studies have built upon the popularly used solid substrates to synthesize bimetallic Ru/Zr-MOFs, Ni/C, Pd/Al2O3, Pd-Ru/Alumina, and Pd-Ru/Zeolite based hybrid catalysts, which exhibited efficient catalytic conversion of FF into the desired products [25,27–29]. However, these solid substrates are easily deactivated because of the severe oxidation and coking effects, which reduce their recyclability. Hence, these catalysts could not provide reasonable catalytic reactivity. These issues could be resolved by developing a physicochemically stable and catalytically active two-dimensional (2D) platform that could facilitate the development of high-performance catalytic systems. Two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been widely researched recently as an effective catalytic platform for the hydrogenation of bio-oil compounds [30]. Specifically, 2D h-BN exhibits excellent chemical and oxidation resistance, electronegative characteristics, and thermal stability—it exhibits higher stability than the alumina-based catalysts. Defect-laden h-BN has recently been used for the hydrogenation of olefins into propene, benzylideneacetophenone, (E)- and (Z)-1,2-diphenylethene, octadecene, and cyclohexene under mild reaction conditions [31]. Similarly, Pd-Fe core–shell nanoparticles immobilized by BN nanosheets (NSs) exhibited superior catalytic activities with highly effective Suzuki–Miyaura reactions, while the Pd–BN NS nanocatalyst exhibited higher hydrogenation activity for nitroaromatics and catalyst recyclability, thus indicating that h-BN served as a promising substrate for designing heterogeneous catalysts [32]. Also, recent studies show that Ru serves as an active catalytic material for the hydrogenation of FF into its derivatives [29,33]. Likewise, bimetallic Ru-Pd alloyed NPs are being widely applied as effective nanocatalysts in the hydrogenation of several phenols, aldehydes, and ketones [9,16,18,21,28,29,33]. These findings suggest that the incorporation of alloyed Ru-Pd with immobilized h-BN hybrid may enhance the hydrogenation of FF leading to higher selectivity of the desired products. In addition to the catalyst, a suitable reaction solvent is required to improve the conversion efficiency and selectivity of the desired products. Therefore, recent research has been increasingly focused on determining effective solvents that can improve the selectivity and yield of the desired products [1]. In fact, water can enhance the solubility of FF compared with the other solvents, resulting in enhanced selectivity for FFA, and THFFA formation via water dissociation over the Pd/α-Al2O3 catalyst at a lower reaction temperature of 100 °C [34]. This is because the water molecules dissociate to produce H and OH species that can change the hydrogenation pathways of FF, which can be used for tuning the selectivity of the products [35]. On the other hand, protic solvents of methanol, n-amyl alcohol, and 2-propanol lead to the higher yield of THF over Pd/C and Ni/CN which can be attributed to the activation of the FF via hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group of the alcohol and carbonyl oxygen of furfural, whereas the noticeable amount of ethers and acetals were detected [36,37]. These results suggest that the reaction solvents can significantly affect the activity of the catalyst and reaction pathways during hydrogenation. In this context, the nature of the nanocatalyst plays an important role in FF conversion and selectivity of desired products, while the selection of a suitable solvent is significant for tuning the products [38]. To the best of our knowledge, the development of the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst and solvent-dependent hydrogenation of FF into tunable selectivity of FFA, THFFA, furan, and CPN in the presence of Ru-Pd/BN has not been demonstrated. Herein, we present a versatile approach towards the design and synthesis of self-assembled Ru-Pd NPs immobilized with BN nanocomposites (Ru-Pd/BN NCs) via microwave irradiation for 30 s. The formation mechanism of Ru-Pd/BN NCs was established based on the SEM, HR-TEM with EDS, and XPS analyses. The obtained Ru-Pd/BN NCs were used as a novel catalyst to achieve the maximum FF conversion with the highest yield of FFA ever reported in the literature. Furthermore, this study provides insights into the effects of the solvents, temperature, and reaction time on the hydrogenation of FF with tunable production of FFA, THFFA, furan, THF, and CPN. The possible reaction pathways were established based on the experimental results. Furthermore, date-tree biomass-derived bio-oil was used as the real sample for hydrogenation studies over the Ru-Pd/BN NCs catalyst. The results showed that the Ru-Pd/BN NCs exhibited high stability over several runs, thereby confirming their suitability for industrialization."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The following chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification: sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 99.0%), ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate (RuCl3·xH2O, 99.98%), palladium(II) chloride (PdCl2, 99.99%), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%), ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH, 99.8%), ethanol (CH3CH2OH, 99.8%), acetone (CH3COCH3, 99.8%), BN (nanoplatelets, lateral dimensions < 5 μ), furfural (C5H4O2, 99%), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (C5H10O2, 99%), and cyclopentanone (C5H8(=O), 99%)."
3,"Synthesis of self-assembled Ru nanospheres (NPRs), Ru-Pd NPRs, and Ru-Pd/BN NCs","2.2 Synthesis of self-assembled Ru nanospheres (NPRs), Ru-Pd NPRs, and Ru-Pd/BN NCs The self-assembled Ru and Ru-Pd nanospheres were rapidly synthesized via a conventional microwave oven using sphere-like SDS micelles. For synthesizing the Ru NPRs, l M of SDS was dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water, and the SDS-aqueous mixture was sonicated for 30 s and magnetically stirred for 20 min. Then, 0.5 M of RuCl3·xH2O was added to the active SDS-micelle suspension and stirred for another 10 min to form a stable Ru(III)-SDS-micelle mixture. Next, 5 mL of NaBH4 solution (0.1 M in 10 mL deionized water) was added to the above-mentioned Ru(III)-SDS-micelle mixture, which was then placed in a microwave oven operating at 1100 W and 2.45 GHz for 30 s. The solid precipitate was separated and washed with deionized water followed by ethanol. The final solid precipitate was collected and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 70 °C. A similar method was used to synthesize Ru-Pd NPRs and Ru-Pd/BN NCs: For the synthesis of Ru-Pd NPRs, 0.25 M of RuCl3·xH2O and 0.25 M of PdCl2 were dissolved in 40 mL of SDS-aqueous mixture, sonicated for 30 s, and magnetically stirred for 20 min. Subsequently, 5 mL of NaBH4 (0.1 M) reducing agent was slowly added (~2 mL/min) to the Ru(III)/Pd(II)-SDS-micelle mixture solution under magnetic string for 10 min. The complete mixture was placed in a microwave irradiation process for 30 s and the precipitate was separated after washing with deionized water and ethanol, successively. Finally, the obtained precipitate was dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 70 °C. For synthesizing the Ru-Pd/BN NCs, 100 mg of the commercial BN nanoplatelets with lateral dimensions of < 5 μm were dispersed in 40 mL of deionized water through sonication to form a stable white colored suspension. Then, l M of SDS was added to the BN suspension under sonication for 30 s, resulting in the formation of sphere-like SDS micelles on the surface of the BN NSs (SDS-BN). Next, 0.25 M of RuCl3·xH2O and 0.25 M of PdCl2 salts were added to the SDS-BN suspension under magnetic stirring for 20 min to form a homogeneous Ru(III)/Pd(II)-SDS-BN mixture. Then, 5 mL of NaBH4 (0.1 M) was slowly added to this mixture under magnetic stirring for 10 min and placed in a microwave oven for 30 s. The Ru-Pd/BN precipitate was separated after washing with deionized water and ethanol, successively. Finally, the obtained Ru-Pd/BN sample was dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 70 °C."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with EDS (JEOL JSM-7610F FEG-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Titan TEM 300 kV) with selected area diffraction (SAED) were used to analyze the morphological, structural, and elemental compositions of the Ru NPR, Ru-Pd NPR, and Ru-Pd/BN NC samples. An X-ray diffractometer (XRD, PANalytical Empyrean) at 40 kV and 40 mA was used to analyze the crystalline nature and crystal sizes of the Ru NP, Ru-Pd NP, and Ru-Pd/BN NC samples. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALab Mk2, EX06 Ion Source) was used to determine the chemical structure and compositions of the Ru NPR and Ru-Pd/BN NCs samples. The Gaussian-Lorentzian function was used to deconvolute the obtained spectra. The BET specific surface area and pore size distribution (BJH) of the Ru-Pd/BN NC was carried out by physical N2 adsorption/desorption at 77 K using Quantachrome Autosorb 06 surface area analyzer. Prior to N2 adsorption–desorption measurements, an amount of ~ 170 mg sample was degassed under vacuum (10−6 mbar) at 250 °C for 12 h."
5,Catalytic hydrogenation of furfural,"2.4 Catalytic hydrogenation of furfural The catalysts, time, and temperature-dependent hydrogenation experiments were performed in a modified 100 mL stainless-steel autoclave (Parr reactor-bench top, S.N.4790) equipped with magnetic stirring, a gas inlet and outlet, and a thermocouple. Prior to the catalytic test, the catalysts were annealed at 250 °C for 4 h under H2 (99.9%) to reduce the oxidation layer on their surfaces. For testing the catalyst performance, 500 mM of FF was added to 40 mL of deionized water (FF-water mixture) and 10 mg of various catalysts namely Ru NPRs, Ru-Pd NPRs, and Ru-Pd/BN NCs were separately added to the FF-water mixture solution, stirred for 5 min, and then transferred into the abovementioned stainless-steel autoclave. The autoclave vessel was purged twice with Ar/H2 (95/5) and the final H2 pressure (99.9%), stirrer speed, and reaction temperature were set at 10 bar, 300 rpm, and 150 °C, respectively. The reaction time was set to zero until the desired temperature of 150 °C was reached with ramp rate of 5 °C/min. After the reaction was complete, an ice bath was used to step-down the reaction temperature and the residual pressure was slowly released into the saltwater. Additionally, the effects of the reaction time (between 0.5 and 4 h) and the temperature (in the range of 50 to 400 °C) on the catalytic tests were investigated to understand the reaction mechanism and various product formations; all the results have been estimated in molar percentages. A control run (without any catalyst) was also performed for the comparison of results. The obtained hydrogenated compounds and their corresponding molar percentages were determined through a gas chromatograph (GC–MS) equipped with a DB-1 ms ultra-inert column (122-0132JI) and GC-FID for the product identification purposes. The system was interfaced with an Agilent OpenLAB CDS ELChrome Software with NIST 1B mass spectral library. The split ratio was set as 1:200, and the oven temperature was increased from 100 to 250 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The following equations were used to estimate the FF conversion, yield, and selectivity of the hydrogenated compounds: F F c o n v e r s i o n % = I FF - F FF I FF × 100 F F A s e l e c t i v i t y % = m FFA I FF - F FF × 100 Y i e l d % = m FF I FF × 100 Where IFF is the initial FF concentration in M, FFF is the final FF concentration in M, and mFFA is the final number of moles of FFA in obtained products. Additionally, recycling tests were performed for five consecutive cycles to evaluate the stability of the as-prepared Ru-Pd/BN NC based catalyst. The cyclic catalytic tests were conducted with 500 mM of FF in 40 mL of water as solvent, using a catalyst dosage of 10 mg at a reaction temperature of 150 °C and reaction time of 1.5 h. In each cycle, the used catalyst was recovered by centrifugation and washed five times with acetone and ethanol and then dried in a vacuum oven for 2 h. The results were plotted as number of cycles vs FF conversion and yield of the FFA in percentages. Furthermore, the used Ru-Pd/BN NC catalyst was characterized by SEM with EDS and XRD analysis to determine its stability upon recycling."
6,Hydrogenation of bio-oil derived from date-tree biomass,"2.5 Hydrogenation of bio-oil derived from date-tree biomass Date-tree waste derived bio-oil was used to estimate the catalytic activity of the Ru-Pd/BN NC catalyst towards the real time application of the nanocatalyst. Our previous study had reported the detailed production of bio-oil from the lignocellulosic-rich date-tree waste via fast pyrolysis at 500 °C for 30 min under N2 atmosphere [3]. The composition of the freshly prepared bio-oil was determined to be 46 wt% of acids, 35 wt% of aldehydes and ketones (Ald&Ket), 18 wt% of phenols, and 1 wt% others. Specifically, the FF content was estimated to be 23 wt% from the fresh bio-oil using GC–MS. Additionally, the water content was estimated to be 20 to 30 wt%, which would act as the co-catalyst during the hydrogenation of the bio-oil. The desired amount of bio-oil and 10 mg of the Ru-Pd/BN NC catalyst was mixed under magnetic stirring for 5 min. Then, the catalyst/bio-oil solution mixture was transferred into the stainless-steel autoclave and heated to the desired reaction temperatures between 30 and 150 °C for a reaction time of 1.5 h under 10 bar H2 pressure. After completion of the reaction, the hydrogenated bio-oil and catalyst were separated via centrifugation. Finally, the total FF conversion (%) and FFA yield (%) in the hydrogenated bio-oil were estimated using Eqs. (1) and (3)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Morphological and topological characterization,"3.1 Morphological and topological characterization The monometallic Ru NPRs and bimetallic Ru-Pd NPRs and Ru-Pd/BN NCs were prepared by a microwave-assisted wet co-reduction method using SDS as a surfactant. The Ru clusters were highly self-assembled into Ru NPRs with a hierarchical nanoarchitecture, as schematically depicted in Fig. 1 a: SDS serves as an efficient and flexible soft template for the preparation of the hierarchical monometallic and bimetallic nanoarchitectures for functional applications [39]. Particularly, the critical micelle concentration (CMC) plays a key role in the formation of various morphologies of SDS including spherical, rods, tubes, and vesicles in the aqueous solution, which facilitate the formation of various nanoparticle morphologies [40]. Especially, the spherical-like SDS micelles that are formed at below the CMC (i.e., <1 M SDS) in aqueous solution can be utilized for the straightforward formation of the Ru NPRs. In this synthesis route, spherical-like SDS micelles were formed in the aqueous solution via self-assembly of the individual SDS molecules in the presence of Ru3+ ions. During this interaction, the Ru3+ ions are ionically crosslinked with the spherical-like SDS micelles (Ru3+-SDS), which are converted into metallic Ru0-SDS micelles due to reduction by the NaBH4 solution. Thus, an initially formed Ru0 cluster underwent microwave treatment for 30 s resulting in the formation of Ru nanodots (<3 nm), which further self-assembled into Ru nanospheres (Ru NPRs). This synthesis route results in the rapid formation (within 30 s) of crystalline Ru NPRs combined with Ru nanodots over the SDS micelles. An individual Ru nanodot in the Ru NPRs can amplify the catalytic activity towards the hydrogenation of the bio-oil compared with the Ru-based nanomaterials and bulk materials. The morphological features and crystalline structure of the as-prepared Ru NPRs were systematically studied through SEM and HR-TEM with the SAED pattern. The low magnification SEM image in Fig. 1b clearly shows the formation of spherical-like Ru nanoparticles with an average size of 30 nm. Furthermore, the high-resolution SEM with inset and TEM in Fig. 1c&d, respectively, indicate that the hierarchical Ru NPRs are composed of the self-assembled Ru nanodots with sizes in the nanometer range. Fig. 1e shows the HR-TEM image of the Ru NPRs of sizes in the range of 3–4 nm, which are uniformly assembled to form Ru NPRs under microwave treatment. Moreover, Fig. S1a confirm that the most of the Ru NPRs are formed in the range of 3–4 nm under microwave process. The HR-TEM image in Fig. 1f shows a lattice spacing of 0.229 nm, which agrees with that of the (101) crystal plane of the individual Ru nanodots in the Ru NPRs. Additionally, the SAED pattern of the Ru NPRs shown in Fig. 1g exhibits the crystal planes of (101) and (103) that correspond to the single-crystalline structure of the hexagonal closed-pack (hcp) Ru, confirming the formation of pure Ru NPRs [21,25,33]. The formation of bimetallic Ru-Pd NPRs in an SDS template is schematically depicted in Fig. 2 a. The nanoclusters were formed under microwave irradiation using equal molar concentrations of RuCl3 and PdCl2 (1:1) as precursors and NaBH4 as the reducing agent in an aqueous solution. Originally, Ru3+ and Pd2+ were ionically crosslinked with spherical-like SDS micelles via electrostatic interaction, which initiated the formation of the Ru3+-Pd2+ seeds. These seeds were subsequently reduced to metallic Ru0-Pd0 nuclei, which grow on the spherical-like SDS micelles resulting in the formation of Ru-Pd clusters [28,29,41]. Under microwave irradiation for 30 s, the Ru-Pd clusters undergo a second stage of growth on the SDS micelles, which further self-assemble to form Ru-Pd NPRs. To understand the crystalline structure and morphological evolution of the Ru-Pd NPRs, characterization by SEM and TEM with SAED analysis were performed and the results are depicted in Fig. 2b–g. The low-resolution SEM image in Fig. 2b depicts the successful formation of the Ru-Pd NPRs with average size about 25 nm. The magnified SEM and TEM images in Fig. 2c&d, respectively, show that the Ru-Pd clusters with diameters in the range of 2–3 nm were successfully self-assembled into the hierarchical formation of the Ru-Pd NPRs. Fig. S1b confirms the formation of Ru-Pd NPRs in the range of 2–3 nm. Furthermore, the HR-TEM images in Fig. 2e&f demonstrate the crystalline structure and lattice constant, respectively, for the as-prepared Ru-Pd NPRs. These results reveal the co-existence of the crystalline phases including hcp Ru-Pd and the hcp phase of pure Ru NPs in the Ru-Pd NPRs sample. The lattice constants of the Ru-Pd(111) plane are determined to be: a = 0.21 nm and c = 0.32 nm, whereas those of the Ru(101) plane are determined to be: a = 0.28 nm; c = 0.37 nm, thus indicating the formation of the dual phases of the Ru-Pd and Ru in the Ru-Pd NPRs [28,29]. The SAED pattern of the Ru-Pd NPRs not only confirms the polycrystalline structure with small grains, but also reveals the diffraction peaks of (111) and (200) associated with the hcp crystalline phase of Ru-Pd and those of (101) that correspond to the hcp crystalline phase of pure Ru NPs [42]. Meanwhile, the SDS-assisted Ru-Pd NPRs were grown on 2D BN sheets via a microwave-assisted method with a composition ratio of 1:1:1 in an aqueous solution, as schematically depicted in Fig. 3 a. The as-received BN was homogeneously dispersed in an aqueous solution under sonication for 30 min to form a stable white-colored solution, which can serve as an anchoring site and particle growth platform for the Ru-Pd NPRs. The ionically crosslinked Ru3+-Pd2+-SDS micelles were rapidly converted into Ru0-Pd0 in the presence of morphology directing surfactant by NaBH4. Then, the Ru0-Pd0-SDS micelles were electrostatically adsorbed onto the surfaces of the BN NSs, which undergo the second stage of growth that occurs under a microwave irradiation time for 30 s to form Ru-Pd/BN nanocomposites (Ru-Pd/BN NCs). The HR-TEM image in Fig. 3b shows the exfoliated BN NSs with sizes in the range of 0.5 to 2 μm, consisting of a few tightly packed layers in an orderly manner. The crystallinity, morphology, and composition of the as-prepared Ru-Pd/BN NCs were characterized by SEM with EDS and HR-TEM with SAED pattern. Fig. 3c–e display the SEM images of the typically synthesized Ru-Pd/BN NCs at different magnifications under microwave irradiation. The agglomeration-free homogeneous nanosheet-like Ru-Pd/BN NCs without any individual formation of metal NPs are particularly observed throughout the SEM images, indicating that the Ru-Pd NPRs were completely immobilized on the surfaces of the BN NSs. The inset of Fig. 3f shows the EDS analysis of the Ru-Pd/BN NCs, which consist of B, N, O, C, Ru, and Pd, while no other impurities are observed in the displayed EDS spectrum. The clear TEM image in Fig. 3g indicates that the Ru-Pd NPRs were uniformly dispersed on the surfaces of the BN NSs. The average particle size is observed to be <2 nm based on the HR-TEM image (Fig. 3h&i) as depicted in Fig.S1c, which confirms the formation of tiny Ru-Pd clusters with a periodic array that is typical of the hierarchical Ru-Pd NPRs on the BN NSs. The cluster size distribution for Ru-Pd in the composite sample is relatively narrower than in the Ru-Pd NPRs. Specifically, the BN NSs can control the nucleation growth of the Ru-Pd clusters during the second stage of growth under microwave irradiation. The crystalline structure and phases of the as-prepared Ru-Pd/BN NCs were further determined via the SAED pattern observed in Fig. 3j. Notably, a ring shaped small spots in the SAED pattern is clearly indicating the polycrystalline nature of the samples. The pattern exhibits the diffraction peaks of (111), (200), and (220), which correspond to the hcp Ru-Pd such that the d-spacing of (111) plane is estimated to be: a = 0.1953 nm and c = 0.3021 nm. Meanwhile, the Ru(101) diffraction plane is associated with the hcp crystalline phase of Ru with d-spacing: a = 0.2036 nm and c = 0.3421 nm; similarly, the BN(002) plane corresponds to the h-BN with a d-spacing of 0.34 nm [41,42]. These results clearly indicate the formation of the hcp phases of Ru-Pd and Ru grown on the surfaces of h-BN via microwave irradiation. The crystallographic structures of the Ru NPRs, Ru-Pd NPRs, BN NSs, and Ru-Pd/BN NCs were investigated by XRD analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . The Ru NPRs exhibit broad diffraction peaks at 43.8° and 69.8°, which correspond to the (101) and (110) Miller indices of the Ru0 crystal. The lattice spacing was determined to be 0.2051 nm using the broad diffraction peak of (101), which is consistent with hcp Ru0 crystals (Crystallography Open Database ID: 1539052) [28,43]. The Ru-Pd NPRs displayed major diffraction peaks at 40.8°, 46.2°, and 68.1°, which correspond to the Miller indices of (111), (200), and (220), respectively, and are attributed to hcp Ru0-Pd0, while the noticeable diffraction peak at 43.8° is attributed to the (101) crystal plane of the hcp Ru0 crystal structure [18,20,21,28,43]. Specifically, the XRD pattern of the Ru-Pd NPRs exhibits two distinguished combined crystalline phases of hcp and fcc, where the position of the major diffraction peak (111) of Ru0-Pd0 differs from that of the pure Ru (hcp, 101 at 43.8°) and pure Pd (fcc, 111 at 40.1°). This shift in the main diffraction peak confirms the formation of Pd-Ru alloys instead of the mixed metal oxide phases. Rietveld refinement was used to estimate the lattice constant of the major diffraction peaks for both crystalline phases in the Ru-Pd NPR sample, which were estimated to be: a = 0.2122 nm and c = 0.3221 nm for the hcp Ru-Pd lattice, and a = 0.2847 nm and c = 0.3712 nm for the hcp Ru lattice [42,43]. The hcp lattice constant of the Ru-Pd sample is observed to be higher than that of the pure Pd NPs (a = 0.2724 nm), indicating the incorporation of the fcc Pd metallic state atoms into the hcp lattice during the formation of the Ru-Pd alloy via the microwave method. Furthermore, the XRD pattern of the exfoliated BN NSs shows two diffraction peaks at 25.6° and 42.4° corresponding to the (002) and (100) lattice planes of h-BN, respectively. The lattice constants of the (002) plane in the exfoliated BN NSs were estimated as: a = 0.2421 nm and c = 0.6916 nm, using Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern. The ratio of the crystal cell parameters (c/a) was evaluated as 2.8566, which is higher than the c/a values estimated from the few-layered BN sheets (c/a = 2.6590) and multilayered h-BN (c/a = 2.6580, JCPDS 340421) [30,44–46]. Specifically, the d-spacing of the (002) lattice plane was expanded by ca. 0.12%, owing to the exfoliation of the BN NSs via dispersion through ultrasonication. The characteristic XRD pattern of the Ru-Pd/BN NCs shows three crystalline phases, including the hexagonal crystal structure of BN, hcp Ru0, and hcp Ru0-Pd0. The highly intense diffraction peak at 25.1° corresponds to the (002) crystal plane of h-BN, and the major diffraction peaks at 40.8°, 46.2°, and 68.1° correspond to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of hcp Ru0-Pd0, while the small diffraction peak at 43.8° is attributed to the (101) crystal plane of hcp Ru0. The lattice constant of the (002) BN plane in the Ru-Pd/BN NCs is estimated to be: a = 0.2321 nm and c = 0.6816 nm, and the c/a value is 2.9366, which indicates the formation of a bilayer of the BN NSs [47,48]. As shown in Fig. S2, the (002) plane of Ru-Pd/BN showed a slight downshift to 25.1° than BN NSs (25.6°) with decreased peak intensity due to loading of the Ru-Pd NPRs. Also, the uniform dispersion of Ru-Pd NPRs prevented the agglomeration of the individual BN NSs which ensured their higher specific surface area. Furthermore, the lattice constant of the (111) plane is estimated to be: a = 0.1953 nm and b = 0.3021 nm for the hcp lattice in the Ru0-Pd0, and the lattice constants of the (101) plane are evaluated as: a = 0.2036 nm and b = 0.3421 nm for the hcp lattice in the Ru0 [17,20,21,28,29,42]. The decrease in the lattice constant of Ru-Pd/BN NCs compared to pure Ru-Pd NPRs is due to the formation of the smaller crystalline sizes of Ru-Pd on the surfaces of the BN NSs. Furthermore, the average crystal sizes of the Ru-Pd NPRs and Ru-Pd/BN NCs were estimated to be 3 and 2.8 nm, respectively, using the Scherrer equation, which is consistent with the HR-TEM results. These results clearly reveal the formation of smaller crystallite sizes of Ru-Pd bimetallic alloyed NPs on the surfaces of the BN NSs. This is because the BN NSs suppressed the aggregation of the Ru-Pd nuclei during the alloy formation, resulting in decreased crystalline sizes of the Ru-Pd on the surfaces of BN NSs. Hence, controlling the sizes of Ru-Pd bimetallic NPs on the BN NSs at the atomic level can efficiently tune the catalytic activity towards the hydrogenation of the bio-oil compounds. The chemical nature and composition of the Ru NPRs and Ru-Pd/BN NCs were characterized by XPS analysis, as shown in Fig. 5 a. The survey scan of the Ru NPRs showed noticeable high intense peaks of Ru 4p, Ru 3d + C1s, Ru 3p, and O1s, which indicates the formation of the pure metallic state of the Ru NPs. Additionally, the survey scan of Ru-Pd/BN shows obvious peaks at Ru 4p, B1s, Ru 3d + C1s, Ru 3d, Pd 3d, N1s, Ru 3p, and O1s associated with the formation of the ternary elements of Ru, Pd, and BN in the sample. Fig. 5b shows the deconvolution of Ru 3d spectrum of Ru NPRs and Ru-Pd/BN NCs into two distinguished spin–orbit split peaks namely Ru 3d3/2 and Ru 3d5/2 with an energy gap of 4.9 eV [49]. Especially, the deconvoluted Ru 3d spectra in the Ru NPR sample show the metallic state peaks of Ru0 3d5/2 and Ru0 3d3/2 at binding energy values of 281.8 and 286.1 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, the deconvoluted RuO2 3d5/2 peak is observed at the binding energy of 283.8 eV, which indicates surface oxidation, and the C1s (C–C) is observed at the binding energy of 286.9 eV. This is consistent with the presence of the surfactant (SDS) in the Ru NPR sample. On the other hand, the Ru-Pd/BN NC sample shows a negative shift in the deconvoluted metallic/oxide state peaks with an energy gap of 4.1 eV. Especially, the binding energies of Ru0 3d5/2 and Ru0 3d3/2 for the Ru-Pd/BN NCs sample shows a negative shift of 1.1 eV compared with that of the pure Ru NPRs sample [17,18,20,21]. These results clearly confirm the formation of Ru-Pd bimetallic alloyed NPs on the surfaces of the BN NSs, which would promote the hydrogenation of the bio-oil compounds. Furthermore, the Pd 3d spectra in the Ru-Pd/BN NC sample are deconvoluted into two spin–orbit split peaks of 3d3/2 and Pd 3d5/2 with an energy gap of 5.5 eV, as shown in Fig. 5c. The deconvoluted peaks of Pd0 3d3/2 and Pd0 3d5/2 are attributed to the binding energies of 341.9 and 336.4 eV, respectively, which are associated with the metallic states of Pd0 in the Ru-Pd/BN NCs sample. Meanwhile, the less-intense doublet deconvoluted peaks of Pd2+ 3d3/2 and Pd2+ 3d5/2 located at 342.57 and 336.94 eV can be attributed to the oxidation state of the Pd atoms on the surface of the Ru-Pd/BN NC sample [20]. The atomic ratio of Pd0:Pd2+ was estimated to be 0.4 using the deconvoluted Pd 3d spectra, as depicted in Fig. 5c. Notably, the Ru-Pd/BN NC sample shows positively shifted deconvoluted peaks of Pd0 3d3/2 and Pd0 3d5/2 compared with those of the pure Pd NPs (Pd2+ 3d3/2 at 340.9 eV; and Pd2+ 3d5/2 at 335.7 eV) because of the charge transfer between Ru and Pd after the formation of the Ru-Pd bimetallic alloyed NPs on the surfaces of the BN NSs [50]. Fig. 5d shows the deconvoluted XPS spectra of B1s, which exhibits two peaks, namely, B-N at 190.2 eV, related to the h-BN structure, and B-O at 197.6 eV that is associated with the oxygenated elements. The XPS spectra of N1s are deconvoluted into two peaks, including N-B and N–H bonds at the binding energies of 397.7 eV and 398.6 eV as depicted in Fig. 5e. The noticeable deconvoluted peaks of B−O at 197.6 eV and N−O at 398.6 eV might be due to the exposure of the Ru-Pd/BN NC sample to the atmosphere before the XPS analysis [45,46]. Furthermore, the deconvoluted O1s spectra in Fig. 5f shows three intense peaks including O-Ru at 529.7 eV due to the oxidation of the Ru surface atoms, O-Pd at 531.2 due to the oxidation of the Pd surface atoms, and O-B at 533.7 eV due to the oxygenated species on the surfaces of the BN NSs [46]. Hence, adding Ru metallic atoms to Pd can change the electronic structures of the Ru-Pd bimetallic alloy and thus, the as-prepared Ru-Pd / BN NCs can exhibit enhanced catalytic activity toward the hydrogenation of bio-oil compounds. Furthermore, Fig. S3 shows the surface area and pore size distribution of the Ru-Pd/BN sample. Specifically, homogeneous distribution of the Ru-Pd particles on the surface of BN NSs tend to exhibit the IUPAC type II isotherm which indicated the existence of mesopores on the catalyst structure [47]. The Brunauer − Emmett − Teller (BET) analysis showed that the Ru-Pd/BN sample shows a higher surface area of 320 m2 g−1 than bulk BN. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) analysis was used to estimate the pore size distribution of the Ru-Pd/BN nanocomposites using adsorption branch of the isotherms. The inset Fig. S1 shows the pore size distribution curve with a single high intensity peak around 1 to 2 nm which revealed that the Ru-Pd/BN nanocomposites was dominantly composed of mesopores structure."
9,Catalytic conversion,"3.2 Catalytic conversion Furfural is used as a model bio-oil component to examine the catalytic activities of the as-prepared Ru NPRs, Ru-Pd NPRs, and Ru-Pd/BN NCs. The hydrogenation of furfural (FF) to selectively produce furfuryl alcohol (FFA) was initially studied over the different catalysts at 150 °C for 1.5 h under 10 bar H2 pressure using water as solvent. According to earlier studies, a plausible reaction pathway for FF conversion over the catalyst can be described as shown in Fig. 6 a: FF is hydrogenated into FFA, tetrahydrofurfural (THFF), and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFFA) over the various catalysts in the presence of water as a co-catalyst [17,20,50,51]. As shown in Fig. 6b, the control experiment (i.e., without catalyst) shows 0.5% of FF conversion with a negligible amount of product yield. The Ru NPR catalyst showed a 62% conversion of the reactant with 56% FFA yield owing to the greater availability of metallic catalytic sites on the catalyst surface. In contrast, the Ru-Pd NPR catalyst exhibits an improved performance with 69.5% FFA yield and 78% FF conversion under mild reaction conditions. As expected, the addition of Pd into the Ru NPR is observed to be favorable for the adsorption of FF via the C=O oxygen moiety, resulting in enhanced FF conversion efficiency and FFA yield [52]. Furthermore, the Ru-Pd/BN NC catalyst exhibited superior catalytic activity with 98.2% FFA yield and 100% FF conversion under mild reaction conditions due to higher surface area and larger availability of active metallic catalytic sites [30,44,45,53]. Particularly, the BN NSs in the NCs provided not only the anchoring sites for the adsorption of FF but also a dispersion platform for the Ru-Pd NPRs, which brings the FF close to the catalyst sites, thereby promoting the selective hydrogenation of C=O, rather than the furanyl ring. The zeta potential analysis in Fig. S4 suggest that the FF was efficiently adsorbed on the surfaces of BN NSs and Ru-Pd/BN NCs, which was then successfully converted into FFA and other byproducts over the metallic surfaces of Ru-Pd catalytic sites. The catalytic potential of the hybrid Ru-Pd/BN catalyst for the hydrogenation of FF was explored at various reaction times (0.5 to 3.0 h) and various temperatures (50 to 300 °C) as depicted in Fig. 6c&d. The FF conversion increases in the Ru-Pd/BN based catalytic system when the reaction time is increased from 0.5 to 1.5 h at a fixed reaction temperature of 150 °C under 10 bar H2 pressure. As shown in Fig. 6c, when the hydrogenation of the FF reaction is examined at 0.5 h, 46% FF conversion with 94% FFA yield, 1% THFFA yield, 4% THFF yield, and 1% other byproducts are achieved. However, the FF conversion efficiency increases up to 100% with the FFA yield increase to 98% and 2% THFFA yield when the reaction time is increased to 1.5 h. This indicates that most of the carbonyl (−C=O) group of the FF was efficiently hydrogenated to form FFA over the surface of the Ru-Pd/BN nanocatalyst at 1.5 h reaction time. Thus, the smaller crystallite sizes of Ru-Pd NPRs on the BN sheets could significantly provide active catalytic sites with increased electron density, promoting the hydrogenation of FF to FFA under mild reaction conditions. However, a further increase in the reaction time, i.e., between 2 and 3 h causes a decrease in the FFA yield; this indicates that 1.5 h reaction time is most suitable for obtaining a high FFA yield. However, 100% FF conversion with 35% FFA, 2% THFF, 32% THFFA yields along with 31% yield of other side-reaction products such as 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone (4-H 2-CPN), 2-cyclopentenone (2-CPN), and cyclopentanone (CPN) is observed at a longer reaction time of 3 h; this describes the hydrogenation of FFA to obtain THFFA, and hydrogenation of furanyl ring to the final product of CPN [54]. This indicates that a longer reaction time could result in the formation of various mixed products over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst for the hydrogenation reactions involving the carbonyl (−C=O) group of FF as well the furanyl ring [55]. To further clear the role of Ru-Pd catalytic sites on the BN NSs, turnover frequency (TOF) values are estimated based on the active Ru0 and Pd0 sites. The Ru and Ru-Pd NPRs based catalysts exhibited the TOF values of 27 and 56 h−1, respectively for the conversion of FF into FFA, as summarized in supplementary Table 1. Furthermore, the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst showed the higher TOF value of 270 h−1 than the TOF values of Ru and Pd-Ru catalysts which indicated the possible higher catalytic activity of Ru-Pd/BN NC for the conversion of FF into FFA. Moreover, the influence of the reaction temperature on the yields of FFA and other side-reaction products from the hydrogenation of FF over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst was also investigated in the temperature range of 50–300 °C, and the results are depicted in Fig. 6d. The reaction temperature is observed to have a significant influence on both FF conversion efficiency and yield of FFA and other side-reaction products: As the reaction temperature rises from 50 to 150 °C, the FF conversion efficiency increases from 48% to 100% and the FFA yield increases from 93% to 99%, respectively, indicating that increase in temperatures promote the hydrogenation of the carbonyl (−C=O) group of FF over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst. However, as the reaction temperature is further increased from 200 to 300 °C, the FFA yield decreases from 98% to 17%, respectively, while the production of the other side-reaction products including THFFA, 4-H 2-CPN, 2-CPN, and CPN increases. The observed higher yield of the other side-reaction products at 300 °C is due to the further hydrogenation of THFFA followed by the rearrangement of the furan ring, which in turn results in the formation of the CPN-based byproducts at this temperature [56]. Therefore, the results of this investigation lead to the conclusion that the hydrogenation of FF and the formation of reactant products can be mainly tuned by varying the reaction temperature and time. Specifically, a higher FFA yield (99%) was achieved at of 150 °C and 1.5 h under 10 bar H2 pressure over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst in water as the reaction medium. The reaction medium also plays a crucial role in the hydrogenation of FF and formation of the products. In the hydrogenation reaction, water acts as a co-catalyst and can significantly influence the conversion of FF into the selective formation of FFA [57]. Moreover, water-mediated protonation can efficiently influence the FF conversion over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst. This is because the strong interaction between the water molecules and surfaces of the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst causes the dissociation of water molecules into H+ and OH– species. The produced H+ is transferred from the catalyst surface onto a carbonyl group (CO) resulting in a H-assisted CO cleavage [35]. Further studies were performed to investigate the effect of solvents on the hydrogenation of FF over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst into selective production of FFA and other byproducts under mild reaction conditions. Various solvents were used as the reaction medium or co-catalyst for the hydrogenation of FF. Fig. 7 shows the FF conversion and product yields achieved using four different solvents, namely water, 2-propanol, toluene, and cyclohexane. Distinctly, water-mediated protic polar solvent afforded 98.5% FFA yield with 99% FF conversion via selective hydrogenation of C=O over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst along with the formation of negligible amounts of THFF and THFFA. Moreover, the FF conversion efficiency (99%) is higher in the water-mediated solvent than in 2-propanol (78%), toluene (82%), and cyclohexane (88%) solvents. The solvent-dependent reaction pathways are clearly depicted in Fig. 7: THFF is the main product in toluene- and cyclohexane-mediated reactions, which is because the hydrogenation of the furanyl ring is preferred over the catalyst, leading to the formation of other byproducts including 2-methylfuran (MeF) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran [24]. The use of non-protic polar solvents such as toluene, and cyclohexane facilitated the hydrogenation of the ring resulting in decreased FFA yield and increased the yield of the byproducts namely 2-MF and 2-MTHF. Moreover, the protic 2-propanol led to the formation of furan via the decarbonylation of FF while the secondary hydrogenation of furan resulted in the formation of THF over the surfaces of the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst. These results demonstrate the role of the solvents towards tuning the yield of the reaction products. Conclusively, the water-mediated reaction produces a higher FFA yield at 150 °C for 1.5 h via hydrogenation of carbonyl (−C=O) group of FF, while at higher reaction temperatures (>250 °C) and longer reaction times (>3h) the hydrogenation leads to the furan ring rearrangement, which facilitates the formation of CPN over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst. Furthermore, the yield of 2-CPN and CPN-based products was tuned by varying the reaction temperatures in the range of 250 to 400 °C and at longer reaction times between 3 and 7 h over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst using water as a reaction medium under 10 bar partial H2 pressure. Fig. 8 shows the plausible reaction pathways, FF conversion (%), and the resultant product yield (%) at various reaction temperatures and longer reaction times over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst. The major byproducts namely FFA, THFFA, THFF, 4-H 2-CPN, 2-CPN, and CPN are obtained at reaction temperatures above 250 °C and reaction times longer than 3 h. Fig. 8a shows the temperature-dependent FF conversion with product yields at reaction temperatures in the range of 250–400 °C at 4 h reaction time. Initially, the CPN yield increases from 5% at 250 °C to 52% at 350 °C while the respective FFA yield decreases from 31% to 3%, suggesting that higher temperatures accelerate the ring rearrangement reaction [58]. During the entire temperature-dependent investigation, an increase in the yield of the byproducts 4-H 2-CPN and 2-CPN is observed, which are further transformed into CPN via a secondary hydrogenation reaction. The Ru-Pd/BN catalyst recorded a maximum CPN yield of 52% and 2-CPN yield of 30% at 350 °C for 4 h reaction time under 10 bar H2 pressure using water as the reaction medium. However, a further increase in the hydrogenation temperature to 400 °C did not improve the yields of CPN and 2-CPN, as the reaction was performed above the critical temperature of the water thus increasing the reactor pressure. Therefore, the effect of the reaction time on the hydrogenation of FF and yields of CPN and 2-CPN was also examined at the optimum reaction temperature of 350 °C. As shown in Fig. 8b, the CPN yield rapidly increases as the reaction time is extended from 3 to 6 h, and achieves a maximum yield of 21% and 31% for 2-CPN and CPN, respectively. The yield of 2-CPN and CPN continues stably when the reaction time is increased from 6 to 7 h. Eventually, the yields of FFA, 4-H 2-CPN, and 2-CPN are observed to decrease with increasing reaction time until these intermediate products undergo hydrogenation to form CPN. Therefore, the maximum CPN yield (68%) is obtained at 7 h over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst at 350 °C using water as a reaction medium. A reaction pathway for the conversion of FF and that of FFA into CPN has been schematically depicted in Fig. 8 based on the experimental studies and the previous work described elsewhere [14,20]. The higher catalytic activity of Ru-Pd/BN was attributed to the metallic active sites of the Ru-Pd and mild acidic sites of the few layered BN NSs. Importantly, BN NSs aided in uniform dispersion of the metallic catalytic sites of the Ru-Pd and also served as the acidic sites for the hydrolytic reactions. The BN NSs efficiently adsorbed FF, bringing it closer to the active catalytic species of Ru0 and Pd0 (111), thus promoting the hydrogenation of the FFA via a hydrogen transfer from the adjacent Ru/Pd-H active catalytic sites. Further, the FFA undergoes furan ring rearrangement to form 4-H, 2-CPN in water over the acidic sites of the BN NSs. Subsequently, 4-H 2-CPN is converted into 2-CPN via protonation and rearrangement over the acid sites of the BN and finally, 2-CPN is transformed into CPN [59]. Especially, Ru0 and Pd0 (111) metal sites were efficiently involved in the hydrogenation process, whereas a mild acid sites of the BN catalyst was effectively involved in the reaction of water addition and hydrolytic ring opening thus enhancing the yield of the CPN [20]. Thus, the tunable hydrogenation process for the conversion of FF into FFA, 2-CPN, and CPN has been demonstrated over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst in water as a reaction medium [23]. Thus, the as-prepared Ru-Pd/BN catalyst exhibited better catalytic performance than the BN NSs, as-prepared Ru NPRs, and Ru-Pd NPRs catalysts. To provide further sustainable and practical applications for the as-prepared Ru-Pd/BN nanocatalyst, date-tree waste-derived bio-oil (DTM bio-oil) was used as a real sample for the hydrogenation experiments, as schematically depicted in Fig. 9 a. Our previous studies reported that high-quality DTM bio-oil was produced under the optimized pyrolysis conditions of 500 °C for 30 min at a flow rate of 10 mL min−1 [3,60]. As shown in Fig. 9b, a variety of cyclic organic, straight-chain, saturated, and unsaturated compounds, namely acids (46 wt%), aldehydes and ketones (Ald&Ket, 35 wt%), phenols (18 wt%), and others (1,7-diaminoheptane and etc., 1.0 wt%), were identified in the oil composition [3]. Especially, FF and moisture content were estimated to be 23 wt% and 20 to 30 wt% respectively, in the freshly prepared DTM bio-oil, which underwent the temperature-dependent hydrogenation reaction [61]. Fig. 9c shows the FF conversion and the product yield at reaction temperatures in the range of 50 to 250 °C for 1.5 h under 10 bar H2 pressure. When the hydrogenation reaction was carried out at 50 °C, 49% FF conversion was achieved along with a yield of 40% FFA, 5% THFFA, 1% CPN, and 2% other byproducts. As the temperature is increased from 100 to 150 °C, the FF conversion increases from 83% to 97% and the FFA yield from 59% to 71%, respectively. However, as the reaction temperature is further increased to 250 °C, the FFA yield slightly decreases to 63%, while the CPN yield increases to 20%. A higher reaction temperature facilitates the formation of CPN via a furan ring rearrangement reaction leading to the transformation of FFA into 2-CPN, followed by its hydrogenation. Thus, the as-prepared Ru-Pd/BN catalyst exhibits better catalytic performance for the upgradation of real bio-oil samples under mild reaction conditions. These results show that the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst is a highly active catalyst for the conversion of freshly produced bio-oil with tunable production of FFA, 2-CPN, and CPN towards biofuel production. Despite the promising hydrogenation results, the stability and recyclability of the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst are the key determiners of its industrial practical applications. Recycle studies of the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst were further conducted by determining the FF conversion and FFA yield at 150 °C for 1.5 h under 10 bar H2 pressure using water as the reaction medium. A series of five consecutive runs were conducted for testing the recyclability of the catalyst and after each run, the used catalyst was separated by centrifugation and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 100 °C. As shown in Fig. 10 a, the first three runs achieved 100% FF conversion and 98% FFA yield over the used Ru-Pd/BN catalyst under the same hydrogenation conditions. Thereafter however, a slight decrease in the FF conversion (98%) and FFA yield (96%) is observed, indicating slight catalyst deactivation due to coke formation or the slight oxidation that occurs on its surface. Additionally, the spent catalyst was collected from the fifth run to investigate its physicochemical properties using SEM with EDS and X-ray diffraction analyses. Fig. 10b&c show the SEM micrographs and EDS spectra of the used Ru-Pd/BN catalyst, respectively. The highly magnified inset Fig. 10b shows the uniform dispersion of individual BN NSs with homogeneous dispersion of Ru-Pd nanoparticles. The EDS spectra in Fig. 10c show the elemental composition of the spent Ru-Pd/BN catalyst, indicating the presence of the elements B, N, C, O, Ru, and Pd, while no other impurities were observed. Moreover, the atomic weight percentages of C and O are higher in the spent Ru-Pd/BN catalyst than in the as-prepared Ru-Pd/BN (Fig. 3f), which was due to the adsorbed bio-oil compounds on the surfaces of the spent catalyst. The HR-TEM images in Fig. 10d&e showed that the morphology of the spent Ru-Pd/BN catalyst and the particles sizes remains unchanged, which established the intact structure of the Ru-Pd NPRs on the BN NSs after the hydrogenation reactions. The structural study of Ru-Pd/BN in Fig. 10f shows a diffraction peak of 002 at 26.5°, which corresponds to the h-BN while the other diffraction peaks of 111, 200, and 220 are observed at 40.5°, 46.3° and 68.5°, respectively, which are attributed to the fcc Ru-Pd bimetallic alloy [28,41,50]. Moreover, the spent Ru-Pd/BN catalyst does not exhibit any structural changes with respect to the as-prepared Ru-Pd/BN sample (Fig. 4), suggesting that the hydrogenation experiment does not alter the crystalline structure of the composite. Thus, the straightforward rapid synthesis method used herein results in superior catalytic performance for the conversion of bio-oil compounds into tunable targeted products. Therefore, coupled with their reusable properties, the Ru-Pd/BN NCs are a suitable replacement for the low-performance transition-metal based catalysts for bio-oil upgradation, specifically for FF conversion to wide range of desirable products. Hence, the as-prepared Ru-Pd/BN NC based catalyst has good potential for use in industrial applications."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, we have established an efficient technique to synthesize alloyed Ru-Pd NCs of self-assembled Ru-Pd/BN nanocatalysts via microwave irradiation for 30 s. In this synthesis process, SDS micelles were used as a template, which leads to the formation of spherical-like Ru-Pd, which combine with the self-assembled Ru-Pd clusters. The HR-TEM analysis of the Ru-Pd/BN NCs confirmed the formation of 1.5 to 2 nm tiny Ru-Pd clusters with a periodic array typical of hierarchical Ru-Pd NPRs on the BN NSs. The XRD and XPS analyses of the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst clearly established the successful formation of the alloyed bimetallic system over the surfaces of the BN NSs. Additionally, systematic formation mechanisms were effectively proven for the rapid synthesis of monometallic, bimetallic, and hybrid NCs. The bimetallic catalytic sites in the Ru-Pd/BN catalysts exhibited greater catalytic activity than the pure Ru and Ru-Pd-only catalytic sites for FF hydrogenation under mild reaction conditions. Specifically, 98.2% yield of FFA was achieved at 100% FF conversion over the Ru-Pd/BN catalysts at 150 °C for 1.5 h using water as a reaction medium under 10 bar H2 pressure. The hydrogenation of FF was further explored to investigate the effect of various solvents over the Ru-Pd/BN catalysts. The results showed that the protic 2-propanol leads to the formation of furan via the decarbonylation of FF while secondary hydrogenation of furan leads to the formation of THF over the surfaces of the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst. The results of this detailed investigation suggest that the reaction solvents play a vital role in tuning the desired products and yield of the targeted products. Furthermore, a higher reaction temperature and time leads to a higher CPN yield: 68% was achieved at 350 °C for 4 h over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst using water as a reaction medium. Thus, the tunable hydrogenation process for the conversion of FF into the desired products has been successfully demonstrated over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst in various solvents. To investigate real-time applications, date-tree biomass-derived bio-oil was used as a real sample for upgrading over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst. The results showed that the developed Ru-Pd/BN catalyst is a recyclable and highly active candidate for the conversion of freshly produced bio-oil with tunable production, which makes it suitable for industrial applications."
