0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has attracted great attention since the energy crisis in 1970s. Because it has a three times higher caloric value than petroleum and does not emit carbon dioxide or NO x , it is considered one of the most promising alternatives to fossil fuels [1]. Hydrogen may be produced through naphtha thermal-cracking or water electrolysis, which require much energy and emit global warming gases such as carbon dioxide. As the concerns over the environment are growing, green process for hydrogen production are widely studied [1]. Anaerobic bioprocess for hydrogen production may be a reliable option. The anaerobic fermentation process is composed of two steps, acidogenic and methanogenic. The main products in the acidogenic step are volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and hydrogen gas while methane is produced in the methanogenic step. The optimal conditions for each step are different in terms of the types and interactions of microorganisms and optimal pH. Therefore, in order to produce hydrogen gas efficiently, it is crucial to maintain fermentation condition suitable not for VFAs but for hydrogen gas in the acidogenic step. The major factors affecting hydrogen production are pH [2,3] and hydraulic retention time (HRT) [4]. Because hydrogen producing microorganisms are inhibited at low pH, the pH value should be above 4.0 [5]. With respect to HRT, hydrogen gas and VFAs are mainly produced under short HRT condition while by-products such as ethanol and lactate are produced under long HRT conditions [6]. Although pure cultures such as Enterbacter aerogens [3], Clostridium butyricum [7] and Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08 [8] have been used to produce hydrogen gas using organic materials as energy sources, mixed cultures were also reported to produce hydrogen gas through pH control [2,3], HRT control [4] or killing methanogenic bacteria in the early fermentation stage [9]. In this study, a mixed culture of sewage digester sludge was used for hydrogen gas production. In order to eliminate methanogenic bacteria and make fermentation condition suitable for hydrogen production, pH was controlled. Although the sludge spontaneously formed granules in a UASB reactor, sludge loss was serious and sometimes no microorganisms remained in the UASB during the start-up operation. Therefore, two immobilization methods, biofilm formation and granulation of the sludge, were suggested for the protection of sludge loss and the maintenance of harbouring many cells in the reactor. Hydrogen production in the two methods was also compared."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Sludge and synthetic wastewater,"2.1 Sludge and synthetic wastewater A mixed culture was obtained from sewage digester sludge from the city of Daejeon in Korea. The solid concentration and ash content were around 42,750mg/L and 20%, respectively. Synthetic wastewater was formulated as shown in Table 1 . Glucose of 20g/L was a main carbon source and the COD:N:P ratio was 100:2.5:0.5."
3,Reactor configuration,"2.2 Reactor configuration The reactor system for the anaerobic hydrogen production is shown in Fig. 2 . Agitation speed and operating temperature was 60rpm and 37°C, respectively."
4,Characteristics of medium for biofilm formation,"2.3 Characteristics of medium for biofilm formation Poly vinyl alcohol (PVA), a hydrophilic medium, occupied 20% working volume of the reactor and its characteristics were summarized in Table 2 ."
5,Granulation method,"2.4 Granulation method Sludge itself has a negative charge of −26mV. In order to make the sludge neutral, high molecular weight cationic polymer (cationic polyacrylamide, M.W.: 15,000,000) of 0.7% (w/w) of dry sewage digester sludge was added to the sludge and stirred at 200rpm for 2min. Since residual cation may cause detrimental effect on the microorganisms, anionic organic materials (anionic silica sol) of 0.7% (w/w) of dry sewage digester sludge were added and stirred at 200rpm for 2min. The total time required for the granulation, was therefore about 5min. The schematic procedure was shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1(a) shows the state of initial sludge where filamentous and flock forming microorganisms coexisted. Fig. 1(b) shows the initial flock after adding cationic polymer to the sludge. The flock was soon disintegrated by the shear force from a mixer and a large portion of cationic polymer not involved in the flock formation remained on the surface of microorganisms as shown in Fig. 1(c). The microorganisms were reflocked by the addition of colloidal silica. The colloidal silica penetrated into the flock and neutralized the excess positive charge of the cationic polymer, resulting in the formation of compact flock as shown in Fig. 1(d) [10]."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The effluent from the reactor was taken every 48h to analyze pH, VFAs, CODcr, mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and residual glucose. pH was measured using a portable pH meter (Orion, model 520A, USA). VFAs samples were filtered using a 0.2μm filter and then analyzed using a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC, Shodex RI-71, Japan) equipped with an organic acid analysis column. CODcr and MLSS was measured according to standard methods. Residual glucose was colorimetrically measured using an enzyme kit (Glucose assay kit, Sigma, USA). The amount of biogas produced by the microorganisms was measured with a water displacement method [8] and the composition of the biogas analyzed using a gas chromatography (GC, DS 6200) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a HayesepQ column (80/100 mesh). The operating temperature of the GC was 25°C for the oven, 120°C for the detector and 90°C for the injector. Argon was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 30ml/min. The PVA medium with biofilm was firstly lyophilized and the biofilm removed and observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL JSM-840A, The Netherlands). The cross-section of the granular sludge was prepared using a cryotome (MICRON, Germany) and observed at 200 magnification with a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) (Bio-Rad, UK)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Reactor operation with biofilm on PVA,"3.1 Reactor operation with biofilm on PVA Hydrogen gas was continuously produced under anaerobic condition by the biofilm of hydrogen-production microorganisms formed on the surface of hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol. The activity of methanogenic bacteria was repressed by adjusting the pH to 5.0 ± 0.1. Fig. 3 shows the profiles of biogas production rate, the concentrations of VFAs, and the contents of hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide in the biogas during reactor operation. When the degree of glucose consumption was over 90% and maintained stabely, a pseudo-steady state was assumed and the HRT was decreased stepwise as shown in Fig. 3(a). The biogas production rate was relatively low in the early operation stage but gradually increased to reach a maximum value of 200mL/L-reactor/h after 13 days of operation when the total VFAs concentration was a minimum. Low concentrations of VFAs implied that the acidogenic bacteria were repressed and that hydrogen production bacteria were predominant. However, hydrogen gas bubbles began to penetrate into the PVA pores to float PVA media at the maximum hydrogen production stage. The poor contact between microorganisms and substrate inside the medium decreased the hydrogen production rate to about 100mL/L-reactor/h the next day. Concentration changes of VFAs and by-products during the acid production stage may be an indicator of the fermentation state. It was reported that the increase in partial pressure of hydrogen gas in the head space of the reactor repressed hydrogen production by acidogenic bacteria. This is referred to as product inhibition and stimulated the accumulation of propionic acid, which changed the characteristics of fermentation. However, since the propionic acid producing bacteria were either washed out or inhibited at pH 5 [11], propionic acid was not accumulated in the early operation stage as shown in Fig. 3(b). The pH was adjusted to 5.0 by feeding alkali solution, KOH. However, the abrupt accumulation of propionic acid was observed and biogas production was noticeably decreased after 20 days of operation as shown in Fig. 3(a). The reason was thought to be that, in the case of PVA media, the pH value inside PVA pores where a good portion of the microorganisms attached may be transiently different from the value in the broth due to mass transfer limitation and an increased hydrogen partial pressure in the pores could cause the accumulation of propionic acid [11]. The results also showed that the high accumulation of propionic acid with other fatty acids caused severe inhibition of hydrogen production microorganisms and that their activities were not recovered even after the accumulation was decreased [12]. The content of hydrogen gas in the biogas ranged from 40 to 60% during operation. Because methanogenic bacteria was severely inhibited and washed out by adjusting pH to 5.0, no methane gas was produced throughout the operation. Hydrogen production by acidogenic microorganism was triggered by accepting extra electrons during the production of acetic and butyric acid, as chemical Eqs. (1) and (2) show. Also, the anaerobic bacteria are known to play a key role in the fermentation of acetic acid and butyric acid [9]. (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 C H 3 COOH + 2 C O 2 + 4 H 2 (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 → C H 3 C H 2 C H 2 COOH + 2 C O 2 + 2 H 2 The microorganisms attached to the PVA media were observed using a SEM at 4000 magnifications as shown in Fig. 4 . Since the pH was fixed at 5.0 during operation and the PVA media was taken at maximum hydrogen production rate, the microorganisms were believed to be hydrogen producing bacteria. The appearance of the microorganisms was like noodles and they were connected to each other in a complex network."
9,Reactor operation with granular sludge,"3.2 Reactor operation with granular sludge Microorganisms tend to form flocks, irrespective of anaerobes or aerobes. Although the mechanism of granulation is not fully revealed, it is generally accepted that extra polymers excreted by microorganisms and the charge of sludge play a major role in the flocculation of microorganisms. In this study, granular sludge was made through electric neutralization and cross-linking by adding cationic and anionic polymers sequentially. As shown in Fig. 5 , granular sludge made in this study had a similar shape to that of granular sludge of a normal UASB reactor. By adding cationic polymer (cationic polyacrylamide) and anionic polymer (silica sol) the granular sludge was formed within 5min. In addition, the granular shape was maintained stabely and its size ranged from 1.0 to 3.0mm. Since granular sludge was denser than sewage digester sludge itself and biofilm on PVA medium as shown by falling velocity experiments (Table 3 ), sludge loss owing to floatation can be significantly prevented and efficient continuous hydrogen production may be possible. Colour change in the culture broth was observed during operation. The black colour, typical in an anaerobic process, changed to grey after 15 days of operation and this colour was maintained thereafter. The colour change was thought to be due to the characteristics of the microorganisms adapted to the hydrogen production condition and the microorganisms predominating in the reactor [13]. Also, while the HS− ion produced by sulphidogenic bacteria, known to be the main hydrogen production bacteria, combines with metal ions such as ferrous ion, taking on a dark colour, at pH 6.0 or higher, the sulphide ion exists in the form of H2S at pH 5.0 and cannot combine with the metal ions, which made the broth colour change to grey [2]. Fig. 6 shows the changes of biogas production rate, VFA concentrations and biogas composition. The HRT decreased stepwise after confirming the degree of glucose consumption was over 90%. In the early operation stage, the accumulation of intermediates such as acetic and butyric acid was severe and biogas production was negligible at this stage. However, as the total amount of VFAs in the reactor decreased, biogas production increased dramatically from 20ml/L-reactor/h to the maximum of 380ml/L-reactor/h. Although butyric acid, the main fermentation product, was as high as 3000mg/L at 35 days of operation, it did not affect biogas production as shown in Fig. 6(b). On the contrary, propionic acid was rarely accumulated. Considering the results from both immobilization methods, it can be said that propionic acid among VFAs caused the most severe inhibition effect on the hydrogen producing microorganisms. This has been reported by other researchers [12]. The level of hydrogen production by the consumption of glucose can be given as the ratio of butyric acid to acetic acid [9]. The ratio for C. butyricum is around 2.1 and that for Butyribacterium methylotrophicum is 0.75 [14]. The ratio of 3.42 in this study implied that the hydrogen gas production system with granular sludge was better than the pure culture systems above frequently cited as references. It was observed that this reactor system using granular sludge produced much more biogas for a longer time than the reactor system with microorganisms attached to the PVA (circa, 300ml/L-reactor/h versus 50ml/L-reactor/h) as shown in Fig. 6(a). The reason was that granular sludge had a higher density than PVA with biofilm as mentioned above. Moreover, the granular sludge harboured more microorganisms than PVA with biofilm (approximately, 7000mg/L-reactor versus 4000mg/L-reactor). The content of hydrogen gas in the biogas was around 50% and no methane was produced throughout the operation, which does not necessary mean no methanogenic bacteria exist in the granules. Since methanogenic bacteria are known to produce natural fluorescent materials, the granules were taken at the end of operation and observed using a CLSM. In the granules whose diameter was in the range of 1.5–2.0mm, no fluorescent materials were found (data now shown). Accordingly, it can be said that the methanogenic microorganisms were absent while hydrogen production microorganisms were prevalent inside granules. In this study, it was shown that a mixed culture was able to produce hydrogen gas efficiently using pH control and granular sludge showed much better performance in hydrogen gas production than a biofilm on PVA. For a better understanding of hydrogen gas production using microorganisms-compacted granules, mass transfer and pH change inside the granule should be comprehensively understood. These topics will be considered in future studies."
