0,Introduction,"As known, 90% of current processes in world chemical industry are heterogeneously catalyzed reactions [1]. Heterogeneous catalysis plays a crucial role in solving actual problems offering a cost-effective response to multiple economic and environmental challenges. Thus, intensively developing new and original heterogeneous catalytic systems undoubtedly is an imperative of our time. At the same time, new catalytic opportunities could be found through identifying new application niches for known catalysts in those chemical processes, which are unconventional for these catalysts. The interesting and promising catalysts which permanently demonstrate a high potential and ability for such “application updating” are Raney metals. In general, these are a very popular family of metal sponges (for example, monometallic cobalt [2,3], copper [4,5], iron [2,6], ruthenium [7], platinum [8], titanium [9], tungsten [10], as well as bimetallic ones [11–14]), which have a wide range of catalytic applications in chemical processes. However, the most applicable catalyst of the family is certainly Raney® nickel (metallic nickel sponge, skeletal nickel), primarily in conventional hydrogenation among other reactions under hydrogen pressure conditions (desulfurization [15], deoxygenation [16,17], hydrogenolysis [18], etc.). An alternative for all these types of the reactions is considered to be a reaction concept of intermolecular hydrogen transfer (transfer hydrogenation (TH), transfer hydrogenolysis, transfer hydrodeoxygenation, etc.). This concept intends to apply auxiliary H-donating molecules excluding the use of flammable and corrosive molecular hydrogen at elevated both pressure and temperature. Under the last reaction conditions, molecular H2 is known to possess a damage feature to deteriorate the mechanical properties of a metallic material of chemical reactors [19]. Thus, the hydrogen transfer methodology gains distinct competitive advantage over conventional hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis and other reactions under H2 pressure conditions. Moreover, this method became a new application niche and catalytic renaissance for Raney® nickel, for example, in reduction of monosaccharide sugars [20], ketones [21,22], nitriles [23] and nitro compounds [20], total hydrogenation of aromatics and alkynes [20], alkylations of amines [24], hydrodeiodination [25], hydrodeoxygenation of aromatic ketones [26,27], biomass refinery [28–32], etc. Importantly, Raney® nickel seems to be suitable and applicable for industrially valuable TH processes [33–36]. A serious drawback of Raney® nickel catalyst is its significant deactivation with time caused by a number of different reasons, which are very similar for both conventional hydrogenation processes and TH reactions (cf. a hydrogenation of monosaccharides catalyzed by Raney® nickel [37–39]). One of the reasons is an appreciable susceptibility to air oxygen. The last can easily oxidize a metallic surface of the catalyst to NiO [40,41] reducing the amount of catalytically active centers on the catalyst surface, and the same result can be achieved by oxidation with some other oxidants [42,43]. There was an interesting comparison of catalytic activity of Raney® nickel samples, which were stored for 10 days at room temperature under different atmospheres before testing – under N2, air, and pure oxygen [44]. It has been shown that the sample stored under oxygen atmosphere was much less active. Therefore, the surface oxidation of the catalyst is considered to be responsible for main contribution to the loss of its catalytic activity in some reactions [44]. Despite this conclusion, a paradoxical question is whether ""the air (oxygen) sensitivity"" of the Raney® nickel is always bad for chemistry? How big could be the difference between both a conversion and product selectivity observed in some reaction catalyzed by Raney® nickel under air and inert atmosphere? Could we use in practice the change of catalyst activity achieved under different atmospheres? Both activity of the catalyst and product selectivity usually have different functional behavior not changing in parallel. Consequently, the effect of catalyst structure on activity and selectivity should be considered separately to increase the effectiveness of the chemical process. For example, a controlled decrease of the catalytic activity of metal nickel via its partial poisoning is known to be applied to govern the hydrogenation selectivity towards different functional groups or substances of different reactivity [45,46]. In our opinion, the similar approach may be developed to govern the substrate conversion and the product selectivity by controlling the slight deactivation of Raney® nickel by air oxygen or using an inert atmosphere. The oxidation of metallic surface of Raney nickel is able to block a part of active sites of the catalyst surface lowering the activity of the catalyst and changing the selectivity on desired products. Unfortunately, the influence of air exposure on selectivity of TH reaction remains still poorly explored, as well as the difference between conversion and product selectivity in reactions catalyzed by Raney® nickel under air and inert atmosphere. At the same time, the reaction atmosphere may play a more significant role in TH reaction, since here a hydrogen source is not a gas (H2), but a liquid (alcohol). This study demonstrates how exposure to air or inert gas helps to manipulate and control the selectivity of TH reaction catalyzed by Raney® nickel. The difference of substrate conversion also is shown for the reactions under different reaction atmosphere. To perform these catalytic transformations, we provided a detailed comparison of the reactions conducted at 150 °C in alcohol under both argon and air atmosphere. Six different ketones (cyclohexanone, menthone, camphor, 5-hexen-2-one, acetophenone and benzophenone, Scheme 1 ) were chosen for TH to evaluate structure–activity relationship of C = O bearing molecules, as well as aliphatic and aromatic C = C bonds. 2-Propanol was used as both an H-donor and solvent. This work also aims ""to get to the bottom"" of significant reason how and why the changes of the catalyst structure influence the product selectivity of TH reaction although the main reasons are considered to be obvious and clear at first glance. Changes in structure and properties of the freshly prepared and spent Raney® nickel catalysts were identified by different methods (N2 physical adsorption, XRD, XPS, XRF, and TEM). Correlation between the properties of Raney® nickel and the features of TH reactions is presented and discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and solvents,"2.1 Chemicals and solvents All solvents and reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used as received: aluminum–nickel alloy (Al–Ni 50:50 wt %, Sigma–Aldrich), acetophenone (99%, Sigma–Aldrich), benzophenone (99%, Sigma–Aldrich), D-camphor (natural, 96%, Sigma–Aldrich), cyclohexanone (≥99%, Sigma–Aldrich), 5-hexen-2-one (99%, Sigma–Aldrich), (2S,5R)-(–)-menthone (97%, L-menthone, Alfa Aesar), 2-propanol (≥99.5%, Sigma–Aldrich), and sulfolane (99.0%, Aldrich)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Raney® nickel was prepared according to well-known leaching method from aluminum–nickel alloy [47]. So, 0.450 g of the alloy was added portion-wise to 5.6 mL of 20% aq. NaOH (a solution of 14.50 g of NaOH in 58.0 mL of distilled water) under vigorous stirring, the temperature was kept at about 50 °C. After adding the total amount of the alloy (10–15 min), the mixture was stirred for 45–50 minutes at 50 °C until the H2 evolution stopped. Then the skeletal nickel was washed out with distilled water (4 × 50 mL) until neutral pH and then additionally stirred with extra distilled water (15 mL) for 1.5 hours. Water was decanted away and 2-PrOH was added portion-wise (4 × 50 mL) to remote residual water from the prepared Raney® nickel. The prepared leached nickel was pyrophoric enough and usually used immediately after preparation. The catalyst was characterized by N2 physical adsorption, X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (see “Experimental Section” in Supplementary Materials file)."
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction The batch reactor equipped with mechanical agitator MagneDrive® (Autoclave Engineers) was charged by ∼ 3.2 mmole of substrate (0.39–0.60 g), 0.20–0.30 g of sulfolane (as an internal standard) and 120 mL of 2-PrOH. Six ketones were used as model substrates: cyclohexanone, menthone, camphor, 5-hexen-2-one, acetophenone and benzophenone (Scheme 1). After adding the catalyst freshly prepared from 0.45 g of aluminum–nickel alloy, the reactor was either purged with argon under stirring (for the further reaction under inert atmosphere) or operated without purging (for the further reaction under air). Then the reactor was closed and heated up with the rate of ∼7 °C min–1 to reach the reaction temperature of 150 ± 1 °C. The reaction was carried out at the constant temperature for 5 h with permanent stirring at 800 rpm. During the reaction, probes of the reaction mixture were collected hourly to the sampler. The final reaction mixture and all the other probes were analyzed by GC–MS method. The treatment of the spent catalysts under vacuum at 150 °C was made in rotary evaporator equipped with membrane vacuum pump (at a residual pressure ∼ 0.02 atm) for 1 h. After cooling down, the flask with a spent catalyst was filled with argon and then the catalyst was carefully passivated by air. The treatment of the freshly prepared Raney® nickel at 82 °C was conducted under reflux in glass reactor equipped with magnetic stirrer for 5 h. 2-PrOH was used as a reaction medium."
5,GC–MS analysis,"2.4 GC–MS analysis The identification of the products was performed by GC–MS method using a gas chromatograph Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010-SE (Japan) equipped with autosampler. A 30 m-long quartz capillary column VF-5ms with 0.25 mm i.d. was used for the analysis. The film thickness of the stationary phase (5% diphenylsiloxane – 95% dimethylsiloxane copolymer) was 0.25 μm; helium was as the carrier gas with a constant flow rate of 1.8 mL·min–1; a split ratio was 1:25; the injector temperature was 270 °C; the temperature program was 1 min at 50 °C, 50–270 °C (12 °C min–1), and 20 min at 270 °C. The qualitative analysis was carried out by comparing the retention time of the components and their experimental mass spectra with the corresponding data of the pure compounds or with the data from the NIST11 and Wiley9 mass spectral libraries. Sulfolane was used as an internal standard for the quantitative assessment of the products."
6,Re-using and recycling ability of Raney® nickel,"2.5 Re-using and recycling ability of Raney® nickel Re-using the catalyst was carried out according to the standard procedure described in Section 2.3. The only menthone (0.50 g) was used as initial substrate under argon atmosphere. After finishing the reaction (3 h), the reaction mixture was cooled down to 50 °C for 15 min and the reaction solution was carefully decanted. The spent catalyst was washed inside the reactor with 3 × 50 mL of 2-PrOH. After that, a fresh portion of initial reaction solution was loaded into the reactor. After fifth run, the spent catalyst was reactivated by washing it with 5.6 mL of 20% aq. NaOH for 1 h at room temperature, and then with 4 × 50 mL of distilled water till neutral pH. After 1.5 h stirring with extra 15 mL of distilled water, the last one was decanted away and 2-PrOH was added portion-wise (4 × 50 mL) to remote residual water from the spent Raney® nickel."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst structure,"3.1 Catalyst structure Raney® nickel was characterized by different physicochemical methods: XRD, N2 physical adsorption, XRF, TEM, ICP–MS and XPS. According to the analysis methods, the structure and properties of the prepared Raney® nickel were quite canonic close to well-known literature data. Nevertheless, the catalyst characterization made before and after the reaction allowed observing the changes in the catalyst properties and providing a better understanding of air influence on the TH reaction catalyzed by Raney® nickel. 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) data The XRD profiles of freshly prepared (F-catalyst) and spent (S-catalyst) Raney® nickel catalysts, as well as our initial Ni–Al alloy are provided in Fig. 1 . Al3Ni and Al3Ni2 phases together with traces of metal Al0 (peak at about 37.7°) were determined for the initial alloy. The mean crystallites size was 62 nm and 56 nm for Al3Ni and Al3Ni2, respectively. During the leaching, metal Ni° phase was expectedly formed (Fig. 2 B, F-catalyst) [48–50]. The additionally formed NiO phase (blue lines in Fig. 2B) confirmed the partial oxidation of Ni surface during a short contact with air. All peaks kept their positions in XRD profile of S-catalyst that proved the unchanged phase composition of the catalyst spent in TH under argon. No peaks of metal Al° were observed for both F- and S-catalysts. The mean size of Ni° crystallites was about 3.1 nm in F-catalyst that is typical for Raney® nickel [50,51]. Importantly, the crystallites size was almost unchanged after the TH reaction and remained similar for S-catalyst. No sintering was observed on the spent catalyst. As Ni° crystallites size could affect catalytic activity and selectivity [49,52], this factor had no influence on the Raney® nickel activity in TH reaction under consideration. 3.1.2 N2 physical adsorption The measured specific surface area of the particles of initial Ni–Al alloy was about 2 m2/g. The specific surface area of both F- and S-catalysts was determined to be in a range of 60–80 m2/g and did not change dramatically during the reaction. These results are in agreement with literature data [43,47–49]. It appears as though the TH reaction conditions had also no influence on the specific surface area of spent Raney® nickel catalyst. 3.1.3 XRF and ICP–MS data The freshly prepared Raney® nickel catalyst (F-catalyst) comprised of 86.5 wt % of nickel and 10.3 wt % of aluminum. This was in good accordance with results described elsewhere [47,53]. The rest of 3.2 wt % was oxygen (as a result of partial oxidation of both metals during the handling or passivation of the sample before the analysis) and minor metals of the initial Ni–Al alloy (Fe, K, Na). Leaching the admixture metals in the reaction solution is a reasonable assumption: they could be leached from the catalyst into alcohol during the TH reaction and catalyzed homogeneously the chemical transformations observed. For example, aluminum alkoxides are well-known effective catalyst in homogeneous TH reaction [54,55]. To evaluate the possible leaching, ICP–MS analysis was used to determine traces of the metals (wt %) in the reaction solution. According to ICP–MS data, the total aluminum content in pure 2-PrOH was about 4.0 ppm and not changed during the reaction neither under air nor argon atmosphere. At the same time, the nickel content was about 2 wt.% of the total aluminum content in the solution and increased from initial 180 to final 210 ppb for 3 h of the reaction. The origin of the extra Ni could be the reactor walls [56] together with the catalyst itself. To exclude the possible catalytic effect of these leached metals, the catalytic activity of the leaching solution was tested after Raney® nickel removing from it. So, no conversion of menthone was observed at 150 °C for 3 h of the TH reaction. This proved the Raney® nickel as a true heterogeneous catalyst of the TH reaction. When the S-catalyst was washed up (re-activated) with 20% aq. NaOH after 5th catalytic run and further re-used in the reaction, the two-fold decrease of aluminum content was then detected in the catalyst (down to 5.2 wt %), whereas the nickel percentage in the S-catalyst expectedly increased to 91.2 wt %. The content of other elements in the S-catalyst was slightly higher (3.6 wt %) than that in the F-catalyst mainly due to the increase of total oxygen content. The significant decrease of the total Al content in the spent catalyst after its re-activation was obviously caused by washing up with aq. NaOH (not leaching by alcohol during the reaction). It means that aluminum atoms diffused from the catalyst bulk to the surface and then oxidized by air were leaching with aq. alkali during the re-activation procedure. At the same time, aqueous alkali couldn’t remove NiO formed on the metal surface during all the runs. 3.1.4 TEM images TEM images of the freshly prepared Raney® nickel (F-catalyst) are presented in Fig. 2 A and Fig. 2 B , while Fig. 2 C and Fig. 2 D show TEM images of spent Raney® nickel catalyst after the reaction under argon (S-catalyst). So, the F-catalyst was micron-sized agglomerated particles consisted of small crystallites, the mean size of which was about 3.1 nm according to our XRD data (see Part 3.1.1.). The images (B),(C),(D) in Fig. 2 demonstrate a sponge-like porous structure of Raney® nickel catalysts having many branched mesoporous channels, which were described many times elsewhere [49,50,57,58]. As known, the segregation behavior of Al atoms significantly affects the surface composition of NiAl-alloys [59,60] modifying the catalytic properties of Raney® nickel too. Additionally, this surface segregation can be promoted by interaction of the alloy surface with reductive or oxidative reaction media [61]. The result of such surface segregation was expected to be Al-enrichment of the catalyst surface during the TH reaction (see Fig. 2C and Fig. 2D). Here, alumina formed both the particles (Fig. 2C, region 1) and the chains (Fig. 2D, region 3) comparable in size with sponge-like structures (Fig. 2C, region 2). Interestingly, the similar alumina particles were formed if the F-catalyst was exposed in vacuum at 150 °C for 3 h or treated by pure 2-PrOH at 82 °C for the same 3 h under argon. It means that neither alcohol medium nor the reaction temperature was of key importance in Al migration from the bulk to the catalyst surface (the surface segregation). It is highly likely that the newly-formed crystallites consisted of alumina or aluminum (oxy)hydroxides species, probably with some metallic aluminum [50]. Therefore, these particles will be further referred to as “alumina” that is suitable enough. Importantly, no alumina particles were observed in the freshly prepared catalyst, i.e. alumina was exclusively formed with time during either the reaction or storage, not after rapid handling under air that agrees with known data [58]. Very similar results were obtained for the spent catalysts after the TH reaction under air atmosphere: the newly-formed alumina particles had some inclusions with a sponge-like structure too (Fig. 2 E , region 5). EDX analysis of this S-catalyst presented in Fig. 2 F detected that the particles comprised of Al, Ni, O and C elements. The last one could arise from organic compounds (alcohol, substrate or products) chemosorbed on the catalyst surface. Earlier, the alumina grains on Raney® nickel surface were only detected for the freshly prepared catalyst [50,51]. Authors of this study failed to find any literature data on the Al2O3-particles formation over the surface of spent Raney® nickel catalysts used in any reactions. This information is very important taking into account the known ability of alumina to block active sites of Raney® nickel and to inhibit hydrogenation [51,62]. The similar formation of small alumina particles has been observed earlier at the initial leaching stage of Raney® nickel preparation [50]. So, 10 s leaching by aq. alkali resulted in the Al2O3 formation on the surface of Ni–Al alloy and fabricated the same sponge-like structure. It can be assumed that the newly-formed branched pores on the catalyst surface facilitate the further aluminum diffusion from the bulk to the surface followed by Al° oxidation to Al2O3 or aluminum (oxy)hydroxide with simultaneous aggregation into larger alumina species. Some ""apparent contradiction"" arising from the same specific surface area of the F- and S-catalysts, which was determined by physical N2 adsorption (Part 3.1.2), ceases to exist if one accepts the fact that the BET area of the catalysts depends on two contributors – a metal Ni° surface and the newly-formed alumina particles on it. The last ones have a non-zero BET area. At the same time, the alumina particles formed on the catalyst surface both blocked active sites and changed the selectivity [50]. Contrary to this, removing Al2O3 from Raney® nickel by aq. alkali was known to facilitate the C–N bond hydrogenolysis increasing the catalytic activity of succinonitrile hydrogenation to 1,4-diaminobutane [50]. Thus, the formation of alumina on the catalyst surface does play an important role in governing the activity and product selectivity of Raney® nickel catalyst. 3.1.5 XPS data XPS data for the catalysts are shown in Tables 1 and 2 (see also Supplementary Materials file). All our data evidenced that each Raney® nickel catalyst in course of its preparation procedure, reactor (un-)loading, storage and handling necessarily underwent the partial oxidation of Al0 and Ni0 on the catalyst surface for any reaction conditions. For example, the similar action of oxygen was observed for metallic nickel: percentage of Ni2+ on the catalyst surface increased and reached 17%, 41% and 67% for freshly prepared, spent under argon and under air atmosphere, respectively (according to Ni 2p spectra, Table 1). The same trend was observed for Ni2+ in Ni 3p spectra. The amounts of metallic nickel were decreased in parallel in both Ni 2p and Ni 3p spectra (Table 1). The increased amount of Ni2+ cations (and decreased amount of Ni0) pointed to the increase of NiO amount on the surface. As opposed to metallic nickel, at least two Raney® nickel catalysts, which were freshly prepared and spent under argon, contained the same ratio of Al0/Al3+ (24/76 vs. 25/75, correspondingly, for each of the catalysts, Table 1). The 3-fold predominance of Al3+ over Al° in the near-surface layers of the catalyst (Table 2) was only possible if the most alumina particles weren’t washed away by alcohol during the reaction. Both Al3+ cations and Al° atoms tended to diffuse with time to the catalyst surface due to a phenomenon of surface segregation in multi-metal alloys [59,60]. Oxygen atmosphere facilitated the oxidation of residual near-surface Al°: for the TH reaction under air, the Al°/Al3+ ratio decreased ca. by 2.5 times for the S-catalyst (13/87, Table 2). XPS data showed a surprising change of the Ni–Al ratios: both Ni 3p/Al and Ni 2p/Al values increased after the TH reactions as if the catalyst surface was enriched with Ni (Table 1), but this contradicts literature data [61]. The “enrichment with Ni” could be explained by leaching the aluminum, but there was no leaching process during the reaction (see our ICP–MS data). Our reasonable explanation is a growth of crystallites size (grains size) of alumina on the catalyst surface. As seen on TEM images, Al2O3 formed micron-sized agglomerated particles (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, the size of these alumina crystallites was higher than the penetration depth of XPS analysis that made the most of near-surface aluminum (both Al0 and Al3+) undetectable by this method. The same reason can explain the fact that the noticeable oxidation of metal Ni was detected for the reaction under argon (as compared with the F-catalyst) whereas the Al0/Al3+ ratio was unchanged."
9,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance To demonstrate the influence of inert argon and oxidative air atmosphere on the catalyzed TH reaction, six different ketones were used (Scheme 1) under the same reaction conditions (150 °C, 5 h, 0.250 g of Raney® nickel per 3.2 mmole of substrate). Two main reasons for choosing the substrates were: (i) ketones and olefins are the most deeply studied molecules in TH reaction [22,63,64], but not under both inert and oxidative atmosphere; (ii) the first three of the substrates (cyclohexanone, menthone and camphor) are structurally similar cyclohexane ketones, while the second three (5-hexen-2-one, acetophenone and benzophenone) contain competing functional groups (additional C = C bond or benzene ring) that can give new information about their chemical reactivity in the TH reaction and mutual influence. Total conversion of cyclohexanone was reached in 30 min of the reaction resulted in the formation of cyclohexanol as a single product, which was highly stable under the chosen reaction conditions (Fig. 3 ) without further transformation into other by-products. The reaction of cyclohexanone under air was conducted to estimate the possible influence of the reaction atmosphere on the conversion and/or the product selectivity. So, under air, the cyclohexanone conversion achieved ∼100% only after 5 h of the reaction accompanied by some cyclohexene formation (up to ∼ 1%) as result of cyclohexanol dehydration. The TH reaction of menthone was a noticeably slower process than that of cyclohexanone under both argon and air atmosphere (Fig. 4 ). So, under inert atmosphere, almost total conversion (98%) was observed after 3 h, whereas 43% of initial menthone was still unchanged even after 5 h of reaction under air. The difference in reactivity of cyclohexanone and menthone seems to be due to well-known steric hindrance and electronic effect of isopropyl substituent which can block the reduction of adjacent C = O group [65,66]. Keto-enol tautomerization of initial menthone (Scheme 2 ) was negligible under the both reaction conditions: concentration of iso-menthone as well as isomeric menthols formed from it was always low in the reaction mixtures. Nevertheless, the tautomerization was somewhat slower under air: menthone-to-iso-menthone ratio was 97:3 after 5 h of the reaction under air vs. 70:30 under argon (cf. [67]). Unexpectedly, a kind of gaseous atmosphere of the TH reaction was important enough for stereoselectivity of the C = O reduction (Fig. 4) resulted in different yields of isomeric menthol and neo-menthol obtained. So, for the reaction under argon, the dependence of products yield vs. reaction time was usual exponential. Menthol dominated over neo-menthol (the difference was ∼ 16% in the final reaction mixture), maybe due to a difference between their heats of formation and specific sorption of menthone molecule on Ni surface resulted in preferred and facilitated reduction of C = O bond from one of two sides of its plane. Another reason to explain the different yields of isomeric menthols may be their heterogeneously catalyzed epimerization on a nickel catalyst, which is well-known and well-studied. The equilibrium constant for the epimerization of menthol/neo-menthol diastereomers was 2.3 at 150 °C [68] that was used in the industrial production of menthol in the Symrise process (or Haarmann & Reimer process). In our reaction at 150 °C under argon, the menthol-to-neo-menthol ratio (1.4) was far from equilibrium, but the ratio tended to increase slowly (Fig. 4). Contrary to these reasons, quite another behavior was observed for the reaction under air atmosphere. The dependence of products yield (and menthone conversion too) vs. reaction time was straight line for each of them that was very unusual and unexpected. Moreover, the yields of both menthol and neo-menthol were equal to each other during all 5 h of the reaction (Fig. 4). Thus, if the synthesis of neo-menthol from menthone would be the main goal of some study, the TH reaction catalyzed by Raney® nickel under air atmosphere can be considered as an appropriate and suitable method. Probably, the difference in selectivities observed for the same reaction time of TH process, but under different reaction atmospheres (argon or air) could arise from the difference in conversions, at which the selectivities were compared. In order to clarify it, we increased the reaction time to 24 h of menthone transfer hydrogenation under air atmosphere to achieve higher conversion levels, which were the same or similar to those under argon. So, 98% conversion of menthone was achieved for this reaction time. The ratio of isomeric menthols (menthol-to-neo-menthol-to-iso-menthol-to-neo-iso-menthol) was 46:49:2:1. It means that the menthols selectivity observed at nearly full conversion in TH under air was quite the same as at 57% conversion (see Fig. 4, right graph, 5 h) and differed a lot from that in TH under argon (see Fig. 4, left graph, 2 h). Thus, it confirmed the effect of the reaction atmosphere on changing both the TH reaction rate and the product selectivity. The dependence of camphor conversion vs. reaction time was rather similar to the menthone reaction (Fig. 5 ): 54% of initial camphor was hydrogenated to borneols under argon, whereas only 39% of camphor reacted at the same reaction temperature and duration under air atmosphere. The similar exponential kinetic curves were under inert atmosphere and close to straight lines under air (Fig. 5). However, intersection of the curves of iso-borneol and borneol was observed for 3 h of the reaction under argon: before this point the concentration of iso-borneol was higher than that of isomeric borneol in the reaction mixture. After 3 h of the reaction, borneol became dominating product. Under air, the TH reaction was slower and no intersection of kinetic curves was observed after 5 h (Fig. 5). The yield of iso-borneol was always two times higher than that of borneol. As for menthone, we increased the reaction time to 24 h, for which camphor conversion was achieved 54% under air. The ratio of isomeric borneols (iso-borneol-to-borneol) was 24:30. Both conversion and borneols selectivity observed were quite the same as for 5 h under argon (see Fig. 5, left graph). Unlike the menthone reaction and menthols selectivity, the selectivity on borneols exhibited no dependence on the reaction atmosphere. According to XPS analysis, oxidation of the catalyst surface went deeper. Formed Ni2+ and Al3+ cations are weak Lewis acids, which could promote the alcohols isomerization (both borneols and menthols). Moreover, oxygen was suggested to bind unevenly with the Raney® nickel surface to form NiO and affect kinetics of the TH reaction. This suggestion needs to be studied in detail in future research. As compared with C = O group, the reduction of C = C bond in 5-hexen-2-one was significantly faster under both argon and air conditions (Fig. 6 ). However, the hydrogenation of both double bonds was slower under air atmosphere. So, under argon, only residual amount of unchanged 5-hexen-2-one was observed already at the beginning of the reaction (zero reaction time) and, after 1 h, there was no unreduced C = C bonds in the products. At the same time, conversion of C = O group achieved 96% for 1 h of the reaction without a further change with time, maybe due to well-known reversibility of TH reduction of ketones and aldehydes [69]. One can compare the reaction for 5 h under air, in which the reduction of intermediate hexan-2-one was stopped at 92% of conversion. Two aromatic ketones (acetophenone and benzophenone) were also involved in the reaction (Scheme 1). The first one is well-studied “reference” molecule in the TH reaction, especially in homogeneously catalyzed version [21,55,70,71]. In contrast to above described substrates, the TH reaction of aromatic ketones is often accompanied by both the transfer hydrogenolysis of C = O group (hydrodeoxygenation) and dearomatization of aromatic ring [72] inhibited by air. The hydrogenolysis of C = O bond in acetophenone proceeded extremely fast under argon resulting in ethylbenzene formation (78% for 0 h of the reaction at 94% of acetophenone conversion, Fig. 7 ). Excluding a small amount of 1-cyclohexylethanol, no other oxygen-containing products were observed for 1–2 h of the reaction. The further dearomatization of ethylbenzene to ethylcyclohexane also proceeded fast enough. The kinetics feature of the acetophenone reaction under air was rather different. The max yield of ethylbenzene (91%) was reached in 2 h of the reaction followed by a weak decreasing trend (Fig. 7). At the same time, the yield of ethylcyclohexane (the second main product) increased slowly and monotonically during all the reaction time reaching only 17% at the end. Thus, air conditions are more suitable and convenient for chemoselective synthesis of ethylbenzene, whereas the reduction under argon is a proper method for ethylcyclohexane production. The known structure sensitivity of metal nickel catalysts in reductive reactions [73,74] is our explanation of the phenomenon. For example, a benzene ring is usually adsorbed much better on larger Ni0 particles resulted in further rapid hydrogenation [74]. If the partial oxidation of the Ni0 surface took place, the ensemble of active centers was decomposed that entailed decreasing the adsorption efficiency of benzene ring. The similar data was obtained for TH of benzophenone: the main reactions were hydrodeoxygenation of C = O group followed by stepwise dearomatization of two benzene rings. Under argon, the total benzophenone conversion was observed for 0.5 h of the reaction, whereas under air it was after 4 h only (Fig. 8 ). Diphenylmethane as a product of hydrodeoxygenation reacted totally for 1 h of the reaction under argon to be partially hydrogenated into cyclohexylphenylmethane. The yield of dicyclohexylmethane (the product of total hydrodeoxygenation/hydrogenation) increased monotonically during all the reaction time reaching 34% at the end. Interestingly, the reduction of first benzene ring in diphenylmethane molecule proceeded faster although the both rings were isolated from each other (non-conjugated). The same result was described in our previous work [72]. Finally, cyclohexylphenylmethane and dicyclohexylmethane derived from it were the main products for 1 h of the reaction under argon and their amounts were highly anti-correlated with each other. The same chemical transformations of benzophenone under air were significantly slower reactions (Fig. 8). The total conversion of benzophenone was only observed for 4 h of the TH reduction. Dicyclohexylmethane was a minor product which yield never exceeded 2%. The dearomatization of both benzene rings was slow enough. The hydrodeoxygenation of C = O group catalyzed by Raney® nickel was a simple and fast process only for aromatic ketones like Ar–CO–R (in our cases R = CH3 or Ph), but not for aliphatic ones (Alk–CO–Alk). The noticeably slower hydrodeoxygenation of C = O group under air can be caused by more active migration of Al on the catalyst surface forming alumina crystallites which were visible by TEM method, but invisible for XPS technique. This suggestion is in good accordance with the results obtained earlier [50] and partially supported by our catalyst recycling experiment."
10,Catalyst re-cycling,"3.3 Catalyst re-cycling Catalyst lifetime is one of the most important properties of every catalyst, especially of industrial ones. Despite widespread use of Raney® nickel in industry, its lifetime is short enough and needs to be improved [49,54]. Usually, sintering is a main cause of Raney® nickel deactivation [62] as well as partial blocking of micropores of the catalyst by the products during the reaction. So, the catalyst re-cycling procedure may sufficiently reduce the lost activity [57]. Under our reaction conditions, such deactivation mechanism seems to be improper or irrelevant compared with the possible partial oxidation of the catalyst surface [61]. To prove this assumption, menthone was chosen as a model substrate and studied in the catalyst recycling experiment. The reactions were carried out under argon atmosphere (Fig. 9 ) to avoid the oxidation of the Ni surface by air oxygen. One can see that the menthone conversion decreased by one-thirds after 5 runs (from 98% down to 62%). After re-activation, the catalytic activity of the spent Raney® nickel increased to become equal to that on forth run (76% and 79%, respectively), after which the activity rapidly dropped again (down to 49%). The quick repeated deactivation indicates that the partial blocking of micropores of the catalyst was not the main cause of decreasing the catalytic activity."
11,Some interpretations,"3.4 Some interpretations As shown by XPS and TEM methods, the partial oxidation of Ni° surface and simultaneous formation of alumina particles on it proceeded under both air and argon atmosphere, but under argon these processes were much slower and less pronounced. In our opinion, the formation of alumina particles on the catalyst surface and their growth during the reaction is a very important result. If the oxidation of the Ni° surface into NiO would be a main cause of the catalyst deactivation, the re-activation procedure (washing up with aq. NaOH) had no effect on recovering the catalytic activity of Raney® nickel. Thus, the surface segregation of aluminum followed by agglomeration of alumina into the micron-sized particles is a key reason of the Raney nickel deactivation and change of the products selectivity under transfer hydrogenation conditions. The agglomerated alumina crystallites do change the adsorption capacity of the catalyst together with the catalytic activity and efficiency (similar to conventional hydrogenation [50]). The removal of alumina by the re-activation procedure (from initial 10.3 wt % to 5.2 wt % of aluminum after repeated leaching) increased the catalyst activity, but it was a short-time activation due to the known effect of the residual alumina acting as a structural promoter of Raney® nickel catalyst [62]. Therefore, additional removal of alumina results in sintering and loss of the catalytic activity. Thus, alumina species make important contribution to Raney® nickel activity and chemoselectivity of the TH reactions."
12,Conclusions,"Inhibiting effect of air atmosphere on the catalytic activity of Raney® nickel in transfer hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenolysis of different ketones has been studied. It has been shown that the catalytic reduction of C = C and C = O bonds as well as benzene ring dearomatization slow down under air, but this effect was not the same for each reaction. Olefinic C = C bond was hydrogenated faster than C = O group, whereas hydrogenation and dearomatization of benzene ring was the slowest reaction under both argon and air atmosphere. The hydrodeoxygenation of C = O group catalyzed by Raney® nickel was shown to be a simple and fast process only for aromatic ketones like Ar–CO–R (in our cases R = CH3 or Ph), but not for aliphatic ones (Alk–CO–Alk). The same hydrodeoxygenation was true for benzylic alcohols (Ar–CH(OH)–R) as compared with aliphatic alcohols. However, under air, the difference between “reaction rates” of hydrodeoxygenation and dearomatization was usually changed depending on the chemical structure of the model compounds. The “gap” between the changing magnitude of both conversion and product yield in the TH reaction of acetophenone increased, whereas it decreased for benzophenone reaction. This effect gives a nice opportunity to govern a product selectivity including chemo-, regio- and stereo-selectivity. The synthetic difference controlled by varying the “gaseous” reaction atmosphere is caused by formation of micron-sized alumina grains (crystallites) on the catalyst surface during the TH reaction, as well as by partial oxidation of the metal catalyst surface. This “alumina formation” effect was detected for the first time in TH reactions and demonstrated under both argon and air atmosphere. The alumina crystallites on the catalyst surface together with partial oxidation have strong influence on the reaction catalyzed by Raney® nickel. The removal of alumina from the surface by the re-activation procedure resulted in partial recovery of catalytic activity and the increase of menthone conversion."
