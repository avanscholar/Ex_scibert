0,Introduction,"The use of biomass as a raw material for the production of chemicals, fuels and materials can be seen as a game-changer in the chemical industry. From an environmental viewpoint, these raw materials are more ecofriendly than fossil raw materials because they are renewable. From a societal and political viewpoint, the use of local biomass could revitalize rural areas and create new jobs (Budzianowski and Postawa, 2016). The choice of biomass raw material is crucial and must respect several criteria, such as: - The cultivation of this biomass should not lead to soil and groundwater pollution. - The biomass should not be used in the alimentary sector. - An optimum synergy between the harvest, transportation and storage should be found. - A total valorization of the biomass must be done. In order to avoid the dilemma of food versus fuel, the use of second-generation biomass as a raw material in the chemical industry should be privileged. Second-generation biomass can be lignocellulosic biomass, agricultural waste, or dedicated non-food crops (miscanthus, switchgrass) on non-agricultural lands. The valorization of lignocellulosic biomass at the industrial scale has considerably increased these recent years (Chandel et al., 2020). One of the main challenges is the pretreatment step to separate lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose for further upgrading into valuable chemicals, fuels, or materials. One can mention the commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol production plant by GranBio company in Brazil, with a capacity production of 82 million liters per year (GranBio, 2014). Energy cane, straw and sugarcane bagasse can be used as raw materials. These raw materials were pretreated by steam explosion, and then enzymatic processes were used for hydrolysis and fermentation steps. Another successful lignocellulosic industrial application is the Borregaad plant in Sarpsborg (Norway), producing vanillin via the sulfite pulping method (Wong, 2012). This plant has a production capacity of 250tonnes per year and used spruce trees as feedstocks (Borregaard, 2019). Another promising molecule produced from lignocellulosic biomass and more specifically from cellulose and hemicellulose is levulinic acid, which was classified as a top 10 building blocks or platform molecules by the U.S. Department of Energy (Gallezot, 2012). Levulinic acid is industrially produced from the acid hydrolysis of cellulose (Hayes et al., 2005). At the industrial scale, GFBiochemicals is the main company to produce this molecule (ca. 10000tonnes per year) via ATLAS Technology™(Makhubela and Darkwa, 2018; Pulidindi and Kim, 2018). There is also a growing interest to study the production of alkyl levulinates from the alcoholysis of cellulose or hemicellulose (Peng et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2015; An et al., 2017; Di Bitonto et al., 2018). These levulinates are still considered as platform molecules with the primary benefits to be less corrosive than levulinic acid. Further upgrading of levulinic acid or alkyl levulinates is by hydrogenation to γ-valerolactone (GVL). This molecule is of particular interest because it is also a platform molecule (Yan et al., 2015). Indeed, GVL can be used as fuel additives and solvents and has excellent potential for further upgrading to valuable chemicals, materials, and fuels (Bozell et al., 2000; Huber et al., 2006; Horváth et al., 2008; Bond et al., 2010; Serrano-Ruiz et al., 2010; Alonso et al., 2012; Qi and Horváth, 2012; Wettstein et al., 2012; Luterbacher et al., 2014; Mellmer et al., 2014; Tukacs et al., 2015; Rodenas et al., 2018; Sener et al., 2018; Al-Naji et al., 2019) The use of molecular hydrogen to produce this molecule from LA or alkyl levulinates is widely studied by different research groups to find the best catalyst (Wright and Palkovits, 2012; Luo et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2014; Dutta et al., 2019; Tanwongwan et al., 2019; Wojciechowska et al., 2019; Feng et al., 2020), to intensify this process (Bourne et al., 2007; Al-Shaal et al., 2016), or to develop advanced kinetic models (Piskun et al., 2016; Negahdar et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Protsenko et al., 2020). The most common heterogeneous catalyst for this reaction is Ru/C. The hydrogenation of LA of alkyl levulinate over Ru/C to GVL is a two-step reaction (Scheme 1 ). Few papers are dealing with the safety aspect of this reaction system (Wang et al., 2018; Casson Moreno et al., 2019), which can be a severe issue. Indeed, the use of biomass feedstock receives a positive perception from public opinion as shown by different studies (Zoellner et al., 2008; Dockerty et al., 2012; Soland et al., 2013; Kortsch et al., 2015; Sikorska et al., 2020), except when there is a risk of air pollution (Upham and Shackley, 2007). A risk assessment must be performed to implement adequate safety barriers to preserve the excellent perception of such industries. For instance, it was shown that several accidents occurred in the bioenergy production sector (Casson Moreno and Cozzani, 2015; Casson Moreno et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2016). In a previous study, it was shown that hydrogenation of levulinic acid in water solvent could present a severe risk of thermal runaway according to the operating conditions (Wang et al., 2018) The assessment of such risk must be done. Indeed, Dakkoune et al. demonstrated that this risk is responsible for around 25 % of the accident in the French chemical plants (Dakkoune et al., 2018) For quantifying a thermal risk, one needs to calculate/estimate probability and severity parameters under adiabatic conditions and in batch mode, i.e., the worst-case scenario (Stoessel, 2008; Leveneur et al., 2016). The knowledge of the Time-to-Maximum Rate under adiabatic conditions (TMRad) parameter can assess the probability of thermal runaway (Stoessel, 2008). This parameter is defined as the time to reach the maximum temperature rate. The adiabatic temperature rise under adiabatic condition (ΔTad) is a parameter evaluating the severity of the thermal risk. To estimate these thermal risk parameters at different operating conditions, one needs to investigate kinetics (reaction order, rate constants, activation energy…) and thermodynamics (specific heat capacity, reaction enthalpy…) of a chemical system. There are several strategies to obtain these parameters. The most widespread approach is to perform some experiments in an adiabatic calorimeter and apply a zero-order approach to estimate TMRad and ΔTad. The main drawback of such an approach is that one cannot estimate the values of these parameters at different operating conditions (Vernières-Hassimi et al., 2017). The other issue concerning the determination of these parameters comes from the experimental part. Kinetic models can be developed based on experiments performed under isothermal conditions at process temperatures, and thermodynamic constants could be measured in calorimeter or evaluated via thermodynamic models. However, this approach is not representative of a thermal runaway because one can miss the observation of secondary reactions or other side reactions occurring at higher temperatures, which could worsen the accident (Stoessel, 2008). The thermal runaway assessment must be done based on experiments performed under adiabatic conditions. For that, there are several calorimeters: ARSST (Marco et al., 2000; Tang et al., 2009; Veedhi and Sawant, 2013; Veedhi et al., 2014; Vernières-Hassimi et al., 2017; Leveneur, 2017; Leveneur et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2019; Pérez-Sena et al., 2020), VPS2 (Delhaye et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2008; Chi et al., 2009; Jhu et al., 2012; Tseng et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2017), PhiTecII (Singh, 1993; Sempere et al., 1997; Maestri et al., 2006; Valdes et al., 2016; Saha et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2019) and RC1 (Lunghi et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2019, 2020a,b). The main challenge for the gas-liquid-solid system is the mixing issue. High-pressurized RC1 Mettler-Toledo can ensure an efficient mixing for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid or alkyl levulinaves over Ru/C. In this manuscript, thermal risk assessments of methyl levulinate and butyl levulinate hydrogenation to GVL over Ru/C were conducted. These two alkyl levulinates can be produced from the alcoholysis of cellulose and are less corrosive than GVL. The benefit of the GVL solvent is its low vapor pressure value with temperature, high flash point (96°C), and low melting point (−31°C). GVL is considered a promising solvent (Horváth et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2017; Pokorný et al., 2017; Chew et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). In a previous study of our group (Wang et al., 2019), it was demonstrated that hydrogenation of these alkyl levulinates in GVL over Ru/C is a two-step reaction, as illustrated by Scheme 1. Some experiments were performed in RC1 Mettler-Toledo under isothermal and adiabatic conditions. To the best of our knowledge, the use of adiabatic conditions with such reaction volume is rare in the literature. In the first stage, a methodology was developed to experimentally measure the reaction enthalpy of each reaction step for ML and BL hydrogenation system in GVL. Two different calorimeters were used for this stage: RC1 calorimeter and Tian-Calvet calorimeter. In the second stage, kinetic models for both substrates were developed based on experiments in RC1 under adiabatic conditions. From the estimated kinetic constants and measured thermodynamic constants, thermal risk assessment was performed."
1,Experimental Section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Methyl levulinate (wt% ≥ 98 %) and γ-valerolactone (wt% ≥ 99 %) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Alfa Aesar provided n-Butyl levulinate (wt%≥98 %). Acros Organics supplied furfural (wt% ≥ 99 %). Alfa Aesar provided Ru/C (5wt % ruthenium on activated carbon powder, reduced and 50 % water wet). Linde supplied H2 (>99.999 %). Acetone (Analytical grade) was bought from VWR. Sulfuric acid (wt% ≥ 98 %) was obtained from Fisher chemicals. All the chemicals were used without further treatment."
3,RC1 experiments,"2.2 RC1 experiments Hydrogenation of ML or BL to GVL catalyzed over Ru/C in the GVL solvent was performed in RC1, which includes pressure system, temperature system and process control system (Fig. 1 ). The experiments were performed under isothermal or adiabatic, and isobaric conditions assured by the process control system and jacket temperature control system. A gas entrainment impeller was used to ensure efficient gas-liquid mixing. 2.2.1 Experiments under isothermal conditions At first, an alkyl levulinate solution was introduced to the reactor with the Ru/C catalyst. Then, the sealed reactor was purged with nitrogen three times before increasing temperature in the reactor to 130°C. The stirring was stopped, and valve 2 was closed when the reactor temperature reached 130°C. After that, valve 1 was open, and ca. 35bar of hydrogen was injected into the reactor. When reaching 35bar in the reactor, valve 1 was closed, and the pressure in the reservoir was around 70bar. In this way, the storage gas in the reservoir was enough to maintain the pressure constant in the reactor during the reaction by the automatic pressure control system. The stirring was fixed to 800rpm to start the reaction. Under isothermal condition, the jacket temperature control system was set to keep the reaction temperature constant. During the reaction time, no sample was taken to avoid any interferences with the reaction temperature signal. GC analyzed the initial and final reaction mixture. Table 1 shows the operating conditions for both experiments in the RC1 calorimeter. 2.2.2 Experiments under adiabatic condition The alkyl levulinate solution was introduced into the reactor, followed by a nitrogen purge. The initial reaction temperature was set to 100°C under adiabatic mode. Experiments were carried out under isobaric conditions at 35bar. The stirring speed was set at 800rpm to start the reaction. No samples were withdrawn during adiabatic experiments. Table 2 shows the operating conditions for both experiments in the RC1 calorimeter under adiabatic conditions."
4,C80 experiments,"2.3 C80 experiments Cyclization experiments were performed in the Tian-Calvet calorimeter C80 (Fig. 2 ) (Zheng et al., 2016). The calorimeter C80 is a differential calorimeter operating under isothermal condition and requires a small amount of reaction mixture (1g). To only measure the heat flow rate due to reaction 2, solutions with a high concentration of intermediates were prepared. For that, the RC1 calorimeter was used, and the reaction was stopped before the full conversion of the intermediate to GVL. Then, the solution was filtered to remove the heterogeneous catalyst. The solutions were stored in a fridge to quench the cyclization reaction. Table 3 shows the operating conditions for experiments in the C80. Hastelloy cells were used: one reference cell and one measurement cell. The temperature and heat flow rate was monitored during the experiments. For this study, the experiments were performed at 60°C to avoid liquid evaporation and cyclization reaction in the reference cell. The cell contains two major parts: inside an open tube and an outside container (Fig. 2). For the measurement cell, the inside tube was filled with 1mL of the reaction mixture, and the outside was filled with 1mL of sulfuric acid solution in GVL concentrated at 0.01mol.L−1. Sulfuric acid was used to catalyze the cyclization to obtain a neat signal. For the reference cell, the inside tube was filled with 1ml of the reaction mixture, and the outside container was filled with 1ml of pure GVL. The reference cell must have a similar specific heat capacity (m × Cp) than the measurement one, and no reaction must occur in this cell. At this temperature and in the absence of catalyst, the cyclization kinetics is negligible. This absence of reaction in the reference cell was confirmed by GC analysis. After the preparation of the cells, they were put inside the C80 calorimeter vertically, and the temperature of this calorimeter was fixed to 60°C. When the temperature reached 60°C, and the heat flow rate was stable, the calorimeter started to rotate continuously. When this rotating process started, the liquids in the inside tube and outside container were mixed, and the reaction started. After ca. 3h reaction, the rotating was stopped, and the calorimeter was cooled down. A GC analysis was carried out on the initial and final reaction mixture from the reference and measurement cells."
5,Analytical section,"2.4 Analytical section The concentration of substrates (ML, BL), intermediates (MHP, BHP), and GVL was quantified by GC-FID analysis. Samples were filtered and diluted with acetone. Furfural was used as an internal standard for quantification. Bruker Scion GC436 gas chromatography (GC) equipped with an FID detector (flame ionization detector), an autosampler, and a capillary column (Rxi-5ms, 30m ×0.32mm internal diameter ×0.25μm film thickness) were used. Helium (99.99 %) was used as carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1.2mL.min−1. The temperature of the injector and the detector was set at 270°C. The oven temperature was programmed as 35°C (3min)-15°C.min−1-300°C. The injection volume was 5μL, and the split ratio was 30:1. The standard deviation of analytical measurement was found to be lower than 0.70 % indicating the high repeatability of the analysis."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Determination of reaction enthalpies,"3.1 Determination of reaction enthalpies The mechanism for hydrogenation of alkyl levulinates to GVL is a two-step reaction (Scheme 1). The first step is hydrogenation of the carbonyl group to the intermediate (MHP or BHP). The second step is the cyclization of the intermediate to GVL. Based on this mechanism, one needs to evaluate/measure the two reaction enthalpies. In this study, both reaction enthalpies were calculated. GVL was used as a solvent for these experiments because BL and ML are soluble in GVL (Wang et al., 2019). The other benefit of GVL is its low vapor pressure value, e.g., 9.21 × 10−4 bar at 92.11°C, allowing to work at higher temperatures (Pokorný et al., 2017). The reaction enthalpies Δ H R , 1 was defined as the amount of energy released/consumed by the hydrogenation reaction per mole of alkyl levulinate consumed, and Δ H R , 2 as the amount of energy released/consumed by the cyclization reaction per mole of GVL produced. The heat release in RC1 ( Q R C 1 ) includes the heat release from step 1 ( Q 1 ) and step 2 ( Q 2 ) as these two steps occur consecutively. In calorimeter C80, it is possible to measure only the heat of reaction 2 in the absence of hydrogen and Ru/C catalyst. The energy equations are shown below: (1) Q R C 1 = ∫ t = 0 t - R 1 × V × Δ H 1 - R 2 × V × Δ H 2 . d t = Q 1 + Q 2 (2) Q C 80 = ∫ t = 0 t - R 2 × V × Δ H 2 . d t = Q 2 where, Q 1 and Q 2 represent the heat of reactions 1 and 2, respectively; R 1 and R 2 represent the reaction rates 1 and 2; Δ H 1 and Δ H 2 represent the reaction enthalpies 1 and 2, respectively. Instead of measuring the reaction rates, one can consider the material balance for the substrate: (3) n S u b s , 0 = n S u b s ( t ) + n I n t ( t ) + n G V L ( t ) - n G V L , 0 The heat release from step 1 ( Q 1 ) depends on the first reaction enthalpy and mole conversion of substrate ML or BL (Eq. (4)). The heat release of Q 2 depends on the second reaction enthalpy and conversion of the intermediate to GVL (Eq. (5)). (4) Q 1 = - ( n S u b s , 0 - n S u b s , f i n a l ) × Δ H R , 1 (5) Q 2 = + n G V L , 0 - n G V L , f i n a l × Δ H R , 2 From Eqs. (1) and (2), one can obtain the equations for the calculation of reaction enthalpy: (6) Δ H R , 2 = + Q C 80 n G V L , 0 - n G V L , f i n a l (7) Δ H R , 1 = Q R C 1 - n G V L , 0 - n G V L , f i n a l × Δ H R , 2 - n S u b s , 0 - n S u b s , f i n a l As in C80 experiment, only step 2 occurs so the reaction enthalpy for the second step ( Δ H R , 2 ) can be calculated firstly. Then by using the value of Δ H R , 2 , the reaction enthalpy for the first reaction ( Δ H R , 1 ) can be obtained. 3.1.1 RC1 results Fig. 3 shows the evolution of the heat flow rate released by the reactions for the hydrogenation of ML and BL under isothermal conditions at 130°C. The time zero was set when the stirring was started. By integrating the peak area from time 0 to the end of the experiment, the total energy released ( Q R C 1 ) from this reaction can be obtained (Table 4 ). The reaction mixture before and after experiments were analyzed by GC (Table 4). From the material balance analysis, no side reactions were noticed. The conversion of ML was total but not the conversion of MHP to GVL. One can notice that the kinetics for the BL system was slower. Globally, these reaction systems are exothermic, and the total energy released per GVL produced by the ML system is higher than for the BL system in absolute value (Table 6). 3.1.2 C80 results Before the C80 rotation in measurement cell, the reaction mixture in the open tube comprised substrates, intermediates, alcohols and GVL; and the outside container comprised GVL and sulfuric acid to catalyze the cyclization reaction. The time zero is when the C80 starts to rotate. The cyclization reaction is endothermic as illustrated by Fig. 4 . By integrating the heat flow rate peak, the total energy absorbed by the reaction can be calculated. Table 5 shows the results of the C80 calorimeter. From Table 5, one can notice that the energy absorbed by the second reaction is slightly higher for the MHP cyclization than for the BHP cyclization. The reaction enthalpy 2 for ML system is +7 kJ/mol, and for BL system is +6.5kJ/mol. From Eq. (7), one can find that the values of reaction enthalpy 1 for ML is -53.25kJ/mol and -38.66kJ/mol for BL. Table 6 summarizes the different reaction enthalpy. One can conclude that reaction 1, i.e., hydrogenation, governs the reaction temperature of this system. The hydrogenation enthalpy for the ML system is higher than the one for the BL system. This observation shows that the substituent plays a role not only on the kinetics (Wang et al., 2019) but also on the thermodynamics."
8,Thermal risk assessment,"3.2 Thermal risk assessment The aim of this section is not to develop a detailed kinetic model based on adiabatic experiments but to calculate various thermal risk parameters such as TD24, TD8, TMRad(Tp), and ΔTad as accurately as possible instead of the zero-order model (Vernières-Hassimi et al., 2017). The parameter TMRad(Tp) is the time to reach the maximum rate from the initial temperature Tp, and is obtained from the derivative of the reaction temperature. The parameters TD24 and TD8 are the initial temperatures to get TMRad of 24 and 8h, respectively. The parameter ΔTad corresponds to the difference between the final and initial temperatures. For the sake of clarity, Fig. 5 illustrates the values of these parameters. As already noted, it is the hydrogenation reaction that determines the reaction temperature, since the second enthalpy of the reaction is very low. Therefore, this second reaction can be neglected for the kinetic model under adiabatic conditions, and the reaction rate takes the following form: (8) R 1 = k 1 × S u b s t r a t e l i q × P H 2 × ω C a t . As it was observed in the previous study of our group (Wang et al., 2019), the kinetics of hydrogen mass transfer is faster than the ones of the chemical reaction. Hence, the concentration of hydrogen in the bulk liquid phase is assumed to be the same as the one at the gas-liquid interface. The material balance equations for substrate and intermediate in the autoclave are then simply represented as: (9) d s u b s t r a t e d t = - R 1 (10) d i n t e r m e d i a t e d t = R 1 while the heat balance equation for the liquid phase is: (11) d T R d t = - R 1 × Δ H R 1 × V m R × C P R + m i n s e r t × C p i n s e r t The term m R × C P R was evaluated by m R × w s u b s , 0 × C p s u b s T R + w G V L , 0 × C p G V L T R , where w s u b s , 0 and w G V L , 0 are the initial mass fraction of the substrates and GVL. The variation of the specific heat capacity with temperature was taken into account. According to the manufacturer, the term heat capacity of the insert is 52J/K. A modified Arrhenius equation was used to decrease the correlation between the pre-exponential factor and activation energy: (12) k 1 T = k 1 T R e f × e x p - E a R × 1 T - 1 T R e f As mentioned, reaction temperatures and the hydrogen pressures in the autoclave were monitored online during the hydrogenation process. Based on the standard least-squares method, the predictions of developed model equations (Eqs 8–12) with appropriate boundary conditions were then fitted to the online measured reaction temperature, where the rate constants at a reference temperature (Tref) and activation energies served as fitting parameters. The software ModEst was used to estimate the kinetic constant of the first reaction for the ML and BL system (Haario, 2001). ODESSA, which uses the backward difference method, solved the ordinary differential equations. A Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used to optimize the objective function, defined as (13) ω = ∑ i y i - y ˆ i 2 where, y i is the experimental reaction temperature value and y ˆ i is the simulated one. Fig. 6 shows the fit of the model to the experimental temperature. One can conclude that the model can predict the temperature evolution. Table 7 displays the values of the estimated parameters and the standard deviation. The values of the standard deviation are very low. However, there is a strong correlation between the rate constant at 130°C and the activation energy, i.e., 0.992. This strong correlation might be due to the simplified kinetic model used. The coefficient of determination was found to be equal to 98.92 % for the modeling of BL hydrogenation under adiabatic mode. Fig. 6 shows the fit of the model to the experimental temperature. One can conclude that the model can predict the temperature evolution. Table 8 displays the values of the estimated parameters and the standard deviation. The values of the standard deviation are very low. However, there is a strong correlation between the rate constant at 130°C and the activation energy, i.e., 0.998. Fig. 7 show the high reliability of both models. One can notice that the kinetics of ML hydrogenation is faster than BL hydrogenation, as it was demonstrated in previous articles (Negahdar et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Based on this model, it is possible to estimate different thermal risk parameters under the same operating conditions as described in Table 9 . By using the criteria defined in the article by Wang et al. (2018), both reaction systems present a medium thermal risk with the operating conditions of Table 2. Even if for BL system, the TMRad(100°C) value gives a probable risk and ΔTad value gives a medium severity, one should keep in mind that this reaction system is under hydrogen pressure. Further information can be provided by calculating the values of TD24 and TD8. These parameters represent the initial temperature under adiabatic mode to reach the fastest temperature rate in 24h and 8h. One should notice that the values of these parameters are lower than 100°C. The classical temperature for this reaction system can be up to 160°C under isothermal conditions. Hence, safety barriers, such as an additional cooling system, must be added in the case of thermal runaway."
9,Conclusions,"In this study, thermal risk assessment for the production of γ-valerolactone (GVL) from the hydrogenation of methyl levulinate (ML) and butyl levulinate (BL) over Ru/C was carried out. To achieve this goal, the reaction enthalpies were measured, and kinetic models were developed based on experiments performed under adiabatic conditions. For that, two types of calorimeters were used: Mettler Toledo RC1 and Setaram Tian-Calvet C80. Hydrogenation of alkyl levulinates over Ru/C is a two-step reaction: hydrogenation and cyclization. It was experimentally found that the overall reaction is exothermic. The hydrogenation reaction enthalpy was calculated to be -53.25kJ/mol for the ML hydrogenation and -38.66kJ/mol for the BL hydrogenation. These values confirm the exothermic behavior of the first reaction step. The cyclization reaction enthalpy was measured to be +7 kJ/mol for the ML system and +6.5kJ/mol for the BL system. These values show that this second reaction step is endothermic, and it is negligible compared to the hydrogenation step. Adiabatic experiments in RC1 calorimeter were performed with the following operating conditions: initial substrate concentration of ca. 4.5mol/L, dry basis catalyst loading of 5.4 × 10−3 kg/L, and initial reaction temperature of 100°C. It was found that the thermal risk for both systems can be considered as a medium for such operating conditions based on TMRad and ΔTad. Safety barriers must be implemented for such a reaction system to decrease the risk of thermal runaway. A further investigation is to evaluate the optimum operating conditions to find a compromise between safety and productivity."
