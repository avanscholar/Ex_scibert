0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of global economy, energy requirement is more and more urgent. Nowadays, global energies are almost sourced from fossil fuels (Das and Veziroglu, 2001). Since fossil energy reserves are pollution-carrying and limited resources, it is very important for the exploration of clean and renewable substitutes (Wang et al., 2001). H2 is known as an ideal, clean and renewable energy carrier. As early as the middle-1970s, many countries have paid much attention on the usage of H2 (Levin et al., 2004), and many methods have been applied to produce H2, including thermocatalytic reforming of H2-rich organic compound, electrolysis of water and biological processes (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002). Among these methods, bio-hydrogen production is more attractive because it is environment friendly and low cost (Lin et al., 2006). Bio-hydrogen is divided into two categories, photosynthetic and anaerobic fermentative H2 production, the later seems much more feasible for practical application because of the simple and convenient experimental operation. More importantly, almost any kinds of biomass can be used as fermentation substrates, which promote both waste treatment and energy recovery (Levin et al., 2004). In this work, apple pomace (AP) was chosen as the substrate. Every year about 100 milliontons of AP is produced in China and most of them are abandoned as wastes without deep processing (Feng et al., 2010). Since AP is rich in simple sugar, reducing sugar and hemicelluloses, etc., it is an ideal substrate for anaerobic fermentation (Jaime et al., 2008). The anaerobic fermentative H2 production has two culture patterns, pure culture and mixed culture. Pure culture with single kind of hydrogen-producing bacteria as the inoculum is very difficult to be applied in practical because the yield is very low and the H2 production rate is not stable (Mohan et al., 2008). Compared to the pure culture, mixed culture has many advantages of high H2 production rate, feasibility in reactor design and being much more stable during the fermentative process. Therefore, the current researches are mainly focusing on mixed culture (Wang et al., 2010). Mixed anaerobic fermentative H2 production contains three main steps, pretreatment of sludge, pretreatment of substrate and anaerobic fermentative process. While the studies of pretreatment of biomass substrate mainly concentrate on how to convert lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses to reducing sugars that can be used to produce H2 by H2-producing bacteria (Wang and Wan, 2008). At present, the main pretreatment reagents for substrate pretreatment are HCl, ammonia and cellulase, etc. The effects of various pretreatment methods have been systematically investigated, and an optimal method for the substrate pretreatment can be summarized according to the maximum cumulative H2 production (CHPm) and the average H2 production rate (AHPR) of each method (Mohan et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010; Wang and Wan, 2008; Li et al., 2008). In contrast, there are few studies on the pretreatment of natural sludge. Some researches on the natural sludge by boiling pretreatment for a few minutes to eliminate the negative effects of methanogens were reported (Li et al., 2008; Baghchehsaraee et al., 2008). However, high temperature can also kill the beneficial microorganisms that play a positive role in the anaerobic fermentative process. In order to find out an optimal method to pretreat the sludge, a series of batch experiments have been designed to investigate the effects of ultraviolet and ultrasonic pretreatments of the sludge on H2 production in this work, and the optimal method was evaluated by CHPm and AHPR. In addition, bio-H2 production experiments from AP fermentation system micro-added with various organic acids were studied by using the pretreated sludge as seed under the above optimal condition. Since different kinds of acids had different impacts on H2 production (Li et al., 2008; Baghchehsaraee et al., 2008), the fermentation mechanism can be suggested through analyzing the obtained results. It is expected that some information concerning the effects of sludge pretreatments on bio-H2 production can be obtained, and the fermentative mechanism due to the effect of micro-addition of various organic acids to the fermentative AP on bio-H2 production can be proposed to find a better condition for bio-H2 production from AP."

3,Pretreatment of substrate,"2.2 Pretreatment of substrate AP used in this work was obtained from Xi’an juice factory. The main components were analyzed and the results were as follows: reducing sugar, 13.52%; cellulose, 16.91%; lignin, 24.11%; and hemicelluloses, 20.00%. Prior to use, AP was crumbled into powder and screened with 80-mesh sieve. All batch experiments took 1.5g of the AP powder as substrate. Before being used in fermentative experiments, the 1.5g AP powder was immersed in 20ml 0.6 (w/w)% HCl for 2h, and then dried it in the oven (70°C) for another 2h. Subsequently, the AP was put into 20ml water for fermentation, in which the pH was adjusted to 5.0."
4,Pretreatment of sludge,"2.3 Pretreatment of sludge The sludge used in the batch experiments was collected from the Xi’an Chuangye sewage treatment plant. The sludge was pretreated by the following two methods: Method 1, 30g of sludge was irradiated by ultraviolet lamp (25w) for 0, 5, 10, 15 and 30min. Method 2, 30g of sludge was pretreated in the ultrasonic cleaner for 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60min."
5,Batch experiments,"2.4 Batch experiments Four series of batch experiments were conducted in 150ml three-necked flasks that were numbered as series I, II, III and IV. Experiments in series I were designed to investigate the effect of ultraviolet (UV) time of the sludge on H2 production from fermentative AP. An optimal UV pretreatment time of 15min for the sludge was obtained from series I. Experiments in series II were conducted to examine the effect of the ultrasonic (US) time of the sludge on H2 production. An optimal US pretreatment time of 30min was observed in series II. Series III investigated the results of bio-H2 production from the pretreated AP under the optimal substrate pretreatment condition by fermentation using the sludge irradiated by UV for 15min as inoculant. The optimal substrate pretreatment condition was that the AP was soaked in ammonia liquor of 6% for 24h at room temperature, and the pretreated AP was denoted as AAP (Feng et al., 2010). Series IV, further investigated the effect of various organic acids on H2 production from AP pretreated by HCl under the optimum sludge condition obtained in this work. In all batches, the reactor was filled with 100ml mixture of pretreated sludge, substrate and nutrient stock solution, and then the reactor was sealed and incubated with continuous stirring at a constant temperature of 37°C. The biogas was detected in every 30min, and recorded the gas composition. Here is the constituent of nutrient solution per liter: tryptone, 4000mg; beef extract, 2000mg; yeast extract, 1000mg; NaCl, 4000mg; KH2PO4, 1500mg; K2HPO4, 1000mg; L-cysteine, 500mg; FeSO4·7H2O, 100mg; sodium citrate, 20mg; NiCl·6H2O, 10mg; Va, 2500units; Vd2,250 units; Vb1, 2mg; Vb2, 1mg; niacinamide, 1mg. After fermentation, the residual liquid in the reactor was examined by GC to analysis the concentrate of volatile fatty acids and alcohol."
6,Analyses,"2.5 Analyses The volume of biogas was measured using water displacement method. The composition of the mixed biogas was analyzed by the GC, since only H2 and CO2 were detected from the biogas products, and the peak area is in direct proportion to the concentration of each component, so the H2 production and H2 percentage could be calculated as the following formulas: Hydrogen production ( mlg - 1 -TS ) = ∑ i = 1 n V i × ω i m TS Average production hydrogen rate ( mlg - 1 -TS ) = ∑ i = 1 n V i × ω i m TS t where Vi stands for the water volume which was drained between i=n−1 and i=n measurement, m TS is the mass of total solid (TS), t is the total reaction time, and ωi is the H2 percentage in the mixing biogas at t time."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effects of activated sludge pretreatments on H2 production,"3.1 Effects of activated sludge pretreatments on H2 production 3.1.1 Effects of ultraviolet pretreatment The effects of the pretreated sludge by ultraviolet at the times of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 30min on the fermentative H2 production are shown in Fig. 1 . In Fig. 1(a), the CHPm increased gradually with the increase of irradiation time in the range of 0–15min, and then decreased with further increasing irradiation time. It is obvious that a maximum CHP of 106.9mlg−1-TS was achieved at the irradiation time of 15min, increasing by 39.2% compared to that of the un-irradiated group (76.8mlg−1-TS). The similar phenomenon was found in Fig. 1(b) that the maximum APHR reached 15.0mlg−1-TSh−1 at 15min. The experiment results might be explained as follows: since UV irradiation has bactericidal action, the continuous UV irradiation could kill the methanogens and other hydrogen-consuming bacteria while H2-producing bacteria survived due to forming spores that were much more stable than bacteria in the time range of 0–15min. But the further increase of UV irradiation time had a negative effect on H2-producing bacteria, which made the bio-H2 production restrained (Sharrer et al., 2005). The results tested by GC also supported this deduction, because in the pretreated groups there was no methane existing in the mixing biogas, but methane was detected in the un-pretreated groups. In conclusion, an optimal ultraviolet pretreatment condition for the activated sludge was to be irradiated for 15min, under which a CHPm of 106.9mlg−1-TS and an AHPRm of 15.0mlg−1-TSh−1 would be obtained from fermentative AP. 3.1.2 Effects of ultrasonic pretreatment Fig. 2 depicts the effect of ultrasonic (US) pretreatment of the sludge on the fermentative H2 production at the time of 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60min. As can be seen from Fig. 2(a), the CHPm initially increased from 76.8mlg−1-TS to 104.4mlg−1-TS with the US time from 0 to 30min, and then decreased to 84.4mlg−1-TS at 45min, finally increased to 93.0mlg−1-TS again when the US time was extended to 60min. The similar changes in AHPR also can be observed in Fig. 2(b) that the AHPR increased gradually from 0 to 30min, and then decreased slowly with the prolongation of US time. An AHPRm of 18.4mlg−1-TSh−1 was also obtained at the US pretreatment time of 30min. The cause for it may be that, on the one hand, the US pretreatment of sludge could smash the coenobium and increase the interaction between H2-producing bacteria and substrate which favors the production of hydrogen; on the other hand, the US pretreatment also could severely inhibit the activity of bacteria in the sludge, including the H2-producing ones. However, the H2-producing bacteria are Gram-positive clostridia that are less vulnerable than other bacteria by US wave. This is because that they not only have thick cell wall but also can form spores when they are in bad condition (Zhang and Liu, 1995; Liu et al., 2009). Therefore, although the US wave had a negative influence on both H2-producing bacteria and other hydrogen-consuming bacteria, the most of the H2-producing ones could survive when the US time was not too long. Nevertheless, if further prolonged US time, US wave could destroy the spores. As a result, CHPm increased from 76.8mlg−1-TS to 104.4mlg−1-TS and AHPR rose from 11.4mlg−1-TSh−1 to 18.4mlg−1-TSh−1 from 0 to 30min, and subsequently decreased in the range of 30–45min. A CHPm of 104.4mlg−1-TS and an AHPR of 18.4mlg−1-TSh−1 was obtained at the US pretreatment time of 30min, thus the optimal pretreatment time for the sludge by US was 30min. It is apparent that the optimal US pretreatment time varies for different fermentative conditions due to using different bacteria as inoculum. While the clostridia are abounding in our local environment and have an effective bio-H2 competence (Jo et al., 2008). So the results in this work could be applied in the systems that use clostridia as the inoculum source."
9,Bio-hydrogen production from AAP by fermentation using the pretreated sludge by ultraviolet for 15min,"3.2 Bio-hydrogen production from AAP by fermentation using the pretreated sludge by ultraviolet for 15min In this section, a fermentative experiment was carried out to investigate the bio-H2 production from the pretreated AAP by fermentation using the sludge pretreated by ultraviolet for 15min as seed. The corresponding results are presented in Fig. 3 and Table 1 . Fig. 3 shows the change of the cumulative H2 production (CHP) and pH value with time. As can seen from Fig. 3, the maximum cumulative H2 production (CHPm) reached 138.8mlg−1-TS, increased by 80.7% compared to that of the un-irradiated group (76.8mlg−1-TS). Meanwhile, in order to confirm the stability of fermentative H2 production, three repeated fermentation experiments were carried out, and the results are summarized in Table 1. It is obvious from Table 1 that the H2 production under the optimal substrate and sludge pretreatment are quite stable. An average CHPm of 137.4mlg−1-TS was obtained from the three repeated experiments."
10,Effects of micro-addition of organic acids on H2 production,"3.3 Effects of micro-addition of organic acids on H2 production The mechanism of H2 production by anaerobic fermentation has been systemically studied by many researchers, and according to their results, there are many kinds of organic acids to be produced during the fermentation process (Li et al., 2008). In this part, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of those organic acids (acetic, lactic, propionic and butyric) on H2 production by adding 1ml each of them into the reaction system, and the sludge was pretreated by the UV lamp for 15min as mentioned above. Fig. 4 shows the effects of micro-addition of different organic acids on the H2 production from AP by fermentation. The effect of micro-addition of ethanol on H2 production was also studied, and the result was shown in Fig. 4 for comparison with the system of addition of the organic acid. It is apparent from Fig. 4 that a maximum CHP of 138.9mlg−1-TS could be obtained when lactic acid was added into the reaction system, increased by 36.8% compared to CHPm (101.5mlg−1-TS) produced in the none-addition system. The addition of propanoic acids could also increase CHP, while the addition of ethanol, acetic acid and butyric acid decreased CHP in contrast with the none-addition system. As far as AHPR in Fig. 4 are concerned, the largest AHPR (15.7mlg−1 TS/h) also occurred in the system of addition of lactic acid. The metabolic pathways of the five liquid products (lactic acid, propionic acid, ethanol, acetic acid and butyric acid) described in reference can explain the result (Ren et al., 2006; Jo et al., 2008). Theoretically, the fermentative H2 can be produced from substrate fermentation with ethanol, acetic acid or butyric acid as liquid end-product. But there is no hydrogen production when the end-product is lactic acid or propionic acid. Therefore, from the viewpoint of equilibrium remove, the addition of ethanol, acetic acid or butyric acid will inhibit bio-H2 production. While the addition of lactic acid or propionic acid will favor the H2 production because of promoting metabolic pathway of pyruvic acid (CH3COCOOH→CH3COSCoA+CO2 +H2) (Ren et al., 2006). This may be the reason why the addition of lactic acid or propionic acid can increase hydrogen production."
11,Conclusions,"A series of batch experiments were conducted to study the effect of sludge pretreatment on bio-H2 production. An optimal pretreatment condition for the sludge was suggested that the sludge was irradiated by UV lamp (25w) for 15min. Under the optimal sludge pretreatment condition, a CHPm of 138.8mlg−1-TS was obtained by AAP fermentation. Furthermore, the effect of micro-addition of various organic acids on the bio-H2 production was also systematically investigated under the optimal sludge pretreatment condition, and a CHPm of 138.9mlg−1-TS was obtained when lactic acid was added into the reaction system."
