0,Introduction,"Visible light-driven photocatalysts have been extensively investigated during the past few decades from the point view of hydrogen production via water splitting under solar radiation [1–5]. Among the various kinds of photocatalyst, metallic oxide, especially TiO2, is most widely studied because of its chemical stability, nontoxicity and high photocatalytic activity [6,7]. However, some shortcomings such as low solar efficiency hinder its extensive application. Compared to metallic oxide, sulfides, which have narrow band gaps (BGs) and valence bands at relatively negative potentials compared to oxides, can be good candidates for visible-light-driven photocatalysts due to the hybridization of O2p and S3p orbitals [8–12]. Ternary sulfides semiconductors with the general formula AIBIIIC2 IV (A = Cu, Ag; B In, Ga; C S, Se, Te) are widely studied due to their large potential in solar-cell, light-emitting diodes, nonlinear optical applications and photocatalytic fields [13–16]. Therefore, many efforts have been focused on this system in the past years, and AIBIIIC2 IV materials with different compositions and/or shapes have been synthesized via different methods. For example, CuInS2 [17–20] and AgInS2 [21–24] nanocrystals with various shapes (including particles, rods, and worms) have been prepared through wet-chemistry progress assisted by various surfactants or ligands. Recently, monodispersed pyramidal CuInS2 and rectangular AgInS2 colloids were also successfully synthesized [25–27]. Silver thiogallate (AgGaS2) was chosen as the studying target because it was one of the important members in the large family of AIBIIIC2 IV compounds with the band gap of 2.7 eV [28,29]. Usually, AgGaS2 is also synthesized by solid state reaction (SSR), vacuum evaporation, and hydrothermal/solvothermal reaction method. However, the as-synthesized compounds often show irregular shape or small surface area, which may hinder the future application. Although AgGaS2 is considered to be a good candidate of visible-light harvesting material, the photocatalytic hydrogen generation properties are less than satisfactory because the unsuitable band structures. Moreover, there is not much work on water splitting by ternary sulfide photocatalysts. Based on the above statements, we chose AgGaS2 as the studying system and modulate the band structure by substitution of indium into the Ga site in the AgGaS2 lattice for the building of ternary sulfide photocatalysts AgGa1−x In x S2, considering that the formation of solid solution is benefit for photocatalyts [10,30–32]. Meanwhile, long chain alcohol (pentanol and heptanol) is chosen as addition agent on the for the sake of morphology control. It is found that the obtained products show unique hierarchical micro-architectures which were fabricated by micro-sphere and nano-sheets and the rate of hydrogen evolution reached up to 813 μmol/h."
1,Experimental sections,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation The ternary sulfide photocatalysts AgGa1−x In x S2 powders were prepared using a simple hydrothermal method. All materials were purchased from commercial sources (analytical grade) and used without further purified. In a typical synthesis, 0.06 mmol thioacetamide (TAA) was dissolved in deionized water. 0.015 mmol AgNO3, 0.015 mmol Ga(NO3)3 or In(NO3)3were then added dropwise into the above solution under constant stirring. After stirring for 30 min, 2 mL of long chain alcohol (pentanol or heptanol) was added into the solution. The reaction mixture was transferred into an autoclave (Teflon cups with 20 mL inner volume) and the compactedness was adjusted to 80%. The autoclave was maintained at 180 °C for 24 h and then air-cooled to room temperature. The product was collected by centrifugation, washed 5 times with absolute ethanol, and finally dried in oven at 50 °C."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The structure of photocatalysts was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on Rigaku D/max-2000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The morphology of the products was observed by a Camscan MX2600FE field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM).UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were acquired by a spectrophotometer (TU-1900) and BaSO4 was used as the reflectance standard. The photocatalytic hydrogen generation test was performed in a gas-closed circulation system with a side quartz window. The photocatalyst powder was pre-dispersed by ultrasonication for 30 min in an aqueous solution (320 mL) containing Na2SO3 (1.2 mol L−1) and Na2S (0.1 mol L−1) as electron donors. The reaction was carried out by irradiating the mixture with light from a Xe lamp (Trusttech PLS-SXE 300W, Beijing) which was equipped with an optical filter (λ > 400 nm) to cut off the light in the ultraviolet region. The amount of produced H2was measured by gas chromatography (Agilent 6820) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and Ar as the carrier gas."
4,Calculation method,"2.3 Calculation method The electronic band-structure calculation was based on the full-potential linear muffin tin orbital (FP-LMTO) method [33], which uses the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) PW91 [34], an improvement of the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) within DFT [35] that is known to be an efficient and accurate scheme for solving the many-electron problem of a crystal. The density of the Monkhorst-Packk-point mesh are 2 × 2 × 1. The absorption curves can be obtained from the imaginary part of the dielectric constant from DFT calculation. The kinetic energy cut-off was set at 350 eV, and the system structures were first optimized by first-principle calculations. The convergence parameters were as follows: SCF energy tolerance 5 × 10−7 eV/atom, maximum force 0.01 eV, and maximum stress component 0.02 GPa."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Crystal structure and morphology,"3.1 Crystal structure and morphology It is known that the ternary sulfide AIBIIIC2 IV semiconductors crystallize in the chalcopyrite structure. It belongs to the family type compounds which crystallize in the tetragonal space group D12 2d with four formula units in each cell, and they have a chalcopyrite structure that is closely related to those of zinc blende and wurtzite structures. This kind of structure shows similar arrangement of anions but differs in the ordered distribution of the cations which makes the unit cell tetragonal with the c-axis about twice the a-axis of the zinc blende type unit cell. Each anion is coordinated by two A and B cations, while each anion is tetrahedrally coordinated by four anions, as shown in Fig. 1 . The atom positions of this kind of ternary sulfide AIBIIIC2 IV semiconductors can be indicated as follows: A (0, 0, 0), (0, 0.5, 0.5); B (0.5, 0.5, 0); (0.5, 0, 0.25), C (u, 0.25, 0.125); (−u, 0.75, 0.125); (0.75, u, 0.875); (0.25, −u, 0.875). The value of u represents that the anions are displaced from their ideal tetrahedral sites and can be given by the Equation (1): (1) u = 1 2 − [ c 2 32 a 2 − 1 16 ] 1 2 where the a and c stand for the geometrical parameters. In our case, a = 5.587 Å and c = 10.4086 Å according to the result of XRD analysis and theory calculation, as shown in Fig. 1, indicating that the value of u is 0.286 based on Equation (1). Meanwhile, the geometrical parameter η = c/2a is less than 1, and the reason for this distortion is caused by second neighbor interactions. We have also characterized the XRD patterns of AgGa1−x In x S2with different values of x (x = 0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.8, 1) and magnified the strongest peak, as shown in Fig. S1. As shown, along with the increase of x, the shift in the 2θ angle of diffraction is expected due to the lattice expansion, considering that the smaller ionic radii of In3+ (0.80 Å) and Ga3+(0.62 Å) ions. Fig. S2 shows the relationship between lattice constants (c) and In concentration (x). The value of c increases almost linearly with increasing In concentration (x), (Vegard's law is generally obeyed) suggesting a solid solution behavior. To investigate the influence of long chain alcohol (pentanol and heptanol) on the morphology of AgGa1−x In x S2, FE-SEM characterization was carried out for photocatalysts with and without the introducing of long chain alcohol (pentanol and heptanol). As shown in Fig. 2 , both pentanol and heptanol play a key role for the formation of hierarchical photocatalyst. When pentanol was used as addition agent, the product shows the morphology of micro-sphere with a diameter of about ca. 3–5 μm, as shown in Fig. 2b. The surface of the micro-sphere is composed of numerous nanopores, which might be beneficial for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity, because the nanopores can be considered as active sites [36–38]. Further observation shows that some nanosheets are gathered on the surface of micro-spheres. The thickness of the nanosheets is about 200 nm, and the length-diameter ratio is ca. 4–6. The growth of the nanosheet is supposed to be that the nanopores can be acted as nucleation center where Ostwald ripening can be processed. Compared to Fig. 2b, when no long chain alcohol is introduced to the reaction system, just irregular spheres with diameter ranging from 3 to 8 μm are observed, as seen in Fig. 2a. The corresponding surface area is thus not as large as that of hierarchical (3.8 m2 g−1 and 8.6 m2 g−1 for samples without and with long chain alcohol, respectively). Similar phenomena are found when heptanol is used as additive agent. Fig. 2d shows the FE-SEM image of AgGa1−x In x S2 photocatalyst with the introducing of heptanol. As seen, an interesting hierarchical structure can be observed. The main body of the products maintains the morphology of micro-sphere while the diameter is ca. 5–8 μm which is bigger than that of product synthesized with the addition of pentanol. Most glaring of all, the nanosheets on the surface of micro-sphere are much more obvious and compact. The length-diameter ratio maintains to be ca. 4–6. Thus it is supposed that the longer alkyl chain will promote the formation of nanosheet on the surface of micro-spheres. Furthermore, no nanosheet is observed with the adding of alcohol, as shown in Fig. 2c."
7,Light absorbing and hydrogen evolution properties,"3.2 Light absorbing and hydrogen evolution properties Light absorbing properties are of important for photocatalysts [39,40] because the substitution of indium into the Ga site may result in noteworthy influence the visible light responding. UV–vis spectra of the as-fabricated samples with different amount of In (x value) in AgGa1−x In x S2 were carried out. The band gaps of the as-fabricated x-dependent samples are also investigated. Their band gaps could be determined with the formula αhν = A(hν−E g) n/2,where α, h, ν, A, E g, and n are the absorption coefficient, Planck's constant, the incident light frequency, constant, the band-gap energy, and an integer, respectively. Among them, n depends on the characteristics of the optical transition of the semiconductor, n = 1 for direct transition semiconductors and n = 4 for indirect transition semiconductors. The photocatalyst we studied is a typical kind of direct transition semiconductors and the values of n are defined to be 1. The band-gap energy (E g) of the series photocatalysts with different amount of In introduced is estimated from a plot of (αhν)2 versus the photon energy (hν). As described in Fig. 3 , the E g value gradually decreased along with the increase of x value. Pure AgGaS2 shows a band gap of 2.71 eV, while the band gap decreases to 2.32 eV (x = 0.1), 2.08 eV (x = 0.3), 1.98 eV (x = 0.7). Thus it is believed that the formation of AgGa1−x In x S2 is benefit for the visible light absorbing. Usually, photocatalyst with a small band-gap energy means strong light absorbing and is thus for the enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Photocatalytic performances of series powders are shown in Fig. 4 a. As can be seen, the introducing of long chain alcohol greatly promoted the photocatalytic activities, both for pentanol and heptanol and the effect of heptanol is more obvious. When the value of x is 0.1 and the addition is heptanol, the rate of hydrogen evolution reaches a maximum of 813 μmol/h under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). It is also worth noting that when the value of x further increases, the photocatalytic activity shows a trend of declining. Compared to heptanol, when pentanol is used as the additive alcohol, the photocatalytic activity is 15–25% lower. The reason is suggested to due to the much more obvious and compact nano-sheets formed on the surface of micro-sphere, which will introduce larger surface area and active sites. Thus can be seen, the formation of unique hierarchical structure is beneficial for the enhancement of hydrogen evolution. Compared with the work reported, the activity is much higher [41]. In order to investigate the photo-stability of optimized photocatalyst AgGa1−x In x S2 (x = 1 and heptanol as additive alcohol), a typical reaction time course for H2 evolution from an aqueous Na2SO3/Na2S solution under visible light irradiation is carried out. Three runs were tested and the reaction system was evacuated after each run. As shown in Fig. 4b, the initial average hydrogen evolution rate can reach up to 753 μmol/h during the first run. During the second and third run, the average rate mildly decreases to 714 and 686 μmol/h. The decrease in the rate of hydrogen evolution might be related to the deactivation of the photocatalyst or attributed to the consumption of the sacrificial reagents in the solution [42]."
8,Band gap tailoring and theory calculation,"3.3 Band gap tailoring and theory calculation The electronic configurations for Ag, Ga, In and Sare Ag: Kr4d105s1, Ga: Ar3 d104s24p1, In: Kr4d105s25p1and S: Ne3s23p4, and the subshells of the nobel gas cores are distinguished from the subshells of valence electrons given explicitly. The compounds AIBIIIC2 IV with a chalcopyrite crystal structure differ from the compounds AIIBVI with a sphalerite structure. There are three differences. First, there are two cation sublattices with each CVI anion tetrahedrally coordinated by two AI cations and two BIII cations. Second, the unit cell is tetragonally distorted; the distortion is specified by the distortion parameter η = c/2a≠1. The deviation from unity can reach 12%. Third, the CVI atoms are displaced from the ideal tetrahedral positions in a sphalerite structure (Fig. 1); this displacement may be defined by the u parameter [43]. The band structure of AgGaS2 and AgInS2 based on DFT calculation are shown in Fig. 5 a and b, respectively. The top of the valance bands and the bottom of the conductive bands of AgGaS2 and AgInS2 both locate at G point, indicating that both compounds are direct band gap semiconductors, which is benefit for photocatalysts [44]. We obtain a direct gap of 0.99 eV and 0.67 eV for AgGaS2 and AgInS2, respectively, in agreement with other results reported [41,45]. The smaller calculated band gap obtained from experimental UV–vis spectra is a common feature of DFT calculations [46], also an artifact of the GGA method used for this calculation [47]. Fig. 5c and d show the total densities of states (TDOS) and partial densities of states (PDOS) of AgGaS2 and AgInS2. The qualitative comparison of the DOS of two respective systems implies that valence band is composed of S3p and Ag d orbitals. The top of valence band has a dominant contribution from S3p. The respective conduction band is comprised of Ga/In s, Sp, and Ag s orbitals, the bottom of conduction band being mainly made of Ga/In s orbital. The main difference in the DOS is the effect of In s contribution in narrowing the band gap of AgInS2 compared to AgGaS2. Effectively, we can conclude that the replacement of Ga with indium into the AgGaS2 structure displaces the bottom of conduction band toward the lower energy. Further, we have calculated the band structure and DOS of AgGaS2 which 10% of Ga is substituted by In. The results were shown in Fig. S1. When 10 percent of In was introduced, the band gap was reduced from 0.99 to 0.87 eV, indicating that the hybridization of Ga and In leads to the narrowing of band gap. On the other hand, the band gap of AgGa0.9In0.1S2 is between AgGaS2 and AgInS2, which further confirmed the effect of In. Thus can be seen, the changing of H2production rate on the indium concentration could be due to the tailoring of band structure and light absorbance. When indium is introduced into AgGaS2, it leads to a reduced band gap and thus higher photon absorption compared to that of the original material under the same illumination. However, when x is larger than 0.1, the photocatalytic activity trends to decrease which is proposed to be due to that the position of the conduction band of AgGa1−x In x S2 shifted toward more positive region as schematically shown in Fig. 6 in which the schematic of band structure for AgGaS2, AgG0.9In0.1S2, and AgInS2 from the spectroscopic and the simulated electronic structure studies are proposed. In addition, more diffuse DOS population near the bottom of conduction band of AgInS2 may have hindered the hydrogen evolution [41]."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, visible-light-driven photocatalyst, AgGa1−x In x S2 was prepared by a facile long chain alcohol assisted hydrothermal route. The obtained products show unique hierarchical micro-architectures which were fabricated by micro-sphere and nano-sheets. The introducing of long chain alcohol (pentanol and heptanol) was investigated to be crucial for the forming of hierarchical micro-architectures. On the other hand, the band gap energy of AgGa1−x In x S2 (x = 0–1) estimated from the onset of absorption edge was found to be reduced from 2.71 eV (x = 0) to 1.93 eV (x = 1) by indium substitution. The photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution was investigated under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). The rate of hydrogen evolution reached up to 813 μmol/h."
