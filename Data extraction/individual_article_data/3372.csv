0,Introduction,"The depletion of fossil fuel reserves as well as the environmental and human health problems caused by automotive combustion engines and thermal or nuclear power plants make hydrogen fuel cells an attractive alternative energy source. Fuel cells for mobile and stationary applications operating with pure hydrogen are highly valued because of their high theoretical efficiency and they reject only steam [1–3]. Hydrogen is believed to be the fuel of the future; however, there are many challenges facing the transition from fossil liquid fuels to hydrogen. Hydrogen derived from fossil fuels will be either carbon intensive or expensive because of the carbon sequestration costs [4]. Consequently, hydrogen should be generated from resources that are carbon-neutral and renewable for long-term environmental sustainability. The bioethanol-to-hydrogen system has the significant advantage of being nearly CO2-neutral (CO2 released into the atmosphere during ethanol combustion is absorbed during biomass growth), i.e., there is no net release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [5]. In addition, the advantages of bioethanol in contrast to other alcohols such as methanol, come from the fact that bioethanol is safer to store, handle and transport due to its lower toxicity and volatility. Ethanol can be converted to hydrogen by three different processes: ethanol steam reforming (ESR) [6–10], partial oxidation (POX) [11–14], and auto-thermal steam reforming (ATR) [12,15,16]. The main reason to convert bioethanol to hydrogen instead of directly using bioethanol as a fuel is the dilution of ethanol during direct utilization [17,18] (approximately 13mol H2O/mol C2H5OH) [19]. Additionally, other compounds are generated during the production of bioethanol that are difficult to separate and are not desirable in a combustion process, making it inadvisable to use bioethanol directly in internal combustion engines [17,18]. However, bioethanol can be inexpensively produced from biomass, and producing hydrogen for fuel cells from bioethanol with a large excess of water via steam reforming is believed to be a promising technology [20,21]. This has motivated many investigations focusing on the design of reactors for the production of hydrogen from bioethanol, but less attention has been given to the design of a complete system that includes all the steps involved in the production of hydrogen from bioethanol. The traditional way to evaluate the process performance is based on energy efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of energy produced (output) to the energy supplied (input), but an exergetic analysis provides a true measure of the process performance. Whereas the energy analysis is based on the first law of thermodynamics, the exergy analysis is based on both the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. An exergy analysis is a powerful tool for the design, optimization, and performance evaluation of energy systems [22,23]. The main purpose of an exergy analysis is to identify the causes and to quantitatively estimate the magnitude of the imperfection of a thermal or chemical process [24]. Moreover, an exergy analysis leads to a better understanding of the influence of the thermodynamic parameters on the process efficiency and can help determine the most effective ways to improve the process under consideration [22]. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using both energy and exergy analyses modeling techniques for energy-utilization assessments to maximize the energy savings and hence the environmental and financial savings [24]. In this paper, three processes for the production of hydrogen from bioethanol are modeled to compare their performances and to identify the most suitable thermo-chemical process (ESR, ATR and POX) to convert bioethanol into hydrogen. These performances are evaluated in terms of hydrogen productivity, energy efficiency, exergy destruction, exhaust exergy and exergetic efficiency. The originality of this research lies in the fact that we considered, in a same investigation, three types of processes for hydrogen production via ethanol reforming (ESR, POX and ATR). Moreover the study contains simultaneously (1) reforming reaction investigation, (2) full process simulation (3), energetic study and (4) exergetic analysis. First, the three different processes of hydrogen production from ethanol and the concept of exergy analysis are described. Next, the different ethanol reforming reactors are simulated and investigated to identify the best operating conditions to optimize the hydrogen production. Then, the different hydrogen production processes from ethanol are simulated to evaluate the thermodynamic properties at different process locations. Finally, the energy and exergy analysis methodologies are applied to evaluate and compare the process performances."
1,Steps for ethanol-to-hydrogen production processes,"The main steps for the production of hydrogen from ethanol are given below and are used to model the complete system to produce H2 (see Section 4 below) to compare the exergetic efficiencies of the three different reforming processes. A typical reforming process involves three steps [25,26]: • Generation of a synthesis gas by the reforming reaction (ESR, POX or ATR), • Clean-up of CO performed by the water gas shift reactor (WGS) and the CO preferential oxidation reactor (COPROX), and • Purification. In the first step, a synthesis gas is produced by a reforming reaction. – For the ESR system, the ethanol–steam mixture is catalytically converted to hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane [26]. The reactor operates at temperatures ranging from 823 to 1073K, depending on the catalyst activity and the ethanol/water molar ratio. Nickel, cobalt or metals, such as rhodium and platinum, are proposed as catalysts for this reaction [26–30]. The ESR can be modeled using the following equation: (1) C2H5OH+αH2O→Synthesis Gas where α is the stoichiometric coefficient of water. This reaction is endothermic and requires a large amount of external heat. In this paper, the reactors heat duties (ESR, POX and ATR) are calculated by Aspen Plus™ software but can be, also, computed by quantum chemical methods as described in [31,32]. The equilibrium composition of the synthesis gas depends on the reformer temperature (T) and pressure (P) as well as the initial composition of the ethanol–steam mixture expressed by the steam to carbon molar ratio (S/C) [12]. – The POX system relies on the incomplete oxidation of the feed. The POX process results in a sub-stoichiometric oxidation of the fuel source, fractionating the feed into smaller molecules and generating heat [12]. (2) C2H5OH+β(O2 +3.77N2)→Synthesis Gas (H2, CO, CO2, CH4) where β is the stoichiometric coefficient of air. – The ATR system combines the ESR and POX processes. The POX exothermic reaction produces the heat required to perform the endothermic ESR reaction. Typically, ATR reactions are considered to be thermally self-sustaining and therefore, do not produce or consume external thermal energy [33,34]. (3) C2H5OH+β(O2 +3.77N2)+αH2O→Synthesis Gas. For the POX and ATR systems, the composition of the synthesis gas depends on the reformer temperature (T), pressure (P), and the oxygen to carbon molar ratio (O/C) [12]. For the ATR and ESR systems, the composition is also influenced by the steam to carbon molar ratio (S/C). Rabenstein and Hacker [12] have shown that the major products of the steam–ethanol reforming system (ESR, POX and ATR) are water, hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. Thermodynamically ethanol is fully converted already at low temperatures. Coke formation during catalytic reforming can lead to the deactivation of catalysts, resulting in low durability and activity. This problem is not posed in this paper when all configuration considered are for S/C>3 and T>673K. In fact, in a previous investigation, Rabenstein and Hacker [12] have shown that coke is absent at temperatures above 523K and the S/C above 3. Therefore, carbon (coke) and ethanol are excluded from the component list as plausible product and the synthesis gas component was restricted to H2O, H2, CH4, CO and CO2 [12,25]. In the second step, the synthesis gas produced in the reformer is passed through a water gas shift (WGS) reactor that converts the CO to CO2 and H2 using the available H2O in the synthesis gas or additional H2O that is supplied to the system [26,35–38]. Herein, the following reaction occurs: (4) CO + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 Δ H ° 298 = − 41 kJ . mol − 1 . In practice, the water gas shift reaction takes place over the two reactors: the high temperature shift reactor (HTS), which operates between 473–673K, and the low temperature shift reactor, which operates between 400–450K [35,36]. The gas leaving the WGS reactor is then mixed with oxygen and air before entering the COPROX reactor. In this reactor, the remaining CO is oxidized to CO2, but hydrogen is also oxidized [26]. (5) CO+0.5 O2 →CO2 (6) H2 +0.5 O2 →H2O. Reaction (6) must be avoided as much as possible because hydrogen is consumed, but this reaction is thermodynamically favored because the hydrogen concentration in the mixture entering the reactor is clearly higher than the CO concentration. For this reason, the catalyst used should be highly selective w.r.t reaction (5) [26]. The final step is the separation of the hydrogen from the synthesis gas stream exiting the COPROX reactor. This separation process can be accomplished using several techniques. The three most common methods are as follows: (1) pressure-swing-adsorption (PSA) to separate the H2, (2) PSA to separate the CO2 followed by condensation of the remaining H2O, and (3) membrane separation of the H2 [36]."
2,Energetic and exergetic performances of the processes,"The bases of the exergy analysis are described below and will be used in the analysis of the H2 production processes described in Section 4. The process performance is traditionally evaluated by the thermal efficiency, based on the first law of thermodynamics. The thermal efficiency is the ratio of the energy output divided by the energy input. For a hydrogen production process, this thermal efficiency is given by Eq. (7) [35,36]: (7) η Thermal = m H 2 ⋅ LH V H 2 / m C 2 H 5 OH ⋅ LH V C 2 H 5 OH + W compressors + W pumps where mi and LHVi are the mass flow and the lower heating value of component “i”, respectively, and Wi is the mechanical work of engine “i”. The exergy analysis focuses on the exergy flows in a system to identify where exergy is destroyed or wasted. For a control volume of any system at steady-state conditions, the exergy destruction rate is calculated from the exergy balance as [36]: (8) Exdestruction =Exin −Exout where Exin and Exout are the total exergy flows entering and leaving the system, respectively. The unused exergy is defined as the sum of the destroyed exergy within the system and the exergy wasted in the exhaust stream. In this study, the exhaust stream is the stream of the waste gases. (9) Exunused =Exdestruction +Exexhaust. The exergetic efficiency of the system is given by Eq. (10): (10) h Exergy = 1 − E x unused / E x in . The “m”th component of the exergy destruction is then given by Eq. (11): (11) E x destruction , m = S m E x in , m − S m E x out , m . Three forms of the exergy transfer are distinguished here: with work, with the heat interaction and with the mass flow. Other components of the exergy transfer are neglected, such as potential and kinetic exergies. The exergy associated with the heat interaction is given by Eq. (12) [22]: (12) E x Q = Q 1 − T 0 / T where T 0 is the reference temperature, T is the temperature at which the heat transfer takes place and Q is the heat transferred. The exergy associated with the work exchange is [22]: (13) E x W = W . The exergy associated with the mass flow is divided into chemical (Exchem), physical (Exphys) and mixing exergy (Exmix) and is given by Eq. (14): (14) E x M = E x phys + E x chem + E x mix . Physical exergy is the work obtainable by taking the substance through reversible processes from its initial state temperature T and pressure P, to the state determined by the temperature T 0 and the pressure P 0 of the environment. It is given by Eq. (15) [39] (15) E x phys = Δ actual state-ref state D ⋅ x l ∑ i = 1 n x i H i l − T 0 ∑ i = 1 n x i S i l + x v ∑ i = 1 n y i H i v − T 0 ∑ i = 1 n y i S i v in which n is the number of chemical species in a material stream, D is the molar flow rate, xl and xv are the liquid mole fraction and vapor mole fraction in material stream, respectively; xi and yi are the mole fraction of species i in liquid phase and vapor phase, respectively; and Hi and Si are the molar enthalpy and molar entropy of pure component i, respectively. The superscripts l and v refer to liquid and vapor phase, respectively. The chemical exergy is equal to the maximum amount of work obtainable when the substance under consideration is brought from the environmental state, defined by the parameters T 0 and P 0, to the reference state by processes involving heat transfer and exchange of substances only with the environment. This is given by Eq. (16) [39]: (16) E x chem = D ⋅ x 0 , l ∑ i = 1 n x 0 , i ⋅ ε chem , i 0 l + x 0 , v ∑ i = 1 n y 0 , i ⋅ ε chem , i 0 v . ε 0l chem,i and ε 0v chem,i denote the standard chemical exergy of any species i in liquid and vapor phase, respectively. The chemical exergies of process components are evaluated using the reference environment model defined by Szargut [22]. The mixing exergy, which always has a negative value, is given by Eq. (17) [39] (17) E x mix = Δ mix H − T 0 Δ mix S at T P with (18) Δ mix H = D ⋅ x l H l − ∑ i = 1 n x i H i l + x v H v − ∑ i = 1 n y i H i v (19) Δ mix S = D ⋅ x l S l − ∑ i = 1 n x i S i l + x v S v − ∑ i = 1 n y i S i v . H l(v) and S l(v) denote the enthalpy and the entropy of the mixture in liquid phase (vapor)."
3,Reforming reactors operating parameters,"Before applying the energy and exergy analyses to the H2 production processes, the three types of reforming reactions were simulated to investigate the influence of the operating parameters. This study enabled the optimal operating parameters to be chosen for the simulation of the complete H2 production processes. The values of the operating parameters for the reformer must be chosen to maximize hydrogen production while minimizing the methane and carbon monoxide concentrations in the synthesis gas. Methane is not converted into H2 in the WGS reactor; therefore, higher levels of methane result in lower hydrogen yields. Moreover, the presence of methane in the synthesis gas indicates that other by-products, such as ethylene, have also been formed [33]. It is also important to reduce the carbon monoxide concentration in the synthesis gas to reduce the required size of the gas-cleaning unit. The synthesis gas composition was determined by simulations to minimize the Gibbs free energy using the Aspen Plus™ software (Aspen Technology, Inc., Burlington, MA, USA). This model is preferred in fuel-reforming analysis [38,40,41]. The total Gibbs free energy (Gt ) of a system is given by Eq. (20): (20) G t = ∑ i = 1 N n i G i ¯ = ∑ i = 1 N n i μ i = ∑ i = 1 N n i G i 0 + RT ∑ i = 1 N n i ln f i f i 0 where G i ¯ the partial molar Gibbs free energy of species i, Gi 0 the standard Gibbs free energy, μ i the chemical potential, R the molar gas constant, T the temperature of system, P the pressure of system, fi the fugacity in system, fi 0 the standard-state fugacity, and ni the mole of species i. For reaction equilibrium in gas-phase f i = y i ϕ i ¯ P , f i 0 = P 0 and G i 0 =ΔG fi 0. Using the Lagrange multiplier method, the minimum Gibbs free energy of each gaseous species and that of the total system can be expressed as Eqs. (21) and (22), respectively. (21) Δ G fi 0 + RT ln y i ϕ i ¯ P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a ik = 0 (22) ∑ i = 1 N n i Δ G fi 0 + RT ln y i ϕ i ¯ P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a ik = 0 where δgfi 0 is the standard Gibbs function of formation of species i, P 0 the standard-state pressure of 101.3kPa, yi the gas phase mole fraction, ϕ i ¯ the fugacity coefficient of species i, λk the Lagrange multiplier, aik the number of atoms of the kth element present in each molecule of species i, and Ak the total mass of kth element in the feed. With the constraining of element balance equation: (23) ∑ i = 1 N n i a ik = 0 . The simulations were performed in stationary conditions: the Soave–Redlich–Kwong equation of state was used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of each flow [41]. Because many fuel cell systems operate at 4.5atm, this pressure value was used for the three reforming reactors [26]. The inlet temperature of the feed streams has a strong influence on the overall reformer system efficiency: the higher the inlet temperature, the lower the energy that is required to reach an appropriate temperature level for the reforming reaction [26]. This influence was previously described by Perna [34]. However, to avoid thermal cracking, the ethanol feed must not be preheated above 683–693K. Moreover, for safety reasons, the water–ethanol–air feed temperature should be limited to 623–663K [33]. Consequently, for the three systems, the inlet temperature of 640K was used."
4,The ESR reactor,"4.1 The ESR reactor For the ethanol steam reformer, the reactor temperature and the steam/carbon ratio must be defined. The influence of the reformer temperature on the synthesis gas composition in the ESR is shown in Fig. 1 . At low temperatures, methane and carbon dioxide are the main products even if a small amount of hydrogen is also produced. When the steam-reforming temperature increases, the methane content decreases, but the hydrogen content increases. The highest hydrogen concentration is obtained at a steam-reforming temperature of 1073K. Increasing the reformer temperature beyond 1073K will increase the heat required for the reforming reaction, which can reduce the process efficiency. Moreover, higher temperatures can affect the stability of the catalytic reforming system. For these reasons, an ESR reactor temperature of 1073K was selected. The influence of the S/C ratio on the synthesis gas composition is given by Fig. 2 . Increasing the S/C improves the hydrogen yield, which can reach the thermodynamic limit (6molH2/molC2H5OH), and decreases the methane content in the synthesis gas. However, increasing the S/C ratio also increases the heat required for vaporization and the energy required for the pump used to feed the reformer. For S/C>4, the increase in the hydrogen productivity is not very significant. Consequently the S/C=4 value was selected for the ESR process."
5,The ATR reactor,"4.2 The ATR reactor For the ATR process, the reactor temperature, oxygen/carbon ratio, and steam/carbon ratio are the three parameters to be defined. The influence of the O/C ratio on the synthesis gas composition and temperature in the ATR is shown in Fig. 3 . The hydrogen production reaches a maximum for O/C values close to 0.8. Beyond this value, the additional oxygen will oxidize the synthesis gas, decreasing the hydrogen production. It is obvious that higher O/C ratios result in higher equilibrium temperatures in the reformer. At an O/C below 0.8, significant amounts of methane are produced. As soon as the optimal value of 0.8 for the O/C is reached, the increase in the reactor temperature plays a more significant role, and methane formation is avoided. Thus, at high temperatures, the methane reforming reaction (an endothermic reaction) is favored to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The increase of the O/C also increases the carbon monoxide concentration in the synthesis gas because the reactor temperature is higher and shifts the WGS reaction (an exothermic reaction) to favor the formation of carbon monoxide. The increase in the carbon monoxide concentration requires a larger size of the gas-cleaning unit. For these reasons, an ATR reactor temperature of 1073K, corresponding to an O/C value of 0.84, was used. Fig. 4 shows the synthesis gas composition and temperature of the ATR as a function of the S/C for a fixed value of the O/C equal to 0.84. The increase of the S/C slightly improves the hydrogen production and the carbon dioxide production and also reduces the carbon monoxide concentration. Indeed, hydrogen is primarily produced in the WGS reaction (Eq. (4)). Furthermore, the increase in the S/C decreases the temperature of the synthesis gas and increases the total gas flow rate due to the presence of steam not consumed by the reactions. Beyond S/C=4, the increase in hydrogen production is not significant compared to the increase of the mechanical energy required to pump the feed. For these reasons and to avoid water injection in the water gas shift reactor, an S/C ratio of 4 was selected."
6,The POX reactor,"4.3 The POX reactor Fig. 5 illustrates the synthesis gas composition and temperature as a function of the O/C ratio in the POX process. The equilibrium temperature in the reformer increases with the O/C ratio. The increase of the temperature (i.e., increase of the O/C) decreases the amount of methane in the synthesis gas. For temperatures greater than 1120K, methane formation is avoided. The hydrogen production is maximized for an O/C value close to 0.8, corresponding to a temperature near 1100K. Therefore, a POX reactor temperature of 1120K, corresponding to an O/C of 0.84, was selected to avoid methane production and to maximize H2 production."
7,Aspen plus™ model libraries and simulation assumptions,"The three processes to produce hydrogen via ethanol reforming are depicted in Figs. 6–8 . The ESR process is adapted from Giunta et al. [26] whereas those of POX and ATR were designed based on the three typical steps presented below. The simulations of these processes were performed under stationary conditions using a flowsheet simulator (Aspen Plus™ licensed by Aspen Technology, Inc.). The thermodynamic data and phase behavior predictions were calculated using the Soave–Redlich–Kwong equation of state [38,42], and the component list was the same as that used for the reactor simulations. The reforming section (ESR, POX, ATR) was modeled using the model library RGibbs as described above by minimizing the Gibbs free energy of all the species. The CO clean-up section consists of high (HTS) and low (LTS) temperature water gas shift reactors followed by a COPROX reactor. These reactors were modeled to be adiabatic using the model library RGIBBS. In the WGS reactors, methane was considered to be inert to avoid the undesired methanation reaction, which is kinetically suppressed in a real catalytic system. The endothermic nature of the ESR reaction requires a combustion furnace, which is fed by a fraction of the synthesis gas (stream 10 in Fig. 6) and air [26]. This furnace operates at atmospheric pressure, was modeled using the RStoic model library. RStoic is used when the reaction stoichiometry and degree of conversion are known and the reaction kinetics are either unknown or irrelevant [25,42,43]. For all of the heat exchangers with two input and output streams, the Aspen Plus™ model HEATX was employed. HEATX can be used for the simulation of shell and tube heat exchangers of given geometries in co- and counter-current configurations [42]. In the present work, however, the shortcut mode was used. The flow configuration was counter-current by default. The simulations were performed under the following assumptions: No pressure drop is considered throughout the system. ▪ Air, water and ethanol are entering the process at temperature T=298K and pressure P=1atm. ▪ The composition of atmospheric air is 21% O2 and 79% N2. ▪ The compressor and pump adiabatic efficiencies are 80%. ▪ The excess of combustion air is 10%. ▪ Inlet flow temperatures to the first stage of the WGS reactors (HTS) are 673K. ▪ Inlet flow temperatures to the second stage of the WGS reactors (LTS) are 523K. ▪ Inlet flow temperatures to the purification stage are 423K."
8,Results and discussion,"Table 1 illustrates the material and energy balances for each process. The results of the mass balances are expressed per mole of hydrogen produced. It can be observed that 1mol of ethanol in the ATR process is the most productive. The ATR process requires less ethanol to produce 1mol of hydrogen, i.e., 0.23mol versus 0.24mol for the POX and 0.25mol for the ESR process. The ATR process also has the lowest air consumption; consequently, it also generates the least amount of flue gas. The energy performance of these processes is expressed by their thermal efficiency. Table 1 shows that the ATR process has the best energetic performance, as 82.5% of the energy entering the ATR is recovered in the useful product, hydrogen. For the POX and the ESR, the process efficiencies are only 80.4% and 79.4%, respectively. This difference can be explained because the ATR process produces more hydrogen and also produces less flue gas (exhaust gases) that contributes to waste energy. Table 2 reports the global exergy flows of the hydrogen production processes. The ATR process also has the best exergetic performance, as it presents the highest ratio of exergy recovered in the hydrogen stream (ExH2 =Exout −Exexhaust) with respect to the total exergy supplied to the system. The destroyed exergy measures the lost energy that is unrecoverable. The ATR process has the lowest destroyed exergy and therefore has the least thermodynamic imperfection. The unused exergy of a system is defined as the sum of the exergy destroyed within the system and the exergy wasted in the exhaust stream. The contribution of these two forms of exergy in the unused exergy is reported in Table 3 . For all three systems, the unused exergy is mostly destroyed exergy, due to irreversibilities within the systems. The exhaust exergy is separated into three forms: physical or thermo-mechanical (T–M), chemical and mixing. The T–M exergy associated with the exhaust stream is due to the flue gas temperature being higher than the environmental temperature. A portion of the T–M exergy could be transformed into work by adding a bottoming cycle to the system and could contribute to an increase in the exergetic efficiency of the system (Table 4 ) while increasing the investment cost of the system. The chemical exergy of the exhaust stream is the amount of work that could be extracted from the stream if it is brought into chemical equilibrium with the environment. Because the exhaust stream is in equilibrium with itself and is composed of stable species, the extraction of its chemical exergy is difficult if not impossible [36]. The total exergy destroyed within the system is calculated by either Eq. (8) or by summing all the individual component irreversibilities. The first method is simple and fast but does not give any information about the distribution of the destroyed exergy between the process components, whereas the second method provides the destroyed exergy contribution of each component, as shown by Tables 5–7 . Fig. 9 shows that the main exergy destruction occurs in the reformer for all three processes; this is mostly imputed to the high irreversibility of the occurring chemical reactions. Furthermore, the chemical reactors (reformer, water gas shift and COPROX) contribute to approximately 70% of the destroyed exergy of each system. Many previous exergy analyses of chemical plants demonstrate that 65–90% of the destroyed exergy is attributed to the thermodynamic irreversibility of the chemical reactions [44]. To reduce the exergy destruction, it is thus generally more important to reduce the thermodynamic irreversibility of the chemical reactions through optimal designs. Such designs require an expenditure of exergy to separate and recycle the reagents but would allow the reaction to reach an optimal conversion that corresponds to the minimal exergetic losses per unit of useful reaction products [45]. Tables 5–7 also show that the exergy destroyed within the heat exchangers is approximately 20% of the exergy destroyed in the whole process. This destroyed exergy is due to the high temperature difference between the fluids in the exchangers. To minimize the exergy destruction, the temperature differences between the two streams should be as small as possible, but this will require very large heat transfer surfaces and high investment costs for the exchangers. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the system size (or investment cost) and exergetic efficiency (or operating cost). The majority of the heat exchanger exergy destruction occurs in the synthesis gas cooler “Cool-Syng”. This result is attributed to the large differences between the temperatures at either end of these heat exchangers."
9,Conclusion,"A thermodynamic analysis was conducted to investigate the characteristics of three ethanol-reforming reactors, namely the ESR, POX and ATR. Optimal operating conditions were identified for each system. Exergy–energy–mass analyses were performed to evaluate and to compare the performances of the three hydrogen processes via ethanol reforming. The energetic and exergetic performances of the processes were calculated, the locations and magnitudes of the destroyed exergy were determined and possible improvements were discussed. The mass balances show that the total required ethanol to generate 1mol of hydrogen is 0.23mol for the ATR, 0.24mol for the POX and 0.25mol for the ESR. The energetic evaluation reveals that the ATR reforming process is superior to the other systems in terms of the energy consumption required to produce the same amount of hydrogen from ethanol. For the ATR incoming energy, 82.5% is recovered in the useful product, hydrogen, whereas efficiencies are only 80.4% and 79.4% for the POX and ESR processes, respectively. Moreover, the ATR process also has the best exergetic performance. The exergetic performance represents the ratio of the main exergy recovered in the hydrogen stream to the total exergy delivered to the system. The ATR process has the lowest exergy destroyed and the least thermodynamic imperfection. The detailed exergetic analysis shows for all three of the processes that the largest exergy destruction occurs in the reformer primarily due to the high irreversibility of the occurring chemical reactions. Furthermore, the chemical reactors (reformer, water gas shift and COPROX) contribute to approximately 70% of the destroyed exergy of each system, whereas the heat exchangers contribute to approximately 20%. Consequently, research and development efforts should be focused on reducing the exergy destruction within the reformers and heat exchangers as well as recovering part of the exhaust stream exergy. Finally, exergy and energy analyses are used to evaluate bioethanol-to-hydrogen production systems and to guide efficiency improvement efforts. The results can precisely inform us about the optimum means for hydrogen production via bioethanol reforming and thus in future research and development efforts."
