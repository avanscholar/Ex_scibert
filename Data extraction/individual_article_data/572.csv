0,Introduction,"Energy supply and environment pollution are two of the main pressing concerns facing the world today [1]. Many predict that the current sources of energy that are collected from non-renewable resources will provide for not more than the few next decades [2]. To overcome these challenges, the development of alternative environmental friendly fuels such as hydrogen, ethanol and butanol has attracted wide interest all around the world [3,4]. In contrast to fossil fuels, hydrogen (H2) is a highly promising option in the succession of fuel evolution, since it is CO2-neutral emitting only water vapor as a by-product during combustion or electrochemically in a fuel cell [5]. It can be considered as a key alternative energy carrier among the gaseous fuels because of its high net calorific value (142 KJg−1) and lack of pollutant emission from combustion [5,6]. Among the various emerging techniques for production of renewable hydrogen, dark fermentation of lignocellulosic wastes using strict or facultative anaerobic bacteria is one of the most promising ways due to the high production rate and potential utilization of a vast range of wastes as feedstock [4,6,7]. The anaerobic acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation process performed using some solventogenic Clostridium strains, such as Clostridium acetobutylicum was once one of the most important biotechnological industries in the world, initially for production of synthetic rubber precursors but later on for production of solvents in the lacquer industry, and is an appropriate fuel for replacing gasoline [8]. Compared with the traditional biofuels, butanol regarded as an ideal alternative liquid fuel has very distinct characteristics including high energy content (29 MJ L−1), low vapor pressure (0.53 kPa), non-hygroscopicity and less corrosive [9,10] make it unique amongst other alcohols and solvents which has a high potential for replacing petrochemical derived energy [8]. Thus increasing attention has been recently paid to ABE fermentation. Despite to the clear advantages of biofuels production, there are several concerns associated with the economic feasibility production of alternative fuels by fermentation including costs of raw materials, low productivity and long fermentation times (>3 d) which could substantially increase the equipment and operating costs [11,12]. The major constraint in cellulosic biofuels production is availability and price of feedstocks. Hence, the availability of cheap biomass resources enhances the overall economy and competitiveness of biofuels production [12]. Considering the rich content of sugar and a tremendous waste of lignocellulosic biomass resources in Asia, lignocellulosic fibrous residues such as sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and rice straw (RS) are receiving great attention for their potential applications for second-generation biofuels production (such as H2 and butanol) [3–5,7,13]. Asian countries have enormous capacity for energy generation from crop residues. About 90.6% of the world's RS (667.6 million tons of 731 million tons per year) is produced in Asia and approximately 540 million tons SCB as a major by-product of sugarcane plants evaluated to be produced globally every year [1,3,5,14]. Bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels is basically a three-step process including pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation [4,7]. The most critical step in this process is the hydrolysis and saccharification of cellulosic biomass. Utilization of enzyme to hydrolyze agricultural residues has several potential benefits provided a higher yield, lower energy consumption, minimal inhibitors formation, milder operating conditions with a low environmental footprint than chemical hydrolysis routes [15]. However, strong crystalline structure of cellulose in SCB and RS and complicated lignin-carbohydrate complexes, restricts the effective use of hydrolytic enzymes lead to inefficient hydrolysis [16]. Among all the pretreatment methods have been used to improve the fermentative hydrogen yields, alkaline pretreatment is one of the most efficient technologies for enhancing the enzymatic digestibility of agricultural crop residues [1,17,18]. Alkaline pretreatment with sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) is a highly effective process for increasing the digestibility of hardwood and agricultural residues with low lignin content (10–18%) [19]. Pretreatment with sodium hydroxide resulted in solubilizing the lignin by cleavage of hydrolysable lignin linkages and the glycosidic bonds of the polysaccharides [15]. As such, it was found to be more effective to reduce the cellulose crystallinity and polymerization degree indicating enhanced cellulose accessibility in enzymatic hydrolysis [15,20]. According to some recent studies, microbial hydrogen fermentation using co-culture provides great benefits of higher yield in lesser time, improved performance and sufficient stability compared to the pure culture systems [6,11,12,21]. Co-cultivation of anaerobic Clostridium sp. with facultative anaerobic bacteria likewise co-culture of Clostridium butyricum with Escherichia coli and Clostridium with aerobic Bacillus have been shown great potential to improve microbial biodegradation leading to enhance the hydrogen production compare to pure culture systems [22]. C. acetobutylicum as a Gram-positive strict anaerobe is capable of simultaneously producing hydrogen, butanol, acetone and ethanol as end-product under anaerobic conditions using various types of organic matter [8,11]. E. aerogenes, an outstanding hydrogen producer is gram-negative bacteria classified as mesophilic facultative anaerobe has the ability to consume different sugars to produce hydrogen at a higher hydrogen productivity and evolution rate than strict anaerobes like Clostridia [23]. Furthermore, the theoretical maximum hydrogen yield from glucose by strict anaerobes (4 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) is higher than that from facultative anaerobes (2 mol H2 mol−1 glucose). Although the observed inhibition effect of quite a small amount of oxygen in the medium indicating the necessity of using reducing agents such as l-cysteine for steady hydrogen production, addition of the reducing agent is expensive. Therefore, hydrogen production by co-culture of strict Clostridia and facultative anaerobic bacteria like E. aerogenes can be applied to avoid the addition of the reducing agents [21]. As aforementioned, due to the capacity of both hexose and pentose sugars metabolism and biofuels production, C. acetobutylicum has been used for in situ hydrogen and ABE production along with E. aerogenes which is very attractive from a hydrogen production standpoint and as a reducing agent performs an essential role in preparation of a completely oxygen-free environment to support growth and metabolism of C. acetobutylicum. The aim of this study was to recover high amounts of energy in the form of hydrogen, acetone, butanol and ethanol from two different types of lignocellulosic biomasses including SCB and RC using alkaline pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and dark fermentation with co-culture of the C. acetobutylicum and E. aerogenes. In this way, Sodium hydroxides in different pretreatment temperatures were used to improve the biofuel production. The impact of alkaline pretreatment temperature on chemical composition and morphological structure of SCB and RS were also examined through different analyses. For the first time, co-culture of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum was used for dark fermentation of SCB and RS. Furthermore, the trends of total reducing sugars utilization, pH-time profiles of fermentation broth, end-product formation during the complete dark fermentation cycle and mass balance have also been investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Raw materials,"2.1 Raw materials Sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was supplied by Dezful Agricultural Research Institute, Khuzestan Province and rice straw (RS) was provided from a nearby agricultural field located in Lenjan, Isfahan Province. They were air dried for 5 days at ambient temperature, hammer milled and then screened by 0.841 mm (20 mesh) and 0.177 mm (80 mesh) sieves to achieve a desirable particle size. Then, they were preserved in air tight plastic bags at room temperature for further usage."
3,Pretreatment,"2.2 Pretreatment Alkaline pretreatment was applied for SCB and RS using 8% (w v−1) NaOH solution under 5% (w w−1) solids loading (based on dry weight) for an hour [19,24,25]. The pretreatments were conducted at four different temperatures: 0, 45, 75 and 100 °C in the presence and absence of 8% (w v−1) sodium hydroxide in deionized water with periodic mixing every 15 min during incubation. At the end of pretreatment, following filtration, the pretreated solids were washed with tap water until a neutral pH was obtained. Treated solids were air-dried for 48 h and weighed then stored at 5 °C for the later enzymatic hydrolysis."
4,Enzymatic hydrolysis,"2.3 Enzymatic hydrolysis Enzymatic hydrolysis was carried out using cellulase enzyme blend (Cellic CTec2; Sigma product SAE0020) with the activity of 95 FPU ml−1 measured by the standard method presented by Adney and Baker [26]. For this, 1.5 g of solids was suspended in 30 mL of 0.05 M citrate buffer (pH 4.8). The suspensions were autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. Hydrolysis was conducted by addition of the enzyme (20 FPU per g dry weight) into 118 mL sealable serum bottles (5% w v−1 solid loading) and incubation for 72 h at 50 ± 2 °C and 120 rpm shaker. The enzymes and solid loading was selected based on prior reports performed on lignocellulosic hydrogen production [27,28]. Subsequently, the solid fragments were isolated from the hydrolysates by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min (Werk NT. Baujhar 160 Ekin, Universal 320 R, Hettich, Germany). The percentage saccharification was calculated according to the equation of Mandels and Sternberg [29] as follows: (1) Saccharification ( % ) = Total Reducing sugars ( mg mL − 1 ) × 0.9 × 100 initial substrate concentration ( mg mL − 1 ) where 0.9 was the conversion factor of polysaccharide to monosaccharide accounting for water uptake during hydrolysis."
5,Microorganisms and inoculum preparation,"2.4 Microorganisms and inoculum preparation Two bacterial strains E. aerogenes PTCC 1221 and C. acetobutylicum NRRL B-591 were procured from Persian Type Culture Collection (PTTC), Iran. E. aerogenes was prepared by a loop of colony transferred from agar slant into 60 mL of nutrient broth medium (Merck) autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. On the one hand, in order to obtain a preculture of C. acetobutylicum strain, 25 mL medium containing 60 g L−1 cooked meat medium (Sigma–Aldrich) was prepared and autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. After cooling to 75 °C, 0.5 mL cell suspension was injected into the medium and heat shocked at 75 °C for 2 min and then cultured at 37 °C for 16–18 h [29]. Five milliliters of the preculture was added to a 50 mL of sterilized PGY medium containing 20 g L−1 glucose, 3 g L−1 peptone, and 1 g L−1 yeast extract. The medium was also supplemented with filter-sterilized 0.15 g L−1 cysteine and 1% (v v−1) P2 stock solution. The P2 stock solution, containing buffer (50 g L−1 KH2PO4, 50 g L−1 K2HPO4, 220 g L−1 C2H3O2NH4), minerals (20 g L−1 MgSO4·7H2O,1 g L−1 MnSO4·H2O, 1 g L−1 FeSO4·7H2O, 1 g L−1 NaCl), and vitamins (0.1 g L−1 thiamin, 0.001 g L−1 biotin), was sterilized by passing through 0.22 μm filter. After tightening the caps of bottle with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum crimp, the bottle was sparged with pure nitrogen for 5 min to create anaerobic conditions. The serum bottles were then incubated at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions for 18 h."
6,Fermentation,"2.5 Fermentation Fermentation was performed in 118 mL dark serum bottles with a working volume of 20 mL. Each bottle was loaded with 17.4 mL hydrolysate and 1% (v v−1) of each buffer and minerals solution with an adjusted initial pH of 6.8. The bottles were capped with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum crimp. Then they were sterilized in an autoclave at 121 °C for 15 min. The sterilized medium was supplemented with 1% (v v−1) filter-sterilized vitamins solution. Before inoculation, and during the fermentation, anaerobic conditions were generated by purging the bottles with pure nitrogen gas. Then each bottle was inoculated by 5% (v v−1) of pre-culture of each bacterial culture. Fermentation was conducted on 120 rpm shaker at 37 °C. This experiment lasted for 120 h. Gas and liquid samples were collected periodically during the fermentation to analyze the products’ concentration. All the experiments were conducted in duplicate and the results are expressed as average ± standard deviation."
7,Analytical procedures,"2.6 Analytical procedures 2.6.1 Determination of total reducing sugars concentration by dinitrosalicylic acid assay Formation of total reducing sugars in treated and untreated SCB and RS hydrolysates was measured by dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method [30]. An aliquot of the hydrolysate sample (0.2 mL) was mixed with 2 mL of the DNS reagent in each tube. They were incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Then immediately, the tubes were cooled on ice bath thoroughly for 5 min. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 540 nm (Rayleigh - UV1601 UV/VIS, China) after diluting 0.1 mL of the treated solution with 2 mL of distilled water. Then total reducing sugars formed was analyzed with the reported DNS method [30]. 2.6.2 Hydrogen and by-products analysis Hydrogen and carbon dioxide were measured using a gas chromatograph (Sp-3420A, TCD detector, Beijing Beifen Ruili Analytical Instrument CO) equipped with a packed column (Porapack Q, Chrompack, 3 m length, 3 mm ID, stainless steel, Germany) and a thermal conductivity detector. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The temperatures of injection port, detector and column oven were 100, 100 and 40 °C, respectively. A 250 μL pressure lock gas syringe (SGE, Australia) was applied for the gas sampling. Pure hydrogen and carbon dioxide were used as standard gases and all the results of gas volumes are based on standard references conditions. Solvents production, i.e., acetone, butanol, and ethanol, as well as VFAs (acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid) were measured using a gas chromatography (Sp-3420A, Beijing Beifen Ruili Analytical Instrument CO) equipped with a flame ionization detector and PB-21 capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm ID, polar), with nitrogen as the carrier gas. The column temperature was adjusted between 45 °C and 125 °C (4 min at 45 °C and then 25 °C min−1 to 125 °C) and the temperatures of injector and detector were adjusted to 115 °C and 200 °C, respectively. 2.6.3 Feedstock analysis The total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) content of the treated and untreated SCB and RS were measured using oven at 105 °C overnight until constant weight followed by combustion in the muffle furnace at 575 °C for 24 h [31,32]. Structural Carbohydrates and lignin contents of each sample were analyzed according to the methods of Sluiter et al. [31]. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify released sugars. It was equipped with a UV/vis and RI detectors (Jasco International Co., Tokyo, Japan) and an ion-exchange column (Aminex HPX-87P, Bio-Rad), using deionized water as eluent with a flow rate of 0.6 mL min−1 at 85 °C. Morphological and structural changes in treated versus raw SCB and RS were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The dried samples were coated with gold (Emitech SC7640 sputter coater, UK) and microscopic images were taken by SEM (Zeiss, EVO® LS, Jena, Germany) at a voltage of 15 kV. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer was used to study the crystallinity and structural features of the samples before and after pretreatments (TENSOR 27 FT-IR, Bruker, Leipzig, Germany). The spectra were recorded with an average of 60 scans with 2 cm−1 resolution in the region of 600–4000 cm−1. 2.6.4 Kinetic parameters The total amount of cumulative hydrogen volume production curves over time was fitted using modified Gompertz [33]: (2) H = H m a x × exp { − exp ( R m × e H m a x ( λ − t ) + 1 ) } Where, H is the cumulative H2 production (mL H2), Hmax is the maximum H2 production potential (mL H2), λ is the lag-phase time (h), Rm is the maximum H2 production rate (mL h−1), t is the incubation time (h), and e is the Euler's number (e = 2.71828)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,The effects of NaOH-pretreatment on chemical composition of sugarcane bagasse and rice straw,"3.1 The effects of NaOH-pretreatment on chemical composition of sugarcane bagasse and rice straw Total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) contents of the untreated and treated SCB and RS are presented in Table 1 . The initial VS contents of untreated SCB and RS were 0.93 and 0.89 of their TS contents, respectively, while the VS TS−1 ratio was increased in all treated samples compared to the untreated ones. The maximum value of VS TS−1 ratio was observed for NaOH-pretreated samples at 100 °C that corresponded to the most fractions of organic biodegradable materials as VS in TS. The carbohydrates and lignin contents of the untreated and pretreated samples are summarized in Table 2 . Results show that lignin and hemicellulose were removed more than cellulose, causing higher glucan concentration in the pretreated samples. The glucan content of both SCB and RS was increased nearly 4.9–25.4% and 8.5–35.7% as a result of the alkali pretreatment, respectively. Similar results were reported by Cui and Shen [34] who investigated the effects of alkaline (NaOH) pretreatments at different concentrations (0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4% and 8% (w/v) on saccharification of grass. In their study, the TRS yield from pretreated grass was higher than that from raw grass and the amounts of TRS after 8% NaOH pretreatment were approximately 5.84-fold greater than that in the raw substrate. The results suggest that temperature had a significant impact on the lignin and hemicelluloses contents. Higher pretreatment temperatures enhanced xylan and lignin removal. Nosratpour et al. [1] observed that increasing the temperature in alkaline pretreatments resulted in higher glucan and lower xylan content of the pretreated samples. In both feedstock cases, the highest contents of glucose were obtained after pretreatment at 100 °C. Pretreatment of RS was more successful than SCB in lignin removal resulted in higher proportion of the glucan content such a way that the lignin content in RS was reduced to less than 5%, while under the best conditions, the lignin content in SCB was decreased from 19.2% to 10.1% consistent with the results reported by Cheng et al. [35]. Moreover, these observations agreed well with works of de Carvalho et al. [36] which compared the impact of alkaline pretreatment at different alkaline charges (5%, 10% and 15% NaOH w/w) on the chemical composition of eucalyptus, sugarcane bagasse and straw. In their study, the glucose content was higher for straw with less residual lignin content, when compared to the pretreated bagasse. They showed that lignin structures vary corresponding to different sources of lignocellulose, indicating that NaOH pretreatment had significant effect on some sources of biomass than others. According to Adler [37], rice straw and sugarcane bagasse contain p-hydroxyphenyl–guaiacyl–syringyl (H–G–S) lignin which present substantial amount of free phenolic hydroxyl groups and a cross-link via ester bond between lignin and hemicelluloses have reacted more effective than woody biomass in the alkaline solution at short reaction times and moderate temperatures and readily delignified. Contrary to alkaline pretreatment, water treatment without NaOH did not have considerable effect on lignin content and increasing in temperature of water was not effective enough for removing more lignin. Moreover, according to the obtained values of solid recoveries (Table 2), SCB and RS were clearly more susceptible to the alkaline conditions; high severity pretreatment conditions led to higher reduction of non-glycosidic sugars and lignin content in solids. The lowest solids recovery of both SCB and RS were observed at 100 °C which was 57.4% and 42.7%, respectively. It seems that at pretreatment temperature of 100 °C, the major part of lignocellulosic constituents was released to the liquid phase. A similar solid recovery was reported by Nosratpour et al. [1] from sugarcane bagasse and Dong et al. [5] from rice straw that was subjected to similar alkaline conditions."
10,The effects of NaOH-pretreatment on structure of sugarcane bagasse and rice straw,"3.2 The effects of NaOH-pretreatment on structure of sugarcane bagasse and rice straw 3.2.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Alterations of morphology by pretreatment of the lignocellulosic feedstocks were followed by SEM images (Fig. 1 ). Although there is a little difference in the composition of pretreated SCB and RS, their structural characteristics were completely different. The length and width of RS are generally lower than those of SCB which is clearly visible in the SEM images of pretreated samples. Such characteristics are in agreement with those showed by Rials and Wolcott [38]. As it can be seen, the untreated SCB and RS have a flat and rigid surface which represented lignin coverage on the fiber, while SCB became loose with some missing parts on the surface. This means that lignin and part of hemicelluloses were removed through the alkaline treatment, while little change was occurred after water pretreatment. On the other hand, sodium hydroxide treated RS seemed to be thoroughly destructed leading to disintegration of joined fibrous matrix and thus more fibers fragments appeared separated on the surface as a result of lignin removal. Thin fiber bundles remain free and are better seen in the RS samples. Similar structural changes have been observed in sugarcane bagasse after NaOH pretreatment and in rice straw after sodium carbonate pretreatment [4,39]. This modified structure with higher surface area could be easily accessible for the enzymatic hydrolysis. 3.2.2 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) The structural changes in SCB and RS by pretreatment were investigated using FTIR spectroscopy. FTIR spectra of the untreated and pretreated samples associated with the most biogas production are presented in Fig. 2 . It is obvious that, the water pretreatment had almost no change in the characteristic peaks of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose. In other word, water pretreatment has only a weak effect on the destruction of samples. The measurement of the transmittance infrared spectrum is classified into two sub-regions: the high wavenumber range from the broadband at 3400–3200 cm−1 and 2900 cm−1 referring to O–H and C–H stretching vibration, respectively, indicated the presence of cellulose molecule, and the lower wavelengths region from 1800 to 700 cm−1. The prominent peak around 3400 cm−1 and 1070 was seen in all spectra, which is representative of the presence of cellulose. Broadening and the decrease of the corresponding peaks of these bands are referred to the O–H stretching vibration due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding and some rupture of the hydrogen bonds of cellulose structure [18]. The signal peak around 1730 cm−1 was owing to the ester functional group (CO) between hemicelluloses and lignin. The disappearance of this peak after pretreatment indicates the lignin removal due to the ester bond cleavage. Weakening and loss of intensity peak at ~1260, 1520, and 1644 cm−1 corresponding to the aromatic skeleton vibrations and carbonyl group confirmed lignin was removed from the SCB and RS to a great extent during the alkalization [4,40]. Furthermore, the signal at 896 cm−1 was related to the β-1,4-glycosidic linkages between the sugar units in hemicellulose and cellulose and it was increased after pretreatment due the removal of lignin and hemicelluloses [41]. The bonds at 1430 cm−1 and 898 cm−1 are referred to crystalline structure of cellulose I and anti-parallel cellulose II during regeneration; thus, the absorbance ratio of these peaks was defined for comparisons of the cellulose crystallinity. In strong alkali solution (8% (w v−1)), partial or total transformation of cellulose I to cellulose II begin to occur and leads to swollen cellulose lattice resulting from the intermolecular hydrogen bond degradation [17]. Crystallinity index (CI) is determined as ratio A1430/A869 [42]. Table 3 shows the CI values of both SCB and RS corresponding to the sodium hydroxide and water pretreatment at 45 °C and 100 °C, as compared to untreated samples. The CI of untreated fresh samples of SCB (1.55) and RS (1.37) are almost comparable. It was dropped for both the samples as a result of alkaline sodium hydroxide pretreatment, however, with relatively more drop in RS than SCB. Total crystallinity index regarded as (A1375/A2900) for the untreated and pretreated SCB and RS are presented in Table 3. The treatment at 45 °C generated the lowest crystallinity. The increase in crystallinity index after the pretreatment at 100 °C could be the result of removal of amorphous parts (xylan and lignin) of the substrate. The effect of pretreatment temperature can be observed in water treated samples. Similar structural changes could be observed for sugarcane bagasse pretreated with sodium alkaline pretreatments [1] and rice straw pretreated with banana peel ash and calcium hydroxide [43]. Overall, based on the results presented, it can be perceived that lignin degradation clearly occurs after alkaline sodium hydroxide pretreatment and also the chemically delignified biomass swelling was confirmed by broadened region of hydroxyl (OH) groups bound which increases the accessibility of cellulose to enzymes. This result was according to the biochemical composition of lignocellulosic biomass from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) analysis shown in Table 2."
11,Enzymatic hydrolysis,"3.3 Enzymatic hydrolysis The untreated and pretreated sugarcane bagasse and rice straw were subsequently subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis for 72 h using cellulase enzyme blend (Cellic® CTec2). The hydrolysis results are summarized in Fig. 3 . The results present poor performance of the cellulase digestions on untreated samples as compared to the pretreated ones. As shown in Fig. 3, the pretreatments of both SCB and RS displayed high impact on the enhancement of enzymatic saccharification. The highest reducing sugars concentration of 36.9 ± 0.6 g L−1 and 40.7 ± 0.2 g L−1 was observed for the sodium hydroxide-treated SCB and RS at 100 °C, respectively. These indicate yields of 66.4 ± 1.0 and 73.3 ± 0.4 g reducing sugars per 100 g of alkali pretreated SCB and RS, respectively, while the yields of water-treated SCB and RS at corresponding temperature were only 32.4 ± 0.4 and 30.3 ± 1.0 g reducing sugars per 100 g of water-treated samples. One possible explanation for this phenomenon could be attributed to the most hemicellulose and lignin removal which reached 49.3% of xylan and 69.7% of acid insoluble lignin (AIL) for SCB and 73.2% of xylan and 91.2% of AIL for RS as shown in Table 2. According to the values for hydrolysis yield presented in Fig. 3, higher quantities of lignin and hemicellulose removal mainly xylan in RS can further improve the yield of enzymatic hydrolysis compared to SCB. This elimination caused structural destruction and improving the cellulose accessibility of enzymes is consistent with previous studies [44–46]. Furthermore, hydrolysis yield for alkali-treated SCB and RS at 0 °C was higher than that of the pretreated sample at 45 °C. Despite to 16% higher lignin content (Table 2), the RS pretreated samples at 0 °C was converted to 20% higher sugars yield. This observation is in line with the previous studies and was related to dissolution behavior of non-degraded polysaccharides and lignin during NaOH pretreatment at low temperature (0 °C) [47,48]. There are several reasons explaining this finding. Alkaline solution (Na+ cations) penetrates through the porous cellulose matrix, then solvate the cellulose and regenerate neighboring crystalline areas [50]. These ions remain in the structure and act as a countercharge to carboxylate ions and an alkali complex formation occurred. Moreover, hydroxyl ions lead to the hydrolysis of hemicellulose to fermentable sugars and efficient lignin removal [50,51]. On the other hand, dissolution of cellulose in cold alkali solutions occurred at high concentrations of NaOH (at least 6–8% (w v−1)) and low temperatures (e.g., at 0 °C), in a sense, can also result in a change in the cellulose crystal structure from cellulose I (parallel configuration) to cellulose II (an antiparallel configuration) [50,52]. These in turn resulted in higher accessible surface area and increase the swelling capacity of lignocelluloses. However, the pretreatment is not very effective on delignification at lower temperatures (e.g. 0 °C). Water treatment in absence of sodium hydroxide was not severe enough to modify the recalcitrant structure of SCB and RS, resulting in a low yield of hydrolysis [50]. Therefore, the alkaline pretreatment compared to pure water treatment is more effective within the temperature range tested in this work, and is thus a vital step in the overall cellulosic biofuel production process."
12,Fermentative hydrogen production from sugarcane bagasse and rice straw hydrolysate,"3.4 Fermentative hydrogen production from sugarcane bagasse and rice straw hydrolysate The sugarcane bagasse and rice straw were pretreated with 8% (w v−1) sodium hydroxide solution and then hydrolyzed. The resulting hydrolysates originating from 50 g L−1 of pretreated feedstocks were used for fermentation using co-culture and pure cultures of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum. The solid loading was chosen based on initial experiments and previous studies [27,51]. The effect of different pretreatment conditions on the cumulative hydrogen production of SCB and RS are displayed in Fig. 4 and Table 4 . As can be seen, higher amount of hydrogen was produced from sodium hydroxide pretreated samples compared to the water treated ones without any chemical agents. The H2 content in the biogas ranged from 35 to 57% (Table 4). After 120 h of anaerobic dark fermentation, maximum cumulative H2 production of 136.3 mL g−1 VS was obtained with the maximum production rate of 195.4 ± 4.9 mL L−1 h−1 and yield of 1.6 ± 0.0 mol H2 mol−1 total reducing sugars from SCB hydrolysate pretreated by 8% (w v−1) sodium hydroxide at 100 °C, while the maximum cumulative H2 production, production rate and yield from water pretreated SCB hydrolysates were 46.2 ± 1.0 mL g−1 VS, 85.3 ± 0.4 mL L−1 h−1 and 1.2 ± 0.1 mol H2 mol−1 total reducing sugars. Regarding the RS hydrolysates, maximum cumulative H2 production of 149.9 ± 4.9 mL g−1 VS, maximum productivity 159.5 ± 14.3 mL L−1 h−1 and yield of 1.7 ± 0.1 mol H2 mol−1 total reducing sugars were obtained from the RS hydrolysate pretreated at 100 °C by 8% (w v−1) sodium hydroxide solution (Fig. 4). Cheng et al. [35] utilized similar alkali pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse and rice straw containing about 20 g L−1 pretreated feedstock for biohydrogen fermentation by Clostridium spp resulted in hydrogen production yield of 0.79 (mol H2 mol−1 reducing sugar) and 0.57 (mol H2 mol−1 reducing sugar) for pretreated sugarcane bagasse and rice straw, respectively. Moreover, the hydrogen production yield of 134.64 mLg−1 raw rice straw has been reported from 30 g L−1 solid loading rice straw by Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum M18 [5]. The effect of pretreatment with 8% (w v−1) sodium hydroxide on hydrogen production of SCB is less than those with RS samples. For the pretreated feedstocks with sodium hydroxide solution at the best condition, the H2 production yield was enhanced by 25–40% compare to water treated samples. These results demonstrate that enhanced hydrogen yield correlates well with increase in the soluble sugars content and lignin removal [20]. In other words, the pretreatment of the SCB and RS exerts a substantial impact on all following processes leading to dark fermentative hydrogen production. Fermentative hydrogen production from hydrolysates of alkali pretreated SCB and RS at 100 °C by pure cultures of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum was compared to their co-culture (Figs. 5 and 6 ). The highest cumulative volume of hydrogen (117.1 ± 8.9 mL and 138.5 ± 4.5 mL from SCB and RS, respectively) was obtained with co-culture of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum, giving a greater H2 production than obtained with the pure cultures (Fig. 5). Fig. 6 shows the co-culture of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum which improves the H2 production yield compared to the pure cultures. Furthermore, C. acetobutylicum present higher H2 production values than E. aerogenes. It was hypothesized that these differences might be linked to the different ability of individual pure microbial strains to degrade substrate. In fact, the versatility and efficacy of clostridia in consuming various sources of carbohydrates containing complex polysaccharides as cellulose and hemicelluloses may have beneficial effects on hydrogen production from widespread natural resources [6]. The average hydrogen production rates from SCB and RS by the E. aerogenes (3.2 mL h−1) were more than those in the cases of using pure C. acetobutylicum (1.8 and 1.6 mL h−1, respectively). Despite a longer period of fermentation (~120 h) and slower average hydrogen production rate of C. acetobutylicum strain, the anaerobes had higher hydrogen content which strongly affects the gas product quality and substrate conversion efficiency to hydrogen (Fig. 5). In contrast, E. aerogenes strain, a facultative anaerobe, stimulated the growth of obligate anaerobes and enhanced the consumption rate of substrate to achieve higher hydrogen productivity and evolution rate [52,53]. Besides, E. aerogenes effectively consumes the present traces of oxygen and supports the creation of restrict anaerobic condition which is favorable to C. acetobutyricum growth [21]. Therefore, after the combination of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum with the same proportion, a well-characterized syntrophic interaction occurs among the bacteria [53], increasing the average production rate of hydrogen and shortened the H2 fermentation period, as can be observed in Fig. 5. It could be concluded the facultative anaerobic bacteria was good for increasing the hydrogen production rate and adjusted the hydrogen production lag phase while obligate anaerobic bacteria played a determinant role in improving the hydrogen production capacity. 3.4.1 Kinetic analysis of cumulative hydrogen production The time courses of cumulative hydrogen production of the SCB and RS hydrolysates pretreated by 8% (w v−1) sodium hydroxide solution at 100 °C were used to be kinetically modeled by the modified Gompertz equation to provide a better understanding of the hydrogen production pattern obtained from co-culture of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum and their pure cultures (Fig. 6). The specific hydrogen production rate was initially increased, and then decreased in all the cases. According to Table 5 , the kinetic constants of the Gompertz model were dependent on the bacterial species. The maximum hydrogen production was obtained at 120 h of fermentation and the corresponding H2 production rates from co-culture fermentation of the SCB and RS hydrolysates were obtained 3.9 and 3.6 mL H2 h−1, respectively. The duration of lag phase was 1.9 and 2.1 h upon treating SCB and RS, respectively, by co-culture of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum which reduced by 50% and 80%, respectively, compared to C. acetobutylicum, further exemplifying the role of E. aerogenes. All regressions with a coefficient of determination (R2) and the adjusted-R2 (Adj-R2) exceeding 0.99 and also, the root mean square error (RMSE) between the modified Gompertz model predictions and experimental data in the range of 1.18 and 5.54 ensuring that hydrogen production by each pure cultures and co-culture was well applied to the modified Gompertz model."
13,"Acetone, butanol and ethanol production using co-culture of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum","3.5 Acetone, butanol and ethanol production using co-culture of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum Anaerobic hydrogen production of pretreated SCB and RS was accompanied with formation of a variety of end liquid product as shown in Table 6 . The overall production yield of acetone, butanol, and ethanol as well as acetic acid and butyric acid based on the initial SCB and RS utilized by co-culture or each of pure cultures were evaluated. Results suggest that the sodium hydroxide pretreatment of SCB and RS had significant effects to enhance the concentration of butanol and acetone. Furthermore, butanol was the fermentation product which has the most affected by the pretreatment conditions [15]. The hydrolysate obtained from water and alkaline pretreatment of SCB and RS resulted in production of 15–20 g L−1 and 26–42 g L−1 sugar content, respectively. In the case of water pretreatment at 100 °C, the hydrolysate of pretreated SCB were fermented to produce 1.97 ± 0.3 g L−1 butanol, 1.1 ± 0.2 g L−1 acetone, 0.2 ± 0.1 g L−1 ethanol and 3.3 ± 0.0 g L−1 ABE and the corresponding values were obtained 1.8 ± 0.1 g L−1 butanol, 0.7 ± 0.0 g L−1 acetone, 0.1 ± 0.02 g L−1 ethanol, 2.6 ± 0.4 g L−1 ABE for pretreated RS hydrolysate. While, fermentation of SCB hydrolysates originated from sodium hydroxide pretreatment containing 36.9 g L−1 total reducing sugars was accompanied by 4.6 ± 0.3 g L−1 butanol, 3.4 ± 0.1 g L−1 acetone, 1.1 ± 0.0 g L−1 ethanol and 9.1 ± 0.2 g L−1 ABE and for RS hydrolysate with 40.7 g L−1 sugar content, 6.2 ± 0.5 g L−1 butanol, 2.1 ± 0.3 g L−1 acetone, 1.3 ± 0.1 g L−1 ethanol and 9.5 ± 0.7 g L−1 ABE were produced. Therefore, alkali pretreatment resulted in 2.7-fold enhancement in ABE production due to higher saccharification approximately 45–70% compared to water pretreatment (25–35%) in the enzymatic hydrolysis stage. In addition, as shown in Table 6, the dominant VFA by C. acetobutylicum and co-cultures of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum using SCB and RS hydrolysates with a sugar content of 36.9 g L−1 and 40.1 g L−1, respectively, were different from those with pure culture of E. aerogenes. The co-culture and C. acetobutylicum produced butyric and acetic acids as dominant VFAs, while the pure cultures of E. aerogenes also produced propionic acid in addition to butyric and acetic acids. This indicates that the dominant pathway in biohydrogen fermentation by the co-culture and C. acetobutylicum alone was butyric type of fermentation, while fermentation by E. aerogenes containing the same concentrations of total reducing sugars were likely to follow the propionic pathway due to glucose overloading in which pyruvate was directly decomposed to propionic acid without hydrogen production [54]. Higher concentration of feedstocks result in higher acidogenesis rate, which is linked to a higher ratio of reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to its oxidized form (NAD+). To keep the balance ratio of NADH/NAD+, propionate pathway proceeds spontaneously leading to increased production of NAD+ [55]. This behavior is consistent with the findings of Asadi et al. [27], who investigated the impact of various concentrations of glucose and rice straw hydrolysate on hydrogen production and yield by E. aerogenes and found that the greater glucose concentration changes the pathway to produce other products and metabolites besides hydrogen, including carbon dioxide, butanediol, ethanol, acetate, lactate, succinate, formate, and biomass. Concentration profiles during fermentation of SCB and RS hydrolysates (pretreated using 8% (w v−1) sodium hydroxide at 100 °C) by co-culture and each of pure cultures of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum are depicted in Fig. 7 . In the first step of fermentation, rapid growth of C. acetobutylicum and E. aerogenes strain was occurred with a short lag phase. As shown in Fig. 7 for both case of SCB and RS, no significant amounts of ABE accumulation was seen in the first 12 h, while acetic acid and butyric acid grew rapidly which shown acidogenesis happened in this period. The accumulation of acetate and butyrate led to a drastic decline in medium pH which strongly inhibited consumption of sugars and the growth of bacteria [56]. In this way, ABE production through volatile fatty acids (VFA) reduction occurred rapidly from 12 h to 72 h, while acetate and butyrate started to decrease slightly. Butanol was enhanced from 0.4 to 4 g L−1 for SCB and from 0.3 to 4.4 g L−1 for RS, which suggested that the solventogenic stage of co-culture system started in exponential growth phase. Moreover, it is noteworthy to mention that hydrogen evolution of SCB and RS was also increased from 2.0 to 4.0 L L−1 and 1.9–6.0 L L−1 during exponential growth phase indicating the occurrence of simultaneous solventogenic phase with hydrogen production (Fig. 8 ). This behavior was also observed by Wu et al. [10] for coproduction of butanol and hydrogen gas by Clostridium beijerinckii IB4, where 62% butanol and 55% hydrogen production occurred simultaneously in the exponential growth phase. They reported that butanol and hydrogen productivities were both affected by cell growth which is obviously pH dependent. As shown in Fig. 8, the initial pH drop was observed from 6.8 to nearly 4.8, because of VFAs accumulation within 12 h, while hydrogen was produced at a rate of 3.4 and 3.2 L h−1 from pretreated SCB and RS hydrolysates, respectively. Then, followed by VFAs reduction, pH was increased to approximately 5.2 after 48 h. Therefore a phase transition from acidogenesis to solventogenesis was occurred. Ultimately, production of hydrogen continued with lower production rates and the pH value of medium gradually decreased to 4.9. Acetone, butanol and ethanol are obtained during ABE fermentation process whereas ethanol only accounts for approximately 10% of total ABE [57]. Here, the mass ratios of ethanol/ABE were achieved in a range of 6.3%–25.6%. The performance of different microbial strains as pure and co-culture is compared with that of relevant studies in Table 7 . Despite butanol and hydrogen can be produced simultaneously in ABE fermentation, due to different optimal fermentation conditions for maximum production of each fuel, most of the previous studies had been carried out by different pure clostridia for either ABE or hydrogen fermentation [15,16,58–61], whereas little effort was made on coproduction of hydrogen and butanol fermentation using simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SHF–SSF) processes [3,35]. The present study investigated the effective hydrogen and ABE production simultaneously from alkaline pretreated SCB and RS using a co-culture of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum in dark fermentation process. The syntrophic co-culture interaction between E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum could be the reason to obtain relatively high hydrogen yields which notably more than the other studies in batch fermentation mode, while the butanol concentration was lower than the reported results (Table 7). These results showed butanol production competed with hydrogen evolution in ABE fermentation [10]. In order to analyses the superiority of co-culture and each of pure cultures of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum in fermentation process, the energy content of lignocellulosic biofuels (acetone, butanol and ethanol) from alkaline pretreated material were determined according to their combustion heat values, with a total specific energy yield of 5.5 and 6.6 kJ kg−1 pretreated SCB and RS, respectively. The results mentioned above indicate that the energy production efficiency is greatly dependent on the composition of feedstock and operation mode. As indicated in Table 7, the SHF–SSF operation could give the highest total energy generation performance with an energy generation yield of 9.6 kJ kg−1 sugar [3]. In contrast, among the batch fermentation processes of SCB and RS, batch dark fermentation using co-culture resulted the highest total energy generation."
14,Mass balance,"3.6 Mass balance The results obtained from alkaline pretreatment (using 8% (w v−1) sodium hydroxide at 100 °C), enzymatic hydrolysis and batch fermentation of SCB and RS were used to make an overall mass balance and a comparative analysis of fermentation product for co-culture and pure cultures of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum in dark fermentation process (Fig. 9 ). 100 g of SCB contained 43.1 g glucose and 20.4 g xylose which 57.4 g solid (dry weight) recovered after the alkaline pretreatment and despite the substrate loss, due to the lignin removal of 70%, the glucan content was enriched to 68.5% (39.3g glucan). Therefore, a higher cellulose enzymatic saccharification (66.4%) of pretreated sugarcane bagasse was able to achieve owing to greater accessibility of cellulase to the substrate from sodium hydroxide pretreatment. The enzymatic hydrolysis released 42.4 g (dry weight) total reducing sugars from 57.4 g pretreated feedstock. Batch fermentation of pretreated SCB hydrolysate using a co-culture of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum led to yield 13.6 L hydrogen per 100 g SCB along with ABE fermentation of 5.8 g butanol, 4.3 g acetone and 1.4 g ethanol while 15.0 L hydrogen per 100 g RS was produced with co-production of 5.5 g butanol, 1.9 g acetone and 1.2 g ethanol. The total fermentative acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) generated from pretreated SCB were 2.2 and 10.6 g including acetone (0.0 and 3.3 g), butanol (0.0 and 6.5 g), and ethanol (2.2 and 0.8 g) by pure culture of E aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum, respectively, which the corresponding attribute values for pretreated RS were 2.5 and 8.4 g including acetone (0.0 and 2.3 g), butanol (0.0 and 5.6 g), and ethanol (2.5 and 0.5 g). Fig. 9 shows an increase of hydrogen yield to about 3.4-fold and 1.5-fold on both substrates in a co-cultured state versus pure cultures of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum, respectively, while butanol was approximately produced the same as those experiments carried out with pure cultures of C. acetobutylicum. Overall, this work provides useful information for future development of both hydrogen and butanol production via dark fermentation of lignocellulosic feedstock by using co-culture of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum."
