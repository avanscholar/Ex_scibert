0,Introduction,"The second generation antiepileptic drug, lamotrigine (LTG) was approved for treatment of epilepsy as neuroprotective drug which is used as mono or adjunctive therapy [1]. Although it is rapidly absorbed, with maximum plasma concentrations attained at 1.4–4.8 h, and plasma protein binding reaching 60%; it undergoes extensive metabolism and is mainly renally eliminated, with elimination half-life of 32.8 h. An alternative route of administration was suggested to avoid excess drug intake by patients. Transvascular administration would be efficient for LTG brain delivery; as it can access brain vascular barrier, reducing side effects of the administered dose [2]. Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles are particulate carriers known for their sustained drug release properties, subcellular size, and biocompatibility with tissue and cells. This facilitates capillary penetration for cell uptake; increasing drug accumulation at target sites. Biodegradation of such polymers includes cleavage of sensitive bonds resulting in polymer erosion. Depending on their degradation mode; polymers are classified into hydrolytically degradable and enzymatically degradable polymers [3]. Poly (D, l-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLCL) is a biodegradable copolymer of polylactide (PLA) and poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL), combining mechanical properties of both homopolymers, allowing adjustable degradation rate by varying its constituent polymers ratio. PLCL can, thus, be tailored to possess different mechanical properties [4]. Thus; PLCL presents unique physicochemical properties substantiating polymer versatility in nanoparticles design and development. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is one of the most frequently used stabilizers, enhancing production of stable small sized particles with narrow size distribution. In addition; it has been reported that a portion of PVA remains linked with polymeric nanoparticles surface even with repeated washing, forming a stabilizing layer that improves their freezing resistance without addition of cryoprotectant [5]. Drug delivery to brain has been challenging to formulators, due to physiological barriers. For brain delivery of particles, they should possess particle size (PS)-values less than 200 nm and polydispersity index (PDI)-values less than 0.2 in order to be considered transportable, i.e; any increase in PS would be associated with decrease in its cellular uptake, potentially affecting drug bioavailability. Thus; optimization of emulsifier characteristics is considered crucial; as it decreases interfacial tension between aqueous and organic phases leading to decrease in solvent droplets size, causing subsequent decrease in PS of the finally obtained formulation, while stabilizing the system by preventing particles aggregation [6]. Polyvinyl alcohol is a hydrophilic thermoplastic biologically decomposable polymer, widely used for its exceptionally versatile chemical and physical properties, biocompatibility, stability to temperature variation, and non-toxicity to living tissues and cells [7]. Its degradability is enhanced through hydrolysis owing to its hydroxyl groups [8]; with hydrolysis levels varying along a typical value of 80% to more than 99%, depending on the medium acidity. Its fully hydrolyzed forms result in the cross linking of its linear polymeric structures giving them tuneable stabilizing properties [9]; since chemical and physical properties of PVA are a function of the percentage of its hydrolysis. Thus; we can find that the biocompatible grade of PVA; employed in the present study, has a unique structure that can chemically bind to or physically entangle with a nanoparticle surface and stabilize it, mainly through electrostatic repulsion; rather than steric hindrance, while engaging with minimal cell adhesion [10]. Pluronic®127 is a self-assembly amphiphilic tri-block copolymer surfactant; effective as solubilizing and stabilizing agent for poorly water soluble drugs. Depending on their stereo-structure and hindrance, the polymer self-assemble in micelles in aqueous solution, with a hydrophobic core; that is segregated from the aqueous exterior by a hydrophilic corona. Thus; preventing aggregation, protein adsorption and particle recognition by the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Consequently; increasing drug blood circulation time [11]. Although; such properties are considered advantageous for the nano carrier system, however; efficiency of Pluronics as stabilizers is a factor of the concentration and system temperature employed during preparation and along administration. This can be challenging, since their optimal critical micelle concentration (CMC) and temperature (CMT), cannot necessarily provide the optimal expected advantages of the nano carrier employed; as optimal targeting ability, circulation time and ease of production. Moreover; their synthetic nature still represents a drawback for their elimination technique from human body, although; their use tends to improve low molecular mass drugs, as LTG, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution [12]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), of various molecular weights, as well as different grades of Pluronic are widely used as stabilizing agents for various nano carrier systems. Each has its advantages and disadvantages that would allow a wide array of interchangeable characteristics of the finally formulated nanoparticles. Based on their chemical structure, processing and hydrolysis, their stabilizing mechanism differs, thus; their physicochemical properties can be tailored till optimization is achieved. This has been practically proven through our present and previous study [13]. In the latter; Pluronic®127 was the stabilizer employed. This resulted in a highly sustained release kinetics of LTG from the polymeric nanoparticles formed, extending along two weeks. This would enhance patient compliance, since the dose would be administered every fortnight rather than daily basis. In addition; the side effect profile of LTG would be deminuated, as the GIT would be totally avoided and no drug would be lost by any means. Moreover; Pluronic®127 has a reported advantage of facilitating the blood brain barrier targeting and cell penetration, as it interacts immediately with the cell membrane. Thus; dose efficiency would be even higher [14]. However; in this study; different molecular weights of PVA are used instead. Their effect on the LTG release kinetic profile and other physicochemical properties of the final formulations were investigated both in-vitro and in-vivo. In our previous study LTG was loaded in PLCL-based nanoparticles stabilized by Pluronic®F127 [15]. The amount of Pluronic®F127 and PLCL type and concentration affected the nanoparticles properties. Furthermore, preparing the nanoparticles by emulsification solvent evaporation technique using binary-solvent system as the internal phase (ethanol/acetone) gave higher values for entrapment efficiency (EE), drug loading capacity (DLC), yield percentage (YP) and zeta potential (ZP), than those obtained using mono-system (acetone) or tertiary-system (DCM/ethanol/acetone) as internal phases, as reported in our previous studies [13] and literature [16]. In this study; PLCL nanoparticles were formulated for brain delivery of lamotrigine using different molecular weights of PVA as stabilizer. Effect of varying polymer type (PLCL), surfactant molecular weight (PVA) and concentrations on formulation physicochemical properties was studied. The pharmacokinetics of the selected formulation was tested in Albino rats."

2,Methods,
3,Preparation of PLCL nanoparticles stabilized by PVA,"3.1 Preparation of PLCL nanoparticles stabilized by PVA The spontaneous emulsification solvent diffusion method was used to prepare PLCL/PVA nanoparticle. In this study 125 mg of PLCL and 25 mg LTG were dissolved in 25 mL binary solvent mixture (acetone:ethanol with 3:2 vol ratio). LTG/PVA solution obtained was then gradually poured into 50 mL emulsifier-containing aqueous phase of concentrations (0.5–4%w/v PVA), while agitating on magnetic stirrer (Wisestir® digital hotplate magnetic stirrer MSH-30D, PMI- Labortechnik Gmbh, Germany), at 15,000 rpm [17]. Dispersion formed was transferred into 500 mL rotating evaporating flask, to be condensed to 25 mL under vacuum at 60 °C for 30 min using Rotavapor, Heidolph VV 2000, Germany. Dispersion formed was centrifuged for 30 min at 24,000 rpm and −4 °C using Tabletop cooling high speed centrifuge, Sigma 3-30 KS, Sigma Laborzentrifugen GmbH, Germany. The precipitate was then washed with 25 mL ethanol. Centrifugation followed by washing were repeated triplicates to remove un-entrapped drug, surfactant and residual organic solvents [18]. Table 1 shows nanoparticles composition."
4,Freeze drying process,"3.2 Freeze drying process Prepared nanoparticles were freeze-dried, using suitable cryoprotectant in a non-aseptic area using Lyophilizer, FD-81, Eyela, Japan. Freeze-dried samples were then stored at 8 °C before analysis [19]."
5,Characterization of nanoparticles,"3.3 Characterization of nanoparticles 3.3.1 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) PLCL nanoparticles were placed on TEM copper grids and stained with 2 %w/v phosphotungstic acid for viewing by JEOL, JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope, Japan, operated at 120 kV. 3.3.2 Particle size (PS) and zeta potential (ZP) Samples, in triplicates, were diluted with double-distilled deionized water to measure the particle size and zeta potential-values using ZetaSizer Nano ZS analyzer (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK). Polydispersity index (PDI) is also determined on measuring particle size. Its value indicates the distribution of size along the sample, reflecting sample homogeneity from size perspective. As for zeta potential measurements, charge distribution margin (ZPD) and conductivity (CD) are two values that are also measured parallel to surface charge. The former reflects homogeneity of charge distribution on particle surface, while the latter reflects the ability of particles to conduct electricity, and should be less than unity for stability of particles within human body [20]. 3.3.3 Entrapment efficiency (EE) and drug loading capacity (DLC) Freeze dried samples; in triplicates, were dissolved in ethanol, then filtered with 0.45 μm membrane filter. Then aliquots were withdrawn for scanning for drug concentration spectrophotometrically at λ max of 306.5 nm, while DLC was determined according to the following equation: DLC = (Total amount of drug - Amount of unbounded drug)/(Nanoparticles weight) × 100 3.3.4 Yield percentage The dried weight for specific amount of the formulation was referred to the initial weight of the raw components to calculate the yield according to the following equation [21]: Yield Percentage (YP) = Nanoparticles weight / Total initial solids weight × 100"
6,In-vitro drug release studies,"3.4 In-vitro drug release studies Dialysis method was used to test drug release from the formulated nanoparticles under sink condition. A sample (3 mL) in secured dialysis membrane was immersed in 150 mL glass bottle (n = 3) containing 100 mL phosphate buffer solution with pH-value of 7.4. A preservative was added to the release media in order to inhibit fungal and bacterial growth (0.01% w/v sodium azide). The glass bottles were shaken at 150 struck per minute and kept at 37 ± 0.5 °C [22] (Shaking Incubator, GFL 3032, Germany). Aliquots from the release media (2 mL) were collected at different time intervals over a week and they were replaced with equal volume of fresh media. Amounts of drug in the collected samples were quantified spectrophotometrically at 306.5 nm. Mean cumulative drug percentage released was plotted as function of time, and drug release data was kinetically analyzed using KineDS3 software and data was processed for linear-regression analysis using Excel statistical procedures (Office 365, 2013, USA). Release efficiency (RE), defined as percentage of the area of the rectangle corresponding to 100% release for the same total time was calculated [23]. In-vitro release profile of LTG from the prepared polymeric nanoparticles was calculated using a modified form of the Noyes-Whitney equation [24] to fit the nano carrier prepared [25], as follows: % Drug released = [(Abs. of LTG/slope) * (Wt. of preparation/50) * 1/10 * (Volume of Dissolution Medium/initial dose)] * 100"
7,Stability studies,"3.5 Stability studies Stability was conducted in triplicates at two different storage conditions, viz., at accelerated conditions (40 °C and 70% relative humidity) and at refrigerator condition (2–8 °C) for 3 and 6 months. At specific time intervals, PS, ZP and EE-values for the samples were analyzed [26]."
8,Sterilization and sterility testing,"3.6 Sterilization and sterility testing Based on European Pharmacopoeia recommendations, gamma irradiation was carried out for nanoparticles sterilization at the Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority (EAEA), Egypt. Samples were γ-irradiated at room temperature using Cobalt-60 Gamma Chamber 4000-A (BHABHA, India), receiving dose of 25.3 kGy for 179 min [27]. Sterility testing and validation were performed after sterilization, with sterile Brewer's thioglycollate resazurine broth (BioMérieuxw, Marcy, France) as aerobic or anaerobic medium for bacteria detection, and Tripcase soy broth (BioMérieuxw, Marcy, France) as medium for yeasts and fungi detection. Biological indicators used were Clostridia spieces as anaerobic bacteria and E-coli spieces as aerobic bacteria. These medias were incubated at 32οC for 14-days and examined regularly to monitor any growth."
9,In-vivo pharmacokinetic studies,"3.7 In-vivo pharmacokinetic studies Protocol of these studies was approved by institutional review board of National Research Center, Egypt. About 200–250 g Wister male Albino rats were randomized into 3 groups, each comprising 6 rats, at each time interval: “Test” group taking selected polymeric IV formulation, “Standard” group receiving Lamictal® oral tablets and “Control” group receiving IV placebo “Drug-free polymeric nanoparticles”. The freeze-dried sterilized powder for the medicated nanoparticles were reconstituted in 25 mL saline solution (1 mg LTG/mL); from which 1 mL was injected intravenous (tail vein) in each rat (2.5 mg/250 gm rat), while crushed diluted (2–3 mL saline solution) Lamictal® tablet solution was administered orally to rats using intragastric tube (2.5 mg/250 mg rat) [13]. 3.7.1 Brain uptake studies After drug administration, rats were anesthetized with chloroform at different time intervals, then rats were decapitated and their skulls were cut, opened and brains were removed. The weight for the brain tissue samples were recorded and then physiological phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) was added to each brain tissue as 5 mL/g. Brain tissue was subjected to homogenization in an ice-cold bath using glass homogenizer. The homogenized brain tissue was then transferred into clean containers. Blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes from the trunk directly after rats were decapitated, then blood samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 min. Supernatant (plasma) was transferred to new sterile tubes. Collected homogenized brain tissue and plasma samples at different time intervals were stored at −80 °C [28]. 3.7.2 HPLC-UV assay 3.7.2.1 Chromatographic conditions HPLC method of analysis was used for quantitative detection of the drug in the collected samples. PerkinElmer series 200 liquid chromatography system (HPLC) with Perkin Series 200 UV/Vis Detector set at 306 nm, connected to PM-80 pump, Rheodyne manual injector with 50 μL loop and TotalChrom Chromatography Workstation systems (model 600 LINK Interface) were used in this analysis (PerkinElmer, Norwalk, CA, USA). The analysis was performed with Inertsil® ODS-3 of 5 μm Hydro-RP column (250 mm × 4.6 mm I.D.; GL Sciences Inc., Japan). A mixture from equal volumes of potassium monobasic phosphate buffer (25 mM, pH 3.5) and methanol was used as the mobile phase in this study with flow rate of 1 mL/min. This HPLC method for detection of lamotrigine in brain tissue homogenate and in plasma is specific, linear, sensitive, accurate and precise method [29]. 3.7.2.2 Analysis process calibration Diaverdine HCl (Pioneer Pharma, Egypt) was used as an internal standard (IS) in our study. It was prepared as 100 mg/L stock solution in methanol. The internal standard was diluted with methanol and added to brain tissue homogenate and plasma in concentrations of 20 mg/L and 40 mg/L, respectively. Lamotrigine concentration was calculated form the calibration curves constructed by plotting mean internal standard peak area ratio against corresponding lamotrigine concentration. 3.7.2.3 Processing blood and brain tissue for HPLC analysis Aliquot of 1 mL 2 N NaOH solution (basification) was mixed with 1 mL plasma. After that, 5 mL ethylacetate was added to the mixture and vortexed for 1 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The organic layer (upper part) was then separated and dried at 45ᵒC using nitrogen evaporator. Aliquot of 1 mL internal standard solution was added to the residues and then they were mixed with 100 μL mobile phase by vortexed, to be finally injected into HPLC system. For brain tissue preparation; 1 mL brain homogenate was deproteinized by adding 100 μL of 20% trichloroacetic acid solution. Then the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm and 15 °C for 15 min. The upper layer was submitted to liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate after basification, as described for plasma. Standard and control samples were similarly prepared. 3.7.3 Pharmacokinetic studies Pharmacokinetic data were calculated using WinNonlin® software (Pharsight Co., Mountain View, CA, USA). Drug-brain targeting was calculated according to two main indices; modified to fit the actual study. (1) Drug targeting efficiency (DTE) [30]: D T E = [ ( A U C b r a i n 0 − 360 min A U C b l o o d 0 − 360 min ) I V ( A U C b r a i n 0 − 360 min A U C b l o o d 0 − 360 min ) O r a l ] × 100 (2) Direct transport percentage (DTP): D T P = [ B I V − B X B I V ] × 100 where; BIV is AUC0–360min (brain) following IV administration, and BX is brain AUC fraction contributed by systemic circulation through BBB following oral administration, and equals: B x = ( B I V P I V ) × P o r a l where; BIV is AUC0–360min(brain) following IV administration, while PIV is AUC0–360min (blood) following IV administration and Poral is AUC0–360min (blood) following oral administration."
10,Statistical analysis,"3.8 Statistical analysis Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis were carried out using SPSS software (ver. 14.0, SPSS Inc., USA). Least Significant Difference (LSD) with 5% confidence level was used for significant detection for changes in the collected data."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Preparation of PLCL nanoparticles stabilized by PVA,"4.1 Preparation of PLCL nanoparticles stabilized by PVA Generally; binary organic solvent diffusion method, is developed to produce nanoparticles with high yield as reflected through our previous study [7]. At cloud point, once PLCL is dispersed into PVA solution, large interfacial area is produced due to interface perturbation, resulting in nano-sized particles. Attraction between acetone and PLCL is higher than that with ethanol, thus; ethanol preferentially diffuses out of the internal phase to the aqueous phase, increasing PLCL concentration in the internal phase, inducing its instantaneous and spontaneous solidification into uniform nanoparticles dispersion [31]."
13,Characterization of nanoparticles,"4.2 Characterization of nanoparticles 4.2.1 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Micrographs shown in Fig. 1 present nanoparticles with sizes lying below 200 nm; as required for optimal penetration of BBB without being up taken by reticuloendothelial system. All nanoparticles have dense polymeric shells and less dense drug core. 4.2.2 Particle size (PS) and zeta potential (ZP) On preparing nanoparticles using PVA as stabilizer, fraction of it; hydrophobic segments, remains associated with the interface, penetrating the organic phase, forming interconnected network within polymeric matrix, influencing PS, ZP, and PDI values for the obtained nanoparticles (Table 2 ). It was found from Table 2 that PS of the prepared nanoparticles generally decreased with increasing PVA concentration from 0.5 to 4 %w/v (p < 0.05), while PLCL polymer concentration was kept constant. This can be explained on the bases that the hydrophobic vinyl acetate part in the PVA at its critical micelle concentration acts as anchor polymer at oil interface binding to polymer surface. Thus, as PVA concentration increases, its molecular density at o/w interface increases, leading to increase in residual PVA on surface [32], and further decrease in PS and PDI values of the obtained particles. Nanoparticles with lower PS ranges were observed for those prepared using LPVA compared to those prepared using HPVA. This comes in accordance with previous studies reporting same comparative results; where molecular weight effect of HPVA, on the contrary to LPVA, was reflected through higher preparation viscosity, resulting in less efficient homogenization process and thus; particles with larger sizes and high PDI values [33]. Although, nanoparticles prepared using PLCL with 25: 75 monomers' ratio were expected to show lower PS ranges, compared to their homologues prepared using PLCL with 80: 20 monomers' ratio due to the effect of increasing PCL vs PLA monomer content within polymer structure; this effect proved to be statistically insignificant in our study (p > 0.05). This could be attributed as technical advantage of using binary organic solvent diffusion method, that provides maximum solubility to all components, leading to production of stable and efficient emulsion system with small PS regardless to its composition, as supported by previous studies [34]. Table 2 also presents ZP values of the prepared formulations; all nanoparticles possessed negative charge; that could be attributed to polymer negatively ionized ester termination of carboxyl group in the PLCL polymeric structure. Zeta potential is a crucial factor regulating biodistribution and pharmacokinetic properties of drug particles within human body, providing insights about product stability as function of electric repulsion; hindering aggregation prominently at values above 30 mV (positive or negative) [35]. Results in Table 2 reveals that nanoparticles prepared using PLCL with 25: 75 monomers' ratio showed significantly higher ZP values (p < 0.05) compared to their homologues prepared using PLCL with 80: 20 monomers' ratio reflecting effect of altering PLA: PCL ratio on surface charge, and consequent stability. Surface charges of nanoparticles prepared using PLCL with 80: 20 monomers' ratio ranged between −22.80 ± 3.49 mV for BP1H4 and -38.72 ± 5.76 mV for BP1L0.5, and ranged between −26.70 ± 2.59 mV for BP2H4, and -48.40 ± 4.28 mV for BP2L0.5, for nanoparticles prepared using PLCL with 25: 75 monomers' ratio. Zeta potential-values for the formulated nanoparticles generally decreased as PVA concentration increased (p < 0.05), indicating higher stability, agreeing with what was reported by previous studies; attributed to acetate group of PVA molecule. Particles prepared with HPVA, generally, show lower ZP values compared to their LPVA homologues (p < 0.05). This might be attributed to higher HPVA viscosity, resulting from its high molecular weight, causing increase in the adsorbed surfactant layer thickness at particle interface; leading to decrease in ZP value [36]. All the prepared nanoparticles, generally, showed narrow charge distribution margin (ZPD) and conductivity (CD), reflecting higher particle stability, ranging between 0.03 ± 0.09 and 1.89 ± 0.10 mV for ZPD values and 0.03 ± 0.09 and 0.16 ± 0.03 mS/cm for CD values. Briefly; all nanoparticles had mean CD value less than unity, indicating system stability. 4.2.3 Entrapment efficiency (EE), drug loading capacity (DLC) and yield percentage (YP) Surfactant type and concentration are known to influence entrapment efficiency, drug loading capacity and yield percentage-values for the nanoparticles [37]. Table 3 shows that EE, DLC and YP values for the formulated nanoparticles decreased with increasing surfactant concentration, irrespective to PLCL type (p < 0.05). This effect is highly pronounced due to constant (polymer: drug) ratio, which makes surfactant concentration the sole factor influencing characterization parameters. Highest EE and YP values were reported for BP1H0.5 (99.78 ± 3.11, and 98.40 ± 4.42%, respectively), while highest DLC value was reported for BP2H0.5 (71.40 ± 9.02%). On the other hand; least EE, DLC and YP values were reported for BP1L4 (30.45 ± 4.45, 14.62 ± 1.02, and 59.99 ± 9.09%, respectively). In emulsion solvent evaporation method, used to formulate the PLCL nanoparticles, several forces control both emulsification and stabilization processes, affecting amount of drug entrapped [38]: (1) Drug molecules hydrophobicity, like lamotrigine, obliging it to reside in oil phase, and refuse migration to continuous phase, resulting in initially high EE. But; on increasing PVA concentration, it may diffuse out to form micelles in external aqueous phase that could solubilize the drug outside the nanoparticles (decrease EE). Furthermore, overlay more PVA molecules on droplets surface increases the protection of the internal phase against coalescence, yielding small emulsion droplets after solvent evaporation [39], and consequent also decrease in EE-values due to formation of smaller particles, from which loss of drug increases compared to larger particles. (2) Strong hydrogen bonds formed via hydroxyl group between inter- or intra- PVA molecules; leading to its gelatinization at oil/water interface during nanoparticles formation process, resulting in decrease in EE values of the obtained particles, as observed from Table 3, and as reported in previous studies, with increasing surfactant concentration [40]. (3) High continuous: oil phase ratio approaching (2: 1) or higher, as in our study, provides nearly sink condition for organic solvent, hence; extracts solvent instantly, leading to fast particle solidification, with consequent decrease in PS, DLC and EE values, as reported in previous studies [41] and verified by results. The EE, DLC and YP reported values for HPVA-based nanoparticles, were higher than their LPVA-based nanoparticles homologues. This might be attributed to higher viscosity of HPVA. In previous studies, it has been reported that higher EE is usually caused when viscosity of emulsion formed increases due to high viscous resistance against the shear force during emulsification [42]."
14,In-vitro drug release studies,"4.3 In-vitro drug release studies Preparations BP2H1, BP2H2, BP2L0.5, BP2L1 and BP2L2 were perceived as optimal as they showed PS values less than 200 nm, PDI values less than 0.2, EE values higher than 80%, DLC values higher than 50%, YP values higher than 75%, and ZP values more than −30 mV. Thus; they were selected for in-vitro drug release studies, as shown in Fig. 2 . It is noticeable that all of the selected nanoparticles were prepared from PLCL (25: 75) not PLCL (80: 20) monomers' ratio, indicating the overall role of polymer monomer ratio in determining the final characteristics of the formed nanoparticles. A significant increase (p ≤ 0.05) was noticed in mean cumulative percent of lamotrigine released by the end of the experiment, as follows: 45.36 ± 3.32 (BP2H1), 58.94 ± 4.97 (BP2H2), 75.15 ± 5.01 (BP2L0.5), 89.14 ± 4.18 (BP2L1), and 97.40 ± 3.39% (BP2L2), with the following respective release efficiency (RE) values: (37.6 ± 4.55), (51.3 ± 4.69), (58.3 ± 6.30), (71.9 ± 2.81), and (80.8 ± 5.23) %, reflecting the effect of increasing PVA concentration (1–2% w/v for HPVA) and (0.5–2% for LPVA) nanoparticles, as reported previously in literature [43]. Furthermore, nanoparticles prepared using HPVA had mean cumulative percent of lamotrigine released and RE-values lower than those for their counterpart formulations prepared using LPVA (p ≤ 0.05). This can be attributed to the more viscous layer for the HPVA on the nanoparticles which retarded LTG release from nanoparticles. The relation between PVA molecular weight and its hindrance ability to drug release, has been proven in a previous study [44], where similar results were reported. With reference to Fig. 2; it is noticeable that all formulations showed an initial rapid drug release rate up to 6hr, followed by a decrease in release rate, that is reflected through a plateau in the mean cumulative percent of LTG released. Based on R2 values, kinetic analysis of lamotrigine release revealed that none of the formulations followed zero order release kinetics, instead; best fitting model reported for all formulations was Michaelis-Menten [45]. This is characteristic for sustained drug release. This can also be attributed to unknown polymer degradation mechanism, which, in most cases, is not uniform."
15,Stability studies,"4.4 Stability studies After storage of the five nanoparticles at refrigeration temperature for six months, all formulations proved stable with non-significant, (p > 0.05), changes in their: PS, EE, DLC, ZP and YP values, as shown in Table 4 . Refrigeration, generally; helps to keep polymeric particle surface intact; thus; no drug would be allowed to escape, or leak through any surface disruption. Generally; polymeric surfaces become liable to disruption as temperature increases. In addition; their release profile and LTG release kinetics were also evaluated after 3 and 6 months of storage under the different storage conditions, previously stated. Results are shown in Figs. 3–7 . On storage at 40 °C/70%RH, BP2H1, and BP2H2 proved to be totally unstable (change in their tested properties). This can be justified through the significant changes in the size of particles after Three and six months of storage under the mentioned conditions. This was, consequently, coupled with a significant decrease in both EE and DLC. It would reflect the effect of heat on both the surfactant binding abilities and polymer degradation. However; BP2L0.5, BP2L1, and BP2L2 proved to be stable for only 3 months. Thus; this could be attributed to molecular weight differences of PVA sub-types, where higher viscosity of HPVA; results in relatively larger PS and PDI values, which increases by time due to particles liability for aggregation during storage. Leakage of the drug along the storage period was noticed through the significant decrease in EE, DLC and YP, after six months of storage for BP2L0.5, BP2L1, and BP2L2. After storage for three and six months in refrigeration and at 40 °C/70% RH. Stability of nanoparticles was evaluated in terms of LTG release kinetics profile. It is worth noting that samples were filtered before undergoing the release experiment, in order to remove any residuals that might have been produced due to nanoparticle disruption or drug release under the stated storage conditions. The in-vitro release kinetic trend of LTG after three and six months of storage under different storage conditions, came in accordance with the trend observed in the changes of particle size, zeta-potential and entrapment efficiency after the same storage period and under the same conditions. It is worth mentioning that the release kinetic model did not change and persisted as Michaelis-Menten in all the tested formulations, under different storage periods and conditions. However; instability was reflected through the significant variations in release efficiency (RE) parameter and the mean cumulative amount of LTG released along one week-experiment, while stability was evident through the insignificant RE and mean cumulative amount of LTG comparably released. In general; RE of LTG significantly decreased when instability was observed."
16,Sterilization,"4.5 Sterilization After subjecting the selected most stable formulations: BP2L0.5, BP2L1, and BP2L2 to gamma irradiation, their sterility was tested against various microbial strains, as previously explained [46]; where they proved to be sterile, with no microbial growth detected both after 7 and 14 days. In addition; on re-examining their PS, ZP and EE values, no significant changes (p > 0.05) were observed, indication total efficiency of the used method of sterilization."
17,In-vivo pharmacokinetic studies,"4.6 In-vivo pharmacokinetic studies Formulations BP2L0.5, BP2L1, and BP2L2 proved to be stable and sterile, BP2L2 was selected for the in-vivo pharmacokinetic studies, due to its highest RE-value. Fig. 8 demonstrates mean values of lamotrigine concentration over a week in rat plasma and brain tissue homogenate, after administration of oral Lamictal®, and IV nano-formulations (medicated and unmedicated), as previously explained. From Fig. 8 (a), on oral administration of Lamictal® tablets; lamotrigine concentration increased gradually in rat plasma to reach its maximum value; Cmax of 1668.06 ± 69.18 μg/mL at Tmax of 5 h. These results conform with pharmacokinetic product data provided by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The Tmax-value for orally administered formulation was significantly low, (p ≤ 0.05), compared to that of IV administered formulation BP2L2. Cmax, AUC, and t1/2-values for orally administered formulation were significantly higher, (p ≤ 0.05), compared to those for IV administered formulation BP2L2;, in rat plasma, with no lag time observed on administering both dosage forms. Following IV administration of BP2L2 formulation, lamotrigine concentration was very low in plasma; Cmax of 6.59 ± 0.22 μg/mL at Tmax of 96 h, as lamotrigine was not in its free form, and owing to release properties of PLCL (25: 75 monomers' ratio) demonstrated through in-vitro dissolution test, very limited amount of lamotrigine would be free during the formulation journey in rat plasma before it reaches the brain. On reviewing lamotrigine pharmacokinetic profiles in rat brain, as presented in Fig. 8 (b), it is clear that lamotrigine was released in a sustained manner over a week when it was IV administered; with a significantly high (p ≤ 0.05) Cmax value of 1820.67 ± 200.71 μg/mL after IV administration of the nanoparticles, compared to that after oral administration (Cmax of 1762.22 ± 180.70 μg/mL). These Cmax values were obtained at a significantly short time (p ≤ 0.05) (Tmax values after IV and oral administration of lamotrigine formulations were 6 and 24h, respectively). It was also obvious from the graphs, that AUC and MRT values for lamotrigine after IV administration of the nanoparticles were significantly higher, (p ≤ 0.05), compared to their homologues after oral administration of lamotrigine market product, which might be due to failure of orally administered lamotrigine to pass the BBB, yielding little final amount in rat brain, while; IV administered BP2L2 nano-formulation managed to passively target the brain, transporting encapsulated lamotrigine across BBB by passive diffusion199. On evaluating brain targeting ability of lamotrigine after oral and IV administration through: drug targeting efficiency, (DTE); and intravenous–to–brain direct transport percentage, (DTP), as per equations previously mentioned, results revealed that IV administered LTG-loaded BP2L2 formulation can evidently target the brain, as it shows significantly high, (p ≤ 0.05), DTE and DTP-values of 100% and 92.972%, respectively, compared to oral Lamictal® tablet DTE and DTP-values of 3.202% and 48.179%, respectively. Presented results go in accordance with the design purpose of each dosage form; as lamotrigine included within the oral tablet appeared faster in plasma, with only small amount of lamotrigine crossing BBB, while; the opposite happened with IV administered BP2L2 formulation; as almost small amount of lamotrigine appeared in blood stream, since lamotrigine was encapsulated within polymeric nanoparticles, to be released in a sustained manner in the brain, with distribution time in systemic circulation, after injection, not exceeding few minutes. It is also worth noting that no lamotrigine toxicity symptoms was practically reported along the whole experiment."
18,Conclusion,"In this study, stable poly-ε-(D, L, lactide-co-caprolactone)-polyvinyl alcohol (PLCL-PVA) based nanoparticles with adjustable properties, to passively penetrate the blood-brain barrier were prepared using lamotrigine; an anti-epileptic drug acting centrally, as model drug. The use of high concentration PVA in preparing nanoparticles decreased values of their particle size, Zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, drug loading capacity and yield percentage. On the other hand, using high concentration of PVA in preparation of the nanoparticles increased the mean cumulative drug released from nanoparticles. The use of high viscosity PVA in preparing the nanoparticles resulted in particles with higher particle size, entrapment efficiency, drug loading capacity, yield percentage-values and lower zeta potential-values and drug release pattern. Only zeta potential-values were affected with changing the PLA: PCL monomer ratio of the polymer. Tested nanoparticles were physically stable up to six months of storage under refrigeration conditions. Finally, selected intravenous formulation composed of PLCL-LPVA nanoparticles were able to penetrate blood brain barrier, providing sustained drug release along a week, with significantly higher pharmacokinetic values in the brain tissue, compared to the marketed oral conventional tablet, as per their optimized characteristics."
