0,Introduction,"Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) are the systems which involve microbiology for generation of energy from wastewater in various form such as electricity, hydrogen and other value added chemicals [1,2]. These BESs have undergone remarkable technological transformation from simpler Microbial fuel cell (MFC) to the state of art technology like bioelectrochemical power to gas in recent years [3–5]. Specifically, Microbial Electrolysis Cell are advantageous BES as they produce energy in form of hydrogen, which is a cleaner fuel gas with high-energy content. In MEC, extracellular electron transporting microorganisms easily oxidize the organic matter into protons and electrons, and then convert into hydrogen with supply of small electrical input lower than the water electrolysis (i.e. <1.23 V) [6]. Nowadays, a research shift from high performance acetate fed MECs to real wastewater fed MECs has occurred owing to focus on energy recovery simultaneous with wastewater treatment [7,8]. Using wastewater both, industrial and domestic type as various substrates in MEC systems has improved the overall energy efficiency along with hydrogen recovery. In general, the microbial interactions in the anode side is the prime factor influencing efficient hydrogen production in these systems [7,9]. However, the electron transport and combination to form hydrogen is accredited to the cathode materials. Till date, precious metal based materials especially Platinum (Pt) are used for excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with faster kinetics. Pt, being non-abundant and very costlier, has the drawback of getting easily poisoned deteriorating its catalytic activity. In order to match the performance of Pt catalysts and electrodes, various range of metals with different grades and forms are employed in the studies of development of suitable materials to meet criteria of commercial feasibility and large availability. Many researches have been carried out with stainless steel, carbon based electrodes, nickel based alloys for the low-cost cathode development. Mostly transition metals have been used for cathode materials as they exhibit better HER and electrochemical activity. In development of commercial cathode to replace expensive electrodes, Nickel Foam (NF) with 3D structure has been investigated interestingly in MEC applications. In comparison with SS, Ni and other carbon based materials, NF demonstrated better hydrogen evolution [10] in spite of its intrinsically low electrochemical activity [11,12]. Various emerging catalysts like NiP [13], CoP [14], WP, MoP [15], FeP [16], NiFe LDH [17] had demonstrated the high HER and improved performance in MEC. Phosphides, Sulfides and oxides of transition metals have been focused in hydrogen recovery improved the power density of the system on applications in microbial fuel cells [18]. Graphene based materials on cathode have significantly improved the overall performance of the systems because of their high electrochemically active property [19–21]. Generally, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are synthesized for improving the economy, as pristine form is very costlier and less abundant in nature. When rGO are bound with metal oxides, they enhance the intrinsic electrochemical properties of composites and demonstrate a better performance. In addition to the better electrocatalytic properties with high surface area and electrical conductivity, they also act as catalyst support material superior to other carbon based materials like activated carbon and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [22]. In view of economic feasibility and excellent performance, recent studies are mainly focused metal and transition metal based materials for a suitable catalyst for its purpose in MEC especially cathodes. Nickel based materials are employed extensively due to their benefit of exhibiting less over-potential especially for HER in MEC [17,23]. In addition, studies with cobalt-based materials in MEC for performance enhancement are also available signifying the metal catalytic activity similar to Nickel [18]. Biohydrogen production comes into limelight of energy-efficient process, only when it can be tapped from industrial effluents apart from synthetic simpler form substrates. Hence in this investigation, sugar industry wastewater (SWW) is used as substrate in a dual chamber MEC reactor. In our previous work, the performance of three cathodes namely Stainless Steel mesh, Nickel Plate and Nickel foam (NF) were assessed in SWW [24]. It was inferred that NF shown better results than the other two materials. Hence, in this study, a novel nanocomposite catalyst on NF has been evaluated for its performance in SWW fed MEC. As discussed earlier, the combination of metals like Ni, Co advantageous in better HER with rGO of better electrocatalytic properties was considered for the synthesis of NiCo2O4.rGO catalyst to improve the hydrogen production from an industrial effluent. The synthesized nanocomposite was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and electrochemically with Cyclic voltammetry (CV) &Electrochemical impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). In this investigation, the biohydrogen production in MEC using the synthesized catalysts on the NF facets was practically demonstrated with hydrogen production rate (HPR), coloumbic efficiency (CE), cathodic hydrogen recovery (CHR) and overall hydrogen recovery (OHR) in dual chamber MEC operated with SWW."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of NiCo2O4.rGO nanocomposites,"2.1 Synthesis of NiCo2O4.rGO nanocomposites Chemicals used were Cobalt chloride hexahydrate, Nickel chloride hexahydrate, Ammonia solution, Sodium borohydride, Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), Graphite powder, Dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K2HPO4), Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4), Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), Sodium chloride (NaCl) and Sulphuric acid (H2SO4). All the above were of analytical grade and used without any further purification. Using modified Hummer’s method, Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared from graphite powder prior to preparation of the nanocomposite catalyst [25]. For synthesis of NiCo2O4.rGO nanocomposite, 100 mg of GO was dispersed in 50 ml of deionized water to form an aqueous dispersion and then kept under sonication for 1 h for uniform mixing. CoCl2·6H2O and NiCl2·6H2O were taken in the molar ratio 2:1 and dissolved in 60 mL of distilled water forming a homogeneous solution. This solution was transferred into GO dispersion and then kept under constant stirring for the time period of 2 h. 15 mL of ammonia solution was diluted 10 times and added in dropwise to the stirring solution. And finally, 10 ml of sodium borohydride (0.5 M) was added and followed by stirring for another 30 min. The solid product was obtained after centrifuging for 20 min and subsequently washed with distilled water and ethanol several times, respectively. After all washings, the synthesized catalyst material was dried at 60 °C in vacuum oven and kept in desiccator prior to use. Same procedure was repeated for the synthesis of NiCo2O4 without the steps involving the addition of GO dispersion."
3,Fabrication of modified cathodes,"2.2 Fabrication of modified cathodes NF was cleansed with diluted acid solution in sonication bath for 30 min to remove impurities due to surface oxidation and then washed with deionized water and ethanol. NF electrodes are prepared by simple manual coating of the nanocomposites on the surface using a polymer binder. Rolling-press method was not used because it could cause damage to scaffold 3D structure of the Nickel foam. The required quantity of both catalysts were dispersed in DI water separately and then PVA was added to the composites in the ratio of 1:10 (wt/wt %). For 6 h, the solution was heated at 60 °C and kept under sonication. This uniform dispersion was coated on NF to obtain 10 mg/cm2 of nanocomposites and then kept in vacuum drier for time period of 12 h at 60 °C. Successively, cathodes were made as per the same dimensions of graphite anode and used for further studies. The cathode electrode fabricated with NiCo2O4.rGO and NiCo2O4 nanocomposites were denoted as NCG-NF and NC-NF respectively."
4,MEC construction and operation,"2.3 MEC construction and operation MEC reactors were fabricated using acrylic glass of 3 mm thickness with design as described in the previous work [24]. The anode was plain graphite plate was immersed in the 250 mL of 100% SWW in the anodic compartment. The cathodic chamber was filled with 50 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) and a proton exchange membrane -Nafion-117 (DuPont™, Nafion) was used as separator. The nanocomposite electrodes NCG-NF, NC-NF and bare NF (control) were assessed for their performance as cathodes in the individual MECs. Before every cycle, nitrogen (N2) gas was sparged and the anode compartment was completely sealed. Hydrogen gas was collected from cathode chamber with help of a fabricated glass unit with silicone stopper by the principle of volume displacement. Gas chromatography was carried out recurrently for the collected gas sample. A DC power supply (Bestmach, Chennai) (0–30V/0-5A) was used to supply the additional voltage required by the MECs. Preliminary experiments were conducted initially to find the external voltage and the time of operation of MECs for the best outcomes as described in our previous study [24]. A small external ohmic resistance of 10 Ω was connected in the closed circuit to determine the working current. All MECs were operated in a five-day fed batch mode and experiments were done in triplication under room temperature (32 °C)."
5,Measurement and analyses,"2.4 Measurement and analyses The current was logged automatically into a Data Acquisition System (LTDAQ-1052, Labtech Electronics Pvt Ltd, Chennai). Multi-parameter wastewater analysis instrument (PCD650, Eutech) was used to measure the important characteristics of SWW like pH, conductivity, resistivity, Total dissolved solids (TDS), Salinity etc. COD Analyzer (digestive spectrophotometry) was used in determining the COD of substrate. GC analysis for intense identification of hydrogen peak was performed with Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) using carrier gas N2. All calculations associated with the performance of MEC such as Hydrogen production rate (HPR), COD removal Efficiency, Coloumbic Efficiency (CE), Cathodic Hydrogen Recovery (CHR), Overall Hydrogen Recovery (OHR) and Energy recovery (ŋE) were based on the formula given in Appendix A."
6,Characterization and electrochemical analysis,"2.5 Characterization and electrochemical analysis Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images along with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) were obtained on VEGA3 TESCAN equipped with Oxford Instruments EDS system at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) images were acquired from JEOL-2100+ High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope at accelerating voltage of 200 kV and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out in PHI - VERSAPROBE III instrument. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the nanocomposite was recorded with a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu-Kα radiation source (λ = 1.54178 Å) with 2θ range from 10° to 90°.The electrochemical characterization were performed in the electrochemical station (Amteksi, USA) using classic three electrode system. The fabricated electrode, Platinum mesh and Standard Ag/AgCl were used as working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode respectively in the electrolyte of 50 mM phosphate buffer (PB) solution. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) were conducted for three cathodes (including bare NF) over a potential range between −1.0 V and 1.0 V at a scan rate of 50 mV/s and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) between 1 Hz and 100 kHz frequency range at amplitude potential of 10 mV. Amteksi supported Versa software was used to analyze both LSV data and EIS spectra."
7,Characteristics of wastewater,"2.6 Characteristics of wastewater Sugar wastewater was collected from cane processing industry nearby Erode, Tamilnadu. The collected wastewater was kept in deep freezer for further use after identification of the various characteristics of wastewater. It was less turbid in nature with foul smell and of yellowish brown in color. The important characteristics of were; Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of 4400–4700 mg/l, conductivity of 5.8–6.7 mS, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) of 2800–2900 ppm, pH- (4.5–5). SWW was not further diluted but pH was adjusted to 7 for anolyte as described previously [24]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,"XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS and EDX analyses","3.1 XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS and EDX analyses XRD pattern of NiCo2O4.rGO was shown in Fig. 1 . The main characteristic diffraction peaks were obtained at 35.6°, 43.7°, 66.4° and 76.5° were consigned to (220), (311), (400), (511) and (440) planes of NiCo2O4, respectively. Additionally, there was a mild peak at 24.9° signifying the presence of rGO in the nanocomposites. This was in good agreement of a spinel type cubic structure of Fd-3 m space group in comparison with standard XRD of NiCo2O4 [26]. Also, other peaks corresponding to rGO were not dominant in the XRD pattern and decrement in the crystallinity was found in the peak intensities [27]. This clearly depicted that exfoliation of rGO had occurred during the synthesis of the nanocomposite which made peaks weaker or even disappeared in the pattern. The lack of other diffraction peaks from impurities attributed to the purity of NiCo2O4.rGO nanocomposite. The morphology of the NCG-NF was studied under Scanning Electron Microscopy and the images obtained clearly represented the NiCo2O4.rGO nanocomposites coating on its facet as shown in Fig. 2 . The surface of the NF with nanocomposites was visually apparent of adherence of the wrinkled rGO with agglomerated nickel cobaltite crystalline structure. Due to incorporation of rGO, NiCo2O4 particles aggregation had been improved and evidently observed without the re-stacking of rGO sheets. From Fig. 2A and B, SEM images of nanocomposite illustrated the formation of nanocomposites bound to surface of the NF with help of the polymeric binder, so that appearance was in contrast to pristine nickel cobaltite. This difference was attributed to the addition of rGO similar to the images report of the metallic oxides/graphene nanocomposites [28]. Also it was essential to visualize the stability of the nanocomposites on the electrode surface. Fig. 2C represented the images of electrode construction surface as prepared and on comparison with used electrode even after 10–12 batch cycles of operation did not possess much difference or any deterioration shown in Fig. 2D. EDX analysis revealed the main elements in NCG-NF electrodes were C, Ni, Co, O content of nanocomposites. The weight percentage of C, O, Co, Ni were 30.52, 28.19, 19.34 and 21.95% respectively. The increased percentage of Ni was due to the contribution of template NF electrode. Hence, the confirmation of various composition of the materials of the catalyst coating in the NF was done using EDX analysis, which is shown in Fig. 3 . Similar to SEM images, the detailed surface characterization was done with the help of TEM and HRTEM images of the nanocomposites. From Fig. 4 , the magnified TEM image clearly validated the crystalline structure of NiCo2O4 like nanosheets distributed along with amorphous rGO. The average size of nano sheets in the composite was 38–60 nm while the higher magnification showed with nano crystallites of 10–30 nm. The HRTEM depicted nano crystallites structure with distance between lattices (0.257 nm) corresponding to lattices of NiCo2O4. XPS analysis was employed to investigate both elemental compositions of the electrode surface and their corresponding oxidation states ascribing the electronic configuration of respective atoms. As presumed and denoted the detailed photo-emission survey spectrum of NiCo2O4.rGO nanocomposite exhibits the peaks conforming the presence of Ni 2p, Co 2p, O 1s and C 1s. Fig. 5 B, de-convolution of Ni 2p peaks indicated the atoms in 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 electronic configuration of Ni atoms at 868.58 eV and 855.41 eV, respectively. Also in Fig. 5C, Co 2p peaks de-convoluted described the presence of Co atoms with electronic configuration in 2p1/2 and 2p2/3 states at 793.69 eV and 779.58 eV. Both 2p spectra of Ni and Co were with two spin-orbit doublets with two shake up satellites individually exhibiting the characteristic of Ni3+ & Ni2+ and Co3+ & Co2+ states, correspondingly. The O 1s peaks with significant M–O–M peak at 529.45 eV, revealed the presence of most oxygen atoms within crystal lattice (oxygen bonded to Ni and Co) whereas the other peaks respective to O–CO and CO bonds, at 530.83 eV and 532.66 eV, represented the oxygen groups of rGO formed due to the incomplete reduction (Fig. 5D). In Fig. 5D, C 1s peak appeared at 287.49 eV, 286.04 eV and 284.16 eV were directly associated with the C–O, C–C and CC of rGO. All the binding energies of these peaks are in good agreement with literature confirming the elemental composition of NiCo2O4.rGO nanocomposites."
10,Cyclic voltammetry and EIS,"3.2 Cyclic voltammetry and EIS Prior to the realistic performance, the performance of catalysts could be analyzed in comparison with control cathode in electrochemical polarization curves obtained as Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). With 50 mM PB as electrolyte for the three electrode system arranged in the electrochemical station, CV at scan rate of 50 mV/s was clearly depicted by the enclosed area more for NCG-NF than NF as represented in Fig. 6 . The onset potential for NCG-NF was observed with clear improvement and sharp increase in current densities in comparison with NF. The value of over potential for NF was −780 mV while NCG-NF was −550 mV under same testing conditions. This drastic improvement on the coated cathode was attributed to enhancement of electrocatalytic property by catalyst additions responsible for faster HER. The current densities at 1.0 V of NF and NCG-NF was 5.2 mA/cm2 and 12.1 mA/cm2 respectively This increase was ascribed by rGO additions and their significance in improving the electrochemical activity for HER [19]. Also reduction in overpotential directly suggested the significant role of the catalyst material impacting the performance of hydrogen production in MEC. From Fig. 7 , it was clearly apparent that NCG-NF exhibited lower ohmic resistance than NF in the Nyquist plots attributing the graphene additions [19]. The first half was responsible for inducing the ions migration on the interface and inner active sites whereas the second part depicted the resistance induced by the charge transfer [29]. The equivalent circuit simulated resistance shown in Fig. 7 for the coated cathode. A small overall resistance was obtained mainly crediting the inclusion of rGO in the nanocomposites extending surface area of foam structure [30,31]. This resistance especially by charge transfer mechanism represented fast HER kinetics due to hybrid cathode than NF [20,32]. The intrinsic catalytic activity of the nanocomposite towards the HER and its application in MEC, investigated by the potentiodynamic studies of fabricated cathodes. This revealed the corrosion behavior of cathodes in the neutral phosphate buffer shown in Fig. 8 . Moreover, all three had more negative corrosion potentials but their Icorrosion were in lower magnitude for the coated cathode than the bare NF, 1.39 μA for NCG-NF and 1.79 μA for NC-NF versus 2.33 μA for NF. Lower corrosion rate of NCG-NF when compared to NC-NF can be related for showing less local galvanic cells due to various loading material on the surface [33]. Prior to realistic studies in MEC, the electrochemical characterizations of fabricated cathodes demonstrated the effect of various catalyst coatings influencing the overall behavior analogous to the further evaluation in the experimentation."
11,Performance evaluation in MEC,"3.3 Performance evaluation in MEC 3.3.1 Substrate degradation Apart from direct performance evaluation of MEC using industrial effluents like SWW, the treatment efficiency i.e. the COD removal efficiency through substrate degradation by microorganisms has also been considered as important aspects with focus of both energy and environment. Considering all batches after few cycles of stabilization, the COD removal efficiency were 58.1% for NCG-NF and 48.7% for NF shown in Fig. 9 . Nearly 10% variation in COD was the main reason for high current density and high hydrogen production rate in NCG-NF. It had been reported with low COD removal in dual chamber reactor using acetate substrate in contrast high COD removal single chamber reactor [34]. The current density was maximum for NCG-NF while NF was 1.25 A/m2, thus NF exhibited 25% lower than the NCG-NF. These current densities were found more relevant with electrochemical analysis. 3.3.2 Hydrogen production rate NCG-NF achieved a higher hydrogen production rate (HPR) in MEC using SWW. As mentioned earlier, these results were in correspondence to the CV, current densities profile of the two cathodes. At applied voltage of 1.0 V, the HPR was 6.08 ± 0.13 mmol/L/D which is equal to 0.14 ± 0.003 L/L/D in the MEC using NCG-NF (Fig. 10 ). In comparison similar rates have been attained in two-chambered MEC using domestic wastewater at 0.5 V (0.02 L/L/D) [35] and using lignocellulose in dual chamber reactor at 0.8 V (2.46 mmol/L/D) [36]. The HPR in the MEC using NCGNF cathode was 3.2 times higher than bare NF using SWW substrate. While the HPR of NC-NF was 3.47 ± 0.10 mmol/L/D nearly half of the graphene included cathode. In dual chamber The control experiments revealed the HPR of 1.63 ± 0.16 mmol/L/D and hence, the catalyst coatings have improved hydrogen production even from real-time low grade effluent substrate. 3.3.3 Coloumbic efficiency, hydrogen recoveries and energy recovery The performance of the MEC reactor could be evaluated based on various expressions with respect to the system. Analogous to the COD removal, coulombic efficiency (CE) of the two MECs were 60.2%, 66.9%for NF and NCG-NF respectively represented in Fig. 11 . During the batch operation, the current measured over time had influenced this incremental CE for the coated cathode. Based on the batch hydrogen production against the measured current, CHR was 27.64% for NCG-NF where 17% for control experiment. This enhanced CHR was clear inference of the higher catalytic activity of the nanocomposite. On overall, OHR had increased from 9.8% of NF to 18.24% of NCG-NF. In comparison with Single Cell MECs, the dual chamber MECs were generally reported with low hydrogen recoveries owing to the presence of membrane with selective permeability [37]."
12,Conclusion,"The fabrication of NF cathode with graphene hybrid nickel cobaltite nanocomposite catalyst was successful in enhancing bio-hydrogen production from an industrial effluent. In dual chamber MEC using SWW, NCG-NF cathode demonstrated better performance in aspects of all recoveries and current based efficiencies, exhibiting high catalytic activity. The structural analysis of both synthesized material and fabricated electrode revealed the improved surface properties accounting its application in MEC for enhanced performance. The performance was associated correspondingly to the electrochemical characterization augmented by the addition of rGO in NiCo2O4. The MEC performance evaluation of bio-hydrogen production was exhibited in terms of coloumbic efficiency, cathodic hydrogen recovery, overall hydrogen recovery and energy efficiency. Coupling high catalytic activity with advantageous properties of graphene had led into enhanced hydrogen recovery from wastewater. At the operating conditions 32 ± 2 °C and applied voltage of 1.0 V, the maximum hydrogen production rate by this novel catalyst was 0.14 ± 0.002 L/L/D. Future perception of this study directs into research of the various combination of low cost metal catalysts and high conducting materials for higher HER and their applications in various design of reactors. The potentiality of MEC technology and its application orientated towards realistic wastewater treatment for clean and green energy tapping is of high substantial exploration with suitable materials development for economical systems."
