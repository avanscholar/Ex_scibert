0,Introduction,"The selective oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds is one of the most important processes for production of various fine and specialty chemicals including drugs, vitamins, and fragrances [1–4]. Many homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have been disclosed, in the area of oxidation of alcohols [5]. Polyoxometalates (POMs) with oxygen clusters of early transition metals have drawn wide attention in the last two decades as effective catalysts for selective oxidation of alcohols. There have been some recent publications [6–8] reporting on alcohol oxidation catalyzed by POMs with oxygen/air as an oxidant, such as Neumann's catalysts of H5[PV2Mo10O40] [6] and [IMo6O24][5–7], Wang's Na6.3Fe0.9[AlMo11O39]·2H2O [8] and so on. In these systems, excellent yields of carbonyl compounds were obtained. However, environmentally undesirable solvents were used, typically such as toluene and acetonitrile. Hydrogen peroxide, as a clean oxidant also attracted much attention for various oxidation reactions catalyzed by d 0-transition metal complexes, such as tungsten-based polyoxometalates. H2O2 was of great advantage to the environment and industry, such as water as the sole by-product, a high content of active oxygen species and the simplicity of handling [9–14]. A key advance to the area of alcohol oxidation was the finding that a water-soluble palladium–phenanthroline catalyst was used in a biphasic reaction medium that allowed liquid alcohols to be oxidized with water as solvent [15,16]. This was a biphasic system, with two immiscible liquid phases, such that the homogeneous catalyst was soluble in the water phase and the products in the organic phase. Such a system has the advantages that the catalyst is easily recycled from the product by separation of the aqueous, and these oxidations performed in water would be considerably safer, cheaper and more environmentally friendly. Therefore, some recent researches involving oxidation of alcohols catalyzed by POMs were based on a system, in which water was used as solvent and hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. For example, Na12[WZnZn2(H2O)2(ZnW9O34)2] [17] and Na6[SiW11ZnH2O40]·2H2O [18] both showed good catalytic activity of alcohol oxidation in water. Herein, we reported the use of easily prepared water-soluble POMs, K8[γ-SiW10O36]·13H2O (I), as an effective pre-catalyst for the selective oxidation of alcohols. Ever since the syntheses of dilacunary K8[γ-SiW10O36]·13H2O [19], the catalytic oxidation activity of K8[γ-SiW10O36]·13H2O has not been reported. We found that the dilacunary silicodecatungstate was a good pre-catalyst for the oxidation of alcohols with H2O2 in water at 363K. Activated benzylic alcohols (such as benzyl alcohol, 1-phenylethanol, benzhydrol and so on) and nonactivated alcohols (such as 2-octanol, 2-pentanol, cyclohexanol, menthol and so on) were all selectively oxidized to the corresponding ketone with >90% yields. We also investigated temperature effect on the oxidation of alcohols catalyzed by K8[γ-SiW10O36]·13H2O in water. It was found that at 293K, most alcohols were selectively oxidized to the corresponding ketone with high yield. It is considerably safe, energy-saving, and green for the room temperature oxidation of various alcohols."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of K8[β2-SiW11O39]·14H2O (according to ref [19]),"2.1 Preparation of K8[β2-SiW11O39]·14H2O (according to ref [19]) Sodium metasilicate (2.2g, 10mmol) was dissolved in 20mL of water (Solution A). Sodium tungstate (36.4g, 0.11mol) was dissolved in 60mL of water in a separate 250mL beaker containing a magnetic stirring bar. To this solution, 33mL of 4M HCl was added in 1mL portions over 10min, with vigorous stirring (there was local formation of hydrated tungstic acid that slowly disappears). Then, solution A was poured into the tungstate solution, and the pH was adjusted to between 5 and 6 by addition of the 4M HCl solution (∼8mL). This pH was maintained by addition of small amounts of 4M HCl for 100min. Solid potassium chloride (18g) was then added to the solution with gentle stirring. After 15min, the precipitate was collected by filtering through a sintered glass filter. Purification was achieved by dissolving the product in 170mL of water. The insoluble material was rapidly removed by filtration on a funnel, and the salt was precipitated again by addition of solid KCl (16g). The precipitate was separated by filtration, washed with 2M potassium chloride solution (2 portions of 10mL), and air dried. Yield: 12.9g (40%). IR spectrum (KBr, cm−1): 991, 950, 879, 863, 803, 728, 610, 532, 513, 397, 360, 322 and 270."
3,Preparation of K8[γ-SiW10O36]·13H2O (according to ref [19]),"2.2 Preparation of K8[γ-SiW10O36]·13H2O (according to ref [19]) The potassium salt of the β2 isomer of undecatungstosilicate (5g, 1.67mmol) was dissolved in 50mL of water maintained at 25°C. Impurities in the K8[β2-SiW11O39] salt gave insoluble materials, which have to be removed rapidly by filtration on a funnel. The pH of the solution was quickly adjusted to 9.1 by addition of a 2M aqueous solution of K2CO3. The pH of the solution was kept at this value by addition of the K2CO3 solution for exactly 16min. The potassium salt of the γ-decatungstosilicate was then precipitated by addition of solid potassium chloride (13.3g). During the precipitation (10min), the pH must be maintained at 9.1 by addition of small amounts of the K2CO3 solution. The solid was removed by filtering, washed with 1M KCl solution, and air dried. Yield: 3.2g (64%). IR spectrum (KBr, cm−1): 990, 946, 907, 865, 817, 742, 654, 554, 525, 479, 393, 361, 323, 279 and 250. 29Si MAS NMR (79.5MHz): −85.0ppm (see Supporting information)."
4,Characterization techniques,"2.3 Characterization techniques Infrared spectra of heteropolyoxotungstates were recorded on a Nicolet NEXUS 670 FT-IR spectrometer. The catalysts were measured using 2–4% (w/w) KBr pellets prepared by manual grinding. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 9.4T on a Bruker Avance-400 wide bore spectrometer. The 29Si MAS NMR spectra of solid catalyst with cross-polarization were performed at 79.5MHz with BB (broad band) MAS probe head using 4mm ZrO2 rotors and 2ms constant time and 3s repetition time and 11,600 scans, with samples spun at 10kHz and referenced to SiMe4. Thermogravimetry (TG) was performed by using a TA Instrument 2050 thermogravimetric analyzer under nitrogen (20.0mLmin−1) with a heating rate of 10Kmin−1. GC analyses were performed on Shimadzu GC-9AM with a flame ionization detector equipped with SE-54 capillary (internal diameter=0.25mm, length=30m). Mass spectra were recorded on Finnigan Trace DSQ (Thermo Electron Corporation) at an ionization voltage of 70eV equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (internal diameter=0.25mm, film thickness=0.25μm, length=30m). Chemical elemental analysis of the catalysts was done on an ICP-atomic emission spectrometer (IRIS ER/S)."
5,Catalytic reaction,"2.4 Catalytic reaction The catalytic reactions were performed in a 10mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, and a reflux condenser. The oxidation was carried out as follows: catalyst, water (2mL), substrate (1mmol), and H2O2 (30% aq, 5mmol) were charged in the reaction flask. The reaction was carried out at 363K and detected by TLC accompanied with GC. When the reaction was over, the organic products were separated from the aqueous phase by extraction with ethyl acetate and then the organic layer was analyzed by GC with the internal standard method. Assignments of products were made by comparison with authentic samples. Selected products were also analyzed by GC/MS (Finnigan Trace DSQ), 1H NMR and 13C NMR. After separation of product, re-addition of alcohols (1mmol) and H2O2 (30% aq.) to the aqueous phase containing the catalyst was carried out for the next oxidation cycle."
6,Results and discussion,"Initially, oxidation of cyclohexanol was carried out with various catalysts in water at 363K (Table 1 ). K8[γ-SiW10O36]·13H2O exhibited the highest activity among the catalysts and the corresponding ketone was obtained in 95% yield (entry 1). The reaction did not proceed in the absence of the catalysts (entry 6). As shown in Table 1, the poor yields of cyclohexanone were obtained in the presence of simple Na2WO4·2H2O, Na2SiO3·9H2O, and the mixture of Na2WO4·2H2O and Na2SiO3·9H2O (entries 3–5). In addition, the catalytic activity of dodecatungstosilicate of K4[SiW12O40] was poor for the oxidation of cyclohexanol. The pre-catalyst dilacunary silicodecatungstate, K8[γ-SiW10O36]·13H2O, could be applicable to oxidation of various alcohols (such as benzylic alcohols and secondary alcohols) with 30% H2O2 at 363K and the results were listed in Table 2 . For the hydrophilic alcohols such as isopropanol, 2-butanol, 2-pentanol, cyclopentanol and cyclohexanol, high yields and selectivities were obtained under reaction condition. However, it was necessary to add some phase-transfer catalyst (20μmol π-C5H5N(CH2)15CH3Cl) to the reaction system, in which some hydrophobic alcohols such as 2-octanol and menthol were used as substrates. Otherwise, the reactions hardly proceeded for those long-chain alcohols and hydrophobic alcohols (entries 4 and 8). Because the reaction rate was determined by the solubility of the alcohols in water, the reaction rate gradually decreases for long-chain alcohols. There was little discernible effect of the hydrophobicity of the substrates, although not surprisingly the benzylic substrates were more reactive as compared with that of linear aliphatic and cyclic alcohols (entries 10–13). Benzyl alcohol was completely converted to benzoic acid after 7h at 363K, when the molar ratio of H2O2 to benzyl alcohol was 5:1 (entry 10). When the temperature of the reaction was dropped from 363K to 343K and the molar ratio of H2O2 to benzyl alcohol was decreased to 1:1, benzaldehyde as the only oxidation product was obtained (entry 11). To gain more insight into the catalytic system, we studied the oxidation of alcohols catalyzed by K8[γ-SiW10O36]·13H2O with 30% H2O2 in water at room temperature (293K) and the results were shown in Table 3 . When reaction temperature dropped from 363K to 293K, longer time and more amount of catalyst were needed to achieve good yield. The water-soluble alcohols, for example, isopropanol, 2-butanol, cyclopentanol and cyclohexanol, were transformed to the corresponding ketone specifically with 100% selectivity and >90% yield (entries 1–2, 5–6). For those benzylic alcohols such as benzyl alcohol (entry 7) and 1-phenylethanol (entry 8), moderate yields of carbonyl compounds were obtained after 3day reaction at 293K. Benzaldehyde as the sole oxidation product was obtained for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (entry 7). For the long-chain aliphatic alcohol, 2-octanol, although the reaction went on 3days, only 7% yield of octan-2-one was achieved. The data in Tables 2 and 3 indicated that the high reaction temperature and the good water-solubility of alcohols resulted in high yields of carbonyl compounds. To evaluate the stability and reuse of the pre-catalyst of K8[γ-SiW10O36]·13H2O, we investigated the recycled catalysts in the cyclohexanol oxidation reaction. One process was carried out at 293K (Table 4 ) and another was at 363K (Table 5 ). The recycling reaction was carried out as follows: in the alcohol/water biphasic system, the catalyst dissolved in water and oxidized alcohols. After reaction, the organic products were separated from the aqueous phase by extraction with ethyl acetate and the organic phase was analyzed by GC with the internal standard method. The aqueous phase containing the catalyst was kept to do the next oxidation. Because the catalyst was still dissolved in water after extraction, there was no need for adding new catalyst and new solvent for the next reaction. To the aqueous phase, re-addition of alcohols and H2O2 was sufficient for the next oxidation. The catalytic activity and selectivity in oxidation of cyclohexanol on pre-catalyst for different cycles were shown in Tables 4 and 5. When the reaction was performed at room temperature, there was no discernible activity loss even after five consecutive recycling (Table 4). The reactions were carried out for four cycles at 363K without appreciable loss in activity, but the product yield decreased from 93% to 70% for the fifth recycle (Table 5). The decrease in activity may be due to the structure change for the fifth recycled catalyst. The fresh catalysts and the used ones were characterized with FT-IR spectra. As shown in Fig.1 the IR spectrum of fresh pre-catalyst K8[γ-SiW10O36]·13H2O (Fig.1a) exhibits characteristic peaks at 990, 946, 907, 865, 817, 742, 654, 554, 525, 479 and 393cm−1 similar to the reference reports [17]. Fig. 1 shows IR spectra of the fresh and recycled catalysts with different reaction temperatures. IR spectra of the two used catalysts (Fig. 1b and d) for cycle 1 are very similar, but either of them is different from the fresh one (Fig. 1a). There were obvious differences between the IR spectra of the fresh catalyst I and the used ones; several peaks were moved to a new position at 560,615, 805, 855 and 920cm−1 and the band strength increased much, indicating that the structure of the pre-catalyst was changed. The spectra of the recycled catalysts for cycles 1 and 5 (Fig. 1b and c) at 293K are very similar, which suggest that structure of recycled catalyst does not change and that they are stable since catalytic recycling at room temperature. However, compared with the FT-IR spectra of used recycled catalysts for cycles 1 and 5 at 363K (Fig 1d and e), some difference was observed, indicating that the high temperature affected the structure of the catalyst. This is the reason for the decreased activity of used catalyst (Fig. 1e) for cycle 5 at 363K."
7,Conclusions,"A water-soluble dilacunary silicotungstate, K8[γ-SiW10O36]·13H2O, was an effective and recyclable pre-catalyst for alcohol oxidation with H2O2 in biphasic reaction media. Various alcohols (such as benzylic alcohols and secondary alcohols) were converted to the corresponding carbonyl compounds with high yields and selectivity. Since catalytic recycling, the pre-catalyst changed into another stable compound according to IR analysis, especially for the room temperature reaction."
