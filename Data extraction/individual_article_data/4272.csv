0,Introduction,"From past few years Ionic Liquids (ILs) are considered to be relatively new area of investigation. ILs being comparatively “green” solvents are associated with their unique properties showing viable applications in various fields of research as well as for industrial use. Owing to this, there is great demand to rely on thermophysical data of pure ILs and their binary mixtures. Binary mixtures of ILs with molecular solvents find numerous applications in absorption systems, extraction processes, catalysis and synthesis processes [1–5]. The volumetric and acoustical properties of solutions with ILs are very important for the interpretation of various intermolecular interactions viz. solute-solute, solute-solvent, and various non-covalent interactions like hydrogen bonding, ion-dipole and dipole-dipole. Their use in polar and non-polar systems generates new chemistries. The apparent and partial molal properties are very much useful in understanding bonding pattern in solutions [6–9]. The importance of these studies lies in elucidating structural and unique properties of ILs solutions. These properties of ILs rely on structure of IL, hydration (ion-solvation, ion-association etc.), packing effects and structural contributions. Among all, ammonium based ILs are relatively green solvents. Numerous studies have been conducted on solution properties, especially volumetric properties of ammonium based salts. Keshapolla et al. [10] have determined apparent molar properties of benzyldimethylammonium based ILs in DMF. The calculated V ∅ ∞ and K ∅ ∞ values revealed that in DMF there is stronger ionic liquid-molecular solvent interactions for benzyldimethylammonium hexanoate (BDMAH) than for benzyldimethylammonium propionate (BDMAP). In another study the same authors have reported the apparent molar properties of three benzyldimethylammonium based ILs specifically benzyldimethylammonium acetate (BDMAA), benzyldimethylammonium propionate (BDMAP) and benzyldimethylammonium hexanoate (BDMAH) in ethanol and water [11]. The calculated parameters at infinite dilution showed BDMAA-ethanol interactions to be the strongest. Choline based IL and physico-chemical data of their binary mixtures are relatively less studied [12]. These ILs are termed as most green, inexpensive and biodegradable in nature as compared to traditionally used imidazolium and pyridinium based ILs [13]. Due to these properties, Choline based ILs attracts great number of applications in organic chemistry, electrochemistry, physical chemistry and engineering [14]. Their use in enzymatic production of biodiesel [15], organic synthesis [16], biosensensing and biomaterials [17,18], and catalysis [3] attract many researchers at academic as well as industrial level. Choline Acetate (Scheme 1 ) is choline derivative based IL, biocompatible and has good lipase activity [19]. Up to now, there is no systematic documentation for molecular interactions of Choline Acetate with H-bond donor solvents. It is of paramount interest to understand the structural behaviour of Choline Acetate with the traditional solvents. Variation of dielectric constants of solvents leads to better understanding of intermolecular interactions in solutions [20–22]. The straight chain alcohols are found to be less toxic and are important industrial ingredients [23,24]. In the present report, we have studied the thermophysical parameters viz. density ρ, ultrasonic sound velocity u, refractive index n D , and specific conductivity ˄ m of Choline Acetate in organic rich regions. To gain insight the molecular interactions, apparent molar properties such as apparent molar volume V ϕ , apparent molar compressibilities K Sϕ , apparent molar volume at infinite dilution V ϕ 0, limiting apparent molar expansibilities ϕ E 0, limiting isentropic compression K Sϕ 0 of Choline Acetate with ethanol, propanol and butanol have been calculated. Further studies have been verified by refractometry and conductivity measurements. DFT studies were also in consonance with the above results."
1,Materials and procedure,
2,Materials used,"2.1 Materials used The Choline Acetate i.e. 2-hydroxyethyl-trimethylammonium acetate [(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] was delivered from Sigma-Aldrich. Before performing the experiments, IL was kept for drying in desiccator to cease the entry of meagre amounts of water and other impurities. The Ethanol (percentage purity >99.9%) has been purchased from Changshu Yang Yuan chemical, China. The propanol and butanol with mass percent purity >99.0% have been purchased from merck. The percentage purity of available chemicals are given in Table 1 . The temperature dependent densities ρ, ultrasonic sound velocity u, specific conductivity κ and refractive index n D [24] values of pure solvents are given in Table 2 ."
3,Procedure,"2.2 Procedure The clear solutions of [(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + {[Ethanol, Propanol and Butanol]} were made afresh by weighing the components using a Mettler Toledo balance with an accuracy of ±1.10− 4 g. The temperature dependent thermophysical parameters i.e. density ρ and ultrasonic sound velocity u, measurements of binary mixtures of [(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] with alcohols over various composition range were carried out using Anton Paar DSA 5000 densimeter and ultrasonic sound velocity analyser. After mixing the components, the sample aliquots were injected into the U-tube of densimeter. The desired temperature has been controlled by in-built thermostat with precision better than ±1 × 10− 3 K. The repeatability in digits for density and ultrasonic sound velocity measurements were ±1 × 10−6g·cm− 3 and ±1 × 10−2m·s− 1, respectively. The ambiguities in density and ultrasonic sound velocity measurements are presumed to be less than 5 × 10−6g·cm− 3 and 5 × 10−2m·s− 1 respectively. Refractive index n D measurements have been determined using an Abbemat 500 Automatic refractometer with precision of ±2 × 10−5 and resolution of 1 × 10−6. Refractometer was calibrated by measuring n D values of high purity distilled water. A bubble-free sample was introduced in refractometer and measured using temperature controlled in-built thermostat having resolution 0.01 K and precision of 0.03 K. The specific conductivity ˄ m of binary mixtures of [(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] with alcohols over wide composition range and at variable temperatures (293.15 to 323.15) K conditions was measured using systronics conductivity meter 306 operating at 100 Hz. A thermostatically controlled (model F 33, julabo), well-stirred circulating water bath was used to carry out the measurements with an uncertainty of ±0.01 K. The uncertainty in specific conductance measurements were less than 2 × 10−6S·m− 1 with an error limit of conductance measurements was ±3%."
4,Results and discussions,"The molecular interaction in binary mixtures can be elucidated by measuring densities ρ and ultrasonic sound velocity u values for solutions of {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + {Ethanol, Propanol and Butanol}} as a function of [(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] over the wide concentration range and temperature varying from (293.15 to 323.15) K at atmospheric pressure. In Tables 3 and 4 the experimental density ρ and ultrasonic sound velocity u values for the solutions of {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + {Ethanol, 1-Propanol and 1-Butanol}} have been summarised. From the Figs. S1 and S2, we can infer that the density ρ and ultrasonic sound velocity u values of the studied three systems increase with increase in concentration of [(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] and decrease with increase in temperature. For more clarity an analogy for ρ and u values of the studied three systems at 25 °C has been made and presented in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The results clearly show that the density and ultrasonic sound velocity values for ethanol system are the lowest as compared to propanol and butanol systems due increase in –CH2 unit in higher alcohols. The measured density ρ values have been used to compute apparent molar volumes V ϕ by virtue of the following equation [11,26]: (1) V ϕ = M ρ − ρ − ρ o m × ρ × ρ o where ρ and ρ o are respectively the densities of binary solution and pure solvents (ethanol, propanol and butanol) and M and m are the molar mass and molality of IL {which is amount of solute in specific amount of solvent (mol/kg)} respectively. Apparent molar volume is the geometric sum of the volumes contributed by solute-solute and that of solute-solvent interactions. The values of V ϕ determined as a function of concentration of IL and temperature for the binary mixtures of {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + {Ethanol, 1-Propanol and 1-Butanol}} have been summarised in Table S1. Choline Acetate is exceptionally soluble in short chain alcohols. For the studied mixtures, the positive V ϕ values over the entire concentrations and wide temperature range (Fig. 2 ), indicating strong solute-molecular solvent interactions. The values of V ϕ decrease in order: {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + Ethanol} > {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + 1-Propanol} > {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + 1-butanol} due to increase in –CH2 unit with increase in alkyl chain of alcohols (Fig. 3(a)) thereby increasing hydrophobicity of alcohols and decreasing the solute-molecular solvent interactions [27]. Also, it can be examined that the magnitude of interactions decreases with increase in concentration but are being further consolidated with increase in temperatures. At low IL concentration, ions of Choline Acetate are surrounded by solvent molecules leading to increase in ion-solvent interactions. Whereas, at high IL concentrations the solute-molecular solvent (ion-solvent) interactions are being replaced by solute-solute interactions. Further, with the additional –CH2 group in bulkier solvent, because of longer alkyl chain length of alcohol the “van der Waals interaction” between butanol molecules are strongest and hence it is more unfavourable for butanol molecules to form solute-molecular solvent interactions [28,29]. The values of activity coefficients increase with increase in chain length of alcohols. Larger activity coefficients are indication of repulsive solute-solvent interactions. [27]. However, with increasing temperatures there is rapid expulsion of solvent molecules from the solvation layers to the bulk resulting in increase in volume of solution [30]. At infinite dilution the apparent molar volume can be quantitatively determined using following Masson equation: (2) V ∅ = V ∅ o + S v ∗ m where V ϕ 0 is apparent molar volume at infinite dilution. It is a measure of solute-molecular solvent interaction parameter when both the ions in Choline Acetate are set apart from each other at an infinitely larger distance and are enclosed by the solvent molecules only. S v ∗ is experimental slope which is also an estimate of combination-wise interactivity of the solvated moieties in solution [31], m is the molality of solution The values are negative for S v ∗, whereas the values for V ϕ 0 are large and positive (Table 5 ), for all the studied three systems within the temperature range (298.15 to 313.15 K). These results reflect that solute-molecular solvent interactions are overpowering the solute-solute interactions. With the increase in temperatures, the loosely bound solvent molecules set free from the solvated sphere of solute to the solution due to increase in solute-molecular solvent interactions. [32]. The temperature dependent behaviour of V ϕ 0 for the studied system is expressed by following equation: (3) V ∅ 0 = a + bT + c T 2 where T is the absolute temperature and a, b, c are the empirical constants. The constants a, b, c was calculated using least square fitting method of V ϕ 0 in above equation and following equations are originated: (4) V ϕ 0 = 557.3997 − 2.51866 T + 0.00449 T 2 , for C 2 H 4 OH − CH 3 3 N ] [ Acetate + ethanol (5) V ϕ 0 = 410.17106 − 1.51614 T + 0.00276 T 2 , for C 2 H 4 OH − CH 3 3 N ] [ Acetate + propanol (6) V ϕ 0 = 387.67205 − 1.37032 T + 0.0025 T 2 , for C 2 H 4 OH − CH 3 3 N ] [ Acetate + butanol By differentiating Eqs. (4), (5) and (6) w.r.t. temperature the limiting apparent molar expansibilities ϕ E 0 values at infinite dilution can be evaluated as: (7) ∅ E o = ∂ V ∅ O ∂ T P = b + 2 cT ϕ E 0 Values are relatively important with regard to solvation properties. These values give the knowledge about the tendency of structure making (“Kosmotropic solute”) and structure breaking (“Chaotropic solutes”) characteristics of solute [33]. The values for ϕ E 0 are positive (Table S2) and increase along with the increase in temperature for all the three systems which shows the structure making properties of Choline Acetate in three solvents i.e. ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol [34]. However the structure making ability of Choline Acetate limits as the alkyl chain length of alcohols increases. There is indication of “saturation effect” in structure making ability by alcohols and ammonium ions [35]. In Fig. 4 , larger ϕ E 0 values for ethanol system indicates more structure making effect of Choline Acetate in ethanol in comparison to higher alcohols [35]. The qualitative knowledge regarding structure making and structure breaking characteristics of solute was achieved by examining the second derivative of limiting apparent molar volume of solute i.e. ∂ 2 V ∅ 0 ∂ T 2 (Hepler's constant) for the studied systems. The positive values of Hepler's constant [36] confirm the structure making nature of the Choline Acetate in Ethanol, 1-Propanol and 1-Butanol. The thermal expansion coefficient values are computed as follows: (8) α ∗ = 1 V φ o ∂ V ∅ o ∂ T P The thermal expansion coefficient is very important criterion to determine solute-solvent interactions at different temperatures. The calculated values of thermal expansion coefficients α ∗ have been summarised in Table S2. The thermal expansion coefficient α ∗ for the studied binary mixtures follows the order {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + Ethanol} > {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + 1-Propanol} > {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + 1-butanol} (Fig. 4). This shows that interactions between solute and molecular solvent are the strongest in ethanol than propanol and butanol. The thermal expansion coefficient depend on the type of solutes, the number and position of functional centres; as well as to type of molecular skeletal; open or cyclic. Thermal expansion coefficient depends on temperature range of H bonded solvent also. The thermal expansion coefficients in liquids are interpreted in terms of volumetric expansion with temperature for determining solute-solvent interactions. As already interpreted from above that Choline Acetate in ethanol shows more structure making effect (packing/caging/hydrophobic effect or more ion solvent interactions). The characteristic of such effect is that with the increase in temperatures, the solvent molecules are quickly released from the solvation layers causing more expansion (in ethanol) than in the rest of other two systems. As the {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + Ethanol} mixtures have more structure making effect so the thermal expansion coefficient is high. This is how the temperature dependence of thermal expansion coefficients determines the ion-solvent interactions [37]. Using experimentally measured ρ and u values, the isentropic apparent molar compressibilities have been computed by means of following equation [20,38]. (9) K s ∅ = k s × M ρ − k s o × ρ − k s × ρ o m × ρ × ρ o where k s and k s o are the isentropic compressibilities coefficient of solution and solvent respectively, M and m are respectively the molar mass and molality of IL. The values of isentropic compressibilities k s have been computed as: (10) k s = 1 u 2 × ρ . As shown in Fig. 5 , the apparent molar isentropic compressibilities decrease with increase in concentrations of ILs for all three systems, which is an indicative of solute-solvent interaction on addition of IL in alcohol. This is due to the increase in hydrophobic solvation [39]. The apparent molar isentropic compressibilities values decrease on going from lower to higher alcohols and follows the order {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + Ethanol} > {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + 1-Propanol} > {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + 1-butanol} as shown in (Fig. 3(b) at 25 °C). The least compressibilities in butanol system may be due to combined effect of electrostrictive solvation of anion along with hydrophobic effect [36]. There is increase in electrostrictive solvation of anion with increase in –CH2 unit of alcohols [40]. In {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + Ethanol} mixtures, most of the solvent molecules i.e. ethanol molecules are involved in structure making (caging or hydrophobic effect) with the Choline Acetate IL but in butanol mixtures there is less structure ordering effect (caging or hydrophobic effect) so the electrostriction of acetate anion (due to delocalisation of single negative charge over two oxygen atoms) becomes more prominent along with hydrophobic effect. With increase in temperature the solute molecules release from the solvent shell [41] due to increase in thermal disorderness resulting in increase in K Sϕ values (Fig. 5). Further, the limiting molar isentropic compressibilities values have been evaluated using the equation follows as [36]: (11) K s , ∅ = K ∅ ∞ + S k × m where S k the experimental slope and m is molality of solution. The calculated K ∅ ∞values have been summarised in Table 6 . The limiting apparent molar compressibilities is the sum of two effects (i) solvent intrinsic compressibility (positive effect) which results in overall compression of the solution due to the free space present in between the molecules in the solution (ii) solute intrinsic compressibility (negative effect) which is due to the intrusion of solvent molecules into intraionic free space available in solute molecules [42]. The increase in limiting apparent molar isentropic compression with temperature (Table 6) may be due to domination of solvent intrinsic compressibility which overshadows the solute intrinsic compressibility or penetration effect. The low values of limiting apparent molar compression at low temperatures may be because to resistance offered by hydrophobicity of the molecular solvent around the solute than the total bulk solvent [41]. Refractive Index is significant thermophysical property which gives us the additional knowledge regarding the extent of intermolecular interactions in solutions. The refractive index values for the studied three systems are given in Table 7 and plotted in Fig. S3. The true understanding of interactions by refractive index can be interpreted in terms of Polarizability. Molar refraction R M has been calculated from Lorentz and Lorenz formula (12) R M = n D 2 − 1 n D 2 + 2 . M ρ where M is the molecular weight of Choline Acetate, ρ is the density of the solutions and n D is the refractive index of the solution [43 44]. A comparison of refractive index n D values for the studied three systems at 25 °C have been made as shown in Fig. 1(c). Generally, we define polarizability as the molecular property describing the nature of intermolecular forces among non-polar molecules. It can be calculated using the following expression: (13) α = 3 . R M 4 ΠN where N is the Avogadro's number and α is the electronic polarizability. The molar refraction and polarizability values have been summarised in Tables S3 and S4 respectively for the studied three systems. From the Table S4, we can see that the polarizability follows the order {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + Ethanol} < {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + 1-Propanol} < {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + 1-butanol}. The polarizability and molar refraction decreases as the solvent becomes more polar. Polarsability can depend on many factors (size of the molecule, functional groups attached and their effect on molecule, electron density and hold of nuclear charge over the electrons etc) but in these studies this may be due to the weak dispersion forces arising from cumulative dipole-dipole interaction resulting in decrease in molar refraction and polarizability [45,46]. In the most polar {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + Ethanol} system due to more dipole- dipole interactions there is a weak dispersion force as compared to in {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + 1-butanol} system (less dipole –dipole interactions, more dispersion force, more polarsability). In general, molecular polarsability can be result of either of two contributions; one is the ease with which the molecules are deformed under the influence of electric field and other is the orientation of molecular dipoles under the influence of this field. On the basis of steric character it is proposed that dipole in the compound lies perpendicular to the longer axis of the molecule which shows intermolecular attraction accompanied by increase in molar polarsability constant. The experimental specific conductivities ^ m of binary mixtures of {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + Ethanol, Propanol and Butanol} have been measured at varying composition range at different temperatures (273.15 to 323.15) K and are summarised in Table 8 . Fig. S4 shows values of ^ m as a function of concentration of the IL in ethanol, propanol and butanol. There is increase in ^ m values with increase in concentration as well as with temperature for all the three systems. However, the comparison of ^ m values at 25 °C follows the order {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + Ethanol} > {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + 1-Propanol} > {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + 1-butanol} as shown in Fig. 1d. The above observations can be explained on the basis of solvents relative permittivity ∈ as solvent dissociates ionic liquid into its respective cation and anion. Effect of solvents on conductance of IL can be clearly seen from the Fig. 1(d). The ^ m values increase with increase in ∈ due to increase in ion-molecular solvent interactions. The miscibility of ILs is better with the solvents having high solvent permittivity. In the present investigation, molar conductance increases in solvents with high permittivity i.e. in ethanol due to balance the electrostatic interactions between cation and anion of ionic liquids and due to this ionization of IL [22]. Further to account for solute-solvent interactions limiting molar conductance of Choline Acetate in alcohols have been calculated by using Mahiuddin and Ismail expression. (14) ˄ m = ^ m o exp A ^ m + B ^ m 2 where m is the concentration in molality, ^ m o is the molar conductance at infinite dilution of Choline Acetate in alcohols and A ^ and B ^are the constant parameters. The ^ m values are fitted by least square fitting method [47]. The molar conductance at infinite dilution can be used to explore solute solvent interactions. Greater magnitude of molar conductance at infinite dilution is an indicative of strong solute-solvent interactions. Solvents forming 3-D networks (water, alcohols) surround the hydrophobic organic ions in clathrate like structures and therefore solvated radii of these complex ions is different from that in other organic solvents [48]. With increase in temperatures due to the thermal agitation resulting in solvent molecules being released from solute involving structural changes resulting in increase in mobility of ions as well as the limiting molar conductance at infinite dilution [49]. The ^ m o values with their fitting constants A ^ and B ^ have been summarised in Table S5. The ^ m o values follows the order {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + Ethanol} > {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + 1-Propanol} > {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + 1-butanol} indicating solute solvent interactions are highest in {[(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + ethanol system. Hence specific conductance results are also in agreement with the other thermophysical parameter."
5,Theoretical study for the effect of short chain alcohols on the structure of Choline Acetate,"Density functional theory calculations were carried out for better understanding and supporting experimental observations on Choline Acetate in lower alcohols. The solvation effect of ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butaanol on structural features of Choline Acetate have been investigated at B3LYP/6-31 g (d,p) [50–54] level of theory using IEFPCM model of solvation using Gaussian 09 computational package [55]. The interaction energy for the formation of Choline Acetate was calculated in ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol using following equation (15) E = E AC − E A + E C where EAC, EA and EC are energies of the Choline Acetate, choline cation and acetate anion in different solvents respectively, and E is the interaction energy. The calculated interaction energies values have been summarised in Table 9 . The calculations showed that the interaction energy between respective Choline cation and acetate anion in ethanol is lowest 27.55 kcal/mol, while for 1-butanol the interaction energy is highest i.e. 29.24 kcal/mol. Thus, we can say that due to this lesser interaction energy, choline cation and acetate anions have more freedom in ethanol due to greater solute-solvent interactions leading to higher degree of structural modifications or arrangements for Choline Acetate. Whereas in 1-butanol and 1-propanol, the interaction energy between choline cation and acetate anions is more as compared to that in ethanol. Thus it can be inferred from above that due to increase in –CH2 unit with increase in alkyl chain of alcohols the solute-solvent interactions have been replaced by solute-solute interactions."
6,Conclusions,"From the thermophysical studies it has been clearly revealed that the Choline Acetate shows more solute-solvent interactions in mixtures of [(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + Ethanol. The larger ϕ E 0 values for ethanol system indicates more structure making effect of IL in ethanol than in propanol and butanol due to more Vander waal interactions between the additional –CH2 group in higher alcohols. The decrease in apparent molar compressibilities with increase in concentration is more for the mixtures of [(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + Butanol due to more prominent electrostrictive solvation along with the hydrophobic effect. Further, the calculated molar refraction reveal the presence of weak dispersion forces in [(C2H4OH)-(CH3)3N] [Acetate] + Ethanol mixtures due to cumulative dipole-dipole interaction. Also the molar conductance at infinite dilution increases with temperatures showing the strengthening of solute-molecular solvent interactions. The theoretical calculations using density functional theory calculations support the observation the more structure making ability of Choline Acetate in ethanol than in 1-propanol and 1-butanol in terms of their interaction energies."
