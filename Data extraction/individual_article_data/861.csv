0,Introduction,"Thermophysical properties for pure liquids and liquid mixtures have both practical and theoretical interests. The accurate knowledge of relevant properties is required for process design purposes [1], thus having a pivotal role for optimum design and energy saving [2]. Likewise, thermophysical data are used for validation of predictive models [3,4], such as equations of state [5], which are commonly used in process design software(s) for addressing the needs and challenges of chemical industry [6]. Furthermore, specific intermolecular interactions can be analyzed in complex liquid mixtures through the composition evolution of relevant physicochemical properties and derived properties such as excess ones [7,8], which quantify deviations from ideality. Therefore, the available literature has shown how measurements of thermodynamic and transport properties have been adequately employed for the understanding of the nature physicochemical behavior and intermolecular forces in complex liquid mixtures, which should be of great relevance form hydrogen bonded fluids [9–23]. The analysis and understanding of nature of intermolecular forces in complex liquid mixtures is a difficult task considering the large number of facts controlling their properties and their relationships with the chemical composition of the involved mixtures. Therefore, a systematic approach is required considering molecular level features, for which different classes of molecules should be approached. Alcohols are a family of compounds widely used in the chemical industry [24] and for applications such as biofuels [25]. The presence in alcohols of hydroxyl groups, which may act both as hydrogen donor and acceptor [26], leads to complex effects rising from hydrogen bonding changes upon mixing [27]. Glycerol (1,2,3-propanetriol, GLY) is an important alcohol extensively used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries [28] because of its nontoxic [29] and good solvent properties, which has been widely used for dissolving many organic and inorganic materials [30]. The presence of three hydroxyl groups in GLY structure has been widely used for tuning mixture properties when GLY is present as cosolvent [31,32]. In the present study, a combined experimental and theoretical study on the properties of binary mixtures of GLY with 2-butanol (2BUT), 2,3-butanediol (23BD) isobutanol (2-methyl-1-propanol, 2M1P) or benzyl alcohol (BA), Fig. 1 , is reported as a function of mixture composition, in the full composition range, and temperature. The objective of the work is to analyze the micro and macroscopic features of alcohol + alcohol complex liquid mixtures in terms of hydrogen bonding properties. The experimental thermophysical properties allow a macroscopic characterization of the mixed fluids, whereas the theoretical study, through a combination of quantum chemistry (Density Functional Theory, DFT) and classical molecular dynamics simulations (MD), give insights into the nanoscopic features of the mixed fluids and the characteristics of hydrogen bonding, considering structural and dynamic approaches."
1,Methods,
2,Experimental study,"2.1 Experimental study Pure solvents were obtained from commercial suppliers (GLY, mass fraction ≥ 0.99, Merck; 2BUT, mass fraction ≥ 0.99, Merck; 23BD, mass fraction > 0.98, Merck; 2M1P, mass fraction ≥ 0.99, Merck; BA, mass fraction ≥ 0.995, Merck) and used without further purification. The purity of the alcohols was verified by comparison of experimental properties with literature data [9–23], Table S1 (Supplementary information), thus showing suitable agreement. Density and speed of sound for pure liquids and binary mixtures were measured using an Anton Paar DSA 5000 vibrating U-tube densimeter and sound analyzer, with a precision of ±1·10−6 g ⋅ cm−3 and ±0.1 m ⋅ s−1, respectively. This equipment automatically corrects the influence of viscosity on the measured density. Two integrated Pt 100 resistance thermometers together with peltier elements provide a good precision in internally controlled temperature (±1·10−3 K) [16]. The apparatus calibration was carried out with double distilled water and dry air under atmospheric pressure. Before the measurements, all the samples were degassed (20 min) with ultrasound (MISONIX Ultrasonic Liquid Processors). Liquid mixtures were prepared by mass using an analytical balance (SartoriusTE124S) to ± 1·10−4 g and kept in sealed flasks, leading to an estimated mole fraction uncertainty of ±1·10−4. The experimental uncertainties in the density and speed of sound are estimated to ±5·10−6 g cm−3 and ±0.05 m s−1, respectively. Experimental density and speed of sound data were used to calculate excess volume, VE , isentropic compressibility, k S , and excess isentropic compressibility, k S E , thermal expansion coefficient, α p , and excess thermal expansion coefficient, α p E . Excess functions were fitted as a function of mixture composition according to Redlich-Kister equation. Likewise, partial molar volume, V i ‾ , partial molar volume at infinite dilution V ‾ i ∞ , and excess partial molar volume at infinite dilution V ‾ i E , ∞ , were calculated. The equations and details for the calculation of all excess and derived properties are reported as Supplementary information."
3,Molecular modelling,"2.2 Molecular modelling Intermolecular interactions were firstly analyzed by DFT calculations using ORCA program [33] with B3LYP [34–36] functional and 6–311++G(d,p) basis set, and dispersion contribution according to semiempirical Grimme's method (DFT-D3) [37]. Structural relaxation was carried out for monomers and for GLY + {2BUT or 23BD or 2M1P or BA} 1:1 dimers, considering the different hydrogen bonding sites. Interaction energies, ΔE, for the considered dimers were calculated as the energy difference between the dimer energy and the sum of the corresponding monomers, with basis set superposition error corrected according to counterpoise procedure [38]. Infrared spectra were also calculated for discarding the presence of negative frequencies. Topological analysis of hydrogen bonding was carried out using Bader's Atoms in a Molecule theory (AIM [39]) using MULTIWFN software [40]. Classical MD simulations were carried out with MDynaMix v.5.2 [41] software according to the force field parameterizations reported in Table S2 (Electronic Supplementary Information). MD simulations for GLY + {2BUT, 23BD, 2M1P or BA} mixtures were carried out in the full composition range using the systems reported in Table S3 (Electronic Supplementary Information). MD simulations were carried out for the whole composition range using 500 total molecules. Packmol [42] program was used for building initial simulation boxes, with box sizes as inferred from densities as per experimental data. Simulations in the NPT ensemble at 293 K and 0.1 MPa (Nose–Hoover method) were carried out. MD simulations for each system starts with an equilibration step followed by 10 ns production run. Equations of motion were solved with Tuckerman–Berne double time step algorithm [43] (1 and 0.1 f. for long and short time steps). Electrostatic interactions were treated with the Ewald method [44] (15 Å for cut-off radius) and Lennard-Jones interactions (15 Å cut-off) were used with Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules. The analysis of MD trajectories was carried out using TRAVIS software [45]."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Thermophysical study,"3.1 Thermophysical study The experimental densities and speeds of sound of pure studied liquid alcohols and their corresponding literature ones are compiled in Table S1 (Supplementary information) and the values for the four binary mixtures, over the entire composition range at five different temperatures are reported in Tables S4–S7 and plotted in Figs. S1–S5 (Supplementary information). All the properties in this work are reported as a function of GLY mole fraction (x). Redlich – Kister coefficients for excess properties are reported in Table S8 (Supplementary information). Results for VE reported in Fig. 2 show negative values for the three binary systems GLY + 2BUT, 23BD and 2M1P, over the entire composition range at all temperatures (Figs. S1–S3). In the case of GLY + BA, S-shaped curves are inferred, evolving from positive to negative values at around x1 = 0.3 to 0.4, Fig. 2 andS4 (Supplementary information). Regarding the position of the VE minima, i.e. mixture composition leading to the most efficient molecular packing, for 2BUT mixture the minima occur at x = 0.6032 (x stands for GLY mole fraction) while for 2M1P and 23BD the minima appear at x = 0.5042 and 0.5034, respectively. For BA mixtures, the S-shaped behavior of VE leads to a maximum at x = 0.1043 and a minimum that occurs between x = 0.7059 and 0.8039 (temperature dependence in Fig. S4, Supplementary information). The VE behavior for BA containing mixtures is justified considering steric effects because of the very different size and shape of GLY and BA molecules. For BA rich mixtures expansion upon mixing is justified by the trend of BA molecules to self-aggregate and the hindrance induced by the presence of planar aromatic rings, which are disrupted by the presence of GLY molecules. For GLY, rich mixtures the shape of GLY molecules allows packing of BA molecules leading to contraction upon mixing. The negative sign of VE for mixtures of GLY with non-aromatic alcohols (2-BUT, 23BD and 2M1P) indicates a decrease in the overall volume of the mixture with respect to the pure ones, where the contraction of the volume can be attributed to strong interactions (mainly due to H-bonding) between unlike molecules. For 23BD mixtures, lower VE values are inferred (in absolute value) in comparison with 2BUT and 2M1P, which may be justified considering that the strong self-association of 23BD by the presence of two hydroxyl groups (as may be inferred from the larger viscosities of 23BD in comparison with 2BUT or 2M1P, Table S1, Supplementary information) is disrupted by the presence of competing hydroxyl groups in GLY upon mixing. Likewise, the inspection of Fig. S1 to S3 indicates that as the temperature increases from 298.15 K up to 318.15 K, the values of VE increase in absolute value (i.e. larger contraction upon mixing) for 2BUT, 23BD and 2M1P, whereas for the binary mixture with BA the opposite behavior is inferred leading to less efficient packing upon heating in the whole composition range. The k S E values for the selected binary mixtures are plotted in Fig. 2 and Figs. S1–S4 (Supplementary information) showing negative values for all the considered mixtures, increasing in absolute value upon heating. Therefore, all the mixtures are less compressible than the pure components, i.e. enhanced rigidity upon mixing by the presence of strong heteroassociation by hydrogen bonding. The systems with 2BUT, 23BD and 2M1P show both enhanced rigidity ( κ s E <0) and contraction (VE < 0) over the entire composition range. In other words, the volume decreases (more compact packing of molecules), and simultaneously the whole system becomes more rigid (less compressible). In the case of GLY + BA , κ s E values are roughly an order of magnitude lower than for the other mixtures, even being positive over the entire composition range at some studied temperatures. The behavior of α P E is reported in Fig. 2 and Tables S4–S7 (Supplementary information) showing negative values over the whole composition range for 2BUT, 23BD and 2M1P and positive ones for BA mixtures. This pattern confirms the very different nature of hydrogen bonding in BA mixtures, because of the disrupting effect of aromatic ring and the trend of packing by the presence of this molecular feature. The large trend of non-aromatic alcohols to develop heteroassociations by hydrogen bonding justify α P E negative values, with larger compressibility for 23BD by the presence of two hydrogen bonding sites and the property evolution upon mixing in comparison with neat 23BD. The partial molar volumes and derived properties are reported in Table 1 . In the case of GLY at infinite dilution, V ‾ 1 E , ∞ , in 2BUT, 23BD and 2M1P, and for these alcohols infinitely diluted in GLY, V ‾ 2 E , ∞ , negative values are inferred for both cases, thus showing the ability of both mixture components to efficiently pack into the other component hydrogen bonding network. In the case of BA mixtures, positive values for V ‾ 1 E , ∞ and negative values for V ‾ 2 E , ∞ are inferred, in agreement with S-shaped VE , which confirm that GLY molecules are poorly fitted into BA hydrogen bonding network whereas BA can fit properly into GLY network, thus confirming the driving force of aromatic rings to develop local arrangements hindering efficient packing of branched GLY molecules. Therefore, the large negative V ‾ 1 E , ∞ and V ‾ 2 E , ∞ values for 2BUT, 23BD and 2M1P suggest the presence of significant interactions (hydrogen bonding) between GLY and these molecules."
6,Molecular modelling,"3.2 Molecular modelling In a first stage of the theoretical study of the considered mixtures, intermolecular forces were analyzed by DFT study of 1:1 clusters. The involved molecules in the considered mixtures, GLY + {2BUT or 23BD or 2M1P or BA}, may act both as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors because of the presence of hydroxyl groups in all the compounds. To study the characteristics of hydrogen bonding in the studied liquid mixtures, 1:1 clusters for homoassociations (Fig. S6, Supplementary information) and heteroassociations (Fig. S7, Supplementary information) were optimized. All the possible hydrogen bonds involve hydroxyl – hydroxyl interactions, with the presence of three hydroxyl groups in GLY leading to several types of hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonds were also characterized by using AIM theory through the calculation of electron density, ρ, and the corresponding Laplacian, ∇ 2 ρ , for binary critical points (BCPs, type (3,-1) according to Bader's [39]). All the relevant properties are reported in Table 2 . In the case of GLY-GLY homoassociations, Fig. S6 (Supplementary information), three main different types of hydrogen bonding schemes were found involving primary and secondary hydroxyl groups. The first type of hydrogen bonding, GLY_GLY_01, lead to two hydrogen bonds formed by two different sites in each molecule, whereas the second type, GLY_GLY_02, involves a hydroxyl group acting both as donor and acceptor thus forming two hydrogen bonds, and leading to larger binding energy in comparison with GLY_GLY_01. In the third case, GLY_GLY_03, three hydrogen bonds are formed by a group acting both as donor and acceptor and the neighbor group developing an additional hydrogen bond, thus leading to the larger binding energy, Table 2. For all the considered GLY_GLY interactions, donor – acceptor (O to H) distances are in the 1.8 to 1.9 Å range, which combined with the large binding energies show strong hydrogen bonding. The topological analysis using AIM method shows the formation of BCPs for all the considered hydrogen bonding sites of GLY-GLY interactions. Popelier [46] proposed criteria to evaluate hydrogen bonding according to AIM theory showing that ρ should be in the 0.002 to 0.035 a.u. range and ∇ 2 ρ in the 0.024 to 0.139 a.u. range, with larger values showing stronger hydrogen bonds. Values of ρ and ∇ 2 ρ reported in Table 2 for GLY-GLY interactions are close to the upper limit of Popelier's ranges, thus confirming very strong and efficient hydrogen bonds for all the considered interaction mechanisms, Fig. S6 (Supplementary information). In the case of cosolvent (COS, where COS = {2BUT or 23BD or 2M1P or BA}) – cosolvent interactions, all these molecules, except 23BD, have a single hydroxyl group, and thus a single type of hydrogen bond can be developed, Fig. S6 (Supplementary information). In the case of 23BD, although two hydroxyl groups are present in the molecule, both are equivalent. Binding energies reported in Table 2, are lower than those for GLY-GLY because a single hydrogen bond is formed, but they show strong hydrogen bonds in agreement with the reported donor-acceptor distances and AIM properties close to the upper limit of ranges, thus showing that each hydrogen bond corresponding to GLY-GLY or COS–COS interactions have similar properties in terms of strength and topological properties. For GLY – COS hydrogen bonding, four interaction mechanisms were considered (those with the largest binding energies, Fig. S7, Supplementary information). GLY-COS interactions are characterized in most of the cases by a stronger hydrogen bond (shorter donor-acceptor distances) accompanied by a second weaker interaction. The strength of GLY-COS hydrogen bondings are dependent on the considered COS following the ordering 2BUT <23BD < 2 MP1P ~ BA. Results in Table 2 show that binding energies are in the range COS–COS < GLY-COS < GLY-GLY. Nevertheless, the combination of binding energies, donor-acceptor distances and AIM analysis for GLY-COS interactions show that strong hydrogen bonding is produced. Therefore, GLY-COS liquid mixtures should be characterized by the competing effect of GLY-GLY, COS–COS and GLY-COS hydrogen bonding, it may be expected that weaker COS–COS interactions would leads to a disruption of this type of interactions for developing strong GLY-COS ones with increasing GLY content, thus increasing heteroassociations extension by decreasing homoassociation. The analysis of bulk liquid phases for GLY – COS mixtures was developed from MD simulations as a function of mixture composition at isothermal (298.15 K) and isobaric (0.1 MPa) conditions. In a first stage, predicted thermophysical properties were compared with experimental results reported in previous sections. The results reported in Fig. 3 a for density show a reasonable agreement between experimental and MD predicted density in the whole composition range for the four GLY + COS considered systems. The main deviations are obtained for GLY – rich mixtures but the composition evolution is well predicted by the considered MD. It should be remarked that the force field parameterization applied in this work (Table S2, Supplementary information) considers transferable parameters for all the types of atoms, i.e. the same parameters were used for all the considered compounds, which although allows the study of the considered mixtures under the same model, may lead to deviations in compounds with large number of hydroxyl groups as GLY. The prediction of excess molar volume is a difficult task from MD simulations, because it depends on a subtle combination of geometric and intermolecular forces factors, but results reported in Fig. 3b show that the reported MD are able to predict qualitatively the evolution of excess volume for the considered COS and also a reasonable quantitative agreement is inferred with the exception of GLY + BA mixtures for which the complex experimental sigmoidal shape is not properly reproduced. Therefore, results in Fig. 3 show a reasonable ability of MD for predicting thermophysical properties of GLY + COS mixtures, and thus, capturing the most relevant features of these systems. The analysis of GLY + COS mixtures structuring was firstly carried out by site-site radial distribution functions involving atomic pairs which are able to develop hydrogen bonding, considering GLY-COS, GLY-GLY and COS–COS interactions, Fig. 4 . The reported results show that all the considered hydroxyl sites are able to develop homo and heteroassociations in the whole composition range (Figs. S8–S11, Supplementary information). The RDFs are equivalent for all the considered sites with a first intense narrow peak at 1.9 Å (for oxygen to hydrogen acceptor – donor distance), which agrees with DFT results in Table 2, followed aby a second less intense and wider peak at 3.4 Å. Therefore, GLY-GLY, COS–COS and GLY-COS hydrogen bonding are present in the studied mixtures in the whole composition range. Regarding GLY-COS interactions (Fig. 4a–f), although the structure of RDFs peaks is the same for all the considered COs, less intense peaks are inferred for 23BD and BA containing mixtures, although the differences decrease with increasing GLY content. For GLY-GLY interactions, results in Fig. 4g to l shows that hydrogen bonding is developed both through primary and secondary hydroxyl groups of GLY molecules. In the case of COS–COS interactions, RDFs more less intense for 23BD and BA are also inferred, thus pointing to a larger trend of 23BD/BA molecules to develop heteroassociations with GLY in comparison with 2BUT and 2M1P. Regarding the spatial arrangement of hydroxyl groups, spatial distribution functions reported in Fig. 5 around a central GLY molecule show that all the available hydroxyl groups, O1 (primary) and O2 (secondary) in GLY and Oco in COS occupy the same spatial regions around the hydrogen bonding sites in GLY, thus competing for the same interaction sites, which combined with RDFs reported in Fig. 4 show that homo and heteroassociations are present in the studied binary mixtures. To confirm that the developed interactions are truly hydrogen bonds, combined distribution functions (CDFs) including hydrogen – oxygen distance (corresponding to RDFs in Fig. 4) and the corresponding angle distribution function for the donor-acceptor sites are reported in Fig. 6 . The reported CDFs confirm the development of hydrogen bonds, with maxima for ADFs at 170° combined with the O to H separation of 1.9 Å. This behavior is inferred for all the considered COS, thus confirming the nature of hydrogen bonding for all the GLY – COS interactions. The evolution of intermolecular interaction energy, E int , with mixtures composition is reported in Fig. 7 for homo and heteroassociations. The composition effect on all the considered interactions (GLY-GLY, COS–COS and GLY-COS) follows a non-linear evolution. In the case of GLY-GLY, Fig. 7a, the large trend of GLY molecules to self-associate is confirmed by the minor differences inferred considering the type of involved COS. For COS–COS interactions, Fig. 7b, large E int value are inferred for COS – rich mixtures but decreasing with increasing GLY content. In the case of GLY – COS heteroassociations, Fig. 7c, a non-linear evolution is inferred with minima at roughly equimolar compositions, with the larger stronger interactions (in absolute value) obtained for 23BD. 23BD also leads to larger COS–COS E int , Fig. 7b. The ratios of the different E int with regard to GLY-GLY interactions are reported in Fig. 8 , showing that for mixture compositions larger than 0.4 for GLY mole fraction, the GLY-GLY E int terms are larger than GLY-COS and COS–COS, thus showing the prevailing role of GLY to self-associate. For low GLY mole fraction, mole fraction lower than 0.4, the COS–COS interactions prevail. Additionally, GLY-COS E int although being lower than the other two contributions, it is present in the whole composition range thus showing that GLY molecules develop self-hydrogen bonding, they are also able to interact with COS molecules. The extension of hydrogen bonding is analyzed by the number of hydrogen bonds per molecule, N H-bonds , as reported in Fig. 9 . Results for GLY-GLY hydrogen bonding, Fig. 9a–c, show that GLY molecules are hydrogen bonded mainly through O1–O1 and O1–O2 interactions, whereas O2–O2 hydrogen bonds are scarcer. The large trend of GLY molecules to be self-hydrogen bonded is manifested considering that even at highly diluted solutions (x = 0.1) roughly 50% of GLY molecules develop GLY-GLY hydrogen bonds. In the case of COS-COS interactions, Fig. 9d, the large trend of 2BUT molecules to self-hydrogen bonding is remarked over BA, which show lower extension of hydrogen bonding. The GLY-COS heteroassociations are mainly developed through GLY(O1) site, Fig. 9e, and in minor extension through the secondary GLY hydroxyl site, Fig. 9e. Nevertheless, the trend of COS to develop hydrogen bonding, especially for 23BD, is confirmed in the whole composition range, although decreasing with increasing GLY content by the large trend of GLY molecules to be self-associated. The dynamics of hydrogen bonding is calculated by the so-called residence times, t res , which calculate the time a certain atom remains inside a sphere of a certain radius around another central atom. The sphere radii were defined according to the first minima in the corresponding RDFs, Figs. S8–S11 (Supplementary information). All the calculated t res are in the 20–60 ps range, thus confirming the lability of the developed hydrogen bonds in spite of the large interaction energies reported in Fig. 7. The composition effect on t res is almost negligible for all the considered interactions. Regarding GLY-GLY interactions, t res are the same independently of the considered hydrogen bonding site in GLY and with very minor effects of the considered COS, especially for GLY – rich mixtures, Fig. 10 a–c. In the case of COS–COS interactions, t res are largely dependent on the type of COS with lower values for BA and larger ones for 2BUT, Fig. 10d. For GLY-COS, Fig. 10e and f, t res are equivalent for O1 and O2 sites in GLY, with larger t res for 2BUT. Therefore, t res results show that 2BUT leads to the less labile hydrogen bonds for all the considered types, whereas BA forms the most labile hydrogen bonds, which may be justified considering the steric effects by the presence of the bulky phenyl group, which hinders hydrogen bonding through hydroxyl groups in BA molecules. The similar t res for all the considered interactions points to a pivotal role of GLY molecules for the structuring of the considered mixtures by hydrogen bonding because of its large trend to self-associate."
7,Conclusions,"This article reported the densities and speeds of sound of the mixtures of glycerol with the pure alcohols 2-butanol, isobutanol, 2, 3-butanediol, and benzyl alcohol, from 298.15K to 318.15K at 5K intervals, at atmospheric pressure, and over the entire range of mole fractions using a vibrating tube densimeter. As has been outlined earlier, all the systems under study showed non-ideal behavior. This non-ideality can be explained by two factors: intermolecular forces in the mixture and enhanced rigidity. The main source of intermolecular interactions comes from hydrogen bonding between the components and also interaction between electrons of benzene ring and proton of alkanols. Regarding the theoretical study, DFT and MD results have confirmed the development of hydrogen bonding and its role in mixed fluids properties. GLY molecules have a large trend to self-associate, which is accompanied by the development of hydrogen bonds with the cosolvent in the whole composition range, but with GLY-GLY interactions prevailing over most of the studied mixtures. In spite of the ability of cosolvent molecules to develop self-hydrogen bonding, only at low GLY content cosolvent molecules are largely self-associated, thus developing hydrogen bonds with GLY molecules."
