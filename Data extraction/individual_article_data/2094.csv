0,Introduction,"Methanogenic fermentation has been applied in digestion of manure, plant biomass, sewage sludge and organic fraction of municipal solid wastes in both industrial countries and in agrarian societies to stabilize wastes and wastewater sludges, to treat wastewaters and to produce bioenergy [1]. Hydrogen production, on the other hand, is still in the research and development phase [2]. Studies on hydrogen production by dark fermentation have mainly focused on using simple substrates such as synthetic wastewaters containing single model substrate like glucose or sucrose [3]. However, hydrogen production from biopolymers consisting of glucose monomers such as cellulose and starch [3] as well as with plant and waste materials such as cornstalk [4], potato starch residue [5] and carbohydrate-rich, fat-rich and protein-rich solid organic wastes [6] has also been reported. The complexity of lignocellulosic material in plants forms a protective barrier against plant cell degradation by micro-organisms. Available sites for enzymatic attack are limited and confined to the external surface of the plant material, because the average size of the capillaries in plant biomass is not large enough to allow the entry of large enzymes [7]. According to [8] efficient utilization of lignocellulosic material in fermentation processes requires that cellulose and hemicellulose must be broken down to their corresponding monomers. This can be done with several different methods, including mechanical pretreatment such as chipping, shredding, grinding, milling, extrusion and combinations of these [8,9] or physicochemical pretreatments such as hot liquid water treatment [10], steam explosion [11], ammonia fiber explosion [12] and carbon dioxide explosion [13]. Also chemical methods such as acid hydrolysis [14], alkaline hydrolysis [7], hydrogen peroxide [15] and organosolv process [16], as well as biological pretreatment [17] and enzymatic pretreatment [18] have been used. In all of these methods the goal is to break the lignin seal and disrupt the crystalline structure of cellulose, increase the porosity of lignocellulose and increase the surface area of the material [7,9]. The aim of this study was to investigate the hydrogen and methane production potential from reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) (RCG). RCG is a high-yielding perennial grass that naturally grows almost everywhere in the Northern hemisphere and is conventionally utilized in Finland as mixed fuel in combustion with peat or wood [19]. RCG fermentation was studied in batch bottles in solid and in soluble acid hydrolyzed form."
1,Materials and methods,
2,RCG and its acid hydrolysis,"2.1 RCG and its acid hydrolysis The RCG was cultivated in Sotkamo, Finland (64° 8′ 0′′ North, 28° 25′ 0′′ East) on peat bogs, where peat recovery for energy pellet production had been completed. The RCG was spring harvested by mowing two years after seeding and one year preceding the experimental period. No drying was required and the grass was chopped to under 7 cm pieces resulting in size distribution from small powder to 7 cm grass fragments. In Finnish climate conditions, RCG grown for 2–4 years and harvested in spring has typical chemical composition of 44–47% cellulose, 25–28% hemicelluloses, 9–10% lignin and 5–12% ash [20]. Acid hydrolysis was conducted at 10% (w/v) solids loading with 3% HCl solution for 90 min at 121 °C in an autoclave. After autoclaving, the resulting solution with soluble sugars (hydrolysate) was decanted and the solid portion discarded."
3,Inocula and experimental conditions,"2.2 Inocula and experimental conditions Hydrogen production was tested using two inocula: H2-fermenting microbial enrichment culture and fresh inoculum from an anaerobic digester operating at 35 °C and treating mixture of primary and secondary sludge from a municipal activated sludge process in Viinikanlahti wastewater treatment plant (Tampere, Finland, 61° 30′ 0′′ North, 23° 45′ 0′′ East). The H2-producing enrichment culture was enriched earlier from the anaerobic digester sludge as described by Koskinen et al. [21] and suppression of methanogenesis in the fresh anaerobic digester sludge was done by heat treatment at 80 °C for 2 h or with 20 mM 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (BESA). CH4-fermentation was studied with the untreated anaerobic digester sludge and without BESA. Production potential from synthetic cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) HCl-hydrolysate was tested with two batch assays at 35 °C in 120 mL anaerobic serum bottles with 50 mL of medium and 2% (v/v) inoculum. The first assay was done with modified Endo medium [22] and the second with modified Zehnder medium [23] with modifications by Karlsson et al. [24] and Ejlertsson et al. [25]. After the inoculation the bottles were incubated at 35 °C for 77 days in the modified Endo medium assay and for 42 days in the modified Zehnder medium assay. Hydrogen and methane production potential from solid untreated RCG and soluble RCG hydrolysate were tested in anaerobic 600 mL serum bottles with 250 mL modified Zehnder media and 2% (v/v) inoculum. After inoculation the bottles were incubated at 35 °C for 203 days. The batch bottles included in these assays were as given in Tables 1 and 2 ."
4,Sampling and analytical methods,"2.3 Sampling and analytical methods During the synthetic cellulose assays and the RCG assay the growth of the bacteria was monitored by taking gas phase samples for the analysis of gas production and composition, and liquid samples for the analysis of organic acids and alcohols. During the RCG assay also liquid pH and chemical oxygen demand of soluble compounds (CODs) were analyzed. Because the pH of the positive controls containing both RCG hydrosylate and glucose as the substrate had decreased to 3.9–4.3 on day 23, NaHCO3 buffer was added to the positive controls to raise the pH to approximately 6. Gas production, gas phase composition and the concentration of organic acids and alcohols (ethanol, butanol, acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate and caproate) were analyzed as described by Koskinen et al. [21]. The pH was measured with WTW pH 33,301 pH-meter and with Hamilton Slimtrode electrode. CODs were analyzed from filtrated samples (0.45 μm) using dichromate method according to standard SFS 5504 [26]. The soluble sugars concentrations of the hydrolysates before and after filtration through 0.45 μm polyethersulphone syringe filter were analyzed with anthrone-method by Hansen and Møller [27] and Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer."
5,Results,
6,Acid hydrolysis,"3.1 Acid hydrolysis Autoclaving of synthetic cellulose and chopped RCG for 90 min at 121 °C in 3 % HCl resulted in release of 61.7 mg g−1 (dw) and 115 mg g−1 (dw) of reducing sugars, respectively."
7,Gas production from synthetic cellulose,"3.2 Gas production from synthetic cellulose With Endo media, gas production from the synthetic cellulose hydrolysate was low, and the variations between replicate bottles were high (Table 3 ). Hydrogen yields from cellulose hydrolysate with modified Zehnder media and sludge amended with BESA were significantly higher than with Endo media with the same inocula (Table 3). Also gas production lag phases were shorter and hydrogen production rates higher with Zehnder media than with Endo media (results not shown). Therefore, modified Zehnder medium was chosen for the culture medium to be used in the RCG assay. Hydrogen yield per added soluble sugars was higher from cellulose hydrolysate than from glucose under similar conditions (Table 3). This was likely due to degradation products of glucose resulting from the acid treatment of cellulose. These compounds were not included in the concentration of soluble sugars, but may have been utilized by the micro-organisms resulting in higher gas yield. The results of the cellulose hydrolysate assays indicated that cellulose hydrolysate could readily be used as carbon source for hydrogen and methane fermentation."
8,Gas production from RCG,"3.3 Gas production from RCG Hydrogen and methane production potential from RCG was tested with both RCG hydrolysate and solid RCG to determine whether pretreatment would improve the gas yields. Hydrogen and methane production volumes per bottle were considerably higher with RCG hydrolysate than with solid RCG as the substrate (Fig. 1 , Table 4 ). With both substrates, hydrogen production was highest with H2 enrichment culture and lowest with untreated sludge (Fig. 1A and B, Table 4). Significant methane production was achieved only with untreated sludge. As expected, methanogenesis was low with H2 enrichment culture and with sludge amended with BESA (Fig. 1C and D, Table 4). Hydrogen and methane production in negative controls with no substrate was insignificant compared to gas production levels in the RCG hydrolysate cultures. However, when compared with solid RCG bottles, the gas production levels of negative controls were only approximately half of those from solid RCG (Table 4). No clear exponential growth phase was observed from methane production curve with solid RCG (Fig. 1D) indicating that solid RCG was recalcitrant for methanogenesis. Gas production rates were highest with the RCG hydrolysate and in positive controls with RGC hydrolysate and glucose. With both the RCG hydrolysate and the solid RCG hydrogen production rate was generally highest with the H2 enrichment culture. Lag phases in gas production were relatively long with the RCG hydrolysate and the variations between the lag times of replicate bottles were also significant (Table 4). Lag phases were extremely long in the positive control bottles, because the pH decreased to 3.9–4.3 in the beginning of the experiment. This was presumably due to high organic load resulting in excessive fatty acid production. Even though the solution pH was raised near to 6 on day 26, the cultures did not fully recover from the pH stress and gas production remained low. In the other batch bottles pH remained above 5.4 over the whole assay (Fig. 2 A). With RCG hydrolysate and untreated sludge, with high CH4 production, the pH increased significantly in the latter part of the assay due to alkalinity production from methanogenesis. The main degradation products from the RCG hydrolysate were acetate, propionate and butyrate (Fig. 2). Also ethanol, butanol, isobutyrate, valerate and caproate were formed in some of the bottles, but their concentrations were lower. Organic acids accumulated in the bottles where hydrogen production occurred, but no methane was produced (Fig. 2B, C and D). With untreated sludge, fatty acids accumulated in the beginning together with hydrogen production, while fatty acids were reduced in the latter part of the assay to methane (Fig. 2B, C and D). Hydrogen and methane yields were calculated per added soluble sugars for the RCG hydrolysate bottles, and per initial CODs and removed CODs for all of the bottles (Table 5 ). In all cases, hydrogen yields were highest with RCG hydrolysate and H2 enrichment. Methane yield per added soluble sugars was highest with RCG hydrolysate and untreated sludge. However, methane yields per initial and removed CODs were higher with solid RCG than with RCG hydrolysate (Table 5)."
9,Discussion,"This work demonstrated hydrogen and methane production from RCG. Methane was produced with both solid RCG and RCG hydrolysate, while hydrogen production remained at very low level with solid RCG (Table 6 )."
10,Acid hydrolysis,"4.1 Acid hydrolysis During the acid hydrolysis of the RCG, 11.5 weight percent of the dry material was solubilised to soluble sugars, as the highest yield with 3% HCl at 121 °C from RCG was 115 mg g−1 (dw) soluble sugars. This was rather low compared to extraction of over 300 mg g−1 reducing sugars from rye straw and almost 400 mg g−1 soluble sugars from bermuda grass with 1.5% H2SO4 under similar hydrolysis conditions [14]. The RCG used in this study was stored for one year before the start of the experimental period, which may have influenced the sugar yields."
11,Lag times and gas production rates,"4.2 Lag times and gas production rates Hydrogen and methane production lag times were generally longer with RCG hydrolysate than with solid RCG. Lag times for hydrogen production were 16–76 h and less than 24 h, and for methane production 540 h and less than 24 h with RCG hydrolysate and solid RCG, respectively. The significant difference in the methane production lag times from RCG hydrolysate and solid RCG may be due to slow adaptation of the methanogens to possible inhibitory products of the acid hydrolysis [28] and/or the low initial pH of the RCG hydrolysate medium (Fig. 2A). The lag phases in H2 and CH4 production were in the similar range or longer to those observed in other studies, e. g. 19–27 h lag time in H2 production from glucose, sucrose and molasses and 40 h from potato starch [29], and 14–48 h lag time in CH4 production from lipid rich waste [30]. Hydrogen and methane production rates, on the other hand, were low, 0.63–1.3 mL h−1 and 0.71 mL h−1 from RCG hydrolysate and 0–0.01 mL h−1 and 0.09 mL h−1 from solid RCG, respectively. Production rates ranging from 10 mL h−1 biogas [29] and 40–137 mL h−1 H2 [31] from glucose, 7.6 mL h−1 H2 from cornstalk [3] and 4.2–6.3 mL h−1 CH4 from municipal solid waste (MSW) [32] have been reported. There are several possible reasons why lag times and gas production rates observed in the present study differ from those reported in the literature. 1) The conditions used in acid hydrolysis may have caused gradual degradation of lignocellulosic material into formic and levulunic acid, which are toxic to fermenting micro-organisms [28]. 2) Solid RCG is bulky and its complexity formed a protective barrier against plant cell destruction caused by micro-organisms. 3) The biogas was released from the bottles only once a day or less frequently during the assays and thus, the high pressure caused by gas production in the bottles may have suppressed hydrogen production as suggested by Logan et al. [29]. 4) In addition, inocula of this study were not enriched with RCG hydrolysate or solid RCG prior to the conducted experiments."
12,Gas yields,"4.3 Gas yields Theoretically glucose fermentation to acetic acid yields 4 mol-H2 mol-glucose−1 and with butyrate production the theoretical maximum yield is 2 mol-H2 mol-glucose−1 [33]. (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 Yokoi et al. [4] reported 2.4 mol-H2 mol-glucose−1 with potato starch residue and Morimoto et al. [31] 2.1 mol-H2 mol-glucose−1 with glucose. The highest hydrogen yield of this study (Table 6) was near to the theoretical and in agreement with results reported in the literature. However, it should be taken into account that the measured soluble sugars were not only glucose, as was assumed in the calculations, because the sugars in the hydrolysate were not characterized in study. According to Dien et al. [34] cell wall carbohydrate composition of RCG on dry weight basis is 265 mg g−1 glucose, 163 mg g−1 xylose, 28 mg g−1 arabinose, 13 mg g−1 galactose, 6 mg g−1 mannose, 1 mg g−1 rhamnose, 1 mg g−1 fucose and 21 mg g−1uronic acids. Glucose molecule contains six carbon and methane one carbon atom. Therefore, the theoretical maximum is 6 mol-CH4 mol-glucose−1. Nevertheless, the highest achieved methane yield was 6.2 mol–CH4 mol-glucose−1. This likely indicates that in addition to soluble sugars, the RCG hydrolysate contained also other compounds that methanogens utilized effectively. Based on gas production volumes, RCG hydrolysation improved both hydrogen and methane production (Fig. 1, Table 6). The hydrogen production (mmol/L) with RCG hydrolysate was 41 times higher than with solid RCG, while the corresponding value for methane was 1.6. The gas production per gram of used RCG, showed that hydrogen production was enhanced by hydrolysation, which was also the case in hydrogen sulfide production from the same material [35]. Methane production was, however, higher from solid RCG than from RCG hydrolysate (Table 6). Gas yields per added and removed CODs were generally higher from solid RCG than from RCG hydrolysate (Table 6). However, solid RCG was solubilised during the assay and this soluble material was utilized by the micro-organisms. Methane yield from RGC hydrolysate in terms of added COD (10.1) was in agreement with values by Fuchs et al. [36], reporting 7.2–12.6, 8.4–14.3 and 5.05–13.5 mmol CH4 per g added COD from artificial wastewater, vegetable processing wastewater and from chicken slaughter house wastewater, respectively. Nopharatana et al. [32] reported 11.8 mmol CH4 per g fed COD from soluble fraction of MSW. Hydrogen yields per added COD were not found in the reviewed literature and therefore could not be compared. Because of the relatively high lignin content of RCG, Martínez-Pérez et al. [37] assumed that fermentation of RCG to hydrogen and methane without pretreatment would be problematic and calculated that energy output from H2 would be 0 MJ ha−1 and from CH4 38 250 MJ ha−1. Highest hydrogen and methane yields obtained in this study were 1.25 mmol H2 and 8.26 mmol CH4 per g (dw) used RCG, respectively. Assuming that dry matter yield of RCG is 6–8 tons ha−1 in Finnish climate conditions and overall harvesting losses are approximately 30% [19] and using the lower heating values from Martínez-Pérez et al. [37] based on production yields from this study, the energy output would be 1360–1820 MJ ha−1 from H2 and 29 530–39 370 MJ ha−1 from CH4, respectively. Effective calorific value of spring harvested RCG is 14.6 MJ kg−1 [38] and energy output via direct combustion would be 61 320–81 760 MJ ha−1. Thus, energy output via direct combustion would be higher than that via biogenic hydrogen or methane production, but hydrogen and methane have additional benefits such as possibility to utilize them as a transport fuel and enablement to recycle the nutrients of the feed-stock if the residual biosolids from anaerobic fermentation are utilized as biofertilizer."
13,Conclusions,"This study demonstrated that hydrogen and methane could be produced biologically from RCG. Acid hydrolysis of the RCG was required for hydrogen, but not for methane production. The hydrogen and methane yields were 1.25 mmol H2 and 8.26 mmol CH4 per g (dw) RCG, while the production rates with RCG hydrolysate and solid RCG were 0.01–1.3 mL h−1 and 0.09–0.71 mL h−1, respectively. The hydrolysis should be improved to increase hydrogen production from RCG, and acclimation of the microbial consortia to the used substrates could enhance both hydrogen and methane production."
