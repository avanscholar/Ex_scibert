0,Introduction,"Recently, many studies have been conducted to develop biopolymers made from agricultural commodities and/or food waste products to obtain new food packaging materials. These bio-based materials can be degraded by bacteria, yeast, or fungi [1]. The interest in biopolymers has increased due to the depletion of the fossil fuel reserve and the environmental impact caused by the accumulation of plastic-based packaging materials. Synthetic polymers are available in large quantities at low cost, and possess good properties such as heat sealability, tensile, tear strength, barrier to gas and aroma compounds. However, these synthetic plastics are no-biodegradable, leading to serious environment problems by accumulation. Research efforts have focused on the development of biodegradable films and coatings as a potential solution to reduce environmental problems associated with food packaging. In addition, it is necessary to study the mechanical and permeability properties to assess their performance as food packaging material [2,3]. Mechanical properties of films are important to determine if they could have an adequate mechanical strength and integrity during transportation, handling and storage of packaged foods [4]. Barrier properties of a polymeric film play a key role in maintaining food product quality. Moisture may transfer through the polymer package, resulting in product quality change that decreases shelf-life [5]. The raw material used to develop biopolymeric films must proceed from renewable sources such as proteins, lipids, polysaccharides and all possible combinations among them. Among the polysaccharides used to develop biodegradable films, cellulose and chitosan are the most abundant biopolymers on earth. As raw material to elaborate films, chitosan and cellulose are readily available, ease to modify and with several potential applications [3]. Cellulose represents yearly about 1.5·1015 kg of the total biomass production. It is considered an almost inexhaustible source of raw material for the increasing demand for environmentally friendly and biocompatible products. Wood pulp is still the most important raw material source for the processing of cellulose. Approximately, 2% of cellulose is used for production of regenerated cellulose fibers and films, as well as for the synthesis of a large number of cellulose esters and ethers [6]. Cellulose is a linear chain with two anhydroglucose rings ((C6H10O5)n), covalently linked through an oxygen in a β-1-4 glycosidic bond. The number of repeated units per chain depends on the source [7]. Cellulose applications can be roughly classified into three aspects: direct use, degradation into small molecules and chemical modifications. Direct use without any chemical derivation has received considerable attention recently, although cellulose is not soluble in usual solvents, due to its structure [8]. Some solvent systems for cellulose dissolution have been developed, including N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, ionic liquids, LiCl/N,N-dimethylacetamide, NaOH aqueous solution, NaOH/urea or NaOH/thiourea aqueous solution [9,10]. Cellulose-based films possess some drawbacks including poor mechanical and barrier properties [11]. A feasible strategy to improve the film properties is the combination of cellulose with other biopolymers. Chitosan, poly(β-(1–4)-2-acetamido-d-glucose), is structurally identical to cellulose, except that a secondary hydroxyl on the second carbon atom of the hexose repeated unit is replaced by an acetamide group. Cellulose and chitosan show some different properties and behaviors. For example, chitosan is soluble in acid conditions and chitosan films have a selective permeability to gasses (CO2 and O2) and good mechanical properties [12]. However, the high permeability to water vapour of chitosan films limits their use since an effective control of moisture transfer is a desirable property for most foods, especially in moist environments. Therefore, strategies have been followed to improve the physical properties of chitosan-based films [13,14]. Other polymer that could be combined with cellulose and chitosan is polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a semi-crystalline polymer extensively studied [15]. It is biodegradable, soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol, but insoluble in other organic solvents. PVA is suitable to combine with other polymer to improve the physical, thermal and barrier properties due to its high polar character, good mechanical properties and easy processability [16,17]. Usually, a combination of materials allows obtaining better mechanical and barrier properties than those of pure polymers. Thus, combining chitosan and PVA with cellulose could produce composite films with novel properties. Studies on cellulose films combined with chitosan or PVA has been published but the combination of both together with cellulose has not been published yet. Many studies on combined cellulose and chitosan have been focused in chitosan films reinforced with microfibrillated, nanofibrillated cellulose or cellulose fiber [16,18–20], cellulose nanowhiskers, nanocrystalline cellulose [21–25] or cellulose particles added directly to a chitosan dissolution [26]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop biodegradable copolymer films based on cellulose, chitosan and PVA. Polynomial models were obtained to evaluate the effect of the composition of the blend on mechanical properties (tensile strength, percentage of elongation at break, Young's modulus) and water vapour permeability (WVP)."
1,Materials and methods,"Microcrystalline cellulose, extra pure (average particle size 90 μm), urea (99.5%) for analysis, sodium hydroxide (98%), sodium bromide (99%) extra pure anhydrous and acetic acid (99.5%) were purchased from Acros organics (Geel, Belgium). Polyvinyl alcohol, degree of hydrolysis (calculated on dried substance) ≥98% and molecular weight (MW) approx. 30000, was obtained from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Chitosan (Mw 100000–300000) was purchased from Acros organics (Geel, Belgium)."
2,Preparation of films,"2.1 Preparation of films The NaOH/urea method was used for dissolving cellulose. Films were elaborated according to a modified method [27]. Briefly, the aqueous solution containing NaOH/urea/H2O at 7:14:79 (w/w) ratio was used as solvent. The desired amount of cellulose was dispersed in the solvent blend at room temperature, and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 1 h. The cellulose suspension was frozen at −20 °C for 24 h. Then, the mixture was thawed at room temperature stirring vigorously during 1 h to obtain a transparent solution. A defined volume was cast in Petri dish to reach a 0.5 mm thick layer, and then immersed in a coagulation bath of 4% (v/v) acetic acid to regenerate. The resulting wet films were washed with running distillate water until pH 7 and then immersed in a final bath with a mixture of chitosan and PVA. Finally, the films were dried on the Petri dish at room temperature for 2 days. The dried films were peeled from the plates and samples were cut to specific sizes for each test. The samples were stored in desiccators for 5 days at 51% or 0% relative humidity (RH) as required for each test."
3,Film thickness measurement and mechanical properties,"2.2 Film thickness measurement and mechanical properties Thickness (mm) was measured at 5 locations of each film using a Thickness Meter ET115S (Etari GmbH, Stuttgart, Germany). Measurements were carried out prior to the characterization tests and mean values were reported. Tensile tests of the cellulose films were performed at room temperature using a texturometer with load cell of 30 kg and software Exponent version 6.1.12.0 (TA-XTplus, Stable Micro System, UK), according to the ASTM D882 method (ASTM), with some modifications. Tensile strength (TS), percentage of elongation at break point (%E) and Young's modulus (YM) were measured. An initial grip separation of 40 mm and cross head speed of 4 mm/s were set up. Ten samples of 15 × 100 mm were cut from each film formulation and stored in desiccators at 51% RH for 5 days. The films were fixing at both ends using mechanical grips and the strength was measured. Curves of stress (MPa) as a function of strain (%) were automatically recorded by the texturometer TA-XTplus software. Tensile strength (maximum force divided by film cross-section), deformation at break (extension at the rupture point, mm), percent of elongation at break (deformation divided by initial sample length and multiplying by 100, %) and Young's modulus (yield stress divided by yield strain in the viscoelastic region, MPa) were calculated from the stress–strain curves according to the ASTM D882 method."
4,Water vapour permeability,"2.3 Water vapour permeability Water vapour permeability values were measured gravimetrically following the ASTM E96 method, known as the “cup method”, using an especially designed permeability cell. A wide-mouth cup with a cap allowing 5·10−3 m2 area was filled with distilled water. The film was sealed on the mouth of the cup and placed at 20 °C inside a desiccator with silica gel. Weight was measured each 24 h for 5 days. The slope of del plot of weight vs time was calculated by linear regression (r2 > 0.99). Water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) was calculated as the ratio slope (g/s)/test area (m2). Water vapour permeability (WVP) was calculated according to the combined Fick and Henry laws for gas diffusion through films, using Equation (1): (1) W V P = W V T R · x Δ P Where x (m) is the film thickness and ΔP (Pa) is the differential of water vapour pressure through the film [28]. A driving force of 2339 Pa was used as differential vapour pressure of water. Each test was performed by triplicate."
5,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"2.4 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The films were coated on slides with adhesive carbon tape, metalized with Au and observed using a high-vacuum microscope (JEOL JSM-6360LV, Jeol Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV."
6,Statistical design and analysis,"2.5 Statistical design and analysis The experiments followed a second-order, incomplete, factorial design. Cellulose, chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol concentration were considered as operational variables (denoted A, B and C, respectively) and the effects on the select dependent variable (TS, %E, YM and WVP) were evaluated. The Box–Behnken design [29] was used. Table 1 summarizes the experiment design. The statistical analysis was performed by Design Expert® 10.0.6 software (Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Cook's distance was applied the detect outliers [30]."
7,Results and discussion,"Biodegradable films were prepared using cellulose, chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) at several concentrations following the experimental design showed in Table 1. Cellulose ranged from 3 to 5% (w/w), to obtain a complete dissolution of cellulose using NaOH/urea method. Mixing baths of chitosan ranged from 0 to 1% (w/w) and PVA ranged from 0 to 4% (w/w). At higher concentrations of chitosan and PVA, the bath was very viscous resulting in too thick films. The results of the dependent variables (TS, %E, YM and WVP) are also showed in Table 1. The relationship between the independent (cellulose, chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol concentration) and dependent variables (TS, %E, YM and WVP) of the films was modelled using a second-order polynomial equation or partial polynomial equations."
8,Effect on tensile strength (TS),"3.1 Effect on tensile strength (TS) Films obtained showed values of TS in the range from 27.75 to 78.48 MPa. Experimental data fitted well to a linear model. Experiment 12 was ignored because it was detected as an outliner. The multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) is shown in Table 2 . F-value was 9.48 (p-value = 0.0029) implying that the model was significant. The value of r2 was 0.74, and the adequate precision obtained was 9.38 indicating an adequate signal. The evaluation of F-values of the three variables confirmed that TS was highly affected by the linear effect of cellulose and chitosan concentration. PVA concentration slightly affected TS properties. Equation (2) predicts the response of TS for real variables. (2) T S ( M P a ) = − 5.97 + 10.15 C e l l u l o s e ( % ) + 20.17 C h i t o s a n ( % ) + 2.59 P V A ( % ) The response surface describing the effect of the concentration of cellulose, chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol on TS is shown in Fig. 1 . In general, TS values increase by increasing cellulose and chitosan concentration. PVA concentration also affected this value, although with a lower effect, reaching higher TS values at higher cellulose, chitosan and PVA concentration. Keeping constant the concentration of chitosan and PVA, by increasing the cellulose concentration, TS value increased from 45.58 to 78.48 MPa. For other hand, keeping constant the cellulose and chitosan concentration, TS values increased from 55.44 to 78.48 MPa when the PVA concentration increased. Similar effect was observed keeping constant cellulose and PVA concentration as and increasing chitosan concentration TS values changed from 47.16 to 66.53 MPa. Comparing with literature, a TS value of 25.64 MPa for PVA films prepared from a dissolution of 2.3% (w/v) is reported [31]. Films with PVA at 5% (w/w) showed a TS ranging from 40 to 50 MPa [25]. Chitosan films prepared with 1–2% (w/v) showed TS values ranging from 22.2 to 79 MPa [18,22,31–33]. Variations in TS values in chitosan films could be due to several factors, including chitosan composition, chitosan source, film preparation and storage [33]. Cellulose-based films from cotton linter at 4% (w/w) using NaOH/thiourea as solvent and H2SO4 as coagulation bath, showed TS values of 68.10 MPa [34]. Cellulose-based films from a 5% (w/w) solution, using NaOH/urea as solvent and acetic acid as coagulation bath, had TS values from 60 to 90 MPa as a function of the molecular weight (2.2·104–8.2·104 g/mol) [35]. TS values obtained in this work are in the same range of those reported in literature. The model obtained suggests that tensile strength of the blend films was dominated by cellulose. Interactions between cellulose and chitosan at higher concentrations resulted in higher TS values. This behavior can be explained by the formation of hydrogen bonds between both polymeric chains. Blend films of cellulose and chitosan, prepared using N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide as solvent also showed increased TS values when the concentration of chitosan was increased [12]. The same authors reported lower TS values for cellulose films using N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide as cellulose solvent compared to those values obtained in this study. Mechanical properties depend on the solvent employed and the molecular weight of cellulose used as raw material [36]."
9,Effect on elongation at break (%E),"3.2 Effect on elongation at break (%E) Films showed values of %E in the range from 0.98% to 12.82%. Experimental data fitted well to a two-factor interaction equation. Experiment 11 was ignored because it was detected as an outliner. The multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) is shown in Table 2. The F-value of the quadratic equation was 45.41 (p-value = 0.0365) implying that the model was significant. The value of r2 was 0.79. The adequate precision ratio obtained (7.51) was higher than 4 indicating an adequate signal. The F-values of the three variables confirmed that %E was highly affected by the linear effect of the chitosan concentration, and the effect of the interaction chitosan-PVA, followed by the linear effect of PVA concentration. Small effect of the cellulose concentration was observed. The interaction cellulose-PVA was negligible. Equation (3) predicts the response on %E. (3) % E = 2.73 − 0.025 · C e l l u l o s e % − 6.79 · C h i t o s a n % − 1.29 · P V A % + 1.19 · C e l l u l o s e % · C h i t o s a n % + 0.01 · C e l l u l o s e % · P V A % + 3.60 · C h i t o s a n % · P V A % The response surface of the model is shown in Fig. 2 . Overall increasing PVA and chitosan concentration, %E values increases. The maximum value of %E (12.82%) was reached at the highest concentration of chitosan and PVA, reflecting the effect of the interaction between these two polymers. Increasing cellulose concentration at lower concentration of chitosan and PVA, the value of %E increased slightly from 3.04 to 6.09%. In previous research, cellulose-based films at 5% (w/w) solution, using NaOH/urea as solvent and acetic acid as coagulation bath, reported %E values from 2 to 5%, as a function of the molecular weight (2.2·104–8.2·104 g/mol) [35]. Cellulose-based films from a 4% (w/w) solution of cotton linter using NaOH/thiourea as solvent and H2SO4 as coagulation bath, showed a %E value of 6.98% [34]. Cellulose-based films at 4% (w/w) solution showed values ranging from 1.9 to 2.9% as a function of the molecular weight using NaOH/urea, LiCl/DMAc system and NMMO and ionic liquids as solvent [36]. On the other hand, a %E value of 105.47% was reported for films prepared from a 2.3% (w/v) solution of PVA, similar to the values between 100 and 115% reported for films from PVA at 5% (w/w) [25,31]. Comparing %E of chitosan films in literature, several studies reported %E values for pure chitosan films in the range from 13 to 53.85%, most of them in the lower values [18,33,37,38]. The variability in the values depends on chitosan composition, chitosan source, film preparation and storage conditions. PVA had a plasticizing effect, consequently intermolecular hydrogen bonds were formed between PVA and cellulose molecules, weakening the hydrogen bonds between cellulose chains. The interaction with PVA increased the mobility of cellulose chains. This plasticizing effect was also observed in regenerated cellulose films bathed with glycerol [34,39]. In our study, PVA and chitosan improved elastic properties of cellulose-based films reaching %E values higher than those of cellophane, a commercial cellulose derivate. However, %E values were far from those of synthetic polymers (633–859%) [3]."
10,Effect on Young's modulus (YM),"3.3 Effect on Young's modulus (YM) The films showed YM values in the range from 2727.04 to 4217.25 MPa. Experiment 11 was ignored because it was detected as an outliner. Experimental data fitted well to a quadratic model. The multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) is shown in Table 2. The F-value of the two-factors interaction equation was 6.27 (p-value = 0.0146) implying that the model was significant. The value of r2 was 0.84. The adequate precision ratio obtained (10.52) was greater than 4 indicating an adequate signal. F-values of the three variables showed that YM was highly affected by the linear effect of the chitosan concentration, followed by the interaction chitosan-PVA. Cellulose concentration and interaction cellulose-chitosan also affected the Young's modulus values, but the effect was smaller than that observed by the chitosan concentration and the interaction chitosan-PVA. Finally, the effect of PVA concentration and the interaction cellulose-PVA concentrations were negligible. Equation (4) predicts the response of YM. (4) Y M = 2562.98 + 212.65 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) + 1362.86 · C h i t o s a n ( % ) + 116.49 · P V A ( % ) − 307.62 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) · C h i t o s a n ( % ) + 35.60 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) · P V A ( % ) − 457.65 · C h i t o s a n ( % ) · P V A ( % ) The response surface of the model is shown in Fig. 3 . Young's modulus values of the developed films depend mainly on the interaction between chitosan and PVA. The maximum values were obtained when PVA or chitosan were used in the bath formulation. A negative interaction between chitosan and PVA was observed decreasing the Young's modulus values. Therefore, increasing chitosan and PVA concentration, decreased Young's modulus values from 4217.25 MPa (without chitosan) and 3750 MPa (without PVA) to 3150.48 MPa when both polymers were added into the formulation. Formulation with PVA had higher Young's modulus values than formulation with chitosan. Also, in formulations containing PVA, increasing the cellulose concentration increased Young's modulus values. The opposite effect was observed combining chitosan with cellulose resulting in a decreasing of Young's modulus values. The maximum values of Young's modulus were observed in films from formulation containing maximum concentration of PVA and cellulose. In literature, Young's modulus values of chitosan films from 1 to 2% (w/w) solutions have been reported ranging from 1874 to 3000 MPa [18]. Variations in Young's modulus values of chitosan films depend on concentration, molecular weight, degree of polymerization, storage conditions and preparation method. Also, decreasing the degree of polymerization negatively affected Young's modulus of chitosan films [18]. Films from PVA at 5% (w/w) showed Young's modulus values in the 1000–1500 MPa range [23,25]. Regenerated cellulose, using ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride as solvent, showed a Young's modulus value of 1800 MPa [40]. Regenerated-cellulose films from 6% (w/w) cellulose solution mixed with NaOH, urea, ZnO and distilled water, showed a Young's modulus value of 6100 MPa, and 3700 MPa for cellulose films from 7% (w/w) cellulose solution with NaOH and urea [41], indicating that Young's modulus values of regenerated cellulose films depend on the cellulose concentration, solvent method and preparation conditions. Regenerated-cellulose films showed higher Young's modulus values than those of chitosan and PVA films suggesting that mechanical properties in the obtained films are driven by the cellulose content. Increasing PVA or chitosan concentration allowed obtaining higher Young's modulus values. This behavior could be explained due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed between PVA and cellulose, or chitosan and cellulose. Higher Young's modulus values were obtained blending PVA-cellulose than chitosan-cellulose. However, using both PVA and chitosan in the formulation resulted in lower Young's modulus values. Probably, the interaction between PVA and chitosan was not as strong as the interaction of each polymers alone with cellulose."
11,Effect on water vapour permeability (WVP),"3.4 Effect on water vapour permeability (WVP) Obtained films showed WVP values in the range from 1.78·10−11 to 4.24·10−11 g/m s Pa. Experimental data were well fitted using a quadratic equation. The multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) is shown in Table 2. The F-value of the two-factors interaction in the mathematical model was 13.75 (p-value = 0.0008) implying that the model was significant. The value of r2 was 0.91. The adequate precision ratio obtained (11.35) was greater than 4 indicating an adequate signal. The F-values of the three variables showed that water vapour permeability was highly affected by the cellulose-chitosan and cellulose-PVA interactions. The linear effect of cellulose, chitosan, PVA concentration and the interaction chitosan-PVA showed a smaller effect on the water vapour permeability. Equation (5) predicts the response on water vapour permeability. (5) W V P = − 4.66 · 10 − 11 + 1.88 · 10 − 11 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) + 6.85 · 10 − 11 · C h i t o s a n ( % ) + 1.42 · 10 − 11 · P V A ( % ) − 1.74 · 10 − 11 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) · C h i t o s a n ( % ) − 3.67 · 10 − 11 C e l l u l o s e ( % ) · P V A ( % ) + 3.24 · 10 − 12 · C h i t o s a n ( % ) · P V A ( % ) The response surface of the model is shown in Fig. 4 . The water vapour permeability of the films depends mainly on the cellulose-chitosan and cellulose-PVA interaction. In films obtained from a combination of cellulose with chitosan or PVA, at low chitosan or PVA concentrations, increasing cellulose concentration resulted in higher values of WVP (from 1.86·10−11 to 3.95·10−11 g/m s Pa). On the contrary, at high concentrations of chitosan and PVA, increasing cellulose concentration caused a decreased the WVP values. Keeping cellulose concentration constant, the increase of chitosan and PVA resulted in slight increases of WVP values. This increase was less significant than the effect due to the increase of cellulose concentration. The effect of cellulose on WVP was smaller when chitosan or PVA were added into the film formulation. When adding both the chitosan and the PVA into the formulation, the VWP values were increased, especially at lower concentration of cellulose. The obtained results agree with values reported in literature. Films from 1% (w/v) chitosan solution, showed WVP in the 1.5·10−10-6.9·10−10 g/m·s·Pa range, depending on the molecular weight and the solvent used [15,42,43]. PVA films showed WVP values between 1.2·10−11 and 1.7·10−11 g/m·s·Pa [15,44]. Fish gelatin films also showed similar WVP values (0.38 × 10−10 g/m s Pa) [45]. WVP of biodegradable films depends on several factors including structure, ratio of crystalline and amorphous zones, hydrophilic–hydrophobic ratio and interaction between the main polymeric chains and presence of plasticizers or other additives [13]. WVP values obtained in the composite films were driven by cellulose permeability properties. WVP values increased when chitosan and PVA concentration increased due to the high permeability of these component which are more hydrophilic than cellulose. Cellulose permeability depends on its crystallinity as high-crystalline regions are inaccessible to water molecules. Cellulose also contains a para-crystalline component (amorphous area) which is accessible to water molecules, thus making them hydrophilic [28]. Water molecules preferably diffuse through amorphous areas of the polymer matrix, so the degree of crystallinity is also important in the permeability behavior of films [22]. Increasing cellulose concentration, resulted in higher WVP values, probably due to the increasing of amorphous areas promoting water molecules diffusion. WVP values in the 1.0–1.5·10−13 and 3–4·10−14 g/m·s·Pa range have been reported for low density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) films, respectively, at 90% RH and 38 °C. The water vapour permeability values of transparent cellulose films are up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than the those of polyethylene films [28]. For other hand, WVP values of developed films in this work were in the same range as those of cellophane (8.4.10−11 g/m s Pa), due to the similar chemical structure of both polymers [46]."
12,Microstructure,"3.5 Microstructure In previous studies, films with chitosan has a slight yellowish colour [46]. Fig. 5 shows that the films obtained were translucent. Perhaps the colour of the cited study can be due to impurities in the chitosan used. The surfaces of both sides are different as showed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) employed to analyse the morphology of the film surfaces. Fig. 6 shows the top and bottom surface of the films obtained in experiments 1, 5 and 6. The selected experiments allowed analysing the effect of the cellulose (3% or 5%) and chitosan (0% or 1%) on the surface at constant PVA concentration (2%). Bottom side showed a smoother and continuous surface, probably because this side was in contact with the Petri dish when the films were formed. Both surfaces depended on the composition of the blending. Films showed a continuous matrix, no pores or cracks were detected, indicating a dense structure. Surface of films with lower cellulose concentration looked more homogeneous than films with higher cellulose content that have a rougher surface. The rough surface of composite films with higher cellulose content was reduced adding chitosan. Previous studies using different coagulation media and conditions showed also a decrease in voids and cracks increasing PVA and chitosan [27]."
13,Conclusions,"The polynomial models allowed selecting the formulation of cellulose-chitosan-PVA to prepare films with similar TS values of synthetic polymer films. The combination of cellulose-based films with chitosan and PVA, improved %E values compared to pure cellulose films. Chitosan and PVA, showed a plasticizing effect on the cellulose-based films, due to interactions among the polymers. However, %E values of the developed films are far from those of synthetic polymers, as LDPE and HDPE, but they have better elongation properties than commercial cellophane. Interaction between cellulose-chitosan or cellulose-PVA showed an important effect on Young's modulus values, increasing YM values when PVA or chitosan concentration increased. Blending PVA-cellulose resulted in higher YM values than those of chitosan-cellulose films; although using PVA and chitosan resulted in lower YM values due to a stronger interaction between PVA and chitosan than the interaction of both polymers with cellulose. WVP values were 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of synthetic polymers. Composite films had lower WVP values than those of pure PVA and chitosan films. Therefore, the combination of cellulose with PVA or chitosan improved WVP properties. Results showed that it is feasible to obtain cellulose-chitosan-polyvinyl alcohol composite films with improved mechanical properties and water vapour permeability. Results of this study could provide valuable information on fabricating cellulosic materials, further expanding cellulose applications."
