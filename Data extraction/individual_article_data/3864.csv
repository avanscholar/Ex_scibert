0,Introduction,"Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation (TH) has emerged as a simple, cheap and, mainly, safe way to hydrogenate substrates because it avoids the use of high pressure vessels and compressed H2 or other hazardous reagents (NaBH4, LiAlH4, etc). The hydrogen atoms transferred in the reaction come from another molecule that usually acts as solvent (e.g. an alcohol), generally originating only benign by-products, thus making TH an alternative to classic hydrogenation. For this reason, TH is now widely employed for the reduction of unsaturated organic molecules [1]. In particular, ketone hydrogenation is a reaction of interest because it has been used in the production of intermediary alcohols, which are important building blocks in fine chemistry, agrochemistry, food and fragrances, materials, etc [2]. Even when examples of catalytic systems based on other metals have been reported [3], ruthenium, rhodium and iridium precursors are still typically chosen for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones. Many examples of either TH catalysis or tandem procedures including TH have been reported [4,5]. In particular, iridium-based systems have shown outstanding activities in TH of ketones [6]. The most widely used precursors [7] bear phosphines or similar ligands [8], other phosphorus-containing chelating ligands (P,N; P,P; P,N,P; P,P,P; etc.) [9], and N-heterocyclic carbenes [10] which might also contain a second donor group such as a phosphine. In most of these, the metal center is Ir(III). Examples of Ir(I)-based systems in transfer hydrogenation reactions are less common [7]. In previous works, our group reported the use of iridium(I) complexes bearing bulky phosphines as ligands (PBn3 =tribenzylphosphine, PAn3 =tris(ortho-anisyl)phosphine) in the catalytic hydrogenation of imines and trans-cinnamaldehyde using molecular hydrogen [11,12]. Herein we report the TH of ketones from isopropyl alcohol under basic conditions, catalyzed by cationic Ir(I) complexes bearing the bulky phosphines mentioned above (see Fig. 1 ). Commercial isopropanol was used, without drying treatment, which is interesting since for higher scale applications the use of dry solvents represents an increase in operational costs. A complete catalytic evaluation (reaction conditions, type and quantity of base, hydrogen source, temperature, scope of substrates, etc) is presented. Also the kinetic dependence on the concentration of substrate was determined, and stoichiometric as well as in situ tests were performed to gain some insight into the reaction pathways involved in this transfer hydrogenation."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and methods,"2.1 Materials and methods All reactions and manipulations were routinely performed under dry nitrogen or argon atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. Complexes [Ir(COD)(PPh3)2]PF6 (1) [13], [Ir(COD)(PBn3)2]PF6 (2) [14], [Ir(COD)(PBn3)(PAn3)]PF6 (3) [12] and cis-(P,P)-[IrH(COD)(PBn3){η2-P,C-(C6H4CH2)PBn2}]PF6 (4) [14] were synthesized according to literature procedures. Isopropyl alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) was used as received without further purification. Other solvents and deuterated solvents were used as received from the commercial source without further purification. NMR samples were prepared taking 0.4mL of the reaction mixture and using a DMSO-d 6 inner tube. Solution 1H, 13C{1H} and 31P{1H} NMR spectra were recorded either on Bruker Avance 300, 500 or 600MHz spectrometers at Laboratorio Nacional de Resonancia Magnética Nuclear, Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas (IVIC). Peak positions are relative to tetramethylsilane, for 1H and 13C{1H}, and phosphoric acid, for 31P{1H}. The chemical shifts (δ) are measured according to IUPAC [15], expressed in parts per million (ppm) and were calibrated against the residual solvent resonance (1H) or the deuterated solvent multiplet (13C). All NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature (25°C) unless otherwise stated. The multiplicity of the signals is indicated ass, d, t, q, or m for singlets, doublets, triplets, quartets, or multiplets, respectively. The abbreviation br. is given for broadened signals. Quaternary carbon atoms are indicated as Cquat and aromatic units as CHar."
3,Catalytic tests,"2.2 Catalytic tests 2.2.1 Catalyst screening The appropriate catalyst (1–4, 9μmol, 0.5mol%) was added to a Schlenk flask. Air was purged by three vacuum/gas (N2) cycles. i PrOH (3.3mL) was added with a syringe and H2 was bubbled into the solution at atmospheric pressure for 1min. Then, acetophenone (1.85mmol) and base from a freshly prepared stock solution of KOH in i PrOH (90µmol, 200µL from stock solution 0.45mol/L) were added with a syringe. A reflux condenser was connected to the Schlenk and the system was heated to 80°C in an oil bath. After the specified reaction time (2 or 20h) the heating was stopped and the conversion was determined by 1H NMR. 2.2.2 Optimization of reaction conditions The catalyst (3, 9µmol, 0.5mol%) was added to a Schlenk flask. Air was purged by three vacuum/gas (N2) cycles. Then, acetophenone (1.85mmol), the hydrogen source (3.3mL), and the base (90µmol, 200µL from a stock solution in the corresponding hydrogen source at concentration of 0.45mol/L) were added with a syringe. When needed, a reflux condenser was connected to the Schlenk and the system was heated to 80°C in an oil bath. After the specified reaction time (2 or 20h) the heating was stopped and the yield was determined by 1H NMR. 2.2.3 Screening of substrates A general procedure was applied depending on the physical state of the substrate, as follows: a. For solid ketones: The catalyst (3, 9µmol) and the ketone (1.85mmol) were added to a Schlenk flask. Air was purged by three vacuum/gas (N2) cycles. Degassed i PrOH (3.3mL) was added, followed by base from a freshly prepared stock solution of KOH in i PrOH (90µmol, 200µL from stock solution 0.45mol/L). A reflux condenser was connected to the Schlenk and the system was heated to 80°C in an oil bath. After the reaction time (24h) the heating was stopped and the yield was determined by 1H NMR. b. For liquid ketones: The catalyst (3, 9µmol) was added to a Schlenk flask. Air was purged by three vacuum/gas (N2) cycles. Then, the ketone (1.85mmol), i PrOH (3.3mL), and KOH (90µmol, 200µL from stock i PrOH solution 0.45mol/L) were added with a syringe. A reflux condenser was connected to the Schlenk and the system was heated to 80°C in an oil bath. After the reaction time (24h) the heating was stopped and the yield was determined by 1H NMR."
4,Assessment of catalyst’s stability,"2.3 Assessment of catalyst’s stability The catalyst (3, 9µmol) was added to a Schlenk flask. Air was purged by three vacuum/gas (N2) cycles. Then, acetophenone (1.85mmol), i PrOH (3.3mL), and KOH (90µmol, 200µL from stock i PrOH solution 0.45mol/L) were added with a syringe. A reflux condenser was connected to the Schlenk and the system was heated to 80°C in an oil bath. Every 24h, a sample from the reaction media was withdrawn, placed on an NMR tube with a sealed inner tube filled with DMSO-d6 , and a 1H NMR control was taken. After the spectroscopic measurement, the sample was returned to the Schlenk flask and a further load of acetophenone (1.85×(1−c∗) mmol, where c∗ is the normalized residual amount of unconverted ketone from the previous run)/ i PrOH (1.85×(1−c∗) mmol) was added. In total, 3 additional loads of acetophenone were used."

6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalytic tests,"3.1 Catalytic tests The catalytic transfer hydrogenation of ketones was initially studied using acetophenone as model substrate. The evaluation of complexes 1–4 in the hydrogenation of this substrate led to the results summarized in Table 1 . Precursors 1 and 3 yielded the best results, with conversions toward the corresponding alcohol (at 20h) of 95 and 97% and TONs of 195 and 199 respectively (corresponding to TOF=47h−1 and 53h−1). Complexes 2 and 4 were less efficient than 1 and 3, affording yields of alcohol of 88 and 81% in a 20h reaction. The latter are structurally related, given the fact that 4 is the result of a C–H activation reaction on one of the benzyl groups of one of the PBn3 ligands in 2, as previously described [14]. In this sense, the slightly lower yield of product obtained when 2 was used as catalyst precursor, might be due to the parallel ortho-metallation reaction, which lowers the efficiency of the transfer hydrogenation. The lower performance of precursor 4, given the fact that the complex is coordinatively saturated, might be attributed to the lack of a vacant site to coordinate the substrate. Given this fact, complex 4 would require previous de-coordination of a phosphine ligand or displacement of the metallation reaction toward the Ir(I) species [14] to perform as efficiently as 2. In light of the results obtained and considering that one of the main purposes of this investigation was to study the effect of bulky phosphine ligands PBn3 and PAn3, complex 3 was selected as catalyst of choice for the rest of the catalytic evaluation, even when its efficiency is only slightly better than that of the system based in 1. Transfer hydrogenation reactions with iridium catalysts have been proposed to proceed via three main mechanistic pathways [16], two of them involving an Ir-hydride intermediate and the last one a direct transfer of hydrogen (Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley type). Considering this fact, the screening of catalysts (Table 1) was carried out by performing an initial pretreatment with molecular H2 (bubbling for 1min at atmospheric pressure) to promote the generation of hydridic species product of oxidative addition. In this sense, once compound 3 was selected as catalyst precursor, the relevance of this pretreatment with H2(g), as well as the rest of the conditions that might influence the system, were studied (see Table 2 ). It was determined that the pretreatment with H2(g) was not necessary for this system, since the results obtained after this pretreatment and without it are essentially identical (Table 2, entries 1 and 2). This evidence suggests that the generation of a dihydride Ir(III) intermediate might not be involved in a possible reaction pathway for the hydrogen transfer from isopropyl alcohol to ketones using complex 3 as catalyst precursor. However, this observation would not exclude the possible generation of hydridic (monohydridic) species resulting from β-elimination from a coordinated ligand, e.g. an isopropoxide. In any case, considering that the previous H2 bubbling seems unnecessary, the rest of the tests were carried out without H2(g) pretreatment. The influence of the amount and nature of the base was also studied. If no base is added, no conversion is observed (Table 2, entry 3), thus confirming the need to use a base and, probably, shedding light into the possible reaction pathway. When a strong inorganic base (KOH, 5mol%) was used to generate in situ the corresponding isopropoxide, the reaction proceeds with excellent conversion (96%) and good efficiency (TON=197, TOF=47h−1). However, if this amount of base is lowered to 1mol% (Cat:Base=1:2, Table 2, entry 4) the efficiency of the system diminishes considerably (47% conversion, TON=97). The use of a weaker inorganic base such as sodium bicarbonate (Table 2, entry 5) yielded only a 47% conversion. When an organic base (NEt3, Table 2, entry 6) was used, only traces of the product were identified after a 20h period. These tests confirm the need of a strong inorganic base in sufficient amount (5mol%) for the reaction to proceed efficiently. Several examples of Ir-based TH systems also report the use of strong inorganic bases to ensure good results [7,10f]. Attempts to lower the reaction temperature from 80°C to room temperature (Table 2, entry 7) or to use a lower catalyst load (0.05mol%, Table 2, entry 8) led to poorer conversions to the alcohol. The use of a lower catalyst load led, however, to higher values of TON and TOF (596 and 154h−1, respectively). To assess for the possibility of using commercial isopropanol in the system, a comparison between the model reaction (Table 2, entry 2) and a catalytic run using dry solvent (Table 2, entry 9) was performed. The use of “wet” solvent from the bottle yields slightly better results than when dry isopropanol was used. However, when a significant amount of water is intentionally added to the reaction media (5% water, v/v, see Table 2, entry 10) the efficiency of the reaction decreases considerably, converting only a 19% of substrate. This indicates that the system is tolerant to traces of water present in the commercial solvent, but an excess of water hampers the catalytic reaction. Finally, the optimization of the reaction conditions also included a blank run (Table 2, entry 11), in which the catalytic nature of the system was confirmed. Additionally, the reaction was monitored as a function of time to determine the optimum reaction time. The screening was carried out on a Young NMR tube, in a closed system. As it can be seen in Fig. 2 , in the first 5h the reaction is faster. The reaction rate appears to decay progressively after 6h. After 20h no significant changes in conversion were observed. In this sense, it was decided to set 20h as the total reaction time for the rest of the screenings performed. In contrast to the catalytic tests, in the study of the progress of the reaction it was observed that the total conversion was slightly lower (88% vs. 96% observed in previous tests). This slight decrease was attributed to the fact that the test was carried out in a closed system and thus it became impossible to extract the product of dehydrogenation of the solvent, acetone. It is known that in the transfer hydrogenation reaction using isopropanol as hydrogen source the formed acetone can reversibly form back the alcohol [3]. In this sense, it has been reported [17] that extracting the acetone from the reaction media is a key factor in terms of efficiency of the reaction since it allows for the donor-acceptor equilibria in the transfer hydrogenation to shift toward the products. Based on this results, the optimum conditions determined are: catalyst=complex 3; catalyst load=0.5mol%; catalyst:base ratio=1:10; base=KOH; temperature=80°C; reaction time=20h. Under the optimized conditions, different hydrogen sources were also studied to determine the most efficient donor molecule for the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone with this system. The results are shown in Table 3 . Isopropyl alcohol ( i PrOH), which was the solvent of choice for the optimization of the reaction conditions, resulted in the best donor molecule using this system, reflected in the higher conversion to alcohol and TON obtained (Table 3, entry 1). When the reaction was performed in ethyl alcohol, a lower conversion of acetophenone to the corresponding 1-phenylethyl alcohol was obtained (52%, TON=107, Table 3, entry 2). However, the analysis of the mixture obtained revealed the formation of ethyl acetate, the product of dehydrogenative homo-coupling (DHC) of ethyl alcohol, which has been previously described by several authors [18]. Clearly, a competitive reaction between the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone and the dehydrogenative coupling of ethanol is responsible for the lower conversions observed. This indicates that the system using this donor molecule is not selective in the type of catalytic reaction that occurs. Of particular interest was the choice of formic acid or formic acid/formate. It has been proposed [3,6] that these hydrogen sources are a suitable alternative in TH reactions to avoid the reversible formation of the donor molecule after its dehydrogenation. For HCOOH, the dehydrogenated product is CO2 which can be purged from the catalytic system. Unfortunately, under acidic conditions complex 3 does not catalyze the TH reaction of acetophenone (Table 3, entry 3). When sodium formate was added as base in formic acid as media, only 10% of conversion to the alcohol was achieved after a 20h reaction. Interestingly, all of the solvents were used directly from the bottle without drying treatment, indicating that the system is tolerant to traces of water in the reaction media, as stated before for i PrOH (Table 2, entry 2 vs. entry 9)."
8,Assessment of catalyst’s stability,"3.2 Assessment of catalyst’s stability As it was previously discussed, in an attempt to test the ability of the catalytic system to convert higher quantities of ketone, the catalyst load was lowered to 0.05% mol (Table 2, entry 8), obtaining only 29% of alcohol. Given the fact that this approach was unsuccessful, it was decided to test the tolerance and robustness of 3 when consecutive loads of substrate were added to the same amount of catalyst. In a typical catalytic experiment, a catalyst load of 0.5mol% was used. To assess for the catalyst’s stability, the catalyst load was kept in 0.5mol%, and 4 consecutive catalytic runs were performed using the same catalyst used in the first run. Fresh loads of substrate (acetophenone) were added after each period of 24h of reaction, taking into account the amount of non-converted ketone for overall calculations. The total amount of solvent ( i PrOH) was also kept fix (see Supporting information, Fig. S1). Only a slight decrease in conversion was observed between the first and second runs (99% vs. 93% of alcohol). With the third amount of substrate a conversion of 85% was achieved, while with the fourth substrate load a total of 75% of acetophenone was converted to its corresponding alcohol. The total turnover number for this experiment is TON=724, which is even higher than when a catalyst load of 0.05mol% was used. A natural consequence of the method used to perform this experiment is the accumulation of products (benzyl alcohol and any remaining acetone) through the different runs. In this sense, the concentration of catalyst, base and substrate changes from one run to another. From the kinetic point of view this would explain the differences in catalyst activity through the successive runs. Regardless of this fact, this experiment demonstrates the robustness of the catalyst and its high activity as well, since it was possible to hydrogenate three consecutive loads of acetophenone without a significant decay in conversion."
9,Extension of the scope of the catalytic system,"3.3 Extension of the scope of the catalytic system To evaluate the scope of the catalytic system, a series of methyl ketones and one example of an ethyl ketone were studied. The optimum conditions determined for the hydrogenation of acetophenone, using isopropyl alcohol as hydrogen source, were used. The results are presented in Table 4 . To establish proper comparison conditions and to ensure a maximum conversion of the substrates, these reactions were performed in a total reaction time of 24h. The para-substitution of acetophenone has a great influence in the efficiency of the catalytic reaction. Substituted acetophenones bearing either electron donating (Table 4, entry 2) or electron withdrawing (Table 4, entry 3) groups were evaluated and, in both cases, the conversions were lower than the one obtained for the unsubstituted substrate (Table 4, entry 1). In the case of 4-methoxyacetophenone, the substrate converted to the alcohol in moderate yield (69%). A disfavoring effect of the methoxy group in para-position on the iridium-catalyzed TH of 4-methoxyacetophenone has been previously reported for other systems [5]. Very likely, the electron-donating –OMe reduces the electrophilicity of the carbon atom in the carbonyl group. On the other hand, the electron-withdrawing NO2-group completely deactivated the substrate toward the hydrogen transfer reaction (Table 4, entry 3). It would be expected that electron-withdrawing groups favored reduction of the ketone, as described by Crabtree for 4-CF3-PhCOMe [5]. However, in the case of the NO2-substituted acetophenone, decomposition of the catalyst was observed upon mixing of the reactants (the mixture turned immediately black). In other words, catalyst decomposition took place faster than the TH reaction for this particular substrate. On the other hand, 2-pentanone (Table 4, entry 4) was converted to its corresponding alcohol in good yield (90%), thus indicating that the system is efficient for aryl ketones as well as for alkyl ketones. A dramatic drop in efficiency of the catalytic system was observed when 1-adamantyl-methyl ketone was studied. Only 36% of alcohol was obtained for this substrate (Table 4, entry 5), probably due to a combination of steric hindrance and rigidity in the adamantyl substituent. The rigidity of the cyclic adamantyl group might compromise the approach of the substrate to the active site, which is presumably per se sterically hindered. Interestingly, changing the methyl substituent by an ethyl (Table 4 entries 1 vs. 6) markedly affects the conversion toward the alcohol, obtaining only 22% of 1-phenyl-1-propanol. These facts indicate that the system might be sensitive to an increase in steric hindrance in the substrate, due to the inherent bulkiness in catalyst precursor 3. Additionally, the replacement of one of the alpha-protons in acetophenone, PhCOCH2(H), by a methyl group in propiophenone, PhCOCH2(CH3), would make the carbonyl group less electrophilic and consequently less prone to reduction. In this sense, to determine the effects of the substrate steric hindrance on the performance of the catalytic system, a series of cyclic or bulky ketones were evaluated, including substrates with olefins as additional functional groups. The results are summarized in Table 5 . Interestingly, the transfer hydrogenation of cyclohexanone using complex 3 as catalyst precursor proceeds very efficiently, resulting in quantitative conversion of the substrate to cyclohexyl alcohol (Table 5, entry 1). Given this outcome, it resulted interesting to study adamantanone as well, which has a structural analogy (cyclic 6-membered ketone) to cyclohexanone. However, the rigidity of the fused cycles in adamantanone significantly affects the conversion, which drops to 35% (Table 5, entry 2). This is probably due to the difficult hybridization change at the carbon atom resulting from the hydrogenation of the ketone, since the constrained ring might be hampering the Csp2–Csp3 conversion. In the case of benzophenone, it was observed that substitution of a methyl group (Table 4, entry 1) by a phenyl group (Table 5, entry 3) does not significantly affect the catalytic system in terms of conversion. This is in contrast with the behavior observed for the ethyl derivative, in which a lower yield of the alcohol was obtained (Table 4, entry 6). Such results underline the fact that a carbonyl function polarized by an electron-withdrawing substituent (phenyl in this case) is easier to reduce than a carbonyl moiety influenced by an electron-donating group (methyl in this case). Another substrate explored in this study was fluorenone. Interestingly, regardless of the rigidity of fluorenone, a good conversion of 9-fluorenyl alcohol was obtained (76%, Table 5, entry 4). Probably, the planarity of fluorenone allows for a more suitable steric arrangement at the metal than, for example, 1-adamantyl-methyl ketone or adamantanone, thus maintaining the efficiency of the system. From the electronic point of view, as stated before, the carbonyl moiety in fluorenone is activated toward the reduction reaction with respect to propiophenone. Finally, a series of olefin-functionalized cyclohexanones were also studied (Table 5, entries 5–7) to evaluate the selectivity of the transfer hydrogenation toward the carbonyl moiety when another functionality is present in the substrate. In general, the efficiency of the system is the same as in cyclohexanone, since high conversions are obtained in every case (94% or higher conversions). The slight decrease in conversion observed for dihydrocarvone with respect to cyclohexanone might be attributed to the methyl substituent in ortho position to the carbonyl group, which might cause steric hindrance. The isolated olefin moiety was not hydrogenated under these conditions, thus obtaining the unsaturated alcohol dihydrocarveol selectively. However, the presence of conjugated olefin moieties markedly affects the selectivity of the reaction, which proceeds mainly toward the hydrogenation of the CC bond. In this sense, in the hydrogenation of 2-cyclohexenone the main product was the saturated ketone cyclohexanone, while the unsaturated alcohol was only obtained in 6% conversion. Similarly, in the evaluation of carvone the products of hydrogenation of the conjugated olefin as well as of both functional groups were observed, while the conjugated unsaturated alcohol was not detected. Preference toward the olefin moiety in α,β-unsaturated ketones has been also observed in other iridium-based TH systems [10b]. Analogously to the hydrogenation of dihydrocarvone, the isolated CC moiety remained intact after the reaction. Attempts to further extend the scope of the system to other methyl ketones of natural occurrence (such as pinacolone and 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone; Table 5 entries 8 and 9, respectively), highly sterically hindered aryl ketones (such as 2,2,2-triphenylacetophenone; Table 5, entry 10) or diketones (such as 2,4-pentanodione or dimedone; Table 5 entries 11 and 12, respectively) were unsuccessful. These substrates were selected due to their structural analogy to other substrates studied in this work. For example, it resulted interesting to study the hydrogenation of pinacolone (tert-butyl-methyl ketone) since its steric environment resembles that of 1-adamantyl-methyl ketone (Table 4, entry 5) or 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone to determine the electronic influence of a methyl and hydroxyl group in comparison to 2-pentanone (Table 4, entry 4). However, in these cases, the results obtained were different than with their analogues. In particular, in the transfer hydrogenation of pinacolone, previous reports indicate that there has been the need to diminish steric hindrance in the catalyst, for example by using smaller ligands, for an efficient catalysis to occur [19]. Given the fact that catalyst 3 bears two bulky phosphine ligands, it is possible that their steric hindrance hampers the catalytic conversion of pinacolone and analogous substrates."
10,"In situ tests, stoichiometric experiments and kinetic insights","3.4 In situ tests, stoichiometric experiments and kinetic insights A desirable key aspect in the studied TH reaction would be to determine the nature of the active species in the reaction. Ir-hydride complexes have been indicated as active species in two of the mechanistic proposals discussed in the literature [7,10f,16, 20]. It has been already discussed that, essentially, there is no difference in performing the catalytic reaction with a H2 pretreatment (generation of metallic dihydrides [21], see Table 2, entries 1 and 2) or without it. This could indicate that Ir(III)-dihydride species might not be participating in the reaction. However, Ir(I) monohydridic complexes could also result from a β-hydrogen elimination from, e.g., a coordinated isopropoxide ligand, and their possible role in this TH cannot be excluded. This would require the presence of a base to generate the isopropoxide ligand in situ. In this sense, in situ tests were performed at the NMR scale to investigate the role of the base and to assess on the possible formation of hydridic species that could be proposed as active species. In an initial experiment, complex 3 was treated with i PrOH in an organic solvent (CH2Cl2) to determine possible interactions between the catalyst and the solvent. No reaction was observed after 2h on the 31P{1H} NMR spectra as the signals of the coordinated phosphine ligands remained unchanged (δ =13.6 and −10.8). After this period, acetophenone was added to the reaction mixture and, again, no changes were observed. The reaction mixture was left overnight at room temperature, and it was noticed that the complex did not react either with i PrOH or the ketone. Upon additional heating at 60°C for two hours, the resonances of 3 persisted. No base was added in this experiment, which suggests then that 3 does not react with the alcohol or ketone in absence of base, thus confirming the result obtained on the catalytic run in absence of base (Table 2, entry 3). In another experiment, complex 3 was suspended in neat i PrOH. The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum reveals, consistently, no reaction with the alcohol. Upon addition of KOH, the color of the complex immediately changes (from deep red to yellow) and the suspended red solid dissolves. The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum shows complete conversion of 3 into two new species (δ =5.4 and 12.7) and free PAn3 (δ =−38.4). The PF6 − resonance disappears, which could indicate that the observed species, unlike 3, are not cationic and that PF6 − anion has been removed as KPF6 (s). No hydrides were detected by 1H NMR (10 to −30ppm). After this, acetophenone was added. The resonances at 5.4 and 12.7ppm in the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum progressively disappear leading to a new signal at 10.2ppm, which accumulates in time. Again, no hydrides were detected by 1H NMR (10 to −30ppm). The fact that hydridic species were not observed does not exclude its (their) possible involvement in this reaction, since it (they) could not be accumulating in sufficient amount to be detectable. Also, such species could be participating in reaction (s) fast enough so it (they) cannot be seen in the NMR timescale. Another important feature would be to determine whether the activation of the precursor 3 for this transfer hydrogenation occurs upon dissociation of one of the coordinated ligands. In the classic hydrogenation of CX (X=C, N, O) bonds catalyzed by cationic (COD)Ir-bis(phosphine) complexes, it has been proposed that the 1,5-COD ligand is hydrogenated and, thus, it dissociates from the metal coordination sphere producing cyclooctane [11,12,14,22]. However, in those cases, an Ir-dihydride active species has been proposed, and the evidence obtained in this work seems to indicate that these types of species do not participate in this hydrogen transfer system. Additionally, the spectroscopic evidence (1H NMR) obtained does not suggest decoordination of the 1,5-COD ligand. According to the in situ test described above, upon addition of the base to an i PrOH suspension of 3, not only the complex dissolves completely, but free PAn3 is observed in the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum. This would indicate that, very likely, one phosphine (particularly PAn3) dissociates to generate a vacancy for the coordination of the alkoxide ligand or the substrate. However, this observation does not, a priori, exclude the possible dissociation of another type of ligand, such as 1,5-COD, or the formation of another type of intermediate. In this sense, to investigate on these possibilities, individual experiments in presence of either an excess of phosphine ligand or an excess of 1,5-COD were performed. A catalytic run in presence of an excess of phosphine (PAn3, catalyst 3:phosphine ratio=1:10) was carried out. Under these conditions, the conversion of acetophenone to the alcohol was significantly affected, obtaining only 32% of alcohol. The inhibition of the reaction might indicate that the dissociation of a phosphine ligand could be involved in the reaction pathway for this transfer hydrogenation. Nevertheless, the possibility that the excess of phosphine could hamper substrate/ i PrO− coordination should not be neglected. In any case, considering the results of the previously described in situ reaction along with the catalysis in presence of an excess of PAn3, it seems more likely that the decreased conversion in this catalytic test is the result of a displacement of the dissociation equilibrium for the phosphine ligand toward the original species. Additionally, a catalytic test was performed in presence of an excess of 1,5-COD. In this experiment, upon addition of an excess of 1,5-COD (catalyst 3:COD ratio=1:10) under the optimized conditions of the model reaction (transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone), the conversion of the substrate was 97% (20h reaction). This result is essentially the same as the one obtained in the model reaction (97% in presence of an excess of 1,5-COD vs. 96% in the model reaction, difference within the experimental error). This could indicate that an excess of 1,5-COD has no effect on the catalysis. However, with the intention of further excluding a possible role of an excess of 1,5-COD in the TH of acetophenone, an in situ test on the NMR scale (1H, 31P{1H}) was performed. In the in situ test, first, complex 3 was suspended in i PrOH. The signals of complex 3 are barely detectable in the 31P{1H} spectra since it is in suspension. In the 1H NMR spectrum in broad spectral window (10 to −30ppm) no hydrides were detected. Base (KOH/ i PrOH) was added, upon which the solution changed color from red to yellow, and the red solid dissolved. The 31P{1H} spectrum showed two species (δ =5.4 and 12.7). No hydrides were detected in the 1H NMR spectrum. First acetophenone and then 1,5-COD (catalyst 3:COD ratio=1:10) were added to the reaction mixture. The sample was kept at room temperature for two hours and, again, the resonances at δ =5.4 and 12.7 persisted, and free PAn3 was observed (δ =−38.4). Then, the mixture was heated at 60°C for 0.5h, yielding a new signal in δ =10.2 along with the signal attributed to OPBn3 and free PAn3. No hydrides were detected. The signal in δ =10.2 has also been identified in the model in situ test, and accumulates in time. The behavior observed in this in situ test is the same as the in situ test and monitoring of the model transfer hydrogenation, which suggests that 1,5-COD is not influencing the reaction, and confirming the results obtained in the catalytic run. This suggests that it is not likely that a dissociation of 1,5-COD could take place in the transfer hydrogenation of ketones using catalyst 3, since an excess of 1,5-COD has no influence on the reaction. In order to elaborate on the possible identity of the species at 5.4 and 12.7ppm observed in the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum, an additional in situ NMR test in neat i PrOH was performed. In such experiment catalyst precursor 2, which contains exclusively PBn3, was used under identical conditions of the corresponding test with 3. The common resonances in these two in situ reactions are the one attributed to OPBn3 and the one at 5.4ppm. Moreover, in the experiment with 3, when the relative amount of free PAn3 decreases, the relative amount of the resonance at 12.7 increases. These two facts might suggest that the species at 5.4ppm contains solely PBn3, while the compound at 12.7ppm bears only PAn3 as P-based ligand. Since 1,5-COD is not fully dissociated (hemilability is not ruled out) and given that the complexes must be neutral, it could be proposed that species “[Ir(COD)(iOPr)(L)] (L=PBn3 or PAn3)” could be forming. With the available data, such proposition is merely speculative and no additional discussion regarding the identity of the resonance at 10.2ppm can be performed. The elucidation of these compounds (δ =5.4, 10.2 and 12.7) will be matter of further studies. In order to investigate on the role of the P-ligands, two additional experiments were performed using the phosphine-free complex [Ir(COD)(μ-Cl)]2 (5) as catalyst precursor. The optimum conditions of the model reaction were reproduced for this precursor (1.85mmol acetophenone, 92μmol KOH, 4.5×2μmol Ir, 3.5mL i PrOH, 80°C, 20h). In the first test, [Ir(COD)(μ-Cl)]2 (5) was used as catalyst precursor while in the second experiment 5 in presence of a ten-fold excess of 1,5-COD was chosen. The dimer reduced 12% and 56% acetophenone after 2 and 20h of reaction respectively. By adding a ten-fold excess of 1,5-COD, the reaction yielded 12% and 79% acetophenone after 2 and 20h of reaction, respectively. Undoubtedly, in this particular system an excess of 1,5-COD has an significant effect on the catalytic activity upon 20h of reaction. Regardless of that, the catalytic performance of 3 is significantly higher than that of [Ir(COD)(μ-Cl)]2 (5) or [Ir(COD)(μ-Cl)]2/1,5-COD: 96% vs. 56% or 79% (20h) respectively. The other Ir(I) precursors used for this study, 1 and 2, are more efficient than the 5/1,5-COD system as well. In this sense, the experiments using phosphine-free precursors underline the importance of the presence of the phosphorus-based ligands PBn3 and PAn3 in the Ir(I) catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation reaction described herein. It was also possible to obtain kinetic information for the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone catalyzed by 3. From the monitoring of the progress of the reaction (described before, see Fig. 2) it was possible to obtain data for the consumption of ketone as a function of time for the first 8h of catalytic reaction. A plot of the Ln([ketone]/[ketone]0) vs. time (see Supporting information, Fig. S3) returns a straight line, which reveals a pseudo first-order dependence of the rate of reaction on the concentration of ketone. An apparent constant kapp =0.162h−1 was obtained from the slope of the straight line, and a rate law r=kapp[ketone] can be proposed at a constant catalyst concentration, since kapp =kcat[catalyst]a. Given the fact that the hydrogen donor is the solvent of the reaction, its concentration is higher than needed at any time and, thus, it can be considered constant as well."
11,Conclusions,"The transfer hydrogenation of ketones was accomplished, using [Ir(COD)(PBn3)(PAn3)]PF6 (3) as catalyst precursor and isopropyl alcohol as hydrogen source. The system converts a variety of methyl ketones and cyclic ketones. 12 examples of ketones were hydrogenated to their corresponding alcohols, in general with good to excellent yields (69 to >99% in 9 cases). However, substrates with higher steric hindrance could not be converted to the corresponding alcohols. In the case of α,β-unsaturated ketones, selectivity toward the reduction of the CC bond was observed. Nevertheless, the system shows chemoselectivity toward the reduction of the carbonyl group in molecules which also bear an isolated CC moiety. The use of a strong base is necessary for the activation of the catalyst. The loss of a phosphine ligand during the catalysis was demonstrated. It was also proven that an excess of 1,5-COD ligand has no effect on the reaction. A pseudo first-order dependence of the rate of reaction on ketone concentration was determined. Further studies are being carried out to extend the scope of the system to the hydrogenation of aldehydes and gain more insights on the possible reaction pathway for this system when [Ir(COD)(PBn3)(PAn3)]PF6 (3) is used as catalyst precursor."
