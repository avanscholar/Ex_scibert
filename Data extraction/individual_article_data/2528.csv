0,Introduction,"Biodiesel, whose main components are methyl esters, is a new kind of clean-burning and environmental-friendly diesel fuel. Moreover, due to the lower combustion emission profile and lower pollution emissions, biodiesel has gained wide attention during the past decade [1]. It will represent one of the most significant alternatives to conventional petrodiesel fuel in the future. Esterification has been used as a traditional technic for biodiesel production [2,3]. The traditional esterification is often catalyzed by homogeneous strong acid catalysts, such as sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, which has a high catalytic efficiency [4]. The drawbacks of the homogeneous strong acid catalysts are difficult separation from the reaction medium, strong corrosion for equipment and detrimental effects of the acidic liquid on environment. Solid acid catalysts offer several advantages over homogeneous acid catalysts. They are easily removed from the reaction medium, and can be reused and avoid corrosion problems. However, the catalytic esterification is a reversible reaction between methanol and oleic acid with water as a by-product. The thermodynamic limitations in conventional reaction systems result in low conversions. Organic-inorganic pervaporation catalytic membranes combined solid catalysts with polymeric membranes have attracted most attention because there is the possibility of using the membrane reactors to increase conversion by simultaneously removing a reaction product in equilibrium-limited reactions [5–7]. For the reversible esterification between methanol and oleic acid, the byproduct water can be removed in time by means of pervaporation, thereby driving the reaction forward and increasing the yield. Besides, catalytic membranes, as one form of solid catalyst, could overcome the shortcomings of liquid catalyst and reduce the using amounts [8,9]. Moreover, the embedding of inorganic particles could enhance the thermal and mechanical properties of polymer membranes, which is helpful to keep the stability of membranes during esterification. These organic-inorganic pervaporation catalytic hybrid membranes can be obtained by blending hydrophilic polymers (such as Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)) with solid catalytic components, which combined the polymeric permselectivity for water with catalytic activity for esterification. For example, Shi et al. [7] prepared novel organic-inorganic hybrid membranes as heterogeneous acid catalyst for biodiesel production from zirconium sulfate (Zr(SO4)2) and sulfonated poly(vinyl alcohol) (SPVA). Esterification results showed that the conversions of free fatty acid (FFA) in acidified oil were 94.5% for Zr(SO4)2/SPVA catalytic membranes. Guerreiro et al. [10] dispersed hydrotalcite in PVA solution to prepare basic catalytic membranes for biodiesel synthesis by soybean oil methanolysis. These catalysts are more active in the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol than the free hydrotalcite and can be reused for several runs without any further reactivation. Besides, such catalytic membranes for esterification could be also fabricated by entrapping H3PW12O40 [11], ion exchange resin [12,13], et al. into PVA. In all, the low energy consumption and the possibility of carrying out the reaction without the use of solvents and thus render this catalytic membrane reactor process environmentally and technically more attractive. In our previous work [14], a kind of organic-inorganic composite polymerizable BrØnsted acidic ionic liquids solid catalysts (PAL-PILs) were fabricated via grafting polymerization of strong acid 1-butysulfonate-3-vinylimidazole hydrogen sulfate ionic liquids (PILs) onto nanofiber-like natural palygorskite (PAL). Obviously, in PILs chains, there is an acid active group in every monomer unit. The acidity density in PAL-PILs were very high, thereby resulting in high efficient catalytic properties. The key is that the PAL-PILs exhibited a good stability. After 6 recycling reaction, the activity of PAL-PILs was still maintained. More interestingly, the imidazolium based ILs shows a good affinity and compatibility with some polymers for membrane productions, such as PVA [15], cellulose [16], cellulose acetate propionate [17]. For example, Takegawa et al. [18] studied the composites of cellulose and PILs copolymers in detail. X-ray diffraction illustrated that the addition of the PILs to the cellulose disrupts its crystallinity, indicating a good compatibility between polymer and PILs. Besides, the various weight ratios of tested PILs influenced the mechanical properties of investigated composites due to the strong interactions among the active groups in PILs chains and polymer matrix. The increasing content of PIL is good for the increase of the stress value of the composites. Thus, the embedding of the above organic-inorganic composite catalysts (PAL-PILs) into PVA matrix could not only endow membranes with high catalytic properties but also enhance the membrane’s physical and chemical stability. In this work, we reported a water selective pervaporation catalytic membrane. The organic-inorganic hybrid membrane was prepared by blending PVA with PAL-PILs. The ethanol-water mixture was used to evaluate membrane performances. The use of catalytic active membranes and in particularly the use of catalytic membrane reactors for the reaction between methanol and oleic acid were further studied to design a new process for biodiesel synthesis."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA (the degree of polymerization 1750 ± 50) and succinic acid were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The pure PAL was supplied by Jiangsu Jiuchuan Nano-material Technology Co., Ltd. Methanol (≥99.5%) was purchased from Shanghai Shiyi Chemical reagent Co., Ltd., ethanol (≥99.7%), γ-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy silane (KH-570) and oleic acid (AR) from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, 1-butysulfonate-3-vinylimidazole hydrogensulfate ([(CH2)4SO3HVIm]HSO4) from ShangHai Cheng Jie Chemical Co., LTD and 2,2′-Azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) from Shanghai Chemical Co., Ltd."
3,Preparation of PAL-PILs,"2.2 Preparation of PAL-PILs The detailed preparation process has been described in our previous work [14,19]. Firstly, the activated PAL was modified with γ-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy silane (KH-570). Secondly, 2.0 g KH-570 modified PAL was mixed with 4 g ionic liquid monomers (CH2)4SO3HVIm]HSO4) and 0.26 g AIBN. The mixture was refluxed with mechanical agitation at 60 °C for 30 h under N2 atmosphere. Finally, the product was separated, rinsed, dried and ground into powder successively, marked as PAL-PILs."
4,Membrane preparation,"2.3 Membrane preparation At first, 10 g PVA was dissolved into 90 g deionized water at 90 °C under constant stirring for 2 h to obtain 10 wt% PVA solution. Secondly, 2 g succinic acid and different amount (0.5 g, 1 g, 2 g, 3 g) of PAL-PILs (PILs immobilization efficiency 41%) were added into the PVA solution successively. The mixture was stirred for 2 h at 90 °C to prepare a fine dispersed PAL-PILs dispersion. Thirdly, the mixture was cast onto glass plate and dried at 30 °C for 24 h to obtain CPVA/PAL-PILs membranes. At last, the membrane was peeled off from the glass plate and annealed at 80 °C for 0.5 h in a heating oven. The detailed conditions for different membranes is given in Table 1 ."
5,Membrane characterization,"2.4 Membrane characterization Attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectra (ATR-FTIR) were recorded on a Fourier Transform infrared Spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet is50) in the range of 4000–500 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and 256 scans to determine the chemical composition of the samples. Thermal stability was examined by a STA409PC Thermo gravimetric analyzer with a heating rate of 10 °C per minute under N2 atmosphere, and the temperature ranged from 25 °C to 800 °C. SEM images were performed on QUANTA FEG450 field emission scanning electronic microscope (FESEM) to observe the membrane structure and morphology. The mechanical properties of CPVA/PAL-PILs membranes were tested by Universal Testing Machine to evaluate the membrane mechanical properties. The samples with 8 mm width were placed between the grips of the machine with grip length of 5 cm. The hanging drop method (Drop Shape Analyzer, DSA, OSA200-T) was used to test the static contact angle of the membranes. The droplet volume was 2 µL. The tested results were obtained after 10 s."
6,Swelling measurements,"2.5 Swelling measurements The swelling experiments of membranes were conducted as follows [20]. Firstly, dry membrane, Wd, was weighed and then immersed in different concentration of water-ethanol mixtures at 30 °C for 5 h. After that, the swollen membranes were taken out and blotted carefully with filter paper to remove excess surface solution, and weighed Ws. The swelling degree of membrane was calculated by the following equation: (1) Swelling degree % = Ws - W d Wd × 100 % where Ws is the mass of the swollen membrane (g) and Wd is the mass of dry membrane (g)."
7,Pervaporation performances,"2.6 Pervaporation performances Dehydration experiments of ethanol were conducted to evaluate the separation performance of membranes. The membrane was sealed in the middle of module and effective membrane area was 24.6 cm2. Feed temperature was controlled by water bath and the feed mixture was pumped into the cell at a constant flow. Vacuum pump was applied to keep the permeate side at about 200 Pa. Permeate was collected in a cold-trap. The composition of permeate (ethanol) was analyzed using gas chromatograph (SP6800A, equipped with TCD detector, Porapak Q packed column). The column temperature was 150 °C; the injector and the detector temperatures were set at 150 °C and 160 °C. Hydrogen (purity ≥ 99.999%) was used as carrier gas at pressure of 0.2 MP and 1.0 µL injection volume. The total flux (J) and the separation factor (α) were calculated as follows: (2) J = M A × t (3) α = Y W / Y E X W / X E where W, A and t represent permeate weight (g), effective membrane area (m2) and operation time (h). Y and X are the mass fractions of water and ethanol in permeate and feed."
8,Catalytic experiments,"2.7 Catalytic experiments For the PAL-PILs, CPVA, CPVA/PAL-PILs in type of small segments and ILs homogeneous catalysts, the esterification of oleic acid and methanol were performed in a three-necked flask. The catalytic membrane was cut into pieces (0.7 g) and added into the flask. Desired amount of oleic acid and methanol was poured into the flask successively. The molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid was 10:1, the reaction temperature was 75 °C controlled by oil bath, the reaction time was 5–20 h. After reaction completed, the mixture was analyzed by gas chromatograph (SP6800A, equipped with FID detector) to determine biodiesel yield. The detailed analytic conditions of gas chromatograph for Methyl Oleate was described in detailed in our previous work [14]. The yield could be calculated in the following equation: (4) Y % = m 1 m 2 × 100 where Y% stands for the yield of methyl oleate, m 1 for the actual mass of methyl oleate, m 2 for the theoretical mass of methyl oleate. The performances of CPVA/PAL-PILs membranes were investigated using a catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) with recycle of permeate. As shown in Fig. 1 , pervaporation coupled esterification was performed in pervaporation module. The molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid was 10:1, feed temperature was 75 °C. Other operation conditions were the same as described in above dehydration experiment of ethanol."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Formation of catalytic membranes,"3.1 Formation of catalytic membranes The possible mechanism for formation of CPVA/PAL-PILs hybrid membrane is shown in Schemes 1 . Organic-inorganic PAL-PILs composite catalysts were successfully prepared by grafting polymerization of acid ionic liquids (ILs) (1-butysulfonate-3-vinylimidazole hydrogen sulfate) onto modified nanofiber-like natural palygorskite (PAL) supports in our previous work [14]. In preparing the hybrid membranes, PVA was cross-linked with succinic acid (SA) to prevent its leaching out and to maintain the membrane swelling. For crosslink reaction, the OH groups on PVA reacted with the COOH of SA generating the crosslink sites via the ester linkages. As shown in Fig. 2 , the FT-IR spectrum of CPVA exhibited the strong absorption band at 1695 cm−1 attributing to ester bonds. After blending with PAL-PILs, two new peaks appeared when compared with CPVA and CPVA/PAL membranes. Peaks appeared at 1041 cm−1 and 986 cm−1 were attributed to SO symmetric stretching vibration and SO stretching vibration of (CH2)4SO3H in PAL-PILs [14]. Meanwhile, the peak strengths increased with the adding amounts of PAL-PILs (from M1 to M5). Moreover, the residual OH groups on the surfaces of PAL-PILs could further react with the uncross-linked OH groups in PVA chains to form hydrogen bonds. This may be revealed by the movement of typical OH peak from 3450 cm−1 to 3267 cm−1 in Fig. 2. Thus, the adding of PAL-PILs can actas a cross-linker to enhance the stability and hydrophilicity of membranes. Besides, the flexible polymer chains (PILs) arising from PAL-PILs could also bridge between the PAL particles and PVA chain, which may improve the flexibility and toughness of the hybrid membranes (Scheme 1). Fig. 3 revealed that PAL-PILs nanofibers had a good compatibility with the PVA matrix with the addition of crosslinking agent. Characteristic peak at 19.9° was responded to the (1 0 1) plane of PVA in CPVA and the hybrid membranes. For PAL-PILs, peaks at 8.3°, 13.78°, 16.34°, 19.70° and 20.62° are attributed to the reflection of 110, 200, 130, 040 and 121 of PAL [21], respectively. After blending PAL-PILs with PVA, these typical peaks all appeared in the XRD patterns of the hybrid membranes (M1-M4), though the peaks at 19.9° became slightly weaker for M3. It is implied that the crystallinity and structure of PAL-PILs was maintained perfectly. In addition, from the XRD patterns of CPVA in Fig. 3, the strong peaks at 19.66° and the weak peaks at 11.76° and 22.71° are attributed to the crystal reflection of 101, 100 and 200 of PVA [22], respectively. After hybridization with PAL or Pal-PILs, the peak strength at 19.66° became weak and strong at 22.71°. It means that the addition of PAL or Pal-PILs disrupts the crystallinity and lattice size of PVA, indicating a good compatibility between PVA and PILs [18]."
11,Morphology of catalytic membranes,"3.2 Morphology of catalytic membranes The practical photos and SEM images are given in Fig. 4 . From the digital photos of different membranes, it can be seen that the membranes looked slightly opaque and a little rough after adding PAL or PAL-PILs, indicating that an even mixing and distribution was being achieved in membranes. From SEM images, it can be seen that the pure CPVA (Fig. 4a) membrane looked smooth. After adding PAL or PAL-PILs, the surface became relatively rough, and this phenomenon gradually became obvious with an increase in the content of PAL-PILs. Importantly, large amounts of PAL-PILs exposes to the outer surface. These natural nanofiber-like PALs own large BET surfaces and rich porous structures [23]. Thus, this special structures of PVA-PAL/PILs membrane surfaces may be expected to boost separation performance, because of lower mass transfer resistance and large contact area between catalyst and reactants [9]. Besides, Fig. 4(c–e) showed that PAL-PILs was uniformly dispersed in the PVA matrix, and presented a certain regularity due to sonication. Furthermore, no obvious interfacial defects were found in Fig. 4(c–e). However, at excessive content ratio, the filler particles tended to aggregate inevitably in the membrane matrix. Fig. 4f showed obvious PAL-PILs agglomeration in the PVA membrane surface, meanwhile, the PAL-PILs was not as evenly distributed. The key is that these stacking and agglomeration of nanofibers may cause the forming of interfacial voids between agglomeration and polymer matrix [24], which would be detrimental to the density and strength of hybrid membranes."
12,Thermal and mechanical properties of catalytic membranes,"3.3 Thermal and mechanical properties of catalytic membranes The thermal stability of hybrid membranes was investigated by TG and DSC in dynamic nitrogen atmosphere. TG curves of different membranes are illustrated in Fig. 5 . Clearly, the first weight losses occurring between 25 °C and 125 °C were due to the removal of adsorbed water molecules. The second weight losses starting from 200 °C and ending at 290 °C were attributed to the dehydroxylation between intra- or inter-chains of PVA [8]. When the temperature is higher than 300 °C, a sharp weight loss occurred, and the main chains of PVA polymer began to decompose at 350 °C. Moreover, it can be seen that the decomposition temperatures of CPVA/PAL-PILS hybrid membranes shifted to higher temperature regions and became blurred with the decrease of the content of PAL-PILs (from M4-M1), but all were higher than that of PVA membrane (M0), which suggested that there was some kind of bond formed between PVA and PVA-PILs and enhanced the thermal stability of hybrid membranes. The interaction between PVA and PVA-PILs were analyzed in above scheme 1. Meanwhile, from the DSC curves (Fig. 6 ), we could get that adding ATP-PILs change the melting behavior of membranes [25] and affect the final properties of hybrid membrane which was consistent with TG results. Fig. 7 shows the stress-strain behavior of CPVA/PAL-PILs hybrid membranes. The tensile strength increased when the weight content of PAL-PILs increased from 0% to 2%, and then decreased when the weight content of PAL-PILs was above 2%. The M3 hybrid membrane showed the highest tensile strength of 22.13 MPa. As shown in Scheme 1, these could be attributed to the tradeoff between the quantity of PAL particle and the intensity of interfacial interaction between PAL and PVA. As we know, the organic–inorganic hybrid structure depends on the polymer-particle and particle-particle interactions, an ideal particle surface interaction (e.g. promoted by Scheme 1) leads to ideal adhesion and dispersion, which in turn improves the mechanical properties [26]. Besides, from Fig. 3, XRD analysis indicates a good compatibility between PVA and PILs. This interactions among the active groups in PILs chains and polymer matrix could enhance the mechanical properties [18]. Conversely, as shown in Fig. 4 (f-M4), an excessive adding amount of PAL-PILs leads to undesirable aggregation and the void defects are more possibly created between inorganic particles, polymer and inorganic particles, thereby decreasing the membrane tensile strength."
13,Swelling of catalytic membranes,"3.4 Swelling of catalytic membranes The swelling behavior of a membrane reflects a capability of the membrane to specifically interact with the absorbed molecules. The swelling degrees of CPVA/PAL-PILs hybrid membranes in different ethanol-water mixture are depicted in Fig. 8 . As can be observed, the swelling degree of all membranes decreased with the rise of ethanol concentration. The swelling behavior indicated that all membranes were more affine to water. This is due primarily to the specific interactions between water molecules and the OH groups of PVA in the membranes. Upon introducing PAL-PILs to the PVA membrane, the hybrid membranes exhibited a slight increase in the water swelling (at 0.5 wt% PAL-PILs for M1) as revealed in Fig. 8 (M1). In our previous works [14,19], we have found that the PAL owned a very big specific area and large amounts of micro pores. Thus, it is possible that water molecules enter and retain in the residual PAL pores. However, the swelling of CPVA/PAL-PILs membranes declined for higher PAL-PILs loading (from M2 to M4). In fact, it is evident from above Scheme 1 that the PAL-PILs acts as the physical crosslink for the surrounding PVA polymer molecules, thereby restricting movement of polymer chains near the PAL-PILs particles. Similarly, this suppression of the membrane swelling also happened to the PVA-zeolite 4A hybrid membranes in Amnuaypanich et al. [27] and Moore et al.‘s works [28]. This is positive for the CPVA/PAL-PILs membranes to retain the stability in long-term running."
14,Separation performances of catalytic membranes,"3.5 Separation performances of catalytic membranes The total permeation flux and permselectivity of CPVA/PAL-PILs hybrid membranes are shown in Fig. 9 . Clearly, the total flux increased monotonously with the weight content of PAL-PILs increasing from 0 to 3%. However, the separation factor increased initially and decreased promptly when the weight content was higher than 1%. CPVA/PAL-PILs (M2) owned the highest separation factor of about 111 with a total flux of 397 g·m−2·h−1 for 80 wt% ethanol aqueous at 70 °C. For the increase of total fluxes, according to the above FT-IR, SEM and swelling analyses, the improvement in total flux may be attributed to the exposed nanofiber-like PAL (Fig. 4 SEM) to enhance the surface hydrophilicity. It can be proved from Fig. 10 . After adding PAL-PILs, the contact angle decreased from 47.7° for CPVA to 44.0° for CPVA/PAL-PILs (0.5%), and declined continuously when increased the content of PAL-PILs. For the separation factor, with the content of PAL-PILs increasing to 1 wt%, the permeation flux and separation factor of the membranes synchronously increased, which demonstrated obvious anti-tradeoff effect. This increase of separation factor was mainly attributed to the permeation selectivity for water that was offered by the exposed PAL with porous structures [23]. Besides, the flexible polymer chains (PILs) in PAL-PILs and the hydrogen bonds between the residual OH groups on the surfaces of PAL-PILs and OH groups in PVA chains could decrease the unselective interface pores in the hybrid membranes (Scheme 1) [29]. However, an excessive content ratio would tend to aggregate (Fig. 4), and may cause the forming of interfacial voids between agglomeration and polymer matrix [24]. Thus, when the weight content of PAL-PILs was more than 1%, the numbers of unselective interfacial voids increase greatly, thereby decreasing the separation factor significantly. Also, these voids can help to enhance the total flux. This is why the total flux increased more quickly when the content of PAL-PILs was higher than 1 wt%."
15,Catalytic properties of hybrid membranes,"3.6 Catalytic properties of hybrid membranes The new CPVA/PAL-PILs catalytic membranes were evaluated in the esterification reaction between oleic acid and methanol in a CMR at 75 °C. For comparison, the PAL-PILs, CPVA, CPVA/PAL-PILs in type of small segments and homogeneous ILs catalysts were also investigated under the same reaction conditions, respectively. The results (Fig. 11 ) show that the homogeneous ILs catalyst had the highest catalytic activity. After reaction 5 h, the yields of ester reached about 85% and 69% for PAL-PILs and homogeneous ILs catalysts. Compared with them, the yields of ester were very low for M2 and M3, only about 4.3% and 4.6% after reaction 20 h. These is mainly due to the low contents of PAL-PILs (PILs immobilization efficiency 41%) in the membranes, only from about 0.2–2% for M1-M4. Besides, some activity sites may be covered by the PVA or other foulants, limiting reactants diffusion within the membranes, especially given the membranes thickness obtained [12]. However, compared the pure CPVA, all CPVA/PAL-PILs membranes exhibited remarkably catalytic activities. Moreover, the yield of ester increased with the increasing of PAL-PILs contents (M1-M3) and decreased promptly when the weight content was higher than 2 wt% (M4). As shown in Fig. 4f, the decline of catalytic activity for M4 may be because of the evenly distribution and agglomerations, thereby not only reducing the activity sites but also decreasing the density and strength of hybrid membranes. Anyway, it is implied that the CPVA/PAL-PILs catalytic membranes preliminarily processed the catalytic capacity for the esterification between oleic acid and methanol. The insufficient catalysis was mainly due to the low content and inadequate contacts between the reactants and the immobilized PILs. Then, the CPVA/PAL-PILs membrane with an effective area of 24.6 cm2 was assembled in a module to setup a cross-flow catalytic membrane reactor (CMR, Fig. 1), which could increase conversion by simultaneously removing a reaction product in equilibrium-limited reactions. As shown in Fig. 12 , similarly with above results, the yields of ester increased with the reaction time and PAL-PILs contents. The yield values reached about 7.6% and 8.7% for M2 and M3 respectively, when the reaction time was prolonged over 20 h. Compared with the type of small segments, the yields increased by about 100%. Obviously, the CMR exhibited a much higher catalytic property. The change trends are consistent with the previous work [5–7,13]. For the reversible esterification between methanol and oleic acid, the byproduct water can be removed in time by means of pervaporation, thereby driving the reaction forward and increasing the yield. Meanwhile, a cross-flow operation could bring about an effective contact between the reactants and the immobilized PILs catalysts in the CMR. Moreover, the presence of channels in catalytic layer seems to lead to an improvement of reactants transport through the membrane yielding better catalytic results [9]. It can be proved from SEM images (Fig. 4). The exposing and embedding of PAL-PILs in PVA matrix made the membrane rougher, providing larger contact areas between catalyst and reactants. However, compared with the catalytic activities of ILs-functionalized PVA membranes (catalyst content 20 wt%) [9], the conversions of ester in this work were still very low. Note, importantly, the effective contact area was only about 24.6 cm2 in this work (only 0.2–2% PILs), and the yield can be improved by increasing packing density of CPVA/PAL-PILs. Thus, the results offer a great potentiality for these catalytic membranes in the CMR for further researches. However, attention must still be drawn to the incorporating dose rate and contacting area effect on catalytic activity, as well as to the improvement of membranes’ diffusional properties, which will be the focus of near work before the studies in pervaporation reactor."
16,Conclusions,"Poly (vinyl alcohol)(PVA) hybrid catalytic membranes were prepared successfully via blending PVA with solid catalyst (PAL-PILs), which was synthesized by grafting polymerization of acid ionic liquids (PILs) (1-butysulfonate-3-vinylimidazole hydrogen sulfate) onto natural nanofiber-like palygorskite (PAL) supports. The adding of PAL-PILs can enhance the thermal stability, mechanical strength and hydrophilicity of membranes. The flexible polymer chains (PILs) arising from PAL-PILs could bridge between the PAL particles and PVA chain. Meanwhile, the crystallinity and structure of PAL-PILs was maintained perfectly. Moreover, the hybrid catalytic membranes showed preference to water. CPVA/PAL-PILs (M2) had the highest separation factor of about 111 with a total flux of 397 g·m−2·h−1 for 80 wt% ethanol aqueous at 70 °C. The hybrid membrane exhibited an obvious catalytic performance for the esterification of oleic with methanol under mild reaction conditions. For the type of small segments, the yields of ester were only about 4.3% and 4.6% after reaction 20 h for M2 and M3. For the cross-flow CMR, the yield values reached about 7.6% and 8.7% for M2 and M3, respectively. Obviously, the CMR exhibited a much higher catalytic property. However, compared with the PAL-PILs and homogeneous ILs catalysts, the conversions of ester were still very low. Importantly, the yield can be improved by increasing packing density of CPVA/PAL-PILs membranes. Meanwhile, as an environment-friendly technology, the CMR does not require separation of catalysts and reduce the loss of catalysts significantly. The results offer a great potentiality for these catalytic membranes in the CMR for further research."
