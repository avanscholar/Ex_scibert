0,Introduction,"With the accentuating and rapid progress of technology and industries such as pharmaceutical, petrochemical, chemical manufacturing, refinery, and textile industries, different complicated organic compounds are produced as recalcitrant wastewaters [1]. Recalcitrant wastewaters, especially textile dyes and their derivatives are biologically resistant compounds and it's difficult to degrade or eliminate these compounds by using traditional approaches such as biological oxidative pathways [2,3]. Annually, the market of the dyes records up to (>7 × 105 tons per year) and about (>10%) of these amounts are injected into the surrounding environments through the industrial process [4]. Indeed, the synthetic dyes have aromatic backbones with a stable structure against oxidizing agents, heat, light and aerobic digestion. Also, they have a high resistance to degradation, which are not biodegradable and their polluting nature is considered as an environmental concern which needs effective methods to treat these dyes before being rejected to water bodies [3,5]. Besides the huge quantity of solids, heavy metals, surfactants, and chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons that exist in the textile dyes, wastewaters have also different side effects such as skin irritation, carcinogenic effects, toxic, and hazardous effects on human health [1,6] which all rise the problems of the required management practices [2,7,8]. So, the innovation/invention of materials with the ability to degrade and eliminate such dyes is extremely needed. As a result, many approaches were introduced to eliminate the organic pollutants in water [1–4]. However, these approaches such as coagulation, electrochemical oxidation, and others, cannot eliminate the contaminants thoroughly. This is due to their limitations such as they produce a large quantity of chemical sludge and they have low removal efficiency [1–4]. In addition, their shortcomings in large scale production thanks to their huge investment prices and capital running, so this drives the academics to explore new effective management approaches [1,9]. Adsorption technique has introduced as an efficient way to eliminate the dyes from the polluted water. In fact, the activated carbon adsorption was firstly introduced as a solution to remove the dyes, but these materials also have many shortcomings such as their expensive prices, economic burdens and their applications have been restricted by their lower selectivity towards dispersed vat dyes [10]. From these points, semi-conductor materials were introduced as a potential solution by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 to eliminate dyes from wastewater [11,12]. Then, many semi-conductor materials have been introduced by researchers and academics as adsorbents/catalysts [13]. Nowadays, researchers diagnose that adsorbent/catalysts with single semi-conductor display low catalytic/removal efficiency [14], and they exert great efforts to enhance it. So, composites based on semi-conductors, Au/CeO2, meso-CuFe2O4, CDs/BiVO4 QDs and others, are extensively employed and they show an amazing effect in catalysis/adsorption process [15,16]. But these semi-conductor composites have some difficulties in their preparation methods, creating secondary toxic fragments, huge operational and investment prices, weak stability against external mechanical and/or chemical tensors, high-energy requirements, environmental contaminations, and others [17]. Therefore scientific community is racing the time to improve these materials with such catalytic activity. So, the polymeric nano-composites have been introduced as adsorbents/catalysts to the process of water management [18], thanks to their pretty large pore volume, high surface area and brilliant adsorption behavior, which are coming from their micrometer-sized overall structure that combines the advantages of the polymer and the nano-fillers. Recently, polymeric/semi-conductor nano-composites have been applied for the elimination of various dyes from the polluted water. For example, PVA-TiO2-microfibrillated cellulose (PVA-TC) nano-composite has been used to reject methylene blue dye from the polluted water under the UV irradiation [19]. The removal efficiency of the dye by using this composite was about 91.45% within 10 min. Also, the polypyrrole/Zinc oxide (PPy/ZnO) nano-composite has been used to eliminate the brilliant green dye from the wastewater [20]. The removal efficiency of the dye by using this composite was about 95.5% within 90 min. In spite of the above works on removing the dyes from the wastewater, these composites have been limited by the low efficiency, consuming a large time, needed to high energy and their weak selectivity. So, the need for adsorbents with high efficiency and high selectivity is very urgent. From this point, we present in this simple effort a cheap and highly efficient adsorbent based on polyvinyl alcohol polymer doped with metal peroxide nano-particles with a high removal efficiency, high selectivity, high operational stability and high repeatability. In fact, PVA is considered the pioneer polymer when compared with the other polymers due to its excellent features and potential functional applications arising from its simple handling, environmental stability, cut-price, optical visibility and others [1–4,21–29]. Indeed, most reported literatures proved that PVA was able to adjust its structure, electrical, optical and electronic features after being doped with diverse nano-materials [1–4,21–29]. Alternatively, we are interested in metal peroxide (especially, magnesium peroxide MgO2) in nano-range, in this work. This is because it contains two oxygen atoms connected with one bond in its structure. Recently, the excess of oxygen, high oxidization potential and electro-negative behavior make these peroxides have brilliant features and promising applications [1–4]. Indeed, little works were reported on polymeric nano-composites based on PVA, metal peroxides and/or their composites for removing dye-stuff from wastewater. For example, El-Shamy and Zayied [4] reported on (CDots/PVA) structure for removing 30 mg/L of the methylene blue (MB) molecules with efficiency (97%) within 40 min. Also, the nano-rod structure of MgO2 has been designed for removing (30 mg/L) of methyl orange dye (MO) under the UV light with efficiency (97.4%) within 50 min [3]. In addition, CDots/ZnO2 photocatalysts were engineered to remove different (MO, MB and RhB) dyes. It was found that CDots/ZnO2 was able to eliminate Rhodamine B dyes in 80 min with an efficiency (99 ± 1%), methylene blue in 50 min with efficiency (99 ± 1%), and methyl orange in 60 min with efficiency (91 ± 2%) under the illumination of UV-A [1]. Also, under the UV light, ZnO2 was used to remove Rhodamine B molecules from the wastewater [30]. Furthermore, ZnO2 has been applied for removing the mustard gas [31]. Although all these works were introduced to remove the different dye stuff with a high efficiency and short time, but, there are many issues still obstructing the applications of these catalysts for example, attaining the selective adsorption is a very hard goal; their low adsorption capacities; and their low operational stability for a long time. Therefore, it is very interesting to achieve a catalyst/adsorbent with environmental friendly features, as well as being cheap, with high up-take capacity, high operational stability and high selectivity. So, to overcome the above problems, we offer a new adsorbent based on polyvinyl alcohol doped with magnesium peroxide (MgO2) polymeric nano-composite with high selective dyes, high uptake capacity, high operational stability, and high recyclability."
1,Experimental details,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA (M w = 17,000 g mol−1, hydrolysis degree HD~87–89%) was obtained from the Sigma–Aldrich Chemical Co., Magnesium acetate dehydrate (M w = 142.394 g mol−1, 99.9%), Hydrogen peroxide H2O2 (M w = 34.01 g mol−1, 99.8%), CH3CH2OH (ethanol, 99.5%) and Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH, 99.9%), Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 99.8%) were achieved from the local Co., (El-Nasr Chemicals, Egypt)."
3,Production of (PVA/MgO2) nanocomposite films,"2.2 Production of (PVA/MgO2) nanocomposite films Magnesium peroxide MgO2 particles have been created in nano-scale by using the hydrothermal approach [1–4], see supplementary materials S1. PVA films have been synthesized by using the casting approach [1–4,21–29], see supplementary materials S2. PVA/MgO2 nano-composite films have been synthesized by the casting approach [32–37] as follow: 0.02 g of MgO2 was liquefied in triple-distilled water and then added dropwise to the clear PVA solution, which is prepared by dissolving PVA (2 g) in the triple-distilled water (50 mL) at 60 ± 5 °C for 2 h. The solution is poured in a petri-dish and left in an oven at 40 °C for 24 h to evaporate the solvent."
4,Experimental methods,"2.3 Experimental methods The XRD patterns for the samples have been carried out at the room temperature by using diffractometer (Model: Brucker Axs-D8) with a monochromator of λ = 0.154 nm Cu Kα radiation from 5° to 80°. TEM microscope (JEOL-JEM-1230) was conducted to evaluate MgO2 particle size by dropping the as prepared MgO2 solution into a carbon-coated copper grid. Also, the ultra-microtome technique is applied to obtain a thin layer of the PVA/MgO2 film to evaluate the particle size of MgO2 after being embedded into PVA. Evaluation of the porosity and the surface area of the nano-composite has been done by using a BET apparatus, model: Micromeritics ASAP 2020, USA, under nitrogen environments. The morphology of PVA/MgO2 has been scanned by using FESEM, JEOL JSM- 6500F. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) technique, model HORIBA, Zeta sizer nano series, was used to measure the zeta potential (ζ) of PVA/MgO2 films. A double beam (JASCO V-570) spectrophotometer was conducted to measure the absorption spectra of PVA/MgO2 nano-composites as a function of λ (190–800 nm). FTIR (Nicolet DTGS TEC detector) apparatus was conducted to detect the vibrational modes of PVA/MgO2 in the range (4000–400 cm−1) at room temperature."
5,Adsorption studies,"2.4 Adsorption studies The experiment of dye removal was performed at ambient temperature. A solution of 50 mL of methylene blue dye with concentration (25 mg/L) was used in this experiment. Then the desired amount of (PVA/MgO2) adsorbent was injected into the above solution under mechanical stirring for a definite time. After that, (PVA/MgO2) adsorbent was removed/separated from the mixture by using a centrifuge apparatus (rotation rate 1000 round/minute). The amount of MB dye was calculated by using spectrophotometer at λ = 665 nm in a specific interval time. The amounts of MB uptake per unit mass of (PVA/MgO2) adsorbent at equilibrium, q e (mg/g), were calculated. Also, the amounts of MB uptake per unit mass of (PVA/MgO2) at time (t), q t (mg/g), were calculated from the equations [1–4]. (1) q e = ( C o − C ) e V W (2) q t = ( C o − C t ) V W where the amount of MB at the initial stage is denoted by C0 (mg/L), the amount of MB dye at time t is denoted by Ct (mg/L), the amount of MB at equilibrium stage is denoted by Ce (mg/L), PVA/MgO2 adsorbent weight is denoted by W (g) and the MB dye volume used in the experiment is denoted by V (L). The removal efficiency percentage (%) of MB dye and the uptake capacity of (PVA/MgO2) adsorbent were determined from the relations; (3) Removal % = C o - C t C o × 100 (4) Uptake Capacity = ( C o - C t ) V W × 100 In fact, all the parameters affected the removal efficiency of dyes by using the (PVA/MgO2) adsorbent, such as adsorbent dosage, pH, dye concentration and temperature, were extensively studied. The pH value in the experiment was changed from (3–12) by tuning the HCl and/or NaOH. The experiments were performed many times for obtaining the average values and the standard deviation."
6,Selective adsorption experiment,"2.5 Selective adsorption experiment A mixture of different (MB + MO) dyes has been used for the adsorption selective process of the (PVA/MgO2) adsorbent. In fact, 30 mg of (PVA/MgO2) adsorbent was inserted into the mixture of dyes at ambient temperature. 25 mg/L was the initial concentration of both MO and MB dyes. The amount of residual MB was calculated by using the spectrophotometer."
7,Reusability test,"2.6 Reusability test The test of PVA/MgO2 adsorbent reusability was performed as a follow: when the adsorption process was completed, the PVA/MgO2 adsorbent was collected and rinsed with water to be ready for the new adsorption-desorption experiment. In fact, the catalyst was immersed into 30 mL of HCl acid solution for regeneration before using it in the new adsorption-desorption experiment. Then this procedure was repeated under the same conditions for ten cycles. 50 mL of MB solution (25 mg/L), 30 mg of PVA/MgO2 and pH~12 were the experimental conditions."
8,Water resistance properties,"2.7 Water resistance properties The swelling degree S.D (%) and the weight loss W.L (%) of PVA and PVA/MgO2 adsorbent were evaluated as [1–4]: At first, (30 mg) of dry PVA and PVA/MgO2 adsorbent was weighed (Wd) and then immersed at ambient temperature in triple-distilled for 24 h. After that, they were weighed (Ws) after being wiped with tissue paper to eliminate the excess of H2O molecules from the swollen adsorbent surface. Then, at 40 °C, the PVA and PVA/MgO2 adsorbent were dried for 12 h and weighed (Wa) after finishing the test of water dipping. The swelling degree S.D (%) of PVA and PVA/MgO2 adsorbent was evaluated from: (5) Swelling degree S . D ( % ) = ( W s - W d ) W s Also, the weight loss W.L (%) of PVA and PVA/MgO2 adsorbent was evaluated from, (6) Weight loss W . L ( % ) = ( W d - W a ) W d"
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterization of PVA/MgO2 nanocomposite,"3.1 Characterization of PVA/MgO2 nanocomposite In this study, we present an out-price and novel PVA/MgO2 adsorbent prepared by the casting technique for high selecting methylene blue dye from the mixture of methylene blue and methyl orange solutions. In fact, the PVA has been selected in this work because of (i) its structure has the (OH) groups which facilitate the interaction with MgO2 and increase the (inter and intramolecular hydrogen bonding) in the adsorbent. In fact, this leads to enhancing the swelling features, enhancing the crystallinity of the adsorbent, improving the pore volume and size; and hence enhancing the adsorption capacity. (ii) PVA will interact with MgO2 producing an increase in the hydrogen bonding which improves the bending of dye molecules on the adsorbent surface, in fact, this leads to enhancing the specific surface area, and thus improving the adsorption process. (iii) The (-OH) groups on PVA surface can be ionized at basic nature (pH = 12) producing –ve PVA/MgO2 adsorbent which can electrostatically interact with the +ve MB dye and increase the removal efficiency (%). On the other hand, the causes behind the selection of MgO2 in this study are (i) the excess of oxygen, high electronegative features, and the large oxidization potential which lead to increasing the negative charge surface of the produced adsorbent and hence improving the dye selective adsorption performance. (ii) The presence of MgO2 in the nano-composite catalyst leads to increasing the reaction species and adsorption sites on the adsorption surface for adsorbing methylene blue dye. In fact, the author expected the interaction between PVA and MgO2 is reflected in the morphology, structure, crystallinity, surface charges and adsorption properties of the produced nanocomposites. So, to confirm these interactions and study the impact of MgO2 nanoparticles on the morphological, structural features and properties of the nanocomposite, the TEM, SEM, BET and XRD analyses of the nanocomposite were carried out. XRD patterns were performed for PVA and PVA/MgO2 nanocomposite films (Fig. 1 ). A peak at 2θ = 19.5° was observed for the PVA sample, which is produced from the strong inter/intramolecular H-bonding between the segments of PVA [1–4,21–29]. Beside this peak, there are more distinct peaks for PVA/MgO2 films were observed at 2θ = 37.1°, 45.3°, 53.6° and 63.2° for the (hkl) planes (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1), respectively. These peaks are due to the reflection planes of MgO2 nano-particles (JCPDS Card No. 78–0430, MgO2) [3]. The crystallinity was evaluated by using the ratio of the integrated area under the crystalline areas to the integrated areas of the whole XRD pattern [1,2]. As shown, the crystallinity of PVA/MgO2 nano-composite increases form (44.53%) for PVA to (49.44%) for the nano-composite, this is due to the increase in the number of hydrogen bonding between PVA and MgO2. In fact, the increase in the H-bonding leads to more adsorption uptake capacity and hence, high removal efficiency [2–4], where H-bonding is an important factor for binding the dye molecule with the adsorbents [2–4]. Also, to confirm the presence of MgO2 particles in the nano-composite, TEM microscope was used (Fig. 2 a and b). Fig. 2a shows the TEM image of the as prepared MgO2 powder. MgO2 particle has a uniform and regular spherical shape. MgO2 particle sizes vary from 10 to 70 nm with a mean size about 40.5 ± 3 nm (inset of Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b shows the TEM image for a thin layer of PVA/MgO2 films obtained by using ultra-microtome technique to study the particle size of MgO2 after embedding into the polymer matrix. As shown, MgO2 nanoparticles have a regular and spherical shape. Also, they are distributed in a good manner inside the PVA matrix. Their average sizes are 42 ± 1 nm (inset of Fig. 2b), as seen, there is no obvious change in the MgO2 size before and after embedding into PVA which reveals that the strong interaction between PVA and MgO2 and a strong adhesion of PVA chains on the MgO2. Also, the surface morphology of the films was analyzed by SEM microscope (Fig. 2c and d). Fig. 2c shows the SEM image of the as prepared MgO2 nanoparticle powder. As seen, the image shows a good distribution of MgO2 without any agglomeration. This means the success of the hydrothermal approach to synthesis the MgO2 nanoparticles with size less than 100 nm. On the other hand, MgO2 particles are distributed in the matrix of PVA uniformly with high densities (Fig. 2d). This manner of distribution allows avoiding the agglomeration of MgO2 in the polymeric template, and increasing the surface area, which gives this material the advantage to be a good adsorbent/catalyst. Besides that, the SEM image of the PVA/MgO2 shows some voids structure, which helps in increasing the adsorption uptake capacity of this adsorbent. The EDS spectra of PVA/MgO2 film were achieved to study the element compositions (Fig. 2e). Three spectra were detected at energies 0.2, 0.5 and 1.2 KeV for carbon, oxygen and magnesium, respectively, which confirm the elements in the nano-composite."
11,N2 adsorption-desorption study,"3.2 N2 adsorption-desorption study Under a stream of nitrogen (N2), the adsorption-desorption analysis of PVA/MgO2 nano-composite was performed (Fig. 2f). Fig. 2f reveals that PVA/MgO2 has the isotherm type (type IV) of mesoporous structure which shows an obvious hysteresis loop H3. PVA/MgO2 has a surface area 59.130 m2 g−1. Also, it can be seen that the average pore diameter of PVA/MgO2 is in between 2 and 50 nm. The pore radius was found 1.92 nm and the pore volume was found 0.191 cm3/g, (inset of Fig. 2f). Therefore, the obtained results reveal that the nano-composite has meso-porous structures [1–4]. This structure leads to improving the adsorption capacity of catalyst. Also, the high surface area and meso-porous structures enhance the MB adsorption. In general, the pores act as channels for adsorbing MB molecules."
12,Water resistance properties,"3.3 Water resistance properties The water uptake performance of the PVA and PVA/MgO2 films was carried out by using the test of water dipping in order to study the weight loss W.L (%) and the swelling degree S.D (%) [2,27] (Fig. 3 a and b). As detected, the S.D (%) value of PVA is higher than the PVA/MgO2 adsorbents (Fig. 3a). The presence of the (- OH) groups in the PVA backbone is the direct reason behind the PVA hydrophilic nature. In fact the (-OH) groups of PVA react spontaneously with H2O and produce H-bonding with H2O, hence creating a large S.D (%) value. However, when the MgO2 nanoparticles are embedded into the PVA polymer, a strong interaction between MgO2 and PVA is produced and this leads to consuming the (-OH) groups of PVA during this interaction, therefore the PVA is not able to generate H-bonding with H2O, as a result of creating a small S.D (%) value [1]. Also, the presence of MgO2 in PVA leads to increasing the rigidification of the PVA/MgO2 adsorbent, deterioration of the chain mobility and the free volume of PVA. To be more accurate, the interaction between the PVA and MgO2 produces an efficient H-bonding that leads to decreasing the hydrophilicity of PVA. Accordingly, PVA was not able to create H-bonding with H2O thus deteriorating the S.D (%) value of PVA/MgO2 adsorbent [4]. In addition to, the W.L (%) value of the PVA and PVA/MgO2 films was evaluated (Fig. 3b). As detected, the W.L (%) value of the PVA/MgO2 adsorbent is ~ 0%. This indicates that the PVA/MgO2 adsorbent is water insoluble and this adsorbent can be functionalized in the applications based on water."
13,Optical spectra,"3.4 Optical spectra The absorption spectrum for the PVA and PVA/MgO2 composite films has been measured (Fig. 3c). As seen, three peaks have been recorded for PVA in the range (190–400 nm). These peaks are located at λ = 200 nm, 275 nm and 325 nm, respectively. The n–π* transition was shown at λ = 200 nm thanks to the unsaturated bonds (CC and/or CO) in PVA and the π–π* transition was shown at λ = 275 nm and 325 nm, which arises from the charge transfer complexs (CTCs) in PVA [1–4,21–29]. However, no absorption peaks were detected in the visible region for PVA thanks to its high transparency. The impact of MgO2 nano-particles on the absorption spectra is clearly shown, as seen, the increase in the intensity of these peaks was observed with embedding MgO2 into PVA (Fig. 3c). In fact, the Beer's law can illustrate this behavior [2,4,21–29]. When embedding MgO2 into PVA, the absorption increases thanks to the growth in the numbers of the absorbing molecules. However, in the visible region (ca. λ = 500 nm) the absorption intensity increases with the presence of MgO2 in PVA matrix. Fig. 3d shows the plot of (αhν)0.5 and photon energy (hν) to obtain the energy gap of the nano-composites [1–4,21–29]. The energy gap for PVA was determined and it was found to be 4.94 eV. The value of the energy gap decreases with embedding MgO2 into PVA matrix to be 2.29 eV. This is thanks to the formation of the charge transfer complexes (CTCs) inside the PVA trap levels between HOMO and LUMO bands when embedding MgO2 into PVA [1–4,21–29]. In fact, the adsorbent with lower energy gap has an advantage in facilitating the charge transfer complexs with the dye molecules."
14,Adsorption study,"3.5 Adsorption study 3.5.1 Selective adsorption and selective mechanism One of the most important benefits of the adsorbent materials is the selectivity. The selectivity is very vital for adsorbents in targeting pollutants in water treatment which usually has a large amount of hazardous ingredients. In fact, the structure/morphology of the adsorbent surface is very important for selective adsorption, and it is also considered a significant parameter in adjusting the selectivity of adsorption. It is known that, a good adsorbent has the ability to extract or remove a definite dye from a mixture solution containing different dyes. This leads to saving more time, more accuracy, targeting the goal, economical and other benefits [38]. At first, we study the impact of pH value on the selective adsorption performance of the PVA/MgO2 to understand the selective adsorption mechanism. Fig. 4 a–c shows the absorption spectra of a solution mixture of (MO + MB) dyes before and after adsorption process. In this experiment, the mixture solution was formed from an equimolar of both MO and MB dyes that mixed with each other at temperature = 30 °C with changing the (pH = 1, 7 and 12). As seen, in the case of low pH = 1 (high acidity medium), the fingerprint peak of MO reduced with about 23% after adsorption, however, the fingerprint peak of MB still without change (Fig. 4a). Also, with changing the pH to 7, it was observed that the fingerprint peak for MB reduced with about 30% after adsorption, and the MO peak is not changed (Fig. 4b). More importantly, when increasing the pH to 12, the fingerprint peak for MB decreased with about 100% and completely disappeared after adsorption and the MO peak is still without change (Fig. 4c). It can be concluded that, the absorption spectra were changed with varying the pH value from acidic to basic environs. Also, this behavior indicates that the PA/MgO2 adsorbents have the ability to remove the MB dyes completely from the (MO + MB) mixture solution at pH = 12. On the other hand, we study the selective adsorption of PVA/MgO2 adsorbent at pH = 12 at different times. In this experiment, the mixture solution was formed from an equimolar of both MO and MB dyes that mixed with each other at the pH value = 12 and temperature = 30 °C. The selective experiments were carried out and depicted in Fig. 4d. It is clear that, there is no obvious change in the peak intensity at λ = 463 nm which is related to MO dye with the time, however, the peak intensity of MB dye at λ = 665 nm is remarkably decreased after the exposure of the solution to PVA/MgO2 adsorbent for 15 min. This proves the high selectivity of PVA/MgO2 adsorbent for MB dye removal. This is attributed to the electrostatic force (attractive electrostatic force) between + ve charged MB dye and –ve charged PVA/MgO2. In fact, MB molecules as a cationic dye were adsorbed on –ve charged PVA/MgO2 surface while MO molecules as anionic dye were still without adsorption. This discussion was confirmed with the measuring of the zeta (ζ)-potential/surface charge of PVA/MgO2 nano-composite at different pH environments (Fig. 5 a). Then we discussed the influence of pH values on the adsorption mechanism of the dyes. One of the most important factors in studying the adsorption experiments is the surface charge or Zeta (ζ)-potential, which can significantly influence on the stability of the particles in suspension during the electrostatic interaction between particles. Fig. 5a shows the value of zeta potential of PVA/MgO2 nano-composite at different (pH = 1–12). As shown, the negative surface charge of the adsorbent increased with increasing the pH values and the point of zero charge was recorded at pH = 6.4. As seen, the Zeta (ζ)-potential/surface charge of the PVA/MgO2 nano-composite is −9.9 mV at pH = 7 (Fig. 5b), this high negative value may be ascribed to the high electronegative performance of MgO2 nanoparticles and the (OH) groups of PVA. However, the negative surface charge of the nanocomposite increases to be −36.4 mV at pH~12 (Fig. 5c). In fact, this high negative surface charge value has a strong effect on the selective adsorption of MB dyes. In fact, the main adsorption mechanism is based on the electrostatic interaction between the dyes and the adsorbent. Obviously, the adsorbent gains + ve charge on its surface at pH = 1, which is electrostatically repulsive with MB dyes and can interact with MO with an attractive force. However, the adsorbent cannot be able to remove MO dyes completely from the solution, this is may be attributed to the MgO2 is not stable in the high acidic medium (MgO2 dissolution) [1–4]. On the other hand at pH = 12, the electrostatic interactions between MB dye (+ve charged) and PVA/MgO2 (-ve charged) increased, where the (-OH) groups on PVA surface were ionized at basic nature (pH = 12) producing –ve PVA/MgO2 adsorbent which can electrostatically interact with +ve MB dye and increase the removal efficiency (%). In fact, the adsorption mechanism is illustrated as a follow (Scheme 1 ). (i) The electrostatic attractive interaction between the ionized (-OH) groups of PVA and nitrogen of MB dyes (ii) The electrostatic attractive interaction between the partially –ve charged MgO2 and the partially + ve nitrogen in MB dyes. (iii) In addition, the interaction of hydrogen bonding type between the residual (-OH) groups of PVA that is not ionized and nitrogen atoms of MB dyes. More confirmation, the FTIR spectrum of PVA/MgO2 was compared before and after adsorption of MB dyes (MB@PVA/MgO2) (Fig. 6 ). In fact, the FTIR peaks of the MB dyes from 1300 to 1710 cm−1 are matched with Ref. [6]. As seen, the MB dyes exhibited a band at 1710 cm−1 for the CN + (CH3)2 groups. After the adsorption of MB dye on the PVA/MgO2, the peak at 1710 cm−1 for CN + (CH3)2 groups of MB dyes appeared in the MB@PVA/MgO2 proving the adsorption of MB on the PVA/MgO2 due to the electrostatic interaction between PVA/MgO2 and methylene blue dyes. Also, the peak at 3660 cm−1 for (-OH) of PVA/MgO2 shifted to 3422 cm−1 in MB@PVA/MgO2, which shows the contribution of hydrogen bonding interactions between (PVA, –OH groups) and MB dyes in the adsorption process. Moreover, the peak at 451 cm−1 for O–Mg–O in the PVA/MgO2 shifted to high frequency 648 cm−1 in MB@PVA/MgO2 proving the electrostatic interaction between the MgO2 and the MB dyes. These results confirm that the adsorption mechanism of MB dyes on PVA/MgO2 took place through both hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. 3.5.2 Study the MB adsorption process on PVA/MgO2 3.5.2.1 Effect of adsorbent dosage In the adsorption experiment, it's very vital to study and evaluate the dosage of adsorbent. Usually, the removal efficiency (%) of dyes increases with the growth of the dosage of the adsorbent and this increase is attributed to the increase in the available adsorption sites [1–4]. Fig. 7 a shows the impact of the adsorbent dosage (10, 20, 30 and 40 mg) of PVA/MgO2 nano-composites on the removal efficiency (%) of MB dyes. As seen, all the applied dosages of PVA/MgO2 adsorbent show a high removal efficiency ˃60% in a short time (15 min). However, the dosage (30 mg) of PVA/MgO2 adsorbent exhibits the largest removal efficiency (%) ~ 99.9 ± 0.1%. This is due to the growth in the numbers of adsorption sites [1–4]. It is clear that, beyond this dosage (30 mg) the removal efficiency (%) decreased, ca. 40 mg of adsorbent, and this is attributed to the concentration gradient between PVA/MgO2 and the methylene blue dye [39]. From this study, it is worthy to mention that the optimum dosage of the adsorbent was fixed to be 30 mg of PVA/MgO2. 3.5.2.2 Effect of pH value Another vital parameter affecting the performance of the MB adsorption process is the pH value. In fact, the surface charge of the adsorbent can be influenced by the alteration of the pH value which has an effect on the efficiency of adsorption. Actually, the change in the pH value of the solution produces a change in the surface features of the adsorbent and the ionization degree of dye molecules [1–4,39]. The impact of pH value on the removal efficiency (%) was examined and depicted in (Fig. 7b). The conditions of this experiment were 25 mg/L of MB dye, 30 mg of PVA/MgO2 and temperature 30 °C where the pH values were changed as a follow: pH = 3, 6, 9 and 12. From the figure, it was observed that when the pH = 12, the removal efficiency increased in a very short time (from 78.14 ± 1.9% at pH = 3 to 99.9 ± 0.1% at pH = 12). This increase can be attributed to the electrostatic interactions between MB dye (+ve charged) and PVA/MgO2 (–ve charged), where the (-OH) groups on PVA surface were ionized at basic nature (pH = 12) producing –ve PVA/MgO2 adsorbent which can electrostatically interact with +ve MB dye and increase the removal efficiency (%). Also, the lower removal efficiency (%) in the acidic nature can be attributed to the competition between the excess of hydrogen ions (H+) and the +ve charged MB dye for PVA/MgO2 adsorption sites. In addition, in acidic medium, PVA/MgO2 (with +ve charge on its surface) and +ve charged MB dye are electrostatically repulsive. This repulsive interaction leads to decreasing the removal efficiency of MB dye [1–4,40]. So, the pH = 12 is the optimum condition and it was fixed during all the experiments. 3.5.2.3 Impact of dye concentrations The impact of the initial dye concentrations on the removal efficiency (%) was examined (Fig. 7c). In the experiment, MB concentration was changed from 5, 10, 15, 20, to 25 mg/L. From the figure, it is clear that the removal efficiency depends on instantaneous relation between the adsorption sites available on the surface of the adsorbent and the concentration of dye. As detected, the removal efficiency (%) rises gradually with growing the MB concentration. This is attributed to the high MB concentration producing a great driving force for mass transfer [40]. 3.5.2.4 Adsorption isotherm The importance of studying the adsorption isotherm lies in how the adsorbent interacts with the dye. So, to design and operate the adsorption system, it is essential to correlate the equilibrium data with either an experimental or theoretical equations. The models of Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms have been applied to estimate the adsorption data for the dye. In fact, the linear forms of Langmuir isotherm is stated as (7) C e q e = 1 K L q m a x + 1 q m a x C e where MB concentration at equilibrium is defined by Ce (mg/L), maximum capacity of adsorption is defined by qmax (mg/L), adsorbed amount of MB per gram of (PVA/MgO2) is defined by qe (mg/g), and KL (L/mg) denotes to the adsorption energy. By applying this equation, the values of qmax and KL were obtained from the plot of Ce/qe versus Ce (Fig. 7d) and tabulated in Table 1 . The adsorption energy throughout the adsorbent surface is uniform; this assumption was claimed by Langmuir isotherm. On the other hand, Freundlich isotherm in linearized form is stated from (8) log q e = log K F + 1 n log C e KF is Freundlich constant and n is a constant represents a dimensionless heterogeneity factor which is linked to the adsorption capacity [1–4,39,40]. By applying this equation, the values of (kF and n) are evaluated from the plot of log qe versus log Ce (Fig. 7e). The Freundlich model indicates that the surfaces are with a highly heterogeneous nature and have an exponential distribution of energies and adsorption sites. Fig. 7d shows that the Langmuir model is highly fitted with the experimental data of MB adsorption in 15 min. This recommends that the Langmuir isotherm is more suitable for removing MB dye by using PVA/MgO2 adsorbent with R2 ~ 0.9985, where R2 is a regression coefficient value. In fact, the adsorption of MB dye on the PVA/MgO2 is accompanied with the creation of MB monolayer on the PVA/MgO2 surfaces thanks to the Langmuir isotherm. Moreover, the morphology of adsorbent surfaces displays a homogenous behavior with limited numbers of adsorption sites. Indeed, the Langmuir constant kL is associated to the energy contributed in the adsorption. Also, the kL constant was determined and it was found about ~0.031 (L/mg), this large value of kL refers to a large attractive force between the adsorption sites on the surface of PVA/MgO2 and the molecules of MB. It is important to mention that, the PVA/MgO2 adsorbent exhibits a high adsorption capacity qmax~274.7 mg/g. On the other hand, the pure PVA displays adsorption capacity qmax ~ 21.2 mg/g. As seen the enhancement in the adsorption capacity can be attributed to the improvement of crystallinity from 44.53% for PVA to 49.44% for PVA/MgO2. Where the interaction of PVA with MgO2 leads to increasing the crystallinity through increasing the hydrogen bonding during the creation of PVA/MgO2 film which improves the bending of dye molecules on the adsorbent surface, enhances the specific surface area, improves the pore volume and size and hence improving the adsorption capacity. 3.5.2.5 Kinetics of adsorption To determine the rate of MB adsorption by PVA/MgO2 at different time intervals, the kinetic mechanisms (Pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order kinetic models) were used (Fig. 8 a and b). In fact, the Pseudo first-order kinetics can be obtained from, (9) log ( q e − q t ) = − K 1 2.303 t + l o g q e where the rate constant of the first-order kinetic is denoted by k1 (min−1), MB amount adsorbed at equilibrium is denoted by qe (mg/g) and the adsorbed amount of MB at time t is denoted by qt (mg/g). Alternatively, the Pseudo second-order kinetics can be obtained from, (10) t q t = 1 K 2 q e 2 + t q e A straight line relation refers to the suitable kinetic model. This indicates that the most appropriate kinetic model for removing MB by PVA/MgO2 is the pseudo-second-order with R2 ~ 0.9995. Indeed, the pseudo-second order assumes that the process of adsorption is tuned by the rate-limiting steps of chemisorption interactions [1–4,41]. It is assumed that the valence force is participating in this case, due to exchanging or sharing of electrons between PVA/MgO2 and the MB molecules [42]. Also, the mechanism of adsorption depends on the concentration of adsorbent and adsorbate, according to this kinetic model [43]. 3.5.2.6 Effect of temperature It is known that, temperature has a strong effect on the adsorption process. So, the impact of temperature on the adsorption process was studied (Fig. 8c). As seen, the removal efficiency decreased with increasing the temperature from 27 to 70 °C. The removal efficiency was recorded (99.9 ± 0.1%) for 27 °C and (54.82 ± 2.5%) for 70 °C. These results denote that the thermodynamic process of this adsorption is exothermic. This is attributed to the increase in temperature leads to declining the adsorptive forces between the active sites on PVA/MgO2 surface and MB radicals [1–4]. In spite of the strong effect of the temperature on the removal efficiency, the nanocomposite is still working at higher temperature with an efficiency >50% at 70 °C. These results give this adsorbent an advantageous to be a good catalyst. 3.5.2.7 Effect of ionic strength on adsorption In general, many industries leave heavy metal wastewaters, which have many sorts of salts. In fact, the removal efficiency (%) is strongly affected by the ion of salts (high ionic strength) existing in the solutions during the adsorption. Thus, the impact of the ionic strength (Zn2+and Na+) on the removal efficiency (%) of MB dye was studied (Fig. 8d). The sources of the used ionic salts are sodium chloride and zinc chloride. It is worth to mention that Zn2+ has a strong effect on the removal efficiency (%), however, both the metal ions (Na+ and Zn2+) can inhibit the adsorption of MB and reduce the removal efficiency (%). On one side, the growth of (Na+ and Zn2+) concentrations leads to a considerably reduction in the MB dye solubility, which produces a decrease in the removal efficiency [2,4]. On the other side, unlike Zn2+, a little impact was produced on the swelling behavior of PVA/MgO2 when a definite quantity of Na+ was introduced into the ionic solutions. As a result, the molecules of MB dyes have a great difficulty to enter the core of PVA/MgO2 in the presence of Zn2+ as compared with Na+. In fact, the surface charge neutralization of the PVA/MgO2 by introducing the ions of the electrolyte is the cause behind the reduction in the removal efficiency (%), where the ions of electrolyte compete with the molecules of the MB dye for adsorbing on the adsorbent surface. It can be observed that, the reduction in removal efficiency (%) is not very high. This demonstrates that PVA/MgO2 can successfully eliminate MB dye even in the presence of high amount of salt."
15,Reusability of adsorbent,"3.6 Reusability of adsorbent Besides the high selectivity of the ideal adsorbent, it should have good reusability which can specify the adsorbent in industrial sectors. This is because of the usage of the adsorbent for longer time periods leads to a significant reduction in the total cost of the process which is considered as a great benefit. The experiment of regeneration was performed by soaking the MB-loaded PVA/MgO2 in a solution of 0.1 M HCl and then centrifuged for 60 min. After desorption, the regenerating PVA/MgO2 adsorbents were recycled for a new dye uptake process. As observed, the efficiency of MB desorbed from PVA/MgO2 adsorbents was 88 ± 1% (Fig. 8e). The obtained results confirmed the strong interactions between the adsorbent surfaces and the dye molecules [1–4]. The reuse experiment of PVA/MgO2 adsorbent was performed for removing MB dyes (Fig. 8f). As seen, for along ten runs of desorption−adsorption, the efficiency of 30 mg of PVA/MgO2 adsorbent for removing of (25 mg/L of MB dye) remained constant without change. To be more accurate 2% loss of the efficiency was observed after the 10th cycle. These results indicate that PVA/MgO2 adsorbent shows a good activity, high stability for long-time of reusing, and cost-efficiency which gives this adsorbent potential application in practical wastewater treatment. Table 2 shows the results of elimination of methylene blue in the present study and the other reported studies. As seen, 30 mg of PVA/MgO2 catalyst is able to eliminate 50 mL of 25 mg/L of methylene blue dye solution with efficiency (99.9 ± 0.1) within 15 min. This indicates that PVA/MgO2 has catalytic efficiency higher than that reported in previous literatures. The higher removal efficiency of our adsorbent PVA/MgO2 can be attributed to (1) the unique structures (combination between micro and nano scales) produced in the nano-composite by PVA matrix and MgO2. This structure enables the adsorption of the MB and facilitates the easy contact of dyes with MgO2. (2) The presence of MgO2 in the nano-composite catalyst leads to increasing the reaction species and adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface for adsorbing methylene blue dye. (3) The large pore volumes and surface area are playing together to increase the uptake capacity and increase the removal efficiency. (4) The high negative surface charge of PVA/MgO2 nano-composite leads to increasing the adsorption uptake capacity and enhancing the selective performance. In fact, the concentration of the catalyst used in this study is large as compared with the dyes concentration. However, from the analogue in (Table 2), the concentration used in our study is suitable and acceptable. In fact, the ideal catalyst must be able to eliminate a large volume of the dyes or huge dyes concentration; as clear, our PVA/MgO2 catalyst has the ability to reject a large volume (50 mL) of the MB when compared with the other adsorbents."
16,Conclusion(s),"The casting approach has been applied to create PVA/MgO2 films for selecting and removing MB dyes for the first time. XRD and TEM results confirmed the creation of MgO2 nano-particles with an average diameter of 40 ± 3 nm. The structure and the surface area of PVA/MgO2 adsorbent improved with the presence of MgO2 in the nano-composite. PVA/MgO2 showed a high specific surface area 59.130 m2/g and a high pore volume 0.191 cm3/g, which are useful for improving the adsorption capacity/efficiency. PVA/MgO2 has a high selective adsorption behavior for the MB dye due to its high negative surface charge (−36.4 mV), which enables the strong electrostatic interaction between the absorbent and +ve charged MB dyes. 30 mg of PVA/MgO2 catalysts showed a complete removal of 50 mL of 25 mg/L of methylene blue dye solution in a short time (15 min) with high removal efficiency (99.9 ± 0.1%). The Langmuir model was the isotherm model and the pseudo second order was the adsorption kinetics. Exothermic process was the thermodynamic process of this adsorption. Recycling experiments proved that PVA/MgO2 nano-composite can be used for ten cycles of methylene blue adsorption with 2% loss of its efficiency at the 10th cycle. This effort offers a novel approach for the construction of superior catalysts based on polymeric-metal peroxides structures. Finally, this work may give the green light to a wide range of potential functional applications for catalysis, water treatment and desalination technology."
