0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes without a bulky substituent on the CC group to unsaturated alcohols on heterogeneous catalysts remains a great challenge due to the thermodynamic and kinetic limitations. On the one hand, the free reaction enthalpy for the hydrogenation of the CC bond is about 35kJmol−1 more negative than that of the CO bond. On the other hand, it has long been believed that the activation energy for the hydrogenation of the CC bond is also lower than that of the CO bond [1–3]. More recently, based on DFT calculations of the hydrogenation pathways of acrolein on Pt(111) surface, Loffreda et al. proposed that the desorption step of the semihydrogenated product (unsaturated alcohol vs. unsaturated aldehyde) may play a key role for the selectivity [4,5]. Nevertheless, on most group VIII metal-based hydrogenation catalysts, α,β-unsaturated aldehydes are hydrogenated predominantly to unsaturated aldehydes [1–3,6]. Although Au is rather inert in its bulk form, it has become well established in the past decade that highly dispersed Au nanoparticles with dimensions usually less than 10nm are selective for the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols. In particular, the geometries and electronic properties of the Au nanoparticles exert important impacts on the selectivity. Mohr et al. demonstrated that, on Au/ZrO2 catalysts, a higher number of multiple twinned Au nanoparticles results in a lower selectivity to allyl alcohol [7]. Following this finding, they deduced that, to obtain higher selectivity to unsaturated alcohol, one must prepare supported Au catalyst with single crystalline Au particles [8]. In another work, with the technique of electron spin resonance, Claus et al. attributed the high selectivity to allyl alcohol on Au/ZrO2-F and Au/TiO2-SG to the formation of paramagnetic F-centers on the supports during the reduction procedure. Electrons trapped in oxygen vacancies have strong one-electron-donating character, which results in electron-enriched Au nanoparticles, thereby altering the interaction of the active sites with the functional group and facilitating a partial transfer of electron to the π* orbital of the unsaturated bond [9]. Similarly, Milone et al. observed that the more reducible the iron oxide-supported Au catalysts are, the higher is the selectivity toward the hydrogenation of CO, while the basicity of the supports has no relationship with the selectivity [10]. To further enhance the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols, researchers have practiced promotion of Au catalysts via the addition of a second metal such as In [11] or promotion of the reaction liquid via the addition of a second metal ion [12]. Because SiO2 interacts only weakly with Au [13], SiO2-supported Au catalysts [14–16] showed inferior selectivity to Au/ZnO [14,17], Au/ZrO2 [14], Au/TiO2 [15], and Au/CeO2 catalysts [18] in crotonaldehyde (CRAL) hydrogenation to crotyl alcohol (CROL). Recently, we found that, if we utilized the merits of the possibility of surface modification by γ-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) to accommodate functionalities and the strong confinement of the pore system, combining Au nanoparticles and mesoporous siliceous SBA-15 (Au/APTMS-SBA-15) could produce uniformly distributed Au nanoparticles with modified electronic properties, which evoke moderately high selectivity to CROL even at near complete conversion of CRAL [19]. The present work is built on our earlier study on the Au/APTMS-SBA-15 catalyst, with the added dimension of exploring the In-modified Au/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts. Our work is motivated by the pioneering works by Claus and co-workers. They found that In is very efficient in improving the selectivity to allyl alcohol from acrolein on Au/ZnO-I [11] and Ag/SiO2 catalysts [20], as well as in providing a much more detailed investigation on the structural and electronic properties of the Au/APTMS-SBA-15 and Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts. Combined with the spectroscopic and catalytic results, the modification effects of APTMS and In on Au in the liquid phase hydrogenation of CRAL to CROL are interpreted."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Mesoporous siliceous SBA-15 was synthesized according to the protocol by Zhao et al. [21]. Au nanoparticles were immobilized on SBA-15 by employing the procedure described in Scheme 1 . To 150ml of toluene, 2.0g of SBA-15 calcined at 823K for 4h in air was added. Next, 2.0ml of APTMS was added drop by drop and allowed to reflux at 393K for 12h under a blanket of N2. The filtrate was washed with a large quantity of ethanol and dried at 373K overnight; this material is denoted hereafter as APTMS-SBA-15. Then, 5.0ml of a 48.6mM HAuCl4 aqueous solution was brought into contact with 1.0g of APTMS-SBA-15 at 298K for 4h. This was followed by chemical reduction using 1.0ml of a freshly prepared 1.52M KBH4 aqueous solution in an ice water bath. The as-synthesized catalyst is designated as Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15, where the subscript denotes the nominal weight percentage of Au relative to APTMS-SBA-15. Indium-modified Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts (Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15) were prepared as follows. APTMS-SBA-15 was impregnated with the HAuCl4 aqueous solution and then kept at 298K for 4h, followed by impregnating with a desired amount of a 21.8mM In(NO3)3 aqueous solution. Then, the sample was held at 313K for 4h and reduced in a way identical to that of Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15. The nominal In/Au weight ratios are 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.30, and the catalysts are designated Au5.0In0.5/APTMS-SBA-15, Au5.0In0.75/APTMS-SBA-15, Au5.0In1.0/APTMS-SBA-15, and Au5.0In1.5/APTMS-SBA-15 accordingly. It should be noted that the literature Au-In/ZnO-I catalyst was prepared by impregnation with HAuCl4, and reduction in H2, followed by impregnation with In(NO3)3 and reduction in H2 [11]. We found that this method is not applicable for the preparation of the Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalyst because of the loss of the grafted APTMS during the reduction by H2 at 573K. Moreover, the impregnation condition for In(NO3)3 presented here has been optimized. We have also prepared a series of Ga- and Sn-modified Au/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts in similar ways, but we found that Ga and Sn are less effective than In in enhancing the selectivity towards CROL."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The bulk composition was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES; IRIS Intrepid). N2 physisorption was performed at 77K on a Micromeritics TriStar3000 apparatus. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.15418nm). The tube voltage was 40kV and the current was 40mA. The surface morphology and particle size were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL JEM2011). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) spectra were collected on a PerkinElmer PHI5000C spectrometer using the Mg Kα line as the excitation source (hν =1253.6eV). The sample was pressed into a self-supported disc and mounted on the sample plate. After being degassed in the pretreatment chamber at 298K for 4h in vacuo, the sample was transferred to the analyzing chamber with the background pressure better than 2×10−9 Torr. The spectra were recorded after Ar+ sputtering of the surface for 15min. All binding energy (BE) values were referenced to the Si 2p level of SiO2 at 103.3eV [22]. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data were measured for the Au LIII-edge (11,919eV) in the fluorescence mode at room temperature on the 1W1B beamline of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The typical electron beam energy was 2.5GeV and the current was 150mA. The fixed-exit Si(111) flat double-crystal monochromator was used to reduce higher harmonics. The sample with storage liquid was sealed with the Scotch tape and inserted in the sample plate. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were compared after normalization. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were analyzed by the NSRLXAFS 3.0 package according to standard procedures [23]. The experimental backscattering amplitude and phase shift for the Au–Au pair were extracted from the Au foil, and the theoretical parameters for the Au–In pair were calculated using the FEFF8.20 code [24] with Au9In1 as the reference compound."
4,Catalytic testing and product analysis,"2.3 Catalytic testing and product analysis The set-up for the liquid phase hydrogenation of CRAL has been described previously [25]. Prior to the reaction, CRAL was purified by distillation. The hydrogenation was carried out in a 220ml stainless steel autoclave in which 1.0g of the catalyst, 1.0ml of CRAL, and 49.0ml of hexane were loaded. The reactor was purged with N2 followed by H2. After the desired temperature, 393K, was reached, the H2 pressure was raised to 2.0MPa and the stirring (1000rpm) was commenced; this is taken as the beginning of the reaction. The process of the reaction was monitored by analyzing the samples withdrawn from the autoclave at intervals on a gas chromatograph (Finnigan Trace GC ultra) fitted with a 30m HP-5 capillary column and a flame ionization detector (FID). The initial hydrogenation rate of CRAL increased proportionally to the catalyst weight (0.2–1.0g) when other reaction conditions were fixed, confirming the absence of any transport limitations. Every catalyst was evaluated in triplicate, and results from replicate runs agreed to within ±2%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,"Composition, texture and structure","3.1 Composition, texture and structure The compositional and textural properties of the Au/APTMS-SBA-15 and Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts are compiled in Table 1 . The determined bulk compositions of Au and In verify that the initial molar ratio of metal precursors has been almost completely carried over to the final catalysts. The BET surface area and the most probable pore diameter decrease from 764m2 g−1 and 9.1nm for the pristine SBA-15 to 406m2 g−1 and 8.6nm for APTMS-SBA-15, respectively, which signifies that APTMS has been grafted on the mesopore walls of SBA-15. When Au was immobilized on APTMS-SBA-15, a decrement in the BET surface area of only ∼9% was observed, suggesting that Au is highly dispersed without blocking the mesopores. With the increment of the content of In in the Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts, steady but unremarkable decrements in the BET surface area and pore diameter were observed, indicating that Au–In is also homogeneously distributed in APTMS-SBA-15. Fig. 1 shows the small-angle XRD patterns of SBA-15, APTMS-SBA-15, Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15, and Au5.0In0.75/APTMS-SBA-15 as a representative of the Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts. The XRD profile of APTMS-SBA-15 consists of three diffraction peaks indexable to (100), (110), and (200) planes of SBA-15 with two-dimensional hexagonal p6mm symmetry [21]. After loading with Au or Au–In, the preservation of the well-resolved diffraction peaks indicates that the long-range ordering mesostructure was not affected. The slight shift of the diffraction peaks towards larger Bragg angles is an indication of the slight shrinkage of the cell dimension of SBA-15 [26]. The wide-angle XRD patterns of the Au/APTMS-SBA-15 and Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts give broad diffraction peaks at 2θ ≈22 and 39° (Fig. 2 ). The former is due to SBA-15 which is amorphous, while the latter can be assigned to the (111) diffraction of fcc Au (JCPDS 04-0784). However, the presence of the Au–In alloy cannot be excluded for the Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts. For example, some Au–In alloys present the strongest diffraction peak at the Bragg angle similar to Au(111) [27]. The alloying of In with Au in the nanosized scale has been reported at room temperature [28] or at a temperature as low as 77K [29]. In fact, alloy formation has been predicted theoretically and identified experimentally even for metals known to be immiscible in the bulk phase after reducing their particle size (critical size 2–3nm) due to surface melting even at room temperature in bimetallic systems with a large negative heat of mixing [28]. As summarized in Table 1, the Au or Au–In crystallite sizes calculated by X-ray line broadening are very small and increase monotonically in size from 1.6nm for Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15 to 2.3nm for Au5.0In1.5/APTMS-SBA-15. Fig. 3 shows the TEM images and particle size distribution histograms of the Au/APTMS-SBA-15 and Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts. It is directly verified that Au or Au–In spherical nanoparticles that appear as dark dots because of the electron density being higher than that of silica are homogeneously immobilized on the channel walls of SBA-15. And the grafting of APTMS and immobilization of metal nanoparticles do not destroy the regular mesostructure of SBA-15. The particle size distribution histograms plotted by counting above 200 particles demonstrate that the Au and Au–In nanoparticles are essentially monodispersed, inferring the strong interaction of APTMS functionalities with metal nanoparticles. With the increment of the In/Au nominal weight ratio from 0 to 0.30, the mean particle size grows steadily from 1.9 to 3.0nm. As compared to the crystallite sizes derived from XRD, the mean particle sizes of the Au and Au–In nanoparticles measured by TEM are only slightly larger, manifesting that the metal nanoparticles are virtually single crystalline. In addition, the mesopores of SBA-15 are not blocked by the nanoparticles within them and the active sites are thus easily accessible to the reactant molecules for reactions to proceed. In contrast, in the absence of APTMS, the Au/SBA-15 catalyst prepared by impregnation gives rise to Au particles with a size of ∼31nm mainly situated on the exterior of SBA-15 [19] due to the weak interactions between Au and silica [13]."
7,Interaction of Au with APTMS and In,"3.2 Interaction of Au with APTMS and In XPS studies were carried out to obtain the information on the chemical states of Au, In, and N in these samples. In Fig. 4 , the Au 4f7/2 BE for Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15 is 83.5eV, which is 0.5eV lower than that of the bulk Au. Similar negative BE shifts have been recorded for spherical-shaped Au nanoparticles supported on TiO2 [30,31] and SiO2 [30], and was ascribed to the dominant population of coordinatively unsaturated surface atoms on spherical Au nanoparticles. In the inset of Fig. 3a, the spherical rather than the faceted shape of the Au nanoparticles is clearly discerned. Citrin et al. proposed that the reduced coordination number of surface atoms will result in the s→d electron redistribution of the valence band, giving an overall net increase in the localized 5d states and consequently, the lowered BEs of the core levels including the 4f level [32]. The In 3d5/2 BE of the Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts at 443.2eV (Fig. 4) is ascribable to metallic In [22]. In Fig. 4, one can also observe that, with the increment of In, the Au 4f7/2 level shifted steadily to lower BEs. The negative BE shift is small but reproducible: for Au5.0In1.5/APTMS-SBA-15, the Au 4f7/2 BE is 83.3eV, which is 0.2eV lower than that of Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15. The negative BE shift with the increment of In may be an indication of the formation of the Au–In alloy in which some electron is donated from In to Au. Such a direction of electron transfer conforms to the fact that In is less electronegative than Au (Pauling electronegativity: In 1.78, Au 2.54). Radnik et al. reported that the modification of the Au/ZnO-I catalyst with In led to a more pronounced Au 4f7/2 shift of −0.6eV. They attributed this to the selective decoration of the flat facets of the Au nanoparticles, leaving only atoms at the edges and corners available for detection [30]. The much smaller Au 4f7/2 BE shift for the Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts with higher In contents favors a different modification mechanism of In from that of the Au-In/ZnO-I catalyst; this difference can be traced back to the different methods used to prepare these catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4, the N 1s spectrum of APTMS-SBA-15 can be deconvoluted into two components at 399.3 and 401.1eV, which are characteristic of aliphatic amino group and protonated aliphatic amino group in APTMS grafted on silica, respectively [33]. After the immobilization of Au or Au–In, the two N 1s components move concurrently to 399.6 and 401.5eV, suggesting electron transfer from the grafted APTMS to Au or Au–In nanoparticles. Such electron transfer may also show some contribution to the lower Au 4f7/2 BE of Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15; however, since the size and shape of the Au nanoparticles are closely related to the grafted APTMS, their separate contributions cannot be easily disentangled. Table 2 compares the structural parameters of Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15, Au5.0In0.75/APTMS-SBA-15, and Au foil extracted from the EXAFS data. The good quality of the fitting is validated by the close resemblance of the simulated k 3-weighted normalized EXAFS oscillations χ(k) curves to the experimental data shown in Fig. 5 . Referring to Table 2, for Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15, we see that the Au–Au coordination number (N) is 7.6 and the Au–Au distance (R) is 2.80Å; such values conform well to the relationship between the Au–Au coordination number and distance summarized by Miller et al. [34]. Compared to the coordination number of 12 and the interatomic distance of 2.87Å of the Au foil, the contraction of the Au–Au distance for Au nanoparticles with low coordination number is attributed to the increased electron density between the atoms, due to the rehybridization of the valence band electrons [35]. The greater localization of the 5d states is additionally confirmed by the whiteline, an indication of the abundance of the 5d holes, being more attenuated than that of the Au foil on the condition that the local symmetry of the samples remained identical (Fig. 6 ). Thus, our interpretation on the negative Au 4f7/2 BE shift for the Au/APTMS-SBA-15 and Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts is fully in agreement with the XAS results. On the other hand, for Au5.0In0.75/APTMS-SBA-15, the Au–Au coordination number is decreased to 6.9, and the Au–In coordination number is 0.7. The Au–In distance, 2.95Å, is shorter than the summation of the atomic radii of Au and In (3.10Å), signifying the start of alloying between Au and In. It is known that the edge and corner atoms in the Au particles have a coordination number lower than 8 [36], so the low coordination numbers observed here are consistent with the observation of the spherical Au nanoparticles in Fig. 3, which are abundant in these sites."
8,Liquid phase hydrogenation of CRAL,"3.3 Liquid phase hydrogenation of CRAL 3.3.1 The catalytic performance of Au/APTMS-SBA-15 The time course of liquid phase hydrogenation of CRAL over Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15 is presented in Fig. 7 . Similar profiles have been obtained over the Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts, as exemplified by Au5.0In0.75/APTMS-SBA-15, also shown in the figure. The hydrogenation products are CROL due to CO bond hydrogenation, butanal (BUAL) due to CC bond hydrogenation, and butanol (BUOL), the final product with further hydrogenation of either CROL or BUAL, as depicted in Scheme 2 . GC–MS revealed no other products, for the reaction was carried out in hexane and the catalysts are not acidic. It should be mentioned that when CROL or BUAL was used as the reactant under the hydrogenation condition identical to that of CRAL, further hydrogenation to BUOL rather than the isomerization between CROL and BUAL was observed. Table 3 shows that, on Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15, the initial selectivity to CROL (S 0) is 57% and the maximum yield of CROL is 54%. The selectivity and yield of CROL on this catalyst excel the values reported on other SiO2-supported Au catalysts for CRAL hydrogenation. No CROL was detected by Bailie and Hutchings during CRAL hydrogenation on Au/SiO2 and thiophene-modified Au/SiO2 prepared by impregnation [14]. On Au/SiO2 prepared by chemical vapor deposition, the selectivity to CROL is only 9.0% at CRAL conversion of 3.3% [15]. Those findings compare well with our observation that the S 0 is 5% on Au5.0/SBA-15 prepared by impregnation (Table 3). Schimpf et al. reported a better result on Au/SiO2 prepared by incipient wetness: at the steady-state conversion of 8%, the selectivity to CROL is 40% [16]. For supports other than SiO2, Zanella et al. found that the selectivity to CROL is 60–70% in the 5–50% conversion range on Au/TiO2 [37]. And on Au/CeO2 Campo et al. reported a selectivity to CROL of 70% at the CRAL conversion of only 7% in gas phase hydrogenation. When the same catalyst was used in liquid phase hydrogenation, the selectivity drastically dropped to 16% at the CRAL conversion of 20% [18]. We would like to point out that, because of the presence of the methyl group bearing the repulsive steric effect on the CC moiety, the selective hydrogenation of CRAL is less demanding than that of acrolein [2,3,9,38], but a yield of CROL higher than that on Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15 has not yet been reported on other supported Au catalysts [14,15,17,18,37]. According to the characterizations, the grafting of APTMS on SBA-15 results in small and uniform Au nanoparticles that are electron-enriched. The role of the Au particle size on the selectivity in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes or α,β-unsaturated ketones is still controversial [9–11,17,38,39], although it has been acknowledged that smaller Au particles with higher populations of low coordination surface atoms favor the dissociative chemisorption of H2 which determines the hydrogenation activity [38,40]. Nevertheless, most works favor either the relationship: the larger the Au particle size, the higher the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols [9,17], or no direct relationship between the Au particle size and the selectivity [10,38]. This implies that factors other than the Au particle size are more important for the high selectivity to unsaturated alcohols. Based on systematic DFT calculations, Delbecq and Sautet suggested that a higher electron density on metal atoms would reduce the binding strength of the CC bond with the surface, due to an increase of the four-electron Pauli repulsion, and favor more the back-bonding with the π C O * orbital, which is crucial for an improved selectivity to unsaturated alcohols [41,42]. Thus, we attribute the high selectivity to CROL over Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15 to electron donation from the grafted APTMS to Au, which preferentially activates the CO bond of CRAL. This interpretation is in line with the finding that the formation of electron-donating paramagnetic F-centers on the supports during the reduction procedure is beneficial for the production of allyl alcohol [9], as well as this relationship: the more reducible the iron oxide supports, the higher is the selectivity to the hydrogenation of CO [9,10]. In addition, according to Schimpf et al. [16], the single crystalline nature of the Au nanoparticles, as suggested by a combination of XRD and TEM, can be another factor responsible for the high selectivity to CROL. 3.3.2 The catalytic performance of Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 The evolutions of the selectivity to CROL and the yield of CROL on the Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts with the amount of In are summarized in Table 3. Consistent with the previous work [11], indium is remarkable in improving the selectivity to CROL. On Au5.0In0.5/APTMS-SBA-15, the S 0 is 72%, and the maximum yield of CROL is 67%, which are 15% and 13% higher than those on Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15. On Au5.0In0.75/APTMS-SBA-15, the S 0 amounts to 78%, giving a maximum yield of CROL of 71%. It is noteworthy that no hydrogenation product was detected when In/APTMS-SBA-15 prepared by impregnation and chemical reduction was used as the catalyst, demonstrating that In alone is unable to induce the high selectivity to CROL. This difference is further confirmed by the continuous decrease in the S 0 and the yield to CROL when one further increases the amount of In (i.e. Au5.0In1.0/APTMS-SBA-15 and Au5.0In1.5/APTMS-SBA-15). To have a better understanding of the role of In in enhancing the selectivity to CROL on Au/APTMS-SBA-15, one needs knowledge about the variation of the formation rates of CROL (r CO) and BUAL (r CC) extrapolated to zero conversion against the In content; these data are also given in Table 3. On Au5.0/APTMS-SBA-15, r CO and r CC are 42 and 30mmolmin−1 gAu −1, respectively, while on Au5.0In0.5/APTMS-SBA-15, the values are decreased to 27 and 10mmolmin−1 gAu −1, respectively. So, indium does not improve the selectivity to CROL by improving r CO; rather, it simultaneously suppresses r CO and r CC, while the extent of the suppression of the former is about one half of that of the latter. On Au5.0In0.75/APTMS-SBA-15, the highest r CO/r CC ratio is obtained, thus resulting in the highest selectivity and yield of CROL. Aside from the physical coverage of the unfavorable active sites by a second metal as proposed by Mohr et al. [11], based on the negative BE shift of the Au 4f7/2 level with the increment of the In content and the shorter Au–In distance than the summation of the atomic radii of Au and In as revealed by EXAFS, the synergic effect between the electron-deficient In and the electron-enriched Au has been proposed to account for the lower decrease in the hydrogenation activity of the CO bond relative to the CC bond on the Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts [1–3]. On one hand, although metallic In is adverse to the activity of the catalyst due to the preferential surface aggregation of In [11,43], the relatively electropositive In can function as electrophilic sites for the adsorption and activation of the CO bond via the electron lone pair on oxygen, which can be an important adsorption configuration leading to CROL. For example, the higher selectivity to unsaturated alcohol in 3-methyl-2-butenal hydrogenation than in acrolein and CRAL on Pt(111), Pt3Sn(111), and Pt2Sn(111) surfaces is attributed to the preferential formation of the adsorption configuration of the reactant via the CO bond [44]. On the other hand, the electron-enriched Au can reduce in particular the binding strength of the CC bond with the catalyst, favoring more the hydrogenation of the CO bond than the CC bond, just like the promotion effect of APTMS on Au discussed above. For the time being, the possibility that metallic In was transformed to the oxidized state under the reaction condition cannot be excluded. In situ gas phase EXAFS studies with a H2/acrolein feed under reaction conditions show that the In part of the Ag-In/SiO2 catalyst was transformed to oxidized indium compounds, whereas Ag remains completely metallic [45]. The former, under reaction conditions, may function as a Lewis acid and influence the adsorption geometry of CRAL by providing positively charged centers for the coordination of the carbonyl-oxygen, thus enhancing the selectivity in CRAL hydrogenation [1,2]. However, because an in situ high pressure EXAFS cell for liquid phase hydrogenation is not available and the energies of the In K- and L-edges are out of the detection range of BSRF, the nature of In in Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts under the reaction condition remains to be explored. We would like to point out that the Au5.0In0.75/APTMS-SBA-15 catalyst is not only selective, but also stable. In Table 4 , the S 0 and the maximum yield of CROL on Au5.0In0.75/APTMS-SBA-15 remained essentially constant in three successive runs, confirming that the nature of the catalyst did not change during the reaction. The prolonging of the reaction time by ca. 10% after each run was observed, however. This delay is attributed to the weight loss of the catalyst during the recovery step, including centrifugation and washing by ethanol and hexane, since chemical analysis revealed no Au and In in the supernatant in the autoclave after the hydrogenation reaction."
9,Conclusions,"APTMS-functionalized SBA-15 is excellent in immobilizing highly dispersed and uniformly sized Au and Au–In nanoparticles of around 2nm in the mesopores of the material. These Au and Au–In nanoparticles are spherical in shape, and Au and In are probably alloyed. During liquid phase hydrogenation of CRAL, the Au/APTMS-SBA-15 catalyst exhibited higher selectivity and yield to CROL than other SiO2-supported Au catalysts; this is attributable to the strong electronic interaction between APTMS and Au. The Au-In/APTMS-SBA-15 catalysts are more selective, presumably due to the synergic effect between the electron-deficient In and the electron-enriched Au favoring the hydrogenation of the CO bond relative to the CC bond. On the optimal Au5.0In0.75/APTMS-SBA-15 catalyst, the initial selectivity is 78%, and the maximum yield of CROL is as high as 71%. Moreover, this catalyst is stable, showing great promise for the chemoselective hydrogenation of other α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and α,β-unsaturated ketones."
