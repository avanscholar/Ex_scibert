0,Introduction,"Esterification of carboxylic acids is an important reaction in chemical and pharmaceutical industries [1]. The conventional industrial esterification process is carrying out in batch conditions using mineral acids (sulphuric, hydrofluoric, phosphoric) as catalysts [2]. However, this process leads to some serious problems such as side reactions (mainly alcohol dehydration to ether), equipment corrosion and hard isolation of the product. Brønsted acidic ionic liquids (BAILs) are compounds which possess negligible volatility, excellent thermal stability, remarkable solubility and structural variety [3–5]. Moreover, the BAILs (known as protic ionic liquids as well) contain H+ located on the cation and/or on the anion, which makes them promising catalysts for carboxylic acids esterification with various alcohols [6–9]. For example, Bourahla et al. [6] investigated the catalytic performance of BAILs, containing hydrogen sulphate anion ([HSO4]−) and different cation (l-butyl-3-methylimidazole, and l-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-ethyl]-3-methylimidazole) in esterification of acetic acid with C5 C7 and C10 alcohols. Similar to Bourahla et al. [6], Tao et al. [7] and Zhou and co-workers [10] presented the esterification of acetic acid with C1 C4 alcohols in the presence of 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidonium hydrogen sulfate, respectively. The acetic acid esterification with butanol was also investigated when acidic ionic liquids derived from photophilic amides are used as catalysts [11]. In the field of organic synthesis, the mechanism of α-tocopherol esterification with succinic anhydride using the ionic liquid [C5C1Im]+[NO3]− was shown in the papers of Jing et al. [12] and Dong and co-workers [13]. It is generally accepted that the rate determine step in the esterification process is the protonation (activation) of the carboxylic acid [14]. However, in the carboxylic group (COOH), both oxygen atoms (carbonyl‑oxygen one and hydroxyl‑oxygen one) can be protonated. Based on the latter, two mechanisms of carboxylic acids esterification were proposed. The esterification of carboxylic acids via carbonyl‑oxygen protonation (Scheme 1 ) has been presented in the work of Evans et al. [15] for the first time. According to Scheme 1, the first stage of the esterification mechanism is a protonation of carbonyl‑oxygen of the carboxylic acid (A) to form the intermediate B. The latter undergoes a nucleophilic addition with an alcohol molecule to form C. Then the internal atomic hydrogen rearrangement leads to the formation of D. In the next stage of the esterification mechanism, a dehydration process of D is occurred and intermediate E is obtained. Deprotonation of E recovers the initial form of the acidic catalyst and gives the main esterification product (F)."
1,Experimental and computational section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Acetic acid (99.95 wt%), butanol (99 wt%), pyridine (99 wt%) and sulphuric acid (98 wt%) were purchased from Merck. Diethyl ether was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, while hexane (99.4 wt%), heptane (99.8 wt%), toluene (99.8 wt%), xylene (99.6 wt%) and cyclohexane (99.8 wt%) were supplied by Riedel-de Haën. All chemicals were used without any further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The preparation of the diprotic ionic liquid pyridinium hydrogen sulfate ([H–Pyr]+[HSO4]−) follows a procedure described in our previous work [24]. Pyridine (12.77 g, 0.1614 mol) and ultra clean water (8.72 g, 0.4841 mol) were charged into a 0.100 l three-necked flat bottom reactor, equipped with a magnetic stirring, a reflux condenser and a thermometer. The aqueous solution of pyridine was stirred at ambient temperature for 0.5 h, where after the temperature was reduced to 278 K. Then, H2SO4 (15.83 g, 0.1614 mol) was added dropwise over a period of 1.5 h under vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for an additional period of 5 h at 353 K. For solvent removing, the aqueous solution of [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− was distillated at 333 K under reduced pressure (0.050 MPa) and the product was dried at the same conditions for 8 h until the residue mass remained constant. After cooling, the colorless solid ([H–Pyr]+[HSO4]−) was washed with diethyl ether 0.100 l for tree times and dried in vacuum (0.050 MPa) at 353 K for 12 h. FT-IR spectroscopy was used for [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− identification (the IR spactrum is added as supporting material). The infrared spectrum was recorded in the frequency region of 4000–400 сm−1 by means of a Nicolet iS 50 Thermo Scientific FT-IR spectrophotometer equipped with DTGS KBr detector (4 сm−1) at scan's numbers of 32. Before IR analysis the sample was mixed with nujol. Thermal stability of the synthesized ionic liquid was studied by means of Netzsch STA 449 F3 instrument (the TG and DSC curves are added as supporting material). The sample was heated from 298 up to 700 K at 10 K/min under nitrogen atmosphere (0.020 l/min). Characterization results: colorless crystals; melting point: 366 K; thermal decomposition point: 579 K. FT-IR (nujol, ν сm−1): 3397, 3253, 3070, 2951, 2912, 2848, 1639, 1528, 1493, 1290, 1179, 1052, 1004, 885, 845, 750, 673, 575, 456."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The reaction conditions for butyl acetate synthesis in the current work were selected taking into account that the esterification reaction is a highly reversible reaction and the conversion of the reactants is influenced by the chemical equilibrium [25]. Hence, for maximum reagent conversion during the esterification, (i) a large alcohol excess and/or (ii) a physical separation of water are used [26]. In a typical procedure for butyl acetate synthesis, acetic acid (4.17 g, 0.0694 mol), ionic liquid (10 wt%, 0.0024 mol, with respect to the mass of acetic acid) and an appropriate quantity of inert solvent (hexane, heptane, toluene, xylene or cyclohexane) for water removal in the form of azeotrope mixture were placed in a three-necked round bottom flask of 0.100 l capacity. The latter was equipped with a condenser, a Dean-Stark trap, a port for sample withdrawal and a thermometer. Mixing of the reaction fluids was performed by a magnetic stirrer. Once the desired reaction temperature (333, 343, 353, 363 and 373 K, depending on the used solvent) was attained, a known quantity of butanol (15.43 g, 0.2082 mol) to reach an initial butanol-to-acetic acid molar ratio of 3, separately heated to the set temperature, was added into the reactor. This time was considered as a zero reaction time (t = 0). The total reaction time for the catalytic experiment was 60 min. The overall reaction mixture volume in all experiments was 0.0322 l. The reaction progress at given reaction time was monitored by measuring the water content in continuously distilled azeotrope mixture during the reaction. In order to confirm the reaction progress, GC analysis was carried out. For that purpose, at regular intervals of time (5 min), samples (1 ml) were withdrawn and immediately cooled in an ice bath. The reaction mixture were analyzed by GC 7890A (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a flame ionization detector and capillary column HP-INNOWAX, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm. High purity helium at a flow rate of 0.0015 l/min was used as a carrier gas. The oven temperature was programmed at 343 K for 2 min and then it was raised from an initial value of 343–463 K at a ramp rate of 5 K/min. The injector and detector temperature were maintained at 523 and 573 K, respectively. The analytical uncertainty of GC was <3%, which is in accordance with the acceptable limits. The acetic acid conversion was calculated according to Eq. (1). It should be noted that the occurrence of side reactions (such as butanol dehydration) was not registered. (1) X A = C A 0 − C A C A 0"
5,Kinetic and thermodynamic calculations,"2.4 Kinetic and thermodynamic calculations The butyl acetate synthesis catalyzed by [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− was proposed as a second-order reversible reaction. Based on it, a pseudo-homogeneous kinetic model was presented (Eq. (2)). (2) − d C A d t = k 1 C A C Y − k 2 C B C Z Assuming that the (i) reaction products do not present in the initial reaction mixture and (ii) water content in the reaction zone at any moment of esterification progress is zero (expressed by water removing in the form of azeotrope), the second member of the right hand side (k 2 C B C Z) of the Eq. (2) can be neglected. After rearranging of the variables, the integral form of Eq. (2) in terms of acetic acid conversion was derived as: (3) ∫ 0 X A d X A C A 0 − X A C Y 0 = ∫ 0 t k 1 d t The integration of the latter expression yields: (4) 1 C A 0 − C Y 0 ln C Y 0 C A 0 − X A C A 0 C Y 0 − X A = k 1 t The plot of 1 C A 0 − C Y 0 ln C Y 0 C A 0 − X A C A 0 C Y 0 − X A ≡ Y versus time (t ≡ x) is a straight line passing through origin. The slope of the line represents the forward kinetic constant (k 1, l/mol × min) value. The kinetic model adequacy was carried out on Fisher's statistical criteria (F-criteria) [27]. The model adequately describes investigated object if it is carried out the inequality: (5) F exp = m N m − n − 1 ∑ Y exp − Y calc 2 1 N m − 1 ∑ Y exp − Y ¯ exp 2 < F tab f 1 f 2 where, F tab the of Fisher's criterion value, presented in the table for the sample significance value of degrees of freedom numerator f 1 = N(m − n − 1) and the denominator f 2 = N(m − 1), Y exp and Y calc denote experimental and calculated values of a variable magnitude (concentration or yield, for example), Y ¯ is the average value of out parameter on results of parallel experiences. The minimization of the square differences between experimental (X Aexp ) and calculated (X Acalc ) conversions of acetic acid (Eq. (6)) was used for experimental data testing: (6) min θ = ∑ all data samples X A exp − X A calc 2 After the reaction rate constants at different temperatures were determined, the activation energy was directly established by means of the Arrhenius equation in its linear form: (7) ln k 1 = ln k 1 ° − E A RT In order to obtain the enthalpy and entropy of activation for the reaction of butyl acetate synthesis, the Eyring equation (Eq. (8)) was used. (8) ln k 1 T = ln k B h + ∆ S ≠ R − ∆ H ≠ RT Based on the Eq. (8), if the experimental kinetics data ln k 1 T was plotted versus 1 T , the enthalpy of activation can be calculated from the slope − ∆ H ≠ RT . The corresponding entropy of activation was obtained from the intercept, ln k B h + ∆ S ≠ R . Substituting T as experimental temperature and using calculated ∆H ≠ and ∆S ≠, the activation free energy barrier (∆G ≠, Eq. (9)) for pyridinium-ionic liquid catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with butanol was found. (9) ∆ G ≠ = ∆ H ≠ − T ∆ S ≠"
6,Computational details,"2.5 Computational details The quantum chemical calculations were carried out by means of software Gaussian 16 [28]. The three-parameter hybrid model of Becke [29] in combination with the correlation functional of Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) [30] and basic set 6-311 + G(d,p) [31] was used. The criterion of convergence was 10−8 a.u. After molecules optimization, the vibrational frequency calculations were conducted for: (i) transition and ground states confirmation, (ii) determination of the zero-point vibrational energies and (iii) thermal corrections to the Gibbs free energies. The theoretically calculated frequencies were modified by empiric scaling factor of 0.9679 [32]. No imaginary values of the wave numbers for the ground states were observed, which indicates that the optimized geometries are located at the minimum points of the potential energy surfaces. An imaginary frequency for the transition state structure indicated that a saddle point was found. In order to verify the expected connections of the saddle point with the reactants and products, the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) level [33]. The software GaussView 6 was used for results visualization [34]."
7,Results and discussion,"It is known that the esterification of carboxylic acids proceeds via formation of an active carbonyl complex as a consequence of a carboxylic acid–catalyst interaction [35,36]. Therefore, the reactivity of both the acetic acid and the catalyst ([H–Pyr]+[HSO4]−) was necessary to be clarified. For that purpose, the electronic and geometric structure of the acetic acid and [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− were investigated. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surface and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses were carried out to study the electronic structure, whereas the bond lengths values were used in the case of the geometric structure."
8,Electronic structure and geometry of acetic acid,"3.1 Electronic structure and geometry of acetic acid The molecular electrostatic potential surface of the acetic acid is shown in Fig. 1A. The corresponding NPA charges and bond lengths are depicted in Table 1 . In order to describe the acetic acid MEP surface adequately, some color clarification should be made first. The deepest red and dark blue colour areas characterize the electrophilic and nucleophilic reactivity behavior, respectively of the acetic acid. Potential values localized between the two extremes relate the green (neutral) region in the MEP surfaces. Calculations clearly reviled the presence of a significant amount of negative charge (−0.698) on the O2 atom linked to C1 one in the structure of COOH group (Fig. 1A, Table 1). A negative charge (−0.595), in a close extent to those revealed for O2 atom, was detected on the O3 atom as well. In the light of this, the most positive charge of +0.486 was observed on the H4 atom. In addition, positive potential regions on the H6 (+0.231), H7 (+0.231) and H8 (+0.227) atoms were also found. Based on the above mentioned results it could be proposed that both the O2 and O3 atoms can dominate the acetic acid electrophilic reactivity. However, MEP analysis showed that intrinsic value of the charge localized on the O3 atom is notably lower than that (−0.595) obtained by means of NBO analysis. The latter was explained with the O3 H4 bond existence in COOH group. Taking into account that a charge of +0.486 was detected on the H4 atom, it was assumed that O3 atom charge (−0.595) is compensated in a great extent. Hence, the acetic acid reactivity in terms of electrophilic reactions will be dictated predominantly by the positive charge located on the H4 atom. In contrary, the acetic acid nucleophilic reactivity depends mainly on the O2 atom charge value. Bond lengths can be used as an appropriate parameter to describe the geometric structure of a given molecule. The bond length values in the acetic acid are presented in Table 1. We can see that the values of carbon-hydrogen bond lengths are 1.088 Å (C5 H8), 1.093 Å (C5 H7) and 1.093 Å (C5 H6). Therefore, CH bonds in the acetic acid structure could be defined as similar in nature. The values of 1.504 and 0.969 Å were obtained as bond lengths for C1 C2 and O3 H4, respectively. The CC bond length is larger than OH one due to the atoms size difference. A difference between carbon-oxygen bond lengths was noticed as well. Nevertheless C1 O2 bond exhibits a length of 1.205 Å, a value of 1.357 Å was observed as bond length for C1 O3. The type of bond (single or double one) is the main reason of having a difference in bond length. The double bond (C1 O2) obtained smaller value and the single bond (C1 O3) obtained larger value of the bond length because generally bond length decreases in the following order: single bond > double bond > triple bond [37]."
9,Electronic structure and geometry of the ion pare [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]−,"3.2 Electronic structure and geometry of the ion pare [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− The MEP surface for [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− is shown in Fig. 1B. It was established that the MEP of ion pare [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− varies from −0.07172 to +0.05761 a.u. Similar to the aforementioned color classification, the deepest red colour corresponds to regions localized the most negative charge (−0.07172 a.u.), whereas the dark blue colour denotes the most positive (+0.05761 a.u.) one. The areas with potential value close to zero are colored in green. In order to know the intrinsic property of the interactions between the anion and cation in the ion pare [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]−, NBO analysis was conducted (Table 1). Results showed that most of the negative charge is located on the oxygen atoms (O2, O3, O4 and O5) attached to sulphur (S1) one in the anion [HSO4]−. In addition, a negative charge was also detected on the heavy atoms (except C8 and C12) in the pyridinium ring. The electron deficient areas are focused on the H7 (+0.474) atom connected to N13 and on the peripheral hydrogen atoms (H14, H15, H16, H17 and H18) in the cation [H–Pyr]+. A positive charge was observed on the S1 (+2.453) and H6 (+0.487) atoms in the hydrogen sulfate anion as well. Based on the calculated bond order values, it was assumed that S1 O5 (1.858) bond is the strongest one. On the other hand, the bonds C8 C9 (1.499), C9 C10 (1.463), C10 C11 (1.478) and C11 C12 (1.481) in the pyridinium ring are similar in nature. It was already stated that the catalyst used in the current paper is a diprotic ionic liquid. This implies the presence of two hydrogen atoms capable for substrate (acetic acid) protonation – H6 and H7, presenting in the structure of the anion [HSO4]− and cation [H–Pyr]+, respectively. Considering the data presented in Table 1, the O2 H6 bond order (1.113) is significantly higher than the order (0.425) of O3⋯H7 bond. Additionally, the order value of 0.710 was related to the bond H7 N13. At first sight, the obtained results suggest that during an endothermic catalytic reaction (such as esterification) the O3⋯H7 bond cleavage will occurs first. Furthermore, the latter seems confirmed by means of the calculated bond lengths (Table 1). For instance, values of 0.967, 1.378 and 1.140 Å were attained as bond lengths for O3⋯H7, O2 H6 and H7 N13, respectively. Hence, a reagent possessing free (and/or weak-bonded) electron pares (such as acetic acid) can easily attack the unaffected H7 atom in a nucleophilic reaction. However, NBO analysis showed that charges of +0.487 and −0.456 are located on the H7 and N13 atoms, respectively. In addition, the MEP of [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− catalyst undoubtedly displayed that the H7 N13 bond is localized in the surface area with potential value close to zero (Fig. 1B). Therefore, a decreased H7 atom acidity due to a charge compensation effect between H7 and N13 atoms was proposed. Similar results were reported in the work of Fogarty et al. [38] for the ionic liquids [N8,1,1,0]+[HSO4]− and [N4,1,1,0]+[HSO4]−. NBO analysis showed that charges of +0.487 and −0.884 are localized on the H6 and O2 atoms, respectively (Table 2 ). Taking into account the proposed charge compensation effect between H7 and N13 atoms, it was reasonable to assume that a similar effect may also occur in the case of H6 O2 interaction. However, the MEP of [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− clearly revealed the existence of a non-compensated positive charge on the H6 atom (Fig. 1B). The latter could be explained with high electronegativity of the oxygen atoms attached to S1 one. Since the oxygen atoms possess the second highest electronegativity of any atom (3.44 according to Pauling scale) [39], the electron density in [HSO4]− is drawn toward O3, O4 and O5 atoms by an inductive effect. The latter causes the electron density on sulphur atom (S1) to decrease. The formed positive charge (+2.453) is partially compensated by electron density shifting from the hydroxyl (H6 O2) group. As a result, the H6–O2 bond polarity increases (expressed by charges of +0.487 and −0.884, respectively) which makes it more suitable for proton (H+) cleavage. Based on the NBO and MEP analyses it was established that the catalytic activity of the ionic liquid [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− in the butyl acetate synthesis depends on the hydrogen atom (H6) located in the [HSO4]− in the form of hydroxyl group (H6 O2) in comparison with the hydrogen atom connected to the pyridinium ring via H7 N13 bond. This statement was confirmed by means of atoms in molecules (AIM) theory [40], which applies that each chemical bond possesses a critical point (bond critical point, BCP). In the field of BCP, the charge electron density possesses a minimum value along the connecting path and a maximum one in the other two perpendicular directions. The energetic and topological parameters can be calculated after the BCP location in the space. The values of electronic density (ρ) and Laplacian field (∇2 ρ) describe the strength and characteristic of a given bond. The density of the total energy of electrons (H (r)) can be represented as a sum of the kinetic (G (r)) and potential (V (r)) electron energy density at BCP: (10) H r = G r + V r Rozas et al. [41] proposed three criteria for classification of the hydrogen bonds strength: (i) ∇2 ρ > 0 and H (r) > 0 – weak hydrogen bond, (ii) ∇2 ρ > 0 and H (r) < 0 – medium hydrogen bond and (iii) ∇2 ρ < 0 and H (r) < 0 –strong hydrogen bond. The first case corresponds to hydrogen bonds which are electrostatic in nature. The second one characterized hydrogen bonds with electrostatic and covalent contribution, while hydrogen bond with ∇2 ρ < 0 and H (r) < 0 was primary denoted as a covalent one. The ring critical point (RCP) is a point of the electron density within the ring surface and a maximum on the ring line [42]. For the pyridinium hydrogen sulfate, this point was found to be in the middle of several bonds included in the ring formation which confirmed the cyclic nature of the catalyst molecule. The graphical representation of AIM analysis for the [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− is shown on Fig. 2 . We can see that the [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− structure is stabilized via two hydrogen bonds, O3⋯H7 N13 and O4⋯H18 C12. The Laplacian of total electronic for these bonds was obtained as +0.11327 and +0.05899 a.u., respectively. In addition, values of −0.04876 and +0.00208 a.u. were calculated, respectively as an electron energy density for the aforementioned bonds. The bond energy is another important parameter which allows investigation of the molecule stability. The energy of the O3⋯H7 and O4⋯H18 bonds in the [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− structure was calculated by means of relationship of Espinosa and co-workers [43] (Eq. (11)). (11) E H ⋯ O = V r 2 It was found that the O3⋯H7 and O4⋯H18 bonds energy possesses values of −165.19 and −13.89 kJ/mol, respectively. Therefore, the hydrogen bonds O3⋯H7 and O4⋯H18 can be classified as medium and weak, respectively. The electron density at RCP and its Laplacian field were used to describe the hydrogen bonds strength. Thus, values of +0.02328 and +0.17435 a.u. were calculated as electron density and its Laplacian field at the RCP, respectively for pyridinium ring (Cycle 1). In the light of this, the electron density and its Laplacian field at the RCP of the cycle (Cycle 2) formed between the hydrogen sulfate anion and the pyridinium ring via O4⋯H18 bond were found to be +0.00714 and +0.03483 a.u., respectively. The obtained positive values for the electron density showed that the aforementioned cycles possess aromatic character [44]. About the pyridinium ring (Cycle 1) this result was not surprising, while in the case of Cycle 2 it was not expected since the hydrogen sulfate anion is inorganic in nature. Nevertheless, a purpose for the inorganic ring (Cycle 2) aromaticity was trying to be offered. It is known that the aromaticity identification is based on a variety of criteria that use chemical (with aromatic compounds more likely than other unsaturated organic compounds to undergo substitution rather than addition reactions), structural (equal ring bond lengths), electronic (molecular orbital pattern, electron delocalization, electronic excitation) and magnetic properties (magnetic susceptibility anisotropies and 1H NMR chemical shifts) [45]. In the light of this, values of 92.82 and 44.62 kJ/mol were presented as aromatic stabilization energies for benzene and its inorganic analog borazine, respectively [46]. Authors ascribed this behavior mainly to the electronegativity difference between the ring atoms. Our DFT calculation demonstrated a significant difference between the NPA charges values located on the atoms involved in the Cycle 2 structure (Table 1). Hence, it was proposed that the observed Cycle 2 aromaticity was a consequence of the increased ring bond polarities. The Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 aromaticity was confirmed by the computed values of the electron density curvature at the RCP: −0.01975 and −0.00525 a.u., respectively. Howard et al. [44] reported that the curvature of the electron density which is perpendicular to the ring plane at the RCP possesses a significant correlation with the ring aromaticity. The authors pointed out that the more negative the curvature, the stronger the aromaticity. Considering the negative value of −0.00525 a.u., we indicated that the Cycle 2 character is aromatic in some extent. Taking into account that the superior catalytic H-bond donor ability increases when the aromaticity increased [47], the catalytic activity of the ionic liquid [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− in the butyl acetate synthesis should depends on the [HSO4]− capability to generate a proton, as it was stated earlier."
10,DFT calculations of the catalyst acidity,"3.3 DFT calculations of the catalyst acidity Since the acetic acid protonation strongly depends on the catalyst acidity [48], the latter was clarified in our work. Determining the acidity (acid equilibrium constant (pK A)) of the hydrogen atom (H6) in [HSO4]− was important for estimating the active site of [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− catalyst in the reaction of butyl acetate synthesis. The pK A value for the ionic pare pyridinium hydrogen sulfate was calculated using Gaussian 16 program. The protonated and deprotonated forms of [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− were optimized in gas-phase using B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) level. Conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) developed by Tomasi et al. [49] was used to calculate the solvation free energies of the initial and deprotonated forms of the catalyst in water. Following the procedure outlined in the literature [19,50], pK A (defined as pK A = − log K A) can be calculated by means of Eq. (12): (12) p K A = ∆ G aq RT ln 10 where, ∆G aq is the free energy (kJ/mol) of the deprotonation reaction HA → H+ + A−. (13) ∆ G aq = G aq H + + G aq A − − G aq HA In the standard state of 1 mol/l and room temperature, Eq. (13) is presented as follows: (14) ∆ G aq ∗ = G aq ∗ H + + G aq ∗ A − − G aq ∗ HA To convert the calculated gas-phase standard free energy (G g °) from its standard state of 1 atm gas-phase/1 mol/l solution to G g ∗ with a standard state of 1 mol/l gas/1 mol/l solution-phase, the addition of 7.94 kJ/mol (RT ln [1/R g T]) is necessary [51]. Hence, for the free energy of the deprotonation reaction in the standard state, Eq. (15) was obtained. (15) G aq ∗ = G g ∗ + ∆ G sol ∗ = ∆ G g ° + 7.94 + ∆ G sol ∗ where, ∆G sol ∗ is the free energy of solvation in water. The free energy of solvation in water was defined as a difference between the solution free energy at the solution-phase optimized geometry and the gas phase free energy at the gas-phase optimized geometry (Eqs. (16) and (17)) [52]. (16) ∆ G sol ∗ A − = G aq ∗ A − − G g ∗ A − (17) ∆ G sol ∗ HA = G aq ∗ HA − G g ∗ HA The values of gas-phase free energy (G g °(H+)) and solution-phase free energy (∆G sol ∗(H+)) of the proton were taken from the literature as −26.2755 kJ/mol [53] and −1112.526 kJ/mol [51], respectively. Combining Eqs. (12)–(15), the pK Avalue was calculated using an expression presented in the work of Dong et al. [19]: (18) p K A = G ° A g − + G ° AH g + ∆ G sol ∗ A − ∆ G sol ∗ HA − 270.29 RT ln 10 Results showed that a value of +3.2 was established as a theoretical acidity of the hydrogen atom (H6) in [HSO4]− anion (Table 2). Considering that the pK Avalue (+4.8) of the acetic acid [54] is significantly higher than that of the [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]−, we stated that the used catalyst can efficiently promote the butyl acetate synthesis via acetic acid protonation."
11,Transition state,"3.4 Transition state Discussing the electronic structure and geometry of CH3 COOH and [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− it was established that their reactivity depends on the carbonyl‑oxygen atom in COOH group and the acidity of hydrogen atom in [HSO4]−, respectively. In other words, the transition state formation between the acetic acid and the catalyst during the reaction of butyl acetate synthesis should include O18 H26 interaction. The transition state formation via O18 H26 interaction was undoubtedly confirmed by means of the calculated IR spectrum. The latter showed the presence of only one negative frequency of −203.94 cm−1, which characterizes the H26 atom vibration in the TS structure (a list of calculated frequencies is added as supporting material). Optimized molecular structure of the transition state and vectors related to the imaginary frequency are presented in Fig. 3 . The corresponding NPA charges and bond lengths are depicted in Table 1. Results clearly showed that the O18 H26 bond formed between the acetic acid and the pyridinium hydrogen sulfate significantly changed the bond lengths and NPA charges in the resulting TS in comparison with those observed in the ground-stated substrate and catalyst. For instance, the N12 H6 bond length increased from 1.140 to 1.599 Å when the transition state was formed. It slightly increased the NPA charges located on the N12 and H6 atoms, from −0.456 and +0.474 to −0.513 and +0.511, respectively (Table 1). It was found that a value of 1.035 Å characterized the O3 H6 bond length in TS structure (Table 1). The obtained negative charge on the O3 atom in the transition state structure was −0.910, which is considerably lower than those (−0.993) registered for the [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− catalyst. In other words, a decreased electron density on the O3 atom in the transition state structure was detected. Following the changes in the case of N12⋯H7 O3 fragment, it was reasonable to assume that the S1 O3 bond length and the S1 atom charge will be also affected. However, the calculated bond length and NPA charge were practically the same (Tables 1). In contrary, the S1 O2 bond length (1.658 Å) in the [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− decreased noticeably to 1.459 Å after the TS was formed. We proposed that a double bond may characterize the interaction between the sulphur and hydroxyl‑oxygen atom in the TS structure. Considering that: (i) the double bond strength is higher than that of the single one [55], (ii) a strong chemical bond formation occurs via transfer or sharing of electrons between atomic centers and (iii) the S1 charge in the catalyst and TS structure was practically unchanged (+2.453 and + 2.486, respectively), it was suggested that the negative charge on the O2 atom in TS structure should be greater than the negative charge on the O2 atom in the ground-state catalyst. Indeed, values of −0.884 and −0.983 were registered as NPA charges on the O2 atom in [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− and transition state, respectively. The increased electron density on the O2 atom in the TS structure could be explained with higher O2 H26 bond length (1.583 Å) in comparison with those (0.967 Å) registered for the catalyst (Table 1). It assumes that the O2 H26 interaction in the TS structure will be covered to a lesser extent than the O2 H26 interaction in the ground-state catalyst. Calculations showed that the hydrogen bond (O18 H26), which is responsible for the transition state formation, possesses a length value of 1.016 Å. As a result, the NPA charges located on the C19 and O18 atoms increased from +0.797 and −0.595 to +0.891 and −0.710, respectively (Table 1). In other words, the presence of a hydrogen atom (H26) attached to the carboxylic oxygen (O18) in the TS structure causes the C19 O18 bond to be more polarized. The same tendency was observed in terms of the C19 O18 bond length – the latter was changed from 1.205 to 1.311 Å after the TS formation. Hence, we state that the polarized single C19 O18 bond in the TS structure is a result of a double C19 O18 bond cleavage in the acetic acid structure during its protonation. It will be presented that the decreased electron density (significant positive charge) on the C19 atom in the protonated acetic acid plays a crucial role in the esterification mechanism."
12,Mechanism of butyl acetate synthesis catalyzed by the ion pare [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]−,"3.5 Mechanism of butyl acetate synthesis catalyzed by the ion pare [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− A proposed mechanism of acetic acid esterification with butanol in the presence of the ion pare [H–Pyr] + [HSO4]− is illustrated on Scheme 3 . According to it, the TS formation via O18 H26 interaction between the acetic acid and the catalyst was occurred first (step I). The theoretical calculations showed that the O2 H26 bond cleavage (step II) in the TS structure was responsible for the generation of protonated form (CH3C+OHOH) of the acetic acid. During the O2 H26 bond cleavage, a deprotonated form ([H–Pyr]+[SO4]2−) of the catalyst was also obtained. The energetic diagram for the both protonated acetic acid and deprotonated catalyst formation is presented on Fig. 4 . Results showed the existence of two equivalent hydroxyl groups (O18 H26 and O20 H22) attached to the C19 atom in the protonated form of the acetic acid. The latter was confirmed by the absence of a difference in the calculated NPA charges on the oxygen and hydrogen atoms – O18 (−0.586), O20 (−0.547), H26 (+0.537) and H22 (+0.535) (Table 3 ). However, the presence of second hydroxyl group considerably decreased the electron density on the C19 atom in CH3C+OHOH structure. It was evident from greater positive charge value (+0.907) on the C19 atom in CH3C+OHOH in comparison with the charge value of +0.797 detected on the C1 atom in the non-protonated acetic acid (Table 1). Based on the above presented results, it was assumed that the positively charged C19 atom is attacked (step III) by one of the lone pairs on the oxygen atom of the butanol molecule. Then, the esterification mechanism proceeds via a hydrogen ion transfer (step IV) from one oxygen atom to other. It gets picked off by one of the other substances in the mixture (for example, by attaching to a lone pair on an unreacted butanol molecule), and then dumped back onto one of the oxygens more or less at random. A molecule of water is removed (step V) in the next stage, which decreases the electron density on the hydroxyl group. At the last stage of the process, the hydrogen ion was removed from the oxygen atom by reaction with the deprotonated form ([H–Pyr]+[SO4]2−) of the catalyst (step IV), followed by ester production and recovering of the initial catalyst form (step VII)."
13,Kinetics validation of BAIL-catalyzed esterification,"3.6 Kinetics validation of BAIL-catalyzed esterification In order to obtain the kinetic parameters (activation energy, pre-exponential factor, entropy of activation, enthalpy of activation and Gibbs free energy of activation), the rate constant variety was investigated at several different temperatures (333, 343, 353, 363 and 373 K). Moreover, a comparison between the experimental results and the calculated data may verify the validity of the theoretical study. For that purpose, the TS thermodynamic parameters were also obtained using DFT calculations. The experimental data showed that the effect of temperature on the acetic acid conversion is very significant and the conversion of acetic acid increased with increasing reaction temperature (Fig. 5A). The latter was not surprising considering that the esterification process is endothermic in nature [56]. The standard reaction enthalpy value (+81.63 kJ/mol), obtained from the standard formation enthalpies of the reaction components, was found to be significantly higher than zero, verifying the conclusion that increased temperatures promote the acetic acid conversion. The kinetic equation (Eq. (2)) representing the esterification of acetic acid is valid, if Y in Eq. (4) is linearly related with time t. Fig. 5B showed the relationship between Y and t at different temperatures. It was observed that Y is linearly related with time through the origin, irrespective of the reaction temperature. The kinetic model adequacy was confirmed by means of the calculated F-criteria (Eq. (5)). A value of 4.31 was obtained as F exp, which is approximately five times lower than F tab value (19.41). From the k 1values it was found that the rate constant increases with the reaction temperature increasing. The kinetic constant value at reaction temperature of 333, 343, 353, 363 and 373 K was 0.86 ± 0.08, 2.31 ± 0.17, 5.68 ± 0.47, 10.13 ± 0.93 and 17.02 ± 1.29 (l/mol × min, ×10−4), respectively. Further, the forward rate constant k 1 was used to calculate the pre-exponential factor and activation energy in accordance with the Arrhenius relation (Eq. (7)). As shown in Fig. 6A, a good linearity was observed between lnk 1 and 1/T in the temperature range from 333 to 373 K for the acetic acid esterification with butanol. The E A and k 1 ° values were found to be 77.25 kJ/mol and 719.86 × 104 kmol/min, respectively. Since E A is considerably higher than zero, the esterification reaction could be defined as a “low-rate process”. The obtained E A value (77.25 kJ/mol) for [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]− catalyst in this work was close to E A (70.66 kJ/mol) reported by Gangadwala et al. [57] for butyl acetate synthesis in the presence of Amberlyst-15 resin. However, the k 1 ° values for these two catalysts are quite different – 719.86 × 104 kmol/min and 202.80 × 103 kmol/min, respectively. Consequently, it could be assumed that the kinetic constant value was mainly influenced by the pre-exponential factor. It is worth noted that the experimentally obtained E A value (77.25 kJ/mol) practically did not differ from its value (74.74 kJ/mol) calculated by means of DFT method. Using the Eyring theory (Eq. (8)), the corresponding enthalpy and entropy of activation were found. ∆H ≠ and ∆S ≠ from the experimental data were 74.32 kJ/mol and −139.53 J/mol × K. It is well known that the ∆S ≠ equals the change in entropy when the reactants change from their initial state to the transition state [58]. In other words, ∆S ≠ provides clues about the molecularity of the rate determining step in a reaction. Negative ∆S ≠ value indicates that entropy decreases on forming the transition state, which shows an associative mechanism in which two reaction partners form a single activated complex. The latter confirmed already presented theoretical calculations that the mechanism of butyl acetate synthesis involves a transition state formation through acetic acid–catalyst interaction. Similar to the results obtained for the activation energy, the existence of a good correlation between experimental and theoretical values for ∆S ≠ and ∆H ≠ was also found. Hence, values of −192.13 J/mol × K and 69.21 kJ/mol were obtained as ∆S ≠ and ∆H ≠, respectively using DFT calculations. Knowing the ∆H ≠ and ∆S ≠ values, Gibbs free energy of activation (∆G ≠) can be easily found (Eq. (9)). Based on the experimentally and theoretically attained data at 333 K, ∆G ≠ values of 120.78 and 133.15 kJ/mol were established, respectively. Obviously, the experimental free energy barrier was found to be slightly lower than the DFT computed value. As mentioned above, (i) the intermolecular hydrogen bonds played an important role in stabilizing the TS in the reaction and (ii) the calculations in this study were performed with only one molecule of the ionic liquid, and not in a fully gas-phase environment. Hence, a large network of intermolecular hydrogen bonds would be present in the gas-phase system, which would further stabilize the TS and result in lowering the free energy barrier. We summarized that the trend of parameters from kinetic model was in accordance with that obtained from the above DFT calculations. This demonstrated that the proposed esterification mechanism and the corresponding calculated result in this paper were reliable."
14,Conclusions,"The mechanism of acetic acid esterification with butanol using the diprotic Brønsted ionic liquid (pyridinium hydrogen sulfate, [H–Pyr]+[HSO4]−) was investigated theoretically (using DFT at the B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) level) and experimentally. The DFT calculations (expressed by MEP surface, NBO analysis and AIM theory) showed that the catalytic activity of the used ionic liquid depends only on the acidity of the hydrogen atom in [HSO4]− anion. This was related to the [HSO4]− aromaticity appearance, result of the increased bond polarities. Considering the MEP surface and NBO analysis, it was established that the significant electron density located on the carbonyl‑oxygen in CH3COO group influenced the acetic acid reactivity in the butyl acetate synthesis. Hence, DFT analysis indicated that the acetic acid-catalyst interaction (via hydrogen bond formation) increases the polarity of CO double bond in acetic acid. It weakens the electron donating capability of alcohol and decreases the energy barrier of esterification. The trend of thermodynamic parameters from kinetic model was in agreement with that obtained from the DFT analysis. Values of 77.25 and 74.74 kJ/mol were found as experimentally and theoretically observed activation energy. According to the used kinetic model, values of 74.32 kJ/mol, −139.53 J/mol × K and 120.78 kJ/mol were presented as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy of activation, respectively. For comparison, DFT calculation showed that enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy of activation possess values of 69.21 kJ/mol, −192.13 J/mol × K and 133.15 kJ/mol, respectively. Further molecular simulations are in progress to explore the correlation between the structure of different ILs and their catalytic activity in chemical reactions in order to provide useful insights to design different ILs for a variety of industrial applications."
