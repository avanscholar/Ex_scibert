0,Introduction,"Solar energy is a green, clean and sustainable source, it has the advantages of a wider range of applications. Therefore, the development of solar energy is an important way to deal with the current energy shortage and environmental pollution. Since Carey's group found that TiO2 could decompose polychlorinated biphenyls under the irradiation of ultraviolet light and there are no secondary pollutants, the semiconductor photocatalytic technology has been extended to the field of environmental governance [1–5]. The photocatalyst's ability to generate oxidative free radicals to degrade pollutants on the surface is an ideal solvent for environmental problems [6,7]. However, the TiO2 as photocatalysts still exists in high recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes and low utilization of solar energy. Therefore, it is necessary to develop and prepare new photocatalysts. In2O3 is visible light response (λ > 400 nm) in the metal oxide [8]. It is unique electronic configuration that can show higher stability and catalytic activity in the degradation of organic pollutants. However, the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of organic pollutants of pure In2O3 still cannot meet the requirements, mainly because of the high electron-hole recombination rate and the limited visible light absorption capacity. [9]. Thus, it is necessary to overcome two major disadvantages in order to achieve a desirable In2O3 photocatalyst with a developed photocatalytic activity. Ma et al. constructed a ternary In2S3/CdIn2S4/In2O3 heterostructure via a series of fabrication methods and found that the improved photocatalytic efficiency for the hydrogen production was caused by the multiple interfaces between In2S3, CdIn2S4 and In2O3 [10]. Zhang et al. reported a layered ZnIn2S4/In2O3 heterostructure and used it as a photocatalyst to effectively degrade toxic Cr(VI) [11]. According to the above analysis, the formed heterojunction consisting of two different semiconductors not only allows a broad light absorption range but also realizes charge separation by guiding the photoinduced electrons and holes to different semiconductors. This strategy offers some inspirations for how to improve the photocatalytic activity. Metal sulfides have attracted widespread attention from researchers. They have a wider visible light absorption range than In2O3. Compared with oxides, the conduction band of metal sulfide as promising visible light catalyst material is at an enough negative potential. ZnIn2S4 as a sunshine absorption photocatalyst, is a typic AB2X4 compound, which has band gap ranging from 2.1 to 2.8 eV [12,13]. The potential applications in the field of catalysis have caused widespread concerns such as degradation photocatalytic of organic pollutants and photocatalytic hydrogen production [14,15]. Liu et al. experimentally found that two different ZnIn2S4 structures showed different photocatalytic properties. The hexagonal phase ZnIn2S4 is more effective than cubic phase ZnIn2S4 in degrading RhB [16]. Chen et al. designed a heterogeneous photocatalyst by immobilizing ZnIn2S4 In-situ on the surface of porous g-C3N4, which showed efficient photocatalytic activity in the visible light region and excellent stability during the recovery process [17]. Inspired by these reports, Znln2S4 can be combined with In2O3 to construct a heterojunction, which is expected to have great potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production and photocatalytic oxidation. However, it also suffers from some shortcomings. On the one hand, the electrons repulsions on the CB of these two semiconductors inhibit the electron transfer. On the other hand, the formation of heterojunction reduces the ability of redox, which cannot provide enough driving force for a specific photocatalytic reaction. Recently, a new heterostructure system named as step-scheme (S-scheme) was proposed, in which the strong oxidative holes and reductive electrons at a high potential are maintained so that the redox ability of a S-scheme photocatalyst is optimized for increasing utilization efficiency of photoinduced charge carrier in photocatalytic reactions. Up to date, the S-scheme between Znln2S4 and In2O3 is rarely reported. In the present work, a binary In2O3-based material with a flower-like morphology was synthesized by a facile procedure. Firstly, the flower-like In2O3 was prepared by hydrothermal method. Then, by low temperature self-assembly process, Znln2S4 was grown on In2O3 deposited on the nanosheets to form a S-scheme heterojunction, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, PL, DRS and photoelectrochemical test. To evaluate the photoactive catalysts, the RhB and phenol and gaseous acetone were chosen as degradation contaminant in considering from environmental protection. Besides, the catalysts are also expected to be utilized to produce hydrogen from water splitting."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesization of In2O3 flower-like nanoparticles,"2.1 Synthesization of In2O3 flower-like nanoparticles The flower-like In2O3 was fabricated according to previous report [18–20]. Typically, 1 mmol of InCl3 and 5 mmol of NaOH were resolved into 10 mL deionized water under stirring (300 rpm) for 0.5 h, after that, 5 mL of ethyl acetate was added. Then, it was transferred to 20 mL polytetrafluoroethylene-lined stainless steel reaction kettle and sealed. The reaction was continued at 180 °C for 16 h, and then cooled to room temperature. After the reaction, the solution was filtered to obtain a white solid powder product, which was washed three times with absolute ethanol and distilled water and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The dried product was calcined in a tube furnace at 500 °C (15 °C/min) for 3 h to obtain the In2O3."
3,Synthesis of ZnIn2S4/In2O3 heterojunction nanocomposites,"2.2 Synthesis of ZnIn2S4/In2O3 heterojunction nanocomposites ZnIn2S4 were grown on the surface of In2O3 by a convenient low- temperature self-assembly process [21]. Samples were prepared under the same conditions. The different weight of ZnIn2S4 denoted as X% ZnIn2S4/In2O3 (X% = 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%). For instance, ZnCl2 (0.1 mmol), InCl3 (0.2 mmol) and thioacetamide (TAA, 0.4 mmol) were as ZnIn2S4 precursor. Then, 2.7 mmol of fabricated In2O3 were added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 5 min and the stirring was continued in an oil bath at 80 °C. After 2 h of reaction, the product was washed 3 times with water and ethanol and dried at 60 °C to prepare a 5% ZnIn2S4/In2O3 sample. The pure ZnIn2S4 was also fabricated by the same method except for no adding In2O3"
4,Characterization of ZnIn2S4/In2O3 nanocomposites,"2.3 Characterization of ZnIn2S4/In2O3 nanocomposites In order to characterize the morphology and nanostructure of the generated samples, the SEM images were gotten according to JSM-5600LV scanning electron microscopes, which purchased from JEOL and the TEM images were gotten from JEM-2100 transmission electron microscopes, which also purchased from JEOL. The X-ray powder diffraction equipped with a Cu Kα radiation between 10° to 70° was measured. The IR spectra were measured on FTIR spectroscopy (Tracer-100, Shimadzu), which the resolution rate was 1 cm−1 and the scanning wavenumber was from 4000 to 500 cm−1. The specific surface area of the samples was tested by N2 adsorption apparatus (Quantachrome autosorb-iQ-2MP gas sorption analyser with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation). XPS data were measured through a VG Multilab 2000 (VG Inc.), which the excitation source of photoelectron spectrometer was Al Kα radiation and the vacuum setted as 2 × 10-6 Pa. Meanwhile, the energy reference used C 1 s, which the standard binding energy was 284.6 eV. The light absorption efficiency was measured on UV–vis UV-2600 (Shimadzu) diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). Furthermore, the charge separation efficiency was measured through RF-6000 spectrofluorophotometer, which purchased from Shimadzu and the excitation wavelength was 350 nm. The E500 spectrometer (ESR, Bruker) was used to test the OH , h+ and O2 − under light irradiation and the 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline (DMPO, > 99.0%) for OH and O2 − and the 2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPO) for h+ were chosen as the trapping reagent. Furthermore, the ESR spectra of OH were conducted in aqueous solution. Meanwhile, the O2 − was measured in methanol. Furthermore, the spectra of h+ were measured in acetonitrile."
5,Photoelectrochemical test,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical test After cleaning the working electrode with acetone ultrasonically, 1 mm × 2 mm indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive glass was selected. The Nafion (10%) solution was mixed with the catalyst to form slurry, then dropped into the treated ITO and dried at 65 °C. Choose platinum foil and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. In addition, 0.5 M Na2SO4 was chosen as electrolyte. The photochemical test was carried out on the CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd.)"
6,Photocatalytic activity evaluation,"2.5 Photocatalytic activity evaluation Degradation of RhB and phenol: A PLS-FXE300D Xenon lamp with optical filter (>400 nm), which purchased from Beijing Perfectlight, was used as the light resource. During the photocatalytic reaction, ZnIn2S4/In2O3 (0.1 g) was added to 100 mL of organic solution (RhB: 10 mg/L; phenol: 10 mg/L), the suspension was stirred in the dark for 30 min to reach an adsorption–desorption equilibrium before light exposure. Then, the solution was irradiated with magnetic stirring. The 3 mL of the solution was taken out every 15 min. The catalyst was removed from the solution by centrifugation. The spectrophotometer (MAPADA UV6100S) colorimetric method was used to monitor the concentration of RhB and phenol in the degradation process. Fig. S1 shows the experiment of degrading gaseous acetone. The quartz reaction cell customized by the manufacturer and the Xenon lamp was used to simulate the visible light. The In-situ infrared was used to monitor the change of the internal components when the catalyst degraded the gas phase acetone. In short, 0.2 g of the photocatalyst was pressed and fixed on the support of the reactor. Next, the reactor was purged by N2 with a flow rate of 70 mL/min in order to purify impurities. Then, the air was taken into the reaction system as a carrier of gaseous acetone. After 30 min, the system was sealed. After one hour of adsorption in the dark, the gas acetone reached to equilibrium on the catalyst surface. At this time, the acetone concentration was designated as the initial value. In-situ infrared monitoring scans were used to obtain the infrared data for 180 min."
7,Photocatalytic H2 evolution,"2.6 Photocatalytic H2 evolution The research on hydrogen evolution performance is carried out through a reactor equipped with a closed loop and an evacuation device. Add 10 mg of sample to 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.35 M of Na2S and 0.35 M of Na2SO3 as sacrificial agents. Irradiate the reactor with a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a UV filter. (λ ≥ 420 nm, PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight Co.Ltd.). In the water cycle, the temperature of the working solution was maintained at 278 K. The amount of hydrogen evolved is measured by a gas chromatograph (GC 7900) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). To evaluate the photocatalytic properties of the catalyst by a different released within the first hour average rate of H2 evolution."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Structure characterization,"3.1 Structure characterization In Fig. 1 a, it displays the XRD diffraction spectra of the pure Znln2S4, In2O3 and Znln2S4/In2O3 composites. The pure Znln2S4 has characteristic peaks at 2θ = 22.26°, 28.14°, 31.74°, 48.20°, 56.74° and 61.75 °can be indexed to the (220), (311), (400), (440), (533) and (444) planes of tetragonal indium (JCPDS: 65–2023), respectively [22]. For In2O3, the peaks at 21.48°, 30.46°, 37.58°, 50.92° and 60.9° (2θ) can be observed, which can be indexed to (122), (222), (411), (440) and (622) cubic crystal planes (JCPDS: 71–2195), respectively [23,24]. For the Znln2S4/In2O3 samples, all the crystal planes of the In2O3 and Znln2S4 appear. It is also found that the diffraction peak corresponding to (222) of In2O3 shifts with the increase ratio of Znln2S4, which may be due to Znln2S4 In2O3 doped into the crystal lattice caused by [25]. The (222) should be indexed in the XRD data. In Fig. 1b, FTIR spectra of pure Znln2S4, pure In2O3 and Znln2S4/In2O3 are displayed. For the pure In2O3, the peaks at 629 cm−1 and 498 cm−1 correspond to the tensile vibration of octahedral indium oxide [26]. For the pure Znln2S4 sample, 3440, 1640, and 1385 cm−1 were caused by surface absorbed TAA [17], and meanwhile, two peaks could be observed at 1396 cm−1 and 1610 cm−1, which were caused by surface hydroxyl groups from adsorbed water molecules [27]. The absorption band between 1150 and 1250 cm−1 belong to the characteristic absorption of hydroxyl groups in alcohols adsorbed on the surface [21]. The above-mentioned characteristic peaks are also present in the Znln2S4/In2O3. X-ray spectroscopy (XPS) for chemical element composition of the sample for further study of the synthesis and valence. In the spectrum, Zn 3d, In 3d, S 2p, O 1 s and C 1 s correspond to the existence of peak shapes (Fig. S2). It can be seen that, in Fig. 1c, there are two characteristic peaks at 1019.6 eV and 1042.4 eV, of which 1019.6 eV and 1042.4 eV correspond to Zn 3d5/2 and Zn 3d3/2, respectively, signifying the existence of Zn as Zn2+ [28]. Fig. 1d shows two peaks at 165.9 eV (S 2p3/2) and 167.2 eV (S 2p1/2), corresponding to S2- [29]. Fig. 1e is the O 1 s XPS spectrum of the Znln2S4/In2O3. There are three peaks at 527.2 eV, 528.4 eV and 529.3 eV. The 527.2 eV is attributed to oxygen in In-O-In [30], 528.4 eV is a peak belongs to the hydroxyl group adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst and 529.3 eV is a peak generated by chemisorption of water [31]. The peaks at 441.8 eV and 449.4 eV in Fig. 1f correspond to In 3d3/2 and In 3d5/2, respectively [32]. The combined energy difference is 7.6 eV, demonstrating that the In element exists in the In3+ state, which is consistent with the actual situation [33]. These results induce that the Znln2S4/In2O3 composite has been successfully prepared through the mentioned route. Fig. S3 shows N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the pure In2O3 and Znln2S4/In2O3. All the hysteresis loops are similar, which belong to the IV-type according to the BDDT classification. The specific surface area, pore volumes and average pore diameter of the pure In2O3 and Znln2S4/In2O3 are shown in Table S1. It can be seen that the surface area of the pure In2O3, 5% Znln2S4/In2O3, 10% Znln2S4/In2O3, 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 and 20% Znln2S4/In2O3 is 22.701 m2 g−1, 20.110 m2 g−1, 20.334 m2 g−1, 20.817 m2 g−1 and 22.582 m2 g−1, respectively, which indicates that the formation of heterojunction little affect the surface area for In2O3. The slightly decreasing surface area maybe is caused that the formed Znln2S4 affected the surface of In2O3 during the formation process of Znln2S4/In2O3."
10,Morphologic characterization,"3.2 Morphologic characterization Fig. 2 shows SEM images of pure In2O3, pure Znln2S4 and 10% Znln2S4/In2O3 composites. As shown in Fig. 2a, it can be seen that the average particle diameter of pure In2O3, which shows a flower ball shape, is about 1–2 μm. The pure Znln2S4 displays a particle structure with diameter of about 50–100 nm (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 2c, compared with pure In2O3, particles were appeared on the surface of the spherical In2O3, which infers that Znln2S4 is successfully loaded onto In2O3 [10]. Fig. 2d is TEM image of 10% Znln2S4/In2O3. It can be observed that spherical surface of In2O3 is covered with ZnIn2S4 particles, which is consistent with the results of SEM observation. Fig. 2e is high-resolution TEM image of 10% Znln2S4/In2O3. It is found that the lattice fringes on the catalyst surface are clear and crossover. By measuring the lattice spacing, the lattice spacing d = 0.332 nm corresponds to the Znln2S4 (102) crystal plane. The lattice spacing, i.e. d = 0.291 nm, is attributed to the In2O3 (222) crystal plane. The two crystal lattices are clearly interlaced, which demonstrates the formation of heterostructures, thereby facilitating the charge transfer between In2O3 and ZnIn2S4 [34,35]. Meanwhile, mapping scanning of Znln2S4/In2O3 heterojunction was performed, as shown in Fig. 2f-i. It can be seen that the composition elements of photocatalysts such as Zn, In, O and S are distributed in photocatalyst surface, which is uniform and tight. These results testify that the distribution of Zn, In, O and S elements in the sample is uniform, indicating the formation of heterostructures, which provides a good basis for improving the photoinduced charge separation efficiency and photocatalytic activity [36]."
11,The optical properties,"3.3 The optical properties In order to examine the light absorption properties, the samples were characterized by ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). As displayed in Fig. 3 a, pure In2O3 can only absorb the light with wavelength of less than 480 nm, while the absorption edge of Znln2S4 reaches to 600 nm, which proves that the optical response of pure Znln2S4 is better than pure In2O3. The absorption of Znln2S4/In2O3 composites exhibits a significant red shift, indicating that Znln2S4/In2O3 composites had stronger light absorption capabilities, which was conducive to the generation of more photo-generated electrons and holes. In addition, the band gap energy of the prepared samples can be estimated by using the band gap energy and Kubelka-Munk formula (1) to calculate the band gap of Znln2S4/In2O3 with different ratios [37]: (1) α h ν n = k h ν - E g In the formula, α represents absorption coefficient, k represents constant, hν represents photon energy, E g represents absorption band gap energy, n is 2 and 1/2 for direct and indirect band gap semiconductors, respectively and n is 1/2 for Znln2S4/ In2O3 composite material. The relationship between (αhν) 1/ 2 and hν of the sample is shown in Fig. 3b. The band gap energy of pure In2O3 is 2.72 eV and pure Znln2S4 is 2.20 eV, which are close to the results reported in the literature [11]. The band gap energies of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% Znln2S4/In2O3 are 1.93 eV, 1.89 eV, 2.17 eV and 2.25 eV, respectively, which indicates that the band gap energy of Znln2S4/In2O3 composites is smaller than that of pure In2O3. The decreased bandgap may be attributed to the formation of heterojunction between the two semiconductors and the formation of a new photo-generated electron transport channel [38]. The results show that Znln2S4/In2O3 composites can more effectively absorb and utilize visible light than the bare In2O3 [29]. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra are generally used to analyze the separation and recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in semiconductor photocatalysts. Generally, the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is inversely proportional to the peak intensity of the PL spectrum. The photocatalytic performance depends on separation rate of electrons. The PL spectra of pure Znln2S4, pure In2O3 and Znln2S4/In2O3 composites at 350 nm excitation was shown in Fig. S4. It can be seen that the peak intensity of the Znln2S4/In2O3 composite is lower than pure In2O3. The Znln2S4/In2O3 composites showed a weak fluorescence signal, indicating that the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs was greatly enhanced and the light-induced electrons and holes would be more efficiently transferred to surface of the catalyst. Combining the results of DRS and PL, Znln2S4/In2O3 heterojunction has stronger visible light absorption capacity and lower carrier recombination rate, which may be advantageous to enhancing photocatalytic activity [39,40]."
12,Photoelectrochemical properties,"3.4 Photoelectrochemical properties As shown in Fig. S5, the three curves with like slopes and extrapolated x-axis intercepts satisfying the Mott-Schottky frequency-independent behavior criterion. To further photoelectrochemical properties of sample preparation institute, using Mott-Schottky (M−S) curve measured flat band energy. The M−S curve of In2O3 and ZnIn2S4 in the figure has a positive slope, which indicates that both of In2O3 and ZnIn2S4 are n-type semiconductors [37]. As shown in Fig. S6a, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the Nyquis diagram was displayed. Generally, a smaller arc radius corresponds to a lower charge transfer resistance, which indicates that light-excited carriers can be easily transferred at the interface [38]. The results in the figure show that the resistive arc radius of the 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 heterojunction is smaller than that of the original In2O3, which means that the 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 nanocomposite has better performance in the charge moving process. In order to further support the conclusion that light-induced suppression of recombination in the Znln2S4/In2O3 heterojunction, several cycles of transient photocurrent response tests were measured under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig S6b, the light current of 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 is the strongest. The results show that, Znln2S4/In2O3 composite exhibits better separation or light-induced transfer of electrons and holes. Thus, it is contemplated that form a heterojunction between ZnIn2S4 and In2O3 junction facilitate movement of photogenerated charge carriers at the interface."
13,Photocatalytic activity evaluation,"3.5 Photocatalytic activity evaluation The degradation curves of RhB over different Znln2S4/In2O3 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 4 a. It can be seen that the degradation of pure In2O3 and Znln2S4 are 76.0% and 79.0%, respectively. The degradation ability of the prepared heterojunction is significantly increased under visible light irradiation, of which the degradation efficiency of RhB is 86.0% over 5% Znln2S4/In2O3, 88.2% over 10% Znln2S4/In2O3, 93.2% over 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 and 87.7% over 20% Znln2S4/In2O3, respectively. Furthermore, the photocatalytic degradation of RhB complies with first-order kinetics. The calculated results by using the first-order kinetic equation (2) are shown in Fig. 4b [37]. (2) L n C 0 / C t = k app t Where t is the irradiation time, k is the first-order kinetic constant, C0 and Ct represent the initial and real-time concentrations of RhB, respectively. In Fig. 4b, the rate constants of In2O3, Znln2S4, 5% Znln2S4/In2O3, 10% Znln2S4/In2O3, 15% Znln2S4/In2O3, and 20% Znln2S4/In2O3 are estimated to be 0.0161 min−1, 0.0185 min−1, 0.0237 min−1, 0.0249 min−1, 0.0298 min−1 and 0.0253 min−1, respectively. The results show that 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 has the highest rate constant, which is 1.85 and 1.61 times higher than that of pure In2O3 and Znln2S4, respectively. Under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm), the degradation curves of phenol with different Znln2S4/In2O3 photocatalysts are displayed in Fig. 4c. Compared with pure Znln2S4 and In2O3, the phenol degradation rate of Znln2S4/In2O3 is significantly improved, where the degradation of phenol over 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 could reach to 91.9% within 90 min. The photocatalytic degradation of phenol also complies with first-order kinetics. In Fig. 4d, the rate constant was calculated from the slope k of the linear regression. The k of pure In2O3 and Znln2S4 constants are 0.0116 min−1 and 0.0151 m−1 and the k of Znln2S4/In2O3 were at the range of 0.0181 to 0.0237 min−1. Among them, 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 has the highest rate constant (0.0241 min−1), which is 2.07 and 1.59 times higher than that of pure In2O3 and Znln2S4, respectively. From the results, the introduction of Znln2S4 into the In2O3 can efficiently improve the photocatalytic efficiency. In addition, 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 exhibits the best repeated degradation stability, as shown in Fig. S7, where the degradation efficiency of RhB and phenol can still reach to 85.2% and 86.4%, respectively."
14,In-situ FTIR infrared degradation of acetone,"3.6 In-situ FTIR infrared degradation of acetone Photocatalytic degradation of gaseous acetone with visible light (λ > 400 nm) was used to test the photocatalytic activities of 15% Znln2S4/In2O3, In2O3 and Znln2S4 . The infrared monitoring scan spectra are shown in Fig. S8 and Fig. 5 . In Fig. 5a and b, before irradiation (t = 0 h), strong peaks appear at 3005 cm−1, 2937 cm−1, 2749 cm−1 and 1739 cm−1, which are ascribed to characteristic peaks of acetone [37]. It can be observed that new characteristic peaks appear with the proceeding of photocatalytic reaction. As displayed in Fig. 5b, the peaks at 1750 cm−1 and 1720 cm−1 are characteristic peaks of the aldehyde group and the corresponding products are pyruvaldehyde or acetaldehyde [20]. In Fig. 5c, the peaks in 3719–3594 cm−1 is ascribed to H2O, increasing with the degradation of acetone. In Fig. 5d, the peaks of CO2 located at 2350 and 2309 cm−1 also increase with the reaction proceeding [41]. Meanwhile, the two characteristic peaks, i.e. 1375 cm−1 and 1350 cm−1 could be attributed to the hydroxyl group and the corresponding products may be formic acid or acetic acid (as shown in Fig. 5e) [42]. After visible light irradiation for 3 h, the characteristic peaks of acetone are no longer changed. Through the analysis of intermediate products, it was found that pyruvaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde and acetic acid appear in the In-situ infrared spectra. Finally, the acetone is oxidized to CO2 and H2O [37]. Based on these results, the possible degradation mechanism is drawn and present in Fig. 6 [43]. In Fig. 5f, the degradation efficiency of 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 is 93.4%, and meanwhile, the degradation efficiencies of pristine In2O3 and Znln2S4 are 60.3% and 70.2%, respectively. Furthermore, the repeated photodegradation experiments of 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 heterojunction were performed. As shown in Fig. S9, the results exhibit that the degradation efficiency can still reach to 87.5% after four degradations, displaying high stability."
15,Hydrogen production,"3.7 Hydrogen production With the aim of further evaluating the photocatalytic activity of Znln2S4/In2O3, in the presence of the sacrificial agents Na2S and Na2SO3, the hydrogen production was evaluated under visible light, which were 677.5, 2274.2, 2961.3, 3158.3, 5656.8, 3518.0 μmol (Fig. 7 a). Among these samples, 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 has the highest amount of hydrogen production, reaching 5656.8 μmol, which is 8.43 times of pure In2O3. Due to the formation of heterojunction, the photocatalytic efficiency is apparently improved [44]. The AQY was calculated according to Eq. (3) [45]: (3) A Q Y % = ( 2 nH 2 N A h c ) / ( t λ I A ) 100 % Where nH2 , t, λ, I and A present the hydrogen evolution (mol), the irradiation time, the illumination wavelength, the illumination intensity (90 mW/cm2) and the irradiation area (2.0 × 10-3 m2), respectively and NA, h and c present the constant, i.e. 6.02 × 1023, 6.63 × 10−34 J·s and 3.0 × 108 m/s. Herein, the AQY is shown in Fig. 7b. This result suggests that the H2 production is primarily induced by the photocatalysis of 15% Znln2S4/In2O3, the AQY (420 nm) reached to 14.0%, which is much greater than pure In2O3 (1.7%) [46]. Compared with pure In2O3, the excellent hydrogen production efficiency may result from better light utilization efficiency (DRS) and photogenerated electron-hole separation efficiency (PL) [47]."
16,Mechanism exploration,"3.8 Mechanism exploration In order to make sure the free radical during the reaction, the ESR was used to test the OH , h+ and O2 − under light irradiation [3,48]. The ESR spectra of OH , h+ and O2 − over different samples are displayed in Figs. 8 and S10. It indicates that OH and O2 − are not detected under dark condition. However, when the samples were excited by light, the intensity of OH over 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 is greater than that observed over the pure Znln2S4 and In2O3, which the amount of OH is lesser over the pure Znln2S4 and little over the pure In2O3 (Fig. 8a). Besides, the O2 − signals in 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 are also much higher than those observed in the pure Znln2S4 and In2O3, indicating that more O2 − could be produced after the heterojunction formation (Fig. 8b). Meanwhile, for h+ trapping (as shown in Fig. S10), compared to the pure Znln2S4 and In2O3, the h+ signals are greatly weaker after illumination, indicating that more h+ produced. These results confirm that the coupling of Znln2S4 and In2O3 can boost the generation of OH , h+ and O2 −. In order to further study the photo-generated electrons-holes transfer in Znln2S4/In2O3 composites, the energy band potentials of semiconductors can be calculated by using the Mulliken electronegativity theory for toms as follows (4, 5), the energy band potential is shown in Table S2 [1]. (4) E VB = X - E e + 0.5 E g (5) E CB = E VB - E g In the formula, X (In2O3) = 5.28, X (Znln2S4) = 4.86. Ee is the free electron energy on the hydrogen scale, Ee = 4.5 eV and Eg is the semiconductor bandgap energy. The Mulliken equation is used to determine the flat band potential. EVB and ECB represent the edge potential values of VB and CB, respectively. From the formulas (1, 4, 5 and 6), the ECB of In2O3 = -0.58 eV, EVB = 2.14 eV; ECB of Znln2S4 = -0.74 eV, EVB = 1.46 eV. Based on these results, a mechanism diagram can be drawn, as displayed in Fig. 9 . The ECB potential of Znln2S4 (-0.74 eV) was higher than the ECB potential of In2O3 (-0.58 eV) and the EVB (2.14 eV) of In2O3 was lower than the EVB (1.46 eV) potential of Znln2S4. The direction and efficiency of photogenerated charge separation to a large degree depend on the band gap position of each semiconductor [49 20]. In Fig. 9, the heterojunction is formed when ZnIn2S4 and In2O3 are coupled. Since the Fermi levels of Znln2S4 and In2O3 are different, the Fermi levels of Znln2S4 and In2O3 tend to reach equilibrium. When Znln2S4/In2O3 is irradiated by visible light, electrons are generated at the CB of Znln2S4 and In2O3, and holes are generated at the VB of Znln2S4 and In2O3. The electrons will be moved from Znln2S4 to In2O3 in order to achieve energy balance. During the electron transfer process, it will cause various changes of band edge structure at the interface. Specifically, the CB edge of Znln2S4 will bend upward due to the loss of electrons. Similarly, the VB edge of In2O3 will bend downward. After that, an interface internal electric field in junction between Znln2S4 and In2O3 is formed. However, the electrons in the CB of Znln2S4 is more and more difficult moving to In2O3 because the potential barrier is formed by the band edge bending and keeps a high reduction potential. Similarly, the holes in the VB of In2O3 also keep a high oxidation potential. Furthermore, the electrons in the CB of In2O3 tend to transfer to the VB of Znln2S4 and recombine with holes by the drive of the internal electric field. Therefore, the more reasonable mechanism maybe is step-scheme [50,51]. When Znln2S4/In2O3 is irradiated by visible light, the electrons in the CB of In2O3 are trended to the VB of Znln2S4 in the internal electric field. Thus, more concentrated electrons in the CB of Znln2S4 could produce more radical. The rich electrons (−0.74 eV) can capture the adsorbed O2 to form O2 − (−0.33 eV) and contribute to the photocatalytic oxidation reaction [52]. Correspondingly, more holes in the VB of In2O3 also could react with pollutions. the VB potential (+1.46 eV) of ZnIn2S4 is more negative than that of Eθ ( OH–/OH–) (+2.4 eV), OH cannot be produced through oxidation of holes, while it may be indirectly produced through single-electron reduction ( O2 -> H2O2 -> OH) [53]. Meanwhile, the holes accumulated at the VB of ZnIn2S4 can also directly photodegrade organic pollutants [54]. Finally, free radicals react with acetone, phenol and RhB to form intermediates and final products including H2O and CO2 [55]."
17,Conclusions,"A flower-like Znln2S4/In2O3 composite were successfully synthesized by hydrothermal method combining with low temperature self-assembly process. Characterization results show that Znln2S4/In2O3 forms n-n heterojunction. Comparing with pure In2O3 and Znln2S4, Znln2S4/In2O3 has stronger absorption in the visible light region and the absorption boundary has a significant red shift. 15% Znln2S4/In2O3 have the highest photocatalytic performance under visible light to decompose liquid RhB, phenol, gaseous acetone and produce hydrogen. The intermediate products in the process of acetone degradation are acetaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, acetic acid and formic acid and the final products of degradation are CO2 and H2O. Step-scheme heterojunction formed by composite photocatalytic materials provide a new path during the transfer process, improving the photocatalytic performance for the degradation of organic pollutants. Further study indicates that the improvement of photocatalytic performance may be related to the heterojunction interface formation and band matching. This work may provide a new idea for enhancing the use of solar energy by traditional photocatalysts and photocatalytic activities in organic pollutants and water splitting."
