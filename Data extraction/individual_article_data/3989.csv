0,Introduction,"Biomass can be converted into bio-oil via fast pyrolysis to substitute conventional fossil fuels [1]. However, the inferior properties of crude bio-oil, such as high oxygen content, high water content, low heating value and strong corrosiveness, severely limit its utilization [2, 3]. Galle et al. [4] performed the combustion test of crude bio-oil and observed serious corrosion and clogging of injectors. The properties of crude bio-oil could be significantly improved via catalytic upgrading to produce clean, renewable and high-quality liquid fuels. Recently, several upgrading technologies, such as catalytic hydrogenation, catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming and catalytic esterification, etc., have been developed to obtain hydrocarbon fuels, hydrogen and improved bio-oil [3, 5–10]. However, the integral and efficient conversion of crude bio-oil could not be achieved by single upgrading technology due to its complicated composition. Previous studies on the catalytic upgrading of model compounds of bio-oil revealed that ketones and acids could be converted into hydrocarbons, whereas sugars and large-molecular-weight phenolic oligomers tended to produce coke via condensation reaction, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation [11–13]. Therefore, the removal of sugars and phenolic oligomers in bio-oil is of great importance. Molecular distillation is an efficient separation technology, through which acids and ketones are enriched in the distilled fraction while sugars and phenolic oligomers are reserved in the residual fraction [14, 15]. Wang et al. [5, 16–18] carried out the studies on the co-cracking of distilled fraction of bio-oil (and model compounds) with ethanol, and a high yield of liquid hydrocarbons was achieved. However, catalyst deactivation may occur during long-term operation, because of the high unsaturation degree of the remaining monophenol in the distilled fraction. The saturation degree of bio-oil can be increased via mild hydrogenation under a relatively low pressure [19, 20]. Various catalysts have been used for hydrogenation, including noble metal catalysts, Mo-based sulfide catalysts, metal phosphide catalysts and other metal catalysts (Cu, Ni, Mg, etc.) [21]. Pd and Pt have been widely used for bio-oil hydrogenation because of their high catalytic activity [19, 22]. However, considering the complexity of bio-oil components, some oxygenated compounds cannot be efficiently converted over monometallic catalysts. Some previous studies revealed that phenols and carboxylic acids showed low activity and conversion capacity under hydrotreatment conditions compared with ketones, aldehydes, etc. [23, 24]. Therefore, high-performance catalysts are urgently required for efficient conversion of phenols and acids. Recently, the development of bimetallic catalysts has attracted extensive attentions, since the introduction of a second metal can increase catalyst activity, modify catalyst selectivity or improve catalyst stability [25]. Sun et al. [26] performed hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol and revealed that the addition of Fe significantly enhanced the hydrodeoxygenation activity of Pd/C with a higher yield of oxygen-free aromatic compounds up to 83.2% at 450 °C. Cai et al. [27] investigated the hydrogenation behaviors of furfural over several catalysts and found that Ni-Cu/SiO2 bimetallic catalyst exhibited superior performance to Ni/SiO2 and Cu/SiO2 catalysts. The presence of Ni could catalyze the saturation of ring and further hydrodeoxygenation. However, the studies on the catalytic hydrogenation of model compound mixture over bimetallic catalysts are still limited. In this study, some typical compounds, including acetic acid (AcOH), guaiacol (G-OH), phenol (PhOH), furfural (FF) and hydroxyacetone (HAO), were chosen as the simulated bio-oil. Various metals (Pt, Pd, Pt-Fe, Pt-Ni, Pd-Fe, Pd-Ni) supported on SiO2 were adopted for mild hydrogenation. The hydrogenation behaviors over different catalysts were investigated in the temperature ranging from 240 to 330 °C. Finally, the reaction mechanism over bimetallic catalysts was proposed based on the quantitative analysis of products."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The hydrogenation catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, using Pd(NO3)2, Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2, Fe(NO3)3∙9H2O and Ni(NO3)2∙6H2O as metal precursors. The loading amounts of Pt and Pd were both 2 wt%, while that of Ni and Fe were 10 wt%. The preparation procedure of Pd-Fe/SiO2 catalyst was as follows: a requisite amount of Pd(NO3)2 and Fe(NO3)3∙9H2O were dissolved in the deionized water simultaneously. The pretreated SiO2 was then added in the aqueous solution. After stabilization of 12 h, the sample was dried in the oven at 110 °C overnight, and then calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. Finally, the catalyst was sieved to 40–60 mesh. The other catalysts were all prepared using the same procedure."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The BET surface areas and pore sizes of the catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption-desorption using the automated surface area and pore size analyzer (Quantachrome; Autosorb-1). The particle sizes and their distribution were determined by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100F). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The scanning regions of the diffraction angle were 2θ = 10–80°. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. The sample was pretreated with He at 250 °C for 60 min and then cooled to 40 °C. The reduction was carried out with a mixture of 10% H2/He at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min up to 800 °C."
4,Catalytic activity test,"2.3 Catalytic activity test AcOH, G-OH, PhOH, FF and HAO were chosen as the simulated bio-oil, because they are typical bio-oil components and the dominant compounds of corresponding chemical families in the distilled fraction of bio-oil produced by walnut shell pyrolysis. Their functional groups including carboxyl group, phenolic hydroxyl group, methoxyl group, benzene ring, aldehyde group, furan ring, aliphatic hydroxyl group and carbonyl group, are representatives of oxygen-containing characteristics of bio-oil. According to the composition of distilled fraction, the weight ratio of AcOH, G-OH, PhOH, FF and HAO was set at 40:15:15:15:15. Ethanol was introduced as solvent and co-reactant, and the ratio of model compounds and ethanol was 1:1. Consequently, the composition of feedstock was 20 wt% AcOH, 7.5 wt% G-OH, 7.5 wt% PhOH, 7.5 wt% FF, 7.5 wt% HAO and 50 wt% ethanol. Catalytic hydrogenation experiments were performed in a fixed-bed system. The reactor was a stainless steel tube with an inner diameter of 8 mm. The catalyst (2 g) was placed in the reactor and supported on the quartz wool. The catalyst was reduced at a H2 flow of 30 mL/min at 500 °C for 3 h before the reaction. The reactants were introduced by a high-performance liquid chromatography pump and then were nebulized with H2 and fed into the reactor. The outlet gas was cooled by a condenser and separated into noncondensable gases and liquid products. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of reactants was 1 h−1. The reaction temperature ranged from 240 to 330 °C and the pressure was set at 4 MPa."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis An online gas chromatograph (GC, Huaai GC 9560), a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC–MS; TraceDSQ II) system, and a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A) were used to identify the chemical structure of compounds and quantify the unconverted reactants and products. The details about the analysis were mentioned in our previous study [28]. The liquid product yield (Y), reactant conversion (Xi) and product carbon selectivity (Sj) are defined by Eqs. (1)–(3). The symbols “m” and “n” in the equation represent the mass of corresponding substances and the mole number of carbon, respectively. When calculating the product carbon selectivity, the unconverted reactants were excluded. Considering the complicated composition of liquid products, it is reasonable to quantify some typical products although some compounds could not be identified [29]. As determined by TG analysis of spent catalysts, the selectivity of coke in each reaction ranged from 1.1 to 1.9 wt%. Based on the determination of gaseous products, liquid products and coke, the mass balances were calculated and all above 94 wt% for each reaction. (1) Y = m liquid products / m reactants in × 100 % (2) X i = m i in − m i out / m i in × 100 % (3) S j j = liquid products = n j / n reactants in − n reactants out × 100 %"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 Textural properties of catalysts The textural properties of the support and catalysts are shown in Table 1 . The specific surface area declined from 152.1 m2/g to 129.6 m2/g and 120.9 m2/g after the loading of Pt and Pd, respectively. The decline of pore volume was also observed. Further addition of Fe and Ni slightly decreased the specific surface area and pore volume of catalysts. According to the previous study, the decrease of specific surface area and pore volume could be attributed to the dilution effect caused by the active components during the impregnation process [30]. 3.1.2 XRD Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the catalysts. The diffraction peaks detected at 2θ = 39.8°, 46.2°, 67.5° and 81.2° were assigned to Pt, while diffraction peaks at 2θ = 40.1°, 46.7°, 68.1°, 82.1° and 86.6° were typical of Pd XRD patterns. The characteristic diffraction peaks of Fe and Ni were also observed on bimetallic catalysts. It was worth noting that few visible diffraction peaks of Pt and Pd were detected except for a weak diffraction peak of Pt upon Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalyst, indicating that metal promoters could improve the dispersion of Pt and Pd on the support. It was also reported that original diffraction peaks of noble metal disappeared after the addition of other metal components [26, 31, 32]. Furthermore, the weak diffraction peaks at 2θ = 81.8° and 40.5° were assigned to Fe9.7Pt0.3 and FePd3 alloy on Pt-Fe/SiO2 and Pd-Fe/SiO2 catalysts, respectively. 3.1.3 TEM TEM images of the catalysts are displayed in Fig. 2 . The particle sizes determined by TEM are listed in Table 1. The active components were well dispersed with a small average particle size of 4.2 nm for Pt/SiO2 catalyst. Due to the high loading amount of Fe and Ni, local agglomeration of active components on the supports occurred on Pt-Fe/SiO2 and Pt-Ni/SiO2 catalysts, and the average particle sizes were measured to be 15.8 and 9.5 nm, respectively. Compared with Pt/SiO2 catalyst, a larger average particle size of 15.7 nm was determined on Pd/SiO2 catalyst, which might be relevant to the precursor Pd(NO3)2 [33]. However, the average particle sizes of active components for Pd-Fe/SiO2 and Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalysts showed a decline, indicating the improved dispersion of Pd with the addition of Fe and Ni, and this result was in good accordance with the XRD patterns. The microstructure of Pt-Ni/SiO2 was examined by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Fig. 3 shows an STEM image of Pt-Ni/SiO2 and the corresponding element maps for O, Si, Pt and Ni. Bright spots in the figure corresponding to Pt and Ni indicated that the metal species were relatively well distributed in the sample. 3.1.4 H2-TPR The H2-TPR profiles of catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . A negative peak for Pd/SiO2 catalyst (hydrogen desorption peak) at 66 °C was detected, due to the decomposition of palladium hydride (PdH x ) [26, 34]. The Pt/SiO2 catalyst displayed a negative peak at 70 °C, which could be attributed to the hydrogen spillover from Pt. The two hydrogen consumption peaks (221–233 °C and about 400 °C) of Pt-Fe/SiO2 and Pd-Fe/SiO2 catalysts corresponded to the reduction of Fe3+ and Fe2+, and the reduction temperatures were lower than that reported in the literatures [26, 35]. As for Pt-Ni/SiO2 and Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalysts, the broad peaks below 320 °C, which corresponded to the reduction of Ni, shifted to low-temperature-zone compared with Ni/SiO2 catalyst [36, 37]. According to the H2-TPR profiles, the reduction of Fe and Ni could be promoted by the interaction between two metals or hydrogen spillover from noble metals [25]."
8,Catalytic hydrogenation experiments,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogenation experiments 3.2.1 Hydrogenation behaviors over monometallic catalysts Hydrogenation behaviors over Pd/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts were first studied to investigate the conversion and degree of hydrogenation of reactants. Over two monometallic catalysts, the liquid product yields remained about 90 wt% in the temperature range of 240–270 °C, and slightly decreased (~83 wt%) with increasing temperatures. In contrast, the production of gaseous products (CO and C1–4 gaseous hydrocarbons) slightly increased due to the enhanced breakage of CC and CO bond via hydrocracking [38]. The reactant conversions over monometallic catalysts are shown in Fig. 5 . As the reaction temperature increased, the conversion of each reactant showed an increasing trend. Upon Pd/SiO2 catalyst, the conversion of FF exceeded 90% at all the temperatures, and this result could be ascribed to the high hydrogenation activity of FF [27]. The conversion of HAO increased from 68.7% at 240 °C to 78.9% at 330 °C. However, AcOH, G-OH and PhOH exhibited low activity and the maximum conversions were 43.5%, 65.3% and 64.4%, respectively. Compared with Pd/SiO2 catalyst, Pt/SiO2 catalyst showed better conversion capacity. Complete conversion of FF and a high HAO conversion up to 98.0% were achieved. The improved conversion might be owing to the smaller particle size and higher dispersion of Pt component. Besides, the conversion of AcOH was slightly promoted by Pt/SiO2 catalyst and reached a maximum of 58.0%. Olcay et al. [39] also found that Pt was superior to Pd in the hydrogenation of AcOH. However, the conversion of phenols over monometallic catalysts was still low, due to their high activation energies in the hydrogenation reactions [24]. Fig. 6 displays the carbon selectivity of typical liquid hydrogenated products classified into 7 groups, namely furan-ring compounds (FRC, i.e., furfuryl alcohol and 2‑methyl furan), tetrahydro-furan-ring compounds (THFRC, i.e., tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and 2‑methyl‑tetrahydro‑furan), alcohols (i.e., cyclohexanol and 1, 2‑propanediol), ketones (i.e., cyclohexanone and 2‑pentanone), esters (i.e., acetic acetate and cyclohexyl acetate), hydrocarbons (namely cyclohexane) and ethers (mainly diethyl ether). The product distributions over two monometallic catalysts were similar. The dominant products were esters, and their carbon selectivity rose with the increasing temperature, because of the improvement of AcOH conversion. In contrast, the carbon selectivity of alcohols showed a decline at elevated temperatures, due to the secondary reaction (alkylation, etherification, etc.) of 1,2‑propanediol and deoxygenation of cyclohexanol [40]. Furthermore, the carbon selectivities of FRC and ketones with a low saturation degree were higher than that of THFRC and alcohols. This result indicated that the degree of hydrogenation of reactants over monometallic catalysts was insufficient and thus the generation of compounds with high unsaturation degree was favored. 3.2.2 Hydrogenation behaviors over Ni-based bimetallic catalysts Upon Ni-based bimetallic catalysts, the liquid product yields remained about 90 wt% at 240 °C, whereas significantly decreased to about 70 wt% at 300 °C and 50 wt% at 330 °C. Meanwhile, the enhanced formation of gaseous products (CO and C1–4 gaseous hydrocarbons) was found, indicating that Ni favored the breakage of CC and CO bond via hydrocracking under high temperatures. Cai et al. [27] also found the production of gaseous product was notably promoted when Cu-based catalysts were modified by Ni. The reactant conversion and liquid product distribution are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 , respectively. Negligible improvement of AcOH conversion was observed, whereas the conversions of phenols were significantly enhanced with the addition of Ni. The maximum conversion of G-OH and PhOH reached 97.8% and 99.6% at 330 °C over Pt-Ni/SiO2 catalyst, respectively. Similar improvement was also found over Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalyst (94.9% for G-OH and 99.1% for PhOH). However, as mentioned above, the liquid product yields were quite low over Ni-based bimetallic catalysts under high temperatures. Therefore, a low operation temperature was recommended. As shown in Fig. 7, a satisfying conversion of G-OH (about 89%) and PhOH (about 98%) were still achieved at 270 °C over two Ni-based bimetallic catalysts, which were much higher than that over monometallic catalysts (~65.3%). Because of the improvement of phenols conversion, the carbon selectivity of corresponding alcohols (cyclohexanol, 1,2‑cyclohexanediol and methyl-cyclohexanediol) in the liquid products rose. And cyclohexane became the dominant product at 330 °C, of which the carbon selectivity exceeded 35%. As a result, the liquid products obtained at 330 °C consisted of two separable layers (upper layer: cyclohexane, bottom layer: polar products), while homogeneous products were collected under other conditions of various temperatures and catalysts. According to the product distribution, it could be concluded that Ni significantly promoted the saturation of aromatic ring and the hydrogenolysis of methoxyl side chain, as well as further deoxygenation of cyclitol under high temperatures. Besides, the saturation of furan ring could also be accelerated by Ni, which was responsible for the increase of THFRC and the decrease of FRC. Therefore, the conversion capacity of catalysts could be significantly improved with the addition of Ni, and the saturation degree of liquid products was largely increased, which is ready for subsequent upgrading [41]. 3.2.3 Hydrogenation behaviors over Fe-based bimetallic catalysts Upon Fe-based bimetallic catalysts, there was no obvious change of liquid product yield and conversion of phenols, while significant enhancement of AcOH conversion could be seen in Fig. 9 . Upon Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalyst, complete conversion of AcOH was found at all the temperatures, and high conversions up to 93% were also achieved over Pd-Fe/SiO2 catalyst. During the esterification of AcOH, the protonation of carbonyl groups first occurs to generate protonated acid intermediate, followed by nucleophilic attack from the alcohol, and subsequent dehydration to yield the corresponding ester [42]. According to XRD patterns, Fe cations existed in the form of Fe9.7Pt0.3 and FePd3 alloy, which could facilitate the protonation of carbonyl groups and accelerate the conversion of AcOH [43, 44]. Considering that the bio-oil exhibits strong corrosiveness, especially in the high temperature process (i.e., catalytic cracking and reforming) [45], the introduction of Fe was of great significance for the mild hydrogenation of bio-oil. Because of the high conversion of AcOH, esters dominated in the liquid products, of which the carbon selectivity was more than 40%. Furthermore, the isomerization of 2-methyl-furan was also catalyzed by Fe cations to generate 3-methyl-furan. 3.2.4 Reaction mechanism of mild hydrogenation over bimetallic catalysts On the basis of above experimental results, the reaction mechanism of simulated bio-oil over bimetallic catalysts was proposed, as shown in Fig. 10 . FF underwent the hydrogenation of aldehyde group and deoxygenation to produce FRC. There were two routes for further conversion of FRC: (1) hydrogenation of furan ring to form THFRC (blue arrows) and (2) isomerization to generate other derivatives of FRC, for example, 3-methyl-furan (green arrow). The former route could be significantly promoted by Ni, due to the strong interaction between furan ring and Ni, which was even stronger than that between furan ring and noble metals like Pd [46], while the latter route was catalyzed by Fe cations. Cyclohexanol was the typical hydrogenation product of PhOH and G-OH, and the intermediate cyclohexanone was formed via keto-enol tautomerism during the transformation of cyclohexanol [47]. Over Ni-based bimetallic catalysts, the hydrogenation of aromatic ring was promoted and the carbon selectivity of cyclohexanol greatly increased. The unique products, 1,2‑cyclohexanediol and methyl-cyclohexanediol were also produced via the hydrogenolysis of methoxyl side chain of G-OH [19]. These results were reasonable because theoretical study revealed that phenols were easily adsorbed on the Ni surface [10], and this would accelerate the subsequent transformation of phenols. It was reported that Ni-based catalysts could cleave the CO bond easily [48], and thus the generation of cyclohexane was enhanced. Besides, the protonation of carbonyl groups was facilitated by Fe cations so that the esterification of AcOH was accelerated to produce corresponding esters [43, 44]."
9,Conclusions,"In this study, monometallic catalysts (Pt, Pd) and bimetallic catalysts (Pt-Ni, Pd-Ni, Pt-Fe, Pd-Fe) were prepared for the mild hydrogenation of simulated bio-oil. Monometallic catalysts exhibited insufficient conversion capacity. However, the addition of Ni could significantly promote the conversion of phenols, and favored the formation of cyclohexane under high temperatures. The introduction of Fe improved the AcOH conversion by enhancing the protonation of carbonyl groups, and complete conversion of AcOH was achieved. In conclusion, bimetallic catalysts could notably improve the catalytic hydrogenation behaviors of bio-oil, and thus proper bimetallic catalysts could be chosen according to the distribution of chemical families of bio-oil derived from different feedstocks. Generally, Pt-Fe bimetallic catalysts were preferable for the conversion of acid-rich bio-oil, while Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts were recommended to be applied to the hydrogenation of bio-oil rich in phenols."
