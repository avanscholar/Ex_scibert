0,Introduction,"Large-scale utilization of biofuel derived from biomass is a more economical and effective technology route to realize carbon neutrality. The membrane separation technology is considered as a promising method to obtain high purity of biofuel due to its high separation efficiency, low energy consumption, and environmentally friendly [1–3]. Importantly, the urgent demands for high-performance membrane separation technology serving renewable energy production facilitate the development of advanced membrane and membrane materials [4]. Two-dimensional (2D) materials represented by graphene oxide (GO) [5–9], owing to unique atomic thickness, abundant modifiable functional groups, and high aspect-ratio, have been widely used as advanced nano-building blocks for high-performance separation membranes, such as gas separation [10], molecules sieving [11–13], and pervaporation [14,15]. GO membrane with controllably ordered interlayer nanochannels exhibits huge potential for biofuel purification. Especially, fast and high-efficiency water transport channels in GO membrane are the key to satisfy the demand for biofuel dehydration through pervaporation owing the formation of azeotrope between alcohol and water. However, the transfer of water molecules in hydrophilic GO interlayer channels usually results in membrane swelling or even disassembly, influencing membrane separation performance and stability [16–18]. In order to overcome these limitations for GO membranes, there are many efforts including reduction [19,20], molecule intercalation [21–25], covalent cross-linking [26–28], etc. to construct stable and fast water transport channels in GO membrane, expected to break the trade-off effect between permeability and selectivity, as well as membrane stability [29–31]. However, reduction of GO membrane is usually beneficial to enhancement of separation factor due to decrease of d-spacing, yet the total flux decreased sharply. In addition, inorganic nanoparticles intercalated into GO lamina via non-covalent bonding often led to the destruction of the ordered lamellar structure of the GO membrane, and hence the resultant composite membrane failed to effectively block sub-nanometer species [32]. Meanwhile, metal ions or other water-soluble molecules to modify GO membrane may occur dissolution in long-term operation process, creating undesired non-selective defects or even disassembly of membrane structure [33]. Hence, how to high-efficiency utilize the interlayer channels in GO membrane is still a challenge, aiming to simultaneously enhance the membrane separation performance and stability. Herein, we introduced the sub-nanometer functional quasi-spherical nanoparticles (sulfonated carbon quantum dots, SCDs) into GO lamina to create abundant sub-nanometer confinement regions for fast water transport in 2D transport space, as well as make interlayer channels remain stable. Usually, CDs are a kind of low-toxicity and fluorescent nanoparticles, widely used for bio-medical field, and are composed of amorphous, graphite or polymer carbon nanoparticles [34–36], which could ensure a well-assembly between CDs and GO nanosheets owing to their similar chemical structure composition and their π-π interaction each other. Further chemical modification introduced abundant sulfonic acid and amino groups into CDs surface thereby labeled as SCDs. It is worth noting that abundant sulfonic acid groups introduced larger amounts water transport promoters in the lateral direction, as well as abundant sub-nanometer confinement regions were created by SCDs in 2D transport space. Meanwhile, amino groups on SCDs surface can form a strong covalent bonding with the epoxy group on the GO nanosheets through a nucleophilic addition reaction (Fig. 1 ). The synergistic effect between fast water transport channels in membrane and the stable membrane structure makes composite membrane show excellent separation performance and stability for alcohol pervaporation dehydration."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals Graphite (1200 mesh), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30 wt%), anhydrous ethanol, hyperbranched polyethylenimine (HPEI, Mw=600 Da), citric acid (CA) and 1,3-propanolactone (PS) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98 wt%) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 35 wt%) were purchased from Shanghai Titan Technology Co., Ltd. Deionized water was homemade in the laboratory. All chemical reagents were not purified again. Poly (ether sulfone) (PES) ultrafiltration membranes were purchased from Guo Chu Technology Co., Ltd. (China)."
3,Synthesis of GO and SCDs,"2.2 Synthesis of GO and SCDs GO was prepared by a modified Hummer's method [37]. SPEI and SCDs were prepared according to the previous literature [38]. SPEI polymers were synthesized through quaternization reaction of HPEI via ring-opening of PS. 2 g of HPEI and 50 mL of anhydrous ethanol were mixed in a round bottom flask with continuously stirring for 30 min. 2.8 g (1 or 5 g) of PS was added dropwise into the above solution, followed by reaction in 35 °C and stirring continuously for another 2 h. Then, the products were cooled down to room temperature, and white precipitates were collected and washed thoroughly with ethanol by filtration to remove unreacted materials, after which the treated product was completely dried via vacuum drying and labeled as SPEI. SCDs nanoparticles were synthesized via a “bottom-up” hydrothermal method. 2 g of CA and 1 g of prepared SPEI were fully dispersed in 60 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring. The mixture was then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and well-sealed before placed in an oven at 200 °C for 8 h. Afterwards the obtained yellow-brown suspension was dialyzed for at least 3 days to remove unreacted molecular precursors. Finally, the yellow-brown powder named SCDs was collected by freeze-drying. Similarly, CDs were prepared by one-step pyrolysis method. Briefly, 1.051 g of CA was dissolved into 10 mL of water and heated to 200 °C in an autoclave for 4 h. The purification and final treatment of CDs were performed with the same method as mentioned above. As shown in Fig. S1, the calculation result of the sulfonation degree was SCDs-51% (SCDs-42% or SCDs-64%) (the following number represents the percentage of sulfonic acid in SCDs)."
4,Preparation of membranes,"2.3 Preparation of membranes Pristine GO membrane and SCDs/GO membrane were prepared via pressure-assisted method. Graphene oxide aqueous and SCDs aqueous were mixed at a certain doping ratio followed by forming a homogeneous solution. The mixed solution was filtered on a PES substrate under the pressure of 0.8 MPa. All the prepared membranes were stored in an oven at 40 °C overnight before the characterization and pervaporation test. The obtained SCDs/GO composite membrane was named as SCDs/GO-x, where x is the mass fraction of SCDs nanoparticles in the membrane (wt%). For comparison, pristine GO membranes were prepared via the same method."
5,"Characterizations of SCDs, GO, and SCDs/GO membrane","2.4 Characterizations of SCDs, GO, and SCDs/GO membrane The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR, 400MHz/AVANCE III 400) was used to characterize the structure of hyperbranched polymers and nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance) measurements with the scan speed of 10° min−1 were performed at room temperature to investigate the crystalline structures of the SCDs nanoparticles and GO as well as analyze the interlayer distance of composite GO-based membranes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Spectrum 100) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, D/max2550VB/PC) were used to study the chemical composition and combination of SCDs and membranes. The size distribution of the SCDs was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100). Linear optical absorption behavior of SCDs was investigated by UV–Vis light absorption (UV–Vis, UV-2600) measurements. Photoluminescence spectrophotometer (PL, Cary Eclipse) was employed to study the optical properties of SCDs and mixed solution. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Nova NanoSEM 450) was used to observe the membrane surface morphology and cross-section images. A contact angle goniometer (CA, JC2000D1) was used to conduct a dynamic water contact angle measurement, which can monitor the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface. The zeta potential of carbon dots and GO aqueous were calculated using the device (Malvern, Zetasizer Nano ZS90). Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR, MesoMR23-060H–I) was employed to study the molecular dynamics of the water within the membrane. The d-spacing was calculated via Bragg's law [39]: (1) 2 d sin θ = n λ where λ represents the wavelength of the incident wave (λ = 0.154 nm), n refers to a positive integer (n = 1), d represents the crystal planar spacing (nm) and θ represents the X-ray beam incident angle."
6,Membrane pervaporation performance evaluation,"2.5 Membrane pervaporation performance evaluation The home-made pervaporation device was used to evaluate membrane separation performance. The pervaporation device consisted of a membrane module with an effective area of 7.1 × 10−4 m2, a feed circulation system with a peristaltic pump, and a vacuum cooling system. The circulating feed passed through the membrane surface, and the downstream operation pressure was kept under vacuum (pressure below 100 Pa). For the alcohol/water dehydration experiment, the feed consisted of 90 wt% alcohol and 10 wt% water. The separated vapor was cooled by liquid nitrogen and collected in a cold trap. Then the permeation flux J (kg m−2 h−1) at room temperature was obtained according to the following formula: (2) J = M A t where M (kg) is the mass of the collected permeate, A (m2) is the effective area of the membrane, and t (h) is the operation time. Gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC 2014, Japan) was used to analyze the composition of the feed solution and the permeate solution. The separation factor (α) of the membrane was calculated by the following formula: (3) α = P W / P A F W / F A where F W and P W were the water mass fraction in the feed and permeate sides, F A and P A represent the alcohol mass fractions in the feed and permeate side. To guarantee the validity of experimental data, all the pervaporation experiments were repeated three times. And the standard deviation was expressed by error bars to evaluate the separation performance. Permenace ((P/l) i , GPU) and selectivity (β) of the feed components were calculated. A detailed description of calculation can be found in previous works [23]."
7,Calculation of activation energy,"2.6 Calculation of activation energy The effective activation energy (E a ) of water and alcohol molecules was calculated using the Arrhenius equation as follows: (4) J i = J 0 e − E a R T (5) l n J i = l n J 0 − E a R T where J i (kg m−2 h−1) is the permeance flux of an individual component i, J 0 (kg m2 h−1) is the pre-exponential factor, E a (kJ/mol) is the activation energy, R=8.314 × 10−3 (kJ mol−1 K−1) is the gas constant, and T (K) is the feed temperature. E a was evaluated from Arrhenius plots (ln (J i ) vs. 1000/T)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of GO nanosheets and SCDs,"3.1 Characterization of GO nanosheets and SCDs The prepared GO was characterized by FTIR, XRD, XPS and TEM. The FTIR spectrum (Fig. 2 a) of GO showed typical absorption peaks including –OH (3386 cm−1), –C=O (1735 cm−1), –C=C (1618 cm−1) on the six-membered ring, and epoxy -C-O (1031 cm−1), and meanwhile XPS results also exhibited -C-O peak, -C-C peak and –C=O peak (Fig. 2b), which all confirmed successful preparation of GO and the existence of abundant oxygen-containing groups on the GO nanosheet surface. The X-ray diffraction showed the characteristic of GO powder at 2θ of 9.84° (Fig. 2c) and the TEM image (Fig. 2d) of GO nanosheets revealed plenty of wrinkles and folds. SCDs prepared via facile one-step hydrothermal exhibited additional peaks, such as –NH (3244 cm−1,1560 cm−1)，-C-N (1660 cm−1), –S=O (1183 cm−1) and -S-O (1035 cm−1), compared to CDs with typical adsorption bands at around 3438 and 1714 cm−1 for the vibration bands associated with –OH (3421 cm−1) and –C=O (1714 cm−1) (Fig. 3 a), which indicated the successfully anchoring of amine and sulfonic acid groups on the surface of CDs. Similar results were also proved by XPS. In the full-scan XPS spectra (Fig. 3b), SCDs showed additional peaks representing N 1s (400.5 eV) and S 2p (167.9 eV), which are the characteristic elements of amino and sulfonic acid groups. In addition, to obtain detailed chemical structures of SCDs, the four detected elemental peaks were deconvoluted in their respective high-resolution spectra. As shown in Fig. 3c–f and Figs. S2–S3, the new appearance of C–S, C–N, S=O, S–O and S–O/S–C peaks [38] verified the participation of SPEI in the carbonization process of CA to form SCDs. Meanwhile, the XRD pattern (Fig. 4 a) of the CDs and SCDs with different sulfonation degrees showed a broad peak centered at 0.45 nm, which were consistent with the lattice spacing of carbon-based materials [40]. Owing to abundant carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, CDs exhibited a negative potential (−18.70 mV). Compared with PEI, the positive potential of SPEI was weakened because of the introduction of sulfonic acid groups. Meanwhile, SCDs formed via hydrothermal of mixture containing citric acid and SPEI showed negative potential and their negative potential increased with sulfonation degrees (Fig. 4b). The UV absorption spectra (Fig. 4c) of CDs and SCDs solutions exhibited two evident absorption bands at about 237 and 350 nm, corresponding to the π-π* transition of C=C and the n-π* transition of C=O, respectively [41]. The CDs and SCDs solution also showed bright blue luminescence under irradiation at 365 nm UV light, which was consistent with the optical properties reported in other literature [42]. TEM images (Fig. 4d) revealed that the as-prepared SCDs were monodisperse nanoparticles of near spherical morphology. Apparently, the above characterization data indicated that functionalized SCDs were successfully prepared."
10,Membrane morphologies and structures,"3.2 Membrane morphologies and structures A homogenous solution was obtained after mixing the SCDs aqueous (where SCDs-51% was selected as the main research object, which is referred to as SCDs in the following part) and GO aqueous owing to electrostatic repulsion derived from their negative charge (Fig. 5 a). As above mentioned, the SCDs solutions showed obvious fluorescence phenomena. Notably, after the addition of GO, the absorption band for the n-π* transition in mixed solution disappeared (Fig. 5b) and an obvious fluorescence-quenching phenomenon (Fig. 5c) was observed, owing to the π-π interaction between SCDs and GO [43]. Their similar carbon structure composition and π-π interaction each other were beneficial for the fabrication of well-assembly membrane. As-obtained homogeneous solution of GO and SCDs was filtered on a PES substrate by the pressure-assisted method. As shown in Fig. 6 a, GO membrane displayed a typical wrinkles morphology [44] and a membrane thickness of approximately 146 nm. With the SCDs loading increasing (Fig. 6b–e), SCDs/GO membrane also showed visually defect-free surface with typical wrinkles morphology but had a slightly thicker membrane layer (151 nm), while the laminar structure was well preserved. XPS analysis was employed to explore the specific interaction sites between SCDs and GO. The appearance of a new C–N peak and the weakening of epoxy group peak (Figs. S4a–4b) confirmed the formation of an amide bond between SCDs and GO [45]. We analyzed laminar structure of the pristine GO membrane and SCDs/GO membranes using XRD (Fig. S4c) indicating that the main stacked structure of GO membrane did not change after introducing the SCDs under the dry state, which had similar d-spacing of 0.54 nm and 0.55 nm, respectively. In addition, the composite membranes had stable membrane structure with constantly interlayer spacing, whereas GO membrane existed seriously swelling under the water-containing or solvent condition. To further explore the structural stability, GO and different SCDs/GO membranes were sonicated in water for 2 h. The pristine GO membrane fell away from the substrate (Fig. S4d). However, the different SCDs/GO membranes maintained the integrity of GO laminate, which proved that the addition of SCDs greatly increased the interaction between GO nanosheet to prevent swelling, even when the sulfonation degree of SCDs was high. The above results further prove the formation of chemical bonds between SCDs and GO."
11,Separation performance of membranes,"3.3 Separation performance of membranes 3.3.1 Effect of SCDs nanoparticles amount Pristine GO membranes with various deposition amounts (0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 mg mL−1) were first investigated for butanol/water separation. Fig. S5 showed a gradual decrease in total flux (2.53–1.89 kg m−2 h−1) with the increase of deposition amount, but the separation factor increased from 955 to 1459. And hence in order to provide a suitable foundation for the modification of GO lamina structure with SCDs based on modest performance of GO membrane, the deposition amount of GO was selected as 0.6 mg mL−1 for the following experiments. Fig. 7 a showed the effect of SCDs content on the permeation performance of SCDs/GO membranes for butanol pervaporation dehydration process at 343 K. In detail, the total flux and separation factor increased at the beginning and then declined with the increasing SCDs content from 0 to 2.0 wt%. The SCDs/GO-1.6 membrane exhibited the optimized separation factor of 4407 and total flux of 5.88 kg m−2 h−1, which were ∼ four times and ∼ twice higher than the results obtained of pristine GO membrane. However, excessive addition of SCDs might create inevitable non-selective defects and aggregation in membranes, and therefore leading to a decreased flux and selectivity. 3.3.2 Effect of feed temperature and concentration Further, the effect of temperature on the separation performance of the SCDs/GO-1.6 membrane was investigated at different temperature ranging from 303 K to 343 K. The separation performance showed a great improvement with the increase of temperature as shown in Fig. 7b. The total flux increased to 5.88 kg m−2 h−1 and separation factor simultaneously increased to 4407 at 343 K. In order to understand the effect of temperature on the water molecules transport across membrane, the activation energy (E a ) of butanol and water was calculated according to the Arrhenius equation [46]. In the pervaporation process equipped with the SCDs/GO-1.6 composite membrane, the E a of water (19.83 kJ mol−1) is higher than butanol (3.20 kJ mol−1) (Fig. 7c), which indicates that the permeation of water through the membrane is more sensitive to temperature than butanol. After increasing the operating temperature, the permeation rate of water increased more than that of butanol, resulting in an increase in both the total flux and separation factor. In addition, it is well known that feed concentration has a great impact on the performance of alcohol dehydration. The separation performance of the SCDs/GO-1.6 membrane was investigated with different feed concentrations ranging from 5 wt% to 20 wt% at 323 K. As shown in Fig. 7d, both the total flux and the separation factor enhanced constantly with water concentration in the feed. It is worth noting that when the water concentration was 20 wt%, the total flux and the separation factor reached 9.03 kg m−2 h−1 and 3459, respectively. When water concentration in feed increased, the increasing total flux and separation factor can be attributed to the enhancement of driving force for water and the decline of that for butanol. Notably, the enhanced separation performances even at higher water concentrations in feed indicated that the membrane structure can be remained well without swollen even at high water concentration conditions. 3.3.3 Effect of membrane thickness The thickness of the membrane also has an important influence on the separation factor and total flux of the membrane. Therefore, based on the optimal doping ratio of SCDs, the influence of membrane thickness on the dehydration performance of butanol at 323 K was explored. When the membrane thickness was increased from 104 to 384 nm (Fig. S6), the total flux decreased from 4.58 to 2.89 kg m−2 h−1, while the separation factor increased from 1999 to 3407 in Fig. 8 a. This phenomenon was attributed to the increase of transport resistance for water molecules transport, leading to low total flux, and sub-nanometer scale defect free on the membrane surface to enhance separation factor with increasing membrane thickness."
12,Separation mechanism of SCDs/GO membrane,"3.4 Separation mechanism of SCDs/GO membrane In order to explore the role of SCDs in 2D confined channels, based on the optimal doping ratio, SPEI/GO and CDs/GO membranes were prepared in the same manner and their butanol dehydration performances were carried out at 323 K. SPEI is a disordered polymer with sulfonic acid groups, and CDs are nanoparticles with the similar structure to SCDs but without modification of amino and sulfonic acid groups. Ignoring the effect of the driving force on the separation performance, namely permeance and selectivity were calculated to reflect the intrinsic transport properties of the composite membrane. As shown in Fig. 9 a, although the introduction of SPEI could enhance the water permeance and selectivity, the disordered arrangement of SPEI in membrane did not well block butanol molecules. Similarly, unmodified CDs only contribute to the expansion of spacing along horizontal directions, but failed to decrease butanol permeance. Comparatively, the SCDs/GO-1.6 membrane exhibited the best separation performance. When SCDs were introduced into the GO layers, the permeability of water and selectivity increased, while the permeability of butanol decreased. Sub-nanometer functional quasi-spherical SCDs nanoparticles can create a special microenvironment for water transport in membrane to enhance the membrane performance. This may be due to that, under the synergistic effect of SCDs and GO, “free” water molecules could be absorbed in the hydrophilic 2D channels and rapidly diffuse through the SCDs/GO membrane, whereas sorption of butanol was decreased, leading to increase water permeance and decline butanol permeance. In addition, the swelling of the GO laminate was inhibited by cross linking with SCDs, which facilitates water transport with smaller molecular size and inhibits butanol transport in the size-sieving interlayer channels to enhance membrane selectivity. Theoretically, higher hydrophilicity of SCDs facilitates the water transport in membrane, expected to obtain outstanding separation performance. It is well known that the higher sulfonation degree of SCDs, the higher the hydrophilicity [47]. Fig. S7 indicated the SCDs with abundant sulfonic acid groups had high water adsorption amount of 348 mg/g, and meanwhile from Fig. 5d, the water contact angle of the SCDs/GO membranes was significantly decreased, indicating that the introduction of SCDs improved the hydrophilicity of the membranes. As shown in Fig. 8b, with the increase of sulfonation degree of SCDs, the total flux increased from 3.46 to 4.22 kg m−2 h−1 but the separation factor increased at the beginning and slightly decreased later. Although SCDs with higher sulfonation degrees were beneficial to water capture in membrane, aggregation of excessive water molecules in membrane would slightly expand the interlayer spacing (Fig. 9b), further leading to a low separation factor. It is worth noting that aforementioned chemical bonding between SCDs and GO is mainly attributed to the interaction between amine and epoxy groups, which ensures the stability of SCDs/GO membrane in the operation process. Meanwhile, the sulfonic acid groups of SCDs are used to capture water molecules to facilitate their transport across membrane. Thus, it can be seen that the appropriate sulfonation degree can balance the function between the amine and sulfonic acid groups to ensure stable membrane structure and good separation performance. A well-stacked structure for membranes is the key to realize better membrane performance. LF-NMR was conducted to clearly understand the molecular dynamics water confined within the porous materials. The measured relaxation time (T2) of the water molecules can provide the information regarding the void size or confinement degree of molecules in membrane. The pristine GO and SCDs/GO-1.6 membranes were placed in a homemade setup fulling vapor to make water molecules confined in membranes. Usually, the population in the time domain of 0–2.5 ms indicates sub-nanometer interlayer spacing of the GO nanosheets in the lateral direction (sub-nanometer confinement region (I)). Compared with the pristine GO membrane, the SCDs/GO-1.6 membrane presents a narrower population at the region I, which implied that the spacing of the adjacent GO lamina has a more uniform distribution when water molecules were filled. Combined with the XRD pattens of the GO membrane and SCDs/GO composite membranes (Figs. S4c and 9b), the narrowed population of the sub-nanometer confinement region indicates the interlayer swelling was restricted by embedding SCDs. In addition, the relaxation time of the nanometer confinement water (II) shifted from 10 to 2.5 ms, while the quantity of nanoconfinement population slightly reduced from 16% to 14% after introducing SCDs concomitantly. This might correlate with the fact that SCDs occupied the vacancies around the ordered edges of the interlayer spacings. As a result, both the void size and volume were reduced by the embedded hydrophilic SCDs. The schematic diagram of the transport path for water molecules in the SCDs/GO-1.6 membrane was shown in Fig. 9d. The fixed spacing of GO lamina and the rare presence of vacancies around the nanosheets edges will be beneficial to enhancement of water selective permeation [48]. In brief, SCDs with high hydrophilicity not only well capture the water molecules and facilitate the water transport through 2D channels, but also their special structure increases sub-nanometer water transport channels in membrane and mends the vacancies around nanosheet edges, of which synergistic effect improved the membrane performance."
13,Long-term stability and membrane generality,"3.5 Long-term stability and membrane generality The SCD/GO-1.6 membrane was continuously tested over 130 h under 90 wt% butanol/water solution at 313 K. The total flux and water concentration in permeate were maintained at around 3.3 kg m−2 h−1 and 99.53 wt%, respectively (Fig. 10 a). Excellent long-term stability is closely related to the interaction between SCDs nanoparticles and GO. The steady permeation flux and the high separation factor of butanol/water mixture confirmed the high stability of the SCDs/GO-1.6 membrane in solvents and demonstrated their potential in practical applications. Moreover, the membrane in this study exhibited superior separation performance for butanol-water mixtures compared with the state-of-art membranes (including GO membranes, polymeric membranes and inorganic membranes) in the literature (Fig. 10b and Table S2). Furthermore, the SCDs/GO-1.6 membrane was selected as a representative membrane to investigate the water permeation performance when used in different alcohol/water separation systems. It can be seen from Figs. S8–9 that the membrane also had good separation performances for ethylene glycol-water and isopropanol-water mixtures, which was higher than the separation performance of currently reported membranes for the same test conditions (Figs. 10c-d and Tables S3–S4). This showed that the prepared membrane can be widely used in different systems, due to the good interaction between SCDs and GO."
14,Conclusion,"In summary, we prepared advanced GO membranes with fast water transport channels and stable structure. The selected SCDs nanoparticles were strategically embedded into GO nanosheets to construct an effective 2D transfer channel based on GO membranes. SCDs play an important role in alcohol pervaporation dehydration: (a) The amine groups on SCDs were covalently cross-linked with GO nanosheets, which ensures a stable structure of the GO interlayer channels in the longitudinal direction; (b) The sulfonic acid groups on SCDs created a high hydrophilic microenvironment that is conducive to the transportation of water molecules in the lateral direction; (c) Meanwhile SCDs created high proportion sub-nanometer confinement region using fast water transport in 2D space. The synergistic effect between the stable membrane structure and fast water transport channels in membrane has realized the simultaneous improvement of separation performance and long-term stability. This research provides a promising method for the selective water separation of high-performance GO membranes. This study offers a potential way to the fabrication of GO membranes for industrial liquid separation."
