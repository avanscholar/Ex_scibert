0,Introduction,"The worsening energy crisis and environmental pollution made it urgent for mankind to find a kind of clean and renewable energy[1]. Hydrogen was perfectly suited to this need[2,3], and the technology of water splitting for hydrogen production, which used semiconductor photocatalyst to absorb solar energy and excite electrons to reduce H2O to H2 [4,5], has attracted great attention in recent years[6], and a variety of photocatalysts were applied in photocatalytic hydrogen production, such as metal oxide[3,7], metal sulfide[8], nitrides[9], and carbide[10]. On the other hand, solar energy is an important energy source, the application of light, which based the use of solar energy, has also attracted the attention from scholars[11–14]. The key to take the advantage of the visible light in the sunlight for photocatalytic hydrogen production was to find a semiconductor with a suitable band gap. Besides, the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst can be affected by the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, which could be effectively alleviated by constructing heterojunctions[15–17]. CdS, with a suitable band gap (2.4 eV), have been widely used in various photocatalytic reaction play a role as a visible light response photocatalyst[18–20]. Moreover, the negative of the potential of the conduction band (CB) enable the CdS exhibit a strong reduction ability, which would meet the thermodynamic requirements for reducing H2O to H2 [21]. However, the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs and the photo-corrosion of CdS during the photocatalytic reaction limit its application in photocatalysis. Constructing heterojunction between a metal oxide and CdS is an effective way to address the above problem, such as ZnO/CdS[22], CdS@TiO2 [23], and CeO2/CdS[24]. Furthermore, the Co3O4 is a p-type metal oxide semiconductor [25], and generally used as the oxygen production electrode material [26,27]. The recombination of electron-hole pairs of the CdS can be suppressed by the formation of the p-n heterojunction in the CdS/Co3O4 composites [28,29]. In this case, the holes in the CdS can be transferred to the valance band (VB) of Co3O4, which would alleviate the photo-corrosion of CdS. For example, the hydrogen production rate on the modified ZIF-67 (Co) derived Ni/Co3O4/CdS p-n heterojunction was 102.40 μmol·h−1, which was prepared by an in-situ growth method [30]. However, the in-situ growth method could not control the morphology. And during the preparation of the composite photocatalyst, the metal atoms on the metal oxide surface and the sulfur atoms on the metal sulfide surface would form metal-sulfur chemical bonds (M−S), and act as a bridge to accelerate electron transfer between the metal oxide and metal sulfide [31]. Therefore, the form of the Co-S bond would be the key to improve the activity of Co3O4/CdS photocatalysts. In the present work, the Co3O4/CdS composites were prepared by ultrasonication and stirring, and carried out pre-controlled on the morphology before composed rather than by in-situ growth, and want to form a Co-S bond directly between CdS and Co3O4, which enhanced the separation and transfer of photo-generated electron-hole pairs and further improved the photocatalytic activity of Co3O4/CdS for photocatalytic water splitting. The contact interface between the CdS and the Co3O4, the light absorption capacity and the separation of the electron-hole pairs and charge transfer in the Co3O4/CdS composites were studied, and a formation process of Co3O4/CdS p-n heterojunction and a mechanism of Co3O4/CdS p-n heterojunction avoiding the recombination of photocatalytic electrons and holes to enhance photocatalytic activity was proposed."

9,Results and discussion,
10,XRD and Raman,"3.1 XRD and Raman The XRD patterns of CdS, Co3O4, and Co3O4/CdS composites were shown in Fig. 1 A. For CdS, 6 distinct diffraction peaks at 25.1°, 26.6°, 28.2°, 43.8°, 47.9°, and 52.0° corresponding to (100), (002), (101), (110), (103), and (112) plane of CdS (JCPDS card No. 41–1049), respectively[32], were found. While 9 distinct diffraction peaks appear at 19.0°, 36.8°, 38.5°, 44.8°, 55.5°, 59.3°, 65.2°, and 77.3° were found in the Co3O4 XRD pattern, corresponding to the (111), (220), (331), (222), (400), (424), (511), (440), and (533) plane of Co3O4 (JCPDS card 74–2120), respectively[33]. Obviously, the diffraction peaks of CdS and Co3O4 could be found in the XRD patterns of Co3O4/CdS sample, indicating that Co3O4/CdS composites were prepared successfully. With the increase of the Co3O4 amount in Co3O4/CdS composites, the intensity of diffraction peaks attributed to Co3O4 (111) and (220) were enhanced. Interestingly, two new peaks (14.4° and 17.9°) were found in XRD patterns of Co3O4/CdS composites, compare with the CdS and Co3O4, as showed in Fig. 1B, and these two peaks matched with the CoSx (JCPDS card 86–2273)[34], which represented the formation of the Co-S bond between CdS and Co3O4, and the intensity of CoSx peaks increases with the increase of Co3O4 amount in the Co3O4/CdS composites[35]. However, the above two peaks attributed to the formation of the Co-S bond rather than the formation of the CoSx, which resulted in the weak peaks near 17.9°. The Raman spectra of CdS, Co3O4, and 10%-Co3O4/CdS were shown in Fig. 1C. the Raman spectra of CdS and 10%-Co3O4/CdS presented two obvious peaks at 295 and 591 cm−1, which corresponded to the fundamental characteristic first-order and second-order longitudinal optical (1LO and 2LO) modes, respectively[36], and the peak at 213 cm−1 was attributed to the multiphoton scattering[37]. The peaks at 195, 479, 520, 616, and 685 cm−1 were found in the Raman spectra of Co3O4, attributing to the F1 2g, E2g, F2 2g, F2 2g, and A1g phonon modes of Co3O4, respectively[38]. Compared with the Raman spectra of Co3O4, the peaks of E2g and F2 2g of 10%-Co3O4/Cd shifted to 468 and 512 cm−1, which caused by the form of the interaction between Co3O4 and CdS[10]. Distinctly, a new peak located at 412 cm−1 was found, ascribing to the Co-S bond[39,40], which formed between the S atoms on the CdS surface and Co atoms on the Co3O4 surface in the contact process of CdS and Co3O4. In general, the electron–phonon coupling (EPC) strength is evaluated by the intensity ratio of second-order and first-order longitudinal Optical modes (I 2LO/I 1LO), and a larger value of I 2LO/I 1LO corresponds to a stronger EPC interaction[41]. Fig. 1D was the enlarged part of the Raman spectra between 200 and 650 cm−1 of CdS and 10%-Co3O4/CdS, and the I 2LO/I 1LO value of 10%-Co3O4/CdS (I 2LO/I 1LO = 0.5) was larger than that of CdS (0.3), indicating that the excitonic wave function could spread wider with a longer electron-hole separation, which caused by the larger specific surface area provided by 10%-Co3O4/CdS[36]. Furthermore, the Co-S bond was formed on the interface between CdS and Co3O4 in the process of ultrasonic and stirring through the discovery of the corresponding peak (417 cm−1) of Co-S bond in Raman spectra."
11,Morphology analysis,"3.2 Morphology analysis As shown in Fig. 2 A, the SEM image of CdS showed a flower-like nanosheets with a diameter of about 1 μm, which were piled up from a large number of CdS nanosheets[32]. The SEM image of Co3O4 (Fig. 2B) showed the sheet structure with a lot of gaps of approximately 40 nm), which was formed by the accumulation of Co3O4 particles, and the thickness of Co3O4 sheet was about 30 nm[33]. Furthermore, the CdS flower-like nanosheets and Co3O4 sheets could also be observed in the SEM images with low magnification (Fig. S1). In the SME images of Co3O4/CdS composites (Fig. 2 C-F), the contact between the Co3O4 and CdS could be observed: the Co3O4 sheets were broken into small pieces after ultrasound for 2 h and dispersed on the CdS nanoflower surface by stirring for 24 h. With the increase of Co3O4 amount in the Co3O4/CdS composites, more Co3O4 sheets were observed on the surface of the CdS flower-like nanosheets. When the Co3O4 amount was about 11 wt% (Fig. 2F), the CdS surface, which played a major role in photocatalytic hydrogen production, was largely covered by Co3O, therefore, the optical absorption capacity of CdS and the exposed active sites of photocatalytic hydrogen production on the CdS surface were limited[22,42]. To further understand the microstructure and contact of CdS and Co3O4, the TEM images of CdS, Co3O4, and 10%-Co3O4/CdS were captured and shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 . The TEM images of CdS (Fig. 3A) showed a flower-like nanosheet, and the Co3O4 (Fig. 3C) exhibited a sheet structure with a lot of gaps (with a width of about 40 nm), which was formed by the accumulation of Co3O4 particles. As shown in Fig. 3B, the lattice fringes spacing was 0.335, 0.36, and 0.31 nm, which could be indexed as the (002), (100), and (101) planes of hexagonal phase CdS, respectively[31,43], and the (002), (100), and (101) planes of CdS would provide different photocatalytic active sites for the hydrogen production reaction. Meanwhile, in the HRTEM images of Co3O4 (Fig. 3D), the lattice fringes spacing were measured as 0.244 and 0.284 nm, corresponding to the (331) and (220) planes of spinel Co3O4 [26,44,45], respectively. The lattice fringes spacing in CdS and Co3O4 matched well with the result of XRD in Fig. 1. To study the contact between CdS and Co3O4 more clearly, TEM and HRTEM images of 10%-Co3O4/CdS are shown in Fig. 3E and F. After the CdS were composed with Co3O4, the close contact between the CdS (002) and Co3O4 (331) planes could be observed in Fig. 3F, which was the foundation for the formation of the Co-S bonds on the interface. Similarly, the CdS flower-like nanosheets are broken into small pieces under the ultrasound treatment and evenly distributed on the Co3O4 surface (Fig. S3, Supporting Information). In addition, the element distribution of 10%-Co3O4/CdS was characterized by EDS, the contents of the Cd, S, Co, and O elements were shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1, the ratio of the Cd, S, Co, and O elements were close to that of the designed 10%-Co3O4/CdS."
12,XPS analysis,"3.3 XPS analysis The XPS spectra of fully scanned spectra in CdS, Co3O4, 10%-Co3O4/CdS were shown in Fig. S4, and the peaks of Co3O4 (Co 2p and O 1s) and CdS (Cd 3p, Cd 4p, and S 2p) appeared in the fully scanned spectra of Co3O4/CdS, indicating the prepared Co3O4/CdS sample contained CdS and Co3O4, which is consistent with the results of the EDS elemental mapping. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Cd 3d in CdS and 10%-Co3O4/CdS were shown in Fig. 4A, two peaks located at 404.75 and 411.50 eV was presented in the Cd 3d spectra of CdS, which were attributed to the Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, respectively[16,46]. Compared with the CdS, the peaks of Cd 3d5 /2 (404.65 eV) and Cd 3d3 /2 (411.40 eV) of 10%-Co3O4/CdS both exhibited a 0.1 eV blue shift, which could cause by the bonding of S atoms with Co atoms. The change of binding energy was related to the change of the surface electron density, which caused by the electron transfer between semiconductors[42]. Two peaks at 160.70 eV (S 2p3/2) and 161.80 eV (S 2p1/2) appeared in the S 2p XPS spectra of CdS (Fig. 4B), which were attributed to S2- [47], and the XPS spectra of S 2p in 10%-Co3O4/CdS (Fig. 4b) showed four peaks located at 160.80, 161.30, 161.90, and 162.80 eV. Among them, 160.80 and 161.90 eV correspond to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of Co3O4/CdS, which red-shifted by 0.1 eV compared with pure CdS, caused by the formation of the Co-S bond[31], indicating the close interaction between CdS and Co3O4. In addition, the peaks at 161.30 and 162.80 eV attributed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of the Co-S bond, which confirmed the formation of the Co-S bond[48]. In the high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p in Co3O4 and 10%-Co3O4/CdS (Fig. 4C), two spin–orbit peaks accompanied with two satellites peaks(sat)[49] were found. For the Co3O4, two satellite peaks located at 788.10 and 803.40 eV, and the other two major peaks belonged to the spin-orbits of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, with an interval of 15 eV between the two peaks[50], and the peak area of Co 2p1/2 was half of the peak area of Co 2p3/2. Furthermore, two spin–orbit peaks were further divided into another two peaks, locating at 778.40, 779.75, 793.45, and 794.90 eV corresponding to Co3+ 2p3/2, Co2+ 2p3/2, Co3+ 2p1/2, and Co2+ 2p1/2, respectively, which were mainly attributed to the oxidation state of Co2+an Co3+ [25]. For the spin-orbits of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 in the 10%-Co3O4/CdS, the peak interval (15 eV) and peak area ratio (0.5) did not change. Similarly, the two satellite peaks (centered at 788.10 and 803.40 eV) exhibited no shift in comparison with Co3O4. Compared with Co3O4, the binding energy of the peaks of Co3+ 2p3/2, Co2+ 2p3/2, Co3+ 2p1/2, and Co2+ 2p1/2 in 10%-Co3O4/CdS were both blue-shift to 779.00, 780.45, 794.10, and 795.70 eV, respectively. Interestingly, the area ratio of the Co3+/Co2+ in Co3O4 was 0.75, while that in the 10%-Co3O4/CdS was 0.933, and the higher surface Co3+/Co2+ ratio meant a higher Co3+ amount on the 10%-Co3O4/CdS surface[51]. The reason for the decrease of the Co2+ amount was that the oxidation state of Co2+ formed the Co-S bond with S atoms on the surface of CdS in the process of compounding with CdS, and the increase of Co3+ amount also proved that the converting of Co2+ to Co3+ in the contact process of CdS and Co3O4. Combined with the XPS spectra results of Cd 3d and Co 2p, the possible interaction and electron transfer between the CdS and the Co3O4 was further analyzed: the decrease in the binding energy of Cd 3d caused by the electron density increasing on the CdS surface, while the reduction of electron density occurred on the Co3O4 surface caused a blue-shift of the binding energy[52]. As shown in Fig. 4D, three peaks were found in the O 1 s spectrum of Co3O4, which corresponded to O-Co (529.35 eV), oxygen vacancy (530.05 eV), and O-H (531.85 eV), respectively. Among them, the oxygen vacancy sites were caused by the oxygen vacancy defect sites with low oxygen coordination number[25], while the peak at 531.85 eV belonged to the O-H species with the surface absorption of water[53]. For the 10%-Co3O4/CdS, the binding energy of O-Co, oxygen vacancy, and O-H shifted to 528.95 eV, 530.60 eV, and 532.10 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the ratio of Co-O and oxygen vacancy peaks area in 10%-Co3O4/CdS decreased from 46% to 24% in comparison with that in Co3O4, indicating the Co atoms on the Co3O4 surface could form the Co-S bond: based on the contact between CdS and Co3O4, Co atom and S atom bond on the surface, the ratio of Co-O peaks area decreased, while exposing more oxygen vacancies made the ratio of oxygen vacancy peaks area increase."
13,Textural properties,"3.4 Textural properties The specific surface area and pore volume of CdS, Co3O4, and Co3O4/CdS composites are one of the important factors affecting the photocatalytic activity, which could be studied by N2 adsorption–desorption (Fig. 5 A and B). The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of CdS, Co3O4, and Co3O4/CdS composites were type II isotherms, and showed type H3 loops at high relative pressure (p/p 0)[54], corresponding to the slit-type pores formed by a large number of CdS nanosheets and the mesoporous or macropores of Co3O4 [55]. From Fig. 5B, the Co3O4 showed a pore size distribution at ~ 40 and 80 nm, indicating the mesoporous and macropores structure existed in the Co3O4. With the increase of the Co3O4 amount in the Co3O4/CdS composites, the specific surface area and pore volume of the photocatalyst gradually increased, and 10%-Co3O4/CdS exhibited the maximum specific surface area (48.23 m3∙g−1) and pore volume (12.12 nm). The textural properties were shown in Table 1 ."
14,FT-IR and UV–vis diffuse reflectance,"3.5 FT-IR and UV–vis diffuse reflectance The surface group and chemical composition of photocatalyst were studied by the FTIR, the IR spectra of the CdS, Co3O4, and CdS/Co3O4 composites were shown in Fig. 5C. In the FTIR spectra of CdS, two peaks were found at 3250 and 1580 cm−1, which could be ascribed to the stretching and bending vibrations of N-H[56]. The peaks corresponded to the O-H stretching and O-H vibration of water absorbed on the photocatalysts were found at 3450 and 1650 cm−1, the peaks at 2938 and 2870 cm−1 corresponded to the CH2 stretching vibration, and the peaks from 1460 to 1300 cm−1 attributed to the CH2 bending vibration[57]. The peaks observed at 1131, 1007, and 850 cm−1 attributed to the vibration of C-C, C-N, and C-H, respectively. The existing of the above FTIR peaks caused by the addition of ethylenediamine and thiocarbamide in the CdS preparation process. Furthermore, the Cd-S bonds located near 610 cm−1 were the characteristic peak of CdS[31]. For the Co3O4 sample, two sharp peaks at 665 and 565 cm−1 were found, corresponding to the Co-O in Co3O4 [58]. The characteristic peaks of CdS and Co3O4 appear in the FTIR spectra of Co3O4/CdS composites, indicating the Co3O4/CdS composites was consist of CdS and Co3O4, which was similar to the XRD results. To investigate the optical absorption ability of the photocatalyst, the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of CdS, Co3O4, and Co3O4/CdS composites were collected and shown in Fig. 5D. An obvious edge was exhibited in each UV–vis diffuse reflectance curve of CdS and Co3O4/CdS composites. Noticeably, Co3O4/CdS showed a clear red shift of the absorption edge compared with that of Co3O4, while the approximate full absorption spectrum of Co3O4 was observed. The band gap of CdS and Co3O4 calculated as 2.50 and 1.64 eV by the Kubelka-Munk function[59] was shown in Fig. S5 , corresponding to the excellent visible light response of CdS and Co3O4. With the increase of Co3O4 amount in Co3O4/CdS composites, the optical absorption intensity of Co3O4/CdS composites gradually increased within the range of 250–800 nm. Namely, because of the dark color of Co3O4, the optical absorption ability of Co3O4/CdS composites was improved compare with CdS, and the 11%-Co3O4/CdS exhibited the strongest optical absorption in the Co3O4/CdS composites. The increased light absorption of Co3O4/CdS was likely to improve the surface catalytic reactions by converting light energy to heat to activate the catalyst[60]."
15,PL and TRPL,"3.6 PL and TRPL The Photoluminescence spectra of CdS and Co3O4/CdS composites (Fig. 6 A) was used to understand the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes. It is well known that a stronger fluorescence peak means more serious recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes[61]. Compared with the fluorescence peak of CdS, peak of the Co3O4/CdS was blue-shifted from 549 nm to 527 nm, indicating that under the same excitation light, less energy was consumed for the electrons transition of Co3O4/CdS than that of CdS which caused by the promotion of electron transfer by Co3O4/CdS heterojunction[62]. With the increase of Co3O4 amount in the Co3O4/CdS composites, the PL intensity of Co3O4/CdS decreased gradually, because of the form of the heterojunction of Co3O4 and CdS would facilitated the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs[60], and the PL intensity of 11%-Co3O4/CdS was slightly weaker than that of 10%-Co3O4/CdS, because of the decrease of photo-generated electron-hole pairs caused by the increase of Co3O4 content in the Co3O4/CdS composites. To further research the separation of the photo-generated electrons and holes, the fluorescence decay lifetime of CdS and Co3O4/CdS composites was used[62], and the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra was showed in Fig. 6B The TRPL spectra of CdS and Co3O4/CdS composites exhibited the different decay rates of fluorescence, the Co3O4/CdS composites showed faster PL decay rates than that of CdS, and when the Co3O4 amount was 10 wt%, the decay rate of fluorescence was the fastest, indicating the separation of the recombinational photogenerated electron-hole pairs in Co3O4/CdS was optimum at Co3O4 amount of 10 wt%. However, the color of Co3O4 was dark black, it was hard to detect the weak fluorescence peak in the photoluminescence test, which made it very difficult to obtain PL and TRPL spectra. The fluorescence decay spectra of the CdS and Co3O4/CdS composites were fitted triple exponential, and the accurate fluorescence lifetime was calculated by Eqs. (1) and (2) [63]. (1) I t = A 1 exp - t τ 1 + A 2 exp - t τ 2 + A 3 exp - t τ 3 (2) τ = A 1 τ 1 2 + A 2 τ 2 2 + A 3 τ 3 2 A 1 τ 1 + A 2 τ 2 + A 3 τ 3 where, I was the normalized emission intensity, %; τ 1, τ 2, τ 3, and τ is decay lifetime of luminescence, ns; and A 1, A 2, and A 3 is the corresponding weight factors, %. The fluorescence decay lifetime of CdS, 8%-Co3O4/CdS, 9%-Co3O4/CdS, 10%-Co3O4/CdS, and 11%-Co3O4/CdS was 3.58, 2.90, 2.88, 2.55, and 2.69 ns, respectively The fast decay component corresponded to the intrinsic recombination of excitons at direct bandgap, while the medium decay component attributed to the radiative recombination at the surfaces[64]. The upper limit of the electron transfer rate constant (k ET) was calculated by Eq. (3). (3) k ET = 1 τ donor - 1 τ acceptor where, τ (donor) and τ (acceptor) were the mean decay time of Co3O4/CdS and CdS, ns, respectively. The result of fluorescence decay lifetime was shown in Table 2 . 10%-Co3O4/CdS showed the fastest decay lifetime of 2.55 nm, and the biggest electron transfer rate constant of 1.13 × 108 s−1, indicating the increased photo-generatd charge separation rate after the form of heterojunction interface between CdS and Co3O4."
16,Photoelectrochemical properties,"3.7 Photoelectrochemical properties To shed more light on the influences of the p-n heterojunction and the Co-S bond on the separation and transfer of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, the transient photocurrent response and the electrochemical impedance of CdS, Co3O4, and Co3O4/CdS composites were conducted, and the results were shown in Fig. 6C and 6D. As shown in Fig. 6C, the photocurrent of all the samples was relatively low in the dark, and instantaneously increased when the light on. During a 40-second visible light irradiation, the photocurrent density of 10%-Co3O4/CdS was the strongest (5.6 μA∙cm−2), which was about 6 times stronger than that of the CdS (0.9 μA∙cm−2) and 28 times stronger than that of Co3O4 (0.2 μA∙cm−2), indicating that the enhance of photo-generated electron-hole pairs separation in 10%-Co3O4/CdS was caused by the formation of p-n heterojunction and Co-S bond. For 10%-Co3O4/CdS, the photocurrent density during the last light turn-on was kept at 81% of that during the first-time turn-on, indicating separation of photo-generated electrons and holes process was stable. In general, the electrochemical impedance (EIS) was used for accounting the transfer of photo-generated charge carriers in the material, and the bigger arc radius of the Nyquist plot corresponds to the stronger electric charge transfer resistance in the material[60,65,66], specially, the electrochemical impedance is different in the light or dark for semiconductors[67]. As shown in Fig. S6, both CdS and Co3O4 exhibited lower impedance in light than that in darkness, indicating the CdS and the Co3O4 were typical semiconductors. The EIS Nyquist plots of CdS, Co3O4, and Co3O4/CdS composites in the dark in Fig. 6D showed the arc radius of the Co3O4/CdS was smaller than that of CdS and Co3O4 samples, indicating the charge transfer resistance of the Co3O4/CdS composites was lower than that of CdS and Co3O4. Among them, the smallest arc radius of 10%-Co3O4/CdS indicated the fastest transfer rate of photo-generated charge carriers in 10%-Co3O4/CdS. In addition, the linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) curves (Fig. S7) of CdS and 10%-Co3O4/CdS indicated the 10%-Co3O4/CdS exhibited higher cathodic current density for the reduction of H+ to H2 than that of CdS in the dark or light [68–70]. Namely, 10%-Co3O4/CdS showed the excellent reducibility for reduce H+ to H2 under light irradiation. Surface photocurrent (SPV) spectroscopy (Fig. 7 ) was used to study the dynamic behavior of the photo-generated charges at the heterojunction interface by monitoring light-induced surface voltages. The configuration for SPV testing was assembled as “FTO-sample-FTO”, as shown in the inset of Fig. 7. A weak SPV response in 300–500 nm was observed for Co3O4, whereas CdS and Co3O4/CdS showed apparent SPV signals under light irradiation. The SPV signal of 10%-Co3O4/CdS was strongest, which indicated the excitons were created upon light excitation and diffuse through the structure and may reach and become separated at the Co3O4/CdS interface. These results explained these samples possessed large driving forces for triggering interfacial charge carrier movement[71]."
17,Photocatalytic activity,"3.8 Photocatalytic activity Photocatalytic hydrogen production on CdS, Co3O4, and Co3O4/CdS composites was carried out by using Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrifice agent under visible light irradiation (300 W Xe lamp with 420 nm cutoff filter), the results showed in Fig. 8 A and 8B. Obviously, the Co3O4/CdS composites showed superior photocatalytic hydrogen production activity than that of CdS, due to the efficient separation of photo-generated electrons and holes and rapid transfer of photo-generated charge carriers in the Co3O4/CdS heterojunction. Moreover, hydrogen was not observed in the photocatalytic experiment by using Co3O4 as catalyst. Accompanied by the introduction of Co3O4, the hydrogen production rates of the Co3O4/CdS composites increase. When the Co3O4 amount was 10 wt%, the photocatalytic hydrogen production of 142.62 μmol∙h−1 was the highest, which was about 20 times higher than 6.85 μmol∙h−1 of CdS. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 10%-Co3O4/CdS was calculated as 14.16% at 420 nm, and the calculation method and details could be found in Supporting Information. The comparison of photocatalytic hydrogen production results between 10%-Co3O4/CdS and other reported CdS-based photocatalysts were shown in Table S3, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate and AQY of 10%-Co3O4/CdS were higher than other CdS-based photocatalysts, indicating that Co3O4 was a suitable cocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production, and 10%-Co3O4/CdS in the present work exhibited more excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production activity when compared with other similar CdS-based photocatalysts. Furthermore, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of 8%-Co3O4/CdS, 9%-Co3O4, and 11%-Co3O4/CdS were 63.51, 96.17, and 73.28 μmol∙h−1, respectively, and when the supporting Co3O4 amount exceeded 10 wt%, the photocatalytic activity even reduced, because of the CdS was covered by excessive Co3O4 (Fig. 2F), the light absorption and contact with H2O molecules on CdS were limited, which would further inhibit the photocatalytic activity of Co3O4/CdS composites[22,42]. In combination with other characterization analyses, 10%-Co3O4/CdS exhibited excellent light absorption properties and separation properties of photo-generated electrons and holes as verified by the results of UV–vis, PL, TRPL, TPC, and EIS. The Co-S bond on the contact interface between CdS and Co3O4 formed a close heterojunction, which provided different transfer paths for the rapid transfer of electrons and holes, effectively realized the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and improved the photocatalytic activity[22]. In addition, the Co-S bond and p-n heterojunction were formed between CdS and Co3O4 by a simple ultrasonic stirring method. Under the action of ultrasonic cavitation, a large number of microbubbles with local high pressure and local high temperature were generated in the water, and the microbubbles would explode on the photocatalyst surface, resulting in the bending and breaking of the photocatalyst, which generated a piezoelectric field to promote the formation of the p-n heterojunction[72]. Meanwhile, after a 24-hour agitation, the contact between CdS and Co3O4 was increased, which would provide a basis for the formation of the Co-S bonds. Interestingly, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate at the first hour of photocatalytic experiment was significantly lower than that of the next three hours of photocatalytic measurement, which would be studied in the part of cycling experiments."
18,Stability,"3.9 Stability The photocatalytic cycling experiment of the optimal sample, 10%-Co3O4/CdS, on hydrogen production was carried out to research the photocatalytic stability, which was shown in Fig. 8C. The result of the first experiment cycle was consistent with the above photocatalytic hydrogen production experiment, however, the hydrogen production rate of the first hour cycle (67 μmol∙h−1) was lower than that in the following three hours (168 μmol∙h−1). Surprisingly, the subsequent 4 cycles exhibited relatively stable photocatalytic hydrogen production rate: 185.39 (2nd run), 191.90 (3rd run), 180.74 (4th run), and 178.89 μmol∙h−1 (5th run). Namely, after the first hour of the photocatalytic hydrogen production experiment, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate was further increased and remained stable. To get a clearer picture better sense of the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate, the amount of hydrogen production per hour in the 5 cycles was shown in Fig. 8D. Obviously, the stable photocatalytic hydrogen production was observed every hour except for the first hour, which might be cause by irreversible changes, such as the change in the chemical bond, in the first hour of reaction. The photocatalytic activity of 10%-Co3O4/CdS did not decrease within the reaction time, indicating its excellent stability. To further research the stability of 10%-Co3O4/CdS, XRD, SEM, and XPS was conducted to characterize the 5-cycle used 10%-Co3O4/CdS. From the XRD patterns (Fig. S8) and SEM images (Fig. S9), no obvious change can be observed when comparing the used and fresh 10%-Co3O4/CdS, indicating the composition and morphology of the 10%-Co3O4/CdS was maintained after reaction. In the XPS spectrum of Cd 3d (Fig. 9 A), the binding energy of Cd 3d in the 10%-Co3O4/CdS after reaction was the same as that in the 10%-Co3O4/CdS before reaction, and the S 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 9B) showed that the 10%-Co3O4/CdS after reaction exhibited an obvious peak at 168.15 eV in comparison with the10%-Co3O4/CdS before reaction, which originated from the SO3 2- and SO4 2- introduced by the sacrificial agent and adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface[73]. As shown in Fig. 9B, after the reaction, the binding energy of the S 2p in 10%-Co3O4/CdS decreased about 0.1 eV in comparison with that before the reaction. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 9C, the binding energy of the peaks of Co2+ and Co3+ in 10%-Co3O4/CdS increased about 1.6 and 0.4 eV after reaction, respectively. The above change in binding energies of 10%-Co3O4/CdS before and after the reaction indicated that the photo-generated electrons transfer from Co3O4 to CdS[22]. Notably, under visible light irradiation, the chemical state change occurred on the Co-S bond. After photocatalytic reaction the peak area ratio of S 2p (Co-S)/S 2p (CdS) in 10%-Co3O4/CdS was reduced from 0.54 to 0.43, indicating the amount of Co-S bonds decreased but still existed under light irradiation, which could also be observed in the XRD patterns (Fig. S8) of 10%-Co3O4/CdS before and after the reaction. Furthermore, the area ratio of Co2+/Co3+ in the 10%-Co3O4/CdS after reaction decreased in comparison with that before reaction, and the binding energy of two satellites (sat) peaks (centered at 785.9 eV and 802.2 eV)in 10%-Co3O4/CdS after reaction was decreased, corresponding to the conversion of Co3+ to Co2+ and the oxidation state of Co[74,75]. As shown in Fig. 9D, the peak area radio of O-Co (centered at 530.0 eV) to oxygen vacancy (centered at 531.1 eV) in 10%-Co3O4/CdS after reaction decreased from 0.52 to 0.2 in comparison with that before reaction, which indicated the increased oxidation state of Co didn’t exist in the form of O-Co bond. According to the above results of XPS and XRD in 10%-Co3O4/CdS before and after reaction, it could be concluded that the O-Co-S bond was obtained by the oxidation of the Co atom of the Co-S bond, and these bonds led to superior stability and excellent carrier extraction property, realizing the efficient and stable separation of photo-generated electrons and holes[64]. Under visible light irradiation, the Co-S bond was oxidized to the O-Co-S bond instead of the Co-O bond, which further enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production rate. Meanwhile, under irradiation, the Co-S bonds still acted as the bridge of the photogenerated charge transfer and would not be completely converted to the O-Co-S bonds, which makes the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate gradually stable after increasing."
19,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.10 Photocatalytic mechanism To research the photocatalytic mechanism, the band gap (E g) structure of CdS and Co3O4 was measured and calculated. Based on the UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 5D), the E g of CdS and Co3O4 was 2.50 and 1.64 eV according the Kubelka-Munk equation (Fig. S5)[59]. The conduction band and valance band potential of CdS and Co3O4 was further evaluated by the Mott-Schottky curves (Fig. S10), and the results proved that CdS was an n-type semiconductor with a negative slopes of the linear plots, and Co3O4 was a p-type semiconductor with a positive slopes of the linear plots[76]. In addition, the Mott-Schottky curves of 10%-Co3O4/CdS (Fig. S11) exhibited an inverted ‘V-shaped’ profile, indicating the p-n heterojunctions derived from being formed at the p-type Co3O4 and n-type CdS[77]. The flat band potential of CdS and Co3O4 estimated from the intercept of the tangent of the Mott-Schottky curves on the X-axis were −1.67 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, pH = 7) and 1.19 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, pH = 7), respectively. Generally, the flat band potential was commensurate with Fermi level. Meanwhile, the conduction band (CB) potential of n-type CdS semiconductor and the valance band (VB) potential of p-type Co3O4 semiconductor were near the flat band potential[78]. According to Eq. (4), the CB potential of CdS and the VB potential of Co3O4 were converted to −1.06 V (vs NHE, pH = 7) and 1.80 V (vs. NHE, pH = 7), respectively. (4) E vs NHE = E vs Ag/AgCl + E θ vs Ag/AgCl + 0.059 pH (5) E CB = E VB - E g where, the E ϴ(Ag/AgCl, pH = 7) = 0.197 V at 25 °C[57]. According to Eq. (4), the CB potential of CdS and the VB potential of Co3O4 were converted to −1.06 V (vs. NHE, pH = 7) and 1.80 V (vs. NHE, pH = 7), respectively. Based on the E g of CdS andCo3O4 obtained from the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra and Eq. (5), the VB potential of CdS and the CB potential of Co3O4 were calculated to 1.44 V (vs. NHE, pH = 7) and 0.16 (vs. NHE, pH = 7), respectively. The CB and VB potential of semiconductor were also roughly estimated by the Mulliken electronegativity theory (Eq. (6)). The χ values of CdS and Co3O4 were estimated at 5.075 and 5.903 eV, which was the sum of the electronegativity of the all constituent atoms[30]. E e was the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale, which was 4.5 eV[78]. The calculated CB and VB potentials of CdS and Co3O4 listed in Table S2. Lastly, according to the Nernst equation (Eq. (7)), the CB and VB potentials were −1.088 V (vs. NHE, pH = 7) and 1.412 V (vs. NHE, pH = 7) for CdS, and 0.170 V (vs. NHE, pH = 7) and 1.810 V (vs. NHE, pH = 7) for Co3O4 [79]. Obviously, the theoretical calculated values of the band positions were consistent with the experimental measurement values. (6) E VB = χ - E e + 0.5 E g (7) E vs NHE, pH = 7 = E vs NHE, pH = 0 - 0.059 pH where, χ was the electronegativity of the semiconductor. As shown in Fig. 10 A, the band alignment was unable to satisfy photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity due to the less electronegative value of the Co3O4 CB (0.16 V, vs. NHE, pH = 7) than the reduction potential value of water (-0.41 V, vs. NHE, pH = 7). To further research the reasonable band structure, the formation of p-n heterojunction was shown in Fig. 10B. Due to the Fermi levels of CdS was much more negative than that of Co3O4, the electrons from the n‐type CdS flowed into the p-type Co3O4, and the holes transferred from the p-type Co3O4 to the n‐type CdS. Meanwhile, the Co-S bond of Co3O4/CdS was favorable for the transfer of surface electrons and holes. As shown in Fig. 9B, an internal electric field directed from n-type CdS to p-type Co3O4 was built on the interface between CdS and Co3O4, and a balance between the Fermi levels of CdS and Co3O4 was presented, that is, the Fermi level of CdS shifted positively, as well as that of the Co3O4 shifted negatively[29,30,72,77]. Finally, a Co3O4/CdS p-n heterojunction formed as a typical Type II system heterojunction[6]. Furthermore, in the comparison to the binding energies of Co 2p and O 1 s in 10%-Co3O4/CdS before reaction, both of these energy in 10%-Co3O4/CdS after reaction increased, and the binding energy of S 2p in 10%-Co3O4/CdS after reaction decreased, compare with that in 10%-Co3O4/CdS before reaction. The above XPS (Fig. 9) results indicated the photo-generated electrons transfer from Co3O4 to CdS, which further proved the formation of the Type II system heterojunction[22]. The schematic over photocatalytic mechanism over Co3O4/CdS was illustrated as Scheme 1 . Firstly, in the CdS and Co3O4 the photo-generated electrons were excited and leaped from the VB to the CB, and the photo-generated holes were left on the VB under the visible light irradiation[30]. Meanwhile, the photogenerated electron-hole pairs were formed. Secondly, through the p-n heterojunction interface, the photo-generated electrons on the CB of Co3O4 could easily transfer to the CB of CdS and the photo-generated holes could transfer from the VB of CdS to the VB of Co3O4, because of the existing of the Type II system heterojunction and potential difference, and the transfer of the electrons and holes in different directions could effectively avoid the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes. Lastly, the accumulated electrons on the CB of CdS reduce H+ to H2, while the holes on the VB of Co3O4 oxidized S2 2- and SO3 2- to S2O3 2- and SO4 2- [80]. Meanwhile, the built-in electric field and Co-S bond played different roles in the photocatalytic reaction. On the one hand, the internal electric field in the p-n heterojunction could effectively separate the photocatalytic electrons and holes. On the other hand, the Co-S bond acted as the bridge of photogenerated charge transfer to accelerate the photogenerated charge transfer. The increase of photocatalytic hydrogen production rate was due to the synergistic effect of the Co-S bond and internal electric field. The p-n heterojunction and Co-S bond provided the rapid transfer paths in different directions for photo-generated electrons and holes, facilitating the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, and further enhancing the activity of photocatalytic hydrogen production[68]."
20,Conclusion,"Herein, the Co3O4/CdS composites was prepared by ultrasonication and stirring, and applied for photocatalytic water splitting, which showed excellent and stable photocatalytic hydrogen production rate. Confirmed by the results of XPS, XRD and the Raman, the Co-S bonds were formed on the interface between CdS flower-like nanosheets and Co3O4 sheets. The Co-S bond, as a bridge for electron transfer, formed a tight p-n heterojunction, and the addition of Co3O4 greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity of CdS. The optimal photocatalyst, 10%-Co3O4/CdS, showed an excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 142.62 μmol∙h−1, which was 20 times higher than that of CdS (6.85 μmol∙h−1), and the AQY of 10%-Co3O4/CdS was calculated as 14.16% at 420 nm. Co3O4/CdS p-n heterojunction provided different transfer paths for photo-generated electrons and holes, namely, the CB electrons of Co3O4 transfer to the CB of CdS and the VB holes of CdS transfer to the VB of Co3O4 which facilitated the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs and avoided the photo corrosion of CdS. Meanwhile, the Co-S bond provided a bridge for the rapid transfer of electrons between the contact surface of CdS and Co3O4. After the first hour of the photocatalytic reaction, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate was further increased, and remained stable, which caused by the oxidation of Co-S to O-Co-S. The p-n heterojunction and Co-S bond provided the rapid transfer paths in different directions for photo-generated electrons and holes, facilitating the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, and further enhancing the activity of photocatalytic hydrogen production."
