0,Introduction,"While the development of the chemical industry significantly improves the quality of people’s daily life, the contemporaneously raised environmental problems associated with the vast production of different fine chemical products requires more attentions to deal with [1–3]. For example, organic compounds such as rhodamine B, methyl blue, and nitrophenols discharged from factories are serious pollutants in water resources. Among which, nitrophenol compounds, one of the main chemical intermediates widely used in printing and dyeing, pharmaceutical and fertilizer industries [4–6], are hard and toxic chemicals that experience long-term natural degradation time due to their stable structure nature. Therefore, degradation or reutilization of nitrophenol compounds is of great significance in respect to ease their effects to the environment, since random discharge might cause serious environmental pollution, disrupt agricultural development, and cause stunted growth and even cancer to humans [5]. Currently, one of the most effectively way to alleviate the contamination issue from nitrophenols is the chemical transformation to less toxic aminophenol compounds via hydrogenation route [7,8]. On one hand, aminophenol compounds are low in toxicity and colorlessness; and on the other hand, they are also a family of fine and high value-added chemicals. Due to the stable nature of nitrophenol compounds, it is difficult to transfer them to aminophenol products under mild conditions [9,10]. Thus designing a better-performing catalyst, in this respect, is important to improve the whole transformation efficiency since the employed catalyst has a significant influence on the reaction rate during transformation. Currently, noble-metal based nanomaterials (Au, Pd and/or their alloys) have been investigated widely by researchers and some excellent catalytic activity have been achieved under mild conditions [11,12]. However, the high price and scarcity nature of precious metal elements hinder their practical applications in a large scale [13,14]. On contrary, non-noble metal and their oxides derivatives with nanostructure has been emerging as promising alternatives for such applications [15–17]. In particular, copper exhibits unique catalytic behaviors in hydrogenation reactions due to its unique physical and chemical properties [18–20]. For example, the variation on the valence states (0, +1 and ​+ ​2) and low acidic nature endow copper-based catalysts, including metallic copper, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) and copper oxide (CuO) nanocomposites, with excellent activity in the hydrogenation of nitrophenol compounds [21–23]. However, their catalytic activity needs to be further improved in comparison with noble metals, especially under mild conditions. It is generally believed that tailoring the size of metals and/or oxides is beneficial to enhance their catalytic activity [24,25]. However, due to their higher surface energy, smaller particles tend to agglomerate into larger particles, resulting in decreased even deactivation in activities [26,27]. By applying underlying carriers and tuning the metal-supports interaction could not only prevent the agglomeration of metal species but also increase the expose of highly active sites [28–31]. In addition, since the catalytic reaction occurs on the surface of the catalyst, hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the catalyst may have fundamental influence on the adsorption and diffusion of the substrates on the catalyst surface [32–34]. Among supporting materials, SiO2 has been widely used for the preparing of heterogeneous catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, dehydrogenation of alkanes and alcohols, soot combustion and so on [35–38]. More importantly, the presence of abundant oxygen-containing groups (particularly hydroxyl groups) could not only provide sufficient sites for active sites anchoring, but also endow the final catalyst with hydrophilic character, which is beneficial for catalytic reaction particularly in liquid phase. Hence, taking full advantage of SiO2, design and preparation of supported catalysts with hydrophilic surface, although less studied, may be an effective way to further promote reaction kinetics and catalytic performance. Taking the aforementioned factors into account, we designed and prepared a kind of SiO2 material with porous structure and used as the carrier for the preparation of supported copper oxide catalysts (CuO/SiO2). SEM and TEM results revealed that copper oxide particles are anchored on the surface of the silicon oxide substrate. Additionally, because of the abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface of the SiO2, the final catalysts exhibited good hydrophilic property. Catalytic performance of the obtained catalysts has a significant improvement in activity and reaction rate in hydrogenation of nitrophenol compounds under mild conditions. Combined with a series of characterizations, the relationship between the microstructure and catalytic performance of copper-based nanocomposites was established as well."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Copper nitrate hexahydrate (Cu(NO3)2·6H2O), ethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), citric acid, sodium borohydride, nitric acid and commercial copper oxide powder were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai). Nitrophenol compounds were purchased from Aladdin Industries (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were used without further purification. Deionized water in all experiments is self-made in the laboratory."
3,Preparation of SiO2 and CuO/SiO2 catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of SiO2 and CuO/SiO2 catalysts The SiO2 carrier was synthesized based on our previous reports with little modification [39,40]. Typically, 4.3 ​g of citric acid was firstly added to 7.5 ​mL of deionized water and stirred for 15 ​min to prepare a colorless solution. After that, 20 ​mL of TEOS was dropwise added to the above solution. After stirring for another 15 ​min, HNO3 solution was slowly added dropwise to the above mixed solution until the solution became a viscous gel. The obtained gel was dried at 80 ​°C in an oven for 6 ​h, after which the white solid was obtained. Finally, the white solid was ground into powder and calcined in a muffle furnace for 4 ​h to remove the organic template. The obtained support material is denoted as SiO2-x (x represents the thermal treating temperature). The supported copper oxide catalyst was prepared through a wet impregnation method. In a typical procedure, 0.19 ​g Cu(NO3)2·6H2O was firstly dispersed in 15 ​mL deionized water with vigorous stirring. Then 0.5 ​g SiO2 carrier was added into the above solution and stirred for 2 ​h. The mixture was then stirred in a water bath at 80 ​°C until the water was evaporated off. The resultant solid was further dried in an oven at 100 ​°C for 6 ​h. Finally, the as-obtained solid was thermal treated at 400 ​°C for 4 ​h in nitrogen atmosphere in a tube furnace with heating rate of 5 ​°C/min to obtain the final catalyst. For comparison, bare CuO catalyst without addition of SiO2 support was also synthesized using a precipitation method (Fig. S1)."
4,Catalyst characterizations,"2.3 Catalyst characterizations The morphology and microstructure of the as-synthesized catalysts were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, MERLIN Compact) and transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai F20 EM). X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded on Rigaku Powder X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα, k ​= ​1.5418 ​Å). The surface area and pore size distribution of the final catalysts were measured over Micromaterial ASAP 2010 ​N analyzer. The sample was firstly degassed at 150 ​°C for 10 ​h, and the nitrogen adsorption capacity was measured at 77 ​K. Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model was applied for surface area calculation and desorption branch of nitrogen isotherm was used for pore size distribution calculation. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was used to determine the content of Cu speciess in the obtained CuO/SiO2 catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of CuO/SiO2 catalysts were measured on Thermo ESCA LAB 250 system (Mg Kα, 1254.6 ​eV) and Thermo Nicolet IS50, respectively. Shimadzu UV-2700 spectrometer was used to record the UV–vis absorption spectra of the respective reaction solution."
5,Catalytic hydrogenation test,"2.4 Catalytic hydrogenation test Hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) was carried out to evaluate the catalytic performance of the obtained catalysts. In a typical reaction, 0.18 ​g of NaBH4 was added into a 500 ​mL flask containing 300 ​mL 4-nitrophenol solution (22.24 ​mg ​L-1) under stirring (400 ​rpm), leading to an obvious color change from light yellow to yellow green. Then, 20 ​mg of CuO/SiO2 catalyst was added into the above solution to trigger the reaction. During the hydrogenation process, 3 ​mL of the reaction solution was periodically drawn at a given time interval and the absorbance was immediately recorded using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. Benefiting from the hydrophilic nature and high dispersibility in aqueous solution, the concentration of both reactants and catalyst in the reaction solution could be approximately regarded as unchanged after sampling. The change in the absorbance at 400 ​nm (At/A0) was used to evaluate the hydrogenation performance of different catalysts, where At and A0 represent the initial and interval absorbance of the reaction solution. Since the concentration of NaBH4 is much higher than 4-NP during the reaction, according to previous reports [11], a pseudo-first-order kinetics was applied to evaluate the hydrogenation kinetic and the formula ln (At/A0) ​= ​-kt was used to calculate the rate constant over different catalyst. In the activation energy investigation experiment, 10 ​mg of catalyst was used during catalysis, and the reaction activation energy was calculated according to the Arrhenius formula. In the cycle test, the catalyst (10 ​mg) was recovered by centrifugation after each catalytic cycle, washed with deionized water for 3 times, and then used directly in the next cycle."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst composition and morphology characterization,"3.1 Catalyst composition and morphology characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was first used to investigate the crystal structure and composition of the as-synthesized catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1 , no obvious characteristic diffraction peak of SiO2 was found in both CuO/SiO2-500 and CuO/SiO2-800, with only a broad peak appearing at 2θ ​= ​22°. Combined with the previous work [41], it shows that the SiO2 in both samples presents as amorphous structure. For CuO/SiO2-1100, however, obvious characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 29.9°, 31.5°, 36.1° and 42.7° were detected, which can be assigned to the (101), (102), (200) and (211) crystal planes in the cristobalite phase SiO2 (JCPDS card no. 39–1425). The above results prove that the crystallinity degree of SiO2 increases with the increasement of the treating temperature. The inset of Fig. 1 shows the enlarged XRD spectrum from 32° to 42°. It is clearly that two characteristic diffraction peaks at 35.5° and 38.7° are found in all catalysts, which correspond to (11–1) and (111) crystal planes of the CuO phase (JCPDS card no. 48–1548) [42,43], indicating that the copper species exist in the form of copper oxide. The loading amount of Cu species (based on CuO) was 9.8 ​wt%, 9.5 ​wt% and 9.7 ​wt% in CuO/SiO2-500, CuO/SiO2-800 and CuO/SiO2-1100 based on ICP results (Table S1), which is close to the amount of Cu ions added during preparation process. Fig. 2 shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of different samples. Obviously, all the three catalysts exhibit similar morphology and structure, which should be correlated to the same procedure during catalyst preparation. Taking CuO/SiO2-800 as an example, the SiO2 support displays amorphous structure, which is consisted with the XRD results. Interestingly, the copper oxide species in CuO/SiO2-800 present as 50–200 ​nm particles which are uniformly anchored on the surface of SiO2, favorably enhancing the stability of active sites. The SEM element mapping images of CuO/SiO2-800 are shown in Fig. 2d. Apart from the Si and O elements, Cu species from CuO particles was clearly identified on the surface of the CuO/SiO2-800 catalyst. Different from the embedded structure in literature [31], the copper oxide in CuO/SiO2 catalysts is larger in particle size. However, the surface-anchoring structure of CuO species may endow the catalyst with unique advantages, such as ability to facilitate the contact between the substrates and exposes more active species during the catalytic process, thereby improving the final catalytic efficiency. The microstructure of CuO/SiO2-800 is further investigated by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The TEM image in Fig. 3 a clearly confirms that the copper oxide species with 50–200 ​nm in particle size uniformly dispersed in the amorphous SiO2 support, which is in a good agreement with the SEM results. Fig. 3b shows the high-resolution electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the copper oxide species in CuO/SiO2-800. It is interesting to address that unlike the uniform lattice fringes in the bulk oxides [34], the copper oxides in the final catalyst exposes mixed crystal planes. The lattices with periodic spacing of 0.232 ​nm, 0.253 ​nm and 0.275 ​nm could be assigned to cubic CuO (111), (002) and (110) lattice planes, and corresponding reflections could be identified in FTT patterns (Fig. 3b inset). Combined with the XRD results, the above results should be related to the lower crystal phase structure of copper oxides, which may be beneficial to generate and expose more defect sites. Since the catalytic transformation mainly occurs on the surface of catalyst, the surface element composition and chemical environment of metal sites are important factors affecting the catalytic behaviors. Therefore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the electronic properties of CuO/SiO2-800 and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . From the XPS survey spectrum in Fig. 4A, it shows that the catalyst is mainly composed of Si, O and Cu, which is consistent with the SEM mapping results. The Cu 2p XPS spectra is shown in Fig. 4B. Based on the results in previously works, the characteristic peaks at 933.8 ​eV and 953.55 ​eV could be attributed to the core energy levels of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively, indicating that Cu atoms mainly exist in a valence state of +2 [44,45]. And the oxidation state was further confirmed by the two broad satellite peaks at approximately 942.6 ​eV and 962.4 ​eV [46]. In addition, a shoulder peak assigned to copper silicate at 935.7 ​eV was also obtained through peak fitting, which should be generated from the strong interaction between CuO and SiO2 support. Only a broad peak at 103.54 ​eV was detected in the Si 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. S2), which is consisted with the +4 valence of Si in SiO2 crystal phase [41]. As for the O 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 4C), only a broad peak at 529.8 ​eV–531.6 ​eV was detected, which proved the existence of various types of surface oxygen species on the catalyst. Two characteristic peaks can be obtained through peak fitting. According to previous reports, the peak at lower binding energy (530.5 ​eV, peak 1) could be attributed to lattice O species in metal oxides, and the peak with higher binding energy (533.05 ​eV, peak 2) is related to the oxygen in SiO2 and/or surface hydroxyl species on the final catalyst [47,48]. It is obviously that both the intensity and area of peak 2 is higher than that of peak 1, which is consistent with the composition and hydroxy-rich surface of the CuO/SiO2-800 catalyst. Fig. 4D shows the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of CuO/SiO2-800. The characteristic peaks at 1093 ​cm-1, 799 ​cm-1 and 467 ​cm-1 could be attributed to Si–O–Si antisymmetric stretching vibration, Si–O symmetrical stretching vibration and bending vibration [49,50]. Meanwhile, the large peak at 3510 ​cm-1 and shoulder peaks at 958 ​cm-1 could be attributed to the –OH antisymmetric stretching vibration and Si–OH bending vibration on the surface of the catalyst. The above results confirm that abundant hydroxyl species maintained on the surface of catalyst. It is widely accepted the surface hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the catalyst is also important factor for its catalytic activity, therefore we measured the contact angles of water droplets on the obtained catalysts to verify their surface hydrophilicity. As displayed in Fig. 5 , the contact angles of water droplets on the as-synthesized catalysts deposited on glass are all lower than 90°, proving excellent surface hydrophilic characteristics of these catalysts, which may be related to the abundant surface hydroxyl species (Fig. 5 and S3) [32]. Apparently, compared to the contact angle of CuO/SiO2-500 (20°), the contact angle of CuO/SiO2-800 and CuO/SiO2-1100 is smaller (the value is 9° and 10°, respectively), indicating a superior hydrophilicity nature of the catalyst. It could facilitate the contact of the substrates with the surface of active sites and the diffusion on the surface of the catalyst, particular for liquid phase reactions, thus achieving enhanced catalytic performance ultimately. Fig. 6 shows the N2 adsorption-desorption curves and pore size distribution diagrams of different catalysts. Obviously, the N2 adsorption-desorption curves of all samples have both type I and type IV isotherms and hysteresis loop in the relative pressure of 0.45–1.0 (Fig. 6A), indicating that the catalyst has hierarchical pore structure with both micropores and mesopores [51,52]. The pore size distribution results in Fig. 6B reveals that two pores with diameter at 1.5 ​nm and 3–4 ​nm have been obtained in three catalysts, which is consistent with the N2 adsorption-desorption results. The textural parameters of the three catalysts was shown in Table S1 and the surface area meet the trend: CuO/SiO2-1100 (833.2 ​m2 ​g-1) ​> ​CuO/SiO2-800 (427.9 ​m2 ​g-1) ​> ​CuO/SiO2-500 (305.1 ​m2 ​g-1). The large surface area and hierarchical pore structure of the obtained catalysts are beneficial to expose more active sites and promote the diffusion and transport of the substrates during reaction process."
8,Catalytic performance of CuO/SiO2 catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic performance of CuO/SiO2 catalysts To evaluate the catalytic behavior of the as-synthesized catalysts, hydrogenation of nitrophenol to aminophenol was carried out under mild conditions (25 ​°C, 1 ​atm). Similar to the previous work [53,54], sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and water was applied as the reducing medium and solvent during hydrogenation process. Notable, the excellent hydrophilic property of CuO/SiO2 catalyst may be an advantage by improving the adsorption and diffusion of substrate molecules on the catalyst surface. Due to the high kinetic barrier [55,56], negligible conversion of 4-NP was detected without adding any catalyst or over SiO2 supports, either thermal treated at 500 ​°C, 800 ​°C or 1100 ​°C, indicating CuO species is the main active sites for the reaction (Fig. S4). The catalytic performance of different CuO catalysts is shown in Fig. 7 A. Over bulk CuO and CuO/SiO2-500 catalysts, about 75.3% and 83.0% conversions of 4-NP were achieved in 3 ​min reaction. Under the same conditions, however, CuO/SiO2-800 and CuO/SiO2-1100 exhibit superior catalytic performance. The complete conversion of 4-NP on the above two catalysts took only 60 ​s, and high selectivity (>99%) to 4-AP was achieved during reactions. Fig. 7B shows the calculated rate constants of 4-AP hydrogenation over different catalysts. The rate constant (k) over CuO/SiO2-800 is 60.11 ​× ​10-3 s-1, which is about 1.1-, 8.4- and 9.2-times those of CuO/SiO2-1100, CuO/SiO2-500 and bare CuO catalysts (the values are 54.0 ​× ​10-3 s-1, 7.19 ​× ​10-3 s-1 and 6.56 ​× ​10-3 s-1, respectively). For comparison, the hydrogenation performance of 4-NP over metal catalysts in literatures was summarized in Table S2. It shows that the catalytic efficiency of CuO/SiO2-800 is comparable to certain noble metal catalysts, and is obvious higher than that of most non-noble metal catalysts, confirming its relative high efficiency in hydrogenation process. Apart from the superior activity in 4-NP hydrogenation, as shown in Fig. 7C, CuO/SiO2-800 also exhibits excellent activity in catalyzing the hydrogenation of 2-NP and 3-NP. The above-mentioned substrates could be completed reduced within 5 ​min. In addition, the effect of the reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of CuO/SiO2-800 was also evaluated. The catalytic hydrogenation reaction rate increases significantly with the increasement of the reaction temperature, as demonstrated in Fig. S5. Based on the hydrogenation rate constants at different temperature, the activation energy (Ea) of CuO/SiO2-800 for the 4-NP hydrogenation was also calculated. As shown in Fig. 7D, the calculated activation energy of 4-NP hydrogenation over CuO/SiO2-800 is 112.7 ​kJ ​mol-1. Apart from the catalytic activity and selectivity, the stability and recyclability of the heterogeneous catalyst is of great significance to its practical applications. The result of controlled filtration experiment in Fig. S6 show that no continuous conversion of 4-NP was observed after removing CuO/SiO2-800 through filtration, confirming the heterogeneous nature and high stability of the catalyst. In addition, the reusability property of the catalyst was also investigated in the cyclic experiment. As shown in Fig. 8 , CuO/SiO2-800 could maintain relative high activity in at least 8 cycles of hydrogenation reaction, confirming its usage potential in practical application. The reaction time for the complete conversion of 4-NP increases slightly with the number of cycles increases, which may be related to the inevitable loss of catalyst (about 3%) during the recovery process."
9,Hydrogenation mechanism of CuO/SiO2 catalyst,"3.3 Hydrogenation mechanism of CuO/SiO2 catalyst For the 4-NP hydrogenation over heterogeneous catalysts, Qu and co-workers pointed out previously that promote the adsorption of the reactions on the catalyst surface is beneficial to improve the final performance [6]. For the CuO/SiO2-800 catalyst in this work, on one hand, the low-crystallization composition and surface-anchoring structure of copper oxide species could improve the exposure of active sites, which is beneficial to the adsorption and activation of substrate molecules. On the other hand, the hydrophilic surface in CuO/SiO2-800 could further facilitate the contact and diffusion of substrates on the surface of the catalyst. The synergy of unique structure and surface character of CuO/SiO2-800 could overcome the kinetic barrier and promote the charge transfer between substrates, thus achieving enhanced hydrogenation performance. Based on the previous literature and characteristics of CuO/SiO2-800 [57,58], a speculated mechanism is proposed. As shown in Fig. 9 , the substrate molecules of 4-NP and BH4 − are first adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst through electrostatic interaction. Due to the strong electron injection capability of BH4 −, it will transfer electrons to nearby Cu species and release H+ species, forming numerous Cu–H intermediates. Due to the strong reduction ability, the active H species will further attack the –NO2 group in the nearby 4-NP molecular and reduce it to 4-AP. Finally, the desorption of 4-AP will expose the Cu sites and complete the catalytic cycle."
10,Conclusion,"In this work, a series of CuO/SiO2 catalysts were synthesized through impregnation method by applying SiO2 as supports. Benefiting from the large surface area and hierarchical pore structure of the SiO2 support, copper oxide species were uniformly anchored on the surface of the catalyst and exhibited excellent activity in the hydrogenation of nitrophenol. The complete conversion of 4-NP over CuO/SiO2-800 took only 60 ​s, and the hydrogenation rate constant and activation energy were 60.11 ​× ​10-3 s-1 and 112.7 ​kJ ​mol-1, respectively. Eight cycles of hydrogenation could be successfully achieved over CuO/SiO2-800 without significant deactivation, exhibiting the potential in practical applications. The synergy of unique anchor structure and hydrophilic surface should be responsible for the excellent activity and stability in the reaction. This work underlines the importance of microstructure regulation in heterogeneous catalysts, which may be a promising direction for the construction of supported catalysts with outstanding performance."
