0,Introduction,"The development of alternative energy sources is of worldwide interest, due to the limited supply of fossil fuels that presently meet much of our needs. Although many researchers have spared no efforts to obtain alternative fuels for several decades, alternative energy sources are still needed to meet our growing demand. Because hydrogen is the fuel used in highly efficient fuel cells [1] and produces no pollution or greenhouse gases as it generates power, it is an alternative fuel of great interest to many [2]. Some methods for producing hydrogen generate greenhouse gases, but there are methods to capture and sequester the CO2 that is generated. A major challenge to widespread use of hydrogen is the development of cost-effective, environmentally friendly methods for producing hydrogen. Water is a suitable source of hydrogen because it is clean, abundant, and renewable. Water dissociates into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures by the reaction: (1) H 2 O ( g ) ⇔ H 2 + 1 2 O 2 But water splitting without an OTM produces low concentrations of hydrogen and oxygen even at high temperatures (e.g., 0.1 and 0.042%, respectively, at 1600 °C) because the equilibrium constant for the reaction is small [3]. Significant amounts of hydrogen or oxygen can be generated at moderate temperatures, however, if the equilibrium is shifted toward dissociation by removing either oxygen or hydrogen by means of a mixed-conducting, dense, ceramic membrane. For example, an OTM produces hydrogen-enriched steam when oxygen is removed, and additional water dissociates in order to maintain the chemical equilibrium. The oxygen removal rate depends on the membrane's oxygen permeability, the surface oxygen exchange kinetics, and the oxygen partial pressure (pO2) gradient across the membrane [4–8]. The oxygen permeability is closely related to the electron and oxygen-ion conductivities of the OTM. Therefore, to attain a high hydrogen production rate, OTMs should exhibit high electron and oxygen-ion conductivities, possess good surface exchange properties, and be exposed to a high pO2 gradient. A large pO2 gradient can be established by flowing reactive gas (e.g., H2 or CO) on one side of the membrane (with steam on the other side) so that oxygen produced by water splitting is consumed as it diffuses through the OTM. In a study of water dissociation using mixed-conducting ZrO2–TiO2–Y2O3 membranes, Naito and Arashi [9] reported a hydrogen production rate of only ≈0.6 cm3 (STP)/min-cm2 at 1683 °C. This rate was low mainly because of the low electronic conductivity of those membranes. Balachandran et al. [10,11] achieved much higher hydrogen production rates with membranes made from a Ce0.8Gd0.2O2−δ /Ni composite or SrFeCo0.5O x (SFC2), an OTM that was originally developed to form syngas by partial oxidation of methane [12]. Using H2/He gas mixtures as a model reactive gas, Balachandran et al. achieved a hydrogen production rate of ≈10 cm3/min-cm2 at 900 °C [11]. This rate was obtained with thin SFC2 films on porous substrates; however, a phase transition limits the usefulness of SFC2 as an OTM at temperatures below ≈825 °C [13]. The mixed ionic-electronic conducting material, La0.7Sr0.3Cu0.2Fe0.8O3−δ (LSCF7328), because of its unusual electrocatalytic activity [14,15], was originally studied to improve the cathode performance of the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating at intermediate temperature (≤900 °C). The B-site-substituted ferrite compositions, La1−x Sr x M1−y Fe y O3−δ with M = Al [16] and Ni [17], were also studied in attempts to enhance the electrochemical properties of La–Sr–Fe oxides (LSF) below 700 °C. The electrocatalytic activity was enhanced for copper-substituted LSF relative to LSF alone, but not for aluminum- or nickel substituted ferrites. This observation was supported by both cyclic voltammetry and current-potential measurements on complete cells. The cyclic voltammetry data suggested that copper undergoes a one-electron reduction reaction in air, which indicates that LSCF7328 might be useful as a mixed-conducting membrane. For practical application, LSCF7328 must exhibit good mechanical and chemical stability and be easily fabricated by low-cost methods. According to previous electrical conductivity results, LSCF7328 was chemically stable down to an oxygen partial pressure of ∼10−15 atm at 850 °C [15]. We have also found that disk-type LSCF7328 membranes can produce hydrogen via water splitting, described a novel method for fabricating thin-film LSCF7328 membranes on porous LSCF7328 substrates, and demonstrated the effect of a membrane's surface microstructure on its hydrogen production rate [18]. The objective of this study is to reveal the usefulness of a dense, mixed-conducting OTM in boosting hydrogen production. We demonstrate two methods in which an OTM can be used to enhance hydrogen production at moderate temperatures (≤900 °C). In one method, the OTM separates hydrogen and oxygen that are produced by water splitting on the hydrogen-generation side of the OTM. The oxygen on the hydrogen-generation side diffuses through the OTM and is consumed by a reactive gas on the oxygen-permeate side. In the other method, the OTM supplies high-purity oxygen from air to enhance hydrogen production during ethanol reforming. The stoichiometry of the ethanol reforming reaction for maximum hydrogen production is described by the equation: (2) C 2 H 5 OH + H 2 O + O 2 → 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 Ethanol is considered an attractive source of hydrogen because it has high hydrogen content; is non-toxic, renewable, and readily available; and can be easily and safely stored. Due to ethanol's advantages as a hydrogen source, various aspects of hydrogen production by steam reforming of ethanol have been investigated, including the thermodynamics of ethanol reforming [19,20], the effect of catalysts on ethanol reforming [21–24], and the effect of adding oxygen during ethanol reforming in a palladium [25] or Pd–Ag [26,27] membrane reactor that separates the hydrogen as it is produced. In this study, we evaluated the effect of adding high-purity oxygen supplied by an OTM and the effect of mixing steam with ethanol. We anticipated that adding steam reduces coke deposition and increases the hydrogen production by the water–gas shift reaction."
1,Experimental details,
2,Sample preparations,"2.1 Sample preparations LSCF7328 disks: LSCF7328 powder was prepared by conventional solid-state synthesis. The proper amounts of La2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.999%), SrCO3 (Aldrich, 99.9+%), CuO (Johnson Matthey, 99.999%), and Fe2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) were mixed and milled with zirconia balls in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for two days. The dried mixture was preheated at 900 °C for 5 h in air and was ball milled with binder again for overnight. After drying to remove the IPA, the sample powder was pressed at 7000 psi with a 1-in.-diameter die. Dense ceramic discs were obtained by sintering in air at 1150–1190 °C for 24 h. The density of the sintered disks was ∼93.2% of the theoretical density measured by the Archimedes method [18]. LSCF7328 thin-films: LSCF7328 porous substrates were prepared for use as the thin-film support. Employing the same material in both the substrate and thin-film was anticipated to prevent a mismatch in thermal expansion or contraction during either sintering or measurement. A calcined LSCF7328 powder mixed with 20 wt.% carbon was ball milled overnight and dried. Porous substrates were made after firing at 1000 °C for 5 h in ambient air. LSCF7328 thin-films were made by painting an LSCF7328 slurry on the surface of the LSCF7328 substrates. The slurry was prepared by mixing the proper amounts of LSCF7328 powder, binder (poly-vinyl butyral), plasticizer, and α-terpineol (Aldrich). After the slurry was painted with a brush on the substrates, the samples were dried at 80 °C for 1 h and heat treated at 1100–1140 °C for 10 h in air. Before and after the water splitting experiments, the microstructures were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Samples were screened for pinholes and cracks by examining them for penetration by IPA. LSCF7328 tubular membrane: To be practical, OTMs must be available in a shape with a large active area, such as tubes; therefore, we are developing methods for fabricating tubular membranes. Dense, self-supporting LSCF7328 tubes with relatively thick (≈1.5 mm) walls were made by pressing LSCF7328 powder in a cold isostatic press (Engineered Pressure System) in a rubber mold (Trexler Rubber) with a stainless steel mandrel at 10,000–15,000 psig. After pressing, the tube was sintered at 1150 °C for 10 h in air. Tubes produced by this method were typically 4–10 cm in length with an outside diameter of ≈1 cm and a membrane thickness of 0.6–1.6 mm. A tube (O.D. of 1.03 cm, thickness of 0.15 cm, and length of 4.46 cm), open on both ends, was used for our ethanol reforming experiments."
3,Experimental conditions,"2.2 Experimental conditions The hydrogen production rates were measured with thin-film OTM disks in water splitting experiments and with an OTM tube in ethanol reforming experiments. Thin-films and tubular membranes were tested for pinholes and/or microcracks by checking for penetration of the membrane by IPA. The film was considered “dense,” i.e., it contained no interconnected porosity or cracks that could allow gas leakage through the film if IPA applied to one side of the film did not penetrate to the other side, as judged by visual examination. This test was used only to screen out samples with gross defects. The membranes were sealed to the end of an Al2O3 tube with a gold gasket by means of an assembly described elsewhere [28–30]. During the coal gas-assisted water splitting measurements, nitrogen was bubbled through a water bath at a fixed temperature, and then was flowed over one side of the membrane, defined as the hydrogen-generation side. The water's temperature was adjusted to control the water partial pressure (pH2O) on the hydrogen-generation side of the membrane. As a simulation of product streams from coal gasification, CO (99.5% purity) and 50% CO/50% CO2 were flowed over the other side of the membrane, called the oxygen-permeate side. The CO on the oxygen-permeate side reacts with oxygen diffusing through the OTM, thus fixing a low pO2 on the oxygen-permeate side and driving the removal of oxygen from the hydrogen-generation side. A mixture of 80% H2/He was also used as a reactive gas on the oxygen-permeate side to demonstrate that significant quantities of hydrogen can be produced if a large pO2 gradient is established across the OTM. Also, the data obtained using 80% H2/He are good references for comparison with those obtained by coal gas mixtures. A Hewlett–Packard 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) was used to measure hydrogen concentrations in the gas stream at temperatures of 600–900 °C. Gas leakage through the sample and/or seal was quantified by measuring the helium concentration on the hydrogen-generation side. The hydrogen production rate was calculated by subtracting the leakage from the measured hydrogen concentration [31]. Ethanol reforming was studied at 700 °C with an LSCF7328 dense tube and air as the oxygen source. The ethanol partial pressure was fixed at 0.067 atm on one side of the sample by bubbling ultra-high-purity (UHP) He or N2 through absolute alcohol at 23 °C at a flow rate of 200 mL/min. Air was flowed (200 mL/min) on the opposite side of the sample."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Sample characterization,3.1 Sample characterization LSCF7328 thin-film membranes prepared by sintering at 1100–1140 °C for 10 h in air contained several isolated pores but were free from cracks and interconnected porosity. Secondary images of the surface and a fracture surface (Fig. 1 ) show that the sample had a uniform grain size (≤20 μm). X-ray powder patterns of LSCF7328 and its structural behavior under the low pO2 condition (down to ∼6.5 × 10−13 atm) were described previously [15]. The microstructures and the X-ray analysis indicated no evidence of impurities or secondary phases and demonstrated the ease of LSCF7328's preparation and stability in severe gas conditions.
6,Water splitting,"3.2 Water splitting Because the hydrogen production rate through water splitting is directly related to the OTM's oxygen transport rate, we gauged the performance of LSCF7328 as an OTM by comparing its hydrogen production rate to that of SFC2 [13]. The hydrogen production rate for LSCF7328 and SFC2 thin-films was measured at 600–900 °C while flowing humidified nitrogen (pH2O = 0.49 atm) over the hydrogen-generation side of the OTMs and 80% H2/He over the oxygen-permeate side. Each measurement was made after attaining equilibrium for a set of conditions, which typically required about 2 h. Whereas the phase transition for SFC2 caused a sharp drop in hydrogen production rate at temperatures ≤825 °C (Fig. 2 ), the LSCF7328 membrane apparently did not undergo a phase transition under these conditions. Because LSCF7328 does not exhibit a sharp decrease in hydrogen production rate at temperatures ≤825 °C, it is more useful for membrane applications at low temperatures. Although the hydrogen production rate of LSCF7328 dense disks was a little lower than that of other OTM materials, e.g., SFC2 and CGO/Ni [18], the hydrogen production rates of thin-film LSCF7328 and SFC2 samples were similar at high temperature (>825 °C), even though the LSCF7328 film was considerably thicker (50 μm for LSCF7328 vs. 20 μm for SFC2). At temperature <825 °C, the hydrogen production rate of the LSCF7328 film was even several times higher than that of SFC2. Fig. 3 shows the hydrogen production rates versus pH2O on the hydrogen-generation side of an LSCF7328 thin-film (film thickness ≈22 μm) in tests using three reactive gases on the oxygen-permeate side of the membrane: CO (99.5% purity), 50% CO/50% CO2, and 80% H2/He. The flow rate of gas on both the hydrogen-generation side (UHP nitrogen bubbled through water) and oxygen-permeate side (H2/He, CO, or CO/CO2) was 150 mL/min. The pH2O on the hydrogen-generation side was controlled by the temperature of the water bath. For all three reactive gases on the oxygen-permeate side, the hydrogen production rate increased as pH2O increased on the hydrogen-generation side. This trend is reasonable because the increase in pH2O increased the oxygen chemical potential gradient across the membrane, which increased the rate of oxygen removal from the hydrogen-generation side [10,11]. As the gas on the oxygen-permeate side was changed from 80% H2/He to CO (99.5% purity), and then 50% CO/50% CO2, the hydrogen production rates decreased, because the driving force for oxygen diffusion through the membrane decreased. In turn, this driving force decreased because the oxygen chemical potential increased on the oxygen-permeate side of the tube. The hydrogen production rates were ≈9.0, ≈4.7, and ≈1.2 cm3/min-cm2 for 80% H2/He, CO (99.5% purity), and 50% CO/50% CO2, respectively, in a test at 900 °C with a gas containing 49 vol% water vapor on the hydrogen-generation side. The thicknesses of the film and substrate were ≈22 μm and ≈2.70 mm, respectively. These results were reproducible with different batches of samples. The hydrogen production rate for the LSCF7328 thin-film is plotted (Fig. 4 ) versus the CO concentration on the oxygen-permeate side of the membrane for various temperatures. The CO concentration was balanced with either CO2 or He for measurements at 600 and 900 °C, but was balanced with only CO2 for measurements at 700 and 800 °C. Dissociation of CO2 increased the pO2 in the CO/CO2 mixtures, relative to CO/He mixtures with the same nominal CO concentration; consequently, the driving force for oxygen diffusion through the membrane was smaller with a CO/CO2 mixture on the oxygen-permeate side. As a result, a CO/CO2 mixture on the oxygen-permeate side gave a smaller hydrogen production rate than did a CO/He mixture with the same nominal CO concentration. Fig. 5 shows the hydrogen production rate of the LSCF7328 thin-film membrane versus reciprocal temperature for various CO concentrations on its oxygen-permeate side. With CO (99.5% purity) flowing on the oxygen-permeate side, a hydrogen production rate of ≈4.7 cm3/min-cm2 was measured at 900 °C. This finding suggests that hydrogen could be produced by product streams from coal gasification, which would drive the dissociation of water. As the CO concentration decreased on the oxygen-permeate side, the pO2 increased, causing a decrease in the driving force for oxygen diffusion from the hydrogen-generation side of the film. As a result, the hydrogen production rate decreased as the CO concentration decreased. Because oxygen diffusion is thermally activated, the hydrogen production rate decreased as temperature decreased with, an apparent activation energy of ≈0.92 eV. To verify that different LSCF7328 thin-films give reproducible results, the hydrogen production rate was measured under “standard” water splitting conditions for two films. During these measurements at 900 °C, humidified N2 (pH2O = 0.49 atm) was flowed on the hydrogen-generation side, while 80% H2/He was flowed on the oxygen-permeate side, both gases flowing at a rate of 150 mL/min. One film gave a hydrogen production rate of 9.0 cm3/min-cm2 while the other film gave a rate of 9.8 cm3/min-cm2. The similarity of these values indicates that the properties of the LSCF7328 films are reproducible."
7,Ethanol reforming using OTMs,"3.3 Ethanol reforming using OTMs Ethanol reforming was studied at 700 °C in tests using an LSCF7328 tube (surface area ≈10.2 cm2) as an OTM and air as the oxygen source. The ethanol partial pressure (pEtOH) was fixed at 0.067 atm on the inside of the tube by bubbling UHP He or N2 through absolute ethanol at 23 °C, while air was flowed on the outside of the tube. Both gases flowed at a rate of 200 mL/min during the measurement. A gas-tight seal was made at 900 °C, and then the temperature was decreased to 700 °C for the ethanol reforming experiment. The products from ethanol reforming included H2, CO, CH4, CO2, C2H4, acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), and a trace of C2H6. Water and un-reacted ethanol were also detected in the product stream, but their measured concentrations were somewhat uncertain due to the possibility of their condensation between the reactor and the GC. Fig. 6 compares the product formation rates during two ethanol reforming experiments at 700 °C. In one experiment, ethanol reforming was done inside an LSCF7328 tube that supplied oxygen for reforming from air flowing on the outside of the tube. In the other experiment, a “blank” test to clarify the effect of permeated oxygen, ethanol reforming was done in the same reactor, but the OTM was replaced by dense, oxygen-impermeable Al2O3. The hydrogen formation rate with the OTM was approximately twice that with the Al2O3 blank. Whereas the CO2 formation rate was negligible in the blank test, and the CO and acetaldehyde formation rates were small, the formation rates of CO, CO2, and acetaldehyde all increased significantly in the test with the OTM. The formation rates for the other detectable components (H2O, CH4, and C2H4) also increased when the OTM was present, and the amount of un-reacted ethanol in the product stream was only half that in the blank test. The higher formation rates for the products and the smaller concentration of un-reacted ethanol clearly show that oxygen supplied by the OTM enhanced ethanol reforming. Although the formation rate of ethylene (C2H4), which was formed by dehydration of ethanol, was not high, its presence is highly undesirable because ethylene is a precursor to coke formation and may lead to catalyst deactivation [32]. The increased CO, CO2, and H2 formation rates may be attributed to the steam reforming and the water–gas shift reactions that take place simultaneously in the reactor. After the blank test, small amounts of coke were found inside the reactor. Coke deposition can cause deactivation of catalysts and deterioration of the membrane. Because addition of steam can reduce coke formation, ethanol reforming at 700 °C was studied in tests using steam/ethanol mixtures in the range from 0/1 to 5/1. As before, ethanol reforming experiments were conducted with an OTM or with an oxygen-impermeable Al2O3 tube as a reference. Whether the test was done with an OTM or oxygen-impermeable Al2O3, a catalyst was not used. Steam/ethanol mixtures that flowed inside the OTM tube were prepared by mixing two streams of He or N2, one saturated with ethanol at room temperature (23 °C), and the other saturated with steam at a controlled temperature (38.5–72.1 °C). Each stream flowed at a rate of 100 mL/min, giving a total flow rate of 200 mL/min on the reforming side. Air flowed outside of the OTM tube, also at a rate of 200 mL/min. Table 1 summarizes the test conditions that were used in varying the steam/ethanol ratio, and Fig. 7 shows the effect of the steam/ethanol ratio on the hydrogen formation rate. The hydrogen formation rate generally increased as the water/ethanol ratio increased, as reported by Fatsikostas et al. [33], due to the water–gas shift reaction and the absence of coke formation. In the blank experiment, the hydrogen formation rate increased the most as the steam/ethanol ratio increased to 3/1 and increased only slightly more as the steam/ethanol ratio increased to 5/1. The corresponding ethanol conversion rates (Table 1) were calculated from the input and the output amounts of ethanol. The ethanol conversion rates of a blank were ≈25.2% for a steam/ethanol ratio of 0/1 and ≈51.6% for a ratio of 3/1. When the OTM tube was used, the conversion rate increased to 57.3% and 58.7%, respectively. Liguras et al. [32] reported an ethanol conversion rate of ≈48% for steam reforming of ethanol with H2O/EtOH = 3/1 at 700 °C using 1% Rh/Al2O3 catalyst. The hydrogen formation rate with the OTM tube was measured with steam/ethanol ratios of 0/1 and 3/1 and pEtOH = 0.067 atm. Under both conditions, the hydrogen formation rate with the OTM was twice as high as that obtained from blank measurements. When pEtOH was doubled to 0.135 atm (with a steam/ethanol ratio of 0/1), the hydrogen formation rate with the OTM tube increased, from ≈0.7 mL/min to ≈1.7 mL/min. A blank experiment was not done under these conditions. The results of this study clearly show that an OTM can enhance hydrogen production during ethanol reforming, but several findings indicate that the process is far from optimum. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that H2, CO, CO2, CH4, and small amounts of coke should be the only products from ethanol reforming with a steam/ethanol ratio of 0/1; however, considerable amounts of acetaldehyde, ethylene, and coke were also formed as products. In order to decrease the formation of coke and other byproducts while increasing the hydrogen formation rate and selectivity during reforming with an OTM, we are exploring several modifications. For example, we are decreasing the OTM's thickness and increasing its area to increase the amount of oxygen that is injected during reforming. Also being tried are tubular-type thin-film membranes for larger active area, different steam/ethanol ratios, and a rhodium-based catalyst on the OTM. We are also exploring other methods for introducing ethanol vapor into the reactor so that it contacts the OTM before it decomposes. In this way, oxygen from the OTM would interact with un-reacted ethanol rather than the products of decomposition."
8,Conclusions,"The results from this study demonstrate that LSCF7328 is a good candidate material as an OTM that can produce hydrogen through both water splitting and ethanol reforming. LSCF7328 membranes were easily prepared by conventional ceramic processing technique, and they exhibited good mechanical and chemical stability under the extreme conditions of this study. We demonstrated two methods by which an LSCF7328 OTM could be used to produce hydrogen. In tests with LSCF7328 thin-film membranes at 900 °C using CO (99.5% purity) to drive the process, water splitting produced hydrogen at a rate of ≈4.7 cm3/min-cm2. Using product streams from coal gasification would yield high-purity hydrogen on one side of the membrane and a CO2-rich stream ready for sequestration on the other side. In another test using a dense LSCF7328 tube, ethanol conversion and hydrogen production were increased by using the OTM to supply oxygen from air."
