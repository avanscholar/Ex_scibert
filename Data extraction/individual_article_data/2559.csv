0,Introduction,"Gluconobacter oxydans, a gram-negative and obligate aerobic bacterium belonging to acetic acid bacteria, can rapidly and completely oxidize a wide range of sugar and sugar alcohols with low biomass, accumulating the corresponding oxidation products in large amounts (De Ley et al., 1984; Prust et al., 2005). The oxidation reactions are catalyzed by numerous membrane-bound dehydrogenases which are located on the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane and linked to the respiratory chain (Prust et al., 2005). The high oxidation rate usually causes a high demand for oxygen, and the oxidation products accumulate in the culture medium, often resulting in its acidification (Hanke et al., 2012). The PQQ-containing membrane-bound alcohol dehydrogenase (mADH) is one of these key dehydrogenases in G. oxydans and catalyzes the oxidation of primary alcohols and diols to the corresponding acids or hydroxy acids (Wei et al., 2013). When oxidizing a substrate, electrons are transferred through the cytochrome c site of subunit I (heme I) to the subunit II through heme II1, then to heme II2 and finally to ubiquinone (Matsushita et al., 1996). The respiratory chain of G. oxydans contains two ubiquinol oxidases, bo3 and bd (Prust et al., 2005). The bo3 ubiquinol oxidase has a significantly higher oxygen affinity than the bd ubiquinol oxidase and plays a major role for the build-up of proton motive force and biomass formation, probably functioning as a rate-limiting factor of the respiratory (Miura et al., 2013; Richhardt et al., 2013). The bd oxidase route, a non-energy generating and cyanide-resistant bypass oxidase pathway, could be used to keep oxidation of substrates at a high speed in acidic environments (Matsushita et al., 1989; Miura et al., 2013; Tkac et al., 2009). Based on earlier studies, a mutant of G. oxydans lacking the subunit II of mADH shows relatively less cyanide resistance in the respiratory chain (Matsushita et al., 1991), yet under acidic conditions the amounts of subunit II are elevated parallel with the increase in the cyanide-resistant respiratory (Matsushita et al., 1989). These indicate that mADH might be related to the cyanide-resistant bypass respiratory chain. Furthermore, mADH has another physiological role in the respiratory chain of G. oxydans. It mediates the electron transfer from another primary membrane-bound d-glucose dehydrogenase (mGDH) through the subunit II of mADH to ubiquinone and finally to oxygen (Shinagawa et al., 1990). In our previous studies, three subunits (AdhA, AdhB and AdhS) of mADH were characterized, and overexpression of adhABS genes was found to effectively increase the mADH activity toward ethylene glycol to glycolic acid (Wei et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2016). Glycolic acid is the smallest member of the α-hydroxy acid family, and widely used for the leather industry, the oil and gas industry, the laundry and textile industry and medical application, e.g., poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-based drug delivery systems (Fredenberg et al., 2011; Kataoka et al., 2001; Koivistoinen et al., 2013). Glycolic acid is naturally produced by bioconversion of glycolonitrile using microbial nitrilases (He et al., 2010), but glycolonitrile and its degradation products formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide are toxic. Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered for glycolic acid production from glucose via the glyoxylate shunt stably with the highest titer up to 56.44gl−1 (Deng et al., 2015). Koivistoinen et al. (2013) engineered yeasts to produce glycolic acid at 15gl−1 using d-xylose and ethanol as substrates. Corynebacterium glutamicum has been reported to be capable of glycolic acid production (Zahoor et al., 2014), and chemolithotrophic iron- and sulphur oxidizing bacteria are also used for producing glycolic acid (Ñancucheo and Johnson, 2010). Ethylene glycol is one of the cheap starting materials for glycolic acid production. Based on previous studies, Pichia naganishii AKU 4267 and Rhodotorula sp. 3Pr-126 could produce 105 and 110gl−1 glycolic acid from ethylene glycol, with the space-time yield of 0.88 and 0.92gl−1 h−1, respectively (Kataoka et al., 2001). Gao et al. (2014) reported that Burkholderia sp. EG13 showed high potential application in the synthesis of glycolic acid from ethylene glycol, but only about 60gl−1 glycolic acid could be obtained after 120h of bioconversion. The activity toward ethylene glycol of these strains was not high enough and thus the titer of glycolic acid from the above methods was very low. G. oxydans DSM 2003 was reported for the production of glycolic acid from ethylene glycol in an integrated bioprocess (Wei et al., 2009b). It found that 20gl−1 ethylene glycol could inhibit the activity of resting cells. Accordingly, fed-batch bioconversion of ethylene glycol was carried out, and the highest concentration of glycolic acid was 74.5gl−1. To reduce the end-product inhibition, Wei et al. (2009b) developed an in situ product removal (ISPR) technique, which used anion exchange resin D315 as the adsorbent for selective removal of glycolic acid. This approach allowed the yield of glycolic acid to be increased to 93.2gl−1, with the space-time yield of 1.86gl−1 h−1. However, there were still some limitations in the ISPR system due to the extraction power of the resin and the loss of cell activity. In this study, we investigated the effects of overexpression of mADH in G. oxydans DSM 2003 on biochemical and genetic features, leading to improved cell growth and accelerated respiratory rates. The biosynthesis of glycolic acid from ethylene glycol by the mADH overexpression strain was also performed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacterial strains and growth conditions,"2.1 Bacterial strains and growth conditions G. oxydans DSM 2003 belonged to the culture collection of our laboratory. Construction of the mADH overexpression strain G. oxydans-adhABS and the control strain G. oxydans-pBBR1MCS5 were described in our recent study (Zhang et al., 2016). G. oxydans strains were cultivated at 30°C in shake flasks or a 7L bioreactor in sorbitol medium, consisting of 80gl−1 sorbitol, 20gl−1 yeast extract, 1gl−1 KH2PO4, 0.5gl−1 MgSO4·7H2O, and 0.1gl−1 glutamine with initial pH 6.0. When cultivated in a bioreactor, agitation and aeration rates were regulated at either 400rpm and 0.6 vvm for low aeration conditions or 600rpm and 1.2 vvm for high aeration conditions, with pH value and temperature maintained at 6.0 and 30°C automatically. The optical density at 600nm (OD600) of cultures was measured to monitor cell growth, which was converted into dry cell weight (DCW) using the relation of 1 OD600 =0.463g DCWl−1."
3,Quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR,"2.2 Quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR Quantitative real-time polymerasechain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed to investigate the transcriptional abundance of the overexpression strain. To minimize the effect of the growth state on qRT-PCR analysis, bacterial cells that used for RNA isolation were cultured for approximately 18h in sorbitol medium. Total RNA was extracted using RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and treated with DNase I (TaKaRa) to eliminate any residual genomic DNA. The concentration of each RNA sample was quantified by NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). cDNA was synthesized using PrimerScript 1st strand cDNA synthesis kit (TaKaRa) by following manufacturer’s instructions. All primers used for qRT-PCR in this study were designed with Primer 5.0 (Table 1 ). The quantitative expression analysis of target genes was performed using StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The 16S rRNA gene, known as a housekeeping gene, was used as internal standard. Samples were run in triplicate with appropriate controls, and data were analyzed by the 2−ΔΔCt method."
4,Preparation of the membrane fractions,"2.3 Preparation of the membrane fractions The G. oxydans cells were harvested as described above, and washed twice with ice-cold 50mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1mM MgCl2. The washed cells were resuspended with the same buffer at a cell wet weight concentration of 0.2gl−1 and passed twice through a French pressure cell press (Union-Biotech, Shanghai, China) at 14000psi. After centrifugation at 8000× g for 15min to remove the cell debris, the supernatants were centrifuged at 40000× g for 60min. The precipitate was resuspended with 10mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) subsequently and used as the membrane fractions. Protein content was measured by the method of Bradford (1976), using bovine serum albumin as a standard."
5,Enzyme assay,"2.4 Enzyme assay The dehydrogenase activity in the cytoplasmic membrane was determined at 30°C by measuring the initial reduction rate of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (2,6-DCIP, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States) at 600nm on a SpectraMax 190 instrument (Molecular Devices, California, United States). The basal reaction mixture consisted of 5mM DCIP and 6.5mM phenazine methosulfate (PMS, Sigma) in 50mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). The reaction mixtures (200μl) for enzyme assay containing 80μl of basal reaction mixture and 0.03mg of protein in 50mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) was incubated at 30°C for 5min, and the reactions were started by adding 50mM substrates (benzaldehyde, meso-erythritol, d-glucose, and d-gluconate). One unit of the dehydrogenase activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of 1μM DCIP per min at 30°C. The molar extinction coefficient of DCIP at pH 6.0 was 10.8mM−1 (Sugisawa and Hoshino, 2002)."
6,Oxygen uptake rate measurement,"2.5 Oxygen uptake rate measurement Oxygen uptake rates (OURs) were measured under high aeration condition by dynamic gassing-out method as previously described (Bandyopadhyay et al., 1967; Li et al., 2010). The airflow to the reactor was interrupted with simultaneous reduction in the agitation rate to 100rpm, minimizing the effects of surface aeration. The decrease in dissolved oxygen (DO) was determined by a Mettler polarographic probe. Aeration and agitation were returned to normal before the DO values reached critically low values. The volumetric DO concentration was determined with the assumption of maximum solubility of O2 under stirred-tank conditions, and equilibrium (100% saturation) 8mgl−1. The OURs were expressed as milligram of oxygen consumed per gram DCW per minute."
7,Batch bioconversion of ethylene glycol to glycolic acid,"2.6 Batch bioconversion of ethylene glycol to glycolic acid For the preparation of resting cells, the G. oxydans strains were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C after 24h of culture in sorbitol medium, washed twice with 100mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), and resuspended in the same buffer. The catalytic oxidation of ethylene glycol using different resting cells was carried out in a 7L bioreactor with 2L working volume. The reaction system, consisting of 20gl−1 bacterial cells (wet weight) and 40gl−1 ethylene glycol, was incubated at 28°C and 600rpm for 24h. The pH was controlled at 5.5 by automatic addition of 4M NaOH. Reaction samples were collected at regular intervals to determine the concentration of glycolic acid."
8,Fed-batch bioconversion of ethylene glycol to glycolic acid,"2.7 Fed-batch bioconversion of ethylene glycol to glycolic acid The fed-batch bioconversion of ethylene glycol was also carried out in a 7L bioreactor with 2L working volume. The reaction system, consisting of 20gl−1 bacterial cells (wet weight), was incubated at 28°C and 600rpm for 45h. The concentration of ethylene glycol was kept at approximately 20gl−1 in a fed-batch mode. The pH was controlled at 5.5 by automatic addition of 8M NaOH. Reaction samples were collected at regular intervals to determine the concentration of ethylene glycol and glycolic acid."
9,Fed-batch fermentation of ethylene glycol for glycolic acid production,"2.8 Fed-batch fermentation of ethylene glycol for glycolic acid production The G. oxydans strains were cultivated in a 7L bioreactor with 4L sorbitol medium (40gl−1 sorbitol, 20gl−1 yeast extract, 1gl−1 KH2PO4, 0.5gl−1 MgSO4·7H2O, and 0.1gl−1 glutamine) and 10% inoculation scale. Ethylene glycol was added in five portions, and the final concentration was 100gl−1. The fermentation process was performed at pH 5.5, 28°C, 600rpm and 1.2vvm for 45h. The pH was automatically controlled by addition of 8M NaOH. Reaction samples were collected at regular intervals to determine the cell density and glycolic acid production."
10,Analytical methods,"2.9 Analytical methods The concentration of d-sorbitol was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) HP1200 system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a high-sensitivity refractive index (RI) detection after filtration and dilution of samples. The substances were separated by Sugar-Pak™ 1 column (6.5mm×300mm; Waters) at 80°C, using distilled water as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5mlmin−1. The concentration of glycolic acid was measured by HPLC (HP1100, Agilent) equipped with Zorbax SB-aq (4.6mm×250mm; Agilent) according to the method described previously (Wei et al., 2009a). Ethylene glycol was analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a capillary column HP-5 (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm; Agilent). The operation parameters were: injection temperature, 250°C; detector temperature, 280°C; the initial oven temperature was kept at 100°C for 2min, and then increased to 150°C with a rate of 10°Cmin−1, maintained for 1min. Molar yield (%) was calculated as (molar amount of product/total molar amount of substrate)×100%."
11,Results,
12,Growth phenotypes of mADH overexpression strain,"3.1 Growth phenotypes of mADH overexpression strain Fig. 1 A shows the growth of the engineered strain G. oxydans-adhABS in sorbitol medium when cultivated in shake flasks with initial pH 6.0. G. oxydans-adhABS grew slower in exponential phase than the control strain G. oxydans-pBBR1MCS5, and showed a faster decrease in pH. After 24h of culture, the pH value of G. oxydans-adhABS dropped from 6.0 to 4.1, much lower than that of the control (pH 5.0). These results suggested that the overproduced mADH improved the acid-producing ability of G. oxydans-adhABS, leading to an increased acidification of the medium, which probably inhibited the bacterial growth in exponential phase. However, the final DCW of G. oxydans-adhABS was pretty much the same as the control, indicating that G. oxydans-adhABS exhibited some assistance to acid. To further investigate the effects of mADH overexpression on cell growth, the scale-up culture of G. oxydans-adhABS under low and high aeration conditions was performed in a 7L bioreactor. During the whole cultivation process, the pH value and temperature were maintained at 6.0 and 30°C automatically. As shown in Fig. 1B, under low aeration conditions, G. oxydans-adhABS showed the similar profile of cell growth to the control, but grew a little faster. After 36h of culture, the final DCW reached 2.4gl−1, 33% higher than that of the control. High aeration could stimulate cell growth. Under high aeration conditions, the final DCW of G. oxydans-adhABS strain reached 5.0gl−1, 26% higher than that of the control. These results meant that overexpression of mADH in G. oxydans DSM2003 was beneficial to increase cell growth."
13,Effects of mADH overexpression on the respiratory chain in G. oxydans,"3.2 Effects of mADH overexpression on the respiratory chain in G. oxydans Previous study demonstrated that acetic acid bacteria pump out acetic acid by an efflux pump which is energized by the proton motive force produced by respiratory (Matsushita et al., 2005). It was reasonable to presume that the excess acid produced in G. oxydans-adhABS might need a bigger energy pool for potential acid export system and increase the demand for oxygen. To know the effects of mADH overexpression on the respiratory chain, the relative transcription levels of respiratory chain-related enzyme genes in G. oxydans-adhABS were measured by qRT-PCR, and the results roughly confirmed our hypothesis. Fig. 2 A shows that the transcription levels of the enzyme genes except ndh in the respiratory chain were significantly up-regulated in G. oxydans-adhABS. Particularly the cyoD gene encoding cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase, which is responsible for transferring electrons from ubiquinol to oxygen, increased by 13.4-fold compared to the control. The results confirmed the previous findings that cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase played a major role for the build-up of proton motive force (Richhardt et al., 2013). The cydA gene encoding cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase in G. oxydans-adhABS was 3.8-fold higher than that in the control strain, indicating that mADH overexpression of G. oxydans might show more cyanide resistance in the respiratory chain. It was suggested that the expression of cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase might be related with the amount of mADH. A previous study showed that cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase was closely related with the rapid oxidation of substrates under acidic conditions (Miura et al., 2013). Thus, the increased amount of cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase in G. oxydans-adhABS might be partly responsible for the increased mADH activity. To determine whether the up-regulated enzyme genes in the respiratory chain correlated to accelerated respiratory rate, OUR of the engineered strain G. oxydans-adhABS was measured under high aeration conditions (Fig. 2B). With an increase in cell yield, the total oxygen demand of cell growth increased and apparently reached a threshold value. G. oxydans-adhABS showed a higher OUR and attained a peak value of 3.81mgg−1 min−1 at 12h, 32.3% higher than that of the control (2.88mgg−1 min−1). The data revealed that the respiratory rate in G. oxydans-adhABS increased during growth phase, probably resulting from the up-regulated respiratory chain. Furthermore, the concentration of carbon source in the fermentation process was also determined. As shown in Fig. 2B, the consumption of sorbitol by the engineered strain G. oxydans-adhABS was faster than that by the control strain, which was coincident with the increased OUR and cell growth."
14,Effects of mADH overexpression on the activities of membrane-bound dehydrogenases,"3.3 Effects of mADH overexpression on the activities of membrane-bound dehydrogenases Shinagawa et al. reported that the electron transfer from mGDH to ferricyanide was mediated by mADH in G. suboxydans (Shinagawa et al., 1990). The influence of mADH overexpression on the expression and activity of other primary membrane-bound dehydrogenases was further investigated. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the transcription levels of genes encoding membrane-bound aldehyde dehydrogenase (mALDH), membrane-bound sorbitol dehydrogenase (mGLDH), mGDH and membrane-bound 2-keto-d-gluconate dehydrogenase (GA-2-DH) in G. oxydans-adhABS were increased by 5.2-, 5.9-, 4.3-, and 5.6-fold, respectively. Previous studies have demonstrated that mALDH, mGLDH, mGDH, and GA-2-DH are responsible for the oxidation of benzaldehyde to benzoic acid, meso-erythritol to erythrulose, d-glucose to d-gluconate, and d-gluconate to 2-keto-d-gluconate, respectively (Ameyama et al., 1981; Shinagawa et al., 1984; Voss et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011). Enzyme assays indicated that the relative activities of mALDH, mGLDH, mGDH, and GA-2-DH in G. oxydans-adhABS were 1.26-, 1.36-, 1.14-, and 1.39-fold higher in comparison to the control (Fig. 3B). The results revealed that overexpression of mADH in G. oxydans DSM2003 could not only increase the mADH activity, but also help improve the activities of other membrane-bound dehydrogenases to some extent."
15,Biosynthesis of glycolic acid from ethylene glycol by G. oxydans-adhABS,"3.4 Biosynthesis of glycolic acid from ethylene glycol by G. oxydans-adhABS Considering the improved activity of mADH toward ethylene glycol to glycolic acid and accelerated respiratory rates, the potential application of G. oxydans-adhABS in biosynthesis of glycolic acid was evaluated during the whole-cells catalyzed bioconversion and fed-batch fermentation process. Bioconversion of ethylene glycol was performed in a 7L bioreactor with pH control and continuous high oxygen supply. As shown in Fig. 4 A, after 24h of bioconversion, G. oxydans-adhABS produced 33gl−1 glycolic acid with a molar yield of 67.4% and a space-time yield of 1.38gl−1 h−1, while the control strain G. oxydans-pBBR1MCS5 produced 18.2gl−1 glycolic acid with a yield of 37.2% and a space-time yield of 0.76gl−1 h−1. The results showed that overexpression of mADH could accelerate the oxidative reaction and improve glycolic acid production by 81.3%, but product titer was still relatively low. To reduce the substrate inhibition, fed-batch bioconversion of ethylene glycol by G. oxydans-adhABS was carried out in a 7L bioreactor, and the concentration of ethylene glycol was maintained at approximately 20gl−1 in a fed-batch mode (Wei et al., 2009b). As shown in Fig. 4B, the activity of resting cells was very high at early stage of reaction, and the highest concentration of glycolic acid reached 73.3gl−1 at 45h, with a molar yield 93.5% and a space-time yield of 1.63gl−1 h−1. For batch bioconversion, resting cells need to be prepared beforehand on a large scale. By comparison, batch fermentation could effectively simplify the production process and reduce the production period and cost. To further assess the potential industrial use of G. oxydans-adhABS for glycolic acid production, the fermentation process of ethylene glycol was studied in a 7L bioreactor. The initial concentration of ethylene glycol was 20gl−1, to reduce the substrate inhibition and probably help induce the mADH activity (Chinnawirotpisan et al., 2003). Ethylene glycol was added at different time in fermentation process, and the final concentration of ethylene glycol was 100gl−1. As shown in Fig. 4C, both the control strain G. oxydans-pBBR1MCS5 and G. oxydans-adhABS showed the similar profiles of cell growth to the cultivation experiment under high aeration conditions (as shown in Fig. 1B); however, substrate and product existing in the culture medium had negative influence on growth, resulting in a lower growth yield. The final DCW of G. oxydans-adhABS reached 3.2gl−1 at 36h, 32.7% higher than that of the control. The increased cell mass could provide more biocatalyst for glycolic acid production. After 45h of culture, G. oxydans-adhABS produced 113.8gl−1 glycolic acid with a molar yield of 92.9%, 70.1% higher compared to the control. The space-time yield increased to 2.53gl−1 h−1. To our best knowledge, G. oxydans-adhABS showed the highest glycolic acid production ever reported."
16,Discussion,"Molecular properties and mode of action of mADH have been widely investigated (Chinnawirotpisan et al., 2003; Habe et al., 2010a,b; Peters et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2010). However, as a relatively prominent enzyme in acetic acid bacteria, mADH still needs to be further explored and applied. Our recent study has demonstrated that the activity of mADH in the engineered strain G. oxydans-adhABS was 2.1-fold higher than that in the control (Zhang et al., 2016). In the present study, we found that overexpression of mADH could cause a positive metabolic change in G. oxydans DSM 2003, which not only improved the acid-producing capacity, but also up-regulated the respiratory chain, resulting in higher resistance to acid (Fig. 1A). The superior OUR could alleviate adverse effects of inadequate oxygen availability in cultivation processes, leading to better cell growth in a bioreactor (Fig. 1B). Besides mADH, the activities of other membrane-bound dehydrogenases in the engineered strain G. oxydans-adhABS, particularly mALDH, also increased (Fig. 3B). It was speculated that the activities of membrane-bound dehydrogenases in G. oxydans-adhABS might not be high enough to satisfy the increased ability for oxygen reduction due to the up-regulated respiratory chain, and thus need to be improved to balance the respiratory rate. Therefore, G. oxydans DSM 2003 might have an adequate response for overexpression of mADH, which probably on the one hand increased the ability to capture oxygen by enhancing respiratory chain components and on the other hand modulated the electron flux into the respiratory chain by increasing the dehydrogenases activities. It is certainly possible that some other mechanism is at work in the transcriptional regulation. For example, mALDH could be induced by acetaldehyde, an oxidation product of mADH in Acetobacter pasteurianus SKU1108 (Chinnawirotpisan et al., 2003). Therefore, the increased mALDH activity in G. oxydans-adhABS might be related to the overproduction of mADH. Relying on the increased activity of mADH, as well as the advantages of the above, 113.8gl−1 glycolic acid was accumulated by the engineered strain G. oxydans-adhABS in fed-batch fermentation, with a molar yield of 92.9% and a space-time yield of 2.53gl−1 h−1. However, the product inhibition is still a key limitation for the industrial application. Therefore, the ISPR technique will be introduced to further increase glycolic acid production."
