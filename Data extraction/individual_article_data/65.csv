0,Introduction,"Unsaturated CN bonds can act as active electrophilic sites in various chemical reactions, including addition, reduction, cyclization, aziridination, and polymerization [1–3]. Therefore, imines as valuable CN-containing compounds have become essential organic intermediates in biological, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and fine chemical fields [4–9]. Traditionally, imines are synthesized from condensation between carbonyl compounds and amines (Scheme 1 a) [10–13]. However, unsaturated ketones and aldehydes are expensive and unstable, and the reactants are not easily accessible, which severely hinders the industrial applications of this approach. In the past few decades, researchers have made unremitting endeavors to pursue atom-economical and environmentally benign synthetic processes to acquire imine products with high selectivities and yields [14–19]. Of such attempts, the oxidative coupling of amines and alcohols holds great promise for accessibility of imines with water as the only byproduct (Scheme 1b) [20–27]. Furthermore, it would be of significant interest if amines could be substituted with more primitive, cheaper, and more readily available nitro compounds for imine synthesis. In this regard, alcohols can serve as hydrogen donors to efficiently reduce nitroarenes into amines and can also be deprotonated to aldehydes to couple with amines (Scheme 1d). Thus, a one-pot catalytic hydrogen transfer (CHT) cascade reaction between alcohols and nitroarenes has emerged as a powerful method for imine production because it meets atom economy and green synthesis requirements. However, achieving this reaction with high conversions and selectivities is challenging. Rigorous requirements have been proposed for catalysts toward the CHT cascade reaction, as the catalyst must play roles in both hydrogen deprivation from benzyl alcohol and hydrogen transfer to nitrobenzene. In the last decade, catalysts based on noble metals such as Pd [28,29], Ru [30], and Au [31–33] have been proven to be active in the CHT cascade process. For example, Sankar et al. [31] found that Au-Pd/TiO2 was capable of catalytically transferring protons from benzyl alcohol to nitrobenzene under an inert atmosphere and achieved an 88 % imine yield after performing the reaction at 160 °C for 3 h with a nitrobenzene/benzyl alcohol molar ratio of 1/10. Despite the effective catalytic performance of this reaction, however, some existing issues, such as the excess required alcohol [31,33] and high costs, have created demand for further exploration. On the other hand, little research on non-noble-metal catalysis has been reported for the coupling between alcohols and nitroarenes due to their low reactivity. Very recently, Liu’s group developed a non-noble-metal catalyst based on cobalt nanoparticles (Co-N-C/CNT@AC), obtaining a high imine yield at 160 °C for 18 h [34]. Nevertheless, the prolonged reaction time, complicated catalyst preparation, and low turnover frequency (TOF, 0.6 h−1, based on nitrobenzene conversion and Co amount, wt%, Table S1b) need to be further improved for this catalytic system to be applied industrially. Therefore, it is desirable to develop an efficient and economical non-noble-metal catalyst for the CHT cascade reaction. According to the CHT cascade reaction, a suitable catalyst should have both acidic and basic sites to serve as active sites for benzyl alcohol adsorption and hydroxyl deprotonation, respectively. Simultaneously, the lattice oxygen in the catalyst should maintain a high stability to avoid the consumption of deprived hydrogen. Zinc oxide (ZnO), an amphoteric oxide that generally act as a base in catalytic reactions, can be implemented as a basic catalyst for alcohol dehydrogenation under an air or oxygen atmosphere, to yield the corresponding carbonyl compounds [35–37]. Furthermore, unlike reducible metal oxides such as CeO2 and TiO2, ZnO has an invariable valance state and immobile lattice oxygen, and thus it can stabilize activated hydrogen on its surface and prevent water formation. All these features make ZnO a promising catalyst for the CHT cascade reaction. However, its relatively weak surface acidity restricts hydroxyl adsorption and OH bond activation, necessitating a high reaction temperature (>250 °C) and aerobic atmosphere [36,37]. These disadvantages could potentially be addressed by reducing the ZnO particle size to expose more active sites and enhance its deprotonation activity [38] or by depositing transition-metal single atoms on ZnO to improve the catalytic activity [39–41]. In this context, we believe that a structure with highly dispersed ZnO nanoparticles supporting transition metal single atoms would not only increase the surface acidity to improve benzyl alcohol adsorption and weaken the OH bonds but also maintain the ZnO basic sites for hydroxyl and methylene dehydrogenation. The deprived hydrogens would then be directly transferred to nitroarenes due to the weak mobility of the oxygen species of ZnO. Hence, efficient imine synthesis through the CHT cascade reaction between benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene would be achieved. However, there have been no examples for such a designed nanohybrid for this reaction. Herein, a new three-stage nano-pyramid Co-ZnO/nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) material was prepared by calcining a ZnCo-ZIF precursor under an inert atmosphere. In the middle layer of this nano-pyramid, highly dispersed ZnO nanoparticles are supported mainly on the edges of NC (the first floor). Co single atoms (Co SAs), the spire of the nano-pyramid structure, are deposited on the surface of the ZnO nanoparticles. As expected, the prepared Co-ZnO/NC nano-pyramid shows a high catalytic activity toward the CHT cascade reaction between benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene for imine synthesis. The nitrobenzene conversion and imine selectivity reached 94 % and 97 %, respectively, under an ambient inert atmosphere at 160 °C for 4 h with a theoretical molar ratio of nitrobenzene to benzyl alcohol (1/3). Moreover, the TOF (8.8 h−1) is almost 15 times that reported for other non-noble-metal catalysts under the same reaction conditions (160 °C, N2) [34]. To the best of our knowledge, Co-ZnO/NC can be ranked as the highest-performing non-noble-metal catalyst for this reaction (Table S1). As demonstrated by experiments and DFT calculations, the bottom NC of the nano-pyramid catalyst contributes to a high ZnO dispersion. Furthermore, due to the strong interaction between the Co SAs and hydroxyl oxygen atoms in the alcohol, the Co SAs supported on ZnO reduce the reaction barrier for hydroxyl dehydrogenation, facilitating the first and rate-determining step of the cascade reaction. The nano-pyramid Co-ZnO/NC catalyst can also be recycled several times without any significant loss in CHT capacity after re-calcination under a N2 atmosphere. Furthermore, multiple benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene derivatives could also be transformed into the corresponding imines by Co-ZnO/NC, making it accessible to industrial processes."

Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), nitrobenzene, benzyl alcohol, toluene, methanol, and ethanol were obtained from Guangdong Guanghua Technology Co., Ltd. Dodecane was purchased from Sigma Company. The above reagents were of analytical grade and used directly without any further purification before the experiment. Deionized water used in the experiments was from local sources."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation 2.2.1 Preparation of Zn-ZIF, ZnCo-ZIF, and Co-ZIF In a typical synthesis procedure, a 7.5 mmol mixture of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) and zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) were dispersed in 75 ml methanol, which was quickly poured into a methanol solution containing 15.0 mmol dimethyl imidazole (MeIM). After 5 min ultrasonic mixing, the slurry was maintained at room temperature for 4 h. The obtained products marked as Zn-ZIF (only zinc addition), ZnCo-ZIF (Zn/Co = 1:1), and Co-ZIF (only cobalt addition) were washed several times with methanol by centrifugation and dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. 2.2.2 Preparation of ZnO/NC, Co-ZnO/NC and Co/NC The as-synthesized ZIFs were placed in a tubular furnace and heated from room temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min and kept for 3 h under N2 flow."
4,Catalyst evaluation,"2.3 Catalyst evaluation In a typical catalytic hydrogen transfer cascade reaction between nitrobenzene (B) and benzyl alcohol (A), the catalyst (20 mg) was added to the mixture of 1.0 mmol nitrobenzene and 3.0 mmol benzyl alcohol with 1.0 ml toluene as the solvent in a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless autoclave reactor. The sealed reactor was purged with N2 three times, and subsequently heated to 160 °C and kept for 4 h. After the reaction, the mixture was diluted with ethanol and centrifuged. The conversion of the reactant (nitrobenzene) and the yield of the imine product (N-benzylidene aniline, C) were measured by a gas chromatograph (GC, FULI GC 9720) with SE-54 capillary column (30 m ×0.32 mm ×0.5 μm) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) using dodecane as the internal standard. The operating conditions were as follows: the flow rate of the N2 carrier gas was 30 mL/min; the injection port temperature was 250 °C. The GC oven temperature program was as follows: first holding at 70 °C for 1 min, then increasing from 70 °C to 240 °C with a heating rate of 12 °C/min, finally holding at 240 °C for 0.5 min. The nitrobenzene conversion (ConB ) is defined by: (1) C o n B % = n B - n B ' n B × 100 and the yield of imine (YieC ) is calculated based on nitrobenzene conversion by: (2) Y i e C % = n c ' n B × 100 Hence, the selectivity of imine (SelC ) based on nitrobenzene conversion could be expressed as: (3) S e l C % = Y i e C C o n B × 100 Where: nB : the molar amount of nitrobenzene added in the reaction system, mmol; nB': the molar amount of nitrobenzene in the reaction system after the reaction, mmol; nC': the molar amount of imine in the reaction system after the reaction, mmol. Catalytic activity per catalyst amount (R1, mmolconverted nitrobenzene g−1 h−1) could be expressed as: (4) R 1 = n B * C o n B % m * t Catalytic activity per metal amount (R2, mmolconverted nitrobenzene gmetal −1 h−1) could be expressed as: (5) R 2 = n B * C o n B % Z n w t % + C o w t % * m * t Turnover frequency (TOF, mmolconverted nitrobenzene mmol−1 h−1) could be expressed as: (6) T O F = n B * C o n B % Z n w t % M Z n + C o w t % M C o * m * t Where: nB : the molar amount of nitrobenzene added in the reaction system, mmol; ConB: the nitrobenzene conversion was determined by GC using dodecane as an internal, %; Co wt% and Zn wt%: the cobalt and zinc contents in the catalysts which are determined by ICP-MS; MCo : the molar mass of Co, 58.93 g/mol; MZn : the molar mass of Zn, 65.41 g/mol; m: the mass amount of the catalysts added in the reaction system, g; t: reaction time, h."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of both ZIF and carbon materials were recorded on a Bruker D8 DISCOVER A25 X-ray diffractometer (Germany) with Co Kα radiation (3 kV). The samples' morphology and structure were studied using field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI Verious G4) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200X TEM operated at 200 kV). Co and Zn contents were obtained on Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS, NexION™ 350D PerkinElmer USA). X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were recorded using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD-7000S from Shimadzu) to characterize the structure and crystallinity of the samples. N2-adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distributions were obtained using the 3H-2000PS2 type PS2-0790 Surface Area Porosity Analyzer from Beishide Instrument Technology (Beijing) Co.,Ltd. The samples were degassed at 80 °C for 4 h under vacuum before testing. The specific surface area and pore volume were calculated from the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with an Axis Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy manufactured by Kratos Company in the United Kingdom. The instrument used an Al Kα ray light source to measure the total ambient gas pressure (<10−8 Pa). NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) were carried out on a Micromeritics Autochem II chemisorption analyzer. 50 mg sample loaded in a quartz reactor was pre-treated with Ar at 500 °C. After cooling to 50 °C, NH3 or CO2 adsorption was performed by switching Ar to NH3 or CO2 gas and then maintaining 2 h. After adsorption, the physical adsorption of NH3 or CO2 was removed at the same temperature by Ar purging for 1 h. Then, TPD was detected by Thermal Conductive Detector (TCD) in the Ar flow by raising the temperature to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy of carbon monoxide adsorption (CO-DRIFTS) was recorded on a Bruker Optics VERTEX 70 equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector and a PIKE Diffuse IR chamber, using an in situ IR cell equipped with ZnSe windows, which was connected to a conventional gas flow system. The recorded spectra consisted of 32 scans at 4 cm-1 resolution. Before CO adsorption, the catalysts powders (∼20 mg) were put into the DRIFTS cell under a 10 v% H2/Ar flow (30 mL/min) and pretreated at 350 °C for 2 h, followed by Ar purge (30 mL/min) for another 1 h, and then cooled down to 30 °C to collect background. Thereafter, the sample was exposed under 5 v% CO/Ar (30 mL/min) for 15 min."
6,DFT calculations,"2.5 DFT calculations The structure optimizations were performed by spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) using Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). The generalized gradient approximation of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) was employed to describe the electronic exchange-correlation effects. The projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudo potential was applied to take the ion-electron interactions into account. The valence density was expanded in a plane-wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV. The Grimme’s semiempirical DFT-D3 approach was chosen for the van der Waals interaction between reaction intermediates and substrate. The climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method was adopted to search for the saddle point and the optimal reaction pathway. The vacuum distance of 15 Å along the z direction was used to minimize interaction between periodically repeated slabs. The structures were relaxed with the energy converged of 10−5 eV, and the force converged of 0.02 eV Å-1 for each atom, respectively."
7,Structural model,"2.6 Structural model The optimized lattice constants of bulk ZnO are a =3.247 Å and c =5.253 Å using 14 × 14 × 8 Monkhorst pack k-points mesh, which is in good agreement with the experimentally measured values (a =3.249 Å and c =5.210 Å). A four-unit-layer slab with a 3 × 2 supercell was modeled the ZnO (100) surface, which contains 48 Zn atoms and 48 O atoms. The bottom two layers of the ZnO (100) slab were fixed at their crystal lattice positions while the adsorbate and the top layers of the ZnO (100) slab were allowed to relax fully. A 5 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst pack k-points mesh was applied to sample the Brillouin zone of the supercells."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Catalyst synthesis and characterizations,"3.1 Catalyst synthesis and characterizations As shown in Fig. 1 , the nano-pyramid Co-ZnO/NC catalyst was fabricated via a two-step process: (1) synthesis of ZnCo-ZIF with an appropriate Zn/Co ratio and (2) controlled pyrolysis of the ZnCo-ZIF precursor at 900 °C in a N2 atmosphere to prepare the nano-pyramid Co-ZnO/NC hybrid. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. S1) patterns and N2 sorption isotherms (Fig. S2 and Table S2) confirmed that the ZnCo-ZIF precursor possessed a ZIF-8 structure with micropores. Scanning electron microscopy (a1, Fig. 2 ) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, a2, Fig. 2) revealed that ZnCo-ZIF had a well-defined rhombic dodecahedral shape with smooth surfaces and a uniform size distribution, and after pyrolysis, the obtained Co-ZnO/NC preserved the rhombic dodecahedral morphology (Fig. 2b) High-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and STEM energy dispersive X-ray (STEM-EDX) elemental analysis (Fig. 2c) of Co-ZnO/NC showed no notable large inorganic particles, and the observed Zn and Co were highly dispersed. This was further confirmed by the XRD pattern of Co-ZnO/NC (Fig. 2f), which lacked any characteristic signals of Zn, Co, or ZnO. In contrast, the further aberration-corrected TEM images (Fig. 2d) exhibited multiple small particles (2−5 nm) located mainly on the edges of the NC with clear lattice fringes. The interplanar distances measured as 0.281, 0.260, and 0.247 nm correspond to the (100), (002), and (101) planes of ZnO, respectively, demonstrating that the small particles are single-crystal ZnO. The existence of ZnO was also proven by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. 2g), where the prominent peaks in the Zn 2p spectrum of Co-ZnO/NC appeared at approximately 1021.4 eV (Zn 2p3/2) and 1044.4 eV (Zn 2p1/2), suggesting an electronic state of Zn2+ [42]. Moreover, as shown in the HAADF-STEM and STEM-EDX images (Fig. 2e), several relatively bright spots were recognized as Co SAs distributed on the surface of the ZnO nanocrystals. The Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 2h) also revealed no distinct peaks belonging to Co0 species on Co-ZnO/NC, further confirming the existence of Co SAs on the surface of ZnO. Moreover, the existing of Co SAs was also validated through CO DRIFTS spectra of the Co-ZnO/NC (Fig. S3) by the broad peaks at 2235 and 2138 cm−1 attributing to linear adsorption of CO on oxidized cobalt species (Co2+ and Co3+) [43–45]. Accordingly, we constructed a hierarchical nano-pyramid-like hybrid composed of Co SAs supported by highly dispersed ZnO nanoparticles loaded on the edge of NC. The BET surface areas (Fig. S2 and Table S3) of the ZnCo/NC materials displayed a decreasing trend along with the increase of Co content in the following order: ZnO/NC (904 m2/g) > Co-ZnO/NC (820 m2/g) > Co/NC (246 m2/g), which may be derived from the highly dispersion of ZnO species in both ZnO/NC and Co-ZnO/NC catalysts and the agglomeration of cobalt species in the Co/NC catalyst."
10,Catalytic performance toward CHT cascade reaction,"3.2 Catalytic performance toward CHT cascade reaction The CHT cascade reaction for imine synthesis was performed at 160 °C for 4 h under a N2 atmosphere with a nitrobenzene to benzyl alcohol molar ratio of 1/3. As expected, the nitrobenzene conversion and imine yield reached 94 % and 91 %, respectively, over Co-ZnO/NC. No aniline was detected in any of the obtained reaction mixtures, and the secondary amine yield was 3%, indicating excellent selectivity toward the target imine. A straightforward comparison of Co-ZnO/NC with reported catalysts (Table S1) confirmed that the new nano-pyramid is a state-of-the-art non-noble-metal catalyst for the CHT cascade reaction, with a catalytic capacity rivaling even that of several reported noble-metal catalysts. The excellent catalytic performance of Co-ZnO/NC verified our initial idea that highly dispersed ZnO nanoparticles supporting transition-metal SAs would benefit the CHT cascade reaction for imine synthesis from benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene. In addition, TOF (Eq. (6)) was calculated based on the total metal contents. The TOF achieved by Co-ZnO/NC (calculated as 8.8 h−1) is one order of magnitude higher than that of the reported Co-N-C/CNT@AC catalyst (0.6 h-1, Table S1b) [34] under the same reaction conditions. ZnO/NC and Co/NC, obtained through the pyrolysis of Zn-ZIF and Co-ZIF precursors, respectively, were also used to catalyze the CHT reaction. As suggested by TEM and HR-TEM (Figs. S4 and S5), ZnO/NC, like Co-ZnO/NC, contained ZnO nanoparticles on the edges of the NC, whereas metallic Co nanoparticles were identified on Co/NC. XRD (Fig. 2f) and XPS (Fig. 2g and h) further verified the presence of ZnO and metallic cobalt on ZnO/NC and Co/NC, respectively. Both catalysts were active toward the CHT cascade reaction between alcohol and nitrobenzene (Tables 1 and S4), indicating that ZnO and metallic cobalt species could also serve as active sites for the reaction. However, their catalytic performances were inferior to that of Co-ZnO/NC."
11,Catalytic sites and rate-determining step verification,"3.3 Catalytic sites and rate-determining step verification To determine the main catalytic sites in the nano-pyramid Co-ZnO/NC, a series of Zn, Co, and carbon-based samples were chosen to catalyze the CHT cascade reaction for imine synthesis (Table S5). The pristine ZIF material showed no catalytic performance toward this reaction. Activated carbon (AC) and NC exhibited deficient catalytic activities, indicating that the NC in Co-ZnO/NC mainly functions as a catalyst support for the dispersion of ZnO nanoparticles. The other characterizations further verifying the effect of NC species are illustrated in Supplementary Material (Fig. S6). Moreover, compared with Co-ZnO/NC and ZnO/NC, bulk ZnO particles, CoO, and Co particles also showed low nitrobenzene conversions, whereas ZnO supported by AC exhibited slightly improved catalytic performance, proving that a high dispersion of active components is essential for a high catalytic performance. Subsequently, acid-etching experiments that could destroy the surface ZnO or Co-ZnO particles were performed to further ascertain the catalytic active sites of Co-ZnO/NC. Co-ZnO/NC was immersed in a 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution for several hours (denoted as Co-ZnO/NC-H-t). As shown in Fig. 3 a, H2SO4 etching of the catalyst greatly hindered its CHT performance, as Co-ZnO/NC lost 40 % of its hydrogen transfer ability with only 30 min of etching. As the etching time increased, the nitrobenzene conversion and imine yield declined gradually, and after etching for 24 h, Co-ZnO/NC-H-24 showed only a 22 % nitrobenzene conversion. Further elevating etching temperature could not completely deactivate the catalyst, as it maintained a nitrobenzene conversion into imine of approximately 20 % (Table S6). Moreover, the nitrobenzene conversions of ZnO/NC-H-24 and Co/NC-H-24 were reduced to 21 % and 4 %, respectively (Table 1). The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry results (Table 1) of the etched catalysts revealed that residual metals remained even after etching for 24 h. The HAADF-STEM images (Fig. S7) confirmed that these metallic species were in the form of Zn/Co SAs on NC or carbon-encapsulated metal/metal oxide nanoparticles. The Zn/Co SAs on the NC might account for the remaining catalytic activity of Co-ZnO/NC-H-24 due to the carbon-encapsulated metal/metal oxide could not connect with reactants during the reaction process. The metal losses were 4.7 wt% (Zn content) for ZnO/NC-H-24 and 3.7 wt% (Zn and Co contents) for Co-ZnO/NC-H-24, whereas their corresponding catalytic activities declined by 20 % and 72 %, respectively. These results further support that the Co SAs deposited on highly dispersed ZnO nanoparticles were the main catalytic active sites and accounted for approximately 72 % of the 94 % nitrobenzene conversion of the nano-pyramid Co-ZnO/NC catalyst, which is almost 3.5 times that of the highly dispersed ZnO (20 %) in ZnO/NC. Several comparative experiments were carried out to explore the functions of the Co-ZnO active sites and elucidate the reaction mechanism of the CHT cascade process over Co-ZnO/NC. Initially, the amount of the nitrobenzene reactant was altered. As shown in Fig. 3b, when the nitrobenzene amount was increased from 1 to 2 mmol, the benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene conversion rates and imine production amounts exhibited negligible vibrations. This indicated that the nitrobenzene molecule does not participate in the rate-determining elementary reaction step and that nitrobenzene hydrogenation could occur swiftly once the protons were removed from benzyl alcohol by the catalyst. Hence, it could be preliminarily deduced that benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation into benzaldehyde is the rate-determining step. To verify this inference, benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation under an inert atmosphere with no hydrogen acceptor was carried out. All three catalysts demonstrated low dehydrogenation performances (benzyl alcohol conversions <10 %), compared with the benzyl alcohol conversions (>40 %) obtained during the CHT cascade process. This is because the hydrogen deprived from benzyl alcohol occupied the active sites of the catalysts when no hydrogen acceptor (such as nitrobenzene) was present in the reaction system, and thus the continuous dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohols was inhibited. On the other hand, the TOF trend for benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation (Fig. 3c, Co-ZnO/NC > ZnO/NC > Co/NC) was almost the same as that of the CHT cascade reaction, further confirming that benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation into benzaldehyde is the rate-determining step. Moreover, the coupling between aniline and benzaldehyde proceeded rapidly even without the catalyst, and the three catalysts exhibited indistinct behaviors toward the reaction (Fig. 3d). Experimental time tracking of the reaction demonstrated trace amounts of aniline (4 %) in the early period, whereas no aniline was present after reacting for 2 h (Fig. S8), further confirming that the coupling between aniline and benzaldehyde was rapid. These results confirm that benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation is the rate-determining step in this CHT cascade reaction."
12,DFT calculations,"3.4 DFT calculations DFT calculations were performed to interpret the role of the decorated Co SA on the ZnO surface in improving the catalytic activity for benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation. Based on TEM observations and the stability of the hexagonal zincite faces, the ZnO (100) facet was selected for the simulation (a1, Fig. 4 ). A single Co atom preferred to be between two O atoms of the ZnO (100) facet with a Co–O bond length of 1.77 Å after optimizing various structures (a2, Fig. 4). To evaluate the structural stability, the binding energy (ΔE binding,Co) was first calculated by ΔE binding,Co = E Co/ZnO – E ZnO - E Co, where E Co/ZnO, E ZnO, and E Co are the total energies of the ZnO (100) facet with and without the decorated Co atom and an isolated Co atom, respectively. The results demonstrated that a single Co atom can stably anchor on the ZnO (100) facet with a calculated binding energy of –2.42 eV. Moreover, there is a significant charge transfer (0.59|e|) from the decorated Co atom to the ZnO (100) facet based on Bader charge analysis. It was also found that a strong interaction occurs between the decorated Co atom and ZnO (100) facet, which is crucial for the subsequent dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol. According to the previous discussion, benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation is the rate-determining step in the CHT cascade reaction. Thus, to save computing resources, only the dehydrogenation reactions of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde on the pure ZnO (100) and Co/ZnO (100) facets were investigated. On the pure ZnO (100) facet, benzyl alcohol can adsorb on the Zn atom via the hydroxyl oxygen atom with a Zn–O distance of 2.13 Å (S1, Fig. 4b). Moreover, the OH bond length (0.98 Å) of the hydroxyl group in the adsorbed benzyl alcohol is slightly longer than that (0.97 Å) of the isolated benzyl alcohol molecule, suggesting that the OH bonding has been activated. The activated hydroxyl H atom shifts to the adjacent O atom of the ZnO (100) facet during the first dehydrogenation reaction, which must overcome a high activation barrier of 2.38 eV (Fig. 4b). In the first dehydrogenation reaction, the hydroxyl OH distance elongates to 1.80 Å in the transition state (TS1, Fig. 4b) from the initial distance of 0.98 Å in the reactant (S1, Fig. 4b) and reaches 2.70 Å in the product (S2, Fig. 4b), which demonstrates that the hydroxyl H atom completely shifts to the ZnO (100) facet. In the second dehydrogenation reaction, another methylene H atom shifts to the adjacent Zn atom, which only needs to overcome a much lower activation barrier of 0.50 eV (Fig. 4c). In this dehydrogenation process, the methylene CH distance changes to 1.86 Å in the transition state (TS2, Fig. 4c) from the initial 1.18 Å in the reactant (S2, Fig. 4c), and then researches 2.40 Å in the product (S3, Fig. 4c), which demonstrates that the methylene H atom has also completely shifts to the ZnO (100) facet. In this two-step dehydrogenation reaction, the first is the rate-limiting step due to its higher activation barrier. Therefore, it is crucial to diminish the activation barrier of the first step to improve the catalytic activity toward benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation. The activation barrier of the first dehydrogenation reaction on the Co/ZnO (100) facet was further calculated to interpret the experimental observations. As expected, the activation barrier decreased to 1.85 eV (Fig. 4d) after a single Co atom was anchored on the ZnO (100) facet. These data are in good agreement with the experimental observations and suggest that the Co atom can facilitate hydroxyl dehydrogenation and improve the catalytic activity. In contrast to the process on the pure ZnO (100) facet, benzyl alcohol can adsorb on the Co atom via the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group with a Co–O distance of 1.91 Å (S4, Fig. 4d). However, the optimized hydroxyl OH bonding length (0.98 Å) in the adsorbed benzyl alcohol and the change of OH bonding length in the first dehydrogenation reaction (0.98 Å in reactant S4, Fig. 4d; 1.76 Å in transition state TS3, Fig. 4d; and 2.71 Å in product of S5, Fig. 4d) are identical to those on the pure ZnO (100) facet. Most importantly, the relative energy of product S5 is 0.73 eV below that of reactant S4 after the first dehydrogenation, indicating a more vital interaction between the product and anchored Co atom after removing the H atom from the hydroxyl group. This strong interaction arising from the adsorbed Co atom is an intrinsic factor in decreasing the activation energy of the first dehydrogenation reaction and enhancing the catalytic activity toward benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation."
13,Catalytic mechanism,"3.5 Catalytic mechanism Combining the experimental results and DFT calculations, the proposed reaction mechanism over Co-ZnO/NC is illustrated in Scheme 2 . Owing to the electronic structure and bonding with two lattice oxygen atoms of ZnO, Co has a stronger acidity than Zn2+ in Co-ZnO (active site A, Scheme 2). NH3 temperature-programmed-desorption (Fig. S9) also confirmed this conclusion. Accordingly, the O atom of benzyl alcohol hydroxyl group can be preferentially drawn to the Co atom at active site A (step 1, Scheme 2). Subsequently, H+ from the hydroxyl group transfers to the adjacent O atom due to the strong interaction between the Co atom and hydroxyl O atom. Finally, α-H from the benzyloxy methylene group is deprived to Zn2+ in the form of H−, forming intermediate B and simultaneously producing benzaldehyde. For the CHT reaction (step 2, Scheme 2), it has been reported that the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline follows three main steps [46–50]. First, PhNO2 obtains two electrons and two H atoms to form PhNO (nitrosobenzene), PhNO is hydrogenated into PhNHOH (phenylhydroxylamine) by two electrons and two H atoms, and finally PhNH2 (aniline) forms via PhNHOH reduction through a similar process. During the CHT route in our catalytic system, the electron-deficient N atom in nitrobenzene attracts a pair of electrons from the H δ − of intermediate B and further removes the H δ + from B. Then, PhNO2 is hydrogenated into the PhNO intermediate. Meanwhile, active site A is exposed for the next circulation of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation. The PhNO intermediate further reacts with another pair of H δ − and H δ + from the newly formed intermediate B, which is reduced to PhNHOH. Finally, PhNHOH is converted to PhNH2 through a similar hydrogenation process. Once aniline forms, it immediately reacts with benzaldehyde to yield the target imine (step 3, Scheme 2) [22]. The CHT reaction mechanism between benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene over Co/NC catalyst is also proposed, the details are shown in Scheme S1."
14,Catalyst recyclability and universality,"3.6 Catalyst recyclability and universality Recycling tests were implemented to examine the reusability and stability of the Co-ZnO/NC nanohybrid (Fig. S10). After three cycles, the nitrobenzene conversion and imine selectivity decreased from 94 % and 97 % to 74 % and 91 %, respectively. However, the TEM images (Fig. S11) of the recycled nano-pyramid catalyst after three cycles displayed no structural agglomeration or destruction, which suggests that the loss of the reactivity of Co-ZnO/NC mainly stems from the coverage of active sites by the adsorption of organic reactants and products. In addition, the reactivity can easily be recovered by high-temperature pyrolysis [51]. Indeed, the recycled catalyst regained its catalytic hydrogen transfer activity after re-calcinating under N2 at 900 °C for 3 h. Other aromatic alcohols and substituted nitrobenzene derivatives were selected as reactants to determine the scope of the CHT cascade reaction over the nano-pyramid Co-ZnO/NC catalyst. Interestingly, Co-ZnO/NC exhibited a much higher catalytic capacity than other reported non-noble-metal catalysts for imine derivatives [34]. As listed in Table 2 , the hydrogen atoms from aromatic alcohols with different substituents and heteroaromatic alcohols could all be transferred to nitrobenzene, yielding the corresponding imines smoothly (entries 2f–8f). Moreover, the reaction activities of alcohols with electron-donating groups were higher than those with electron-withdrawing groups, which might be caused by the relatively higher electron densities of the alcoholic hydroxyl groups. Similarly, nitrobenzenes substituted with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups (entries 9f–12f) could be steadily transfer-hydrogenated into the corresponding imines by benzyl alcohol over Co-ZnO/NC, achieving moderate to high yields. Since the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene is not the rate-determining step, nitrobenzenes with both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups at the para position could be steadily hydrogenated to form the related imines at almost the same reaction rates. Conversely, nitrobenzenes with substituent groups at the ortho position exhibited lower conversions, likely due to steric effects."
15,Conclusion,"A novel hierarchical nano-pyramid-like hybrid Co-ZnO/NC, where Co SAs were deposited on highly dispersed ZnO nanoparticles supported by an NC material, was prepared by calcining a bimetallic ZnCo-ZIF precursor with an appropriate Zn/Co ratio under an inert atmosphere. The hybrid showed an excellent catalytic performance toward the CHT cascade reaction between nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol under an ambient inert atmosphere at 160 °C for 4 h with a nitrobenzene/benzyl alcohol molar ratio of 1/3. The nitrobenzene conversion and imine selectivity reached 94 % and 97 %, respectively, and the TOF (8.8 h−1) was almost 15 times that reported for Co-N-C/CNT@AC. To the best of our knowledge, Co-ZnO/NC can be considered a state-of-the-art non-noble-metal catalyst for this reaction. The excellent catalytic activity of nano-pyramid Co-ZnO/NC is derived from the Co SAs supported on ZnO, which reduce the reaction barrier for hydroxyl dehydrogenation of the alcohol, facilitating the first and rate-determining step of the cascade reaction. Moreover, Co-ZnO/NC can be recycled several times without significant loss in CHT capacity after re-calcination under a N2 atmosphere, and the catalyst exhibits good universality toward multiple benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene derivatives, showing every aspect in industrial applications."
