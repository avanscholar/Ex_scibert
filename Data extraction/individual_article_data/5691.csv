0,Introduction,"As the greenhouse effect increasingly attracting worldwide attention, the legislation on the internal combustion engine (ICE) industry forces the manufacturers to develop clean and high-efficiency ICEs urgently. One of the low cost and effective method to achieve this goal is adopting clean and renewable alternative fuels for ICEs. Compared with traditional gasoline fuels, hydrogen blended natural gas offers considerable environmental and economic advantages. Hydrogen addition on natural gas could improve the engine thermal efficiency [1,2], working performance [3,4] and reduce the cycle-to-cycle variations [5] and emission pollutant [6,7], since highly reactive hydrogen could overcome the main drawbacks of natural gas as engine fuel, resulting from the poor ignitability of and low flame speed of methane (the main component of natural gas) [8,9]. Meanwhile, hydrogen and natural gas could be premixed in advance and store together in the gas tank, which avoids the cost of dual fuel supply systems. Except for utilities in the transportation industry, hydrogen blended natural gas could also be used for domestic appliances. In Netherland, hydrogen blended natural gas is seen as a transition plan from the current fossil-fuel-based economy to a future sustainable hydrogen economy [10], considering the mixtures could be stored in the established natural gas infrastructure. The physicochemical properties of binary fuels are distinct from solo fuel, for the purpose of developing high-performance hydrogen blended natural gas engine, researchers have conducted many studies to understand the combustion process of hydrogen blended natural gas or methane. Due to the relatively simple and well established kinetic mechanism and molecular structures of CH4 and H2, their mixtures are also often adopted in fundamental combustion studies in regards to the properties of the binary fuels. For instance, accurate laminar burning velocity measurement on various hydrogen fractions [11] and pressures [12], flame instabilities under different dilution gases [13] and initial conditions [14], premixed [15] and non-premixed [16] turbulent flame behaviors, explosion characteristics under laminar [17] and turbulent conditions [18], near-wall ignited flame propagation [19] and so on. Hydrogen addition could extend the methane flammabilities limit [20,21], decrease the flame quenching distance [22] and significantly increase the flame extinction strain rate [23], all of these properties are advantageous to increase the thermal efficiency of devices, A comprehensive and thorough review summarizes the studies of hydrogen addition effects on fundamental combustion properties [24]. Obviously, for blended fuels, the relative content of each fuel will influence the global combustion characteristics of mixtures. Zhang et al. [25] conducted shock tube experiments to measure the ignition delay time (IDT) of CH4/H2/O2/Ar mixtures and found that hydrogen addition on methane could reduce the IDT of mixtures because the increased concentration of free radicals such as H, O and OH promotes the oxidation of methane. When hydrogen mole fraction is less than 40% the fuel mixtures present typical hydrocarbon ignition behavior. In this case, the methane chemistry dominates the ignition. When the hydrogen fraction is more than 80%, the typical hydrogen ignition behavior is presented, and the hydrogen chemistry dominates the ignition of the mixtures. Similar behaviors also present in the changes of laminar burning velocity (LBV) with hydrogen fraction. Through one-dimensional planar flame simulation with GRI-mech 3.0, Di Sarlia et al. [26] reported that there are methane-dominated combustion regime, transition regime and methane-inhibited hydrogen combustion regime in the methane/hydrogen/air blending flame propagation, corresponding to 0–50%, 50%–90%, 90%–100% hydrogen fractions. In the transition regime, the LBV increases exponentially, while in the other two regimes, the LBV increases nearly linearly but with different slopes. The overall nonlinear increase of LBV was verified by the comprehensive experimental measurement of Hu et al. [12], though the regime partition is slightly different. Tang et al. [27] performed the variation of effective Lewis number, global activation energy, and adiabatic flame temperature of mixtures after adding hydrogen into hydrocarbon flames and concluded that the increased trend of LBV results from facilitated diffusion, intensified reactivity, and increased flame temperature. Moreover, by defining a special hydrogen addition parameter and effective fuel equivalence ratio, the LBV could linearly vary with these parameters. Furthermore, the flame instabilities of CH4/H2/air flame changes nonmonotonically with hydrogen mole fraction in the fuels, which could be quantified by Markstein length of the spherically expanding flame. It was proved that the simultaneous changes of mixtures Lewis number and Zel’dovich number caused by hydrogen addition makes their coupled term in Markstein length changes nonmonotonically, which is responsible for the first decreased then increased behavior [28,29]. DNS results of 1D unsteady spherical flame from Chen [30] accurately captured that the most unstable CH4/H2/air flame is presented around hydrogen mole fraction near 80%. The interesting nonlinear and nonmonotonic behaviors of CH4/H2/air flame attract researchers’ attention, and many studies try to explain these phenomena from the changes in mixtures properties. Cheng et al. [31] numerically investigated the hydrogen addition effects on several light hydrocarbons and proposed that the hydrogen addition will change overall activation energy controlled by chemical kinetics, flame temperature controlled by thermodynamics and mixture Lewis number controlled by species transport. All three factors alter flame parameters, such as LBV, flame thickness, Markstein number and so on. In this study, we try to further understand the CH4/H2/air premixed flame through chemical kinetics, thermodynamics and species transport aspects through the more fundamental unit, i.e. from the individual elementary reactions related to the chemical pathway and individual species physical parameters. The objective of this study is trying to explore: (1) whether there are distinctive reaction pathway in CH4/H2/air making some unimportant elementary reactions in pure fuel combustion become essential in blend combustion; (2) whether there are some negligible species in both pure CH4 and H2 combustion imposing large influence on their blends combustion due to the changes in thermodynamics and transport properties of species, and need to be paid special attention to them. To achieve this objective, the recently developed global pathway analysis [32] and classical sensitivity analysis for thermal properties and transport properties of each species are adopted under the normal and elevated pressures and various hydrogen addition fractions. The results of these questions could be in favor of better understanding and modeling of CH4/H2/air premixed combustion."
1,Methodology,"The previous study showed that compared with other popular light hydrocarbon mechanisms, AramcoMech 1.3 [33] developed by NUI Galway gives the best agreement with the experimental data of laminar burning velocity in different hydrogen content, equivalence ratio and initial temperature [34]. Moreover, the ignition delay times of CH4/H2 mixtures in shock tube experiments agree best with the NUI Galway mechanism [35], which is the predecessor of AramcoMech 1.3. Therefore, in this study, the analysis of CH4/H2/air combustion process will be based on the AramcoMech 1.3. Currently adopted C3 version mechanism includes a total of 124 species and 766 reactions. The simulation of 1-D unstretched CH4/H2/air laminar flames was performed using the open-source package CANTERA [36], at the initial temperature of 298 K, the initial pressure of 1 bar, 10 bar, 20 bar and equivalence ratio ( ϕ ) of 1.0. Transport properties of each species and mixtures are derived by multi-component transport model; thermal diffusion is taken into consideration. The final gird refinement criterion for gradient and curvature of scalar filed are set to 0.02 and 0.04 to ensure a grid-independent solution. More than 700 girds were generated for each case. The combustion process of CH4/H2/air mixtures is presented under hydrogen fraction from 0% to 99%. Since pure H2/air mixture does not include the hydrocarbon oxidation reaction pathway, to make a comparison with other CH4/H2 blends. 99% H2 and 1% CH4 mixtures ( α = 99 % ) is used to approach H2 oxidation. The hydrogen addition mole fraction α is defined as the mole fraction of hydrogen in total fuel: (1) α = X H 2 X H 2 + X C H 4 × 100 % where X i is the mole fraction of each species."
2,Global pathway analysis,"2.1 Global pathway analysis Global Pathway Selection algorithm (GPS) was recently developed by Gao et al. [37]. It could find the several most important global pathway in the combustion process according to the atomic flux analysis. The idea behind this method is similar to the traditional Path flux algorithm (PFA) [38]. Nevertheless, rather than only one or two reaction generation considered in PFA, GPS could find all the generation from the initial reactants and final products. By removing the unimportant species whose portion of the atomic flux passed through is below a preset threshold, GPS could be a very effective automatic tool for obtaining skeleton mechanism from complex, detail mechanism. By using the same idea, Global Pathways analysis (GPA) provides a simplified representation of the reacting system, yet reflecting the key chemical information of species conversion, which can be applied as an analysis tool. Compared with traditional reaction pathway analysis included in CHEMKIN and CANTERA, which could only perform the reaction pathway at a specific position or timing, GPA could show the contribution of each reaction pathway from the initial reactant to the final product over the entire reaction zone or entire reaction process (for transient 0D ignition) in a intuitive way. Meanwhile, GPA also relates the reaction pathway to radical production and elementary reactions. This feature allows us to better understand the reacting system involves complex chemical kinetics. GPA has been successfully applied to interpret the classic second explosion limit of hydrogen, the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) regime of n-heptane ignition [32] and the extinction and re-ignition of a turbulent non-premixed flame [39] by the competition of different Global Pathway. In GPA, several parameters are introduced to provide the information on the competition between each global pathway and influence on the combustion process. D GP is the fraction of a certain element atom (for instance, H or C) passing through one of the global reaction pathways, which ranges from 0 to 1: (2) D GP = D source D GP / s o u r c e where D source is the ratio of the number of certain kind of atom from the source species of one global pathway to the total number of this atom, defined as: (3) D s o u r c e = n source , i n t N source ∑ i n i , i n t N i The subscript ‘source’ means the first species in a given global pathway. N i is the certain atom number in one i-th species molecule. n i , i n t denotes the number of moles of i-th species in the initial reactants. The fraction of certain atom that passes from the source species to final species through this given global pathway is represented by D GP / s o u r c e , which is the geometric mean of a certain kind of atom distributed to the conversion steps of this global pathway: (4) D GP / s o u r c e = ∏ i , j ∈ G P A i → j ∑ k A i → j 1 G P where G P is the number of conversion steps of this global pathway. The element flux from i-th species to j-th species is denoted by A i → j : (5) A i → j = ∑ r max 0 , C , r , i → j ω ̇ r where ω ̇ r represents the local net reaction rate of the r-th reaction. C , r , i → j is the number of the certain kind of atoms transferred from the i-th species to j-th species by the r-th reaction, calculated as: (6) C , r , i → j = ν r , j N j ν r , j N i ∑ k : ν r , k < 0 ν r , k N k , ν r , j , ν r , i < 0 0 , otherwise , where ν r , i is the stoichiometric coefficient of the i-th species in the r-th reaction, which is positive for products and negative for reactants. The R GP quantifies the sum of net radical production rates of all reactions in a global pathway normalized by its D GP: (7) R G P = D GP ∑ r ∈ G P Ω r Ω r denotes the net radical production rate of r-th reaction: (8) Ω r = ω ̇ r ∑ r δ k ν r , k δ k is 1 for active radical (O, H and OH), otherwise it is 0."
3,Sensitivity analysis,"2.2 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis is a classic methodology for understanding the scientific and industrial systems through quantified the impact of inputs on outputs [40]. The sensitivity coefficients could be obtained by perturbing a certain input parameter and observing the changes of system outcomes. The relative (normalized) sensitivity coefficient S i could be calculated by [41]: (9) S i rel = ln S l ln A = A S l ∂ S l ∂ A ≈ A S l Δ S l Δ A where S l is the system outcome quantity of interest, in the present study, is the laminar burning velocity of CH4/H2/air mixtures. A denoted the input parameters, in this study is the transport and thermal properties of each species, including Lennard-Jones collision diameter (L.J diameter), enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity. Detail pattern follows the method proposed by Long et al. [42]. The first order brute force finite difference sensitivity is obtained by manipulating the parameters in the thermal and transport data files. The NASA 7-coefficient polynomial parameterization is used to compute the thermodynamic properties of individual species according to [43]: (10) C p R = a 1 + a 2 T + a 3 T 2 + a 4 T 3 + a 5 T 4 (11) H 0 T RT = a 1 + a 2 2 T + a 3 3 T 2 + a 4 4 T 3 + a 5 5 T 4 + a 6 1 T (12) S R = a 1 ln T + a 2 T + a 3 2 T 2 + a 4 3 T 3 + a 5 4 T 4 + a 7 Since the coefficient a6 and a7 are only involved in the fitting of enthalpy and entropy, respectively. To independently perturb each thermodynamic parameter, 5 kJ/mol is added to enthalpies by increasing 601.39 to NASA parameter a6 and 10 J/mol K is added to entropies by increasing 1.2027 to NASA parameter a7. For heat capacity, a perturbation equal to half that of entropy is used by adding 0.60139 to parameter a1. Meanwhile, since heat capacity perturbation will also influence enthalpy and entropy according to the integral relation: (13) H 0 T RT = b 1 T + ∫ C p 0 T d T RT (14) S 0 T RT = b 2 + ∫ C p 0 T d T RT To avoid the reference enthalpy and entropy changed by heat capacity shifts, 0.60139/298 is subtracted from a6 and 0.60139·ln (298) is subtracted from a7 at the same time. Above mentioned procedures are automatically conducted by a python code. The Lennard-Jones collision diameter is increased by 1.2 times. This will cause a roughly 15% reduction in the diffusion velocity for all species. Moreover, for the dominant species, the viscosity and thermal conductivity of mixture are also slightly reduced. Detail discussion on the change of these parameters caused by Lennard-Jones collision diameter could be found in reference [42]. Thermodynamic parameters are perturbed by adding a constant number since enthalpy and entropy are relative parameters, relative changes are not meaningful. In these cases, the calculation of pseudo sensitivity coefficient S i is calculated by: (15) S i = S l p e r t u r b e d - S l i n i t i a l S l i n i t i a l"
4,Results and discussion,
5,Normal temperature and pressure conditions,"3.1 Normal temperature and pressure conditions Most fundamental combustion experiments were conducted under normal temperature and pressure condition, numerical results were validated against those experimental results and shown to be accurate at this situation. Therefore, the hydrogen addition methane premixed combustion is firstly investigated under normal temperature and pressure condition. In the following section, the HiPj in the pictures denotes the j-th global pathway for i% hydrogen addition fraction conditions. For instance, H0P6 (CH4 → H2O) means the sixth global pathway for 0% hydrogen addition fraction, in which pathway the CH4 directly convert to H2O. Fig. 1 gives the profiles of several essential species inside the flame front in the upper part, the fraction of H flux passing through the six highest-ranked global reaction pathways in the middle section and the global pathway (GP) possessing the maximum net radical production and consumption rate in the lower part. In the premixed flame, the highly active radical generated at the high-temperature region could diffuse back to the low-temperature region. As shown in the picture, the H0P6 directly converts the reactant to the product, and dominates the CH4 consumption at the preheat layer through the reaction CH4 + OH <=> CH3 + H2O. The activation energy of this reaction is relatively low, which makes it easy to occur. Hence, H0P6 helps accumulate the CH3 radicals and preheat the reactant. With temperature further increases, the mole fraction of oxygen-contained radicals such as CH3O2 and CH2O sharply raised in the intermediate temperature region, corresponding to the increasing dominancy of H0P2. The reactions of those radicals also possess low activation energy, several CH3O2 related reactions even have zero activation energy. These radicals play an important role in the low and intermediate temperature chemistry. They accelerate early radical pool growth and release much energy. H0P4 and H0P5 include extra conversion from CH4 to H2 or CH3. These GPs do not show significant influence until the mole fraction of H2 or CH3 reaches their maximum value. H0P1 is a C2 reaction pathway often appear at the fuel-rich conditions and produce the precursor of soot. It reaches peak value just near the maximum CH3 concentration position through the reaction CH3 + CH3(+M) <=> C2H6(+M). This GP holds zero D GP in the high-temperature since C2 species do not survive in this regime at the stoichiometric condition. It is known that the most critical reaction affecting laminar burning velocity (LBV) and the combustion process is H + O2 <=> O + OH, but due to the relatively higher activation energy, the relevant GPs begins to show their impacts only near the flame downstream where the temperature is high enough. Another important reaction for hydrocarbon combustion is CO + OH <=> CO2 + H, which is responsible almost exclusively for converting CO to CO2 [44]. H0P3 associated with highly active H and OH, achieves its maximum value in the high-temperature region. Since H and OH have a positive relation with LBV, it is evident that burning velocity will increase when D GP of the GP associated with H and OH is high. However, under the current condition, the competition of each GP leads to the relatively low D GP of H0P3 in low and intermediate temperature. Consequently, the LBV of CH4 is low. Moreover, as is shown in the lower part, the GP producing most active radicals (including H, OH and O) is via the hydrocarbon radicals CH2O and HCO, and the GP consumes most active radicals by producing stable H2. Hence, before hydrogen addition, the production of H2 actually impedes the expansion of radical pool. The radical concentration is low at CH4/air flame due to the consumption of the radicals is substantially higher than the production. Besides, the back-diffusion of active radicals is presented more obviously in the R Gp picture. The peak value of GP producing maximum radicals is located at the downstream of flame while the peak value of GP consuming maximum radicals is located close to the upstream, which indicated the position of radicals conversion. Fig. 2 depicts the flux global reaction pathway in CH4/H2/air 1D laminar planar flame at α = 20%. After hydrogen addition, the flame structure does not show an obvious change, except for the variation of H2 mole fraction. H2 is consumed before an observable rise of temperature through H20P6. This is because the diffusing O and OH in the preheat zone react with hydrogen and produce the H radical. Thanks to enough concentration of H2 and H at upstream, HO2 could appear at the intermediate-temperature region by the reaction H + O2(+M) <=> HO2(+M). However, since HO2 is relatively inactive, these reactions could be competitive with the chain-branching reaction. Similar competition of H20P6 may lead to a decrease in LBV. Meanwhile, since the fraction of H2 is still low, two other GP: H20P4 and H20P5 perform very low D GP. H20P1-P3 is typical CH4 oxidation GP, and H20P6 is H2 oxidation GP. H20P6 slightly higher than two other GPs of H2, but its maximum D GP is merely around 0.073. However, the maximum D GP of CH4 is 0.454, almost 6.2 times higher than that of H2, indicating that the combustion process still dominated by CH4 chemistry. The GP involving oxygen-contained radicals show a large influence at upstream and the GP involving H and OH show larger fraction at downstream. GP involving C2 species is not presented for clarity, but it is reasonable these GPs perform fewer fractions since CH3 concentration is reduced after hydrogen addition. The maximum net radical production and consumption GP are also consistent with that of CH4/air flame. The effects of hydrogen addition in the current condition are mainly caused by the increase of active radicals. This fact was also found in previous chemical kinetics analysis of CH4/H2/air combustion when α between 0 and 40% [45] and could explain why the LBV increase nearly linearly for small mount hydrogen addition. But it is interesting to note that in H20P5, H2 firstly converts to the hydrocarbons and then consumed in a similar way with initial CH4. This GP does not exist in pure fuel combustion. The variation of the important species mole fractions, D GP and R GP at α = 80% are shown in the Fig. 3 . At large α, the GP of H2 oxidation begins to dominate the combustion process. Due to the abundant active radicals, H80P4 shows large D GP around the entire flame surface even in the low-temperature region, the D GP is higher than 0.3 in the flame zone. H80P6 associated with HO2 show its peak value at upstream, which is the same with H20P6. H80P1 - H80P3 are the typical CH4 oxidation GP similar to α = 20%, but due to the competition between GPs of H2 oxidation, their influence decrease with hydrogen addition. However, compared with α = 20 % where GPs of H2 is very limited, the contribution of GPs of CH4 at α = 80 % are still high enough to impact on fuel oxidation. The GPs involving hydrocarbons slow down the combustion process, which is the reason why hydrogen content is as high as 80% but the LBV is nearly half of the pure H2. As a transition regime [25,26], the fuel oxidation is affected by both CH4 and H2 GPs and these GPs competes with each other. There is also a small part of H2 converts back to CH4 through H80P5, resulting in CH4 mole fraction slightly increase before oxidation. It worth noting that H80P5 is a distinctive GP which does not appear at pure CH4 or H2 combustion. The peak value of H80P5 D GP appeared at the flame upstream is near 0.2, which play a role in the oxidation of H2. The conversion step between H2 and CH4 is through the reverse reaction of CH4 + H <=> CH3 + H2, and this reaction also have large sensitivity in pure CH4 oxidation. It means though unique GP exist in CH4/H2/air premixed combustion, but it is still within the reacting system of CH4 oxidation, no extra reactions show big influence in the binary fuel combustion. Similar GPs involving the conversion from H2 to CH4 also performed at α = 20 % , but their contribution of fuel oxidation is negligible. Moreover, as shown in the lower part, in the current condition, the maximum net radical production exceeds the consumption leading to a high concentration of H and OH. The pure H2 oxidation GP (H80P4) producing most radicals. In contrast, the CH4 GP is still in charge of radical consumption. The existence of hydrocarbon related GPs consume lots of radicals, which slows down the growth of radical pools and fuel oxidation. The position of their peak values more approach to each other due to the extended radical production region and enhanced diffusion. The H flux global reaction pathways in CH4/H2/air 1D laminar planar flame at α = 99 % are shown in the Fig. 4 . Though initial fuel only contains 1% CH4, there are several GPs initialed with H2 include hydrocarbon radicals. However, since the mole fraction of hydrocarbons is minimal, the maximum D GP of H99P1 - H99P3 is no more than 0.1. Therefore, these GPs barely affect the whole combustion process. The most reactive H99P6 dominate the H2 oxidation over the whole flame surface from low to high-temperature region, causing increasingly high active radicals mole fraction. Both H99P4 and H99P5 involve the HO2, as we mentioned before, HO2 is a relatively inactive species in hydrocarbon GPs usually appearing in intermediate temperature region, just as H99P4 shown. Nevertheless, in H2 flames, for H99P5, with increasing mole fraction of HO2, it can further react with the H radicals: HO2 + H <=> OH + OH. This reaction again enlarges the racial pool, provides plenty of radicals, promoting the oxidation process. It also could be known in the lower part of the picture, the GP near pure H2 flames performs distinctive behaviors in consumption of radicals. In CH4/H2 blended flames, the GP consuming most radicals does not produce any radicals, but in H2 flame, H99P5 firstly consumes radicals in the low to intermediate temperature region, then produces the radicals in the high-temperature region. Above reasons make the substantially high concentration of active radicals in H2 combustion and further increase the LBV. The conversion distribution of H flux from CH4 and H2 are shown in Fig. 5 . In Fig. 5(a), it could be seen, in all conditions, nearly 60% H flux flows into CH3 and no more than 5% H flux flows into OH, barely affected by hydrogen addition. Conversion of H2O keeps 40% in the low and middle-temperature region in the flame and decreases with increasing α in the high-temperature region. The H atom transferring from CH4 to H2 is through the reaction CH4 + H <=> CH3 + H2. It is reasonable to expect that increasing H2 will make the chemical equilibrium shift towards the reactant direction, which should decrease the conversion from CH4 to H2. However, in contrast, the conversion of H2 increase with increasing α. This counter-intuitive result is because the relative increase of H is higher than the increase of H2 in the high-temperature region, making forward reaction rate higher than the backward reaction rate for CH4 + H <=> CH3 + H2. The H conversion flux of H2 is more complicated than that of CH4. Part of the H2 produced as an intermediate species again converts back to the oxygen-contained hydrocarbons in the intermediate-temperature region and the conversion fraction decrease with increasing α, but these intermediate hydrocarbons are consumed in the same way with pure CH4 flame. H2O takes the place of hydrocarbons at the upstream and remain a high fraction in the intermediate-temperature region. The conversion fraction of H and OH is 50% respectively in the high-temperature region for low α since the almost all H2 at this range is consumed through O + H2 <=> H + OH. However, when the α is high, the fraction of H and OH reduce while that of H2O increase. As we mentioned above, H2 could directly convert to H2O through the reaction OH + H2 <=> H2O + H. This reaction is a chain propagation reaction neither generating or consuming new radicals, but it is an important exothermic reaction providing thermal conditions for H2 oxidation at high α. Since at low α the hydrocarbon-related reactions could provide enough heat for fuel oxidation, but at high α, H2O-related reactions need to be responsible for heat releases, which makes the H2O conversion increase in these conditions. Fig. 6 depicts the maximum mole fraction and transport sensitivity coefficient of main species inside the flame front changing with hydrogen addition mole fraction. Since increasing the L.J diameter will reduce the diffusion velocity of species, for stoichiometric mixtures, either changing the diffusion velocity of fuel or oxygen causes the local equivalence ratio inside flame front shift from the most reactive condition, leading to a lower LBV. Hence, most species show a negative sensitivity coefficient to LBV over entire α. The sensitivity of O2 shows a special tendency with α. The initial positive sensitivity decreases with α and becomes negative after α > 90%. Jayachandran et al. [46] found that increasing the ratio of CH4 diffusion velocity to O2 diffusion velocity ( D C H 4 / D o 2 ) results in an increased LBV for ϕ ≥ 1.0 CH4 flame. The original value of D C H 4 / D o 2 is nearly 1.1. At low hydrogen fraction, a decrease in D o 2 leading to a corresponding change in its diffusion length relative to CH4. Thus the optimized mass distribution of reactant and local equivalence ratio results in the enhancement of reactivity and higher CH4 consumption rate, consequently, O2 shows a positive sensitivity for CH4 dominant regime. A similar analysis could be used to explain the negative sensitivity of O2 to LBV at high α. Due to the extraordinary high diffusion velocity of H2, the D H 2 / D o 2 is already large, decreasing D o 2 futher enlarges this ratio, which results in deteriorated mass distribution and reduced LBV. Except for H2 and H, the sensitivity of other species decreases with increasing α. This is because, for CH4 flame, flame propagation is controlled by the thermal propagation mechanism, which is through thermal energy transported into the low-temperature regions by conduction. On the other hand, for H2 flame, the flame propagation is governed by the active species-diffusion mechanism, which is through the chemical energy carried into the low-temperature regions by hydrogen radical diffusing from the flame fronts [47]. This is verified by the sharply increasing sensitivity of H radical at large α. Also, compared Fig. 6(a) with (b), and (c) with (d), it could be seen, the absolute variation of sensitivity and sensitivity value of most species consists with their maximum fraction changing with α. It is reasonable that the sensitivity of each component relates to their content in the mixtures. Nevertheless, molecular species show lower sensitivity compared with their content. While all radicals show higher sensitivity compared with their content inside the flame. For instance, the maximum mole fraction of N2 is nearly 0.7 for various α, and its sensitivity is no more than 0.6. In contrast, the maximum mole fraction of O is 0.003 at α = 0%, but its corresponding sensitivity could reach as high as −0.046. This is because most elementary reactions occur between radicals, relying heavily on radical distributions resulting from transport. Similar situations also presented in the thermal parameters in the following pictures, which is also due to the importance of radicals in elementary reactions. N2 as a nearly chemical-inert and the most abundant species, it shows the highest sensitivity, because other species need to diffuse through it and the changes in its L.J diameter will influence the mixture thermal conduction. The primary hot products such as CO2 and H2O carrying the thermal energy perform higher sensitivity for low α. However, the sensitivity of H2O shows an opposite trend with its maximum fraction because the transition from two different flame propagation mechanism makes thermal energy transport from hot downstream less influential. In addition, no species perform particularly high sensitivity for CH4/H2 blends, the maximum value of sensitivity always appeared at either pure CH4 or H2 condition. There are no new species whose sensitivity is lower than the threshold (0.01) to show in pure fuel combustion, higher than the threshold in the CH4/H2 combustion. It may because the maximum mole fraction of each species monotonic changes with α and sensitivity is positively related to the maximum mole fraction. The pseudo enthalpy sensitivity of the several vital species is plotted in Fig. 7 . All initial reactants possess positive sensitivity, since increasing the enthalpy of a reactant species will decrease the reverse reaction rate and increasing the enthalpy of a product will increase its reverse reaction rate because the equilibrium is harder to reach. Therefore, increasing the enthalpy of CH4, CH3, O2, H2, CO is in favor of their oxidation and increase of LBV. It leads to a positive sensitivity of these species. Active radicals show negative sensitivity since making them less favorable will reduce their peak concentration and production [42]. An increase in enthalpy of certain species will also affect the heat release during the combustion, which results in changes in flame temperature. As the final product of combustion, increasing the enthalpy of CO2 and H2O will hinder the final oxidation. Meanwhile, it also reduces the heat release of total combustion, leading to a strong negative sensitivity of them. The sensitivity of H and H2O show nonmonotonic but the opposite tendency, even though the maximum mole fraction of both species increased with α. For CH4/H2 flame, many parameters such as Markstein length of spherical flame [30], the entropy sensitivity of OH and H2O to LBV and the heat capacity sensitivity of H2 to LBV, also perform nonmonotonic behavior as shown in Figs. 8 and 9 . The inflection point of all these mentioned nonmonotonic behaviors always occurs near α = 80%, which is believed as a transition regime for hydrogen blended methane mixtures. Unfortunately, it is not clear whether there is an intrinsic connection between those characteristics. The non-monotonically changing species show higher sensitivity for blended fuel mixtures than that of pure fuel mixtures, which may be paid more attention in the modeling of CH4/H2/air flame. However, since the variation of sensitivity from pure fuel to blended fuel is marginal (no more than 0.02) and they are also important for pure fuel combustion, hydrogen addition does not alter their status in combustion. The entropy pseudo sensitivity of important species changing with α is shown in Fig. 8. Contrary to the effects of Enthalpy, increasing the entropy of a species will cause the species easier to reach equilibrium, and this effect is more obvious with increasing temperature due to the relation between entropy and Gibbs free energy. Therefore, for most species whose sensitivity to enthalpy is positive, the sensitivity to entropy is negative and vice versa. The trend of entropy sensitivity varying with α is also similar to that of enthalpy but with a different absolute value. It is to note, as a reactant, CH4 does not show significant sensitivity to entropy. Under all the α, the sensitivity of CH4 is no more than 0.01. Because the effects of increasing entropy are enlarged in the high-temperature region, LBV is not sensitive to the entropy changes of CH4, which mostly existed in the flame low-temperature upstream. Instead, as we discussed in GPA, most CH4 oxidation must pass through the CH3, making CH3 take the place of the role of CH4, possessing significant sensitivity. Similar results for heat capacity also presented in Fig. 9, where the heat capacity sensitivity of CH4 is negligible (and hence not shown in the picture), but that of CH3 gives a massive impact. H2 is also a fuel component, however, due to the high diffusion velocity, H2 could also present in the high-temperature region. The increased mole fraction of H2 results in a rising sensitivity. Fig. 9 plots the heat capacity pseudo sensitivity of important species changing with α. LBV is positively related to flame temperature [44], independently increasing mixture heat capacity results in lower flame temperature. Therefore, it is expected to have a negative heat capacity sensitivity to LBV for all species. Nevertheless, some species show positive sensitivity, such as H and CO2. This could be explained by the fact that increasing heat capacity will also increase both enthalpy and entropy of a species according to Eqs. (13) and (14). Enthalpy and entropy have an opposite influence on Gibbs free energy, hence partially canceling the impact of each other, but the net influence of entropy is more obvious. Therefore, for the minor species do not largely contribute to the averaged mixture heat capacity, their patterns changing with α follow the entropy sensitivity but with lower absolute values. For the major species such as N2, O2 and H2, which largely contributes to mixture heat capacity, their patterns are controlled by the relative fraction in the mixtures. The maximum mole fraction N2 does not have a conspicuous change. However, the major species, including N2, perform a decreasing sensitivity with increasing α. Under the current initial condition, the difference between the flame temperature of CH4 and H2 is merely around 100 K, but the LBV of H2 is several times higher than that of CH4. It indicates that the LBV dependence on flame temperature for H2 flame is weaker than for CH4 flame. Therefore, the heat capacity sensitivity will be smaller in H2 flame, which explains the rapidly decreasing sensitivity of N2 at large α."
6,Elevated pressure conditions,"3.2 Elevated pressure conditions Most practical combustion devices are operated at elevated pressure conditions for high thermal efficiency, where the chemical, thermodynamics and transport properties are distinct from normal pressure. In this section, the simulation was extended to cover those conditions. Many studies have shown there is a positive or even linear relation between the maximum concentration of active radicals (H, OH and O) in flame zone and the LBV [48,49]. Therefore, two GPs producing and consuming most radicals under each condition were quantified by R GP and shown in the Fig. 10 to understand the effects of pressure variation on premixed combustion. For both α, the absolute value of R GP of each GP is increased with increasing pressure due to the enhanced reaction rate under high-pressure condition. The peak R GP of the GP producing most active radicals for α = 20% increases from 0.00219 mol∙(m3·s)−1 under 1 bar to 0.0625 mol∙(m3·s)−1 under 20 bar conditions, increased nearly 28.5times, but the peak R GP of the GP consuming most active radicals decreased from −0.00605 mol∙(m3·s)−1 to −0.308 mol∙(m3·s)−1, which is nearly 50.9 times. Similar results are also shown at α = 80%. It means the consumption rate of radicals is more sensitive to pressure changes compared with production rate, leading to the decreasing concentration of active radicals at high pressure and lower LBV. In addition, the relative position of radical consumption and production remain unchanged when pressure increase, even though the flame zone becomes much thinner at elevated pressures, the active radicals are meanly produced at the downstream side and most consumed at upstream. The difference between α = 20% and α = 80% is shown by the GPs under difference pressure. For α = 20%, the most important GPs relating to radicals do not change with pressure, which are typical methane oxidation reaction pathways, only their R GP are increased. It could be seen, three GPs go though the CH4 → CH3 → CH2O step, producing numbers of active radicals. The competition of HCO dissociation producing H and its reaction with O2 producing HO2 is particularly important for methane LBV prediction[50]. For α = 80%, the respond of the reaction system to pressure variation is more complex. Under all pressure conditions, the most important GP is H2 → H → OH → H2O. It is a global pathway directly related to the rate-limiting reaction of burning velocity H + O2 <=> O + OH. The GP produces second most radicals at 1 bar is from the H2 back to the CH4 and CH3, but in higher pressure, aldehyde and alcohol begin to show their importance in both radical production and consumption. Under 20 bar condition, the GP H2 → H → HO2 → H2O2 → OH → H2O is a pure H2 oxidation GP without hydrocarbons, which plays a leading role in radical consumption. The transition of GP at α = 80% with pressure comes from the branching reaction nature of H2 reaction system, similar to the well-known explosion limits of H2-O2 [44]. This results also verify the previous study [25] and our discussion on the domination of CH4 and H2 chemistry at different α. The maximum mole fraction and transport sensitivity for several species at α = 20% and α = 80% are shown in Fig. 11 . The sensitivity threshold of species to show is chosen as 0.01. As shown in Fig. 11, since the peak mole fraction of reactants such as CH4 and O2 locate at the inlet, their maximum values keep constant with varying pressure. The major products such as CO2 and H2O slightly increase due to the thermodynamic equilibrium shift by pressure. Nevertheless, the mole fraction of active radicals and intermediate species significantly decrease with increasing pressure. This is because the increase in consumption rate is higher than the increase in production rate under higher pressure as we mentioned above. For most species, the transport sensitivity increases with increasing pressure, indicating the transport parameters of major species have more influence on LBV at higher pressure, hence, more attention should be paid to these parameters in modeling high-pressure chemsitry. However, the sensitivity of active radical H and O slump with pressure. It could be due to the significant decrease in their maximum mole fraction inside the flame zone. Meanwhile, under a higher pressure condition, the dependence of energy transport by these radicals could be reduced due to the thinner flame zone and enhanced diffusion velocity of other species. The positive and negative sensitivity changes of H2 and CO could be caused by the differential diffusion properties of the mixtures changed by pressure as we discussed in Fig. 6. Though the peak mole fraction of OH is reduced, its sensitivity increase with increasing pressure, it may result from the important role played by OH in high-pressure chemistry. The rank of species sensitivity is almost the same in both α = 20% and α = 80% flame even at high-pressure, which means the there are not particular species which only possess large sensitivity for binary fuel mixtures. Fig. 12 plot the enthalpy pseudo sensitivity of important species changing with initial pressure at α = 20% and α = 80%. Enthalpy sensitivity of most species increases with pressure, and sensitivity changing with pressure is similar between different α. Due to the enthalpy of species directly affect the thermodynamic equilibrium, for the reactant such as CH4 and O2 have a positive sensitivity, the product such as CO2 and H2O have a nagetive sensitivity. It implies that the intermediate species whose sensitivity is positive tending to possess the characteristics of reactant, and vice versa. This could be validated by the fact that the sensitivity of CH3 at α = 20% changes from a positive sensitivity at 1 bar to a negative sensitivity at 10 bar and 20 bar, because the reaction pathway shifts from the CH3 step to the alcohol step at high pressure, making the role of CH3 changing from reactant to product. Fig. 13 . plot the entropy pseudo sensitivity of important species changing with initial pressure at α = 20% and α = 80%. Similar to the enthalpy sensitivity, the sensitivity is amplified at high pressure, for α = 20% the sensitivity of H increase from 0.19 at 1 bar to 0.37 at 20 bar, and from 0.07 to 0.22 for α = 80%. There are some species possessing little sensitivity at normal pressure, however, having large sensitivity at high pressure such as CH4 and O. Due to the high-pressure chemistry, OH and O2 also show opposite behavior at different α. Heat capacity pseudo sensitivity under various initial pressures for α = 20% and α = 80% are shown in Fig. 14 . As we mentioned, heat capacity sensitivity of minor species with a lower concentration is actually caused by entropy changes due to the integration relation between heat capacity and entropy. Increasing pressure makes the LBV more sensitive to changes in heat capacity of most species, which implies that LBV is more sensitive to flame temperature at high temperature."
7,Conclusion,"This work adopted the global pathway analysis (GPA) and sensitivity analysis to further understand the laminar premixed CH4/H2/air flame from the fundamental unit of the reacting system, i.e. species and reactions, and explore whether there are any inessential reactions and species in pure CH4 and H2 combustion are particularly important for the blended fuel combustion. The mean conclusions are summarised as follows: (1) Fuel oxidation is dominated by different global pathway (GP) at different hydrogen mole fraction(α) and each GP show their dominancy at different flame temperature region. For α = 20%, the GPs of fuel oxidation are dominated by CH4 chemistry and barely changed by hydrogen addition. The GPs of H2 is negligible, whose peak contribution appeared at the low-temperature region is merely around 0.1, while the maximum contribution of GP of CH4 is around 0.454. The linear increase in burning velocity caused by hydrogen addition is a result of increased active radicals. With increasing α, the GP gradually shift to H2 chemistry. For α = 80%, fuel oxidation is governed by H2 chemistry, the contribution of H2 GP higher than 0.3 over the entire flame surface, which leads to the nonlinear increase in burning velocity. (2) Extra GPs which do not exist in pure H2 and CH4 flame was found in CH4/H2/air flame. These GPs involves the conversion from H2 to CH4, and play a role in fuel oxidation at α = 80% flame. However since the conversion step of H2 to CH4 is through the reverse reaction of CH4 + H <=> CH3 + H2, which is also an important reaction in pure CH4 combustion. These extra GPs are still within the CH4 chemistry. (3) With increasing α, the brute force sensitivity of transport parameter (Lennard-Jones collision diameter) and thermal parameter (enthalpy, entropy and heat capacity) to burning velocity show positive relation with the maximum mole fraction for most species. The species possess small sensitivity in pure both CH4 and H2 combustion also show little influence on the blended fuel combustion. Nevertheless, some species such as H2O, show higher sensitivity to burning velocity in CH4/H2/air flame than in pure CH4 and H2 flame. (4) For α = 20%, the GP producing and consuming most radicals keep unchanged under elevated pressures, while for α = 80%, the GP changes with pressure and show similar behaviors of pressure effects on H2 reacting system. This result further verifies the transition from CH4 chemistry to H2 chemistry with increasing hydrogen addition. (5) For most species, the sensitivity of thermal and transport parameters to burning velocity increase with pressure, indicating more attention should be paid to physical parameters in modeling high-pressure combustion. Nevertheless, similar to normal pressure conditions, no extra species was found merely important for blended CH4/H2 combustion."
