0,Introduction,"In the future, the bio-based sources of raw materials, such as ethanol and glycerol, are expected to be an alternative that replaces traditional petroleum-based sources for the production of intermediate chemicals and then the bio-based consumer products. Bio-ethanol can be cost-effectively produced from the fermentation of a sugar source, and the production often reaches to an excess in some agricultural countries, whereas glycerol is formed as an undesired by-product in the biodiesel production from vegetable oils or animal fat with an alcohol, accounting for 10% of the biodiesel production [1,2]. With the increased availability and reduced costs of glycerol and bio-ethanol, the conversion of these particular bio-based feedstock alternatives in order to economically and environmentally produce some highly valuable bio-based chemicals is especially essential. Various catalytic reactions have been adopted for bio-based feedstock conversion, such as hydrogenolysis [3–5], selective oxidation [6–9], dehydration [10], dehydrogenation [5], condensation [11], and esterification [12]. Since bio-resources are available in their own particular season, in order to operate a bio-based chemical production plant effectively, more than one type of raw materials may have to be supplied and available for selection. The design of such a plant that can support the uses of various customizable biomass-based raw materials should be made for sustainable production. Therefore, the production of various bio-based chemicals can be done by alternatively feeding either bio-ethanol, glycerol, or both of them simultaneously. Many researchers have studied the hydrogenolysis of glycerol in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts in order to produce various value-added bio-based products such as 1,2-propanediol, lactic acid, 2-propanol, acetol, and acetone. Likewise, bio-ethanol can be a reactant for the production of various chemicals such as ethylene [13] and 1,3-butadiene [14], especially ethyl lactate as a specialty chemical formed simultaneously via esterification with lactic acid [15] that is also a co-product from glycerol conversion. Moreover, ethanol can also behave as a hydrogen donor giving off hydrogen via ethanol dehydrogenation, which can be supplied to glycerol hydrogenolysis to produce various valuable chemicals. 1.2-Propandiol (1,2-PDO), a widely-used raw material in food, medical industries, and chemical applications [16], is frequently obtained as the desired product from glycerol hydrogenolysis. Besides 1,2-PDO, some side products such as lactic acid, 2-propanol, acetol, and acetone have also been commonly observed from the conversion of glycerol [3–9], which are important platform chemicals for the polymer, pharmaceutical, and/or food industries. Moreover, ethyl lactate, formed from the esterification of lactic acid with ethanol, is an essential chemical that is widely used in the aforementioned industries, and it is also a raw material for the production of biodegradable polylactic acid. Glycerol hydrogenolysis that refers to C–C or C-heteroatom bond scission in the presence of hydrogen [4,5] has attracted great interest in recent years, and has been adopted with the aim of producing high-quality bio-based chemicals. According to the glycerol hydrogenolysis pathway, the glycerol dehydration or the scission of C–O bond to acetol takes place on acid and/or metal sites, and acetol is then hydrogenated, forming 1,2-PDO [17]. However, this pathway requires a high-pressure hydrogen supply. Therefore, the in-situ generation of hydrogen, which can be simultaneously driven via the glycerol dehydrogenation-to-glyceraldehyde step on basic sites [5,18] and the reforming of glycerol on a metal site, could possibly overcome the problem of costly hydrogen production [19]. Moreover, it was reported that ethanol, a hydrogen-donating solvent, was an attractive alternative for the in-situ hydrogen production via dehydrogenation, which is simultaneously supplied to glycerol hydrogenolysis [20]. Various heterogeneous types of catalysts were used in the glycerol hydrogenolysis for producing 1,2-PDO. Several works claimed that Cu-based catalysts such as Cu/γ-Al2O3 [10], Cu–Al oxide [4,21], Cu–Ni on Al2O3 and ZSM-5 [19,22], Ni/Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 [23], Cu–Co/Al2O3 [24], and Cu–Mg–Al oxide [20] provided superior performance in terms of the selectivity of the hydrogenolysis reaction. In addition, copper-based catalysts such as Cu2O/SiO2 [25], Cu/ZrO2 [26], and Cu–Ni/SiO2 [27] have also been found as good catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethanol. Therefore, Cu catalysts appeared to have the good activities on the hydrogenolysis of glycerol in the presence of H2, hydrogen production from glycerol reforming [19], and ethanol dehydrogenation [25]. Moreover, the dispersion and/or the surface area of exposed Cu on a catalyst surface also were reported essential to the activity of glycerol hydrogenolysis [20], whereas a MgAl-LDH partially substituted with Cu was proven to possess high Cu dispersion and specific surface area than Cu-impregnated Mg–Al catalyst, which can effectively improve the catalytic performance on glycerol hydrogenolysis without external H2 [20]. In recent years, layered double oxides (LDOs), derived from layered double hydroxides (LDHs), such as Cu0.3Mg4.76Al- [20], Cu-Al- [4], Cu0.4/Zn5.6Al2- [28], and Zn–Ni–Al- [29] LDOs were employed in the glycerol hydrogenolysis reaction, due to their specific properties, such as specific acid-base pairs, homogeneity in the distribution of metal cations, and high surface area [30–32]. Especially, the MgAl-LDO catalysts possess both acidic and basic sites from the acid-base pairs (Mg2+-O2- and Al3+-O2 pairs) with different densities and strengths that have potential to drive the conversion of glycerol [33]. In addition, the studies suggested that highly-dispersed Cu in the LDH materials was considered to lead to the high catalytic activity for the glycerol hydrogenolysis [20]. In summary, copper-based catalysts played significant roles in enhancing the glycerol hydrogenolysis activity [28] and producing H2 from reforming of glycerol [4,19]. In addition, they were also active for ethanol conversion since ethanol itself can be dissociated on the Cu sites, forming a variety of its own products [25]. Furthermore, owing to the fact that ethanol can also behave as a hydrogen donor via dehydrogenation, giving off hydrogen that can be supplied to the glycerol hydrogenolysis pathways, the integrated route of glycerol- and ethanol-based chemicals synthesis is worth being investigated for future sustainable production from renewable resources. In this work, the Cu0.3Mg1.7Al-LDO was therefore employed as a catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol without external H2 source on the account of co-feeding with ethanol as a H2 donor. The objective of this study was to scrutinize the integrated pathways of glycerol conversion to bio-based chemicals over the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7Al-LDO catalyst in the situation where ethanol was co-fed as a hydrogen donor and a co-reactant. In order to achieve such a goal, the activity of the catalyst was also monitored as a function of reaction time under identical conditions without external H2. In addition, the Cu species and their roles on the surface were discussed."
1,Experimentals,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Mg2Al-LDH was prepared using co-precipitation method [34]. First, the solutions of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (0.350 mol) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (0.175 mol) were mixed to make a homogeneous solution with 700 ml DI water. Then, the Na2CO3 solution (0.35 mol in 700 ml DI water) was added into the nitrate solution, and pH was controlled at about 10 using 4M NaOH solution. The sample was next aged at room temperature for 16 h, and then the precipitate was filtered, washed until pH 7, and dried in an air oven at 65 °C overnight. Finally, the Mg2Al-LDH was calcined at 500 °C for 5 h in air. The resulting calcined LDO was named as “calcined Mg2AlO”. Likewise, the Cu0.3Mg1.7Al-LDH was also prepared using co-precipitation. The aqueous solutions of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (0.2975 mol), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.0525 mol), and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (0.175 mol) were mixed to make a homogeneous solution. Next, the LDH synthesis steps were repeated as described previously. The obtained Cu0.3Mg1.7Al-LDH was next calcined at 500 °C in air. The Cu–Mg2Al-LDO was named as “calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO”. Prior to use, the Cu catalyst was reduced at 500 °C in H2 before tested in the catalytic reaction. The reduced catalyst was named as “reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO”."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Bruker X-Ray diffractometer system (Rigaku, SmartLab) was employed to examine the morphology of catalysts. The detector scanned the peak position from the sample as a function of 2θ by starting at the 10° to 50° (2θ) range and a scan speed of 0.02° (2θ)/0.6 s. The data from XRD were analyzed and recorded. X-Ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) was employed to identify and determine the concentrations of elements present in the samples. Surface area analyzer (Quantachrome, Autosorb-1MP) was used to determine the pore size, total pore volume, and specific surface area of catalyst, using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) technique. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Thermo Scientific TALOS F200X (FE-TEM) at the Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI), Thailand, and elemental mapping was recorded using an EDX detector. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using the AXIS ULTRADLD to determine the oxidation states of the calcined and reduced samples. All peaks were calibrated from referring to the C1s spectrum located at 284.8 eV. Temperature Programmed Desorption/Reduction/Oxidation analyzer (TPDRO), BELCAT II, offers the ability of the temperature desorption of NH3 and CO2 to determine the acidity and basicity, respectively, of the calcined and reduced catalysts. The catalyst was pretreated in He (50 cc/min) at 450 °C for 60 min, and then pre-adsorbed the 10% NH3/He or 99.995% CO2 at 100 °C for 30 min. After that, the temperature was increased to 650 °C at 10 °C min−1, and later held for 30 min with He (30 cc/min). In addition, H2 chemisorption was employed to quantify the amount of H2 adsorption on metal sites of the catalysts for the determination of Cu dispersion on the reduced catalysts. The reduced catalysts were pre-treated with flowing nitrogen at 450 °C for 1 h, and cooled down to 40 °C. Then, the temperature was heated to 800 °C with 10 °C min−1 under 5% H2/N2 gas. The H2-TPR measurement was also performed using BELCAT II. Typically, a sample was pretreated in N2 at 500 °C for 30 min and then cooled to 30 °C. Subsequently, the N2 flow was switched to 5% H2/N2 gas. The catalyst was then heated from 30 °C to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, and simultaneously the amount of hydrogen consumption was detected by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was performed at the Beamline 2.2 of the Siam Photon Laboratory, Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI), Thailand. Time-resolved Cu K-edge XANES spectra were acquired in-situ during a reduction condition in the transmission mode using a Si (220) bent-crystal monochromator with the NMOS linear image sensor detector. The calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst was first heated under a flow of 10% H2/N2, from room temperature to 500 °C with the heating rate of 5 °C/min. The composition of Cu species on a catalyst was determined from Linear combination fitting (LCF) available in the ATHENA program with the assistance of the reference spectra of known species (standards); that are, Cu foil, Cu2O, and CuO to fit an unknown sample spectrum."
4,Catalytic activity testing,"2.3 Catalytic activity testing The catalytic activity testings were carried out in a Model 4576 PARR reactor equipped with a stirrer with a speed and an automatic temperature control (PARR 4843 controller). Glycerol (99.5%) was purchased from Quality Reagent Chemical (QRëC™), and 99.5% bio-ethanol was provided by Sapthip Co., Ltd. A 40 mL of a reaction mixture (either pure 99.5% glycerol, 20% (%wt.) bio-ethanol in glycerol, or pure 99.5% bio-ethanol) and 1 g of a catalyst were loaded together into the reactor since the beginning. Then, N2 was purged into the system to remove the remaining air for 30 min. The experiments were conducted at the stirring rate of 400 rpm, and 180 °C under auto-pressure for 4 h without H2 feed. After the continuous stirring for 4 h, the reactor was then cooled to room temperature. The catalyst was removed from the reaction mixture using a centrifuge, and the liquid product was diluted with methanol at the ratio of 1:7.5, and then analyzed using a 1D-Mode Pegasas LECO GC-TOF/MS equipped with the Rxi-PAH (60 m x 0.25 mmID and 0.10 μm film thicknesses) column. Initially, the column temperature was set at 40 °C, kept for 1 min, then increased stepwise starting from 5.5 °C/min to 55 °C, 1.5 °C/min to 90 °C, 4.0 °C/min to 168 °C, and 5.0 °C/min to 210 °C. The components in the liquid products were identified using the Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer (TOF/MS) whereas the concentration of reactants and products was calculated based on the calibrated area under the peaks in chromatograms from the gas chromatograph (GC) of GC-TOF/MS. In addition, the activity of catalysts was also examined as a function of reaction time in the range of 0–10 h under identical reaction conditions in separate experiments. At each run, the same procedures and conditions were repeated as described previously. The glycerol conversion, product selectivity, and yields were calculated using Equations (1)–(3), respectively. (1) G l y c e r o l C o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = [ C o n c . o f G l y c e r o l i n l e t − C o n c . o f G l y c e r o l o u t l e t ] C o n c . o f G l y c e r o l i n l e t × 100 ; where Conc. of Glycerolinlet is the initial concentration of glycerol, and Conc. of Glyceroloutlet is the concentration of glycerol after a chosen reaction time.

5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization For the synthesis of LDO catalysts in this work, the LDHs were used as the precursors. Therefore, the phase identification of Mg2Al- and Cu0.3Mg1.7Al-LDHs was first accomplished using the XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 1 . The characteristic peaks of a hydrotalcite, with sharp and intense (003), (006), (009), (015), (018), (110), and (113) reflections at 2θ = 11.50°, 22.90°, 34.74°, 39.13°, 46.28°, 60.46°, and 61.80° (JCPDF No. 00-014-0191), are present in both LDH samples. They assure that both LDHs were successfully synthesized. Moreover, the enlargement of d-spacing from 7.63 to 7.78 Å was observed on Cu0.3Mg1.7Al-LDH. After calcination at the 500 °C, the XRD patterns of the calcined catalysts are displayed in Fig. 1b. The characteristic peaks of MgO (2θ = 37.12°, 43.04°, 11.50°, PDF No.00-001-1235), Al2O3 (2θ = 35.98°, PDF No.01-078-5519), CuO (2θ = 11.50°, PDF No.01-070-6830), and spinels at 2θ = 36.86° and 44.45° (MgAl2O4; PDF No.01-075-4038 and CuAl2O4; PDF No.01-073-1958) appear in the XRD patterns of calcined Mg2AlO and calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO. It is evident that the removal of water and decomposition of carbonate anions occur; then, the layered structure is collapsed and finally transformed to mixed oxides of the collapsed sheets [35]. Moreover, the chemical states of the calcined catalysts surfaces were analyzed using XPS, as shown in Fig. 2 . For the calcined Mg2AlO catalyst, an Al peak is located at a binding energy in between those of the octahedral Al3+ (74.3 eV) and tetrahedral Al3+ (73.2 eV), while the Mg2+ peak is present in the Mg 2p spectrum (50.1 eV) [36,37]. The structure of calcined Mg2AlO catalyst has been proposed on account of the coordination of Mg–O, Al–O, and Mg–O–Al in the structure [38,39]. Based on the XPS spectra of calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO, the XPS peaks of Mg2+ and Al3+ shift to a higher binding energy. Thus, the partial substitution of Cu has been successfully accomplished due to the interaction of Cu cation with Mg and Al, which can be observed from the shift of Al and Mg XPS peaks. Moreover, the Cu 2p peaks of calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO (Fig. 2c) occur at the binding energies of about 934.4 and 954.2 eV. Based on the spectra of the reference compounds; that are, CuO (Cu2+) and metallic Cu (Cu0) in Fig. 2c, the satellite peaks are observed only on the Cu2+; therefore, this characteristic peak can differentiate between Cu2+ and reduced copper Cu0. In addition, the peaks of Cu2+ (934.4 and 954.2 eV) and Cu0 (932.7, 952.7 eV) species are observed at different binding energies. Therefore, only the peak of Cu2+ species is found in the calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO, suggesting that Cu2+ can partially substitute in the Mg2+ position of the layered structure. The Cu2+ cations could be incorporated in the structure, possibly forming Cu–O–Al or Cu–O–Mg sites. Based on the molar ratio of all elements (Table 1 ), the similar mol % Al of 14.1(±0.6)-14.6(±1.3) is observed on both Mg2Al-LDH and Cu-substituted LDH whereas the mol % Mg decreases from 28.4(±1.4) to 24.1±(0.8) % in the Cu-LDH sample, supporting the incorporation of Cu cation in the layered structure. The H2-TPR profiles in Fig. S1 (in the supplementary material) can indicate the reduction behavior of the calcined Mg2AlO and Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO. For the calcined Mg2AlO, a H2-TPR peak is not observed in the profiles, whereas the calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst exhibits two H2-TPR peaks; that are, the reduction peak of CuO species (200–300 °C) and the reduction peak of CuAl2O4 species (500–700 °C) [40], indicating that the TPR peak is contributed from only Cu atoms. In fact, prior to use as a catalyst, the calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO was reduced at 500 °C for 2 h. Moreover, a new diffraction peak of Cu metal (PDF No.00-001-1241) at 43.5° is found in the XRD pattern of reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst, confirming that the reduction of Cu surely takes place. In addition, the oxidation states of Mg and Al on the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst are similar with those on the calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO one (Fig. 2a–b). Moreover, in the Cu 2p spectrum of the reduced catalyst (Fig. 2c), the peaks at 932.7 and 952.7 eV are evolved, representing Cu0 (orange dot line) and Cu1+ (green dot line) species expectedly located at the same position [41], while the Cu2+ peak and two evident satellite peaks of Cu2+ are still detected at about 934.6 and 954.9 eV (Fig. 2c), suggesting that the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst is composed of Cu0, Cu1+, and Cu2+ species. It is evident that some of the Cu2+ species also exists in the Cu-LDO structure, which is in agreement with the H2-TPR results (Fig. S1) that have suggested the partial reduction of Cu2+ or Cu1+ species. Moreover, it is possible that some of the Cu1+ in the structure or Cu0 on the surface may be partially oxidized in the air to Cu2+, after the sample was brought out of the reducing machine [42,43]. Thus, the relative percentage of Cu0, Cu1+, and Cu2+ on the reduced catalyst, determined using XPS, is calculated to 46.9, 13.6, and 39.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis of in-situ Cu XANES spectra, shown in the supplementary material (Fig. S2), gives the results that coincide with those obtained from XPS and TPR. In addition, the TEM images and elemental mapping of the calcined and reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 a and b, respectively. For the calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO, the elemental mapping results (Fig. 3(a2)) indicate the homogeneous distribution of Cu, Mg, and Al atoms, and also suggest that Cu atoms highly disperse into the layered structure. After reduction, the dislodged copper aggregates are clearly detected in the typical bright-mode TEM image (black spots) in Fig. 3(b2) or in the dark-mode one (white spots) in Fig. 3(b3) with the average particle size of 3.5 nm. Therefore, it can be summarized that Cu2+ and Cu1+ well disperse into the structure, while Cu0 is dislodged from the layer’s structure, and the small-size Cu nanoparticles were formed on the surface after reduction at 500 °C, which is in agreement with the in-situ Cu K-edge XANES results that have suggested the formation of Cu2+, Cu1+, and Cu0 species in the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of catalysts are added in the supplementary material (Fig. S3), and the surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter of the catalysts are presented in Table 2 . The reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst has the higher surface area of 211.3 m2/g with the larger pore volume of 0.8056 cm3/g than those of the calcined Mg2AlO and Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalysts. Both have the average pore diameters in the range of mesoporosity (133.4–152.5 Å). Moreover, the dispersion of Cu metal on the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst surface, determined using H2 Chemisorption, is 68.5%. In addition, the acid-base properties of catalysts, obtained from the NH3- and CO2-TPD, are shown in Table 2 and Fig. S4 (in the supplementary material). The reduction of Cu2+ to Cu1+ and then Cu0 species in the structure of the calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst leads to the slight decrease of total basic density to 0.431 mmol/g with higher strength, while the total acid density is significantly decreased from 0.530 to 0.425 mmol/g with lower strength (Table 2 and Fig. S4)."
7,Catalytic activity,"The catalytic activity on the glycerol hydrogenolysis of calcined Mg2AlO, calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO, and reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalysts was tested using different feed compositions; that are, pure glycerol, 20% bio-ethanol in glycerol, and pure bio-ethanol. The results of conversion, products selectivity, and products yield are shown in Fig. 4 A and B, and Table S1, respectively. The discussion is divided into four parts. Section 4.1 discusses the roles of Cu in Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO on the hydrogenolysis of glycerol, whereas Section 4.2 reveals the effect of bio-ethanol co-feeding on the catalyst activity. Subsequently, the integrated glycerol- and ethanol-based chemical synthesis pathways were scrutinized and proposed in Section 4.3. Finally, in Section 4.4, the activity of the current catalysts is benchmarked with that of other Cu/solid catalysts previously reported in literatures."
8,Roles of Cu in Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO on the hydrogenolysis of glycerol,"4.1 Roles of Cu in Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO on the hydrogenolysis of glycerol Firstly, the activity was tested using the pure glycerol feed to determine the products distribution from glycerol conversion, and the reaction pathways without ethanol intervention were accordingly determined. As a result, the parent calcined Mg2AlO catalyst shows quite low activity (10.4%), and can mainly produce 1,2-PDO (27.1%), acetone (23%), and ethanol (36.6%) selectivity (Fig. 4A(a) and 4B(a)). In addition, the traces of 3-butyn-1-ol (3.1%), allyl alcohol (2.4%), and dioxane compound (1.6%) are co-produced as side products. With using the calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst, the glycerol conversion and 1,2-PDO selectivity are increased to 36.1 and 34.9%, respectively, possibly because the new Lewis acid site, contributed from Cu–O pairs, highly promotes glycerol adsorption, and then glycerol is dehydrated to acetol that is subsequently hydrogenated to 1,2-PDO. Moreover, derivative products such as lactic acid (5.4%), acetol (3.9%), 2-propanol (4.6%), glycerol acetate (15.4%), ethanol (3.5%), and acetic acid (1.8%) are observed as co-products, suggesting that the longer and higher number of reaction pathways are involved and driven by Cu–O pairs. As compared to the calcined Mg2AlO and Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalysts, the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst significantly changes both activity and selectivity. The incorporation of Cu0 onto the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst dramatically increases the glycerol conversion to 66.1%. The tremendous increase in glycerol conversion twice as much, with only a total of 10.3% replacement of Cu (accounting for a total of 60.5% Cu0 and Cu1+) on the catalyst surface, implies that other glycerol conversion reactions occur on the Cu0 metal and Cu1+ sites. It can be postulated that other glycerol conversion reactions could have possibly been driven on the Cu0 metal site, which is likely to be the glycerol reforming reaction [4]. As reported by Mane and Rode [4], the evolution of Cu0 metal is the key factor on the H2 production for facilitating the 1,2-PDO formation from the main glycerol hydrogenolysis route, which the scissions of C–O and C–C bonds are driven by hydrogen. Then, the C–C bond of glycerol is cleaved by hydrogen on the Cu0 metal site, forming to H2 and CO [4]. Moreover, Cu0 can drive the cleavage at also the C–O bond position [19], leading to the glycerol conversion that forms acetol. Subsequently, the in-situ H2 formed from the glycerol reforming is subsequently supplied to the glycerol hydrogenolysis, followed by hydrogenation of acetol to 1,2-PDO. Consequently, the greater 1,2-PDO selectivity (increasing to 48.8%) can also be explained while the other components in the final product, such as lactic acid (5.1%), acetol (4.1%), and acetone (17.9%), remain similar, except glycerol acetate whose selectivity is reduced to 0.8% and ethanol whose selectivity is slightly enhanced from 3.5% to 5.2%. However, hydrogen production is still insufficient to supply to the hydrogenation of acetol in order to form more 1,2-PDO because acetol is still detected at 4.1% in the final product. Therefore, the in-situ formation of hydrogen from the simultaneous reactions of glycerol; likely, glycerol reforming, that is known to be driven by a Cu catalyst, can enhance the production yield of 1,2-PDO to 4.5 times higher using calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO and 11.5 times greater using reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalysts. Ethanol can also be found as a trace component in the products, possibly formed from the hydrogenolysis of 1,2-PDO [44], and it is an evidence of the enhancement of 1,2-PDO production as a result of in-situ H2 formation since its selectivity is increased using both calcined and reduced Cu catalysts. Nevertheless, it should be noted that methanol can be also produced as a trace compound together with ethanol via the hydrogenolysis of 1,2-PDO [44]. In this work, since methanol was used to dilute the sample before analysis using GC/MS, it therefore cannot be detected in the products. In conclusion, the roles of Cu species on the Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalysts are explained as follows. Based on the detected products, the glycerol reaction pathways are catalyzed by the acid-base pairs, including the existing Mg–O–Al pairs and those evolving from the substitution of Cu2+ and Cu1+, and Cu0 metal site of the catalyst. Glycerol itself can be converted on the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalysts in four main parallel pathways; that are, (1) hydrogenolysis, including dehydration driven by the Cu2+, Cu1+ acid sites and Cu0 sites, and dehydrogenation driven by the base sites, (2) reforming of glycerol catalyzed by Cu0, (3) trace condensation, and (4) trace esterification."
9,Effect of bio-ethanol co-feeding on the catalyst activity,"4.2 Effect of bio-ethanol co-feeding on the catalyst activity The catalytic activity was also tested using the pure bio-ethanol feed at the same conditions in order to determine the products from ethanol conversion merely, and to investigate whether or not H2 is in-situ produced from the bio-ethanol dehydrogenation. The conversion and products selectivity are presented in Fig. 4A(c) and 4B(c), respectively. It is found that all catalysts produce acetaldehyde, acetone, ethyl acetate, and 1,1-dietoxyethane as products with 17.1–19.0% ethanol conversion. The formation of acetaldehyde (%Sel. = 50.7–63.3%) confirms that the catalysts can produce H2 via the ethanol dehydrogenation. In addition, the reduced Cu0.3Mg2.7AlO catalyst can more greatly promote H2 formation via the dehydrogenation of 1-ethoxyethanol to ethyl acetate than the calcined Mg2AlO and calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalysts. Therefore, the Cu0 metal site enhances the amount of adsorbed hydrogen on the catalyst surface. It is evident that bio-ethanol has potential to be a hydrogen donor for glycerol hydrogenolysis using reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst. In case of the co-feed of glycerol with 20% bio-ethanol, the conversion and selectivity of catalysts are presented in Fig. 4A(b) and 4B(b), respectively. With 20% ethanol in the feed, using the calcined Mg2AlO catalyst, glycerol conversion slightly increases from 10.4 to 18.9%, and the net 23.3% ethanol conversion is also observed. The calcined Mg2AlO only three products; that are, 1,2-PDO (20.2%), acetone (60.2%), and acetaldehyde (19.6%). In addition, ethanol is not produced as a product since the consumption of ethanol is definitely higher than the ethanol amount formed from glycerol conversion (as explained in Section 4.1). Moreover, using the calcined Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst with the intervention of ethanol in the feed, the glycerol conversion also slightly increases from 36.1% to 41.8%, with the net ethanol conversion of 24.8%. In contrast, for the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst, the glycerol conversion decreases from 66.1 to 49.8% (Fig. 4A(b)), at the net ethanol conversion of 25.6%. It can be seen that the conversion obtained from all catalysts is approximately the same, ranging from 23.3 to 25.6% although it seems that the addition of Cu slightly increases the ethanol conversion. These observations can clearly confirm that bio-ethanol and glycerol can be competitively adsorbed on the catalyst surfaces. In cases of the oxide catalysts, Mg2AlO and Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO, the presence of ethanol in the feed helps increasing glycerol conversion, meaning that the reaction between adsorbed species of glycerol and ethanol can be possible. On the other hands, the competitive adsorption of ethanol on the Cu0 metal site hinders the accessibility of glycerol, resulting in the lower glycerol conversion when ethanol is present in the feed. These can confirm that bio-ethanol can be absorbed on the catalyst surface, and then in-situ H2 is produced via dehydrogenation, to be next supplied to glycerol hydrogenolysis and acetol hydrogenation, and then 1,2-PDO is formed. However, the 1,2-PDO selectivity is reduced to 19.1 and 30.2% using calcined and reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalysts, respectively. The reason is because 1,2-PDO can be continuously oxidized to lactic acid via Cu2+-O2- and Cu1+-O2- Lewis acid sites [7–9], which is then simultaneously reacted with co-fed ethanol to form ethyl lactate as a new product via esterification reaction, as indicated by the formation of ethyl lactate at 13.7–15.5% selectivity with using the calcined and reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalysts, confirming that the acid-base pairs of Cu–O mainly promote the esterification of lactic acid with co-fed ethanol. Therefore, ethanol not only can be a hydrogen donor for glycerol hydrogenolysis, but also behaves as a reactant for producing ethyl lactate via esterification with lactic acid on Cu2+ and Cu1+ sites. However, the other products are also observed; namely, acetol, acetone, ethyl acetate, 2-propanol, and acetic acid in both calcined and reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO cases. Therefore, the presence of the Cu2+, Cu1+, and Cu0 onto the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst significantly produces the bio-based chemicals; namely, 1,2-PDO, lactic acid, ethyl lactate, acetol, and acetone, confirming that both the acid-base sites and metal site are essential. As a result, the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst attains high catalytic performance, exhibiting 66.1% glycerol conversion, and can co-produce bio-based chemicals, especially with 15.0% 1,2-PDO and 6.8% ethyl lactate yields. Therefore, the co-fed ethanol simultaneously plays the roles as a hydrogen donor for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol and a co-reactant for the esterification to ethyl lactate on the calcined and reduced Cu0.3Mg2.7AlO catalyst, which leads to the co-production of 1,2-PDO and ethyl lactate."
10,Catalyst activity as a function of time,"4.3 Catalyst activity as a function of time The catalytic activity of the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst at various reaction time (0–10 h) was studied under the conditions of co-feeding of 20% bio-ethanol with glycerol at 180 °C. The glycerol and ethanol conversion as well as the product selectivity and yield as a function of reaction time are presented in Figs. 5 and 6 . It can be observed that glycerol and ethanol conversion increases rapidly during the first 4 h to 49.8 and 25.6%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5a. Then, the conversion of glycerol and ethanol increases with a slower rate, and then reaches 58.3 and 29.6%, respectively, at 10 h of reaction time. For the product selectivity (Fig. 5b), it is observed that the selectivity of acetol gradually decreases from 7.5 to 4.5% (at 2 h), while the 1,2-PDO selectivity is slightly enhanced, indicating that acetol, originally formed from the dehydration of glycerol, is the primary intermediate for 1,2-PDO formation. In addition, 1,2-PDO and ethyl lactate are formed as the main products at a high selectivity in a short period of reaction time. After 2 h of reaction time, the selectivity of 1,2-PDO is slightly increased to 35.9%, while the selectivities of major by-products, formed from consecutive reactions; namely, acetol (4.1–6.9%), lactic acid (6.8–7.0%), and ethyl lactate (13.5–14.6%) remain almost steady. In addition, glycerol also can be converted to glycerol acetate (5.4–4.3%), together with dioxolane and dioxane (2.9–1.6%) as trace compounds (see Fig. 6). It is observed that the selectivity of all products is steady at 2–10 h. Nevertheless, the yield of 1,2-PDO is dramatically enhanced with reaction time, to 20.2% at 10 h due to the increasing glycerol conversion at the same period of time. Likewise, the yield of ethyl lactate and lactic acid is also slightly enhanced to 8.2 and 3.9%, respectively, whereas the acetol yield is slightly enhanced to 3.7% at 0–8 h, and then drop to 2.4% at 10 h of reaction time. In summary, based on the experimental results, the integrated reaction pathways are proposed with the intervention from ethanol conversion in Fig. 7 . According to Section 4.1, various bio-based chemicals can be formed from glycerol on the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst via four major routes; that are, glycerol hydrogenolysis (a+b), reforming (c), condensation (d), and esterification (e). The glycerol can be converted via hydrogenolysis (a+b) to 1,2-PDO over Cu2+, Cu1+, and Cu0 sites. Subsequently, 1,2-PDO also can be converted to lactic acid via oxidation (f) on the Cu2+ and Cu1+ sites, to ethanol and methanol via hydrogenolysis (g) over Cu2+, Cu1+, and Cu0 sites, and also to acetone via dehydration over acid site. The in-situ H2 is possibly produced from the glycerol reforming (c) over Cu0 site. In addition, glycerol also can be converted to glycerol acetate, together with dioxolane and dioxane as trace compounds, via esterification (e) and condensation (d), respectively. In the integrated pathway, the involvements of 20% ethanol in glycerol, declared in Section 4.2 and in this section above, greatly influences on the in-situ hydrogen production via ethanol dehydrogenation (h) to acetaldehyde on both the basic sites, contributed from Cu2+ and Cu1+, and the Cu0 metal site, which is then further converted to acetone and 1-ethoxyethanol, followed by (i) dehydrogenation of 1-ethoxyethanol to ethyl acetate and 1,1-diethoxy ethane over the Cu0 metal site. Simultaneously, ethanol can be reacted with lactic acid that is previously formed from the glycerol conversion pathways, forming ethyl lactate via esterification (j) on all acid-base pairs. It is hereby noted that the deactivation of this type of catalyst is usually resulted from a change of the oxidation state that can affect to the selectivity of all products. In this case, since the selectivity of all products is quite steady at the reaction time of 2–10 h, indicating that the oxidation of the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7Al catalyst has not taken place significantly. Therefore, it is possible that the deactivation and/or changing the oxidation state did not yet occur in 10 h."
11,Comparison among Cu/solid catalysts,"4.4 Comparison among Cu/solid catalysts The catalytic performance of the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst are summarized in Table 4 in comparison with that of other previously-reported ones tested using a glycerol and ethanol co-feed. The reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO is benchmarked with other reduced Cu/solid catalysts; namely, Cu0.3Mg4.76AlO [20], Rh0.02Cu0.3/Mg5.6Al1.98O8.57 [45], Cu-Co-Al [46], 8Ce/Cu-Co-Al [46], and Cu–ZnO [47]. As a result, the previously-reported Cu/solid catalysts give the slightly-higher glycerol conversion, except Cu–ZnO and Cu0.3Mg4.76AlO-IM catalysts. The higher % amount of glycerol in the feed in this work explains the lower glycerol conversion since a less amount of ethanol co-reactant was available for further conversion. Anyway, the operation without the external N2 and H2 gas in this work provides more economic benefit that makes the production cost-effective process. Although the previously-reported Cu/solid catalysts give the slightly-higher selectivity of 1,2-PDO, it should be however noted that most of the other previous articles reported only three to six chemicals found in the final product, such as 1,2-PDO, acetol, ethylene glycol, methanol, 1-propanol, and 1,3-propanediol, possibly due to the limitation of their GC-FIDs, whereas more than ten to fourteen chemicals were detected in the final product using the GC-TOF/MS in this work. Therefore, the relative selectivity of two major products; that are, 1,2-PDO and acetol, is used to compare the efficiency of all catalysts. Apparently, the relative selectivity of 1,2-PDO with respect to acetol, using the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst, is around 5–10% lower than that of other unpromoted Cu-based catalysts."
12,Conclusions,"In this work, Cu0.3Mg1.7Al-LDHs have been successfully synthesized, and Cu was found to partially substitute in the Mg position of the Mg2Al-LDH. After the Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst was partially reduced at 500 °C, the Cu0, Cu1+, and Cu2+ species were present on the surface. When the catalysts were employed in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol co-fed with 20% ethanol and without external H2, the overall of reaction pathways can be depicted in Fig. 7. Both the acid-base pairs, including the existing Mg–O–Al pairs and those evolving from the substitution of Cu2+ and Cu1+, and the metallic copper site (Cu0) are essential for bio-based chemicals production. The reactions progress sequentially; that are, (a+b) hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO, then (g) hydrogenolysis to glycerol and (f) oxidation of 1,2-PDO to lactic acid, followed by (j) esterification of lactic acid with co-fed ethanol, forming ethyl lactate. Simultaneously, it is possible that lactic acid can be also oxidized further to acetic acid. Moreover, the conversion of glycerol can produce hydrogen via (c) reforming, and glycerol can also be converted to dioxolane and dioxane via (d) condensation, together with glycerol acetate via (e) esterification. In addition, ethanol itself can be converted to acetaldehyde and then to acetone and 1-ethoxyethanol with the liberation of H2 via dehydrogenation (h), followed by dehydrogenation (i) of 1-ethoxyethanol to ethyl acetate and 1,1-diethoxy ethane. In summary, ethanol co-fed with glycerol is utilized as a hydrogen-donating solvent, and also behaves as a reactant in the production of bio-based ethyl lactate and ethyl acetate. Therefore, the key strategies for selectively converting the glycerol and bio-ethanol co-feed to valuable bio-based chemicals such as 1,2-PDO, lactic acid, acetone, and ethyl lactate in one-pot synthesis are (1) the creation of Lewis acid-base pairs, including the existing Mg–O–Al pairs and those evolving from the substitution of Cu2+ and Cu1+ on the surface, which drive the main reactions that are the dehydration and dehydrogenation of glycerol, then (2) the presence of Cu2+ and Cu1+ for the oxidative reaction of 1,2-PDO to lactic acid and the esterification of bio-ethanol with lactic acid to ethyl lactate, and (3) the existence of Cu0 metal site on the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7AlO catalyst for promoting the in-situ H2 production that can directly be supplied the entire system."
