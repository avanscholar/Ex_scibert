0,Introduction,"Environmental pollution and increased energy use represent two serious problems that humans are facing (Ellabban et al., 2014; Fournier et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015). Wastewater contains a wealth of energy resources and the purification of wastewater with simultaneous energy conversion is a promising strategy to resolve the environmental pollution and energy crisis (Villaseñor et al., 2013). Photocatalytic hydrogen production is one of the most important and promising strategies for both wastewater treatment and renewable energy production (Zhang et al., 2013a; Liu et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2012). However, it is quite difficult to photocatalytically purify wastewater and generate hydrogen from wastewater due to the low photocatalytic efficiencies of photocatalysts (Kim and Choi, 2010; Lee et al., 2013). Accordingly, recovering energy from wastewater treatment is an important challenge. The photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) must separate holes and electrons and provide necessary reaction sites (Yang et al., 2013a,b; Sun et al., 2015). Although impregnation of photocatalysts with Pt is effective for HER, Pt is easily poisoned in the presence of organics (Tiwari et al., 2013; Kang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013b; Chang et al., 2015). For wastewater purification and simultaneous energy recovery, it is not sufficient to only consider the half reaction of proton reduction. It is critical to consider the pollutant destruction reactions (Daskalaki et al., 2010). The most important challenge is to separate conduction band electrons away from holes and rapidly transfer the electrons produced from pollutant degradation to site where hydrogen ion is reduced. In our work, a highly conductive reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was used to transfer conduction band electrons more efficiently away from the holes (produced by ZnIn2S4) to hydrogen production sites (quantum dot MoS2 sites on the RGO). The separated electrons and holes can be used for proton reduction and pollutant oxidization, respectively. Accordingly, we have prepared a photocatalyst that can perform all these functions, simultaneously. In recent years, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has attracted considerable attention as a cocatalyst for HERs as a substitute for the noble metal Pt (Liao et al., 2013; Meng et al., 2013; Lukowski et al., 2013; He et al., 2016). MoS2 is a good cocatalyst candidate, but the number of active sites in two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures is very limited (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2014). To solve this problem, we used MoS2 quantum dots (QDs) to create more active sites for enhancing HERs by enhancing edge effects and electrical/optical properties (Wang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015). In this work, a MoS2 QD-decorated hierarchical assembly of ZnIn2S4 and RGO (MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO) was synthesized using simple solvothermal method. The unique hierarchical nanoarchitecture can capture visible light effectively, and provide electron transport tunnel for rapid charge separation/transport to suppress hole electron recombination. Consequently, our photocatalyst furnishes a high density of active sites for organic pollutant degradation and HER. Although MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO has shown high degradation efficiencies on the target pollutants, the hydrogen production varies. This novel photocatalyst system was developed for the effective solar light-driven photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants with hydrogen evolution simultaneously."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Graphite powder, zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(Ac)2·2H2O), indium trichloride tetrahydrate (InCl3·4H2O), dimethylformamide (DMF), ethylene glycol (EG), thioacetamide (TAA), sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and thiourea were obtained from Tianjin Chemical Reagent (Tianjin, China). All reagents and materials were used as received without further purification."
3,Synthesis of graphene oxide,"2.2 Synthesis of graphene oxide Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by an improved Hummers' method. Typically, 180 mL of concentrated H2SO4 (18 mol/L)/H3PO4 (14 mol/L) (volume ratio of 9:1) was added to a mixture of graphite powder (1.5 g) and KMnO4 (9.0 g), and heated to 50 °C under stirring for 12 h. The reaction solution was then dumped into water containing ice cubes (200 mL, 0 °C). After that, 30% H2O2 was added dropwise until the solution color changed to golden yellow. The mixture was centrifuged at 533 G for 15 min. The collected solid was washed with deionized water and absolute ethyl alcohol three times. After freeze drying for 24 h, the GO was produced."
4,Synthesis of ZnIn2S4@RGO,"2.3 Synthesis of ZnIn2S4@RGO A certain amount of GO was dispersed in a solution containing DMF (30 mL) and EG (30 mL) and it was exposed to ultrasound (40 KHz, 40 W/L and 2 h). Then, TAA (0.30 g, 4 mmol), InCl3·4H2O (0.59 g, 2 mmol) and Zn(Ac)2·2H2O (0.22 g, 1 mmol) were added into the GO dispersion under stirring. The suspension was then transferred to a Teflon dish and heated in a stainless steel autoclave at 180 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the products were collected, washed with ethanol and deionized water, and dried at 60 °C for 24 h to obtain ZnIn2S4@RGOx (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5 wt%). We determined that 1 wt% of RGO (x = 1) resulting in the maximum photocatalytic hydrogen production and this wt% was used for all tests."
5,Synthesis of MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO,"2.4 Synthesis of MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO In a typical procedure, 50 mg of ZnIn2S4@RGO1 powder was dispersed in a solution containing DMAc (30 mL) and H2O (30 mL). Then, these amounts of MoS2 precursors (Na2MoO4·2H2O and thiourea) were dissolved in 5 mL of distilled water: (1) 2.34 mg Na2MoO4·2H2O and 0.74 mg thiourea, (2) 3.98 mg Na2MoO4·2H2O and 1.25 mg thiourea, and (3) 5.69 mg Na2MoO4·2H2O and 1.79 mg thiourea. These solutions were added dropwise to the ZnIn2S4@RGO1 solution to obtain 3, 5 and 7 wt% MoS2 on MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO, respectively. After complete mixing, the resultant suspension was transferred to a Teflon dish and heated in the stainless steel autoclave at 150 °C for 10 h. After cooling to room temperature, the products were collected, washed with ethanol and deionized water three times. The washed sample was further dried at 60 °C for 24 h to obtain yMoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO1 (y = 3, 5 and 7 wt %). The preparation procedure of MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO is illustrated in Scheme S1 in Supporting Information."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The morphologies of the samples were characterized using an S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi, Japan), a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100F, Japan) and an atomic force microscope (AFM, SP13800N SPA400, Seiko, Japan). The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra measurements were conducted using a TecnaiG2 F20 S-TWIN atomic resolution analytical microscope. The BET specific surface areas were determined by a Belsorp-Mini II analyzer (Japan). The crystal phases of the samples were analyzed by an X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (XRD, M21X, MAC Science Ltd., Japan). The binding energies of different elements of the samples were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha 1063, Thermo Fisher Scientific, England) with an Al Kα X-ray source. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Cary 300, USA) with an integrating sphere. The time-resolved transient photoluminescence (TRPL) spectrum was obtained using a streak camera (Hamamatsu C10910, Japan). The toxicity reduction of the treated wastewaters was estimated by the light emission of photobacterium Vibrio fischeri, which was recorded with an ultra-high resolution confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM, Nikon, Japan) with 488 nm excitation wavelength. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded with a fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm (Hitachi F-7000, Japan). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the dark was applied to evaluate the conductivity of the as-synthesized samples, and performed in 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI600D, Chenhua, China). We also conducted electrochemical experiments in the dark to study electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution of the catalyst. A glass carbon coated with the catalysts (0.28 mg/cm2) (anode), a Pt wire (cathode) and a Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively."
7,Calculation of frontier electron densities (FEDs),"2.6 Calculation of frontier electron densities (FEDs) All the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed by DMol3 package with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof/Double-Numerical Dasis 4.4 set. All computations converged upon a true energy minimum, which was confirmed by the absence of imaginary frequencies. The cutoff radius was 4 Å. Based on the Frontier Orbital Theory, the electrophilic reaction most likely takes place at the atoms with high values of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), whereas the nucleophilic reaction most likely occurs at the atoms with high values of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (Fukui, 1982). Thus the FEDs of the HOMO and LUMO of compounds were calculated (Yao et al., 2011)."
8,Photocatalytic activity evaluation,"2.7 Photocatalytic activity evaluation The photocatalytic activities of different photocatalysts were first evaluated using H2 production with lactic acid as sacrificial reagent. The photocatalytic experiments were performed in a 100 mL quartz flask at ambient temperature. A 300 W xenon arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300C, Perfectlight, China) was used to match solar light (320–780 nm). The lamp was positioned 20 cm away from the reactor with an average photon flux density of 3.36 × 10−5 E L−1 s−1 (light intensity is 168 mW cm−2). Typically, 50 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 80 mL of 1.3 M lactic acid aqueous solution (10 vol%, pH = 1.68). Before irradiation, the reaction system was bubbled with nitrogen to remove the dissolved oxygen. The produced hydrogen was analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimazu GC2010, Japan)."
9,Photocatalytic pollutant degradation and hydrogen evolution,"2.8 Photocatalytic pollutant degradation and hydrogen evolution The organic pollutant concentration in simulated wastewater was 20 mg/L (rhodamine B (RhB), eosin Y (EY), fulvic acid (FA), methylene blue (MB), or p-nitrophenol (PNP)). The Xiangjiang River water (Changsha, Hunan province, China) contained a COD of 32 mg/L after filtration by a 0.22 μm filter membrane. In a typical experiment, 100 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 80 mL simulated wastewater or Xiangjiang River water. Before irradiation, the reactor was bubbled with nitrogen to remove the dissolved oxygen and maintained in the dark for 30 min to reach adsorption equilibrium. The decrease in organic pollutants concentration with increasing irradiation time reflects the photocatalytic efficiency. The concentration of organic pollutants and their byproducts in simulated waste waters as functions of time were measured. The variation of the organics in the Xiangjiang River water were characterized using a three-dimensional excitation emission fluorescence matrix (3D EEM) (Hitachi F-7000, Japan)."
10,Ecotoxicological evaluation,"2.9 Ecotoxicological evaluation Luminescent bacteria such as Vibrio fischeri, naturally emit light and are used to evaluate toxicity of substances (Farré et al., 2001; García et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2011). Bioluminescence is directly proportional to the metabolic status of the cell. Toxic substances will cause a reduction in the metabolic cellular state, and this reduction results in a bioluminescence decrease. To evaluate the non-specific toxicity, the bioluminescence level was measured on the bacteria. The bioluminescence level could evaluate the inhibition of bioluminescence using Eq. (1): (1) Inhibition efficiency ( % ) = ( 1 − I sample /I control ) × 100 % where Icontrol and Isample represent the luminescence intensities of the negative control and sample, respectively."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Catalyst preparation,"3.1 Catalyst preparation The SEM image shows a curved morphology of ultrathin GO sheets synthesized by the improved Hummers' method (Fig. 1 a). The AFM image confirms that the GO are single-layered sheets with 1 nm thickness (Figs. S1a and b, Supporting Information). The GO was reduced during hydrothermal synthesis of ZnIn2S4@RGO (confirmed by XPS analysis, Text S1 and Fig. S2). The ultrathin reduced graphene oxide (RGO) would act as a conduit for photo-generated electrons from ZnIn2S4. Without using GO growth substrate, pure ZnIn2S4 sheets aggregated into microspheres with a size of approximately 1.0 μm (Fig. S1c). When using GO as growth substrate, ZnIn2S4 sheets were uniformly grown on the RGO surfaces with a sheet-on-sheet hierarchical structure (Fig. 1b and c). The bonds of ZnO on the RGO surfaces ensure a powerful framework for stabilizing ZnIn2S4 (Fig. S3) (Chen et al., 2015). Moreover, ZnIn2S4@RGO presents a larger specific surface area of 132.27 m2/g compared to the 111.43 m2/g for pure ZnIn2S4 (Fig. S4). Obviously, the larger specific area may enhance pollutant adsorption. After loading MoS2QDs, the MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO still kept a sheet-on-sheet hierarchical structure (Fig. 1d and e). The d-spacing of MoS2QDs is 0.27 nm, corresponding to the (100) facet of MoS2 crystals (Fig. 1f) (Dai et al., 2015). The XRD patterns of pure ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-based composites also show the characteristic hexagonal crystal structure of ZnIn2S4 (PDF# 65-2023) (Fig. S5). The elemental mapping images indicate that both MoS2QDs and ZnIn2S4 are dispersed in MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO homogeneously (Fig. S6)."
13,Wastewater purification and energy conversion,"3.2 Wastewater purification and energy conversion The photocatalytic activities of different photocatalysts were first evaluated by H2 evolution reactions with lactic acid as sacrificial reagents. Fig. 2 a shows that the optimal RGO loading in ZnIn2S4@RGO is 1 wt%, and the highest hydrogen production rate is 3.87 mmolh−1g−1. Lower RGO loading led to less separation of electron-hole pairs and excessive RGO loading led to less light absorption of ZnIn2S4 and less exposure of active sites. The improved conductivity of ZnIn2S4@RGO compared to pure ZnIn2S4 indicates that the electron separation and transfer is enhanced by RGO (Fig. S7). Pure ZnIn2S4 possessed a certain catalytic activity due to the unsaturated S defects in ZnIn2S4, which could chelate protons for reduction (Fig. S8). Still, the hydrogen production rates over ZnIn2S4@RGO were much higher than that over pure ZnIn2S4. The results indicate that the hydrogen evolution reactions over ZnIn2S4@RGO were mainly triggered by the electrons at RGO but not at the LUMO of ZnIn2S4. Fig. 2b shows that the optimal MoS2 loading in MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO1 is 5 wt%, with the highest hydrogen production rate being 5.791 mmolh−1g−1. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm was 54.17% (Text S2 and Table S1). Importantly, the photocatalytic activities remained highly stable for HERs after a 30-h time period (Fig. 2c). The 5MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO1 photocatalytic activity was tested in a simulated wastewater using RhB, EY, FA, MB or PNP (Fig. 3 a). The largest H2 amount (45.33 μmol) was produced for RhB degradation after 12 h. No H2 was detected during MB degradation. The degradation efficiencies and TOC removal were 91% and 75% for PNP, 92.2% and 72% for FA, 98.5% and 80% for MB, 98.6% and 84% for EY, and 98.8% and 88% for RhB, respectively (Corganics = 20 mg/L, Ccatalyst = 1.25 g/L, t = 12 h, Ilight = 3.36 × 10−5 E L−1 s−1) (Fig. 3b and c). The degradation and TOC removal efficiencies are inspiring in the absence of dissolved oxygen. Although PNP is considered as a refractory organic pollutant with high redox potential (Honeychurch and Hart, 2007) and the degradation rate became lower with prolonged time (Fig. S9, and Fig. 3d and e), 5 μmol of hydrogen was still achieved simultaneously during PNP degradation after 12 h. The AQEs for hydrogen production at 420 nm were 0.35% for RhB, 0.27% for EY, 0% for MB, 0.06% for PNP, and 0.07% for FA, respectively (Text S2 and Table S1). Additionally, the hydrogen production was not detected in deionized water without any organics or sacrificial reagents (the data are not shown). It indicates that the electrons for hydrogen production was from the oxidation of organics rather than water splitting. In the process of photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and simultaneous H2 production, although the concentration of organics decreased with prolonged irradiation time, the produced intermediates could be further degraded (with TOC removal, Fig. 3c and d) to offer electrons for hydrogen production. So with prolonged irradiation time, the concentration of organics decreased while the amount hydrogen still increased obviously. The results indicate that the as-synthesized photocatalyst is highly efficient for photocatalytic wastewater purification with energy recovery. Our study is the first report for photocatalytic hydrogen production without noble metals as cocatalyst in the presence of refractory organic pollutants. The hydrogen production with MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO in the presence of organic substrates is as effective as photocatalysts with noble metals as cocatalysts (Table S2). PNP is considered to be a hazardous waste and priority toxic pollutant by U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency). To evaluate the non-specific toxicity, bioluminescence level was measured by using the model bacterium Vibrio fischeri. The Vibrio fischeri was exposed to PNP solution after photocatalytic treatment after a certain time (Fig. 4 ). With increasing degradation time of PNP, the fluorescence intensity of Vibrio fischeri in PNP solution increased gradually (Fig. 4a), and the inhibition efficiency decreased significantly (Fig. 4b). The confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) images further show that the toxicity decreased with prolonged PNP degradation time (Fig. 4c). Thus, the proposed photocatalytic process is highly effective in wastewater purification and hydrogen production."
14,Photocatalytic treatment of river water,"3.3 Photocatalytic treatment of river water Photocatalytic H2 production was detected in FA aqueous solution (Fig. 3a). (In general, humic acid, which includes FA, is ubiquitous in natural waters.) We treated Xiangjiang River water using photocatalysis (sampling site is shown in Fig. S10). Three-dimensional excitation emission fluorescence matrices (3D EEMs) (Fig. 5 a and b) were applied to different areas as I-V (Herzsprung et al., 2012), denoting aromatic protein I (EX = 220–250 nm, EM = 280–330 nm), aromatic protein II (EX = 220–250 nm, EM = 330–380 nm), fulvic acid (EX = 220–250 nm, EM = 380–500 nm), soluble microbial metabolites (EX = 250–280 nm, EM = 280–380 nm), and humic acid (EX = 250–400 nm, EM = 380–500 nm), respectively. After photocatalytic treatment for 12 h, all region volumes decreased significantly, indicating the efficient removal of substances in water. The removal efficiencies achieved for aromatic protein I, aromatic protein II, fulvic acid, soluble microbial metabolites and humic acid were 97.4, 76.3, 82.1, 98.4 and 97.3%, respectively (Table S3). The characteristic UV–vis absorbance of the river water at 254 nm (Murphy et al., 2011) decreased from 0.092 to 0.077, and approximately 13.82 μmol H2 was detected after photocatalytic treatment for 12 h (Fig. 5c). The AQE for hydrogen production at 420 nm was 0.10% (Text S2 and Table S1). In addition, the turbidity and COD of the river water were reduced significantly. Accordingly, natural organic matter can be degraded and can produce electron donors for H2 production."
15,"Mechanism of substance transformation, electron flow and energy conversion","3.4 Mechanism of substance transformation, electron flow and energy conversion To study the photocatalytic mechanism, the electronic structures and band gaps of the photocatalysts were investigated (Fig. 6 ). All the photocatalysts show strong visible-light absorption with the absorption edge at about 520 nm (Fig. 6a). Based on the UV–vis absorption spectra, the calculated band gaps are 1.99, 2.16, 2.02, and 2.15 eV for 5MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO1, 5MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4, ZnIn2S4@RGO1 and ZnIn2S4, respectively (Fig. 6b). According to the XPS valence band (VB) spectra (Fig. 6c), the calculated conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) levels are shown in Fig. 6d. The VB levels of the ZnIn2S4-based photocatalysts are more negative than the redox potential of OH−/OH (1.99 eV vs. NHE) (Yang et al., 2013a,b). Therefore, the photo-generated holes would not oxidize OH− to OH for the ZnIn2S4-based photocatalytic systems. Additionally, the photocatalytic degradation of PNP was obviously suppressed in the presence of EDTA-2Na (hole scavenger) while the photocatalytic degradation of PNP showed no change in the presence of t-BuOH (OH radical scavenger) (Fig. S11). Furthermore, we used coumarin (OH radical indicator) to sure whether OH radical production or not by detecting fluorescence compound, 7-hydroxyl coumarin form the reaction between coumarin and OH radical (λem = 460 nm) (Fig. S12). There was no OH radical detected. The results further confirm that the photo-generated holes functioned as the dominant active species for the degradation of organic pollutants. The conduction band (CB) levels of the photocatalysts are more negative than the redox potential of H2/H+, indicating their potential for the reduction of protons to hydrogen. To further determine the contribution of organic pollutants to hydrogen evolution, the energy levels of pollutant molecules were analyzed (Fig. 7 ). The adsorbed dye on the surface of the photocatalyst could be excited to generate e−/h+ pairs by illumination. The LUMO and HOMO levels of RhB (Kato et al., 2005), EY (Abe et al., 2000) and MB (Takizawa et al., 1978) are −1.0 and 1.1, −0.82 and 1.29, −0.25 and 1.61 eV, respectively. Due to the CB levels of RhB (−1.0 eV) and EY (−0.82 eV) are more negative than those of ZnIn2S4 and MoS2, the photo-excited electrons in RhB and EY could be injected into the CBs of ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 or transferred to RGO during HER (Fig. 7a). The highest hydrogen production with RhB degradation is mainly attributed to the most negative CB level of RhB for rapid electron transfer. In contrast, the CB level of MB (−0.25 eV) is more positive than MoS2 QDs (−0.42 eV), resulting in the unacceptable electron transfer from MB to MoS2 QDs. Furthermore, the overlapping of electron cloud in the LUMO and HOMO of MB adversely affects the separation of e− and h+ itself (Fig. 7b). As a result, the H2 production was not detected during MB degradation. During the degradation of PNP as a non-dye substance, the H2 production is low (Fig. 3d–f), due to its high redox potential (0.8 V and −0.5 V) (Honeychurch and Hart, 2007). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first systematic study on the relationship between hydrogen evolution and energy levels of organic molecules as electron donors. The fast electron transfer is required to achieve the synergistic reactions of pollutant degradation and hydrogen evolution. Hence, the time-resolved transient photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra were applied to further elucidate the formation and migration dynamic behavior of photo-generated charge carriers in photocatalysts (Fig. 7c) (Text S3 and Table S4). The average emission lifetime of photo-generated charges decreases from 75.57 ns for ZnIn2S4 to 15.91 ns for ZnIn2S4@RGO1, indicating the rapid electron transfer by RGO. The emission lifetime for 5MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO1 further decreases to 12.05 ns, which is 1.32 and 6.27 times shorter than those of ZnIn2S4@RGO1 and ZnIn2S4, respectively. The shorter decay lifetime indicates faster interfacial charge transfer through non-radiative quenching pathways. The electron transfer rate constants are 4.96 × 107 s−1 and 6.97 × 107 s−1 in ZnIn2S4@RGO1 and 5MoS2QDs@ZnIn2S4@RGO1, respectively. The TRPL decay spectra results further confirm that the MoS2QDs promotes the electron transfer due to the fast electron consumption for proton reduction. A visual description of the electron flow is shown in Fig. 7d. Under irradiation, ZnIn2S4 was excited to generate electrons which were transferred MoS2 QDs on ZnIn2S4 and RGO for hydrogen production. The dye molecules adsorbed on catalysts were also excited under irradiation to produce electrons which were further transferred to the CB of ZnIn2S4 or RGO. And these electrons were subsequently transferred to MoS2 QDs for hydrogen production. Meanwhile, the dye molecules were oxidized and mineralized by the photogenerated holes (h+) to generate electrons for hydrogen production. Additionally, even though there was no the role of dye-sensitization (e.g. only PNP), the electrons from both ZnIn2S4 and oxidation of organic pollutants by photogenerated holes could trigger hydrogen evolution."
16,Conclusions,"In seeking greater sustainability in water resource management, wastewater is now being considered more as a resource than as a waste. This study could present new lines of research on wastewater purification with simultaneous energy production. The results confirm that organic pollutants in wastewater can act as electron donors for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, the solar-driven photocatalyst has good cycle ability in the presence of organic pollutants. Significantly, the natural organic substances in river water could be efficiently removed with considerable hydrogen production. Photocatalytic process offers potential for purifying wastewater and converting solar energy into clean hydrogen energy at the same time. Despite all this, some factors should be considered in actual wastewater on photocatalytic process. The effect of complex constituents in actual wastewater on photocatalytic process need to be further investigated. Also, the concentration of organic substances may be much lower than mg/L, which requires photocatalysts to possess an ultra-high adsorption capacity."
