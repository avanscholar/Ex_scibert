0,Introduction,"According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [1], CO2 emissions from energy use are projected to grow 40% to 110% between 2000 and 2030. Transport activity, a key component of economic development and human welfare, is nowadays responsible of a large part of these emissions (23% in 2004, with about three-quarters coming from road vehicles), since virtually all (95%) of transport energy comes from oil-based fuels, and it is increasing around the world as economies grow. Among the mitigation strategies, the IPPC proposes the use of biofuels, electricity and hydrogen to reduce the transport greenhouse gases emissions. Regarding biofuels, although ethanol will continue to account for about 75% of the global biofuels supply between 2010 and 2035, biodiesel is becoming attractive for diesel engines and its consumption is planned to quadruple during this period in the OECD countries, reaching around 43Mtoe/year [2,3]. One of the main problems associated with biofuels is still the production costs, which can be reduced if residues of the production processes are converted into valuable co-products [4]. In biodiesel plants, around 10wt % of the vegetable oil or animal fat is converted to glycerol as a by-product [5] and the excess produced in the biodiesel industry is leading to a decrease in glycerol prices so that it is now considered as a waste. Besides, crude glycerol obtained in this process contains also other compounds, mainly water (6–26%) and methanol [4], and therefore it needs to be purified by distillation to be used in industries such as food and pharmaceuticals, a costly process that makes it uneconomic due to the low price of glycerol [6]. Thus, since glycerol production is expected to increase concurrently with the biodiesel industry, alternative utilization routes need to be explored in order to reduce biodiesel production costs [3]. Taking into account that the use of hydrogen is another mitigation strategy proposed by the IPCC, a promising option is glycerol catalytic steam reforming to produce hydrogen [5–9], which can be used in various devices for energy generation with no emissions aside from water. Moreover, both methanol and water contained in crude glycerol are also reactants in the steam reforming process, which may significantly contribute to cost reduction in the valorization of this waste. Stoichiometrically, the glycerol steam reforming reaction for hydrogen production can be represented as follows: (1) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H 2 O → 3 CO 2 + 7 H 2 Δ H = 128 kJ/mol However, the process is accompanied by secondary reactions leading to the formation of by-products and thus decreasing hydrogen yield. Typically, a mixture of CO2, CO and methane go together with the hydrogen in the gas stream as a consequence of the water–gas shift and methanation reactions, but the converted glycerol may not completely produce gaseous products and it gives rise to acrolein, dihydroxyacetone, hydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetic acid… through thermal decomposition, dehydrogenation and dehydration reactions [9,10]. Additionally, coke formation can occur, which is one of the main problems for catalyst deactivation together with sintering of metal particles. Using a suitable catalyst not only can increase hydrogen production, but it also influences the reaction pathway and then secondary products distribution. During catalytic reforming, glycerol must be dehydrogenated and the C–C bonds must be broken, while C–O bond cleavage is undesired since subsequent hydrogenation would result in the formation of smaller alcohols and alkanes, which indicates that glycerol is expected to have similar characteristics as its alcoholic congeners in the reforming processes [5,7,11]. Up to now noble metal (Pt, Ru, Rh, Ir), nickel and cobalt catalysts have been investigated for glycerol steam reforming [5,9], but the most frequently used metal in steam reforming processes (even in current oil refineries) is nickel, which has demonstrated high activity in these reactions and also has relatively low cost [12,13]. Nickel possesses hydrogenation/dehydrogenation capability and causes bond breaking in the following order: O–H, –CH2–, C–C and –CH3 [11]. The choice of a catalytic support is also an important task because it affects: (i) the active surface area by dispersing the metal over the carrier surface; (ii) the stability of the catalyst via metal-support interactions, which may inhibit sintering, and (iii) the reaction pathways according to redox or acid-base properties of the support. Silicate-based mesoporous molecular sieves with stable frameworks (MCM-41, MCM-48, SBA-n, MSU-n) are materials with extremely high surface areas and unique pore size tuning, which make them suitable as supports for accommodating metal particles for catalytic applications [14]. Concretely, SBA-15 has demonstrated excellent characteristics as the support of active species for steam reforming of methane [15,16], methanol [17,18] and ethanol [19–24]. However, the siliceous nature of this material involves presence of acidic sites. Deactivation of Ni-based catalysts in steam reforming of glycerol, in the manner of other hydrocarbons, has been mainly attributed to carbon deposition, where acidic supports tend to dehydrate glycerol, which yields undesired coke precursors and can plug the reactor [9,10,25]. This problem could be overcome by adding alkaline elements such as K [26,27], Na [27,28], Ca or Mg [22,29,30] to the catalyst, in order to provide weakly basic properties and even improve metal-support interaction. Based on the above considerations, we have studied the effect of Mg and Ca incorporation into Ni/SBA-15 on its catalytic performance for glycerol steam reforming. Catalytic stability has been aimed with special emphasis by using hard reaction conditions strengthening deactivation effects and thoroughly characterizing the used catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Catalysts containing 7wt% Ni were prepared over SBA-15 mesoporous material. The synthesis of SBA-15 was carried out by hydrothermal method as described in literature [19,31] with subsequent air calcination at 550°C in static conditions for 5h at a heating rate of 1.8°C/min was carried out to eliminate the template agent. Then, the incorporation of promoters to the calcined SBA-15 was carried out by incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous solutions of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and Ca(NO3)2·6H2O (Aldrich) with the proper concentration to obtain 10wt% of MgO or CaO in the modified support (nominal Mg and Ca contents in the support are 6.0 and 7.1wt%, respectively). These modified supports were characterized by TG analyses in order to select the temperature of 600°C, high enough to decompose Mg and Ca precursors during the calcination step. Finally, the active phase was added to the support by incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous solutions of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Scharlab) with the proper concentration to obtain the desired Ni loading. Impregnated catalysts were dried overnight at 110°C and calcined at 550°C for 5h with a heating rate of 1.8°C/min. The materials were named as Ni/P/SBA-15, where Ni indicates the presence of nickel and P represents the promoter element (Mg or Ca), depending on the case. The activated catalysts were obtained after reduction, following the procedure described in Section 2.3."
3,Supports and catalysts characterization,"2.2 Supports and catalysts characterization Calcined, reduced and used catalysts, as well as the supports, were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), nitrogen physisorption, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and HCNS elemental analysis. XRD was used to check the porous mesostructure of the supports and to determine crystalline phases in the prepared materials (according to the JCPDS index). The mean sizes of the metallic crystallites and the graphitic domains formed on the used catalysts were calculated by applying Scherrer equation. Data were acquired on a Philips X’Pert PRO diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation, a 2θ increment step of 0.020° and a collection time of 2s. ICP-AES technique was used to determine the actual content of metals in the catalysts. Analyses of the samples, previously dissolved by acidic digestion, were performed on a Varian VISTA-PRO AX spectrophotometer. Textural properties were measured by N2 adsorption/desorption analyses at 77K, using a Micromeritics TRISTAR 3000 sorptometer. Prior to the nitrogen-adsorption, samples were outgassed under vacuum at 200°C for 4h. Surface areas and pore size distributions were calculated according to BET and the BJH methods, respectively. TGA measurements were performed in airflow on a TA instruments SDT 2960 thermobalance with a heating rate of 5°C/min up to 1000°C, in order to determine the temperature at which metal precursors were decomposed and to quantify and characterize the carbon deposits found on the used catalysts. H2-TPR measurements were performed on a Micromeritics AUTOCHEM 2910 in order to analyze the reducibility of the samples and obtain information about metal-support interaction. Catalysts were placed in a fixed-bed quartz tube under 10% H2/Ar flow (35mL/min) with a heating rate of 5°C/min from 80 to 980°C. Effluent gas is forced to flow through a cold trap to remove water produced before reaching the thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Samples were previously degassed under dry argon flow (35mL/min) at 110°C for 30min with a heating rate of 15°C/min. TEM micrographs were obtained on a Philips TECNAI 20 microscope equipped with W filament and an accelerating voltage of 200kV, with a point-to-point resolution of 0.27nm. The apparatus has also the possibility to perform elemental microanalysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Samples were prepared by powder dispersion of the material without grinding (to avoid any damage of the sample) in acetone and subsequent deposition on a copper grid with a carbon support. The elemental C and H analysis of the used samples was performed with the automatic elemental analyzer Elementar Vario EL III using He as the carrier gas. The sample was burned with oxygen at 1150°C into a combustion tube filled with WO3. The generated gases (CO2, H2O, NO x , O2) stream was reduced into a tube filled with active copper at 850°C and, subsequently, passed through different columns to separately desorb CO2 and H2O, which were quantified by TCD."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The experimental installation to accomplish the glycerol steam reforming test was a MICROACTIVITY-PRO unit (PID Eng&Tech. S.L.), which consists of a fixed-bed tubular reactor in stainless steel 316 (i.d. =9.2mm, L =300mm) located inside an electric oven of low thermal inertia, where temperature inside the catalytic bed is measured by means of a thermocouple. All the components are placed inside a hot box in stainless steel 316 with a convector of hot air at 200°C to prevent the condensation of volatile products in the pipes and to preheat the reactants efficiently. The liquid reaction mixture (glycerol and water) is fed by means of a GILSON 307 piston pump (0.01–5mL/min, 400bar) and it pass through an evaporator before mixing with the preheated carrier gas (N2) and entering the reactor. At the reactor outlet, there is a thermoelectric unit to condense and separate condensable vapours. Gaseous products flowing away the reactor are analyzed online using a Varian CP-3380 gas chromatograph equipped with a sampling valve (250μL, with heating oven), two columns (Hayesep Q 6m and Molecular sieve 13X 1m) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), where helium was used as both the carrier gas and the reference gas. Condensable compounds are trapped in the condenser are analyzed on a Varian CP-3900 gas chromatograph equipped with a CP-WAX 52 CB (30m×0.25mm, DF=0.25) column and flame ionization detector (FID). The catalyst (0.1g; particle size: 0.15–0.25mm) was placed in the reactor (catalytic bed: 0.5cm3) and, previous to the reaction, it was in situ reduced under flowing pure hydrogen (30mL/min) at 600°C for 4.5h with a heating rate of 2°C/min. Then, catalytic test was carried out isothermally at 600°C and atmospheric pressure. A liquid mixture with water/glycerol molar ratio of 6 was introduced at a flow rate of 0.075mL/min, vaporized at 200°C and further eluted by N2 (60mL/min). The total gas hourly space velocity (GHSV=22,500h−1) was defined as the ratio between volumetric flow rate of the total gaseous feed stream (water+glycerol+nitrogen) at normal conditions and the volume of catalyst, while the glycerol weight hourly space velocity (WHSVglycerol =23.2h−1) was defined as the ratio between the mass flow rate of glycerol fed and the mass of catalyst. Space velocity and steam-to-carbon ratio used in this work are higher than typical values found in literature [9,10,32] in order to highlight differences in activity between catalysts and deactivation effects at relatively short time (time-on-stream (TOS)=5h). From the mass flow rates (m i ) and the composition of the output gas and liquid (condensable vapours) streams, the glycerol conversion and yield to gases were calculated as follows: X glycerol ( % ) = m glycerol,in − m glycerol,out m glycerol,in × 100 Y gases ( wt % ) = m gases,out m feed,in − m excess water,in × 100 where m gases,out is the mass flow rate of the gaseous (non-condensable) products stream at the reactor outlet (mass flow rate of the inert carrier gas subtracted), m feed,in is the mass flow rate of the liquid mixture water/glycerol fed to the reactor and m excess water,in is the mass flow rate corresponding to the excess of water fed to the reactor according to the stoichiometry defined in Eq. (1), i.e. 3mol of excess water per mol of glycerol. The amount of coke deposited during reaction was evaluated by thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) as described in Section 2.2."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Supports characterization,"3.1 Supports characterization Fig. 1a shows the low-angle XRD patterns of calcined supports. An intense main diffraction peak and two weak peaks can be observed for all the samples, corresponding to the (100), (110), (200) planes, characteristics of the hexagonal pore mesostructure of SBA-15 material. Although peaks intensity slightly decreases with the incorporation of Ca or Mg, whose content in the corresponding support measured by ICP-AES was 5.8 and 6.7wt%, respectively, the porous structure is well preserved. High-angle XRD patterns are not shown, since no peak corresponding to neither Mg nor Ca species can be observed even though magnesium or calcium oxides are expected to be formed due to calcination of the samples at 600°C. This is indicative of high dispersion of these oxides over the support. Fig. 1b shows the N2-physisorption results of these supports. Type IV isotherms with a hysteresis loop, typical of mesoporous materials, can be observed for all the samples (Fig. 1b.i), indicating again preservation of the porous structure upon promoters addition. However, the nitrogen adsorbed volume is lower when Mg and, mainly, Ca are added to the SBA-15, which suggests some loss of porosity due to promoters incorporation. Moreover, supports present narrow pore size distribution around 8.7nm (Fig. 1b.ii), typical of SBA-15 materials. Nevertheless, it is slightly wider for the Ca-modified support, which may be related to higher porous structure distortion by incorporating calcium onto the SBA-15. Textural properties values are shown in Table 1 . Comparing the bare SBA-15 with the modified supports, significant reduction on the surface area and pore volume can be observed after the incorporation of promoters, especially with Ca, while small variation can be notice on pore diameters. As detected by XRD of the supports and as later commented in Section 3.2, Mg and Ca phases are deposited on the SBA-15 in the form of a finely dispersed layer, which will probably cover the entrance/exit of some pores and, as a consequence, decrease the S BET and the pore volume of the material, while the mean size of the uncovered pores remains almost constant (just decreasing as a consequence of the layer of Mg or Ca deposited on the internal surface of the pores)."
7,Catalysts characterization,"3.2 Catalysts characterization Table 1 summarizes the physicochemical properties of the calcined catalysts. Nickel contents measured by ICP-AES were checked to be close to the nominal loadings (6.8wt% in the calcined catalysts). Regarding textural properties, the incorporation of Ni leaded to lower surface area and, mainly, lower pore volume and mean pore diameter in comparison to the corresponding support. This may indicate some blocking of the support porosity after incorporation of the metal. Comparing catalysts, the same trend observed for supports can be found, so that textural properties values decrease in the order: Ni/SBA-15>Ni/Mg/SBA-15>Ni/Ca/SBA-15. The mean diameter of the nickel phase crystallites calculated from XRD are also shown in Table 1 both for the calcined and the reduced samples, and the corresponding diffractograms are displayed in Fig. 2 . XRD patterns of the calcined catalysts (Fig. 2a) exhibit peaks at 2θ =37.3°, 43.3° and 62.9°, corresponding to the planes (111), (200) and (220) of cubic NiO (JCPDS 78-0643), respectively. These peaks disappear in the XRD diffractograms of the reduced samples, where peaks at 2θ =44.5° and 51.8° can be observed, corresponding to the planes (111) and (200) of cubic Ni (JCPDS 04-0850), respectively. This verifies the complete reduction of NiO to Ni0 during the activation process. As in the case of the modified supports, no peak corresponding to any Mg or Ca species are observed in promoted catalysts, which indicates that high dispersion of these species over the support is kept after the incorporation of the Ni phase and the corresponding calcination and reduction processes. Besides, peaks become wider and less intense for the promoted samples, mainly for the Ni/Ca/SBA-15 catalyst, which is indicative of the formation of smaller crystallites of the Ni phase by Mg and Ca incorporation onto the support. This dispersing effect of Mg and Ca on the Ni phase was corroborated by the mean crystallites sizes calculated from the line broadening of the NiO(200) and the Ni(100) diffractions using the Scherrer equation (see Table 1). For both calcined and reduced samples, the mean diameter of these crystallites diminishes in the order: Ni/SBA-15>Ni/Mg/SBA-15>Ni/Ca/SBA-15. Crystallites in the reduced catalysts were found to be smaller than those in the calcined samples due to lattice contraction from NiO to Ni0 due to different molar volume of these phases. However, the final size also depends on the thermal stability of the catalyst during the reduction process. Differences in the Ni phase particles size were confirmed by means of TEM. Micrographs of the calcined catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . The pore mesostructure with hexagonal arrangement of the SBA-15 material used as the support could be observed for all the samples, together with dark particles corresponding to NiO deposited on it. While these particles are clearly seen on the Ni/SBA-15 sample (Fig. 3a) with diameters ranging from 12 to 25nm, they can be hardly noticed on the Ni/Ca/SBA-15 (Fig. 3c), where just at high magnification small particles with diameters from 4 to 8nm can be discerned. Fig. 3b shows an intermediate situation for the Ni/Mg/SBA-15, where both some large particles of 18–25nm and many small particles of 4–9nm diameters are found. The mean NiO particles diameter obtained from direct measurements on the images (minimum of 50 metallic particles on a minimum of 3 different zones of the sample dispersed on the grid) is given in Table 1 and it correlates fairly well with the size calculated from XRD. Thus, this confirms that high dispersion of the Ni phase was achieved by incorporating Mg and, mainly, Ca to the SBA-15 support. This also accounts for the metallic particles distribution found on Ni/SBA-15 and Ni/Mg/SBA-15 samples, since the mean particle size of the Ni phase is higher than the pore diameter of the SBA-15 material (Table 1). As a consequence, TEM micrographs of Ni/SBA-15 sample only show NiO particles outside the support pores, while a bimodal distribution of metallic particles is found in the Ni/Mg/SBA-15 catalyst. On the other hand, promoters cannot be observed in TEM images, since they were finely dispersed on the SBA-15 support, as demonstrated by EDX analyses (not shown) performed on areas of the support free of visible particles. Finally, Fig. 4 shows the TPR profiles of the calcined catalysts. Two reduction zones can be observed: (i) the area below 400°C (∼265–400°C), corresponding to the reduction of NiO particles with low metal-support interaction (under our experimental conditions, pure NiO reduced between 230 and 350°C with maximum around 300°C); (ii) the region above 400°C, assigned to the reduction of the part of Ni phase strongly interacting with the support. The total area under the profiles is almost the same for all the samples, indicating similar reducibility, which resulted to be ∼100%. However, it can be clearly observed how the area under the low-temperature zone decreases in the order Ni/SBA-15>Ni/Mg/SBA-15>Ni/Ca/SBA-15, whereas the area under the high-temperature region increases in the same order, as well as the temperature at which maximum reduction takes place shifts towards higher values. This suggests strengthening of the interaction between the Ni phase and the support by the incorporation of Mg and especially Ca into the catalyst and may account for the smaller crystallites of the nickel phase found in the promoted samples (see Table 1) due to higher stability of the metal phase."
8,Catalytic tests on glycerol steam reforming,"3.3 Catalytic tests on glycerol steam reforming The catalytic results in glycerol steam reforming are summarized in Table 2 in terms of glycerol conversion, as well as the yield and composition of the gaseous products stream. Condensable products were also formed during the reaction and collected in the liquid phase. Analysis by GC confirmed that this stream was an aqueous solution containing non-converted glycerol and intermediate products, such as acrolein, propyleneglycol, hydroxyacetone, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and ethanol, in concentrations lower than 1wt%, except for the hydroxyacetone which varied between 1.5 and 3.5wt%, the highest value corresponding to the Ni/Ca/SBA-15 catalyst. All the catalysts reached glycerol conversions above 89% after stabilization at 1h TOS, mainly leading to gaseous products with yields to gases above 64wt%. Both conversion and gas yield were higher for the promoted samples, as a consequence of higher Ni dispersion by Mg and Ca incorporation to the catalyst. On the other hand, after 5h on stream, conversion significantly decreased for the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst together with gases production, indicating deactivation of this sample. However, both Ni/Mg/SBA-15 and Ni/Ca/SBA-15 catalysts were able to maintain conversion values above 95%, which may be ascribed to higher thermal stability of Ni due to stronger metal-support interaction. Regarding the gaseous products distribution, it was almost constant with time for all the samples, with hydrogen contents higher than 50%. The rest of the products in the gas stream were only carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane. Although hydrogen content in the gas stream is similar for all the catalysts, it increased in the order Ni/SBA-15<Ni/Ca/SBA-15<Ni/Mg/SBA-15, and the same trend was found for the carbon dioxide content, indicating higher contribution of reforming reactions and water-gas shift leading to hydrogen formation in the case of the promoted samples, probably as a result of higher Ni dispersion. In this regard, methane percentage found among the gases was below 2mol%, but contrary to expected, it was higher for the promoted samples. This may be due to improved methane formation from intermediates (this accounts for the higher yield to gaseous products), which cannot be completely converted into hydrogen. The amount of coke formed during the reaction has been also included in Table 2 as determined by TGA and elemental analysis. The values obtained by both techniques are similar, since the molar H/C ratio measured in the elemental analyzer was only 0.03–0.04 (the highest ratio corresponding to Ni/Ca/SBA-15 sample). The greatest coke deposition was found for the Ni/SBA-15 sample. It is known that support basicity due to alkaline elements addition and smaller Ni particles, as found on the Mg- and Ca-modified samples, negatively affects the mechanism of carbon nanofibres formation, typically found on this kind of catalysts [12,29,30,33]. However, just slight decrease of coke formation was observed for the Mg-promoted catalyst. This must be a consequence of the high glycerol conversion maintained along the 5h on stream [29]. In the case of the Ca-promoted catalyst, despite the high glycerol conversion, due to the higher basicity of CaO in comparison to MgO, it leaded to the lowest amount of coke with a reduction around 25% with respect to the Ni/SBA-15 sample, which corroborates significant effect on the carbon resistance by Ca incorporation to the catalyst. To summarize, decreasing activity with time was measured for the unpromoted sample, which mainly yielded to liquid and solid products. However, both Mg and Ca addition to the catalyst leaded to conversions above 95mol%, which kept constant with time, and significantly higher hydrogen production."
9,Used catalysts characterization,"3.4 Used catalysts characterization In order to determine the causes for the different activity behaviour along time between the Ni/SBA-15 and the promoted samples, catalysts used in glycerol steam reforming for 5h were characterized. Main deactivation causes ascribed to nickel catalysts used in reforming processes are the loss of active surface by metal sintering and coke deposition [11–13]. The XRD patterns of the used samples are displayed in Fig. 5 . Peaks corresponding to the planes (002) and (100) of graphitic carbon can be observed at ca. 26° and 43.7° (JCPDS 41-1487), due to coke deposition. The peaks corresponding to the planes (111) and (200) of cubic Ni are also exhibited at 2θ =44.5° and 51.8° (JCPDS 04-0850), although the main peak of Ni overlapped with that of graphite at 43.7°. Curve-fitting of these overlapped peaks was performed to determine the Ni(111) line width in order to calculate the mean crystallites sizes, which are summarized in Table 3 . From these values, only slight metal sintering can be inferred for all the samples. However, this cannot account for the significant activity loss suffered by the Ni/SBA-15 sample while promoted samples were stable. So, differences in the structure of the coke deposits were studied trying to search a correlation with catalytic activity. From the position and width of the (002) diffraction peak of the graphite-like material, the interlayer distance (d 002) and the average crystal domain size along the direction perpendicular to the basal planes (L c) of the graphitic-type structure could be calculated, respectively. These parameters are recorded in Table 3. The d 002 value of graphite is considered to be 3.38Å (JCPDS 41-1487) and higher values imply lower graphitization degree, as lower values of L c do. Interlayer spacings in the range 3.44–3.48Å have been calculated, suggesting highly defective carbon deposits. On the other hand, L c values decreased in the order Ni/SBA-15>Ni/Mg/SBA-15>Ni/Ca/SBA-15, opposite to the variation of the d 002 value, which should be related to higher disordered nature of the deposited carbon on the promoted samples. It is known that under steam reforming conditions, the involvement of H2O in the reaction helps to remove some coke via gasification, which progresses at structural defects, such as vacancies, face edges and others [34]. So, TG analyses can be employed as a complementary technique for evaluation of the structural order of coke deposits, since the more ordered the carbon structure, the higher will be the temperature for gasification [35,36] during temperature-programmed experiments, such as TGA. Fig. 6 displays the derivative thermograms, where it can be observed that oxidation of carbon deposits took place from 450 to 625°C, although temperature corresponding to maximum gasification rate (T max) ranged between 555 and 566°C depending on the catalyst (Table 3). As a reference, amorphous carbon oxidizes below 550°C, while graphitic/filamentous carbon does at higher temperature [37,38]. The shape of the TGA profiles with overlapped peaks indicates two types of carbonaceous species with similar reactivity, according to the narrow T max values range, which may be ascribed to a similar kind of graphitic material with different ordering degree. In general, T max decreased in the order Ni/SBA-15>Ni/Mg/SBA-15>Ni/Ca/SBA-15, indicating that more defective carbon structures have being formed on the promoted catalysts. The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts must be the result of the formation rate minus the gasification rate, which accounts for the lower coke amount found on the promoted catalysts. In addition, it has being stated that Mg and Ca incorporation to Ni catalysts can enhance the steam gasification of coke by activating H2O adsorption [30,38]. However, carbon deposition on the Ni/Mg/SBA-15 was just slightly lower than that on Ni/SBA-15, while significant deactivation was only observed for the latter. This suggests that in the presence of the promoters the formed coke did not block the nickel surface for the reaction [29]. So, in an attempt to clarify the interaction between the Ni particles and the coke deposits in the different samples, TEM images of the used catalysts were taken, as shown in Fig. 7 . As in the case of the fresh catalysts, the pore arrangement of the SBA-15 support, which has been well preserved even under reaction conditions, can be clearly observed for all the samples. Metallic Ni particles can be also discerned as round dark particles. Besides, coke deposits with the morphology of carbon nanofibres were found among the catalyst particles, predominating on the Ni/SBA-15 and Ni/Mg/SBA-15 samples, as measured by TGA. Regarding the size of the Ni particles, following the trend observed for the calcined catalyst, they were larger on the Ni/SBA-15 sample (Fig. 7a), with diameters between 9 and 26nm, and smaller for the promoted samples with sizes ranging from 5 to 16nm for Ni/Mg/SBA-15 (Fig. 7b) and from 4 to 8 for Ni/Ca/SBA-15 (Fig. 7c). The mean Ni particles diameter directly measured on the micrographs is shown in Table 3, showing the same trend as calculated by XRD, thus confirming slight metal sintering during glycerol steam reforming. Concerning carbon deposits, some differences in morphology can be found depending on the catalyst. High magnification of the images shows that carbon deposits are a mixture of solid herringbone fibres and multi-walled nanotubes (hollow fibres). Although a Ni particle can be found at the tip of some fibres, which has been carried away from the support surface, most of the tips are absent of Ni. This may indicate that both a tip-growth and a base-growth of the nanofibres took place, as reported for other kind of Ni catalysts [39]. However, higher number of Ni particles at the tip of the fibre can be observed for the Ni/SBA-15 sample in comparison to the promoted catalysts. Examination of these Ni particles shows that most of them are encapsulated with a layer of carbon. According to literature [40,41], tip-growth of filaments ceases when carbon is formed at a rate higher than bulk diffusion and surface migration, causing an excess of carbon to deposit as encapsulating carbon, which ultimately deactivates the catalyst. On the contrary, during the base-growth of filaments, a free metal surface continues to be available for the reactants, thus catalyst resulting more stable [40,42]. The reason why less carbon fibres with Ni at tip were found in the case of the promoted samples should be the smaller Ni particles and the stronger Ni-support interaction (as determined by XRD, TEM and TPR), which impede carbon nucleation in this kind of filaments and favours the base-growth pathway [39,43,44]. Consequently, higher amount of graphite-covered Ni particles formed on the Ni/SBA-15 sample than on the Mg- and Ca-promoted catalysts. In addition, some Ni particles attached to the support where also found to be encapsulated by graphitic layers (onion-like carbon deposits) on the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst. All this may account for the higher graphitization degree observed by XRD and the higher coke gasification temperature measured by TGA for this sample (Table 3). Thus, deactivation of the Ni/SBA-15 sample observed during the glycerol steam reforming (see Table 2) may be ascribed to the formation of these kind of encapsulating carbon structures, which were seldom found on the Ni/Mg/SBA-15 and Ni/Ca/SBA-15 catalyst. Moreover, since Ni particles in the Ni/SBA-15 sample are bigger, it has lower number of active Ni sites available, so that it is more prone to deactivation as coke is deposited on these sites."
10,Conclusions,"The catalytic performance and stability of Ni/SBA-15 catalyst in glycerol steam reforming can be significantly improved by Mg or Ca addition to the SBA-15 support. Promoting effects of the incorporation of Mg or Ca are the decrease of the Ni phase crystallites size and the strengthening of the Ni-support interaction, being more noticeable in the case of Ca addition. As a consequence, higher glycerol conversion and hydrogen production, which kept constant with time, were reached with promoted samples. Besides, coke resistance was also enhanced as a result of the formation of highly structural defective carbon deposits, easier to be gasified under steam reforming conditions, mainly in the form of non-encapsulating carbon nanofibres and multi-walled nanotubes. On the other hand, non-promoted Ni/SBA-15 catalyst leaded to carbon deposits with higher graphitization degree where relatively high proportion of Ni particles were found to be encapsulated by graphitic layers, accounting for deactivation during the glycerol steam reforming. Different structure of coke deposited on the samples is also ascribed to different Ni particles size and Ni-support interaction. Thus, the Ni/Ca/SBA-15 catalyst achieved the highest glycerol conversion (98.4%) and yield to gases formation (69.9wt%) with a content of 53vol% of hydrogen, as well as the lowest coke deposition."
