0,Introduction,"The thermochemical hydrolysis cycle is considered as one of the most important methods for large-scale hydrogen production. Among large-scale, cost effective and environmentally attractive hydrogen production processes, the sulfur–iodine (SI or IS) thermochemical cycle appears to be quite promising. The cycle consists of the following three reactions: I2 (l) + SO2 (g) + 2H2O (l) = 2HI (aq.) + H2SO4 (aq.) (a) 2HI (g) = I2 (g) + H2 (g) (b) H2SO4 (g) = SO2 (g) + H2O (g) + 0.5O2 (g) (c) The Bunsen reaction (a), which produces hydrogen iodide (HI) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), is an SO2 gas-absorbing reaction in aqueous phase. The two acids separate into light and heavy phases with a clear boundary in the presence of an excess of I2. The separated HI solution dissolves the excess I2 and is denoted as the HIx phase. After purification, HI is separated from I2 by distillation, and then decomposed to produce H2 and I2. Similarly, the separated H2SO4 solution, denoted as the H2SO4 phase, is purified, concentrated, vaporized and decomposed to produce O2, H2O and SO2. I2, H2O and SO2 are then recycled back to the Bunsen reaction (a). Therefore, the net equation of the entire cycle is the splitting of water into H2 and O2. Reaction (b), HI decomposition, is one of the most significant reactions, not only in this cycle, but also in other thermochemical hydrolysis cycles using iodine [1]. Substantial work on the hydrogen iodide (HI) decomposition reaction for hydrogen production has been performed, including experimental and computational evaluation of important factors such as the conversion ratio and the kinetics of homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. It is advantageous to carry out the reaction at relatively low temperature, with respect to both limitations of the construction materials and thermal efficiency. However, the rate of the homogeneous reaction is low at temperatures below 700 K. Thus, it is important to use a catalyst to accelerate the reaction rate. Investigations into catalytic HI decomposition are found from the late 1970’s and early 1980’s [1–4], for a thorough summary see O’keefe et al. [1]. It was reported that platinum supported on alumina, activated carbon and ceria show high catalytic activity [4–10]; but, results showed that the activity of these materials was just slightly better than original activated carbon above 723 K. For large-scale hydrogen production, the economic cost of activated carbon is much more attractive than the mentioned precious-metal catalysts. However, information on activated carbon for HI decomposition, such as catalytic activity, influence of raw materials, activation method and physicochemical properties [11] etc, are rarely found in literature. The main purpose of this work was to find the best carbon activation method for activated carbon catalyzed hydrogen iodide decomposition; and, to explore the relationship between catalytic activity and physicochemical properties through activity evaluation and catalyst characterization."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Three kinds of wood-based activated carbons were prepared by different activation methods. The activated carbon substrates used are commercially available, and kindly donated by Shanghai Activated Carbon Co., Ltd. The activated carbon substrates were crushed into powder before use. The grain size distribution of the powder was 100–200 mesh, 45 wt.%; 200–400 mesh, 50 wt.%; >400 mesh, 5 wt.%. Wood-based activated carbon produced by steam activation was marked as SJ1. Wood-based activated carbon produced by ZnCl2 activation was marked as SJ2. Wood-based activated carbon produced by H3PO4 activation was marked as SJ3."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 XRD X-ray diffraction (XRD) of samples were obtained using a Rigaku D/MAX 2550/PC X-ray powder diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation was employed and the working voltage and current were 40 kV and 100 mA, respectively. The X-ray powder diffractogram was recorded at 0.02° intervals in the range 10° ≤ 2θ ≤ 80°. 2.2.2 Pore structure N2 adsorption isotherms, surface areas, pore volumes and pore size distribution curves for the samples were measured at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 using static adsorption procedure. A sample size of approximately 100 mg was used for each analysis and was degassed at 523 K for at least 5 h, until a pressure of 10−5 Pa was attained. The BET surface area (BET) was calculated from N2 adsorption data at relative pressures 0.05 < P/P 0 < 0.3. The total pore volume (TPV) was calculated from the amount of N2 adsorbed at P/P 0 = 0.99. The density functional theory (DFT) model was used to analyze the results. 2.2.3 Surface morphology The morphology of the samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) performed on an Hitachi S-4800 operated at 5 kV–20 kV. Samples were mounted on aluminum stubs using double-sided tape. The image was obtained in secondary electron mode, in conjunction with SEM imaging. 2.2.4 Proximate analysis and elemental analysis Proximate analysis was carried out on a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA/SDTA851). Elemental analysis of carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, nitrogen was obtained from a LECO CHNS-932 Elemental Analyzer. 2.2.5 Boehm’s titration Fresh activated carbon samples were converted into fine powders and dried in an oven for 3 h at 383 K. Approximately 200 mg of the dried material was dispersed in 10 mL of each of the following standard solutions: 0.1 mol/L NaOH, 0.05 mol/L Na2CO3, 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3. The dispersions were oscillated for 12 h in conical flasks and then allowed to settle for 24 h. The solutions were filtered and washed several times, all the filtrate was gathered in filter flasks. Each of the solutions was then mixed with 20 mL 0.1 mol/L HCL standard solution, and back-titrated with 0.1 mol/L NaOH standard solution in the presence of a few drops of phenolphthalein indicator. In the cases of Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 titrations, the CO2 produced was removed by gently boiling for 5 min and the solution was cooled down to room temperature before titration. Sodium hydroxide is assumed to neutralize carboxylic, lactonic, and phenolic groups; sodium carbonate neutralizes carboxylic and lactonic groups; sodium bicarbonate neutralizes only carboxylic groups. 2.2.6 Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD-MS) The surface oxygen-containing groups of the supports were characterized by temperature-programmed desorption and mass spectrometry (TPD-MS) methods, which were carried out using an apparatus consisting of a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 and a Hiden QIC20. Sample masses of 0.1 g were loaded into a quartz U-tube with an inner diameter of 10.0 mm. Prior to desorption experiments, the samples were degassed for 1 h in helium stream (50 cm3(STP)/min) at 383 K. Then the temperature was increased to 1373 K at heating rate of 10 K/min in helium stream (50 cm3(STP)/min). The evolution of carbon dioxide (m/z = 44) and of carbon monoxide (m/z = 28) was monitored by the Hiden QIC20 quadrupole mass spectrometer. The desorption profiles of CO and CO2 are characteristic of specific surface groups (carboxylic acid, lactone, phenol, etc.) 2.2.7 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) The XPS measurements were carried out in the UHV chamber of an ESCALAB-MKII (VG Scientific) electron spectrometer equipped with Al Kα source (hν = 1486.6 eV). The base pressure of the system was 2 × 10−8 Pa, and the measurements were carried out at 2 × 10−7–1 × 10−6 Pa. For each catalyst, a survey spectrum was collected before high-resolution spectra were recorded. All spectra were calibrated by the C1s of carbon at 284.6 eV as a reference line. For the analysis of the peaks, a Shirley type background was used. Peaks were adjusted to a combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions using the XPSPeak 4.0 software. Relative intensity of the surface species was equal to the corresponding deconvoluted peak areas."
4,Activity evaluation,"2.3 Activity evaluation A schematic diagram of the apparatus used in the experiment is shown in Fig. 1 . The catalytic experiments were performed in a fixed-bed reactor at 573–823 K. The reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a quartz reaction tube with inner diameter of 18 mm. A 1 g mass of the catalyst was mixed uniformly with an appropriate volume of coarse quartz particles, and then fixed in the tube with quartz wool. A BT00-100J peristaltic pump supplied hydriodic acid (55 wt.%) at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min, which, after vaporizing in an evaporator, was carried into the quartz reaction tube by nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 60 mL/min. The majority of HI, I2, and H2O produced were trapped in a spiral condenser, with any residual HI, I2 and H2O being absorbed by another twin downstream scrubbers. The purified hydrogen and nitrogen gas were analyzed by an online hydrogen analyzer (K522, thermal conductivity method)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst analysis,"3.1 Catalyst analysis 3.1.1 XRD measurement The results of XRD measurement (Fig. 2 ) confirmed that samples under analysis are characterized by a significant content of an amorphous phase in the structure of a carbon matrix. The two broad peaks indicate that content of well ordered crystalline phase can be neglected. The peak from 2θ = 20° to 2θ = 30° range corresponds to reflexes in plane (002), while the peak from 40° to 48° range correspond to plane (100). These features most probably result from the graphite layers spaced in a distance of d(002) = 0.34 nm in plane (002) and d(100) = 0.21 nm in plane (100). Peaks arising from impurities in the sample decreased across the sample range, from sample SJ1 to SJ3, predicting the decline of ash from SJ1 to SJ3. This is supported by the results of proximate analysis as shown in Table 1 . 3.1.2 Nitrogen physisorption Nitrogen physisorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 3 . These isotherms were type IV isotherms according to the IUPAC classification. An infinite slope at low-relative pressure was found, the extent of adsorption at low-relative pressure already reveals information about the degree of micro-porosity. On the other hand, at high relative pressures, all curves exhibited H2 type hysteresis loops, which could be attributed to the presence of mesopores in the structure. The specific surface area and pore volume of samples are given in Table 2 . The BET surface area of SJ3 was 1675 m2/g, bigger than SJ2 (1453 m2/g), and twice as big as SJ1 (808 m2/g). The pore volume of SJ3 was 1.2939 cm3/g, similar to SJ2 (1.3293 cm3/g), but much bigger than SJ1 (0.5479 cm3/g). The pore size distributions of samples are given in Fig. 4 . It’s clearly that the size distribution for SJ3 is similar to SJ2, with both showing a greater volume of pores for a given pore diameter than SJ1; therefore, SJ3 and SJ2 have many more mesopores than SJ1. 3.1.3 SEM results Fig. 5 shows the SEM images of (a) SJ1, (b) SJ2 and (c) SJ3 samples. The pore structure of each sample is in accord with the pore structure model for activated carbon; but, the samples’ surface morphologies are quite different. Surface macropores of SJ2 and SJ3 were much bigger than SJ1, with more pores in the macropores size domain, suggesting a more developed honeycomb porous structure in the sub-surface. Surface morphology of SJ3 was rough as it is to some extent eroded by H3PO4. 3.1.4 Proximate and elemental analysis As shown in Table 1, proximate and elemental analysis of samples was carried out on air dry basis. According to proximate analysis, the ash content of SJ1 is much higher than SJ2 and SJ3; the volatile matter of SJ2 was slightly higher than SJ3, but three times higher than SJ1. The data from the elemental analysis show that the weight content of carbon in SJ3 is 5.5% higher than SJ2 and 14.6% higher than SJ1. All the samples had lower nitrogen and sulfur content less than 0.6%. 3.1.5 Boehm titration The results of Boehm titration, presented in Fig. 6 , suggest that all samples contain acid (i.e. carboxylic, lactonic and phenolic groups). The order of total acid group content is SJ2 > SJ3 > SJ1. A greater total acid contents, indicates a higher oxygen content, which is supported by the results of elemental analysis shown in Table 1. 3.1.6 TPD-MS Since chemical titration methods failed to account for a large proportion of the total oxygen content of carbon materials [12], they should be used in combination with other techniques. Accordingly, the samples were further characterized by TPD-MS method, monitoring release of CO and CO2 along with the heating process. Although there is some controversy in the literature [13] concerning the assignment of TPD peaks to specific surface groups, some general conclusions have been drawn: A low temperature CO2 peak is assigned to carboxylic acid groups, while a high temperature CO2 peak is assigned to lactones. Carboxylic anhydrides give rise to both a CO peak and a CO2 peak; phenols, ethers, carbonyls and quinones produce just one CO peak. The CO2 desorption profiles shown in Fig. 7 a illustrated the three different peaks. The low temperature peak, centered around 523 K, is ascribed to free carboxylic groups. Both CO2 and CO profiles exhibit a peak centered around 750 K with the same area and half width, which is attributed to the decomposition of carboxylic anhydrides. The third CO2 desorption peak, centered around 820 K, and is assigned to lactones. The relative quantity of carboxylic acid groups and lactone groups is SJ2 > SJ3 > SJ1, from the integration of each peak area. The feature centered around 1090 K may be assigned to the decomposition of calcium carbonate (decomposed at about 1098 K) in ash. The CO desorption shown in Fig. 7b can be decomposed into three sets of peaks. The first peak centered around 750 K is assigned to carboxylic anhydrides. As expected, a peak with the same maximum temperature appears in the CO2 desorption profiles. The peak centered at temperatures ranging from 900 to 950 K is assigned to phenols. The set of peaks at temperatures above 1150 K is assigned to carbonyls, quinones and ethers. Table 3 shows the amounts of CO and CO2 released, obtained by integration of the areas under the TPD peaks. Assuming that the acid groups were homogeneously distributed on the surface, the amounts of CO and CO2 released were re-evaluated using the BET values to give the density of oxygen per unit surface area (defined as [O]). 3.1.7 XPS results The high-resolution C1s XPS spectra of samples (Table 4 ) are shown in Fig. 8 . There are five individual component peaks: graphitic carbon (peak I, BE = 284.6 eV), carbon present in phenol, alcohol, or ether groups (peak II, BE = 286.2 eV), carbonyl or quinone groups (peak III, BE = 287.5 eV), carboxylic acid or ester groups (peak IV, BE = 289.3 eV) and p–p∗ transitions in aromatic systems (peak V, BE = 291.2 eV) [14]."
7,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance Temperature dependent catalytic activity, based on HI conversion is shown in Fig. 9 . Thermodynamic yield A was obtained from O’Keefe’s work [1]. The two lines for A come from different evaluation methods. Thermodynamic yield B is the result calculated in this work using FactSage, a commercial software package for thermodynamic calculations. The catalytic activity of the blank was insignificant, while the performance of activated carbons was considerably improved at the same temperature. Activated carbon catalyst SJ3 shows the highest catalytic activity, followed by SJ2, with SJ1 showing the least activity of catalysts investigated."
8,Mechanism discussion,"3.3 Mechanism discussion For all temperatures that showed significant HI conversion, an increase in activity correlated with an increase in carbon content (Cad) of sample and a consequent decrease in ash content (Aad). This behavior would tend to suggest that carbon-containing compounds or carbon itself is beneficial to catalytic activity, while the inorganic ash material has little or no effect in catalytic activity. The trend for BET surface area was SJ3 > SJ2 > SJ1, which is the same as the trend for catalytic activity, suggesting that a high BET surface area is beneficial to catalytic activity. Further observation on pore structure showed a more important phenomenon: mesopores in SJ3 and SJ2 are more abundant than in SJ1. More mesopores would favor reaction diffusion, which is significant in catalytic processes. The effect of surface acidic groups, as measured by Boehm titrations, on catalyst activity was also analyzed. No obvious correlation can be found between any particular type of acid group (i.e., carboxylic, lactonic, or phenolic) and catalyst activity. Every type of surface acidic group is in greater abundance in SJ2 than in SJ3, but the catalytic activity is just the contrary. As each of the samples may have produced different types of surface oxygen-containing groups, Boehm’s titrations consider only three types of surface acidic groups, lumping together different groups titratable by a given reagent. It is, therefore, likely that this assay failed to account for a large proportion of the total oxygen content of carbon materials. In an attempt to explore a more detailed knowledge (than that provided by the Boehm’s titrations) of the oxygen-containing groups that may play a significant role in catalyst activity, Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD-MS) analyses were performed. Bear in mind, that the area density and the total amounts of CO and CO2 released from SJ2 were greater than for SJ3, but the catalyst activity decreased. In order to find the valence state and existence form of surface carbon, to further understanding of the catalyst function, XPS analyses was performed. From the result of XPS analyses, the prevalence of oxygen-containing groups in SJ2 is greater than SJ3, which correlates to the TPD-MS analyses. The results of TPD-MS analyses and XPS analyses lead to the conclusion that surface oxygen-containing groups are not directly responsible for catalytic activity. The composition of activated carbon is essentially water, inorganic ash material, trace elements (such as nitrogen, sulfur and hydrogen), oxygen (mainly in oxygen-containing groups) and carbon. Water and inorganic ash material do not demonstrate catalytic activity, trace elements are too few to mention, and oxygen-containing groups are not directly responsible for catalytic activity. Therefore, carbon compounds became the most likely catalytically active constituent. Traditional practice, supported by research, has held that the catalytic activity of many metals and metallic oxides depends on the active site, most of which are lattice defects. An example is CeO2, which was used as a catalyst for HI decomposition [15]. As a lot of unsaturated carbon atoms (unpaired electron and lone pair electron of carbon atoms) are found in the microcrystalline structure of activated carbon (especially on the edge and surface), these unsaturated carbon atoms posses a similar structure to a lattice defect. Also, the graphite layer in activated carbon provides π electrons, which also have catalytic activity. From the foregoing, we make a hypothesis that unsaturated carbon atoms maybe the main active constituent. Although unsaturated carbon atoms are hard to rationalize through above characterization methods, it is clear that the lower the oxygen content, the greater the occurrence of unsaturated carbon atoms, as unsaturated carbon atoms tend to integrate oxygen atoms to reach state of saturation. If the pore structures and area densities of oxygen [O] can be considered as the main factors of catalytic activity, the relationship between physicochemical properties and catalytic activities will become clear. The area density of oxygen [O] released from SJ2 was similar to SJ1, the surface area and pore diameter of SJ2 were larger than SJ1, so the catalytic activity of SJ2 is higher than SJ1. The surface area and pore diameter of SJ3 were similar to SJ2, the area density of oxygen [O] released of SJ3 was smaller than SJ2, so the catalytic activity of SJ3 is higher than SJ2."
9,Conclusions,"In this study, wood-based activated carbon catalysts, produced via different activation methods, have been tested to evaluate their catalytic activity for decomposition of hydrogen iodide in the range of 573–823 K. The wood-based activated carbon catalysts strongly improved HI conversion, especially for the activated carbon produced by H3PO4. This result suggested that different preparation methods may have played a significant role in the development of physicochemical properties of activated carbon that eventually dictated catalyst activity. Various characterization methods such as proximate analysis and ultimate analysis, XRD, BET, SEM, Boehm titration, TPD-MS, XPS were employed. High carbon content (Cad) seems to favor high catalytic activity while high ash content (Aad) was detrimental to catalytic activity. Oxygen-containing groups were not directly responsible for catalytic activity. HI conversion increased as the surface area and pore diameter increased. Unsaturated carbon atoms may be the main active constituent. Therefore, low area density of oxygen [O] which was closely related to unsaturated carbon atoms was beneficial to HI conversion."
