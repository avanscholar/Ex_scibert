0,Introduction,"In recent years, the limited availability of fossil fuels and the increasing environmental pollution derived from their use as main source of energy has led to the development of new technologies for the production of zero environmental impact energy vectors such as hydrogen [1]. Hydrogen is a storable, clean and environmentally friendly fuel whose combustion results in the solely generation of water, with no emissions of atmospheric pollutants, greenhouse gases or particulates. However, about 95% of hydrogen currently derives from fossil fuels, mainly by steam reforming of natural gas and petroleum, while the remaining 5% comes from the electrolysis of water [2]. Because these processes involve the use of nonrenewable resources or high energy consumption, the corresponding routes of hydrogen production are not sustainable or economically feasible. Over the last few years, biomass, mainly glycerol, has been used to produce hydrogen by different methods, such as steam reforming [3], gasification [4], autothermal reforming [5] and electrochemical reforming [6]. Alternatively, hydrogen can be also produced from biomass in mild conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure) through heterogeneous photocatalysis [2]. Photocatalysis has been extensively studied for environmental remediation (i.e., pollutant degradation) and solar energy conversion (i.e., hydrogen production and CO2 reduction) [7–15]. Up today, the photocatalytic production of hydrogen can be obtained mainly by two processes, i.e. either by the direct splitting of water into H2 and O2, or by the photo-reforming of organic compounds [16–22]. In many studies regarding the photocatalytic production of H2, different substances (e.g., organic acids, alcohols, sulfide/sulfite) acting as electron donors, have been generally used [23–26]. However, this approach requires the use of sacrificial agents in order to get a good hydrogen production, which makes the process expensive. On the contrary, if the organic pollutants present in wastewater are seen as electron donors for H2 production, the overall process may be potentially cost-effective. Glucose is the most diffused and cheapest carbohydrate as it can be directly obtained from cellulose, the most abundant and renewable biomass on Earth. It is used for ethanol or butanol production, a wide variety of useful bio-based chemicals as industrial feedstocks for bioplastics and also to obtain hydrogen [27]. But glucose is also present at high concentration in wastewaters from some agro-food industries. Accordingly, the heterogeneous photocatalysis applied to wastewater treatment offers the opportunity to simultaneously recovery valuable products (such as hydrogen and methane) to be converted into energy [28–30]. Moreover, photocatalytic technology can be also operated under natural sunlight [31] so drastically cutting energy costs down. The most widely used semiconductor in photocatalysis is TiO2 because of its physical and chemical properties, excellent stability, high availability and low cost [32]. With regard to the photocatalytic hydrogen production, the use of semiconductor (such as TiO2 or ZnO) doped with nobles metals (Au, Pt, Pd) has been extensively reported [28,33–38]. Alternatively, LaFeO3, one of the most common perovskite type oxide, has a general formula ABO3, where position A is occupied by the rare earth ion (La3+), and position B by the transition metal ion (Fe3+). LaFeO3 (conduction band potential=0.025eV [39]) has shown excellent photocatalytic activity because of its interesting properties such as high stability, non-toxicity and small band gap energy (2.07eV), that qualify this perovskite as visible light active photocatalyst [40,41]. Generally, the functional properties of perovskite materials can be controlled either by modulating the crystalline structure or by the incorporation of different metal ions into the perovskite lattice [42]. LaFeO3 powders doped with Sr and Cu have been recently tested in a photoelectrochemical process [42]. However, studies about the photocatalytic hydrogen production from aqueous solution on doped LaFeO3 systems are still lacking in the literature. Among the several possible dopants for perovskites, ruthenium is the most suitable since a large amount of Ru3+ ions can be introduced within the perovskite network (in particular by replacing the transition metal cation of the perovskite) keeping it single-phase [43]. Therefore, in this work Ru-doped LaFeO3 samples were synthesized and characterized and their effectiveness in the photocatalytic hydrogen production from glucose aqueous matrices has been assessed for the first time. The influences of Ru loading and photoreactor configuration have been analyzed. Finally, the optimized photocatalyst was also tested under visible light on a real wastewater taken from a brewing process."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of photocatalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of photocatalysts Ru-LaFeO3 samples were prepared by solution combustion synthesis, using citric acid as organic fuel and metal nitrate as metal precursor (oxidizer) [44]. In detail, 1.66g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Riedel-deHaen, 97wt%), 1.78g of La(NO3)3·6H2O (Fluka, 99%), 0.86g of citric acid (Fluka, 99wt%) and a specific amount of RuCl3 (Sigma Aldrich, 99%) used as dopant, were completely dissolved in 100mL of bidistilled water. The solution was kept stirred continuously at 60°C for 5min. Then, ammonium hydroxide (Carlo Erba, 37wt%) was slowly added to regulate the pH of the solution up to 7.0. The solution was dried at 130° C and then calcined at 300° C for 3h in static air using a muffle furnace to ignite the solution combustion reaction [41]. Different amounts of RuCl3 were used for the doping of LaFeO3 to obtain photocatalysts with different amounts of Ru (Table 1 ). The Ru nominal loading is expressed as molar percentage and it was evaluated through Eq. (1): (1) % m o l R u = n R u n L a + n F e ⋅ 100 Where: nRu is the number of moles of RuCl3 used in the synthesis; nLa is the number of moles of La(NO3)3·6H2O used in the synthesis; nFe is the number of moles of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O used in the synthesis."
3,Photocatalysts characterization,"2.2 Photocatalysts characterization Different techniques were used to characterize the photocatalysts. In particular the crystallite size and crystalline phase of Ru-LaFeO3 photocatalysts were studied with an X-ray diffractometer (Assing), using Cu-Kα radiation. Total Ru content of the samples were determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) in a thermoFischer ARL QUANT’X EDXRF spectrometer equipped with a rhodium standard tube as the source of radiation and with Si-Li drifted crystal detector. The specific surface area analysis was performed by BET method using N2 adsorption with a Costech Sorptometer 1042 after a pretreatment at 150°C for 30min in He flow (99.9990%). The Raman spectra of the samples were recorded with a Dispersive MicroRaman system (Invia, Renishaw), equipped with 785nm diode-laser, in the range 100–1000cm−1 Raman shift. UV–vis reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) of powder catalysts were recorded by a Perkin Elmer spectrometer Lambda 35 using a RSA-PE-20 reflectance spectroscopy accessory (Labsphere Inc., North Sutton, NH). All spectra were obtained using an 8° sample positioning holder, giving total reflectance relative to a calibrated standard SRS-010-99 (Labsphere Inc., North Sut-ton, NH). Band-gap energy determinations of the photocatalysts were obtained from Kubelka–Munk function F(R∞) by plotting [F(R∞) x h ν]2 vs. h ν [45–47]. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Assing, mod. LEO 420) was used to characterize the morphology of the samples at an accelerating voltage of 20kV."
4,Photocatalytic tests,"2.3 Photocatalytic tests The photocatalytic experiments for hydrogen production from glucose aqueous matrices were carried out in a photocatalytic pyrex cylindrical reactor [10,48,49] (ID=2.5cm) (R1) equipped with a N2 distributor device (Q=0.122 NL/min) to assure the absence of O2 during the tests. The experimental setup is represented in Fig. 1 . In a typical photocatalytic test, 0.12g of the catalyst were suspended in 80mL of an aqueous solution containing 1000mg/L of glucose (D + Glucose VWR, Sigma-Aldrich). The pH of the solutions has not been changed and it was equal to about 6 for all the photocatalytic tests, corresponding to the spontaneous pH of glucose aqueous solutions. To ensure complete mixing of the solution in the reactor, a peristaltic pump was used. The photoreactor was irradiated with a strip of UV-LEDs (nominal power: 10W; light intensity: 57mW/cm2) with wavelength emission in the range 375–380nm, or with a strip of visible LEDs with the main wavelength emission at about 460nm (nominal power: 10W; light intensity: 32mW/cm2). The LEDs strip was positioned around the external surface of the reactor so that the light source uniformly irradiated the reaction volume. The suspension was left in dark conditions for 2h to reach the adsorption-desorption equilibrium of glucose on the photocatalyst surface, and then the reaction was started under UV (or visible) light up to 4h. About 2mL of sample were taken from the photoreactor at different times and filtered (filter pore size: 0.45μm) in order to remove photocatalyst particles before the analyses. To evaluate the effect of reactor design, another photoreactor (R2) with a nominal volume equal to the first one (R1) but with an internal diameter equal to half (1.25cm) was also investigated. Finally, to evaluate the effect on real wastewater containing glucose, the optimized photocatalyst was tested under visible light on a wastewater sample taken from a brewing process (pH: 6; total suspended solids: 450mg/L, TOC: 1000mg/L)."
5,Chemical analysis,"2.4 Chemical analysis The characterization of the gaseous phase coming from the photoreactor was performed by continuous CO, CO2, O2, H2 and CH4 analyzers (ABB Advance Optima). The concentration of glucose was measured by a spectrophotometric method [50] at 490nm using UV–vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 35, Perkin Elmer). According to the method, 2mL of a carbohydrate solution was mixed with 1mL of 5wt% aqueous solution of phenol (Sigma-Aldrich) in a test tube. Subsequently, 5mL of concentrated sulfuric acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was added rapidly to the mixture. The gluconic acid formed during the irradiation time was quantified by analyzing the UV absorption of liquid samples at 264nm [26] using the same equipment. Leaching tests were carried out to check the release of La and Ru from the samples during the photocatalytic tests, analysing the solution by inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (7500c ICP-MS, Agilent)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Photocatalysts characterization,"3.1 Photocatalysts characterization 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the LaFeO3 photocatalyst doped with different amounts of ruthenium. XRD showed well indexed diffraction peaks, clearly indicating the formation of orthorhombic perovskite type structure, as reported in literature [41,51]. Additional peaks due to ruthenium oxide were not observed up to a Ru loading of 1.16mol%. In fact, for 1.16%Ru and 2.33%Ru catalysts, XRD patterns showed an additional diffraction peak at 2θ value of about 35° due to the presence of RuO2 on the surface, indicating only a partial doping of perovskite structure [52]. XRD data in the range 29–35° (Fig. 3 ) also show that the peak of the X-ray diffraction at 32.2° of undoped LaFeO3 shifted towards lower 2θ values for all the Ru-LaFeO3 samples. The reason for this phenomenon is that the radius of Ru3+ (0.0820nm) cation is larger than Fe3+ (0.0645nm), which leads to the decrease of unit cell lattice parameter, according to literature for perovskite samples doped with ruthenium [53]. This last result indicates that Ru3+ cation partially substitutes Fe3+ cation in the perovskite structure. The crystallite size of the samples was calculated by Scherrer formula for a diffraction line positioned at 2θ value of about 32° [51] (Table 1). Comparing doped and undoped LaFeO3, it can be observed that the doping process induced a slight decrease of photocatalysts crystallite size, though no clear relationship could be established between Ru contents. A similar result was previously observed for SrTiO3 perovskite doped with Ru [53]. 3.1.2 BET surface area and XRF results BET surface area values (SBET) of the catalysts are shown in Table 1. In agreement with XRD results, SBET values did not change when Ru amount used in the catalyst preparation was increased. In particular, SBET increased from 4 to 5m2/g for undoped LaFeO3 and Ru-doped LaFeO3, respectively. The total amount of Ru in the samples was determined by XRF (Table 1). In every case, the real Ru content well fits the nominal metal content indicating a good yield of the synthesis process. 3.1.3 UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra The reflectance spectra (Fig. 4 ) showed the typical absorption band edge of the LaFeO3 semiconductor at around 814 and 600nm for all the samples and it can be attributed to electron transitions from valence to conduction band (O2p →Fe3d) [54]. It is worthwhile to note that these bands disappeared for the catalysts with the higher Ru content (1.16%Ru and 2.33%Ru). This result could be due to the presence of RuO2 on the LaFeO3 surface, observed in XRD measurements (Fig. 2). The absorption edge of Ru-doped LaFeO3 catalysts has a red shift and also a stronger absorption than the pure LaFeO3 in the visible region. Similar results were observed for Li-doped LaFeO3 samples [55]. The data obtained from UV–vis reflectance spectra were used for evaluating the band-gap energy of the photocatalysts (Fig. 5 ). The obtained results are reported in Table 1. The increase of Ru amount resulted in a decrease of band-gap energy from 2.12 (band-gap of undoped LaFeO3) to 1.72eV for 2.33%Ru. The decrease of band-gap energy was due to the electronic transition from donor levels formed with dopants to the conduction band of the host photocatalysts [56]. In our case, the dopant exist as a trivalent ion (Ru3+) on the Fe3+ site, which forms a donor level at a lower potential than the top of the valence band composed of O 2p orbitals, and the apparent band-gap energy consequently became narrowed [56]. 3.1.4 SEM analysis The morphology of the LaFeO3 and Ru-doped LaFeO3 photocatalysts was investigated by SEM microscopy and the obtained results are presented in Fig. 6 . For sake of brevity, together with undoped LaFeO3, only the analysis on 0.47%Ru photocatalyst are reported, being similar the results obtained for all the others Ru-doped LaFeO3 samples. The SEM images show that the size of photocatalysts particles is not uniform due to agglomeration phenomena induced by particle–particle interactions. However, porous structure can be clearly seen in the SEM images, revealing the low density product, loose and porous material [57] due to the role of citric acid in the combustion of gel formed after the drying process at 130°C. In particular, at the combustion point, the citric acid generates gases that tried to come out from the gel by breaking the gel and generating the porous structure of LaFeO3 (Fig. 6a) and Ru-doped LaFeO3 (Fig. 6b) photocatalysts [57]."
8,Photocatalytic activity results,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity results 3.2.1 Effect of Ru content on H2 production and glucose degradation During the dark phase, no product was detected in gaseous phase. Fig. 7 reports the behavior of glucose degradation and hydrogen production as a function of Ru loading obtained after 4h of irradiation under UV-LEDs light at the spontaneous pH of the solution (pH=6). The hydrogen production was reported as the ratio between the μmoles produced and the catalyst amount (gcat) used in the tests. All the Ru-doped LaFeO3 photocatalysts demonstrated a better activity compared to undoped LaFeO3. The higher glucose degradation (about 70%) was achieved for 0.47%Ru catalyst. Glucose degradation efficiency increased as Ru% was increased from 0.12 to 0.47mol%, and decreased when Ru% was increased from 0.47 to 2.33mol%, reaching a value lower also than pure LaFeO3. In parallel, the same trend was observed for H2 production with the higher value (2179μmol/gcat) achieved for 0.47%Ru after the same irradiation time. The observed H2 production was higher than that one reported in the literature concerning the generation of hydrogen from the photocatalytic degradation of glucose on perovskites [41]. Ru3+ ions in the crystalline structure of the LaFeO3 could act as electron scavengers preventing the holes–electrons (h+/e−) recombination, and consequently causing the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity [58]. This effect could be predominant for a Ru loading up to 0.47mol%. The decreased efficiency observed when Ru% was increased from 0.47 to 2.33mol% is probably due to the presence of RuO2 on the catalyst surface (XRD analysis, Fig. 2). The presence of RuO2 crystallites may reduce the light penetration, retarding the activation of the photocatalyst and the generation of photoinduced charge carriers or can act as recombination centers diminishing the H2 production and the glucose degradation [24,59]. The possible release of La and Ru was investigated by inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analyzing the solution recovered after the photocatalytic test on 0.47%Ru sample showing that no release of La nor Ru was detected. According to these results 0.47mol% of Ru loading was considered to be the optimal value for the studied reaction. 3.2.2 Influence of the reactor configuration on the photocatalytic activity The optimized photocatalyst (0.47%Ru) was used to investigate the influence of the reactor configuration. In particular a new set of experiments was carried out with the new reactor (R2) with a nominal volume equal to the first one (R1) but with an internal diameter equal to half (1.25cm). The aim was to enhance the photonic transport by increasing the photons flow that intercepts the photocatalysts particles dispersed into the glucose solution. Fig. 8 shows the comparison in terms of photocatalytic activity between the two reactors. R2 resulted in a significantly higher glucose degradation compared to R1: in particular, an almost complete sugar degradation after 3h of UV irradiation was observed for R2 compared to 70% removal in 4h of UV irradiation observed for R1 (Fig. 8a). Noteworthy, glucose degradation had already reached about 70% after 2h of irradiation in the experiments performed with the reactor R2. Moreover, in parallel, the hydrogen production (Fig. 8b) was higher with the photoreactor R2 (3474μmol/L) compared to that one obtained with the photoreactor R1 (2179μmol/gcat). These results are in agreement with a previous work where a similar photoreactor configuration was investigated in the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) of a highly polluted wastewater [48]. It is underlined that the percentage of irradiated catalyst volume is different. For an ID of 1.25cm (photoreactor R2), it is larger than that obtained for an ID of 2.5cm (photoreactor R1) indicating that the attenuation of the available light energy is a key parameter that affects the photocatalytic performances of the reactor [60,61]. 3.2.3 Optimization of catalyst dosage for photocatalytic tests The optimization of the catalyst dosage was carried out under UV irradiation with the photoreactor R2 by testing different dosages of 0.47%Ru photocatalyst, in the range 0.75–3g/L. Photocatalytic efficiency increased as catalyst loading was increased up to 1.5g/L (Fig. 9 ). Further increase in catalyst loading resulted in a decreased degradation of glucose and lower H2 production. Possibly, the increase in the catalyst dosage over the optimum value resulted in a decreased light penetration through the solution because of the increased opacity of the aqueous suspension [62]. 3.2.4 Influence of initial glucose concentration Fig. 10 shows the effect of the initial glucose concentration on both its degradation (Fig. 10a) and hydrogen production (Fig. 10b), under UV light. In particular, glucose degradation decreased as the initial concentration was increased. It is worthwhile to note that an increase of the hydrogen production was observed up to 1000mg/L of initial concentration of glucose, in agreement with the results available in scientific literature [63]. The H2 production from glucose degradation could be obtained according to the sugar photoreforming reaction: (2) C6H12O6 +6H2O=12H2 +6CO2 In this reaction the H2/CO2 ratio is equal to 2. However, in our case, the ratio H2/CO2 is in the range 28–46, as initial glucose concentration was varied, and never equal to 2 (Fig. 11 a). On the other hand, the analysis of the liquid phase showed that gluconic acid is formed during photocatalytic process and the ratio between the moles of gluconic acid produced and the moles of glucose converted is approximately equal to 1 for all the tested concentrations (Fig. 11b), according to a previous work on LaFeO3 based photocatalysts [41]. Part of the additional CO2 produced could come from the decarboxylation reaction of gluconic acid [64,65]. But, taking into account the results reported in Fig. 11a, this last reaction is expected to take place at a limited extend. On the basis of these observations and considering the behavior shown in Fig. 11b, H2 and gluconic acid could be mainly produced from the photocatalytic degradation of glucose, according to the following reaction: (3) C6H12O6 +H2OH2 +C6H12O7 3.2.5 Water splitting reaction on 0.47%Ru photocatalyst The ability of 0.47%Ru photocatalyst in the hydrogen production through water splitting reaction (without glucose) under UV irradiation was also evaluated. The results are reported in Fig. 12 . The production of hydrogen and oxygen progressively increased as irradiation time increased. Moreover, the H2/O2 ratio was about 2. This result confirms that hydrogen is produced from water splitting according the following reaction: (4) H2OH2 +½O2 It is worthwhile to note that the amount of hydrogen reached a value of 1230μmol/gcat (after 4h of irradiation), significantly lower than that obtained in presence of glucose. In fact, to promote photocatalytic water splitting, various oxidizing sacrificial agents have been added to water; the role of sacrificial agent is to scavenge the coproduced O2 due to water splitting, and, thus, to prevent the reverse reaction of O2 with H2 to H2O [23,66]. Typically, the sacrificial compounds are hydrocarbons such as saccharides, alcohol and acetic acid [67]. However it must be taken into account that, in our case, the water splitting reaction plays an important role in the photocatalytic hydrogen production."
9,Photocatalytic activity of 0.47%Ru under visible light irradiation,"3.3 Photocatalytic activity of 0.47%Ru under visible light irradiation The effect of different light sources (UV or visible LEDs) was evaluated on the 0.47%Ru catalyst (Fig. 13 ), which showed the best performances. According to UV–vis DRS results (Table 1), this catalyst was expected to be active also in the presence of visible light (band-gap equal to 1.98eV). In particular, the photocatalytic experiment was carried out with a solution containing 1000mg/L of glucose, a catalyst dosage equal to 1.5g/L and the optimized R2 configuration. The observed glucose degradation was equal to 40% after 4h of visible light irradiation (Fig. 13a) and the hydrogen production was equal to 1098μmol/gcat (Fig. 13b) after the same irradiation time. These results, also if lower than that obtained in presence of UV light, confirm the activity of the optimized photocatalyst also in presence of visible light irradiation."
10,Photocatalytic hydrogen production from real wastewater with 0.47%Ru catalyst under visible light,"3.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production from real wastewater with 0.47%Ru catalyst under visible light Since the investigated photocatalytic process was really effective in the hydrogen production from glucose-containing solutions, the effect of the phtocatalyst 0.47% Ru was also investigated in the treatment and valorization of real wastewater from brewing process (supplied by an Italian company producing beer) (Fig. 14 ). the wastewater sample was filtered before the photocatalytic process to remove the suspended solids. Typically the main component of this type of wastewater is maltose (C12H22O11), a sugar of the family of glucides disaccharides, consisting of two glucose molecules bonded by an oxygen atom [66]. The degradation of maltose during photocatalytic process (visible light) was evaluated by measuring absorbance changes at the wavelength of 268nm (Fig. 14a). After 4h of visible light irradiation, a degradation of maltose equal to 50% was observed. In parallel photocatalytic hydrogen production reached the value of about 2128μmol/gcat within four hours of irradiation (Fig. 14b). These results confirm the applicability of the photocatalytic process also to a real wastewater and the possibility to valorize the wastewater obtaining hydrogen from the degradation of maltose under visible light."
11,Conclusions,"Non-doped and Ru-doped LaFeO3 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by the solution combustion synthesis method. Characterization results showed the formation of orthorhombic perovskite type structure and that Ru3+ cation partially substitutes Fe3+ cation in the perovskite structure. Moreover the absorption edge of Ru-doped LaFeO3 catalysts has a red shift and also a stronger absorption than the pure LaFeO3 in the visible region due to the electronic transition from donor levels formed with Ru3+ to the conduction band of the host perovskite structure. The highest photocatalytic glucose degradation and hydrogen production was observed for 0.4mol% Ru-doped LaFeO3 sample (0.47%Ru). Ru3+ in the crystalline structure of the LaFeO3 could act as electron scavengers preventing the holes–electrons recombination, and consequently causing the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. For Ru content higher than 0.47mol%, the photocatalytic activity decreased because of the presence of RuO2 on the catalyst surface. Therefore 0.47mol% of Ru loading is considered to be an optimal value for the studied reaction. In particular, after 4h of UV irradiation with 0.47%Ru, glucose degradation and hydrogen production were equal to 70% and 2179μmol/gcat, respectively. Moreover the effect of the reactor configuration on the hydrogen production and degradation of glucose was assessed. The results showed that with the same volume but reducing the diameter of the photocatalytic reactor from 2.5 to 1.25cm, the photonic transport was enhanced and consequently the activity of the 0.47%Ru increased. In particular, under UV light, the hydrogen production passed from 2179 to 3474μmol/gcat and the glucose degradation was complete after 3h of irradiation. The optimized 0.47%Ru has shown high efficiency also under visible light obtaining about 40% of glucose degradation after 4h of irradiation and a hydrogen production equal to 1919μmol/L. Finally the efficiency of 0.47%Ru photocatalyst under visible light was also tested on a real wastewater from the brewing process; the results showed a hydrogen production equal to 2128μmol/gcat in 4h of irradiation denoting a good performance of the optimized photocatalytic system also for the treatment of real wastewater with the aim to obtain the simultaneously degradation and valorization (through hydrogen production) of organic pollutants."
