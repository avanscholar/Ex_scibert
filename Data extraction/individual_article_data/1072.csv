0,Introduction,"With the clean energy demand and aggravated environmental pollutants caused by traditional fossil fuels, clean energy sources are urgently desired. Hydrogen has thus been expected as candidate for clean and renewable energy carrier. Steam reforming from hydrocarbons, electrolysis of water and heavy oil oxidation of hydrogen production is traditional hydrogen production method. Although these means remain high efficiency in hydrogen production, large amount of energy consumption and hazardous substances production in the conversion process have limited the development of friendly hydrogen resources. Therefore, the use of semiconductors as photocatalysts to decompose water into hydrogen via solar energy has been considered as promising way to solve these problems [1–11]. Since the discovery of water splitting activity of TiO2 to hydrogen under light irradiation in 1972 [12], large amount of semiconductor materials, such as C3N4 [13–16], ZnO [17], CdS [18–20], Bi2MoO6 [21,22], CuOx [23,24], and CdSe [25,26], have been found and intensively studied for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Among them, CdS with a narrow energy gap (2.4 eV) with effectively respond to visible light was found to have suitable conduction band minimum [27–32], which is suitable for the hydrogen evolution reaction. So far, CdS nanomaterials with various morphology, such as nanorod [33–35], quantum dot [36,37], nanowire [38,39], flake [40,41], flower or related shape [42,43], nanosheet [44–46], have been synthesized. For example, Yu et al. synthesized hierarchical CdS nanoribbon-assembled microflowers with improved visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity [42]. Han et al. synthesized ultrathin Ni/CdS nanosheets with high photocatalytic hydrogen production [47]. To develop high performance of CdS-based photocatalyst, we have recently synthesized CdS-diethylenetriamine (DETA) nanoribbons with high specific surface area [48]. We combine the rigidity of inorganic CdS with the flexibility of organic DETA to form CdS-DETA organic-inorganic hybrid materials. Many small organic amine molecules in DETA connect a large number of CdS nanoparticles (NPs) together to form hybrid materials with large specific surface area. Compared with the traditional CdS, the photocatalytic properties and stability of CdS-DETA have been improved. Nevertheless, CdS-DETA still has the disadvantage of rapid recombination of photoexcited charger carriers, the shortage of active sites for catalytic hydrogen evolution and inevitable photocorrosion. Although deposition of Pt can effectively provide active sites for hydrogen production in the catalytic procedures, using expensive and resources scanty noble metal as co-catalyst has limited possible application of CdS [49–55]. As famous non noble metal material, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been extensively studied in the field of hydrogen production because of its low cost, good physical and chemical stability and especially low hydrogen evolution overpotential [56–59]. Kumar et al. achieved enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production by depositing few layered MoS2 with nonmetal doping on CdS nanorods [60]. Zhao et al. successfully synthesized the CdS NPs supported on MoS2 nanoplatelets with improved photocatalytic hydrogen production [61]. It has been found in recent studies that defective MoS2 with Mo vacancies is capable of further reducing overpotential of hydrogen evolution reaction [62–65]. Inspired by these works, Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites are engineered by depositing defective Mo15S19 NPs on surface of CdS-DETA. The defective Mo15S19 with abundant unsaturated Mo atoms provides plentiful active sites for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The optical property of Mo15S19/CdS-DETA composite is recorded by UV–Vis DRS, which manifests that Mo15S19/CdS-DETA intensively responds to visible irradiation. Furthermore, results of electrochemical tests reveal that Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites are inclined to generate more holes and electrons and boost the separation of photoinduced charge carriers. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA system can reach 3.61 mmol g−1 h−1, which is 9.5 and 2.19 times as high as that of CdS NPs and CdS-DETA."

3,Synthesis of CdS-DETA,"2.2 Synthesis of CdS-DETA The CdS-DETA nanoribbons were synthesized by hydrothermal method. Firstly, 0.164 g CdCl2·2.5H2O and 0.128 g sublimation sulphur was dissolved into the mixture of DETA (24 mL) and DW (12 mL) after stirring for 30 min, until the yellow powder was dispersed uniformly. After that, it was moved into a 50 mL normal autoclave and heated at 353 K for 48 h. The synthesized photocatalysts were repeatedly washed with DW and then placed in a freezer at 253 K. The frozen solid product was placed in a lyophilizer for 18 h before the CdS-DETA nanobelts were obtained."
4,Fabrication of the Mo15S19/CdS-DETA,"2.3 Fabrication of the Mo15S19/CdS-DETA Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites were fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method. Generally, a certain of CdS-DETA, 5.8 mg H24Mo7N6O24·4H2O, 100 mg thiourea and 100 mg PVP were added to the reaction vessel, then, 35 mL DW was added into reaction vessel and stirred for 24 h. Then, the solution was transferred to the autoclave, and heated at 473 K for 24 h. After that, the reacted sample was washed several times with absolute ethanol and DW. The centrifuged samples were then frozen and placed in a freeze dryer for 18 h. Finally, n%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA was obtained. Where n is the weight ratio of Mo15S19."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The crystal structure of Mo15S19, CdS-DETA and Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites were investigated by XRD (DX-2000). TEM (JEM-2100 Electron Microscope) and SEM (Hitachi S5500) were reported to describe the particle sizes and structure of the samples. The chemical composition of Mo15S19, CdS-DETA and Mo15S19/CdS-DETA system were determined by XPS (Thermo ESCALAB 250) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR NICOLET 6700). UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS PerkinElmer Lambda 950) measurements were inspected with BaSO4 as a reflectance standard. The specific surface area of phtocatalysts was investigated by N2 adsorption data (ASAP2010). PL spectra of Mo15S19/CdS-DETA system were acquired by FLS920 combined fluorescence life time. The apparent quantum efficiency (QE) for photocatalytic H2 evolution was tested and calculated according to Eq. (1): (1) QE = number of reacted electrons number of incident photons × 100 = number of evolved H 2 molecules × 2 number of incident photons × 100"
6,Results and discussion,"As shown in Fig. 1 , in order to further study the Mo15S19/CdS-DETA system, we describe the synthesis process of Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites. In the Step 1, the Cd2+ and S2− are provided by CdCl2·2.5H2O and sublimed sulfur, respectively. The DETA in the reactor was firstly protonated at 353 k, then Cd2+ and S2− formed multilayer CdS nanosheets. As indicated in Fig. S1, the protonated DETA was inserted into the layered structure of CdS and the banded inorganic-organic CdS-DETA hybrid materials were formed by continuous chemical reaction for 48 h. In the Step 2, the Mo6+ provided by H24Mo7N6O24·4H2O and the S2− provided by thiourea. First, a large number of Mo6+ and S2− were linked by PVP at 473 K in the reactor, and then Mo15S19 was in situ formed on CdS-DETA. Finally, Mo15S19/CdS-DETA systems were produced through continuous chemical reaction in the reactor. To confirm the crystalline form of the material, XRD is used to characterize the structure of Mo15S19, CdS-DETA and Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 2 , The main peaks of CdS-DETA at 24.8°, 26.6°, 28.2°, 36.7°, 43.7°, 47.9°, 50.9° and 70.9° are observed and can be indexed to the (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (1 1 2) and (2 1 1) of hexagonal CdS (JCPDS No. 41–1049), which indicate no significant impurity. The main peaks of Mo15S19 at 12.1° and 33.2° are observed and can be indexed to the (1 0 1) and (1 2 3) of hexagonal Mo15S19 (JCPDS No. 40-0936). The hydrothermally synthesized n%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA diffraction peak is in good agreement with the pure CdS standard hexagonal phase (JCPDS No. 41-1049). However, Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites diffraction peak were obviously strengthened. This is due to the recombination of CdS-DETA crystals in the process of high temperature synthesis. In addition, the reconstituted CdS-DETA combined with Mo15S19 more easily. Moreover, no peak of Mo15S19 was found in the diffraction peak of n%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA because of the low content of Mo15S19. To better investigate the Mo15S19 on enhancing hydrogen evolution activity, micromorphology of pure substance and nanocomposites have been investigated via TEM and SEM. As shown in Fig. 3 a, CdS-DETA presents morphology of very thin nanoribbon. And the diameter of these nanoribbons is about 8–20 nm. As shown in Fig. 3b, Mo15S19 is a flower-like assembly of nanosheets. The diameter of the nanoflower is about 140 nm. Fig. 3c has shown that Mo15S19 is anchored on CdS-DETA nanosheets, forming a composite material with 2D/2D heterostructure interfaces. The diameter of the nanocomposites is about 30–100 nm. In Fig. 3d, the interplane spacing of CdS-DETA is 0.333 nm, which is consistent with the (0 0 2) peak of CdS. And the lattice and heterojunction of 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA can be clearly seen through the HRTEM. Furthermore, the interplanar spacing of Mo15S19 is 0.738 nm, which is in accordance with the calculation from the (1 0 1) peak in the XRD spectrum. As indicated in Fig. 3e, a large number of CdS-DETA nanoribbons are intertwined. Fig. 3f shows uniformly distributed flower-like Mo15S19 nanospheres. Fig. 3g shows 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites. A large number of Mo15S19 nanospheres are decomposed to form a large number of nanosheets and composite with CdS-DETA nanoribbons. Fig. 3h–j show the EDS spectra of CdS-DETA nanoribbons, Mo15S19 microflowers, and Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites, respectively. The results showed that the as-prepared samples are very pure, and no other impurities can be found. As comparison, CdS NPs are prepared. As indicated in Fig. S2a, the size of CdS NPs is not uniform, and only Cd and S elements are detected (Fig. S2b). As indicated in Fig. 4 , the XPS test was performed to accurately determine each chemical element in 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposite, CdS-DETA and Mo15S19. As shown in Fig. 4a, the spectrum of 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites indicates that there are C, Mo, Cd, N, S and O elements in the Mo15S19/CdS-DETA system. N 1s and C 1s are from DETA of inorganic-organic CdS-DETA hybrids (Fig. S1). High-resolution Cd 3d XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 4b, the binding energies of Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 in 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA correspond to 411.40 and 404.67 eV [66,67], respectively. The binding energies of Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 in CdS-DETA correspond to 410.07 and 403.27 eV, respectively. Compared with CdS-DETA, the peak value of Cd 3d in 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA shifts to the left is about 0.3 eV to a high position. In Fig. 4c, the binding energies of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 in 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA correspond to 161.6 and 160.7 eV [68], respectively. The binding energies of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 in Mo15S19 correspond to 162.0 and 161.2 eV [69], respectively. And the binding energies of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 in CdS-DETA correspond to 161.2 and 160.0 eV, respectively. Compared with CdS-DETA and Mo15S19, the peak value of S 2p in 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA shifts to the middle position between Mo15S19 and CdS-DETA. In Fig. 4d, the binding energies of Mo6+ 3d5/2, Mo6+ 3d3/2, Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2 in 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA correspond to 232.2, 235.0, 228.0 and 231.3 eV, respectively. In addition, the binding energies of Mo6+ 3d5/2, Mo6+ 3d3/2, Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2 in Mo15S19 correspond to 232.5, 235.3, 228.3 and 231.5 eV, respectively. The occurrence of Mo6+ is due to the exposure of catalysts to atmosphere [61]. In Fig. 4e, the main peak position of C 1s of 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA is 284.8 eV, and that of C 1s of CdS-DETA is about 0.3 eV lower than that of 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA. This indicates that the binding of CdS-DETA to Mo15S19 is a composite material, and DETA does not disappear during the process of recombination. Thus, the binding energy of various elements of the 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA has different degrees of offset with respect to pure CdS-DETA and Mo15S19, which may be due to the fact that the reconstitution of atoms between Mo15S19 and CdS-DETA has resulted in mutual interaction in the process of combination with each other [70]. It further explains that Mo15S19 and CdS-DETA are composites rather than physical mixture. Fig. 5 a indicates the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms for Mo15S19, CdS-DETA and Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites. In addition, the pore size distribution of 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA was inserted in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b shows BET surface area of different samples. The specific surface area of CdS-DETA and Mo15S19 were 51.6 and 21.7 m2 g−1, respectively. Moreover, the specific surface area of Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites is larger than that of Mo15S19, which results in significant increase of the specific surface area of CdS-DETA. Furthermore, with the growing proportion of CdS-DETA in nanocomposites, the specific surface area of nanocomposites increases gradually. In order to investigate the light absorption capacity of pure material and nanocomposites, we conducted UV–Vis diffuse reflectance studies. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the pure CdS-DETA nanoribbon displays a significant absorption edge at 550 nm, which correspond to band-gap energy of 2.35 eV shown in Fig. 6b. Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites show absorption characteristics of Mo15S19 and CdS-DETA due to the growth of Mo15S19 on the CdS-DETA. Moreover, as it can be seen in Fig. 6a, due to the addition of Mo15S19, the CdS-DETA-based composite significantly enhances visible light absorption at 550–800 nm. Thus, Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites show higher visible light capture than CdS-DETA, which indicates that the nanocomposites are visible light photocatalyst with potential application value. Fig. 6b shows the linear transformation of the CdS-DETA absorption curves. Using the following formula for calculating the energy bandgap (Eg ) [71]: (2) α ( h v ) = A ( h v - E g ) 1 / 2 α and hv are the absorbance and energy of radiation, respectively. Eg energy is 2.35 for CdS-DETA. Valence band energy (EVB ) and conduction band energy (ECB ) of photocatalyst are calculated by following formula [72]: (3) E VB = X - E e + 0.5 E g (4) E CB = E VB - E g X is electronegative semiconductor. Ee is a constant (4.5 eV). According to Eqns. (2) and (3), EVB of CdS-DETA is 1.825 eV. ECB of CdS-DETA is -0.525 eV. Fig. S3 shows the color change of the different samples. CdS-DETA is yellow and Mo15S19 is black. The color of Mo15S19/CdS-DETA system is changed from dull yellow to black with more content of Mo15S19. In order to further explore the transfer and separation of photoexcited holes and electrons in Mo15S19/CdS-DETA system, the PL test is carried out. As shown in Fig. 7 , the PL intensity of the nanocomposites significantly reduced compared to the pure CdS-DETA and Mo15S19, and the 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA has the lowest PL intensity. This shows that the hybridization of CdS-DETA and Mo15S19 can effectively enhance the separation rate of electron-hole pairs [73,74]. The effective separation of photoexcited charge carriers can improve the photocatalytic activity. It is indicated that the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of composites has been promoted by adding Mo15S19, and the photocatalytic performance of 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA is the best in all of Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites. Beside the photophysical characters, electrochemical analysis of catalsyts has been done via LSV analysis [75,76]. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that Mo15S19 has much lower overpotential for hydrogen evolution than CdS-DETA. Via small amount of Mo15S19 deposition on CdS-DETA surface, the hydrogen evolution overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 has been dramatically reduced and is close to that of CdS-DETA, indicating surface deposition of 3%Mo15S19 on CdS-DETA would effectively increase hydrogen evolution reaction activity of 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA. In brief, Mo15S19 is not only effective on reducing recombination of photo-generated electron and hole, but also contributes to the increase of surface catalytic hydrogen evolution activity. In order to explore the velocity of separation of electrons and holes in each material, we conducted an experimental test of the photocurrent density–time curves. In the Fig. 9 , the results show that 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA has higher electron and hole separation efficiency than pure CdS-DETA and Mo15S19. It is obvious that the Mo15S19 catalyst effectively hinders the recombination of CdS-DETA electrons and holes. Therefore, it is in accordance with the results of catalytic hydrogen evolution test and PL test. EIS Nyquist diagram analysis is carried out to explore the electron transfer velocity of each material. In Fig. 10 , Mo15S19 has the largest arc, and the 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites have a smaller radius compared to pure CdS-DETA. It reveals that the photocatalytic hydrogen production of 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA is the best among the Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites and it has the highest charge transfer efficiency. Thus, it can be further explained that the charge carriers transfer efficiency of Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites is improved by introducing Mo15S19 [77,78]. Photocatalytic hydrogen production of different ratios of Mo15S19/CdS-DETA, 3.0 wt%Pt/CdS-DETA, 3.0 wt%Pt/CdS, CdS, CdS-DETA and Mo15S19 has been shown in Fig. 11 . Photocatalytic hydrogen production of CdS-DETA without any co-catalyst is found to be 1.65 mmol g−1 h−1, which is much higher than that of CdS NPs (0.38 mmol g−1 h−1). The synergetic chemical coupling effect between CdS and DETA and large surface area (Fig. S4) lead to a marked increase in the hydrogen production [37]. Although Mo15S19 itself is not active for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, an improvement of the photocatalytic activity was observed when CdS-DETA was loaded with 3.0 wt% Mo15S19 (3.61 mmol g−1 h−1), which was 9.5, 2.19, 1.45, 1.64 and 1.46 times higher than that of CdS NPs, CdS-DETA, 1%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA, 5%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA and 3.0 wt%Pt/CdS, respectively. The QE of 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA is 29.4%. This result is very similar with 3.0 wt%Pt/CdS-DETA composite (3.80 mmol g−1 h−1). However, when 3% of Mo15S19 was physically mixed with 97% of CdS-DETA, the photocatalytic activity of the mixture was only 1.04 mmol g−1 h−1. As a noble-metal-free material, Mo15S19 can also act as effective co-catalyst to promote photocatalytic hydrogen evolution over CdS-DETA. Furthermore, CdS-DETA is good candidate substrate to improve visible-light-driven energy conversion. Each material has its specific chemical reaction [79]. In order to study the electronic trend of the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites, we obtained the results by theoretical calculation and drew the electronic trend of Mo15S19/CdS-DETA and the mechanism diagram of catalytic hydrogen evolution based on these results. The optimized models of the CdS (0 0 1) facet and Mo15S19 (1 0 1) facet were shown in Fig. 12 a and 12b, respectively. The average potential profiles along C axis were calculated to obtain the work functions of CdS (0 0 1) facet and Mo15S19 (1 0 1) facet and shown in Fig. 12c and 12d, respetively. It is well known that the work function of the photocatalyst is a major parameter in judging the charge transfer direction between different semiconductors [80,81]. Moreover, the work functions of CdS (0 0 1) facet and Mo15S19 (1 0 1) facet were calculated as follows: (5) Φ = E vac - E F where E F and E vac are lectrostatic potential of the Fermi energy and vacuum energy, respectively. The work functions of CdS (0 0 1) facet and Mo15S19 (1 0 1) facet were 4.77 and 5.08 eV, respectively. Namely, the E F of Mo15S19 (1 0 1) facet was lower than that of the CdS (0 0 1) facet according to eq. (4). Therefore, the photogenerated electron will transfer from CdS (0 0 1) facet with a higher E F to Mo15S19 (1 0 1) facet with a lower E F level until the two E F reach the same level. The effective space separation of photogenerated electrons and holes prolonged the lifetime of electrons and holes and improved the hydrogen evolution of Mo15S19/CdS. Therefore, Fig. 12e and 12f can be drawn based on the above results. As shown in Fig. 12e, the Mo15S19 with the S-vacancy is combined with the CdS-DETA nanoribbons, and the electrons transferred from CdS-DETA to Mo15S19 [82,83]. In Fig. 12f, the electrons of CdS-DETA is stimulated from the VB to CB in the light of the visible light [84,85]. And the electrons are transferred from CdS-DETA to the surface of Mo15S19. Then, on the surface of Mo15S19, a large number of H+ get electrons and are reduced to hydrogen [86,87]. Excessive holes in the CdS-DETA oxidize the S2− and SO3 2− ions in the sacrificial agent (100 mL of a mixed solution of 0.25 M Na2SO3 and 0.35 M Na2S) to S and SO4 2−. In this way, the redox reaction is carried out separately, which makes the separation of photoinduced carriers accelerated and effectively enhances hydrogen production of the catalyst [88]. In order to further explore the stability of materials, we carried out four times of 16 h cycle experiments on 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites and CdS-DETA nanobelts under visible light. As shown in Fig. 13 , after four cycles, the photocatalytic activity of CdS significantly decreases because of photocorrosion [89]. CdS-DETA nanobelts exhibit a certain antiphotocorrosion performance. However, the hydrogen production performance of 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA system keeps stable with the change of light duration. The crystalline structure of used 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA system is further tested by XRD (Fig. S5). The structure of 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA can be kept well after four-cycling measurements. Thus, it can be concluded that the addition of Mo15S19 not only promotes the photocatalytic hydrogen production of CdS-DETA-based materials, but prolongs their photostability."
7,Conclusions,"In summary, Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites were designed and fabircated by two step hydrothermal method. Compared with CdS-DETA hybrid, the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen production has been greatly improved. The hydrogen production rate of 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA will reach to 3.61 mmol g−1 h−1, which is similar with 3%Pt/CdS-DETA. This value is 9.5 and 2.19 times as high as that of CdS NPs and CdS-DETA, respectively. The excellent visible light photocatalytic hydrogen production properties of Mo15S19/CdS-DETA nanocomposites are attributed to the effective separation of electrons and holes, which enhances the ability of CdS-DETA nanoribbons to capture visible light. This work supplies the possibility of using solar energy to enhance the catalytic performance of the inorganic–organic hybrid catalyst. In addition, Mo15S19/CdS-DETA has also expanded the application field of CdS."
