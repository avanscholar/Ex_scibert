0,Introduction,"Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2ER) is a promising and feasible method regarding with which to sustainably transform CO2 into value-added chemicals or fuels driven by low-grade renewable electricity [1–3], enabling both renewable energy storage and a carbon cycle [4–6]. Among various products of CO2ER, lower alcohols (methanol and ethanol) appeared to be the most desirable products, which may serve as fuels directly or blended with gasoline to give an overall cleaner-burning fuels [7,8]. Recently, several efforts have done to develop electrocatalysts for a direct conversion of CO2 to methanol [9,10] or ethanol [11,12]. Based on the thermodynamic redox potential (vs. RHE) reported for each reaction step, CO2 molecular activation by gain one electron (−1.90 V) contributed large to the reaction potential [13], and the following multiple proton-electron transference determined the reaction rate and the total FE (faradaic efficiency) of methanol and ethanol. However, CO2ER into lower alcohols is a slow kinetic process due to the complex transfer of multiple protons and electrons leading to severe challenges [14], including poor FE, high overpotential, and low selectivity, which urges us to design new catalysts to address the above efficiency and selectivity issues. To date, many types of electrocatalysts for CO2ER into lower alcohols have been reported, such as metal nanomaterials, metal oxides, organic-inorganic hybrid materials, ect. Among them, the transition metal or their oxides have shown efficient catalytic performance, such as Cu2O-TiO2 [15], Co3O4 [16], oxide-derived CuZn [17], etc. It can be attributed to special valence band (MOM) structure of the transition metal oxides with variable valence states, which the d-orbital electrons of the transition metal are easily overlapped with the p-orbital electrons of CO2 to form *CO2 δ −, promoting CO2 molecular activation to decreasing the overpotential. However, the direct electroreduction of CO2 to ethanol (CO2-C2H5OH) is still an enormous challenge, which involves not only the transfer of multiple proton-electrons but also CC coupling with high overpotential [18–20]. Construction of catalysts with multifunctional active sites may provide an effective way to approach the above problems and promote CO2ER into ethanol. For example, Ag alloy or Ag-metal oxide catalysts have been extensively reported to enhance the electroreduction of CO2 to ethanol [21,22]. Lv et al. [20] prepared elastic Ag-anchored N-doped graphene/carbon foam for the selective electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to ethanol with FE of 82.1–85.2% at −0.6 to −0.7 V vs. RHE (0.35 mA cm−2) by direct carbonization of melamine foam loaded with graphene oxide and silver salt. Nanoporous Cu-Ag alloy [21] have been shown to improve the selectivity of CO2ER toward ethanol with FE of 28% at −0.7 V vs. RHE (70 mA cm−2) by modulating the adsorption of key intermediates (*CO or *CHO) on the catalyst surface. Thanks to its bimetallic structure, Ag-based catalysts give the possibility to strongly absorb the *CO or *CHO intermediates, and maintains a steady supply of electrons for dimerization of *CO or *CHO intermediates and multiple electron transfer for the generation of methanol and ethanol [23]. However, even after such research about Ag-base composite catalysts, achieving high selectivity (>FE 50% with ≥10 mA cm−2) for lower alcohols (methanol or ethanol) at high activity while requiring low energy input (applied potential −1.0 V vs. RHE) still remains a major challenge in the field [24]. Moreover, it is highly desirable to understand the mechanism of CO2ER to increase the selectivity for lower alcohols. In this work, we focus on enhancing the selectivity of CO2ER toward lower alcohols by introducing transition metals and their oxides (Ag, Co & Ce) on the surface of low graphitized carbon (LGC) to control the electronic structure of the catalyst surface. Low graphitic carbon (LGC) black-supported Ag-Co3O4-CeO2 composites catalyst was fabricated, which possessed multi-active sites and excellent electronic conductivity. The obtained Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC catalyst exhibited high selectivity for CH3OH and C2H5OH production with a FEtotal of 77.6% at −0.85 V vs. RHE in CO2 saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution. Furthermore, this multi-active sites catalyst showed no obvious decay during 60 h continuous electrolysis."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation The CeO2/LGC was prepared as follows: LGC was obtained by heat-treating Vulcan XC-72R (Cabot Corporation, USA) at 1100 °C for 3 h under an argon atmosphere. LGC-supported CeO2 (CeO2/LGC) was synthesized by precipitating ammonia cerium nitrate (0.95 mmol (NH4)2Ce(NO3)3 in 67 mL water) with urea in aqueous solution and sonicated for 30 min. The obtained mixture was fluxed at 120 °C for 27 h, suspended solids were filtered and rinsed with water, dried at 110 °C in air overnight, and then calcined at 350 °C for 3 h in Ar atmosphere with heating rate of 5 °C/min to obtain black powder samples (CeO2/LGC). The theoretical composition of CeO2/LGC composite was 23.5 wt.% CeO2 : 66.5 wt.% LGC. The Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC was prepared by the impregnation method as follows: 3 ml Co(NO3)3 aqueous solution (0.02 mol/L), 3 ml AgNO3 aqueous solution (0.013 mol/L) and 78.8 mg CeO2/LGC were added into 14 ml ethanol aqueous solution (Vwater : Vethanol = 2:1), after sonicated for 2 h, the mixture was freeze dried. Finally, the sample was calcined at 550 °C for 3 h in Ar atmosphere with heating rate of 5 °C/min, and the synthesized sample was collectively denoted as Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC (xAg-yCo3O4-CeO2/LGC, x = y = 5, the weight percent of Ag and Co3O4 in CeO2/LGC or LGC, respectively). For comparison, Ag/LGC, Co3O4/LGC, Ag-CeO2/LGC and Co3O4-CeO2/LGC were also prepared in the same method and the same weight percent of Ag or Co3O4 (5%)."
3,Physical characterizations,"2.2 Physical characterizations The crystalline structures of the samples were examined by X-ray diffraction apparatus (Rigaku D/max-3C) equipped with a graphite monochromator for Cu Kα (40 kV, 40 mA) radiation. The catalyst morphology was evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200 s G2, Thermo scientific) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, JSM-7800 F, JEOL) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The elemental compositions of the catalyst were detected by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF, XRF-1800, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with Rh-target X-ray tube. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the samples was analyzed on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD (Thermo ESCAlab250) instrument under ultra-high vacuum, with monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) at power of 450 W (30 mA, 15 kV)."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements CO2ER were conducted with a standard three electrode system in a gastight two compartment electrochemical cell (separated by a piece of Nafion-212 membrane), with 0.1 M KHCO3 solution (298 K, pH = 6.8) as electrolyte. All the measurements were performed on an Autolab 302 N station. Pt plate and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The work electrodes were prepared by coating the catalyst with different loading amount (between 0.3∼1.5 mg cm−2) onto a pre-polished glassy disk electrode (GCE) of 3.0 mm diameter, followed by drying air to remove the solvent. Briefly, the catalysts slurry was obtained by ultrasonicating the suspension of each catalyst and Nafion solution (5 wt%, Dupont) in isopropanol. After purging with high-purity N2 (99.999%) for 0.5 h to exclude any dissolved gases, the CO2ER reaction started with inlet pure CO2 (99.99%, 10 ml min−1) for at least 0.5 h to obtain CO2 saturated electrolyte in 0.1 M KHCO3 (298 K). Cycling Voltammetry (CV) and Liner sweep voltammetric (LSV) test were conducted with continued inlet CO2 to evaluate the catalytic activity of the catalysts. The controlled potential electrolysis was performed via chronoamperometry method. The liquid products were determined using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR, Bruker 500 UltraShield™). The gaseous products were analyzed by chromatographs (Beijing Purkinje, GC-1100) equipped with a TCD detector and FID detector as well as Molsieve 5A column once every 30 min during the electrolysis. The relative amounts of gaseous products were calculated by the normalization method, and CO2 conversion was calculated as following [25]: X ( C O 2 ) = V i n × C i n − V o u t × C o u t V i n × C i n × 100 % Where Vin (mL/min) and Vout (mL/min) were the volume of inlet and outlet gas respectively, Cin (0.9999) and Cout were CO2 concentration corresponding to the inlet and outlet gas, which was detected by chromatographs. The faradaic efficiency (FE) calculation for liquid product [26]: F E % = N p r o d u c t N t o t a l × 100 % = C p r o d u c t × n × N A × n x I 0 × t e × 100 % where Cproduct is the concentration of gas product (ppm) calculated via external standard curve method, n presents the mole number of CO, t is the time of CO taking to fill the loop (s), I0 is related to current (A) recorded by chronoamperogram. FE was calculated according to the following equation [27]: F E ( % ) = N p r o d u c t N t o t a l × 100 % = C p r o d u c t × V 0 × N A × n x Q e × 100 % Where Cproduct indicates the concentration of liquid product (formate, methanol or ethanol) in catholyte, V0 (mL) expresses the volume of catholyte, n x (e) shows the number of electrons required for produce formate, and Q is the total charge (C) during the reaction process according to chronoamperogram."
5,Density functional theory calculations,"2.4 Density functional theory calculations All calculations were performed using the DMol3 package. The DFT semi-core pseudopotential (DSSP) method was employed to treat the relativistic effect of transition metals by introducing some degree of relativistic effective potential. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PBE functional and the long-range dispersion correction via Grimme’s scheme were adopted to describe the exchange and correlation effects [28]. The double numerical plus polarization (DNP) was chosen as the atomic orbital basis set. The method of Methfessel-Paxton (MP) with a smearing width of 0.005 Ha was adopted for transition metal surfaces and interfaces [29]. Ag-Co3O4-CeO2 was described by an simplified model system [30], a (Co3O4)3 cluster and (111) Ag slab deposited on a periodic 4 × 3 supercell containing a 5-layer (111) CeO2 slab with a 20 Å vacuum in the z-direction to separate the slab perpendicular to the surface (111) Ag-(Co3O4)3-CeO2. The convergence tolerances of energy, maximum force, and displacement were set to 1.0 × 10 − 5 Ha, 0.002 Ha▪Å−1, and 0.005 Å, respectively, and a basis set cut-off of 4.4 Å was employed to ensure high-quality computational results. The reciprocal space was sampled using a 5 × 5 × 1 k-point grid for the geometry optimizations with the bottom two layers fixed in their bulk positions, while a 12 × 12 × 1 grid was used for the electronic structure computations [31]. The charge transfer and the magnetic moment were determined according to the Hirshfeld method. The adsorption energies (Eads) were calculated according to the following equation [32]: E a d s = E a d s o r b a t e / s u b s t r a t e − E a d s o r b a t e − E s u b s t r a t e Eadsorbate/substrate is the total energy of the adsorbate-substrate system in the equilibrium state. Eadsorbate and Esubstrate are the total energy of the free adsorbate and substrate, including hydrocarbon, metal-oxide slab and H atom, respectively. All thermodynamic properties were calculated the following equation [32]: Δ G = Δ E + Δ Z P E − T Δ S Where Δ E is the reaction energy change based on the total energies from DFT calculations, Δ Z P E is the variation in zero point energies (ZPE) and Δ S is the change in entropy before and after the reaction. T is temperature and equals to 298 K. The standard entropy values were cited from reference [24]. Free energy change of each elementary step at external potential U (RHE) will be shifted by n e U as follow [32]: Δ G n ( U ) = Δ G n ( U = 0 ) + n e U Where e is the electronic charge and n is the number of electrons transferred relative to CO2. U is applied potential."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Physical characterization,"3.1 Physical characterization The elemental information of the synthesized samples were analyzed by XRF (Table S1), which results showed these materials were composed of Ag, Co, Ce, O and C. The as prepared LGC showed low crystallinity with a broad peak at approximately 25.7° base on XRD results (Fig. 1 ), which was attributed to (002) plane of graphite carbon [30,33]. The diffraction peaks at 28.5°, 33.1°, 47.5° and 56.3° correspond to the crystal orientations of (111), (200), (220) and (311) of CeO2 (JCPDS NO. 43-1002) [30], and the diffraction peaks at 31.2° and 34.4° indicated the reflections of (220) and (311) plane of Co3O4 (spinel type of cubic crystal) (JCPDS NO. 43-1003) [34]. Moreover, the main four sharp diffractions at approximately 38.1°, 44.3°, 64.4° and 77.2° were consistent with Ag (face-centered-cubic structure) (JCPDS NO. 04-0783) [35]. All the diffraction peaks attributed to Ag, Co3O4 and CeO2 can be observed in Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC, and the crystalline size was calculated, based on the Scherrer equation (Table S2). The results displayed that the crystalline size of Ag, Co3O4 and CeO2 in Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC was smaller than that of Ag/LGC, Co3O4/LGC, CeO2/LGC, etc., which indicated that the co-existence of Ag and Co3O4 could induce the decrease of the CeO2 crystalline size and Ag, Co3O4 as well as CeO2 persisted in Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC as separate crystals rather than doped crystal. The microscopic morphology and structure of Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC was observed by SEM, TEM and elemental mapping images (Fig. 2 ). Abundant pores structure with particles size of 2–50 nm can be observed in SEM image (Fig. 2a). In Fig. 2b–d, it showed that there was the organization of Ag surrounded by Co3O4 on the CeO2 platform, which the lattice spacing of CeO2 (111), Ag (111) and Co3O4 (220) were ∼0.31 nm, ∼0.23 nm and ∼0.28 nm, respectively. Moreover, EDS mapping analysis in Fig. 2e–g further indicated that the catalyst surface was decorated by a nanocomposite of Ag, Co, Ce, O and C, that was CeO2 spread almost as a continues matrix on LGC with Co3O4 surrounded “Ag island” dotted on it. The arrangement of Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC resulted in the strong metal-metal oxide interactions, as revealed by XPS characterization (Figs. 3 and S2). The full survey of Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC composite displays the signals of Ag 3d, Co 2p, Ce 3d, O 1s and C 1s, respectively (Fig. S2A). The C 1S spectra in Fig. S2B exhibited three distinct binding energy peaks at 284.38 eV, 285.13 eV and 288.50 eV, which were attributed to CC, CO and CO bands, respectively [23], according to a relative content of 80%, 15% and 5%, indicated the smaller amount oxidation of carbon after introducing metal oxide onto it. Fig. S3C displayed the high resolution Ag XPS spectrum of Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC, where the peaks at 368.19 eV and 374.13 eV, 367.06 eV can be assigned to metal Ag0 and Ag+ (AgO), respectively [21]. In Fig. S2D, the peaks at 795.3 and 780.6 eV belong to Co2+, while the peaks at binding energies of 796.8 and 782.5 eV are ascribed to Co3+ [36]. It can be seen that the Co3+/Co2+ ratio of Co3O4-CeO2/LGC is slightly higher than that of Co3O4/LGC. However, the Co3+/Co2+ ratio increases from 1.69 in Co3O4-CeO2/LGC to 2.07 in Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC, indicated the formation of spinel structure (AB2O4) of Co3O4, where Co3+ ions fill one-half of the octahedral B sites while Co2+ ions occupy the tetrahedral A sites. Co3+ (t6 2ge0g) is substitutionally inert and low spin because of the higher oxidations state, whereas Co2+ (t5 2ge2g) with a high-spin ion is substitutionally labile [33]. Generally, Co3+ ions with the exposed active sites on Co3O4 play a critical role in the electrocatalytic performance for CO2ER [1,37]. These peaks characteristic of Ce 3d3/2 and Ce 3d5/2 of the Ce oxidation state were as shown in Fig. S2E, which were attributed to Ce3+ and Ce4+ [36]. The peaks at 916.76 eV, 907.4 eV, 901.02 eV, 898.4 eV, 888.80 eV, 888.80 eV and 882.54 eV are attributed to Ce4+, whereas the peaks at 885.08 eV and 903.7 eV are assigned to Ce3+. And the Ce4+/Ce3+ ratio decreased from 2.1 in CeO2/LGC to 0.6 in Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC, indicating an obvious 90% increase of Ce3+ on this catalyst composite surface. The O 1s spectra in Fig. S2F can be decomposed into three binding energy peaks at about 530.1 eV, 531.7 eV and 533.2 eV indicative of the surface lattice oxygen (Olatt) species, graphene oxide oxygen species (OC–O) and the surface-chemisorbed oxygen (Oads) species (e.g. O2−, O− or OH−), respectively [38,39]. Based on the XPS analysis (Fig. 3), the surface elemental composition, chemical state and quantitative results of different compositions have been summarized and listed in Table 1 . Moreover, the Olatt concentration of Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC was much less than the sum of the Olatt concentration of Co3O4/LGC, CeO2/LGC and Ag/LGC. Obviously, this result revealed that the addition of Ag and Co3O4 into CeO2/LGC could induce the removal lattice oxygen of CeO2 to form oxygen vacancy [40]."
8,Electrochemical reduction of CO2,"3.2 Electrochemical reduction of CO2 The LSV of CO2ER performance with a scan rate of 50 mV/s on different catalysts in CO2-saturated KHCO3 solution (0.1 M) were shown in Fig. 4 a. The pure LGC, as the blank sample, exhibited a very low CO2ER activity because of lack the active site. By contrast, after introducing the metal or oxides species on LGC surface, the current density of CeO2/LGC, Co3O4/LGC and Ag/LGC was improved effectively. Moreover, the LSV curve of Co3O4-CeO2/LGC composite presented more positive onset potential (−0.51 V vs. RHE) and larger current, indicating that the incorporation of CeO2 and Co3O4 could effectively increase the CO2ER activity. And the onset potential of Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC composite was −0.36 V vs. RHE, which was more positive onset potential and higher current density than those of Co3O4-CeO2/LGC (−0.51 V vs. RHE) and Ag-CeO2/LGC (-0.71 V vs. RHE). The electrochemical active surface areas (SE) was 23.1 cm2▪mg−1 with Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC loading amount of 0.9 mg▪cm−2 on electrode (Fig. 4b), which was much greater than that of LGC, CeO2/LGC, Co3O4/LGC, Co3O4-CeO2/LGC, Ag/LGC and Ag-CeO2/LGC. Based on XPS and LSV results, it demonstrated that the high oxygen vacancy concentration can effectively reduce the overpotential of CO2ER. The FE for different CO2ER products and CO2 conversion under various potentials were presented in Fig. 5 a, which were obtained from the CO2ER for 2 h on Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC electrode. The Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC electrode can preferentially convert CO2 to liquid products, such as formate, methanol and ethanol. At −0.75 ∼ −0.95 V, Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC exhibited high selectivity for lower alcohols with FE exceeding 43.3% ∼ 77.6%. Importantly, the highest FE of lower alcohols was 77.6% (methanol = 23.4%, ethanol = 54.2%) with current density 12.8 mA·cm−2 under −0.85 V, which was much higher than those of reported in the literature [41–47] (Fig. 6 ). Generally, the selectivity for methanol and ethanol needed a higher degree surface-bound of *CO and *CHO, which were the key step in the formation of lower alcohols [21]. For comparison, the FEs on CeO2/LGC, Co3O4/LGC, Ag/LGC, Co3O4-CeO2/LGC and Ag-CeO2-LGC were given, respectively (Fig. 4b–f). For the CeO2/LGC and Ag/LGC electrodes, no methanol and ethanol were detected. When Co3O4/LGC was used as the working electrode, it presented a little methanol with the highest FE of 5.3% at −1.05 V. As shown in Fig. 5e–f, the highest total FE for methanol and ethanol on Co3O4-CeO2/LGC (17.5%, under −0.85 V) and Ag-CeO2/LGC (12.8%, under −1.05 V) was less than on Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC electrode (77.6%, under −0.85 V). Moreover, the maximal CO2 conversion on Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC electrode (34.5%) at −0.85 V was 1.6 ∼ 4.3 times greater than CeO2/LGC (8% at −1.15 V), Co3O4/LGC (14.8% at −0.75 V), Ag/LGC (17.7% at −0.85 V), Co3O4-CeO2/LGC (21.3% at −0.85 V) and Ag-CeO2/LGC (19.4% at −0.85 V) electrodes. Combined with LSV and FE results, it demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy could promote the conversion of CO2, and the formation of low carbon alcohols was related to the presence of Ag island in Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC. The flow cell reactor test of CO2ER over Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC electrode was evaluated by controlled potential electrolysis at −0.85 V vs. RHE for 60 h with steady CO2 flow (10 ml▪min−1) (Fig. 7 ). Specially, the total FE of ethanol and methanol was maintained at ∼77.6%, operating at an average current density of 12.8 mA▪cm−2 with only slight attenuation during 60 h. This result demonstrated that the Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC catalyst possessed a satisfactory stability for CO2ER to ethanol and methanol under this condition."
9,Mechanism analysis,"3.3 Mechanism analysis To demonstrate the dynamic behavior, Tafel plots for CO2ER on different catalysts electrodes were measured as shown in Fig. 7. The Tafel slopes for CO2ER on CeO2/LGC, Co3O4/LGC, Ag/LGC, Co3O4-CeO2/LGC and Ag-CeO2/LGC were 174, 138, 146, 116 and 124 mV•dec−1, respectively, which were close to the value of 118 mV•dec−1 at low overpotential range, pointed out that CO2 reduction mechanism on these electrodes proceeded through an initial rate determining step that one electron transferred to form a surface-absorbed *CO2 δ− species [48,49]. However, on Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC, the Tafel slopes was 78 mV•dec−1, which was close to the value of 59 mV•dec−1, indicating that multi-electron transfer to CO2 was the rate determining step [50]. In this case, the high concentration of oxygen vacancy may act as the potential active sites for efficiently adsorbing CO2, hence fulfilling the prerequisite to perform the required reduction reactions [4,51]. Moreover, as depicted by the DFT calculation in Fig. 8 a and b, it can clearly be seen that the *CO2 δ − binding on (Co3O4)3-CeO2, Ag-CeO2 and Ag-(Co3O4)3/CeO2 with oxygen vacancy exhibited a remarkably higher partial density of states (PDOS) at the conduction band edges than CeO2, Co3O4 and Ag without oxygen vacancy. In addition, the PDOS of Ag-(Co3O4)3/CeO2 around the conduction band edge was increased noticeably and more dispersive than (Co3O4)3-CeO2 and Ag-CeO2 (Fig. 8a and b). Furthermore, the adsorption free energy of *CO2 δ − absorbed on Ag-(Co3O4)3/CeO2 (0.24 eV) was smaller than that on CeO2 (1.12 eV), Co3O4 (0.92 eV), Ag (0.83 eV), (Co3O4)3/CeO2 (0.75 eV) and Ag/CeO2 (0.71 eV). The result should be beneficial for faster carrier transport to participate the CO2 reduction reactions along the Ce→Co→Ag conducting channels. In addition, the quick electron transport along the channels allowed for low corrosion rates and hence guarantees long-term durability in the aqueous electrolyte. During the whole process of CO2ER in aqueous solution, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) should be considered because it can compete with CO2ER, which will greatly affect the FE of lower alcohols. The weak or strong adsorption of *H+ on the catalyst surface will inhibit CO2ER. Only when the adsorption is moderate, it can promote the hydrogenation of CO2 to form hydrocarbons [21]. We further calculated the free energies and the PDOS of *H+ on all catalysts surface (Fig. 9 ). The H*Ag-(Co3O4)3/CeO2 exhibited a remarkably lower partial density of states (PDOS) near the Fermi energy level than other catalysts, and the more moderate potential barrier for *H+ absorbed on Ag-(Co3O4)3/CeO2 (0.51 eV) than that on CeO2 (1.14 eV), Co3O4 (0.14 eV), Ag (1.14 eV), (Co3O4)3/CeO2 (0.37 eV) and Ag/CeO2 (1.01 eV). In addition, it was noted that the required energy to the adsorption of *H+ species on Ag-(Co3O4)3/CeO2 (0.51 eV) was much higher than those of *CO2 δ − (0.24 eV), which indicated that the CO2ER was more likely to occur than HER on Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC electrode. After understanding the electronic properties of catalysts, we further studied the CO2ER pathways on their surfaces. In Fig. 10 , we plotted the free energy diagrams of CO2ER into methanol and ethanol on different catalysts under -0.85 V (RHE). Two key energy barriers along the overall CO2ER pathway were observed (CO2 → *COOH and *CO δ − → CHO*CHO*), which were in good agreement with previous theoretical studies [52]. In the process of CO2 → *COOH, the energy barrier of the transition state (CO2 → *CO2 δ −) formation was the rate-determining step (Fig. 8c) on CeO2, Co3O4, Ag, Ag/CeO2 and Co3O4/CeO2 composite catalysts. After the initial formation of *CO2 δ −, there was subsequent hydrogenation to *COOH, HCOOH* or *CO δ −, and the HCOOH* was reduced to CH3OH and H2O as well as the *CO δ − was reduced to CH3CH2OH. During the CO2ER to CH3CH2OH, the key step was CC bond-making at low overpotential through a *CO δ − dimerization step mediated by electron transfer rendering a *C2H2O2 2- intermediate [53]. The energy barriers for *CO δ − → CHO*CHO* on CeO2, Co3O4, Ag, Ag/CeO2, and Co3O4/CeO2 composite catalysts were 1.01 eV, 0.81 eV, 0.67 eV, 0.62 eV and 0.70 eV, respectively, which were smaller than their energy barriers for CO2 →*CO2 δ − (1.12, 0.92, 0.83, 0.75 and 0.72 eV). However, it was important to note that the free energy of *CO δ − → CHO*CHO* (0.56 eV) was higher than that of CO2 →*CO2 δ − (0.24 eV) on Ag-Co3O4/CeO2, which indicated that the process of multi-electron transfer on Ag-Co3O4/CeO2 was the determining step rather than one electron transfer (CO2 → *CO2 δ −) on CeO2, Co3O4, Ag, Ag/CeO2 and Co3O4/CeO2, consistenting with experimental studies (Fig. 7). As stated above, this result could be owing to the relatively strong ability of Ag atom in Ag-Co3O4/CeO2 to bind *CO δ −, which led to two phenomena: (i) in lower potential ranges (>−0.56 eV), *CO δ − can desorb from the Ag atom surface to produce CO(g) by just overcoming the *CO δ − → CO(g) barrier; (ii) when an external potential (<−0.56 eV) was applied, *CO δ − was reduced to *CHO, then CC coupling could take place after two *CHO were adsorbed side by side to form *OCHCHO* [54]. To verify the *CO- dimerization step, the electrochemical performances for CO electrochemical reduction over Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC electrode were evaluated at −0.85 V (vs. RHE) in CO-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 (as showed in Figs. S10–12). From 1H-NMR spectra of the liquid products of CO electrochemical reduction (Fig. S13), only CH3CH2OH was detected without CH3OH. However, Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC exhibited the low FE for CH3CH2OH of 9.6%∼26.3% at −0.35 ∼ −1.05 V, and the FE for H2 of 91%∼73%, which can be attributed to the fact that it is more favorable for HER on Co atoms of Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC. Morevoer, it further verified that the key step was CC bond-making at low overpotential through a *CO- dimerization step mediated by electron transfer rendering a *C2H2O2 2- intermediate during the CO2ER to CH3CH2OH. The reaction mechanism for the CO2ER to methanol and ethanol on Ag-Co3O4/CeO2 composite electrode was shown in Fig. 11 . (1) CO2ER to methanol: Stages 1 → 2, one CO2 molecule adsorbs on Ce atom near the oxygen vacancy, while one electron is transferred to CO2 molecule to form *CO2 δ −. Stages 2 → 3, CO2 molecule adsorbed on Ce atom spillovers to near the Co atom, while one proton reduce *CO2 δ − molecule to COOH* on Co atom. Stages 3 → 4, one proton and one electron reduce COOH* to HCOOH*. Stages 4 → 5, one proton and one electron reduce HCOOH* to H2COOH*. Stages 5 → 6, three protons and three electrons reduce H2COOH* to CH3OH, while one CH3OH molecule and two H2O molecules desorb from Co atom surface. (2) CO2ER to ethanol: Stages 1 → 2 and Stages 2 → 3 are same as the process of CO2ER to methanol. Stages 3 → 4, one proton and one electron reduce COOH* to *CO δ − on Co atom surface, while *CO δ − spillovers to the Ag atom surface and one H2O molecule desorbs from Co atom surface. Stages 4 → 5, one proton and one electron reduce *CO δ − to *CHO on Ag atom surface. Stages 5 → 6, two *CHO are dimerized by CC coupling reaction on Ag atom surface to form *OCHCHO*. Stages 6 → 11, eight proton and eight electron reduce *OCHCHO* to CH3CH2OH on Ag atom surface. (Fig. 12 )."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, we have synthesized Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC composite catalyst with multi-active sites by introducing transition metals and their oxides (Ag, Co & Ce) on the surface of low graphitized carbon (LGC) to control the electronic structure of the catalyst surface. Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC displayed a large number of porous structures, a large number of Ag, Co3O4 and CeO2 nanoparticles anchored on LGC, as well as a large number of surface oxygen vacancy. Ag-Co3O4-CeO2/LGC exhibited a good catalyst to promote CO2ER into methanol and ethanol with fast kinetics at low overpotential and good durability (60 h), where the maximum FE of total lower alcohols was 77.6% (methanol 23.4%, ethanol 54.2%) under -0.85 V (vs. RHE). In addition, a combination of experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the multi-active sites of Ag and the surface oxygen vacancy of CeO2 exhibited the high catalytic activity for CO2ER into lower alcohols, which possessed the strong adsorption of *CO2 δ − and intermediate species (*CO δ − and *CHO) and the moderate *H+ adsorption on the Ce atom surface near the oxygen vacancy helping to inhibit HER and promoting CO2ER. *CO2 δ − was reduced to *COOH on Co3+ surface and then *COOH was gradually reduced to methanol, while *COOH was further reduced to ethanol on Ag island. In brief, this study may further provide new opportunities for designing catalysts with highly efficient and low overpotential driven CO2ER to lower alcohols."
