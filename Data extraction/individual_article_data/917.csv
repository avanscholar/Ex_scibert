0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an important energy carrier whose combustion produces only water, thus resulting in a clean and non-polluting energy process. Nevertheless, molecular hydrogen does not naturally exist on the earth, the method of its obtaining thus influencing the sustainability of the whole process. Various photocatalysts have been developed during the last decades to produce H2. The ideal process is to obtain H2 through water splitting (WS), but the efficiency remains quite low. The addition of sacrificial organic reagents, leads to an improvement in hydrogen production through the so-called photo-reforming process [1–6]. The development of this technology could offer a route to H2 that, unlike thermal reforming or gasification, may be exploited under ambient conditions and using sunlight. The efficiency of the traditional photocatalysts, such as TiO2, is increased with the addition of small amounts of metals [1,7–11]. The role of the metal is still a matter of debate. Some authors support the theory that it facilitates the transfer of electrons once generated at the semiconductor [10,12,13]. An additional factor to consider is the different rates on hydrogen production and byproducts obtained depending on the molecules used as sacrificial agent [13–15]. Therefore, focusing on alcohols, ethanol, for instance, produces methane, as well as CO2 and H2, while butan-1-ol gives propane [2]. On the other hand, some polyols produce only CO2 and hydrogen, glycerol having been described as one of those alcohols exhibiting the highest production rates [1,2,16] combined with 100% atom efficiency to H2 [17,18]. Some reports show that for the same number of carbon atoms, the hydrogen production rate depends on the number of hydroxyl groups, following the order glycerol> 1,2-propanediol> propanols [2,19]. Somehow it can be related to the byproducts generated during the reaction, since they can block the metallic particles or the oxidation sites in the semiconductor. The aim of the present work is to compare the hydrogen production from two C-3 chain alcohols (glycerol and propan-2-ol) on several M/TiO2 solids. The effect of the metal of choice (Pt, Pd and Au), the loading and the dispersion on catalytic performance were studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of the different titania-based systems,"2.1 Synthesis of the different titania-based systems All metal-containing solids were synthesized using Degussa-Evonik P25 TiO2 as the support. The general method of incorporation of the metals was deposition-precipitation [20] though for comparative purposes, two Pt-containing solids were also synthesized through impregnation (IMP) and photodeposition (PDEP) methods. 2.1.1 Deposition precipitation method Gold was incorporated onto TiO2 by deposition–precipitation method, the nominal weight being 0.5, 1.5 and 3.0%. The precipitation was carried out in a “Contalab” system (Switzerland) enabling careful control of all the variables, i.e. pH, temperature, stirrer speed, reactant feed flow, etc. “Analytical grade” chemicals were used. First 7g TiO2 were dispersed in 150mL distilled water by ultrasounds. Temperature was increased up to 60°C, stirring rate fixed at 150rpm and pH set at 6.8 which was maintained throughout the whole process by using a 0.2MK2CO3 aqueous solution. Next, a 2gL−1 gold aqueous solution (prepared from HAuCl4·H2O) was dropwise added and the mixture aged 1h at 60°C. The obtained solid was filtered and washed with distilled water until negative chlorine test (AgNO3). Then, the solid was dried at 110°C overnight. Finally, systems were calcined at 400°C for 2h (ramp rate 4°Cmin−1). The synthesis of platinum and palladium based solids was analogous to that described for gold but using a Syrris Atlas system to control all variables. The precursors were H2PtCl6 (8% weight) and PdCl2 from Sigma-Aldrich. 2.1.2 Impregnation method 3g of TiO2 were dispersed in 40mL distilled water containing the required amount of H2PtCl6 aqueous solution (8% by weight) as to have a platinum nominal content of 0.5% by weight. The suspension was stirred during 12h and then vacuum filtered at 100°C. The solid was washed with distilled water until negative chlorine test (AgNO3), dried overnight (100°C) and calcined at 400°C for 2h. 2.1.3 Photodeposition method A Pt/TiO2 solid containing a nominal weight of 0.5% was synthesized using the method described by Maicu et al. [21]. Therefore, TiO2 was dispersed in a 10:1 (distilled water: propan-2-ol) solution containing the precursor (H2PtCl6, Sigma Aldrich). Photodeposition was carried out under N2 atmosphere exposing the mixture to UV light from 8 15W Philips-Cleo compact lamps (λ max=355nm). The solid was then filtered and washed with distilled water until negative chlorine test (AgNO3), dried overnight (100°C) and calcined at 400°C for 2h. Catalyst nomenclature includes the metal (Pt, Pd or Au), the nominal content (0.5, 1.5 or 3% by weight) and a suffix indicating the synthetic method (DP, IMP or PDEP for deposition-precipitation, impregnation or photodeposition, respectively)."
3,Characterization of the solids,"2.2 Characterization of the solids Elemental analysis of metal-containing samples was carried out by the staff at the Central Service for Research Support (SCAI) of the University of Córdoba. It was performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Measurements were made on a Perkin-Elmer ELAN DRC-e instrument following dissolution of the sample. Digestion of the samples consisted in a two-step treatment with a 1:1:1H2O/H2SO4/HF solution at 80°C and a 1:3 HNO3/HCl mixture. EDX measurements were performed at the Central Service for Research Support (SCAI) of the University of Córdoba on a JEOL JSM-6300 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector. It was operated at an acceleration voltage of 20keV with a resolution of 65eV. Surface areas of the solids were determined from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms obtained at liquid nitrogen temperature on a Micromeritics ASAP-2010 instrument, using the Brunnauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. All samples were degassed to 0.1Pa at 120°C prior to measurement. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained at the Central Service for Research Support (SCAI) of the University of Córdoba using a JEOL JEM 1400 microscope available at SCAI. All samples were mounted on 3mm holey carbon copper grids. Particle sizes were obtained by counting 100 particles. Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra were performed on a Cary 1E (Varian) instrument, using polytetraethylene (density=1gcm−3 and thickness=6mm) as reference material. Band gap values were obtained from the plot of the modified Kubelka–Munk function [F(R)·E]1/2 versus the energy of the absorbed light E. Extrapolation to y=0 of the linear regression in the 3.4–3.7eV range afforded the bandgap value. FT-Raman spectra were obtained on an EZRaman-N-785-B system with a led source (12740cm−1 or 785nm). It was operated at a resolution of 6cm−1 throughout the 3000–100cm−1 range to gather 20 scans. Laser power was set at 300mW. X-ray patterns of the samples were obtained on a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer equipped with a DACO-MP automatic control and data acquisition system. The instrument was equipped with a graphite monochromator and used Cu K α radiation. The diffraction angle was scanned at a rate of 2° min−1 in the 5°–80° (2Θ) range. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were recorded at the Central Service for Research Support (SCAI) of the University of Córdoba on 4mm×4mm pellets 0.5mm thick that were obtained by gently pressing the powdered materials following outgassing to a pressure below about 2×10−8 Torr at 150°C in the instrument pre-chamber to remove chemisorbed volatile species. The main chamber of the Leibold–Heraeus LHS10 spectrometer used, capable of operating down to less than 2×10−9 Torr, was equipped with an EA-200MCD hemispherical electron analyser with a dual X-ray source using AlKα(hν=1486.6eV) at 120W, at 30mA, with C (1s) as energy reference (284.6eV)."
4,Photo-catalytic experiments,"2.3 Photo-catalytic experiments Experimental runs were performed in a Pyrex cylindrical doubled-walled immersion well reactor (23cm long×5cm internal diameter, with a total volume of 190cm3). A medium pressure 125W Hg lamp supplied by Photochemical Reactors Ltd was used as excitation source, with an incident light intensity of ca. 1.2×10−5 Einsteins−1. 85mg of catalyst were added to 85mL of alcohol solution (10% v/v in water, ca. 1.3M). All through the process, Ar was bubbled through the suspension (20 mLmin−1). Outlet gas composition was on-line analyzed by mass spectrometry, H2 (m/z =2) and CO2 (m/z =44) being calibrated using 5%H2 and 5%CO2 in Ar cylinders. When required, those reference gas flows were diluted in Ar. Reaction time was 1000min. Glycerol and propan-2-ol in solution were analyzed by GC-FID (Agilent Technologies 7890 chromatograph using a Supelco 25357 Nukol capillary column 30m long, 0.53mm ID and 1μm film thickness). The catalysts were tested as synthesized."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the solids,"3.1 Characterization of the solids The main features concerning the characterization of the solids are summarized in Table 1 . Elemental composition was determined by ICP-MS and EDX. In all cases platinum incorporation by deposition-precipitation method was better than that of gold. A comparison of incorporation methods for platinum (nominal content of 0.5%) reveals that, as expected, impregnation led to the quantitative incorporation, whereas photodeposition resulted in a lower incorporation than deposition-precipitation method. X-ray diffractograms (Fig. S1) show that TiO2 structure was not modified on the incorporation of the metal. Moreover, the absence of signals corresponding to the metals even at 3% nominal content suggest that they have been incorporated as small, homogeneous nanoparticles [22–26]. As regards the surface area, in all cases BET values are in the 51–57m2 g−1 range which again suggests that titania structure was hardly affected by the metals. Average metal particle size (Table 1) was determined from TEM micrographs (Fig. S2) [27]. Platinum particles in the solids synthesized by deposition-precipitation method exhibited an average diameter of ca. 2nm irrespective of the metal loading. As for gold, slightly bigger particles (ca. 3nm) were obtained whereas the solid containing palladium (0.5% nominal) was preferentially located on some TiO2 particles and exhibited intermediate average particle sizes (ca. 2.4nm). All in all, deposition-precipitation method led to small metal particles in the 2–3nm range for all three metals (Au, Pt and Pd) which is important in order to compare catalytic results. Focusing on platinum solids containing 0.5% nominal by weight, the smallest particle sizes were obtained by impregnation (1.4nm) whereas photodeposition resulted in the biggest particles (4.9nm). In order to determine the oxidation state of the metals, XPS analyses were performed studying Ti2p, O1s, Pt4f, Au4f, Pd3d and C1s signals (Figs. S3 and S4 and Table 1). As regards gold systems, Au (4f7/2) binding energies (Fig. S3A) are in all cases 82.9eV which is a lower value than that described for Au0 (ca. 83.8eV) [28].This suggests the existence of strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) resulting in a partial negative charge transfer from oxygen vacancies in TiO2 to gold [29–32]. For Pd-0.5%DP (Fig. S3B) there are two main signals at Pd 3d5/2 binding energies of 335.0eV and 336.5eV, corresponding to Pd0 and Pd2+, respectively [21,33]. Pd2+ is the major oxidation state for as-synthesized solid, whereas upon reduction at 200°C or 400°C, palladium is mainly as Pd0 (not shown). Fig. S4A shows Pt 4f signal for Pt-3.0%DP and its change upon reduction treatment. As can be seen, Pt2+ (binding energy at ca. 72.2eV [34]) is the main signal for untreated solid (65.9%) whereas upon reduction at 400°C the major signal (73.3%) appeared at ca. 70.7eV, ascribed to Pt0 [35]. An intermediate reduction temperature (200°C) resulted in 57% of platinum as Pt0, while 34.5% remained as Pt2+. Fig. S4 B corresponds to XPS analyses of a Pt-3.0%DP freshly reduced sample and the as synthesized solids used in glycerol or propan-2-ol photo-catalytic transformation. As can be seen, XPS spectra are very similar to that of Pt-3.0%DP sample pre-reduced at 400°C which suggests the in-situ reduction of the solid. This is the reason why the catalysts were tested in the reaction without any pre-reduction treatment. For platinum-containing solids with a low metal loading there is an interference in Pt 4f signal probably corresponding to Al 2p coming from the support (Evonik P25 contains ca. 0.3% Al2O3) or a satellite in titanium [35]. In these cases, Pt 4f signal of pure TiO2 was subtracted to obtain XPS data in Table 1. From that Table it is evident that for Pt-0.5% IMP and Pt-0.5% DP the main signal corresponded to Pt2+ whereas, as expected, photodeposition resulted in Pt0. As far as Ti 2p3/2 signal is concerned, singlets with binding energies of ca. 458.6eV were obtained in all cases, associated to Ti4+ [34]. In the case of O 1s, the main signal appeared at ca. 529.9eV associated to O2− [36]. UV–vis DRIFT spectra of the solids are depicted in Fig. S5 and the corresponding band gap values are given in Table 1. Modification of Evonik P25 with Pt, Pd or Au resulted in the extension of light absorption to the visible (400–700nm). Since the synthetic method started from Evonik TiO2 it is highly improbable that the metals entered TiO2 lattice. Instead, absorption of Pt-TiO2 solids in the visible could be ascribed to the presence of PtO on the TiO2 surface [37]. An additional factor which could explain the absorption of metals in the visible is the so-called localized plasmon resonance (LSPR), due to collective oscillation of free conduction band electrons of the metal particles in response to optical excitation. In the case of Pd and Pt, LSPR band is hardly seen in the visible region, because of a damping effect caused by d–d interband transitions whereas it is clearly evident for gold [16]. There are several factors affecting the position and intensity of plasmon absorbance such as metal particle size, shape, content and the surrounding environment. In any case, the observed band at ca. 550–560nm in Au-0.5% DP (Fig. S5) is consistent with values described in the literature for Au/TiO2 solids with similar gold particle sizes (ca. 3nm) [38]. Raman spectra of the solids are given in Fig. S6. For Evonik TiO2, there are some anatase signals at Raman Shift values of 146, 200, 398, 518 and 638cm−1 which are assigned to Eg(1), Eg(2), B1g, A1g+B1g and Eg(3) modes, respectively [39]. In the case of the solids synthesized through deposition-precipitation method, irrespective of the metal, signal at 145cm−1 for TiO2 is shifted to higher wavenumbers. This could be ascribed to the presence of surface oxygen vacancies [40,41]."
7,Hydrogen photo-production from alcohols,"3.2 Hydrogen photo-production from alcohols Fig. 1 shows the typical reaction profile for glycerol (Fig. 1A) and propan-2-ol (Fig. 1B) photocatalytic transformation on the example of Au-0.5%DP catalyst. As regards glycerol, hydrogen production rate reaches a maximum after which it decreases and stabilizes. This is consistent with those results described in the literature for alcohol photo-reforming [17]. In the case of glycerol, pure photo-reforming stoichiometry can be described as: (1) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H 2 O → 3 C O 2 + 7 H 2 and for propan-2-ol: (2) C 3 H 8 O + 5 H 2 O → 3 C O 2 + 9 H 2 As can be seen, H2/CO2 ratio for glycerol at the steady state does not differ much from the value of Eq. (1). On the contrary, H2 evolution for propan-2-ol transformation is more stable and CO2 is hardly detected. In fact, the main reaction products, as confirmed by GC-FID and MS, are acetone and hydrogen. In this case, the process can be described as photo-dehydrogenation (since in fact there is no reaction in the absence of light under our experimental conditions, i.e. 10°C). (3) C 3 H 8 O → C 3 H 6 O + H 2 Similar profiles for glycerol and propan-2-ol transformation are observed on all metal-containing solids synthesized in the present work. Figs. 2 and 3 summarize the results obtained for hydrogen production using both substrates as sacrificial agents, expressed as mmol H2 gcat −1 h−1 (A) or TOF (moles H2 produced per·mole surface metal atom per second) (B). Values represented correspond to the stabilized hydrogen rate. Interpretation of results is difficult since there are many factors simultaneously influencing catalytic performance, such as the nature of the metal co-catalyst, loading, particle size and different adsorption of substrates, just to cite some of them. Nevertheless, some comments can be made regarding the effect of those parameters on hydrogen production. A first conclusion from Fig. 2A and Fig. 3A is that there is a clear enhancement of catalytic activity on metal modification of TiO2. Moreover, hydrogen production rate does not increase proportionally with the increase in metal content. This results in TOF values decreasing with the metal content for Pt-DP and Au-DP series. This is consistent with data found in the literature, where different explanations are given. Firstly, for a metal content too high (typically over 0.1–1% depending on the metal) titania surface is excessively covered, so decreasing the absorption of light [42]. According to Bowker et al. [10], there is a requirement for maximizing the active interface between the metal nanoparticles and the photo-active titania which is achieved at low metal loadings. An additional factor to consider is that an excessive amount of noble metals can result in them acting as recombination centers, which is detrimental to activity [42,43]. Focusing on Pt-containing catalysts, for the same nominal content (0.5%), TOF values followed the order Pt-0.5%PDEP>Pt-0.5%-DP>Pt-0.5%IMP (Fig. 2B and Fig. 3B). This suggests that the reaction is structure-sensitive: the higher the average metal particle size (in the 2–5nm range), the higher the activity. This is clearly seen in Fig. 4 . As for the influence of the metal co-catalyst, in the case of glycerol photo-reforming, activity decreased in the order Pt≈Au>Pd whereas for propan-2-ol dehydrogenation, it followed the order Pt>Pd>Au. These results can be explained considering the different nature of the processes. For propan-2-ol transformation, activity is in line with work functions of metals (Pt 5.7eV>Pd 5.6eV>Au 5.3eV) [16,44,45]. In the case of glycerol photo-reforming, a more complex mechanism takes place, involving not only dehydrogenation but also decarbonylation. Therefore, some other factors are probably to account for the observed activity such as the different adsorption and stability of generated poisoning CO and reaction intermediates on the metals [16]. Finally, adsorption of both C-3 substrates (glycerol and propan-2-ol) on Pt-0.5% DP system was studied, using different concentrations in aqueous solutions (from 0.01%v/v to 10%v/v). In both cases, results (Fig. 5 ) can be interpreted in terms of a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model assuming a dissociative adsorption. Therefore, the dependence of photocatalytic reaction rates on substrate concentration could be expressed as: (4) 1 r = 1 k + 1 k × K × C 1 2 Where k is an apparent rate constant and K the equilibrium constant. From the slope and the intercept in Fig. 5 the values of k and K can be determined for both propan-2-ol and glycerol transformation. Therefore, kpropan-2-ol/kglycerol is ca. 370 whereas Kglycerol/Kpropan-2-ol is ca. 68. This suggests that propan-2-ol reacts faster than glycerol (which is evident from Figs. 2 and 3) and that glycerol adsorbs stronger than propan-2-ol. In order to verify this latter conclusion, a competitive reaction was performed on Pt-0.5% DP starting from a 0.1% glycerol/10% propan-2-ol aqueous mixture (Fig. 6 ). As can be seen, initially, the reaction profile is similar to that of glycerol alone, despite its very low concentration in the mixture as compared to propan-2-ol. It is only when most of glycerol has been consumed that propan-2-ol starts to react significantly, as evidenced by the increase in H2 production and the H2/CO2 ratio. An additional experiment starting with a 10% v/v acetone aqueous mixture (not shown) resulted in hydrogen production being 100 times lower than that achieved with propan-2-ol. This is hardly surprising since it is essential for good photo-reforming activity to have an H at the alpha-position to the oxygenate function [10]. Therefore, results shown in the present manuscript evidence the existence of different reaction mechanisms for glycerol and propan-2-ol photocatalytic transformation (photo-reforming and dehydrogenation, respectively). Pt and other noble metals have been described to be excellent catalysts for alcohol activation and oxidation to the corresponding carbonyl compounds [46]. Furthermore, alcohols can dissociatively adsorb (as alkoxides and hydrogen atoms) on the metals [47], which is in line with the observed dissociative adsorption mechanism. For oxidative dehydrogenation, the role of oxygen is oxidation of hydrogen generated on the catalysts and can be substituted by a hydrogen acceptor [48]. What is more, the process has also been described under inert atmosphere though in that case catalyst deactivates quite fast, oxygen being used to oxidize adsorbed species on the catalyst thus cleaning the catalyst surface [49]. In our photocatalytic process, electron-hole generation could favor propan-2-ol dehydrogenation in the absence of oxygen according to: (5) CH3 −CHOH−CH3 →(CH3)2 −CHO(ads) +H(ads) →(CH3)2 −C=O+H2 Having a look at the literature on propan-2-ol photo-reforming, different results can be found. Bahruji et al. [2], for instance, detected CH4, CO2 and H2 as the major products. Fu et al. described complete photoreforming (CO2 and H2) [19], whereas no explicit mention to generated products but to hydrogen production is given in other papers [7,16]. Finally, Shiragami et al. only detected H2 and acetone [14] as it is the case of the present work. The absence of CO2 generation from propan-2-ol could be the result of the substrate-catalyst labile interaction, thus resulting in an easy acetone desorption whereas glycerol, with 3 OH groups, could interact stronger with the catalyst and undergo other processes (e.g. decarbonylation) eventually leading to CO2 and H2. All in all, the highest H2 production rate values obtained in the present study corresponded to the use of propan-2-ol rather than glycerol as the sacrificial agent, despite the H2: substrate ratio being less favorable, 1:1 (propan-2-ol dehydrogenation, Eq. (4)) rather than 7:1 (glycerol photo-reforming, Eq. (2)). The highest TOF value (ca. 5.5s−1) for H2 production was obtained on Pt- 0.5% PDEP via propan-2-ol dehydrogenation."
8,Conclusions,"Different photocatalysts consisting in noble metals (Pt, Pd or Au) supported on TiO2 (metal loadings of 0.5–3%) were synthesized, their metal particle sizes being in the 2–5nm range. XPS and Raman evidenced the existence of some metal-titania interaction, resulting in the transfer of electrons from the semiconductor to the metal. The solid were tested for hydrogen production using glycerol or propan-2-ol as the sacrificial agents. In the former case, photo reforming was observed whereas in the latter there was a selective transformation of propan-2-ol to acetone and molecular hydrogen. For both substrates reactions were structure sensitive with bigger average metal particle sizes (in the 2–5nm range) favoring hydrogen production. Moreover, under the present experimental conditions, the highest TOF values corresponded to the lowest metal content (0.5% nominal by weight). Several factors such as the need for maximizing the active interface between the metal nanoparticles and the photo-active titania or the fact that a low metal content favors electron-hole separation (electron scavenging) whereas higher metal loadings favor the recombination could account for that. As for the influence of the nature of the metal co-catalyst, for propan-2-ol dehydrogenation TOF values followed the work function order (Pt>Pd>Au). On the contrary, glycerol transformation (photo-reforming) is more complex activity order following the sequence Pt≈Au>Pd. Both C3 substrates followed a dissociative adsorption Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism and competitive adsorption experiment evidenced the stronger adsorption of glycerol as compared to propan-2-ol. This could account for the observed different behavior: propan-2-ol adsorbs, produces acetone and desorbs (the activity order being dependent on the dehydrogenation activity of the metal), whereas glycerol adsorbs stronger and undergo different reactions (e.g. dehydrogenation, decarbonylation) eventually leading to CO2 and H2."
