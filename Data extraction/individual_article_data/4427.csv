0,Introduction,"An environmentally attractive approach of biphasic catalysis is the choice of using water as the solvent of the catalyst. In 1973, this alternative approach of biphasic catalysis has been already reported by Manassen [1]. In 1977, based on the ascertainments of Bailar's review [2], Dror and Manassen [3] developed a biphasic catalytic system with organometallic complexes of rhodium–phosphine in aqueous media in order to hydrogenate olefins. In aqueous biphasic catalysis, after the end of the catalytic reaction there is a system with two immiscible phases, the upper organic phase contains the substrate and the products and the lower aqueous phase holds the catalyst. Thus, the heterogenization of a homogeneous catalyst overcame the main weakness of homogeneous catalysis, which is the easy and efficient recovering of the catalyst. The first distinguished and successful industrial application of the aqueous biphasic catalysis is the hydroformylation of propylene in aqueous/organic system to butyraldehyde, identified as Ruhrchemie/Rhone-Poulenc process [4]. Aqueous biphasic catalytic systems have been also used in the hydrogenation of individual aldehydes for the production of the corresponding alcohols. During the last two decades, the use of water-soluble ruthenium complexes instead of rhodium complexes has attracted substantial interest due to the much lower price of ruthenium [5], comparing to rhodium, and the easy detachment of active hydrogenation catalysts from the organic products [6–8]. Furthermore, the appropriate selection of the ligands is the one that specifies the water-solubility of the catalytic system and subsequently, it retains the ruthenium complexes in the aqueous phase. The TPPTS ligand (TPPTS=P[m-C6H4SO3Na]3, trisodium salt of m-trisulfonated triphenyl phosphine) is one of them, due to its high solubility in water (more than 1200gl−1). In spite of the facts that aqueous biphasic catalysis is a relatively newly established section of catalysis, as well as the TPPTS can be easily oxidised by the oxygen of the atmospheric air (OTPPTS=TPPTS oxide) and the chemistry of the ill-defined commercial hydrated ruthenium chloride is extremely complex [9]; Ru/TPPTS complexes have been reported as effective catalytic systems for the hydrogenation of aldehydes. Fache et al. [8] hydrogenate propionaldehyde catalysed by Ru/TPPTS complexes in aqueous media. Then, Grosselin et al. [6] first used the catalytic system RuCl3·xH2O/TPPTS for the hydrogenation of 3-methyl-2-butenal in aqueous biphasic system (water–toluene). The hydrogenation of 3-phenyl-2-propenal [10–12] and 2-butenal [10] catalysed by RuCl3·3H2O/TPPTS complexes has been reported. Moreover, Heinen et al. [13] carried out hydrogenation of fructose with RuCl3·xH2O/TPPTS complex; and Nuithitikul and Winterbottom [14] revealed that Ru/TPPTS catalytic system is not only selective at CO bonds, but also at CC bonds under low concentrations of Ru/TPPTS. In this research work, we study for the first time the aqueous biphasic hydrogenation of a mixture of 2-methylvaleraldehyde, 2-ethylbutyraldehyde, hexanal, heptaldehyde, 2-phenylpropionaldehyde and hydrocinnamaldehyde catalysed by Ru/TPPTS complex, which was generated in situ by direct addition of RuCl3·xH2O catalyst precursor to TPPTS. The mixture of the above aldehydes represents a model of hydroformylated naphtha, which was developed considering the products with the highest yield (mol%) of the hydroformylated alkene mixture (present in naphtha) of Baricelli et al. [15,16] and of the hydroformylated LCN (Light Cracked Naphtha) of the research works which were implemented in Kavala Institute of Technology [17,18]. A potential application of aqueous biphasic catalytic hydrogenation in a hydroformylated fuel would increase the concentration of molecular oxygen on it, it would also raise the RON (Research Octane Number) of the fuel [19] and it would improve the storage stability by reducing the conciseness of aldehydes. In addition, the produced long-chain alcohols by the hydrogenation of the corresponding aldehydes would achieve a better solubility in the fuel and probably, it would positively take off the solubility of low-chain alcohols in the fuel. Therefore, aqueous biphasic catalytic hydrogenation of a hydroformylated fuel, a “green” procedure, will be capable to be applied in situ and eventually, upgrading the quality of the ultimate fuel by improving its combustion properties."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and instrumentation,"2.1 Materials and instrumentation 2-Ethylbutyraldehyde, heptaldehyde, 2-phenylpropionaldehyde and hydrocinnamaldehyde were obtained from Aldrich. Hexanal and 2-methylvaleraldehyde were purchased from Merck and Alfa Aesar, respectively. RuCl3·xH2O was purchased from Aldrich and used as catalyst precursor. Toluene extra pure and NaCl were obtained from Merck. Hydrogen 5.0N was obtained from Aeroscopio Hellas and was used in the hydrogenation reactions without further purification. N2, Ar, Zero Air, and He 5.0N were also purchased from Aeroscopio Hellas. TPPTS was prepared in the Industrial Chemistry Laboratory of University of Athens, according to the procedure of Hoechst AG, Werk Ruhrchemie [20], and isolated with purity higher than 99% (31P{1H}NMR (121MHz, 25°C, D2O): δ TPPTS=−5.1ppm). All the reactions were performed in 100ml Autoclave Engineers reactor with a low carbon stainless steel vessel (316LSS). Products were analysed using a Perkin Elmer 8700 gas chromatograph (GC) with a flame ionization detector (FID) employing a Petrocol DH 150 capillary column (150m length, 0.25mm diameter, 1.0μm film). Column temperature was kept initially constant at 40°C for 5min, then it was raised to 200°C at a rate of 2°Cmin−1 and remained there for 45min. Helium (99.999%) was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate 20cm/s at 175°C and 65psig. In order to clean the column from various remaining redundant compounds the oven temperature kept at 230°C for 180min (the temperature of both the injector and detector was 280°C) prior to analysis."
3,Analytical method,"2.2 Analytical method The method of gas chromatography with FID was used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the hydrogenation products. In the qualitative analysis of the products we used standard alcohols to identify the reported peaks from the GC. The gas chromatographs of 2-ethyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-pentanol, hexyl alcohol, heptyl alcohol from ChemServices, 2-phenyl-1-propanol from Aldrich and 3-phenyl-1-propanol from Alfa Aesar were used for the identification of the hydrogenation products. On the other hand, a special calibration-estimation procedure was used for the quantitative analysis of the compounds, which is recommended by the technical manual of Perkin Elmer-Model 8700 GC/FID (without automatic sampler), in order to verify the linearity of GC/FID and reduce the standard error of the analysis. Occasionally, the FID is not linear in the whole area of the GC analysis and especially, in cases there are different homologous series [21]. The above calibration-estimation procedure proved that the FID for the specific area of analysis behaves linearly. Therefore, it was efficiently achieved not only the counterbalance of the standard error of the analysis and the adaptation of the experimental computations to the specific GC/FID device; but also the linear behaviour of the FID in the examined experimental area was proved."
4,Hydrogenation procedure,"2.3 Hydrogenation procedure The hydrogenation reactions as well as the analysis of the products were carried out in the Petroleum Chemistry & Technology and the N. Gas Chemistry & Technology (Computational Metrological Analysis & Management) Labs of the Dept. of Petroleum & N. Gas Technology, of Kavala Institute of Technology. In the beginning of the experimental procedure, deoxygenation of distilled demineralised water was occurred via an ultrasonic cleaning bath under high vacuum for 3h prior to use. Parallel to the preceding procedure, which was repeated several times, a pot with the substrate (2-methylvaleraldehyde, 2-ethylbutyraldehyde, hexanal, heptaldehyde, 2-phenylpropionaldehyde and hydrocinnamaldehyde in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 molar ratio) was stirred in ambient temperature for the same time in order to achieve better homogenization of the aldehydes mixture. All manipulations and reactions were performed under an argon or nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques [22]. The Ru–TPPTS catalyst used was prepared in situ by direct addition of RuCl3 to TPPTS in aqueous solutions. Thus, in a typical experiment, an aqueous solution of the RuCl3·xH2O catalyst precursor (11.7mg; 0.04mmol) and TPPTS ligand (110mg; 0.18mmol) in water (15ml) together with a 1:1:1:1:1:1 mixture of the six aldehydes (6ml; 44.21mmol) in toluene (9ml) were fed in the stainless steel autoclave reactor which was equipped with an electromagnetic agitation system, a cooling–heating system, a central control unit (CT-1000) and a sampling valve. The reactor was then purged with nitrogen three times followed by flushing hydrogen also three times at room temperature. Afterwards, hydrogen pressurization and heating were carried out according to the desired reaction pressure and temperature. The temperature set points, the dwell time and the agitation speed were monitored and controlled by the indicators and controllers of the central control unit. Zero time of the reaction was taken when the temperature inside the autoclave reached the preferred value; due to the fact that aldehydes conversion was not higher than 5% when the desired temperature was achieved [7]. At the end of the run the autoclave vessel was rapidly cooled in ice, the stirring was stopped and the reactor was vented before opening it [23,24]. A separation funnel was used to divide the withdrawn reaction mixture into two phases. Immediately, the organic layer was analysed by gas chromatography [25]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Aqueous biphasic hydrogenation of a hydroformylated naphtha model,"3.1 Aqueous biphasic hydrogenation of a hydroformylated naphtha model A successful chemical model [15,16,24,25] depends on the appropriate selection and ratio of its components. In this research work a model of hydroformylated naphtha was developed considering a combination of the products with the highest yield (mol%) of the hydroformylated alkene mixture (present in naphtha) of Baricelli et al. [15,16] and of hydroformylated LCN of the research works [17,18], especially the experiments encoded O/1 (conversion 72%) and L/3 (conversion 60%) [17], which were implemented in Kavala Institute of Technology. In the whole range of experiments, the model of hydroformylated naphtha consists of 2-methylvaleraldehyde, 2-ethylbutyraldehyde, hexanal, heptaldehyde, 2-phenylpropionaldehyde and hydrocinnamaldehyde in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 molar ratio. The above mixture of aldehydes (6ml) composes the substrate of the hydrogenation reactions. The 1:1:1:1:1:1 molar ratio was chosen for the sake of simplicity; due to the fact that the molar ratio of naphtha components varies from region to region. Toluene (9ml) was used in the majority of the experiments as the organic solvent and together with the substrate composes the organic phase of the biphasic catalytic system. Toluene is a suitable organic solvent for aqueous biphasic systems, because of its solubility gap with water [26], which makes easier the final separation of the two phases without the use of phase-transfer agents or additional cosolvent [6]. Moreover, toluene is a quite stable solvent and it achieves rapid hydrogenation rate without being hydrogenated itself under particular conditions [27]. On the other hand, TPPTS is a wide used water-soluble ligand [28], which was prepared in 1974 by modification of TPPMS synthesis [29] (TPPMS=(3-sulfonatophenyl) diphenyl phosphine sodium salt) and then, it was extensively used in combination with ruthenium metal centre in many hydrogenation reactions in aqueous media [6,8,10–14]. Scheme 1 illustrates the three-step preparation procedure of TPPTS (trisulfonation of triphenyl phosphine, hydrolysis of the mixture and the formation of the final product of the meta-sodium salt) [20]. Thus, the redox reaction between RuCl3 and TPPTS in water–toluene biphasic system generates in situ [30,31], and without any pH control [6,14], the catalytic complex HRuCl(TPPTS)3, which is one of the most efficient catalysts (Scheme 2 ) of homogeneous hydrogenation of aldehydes [10,14,32]. Further addition of hydrogen and TPPTS generates a more efficient catalyst complex H2Ru(TPPTS)4 [6,14,30,31,33]. Eventually, the whole catalytic system tends to equilibrium between mono- and bi-hydrides (Scheme 3 ) [6,10,14,30,31]. In similar water-soluble Ru species, such as HRuCl(TPPMS)3 and H2Ru(TPPMS)4 [30,31,33], Joó et al. [30,31] mentioned that the equilibrium between the above two Ru species could be shifted as a function of pH value. Specifically, it was found that at pH 3.3 the dominant complex was HRuCl(TPPMS)3 while at pH 7 it was H2Ru(TPPMS)4 [30,31]. Consequently, depending on the pH, various Ru–hydrides complexes could be ascertained as active catalytic species [33]. A series of experiments was carried out with pressures between 10bar and 70bar, temperatures in the range of 22–110°C, reaction times between 10min and 300min, TPPTS/Ru molar ratio in the range of 3–6 equivalents TPPTS per atom of ruthenium, substrate/Ru molar ratio between 500 and 2000 per atom of ruthenium, agitation speed in the range of 500–2500rpm and use of different organic solvents. Conversion is given as the mol% ratio of the initial aldehydes of the substrate minus the final aldehydes after the hydrogenation to the initial aldehydes of the substrate, yield as the mol% ratio of produced alcohols to the total aldehydes of the substrate, TON as the mole of alcohols per mole of Ru and TOF as the mole of alcohols per mole of Ru per hour. At the end of all the hydrogenation reactions, the reaction mixture was strictly biphasic [34]. The upper organic layer was colourless [6] and it contained the produced alcohols (2-ethyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, 2-phenyl-1-propanol and 3-phenyl-1-propanol), while the catalyst remained in the yellowish lower aqueous layer [34]."
7,"Effect of reaction pressure, temperature and time","3.2 Effect of reaction pressure, temperature and time Table 1 , Figs. 1 and 2 present the activity of the catalyst in the hydrogenation of a mixture of aldehydes as a function of hydrogen pressure, temperature and time, respectively. According to Table 1, a higher conversion was observed by increasing H2 pressure. The increase in conversion was more profound up to 20bar, but it was also increased, although at a lower rate, above 20bar and up to 70bar. A possible explanation could be that by increasing H2 pressure its dissolution in the liquid phase is also increased. In addition, the increase of hydrogen concentration in the solution favours the creation and further stabilization of RuHCl(TPPTS)3 active catalytic complex [10,14]. It must also be noted that the conversion of the aldehydes and the yield of the alcohols performed an almost identical (parallel) change with the increase of pressure, meaning that any parallel reactions that also took place preserved a steady yield. Moreover, in Fig. 2 is shown that a higher yield was observed by increasing the reaction temperature up to 100°C. For temperatures higher than 100°C it was observed a decrease in the activity of the catalytic system. A particular characteristic observed and written in the research logbook was that after the termination of the reaction of experiments encoded C7/222H (at 120°C) and C8/223H (at 140°C), was a turbid aqueous phase with some distinct black particles and a thin layer in between the two phases. This observation according to Fache et al. [7] and Heinen et al. [13] is due to deactivation and instability of the catalyst system since under these conditions it is favoured the creation of arenes’ complexes of the type [Ru(H)(n6-C6H5CH3)(TPPTS)2]Cl, that they reduce (oppose to) the activity of the catalytic system [10]. In addition, at temperatures higher than 100°C, they are favoured other parallel reactions that finally reduce alcohols’ yield. Therefore, it is revealed that the catalyst is not stable in the presence of hydrogen at temperatures above 100°C. Considering also the fact that the catalytic system can be regarded as a water-soluble analog of Wilkinson's catalyst, which is still active under normal environmental conditions, the reaction was also tested at 22°C. The conversion observed under such mild temperature conditions was just a 1.7%, dictating the mass transfer difficulties normally encountered in most biphasic systems. At this point the issue that comes into question is whether the biphasic hydrogenations of aldehydes under the above conditions are catalysed by single metal homogeneous Ru complexes or by Ru colloids/nanoparticles. Although Besson et al. [35] claimed that it is experimentally difficult to clearly discern whether the catalyst is a truly single metal homogeneous catalyst or consists of soluble metal–nanoparticles; the TEM-EDX measurements of Mahfud et al. [36] implied that the reactions are catalysed by single metal homogeneous Ru complexes. Thus, further experiments outside the scope of this paper with specialised measurements on the aqueous phase after the reaction would be required to reveal the structure of the catalyst system. Based upon the experimental method of Fache et al. [7], the zero time of the reaction (start-up time) was regarded as the time moment where the system reaches the preset temperature (set point) and as the end of the reaction, the moment that the heating was stopped. As it is shown in Fig. 2, 18.9% of the substrate was hydrogenated within the first 10min of the experiments and a very steep increase of both conversion and yield rates was observed within the first 60min of the reaction. For reaction times more than 2h, both conversion and yield seem to be stabilized. The initially high increase and further stabilization of conversion in connection with reaction time is a typical characteristic of most hydrogenation reactions [6–8,12,23], observed also during our experiments with mixture of aldehydes as substrate. Consequently, it appears that the optimal values of hydrogen pressure, temperature and reaction time in respect not only to high conversion and yield of the reaction, but also to the mildest conditions for hydrogenation, were 20bar, 80°C and 120min, correspondingly."
8,Influence of TPPTS/Ru and aldehydes/Ru molar ratios,"3.3 Influence of TPPTS/Ru and aldehydes/Ru molar ratios The water-soluble ligand used in our catalytic system was TPPTS (trisulfonated triphenyl phosphine). Previous research works on the hydrogenation of individual aldehydes using the RuCl3/TPPTS catalyst have revealed that the conversion is a strong function of the ligand to metal ratio [6,10,14]. TPPTS becomes highly soluble to the water phase due to the sulfone groups. According to Grosselin et al. [6], trisulfonate groups provide additional support to the water-soluble phosphines and they can be also responsible for the faster migration of aldehydes to the catalytic phase. In addition, as Hernandez and Kalck [10] reported, the presence of TPPTS surplus has an active role to the equilibrium between RuHCl(TPPTS)3 and RuHCl(TPPTS)2(H2O) complexes, reducing also in the later the substitution of Cl− and H2O with arenes. All the experiments regarding the influence of TPPTS/Ru molar ratio were carried out at the optimal temperature and pressure of 80°C and 20bar, respectively. Based on our experiments that are reported in Table 2 , it was clear that the best TPPTS/Ru molar ratio was 4–5 equivalents of TPPTS per Ru atom. According to Grosselin et al. [6] and Nuithitikul and Winterbottom [14], the lack of TPPTS surplus leads to a reduction in the activity of the catalytic system. However, it must be noted that for TPPTS/Ru molar ratios higher than 5, the conversion of the mixture of aldehydes sharply decreased, possibly due to the sorption of the TPPTS on the metallic surface acting after that as a reaction inhibitor [13]. The above observation can be interpreted on the basis of the existence of the equilibrium in Scheme 4 . According to Fache et al. [7], this equilibrium (Scheme 4) probably constitutes the first step of the catalytic hydrogenation of aldehydes in water, in order to generate a vacant coordination site in the coordination sphere of the catalytic metal centre, allowing the coordination of the carbonyl function of aldehydes. Consequently, an excess of TPPTS ligand in aqueous media disfavours current equilibrium. On the other hand, four substrate/Ru molar ratios were tested, between 500 and 2000, in order to find the highest possible conversion at the optimal reaction conditions, as shown in Fig. 3 . It was observed that as the ratio of aldehydes/Ru was decreased so higher was the conversion. This can be explained by the fact that for low aldehydes/Ru molar ratios fewer reactants “compete” for every active catalytic complex, so the reaction is taking place easier giving high conversion. Furthermore, the presence of excess of aldehydes around the catalytic metal centre it seems to decrease the activity of the catalyst, probably due to steric effect phenomenon. Thus, the optimal substrate/Ru molar ratio for our series of experiments can be regarded to be the lower one, the ratio being 500."
9,Influence of the organic solvent and agitation speed,"3.4 Influence of the organic solvent and agitation speed In Fig. 4 is shown that the hydrogenation of the aldehydes’ mixture is solvent dependent [7]. Four different organic solvents (diethylether, toluene, acetophenone, methanol) were examined and are presented in relation with the conversion, yield and TOF of the respective hydrogenation reactions. It is worth mentioning that the catalytic system performed a sufficient catalytic activity (conversion 28.9mol%) even without the presence of an organic solvent. The higher conversions were observed in acetophenone (86.5mol%) and methanol (97.8mol%) solvents, although the final separation of the two liquid phases was more difficult then, due to the good miscibility of these particular organic solvents with the water [26]. In addition, a higher conversion of the aldehydes to the corresponding alcohols was observed by increasing the agitation speed inside the autoclave vessel (Fig. 5 ). It must be noted here our decision to deliberately study the effects of agitation speed at relatively low conversions, in order to differentiate its effects from the effects of other parameters. The agitation speed of the experiments varied between 500 and 2500rpm. The increase of the agitation speed improves the miscibility between the liquid and gas phase of the system and it contributes to better mass transfer phenomena."
10,Conclusion,"To our knowledge, aqueous biphasic hydrogenation of a mixture of aldehydes, which exist in a hydroformylated naphtha, catalysed by Ru/TPPTS complex has been studied for the first time. The RuCl3/TPPTS catalyst was revealed as an effective catalytic system for the hydrogenation of a hydroformylated naphtha model under mild conditions (80°C, 20bar) using a biphasic water/toluene system. However, it is worth mentioning that the catalyst appears instability and simultaneously, decrease in its activity in the presence of hydrogen at temperatures above 100°C. Taking everything into consideration, aqueous biphasic catalytic hydrogenation of a hydroformylated fuel will be capable to enhance in situ the quality of the ultimate fuel by improving the combustion properties with an environmentally friendly process."
