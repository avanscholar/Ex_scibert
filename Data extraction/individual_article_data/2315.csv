0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is being widely investigated as a promising future energy carrier, in particular for mobile applications. Intensive work is ongoing in developing practical solutions to problems in hydrogen storage and conversion to electrical or mechanical energy. In addition, the future sustainable use of hydrogen will require the development of a renewable means of hydrogen production. A variety of biological routes to hydrogen production are available and under investigation (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002; Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009; Hallenbeck, 2011a). Among the various options, photofermentation seems particularly suited for the conversion of some particular wastes to hydrogen as well as being an attractive option for permitting the complete conversion of some feedstocks that are suited for dark fermentation, which however can only produce hydrogen from them at low yields (Hallenbeck, 2005, 2009,2011b; Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009). Photofermentation is the photosynthetically light driven fermentative conversion of organic substrates to biohydrogen principally carried out by photosynthetic bacteria. Thus, photofermentation differs from dark fermentation since it requires light, but the use of photosynthetically derived energy permits the use of substrates from which hydrogen cannot be extracted without energy input (organic acids) as well as in principal driving substrate conversion to completion, not thermodynamically possible without energy input. Consequently, light utilization is the key factor in the photofermentation process and developing effective photobioreactors with efficient internal light distribution characteristics is critical, especially for the industrial scale where self-shading inside the fermenter has to be prevented to ensure maximum hydrogen production (Akkerman et al., 2002; Gadhamshetty et al., 2011). However, this topic, in reality a challenge for bioengineering, is beyond the scope of the present review. Here, we treat the biological properties of the photofermentation process; reviewing the underlying enzymology and metabolism, and discussing various techniques that have been applied to increase the efficient conversion of substrates to hydrogen. Although a large number of studies have used pure compounds, and some are discussed here, we place special emphasis on the use of real waste streams. Substrate costs require that practical application of a photofermentative process use various waste streams, of which a number of different types are abundantly available. Moreover, conversion of these waste streams should not only generate waste treatment credits but can also in some cases improve the economics of the associated industrial process at the same time."
1,Photofermentative organisms and metabolic pathways,"Photofermentative hydrogen production by purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria was first reported more than 60 years ago (Gest and Kamen, 1949). These alpha-proteobacteria appear particularly suited to a photoheterotrophic life style. In this growth mode, they produce energy through photosynthesis, generating ATP through the cyclic functioning of their single photosystem. They depend upon reduced fixed carbon compounds, inorganic ions (Fe2+), or hydrogen as source of electrons for their metabolic activities. Although photoheterotrophic growth was thought to be primarily carried out by these organisms, a marine cyanobacterium possessing only a single photosystem (it lacks water splitting PSII) has recently been described that leads a photoheterotrophic life in the surface waters of the oceans (Tripp et al., 2010). Thus, this growth mode may be more wide spread than previously thought. Actually, there are several sub-types of purple bacteria; sulfur and non-sulfur, it is the purple non-sulfur bacteria which often produce hydrogen (Bryant and Frigaard, 2006). The purple non-sulfur (PNS) bacterial genus Rhodobacter has been the most widely used for biohydrogen production. The PNS bacteria can use a broad spectrum of substrates, a versatility that reflects the variety of natural environments in which they are found. All PNS bacteria can grow photo-heterotrophically and obtain their electrons and carbon requirements from reduced fixed carbon compounds, some species can also grow photolithoautotrophically using S2−, H2 or Fe2+ as electron donors and CO2 as the sole carbon source (Larimer et al., 2004). Depending upon the species, PNS bacteria are able to use a wide variety of organic carbon compounds; pyruvate, acetate and other organic acids, amino acids, alcohols and carbohydrates. Some species can also use one-carbon atom compounds such as methanol and formate, while some other species grow using aromatic organic compounds such as benzoate, cinnamate, chlorobenzoate, phenylacetate and phenol (Harwood, 2008). Rhodobacter species are potent hydrogen producers. Many studies have shown that the PNS photosynthetic bacteria have the ability to use organic acids, simple sugars, glucose, fructose and sucrose, industrial and agricultural effluents for hydrogen production. They prefer to use organic acids such as acetic, butyric (Fang et al., 2005), propionic (Shi and Yu, 2004), malic (Eroglu et al., 1999) and lactic, which gives the highest conversion efficiency (He et al., 2005). Thus, PNS bacteria can be used to convert the organic acids produced during the acidogenic phase of anaerobic digestion of organic wastes to H2 and CO2. Production of hydrogen has been reported for many PNS photosynthetic bacteria; Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Koku et al., 2002; Kapdan and Kargi, 2006), Rhodobacter capsulatus (He et al., 2005), Rhodovulum sulfidophilum W-1S (Maeda et al., 2003) and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (Barbosa et al., 2001). In addition, Rhodospirillum rubrum and R. palustris P4 are capable of the photoproduction of hydrogen from CO via activity of a carbon-monoxide dependent dehydrogenase (CODH) (Oh et al., 2002; Najafpour et al., 2004). Nitrogenase plays a key role in the production of hydrogen gas by photosynthetic bacteria, and the particular requirements for its regulation, biosynthesis, and enzyme activity (Masepohl and Hallenbeck, 2010) set specific conditions which must be met for successful, efficient hydrogen production. It is an iron-sulfur molybdenum enzyme that is highly sensitive to oxygen. Nitrogenase synthesis is repressed by high concentrations of fixed nitrogen, especially ammonium, and oxygen. Active enzyme requires molybdenum, which is also a regulatory factor (Masepohl and Hallenbeck, 2010) and large quantities of iron. Substrate reduction requires high energy electrons and chemical energy input in the form of ATP with 2 ATP/e−, or 4ATP/H2. Enzyme activity is inhibited by the presence of oxygen, ammonia or at high N/C ratios (Koku et al., 2003). Hence, the process requires both anoxic conditions and that ammonium be present in only very limited amounts (Takabatake et al., 2004). Therefore, nitrogen for cell growth that is supplied in the form of proteins, glutamate or yeast extract enhance hydrogen gas production much better than ammonium (Oh et al., 2004; Takabatake et al., 2004). Metabolism shifts to the utilization of organic compounds for cell synthesis or storage (polyhydroxybutyrate) rather than hydrogen production in the presence of high nitrogen concentrations resulting in excess biomass growth and reduction in light diffusion (Oh et al., 2004). The inhibitory action of ammonium is reversible, and hydrogen production activity can be recovered after ammonia is consumed (Takabatake et al., 2004; Masepohl and Hallenbeck, 2010). Photoheterotrophic growth of these bacteria under nitrogen limiting conditions leads to the nearly stoichiometric conversion of various organic acids to hydrogen through the action of their nitrogenase enzyme. Hydrogen production under these conditions by nitrogenase appears to be a response to the metabolic need to maintain redox balance (Hallenbeck, 2011a). Assimilation of the different carbon compounds generates excess electrons as NADH which must be disposed of to permit continued growth and metabolic activity. Therefore, under nitrogen deficient conditions, hydrogen production allows the reoxidation of NADH. Under nitrogen replete conditions, this need is met by CO2 fixation by RuBisCO, an otherwise seemingly paradoxical fixation of carbon dioxide during the assimilation of an organic carbon source. Thus, as much as 68% of the CO2 given off during growth on acetate is refixed through the Calvin cycle (McKinlay and Harwood, 2010). Indeed, the metabolic requirement for this “electron valve” is so important that strains lacking RuBisCO, mutants expressing nitrogenase in presence of replete fixed nitrogen, are readily obtained (Laguna et al., 2010; Hallenbeck, 2011a). As noted above, two energetic requirements for nitrogenase activity, highly reducing electrons and ATP, must be met by cellular metabolism. In both cases, the required energy is ultimately derived from the photosynthetic activity of the organism, primarily by generation of a proton gradient created during electron flow through the photosynthetic apparatus driven by captured light energy. This gradient is then used to generate ATP, through the action of ATP synthase, and high energy electrons, through some form of reverse electron flow (Hallenbeck, 2011a) (Fig. 1 ). During cyclic anoxygenic photosynthesis, a photon stimulates the excitation of bacteriochlorophyll in the reaction centre (RC) and this energy causes the release of an electron which subsequently reduces the membrane quinone (Q) pool. The quinone cycle works to release protons to the periplasmic space and to reduce the cytochrome bc 1 complex, which reduces cytochrome c 2. Cyt c 2 in turn reduces the oxidized primary electron donors in the RC, thus closing the cycle. The protons which have accumulated in the periplasm form an electrochemical gradient which is used by the ATP-synthase to generate ATP. The electrochemical gradient is also used to drive the reduction of ferredoxin, necessary for nitrogenase activity, by NADH by mechanisms which are little understood, but apparently involve either the Rnf or FixABC complexes (Hallenbeck, 2011a). However, hydrogen can also be an electron donor for purple bacteria when it is oxidized by a membrane bound [NiFe] hydrogenase, thus reducing the net hydrogen evolved through nitrogenase activity (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). Thus, hydrogenase negative mutants of photo-fermentative bacteria can be used to enhance hydrogen gas production and have been reported, under some conditions, to produce 2–3 times more hydrogen (Kim et al., 2006). Other factors as well are known to affect hydrogen production via photofermentation process including; light intensity, carbon source, and the type of microbial culture. Increasing light intensity can have, up to a certain point, a stimulatory effect on hydrogen yield as well as production rate, whereas it has a counter effect on light conversion efficiencies (Barbosa et al., 2001; Shi and Yu, 2005). Light intensity may have effect on the consumption rates of organic acids. For example, it has been reported that butyrate consumption requires higher light intensities compared to acetate or propionate (Shi and Yu, 2005). Generally, hydrogen production under dark conditions is much lower than that under illumination (Koku et al., 2003; Oh et al., 2004) and cultures are usually maintained under constant illumination. However, several studies have suggested that higher production rates might be obtained through light/dark cycles, either alternating 14h light/10h dark cycles (Koku et al., 2003), or a 30min light/dark cycle (Wakayama et al., 2000). In what follows, we focus on the potential use of carbohydrate rich wastes as raw material for photofermentative hydrogen production, the use of different microbial cultures, various bio-processing strategies, and recent developments in biohydrogen production by these organisms. One aspect that is reviewed here is the use of photofermentation as an adjunct to dark fermentation to allow additional hydrogen production from the organic acids produced by the dark fermentative organism. This is one strategy among several to derive additional energy (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009). While these fermenter effluents could also be treated by anaerobic digestion, creating a dual gas stream of hydrogen (first stage) and methane (second stage), the photofermentative production of hydrogen has several advantages. For one thing, a process that produces a single gas stream is operationally to be preferred over one that produces multiple products. As well, hydrogen is a more valuable commodity than methane, can be more efficiently used in a fuel cell rather than combusting methane, and production of hydrogen allows carbon capture, and potentially sequestration, at source."
2,Photofermentative hydrogen production from wastes,"Biohydrogen gas production from renewable sources, biomass or water, a seemingly “green technology”, has received considerable attention in recent years. Biohydrogen production can be carried out by a variety of anaerobic and photosynthetic microorganisms (Hallenbeck, 2011a). Under dark anaerobic conditions, hydrogen is produced as one of the fermentation products of carbohydrate rich organic wastes along with organic acids. Some photo-heterotrophic bacteria can utilize these organic acids; acetic, lactic and butyric acids, to produce H2 and CO2. The advantages of this biohydrogen process are the utilization of waste materials and the high yields of H2 gas. However, rates of H2 production are low, which, coupled with the low light conversion efficiencies observed, mean that these technologies require further research and development. As already discussed, the conversion of a variety of substrates, usually organic acids, to hydrogen by photosynthetic bacteria has already been examined in many previous studies. Usually these substrates are in pure form, but many studies have demonstrated this process with suitable waste streams that are rich in these substrates, or others, such as the crude glycerol fraction derived from biodiesel manufacture (Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck, 2009). The remainder of this review will examine the ongoing research into the use of specific waste streams are that particularly well suited for photofermentation, or the conversion of the waste stream from dark hydrogen fermentations to additional hydrogen through photofermentation."
3,Waste resources,"3.1 Waste resources A wide variety of possible waste streams are potentially available for biohydrogen production, and there are a number of major factors affecting their suitability as possible substrates. Among these, overall abundance, relative cost, carbohydrate content, and ease of degradation, can significantly impact overall process economics. Organic acid containing wastes would be the most suitable for photofermentative hydrogen production, but waste streams rich in these are relatively rare as the majority of agro-industrial waste streams usually contain a mixture of simple carbohydrates (sugars) and complex, polymeric carbohydrates. Obviously, simple sugars are easily attacked and are the preferred substrates for dark fermentations. Moreover, effluents from hydrogen producing fermentative reactors contain large quantities of organic acids, suitable substrates for subsequent photofermentation. However, in general, pure sugars, or waste streams largely composed of them may be too expensive to use as substrates for hydrogen production. More likely raw materials are waste streams containing complex carbohydrates, such as starch or cellulose, and these necessitate additional hydrolysis and/or pretreatment steps before fermentation to hydrogen. Again, these may be more suitable for use in a first stage dark fermentation with the resulting liquid metabolites being subsequently used for a second photofermentation stage. Thus, the performance of different simple and complex carbohydrates as well as various waste streams in dark fermentations is also briefly presented in what follows. 3.1.1 Wastes containing organic acids Many fermentation products are natural substrates for photofermentation and hence it is not surprising that waste streams of the fermentation industry are readily directly used by PNS bacteria to produce hydrogen (Fig. 2 ). Thus, one study demonstrated the conversion of brewery waste water, which consists mainly of ethanol, acetate and propionate, to hydrogen (Table 1 , Seifert et al., 2010b). This is the best use for this class of wastes since little or no hydrogen could be produced from these substrates using dark fermentation. 3.1.2 Wastes containing simple sugars Many agro-industrial waste streams; brewery wastes, dairy industry residues, and the effluents of many food processing plants, contain appreciable amounts of simple sugars, mono- and di-saccharides. Monosaccharides are directly utilizable for hydrogen production by many organisms which are also of course usually capable of also converting the disaccharides to their component hexoses and pentoses. Many of these enter the glycolytic pathway in a similar fashion to glucose and their metabolism to hydrogen can be modeled on that of glucose. Theoretically, 12mol of H2 can be produced by the oxidation of 1mol of glucose. However, the reaction stoichiometry of dark fermentation process is such that much less hydrogen is actually produced, with the maximum hydrogen yield, 4mol H2/mole glucose, being obtained when acetate is the end product, while only 2mol H2/mole glucose are formed when butyrate is the end product (Hallenbeck, 2005, 2009, 2011b). This yield might be increased when photofermentation is combined with dark fermentation as discussed below. The lower than theoretical yield is due to the constraints of known hydrogen fermentation pathways which necessitate the production of additional fermentation products to permit ATP synthesis and NADH reoxidation as well as the utilization of some of the substrate for cell biosynthesis. Conversion of glucose, available in various waste streams, in particular those of corn processing, to hydrogen has been particularly well studied. A very large number of studies with pure or mixed cultures under a variety of conditions have shown that maximum hydrogen yields under mesophilic conditions range from 1 or less to about 2.5mol of H2 per mole of glucose (Li and Fang, 2007; Davila-Vazquez et al., 2008), or at most 20% of that available from total oxidation and only 62% of the maximum predicted from the metabolic pathways involved. Many studies using a variety of organisms and different operational modes, batch, semi-continuous, and continuous, have examined dark fermentation of sucrose, available as the byproduct of sugar refining (molasses) to hydrogen with reported yields varying from 1.2 to 3.9mol of H2 per mole of sucrose (Li and Fang, 2007; Davila-Vazquez et al., 2008), although a yield of 4.5mol H2 /mole sucrose in a CSTR with a 8h HRT has been reported (Chen and Lin, 2003). (The theoretical yield here based on metabolic pathways is 8mol H2/mole sucrose.) Similarly, hydrogen production from lactose, available in whey and other dairy industry effluents, gives a maximum yield of 2–3mol H2/mole lactose (Davila-Vazquez et al., 2008), although the theoretical yield based on metabolic pathways is 8mol H2/mole lactose. Thus, in general, the yield per mole of hexose obtained by dark fermentation appears, not surprisingly, to be almost the same for all types of mono- and di-saccharides examined. Since this is well below the amount of hydrogen potentially available in the substrate, additional measures must be taken to extract the remaining energy (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009). One attractive method is to use the effluents of dark fermentation reactors as substrate for a second stage photofermentation as discussed in detail below. Of course another alternative, little explored until now, is to directly convert simple sugars to hydrogen by photofermentation (Abo-Hashesh et al., 2011), but in the only example where a real waste stream (sugar refinery) was used, no hydrogen production was observed without supplementation with organic acid (malate) (Yetis et al., 2000). 3.1.3 Carbohydrate (starch and cellulose) containing wastes Many agricultural and food industry wastes are rich in complex carbohydrates, containing mainly either starch and/or cellulose. However, the specific characteristics of a particular waste may negatively impact its usefulness in hydrogen production in a number of ways. The complex carbohydrates must first be depolymerized to their constituent sugars. This is more easily done for starch containing wastes using enzymatic or acid hydrolysis. Cellulose containing wastes may require extensive mechanical, chemical and enzymatic pre-treatment. In fact, eliminating the lignin form lignocellulosic materials and efficiently converting the cellulose and hemicelluloses to their constituent sugars is one of the major challenges in developing effective biomass to biofuels systems. Once a stream of simple sugars is produced from these wastes, they can obviously be treated by dark fermentation to give hydrogen and organic acids which in turn can be converted to additional hydrogen by photofermentation. The use of dark fermentation to produce hydrogen from wastes has been extensively researched (Chong et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2010; Hallenbeck et al., 2009)"
4,Photofermentation bio-processing technologies,"A number of different configurations are possible for the use of photofermentation in the conversion of wastes to hydrogen (Fig. 2). The different possibilities include; a single state with photofermentation only, a sequential two stage system with an initial dark fermentative degradation of substrate to hydrogen and fermentation products, mainly organic acids, followed by a second stage light driven photofermentation of these products to hydrogen, and a combined system where the dark fermentaiton and photofermentation take place simultaneously in the same vessel. The optimal strategy depends on the nature of the substrate and potentially a number of other factors, as discussed in more detail below."
5,Photofermentation substrate issues,"4.1 Photofermentation substrate issues In common with dark fermentation, substrates containing complex carbohydrates, principally starch and cellulose, need pretreatment and depolymerization before use in photofermentation. However, waste effluents may be problematic in a number of other ways since they may contain inhibitory factors that need to be removed or require amendment to render them more susceptible to decomposition of hydrogen. Obviously, one property that may negatively affect photofermentation is the optical clarity of the waste water. Light intensity is a major factor affecting photofermentation since increasing light intensity, up to a certain point, generally results in increased hydrogen production, but after that point photo-inhibition occurs. Different wastewaters have different degrees of transparency and therefore may require different illumination intensities for optimal hydrogen production. Light absorbing compounds or turbidity will reduce light penetration and therefore reduce light conversion efficiency. Effluents that have high ammonia concentrations are problematic due to ammonia inhibition of nitrogenase synthesis or activity. In addition, a high organic matter content (COD) or the presence of toxic compounds such as heavy metals, phenolics or other aromatic hydrocarbons, may also negatively impact hydrogen production. The simplest solution for many of these problems is dilution, but this needs to be avoided as much as possible due to inevitable increases in handling costs. For batch hydrogen production, optimization of the wastewater concentration is important for a number of reasons. Low substrate concentrations can cause substrate limitation, and high substrate concentrations can cause product inhibition. The length of the lag phase greatly influences the overall rate of hydrogen production and more complex wastewaters can present a longer lag phase. For example, olive mill waste (OMW) must be highly diluted to reduce the inhibitory effects of its high organic content and dark color (Eroglu et al., 2004). Another example is tofu manufacturing wastewater, rich in carbohydrates and protein, where a two-fold dilution was shown to increase hydrogen yields (Zhu et al., 2002). In addition, using untreated wastewater for photofermentation may be problematic due to the growth of indigenous fermentative organisms. Since these usually have faster growth rates than photosynthetic bacteria they are likely to out compete the photosynthetic bacteria. Thus, sterile conditions might be necessary to permit the growth of the desired photosynthetic bacterium. Choosing the proper wastewater pretreatment method is very important point since some sterilization processes might damage the potential substrate. Four different pre-treatment techniques for dairy wastewater have been assessed; illumination with UV radiation, thermal treatment at 50°C, treatment with 1% hydrogen peroxide, and thermal sterilization, found to be the best sterilization method (Seifert et al., 2010a)."
6,Conversion of wastes by single stage photo-fermentation systems,"4.2 Conversion of wastes by single stage photo-fermentation systems Some waste streams can be directly converted to hydrogen by photofermentation (Fig 2, Table 1). These include waste streams from the brewing industry and olive oil mills, both of which contain organic acids and simple alcohols, suitable substrates for biological hydrogen production in the presence of light using Rhodobacter or Rhodopseudomonas strains. Since some photoheterotrophic strains can also use simple sugars like glucose, fructose, or sucrose (Jeong et al., 2008; Tao et al., 2008; Fang et al., 2006), they can also probably produce hydrogen from the simple sugars present in these waste streams, or others, such as waste waters from the dairy or sugar industries. Again, substrates to be used should contain only low concentrations of nitrogen to avoid inhibition of nitrogenase, the hydrogen producing enzyme. For biohydrogen production from dairy wastewater with R. sphaeroides O.U.001, 9000lux of light intensity was found to be the best value for efficient hydrogen production. The dairy wastewater was shown to be a good substrate for a hydrogen photofermentation process, but it needed to be diluted by at least 60% to prevent ammonium inhibition. Under these conditions, a maximum hydrogen of 3.6L H2/L was obtained with 0.36g dry weight/L (Seifert et al., 2010a). Brewery wastewaters contain a variety of organic compounds including amino acids, proteins, organic acids, sugars, alcohols as well as vitamin B. Many of these are useful compounds for photobiological hydrogen production, serving either directly as substrates for the photofermentative process, or as necessary growth factors. Brewery wastewaters have also been used for photo-biological hydrogen production by R. sphaeroides after filtration and sterilization at 120°C for 20min (Seifert et al., 2010b). Under an illumination of 116W/m2, the optimum waste dilution was found to be 10% v/v. This is much greater in comparison with dairy wastewater, but necessary due to the high nitrogen content of brewery wastes. Under optimal conditions, 2.24L H2/L medium and 1.7% light conversion efficiency was achieved by this process (Seifert et al., 2010b). The starch in wheat, after pretreatment, was found to be a suitable substrate for single stage photofermentation. Batch experiments with ground wheat were used to select the most suitable strain among three different pure strains of R. sphaeroides. The type of the strain was found to greatly influence hydrogen production rates. Ground wheat was pretreated by acid hydrolysis (pH 3) and autoclaved at 90°C for 15min. R. sphaeroides RV gave the maximum hydrogen production with a yield of 1.23mol H2/mol glucose, and a specific hydrogen production rate of 46mL H2/g-biomass/h (Kapdan et al., 2009). Crude glycerol is becoming available in large quantities as it is a waste product of biodiesel manufacture; 1kg of glycerol is produced for every ten liters of biodiesel. An initial study has shown that this is an effective substrate for photofermentative hydrogen production, with 6mol of H2/mol glycerol being obtained (Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck, 2009). Waste glycerol is an example of a waste with a low nitrogen concentration, and for this reason added nitrogen might improve the hydrogen yields. Several improvements could be made to this system, possibly improving the yield, including; reducing the lag phase by changing the inoculum concentration or media formulation, optimizing the light intensity and improving the R. palustris strain used through genetic engineering. In addition, has been suggested that photofermentation of glycerol should be a continuous process (Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck, 2009). Olive mill effluent (OME) is the main wastewater produced by the olive oil industry and is another potential substrate for bio-hydrogen production since it contains sugars, volatile acids, polyalcohols, and fats. In addition, it has a low nitrogen content, making it a good candidate as a substrate for photofermentative hydrogen production. OME was successfully converted to hydrogen (27.4mmoles H2/g COD) in batch studies with R. sphaeroides (Eroglu et al., 2004). However, OME had to be diluted to a 1% solution due to its dark color, highlighting the fact that physical characteristics such as color and viscosity are other important parameters in addition to chemical composition in considering wastes for photofermentation. This sets up a somewhat paradoxical situation in which the concentration of dark colored wastewaters should be reduced as much as possible to permit optimum light penetration into the culture, but economics, plant footprint and low pumping costs are favored by the use of minimal dilution, i.e. high substrate concentrations. Therefore, improvement, either through manipulation of illumination conditions or genetic modification of the bacterium to enhance its capability to use wastewaters effectively, is desirable. Thus, hydrogen production from various wastewaters would seem like a promising, ecologically friendly technology. In addition, associating hydrogen production with waste treatment could increase overall process economic viability. However, there are some technical problems and disadvantages. For example, for some types of wastewaters like OME and dairy industry wastewater, illumination should be adjusted to higher values than using pure substrates which potentially translates to increased costs. Adjusting the type of the reactor by means of increasing the illumination area, for example, using flat plate reactors, could be a good solution for decreasing illumination costs, but, on the other hand, flat panel reactors could have higher construction costs and need more space compared to cylindrical reactors. Other economic considerations in using wastewaters directly in one stage photo-fermentation are the costs of pre-treatment operations, sterilization or filtration, and dilution of wastewater, required for dark colored, opaque wastewaters."
7,Conversion of wastes by sequential dark and photo-fermentation systems,"4.3 Conversion of wastes by sequential dark and photo-fermentation systems Sequential dark and photo-fermentation systems have been shown to be relatively efficient processes to produce hydrogen through fermentation and have certain advantages over single stage dark or photo-fermentation processes (Yang et al., 2010). The effluent of dark fermentation in hydrogen production provides sufficient quantities of organic acids for photofermentation as mentioned in previous sections, thereby eliminating any limitation due to availability of organic acids (Tao et al., 2007). Theoretically, 1mol of glucose yields 12mol of hydrogen via complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (Eq. 1). However, this reaction is not favorable thermodynamically during dark fermentation processes.Complete oxidation (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 12 H 2 + 6 CO 2 Dark fermentation (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 + 2 CH 3 COOH Photo fermentation (3) 2 CH 3 COOH + 4 H 2 O + Light Energy → 8 H 2 + 4 CO 2 In photofermentation, light energy could supply the ATP required to drive the reaction to completion and produce 12mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose (Eq. 1). On the other hand, in the absence of external energy, dark fermentation by fermentative bacteria results in the production of other by-products, and the maximum hydrogen yield is 4mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose when acetic acid is the sole liquid by-product (Eq. 2). In the case of sequential dark and photofermentation systems, dark fermentation could produce 4mol of hydrogen (Eq. 2) and the acetic acid that is produced could be used as a substrate for photofermentation, resulting in production of 8mol hydrogen (Eq. 3) from this second stage with an overall production of 12mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose. However, in practice, the maximum hydrogen yield per mole of glucose via sequential dark and photo-fermentation systems is lower than theoretical since part of the substrate is used for microbial growth and metabolism (Manish and Banerjee, 2008). Thus, research into two-stage, sequential systems is being carried out (Fig. 2, Table 2 ). In the first stage, dark fermentation, a relatively easily applied and cost-effective technology for biological hydrogen production which can operate continuously without light input, produces hydrogen at low yields along with the simultaneous production of short chain organic acids. In the second stage, photofermentation with non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria is used to efficiently convert the short chain organic acids to hydrogen. The first step of a two stage system can be conducted with anaerobic fermentative bacteria like Clostridium species or mixed anaerobic consortia which convert the organic substrates to organic acids, alcohols, H2 and CO2. In the second stage, light energy is used by photoheterotrophic bacteria like Rhodobacter or Rhodopseudomonas species to convert the organic acids and alcohols to hydrogen. Therefore combining these two systems sequentially holds the promise of being a very useful and productive method for the economic production of hydrogen. Numerous studies on biological hydrogen production with two-stage systems have been carried out (Table 2). Many studies examined biohydrogen production using either the spectrum of pure organic acids; acetate, butyrate, lactate, propionate which are the main products of dark fermentation (Asada et al., 2008; Barbosa et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2007; Ozgur et al., 2010c; Uyar et al., 2009) or actual fermentation effluents (Ozgur et al., 2010a,b). Simple sugars like glucose (Liu et al., 2010; Su et al., 2009a) and sucrose (Chen et al., 2010; Tao et al., 2008) have been used as input substrate for hydrogen production by two-stage systems, with the rationale that achieving high hydrogen production rates with pure substrates could lead to studies using industrial wastes as carbon sources for two stage systems. Relatively high yields from simple sugars, such as sucrose, have been obtained using the sequential process (Chen et al., 2010; Tao et al., 2008) Using ground wheat after hydrolysis (acid or enzymatic) pre-treatment for hydrogen production with two-stage systems resulted in good hydrogen production efficiencies (Ozmihci and Kargi, 2010; Argun et al., 2009). R. sphaeroides (NRRL-B1727) in pure culture was used in a second stage for continuous photofermentation of the volatile fatty acids (VFA) present (1950mg/L) in the dark fermentation effluent of ground wheat starch. A maximum hydrogen production rate of 27mL H2/L/day and with a yield of 185mL H2/g VFA was achieved with an HRT of 72h using a PC controlled fermenter (Ozmihci and Kargi, 2010). Cassava is another low-cost biomass source rich in starch which can grow well in barren and arid areas, and is presently extensively cultivated all over the world. It has an approximate content of 60–70% moisture, 15–20% starch and 4–6% free sugar. It is presumed to be an ideal energy crop because of its high productivity and minimal competition for arable land suited for food crops. However, it is an important food crop in the developing world, and is the third most important source of carbohydrates for human nutrition world-wide. Thus if cassava is to be used for biofuel production, care must be taken not to divert it from the food chain. Mixed bacterial cultures were used to improve the hydrogen yield from cassava starch, after conversion to reducing sugars by gelatinization or enzymatic hydrolysis, using a combination of dark and photofermentation. For dark fermentation, batch reactors containing a mixed hydrogen producing culture (Clostridium species were dominant) were used. For photofermentation, mixed photosynthetic bacteria (mainly R. palustris) immobilized in agar gels were used. Using this combination of dark and photofermentation, a hydrogen yield of 351mL H2/g starch (2.53mol H2/mol hexose) was significantly increased to 840mL H2/g starch (6.07mol H2/mol hexose) and 686mL H2/g starch (Cheng et al., 2011). Thus this study showed that the hydrogen performance is enhanced by combining dark fermentation with photofermentation. The effect of pretreatment of cassava starch on biohydrogen production was investigated. For dark fermentation with preheated activated sludge as inoculum, different raw cassava starch concentrations of 10–25g/L had different effects on hydrogen yields, maximum of 240 mL H2/g starch, and productivity, maximum rate of 84.4mL H2/L/h at 25g/L starch. Pretreating the cassava starch with heat or hydrolysis with amylase and glucoamylase increased the hydrogen yields to 260mL H2/g starch and 280mL H2/g starch. Importantly for practical applications, pretreatment also decreased the lag time. Maximum hydrogen yields were increased to 402mL H2/ g starch by adding a second stage photofermentation (Su et al., 2009b). Thus hydrogen production from cassava starch using a combination of dark fermentation and photofermentation is feasible. Various factors could affect the economic costs of this process, but certainly pretreatment operations might play a large role. The system should be improved for continuous operations. Corncobs are a relatively abundant agricultural waste with an annual production in China alone of over 20 million metric tons and represent a cellulose-rich waste which can potentially be used to produce biohydrogen. Corncobs were used as a substrate for biohydrogen production after hydrolysis with boiling dilute hydrochloric acid. Using a two stage integrated dark fermentation and photofermentation process 200g powdered corncob could be converted into 6mol hydrogen (Yang et al., 2010). French fries and potato chips are the main consumer products of the fast food industry. Potato steam peels (PSP), byproducts of this industry, contain mainly carbohydrates, proteins, and organic acids, thus making PSP a suitable candidate for biological hydrogen production. Molasses is a major byproduct of sugar industry and has a high sucrose content. Effluents from the thermophilic dark fermentation of molasses and PSPs with Caldicellusiruptor saccharolytus were used as substrate for the photofermentative bacterium R. capsulatus (DSM 1710). The effect of dilution and the addition of buffers and nutrients on hydrogen production by dark and photofermentation were investigated using batch cultures. With some adjustments, PSP and molasses give high yields of biological hydrogen production. The C/N ratio and pH of the medium were found to be very important factors for effective hydrogen production. Principally, it is necessary to adjust the pH and add buffers to the dark fermentation effluent before photofermentation. Addition of Fe and Mo to PSP and molasses increased hydrogen yields. An overall yield of 5.81mol H2/mol hexose and 3.91mol H2/mol hexose was achieved by using molasses and PSPs respectively (Ozgur et al., 2010b). Different types of Rhodobacter strains can produce different amounts of hydrogen using the same amount of PSP under the same conditions in a two-stage system operated as batch reactors. R. capsulatus (DSM1710), R. capsulatus hup − (YO3), R. sphaeroides O.U. 001 (DSM 5864), R. sphaeroides O.U.001 hup − and R. palustris were used for photofermentation experiments using thermophilic dark fermenter effluents of PSP as substrate. R. capsulatus gave the highest hydrogen production of 117mmol H2/L DFE (dark fermenter effluent) and a molar yield of 24% of the theoretical value (Afsar et al., 2011). Another feasibility study on the sequential operation of thermophilic dark fermentation and photofermentation used sugar beet molasses as substrate. A hydrogen yield of 4.2mol H2/mol sucrose was obtained after thermophilic dark fermentation, which is low compared with theoretical values. However the main advantage of this effluent is its low content of NH 4 + which makes it a suitable substrate for photofermentation. Addition of Fe and Mo improved hydrogen production with R. capsulatus hup − and R. palustris strains. The overall hydrogen yield for the two step fermentation process was 13.7mol H2/mol sucrose, or 57% of the theoretical value of 24mol H2/mol sucrose (Ozgur et al., 2010b). From these studies it can be concluded that before using the dark fermenter effluents in photofermentation step a detailed analysis of the contents should be carried out, especially for important nutrients such as Fe and Mo which are required for nitrogenase, enzyme responsible for hydrogen production during photofermentation (Kars et al., 2006). The concentration of NH 4 + is another important factor since high concentrations can decrease hydrogen production due to inhibition of nitrogenase synthesis or activity. Olive mill wastewater (OME) can also be used by two-stage systems for hydrogen production. Two different two-stage systems have been tried for this purpose. The first two-step process is combined dark fermentation by active sludge cultures with photofermentation by R. sphaeroides O.U.001 in batch reactors. The highest hydrogen production of 29L H2/L OME after photofermentation was obtained by using 50% (v/v) diluted effluent from the dark fermentation stage as substrate source. The second two-stage process examined involved a clay pre-treatment step followed by photofermentation resulting in 35L H2/L OME with the effluent of the clay pre-treatment process (4% (v/v)) (Eroglu et al., 2006). As previously discussed, using OME directly for photofermentation is problematic due to light penetration problems caused by the dark color of the wastewater. High dilutions, too costly for large scale or industrial applications, were needed for effective single stage hydrogen production. Therefore, two-stage systems seem to be an effective and useful solution for using high concentrations of OME. Cheese whey wastewater is a very significant byproduct of the cheese processing industry. Due to its high content of carbohydrate and micronutrients it is a suitable wastewater for biological hydrogen production. Hydrogen was produced from cheese whey wastewater in a two-stage biological process which combined thermophilic dark fermentation with photofermentation using R. palustris (DSM 127). Using cheese whey directly affected the hydrogen production performances because of its high nitrogen content. Dilution with malic acid (1/5) gave the highest yield, 349mL H2/g COD (Azbar and Cetinkaya-Dokgoz, 2010). Thus, it seems that combining two main biohydrogen production processes, dark fermentation and photofermentation, can improve the hydrogen production from wastes and wastewaters by photoheterotrophic bacteria (Table 1). Unlike one stage systems, high concentrations of organic renewable resources can be used in this process since they can be treated by using them first in dark fermentation reactors. The success of using effluents from dark fermentation depends primarily upon their composition, with the presence of elemental nutrients like Fe, Mo being beneficial, since they are required for the hydrogen producing enzymes, and the presence of NH 4 + being detrimental, since it can inhibit hydrogen production. Therefore the concentration of these compounds should be carefully adjusted before the photofermentation operation. Diluting the effluent solution with malic acid or lactic acid can improve hydrogen production capacity, similar to the well known co-substrate effect known to enhance the performance of anaerobic systems. Using different renewable sources, either singly, or especially in combination with a substrate known to be rich in particular nutrients, could be an ecological and economical solution for effective biohydrogen production. Alternatively, dark and photo-fermentations can be realized in a single stage by combined fermentation as detailed in the next section."
8,Conversion of wastes by combining dark- and photo-fermentation,"4.4 Conversion of wastes by combining dark- and photo-fermentation Combining dark- and photo-fermentation in a single stage co-culture is another process that aims at reducing by-products of the fermentation process and hence increasing the hydrogen yield (Fig. 2, Table 2). In principle this is a simpler process than sequential dark and photofermentations since it eliminates some manipulations. In theory, this approach has two advantages. Acidification due to the dark fermentation reactions can be balanced by the alkalinization caused by photofermentation, thus eliminating the requirement for external pH adjustment. As well, in principle there is little need for an intermediary dilution step, required for sequential operations due to substrate inhibition, since the products of dark fermentation will be consumed in the photofermentation reaction as they are produced. Co-culture of anaerobic and photosynthetic bacteria in single stage has been used in several studies with pure substrates (glucose) and highly variable yields have been obtained, ranging from 0.9 to 7.1mol H2/mole glucose (Abo-Hashesh et al., 2011). At the highest yields this process obviously represents an advance over dark fermentation alone. Several studies have shown that this strategy can be used to obtain hydrogen in relatively high yields form starch accumulating algae as substrate (Ike et al., 1999; Kawaguchi et al., 2001). A higher hydrogen yield, but lower production rate was noted for the co-culture of Lactobacillus amylovous and R. marinum as compared to sequential two stage fermentation (Kawaguchi et al., 2001). This study demonstatrated that the pH of the mixed fermentation remains close to neutrality whereas the pH of effluents from the first stage usually have to be adjusted before photofermentation. In a study using ground wheat starch as substrate, the effect of substrate concentration/cell concentration was investigated in a combined single stage dark and photofermentation batch reactor with a ratio of dark to photosynthetic bacteria of 1/10 (Argun et al., 2009). The highest hydrogen yield (176mL H2/g starch) was obtained at 20g/L wheat powder. It was found that low concentrations of wheat powder gave higher cumulative hydrogen production values with inhibition at high concentrations (Argun et al., 2009). However, there are several challenges in mixed fermentation processes including potential differences in organic acid production/consumption rates, possibly leading to accumulation of organic acids in the medium, as well as potential decreases in light penetration due to higher suspended solids. At any rate, it would appear that either sequential or combined dark and photo-fermentations could be suitable approaches for improving hydrogen yields. It has been estimated that a hydrogen yield of 8mol H2/mol glucose would be sufficient for economical biohydrogen production. Obviously, dark fermentation with reported yields of around 2.5mol H2 per mole glucose is well below this benchmark. However, combined or sequential fermentations have already in some cases been reported to have yields up to 7mol H2 per mole glucose. Thus these systems merit further study towards the development of practical processes."
9,Photofermentative biohydrogen production by immobilized systems,"Biological hydrogen production by photofermentation with suspended cell-culture systems has been extensively studied. Suspended cell culture systems have the advantage of good mass transfer between microorganisms and substrates but the disadvantage of not being able to maintain sufficient concentrations of hydrogen producing bacteria in the reactor at low HRT conditions since at sufficiently high flow rates, cell wash-out can occur. In addition, in many cases, photofermentation with suspended cultures under continuous conditions has been characterized by low hydrogen production rates and low light conversion efficiencies. Immobilization of microorganisms for production of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals has been extensively investigated, and in most cases, system performance is improved by immobilization. Immobilization techniques can generally be divided into three main categories; adsorption (biofilm formation), encapsulation, and entrapment. The most important criterion is to select a non toxic, durable and porous material with a high retention capacity. Every immobilization technique and each material have their own advantages and disadvantages (Hallenbeck, 1983) Studies conducted on dark fermentation with immobilized systems have shown that immobilization improves the hydrogen production rate and biomass concentration (Zhang et al., 2008). High hydrogen production values with different immobilization techniques (attachment, granulation, flocculation and entrapment) ranging from 0.93 to 7.33L/L/h at low HRTs (between 0.5 and 4h) have been shown in a variety of studies. In comparison, suspended systems give hydrogen production rates of 0.15–0.58L/L/h at 6h HRT, demonstrating that immobilization of microorganisms can greatly increase reactor performance and biomass retention (Zhang et al., 2007; Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009). Among the major bottlenecks to the industrial applications of the photofermentation process are the low growth rate of these organisms and their inefficient utilization of light energy (Chen and Chang, 2006; Zhu et al., 1999a). Developing an effective immobilized system is probably the best option for increasing the biomass concentration which also might increase the light utilization efficiencies in photobioreactors (Liao et al., 2010). There have been some studies on immobilization of photofermentative bacteria for hydrogen production (Table 3 ). One of the most investigated immobilization techniques is cell entrapment, which seems to be a promising immobilization technique because it is relatively low cost and easily performed. Moreover, it provides a greater biomass content in the bioreactor and can create a local anaerobic environment. Additionally, entrapped systems can be operated at low HRT without cell washout occurring. The main disadvantages of gel entrapment systems are low hydrogen production rates, insufficient supply of light, weak mechanical strength, and poor stability over long-term operation. Agar, agarose, alginate, carrageenan and chitosan are the most widely used entrapment materials. The levels of hydrogen production from benzoate by R. palustris cells immobilized in agar, agarose, c-carrageenan and sodium alginate were determined. Immobilization in agar, agarose and carrageenan resulted in decreased H2 formation, as compared to free cells in liquid cultures. This effect might be due partly to cell damage caused by the 45–50°C temperature used during the immobilization process with these matrices. Sodium alginate beads are produced at room temperature, and alginate-immobilized cells exhibited higher H2 production than liquid cultures. Reducing the diameter of the gel bead from 3 to 0.05mm caused an increase in hydrogen production from benzoate from 145 to 272μmol H2/g dry weight/h, and an increase in yield from 9.3 to 13.2mol H2/mol benzoate (Fissler et al., 1995). Thus, when using gel beads, the diameter of the gel beads is a critical factor since smaller diameter beads means more surface area, and thus higher biomass densities. A transparent and effectively modified entrapment matrix was recently developed and used to create a photobioreactor packed with entrapped-photosynthetic bacteria gel granules in a continuous hydrogen production mode. The matrix used for entrapment of R. palustris was composed of polyvinyl alcohol-124 (PVA) and carregenan powder. Continuous operation lasted for 3months with a hydrogen production rate of 2.61mmol H2/L/h and a yield of 3.59mol H2/mol glucose (Wang et al., 2010). This immobilization technique has many advantages, such as high mechanical strength, compared with other entrapment techniques. Likewise, R. palustris CQK 01 was immobilized in PVA-boric acid gel granules to improve hydrogen production rates and yields from glucose in a photobioreactor. The polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-boric acid gel granules were found to have a number of advantageous properties including transparency and a porous structure, leading to good mass transport. SEM analysis showed a porous structure with a good concentration of biomass. Hydrogen production lasted for 20days, a good duration for gel systems, with a rate of 3.6mmol/g cell dry weight/h and a yield of 0.23mol H2/mol substrate (Tian et al., 2009). These are examples of compounds that give gels with good mechanical strength, adequate porosity and transparency for light penetration, thus making entrapment methods a very promising technique for use with photosynthetic bacteria. Of course there are additional considerations including the requirement that the entrapment polymer be inexpensive and easily handled permitting scale up to industrial applications. Wastewaters can also be used as substrates for entrapped cultures. Tofu manufacturing wastewater was treated with an immobilized reactor packed with R. sphaeroides in 2% agar gels with a maximum rate of hydrogen production of 2.1L/h/ m2 gel with a hydrogen yield of 1.9mL/mL wastewater (Zhu et al., 1999b). Practical photo-biological hydrogen production would probably require a system allowing for continuous production. Cell immobilization, either through entrapment or biofilm formation, is one means of achieving this. In general, biofilm systems are widely used because they possess several advantages such as; high substrate conversion efficiencies, long term retention of biomass, and avoidance of product inhibition. However, the disadvantages of encapsulation systems; poor mass transfer, insufficient immobilized biomass, and low light conversion efficiencies, also apply to biofilm systems (Zhang et al., 2010). In an effort to improve the efficiency of light utilization and hydrogen production rates PSB cells were immobilized by formation of a biofilm on the surface of transparent packing materials (glass beads) (Tian et al., 2010). The effects of light wavelength, illumination intensity, temperature, pH and substrate concentration on the performance of the photobioreactor were investigated. It was noted that 0.12M influent glucose concentration gave the best hydrogen yield, with values greater than 0.12M causing substrate inhibition. Illumination intensity is another key factor that affects photohydrogen production and light conversion efficiencies. The best value for the biofilm photobioreactor (BPBR) was 56% at 5000lux (590nm) (Tian et al., 2010). Surface attachment would seem to be conducive to a higher efficiency of light energy utilization (Chen and Chang, 2006). However, the BPBR was reported to have a very long start-up period, with biofilm formation requiring 60days of constant circulation. This lengthy period would be a serious disadvantage for scale up and thus for potential industrial application. In another study R. palustris CQK 01 was immobilized on the surface of a glass slide and the effect of illumination on biofilm formation, structure, and photo-hydrogen production performance observed. Hydrogen production was shown to be influenced not only by bacterial biomass but also by the microstructure of the biofilm which effects light penetration and mass transport. Comparison of biofilm characteristics under different illumination intensities by scanning electron microscopy showed that the highest hydrogen production performance corresponded to the largest single cells (obtained at 5000lux). Again 590nm was found to be the best illumination wavelength supporting the highest hydrogen production rates. Illumination intensity and wavelength directly effects the formation of the PSB biofilm. The maximum hydrogen production rate achieved was 11.2mmol/m2/h at a flow rate of 70mL/h with 60mM glucose, giving a yield of 0.25mol H2/mol glucose with a light conversion efficiency of 8.9% (Liao et al., 2010). Biofilm formation on a flat surface causes lower light conversion efficiencies compared to glass beads because the increase in biofilm thickness causes difficulties in mass transport and penetration of the light to the cells on the bottom part of the biofilm. Using glass beads can increase the surface area and can create conditions for good mass transfer of substrate to microorganisms as well as better light penetration compared to flat panel surfaces. Porous glass provides a high surface to volume ratio for effective medium exchange. However, the negative charge on the glass surface may decrease bacterial adsorption, creating problems with bacterial immobilization. Therefore, one study applied a special technique involving positive charge modification of the glass surface in order to enhance the adsorption of bacteria (Tsygankov et al., 1994). A photobioreactor (working volume of 15.6mL) containing a modified porous sheet as a matrix for immobilization of R. sphaeroides RV was used for continuous hydrogen production (1.3mL H2/h/mL porous glass) for 40days. Porous glass has many advantageous properties as an immobilization material for biological light energy conversion systems. Glass supports are stable, inert to microorganisms, do not present appreciable diffusion barriers for substrates and products, are transparent, and have high surface-volume ratios. However, their expense may make them problematic for industrial applications. Polyurethane foam can be used as a support material as an alternative to glass materials and has similar characteristics such as; light penetration, stability, and high surface to volume ratio, with the additional advantage of being cheaper. Polyurethane foam was used as a support material for R. sphaeroides GL-1in a photobioreactor comprised of a glass cuvette with a polyurethane foam. The highest rate of H2 evolution (0.21mL H2/h/mL matrix) was at 300W/m2, lower than for glass particles. Lactate to H2 conversion efficiencies increased with increasing of light intensities up to 300W/m2 which gave a 86% conversion efficiency. The system was stable for 35days (Fedorov et al., 1998). Thus, polyurethane foam is a good alternative support material for immobilization, and immobilization took 7–9days, appreciably less time than the glass bead system. Surface features are a very important characteristic in biofilm formation. Rough and patterned surfaces provide a better environment for bacterial adhesion compared with smooth surfaces. Surface topography greatly influences the pattern of cell retention. A different kind of photobioreactor fabricated from polymethyl metachrilate with grooves etched on the vessel walls was developed for continuous hydrogen production by immobilized photosynthetic bacteria. The system was compared with a flat panel reactor and found to offer a larger illumination area while at the same timing decreased the actual light intensity in the photobioreactor thus allowing for better light penetration. The maximum hydrogen production rate, 3.8mmol/m2/h and hydrogen yield, 0.75mol H2/mol glucose, were at least 75% higher than a flat panel reactor with light conversion efficiency of 3.8% (Zhang et al., 2010). Thus, it would appear that the grooved structure supports a wider surface area, useful for biomass enrichment and light penetration, and therefore causing an increase in hydrogen production efficiencies. Dark fermentation studies have shown that addition of solid carriers, such as activated carbon, expanded clay, silica particles, into the fermentation broth can markedly enhance cell growth and H2 production (Lee et al., 2004). This technique was applied to phototrophic hydrogen production by R. palustris WP3–5 by the addition of activated carbon, silica gel expanded clay (all at 2% w/v) to a 2g COD/L acetate containing medium. Internal (optical fibers) and external light sources (halogen and tungsten lamps) with light intensities of 95W/m2 were used. A production rate of 26mL/L/h and yield of 2.34mol H2/mol acetate were achieved with clay and silica gel. Scanning electron microscopy suggested that the cells were attached on carrier surfaces as a biofilm. Also, some of the carriers, in particular clay, appeared to stimulate bacterial growth. Using a clay system under continuous culture conditions with acetate (1g COD/L), a hydrogen production rate of 44mL H2/L/h and a yield of 3.56mol H2/mol acetate yield were achieved at an HRT of 36h (Chen and Chang, 2006). Thus, carriers, like immobilized cell systems, can enhance cell retention in continuous cultures thereby avoiding cell wash-out while operating at high dilution rates. Similar to immobilized systems, carrier assisted systems may also increase the performance of photobioreactors. In conclusion, achieving practical photofermentative hydrogen production will probably require that the process operate continuously. Cell immobilization is a useful technique that can be relatively easily applied for continuous hydrogen production and appears to offer some superior properties in comparison with suspended cell cultures. Both gel entrapment and biofilm techniques have been widely applied. As discussed above, each system has specific advantages and disadvantages. Although entrapment systems have an advantage in being able to create a specialized local environment which might be more favorable for efficient product formation, surface attachment may be a better approach to cell immobilization since efficiency is the critical issue. Up till now, hydrogen production studies with immobilized photofermentation systems have been mainly conducted using pure substrates. Future studies should examine the effect of immobilization on hydrogen production from real world substrates, i.e. various waste streams. Immobilization can greatly enhance hydrogen production capacity by increasing the effective biomass concentration, giving smaller reactor volumes and higher efficiencies. Using renewable substrates with immobilized systems would appear to be a promising way to achieve an economical and sustainable process of biological hydrogen production."
10,Conclusion and future prospects,"Photofermentative hydrogen production is a promising route for biohydrogen production. Photofermentative bacteria can use a wide variety of organic substrates as feed stock which is readily obtainable from renewable sources, especially organic industrial and agricultural wastes. For one-stage processes, the concentration and color of the feeding solution present major problems, necessitating dilution with consequent increases in operational costs in addition to the already relatively large costs associated with the pre-treatment and sterilizing operations. Thus at present, two-stage systems seem to be good options which allow treatment in a first step by dark fermentation of higher concentrations of feedstock without sterilization. However, nutrient concentrations in the first stage effluent solutions can be problematic. In practice, important nutrients may need to be added or dilution may be required to prevent inhibitory effects. Since adding synthetic compounds could cause unacceptable increases in the costs of the photofermentation process, addition of the necessary nutrients using other renewable sources as co-substrate could be an economically viable solution. Another important method for increasing process performance is cell immobilization. Among the two techniques most widely used, biofilm formation and entrapment, biofilm formation has been found to be more effective than entrapment. Surface attachment methods could enhance biomass concentration thus increasing hydrogen production efficiencies. As well, immobilization can reduce bioreactor size, thus reducing the required illumination area and consequently the economical costs. Finally adapting these systems to the use of renewable sources for substrates may lead to the future practical economic application of photofermentation to biohydrogen production."
