0,Introduction,"Selective conversion of biomass-derived alcohols into valuable chemicals has becoming a significantly promising and important research hotspot in heterogeneous catalysis [1–3]. Especially, selective conversion of biomass-derived alcohols into carbonyl compounds, usually considered as a greatly crucial functional group transformation reaction, is of critical importance in modern industrial process for synthesizing fragrances, fine chemicals, vitamins and drugs [1–6]. Traditionally, selective conversion of biomass-derived alcohols into carbonyl compounds, generally achieved by thermal catalysis and plagued by harsh conditions (e.g., high pressure and high temperature) [1–6], is typically occurred in organic solvents and usually catalyzed using poisonous stoichiometric or moisture-sensitive oxidants, e.g., V(V), Cr(VI), Mn(VII), peroxides, ozone or halides [3–6]. Although it can achieve high selectivity and high conversion simultaneously, the adopted oxidants are not only toxic and expensive compounds but also generate copious quantity of hazardous wastes (e.g., organic solvents and residual oxidants) [3–6], potentially causing serious toxicity and environmental pollution issues against basic principles of green chemistry. Within this context, it is urgently needed to explore an environment-benign and advanced strategy for selective conversion of biomass-derived alcohols into carbonyl compounds efficiently. Fortunately, heterogeneous photocatalysis has been widely regarded as an effective and environment-benign alternative to traditional thermal catalysis for green organic synthesis in the 21st century [7–12], which often takes place under mild conditions without employing toxic oxidants or harmful solvents, while its challenging bottleneck is how to construct highly active photocatalysts based on deep understanding of the catalytic mechanism. To date, significant achievements have been consequently made in the burgeoning research to develop highly active photocatalysts with visible-light responses, e.g., metal or nonmetal-doped TiO2, g-C3N4, CdS, WO3, BiVO4, Ag3PO4, Bi2WO6, Bi2MoO6, and graphene-based semiconductors [10–19], intentionally aiming to make use of solar energy much more efficiently. Especially, monoclinic WO3 with a distorted ReO3-type construction, commonly known as an n-type semiconductor with intrinsic energy band gap of ca. 2.6 eV [11], has been widely regarded as one promisingly suitable candidate because of its prominently physicochemical performances and multifarious applications in thermal catalysis, photocatalysis and electrolysis [11,12,20–22], which possesses the visible-light harvesting ability and then further makes it much more suitable for photocatalysis. Nevertheless, monoclinic WO3 is usually tortured by its relatively poor photocatalytic performance owning to the rapid photoelectron-hole recombination rate and the limited light-harvesting ability [11,12,20–22], which inevitably restricts its potentials in practical applications severely. Consequently, several approaches to ameliorate the above limitations have been adopted to endow monoclinic WO3 with highly enhanced photocatalytic performance, e.g., metal or nonmetal-loading and heterojunction construction [22–24], while the optimized photocatalytic performance isn’t yet still satisfactory because of uncontrollable spatial distribution, easy leaching and limited amounts of metals, nonmetals or heterojunctions. Alternatively, two effective approaches (e.g., morphological modulation and defect engineering) have been developed in recent years to enable monoclinic WO3 with highly enhanced photocatalytic performance [11,12,25–28]. On the one hand, the morphological modulation often plays the decisive role in tailoring the photocatalytic performance of monoclinic WO3, mainly due to the evidence that its photocatalytic performance is strongly related to its exposed facet, shape and nanostructure [11,12,20,29–32]. For example, Zhao et al. revealed that monoclinic WO3 octahedra with exposed (111) facets showed superior photoreduction efficiency to irregular-shaped WO3 particles in removing toxic heavy metal ions from waste water [29]. Miyauchi et al. discovered that monoclinic WO3 porous nanotubes demonstrated a significant enhancement in photocatalytic acetaldehyde decomposition compared to commercial WO3 particles [30]. Ye et al. reported that hierarchical monoclinic WO3 hollow shells, e.g., dendrites, microspheres and dumbbells, all exhibited higher photocatalytic activities in RhB degradation than commercial WO3 particles, especially hierarchical monoclinic WO3 hollow microspheres [31]. Yu et al. further proved that monoclinic WO3 hollow microspheres dramatically improved the photocatalytic activity in decolourizing RhB aqueous solution [32]. On the other hand, defect engineering such as introducing oxygen vacancies or creating low-valence metal centers also plays a versatile role in regulating the photocatalytic performance of monoclinic WO3, especially the oxygen vacancies [25–28,33–36]. It is generally accepted that oxygen vacancies can not only favorably benefit the intrinsic energy band gap narrowing via forming a miniband just below the conduction band to extend the photoresponse region and thus, greatly boost the light-harvesting ability [12,25,26], but also can function as the electron sinks to trap photoelectrons and restrain their recombination probability with holes and thus, significantly exalt the photoelectron-hole separation ability [10,12,25,26]. For example, Wang et al. attested that introducing oxygen vacancies into monoclinic WO3 nanoflakes showed an order of magnitude enhanced photocurrent density in photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation [28]. Durrant et al. further confirmed the improved photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation performance of monoclinic WO3 thin films by introducing oxygen vacancies [33]. Xiong et al. disclosed that creating oxygen vacancies in monoclinic WO3 nanosheets demonstrated a significantly 6 times enhanced kinetic rate in triggering photocatalytic aerobic couplings of amines to imines [34]. Lou et al. revealed that monoclinic WO3 nanowire bundles with abundant oxygen vacancies led to a remarkably 16 times enhanced photocatalytic activity in ethylene production from ethanol dehydration [35]. Zhang et al. verified that the oxygen vacancies in monoclinic WO3 nanoparticles played a critical role in greatly enhanced photothermocatalytic acetaldehyde degradation efficiency [36]. Despite great achievements have been made in regulating the photocatalytic performance of monoclinic WO3 by either morphological modulation or defect engineering, hierarchical hollow WO3 microspheres with tailored surface oxygen vacancies have been not yet still reported for photocatalytic selective conversion of biomass-derived alcohols to carbonyl compounds so far. Against the above background, hierarchical hollow WO3 microspheres with tailored surface oxygen vacancies, facilely synthesized through a solvothermal combining ion-exchange procedure followed by H2-treatment for the first time, have been implemented to catalyze selective conversion of biomass-derived alcohols into carbonyl compounds under mild conditions, e.g., aqueous medium, high-purity O2 atmosphere and Xe lamp irradiation with light wavelength of λ ≥ 400 nm. As expected, this photocatalyst presents the significantly boosted photocatalytic performance in terms of selectivity and activity, majorly attributing to the strong synergetic effect of hierarchical spherical cavity and surface oxygen vacancies simultaneously that led to the improved light-harvesting ability via multiple light reflections, the intrinsic energy band gap narrowing and the boosted photoelectron-hole separation efficiency. Meanwhile, this photocatalyst also demonstrates excellent reusability because of its stable crystal phase and robust hierarchical cavity against distinct deactivation, showing its promising potential in practical applications. This work sheds light on a new application of hierarchical WO3 microspheres with tailored surface oxygen vacancies and its strong synergetic effect of hierarchical structures and surface oxygen vacancies on photocatalytic performance, delivering new insights for rationally designing highly active photocatalysts applied in future green and sustainable organic transformation reactions."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis The hierarchical hollow WO3 microspheres with tailored surface oxygen vacancies were fabricated through a facile solvothermal combining ion-exchange procedure followed by H2-reduction treatment, according to previous researches with minor modifications [11,37]. The H2-reduction treatment is usually recognized as a universal method for creating oxygen vacancies in many photocatalysts (e.g., TiO2, WO3, ZnO, BiVO4, and BiPO4) [25,26]. Briefly, the spherical PbWO4 precursor (see Fig. S1) was initially prepared as follows: a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave containing 380 mg PbAc2·3H2O, 330 mg Na2WO4·2H2O, 365 mg cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and 50 mL ethylene alcohol was maintained for 12 h at 160 °C, then solid precipitation was collected and dried in air atmosphere for 6.0 h at 60 °C to acquire spherical PbWO4 precursor. Subsequently, 460 mg spherical PbWO4 precursor was completely immersed into a 120 mL 4.0 mol/L HNO3 aqueous solution under static condition for 48 h, then collected and dried in air atmosphere for 12 h at 60 °C, finally annealed in air atmosphere at 350 °C for 2.0 h to obtain the hierarchical hollow WO3 microspheres, which was labeled as HWM. After that, 500 mg HWM was annealed in a 50 mL/min flow of 20% H2/N2 at 350 °C for different hours (e.g., 0.25 h, 0.50 h, 1.0 h, 2.0 h and 3.0 h), and the resulting product was labeled as HWM0.25, HWM0.5, HWM1.0, HWM2.0 and HWM3.0. For comparison, the crushed HWM1.0 was also achieved through manually grinding HWM1.0 in an agate for 20 mins."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The crystal phase and crystal structure were obtained using a Rigacu D/Max-2000 powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument with CuKα radiation under testing conditions, e.g., 40 kV tube voltage, 30 mA tube current and 2θ value range of 20°-45°. Raman spectra achieved on a HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution instrument was performed at room temperature using a primary 532 nm visible-light laser. The oxygen vacancy analyzed on a Bruker EXMPLUS electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) instrument was carried out at the liquid N2 temperature (−196 °C) without using light irradiation. The morphological microstructures taken on JEOL JEM-2100 high resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) instrument and Hitachi-S4800 field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) instrument were operated at the 200 kV and 5.0 kV accelerating voltages, respectively. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms performed on a Micromeritics ASAP-2460 instrument were measured at the liquid N2 temperature (−196 °C), degassing at 150 °C for 10 h in vacuum with a 10 °C·min−1 heating ramp before analysis, where average pore diameter (D P) and pore volume (V P) together with specific surface area (S BET) were respectively acquired from the desorption branches using Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) methods. All chemical valence states of surface elements characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were recorded on a PerkinElmer PHI-5000C instrument using AlKα radiation and then charge-calibrated using the 284.6 eV signal of contaminated carbon C1s. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–Vis DRS) was achieved using a MC-2530 instrument with high-purity BaSO4 as the reference standard and light wavelength ranging from 250 nm to 800 nm. The photoelectron-hole separation ability was evaluated using photoluminescence spectroscopy (PLS) performing on a Varian Cary-Eclipse 500 instrument with a 370 nm excitation wavelength. The photoelectrochemical measurements were achieved on an electrochemical workstation (Model CHI-660E, CH instrument) using a standard three-electrode electrochemical setup, e.g., the Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, the Pt foil as the counter electrode and the sample electrode as the work electrode obtained via depositing 10 mg sample onto FTO conduction glass. The electrochemical system containing 0.50 mol/L Na2SO4 aqueous solution was irradiated using a 300 W Xe arc lamp (CEL-HXF300, CEAULIGHT Co., Ltd) with visible-light wavelength of λ ≥ 400 nm."
4,Photocatalytic activity evaluation,"2.3 Photocatalytic activity evaluation The activity evaluation by performing selective conversion of biomass-derived alcohols into carbonyl compounds was achieved using a self-made quartz reactor (see Fig. S2) containing 10 mL D.I·H2O, 0.10 g photocatalyst and 0.10 mmol biomass-derived alcohols or their derivatives. For ensuring the employed enough oxygen gas to catalyze biomass-derived alcohols or their derivatives to produce carbonyl compounds, the volume of self-made quartz reactor is fixed at 100 mL. Typically, the reaction system was degassed and saturated with high-purity O2 atmosphere (1.0 atm), and all reactions were proceeded under continuous stirring at 25 °C and irradiated by a 300 W Xe arc lamp (CEL-HXF300, CEAULIGHT Co., Ltd) with visible-light wavelength of λ ≥ 400 nm at 15 cm away from the reaction solution. The capturing experiments of active species with the assistance of different scavengers, e.g., benzoquinone, diphenylamine, terephthalic acid, and methanol acting as the corresponding scavenger of superoxide radicals (·O2 –), photoelectrons (e-), hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and photogenerated holes (h+), respectively, were performed the same to the above photocatalytic reactions expect that 20 mmol different captures were added into reaction system. The reaction products after reacting 6.0 h were thoroughly extracted with diethyl ether, then carried out qualitative identification using GC–MS instrument (Agilent GC–MS, 6890 N/5973I-GC/MSD) and quantitative analysis using GC instrument (Shimadzu GC-2014, TB-1 column, FID)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical characteristics,"3.1 Physicochemical characteristics The morphology and microstructure of all the photocatalysts were firstly characterized using FESEM and TEM. From Fig. 1 , it can be intuitively observed that all the photocatalysts exhibited the uniform hierarchical microspheres with hollow interiors. The average diameter and the shell thickness of the hollow microspheres were calculated at approximately 3.0 um and 400 nm, respectively. Interestingly, the shells of the hollow microspheres were roughly textured and comprised of numerous closely self-interconnected sheet-like units within nanoscale dimensions, e.g., 40 nm in thickness, 300 nm in length and 180 nm in width, obviously constructing a highly porous architecture. Importantly, the morphology and microstructure of all the photocatalysts had no visual difference significantly and kept almost unchanged after H2-treatment as compared with H2-untreated WO3 (HWM), regardless of different H2-treated hours. Correspondingly, their TEM images in Fig. 2 almost showed the same microspherical diameter distribution and structural characteristics of HWM and HWM1.0 as revealed by FESEM characterization. In addition, the distinct contrast between the interior cavity and the porous shell also confirmed that the structural essence of HWM and HWM1.0 was well-defined uniform hierarchical hollow microspheres. Their magnified TEM images further disclosed that the porous shells were indeed constructed by the self-assembly of copious closely interconnected nanosheet-like units, which can be fairly corroborated by the evidence that the crushed HWM1.0 (Fig. S3) purely contained nanosheet-like units. The attached SAED images clearly indicated that they had the polycrystalline characteristics together with excellent crystallization degrees. The d-spacing value of the interplanar lattice in their HRTEM images were readily estimated at approximately 0.376 nm, which was intrinsically assigned to the principal (020) crystal plane of monoclinic WO3 crystal phase [11,37], distinctly revealing that the nanosheet-like unit mainly exposed the (020) facet. Notably, compared to HWM, a disordered layer with thickness about 1 ~ 3.0 nm on the nanosheet-like fringe of HWM1.0 was clearly observed, mainly resulting from the oxygen abstract by hydrogen during the H2-treated process and potentially demonstrating a huge number of oxygen vacancies on the photocatalyst’s surface [38,39]. The N2 sorption isotherms in Fig. 3 were then applied to characterize the textural properties of all the photocatalysts. Clearly, it can be seen that all the N2 sorption isotherms were congruously classified as the characteristic type-IV category of N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms according to the IUPAC definitions [10,11,40,41]. Notably, an H3 hysteresis loop in all the N2 sorption isotherms was located among the relative pressure (P/P 0) value range of 0.85–1.0, implying the existence of the silt-shaped porous structures that were often related to the nanosheet-like particles [11,40,41], well coinciding with the self-interconnected nanosheets as evidenced by TEM and FESEM characterizations. Interestingly, no saturated adsorption of all the N2 sorption isotherms was completely achieved until the relative pressure (P/P 0) value reached approximately 1.0, clearly indicating the existence of partial macropores and large mesopores in all the photocatalysts [11,40–43]. This conjecture can be distinctly evidenced by their respective pore size distribution curve, in which a relatively wide pore size distribution ranging from 2.0 to 50 nm could be fairly observed, majorly attributing to the copious self-interconnected nanosheet-like units. According to N2 sorption isotherms, the textural properties of all the photocatalysts, e.g., S BET, D P and V P, have been calculated via BET and BJH models from the desorption branches, respectively, and the corresponding data has been summarized in Table 1 . Notably, compared to HWM, the S BET of all the photocatalysts gradually decreased from HWM0.25 to HWM3.0 along with the increase in the H2-treated hours, while the D P of all the photocatalysts demonstrated a reverse trend to the S BET together with the nearly unchanged V P, which could be mainly due to the reason that the thermal effect produced from the H2-treated process inevitably promoted the growth of the crystalline grains as revealed by the following XRD characterization. The crystalline grain size and crystal phase of all the photocatalysts have been subsequently analyzed using XRD characterization. Obviously, the XRD patterns in Fig. 4 disclosed that all the photocatalysts could be well identified to the typical monoclinic WO3 crystal phase (JCPDS Card No.83-0950) together with the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 23.1°, 23.6°, 24.4°, 26.6°, 28.6°, 34.2° and 41.9° corresponding to the (002), (020), (200), (120), (112), (202) and (222) facets [11,37], respectively. Besides, no foreign diffraction peaks were found, indicating the high purity of all the photocatalysts. Furthermore, it’s clearly observed that the intensity of typical diffraction peaks became stronger slightly and their half-peak width became narrower gradually with continuously increasing H2-treated hours as compared with HWM, indicating the gradual increase in the crystallization degree [10–12]. According to the principal (020) peaks of XRD patterns, the crystalline grain size has been calculated on the basis of Scherrer’s equation. From Table 1, compared to HWM, it can be obviously seen that the crystalline grain size increased gradually from HWM0.25 to HWM3.0 with increasing the H2-treated hours, further validating the gradual improvement in the crystallization degree. Additionally, the magnified 2θ value ranging from 22° to 25° distinctly showed that the principal (002), (020) and (200) peak positions of all the H2-treated photocatalysts gradually red-shifted to the high angle along with the increased H2-treated hours in comparation with HWM. This observation can be mainly correlated with the residual stress coming from the oxygen abstract by hydrogen during the H2-treated process that led to the lattice shrinkage [10,44,45]. Furthermore, it is well-known that the oxygen abstract by hydrogen favorably promoted the formation of surface oxygen vacancies on the photocatalysts [38,39], well agreeing with the HRTEM characterized results. For confirming the formation of surface oxygen vacancies on the photocatalysts, Raman spectra in Fig. 5 a has been carried out to provide solid evidences. Typically, all the photocatalysts exhibited four major peaks situated at 272, 327, 707 and 806 cm−1 corresponding to the characteristic monoclinic WO3 crystal phase [12,21], which were almost unanimous with XRD characterization. Briefly, two former peaks located at 272 and 327 cm−1 were correspondingly associated with the O-W-O bending vibration modes, while other two later peaks centered at 707 and 806 cm−1 were readily assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric O-W-O stretching vibration modes [12,21], respectively. Interestingly, compared to HWM, the intensity and half-peak width of these four major peaks in all the photocatalysts became weaker and broader gradually from HWM0.25 to HWM3.0 with the increase in the H2-treated hours as compared with HWM, obviously demonstrating a reverse order to the varied crystallization degree as disclosed through XRD characterization. This observation is majorly ascribed to the fact that Raman characterization is indeed sensitive to surface structure whereas XRD characterization reflects the bulk structure of materials [12]. In addition, the gradual weakening in the intensity and broadening in the half-peak width of all the photocatalysts from HWM0.25 to HWM3.0 signified the gradual increased concentration or number of surface oxygen vacancies as compared to HWM. To further ascertain the essence of oxygen vacancies intuitively, EPR spectroscopy in Fig. 5b was also adopted to characterize all the photocatalysts, mainly attributing to the fact that it is a sensitive and direct method to differentiate the kinds of oxygen vacancies, e.g., surface oxygen vacancies or bulk oxygen vacancies. Clearly, it can be seen that all the photocatalysts displayed a strong and sharp EPR signal peak located at a g-value of approximately 2.003, which could be mainly attributed to the Zeeman effect of the single electron captured at the sites of surface oxygen vacancies [10,44], clearly confirming that they were surface oxygen vacancies instead of bulk oxygen vacancies in all the photocatalysts. Moreover, in view of previous studies [10,44,46], the concentration or number of surface oxygen vacancies could be proportional to the intensity of EPR signal peak. Clearly, one can see that the intensity of EPR signal peaks significantly increased in all the photocatalysts from HWM to HWM3.0, readily validating the increased concentration or number of surface oxygen vacancies. The surface atomic composition and microenvironment of all the photocatalysts were meticulously examined using XPS technique. The XPS surveys in Fig. S4 showed that all the photocatalysts merely contained O and W atoms and no foreign atoms could be found, confirming that all the photocatalysts were of high purity. The high-resolution W4f spectrum in Fig. 6 a exhibited that all the photocatalysts had two major peaks indicative of the W4f5/2 and the W4f7/2 with high and low binding energies [10,12], respectively. Notably, the signals of W6+ and W5+ were distinctly found by subsequently deconvoluting W4f spectrum through Gaussian fitting-plot methods. Distinctly, two strong peaks in W4f spectrum with respective binding energy centered at approximately 35.7 and 37.7 eV were originated from the high oxidation valence state of characteristic W6+ cations, whereas other two weak peaks with respective binding energy located at around 34.9 and 37.2 eV represented the low oxidation valence state of typical W5+ cations [10,12]. Generally, it is believed that the existence of characteristic W5+ cations hinted the formation of oxygen vacancies in all the photocatalysts [10,12], which benefited the significantly improved oxygen mobility on the surface of photocatalysts and further inevitably favored the oxidation reactions in many heterogeneous catalytic processes. Meanwhile, the high-resolution O1s spectrum in Fig. 6b was deconvoluted into two peaks with respective binding energy centered at about 531.6 and 530.1 eV, representing the surface chemisorbed oxygen (Oads) species (e.g., O2 2–, O2 –, OH– or O-) and lattice oxygen (OL) species [10,12,47–49], respectively. In view of previous studies [47–50], the concentration or number of surface oxygen vacancies could be proportionally reflected by the relative peak intensity of surface chemisorbed oxygen (Oads) species. Apparently, the relative intensity of Oads peak slightly increased from HWM to HWM3.0, suggesting the gradually increased concentration or number of surface oxygen vacancies. According to the above-mentioned XPS analysis, the chemical valence states and quantitative surface atomic compositions of all photocatalysts were calculated and presented in Table 1. Obviously, one can see that the W5+/W6+ molar ratio of all the photocatalysts remarkably increased from HWM to HWM3.0, mainly attributing to the reason that the increased H2-treated hours inevitably prolonged the contact time between hydrogen gas and photocatalyst and thus, in turn improved the reductive ability, thereby making the reduction of W6+ cations to W5+ cations much more easily. Besides, the Oads/OL molar ratio also gradually increased from HWM to HWM3.0, which demonstrated the similar order to the varied W5+/W6+ molar ratio and further indicated the increased concentration or number of surface oxygen vacancies in all photocatalysts, well coinciding with the EPR and Raman characterized results. This finding can be majorly due to the fact that the formation or generation of surface oxygen vacancies was directly originated from the reduction of W6+ cations to W5+ cations. The photocurrent transient response of all the photocatalysts has been studied by photoelectrochemcial measurements using Xe lamp irradiation with light wavelength of λ ≥ 400 nm, which is generally considered as an indirect method to reflect the generation and separation ability of photogenerated electron-hole pairs [10–12]. From Fig. 7 , one can clearly see that the photocurrent transient response could be immediately generated over all the photocatalysts when Xe lamp irradiation was switched on, and then decreased instantly to zero if Xe lamp irradiation was switched off, firmly validating that all the photocatalysts acted as semiconductors to generate photoelectrons with the assistance of Xe lamp irradiation [9–12]. Meanwhile, it can be observed that the photocurrent transient intensity initially increased remarkably from HWM to HWM1.0, then declined significantly from HWM1.0 to HWM3.0. Hence, HWM1.0 irrefutably exhibited the strongest photocurrent transient intensity under present conditions, suggesting its highest photoelectron-hole separation ability [9–12]. Based on the XRD and Raman characterizations, it can be acknowledged that all the photocatalysts were in the form of pure monoclinic WO3 crystal phase, thus the varied photocurrent transient intensity of all the photocatalysts was mainly caused by their differentiations in the light-harvesting ability and the photoelectron-hole separation ability [9–12]. Consequently, the light-harvesting ability about all the photocatalysts was evaluated using UV–vis DRS measurements as presented in Fig. 8 a. Notably, we can obviously see that HWM presented a relatively sharp absorption edge at approximately 474 nm corresponding to the intrinsic energy band gap of approximately 2.62 eV of typical monoclinic WO3 crystal phase, well coinciding with previous researches [11,12,51]. Apparently, the absorption edge of all the photocatalysts red-shifted gradually to the longer wavelength until reaching 517 nm from HWM0.25 to HWM3.0, distinctly attesting the boosted light-harvesting ability and the gradual intrinsic energy band gap narrowing [10,26]. Meanwhile, compared with HWM, all the photocatalysts presented a significantly huge absorption tail in visible-light range of 480–800 nm, mainly attributing to the formation of surface oxygen vacancies as evidenced by previous researches [10,12,23,26]. Importantly, the intensity of the absorption tails increased dramatically from HWM0.25 to HWM3.0, further affirming the increased concentration or number of surface oxygen vacancies and well agreeing with the Raman and EPR characterized results, which also further corroborated the boosted light-harvesting ability. In addition, the intrinsic energy band gap related to all photocatalysts has been calculated using Kubelka-Munk function according to the typical equation of (ɑhʋ)n = c(hʋ - E g), in which n, ɑ, ʋ, h, c and E g were directly related to the respective indirect gap semiconductor (n = 1/2), absorption coefficient, light frequency (3.0 × 108 m·s−1), Planck’s constant (4.136 × 10-15 eV·s), a constant (c = 1) and the intrinsic energy band gap [10,44,51]. As shown in Fig. 8b, one can distinctly see that the calculated intrinsic energy band gap related to all the photocatalysts decreased gradually from 2.61 eV to 2.39 eV corresponding to the photocatalysts from HWM to HWM3.0, fairly attesting the intrinsic energy band gap narrowing, which was mainly caused by the fact that the formation of a miniband just below the conduction band induced by surface oxygen vacancies (see Scheme 1 ). The formation of a miniband just below the conduction band not only favored the intrinsic energy band gap narrowing and thus broadened the photoresponse in visible-light region but also made use of visible lights much more efficiently, finally promoting the improved light-harvesting ability significantly [10,25,26]. Additionally, the structural characteristics of all the photocatalysts, e.g., the hierarchical spherical cavity and the self-interconnected nanosheets on the spherical shells [11,52–54], also benefited the enhancement in the light-harvesting ability via multiple light reflections not only in the hierarchical spherical cavity but also among the self-interconnected nanosheets as depicted in Scheme 1. This speculation can be indirectly evidenced by the fact that the crushed HWM1.0 demonstrated lower light-harvesting ability than intact HWM1.0 (see Fig. S5) due to its destroyed hierarchical structure unfavoring the multiple light reflections. Besides the light-harvesting ability, the photoelectron-hole separation ability of all the photocatalysts was also investigated using PLS characterization, which is usually recognized as a direct method to reflect the photoelectron-hole separation ability in semiconductor photocatalysts [9–12,51]. As shown in Fig. 8c, it can be apparently seen that the relative intensity of PLS emission peak initially decreased remarkably from HWM to HWM1.0 indicative of the enhancement in the photoelectron-hole separation ability [9,10,12,52,53], and then increased gradually from HWM1.0 to HWM3.0 corresponding to the gradual decrease in the photoelectron-hole separation ability [10–12], well coinciding with the varied order in the photocurrent transient intensity as revealed by photoelectrochemical measurements. Therefore, HWM1.0 can be considered as the optimal photocatalyst with the highest photoelectron-hole separation ability, signifying its superior catalytic performance in heterogeneous photocatalytic applications. It should be pointed out that the enhanced photoelectron-hole separation ability from HWM to HWM1.0 was mainly ascribed to the increased concentration or number of surface oxygen vacancies, which can function as electron sinks to trap photoelectrons and thus, retard their recombination probability with photogenerated holes, inevitably benefitting the enhanced photoelectron-hole separation ability [10,12]. Notably, the crystalline grain size from HWM to HWM1.0 also increased significantly from 11 nm to 19 nm. It is generally accepted that the increase in the crystalline grain size often had adverse effect on improving the photoelectron-hole separation ability [10,11], due to the reason that the large crystalline grain size prolonged the transfer distance of photoelectrons and in turn improved the recombination probability of photoelectron-hole pairs. This finding seemed contradictory to the enhanced photoelectron-hole separation ability from HWM to HWM1.0, which can be explained that surface oxygen vacancies rather than crystalline grain size played the decisive role in determining the photoelectron-hole separation ability under present conditions. Nevertheless, both HWM2.0 and HWM3.0 exhibited lower photoelectron-hole separation ability than HWM1.0 even they owned higher concentration or larger number of surface oxygen vacancies, possibly ascribing to the fact that their excess number of surface oxygen vacancies could become the photoelectron-hole recombination centers and in turn further inhibit their separation from each other severely [10,12,25,26]. Meanwhile, their larger crystalline grain sizes also unfavorably promoted the separating photoelectrons from photogenerated holes owning to the fact that the larger crystalline grain size extended the transfer distance of photoelectrons and then improved the recombination probability of photoelectron-hole pairs."
7,Photocatalytic performances,"3.2 Photocatalytic performances The photocatalytic performances of all the photocatalysts have been evaluated using selective conversion of biomass-derived alcohols (e.g., 1-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol as the representative biomass-derived alcohols) into carbonyl compounds as the model reactions under mild conditions, e.g., in aqueous medium, in high-purity O2 atmosphere and Xe lamp irradiation with light wavelength of λ ≥ 400 nm. Before the performance evaluation, the underlying catalytic mechanism of selective conversion of biomass-derived alcohols into carbonyl compounds is firstly investigated over HWM1.0 based on the active species captured using different scavengers. Meanwhile, control experiments revealed that no measurable reaction products of both1-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol were found without using either photocatalyst or Xe lamp irradiation, and the conversions of 1-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol were achieved both less than 7.0% in the high-purity N2 atmosphere instead of high-purity O2 atmosphere. Thus, it can be concluded that photocatalytic selective conversion of biomass-derived alcohols into carbonyl compounds can be only occurred in the co-existence of three prerequisite factors, e.g., photocatalyst, Xe lamp irradiation and high-purity O2 atmosphere. In addition, the result of qualitative analysis using GC–MS disclosed that no side-products rather than carbonyl compounds in selective conversion of both 1-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol were detected under present test conditions, indicating the excellent selectivity of the target carbonyl compounds. As shown in Fig. 9 , one can clearly see that no significantly varied reaction conversions of both 1-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol could be found once terephthalic acid was added into reaction system and acted as the scavenger of hydroxyl radicals (·OH) [9–12], firmly attesting that the hydroxyl radicals (·OH) didn’t act as the major active species involved in the reaction process. Importantly, significant decreases in reaction conversions of both 1-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol were observed once either methanol, benzoquinone or diphenylamine was added into reaction system as the corresponding scavenger to capture holes (h+), superoxide radicals (·O2 –) and photoelectrons (e-) [9–12], respectively. Furthermore, remarkable declines in reaction conversions of both 1-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol were also achieved by introducing high-purity N2 atmosphere into reaction system to completely remove the dissolved O2 atmosphere. Therefore, taking into account the above-mentioned solid results, it can be affirmed that the major active species involved in present selective conversions of both 1-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol were indeed the photogenerated holes (h+), superoxide radicals (·O2 –) and photoelectrons (e-) rather than the hydroxyl radicals (·OH). It should be pointed out that the superoxide radicals (·O2 –) can’t be theoretically formed by O2 reduction over WO3 due to its more positive potential (+0.23 eV) than superoxide radicals (·O2 –) formation (-0.33 eV). However, the superoxide radicals (·O2 –) are really formed under present conditions since the capturing experiment of superoxide radicals (·O2 –) regardless of 1-phenylethanol or benzyl alcohol has been recycled at least for three times and the experimental results remain almost the same. This phenomenon could be possibly attributed to the reason that surface oxygen vacancies might act as the “electron bridge” to transfer photoelectrons to react with the adsorbed O2 molecules to produce superoxide radicals (·O2 –), due to the fact that O2 molecules can be preferably adsorbed at the sites of surface oxygen vacancies [34,38,55–57]. The real reason of superoxide radicals (·O2 –) formation over WO3 is in progress. Accordingly, a photocatalytic mechanism of selective conversion of biomass-derived alcohols into carbonyl compounds has been tentatively proposed and concisely described in Scheme 1 and Eqs. (1)–(6). Initially, the hierarchical hollow WO3 microspheres with tailored surface oxygen vacancies generated the photoelectron-hole pairs under Xe lamp irradiation as expressed in Eq. (1). Subsequently, the photogenerated holes (h+) stayed in the valence band (VB) could attack and activate the biomass-derived alcohol molecules of 1-phenylethanol or benzyl alcohol absorbed on the photocatalyst’s surface to generate their corresponding biomass-derived alcohol cation radicals, e.g., 1-phenylethanol cation radicals or benzyl alcohol cation radicals [10–12], according to Eqs. (2) and (3). At the same time, the photoelectrons (e-) directly transferred to the conduction band from the valence band and the miniband, then activated and reacted with the O2 atmosphere involved in reaction solution to form superoxide radicals (·O2 –), distinctly expressing in Eq. (4). Finally, superoxide radicals (·O2 –) attacked and reacted with the corresponding biomass-derived alcohol cation radicals of benzyl alcohol cation radicals or 1-phenylethanol cation radicals to produce the final carbonyl compounds, e.g., benzaldehyde or acetophenone, following the Eqs. (5) and (6). The photocatalytic performance of all the photocatalysts has been subsequently evaluated using selective conversions of 1-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol as the biomass-derived alcohols into the corresponding acetophenone and benzaldehyde, respectively. From Fig. 10 , we can clearly see that the reaction conversion remarkably increased initially from HWM to HWM1.0 and then declined significantly from HWM1.0 to HWM3.0, regardless of 1-phenylethanol or benzyl alcohol. Therefore, HWM1.0 can be indeed accepted as the optimal photocatalyst in catalyzing selective conversions of 1-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol into their corresponding acetophenone and benzaldehyde under present reaction conditions. According to the aforementioned characterizations and the obtained performance data, it can be concluded that the superior photocatalytic performance of HWM1.0 was mainly due to the strong synergetic effect of the hierarchical spherical cavity and the surface oxygen vacancies simultaneously. On the one hand, the hierarchical spherical cavity together with highly porous shells, substantially constructed by the copious self-interconnected nanosheets, favorably benefitted the rapid diffusion and adsorption of reactant molecules through the porous shells [11]. Meanwhile, the hierarchical spherical cavity, usually acted as a micro-reactor in heterogeneous catalytic reactions [11,52], not only provided a confined homogeneous environment in the internal cavity for photocatalytic reactions but also favored the prolonging contact time between reactant molecules and photocatalysts, thereby greatly enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Importantly, the hierarchical spherical cavity also benefited the significantly boosted light-harvesting ability via multiple light reflections not only in spherical cavity but also among the self-interconnected nanosheets [11,53,54], inevitably allowing much more effective utilization of light source and thus promoting the improved photocatalytic activity dramatically. This can be fairly attested by the evidence that the crushed HWM1.0 demonstrated lower conversions of both benzyl alcohol (36%) and 1-phenylethanol (42%) than intact HWM1.0 due to its destroyed structure and weaker light-harvesting ability (see Fig. S5). On the other hand, surface oxygen vacancies could lead to the intrinsic energy band gap narrowing via forming a miniband just below the conduction band (CB) induced by surface oxygen vacancies, which indeed broadened the photoresponse in visible-light region and made the utilization of visible lights much more efficiently, finally improving the light-harvesting ability remarkably. Meanwhile, surface oxygen vacancies often functioned as electron sinks to trap photoelectrons (e-) and in turn restricted their recombination probability with photogenerated holes (h+), thus enhancing the photoelectron-hole separation ability significantly. Furthermore, previous researches have revealed that surface oxygen vacancies had considerable localized electrons, which could serve as the active sites for adsorbing or activating reactant molecules [10,55,56], then surface catalytic reactions could be occurred once reactant molecules adsorbed onto the sites of surface oxygen vacancies, further promoting the improvement in photocatalytic performance. Moreover, many previous studies have also attested that surface oxygen vacancies can favor the enhanced adsorption and activation of O2 molecules to take part in the photocatalytic oxidation process due to the fact that O2 molecules can be preferably adsorbed at the sites of surface oxygen vacancies and thus, promote photocatalytic oxidation [34,38,55,56]. It should be pointed out that, compared to HWM1.0, both HWM0.25 and HWM0.5 together with HWM presented lower photocatalytic activities, even they had larger surface area and smaller crystalline grain size than HWM1.0 that favored the adsorption of reactant molecules and reduced the transfer distance of photoelectrons (e-), respectively, mainly due to their inferior light-harvesting ability and less number or lower concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. However, both HWM2.0 and HWM3.0 possessed higher concentration or larger number of surface oxygen vacancies and higher light-harvesting ability than that of HWM1.0, but they still exhibited inferior photocatalytic activities than HWM1.0. This observation can be majorly due to their extremely lower surface area and bigger crystalline grain size, which unfavored the adsorption of reactant molecules and extended the transfer distance of photoelectrons (e-) and then inevitably improved their recombination with holes (h+) and thus, greatly decreased the photoelectron-hole separation ability, respectively. Meanwhile, previous reports have substantiated that the excess concentration or number of surface oxygen vacancies would become the photoelectron-hole recombination centers and in turn suppress their separation from each other and thus, significantly decrease the photoelectron-hole separation ability [10,12,25,26], which could be also mainly associated with the lower photocatalytic activities of HWM2.0 and HWM3.0. To explore the universal application, the optimal photocatalyst of HWM1.0 has been adopted to catalyze a series of benzyl alcohol and 1-phenylethanol derivatives to carbonyl compounds under the same reaction conditions in the subsequent experiments. As listed in Table 2 , the experimental results indicated that HWM1.0 still kept excellent conversions of different derivatives, regardless of 1-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol, clearly presenting its promising universal application. Interestingly, it can be clearly observed that the p-H atoms of both 1-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol substituted by electron-donating groups (e.g., p-OCH3 and p-CH3) exhibited higher conversions than those substitutions using electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., p-NO2, p-Br, p-Cl and p-F) over HWM1.0, well coinciding with previous reports [9–12,58,59]. This finding was mainly associated with the fact that electron-donating groups enabled the moieties of –CHOH-CH3 and –CH2OH with higher electron cloud density than those electron-withdrawing groups, and then the photogenerated holes subsequently attacked and reacted with the moieties of –CHOH-CH3 and –CH2OH to form their cation radicals much more easily [10,12,59]. Simultaneously, this observation further corroborated the rationality of photocatalytic mechanism for selective conversion of biomass-derived alcohols into carbonyl compounds as depicted in Scheme 1. The optimal photocatalyst of HWM1.0 has been also selected to explore its reusability, which is generally considered as an important evaluating indicator in future practical application. During the reusability testing process, HWM1.0 was thoroughly separated by centrifugation from reaction solution once each reaction finished, and then completely rinsed using D.I·H2O and absolute ethanol for several times. To ensure each photocatalytic selective conversion reaction conducting under the same testing conditions, fresh reaction solution must be recharged into the reused HWM1.0 in the subsequent recycling test. As shown in Fig. 11 , one can clearly see that HWM1.0 can be recycled at least six times and no appreciable deactivation was found in the photoactivities for selective conversion of biomass-derived alcohols into carbonyl compounds, regardless of 1-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol, since their conversions kept almost unchanged during the six times recycling test process, distinctly demonstrating the excellent reusability and promising potential in future application. The excellent reusability of HWM1.0 could be correlated with its robust hierarchical spherical cavity and stable crystal phase against distinct deactivation according to the evidence that its morphology and crystal phase of HWM1.0 still kept perfect nearly and no visual difference could be found after the sixth reused test as shown in Fig. S6."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, hierarchical hollow WO3 microspheres with tailored surface oxygen vacancies have been facilely fabricated through a solvothermal combining ion-exchange strategy followed by subsequent H2-treatment for the first time, which presented the dramatically improved photoactivity in catalyzing selective conversion of biomass-derived alcohols into carbonyl compounds under mild conditions. The dramatically improved photocatalytic activity can be majorly correlated with the strong synergetic effect of hierarchical spherical cavity and surface oxygen vacancies simultaneously, leading to the boosted light-harvesting ability via multiple light reflections, the intrinsic energy band gap narrowing and the improved photoelectron-hole separation ability. Meanwhile, this photocatalyst also exhibited excellent reusability because of its stable crystal phase and robust hierarchical spherical cavity against distinct deactivation, presenting its significantly promising potential in future green organic synthesis. This work sheds light on a new application of hierarchical WO3 microspheres with tailored surface oxygen vacancies and its strong synergetic effect of hierarchical structures and surface oxygen vacancies on photocatalytic performance, delivering new insights to rationally design highly active photocatalysts applied in future green and sustainable organic transformation reactions."
