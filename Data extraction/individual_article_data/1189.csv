0,Introduction,"To alleviate the current trend in air pollution and global warming due to the combustion of fossil fuels, the development of alternative clean energy has become a critical issue in our society. Bioenergy is considered to be a promising strategy of renewable-energy form because of its sustainability through growth of energy crops from sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. Biological hydrogen is recognized to be an ideal bioenergy, because it has a high specific energy content (122kJ/g), generates only water when burned, and may be produced biologically via fermentation of potential renewable materials such as carbohydrates-containing biomasses and various organic wastes. Because the waste reduction and renewable energy production can be achieved at the same time, fermenting biohydrogen from organic wastes has been investigated with many source materials, e.g. municipal waste fractions (De Gioannis et al., 2013), cellulose (Ratti et al., 2013), domestic wastewater (Van Ginkel et al., 2005), lipid-extracted microalgae (Yang et al., 2011), dairy wastewater, and food waste (Jo et al., 2008). The varied compositions and material characteristics in organic wastes and wastewaters pose challenges in investigation because a variety of substrates may be utilized by different species of microorganisms (Whang et al., 2006; Rafrafi et al., 2013). Another practical issue of biohydrogen fermentation is the limitation in the yield of 4mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose (Thauer et al., 1977), which responds only 33% of the conversion as compared to the theoretical maximum yield of 12mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose based on the complete conversion of glucose to H2 and CO2. The low yield is likely a consequence of the tendency of microorganisms to produce biomasses and of the competing reactions that consume hydrogen or divide it into other end-products (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002). In practice, hydrogen yield is related to the metabolic pathways and the end-products distribution; for example, the butyrate-to-acetate ratio (B/A ratio) and the lactate production are found to be related to the hydrogen yield. Unfortunately, detailed mechanisms were not clear at this moment. The other metabolites produced during hydrogen fermentation also indicates that a certain amount of COD in wastes or wastewaters remains not digested, and thus a post methanogenic process may be used to recover the remaining potential energy content (Hallenbeck, 2009). The two-stage anaerobic bioprocess has been demonstrated for many advantages, including selection and enrichment of different functional microorganisms (Zhang and Noike, 1991), reduction of the effect of pH change (Anderson et al., 1994), higher overall degradation efficiency than single methane fermenter (Kubler and Schertler, 1994), and improved net energy production than single hydrogen fermenter (Ruggeri et al., 2010). In the present study, a two-stage bioprocess was employed to recover the bioenergy from bagasse bioethanol residues, since approximate 20–25% of COD may remain in residues after bioethanol fermentation (BEFR). The main objective of this study was to recover bioenergy in the forms of H2 and CH4 while treating bagasse BEFR through the two-stage bioprocess. Two bioreactors were operated at different HRT and substrate concentrations to evaluate the performance in H2 and CH4 production. Batch experiments were also conducted to further evaluate the effects of substrate concentration and biomass concentration on biohydrogen fermentation. The variation of metabolites under different operational conditions was found correlated to hydrogen production performance, and the possible mechanisms for the positive relationship between B/A ratio and hydrogen yield were discussed. Finally, the overall bioenergy recovery and COD removal efficiency from bagasse BEFR using the two-stage bioprocess were also evaluated."
1,Methods,
2,Operation of the two-stage bioprocess,"2.1 Operation of the two-stage bioprocess Two bioreactors, i.e. hydrogen fermentation bioreactor (HFB) and methane fermentation bioreactor (MFB), were operated in this study as a two-stage bioprocess. The total volume of the glass-made HFB and the MFB were 5 and 12L with a working volume of 2 and 8L, respectively. Both bioreactors were equipped with a magnetic stirrer for mixing. A complete-mix condition was achieved for the HFB at an agitation speed of 160rpm, while a gentle mixing was applied for the MFB at an agitation speed of 30rpm. Both bioreactors were kept in an incubator in order to maintain an operational temperature at 37°C. The first bioreactor, HFB, was fed with organic residues obtained from a bioethanol fermentation process (i.e. bioethanol fermentation residues, BEFR) using bagasse as the substrate. Table 1 summarizes the wastewater characteristics of bagasse BEFR investigated in this study. As shown in Table 1, the residues contained a total COD of 31,000mg/L, which consisted of carbohydrate (8700mg/L), organic acids (3700mg/L of lactate and 4500mg/L of acetate) and alcohols (1800mg/L of ethanol). The following chemicals as growth nutrients (in mg/L) were added to the BEFR before the latter was fed into the HFB (Whang et al., 2011): CaCl2·6H2O, 32.3; MgCl2·6H2O, 232; KCl, 168; MnCl2·4H2O, 63.9; CoCl2·6H2O, 3.87; H3BO3, 0.74; CuCl·2H2O, 0.35; Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.33; ZnCl2, 0.27; FeCl2·4H2O, 10.6; sodium thioglycolate, 217; KH2PO4, 119. Sodium ammonia (400mg-N/L) and peptone (360mg/L) were added as nitrogen sources, and a trace amount of resazurin (0.175mg/L) was also added as the redox-status indicator. The second bioreactor, MFB, was fed with the effluent collected from the HFB. Both bioreactors were kept in incubators in order to maintain an operational temperature at 35°C. The influent feeds to both bioreactors, including bagasse BEFR and effluent of the HFB, were stored at 4°C in a refrigerator and fed from there into the bioreactors continuously using a peristaltic pump. The oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) and pH were monitored for both bioreactors during operation. The pH values for hydrogen and MFB were controlled at 6 and 7, respectively, throughout the experiments via a pH controller using 45% H3PO4 and 50% NaOH. The amount of biogases produced from both bioreactors was measured with a wet-gas flow meter (Shinagawa W-NK-0.5B, Tokyo, Japan). The seeding microorganisms for both the HFB and the MFB were obtained from a lab-scale bioenergy recovery process for treating cellulosic BEFR (Cheng et al., 2012). The operational conditions of the HFB and MFB are summarized in Table 2 A and B, respectively. Based on the predetermined operational conditions for hydraulic retention time (HRT) and feed concentration, the volumetric loading rates (VLRs) for the HFB increased gradually from 19 to 180kgCOD/m3/day, while for the MFB, the VLR varied between 2.4 and 3.7kgCOD/m3/day."
3,Batched fermentative biohydrogen tests,"2.2 Batched fermentative biohydrogen tests The batched fermentative biohydrogen tests conducted in this study was a modified version of the biochemical methane potential test originally developed by Owen et al. (1979). The test was carried out in a series of 1L glass bottles equipped with pH-controlling and gas-collection devices with the working volume of 800mL. Predetermined concentrations of bagasse BEFR were firstly mixed with nutrients and added to the bottles as the fermentation substrate. Biomass was taken from the HFB and centrifuged at 6000rpm for 5min, and the supernatants were discarded. The solids, as the seeding of the batch experiments, were then resuspended in the bottles containing 800mL of the substrate. The bottles were flushed with oxygen free nitrogen gas before being capped tightly with rubber septum stoppers. The bottles were incubated at 37°C in a water bath tank equipped with magnetic stirrers rotating at 120rpm. The pH of the mixed liquor was automatically controlled between 5.8 and 6.0 by feeding with either NaOH (10%) or H3PO4 (5%). The total volume of gases produced during batch experiment was determined by water displacement method, and the gas composition was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC). Liquid samples were frequently taken throughout the batch experiments for determining the concentration of alcohols and organic acids using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The concentrations of soluble components (such as xylose, acetate, butyrate, ethanol, and butanol) were analyzed using a HPLC (Hitachi D2000 system, Japan) with an ICSep COREGEL-87H3 column (Transgenomic, USA) and a refraction index detector (Hitachi Chromaster 5450, Japan). The eluent used was 0.008N sulfuric acid at a flow rate of 0.6mL/min and the column temperature was controlled at 42°C. Biogas was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (China GC 8900, Taipei, Taiwan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A 2m stainless column was packed with Hayesep Q (60/80 mesh) and installed in a 60°C oven. The operational temperature of the injection port was set at 90°C, while the operational temperatures of the oven and the detector were set at 60°C. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 15mL/min. The carbohydrate concentration was analyzed following the phenol–sulfuric acid method as described in previous study (Cheng et al., 2012). The pH, oxidation–reduction potential (ORP), and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured according to the standard methods (APHA, 1998)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Performance of the hydrogen fermentation bioreactor,"3.1 Performance of the hydrogen fermentation bioreactor The performance of the HFB, which was divided into 9 runs according to the operational conditions as shown in Table 2, are summarized in Table 3 . During this study, pH was maintained between 5.8 and 6.0 for the HFB, and ORP ranged from −297 to −467mV with an average of −360±45mV. The HFB achieved consumption efficiency for carbohydrates in the range of 82–93% during this study. The highest efficiency of 93% was attained in the Run 3 when the bioreactor was operated at a volumetric loading rate (VLR) of 33kgCOD/m3/day. For the operational conditions investigated, the biomass concentrations of the HFB increased with an increased VLR. For the performance of hydrogen production, including specific rate and yield, results from the Run 1 were the worst among all conditions, despite that carbohydrate consumption of Run 1 was nearly 90%. The highest hydrogen yield of 8.24mL/gCOD was achieved in Run 7–2, while a specific hydrogen production rate of 37.6mL/gVSS/h attained in Run 9 was the highest. The soluble metabolites in the HFB effluent at different conditions are also shown in Table 3. During the operation, xylose was completely utilized and only a low concentration of lactate was detected, except that a moderate level of xylose and relatively high concentration of lactate were detected in the Run 9 at a HRT of 4h. It is reported that the metabolic flux toward lactate formation at low HRT and is peaked when the HRT reached 4h (Cheng et al., 2013), which is closed to the doubling time of hydrogen producing bacteria (Whang et al., 2011). Among these measured metabolites, acetate and butyrate were the major soluble end products observed in the HFB, while ethanol and propionate were the minor end products. It has been indicated that higher B/A ratio corresponds to better hydrogen production performance (Lee and Rittmann, 2009; Whang et al., 2011; Cheng et al., 2012), and in the present study, the maximal B/A ratio was found to be 0.43 with a hydrogen yield of 7.11mL/gCOD in Run 8. Improved hydrogen yields were also observed from Run 6–1 to Run 6–2 and from Run 7–1 to Run 7–2, and B/A ratios were also increased at the same periods."
7,Batched fermentative biohydrogen tests at different S 0/X 0 ratio and X 0,"3.2 Batched fermentative biohydrogen tests at different S 0/X 0 ratio and X 0 Batch fermentative biohydrogen tests were conducted to evaluate the hydrogen production potential using the sludge taken from the HFB during the Run 2 with a minimum hydrogen production and the Run 7–1 with an improved hydrogen production. Accumulated hydrogen production was monitored during both fermentative biohydrogen batch experiments at different initial substrate-to-biomass ratios (S 0/X 0) and initial biomass concentrations (X 0). Fig. 1 presents the results of batch experiments using sludge from Run 2, where a highest hydrogen yield of 20.8mL/gCOD was detected when S 0/X 0 was 23.3gCOD/gVSS within 50h. Hydrogen production observed during batch experiments suggested that the sludge from the Run 2 could potentially produce hydrogen from BEFR, although no gas was produced by HFB during the Run 2. The results of batch experiments using sludge from the Run 7–1 are illustrated in Fig. 2 , where a highest hydrogen yield was 39.9mL/gCOD when S 0/X 0 was 27.6gCOD/gVSS. In both batch experiments, hydrogen production was not observed when S 0/X 0 was lower than 16.2gCOD/gVSS or above 41.8gCOD/gVSS, or when initial substrate (S 0) was higher than 25.5gCOD/L, indicating that S 0/X 0 (or F/M ratio) is an important factor for hydrogen production from the bioreactor fed with BEFR. A higher hydrogen production has been observed with a higher substrate addition, but a higher S 0/X 0 ratio also causes a longer lag-phase for hydrogen evolution (Liu and Shen, 2004). This observation agreed with the batch experimental results observed in this study. In comparison of the two sets of batch experiments using the sludges from two different runs, the sludge from the Run 7–1 under a shorter HRT (9h) and a higher VLR (80kgCOD/m3/d) attained a higher hydrogen yield. It is reported that methanogenesis or acetogenesis could be minimized at a short HRT operation (Cheng et al., 2012; De Gioannis et al., 2013). It is likely that the longer HRT (18h) operation in the Run 2 was attributed to an unfavorable condition for hydrogen production in the HFB due to promotion of acetogenesis. As a result, hydrogen consumption via acetogenesis may occur in the HFB and lead to a low hydrogen yield of 0.28mL/gCOD in the Run 2."
8,Metabolism of fermentative biohydrogen from BEFR,"3.3 Metabolism of fermentative biohydrogen from BEFR During anaerobic fermentation of carbohydrates such as glucose and starch, several volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols were produced as major primary metabolites, depending on microorganisms and environmental conditions of the bioreactor (Gottschalk, 1986). According to the metabolic pathways and stoichiometric relationships proposed for anaerobic glucose fermentation, hydrogen production is accompanied with the production of acetate and butyrate, but not with the production of formate, propionate, and lactate (Ljungdahl et al., 1989). For the fermentative biohydrogen test with S 0/X 0 =27.6gCOD/gVSS and X 0 =16.3gCOD/L, the concentration profiles of xylose and soluble metabolites were monitored during the batch experiment as shown in Fig. 3 . Xylose was rapidly consumed in the first 5h of experiment without any delay, but only small amount of hydrogen was produced. Accompanied with xylose consumption, noticeable amount of lactate and acetate were produced. After 15h, butyrate was also produced with a significant production rate. During the rapid production of butyrate, substantial amount of lactate and small amount of acetate were consumed, accompanied with a large amount of hydrogen production at the same period. This pattern differed from those previously proposed for fermentative hydrogen production from glucose, but it seemed to agree with the pathway that was discussed for hydrogen production from lactate and acetate (Balows, 1992; Matsumoto and Nishimura, 2007). In hydrogen bioreactors fed with maltose- or xylose-containing BEFR, Juang et al. (2011) and Cheng et al. (2012) noted that carbohydrates were utilized mainly for the production of biomass, lactate, and acetate, while hydrogen and butyrate production occurred with the utilization of lactate and acetate. Although this metabolism is not the major pathway mentioned for fermentative biohydrogen, lactate and acetate utilization accompanied with butyrate and hydrogen production has been discussed. Previous studies have observed possible connection between hydrogen production and lactate/acetate utilization, and mentioned that some Clostridium species were able to utilize lactate/acetate to hydrogen (Balows, 1992). By examining isolated Clostridium diolis, Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium beijerinckii from a slurry, Matsumoto and Nishimura (2007) concluded that these species can produce hydrogen from utilization of lactate and acetate. Clostridium tyrobutyricum was recognized to utilize lactate/acetate for hydrogen production (Jo et al., 2008) and to be the dominant hydrogen-producing bacteria in a continuous flow stirred tank reactor (CSTR) fed with lactate and acetate (Wu et al., 2012). Furthermore, in a summary of the proposed stoichiometric equations, Cheng et al. (2012) has suggested that for approximately 1mol of lactate and 0.35–0.5mol of acetate utilized, 0.5–0.65mol of hydrogen and 0.6–0.83mol of butyrate are formed."
9,The relationship of B/A ratio and hydrogen yield,"3.4 The relationship of B/A ratio and hydrogen yield The B/A ratio, the molar ratio of butyrate and acetate, is an effective indicator for evaluating the hydrogen yield, with a higher B/A ratio corresponding to a higher hydrogen yield (Lee and Rittmann, 2009; Whang et al., 2011). The correlation between the hydrogen yield and the B/A ratio found in the hydrogen bioreactor is presented in Fig. 4 , as well as the results from previous studies treating BEFR from tapioca (Juang et al., 2011) and rice straw (Cheng et al., 2012). In general, the correlation between the hydrogen yield and the B/A ratio observed in this study shared the similar trend found in previous studies, showing a positive correlation. It was noted that the results obtained in Cheng et al. (2012) and in this study shared a more comparable slope comparing to that derived from Juang et al. (2011). In addition, a much higher B/A ratio was also observed in Juang et al. (2011). This discrepancy is presumed due to the different carbohydrates presented by BEFRs, in which maltose was the major sugar in tapioca BEFR while xylose was the major sugar in rice straw and bagasse BEFRs. A recently study also indicated that the optimal B/A ratio, ranging from 1.3 to over 4.0, varied with the culture, temperature, and substrate conditions (Lee et al., 2014). According to the theoretical stoichiometry of glucose for fermentative hydrogen production, 4mol or 2mol of hydrogen are produced by converting 1mol of glucose to 2mol of acetate or 1mol of butyrate, respectively. This stoichiometry indicates a decrease in the B/A ratio corresponding to an increase in hydrogen yield, but apparently disagrees with the correlation between the hydrogen yield and the B/A ratio shown in Fig. 4. In addition to thermodynamic and metabolic considerations for biohydrogen production (Lee and Rittmann, 2009), two possible mechanisms have been proposed for the commonly observed higher hydrogen yield at a higher B/A ratio condition, especially in systems fed with organic wastes for mixed cultures (Cheng et al., 2012). The first mechanism involves the metabolism of lactate and acetate for butyrate and hydrogen production observed in the current and previous studies. It is suggested that consumption of acetate and lactate for production of butyrate and hydrogen can occur in anaerobic fermentation processes, leading to a higher hydrogen yield at a higher B/A ratio condition. The second mechanism is the H2 and CO2 or butyrate consumption for acetate production through the acetogenesis. In this study, two sets of hydrogen fermentation batch experiments were conducted using sludge from the Run 2 and Run 7–1, respectively. In 6 of the 11 total batch experiments, increased acetate was observed after hydrogen production ceased, as shown in Fig. S1. These observations suggested that acetogenesis may occur in the HFB, and thus according to the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, hydrogen was used to reduce carbon dioxide for acetate production (Lee et al., 2010). Indeed, a loss of the produced gas in the later phase of our batch experiments was noted, which is consistent with the finding from a previous work that the decrease in hydrogen yield was correlated with the increase in acetate level (Baghchehsaraee et al., 2008). Fig. 5 presents hydrogen yield with observed butyrate and acetate concentrations in the three hydrogen bioreactors fed with tapioca (Juang et al., 2011), rice straw (Cheng et al., 2012), and bagasse BEFRs. It was apparent that a lower hydrogen yield occurred at acetate concentration above 70mM, suggesting that the acetate level was a key factor for hydrogen production. Therefore, conditions minimizing acetogenesis during hydrogen production, such as the reduction of HRT or appropriate pretreatment of the complicated substrate, could be critical to a high hydrogen-producing bioreactor."
10,Performance of the methane fermentation bioreactor and overall bioenergy recovery from the two-stage bioprocess treating BEFR,"3.5 Performance of the methane fermentation bioreactor and overall bioenergy recovery from the two-stage bioprocess treating BEFR In the MFB, the methane-producing microorganisms utilized organic matters from the effluent of the HFB and produced methane gas. The performance of the MFB at different operational conditions is summarized in Table 4 . In general, the MFB was able to attain a COD removal efficiency above 75%, with the highest COD removal efficiency of 83% observed in Run 4. Indeed, methane gas, being the major product of the biogas produced, accounted for around 70% of produced gases in all experimental runs. In summary, the methanogens enriched in the bioreactor were able to convert organic acids, mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate, to methane gas, but the optimized VLR for the MFB required further investigation. The results of electron distribution, in the form of COD, during fermentation processes in the HFB and the MFB are summarized in Table 5 . In the HFB, 0.3% of COD in the bagasse BEFR was converted to hydrogen gas, and the remaining COD in the HFB effluent was used as feed for the MFB. Previous study indicated that about 10–20% of available electrons in carbohydrates could be utilized for hydrogen formation (Thauer et al., 1977). Using complicated organic substrates for hydrogen production in this and previous studies, however, less than 5% of available electrons could be recovered as hydrogen gas as indicated in Table 5. It is likely that using complicated organic substrates, different metabolic pathways producing other volatile fatty acids (i.e. lactate, butyrate, acetate, and propionate) and solvents (ethanol) might be the reason for a lower hydrogen yield. In the current study, acetogenesis occurring in the HFB may be another possibility for the lower hydrogen yield and should be minimized by operation optimization. In the MFB, 72.8% of COD in bagasse BEFR was recovered as methane gas and 7.9% of COD were converted to biomass, with remaining 3.1% of COD in the effluent. The remaining COD in the MFB effluent included 1.1% of carbohydrate, 0.2% of acetate, and 1.8% of propionate. In summary, the two-stage bioprocess for bagasse BEFR treatment attained a COD removal of 81%, which was comparable with those reported in other studies, ranging from 65% to 95%."
11,Conclusion,"A two-stage bioprocess, combining HFB and MFB, was employed for recovering H2 and CH4 from bagasse BEFR treatment. Approximate 90% of carbohydrate in bagasse BEFR was converted to VFAs and hydrogen in the HFB, in which hydrogen production performance was greatly influenced by VLR and S 0/X 0. A positive correlation between hydrogen yield and B/A ratio was observed in the HFB, which might be due to the mechanisms of hydrogen production from lactate/acetate utilization and acetogenesis. Finally, a COD removal of 81% was achieved, among which 0.3% and 72.8% of COD were converted into the forms of H2 and CH4, respectively."
