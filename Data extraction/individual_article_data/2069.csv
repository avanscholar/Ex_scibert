0,Introduction,"Breast cancer 1 ( BRCA1 ) regulates DNA repair and protects against breast cancers arising in cells with homozygous (−/−) BRCA1 mutations or silenced BRCA1 expression [1,2]. Silencing/mutation of both Brca1 alleles also results in embryolethality [3]. Brca1 CNS-specific −/− KO mice are viable but exhibit impaired development of brain structures, resulting in ataxia and a shortened lifespan [4]. Thus, tissue-specific or global homozygous deficiencies in BRCA1 can respectively cause serious developmental disorders or lethality. We previously reported that heterozygous (+/−) Brca1 conditional knockout (KO) embryos exhibiting 28% lower BRCA1 develop normally, but when exposed in culture to ethanol (EtOH) exhibit enhanced DNA damage and embryopathies compared to wild-type (+/+) littermates [5]. In a standard KO model, saline-exposed +/− Brca1 KO embryos exhibiting 58% lower BRCA1 exhibited enhanced DNA damage in fetal brain and postnatal cognitive disorders, which were sustained or worsened by EtOH [6–8]. In human +/− BRCA1 subjects with varying mutations [9,10], DNA repair is slowed/halted [10–12]. Variable mutations in BRCA1 heterozygotes can result in different levels or functional efficacy of BRCA1 protein and DNA repair capacity [13]. During oxidative stress, proteins can be oxidized, enhancing their regeneration or removal mechanisms. Signaling proteins with essential roles in cell cycle progression, like BRCA1, contain intrinsically disordered sequences making them more susceptible to 20S proteasomal degradation [14]. Under oxidizing conditions, expression of the 20S proteasome is in part regulated by the ROS sensor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and constitutes the major protein degradation machinery [14–16]. EtOH-enhanced ROS formation has divergent concentration-dependent effects, with proteasomal activity being respectively enhanced and inhibited by low and high oxidative stress levels [17,18]. In utero EtOH exposure during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) [19], including growth retardation, craniofacial defects and impairment of executive function, motor coordination, visual-spatial abilities and learning and memory [20–22]. EtOH exposure can enhance ROS production via induction of NADPH oxidases (NOXs) [23,24], its CYP2E1-catalyzed metabolism [25], and via the regeneration of NAD+ for alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity [26–28]. NOXs produce superoxide anions [29], which participate in neural cellular signaling and in the immune response to pathogens [30,31]. EtOH-induced ROS enhancement can contribute to multiple cellular effects implicated in FASD mechanisms, including DNA damage [26], epigenetic changes [32–34], altered protein levels and modifications affecting signal transduction pathways [35,36] and cellular processes (e.g. apoptosis) [32]. Herein, a single in utero EtOH exposure, equivalent to 4–6 drinks [37], enhanced fetal and adult ROS production and depleted protective BRCA1 protein levels in fetal and adult brains, revealing a new mechanism by which EtOH initiates developmental disorders. BRCA1 depletion resulted from EtOH-enhanced proteasomal activity, and Brca1 expression was unaltered. Proteasomal enhancement was blocked by pretreatment with a free radical spin trap and ROS inhibitor [38,39], phenylbutylnitrone (PBN). NOX and catalase activities also were enhanced by EtOH exposure over a time course congruent with the reduction in BRCA1 protein and prevented by PBN pretreatment. Wild-type (+/+) Brca1 progeny but not +/− littermates exposed in utero to EtOH exhibited postnatal freezing behaviour in a conditioned fear study, prevented by PBN pretreatment, suggesting ROS-mediation. Even saline-exposed Brca1 +/− adults and progeny exhibited increased baseline brain NOX levels, revealing a new mechanism by which BRCA1 regulates ROS-dependent disorders, and enhances susceptibility to FASD."
1,Methods,
2,Animals,"2.1 Animals Animal studies were conducted in accordance with Canadian Council on Animal Care standards and were approved by the institutional Animal Care Committee. Up to 4 +/− Brca1 KO mice (01XC4; RRID: IMSR_NCIMR:01XC4; National Institute of Health, Frederick, MD [40]) were housed per cage in light- and temperature-controlled rooms (14 h light/10 h dark cycle, 20 °C, 50% humidity) with corn bedding. Teklad 18% protein rodent chow (Harlan Laboratories, Mississauga, ON) and tap water were provided ad libitum. Mating and treatments are detailed in the supplementary data."
3,Genotyping,2.2 Genotyping Brca1 [41] and sex [42] genotyping were performed as described in available protocols. DNA extraction and PCR details are indicated in the supplementary data.
4,NOX activity,"2.3 NOX activity NOX activity was assessed as previously described [23,43], with some modifications indicated in the supplementary data."
5,Catalase activity,"2.4 Catalase activity Catalase activity was assessed as previously described [44,45], with some modifications indicated in the supplementary data."
6,20S proteasomal activity,"2.5 20S proteasomal activity Activity of the 20S catalytic core was measured by fluorometric assay (MAK172, Millipore Sigma), where details are indicated in the supplementary data."
7,BRCA1 protein,"2.6 BRCA1 protein BRCA1 protein levels were measured via western blotting performed as described in Drake et al. [46], and detailed in the supplementary data."
8,Brca1 expression,"2.7 Brca1 expression RNA extraction and RT-qPCR protocols were performed as described previously [47], using primers validated in +/+ Brca1 fetal brains. Details are outlined in the supplementary data."
9,Freezing behaviour,"2.8 Freezing behaviour Learning & memory was assessed by passive avoidance as described previously [48], with additional observation of freezing behaviour. Details are outlined in the supplementary data."
10,Statistical analyses,"2.9 Statistical analyses Data for fetal brains from the same litter for each genotype and treatment group were averaged and analyzed using the number of litters per group as the experimental unit. Sex differences were not observed for any assessments, so male and female data were combined for statistical analysis using Prism, Version 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Differences in Brca1 expression and protein levels, and proteasomal, NOX and catalase activities, were evaluated by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests at each timepoint. NOX and proteasomal activities over time were assessed by linear regression, where Pearson correlation coefficients (R2) values > 0.9 indicated a good fit and slopes were compared using the F-statistic (Supplementary data, Tables S1 and S2). Freezing behaviour was analyzed by the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, and which group displaying freezing behaviour was unknown until the data were analyzed. Group comparisons were evaluated at the 5%, 2-tailed probability level."
11,Results & discussion,"Fetal and adult brains exhibited similar levels of superoxide production by NOX enzymes (Fig. 1 A–C). However, Brca1 +/− fetal and adult brains exhibited enhanced NOX activity relative to +/+ littermates and adults, independent of treatment and time post-exposure. This corroborates reciprocal relationships between BRCA1 expression and (a) NOX subunits observed in tissues from patients with different cancers [49]; and, (b) in vitro ROS levels [50]. NOX activity was increased by EtOH in adult and fetal brains of both genotypes 6 h post-treatment (Fig. 1A&B), and returned to baseline within 24 h. EtOH was previously shown in the embryo to increase NOX activity [23], and enhanced NOX subunit expression in fetal brains [24]. PBN reduced NOX activity in both the saline and EtOH exposure groups (Fig. 1A&B). The ability of PBN to block the EtOH-initiated transient enhancement of NOX activity is consistent with its ROS inhibiting effects observed previously [38,39,51,52]. However, enhanced NOX activity in +/− vs. +/+ fetal brains was retained at 24 h post-treatment (Fig. 1C). The enhanced NOX activity in +/− Brca1 brains may contribute to their greater sensitivity to oxidative DNA damage and warrants further investigation in saline-exposed progeny to determine the pathogenic potential of physiological ROS levels when DNA repair is compromised. Full data sets over time are shown in Supplementary data Fig. S1. Activity of the antioxidative enzyme catalase is regulated by the ROS sensor NRF2 [53]. In addition to detoxifying hydrogen peroxide, catalase can participate in the metabolism of EtOH in peroxisomes [54], although demonstrating a negligible effect on maternal plasma alcohol concentrations [55]. In fetal and adult brains 6 h post-exposure, +/− Brca1 progeny demonstrated elevated catalase activity compared to +/+ littermates and adults (Fig. 1D). This enhancement of antioxidative protection in Brca1 +/− brains follows a similar pattern to NOX activity. However, EtOH exposure did not upregulate catalase activity in the adult brains, and it abolished the genotype difference observed in saline-exposed adult mice. Catalase activity in fetal brains was only 38% of that in adult brains (Fig. 1D&E) which, along with fetal NOX activity being similar to adult levels, likely contributes to the greater susceptibility of fetal brain to ROS. Unlike in adult brains, catalase activity was enhanced in +/− Brca1 fetal brains by in utero EtOH exposure 6 h following exposure. However, the enhancement of this antioxidative enzyme in fetal brains was not sufficient to block the ROS-mediated effects on proteasomal activity and BRCA1 protein level, nor ethanol-induced freezing behaviour observed herein. The EtOH-induced enhancement of catalase activity was also blocked by PBN pretreatment, suggesting ROS-mediation of catalase induction (Fig. 1E). All elevated levels of catalase activity observed 6 h post-EtOH exposure returned to baseline (saline +/+ levels) by 24 h post-exposure, revealing a transient treatment effect (Fig. 1F). EtOH enhanced proteasomal activity in both Brca1 +/+ and +/− fetal brains. This EtOH-induced enhancement was blocked by PBN pretreatment, implicating a ROS-mediated mechanism (Fig. 2 B). The EtOH-initiated enhancement in proteasomal activity evident at 6 h was not observed at 24 h post-exposure (Fig. 2C). The 6 h treatment effects observed in the fetal brain were also observed in the adult (Fig. 2A), where proteasomal activity was enhanced following EtOH exposure and blocked by PBN pretreatment. Proteasomal activity was not assessed in adult brains 24 h post-exposure. Full data sets over time are shown in Supplementary data Fig. S2. The time course for this EtOH-enhanced activity coincided with that for the reduction in BRCA1 protein levels, which are typically maintained by expression and proteasomal degradation [56]. The levels of other proteins likely would also be reduced in response to this EtOH-induced enhancement of proteasomal activity. Furthermore, proteasomal activity can be differentially influenced by the level of oxidative stress, where small amounts may enhance activity to remove oxidatively damaged proteins, and large amounts may damage the proteasome itself, impairing function [17,18]. BRCA1 protein levels in fetal and adult brains of saline-exposed Brca1 +/− mice were lower than in +/+ littermates and adults (Fig. 3 A&B). In vivo exposure to a single administration of EtOH reduced BRCA1 protein in fetal and adult brains of both Brca1 genotypes at 6 h, and levels returned to baseline within 24 h. In the brains of Brca1 +/+ fetuses and adult mice at 6 h post-exposure compared to 0 h (untreated mice), EtOH reduced BRCA1 protein to approximately +/− Brca1 brain levels. Similarly, in Brca1 +/− fetal and adult brains 6 h post-exposure, EtOH reduced BRCA1 by 79% and 88% compared to 0 h BRCA1 levels in Brca1 +/+ fetal and adult brains, respectively. This BRCA1 reduction may substantially compromise BRCA1-dependent processes including the repair of ROS-initiated DNA damage [6–8]. The developmental consequences of an increased BRCA1 deficiency may include altered division, differentiation [57], migration [58], function and survival of neural progenitor cells [4,59]. The BRCA1 reductions caused by EtOH in fetal and adult brains were blocked by PBN pretreatment, suggesting a ROS-mediated mechanism (Fig. 3A&B). Our results implicate NOX-catalyzed ROS production in the mechanism through which BRCA1 is degraded following EtOH exposure, where both were reduced by PBN pretreatment. Herein, Brca1 expression was lower as expected in saline-exposed +/− vs. +/+ fetal brains at 6 and 24 h. In immortalized cancer cell lines, BRCA1 was reported to be decreased by the effect of EtOH on Brca1 transcription [60]. In contrast, herein in vivo, EtOH did not alter Brca1 gene expression compared to saline controls in either genotype or at either timepoint following EtOH exposure (Fig. 3C&D). Accordingly, the substantial decrease in BRCA1 protein levels in both fetal and adult brains caused by a single administration of EtOH is consistent with a mechanism involving ROS-enhanced proteasomal degradation rather than reduced Brca1 gene expression. Transient postnatal freezing, a form of behavioural inhibition [61] was exhibited for up to at least 3 months postnatally by both male and female Brca1 +/+ progeny exposed once in utero to EtOH, but not by +/− littermates (Fig. 4 ). During the first trial at both 9 and 12 weeks of age, all Brca1 +/+ progeny exposed in utero to EtOH remained frozen for over 100 s (Supplementary data Fig. S3). The EtOH-initiated postnatal freezing behaviour in +/+ progeny was blocked by maternal PBN pretreatment, suggesting a ROS-mediated mechanism (Supplementary data Fig. S4). Similar blocking by PBN of molecular damage and postnatal behavioural disorders is observed in other DNA repair-deficient models [62], and may be due to increased DNA damage regulating signaling via epigenetic or direct mechanisms at physiological levels of ROS [63,64]. A relationship between anxiety-related disorders and ROS/oxidative stress has previously been established [65,66], where lowered antioxidative protection and enhanced oxidative macromolecular damage may characterize anxiety disorders [67]. These observations are consistent with the enhanced proteasomal activity and reduced BRCA1 protein observed in EtOH-treated mice herein. In previous fear conditioning studies, increasing shock strength was dose-dependently associated with increased freezing behaviour [68]. While the Brca1 +/+ mice might be uniquely sensitive to the shock, it seems more likely that the lack of freezing behaviour in the +/− Brca1 progeny constitutes a neurodevelopmental disorder that is detrimental to their survival. Recognition of danger induced by an electrical shock, and displaying anxious freezing behaviour, may be an appropriate response for the EtOH-exposed +/+ progeny. This freezing behaviour has been previously observed in fear conditioning assessments [69,70], and is a typical rodent response to predators like cats."
12,Conclusion,"This is the first in vivo study to demonstrate that EtOH induces a reduction in the level of BRCA1, and first report of enhanced baseline ROS-producing NOX activity in Brca1 +/− progeny. These two discoveries expand the known mechanisms by which BRCA1 regulates ROS-dependent disorders. The mechanism of BRCA1 depletion by EtOH involved enhanced global ROS-initiated proteasomal degradation, with no apparent involvement of altered Brca1 gene expression previously reported in cell culture [60]. In utero EtOH exposure caused a long-lasting ROS-dependent adaptive postnatal freezing behaviour in all Brca1 +/+ progeny that was lost in Brca1 +/− littermates, possibly exposing +/− progeny to enhanced predation. The ROS-mediated increase in proteasomal activity and BRCA1 reduction in both fetal and adult brains, compounded by the increased NOX activity revealed in BRCA1-deficient progeny, provide new insights into the mechanisms and risk factors underlying EtOH-initiated neurodevelopmental disorders."
