0,Introduction,"To overcome the fundamental problems caused by the consumption of fossil fuels, such as the rapid depletion of fossil fuels and the growing problems associated with environmental pollution, research on the production of new energy in recent years has been important and has become very popular among scientists. Due to its high energy density, high purity, sustainability, and eco-friendliness, hydrogen energy is considered a promising alternative [1–6]. Among the various methods of hydrogen production, alkaline electrochemical water splitting, which includes two reactions including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 4H2O + 4e− → 2H2 + 4OH−) at the cathode surface and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 4OH− → O2 + 2H2O + 4e−) at the anode surface is considered a promising and environmentally-friendly process [7–9]. The advantages of this method are the use of water as an unlimited source, high purity of produced hydrogen, and also not releasing toxic and dangerous gases [10–12]. Despite this method's advantages, it is not yet industrially usable because it requires much more potential than the thermodynamic potential of water electrolysis (1.23 V). High resistance such as polarization and bubble resistance in the water splitting process is the main reason for such high overpotential [13]. Hence, it is necessary to produce and generate electrodes that produce hydrogen and oxygen with the lowest potential and, therefore, the lowest cost on their surface [14,15]. At present, precious electrocatalysts such as Pt-based electrodes for HER and iridium or ruthenium-oxide based electrodes for OER have been considered state-of-the-art materials [16,17]. Unfortunately, due to their scarcity, high cost, and poor electrocatalytic stability, the use of these electrocatalysts in the commercial, industrial electrolyzer has many limitations [18]. Therefore, the development of cost-effective electrocatalysts with excellent activity and stability has been one of the most important research fields in recent years [19–27]. So far, many studies have been conducted to produce effective and cost-effective electrodes that include pure metals or alloys, transition metal phosphides, carbides, borides, and sulfides for HER [28–35] and metal oxides, hydroxides, and selenides for OER [36]. Between the two processes (OER and HER), the OER process, the oxidation of water, is a very complex and slow reaction that, despite the fabrication of high-activity electrocatalysts, has led to still need more than 1.5 V voltage in the overall water splitting process to generate the current density of 10 mAcm−2. In the OER process, first O-H bonds are broken, and then O-O bonds are formed in 4 steps [37,38]. Therefore, it can be said that OER is one of the most important limitations in water electrolysis systems for hydrogen production. One of the best methods to overcome this problem is to use an electrochemical reaction to replace the OER process with less oxidation potential. Researchers have shown that oxidation of methanol, ethanol, urea, benzyl alcohol, and hydrazine is thermodynamically more favorable than water oxidation, thus reducing the overall cell voltage and therefore the cost of producing the hydrogen [39–42]. Among the oxidative processes mentioned, hydrazine electro-oxidation is one of the most important candidates due to its high-power density and higher kinetics. The anodic reaction of hydrazine oxidation is as follows [43,44]. (1) N2H4 + 4 OH− → N2 + 4 H2O + 4e− E0 = -0.33 V vs. RHE As can be seen, the product of this reaction is nitrogen gas, which is harmless. So far, studies have been conducted to generate electrocatalysts for the HzOR process, in which the electrodes are mainly noble metals such as Pt, alloys, sulfides, selenides, and phosphides of transition metals [45]. In general, the production of electrodes in an electrochemical cell that can act as both cathodic and anodic reaction electrocatalyst will reduce the costs and simplify the design of the electrolysis system. Therefore, creating a bi-functional electrocatalyst for HER and HzOR processes can also increase the hydrogen production system's efficiency and is of great importance. Despite advances in the emergence of HER and HzOR process electrocatalysts, the fabrication of bi-functional electrocatalysts for HER and HzOR is still one of the most important challenges, and further studies and advances are needed. The most important strategies to solve this problem and the emergence of new electrocatalysts are the production of electrodes with new compounds that lead to the improvement of the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, as well as new architectures that increase the active surface area. Engineering the surface and electronic structure leads to greater exposure to electrochemical sites for electroactive species, simplification of intermediate electrochemical reactions, and leads to improved charge transfer and mass transfer processes. The results of experiments and theoretical studies have shown that the electrocatalytic performance of double compounds can be much better optimized and improved than single compounds. Adding a second alloying element to the structure leads to a change in the electrocatalytic electronic structure and thus leads to an improvement in the electrocatalytic activity. Among the various morphologies that can lead to an increase in the surface active area, micro-nano dendrites, due to their special structure, can lead to a kinetic increase in electrochemical processes and an improvement in mass transfer processes. Also, the method of electrode synthesis has a great impact on the activity and performance of the electrocatalyst. Using an affordable, simple, versatile, and binder-free process can be very effective and instructive. Electrochemical deposition as a cost-effective and binder-free method can be very effective in the synthesis of electrocatalysts. By changing the variables governing the process, it is possible to have precise control over the microstructure, morphology, chemical composition, and electrocatalytic activity. To the best of our knowledge, dendrite-like phosphide-based structures have been rarely used as electrocatalysts, and the Ni-Cu-P dendritic structure has not been seen in any studies as a bi-functional electrocatalyst for HER and HzOR processes. Based on the above challenges, it can be expected that the creation of Ni-Cu-P micro-nanodendrite could be an important step in the production of hydrogen assisted by the HzOR anodic reaction. The present study aims to synthesize the Ni-Cu-P electrocatalyst with dendrite-like structure using the electrochemical deposition method and then investigate its electrocatalytic activity as a bi-functional electrocatalyst for HER and HzOR processes in an alkaline environment."
1,Experimental section,
2,Electrode synthesize,"2.1 Electrode synthesize In this study, nickel foam was used as a substrate for catalyst deposition. Prior to deposition, the substrates were firstly degreased in acetone for 15 minutes under ultrasonic waves. The samples were then acid-washed for 20 seconds in 20% HCl solution to remove the surface oxide layers. Coating operations began immediately, as shown schematically in Fig. 1 , were performed in two steps. In the first step, Ni-Cu micro-nano dendrites were created using electrodeposition operation. In the second step, a nanometric layer of Ni-Cu-P was created on Ni-Cu nanostructures to create Ni-Cu-P nanostructures ultimately. The chemical composition of the Ni-Cu nanodendrite baths included 0.5 M NiSO4.6H2O, 0.01 M CuSO4.5H2O, 0.02 M (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 M HCl, and 1.5 M H2SO4. Also, the applied current density was 2 Acm−2, and the coating duration time was 4.8 min. The pH value of the bath was 1, and also the coating was operated at room temperature. At this stage, the graphite sheet was used as an anode. Second, the Ni-Cu-P nanometer layer was created using a cyclic voltammetry electrodeposition (CV) operation in a standard three-electrode cell. In this cell, the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode, the platinum sheet as the counter electrode, and the Ni-Cu sample as the working electrode. The chemical composition of the coating bath at this stage includes 0.05 M NiSO4.6H2O, 0.5 M NaH2PO2.H2O, 0.015 M CuSO4.6H2O and 0.1 M trisodium citrate dehydrate. The voltage range in the CV deposition operation is between -0.4 to -1.4 V vs.SCE. The scanning rate was 20 mV.dec−1, and the coating was done in 10, 20, 30, 30, and 50 cycles denoted as 10-C, 20-C, 30-C, and 50-C. After the coating treatment, the samples were washed several times with distilled water and prepared for further testing."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization From the perspective of microstructure and chemical composition, synthesized electrodes were evaluated by Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (MIRA3 TESCAN-XMU) equipped with energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS). The phase structure was investigated by x-ray diffraction (XRD) (XRD; PANalytical X'Pert PRO MPD, Cu). The chemical composition of the surface and valence state of atoms was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS, Thermo Scientific/ESCALAB 250Xi). Further information on the microstructure and chemical composition of the coating was obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Hitachi HF-3300, 300 kV). All electrochemical studies were performed on a standard three-electrode cell, using the Ag /AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, the graphite rod as the counter electrode, and the prepared sample as the working electrode. All electrochemical studies were performed by Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat, Metrohm PGSTA30. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was used to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity in 1.0 M KOH solution at a rate of 1 mV.dec−1. A solution containing N2H4 was also used to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the HzOR process. Tafel curves were also extracted from the linear section of LSV curves to evaluate the kinetics and mechanism of electrochemical processes. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also used to investigate the electrocatalytic activity and mechanism of electrochemical processes. The operating frequency range for EIS operations was between 100 kHz and 100 mHz, and the amplitude potential was 5 mV. Chronopotentiometry tests at a current density of 100 mAcm−2 and multi-step chronopotentiometry were also used to investigate electrocatalytic stability. The two-electrode cell was also used to evaluate the ability of the generated electrode as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the hybrid HER-HzOR system."
4,Results and discussion,
5,"Morphology, microstructure, and composition","3.1 Morphology, microstructure, and composition Initially, the microstructure and morphology of the various electrodes were investigated by FESEM. FESEM image of synthesized Ni-Cu is shown in Fig. S1. It can be seen that Ni-Cu micro-nanodendrite is formed at the surface. Excessive hydrogen evolution at the cathode surface during electrochemical deposition leads to the formation of dendrite-like nanostructures [46,47]. The nanostructure formed is cedar-leaf like. Hydrogen evolution and the formation of hydrogen bubbles during electrochemical deposition can lead to a unique state of morphology in the 3D form [48]. It prevents nickel and copper growth near the evolved bubbles, which causes nickel and copper deposits to occur in the interstitial spaces between the hydrogen bubbles. The evolution of hydrogen bubbles is from the substrate and hydrogen released from the freshly deposited copper and nickel, which leads to the formation of a three-dimensional structure. Hydrogen bubbles act as a dynamic template to form nanostructures. Also, the FESEM images of the Ni-Cu-P@Ni-Cu samples synthesized in the different cycles are shown in Fig. 2 a-d, respectively. There is a pattern of micro-nanodendrite. The Ni-Cu-P electrode also precipitates as a micro-nanodendrite. As the number of coating cycles increases, the amount of precipitated Ni-Cu-P increases, increasing the thickness of the electrode, and gradually, the dendritic pattern disappears, which leads to a decrease in electrochemical active surface area. Less magnification FESEM image of coated Ni foam of Ni-Cu-P@Ni-Cu is shown in Fig. 3 a. It is seen that Ni-Cu-P@ Ni-Cu is uniformly coated onto the surface of nickel foam. EDS analysis was used to investigate the chemical composition of the electrode. The EDS analysis for the 20-C sample is shown in Figure S2. The electrode consists of elements P, Ni, and Cu, which indicate that all the elements have been successfully involved in the formation of the coating. Elemental mappings of Ni, P, and Cu elements are also shown in Fig. S3. It can be seen that Cu and Ni are uniformly present in all parts, and the element P is present only in the dendritic parts, which are evenly distributed. STEM-EDS elemental mapping was also used to more accurately study the chemical composition and how the various elements were distributed. The elemental mapping images for the various elements are shown in Fig. 3b, which shows that all the elements are evenly distributed in all parts of the dendrites. Further information on morphology and phase composition was gained from TEM and HRTEM images. The TEM image shown in Fig. 3c is similar to the FESEM images showing micro-nanodendrite structure formation. The XRD spectra shown in Fig S4 indicate the presence of Ni and Cu phases. According to ICDD 03-065-9743, in this pattern, the peaks at 2θ= 43°, 50.1°, and 73.6°, related to (111), (002), (022) plane Cu phase respectively, and according to ICDD 1-087-0712, the peaks at2θ=44.5°, 51.8°, and 76.4° are related for Ni phase for the similar plane. XRD results show the presence of Ni and Cu phases. The absence of phosphorus phases in the XRD spectrum is the reason why the Ni-Cu-P coating applied to the Ni-Cu surface is amorphous. Therefore, it can be said that the structure created is core-shell, the phase of the core structure is crystalline, and the phase of shell structure is amorphous. The HRTEM image in Fig. 3c also shows the core-shell structure, in which the (111) plane is seen in the core structure, which is related to the nickel and copper phases. Also, in the shell structure, which is amorphous, no atomic order is observed. The formation of an amorphous structure in the electrochemical deposition of transmission metal phosphide has also been reported by other researchers [49,50]. XPS was used to study surface chemistry as well as the electronic state of the Ni-Cu-P@Ni-Cu electrode. The overall XPS spectrum is shown in Fig. 4 a, and the core-level spectra for Cu 2p, Ni 2p, and P2p are shown in Figs. 4b-d, respectively. The XPS spectrum represents the presence of elements P, Ni, Cu, carbon, and oxygen. The presence of phosphorus, nickel, and copper elements is consistent with the EDS results and indicates the successful presence of these elements at the electrode surface. Also, the presence of carbon is due to surface contamination, and the presence of oxygen can be caused by surface oxidation. The Cu 2p spectrum represents the peaks of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, at 934.9 and 954.8 eV, respectively, which are related to Cu2+ in the form of phosphate. This binding energy confirms that Cu gains a positive charge in Ni-Cu-P [51]. Also, the other two peaks in binding energies 942.7 eV and 962.8 eV are related to shake up satellite peaks. In the high-resolution Spectrum Ni2p, the peaks in the binding energies of 856.5 eV and 874 eV due to Ni2+ in phosphate form. Asnavandi et al. [51], reported that the formation of Ni 2p3/2 at lower binding energy in comparison with Ni-Cu confirms that Ni has gained a partial positive charge. There are also satellite peaks for Ni 2p2/3 and Ni 2p1/2. Also, in Spectrum P 2p, the peak at 133.1 eV is POx [52,53] and Pδ− show the formation of metal phosphides (i.e, between P and Cu, P and Ni)."
6,Hydrogen evolution reaction performance,"3.2 Hydrogen evolution reaction performance Initially, the electrocatalytic performance of the electrodes synthesized in this study was investigated in the HER process. To investigate the electrocatalytic activity in the 1.0 M KOH solution, LSV test with a rate of 1 mV.s−1 was used in a standard three-electrode cell. The LSV curves on which the iR correction operation is performed are shown in Fig. 5 a. For comparison, the LSV curve of the platinum electrode is also shown in the figure. One of the best methods to evaluate electrocatalytic performance is to evaluate the amount of potential required at a given current density. Here, the required potential values ​​ to create current densities of 10 mA.cm−2 and 100 mA.cm−2 (η10 and η100), were used as shown in Fig. 5b. As expected, the platinum electrode exhibits the best electrocatalytic activity, at which the onset potential value is approximately zero. With increasing overpotential, the cathodic current density increases sharply, indicating the high thermodynamic and kinetic activity of this electrode. As seen, the increase in the number of coating cycles had a significant effect on the coating's morphology and microstructure. Therefore, it can be expected that the number of coating cycles will also affect the electrocatalytic activity and HER performance. LSV curves show that increasing the number of cycles from 10 cycles to 20 cycles leads to a decrease in η10 from 174 mV to 70 mV, indicating an improvement in electrocatalytic activity. Also, an increase in the number of cycles from 20 to 30 cycles and then 50 cycles leads to an increase in the value of η10 to 114 mV and 231 mV, respectively, indicating a weakening of the electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, it can be concluded that the 20-C sample has the best electrocatalytic activity. Significantly, an electrocatalyst must perform well in both low-current and high-current densities. In the 20-C sample with increasing potential, the cathodic current density increases sharply, which requires only 137 mV of overpotential to create a current density of 100 mA.cm−2. This value is often comparable to and, in most cases, better than the values ​​reported in the literature (see Table S1 for further comparison). The Tafel slopes are also useful for figures of merit to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity. Tafel curves were extracted from the linear part of LSV curves and are shown in Fig. 5c. These curves represent the relationship between the potential and the logarithm of the current density associated with the Tafel equation, and these curves are used to study the mechanism of electrochemical processes in the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte. Possible steps for HER initially include Volmer step (H2O + e− → Hads + OH−), in which the Hads represent the atomic hydrogen absorbed on the surface. Here are two steps: Heyrovsky (H2O + e− + Hads → H2 + OH) or Tafel (Hads + Hads → H2). The Heyrovsky stage includes electrochemical desorption, and the Tafel stage includes chemical desorption. In general, two mechanisms can be considered Volmer-Heyrovsky or Volmer-Tafel. When the Hads values ​​on the surface are low, the Volmer step can control the overall reaction rate at which the Tafel slope should be equal to 120 mV.dec−1. Conversely, when the surface concentration of Hads on the surface is high, the overall rate determining step of the HER process is Heyrovsky or Tafel, for which the Tafel slopes are 40 mV.dec−1 and 30 mV.dec−1, respectively [54,55]. The Tafel slope values shown in this study are in the range of 76-125 mV.dec−1, which is consistent with the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. There is also a decrease in the Tafel slope for the 20-C sample, which is equal to 76 mV.dec−1, which indicates that this electrode also has the highest HER kinetics, so it has the best electrocatalytic activity. In general, electrocatalytic behavior is a function of two important variables of intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and active surface active area. Simultaneously improving the active surface area and the inherent electrocatalytic activity, excellent electrocatalytic activity can be achieved. Therefore, the reason for the better electrocatalytic activity of the 20-C sample can be investigated by evaluating the active surface area and the inherent electrocatalytic activity. The ECSA value can be gained by calculating the Cdl in the non-Faradic current area. In this method, CV curves are plotted at different scanning rates in this area, and the slope of the current density curve in terms of scanning rate is equal to Cdl based on the following relationship [56,57]: (2) Δ i = 2 υ C dl Then, by knowing Cdl and dividing it by the Cdl value of a surface that is atomically smooth (20µF), the ECSA value can be calculated. The CV curves for 20-C samples along with the current density curve according to the scanning rate, are shown in Fig. S5. The results clearly show that as the number of coating cycles increases, the value of Cdl and thus, the value of ECSA decreases. This value is the maximum value for the coating formed in the number of cycles 10 and the minimum value for the coating formed in the number of cycles of 50. The reason for the decrease in ECSA by increasing the number of coating cycles is the increase in the amount of catalyst load on the surface of micro-nanodendrite, which gradually leads to the disappearance of the three-dimensional substrate pattern and thus reduces the electrochemical active surface area ​​. However, as we have seen, the best electrocatalytic properties are related to the 20-C sample. As mentioned, the active surface area and the inherent electrocatalytic activity will simultaneously lead to the creation of an electrocatalyst with the desired activity. Therefore, to eliminate the effect of active surface area and obtain intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, the cathodic current density must be divided by ECSA to obtain the normalized current density. Normalized current density curves for different samples are also shown in Fig. S6. Intrinsic electrocatalytic activity is seen to enhances with the increasing number of coating cycles. The reason for the improvement in intrinsic electrocatalytic activity is the increase in load and the increase in the amount of phosphorus in the catalyst. In general, negative localized charges on the surface of phosphorus atoms in the MPs structure lead to the adsorption of protons, resulting in a more comfortable discharge process, which in turn improves the HER process. Due to its high Hads coverage, it has been reported that it can lead to improved electrocatalytic activity. DFT calculations have also shown that increasing the P value leads to improved electrocatalytic activity [58,59]. Also, phosphorus heteroatoms can effectively improve the electronic structure of metals and thus facilitate the process of separating hydrogen from the metal surface, which leads to improved electrocatalytic activity [54]. Thus, it can be said that the 20-C sample has both a high active surface area and an adequate intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. Therefore, it has the best electrocatalytic activity. The 10-C sample has a weaker electrocatalytic activity due to the low intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, and the 50-C sample, due to the low electrochemical active surface area has weaker electrocatalytic activity​​. In this section, the mechanism and strategy of improving the electrocatalytic activity of the Ni-Cu-P@ Ni-Cu nanodendrite electrode in this study compared to other studies are discussed. The first mechanism is the improvement of the inherent electrocatalytic activity by alloying Ni-P with the Cu element. The presence of the Cu can effectively lead to the modification of the electronic structure, thereby optimizing the adsorption energy and thus improving the kinetics of the catalytic process. The XPS results show a positive nickel and copper charge and a negative phosphor charge. Metal centers (nickel and copper in this study) adsorb hydride, and phosphorus atoms receive the proton. In other words, the nickel and copper centers are electron receptors and proton receptors during the HER process. The adsorbed protons on the phosphor centers receive the electrons they need from the metal centers, resulting in the formation of a hydrogen molecule [60]. DFT calculations have shown that the addition of Cu leads to a change in the electronic structure of Ni-P, leading to optimization of hydrogen evolution and adsorption energy, and thus leads to an improvement in electrocatalytic activity [61]. On the other hand, the presence of Cu in the structure leads to an increase in electrons in the valence band and near the Fermi surface. The presence of Cu-3d by providing more electrons leads to an increase in Fermi level to higher energy levels, leading to a decrease in the energy required to produce hydrogen [62]. Therefore, the active sites for the HER process are phosphorus atoms at the electrode surface and also the synergistic effect of the presence of copper on the electrode surface. Metal regions are hydride-acceptor, as well as P centers are proton-acceptor, the presence of which simultaneously leads to a significant improvement in electrocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the HER is a gas-evolving electrochemical process. Therefore, mass transfer from the electrode-electrolyte interface is very important. Characteristics of the solid-liquid interface play an essential role in the electrocatalytic process, which has received little attention in recent years. The hydrogen bubbles generated at the cathode surface are pinned or accumulated, especially at high current densities at the electrode surface. Aforementioned phenomena lead to a decrease in the interface between the solid and the liquid and decrease in the mass transfer and electron transfer rate and the creation of additional resistance. Consequently, the potential required for hydrogen production increases. Rapid separation of the bubbles from the surface leads to a reduction in additional resistance, which has been a major challenge in recent years. In general, increasing surface wetting, as well as increasing arerophobicity is expected to increase the efficiency and stability of gas-evolving electrochemical processes. Various studies have shown that the formation of active compounds in the form of micro-nanostructures leads to the formation of a superaerophobic surface, leading to an increase in the rate of separation of the bubble from the surface a decrease in bubble resistance [13]. The creation of nanostructured surfaces leads to the non-continuous three-phase contact line (solid-liquid-gas), which effectively reduces the adhesion force to the produced bubble, which ultimately leads to the rapid separation of the bubble [63]. To investigate the effect of nanostructures created in this study on the rapid separation of bubbles, the size of the bubbles at the surface of the optimal electrode (generated in the number of cycles 20) and nickel foam is shown in Fig. S7. In order to create the same conditions, images of bubbles were recorded at a current density of 30 mA.cm−2. As expected, the porous structure created in this study shows very little adhesion force to the bubble, which results in the bubble separating from the surface at a much smaller size than the nickel foam. Besides, the penetration of electrolytes into the pores of the electrode leads to an increase in the available space for electrochemical reactions. Therefore, in this section, the optimal electrode wetting in this study and nickel foam was also investigated and shown in Fig. S8. The contact angle of the nickel foam is about 67°, and the contact angle of the Ni-Cu-P@Ni-Cu electrode is less than 5° which is superhydrophilic. This leads to greater penetration of the electrolyte and thus the electroactive species into the electrolyte pores, thus improving the electrocatalytic activity. Electromechanical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate the interface properties, investigate the charge transfer resistance, and understand the HER mechanism. The Nyquist curves for the synthesized samples are shown in 200, and 300 mV overpotentials are presented in Fig. S9, as well as the Nyquist curves for the optimal sample in Fig. 5d. In order to fit the data, an electrical equivalent circuit with two-time constant series (2TS) (Fig. 5f) was used. In this circuit, Rs indicates solution resistance, the first time constant (CPE1, R1) is related to the porosity of the electrode and also, the second time constant (CPE2, R2) is related to the HER kinetics. Since the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte is not ideally smooth due to pores and nanostructures, more complex elements such as a constant phase element (CPE) are required for detailed analysis in response to impedance instead of a pure capacitor (Cdl). According to the Nyquist curves, the curves consist of two semicircles that are overlapped. The semicircle diameter at high frequencies does not change with increasing potential, but the diameter of the second semicircle at low frequencies decreases with increasing potential. As mentioned, the diameter of the second semicircle indicates the charge transfer resistance. A decrease of charge transfer resistance is also seen in the Bode plot in Fig. 5e. In the bode plot, the resistance value at the minimum frequency indicates the charge transfer resistance. Decreased charge transfer resistance with increasing potential indicates an increase in kinetic HER, which is consistent with LSV results. Also, the presence of a semicircle in the Nyquist curves indicates that the HER process here is controlled by charge transfer. The Tafel curves also showed that the Volmer process, which consists of electrochemical charge transfer, controls the overall reaction rate, which is consistent with the EIS results [64]. It can be seen that the lowest charge transfer resistance is related to the 20-C sample at a constant potential, which also indicates that the electrode formed in the number of 20 cycles is the most electrocatalytic activity. Changes in CPE2 by increasing the potential can indicate the accumulation of hydrogen bubbles at the electrode surface. Based on the results presented in Table S2, it can be seen that with increasing overpotential, the amount of CPE remains almost constant. In other studies, increasing the potential reduces the amount of CPE due to the accumulation or pinning of hydrogen bubbles at high current densities [65,66]. The reason why CPE does not change in this study is due to the rapid separation of bubbles at the surface and, as a result, the lack of accumulation of bubbles at the surface in high current densities. In addition to electrocatalytic activity, electrocatalytic stability, especially at high current densities, is another important factor for the practical and industrial use of electrodes [23]. Electrocatalytic stability can be investigated by various methods, one of the most common of which is monitoring the potential at a constant cathodic current density (chronopotentiometry). The chronopotentiometry curve in the cathodic current density of 100 mA.cm−2 and the duration of 10 h electrolysis is shown in Fig. 6 a. Throughout the electrolysis, hydrogen bubbles were visible on the surface of the electrode. During the 10 h of electrolysis, the potential changes are very small and insignificant (less than 4%), indicating that the electrocatalytic stability of the electrode is excellent. Electrocatalytic durability was also investigated by the multistep-chronopotentiometry shown in Fig. 6b. In this test, the current density increases from 10 to 100 mA.cm−2. By increasing the current density, the potential remains constant, and then, as the current density changes, so does the potential immediately, indicating excellent electrocatalytic stability. Also, rapid changes in potential indicate high conductivity, excellent mass transfer, and excellent robustness of the Ni-Cu-P@ Ni-Cu electrode [67,68]. To test the morphological stability and chemical composition of FESEM, TEM, TEM-elemental mapping, and XPS tests were performed after the HER test. FESEM and TEM images after the stability test (Fig. 6a) are shown. The electrode morphology remains almost constant after the stability test, which means excellent morphological stability. Also, TEM-elemental mapping (Fig. 6c) shows the uniform distribution of all elements after the stability test, which indicates excellent chemical composition stability of the electrode and also shows that no dissolution occurred during the stability test. The XPS test was also used to evaluate the stability of the chemical state and the oxidation state after the stability test (Fig. 6d). The XPS test also shows that after the stability test, the Ni 2p show the presence of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, Cu 2p spectrum confirm the presence of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 and finally the P 2p spectrum indicates the POX and Pδ−. It can be seen that the chemical state remains almost intact, which also indicates the high chemical stability of the Ni-Cu-P @ Ni-Cu electrode. The reason for such morphological stability and high chemical composition can be examined from the point of view of bubble size and adhesion force. When the bubble separates from the surface, a force is applied to the surface, which destroys the surface. Detachment force is directly related to the volume of the bubble when separated from the surface, and the larger the volume of the bubble, the higher the force applied by the bubble to the surface [69,70]. A more intense reaction between the bubble and the surface leads to scratch/drag of the electrochemical locations, resulting in reduced electrocatalytic activity and stability. The special structure of Ni-Cu-P@ Ni-Cu causes the bubble to separate from the surface with a smaller size, which reduces the force applied by the bubble to the surface, increases morphological stability and chemical composition, and as a result., electrocatalytic stability improves."
7,Hydrazine electro-oxidation,"3.3 Hydrazine electro-oxidation To investigate the cause of the use of hydrazine oxidation replacement reaction, instead of OER, the electrolytic activity of the optimal electrode for the OER process was first investigated. The LSV curve for the OER study is shown in Fig. 7 a in 1.0 M KOH solution. The peak shown before the evolution of oxygen is related to nickel oxidation. As can be seen, in order to generate a current density of 10 mA.cm−2 in the OER process, 270 mV of potential is required, which is a large amount. Due to this undesirable overproduction, this anode requires much energy for hydrogen production in the water-splitting process. Therefore, replacing an anodic reaction with a lower thermodynamic potential could be of great help in reducing the energy required to produce hydrogen. The HzOR process is an ideal alternative to OER. The amount of thermodynamic voltage at the of this reaction is only -0.33 V.vs.RHE [43,71]. Therefore, by replacing the OER reaction with HzOR, the amount of cell voltage can be drastically reduced. Initially, the electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes in this study was performed by LSV curves in a three-electrode cell for the HzOR process in the 1.0 KOH medium with different concentrations of N2H4. The LSV curves for the synthesized electrode at different concentrations of hydrazine in Fig. 7b. It is observed that with increasing the concentration of hydrazine in the electrolyte, the electrocatalytic activity improves, and the best electrocatalytic activity is seen at a concentration of 0.5 M N2H4. Therefore, the electrocatalytic activity of different electrodes synthesized in different cycles in a solution containing a concentration of 0.5 M N2H4 was investigated (Fig 7c). In this case, as in the HER process, the best electrocatalytic properties of the 20-C sample are observed. For this electrode, 3.88 mV and 122 mV vs.RHE are required to generate a current density of 10 and 100 mA.cm−2, respectively, which is much less than the voltage required for the OER process. This indicates the effectiveness of using the HzOR process as an alternative to the OER process. Also, the Tafel slope of the 20-C sample is the lowest value and is equal to 63 mV.dec−1, which also means the highest kinetics on the surface of this electrode. Also, the electrocatalytic stability in Fig. 7e shows that after 10 hours of electrolysis at a current density of 100 mA.cm−2, the potential does not change much, which also indicates the excellent electrocatalytic stability of the Ni-Cu-P@Ni-Cu electrode for the HzOR process. FESEM image after HzOR stability inserted in Fig. 7e indicates high morphological stability. Such excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability can be attributed to a variety of factors. Increased electrochemical active sites resulting from the formation of micro-nanodendrite lead to an increase in available sites for electrochemical reactions to improve electrocatalytic activity. Also, a strong synergistic effect between nickel, copper, and phosphorus leads to the improvement of electrocatalytic activity. As seen in XPS analysis, the presence of oxidized P species can significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity of HzOR and is, therefore, an active site [72]. Rapid separation of N2-produced bubbles from the surface and the penetration of electrolyte into the surface pores leads to a decrease in bubble resistance, increased charge and mass transfer, and an increase in available locations for electrochemical reactions and thus an improvement in electrocatalytic activity. Also, the high adhesion of the electrode to the substrate and the lack of polymeric binder in the electrode, lead to non-blocking of electrochemical active sites and increase the electrocatalytic stability, especially at high current densities."
8,Hybrid water electrolysis,"3.4 Hybrid water electrolysis After examining the electrocatalytic activity of the Ni-Cu-P@ Ni-Cu electrode for HER and HzOR processes, in this section, the electrocatalytic activity of the present electrode as bi-functional electrocatalyst for HER and HzRO processes in a two-electrode water electrolysis system is examined. In this system, the Ni-Cu-P@Ni-Cu electrode was used as an anode and a cathode simultaneously. The solution used for this test was 1.0 M KOH+0.5 M N2H4. The schematic figure of the process is shown in Fig. 8 a. For comparison, a two-electrode system with similar electrodes was used but without the presence of N2H4. The polarization curves for the two electrode systems are shown in Fig. 8b. The hybrid system, which at the anode surface HzOR is processed, requires 125 mV and 262 mV voltage to generate the current densities of 10 and 100 mA.cm−2 respectively. However, to create a current density of 100 mA.cm−2 in the overall water splitting system without the presence of hydrazine, a potential of 1.77 V is required, which is much higher than 262 mV. Therefore, it can be said that the use of the HzOR replacement process instead of the OER process leads to a significant decrease in voltage and thus the cost required to produce hydrogen. The performance of the electrode created in this study is comparable as a bi-functional electrode for hybrid HER, and HzOR reactions and, in many cases, is much better than the values ​​reported in the literature (see Table S3 for comparison). As mentioned, the product of the hydrazine oxidation process is nitrogen gas, which is a safe gas. The electrocatalytic stability of the electrode during water electrolysis was also investigated for practical use, as shown in Fig. 8c (Also, the photograph of the HER-HzOR system is shown in Fig. 8c). It is observed that after 50 hours of electrolysis, not much change is observed in the potential, which also indicates the excellent electrocatalytic stability of the present electrode. Also, the elemental mapping after overall water splitting stability is given in Fig. S10. It is seen that the distribution of all elements is uniform which indicates high chemical composition stability and no dissolution of elements during the electrocatalytic stability test."
