0,Introduction,"Some efficient utilization technologies of renewable energy sources like biomass derivatives to develop environmentally benign chemical processes have been largely attracted for the productions of clean alternative fuels due to the limited reservoirs of crude oils [1]. The chemical transformation routes of syngas (mainly, CO and H2), which can be derived from biomass gasification or reforming of many hydrocarbon sources, have a lot of potentials to produce valuable chemicals such as mixed alcohols (ethanol and butanol) or oxygenates as well as hydrocarbons by CO hydrogenation reaction. These value-added chemicals can be further used as fuel additives for an enhancement of octane or cetane number or as petrochemical intermediates as well [2–4]. Based on many previous researches related with the synthesis of mixed alcohols from syngas directly [5], the reported heterogeneous catalysts can be generally categorized such as Rh-based, Cu-based (modified methanol synthesis catalysts), modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (Fe-based catalysts), and Mo-based catalysts [2,5,6]. Among them, we focus on the precious novel Rh-based heterogeneous catalysts, since it has been well known to have a higher activity to form C2+ oxygenates such as ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetic acid from syngas selectively [2,7]. In addition, the active Rh metal nanoparticles has a potential to form various value-added products such as alcohols, hydrocarbons and oxygenates by properly adjusting reaction conditions. The Rh metal also has the proper characteristics for a selective formation of many oxygenates due to its intrinsic electronic characters in the periodic table between an easy dissociation of CO molecules on the Fe or Co metal to form hydrocarbons and a non-dissociative adsorption of CO molecules on the Pd, Pt or Ir metal to produce oxygenates preferentially [2,7–9]. The Rh-based heterogeneous catalysts also showed a higher activity to abundantly form the oxygenates by adding some proper chemical promoters such as K, Ti, V or Mn and so on [10]. Especially, the active Rh metal with Mn promoter has been reported as a proper catalytic system for a higher activity and selectivity to C2+ oxygenates through the enhanced adsorption capacities of tilted CO molecules resulted in a facile dissociation of CO molecules [11–13]. To increase the metal dispersion with a less mass-transport limitation, many metal-modified ordered mesoporous carbon materials having a high surface area have been widely studied in various catalytic reactions including syngas conversions. The advantages of mesoporous materials are to improve catalytic activity through an easy mass-transports and adjusted metal-support interactions with small active metal sizes, and they can be prepared by using a hard template such as highly ordered mesoporous silicas [14,15]. In our previous work [16], Mn promoter on the Rh-based mesoporous tungsten carbides (WxC) revealed the significant effects for a selective production of mixed alcohols from syngas by its intimate interactions with supported Rh nanoparticles by forming their optimal oxidation states. These ordered mesoporous materials have superior characteristics such as a large surface area due to its highly ordered mesoporous structures which are generally beneficial for a high metal dispersion. Therefore, the ordered mesoporous WxC support was prepared by using a highly ordered mesoporous SBA-15 as a hard-template through the well-known replica method [16–18] and it was investigated for a direct syngas conversion to mixed alcohols. In addition, the tungsten carbides have many superior characters such as a large hardness, high melting point, elastic modulus and chemical inertness with tunable pore structures and so on [19–22]. Based on these superior characteristics of WxC, the ordered Mn-promoted mesoporous Rh/WxC at an optimal amount of Mn enhanced the close interactions of Rh and Mn nanoparticles by stably preserving the partially reduced Rh metals, and these partially oxidized Rh nanoparticles finally leaded to a superior CO conversion with a higher production rate of mixed alcohols [16,23]. In the present investigation, the roles of the ordered mesoporous WxC phases prepared by using a hard template replica method at a fixed Rh-Mn ratio and various carbon source to tungsten (C/W) ratios were investigated to verify the reasons for an enhanced catalytic activity and mixed alcohol productivity on the W2C phases of the Rh-Mn/WxC. The increased activity to mixed alcohols on the Rh-Mn/WxC was explained in terms of surface distributions of the active metals and its oxidation states according to three different mesoporous tungsten carbide phases such as the WO3, W2C and WC."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparations and activity measurements of Rh-Mn/WxC,"2.1 Catalyst preparations and activity measurements of Rh-Mn/WxC The ordered mesoporous WxC supports were previously synthesized by using a hard template of a home-made SBA-15 having a specific surface area of 679 m2/g and average pore diameter of 6.3 nm as shown in supplementary Fig. S1 and Fig. S2. Using the highly ordered SBA-15 confirmed by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis and TEM images, the ordered WxC support was prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method using two precursors of carbon and tungsten at different carbon to tungsten molar ratios (C/W) from 1 to 20 by thermochemical method. For more details, the hard template of an ordered mesoporous SBA-15 pores were completely impregnated with an exactly same amount of its pore volumes of an aqueous sulfuric acid solution containing a sucrose as carbon source (C12H22O11, Aldrich) and ammonium metatungstate precursor ((NH4)6[H2W12O40], Aldrich) as tungsten metal source. The mixed metal-carbon solution containing SBA-15 was dried at 100 °C for 6 h followed by drying at 160 °C for 6 h again with successive 2 time repetitions. Subsequently, a typical carburization step by thermochemical method was applied to prepare the mesoporous WxC followed by the thermal treatment steps of 300, 600 and 900 °C with a ramping rate of 1 °C/min and kept at each temperature for 5 h under a flow of 5 vol% H2 balanced with N2. After the carburization treatments, the hard template of SBA-15 was removed using 1.0 M NaOH aqueous solution several times, and the as-prepared WxC support was dried at 110 °C overnight. For the preparation of Rh-Mn impregnated WxC catalysts, the fixed amount of active metals such as 5 wt%Rh-3wt%Mn using the metal precursors of rhodium(III) chloride hydrate (RhCl3·xH2O) and manganese(II) nitrate hydrate (Mn(NO3)2·xH2O) [16] was subsequently added on the as-prepared WxC supports prepared at different C/W ratios by an incipient wetness impregnation method. More detailed preparation methods of the mesoporous Rh-Mn/WxC were described in the previous results [16,23]. The as-prepared catalysts just after drying without any further oxidative thermal treatment are denoted as Rh-Mn/WxC(x), where x represents the C/W molar ratios in the range of 1–20 on the mesoporous WxC supports. Direct CO hydrogenation to mixed alcohols from syngas was carried out in a flow fixed-bed tubular reactor having an outer diameter of 12.7 mm using 0.2 g catalyst, which has an average particle size of ∼60 μm, where the catalyst size has been known to show an insignificant mass-transport limitation [24,25]. Before the reaction, the catalyst was previously reduced with 10 vol%H2 balanced with N2 at 300 °C for 5 h at an atmospheric pressure. After cooling down the temperature to ambient one, the reduced catalyst was purged with the syngas having a molar ratio of H2/CO = 2 until the reduction gas in the reactor was completely removed. The flow rate of the syngas was adjusted to meet a weight hourly space velocity (SV) of 8000 l/kgcat/h, and the reaction was carried out at 300 °C and 5.0 MPa. The effluent gases from the reactor were simultaneously analyzed by on-line gas chromatography (YoungLin 6100 GC) connected with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with a Carboxen 1000 capillary column for the analyses of inflammable gases and a flame ionization detector (FID) with a Plot-Q capillary column for the analysis of oxygenates and hydrocarbons formed. CO conversions and product distributions were calculated based on the total carbon mol% (C-mol%), and the productivity of C1-C3 alcohols was calculated according to the following equations with the assumption of negligible coke formations. CO conversion ( C - mol % ) = ∑ i M i × n i M CO × 100 ( % ) Product distribution ( C - mol % ) = M i × n i ∑ i M i × n i × 100 ( % ) Productivity of C 1 - C 3 alcohols ( g/ ( hg cat h ) ) = mol converted CO × ∑ M OH × S OH weight of cat ( kg ) × hour where, M i represents the mol% of the product i and n i for the number of carbons in the product i detected by a FID analyzer, and M CO represents the mol% of CO in the feed gas detected by TCD analyzer. The M OH and S OH represent the molar weight of each alcohols and selectivity of each alcohols formed, respectively."
3,Characterization of Rh-Mn/WxC,"2.2 Characterization of Rh-Mn/WxC The surface properties of the fresh mesoporous Rh-Mn/WxC were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis. The isotherms were measured at liquid N2 temperature of −196 °C using a Tristar (Micromeritics) instrument. The specific surface area, pore volume, average pore diameter and pore size distribution were calculated by a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method as well as BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) method from the branch of the desorption isotherm. Wide angel powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC were obtained by using a high-resolution X-ray diffractometer operating at 2 kW and 55 mA with a Cu-Kα radiation of 0.15406 nm in the scanning range of 2θ = 10 - 90° to elucidate crystalline structures of active metals and tungsten carbide phases. The crystallite sizes of the WO3, W2C and WC on the Rh-Mn/WxC prepared at different C/W ratios were calculated using a Debye-Scherrer equation from the value of full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense peak of each phases at 2θ = 25.8° for WO3, 2θ = 40.4° for W2C and 2θ = 35.5° for WC phase on the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC. The surface morphologies and crystallite sizes on the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC such as mesoporous structures of the WxC support and size distribution of the active Rh nanoparticles were measured by a field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM) using a JEOL JEM-2100F instrument operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The reduction behaviors of the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC were obtained by temperature-programmed reduction by H2 (TPR) using a BELCAT-M instrument equipped with a TCD analyzer using 0.05 g sample to evaluate the reducibility of the active metals and tungsten carbides as well. Before the TPR analysis, all samples were pretreated at 350 °C for 1 h at a He flow rate of 30 ml/min to remove any contaminants and waters adsorbed. After pretreatment, the sample was exposed to 5 vol%H2 balanced with N2 at a flow rate of 30 ml/min with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min from 100 °C to 850 °C. The amount of consumed H2 was measured by a TCD analyzer after passing over a molecular sieve trap to remove water formed. The outermost surface properties on the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC such as the oxidation and electronic states of Rh nanoparticles, the binding energies (BE) and surface concentrations of each components were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a VG Multilab 2000 instrument with a Mg/Al twin anode as an X-ray radiation source. The BE of C 1s (284.4 eV) was further used as a reference BE to correct the BE shifts of each measured chemical species. The surface ratios of each metal components such as the Rh 3d5/2, Mn 2p3/2 and W 4f7/2 were calculated using an integrated area of each characteristic peaks such as the surface ratios of Rh/C, Mn/C, Rh/Mn and Rh n+ /Rh0, which possibly represents the relative oxidation states of Rh nanoparticles by using an integrated area of the shoulder peak at a slightly higher BE than that of main Rh 3d5/2 peak at ∼310 eV. Dispersive Raman spectroscopy analysis was performed at ambient conditions using a Bruker FRA106/S instrument with an excitation laser of Nd:YAG (wavelength of 1064 nm) and optical power of 300 mW to verify the structural stability of each WxC phases and relative crystallinity of carbon matrixes formed on the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Bulk and surface properties and catalytic activity of the Rh-Mn/WxC,"3.1 Bulk and surface properties and catalytic activity of the Rh-Mn/WxC The C/W ratios of the WxC supports during the support preparation steps largely altered the tungsten carbide phases and active metal dispersion on the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC as displayed in Fig. 1 . The main crystalline phases of the as-prepared WxC on the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC were stably preserved even after the active Rh-Mn metal impregnation steps, except for the Rh-Mn/WxC(1). The crystalline phases of WO3 and metallic W were mainly observed on the WxC(1) support as shown in supplementary Fig. S1, however, the WO3 phases without metallic W phases were mainly observed after active metal impregnation due to the oxidative preparation conditions. Interestingly, the WxC phases were gradually transformed from a larger size of tungsten oxide (WO3) phases to the smaller size of WC phases via an intermediate formation of relatively larger W2C phases with an increase of the C/W ratio, which was supported by its gradual decreases of XRD peak intensity. This observation can be attributed to an easy formation of WC phases thermodynamically at a larger amount of carbon sources during the WxC preparation steps. The characteristic WO3 phases appeared at 2θ = 25.8, 37.1, 53.0 and 59.8° were clearly observed with an insignificant WxC peak intensity, which was mainly attributed to the unstable and amorphous tungsten carbide formations at a large content of WO3 species by possible gasification during the preparation step [26]. However, at C/W ratio of 10 on the Rh-Mn/WxC(10), the characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 40.4, 58.3, 73.2 and 87.0° were observed and they are in accordance with the W2C and metallic W phases. A larger peak intensity at 2θ = 40.4° suggests the obvious presence of the crystalline W2C phases [27]. In addition, the main crystalline phases of the WC appeared at 2θ = 31.3, 35.5, 48.2° were clearly observed on the Rh-Mn/WxC(15) and Rh-Mn/WxC(20), and they were attributed to the larger amount of carbon sources by highly dispersed W species in the carbon precursors. The meta-stable W2C phases possessing abundant 5d-orbital electrons compared with the thermally stable WC phases can enhance the electron populations of the Rh nanoparticles by possibly increasing the reducibility with its much stronger interactions on the W2C surfaces [28–30]. We believe that these characteristics can be the main reasons for an enhanced conversion of CO and productivity of mixed alcohols on the Rh-Mn/WxC(10) through an easy enol intermediate formation due to its non-dissociative adsorption characters of CO molecules [2]. In addition, an easy transformation of the W2C phases to the thermally stable WC phases at the much larger carbon contents on the Rh-Mn/WxC can be obtained through the known slow bulk diffusion of carbon to W2C phases [31,32]. However, any characteristic crystalline phases of the Rh and Mn crystallites on the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC were not clearly observed due to their higher dispersion and smaller size below 2 nm, which are hard to be detected by XRD analysis [16]. Based on our previous study for a direct CO hydrogenation to mixed alcohols on the Rh-Mn(x)/WxC at different Rh/Mn ratios [16], an appropriate metal dispersion and close Rh-Mn interaction on the W2C support were responsible for an enhanced productivity of mixed C1 – C4 alcohols at an optimal 5 wt%Rh-3wt%Mn/WxC, and a trivial activity was observed on the WxC support itself. In the present successive investigation, the fixed amounts of Rh-Mn metals were separately impregnated on the different phases of WxC supports such as WO3, W2C and WC. The different WxC phases were prepared by changing the C/W ratios during the preparation of WxC supports to verify the effects of the WxC phases to catalytic performances by different interactions of Rh-Mn species on WxC surfaces. CO hydrogenation activities such as CO conversion and product distribution are summarized in Table 1 . Compared to the monometallic Rh/WxC(10), the less active Rh-Mn/WxC(1) and Rh-Mn/WxC(20) having the respective WxC phases of WO3 and WC showed the much lower CO conversions and C1-C3 alcohol productivities in the range of 30.7–36.1 g/(kgcat·h). However, the much larger alcohol productivity of 171.8 g/(kgcat·h) with a higher CO conversion of 8.1% was observed on the optimal Rh-Mn/WxC(10) having main W2C phases compared to that of 86.1 g/(kgcat·h) on the Rh/WxC(10). After the modification of Mn promoter on the Rh/WxC, even though CO conversion was decreased from 11.4% on the Rh/WxC(10) to 2.1–8.1% on the Mn-promoted Rh/WxC, less useful byproducts such as CO2 and CH4 were significantly decreased, especially on the Rh-Mn/WxC(10). In addition, the selectivity to C1-C3 alcohols with a main product of CH3OH was also increased significantly on the Rh-Mn/WxC, which was attributed to the well-dispersed and intimately interacted Rh crystallites with its proper oxidation states [16]. Interestingly, the WxC support having main WC phases on the Rh-Mn/WxC(15) and Rh-Mn/WxC(20) showed a larger formation of aldehydes and acids up to 14.0%, which can be possibly originated from a facile formation of enol intermediates by the non-dissociative adsorption natures of CO molecules through consecutive reactions of alcohols formed on the strongly interacted metallic Rh nanoparticles on the crystalline WC surfaces [2,28–30]. Interestingly, a relatively higher ethanol selectivity was observed on the most active Rh-Mn/WxC(10) and Rh-Mn/WxC(15) with the value of 7.2 and 11.0%, respectively. It can be attributed to the facile adsorption characters of the non-dissociative adsorption natures of CO molecules. The notably higher production rate of C1 - C3 mixed alcohols with 171.8 g/(kgcat·h) at CO conversion of 8.1% and total alcohol selectivity of 54.4% was observed on the Rh-Mn/WxC(10) having W2C phases mainly, and it was mainly attributed to the high dispersion of Rh nanoparticles with the strong interactions on the meta-stable W2C surfaces by forming an optimal oxidation state of Rh crystallites as explained in the following section. To support the different metal dispersions of the active Rh-Mn nanoparticles on the various phases and surface areas of the WxC supports prepared by using a hard template of an ordered mesoporous SBA-15 having a surface area of 679 m2/g and average pore diameter of 6.3 nm as shown in supplementary Fig. S2, N2 adsorption-desorption analysis was carried out on the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC. The pore size distribution on the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC as displayed in Fig. 2 showed the typical mesopore structure formations with a monomodal homogeneous size distribution between 3 and 5 nm. In addition, the peak intensity on the Rh-Mn/WxC was increased with an increase of the C/W ratios of the WxC supports. The type IV isotherm with H1 hysteresis was observed on all the Rh-Mn/WxC as shown in supplementary Fig. S3 (inset figures in Fig. 2), which clearly suggests the ordered mesoporous structure formations on the Rh-Mn/WxC, especially on the Rh-Mn/WxC(15) as well as Rh-Mn/WxC(20). These ordered mesopore structures were formed from the ordered mesopore structures of the SBA-15 used as a hard template [16]. As summarized in Table 2 , the specific surface area and pore volume were steadily increased with an increase of the C/W ratios due to a well-developed mesopore structure formation at a larger amount of carbon source. These trends were also similar with the surface area variations of the WxC supports themselves as summarized in supplementary Table S1. The observed smaller surface area of 0.3 m2/g of the WxC(1) and larger surface area of 659 m2/g on the WxC(20) support suggest the well-developed mesopore structures on the WxC(20). The specific surface area was increased up to 278 m2/g on the Rh-Mn/WxC(20) from the unmeasurable small area on the Rh-Mn/WxC(1) due to the completely collapsed amorphous mesopore structures. The observed small surface area of 36 m2/g on the Rh-Mn/WxC(10) can be attributed to its relatively less ordered mesopore structures. The trends of pore volume variations were found to be similar with that of the specific surface area. We believe that the observed larger specific surface area on the Rh-Mn/WxC(20) can be attributed to the formation of smaller crystallite size of WC with its size of 11 nm measured by XRD analysis, and vice versa on the Rh-Mn/WxC(1) with the larger crystallite size of WO3 with 45 nm as summarized in Table 2. Therefore, the larger surface areas on the Rh-Mn/WxC having the WC phases mainly with a uniform mesopore diameter of ∼3 nm and a larger pore volume above 0.2 cm3/g can be attributed to the highly ordered mesoporous carbon structures on the Rh-Mn/WxC(15) and Rh-Mn/WxC(20). Even though the much smaller specific surface area of 36 m2/g with a larger average pore size of 6.5 nm was observed on the Rh-Mn/WxC(10), the catalyst eventually showed a higher catalytic performance. This observation also suggests that other factors such as the phases of the WxC support can largely change the electronic states of the Rh nanoparticles and their metal dispersions as well. Therefore, the reducibility and surface electronic states of the Rh nanoparticles on the Rh-Mn/WxC were further explained by using the results of TPR, XPS and Raman analyses."
6,Active metal sites for different product distribution on the Rh-Mn/WxC,"3.2 Active metal sites for different product distribution on the Rh-Mn/WxC The reduction behaviors of the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC(x) from TPR experiments are displayed in Fig. 3 , and the smaller characteristic reduction peaks of the Rh nanoparticles exhibited at around 110–200 °C on the Rh-Mn/WxC(1), which can be possibly attributed to the segregated Rh nanoparticles on the WO3 surfaces. As shown in supplementary Fig. S4, the reduction behaviors of the WxC(10) support and 3 wt%Mn/WxC(10) themselves showed a relatively difficult reducibility below 600 °C with a lower H2 consumption less than 0.02 mmol/g as summarized in supplementary Table S1. Therefore, the characteristic reduction peaks below 600 °C seem to be mainly attributed to the reduction of Rh-Mn nanoparticles. All the Rh-Mn/WxC showed the reduction peaks below 300 °C, which indicates the partially reduced and weakly interacted metallic Rh nanoparticles on the WxC surfaces (assigned to T1 peak for the reduced metal-like Rh0 species through a possible reduction of RhCl3 precursor or oxidized Rh species as well). The characteristic reduction peaks at around 300–600 °C are in accordance with the higher oxidation states of Rh nanoparticles, which can lead to the formation of strongly interacted Rh nanoparticles on the WxC surfaces (assigned to T2 peak for Rhn+ species) [33–36]. The reduction peaks at the much higher temperature regions above 600 °C can be assigned to the possible hydrogenation of WxC supports as clearly shown in supplementary Fig. S4. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3, the peak intensity in the temperature range of 300–600 °C corresponding to the strongly interacted Rh nanoparticles with high oxidation states on the Rh-Mn/WxC(10), was found to be much larger than other catalysts. The amounts of hydrogen consumption for the metallic Rh0 species (T1) assigned to the temperature below 300 °C and the strongly interacted Rh n+ species (T2) in the temperature ranges of 300–600 °C are summarized in Table 2. In general, the Rh–Mn/WxC(10) having a metastable W2C phase mainly seems to preferentially contain the much larger amount of Rh n+ species in the vicinity of the reduced metallic Rh nanoparticles, which have been well reported to be more effective active sites to produce oxygenates selectively [34–36]. The Rh-Mn/WxC(10) showed the highest H2 consumption at the temperature regions of 300–600 °C with the value of 0.56 mmol/g, which can be assigned to the strongly interacted Rh n+ species on the metastable W2C surfaces through its much stronger interactions. It can be responsible for a higher conversion of CO to mixed alcohols compared to other Rh-Mn/WxC having the main phases of WO3 and WC since the values were found to be similar in the range of 0.11–0.13 mmol/g. Interestingly, the much larger portion of the metallic Rho compared to that of the Rh n+ species with the respective values of 0.23 and 0.13 mmol/g on the Rh-Mn/WxC(15) can be responsible for the observed higher CH4 formation with its higher selectivity of 37.5% due to the facile and complete hydrogenation of CO molecules on the metallic Rh nanoparticles [11–13,34–36]. The reduced metallic Rh sites are also responsible for the preferential formations of CO2 and aldehyde/acid species through an increased activity of water gas shift reaction and a further possible condensation/carbonylation reaction of the mixed alcohols formed. Therefore, the lager amount of other byproducts with the value of 10.4–14.0 on the Rh-Mn/WxC(15) and Rh-Mn/WxC(20) seems to be attributed to the larger presence of metallic Rh nanoparticles compared with the Rh-Mn/WxC(10), which showed only 1.1% of these byproducts. Therefore, both the active sites of the strongly interacted Rh n+ and metallic Rh0 nanoparticles can increase the CO conversion on the Rh-Mn/WxC, however, the larger portion of the partially oxidized Rh n+ species seems to be responsible for the enhanced mixed alcohol productivity [37]. As summarized in Table 2, the larger ratios of the Rh−/Rh0 (represented by T2/T1 ratio from TPR) on the Rh-Mn/WxC(10) with the value of 3.11 compared to others in the range of 0.56–2.0 can be a crucial descriptor to explain a higher alcohol productivity. In addition, the ratios of Rh n+ /Rh0 from TPR were well matched with the results of XPS analysis in the following section. Therefore, the total amount of H2 consumption on two different active sites on the Rh-Mn/WxC seems to be well related with the extent of CO conversion. A higher ratio of the Rh n+ /Rh0 can be related with a mixed alcohol selectivity since the non-dissociative adsorption characters of CO molecules on the strongly interacted as well as partially oxidized Rh nanoparticles are responsible for the selective formation of oxygenates through the facile generation of acyl intermediates on the Rh-Mn/WxC surfaces [2,28–30,37]. To further confirm the effects of surface Rh-Mn concentrations, oxidation states of Rh nanoparticles and Rh-Mn interactions with the WxC supports on the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC, XPS analysis was carried out and the patterns are displayed in Fig. 4 with supplementary Fig. S5. The more detailed summarized results of the BEs and outermost surface concentrations of the Rh/C, Mn/C, Rh/Mn and Rh n+ /Rh0 ratios are included in Table 2 and supplementary Table S2. The BEs of the Rh 3d5/2 on the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC were found to be at ∼310 eV, which are in accordance with the Rh3+ species [27,33,38,39], and somewhat lower BE of 308.9 eV on the Rh-Mn/WxC(1) seems to be attributed to the strongly interacted Rh nanoparticles by forming the aggregated larger crystallites on the WO3 surfaces than that of other Rh-Mn/WxC due to its unmeasurable smaller specific surface area. We believe that the XPS peaks are originated from the possible presence of the aggregated RhCl3 precursors since there are no calcination treatments of all the as-prepared Rh-Mn/WxC [16]. The BEs of the Mn 2p3/2 on the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC were observed at ∼642 eV, which represents a highly oxidized Mn3+ species in the main form of Mn2O3 as well [40] and a relatively lower BE of 640.3 eV on the Rh-Mn/WxC(1) can be also attributed to its strong interactions on the WO3 surfaces. In addition, the BEs of the W 4f7/2 were found to be in the wide range of 34.6–36.0 eV, where the BE of the W 4f7/2 at 34.6 eV on the Rh-Mn/WxC(1) can be originated from the WO3 species, and higher BEs above 35.5 eV on the other Rh-Mn/WxC can be possibly attributed to the formation of tungsten carbides such as W2C or WC phases [38] as shown in supplementary Fig. S5. The outermost surface ratios of the Rh/C and Mn/C on all the Rh-Mn/WxC, except for the Rh-Mn/WxC(1), were found to be similar in the range of 0.010–0.017 and 0.010–0.011, respectively. It was attributed to the fixed amount of 5 wt%Rh-3wt%Mn during the catalyst preparation steps. The much higher ratios of the Rh/C with the value of 0.120 and Mn/C with that of 0.068 on the Rh-Mn/WxC(1) can be attributed to the much smaller surface area of the WO3 support. However, the surface ratios of the Rh/Mn showed a maximum value of 1.54 on the most active Rh-Mn/WxC(10) compared with others with the values of 1.02–1.11, which strongly suggests the Rh nanoparticles seems to be preferentially deposited on the outermost surfaces by intimately interacting with the Mn promoter [16] due to its lower surface area of 36 m2/g compared to the Rh-Mn/WxC(20) with that of 278 m2/g. Interestingly, the surface ratios of Rh n+ /Rh0 on the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC as summarized in Table 2 strongly represents the relative oxidation states of the Rh nanoparticles. These ratios were calculated using a shoulder peak at a somewhat higher BE region than a main peak of Rh 3d5/2 at ∼310 eV. The higher Rh n+ /Rh0 ratio of 0.16 was observed on the most active Rh-Mn/WxC(10) and relatively smaller values of 0.06–0.11 were observed on others, which are well in line with the results of the T2/T1 ratios from TPR experiments, except for Rh-Mn/WxC(20). The odd value of 0.23 on the Rh-Mn/WxC(20) can be attributed to the heterogeneous size distributions of the Rh nanoparticles as confirmed by TEM images in Fig. 5 . In addition, the slightly shifted BEs to a higher one on the fresh Rh-Mn/WxC with an increase of Mn content was originated from the possible Mn contribution by increasing the oxidation states of the Rh nanoparticles and by forming strongly interacted ones on the WxC surfaces, especially on the Rh-Mn/WxC(10) having a metastable W2C phases mainly [28–30,36,39,41]. As shown in TEM images in Fig. 5, the highly dispersed metal nanoparticles with an average size below 2 nm were observed on all the used Rh-Mn/WxC having a mesoporous structures, especially on the Rh-Mn.WxC(10) with a relatively homogenous distribution of active Rh nanoparticles on the outer W2C surfaces. Even though the ordered mesoporous WxC structures were not well developed on the WxC support compared with a highly ordered mesoporous SBA-15 structures, the highly ordered mesopore structures were clearly observed on the WxC(10) and Rh-Mn/Wxc(10) due to the possible formation of carbon matrixes incorporated with W2C phases. Therefore, the active Rh nanoparticles with the average size below 2 nm can be much homogeneously distributed on the smaller support grain sizes of the much highly ordered mesoporous and metastable W2C crystallites. This was further confirmed by XRD analysis with the respective grain sizes of WxC supports of 30 and 13 on the Rh-Mn.WxC(10) and Rh-Mn.WxC(15) by forming strong interactions between Rh and WxC surfaces compared to that of the Rh-Mn/WxC(1) having the WO3 grain size of 45 nm as summarized in Table 2 The presence of the metastable α-W2C crystallites at an optimal C/W ratio of 10, which can be easily transformed to much stable hexagonal α-WC crystallite phases at higher temperatures [42], seems to be a main reason for an enhanced stability and activity through a newly generated strong interaction of the partially oxidized Rh nanoparticles on the W2C surfaces. However, the aggregated Rh nanoparticles with the average sizes above 10 nm and much smaller nanoparticles with far below 2 nm in sizes (strongly interacted with WxC supports) were observed on the Rh-Mn.WxC(1) and Rh-Mn.WxC(20) after the reaction. This observation can be attributed to the weakly interacted Rh nanoparticles on the WxC supports having the less ordered mesoporous structures of the WO3 and WC support as shown in Fig. 5 and supplementary Fig. S6. The higher surface area and ordered mesopore structures on the Rh-Mn/WxC(20) seem to be attributed to the mesopore carbon formation at a higher C/W ratio, however, the main phases of WC formed on the Rh-Mn/WC(20) were not effective for the dispersion of Rh nanoparticles and their oxidation states for a selective oxygenate formation. To further confirm the possible formations of meta-stable α-W2C and WC crystallites on the Rh-Mn/WxC, additional Raman analysis were carried out on the fresh WxC supports and the results are displayed in supplementary Fig. S7. In general, the Raman shift bands at ∼690 and 810 cm−1 can be assigned to the W-C stretching modes, and the slight band shifts were observed from 807 to 809 cm−1 on the Rh-Mn/WxC(20) and Rh-Mn/WxC(10), respectively. This slight shift was originated from the phase transformations from a stable hexagonal crystalline phase of α-WC to metastable hcp crystalline phase of α-W2C, and any Raman shifts for the characteristic stable monoclinic WO3 has been known to be hardly detected [42,43], which are similar on the Rh-Mn/WxC. In addition, the Raman shifts appeared at around 1330 and 1590 cm−1 can be responsible for the ordered hexagonal crystal graphite carbons (assigned to D band) and for the amorphous carbons of the in-plane displacements (assigned to G band), respectively [44,45]. As summarized in Table 2, the ratios of D/G represent the extents of amorphous carbon presences in the WxC phases. The observed lower value of 0.4 on the Rh-Mn/WxC(10) compared with that of 2.9–3.4 on the Rh-Mn/WxC(15) and Rh-Mn/WxC(20) suggests that the metastable W2C phases can be distributed in the ordered amorphous carbon matrixes, which can be responsible for the enhanced structural stability as well as for the much higher catalytic activity on the Rh-Mn/WxC(10) even after the reaction as supported from TEM images in Fig. 5. In summary, the observed higher CO conversion and productivity of C1 – C3 mixed alcohols on the Rh-Mn/WxC having the metastable W2C phases were mainly attributed to the strongly interacted Rh nanoparticles with its higher oxidation states and small crystallite sizes. The metastable W2C phases prepared at the C/W ratio of 10 can enhance the electron populations of the supported Rh nanoparticles by its abundant 5d-orbital electron characters, which can also enhance the content of partially oxidized Rh nanoparticles. The facile formation reaction of CHx intermediates formed by CO hydrogenation to easily transform to acyl groups by CO insertion reaction has been known to be preferential on the dual active sites, i.e., the Rh+ sites are more active for the selective formation of C2+ oxygenates including mixed alcohols than the metallic Rho sites [11–13,37,46]. The correlations of CO conversion and productivity of the C1 – C3 mixed alcohols in terms of the Rhn+/Rh0 ratios measured by TPR experiments are displayed in Fig. 6 . Even though CO conversions on the Rh-Mn/WxC were well correlated with the total surface areas of the exposed outermost Rh nanoparticles (higher amount of H2 consumption from TPR and high ratio of Rh.Mn from XPS), the productivity of C1 – C3 mixed alcohols was well correlated with the Rhn+/Rh0 ratios due to the preferential natures of the non-dissociative adsorption of CO molecules to the oxygenates on the strongly interacted and partially oxidized Rh nanoparticles with the positive contribution of the Mn promoter as well. The easy control of the smaller Rh nanoparticle formations having its optimal oxidation sates can be simply adjusted by employing the ordered mesoporous and metastable W2C phases on the bimetallic Rh-Mn/WxC to directly produce the C1 - C3 mixed alcohols from syngas."
7,Conclusions,"The effects of three different tungsten carbide (WxC) phases on the ordered mesoporous bimetallic Rh-Mn/WxC, where the WxC supports were prepared at the different carbon to tungsten metal (C/W) ratios, were verified for the direct synthesis of C1 – C3 mixed alcohols by CO hydrogenation. At an optimal C/W ratio of 10 on the WxC support can preferentially generate the metastable W2C phases, and it showed a higher CO conversion with a higher productivity to mixed alcohols compared to other catalysts having the crystalline phases of WO3 and WC. These positive effects on the W2C phases were attributed to the synergistic effects of the active Rh-Mn nanoparticles with their strong interactions and partially oxidized states on the metastable W2C phases. The W2C phases on the Rh-Mn/WxC leaded to a higher CO conversion of 8.1% and selectivity to higher alcohols of 54.4% with the productivity of C1 –C3 alcohols of 171.8 g/(kgcat·h). The enhanced catalytic performances on the Rh-Mn/WxC(10) were well related with the extents of the exposed surface areas of the smaller active Rh nanoparticles and on the W2C surfaces. The higher productivity of mixed C1- C3 alcohols was also originated from the intimate interactions of the Rh nanoparticles with Mn promoter by maintaining a proper metallic Rh to oxidized Rh n+ surface ratios (Rhn+/Rh0 ratio). The ordered mesoporous and metastable W2C structures largely altered the chemical and electronic states of the smaller Rh nanoparticles to change them into the synergistic surface properties for an enhanced productivity of higher alcohols by CO hydrogenation."
