0,Introduction,"Aerogel refers to porous three-dimensional network solid-state material possessing a series of characteristics such as high porosity, large specific surface area, low density and adjustable surface chemical properties, which is widely used in various fields such as lasers, heat insulation, and environmental protection, energy storage [1]. Through different formation technologies of aerogels where the most common synthetic method is the preparation and drying of the hydrogels, the structures and properties of aerogels have changed diversely. The formation of hydrogel is often the first step in preparation of aerogels. In order to meet the requirements of particular applications, aerogels are allowed to process various size and forms such as membranes, sheets, beads, spheres, blankets, powders, microparticles and coatings through controlling the shapes of the original mixture solutions during the formation of hydrogel [2,3]. Compared with other shapes, the spherical shape exhibits the advantages of high porosity, large specific surface area, suitable density and pore size, which has been widely used in the fields of drug delivery, adsorption and supercapacitors [4,5]. In recent years, compared with inorganic materials and other synthetic polymer materials, polysaccharides have become a widespread research hotspot in aerogel systems due to their good ecological friendliness, biodegradability and biocompatibility. Chitosan, obtained by the deacetylation of chitin, is the only natural polysaccharide with positive charge in nature. Due to the excellent biodegradability, non-toxicity, biocompatibility, antibacterial property and heavy ions adsorption, chitosan is widely used in medicine, food, tissue engineering, environmental protection and other fields [6,7]. And the pH-sensitive characteristics of chitosan are that chitosan is dissolved in only some acid solution but not in neutral and alkaline medium, so that chitosan-based hydrogels can be formed by changing the pH of the solvent medium. Ren et al. reported chitosan aerogel microspheres could be formed through first dropping the chitosan acid solution into NaOH solution to get gelation then freezing-drying the gelation [8]. Anouar and his colleagues prepared similar chitosan-based aerogel beads, which were dried by supercritical carbon dioxide method through the similar process [9]. However, despite these unique advantages, chitosan has some considerable drawbacks, such as unstable yield, poor physical and chemical properties, and lack of process repeatability, which are problematic for the application of high-quality materials. Chemical cross-linking modification is used to improve the stability and mechanical properties of chitosan-based materials, often accompanied by cross-linking agents, such as glutaraldehyde, epoxy resin and so on. However, the residual incompletely reacted cross-linking agents will cause secondary environmental pollution, consume the active functional groups of the chitosan molecules and reduce its application value. Therefore, the suitable physical cross-linking or treatment methods are the way for the further application of chitosan in terms of environmental friendly economic aspects. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a kind of water-soluble polyhydroxy polymer with excellent biocompatibility and non-toxicity, which is frequently regarded as a plasticizer to combine with polymer materials to improve the stability and mechanical strength of the mixed materials [10]. Therefore, the preparation of a new type of biosynthetic polymer by blending chitosan with PVA has broad application prospects for a variety of purposes. Most of the mixture of chitosan and PVA are hydrogels, nanoparticles, electrospinning films and so on. Zhang et al. prepared a chitosan/PVA membranes through electrospinning and studied the effect of PVA content on electrospinnability, indicating that the appropriate PVA content was beneficial to the electrospinnability of chitosan/PVA composite membrane [11]. Chitosan/PVA films were prepared by using bovine serum albumin as model drug, and the films showed good drug delivery and release properties under the effect of condition pH and medium ionic strength [12]. In the aspect of wastewater treatment, chitosan/PVA nanofiber membrane was prepared through electrospinning technology to selectively remove lead and cadmium ions in wastewater [13]. Chitosan/PVA hydrogel was obtained through freezing-thaw method and the swelling, water vapor transmission and mechanical properties of the hydrogel were investigated at optimum content ratio for drug release [14]. Chitosan/PVA aerogels have great potential in many fields, such as medical engineering, tissue engineering, thermal insulation materials, sewage treatment and other fields. Chitosan/PVA aerogels could meet the conditions of drug release and tissue engineering substrates, which require the substrate material to have good biocompatibility and porosity, and the former requires good biodegradability, and the latter requires strong mechanical properties, respectively [15]. Compared with the dried film, chitosan/PVA aerogels have larger specific surface areas, which are more suitable for drug loading and easily affected by environmental media, and can be used in the field of drug release [12,15,16]. Ultra-low shrinkage chitosan/PVA aerogels with good heat insulation and applicable compressive property have potential in thermal insulator in energy-saving buildings [17]. The similar chitosan‑aluminum/PVA aerogel exhibited high mechanical strength, good fire-resistance and smoke-suppressant performance, which is potential substitute for traditional flame-retardant foam [18]. In conclusion, preparation of physically and chemically stable chitosan/PVA aerogels is a very meaningful subject. Another important step in the preparation of aerogels from chitosan-based hydrogel is drying, including supercritical drying, freeze-drying and atmospheric drying. Each method has its own advantages and limits. For example, atmospheric drying is safe and low-cost for large-scale production, but severe capillary tension at the solid-vapor-liquid interface would cause structural shrinkage and collapse. Compared with other drying methods, supercritical drying avoids capillary tension and is beneficial to obtain higher porosity and more uniform structures. However, the disadvantages of incomplete solvent replacement, complicated and time-consuming process, large waste of solvent and high cost hinder the wide application of supercritical drying. Freeze-drying has been preferred over the above two drying techniques for the preparation of chitosan-based aerogels, since it has the advantages of simple operation, relatively affordable, eco-friendly and non-toxic water as the porogen. And the porous structure could be controlled by the freezing rate and precursor concentrations, this is, rapid freezing and high precursor concentration will lead to smaller ice crystals and thus generate the aerogels with small pores and high specific area. Sundararajan et al. reported the pore diameter of pure chitosan aerogels decreased with the increase of chitosan concentration and the decrease of frozen temperature during hydrogel freezing process [19]. Nevertheless, freeze-drying method also has some obvious limitations. During the process of pre-freezing the gelation, improper freezing will lead to expansion and connection of the crystallization solvents, resulting in partial cracking or even collapse of the aerogels, which will severely damage the volume and surface area of pores [1,20]. Moreover, the aerogels with the density below 0.03 g/cm3 are hard to prepare due to the long-time freeze-drying process with ultra-low temperature and ultra-low pressure [21]. Therefore, in order to form chitosan/PVA aerogel microspheres with stable physicochemical properties, the choose of chitosan concentration, PVA content, freezing temperature, freezing time and so on is very important. The aim of this work is to prepare chitosan/PVA aerogels without the addition of other materials. Chitosan/PVA aerogels were obtained by the freeze-drying method and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The effects of PVA content on the physicochemical properties of chitosan/PVA aerogels including swelling, compressive performance and acid-base resistance was investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chitosan (molecular weight is 161.16 kDa and viscosity is 51 mPa·s, degree of deacetylation is 88.0%) and Polyvinyl alcohol (average polymerization degree is 1750 ± 50, degree of alcoholysis is 98.0–99.0%, viscosity is 25.0–31.0 mPa·s) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. No.20120330 (Beijing, China). NaOH, ethanol, K2Cr2O7, HCl and acetic acid were purchased from Beijing Beihua Fine Chemicals Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China). These materials were used without any further purification."
3,Preparation of CS/PVA porous microspheres,"2.2 Preparation of CS/PVA porous microspheres The preparation of CS/PVA porous microspheres is mainly divided into two steps: synthesis of hydrogel microspheres mixed with CS and PVA, and freeze-drying hydrogel microspheres (including pre-freezing process and freeze-drying process). First, 4 g of CS powder was dissolved in 96 g acetic acid (2%, w/w) aqueous solution in a water bath at 60 °C, and continuously stirred for 8 h to prepare a 4 wt% homogeneous chitosan solution. PVA aqueous (12%, w/w) solution was obtained by dissolving 12 g of PVA particles in 88 g of pure water in a water bath at 95 °C and continue stirring for 12 h. Then, CS solution and PVA solution were mixed and stirred to obtain a CS/PVA mixed solution with a mass ratio of CS:PVA = 3:1, 2:1 and 1:1. That is to say, the mass of PVA is 25%, 33% and 50% of dry matter mass, respectively. The mixed solutions were put in an ultrasonic oscillator at 80 Hz for 10 min to remove air bubbles. The mixed solution was dropped into the 1 M NaOH solution through a syringe pump (LSP02-1B, Longer Precision Pump Co., China) microneedle with an inner diameter of 500 μm to prepare CS/PVA hydrogel spheres with the hydrogel ball stirred slowly in the NaOH solution for 1 h to achieve hardening. The solidified CS/PVA hydrogel beads were separated by filtration and with deionized water washed until neutral. A similar control experiment was carried out using pure CS solution without adding PVA water solution. The CS/PVA hydrogel beads were freezing at −20 °C for 12 h before removing the residual water on the beads surface with tissue. After water crystallizing, the fully frozen CS/PVA beads were placed at −70 °C in vacuum environment for 6 h until ice sublimation completely to finish the freeze-drying process, obtaining the CS/PVA porous chitosan microspheres. The CS/PVA-X was used to distinguish microspheres prepared with different mass ratios, where X = 25, 33, 50 means the mass of PVA is 25%, 33% and 50% of dry matter mass (CS/PVA = 3:1, 2:1, and 1:1), respectively."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization 2.3.1 Porosity The porosities of CS/PVA porous microspheres were measured by a liquid displacement method with minor modifications [22]. The prepared CS/PVA porous microspheres were dried to the constant weight in a vacuum oven for 12 h. A certain amount of dried microspheres (W d ) was immersed in 20 mL ethanol and then placed in a vacuum environment to force no more bubbles generating from the microspheres. The wet microspheres were separated by filtration to wipe off the residual ethanol on the surface, and then were quickly transferred into a weighing bottle to record the mass of the wet microspheres (W w ). The volume (V) of the wet microspheres was measured by a glass dilatometer. The density of the porous chitosan microsphere (d), average pore volume V p and porosity P r were calculated according to Eqs. (1)–(3) reported by Fang et al. [23] (1) d = W d V − W w − W d / ρ (2) V p mL / g = V − W d / d W d (3) P r % = V p V p + 1 / d where ρ is the density of ethanol at the test temperature (25 °C). 2.3.2 Scanning electronic microscopy Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) for the surfaces of the CS and CS/PVA porous microspheres were observed using a Zeiss EVO 18 SEM (Zeiss, MERLIN Compact, Germany) after coating the samples with a thin gold layer with the help of gold sputter. 2.3.3 Fourier transform infrared spectra Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of pure chitosan powder, PVA powder, CS and CS/PVA porous chitosan microspheres before or after the adsorption for Cr(VI) were recorded at resolution of 4 cm−1 and 32 scans using a FTIR spectrometer (IRAffinity−1 spectrophotometer, Shimadzu, Japan) in the wavelength range 500–4000 cm−1. The dry samples were grinded with KBr and then pressing them into pellets. 2.3.4 X-ray diffraction X-ray diffraction (XRD) for pure CS, pure PVA, and the prepared CS/PVA porous microspheres has been recorded using Shimadzu XRD-6100 X-ray Diffractometer with Cu (0.154 nm) Kα radiation. And the samples were measured in the 2θ range of 5–40° with the scan speed of 4°/min. 2.3.5 Swelling degree and acid-base resistance The swelling degree of the pure CS and CS/PVA porous microspheres were tested by measuring the water content. A known amount of dried microspheres (W dry ) were submerged in different pH (pH = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12) HCl or NaOH water solutions for 18 h at room temperature. Take out the swollen microspheres and remove the free water on the surface, weight of the wet microspheres (W wet ) was obtained and then the wet microspheres were placed in an environment of 50 °C for 1 h until to get the second dried microspheres (W sdry ). The swelling degree and the acid-base resistance were calculated as follows: (4) Swelling = W wet − W dry W dry (5) Acid − base resistance = W sdry W dry In addition, a similar acid-base resistance experiment to explore the dissolution rate of the microspheres in an HCl solution with pH = 3. This is, the four groups of dry microspheres with known initial mass (W dry ) were immersed in the solution of pH = 3 HCl solutions respectively, and taken out and dried at time t = 0, 2 h, 5 h, 18 h to obtain the relative secondary dry mass (W sdry ). And the related acid-base resistances vs. t were also calculated using the Eq. (5). 2.3.6 Compression performance This study tested the equivalent compressive properties of hydrogel microspheres after freezing-thawing during the preparation process. Since the hydrogel microspheres were ellipsoids, the relate diameters (D) of the maximum roundest cross section and correspondent heights (H) were recorded by a micrometer caliper. Assuming that the largest elliptical cross-section corresponds to the compressed area, compressed to 60% of the corresponding height, the compression performance curve of the hydrogel microspheres is calculated by a texture analyzer."
5,Results and discussion,
6,CS/PVA porous microspheres preparation,"3.1 CS/PVA porous microspheres preparation Fig. 1 presented the preparation process of CS/PVA porous microspheres, including the synthesis of hydrogel beads and the freeze-drying process to prepare porous microspheres. Chitosan is a pH-dependent cationic polymer with abundant active functional groups of amino (−NH2) and hydroxy (-OH) groups. When the pH value of chitosan solution was below its dissociation constant (pKa) of 6.2, chitosan is water-soluble because the protonation of the amino group (-NH2) into -NH3 + results in the chitosan molecular chains unfolding under electrostatic repulsion, which also increases the mobility of molecular chains and weakens the hydrogen bonding between intra- and inter- molecules. At the same time, the basification can generate deprotonation of amino groups and eventually lead to forming a gel of chitosan under hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding. This feature makes the preparation of chitosan hydrogel beads possible. As shown in Fig. 1, the mixture solution of chitosan and PVA with rich hydroxyl groups was dropped into the alkaline solution. Through the neutralization and plasticizing effect of PVA, the CS/PVA hydrogel beads were formed. In this process, the physical and chemical properties of the CS/PVA microspheres were affected by the content of PVA, thus which was used as the independent variable in this study. And then the porous structure of CS/PVA microspheres was obtained by the freeze-drying method with non-toxic water as the porogen."
7,Morphology and porosity of CS/PVA porous microspheres,"3.2 Morphology and porosity of CS/PVA porous microspheres Fig. 2 showed the surface morphology of CS porous microspheres and CS/PVA porous microspheres. It can be observed from Fig. 2a that pure chitosan porous microsphere macroscopically had a condensed thin layer on the surface except for a few ridge-like expansions, and high magnification revealed a highly porous fibrous microstructure with minuscule pore diameter. While CS/PVA porous microspheres had porous spherical structures with uniform size distribution and formed good sphericity as shown in Fig. 2b–d. And the open-pore microstructure with high inter-connectivity and non-uniform orientation were formed in all CS/PVA microspheres. Compared to pure chitosan microspheres, the addition of PVA significantly changed the structure of CS/PVA porous microspheres which had larger pore diameters and more evident, uniform and compact pore structures. These observations indicated that the PVA can dramatically destroy the intra- and inter-molecular structure of pure chitosan chains. Fig. 2b showed that the many large pit-like structure with ravine-like and interconnected pore appeared on the surface of the CS/PVA-25 porous microspheres. It was observed that pore diameters were not uniform and partial pore wall was piled up with a higher magnification. The more uniform pore distribution and thinner pore wall without accumulation can be seen in CS/PVA-33 porous microspheres as shown in Fig. 2c. And there were almost no pit-like structures, but more ridge-like structures appeared. Fig. 2d presented the morphology of CS/PVA-50. The surface of the CS/PVA-50 microspheres became more wrinkled with a smaller pore diameter. Meanwhile, it seemed that material accumulation had occurred at abundant ridge-like structure from the image of X100 magnification. Thus, it can be concluded that the increase of PVA content reduced the pore size of CS/PVA porous polymer, promoted the roughness of the surface and formed more orderly pore distribution. This was agreement with the previous reports [14,24], where a CS/PVA hydrogel films was obtained by the freeze-thawing method, and the higher the chitosan content, the greater the porous size of the hydrogel, suggesting that the entangling between PVA was reduced by chitosan. In this study, compared to pure chitosan microspheres, the more PVA content facilitated entanglement degree between PVA molecular chains and chitosan molecular chains, resulting in better pore structure, and rougher and denser surface morphology, thinner pore wall but thicker ridge-like structures of CS/PVA porous microspheres. On the other hand, the larger connected membrane-like structures appeared on the surface of CS/PVA-33 as shown Fig. 2c. This might be explained that the mixing ratio of 2:1 (CS: PVA) compared to other ratios could produce optimal inter- and intra-molecular connections between PVA and chitosan, and the large membrane-like structure formed under the extrusion of crystal ice. In order to verify this conjecture, the density of CS/PVA microspheres was measured by a liquid displacement method. The densities (d) of CS, CS/PVA-25, CS/PVA-33 and CS/PVA-50 were 0.263 ± 0.011 g/mL, 0.275 ± 0.010 g/mL, 0.294 ± 0.017 g/mL and 0.204 ± 0.015 g/mL, respectively, where the meanings of the density referred to the density of mixed material without pores. It was found that the density of mixture materials first increased and then reduced with the increase of PVA content. If taking the densities of CS and CS/PVA-25 as standard dates, the densities of CS/PVA-50 and CS/PVA-33 should be 0.279 g/mL and 0.287 g/mL, respectively, calculated by interpolation method, which were lower than the actual values of 0.294 g/mL of CS/PVA-33 and much higher than 0.204 g/mL of CS/PVA-50. This indicated that the more PVA participated in the connection and entanglement with chitosan molecular chains in CS/PVA-33 (the ratio of CS/PVA was 2:1), resulting in a large amount of membrane-like structure as shown in SEM images. As for CS/PVA-50 with the lower density, too much PVA leaded to phase separation and partial corrosion in strong alkaline solution after the full reaction between PVA and chitosan [24,25], and when the content of chitosan decreased to 50%, the mass of the hydrogel reduced, which resulted in lower density. And the a large of ridge-like structure as accumulation was another evidence for the conjecture. Interestingly, in this study, there is no uniform pore size or extremely regular structure in the SEM of all CS/PVA aerogels, which means that CS/PVA aerogels with regular pore structures cannot be obtained by direct freeze-drying CS/PVA hydrogels without the addition of other materials. While, in the literature, new types of organic-inorganic composite aerogels were fabricated via the freeze-drying method based on the chemical interaction between bio-based chitosan and aluminum chloride, in combination with physical cross-linking among chitosan, inexpensive PVA and alumina sols derived from the acidic hydrolysis of aluminum isopropoxide. The organic-inorganic aerogel exhibited a layered porous structure in the cross section and a parallel herringbone-like structure in the longitudinal section [18]. In order to obtain the CS/PVA aerogels with uniform pore size and pore shape, the effect of inorganic ingredients on the pore structure of CS/PVA composite aerogels prepared by freeze-drying method will be carried out in the further study. Porosity plays an important role in the practical application of porous materials. For instance, the high porosities of chitosan-based porous adsorbents can not only provide better fluidity of the solution to facilitate the transportation of the adsorbate, but also provide a large specific surface for the adsorption of the adsorbates, so that more active functional groups can participate in the adsorption reaction. And the better mechanical properties of the aerogel skeletons can be obtained with the smaller pore size and the thicker pore wall [26], which also directly influence the porosity. Fig. 3 presented the porosities of CS and CS/PVA porous microsphere. The porosity of CS was 61.6%, while the porosity of CS/PVA microspheres was much higher than the pure chitosan microspheres. However, it was evident that with the PVA content increasing the porosities increased first and then decreased. The porosity of CS/PVA-33 microspheres was the biggest (78.3%). It can be obtained from the SEM results that PVA disrupted the compact structure of pure chitosan polymer, significantly reduced the entanglement between inter- and intra- molecules of the chitosan, and during the preparation process the large number of hydroxyl groups of PVA absorbed more water molecules which acted as a pore-forming agent in freeze-drying. Interestingly, the porosity of CS/PVS-25 porous microspheres was not the maximum, which can be interpreted that more PVA resulted in the etching of partial PVA and phase separation, and the strong interaction between PVA and chitosan caused thickening in partial region of the polymer. Although there was no significant difference of porosity between CS/PVA porous microspheres, the PVA can dramatically improve the porosity of pure chitosan material."
8,FTIR analysis,"3.3 FTIR analysis In order to assess the chemical groups between CS and PVA and investigate the synthesis mechanism of CS/PVA porous microspheres, the FTIR spectra of chitosan powder, chitosan porous microspheres, CS/PVA microspheres and pure PVA powder were obtained and shown in Fig. 4 . The FTIR spectrum of PVA had a broad band at 3300–3800 cm−1 wavenumbers assigned to hydroxyl groups (OH) stretching vibration with strong hydrogen bonding between the intra-molecular or inter-molecular of PVA and other several characteristic peaks at 2930 cm−1 related to CH stretching and 1736 cm−1 assigned to CO stretching vibration due to the no-complete hydrolysis [25,27]. FTIR spectrum of chitosan powder included several peaks at 1647 cm−1, 1593 cm−1 and 1321 cm−1 attributed to amide I (CO stretching), amide II (NH bending), amide III (CN stretching), respectively. The peak at 2930 cm−1 was attributed to CH stretching vibration and a strong broad peak appears at 3362 cm−1 which is due to OH stretching vibration overlapped by stretching NH with strong inter-molecular hydrogen bonding of chitosan molecular [28]. And another region ranged from 1000 cm−1 to 1200 cm−1, 1026 cm−1 and 1083 were related to CO (stretching), and 1159 cm−1 was related to C-O-C (asymmetric stretching) [29]. After the chitosan powder was prepared into chitosan porous microspheres, a transfer from 3362 cm−1 to the higher wavenumber (3366 cm−1) with the decrease in the intensity was observed, indicating that inter-molecular hydrogen bonding of chitosan molecular was weaker after the process, which could be explained by that hydrogen bonding decreased the frequency of stretching vibration and increased that of bending vibration [30]. The reason was that in the process of dissolving chitosan in acetic acid, the protonation of amine groups (-NH3 +) broken the originally stable intra- or inter-molecular hydrogen, which resulted in the dissolution of chitosan and even acidolysis that led to a decrease in molecular weight of chitosan and formation of weaker hydrogen-bond interaction. In the microsphere formation process, water molecules were also involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds with -NH2 or -OH of chitosan molecule chain, resulting in a decrease in the density of the hydrogen bond between -NH2 and -OH, and the rearrangement of chitosan molecule chain leaded to a weakening of hydrogen bonds. An evidence was observed that the peak of amino groups (-NH2) at 1593 cm−1 was shifted to 1601 cm−1 with a decreasing intensity, which implied the protonation of amine groups (-NH3 +) [25] and weaker hydrogen-bond interaction. The IR spectra of CS/PVA porous microspheres presented in Fig. 4 were different from that of CS porous microspheres. After the addition of PVA, the peak at 3366 cm−1 signature for NH or OH stretching vibration, 1647 cm−1 signature for -CONH stretching vibration and 1076 cm−1 signature for CO stretching vibration all shifted to a higher frequency, while the adsorption peak at 1601 cm−1 related to NH bending vibration shifted to a lower wavenumber, which indicated that after the addition of PVA weaker interaction formed between chitosan molecule and the strong interaction occurred between amino groups (-NH2) of chitosan and hydroxyl groups (-OH) of PVA. A distinct new peak at 862 cm−1 was generated confirming the reaction occurred between chitosan and PVA and the successful preparation of the CS/PVA porous microspheres, which could be proved by the SEM results. In addition, it was observed that with the increase of PVA, the N-H/O-H peak at 3420 cm−1 transferred to a lower wavenumber at 3367 cm−1 for the CS/PVA microspheres, implying the creation of stronger bonds between components with the increase of PVA [25]. Additionally, the crystallization should give changes in the whole frequency region with similar spectral changing or appearance of sharp bands doing occur [31,32]. The crystalline-sensitive band of chitosan powder at 1026 cm−1 almost disappeared in chitosan porous microsphere and CS/PVA porous microspheres, as the result of hydrogen bonding of chitosan with acetic acid and PVA [33], indicating worse crystallization of the microspheres occurring, which was also confirmed by the XRD analysis."
9,XRD analysis,"3.4 XRD analysis The XRD patterns of pure PVA, chitosan powder and the prepared CS and CS/PVA porous microspheres were depicted in Fig. 5 . The PVA diffraction pattern presented three major peaks at 19.7° 22.1° and 37.7°, which were the crystalline parts of PVA molecules due to the strong intra- or inter-molecular hydrogen bonding, and other broad region presented amorphous structure, which indicated that PVA was semi-crystalline [34,35]. Similarly, there were two characteristic peaks of the pure chitosan powder located at 19.3° (strong and broad) and 37.7° (medium and sharp) resulting from the crystalline phase. On the contrary, most other regions were related to the primary amorphous phase, which was agreement with the results reported in the literatures [36,37]. After the chitosan powder was prepared into CS porous microspheres, the peak at 2θ = 20.1° had a slight shift with significantly decreased intensity, which indicated the degree of crystallinity reduced. So the formation process of chitosan microspheres could reduce the crystallinity of chitosan powder, which can be interpreted as the result that the dissolution of chitosan in an acidic environment, resulting in vast protonation of -NH2 into -NH3 +, unfolding the chitosan molecular chain due to electrostatic repulsion and weaker hydrophobic interactions, even resulting in acidolysis of chitosan molecular chains, finally destroyed the original stable intra-/inter molecular hydrogen bond structure, and the rearranged molecular chain became more disordered [38,39]. After the addition of PVA, there was no obvious change for the diffraction pattern of CS/PVA porous microspheres compared to that of CS porous microspheres. But in comparison with the chitosan powder, the crystallinity of porous microspheres had decreased, which was in agreement with the FTIR results. The reason might be that although PVA could not dramatically make three-dimensional polymer network more stable and ordered, it could strengthen the entanglement of chitosan molecular chains [24,40]. In other words, PVA cannot significantly affect the crystallization performance of CS/PVA porous microspheres prepared by acid dissolution, alkali molding and freeze-drying process. In addition, the crystallinity of the materials played a crucial role on influencing swelling property, mechanical property, acid-base resistance, which were elaborated as follows [25]."
10,Swelling and acid-base resistance,"3.5 Swelling and acid-base resistance The swelling and acid-base resistance are important factors which influence the practicability of aerogels in complex mediums. Therefore, the swelling and acid-resistance tests of the CS and CS/PVA porous microspheres were carried out in HCl or NaOH aqueous solution with different pH value for 18 h. Fig. 6a illustrated the swelling ratio of CS and CS/PVA porous microspheres after acid or alkali water treatment. All the porous microspheres showed high swelling ratios (>400%) and there was no appreciable volume increase in visual inspection. The higher PVA content was, the greater the swelling degree of the CS/PVA porous microspheres was, which can be interpreted that hydrogen bonding could be formed not only between the hydrophilic groups (-OH) of PVA molecular chains and -OH or -NH2 of chitosan molecular chains, but also between water molecules, making a large number of water molecules be stabilized in CS or CS/PVA molecules under the action of hydrogen bonding and thus cause swelling phenomenon. This fact was attributed to more hydrophilic groups (-OH) from PVA appearing in the polymer. On the other hand, some studies [14,24,25] reported the higher PVA content (the major ingredient) and the lower CS content in CS/PVA polymer could enhance the physical entanglement between chitosan and PVA molecular by consumption of hydrophilic functional groups through hydrogen bonding, resulting in a more compact structure and/or higher crystallinity, thereby reducing the mobility of the polymer molecular chains and the chance of water molecular entering the polymer interior through the amorphous region. The main reason was that cross-linked hydrogel produced by chitosan was less than PVA [14]. That meaned chitosan destroyed the compact structure of PVA hydrogel. However, the swelling rate of the above-mentioned chitosan/PVA polymers showed different trends with the increase of PVA content, indicating that in this study the major ingredient was chitosan, and the PVA mainly destroy the compact structure of pure chitosan by increasing the dissolution of chitosan chains [11,24] and increased the cross-linking degree between chitosan molecules of CS/PVA polymers. Meanwhile, a large number of hydrophilic hydroxyl groups(-OH) were incorporated into the CS/PVA polymer with high porosity to absorb more water molecular. It could be assumed that the effect of hydrophilic hydroxyl on swelling performance is much more significant that the crystallinity or compactness of the structure. On the other hand, the swelling rate under alkaline conditions was slightly higher than that under acidic condition, which was due to the fact that much more -NH2 and -OH were protonated into -NH3 + and -OH2 + of polymer under acidic conditions, and less water was adsorbed through hydrogen bonding, resulting in lower swelling rate. In order to estimate whether the CS or CS/PVA porous microspheres could be used in all pH environment, an acid-base resistance test, similar to swelling test with a drying process, was carried out. Fig. 6b presented the acid-base resistance of CS and CS/PVA porous microspheres after soaking in pH > 4 solution for 18 h. Briefly, the acid resistance of the microspheres was CS/PVA-50 > CS/PVA-33 > pure CS > CS/PVA-25, and the mass retention rate was more than 90% at 4 < pH < 6 and more that 85% at 8 < pH < 12, indicating the microspheres had good acid-base resistance. Compared to CS/PVA-25, pure CS microspheres showed better acid-base resistance, which indicated that the addition of PVA even a small amount destroyed the original compact structure of pure chitosan polymer microspheres, and reduced the chemical stability of composite materials. The increase of PVA content could change this phenomenon and increase acid resistance of CS/PVA microspheres. Interestingly, the acid-base resistance of pure CS microspheres in alkaline solution was better than that in acidic solution, which indicated the solubility of chitosan was much higher under acidic condition. However, the same phenomenon did not occur in CS/PVA microspheres. The acid-base resistance of CS/PVA-25 remained basically unchanged, except that it was significantly increased at pH of 12. The acid-base resistance of CS/PVA-50 and CS/PVA-33 were lower under alkaline condition, and the reason might be that the acid strength was not enough to significantly affect the dissolution of the soluble chitosan entangled by PVA, and excessive PVA would lead to the dissolution of some PVA components in alkaline medium. On the contrary, the acid-base resistance of CS/PVA microspheres was closely related to its swelling performance. The higher the swelling degree was, the worse the acid-base resistance at pH > 4 was due to more water molecules injected into the polymer molecules. Water molecules destroyed the hydrogen bonds between polymers, leading to the hydrolysis of polymers. Fig. 6c and d presented the acid resistance of CS microspheres and CS/PVA microspheres at pH of 2 and 3 respectively. It was verified that low pH (<3) notably influenced the stability of the microspheres, in which the PVA content increased from 0 to 50%, the acid resistance increased from 0 to 52% at pH of 2 and from 67% to 85% at pH of 3. These results indicated that the dissolution of the chitosan component was the main reason for the acid resistance of the polymers, and PVA could improve the acid stability of the polymer. CS/PVA microspheres still possessed the practicality at pH of 3, but lost their practicability at pH of 2. In short, all the porous microspheres prepared in this study had good acid-base resistance and could be used in the solution of pH > 3, and adding proper amount of PVA into the CS/PVA microspheres could improve their acid resistance, but reduce their alkali resistance."
11,Compression performance,"3.6 Compression performance Good compression performance provides a more stable structure in complex application environment. The influence of PVA content on the compression performance of CS/PVA hydrogel beads was investigated by a compression test. As shown in Fig. 7 , since all kinds of CS and CS/PVA beads were not perfectly spherical from the front view, but the largest and roundest cross sections were observed from the top view. Thus, the area of the cross section (the diameter, D) was regarded as the equivalent compressed area and the height (the height, H) perpendicular to the cross-section was the maximum compression height. Table 1 showed the D and H of all kinds of beads and their compression performance when the degree of compression was up to 60% of H. It suggested that compression strength increased from 0.0321 MPa to 0.0505 MPa when the mass ratio of CS/PVA was changed from 3:0 to 2:1, and then decreased to 0.0418 MPa when the mass ratio of CS/PVA was 3:3. These results indicated that the mechanical strength of the hybrid microspheres was much better than that of pure chitosan. However, the addition of proper amount of PVA controlled the best mechanical strength, which were confirmed by the cross-linking reaction occurring in SEM analysis, where PVA could make the entanglement of chitosan chains closer and bring better mechanical properties, but excessive PVA would also form phase separation during the gelation process and cause partial PVA corrosion, thereby reducing the mechanical properties. In this study, the maximum value observed at CS:PVA of 2:1 may be related to the overall balance between amine and hydroxyl reaction, which was caused by the formation of a rigid structure between the CS/PVA chains, notably increasing its compression performance."
12,Conclusion,"Aim at green and environmental friendly protection, CS and CS/PVA porous microspheres including a large number of hydroxy and amine groups were prepared through gelation and freeze-drying process without any other reagents. Compared to pure CS microspheres, the addition of PVA significantly increased the porosity of the microspheres and destroyed the compact structure. However, too much PVA resulted in the phase separation and partial dissolution of PVA, while too little PVA caused the aggregation of chitosan molecules. The appropriate addition amount of PVA (CS/PVA of 2:1) promoted better entanglement and reaction between PVA and chitosan, and provided the maximum porosity, better acid-base resistance and compression performance to avoid the dissolution of chitosan. A chemically and physically stable chitosan/PVA aerogel was successfully prepared. The aerogel could be used in heavy ions adsorption for sewage treatment fields, biocompatibility and drug release for medical field."
