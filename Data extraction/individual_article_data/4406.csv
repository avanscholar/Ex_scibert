0,Introduction,"With increasing concerns about the depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution, hydrogen has been regarded as the most promising energy carrier in transportation and domestic applications [1–3]. Nowadays, hydrogen is mainly produced by hydrocarbons and/or alcohols reforming. Among various hydrocarbon feed stocks, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) appears as the attractive feedstock for hydrogen and/or syngas formation, due to their existing distribution and supply infrastructure [4–6]. Hydrogen and syngas are the basic raw materials to produce synthetic liquid fuels (SLFS) and chemicals via the industrially available processes [7,8]. LPG is a mixture of petroleum gases that exists in a liquid state at ambient temperatures under moderate pressures (less than 1.5MPa). It is inexpensive and mainly consists of propane in many countries such as U.S./Canadian LPG [9,10]. Hence, propane has also been accepted as a practical feedstock for hydrogen production due to its abundance and its well-established infrastructure in modern cities. Up to date, steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX), oxidative steam reforming (OSR) and dry reforming (CO2 reforming) are the major routes for hydrogen and/or syngas production from propane [11–14]. Most studies have focused on the steam reforming of propane using supported Ni, Co, Ru and Pd catalysts operated at relatively high temperatures, typically 500–700°C [15–17]. Among these catalysts, noble metals are the more efficient system compared to the transition metals with respect to propane conversion and hydrogen selectivity, probably due to their strong capacity for breaking the CC bond of propane. Zapf et al. [10] applied Rh nanoparticles as precursors to prepare Rh/Al2O3 catalysts for propane steam reforming. No obvious deactivation was observed during 140h long-term test. In the recent studies of Shen group [18–21], a novel Ir/CeO2 system has been developed for ethanol reforming, which exhibited excellent activity/stability at relatively low temperatures even under the stoichiometric feed conditions. It has frequently been shown that support also plays a critical role in the activity/selectivity and stability of the catalyst for hydrocarbon or alcohol reforming [22–25]. In this respect, the excellent performances of CeO2-supported catalysts known as the high catalytic activity and resistance against carbon deposition, have been tentatively related to the high OSC of CeO2 and to the strong interaction between CeO2 and the supported active metal [26]. Insertion of Zr4+ into the CeO2 lattice structure might result in structural distortions of the CeO2 fluorite lattice and improve its OSC, thermal stability and resistance to sintering. Since the ionic radius of Zr4+ is smaller than the value of Ce4+, it can contribute to remove the strain associated with the increase of size during the Ce4+ to Ce3+ transition, and therefore to enhance the CeO2 redox capacity and facilitate the oxygen mobility [26,27]. Computer simulation studies revealed that even small addition of ZrO2 greatly promoted bulk Ce4+ reduction compared to pure CeO2 [28]. In fact, the high OSC of cubic Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 can increase the availability of surface oxygen, which is favorable for the WGS reaction increasing the H2 yield in reformation reactions [29]. As to CeO2 ZrO2 supports, the Ce/Zr molar ratio plays an important role in the catalytic behavior in reforming processes. Roh et al. [30] investigated the influence of Ce/Zr ratio for ethanol steam reforming over Rh/CeO2 ZrO2 catalyst. Rh/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 presented the highest H2 and CO2 yield and the lowest deactivation rate due to the less formation of carbon deposits. Hence, a study of ethanol steam reforming over Ni/Ce1−x Zr x O2 (x =0,0.26, 0.59, 0.84,1) indicated that Ni/Ce0.74Zr0.26O2 sample exhibited the highest activity, which was due to it having the most reduced nickel available for reaction [29]. Taking into account the recent results regarding ethanol reforming together with the background of the application of CeO2 ZrO2-supported catalysts in the reforming of bio-butanol raw mixture [26], here we further investigate steam reforming of propane over Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst (Ce/Zr=3 molar ratio). The reason why we selected this Ce/Zr molar ratio was due to the guidance of the previous literatures [29,30]. Hence, the aim of this work is to elucidate the main parameters that influence the behavior of Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 sample in propane steam reforming. Catalysts were tested at initial conversion values lower than 100% and this allowed to following the deactivation. In order to establish the possible structure-catalytic performance relationship, catalysts were characterized using: TPR, XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), CO2 temperature programmed desorption (CO2–TPD), followed by HRTEM."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 support (Ce/Zr=3 molar ratio) was prepared by co-precipitation of ammonia cerium nitrate and zirconium nitrate with urea in aqueous solution. Firstly, the mixture of (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6, Zr(NO3)4·5H2O and urea was dissolved into deionied water and then gradually heated to 90°C under stirring and kept at this temperature for 6h. After filtration and thorough washing with water, the precipitate was dried overnight at 100°C and further calcined at 400°C for 5h in static air. Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst with an Ir nominal loading of 2wt.% was synthesized by a deposition–precipitation method. The as-prepared Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 powders were suspended in aqueous solution containing appropriate amounts of Ir precursor (H2IrCl6∙6H2O), and the mixture was heated to 75°C under continuous stirring. A 0.25M Na2CO3 aqueous solution was gradually added until the pH value of the mixture reached 9.0, followed by further aging at 75°C for 1h, during which the precipitate was exclusively deposited onto the CeO2 surface. After filtration and washing with water, the obtained solid was dried at 100°C overnight and finally calcined at 400°C for 5h in static air."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The actual metal content in Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst was analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectrometer (PLASMA-SPEC-II). XRD patterns were recorded using a Rigaku D/MAX-RB diffractor with Cu Kα radiation source operating at 40kV and 100mA. The mean crystallite sizes of ceria were calculated according to the Scherrer equation [31]. OSC of the as-prepared catalysts was measured using the oxygen pulse injection method. Before analysis, the samples (50mg) were reduced with H2/Ar (12vol.%, 50mL/min) at 800°C. Then, they were cooled to 300°C under Ar flow (50mL/min). A stream of O2/He (10vol.%) was periodically injected into the reduced sample until saturation and accordingly the oxygen consumption was calculated. HRTEM images were obtained using Philips Tecnai G220 microscope operating at 300kV. Specimens were prepared by ultrasonically suspending the sample in ethanol. A drop of the suspension was deposited to a thin carbon film supported on a standard copper grid and dried in air. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded at −196°C using a Nova 4200e instrument (Quantachrome). Before the measurement, the sample was outgassed at 300°C for 2h. The specific surface area was calculated by multipoint BET analysis of the nitrogen adsorption isotherms. H2–TPR was preformed with a Micromeritics AutoChem. II chemisorption analyzer. About 40mg catalyst sample was pretreated at 100°C for 1h under flowing He (50mL/min). After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was exposed to a flow of 12vol.% H2/Ar (50mL/min), and the temperature was increased linearly at 10°C/min. XPS was measured on a KRATOS AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer and an Al anode (Al Kα =1486.6eV) powered at 150W. The C1s peak at 284.6eV was used as an internal standard for peak position measurement. The areas of the peaks were estimated by calculating the integrality of each peak after subtracting a Shirley background and fitting the experimental peak to a combination of Lorentzian/Gaussian lines of variable proportions. CO2–TPD experiment was carried out using a flow system equipped with a mass spectrometry. Prior to the experiment, the sample was pretreated at 300°C for 1h in Ar. Then it was cooled down and CO2 was adsorbed at 25°C. After being purged with Ar to remove the weakly adsorbed CO2, the sample was heated again from 25°C to 800°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min in Ar flow. The signal of desorption CO2 was monitored online with mass spectrometry (INFICON IPC400). The formation of the carbonaceous deposits during steady-state catalytic experiments was quantified by TPO of the aged catalyst. 100mg of the used catalyst was loaded in a microreactor and the system was heated from 25°C to 700°C at a rate of 5°C/min with a flow of 5vol.% O2/Ar mixture (100mL/min). The effluents were analyzed by on-line mass spectrometry (Inficon quadrupole)."
4,Catalytic measurements,"2.3 Catalytic measurements Propane steam reforming was carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (100mg) (grain size 40–60mesh) was loaded and sandwiched by two quartz wool layers. Prior to reaction, the catalyst was reduced with 5vol.% H2/Ar (100mL/min) at 400°C for 1h. Water was fed by a micro-pump to a vaporizer heated to 200°C. The flow rate of propane was regulated by a mass flow controller. The effluent from the reactor was analyzed by online gas chromatography. H2, CO, and CO2 were separated by a packed column (HayeSep D) and analyzed by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using He as carrier gas. Hydrocarbons were separated with a capillary column (INNOWAX) and analyzed with a flame ionization detector (FID). Propane conversion, product concentrations were calculated and listed as follows: Propane conversion is calculated according to: X propane ={[∑n*(Ci)outlet]−[3*(Cpropane)outlet]}/[∑n*(Ci)outlet] (eq. 1) with (Ci)outlet: molar concentration of carbon containing species (labeled as i) in the outlet gas. n =1 for CO, CO2 and CH4; n =3 for C3H8, C3H6 The molar concentration of hydrogen in the outlet dry gas (except water) is calculated according to: C*H2 =(CH2)outlet/[(CH2)outlet +∑(Ci)outlet] (eq. 2) Molar concentrations of carbon containing species (labeled as i) in the outlet dry gas (except water) are calculated according to: C*i =(Ci)outlet/[(CH2)outlet +∑(Ci)outlet] (eq. 3) with (CH2)outlet: molar concentration of hydrogen in the outlet gas."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characteristics of the catalyst,"3.1 Characteristics of the catalyst ICP analysis revealed that the amount of Ir in the Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 sample was 1.95wt.%, as targeted. BET surface area of the catalyst was measured to be 160m2/g. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst. For the as-prepared catalyst, diffraction peaks assigned to cubic phase CeO2 were observed (JCPDS 00-034-0394). Moreover, major diffraction angle (111) shifted from 28.5° to 28.9° compared to Ir/CeO2 sample [32]. The other peaks also shifted to higher degree, probably due to the lattice shrinking of Ce4+ caused by the incorporation of Zr4+ which accounted for the evidence that the ionic radius of Zr4+ (0.083nm) was lower than the value of Ce4+ (0.097nm) [33]. It indicated the formation of CeO2 ZrO2 solid solution. The absence of Ir diffraction peaks suggested that a very small crystalline size of IrO2 particle resulting from a strong interaction between IrO2 and CeO2 ZrO2 support, was not detectable by X-ray technique. The average crystalline size of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 support was estimated to be about 7nm. HRTEM image of the as-prepared Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst is shown in Fig. 2 . The sizes of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 particles were in the range of 5–7nm, in good agreement with XRD and BET measurements. Spherical support particles were poorly crystalline, and their composites were oriented randomly and interfaced epitaxially. Ir particles were difficult to see in line with XRD analysis probably due to the strong background influence of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 support or their small sizes. OSC value of the Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst indicated a strong interaction between Ir and support. Oxygen uptake was 292μmolO2/g for the pure support and 688μmol O2/g for the Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst. In fact, Ce x Zr1−x O2 is known to possess an intrinsically high OSC, and the addition of noble metals could promote this property significantly [34,35]. This capacity is associated to the storage/release of oxygen via the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox cycle. The particular role of the noble metal in OSC enhancement remains a matter of debate. One possible explanation was that part of the added noble metal formed small oxide clusters within the CeO2 fluorite structure, acting as privileged pathway for oxygen storage and diffusion [36]. Fig. 3 compares the TPR profiles of the Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst and the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 support. TPR profiles of pure Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 support mainly exhibited two reduction peaks, appearing at 281°C (H2 consumption: 282μmol/g) and 469°C (H2 consumption: 556μmol/g), respectively. It was known that no obvious reduction of ZrO2 was observed below 600°C [37,38]. Hence, the above two peaks were assigned to the reduction of surface CeO2. With the addition of Ir, the reduction temperature of the mixed oxide shifted to the lower temperature region. The reduction peak at 132°C was attributed to the combined reduction of Ir oxide and the partial surface CeO2 because H2 consumption (1147μmol/g) was much larger than the amount of hydrogen required for the stoichiometric reduction of IrO2 to Ir (211μmol/g). Another peak at 350°C (257μmol/g) was also attributed to the reduction of surface CeO2 that might be a little far from the active metal Ir. Hence, the presence of Ir greatly facilitated the reduction of CeO2, indicating a strong interaction between Ir and CeO2. The promotion of CeO2 reduction by noble metal was due to the hydrogen spill-over phenomenon [28]. Indeed, it was supposed that hydrogen, once dissociated on metallic Ir, was able to spill over to the support and reduce it at lower temperatures. Evaluating the H2 consumption, it indicated that Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (1393μmol/g) was much higher than the value of Ir/CeO2 catalyst (1195μmol/g) [32]. This result was in good agreement with the previous findings [39], suggesting that the presence of ZrO2 favored the reduction of CeO2 due to the higher oxygen mobility in lattice and the creation of vacancies. The chemical species presented on the catalyst surfaces were also evaluated by XPS technique. The energy regions of Ir4f, Ce3d core levels in oxidized and reduced samples were recorded. As shown in Fig. 4 a. The Ir4f spectrum of the oxidized sample presented a doublet centered at around 61.7eV and 64.7eV, which corresponded to the binding energy of IrO2 species. The spectra of the reduced sample exhibited a doublet centered at 60.6eV and 63.6eV, characteristic of the binding energy of metallic Ir. It indicated that most of the Ir oxide species were reduced to metallic Ir after reduction at 400°C. As presented in Fig. 4b, the curves of Ce3d spectra were composed of eight peaks corresponding to four pairs of spin-orbit doublets. Letters u and v referred to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 spin-orbit components, respectively. The peaks marked as u, u” and u”' were assigned to Ce4+3d3/2, while the peaks labeled as v, v” and v”’ were attributed to Ce4+3d5/2. The peaks of u’ and v’ were assigned to Ce3+ species [40]. The proportion of Ce3+ with respect of total cerium was calculated according to the procedure of [41]: Ce ( III ) ( % ) = 100 × [ s ( u ' ) + s ( v ' ) ] Σ [ s ( u ) + s ( v ) ] The relative concentration of Ce3+ species drastically increased from 15.9% (oxidized sample) to 28.2% (reduced sample). As reported in the literature [42], the presence of Ce3+ was associated with the formation of oxygen vacancies. More oxygen vacancies facilitated the water activation in hydrocarbon reforming. It also favored not only the diffusion of bulk oxygen to CeO2 surface but also the surface transfer of OH groups and/or oxygen which was helpful for the coke removal. The basicities of the samples were evaluated by means of CO2 TPD. As shown in Fig. 5 , three main CO2 desorption peaks separately located at ca.160°C(LT), 362°C(MT) and 683°C(HT) were observed in the CO2 TPD profile of the Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 sample [43]. These desorption zones were related to the strength of basic sites on which CO2 was chemisorbed. The LT peak was attributed to the formation of hydrogencarbonates resulting from the interaction of CO2 with weak basicity hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support. The MT peak corresponded to the formation of bridged and bidentate carbonates, and it was associated with the presence of M x+…O2− pairs of intermediate basic strength. The HT peak could tentatively be assigned to the formation of relatively stable carbonates coming from the reaction of low coordination O2− ions with CO2 [44]. It was known that basic sites could efficiently inhibit carbon formation to guaranty the catalyst stability [45].From the above characterization results, one could conclude that Ir species were highly dispersed on the support surface and the redox capacity of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 support was greatly enhanced due to the strong interaction between Ir and support. In fact, the Ir-support interaction might accelerate the catalyst activity in propane steam reforming for hydrogen production. Fig. 6 shows the distribution of the product concentrations calculated at equilibrium (by minimizing the free energy of formation) for further comparison with the experimental data. Propane is converted completely over the whole temperature range. Upon heating, hydrogen concentration increases and reaches a maximum at around 700°C, simultaneously coinciding with the total disappearance of methane. CO2 concentration also presents a maximum at ca. 580°C and steadily declines at higher temperature. CO develops only at high temperature, as expected from the reverse water gas shift reaction. No other C3 or C2 products are observed, being not stable enough thermodynamically. Fig. 7 presents the evolution of the propane conversion and the product concentrations as a function of the reaction temperature for propane steam reforming over Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst. It was obvious that both propane conversion and hydrogen concentration increased progressively with the temperature. At 700°C, hydrogen concentration in the outlet gas could be achieved to about 76mol%. Concerning the distribution of C-containing products, significant amount of CO2 was formed at the lower temperature probably due to the water gas shift reaction. That was also why only trace amount of CO (2.5mol%) was observed at 450°C. However, with further heating, both rapid increase of CO concentration and gradual decrease in the CO2 formation was observed indicating that the reverse water gas shift reaction, which was thermodynamically feasible, occurred. Upon heating, the amount of methane drastically declined due to methane steam reforming, as predicted by thermodynamics. At 700°C, methane was almost completely reformed into hydrogen and CO. About 1–1.5mol% C3H6 was observed over the entire temperature range probably coming from propane dehydration reaction. In the present case, additional experiments have been carried out with Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 support or under blank conditions in order to elucidate the reactions caused by the support and the contribution from gas-phase reactions. The results are shown in Fig. 8 . C3H8 conversion drastically decreased with only Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 support or under blank conditions. The related hydrogen concentration followed the similar trend remaining substantially lower than the value obtained over Ir catalyst. This indicated that: (i) surface reactions were in any case much faster and more selective than gas phase ones; (ii) heterogeneous reactions, taking place on Ir or Ir-support interfaces, are the main contribution to the formation of H2 and propane conversion. In the previous studies of Shen group [19,21], active metal Ir exhibited excellent CC bond dissociation capacity, which could enhance ethanol conversion. Hence, with the addition of Ir, it also could accelerate propane conversion to C1 products and hydrogen. In order to further investigate the improvement of Zr addition, the reforming process has also been studied over Ir/CeO2, Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, Ir/ZrO2 catalysts. The results were presented in Fig. 9 . Among the catalyst examined, Ir/ZrO2 sample was the least active and selective. It was known that ZrO2 support did not possess OSC like CeO2 support which was crucial for the activation of H2O and diffusion of intermediates to Ir-support surface [18]. Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity and hydrogen selectivity. It was probably assigned to its higher OSC, oxygen mobility and support defects after the addition of Zr into CeO2 support. The development of stable catalyst is one of the most important issues in hydrogen production from propane, particularly with stoichiometric feed compositions where no excess water is available to remove carbon deposits that are detrimental to the catalyst stability. Long-term stability test of propane steam reforming over Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst was conducted. As predicted in Fig. 10 , propane conversion decreased from about 95% to 87% during the initial period of 10–12h on stream, then both propane conversion and product concentrations almost kept constant over the all remaining testing period. The concentrations of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 in the outlet stream were about 67mol%, 9mol%, 14mol% and 8mol%, respectively. In order to further elucidate the excellent stability of the investigated system, several characterizations (XRD, HRTEM, TPO) were done on the aged catalysts. Fig. 1(b) shows the XRD patterns of the used Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst. No diffraction reflexes of Ir species were observed as before testing, providing evidence that no aggregation or sintering of Ir particles occurred during the stability tests. The particle size of CeO2 increased to about 16nm during the course of reaction. The small CeO2 nanoparticles with high surface energy in the fresh catalyst tended to aggregate into larger particles under the reaction conditions, similar to a hydrothermal process. Fig. 11 presents the HRTEM images of the used catalyst. Along with the increase in particle size, the morphology of the support particles also shifted from spherical in the as-prepared sample to polygonal crystallite cubes after the tests. As for Ir species, they could be observed on the aged samples (at variance with the fresh one) because CeO2 particles were sintered enough to allow us to differentiate Ir from Ce aggregates. The observed Ir particles presented a mean size in the 2–3nm range indicating that they were still highly dispersed on the support surface, maintaining sufficient Ir-support interfacial areas where the reaction occurred. No serious sintering of Ir species was observed after stability test. This demonstrated that the strong Ir-support interaction efficiently prevented sintering of the Ir particles during the long-term test. No obviously carbonaceous deposits were observed in the HRTEM images indicating that the equilibrium between the coke deposition and its gasification during the reaction has been established. Mattos et al. [46] considered that the high amount of CeO2 support oxygen vacancies near the metal particles promoted the carbon removal from the metallic surface, which took place at the metal-support interfacial perimeter. TPO experiment was also performed in order to detect eventual carbonaceous formation over the aged catalyst. Fig. 12 shows the TPO profile of the used catalyst for propane steam reforming at 600°C. It was apparent that CO2 was produced mainly at about 236°C by the oxidation of easy oxidized carbon deposits. The observation of small shoulder at higher temperature might be related to the more stable carbon deposits such as C3H6 which would be precursor of stable polymeric coke. However, the total amount of carbon was almost negligible (0.31mgC/gcat/h). Based on the above results, it is elucidated that the strong Ir-support interaction efficiently prevents active metal Ir sintering and coke formation, thus guaranteeing the catalyst stability."
7,Conclusion,"Ir/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst was shown to be highly active and stable for propane steam reforming, even with a stoichiometric feed composition at 600°C for 65h on stream. There was no obvious deactivation with a constant effluent gas composition. The doping of ZrO2 into the CeO2 lattice greatly improved the redox property of the CeO2 by creating more surface oxygen vacancies. Structural analysis of the aged catalysts indicated that the 2–3nm Ir particles remained highly dispersed on the enlarged support particles. Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 support probably prevented the highly dispersed Ir particles from sintering and effectively inhibited coke deposition through the strong Ir-support interaction."
