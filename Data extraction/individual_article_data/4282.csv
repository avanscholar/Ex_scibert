0,Introduction,"The search for processes to provide alternative feedstock for chemicals and fuels, and particularly high value mixed linear α-alcohols and high quality diesel fuels, has been prompted by the potential shortage of traditional petroleum reserves and the increasing instability of international crude oil prices [1,2]. The abundant reserves of natural gas in many parts of the world have made it attractive to commission new plants based on syngas chemistry. Syngas can be conveniently manufactured from natural gas, coal, and extra heavy oil at present and from biomass in the near future. Syngas chemistry is now considered as the main way of natural gas upgrading, and alcohol synthesis from syngas looks especially attractive. C1–C5 alcohols could be used as fuels, fuel additives for octane or cetane enhancement and oxygenate fuel additives for environmental reasons [3]. The higher molecular weight alcohols (C6–C9 and C10–C16) and their derivatives are used as intermediates of plasticizers, detergents and lubricants [4,5]. To the best of our knowledge, alcohols synthesized from syngas are mainly C1–C6, and few effective approaches to synthesize C6–C18 alcohols with high yields under a moderate process condition have been reported; therefore, direct synthesis of C6–C18 alcohols is attractive in both industry and academia. Co-based catalysts are suited to produce high yields of long chain paraffins in Fischer–Tropsch (FT) syntheses under mild conditions [6]. La2O3 has been discovered to be an excellent promoter in cobalt-based catalysts. Barrault and Guilleminot [7] observed a 100-fold increase in specific activity and TOF as a result of low levels of La addition to a Co/C catalyst and they attributed this promotional effect to the creation of new sites. However, Ledford et al. [8] reported there was little effect on the structure or CO hydrogenation activity for Co/Al2O3 catalysts with low levels of La promotion. Haddad et al. [9] found that La interacted with the Co metal on Co/SiO2 catalysts, resulting in the enhancement of reducibility of the cobalt oxide, while Adachi et al. [10] reported that La addition could promote the activity of Co/SiO2 catalysts by the agglomeration of cobalt. Up to now, the effect of La on Co-based catalysts is ambiguous and the previous reports focused on the FT reactions instead of alcohol synthesis. La-promoted Co/AC catalysts with high activity and selectivity of mixed linear C1–C18 α-alcohols from syngas were recently developed in our laboratory. The purpose of the present work is to study the promotional effects of La2O3 in the syntheses of mixed alcohols from syngas over Co-based catalysts."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Activated carbon (BET surface area 893m2/g and pore volume 0.57cm3/g, Beijing Guanghua Jingke Activated Carbon Co. Ltd.) was made from coconut shells. The material was crushed into 20–40 mesh and washed with de-ionized water before use. The activated carbon-supported Co catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method according to the following procedure: the activated carbon was vacuated for 30min and then impregnated in a rotary evaporator at room temperature with an aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.). After evaporating and drying in air at 363K for 8.0h, the sample was calcined at 623K for 3.0h in the argon atmosphere. The La-promoted catalysts were prepared by impregnating the activated carbon with mixtures of cobalt nitrate and lanthanum nitrate (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.), drying and calcinating under the same conditions as above. The un-promoted and La-promoted catalysts were denoted as 15Co/AC and 15Co–xLa/AC, respectively, where the loadings of Co and La were 15 and x wt.%, respectively in the dried catalysts (x =0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0)."
3,Catalytic test,"2.2 Catalytic test CO hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a stainless fixed-bed micro-reactor with an i.d. of 9mm. Prior to each reaction, the samples (4ml) were in situ reduced at 673K and 0.1MPa for 4h in a flow of H2 with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 1000h−1. After the samples were cooled to 373K, the syngas (H2/CO=2, GHSV=1500h−1) was fed into the catalyst bed and the temperature was increased at a 0.3K/min heating rate to 495K. During testing, the pressure of syngas was maintained at 3.0MPa. The reaction effluent passed through a gas–liquid separator in an ice-water bath to collect the liquid products. The moment when the reactor reached the desired temperature was taken as the starting time. The data were all taken after 48h of reaction, when a stationary activity had been reached. The outlet gases CO, H2, CH4, CO2 and C1–C5 hydrocarbons were on-line analyzed by an Agilent 3000A Micro GC with four packed columns of molecule sieve, Plot Q, Al2O3 and OV-1, and TCD as detectors. The liquid organic products and the aqueous products were off-line analyzed on a HP 6890 GC with 5% PH ME capillary columns, and FID as a detector after being carefully separated."
4,Characterization of catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of catalysts 2.3.1 XRD measurement Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) phase analysis was performed with a PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The XRD instrument was operated at 40kV and 40mA in a scanning angle (2θ) range of 5–75° at a speed of 14°/min. Three hundred milligrams of catalyst was placed inside a dish for XRD. The identification of the different phases was made using the JCPDS library. 2.3.2 Temperature-programmed reduction-mass spectroscopy (TPR-MS) TPR experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Autochem 2910 apparatus. The sample (60mg) was placed in a quartz reactor and reduced by a 10% H2–Ar gas mixture at a flow rate of 20ml/min with a temperature ramping of 10K/min. The hydrogen consumption was recorded with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) while some effluent was simultaneously traced with an Omnistar 300 quadrupole mass spectrometer for analysis. Quantitative calibration of the TPR-signal was carried out by a reference experiment on Ag2O. 2.3.3 CO adsorption The amounts of CO uptakes and Co dispersion were determined by pulsing carbon monoxide over the freshly reduced catalyst. The apparatus for pulse adsorption of CO was the same as that used in the TPR experiments. One hundred milligrams of catalyst sample was reduced in a flow of H2 at 673K for 1h, purged by He at the same temperature for half-an-hour, and then cooled down to 323K. Signals of CO were detected by TCD. The gas mixture of 5% CO–He was pulsed at 323K over the reduced catalyst until the TCD signal reached a constant value. 2.3.4 Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) TPSR experiments were carried out in the same apparatus as above. The sample (100mg) was reduced in a flow of H2 at 673K for 1h, then purged by He at the same temperature for half-an-hour, and finally cooled down to room temperature. CO adsorption was carried out at room temperature in flowing 5% CO–He gas mixture for 0.5h. After the catalyst was swept with He for 10min, 10% H2–Ar gas mixture in a flow rate of 20ml/min was passed through the catalyst bed and then the temperature was ramped at 10K/min to 600K. The mass spectrometer was used for detection."
5,Results and discussion,
6,The performance of CO hydrogenation,"3.1 The performance of CO hydrogenation Table 1 shows the results of CO hydrogenation over the 15Co–xLa/AC catalysts. Alcohols, hydrocarbons and CO2 were produced over the 15Co–xLa/AC catalysts under moderate reaction conditions (495K, 3.0MPa). It was interesting to find that most of the alcohols were linear α-alcohols that fell in the range of C1–C18. A significant difference in CO conversion was observed in the 15Co–xLa/AC samples. The CO conversion increased from 13.5% to 21.4% when La doping increased from 0% to 0.5%, but started to decline when La doping was higher than 1.0wt.%. Obviously, a small amount of La addition improved the catalytic activity, which is in agreement with the previous reports [7,10]. The doping of La into the Co/AC catalysts not only impacted on the CO conversion, but also resulted in changes of selectivity. The selectivity towards hydrocarbons was 69.2%, while the alcohol selectivity was only 22.2% over the 15Co/AC catalyst. The alcohol selectivity increased dramatically up to 33.5%, while that of hydrocarbons dropped down to 60.0%, and CO2 selectivity decreased slightly when 0.1wt.% of La was doped onto the 15Co/AC catalyst. When La doping increased to 0.5wt.%, the alcohol selectivity increased considerably to 38.9%, while the selectivity to hydrocarbons and CO2 dropped to 56.0% and 5.1%, respectively. It was found that, when La loading was further increased higher than 1.0%, the alcohol selectivity decreased slightly. Fortunately, it was still higher than that of the 15Co/AC catalyst. It was obvious that La could promote the formation of alcohols including methanol and high alcohols, but would inhibit the formation of hydrocarbon including methane. The 0.5% La doping Co-based catalyst showed the highest performance for mixed linear α-alcohol synthesis from syngas among all the 15Co–xLa/AC catalysts. It is worth noting that the proportion of methanol among alcohols was lower than 7.6% while that of C6–C18 α-alcohols was surprisingly as high as 34.1%. The alcohols as well as hydrocarbon products obtained over the 15Co–xLa/AC catalysts all obeyed Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) carbon number distributions. An example of such distributions is displayed in Fig. 1 for the 15Co–0.5La/AC catalyst. The carbon number distributions of linear α-C2–C18 alcohols and C3+ hydrocarbons were in good agreement with the ASF rule, although methanol, methane and C2 hydrocarbons deviated from the ASF distribution. Table 2 shows the chain growth probability factors (α) of hydrocarbons and alcohols as a function of La content. It was found that the hydrocarbons and alcohols had almost the same α value on the 15Co/AC catalyst, which indicated that they were derived from the same intermediates. It is interesting to find that hydrocarbons and alcohols had different α when La was doped onto the 15Co/AC catalysts. This result means that new active sites for alcohol formation appeared over the La-promoted 15Co/AC catalysts since they should have the same α if hydrocarbons and alcohols formed on the same species. The α values of alcohols were found to be decreased while those of hydrocarbons remained nearly constant (α=0.70±0.02) for the La-promoted 15Co/AC catalysts. On the basis of the above findings, we could speculate that there were two different types of active sites for the formation of alcohols over the La-doped 15Co/AC catalysts, whereas there was only one type of active site for the formation of alcohols on un-promoted cobalt catalysts."
7,Phase composition,"3.2 Phase composition Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the reduced 15Co/AC and 15Co–0.5La/AC catalysts. It was found that the cobalt species were mainly in Co3O4 phase (JCPDS No. 09-0418) on the calcined 15Co/AC sample. After the 15Co/AC and 15Co–0.5La/AC were reduced at 673K in H2 flow for 4h, weak diffraction peaks at 2θ of 44.3° were observed, which were ascribed to highly disperse face-centered cubic (fcc) metallic cobalt (JCPDS No. 01-1259). Similar diffraction peaks to those of the 15Co/AC and 15Co–0.5La/AC catalysts were also found on the other 15Co–xLa/AC catalysts. The XRD patterns of used catalysts shown in Fig. 2b were significantly different from those of the reduced catalysts. Besides diffraction peaks of metallic Co, some apparent peaks attributed to cobalt carbide (Co2C) species (JCPDS No. 72-1369, 2θ =37.0°, 41.3°, 42.5°, 45.7°, and 56.6°) and CoO (JCPDS No. 72-1474) were also detected over the used 15Co/AC and 15Co–xLa/AC catalysts, which indicated the formation of Co2C species during the reaction. The intensities of the diffraction peaks for Co2C species increased with the amount of La doping, implying that La favored the formation of Co2C species. On the other hand, no apparent peaks ascribed to La2O3 species can be found. Fan and Fujimoto reported that La(NO3)3 had been known to be converted to La2O3 by calcination at 723K, and the reduction to lower valence lanthanum oxide by hydrogen treatment at 673K was difficult [11]. Therefore, it is most probable that the La2O3 species were quite finely dispersed on the surface of the activated carbon carrier. On traditional Co-based catalysts, the major products are mainly hydrocarbons with only a small amount of oxygenates. The metallic cobalt (Co0) is the active site for dissociative adsorption of CO molecules, C–C chain growth and methane production. As we know, CO insertion into C n H m –M species before hydrogenation is required for CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols [3,12,13]. Based on the results of CO hydrogenation and XRD analysis, Co2C species were supposed to play an important role in CO insertion due to their noble-metal-like characteristics. It was postulated that CO was activated without rupture on the Co2C species, which inserted into C n H m –M bonds in a way that led to higher alcohol synthesis [14]. The CoO species was also reported to be active sites for CO insertion while metallic Co was the active site for CO dissociation which led to chain growth [3,13,15–17]. On the basis of the above observations, we can conclude that Co0 and Co2+ played a pivotal role in high alcohol formation during CO hydrogenation."
8,TPR analysis,"3.3 TPR analysis Fig. 3 gives the TPR profile of the un-promoted 15Co/AC catalyst and corresponding mass spectra (MS). The traces of masses (m/z) 2, 15, 18 and 28, which represent hydrogen, methane, water and carbon monoxide, were recorded with the increasing of temperature. There were three major peaks of hydrogen consumption at 471, 574K and a broad one between 600 and 950K (maximum at 758K) in the TPR profile of the 15Co/AC catalyst. The first peak was partly ascribed to the desorption of adsorbed water in the pore of Co/AC and the rest was due to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO, followed by the second peak which corresponds to the reduction of CoO to Co0 [18,19]. The broad hydrogen consumption peak at 758K might be assigned to hydrogenation of the surface oxygen-containing groups and the support in the presence of Co metal [20,21]. We believe it was mainly due to the hydrogenation of the surface oxygen-containing groups since H2O and CH4 were simultaneously formed, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Meanwhile, the MS signal of CO appeared above 720K. CO formation was due to the decomposition of surface oxygen-containing groups on the surface of activated carbon. TPR-MS profiles of La-promoted catalysts were similar to those obtained on the 15Co/AC catalyst. The signals of water and methane were detected over a temperature range similar to those of the 15Co/AC catalyst in all samples. There were some changes in the peaks of hydrogen consumption on the 15Co/AC samples with different La loading. Fig. 4 shows TPR profiles of the 15Co/AC with different La doping. The position of the reduction peaks of Co3O4 to CoO and CoO to Co shifted to higher temperature with increasing La doping, confirming that a strong interaction existed between Co nano-particles and La2O3 species. A shoulder peak at 620K was observed on the 15Co/AC catalysts with 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 La doping. This new peak might be ascribed to the reduction of cobalt oxides closely interacting with La2O3 promoter, which was difficult to be reduced. The reduction degrees of the 15Co–xLa/AC catalysts were calculated from TPR data and are presented in Table 3 . The 15Co/AC catalyst had a reduction level of 83%, and the degrees of reduction decreased with the increasing of La doping. The reduction degrees of 15Co–xLa/AC (x =0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0) catalysts were 75%, 73%, 71% and 62%. The TPR results indicated that the existence of La2O3 species inhibited the reduction of Co species. It was worth emphasizing that the increase of La doping led to a decrease of Co reduction degree along with an increase of the ratio of Co2+/Co0 in the 15Co–xLa/AC samples. It was found that La interacted with Co on Co/SiO2 catalysts [9], which was consistent with our findings. But they reported that La addition could enhance the reducibility of cobalt oxide, which was opposite to our observation. The differences might be attributed to the utilization of different supports. When SiO2 was used as a support, non-reducible Co silicate was formed due to the strong interaction between Co and SiO2, and the La–Co interaction could weaken the strong Co–support interaction, thus enhancing the reducibility of Co/SiO2 catalysts. In our work, the support was inert activated carbon and the Co–support interaction was weak, so the strong interaction between Co and La could lead to a decrease in the degree of reduction of 15Co–xLa/AC catalysts."
9,CO uptakes and Co dispersion,"3.4 CO uptakes and Co dispersion CO uptakes and Co dispersion of the reduced Co-based catalysts are presented in Table 3. The quantity of adsorbed CO first increased from 162.1 up to 175.7, then reached a maximum of 180.6μmol/g-cat when 0.5% La was doped on the 15Co/AC catalyst, and finally decreased if more La was continuously doped. The cobalt dispersion of the 15Co–0.5La/AC catalyst increased to 9.9% from 7.7% of the 15Co/AC catalyst. As we know, CO hydrogenation is favored by high metal dispersion and high reduction degree. The highest cobalt dispersion and moderate reduction degree on Co–0.5La/AC led to the highest activity among all these five catalysts."
10,TPSR results,"3.5 TPSR results Fig. 5 shows the influence of La doping on the methane TPSR spectra of adsorbed CO on the 15Co–xLa/AC catalysts. The CH4 peak temperature on TPSR spectra was reported to correspond closely to the catalytic activity of CO hydrogenation [22]. The methane peak shifted to lower temperature when La was doped into the 15Co/AC catalysts, which implied that the La-promoted catalysts have stronger ability to dissociate CO than 15Co/AC. It was found that the CH4 peak area first increased with La doping, then reached a maximum on the 15Co–0.5La/AC catalyst, and finally decreased rapidly when La was continuously increased. The intensity of CH4 peak was consistent with the CO adsorption quantity in CO-pulse adsorption. On the basis of above observations, we can conclude that the 15Co–0.5La/AC exhibited the highest hydrogenation activity of adsorbed CO, which was in good agreement with the CO hydrogenation results. The signals of ethanol and ethane were also observed during TPSR as shown in Fig. 6a and b. For 15Co/AC, the peaks of ethanol and ethane appeared simultaneously at 462K, which indicated that ethane and ethanol were formed on the same active sites. But for 15Co–0.5La/AC, the peaks of ethane and ethanol appeared simultaneously at 430K, along with another ethanol peak that was observed at 375K. We can conclude that alcohols and hydrocarbons could be derived from the same intermediate species on both 15Co/AC catalyst and 15Co–xLa/AC catalysts. Furthermore, the new ethanol peak clearly suggests the existence of new additional active sites for alcohol formation on the 15Co–xLa/AC catalysts. This conclusion can explain why the hydrocarbons and alcohols had different chain growth probability factors for La-promoted catalysts, as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2."
11,Conclusions,"Mixed linear α-alcohols of C1–C18 could be directly synthesized from syngas over 15Co–xLa/AC catalysts under mild conditions. The highest activity and alcohol selectivity were obtained over 0.5wt.% La doped 15Co/AC sample. It was found that a strong interaction existed between Co and La2O3. The existence of La2O3 decreased the reducibility of catalyst and promoted the formation of Co2C species. Small amounts of La doping improved the Co dispersion. This means that there were new additional active sites for producing alcohols on La-promoted catalysts. The highest activity and alcohol selectivity of the 15Co–0.5La/AC catalyst might be attributed to the high dispersion of Co and the appropriate ratio of Co2+/Co0, which are due to the interaction of Co and La2O3 and the formation of Co2C species."
