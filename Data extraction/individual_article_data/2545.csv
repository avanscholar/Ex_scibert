0,Introduction,"Limited crude oil reserves and competition with the food industry associated with fermentation-based biofuel production inspire new research efforts on effective catalytic transformations of alternative carbon sources to produce energy carriers and chemical feedstocks. Synthesis gas (CO+H2) can be derived from coal, natural gas, or renewable biomass and is a platform for the synthesis of fuels and chemicals. Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) of hydrocarbons has received growing attention as a source of low-sulfur diesel fuel because of the uncertainty of crude oil prices. However, higher alcohol (C2+ alcohols) synthesis from synthesis gas, as a source of chemical feedstocks, might be more commercially attractive. For example, Celanese Corporation reported an expected ethanol price of $1.4/gallon with their new coal-to-ethanol technology via acetic acid [1,2], and E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and BP have a stated goal for a butanol price of $1/gallon with their bio-based process currently under development [3]. Considering that methanol is currently produced from natural-gas-based syngas at the world scale, it is reasonable to expect a comparably low price for higher alcohols produced by a similar catalytic process, assuming production and selectivity achievements are realized. Because of methanol’s low solubility in gasoline, it needs to be further converted to another molecule such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) before being used as a gasoline blend. However, MTBE is being phased out as a fuel additive due to environmental concerns. Higher alcohols, on the other hand, have mutual solubility with gasoline and ethanol has been widely used in the US as a gasoline additive. Since almost all the ethanol used for fuel is produced from fermentation, there is still a need for a more efficient catalytic process for the production of ethanol (and other higher alcohols). An effective catalyst for the production of higher alcohols from syngas is necessarily multifunctional since CO activation, hydrogenation, carbon chain growth, and potentially alcohol coupling processes are all important steps in the reaction. Thus, no single-component transition metal catalyst has been discovered to effectively catalyze higher alcohol synthesis. Exploratory research on higher alcohol synthesis has discovered some promising candidates [4–8]. Rh-based catalysts are effective for the formation of ethanol and other C2-oxygenates from syngas [9–11], but the very high cost of Rh likely prohibits its large-scale utilization. Several non-precious metal catalysts for higher alcohol synthesis have thus been evaluated and include, for example, Cu–Co, Cu–Zn–Al and Zn–Cr–K [5], but improvements in the overall catalytic activity, alcohol selectivity, and long-term stability of these catalytic materials for higher alcohol synthesis are still needed. Molybdenum-based catalysts have been widely used in many hydro-treating processes because of their high activities in desulfurization and denitrogenation with H2. When promoted by alkali metals, Mo-based catalysts also show encouraging properties for higher alcohol synthesis from CO hydrogenation. Both supported and unsupported MoS2-based catalysts have been heavily investigated for higher alcohol synthesis [12–15] since it was firstly developed by The Dow Chemical Company in the 1980s [16–20]. However, trace amounts of H2S in the feed were required to sustain the performance of the MoS2-based catalysts [17]. Moreover, small amounts of sulfur may enter the carbon skeleton of the products, which is problematic as the world moves toward the use of very-low-sulfur fuels. Thus, there is a need for a non-sulfided alternative for MoS2-based catalyst in this process, among which molybdenum carbide has demonstrated some promise when properly promoted [21–25]. Early transition metal carbides are also recognized as potential substitutes to precious metal catalysts because of their similar surface electronic properties [26–28]. The selectivity toward alcohols over alkali-metal-promoted MoS2-based and Mo2C-based catalysts in the syngas reaction was reported to be low initially but increased significantly with time onstream over a period of several hours to several days [23,29–31]. Lee et al. suggested that the promotional effect of alkali metal species on MoS2 [13] and Mo2C [32] catalysts for alcohol formation during CO hydrogenation was mostly the result of the surface sites being blocked from adsorbing reactants. By using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), Koizumi et al. claimed that syngas adsorption on a MoS2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for CO hydrogenation was significantly suppressed by K species and the K-promoted Mo species were likely more oxidized than those on K-free MoS2 [33]. Muramatsu et al. also studied the role of a K promoter on a Mo oxide catalyst for alcohol production from syngas and concluded that K inhibits both dehydration of alcohols to alkenes and the hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes [34]. For supported MoS2-based catalysts, interactions between K promoters and Mo begins with the oxidized catalyst precursors [12,29,35,36] and that some K–Mo–S and/or K–Mo–S–O species are formed after sulfidation. However, it is still unclear whether the promoters enhance the activity of the catalysts for higher alcohol synthesis. Although CO adsorption has been used to probe the surfaces of MoS2-based [37–42] and Mo2C-based [43–47] catalysts, few of these studies addressed the promotional influence of the alkali metals on higher alcohol synthesis. X-ray absorption spectroscopy of Rb-promoted Mo2C/MgO catalysts demonstrated that the local environment around the Rb2CO3 promoter was structurally modified during reaction [23], but the actual structural form of the working promoter is not yet known. The present study uses diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed CO combined with density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the interactions between Rb and supported-Mo2C particles. Results from DRIFTS and DFT are used to interpret observed reactivity trends of working catalysts."
1,Methods,
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis Incorporation of Mo onto the alumina support (Mager Scientific, >99.98%, predominantly γ-phase, S BET =76m2 g−1) was accomplished by incipient wetness impregnation of an aqueous solution of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (99.98%, Aldrich) followed by drying in air for 12h at 400K and calcining in flowing air for 5h at 773K to produce a supported molybdenum oxide, denoted here as MoO3/Al2O3. Carburization of MoO3/Al2O3 was performed in a quartz tube by heating at a rate of 5Kmin−1 from room temperature to 573K and at a rate of 1Kmin−1 from 573K to 1033K in 20vol.% CH4 (GTS-Welco, 99.997%) and 80vol.% H2 (GTS-Welco, 99.999%) at a total gas flow rate of 75cm3 min−1 (STP). After ramping to 1033K in CH4/H2, the temperature was maintained at 1033K for 1h. The catalyst was subsequently cooled to 673K in flowing He (GTS-Welco, 99.999%, additionally purified by a Sigma–Aldrich OMI-2 purifier) and held at 673K for 5h in flowing purified H2 at a flow rate of 60cm3 (STP)min−1. The catalyst was then cooled to room temperature in flowing purified He before passivation in a 20cm3 min−1 (STP) stream of 1.04vol.% O2/N2 mixture (GTS-Welco) at room temperature for 12h. The alkali-metal-promoted Mo2C/Al2O3 samples were prepared by grinding Rb2CO3 (99.975%, Alfa Aesar) together with passivated Mo2C/Al2O3 in a mortar and pestle."
3,Hydrogenation of carbon monoxide,"2.2 Hydrogenation of carbon monoxide Hydrogenation of CO was conducted in a fixed-bed stainless steel reactor (BTRS Jr., Autoclave Engineers) with about 1.25g catalyst (0.025g nominal Mo2C). The catalysts were tested at nominally identical conditions of 573K, 30bar total pressure, syngas (H2 +CO) flow of 10cm3 min−1 (STP), and H2/CO=1. Additional experimental details can be found in our previous works [23,25]. In another series of studies on representative samples, water was introduced to the catalyst by flowing N2 (GTS-Welco, 99.999%, additionally purified by a Sigma–Aldrich OMI-2 purifier) to the fixed-bed reactor through a saturator with liquid water at 300K. The samples were sequentially treated at ambient pressure with 50cm3 min−1 (STP) H2O/N2 at 300K for 2h and with 50cm3 min−1 (STP) H2 (GTS-Welco, 99.999%) at 573K for 12h prior to syngas reaction. In control experiments without water, the samples were pretreated with 50cm3 min−1 (STP) H2 (GTS-Welco, 99.999%) at 573K for 12h prior to syngas reaction."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained on a Scintag XDS 2000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Scans were collected over a range of 2θ from 5° to 90° at a rate of 2°min−1 for bulk materials and 0.8°min−1 for supported catalysts. Elemental analyses of representative samples were performed by Galbraith Laboratories (Knoxville, TN). The loading of molybdenum and rubidium was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), and the loading of carbon was evaluated by combustion and coulometric measurements. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was performed on beam lines X23A2 and X18B at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory. The storage ring was typically operated at 2.8GeV with a ring current of about 300mA. The XAS data were obtained in the transmission mode at the Mo K edge (20keV) with a spot size of 0.5mm×5mm. The Mo K edge spectra were measured at room temperature with Mo foil (Goodfellow) as a reference. The air-free handling protocols for the non-passivated, unpromoted catalyst before reaction and the Rb-promoted catalyst after syngas reaction have been discussed in our previous work [25]. The XAS data were processed using the Athena [48] software for background removal, post-edge normalization, and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis. The value of E 0 was assigned here as the energy at the half-step height. Metallic Mo foil, MoO2 (99%, Aldrich) and MoO3 (99.99%, Aldrich) were used as standard references for Mo in various oxidation states. Standard bulk Mo2C (Alfa Aesar, 99.5%) was used to determine the amplitude reduction factors S 0 2 for Mo–C and Mo–Mo in the fitting of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The EXAFS results were fitted in R-space using two shells (Mo–C and Mo–Mo) generated theoretically using FEFF 6.0 [49]. The interatomic distances (r), coordination numbers (CN), Debye–Waller factors (Δσ 2), and energy shifts (ΔE 0) were derived from the fitting results in the Artemis software package [48]."
5,Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy,"2.4 Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy A Bio-Rad FTIR (FTS-60A) spectrometer outfitted with an MCT detector and an in situ reactor cell for DRIFTS (Harrick) was used for the CO adsorption studies. To obtain the spectra, 100 scans were co-added at resolution of 4cm−1. Samples of 2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 catalysts with Rb loading varying from 0 to 10wt.% were examined by DRIFTS according to the following procedure. A catalyst sample of 30mg was diluted in 90mg of KBr powder (Varian Inc.) before being loaded into the DRIFTS cell. The loaded cell was then purged with He (GTS-Welco, 99.999%, additionally purified by Sigma–Aldrich OMI-2) at a flow rate of 50cm3 min−1 (STP) at room temperature for 10min before being pressurized with equal flow rates of H2 (GTS-Welco, 99.999%, additionally purified by Alltech All-Pure) and purified CO (GTS-Welco, 99.997%) to 30bar. The purification system for CO was comprised of a CRS Model 1000 O2 trap, a homemade carbonyl trap (silica gel in a copper tube immersed in a dry ice/acetone cold bath), a homemade CO2 trap (Ascarite II CO2 absorbent in a copper tube), and a homemade moisture trap (Fluka molecular sieves 3Å loaded in a copper tube). Subsequently, the cell was heated to 573K at a rate of 10Kmin−1 and held at 573K for 12h in 30bar flowing syngas (H2/CO=1) with a total flow rate of 4cm3 min−1 (STP). The cell was depressurized after 12h treatment at reaction conditions and purged with 50cm3 min−1 (STP) H2 at 573K, ambient pressure, for an additional 1h before cooling to room temperature in flowing He. After recording a background spectrum of the sample, flowing He was replaced with purified CO flowing at a rate of 50cm3 min−1 for 15min. The sample was finally purged with flowing purified He at 50cm3 min−1 for 15min before recording a spectrum of adsorbed CO at 300K. In another series of studies on representative samples, water was introduced to the catalyst by flowing He to the DRIFTS cell through a saturator with liquid water at 300K. The samples were sequentially treated with the following conditions: 1bar H2O/He (50cm3 min−1, STP) at 300K for 2h and 1bar He (50cm3 min−1, STP) at 423K for 1h; 1bar H2 (50cm3 min−1, STP) at 573K for 12h; 30bar syngas (H2/CO=1, total flow rate at STP of 4cm3 min−1) for 12h and in 1bar H2 (50cm3 min−1, STP) for 1h; 1bar H2 (50cm3 min−1, STP) at 573K for 12h. After each step of the pretreatment sequence, the sample was cooled to 300K in flowing purified He (50cm3 min−1, STP). The background spectra were subsequently recorded at 300K in flowing He before introducing purified CO (50cm3 min−1, STP) for 15min. After purging with flowing purified He at 50cm3 min−1 for 15min, the IR spectra of adsorbed CO were recorded at 300K. In control experiments without water, the samples were pretreated with 50cm3 min−1 (STP) purified H2 at 573K for 12h and purged in purified He before introducing purified CO at 300K."
6,Computational methods,"2.5 Computational methods Plane-wave DFT calculations were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). We employed the revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (rPBE) generalized gradient functional [50,51] along with the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) [52,53] method to describe ionic cores. A plane-wave expansion with a cutoff of 400eV was used for all calculations. Geometries were relaxed using a conjugate-gradient algorithm until the forces on all unconstrained atoms were less than 0.03eV/Å. The surface structure of the molybdenum carbide catalyst modeled in this work is based on the reconstructed C-terminated hexagonal Mo2C(001) surface discussed in a previous study [54], which is illustrated in Fig. 1 . In that study, by comparing surface free energy and adsorption energy of alkali metal (K and Rb) atoms for different low-Miller-index surfaces of Mo2C, the Mo2C(001) surface was found to be one of the major surfaces in predicted Mo2C particles as well as to have the greatest affinity and dipole moment for Rb atoms. This surface is also known to favor a reconstruction in the absence of adsorbates [55–57], which results in both Mo-top and C-top sites for CO adsorption. Moreover, in spite of the potential support effect, the behavior of bulk Mo2C catalysts and Mo2C catalysts [21,22] and Mo2C catalysts on various supports (MgO [23], α-Al2O3 [25] and mixed-phase Al2O3 as illustrated in Section 3.3) is similar, which suggests that the actual sites on various Mo2C catalysts for CO hydrogenation would have a similar configuration. Given all the factors mentioned above, Mo2C(001) was chosen as a representative surface for modeling. A 6×6×1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh was used for (1×1) surface unit cell, which was sufficient to give well-converged results. For calculations on a (2×2) surface unit cell, the number of k-points in the Monkhorst–Pack meshes was reduced to 3×3×1. Geometries and energies for gas-phase species were calculated using supercells equivalent to those for the largest slab calculations. When examining adsorption, molecules were placed on only one side of the slab. Dipole corrections were therefore applied in computing all of the energies reported below [58,59]. The adsorption energy, E adsorption, of an atom or molecule was defined by E adsorption = E surface + E adsorbate - E total , where E total is the total energy of the system containing the adsorbed species, E surface is the total energy for the optimized bare surface, and E adsorbate is the total energy for the adsorbate in the gas phase. With this definition, positive-adsorption energies correspond to energetically favored states. Adsorbate coverages were defined by considering a surface with an adsorbed species on every surface molybdenum atom to have coverage of 1 monolayer (ML). This means that placing one adsorbate in a 1×1 unit cell gives coverage of 0.25ML. Vibrational frequency calculations were performed with the VASP package where the Hessian Matrix was calculated by finite difference approximation with step size of 0.03Å and only the adsorbate plus the surface atom to which it directly bonds were allowed to move. In order to compare with IR experiment, the calculated frequencies for the CO adsorbates are scaled by a factor of 1.009, which reflects the difference between the calculated (2124cm−1) and observed (2143cm−1) vibrational frequencies of gas phase CO."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy,"3.1 Characterization by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy The X-ray diffraction patterns of representative samples are provided in Fig. 2 . The alumina support (Fig. 2b) used for the catalysts has features of γ-Al2O3 (Fig. 2c) and α-Al2O3 (Fig. 2d). The 2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 2a) prepared at 1033K showed XRD peaks corresponding to the structure of the alumina support (Fig. 2b) without any clear evidence for crystalline Mo2C (Fig. 2e, the synthesis method can be found in previous work [23]). This result suggests that the Mo2C particles were well dispersed on the alumina support. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) at the Mo K edge of reference compounds and catalysts is summarized in Fig. 3 and Table 1 , with the shift in the edge position (determined at half-step height) defined as the increase in E 0 value from that of the Mo foil. The Fourier transforms (FT) of k 3-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) are shown in Fig. 4 and the structural parameters derived from the corresponding curve fits are presented in Table 2 . A representative curve fit is presented in Fig. 5 . Non-passivated 2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 (air-free) has a Mo–Mo coordination number of 2.8 (Table 2) and an E 0 shift of 2.4eV (Table 1), which is close to that of bulk Mo2C (1.8eV). Passivation significantly oxidized the supported carbide as demonstrated by the 5.2eV shift of E 0 and the reduced magnitude of the Mo–Mo peak in FT of the EXAFS (Fig. 4b). The value of E 0 of the passivated sample (5.2eV) was close to that of bulk MoO2. Elemental analysis of the passivated “Mo2C”/Al2O3 revealed 1.9wt.% Mo and a carbon-deficient stoichiometry of the supported molybdenum carbide, which is equivalent to MoC0.22. It should be noted that the carbon level of a “carburized” Al2O3 sample that was exposed to the same treatment as the catalyst synthesis, except that no molybdenum precursor was added, was subtracted from the analysis. The results from XANES, EXAFS, and elemental analysis indicate that partial oxidation of the freshly prepared molybdenum carbide occurred during the passivation of the catalyst. The oxidation of 2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 after passivation was more severe than the oxidation of 5wt.% Mo2C supported on MgO [23] or α-Al2O3 [25], perhaps because of the lower weight loading and very high dispersion of Mo. Evidently, there was a strong interaction between the Mo species and the Al2O3 support [60,61], which prevented agglomeration of the metal and may have formed a stable surface molybdate species on γ-Al2O3 [62]. Treatment of a passivated catalyst by reaction in syngas reduced the E 0 shift to 4.2eV and restored the Mo–Mo peak in the Fourier transform of Mo the EXAFS (Fig. 4c), giving a Mo–Mo coordination number of 2.1 (Table 2). Thus, molybdenum oxycarbide domains appear to exist under syngas reaction conditions, although we will continue to refer to the catalyst as supported Mo2C/Al2O3. The highly dispersed molybdenum oxycarbide has a longer Mo–C(O) distance and a shorter Mo–Mo distance than the corresponding values in bulk Mo2C (Table 2). Low Mo–Mo coordination numbers in very highly dispersed Mo2C clusters have also been reported on H-ZSM-5 zeolite [63], α-Al2O3 [25] and γ-Al2O3 [64], with Mo–Mo coordination numbers derived from EXAFS as low as 2.6, 2.5 and 4, respectively."
9,CO adsorption on Mo2C and Rb-promoted Mo2C,"3.2 CO adsorption on Mo2C and Rb-promoted Mo2C The formation of products during the syngas pretreatment (573K, 30bar syngas, H2/CO=1, 12h reaction in syngas) in the DRIFTS experiments was verified by monitoring the IR spectrum during reaction over a 5wt.% Rb–2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst, which is shown in Fig. 6 . The IR spectrum at reaction conditions was obtained after removal of a background that was recorded after the sample was purged at 573K for 1h in H2 at ambient pressure. The bands associated with CH4, CO2, H2O, CH3CH2OH and CH3OH, which appear at 3015, 2360, 1650, 1062 and 1030cm−1, respectively, were observed during reaction over 5wt.% Rb–2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 6). The IR spectrum of adsorbed CO on unpromoted 2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 at room temperature after being treated at 573K, in 30bar syngas (H2/CO=1) for 12h and in 1bar H2 for 1h, is shown in Fig. 7 . The spectrum of adsorbed CO on the unpromoted Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst, which was very low in intensity, revealed two bands at 2105 and 2014cm−1 and very small features at 2173cm−1 and 1946cm−1. A sample of “carburized” Al2O3 pretreated with the same condition showed no feature in the IR spectrum attributed to adsorbed CO. The corresponding vibrational frequencies derived from DFT calculations of CO adsorbed on a reconstructed hexagonal Mo2C(001) surface (Fig. 8 ) are shown in Table 3 . With a low CO coverage of 0.0625monolayer (ML), the vibrational frequency of adsorbed CO appears at 2121cm−1 and 1989cm−1 on C-top sites (Fig. 8b) and on Mo-top sites (Fig. 8c), respectively, with Mo-top sites providing a stronger binding energy (1.62eV) than C-top sites (1.55eV). High CO coverages typically cause a blue shift of the vibrational frequency of adsorbed CO [45,65], in part, a result of the dipole–dipole coupling of adsorbed CO molecules [66]. The DFT calculation results also show that on the unmodified Mo2C surface with CO coverage of 0.25monolayer (ML), the vibrational frequencies of adsorbed CO on both C-top sites and on Mo-top sites were shifted to higher frequency by 20cm−1. Similar shifts in the CO band were also observed on a W2C(0001) surface by Aizawa and Otani [67], who claimed the features belong to surface ketenylidene (CCO) species formed by adsorbed CO on carbidic carbon. Nevertheless, the assignment of bands associated with CO adsorbed on Mo2C is not straightforward, as discussed below. Aegerter et al. attributed a feature of 2178cm−1 to CO adsorption on coordinatively unsaturated Mo(IV) on a passivated Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalyst after activation in H2 [46]. Peri has also reported that CO adsorbed on Mo(IV) appears near 2190cm−1 [68]. Based on the these prior assignments, we attribute the minor peak at 2173cm−1 in Fig. 8 to CO adsorbed on oxidized molybdenum species or to the residual gaseous CO in the IR cell. The features in the range of 2071–2054cm−1 have been assigned to linearly adsorbed CO on a clean hexagonal Mo2C foil [45], on carbidic Mo sites present on Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalysts [43,44,46], and on modeled surfaces of hexagonal Mo2C described by DFT [69,70]. A shoulder CO band at 2125cm−1 has also been reported when Mo2C foil was pre-exposed to O2 [45]. Bands for linearly adsorbed CO (2015cm−1) and bridge-bonded CO (1850cm−1) were also seen by high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) on a Mo(110) single crystal with a surface carbide layer [71]. Consistent with the XANES of bulk Mo2C [23,25], the close-packed structure of Mo in Mo2C, and the similar electronegativity values of C (2.55) and Mo (2.16) [72], Mo in Mo2C should be close to the metallic state, so that adsorbed CO on metallic Mo would have similar vibrational frequencies to those on carbidic Mo. In fact, bands for linearly adsorbed CO on metallic Mo have been reported at 2055–2015cm−1 [68,73], whereas the features of bridged-bonded CO are in the range of 1975–1920cm−1 [73]. The asymmetric C–O stretching frequencies of ketenylidene (CCO) species varied from 2130 to 2100cm−1 depending on the groups that attached to the CCO structure [74]. Ketenylidene has been proven to be the most stable configuration of adsorbed CO on a C-terminated Mo2C surface by DFT [75]. Ketenylidene also formed when CO was adsorbed on a W2C surface that possessed a similar structure to Mo2C, giving C–O stretching frequencies varying from 1954cm−1 to 2041cm−1 with increasing CO coverage [67]. Interestingly, DFT calculations suggest that ketenylidene may be involved in the initiation of the carbon chain growth process in Fisher–Tropsch synthesis over iron carbide [76]. Müller et al. studied CO adsorption on a MoS2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, which demonstrates very similar catalytic behavior in CO hydrogenation to Mo2C, and reported a major IR feature at 2105cm−1 for CO on Mo2+ along the edge of the crystallites with a shoulder at 2060cm−1 attributed to CO on less coordinated corner sites [39]. Since the XANES of supported Mo2C catalysts (Table 1, Fig. 3b, and in Refs. [23,25]) suggest that the supported Mo2C catalysts are actually oxycarbides even after syngas reaction, the 2105cm−1 peak in Fig. 7 may result from CO on oxycarbidic Mo sites, and the secondary peak at 2014cm−1 could be attributed to CO on the Mo sites with lower valence. However, the difference between them may be also caused by different coordinative environments of Mo, such as corner vs. edge sites as described above for MoS2 catalysts. Moreover, it is possible that the 2105cm−1 peak is from the ketenylidene-like species with CO linearly adsorbed on C-top sites over the reconstructed hexagonal Mo2C(001) surface (Fig. 8), as suggested by the DFT calculation (Table 4 ). Fig. 9 summarizes the IR spectra of CO adsorbed on Mo2C/Al2O3, as the weight loading of Rb increased from 0 wt.% to 10 wt.%. Upon addition of promoter, the IR band of CO at 2105cm−1 diminished and the entire band associated with CO red-shifted according to the amount of Rb added. On a 10wt.% Rb–2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 9e), a very weak CO band appeared at 1900cm−1. A physical mixture of Rb2CO3 and “carburized” Al2O3 (ground with mortar and pestle) showed no feature of adsorbed CO after the same pretreatment conditions. In an effort to interpret the DRIFTS results, Rb and RbO were added to the reconstructed hexagonal Mo2C(001) surface previously described by DFT (Figs. 1 and 8) and vibrational frequencies of adsorbed CO on this promoted surface were calculated. Fig. 10 provides illustrations of Rb- and RbO-modified Mo2C surfaces, with and without added CO. The corresponding vibrational frequencies of adsorbed CO on the Rb-modified surfaces are listed in Table 4. At the identical CO coverage of 0.0625ML, the vibrational frequencies of adsorbed CO were observed to red-shift by about 34cm−1 on the C-top sites (Fig. 10b and e) and by 47cm−1 on the Mo-top sites (Fig. 10c and f) after the surface modification with either Rb or RbO. The calculated red shifts are in good agreement with the IR observations of CO adsorption on the Mo2C/Al2O3 catalysts with increasing Rb loading (Fig. 9b–e). It is also instructive to compare the binding energy of CO on the promoted and unpromoted surfaces. For instance, the binding energy of CO on C-top sites (1.53eV, Table 4) was almost unchanged from the unpromoted C-top sites (1.55eV, Table 3) at coverage of 0.0625 ML on the RbO-modified Mo2C surface. However, the binding energy of CO on the Mo-top sites increased by 0.1eV as a result of the added RbO, which might explain the decrease and eventual disappearance of the CO peak at about 2100cm−1 over the Rb-promoted Mo2C/Al2O3 (Fig. 9b–e). It is possible that the presence of the Rb species shifts the preferred binding from C-top to Mo-top. It should be noted that the calculations presented here are specific to one type of Mo2C surface, and that the size, composition, and morphology of the supported “Mo2C” nanoparticles are very different from the defect-free surface with long-range order used for modeling. Since the supported carbide samples investigated in this work were passivated in dilute O2 prior to reaction or DRIFTS investigation, the actual catalysts interrogated experimentally were likely to be oxycarbides rather than pure carbides. Indeed, the relatively high binding energy of CO on the simulated Mo2C surface is consistent with the high affinity of pristine carbides for simple adsorbates. Nevertheless, we used the DFT studies of a model carbide surface to explore the nature of the CO binding mode and the trend in the vibrational frequency of CO with alkali metal addition to that surface. Bugyi and Solymosi studied the interaction of CO with clean and K-covered Mo2C/Mo(100) surfaces by HREELS [77]. They found that CO adsorbed molecularly on the clean Mo2C/Mo(100) surface at 140K, giving an energy loss at 2100cm−1. Pre-adsorbed K atoms at intermediate coverages (0.5–0.8monolayer) at 140K led to an HREELS feature for CO at 1320−1375cm−1, attributed to a short-range interaction, while the development of features at 1670−1685 and 1860cm−1 was attributed to long-range interaction in the K–CO co-adsorbed layer [78,79]. They also suggested that K atoms were stabilized mainly by O atoms arising from the decomposition of CO. Indeed, given the high oxophilicity of both Mo2C and atomic Rb, neither bare Rb atoms nor oxygen-free Mo2C surface can likely exist in syngas reaction conditions. Comparing the observed vibrational frequencies of CO adsorbed on Rb-promoted Mo2C/Al2O3 at the surface science results for CO adsorbed on K-modified molybdenum carbide surfaces [77] at relatively low CO coverages, a similar trend is found in the shifts of peaks caused by the addition of alkali metal species. However, the shift in position is about −200cm−1 from Rb-free Mo2C/Al2O3 to 10wt.% Rb-promoted Mo2C/Al2O3, which is much less than the approximately −700cm−1 shift observed on a K-modified Mo2C/Mo(100) surface from a corresponding K-free surface [77]. This implies that the interaction of CO with cluster of molybdenum carbide was much less influenced by promoter compared to that of the extended surface in ultra-high vacuum. In summary, the shifts in CO band position in Fig. 9 may indicate a change of preferred binding site for CO molecules from C-top to Mo-top, as suggested by DFT calculations (Tables 4 and 5 ), or a coverage-dependent asymmetric C–O stretching frequency of CCO species formed on the carbide surface [67]. Additionally, the shift could also result from CO moving from a linearly adsorbed configuration to a bridge-bonded one [73]. The low-frequency tail of the CO band on unpromoted Mo2C/Al2O3 (Figs. 7 and 9a) extends to the region around 1900cm−1, which is the position of CO on the highly promoted Mo2C/Al2O3. Therefore, addition of the Rb promoter may simply deactivate the sites for CO adsorption at wavenumbers higher than 2000cm−1, leaving behind only sites with the lower characteristic frequencies. Unfortunately, at this point of time, a more definitive explanation of the observed shifts in the spectrum of adsorbed CO cannot be provided."
10,Reactivity of Mo2C/Al2O3 catalysts,"3.3 Reactivity of Mo2C/Al2O3 catalysts The performance of alumina-supported Mo2C catalysts in the reaction of syngas (H2/CO=1) at 573K and 30bar pressure is summarized in Table 5. Unpromoted 2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 functions primarily as an active Fischer–Tropsch catalyst producing mainly hydrocarbons (91% on a CO2-free basis) at 17% CO conversion. A significant amount of ethers was also observed over the unpromoted catalyst, but the amounts were substantially reduced at high loadings of the Rb promoter. The formation of ethers suggests that alcohols are primary products on unpromoted Mo2C catalysts, but they are further converted to ethers on the acid sites of the γ-Al2O3 portion of the support. This result is consistent with our previous observation concerning the intrinsic alcohol formation activity of unpromoted, non-passivated Mo2C/α-Al2O3, which is comparable to the rate of alcohol formation over a 1.5wt.% Rb–5wt.% Mo2C/α-Al2O3 [25]. The addition of 2, 5, 7.5 or 10wt.% Rb2CO3 to 2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 increased the selectivity to alcohols (12%, 50%, 62% or 67%, respectively) at the expense of overall CO conversion (down to 4.9% at the highest promoter loading), which is also consistent with our previous study on Rb-promoted Mo2C/MgO catalysts [23], and with prior works on potassium-promoted bulk Mo2C catalysts [21,22,80]. The alcohol production rate peaked at 0.25 g g Mo - 1 h - 1 when the Rb loading was 7.5wt.% and slightly decreased to 0.24 g g Mo - 1 h - 1 on a 10wt.% Rb–2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst. With the addition of Rb promoter, the shift of performance of the Mo2C/Al2O3 catalysts in CO hydrogenation from hydrocarbons to alcohols also correlates well to the red shift of the IR band of adsorbed CO (Fig. 9). It should be noted that in our previous studies of Mo2C supported on MgO [23] or α-Al2O3 [25], we did not report ethers in the product stream since they were present in very small amounts relative to those produced over Mo2C on alumina containing the γ-phase. No conversion of CO was observed over a mixture of Rb2CO3 and Al2O3 under typical reaction conditions, which proves that molybdenum is associated with the active site. Given that passivated carbides are also known to possess surface acid sites after exposure to dioxygen [81–86], one interaction between Rb2CO3 promoter and Mo2C/Al2O3 catalysts is to neutralize the acid sites on the carbide component and Al2O3 support, resulting in an increasing selectivity toward alcohols and decreasing selectivity toward hydrocarbons and ethers."
11,Influence of H2O on Rb-promoted Mo2C/Al2O3,"3.4 Influence of H2O on Rb-promoted Mo2C/Al2O3 Since the movement of Rb promoter across the catalyst surface is critical to achieve selective alcohol formation, we studied the role of water on activation of the catalyst. The IR spectra of adsorbed CO on 2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 (Fig. 11 ) and 7.5wt.% Rb–2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 (Fig. 12 ) catalysts were recorded after various pretreatment conditions. Water was introduced to the catalyst by flowing He to the DRIFTS cell through a saturator with liquid water at room temperature. Likewise, the rates of production of various molecules (hydrocarbons, ethers, alcohols, and total oxygenates) over 7.5wt.% Rb–2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 catalysts, with and without water pretreatment, are summarized in Fig. 13 . Despite the different pretreatment conditions (water or no water), the unpromoted Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst always had a major band for adsorbed CO between 2118cm−1 and 2102cm−1 and a secondary peak/shoulder at 2072−2025cm−1. The results suggest that, without promoter present, the influence of the water pretreatment was minimal and the catalyst will function primarily as a hydrocarbon formation catalyst, consistent with the known catalytic properties of unpromoted Mo2C in Table 3 and elsewhere [21–25,87]. With pretreatment in H2, the IR spectra of CO adsorbed on 7.5wt.% Rb–2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 (Fig. 12a) also revealed a major peak at 2105cm−1 and a secondary peak at 2030cm−1. According to the observed correlation between IR peak position of adsorbed CO in Fig. 9 and the product distribution reported in Table 3, this result would predict that hydrocarbons would be the initial products of CO hydrogenation over the H2-pretreated promoted Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst. In fact, the initial rates of production over H2-pretreated 7.5wt.% Rb–2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 13a) are 0.34 g g Mo - 1 h - 1 for hydrocarbons and 0.011 g g Mo - 1 h - 1 for alcohols, which are comparable to the corresponding productivities over the unpromoted Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst (Table 3). Therefore, pretreatment involving only H2 at reaction temperature does not efficiently disperse the Rb promoter across the catalyst. However, pretreatment with water vapor in flowing He at 300K for 2h before H2-treatment at 573K (Fig. 12c) completely removed the major IR peak of adsorbed CO on 7.5wt.% Rb–2wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 at 2105cm−1 and instead resulted in a band centered at 1965cm−1 (Fig. 12c), which suggests a strong interaction between the Rb promoter and the Mo2C catalyst. This peak position for adsorbed CO correlates well to the high alcohol productivity of the water-treated catalyst and very short induction period (Fig. 13b). The IR band of adsorbed CO remained unchanged after syngas reaction and further treatment in H2 at 573K. Since the peak for adsorbed CO above 2100cm−1 was not restored by additional treatment in H2, the interaction between the Rb promoter and the Mo2C catalysts that is facilitated by water is not reversible. These reactivity results coupled to IR spectroscopy clearly show how water plays a critical role in the distribution of the Rb promoter over the Mo2C clusters and presumably over the alumina support as well. Since H2O is a product of CO hydrogenation, the in situ formation of water likely facilitates distribution of Rb during the reaction and likely accounts for the induction time observed in Fig. 13a. The shift of peak position observed in the IR bands of adsorbed CO on Mo2C/Al2O3 with the addition of Rb promoter and the deviation of the CO feature on the unpromoted Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst in IR spectroscopy from that on freshly carburized Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 [43,44] confirm that Mo2C surfaces are modified by surface passivation, promoter impregnation, and syngas reaction. According to our DFT calculations, H2O can easily dissociate to form hydroxyl (OH) groups on the Mo2C surface with no energy barrier (Fig. 14 ), which is consistent with the findings by Tominaga and Nagai [69]. Additionally, Chia et al. used DFT to show that hydroxyl groups on molybdenum atoms associated with platinum clusters are acidic in nature [88]. Since interstitial carbide is known to modify the d band of molybdenum metal so that carbides exhibit some similar catalytic properties to platinum [27,89], strongly adsorbed hydroxyl groups on molybdenum associated with molybdenum carbide may also be fairly acidic. According to the correlation between the deprotonation energy of surface hydroxyl groups and the corresponding oxygen binding energy reported by Chia et al., a strong metal-oxygen bond weakens the O–H bond, which imparts strong acidity to the surface OH group [88]. In accordance with the DFT correlation by Chia et al., OH groups with deprotonation energies typical of strong acids have oxygen binding energies greater than 5eV. The calculated oxygen binding energy on the surface of Mo2C is −7.37eV, which suggests that a surface hydroxyl group on Mo2C will be strongly acidic. Thus, alkali metal promoters are needed to neutralize the acidic hydroxyl groups on passivated Mo2C catalysts."
12,Model of catalyst evolution,"3.5 Model of catalyst evolution A working model of the surface of Mo2C catalysts for CO hydrogenation is sketched in Fig. 15 . In the model, the carbide surface is firstly covered by oxygen atoms after surface passivation. Water in the ambient air and formed in situ during syngas reaction can dissociate on the carbide surface to form acidic hydroxyl groups, which are detrimental to alcohol selectivity. Addition of Rb2CO3 is needed to both neutralize surface acidity on Mo2C and Al2O3 and inhibit hydrocarbon formation on Mo2C. However, water that is added to the catalyst or generated in situ during CO hydrogenation is needed to distribute the Rb promoter across the catalyst surface. Exposure of the passivated catalysts to the syngas environment partially reduces the passivated carbide to create an active catalyst. The highly promoted catalyst has Rb on the carbide phase, which perturbed the adsorption mode of CO on the surface and shifted product selectivity from hydrocarbons to alcohols."
13,Conclusions,"An unpromoted sample of Mo2C/Al2O3 was active in the Fischer–Tropsch reaction and produced mostly hydrocarbons from syngas at 573K and 30bar. Moreover, the IR spectrum of CO adsorbed on the unpromoted carbide catalyst revealed features at 2105cm−1 and 2014cm−1. The addition of Rb promoter to Mo2C/Al2O3 gradually shifted the selectivity of the syngas reaction toward alcohols, primarily by inhibiting hydrocarbon and ether formation. The IR features of adsorbed CO on Mo2C nanoclusters shifted substantially to lower frequencies upon addition of Rb promoter (∼200cm−1 shift from an unpromoted sample to a 10wt.% Rb-promoted sample). Results from DFT qualitatively reproduced the trends observed by IR spectroscopy and were used to interpret the various features. The interaction of the Rb promoter and the Mo2C catalyst was facilitated by H2O added during catalyst pretreatment and presumably by in situ formation of H2O during syngas reaction. Results from reactivity studies, IR spectroscopy, and DFT were used to derive a model of catalyst evolution during synthesis, pretreatment, and reaction."
