0,Introduction,"As environmental pollution and energy shortage have become two major problems in front of the world, finding effective methods of combating these challenges is becoming imminent and noticeable [1–3]. Fortunately, photocatalysis technology holds a great potential to make a green and sustainable development path come true in modern chemistry [4,5]. Hence, an abundant of semiconductors-liked such as metal oxide [6], metal sulfide [7], organic polymer [8] and metal organic hybrid materials [9] have been investigated in the field of photocatalysis. In particular, as a traditional photocatalyst, TiO2 has shown powerful photocatalytic activity in several reactions in the past 30 years such as water splitting [10], photoreduction of CO2 [11], photodegradation of organic pollutants [12] and organic synthesis [13,14], it still receives a great attention nowadays. In recent years, TiO2 nanobelts or nanowires have received extensive attention due to their promising applications in solar cells, photocatalysis and lithium-ion batteries [15–19]. In comparison to other 0D or 2D materials, ribbon-like TiO2 nanobelts with smaller dimensionality have more distinct structural and functional advantages such as a large surface area, fast electron transport, effective charge transform and low recycling cost [17]. However, some intrinsic defects, especially wide optical bandgap (around 3.1 eV) and high recombination of photo-induced carriers, limited the photoactivity of TiO2 nanobelts. Fortunately, TiO2 nanobelts with very large surface area can be used as a platform to grow heterostructures with a series of diversified second materials to improve photocatalytic ability of bare TiO2 nanobelts [20]. Among numerous kinds of heterostructures, p-n junctions and Schottky junctions are the most popular and efficient approaches to prompt photo-electric conversion of photocatalysts. Yang et al. designed an ingenious Cu2O/TiO2 p-n heterojunction that shown excellent catalytic performance in photocatalytic degradation of p-nitrophenol [21]. Chen et al. used NiO to fabricate p-n heterostructures with TiO2 nanobelts by a sol-gel method [22]. Besides, metal nanoparticle/TiO2 nanobelts are a typical type of Schottky junctions, such as Au/TiO2 nanobelts [23], Pd/TiO2 nanobelts [24], Ag/TiO2 nanobelts [25], which have been synthesized successfully and exhibited obvious improvement in photocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, apart from the scarcity and expensive of the noble metal, these kinds of hybrid inorganic-inorganic materials still have some obvious deficiencies such as low surface area, poor visible light absorption capability, and slow transport rate of photo-introduced carriers. Hence, designing novel hybrid inorganic-organic materials might provide a new direction of efficient photocatalysis due to a huge number of organic photocatalysts like graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) [26], and other nitrogen containing organic polymers [27] exhibited excellent performance in several visible-light-induced organic reactions. To date, a diverse collection of triazole-, imine-, and hydrazine-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been emerged as a new generation of efficient photocatalysts due to their high chemical and thermal stability, numerous intrinsic catalytic active sites, regular and well-defined channel systems and excellent photoelectric conversion properties [28–32]. With the development of the exploration and research on COFs materials, plenty of researches have confirmed that the CN linkage (Schiff base) is versatile in constructing extended π-conjugated systems with almost eclipsed and ordered π-columnar structures [33–35]. Moreover, this Schiff base-based COFs materials show stronger optical absorption in the visible region and better structure stability in catalytic reaction system. It is the well stacked π arrays structure that endows COFs a high photo-induced carriers' mobility and a narrow optical bandgap matching a number of redox reactions [36–38]. Vyas et al. used reactions between cross-linker triphenylene aldehydes and difunctional hydrazine to prepare azine-linked COFs in order to apply in photocatalytic water splitting [39]. Schwab et al. successfully synthesized a series of three-dimensional conjugated poly(azomethine) networks for visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution [28]. Though a certain amount of achievements in photocatalysis have been obtained by using COFs as organic photocatalyst, its high combination rate of photo-induced carriers is still a severe limiting factor so that it still has great space for further development [40,41]. Recently, a novel hybrid core-shell MOF@COF was synthesized and shown robust photoactivity in photocatalytic degradation organic dye [27]. Sun et al. designed a Pd nanoparticles-doped TiATA@LZU-1, and found synergistic effect among components, namely “donor-mediator-acceptor”, which could enhance separation and transportation of photo-induced carriers [42]. However, for all us know, even though metal oxide/COF composite has been recently reported [43,44], metal oxide@COF hybrids used as photocatalysts have been rarely reported so far. Therefore, this intrigued us to research the potential of the covalent-connected core-shell TiO2 nanobelts@COF hybrid as a stable, robust and efficient photocatalyst. The interface between the π-conjugated COF and TiO2 is vital to improve photo-generated electrons and holes migration. In this work, we successfully prepared a range of TiO2 nanobelts@COF nanocomposites with different thicknesses of COF shell through a novel seed growth method [45], as shown in Scheme 1 . In detail, a low concentration of organic monomers was used to form seed particles on the surface of amino-functionalized TiO2 nanobelts, and then additional monomers could connect seed and construct hyperbranched and cross-linked poly(azomethine) structures through Schiff base reaction, namely synthesizing uniform COF shell on surface of TiO2 nanobelts. The as-synthesized hybrid materials exhibited obviously higher photoactivity than each pure material in the photooxidation of benzyl alcohol and there is no noticeable decrease after 5 cycling times. The possible mechanism for the excellent photocatalytic performance was also explored by experiments."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of TiO2 nanobelts and -NH2 functionalized TiO2 nanobelts,"2.1 Synthesis of TiO2 nanobelts and -NH2 functionalized TiO2 nanobelts H2Ti3O7 nanobelts were fabricated by a typical hydrothermal method according to previous report [15]. In brief, 0.4 g of P25 was dissolved in 80 mL of 10 M NaOH aqueous solution. After magnetic stirring for 1 h, the mixed solution was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 48 h. The resulting products were washed thoroughly with deionized water, and then treated by 0.1 M HCl and 0.02 M H2SO4 aqueous solution successively. The TiO2 nanobelts were obtained by annealing H2Ti3O7 nanobelts at 600 °C for 2 h. To functionalize the surface of TiO2 with amino groups, 0.6 g of TiO2 was immersed into 250 mL ethanol by sonication for 30 min to obtain homogeneous solution, followed by addition of 2.5 mL (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) quickly. After continuous stirring for 6 h under N2 protection, functionalized TiO2 nanobelts were rinsed with ethanol to remove the remaining APTES and then dried at 70 °C for 12 h."
3,Synthesis of TiO2@COF hybrid materials,"2.2 Synthesis of TiO2@COF hybrid materials To obtain a series of covalently integrated TiO2@COF hybrid materials, it needs two steps which are similar to Wang's methods [45]. Firstly, terephthaldehyde (PDA, 0.03 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL TiO2 suspension (40 mg mL− 1 in dioxane/mesitylene, 4:1 v/v) and kept stirring for 1 h until it became homogeneous. Afterwards, 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl) benzene (PAPB, 0.02 mmol) and 30 μL acetic acid were added under stirring, the heterogeneous seed nuclei was formed on the surface of TiO2 nanobelts subsequently. In the next step, to obtain highly crystalline TiO2@COF, PDA (0.06, 0.12, 0.18 or 0.24 mmol) and PAPB (0.04, 0.08, 0.12 or 0.16 mmol) with molar ratio of 3/2 were dissolved in above suspension together, followed by adding a certain of acetic acid (60, 120, 180 or 240 μL). Then the reaction mixture was sealed and heated at 120 °C for 72 h under stirring. After reaction, yellow precipitates were separated by centrifugation and washed with tetrahydrofuran (THF) and ethanol for several times, and subsequently dried at 120 °C under vacuum for 12 h. The resulting products were labeled as TiO2@COF-1, TiO2@COF-2, TiO2@COF-3 and TiO2@COF-4 respectively with the increasing PDA and PAPB amount. For comparison, pure COF was synthesized by similar synthetic process without the presence of TiO2. In detail, PDA (0.3 mmol) and PAPB (0.2 mmol) were dissolved into a dioxane/mesitylene solution (4:1 v/v, 5 mL) under stirring, followed by adding 300 μL acetic acid quickly. Then, the reaction mixture was sealed and heated for 72 h at 120 °C. After reaction, yellow precipitates were separated by centrifugation and washed with THF and ethanol for several times, and subsequently dried at 120 °C under vacuum for 12 h."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out on a M21X diffractometer with Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 1.514 Å) source. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were analyzed by a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. Solid state 13C NMR spectra were collected with a Bruker AVANCE III 400 M NMR spectrometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected using a ZEISS SUPRA 55. The details of the structure of samples were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were conducted on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model was used to measure the pore volumes and pore size distributions from the adsorption branches of isotherms. Inductively coupled plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP–OES) tests were performed on Agilent ICPOES 730. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-2550, and the reflectance standard was barium sulphate (BaSO4). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a nitrogen flow rate of 100 mL min− 1, from 40 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min− 1 using a STA 449F3 instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on a PerkinElmer PHI 5000. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), Mott-Schottky plot and photocurrent-time (I-T) profiles were measured by an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Shanghai, China) on a three-electrode system. In detail, Pt and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter electrode and reference electrode respectively, and Na2SO4 (0.2 M) was used as the electrolyte solution. The working electrode was prepared by dropping 200 μL suspension (2 mg catalyst was dispersed into 1 ml ethanol and 10 μl Nafion mixed solution) onto an ITO glass substrate (1 × 1 cm2) electrode surface and dried at room temperature. A 300 W Xe lamp (λ >400 nm) was used as the light source during the photocurrent-time (I-T) test. The EIS results were recorded over a frequency range of 0.01–105 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV at the same bias voltages. Electronspin resonance (ESR) signal of the radicals spin-trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-l-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was determined on a Bruker ESR A300 spectrometer. For detection of O2•- and phenoxyl radicals (+R-•CHOH•), photocatalyst is dispersed in acetonitrile which DMPO/benzyl alcohol solution (1:10, v/v) was added. The mixture was oscillated to obtain well-blending suspension."
5,Evaluation of photocatalytic activity,"2.4 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic benzyl alcohol oxidations were conducted in a 50 mL sealed reaction tube containing photocatalyst (20 mg), acetonitrile (3 mL) and aromatic alcohol (0.2 mmol). The reaction system was degassed and saturated with O2, then the irradiation, a white light LED lamp of 5.0 W power (λ = 420–780 nm, power density ≈ 150 mW/cm2), was carried out under stirring for 30 h. The reaction in the dark was conducted under the same conditions just without light. After the reaction, the solution, obtained by centrifugation, was analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrum (GC–MS, Agilent7890/5975C-GC/MSD) with HP5-MS column."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structure and morphology of TiO2@COF hybrid materials,"3.1 Structure and morphology of TiO2@COF hybrid materials The methods for preparing TiO2@COF hybrid materials have been studied at the beginning of experiments. In comparison with traditional methods, the seed growth method is easy to obtain dedicate ideal core-shell structure (Fig. S1) and relatively high crystallinity (Fig. S2) since the abundant COFs are prone to heterogeneously nucleate and grow on COF seeds/TiO2 surface. The corresponding photos of as-prepared photocatalysts indicate that the colors of the materials after coating COF on TiO2 changed from white to pale yellow and to deep yellow with the increasing amount of COF (Fig. S3). As shown in Fig. 1a, the characteristic peaks of COF mainly appear in the small angle region (0°-30°). The (100) plane of COF is the most obvious peak at 2θ = 2.88°. However, the other planes like (110), (200), (210) and (220), corresponding to peaks at 5°, 5.7°, 7.5° and 10°, are so inconspicuous that need to be observed by magnifying the small angle region, as shown in inset of the Fig. 1a [46]. As displayed in Fig. 1b, the XRD pattern of pure TiO2 not only show high levels of crystallinity, but also confirm the existence of a mixed phase of TiO2(B) and anatase [47], in which the peaks at 33.4° and 37.8° corresponded to (311) plane of TiO2(B) and (004) plane of anatase respectively. Besides, the broad peak at around 26° is supposed to be an overlap of (110) plane of TiO2(B) and (101) plane of anatase. Core-shell TiO2@COF hybrid materials exhibit diffraction patterns similar to pure TiO2 owing to the relatively weak intensity of COF, whereas the intensity of diffraction pattern peaks of TiO2 became weaker with increasing proportion of COF in hybrid materials. In addition, there were no significant changes occurred in TiO2 phases after integrating with COF indicating the skeleton structure and crystallinity of TiO2 maintained well. As shown in FT-IR spectra (Fig. 1c), TiO2 and COF exhibit similar characteristics to those in reported literatures. The absorption bands at 400–900 cm− 1 correspond to the stretching vibration of TiO and Ti-O-Ti [48]. It is noteworthy that the absorption bands ranging from 1750 cm− 1 to 750 cm− 1 become more obvious in line with the amount of COF (Fig. S4), among them a new peak in comparison to TiO2 appearing at nearly 1700 cm− 1 was an irrefutable evidence of presence of Schiff base [49]. Hence it could be concluded that series of TiO2@COF hybrid materials have been successfully synthesized. Besides, the FT-IR spectra of -NH2 functionalized TiO2 nanobelts was exhibited in Fig. S5, which confirmed the amino groups were existing on the surface of functionalized TiO2 nanobelts. The resonance of carbon atom of the imine bond in COF and the link is further determined by 13C NMR, the results of TiO2@COF-3 are shown in Fig. S6. The peak detected at 156.7 ppm confirms the formation of TiO2@COF hybrid materials. And the other characteristic signals of aromatic carbon atom are also analyzed in detail in Fig. S4. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was further used to quantity the content of TiO2 and COF in the hybrids and evaluate their thermal stability. As shown in Fig. 1d, pure TiO2 exhibited good thermal stability up to 800 °C with only a little weight loss and COF showed excellent thermal stability up to 500 °C under air atmosphere. On the whole, the structure collapse of TiO2@COF hybrid materials occurred at around 500 °C mainly because of the destruction of COF but with decreased residual weight at 800°C as COF/TiO2 ratio increased. According to residual mass of composites, the content of COF of hybrid materials could be quantified roughly, which are basically in agreement with the ICP tests, as shown in Table S1. The SEM images are shown in Fig. 2 , the majority of bare TiO2 nanobelts (Fig. 2a) exhibited smooth and clean surfaces and presented morphology with an average thickness of ca. 20–40 nm, width of ca. 40–150 nm, and length of ca. 0.2–10 um, and the morphology of pure COF (Fig. 2b) was nanosphere with a diameter of ca. 200–500 nm which was composed of layered-sheet according to TEM images (Fig. S7). After hybridization with COF, as expected, TiO2 still maintains its aforementioned morphology, whereas the surface of TiO2 in the TiO2@COF hybrid materials is uniformly coated with the vertically grown COF nanosheets and the thickness of shell of COF seed/TiO2 and TiO2@COF hybrid is ca. 2–50 nm (Fig. S8, Fig. S9 and Fig. 2d). Although the COF shell hardly exhibits any distinct lattice fringes, it makes little influence on the diffraction intensity of TiO2 core due to its relatively thin thickness. The HRTEM image of the heterostructures TiO2@COF-3 (Fig. 2e) displayed a fuzzy lattice fringes with the distance of 0.358 nm and 0.351 nm coinciding with (110) plane of TiO2(B) and (101) plane of anatase respectively. In addition, the porous structure of COF in TiO2@COF hybrid materials can be presented apparently according to the HRTEM image of TiO2@COF-3. The element mapping image reveals the well distribution of C, N, O and Ti elements in the TiO2@COF-3 (Fig. 2f). And the detailed results of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Fig. S10) show that the average content of Ti is about 37.72 wt%, respectively, which are comparable to the calculated value based on thermogravimetric analyses and ICP tests. The presence of Ti, O, C and N in TiO2@COF-3 was confirmed by the survey XPS spectra (Fig. 3a) and these results were in accordance with preceding EDS analysis. Then the high resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s, N 1s and Ti 2p were further analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3b, the C 1 s spectrum can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.5, 285.3, and 286.2 eV, corresponding to the sp2 CC bond of C atom in benzene ring, the C atom in CN linkage and CN respectively. The binding energy peaks at 398.9 and 400.2 eV appearing in N high resolution spectrum (Fig. 3c) could be assigned to pyridine-like and pyrrole-like N, respectively [50]. As to Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 3d), the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 characteristic peaks were found at 458.8 and 464.2 eV which were in agreement with previous published results for Ti4+ in titanium-oxo cluster [51]. According to Fig. S11a, it is obvious that the curve of the pure TiO2 shows type II isotherm and nanocomposites possess features of type I isotherm and type IV isotherm due to a slight desorption hysteresis between adsorption and desorption curves, which solidly prove the mesoporosity of the pure TiO2 and the coexistence of microporosity and mesoporosity of the TiO2@COF hybrids materials respectively. In addition, the BET surface area of pure TiO2 was 21.3 m2/g, and it increased from 193.6 m2/g for TiO2@COF-1 to 316.7 m2/g for TiO2@COF-4 hybrids materials with increasing the content of COF, but cannot exceed pure COF with 346.3 m2/g (the BET surface area of all samples is listed in Table S2). These results confirmed the combination of TiO2 and COF successfully again and increased surface area could adsorb more reactants and enhance the conversion rate sharply. Additionally, the pore size distributions shown in Fig. S11b indicated the existence of hierarchical pore structure, which also further confirmed the combination between TiO2 and COF."
8,Photophysical properties of TiO2@COF hybrid materials,"3.2 Photophysical properties of TiO2@COF hybrid materials As shown in Fig. 4a, pure TiO2 exhibits a much narrow optical absorbance with the edge at 360 nm due to its large band gap, while the optical adsorption edge of COF is determined to be 600 nm because of its higher level of conjugation of the aromatic system. After the combination of TiO2 and COF, the TiO2@COF hybrid materials inherit the optical feature of COF and show obviously more extended absorption band with the increasing ratio of COF to TiO2. The bandgap energy (Eg) values were estimated by the corresponding Tauc plots (Fig. 4b) through calculating the intercept of the tangents of (Ahv)2 vs. photon energy [52]. And the Eg values of TiO2, TiO2@COF-1, TiO2@COF-2, TiO2@COF-3, TiO2@COF-4 and COF are estimated to be 3.12 eV, 2.95 eV, 2.70 eV, 2.64 eV, 2.58 eV and 2.53 eV, respectively. Therefore, the integration with extended π-conjugated COF could reduce the bandgap and improve adsorption capability of visible light. In order to analyze the band gap details, XPS valence band spectrum (Fig. S12) and Mott-Schottky measurements (Fig. 5a) were used to estimate the valence band (VB) and conduct band (CB) positions respectively. The results of XPS valence band measurements indicated the VB position of TiO2, TiO2@COF-3 and COF is approximately 2.72, 2.09 and 1.61 eV respectively. As depicted in Fig. 5a, the flat band position (Vfb) of TiO2, TiO2@COF-3 and COF is approximately −0.54, −0.73 and −1.07 eV vs. the SCE, respectively, suggesting both TiO2 and COF are n-type semiconductor and TiO2@COF-3 is typical type II heterojunction. In addition, in consideration of the general case that the bottom of the CB in many n-type semiconductors is more negative by about 0.10 V than Vfb [53,54], the bandgap obtained by the XPS valence band spectrum and Mott-Schottky plots is basically in accord with previous results measured by UV–vis spectroscopy analyzation, which are listed in Table S3. It is well acknowledged that the length of lifetime of photo-generated electrons-holes pairs and the efficiency of charge transfer process are crucial to photocatalytic activity. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum (Fig. 5b) is an effective means to measure the charge carrier trapping and recombination in photocatalysts. With an excitation wavelength of 375 nm, the photoluminescence intensity of TiO2@COF-3 was dramatically quenched in comparison to pure TiO2 and COF, indicating the introduction of COF enhanced charge-separation efficiency indeed. The aforementioned conclusion was confirmed further by photocurrent transient response (Fig. 5c). To be specific, the order of photocurrent density was TiO2@COF-3 > COF > TiO2. And the slight decrease of photocurrent in the initial time could be explained according to previous reported literatures [55], that is to say there need establish an equilibrium between electrolyte solution and the photocatalyst layer at the beginning of irradiation. As to charge transfer process, the values of internal resistances of photocatalysts were measured by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement. As show in Fig. 5d, TiO2@COF-3 exhibits the smallest semicircular diameter of Nyquist curves, namely the smallest interfacial charge-transfer resistance, which is in line with the observed consequences of photocatalytic activity well. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared TiO2@COF photocatalysts was tested by selective photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol under visible light. All the samples were activated at 150 °C under vacuum for 12 h before the oxidation reaction. Prior to the examinations, a number of control experiments were conducted and the corresponding results suggested both irradiation and photocatalyst played an indispensable role in photocatalytic oxidation process (Entries 7 and 8, Table 1 ). The benzaldehyde-production performance of different TiO2@COF hybrid materials was exhibited in Table 1 clearly, and all photocatalysts showed superior products selectivity. There is no doubt that pure TiO2 (Entry 2, Table 1) showed a relatively low benzaldehyde yield due to its intrinsic low capability of responsiveness of visible light. It is noteworthy that COF exhibited an important influence on improving photocatalytic activity, even if itself (Entry 1, Table 1) just showed little catalytic activity which mainly attributed to its high combination rate of photo-induced carriers. Hence it is sensible to conclude that outer COF act like an appropriate light-harvest materials to absorb visible light and inner TiO2 serve as robust catalyst to oxide benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. In other words, it is the transportation of photo-induced electrons through the covalent connection between COF and TiO2 that prompts the separation of photo-induced carriers largely. In detail, the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol raised approximately linearly as the amount of COF in hybrids increased, and the TiO2@COF-3 (Entry 5, Table 1) showed the highest conversion (92.5%) which is approximately 10.1 times as that of TiO2 and 12.9 times as that of COF. However, a further increase in the content of COF resulted in a decrease in benzaldehyde yield which mainly attributed to thicker COF shell either extend the migration and diffusion length of reactants to inner catalytic sites, or reduce the efficiency of photo-induce electrons to TiO2 core. Then the plots of conversion versus reacted time (Fig. 6a) and their corresponding kinetic rate plots (Fig. 6b) were used to measure the catalytic performance furtherly. On the premise that photocatalysis oxidation of benzyl alcohol is a pseudo-first order reaction, the order of rate constants, TiO2@COF-3 (6.73 × 10− 2 h− 1) > TiO2@COF-2 (3.19 × 10− 2 h− 1) > TiO2@COF-4 (2.63 × 10− 2 h− 1) > TiO2@COF-1 (1.59 × 10− 2 h− 1) > TiO2 (3.35 × 10− 3 h− 1), which indicated the TiO2@COF-3 performs higher activity than other photocatalysts. In addition, to test the importance of covalent connection and synergistic effect for TiO2@COF-3, the mixture obtained by physically mixing of TiO2 and COF, with similar TiO2 content with TiO2@COF-3 based on ICP test results, was used to the oxidation of benzyl alcohol under the same conditions. As results shown (Entry 11, Table 1), the yield (15.9%) of mixture is much lower than that of TiO2@COF-3, which confirms both the covalent combination of TiO2 and COF and their synergistic effect could make a great contribution on improving the production efficiency of benzaldehyde. In the subsequent experiments, the oxidation of various aromatic alcohol was conducted by TiO2@COF-3 under the same reaction conditions to test the universality application of this photocatalyst. The results presented in Table 2 and showed the substrates with electron-donating groups (e.g., –CH3 and –OCH3) (Entries 2–3, Table 2) could be oxidized faster than ones with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -F and -NO2) (Entries 4–5, Table 2), which could be explained by that higher electron cloud density of the aromatic alcohol caused by introducing electron-donating groups, the easier to take the electron of alcohols away. In addition, the hydrogen atoms of secondary alcohol (Entries 6–7, Table 2) are more difficult to be removed to form carbon centered radicals, therefore very low conversion were found in oxidation of diphenylmethanol and ɑ-Methylbenzyl alcohol. In consideration of reusability and stability are essential to a relatively useful catalyst, it is necessary to investigate the reusability of catalyst, especially TiO2@COF-3. After each reaction, catalyst was collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol twice and dried in at 80 °C oven for 24 h. Impressively, TiO2@COF-3 shows high stability in 5 cycles maintained over 86.5% conversion of benzyl alcohol and 99.9% selectivity of benzaldehyde (Fig. 6c). The XRD patterns, FT-IR curves and TEM images of the photocatalyst (Fig. S13–15) after the 5 runs indicated its original morphology and crystal structure were maintained well and its satisfying stability endowed itself great potential in further practical applications."
9,The mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic activity for TiO2@COF hybrid materials,"3.3 The mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic activity for TiO2@COF hybrid materials In order to explore a plausible photocatalytic pathway to explain the scheme of catalytic process, some additional control experiments were conducted accordingly. There was hardly oxidation process occurred in the absence of O2 (Entry 9, Table 1) or using p-benzoquinone as super-oxide radical anion (·O2 −) detergent (Entry 10, Table 1), so it could be inferred that O2 – was derived from molecular oxygen by reacting with photocatalyst and it played a vital role in the process of aerobic oxidation reaction. Electron spin resonance (ESR) was also used to prove the presence of active radicals in the reaction system under simulated experiment conditions. As shown in Fig. S16a, the peaks for DMPO O2 •- species over the TiO2@COF-3 can be observed to be stronger than that over COF and TiO2 with the present of benzyl alcohol [56]. And the ESR signal of phenoxyl radicals (+R-•CHOH•) is also detected with result in Fig. S16b [56]. Accompanied by previous calculated the valance band (EVB) and conduction band (ECB) of TiO2 and COF, the possible efficient transport path of photo-induced carriers between TiO2 and COF was depicted in Fig. 6d. In the TiO2@COF hybrids materials, COF was more prone to absorb visible light and be excited to generate plenty of electrons in conduction band and holes in valance band respectively due to its intrinsic narrow bandgap. In the next stage, a lot of photo-introduced electrons in the conduction band of COF would tend to migrate to the conduction band of TiO2 whose energy is a little lower than COF. It is noteworthy to emphasis that the well-matched band structures of covalent-bond connection between TiO2 and COF makes a great influence on increasing transportation rate of photocarriers and decreasing recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, which could enhance the photocatalytic performance distinctly. And then, the photo-introduced holes could take electron from benzyl alcohol to form carbon centered radical and the electrons accumulated in the conduction band of TiO2 could activate O2 to generate ·O2 – respectively. Finally, the product benzaldehyde was obtained through the reaction between the benzyl methanol radicals and super-oxide radical."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, we designed and synthesized a range of covalent-connected TiO2@COF nanocomposites for photooxidation of alcohols. The introduction of appropriate content of COF realizes the modification of the intrinsic electronic properties, and enhances the visible light response of TiO2 nanobelts. The resulting TiO2@COF-3 showed the highest conversion (92.5%) which is approximately 10.1 times as that of TiO2 and 12.9 times as that of COF. Based on the total results of optical and electrochemical properties, we confirmed that the effective visible-light absorption of COF, well-matching band gaps between COF and TiO2 nanobelts, and less recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs across the covalent heterojunction interface in the hybrid materials are significantly contributing to the relatively high yield of benzaldehyde. This work offers a promising approach for designing high-efficiency organic-inorganic hybrid photocatalysts."
