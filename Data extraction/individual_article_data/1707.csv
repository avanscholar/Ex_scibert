0,Introduction,"Currently, 80% of global energy consumption is dependent on fossil fuels. Extensive fossil fuel consumption has led to atmospheric and environmental pollution. Consequently, global warming, the greenhouse effect, climate change, ozone layer depletion, and acid rain are affecting the environment [1]. To avoid the detrimental impact of environmental pollution, fossil fuels must be replaced with alternative, ecofriendly, and renewable energy sources. Recent studies have suggested that hydrogen is a cleaner and less expensive alternative fuel. As water is the only product of hydrogen burning, engines that use hydrogen as fuel are pollution-free [2]. Hydrogen is an abundant element in nature, but is found in combination with other elements, such as in water and organic compounds. At present, hydrogen production is based on nonrenewable sources, such as fossil fuels (~90% from methane and ~5% from other hydrocarbons) [3]. Therefore, the development of new and sustainable processes for adequate hydrogen production is needed. Recently, demand for the conversion of biomass-derived materials into useful chemicals has increased [4]. An interesting application of these materials is H2 production through chemical and photochemical transformations. Photocatalytic H2 production can be performed under mild conditions, and has been studied by several researchers using different biomass-derived chemicals, including alcohols, glycerol, glucose, and sugars. Recently, an increasing amount of glycerol has been produced as a byproduct of biodiesel production, making it a desirable material for this application. Solar photocatalytic reforming of biomass-derived glycerol offers a sustainable, renewable, and cost-effective method for hydrogen production [5–7]. TiO2 has been the most investigated photocatalyst due to its unique properties, including chemical and biological inertness, stability, and low cost [8]. However, due to its inherent relatively large band gap, TiO2 absorbs only UV light, which comprises only 5% of solar light. Therefore, much research has focused on lowering the threshold energy for TiO2 excitation to utilize visible light, which comprises a larger fraction of solar energy. Recently, we have prepared modified TiO2 that showed visible-light absorption and enhanced activity for pollutant degradation and hydrogen production through water splitting under solar light [9–15]. Furthermore, inhibiting electron–hole (e––h+) recombination is also important for improving activity. Indeed, the presence of metal particles or cocatalysts, such as Pt, Au, Pd, Rh, and Ag, on the TiO2 surface has been demonstrated to inhibit charge recombination [16,17]. As the Fermi levels of these metals are lower than that of TiO2, photoexcited electrons can be transferred from the conduction band to the metal/cocatalyst particles on the TiO2 surface, while photogenerated valence band holes remain on TiO2. This reduces the possibility of electron–hole recombination, resulting in efficient separation and more desired photocatalytic reactions. However, owing to the high cost and low availability of these noble metals, researchers are searching for new cocatalysts to improve photocatalytic activity [18–20]. Recently bismuth oxide modified photocatalyst have been reported for improved photocatalytic hydrogen production under solar light irradiation [21–23]. Recently, copper-oxide-doped semiconductor oxide catalysts have been reported to show improved activity in hydrogen production under visible or solar light irradiation [24–27]. Furthermore, bimetal-modified TiO2 catalysts have received increasing attention due to their exceptional performance in hydrogen production under solar light irradiation [28]. TiO2 modified with bimetal nanoparticles not only displays collective properties associated with the two different metals, but also shows new properties resulting from synergy between them. In these bimetal-modified photocatalysts, it is thought that one metal sensitizes TiO2, while the other acts as a cocatalyst, with this synergistic effect dramatically improving the activity [29]. Several bimetal-modified TiO2 photocatalysts have been reported to date, but Bi–Cu bimetal-modified TiO2 catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production have yet to be reported. Therefore, we turned our attention to synthesizing TiO2 modified with bismuth and copper oxide as a photocatalyst for solar photocatalytic H2 production by utilizing the sensitization effect of copper oxide and the cocatalytic abilities of bismuth oxide. As a result, absorption of TiO2 in the visible region was increased in addition to a decrease in e––h+ recombination. In the present study, we show that the new combination of bimetal oxides improves photocatalytic H2 evolution through sensitization and cocatalysis by copper and bismuth oxides, respectively."
1,Experimental,"All materials, catalyst preparation methods, characterization techniques, and procedures for photocatalysis experiments in the current study are provided in the Supporting information. Various bismuth modified TiO2 has been prepared and denoted as XBTO where “X” represents the wt% of Bi to TiO2. The copper and bismuth modified TiO2 was abbreviated as YCBTO where “Y” represents the Cu wt% to 2.0BTO."
2,Results and discussion,
3,X-ray diffraction (XRD),"3.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The crystal structures of bismuth oxide-modified TiO2 (BTO) samples were examined by XRD, with the diffractograms shown in Fig. 1a. All BTO and bare TiO2 samples comprised the anatase phase (major peaks at 25.26°. 37.8°, 47.9°, and 54.8°; JCPDF no. 71–1167). Increasing the bismuth oxide loading had no significant effect on the crystalline pattern of TiO2, but a reduction in peak intensity was observed. This might be due to bismuth oxide species on the surface of TiO2 restricting growth of anatase crystallites during synthesis. The anatase crystal peak positions were unchanged by bismuth oxide deposition, suggesting that bismuth did not replace titanium atoms in the crystal structure and remained on the TiO2 surface as bismuth oxide. This was supported by the atomic size of Bi3+ (0.096 nm) being much larger than that of Ti4+ (0.068 nm). BTO samples showed weak diffraction peaks related to bismuth oxide species, which might be due to the low bismuth oxide contents in the composite. However, TiO2 modified with 5 wt% Bi2O3 (denoted 5.0BTO) showed peaks (marked with * in Fig. 1a) at 27.9°, 30.9°, 32.7°, and 34.12°, corresponding to the (201), (002), (220), and (102) planes characteristic of the β-Bi2O3 phase [30]. This confirmed the successful formation of a TiO2/Bi2O3 nanocomposite. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of bismuth oxide and copper oxide-deposited TiO2 (CBTO) samples, which also showed characteristic peaks for anatase TiO2. Furthermore, peak reflections (marked with * Fig. 1b) at 29.6°, 37.4°, 43.6°, 61.8°, 73.4°, and 77.2°, attributed to the (110), (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes of crystalline cubic Cu2O, confirmed the presence of cuprous oxide in the CBTO nanocomposite. This result indicated that copper oxide and bismuth oxide nanoparticles were highly dispersed over the TiO2 surface in the CBTO samples, forming a Cu2O/TiO2/Bi2O3 ternary nanocomposite with a heterogeneous structure. This result was further validated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX), as discussed later."
4,UV–Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–Vis DRS),"3.2 UV–Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–Vis DRS) UV–Vis DRS spectra of the BTO samples are shown in Fig. 2a. Bare TiO2 showed a natural intense absorption band at around 380 nm in the UV region, with bismuth oxide deposition leading to increased absorption in the visible region accompanied by a color change from white to yellow. The absorption edge of BTO was expanded into visible region by a red shift compared with bare TiO2, which might be due to the interaction of bismuth oxide nanoparticles with the TiO2 surface decreasing the TiO2 band gap. The absorption curves of CBTO samples are shown in Fig. 2b. The CBTO samples exhibited optical properties in the visible region along with a prominent absorption in the 400–550-nm region and tail-end absorption between 550 and 800 nm. The absorption above 400 nm was due to the charge-transfer transition between the O2p and Cu3d states in Cu2O [31,32], while the broad absorption at 550–800 nm was due to the d–d electronic transition in the Cu2+ species of CuO. In CuO, Cu2+ has a 3d 9 electron configuration with a singly occupied d orbital, resulting in a d-d electronic transition that extends absorption up to 800 nm [33,34]. This peak was not observed for Cu+, which has a 3d10 electronic configuration with no single electron to undergo a d–d transition. Charge transfer between the O2p and Cu3d states in Cu2O is predominant in the CBTO samples. Tail-end absorption related to cupric oxide species might originate from aerial oxidation of the cuprous oxide nanoparticles. This confirmed that copper oxide species in the CBTO samples mainly existed as Cu2O [35]. The bandgap values of the bare TiO2, 2.0BTO and 2.0CBTO are calculated using the Tauc plots (Fig. S1) and are provided in the Table S1. The band gap of TiO2 was reduced with the Bi and Cu oxide modification. The band gap values of TiO2, 2.0BTO and 2.0CBTO are found to be 3.2, 2.84 and 2.4 eV respectively."
5,Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM),"3.3 Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) FESEM images of 2.0BTO and 2.0CBTO catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. Both samples had similar crystallites about 15–20 nm in size. The samples showed aggregated and interconnected nanocrystallites, which are beneficial for interparticle charge transfer. The samples show uniform particles and no secondary particles of bismuth or copper oxides are observed. This showed that bismuth and copper oxide nanoparticles were present as finely dispersed particles over the TiO2 surface rather than as separate particles. Finely dispersed bismuth and copper oxides were also observed in the HRTEM images of 2.0CBTO. This confirmed that the Cu2O/TiO2/Bi2O3 ternary nanocomposite was not a simple physical mixture, but had formed close heterojunctions between the Cu2O, TiO2, and Bi2O3 nanoparticles. To differentiate elements in the 2.0CBTO catalyst, elemental mapping was performed, with the results shown in Fig. 3e. Elemental mapping confirmed the presence of Bi and Cu in the 2.0CBTO catalysts. The uniform distribution of Bi and Cu spots in the mapping indicated the fine dispersion of Bi and Cu oxides on the TiO2 surface. Furthermore, EDX analysis of 2.0CBTO showed Bi and Cu contents of 2.07 and 2.12 wt%, respectively, which were close to the experimental values."
6,Transmission electron microscopy (TEM),"3.4 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) TEM images of bare TiO2, 2.0BTO, and 2.0CBTO samples are shown in Fig. 4. Bare TiO2, 2.0BTO, and 2.0CBTO showed crystallites with sizes in the range 15–20 nm. The 2.0CBTO catalyst showed some dark spots, which might be due to bismuth and copper oxide nanoparticles impregnated on the TiO2 surface (Fig. 4c). The presence of Bi2O3 and Cu2O species on the TiO2 surface was observed in the HRTEM image of 2.0CBTO (Fig. 4f) with distinguishable lattice spaces characteristic of the individual metal oxides present in 2.0CBTO. The HRTEM image showed multiple lattice spacings, including d-spacings of 0.367 nm, 0.347 nm, and 0.21 nm corresponding to the (101), (210), and (200) planes of TiO2, Bi2O3, and Cu2O, respectively. The inset of Fig. 4f shows diffraction rings corresponding to the polycrystalline nature of anatase TiO2 crystallites in 2.0CBTO. Fig. 4d and e show high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) and EDX analyses of 2.0CBTO, which further confirmed the presence of Bi and Cu species on the TiO2 surface. HRTEM results were in good agreement with the XRD results. Furthermore, the HRTEM images showed well-contacted interfaces among the TiO2, Bi2O3, and Cu2O phases. These closely contacted interfaces were anticipated to be beneficial for efficient charge transfer among the heterophases of semiconductor oxide photocatalysts."
7,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),"3.5 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) To determine the chemical states of elements in the 2.0CBTO nanocomposite, XPS spectra of Ti2p, O1s, Bi4f, and Cu2p were recorded, as shown in Fig. 5. XPS spectra of Ti showed two peaks at 460.2 and 466.0 eV, corresponding to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin-orbit couplings, respectively. These values confirmed that Ti primarily existed in the 4+ oxidation state in 2.0CBTO. The XPS of Bi in the 2.0CBTO composite showed two spin-orbit splittings at 160.8 and 166.0 eV, attributed to Bi4f7/2 and Bi4f5/2, respectively, which were higher than the values of the Bi3+ oxidation state in pure Bi2O3 [11,21]. The positive shifts toward higher binding energies indicated that bismuth oxide species in 2.0CBTO interacted strongly with the TiO2 surface. The increased binding energy might be due to the strong chemical bonding of bismuth with the TiO2 surface, resulting in the formation of Ti–O–Bi bonds over the TiO2 surface in the 2.0CBTO composite. As Bi atoms are bulky in size compared to Ti atoms, they cannot occupy the lattice sites of TiO2, instead existing as bismuth oxide on the external TiO2 surface. Therefore, bismuth oxide interacted with the TiO2 surface to form Ti–O–Bi bonds on the external TiO2 surface. The increase in binding energy was due to the electronic cloud being pulled toward Ti atoms and away from Bi atoms, which might create a charge imbalance around surface Ti atoms. This charge imbalance was compensated by the formation of oxygen vacancies over the TiO2 surface. To study these oxygen vacancies, the O1s spectrum of 2.0CBTO were recorded, which showed broad peaks ranging from 529 to 535 eV. The deconvoluted O1s spectrum exhibited binding energies corresponding to two oxygen chemical states, including crystal lattice oxygen (1 s(L)) and oxygen vacancy (1s(V)). This further confirmed the strong interaction of bismuth oxide species with the TiO2 surface that resulted in oxygen vacancies in the 2.0CBTO composite. The Cu2p XPS spectrum of 2.0CBTO was also recorded, as shown in Fig. 5. The 2.0CBTO sample showed two peaks with binding energies at 933.8 eV and 953.7 eV, corresponding to Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2, respectively. The 2.0CBTO sample showed no satellite peak, which confirmed the +1 oxidation state of copper in the 2.0CBTO composite. These results confirmed that Cu2O was the active Cu component in the 2.0CBTO catalyst. The XPS results confirmed the presence of Bi2O3 and Cu2O nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface, forming the ternary Cu2O/TiO2/Bi2O3 nanocomposite."
8,Photoluminescence (PL) spectra,"3.6 Photoluminescence (PL) spectra PL emission spectra can be used to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, immigration, and transfer, and to understand the fate of electron–hole pairs in semiconductors, as PL emissions result from recombination of free carriers either directly (band–band) or indirectly (via a band gap state). PL emission peaks were obtained within the visible range, with peak positions at 400–900 nm with 384-nm excitation. PL spectra of bare TiO2, 2.0BTO, and 2.0CBTO photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 6. For bare TiO2, intense signals were observed at around 520–650 nm and attributed to emissions from band gap transitions of anatase TiO2. Whereas the broad emission ranging from 500 to 650 nm is believed to be due to the excitonic signals originating from the oxygen vacancies in TiO2. The broad emission peak from 500 to 800 nm may be because of the color centers associated with the oxygen vacancies [36]. The PL emission spectra of the 2.0BTO can be considered mainly originating from the deep levels, such as the oxygen vacancies in TiO2 due to the surface modification with Bi2O3 nanoparticles. It should be noted that the bismuth oxide modification has reduced the emission intensities of the TiO2. It is already witnessed from the XPS spectra that the Bi modification has increased the number of oxygen vacancies in TiO2 which acts as a trap centers for the excited electrons. The PL spectra thus prove that the decreased electron/hole recombination in TiO2 is mainly because of oxygen vacancies formed due to surface modification with the Bi2O3 nanoparticles [37]. This trend is also observed for the 2.0CBTO sample which showed the lowest intensities for the PL emission peaks. Thus, after loading bismuth onto the TiO2 surface, the PL intensity of the emission bands was reduced due to fast photoinduced electron capture from the TiO2 conduction band by bismuth oxide, acting as a cocatalyst. Moreover, the weaker intensity of the emission bands indicated that most of the surface states were passivated, which made the electrons available for photocatalytic H2 evolution."
9,Photoelectrochemical (PEC) analysis,"3.7 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) analysis To compare the separation efficiency and transportation of the charge carriers, the photoelectrochemical behavior of bare TiO2 and 2.0CBTO nanocomposite (coated on ITO electrodes) were examined under simulated solar light irradiation using a potentiostat. Fig. 7a shows the photocurrent responses of bare TiO2 and 2.0CBTO in 60 s light on/off cycles. As anticipated, the 2.0CBTO nanocomposite showed better photocurrent density than that of bare TiO2, indicating good separation efficiency of the photoexcited charge carriers. Consequently, more electrons were available to reduce protons for hydrogen production. Furthermore, the photocurrent responses of the photocatalysts were reproducible for several on/off cycles and remained stable for up to 60 s of continuous irradiation, indicating that Cu and Bi supported on TiO2 efficiently inhibited photocorrosion. These observations were well supported by the PL results. Based on the above experimental evidence, we envisioned that Bi–Cu bimetal loading effectively enhanced the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to determine the charge transfer resistance. EIS Nyquist plots of bare TiO2 and 2.0CBTO photocatalysts at an open circuit potential of 0 V with Ag/AgCl reference electrode are shown in Fig. 7b. The reaction rate on the electrode surface was determined from the arc radius of the Nyquist plots. The 2.0CBTO catalyst possessed a smaller arc radius in the impedance plot than that of bare TiO2, which suggested that adding Bi and Cu onto TiO2 improved charge carrier separation. A smaller arc radius resulted in a lower charge transfer resistance and faster interfacial charge transfer reaction. Therefore, the smaller charge transfer resistance of 2.0CBTO favored a higher photocatalytic activity. It was also observed that the arc radius of the photocatalysts decreased in the presence of light. This further indicated that the 2.0CBTO catalyst possessed less resistance to the transfer of charge carriers in the presence of light, which is an important characteristic of semiconductors with improved photocatalytic efficiency. Charge carrier transfer studies based on PL analyses also showed fast carrier migration in 2.0CBTO without any recombination. These photoelectrochemical studies further supported that the separation and transportation of charge carriers occurred at a higher current density for TiO2 modified with Bi and Cu than for bare TiO2. Therefore, these properties of 2.0CBTO greatly influenced the H2 production rate under solar light irradiation."
10,Photocatalytic activity,"3.8 Photocatalytic activity Fig. 8a shows the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from 5% glycerol aqueous solution as a function of time for TiO2 with different bismuth oxide loadings. The photocatalytic activity increased with increasing bismuth oxide loading and tended to decrease with further loading. Among these catalysts, 2.0BTO showed the highest activity, with photocatalytic activity in the order 2.0BTO > 1.5BTO > 1.0BTO > 3.0BTO > 0.5BTO > 5.0BTO > bare TiO2. The highest hydrogen production of 1172 μmol/h was observed over 2.0BTO after irradiation for 5 h. This was about 11-fold higher than that of bare TiO2 (105 μmol/h). The enhanced photocatalytic activity of bismuth oxide-loaded TiO2 compared with bare TiO2 might be due to: (i) The surface impurity levels resulting from bismuth oxide loading increased visible absorption by decreasing the TiO2 bad gap, as evidenced by the UV–Vis DRS results [11]; or (ii) an increase in the lifetime of the charge carriers. The 4f level of the bismuth ion is known to trap photoexcited electrons, leading to an enhanced charge carrier lifetimes. The reduced activity at higher Bi loadings can be attributed to the increase in recombination centers for charge carriers [21,38]. Fig. 8b shows hydrogen production over various copper oxide-impregnated 2.0BTO catalysts. The highest hydrogen production of 3678 μmol/h was observed over 2.0CBTO (TiO2 modified with 2 wt% Cu and 2 wt% Bi), which was about three-fold higher than that of 2.0BTO (1172 μmol/h) and 35-fold higher than that of bare TiO2 (105 μmol/h). Hydrogen production from pure water splitting over the CBTO catalysts is shown in Fig. S2, with optimum hydrogen production observed over 2.5CBTO (85 μmol/h). The higher photocatalytic activities of the CBTO catalysts were due to the presence of cuprous oxide on the 2.0BTO surface, which acted as a sensitizer. Cu2O is known to effectively improve the visible absorption of TiO2. Under visible light irradiation, charge carriers are produced in Cu2O and transferred to the TiO2 conduction band. In contrast, Bi2O3 acts as a cocatalyst by trapping these electrons. Therefore, the lifetime of electron–hole pairs is increased and charge carriers are efficiently involved in redox reactions with adsorbed H+ ions for H2 evolution at the catalyst surface. Among these catalysts, 2.0CBTO exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity. The factors responsible for this enhanced activity were the improved optical absorption and increased lifetime of the charge carriers. Cu2O species increased the optical absorption properties of TiO2, while highly dispersed Bi2O3 on the TiO2 surface acted as a cocatalyst and contributed to the increase in charge-carrier lifetime. Therefore, the enhanced activity was attributed to the synergistic effect of increased optical absorption and improved charge carrier lifetime in the system. The conditions for photocatalytic hydrogen production over the 2.0CBTO catalyst have been optimized. The dependence of photocatalytic hydrogen generation on the glycerol content and catalyst content is shown in Fig. S3 and S4, respectively. To optimize the glycerol concentration, reactions were conducted with 2.0CBTO catalyst using glycerol–water mixtures with various glycerol amounts. The results are summarized in Fig. S3. Glycerol was involved in H2 production, and the glycerol concentration affected hydrogen production, with the photocatalytic hydrogen rate increasing with increasing initial glycerol concentration. The optimal glycerol concentration of 5% gave a photocatalytic hydrogen rate of 3730 μmol/h. Further increasing the glycerol concentration gave no increase in H2 production. This might be due to the photocatalyst surface reaching saturation at higher concentrations. The amount of catalyst in the reaction system also had a noticeable effect on the photocatalytic hydrogen rate, as shown in Fig. S4. Catalyst amounts of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 g/L 2.0CBTO in 5% glycerol–water solution were investigated for hydrogen production. With increasing catalyst amount, the hydrogen production increased and the rate of hydrogen production per gram of catalyst decreased. The highest hydrogen production rate of 6727 μmol/h was observed with a catalyst loading of 0.05 g/L. A higher catalyst content was disadvantageous for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. This might be due to higher amounts of catalyst making the solution turbid and, consequently, inhibiting the absorption of incident light by obstructing the light path that reached the catalyst particles. Furthermore, after several hours, the reactor volume became insufficient to accommodate the large amount of H2 generated from water splitting. Therefore, the partial pressure of H2 in the reactor increased, leading to increased H2 solubility in the solution, which would suppress H2 evolution reaction in solution to reduce H2 evolution [39]. To confirm this, the time-on-stream activity of the 2.0CBTO catalyst was measured, as shown in the Fig. 8c. The activity was found to increase linearly up to 5 h and then tended to increase slowly after reacting for 10 h. The decrease in hydrogen production rate over time might be attributed to increasing pressure from hydrogen produced during reaction. However, when the produced gases were evacuated and purged with N2 every 5 h, catalyst activity was retained and was stable for up to 25 h, as shown in the Fig. 8d. This confirmed that the catalyst was sustainable for longer periods, provided that evolved gases were removed or evacuated at regular intervals."
11,Structure activity correlation,"3.9 Structure activity correlation Based on the characterization data, the impregnation of bismuth and copper over TiO2 resulted in finely dispersed and highly interacted Bi2O3 and Cu2O species over the TiO2 surface. As the catalyst was exposed to sunlight, Cu2O absorbed visible light and produced e– and h+ in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. The electron was then injected into the conduction band of TiO2 and helped in absorption of visible photons from sunlight [35,40]. To obtain better activity, it is important that e––h+ recombination is minimal. The finely dispersed Bi2O3 species acted as e– receptors and helped minimize charge carrier recombination [41–43]. The photogenerated electrons were transferred from Cu2O–TiO2 to Bi2O3 species. The electrons accumulated in the Bi2O3 conduction band were transferred to H+ ions to produce H2. Meanwhile, holes in the valence band of Cu2O–TiO2 were consumed by the sacrificial agent, which further inhibited recombination. Therefore, cuprous oxide improved the visible absorption and bismuth oxide enhanced the charge carrier transport in the Cu2O/TiO2/Bi2O3 ternary nanocomposite. The photogenerated charge carrier recombination was suppressed and H2 production was enhanced. Possible photoexcitation and charge transfer processes that take place in the CBTO catalysts are shown in Scheme 1."
12,Conclusion,"The photocatalytic activities of Cu2O/TiO2/Bi2O3 ternary nanocomposite photocatalysts for hydrogen production from glycerol aqueous solutions and pure water splitting were investigated. The bismuth oxide deposition over the TiO2 surface has increased the oxygen defects which played crucial role in trapping the photoexcited electrons. Meanwhile, the cuprous oxide nanoparticles improved the visible absorption of TiO2. The ideal loadings of Bi and Cu was found to be 2 wt% respectively for the ternary Cu2O/TiO2/Bi2O3 nanocomposite. The catalysts produced up to 85 μmol/h H2 from pure water splitting and 3700 μmol/h from glycerol aqueous solutions. Under optimum reaction conditions, such as optimum glycerol concentration and catalysts amount, 6727 μmol/h H2 was produced, which is markedly high compared to that produced by bare TiO2 (105 μmol/h). Efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production by the Cu2O/TiO2/Bi2O3 ternary nanocomposite photocatalysts under solar light irradiation was mainly attributed to the synergetic effect of bismuth and copper oxides codeposition, wherein Cu2O extended the visible-light absorption of TiO2 and Bi2O3 cocatalyst minimized electron–hole recombination."
