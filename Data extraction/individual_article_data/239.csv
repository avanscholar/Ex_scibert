0,Introduction,"Vanadium oxides (VOx) are important class of metal oxides having different composition, structural diversity as well as crystallinity [1,2]. Because of such wide diversity, they have occupied a special domain in the field of energy sectors like lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors and in catalysis [3–5]. VOx with general formula VnO2n+1, n = 2–6 also represents varied oxidation state ranging from +3 to +5 [6]. Because of the presence of oxygen vacancy in VOx they are used in different catalytic oxidation processes [7–9]. VOx also possesses a suitable band gap approximately ∼2.6 eV, slightly less than that of titanium dioxide (TiO2∼3.2 eV) [10]. Due to such low band gap, VOx has been explored for different photocatalytic reactions [11–13]. However, VOx alone could not serve as an excellent photocatalyst like TiO2. TiO2 is well known to be an efficient photocatalyst in the UV range of the solar spectrum, [14,15]. TiO2 is already used in variety of reactions like photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) [16,17]. It is also modified by incorporating other metals like gold (Au), silver (Ag), iridium (Ir) and palladium nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance its photocatalytic activity [18–20]. Like the TiO2 when mixed metal vanadium oxides (VOx) are combined with other metal or co-catalyst, they also exhibited excellent photocatalytic behavior [21–24]. Bismuth vanadates (BiVO4) and silver vanadates (AgVOx) are two of the most widely studied metal-vanadates that are found to be excellent photocatalysts in transforming various reactions in the presence of UV or visible light [22,22,23,24]. Unsworth et al. [25] observed the good activity of nano-BiVO4 than the bulk BiVO4 material in photo-oxidation of BA. Jin et al. [26] synthesized the BiVO4 crystal for visible-light-driven BA oxidation. The activity of BiVO4 crystal got enhanced after modification with Pt and MoOx. Visible light assisted BA oxidation was also performed in presence of Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposites by Li et al. [27]. VOx supported on other metal oxides like TiO2, zinc oxide (ZnO) or silica (SiO2) or carbon matrix are also reported to serve as good photocatalysts for transforming different reactions [28–31]. Sannino et al. [28] performed selective oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde using VOx/TiO2 photocatalyst using UV-light. Channei et al. [29] synthesized mesoporous SiO2 coated with BiVO4 for visible light assisted photodegradation of methylene blue. Verma et al. [30] reported the activity of VO@g-C3N4 in the photocatalytic oxidation of BA in presence of H2O2 as an oxidizing agent. Benavente et al. [31] prepared different nanocomposites material of ZnO with V2O5 by changing the ratio of ZnO and VOx for photodegradation of dyes. Silver vanadates with different structural morphology and different band gaps are recently found to be an excellent photocatalyst for visible light assisted degradation of methylene blue [32]. In comparison to silver, gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) has some more beneficial points due to the large plasmonic effect and less toxicity. Due to this Au-NPs have been doped in different supports like TiO2, graphene’s for different photocatalytic reactions viz H2 production, dye degradation, reduction of nitrobenzene, oxidation of BA [33–35]. There are also sufficient numbers of reports on gold-vanadate clusters showing different catalytic activity [36–38]. For example, Li et al. reported for the activation of methane with Au-doped vanadium oxide (AuV2O6 +) [39]. Ding et al. studied the adsorption of single atom Au and Ag on vanadium oxide cluster [40]. Andreeva et al. studied the oxidation of benzene promoted by Au/V2O5 supported on titania (Au-V2O5/TiO2) and zirconia (Au-V2O5/ZrO2) [41]. Very recently, our group reported for the construction of gold sulfide (Au2S) using thioglycolic acid on VOx for water splitting reactions [42]. However, to the best of our knowledge the report on the photocatalytic oxidation of BA and 2-naphthol using ultrafine Au-NPs supported on mesoporous VOx is not well known in the literature. Both these two reactions were chosen because of the importance of both benzaldehyde and the BINOLs resulted from the oxidation of BA and 2-naphthols, respectively [43–46]. Benzaldehydes are one of the important fine chemicals required in pharmaceutical companies [43,44]. Similarly, the BINOLs are used as chiral auxiliaries for synthesis of many chiral compounds [45,46]. Therefore, if these products can be obtained at the expense of light energy then it will be an effective process from the green chemistry prospects. Looking into the importance of the two oxidation reactions and limited reports available in the literature on the applicability of gold-vanadates as photocatalyst, we herein report for new gold-vanadate catalysts and tried to illustrate their photocatalytic efficiency. In addition to this, the influence of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs) on the photocatalytic activity of Au-VOx was also studied [47,48]."

[49]. At first, the AuCl3 solution (1 × 10−3 M, 3 mg in 10 mL water) was reduced using NaBH4 as a reducing agent in presence of 0.5 mmol of lysine as a capping agent. This was further used as a stock solution in further synthesis of nanomaterials. 2.2.2 Synthesis of Au-NPs over vanadium oxide, (AuVOx) with cis-1,2cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid 2 mmol (0.34 g) cis-1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid was dissolved in ethanol and water mixture in presence of 4 mmol NaOH. After stirring the reaction mixture for 30 min, 2 mmol (0.314 g) of VCl3 dissolved in water was added and stirred the mixture for another 1 h. The reaction mixture was then subjected to autoclave for 24 h at 120 °C. After 24 h, 5 mL of gold solution (from the stock) was added as prepared from the reported procedure and the reaction mixture was further autoclaved at 120 °C for another 24 h. On cooling the autoclave, greenish-black precipitate (ppt) was obtained. The wet ppt. was then washed several times with hot water and then dried in an oven at 100 °C.

Vanadium chloride (VCl3) solution prepared by dissolving 1 mmol (0.157 g) in 5 mL of water and 2.5 mL of Au NP solution (from stock solution) was then added dropwise. The whole reaction mixture was stirred for another 30 min and then autoclaved at 120 °C for 24 h.

4,Application of nanocatalyst,"2.3 Application of nanocatalyst 2.3.1 Photo-catalytic oxidations of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde The oxidation of benzyl alcohol (OBA) to benzaldehyde was carried out in a photochemical reactor containing mercury lamp power 450 W as a light source. For performing the photocatalytic reaction, 4 mmol of BA was mixed with 30 mg of AuVOx catalyst [AuVOx-MWCNTs (20 mg) and V2O5 (30 mg)] in 20 mL of acetonitrile as the solvent. The mixture was subjected to photo-irradiation with light and stirred at room temperature. In the photochemical reaction, O2 gas was passed for 30 min to achieve oxygen saturation. 2.3.2 Photo-catalytic oxidation of 2-naphthol to BINOL The oxidation of 2-naphthol was also investigated using AuVOx or AuVOx-MWCNTs catalysts using H2O2 and molecular O2 as an oxidant under light at room temperature.

The reaction was studied by irradiating the reaction mixture for 60 min under a mercury lamp of 450 W. 2.3.3 Procedure for the degradation of methylene blue Methylene Blue (MB) dye degradation test was performed using a standard solution with a molar concentration of 2 × 10−5 M. The degradation of dye molecule was studied under light in the same photocatalytic reactor. The degradation reactions were monitored through UV–vis analysis. The photocatalytic dye degradation experiments were performed by taking 50 ml of MB in the presence of 20 mg of catalysts (AuVOx and AuVOx-MWCNTs). The reaction was initially stirred at room temperature in dark condition to achieve the adsorption-desorption equilibrium. It was then placed under photocatalytic reactor and monitored the progress of the reaction using UV–vis spectroscopy at an interval of 3 min."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the synthesized nanocatalyst,"3.1 Characterization of the synthesized nanocatalyst In this study, we considered three different materials viz V2O5, AuVOx, and AuVOx-MWCNTs. The three of these materials were characterized and analyzed using different techniques. The crystallinity of the material was ascertained from the XRD analysis and the presence of different VO vibrational band characteristics of vanadium oxides (VOx) was assigned from the FTIR analysis (Fig. 1 ). The XRD pattern shown in Fig. 1a (black) represented the highly crystalline and pure phase of V2O5. The XRD plane at 2θ values of 15.3 (020), 20.2 (001), 21.7 (011), 26.1 (110), 31 (040), 32.3 (101), 34.3 (130), 41.2 (002), 42.1 (012), 45.1 (141), 47.3 (060), and 48.8 (102) were due to V2O5 as shown in Fig. 1a, black line [50]. In the XRD pattern of AuVOx (red line, Fig. 1a), high intense peaks for Au-NPs were visible at the 2θ value 38.2, 44.5, 64.6 and 77.6 [51]. The particle size of Au-NPs was calculated using the Scherrer's equation and was found to be 34.14 nm with FWHM value was found to be 0.25 [52]. The additional peaks contributed from mixed valent VOx were observed at 2θ values of 26.9, 34.4, 35.5, 46.9, 52.5 and 56.5 and 61.1 (Fig. 1a, red line) [53,54]. The XRD pattern of AuVOx was found to be different from that of V2O5 and the different XRD pattern was due to the different crystalline phase of the material. The loss of some signals for VOx was attributed to the surface coverage by Au-NPs as well as amorphous nature of the material. The presence of weak characteristic signal for VOx and intense peak for Au-NPs confirmed for the formation of Au-NPs supported VOx material, Au-VOx. Similar to the AuVOx, the peaks were also observed in the carbon hybridized material. The high intense peaks at 2θ values of 25.6 for MWCNTs and the other peaks for Au-NPs and VOx are marked in Fig. 1a, blue line [48,51,53]. In the synthesized V2O5, the vibrational band at 1026 cm−1 and 830 cm−1 were for VO and VOV asymmetric vibrations. The bands at 610 and 477 cm−1 were characteristics of asymmetric and symmetric VO bond (Fig. 1b, black line) [55]. FTIR analysis of AuVOx suggested the presence of vanadium oxide in the synthesized material with the presence of vibrational at 987 and 896 for mixed valent VO bond of V4+ and V5+, respectively (Fig. 1b, red line) [56]. The CH vibrational band of CH2 unit appeared at 2922 and 2850 cm−1. The characteristic vibrational bands of VO2 were also observed at 857, 698 and 467 for VOV, VO and VO2 stretching vibration, respectively [32,57,58]. The presence of υas(COO-) and υs(COO-) vibration at 1615 and 1420 cm−1 was attributed to the presence of the carboxylate templating agent and their binding to the AuVOx surface stabilizing the Au-NPs. The FTIR spectra of AuVOx-MWCNTs are shown in Fig. 1b, blue line. In the FTIR pattern of AuVOx-MWCNTs, the vibration bands at 897 cm−1 were due to the VO and the band at 837, 751 and 526 cm−1 were due to stretching vibration of VOV, VO and VO2, respectively (Fig. 1b, blue line). These stretching vibrations were confirmed for the successful formation of the AuVOx material over MWCNTs [32,58,59]. The vibrational band for the coordination of carboxylic acid to the AuVOx surface was observed at 1631 cm−1. Raman analysis gives valuable information regarding the defect and disorder of the synthesized materials. From the ratio of intensities of D and G band (ID/IG) the presence of defects in the MWCNTs hybridized material can be identified. Higher is the value ID/IG ratio more is the defect in the system [60]. The ID/IG ratio in case of synthesized AuVOx-MWCNTs material was found to be 1.17 (Fig. S1, red line) while that in the pristine MWCNTs (Fig. S1, black line) was 0.68 less than the AuVOx-MWCNTs. Similar to our findings Wang et al. observed the reversal in intensity in the case of CNT@TiO2-C nanocable [61]. Srivastava and his coworker also reported the enhancement of the D band in the camphor supported MWCNTs in comparison with pristine MWCNTs [62]. The surface morphology of the AuVOx material was characterized by both SEM (Fig. 2 a–e) and TEM (Fig. 3 a–d). The morphology of the AuVOx represented a porous morphology with the high distribution of ultrafine Au-NPs. From the SEM images, the surface of AuVOx was clearly visible. The vanadium oxide particles were found to be larger in dimension with stone like morphology (Fig. 2a). The surface of VOx was found to be porous in nature as some pores were clearly observed in the SEM images of AuVOx (Fig. 2b). Similar porous nature was also reported by Chen and his coworker in V2O5 thin films [63]. The presence of small galaxy like particles over the porous surface was attributed to the distribution of galaxy like Au-NPs on VOx (Fig. 2c and d). Shen et al. also reported the ultrafine distribution of Au-NPs synthesized using hyaluronic acid [64]. The presence of all the elements over the selected area (Fig. 2e) was confirmed from EDX analysis shown in Fig. 2f. The mesoporous structure of VOx was also observed in TEM analysis (Fig. 3a). The small Au-NPs were found to be surrounded by porous VOx surface as can be seen from Fig. 3a. The high resolution TEM analysis further showed the oval like morphology of the Au-NPs within the size of 30−40 nm (Fig. 3b-d). The presence of both vanadium (V) and Au was also confirmed from EDX analysis. The EDX spectra and EDS mapping are depicted in Fig. 4 . The EDX analysis confirmed for high weight% of V in comparison to Au. The type-IV nature of the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm with the capillary condensation at p/p0 value of 4.2 clearly indicated the mesoporous nature of the material (Fig. 5 a). The BET surface area of AuVOx was 265.2 m2/g and from pore size distribution (PSD), the pore radius was in the range from 2−5 nm characteristic of mesoporous materials and pore volume were found to be 0.64 cc/g (Fig. 5b) [65]. The TEM analyses of AuVOx-MWCNTs also confirmed the presence of Au-NPs within the range of 20 nm and were found to be located at the outer surface of the MWCNTs (Fig. S2a–d). The surface area AuVOx-MWCNTs was found to be 151.8 m2/g and the pore radius and pore volume were 110.2 Å and 1.38 cc/g, respectively (Fig. S3). The lowering in the surface area of AuVOx-MWCNTs than the pristine COOH-MWCNTs (214.6 m2/g) [48] suggested for the successful deposition of AuVOx over COOH-MWCNTs. The TEM image of the synthesized V2O5 represented an oval-like morphology and the particles were of higher dimension >200 nm (Fig. S4a,b). The synthesized V2O5 was found to be EPR silent indicating that all the vanadium’s were in the +5-oxidation state. However, the appearance of eight intense EPR line for V4+ (I = 7/2) in AuVOx (red line) and AuVOx-MWCNTs (black line) indicated for the mixed-valence state of vanadium (Fig. 6 a) [66]. The AuVOx and AuVOx-MWCNTs were also characterized from XPS analysis. The presence of peaks at 517.6 and 516.2 eV for V3p3/2 and 524.1 eV for V3p1/2 indicated for the presence of both V(V) and V(IV) species of VOx unit in the AuVOx material (Fig. 6b) [67,68]. In the XPS spectrum, the peak at 517.6 eV was found to be more intense in comparison to the peak at 516.2 eV for V(V) species. This suggested that the VOx unit of AuVOx was rich with V(V) unit. The presence of other elements like Au, O, and C were also assigned from XPS analysis. The O1s spectrum of oxygen was mostly dominated by the oxygen atom of carboxylate moiety with binding energy values at 530.4, 531.7 and 533.5 eV for V-O, C = O, and C-O, respectively (Fig. 6b) [32,69]. The binding energy value of Au4f7/2 and Au4f5/2 were observed at 83.9 eV and 87.6 eV, respectively (Fig. 6c) [70,71]. These values were matching with those reported by Ganguly et al. [71] and suggested for the zero-valent oxidation state of Au. In the XPS spectrum for carbon, (C1s), the binding energy values were observed at 288.1 and 284.8 eV were for O-C = O and C-C unit of carboxylic acid, respectively (Fig. 6d) [72]. XPS spectra of AuVOx-MWCNTs are shown in Fig. S5. The presence of vanadium signals with binding energy values 517.5 and 515. eV for V3p3/2 and 523. eV for V3p1/2 state confirmed for the presence of V(IV) and V(V) species (Fig. S5a) [37,68]. The binding energy values of oxygen were observed at 531.2 eV and 532.4 eV for CO and CO of carboxylate unit, respectively. The formation of Au-NPs in the AuVOx-MWCNTs was confirmed from the presence of peaks with binding energy of 83.9 eV for Au4f7/2 and 87.1 eV for Au4f5/2, Fig. S5b [70,71]. In the C1s spectra, the binding energy for CO and CO bonded carbon was found at 284.8 and 286.4 eV, respectively (Fig. S5c) [72]. The cyclic voltammograms (CV) of AuVOx and AuVOx-MWCNTs were recorded in acetonitrile solvent using TBAB as a supporting electrolyte. The CV of AuVOx shown in Fig. 7 a represented an anodic peak at 1.67 V for Au(0)/Au(I) couple [73]. The reversible couple at 1.07 V was characteristics of VO2+/VO2 + and the quasi reversible couple with anodic potential at -0.71 V for V(IV) and cathodic signals at -1.08 V was for V(III)/V(IV) couples, respectively [32,74–76]. After hybridization with MWCNTs, the peaks potentials were shifted to a lower value as seen from the CV of AuVOx-MWCNTs recorded under the same environment (Fig. 7b). In the CV of AuVOx-MWCNTs, the cathodic peak at 0.87 V corresponds to V(IV)/V(V) couple while the sharp anodic signals at 0.79 V was for V(III)/V(IV) couple. The irreversible cathodic signal at -0.75 V was from V(IV)/V(V) couple of VOx (Fig. 7b) [32,74–76]. The shifting in the redox peaks observed in MWCNT hybridized catalyst was attributed to the conformational/configurational changes causing to the modification in the energy levels of conduction band and valence band of VOx unit. Another reason for shifting of peaks might be due to the presence of highly conducting nature of the MWCNTs that influenced the electron flow [77]. In the diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of V2O5, the four bands appeared at 243, 338, 392 and 489 nm (Fig. 7c, black line) [78]. The AuVOx material exhibited a board band which covered the whole range of the visible region. In the diffused reflectance spectra of AuVOx, the absorbance bands at 347 and 398 nm were assigned to a ligand to charge transfer transition from O→V(V) originated from VOx unit [42,79]. The broad band at 564 nm contributed from surface plasmonic resonance effect of the Au-NPs (Fig. 7c, red line). DRS of AuVOx-MWCNTs covers a long-range for which it was difficult to identify the exact peak values (Fig. 7c, blue line) [42]. The band gap the AuVOx (red line) and V2O5 (black line) materials was determined using the Tauc plot and were found to be 1.9 ± 0.05 eV and 2.1 eV, respectively (Fig. 7d) [32]. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the MWCNTs hybridized AuVOx (red line) was more stable than the unsupported AuVOx (black line), Fig. S6."
7,Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"3.2 Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol Vanadium metal-based catalysts are well known in BA oxidation using H2O2 or molecular oxygen (O2) [80–82]. But the reports on photo-oxidation of BA using VOX based catalysts are less available in the literature [30]. So, considering the limitations and usefulness of the reactions the synthesized AuVOx nanocatalyst was employed for the photocatalytic oxidation of BA to benzaldehyde using O2 as an internal oxidizing agent [83]. The oxidation reaction was performed in a photochemical reactor equipped with mercury lamp 450 W. The reaction was performed at room temperature and was controlled by circulating water around the external vessel of the reactor. The oxygen saturation was achieved by passing the air for 30 min. The oxidation of BA to benzaldehyde was performed using 4 mmol of BA in presence of 10 mg of catalyst in acetonitrile (CH3CN) as the solvent in the photochemical reactor. After irradiating for 40 min the reaction was quenched and the (%) conversion and (%) selectivity were calculated from GC analysis. The details of which is provided in supporting information. At this instant, the conversion was 57 % with 100 % selectivity. As the conversion was only 57 % so the reaction again monitored after different intervals of time like 60 min, 80 min, and 120 min. With increasing the time of the reaction, the conversion of BA to benzaldehyde was found to increase up to 75 % retaining the same selectivity. Further irradiation to 140 min causes the loss in selectivity. Hence, 120 min was assured as the optimum reaction time. As the amount of catalyst also influences the product selectivity and rate of conversion so the influence of catalyst amount was monitored by varying the amount of catalyst from 10 mg to 50 mg. The best conversion was obtained with 30 mg of the catalyst with 92 % conversion and 100 % selectivity (Table 1 ). To examine the effect of solvent, various solvents such as DCM, ethanol, DMF, chloroform were also used for the photocatalytic oxidation reaction using 30 mg of AuVOx and by irradiating for 120 min. The best result was obtained in CH3CN and thus 4 mmol of the substrate, 30 mg catalyst, and 120 min of reaction time in CH3CN was considered as an optimum condition in photo-oxidation of BA oxidation. Interestingly, when the same reaction was performed with AuVOx-MWCNTs, similar % conversion of 93 % and 100 % selectivity was achieved with only 20 mg of the catalyst (Table 1). More fascinatingly it required only 55 min to attain such conversion and selectivity. This truly signified that the MWCNTs promoted the photo-oxidation process at a faster rate as the MWCNTs are known to be good electron transporter. Further, the defect created sites in MWCNTs retards the recombination of the positive holes (h+) and electrons (e−) and thereby favored the photo-oxidation process [84,85]. The activity of AuVOx supported over MWCNTs was improved due to the presence of synergistic effect caused by the metal-support interactions [48]. Besides these, the supported catalyst was easy to recover from the reaction mixture without any loss in the catalytic activity and prevented the AuNPs from agglomeration. MWCNT also have high electrical conductivity and mechanical properties and favoured the photochemical reactions [84,85]. L. Palmisano and his co-workers have nicely illustrated different parameters that influence the photocatalytic activity of such hybrid heterogeneous photocatalysts [86]. The activity of the photocatalyst can be tuned by modifying the surface acid-base property, coupling of different semiconductors, addition of doping agents like nano-metals. Semiconductors with more positive potential usually favour the oxidation reaction. As VOx materials are reported to be in the positive range so probably they favoured the oxidation reaction [86]. The -COOH functionalized MWCNT modified the surface acidity and helped in adsorption of the substrate alcohol thus promoted the photo-oxidation process. The metal nanoparticles (NPs) in such hybrid system can serve as co-catalyst and acts as sink for generated electrons in the photocatalytic process [87]. Thereby they provide the selective site in the reaction and enhance the photo-oxidation process. These nanoparticles or co-catalyst such as Au-NPs can also help the photocatalytic reaction through LSPR [88]. As in our synthesized hybrid catalyst all these properties are combined together so we believe that presence of such characteristics features as mentioned by Palmisano has made AuVOx-MWCNT to serve as an efficient photocatalyst in light assisted BA-oxidation reaction. The synthesized V2O5 was comparatively ineffective for the considered photocatalytic oxidation reactions producing only 18 % conversion with 92 % selectivity (Table 1). The photocatalytic reaction of BA was performed using amorphous VOx catalyst synthesized without the Au-NPs and activity was found to be slightly higher than the V2O5 catalyst i.e. 25 % conversion and almost 98 % selectivity (Table 1). The amorphous nature of VOx was confirmed from XRD analysis and VO stretching frequencies were detected from FTIR (see supporting information, Fig S7). The result suggested that VOx with mixed phases performed better than the single phase. However, in both the cases the conversion was significantly lower than the Au-VOx and AuVOx-MWCNT. Hence, it was suggested that both the Au-NPs and MWCNTs were necessary to improve the photocatalytic ability of VOx. After obtaining the standard conditions with both the catalysts, the other substituted benzyl alcohols were also tested under optimized condition and the results are shown in Table 2 . It is pertinent to mention that the products obtained with other substituted substrates shown in Table 2 were not difficult to isolate through column chromatography hence are reported as isolated product yield."
8,Photocatalytic oxidation of 2-naphthol,"3.3 Photocatalytic oxidation of 2-naphthol Catalytic conversion of 2-naphthol to BINOL has been investigated by different researchers using different metal catalysts such as metal Schiff-base complex, metal salt, and metal oxides [70,89,71–95]. The most difficult part of this type of reaction is in achieving good yield and also to get the BINOL exclusively without the formation of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene and 1,2-naphthoquinone [70]. Significant success has been obtained with iron (II/III) catalyst either in homogeneous and heterogeneous form using O2 as the oxidant [96–99]. However, challenges still remain in selective conversion of the 2-naphthol to BINOL with nanocatalysts. Another challenge is in this type of reaction is the use of H2O2 as an oxidant. In presence of O2, the reaction takes a longer period of times so it is equally important to find a suitable catalyst that can impart high selectivity and can reduce the time of reaction [70]. The 30 % H2O2 is beneficial as it is considered as a green oxidant and also converts most of the reaction within a limited period [43]. However, this particular oxidant is considered to be ineffective in selective conversion of the 2-naphthol to BINOL. Therefore, looking at the challenge in this reaction, the 2-naphthol oxidation was performed using the synthesized material as a catalyst and the reaction was tested using O2 and H2O2 under light irradiation. From our study and various other literature reports, it was found that toluene serves as the best solvent for this kind of catalytic reaction [70,91,95]. Very recently, Kumar et al. [95] reported the 2-naphthol oxidation in toluene under visible light using O2. So, without further going for other solvents, the reaction was performed using 30 mg of the AuVOx and AuVOx-MWCNTs catalysts, and the reaction was run for 80 min using both O2 and H2O2 as oxidant in toluene. Initially, the oxidation of 2-naphthol was performed in the presence of O2 as an oxidant and was performed by saturating reaction mixture with O2 before irradiation. Under this condition, BINOL was selectively obtained without any other minor components. The % yield of BINOL with AuVOx and AuVOx-MWCNTs was found to be 42 % and 58 %, respectively. As in the previous reaction, the oxidation process was influenced by photo-irradiation time so the reaction was again performed by irradiating for 100 min, 120 min and 150 min. However, only a minimal increase up to 67 % was achieved with AuVOx-MWCNTs after 150 min. No further improvement was seen even after irradiating for 175 min (Table 3 ). However, as per the selective oxidation of 2-naphthol is concerned this amount of BINOL formation under such environmentally benign condition was considered as successive one. As reported by several researchers and from our study, it was observed that the oxidation of 2-naphthol in presence of O2 took higher reaction time in comparison to H2O2 [70,89–95]. The challenge lies in the selective formation of BINOL in presence of H2O2 as an oxidant as it leads to the formation of other byproducts. Therefore, our main objective was the selective conversion of BINOL from 2-naphthol in presence H2O2 [70]. The selective oxidation of 2-naphthol to BINOL was not successful with AuVOx as the BINOL formation was accompanied by the other two compounds namely 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene and 1,2-naphthoquinone in presence of H2O2. Fortunately, AuVOx-MWCNTs resulted in the selective formation of BINOL without any other minor component. BINOL was obtained up to 65 % yield when it was irradiated for 50 min and the yield was improved to 78 % after irradiation for 60 min. The results of 2-naphthol oxidation are depicted in Table 3. It is pertinent to mention herein that the oxidation of 2-naphthol to BINOL under aerobic condition is available with various other catalysts, few of the reported results are provided in Table 4 for comparison. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a limited literature is available on the oxidation of 2-naphthol to BINOL using H2O2 as oxidant [70,100]. The time consumed for this important catalytic oxidative CC coupling reaction hence been found to be extremely short in comparison to those under non-photocatalytic and aerobic condition [89–94]. Therefore, the AuVOx-MWCNTs could be a beneficial catalyst for oxidative coupling of 2-naphthol. We also performed a blank reaction in absence of H2O2 and the catalyst but the reaction did not proceed at all under light. In presence of H2O2 under irradiation of light no BINOL was formed only the 1,2-naphthoquinone was detected. This implied that selective formation of BINOL was dependent on the presence of the catalyst. The reaction did not proceed under dark condition in presence H2O2 and the catalyst suggesting for a light assisted photo-oxidation reaction."
9,Tests for photocatalytic ability of AuVOx and AuVOx-MWCNTs,"3.4 Tests for photocatalytic ability of AuVOx and AuVOx-MWCNTs In general photocatalytic activity of a material is also accessed by understanding their ability to degrade the colour dye molecules [32,48]. Therefore, to further confirm the photocatalytic ability of the synthesized material methylene blue (MB) was considered as the test compound. As the V2O5 and VOx was not efficient in the photocatalytic oxidation reactions so for dye degradation test AuVOx and AuVOx-MWCNTs catalysts were considered. To do this, initially, a standard solution of MB (2 × 10−5 M) was prepared in 500 ml distilled water from which 50 mL of MB was taken in 100 mL beaker followed by the addition of 5 mg of catalyst. The reaction was kept in dark for 1 h before the photocatalytic reaction. After 1 h the whole reaction mixture was placed under the photocatalytic reactor. The photocatalytic reaction was monitored in UV–vis spectroscopy by collecting the samples in an interval of 3 min (Fig. 8 a–d). In the presence of 5 mg of AuVOx, the absorbance value of the characteristic peak of MB at 663 nm decreased with increasing time. Complete colour bleaching of MB was observed within 24 min of reaction as shown in Fig. 8a. The amount of the catalyst also played an important role in the degradation of organic pollutants. The catalyst amount was varied from 5 mg to 20 mg, in presence of 10 mg catalyst; MB colour disappeared within 15 min while the same occurred within 12 and 9 min in the presence 15 and 20 mg catalyst in a similar reaction condition (Fig. 8b to d). The amount of catalyst was further increased up to 25 mg but the results were not improved. Therefore, 20 mg of catalyst was sufficient enough to degrade the MB dye within 10 min. The catalytic degradation was also performed in the presence of AuVOx-CNT. However, it required only 10 mg of the catalyst to completely bleach the dye molecule within 7 min of reaction time."
10,Mechanism of the photochemical oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"3.5 Mechanism of the photochemical oxidation of benzyl alcohol In order to find out a suitable mechanism for the photocatalytic activity of AuVOx or AuVOx-MWCNTs we performed an EPR analysis. To do this we considered AuVOx as a test catalyst and recorded the EPR spectrum of the material via UV light irradiation (Fig. 9 a). It was found that on UV light irradiation the EPR lines show hyperfine splitting due to the coupling of nuclear of vanadium (I = 7/2) with the unpaired electron spin (I = 1/2) for V4+ (3d1) [101]. This implied that probably under the presence of light there was a creation of more V4+ sites which in presence of oxygen got oxidized to V5+ providing the reduced oxygen species (O2-.) which are known to be active species for photocatalytic oxidation process [102]. The presence of a sharp signal with g value 2.02 was a clear indication for the presence of oxygen vacant site in the material after photo-irradiation. The Au-NPs helped in retarding the recombination rate of the photogenerated electron and hole, e− and h+, respectively [86,87]. Photoluminescence (PL) emission is an important technique to know the rate of the e− and h+ recombination during the photocatalytic reaction. The intensity of PL spectra directly related to the probabilities of recombination i.e. higher the intensity of photocatalyst higher is the chance of recombination [103]. The intensity of PL spectra for AuVOx-MWCNTs (Fig. 9b, black line) was measured to be less than the AuVOx (Fig. 9b, red line) and V2O5 (Fig. 9b, blue line). The high intensity associated with V2O5 clearly signified its ineffectiveness in the photo-oxidation process. The results of the PL emission study were in agreement with our catalytic study with AuVOx-MWCNTs and AuVOx. Further, the photocatalytic oxidation may proceed via the generation of different reactive species such as electron (e−), hole (h+), ˙OH radical and superoxide (O2 −) [104,105]. Therefore, to understand the involvement of the active species responsible for photochemical oxidation of BA to benzaldehydes different trapping experiments using various scavenging agents were performed. Ammonium oxalate and p-benzoquinone were used scavenging agents for holes (h+) and O2 ˉ˙. AgNO3 and tert-butanol were employed as scavengers for electron and ˙OH radical [104,105]. On addition of silver nitrate to the reaction mixture under standard conditions, the conversion of product formation drastically decreased. The other scavenging also decreased the conversion of the reaction except for tert-butanol which suggested that reaction did not proceed via ˙OH radical. These results indicate that the conversion of BA to benzaldehyde mainly took place through the formation of O2 ―⋅ species in the reaction mixture [104,105]."
11,Recyclability of the catalyst,"3.6 Recyclability of the catalyst The recycle ability of a catalyst signifies the capacity of a catalyst to reuse for the maximum number of cycles. As per the industrial application of a catalyst is concern it is reasonably good to find out a catalyst with high recyclability. Therefore, to see the recyclability of the catalyst we considered AuVOx as our test catalyst and the photocatalytic oxidation of BA as the standard reaction. After performing the first cycle, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture through filtration using Whatman filter paper. The solid material after the collection was again used for the catalytic oxidation of BA. The activity of the catalyst was found to retain up to 3rd cycle and thereafter the catalytic activity decreased dramatically. In order to understand such loss in the catalytic activity, we performed SEM (Fig. 10 a–c) and the EDX analysis (Fig. 10d) on the recycled catalyst after 3rd run. From the SEM analysis, it was found that Au-NPs got agglomerated into much larger Au clusters leading to a decrease in catalytic activity."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, it can be said that the AuVOx and its hybridized form can selectively catalyze the oxidation of both benzyl alcohol and 2-naphthol under photo-irradiation. The hybridization of the metal-vanadate with MWCNT greatly influenced the physical and chemical properties of the materials. This in turn resulted in the improved the photo catalytic ability of AuVOx catalyst. The AuVOx modified with MWCNT was found to be highly selective particularly in the photo-oxidation of 2-naphthol to BINOL. The report on the oxidation of 2-naphthol using light and H2O2 as an oxidant is very much limited in the literature. The present work can therefore provide an alternative approach towards the synthesis of BINOL from 2-naphthol."
