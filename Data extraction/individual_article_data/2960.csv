0,Introduction,"Hydrogen gas has been attracting much attention as a clean and renewable energy carrier. Biological hydrogen production would be one of the promising ways because of its environmentally acceptable characteristics [1]. Among fermentative hydrogen producers, obligate and facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium [2], Enterobacter [3–5] and Escherichia [6] convert glucose to hydrogen gas at a high rate, but their yields of hydrogen gas are limited due to co-production of organic materials such as carboxylic acids and alcohols. Miyake et al. [7] constituted the co-culture of an obligate anaerobe, Clostridium butyricum, and a photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodobacter sphaeroides RV, to achieve a high yield of 7mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose, where organic acids produced by C. butyricum were converted to hydrogen by the photosynthetic process of RV. Clostridium strains, however, are difficult to cultivate due to their oxygen sensitivity. Yokoi et al. [8] carried out co-culture of Clostridium and Enterobacter in which the latter might protect the former against oxygen by respiration. We also have been trying to constitute co-culture systems by using facultative anaerobes because of greater ease of culture as compared with the obligate anaerobes. We tested hydrogen-producing Enterobacter or Escherichia as a co-culture partner with Rb.sphaeroides RV, but the efficiency of conversion from glucose to hydrogen gas (in molar ratio) was as low as 3 to 4 (the results will be reported elsewhere). Here, we choose a lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus delbrueckii. The bacterium is not a hydrogen producer by itself, but lactic acid is a suitable substrate for hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria. There have been a few reports on the use of lactic acid bacteria for hydrogen production. Ike et al. [9,10] demonstrated efficient hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria with lactic acid which are starch-hydrolyzing lactic acid bacteria produced with starch accumulated in green algal cells. Our final goal is the treatment of molasses accompanied with energy production. Here, we report about the optimization of co-immobilization and operating conditions for Rb.sphaeroides RV and Lb.delbrueckii NBRC13953 to maximize hydrogen production with glucose as a model compound."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacterial strains and cultivation,"2.1 Bacterial strains and cultivation Lb. delbrueckii NBRC13953 was obtained from the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation, Biological Resource Center. Rb. sphaeroides RV [7] was isolated and preserved by the National Institute of Advanced International Science and Technology. All the culture and hydrogen production experiments were done at 30 ∘ C . The illumination with halogen lamps for culture including the photosynthetic bacteria was approximately 0.19 mEinstein / m 2 / s on the surface of culture bottles. The cell concentration of the bacteria was shown in OD (optical density) as measured by Spectro 20 + spectrophotometer (Bausch & Lomb (provided by Taitech, Tokyo, Japan)) at 600nm. The unit ODs of Lb.delbrueckii NBRC13953 and Rb.sphaeroides RV were equivalent to 0.71 and 0.39mg dry weight per ml, respectively. The cell dry weight was determined after filtering some amount of bacterial suspension on a nitrocellulose membrane filter ( 0.22 μ m in pore size) and drying overnight at 95 ∘ C . For use in the co-immobilization, Lb.delbrueckii was grown in screw-capped tubes filled with PGY medium without agitation for 2 to 3 days until the OD came to 3 to 4. PGY medium (1000ml) contained 10g each of peptone, glucose, yeast extract and CH3CO2Na, and 1g each of MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O and NaCl, and 0.1g of MnSO4. pH was adjusted to 7.0. The culture conditions for Rb.sphaeroides RV were according to Miyake et al. [7] except the increased (10 times) phosphate concentration used in the following basal medium. For the co-immobilization, RV was grown with aSy medium (see below) in 560ml Roux bottles for 3 to 4 days until the OD exceeded 3. The basal medium (1000ml) contained 8660mg of KH2PO4, 7330mg of K2HPO4, 200mg of MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , 73mg of CaCl2, 20mg of Na2EDTA, 11.8mg of FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , 2.8mg of H3BO4, 2.1mg of MnSO4, 730 μ g of Na 2 MoO 4 · 2 H 2 O , 240 μ g of Zn 2 SO 4 · 2 H 2 O , 40 μ g of Cu ( NO 3 ) 2 · 3 H 2 O , and 0.15 μ g each of biotin, p-aminobenzoate, nicotinate and nicotinamide. aSy medium contained 1.25g of (NH4)2SO4, 9.8g of disodium succinate and 1g of yeast extract in 1000ml basal medium, pH being adjusted to 6.8. gL medium contained 6.76g of D , L -lactic acid and 0.333g of monosodium glutamate in 1000ml basal medium. gG medium contained 4.5g of glucose and 1.87g of monosodium glutamate in 1000ml basal medium. pH of gL and gG was adjusted to 6.8. gL and gG media were sterilized by filtration, but aSy and PGY media were processed by conventional autoclaving. The yeast extract, peptone and agar used were Bacto (Difco)."
3,"Co-immobilization, pre-culture and hydrogen production","2.2 Co-immobilization, pre-culture and hydrogen production The co-immobilization was carried out according to Miyake et al. [7]. Lb.delbrueckii and Rb.sphaeroides RV were grown as described above and harvested by centrifugation and suspended in the basal medium. The two kinds of bacterial suspensions were blended, and the volume was adjusted to 15ml. The obtained blend was then mixed with 15ml of 4% agar in the basal medium kept at 80 ∘ C and poured into a 200ml Roux bottle (tissue culture bottle-like) to make a gel (Fig. 1 A). The Roux bottle had a working volume of approximately 212ml and contained 30ml of the gel, 180ml space for culture medium and about 2ml of void. The gel size was 76 cm 2 in irradiated area and 0.40cm in thickness. The bottle was used in an upright position (Fig. 1B) and irradiated from the gel-attached side. The bottle was stoppered with a silicon plug. Unless otherwise stated, two needles for withdrawal of produced gas and culture medium sample were stabbed through the plug. The needle for culture withdrawal was stoppered with a three-way plastic valve. The first pre-culture was for Lb.delbrueckii. It was performed with a diluted PGY medium for 2 days (see the text). After changing PGY medium for gL medium, the second pre-culture for Rb.sphaeroides RV was done for a day. Hydrogen production experiments were started with gL medium changed for gG medium. Hydrogen gas produced was collected into a graduated cylinder through a plastic tube (Tygon (Saint-Gobain, Tokyo)) introduced from the needle."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis The hydrogen concentration in the collected gas was analyzed by a Shimadzu GCR1A gas-chromatograph equipped with molecular sieve 5A column ( 3.0 mm ∅ × 150 mm ) . The detector was a thermal conductivity detector, and the oven temperature was 80 ∘ C . The carrier gas was argon (50ml/min). Organic acids produced by Lb.delbrueckii were analyzed by a Shimadzu LC10A HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatograph) equipped with Ultron PS-80H column (cation exchanger, 8.0 mm ∅ × 300 mm , Shinwa Chemicals, Tokyo) at 60 ∘ C . The moving phase was a diluted perchloric acid (about 0.1%); pH was adjusted to 2.1 by the addition of concentrated perchloric acid to distilled water. The flow rate was 1ml/min. The detector was a spectrophotometer (210nm wavelength). The glucose concentration in gG medium was determined by using ‘Glucose CII–Test’ (a kit with glucose oxidase, Wako Chemicals, Tokyo)."
5,Results and discussion,"Lb. delbrueckii NBRC13953 and Rb. sphaeroides RV that had been separately grown in the respective culture media were co-immobilized, pre-cultivated first in PGY medium and then in gL medium so as to be further grown and activated, and finally incubated in gG medium for hydrogen production. First, the effect of the PGY medium concentration used in the pre-incubation was evaluated by hydrogen production in gG medium (Fig. 2 ). The dilution ratio of PGY medium affected hydrogen production; a 1 5 diluted PGY medium gave an optimum for hydrogen evolution in gG medium. The sole substrate, glucose, was first converted by Lb.delbrueckii to lactate, which was then converted to hydrogen and carbon dioxide by RV. It was estimated that a highly diluted PGY medium would give insufficient cell growth and/or lactate-producing activity of Lb.delbrueckii, and that too much growth of Lb.delbrueckii caused in the original concentration of PGY medium might result in too high production of lactate damaging Rb.sphaeroides RV by lowering pH. Therefore, the PGY concentration was fixed at 1 5 in the first pre-cultivation, and the effect on hydrogen production of the cell concentration ratio in the co-immobilization was studied twice (Figs. 3 A and 4). In the first run (Fig. 3A), the OD ratio of Lb.delbrueckii to Rb.sphaeroides RV of 1:3 or 1:5 gave the maximal hydrogen production. As described above, there might be some optimal conditions in bacterial concentration ratio for cooperative conversion of glucose to hydrogen gas via lactate because an appropriate supply of lactate by Lb.delbrueckii should be required for hydrogen production by Rb.sphaeroides RV. Glucose was consumed mostly in 3 to 4 days (Fig. 3B). The second run of the co-immobilized culture gave the highest yield of 7.1mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose (Fig. 4 ) when the OD ratio of Rb.sphaeroides RV to Lb.delbrueckii was 1:5. The yield of hydrogen per one mole of glucose was calculated as the ratio of hydrogen totally produced to the amount of glucose in gG medium (4.5mmol). Under the conditions adopted, the co-immobilized culture produced a negligible amount of hydrogen in g medium (the omission of glucose from gG medium). The optimal immobilizing ratio of Rb.sphaeroides RV to Lb.delbruecki may be 1:5 rather than 1.7:5. This experiment was carried out using Roux bottles stoppered with a plug having a sole needle for withdrawal of gas evolved. There might be a little contamination of oxygen from the air, a strong inhibitor for hydrogen production, in the withdrawal process of culture medium, or a little permeation of the gas through invisible gaps around a needle in the plug, resulting in better hydrogen production than in Roux bottles with the plug having two needles. The photosynthetic activity of Rb.sphaeroides RV is limited by light energy. Although a high cell concentration limits light energy supply due to self-shadowing, 4mm thickness of agar did not cause self-shadowing [11]. The main fermentative products by the immobilized sole culture of Lb.delbrueckii were lactic acid and acetic acid (Fig. 5 ) according to the HPLC analysis. Acetate is not a suitable substrate for hydrogen production by Rb.sphaeroides RV [7], but is prone to accumulation of poly-(hydroxybutyrate) [12]. Acetic acid produced by Lb.delbrueckii was expected to be used by Rb.sphaeroides RV. Although there is little information about the metabolic fate of acetate in nitrogen-fixing photosynthetic bacteria in the presence of both acetate and lactate, acetate production by Lb.delbrueckii may reduce the total yield of hydrogen gas from glucose in the co-immobilized system. We are now investigating higher and purer lactate fermenting microorganisms."
