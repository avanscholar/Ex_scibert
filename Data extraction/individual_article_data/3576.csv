0,Introduction,"The fermentative phase of anaerobic digestion is able to generate several products which may be of interest in an environment where energy resources are increasingly restricted. With depleting fossil energy resources and climate change effects on the global environment, there is a pressing need to develop clean and renewable energy sources. Hydrogen, a particular focus of this paper, is a clean energy carrier when produced by dark fermentation using mixed substrates or biomass crops and is increasingly seen as a relevant contributor to sustainably produced carbon neutral energy (Maddy et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2007; Hussy et al., 2005; Hawkes et al., 2007). The microbial breakdown of organic compounds under anoxic or anaerobic fermentative conditions combined with specific controlled process parameters (environmental conditions) such as pH, species concentrations or hydraulic retention time (HRT), produces hydrogen. The process involves a wide variety of microorganisms working collectively to produce hydrogen, VFAs, CO2 and other products. Many batch and continuous experimental studies have investigated the production of bio-hydrogen under varying substrate and operational regimes (Lay et al., 1999; Hussy et al., 2005; Khanal et al., 2006; Hawkes et al., 2007). Dynamic modelling has been extensively used in environmental biotechnology, for process design, determination of optimal operating conditions, operator training and the control of biological wastewater systems such as anaerobic digestion. Over the years various modelling approaches representing anaerobic digestion have been developed, in pursuit of a better understanding of the microbial and system dynamics for different feeding regimes and environmental conditions (Pavlostathis and Gossett, 1986; Siegrist et al., 1993; Kalyuzhnyi, 1997; Angelidaki et al., 1999). As a response to the need for a generic model, the IWA Task Group for Mathematical Modelling of Anaerobic Digestion Processes published the Anaerobic Digestion Model No.1 (ADM1) (Batstone et al., 2002). The ADM1 is a generic model developed with an aim to establish a common platform for modelling anaerobic digestion processes and for further model development and validation studies. Since its publication the model has been extensively used, analysed, and extended (Batstone et al., 2006; Fedorovich et al., 2003; Ruiz et al., 2004) to represent a large plurality of anaerobic wastewater systems. The modelling structure represents an established compromise among the leading researchers in the field of anaerobic digestion modelling. Some limitations have been identified in ADM1 (Batstone et al., 2006; Kleerebezem and van Loosdrecht, 2006) that limit its applicability to non-methanogenic systems. One key limitation is the inadequate regulation mechanism for products from glucose fermentation. This has serious implications in modelling the dark fermentative bio-hydrogen production process using ADM1. Studies on fermentative hydrogen production with glucose as substrate by mixed microbial flora have shown that the distribution of products from glucose metabolism change as a function of environmental conditions such as HRT, pH, substrate concentration and stirring velocity (Fang and Liu, 2002; Van Ginkel and Logan, 2005a; Aceves-Lara et al., in press). Kinetic based modelling of the fermentative bio-hydrogen process has previously been used to evaluate the metabolism of glucose fermentation by selected clostridium species in batch cultures (Lin et al., 2007). A modelling approach based on energetics and metabolic networks has been recently presented as an alternative to multiple biomass models like ADM1 (Rodríguez et al., 2008). An initial model was proposed to mechanistically describe formation of products in anaerobic fermentations (Rodríguez et al., 2006a) and the predictions of this model were integrated in ADM1 as a variable stoichiometry function (Rodríguez et al., 2006b). The objective of this study is to investigate and extend the applicability of ADM1 to fermentative bio-hydrogen processes. For this purpose a variable stoichiometry approach for the ADM1 glucose degradation process is used, based entirely on experimentally estimated yield values as function of the concentration of acidic product in the medium. Validation of the modelling approach is conducted against experimental data from a continuously operated fermentative hydrogen reactor at different feed substrate concentration values."
1,Continuous bio-hydrogen production experiment,"Data generated from a laboratory scale experiment to produce hydrogen using sucrose as substrate has been used in this study. The experimental system consists of a CSTR with a working volume 9.3L, operated over 450h (Kyazze et al., 2006). A constant HRT of 12h, (preceded by 19h of operation in batch mode), and a temperature of 35°C were maintained throughout the operating period. Data were collected during reactor operation in continuous mode at different influent sucrose concentrations namely 20, 40, 50, and 10g/L maintained over 10, 6, 13, and 6 HRTs, respectively. Table 1 shows the experimental influent concentrations schedule. The total gas flow rate, %CO2 and %H2 were measured online and VFAs, TSS, VSS, residual sucrose and other species were measured off-line. A fully detailed description of the experiments can be found in Kyazze et al. (2006). The pH was regulated using a pH metre/controller (Mettler Toledo, Leicester, UK). The pH metre was directly connected to an online data acquisition system. The set points on the controller were chosen to maintain the reactor pH within 0.05 pH units of the chosen operating pH by activating a pump when the lower threshold value was reached, adding 1M NaOH to the reactor until the upper threshold value was reached. Although the reactor pH was controlled, Fig. 1 shows that the actual pH values fell below the intended control limits (i.e. 5.2–5.3) during the highest influent concentrations periods. The distribution of substrate COD converted into products is shown in Fig. 2 in relationship with the concentration of undissociated acids in the medium. The calculation is based on off-line experimental averaged values corresponding to manually selected pseudo steady state points (at near constant volumetric gas production and VFA concentration). A significant COD imbalance can be observed in Fig. 2, at the higher concentrations of acids in the medium, which also correspond to the higher influent substrate concentration periods. This imbalance indicates the presence of an unaccounted (and unmeasured) product that needed to be determined in order to utilise the experimental data for modelling. Acidogenesis of glucose, or carbohydrate rich substrates, is known to simultaneously produce hydrogen, carbon dioxide, VFAs, and in some cases depending on the operating conditions, lactate and alcohols. Studies in dark fermentative bio-hydrogen have revealed the presence of lactate, butyrate, acetate and ethanol as the major constituent products. Presence of lactate was reported, mainly at low pH, in studies on glucose fermentation by mixed culture and was found to be in higher concentration during transient conditions such as pH changes, sudden increase in substrate concentration and dilution rates (Tanisho and Ishiwata, 1995; Temudo et al., 2007). In addition to the COD balance, a total carbon balance was also performed based on the selected data at pseudo steady state. A COD/C ratio for the missing product(s) at an average value of circa 28gCOD/molC was obtained. The fact that the COD/C ratio of lactate (32gCOD/molC) is close to the ratio calculated for the unknown product from the measured data, suggests lactate as a good candidate for the unmeasured product, more plausibly, if combined with small quantities of formate (16gCOD/molC). The choice of lactate (with a low pKa of 3.08) as candidate for the missing unmeasured products is also consistent with the amounts of alkali added to maintain the pH values recorded in the experimental system. The aforementioned literature reports of elevated lactate concentrations at high substrate concentrations, the consistent COD/C ratio and the consistent alkali addition, strongly support the assumption that the missing COD can be attributed mainly to lactate. Previous anaerobic digestion models developed by Costello et al. (1991), Romli et al. (1995), and Batstone et al. (2000), had implemented lactate as an intermediate. The ADM1, however, which was originally formulated for anaerobic methanogenic systems, does not include lactate. Relatively low concentrations and fast intermediate degradation rates in methanogenic and low loaded reactors were the reasons for their exclusion (Batstone et al., 2002). It is recommended, however, that measurements of all major products are conducted for each specific system to obtain more accurate estimations of the yield values to be used in the model."
2,Modelling methodology,"The ADM1 model comprises 7 groups of bacteria whose activities have been formulated into 26 dynamic state concentration variables and 19 kinetic bioconversion processes coupled to 3 gas–liquid transfer processes. Values for kinetic parameters and constants were suggested by Batstone et al. (2002) in their original model report, derived mainly from a review of previous anaerobic digestion models and they represent typical values applied to anaerobic treatment of a wide range of waste streams. As is the case with most pre-existing anaerobic digestion models, ADM1 is structured with constant-stoichiometry for all its embedded conversion processes. If ADM1 is to be applied to, e.g. the bio-hydrogen production processes from carbohydrate as substrate, modelling the carbohydrate degradation using a fixed stoichiometry approach may lead to unrealistic predictions. It is known that the product distribution changes as a function of environmental variables such as pH or the redox state of the system (Mosey, 1983; Costello et al., 1991). A recent study demonstrated that ADM1 applicability could be extended to non-methanogenic fermentation systems by considering a variable stoichiometry for the glucose degradation process while not significantly affecting the predictions for methanogenic systems (Rodríguez et al., 2006b). This approach changes stoichiometry factors during simulation as a function of a selected environmental variable, while keeping mass and charge balances closed. A similar methodology is applied here where the yields of hydrogen, acetate, butyrate and biomass from glucose are calculated by interpolation from experimental values measured at different pseudo steady state total undissociated acid concentrations, which is the variable selected to change product yield values."
3,Variable yields as a function of acids concentration,"3.1 Variable yields as a function of acids concentration Studies on continuous hydrogen production with clostridial microflora have shown acetate and butyrate as major end-products, with butyrate production exceeding acetate production. Both undissociated and dissociated forms of VFAs may act as barriers for the growth of microorganisms. The amount of butyrate and acetate (butyrate to acetate (B/A) ratios) metabolised have been found to be directly proportional to H2 yields (Kim et al., 2006) and are also quantitative indicators of substrate (glucose) metabolism and H2 production (Hawkes et al., 2007). The concentration of acids has important bioenergetic implications associated to transport of species (acidic) across the membrane of the cells. Depending on the medium concentrations (and mainly on pH) the transport of acids over the cellular membranes can lead to generation or consumption of energy (proton motive energy or ATP) (Konings et al., 1995). At high extracellular concentrations energy is consumed to excrete the undissociated acidic products from the cells whereas, at low extracellular concentrations energy is conserved transporting an organic acid. In addition, undissociated acids can permeate the bacterial cell membrane and at high concentrations, the pH gradient across the membrane may collapse, leading to inhibition of bacterial metabolism. All this can cause microorganisms to change to different product formation pathways or select for alternative organisms. Mitchell (1998) has found accumulation of undissociated butyric acid in the cell, which can pass through the cell wall leading to a decrease in pH inside the membrane, to be the key factor for a metabolic shift (change in metabolic pathways) from acid to solvent production. Thus the cells prefer the production of a non-acidic compound (ethanol, butanol) due to the accumulation of acids in the medium. This shift can be a mechanism for the cell to maintain its homeostasis. Studies by Van Ginkel and Logan (2005b), Zheng and Yu (2005), and Wang et al. (2008) have revealed the inhibitory role of VFAs and their significance in affecting the product distribution from glucose, hence their stoichiometric coefficients. Similar to chemical reactions, microbially catalysed reactions are governed by thermodynamic laws. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) must be negative to allow for positive fluxes for the bioreactions. The free energies of the acidic products, which are a function of concentration, may act as thermodynamic barriers for end-product yields, such as hydrogen in the case of bio-hydrogen production. Rodríguez et al. (2006a) have recently proposed a model which incorporates these bioenergetic effects and the role of VFAs and other species concentrations in influencing the product spectrum for mixed culture fermentations of glucose. Taking into consideration these bioenergetic mechanisms the stoichiometry of products from glucose metabolism is considered as a function of the total undissociated (highly pH dependent) acids concentration in the medium. Since, pH alone does not account for the concentration effect, total concentration of undissociated acids was the variable selected to instigate the yield variations proposed in the model modification. Experimentally estimated product and biomass yields for ADM1 are presented in Fig. 3 as a function of the measured total undissociated acids concentration (including the estimated lactate used to close COD balances). These parameter values have been heuristically determined, using only the data from assumed pseudo steady state conditions for each loading rate and discarding data from the transient conditions. At each time instant of the modified ADM1 simulation, the total concentration of undissociated acids is calculated from the current acid concentrations and pH. From this value the biomass yield and the acetate, butyrate and hydrogen catabolism ADM1 yields are computed by linear interpolation from the values in Fig. 3. The remaining COD is allocated to lactate to maintain a closed COD balance all times during simulations. These values (Y su, f h2_su, f ac_su, f pro_su, f lac_su) are then updated in the ADM1 Peterson matrix in the row corresponding to the glucose degradation process. More data values for yield variation (i.e. more points in Fig. 3) may be incorporated at anytime if available, in order to achieve a more accurate and detailed description of the products variability. Depending on the model implementation software the stoichiometry modification can be conducted immediately before the multiplication of the Petersen matrix by the vector of reaction rates and after the states and pH computation (since they are required to evaluate the yield values, see Fig. 3)."
4,Model modifications,"3.2 Model modifications The ADM1 model structure has been modified to allow for the dynamic variation of the sugar degradation product yields as a function of the total undissociated acids concentrations in the reactor. In addition to this modification, lactate has also been included as an additional glucose degradation product. During simulation the yield values of acetate, butyrate, hydrogen and biomass are calculated by linear interpolation between the experimentally determined values shown in Fig. 3, as functions of the instantaneous total acids concentration value. A proportion of the substrate is also assumed to be degraded to lactate and its yield is calculated in order to close the COD balance of the sugar degradation process at all times. Two processes, one for the uptake of lactate and another for the decay of the lactate degrading biomass were added to accommodate lactate metabolism into the ADM1 structure. However, the short (12h) HRT operating regime of the non-methanogenic systems of this study allowed only for glucose degrading microorganisms to be maintained in the reactor while other slow growing organisms are washed out. Further significant degradation of lactate and the other fermentation products does not occur, meaning that lactate degradation parameters have negligible influence in this study (similar kinetic parameter values to those for propionate degradation have been used). Table 2 represents the stoichiometry (Peterson matrix) of the glucose degradation process in the modified ADM1 with lactate incorporated into the model."
5,Model simulations,"3.3 Model simulations Simulations have been conducted using a MATLAB™/Simulink® ADM1 implementation in molar units (Rodríguez et al., 2006b) with the modifications indicated and incorporating a pH control system. A pH controller was implemented for this specific study to track as accurate as possible the experimental pH values. This is achieved by addition of NaOH in the feeding stream to replicate in simulation, the experimental system. No parameter modifications were made to the standard parameter values reported by Batstone et al. (2002), with the exception of the maximum glucose uptake rate (k m,su), which was altered from the standard ADM1 parameter value (of 0.208molSsu/molC-xsu h). In order to more accurately describe the maximum sugar uptake rate in the system and the effects of decreased biomass yield, the maximum specific sugar uptake rate was directly determined from the observed sugar consumption rate (at the highest residual sugar concentrations) and from the biomass concentration measurements available. A value of 0.109molSsu/molC-xsu h was taken. It is recommended that this parameter is directly estimated for each specific system when possible. The proposed ADM1 modification has been applied to the laboratory scale experiments described above in order to test its applicability to represent non-methanogenic systems and to validate the assumption that accumulation of undissociated acidic products in the medium is a primary cause for product yield variations. Simulations have been conducted by using only standard parameter values for the unaltered ADM1 processes."
6,Results and discussion,"Figs. 4 and 5 present the simulation results using the experimentally calculated product yield values from Fig. 3. Simulation data using the standard ADM1 are also shown for comparison. The sucrose feed has been assumed equivalent to two molecules of glucose considering its hydrolysis rate is relatively instantaneous. The modified ADM1 model is able to predict both the dynamic and the pseudo steady state concentrations of acetate and butyrate as well as the total gas and hydrogen production rates over the wide range of influent substrate concentration values. Fig. 4 indicates also an adequate prediction of the CO2 considering that only H2 and CO2 are present in the gas. The proposed model was also able to replicate the dynamics of decrease and resurgence in H2 as reported by Kyazze et al. (2006) for a substrate concentration of 50g/L. This behaviour was originally attributed to substrate and product inhibition by Kyazze et al. (2006) but the simulation results point to a combination of both inadequate pH control (see Fig. 1 with actual pH values during that period dropping lower than pH 4.8) and accumulation of acidic products. The low pH values cause both a general inhibition (well described using the standard pH inhibition factors from ADM1) together with its consequent effects on the protonated/ionised ratio of the acidic products, both decreasing the biomass growth. Although Table 1 shows that the continuous operation started at an influent substrate concentration of 20g/L during the period 19.65–66h, as originally reported by Kyazze et al. (2006), the experimental data (see Figs. 4 and 5) with H2 production rate in the range of approx. 4.37±0.5 LH2/(L·d), suggest that the actual value may have been significantly lower during this initial period. The hydrogen production rate almost corresponds to that achievable at 10g/L influent sucrose concentration (Hussy et al., 2005; Kyazze et al., 2007). Based on these observations, the initial period (between 19.65 and 67h) has been simulated with feed condition of sucrose to be 10g/L. In Figs. 4 and 5 simulation of both cases is shown for comparison (dotted lines). The hydrogen production yield seems to be negatively correlated to the lactate production. This effect is also reported in the literature and supported by the fact that hydrogen production is mainly associated with Acetyl-CoA derivatives involving ferredoxin as electron carrier. This has been comprehensively documented by Temudo et al. (2007) who quantified and correlated the amount of Acetyl-CoA derived fermentation products and the amount of hydrogen and formate generated in a glucose-fed chemostat. By using experimentally determined variable product and biomass yields for the sugar degradation process, the ADM1 model could be applied to describe a non-methanogenic fermentative reactor, requiring a minimum parameter calibration apart from the experimental determination of pseudo steady state biomass and product yields. The limitations in ADM1 recently acknowledged Batstone et al. (2006) associated with glucose degradation are partially overcome by this approach. The approach does not present a modelling strategy for investigating glucose fermentation but a suitable methodology, which extends the applicability of a model well known by the research community (i.e. the ADM1). A variable stoichiometry for the glucose degradation process is shown to be a suitable way to integrate a metabolic variation into ADM1 as it has also been reported recently by Rodríguez et al. (2006b). The simulation results also support the hypothesis that the accumulation of undissociated acidic products is the main driver for changes in the product yields. This is further supported by bioenergetic mechanisms associated with the accumulation of those products and their effect on the microbial metabolism."
7,Conclusions,"A modelling approach considering variable product yields from the sugar degradation process allows for the application of the ADM1 to non-methanogenic anaerobic systems, including continuous bio-hydrogen production processes. A modelling approach, which considers the concentration of undissociated acidic products as the main governing variable for the product yields (including VFAs and hydrogen) is an appropriate modification of ADM1 to describe fermentation of sugars in non-methanogenic anaerobic systems. Incorporating this dependence in the model implicitly also includes pH effects by affecting the protonated/ionised species ratio of the acidic products in the medium. Established bioenergetic understanding of the product transport mechanisms between bacteria and media mechanistically supports the approach adopted. An experimentally based correlation of these yields with the total concentration of acidic products in the medium appears to be a suitable manner to easily incorporate the variable yields in ADM1. Such modification is easy to integrate in any ADM1 implementation, by including a method to modify the stoichiometry matrix as a function of total undissociated acid concentrations. The simulation results obtained support the approach by providing good predictions of the dynamics in a continuous bio-hydrogen production reactor fed with sucrose, over a wide range of influent substrate concentrations. The model predicts the stationary and dynamic behaviour of not only hydrogen but also butyrate and acetate concentrations over the complete range of applied loading rates. This description includes a systematic inhibition and recovery of the system at the highest loading rates by the combined effects of pH and total acidic product concentrations in the system. The results also suggest that a very accurate simulation of the pH is required to achieve good simulation results with the ADM1, particularly at high influent concentrations. The approach presented extends the applicability of the ADM1 to anaerobic non-methanogenic systems including continuous bio-hydrogen production, two-stage anaerobic digestion and possibly other fermentation systems."
