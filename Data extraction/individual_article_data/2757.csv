0,Introduction,"The unrestricted use of fossil fuels-based energy has severely hampered our environment, and caused global warming and greenhouse effect. Now, the decreasing availability of fossil fuels has drastically raised the prices of liquid and gaseous fuels worldwide. Therefore, developing renewable energy is indispensable. Anaerobic fermentation technology showed great potential for biogas (hydrogen and methane) and alcohol (bioethanol and biobutanol) production. These biofuels could be converted into energy through combustion engine or fuel cell [1]. Among all carriers of renewable energy, bioH2 is an ideal and clean source of energy and its research is becoming more and more popular in recent years due to several benefits to its credit [2]. On the other hand, ethanol has remained the major commercial biofuel around the world and is blended with gasoline in several countries. In the past, using crops such as corn, sugarcane and sorghum as feedstock for producing bioH2 and ethanol by dark fermentation was not cost-effective, and raised the food and fuel competition issue [2]. Therefore, organic wastewater is a potential feedstock for bioH2 and ethanol production [3]. Tofu is a common food in Asian countries, and during its production large amounts of wastewaters are produced as it is a water-intensive process. About 60 kg of soybeans and 2.7 L of water are required to produce 80 kg of tofu which ends up with a large amount of wastewater up to 2.6 L [4]. The wastewater is a serious environmental pollutant due to its high organic content comprising mainly of reducing sugars, sucrose, starch and volatile fatty acids. Owing to its non-cellulosic nature with high carbohydrate and proteins, tofu-processing wastewater (TPW) has the potential to produce biohydrogen and ethanol [5]. Earlier studies on TPW have shown that biohydrogen could be successfully generated through dark and photo fermentation methods [6–9]. These studies also indicate that TPW will not only provide the energy source but also solve the waste treatment problems. Therefore, dual benefits are obtained from fermentation of tofu-processing wastewater, thereby making the process more economical and valuable. Although TPW to biohydrogen conversion is feasible through fermentation, the process however is still in its infancy and needs to be optimized and appropriate conditions for maximal recovery of biohydrogen should be developed. Process factors such as temperature, pH, nutrient, toxic materials, hydraulic retention time and cell density generally affect the anaerobic fermentation pathway strongly [10]. Moreover, to make the H2 and ethanol production process efficient in terms of net energy gain, it is essential to operate the process at mesophilic temperature range. In fact most previous studies were focused on mesophilic conditions [11–14] with only a few which were conducted on thermophilic dark fermentation to produce H2 and ethanol using various other wastes [15,16]. Therefore, it is highly imperative that appropriate experimental design is used to obtain the optimum process conditions, prior to development of sustainable bioenergy process. The optimum conditions required to efficiently convert the TPW into bioH2 and ethanol have been experimentally realized and energy recovery analysis was done to evaluate the process for its suitability as sustainable energy provider onsite i.e. in the tofu-making factory itself."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge and substrate,"2.1 Seed sludge and substrate Two anaerobic sewage sludges (SS1 and SS2) collected from two different wastewater treatment plants in Taiwan were used as seed inoculums for bioenergy production from TPW. TPW was obtained from a local tofu factory (Taichung, Taiwan). The characteristics of the seed inoculums and TPW are given in Table 1 . The TPW was treated at temperature 70 °C for 30 min to inhibit the hydrogen consuming bacteria."
3,Batch optimization of environmental factors,"2.2 Batch optimization of environmental factors Batch experiments were conducted in glass bottles with a total working volume of 60 mL which includes 30 mL of TPW, 15 mL of seed sludge and 10 mL of nutrient solution. The nutrient solution contained sufficient inorganic supplements in the following composition (g/L): NH4HCO3 5.24, K2HPO4 0.125, MgCl2.6H2O 0.1, MnSO4.6H2O 0.015, FeSO4.7H2O 0.025, CuSO4.5H2O 0.005, CoCl2.5H2O 0.000125 and NaHCO3 6.72 [17]. The initial pH was adjusted as per the experimental requirement using HCl, NaOH and deionized water (5 mL). Argon gas was purged for 5 min in order to make an anaerobic condition and then incubated in a shaker incubator with agitation speed of 150 rpm. 2.2.1 Inoculum and temperature selection SS1 and SS2 sewage sludges with volatile suspended solids concentration (VSS) of 10 g/L were seeded and cultivated at temperatures 35 and 55 °C and initial pH 7.0 using TPW concentration of 20 g COD/L to investigate the optimal inoculum and temperature. 2.2.2 Effect of initial pH The effect of initial pH ranging from 4.0 to 8.0 with an interval of 0.5 was investigated at cultivation temperature of 35 °C and substrate concentration of 20 g COD/L using SS1 seed inoculum. 2.2.3 Effect of substrate concentration The substrate concentration ranging from 10 to 40 g COD/L was optimized at initial pH 6.5 and temperature 35 °C using SS1 inoculum."
4,Continuous operation and experimental setup,"2.3 Continuous operation and experimental setup A continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with a working volume of 1.0 L was seeded with SS1 and operated at a temperature of 35 °C and fed with TPW 20 g COD/L at HRT of 24–6 h. The fermentor was constantly mixed at 75 rpm with a stirrer. A pH of 5.5 was maintained using a pH controller and 1 M NaOH and HCl. The HRT was shortened when a steady-state condition with slight variations (less than ±10%) in the gas production, volatile fatty acid (VFA) and solids concentrations was reached."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods 2.4.1 Chemical analysis The volume of biogas was measured by a gas tight glass syringe in batch array and a gas bag in continuous operation, respectively. The gas composition was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (8700T, China Chromatograph, Taiwan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Liquid samples were centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatants were taken for analysis. Alcohol and VFAs were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with flame ionization detector. The detailed operation conditions of GCs for gas and liquid phase analysis are given elsewhere [18]. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), alkalinity, pH, NH3-N and VSS were measured according to the procedures of Standard Methods [19]. 2.4.2 Data analysis The hydrogen production potential, maximum hydrogen production rate and lag phase time under each experimental condition were obtained from the modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)) [20]. The modified Gompertz equation is a suitable model for sketching bacterial growth rate versus incubation time and has been developed to describe the anaerobes converting organic solids wastes to methane and the cumulative hydrogen production curve as well. (1) H ( t ) = P · exp { − exp [ R m · e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } H(t) is the cumulative H2 production (mL); P is the H2 production potential (mL); R m is the maximum H2 production rate (mL/h); e is 2.71828; λ is the lag phase time (h) and t is the cultivation time (h). The cumulative H2 production curve was non-linearly modeled using Eq. (1) and the parameters P, R m and λ were estimated using Sigma plot software 10.0 (Systat Software Inc., USA). Peak hydrogen production yield (HY, mL/g COD) was defined as hydrogen production per adding substrate. Hydrogen production rate (HPR, L/L-d) value was determined based on the R m data obtained from the modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)) in batch test and daily hydrogen production quantity per working volume in continuous system. Batch experiment was performed in triplicate and more than two sampling points were taken in continuous system. Average results in batch and CSTR are presented."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Environmental factors optimization,"3.1 Environmental factors optimization 3.1.1 Effect of inoculum and temperature The selection of digestion temperature and seed sludge as mixed culture is very crucial for an anaerobic fermentation process [10,21]. In the present study, 2 different temperatures (35 and 55 °C) and 2 different seed sludges (SS1 and SS2) were used to evaluate the hydrogen production performance and obtain the best criteria for maximum production from TPW. The results, as shown in Table 2 , indicate that both the seed sludges were capable of producing H2 from TPW without any methane generation. The temperature variation did not affect the HY significantly. The maximum HY of 61.2 mL/g COD was obtained at 35 °C using SS1 and TPW. As shown in Table 2, after anaerobic fermentation for 180 h, the soluble COD removal (9.6%) at thermophilic condition (55 °C) was less than (12.8%) at mesophilic condition (35 °C). Soluble carbohydrates were degraded from 6 g/L to 0.8 g/L with the removal efficiency of 86% at both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. NH3-N concentration after fermentation was 15–85% higher than initial condition which indicates the degradation of urea, glutamate and protein as reported in a previous study [22]. Biohydrogen production activity gets inhibited by increasing NH3-N concentration, however the concentration of NH3-N was lower than the inhibitory concentration (above 2 g/L) as mentioned by Salerno et al. [23]. Table 3 shows that acetate and n-butyrate were the main soluble metabolic products (SMP). Ethanol and butanol were observed at thermophilic condition using SS1 inoculum. No lactate was produced in this experiment. It showed that heat treatment of 70 °C for 30 min could inhibit the activity of lactate producing bacteria. 3.1.2 Effect of pH pH is a fundamental factor for hydrogen production, since a pH lower than 5 can induce bacterial sporulation or shift metabolic activity to solvent formation [21]. Moreover, the optimal pH value for obtaining the maximum H2 production depends on the composition of the substrate used for fermentation, and varies with the type of feedstock. For example, the effect of pH values ranging from 4.7 to 5.9 on H2 production from liquid swine manure supplemented with glucose by mixed cultures in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor showed pH 5 as optimal at 37 °C with a yield of 1.48 L-H2/L [21]. The effect of initial pH on HPR, HY and SMP is shown in Fig. 1 . Our results showed pH 5.5–6.0 as the optimum for peak H2 production of 129 mL and HY of 107.5 mL-H2/g COD with average hydrogen content of 41–44% at 35 °C. The peak HPR of 5.9 L-H2/L-d was obtained at pH 6.5 (Table 4 ). Methane production of 228–231 mL and methane content of 36–38% were measured at pH 7.5–8.0 (data not shown). A wide pH range also influences the spectrum of product composition (acetate, butyrate, alcohols, lactate etc.) during anaerobic fermentation. The soluble COD was degraded from 17.2 g/L to 0.9–13.3 g/L at the tested pH values. The soluble COD removals were 43.3% and 46.6% at pH 5.5 and 6.0, respectively. When initial pH was increased to 7.5 and 8.0, the soluble COD removal reached to 95% which was because of the weak alkaline condition that was suitable for methane production in the anaerobic environment [24]. As methanogens could utilize organic acid such as acetate and butyrate to produce methane, the final total volatile fatty acid concentration after 48 d cultivation was lower than 250 mg COD/L (Table 5 ). The variation of NH3-N concentration after fermentation in this experiment was similar with the inoculum and temperature experiment above. The total carbohydrate removal was higher than 60% at all pH values. Peak total carbohydrate removal of about 82% was obtained at pH 5.5 and 6. Table 5 shows acetate and butyrate as the major SMP in the pH range of 4–8. Acetate and butyrate were 38–44% and 44–46% of SMP at pH 5.5 and 6.0, respectively. In a previous study on tofu-processing waste, acetate and butyrate were the main liquid-state metabolites produced during the thermophilic fermentation process [9]. 3.1.3 Effect of substrate concentration On varying the TPW concentration from 10 to 40 g-COD/L, it was found that 20 g-COD/L was the optimum concentration which can give the peak HY of 99.2 mL/g-COD (Table 6 ). However, the peak HPR of 6.6 L/L-d was obtained at 30 g-COD/L of TPW (Fig. 2 ). The HY dropped as the TPW concentration was increased further to 20 g-COD/L (Fig. 2). Often it is noted that higher concentration of any substrate leads to a drop in HY [21]. In general, higher substrate concentrations imply higher product concentrations in batch reactor, leading to higher energy requirement for transport of the products against a steep concentration gradient, ultimately leading to decreased product formation [22]. The main SMP were acetate and butyrate as in the above experiments. However, shift in the metabolic pathway was noted at higher concentration of TPW above 10 g-COD/L. At TPW concentration of 15, 20, 30 and 40 g COD/L, the butyrate composition was 50–58% and acetate was 20–25%, whereas at 10 g-COD/L the acetate and butyrate concentrations were 51% and 23% (Fig. 3 ). Thus, acetate pathway was followed at low TPW concentration while butyrate pathway was followed at higher TPW concentrations for biohydrogen production."
8,Continuous operation,"3.2 Continuous operation 3.2.1 Hydrogen production rate Fig. 4 shows the daily variations of hydrogen production performance in a CSTR with initial HRT of 24 h. The HRT was shortened to 6 h step by step. Batch mode operation was used as the start-up strategy as followed elsewhere [25]. The HPR and hydrogen content were 0.5 L/L-d and 50%, respectively, during the batch operation. When the reactor was fed continuously at HRT 24 h, the hydrogen content decreased to ∼19%. The HPR increased rapidly from 0.83 L/L-d at HRT 12 h to 1.47 L/L-d at beginning of HRT 8 h. At the HRT of 8 h the HPR could reach up to 1.77 L/L-d. However, when the HRT was shortened from 8 h to 6 h, the HPR rapidly reduced to 1.2 L/L-d and hydrogen content dropped to 10%. HPR was found to constantly decline during the operation at HRT 6 h. After 5 days operation at HRT 6 h the HPR reduced below 0.5 L/L-d with hydrogen content of 5.1%. Therefore, in order to restore the CSTR to the performance similar to HRT 8 h, the feeding rate was slowed and HRT was maintained at 8 h. On restoring the HRT to 8 h the HPR peaked to 1.73 ± 0.30 L/L-d. Similar performance of HPR 1.53–2.11 L/L-d and hydrogen content 17–20% was obtained in the second run of HRT 8 h. 3.2.2 Water quality and soluble metabolic products The ORP ranged from −357 to −421 mV at all HRTs during the CSTR operation fed with TPW which were close to the desirable ORP (−200 to −400 mV) for hydrogen production [10]. High VSS of 8.2–11.8 g/L was found at long HRT of 12–24 h; however, at HRT of 8 h and 6 h, the VSS was around 4.0–4.1 g/L. Thus shorter HRT eliminated the slow growing microorganisms thereby reducing the VSS content. The influent COD was 32.3–34.5 g/L and effluent COD was 24.8–27.2 g/L during the continuous operation (Table 7 ). Low COD removal (16.6–25.9%) is often associated with hydrogen fermentation due to accumulation of reduced end-products such as ethanol, acetate, propionate and butyrate unlike methane fermentation. The carbohydrate removal remained high in all runs of continuous operation (Table 7). Proteins would be degraded to ammonia in the fermentation process and this ammonia could shift the pH of hydrogen fermentation system to basic condition which is unsuitable for production of biohydrogen. The CSTR system could degrade the protein from 1.69 to 2.22 g/L in the influent to 0.53–0.63 g/L in the effluent, with the removal efficiency of 67–69% (Table 7 and Fig. 5 ). As a result the NH3-N would accumulate, as evident from the batch experiments, and might become the cause of low hydrogen production efficiency of the CSTR. In addition, the sulfate content found in the CSTR could also affect the anaerobic biohydrogen fermentation [26]. The presence of sulfate in TPW was due to addition of calcium sulfate in Tofu making process. The sulfate concentration in the effluent of the CSTR was 2603–2666 mg/L at HRT 24, 12, and 8 h and the sulfate removal was 11–30% (Table 7 and Fig. 5). But the effluent sulfate concentration increased to 6861 mg/L at HRT 6 h which might be due to the wash out of sulfate reducing bacteria at such high dilution rate which are responsible for sulfate degradation. A previous study showed that high sulfate concentration (>4000 mg/L) could inhibit the hydrogen production [26]. Therefore, the lower hydrogen production efficiency at HRT 6 h could be attributed to the inhibition effect of high sulfate concentration. Fig. 6 shows the concentrations and compositions of SMP at each HRT applied during the operation of the CSTR. At HRT 8 h, which showed the maximum HPR, the peak SMP concentration of 12.5 g COD/L constituted mainly acetate (38.5%) and butyrate (23.3%), with minor amounts (<20%) of ethanol, propionate and valerate. Jones and Woods [27] stated that acetate and butyrate would be the main SMP for best hydrogen production performance. If the hydrogen production process gets inhibited, the metabolic pathway would shift to produce more of ethanol, butanol, lactate or acetone. As can be seen from the results of the present study there was no lactate formation at HRT 24, 12 and 8 h. But lactate formation was noted at HRT 6 h constituting up to 32.5% of SMP. This directly indicates that lactate production is associated with low hydrogen production rate at the HRT 6 h operation."
9,Heat energy supply from wastewater for a tofu-making factory,"3.3 Heat energy supply from wastewater for a tofu-making factory The heat energy supply for a tofu-making factory is evaluated by the H2 (285.8 J/mmol) and ethanol (1366 J/mmol) production yields and the wastewater quantities [11]. The total energy production efficiency and rate from TPW at various HRTs in CSTR are shown in Table 8 . The peak total energy production efficiency of 485 J/g COD (160 J/g COD from hydrogen and 325 J/g COD from ethanol) and rate of 43.3 kJ/L-d (19.6 kJ/L-d from hydrogen and 23.7 kJ/L-d from ethanol) were obtained at HRT 12 and 8 h, respectively. A local tofu-making factory was taken as a model to calculate the energy production onsite, based on the bioenergy generation from fermentation of TPW. The daily quantities of TPW produced in a tofu-making factory located in Taiwan were ∼250 tons. The annual cost of electricity in the tofu making factory was 144,000 NT$, it means electricity consumption was about 3 × 104 kWh with subsequent heat power consumption of about 1.1 × 105 MJ/y for the tofu-making factory. The annual total energy production was about 380 MJ/y if the energy that is required to heat the hydrogen fermentor to 35 °C and ethanol separation and valorization unit is not taken into account. This total energy production was about 3.5% of the heat power consumption. It could reduce the carbon dioxide emission of 6.65 ton CO2 equivalents/y for power plant."
10,Conclusions,"This study evaluated the potential of TPW to produce bioenergy for use in the tofu-making factory. The results showed that thermophilic and mesophilic fermentation conditions do not affect the HY significantly. The peak HY of 107.5 mL-H2/g COD was obtained at 35 °C and pH 5.5–6.0. Furthermore, the optimum TPW concentration was 20 g-COD/L for peak HY. At pH 7.5–8.0, methane was produced. Peak HPR of 1.73 L H2/L-d was obtained at HRT 8 h during the operation of a CSTR fed with TPW. The main soluble metabolites were acetate and butyrate which are desirable for high hydrogen production performance. NH3-N and SO4 2− accumulation led to decreased HPR when the HRT was shortened to 6 h. Thus, the most suitable HRT for operation of CSTR fed with TPW was found to be 8 h. In addition, the maximum total energy production rate of 43.3 kJ/L-d was obtained at HRT 8 h. The total energy production yield of TPW was estimated to be 380 MJ/y which could support 3.5% of the daily heat power consumption in a tofu-making factory. Thus, tofu-processing wastewater could serve as the major bioenergy provider in a tofu-making factory and can reduce the carbon dioxide emission from the use of fossil fuel. In addition bioenergy recovery from TPW would also save the cost of wastewater treatment to the factory."
