0,Introduction,"Alcohol has many uses. As the use of fossil fuels becomes increasingly detrimental to the environment, one such critical use is as a biofuel. Ethanol is currently the most widely used bio-alcohol fuel due to its relatively mature production infrastructure. However, metabolic engineering of microorganisms and advancement in catalytic gas fermentation has enabled many avenues of biosynthesizing other alcohols, creating a pathway for single component alcohols, multi-component alcohol blends, and water-alcohol blends to serve as potential biofuels. In parallel with the advancement in bio-alcohol synthesis, a considerable amount of research on a number of advanced combustion concepts aims to provide internal combustion engines with high thermal efficiencies and low emissions. With both fields rapidly maturing, there is a strong need for the two fields to come together. In light of this, this work aims to study the potential of biosynthesized alcohol fuels in advanced combustion by considering advanced combustion concepts that control the heat release process via small-to-medium amounts of in-cylinder stratification introduced through the direct injection of fuel. This work is organized into the following subsections: 1. An introduction to stratification-controlled advanced combustion concepts, highlighting the specific fuel properties desirable for each strategy. 2. A brief review of recent progress in the field of bio-alcohol production. 3. An introduction to physical and chemical properties of the alcohols, selecting candidate fuels based on their potential compatibility with the advanced combustion concepts being considered. 4. An analytical assessment of candidate fuels using a metric called normalized φ-sensitivity, which provides information on how the ignition delay distribution in the combustion chamber changes due to a compression stroke injection of fuel."
1,Stratified advanced combustion,"Advanced combustion concepts aim to break the efficiency-emissions tradeoff that exists with the conventional combustion modes: spark ignition (SI) and conventional diesel combustion (CDC). Low temperature combustion (LTC) is a subset of these advanced combustion concepts that provides high thermal efficiency and low particulate matter (PM) and NOx emissions via lean, near-homogeneous, un-throttled operation. Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), the first LTC concept, achieves this goal [1]; however, HCCI is limited to low load operation due to a lack of a heat release control mechanism. The heat release process in HCCI is governed by thermal stratification that forms naturally in the cylinder via heat transfer during the compression stroke [2,3]. The hottest regions in the cylinder ignite first, further compressing and heating the colder regions in the cylinder until they ultimately ignite too in a process known as sequential autoignition. There are numerous next generation LTC concepts that aim to provide a control mechanism over the heat release process using a similar control strategy, namely the direct injection of fuel during the compression stroke. The naming convention of these LTC concepts can be vague, with significant amounts of overlap among them. For example, partially premixed combustion (PPC) describes an advanced compression ignition combustion mode that has some degree of fuel inhomogeneity in the combustion chamber that controls the heat release process [4]. Gasoline compression ignition (GCI) describes a PPC-like combustion mode utilizing gasoline [5]. Partial fuel stratification (PFS) is another PPC-like combustion mode that employs a split injection strategy, where a portion of the fuel is injected during the intake stroke to fully premix with air while the remainder of the fuel is injected during the compression stroke to induce stratification [6]. Thus, the difference between PFS, GCI, and PPC largely lays with their injection strategies. Reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI), which uses two distinct fuels with vastly different reactivities, is a PPC-like combustion mode that creates a reactivity gradient in the cylinder by direct injecting a high reactivity fuel during the compression stroke into premixed air and a low-reactivity fuel [7]. Thermally stratified compression ignition (TSCI), which when employed with a single injection system and a high heat of vaporization fuel or water-fuel mixture, uses a split injection strategy like PFS [8]. The difference between TSCI and PFS is subtle and highlights what should be the primary distinction between all of these stratified advanced LTC concepts – the sequence of autoignition within the stratified charge in the combustion chamber. A common characteristic among all of these combustion modes is the use of a direct injection of fuel during the compression stroke to superimpose a coupled φ-temperature field on top of the naturally formed temperature distribution. This coupled φ-temperature field is a function of injection timing, engine geometry, and bulk charge motion, among other factors. Depending on the nature of the fuel, the heat release process will either proceed from rich-to-lean (like PFS) or lean-to-rich (like TSCI). A rich-to-lean heat release progression means that rich regions ignite first, despite the fact that they may also be colder due to the evaporative cooling of the fuel, followed sequentially by progressively leaner regions. Contrarily, a lean-to-rich heat release progression means that the hot, lean regions ignite first, followed sequentially by progressively richer, colder regions. The two key fuel properties that determine how the heat release process will proceed are φ-sensitivity and cooling potential. φ-sensitivity describes how the ignition delay of a fuel changes with φ. A fuel is considered highly φ-sensitive if its ignition delay rapidly decreases with an increase in φ. This is strongly correlated with the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior of fuels that exhibit low temperature heat release (LTHR) and/or intermediate temperature heat release (ITHR) [9,10]. The cooling potential of a fuel describes the potential change in temperature a fuel can induce via evaporation, given by the following equation: (1) CoolingPotential = φ ∗ h fg , f u e l AFR stoich ∗ C p , a i r where hfg, fuel is the latent heat of vaporization of fuel, φ is the equivalence ratio, AFRstoich is the stoichiometric air–fuel ratio, and cp, air is the specific heat of air. Note that the cooling potential is not only a function of hfg, fuel , but of AFRstoich as well, since a fuel with a lower AFRstoich will require a larger amount of mass for a given φ. Generalizing to maximize clarity, there are two fuel options to choose from: a fuel with little-to-no φ-sensitivity and a high cooling potential, which will burn lean-to-rich, or a fuel with a high φ-sensitivity and a low cooling potential, which will burn rich-to-lean. Therefore, to avoid referring to a class of similar advanced combustion strategies by several different acronyms, a more intuitive way to describe next generation LTC concepts would be as either “lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion” or “rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion.” A schematic illustrating the difference between lean-to-rich and rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion is shown in Fig. 1 . Based on the nature of the fuel requirement for each strategy, they have unique drawbacks. Lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion is more prone to poor combustion efficiency, i.e. high CO and uHC emissions, due to the relatively high autoignition resistance of the single-stage ignition fuels employed. On the other hand, rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion is more prone to particulate matter emissions due to the longer fuel structure and low oxygen content associated with the gasoline-like fuels that exhibit NTC behavior. However, both lean-to-rich and rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion are equally effective at controlling the heat release provided the correct fuel and engine hardware are used to maximize the efficacy of the control strategy used while minimizing their respective drawbacks."
2,Overview of bio-alcohol production,"Alcohols are oxygenated hydrocarbons categorized by having a single hydroxyl group (–OH) bonded to a carbon atom. The location of this hydroxyl group plays a role in the physical and chemical properties of the molecule. Therefore, alcohols can be grouped into three categories based on the number of carbon–carbon bonds that the hydroxyl group-bonded carbon atom has: primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols have one, two, and three carbon–carbon bonds on the hydroxyl group carbon, respectively. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 , using the four butanol isomers as an example. The hydroxyl group of an alcohol fuel polarizes it, with the degree of polarization being inversely related to the spatial distance between the hydroxyl group and the other atoms of the molecule. As a result, the degree of polarization decreases with an increasing number of carbon atoms and, in general, increases when the molecule branches. Polarization of the molecule causes strong intermolecular bonds, resulting in the unique properties of alcohols, such as a low melting point, a high latent heat of vaporization, and a degree of water solubility. Some key fuel properties of various alcohols are displayed in Table 1 ."
3,Bioethanol,"3.1 Bioethanol Ethanol is primarily produced through the fermentation of starch-based crops, like corn or sugarcane. Although more research is needed, this method of production raises valid concerns over potential competition with food sources if the production of ethanol through this method is scaled up to provide a significant fraction of global energy needs [11]. However, bioethanol can be produced, instead, from lignocellulose, the material that makes up most biomass. Lignocellulose primarily consists of three components: lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. While lignin cannot be used to produce ethanol via traditional fermentation, cellulosic ethanol can be produced by fermenting hydrolyzed sugars from cellulose and hemicellulose. Before being hydrolyzed, a pretreatment process must first break down lignin-cellulose-hemicellulose complexes. The specific pretreatment method is generally chosen based on the nature of the biomass in question [12]. After pretreatment, either chemical hydrolysis or enzymatic hydrolysis produces fermentable sugars. Chemical hydrolysis entails steeping the cellulose and hemicellulose in an acidic solution. Sulfuric acid is the most common acid used for chemical hydrolysis, though other acids have been proposed to reduce the production of toxic byproducts and ease the burden of neutralization after hydrolysis [13]. Dilute acidic chemical hydrolysis first converts hemicellulose to both pentose (five-carbon sugar, such as xylose) and hexose (six-carbon sugar, such as glucose). Once the hemicellulose is hydrolyzed, the temperature of the solution is heated to ~ 230 °C to convert the cellulose to glucose [14]. Alternatively, concentrated acid (~70%) may be employed at low temperatures and pressures to produce higher sugar yields than dilute acid. However, this increases the complexity of the solution neutralization and the subsequent removal of salts and fermentation inhibitors [15]. Enzymatic hydrolysis hydrolyzes cellulose and hemicellulose by steeping them in a solution containing enzyme producing micro-organisms, or the enzymes themselves. Enzymatic hydrolysis is theoretically more efficient than chemical hydrolysis and requires significantly less aftertreatment before fermentation. However, its high cost and technological immaturity are currently limiting factors to its production-scale implementation. Current research is exploring “designer enzymes” that improve hydrolysis efficiency while decreasing cost [16]. There is also the potential for bio-engineered yeast strains to both hydrolyze and ferment simultaneously, greatly reducing the complexity and cost of cellulosic ethanol production [17]. Finally, the fermentation process converts sugars to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Fermentation of hexoses using the naturally occurring yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae is up to 95% efficient [18]. Fermenting pentose sugars, on the other hand, requires metabolic engineering of certain strains of yeast/bacteria. The requirement of oxygen during the fermentation process further complicates the fermentation of pentoses and is currently a limiting factor in ethanol yield [19,20]. Despite these challenges and although there is more work to be done, researchers have made significant strides in developing yeast strains for the co-fermentation of pentoses and hexoses [21]. Additionally, cellulosic ethanol can be produced via gas fermentation by fermenting syngas produced from biomass. This is unique from the Fischer Tropsch process, which generates hydrocarbons from syngas using high temperatures and pressures as well as costly catalysts. Instead, gas fermentation employs microorganisms, such as Clostridium Ljungdahlii, undergoing autotrophy with CO as a feedstock [22]. One key advantage of gas fermentation over traditional fermentation is that gas fermentation of biomass can produce alcohol from lignin, which can account for a significant amount of the total biomass [23]. Lignocellulose can come from dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, or agricultural waste, such as corn stover. For example, the crop residue/crop ratio of corn, i.e. the ratio of corn stover/corn grain yield, is ~ 1. Considering the theoretical ethanol yield of corn stover is slightly lower than that of corn grain due to the production of xylose and other five-carbon sugars during the hydrolysis process, the theoretical ethanol yield of the entire crop can increase by nearly 70% if the methods described above are used to produce cellulosic ethanol instead of employing current ethanol production methods that only use the corn grain [24]. Roughly half of the corn stover produced must be retained to prevent soil erosion and carbon depletion, leaving a net theoretical ethanol yield increase of ~ 35% [25]. The production of second-generation bioethanol can therefore increase the yield from each hectare of crop. Additionally, lignocellulose can come from forest or municipal waste [26]. There is ~ 100 million dry tons of forest biomass and waste resource potential currently unused in the US, ranging from forest trimmings to wood chips [27,28]. With potential ethanol yields ranging from of 40–80 gallons/ton of biomass [26] (sugarcane yield: 20–25 gallons/ton and corn yield: 95–125 gallons/ton), 4–8 billion gallons of ethanol can be created from the underutilized resources alone, a significant fraction of the 16.1 billion gallons of ethanol produced in the US in 2018 [29]."
4,Biomethanol production,"3.2 Biomethanol production Unlike ethanol, methanol is traditionally synthesized from non-renewable sources. Fossil fuels (i.e., natural gas) are typically reformed to create syngas, which is then used to produce methanol via catalytic reactions at elevated temperatures and pressures. However, the syngas used to synthesize methanol can easily be created by gasifying any biomass, with little change to the actual production process. As a polar molecule, methanol is miscible with water and will absorb water during the production process. Unlike ethanol, methanol does not form an azeotrope with water, meaning no energy intensive dehydration process is required to fully dry the fuel [30]. For the azeotrope forming alcohols, this energy intensive dehydration process can be truncated if some fraction of water above the azeotropic limit of the fuel (see Table 1) is tolerable, saving a portion of energy during the production process [31]. In addition to the production of biomethanol from biomass derived syngas, methanol can be produced as a synthetic fuel from H2 and CO2 with the input of electricity (also called an e-fuel when renewable electricity is used) [32]. Synthesizing methanol using renewable electricity is not only an energy-dense method to store electricity, but is also a more efficient means of storing hydrogen [29,31]."
5,Biopropanol production,"3.3 Biopropanol production 1-propanol is generally produced via catalytic hydrogenation of propionaldehyde, which itself is produced from ethylene sourced from fossil fuels [33]. Therefore, bio-1-propanol could be produced through biosynthesized ethylene. However, currently, the most economically viable pathway of ethylene biosynthesis is through catalytic conversion of bioethanol [34,35]. Syngas fermentation can coproduce the C2-C4 primary alcohols (ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol) in a mass ratio of 8:6:1 [36]. Metabolic engineering of Propionibacterium freudenreichii has produced strains that produce 1-propanol from glycerol [37], while metabolic engineering of Escherichia Coli bacteria has produced strains that coproduce 1-propanol and 1-butanol in nearly equal quantities from glucose via 2-ketoacid pathways [38]. In essence, this metabolic engineering allows a process, either fermentative or non-fermentative, to primarily produce alcohols other than ethanol from similar feedstocks. Therefore, the same arguments of feedstock generation discussed in Section 3.1 will apply here, and for all metabolically engineered micro-organisms. 2-propanol, the simplest secondary (sec) alcohol, has two main production methods: hydration of propylene and hydrogenation of acetone. Biosynthesis of 2-propanol currently has lower yields than that of other bio-alcohols, since as a secondary alcohol, 2-propanol biosynthesis from micro-organisms uses different chemical pathways than biosynthesis of primary alcohols. However, recent progress in metabolic engineering of E. Coli bacteria has shown promise in achieving high yields [39]. Alternatively, hydrogenation of biosynthesized acetone or coproduction with butanol and ethanol are viable bioproduction methods; for example, the conversion of acetone produced in acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation (ABE, detailed in Section 3.4 ) to isopropanol via metabolic engineering of Clostridium acetobutylicum [40]."
6,Biobutanol production,"3.4 Biobutanol production n-butanol and isobutanol are both primarily produced in large quantities by carbonylation of fossil fuel-sourced propylene. 2-butanol, which is less commonly used, is currently produced by the hydration of fossil fuel-sourced butene. n-butanol was first biosynthesized in the early 1900 s via ABE fermentation of glucose by various strains of the bacteria family Clostridium. The ABE process effectively produces acetone, n-butanol, and ethanol in a 3:6:1 ratio from a variety of feedstocks. However, one of the largest challenges to overcome is the low butanol tolerance of Clostridium. To address this, continuous recovery of butanol during the fermentation process must occur [41]. Non-fermentative processes of biobutanol production exist using metabolically engineering bacteria, such as E. Coli [42,43]. However, using yeast for biobutanol production has practical advantages over using bacteria [44]. As butanol is a natural byproduct of the fermentation of glucose by Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, metabolic engineering can enhance these pathways and suppress ethanol production pathways to biosynthesize n-butanol, isobutanol, and 2-butanol [45]. Although this approach is promising, bacteria can synthesize biobutanol with yields near the theoretical limit, which is not yet true for yeast; therefore, a considerable amount of research is dedicated to increasing the yield of biobutanol from yeast [46,47], including the utilization of xylose [48,49]. Like 2-propanol, 2-butanol is a secondary alcohol, and therefore biosynthesis via micro-organisms requires more metabolic engineering than its primary alcohol counterparts to maximize yields. Progress in both metabolic engineering of bacteria [45] and yeast [50] have yielded promising results in the biosynthesis of 2-butanol."
7,Higher alcohols,"3.5 Higher alcohols Effective biosynthesis of higher alcohols is achieved through a recursive elongation process, where the carbon chain length of a 2-ketoacid, the precursor to alcohol synthesized via the Ehrlich pathway [51,52], is enzymatically increased with each iteration within a metabolically engineered micro-organism [53]. This method has been shown to biosynthesize most higher alcohols, including pentanol and its isomers [38,54,55], and straight chained primary alcohols [56], among others, using bioderived glucose as a feedstock. All of the metabolically engineering microorganisms discussed for the biosynthesis of alcohols are currently at the research stage, having yet to be demonstrated on a large scale. While both the technical and economic hurdles to overcome are significant, progress to this point has been made at an encouragingly high rate. Therefore, it is important for combustion research using a variety of alcohol fuels to continue in parallel, so that when large-scale production is available, there is a use for these biofuels."
8,Alcohol fuel candidates for advanced combustion,
9,C1-C4 alcohols,"4.1 C1-C4 alcohols There are eight C1-C4 alcohols. Of them, seven are liquid at room temperature and are thus viable fuels. Tert-butanol is not liquid at room temperature and will therefore not be considered as a potential fuel for advanced combustion in this work. Going forward, the phrase C1-C4 alcohols refers to other seven alcohols. Since the RON and MON scales are created with respect to primary reference fuels with strong NTC behavior, a high, positive octane sensitivity (RON – MON) implies that a fuel has little-to-no NTC behavior. The C1-C4 alcohols do not exhibit any NTC behavior and with the exception of n-butanol, are single stage ignition fuels, primarily because cool flame reaction pathways essentially require at least a four-carbon chain alkyl group in the molecule [57]. Under high boost conditions, n-butanol displays some cool flame reactivity via ITHR [58]; however, the ignition delay of n-butanol still does not experience an NTC region despite this ITHR [59]. The hydroxyl group of the alcohol acts as a radical chain terminating group following H-abstraction, which inhibits cool flame reactivity [60,61]. This not only supports their lack of NTC behavior, but also results in their ability to suppress the NTC behavior of other fuels. As a result, the C1-C4 alcohols are often used as a blend stock in gasoline to improve anti-knock index (AKI) [62]. The high latent heat of vaporization of the C1-C4 alcohols also serves to both lower knock propensity and increase volumetric efficiency in production engines. Having a fuel bound oxygen on a short-chained hydrocarbon results in a lower energy density, a lower stoichiometric air–fuel ratio (which further increases its cooling potential (Eq. (1))), and a lower sooting potential. The high cooling potential, low sooting potential, and lack of NTC behavior of the C1-C4 alcohols make them good candidates for lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion. In HCCI, the start of combustion of both methanol and ethanol showed little-to-no sensitivity to changes in equivalence ratio and a high sensitivity to changes in intake temperature [63,64]. Methanol has been shown to enable lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion in a heavy-duty engine, with all of the fuel injected during the compression stroke [65,66] while ethanol has been shown to enable lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion in a light-duty engine using a split injection strategy [6,8]. In an HCCI autoignition study with n-butanol and isobutanol, n-butanol showed similar φ- and temperature-sensitivity to gasoline, including ITHR under boosted conditions, whereas isobutanol showed similar φ- and temperature-sensitivity to ethanol [58]. This means that isobutanol is likely a better candidate to enable lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion than n-butanol, and that n-butanol might be better suited for rich-to-lean burn advanced combustion strategies. Another factor to consider for the C1-C4 alcohols is water solubility. All of the C2-C4 alcohols (methanol excluded) form azeotropes during production. Since ethanol and both propanol isomers are completely miscible with fuel, there are potential energy savings during the production of these fuels if some amount of water is tolerable [67]. With lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion, this water in the fuel is actually advantageous [68,69] since the cooling potential of the fuel increases with water content while the φ-sensitivity of the fuel is largely unchanged, an effect explored in the following section. There is a caveat that the fuel will have a lower energy density and that the combustion efficiency can decrease if the water content in the fuel is too high [70]; therefore, a tradeoff exists between increasing the cooling potential of the fuel via water addition and decreasing the energy density/combustion efficiency of the fuel. For the three bio-synthesizable butanol isomers, their miscibility with water is lower than the water content found in their azeotrope – they only form a homogeneous azeotrope up to their miscibility limit, beyond which a heterogeneous azeotrope forms. This means that potential energy savings and cooling potential enhancement with added water content are limited for the pure butanol isomers."
10,C5 + Alcohols,"4.2 C5 + Alcohols Chain branching occurs as the carbon number of an alcohol fuel increases. This results in an exponential increase in the number of isomers that each alcohol fuel has, e.g., octanol (C8) has 89 isomers. As a result, not all of the higher alcohols have well characterized fuel properties. As carbon number increases, the polarization effect of the hydroxyl group on the molecule decreases. As a result, the difference in fuel properties, such as heat of vaporization, between an alcohol and their alkane counterpart decreases as carbon number increases. As the carbon chain increases, the ability of the hydroxyl group to suppress low-temperature alkyl-peroxyl radical isomerization reaction pathways weakens and NTC behavior emerges. This NTC behavior is seen with all of the C5 + alcohols with the exception of some pentanol isomers [71,72]. For example, isopentanol, like n-butanol, shows some ITHR under boosted conditions but not enough to create significant NTC behavior that would result in the φ-sensitivity needed to enable rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion [73]. Although at low boost levels, isopentanol could enable a lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion, its inability to control the heat release process at high boost levels makes isopentanol a poor candidate. For the other higher alcohols, NTC behavior (and with it, φ-sensitivity), increases as carbon number increases. Additionally, the cooling potential of alcohols decrease as carbon number increases, since the effect of the hydroxyl group weakens as the molecule grows. Therefore, higher alcohols become good candidates to enable rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion. However, as indicated by their octane numbers, the autoignition resistance of the higher alcohols decreases significantly as carbon number is increased, which limits the compression ratio, and subsequently the efficiency, of the engine they are fueling."
11,Normalized φ-sensitivity of alcohol fuels,"To determine which fuels are the best candidates to enable either lean-to-rich or rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion, a metric is required that can be used to compare different fuels, like RON and MON do for spark ignition. Lopez-Pintor et al. first proposed normalized φ-sensitivity as a metric to compare the φ-sensitivity of different fuels [9]. Specifically, normalized φ-sensitivity describes how the local ignition delay time changes in response to a change in φ, and is given by Eq. (2): (2) N o r m a l i z e d φ - s e n s i t i v i t y = - 1 τ d τ d φ where the derivative of ignition delay, τ , with respect to φ is normalized by the negative of τ . The minus sign is included so that the normalized φ-sensitivity will be positive in general, since ignition delay tends to decrease with increasing φ. A metric such as normalized φ-sensitivity could be used to quantify the efficacy of stratification to enable control over the heat release process in LTC. As noted by Messerly et al., this definition depends inversely on φ [10]. To amend this, Messerly suggested a new definition of φ-sensitivity that is truly normalized, i.e. unitless, by multiplying Eq. (2) by φ. This definition will be henceforth called the φ-normalized φ-sensitivity: (3) φ - N o r m a l i z e d φ - s e n s i t i v i t y = - φ τ ∂ τ ∂ φ = - ∂ l o g ( τ ) ∂ l o g ( φ ) The work conducted in Ref. [9], which analyzed the φ-sensitivity of fuels using chemical kinetics in a constant volume reactor, accounted for how changes in φ would result in changes in temperature due to the evaporative cooling of a direct injection event. Contrarily, Ref. [10] did not consider the φ-temperature coupling that results from the direct injection of fuel, providing the justification that the fuels studied had a low cooling potential. Without considering evaporative cooling-driven changes in temperature, these metrics are useful to understand how staged the combustion process will proceed in a cylinder that is thermally isotropic but compositionally heterogeneous. If the evaporative cooling-driven changes in temperature are considered, the metric provides a more realistic prediction of the φ-sensitivity of fuels employed in a rich-to-lean burn combustion mode. This is illustrated by the authors choice of the total derivative in Eq. (2) and a partial derivative in Eq. (3). By using a total derivative, which considers temperature as a function of φ created by the injection event, changes in temperature that result from changes in φ are accounted for and are functionally represented by the cooling potential Eq. (Eq. (1)). The coupled relationship between changes in temperature and changes in φ in a combustion chamber that may have a non-zero φ at the time of injection can be expressed by modifying Eq. (1) to produce the following equation: (4) dT d φ = - h fg AFR stoich + φ bg C p where φbg is the background equivalence ratio, i.e. the equivalence ratio of the charge before the compression stroke injection, and cp is now the specific heat of the background fuel–air mixture. Note the minus sign in Eq. (4), since the temperature will decrease from evaporative cooling. Either φ-sensitivity metric (Eq. (2) or Eq. (3)) can be used with either a partial or a total derivative based on if evaporative cooling is to be considered. When evaporative cooling is considered, the total derivative of τ (φ, T(φ)), with respect to φ is: (5) d τ d φ = ∂ τ ∂ φ + ∂ τ ∂ T dT d φ The total derivative is the sum of how the ignition delay changes with φ and how the ignition delay changes with the φ-coupled change in temperature. If d τ d φ is negative, the ignition delay in rich regions will shorten and the charge will burn rich-to-lean. If d τ d φ is positive, the ignition delay in rich regions will lengthen, and the charge will burn lean-to-rich. When Messerly et al. proposed the φ-normalization of Eq. (2) in Ref. [10], a primary motivation was to simplify the analytical solution of Eq. (3) when τ is given as an ignition delay correlation in the Arrhenius form: (6) τ = Ap α φ β χ O 2 γ exp E a ' T where A is the pre-exponential coefficient, p and α are pressure and its exponential coefficient, respectively, φ and β are equivalence ratio and its exponential coefficient, respectively, χ O 2 and γ are the mole fraction of oxygen and its exponential coefficient, respectively, E a ' is the activation energy divided by the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature. If Eq. (3) is then evaluated using Eq. (6), the resulting normalized φ-sensitivity is simply - β , which is in principle a function of temperature and pressure that varies insignificantly over engine relevant conditions near ignition [10], meaning φ-normalized φ-sensitivity is not a function of φ. However, if Eq. (3) is evaluated analytically using the total derivative d τ d φ instead of the partial derivative ∂ τ ∂ T to account for charge cooling, φ-normalized φ-sensitivity is now: (7) φ - N o r m a l i z e d φ - s e n s i t i v i t y = - φ τ d τ d φ = - β + φ E a ' T 2 dT d φ - φ γ χ O 2 d χ O 2 d φ Note that in Eq. (7), the term d χ O 2 d φ considers how χ O 2 changes with changes in φ. There is no analogous pressure term since there is no cylinder pressure gradient induced, i.e., cylinder pressure remains uniform throughout the cylinder. Eq. (7) illustrates that while normalizing φ-sensitivity by φ produces a unitless value, it does not remove the functional dependence of φ-sensitivity on φ. This Eq. also has a term with T−2 dependence, and within the term dT d φ is cp , which is a function of both φ and temperature. Eq. (6) can also be used in Eq. (2) to calculate a normalized φ-sensitivity: (8) N o r m a l i z e d φ - s e n s i t i v i t y = - 1 τ d τ d φ = - β φ + E a ' T 2 dT d φ - γ χ O 2 d χ O 2 d φ Both normalized φ-sensitivity and φ-normalized φ-sensitivity are valuable metrics to evaluate a fuel’s ability to enable a stratified advanced combustion mode. In this work, the authors choose to use the metric normalized φ-sensitivity because this metric can directly provide information on relative changes in ignition delay for a given cylinder condition, expressed as a fractional change. Normalized φ-sensitivity could then instead be multiplied by Δφ, a factor that captures the level of stratification in the cylinder, producing a unitless value that describes how the ignition delay distribution in the combustion chamber changes with the level of stratification described by Δφ, i.e., the standard deviation in φ or a similar metric for the width of the φ distribution. In principle, a fuel with a normalized φ-sensitivity double that of another fuel would require half the amount of stratification to achieve the same level of control over the combustion process with a direct injection of fuel. Ignition delay correlations are ineffective at accurately predicting the ignition delay of multi-stage ignition fuels due to their inability to capture NTC behavior. However, for single stage ignition fuels, autoignition phenomena can be accurately modeled with ignition delay correlations under limited sets of operating conditions [74]. Therefore, while the higher alcohols or any other rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion fuel candidates require chemical kinetics to study their normalized φ-sensitivity behavior, the normalized φ-sensitivity behavior of the lower alcohols can be studied using ignition delay correlations, provided these ignition delay correlations are developed under engine relevant operating conditions. Ignition delay correlations are generally computed from datasets collected either on a rapid compression machine (RCM) or a shock-tube. When selecting an ignition delay correlation to study the normalized φ-sensitivity behavior of a fuel, it is important that the ignition delay correlation in question was developed under engine relevant conditions. Considering next-generation LTC engines will have medium-to-high compression ratios, this means that the ignition delay correlation should be developed under high pressure and intermediate temperature conditions. Additionally, they should be developed with a dataset that includes multiple equivalence ratio points. It has been noted that the ignition delay predictions of RCMs and shock-tubes differ significantly below 1100 K due to increasing error in shock-tube measurements [75]. For this reason, only ignition delay correlations developed on an RCM should be considered for this study of the normalized φ-sensitivity behavior of a fuel. Considering the form of Eq. (8), each term is linearly dependent on one ignition delay correlation parameter. Since the relative uncertainty of the ignition delay parameters considered are on the order of 5% or lower, it follows that the relative uncertainty of the normalized φ-sensitivity would be of the same magnitude, which does not significantly impact the following analysis. Only three of the seven C1-C4 alcohols have an RCM-developed ignition delay correlation: methanol [76], ethanol [77], and n-butanol [59]. The normalized φ-sensitivity, evaluated using Eq. (8), is mapped to the φ-T plane for methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol in Fig. 3 , Fig. 4 , and Fig. 5 , respectively. In this map, φ can be considered the background φ in the cylinder, or in other words, the lowest φ in the cylinder, since changes in the ignition delay are referenced to this background φ when quantifying the ignition delay distribution in the cylinder. Because the ignition delay correlations report β , E a ' , and γ as constant values rather than functions of operating conditions, the maps developed are independent of in-cylinder pressure. Values of β , E a ' , and γ are displayed in Table 2 . For a number of the advanced combustion concepts, stratification is used to control the combustion process outside of the operating range of HCCI. With that said, low-temperature, high-φ regions that correspond to loads too high for HCCI combustion without engine-damaging energy release rates are of interest. The temperature and φ of the high load regions will depend on two factors: the intake boost level and the required level of stratification to protect the engine from high energy release rates. It is desirable for a fuel to have a large absolute value of normalized φ-sensitivity in the high load regime so that only small amounts of stratification need to be induced to control the combustion process, reducing the likelihood of generating rich and near-stoichiometric regions in the cylinder that could produce harmful emissions. From Fig. 3, it can be seen that methanol has highly negative values of normalized φ-sensitivity for operating conditions that would correspond to high loads. This makes methanol an ideal fuel candidate to enable lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion. With a normalized φ-sensitivity less than −4, the ignition delay of rich regions will double compared to the ignition delay of lean regions for a change in φ of less than 0.25. The need to induce as little stratification as possible to control the heat release process is not only beneficial for minimizing harmful emissions but is also beneficial for efficiency. There is a potential efficiency detriment from injecting a large quantity of a fuel whose latent heat of vaporization is a non-negligible fraction of its lower heating value during the closed portion of the cycle (e.g., for methanol, hfg /QLHV ~ 6%). Additionally, minimizing the required stratification is important when exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is used, since EGR lowers the oxygen content in the cylinder. Examining Fig. 5, n-butanol has, in the high load regime, normalized φ-sensitivity values that trend towards zero, implying it would be ineffective at preventing damaging energy release rates and extending the high load limit since stratifying the charge with n-butanol would not significantly impact the ignition delay distribution in the cylinder. This result is not completely unexpected since there is evidence of ITHR from n-butanol under boosted engine conditions and this ITHR works against the high cooling potential of the fuel [58]. Although when developing the ignition delay correlation of n-butanol, no cool flame reactivity was noted, the low activation energy of n-butanol compared to methanol and ethanol implies that there may be some non-single stage ignition behavior [59]. More evidence supporting n-butanol’s ITHR is found in work comparing the C1-C4 primary alcohols in high temperature shock-tube experiments and simulations. There, the activation energy of n-butanol was found to be close to that of ethanol and larger than methanol [78], meaning the large difference in activation energy seen in the RCM and the shock tube is likely due to ITHR in the high pressure, intermediate-temperature regime. Overall, n-butanol does not seem to be an ideal fuel candidate to enable either lean-to-rich or rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion on its own. However, the neutral contribution of n-butanol stratification to the ignition delay distribution implies it could serve as a blending additive to increase the biofuel content of a fuel blend for use in either lean-to-rich or rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion. Considering the normalized φ-sensitivity of n-butanol, and the autoignition behavior of n-pentanol and n-hexanol compared to n-butanol [72], which show more cool flame reactivity that n-butanol, it is likely n-pentanol or n-hexanol will be good fuel candidates to enable rich-to-lean burn combustion, perhaps blended with some higher octane fuel to increase their autoignition resistance without impacting their cool flame reactivity to allow for high compression ratio operation. In Fig. 4, it can be seen that the normalized φ-sensitivity of ethanol has a low absolute value for the entirety of the φ-T map. In the high-load regime, ethanol’s normalized φ-sensitivity is only slightly negative, meaning it can enable lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion, but not very effectively. This was confirmed in experiments that used a split injection of neat ethanol to smoot heat release rates [6]. Since methanol and ethanol have very similar autoignition properties, the biggest factor resulting in differences in their respective normalized φ-sensitivities is their cooling potential. One way to increase the cooling potential of ethanol is through the addition of water to the fuel. As mentioned earlier, this is dually advantageous, as it reduces the energy requirement during the production of ethanol in addition to increasing its cooling potential. Fig. 6 displays the cooling potential ( dT d φ ) of wet ethanol vs. the mass percentage of water in the wet ethanol blend. The cooling potential of wet ethanol with a composition of 76% ethanol, 24% water by mass (WE76) is equal to that of neat methanol. Fig. 7 maps the normalized φ-sensitivity of WE76 to the φ-T plane. WE76 has negative values of normalized φ-sensitivity comparable to methanol (Fig. 3) in the high load region, meaning wet ethanol blends near WE76 are also ideal fuel candidates to enable lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion. HCCI combustion with various wet ethanol blends showed that combustion did not deteriorate and CO/uHC emissions did not significantly increase with water addition below 35% by mass (WE65) [70]. There will be a balance between how much water is in the water-fuel mixture and how much φ-stratification must be induced to control the combustion process. Since methanol is miscible with water, blends of wet methanol could also be used to increase the efficacy of the fuel in lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion. However, this is unlikely since neat methanol alone shows the potential for effectively enabling lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion, and any further addition of water would only serve to lower the already low energy density of the fuel and possibly produce more harmful emissions. Without an ignition delay correlation derived from RCM data, it is not possible to generate a normalized φ-sensitivity map for n-propanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, and 2-butanol. However, some conclusions can be drawn about these four low alcohol fuels by comparing their reactivities from data found in the literature. Since all of those fuels do not display NTC behavior, they are candidates for lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion. The autoignition of methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol was compared in shock-tube experiments [78]. Although the lowest temperature tested was ~ 1050 K, it was clear that ethanol and n-propanol had very similar autoignition behavior. A comparative shock-tube study of n-propanol and isopropanol showed that isopropanol had a higher activation energy than n-propanol, though both had similar φ-sensitivities [79]. This agrees with the MON ratings of the fuels, with methanol, ethanol, and n-propanol having nearly identical MON ratings and isopropanol having a higher MON rating. The same can be said about RON if the RON rating is modified to account for the high cooling potential of the fuels in question [80,81]. If n-propanol has similar ignition delay behavior at lower temperature, higher pressure conditions than those studied in Ref. [78], and if isopropanol has a slightly higher activation energy than n-propanol, it can be concluded that isopropanol will be a better candidate fuel than n-propanol. However, neither fuels in their neat form will be great candidates, since they will have a lower cooling potential than ethanol, which in its neat form (Fig. 4) is not a great candidate. Fortunately, like ethanol, both propanol isomers are miscible with water, and therefore, their cooling potentials can be increased, as shown in Fig. 6. Above water mass percentages of ~ 15% (WP85), both propanol isomers have a higher cooling potential than neat ethanol and at ~ 33% (WP67), the cooling potential of both propanol isomers equals that of neat methanol. To date, there have been no studies on the water tolerability of the propanol isomers in LTC. In HCCI combustion, isobutanol was shown to behave similarly to ethanol [58]. This is supported by their similar MON and modified RON ratings. All four butanol isomers were studied in an RCM, though no ignition delay correlation was developed [82]. However, it is clear that isobutanol and 2-butanol have very similar ignition delay behavior, with isobutanol being slightly less reactive at higher pressures. With both butanol isomers having a much lower cooling potential than methanol, they will likely struggle to enable lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion. Further compounding this is their limited miscibility with water, which limits a potential increase in their cooling potential via water addition. From the previous analysis, the C1-C4 alcohol fuels’ propensities to enable a lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion can be ranked as follows: methanol ≈ wet ethanol > wet isopropanol > wet n-propanol > ethanol > isopropanol > n-propanol > isobutanol ≈ 2-butanol > n-butanol. To incorporate the less effective C1-C4 alcohol fuels, multi-component alcohol fuel blends can be developed. For example, an ethanol/isobutanol/water blend of 50%/25%/25%, by mass, will have nearly the same cooling potential as methanol. Using multi-component alcohol fuel blends can increase the utilization of biofuels in stratified LTC. In the previous example, ethanol is able to serve as a cosolvent to isobutanol and water, allowing for the use of isobutanol in stratified LTC. For rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion, higher alcohols must be used. Choosing a higher alcohol for rich-to-lean combustion requires a balance between the strength of the NTC behavior and the low autoignition resistance of the fuel. Based on autoignition studies, NTC behavior becomes significant in higher alcohols with at least a five-carbon-long straight chain in the molecule. Alcohols with more than six carbons tend to have autoignition resistance that is too low. Therefore, n-pentanol, n-hexanol, and some hexanol isomers are the best alcohol fuel candidates to enable rich-to-lean stratified combustion. One final factor to consider that was not mentioned above is the influence of natural thermal stratification on the heat release process of a stratified LTC mode. Since both rich-to-lean and lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion aim to control the distribution of ignition delay times in the combustion chamber through a direct injection event, the distribution of ignition delay times prior to the direct injection event should also be considered. For example, in lean-to-rich stratified combustion, regions targeted by the spray will experience an increase in their local ignition delay time. Therefore, it is advantageous to target the spray to regions in the cylinder that have a longer ignition delay time due to natural thermal stratification. Otherwise, the spray may result in a more homogenous distribution of ignition delay times in the combustion chamber. In other words, the stratification process used to control the heat release process should work with natural thermal stratification. Although it is possible to overpower natural thermal stratification with the direct injection event, it is a more efficient use of stratification to work with the natural thermal stratification if possible, which can help minimize the risk of producing harmful emissions. Prior experimental and computational fluid dynamics results have confirmed the importance of injector spray angle on stratified combustion modes [83,84]."
12,Conclusion,"The production methods of alcohol fuels from bio-derived feedstock are rapidly evolving. Determining the ideal advanced combustion mode for these alcohol fuels is therefore paramount. Next generation stratified LTC modes that aim to control the heat release process through a compression stroke injection of fuel can be divided into two groups based on how the heat release process proceeds in the stratified combustion chamber: lean-to-rich burn or rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion. In this work, the potential of a variety of alcohol fuels to effectively enable either lean-to-rich or rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion is analyzed by considering the fuel’s normalized φ-sensitivity, a metric that describes how the local ignition delay time changes in response to a change in φ from a direct injection of fuel, along with the corresponding coupled changes in temperature and local composition that the direct injection spray induces. The following conclusions can be drawn from this analysis: 1. C1-C4 alcohols have a high cooling potential and lack NTC behavior, making them ideal fuel candidates to enable lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion 2. With the exception of n-butanol, the reactivity of the C1-C4 alcohols are similar. Therefore, the most important factor determining the efficacy of the fuel to enable lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion is their cooling potential, specifically their latent heat of vaporization and stoichiometric air–fuel ratio. 3. An effective method to increase the cooling potential of a fuel is by blending the fuel with water. The C1-C3 alcohols are completely miscible water, meaning the water-alcohol blend ratio is only limited by potential combustion/emission considerations. The butanols have limited miscibility with water. However, a water-butanol blend can be produced using a C1-C3 alcohol as a cosolvent. 4. Ranking the efficacy of the C1-C4 alcohols to enable lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion: methanol ≈ wet ethanol > wet isopropanol > wet n-propanol > ethanol > isopropanol > n-propanol > isobutanol ≈ 2-butanol > n-butanol. 5. With the exception of some pentanol isomers, C5 + alcohols show NTC behavior and a cooling potential close to its corresponding alkane, meaning they are good candidates to enable rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion. 6. n-pentanol, n-hexanol, and some hexanol isomers are the best fuel candidates to enable rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion since they have a good balance of normalized φ-sensitivity and autoignition resistance."
