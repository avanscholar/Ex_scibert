0,Introduction,"The oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes and ketones is one of the most important and fundamental reactions in organic chemistry. Recently, oxidant-free or acceptor-free oxidation based on the transition-metal catalyzed dehydrogenative transformation of alcohols accompanied by the evolution of hydrogen gas (acceptorless dehydrogenation) has attracted considerable attention from the standpoint of atom economy and environmental concerns [1–4]. Furthermore, acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols is important not only for the production of synthetically useful aldehydes and ketones from easily available alcohols with high atom efficiency [5–11], but also for the production of hydrogen which is one of the most promising energy carriers in future energy plans [12–15]. Thus, much effort has been devoted to develop various homogeneous catalytic systems for the acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols affording ketones and aldehydes. We have previously reported several systems for acceptorless oxidation of alcohols catalysed by iridium complexes bearing functional 2-hydroxypyridine- and 2,2′-dihydroxybipyridine-based ligands (complexes A, B, and C, D), as shown in Fig. 1 [16–20], [21]. Since these catalytic systems would proceed by the activation of an alcohol with the 2-pyridonate ligand by way of either the stepwise pathway through β-hydrogen elimination of an alkoxoiridium intermediate [16] or the concreted pathway through cyclic transition state [20,22], the intramolecular reaction of hydride on iridium with protic hydrogen on the 2-hydroxypyridine-based ligand (ligand-promoted dehydrogenation) could be a critical step (Scheme 1 ). Thus, the 2-pyridonate ligand could act as a proton acceptor in the activation step [23] and as a proton donor in the dehydrogenation step [24,25], playing a dual role in the cooperative catalysis. Therefore, it should be indispensable to investigate the substituent effect of the 2-pyridonate ligand on the catalytic performance in order to develop the more effective catalyst. We report here the synthesis of a series of iridium complexes bearing substituted 2-pyridonates and their catalytic performance of acceptorless oxidation of alcohols."

9,Results and discussion,
10,Synthesis of iridium complexes bearing substituted 2-pyridonates,"3.1 Synthesis of iridium complexes bearing substituted 2-pyridonates We started to synthesize iridium complexes bearing various 5-susbstituted 2-pyridonates, because it is considered that the 5-position (para-position to the hydroxyl group) must be the most influential position for the electronic effect of the 2-pyridonate ligand. Since it is expected that an electron withdrawing group (EWG) could increase the basicity of the 2-pyridonate ligand as the proton acceptor in the activation step as well as the acidity of the 2-hydroxyl group as the proton donor in the dehydrogenation step, we have introduced several electron-withdrawing groups at the 5-position. In addition, methyl group is introduced to the 4-position (para-position to the nitrogen atom) as the electron-donating group (EDG) in order to increase coordination ability of the ligand to iridium center (Fig. 3 ). The synthetic route is depicted in eq. (1). Treatment of a variety of substituted 2-hydroxylpyridines (1) with sodium ethoxide gave sodium salts, which then reacted with [Cp*IrCl2]2 (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) to give the corresponding various Cp*Ir 2-pyridonate complexes (2) in 29–75% yields after recrystallization. (1) Image 2 The structures of the complexes were determined by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analyses and those of complexes 2ad, 2bc, and 2bf were further confirmed by X-ray analyses (Fig. 2). The bond parameters are summarized in Table 2. Bond lengths of Ir-N in complexes 2ad, 2bc, and 2bf were 2.130(4), 2.098(6), 2.119(4) Å, respectively. Bond lengths of Ir-O in complexes 2ad, 2bc, and 2bf were 2.198(4), 2.216(5), 2.192(4) Å, respectively. Bond lengths of Ir-N and Ir-O in complexes 2ad and 2bf were close to the corresponding bond lengths in complex 2aa [Ir-N: 2.118(4) Å; Ir-O: 2.181(4) Å] [16]. On the other hand, the bond length of Ir-N in complex 2bc was slightly shorter than that in complex 2aa, while Ir-O in 2bc was much longer than that in 2aa, indicating stronger coordination of the pyridonate ligand in 2bc."
11,Acceptorless dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethnol catalyzed by various Cp*Ir 2-pyridonate complexes,"3.2 Acceptorless dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethnol catalyzed by various Cp*Ir 2-pyridonate complexes We next examined acceptorless dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol catalyzed by a series of Cp*Ir 2-pyridonate complexes (2aa-2bf) as a benchmark test to compare their catalytic performance. The reactions were conducted by using 0.1 mol% of the complexes in toluene at reflux temperature for 20 h. The results are shown in Table 3. Electron-withdrawing groups such as 5-trifluoromethyl and 5-methoxylcarobonyl groups increased the yields of acetophenone (entries 3 and 4), whereas introduction of electron-donating methyl group at the 5-position significantly retarded the reaction (entry 2). Furthermore, it is apparent that introduction of methyl group at the 4-position clearly improved the catalytic performance to give acetophenone in excellent yields (entries 3, 4, and 5 vs. entries 7, 8, and 9). These results indicate that the prediction mentioned above is valid for consideration of the catalytic performance of Cp*Ir(2-pyiridonate)Cl complexes. In order to precisely compare the catalytic activities of complexes 2ac, 2bc, 2bd, and 2be, the reactions using a smaller amount of the catalyst (0.05 mol%) were carried out. The results are summarized in Table 4. It is obvious that complex 2bc demonstrates the highest catalytic performance among the complexes examined, and TON reached up to 1660 in 20 h (entry 2). It should be added that acceptorless dehydrogenation of an aliphatic secondary alcohol can also be effectively catalyzed by complex 2bc. Thus, the reaction of 2-octanol was conducted by using 0.2 mol% of 2bc under reflux in toluene for 20 h to give 2-octanone in 91% yield (equation (2)). (2) Image 5"
12,Acceptorless dehydrogenation of primary alcohols catalyzed by 2bc,"3.3 Acceptorless dehydrogenation of primary alcohols catalyzed by 2bc We have next examined the reactions of various primary alcohols by using highly active catalyst 2bc, because acceptorless dehydrogenations of primary alcohols are generally more difficult than those of secondary alcohols. The results are shown in Table 5. While the reactions of benzylic alcohols carried out by using 2.0 mol% of 2bc in refluxing toluene to give the corresponding benzaldehydes in moderate to high yields (entries 1–4), the reactions of aliphatic primary alcohols gave lower yields of aliphatic aldehydes (entries 5 and 6). These results indicate that the catalytic performance of 2bc is higher than that of catalysts A and B bearing 2-hydroxypyridine-based ligands, because A did not exhibit high activity [16] for the dehydrogenation of primary alcohols and B showed high activity only under basic conditions [17]."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, we have synthesized a series of Cp*Ir complexes bearing 5-substituted 2-pyridonate ligands and compared their catalytic performance for acceptorless dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol. Among various electron-withdrawing groups such as trifluoromethyl, methoxycarbonyl, cyano, and, nitro groups, Cp*Ir complex 2ac bearing 5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridonate ligand exhibited the higher catalytic activity. Furthermore, we have disclosed that introduction of methyl group at the 4-position in pyridonate ligand improved the catalytic performance. Thus, Cp*Ir complex 2bc bearing 4-methyl-5-trifuloromethyl-2-pyridonate ligand gave the best result. Furthermore, complex 2bc demonstrated good catalytic activity for acceptorless dehydrogenation of primary alcohols. These results may provide the valuable information for designing functional 2-hydroxypyridine-based ligands in organometallic catalysts of acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols under mild conditions."
