0,Introduction,"N-butyl acetate is a frequently-used intermediate and raw material applied in chemical, pharmaceutical and other fields [1–3]. However, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) has made headway in the market of the catalyst used during the traditional production of n-butyl acetate, which leads to its poor selectivity as well as serious equipment corrosion and environmental pollution with by-products [4]. Therefore, developing an efficient and green catalyst to replace the H2SO4 makes it fundamentally conducive to meet the increasing demand of n-butyl acetate as well as achieving the sustainable economy. As a Keggin-type heteropolyacid, phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40) has been recognized as multifunctional catalyst due to its stronger acidity, better chemical stability and catalytic selectivity [5–7]. Nevertheless, the practical application of H3PW12O40 as solid catalyst was obstructed by the low specific surface areas (<5 m2 g−1), soluble in polar solvents, and difficulties in recovery [8]. Altering the protons with transition metal ions in H3PW12O40 is a useful strategy to effectively modulate various physicochemical properties including surface area, morphological properties and catalytic performance [9]. In this work, a series of Snx/4H3-xPW12O40 (x = 1, 2, 3) were prepared from SnCl4 and H3PW12O40 via a simple method. The optimal condition including the mass fraction of catalyst, the mole ratio of n-butanol to acetic acid, the reaction temperature and time are discussed in detail. Our results reveal that Sn substitution of protons can effectively improve the esterification yield of the n-butyl acetate."
1,Experimental section,"All the chemicals were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and used without purification. In a typical synthesis, 2.88 g (1 mmol) of phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40, 99.9%) was added in 40 mL distilled water with stirring until completely dissolved. A proper amount of tin tetrachloride (SnCl4, 99.9%) was then added into above solution and magnetically stirred at 80 °C on a heating plate until nearly evaporated. The resultant was placed in an oven at 120 °C for 3 h to obtain the white Keggin-type Snx/4H3-xPW12O40 (x = 1, 2, 3). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Focus D8 Advance (Bruker, Germany) equipped with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15064 nm). The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum was recorded on a Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (Bruker, Germany). The surface areas and pore size distributions were recorded by nitrogen adsorption at −196 °C on a TriStar 3000 Analyzer (Micromeritics, USA). The morphologies were observed by COXEM scanning electron microscope (SEM, YUZHONG, China) with THERMO spectroscopy analyzer (Idax, USA). The esterification reaction was conducted as followed: 5.8 mL glacial acetic acid and 18.4 mL n-butanol were mixed in a 100 mL round bottom flask. After stirring for 5 mins, 0.2 g catalyst (Snx/4H3-xPW12O40) was dispersed into the above transparent solution, subsequently installing the oil–water separator. The mixture was heated at 120 °C with magnetic stirring for 2.5 h to obtain n-butyl acetate. The esterification yield was evaluated by titration method with NaOH as titrant, and calculated according to the following formula: Esterificaitonyield = 1 - A a A b × 100 % = 1 - V a V b × 100 % in which Aa and Ab is the acid content of mixture after and before esterification reaction, Va and Vb (mL) is the volume of the NaOH solution consumed after and before esterification reaction."
2,Results and discussion,"The XRD patterns of Snx/4H3-xPW12O40 at the range from 10 to 80 are presented in Fig. 1 a. All reflections are indexed with the single Keggin-type H3PW12O40 (PDF # 50-0657) with space group Pn-3 m [10]. Slight differences exist in peaks intensities and positions with increasing Sn addition, confirming that the Sn has been effectually incorporated into the H3PW12O40 [11]. In terms of FT-IR spectra of samples shown in Fig. 1b, the peaks around 1079 cm−1 (P − Oa), 985 cm−1 (W = Ob), 890 cm−1 (W − Ob − W) and 807 cm−1 (W − Oc − W) in all curves of Snx/4H3-xPW12O40 are assigned to the Keggin structure character peaks, indicating that Sn ions fails to enter the inner boundary of the heteropoly anion [12]. Fig. 1c displays the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, all samples exhibit as type IV curve according to IUPAC classification with type H4 hysteresis loop, implying the existence of mesopores. The specific surface area (tabulated in Table 1 ) of Sn1/2HPW12O40 obtained from Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method is 13.08 m2 g−1, which is far higher than that of other samples. All pore-size distribution curves (Fig. 1d) appear a wide peak around 7 nm, confirming the mesoporous structure. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images and EDS spectra of Snx/4H3-xPW12O40. All samples display bulk morphology with diameter around 2–5 μm. The smooth surface of H3PW12O40 is roughened after Sn modification with more porous structure, which echoed with the pore distribution results. In EDS spectra, the elemental peaks of P, W, O and Sn are observed after Sn modification, suggesting a success of preparing Snx/4H3-xPW12O40 with Keggin structure. Conversely, the peak of H is not detected owing to its small relative atomic mass. Given the influence of H, the W/P atomic molar ratios are about 12 in Snx/4H3-xPW12O40, which further indicated that all samples maintained the Keggin structure. All esterification yields of Snx/4H3-xPW12O40 with different parameters are shown in Fig. 3 . In terms of Sn modification levels, 0.2 g Sn1/2HPW12O40 reaches the highest esterification yield (82.8%) of n-butyl acetate among all samples, which was performed at 125 °C for 2.5 h with n(n-butyl alcohol):n(acetic acid) = 2:1. This is presumably attributed to the large specific surface area of Sn1/2HPW12O40, which provides more active centers for catalytic reaction. Subsequently, Sn1/2HPW12O40 was selected as the catalyst for following experiments. The effect of Sn1/2HPW12O40 dosage on the esterification yield is displayed in Fig. 3b. The esterification yield increased abruptly with the increase dosage of Sn1/2HPW12O40, reaching 84.5% at 0.1 g (0.48 wt%) and decreasing gradually beyond it. Such improvement of esterification yield is mainly assigned to the appropriate increment of acid centers, while the excessive acid from more Sn1/2HPW12O40 impedes the esterification reaction conversely. Fig. 3c and d illustrates the results of reaction temperature and time. 130 °C is noted to be the optimum temperature for the reaction, at which esterification yield reached 96.2%. The increase in yield from 115 to 130 °C is explained by the heat-absorbing and reversible reaction, thus the temperature increase favors the reaction in producing the n-butyl acetate. The esterification yield controlled by reaction time responses similarly to that of temperature, the highest of which was achieved at 2.5 h. On the other hand, the yield drop appeared after 130 °C and 2.5 h is owing to the increment of by-products and decomposition of n-butyl acetate at high temperature for long reaction time. Fig. 3e shows the molar ratio of n-butyl alcohol to acetic acid results. Due to the reversible esterification reaction, the increase of n-butyl alcohol, which is water-bearing agent, is conducive to the reaction moving towards the positive direction, resulting in increment of esterification yield. When the molar ratio over 2, the decrement of acid center obstructs the collision between n-butyl alcohol and acetic acid, thus inducing residence reaction rate and esterification yield decrease. As a result, the optimal conditions for the production of n-butyl acetate from n-butyl alcohol and acetic acid catalyzed by Sn1/2HPW12O40 were listed as 0.48 wt% catalyst, 130 °C of reaction temperature, 2.5 h of reaction time and 2 of the molar ratio of n-butyl alcohol to acetic acid. Under these optimized conditions, the esterification yields were 96.2%, 93.7%, 90.4, 88.7% and 86.3% from first to fifth trial, indicating its good reusability. As its duration of use increased, more carbon was deposited on the catalyst surface, causing that acid catalytic centers were covered and esterification yield decreased. The regeneration and structural stability of Sn1/2HPW12O40 after esterification are discussed in Supplementary material (Figs. S1 and S2). Moreover, the esterification reaction of H3PW12O40 and SnCl4 were performed under the optimized conditions to fully investigate the catalytic enhancement of Sn1/2HPW12O40. The substitution of the protons in H3PW12O40 by Sn not only decreased the Brőnsted acid centers, but also increased the Lewis acid centers, thus effectively modulating the acid center type and acid intensity. The synergistic effect originated from Brőnsted and Lewis acid centers in Sn1/2HPW12O40 benefits the esterification reaction. A suitable acid intensity and larger specific surface area are also deemed to be the favorable factors in improving the esterification yield. Thereby, Sn1/2HPW12O40 is a new green and effective catalyst for esterification."
3,Conclusions,"In summary, we have successfully prepared a series of Snx/4H3-xPW12O40 with Keggin structure. Introducing Sn into the H sublattice displays satisfactory in increasing specific surface area and induces a suitable acid intensity. More intriguingly, moderate Brőnsted and Lewis acid centers in Sn1/2HPW12O40 assume positive feedback on the esterification reaction. These modifications lead to significant enhancement in esterification yield of Sn1/2HPW12O40, which has the highest value (96.2%) with 86.3% retention after 5 times. These superior results highlight the applicability of Sn1/2HPW12O40 as green catalyst for producing n-butyl acetate compared with conditional catalyst."
