0,Introduction,"Biodiesel is an alternative fuel composed of mono-alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids from vegetable oils or animal fats, such as rapeseed oil, sunflower oil and animal tallow. The conversion of the above oils and/or fats to esters is usually achieved through catalytic transesterification in the presence of a lower alcohol like methanol or ethanol (EN 14214, 2008). Homogeneous catalytic transesterification can be performed either under alkaline or acidic conditions. In the first case, alkaline metal hydroxides, or alkoxides, like KOH or NaOH and CH3ONa or CH3OK (Georgogianni et al., 2007; Kulkarni and Dalai, 2006; Mendow et al., 2011) are used. In the acid catalyzed transesterification usually H2SO4 or HCl are employed (Wang et al., 2006). On the other hand, heterogeneous catalytic transesterification is based on solid catalysts. In most cases of basic heterogeneous transesterification, alkaline metal oxides like BaO, CaO, MgO and SrO (Georgogianni et al., 2009; Granados et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2007), or hydrotalcite materials (Cantrell et al., 2005; Georgogianni et al., 2009) are used. In the acidic heterogeneous transesterification reaction, acidic oxide catalysts are employed with the most investigated case being ZrO2 (Jitputti et al., 2006). There is a constant research effort for replacing homogeneous catalytic transesterification with heterogeneous transesterification due to the advantages of solid catalysts because of their reusability, the limited formation of soap byproducts and the simpler separation of the final useful esters. In this study MgO oxides were prepared via precipitation method in the absence, or presence, of Poly-Vinyl-Alcohol (PVA) and used as solid catalysts for the transesterification of rapeseed oil with methanol for the production of biodiesel in a reflux batch stirred reactor. The role of PVA in enhancing the catalytic activity of the prepared solids proved quite impressive and this phenomenon is the subject of the present article. It is mentioned that MgO has been employed by various groups as a basic component supported on high surface area inactive substrates like MCM (Georgogianni et al., 2009) and SBA (Li and Rudolph, 2008) solids, as well as an active component added to KOH and NaOH based catalysts (Ilgen and Akin, 2009; Manríquez-Ramírez et al., 2013; Mutreja et al., 2011; Tantirungrotechai et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2010a), while in a few cases MgO itself has been used as heterogeneous catalyst (Wen et al., 2010b). A comparison of the activity of MgO containing transesterification catalysts in the literature to those of the present study is one of the main contributions of this work."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Methanol (>95%) was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt-Germany). Rapeseed oil (0.37% acid value), extracted by mechanical pressure, was provided by the Agricultural Experimental Station of the Technological Educational Institute of Epirus in Arta, Greece. For the catalysts synthesis, Mg(NO)3∙6H2O and PVA (MW = 30.000–70.000) were purchased from Aldrich and 25% NH3 solution from Scharlau."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation The catalysts were synthesized in the presence, or absence, of PVA (Guo et al., 2004). Briefly, appropriate mass of Mg(NO3)2∙6H2O was dissolved in distilled H2O to achieve 0.5 M solution and PVA was added at a molar ratio Mg/PVA = 1/5. Then, 25% w/w NH3 solution was added under stirring until pH = 10, at room temperature. The resulting gel was stirred for 3 h, aged at room temperature overnight, evaporated at 120 °C for 10 h and calcined in air at 400, 600 and 900 °C for 8 h. These samples will be mentioned in the next as MgO-PVA-T where PVA signifies the use of organic polymer and T corresponds to the final calcination temperature. For comparison purposes the same process was repeated without PVA. The catalysts were calcined at the same temperatures. The latter samples will be denoted as MgO-T. The prepared samples along with some of their properties are given in Table 1 ."
4,Catalysts characterization,"2.3 Catalysts characterization 2.3.1 X-ray powder diffraction XRD patterns were obtained using a D8 Advance Brüker diffractometer operating with CuKα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation and a secondary beam graphite monochromator. Powdered samples were scanned over an angular 2θ range from 10 to 90°, in steps of 0.02° (2θ) with a rate of 2 s/step. 2.3.2 Thermogravimetric analysis TG analysis was performed in a Netzsch STA 449C system using a heating rate of 15 K/min in the temperature range of 50–1000 °C. 2.3.3 Nitrogen adsorption–desorption porosimetry N2 adsorption-desorption porosimetry (77 K) was carried out in a Sorptomatic 1990 Fisons porosimeter. Prior to each measurement the sample was degassed overnight at 200 °C and P = 10−2 Torr. 2.3.4 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy The FTIR spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum BX in wavelength range 400–4000 cm−1. Before recording the spectra, the magnesium oxides were mixed with KBr. 2.3.5 Scanning electron microscopy The morphology of the solids was observed in a Jeol JSM 5600 system operating at 20 kV."
5,Transesterification of rapeseed oil,"2.4 Transesterification of rapeseed oil Prior to each transesterification experiment, the magnesium oxide catalysts were pretreated at their calcination temperature 400, 600, 900 °C for 30 min. The biodiesel production took place in a batch reflux reactor where 10 g of unrefined rapeseed oil was mixed with 5% wt (0.5 g) of catalyst, followed by mixing with methanol, as reactant and solvent, in a molar ratio MeOH:Oil = 20:1. In the mixture, 10 ml of n-hexane was also added as co-solvent, proven to facilitate biodiesel production (Kim et al., 2004; Lam et al., 2010). The mixture was refluxed in a 100 ml two-necked-glass-reactor equipped with a water condenser. The reactor was immersed in a thermostated bath filled with glycerol, the temperature of which was controlled by a proportional integral derivative (PID) temperature controller. The temperature was raised to 70 °C and the mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer (1200 rpm) for up to 8 h. Then the reaction mixture was centrifuged (8000 rpm, 4 °C) in order to separate the catalyst. The methanol and hexane were evaporated in a flash evaporator and the final mixture was placed into a separation funnel to separate glycerol from the ester mixture. Methyl ester content was analyzed by gas chromatography, according to previous publications by Koutsouki et al. (2015, 2016)."
6,Biodiesel sampling and analysis,"2.5 Biodiesel sampling and analysis Samples of 2 ml were removed from the reaction mixture every 2 h. After filtration of the catalyst and evaporation of methanol and hexane, the mixture was placed into a separatory funnel and the resulting upper phase was analyzed by gas chromatography. The composition and quantity of methyl esters (biodiesel) was determined according to the following method 20:100 mg of the liquid sample and 1 ml of methyl heptadecanoate solution (10 mg/ml), used as an internal standard, were placed in a 10 ml glass vial and diluted with hexane. 1 μl of the solution was analyzed using an Agilent 6820 Series Gas Chromatograph System equipped with a split/splitless injection system, a flame ionization detector (FID) and an Agilent Select biodiesel for FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters) capillary column with helium as the carrier gas and a split ratio of 35:1. The injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 250 °C. The oven temperature was set at 180 °C for 5 min, and then increased to 250 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min and held at this temperature for 10 min. The free fatty acid content of the rapeseed oil was measured following International and European Standards (ISO5509, 2000). Its acid content value was determined to be 0.37% w/w, which is less than 1% being the highest permitted limit. When the acid value is higher than 1%, the basic sites of the alkaline catalyst can be poisoned due to the absorption of the FFA (Free Fatty Acids) on the surface of the catalyst (Kouzu et al., 2008)."
7,Results,
8,X-ray powder diffraction,"3.1 X-ray powder diffraction The X-ray diffraction patterns of the MgO-PVA-T and MgO-T samples are shown in Fig. 1 . It is observed that only the characteristic peaks of MgO at 2θ ≈ 36, 43, 62, 74 and 78°, according to the ICCD Database, appeared in all samples. Using the Scherrer’s relationship, the crystallite size Dcrystallite was determined and included in Table 1. As seen there, the crystallinity was higher in the samples synthesized in the absence of PVA (MgO-T) as well as in those synthesized in presence of PVA and calcined at 900 °C (MgO-PVA-900). The oxides MgO-PVA-400 and MgO-PVA-600 exhibited less crystallized magnesium oxide phase. The latter solids exhibited the smaller crystallite size, equal to 9 and 17 nm respectively, whereas the rest of the samples contained larger crystallites in the range of 20–34 nm."
9,Thermogravimetric analysis,"3.2 Thermogravimetric analysis Thermal analysis up to 1000 °C (Fig. 2 ) was performed in order to examine whether the applied calcination at 400, 600 and 900 °C was efficient for the total removal of the organic residues, possibly in some kind of coke, from the surface of MgO solids. Such carbonaceous residues may result from the incomplete combustion of PVA used in the synthesis bath. They can also act as traps of humidity. From the TG curves shown in Fig. 2 it can be seen that the samples MgO-PVA-400 and MgO-PVA-600 exhibit a significant mass loss in the range 50–250 °C and also a very notable mass-loss in the range 250–400 °C. The MgO-T and MgO-PVA-900 materials showed limited or no extra mass loss at these temperatures. In addition, the materials MgO-PVA-400 and MgO-PVA-600 exhibited a notable gradual mass loss in the range above 400 °C. A similar but much more limited loss was also observed for the sample MgO-400 above ∼500 °C and for MgO-600 above ∼750 °C. For the two solids MgO-PVA-400 and MgO-PVA-600, the first mass-loss in the range 50 250 °C amounted to ∼5.4% and can be attributed to the removal of loosely absorbed moisture on the surface of these samples. The second mass-loss at 250–400 °C, amounting to 8–9%, can be attributed either to the decomposition of magnesium hydroxide towards magnesium oxide and/or the removal of some carbonaceous residues from the solid surfaces. The third extensive and slow mass-loss in the range 400–900 °C can be attributed to the decomposition traces of magnesium carbonate to magnesium oxide and carbon dioxide, or removal of some other carbon residues possibly in the form of ill-defined coke, remaining on the surface after the first calcination. For the rest oxidic samples the mass loss in the high temperature range was quite small and lay between ∼1.2% to ∼1.4% respectively for the MgO-400 and 600 samples while it was insignificant for the MgO-900 and MgO-PVA-900 solids."
10,Nitrogen adsorption–desorption porosimetry,"3.3 Nitrogen adsorption–desorption porosimetry The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the oxides MgO-T and MgO-PVA-T are shown in Fig. 3 . The specific surface areas of the catalysts, calculated via the classical BET method, are shown in Table 1 and are in the range of 2–26 m2/g. These low values, as well as the form of isotherms in Fig. 3, suggest that the materials are not porous and their surface area is external. Only the samples MgO-PVA-400 and MgO-PVA-600 exhibit some kind of Type II hysteresis loop, reflecting a small amount of internal porosity. These two samples are exactly the ones which showed an appreciable mass loss in the TG experiments as shown in Fig. 2 and discussed above. The surface area variation of MgO-400, 600, 900 catalysts develops as 3 → 18 → 2 (m2/g). The initial increase in the step 400 → 600 must be due to removal of small amounts of water amounting to ∼3–4% (see TG in Fig. 2) from a thin shell on the surface of MgO particles forming Mg(OH)2, blocking the interstitial voidage and resulting in larger aggregates. Indeed trivial calculations show that for a MgO particle of diameter ∼30 nm containing a thin shell of 0.2–0.3 nm of Mg(OH)2 on its external surface, the removal of water via the reaction Mg(OH)2 → MgO + H2O, leads to a mass loss of around 2–3%. On the contrary the drop of the surface area in the step 600 → 900 must be attributed to thermal sintering between the MgO particles via the surface OH groups and the reaction MgOH+MgOH → −MgOMg + H2O. The corresponding surface areas of the MgO-PVA-400, 600, 900 materials decreased gradually with calcination temperature, in the order 26 → 11 → 10 (m2/g), as perhaps expected because of sintering effects. In comparison to the samples prepared without PVA, it seems that the initial MgO-PVA-400 particles do not possess a thin shell of surface water, probably due to the presence of some hydrophobic organic species remaining on their surface from the incomplete combusiton of PVA, as hinted by the TG experiments and also by the FTIR data discussed next. These variations of the external surface area (SBET), different for the MgO-T and MgO-PVA-T solids, are not artifacts but correspond exactly to the reversed variation of the size of MgO crystallites Dcrystallite, estimated via the XRD data and the Scherrer method, cited in Table 1. The inverse relationships between SBET and Dcrystallite are shown in Fig. 4 a for MgO-T and Fig. 4b for MgO-PVA-T. Nevertheless, the size of solid particles Dparticles corresponding to the measured external surface area S (m2/g) is larger compared to Dcrystallites. Those values can be estimated from the well known relationship S = 6000/ρ∙Dparticles where ρ = 3.5 (g/cm3) is the usual mass density of MgO from the literature. The values of Dparticle are tabulated in Table 1, along with the ratio (Dparticle)/(Dcrystallite) which reflects the number of crystallites per particle and the extent of sintering of the primary crystallites. The variation of Dparticle, as well as of (Dparticle)/(Dcrystallite), are also included in Figs. 4c and d respectively for the MgO-T and for MgO-PVA-T catalysts. As expected, they follow more or less parallel routes. It is worth mentioning that the variation of the crystallite size Dcrystallites (nm) of the MgO-PVA-T samples (Fig. 4a) as a function of temperature closely reflects similar studies by Bueno et al., 2014."
11,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,"3.4 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy The FTIR spectra of the solids are shown in Fig. 5 . We observe some common characteristic peaks, typical of MgO oxides, at 3703, 3650, 2925, 2854, 1463, 1378, 435 and 429 cm−1. The peaks at ∼3450 cm−1 for all samples correspond to the stretching vibration of OH bond of the physically absorbed water molecules while the peak at ∼2350 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of CO2 absorbed from the atmosphere. The most distinct and striking feature in these spectra is the band at ∼1450 cm−1 appearing in the solids MgO-PVA-400, 600. This twin band corresponds to the stretching vibration of carbonated/carbonaceous species and appears only in the samples synthesized in the presence of PVA, in contrast with those synthesized without this polymer. This is an additional evidence (on top of the TGA results in Fig. 2) for the presence of small amounts of carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface, probably in the form of some ill-defined coke. The intensity of this peak diminishes as the calcination increases from 400 °C→ 600 °C → 900 °C and at the highest temperature it practically nullifies as shown in the inset in Fig. 5. It is worth noticing that a similar twin band was observed in the Raman spectra of porous MgO-NiO/MgO nanocomposites, prepared via citrate precursors, by Chen et al., 2004. These authors attributed these bands to carbon species enwrapping during the preparation procedure the MgO particles fired consequently at N2 (0.5% O2) at 800 °C."
12,Scanning electron microscopy,"3.5 Scanning electron microscopy From the SEM images of Fig. 6 , the surface morphology of the samples can be observed. The surface arrangement of the samples synthesized without PVA is more fractured, disintegrated and irregular compared to the samples synthesized in the presence of PVA which exhibit a more or less flat surface. It can be seen that the sample MgO-400, MgO-600 and MgO-900 exhibit well crystallized particles in the range of ∼1 μm, which corresponds roughly to the size of particles Dparticle in Table 1. The samples synthesized in the presence of PVA, exhibit a shapeless structure with some large cavities."
13,Biodiesel production,"3.6 Biodiesel production In Fig. 7 the produced% Free Fatty Methyl Esters (FAME content), for all the tested catalysts is shown after 8 h reaction time. The transesterification reaction, which can be catalyzed by either acid or basic sites of the solids, has the general form: The important point in Fig. 7 is that the catalysts MgO-PVA-400 and MgO-PVA-600 are much more active, even after 2 h reaction when the corresponding%FAME content reaches 30%. After the 8 h period the FAME content for those active solids reaches the very high values of 98.4% and 97.7% respectively. It is worth noticing that both these two catalysts yield 98% FAME, exceeding the limit value of 96.5% which has been set for similar biodiesel specifications (EN 14214). On the contrary, all the other oxides MgO-PVA-900, MgO-400, MgO-600 and MgO-900 show very low activity and a FAME yield which never exceeds <5%. It is clear that the addition of PVA, in combination with middle firing temperatures, results in materials exhibiting dramatically enhanced activity as heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production."
14,Discussion,"The central question arising from the above results has to do with the possible reasons for the high catalytic activity of the MgO-PVA-400, 600 solids, in contrast to the other materials which were quite inactive. From the experimental data, scrutinized in details in the previous section, neither the crystallite size, nor the particle size, nor the surface areas show any detectable dependence on the enhanced catalytic activity of the MgO-PVA-400 and MgO-PVA-600 solids. On the contrary, the properties directly related to their increased activity are the thermal loss observed in the TG experiments (see Fig. 2) and the FTIR bands at 1450 cm−1 (see Fig. 5). This twin dependence is depicted in Fig. 8 – left and right. It is clear that the increased activity of MgO-PVA-400 and MgO-PVA-600 is directly related, on one hand, to the% mass loss occurring during heating in the range 250–400 °C and at >400 °C, as well as to the intensity of the FTIR bands at 1450 cm−1. In contrast, neither mass loss, nor adsorption band at 1450 cm−1 are apparent in the inactive samples MgO-T and MgO-PVA-900. It is worth mentioning that a similar twin IR band at 1450 cm−1 was also observed by Bueno et al., 2014, who studied the development of nanocrystalline MgO via the sol-gel combustion method using PVA and metal nitrate as precursor, but the objective of that work was not catalysis. The two quantities, e.g the% mass losses in the ranges 250–400 °C and >400 °C, as well as the I1450 intensity, must be due to carbonaceous residues on the surface of MgO-PVA-400,600 samples since similar findings are not apparent in the MgO-T solids, where no carbon source (PVA) was used, and in the solid MgO-PVA-900 where the carbonaceous residues were burned off from the surface. The presence of carbonic residues on the surface of MgO has been also mentioned in the past by Chen et al., 2004. This group prepared porous MgO-NiO/MgO nanocomposites via citrate precursors and firing at 800 °C in N2 (0.5% O2) and then at 400 °C in air. The carbon residues on the solid surface were observed by Raman spectroscopy. They attributed these to the fact that during the sample precipitation and drying, amorphous carbon enwraps the newly formed MgO particles, and some of it (carbon) residues after firing at middle temperatures. Similar phenomena may occur in the present case. These organic residues, probably in some form of coke, are totally removed after firing at 900 °C. Coke characterization is notoriously problematic and usually limited to the determination of its amount and elemental composition (Guisnet and Magnoux, 2001). The coke components are generally polyaromatic and their formation involves complex condensation, rearrangement and hydrogen transfer steps resulting in amorphous final products. Weiss has emphasized sometime ago (Weiss, 1962) that amorphous carbons may be regarded as organic polymers in which free radical structures and organic groups function as centers for the withdrawal or donation of electrons, i.e. as Lewis acids. More recently, other workers have drawn attention to the active sites in carbons for acid-base catalysis (Figueiredo et al., 2007). It has been shown that carbonyl/quinone groups on the surface of carbon are the active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (Pereira et al., 1999) and that the catalytic activity of carbon materials for the dehydration of methanol to dimethyl-ether was correlated with the concentration of strong acid sites (Moreno-Castilla et al., 2001). Thus, although carbons are not usually considered as a first choice of heterogeneous catalysts in transesterification reactions, they may prove to be active in such operations, as shown above. It is not clear at the moment if the catalytic path is triggered by acid or basic sites existing in the carbonaceous remains on the MgO-PVA-400, 600 solids. Thus, it is not possible to propose a relevant mechanism for the general reaction mentioned above. Such questions need further research. An attempt to compare the present data with other similar ones in the literatures faces the dilemma that, as far as we know, there are no similar data reported for the performance of carbonaceous catalysts in transesterification reactions. Nevertheless, a lot of experimental results exist on various Mg containing catalysts. A comparison of the activity of present oxidic solids to similar ones in the literature is given in Table 2 . It is observed that the oxides MgO-PVA-400 and MgO-PVA-600 are the most active simple MgO catalysts, providing 98.4 and 97.7% FAME after 8 h at 70 °C. The next single MgO active catalyst yields only to 89.6% at 150 °C after 6 h (Wen et al., 2010b). Moreover, the catalysts of the present work are more active than the supported MgO/MCM-41 where the%FAME content was 85% after 25 h reaction (Georgogianni et al., 2009) and the MgO/SBA-15 where the% FAME content was 96% after 5 h reaction at 220 °C (Li and Rudolph, 2008). Many research groups have studied the collective catalytic action of magnesium oxide mixed with standard basic components KOH and NaOH. Ilgen and Akin, 2009 added 20%wt KOH in MgO yielding 95.05% biodiesel after 9 h at 60 °C, which is inferior compared to the activity of the MgO-PVA catalysts of the present study. On the other hand, more active catalysts have been synthesized containing high amounts of alkalies. For example, 20% wt MgO-KOH yielded a 98% conversion in 20 min while in another work MgO-KOH and MgONaOH were reported to yield 100% and 78% FAME at 60 °C respectively (Manríquez-Ramírez et al., 2013; Mutreja et al., 2011). Finally, the catalysts of this work are less active compared to the Li doped magnesium oxides 0.08Li/MgO and 0.10Sr/MgO (Table 2) yielding 89.1% in 2 h and 93% in 30 min, respectively (Tantirungrotechai et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2010a). Nevertheless such results may be due to leaching of alkalies and the homogenization of the solid catalysts. We carried out experiments with the reused catalyst MgO-PVA-600 and its activity was diminished after the third batch experiment. Namely, in the second experiment the activity felt from 97.7% to 81% and in the third experiment from 81% to below 50%. Before each experiment the catalyst was washed with hexane and dried around 100 °C. It seems that those steps destroy the sensitive surface species, generated by PVA and responsible for the enhanced catalytic action. Such phenomena need further scrutiny. Before any possible commercial/industrial application of this catalyst, there should be scale – up experiments and optimizations in the process, in relation to the reaction temperature, the possible use of increased pressure, the catalyst synthetic route and catalyst content in the reaction mixture. All those points need further scrutiny."
15,Conclusions,"Magnesium oxides prepared by precipitation from nitrates in the presence of poly-vinyl-alcohol (PVA) were used as heterogeneous catalysts for the transesterification reaction of rapeseed oil with methanol for the production of biodiesel. The activity of such MgO catalysts, fired to middle temperature 400–600 °C, was increased compared to similar solids, prepared without addition of PVA, or those fired at higher temperature 900 °C. They also exhibited superior activity compared to similar heterogeneous catalysts based on MgO in the relevant literature. This increased activity of MgO-PVA catalysts is attributed to carbonaceous residues on their surface which contain active groups catalyzing the transesterification."
