0,Introduction,"For decades, biofuels have been explored as viable alternatives to crude oil in order to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions as well as reduced CO, CO2, SOx and particulate matter emissions from petrodiesel [1]. Biodiesel is an alternative diesel fuel synthesized by transesterification of vegetable oil or animal fat and short-chain alcohol such as methanol with a catalyst [2]. It refers to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of long-chain fatty acid with varying chemical and physical properties depending on parent oils. Biodiesel offers several benefits such as the reduction in exhaust emissions, high flash point, high lubricity, as well as high biodegradability [3]. Although many studies showed that the use of biodiesel imparted no long-term negative effects on diesel engines [4,5], the relatively low oxidation stability and unsatisfactory cold flow properties remain a challenge. Low oxidation stability due to a high amount of unsaturated FAMEs causes formations of peroxide compounds, aldehydes and ketones worsening the properties of FAMEs [3]. It has been reported that the storage of unsaturated FAME is difficult due to the increase in the viscosity and acid number caused by biodiesel oxidation [6,7]. Furthermore, an increase in saturated FAMEs leads to poor cold flow properties which can lead to the clogging of fuel supply lines and filters during cold weather situations [8]. Parameters such as cloud point and pour point used to indicate the cold flow properties of fuel can degrade in biodiesel [9]. Biodiesel derived from edible vegetable oils such as soybean oil tends to have better cold flow properties than biodiesel based on palm oil or from animal fats. Conversely, palm oil-based biodiesel shows higher oxidation stability and cetane number [10] than soybean-based biodiesel. To improve the quality of the biodiesel, these two properties, oxidation stability and cold flow properties, need to be enhanced together. Synthetic antioxidant additives, a fractionation (winterization) process, hydrodeoxygenation and hydrogenation are methods that can be used to enhance the oxidation resistance of biodiesel and, therefore, its cold flow properties. In addition, various biodiesel antioxidant additives such as pyrogallol (PY), propyl gallate (PG) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) [11,12] can increase an induction period. However, too high concentrations of additives lead to a high acid content which may deteriorate the fuel quality [13]. Fractionation, a method to modify the methyl ester composition by a physical process, aims to remove species with high melting points such as saturated methyl esters C18:0 and C16:0 [14]. These methyl esters are responsible for a poor cloud point. The elimination of the saturated fatty acid chains could result in lower oxidation stability since saturated fatty esters have a higher cetane number and greater oxidation stability than the unsaturated ones [14]. Removing oxygen from fatty acids at very high temperatures (>300 °C) and pressures (>5 MPa) in the presence of a catalyst is known as hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of triglyceride [13]. As a consequence of this treatment, HDO yield is a straight-chain n-alkane with an unaltered number of carbon atoms. The hydrogenation uses gaseous hydrogen and a catalyst to increase the hydrogen content in the organic compound. The same process is also employed for food lipids, e.g., margarine. The advantages of hydrogenation compared to other processes discussed above are the fact that no further processing or isomerization is required and no requirement to operate at high-temperature and high-pressure conditions (only at 80–120 °C and < 0.5 MPa) [13]. Palm oil as the basis for palm-based biodiesel and food products is mainly produced in Southeast Asia. It comprises polyunsaturated and monounsaturated double bonds which can be reduced by partial hydrogenation to improve its oxidation stability. The partial hydrogenation process can convert polyunsaturated (C18:3, C18:2) FAMEs into monounsaturated (C18:1) or saturated (C18:0) FAMEs [15]. Conventional partial hydrogenation of biodiesel relies on catalysts which always forms the undesirable trans-isomer which negatively impacts the cold flow properties. The catalysts commonly employed in commercial hydrogenation of biodiesel are Ni on an alumina or silica support structure or Pd on several types of carbon support structures [16]. Numwong et al. [16] carried out partial hydrogenation of polyunsaturated FAMEs using Pd/C catalyst over two types of reactors. The results revealed that a batch-type reactor provided high conversion of polyunsaturated FAME with high trans C18:1 composition of 17.4%. Thunyaratchatanon et al. [17] employed Pd/SiO2 with sulfur as a catalyst for partial hydrogenation of biodiesel. The trans C18:1 increased from 0.4 to 12.3% while the oxidation stability improved from 1.4 to 7.7 h. The obvious disadvantage of using a catalyst is the increase in the trans-isomers product, which is detrimental to fuel [3]. Plasma technologies are promising alternatives to catalytic hydrogenation. Usually, they are utilized in addition to the decomposition processes [18]. Plasmas can be generated in several ways including, but not limited to, corona discharge plasma, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma, arc discharge plasma, radiofrequency plasma and microwave plasma. Plasmas can lead to gas excitation and ionization if sufficient energy is transferred to the medium. Microwave-powered discharge induced plasmas, an electrodeless plasma generated by a magnetron supplying 2.45 GHz, provides a high plasma density with no electrode erosion and good energy distribution [19,20]. Microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) has been widely applied for diamond film synthesis for example. Microwave plasmas can also be applied in hydrogen production under atmospheric pressure [21], carbon film synthesis [22], methane and methanol production [23,24], and syngas formation [25,26]. Yepez and Keener [27] studied partial hydrogenation of soybean oil with no trans-fatty acids formation using high voltage atmospheric cold plasma (HVACP) at 90 kV and 200 W. The iodine value was reported to be reduced from 133 to 92 within 12 h of reaction time, while saturated fatty acids increased 12% without trans-fat formation. The plasma generation system consisted of 2 electrodes separated by 52 mm with 2 pieces of dielectric sheets in between. Soybean oil of 10 mL in a container was located on the dielectric sheet. Room-temperature hydrogen and nitrogen plasma were generated in this study where the authors reasoned that atomic hydrogen was likely responsible for the hydrogenation process. This plasma-based technique did not require high pressure, high temperature or a catalyst, and demonstrated a 50% energy efficiency compared to the current catalyzed reaction. Nonetheless, the authors noted that the reaction kinetic would need to be enhanced. Puprasit et al. [28] examined palm oil hydrogenation through non-thermal DBD plasma without a catalyst to produce margarine with low trans-fat. The system consisted of two parallel-plate electrodes separated by 15 mm, a high-voltage, high-frequency generator supplying a maximum of 10 kV and 30 mA @ 25 kHz, and a glass chamber containing 25 mL of oil with the total mixed H2 and He gas flow rate of 800 mL/min. The results revealed that the ratio of 15% H2 and 85% He and reaction temperature of 50 °C with 4 h of reaction time were optimal parameters leading to a good yield of hydrogenation while the iodine value is reduced from 60.9 to 48.4 and a trans-fat formation of only 1.4%. However, it necessitated a reaction time of up to 8 h to achieve a texture similar to commercial margarine. Kongprawes and group [29] carried out partial hydrogenation of biodiesel based on soybean oil employing DBD plasma in the absence of a catalyst to improve oxidation stability. The system consisted of a pair of parallel-plate electrodes connected to a high-voltage, high-frequency power supply (maximum of 10 kV and 30 mA @ 25 kHz) to generate plasma through mixed gas (He and H2). It was found that the plasma was effective in partial hydrogenation of FAME with a performance close to that of the conventional catalytic method. The oxidative stability increased to 10 h after 5.5 h of plasma treatment on 35 mL of feed biodiesel with a 47.3% reduction in the iodine value. The current study evaluates the novel application of low-temperature microwave plasma as a method of partial hydrogenation of palm biodiesel. The present study utilized an electrodeless microwave plasma, which completely eliminated potential biodiesel contamination and electrode degradation in the DBD plasma system studied by Kongprawes et al. [29], thus, presenting an improvement of biodiesel properties. The incorporation of the generated hydrogen ions is supported by an electrostatic field induced by a negative 60 kV to increase the reaction kinetics. This novel feature installed into the system has never been explored by any researcher. Furthermore, a magnetron tube from a household microwave oven was utilized to generate microwave power, as a low route. The effects of the hydrogen gas flow rate, microwave power, reaction temperature, negative high voltage and reaction time on the trans-to-cis ratio, were investigated. The properties of the so treated biodiesel were evaluated. The main outcome of the present study is a novel production method of partially hydrogenated biodiesel using non-thermal microwave plasma without the use of a catalyst. Furthermore, the low-pressure environment leads to a safer working environment. The plasma caused the increase in FAME temperature to about 30 °C, which did not cause the formation of the trans configuration of methyl esters."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Biodiesel based on palm oil was obtained from Patum Vegetable Oil Co., Ltd., Thailand. The ultra-high purity (UHP) hydrogen was purchased from Alternative Chemical Company Ltd., Thailand. All of the chemicals were of analytical reagent grade. Cyclohexane supplied from Loba Chemie Pvt., Ltd., chloroform obtained from Merck, sodium thiosulfate 5-hydrate and potassium iodide purchased from Kemaus and Ajax FineChem, and a starch solution prepared from corn starch of Super-Find brand purchased from a local supermarket were used to determine the iodine value, acid value and peroxide value. A Wijs solution was prepared from iodine monochloride and glacial acetic acid obtained from Panreac Applichem and QRëC, respectively."
3,Experimental setup,"2.2 Experimental setup 2.2.1 Reaction chamber The microwave plasma system consisted of a rectangular reaction chamber of Lock and Lock brand made of Pyrex glass. The base and the top of the chamber measured approximately 20.5 × 14.5 cm and 22.3 × 16 cm, respectively. The chamber was 7.2 cm in height with a maximum liquid holding capacity of 2000 mL. The top of the chamber was sealed to a lower stainless-steel flange using a high-temperature silicone sealant (Fig. 1 (c)). A Viton o-ring was employed to seal between the lower and upper flanges. The chamber is equipped with the plasma application port, thermocouple feedthroughs, vacuum gauge and pump connections, as well as a sampling port. The vacuum pumping port was connected to a rotary vacuum pump to generate low pressure in the chamber. In commercial production, hydrogen gas can easily be recycled using a simple recirculating pump operating at ambient temperature and low pressure, thus, no hydrogen gas would be released to the atmosphere from the closed system. The chamber was placed on a hotplate stirrer to allow stirring and heating of the biodiesel. Since the main species of interest were atomic hydrogen and hydrogen ion to hydrogenate carbon double bonds, a novel method to accelerate hydrogen ion onto biodiesel was implemented by placing a stainless-steel disc of 5.6 cm in diameter underneath the plasma chamber at the location right below the opening of the downstream plasma source (see Section 2.2.2 for the description of the plasma source). The stainless-steel disc was electrically connected to a Spellman negative DC high voltage power supply model PS/MK60N01.2 (adjustable from 0 to 60 kV, 1.5 mA maximum). The ground of the power supply was connected to the flanges and the body of the downstream plasma source, which was further connected to the earth ground. This would establish an intense electric field pointing downward to accelerate the generated positive hydrogen ions onto the surface of biodiesel to improve the reaction kinetics. 2.2.2 Microwave plasma generating system The plasma generating system uses a magnetron and the power supply adopted from a 1000 W household microwave oven (Electrolux brand, model EMM2009W). The power supply was connected to a variac to regulate the voltage to the system to allow control of the magnetron power output and the plasma density. The utilized downstream plasma source (Astex brand, model FI20101 revision 1F, sapphire tube with the maximum power handling capacity of 3 kW) was an industrial plasma source used in the integrated circuit fabrication industry, such as for polymer removal from silicon wafers and in CVD processes, so it is a highly efficient and powerful plasma generator. It is also very flexible in terms of application process parameters and has been shown to function highly satisfactorily in the present hydrogenation research. UHP H2 gas was supplied to the plasma source via a mass flow controller (Unit Instruments model UFC-1000). The plasma application port on the upper flange connected to the bottom of the downstream plasma source was installed 3 cm from one side of the reaction chamber. This allows space for magnetic stirring inside the chamber. To enhance the contact between the biodiesel and the generated hydrogen radicals, a 5 cm diameter glass tube was connected to the plasma application port extending downward into the plasma chamber terminating at approximately 2 mm from the bottom of the chamber. This feature ensures that gas leaving the plasma source bubbles through the biodiesel layer before leaving the system. Photographs and a diagram of the experimental setup are shown in Fig. 1(a)–(d)."
4,Partial hydrogenation of biodiesel,"2.3 Partial hydrogenation of biodiesel The effect of hydrogen gas flow rate (4.0, 6.5, and 8.5 L/min) was evaluated using 400 W of microwave power. 30 kV negative accelerating voltage was applied at ambient temperature. Again, in commercial operation, hydrogen gas can easily be recycled using a simple recirculating pump, thus, no hydrogen gas would be vented to the atmosphere. Furthermore, the effect of microwave power in the range of 300–500 W was studied as well as the effect of reaction temperature of 30, 55, 80 °C and accelerating high voltage of 30 and 60 kV, as well as the reaction time from 1 to 4 h. The study on the effect of temperature was performed as temperature usually plays an important role in chemical reactions including plasma hydrogenation. Because hydrogenation is exothermic [30], reduced temperatures should facilitate the equilibrium conversion while higher temperatures could increase reaction kinetics but unfavorably reduce hydrogen gas solubility in the bulk vegetable oil [31]. Which effect is dominating the outcome of the process is studied here. For all experiments, 300 mL of biodiesel was first added to the reaction chamber and the air was then removed for a minimum of 10 min to reduce the amount of oxygen or other gases in the chamber. Hydrogen gas was slowly added into the downstream plasma source. The pressure inside the chamber varied depending on the gas flow rate. Ones the pressure stabilized, the variac was used to gradually increase the microwave power. The manual tuning stubs were adjusted to minimize the reflected power while the variac was regulated to achieve the desired delivered microwave power into the plasma source. The biodiesel was continuously stirred at 200 rpm by a magnetic bar. All experiments were performed twice and the reported numbers represented the average with the error bars showing the range of the values. The reaction was allowed to take place for 1 h, except for the final study on the effect of reaction time as samples were collected at 1, 2, 3 and 4 h."
5,Evaluation of partially hydrogenated biodiesel properties,"2.4 Evaluation of partially hydrogenated biodiesel properties The obtained partially hydrogenated biodiesel (H-FAME) was analyzed for FAME yield and composition following the EN 14103 standard [32] using Shimadzu GC 2010 Plus to ensure compliance with the standard of ≥ 96.5% FAME yield. The system of GC was installed with a flame ionization detector and a DB wax capillary column with helium as a carrier gas. The FAME sample and methyl heptadecanoate (internal standard) were dissolved with n-heptane as a solvent. 1 μL of solution was used and the temperature was held at 150 °C for 5 min initially and subsequently increased to 190 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min with 5 min holding time, then raised to 220 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min and held for 5 min. The detector temperature was 250 °C. FAME yield was calculated according to Eq. (1): (1) F A M E y i e l d % = ( ∑ A ) - A I S A I S x C I S x V I S m x 100 % where ∑ A = total peak area, A I S = peak area of methyl heptadecanoate (internal standard), C I S = concentration of methyl heptadecanoate (mg/mL), V I S =volume of methyl heptadecanoate (mL) and m = mass of FAME sample (mg). The compositions of FAME and H-FAME were calculated according to Eq. (2): (2) X c o m p o s i t i o n % = A X Σ A - A I S x 100 % where ΣA = total peak area, A X = peak area of the type of methyl ester composition (such as C16:0 and C18:0), A I S = peak area of methyl heptadecanoate (internal standard). Chemical functional groups were identified by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of Perkin Elmer model Spectrum One with UATR technique, the scan range of 500–4000 cm−1 and resolution of 4.0 cm−1. The oxidation stability was evaluated by EC Meter model EC-450L, Istek Inc., Korea according to the modified Rancimat test following the EN 15751:2009 method [33]. The cloud point and pour point were measured following the ASTM D 2500 [34] and D 97 [35] standards, respectively, with Walter Herzog GmbH, Germany, equipment. The acid value indicates the presence of acidity in biodiesel, which was determined following the AOCS method by titration [36]. The iodine value measures the degree of unsaturated oil reacted with iodine [37]. The Wijs method was used in the present work [38]. The peroxide value indicates a hydroperoxide content in oxidized oils or fuel, which is caused by oxygen in the air reacting with FAMEs leading to oxidative degradation of biodiesel. The method to measure peroxide value was followed the procedure laid out by Santos et al. [39]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Microwave plasma generation,"3.1 Microwave plasma generation 3.1.1 Mechanism of microwave plasma generation Initially, the free (unbound) electrons in the system receive energy from high-frequency electric field generated by microwave radiation. They oscillate according to the rapidly changing electric field. They then collide with heavy particles, hydrogen gas in this case, imparting a small portion of their energy to create excitation, dissociation and ionization [40]. This phenomenon produces numerous highly energetic free electrons in the system, and they can induce a large quantity of atomic hydrogen, excited species, as well as ionized species. Shivkumar and the group [41] proposed the three reactions of hydrogen gas in the microwave plasma as excitation, dissociation, and ionization expressed in Eqs. (3) to (5), respectively. Goodyear and Engel [42], besides, suggested that the dominant process of hydrogen in a high-frequency device is dissociation, followed by ionization ( H → H + ) . Therefore, in the present study, the hydrogen atom (H) and hydrogen ion (H+ or a proton particle) are responsible to react with unsaturated hydrocarbons which are explained in Section 3.9. (3) H 2 + e - → H 2 ∗ + e - (4) H 2 + e - → H + H + e - (5) H 2 + e - → H 2 + + 2 e - 3.1.2 Plasma spectrum analysis An Ocean Optics spectrometer (USB4000 model, wavelength range approximately 200–1050 nm, XR1-500 line grating blazed at 250 nm, and L4 lens) connected to a fiber optic cable was employed to analyze the spectrum of the plasma through a viewport at the top of the downstream plasma source. The associated OceanView software was used for visualization. An example of the resulting plasma spectrum is shown in Fig. 2 which was collected under microwave power of 500 W, H2 flow rate of 8.5 L/min, negative accelerating voltage of 60 kV and 30 °C of reaction temperature. The inset shows the spectrum without plasma generation. The spectrum of the atomic hydrogen Balmer series was identified as alpha and beta lines. The Hα line was observed at 656.20 nm being the strongest, while the Hβ line was present at 485.76 nm, correlating with ni of 3 and 4, respectively. However, the spectrum did not show the gamma and delta lines located at around 434 and 410 nm, respectively [43]. Nonetheless, the spectrum confirmed the presence of atomic hydrogen without other species according to the spectral resolution and detection limit of the spectrometer."
8,FT-IR analysis,"3.2 FT-IR analysis The FT-IR spectra of feed FAME and H-FAME are shown in Fig. 3 . The feed FAME (Fig. 3(a)) showed three main regions. The specific band at 723 cm−1 illustrated the cis-isomer of C - H [44]. The region between 900 and 1300 cm−1, the so-called fingerprint region [45], indicated various stretching vibrations related to different bonds and functional groups. The bands at around 1200 and 1168 cm−1 represented asymmetric axial stretching of CC( = O) - O bonds and O - C - C bonds, respectively [46]. The region around 1700 – 1800 cm−1 showed a sharp absorption peak at 1741 cm−1 which was consistent with C = O double bond stretching referred to as the ester carbonyl functional group [44]. The third interval is in the between 2600 and 3200 cm−1. The three significant peaks at 2852, 2921 and 3002 cm−1 were assigned to C - H symmetric stretching, C - H anti-symmetric stretching of a methylene group ( - CH2) and C - H stretching of CH = CH cis-configuration, respectively, which were presented in the unsaturated FAME [44]. After the microwave plasma treatment of FAME as presented in Fig. 3(b), the peak at 3002 cm−1 of C - H stretching of CH = CH reduced compared to feed FAME, indicating that biodiesel became more saturated through the hydrogenation reaction. Furthermore, the absence of the vibration peak at 966 cm−1 illustrated in Fig. 3(c) indicated that the trans-isomer of = C - H (C18:1) was not presented."
9,Effect of H2 feed flow rate on H-FAME composition,"3.3 Effect of H2 feed flow rate on H-FAME composition To study the influence of H2 flow rate, all parameters were held constant at 30 °C, 400 W, 1 h and 30 kV negative high voltage while the H2 flow rates of 4.0, 6.5 and 8.5 L/min were evaluated. It is important to note that all hydrogen gas flown into the plasma system can be recycled to generate new hydrogen radicals using a recirculating pump. Fig. 4 illustrates the change in H-FAME composition (compare to feed FAME) under different H2 feed flow rates. For every flow rate, the C18:3 and C18:2 contents lessened significantly while C18:0 increased substantially. C16:0 increased slightly while C18:1 decreased slightly. The observed “lever” effect of plasma hydrogenation was expected. Double-bonded carbon atoms were converted into single bonds, so C18:3, C18:2 and C18:1 must be reduced while C18:0 and C16:0 must increase. The effect was most pronounced at 8.5 L/min, the maximum flow rate in the present study, as C16:0 increased by 5.3% and C18:0 increased by 37.8%, while C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3 decreased by 4.5, 20.0 and 73.6%, respectively. The alteration of the fatty acid composition of H-FAME was more pronounced with a higher hydrogen flow rate. Higher flow rates supplies more H2 gas to be dissociated into atomic hydrogen while subsequently providing a continues flow of free radicals before recombination with free electrons despite the very short lifespan of 10−9–10−6 s [47]. A higher flow than 8.5 L/min increases the challenge of maintaining the plasma. As a result, 8.5 L/min was found to be ideal while the surplus of hydrogen could be recycled."
10,Effect of microwave power on H-FAME composition,"3.4 Effect of microwave power on H-FAME composition Throughout the 3 microwave power levels studied (300, 400, and 500 W), the reaction temperature of 30 °C, H2 flow rate of 8.5 L/min, negative accelerating voltage of 30 kV and reaction time of 1 h was held constant. The result of H-FAME compositional changes is presented in Fig. 5 . It was found that the saturated fatty acid contents, especially C18:0, increased with increasing microwave power absorbed by H2 gas to produce plasma, while polyunsaturated FAME contents (C18:2, C18:3) reduced. The C18:1 content was also slightly reduced with more microwave power. The observed trend in Fig. 5 is very similar to that of Fig. 4. Higher microwave power generated higher plasma density and a larger amount of hydrogen free radicals to saturate the double bonds. At 500 W, the decrease in C18:2 and C18:3 was 23.7 and 86.1%, respectively. Therefore, 500 W of microwave power was chosen as an optimal condition. Conventional catalyzed FAME hydrogenation can selectively increase the C18:1 content, which was the preferable composition for H-FAME production [16]. In the present experiment at 500 W, the C18:1 content was reduced by approximately 5.4% compared to the feed FAME. Since plasma-catalyzed hydrogenation is a random process to randomly add hydrogen atoms to any available CC bonds, selectivity was hard to achieve [48]."
11,Effect of reaction temperature on H-FAME composition,"3.5 Effect of reaction temperature on H-FAME composition The influence of reaction temperature was evaluated over three temperatures: 30, 55 and 80 °C. The experiments were conducted at 8.5 L/min H2 flow rate, 500 W microwave power, 30 kV negative accelerating voltage and reaction duration of 1 h. For the 30 °C case, the rising temperature from room temperature (22–23 °C) was due to plasma heating only. The hotplate stirrer was used to control the biodiesel/H-FAME temperature for the experiments at higher temperatures. The results illustrated in Fig. 6 indicate that the hydrogenation rate reduced with the increase in reaction temperature from 30 to 80 °C. For the 30 °C case, both C18:3 and C18:2 contents were continuously hydrogenated with a content reduction of 86.1 and 23.8%, respectively. The C18:1 composition is slightly reduced while the C18:0 content remarkably increased by 42.4%. This finding was in contrast to the results of FAME hydrogenation using physical catalysts [16,44], where hydrogenation rates could be accelerated by raising the reaction temperature owing to the kinetics principle. Because the hydrogenation process is exothermic [30,49], low temperature yielded better results. Research of Tomoto and Kusano [31] revealed that higher temperature could significantly reduce the solubility of hydrogen gas in vegetable oil, and this may be another reason why the FAME hydrogenation rate reduced with elevated temperature. Moreover, the advantage of a low-temperature condition is that no external heating provision is required, reducing energy requirement as well as being cost-effective."
12,Effect of accelerating high voltage on H-FAME composition,"3.6 Effect of accelerating high voltage on H-FAME composition Three levels of negative high voltage (0, 30 and 60 kV) were examined. The parameters were held constant at a microwave power was 500 W with H2 gas flow rate of 8.5 L/min, reaction temperature of 30 °C, and reaction time of 1 h. Fig. 7 displays the results of the study. The fatty acid composition changes appeared to be similar to Figs. 4–6. Overall, there was a reduction of C18:3, C18:2 and C18:1 and an increase of C16:0 and C18:0. The effect of negative accelerating high voltage on the hydrogenation reaction was according to the expectation. The negative high voltage of 60 kV showed more effect than 30 and 0 kV, especially on the C18:0 and C18:3 content. The higher the negative voltage (60 kV), the stronger the generated electric field to accelerate hydrogen ions to react with biodiesel, significantly enhancing the hydrogenation kinetic with only minor power input. This negative accelerating high voltage technique with microwave plasma is a truly new finding with promising potential to be applied to other experiments."
13,Effect of reaction time on H-FAME composition,"3.7 Effect of reaction time on H-FAME composition The plasma exposure time was varied from 1 to 4 h with 500 W of microwave power, H2 gas flow rate of 8.5 L/min, reaction temperature of 30 °C and negative high voltage of 60 kV. The results are displayed in Fig. 8 . Longer reaction time resulted in more fatty acids composition changes. There was a decrease in polyunsaturated (C18:2 and C18:3) and monounsaturated (C18:1) FAMEs, while there was a notable increase in saturated FAMEs (C16:0, C18:0) with reaction time. However, the increase in the C16:0 content may be due to molecular chain scission through energetic electrons cutting the CC bonding at C2H5 - or CH3 - termination of long-chain hydrocarbon leading to its destruction [50]. Also, some studies reported that plasma cracking can occur with long-chain hydrocarbons, especially palm oil, to become shorter chains [51,52]. The findings with C18 chains were consistent with palm biodiesel hydrogenation using Pd-supported catalysts, which reported that polyunsaturated and cis-monounsaturated FAME decreased while saturated FAME slightly increased [53]. To choose an optimal reaction time, the oxidation stability and the cloud point are the key factors. The oxidation stability at 3 and 4 h of reaction time was 21.6 and 24.5 h, respectively, while the cloud point was 16 and 18 °C, respectively. Longer reaction time resulted in higher oxidation stability while at the same time caused the cloud point to go higher. Therefore, when considering these two competing factors, the reaction time of 3 h was appropriate as the cloud point did not exceed the EN 14214 standard of 16 °C."
14,Methyl esters composition of FAME,"3.8 Methyl esters composition of FAME The quantitative analysis of methyl esters compositions of feed FAME and H-FAME by gas chromatography is given in Fig. 9 and Table 1 . The peak areas of methyl esters were measured to provide quantitative compositions. The analyzed H-FAME was microwave plasma hydrogenated under the following parameters: 500 W of microwave power, H2 flow rate of 8.5 L/min, negative accelerating voltage of 60 kV, 30 °C reaction temperature (starting at about 22–23 °C and stabilizing at 30 °C due to plasma heating) and reaction time of 3 h. In Fig. 9(a) and (b), all of the peaks corresponding to methyl ester compositions were detected. It is important to note that the C17:0 peak is of an internal standard. After successful hydrogenation as shown in Fig. 9(b), the peak at the retention time of about 16.7 min corresponding to C18:0 appeared higher, while the peaks at around 17, 18 and 19.7 min for C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3, respectively, appeared smaller compared to the feed FAME (Fig. 9(a)). The methyl esters composition data shown in Table 1 represent the mean value with standard deviation. As the present research used biodiesel derived from palm oil, large compositions of methyl palmitate (C16:0) and cis-methyl oleate (C18:1) were detected, accounting for nearly 85.7 w/w% of total fatty acid methyl ester compositions. The low methyl linoleate (C18:2) and methyl linolenate (C18:3) contents in the analyzed H-FAME directly affected the oxidation of the fuel because the oxidation rate was influenced by the number of double bonds present in the chain of methyl esters [54]. Also, the absence of the trans configuration in the feed FAME was desirable because it would cause an unnecessary increase in the melting point and cloud point [55]. After hydrogenation, the methyl esters compositions changed significantly. C18:3 was completely hydrogenated while C18:1 and C18:2 were reduced to 33.2% and 3.2%, respectively. The C18:0 content also showed a significant increase of almost 3 times compared to the feed biodiesel. It is interesting to observe that after hydrogenation, a 6.5% increase in the C16 (C16:0) content was almost balanced by a loss of approximately 7.7% of total C18 (C18:0–C18:3), which is consistent with the statement in Section 3.7 that the cracking reaction of a long-chain hydrocarbon can take place through high-energy particles produced by plasma [52], as they could scissor C18:0 methyl ester into C16:0. Because GC with DB-WAX capillary column cannot detect the trans-isomer peak, to evaluate the trans-to-cis ratio of H-FAME, the FTIR spectrum was employed to calculate trans H-FAME directly. From Fig. 3(c) at wavenumber 966 cm−1, there was no detectable C18:1 trans-isomer formation after 3 h of treatment. With the cis-isomer of C18:1 H-FAME after 4 h from Fig. 8 of 33.2%, the trans-to-cis ratio was essentially zero. This ratio was quite similar to the research of Kongprawes et al. [29] who examined partial hydrogenation of soya biodiesel by DBD plasma and reported the trans-to-cis ratio of C18:1 as 0.1 (2.0% trans-). On the contrary, Yepaz and Keener [27] detected no trans-fatty acid when hydrogenating soybean oil with high-voltage atmospheric cold plasma. Puprasit and the group [28] reported trans-fat present in palm oil hydrogenation using non-thermal DBD plasma as 1.4%. The absence of the trans- formation in the present work was mainly due to the low treatment temperature resulting in a positive impact on fuel properties, whereas traditional catalyzed biodiesel hydrogenation can generate high amounts of trans-configuration from C18:1 and C18:2 because of elevated reaction temperature. For instance, the use of Pd/SBA-15 operated at 100 °C produced 7.7% trans- [53], while using Pd/SiO2 operated at 80–120 °C produced 11–15% trans- [44]. A comparative summary of trans formation for studies of biodiesel/oil hydrogenation is shown in Table S1 in supporting document."
15,Suggested reaction mechanism of hydrogen plasma hydrogenation,"3.9 Suggested reaction mechanism of hydrogen plasma hydrogenation As mentioned in Section 3.1.1, the main reactive hydrogen species in the microwave plasma are atomic hydrogen (or hydrogen radicals) and hydrogen ions (or proton particles) [42]. This also corresponds with the result of the OES analysis shown in Fig. 2 that H α with the high-intensity peak may represent H atoms. So, the H atoms/H ions must have played an important role in any suggested mechanism. The suggested possible FAME hydrogenation reaction mechanisms by H atoms/H ions are hydrogenation, conjugation, Diels–Alder [56] and cracking reaction [52]. For hydrogenation, the atomic H reacts with any pi ( π ) bond of fatty acid methyl esters, forming a bond that converts the carbon in the chain into a free radical state. Consequently, this radical carbon in the chain reacts with further atomic H and forms a stable bond [57]. For the case of conjugation, the H ion reacts with bis-allylic hydrogen [56], which is the strongest transfer position, on the methyl esters chain creating double bonds shifting. For the Diels–Alder polymerization, as the name suggests, it is initiated with the conjugated double bonds of the methyl ester (especially methyl linoleate and methyl linolenate) [56,58] linking with another double bond of the methyl ester, forming a linked polymer similar to polymerization of monomers. The cracking reaction may undergo through a highly energetic electron cutting the CC bonding, the weakest bond, of the long-chain stearic methyl ester (C18:0) at the end of the structure, especially C2H5 - and CH3 - , forming small unstable excited molecules and an excited palmitic methyl ester (C16:0). If the electron cracks at CH3 - , the two-stage cracking would occur as C17:0 was not changed by the GC analysis. Then, the radical state of C16 methyl ester reacts with an H atom to form a stable state [50]. All of the suggested reaction mechanisms are presented in Fig. 10 . We hypothesize that in this study, the hydrogenation mechanism was dominating because of the significant increases in C16:0 and C18:0, while the cracking process resulted in the increase of the C16:0 content by about 7.7%. Conjugation and Diels–Alder polymerization most likely occurred to a much smaller extent. To detect the shifting double bond and polymerization products, a GC–MS technique would be required. Due to the limitation of the GC device used, these indicators, conjugated linoleic and polymerization products, cannot be detected. Nonetheless, for the case of Diels–Alder polymerization products, when comparing the methyl ester yield before and after plasma hydrogenation (Table 2 ), the yield reduced slightly while the kinematic viscosity increased slightly. Hence, one could interpret this such that only a rather small amount of polymerization occurred due to Diels–Alder polymerization. If polymerization occurred to a larger extent, one may expect some gel formation which was not found."
16,Properties of biodiesel,"3.10 Properties of biodiesel Various important feed FAME and H-FAME properties were evaluated and compared against the standards as depicted in Table 2. 3.10.1 Physicochemical properties The methyl ester content before and after hydrogenation met the EN 14214 standard. The density of H-FAME reduced very slightly by a nonsignificant fraction, while hydrogenation made FAME slightly more viscous. These values were still within the tolerances for the standards. The iodine content was reduced by about 20% compared to feed FAME, indicating a lower amount of double bonds due to hydrogenation. The acid value became slightly lower but was still within the standard. The peroxide value was about 2 times lower than that of the feed, which was highly desirable because peroxide or hydroperoxide products from the oxidation process can form insoluble gums and sediments causing fuel filter plugging. The presence of unconverted oil, monoglyceride (MG), diglyceride (DG) and triglyceride (TG), as well as glycerol in biodiesel, can degrade the engine’s operation [59]. In this work, the MG, DG and TG levels, including total glycerol and free glycerol, are all within the acceptable ranges. The water contents of the feed and hydrogenated biodiesel are 0.096 and 0.084 %wt, respectively, reducing by 12.5% owing to the vacuum procedure before the plasma was applied. Although both values are higher than the standard, this is because the feed biodiesel was stored for an extended period before being used in this experiment, and biodiesel can absorb ambient moisture during storage. 3.10.2 Oxidation stability As palm biodiesel comprised mostly C18:1 and C16:0, untreated FAME already exhibited a relatively high induction period of 12.5 h under the Rancimat test as shown in Table 2. After successful microwave plasma hydrogenation for 3 h, the oxidation stability of H-FAME was improved to 21.6 h. A majority of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated FAMEs were saturated to become stearate (C18:0) and palmitate (C16:0) methyl esters corresponding to the report of Zuleta et al. [60] that the FAME composition affected the biodiesel oxidation rate by conversion of polyunsaturated to saturated FAME more than environmental conditions. The high oxidation stability also agrees with the decrease in the iodine content compared to feed FAME as shown in Table 2. By comparing to catalytic hydrogenation of palm biodiesel, Chen et al. [53] used 0.6 g supported Pd catalyst at elevated temperature of 100 °C and high pressure of 0.3 MPa with time-on-stream (TOS) of 28 h and feed rate of 0.37 g min−1. The oxidation stability was enhanced from 19.4 to 27.9 h (an increase of 8.5 h). Phumpradit and the group [61] used 30 wt% Ni/Silica fiber at the temperature of 140 °C and pressure of 0.1 MPa with the FAME feed rate of 0.44 g min−1 and reaction time of 4 h. The oxidation stability was increased from 16 to 23 h (an increase of 7 h). The studied catalyst-free microwave plasma hydrogenation at room temperature (30 °C) with the pressure of 1.6 kPa, feed volume of 300 mL, and reaction time of 3 h showed a superior performance as the oxidation stability increased from 12.5 to 21.6 h (an increase of 9.1 h). 3.10.3 Cold flow properties Cold flow properties are mainly affected by carbon chain length and the degree of saturation of biodiesel. They are indicated by the cloud point, the temperature of the fuel at which solid crystals can be visible, and the pour point, the lowest temperature at which the fuel can pour down from a container. The present study demonstrated that the cloud point of H-FAME met the EN 14214 standard while the pour point was slightly higher than ASTM D 6751. The major influence of cold flow properties is the high content of saturated FAMEs. The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) has recently set the standard of the oxidation stability, cloud point, and pour point of B100 as 10 h minimum, 16 °C maximum, and 13 °C maximum, respectively [53]. This suggests that the pour point of the microwave plasma hydrogenated FAME fulfills these standard settings. Besides, high cloud point and pour point would have no effect on H-FAME used in tropical countries. However, to improve the cold flow properties for use in cold weather, it can be blended with diesel fuels or biodiesel based on vegetable oils with lower crystallization temperatures [8]. The present study successfully hydrogenated biodiesel through the novel microwave plasma technique at low temperatures without the use of a catalyst. Also, negative high voltage was applied to the system to significantly increase the hydrogenation kinetic. The oxidation stability was improved with no formation of trans isomerization compared to a conventional catalyzed reaction. Due to the high plasma density, microwave plasma can be beneficial in terms of reducing the reaction time or increasing the amount of feed FAME to be hydrogenated. Due to the absence of the trans-isomer, the microwave plasma system equipped with negative high voltage may also be used for hydrogenation of vegetable oils or animal fats at a reduced temperature without a catalyst. This would allow the production of low trans-fat margarine. Furthermore, the absence of a catalyst in the microwave plasma system leads to higher process sustainability since the catalyst does not need to be removed reducing the amount of wastewater from the product washing process. Moreover, the preparation of certain types of catalysts requires additional steps at high pressure and high temperature."
17,Conclusions,"H-FAME has been successfully synthesized in the microwave plasma reactor equipped with negative high voltage at room temperature without a catalyst. The optimal condition was 8.5 L/min hydrogen flow rate, 500 W microwave power, 30 °C reaction temperature, 60 kV negative high voltage and 3 h of reaction time. The highest conversion of polyunsaturated FAMEs (C18:2 and C18:3) and the highest C16:0, C18:0 and C18:1 yields were observed with the decrease in the iodine value from 50.2 to 40.1. This treatment resulted in no trans-C18:1 formation, which is superior to the traditional catalytic hydrogenation process. The oxidation stability of H-FAME increased from 12.5 to 21.6 h with good cold flow properties. Future studies will refine the parameters and investigate processes such as stirring to enhance efficiency with the final goal to enhance the capacity in a pilot plant. Furthermore, the microwave plasma system equipped with negative high voltage can be applied in the hydrogenation of other chemicals at low temperatures without using a catalyst. Because the technique resulted in no trans-isomer formation, it should be investigated to produce trans-fat-free margarine based on vegetable oils. This could become a green and novel production method replacing conventional trans-fat-rich margarine."
