0,Introduction,"Essential oils (EOs) are extracted from aromatic plants, which are natural, hydrophobic and volatile components with a pronounced odor. The EOs are a rich source of different bioactive compounds such as phenol derived aromatic components, terpenes and terpenoids [1]. The EOs are used in a wide range of applications in pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical and food industries due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antibacterial, sedative, analgesic, spasmolytic and flavoring properties [2–4]. However, when the EOs are exposed to the environment of oxygen, light and heat, most ingredients can be easily oxidized and deteriorated [5,6]. Encapsulation technology is employed to incorporate and preserve the stability, bioactivity and bioavailability of active components of EOs. The incorporation EOs in the composite films has been a recently adopted technique to protect flavor components from destructive changes, particularly in wound dressing and food packaging materials. Wound dressings are used to stop bleeding, protect wound against infections, absorb excess exudates and maintain wound hydration to accelerate the healing process by the incorporation of bioactive components [7,8]. Active food packaging is a rapidly emerging and promising technology in which the antimicrobial or antioxidant agents are incorporated into the packaging materials. It can provide the packed food high quality, safety and long shelf life, usually by reducing or retarding the growth of microorganisms. Recently, the production of EOs incorporated composite films is growing attention to manufacture a new generation of wound dressings and food packaging materials composed of different kinds of natural or synthetic or their combinations with suitable biological characteristics [8–12]. Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) and black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) are associated with a number of health benefits which have led to their comprehensive use in a variety of commercial natural products offered in the emerging nutraceutical and functional foods market due to their various biological properties such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and antidiabetic activities [13,14]. Ginger essential oil (GEO) is extracted from the roots of the plant Zingiber officinale Roscoe. The main chemical compounds of GEO are α-zingiberene, β-sesquiphellandrene, camphene, and ar-curcumene [15,16]. Black pepper essential oil (BPEO) is basically composed of terpenes, which have been found to be β-caryophyllene, pinene, δ-3-carene and limonene [14,17]. Both GEO and BPEO are widely used EOs worldwide, and have been reported to possess strong antimicrobial, antifungal and antioxidant activities [14,16]. In recent years, the incorporation of bioactive compounds using natural biopolymers has attracted considerable interest. They exhibit enhanced stability, excellent biodegradability, improved aqueous solubility of lipophilic compounds, enhanced bioavailability and bioefficacy and reduced toxicity [13,16,18–22]. Among the biopolymers, chitosan (CS) and gum arabic (GA) have been widely used as encapsulating material owing to its biocompatibility, low toxicity, etc. CS, a product of the deacetylated chitin, is considered as promising positively charged polysaccharide for preparing composite films owing to its good film forming ability, biocompatibility and biodegradation [19]. Numerous studies have reported that CS films had enhanced antimicrobial activities with high water resistance during the encapsulation of EOs [19,23,24] due to the interactions with the majority of the aromatic compounds by hydrogen bonding [25] and through the Schiff based reactions [26]. However, EOs encapsulated CS films did not show significant improvement in retention and release properties of EOs due to the weak hydrogen bonding between CS and EOs, because which is not sufficient for the retention of volatile compounds in EOs [27,28]. In order to overcome these drawbacks, the addition of other encapsulating agents such as the addition of emulsifier or polymers into the CS matrix could improve the compatibility of the multi-phased system, thus enhanced the retention and release properties of EOs [29]. GA is a negatively charged polysaccharide-protein complex with excellent emulsifying properties, which is obtained from the stems and branches of acacia trees. The hydrophilic parts facilitate stabilizing the emulsion against droplet aggregation, while the hydrophobic branched proteins are quickly adsorbed onto the emulsion droplet surface [30,31]. GA had unique characteristics such as commercial availability, high solubility, less viscosity, emulsification, good film forming, non-toxic and biocompatibility [32,33]. GA could overcome the stability, solubility and bioavailability issues of antioxidants due to the presence of amino acids [33]. Furthermore, to assist CS composite film formation, usage of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is quite common as a biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic and water soluble synthetic polymer. The PVA is a polymer that is well known for its smooth film forming capacity, easy process ability and chemical resistance properties, which can be effectively utilize in nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and medicinal fields [8,9,34]. In this study, the selection of GEO and BPEO was mainly based on their well-established biomedical activities and phytochemical components. The aim of the study is the incorporation of GEO and BPEO in PVA/GA/CS composite film by solvent casting technique to enhance the stability of EOs, protect their bioactive constituents, attain sustained release profile, and improve their antibacterial activities for food, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications due to the advancement of antimicrobial activity, healing property compared with traditional packing and dressings. The incorporation of EOs was investigated using different characterization techniques viz. IR, XRD, DSC and SEM along with the physical, thermal and mechanical properties. In addition, retention and release studies were estimated for both incorporated EOs. Furthermore, the antibacterial activity was also studied for incorporated EOs."

The results of the GC have interpreted using National Institute of Standard Technology – MS search library version 2.0 (NIST 14)."
4,Preparation of PVA/GA/CS composite film with and without BPEO and GEO,"2.3 Preparation of PVA/GA/CS composite film with and without BPEO and GEO The PVA solution 17% (w/v) was prepared by dissolving of PVA in MilliQ Millipore water at 80 °C under constant mechanical stirring for 6 h. Besides the 50% (w/v) of GA was prepared by dissolving of GA in MilliQ Millipore water at 50 °C. Then, CS was dissolved in the acetic acid at room temperature to prepare 2% (w/v) CS solution. After that, the blend PVA/GA/CS solution was prepared by mixing of the PVA, GA and CS solution and which was stirred constantly using a mechanical stirrer for 15 min. Then, glycerol (1 g) was added and the resulting mixture, PVA/GA/CS composite became viscous and was homogenized under mechanical stirring for 30 min at 80 °C. Then the BPEO or GEO were added in different percentage (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50) into the PVA/GA/CS composite solution under stirring for 15 min and the mixed solutions were homogenized under high pressure in a PRIMIX-Homomixer Mark II.2.5 homogenizer with a pressure range of 30–300 bar and the process was repeated three times. Based on the homogenization ability, 10% of BPEO as well as GEO were fixed to make BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films. Then these film forming solutions were degassed in the vacuum drying oven (Rotek Vaccum Oven). The films were prepared by solution casting method and the mixed solutions onto the acrylic plates at 60 °C. The films were dried for 40 min at 50 °C and then peeled from the caster plates. The prepared BPEO and GEO incorporated composite films were marked as BPEO-PVA/GA/CS and GEO-PVA/GA/CS, respectively, as well as a control film was also prepared and marked as PVA/GA/CS which were preserved under relative humidity 50% at a temperature of about 25 °C for the additional analysis. A schematic illustration representing the preparation of PVA/GA/CS composite film with and without BPEO and GEO is shown in Fig. 1 ."
5,Characterization of prepared BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films,"2.4 Characterization of prepared BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films 2.4.1 Swelling degree and water solubility The swelling degree and water solubility were calculated according to the Akyuz et al. [35] with suitable modifications. The dried pieces of composite film (W1) were placed in 50 mL beakers with 30 mL of distilled water covered by plastic wraps, which were shaken in a thermostatic shaker at a speed of 30 rpm for gentle agitation at room temperature (28 ± 2 °C). After 24 h, the swollen films were taken out of the water and gently blotted with filter paper, weighted accurately (W2), the equation below was used to calculate the percentage of moisture gained. (1) Swelling degree % = W 2 − W 1 W 1 × 100 where W1 and W2 are the weight of the dried and swollen films (g) respectively. Consequently, the swollen film pieces were dried at 50 °C for 24 h and reweighed. The percentage of dissolved dry content in water was calculated by the following equation: (2) Water solubility % = W 1 − W 3 W 1 × 100 where W3 is the final weight (g) after drying. 2.4.2 Volatile mass fraction (VM) Approximately 25 mm × 25 mm of samples cut from the films and weighted before (Wa) and after (Wb) drying in an oven at 105 °C for 24 h to calculate the volatile mass fraction using the following equation: (3) Volatile mass fraction % = W a − W b W a × 100 2.4.3 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) The FTIR-ATR spectra recorded by JASCO ATR-FT/IR-4700 for PVA/GA/CS and BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 with 32 scans per samples. 2.4.4 X-ray diffraction The crystalline nature of the PVA/GA/CS and BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films were determined using X-ray diffraction pattern analysis (X'pert3 powder X-ray Diffractometer, United Kingdom) at ambient temperature using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 nm) over the 2θ range of 10 and 90° with a scanning speed of 1.2°/min. The prepared composite films were vacuum dried at 60 °C before the assay. 2.4.5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Scanning electron microscope (Vega3Tescan, Czech Republic) was employed to investigate the morphology of for PVA/GA/CS and BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films. The prepared films were placed in aluminum stubs using double sided carbon tape and sputter coated with gold. An accelerating voltage of 20 kV was used to scan the prepared composite films. 2.4.6 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) The thermal property of prepared PVA/GA/CS and BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films was estimated with differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) Q10 DSC equipment (Mettler Tolcdo DSC822e, India). Approximately 5 mg of each film was cut to small portions and placed on a small pan. The reference was an empty pan. The samples were heated from 0 to 400 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. 2.4.7 Thickness and mechanical properties The thickness of the films was determined using the arithmetic mean of five random measurements of their surface, including the center, the surroundings and the remaining random positions by using a digital thickness gauge (Mitutoyo model) and the results were expressed in mm. The mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation) of the films were determined with the help of H50KT (Tinius Olsen) a universal testing machine, according to the ATM D 882 method, ASTM, 1995 [36]. The experiments were carried out at a cross speed of 10 mm/min maintaining a room temperature of 27 ± 3 °C. The dimension of the samples was 50 mm × 10 mm and the results were the average of five measurements."
6,Retention and release study,"2.5 Retention and release study 2.5.1 The retention of BPEO and GEO during ambient storage The retention of BPEO and GEO during the film storage (25 °C, 50% relative humidity) was quantified by the method of Xu et al. [19] with suitable modifications. Both BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films 1 g of each were separately placed in a centrifuge tube with 30 mL of ethanol was added and vigorously stirred overnight at 25 °C. The solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min and then the supernatant was measured by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 35) with the absorbance at 310 nm for BPEO and 340 nm for GEO, which were calibrated by a standard curve obtained from standard BPEO and GEO solutions in ethanol. The loss of BPEO and GEO were calculated as the ratio of decreased amounts of BPEO and GEO in the films to the original amount of BPEO and GEO in the film forming solution. The measurements were taken once a day for a total of 14 days. Each sample was performed for five repetitions. 2.5.2 BPEO and GEO release profile In order to establish the release rate of the BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films, ethanol was chosen as a simulating solvent for various applications, particularly for food packaging and wound healing activities. The BPEO and GEO release towards simulant were quantified with the method modified from Xu et al. [19]. Both BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films 1 g was cut into equal parts and immersed in 30 mL ethanol with constant stirring at 50 rpm. Then 1 mL solution was pipetted at regular intervals and dissolved in ethanol to be measured the absorbance by the ultraviolet spectrophotometer at 310 nm for BPEO and 340 nm for GEO. All measurements were replicated five times."
7,Antimicrobial activity,"2.6 Antimicrobial activity The antimicrobial activity of the films was evaluated using disc diffusion method [37] against four bacterial species, which are Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium). Films (1 g) were initially immersed in 20 mL nutrient broth for 1 h to swell. The bacteria were preserved in the Müeller-Hinton agar (MH). Inocula were prearranged with accumulation and during the night civilization of the organism in MH broth to obtain an OD600.0.1. The cells were permitted to cultivate and attain the McFarland standard 0.5 i.e. approximately 108 CFU/mL. The suspensions were diluted to 1:1000 in MH broth to attain 106 CFU/mL. The same volume of bacterial suspension served as a blank control. The MH broth was used as a reference. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by measuring the zone of inhibition against the tested microorganism."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis The experiment determinations were completed in five replicates and the average values, mean and standard deviation are reported. Statistical comparisons were made by using one-way ANOVA followed by the Duncan's multiple range test by using SPSS 16.0 and the OriginPro 8.5 statistics program. Differences were observed as significant at 95% (p < 0.05)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Essential oil composition of black pepper and ginger,"3.1 Essential oil composition of black pepper and ginger The BPEO showed the presence of 29 major compounds are shown in Table 1 , which was caryophyllene (28.42%), followed by 3-carene (6.73%), d-limonene (6.13%), β-pinene (3.09%), β-selinene (3%), δ-elemene (2.88%) and humulene (2.11%). The availability of other constituents was lower than 2%. These results are in good agreement with the findings of Rouatbi et al. [38] and Myszka et al. [39], who reported that caryophyllene, careen and limonene are the main constituents of BPEO. However, there are few differences in main chemical compounds of BPEO were reported some studies [40,41] may be due to the genetic, age and stage of maturity, weather conditions, soil composition, plant organs, distillation conditions and some other factors. The GEO presented 40 major components (Table 2 ), and the main constituents were α-zingiberene (29.21%), β-cedrene (19.94%), α-curcumene (13.88%), β-bisbolene (11.54%), β-sesquiphellandrene (8.4%), E-β-Famesene (2.86%) and β-panasinsene (2.03%). The presence of other constituents was lower than 2%. Silva et al. [42] and Noori et al. [16] evaluated GEO and reported comparable composition, with α-zingiberene being the main organic constituent. Variations in the composition of GEO from Zingiber officinale Roscoe may be due to genetic, plant age, environmental composition and different extraction process. The compositions of both EOs, BPEO and GEO directly influences their biological activities as each compound has a specific ability."
11,Characterization of prepared PVA/GA/CS composite films with and without BPEO and GEO,"3.2 Characterization of prepared PVA/GA/CS composite films with and without BPEO and GEO 3.2.1 Swelling degree The swelling degree of the films is given in Table 3 . According to the results, the PVA/GA/CS composite film confirmed a high degree of swelling, this may be due to the hydrophilic nature of CS [19], PVA [8] and GA [37] which enhance the water uptake ability [8]. The incorporation of both EOs, BPEO and GEO significantly (P<0.05) decreased the swelling degree indicating that the films containing BPEO and GEO possessed a higher level of hydrophobic nature. The decrease in the swelling degree is probably due to the fact that the BPEO and GEO are able to decrease the tendency of the PVA/GA/CS composite film matrix to bind water and thus reduce the water uptake, as well as which reduced the number of available groups in the network that where capable of hydrogen bond formation with water molecules, thereby reducing the swelling degree [20]. Likewise, flaxseed oil incorporated soy protein-based films [43] and Zataria multiflora EO incorporated PVA based electrospun [8] reduced the swelling degree probably due to the reduction of interaction between water and film matrix. 3.2.2 Water solubility Water solubility is a main factor for various applications of the film, particularly packaging and wound dressing materials. The water solubility can be considered as an indicator to evaluate the stability of the films and water resistance, because the solubility of the films depends the type and concentration of the components as well their hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity indices. Consequently, hydrophilic components tend to increase the solubility values, whereas, hydrophobic components decrease the solubility [44,45]. The solubility of the BPEO and GEO with and without PVA/GA/CS composite films in distilled water at room temperature was investigated as a percentage, as given in Table 3. The prepared PVA/GA/CS composite film was found to have higher water solubility (47.99%) when compared with BPEO (29.37%) and GEO (31.97%) incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films due to the fact that both BPEO and GEO reacted effectively with the PVA/GA/CS composite matrix, it was reduced to entry of water molecules within the PVA/GA/CS composite matrix, moreover the number of hydrophilic groups were reduced. These results reveal that the water solubility of the films after incorporation of both EOs are considerably reduced up to 38 and 33% for BPEO-PVA/GA/CS and GEO-PVA/GA/CS composite films respectively, which are good indication to utilize the films as a food packaging materials, as well both BPEO-PVA/GA/CS and GEO-PVA/GA/CS composite films can be used to extend food stability by reducing exchange of moisture, O2 and CO2 between the food and the surrounding environment [46]. Furthermore, EOs could function to possibly emulsify the polymeric matrix via a filling effect and the results in a compact and continuous structure of BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite film. In addition, the presence of more hydrophobic components in both BPEO and GEO were found (Tables 1 and 2) to result in the destruction of hydrogen bonding between the PVA, GA and CS in the PVA/GA/CS composite film and their interactions may limit the hydrogen groups to form hydrophilic bonds with water and then lead to a decrease in the affinity of the film for water. 3.2.3 Volatile mass fraction Volatile mass fraction denotes to the percentage of film mass reduction in the initial weight of the film, as given in Table 3. The moisture content was the primary volatile component in the PVA/GA/CS composite film, which contained 16.82 ± 2.69%. Conversely, the content of volatile matters in both BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films containing not only moisture, but also the EOs were 11.45 ± 2.32% and 14.70 ± 1.78% for BPEO- PVA/GA/CS and GEO- PVA/GA/CS composite films respectively, which were lowered than the PVA/GA/CS composite film due to the strong interaction between the EOs and film matrix, which reduced the free volume in the film matrix, resulting in a slump in the film capacity for holding and capturing moisture. Therefore the amount of moisture volatilized above 100 °C was decreased, which ultimately led to the volatile content of BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films lower than that of PVA/GA/CS composite film. These results were similar to described by Li et al. [20] and Sahraee et al. [47]. 3.2.4 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) studies The FTIR spectra of BPEO, GEO, PVA/GA/CS composite film with and without BPEO and GEO shown in Fig. 2 . The FTIR spectrum of BPEO (Fig. 2(a)) consisted of the prominent absorption bands at 2957 cm−1, 2918 cm−1 and 2870 cm−1 for CH stretching vibration of methylene group, 1653 cm−1 for H-O-H bending, 1437 cm−1 for CH scissoring vibration, 1382 cm−1 and 1365 cm−1 for symmetrical deformation vibration of CH3, 863 cm−1 for CH deformation vibration and 786 cm−1 for SC absorption [14]. The absorption bands of GEO (Fig. 2(b)) at 1621 cm−1 and 1593 cm−1 were associated with CC stretching and the bands at 1462 cm−1 and 1339 cm−1 for stretching vibration of C=C-C=C. A vibration mode associated to –CH2 groups is presented in the GEO at 2879 cm−1 and CH bond stretching at 839 cm−1. Furthermore, the CO stretching is present with strong intensity at 1097 cm−1 [42,48]. The FTIR spectrum of PVA/GA/CS composite film (Fig. 2(c)) demonstrates peak at 3268 cm−1 which is attributed to NH and OH stretching vibration [8]. A band at 2916 cm−1 is related at CH stretching, which associated with the out of phase stretching of R-CH2-R [37], other peaks at 1652 cm−1, 1633 cm−1 and 1601 cm−1 are associated with amino characterization. Two small bands at 1560 cm−1 and 1537 cm−1 in amide region are attributed to the NH vibration [49]. A strong peak at 1414 cm−1 was derived from the symmetrical stretching vibration of the CO group and characteristic –OH in plane bending vibrations in CHOH [38,50,51]. The peaks at 1326 cm−1 and 1211 cm−1 are assigned to CH and CO bonds respectively [8]. The bands at 1033 cm−1 and 919 cm−1 correspond to the CO, CC and C-O-C stretching and C-O-H, CH bending modes [8,37]. Therefore, the prepared composite film is composed of all PVA, GA and CS compounds. On the other hand, the FTIR spectra of PVA/GA/CS composite films incorporated with BPEO and GEO were evaluated to specify whether the BPEO and GEO incorporation in the composite film structure. Based on the obtained results for the BPEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite film (Fig. 2(d)), it can be seen that beside the peaks at 3267 cm−1, 2927 cm−1, 1655 cm−1, 1329 cm−1, 1038 cm−1 and 918 cm−1, which manifest the presence of PVA, GA and CS in the composite film, three new peaks at 1439 cm−1, 1376 cm−1 and 846 cm−1 appeared which are attributed to typical bands of BPEO confirms the incorporation of BPEO into the PVA/GA/CS composite film [14]. The IR spectrum of GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite film (Fig. 2(e)) demonstrates peaks at 3284 cm−1, 2914 cm−1, 1655 cm−1, 1038 cm−1 and 919 cm−1, which noticeable the presence of PVA, GA and CS, whereas, other new peaks appear at 1415 cm−1, 1327 cm−1 and 842 cm−1 indicate the incorporation of GEO onto the PVA/GA/CS composite film [42,48]. 3.2.5 X-ray diffraction studies XRD analysis of PVA/GA/CS, BPEO-PVA/GA/CS and GEO-PVA/GA/CS are presented in Fig. 3 . The XRD pattern of PVA/GA/CS film showed a characteristic peak of mixture of the PVA, GA and CS around 20° (Fig. 3(a)), signifying the amorphous nature with significant crystallinity of PVA, GA and CS. After incorporation of BPEO (Fig. 3(b)) and GEO (Fig. 3(c)) into PVA/GA/CS composite films, the peak around 20° became broader and less intense, indicating disruption of PVA/GA/CS composite film structure [18,52]. Furthermore, the XRD spectra of the BPEO-PVA/GA/CS and GEO-PVA/GA/CS composite films show a new peak around 41°, which are attributed to the incorporation of BPEO and GEO into the PVA/GA/CS composite film respectively. 3.2.6 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies The scanning electron micrographs of BPEO and GEO incorporated and without the EO incorporation of PVA/GA/CS composite films are shown in Fig. 4 . The PVA/GA/CS composite film (Fig. 4(a)) showed a compact and smooth microstructure with cavities, which reflects the good compatibility of the three polymers of PVA, GA and CS. However, BPEO-PVA/GA/CS composite film (Fig. 4(b)) showed a hetero-structure in which BPEO droplets are trapped in the PVA/GA/CS network with increased roughness and the appearance of more cavities without cracks due to the hydrophobicity of BPEO in the PVA/GA/CS composite film and revealing incorporation of BPEO in the PVA/GA/CS film. Similarly, Li et al. [20] reported that the encapsulation of turmeric EO into CS films increased the heterogeneity and roughness of the CS films, likewise, Abdollahi et al. [53] also reported the same nature of behavior when the encapsulation of summer savory essential oil in carboxymethyl cellulose-agar biocomposite film. The SEM micrograph of GEO-PVA/GA/CS film is shown in Fig. 4(c). As can be observed, the surface of the film containing GEO was rougher than that of the PVA/GA/CS and also increased the coarseness of the film surface due to the migration of oil droplets towards the film surface and further volatilization of GEO. The volatilization of the GEO in addition to the evaporation of water resulted into irregular surface, which suggested that the structural rearrangement of PVA, GA and CS in the film matrix in the presence of GEO. Similar results were reported in earlier studies, when the incorporation of EOs in different edible films increased the coarseness of the films [54,55]. 3.2.7 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies Thermal properties of the PVA/GA/CS, BPEO-PVA/GA/CS and GEO-PVA/GA/CS films measured by DSC are presented in Fig. 5 . Three endothermic peaks were observed in all the prepared films. The first peak temperature values of the BPEO-PVA/GA/CS (Fig. 5(b)) and GEO- PVA/GA/CS (Fig. 5(c)) films were 3–8 °C higher than that of PVA/GA/CS film (Fig. 5(a)), which indicates that there was weak molecular interaction between the both BPEO and GEO and the PVA/GA/CS matrix. These slightly higher peak temperature changes in EO containing films are due to the lower residual moisture content than the PVA/GA/CS film [54,56]. Furthermore, the nature of EOs is affected the thermal behavior, so that the BPEO-PVA/GA/CS and GEO-PVA/GA/CS films showed slightly higher peak temperature than the PVA/GA/CS indicating to their inherent difference to interact with hydrophobicity. The second and third endothermic peaks were observed at ~206 °C and ~292 °C in all the films, without any significant difference, except second endothermic peak of BPEO- PVA/GA/CS, indicated that the degradation of the film matrixes / melting point temperature of CS, GA and PVA [8,37,49]. These observations are well in agreement with good water repelling ability of both EOs incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films due to the well entrapment of BPEO and GEO onto the PVA/GA/CS composite films. 3.2.8 Thickness and mechanical properties The incorporation of BPEO and GEO into the PVA/GA/CS composite film increased the thickness, when compared with PVA/GA/CS composite film (Table 4 ) due to the entrapment of BPEO and GEO micro droplets into the PVA/GA/CS composite matrix, thereby increase the compactness of the PVA/GA/CS matrix structure. Similar results were reported with the addition of licorice EO onto carboxymethyl xylan film [57] and corn starch containing orange EO [45]. The CS alone has the good film forming ability, however, PVA was added to improve the mechanical property with flexible nature of the composite films. The PVA is one of the preferred achievable compound for the fabrication of composites to improve the interfacial strength and mechanical performance with flexible nature [58–60]. Mechanical properties of the films particularly, the tensile strength and elongation are the important indicators of the applicability of films. Hypothetically, incorporation of EO is anticipated to interrupt polymeric network in the film, which would then result in a decrease in tensile strength and an increase in flexibility [61]. The mechanical properties of with and without BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films were given in Table 4. Both BPEO and GEO incorporated films showed somewhat lower tensile strength values 7.08 ± 0.26 MPa and 8.75 ± 0.37 MPa, respectively compared to PVA/GA/CS composite film (11.81 ± 0.34), which indicates to fact that the incorporation of BPEO and GEO in the PVA/GA/CS composite film faintly weakened polymeric network [54]. This can be explained by the heterogeneous film structures with increased roughness and the appearance of more cavities (Fig. 4(b)) and more coarseness nature (Fig. 4(c)) due to the incorporation of BPEO and GEO respectively. Furthermore, stronger intermolecular interaction of PVA/GA/CS composite film can be partially replaced by the EO interactions generating more flexibility within the PVA/GA/CS composite film. On the other hand, elongation increased when the incorporation of BPEO and GEO onto the PVA/GA/CS composite film due to their plasticising effects. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the films are affected by various factors, such as nature and structure of the polymers used, and the nature and content of EO and their droplet size and their distribution [43,54]."
12,Retention and release study,"3.3 Retention and release study EOs are volatile and could suffer a great loss during the evaporation of film formation and subsequent storage. The both EOs, BPEO and GEO in PVA/GA/CS composite films were shown significant retention during ambient storage, which is shown in Fig. 6 . The results indicated that the BPEO much higher retention than the GEO form the PVA/GA/CS composite matrix that might be due to the chemical interactions between the EOs and composite matrix. Similar results were observed when incorporating cinnamon EO in CS and GA based film [19] and soy bean oil and cinnamon bark oil encapsulated in CS film [62]. The release study of both BPEO and GEO from both EOs incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films was carried out for 48 h at pH 7. The release rate of both BPEO and GEO is divided into two stages based on the release rate (Fig. 7 ). The initial burst release was observed for the first 18 h, both EOs, BPEO and GEO were released up to 69.4% and 74.6%, respectively (Fig. 7 (insert)), due to the rapid discharge of EOs from the thin matrix of composite films. The second stage showed a slow release till 48 h where both BPEO and GEO were released up to 70.4% and 75.9%, respectively (Fig. 7) due to the migration of EOs from the deep matrix of film to the surface, because of BPEO as well as GEO were connected and implanted in the cross linking network structure of the film matrix made by PVA, GA and CS. When the films were immersed in ethanol solution, a really fast release of both BPEO and GEO happened at the initial contact time, latterly the release rate of both EOs decreased during the rest of the period, which could be attributed to the easy and fast penetration of ethanol into the composite film matrixes. The diffusion of EOs is also favoured through the composite film matrix due to the swelling process, producing a more open structure and consequently increasing the EOs mobility [62,63]."
13,Antimicrobial study,"3.4 Antimicrobial study The prepared PVA/GA/CS composite film showed a slight antibacterial activity against all tested organisms, which is likely due to the presence of CS [49] and GA [37]. Both BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films showed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in antibacterial activity, when compared with PVA/GA/CS composite film (Table 5 ). Among the EOs incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films, BPEO-PVA/GA/CS composite film showed a significant (P < 0.05) greatest inhibition zones (20.43 ± 2.04 mm, 18.73 ± 1.76 mm, 16.82 ± 1.27 mm and 17.43 ± 1.36 mm for B. cereus, S. aureus, E. coli and S. typhimurium respectively) among the composite films, however, GEO-PVA/GA/CS composite film also registered significant inhibition zones (17.83 ± 1.77 mm, 16.34 ± 1.54 mm, 14.59 ± 1.14 mm and 15.21 ± 1.74 mm for B. cereus, S. aureus, E. coli and S. typhimurium respectively). The increasing effect of antibacterial activity also demonstrates that the incorporation of BPEO and GEO onto the PVA/GA/CS composite film, is an efficient method for protecting and increasing the stability and sustain the release of their bioactive compounds. The sustain release of the EOs molecules allows their continuous availability and destruction to the cytoplasmic membrane [19,64,65]. The results also indicated that a representative for gram positive bacteria B. cereus and S. aureus were more sensitive to the tested composite films than the gram negative bacteria composing of lipopolysaccharides and proteins better tolerates the tested composite films containing BPEO and GEO. Moreover, the O-side chain of the lipopolysaccharide of the Gram negative bacteria have a hydrophobic molecules to enter the bilayer [14,66]. These results were also confirmed by the earlier studies, such as Sayyad et al. [67] and Noori et al. [16] were reported that the antibacterial activity of EOs against Gram positive is drastically higher than Gram negative bacteria."
14,Conclusion,"In this study, BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films were successfully prepared by the solvent casting method, which could be a good alternative for the traditional food packaging and wound healing materials. The BPEO-PVA/GA/CS composite film showed a hetero-structure with entrapment of BPEO droplets with increased roughness and the appearance of more cavities without cracks due to the hydrophobicity of BPEO, whereas, the surface of the PVA/GA/CS composite film containing GEO was rough surface with increased coarseness due to the migration of oil droplets towards the film surface. The BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films were considerable resistant to breakage and more flexible than the PVA/GA/CS composite film with improved heat stability. Both EOs incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films were registered considerable retention and release rate of respective EO, among them BPEO-PVA/GA/CS composite film showed much better retention and release rate than the GEO-PVA/GA/CS composite film. The BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films were significantly inhibited the growth of B. cereus, S. aureus, E. coli and S. typhimurium. The obtained results have demonstrated that both BPEO and GEO incorporated PVA/GA/CS composite films are promising alternatives to wound dressing and food packaging materials."
