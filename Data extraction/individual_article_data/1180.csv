0,Introduction,"Due to the global environment worsened by excessive use of fossil fuel, sustainable biomass resources have been growing more and more importance as partial alternatives of fossil resources (Benemann, 1996). Cellulosic biomass is an abundant renewable resource on earth. Effective use of corncobs by biological processing to obtain bio-hydrogen is an attractive way of producing clean fuel (Benemann, 1996). Hydrogen, which is a clean and storable energy carrier, is accepted as a potential substitute for fossil fuels (Das and Veziroglu, 2001). Bioconversion of cellulose-rich wastes into hydrogen by natural mixed anaerobic microorganisms has been investigated ardently recently (Chen et al., 2008). For instance, Fan et al. (2006) reported that the H2 yield by using acid-pretreated wheat straw was 68.1mL H2/g-TVS. During all the hydrogen fermentations, hydrogen production habitually accompanies with producing volatile fatty acids (VFAs), such as acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid. Photosynthetic non-sulfur bacteria (PNS) can make good use of organic acids and alcohols as carbon source to produce hydrogen under light irradiation in anaerobic condition and show high conversion efficiency in theory (Fang et al., 2005). Fang et al. (2005) reported that a maximum hydrogen yield, 2.5mol-H2/mol-acetate and 3.7mol-H2/mol-butyrate could be achieved by Rhodobacter capsulatus. Thus, the effluents of dark-fermentation, which are mainly composed of organic acids, could be used as the substrate of PNS to produce hydrogen. In previous reports, glucose (Redwood and Macaskie, 2006), sucrose (Tao et al., 2007), were used as the substrate in the two-step fermentation process, and the hydrogen yield was improved remarkably compared with that of dark-fermentation. So far, in all publications of bio-hydrogen production, the pollution problem of the effluent from dark-fermentation was never really considered. And no information is available on hydrogen production from corncob wastes via dark-fermentation or photo-fermentation in literatures. In light of the above background, we attempt to utilize abundant corncob wastes to produce hydrogen by integrating dark- and photo-fermentation."
1,Methods,
2,Seed microflora,"2.1 Seed microflora Hydrogen-producing microflora in dark-fermentation tests was obtained from dairy manure in the suburb of Xi’an city in this study. In order to inhibit the bioactivity of hydrogen consumers, dairy manure was spread into a stainless steel griddle pan to a depth of 1cm and dried in an infrared oven at 112°C for 5h (Tao et al., 2007). The photosynthetic bacteria used in the photo-fermentation were R. sphaeroides isolated from the sedimentation tank of Bei Shi Qiao sewage treatment plant in Xi’an city."
3,Pretreatment of corncob,"2.2 Pretreatment of corncob Corncob was hydrolyzed with boiling diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl) in glass flasks for 0.5h. The hydrolyzed corncob mixtures were adjusted to 4.80 with 1M NaOH. Commercial cellulase (ChengDe TianFeng Co., 100 U/g (CMC), U: μmol glucose/min/g) was added into the mixture for enzymolysis. Mixtures of corncob and cellulase in flasks were stirred by magnetic stirrer in 50°C water bath. Enzymolysis of raw corncob without HCl pretreatment was also executed directly under the same condition described above."
4,Fermentation procedure,"2.3 Fermentation procedure 2.3.1 Dark-fermentation process The batch experiments were performed in 600mL flasks as batch reactors. A 250mL mixture, which was composed of heat-shocked manure, the pretreated corncob, and 6mL of nutrient stock solution (Fan et al., 2006), was filled into each reactor. The initial pH was adjusted to 7.0 by 1M NaOH or HCl solutions (Fan et al., 2006). These reactors were flushed with argon gas to obtain anaerobic environment and incubated at 36±1°C on thermostatic water bath equipped with magnetic stirrer to provide better blending. Hydrogen producing tests under optimum condition were carried out in a 25L continuous stirring tank reactor, in which twenty liters of mixture composed of 200g pretreated corncob, nutrient stock solution and seed microflora was filled. All of the tests were repeated in triplicate for reliability of the results. 2.3.2 Photo-fermentation process R. sphaeroides was pre-incubated for 48h in the following medium (in per liter): NH4Cl 1.0g, MgCl2·6H2O 0.12g, CaCl2 0.14g, EDTA 0.06g, KH2PO4 0.5g, K2HPO4·3H2O 0.5g, iron citrate 0.03g, Na2S·9H2O 0.038g, NaHCO3 0.5g; trace element solution (g/L, ZnCl2 0.28, MnCl2·4H2O 0.4, H3BO3 0.24, CoCl2·6H2O 0.8, CuCl2·2H2O 0.08, Na2MoO4·2H2O 0.16, FeSO4·7H2O 0.4, EDTA 0.4), 4mL, vitamin solution (g/L, biotin 0.4, nicotine 2, p-aminobenzoic acid 2, vitamin B12 0.1, thiamine 2) 4mL/L. A 248mL dark-fermentation effluent and 1mL microelement solution and 1mL vitamin solution were mixed in 320mL photo-reactors. The photo-reactors were irradiated by 15W tungsten lights and the reaction liquid was stirred by magnetic force stirrer. Temperature of these reactors was controlled at 35±0.5°C by a water bath. All of the batch tests were repeated in triplication for reliability of the results."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Volumes of the biogas were measured with volumetric flowmeter and then calculated into that in standard condition (273.15K, 1atm). And components of biogas were analyzed with a gas chromatograph (GC, Beifen Co., Ltd. Model, SP-2100) equipped with a thermal conduct detector and a 4m stainless column filled with Hayesep padding. Concentrations of VFAs in the liquid samples were analyzed with a gas chromatograph (Beifen Co., Ltd. Model, SP-3420) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column coated with terephthalic acid modified PEG (AT.FFAP). Transparence of the centrifuged dark-fermentation and photo-fermentation effluent was obtained with a spectrophotometer (Hitachi, UV-4100). COD values of the liquid samples were measured with COD equipment (Lovibond, ET99722). Reducing sugar content of the corncob was analyzed by anthrone–sulfuric method (Grandy et al., 2000). The irradiation energy of the light between 300nm and 1000nm was measured by a photometer (FZ-A, Beijing Normal University Optician). The energy output of the photo-reactor was calculated by the molar enthalpies of hydrogen combustion, which is 286kJ/mol-H2. Then the conversion efficiency of light energy (LCE) was defined according to the method addressed in Nakada et al. (1999)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrolyzing corncob with hydrochloric acid and enzyme,"3.1 Hydrolyzing corncob with hydrochloric acid and enzyme Fig. 1 a depicts the effect of the cellulase concentrations on hydrolyzing raw corncob into reducing sugar and hydrogen production. It shows that the content of reducing sugar increased rapidly from 0.03±0.04g/g to 0.21±0.02g/g when the cellulase concentration increased from 0.5U/g to 6.5U/g. The contents of reducing sugar were almost constant when the cellulase concentration increased further, which suggested that higher cellulase concentration had little effective on increasing the concentration of reducing sugar further. Cumulative hydrogen yields increased from 26.3±2.6mL/g to 49.4±2.2mL/g. With the further increase of cellulase concentration, it reduced sharply to 13.3±3mL/g, and then kept constant. These results suggest some unknown inhibitors somehow existed in the enzymolysis. Low hydrogen yield was explained to be the result of low efficiency on hydrolyzing cellulose and semicellulose (Liu et al., 2003). Because of complex chemical structure of corncob, such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, corncob cannot be digested efficiently by bacteria, which results in the content of reducing sugar is quite low in the raw corncob. That is the reason why the followed hydrogen production stayed at a low level. In order to hydrolyze the corncob more efficiently, an acid pretreatment was employed to hydrolyze cellulose and hemicelluloses before enzymolysis. Fig. 1b depicts the effects of HCl concentration on hydrogen yield with fixed initial pH 7.0 and at the substrate concentration 10g/L. As shown in Fig. 1b, the cumulative hydrogen yield increased remarkably with the increase of HCl concentration in the range of 0–1.5%. Maximum hydrogen yield of 120.3±5.3mL/g was obtained from corncob hydrolyzed by enzymolysis after being pretreated with 1.5% HCl. Hydrogen yield gradually declined to 43.6mL H2/g by increasing HCl concentration from 1.5% to 4%. The reducing sugar yield increased from 0.21±0.02g/g to 0.24±0.02g/g with the increase of HCl concentration in the range of 0–2%, and then decreased to 0.19±0.02g/g when the HCl concentrations were in the range of 3–5%. Although higher acid concentration is in favor of hydrolyzing the substrate, higher acid concentration will decompose reducing sugar much faster and lead to produce more furfural, which is an inhibitor for bacteria growth (Basta and Houssni, 2003). Furthermore, the high concentration of Cl− anion in the batch tests heavily inhibited the growth of hydrogen production bacteria."
8,Hydrogen production by dark-fermentation,"3.2 Hydrogen production by dark-fermentation As described above, the optimal hydrolyzing condition on corncob is 1.5% HCl and 6.5U/g cellulase concentration, respectively. On this condition, 2.60±0.46L hydrogen was produced from 200g raw corncobs. And after being pretreated with HCl and cellulase, the hydrogen yield was 24.1±1.3L (120.5±6.5mL H2/g-corncob), which is 826.9% of that from raw corncob, and the maximal hydrogen production rate was up to 150mL/(Lh). The amount of reducing sugar in 200g corncobs was 7.8g before pretreatment and up to 48.4g after pretreatment. Supposing hydrogen was produced from fermenting reducing sugar, the conversion molar ratio between reducing sugar and hydrogen was 2.68 before pretreatment and 4 after pretreatment. However, fermenting 48.4g glucose produced merely 12.40±0.94L hydrogen, and the molar ratio between hydrogen and glucose was 2.05. This result suggests that the pretreatment on corncob enhanced hydrogen yield not only by increasing reducing sugar, but also by degrading the structure of corncob. Cellulose and hemicellulose can be decomposed into oligosaccharides (Akpinar et al., 2009), which are hard detected by anthrone–sulfuric method (Grandy et al., 2000). But the mixed bacteria have the ability to digest these oligosaccharides from pretreated corncob to produce hydrogen. Thus, hydrogen yield was markedly enhanced by hydrochloric acid pretreatment for a lot of oligosaccharides produced. Analysis of the dark-fermentation effluent showed that the VFAs were composed of 32.46±0.52mM acetate, 26.4±0.58mM butyrate, 2.81±0.15mM propionate, and trace amounts of ethanol, butyl alcohol, valeric acid, and iso-butyric acid."
9,Hydrogen production by photo-fermentation,"3.3 Hydrogen production by photo-fermentation During the culture period of 275h, 6182±382mL hydrogen was produced by R. sphaeroides from per liter culture, and the maximal hydrogen production rate was 32mL H2/(Lh). The maximal and average efficiency of light energy conversion in the photo-fermentation process was 4.36% and 3.06%. Most of the VFAs were removed and the total COD removal efficiency was up to 90±1%. The concentration of acetate, butyrate and propionate were decreased to be 0.46±0.04mM, 0.20±0.03mM and 0mM after photo-fermentation process. These results indicate that 98.6±0.1% of acetate, 99.3±0.1% of butyrate and 100% of propionate were consumed by R. sphaeroides. The color of the dark-fermentation effluent was brown and absorbed considerable part of light shorter than 800nm as detected by ultraviolet spectra (data not shown). That indicates there were some kinds of colored compounds in the dark-fermentation effluent. After photo-fermentation process, transmittance of the liquid was improved remarkably as shown in the spectra between 300nm and 800nm. This result suggests that the concentration of colored compounds was digested by photo-fermentation process. This capacity makes this strain efficient on treating this kind of wastewater not only by digesting VFAs, but also by digesting colored compounds. Inoculation concentration of R. sphaeroides in the photo-fermentation reactor was 0.30±0.05g dcw/L (dcw stands for dry cell weight). After being cultivated for 80h, the cell concentration achieved and stabilized at about 1.82±0.14g dcw/L. The high reproduction propagation rate and high concentration of the bacteria suggested that the dark-fermentation effluent was appropriate for bacteria growth. And the shielding effect of the color effluent has little effect on the bacteria growth. In the whole photo-fermentation process, the hydrogen yield was 713.6±44.1mL H2/g-COD, and the conversion efficiency from substrate to product was estimated to be about 51%. A hydrogen yield of 6182±382mL/L-effluent was obtained in photo-fermentation. This result suggests that 20L of the dark-fermentation effluent could be converted into 123.64±7.64L or 5.52±0.34mol hydrogen. Combining with the dark-fermentation, 200g of corncob powders could be converted into 6.59±0.40mol hydrogen by the two-step fermentation process. Supposing 200g corncob was equal to 1mol glucose (the calorific value of 200g corncob is approximate to that of 1mol glucose), and the theoretical hydrogen production by the two-step process was 12mol H2. Thus, the apparent conversion efficiency from corncob to hydrogen was estimated to be 54.9%. The overall energy recovery was estimated to be 58.9% by calculating the calorific value of corncob and hydrogen. Furthermore, the COD value removal efficiency of the dark-fermentation effluent was 90% by photo-fermentation."
10,Conclusions,"The feasibility of converting corncob into high-yield hydrogen in a two-step process with integrating dark- and photo-fermentation was demonstrated in this study. The corncob pretreated by diluted hydrochloric acid and cellulase can be digested efficiently by the microbes from heat-shocked dairy manure. The effluent of dark-fermentation from corncob is a good substrate for hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria. Since photosynthetic bacteria is high efficient on removing the COD value of the dark-fermentation effluent, the two integrated processes can enhance hydrogen yield and reduce pollution."
