0,Introduction,"β-Amino trifluoromethyl alcohol 2 is a key intermediate in the production of AE-3763, 1 a human neutrophile elastase (HNE) inhibitor (Fig. 1 ) developed by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. Generally, β-amino perfluoroalkyl alcohols are valuable compounds as intermediates for protease inhibitors and synthetic methods for these alcohols have been developed. 2 One of the most frequently used methods consists of nucleophilic addition to enantiopure α-amino aldehyde derivatives, such as N-protected l-phenylalaninal. In this route, a trifluoromethyl trimethylsilane (TMSCF3, the Ruppert Reagent), 3 which is an efficient trifluoromethylating reagent of carbonyl compounds, is added to N-protected α-amino aldehydes in the presence of tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) or CsF to give a diastereomeric mixture of β-amino trifluoromethyl alcohols in moderate yields. 4 However, this method cannot be applied to l-valinal due to steric hindrance at the isopropyl group. Several methods for the synthesis of 2 have been reported. 5 However, these methods consist of many steps and some of them require resolution leading to very low yields. In 2004, Andres et al. 6 reported the diastereoselective synthesis of N-dibenzyl-β-amino trifluoromethyl alcohol from N-dibenzyl-α-amino aldehyde in moderate yield and 84:16 diastereomeric ratios of the (2S,3S)- and (2R,3S)-isomer. However, this method requires the isolation of each diastereomer using flash chromatography, which is impractical on an industrial scale. We therefore decided to develop a new, simpler method for the synthesis of the optically active 2. Schofield et al. reported the synthesis of compound 3 7 from l-valine (Fig. 2 ). However, their efforts to convert 3 to 5 using acid hydrolysis were unsuccessful. We also attempted with no success the acid hydrolysis of compound 4, in which the Boc-group of 3 was converted to a Cbz-group at the N-terminal protecting group. We considered that the reduction of compound 4 followed by alkaline hydrolysis would provide the desired (3S)-3-amino-1,1,1-trifluoro-4-methylpentan-2-ol 2. Based on these findings, we focused our efforts on the conversion of compound 4 to 2."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Reduction of compound 4,"2.1 Reduction of compound 4 The N-Cbz-protected 5-hydroxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3-oxazolidine 4 was prepared as a single isomer at the C-5 position in good yield according to Schofield’s procedure, 7 with a minor modification. Reduction of compound 4 using sodium borohydride in ethanol at 0°C led to a mixture of (2S,3S)-isomer 6a and (2R,3S)-isomer 6b in 55:45 ratio as confirmed by HPLC. Complete deprotection of the N-hydroxymethyl group by alkaline hydrolysis gave the (2S,3S)-isomer 7a, the by-product 8b, 8 benzyl alcohol, and another product without the (2R,3S)-isomer 7b (Fig. 3 ). We therefore decided to investigate the mechanism underlying the production of the by-product. The reduction of compound 4 using sodium borohydride provided compounds 6a and 6b in almost equal amounts. In the case of compound 6a, the isopropyl group and trifluoromethyl group of the resultant product 8a are located on the same side. Due to the steric repulsion of the isopropyl group and trifluoromethyl group, it was thought that the nucleophilic reaction toward the carbonyl group of compound 6a did not occur. In contrast, the isopropyl group and trifluoromethyl group of 8b, which was formed from compound 6b, are located on the opposite side, suggesting that the by-products would be produced by nucleophilic reaction toward the carbonyl group followed by an intramolecular ring-closing reaction. Therefore, we considered that an improvement in the stereoselective reduction of compound 4 might provide the desired 7a in high yield. (Fig. 4 )"
3,Stereoselective reduction of compound 4,"2.2 Stereoselective reduction of compound 4 Next, we examined the solvent effect on using sodium borohydride as the reductive reagent. Since compounds 6a and 6b were too unstable to isolate, the degree of stereoselectivity was determined by HPLC. As a result, the degree of stereoselectivity was improved by using a bulky solvent, such as tert-butyl alcohol, tetrahydrofuran, or 2-propanol, and the desired (2S,3S)-6a was formed as the major component with (2R,3S)-6b as the minor one. In contrast, the degree of stereoselectivity was adversely affected by using a solvent containing water and the undesired (2R,3S)-6b was formed as the major component with (2S,3S)-6a as the minor one (Table 1 ). From these results, it was considered that compound 4 formed an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the N-hydroxyl methyl group and the trifluoromethyl ketone. Therefore, we decided to use zinc chloride for the chelate formation with compound 4a so that the conformation of compound 4a remains strongly fixed. Based on the above-mentioned results, we examined the possibility of stereoselective reduction with other reducing agents such as NaBH4–CeCl3, LiBHEt3, DIBAH, Vitride, LiBH4, and Zn(BH4)2, but no significant effect on the stereoselectivity was observed. However, a remarkable improvement in the stereoselectivity was observed when using zinc chloride and sodium borohydride (Table 2 ). We have not yet investigated the mechanism for the high stereoselectivity, but it was assumed that zinc cation was chelated by compound 4a, and so the conformation of compound 4a remains strongly fixed. Optimization of the reaction conditions was carried out for the stereoselective reduction of (2S,3S)-6a, and treatment of compound 4 with 1equiv of zinc chloride and 2equiv of sodium borohydride in tert-butyl methyl ether at room temperature gave, after alkaline hydrolysis, the corresponding (2S,3S)-7a in good chemical yield and excellent stereoselectivity (>90%). In addition, crude compound 7a could be purified by recrystallization from heptane–IPE (3:1), and so our new method did not require the use of column chromatography. This new method was applicable to an industrial-scale synthesis. The synthesis, represented in Scheme 1 , started with the Cbz-protection at N-terminal of l-Val followed by formylation to give the known oxazolidin-5-one 10 9 in excellent yield. The addition of TMS–CF3 to oxazolidin-5-one 10 followed by deprotection of the TMS group by methanol provided compound 4 in excellent yield. Finally, stereoselective reduction of compound 4 using zinc chloride and sodium borohydride in tert-butyl methyl ether followed by alkaline hydrolysis provided, after purification by recrystallization from heptane–IPE (3:1), the desired (2S,3S)-7a as a white crystalline powder in good chemical yield and excellent stereoselectivity (>99% de). The absolute configurations of (2S,3S)-7a and (2R,3S)-7b were determined by measurement of the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) difference spectrum for compounds 12a and 12b, which were converted from 7a and 7b (Scheme 2 ). When a weak radiofrequency wave was radiated at the hydrogen of compounds 12a and 12b at the C-4 position, the NOE difference spectrum between the 4-hydrogen and the 5-hydrogen of compound 12a was determined as 12.2% while for compound 12b, it was determined as 2.6%. In addition, the coupling constant between the 4-hydrogen and the 5-hydrogen of compound 12a was observed at 7.9Hz and the one for compound 12b was observed at 3.5Hz. From these findings, it is indicated that the 4-hydrogen and the 5-hydrogen of compound 12a had a cis-configuration and the absolute structure of 7a was the (2S,3S)-isomer. On the other hand, compound 12b had a trans-configuration and the absolute structure of 7b was the (2R,3S)-isomer. 10"
4,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we have synthesized in this study chiral β-amino trifluoromethyl alcohol (2S,3S)-7a, which is a key intermediate in the production of AE-3763, by stereoselective reduction of compound 4 prepared from l-valine, followed by alkaline hydrolysis. The synthesized (2S,3S)-7a was obtained in excellent yield, while our method did not require the use of column chromatography. As this new method can be applied on an industrial scale, it allows the industrial synthesis of AE-3763."
