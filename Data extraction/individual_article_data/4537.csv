0,Introduction,"Biodegradable polymer-based composite materials reinforced with naturally derived fillers, especially cellulose, are becoming increasingly important due to their interesting properties and diverse applications [1–5]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a biocompatible, non-toxic and biodegradable synthetic polymer with good film-forming properties, high crystallinity, flexibility, good chemical stability, and water-solubility [6–9]. Owing to the presence of hydroxyl groups on its macromolecular chains, PVA can promote the formation of hydrogen bonds with cellulosic functional groups. Therefore, the incorporation of cellulosic charge within PVA matrix is suitable to achieve enhanced properties [3,4]. Nevertheless, these materials still have certain disadvantages of surface properties such as low hardness and low abrasion resistance, which limit their applications [10,11]. A frequently used method to modify the surface properties of polymers is the application of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) layers. Here, the carbon is π and σ bound containing sp2 as well as sp3 clustered connections. The sp2 clusters are limited to short chains embedded in a sp3 matrix of carbon and hydrogen. The physical properties of the surfaces can be controlled by varying the plasma parameters, the gas used and the amount of hydrogen atoms in the plasma that crosslink the subsurface of the layer [12–16]. The resulting ratio of sp2 to sp3 hybridized carbons directly determines the properties of the layer. Diamond-like properties such as high hardness, chemical inertness or high electrical resistance are caused by a high sp3 to sp2 ratio [12]. If the sp3 to sp2 ratio is reduced, a graphite-like layer is obtained which is less robust and has improved electrical conductivity [12]. The change in chemical composition affects the overall wettability resp. contact angle behaviour of the deposited carbon layer. In addition, the layer thickness also determines the ratio of sp2 to sp3 as reported for several polymers and biopolymers [11,17–21]. A widely used process for depositing such a-C:H layers is chemical vapour deposition (CVD), which can be additionally supported by the use of radio frequency induced plasma (RF-PECVD) [12,16,19,22]. The RF-PECVD process has the advantage that it operates at low temperatures and can also coat non-conductive substrates [12,17]. In the present study, a-C:H layers of 50 and 100 nm are realized on pure and with cellulose microfibers reinforced PVA (PVA/CMF) using the RF-PECVD technique and acetylene plasma as carbon source. The aim is to investigate how the fibre affects the a-C:H layer growth on the polymer and whether the resulting layers differ significantly. The surface morphology of deposited carbon layers was investigated ex-situ by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) and surface sensitive synchrotron X-ray based techniques as near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to study their chemical composition. In addition, contact angle measurements (CA) were performed to evaluate the relationship between sp2/sp3 ratios on a macroscopic scale."
1,Experimental section,
2,Samples preparation,"2.1 Samples preparation Cellulose microfibers (CMF), neat PVA and 5 wt% CMF reinforced PVA (PVA/CMF) films were prepared as described in our previous work [9]. Briefly, CMF were extracted from ground Juncus plant stems using prewashed with distilled water, alkali-treatment with 4 wt% NaOH solution followed by bleaching treatment with a solution made up of equal parts (v:v) of acetate buffer (pH 4.8) (27 g NaOH and 75 mL glacial acetic acid, diluted to 1 L of distilled water) and aqueous sodium chlorite (1.7 wt% NaClO2 in water). Resulting in CMF with an average microfiber diameter of 3.5 ± 1.3 μm and a crystallinity index of 75%. The solvent-casting method was used for the preparation of neat PVA and CMF reinforced PVA (PVA/CMF) composite films. Thus, PVA powder was dissolved in distilled water; meanwhile, an aqueous suspension containing the desired amount 5 wt% of CMF was prepared and ultrasonicated for 5 min and added to PVA solution, resulting in 5 wt% CMF filled PVA mixture. The obtained mixture was mixed for 30 min at room temperature (RT), then poured onto Petri dishes and air-dried in laboratory hood at room temperature for 72 h to evaporate the water. Neat PVA film was also prepared according to the same process but without the addition of CMF."
3,Coating process,"2.2 Coating process For the coating of the samples, PVA and PVA/CMF samples were fixed on a vacuum-suitable aluminum sample holder and placed in a high-vacuum chamber. The coating in the process chamber is realized with a high frequency (HF, 13.65 MHz) plasma source (Copra DN 400, CCR GmbH, Troisdorf, Germany) [22]. For the activation and cleaning of the sample surface, all samples were pretreated with an O2 plasma (RT, pressure 1 Pa, flux 65 sccm/min, power 200 W, active plasma duration 10 min) before carbon coating [11,18–21,23,24]. After the O2 plasma treatment, the polymer samples were treated with an C2H2 plasma (RT, pressure 0.65 Pa, flux 65 sccm/min, power 107 W) resulting in the a-C:H layers [18,19,23,24]. The deposition rate is about 10 nm/min and approximately constant over time [23]. A smaller variation is present during the initial growth. No external BIAS was applied for the process, but a SELF-BIAS of −20 V (average value) develops on the sample during the coating process. In previous studies by Kleinen et al. with the setup used here, ion energies between 15 eV and 25 eV and current densities between 0.1 and 0.2 were determined μA‧cm−1 [17,25,26]. The entire process is described in detail elsewhere [25,26]. By doubling the coating time from 5 to 10 min two different a-C:H layer thicknesses of 50 nm and 100 nm can be achieved. The distance between plasma source and samples was kept at 275 mm during the entire plasma process [23]. By placing the sample surface directly in front of the plasma source, r-type DLC coating was obtained [18,19,24], which has a higher degree of cross-linked sp3 carbon centres caused by a high number of subplantation processes present in the coating [23]. The coating parameters also ensure that the temperature of the substrate never exceeds 40 °C and that all effects are not caused by melting of the substrate [18]. In order to be able to determine the coating thickness afterwards, additional silicon wafers (Silicon Materials, Kaufering, Germany), one half of each one was covered with aluminum foil, were mounted on the aluminum sample holders. The thickness of the applied layer was determined with a profilometer (Dektak 3, Veeco Instruments Inc., Plainview, NY, USA)."
4,Surface topography and wettability,"2.3 Surface topography and wettability The surface topography of the samples was examined by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM, Omicron nanoTechnology GmbH, Taunusstein, Germany). The AFM was operated in contact mode with standard silicon nitride PNP-TR cantilevers (NanoAndMore GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) at RT and ambient air conditions. To avoid tip sample convolution and tip blend the tips were regularly checked with cellulose acetate replica (Pelco, calibration specimen for atomic force microscopy, 607-AFM) of a 2.160 lines/mm waffle pattern diffraction grating. The measuring range was 5 μm × 5 μm. All measurements were performed at least at three different positions on the samples to ensure that the measurements were performed correctly and that no image errors occurred. To investigate the surface wettability of the different samples, contact angle measurements were performed. Therefore, the sessile drop technique was performed on a contact angle goniometer (OCA15EC, Dataphysics Instruments GmbH, Filderstadt, Germany) at room temperature and in ambient air. A dosing needle deposits a drop of water of HPLC quality (CHEMSOLUTE®) with a volume of 1 μL on the sample surface. Afterwards the contact angles left and right of the drops are measured. The measurements were repeated at least at five different locations on each sample surface to check the homogeneity and to determine the mean value."
5,Chemical composition,"2.4 Chemical composition To investigate the binding states and chemical composition of the carbon layers, both infrared based DRIFT spectroscopy and X-ray based techniques XPS and NEXAFS were used. The XPS and NEXAFS data were collected at the BESSY II beamline HE-SGM at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin during the low-alpha phase. The beamline system and the detector are described elsewhere [27]. Additionally, the system is equipped with a floodgun to prevent charge-induced effects on the sample surface. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) measurements were performed to measure the chemical surface properties. A Shimadzu Fourier transform spectrometer (IRPrestige-21, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with the DRS-8000 diffuse reflectance instrument was used in ambient air at ambient temperature [28,29]. Two different spectra were recorded: First, the full spectrum from 500 to 4000 cm−1 (resolution: 4 wave numbers, 100 repetitions) to evaluate the thickness-dependent influence on the chemical surface structure. Subsequently, a detailed measurement for the most relevant spectral range of 2800–3100 cm−1, the C-H-streching-region [30,31] was performed with a resolution of 1 wave number and 300 repetitions. Both measurements were repeated at least at three different positions on the sample surface to ensure surface homogeneity. The overall reference for the analysis of the a-C:H data and the measurements themselves is the raw polymer PVA or PVA/CMF, each treated with O2 plasma. The spectral analysis was performed with the commercial IR-Solution - FTIR Control Software (software version 1.30, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). First a multipoint baseline was inserted with the integrated manipulation tool, followed by a software integrated smoothing manipulation (changes only the appearance of the graph, but not the information). For the XPS measurements, a complete measurement spectrum (700 eV - 0 eV) was first recorded to get an overview of the entire chemical composition of the surface. In order to analyse the different bonding states of the carbon atoms, the C1s peak was examined at least at two different sample sites. These repeated measurements were performed to check the reproducibility and to evaluate the homogeneity and stability of the a-C:H layers. The C1s spectra were analysed with the commercially available software CasaXPS (software version 2.3.18, Casa Software Ltd., United Kingdom). The percentages of sp2, sp3, CO and CO bonds in the entire C1s peak were identified and evaluated. The results obtained were then applied to the corresponding layer thicknesses using Origin 8.1 software. In the NEXAFS series, both the C K- and O K-edges of the samples were recorded. The C-edge was also recorded at a minimum of two locations to assist in the accuracy of the measurements. The O-edges were used to detect the presence or absence of oxygen on the sample surface. All measurements have been performed in the “magic angle” at a photon incidence angle of 55° with the partial electron yield (PEY). In PEY, a counter voltage is applied and not all electrons emerging from the material can reach the measurement electronics. Therefore the measurement is more surface sensitive [27]. The spectra obtained from the C K-edges were analysed using the commercial Origin software. For this purpose, the spectra were first normalized and then adjusted to the decreasing ring current present at the BESSY experimental station during the low-alpha phase (100 mA decay mode). A correction for possible contamination of the grating by a previously measured gold edge was then performed. The individual steps were summarized in the paper by Watts et al. and described in detail elsewhere [32]. A further analysis was then performed using a self-written peak evaluation program and Origin 8.1 software."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Morphology,"3.1 Morphology The upper line in Fig. 1 of the AFM measurements show a relatively smooth, homogeneous surface for the untreated PVA. The most prominent structure visible for the PVA reference sample (Fig. 1a) are some roundish, particle-like structures protruding from the material surface. These particles may be pellets of the raw polymer that have not completely merged with the surrounding material during the production process. If the material is O2 plasma treated, a strong restructuring of the surface is visible (Fig. 1b). The formerly smooth surface is now covered with small craters, which is due to the roughening of the material by the plasma. These craters are also visible on the particles previously visible on the surface. With the deposition of a 50 nm a-C:H layer (Fig. 1c), a homogeneous surface coating is visible. This layer consists of a grain-like structure forming a closed film. The diameter of these grains is about 150 nm. The visibility of this grain-like structure indicates the completion of the interlayer phase [10,22,24], since normal layer growth is taking place afterwards, as explained by Smith [33]. The interlayer is a mixture phase between the material and the applied layer. After it is completed, the normal a-C:H film growth starts and grains begin to form [22]. Some single grains, which are one level higher and are a little larger, are visible. When the thickness of the layer increases to 100 nm (Fig. 1d), the surface appearance of the layer is similar to that of the 50 nm sample. The bottom line of Fig. 1 shows the AFM measurements for PVA/CMF samples. The surface of the reference sample (Fig. 1e) looks somehow a little more corrugated than for the pure PVA samples. This is most likely due to the reinforcement with CMF fibres in the polymer, whose outlines are visible on the material surface. In addition, the particle-like structures as visible in Fig. 1a are not present (roughness rrms PVA: 12.23 nm, PVA/CMF: 4.63 nm). With the O2 plasma treatment of the PVA/CMF (Fig. 1f), the surface is also more roughened here (rrms 6.98 nm). Compared to the pure PVA sample, no crater structure is visible over the entire surface. Rather, a more fibrous structure is revealed here, which is caused by the CMF fibres that have been incorporated into the material. If a 50 nm a-C:H layer is applied to the sample (Fig. 1g), a homogeneous layer is formed here as well, which consists of a closed grain-like structure. The grain structure does not look as round as the unreinforced PVA, but the size of the grain-like components is the same for both materials. Also, as already visible with PVA, PVA/CMF shows some larger grains, which seem to be located a level higher. When the layer thickness reaches 100 nm (Fig. 1h), the layer no longer consists of a closed, coarse grain-like layer, but appears much more homogeneous between the grains. A closer look shows that this homogeneous surface consists of a very fine, granular layer (rrms 8.99 nm). A comparison of the AFM images for PVA and the PVA/CMF shows that the surface structure of both materials is different and that the a-C:H layer grows with slight differences. The visible bigger grains for both materials at a film thickness of 50 nm is an indication for a completed interlayer between the basic material and the a-C:H layer. Similar behaviour have already been found on different materials [19,23,24]."
8,Surface wettability,"3.2 Surface wettability Fig. 2 shows the contact angles determined for PVA and PVA/CMF samples. As before, measurement series were performed for untreated reference samples, the O2 plasma treated ones and the coatings of 50 and 100 nm a-C:H. Three factors are significantly involved in the wettability of surfaces: The interaction of surface chemical bonds [34–37], the different carbon hybridization states on the surface [38–40] and thirdly the different surface topographies [41–43]. Hydrogenation of the surface enhances the hydrophobic character, since dangling bonds are saturated by hydrogen and strong CH bonds are formed. This leads to a weaker interaction between film and water [35–37]. If, on the other hand, the surface is oxygenated, the surface becomes more reactive with water, since oxygen-containing functional groups are formed on the surface [34]. A surface rich in sp2 hybridized carbon shows a higher contact angle than a surface rich in sp3 due to different surface free energies [38–40]. The surface free energy of an sp3 dominated surface shows only weak polarity of the dangling bonds compared to an sp2 hybridized surface due to its strongly covalent character [13,38]. Fig. 2A shows the measurements for the PVA samples. The raw PVA has a contact angle of 75° and is therefore more hydrophilic. If the PVA is treated with an oxygen plasma, the contact angle decreases to 32°, which is due to the strong oxygenation of the surface bonds. If a 50 nm thick a-C:H layer is applied to the PVA, the contact angle changes only imperceptibly to a slightly higher value. Additionally, the error bar increases, which is due to a rougher surface. With increasing the layer thickness to 100 nm, the contact angle again increases slightly, but the error of the measurement increases as well, indicating a rougher surface in line with the AFM topography. The obtained contact angles for the PVA/CMF samples are shown in Fig. 2B. The contact angle of the raw polymer is 59°, which is noticeably smaller than that for PVA itself. When the PVA/CMF is exposed to an oxygen plasma, the contact angle decreases to 32° and thus more or less the same value as the O2 treated pure PVA. Here too, oxygenation of the surface bonds is responsible for the decay. With a layer thickness of 50 nm, the contact angle further drops to only 25°, but here again at the expense of a larger error. The further decrease of the contact angle is completely different to the a-C:H coated PVA and indicates a different (chemical) structure of the carbon layer on the CMF reinforced PVA. With a layer thickness of 100 nm the contact angle increases strongly and reaches a value of 66°, which is probably due to a more sp3 hybridized surface. The finer graining of the surface visible in AFM, which makes the layer much more homogeneous, is also partly responsible for this change in the contact angle and the smaller error bar compared to the untreated PVA material. Again, the PVA/CMF behaves differently than the PVA. The layer, which was applied to the two different materials simultaneously in the same plasma, has a different character. Nevertheless, both systems show an overall hydrophilic behaviour. Especially the 50 nm a-C:H layers have a very small, but similar contact angle for both base materials, which is slightly increased with increasing layer thickness in the case of PVA and strongly increased for PVA/CMF."
9,Chemical composition,"3.3 Chemical composition The chemical analysis of the surface composition was performed by XPS, NEXAFS and DRIFT measurements. First, the results of the XPS measurements are presented and interpreted, which are shown in Fig. 3 . The data analysis was carried out as described in the experimental section. The peak positions have been confirmed by NIST database and the work of other groups [44–46]. Fig. 3A shows the measurements for the PVA. As a raw polymer, most of its carbons are sp2 hybridized and only a small part is sp3 bound. The high sp2 and low oxygen content is surprising. It is possible that more monomer chains of the original polymer are present at the surface, in which sp2 bound carbon is contained. The low oxygen content could be traceable to an overlap of oxygen by carbon. With oxygen plasma treatment the hybridization of the carbon hardly changes, the sp2 and sp3 contents decrease only slightly in favour of a growing CO content due to the oxidization of the polymer surface. This higher CO content can also be clearly seen in the contact angle measurements, where the contact angle with the O2 treatment drops sharply. If a 50 nm thick a-C:H layer is deposited on the material, the number of sp2 bonded carbons increases to more than 85%, while the sp3 bonded and CO bonds decrease considerably. Therefore, the applied a-C:H layer is dominated by sp2 bonded carbon. Comparing the results with the contact angle measurements, the contact angle also increases slightly. If the film thickness is increased to 100 nm, the proportion of sp2 hybridized carbon drops to 77% while the proportion of sp3 bonds increases slightly to 18%. With increasing plasma treatment duration of the surface and thus also increasing layer thickness, the proportion of sp3 bonds in the carbon network of the layer begins to increase, which is due to a comparatively longer bombardment with (high-energy) ions [16]. Nevertheless the network stays sp2 dominated and therefore more graphite-like [12]. The course of the PVA/CMF samples, which is shown in Fig. 3B, is different from the PVA. The raw polymer shows a high sp3 content of 66%, which explains the low contact angle of only 59° compared to the PVA. The proportion of sp2 bonds is about 26%. This proportion is possibly traceable to the CMF fibres. With O2 plasma treatment, both the proportion of sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbons decrease in favour of CO and CO bonding. The XPS measurement proves the oxygenation of the surface, which was already suspected by the decrease of the contact angle. By applying a 50 nm a-C:H layer, the sp2 bond becomes the dominant one on the surface. This has already been observed in the PVA samples, even though the coated PVA/CMF has only 58% of the sp2 bond. The comparatively higher proportion of sp3 bonds is probably due to the interlayer, which consists of a mixed phase of applied a-C:H layer and base material (which is strongly dominated by sp3). As the thickness of the layer increases to 100 nm, the proportion of sp2 bonds increases further and reaches 75%, while sp3 bonds drop to 8%. This increase is responsible for the rising value in contact angle measurements. It is noticeable that the proportions of sp2 bound carbon for 100 nm a-C:H correspond to PVA as well as to the reinforced PVA/CMF and are about 75% for both. Thus a graphite-like layer is present for both 100 nm a-C:H coated materials [12]. The XPS measurements show a clear difference in the chemical structures between raw PVA and PVA/CMF. The deposited layer shows different hybridization states for the respective basic polymer and composite and also in the further course of the coating they behave differently. The 50 nm layers applied to the two polymers differ strongly in their carbon bonds. Since the PVA/CMF raw material was more strongly sp3 bonded than the PVA, there is relatively more carbon sp3 bonded in the mixed phase of the layer and PVA/CMF, since the raw polymer is also incorporated in this phase. The fact that these sp3 bonds are still visible at 50 nm suggests that at least the PVA/CMF has a distinct interlayer of not much less than 50 nm, since the penetration depth of the XPS is only a few nm. The PVA, on the other hand, has a strongly sp2 dominated 50 nm a-C:H layer, since the raw material, which is brought into the interlayer here, is strongly sp2 dominated. Since the a-C:H layer remains dominated by sp2 in the further course of the coating process, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the thickness of the interlayer. By applying a 100 nm a-C:H layer the two layer systems are converging. While on the PVA a-C:H coating the sp2 fraction decreases in favour of the sp3 one, the sp2 hybridization increases with the application of a thicker layer on PVA/CMF. For both systems, the 100 nm layer thus have similar properties: a largely (75%) sp2 bonded and thus relatively soft layer, even if the systems differ greatly for the 50 nm a-C:H layers. The influence of the fibre reinforcement on the deposited a-C:H layer seems to decrease even with relatively thin layers. Fig. 4 displays the NEXAFS measurements; Fig. 4A for PVA and 4B for PVA/CMF. The peak positions have been determined to CC π (284.85 eV), CH (286.15 eV), CC (288.35 eV) and CC σ (292.55 eV) [47–51]. For the PVA samples (Fig. 4A), the reference shows only a small proportion of sp2 bonds (CC), contrary to the XPS measurements. For the O2 plasma treated PVA, the CC π peak and the peak associated with the CC bond weaken a little. If an a-C:H layer of 50 nm is deposited on the PVA, a dominant CC π peak is formed and the CC σ peak decreases slightly. The sp3 fraction also decreases slightly. With a further increase of the layer thickness this trend continues in favour of a stronger CC π bond. This is in contrast to the measurements with the XPS, where the sp3 bond increased slightly, but this may also be due to the different penetration depth. The results for the NEXAFS measurements of PVA/CMF samples are shown in Fig. 4B. The CH peak is well formed for the raw polymer, a CC π peak is hardly present. The CC σ peak is also weak but visible. The double bonds associated with sp2 hybridization are probably due to the CMF content. With O2 plasma treatment, the CC π peak is hardly noticeable, the CC σ is comparatively broadened and more emphasized by the surrounding bonds, while the CH peak is more pronounced. With the application of a 50 nm thick a-C:H layer, a strong CC π peak is formed, the CC σ peak decreases slightly, the proportion of the CH peak decreases strongly. This corresponds to the measurements obtained in XPS. If the layer thickness is increased to 100 nm, there are no changes in the NEXAFS measurements which is in contrast to the XPS measurements obtained, where the sp2 content increases and the sp3 content is strongly reduced. The differences obtained in the XPS and NEXAFS measurements are a result of the different penetration depth of the two measurement techniques. For additional surface evaluation of the chemical composition DRIFT measurements are recorded and discussed. For the subsequently a-C:H coated samples, the O2 plasma treated PVA (resp. PVA/CMF) was used as basic substrate and served as the reference spectra, since each a-C:H layer was deposited on such pre-treated material. DRIFT spectra are evaluated on the basics of infrared spectroscopy [31] and according to previous results of other groups and own observations [18,24,30,52,53]. Firstly, a full overview (450–4100 cm−1) for all samples was performed to check for main differences between the coated samples. For detailed analysis measurements in the interesting region, the CH stretching area at 2800–3050 cm−1 was performed [31]. In this area peaks for =CH2 and –CH3 are located [30,31,52,53]. It is noticeable that the DRIFT measurements do not correspond to the X-ray spectroscopic methods. Only the sp3 oscillations could be detected in the measurements, the sp2 oscillations could not be detected. This problem has already occurred for other a-C:H coated polymers [10]. For the coated PVA and PVA/CMF samples, only the two oscillations of the sp3CH2 as (asymmetric) at 2939 cm−1 [52,53] and the sp3CH bond at 2903 cm−1 [52] could be detected. The presence of =CH2 oscillations indicates that an interlayer present between the material and the a-C:H layer is completed [24]. Based on the DRIFT measurements compared to earlier results [24], it can therefore be concluded to take less than 50 nm. In Fig. 5A the results for the PVA measurements are shown. As the thickness of the layer increases from 50 nm to 100 nm, there is a shift in sp3CH2 as vibration to a wavenumber of 2936 cm−1. This shift to lower wavenumbers indicates a smaller carbon‑hydrogen binding energy and therefore a larger carbon‑hydrogen bond distance for the =CH2 group [31]. This behaviour has already been demonstrated for such a-C:H coatings on several (bio-)polymers [11,18,20,21,24]. Furthermore, both sp3 binding peaks were more pronounced. This is in line with the results from the XPS measurements. The results of the PVA/CMF measurements are shown in Fig. 5B. Here again, the same shift back of the sp3CH2 as oscillation occurs, which could already be determined for the PVA. The only noticeable difference to the a-C:H coated PVA is in the shape of the two sp3 peaks at 100 nm film thickness. In the step from 50 nm to 100 nm the sp3CH2 as peak seems to weaken, while the sp3CH peak is much more pronounced compared to the results for the coated PVA. The XPS measurements show for the first 50 nm a-C:H layer thickness a layer dominated by sp2 bonds for both materials. However, differences are visible. The PVA/CMF has a higher proportion of sp3 bonds due to the fibre reinforcement and the resulting different composition of the interlayer. At a layer thickness of 100 nm the layers are similar. The NEXAFS measurements confirm the 50 nm XPS measurements, but there are differences between the two techniques for the 100 nm a-C:H layers. The DRIFT measurements do not show any sp2 oscillations, but due to the CH2 oscillations present there, it can be concluded that the interlayer phase is completed within the first 50 nm layer thickness."
10,Conclusion,"Pure polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and PVA reinforced with cellulose microfibers (PVA/CMF) were coated with a-C:H layers in order to compare how a modification of the base material affects the growth of the a-C:H layer. For the coating an RF PE-CVD plasma with acetylene precursor was used. Layer examination was done by AFM and contact angle for surface properties and by XPS, NEXAFS and DRIFT measurements for chemical composition. Layers up to 100 nm a-C:H were realized adhering stably to the material. The AFM measurements show a similar growth pattern of the layers on both materials, but the resulting grain-like structure of the 100 nm layer is finer for the PVA/CMF. This is also noticeable in the different contact angles (35° for pure PVA, 67° for PVA/CMF). The presence of pronounced grains in AFM measurements of the 50 nm a-C:H layer thickness for both materials indicates a previous completion of the interlayer. This is also confirmed by the DRIFT measurements, since =CH2 bonds are already present at 50 nm, which only form when the interlayer is completed. The XPS measurements show large differences in the hybridization of carbon for the reference samples of the PVA as well as the enhanced PVA samples. The influence of the CMF fibres is clearly visible for the raw polymer as well as the O2 treated samples. Both materials are similar in respect to the fact that the applied layer is sp2 dominated at 50 nm layer thickness, even if its proportion is significantly lower for the enhanced PVA. The higher proportion of sp3 bonds here is probably due to base material present in the interlayer phase. At 100 nm, the sp2 fraction for the enhanced PVA increases, while it decreases in the normal PVA in favour of a stronger sp3 fraction. It is noticeable that at 100 nm a-C:H layer thickness about 75% sp2 bound carbon is present for both materials. The NEXAFS measurements do not show any major differences for the respective 50 and 100 nm coatings of the different base materials. Due to the shift of the measured peak positions, the DRIFT measurements prove a film thickness dependent change of the chemical structure with increasing film thickness. Overall, the reinforcement of PVA with CMF fibres does not lead to too much variation for the resulting coatings. The measurements for the 50 nm samples differ chemically, which is due to the different interlayer development. At 100 nm layer thickness the systems approach each other, the influence of the fibres is, at least chemically, only limited to the initial growth. The surface roughness of the AFM images differs between the two systems, but this is due to the relatively thin layer of 100 nm, which cannot yet compensate surface conditions. Additionally, the contact angle differs due to different surface roughness for the pure and reinforced PVA. Further measurements of thinner coatings would provide information about the different initial growth of the layer. Thicker layers must also be analysed to check whether and how the modification of the base material affects the applied layers and their stability."
