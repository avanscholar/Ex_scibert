0,Introduction,"Lignin, as one of the three major components of lignocellulosic biomass, is recognized as the most abundant renewable aromatic resource in nature [1–3], which is composed of three building blocks, i.e., sinapyl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and p-coumaryl alcohol, connected by various C-C/O bonds [4–6]. To date, a large amount of lignin from paper industry and cellulose-based biorefineries is only used as a low-grade fuel for heat/steam generation [7–9]. In fact, lignin has great potential as platform compounds and precursors for high-quality fuels owing to its aromatic structure. Cracking the C-C/O bonds between the building blocks to yield phenolic monomers is a promising way for lignin utilization, and many attempts have been made [7,10–12]. Among various methods for cleavage of C-C/O bonds, catalytic hydrogenolysis (i.e., cleavage of a bond induced by hydrogen) is the most popular one because of the high selectivity and quality to target products [13–16]. Heterogeneous catalysts based on transition metals (such as Ru, Ni, Mo, and so on)[17–19], initial hydrogen pressure (30–400 bar), and high temperature (170–400 °C) [20–22] are generally required for such lignin hydrogenolysis. In this case, considerable work has been carried out to optimize the yield of phenolic monomers from lignin by controlling the metal and/or support species to improve the activity and selectivity of catalysts [23–25], among which the so-called metal-support interactions play very important roles [26]. Doping and surface modification of the support are the two promising methods to adjust the metal-support interactions. For instance, hydrogenolysis of birch organosolv lignin at 300 ℃ and 1 MPa H2 was operated over N-doped Ru@C to obtain 30.50 wt% of monomers, which was nearly twice the yield of undoped Ru@C [27]. This strategy is dependent on the principle that nitrogen as an electron donor atom can reduce the work function of carbon support after doping and thus enhance interactions between support and metal, contributing to dispersion of active sites [28]. Based on the lignin structure, the difficulties in high-efficient hydrogenolysis of lignin mainly come from the recalcitrance of various C(sp2)-O/C bonds with high bond dissociation energy (BDE). It is reported that the BDEs of C(sp2)-O-C(sp2) (i.e., 4-O-5) and C(sp2)-C(sp2) (i.e., 5–5) linkages in lignin can be as high as 314 and 483 kJ/mol, respectively [29,30]. The cleavage of such strong linkages usually requires high temperature and pressure, leading to hydrogenation (i.e., reduction or saturation of a compound by hydrogen without cleaving bond) [23,31], which has been considered to waste the expensive hydrogen and reduce the selectivity to phenolic monomers [32]. Hence, more attention should be paid to the relationship between hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation. As a typical example, hydrogenolyses of diaryl ethers catalyzed by a soluble nickel carbene complex were successfully performed under just 1 bar of hydrogen at temperatures of 80 to 120 °C, which produced exclusively arenes and phenols. In comparison to the prevalent heterogeneous catalyst, however, such homogeneous catalyst is limited by catalyst recovery [33]. It is a remarkable fact that C(sp3)-O/C bonds are much easier to cleave than C(sp2)-O/C bonds. Inspired by this, hydrogenation of C(sp2)-O/C bonds to C(sp3)-O/C bonds in lignin is thus expected to facilitate the lignin hydrogenolysis toward phenolic monomers. Certainly, the degree of hydrogenation should be carefully controlled to avoid the saturation of phenolic products. Graphitized carbon nanotubes, featured by facile modification of their surface properties, good hydrothermal stability, and moderate interactions with active metals, are widely applied as an excellent catalyst support [34]. In this study, Ru supported on various functionalized carbon nanotubes were prepared to adjust their hydrogenation ability through different interactions between support and metal. The obtained catalysts were then employed for the hydrogenolysis of a lignin model compound and herbaceous lignin, which is derived from corncob containing abundant C(sp2)-O/C bonds in the lignin units (e.g., p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid). The effect of hydrogenation performance of those catalysts on the corncob lignin hydrogenolysis to phenolic monomers was discussed in detail."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Corncob lignin was purchased from Shandong Longlive Bio-technology Co., Ltd, China, whose particle size was ranged from 40 to 200 mesh. Lignin β-O-4 model compound, phenethyl phenyl ether (PPE), was purchased from Energy Chemical, China. Graphitized carbon nanotubes (CNT) and aminated, hydroxylated and carboxylated carbon nanotubes (denoted as CNT-NH2, CNT-OH, CNT-COOH; outer diameter, 8–15 nm; length, ~50 μm; purity, >95%; content of the group, 0.45 wt%, 1.85 wt%, 1.28 wt%, respectively) were purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd., China (Nos. XFM37, 38, 39, and 62). Ruthenium chloride hydrate (RuCl3·xH2O) with Ru content 35–42% was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation, China. Methanol (>99.5%) was purchased from Nanjing Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China."
3,Preparation of Ru-CNT catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of Ru-CNT catalysts The Ru-CNT catalysts were prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation method. Briefly, every 1 g of CNTs (dried) was mixed with 0.1349 g RuCl3·xH2O (containing about 39 wt% Ru) impregnated with a certain amount of water, to obtain the Ru mass loading of 5% supported on CNTs. Then the samples were dried in vacuum for 24 h at 70 ℃. After being ground, the above were reduced with the flow of 5% H2 and 95% Ar (total 1 L/min), at 400 ℃ for 3 h."
4,Catalyst performance tests,"2.3 Catalyst performance tests 1 g dried lignin (80 ℃, for 24 h) and 0.2 g catalysts with 30 mL methanol as solvent were put into a mechanical stirring autoclave. After the autoclave was sealed, the residual air in it was purged by nitrogen for five times, then the nitrogen was purged by hydrogen, and finally the autoclave was pressurized to 1 MPa hydrogen. The hydrogenolysis reaction was held at 250 ℃ for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, or 6 h. After the reaction, the reactor was put into ice water and cooled to room temperature. The products were filtered, and the filtrate was collected and then divided into two equal parts. One part was concentrated to constant weight by rotary evaporator to calculate the yield of lignin oil, and the other one was transfer into a 10 mL volumetric flask for qualitative and quantitative analyses. For the reaction of lignin model compound, 0.3 g PPE and 0.15 g catalysts with 20 mL methanol as solvent were put into the autoclave. The remaining steps are the same as above. Every catalyst test was repeated three times and the average values of them are shown."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The resulting organic-soluble oil was subjected to Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS) analysis using an Agilent 7890A series GC system equipped with a J&W VF-1701 ms chromatographic column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). From the initial temperature 40 ℃, the column oven was heated to 200 ℃ with the 5 ℃/min heating rate and then heated to 280 ℃ by a 10 °C/min ramp, which was held for 3 min. The external standard was selected as the quantitative method of lignin monomers, and the authentic standards were obtained from commercial sources. The phenolic monomer yield was calculated according to Formula 1: (1) Y monomer = C monomer × V 1000 × m lignin where Ymonomer (%) is the yield of monomer based on the weight of commercial corncob lignin; Cmonomer (g/L) is the concentration of detected monomer based on its peak area calculated according to the linear formula of the authentic standard curves; V (mL) is the total volume of lignin depolymerized sample, 1 mL of which was drawn for GC/MS analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out using JEM-1400 microscope (Japan). After being dried and ground, the TEM samples were treated by ultrasonic in the mixture of water and ethanol. A small amount was taken and dried under a heat lamp, and then put into the electron microscope. The average particle diameter was calculated according to Gaussian fitting. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted in AXIS UltraDLD (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with Al Kα radiation (150 W). Before the measurement, the prepared catalysts were mixed with pure silica as an internal standard. The wide pass energy is 160 eV and the narrow pass energy is 40 eV. To avoid the oxidation of metallic Ru under ambient conditions, the prepared catalysts were reduced and reacted in an elevated-pressure cell that was combined with the XPS system. The binding energies were calibrated with Si 2p. The structures of molecule R-X and the free radicals R and X were optimized at the M06-2X/6-311G(d,p) level of theory by the Gaussian 16 program package [35]. No imaginary frequency was found after performing frequency calculations. BDE was then calculated by Formula 2: (2) E B R - X = E R + E ZP R + E X + E ZP X - E R X - E ZP R X where E B is BDE; E is molecular energy; E ZP is zero-point energy."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization TEM was used to observe the morphology and structure of the prepared catalysts, and the distribution of Ru nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes could be clearly reflected. The particle size of Ru nanoparticles was measured by selecting 200 particles and transferring their size data into frequency histogram. The average nanoparticle size and standard deviation are obtained by Gaussian fitting. It could be seen from Fig. 1 that carbon nanotubes are crossed or side by side and Ru particles may be outside or into the tube wall, anchored in an orderly or disorderly manner. The average sizes of Ru carried on CNT, CNT-COOH, CNT-NH2, and CNT-OH are 2.73, 3.00, 1.86, and 2.61 nm, respectively. Considering that the catalysts were prepared in the same batch by the same method, it is believed that the difference in Ru particle sizes should be from the interactions between Ru and carbon nanotubes [26]. Compared with other functional groups, amino group on carbon nanotubes favored the formation of finest Ru particles. The valence of the metal in a supported catalyst significantly influences its catalytic activity [36,37]. In this work, carbon nanotubes functionalized by different groups were employed as supports, which potentially affected the chemical states of Ru nanoparticles. XPS analysis was thus conducted to characterize the catalysts to determine the chemical states of Ru, and the peak of Ru 3p 3/2 was split into Ru0 and Run+, as depicted in Fig. 2 . The proportions of these two chemical states of the metal Ru were also calculated based on their peak area. Compared with Ru@CNT, slightly higher proportions of Ru0 were found for Ru@CNT-COOH, Ru@CNT-NH2, and Ru@CNT-OH, among which Ru@CNT-NH2 possessed the highest one (82.21%), indicating easier reduction of Ru species over those functionalized supports. In addition, the binding energy of Ru0 from different catalysts were obviously shifted because of the interactions between Ru nanoparticles and supports. The binding energy of Ru0 on Ru@CNT was at 461.8 eV [38,39], while those on Ru@CNT-OH, Ru@CNT-COOH, and Ru@CNT-NH2 exhibited shifts of −0.2 eV, +0.3 eV, and +0.7 eV, respectively, indicating electron transfer between Ru and the functionalized CNT. The largest shift of binding energy in Ru@CNT-NH2 demonstrated the strongest interactions between Ru and CNT-NH2, which probably also leads to the finest particle size of Ru."
8,Phenolic monomers from lignin depolymerization over different catalysts,"3.2 Phenolic monomers from lignin depolymerization over different catalysts As important platform compounds and promising precursors for high-quality fuels, phenolic monomers in lignin oil are usually the target products from lignin conversion [40,41]. According to preliminary experiments on the effect of reaction time, 2 h was the optimized time to produce the most phenolic monomers and thus mainly employed for the following runs. The lignin oil yields from the runs over different catalysts are listed in entry 17 of Table 1 . It is clearly exhibited that the lignin hydrogenolysis without any catalyst produced the least oil, of which the yield was as low as 65.50%. Catalysts using significantly improved the yield of the lignin oil, and the highest one up to 86.35% came from Ru@CNT. It should be noted that the highest lignin oil yield does not necessarily mean the highest phenolic monomers, because phenolic dimers and/or oligomers are generally present in lignin oil. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of phenolic monomers by GC/MS was thus performed. From the total ion chromatograms (TICs, Fig. 3 ) of the products and their yields (Table 1) detected by GC/MS, obvious differences in product distribution among the runs with and without catalysts can be found. The most abundant compounds in the blank run were 14 (methyl ferulate) and 15 (methyl coumarate), while those in the catalytic runs were 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11. To further understand the reaction mechanism during the lignin depolymerization, the changes in the yields of 4, 5, 10, 11, 14, and 15 with the reaction time were studied. As exhibited in Fig. 4 , the yields of 14 and 15 reached the maximum (1.61 and 1.85 wt%, respectively) at 0.25 h and then gradually reduced to 0.55 and 0.84 wt% at 2–6 h, respectively. The yields of 4, 5, 10, and 11, however, continuously increased before 2 h and then stabilized at 2–6 h. These results indicate that the linkages between the precursors of 14 and 15 (p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid moieties [42]) and other units are mainly weak C-O bonds (as demonstrated in Fig. 5 ), which can be easily broken without catalyst. However, the yield of total phenolic monomers was as low as 10.25 wt%, probably due to the repolymerization of the resulting monomeric intermediates A and B (see Fig. 5) to oligomers/polymers. With the introduction of various Ru based catalysts, hydrogenation of compounds 14 and 15 took place to produce compounds 11 and 10, of which the yields significantly increased to 5.65–8.93 and 3.47–6.75 wt%, respectively. Furthermore, the formation of compounds 4 and 5, which were the respective decarboxylation products from compounds 10 and 11, was also markedly improved. This is reasonable because the BDE of Cβ-Cγ in compounds 14 and 15 were respectively higher than those in compounds 11 and 10, as shown in Fig. 5. Based on Le chatelier's principle, the sequential hydrogenation and decarboxylation reactions of compounds 14 and 15 not only facilitated the cleavage of the C-O bonds between the acid moieties and other units in lignin structure, but also reduced the repolymerization of intermediates A and B to oligomers/polymers. As a result, the yields of total phenolic monomers hugely increased to 22.50 wt% for Ru@CNT, 19.71 wt% for Ru@CNT-OH, 27.12 wt% for Ru@CNT-NH2, and 22.43 wt% for Ru@CNT-COOH. Again, Ru@CNT-NH2 exhibited the best catalytic performance, which was mainly due to the strongest interactions between Ru and CNT-NH2, as discussed in Section 3.1. It is worth noting that the acidity or basicity of the prepared catalysts might also affect the production of phenolic monomers, which will be investigated in future studies."
9,Effect of partial hydrogenation on lignin depolymerization to phenolic monomers,"3.3 Effect of partial hydrogenation on lignin depolymerization to phenolic monomers Compared with hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation is generally considered to be an undesirable reaction in lignin depolymerization to phenolic monomers, because it consumes hydrogen and saturates aromatic rings. However, the results shown in Section 3.2 suggest that the improvement of phenolic monomer production was mainly due to the partial hydrogenation of intermediate products. To confirm the effect of partial hydrogenation on lignin hydrogenolysis, the hydrotreatment of lignin β-O-4 model compound, PPE, was conducted with the above catalysts. The products and their yield identified by GC/MS are shown in Fig. 6 . Totally, 12 compounds were detected, which can be mainly classified into three groups, i.e., hydrogenolysis products (compounds 5′ and 7′), full hydrogenation products (compounds 1′, 2′, 3′, 6′, and 8′) and partial hydrogenation products (4′, 9′, 10′, 11′, and 12′). In all runs with the Ru-based catalysts, (2-cyclohexylethoxy)cyclohexane (compound 8′) was the richest composition, indicating a good hydrogenation performance for all the catalysts employed here. It is very interesting to find that the total yield of partial hydrogenation products follows an order of Ru@CNT-NH2 (42.10%) > Ru@CNT (9.57%) > Ru@CNT-COOH (1.01%) > Ru@CNT-OH (0.62%) (Table 2 ), which is in good agreement with the order of phenolic monomer yield in Table 1. The reason why the partial hydrogenation of PPE occurs should come from the different reactivities of the two aromatic rings. In terms of the structures and yields of the partial hydrogenation products (9′–12′) in Fig. 6, it can be found that the aromatic ring close to the O atom in PPE is harder to be hydrogenated than the other one because of the stable p-π conjugated system between the O and aromatic ring. In the case of Ru@CNT-NH2, the richest compound in partial hydrogenation products was 11′, suggesting a low reactivity of Ru@CNT-NH2 to the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring conjugated with the O atom. The reaction pathways of catalytic PPE hydrotreatment are exhibited in Fig. 7 and are divided into two routes. Route 1 demonstrates the direct hydrogenolysis of PPE. Since the BDE of Caryl-O is higher than that of Cβ-O in PPE, breakage of Cβ-O was the predominate hydrogenolysis pathway, resulting in the production of compounds 1′, 3′, and 5′ with further hydrogenation. Besides, full hydrogenation and random partial hydrogenation of benzene rings of PPE were led by Route 2 firstly, contributing to a conversion of C(sp2)-O in PPE to C(sp3)-O [19], thus decreasing its BDE (Fig. 7). Compound 8′ could be depolymerized by two ways for the comparable BDEs of Cβ-O and C(sp3)-O to form the fully hydrogenated products of 1′, 2′, 3′, and 6′. Although compound 9′ was almost about to be fully hydrogenated, the remaining C(sp2)-O gave way to the cleavage of Cβ-O, followed by the isomerization of the resulting product to form 4′. On the other hand, the hydrogenolysis products, phenol (5′) and phenylethyl alcohol (7′), could be generated from the partial hydrogenation products 10′–12′. As shown in Fig. 6, Ru@CNT-NH2 supplies the highest yield of those partial hydrogenation products, leading to the most abundant hydrogenolysis products (2.87%, Table 2) among the investigated catalysts. The positive effect of the partial hydrogenation of a catalyst on lignin hydrogenolysis to phenolic monomers was thus demonstrated."
10,Conclusions,"Ru@CNT, Ru@CNT-OH, Ru@CNT-COOH, and Ru@CNT-NH2 with different hydrogenation performances were prepared for hydrogenolysis of lignin to phenolic monomers. According to the XPS analysis, the largest positive shift (0.7 eV) in binding energy of Ru 3p3/2 for Ru@CNT-NH2 was observed compared to Ru@CNT, indicating the strongest interactions between the CNT-NH2 and Ru. Such interactions enable formation of the finest Ru nanoparticles (1.86 nm) and mild hydrogenation performance. The highest phenolic monomers yield of 27.12% from corncob lignin hydrogenolysis over Ru@CNT-NH2 is thus attributed to the partial hydrogenation of C(sp2)-O/C bonds to C(sp3)-O/C bonds, as further proved by the PPE study."
