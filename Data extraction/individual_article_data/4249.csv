0,Introduction,"The world in the 21st century facing challenges in two sectors;-, one is energy harvesting and storage and the other is environmental remediation. Both the sectors are related to sustainability in the supply of energy as well as cleanliness, aiming at the reduction of global warming [1]. Though fossil fuels are a gifted source of energy, their unmanageable use has led to major issues, both in the energy and environmental arena. Hence, proper concern in finding alternatives to fossil fuels is gaining much attention across the universe, with the hope that the world will be free from energy crises and issues related to the environment [2–4]. The researchers, scientists and technologists are in the work of developing materials that possess twin features to resolve both energy and environmental matters. Hydrogen generation through water splitting stands first as one of the alternative energy harvesting and storage systems due to its eco-friendly nature and high availability of resources [5,6]. Pollution in water is one of the universal issues that damaged the life of aquatic lives and the surrounding environment. Among the various pollutants present in water, synthetic dyes are the one which is hazardous, toxic, carcinogenic, and also leads to high chemical oxygen demand [7–9]. The cosmetic, leather, tanning, paper, textile and food Industries use more amounts of dyes. These dyes are obtained by petroleum intermediates and coal tar and finally liquidated into main water bodies without any treatment. Once, these colored species accumulate in water bodies affects the photosynthetic phenomena by hampering the sunlight [10–12]. For many years, metals like Au, Pt, Pd and Ru are used as catalysts for the generation of hydrogen, irrespective of their high cost and toxicity [13,14]. Hence, there is a need for eco-friendly materials, easy methods of synthesis, and cost-effectiveness. There are several methods available to treat the pollutants present in water, which include, chlorination, ultrafiltration, ozonation, adsorption, electrolysis, etc [15–19]. Some of these methods involve the conversion of organic matters into intermediate products as secondary pollutants. To this end, catalytic degradation of the organic dyes in ambient temperature using renewable sources of energy i.e. solar energy is a most promising alternative [20,21]. Semiconductor photocatalysts are considered as a choice of materials to address environmental remediation and energy harvesting. TiO2, ZnS, CdS, RuO2, ZrO2, IrO2, Nb2O5, V2O5, etc, are the semiconductors used as photocatalysts for the evolution of hydrogen and organic material degradation [22–25]. Fujishima and Honda used TiO2 based electrodes for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution [26]. Thereafter, TiO2 is the most widely used material in photocatalysis and reports reveal, it is stable, low cost, and low toxic material for light-assisted phenomena. However, TiO2 owns its limitations, such as swift charge carrier recombination, O2 evolution through backward reaction, and insufficient absorption of light due to the wide bandgap. Two metals Niobium and Tantalum are considered twin brothers, as they appear in group V of the periodic table and are expected to exhibit similar physical and chemical properties. Oxides of Nb and Ta proved to exhibit good light absorption capacity, as a result, found to be used for organic transformations and heterogeneous catalysis [27,28]. Along with this, Ta2O5 exhibits a high refractive index, high dielectric constant and hence used in textiles, photovoltaics, X-ray coatings, CT scans, plastic nanowires, and other applications [29,30]. Ta2O5 has been considered as a catalyst for the light-driven water splitting process, as it possesses a higher reduction potential than conventional TiO2 as well as a reduction potential of water [31–34]. Though Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 have been used in hydrogen evolution through water splitting and pollutant detoxification, their practical application is still not well-established. The reason could be a limited range of absorption of light, high resistance, photo corrosion, indirect bandgap and ineffective charge separation reduces its photocatalytic activity. To enhance its catalytic activity, some noble metal atoms were decorated on its surface like Pt, Au, Ag, etc [35–37] Again, using noble metals is not suitable, since they are toxic and high cost. Hence, TO is required to blend with the other materials such as semiconductors, carbon materials, layered materials, etc that could reduce the bandgap, enhances the conductivity, efficient charge transfer, high surface area, and thereby enhances the photocatalytic performance [38–41]. Graphene, as such or in its other forms like GO and RGO attracted researchers in almost all the fields of science because of its mechanical strength, quantum hall effect at room temperature, easy mobility of electrons, large surface area, thermal conductivity, good charge separation, and tuneable bandgap [42,43]. However, RGO requires slight modulation with more intrinsic properties to meet its practical applications in all fields. To tailor out the properties of GO/RGO, a feasible approach is chemical doping of the heteroatoms like boron (B)/nitrogen (N). Among these, doping of N is most common, as it helps in attaining the semiconductor property by RGO by opening up its bandgap. Additionally, N doping to graphene network interestingly creates charge distributions and asymmetric spin, which significantly enhances the catalytic performance of the RGO in presence of light. There are several articles in the literature where nitrogen-doped graphene materials alone are used as catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and dye degradation [44,45]. Liu and co-workers synthesized mesoporous Ta2O5 nanorods using the sol–gel method and used hydrogen evolution reaction through the splitting of water [46]. A heterojunction of Ta2O5 with g-C3N4 has been fabricated for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and reported 33.9 mmol h−1g−1 [47]. Ta2O5 nanoparticle has been generated by an ultrasound-assisted method with a bandgap 3.12 eV and used as a photocatalyst for the degradation of methylene blue [48]. Carbon microtube (CMT) decorated with Ta2O5 in ethanol alkaline medium and reported enhanced photocatalytic activity towards degradation of xylenol orange and methylene blue [49]. Sun et al. reported that G/Ta2O5 degradation of MB (50%) even after 120 min [50]. Nitrogen has been doped to Ta2O5 nanoflowers and used as a photocatalyst for the degradation of MB [51]. Sulfur doped Ta2O5 mesoporous nanocomposite has been used for the degradation of MB [52]. Recently, Ta2O5 nanoparticles with O2 deficiency have been synthesized by using a solvothermal method and annealed in Ar atmosphere evolved 10.67 μmol g−1 h−1 of H2 [53].To the best of our knowledge Ta2O5 has not been used in combination with nitrogen-doped RGO for its photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution and simultaneous degradation of dyes. In the present work, the authors synthesized orthorhombic Ta2O5 by simple precipitation technique; further decorated on Nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide using simple hydrothermal method. The characterization supported the doping of N to RGO matrix and recombination with Ta2O5. The photocatalytic performance of TO, NRGO, and TO@NRGO were evaluated for photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen and degradation of methylene blue and rhodamine blue. Further, the work has been extended in evaluating simultaneous degradation of MB and RhB dyes under optimum conditions. The synthesized TO@NRGO nanocomposite will serve as a multipurpose material for resolving energy crisis and environmental issues in the coming years."

4,Synthesis of δTO and NRGO,"2.3 Synthesis of δTO and NRGO 20 mL of 0.2 mol L−1 NaOH solution was slowly added into a 20 mL of 0.1 mol L−1 tantalum chloride (TaCl5) solution and the resultant was magnetically stirred for 30 min. The final precipitate was centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 min and then washed twice with acetone and once with ethyl alcohol to remove organic impurities. The obtained precipitate was calcined at 400 °C for four hours. The obtained powder was hand-ground and stored in an airtight container for further use and labeled as TO (δTa2O5). Graphene oxide was synthesized by using the modified Hummers’ method [54]. Nitrogen-doped RGO was prepared by taking 0.1 wt% of GO dispersed in 50 mL of water and subjected to ultrasonication for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, urea was added to the GO dispersed solution with a mass ratio of 50:1 (urea/GO). The urea/GO mixture was sonicated for 30 min. After addition of hydrazine to GO with a mass ratio of 7:10 (hydrazine/GO and stirred for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, the obtained solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept in an oven at 120 °C for 4 h. After the reaction, the obtained products were washed with diluted water sufficiently to remove residual urea and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight."
5,Synthesis of TO@NRGO,"2.4 Synthesis of TO@NRGO A ratio of 2:1 NRGO and δ-TO particles were taken in 50 mL of distilled water and placed in an ultrasonicator for 15 min for the uniform distribution. Then the above mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept in an oven at 160 °C for 4 h. After the reaction, the obtained products were washed with diluted water sufficiently to remove residual urea and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight."
6,Hydrogen evolution experiment,"2.5 Hydrogen evolution experiment 10 mg of TO, NRGO and TO@NRGO were ultrasonicated and dispersed in 50 mL of water in a quartz vessel. 15 mL of tetraethanolamine (sacrificial agent) was added and purged in the mixture with N2. Illumination of the light was carried using a 400 W Xenon lamp upon continuous magnetic stirring. The evolved gas was collected and measured using a thermal conductivity detector outfitted with a gas chromatograph (Perkin Elmer ARNL 580C)."
7,Dye degradation,"2.6 Dye degradation The degradation experiments were carried out in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India by utilizing solar radiation during summer from 11.30 am to 4.00 pm. The MB and RhB solution was taken on RB flask and sonicated and added different photocatalysts. The mixture was continuously stirred to attain adsorption/desorption equilibrium. 3 mL aliquots were withdrawn during photocatalysis and centrifuged at fixed rpm. Later, separated the supernatant and collected also measured the absorption of MB and RhB using UV–visible spectrophotometer at 664 and 554 nm, respectively. The percentage of degradation of dye was calculated using Eq. (1); (1) % d e g r a d a t i o n = C i - C f C i × 100 where Ci and Cf are initial and final concentrations of the dye respectively."
8,Results and discussions,"The Bruker D2 Phaser XRD was used to record the X-ray diffraction patterns of NRGO, TO, TO@NRGO nanocomposite, and is depicted in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1a clearly shows that a single broad peak at 2θ = 25.3° corresponding to the presence of NRGO and absence of characteristic peak 10° indicating the successful reduction of GO to RGO. The XRD and UV–Visible spectra of RGO is confirming the reduction of GO to RGO and details are given in supplementary file (Fig. S1). Fig. 1b shows the XRD pattern of showing the diffraction peaks at 22.7°, (0 0 1) 28.39°, (1 0 0) 36.77°, (1 0 1) 46.86°, (0 0 2) 50.46°, (1 1 0) 55.75°, (1 0 2) 59.0°, (2 0 0) 64.15°, (2 0 1) and 78.0° (2 0 2) corresponds to the hexagonal δ-TO (JCPDS no. 19-1299) which is a relatively stable material. The most common and stable form of TO is orthorhombic but the absence of a peak around 44.8, which corresponds to the (3 4 0) plane confirms the δ hexagonal phase [55]. δ-TO has a hexagonal structure (space group P6/mmm) made of layers connected by oxygen bridges above and below the tantalum atoms. Fig. 1c shows the XRD diffraction pattern of NRGO anchored with δ-TO in which all the peaks corresponding to δ-TO were retained at the same time diffraction peaks of NRGO are not identified in the diffraction pattern due to overlapping of the peaks. Raman spectrum of TO, NRGO and TO@NRGO are given in Fig. 2 For TO the peak below 150 cm−1 is assigned to its lattice mode, the bending modes are also assigned as δ(Ta-O-Ta) and δ(O-3Ta) for peaks between 150 and 400 cm−1. In the region between 400 cm−1 and 1000 cm−1 assigned to vibrations in the TaO6 octahedra and presence of TaO5. The NRGO characteristic peaks 1350 and 1598 cm−1 are attributed to the D and G bands, respectively [56]. The D and G bands appearance is due to the vibration mode of Sp2 carbon atoms and breathing modes of six atom rings. In the case of TO@NRGO, the characteristic peaks of TO are weakened almost and observed high intensity in D and G bands of NRGO due to backward fluorescence of NRGO. Morphological studies of the synthesized materials have been studied using TEM and images are given in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3a represents the integrated layers of NRGO with a size of several microns were observed. It also shows the intense dark spots of the nitrogen group doped above and below the layered planes of RGO. TEM images given in Fig. 3b show that δ-TO particles prepared were at nano size and mostly spherical primary particles necking and forming chainlike aggregate structures. The grains of the crystals were different contrast were observed in the Fig. 3C is due to the more number of nucleation of the δ-TO centers and oriented in random directions concerning one another, during the formation of planar defects on the surface. The calculated d spacing of the Moire fringes was 3.06 nm at different planes of the crystals is indicated (Fig. 3d). To understand the interaction between elements and their bonding states of TO@NRGO nanocomposite X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been carried and the results are given in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4a consists of 3 deconvoluted peaks at 284.3, 285.32 and 287.8 eV corresponds to CC/CC, CN and CO, of C1s respectively. The N 1s XPS spectrum is given in Fig. 4b and also exhibits three characteristic deconvoluted peaks pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic N centred at 398.5, 399.6 and 400.84 eV, respectively. O 1s consists of 2 deconvoluted peaks (Fig. 4c) due to OTa and hydroxyl groups at 530.8 and 532.5 eV, respectively. Ta 4f XPS spectrum (Fig. 4d) consists of 2 peaks originated at 26.6 and 28.5 eV assigned to Ta 4f7/2 and 4f3/2, respectively. This indicates the incorporation of TO in the NRGO matrix. Nitrogen Adsorption/Desorption Isotherms (Fig. 5 ) are generally used to determine textural properties such as pore size distribution, pore volume and specific surface area. The determination of BET is important because the applications for the formed nanocomposites are greatly affected by their surface areas. It is observed that the specific surface area of the TO@NRGO is 312 m2 g−1 which is larger than that of NRGO (149 m2 g−1), with subsequent enhancement of the capacitance. The higher surface area of TO@NRGO nanocomposites compared to their NRGO counterparts is attributed to the better assembly of TO nanoparticles on the nitrogen-doped surface of NRGO and better distribution in the solution during the nanocomposite preparation. To further examine the optical properties of the catalysts, the DRS spectra were recorded. From Fig. 6 a, it is evident that TO essentially responded to the UV region. However, the visible light absorption of TO@NRGO was significantly increased due to co-doping with N doped RGO. TO@NRGO had broad and wide absorption owing to its narrow band-gap. TO@NRGO showed an improved light absorption than TO, indicating that the introduction of NRGO can enhance the visible light absorption, hence enhancing the photocatalytic activity. The plots of the modified Kubelka–Munkfactor v/s the light energy was given in Fig. 6b. The bandgap values of TO and TO@NRGO were 4.08 and 2.5 eV, respectively. The results indicated that the introduction of N doped RGO can enhance the visible light absorption of TO@NRGO."
9,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"3.1 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution The synthesized materials were subjected to photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen through water splitting in a tetraethanolamine (TEOA) system under Xe lamp irradiation. The hydrogen gas evolution in presence of different materials for 3 h is given in Fig. 7 a. When NRGO and TO were used as a photocatalyst, evolved hydrogen gas was found to be 9000 and 10,500 µmol g−1, respectively. The hydrogen evolution was doubled when TO@NRGO is used as a photocatalyst and it is found to be 19,500 µmol g−1. The synergistic effect between NRGO and TO could be attributed to the enhanced photocatalytic activity. An important feature of the catalyst for its practical applications is stability. Recyclability studies for TO@NRGO nanocomposite have been evaluated and results are depicted in Fig. 7b. Every run was constituted for 3 h. For the first two runs in presence of TO@NRGO and light, the hydrogen evolution was almost the same without much decline in its activity. A trivial decrease in the catalytic performance was observed during the 3rd and 4th run probably due to the lowered concentration of the sacrificial agent. Hence, a fresh sacrificial agent was added and performed 5th cycle of the catalytic process, even then the TO@NRGO managed to evolve 17,900 µmol g−1 of H2. This clearly shows the good stability of the TO@NRGO hybrid upon evacuation after each run and the regular addition of fresh sacrificial agent."
10,Photocatalytic degradation of dye,"3.2 Photocatalytic degradation of dye The ability of NRGO, TO and TO@NRGO nanocomposite was further evaluated for degradation of dyes under solar light illumination. The absorption spectra of individual MB and RhB (10 mg L−1) are given in Fig. 8 a and b. It is observed that the intensity of the absorption maxima decreased progressively with the increase in time of light illumination due to the breakdown of dye molecules. The corresponding percentage degradation of MB and RhB under different conditions is depicted in Fig. 8c. The decolouration of the dyes under dark conditions and in presence of a photocatalyst is almost nil. When NRGO is used as a catalyst in presence of light, the degradation of MB and RhB is found to be 35 and 38%, respectively at a time of 100 min. A slight increase in the degradation of dyes is observed in presence of TO and light and found 54 and 58% for MB and RhB, respectively. A high degradation of both the dyes was observed when the TO@NRGO nanocomposite is used as a catalyst under the illumination of light. The % degradation of 10 mg L−1 of MB and RhB in presence of 30 mg of TO@NRGO and at pH 11 is found to be 94 and 88 for 100 min. Additionally, the catalytic performance of NRGO is high compared to RGO as given in Fig. S2 (details are given in supplementary file). Also, there is a probability of generating charge distribution and asymmetric spin upon doping of N to RGO and enhances photocatalytic activity. The photo-induced charge separation, migration, and collection of electrons are greatly improved by strengthening the interfacial interactions due to the formation of p-n heterojunction between TO and NRGO. The main reason for the enhanced degradation capacity of TO@NRGO is attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption capacity. This increased capacity of visible light absorption of the nanocomposite is due to the synergistic effect between TO and NRGO and also due to lowered bandgap of 2.5 eV on functionalization with NRGO as well as enhanced surface area. To achieve the maximum degradation efficiency of the catalysts; various reaction conditions were optimized carefully. The pH of the degradation medium plays a vital role as the catalysts help for the adsorption of dyes on their active site. The degradation of MB and RhB at different pH from 3 to 13 in presence of 30 mg of TO@NRGO and 10 mg L−1 concentration of dyes for 100 min, 0.1 M NaOH and HCl are used to adjust the pH. In Fig. 9 a, it is observed that the degradation of both MB and RhB dyes was found to increase with a rise in the pH value from acidic to alkaline. The maximum degradation % of MB and RhB is found at pH 11, on further increasing the pH to 13 no change in the degradation of dyes is observed; hence pH of 11 is fixed for the efficient degradation of both the dyes. Both MB and RhB are cationic dyes and tend to exhibit maximum degradation when the catalyst surface exhibits negative charges. Further, the initial concentration of MB and RhB dyes were varied from 10 to 40 mg L−1 in presence of 30 mg of TO@NRGO and at pH 11 for 100 min and is given in Fig. 9b. The maximum degradation of MB and RhB was observed at 10 mg L−1 initial concentration. It is observed that, the % degradation of both the dyes declines with the increase in its concentration. As the concentration of dyes increases, it leads to the screening effect of dyes on the catalyst, i.e. the catalyst experiences less availability of light compared to dyes at high concentration. Further studies were carried out using a 10 mg L−1 concentration of both dyes. The amount of catalyst for the effective degradation of dyes under light is another key factor that affects their degradation efficiency. To fix the amount of catalyst dosage, the amount of TO@NRGO varied from 10 to 50 mg in presence of light at pH 11 and the concentration of MB and RhB was kept at 10 mg L−1. It is observed that (Fig. 9c), the degradation of both MB and RhB tends to increase with an increase in the catalyst dosage from 10 to 30 mg. Further increase in the catalyst dosage to 40 and 50 mg resulted in a decrease in the % degradation of both the dyes. The efficiency of the catalyst up to certain level increases due to the availability of more active sites which further enhances the yield of active species involved in degradation. Due to the formation of an opaque photosystem, the penetration of the light decreases on a further increase in the amount of catalyst. The main active species responsible for the degradation of dyes have been examined using scavenger studies under optimized conditions. The scavengers used are ammonium oxalate (AO), benzoic acid (BA), and p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) for h+, OH and O2 − elimination, respectively. The degradation of both MB and RhB (10 mg L−1 each) dyes was carried out in presence of light, 30 mg TO@NRGO and at pH 11, and the results are depicted in Fig. 9d. In presence of AO, the % degradation of MB and RhB were found to be 93 and 87% and indicates the no involvement of h+ as active species for degradation phenomena. But the degradation % of MB and RhB decreased considerably to 49 and 51%, respectively in presence of p-BQ indicate O2 − the molecule is the active species responsible for the degradation of both the dyes. The degradation of both dyes decreased furthermore in presence of BA and the degradation of MB and RhB was found to be 28 and 26%, respectively. These scavenger study results indicate OH and superoxide radical anion is responsible for the degradation of both the dyes under optimized conditions. The DMPO ESR spin-trapping experiment gives more insights into the mechanism for simultaneous photocatalytic degradation MB and RhB at TO@NRGO composite and the degradation depends largely on the formation of radical intermediates such as O2 −/HO2 and OH. To evaluate the involvement of these radicals, 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was used as a probe, which gives many stable and detectable radicals. Experimental investigations (Fig. 10 a &b) proved the formation of the characteristic quartet peaks and hyperfine split peaks corresponding to OH and O2 − radicals under visible light irradiation during photocatalysis. From the figures, it is evident that an increase in irradiation time increased the production of hydroxyl radicals. As demonstrated, the photo-generated electrons in TO could be transferred to the narrow band of NRGO. These electrons on NRGO will lead to the reduction of O2 to give O2 − radicals. Generation of OH radicals will occur via the interaction of the OH−/H2O with the valence band hole in the material (OH− + h+ → OH)."
11,Optical and electrochemical studies,"3.3 Optical and electrochemical studies Photoluminescence (PL) studies of TO and TO@NRGO have been carried out and its PL spectra at room temperature are given in Fig. 11 a. The PL spectrum of TO shows two asymmetric peaks centred at 566.2 nm and 567.4 nm and possesses green light emissions due to photo-induced electron-hole pair recombination. These, two peaks of TO have been retained even after anchoring NRGO to it but observed a slight red shift and decrease in the PL intensity because of effective separation of light-driven charge carriers resulting in lower recombination of electron-hole pairs. To better understand the generation and transfer of photo-induced carriers in the photocatalysts, electrochemical performance evaluation has been conducted [58]. Fig. 11b indicates the transient current density as a function of time with the light on/off conditions. A current density is detected for all the three photocatalysts used; TO, NRGO and TO@NRGO. But TO@NRGO is exhibiting high current density, which in turn tells about the enhanced generation of photo-induced electrons."
12,Simultaneous degradation of MB and RhB,"3.4 Simultaneous degradation of MB and RhB Additionally, TO@NRGO nanocomposite photocatalytic efficiency has been evaluated for simultaneous degradation of MB and RhB. Both dyes of concentration 10 mg L−1 each were mixed in of 1:1 ratio and subjected to photocatalysis in presence of 30 mg of TO@NRGO nanocomposite, pH 11 for a time of 100 min. The absorption spectrum of mixed dye is given in Fig. 12 . The λmax for MB and RhB in the mixture remains unchanged. The corresponding % degradation of mixed dye is calculated using Eq. (1). In a mixed dye, the maximum degradation of MB is found to be 92% and RhB is 89.5% (inset: Fig. 12). The degrading capacity of TO@NRGO nanocomposite for mixed dyes is almost similar to individual dyes under optimum conditions."
13,Mechanistic investigation,"3.5 Mechanistic investigation The mechanism involved in the photocatalytic process could be explained based on results of DRS studies, scavenger studies, and ESR experiments. The scavenger study results suggest superoxide radical anion and OH are responsible for the degradation of both MB and RhB. On this basis, a plausible mechanism of dye degradation is given Scheme 1 . From the literature, it is observed that the pristine TO nanoparticle CB potential is found to −0.48 eV and its VB potential is + 3.6 eV and the bandgap is found to be 4.08 eV. Bandgap in semiconductors plays a major role in deciding its activity under UV, visible, and IR regions [57–59]. Solar energy could be utilized in a better way if a semiconductor possesses a bandgap less than 3.0 eV. The synthesized TO is one such metal-oxide having a wide bandgap and not visible active material. Hence, the bandgap of TO has been reduced successfully on blending with nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide. From the reported work it is proved that N doped RGO shows enhanced electrical conductivity compared to RGO due to lowered defects in the graphitic structure and well-organized structural restoration. N atoms present in the graphitic structure also acts as an electron donor and release more electrons. As expected, the bandgap in TO@NRGO is reduced to 2.5 eV and thus the nanocomposite enables absorption of light under the visible region. Upon irradiating sunlight on TO@NRGO, the electrons in the VB of TO undergoes photoexcitation as a result, the electrons are excited to CB leaving behind the holes in the VB then the VB electrons of TO semiconductor are excited to the CB, leaving holes in the VB, thus leading to the generation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. The electrons in the CB of TO easily jump to NRGO which shows good electrical conductivity further increases the charge separation, easy collection, and migration of electrons. The electrons in the CB of TO@NRGO are well utilized by O2 and undergo photoreduction to form superoxide radical anion further reacts with water and generate hydroxyl radicals and finally degrades the MB and RhB to CO2 and H2O. On the other hand, the h+ present in the nanocomposite tends to react with water and generate OH ., which finally helps in the degradation of dyes to form non-toxic products. The schematic representation of the degradation mechanism of MB and RhB is given in Fig. 13 ."
14,Reusability studies,"3.6 Reusability studies For the real-time application of any catalyst the basic property, it should possess is stability and reusability. The TO@NRGO nanocomposite has been subjected to degradation of MB and RhB in presence of light and other optimized reaction conditions. After the first run, TO@NRGO was centrifuged and washed thrice with distilled water to remove dyes. The left-out photocatalyst was subjected to vacuum dry for 4 h at 85 °C and used for successive photocatalytic degradation runs. Fig. 14 indicates TO@NRGO exhibits very good stability even after the 5th run and managed to degrade 85% of MB and 80% of RhB."
15,Conclusions,"A simple precipitation method followed by hydrothermal treatment has been employed for the synthesis of δTO and its anchoring with NRGO. TO@NRGO showed enhanced photocatalytic activity due to a decrease in the bandgap and enhanced electrical conductivity of NRGO for easy charge separation, collection, and migration of electrons. Satisfactory evolution of H2 has been observed for TO@NRGO in presence of UV light. The electrochemical studies showed that TO@NRGO in presence of light exhibits high current density due to improved generation of photo-induced electrons. TO@NRGO was successfully used as a catalyst to degrade MB and RhB simultaneously with good stability and reusability and satisfied the basic requirement of Industrial catalysts. Hence, TO@NRGO could serve as a multipurpose material for solving the issues related to energy harvesting, storage, and environmental applications."
