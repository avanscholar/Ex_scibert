0,Introduction,"The need of light weight, low cost and safety improvement of modern automobile has spurred increased interest in the development of advanced high strength steels (AHSSs). In recent years, AHSS sheets with ultimate tensile strength (UTS) over 1000 MPa grade have been increasingly used to manufacture many automobile body parts for the purpose of achieving further weight reduction and improving the impact safety of vehicles [1–3]. However, there is an increasing danger that hydrogen-induced degradation of mechanical properties, often terms hydrogen embrittlement (HE), due to hydrogen absorbed during product production and/or lifecycle might occur under service environments with increasing steel strength grade for structural steels [4–6]. The susceptibility to HE could represent one of the main limitations to the application of higher strength AHHS sheets in the auto body-in-white and therefore, increasing studies have been carried out both experimentaly and numerically on the HE behavior of AHSSs in recent years [5–16]. Although no consensus about the basic mechanisms responsible for HE is reached yet, two mechanisms, that is, hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) [17,18] and hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) [19], have been advanced as the more accepted and cited ones for the case of hydrogen-related degradation in steel in literature [13]. The HELP mechanism proposes a hydrogen-promoted dislocation mobility and planar slip around a crack tip and usually accounts for highly localized plastic-like deformation in fracture surfaces and slip-band cracking [9,18]. However, there exists contradictory results and there is no direct connection between this mechanism and actual embrittlement [15]. The HEDE mechanism postulates that interstitial hydrogen lowers the cohesive bond strength between the metal atoms by dilatation of the atomic lattice and causes brittle cracking in the absence of significant local deformation [9,20]. Practically, sometimes a synergistic action of these proposed mechanisms may be responsible for degradation and embrittlement of steel rather a single one [20,21]. Recently, a novel and unified HELP + HEDE model concerning the synergistic action of hydrogen-enhanced plasticity and decohesion in steels was proposed, and the dominance of one of the mechanism (HELP or HEDE) depends on the hydrogen concentration and the material-stress state-environment factors [20,22,23]. Medium-Mn steel has recently been suggested as one promising candidate for the third generation AHSS for its excellent strength-ductility balance [24–26]. The most widely studied microstructure of this type of steel consists of ultrafine grained ferrite and retained austenite (RA), which is usually obtained by austenite reverted transformation (ART) annealing in the α + γ region [27,28]. RA is a key factor in governing the excellent mechanical properties of medium-Mn steel, which generally originate from the transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) effect of RA providing persistent work-hardening and postponed localized deformation [24–26]. As the UTS of medium-Mn steels reported in literature is normally ranges from ~900 MPa to 1500 MPa [24,25], it raises concerns of a susceptibility to HE. Moreover, due to inevitable plastic deformation during the fabrication processes of automotive parts, a portion of the high fraction metastable RA might transform to martensite [24,29,30]. Thus, considering that the transformed fresh untempered martensite is most susceptible to HE as well as the higher strength level, it is regarded that medium-Mn steels might be more vulnerable to the hydrogen compared with conventional TRIP steels and special attention should be given [24]. However, only a few works have been focused on this problem till now [30–38]. These existing investigations clearly demonstrate that this type of steel exhibited a relatively high susceptibility to HE. For example, a HE index (relative total elongation (TEL) loss, HEI) of 64.9% was obtained in a cold-rolled 0.2C–4.9Mn–3.1Al–0.6Si (all in wt%) steel when it was intercritically annealed at the temperature obtaining maximum strength-ductility balance [36]. Similar HEI of 74–87% was also found in a 0.1C–7Mn steel [31]. Therefore, it is really necessary to explore methods of alleviating the susceptibility to HE of this type of steel. Elevated temperatures might be experienced during the manufacturing and in service applications of medium-Mn steel sheets, for example, automotive steel sheets are usually heated up to ~170 °C in the paint baking process and as high as ~400–500 °C for the galvanizing in order to improve the corrosion resistance [39]. It has been long known the beneficial influence of tempering treatment on enhancing the resistance to HE of high-strength steels [40–44]. However, until now, no reports have explored the influence of tempering on the HE behavior of medium-Mn steels. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of different tempering treatment (200–500 °C) in alleviating the HE susceptibility of one extensively studied and least alloyed medium-Mn steel with ~5 wt% Mn by electrochemical hydrogen-charging and slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) testing."
1,Experimental material and methods,"The material used was an industrial trial of hot-rolled 6-mm-thick sheets of medium-Mn steel (0.1C-5Mn) with its chemical composition listed in Table 1 . Its critical temperatures of A e1 and A e3 calculated based on the Thermal-Calc (TCFE8) software are also presented in Table 1. For the purpose of homogenizing the initial microstructure, the hot-rolled sheets were soaked at 800 °C for 30 min, quenched in an oil bath. After quenching, the sheets were ART-annealed at 650 °C for 30 min followed by air cooling. The selection of this ART-annealing parameter was based on previous investigations of similar medium-Mn steels [27,35]. Subsequently, a part of the sheets were tempered at 200 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C for 60 min and then air cooled to ambient temperature. Fig. 1 gives the schematic diagram of the heat treatment schedule. Flat tensile specimens (1.5 mm thickness, 5 mm width and 15 mm gauge length) were cut longitudinally to the prior rolling direction using a wire cutting machine. These specimens which were cut from the 200 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C tempered sheets were hereafter referred to as the AT200, AT400 and AT500 according to the tempering temperature (T temp), respectively. Hydrogen was electrochemically charged into the specimens in an aqueous solution of 0.25 mol/L H2SO4 containing 0.5 g/L thiourea at 0.2 mA/cm2 for 60 min at ambient temperature. SSRT tests were conducted at a nominal strain rate of 4.2 × 10−5 s−1 for both the hydrogen-charged and uncharged specimens. The hydrogen-charged specimens were tensile strained within 10 min after hydrogen-charging and the total testing duration time was no longer than 120 min. Each test was repeated at least three times. HE index (HEI), which was defined as the relative TEL loss, is expressed as: (1) HEI % = 1 - TEL H / TEL 0 × 100 % where TEL0 and TELH are the TEL for the uncharged and hydrogen-charged specimens, respectively. Hydrogen content was measured by thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS) at a heating rate of 100 °C/h. According to ISO 17801–2004(E) standard, a modified Devanathan-Stachurski device was used to conduct the electrochemical hydrogen permeation tests. The device includes two parts: a hydrogen charging side, which contained 0.25 mol/L H2SO4 solution with 0.5 g/L thiourea, and a hydrogen oxidation detection side, which contained 0.1 mol/L NaOH aqueous solution. Details of the tests see reference [45]. The following equation was used to calculate the effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient (D eff) [45]: (2) D eff = L 2 / 6 t L where L is the sample thickness (1 mm), t L is the time-lag defined as 0.63 times the steady-state current in the permeation curve. Microstructure characterization was performed using a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at an operating voltage of 200 kV. An alcohol solution with 5% perchloric acid was used for the preparation of TEM thin foils in a twin-jet electropolishing apparatus. X-rays diffraction (XRD) was used to analysis the volume fraction of RA using a Cu-Kα X-ray source. After standard grinding and polishing, the surfaces normal to the rolling direction and the fractured surfaces of the SSRT specimens were etched in a 3% nital solution for cracks observation by an optical microscopy (OM) and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) operating at 20 kV. The fracture surfaces of the fractured specimens were also observed by SEM."
2,Results,
3,Microstructural characteristics,"3.1 Microstructural characteristics The TEM micrographs of the tested steel sheets ART-annealed and tempered at different temperatures are presented in Fig. 2 . All the specimens exhibit an ultrafine duplex microstructure consisting of black- and white-colored laths and blocks (Fig. 2(a), 2(c) and 2(d)). The analysis of selected area diffraction (SAD) patterns further identified that the white-colored lath is ferrite phase while the black-colored is RA [27,35]. This primarily lath-shaped microstructure is mainly because the reverted austenite grew along the original martensitic laths and block boundaries before the recrystallization of the martensitic matrix [31], as was also found in other hot-rolled/forged and ART-annealed medium-Mn steels [27,28,31,35]. XRD analysis shows that the RA fraction is 18.6 vol% for the ATR-annealed specimen, and then an increase in T temp leads to a gradual decrease of the RA fraction as shown Fig. 3 ; especially when the specimen was tempered at 500 °C, the large blocky-type RA became thermally unstable and decomposed in situ into a mixture of ferrite and cementite particles (Fig. 2(f)), causing a remarkable decrease (~6.6 vol%) of the RA fraction. It is noteworthy that there are many rod-shaped cementite particles precipitated along the ferritic lath boundaries and within the laths in the ART-annealed specimen, as was also found in previous investigations of short time ART-annealed 0.1C-5Mn and 0.2C-5Mn steels [27,35,46]. Both TEM observations and numerical simulations showed that the precipitation of cementite during the ART-annealing treatment of Mn-alloyed martensitic steels seems to be unavoidable [47,48]; more explanations about this phenomenon are detailed in our previous work [46]. During the subsequent tempering process, the cementite particles retained in the ART-annealed specimen grew gradually, while new cementite particles precipitated simultaneously (Fig. 2(c), 2(d) and 2(e))."
4,Hydrogen desorption and permeation behavior,"3.2 Hydrogen desorption and permeation behavior Fig. 4 (a) gives typical thermal desorption curves of the hydrogen-charged ART-annealed and tempered specimens. All the curves exhibit a significant low-temperature peak at around 130 °C and a weak high-temperature peak at around 370 °C. This type of hydrogen desorption curve is similar to those of other medium-Mn steels in literature [30–36]. Moreover, the low-temperature peak temperature (T PI) of the ART-annealed, AT200, AT400 and AT500 are 136 °C, 128 °C, 112 °C and 110 °C, respectively, i.e., it tends to decrease with an increase in T temp. This result indicates that the hydrogen trap activation energy of the low-temperature peak exhibits a decreasing tendency with increasing T temp. An in-depth analysis of the peak of desorption curve of a 0.1C-7Mn-0.5Si steel with dual-phase microstructure of RA + ferrite revealed that its low-temperature desorption peak could be separated into two different peaks corresponding to α phase with lower peak temperature of ~65 °C and to γ phase with higher peak temperature of ~110 °C [31]. Therefore, the decrease of the RA fraction with an increase in T temp is mainly responsible for the decrease of the T PI. It is usually regarded that hydrogen released lower than ~300 °C is responsible for the HE of high-strength steels [49,50]. Thus, the hydrogen which desorbed up to 300 °C was defined as diffusible or weak trapped hydrogen (H D). Obviously, almost all the hydrogen of each specimen corresponds to H D. Fig. 4(b) presents the variations of H D of the tested specimens at as-ART-annealed and tempered conditions. For the uncharged specimens, the H D of the ART-annealed is ~0.1 ppm, and it remains almost unchanged with an increase in T temp. For the hydrogen-charged specimens, the H D of the ART-annealed is 2.17 ppm; there is a slight variation of H D for the AT200, AT400 and AT500 specimens. Fig. 5 shows the hydrogen permeation curve of the ART-annealed specimen. The obtained D eff is 2.92 × 10−7 cm2/s, which is rather close to the one in low-alloy martensitic steels (D eff = 3.70 × 10−7 cm2/s) [31]. The obtained D eff is much higher than that in duplex stainless steels with ~40–50 vol% austenite (D eff ≈ 10−11–10−9 cm2/s) [51]. This is can be explained as follow. For the ART-annealed specimen, its RA fraction (18.6 vol%) is much lower than ferrite, so the RA is embedded in the ferritic matrix. As ferrite has much higher hydrogen diffusivity than austenite, the three-dimensional ferritic network would provide an efficient and quick path for hydrogen transport [37], and thus the influence of the RA on hydrogen diffusivity would be rather limited. Based on (6Dt)1/2 [35] and a charging time of 60 min, the hydrogen diffusion distance can be estimated to be 0.79 mm, which is slightly larger than the half-thickness (0.75 mm) of the tested sheet specimen. Therefore, it is regarded that a steady-state hydrogen distribution was established within the tested specimens."
5,HE susceptibility,"3.3 HE susceptibility Fig. 6 (a) gives the typical engineering stress-strain curves of the tested steel at different conditions. For the uncharged specimens, the UTS increases slightly while the TEL decreases with increasing T temp, which are more notable for the AT500 specimen. This result is mainly related to the thermal stability of the RA during tempering treatment, and it is referred to reference [46] for details about this variation of tensile properties with T temp. The engineering strain was lowered after hydrogen-charging, and this decreasing tendency is more remarkable for the ART-annealed and lower temperature tempered specimens. The hydrogen-charged ART-annealed and AT200 specimens exhibited significant premature fracture without necking. As shown in Fig. 6(b), it is clear that the susceptibility to HE evaluated by the relative TEL loss (HEI) decreases significantly with increasing T temp. This result reveals that the susceptibility to HE is most significant for the ART-annealed specimen, while tempering treatment can significantly alleviate it. For the AT500 specimen, its HEI is lower than 5%, suggesting that it is almost immune to HE."
6,HE fracture surface characteristics,"3.4 HE fracture surface characteristics Both the macroscopic and microscopic SSRT tensile fracture surfaces were carefully observed by SEM to clarify the cause of the degradation of mechanical properties for the tested steel due to hydrogen. The fractographs of both the uncharged and hydrogen-charged ART-annealed specimens are shown in Fig. 7 . The fracture surface is rough and shows noticeable necking for the uncharged specimen (Fig. 7(a)), while the fracture surface is more even and exhibits limited necking for the hydrogen-charged one (Fig. 7(c)). Further SEM examination with high magnification revealed that the facture is primarily characterized by fine dimples, revealing a ductile fracture mode for the uncharged (Fig. 7(b)). For the hydrogen-charged specimen, however, there are some flat fractured areas in the edges of the fracture surface (region I) (Fig. 7(c)). These flat fractured areas are primarily characterized by hydrogen-induced quasi-cleavage (QC) fracture mixed with intergranular fracture (IG) and some secondary cracks (Fig. 7(d)), which is an indication of loss of ductility and is consistent with the SSRT result shown in Fig. 6. The region next to these flat areas (region II) are mainly QC fracture with some secondary cracks and shallow dimples (Fig. 7(e)), while the central part of the fracture surface (region III) is a mixed mode fracture of empty dimples and dimples filled with grains (Fig. 7(f,g)). As seen from Fig. 8 (a), the fraction of the brittle flat area notably decreases for the hydrogen-charged AT200 specimen compared with that of the ART-annealed one (Fig. 7(c)). The fraction of the brittle flat area further decreases for AT400 specimen (Fig. 8(c)), while it nearly disappeared for the AT500 specimen (Fig. 8(e)). The fracture surfaces of the flat fractured area are dominated by QC fracture for the hydrogen-charged AT200 and AT400 specimens (Fig. 8(b) and 8(d)), while the fracture mode is primarily ductile dimple fracture for the hydrogen-charged AT500 (Fig. 8 (f))."
7,Hydrogen-induced crack initiation and propagation,"3.5 Hydrogen-induced crack initiation and propagation The surface normal to the rolling and fracture surface as illustrated in Fig. 9 (a) was observed by OM in an attempt to unveil the underlying hydrogen influences with respect to microstructure. As shown in Fig. 9(b), many macroscopic cracks can be observed at both edges of the fractured SSRT specimens except the AT500. The number of cracks decreases with an increase in T temp and no cracks can be found in the AT500 specimen. Fig. 10 (a) and 10(b) show that some successive large cracks indicating the crack propagation are also found in the center region neighborhood to the facture surface of the hydrogen-charged ART-annealed specimen. Further observation of the microstructure ahead of the crack tip showed that it seems likely that voids were primarily initiated at the interphase boundaries between RA (martensite) and ferrite as shown in Fig. 10(c) and 10(d), whereas no voids can be found within the ferrite. It should be noted that during ART-annealing, the reverted austenite was preferentially nucleated at prior austenite grain boundaries, thus part of the voids were also initiated at and propagated along the prior austenite grain boundaries (Fig. 10(c)), which was also found by Han et al. [31]. Thus the fracture mode of the hydrogen-charged ART-annealed specimen is mixed with intergranular fracture as shown in Fig. 7(d). In contrast, no cracks can be found in the center region neighborhood to the facture surface of the AT500 specimen (Fig. 11 (a) and 11(b)), although much fine voids were still found to be primarily located at the RA/ferrite interfaces, but these voids seemed staying isolated from each other and did not form cracks (Fig. 11(c))."
8,Discussion,
9,Influence of tempering treatment on HE susceptibility,"4.1 Influence of tempering treatment on HE susceptibility It is widely regarded that increasing steel strength level usually causes an increase in HE susceptibility [12,52]. A systematic investigation of the HE of several high-strength steels with different microstructures and hardness (strength) levels ranging from 327 to 544 HVN revealed that the foremost factor influencing the HE susceptibility is strength level [52]. However, numerous experimental and practical results show that this general tendency is true especially for UTS being higher than about 1000 MPa [53], which suggests that strength is not the only primary factor influencing the HE of various steels with lower strength level, that is to say, the microstructure of such steels plays a predominant role [54]. The experimental results of this research reveal that the AT500 specimen exhibits the lowest value of HEI, although it has the highest strength level (~840 MPa) (Fig. 6(a)). Therefore, other factors should be considered for the explanation of this experimental result. When T temp is lower than ~400 °C, it is still a little lower to permit the necessary large diffusion of carbon, and thus the thinning of the RA laths primarily accounts for the slight decrease of the RA fraction [46]. There is a notable decrease of the RA fraction primarily due to the decomposing of the large block RA when the steel was tempered at 500 °C. Therefore, as mentioned in section 3.1, the significant microstructural changes during tempering of the ART-annealed specimen could be regarded as the evolution of the RA and cementite particles. It has been confirmed that both RA and cementite particles are strong hydrogen traps and the trap activation energy of hydrogen desorption of RA is higher than that of cementite [4,55–57], thus it causes a decreasing of T PI with increasing T temp (Fig. 4). Therefore, during subsequent hydrogen-charging, the decrease of the RA fraction causes a decrease of the H D trapped by RA with increasing T temp, while the increase of the amount of cementite particles causes an increase of the H D. Thus, the H D remains almost unchanged with increasing T temp up to 500 °C (Fig. 4(b)). Moreover, it is rational to suppose that more and more hydrogen was trapped by cementite particles with increasing T temp considering the nearly unchanged H D and the decreasing RA fraction. It has been pointed out that metastable RA which transforms to martensite during deformation is detrimental to the resistance to HE primarily because the hydrogen trapped by RA was inherited into martensite and hydrogen-enriched fresh martensite was so brittle that it provided a nucleation site for micro-crack [30,31,45]. That is to say, TRIP effect is detrimental to the resistance to HE of TRIP-assisted high-strength steels. After the SSRT tests, the remaining RA fractions are less than 3% (Fig. 3(c)), i.e., most of the RA (>85%) transformed to martensite. It is obvious that the transformed RA fraction decreases with increasing T temp (Fig. 3(c)), for example, the volume fractions of transformed RA are 16.8%, 11.2% for the ART-annealed and AT500 specimens, respectively. This is mainly because the thinning of the lath width of the RA with increasing T temp increases its mechanical stability [46]. Given that most cracks are associated with the martensitic transformation, the susceptibility to HE decreases with increasing T temp as revealed in Fig. 6. And more importantly, the large blocky-type RA, which primarily nucleated along prior austenite grain boundaries (Fig. 2), transformed to martensite at the early stage of the SSRT test, and thus would promote the crack initiation and propagation in the presence of hydrogen as shown in Fig. 10. Thus, it is the large blocky-type RA which is mainly responsible for the IG fracture of the ART-annealed specimen, as was also pointed out by Han et al. [31]. Therefore, the decrease of the fraction of the RA especially the large blocky-type RA due to its lower thermal stability with an increase in T temp causes a decrease of the fraction of brittle IG fracture (Figs. 7 and 8) and thus enhanced resistance to HE. In addition to the change of the RA, tempering treatment also changed the characteristics of carbide of the tested steel. As the precipitation of cementite particles during the ART-annealing of Mn-alloyed martensitic steel seems to be unavoidable [47,48], a short duration of intercritical annealing (30 min) at 650 °C would unavoidable lead to undissolved cementite particles as shown in Fig. 2(b). During the subsequent tempering treatment, these cementite particles grew gradually, while new cementite particles would precipitate along ferritic lath boundaries or within laths or through the decomposition of the RA by a diffusion mechanism or directly from the RA at a higher T temp (Fig. 2(c)-2(f)). This process is similar to that of the tempering process of quenched martensitic steel, and thus is beneficial to the enhancement of the HE resistance of the tested steel [40,52,55]. Moreover, the increasing uniform distribution of fine cementite particles could also improve the HE resistance under plastic deformation as it would change the state of hydrogen trap at cementite, i.e., from low-energy to high-energy by forming strained interfaces between matrix and cementite [58]."
10,Influence of tempering treatment on HE fracture surface characteristics,"4.2 Influence of tempering treatment on HE fracture surface characteristics As shown in Fig. 7, the SSRT fracture surface of the ART-annealed specimen could be roughly divided into three regions. As for the flat brittle region near the specimen surface (region I), it is macroscopic brittle transgranular (TG) with the presence of IG and some secondary cracks. As mentioned above, the existence of large block-type RA is mainly responsible for the IG fracture in the presence of hydrogen. This is because the preferred enriched hydrogen would reduce the cohesive bonding energy between lattice atoms, that is to say, the IG fracture mode is due to the predominant decohesion – HEDE mechanism activity initiated due to high local hydrogen concentration in the vicinity of specimen surface [20,59]. As for the inward region next to region I (region II), it is a mixed fracture of brittle QC and ductile microvoid coalescence (MVC). The local MVC fracture indicates localized plasticity and theHELP mechanism activity, and this is in the accordance with the HELP + HEDE model about the synergistic action of both HELP and HEDE mechanism [20]. As for the central part of the fracture surface (region III), one significant characteristic is the presence of a small fraction of dimples filled with grains besides pure ductile empty dimples, the former was also found in other medium-Mn steels [31,33,34,36]. It has been verified that these “grains” are deformation-induced martensites from the RA and this type of fracture is initiated by IG cracking along the RA grain boundaries and/or the interfaces of RA and ferrite in the presence of hydrogen by the HEDE mechanism [31,33,34,36]. Thus, dimples filled with grains are by nature an IG fracture. From above considerations, it is seen that the HEDE mechanism dominates in region I (HEDE > HELP), the HELP mechanism dominates in region III (HELP > HEDE), and the synergistic action of both HELP and HEDE mechanism in the transition area (region II) (HELP + HEDE). The transition between HE mechanisms depends on hydrogen concentration and applied stress conditions [20]. The decrease of the metastable RA fraction with increasing T temp causes the decrease of the fraction of region I (Figs. 7 and 8), and when the steel was tempered at 500 °C, it almost disappeared (Fig. 8). More detailed studies are still necessary to clarify this HE fracture mechanism in medium-Mn steels."
11,Influence of tempering treatment on strength-ductility balance,"4.3 Influence of tempering treatment on strength-ductility balance The product of UTS to TEL (UTS × TEL) is now widely adopted to assess the strength and ductility combination of AHSSs for automobiles, and the target value of UTS × TEL for the third-generation AHSS grades is higher than ~30 GPa·% [1,26]. As seen from Table 2 , almost all the values of UTS × TEL meet that requirement for the T temp range investigated although it slightly decreases with increasing T temp. Interestingly, the decrease of the value of HEI is much more significant compared to the slight decrease tendency of the value of UTS × TEL. For example, the increase of T temp up to 200 °C leads to a 48.8% decrease of HEI while only a 4.3% decrease of the value of UTS × TEL; the increase of T temp up to 500 °C leads to a 94.2% decrease of HEI while only a 10.7% decrease of the value of UTS × TEL. This result suggests that low temperature tempering like that used in the paint baking process could notably lower the susceptibility to HE, and that high temperature tempering like that used in the galvanizing process could significantly reducing the susceptibility to HE or even make it immune to HE. It should be noted that the HEI of the ART-annealed specimen (~62%) of the present study is similar to those of the hot/cold-rolled plus ART-annealed (74–87%) of a 0.1C–7Mn steel [31], which indicates that a risk to HE fracture might exist for the ART-annealed medium-Mn steels. It is thus proposed that tempering treatment combining with paint baking and/or galvanizing processes might provide a promising way to lower the susceptibility to HE of medium-Mn steels with relatively lower decreasing in the strength-ductility balance, although further investigation is still needed."
12,Conclusions,"(1) The susceptibility to HE evaluated by the relative total elongation loss decreases continuously with increasing T temp, and it is nearly immune to HE for the specimen tempered at 500 °C. The diffusible hydrogen contents for both uncharged and hydrogen-charged specimens remain almost unchanged with increasing T temp up to 500 °C. These results are ascribed primarily to the microstructural evolution of the RA and cementite during tempering. (2) The SSRT fracture surface of the ART-annealed specimen can be divided into three regions with different fracture characteristics including IG, QC and MVC fracture, and corresponding HE mechanism changes from HEDE dominates to the synergistic action of both HELP and HEDE mechanism to HELP dominates from specimen surface layer to interior. The fraction of the brittle fracture especially IG fracture decreases with an increase in T temp, while it nearly disappeared with further increasing T temp up to 500 °C. (3) A novel strategy is proposed, i.e., tempering treatment after ART-annealing might provide a promising way to lower the HE susceptibility of medium-Mn steel at little expense of lowering its strength-ductility balance, and this treatment could be combined with the paint baking and/or galvanizing processes usually applied to enhance the corrosion resistance of automotive steel sheets."
