0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered a promising clean fuel and energy carrier due to its CO2-free combustion. Hydrogen can be produced from a wide variety of feedstocks and energy sources. As a consequence, a significant number of technologies and processes can be found nowadays for hydrogen production with different degree of maturity [1]. Among them, the most interesting ones are those based on the use of renewable or sustainable energy sources and feedstocks, such as biohydrogen, thermochemical or photocatalytic solar water splitting and photoelectrolysis. Nevertheless, these systems are still very far from being competitive, so much more research effort must be performed to achieve their large-scale applicability. Currently, most of the hydrogen production comes from fossil fuels, mainly by steam reforming of natural gas (SMR), which is characterized by significant emissions of greenhouse gases. In this way, by means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), it has been determined that the use of systems of capture and sequestration of the CO2 emitted by hydrocarbon reforming may involve a high energy consumption, with significant damages to the environment in terms of acidification, production of heavy metals and winter smog [2]. Despite having lower H2 production per mol of methane molecule consumed than SMR, methane decomposition (DeCH4) is an interesting alternative since this reaction yields only hydrogen and solid carbon, according to the following reaction scheme [3]: CH 4 ( g ) → C ( s ) + 2 H 2 ( g ) Δ H ° = 75.6 kJ / mol Consequently, no direct CO x emissions to the environment occur. Moreover, this endothermic reaction requires only 37.8 kJ to produce one mol of hydrogen, while 69 kJ/mol H2 are consumed by SMR. However, thermal decomposition of methane requires very elevated temperatures, in the range 1100–1400 °C. In order to reduce the reaction temperature, as well as to enhance the kinetics of the process, a great effort is being put on the development of suitable catalysts for methane decomposition. First, most attention was paid to metal catalysts, such as Ni, Ni/Cu and Fe-based catalysts due to their high activity, operation at moderate temperatures and the possibility of obtaining carbon nanotubes or filaments as co-product [4–13]. Nevertheless, metal catalysts exhibit some drawbacks such as a limited thermal and chemical tolerance, as well as a prompt deactivation caused by the blocking of their active sites by carbon deposition. Thus, metal catalysts are usually very vulnerable to the presence of sulfur compounds, which would be the case of using methane from biogas. More recently, carbonaceous catalysts have been extensively explored [14]. Although these catalytic systems require higher temperatures than the metallic ones, the use of carbonaceous materials as catalysts offer important advantages: (a) higher thermal stability; (b) stronger resistance to sulfur and other chemical impurities, allowing the treatment of a large variety of methane feedstocks; (c) the catalyst regeneration may be not needed if the carbon produced in the process is or can be turned into catalytically active, and (d) the carbon product may have additional commercial applications due to its high purity and absence of metals. Using LCA tools, considering different energy scenarios, it has been concluded that autocatalytic decomposition of methane would represent a very promising and sustainable route for hydrogen production when compared with SMR [2]. Moreover, if biogas is employed as feed, the possibility of simultaneously achieving the production of energy (contained in the hydrogen) with a net carbon fixation has been reported [15]. A wide variety of carbonaceous materials, obtained from different sources and methods, have been investigated as catalysts for hydrogen production via methane decomposition [16–36]. From these studies a general relationship between the catalytic activity of carbons and their structural and surface properties can be deduced. Thus, amorphous carbons, such as carbon blacks or activated carbons, are more active than crystalline phases such as graphite, due to a higher concentration of defects on the formers, which have been proposed as the main active sites of the reaction [36]. Concerning the textural properties, those carbons having higher external surface area or mesoporosity deactivate much more slowly because they offer a higher accessibility to methane molecules, even after the formation of large quantities of carbon deposits. In this way, we demonstrated the exceptional catalytic behavior in the DeCH4 reaction of mesostructured carbons as catalysts, in particular of CMK-3 and CMK-5 ordered mesoporous carbons [33–36], characterized by having high surface areas and pore structures with hexagonal pore symmetry (p6mm) [37]. When compared with some representative commercial carbons, CMK materials exhibited very high activities, the best results being obtained over CMK-5. This material, characterized by possessing surface areas close to 2000 m2/g and a bimodal mesopore system, led to the highest hydrogen production and strongest resistance to deactivation under the reaction conditions employed. In the present work, the DeCH4 kinetics at short and long reaction times is investigated to estimate different kinetics parameters, such as the reaction order and activation energy over the aforementioned CMK carbons. For this purpose, different temperatures and CH4 partial pressures have been employed. The results have been compared with those obtained over two commercial carbon blacks. In all cases, particular attention has been paid to the possible presence of autocatalytic effects, as this would enhance strongly the large-scale feasibility of the process."
1,Experimental,
2,Carbonaceous catalysts,"2.1 Carbonaceous catalysts The mesostructured carbons, CMK-3 and CMK-5, were synthesized according to a procedure published elsewhere [37], based on a nanocasting pathway using pure silica SBA-15 as hard template. SBA-15 was prepared by a soft-templating route, employing tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and a non-ionic triblock copolymer (Pluronic 123) as silica source and mesopore liquid template, respectively. After calcination, the SBA-15 material was infiltrated with the carbon precursor solution, which was subsequently polymerized and carbonized by calcination under inert atmosphere. Furfuryl alcohol (FA) was used as carbon precursor, oxalic acid as polymerization catalyst and trimethylbenzene (TMB) as solvent. Once the silica template was removed by treatment with a basic solution (NaOH), the mesostructured carbons were attained. Two types of CMK materials were prepared by infiltrating pure FA (CMK-3) or a solution containing 60% FA in TMB (CMK-5), respectively. Details of the preparation procedure followed can be found in previous works [36,37]. Additionally, two commercial carbon blacks (black pearls 2000 and vulcan XC72, both from Cabot Corp.) were employed as reference catalysts."
3,CH4 decomposition experiments,"2.2 CH4 decomposition experiments Methane decomposition reactions were performed on a simultaneous DSC-TGA thermobalance (TGA-DSC1, Mettler Toledo). As the methane decomposition takes place, carbon deposits are formed onto the catalyst allowing the reaction to be monitored through the measurement of the weight increase. Experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure, using a flow rate of 160 ml/min of 10–40% CH4 in Ar as reactive gas. The sample holder was a ceramic crucible with a volume of 150 μl. Due to the different densities of the samples, the weights introduced were varied in order to operate in all cases with a catalyst volumetric loading close to 40 μl. Reactions were operated under isothermal conditions at different temperatures (890, 940, 965 and 990 °C). Previously to the reaction experiment, the catalysts were dried at 250 °C under nitrogen flow. A blank reaction at 990 °C during 24 h with empty pans was performed verifying that the contribution of thermal decomposition of methane to the measured weight increase was negligible."
4,Results and discussion,"An exhaustive characterization of the structural, textural and chemical properties of the carbonaceous catalysts tested in this work has been reported in previous publications [35,36]. However, a brief description of the main properties is given as follows. Table 1 reports the BET surface area (S BET), total pore volume (V PORE) and micropore volume (S MIC) of the samples, as well as the contribution of the meso and/or external surface area (S ExT-MESO) calculated by subtracting the micropore surface (S MIC) to S BET. Except for the carbon black CB-v, the rest of carbons present very high surface areas, above 1000 m2/g, with the highest value corresponding to CMK-5. Moreover, the total pore volume (estimated at P/P 0 = 0.98) of this last carbon exceeds 2 cm3/g. Both CMK-3 and CMK-5 are purely mesoporous materials, as no microporosity and little contribution of the external surface area are detected on these materials. On the other hand, the CB samples are formed by aggregation of nanoparticles (around 20 nm). In CB-bp these nanoparticles are microporous, hence a great part of its BET surface area is in the form of micropore surface area, although the contribution of the external surface of the nanoparticles is also quite relevant. In contrast CB-v is formed by larger nanoparticles (around 50 nm), with little microporosity, so in this case most of its surface area corresponds with the outer part of the nanoparticles. From the structural point of view, the commercial samples present disordered porous systems while both CMKs exhibit a high mesoscopic order, with a p6mm hexagonal pore symmetry, which is in agreement with their preparation procedure by nanoreplication of the SBA-15 structure. In the case of CMK-5, owing to the partial filling of the template pores with the carbon precursor, it presents a bimodal porosity, with pore diameters of 3 and 5.8 nm, respectively. In contrast, CMK-3 has a unique pore system with a mean pore size of 3 nm, as it is prepared by filling completely the SBA-15 pores with the carbon precursor."
5,Effect of temperature and time on the catalytic DeCH4 reaction,"3.1 Effect of temperature and time on the catalytic DeCH4 reaction Carbonaceous materials are active catalysts in hydrogen production by methane decomposition when working at high temperature. Accordingly, and based on previous results obtained under temperature programmed conditions, the catalytic properties of the materials here investigated have been checked in the temperature range 890–990 °C [35,36]. At lower temperatures the activity is very small, whereas for temperatures over 1000 °C the thermal non-catalytic methane decomposition starts being significant. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 1 in the form of carbon deposition, expressed relative to the initial dried catalyst weight, along the time for the different reaction temperatures and carbon catalysts. In all cases, and as it was expected, the amount of carbon deposited over each catalyst increases with the temperature. Most curves show a sharp transition from an initial period with high carbon deposition rates to a second one in which the methane decomposition proceeds more slowly. Although these findings will be discussed in detail later when analyzing the kinetic curves, they evidence the presence of strong deactivation effects with most catalysts. The catalytic behavior exhibited by both commercial carbons tested was different. In the case of the CB-bp sample, a significant initial activity is observed, but after some time the carbon production curves are leveled-off, suggesting that this material suffers of extensive deactivation. On the contrary, CB-v remains quite active along the whole range of reaction times and temperatures. These results seem to be in contrast with previous studies, in which CB-bp led to larger carbon yields than CB-v [16,20,26,29]. Nevertheless, it must be taken into account that those works were carried out at temperatures in the range 850–900 °C and during shorter times. Upon similar conditions, it can be observed in Fig. 1 that a higher activity is also obtained in the present work for CB-bp compared to CB-v, but as the reaction time is increased the former is deactivated more quickly. Regarding the two mesostructured carbon catalysts, after a sharp transition on the initial stages of the reaction, a sustained carbon production is observed in both cases, which remains even at long reaction times, indicating that these materials are quite resistant to deactivation. A higher carbon production is obtained with CMK-5 compared to CMK-3 in all the investigated temperatures. This is in agreement with previous results, being assigned to the presence of superior textural properties in CMK-5: higher surface area, larger pore volume and bimodal mesopore system. This high activity results in the production of significant amount of carbon that, for the highest temperature here tested, reaches values of 7 and 14 g of deposited carbon per gram of CMK-3 and CMK-5, respectively, at the end of the experiments. Additional experiments, using longer reaction times, have been performed with the three catalysts showing the highest activity (CB-v, CMK-3 and CMK-5). As seen in Fig. 2 , after 48 h of reaction at 990 °C, the three carbon materials still retain a remarkable activity despite having accumulated high amounts of deposited carbon. Among them, CMK-5 is clearly the best catalyst, affording the formation of up to 24 g of carbon per gram of catalyst after 48 h of reaction, which indicates that this material shows a right combination of exceptional stability and clearly superior methane decomposition activity."
6,Carbon deposition rates,"3.2 Carbon deposition rates The carbon deposition rates have been calculated as derivatives of the curves of Fig. 1. The results so obtained are further represented and analyzed for each catalyst in terms of their evolution along the reaction time and as a function of the amount of carbon deposits being formed (C dep/C 0). Fig. 3 shows the carbon deposition rates corresponding to the commercial carbon black pearls (CB-bp). It can be observed that the initial catalyst weight increase suffers a rapid fall reaching a minimum value from which the reaction rate increases. After a maximum is attained, the activity decreases again and converges to a much lower reaction rate. This behavior can be appreciated even more clearly when the reaction rate is plotted versus the relative weight of carbon deposits formed. Pinilla et al. [24] reported similar results using CB-bp as catalyst. In order to explain these trends, three different zones can be distinguished in the reaction rate curves: • Zone (1). It corresponds with the first activity drop, which has been attempted to be related in an earlier work to a progressive removal of the surface oxygenated groups [24], as they are considered to contribute to the initial catalytic activity over carbonaceous catalysts. However, at the high reaction temperatures employed, most of the oxygenated groups should have been already removed during the heating process before the reaction begins. In a recent work [36], we have concluded that one of the most crucial factors governing the initial reaction stages over carbonaceous catalysts is the surface area and, mainly, the presence of defects in the surface graphene layers. Accordingly, the coverage of at least a part of these defects with the first carbon atoms formed from the methane decomposition would be the major reason of the initial drop in the reaction rate for this catalyst. • Zone (2). It is featured by an increase in the reaction rate. This apparently anomalous behavior denotes the presence of an autocatalytic effect. It means that the carbon deposits formed from methane decomposition possess also some degree of catalytic activity, making the carbon deposition rate to increase as a function of time. However, this growth does not follow an exponential trend, which indicates that the intrinsic activity of the new active sites is lower than that of the initial ones present in the raw catalyst and/or that the new sites are also subjected to deactivation. This zone ends when the reaction rate reaches a maximum value, indicating that from this point deactivation again becomes prevalent. The reaction rate corresponding to this maximum increases with the temperature, being shifted progressively toward shorter times. However, independently of the reaction temperature, it takes place always for the same C dep/C 0 ratio (about 2.2). Assuming that density of amorphous carbons are in the range 1.8–2.1 g/cm3, it can be estimated that the carbon deposits occupy a volume in the range 1.22–1.05 cm3 per gram of catalyst. These values are clearly superior to the micropore volume of CB-bp (0.48 cm3/g), showing that in this case the transition to a low activity zone occurs by deactivation not only of the active sites located inside the micropores. • Zone (3). It is again a zone in which the reaction rate decreases along the time, i.e. deactivation becomes predominant for a second time. This result indicates that not only the initial active sites, but also the ones present in the formed carbon, are subjected to deactivation, which reduces the accessibility of the methane molecules to the active centers. CB-bp is totally deactivated at the end of every reaction except for the highest temperature, where a small activity is still appreciated. At the highest temperature, the mobility of the carbon deposits may facilitate that a part of the active sites of the catalyst keeps some accessibility. Likewise, some small contribution of the thermal non-catalytic methane decomposition may occur when the temperature approaches 1000 °C. Fig. 4 illustrates the evolution of the carbon deposition rate as the reaction proceeds when carbon black CB-v is used as catalyst. Three zones, equivalent to those of CB-bp, may be distinguished also in this case, although the autocatalytic behavior is detected at shorter times in CB-v compared to CB-bp. It must be noted that the CB-v catalyst consists of nanoparticles with little microporosity, which implies that its activity is mainly generated by the active sites located on the external surface of the nanoparticles. The maximum in the carbon deposition rate, that marks the transition from zone 2 to zone 3, takes place for a C dep/C 0 of about 2. This value is slightly smaller than that obtained over the CB-bp sample and it seems no to be affected by the reaction temperature. It corresponds with a volume occupied by the carbon deposits in the range of 1.11–0.95 cm3/g of catalyst, quite superior to the CB-v micropore volume (0.17 cm3/g). Accordingly, the transition from zone 2 to 3 is not related in this case to pore filling or blockage effects, but to deactivation of both the external active sites and the new ones responsible of the autocatalytic behavior. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that the activity drop corresponding to zone 3 over CB-v is not as sharp as for CB-bp, despite the former having a significantly smaller BET surface area. This finding implies that for the CB-v catalyst some degree of accessibility to the active sites is retained even at long reaction times. As a consequence, CB-v is capable of accumulating quite higher amounts of carbon deposits than CB-bp, while keeping still some activity at the end of the experiments at all the tested temperatures. In the case of the CMK catalysts, at first glance the reaction rate curves appear different to those corresponding to the commercial carbon black samples (Figs. 5 and 6 ). At short reaction times, the carbon deposition rate decreases continuously as the reaction proceeds, which denotes a progressive deactivation of the catalyst, but showing no maximum. This could suggest in principle that no autocatalytic effects are present with these catalysts. However, the shape of the curves indicates that the activity decline does not follow a simple trend but it is the overall result from the addition of several contributions. Accordingly, and a similar way to the case of carbon blacks, three activity zones may be assigned in the case of the CMKs catalysts: zone 1 with a fast activity reduction due to the deactivation of the initial sites; zone 2 showing the influence of an autocatalytic contribution that retards partially the decrease of the carbon deposition rate; and zone 3 in which a second fast activity drop takes place as deactivation becomes again predominant. Therefore, some kind of autocatalytic effect also occurs over the CMK catalysts, although it is not so clearly visible as with the CB samples because is largely masked by the fast activity drop in zone 1. At long times, the reaction rate reaches a quasi-stationary state, no further deactivation signals being discernible. In the graphs representing the relative carbon deposition rate as a function of C dep/C 0, it can be clearly observed that the transition to the quasi-stationary state occurs for the CMK catalysts when almost the same amount of carbon deposits have been formed, whatever the temperature is. These C dep/C 0 values are about 0.9 for CMK-3 and 1.4 for CMK-5, which would correspond with volumes of the carbon deposits (assuming the density of amorphous carbons indicated above) in the range of 0.5–0.43 and 0.78–0.67 cm3 per gram of catalyst, respectively. These data are clearly lower than the mesopore volume of the CMK materials, 1.08 and 2.37 cm3/g for CMK-3 and CMK-5, respectively. Therefore, in these catalysts the transition to zone 3 occurs before the mesopores are filled by the carbon deposits. As we have earlier proposed [35], in the earlier stages of the process, the amount and size of the carbon deposits formed within the catalyst mesopores are rather lower than the volume and diameter of the CMKs pores, hence the reaction rate is not influenced by the intraparticle diffusion. However, when the carbon deposits approach in size and volume those of the mesopores, the reaction rate becomes governed by diffusional phenomena, reaching the transition to zone 3. Nevertheless, at this point the porosity of the CMK catalysts is not completely blocked, but is still accessible to the methane molecules as demonstrated by the high long–term activity they exhibit. This final activity seems to be very small compared with the initial one but it is large enough for allowing the carbon deposition from methane decomposition to proceed in a noticeable way. In fact, most of the weight increases appreciated in the curves of Figs. 1 and 2 for CMKs catalysts take place after the transition point, i.e. as a consequence of the reaction rate corresponding to zone 3."
7,Modeling of the autocatalytic phenomena and deactivation rates,"3.3 Modeling of the autocatalytic phenomena and deactivation rates The results obtained and commented in Section 3.2 denote the complexity of the system here studied in terms of its evolution along the time, which is also reflected in the shape of the carbon production rate curves, showing very different zones. This can be interpreted as a consequence of the overlapping of very different phenomena: deactivation of the initial active sites, autocatalytic behavior of the formed carbon deposits and deactivation of the new active sites. Moreover, at least in the case of the carbon catalysts having a strong contribution of micro- and mesoporosity, the possible presence of steric and diffusional limitation effects may influence both the methane decomposition reaction kinetics and the different deactivation phenomena. This complexity is clearly evidenced when the different roles played by the carbon materials are taken into account: raw catalyst, product of the main reaction, secondary catalyst and deactivating agent. In spite of this complexity, a relatively simple kinetic model has been here developed and successfully applied for describing the experimental curves, based on the occurrence of the above-mentioned phenomena. Thereby, the catalyst activity has been defined and calculated from the initial reaction rates (reaction rates at zero time), taking into account the usual definition of activity: (1) a ( t ) = r ( t ) r 0 It is generally agreed that the deactivation rate can be expressed through a power law expression of the activity, multiplied by the deactivation function, being dependent on both the composition and the temperature: (2) a ( t ) = φ ( P i , T ) · a d For an isothermal system with almost constant concentration of the reactant, as in our case, the deactivation function would be also constant. Accordingly, the deactivation rate can be expressed as a simple power law function: (3) − ⅆ a ⅆ t = k d · a d where k d represents the deactivation kinetic constant and d the deactivation order. Depending on the value of d (usually taken as 0, 1 or 2), the integration of this equation leads to different mathematical functions of the activity versus time. In the system here studied, both deactivation and autocatalytic effects occur simultaneously, so this must be taken into account for obtaining the corresponding deactivation rate equations. Thus, the following expression, which includes three different functions, is proposed: (4) a ( t ) = f d 1 ( t ) + f ac ( t ) · f d 2 ( t ) In this equation, f d1(t) represents the deactivation of the initial carbon catalyst, f ac(t) the autocatalytic contribution to the reaction rate and, therefore to the activity, and f d2(t) takes into account the deactivation of the new formed active sites. The last two functions are considered together as the involved effects are due to the same cause: the formation of carbonaceous deposits inducing both autocatalytic behavior and deactivating effects. For functions f d1(t) and f d2(t) different equations have been tested in this work, corresponding to the integration of Eq. (3) assuming different values of the deactivation order. Likewise, for the function including the autocatalytic effect, a power law has been considered since the autocatalytic reaction rate should follow a power law of the carbon being deposited, whereas the latter shows also a power law dependency along the reaction time in the range being considered in this study. Accordingly, equation f ac (t) can be expressed as a power law function of the time: (5) ⅆ a ⅆ t = k ac · a n a c → a = f ( t ) A non-linear multiple regression method has been used for the fitting of the experimental curves to the different models generated from Eq. (4). Table 2 summarizes the forms of the functions f d1(t) and f d2(t) that leads to the best fitting with each carbon catalyst. In all cases, it was necessary to include the three functions of Eq. (4) to get a good fitting of the experimental reaction rate curves. The results so obtained for a reaction temperature of 965 °C are illustrated in Fig. 7 , showing the experimental data, the overall fitting curve, as well as the contribution of the two terms included in Eq. (4). A quite good fitting has been obtained in all cases, in spite of the relative complexity of the experimental curves. Moreover, the values of the model parameters are always significant, being estimated with acceptable statistical errors. These facts are a clear indication of the validity of Eq. (4), and of the assumptions considered in the model, for describing this reaction system. For all the catalysts, the autocatalytic contribution is clearly visible, overlapping with the deactivation events. Interestingly, some differences can be observed between the type of carbon catalysts and the deactivation order that fits best the experimental results. In the case of the carbon black materials the first deactivation event follows a second deactivation order, whereas for the CMKs samples the deactivation in the first step is more adequately described by a first order deactivation equation. This finding is reasonable as the first activity decay represents the deactivation of the active centers, mainly defect sites in the carbon structure, in the raw carbon catalysts. This is a logical result as the nature of the active sites in the two carbon blacks samples are similar, but different from those present in CMKs. However, when comparing the four carbon catalysts in terms of the second deactivation event, the CB-bp behaves closer to the CMK carbons exhibiting a zero deactivation order, in contrast with the first order found for the CB-v sample. Taking into account that the three former carbons are highly porous materials, it can be proposed that the second deactivation event in this case is strongly linked to the presence of steric and diffusional limitations for the growth of the carbon deposits inside the limited intraparticle porosity. However, this effect is not so determinant in the case of the CB-v carbon as it is a material with quite lower porosity. In this case, the carbon formed from methane decomposition is formed mainly over the external surface of the catalyst nanoparticles, where steric and diffusional limitations are absent, explaining why in this case the autocatalytic behavior is observed for an extended period of time compared to the other catalysts."
8,Reaction rate and activation energy at the different reaction stages,"3.4 Reaction rate and activation energy at the different reaction stages Average values of the carbon deposition rates have been calculated, for each catalyst and temperature, at both the beginning and the end of the whole reaction period. The initial reaction rates (r 0) were calculated from the earliest activity data of zone 1, being shown in Table 3 . As it was expected, the values of r 0 increase with the reaction temperature. The order of the initial carbon deposition rate was, for all the temperatures tested, as follows: CMK-5 > CMK-3 > CB-bp > CB-v. The activation energies (E a) of the process corresponding to all the carbon catalysts were calculated by fitting the experimental data to the Arrhenius plot, assuming that a direct proportionality exists between the kinetic constant and the initial reaction rate. Fig. 8 shows the resultant fittings using the initial reaction rates previously estimated, whereas the calculated activation energies are summarized in Table 3. The E a values obtained for the carbon blacks are quite in agreement with those determined by other authors [18]. On the other hand, both CMK catalysts present lower activation energies: 178.1 ± 1.0 kJ/mol for CMK-3 and 205.9 ± 0.6 kJ/mol for CMK-5. It is interesting to note that these E a values are in between of those reported for activated carbons and carbon blacks [18]. Carbon deposition rates measured at the end of the reaction experiments and designated as r f are represented in Fig. 9 for each catalyst as a function of the temperature. The carbon deposition rate over CB-bp is very small, while the rest of carbons retain a significant activity. For most catalysts the reaction rate in zone 3 increases with the temperature, as it was expected. However, an anomalous behavior is observed with the CB-v sample, since in this case the reaction rate is practically constant in the range of temperatures investigated. Although the origin of this finding cannot be completely understood and explained yet, it can be considered as a consequence of the complexity of this reaction system: some active sites within the micropores of the catalyst, but mainly over its external surface area (CB-v is formed by nanoparticle aggregates), presence of an autocatalytic behavior and strong deactivation phenomena of both initial and new active sites. On the other hand, the results shown in Fig. 9 confirm that CMK-5 exhibits the highest methane decomposition rate in zone 3, being at 990 °C about three times higher than that obtained with the most active carbon black tested (CB-v). Although the reaction rate in zone 3 is quite lower compared with the initial carbon deposition rate, the value obtained for CMK-5 is still relevant, with almost 0.5 g of carbon being deposited per gram of catalyst in 1 h. This fact explains the high amounts of carbon that are deposited from methane decomposition over the CMK-5 catalyst along zone 3 (after the transition point), as it can be observed in both Figs. 1 and 2. The activation energies from the reaction rates in zone 3 have been determined for the CMK-3 and CMK-5 catalysts by fitting to the Arrhenius equation, the resultant values being 247.8 ± 0.6 and 244.8 ± 1.0 kJ/mol, respectively. Muradov et al. [20] have proposed that methane decomposition reaction takes place through two processes: carbon nuclei formation and carbon growth. The activation energies of carbon nucleation and carbon crystallite growth during thermal decomposition of methane are 316.8 and 227.1 kJ/mol, respectively. The activation energies obtained in zone 3 for both CMK carbons suggest that crystallite growth is the controlling step. Moreover, we presume that the majority of carbon deposits formed during the reaction grow and accumulate on the outer part of the catalyst particles, allowing a fraction of the original active sites remaining accessible to reactive methane molecules. This theory can be confirmed with the TEM images of the CMK-5 catalyst before and after reaction illustrated in Fig. 10 . The fresh catalyst exhibits the typical high mesoscopic order with cylindrical pores hexagonally arranged, since it is the inverse replica of the SBA-15 matrix. After reaction, despite a significant amount of carbon has been deposited, the mesoscopic structure may be still observed denoting it is not totally blocked. A large amount of carbon protrusions may be clearly observed on the outer part of the CMK-5 particles, having different shapes and structures. Thus, round and curved graphene layers are usually associated with the first stages of the reaction, whereas conical protrusions appear when significant amounts or carbon are generated [23]. Accordingly, it is deduced that initially the CMK-5 pores are partially filled with carbon and, when the pore volume is reduced up to a certain extent and difussional restrictions appear, the carbon deposits start growing toward outside the catalyst leading to the formation of the conical protuberances."
9,Effect of the CH4 partial pressure: determination of the reaction order,"3.5 Effect of the CH4 partial pressure: determination of the reaction order A number of experiments have been performed at constant temperature (965 °C) with each catalyst varying the methane partial pressure in the feed gas. The main objectives of these tests have been to determine the reaction order and to establish how the methane concentration affects the carbon deposition. Fig. 11 represents the evolution along the time of the deposited carbon relative to the initial catalyst weight (C dep/C 0) corresponding to these experiments. Although in general the increase of the methane concentration leads to higher and faster carbon deposition, quite different behaviors can be observed depending on the catalyst. CB-bp exhibits an increasing carbon deposition as the methane concentration is augmented until the transition on the activity curve is reached. From this point, there are almost not differences on the C dep/C 0 ratio, showing just a small increase with the methane content. As most of the surface area in this material is located in micropores, these results evidence again that the major factor determining the amount of carbon formed is the volume available in its microporosity. Once the latter is filled and blocked by the carbon from the reaction, the CB-bp activity becomes almost negligible, independently on the methane concentration in the feed. This material presents, in addition to micropores, a significant external surface area that should be less affected by deactivation. However, the results here obtained by varying both the temperature and the methane concentration indicate that this is not the case. Probably, the extensive coke formation occurring inside the micropores also causes a deactivation of the external sites when the carbon deposits come out and accumulate over the micropore entrances. A more conventional behavior is observed over the CB-v catalyst. In this case, the amount of carbon deposited increases with methane concentration in the whole range of reaction times investigated. This result confirms that with this material the activity for methane decomposition is largely originated by active sites located on the external surface of the catalyst nanoparticles, which are therefore free of pore volume limitations for the formation and growth of the carbon deposits. In the case of CMK samples, the value of C dep/C 0 at which the sharp transition on the activity curves takes place is independent of the methane partial pressure. This fact confirms that the carbon deposited at the transition point is related to the pore volume of the catalysts. However, beyond the transition point, the carbon deposition is influenced by the reactive gas concentration showing a clearly increase with the methane partial pressure. It means that in this last zone pore limitations are less important. This apparently contradictory finding can be explained assuming that in the CMK catalyst the carbon formed during the reaction does not remain inside the pores, but it has the ability of moving and growing toward the exterior of the mesopores. This assumption is supported by TEM images (Fig. 10), showing carbon structures leaving from the CMKs mesopores, which is possible due to the relatively large size of the latter. Moreover, this would be the key factor that explains the sustained activity showed by CMKs at long reaction times, as well as the high amount of carbon deposited over these catalysts while keeping a significant activity. Likewise, the presence of a double mesopore system in CMK-5 would reinforce these effects, being responsible for its higher long–term activity compared to CMK-3. On the other hand, the results obtained using different methane partial pressures in the feed have been employed for the calculation of the methane decomposition reaction order over the different catalysts. Thereby, the values of the initial reaction rates were fitted according to a power law kinetic model r 0 = k P CH 4 n , where k is the reaction rate constant and P CH 4 the partial pressure of methane. The plot of Ln(r 0) versus Ln P CH 4 provides the reaction order (n) as the slope of the linear regression fit. As it can be observed in Table 4 , for all the carbon catalysts “n” was close 0.5 with coefficients of determination higher than 0.99, except for CB-v. The value obtained is in agreement with that determined by other authors using carbonaceous materials as catalysts in the DeCH4 reaction [20,24]. A half-order reaction indicates that the methane decomposition proceeds through a dissociative mechanism where the reactant adsorbs onto two surface active sites, which is typically observed over heterogeneous catalysts [24]."
10,Conclusions,"Based on the above described observations and findings, a general mechanism is here proposed for the methane decomposition reaction over carbonaceous catalysts comprising the following events: • The reaction is initiated over defects present in the graphene layers of the carbonaceous catalysts, which have been identified as the main active sites of methane decomposition. It takes place by a dissociative mechanism in which one molecule of methane is adsorbed on two active sites, being subsequently dissociated to yield hydrogen and carbon, which remains deposited over the catalyst. This mechanism is in agreement with the observed half-order kinetics. • Depending on the textural properties of the catalyst, the active sites may be located inside the micropores, mesopores or over the external surface of nanoparticles. A combination of these different locations occurs simultaneously in several of the catalysts: CB-bp and CB-v (micropore and external surfaces). In contrast, CMK materials show just mesopore surface area with monomodal (CMK-3) and bimodal (CMK-5) mesopore size distributions. • All carbonaceous catalysts undergo a very rapid initial deactivation, which is denoted by a sharp decline in the reaction rate along the first hour of reaction. This activity decrease occurs really fast for all the catalysts, being noticeable even when very small amounts of carbon have been deposited from methane decomposition. This result indicates that the initial deactivation proceeds by site coverage or simply because a great part of the defects sites disappear as the vacancies in the graphene layers are covered with the first carbon atoms formed from methane dissociation. • The initial deactivation is followed by a period exhibiting autocatalytic effects. In the case of the carbon black catalysts, this period is clearly detected as an increase in the carbon deposition rate along the reaction time. This finding means that the carbon deposits formed from methane decomposition contain also active sites, i.e. defects that may catalyze the reaction. However, the autocatalytic behavior is not sustained for long times as a transition to a second fast deactivation zone takes place, showing that the new formed active sites, present in the formed carbon deposits, suffer also a significant deactivation. • The position of the transition point, in terms of the amount of deposited carbon referred to the initial catalyst weight, is little affected by the reaction temperature and the methane concentration in the feed, although it varies largely from one catalyst to other. Therefore, the transition point seems to be very dependent on the physicochemical and textural properties of the carbonaceous catalyst. In the sample having a high contribution of micropores to the surface area (CB-bp), the transition appears to be associated to pore blockage. In the case of the pure mesoporous catalysts (CMK-3 and CMK-5) the transition occurs when the mesopores are partially filled with carbon deposits, which may cause important steric and diffusional hindrances for the growth of the carbon deposits inside the mesopores. Finally, for the catalyst having mainly external active sites (CB-v) the transition is observed at high carbon depositions, since in this case no steric limitations are present for the growth of the carbon deposits over the outer surface of the catalyst nanoparticles. • At long reaction times, a quasi-stationary zone is observed in which the reaction rate does not change significantly along the time. For CB-bp this final reaction rate is quite small, owing to the extensive deactivation they have undergone by pore filling and blockage. However, CB-v, CMK-3 and CMK-5 keep a noticeable value of the final reaction rate, which implies that the carbon deposition continues in this last stage. Especially remarkable is the behavior of CMK-5 as it retains an almost constant, and still significant, catalytic activity in this zone in spite of the high amounts of carbon deposits that are formed. Thus, up to 24 g of carbon per gram of CMK-5 catalyst have been measured in this work after 48 h. This finding suggests that a part of the initial active sites in CMK-5 remains accessible to methane owing to the ability of the carbon deposits for moving and growing toward the exterior of the mesopores. This assumption is supported by TEM images, showing carbon structures leaving from the CMKs mesopores, which is possible due to the relatively large size of the latter. Otherwise, the sustained activity of CMK-5, as well as of CMK-3 and CB-v, at long reaction times may be also due to the existence of the autocatalytic effect, so the carbon deposits being generated exhibit some catalytic activity, although just temporary, as they are covered and, therefore, blocked by the formation of additional carbon. • The validity of this mechanism has been probed by developing a relatively simple kinetic model that takes into account the above commented events. A reasonable fitting has been achieved with this model for the experimental carbon production rates in spite of the complexity of these curves in some cases. The kinetic model takes into account the existence of autocatalytic effects and the existence of two different deactivation phenomena."
