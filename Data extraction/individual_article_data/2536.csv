0,Introduction,"Synthetic dyes have been used extensively in most of the industries such as textile, paper and pulp, tannery and pharmaceutical owing to their low production cost, vivid colours, resistance towards environmental factors and easy-to apply factor [1]. The extensive use of these dyes has resulted to an enormous amount of pollutants being discharged into water systems causing detrimental effects on the environment as well as jeopardising human health [2]. Therefore, the dye effluent must be treated efficiently before releasing into the water body. Various approaches have been developed to eliminate dyes from industrial wastewater which include coagulation [3], electrocoagulation [4], cation-exchange membrane [5], photocatalysis [6], and adsorption [7]. Among these treatment methods, adsorption has been recognized as a more favourable method owing to its simplicity, greater removal efficiency as well as almost zero secondary pollution [8]. Generally, the utilization of natural and renewable materials as feasible adsorbents in the adsorption process has gained great attention [9]. Chitosan (Cs) is a natural polysaccharide derived from chitin extracted from crustacean shells [10]. Cs, which possesses unique remarkable properties such as nontoxic substances, biodegradability, economical, and biocompatibility has aroused the attention of many researchers for utilizing Cs in various potential applications including biomedicine [11], food [12], cosmetic [13], and wastewater treatment [14]. The abundance of amino and hydroxyl functional groups in the molecular structure of Cs makes it as an excellent biosorbent for the treatment of wastewater [15]. Nevertheless, the application of unmodified Cs is limited due to its sensitivity to pH, low mechanical properties, high swelling index and low surface area [16]. Thus, some physical and chemical modifications are required for enhancing Cs's chemical stability, surface area improvement, and adsorptive efficiency. Crosslinking is a chemical modification pathway that stabilizes the chemical strength of Cs at acidic pH conditions, and also helps to improve the mechanical strength of Cs [17]. Modification of Cs can be done by involving the abundant amino and hydroxyl functional groups of Cs with certain functional groups of the crosslinking agent at specific conditions [18]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a synthetic water-soluble nontoxic polymer that possesses outstanding characteristics including high hydrophilicity, excellent mechanical properties, biocompatibility and biodegradability [19]. From green chemistry concept, using a water-based crosslinking agent such as PVA to form a chemically stable Cs-PVA blend will offer many desirable characteristics like better mechanical strength, chemical stability, and polymer functionality which attributes to the hydrogen bonding between PVA and the amine group of the Cs [20,21]. Recently, solid waste disposal is one of the most concerning environmental issues. Coal fly ash (FA) is a side product produced during coal combustion in thermal power plants and is mainly composed of unburned carbons, iron oxides and aluminosilicates [22]. FA is regarded as solid industrial waste which is usually disposed in large amounts in landfills [23]. Thus, environmentalists and scientists have put a great effort in scrutinizing all other potential utilizations for proper disposal, management and utilization [24]. Nowadays, there is growing concern about utilizing FA in the wastewater treatment applications, since it benefits both the economy and environment [23]. The many desirable properties of FA such as preferable particle size, large specific area with porous structure, richness in various metals oxide elements make it a promising adsorbent [25]. However, FA as ultra-fine particles needs a complicated filtration procedure to recover during and post adsorption process [26]. In recent years, magnetic separation technology has been introduced as a perfect solution to overcome the adsorbent's powder recovery by applying an external magnet or magnetic field as a quick and convenient separation method [27,28]. Formation of magnetic composite Cs-based advanced materials has gained considerable interests recently due to its outstanding characteristics such as convenient operation, magnetic response ability, and reusability [29–31]. In this respect, magnetic Cs composites have been successfully applied as promising recoverable adsorbents for removal of dyes [31], heavy metal ions [32], and pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions [33]. The above-mentioned potential application and approaches inspire us to develop chemically stable, recoverable, and enhanced adsorbent with preferable adsorption capacity towards textile anionic dye models. To achieve this goal, a magnetic blend of Cs-PVA was upgraded by loading microparticles of FA into its molecular structure for enhancing its adsorptive property. The final product of magnetic chitosan-polyvinyl alcohol/fly ash (m-Cs-PVA/FA) biocomposite was applied as potential and recoverable adsorbent to eliminate Reactive Orange 16 dye (RO16) from the water bodies. A statistical optimization to the solo and collective adsorption key variables such m-Cs-PVA/FA dose, temperature, contact time, and solution pH was made by using Box-Behnken Design (BBD) in response surface methodology (RSM)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chitosan (Cs) (deacytelation ≥75%; medium molecular weight) and PVA (MW = 60,000, degree of hydrolysis ≥98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. ACROS, Organics provided the Reactive Orange 16 dye (C20H17N3Na2O11S3) with a molecular weight of 617.54 g/mol. Iron (III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3.6H2O, MW: 270.30 g/mol) and Iron (II) chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2.4H2O, MW: 198.81 g/mol) were supplied by HmbG Chemicals. A thermal power plant located in Kapar, Klang, Selangor, Malaysia provided the coal Fly ash (FA) powder."
3,Synthesis of m-Cs-PVA/FA,"2.2 Synthesis of m-Cs-PVA/FA First, the received FA was thoroughly washed with distilled water before being dried inside an oven overnight at 100 °C. The specific particle size of FA was identified using particle size analysis, and the FA particle size in general falls in microscale range (0.5 μm–120 μm), and the major particle size of FA is specifically between 40 μm–60 μm as shown in Fig. 1 . The preparation method of the m-Cs-PVA/FA was adopted from the published method elsewhere with slight modifications [34]. In this method, the steps to synthesize m-Cs-PVA/FA started with mixing of 1 g Cs flakes and 1 g FA microparticles in 5% acetic acid solution (50 mL) and stirred magnetically for 24 h to acquire a viscous homogenized solution of Cs/FA. The amount of 2.7 g FeCl2.4H2O and 3.9 g FeCl3.6H2O which were mixed in 10 mL distilled water were transferred to the Cs/FA solution and allowed to stir magnetically for 1 h. The obtained solution was converted into hydrogel beads using a 10 mL syringe needle and neutralized by using 2 M NaOH aqueous solution under mild stirring for 6 h. An extensive washing process was made using distilled water on fresh magnetic (m-Cs/FA) beads to reach a neutral pH. The crosslinking step was performed by first preparing the 5% PVA solution. 5 g of PVA powder was added into 100 mL of distilled water and refluxed at 70 °C for 5 h. Then, the freshly prepared 5% PVA was added into wet magnetic Cs/FA beads and stirred in water bath for 2 h at 70 °C. Again, the produced magnetic (m-Cs-PVA/FA) beads were rinsed with distilled water before being dried at room temperature. The preparation steps of the m-Cs-PVA/FA beads are summarized in the Fig. 2 . Lastly, the m-Cs-PVA/FA beads were converted into powder form with a constant particle size of ≤250 μm and the powder was kept in an airtight container for further use in RO16 removal applications."
4,Characterization of m-Cs-PVA/FA,"2.3 Characterization of m-Cs-PVA/FA Various analytical methods and techniques were performed to characterize m-Cs-PVA/FA. The particle size of FA was determined using Bettersizer 2600 (Wet) particle size analysis. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption measured by Micromeritics ASAP 2060 Analyzer was used to determine the surface area and pore volume of the m-Cs-PVA/FA. The morphologic features for m-Cs-PVA/FA before and after adsorption of RO16 dye were observed using scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM-EDX, Hitachi TM3030Plus). The crystal phase of m-Cs-PVA/FA was investigated using X-ray diffractometer (XRD, X'Pert PRO, PANalytical) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). The magnetic property of m-Cs-PVA/FA was studied using vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, Lakeshore/7404). The estimation of amino (NH2) content in m-Cs-PVA/FA was made using the pH-potentiometric titration method as described by Vieira and Beppu [35]. The reported method by Dalvand et al. [36] was used to calculate the point of zero charge (pHpzc) of the m-Cs-PVA/FA. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra of m-Cs-PVA/FA before and after removal of RO16 dye in the range of 4000–500 cm−1 were determined using FTIR spectroscopy (Perkin-Elmer, Spectrum RX1)."
5,Design of experiments,"2.4 Design of experiments In this present work, to assess the solo and collective effect of the operating adsorption factors on the removal of RO16 (%), Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was utilized. BBD is one of the response surface methodologies that give precise equations to express the interaction between the variables and responses [34]. The adsorbent dose (A), pH of the solution (B), temperature (C) and time (D) were selected as independent factors while RO16 removal (%) was considered as response of BBD. The ranges of each independent factor along with the levels are shown in Table 1 . Levels of the independent factors were chosen based on the preliminary studies. To assess the efficiency of m-Cs-PVA/FA towards removal of RO16, a total of 29 experiments were conducted which include 5 centre points runs to calculate the error. The correspondence between the factors and the response was estimated by applying a model of second-order polynomial equation as presented in the following Eq. (1). (1) Y = β 0 + ∑ β i Χ i + ∑ β ii Χ i 2 + ∑ ∑ β ij Χ i Χ j where, Y is the predicted response (RO16 removal (%)), β0 is offset term, βi is the linear effect of the input parameter, βii is the quadratic coefficient of the input parameter, and βij is the interaction coefficient between the input factors Χi and Χj. The design matrix performed based on the Box-Behnken technique and their corresponding responses for removal of RO16 dye are reported in Table 2 . The experiments for the adsorption were conducted by transferring 100 mL RO16 dye solution of 50 mg/L into a 250 mL conical flask. An amount of m-Cs-PVA/FA was weighed and transferred to the flasks. In water bath (WNB7 – 45, Memmert, Germany), these flasks were stirred at a constant stirring rate of 100 strokes/min. After the adsorption process is completed, m-Cs-PVA/FA was extracted by magnet and 0.45 μm syringe filter was used to filter the residual solution. Lastly, the concentration of RO16 dye at a wavelength of maximum absorbance (λmax) of 493 nm was recorded using spectrophotometer (HACH, DR 3900). The dye removal of RO16 dye (DR%) was computed by Eq. (2): (2) DR % = C ο − C e C ο × 100 where Cο (mg/L) is the initial concentration of RO16 dye and Ce (mg/L) is the equilibrium concentration of the RO16 dye."
6,Batch adsorption study,"2.5 Batch adsorption study In batch mode, the effect of initial RO16 concentration and contact time on the removal of RO16 by m-Cs-PVA/FA was investigated. The optimal key adsorption parameters were obtained from run (experiment)13 in Table 2. These optimum adsorption key parameters (adsorbent dose = 0.06 g, solution pH = 4, and working temperature = 30 °C) were kept constant in the experiments of batch adsorption study. The optimum key parameters were implemented in a conical flask (250 mL) containing 100 mL RO16 dye of different series of initial concentrations (20–200 mg/L). The mixture was filtered at the end of the predetermined time intervals and the adsorption capacity at equilibrium was determined using Eq. (3). (3) q e = C ο − C e V W where, q e(mg/g) is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium, W (g) is the mass of m-Cs-PVA/FA and V (L) is the volume of RO16 dye solution."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of m-Cs-PVA/FA,"3.1 Characterization of m-Cs-PVA/FA The magnetic property of the m-Cs-PVA/FA was identified using VSM as shown in Fig. 3 . As can be seen, a typical magnetization loop was observed, and there was no remanence and coercivity, indicating a superparamagnetic property of the m-Cs-PVA/FA was achieved [37]. The calculated saturation magnetization was found to be 20.05 emu/g. This value was slightly lower than that of magnetic chitosan nanoparticles 36 emu/g [38]. In the same regard, this lower saturation magnetization value of the m-Cs-PVA/FA compared to magnetic chitosan nanoparticles can be assigned to the incorporation of the non-magnetic FA microparticles into polymeric matrix of the m-Cs-PVA. However, the m-Cs-PVA/FA can still be simply separated from the treated dye solution by using an external magnet as can be seen in the inserted picture in Fig. 3. The surface area characteristics and pore size property indicate that m-Cs-PVA/FA has a surface area of 0.5643 m2/g, total pore volume 0.00138 cm3/g and mean pore diameter 9.92 nm based on the BET surface area analysis. It can be concluded that m-Cs-PVA/FA has a relatively low surface area. The pore diameters are between 2 and 50 nm, indicating the presence of mesopore in the bead's structure [39,40]. Moreover, the m-Cs-PVA/FA has 22.47% amino (NH2) group content based on the potentiometric titrations results. These available amino groups have the potential to serve as active sites for adsorption [41]. The XRD pattern of the m-Cs-PVA/FA is depicted in Fig. 4 . The amorphous hump at 2θ = 100 to 200 can be assigned to the amorphous Cs [42]. Furthermore, sharp peaks observed at 2θ = 37° and 62° can be assigned to the crystalline phase of FA [43], and Fe3O4 particles [44], respectively. Low intensity of the peaks can be attributed to the strong interaction of Cs with PVA which results in reduced crystallinity. The functional groups present in m-Cs-PVA/FA before and after adsorption of RO16 are identified using FTIR analysis and displayed in Fig. 5 . The FTIR spectrum of m-Cs-PVA/FA (Fig. 5a) exhibited broad peaks in the region 3500 cm−1–3750 cm−1 corresponding to the vibration of OH of both Cs and PVA [16,45–47], as well as the presence of Ca(OH)2 in fly ash [48]. Other peaks were observed at 1690 cm−1 (amide I stretching vibration), 1560 cm−1 (amide II stretching vibration), 1400 cm−1 (CH3 symmetrical angular deformation) [8], and 1070 cm−1 (stretching vibration of CO group). The intensity of the peak at 1560 cm−1 is low since hydrogen bonds are possibly formed in Cs, PVA and FA via NH2 as the frequency of the stretching vibration decreased by the hydrogen bonding [47]. Moreover, the peak at 2400 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of aliphatic –CH of PVA backbone and at 1080 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of CO of PVA [49]. The peak observed in 680 cm−1 is due to the stretching vibration of FeO which indicates the presence of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in the synthesized m-Cs-PVA/FA [31]. After RO16 dye adsorption (Fig. 5b), slight changes of some peaks (2400 cm−1, 1560 cm−1, 1070 cm−1) can be observed suggesting the involvement of the m-Cs-PVA/FA's functional groups in the removal of RO16 dye. Moreover, the aromatic rings (CC) of RO16 dye adsorbed on the surface of m-Cs-PVA/FA may be corresponded by the peak at 1400 cm−1. SEM-EDX analysis was conducted to examine the morphological properties and elemental compositions of m-Cs-PVA/FA before and after RO16 dye adsorption. Fig. 6a and b show the SEM images along with the EDX analysis for m-Cs-PVA/FA before and after adsorption of RO16, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 6a that the surface morphology appeared to be rough with visible cavities. The m-Cs-PVA/FA's surface roughness is a vital factor that affects the adsorption efficiency since it leads to high hydrophilicity [16]. Moreover, the roughness of the m-Cs-PVA/FA's surface can be contributed by the addition of PVA. In fact, PVA is a linear molecule which can form three-dimensional networks in the composite easily. Moreover, PVA has a specific degree of crystallinity which explains the uneven particles observed on the surface of the composite [50]. The spherical particles of different sizes as highlighted in red circles, embedded on m-Cs-PVA/FA's surface suggest that FA micro particles were successfully incorporated into Cs's molecular structure. Based on the EDX analysis, the main elements contained in the polymeric matrix of m-Cs-PVA/FA were carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, and zirconium. In line with the RO16 dye molecules adsorbed on the surface of the m-Cs-PVA/FA, the surface of m-Cs-PVA/FA after adsorption of RO16 (Fig. 6b) appeared to be more compact with fewer cavities. In addition, the presence of S element in the EDX analysis which belongs to RO16 dye, reaffirmed the RO16 dye's molecules being adsorbed on the m-Cs-PVA/FA's surface."
9,Statistical validation of BBD data,"3.2 Statistical validation of BBD data Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to verify the model's fitness and significance and the results are listed in Table 3 . The significance of the quadratic model for the response in this study was depending on the p-value and F-value. A model term would be described as significant if it has p-value not more than 0.05 and high F-value [51]. The F-value for RO16 removal (%) was 20.05 and the corresponding p-value was <0.0001 based on the ANOVA results, which implies the significance of the model used and the ability of the model to demonstrate a strong correlation between both the independent factors and response and the model's probability of noise was 0.01%. The significant terms of the model for RO16 removal (%) as listed in Table 3 were A, B, C, D, AB, AC, BD and B2. The second order equation for the polynomial model between the studied variables and the response on RO16 dye removal was thus acquired and represented in Eq. (4): RO 16 removal % = + 33.68 + 10.32 A − 18.19 B − 9.67 C + 5.21 D − 7.0 AB (4) − 6.88 AC − 7.70 BD + 15.64 B 2 Predicted response values are computed by the equation described above. A synergistic effect is represented by a positive sign of the coefficients in the regression model while the antagonistic effect on the response is implied by a negative sign [52]. From Eq. (4), the constant 33.68 was evidently not by any factor or correlation of factors, and there was a negative impact on the response in the linear terms B, C and interaction terms AB, AC and BD indicating that the removal of RO16 (%) decreased as these terms increased. Meanwhile, the terms A, D and B2 which are represented by the positive sign had a positive impact suggesting that as the magnitude of these terms increased, the removal of RO16 (%) increased as well. Another factor considered for survey and indicator of the reliability of the chosen polynomial model for the fitness of the data are coefficient of determination (R 2) and adjusted R 2. The value of R 2 and adjusted R 2 obtained were 0.95 and 0.91 accordingly, which is close to unity and promotes a significant correlation between the actual and predicted values. In addition, the value of R 2 is greater than the value of adjusted R 2 reflecting the good quality of the model [53]. The experimental data were also evaluated to verify the normality of the residuals. A dot diagram or a normal probability plot of these residuals is displayed in Fig. 7a. All the data points lying closely to the linear line indicate the significance of the chosen factors and the accuracy of the assumptions [54]. The correspondence between the actual and predicted data for RO16 dye removal (%) by Cs-PVA/FA/Fe3O4 is shown in Fig. 7b. The data from each run collected from the experiment is the actual value while the data measured from the model by employing the Design-Expert software (version 13, Stat-Ease, Minneapolis, USA) is the predicted value. As can be seen from the plot (Fig. 7b), a magnificent correspondence between the actual and predicted values was observed since most of the data points lean closely to the diagonal line. Furthermore, the lack of fit (LOF) p-value as reported in Table 3 was greater than 0.05 suggesting that the mathematical models is insignificant relative to the pure error, and this reflects a good response to the model. Besides, the LOF F-value of 5.57 indicates that there is a 5.62% likelihood that such a large F-value of LOF will occur due to noise. The LOF is desired to be insignificant as we required the model to fit [55]. A plot of residuals against run number is shown Fig. 7c. As can be observed from Fig. 7c, all the data are lying within the residual limits (±3), indicating that the model is valid [56]. Therefore, all these statistical analyses have shown that the quadratic models have proven to be effective in capturing the relationship between independent factors and the response. 3.2.1 Effect of solo adsorption key parameters The effect of solo adsorption key variables such as adsorbent dose (coded as A), solution pH (coded as B), working temperature (coded as C), and contact time (coded as D) are presented in Fig. 8a, b, c, and d, respectively. Fig. 8a shows that increasing the adsorbent dose from 0.02 g to 0.1 g generally will increase the RO16 removal (%). This is because more active sites for adsorption will be available by loading extra amounts of adsorbent into the dye solution. On the other hand, the RO16 removal (%) decreased by increasing the pH of the solution from 4 to 10 as shown in Fig. 8b. This observation can be explained due to the protonation of amine (NH3 +) in the surface charge of the m-Cs-PVA/FA at acidic solution environments, which leads to high affinity of the adsorbent towards capturing more anionic RO16 dye. Similar behaviour can be observed in Fig. 8c, which shows a gradual descent in the RO16 removal (%) as the working solution temperature is increased from 30 °C to 50 °C. This phenomenon implies that the RO16 removal process on the surface of m-Cs-PVA/FA is an exothermic in nature. Furthermore, by extending the contact time from 5 min to 30 min, the RO16 removal (%) increased rapidly as shown in Fig. 8d. By extending the contact time, the RO16 dye molecules will be given an adequate time to be loaded onto adsorbent (m-Cs-PVA/FA) surface as well as to penetrate the inner adsorption sites available in the internal molecular structure. 3.2.2 Synergistic effect of collective adsorption key parameters Design-Expert software (version 13, Stat-Ease, Minneapolis, USA) was utilized to construct the three-dimensional (3D) response surface plots by varying two factors within the range and holding another factor at certain level so that the correspondence between the response and the factors can be evaluated. The 3D response surface plots are displayed in Fig. 9 . The first significant interactive effect on the RO16 dye removal, with p-value of 0.0274 can be observed between adsorbent dose and solution pH as illustrated in Fig. 9a. This significant interaction demonstrates the essential role of solution pH and dose in removing RO16 dye by keeping other adsorption key parameters fixed at working temperature = 40 °C and contact time 17.5 min. As depicted in Fig. 9a, the removal of RO16 (%) increased from 17.4% to 90.3% by lowering the pH of the solution from 10 to 4, besides increasing the adsorbent dose from 0.02 g to 0.10 g. This can be best explained by the difference of the adsorbent surface charge in acidic and basic environment. To quantify the net surface charge, the point of zero charge (pHpzc) test was carried out and its corresponding results are presented in Fig. 9b. As depicted in Fig. 9b, the value of the pHpzc of the adsorbent (m-Cs-PVA/FA) is equal to 7, and the adsorbent surface will acquire a positive surface charge at solution pH ≤ 7 as proven by pHpzc (Fig. 9b). At solution pH lower than pHpzc, the removal of RO16 (%) by m-Cs-PVA/FA enhanced as more protons are present in the dye solution, which eventually leads to the protonation of amine (NH3 +) groups on the surface of m-Cs-PVA/FA. The protonation of amine (NH3 +) groups will increase the surface electro-positivity of m-Cs-PVA/FA towards RO16 dye, and leads to strong electrostatic attraction between negatively charged dye anions and positively charged adsorption sites [8]. On the other hand, at solution pH greater than pHpzc, the removal of RO16 (%) reduced significantly because of the electrostatic repulsion forces between the deprotonated surface of the m-Cs-PVA/FA (surface with negative charge at basic environment) with the anionic dye [34]. The same significant interaction revealed that as the adsorbent dose increases, RO16 removal (%) increases rapidly. In fact, adding more doses of the adsorbent to the acidic solution of RO16 dye will offer more active adsorption sites, presented by protonated amine (NH3 +) groups for capturing anionic dye molecules such as RO16 [8,15,34]. The second significant interactive effect on the RO16 dye removal with p-value of 0.0303, can be observed between adsorbent dose and working temperature as illustrated in Fig. 9c. This significant interaction shows the essential role of adsorbent dose and working temperature on the removal of RO16 by keeping other adsorption key variables fixed at solution pH = 7, and contact time 17.5 min. As can be seen, the RO16 removal (%) was gradually decreased as the working temperature rose from 30 °C to 50 °C. This observation clearly implies that the RO16 removal process on the surface of m-Cs-PVA/FA is an exothermic in nature [34]. This can be attributed to the adsorptive forces between the active sites of the adsorbent and the adsorbed adjacent dye molecules from liquid phase may be weakened as the temperature increases [57,58]. The third significant interactive effect on the removal of RO16 with p-value of 0.0173 can be observed between solution pH and contact time as illustrated in Fig. 9d. This significant interaction shows the essential role of the pH of the solution and contact time on the removal of RO16 by keeping other adsorption key parameters fixed at adsorbent dose = 0.06 g and working temperature 40 °C. It was observed that extending the contact time between the adsorbent/adsorbate system from 5 min to 30 min increased the RO16 removal from 17.45 to 90.3%. This notable increase in RO16 removal efficiency goes simultaneously as the pH of the dye solution is reduced from 10 to 4. A longer contact time will give sufficient time to the dye molecules to transfer from liquid phase of the dye bulk solution to the solid phase of the protonated surface of the adsorbent (m-Cs-PVA/FA) in acidic environment."
10,Effect of contact time and initial RO16 dye concentration,"3.3 Effect of contact time and initial RO16 dye concentration From the BBD results of the solo and collective significant interactions between the adsorption key parameters, the optimal conditions for RO16 removal (%) were determined as m-Cs-PVA/FA dose of 0.06 g, pH of dye solution (4), and working temperature 30 °C. These optimal adsorption key parameters were adopted for determining the effect of contact time at different RO16 dye initial concentrations on the adsorption capacity of m-Cs-PVA/FA. In this regard, Fig. 10a shows the plot of the amount of RO16 adsorbed (q t) against contact time at different RO16 initial concentrations ranging from 20 to 200 mg/L. From the plot, the adsorption capacity of m-Cs-PVA/FA was observed to increase from 33.49 mg/g to 159.95 mg/g when the RO16 concentrations increase from 20 mg/L to 200 mg/L. A greater amount of RO16 would rapidly saturate the available binding sites on the surface of the adsorbent at higher concentrations, and hence longer adsorption time is required [8]. In fact, dye of higher concentrations is more favourable due to the higher driving force transferring the RO16 molecules to the adsorption sites [34]."
11,Adsorption kinetic,"3.4 Adsorption kinetic Kinetics of the adsorption is a key element of adsorption study to fully understand the adsorption behaviour. The adsorption kinetics of m-Cs-PVA/FA was investigated by applying Lagergren pseudo-first order (PFO) [59], and pseudo-second order (PSO) [60]. The non-linear forms of PFO and PSO are given in Eqs. (5) and (6) respectively. (5) q t = q e 1 − exp − k 1 t (6) q t = q e 2 k 2 t 1 + q e k 2 t where, q t (mg/g) and q e (mg/g) are the amount of RO16 uptake by m-Cs-PVA/FA at time (t) and at equilibrium, accordingly. k 1 (1/min) and k 2 (g/mg min) are the corresponding rate constants of the two models, respectively. The kinetic parameters correlation coefficients (R 2) of these models are listed in Table 4 . It can be inferred from the R 2 values that the PSO model is the best fit model compared to PFO. In the case of the PSO model, the amounts of adsorption capacity calculated (q e cal ) were consistent with the experimental values of adsorption capacity (q e exp ) which confirms that kinetic data can be represented properly by the PSO model. This may lead to the inference of a greater affinity and rapid bonding of RO16 molecules to the surface of m-Cs-PVA/FA [61]."
12,Adsorption isotherm,"3.5 Adsorption isotherm Adsorption isotherm study is an essential way to understand the interaction between the dye molecules and the composite and also can be used to predict the adsorption capacity [51]. The adsorption isotherm models that were used to analyse the experimental data are Langmuir [62], Freundlich [63] and Temkin [64]. The Langmuir isotherm model assumes single-layer adsorption takes place on a homogenous surface having finite amount of available adsorption sites and the adsorbate molecules can only be distributed on the surface in a monolayer form [62,65]. The non-linear equation of Langmuir model can be expressed by Eq. (7). (7) q e = q max K a C e 1 + K a C e where, q e (mg/g) and q max (mg/g) represent the amount of RO16 adsorbed per unit mass at equilibrium and maximum adsorption capacity, respectively. K a (L/mg) is Langmuir constant and C e (mg/L) is the equilibrium concentration of RO16 dye. Meanwhile, the mechanism of multilayer adsorption is explained by Freundlich isotherm model assuming that the adsorbate molecules can be deposited in multiple layers on a heterogeneous surface [63]. The non-linear form of Freundlich isotherm model is expressed in Eq. (8). (8) q e = K f C e 1 n Where n and Kf (mg/g)(L/mg)1/n are the Freundlich constants which indicate the adsorption intensity and adsorption capacity, relatively. The effects on the adsorption from some indirect adsorbate/adsorbate interactions were considered by Temkin and Pyzhev [64]. This isotherm model suggests that the heat of adsorption of all the molecules in the layer would decline linearly because of indirect interactions between adsorbate/adsorbate. The Temkin isotherm can be describe in the Eq. (9): (9) q e = RT b T ln K T C e R (J/mol K) is the universal gas constant (8.314), T (K) is temperature, the Temkin constants b T and K T (L/mg) are related to the heat of adsorption and the equilibrium binding constant, respectively. From the isotherms plotted in Fig. 10b, the isotherms parameters were obtained and presented in Table 5 . As presented in Table 5, the experimental data fitted the best to Freundlich isotherm model with correlation coefficient (R 2) value of 0.98. Freundlich isotherm is found to be more accurate in explaining the adsorption process which can be associated by the various functional groups and structures on the adsorbate as it illustrates that the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent m-Cs-PVA/FA and the multiple layer adsorption occurs on the surface of the adsorbent with irregular heat energy distribution [31]. The maximum adsorption capacity of m-Cs-PVA/FA for the adsorption of RO16 was found to be 123.8 mg/g at 30 °C. The adsorption capacity of m-Cs-PVA/FA towards RO16 was compared with various types of adsorbents, that reported in the literature as recorded in Table 6 . The results indicate preferable adsorptive performance, which can be potentially applied as a recoverable biocomposite adsorbent for removal of reactive dyes and other water contaminants."
13,Adsorption mechanism,"3.6 Adsorption mechanism The proposed mechanisms for the adsorption of RO16 dye onto m-Cs-PVA/FA are illustrated in Fig. 11 . Cs contains large amounts of amino and hydroxyl functional groups, making it as an ideal adsorbent for removing anionic pollutants from the aqueous systems. These amino groups are easily protonated in acidic medium, enabling them to strongly adsorb anionic dyes through strong electrostatic attraction (Fig. 11a). Other forces, such as dipole-dipole hydrogen bonding (Fig. 11b), Yoshida H-bonding (Fig. 11c) and n-π stacking interactions (Fig. 11d), may also play a significant role in the adsorption process mechanism. Dipole-dipole hydrogen bonding and Yoshida H-bonding are hydrogen interactions formed by the interaction of H and OH available on the surface of m-Cs-PVA/FA with N and the aromatic rings in the RO16 dye structure [34,41]. Lastly, n-π stacking interactions may occur due to the delocalization of lone pair electrons on an oxygen atom and nitrogen atom into the π orbital of aromatic rings in the RO16 dye structure [71]."
14,Conclusion,"Synthesis of the m-Cs-PVA/FA biocomposite was performed and it was applied for removing RO16 dye from aquatic environment. Box-Behnken design model was applied to investigate the impact of four independent factors: adsorbent dose, temperature, pH and contact time on the removal of RO16 dye. The experimental data were interpreted using the second-order polynomial regression model, which had a coefficient of determination R 2 value of 0.95 and F-value of 20.05, and the maximum adsorption of RO16 was estimated to be up to 90.3% within the range studied. The quadratic model fit the experimental data well based on the p-value obtained. The optimal conditions obtained for the RO16 removal were 0.06 g of adsorbent dose, pH solution of 4, adsorption time of 17.5 min and adsorption temperature of 30 °C. The isotherm data fit best with Freundlich isotherm model and the q max computed by Langmuir isotherm was 123.8 mg/g. Kinetic experimental data demonstrated that the process of the adsorption followed pseudo-first order kinetics."
