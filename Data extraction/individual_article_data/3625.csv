0,Introduction,"The catalytic hydrogenation of aldehydes to the corresponding alcohols is an active task of research in both industrial and academic environments due to the importance of the resulting product as key intermediate for the synthesis of fine chemicals [1]. In particular, the reduction of benzaldehydes to benzylalcohols is of significant interest due to the commercial importance of benzylalcohols as solvent and as precursors in the synthesis of a wide variety of esters used in the flavor and fragrance and cosmetic industries [2]. This reaction is mainly promoted by catalytic systems based on noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh) [3] and transition metals (Cu, Co, Ni) [4]. However, the selectivity of many systems is still low due to the tendency of benzyl alcohols to give the corresponding methyl arenes under the reaction conditions commonly used for the hydrogenation [5]. Furthermore, in the case of heterogeneous catalysts, not only the nature of the metal but also the choice of an appropriate support upon which to disperse a metal can have a relevant effect on both the activity and selectivity [6]. As a matter of fact a large variety of support have been used for palladium catalyzed hydrogenation of benzaldehyde comprising Al2O3 [7], SiO2 [8], carbon nanotubes [9], and bentonite [10]. Moreover, recently, many Pd based catalytic systems have been developed varying the preparation strategy to obtain high reactivity catalysts in important industrial hydrogenation processes such as alkyne reduction [11]. In such scenario the study of new support for palladium based catalysts is highly desirable in order to improve the catalytic performances. For its chemical structure and its high thermal stability mayenite represents a good candidate to this purpose. Indeed, the use of mayenite as substrate for Ni catalyst was reported for biomass tar steam reforming. O2 2− and O2 − inhibit Ni poisoning by sulfur incorporation in the cages [12]. Hosono et al. have investigated the partial oxidation of methane to CO and H2 over mayenite promoted metals such as Ni, Co, Pt, Rh and Ru [13]. Mayenite derivates were obtained exchanging the O2− anions for other various ions, such as OH− [14], F− and Cl− [15], O2 − [16] and H− [17,18]. Notably, such material, to the best of our knowledge, has not been used yet as support for noble metals in the catalytic hydrogenation. In this communication, we report on the use of mayenite hydrides as support for palladium to form a highly active and selective catalyst for the catalytic reduction of benzaldehyde. The complete characterization of the obtained catalyst by BET surface area, XRD spectra, and electronic microscopy (SEM and TEM) was also done. In addition, the selectivity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde was also investigated giving intriguing results."
1,Experimental part,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation As in our previous work [19–21], mesoporous mayenite was prepared by sol–gel synthesis (see Supporting info). Palladium loaded mayenite was prepared by reduction of PdCl2 with NaBH4 in a THF solution. 0.0895g of PdCl2 and 4.9481g of mayenite were added to 250mL of distilled water. The mixture was stirred for 4h at room temperature than the solid was filtered and dried at 120°C for 20h and was added to a 0.1M solution of NaBH4 in anhydrous THF. The mixture was stirred for 5h then the catalyst was recovered by filtration, washed with hot distilled water and dried at 250°C for 16h and calcined at 800°C for 4h. A commercial 1% Pd/C catalyst was also used for comparison. All reagents were purchased at reagent grade from Sigma Aldrich and used as received."
3,Support characterization,"2.2 Support characterization X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance automatic diffractometer operating with a nickel-filtered CuKα radiation. The BET surface area of the catalyst was determined using a Nova Quantachrome 4200e instrument using nitrogen as the probe molecule at liquid nitrogen temperature (−196°C). The morphological and elemental analyses have been performed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Tescan Vega LMU) equipped with an X-ray energy dispersive microanalysis of elements having an atomic number >4, with a resolution of MnKα less than 123eV (100.000cps) (EDX, Bruker Quantax 800). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by using a Jeol Jem 1011 microscope (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan) operating at an accelerating voltage of 100kV."
4,Hydrogen sorption test and hydride characterization,"2.3 Hydrogen sorption test and hydride characterization Hydrogen adsorption isotherm at 25°C over the range 1–15bar was obtained using a Quantachrome I-Sorb HP using ultra pure 6.0 grade H2 (99.9999%V; Rivoira). Prior to the measurements, samples were degassed at 200°C for 48h. Analyses were conducted on 0.5g of sample. Hydride characterization was made by 1H NMR magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectra measured with a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer. The rotation frequency was 15kHz. Experiment was conducted on ca. 0.1g of powdered sample. Chemical shift scales were calibrated with the methylene absorption of the adamantine standard."
5,Aldehyde reduction,"2.4 Aldehyde reduction Benzaldehyde hydrogenation using solely mayenite was carried out in a high-pressure reactor of 150mL capacity equipped with a pressure gauge, safety valve, valves for gas inlet and outlet and a thermocouple for temperature sensing. 0.5g of mayenite and 5mL of benzaldehyde (>99%, Sigma Aldrich) were added into a glass vial equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The reactor was charged with pure hydrogen (>99%, Rivoira) at a pressure of 8bar and maintained at 120°C. The reaction was carried out for different times (1 to 168h) and samples were analyzed using GC–MS instrument (Agilent 7890A) with HP-INNOWAX fused silica capillary column. Aldehyde hydrogenation with metal loaded mayenite (Pd/mayenite 1wt.%) was conducted at 20 and 120°C at a hydrogen pressure of 8bar in the range 1–24h, using 10mL of diethyl ether as solvent (>99.5%, Sigma Aldrich) and a substrate/metal ratio of 1000 (0.025g catalyst and 0.25mL benzaldehyde). For comparison reactions with Pd/C 1wt.% were conducted using the same substrate/metal ratio and reaction conditions."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Support characterization,"3.1 Support characterization The structure of mayenite has been characterized by means of X-ray diffractometry. XRD studies were carried out for (A) 1wt.% Pd/mayenite and (B) mayenite as shown in Fig. 1 . Since the metal loading was very low no characteristic peak for Pd (111) was obtained at 2θ=40°. Together with the major mayenite phase, two minor phases namely Ca3Al2O6 and CaAl2O4 were detected as shown in our previous work [21]. Palladium content in mayenite was determined by ICP-OES analysis by digesting the sample in aqua regia (37% HCl and 70% HNO3 3:1 ratio). The metal loading found out was 1.09% for Pd/mayenite. BET surface areas of mayenite based materials and commercial Pd/C catalyst have been measured (see Supporting info). An unexpected increase in the surface area of mayenite after Pd loading was observed (from 5.4 to 16.9m2/g). Actually, the loading of a metal on a substrate results commonly in a reduction of the surface area due to the filling of the pores by the metal particles [22]. In our case such increase is probably due to the milling of the substrate before Pd loading and during the catalyst preparation process involving continuous stirring and reaction of the support with water that causes mayenite hydrated species formation [21]. Furthermore as evidenced by the X-ray analysis (Fig. 1) the Pd loaded mayenite shows a lower degree of crystallinity with a consequent increase of the amorphous phase that we hypothesize can be related to the increase of the surface area. SEM images in Fig. 2A show that mayenite is characterized by the presence of sheets and two types of pores can be observed: large macropores on the μm scale (see the left column of Fig. 2) and mesopores on the nm scale (see the right column of Fig. 2). From SEM images presented, it can be seen that the Pd/mayenite sample (Fig. 2B) still retains significant porosity, even if the sheets seem to be grown during the catalyst preparation. However, both macropores and mesopores can be still observed in Pd/mayenite sample. EDS analysis of the material shows that Pd is not uniformly distributed on mayenite (see Supporting info). TEM micrographs were also taken to show Pd particles into the mayenite structure. Picture shows that palladium particles were in the nano-range but not well dispersed (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 4 illustrates the hydrogen sorption isotherms of mayenite collected at 25°C. The maximum amount of hydrogen sorbed as hydride results in 2.4∗1018 cm−3, considering a mayenite density of 2.85g/cm3. This value is two orders lower than that reported by Hayashi [14] of 2.5∗1020 cm−3 obtained after hydrogen sorption on mayenite at 1300°C because, as expected, temperature plays an important role on the dissociation of hydrogen molecules. Hydride ions incorporated into the cages of mayenite after H2 adsorption at 25°C for 48h have been characterized by 1H-MAS NMR. The signal at 4.9ppm is assigned to the H− ions in cages according to literature [23]."
8,Aldehyde hydrogenation,"3.2 Aldehyde hydrogenation Catalytic activity was evaluated using high-pressure reactor. Benzaldehyde was chosen as model compound for hydrogenation reactions. Firstly, in order to assess the role of mayenite in the hydrogenation reaction we used mayenite hydride without metal impregnation under hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of benzaldehyde (120°C, 8bar). Notably, the conversion of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol was observed with good selectivity (92% benzyl alcohol) but with low activity (12% conversion after one week). Notwithstanding this result is not significant in term of conversion this behavior reveals an important aspect referred to the reactivity of the mayenite containing H− ions. Remarkably, when benzaldehyde hydrogenation was carried out using 0.5g of mayenite hydride (preformed through thermal treatment at 1300°C of mayenite under hydrogen atmosphere 4h, 8bar H2) and 0.5mL of benzaldehyde dissolved in 10mL of diethyl ether at 25°C for 3days, without feeding hydrogen, benzyl alcohol was selectively formed with the same conversion of 12% indicating that the reduction is due to the stoichiometric reaction of hydride contained in the mayenite structure showing the non-innocent nature of such support. Consequently, we explored the possibility to use mayenite as support for palladium in the hydrogenation reaction comparing the results obtained in the presence of such non-innocent substrate to a well-known, commercially available, catalytic system such as palladium supported on charcoal (Pd/C). In order to evaluate the effect of temperature on conversion, the reactions were carried at 20 and 120°C. The effect of temperature and the reaction time on the conversion of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol is shown in Fig. 5 and the results are reported in more detail in Table 1 . One can observe that the conversion increases considerably with temperature giving only the 14% of conversion after 1h at 20°C and the 66% at 120°C respectively. Notably the selectivity toward benzyl alcohol is retained at high temperature using mayenite as substrate (>99%) and changing the solvent from diethylether to ethanol does not affect significantly the catalytic activity and selectivity (see Supporting). In the case of Pd/C catalyst increasing the temperature from 20 to 120°C has an even stronger effect on the catalytic activity (after 1h the conversion is 11% at 20°C and 80% at 120°C respectively) but the selectivity toward benzyl alcohol falls down from 100% at 20°C to 13% at 120°C. Indeed the analysis of the reaction mixture reveals the presence of benzyl ether as the only by-product. The formation of this compound instead of the desired benzyl alcohol is reasonably due to the presence of the acidic charcoal as substrate that can promote the etherification reaction of the formed benzyl alcohol [24]. Such reaction pathway is confirmed by the fact, that the formation of benzyl ether is favored in increasing the reaction time. The performances of our catalytic system were consistent with those reported in literature in terms of conversion using palladium intercalated bentonite catalyst (95% after 5h at 100°C) but in this last case increasing the temperature from 50 to 100°C has a detrimental effect on the selectivity [10]. For all the experiments performed, carbon balance based on the carbon content in the unconverted aldehydes and in the hydrogenation products is systematically calculated and is in all cases higher than 95%. Finally, the catalyst presents also a moderate recyclability maintaining good conversion (>90%) and selectivity (>99%) after 3cycles of use and resulting in a drop of the catalytic performance only at the fourth cycle (70%). In order to test the selectivity in a multifunctional molecule, palladium loaded mayenite (1% wt) was also employed in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. Hydrogenations were carried out using both Pd/C and Pd/mayenite catalysts using the optimized conditions, in terms of conversion, for benzaldehyde (t=5h; T=120°C; P (H2)=8bar; 10mL of Et2O as solvent). As reported in literature, hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde leads to different products depending on the active metal, solvent and promoter [8]. The possible product originating by cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation is reported in Scheme 1 (see Supporting info). Under these conditions, on the one hand the Pd/C catalyst converts quantitatively the substrate giving a mixture of hydrocinnamyl alcohol (65%) and hydroxycinnamaldehyde (35%). On the other hand using Pd/mayenite under the same reaction conditions the conversion is also quantitative with 83% of hydroxycinnamaldehyde and 17% of hydrocinnamyl alcohol showing a higher selectivity toward the reduction of double bond with respect to the aldehydic function. These results confirm the wide applicability of the palladium loaded mayenite as hydrogenation catalyst to different aldehydes with excellent performance."
9,Conclusions,"In this work, mayenite substrate was used, for the first time, as active catalyst support for palladium and the resulting catalyst was fully characterized. Pd/mayenite catalyst with low metal loading (1%) was employed in the catalytic reduction of benzaldehyde showing high performances in terms of conversion and selectivity compared to commercial Pd/C catalyst. In particular, mayenite substrate has been shown to be a robust support also at high temperatures (120°C) inhibiting byproduct formation and preserving a high selectivity in the benzyl alcohol production. A preliminary study conducted on the cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation reaction confirms the applicability of Pd loaded mayenite as an effective catalyst to a wide range of substrates."
