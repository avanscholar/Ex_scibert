0,Introduction,"Over the years, biopolymeric contructs like films, hydrogels and beads have gone through various qualitative transformations to meet the changing requirement of the end users (Ahmed, 2015; El-Sherbiny & Yacoub, 2013; Luo & Wang, 2014). Among all the parameters, the most noticeable change has been observed in the composition of the formulations. In recent reviews by Venkatesan et al. (2015) and Pina et al. (2015), have nicely described how, over the years, the constituents of the polymeric structures changes from single polymer to multi-ingredient system (Pina, Oliveira, & Reis, 2015; Venkatesan, Bhatnagar, Manivasagan, Kang, & Kim, 2015). A review of the literature revealed that a combination of synthetic- natural polymeric composites has emerged as a choice of material for such formulation (Mogoşanu & Grumezescu, 2014; Pina et al., 2015). This kind of hybrid composite offers better mechanical and thermal stability, controllable degradation and swelling, and drug release properties (Azwa, Yousif, Manalo, & Karunasena, 2013; Thakur, Thakur, & Gupta, 2014). So far, many such formulations have been reported in the literature for different but specific applications. Some of the natural polymers used in such formulations include gelatin, chitosan, alginate, chitin, collagen, and pectin, whereas, the synthetic polymers used in such formulations include polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly methyl methacrylate, poly urethane, poly vinyl pyrollidone, poly lactides and poly glycolides (Birch, Barney, Pandres, Peyton, & Schiffman, 2015; Das, Behera, Singh, Rizvi, & Singh, 2016; Hu et al., 2014; Kuhn & Zussman, 2015; Maguire, Waldron, Harrington, & Moore, 2014). In recent years, natural gums like guar gum, gum arabic and tragacanth gum have been gaining importance as a new set of natural polymers in pharmaceutics (Prajapati, Jani, Moradiya, & Randeria, 2013). Many of the gums have shown good swelling, viscosity enhancing property and specific biological response like antibacterial, antifungal and wound healing (Choudhary & Pawar, 2014; Jana, Banerjee, Sen, & Maiti, 2016). Among these new set of gums, tamarind gum and its derivatives, especially carboxymethyl tamarind gum (CMT), has shown promises as a novel material (Das, Dutta, Nayak, & Nanda, 2014). The researchers have preferred CMT because of its improved resistance to microbial degradation, viscosity enhancing property and more importantly, its cell proliferative property (Shaw et al., 2016). Keeping its physicochemical and biological properties in mind, here we have developed a set CMT- based natural-synthetic films for biomedical applications. PVA has been chosen as the synthetic counterpart of CMT. PVA is a water-soluble linear biopolymer (Sharma et al., 2014). This polymer has been extensively used for drug delivery and wound dressing applications (Abdelgawad, Hudson, & Rojas, 2014; Scott, Park, & Panitch, 2013). It helps in improving mechanical properties of the formulations (Karimi & Navidbakhsh, 2014). Additionally, PVA formulations, especially films, possess good transparency, which may improve patient compliance (Arun, 2014; Sugumaran et al., 2015). Moreover, PVA can be crosslinked by conventional chemical crosslinkers like glutaraldehyde in a cost-effective manner (Destaye, Lin, & Lee, 2013). However, like most of the synthetic polymers, PVA lacks cell-specific bioactivities (Zhu & Marchant, 2011). Taking a note from the above facts, here, we have taken a venture to prepare CMT-PVA films with improved physicochemical and biological properties. The films were made by the conventional solution- casting (Patel & Sureshkumar, 2014) and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, mechanical, thermal, antimicrobial and cytocompatibility studies. In the study, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride was used as a model drug. It is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone class and is widely used to treat infections of the skin and the soft tissue, such as infected ulcers, wounds or burns, abscesses, cellulitis and erysipelas. In recent years, a number pharmaceutical formulations containing ciprofloxacin has been reported. Many of these formulations are prepared to treat skin infection and wound healing."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA (Av. Mol. Wt.: 1,25,000g and Av.% hydrolysis: 99%) was procured from Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India. CMT (Av. Mol. Wt.: 9.14×105 g/mole; degree of carboxylation: 0.372) was purchased from Maruti Hydrocolloids, India. Dialysis membrane (60kDa), glutaraldehyde (25%, GA) and hydrochloric acid (35% pure) were obtained from Merck Specialists Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India. Ethanol was purchased from Honyon International Inc., Hong Yong Chemical Corporations, China. Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride was a gift from Aristo Pharmaceuticals, Bhopal, India. Nutrient broth, nutrient agar, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), Trypsin-EDTA solution, MTT assay kit were procured from Hi-media Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from GIBCO, India. HaCat cell line was procured from NCCS Pune, India. Double distilled water was used throughout the study."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Preparation of films PVA solution 10% (w/w) was prepared by dissolving required quantity of PVA in water at 80°C. Aqueous CMT solutions of different concentrations (0.25% (w/w), 1% (w/w), and 2% (w/w)) were also prepared separately. The PVA-CMT films were prepared by conventional solution casting method (Ionita, Pandele, & Iovu, 2013). In brief, the PVA (18g) and the CMT (2g) solutions were mixed at 60°C with continuous stirring at 200rpm in a magnetic stirrer for 5min. To this mixture, 20g of water was added, and the mixture was further homogenized for 5min, under the same conditions. The mixture was degassed by sonicating in a bath sonicator for 30min 2ml of crosslinking reagent (composition: 10ml GA, 10ml of ethanol, 0.1ml of hydrochloric acid) was added to the above mixture, homogenized under same condition and allowed to stand for 30min at room temperature (25°C). Subsequently, 20g of the resultant solution was poured onto polypropylene plates (diameter: 8cm). Thereafter, the petri- plates were transferred to a temperature- controlled thermal cabinet (37°C) and dried for 48h. The dried films were thoroughly washed with 90% ethanol to remove any unwanted reactant, dried again and stored in air-tight zip-lock packets at room temperature for further analysis. The films made with 0.25% (w/w), 1% (w/w), 2% (w/w) CMT solutions were regarded as PC1, PC2, and PC3, respectively. The film, without CMT, was used as the control (PC0) in this study. Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride loaded films were also prepared following the same solution- casting method. Here, 400mg of the drug was dissolved in the polymer mixture before the addition of the crosslinker. The drug containing films were regarded as PC0D, PC1D, PC2D, and PC3D. Table 1 summarizes the composition of the films. 2.2.2 Microstructure analysis The microstructure of the films was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL- JSM 6480, Japan). Before the analysis, the films were sputter-coated with gold. Images were taken at an accelerating voltage of 10KV. 2.2.3 Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis The infrared spectra of the films were acquired using an ATR-FTIR spectrometer (AlphaE ATR-FTIR, Bruker, Germany). ZnSe ATR element was used for the acquisition and the analysis of the sample spectra. The scanning was performed over a wavenumber range of 4000–400cm−1. 2.2.4 Analysis of the stress relaxation properties The mechanical properties of the films were measured using a static mechanical tester (TA HD-plus, Stable Micro Systems, Haskmere, England) in extension mode. The films were cut into rectangular pieces (60mm x 5mm). The samples were secured in the sample holders such that the window length (sample length) was 50mm. The samples were stretched at a rate of 1mm/sec up to a distance of 5mm. The probe was then allowed to stay at the same position for 60s to allow the relaxation process to undergo within the films (Bellido & Hatcher, 2009; Ponnamma, Sadasivuni, Strankowski, Guo, & Thomas, 2013). 2.2.5 Analysis of the thermal properties The films were subjected to thermal analysis using differential scanning calorimeter (Shimadzu DSC-60A, Japan). A portion of the films (7–10 mg) was hermetically sealed in aluminum pans and was heated from room temperature to 200°C. It was then cooled to 30°C and re-heated to 250°C. The scan rate (heating/cooling rate) was kept constant at 10°C/min. Empty aluminum pan was used as the control. 2.2.6 Antimicrobial study The antimicrobial property of the drug loaded films was tested against E. coli by disc diffusion method. Briefly, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (drug) loaded films were punch cut into discs (Diameter: 3mm, drug content 1μg). Prior to the experiment, E. coli culture (100μl of E. coli suspension of 1×106 CFU/ml) was evenly spread over the surface of the nutrient agar bacterial culture plate. Filter paper disc, soaked in drug solution (10μl of drug solution (100μg/ml concentration)), served as the positive control. Blank films were taken as negative control. The petri- plates were incubated at 37°C for 6h. At the end of the incubation time, the zone of inhibition of the microbial growth was measured using a scale. 2.2.7 Cell proliferation study The films were cast in the wells of a 96 well tissue culture plate following the protocol mentioned in Section 2.2.1 using sterile solutions. The dried films were first treated with 0.1M glycine solution for 30min to neutralize unreacted GA. Later, the films were thoroughly washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and equilibrated with incomplete DMEM media. HaCat cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS along with 1% antibiotic and antimycotic solution in a humidified (95%) CO2 incubator (37°C). Prior to the experiments, cells were harvested from 70 to 80% confluence T-25 flask by trypsinization. The viability of the harvested cells was confirmed by trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Cell population showing more than 90% viability was used for further experimentation. 1×104 cells were seeded into each well of 96 well plate and incubated for another 48h in complete DMEM media inside the CO2 incubator. After 48h, the viability of the cells was tested by MTT assay. The assay was performed using a commercial MTT assay kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions."
4,Results,
5,Synthesis and microstructure analysis,"3.1 Synthesis and microstructure analysis Solution casting method was found suitable for the production of PVA-CMT films. In this study, concentrated polymeric solutions were used for the preparation of the films. After mixing of the polymeric solutions, the mixture was diluted. This was intentionally done to obtain biphasic microarchitecture of the films. The dried films could be harvested easily from the molds. The prepared films were transparent and flexible in nature. Analysis of the SEM micrograph (Fig. 1 ) revealed that the surface of the PVA film was a bit wrinkled. In the case of CMT containing films, the presence of globular structures embedded within a continuous polymer matrix was observed. An increase in the CMT proportion causes the variation in surface topology. It appears as an inter-connected network at the higher proportion of CMT. The micrographs indicate the possibility of formation of phase-separated matrices. Earlier, similar structures were reported as phase-separated matrices (Ersch, van der Linden, Venema, & Martin, 2016; Firoozmand & Rousseau, 2013)."
6,FTIR analysis,"3.2 FTIR analysis The FTIR spectra showed the presence of the characteristic peaks of the functional groups of PVA in PVA-CMT films. The peaks include 3260cm−1 (OH stretching), 2916cm−1 (CH2 group), 1744cm−1 (CO stretching), 1415cm−1 (CHOH group), 1090cm−1 (CO stretching) and 916cm−1 (CC stretching of the alkane groups) (Fig. 2 ) (Santos et al., 2014). Interestingly, it was observed that peaks corresponding to the functional groups of CMT were masked in the composite films. This was explained by the fact that the polysaccharide content was much lower as compared to the PVA molecules. The FTIR peaks in the wavenumber range of 4000cm−1 and 2500cm−1 were deconvoluted from the spectra. The area under the curve of the peak located at ∼3260cm−1 was calculated. The area under the curve helps to estimate the strength of the vibration due to a specific functional group (Martins, Cerqueira, & Vicente, 2012). The area under the peak at the position (∼3260cm−1) provides information about the intermolecular hydrogen bonding amongst the components of the films. It was found that, with the incorporation of CMT within the PVA matrix, there was a considerable decrease in the intermolecular hydrogen bonding in PC1 as compared to control. With the increase in the CMT content, there was an increase in the area under the curve of the peak which attained a higher critical limit in PC2. A further increase in the CMT content resulted in the decrease in the area under the curve. From the results, it can be explained that as the CMT content was increased in the PVA-CMT films, there was an initial increase of the extent of intermolecular hydrogen bonding till a critical higher limit and thereafter, it decreased. Such variation can be explained by the number of the available polar groups available for intermolecular hydrogen bonding. In the case of PC1 and PC2, a lower concentration of CMT (the source of OH and COOH groups) was present. These functional groups are responsible for hydrogen bonding. However, the hydrogen bonding was less for PC3 (even though the CMT content was highest). This was because the CMT existed as agglomerates, which lowered the effective CMT- PVA interface surface area and consequently reduced the possibility of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. An increase in the intermolecular hydrogen bonding results in the formation of intercalated structures amongst the two phases of the composites (Lee et al., 2002). The phenomenon of formation of intercalated structures improves the mechanical strength of the composites. Similarly, many authors have reported that increased hydrogen bonding can improve the thermal stability of the composite materials (Salavagione et al., 2009; Vogt et al., 1997). Hence, it can be expected that the mechanical and the thermal properties of PC2 will be much better than the other films."
7,Analysis of the stress relaxation properties,"3.3 Analysis of the stress relaxation properties The mechanical property of the films was analyzed using stress relaxation study (Fig. 3 a–d, Table 2 ). During the extension of the films, an increase in the stress was observed, which reached a maximum (σmax) at the end of the extension process. The σmax value of PC0 (PVA film) was ∼1.148kg/mm2. Incorporation of CMT resulted in 1.2 fold and 1.4 fold increase in the σmax values in PC1 and PC2, respectively. This suggested an increase in the firmness of the PVA films with the initial incorporation of CMT. The increase in the firmness in PVA-CMT films can be explained by the filler effect exerted by the polysaccharide phase (Ravi, Kumar, Mohan, & Rao, 2014). Thereafter, a further increase in the CMT content (PC3) significantly decreased the σmax value. This can be explained by the generation of a large number of defects (Liu, Shi, Weng, Ding, & Cui, 2014) in the polymeric architecture due to the formation of a dense interconnected CMT phase (as seen in Fig. 1). The variation in the firmness of the films can further be explained by the variation in the intermolecular hydrogen bonding within the films (as estimated from the FTIR study). An increase in the hydrogen bonding is associated with the increase in the crystallinity and the mechanical strength of the polymer matrices (Zhang et al., 2012). After the extension of the films, the probe was held stationary for 60s. During this period, there was an exponential decrease in the stress values. This process is regarded as the stress relaxation process (Ponnamma et al., 2013). The stress reduced to the residual stress values (σmin). The σmin is the stress retained in the sample after the relaxation process. The σmin provides information about the retained elastic component. The σmin values of PC0 and PC1 was same. The σmin of PC2 was significantly increased with the increase in the CMT content. Thereafter, a further increase in the CMT content in PC3 drastically reduced the σmin value. The percentage stress relaxation (%SR) value was calculated using Eq. (1) (Hejlova & Blahovec, 2015). (1) % S R = σ max − σ min σ max × 100 where, σmax is the maximum stress attained during the extension stage (Kg/mm2) and σmin is the residual stress at the end of the relaxation period (Kg/mm2). %SR provides overall information about the viscous and the elastic components within the samples. An l00%SR value suggests an ideal liquid sample with a complete viscous component within the samples. On the other hand, the 0%SR value indicates an ideal elastic sample. The %SR values of all the films were in the range of 30% and 40%, suggesting viscoelastic nature. The %SR of PC3 and PC1 were lowest and highest, respectively. The incorporation of CMT initially increased the viscous component of the films. Amongst the CMT containing films, there was a decrease in the%SR values with the increase in the CMT content. This suggested an increase in the elastic component due to the improvement in the reinforcement effect exerted by the filler phase when the CMT content was increased. The improved stress transfer can explain this (Le Goff et al., 2015). The process of relaxation is a complex phenomenon and is affected by a number of factors including polymer molecule flexibility, polymer–polymer interactions, polymer-filler interactions, the strength of the interactions as mentioned above and strength of the polymer molecules (Shenoy, 2013; Yang et al., 2015). The relaxation profile (Fig. 3d) was analyzed using Weichert model (Eq. (2)) to understand the viscoelastic properties of the films. Though Weichert model consists of multiple numbers of Hookian and viscous elements, which increase the complexity of the model, researchers have reported that the accuracy of prediction of the physical phenomenon of the relaxation process is superior (Gautieri, Vesentini, Redaelli, & Ballarini, 2013). The model parameters were calculated by fitting the normalized relaxation profiles (Fig. 3f). The normalization of the SR profiles was done by dividing the stress values with the σmax values. P0 denotes the retained elastic energy within the films at the end of the relaxation process. The relaxation times (τ1-instantaneous, τ2- intermediate, τ3- delayed) provide information on the polymeric interactions during the relaxation process (Maria et al., 2014). The instantaneous and intermediate relaxation time of the PVA-CMT films were found longer than that of control. This suggested that the rearrangement of the polymer molecules under stress was relatively slower in the PVA-CMT films. Hence, it can be concluded that incorporation of CMT decreases the molecular rearrangement of the composite films by efficiently transferring the applied stress across the CMT and the PVA phases (Le Goff et al., 2015). The delayed relaxation time, a measure of polymeric chain breakage when subjected to stress, did not show any significant changes. This suggests that the mechanical property was mainly dominated by the external polymeric phase (in this case PVA), thereby, indicating that the PVA and the CMT phases were not miscible (Wu et al., 2004). This observation confirmed the formation of phase- separated systems (Wu et al., 2004). In gist, analysis of polymeric relaxation process of the composite films revealed that the addition of CMT improve the stability of the PVA films. This is important in the context of film handling and storage. (2) σ ( t ) σ max = P 0 + P 1 . e ( − t τ 1 ) + P 2 . e ( − t τ 2 ) + P 3 . e ( − t τ 3 ) where, P0, P1, P2 and P3 are the spring constants (unit less constants); and τ1, τ2 and τ3 are time constants of the dashpots (sec)."
8,Analysis of the thermal properties,"3.4 Analysis of the thermal properties In the first heating cycle, all the films showed a broad endothermic peak at ∼105°C (Fig. 4 ). The occurrence of this broad peak is due to the evaporation of the water molecules absorbed within the PVA and CMT polymeric chains. Observation of the thermal profiles suggested that the energy required for the evaporation of the bound water was highest in PC2 followed by PC1, PC3, and PC0, respectively. From the FTIR studies, it was evident that the intermolecular hydrogen bonding was highest in PC2 as compared to the other films. It is quite possible that the presence of strongly bound water molecules resulted in the increase in the hydrogen bonding. In addition to this broad peak, a peak corresponding to the glass transition temperature at ∼50°C was also observed. Similar observations were reported by Li et al. (2015) (Li et al., 2015). Though the glass transition temperature of pristine PVA is at ∼80°C (Jiang, 2007), the occurrence of the glass transition temperature at this lower temperature (50°C) can be explained either by the alteration in the thermal properties of the polymer during the film fabrication process or due to the presence of bound moisture within the films. The addition of CMT reduced the glass transition temperature to lower temperatures (from ∼50°C to 43–47°C) in a composition- dependent manner. The lowering of the glass transition temperature of PVA in the presence of polysaccharides is well documented in the literature (Kanimozhi, Khaleel Basha, & Sugantha Kumari, 2016). Such phenomenon is explained due to the increased mobility of the polymeric chains when thermal energy is supplied to the polymer matrix. Subsequent to the first heating cycle, the films were cooled to 30°C and were again heated to 250°C. This was done to have an understanding of the thermal properties of the films devoid of moisture content. From the analysis of the second heating cycle, it was observed that all the films showed a glass transition temperature at ∼80°C. This confirms our prediction that the presence of bound moisture within the films significantly reduced the glass transition temperature. In addition to the above peaks, a sharp endothermic peak was observed also at ∼220°C in all the films. This endothermic peak corresponds to the melting endotherm of the PVA molecules (Shao et al., 2016). This observation is in correspondence to the stress relaxation studies where it was found that the properties of the films were predominantly contributed by the PVA. The differences in the glass transition temperature in the first heating cycle of the films might have been affected by the presence of the bound water. The observation of the thermograms suggested that the thermal energy absorbed by the composite films were higher than the PVA film (PC0). Such an observation can be explained by the existence of the intercalated microarchitecture in the composite films which was capable of absorbing higher amount of thermal energy (Lee et al., 2002). Interestingly, the area under the melting endotherm (deconvoluted peak, Fig. 4c–f) of PC2 was significantly higher as compared to the other films. It is already reported that such phenomena happen because of the change in the crystalline nature of the polymers (Jung, Liu, Russell, & Jo, 2013). Therefore, it can be assumed that in PC2, the crystallinity of the polymeric chain increases. As discussed before, an increase in the crystallinity can significantly alter the mechanical property of the polymer matrices (Zhang et al., 2012). It is important to note that in the Weichert model of viscoelastic analysis (SR study), longer instantaneous and intermediate relaxation time was observed in PC2. Since, at the said composition, the thermal study indicated an increased crystallinity, the longer initial and intermediate relaxation time is quite justified. Further, the previous literature on the biphasic polymer matrices indicates that the increase in the crystallinity of the composite matrices is associated with the formation of intercalated microarchitecture (Le Goff et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2002). Hence, the thermal energy required to melt the PVA- CMT films (consisting of intercalated structures) are greater than the pristine PVA film. This suggest that incorporation of CMT in PVA films increase its thermal stability."
9,Antimicrobial study,"3.5 Antimicrobial study The antimicrobial property of the drug loaded films has been presented in Fig. 5 . It was found that all the drug loaded films were able to exhibit an inhibitory effect on the growth of E. coli, suggesting an antibacterial effect against the test microorganism. The blank film did not show any antimicrobial effect. Ciprofloxacin has been reported to inhibit the bacterial DNA gyrase enzyme activity, thereby, preventing the growth of microbial proliferation by stopping DNA replication of the bacteria (Hui, Sheardown, & Jones, 2012). The results suggested that the drug was present within the films in its active form and released in the surrounding from the polymeric matrix. However, we did not observe any significant variation in the ZOI diameter among the samples. This implies that addition of CMT has no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride loaded PVA film."
10,Cell proliferation study,"3.6 Cell proliferation study Nowadays, PVA- based films are widely used in wound dressing and skin tissue engineering applications (Zhou et al., 2007). In our recent report, we have shown that CMT can be used in skin tissue engineering (Shaw et al., 2016). Here, we have further tested the skin cell proliferation on the PVA-CMT films. For this purpose, human epidermal keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) was used. HaCaT cells are transformed but non-cancerous human epidermal keratinocytes (Dinić et al., 2015). This particular cell line shares many characteristics of primary human keratinocytes and is recognized as an accepted cellular candidate for probing epidermal biology in vitro (Boukamp et al., 1988). We observed that PC1 support cell proliferation to the highest extent among all the films followed by PC3 (Fig. 6 a). The cell viability for PC1 and PC3 with respect to control was found statistically significant, whereas, the same for PC2 was found insignificant. From the data, it was evident that no linear proportionality exists between proliferation and the relative weight percentage of CMT in the film. PVA is a synthetic polymer and do not contain any cell binding ligands like RGD. On the other hand, CMT is polysaccharide and contains biologically active sites. Therefore, the general expectation is that the cytocompatibility of the PVA-CMT film should increase with an increase in CMT proportion. However, in the present case we did not observed such a trend. In this regard it is important to mention that the adhesion and the proliferation of the cells not only depend on the chemical composition, but also with other physical factors like surface roughness, matrix stiffness etc. Two samples of same chemical composition can also have different spatial distribution of the cell binding ligands which will may cause a variation in cytocompatibility. In the present case, it is believed that the improved performance of PC1 may be result of the combine effect of optimum surface properties and ligand distribution. It is highly possible that the effect of CMT as ‘chemical cue' to the cell proliferation is concentration dependent and become significant in case of PC3. However, in case of PC1, although the contribution of CMT as chemical cue remain insignificant but because of the unique topography of the film (as observed by scanning electron microscope (Fig. 1)), cell proliferation got favoured and eventually become the best. On the other hand, the concentration of CMT (as chemical cue) present in PC2 was not sufficient to stimulate cell proliferation and it also lacks topographical feature as was observed in PC1. As a result, cell proliferation was found least in PC2. Phase contrast micrograph of the cells cultured on the films (Fig. 6b) further revealed that the cells spread well on the film surface, which implied the conducive environment provided by the films."
11,Conclusions,"The current study showed that physicochemical as well as biological properties of PVA film can be effectively improved by the application of CMT as co-ingredient. The study confirmed improved performance of PVA-CMT films in terms of mechanical, thermal and biological properties. Interestingly, such improvement was found dependent on the concentration of CMT. Mechanistic analysis implied three possible reasons behind such improvement in properties that include the existence of greater intermolecular hydrogen bonding, an enhanced crystallinity of polymers and low molecular rearrangement under stress. The study suggests a potential application of the PVA-CMT films in wound dressings and other skin diseases where topical application of the drug is required. However, a detailed study on the performance of the films in vivo needs to be carried out."
