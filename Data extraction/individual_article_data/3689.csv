0,Introduction,"With the present urgent demand for clean energy production from renewable sources, heterogeneous photocatalysis confirms to be an environmentally friendly method to produce hydrogen, the most attractive energy vector for the future. Amongst the possible photocatalytic materials for this application, titanium dioxide still remains the most employed and investigated semiconductor oxide photocatalyst, mainly because of its peculiar physical and chemical properties [1], although encouraging results have been recently obtained also employing carbon nitride-based photocatalysts [2,3]. However, the fruitful exploitation of solar light to directly split pure water into H2 and O2, with zero CO2 emission, needs to face with both the high Gibbs free energy associated to such process (+237kJmol−1, 1.23eV) and the fast back-reaction occurring between the two gas products [4]. Moreover, photocatalytic H2 production does not efficiently proceed on bare TiO2, mainly due to the rapid recombination of photoproduced electron-hole pairs, which largely reduces the fraction of photogenerated charge carriers effectively involved in this thermodynamically up-hill reaction. The addition of organic compounds, possibly deriving from renewable sources (i.e. biomass), to the aqueous reaction media proved to be successful to overpass such limitations [5]. In fact, organic molecules, such as alcohols, are not only additional proton sources, but also efficient hole scavengers which undergo fast and irreversible oxidation, thus making photopromoted electrons more readily available for proton reduction to hydrogen [6]. The separation of photoproduced charge carriers can be further increased by loading noble metal (i.e. Pt, Pd, Au) nanoparticles (NPs) on the semiconductor surface, because of their ability to capture photopromoted electrons [7,8]. Platinum is considered the most effective co-catalyst to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2, but its high cost may strongly limit the widespread use of Pt/TiO2 photocatalytic materials, especially for industrial applications. Many efforts have thus been recently directed towards TiO2 surface modification with less expensive metals (e.g., Cu, Ni, Ag), eventually coupled with low amounts of noble metal NPs, to increase the photoactivity in both wastewater treatments (organic pollutants degradation) [9,10] and H2 evolution from water [11]. For instance, the co-deposition of Au NPs together with Ni or Cu NPs, anchored on TiO2 in different oxidation states, produced an effective increase of the photocatalytic production of H2 with respect to that attained with Au/TiO2 materials [12]. Very recently, TiO2 surface modified with radiolysis-synthesized nickel and gold NPs was found to have synergistic effects in increasing the rate of H2 formation from aqueous methanol solutions [13]. The use of Cu as relatively cheap and abundant co-catalyst can lead to highly efficient TiO2-based photocatalysts. Starting from the pioneering work by Irie et al. [14], grafting of Cu2+ ions mainly on rutile TiO2 was successfully applied to get visible light activation of the semiconductor without introducing impurity levels into the bulk of TiO2 and beneficial effects were attained not only in the photodecomposition of air pollutants (e.g. acetaldehyde) or in antibacterial applications under aerobic conditions, but also in H2 evolution under anaerobic conditions, with results superior to those obtained with Ni-loaded TiO2 [15]. In fact, since both the redox potential of the Cu2+/Cu+ couple and the potential of the conduction band (CB) of crystalline CuO are less negative than the CB of TiO2, CuO domains on the TiO2 surface may capture photoexcited electrons with the consequent partial reduction of copper and beneficial charge carriers separation [16]. The activity of Cu-containing TiO2-based photocatalysts was found to be affected by different properties such as the oxidation state of copper, the dispersion and morphology of metal and/or metal oxide NPs on the TiO2 surface, including the crystallinity [17] and size of CuO clusters [18], as well as by the phase composition of TiO2 [19]. Such key parameters can be modulated during the photocatalyst preparation and innovative synthetic routes were developed to this aim, including the use of water-in-oil microemulsions [20] or solvothermal microwave procedures [21]. At the same time, too high copper loading and calcination temperature, which are generally employed to get a solid CuO/TiO2 heterojunction, favour the formation of large CuOx deposits, with relatively low amount of metallic copper and detrimental effects on photoactivity [22]. Recently, hybrid TiO2 based materials modified with both Cu and Pt were found to photogenerate H2 with higher efficiency with respect to the monometallic counterparts [23]. In general, bimetallic Cu-Pt co-catalysts were synthetized with the aim of obtaining alloys, and also to exploit their plasmonic activation under visible light irradiation and aerobic oxidation conditions [24]. In the present work we explore the effects that pre-grafting TiO2 with different amounts of Cu(II), followed by Pt NPs deposition, has on its photoactivity in hydrogen production. Mild deposition conditions were employed, with the two metal precursors being contacted with the TiO2 powders in subsequent steps and no high temperature treatment, aiming at avoiding possible metal alloying and/or doping within the TiO2 lattice. A thorough X-ray absorption analysis, providing information on the oxidation state of the two metals and on the metal–metal and metal-TiO2 interactions for different Cu/Pt ratios, and EPR analysis, evidencing electron transfer phenomena occurring under irradiation, were employed for the interpretation of the synergistic effects in photoactivity obtained in H2 production from methanol/water vapour mixtures with our Pt/Cu-modified TiO2 materials."
1,Experimental section,
2,Photocatalysts preparation,"2.1 Photocatalysts preparation All photocatalysts were prepared starting from Evonik P25 TiO2, directly employed as supplied. Pt/Cu/TiO2 materials were prepared by grafting Cu(II) metal ions on the TiO2 surface (step A), followed by Pt NPs deposition (step B). Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was the Cu(II) source in the first step. In a typical grafting procedure, 2g of P25 TiO2 powder were dispersed in 20mL of water and sonicated for 10min in a FALC LBS2 4.5L bath. Then a proper amount of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in 1.0mL of water and mixed with the aqueous TiO2 suspension in a vial. The mixture was heated at 90°C for 1h under stirring, up to complete solvent removal. The so obtained materials were then dried at 110°C for 24h and ground into fine powders using an agate mortar. They were labelled as Cu(X)/T, with X corresponding to the nominal Cu/TiO2 ratio, ranging from 0.05 to 0.5wt.%. In the second step such samples were further surface modified by deposition of a fixed amount (0.5wt.%) of Pt NPs according to a modified version of the deposition-precipitation (DP) method, using urea as the precipitating agent [25]. In particular, an aliquot of a Cu(X)/T sample was suspended in water, sonicated and added to an aqueous solution containing H2PtCl6 (0.1gL−1 of Pt) and urea (0.42M). The suspension was vigorously stirred for 4h at 80°C, until pH 7.5 was reached. The slurry was then cooled down to room temperature and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, using a CL10 Thermo Scientific centrifuge. The solid product was then re-suspended in 20mL of water and platinum was reduced by addition of an aqueous NaBH4 solution in slight excess. The color of the suspension suddenly changed from white or slightly green into grey. After 20min stirring, the slurry was centrifuged and the solid recovered and washed several times with 20mL of water, until the residual content of chloride and nitrate anions in the supernatant was below 1ppm, as checked by ion chromatography. The so obtained photocatalysts were named Pt/Cu(X)/T. To check the effects induced by the employed metal deposition procedures and by the single metal or by the co-presence of Cu and Pt on the TiO2 surface, three more samples were prepared, which were labelled T, DP/Cu(0.1)/T and Pt/T. Sample T was prepared by treating P25 TiO2 according to the two above described steps, although in the absence of metal precursors. DP/Cu(0.1)/T was produced by Cu(II) grafting followed by the DP treatment (step B above) in the absence of Pt precursor. Pt/T was prepared by performing step A without the Cu(II) source, followed by Pt NPs deposition according to the DP method. The effective amounts of Cu and Pt in the prepared samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectrometry, employing a Thermo Electron ICAP 6300 apparatus after microwave digestion of the photocatalysts in a 3:1 HCl/HNO3 mixture. The expected nominal content of both metals was always confirmed by ICP analysis. For instance, in the case of Pt/Cu(0.1)/T, the Pt and Cu amounts were found to be (0.47±0.04) and (0.09±0.01) wt.%, respectively. All chemicals employed in the preparation of the materials and of all solutions were purchased from Aldrich. Water purified by a Milli-Q water system (Millipore) was used throughout."
3,Photocatalysts characterization,"2.2 Photocatalysts characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns were recorded on a Philips PW3020 powder diffractometer, by using the Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.54056Å). Quantitative phase analysis was made by the Rietveld refinement method [26], using the “Quanto” software. The average anatase and rutile crystalline size was calculated by applying the Scherrer equation, from the width of the reflections at 2θ=25.4° and 2θ=27.4°, respectively, calculated as the ratio between the peak area and the peak intensity obtained by fitting the XRPD profile with a Gaussian function. The BET specific surface area (SSA) was measured by N2 adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature on a ASAP 2020 apparatus, after out-gassing in vacuo at 150°C for at least 2h. Diffuse reflectance (R) spectra of the photocatalyst powders were recorded on a Jasco V-670 spectrophotometer equipped with a PIN-757 integrating sphere, using barium sulphate as a reference, and then converted into absorption (A) spectra (A=1–R). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and high angular annular dark field images in scanning mode (STEM-HAADF) were taken on a JEOL FS2200-FEG instrument operating at 200kV. The catalyst was dispersed in ethanol, dropped on a carbon-film coated gold grid and dried in air. In STEM and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis the spot size was 0.7nm. The 3.7.0. analysis station with the JED-2200 software from Jeol was used to process EDX spectra. X-band Continuous Wave EPR spectra were recorded on a Brucker EMX spectrometer equipped with a cylindrical cavity and operating at a 100kHz field modulation. The measurements were carried out at the liquid nitrogen temperature in quartz cells that can be connected to a conventional high-vacuum apparatus (residual pressure<10−4 mbar). The effects of UV and visible light on the EPR spectra were investigated by irradiating the sample in the EPR resonant cavity by means of a 1600W mercury arc lamp (Oriel Instruments) equipped with a IR water filter to avoid over-heating and eventually with an additional 420nm cut off filter, to exclude UV radiation. X-ray absorption spectra (XANES and EXAFS) at both the Cu K-edge (8979eV) and Pt L3-edge (11564eV) were measured in the fluorescence mode using a Silicon Drift Detector (KETEK, model AXAS-A) at the SuperXas beamline of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) synchrotron. The proper amount of powder was mixed with cellulose and pressed in pellets. Three spectra were recorded for each sample at each edge, and merged in order to increase the signal to noise ratio. Reference Cu and Pt foils placed between the second and third ionization chamber were also measured for energy calibration. Bulk PtO2, CuO, Cu2O, Cu(OH)2 and a CuTi2 alloy were employed as reference materials. All spectra were analyzed and processed using the IFFEFIT software package [27], including Athena for spectral normalization, background subtraction, k-weighting, Fourier Transformation and linear combination analysis and Artemis for spectra fitting. Simulated Cu–Cu and Cu-Ti single scattering path EXAFS spectra at the Cu K-edge were calculated using the FEFF6 code [28]. Continuous Cauchy Wavelet Transform (CCWT) of the EXAFS spectra was performed using a Matlab script released by Muñoz et al. [29]."
4,Photoactivity tests,"2.3 Photoactivity tests The activity of the photocatalyst powders in hydrogen production by methanol photosteam reforming CH3OH+H2O→CO2 +3H2 was tested in a closed recirculation laboratory scale apparatus [8]. The photocatalyst powder (14mg) was mixed with distilled water (1.2mL), deposited on 0.85–0.42mm quartz beads (3g), and dried at 70°C for 2h. The so obtained photocatalyst bed was inserted into the photoreactor consisting of a flat cylindrical Plexiglas cell, frontally closed with a Pyrex glass optical window (irradiated surface ca. 20cm2), which was connected to a closed stainless steel system. After preliminary thorough purging with nitrogen to remove any trace of oxygen, the photocatalyst bed was continuously fed, at 40mLmin−1, with a stream of N2 saturated by the vapour of a 20 vol.% methanol−water solution (methanol molar fraction x =0.10 in the liquid phase), kept at 30°C. The absolute pressure of the reactor, 1.2bar at the beginning of the runs, progressively increased during irradiation because of the accumulation of gas-phase products. During the runs, typically lasting 6h in the case of the bare T sample, the recirculating gas was automatically sampled online every 30min and injected into an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with two columns, two detectors (thermoconductivity and flame ionization), and a Ni-catalyst kit for CO and CO2 methanation. N2 was used as carrier gas. The GC response was preliminarily calibrated for H2, CO, and CO2 analysis. When testing Pt/Cu(X)/T materials, purging with N2 in the dark was required every 2h, to avoid excessive accumulation of products in the recirculating gas phase. All kinetic tests were repeated at least two times. The irradiation source, always switched on 30min prior the beginning of the run and placed 20cm from the reactor, was a xenon arc lamp (LSH302, LOT Oriel, 300W), having 40.0mWcm−2 irradiation intensity, and operative in the 350–400nm range, as measured with an optical power meter (Thorlabs PM200) equipped with a thermal power sensor (Thorlabs S302C)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Photocatalysts characterization,"3.1 Photocatalysts characterization 3.1.1 XRPD and BET analyses Identical XRPD patterns were obtained with all investigated materials [30], which demonstrates that both Cu(II) ions grafting and Pt NPs deposition did not affect the original crystalline phase composition of P25 TiO2 (84% anatase – 16% rutile), in agreement with previous reports on noble metal modified titania [8,25,31,32]. Modified samples evidenced a 22.4nm mean anatase crystallite size, which is slightly larger than that of unmodified P25 (21.0nm), possibly due to the loss of fine particles during the surface modification procedures. Similarly, the mean rutile crystallite size underwent a slight increase, i.e. being 32.1nm and 35.1nm in the case of original P25 TiO2 and modified T sample, respectively. No variation of the TiO2 lattice parameters of any Pt/Cu(X)/T sample was observed, thus confirming that both Cu and Pt were just deposited on the TiO2 surface, and not incorporated into the TiO2 matrix [22,33,34]. BET analyses did not evidence any significant change in SSA of both reference samples and Pt/Cu(X)/T materials with respect to unmodified P25 TiO2, all measured SSA ranging between 48 and 50m2 g − 1. 3.1.2 UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra Diffuse reflectance analyses indicate that Cu(II) grafting markedly enhanced the optical absorption of the materials in the visible light region. In fact, as shown in Fig. 1 a, Cu(X)/T samples show an extra absorption in the 700–800nm region, related to the Cu(II) d-d transition, and an absorption tail in the 400–500nm region, which can be ascribed to the interfacial charge transfer (IFCT) of electrons from the valence band (VB) of TiO2 to the grafted Cu(II) species [14]. The effects on the UV–vis absorption spectra induced by the subsequent Pt NPs deposition on the materials can be appreciated in Fig. 1b, where the absorption spectra of the T and Pt/T samples are also shown for comparison. Pt/Cu(X)/T materials, appearing as grey powders, exhibit a broad absorption in the whole visible region (400–800nm). However, Cu and Pt containing samples absorb in the visible region slightly less than Pt/T. By considering that ICP measurements demonstrate that Pt/T and the Pt/Cu(X)/T samples contain the same amount of Pt (i.e. 0.47±0.04wt.%), this slight absorption decrease may possibly be related to the higher reflectance of copper. Reference sample T (containing no metals) shows a slightly red-shifted absorption onset with respect to unmodified P25, compatible with the partial enlargement of the mean TiO2 crystallite size induced by the impregnation route itself, also evidenced by XRPD analysis. This confirms that the route here employed to deposit relatively low amounts of Cu(II) species on the TiO2 surface does not produce any intrinsic narrowing of the semiconductor band gap, which was observed, instead, when larger amounts of CuO nanoclusters were deposited on TiO2 by the chemisorption-calcination cycle technique [35]. 3.1.3 STEM analysis STEM-HAADF images of the Pt/Cu(0.5)/T sample, containing the largest nominal amount of grafted Cu(II), are shown in Fig. 2 . TiO2 appears in the form of NPs forming very close microaggregates, ranging from 10 to 50nm in size, consistent with XRPD analysis. Moreover, a homogeneous distribution of platinum NPs can be appreciated, with size between 1 and 3nm, appearing as bright spots deposited on TiO2, due to the different Z-contrast of the noble metal with respect to the TiO2 support. Cu species in the form of nanoaggregates cannot be distinguished, possibly because of the lower Z-contrast in comparison with that of platinum with respect to the predominant titanium in the TiO2 matrix [22]. However, EDX analysis confirmed the presence of Cu both far and close to Pt NPs (Fig. 2d), which is compatible with the formation of small Cu clusters homogeneously anchored on the TiO2 surface."
7,XAS analysis,"3.2 XAS analysis The normalized X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra at the Pt L3-edge of selected Pt/Cu(X)/T samples shown in Fig. 3 A display an intense whiteline above the Pt L3-edge at an energy of 11.564 keV, which is intermediate between those of the reference Pt foil and bulk α-PtO2. Thus, in all Pt/Cu(X)/T samples platinum is present in both metallic and oxidized state. The linear combination analysis of the spectra obtained with different samples, performed on the basis of the XANES spectra obtained with reference samples, shows that Cu(II) pre-grafting of the TiO2 surface affects the percent amount of reduced Pt, as reported in Table 1 . In particular, while ca. 73wt.% of Pt is present in metallic state in Pt/T, Pt/Cu(0.1)/T contains the highest percent amount of metallic Pt (ca. 89wt.%), which is much lower in the other two Pt- and Cu-containing samples, with the percent amount of oxidized Pt increasing with the amount of pre-grafted Cu(II) species. The FT-EXAFS spectra at the Pt L3-edge of the investigated samples (Fig. 3C) show the presence of two signals centered at an interatomic distance R of ca. 1.6Å and 2.5Å, corresponding to the first Pt-O and Pt–Pt in metallic Pt coordination shells, respectively. In all spectra the second Pt-(O)-Pt coordination shell of PtO2 at ca. R =3.2Å can hardly be distinguished. Moreover, the fitting of these FT-EXAFS spectra (Table 2 ) shows that i) the coordination number of the Pt-O shells are much lower than that of bulk PtO2 (ca. 2 vs. 6, respectively), and ii) both the coordination number and the interatomic distance of the Pt–Pt shells of the metallic particles decrease with increasing amount of pre-grafted Cu(II). These results suggest that the Pt NPs consist of an oxidized surface layer covering a metallic core and that the size of Pt NPs is influenced by the copper content, decreasing with increasing Cu(II) pre-grafted on TiO2. This would explain the increase of Pt(IV) fraction with increasing copper content, as a higher fraction of oxidized surface Pt atoms is expected when Pt NPs are smaller and thus more highly dispersed on the TiO2 surface. The XANES spectra of the same samples at the Cu K-edge (Fig. 3B) together with their linear combination analysis (Table 1) show that in Pt/Cu(0.1)/T copper is predominantly in zero-valent form (73% Cu(0) and 27% Cu(II)), in Pt/Cu(0.3)/T it consists of a mixture of Cu(I) (19%) and Cu(II) (79%), while in Pt/Cu(0.5)/T the Cu(II) form largely prevails (97%). However, the shape of the XANES spectra shown in Fig. 3B significantly differs from those of both Cu foil and bulk CuO. In particular, the XANES spectra of both Pt/Cu(0.3)/T and Pt/Cu(0.5)/T are more similar to that of Cu(OH)2. By considering that the shape of the XANES spectrum is affected, besides by the oxidation state, also by the chemical environment surrounding the absorber atom, this fact suggests that in such samples the coordination structure of Cu(II) is different with respect to that of CuO. Irie, et al. [14] also found that the XANES spectra of their 0.27%Cu-grafted/TiO2 sample resembled that of Cu(OH)2 and attributed this to a distorted CuO structure, where Cu(II) ions are coordinated with 5 oxygen atoms in a square pyramidal form, as in the case of Cu(OH)2, rather than in the four-coordinated square planar form of crystalline CuO. By contrast, the XANES spectrum of Pt/Cu(0.1)/T differs from that of the Cu foil and it mainly resembles that of the Cu-Ti alloy (Fig. 3B). In order to prove the presence of Ti in the coordination environment of Cu, the Continuous Cauchy Wavelet Transform (CCWT) was applied, which is able to distinguish neighboring atoms of different chemical nature but located at very similar interatomic distance R. In fact, even if originating similar FT-EXAFS spectra, the difference in the original χ(k) spectrum is highlighted by the presence in the CCWT contour graph of a trace that can be located in a different k range along the x-axis but centered at the same R along the ordinate axis. As shown in Fig. 4 , the CCWT of the XAS spectra of both the simulated Cu–Cu scattering path (R =2.5576Å and σ2 =0.003Å2) and the Cu foil generate a trace in the contour graph with a maximum located in the 6Å−1 < k< 8Å−1 wavenumber range. By contrast, the maxima of the simulated Cu-Ti scattering path (R =2.6399Å and σ2 =0.003Å2) of the Cu-Ti alloy and of Pt/Cu(0.1)/T are all located at lower k values (5Å−1 < k< 7Å−1). Hence, the CCWT analysis demonstrates the presence of Ti atoms in the coordination environment of Cu in Pt/Cu(0.1)/T. However, the formation of a Cu-Ti alloy should be excluded, by considering the here employed mild preparation conditions. On the other hand, the smaller average coordination number (CN) of the Cu–Cu shell obtained for Pt/Cu(0.1)/T with respect to the Cu foil (6 vs. 12) suggests that Cu is present as small aggregates of few atoms on the TiO2 surface, with Cu atoms at the bottom of such clusters tightly coordinated to surface Ti atoms (Table 3 ). XAS results thus suggest that during the grafting step Cu(II) species very likely adsorb on specific TiO2 surface sites, creating clusters which are progressively larger with increasing Cu(II) amount. These Cu(II) agglomerates, homogeneously distributed on the TiO2 surface, may be reduced to metal Cu during the treatment with NaBH4 and then re-oxidized after exposure to air. However, in the low Cu-containing Pt/Cu(0.1)/T sample the small Cu clusters coordinate with surface Ti atoms forming a peculiar surface structure which stabilizes the metallic form of grafted copper."
8,EPR analysis,"3.3 EPR analysis 3.3.1 Investigation under dark conditions EPR spectra of both Cu(X)/T and Pt/Cu(X)/T samples (with X=0.1 and 0.5), recorded under vacuum and at liquid nitrogen temperature, are shown in Fig. 5 . In the spectrum of bare P25 TiO2, also included for comparison in Fig. 5 (line a), a tiny signal amenable to trace of Ti3+ centres can be observed [36,37], which is typically originated from the intrinsic defects of the P25 material and is well documented in the literature [38,39]. All Cu(II) grafted samples (spectra b-e in Fig. 5) show a complex EPR signal, which is the fingerprint of Cu2+ species, the presence of which in different relative amount confirms the results of EXAFS analysis. Cu2+ is a 3d9 ion (S=1/2) with a non zero nuclear spin (63Cu natural abundance 69.09% and 65Cu natural abundance 30.91%, I=3/2). Its EPR features (g and hyperfine A tensors) are correlated to the d orbitals splitting and to the ground state of the cation, which in turn strictly depends on its geometrical and chemical environment. A 3d9 ion such as Cu2+ undergoes Jan-Teller effect and is therefore usually found in axially distorted coordination. The expected g tensor for an isolated Cu2+ ion in axially distorted octahedral symmetry is based on a parallel component (g// ) higher than the free electron value (g// = gz >ge ) and characterized by a well-defined quartet of hyperfine lines (multiplicity 2 I+1=4) having a typical A// splitting. In the case of surface supported ions, the perpendicular g component (g⊥ , being g// > g⊥ > ge ) often shows an unresolved hyperfine splitting due to the small value of this component (A⊥ << A// ). For example, in the case of surface Cu(II) species on TiO2, g tensors with g// =2.44-2.32 and g⊥ =2.007-2.005 and A// hyperfine coupling in the range 100–160G are reported [40–42]. Instead, for isolated Cu(II) ions, possibly incorporated into a TiO2 matrix, similar g factors were found but with hyperfine coupling constant of about 80–90G [43,44]. The presence of totally unresolved signals is usually associated to strongly interacting (not isolated) Cu2+ centres [44]. In our case, all EPR spectra reported in Fig. 5 (lines b–e) are due to Cu2+ ions and can be interpreted as the overlap between a family of interacting sites, originating a broad and asymmetric EPR signal, and one or more families of isolated cupric ions, producing a hyperfine structure resolved in the parallel component (A// ). The materials containing 0.1wt.% of Cu originate an EPR signal with g // ∼2.29, A// =156G and an unresolved perpendicular region, thus showing a relative low content of isolated Cu(II) ions, the typical hyperfine structure of which is barely visible (Fig. 5b,c). Differently, in the case of higher Cu loading (i.e., 0.5wt.%), isolated cupric ions are more abundant and distinct families of such ions can be distinguished on the basis of the parallel component characterized by g // =2.44 and A// ∼90G (Fig. 5d) or by g // ∼2.36 with hyperfine coupling A// ranging from ∼90G to ∼105G (Fig. 5e). Pt/Cu(0.5)/T exhibits the better resolved EPR hyperfine structure. The presence of a broad and featureless component is commonly observed in materials containing surface Cu2+ ions and can be explained by invoking both dipolar broadening and the presence of strong g strain. The first effect is due to the presence of clustered and interacting paramagnetic centres, while the second is related to the presence of a marked heterogeneity of coordination sites. Whatever the origin of such spectral feature, the obtained EPR signals (Fig. 5b,c) clearly indicate that in both Cu(0.1)/T and Pt/Cu(0.1)/T a fraction of grafted Cu(II) ions covers disordered regions, as amorphous areas of the material. The EPR spectrum of a Cu(0.1)/T was recorded under oxygen atmosphere at liquid nitrogen temperature. In such conditions the dipolar interaction between the paramagnetic oxygen molecules in the physisorbed layer and the paramagnetic species present at the surface of the solid (Cu2+, in this case) cause the spectrum of the latter species to vanish while the other centres (subsurface or bulk) are unaffected by this interaction. The EPR spectrum of Cu(0.1)/T acquired in the presence of physisorbed oxygen (Fig. 6 , grey line) shows i) a decrease of the overall signal intensity, ii) a net decrease of the hyperfine structure corresponding to the isolated species dominating the spectrum under vacuum (g // =2.29, A// =156) which must be, therefore, a surface exposed species and iii) the appearance of a new structure with four hyperfine lines (g // ∼2.36 and A// ∼90G) which was buried in the spectrum recorded under vacuum (Fig. 6, black line) and that shows up only when the surface species is depressed by interaction with oxygen. This new species also observed for Cu(0.5)/T under vacuum conditions (Fig. 5d), corresponds to an isolated Cu(II) species, present also in the case of Cu(0.1)/T, and located under the surface. EPR measurements thus demonstrate the presence of 2–3 families of isolated Cu2+ ions in all investigated samples, which are either exposed at the TiO2 surface or entrapped on less exposed surface layers, together with more aggregated and ill-defined Cu2+ species in mutual dipolar interaction, which are the large majority of cupric ions grafted on TiO2. The ratio between the two families of Cu(II) centres cannot be evaluated, due to the complexity of the EPR spectra. However, the EPR signal change observed in the presence of O2 suggests that the aggregated Cu(II) centres originating a broad EPR signal are mainly distributed on the TiO2 surface, while the majority of isolated Cu(II) ions are less prone to interact with physisorbed O2 (and thus show a lower surface character). 3.3.2 Investigation under irradiation The effects on the EPR response of Cu(0.1)/T and Pt/Cu(0.1)/T induced by irradiation with visible or UV–vis light were also studied. The intensity, obtained via double integration of the EPR spectra, of the signals acquired under vis or UV–vis irradiation, normalized with respect to that obtained in the dark, are reported in Fig. 7 . All spectra were recorded at liquid nitrogen temperature under vacuum conditions. For both materials irradiation produces an overall decrease of the EPR signal associated to Cu2+ species, which is more pronounced when light also included the UV component. The partial disappearance of the surface Cu2+ signal upon visible light irradiation (λ>420nm) is consistent with the expected activation of IFCT in such kind of Cu(II) grafted TiO2 materials, i.e. electrons in the VB of TiO2 are directly transferred to the discrete energy levels of Cu(II) ions and form EPR silent Cu(I), with positive holes remaining in the VB of TiO2. Moreover, the fact that with Pt/Cu(0.1)/T the Cu2+ signal decrease attained upon visible light irradiation is lower than that observed in the case of Cu(0.1)/T is compatible with an interaction occurring between Cu and Pt, allowing back electron transfer from the photogenerated Cu(I) species to Pt NPs, with the subsequent restoring of Cu(II) species. The larger Cu2+ intensity drop observed for both photocatalysts upon UV–vis irradiation with respect to visible light irradiation may be reasonably ascribed to the fact that under such conditions electron transfer from the VB of TiO2 to Cu(II) may also proceed through TiO2 band gap excitation followed by electron transfer from the TiO2 CB to grafted Cu(II), in addition to the above mentioned IFCT mechanism. Moreover, grafted Cu(II) ions are expected to better survive in the presence of surface Pt NPs, which may directly scavenge the electrons photopromoted into the TiO2 CB, a process in competition with electron transfer to Cu2+ species, as supported by the EPR experiments reported in Fig. 7. When similar experiments were performed in the presence of adsorbed oxygen the Cu2+ EPR intensity underwent only very minor decrease under irradiation. This demonstrates that photopromoted electrons preferentially react with O2, a powerful electron scavenger, and are consequently less likely transferred to Pt nanoparticles or to Cu(II) grafted species. Also Nosaka et al. [41] observed no significant decrease of the Cu2+ EPR signal in the presence of O2 under visible light and suggested that the eventually formed Cu+ species may efficiently reduce O2 molecules to form O2 − or H2O2 via a catalytic multielectron process, thus returning to original Cu2+."
9,Photocatalytic activity,"3.4 Photocatalytic activity In the photocatalytic steam reforming reaction, hydrogen production is paralleled by methanol oxidation up to CO2 through the formation of formaldehyde and formic acid as intermediate species; carbon monoxide and other minor side products are also produced [8]. In all photocatalytic tests H2, CO2 and CO evolution occurred at constant rate under full lamp irradiation, as in previous studies [8,45,46], whereas no hydrogen production was observed under visible light irradiation (λirr >420nm). Some examples of photocatalytic hydrogen production vs. irradiation time are shown in Fig. 8 . The rate of H2 production, r H2, and the percent selectivity to CO, S CO, obtained with the here investigated photocatalysts are reported in Fig. 9 , together with those obtained with reference naked TiO2 (sampleT) or reference samples obtained from P25 TiO2 either by Cu grafting followed by reduction with NaBH4 (DP/Cu(0.1)/T), or by Pt deposition (Pt/T). The r H2 values obtained with the Cu(X)/T photocatalysts series are all around 0.8mmolh−1 gcat −1 (not shown in Fig. 9), i.e. only slightly higher than that measured with reference T. The rates of hydrogen production obtained with all photocatalysts of the Pt/Cu(X)/T series are the highest values ever measured within our laboratory scale recirculation photocatalytic system. They are higher than those obtained with photocatalysts prepared by Pt NPs deposition on TiO2, or synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis [8], and also with flame-made fluorinated Pt/TiO2 [47]. Moreover, a volcano-shaped photoactivity trend was obtained with increasing Cu content in the Pt/Cu(X)/T photocatalyst series (Fig. 9), the maximum rate of hydrogen production (27.2mmolh−1 gcat −1) being attained with Pt/Cu(0.1)/T, containing 0.1wt.% of copper. The r H2 value attained with this photocatalyst is higher than the sum of those obtained with DP/Cu(0.1)/T (4.5mmolh−1 gcat −1) or Pt/T (16.1mmolh−1 gcat −1). This highlights a very intriguing synergistic effect induced on photocatalytic hydrogen production by the co-presence of grafted Cu and Pt NPs on the TiO2 surface. Furthermore, Cu(II) pre-grafting on TiO2 followed by Pt NPs deposition also affected the distribution of methanol oxidation products. In fact, as shown in Fig. 9, with all Pt/Cu(X)/T samples a significant drop in selectivity to CO was obtained, S CO passing from 7.8% and 10% for Pt/T and DP/Cu(0.1)/T to 3.8% for best performing Pt/Cu(0.1)/T, while the selectivity to CO2 with all Pt/Cu(X)/T photocatalysts remained almost constant, in the 37–41% range. The lower S CO obtained with our Cu pre-grafted Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts makes them very interesting in the perspective of directly feeding fuel cells with the hydrogen produced by photocatalytic steam reforming, because problems related to the undesired poisoning of Pt-Pd based catalysts of fuel cells would be mitigated. The origin of the very high hydrogen production rate and of the synergistic effect on TiO2 photoactivity induced by pre-grafting low amounts of Cu(II) species on the titania surface, followed by Pt NPs deposition and chemical reduction, may be explained in relation to the oxidation state and local surroundings of the two metals on the TiO2 surface. We notice, in fact, that the treatment of the Cu grafted TiO2 with NaBH4, required to reduce platinum in Pt NPs, has beneficial effects on photoactivity. Indeed, the rate of hydrogen production obtained with reference DP/Cu(0.1)/T is much higher than that (0.8mmolh−1 gcat −1) obtained with the photocatalysts of the Cu(X)/T series. On the other hand, the higher activity of Pt/Cu(X)/T photocatalysts with respect to bare (T) or Cu-modified DP/Cu(X)/T (see Fig. 9) can be easily related to the positive role of the noble metal, acting as trap of CB electrons, with a Schottky barrier formation and a consequently more efficient electron-hole separation [8]. During our photocatalytic steam reforming tests performed under anaerobic conditions the simultaneous charge transfer processes depicted in Scheme 1 may occur. Cu(II) ions in the pre-grafted Cu species can accept the electrons photopromoted to the TiO2 CB under UV irradiation (path (a), blue arrow in Scheme 1), with an increase in electron-hole separation. At the same time, as suggested by Irie et al. [14,41,48], Cu(II) ions may directly accept electrons from the VB of TiO2 by interfacial charge transfer (IFCT), which may occur also under visible light irradiation (see path (b), red arrow in Scheme 1). Indeed, our EPR analysis demonstrates that the amount of Cu2+ species decreases under irradiation, and that such decrease under UV irradiation is larger than under visible light, when only IFCT is possible (see Fig. 7). This confirms that both TiO2 band gap excitation and IFCT activation are at work with copper-containing photocatalysts. Both of them produce holes in the VB of TiO2, favoring the full oxidation of methanol up to CO2, with a consequent decrease of selectivity to CO. The best photocatalytic performance was attained with Pt/Cu(0.1)/T, on which, as evidenced by EXAFS analysis, small CuO aggregates, intimately coordinated with Ti surface atoms, may coexist with metallic Cu, probably localized at the CuO − TiO2 interface (see Table 1), which may favour all electron transfer paths. Indeed, low amounts of Ni(0), acting as ohmic contact at the interface between NiO nanoclusters and TiO2, were recently found to play a role in increasing H2 photocatalytic production from aqueous methanol solutions employing TiO2 photocatalysts containing both Ni and Au [13]. On the other hand, photoinduced electron transfer to grafted Cu(II) may also lead to the in situ formation of metallic Cu, which can act as an efficient co-catalyst [15,16]. However, no induction period in H2 production was observed at the beginning of our photocatalytic tests, which was instead observed by others [49] and attributed to Cu(II) photoinduced reduction to Cu(0). In fact, as shown in Fig. 8, three consecutive 2 h-long kinetic runs carried out with Pt/Cu(0.1)/T and Pt/Cu(0.5)/T demonstrate reproducible H2 production, linearly increasing with time. The slight photoactivity decrease observed in the Pt/Cu(X)/T series with increasing Cu loading (Fig. 9) may originate from the progressive enlargement of copper oxide deposits on the TiO2 surface (as pointed out by EXAFS analysis in Section 3.2), more abundant and larger CuO clusters being expected to have weaker interaction with the TiO2 surface [22,50]. At the same time the increase of Cu2+ component with increasing grafted copper content (see Table 1) may decrease its ability to generate hydrogen, in line with recent literature results [22]. Of course, the oxidation state of copper grafted onto TiO2 may easily change, either during the photocatalyst treatment with NaBH4 required to reduce Pt NPs, or by O2 upon exposure to air leading to the formation of Cu2O or CuO (CuxO) nanoclusters, besides during irradiation under anaerobic conditions (see EPR results in Fig. 7). If CuxO nanoclusters become crystalline e.g. by post-deposition thermal treatment, they behave as semiconductors with band gap energy ranging from 1.4 to 2.6eV, depending on their size [51]. The so formed p-n heterojunction between TiO2 and CuxO may contribute in increasing photoproduced charge carriers separation. In fact, under UV–vis light irradiation photopromoted electrons can be transferred from the CB of TiO2 to the CB of CuO [18], which are located at −0.16 and +0.16V vs. NHE (pH 0), respectively, while photogenerated holes might be trapped within the TiO2 particles [34,52–54]. On the other hand, the simultaneous activation of TiO2 and CuO under UV–vis irradiation may produce an accumulation of electrons in the CB of CuO, with a consequent shift of the Fermi level of CuO towards a more negative potential [55], i.e. more negative than the H+/H2 redox couple. By this way enough overvoltage would be attained to drive efficient H2 evolution, likely occurring on Pt NPs, from CuO modified TiO2 photocatalysts (see Scheme 1), thus accounting for beneficial Cu-Pt synergistic effects."
10,Conclusions,"This work highlights the beneficial effects induced by Cu(II) pre-grafting on the activity of Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts in H2 production from methanol/water vapour mixtures up to unprecedentedly high H2 production rates measured with our laboratory scale photocatalytic system. The highest photoactivity was obtained with a TiO2-based photocatalyst containing 0.1wt.% of copper, in which CuO nanoclusters appear to be intimately coordinated with surface Ti atoms in a surface structure that partially stabilizes pre-grafted copper in metallic form, possibly acting as an electron-transfer bridge at the interface between CuO nanoclusters and TiO2, facilitating electron-hole separation. Synergistic effects on photoactivity in hydrogen production are thus induced by the co-presence of Cu nanoclusters obtained through mild grafting and Pt NPs on the TiO2 surface. The so obtained Cu nanoclusters guarantee a proper switching of the copper oxidation state under UV–vis irradiation, which facilitates electron transfer to adsorbed protons."
