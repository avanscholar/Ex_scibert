0,Introduction,"The rapid depletion of fossil fuel reserves resources has made the fuel industry on priority to explore renewable, alternative, and sustainable resources for the generation of transportation fuel and chemicals [1,2]. At the same time, alternate resources should also maintain a carbon–neutral cycle in the environment to avoid global warming as well as pollution due to COx, SOx, and NOx based pollutants [3]. For the stringent safety measures, biomass could be considered as a reliable solution [4]. In addition to that, biomass is found to be an abundant, inexpensive, and renewable resource for future energy production. Though a large quantity of bio-oil could be achieved from biomass, it has the disadvantage of high oxygen content in the oil, which makes it highly viscous and incompatible with conventional fuels [5]. Hence, its practical application as direct fuel and fuel additive in transportation vehicles are limited [1]. In addition, many chemical and thermo chemical methods have been developed to eradicate oxygen atom successfully. Among them, deoxygenation via catalytic hydrogenation pathway is one of the new methods and ensures considerable removal of an oxygen atom with an increase of energy density [6,7]. Recently, research on catalytic dehydration and photocatalytic oxidation of cellulose and hemicellulose biomass has received great attention for the production of dihydroxy methyl furfural, hydroxymethyl furfural and furancarboxylic acid based bio-oils [8–10]. Catalytic hydrogenation of these bio-oils gives rise to the generation of 2, 5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and methyl furan (MF). These compounds are considered as attractive bio-based platform chemicals for renewable production of biofuel and chemical feedstock [11,12]. In addition to that, the high octane number and high energy density of these compounds make it possible for the usage as fuel additive with gasoline also. Further, furfural can be converted into furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfural alcohol, and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran through hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, respectively, which can be utilized as a raw material for the pharmaceutical and polymer industry [13,14]. MF could be obtained through hydrodeoxygenation of FUR, which is considered as a highly promising, alternative liquid fuel. MF has a higher octane number than gasoline (103 vs. 96.8 RON), and higher energy densities (28.5 MJ L-1 vs. 31.9 MJ L-1). It is clear that MF possesses 34% higher energy than the same volume of ethanol as a biofuel [15]. Many noble metals such as Pt, Pd-Re, Ru, and Ir have been investigated for the production of methyl furan from furfural through hydrogenation due to their excellent catalytic activity and selectivity [16–19]. However, considering its high cost and scarcity of noble metals, considerable efforts have been initiated to develop non-noble metal catalysts recently. To overcome this, tremendous efforts have been brought about to develop non-noble metal based catalysts. Recently, cost-effective Cu and Ni base metals bimetallic catalysts have been explored as effective catalysts for hydrogenation of furfural and 5‑Formyloxymethylfurfural to obtain fuel range compounds and value-added chemicals [20,21]. The reported results suggest that catalytic activity and selectivity of bimetallic NiCu could be improved synergistically due to its bifunctional effects. However, the high Ni loading result in a decrease in methyl furan selectivity in the bimetallic NiCu catalyst supported on SiO2 and SBA-15 [21,22]. Many clay minerals such as montmorillonite, laponite, and fluorohectorite belong to the smectite group. Hydrocracking of heavy oil and diesel has been studied on NiMo catalyst supported on modified bentonite clay and activated red mud materials [23,24]. The clays are generally layered silicates with a sandwich structure of tetrahedral silica units. Among them, Laponite is a unique synthetic, trioctahedral hectorite clay that contains two tetrahedral silica sheets and a central octahedral magnesia sheets with dimensions of 1 nm thickness and ~25 nm average diameter [25]. Interestingly, Laponite clay particles tend to polydisperse and undergo delamination when it is modified with cationic and neutral surfactants. This kind of modification of clay minerals has resulted in increased surface area and pore size [7,26]. Hence, such modification on Laponite will generate properties similar to ordered mesoporous materials such as MCM and the SBA family of materials. [27–29]. This unique Laponite clay can be very well-tuned to get desired textural property and surface morphology by adopting suitable synthesis conditions. The authors have reported the procedure to modify Laponite clay by using dodecylamine (DDA) as co-surfactant at room temperature and Tergitol (15-S-9) as surfactant under hydrothermal conditions [7,30,31]. In the present work, the uniqueness of laponite clay is exploited for its use as support for non noble Ni-Cu metals and effective and selective hydrogenation of furfural to biofuel. Thus, in this study, a series of NiCu with different % of Cu loading (8, 10, 12 & 14%) supported on Laponite synthesised under hydrothermal conditions were prepared by adopting a simple wet-impregnation method. The testing of all the catalysts was performed on the hydrogenation of furfural under reduced hydrogen pressure. A comparison of the catalytic activity of all the catalysts is made, and the structural activity relationship of the catalysts is discussed in detail."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Raw Laponite RD clay was obtained from Rockwood Additives Pvt. Ltd. Furfural (99%) and Tergitol surfactant (15-S-9) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich China Co. Ltd. Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, and other chemicals were purchased from Merck and used without further purification."
3,Synthesis of modified Laponite support and NiCu supported catalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of modified Laponite support and NiCu supported catalyst Modified Laponite was synthesized from Laponite with Tergitol surfactant (Laponite: Tergitol) (1:5 wt%) by using our previously reported method [7]. The mixed metal catalysts were prepared by a simple co-impregnation method using Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O precursors for Cu and Ni, respectively. Different wt.% of Cu (8, 10, 12 and 14) were loaded on the Laponite support with constant 5 wt% loading of Ni. The obtained slurry was aged in a hot oven at 120 °C for 4 h. Subsequently, the dried samples were calcined at 550 °C for 5 h. The obtained catalysts were designated as 5% Ni-x% Cu/Laponite, where x is 8, 10, 12, and 14."
4,Characterization of synthesized catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of synthesized catalysts X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were recorded using Bruker D8 diffractometer with Ni filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Data were collected in the 2θ range between 10° and 80° with a step size of 0.02° min−1. BET surface area (SBET), pore size (Dp), and pore volume of the Ni and Cu supported catalysts were measured using BELSORP mini surface area analyzer. The pore size distribution curves were obtained from the desorption branch of the isotherm. Specific surface area and pore size data were measured by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at a liquid nitrogen temperature (−196 °C) on the Belsorp mini surface area analyzer (Belsorp, Japan). The catalysts were degassed in a vacuum at 373 K for 4 h before the analysis. Pore size distribution was calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherm using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. Temperature-programmed reduction/desorption was measured using (H2-TPR) and was carried out on a Micromeritics AutoChem II Chemisorption Analyzer with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The catalysts were reduced using 5% H2/Ar mixture at a flow rate of 80 ml/min by the heating rate at 10 °C/min up to 800 °C. The reducibility of the calcined samples was determined by H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR). For carrying out these measurements, exactly 0.05 g of the sample was taken in a U shaped quartz tube and heated at 300 °C under a He flow of 80 ml/min, and held at this temperature for 3 h. The reactor was then cooled down to 50 °C, and the sample were exposed to a stream of 80 ml/min of 10% H2/Ar. Subsequently, the sample was heated up to 1000 °C at a heating rate of 15 °C/min. The amount of hydrogen consumed during measurement as a function of temperature was monitored on-line on a TCD detector. The surface morphology of catalysts was analyzed using high-resolution Scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM), SUPRA55, and high-resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), SUPRA55. The percentage of metal was determined using a Shimadzu ICPS-7500 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was carried out on a SUPRA55 operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The average size of Laponite and NiCu oxide dots were observed and calculated using image J software."
5,Catalytic reaction and analysis of data,"2.4 Catalytic reaction and analysis of data Hydrogenation of furfural was carried out in a high pressure, sealed type 100 ml batch reactor fabricated by Amar Equip. Pvt. Ltd. Mumbai, India. The reaction conditions such as stirring speed, temperature, and pressure can be viewed and controlled. The reaction was performed by charging 100 mg of reduced NiCu/Laponite catalysts in 5 wt% furfural by using isopropanol as a solvent (20 ml) into a 100 ml SS vessel with a magnetic stirrer. The vessel was then pressurized (10 bar) three times with nitrogen to remove air. The hydrogenation reaction was tested at a different temperature range between 150 °C and 210 °C for 6 h under a stirring speed of 600 rpm. After the completion of every reaction, the reaction was quenched by cooling down the vessel immediately to room temperature with water circulating chillier (5–10 °C). The reaction mixture was collected every one hour and subjected to product analysis. The recyclability study was carried out up to three cycles by collecting the catalyst under centrifugation and washed with IPA for 3 times, and the solid catalyst was directly added to the vessel for the next run. The collected liquid products were analyzed with Shimadzu 17A gas chromatography attached with a flame ionization detector (FID). The conversion and selectivity of furfural, Specific Reaction Rate (SRR), and TOF of the catalysts were determined by using the following relations. (1) F u r f u r a l C o n v e r s i o n ( X A ) ( % ) = M o l es of i n i t i a l f u r f u a l - M o l e s o f r e a c t e d f u r f u r a l M o l e s o f i n i t i a l f u r f u r a l × 100 (2) P r o d u c t Y i e l d % = M o l e s o f p r o d u c t f o r m e d M o l e s o f i n i t i a l f u r f u r a l × 100 The specific reaction rate (SRR) was calculated by using the following relations (3–4) (3) k = - l n ( 1 - X A ) / t (4) r s = k C AO / w where rs is termed as specific reaction rate expressed in mol g−1 s−1, XA is total conversion, CA0 is the initial concentration of reactant in mol L−1, k is rate constant, t is time, CA is the concentration of product in mol L−1, and w is the weight of the catalyst in g. Turnover frequency is calculated from the following relation (4) [32]. (5) T u r n o v e r F r e q u e n c y ( T O F ) [ s - 1 ] = S p e c i f i c r e a c t i o n r a t e [ r s , m o l g - 1 s - 1 ] Q u a n t i t y o f s i t e s [ μ , m o l g - 1 ] where the number of sites (mol/g) calculated from the H2-chemisorption study."
6,Results & discussion,
7,XRD,"3.1 XRD XRD pattern of the synthesized catalysts was recorded to identify the crystalline nature of NiO and CuO on the Laponite support and depicted in Fig. 1 . The broad peak observed at 2θ value of 19.6° is due to amorphous tetrahedral silica in the framework of the Laponite clay. The peaks observed on all the catalysts at 2θ value of 19.6°, 28.4°, 35.9°, 60.8°, 72.5° are indexed to the planes (020), (004), (200) and (060) of raw Laponite RD [33,34]. The characteristics of Laponite RD were retained in all the catalysts confirming the structural integrity of Laponite RD clay. The diffraction peaks observed at 35.6°, 39.0°, 49.0° and 75.3° were assigned to (002), (111), (112) and (004) planes of copper oxide [35] while that observed at 37.2°, 43.7°, and 61.8° are indexed to the planes of (111), (200) and (220) of cubic NiO species (oxide phases of nickel) [20]. The less intense peaks corresponding to CuO, NiO, and NiCu were seen only on 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite due to fine dispersion of CuO and NiO on the support, as reported elsewhere [36]. The crystallite size of Cu oxide of all the catalysts was calculated and presented in Table 1 . The results revealed that with increasing Cu wt.%, there is a considerable decrease in crystallite size."
8,N2 Sorption analysis,"3.2 N2 Sorption analysis From the BET isotherms of the catalysts (Fig. 2 ), it is understood that the isotherm of all the catalysts exhibited type IV isotherm with H1-type hysteresis loop [37]. Further, confirmed the structural integrity of the modified Laponite clay consisting of mesoporous structure with complex slit type pores. The textural properties of all the catalysts are displayed in Table 1. Synthesized Laponite possessed surface area, average pore volume, and pore size of 508 m2/g, 0.72 cm3/g, and 12.9 nm, respectively [7]. However, there was a reduction in the surface area and pore size value of the catalysts on loading Ni and Cu. The values measured were in the range of 301–380 m2/g and 5.8–6.3 nm, respectively. It was evident from the textural properties of catalysts (Table 1) that surface area and pore volume decreased with an increased percentage of Cu loading due to surface and pore filling of the modified Laponite by Ni and Cu metal oxides during impregnation. The pore size distribution of all the catalysts is displayed in the inset of Fig. 2B, which was estimated by the BJH method obtained from desorption branch of the isotherm. This confirms a single pore model with narrow pore distribution in the range of 5–12 nm in contrast to the modified Laponite, which contains bimodal pore size distribution with wide pores in the range of 6 to 28 nm [7]."
9,H2-TPR study,"3.3 H2-TPR study The as-synthesized series of 5 %NiO-x% CuO/Laponite catalysts (where x = 8, 10, 12, 14 wt%) were subjected to H2-TPR analysis to understand the extent of reduction of metal oxide species on the Laponite support (Fig. 3 ). A broad reduction peak at low temperature region between 400 °C and 580 °C due to complete reduction of Cu (II) to Cu (0) and the reduction peak between 580 and 900 °C due to complete reduction of Ni species on the support were observed on all the catalysts [38]. The reduction peak at the low-temperature region could be corresponding to the reduction of weakly bound CuO species [39], while the reduction peaks observed in the high-temperature region are due to the reduction of strongly bound NiO species with the support [7,30]. It is observed from the TPR profiles, that there is a shift in peak maximum towards low temperature with an increase in the percentage of copper content resulting in a single very broad peak. This fact alone suggests a probable synergistic interaction between bimetallic Ni and Cu species on the laponite support."
10,NH3-TPD study,"3.4 NH3-TPD study The surface acidity of all the 5Ni-xCu/Laponite catalysts (where x = 8, 10, 12 & 14) was measured with the aid of the NH3-TPD technique, and the TPD profile is presented in Fig. 4 and the results in Table 2 . Generally, the solid acid materials tend to exhibit two types of surface Acid sites in different temperature regions at which adsorbed gaseous NH3 tend to desorb. The weak acid sites are observed between 100 °C-350 °C, whereas strong acid sites are seen above 350 °C [40]. The bimetallic Cu-Ni catalysts supported on Laponite showed total acidity value in the range of 0.6–1.1 mmol/g (Table 1). The desorption profiles of 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite was observed to be very broad and then de-convoluted into three peaks at different temperature region. The peaks around 300 °C and 400 °C −590 °C can be attributed to weak and strong acidity, respectively. Also, the NH3-TPD profile illustrated that the peak intensity increased with an increase in copper content due to an increased surface acidity. Among these materials, only NiO(5)-CuO(12)/Laponite exhibited moderate surface acidity, and surface acidity of all the catalysts followed the order 5 Ni-14Cu/Laponite > 5 Ni-12Cu/Laponite > 5 Ni-10Cu/Laponite > 5 Ni-8Cu/Laponite. The study reveals that there is a small increase in acidity associated with an increase in Cu content."
11,HRSEM and HRTEM,"3.5 HRSEM and HRTEM SEM and TEM images were recorded for investigation of the surface morphology of the synthesized catalysts and displayed in Fig. 5 . An aggregated grain like morphology was observed on NiO(5)-CuO(12)/Laponite in the form of disordered and delaminated flake sheets. The TEM image showed the delaminated sheets of Laponite along with the dispersed nanosized CuO and NiO, which were identified as random dark spots on the surface of the Laponite support with an average particle size of 10–15 nm. The delaminated sheets of Laponite particles seem to be largely aggregated grain morphology with average size distribution in the range of 100–200 nm, which was in accordance with the literature [30]. The electron microscopic images confirmed surface modification of Laponite clay (Laponite clay sheets delaminated) and dispersion of NiCu oxide on the surface of the laponite support."
12,XP spectra,"3.6 XP spectra The X-ray photoelectron spectrum of Cu (12) Ni(5) /Laponite catalyst is presented in Fig. 6 to illustrate the oxidation state and chemical environment of Ni and Cu on the Laponite support. The survey spectrum confirmed the presence of Si, Cu, and Ni, and Mg. The surface composition of CuNi/Laponite catalyst is found to be 10.7% Si, 8.6% Cu, 4.8% Ni, 2.0% Mg, and 71.9% O. A major peak corresponding to O 1s core level at 532.7 eV is due to the oxygen species in the Laponite support. Further, the O1s deconvoluted peak showed two asymmetric signals, one at 532.7 eV and another at 530.4 eV. The first peak at 532.7 is due to tetrahedral oxygen from SiO2 (Laponite) whereas, the second peak at 530.4 is associated with oxygen species from Cu and Ni metal oxides. The binding energy values for Si 2p and O 1s were similar to those of Si 2p and O 1s present in the other porous silica materials [41,42]. It is evident that the Cu 2p3/2 in the catalyst possesses a clear satellite peak and the main peak at 935.0 eV is due to the characteristics of Cu2+ [43]. Similarly, Ni 2p3/2 spectrum possesses a clear satellite peak and the main peak at 935.0 eV representing Ni2+ present on the support surface [44]."
13,DRS UV and FT IR spectra,"3.7 DRS UV and FT IR spectra The spectra of NiCu/Modified Laponite clay catalysts were recorded to study the chemical environment and the oxidation state of Ni and Cu on Laponite clay surface and displayed in Fig. 7 (A). The spectra showed that all the catalysts possess two different types of absorption bands, i.e., the lower adsorption band was observed at 240–246 nm while adsorption was due to O2– Ni2+ charge transfer [45]. A broad absorption peak maximum was observed in all the catalysts range from 330 nm to 518 nm, which is due to the copper adsorption band [46] while the adsorption band adsorbed at 745 nm is due to the presence of octahedral Ni species on the Laponite support. FT-IR spectra of calcined catalysts are displayed in Fig. 7(B). The absorption bands observed at 964 cm− 1 and 3426 cm− 1 are due to stretching vibration of surface silanol group (Si-OH) and O-H in adsorbed H2O molecules present in the Laponite support. A slight variation of the adsorption band was observed with an increasing % of Cu loading, which is due to the replacement of hydrogen atoms in silanol with Cu as Si–O–Cu. The intensity of the band at 3426 cm− 1 decreased with the increment of % Cu. The type of change in the Si-OH bond at 960 cm− 1 was already observed in Ni/MSN catalyst [47]. In addition to that, a band observed at 1613 cm− 1 (–OH bending) and 1003 cm− 1 (Si–O stretching) are also due to the silica framework in the Laponite support [48]. The reduction in peak intensity at 956 cm− 1 was observed which is due to the –OH group substitution possibly by O–Ni and O–Cu, thereby creating Si–O–Ni and Si–O–Cu bonding."
14,Catalytic activity,The cost-effective and metal-based NiCu/Laponite catalyst synthesised is tested for liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural into fuel range components. The hydrogenation efficiency of the synthesized catalysts was measured using a bench top stainless steel autoclave reactor under liquid phase reaction condition of furfural at 150–210 °C under 10–25 bar H2 pressure for a period of 1–6 h.
15,Effect of temperature,"4.1 Effect of temperature The hydrogenation of furfural reaction was studied as a function of temperature ranging from 150 to 210 °C on 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite, and the product distribution is displayed in Fig. 8 (A). As the temperature is raised above the boiling point of the furfural (161.7 °C), a concomitant increase in conversion and yield is observed. The conversion of 100% furfural was noticed at 190 °C, and the further rise in temperature resulted in a decrease in the conversion and product yield. A maximum conversion (99%) with 36% of 2-MF yield was recorded at 190 °C. It is also noted that an increase in reaction temperature has a profound effect on a considerable amount of formation of FOH, THFA, and IPFE. At high temperatures, the hydrogenation reaction of furfural goes through hydrogenolysis and decarbonylation as reported for the hydrodeoxygenation [7]. Moreover, at the high temperature, a decrease in the conversion of furfural and product yield observed may be due to coke formation or the occurrence of competitive adsorption of reactant molecules. Hence, 190 °C is considered as the optimum reaction temperature for obtaining maximum conversion (99%) and yield of 2MF (36%)."
16,Effect of pressure,"4.2 Effect of pressure In addition to the effect of temperature, the effect of pressure on the conversion and product yield was also studied to optimize the pressure using the same, 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite as a catalyst at various hydrogen pressures ranging from 5 to 25 bar at 190 °C (Fig. 8B). With the increase in applied pressure from 5 to 20 bar, furfural conversion and MF yield increased and attained maximum at 20 bar H2 pressure Fig. 8 (B). Beyond 20 bar pressure, conversion and product yield slightly declined. Hence, from the result, it is clear that 20 bar can be assumed as an optimum pressure for obtaining maximum conversion and product yield. It can be due to the appropriate residential time of reactant molecules to stay over the catalyst surface to facilitate the hydrogenation reaction."
17,Effect of time on stream (TOS),"4.3 Effect of time on stream (TOS) The catalytic activity was measured as a function of time on stream (TOS) at 190 °C under 20 bar H2 pressure on 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite catalyst, and the results are displayed in Fig. 8 (C). It was observed that 89% of furfural was converted within 3 h with a 20% yield of MF, FOH, THFA, and IPMF. Increasing the reaction time to 4 h lead to complete conversion with the slightly increased yield of the above products, and the reaction attained a steady-state thereafter. These results indicated that optimized reaction time is essential to obtain maximum conversion and product yield. With the elapsing of reaction time, MF and IPFE yield gradually increased. From this reaction occurrence, it can be concluded that furfural was adsorbed on the catalyst surface, converted into furfural alcohol, which on further hydrogenation produce THFA, and direct deoxygenation results in the formation of MF on Cu surface [43]."
18,Effect of Cu loading,"4.4 Effect of Cu loading The synthesized catalysts with different loading of copper (x = 8 to 12%) on 5Ni-x Cu/ Laponite were tested for the hydrogenation of furfural under optimized reaction conditions (190 °C, 20 bar hydrogen pressure for 4 h) in the IPA solvent medium to understand the role of copper content. All the Ni − Cu supported bimetallic catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity towards furfural conversion and different product yields (Fig. 9 ). It could be easily noticed that % Cu loading influence the conversion and product yield. 90% of conversion of furfural was achieved and % yield of 32, 15, 20, and 23% of FOH, THFA, MF, and IPFE on 5Ni-8Cu/Laponite catalyst. When the Cu loading was increased from 8 to 12%, the % conversion also increased, attained maximum on 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite catalyst from 90 to 99% conversion and % yield of FOH, THFA, MF, and IPFE of 30, 15, and 36 and 18 were recorded. The increase in conversion and product yield on 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite is due to the optimum loading of Cu and Ni on the surface of the support compared to all other bimetallic catalysts. FOL and MF were the targetted products as a result of this reaction (Fig. 9). The enhanced conversion and product yield are due to better hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis ability of Ni catalyst upon optimum loading Cu. This can possibly be attributed to the synergetic effect between Ni and Cu species and the dispersion of these species on the Laponite support (Fig. 1). Further loading of Cu beyond 12% decreased the conversion and product yield considerably. These results are in agreement with previous reports on the furfural conversion over Ni and Cu supported catalysts [21]. The specific reaction rate SRR and TOF values have been calculated for this reaction, and the results are presented in Table 3 . The SRR values of the 5Ni-8Cu/Laponite, 5Ni-10Cu/Laponite, 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite and 5Ni-14Cu/Laponite catalysts are 0.9 × 10− 6 mol L−1 g− 1 s−1, 1.0 × 10− 6 mol L−1 g− 1 s−1, 1.8 × 10− 6 mol L−1 g− 1 s−1, 1.1 × 10− 6 mol L−1 g− 1 s−1 respectively. TOF values of the catalysts are 4.5 × 10− 2 s−1, 3.7 × 10− 2 s−1, 5.2 × 10− 2 s−1 and 2.6 × 10− 2 s−1 Among the catalysts, 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite exhibited a high reaction rate of 1.8 × 10− 6 mol L−1 g− 1 s−1 and high TOF value of 5.2 × 10− 2 s−1,. It is evident from the results that the catalyst with very low copper exhibited the lowest TOF value, and the catalyst with 12% Copper exhibited the highest TOF value. Table 2 reveals that there is a direct correlation of activity of the catalyst with Hydrogen consumption value measured by the H2 pulse chemisorption experiment and with the acidity values measured from NH3 TPD experiment. Hence, a very low TOF value of 5 Ni-8Cu/Laponite can be attributed due to poor acidity and low H2 consumption values (Table 2) and the high TOF value of 5 Ni-12Cu/Laponite catalysts due to high H2 consumption value and optimum total acidity. The results accounted for the synergetic effect between 12 Cu and 5% Ni on the Laponite support. These results clearly account for the availability of a larger number of accessible active sites for the hydrogenation of furfural on the catalyst surface. The amount of Cu loading (8–12%) enhances the textural properties of the catalyst and influences hydrogenation of furfural. Particularly, 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite catalyst showed better catalytic performance compared to all other catalysts. It is due to the enhanced textural properties and surface morphology of the catalyst (XRD, N2 sorption studies, NH3-TPD and HR-TEM) (Fig. 2). Further, high dispersion of active metal species and hydrogen uptake were seen on the Laponite support (XRD, H2 pulse Chemisorption). Ni and Cu oxide reduction and synergistic interaction between bimetallic Ni and Cu species on the laponite support was supported by H2-TPR results. FT-IR and XPS results validate the surface interaction (Si–O–Cu and Si–O–Ni bond formation) and coordination of Ni and Cu on the support. These experimental results clearly demonstrated the observed hydrogenation ability of 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite catalyst. Bulk CuO/(Cu + Ni) ratio was calculated from the ICP-OES result and presented in Table 2. It is clear that with increasing wt.% of Cu on the 5Ni-x Cu/Laponite (x = 8 to 14%) catalyst, the CuO/(Cu + Ni) ratio also increased. Among all the ratios, the 0.84 ratio of 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite catalyst showed better catalyst performance. This is evident that this ratio is optimum for the synergetic effect of Ni and Cu on the surface of Laponite support which was supported by XRD, NH3-TPD, and H2 pulse Chemisorption results. A comparison of liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural on 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite catalyst was also made with the catalysts reported in the literature (Table 4 )."
19,Possible reaction pathway of furfural hydrogenation on 5Ni-xCu/Laponite catalysts,"4.5 Possible reaction pathway of furfural hydrogenation on 5Ni-xCu/Laponite catalysts Based on the distribution of products of furfural hydrogenation, the possible reaction pathway was proposed and displayed in Fig. 10 . The hydrogenation of furfural took place in two different pathways. At first, furfural was hydrogenated to furfural alcohol, followed by hydrogenation of FA, i.e., furan ring hydrogenation led to the formation of the final product THFA. While direct hydrogenolysis of FA led to the formation of 2MF. During this process, copper and nickel metallic species were synergistically involved in the hydrogenation of the C=O bond into C-OH and dehydration into 2MF. Hence, it is clear that nickel catalysts play a vital role in the reduction of the aldehyde group to the hydroxyl group whereas, nickel-copper species are not involved in the synergistic role in the dehydration of the alcohol group. In another pathway, an undesired condensation reaction between alcohol and IPA solvent possibly occurred to form isopropyl furfural ether (IPFE) due to the acidic nature of the catalyst."
20,Study of recyclability and stability of spent catalysts,"4.6 Study of recyclability and stability of spent catalysts The thermogram of all the fresh catalysts (calcined) is presented in Fig. 11 (A), which displays the thermal stability and decomposition profile of the catalysts at various temperature regions. The results clearly indicated that the initial weight loss observed between 100 and 200 °C on all the catalysts is due to loss of physisorbed water present on the clay galleries of the Laponite support [49]. The second weight loss of about 5% observed is due to dehydroxylation of the surface silanol group (−Si–O–Si–O–H) present in the Laponite support. Comparatively, 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite seems to be stable than other catalysts. Hence, it is evident that Laponite derived catalysts are stable. In order to understand the practical applicability of the catalyst, the best 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite was tested up to five cycles, and the results are displayed in Fig. 11 (B). A slight change in the second cycle led to the reduction of conversion up to 4%. Later, the conversion and product selectivity were retained without substantial loss up to five cycles, which were probably due to the blockage of some quantity of active sites through the coke formation on the surface of the catalysts. In order to illustrate the stability of spent 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite, N2 sorption analysis was carried out, and comparison isotherms of fresh and spent catalysts were obtained as presented in Fig. 11 (C). The N2 sorption study confirmed that there is a slight drop in surface area of the spent 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite after the fifth cycle from 200 m2/g to 180 m2/g, which accounts for the stability of the catalysts (Table 1). The results together support the stability and practical applicability of the 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite for industrial applications."
21,Conclusions,"A series of bimetallic 5 %Ni-xCu (x = 8–14%) catalysts supported on Laponite clay has been prepared by a simple co-impregnation method. The synthesized catalysts were investigated for hydrogenation of furfural under optimized reaction conditions in a stainless steel autoclave reactor (Batch reactor set up). In addition to that, the influence of various reaction parameters was also studied. The XRD pattern evidenced that the catalyst contains bimetallic Ni and Ni-Cu species, and the BET measurement confirmed that reduction in surface area on the increment of Cu loading on the support. TPD/TPR result confirmed that all the catalysts possess surface acidity and exhibited reduction behaviour of catalysts. Among all the catalysts, 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite exhibited high catalytic activity (99% conversion and SRR 1.8 × 10− 6 mol g− 1 s−1) and TOF value (5.2 × 10− 2 s−1). The high catalytic activity of 5 Ni-12Cu/Laponite was associated with high consumption of hydrogen (310 μmol/g) and high surface acidity (1.0 mmol/g) supported by hydrogen chemisorption and TPD results, respectively. TGA analysis of fresh catalysts showed that the catalyst possesses high thermal stability. N2 sorption of recycled catalyst and TOS study together validated that fresh and spent catalysts were stable even after longer reaction time, which emphasized that the developed catalytic system has excellent prospects and suits heterogeneous operation for furfural hydrogenation. To conclude, the addition of copper enhances the catalytic action of Ni due to the synergistic effect on Laponite support, and the developed catalyst is very economical for the hydrogenation of furfural at low pressures of hydrogen in terms of stability for industrial applications."
22,Future research,We have planned to synthesis heteroatom pillared Laponite clay to enhance the textural properties of the material. The synthesized material will be subjected to hydrodeoxygenation of hemicelluloses model compounds to get fuel range hydrocarbons. We have also planned to blend such hydrocarbons with diesel for engine trails. Such blended fuel is expected to improve combustion and will reduce the emission of products of SOx and NOx.
