0,Introduction,"Porous carbon materials as supports for metal-based heterogeneous catalysis have been used widely in hydrogenation, oxidation, and coupling reactions, as these supports are very inert in different media and exhibit such attractive properties as low density, high surface area, and cavity volume [1,2]. However, the weak interaction between the metal nanoparticles (NPs) and the pure carbon supports often leads to the leaching of metal NPs and the aggregation/sintering of these NPs during catalytic reactions on account of their high surface energies [3–4]. In order to overcome these drawbacks, heteroatom-doped—particularly nitrogen (N) doped—can provide an effective route to improve metal-support interactions [5]. This is because the enhanced electron density offered by active N sites can promote the dispersion of metal NPs, causing the N-doped porous carbon (NPC) support to be a wonderful substrate to anchor metal NPs with high stability, small size, and high dispersion [6–7]. The general ways to incorporate N into porous carbon materials includes: pyrolyzing carbon in N-containing reagent (e.g., NH3 and amines) environments [8], and direct carbonization from N-containing precursors or a mixture of the N-dopants [9]. These synthesized NPCs have been frequently reported as the support for metal nanoparticles, however, during the post-loading of metal species on these materials it is difficult to control the size and distribution of metal nanoparticles [6]. Recently, in situ pyrolysis of metal-doped nanoporous materials for the direct fabrication of NPC supported metal NPs, such as the carbon materials derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [10], zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) [11], and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) [12], has emerged as a simple, efficient and promising approach. These N-containing nanoporous supports not only can provide N-doped to tailor the properties of carbon matrices, but also can act as hosts to confine the metal NPs inside the inner void nanospaces and prevent their size from increasing further [13]. Among various nanoporous materials, hyper-crosslinked polymers (HCPs) possess the features of facile preparation and monomer diversity [14–16], which can easily produce the N-doped porous precursors by hyper-crosslinking N-containing monomer. After calcination treatment of hyper-crosslinked polymers, the obtained porous carbon nanomaterials could be widely used in the applications of carbon dioxide capture [17–18], water purification [19], or supercapacitors [20]. However, the report about in situ preparation of NPC supported metal catalysts using HCPs as precursors is rare, and the reasons mainly attributed to the surface-covering carbon layer derived from polymeric materials grows on the active metal particles during the carbonization process [21–22], which blocks the catalyst surface and, thus, deactivates the activity of the NPC-supported metal catalysts [23–24]. Various methods have been developed to remove the surface-covering carbon layer on the metal nanoparticles, such as treatment with H2O2, followed by reduction with H2 [25], or by heat treatment in air atmosphere [26], as well as employing ozonized acidic solutions [27]. Even though some superior catalysts have been achieved by these approaches, they require relatively high temperatures (200–300 °C) for H2 reduction or further acid treatment by corrosive acids (e.g., HClO4), which are not beneficial for their practical applications. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a simple and facile strategy to fabricate universally applicable carbon-supported metal catalysts. Herein, we develop a mild H2O2 post-treatment assisted method to in situ encapsulate ultrafine Pd NPs in N-doped porous carbon derived from hyper-crosslinked polymers. This method, without dangerous H2 reduction or excess corrosive reduction processes, improves ease of handling and large-scale production. Moreover, we can successfully tune the Pd nanoparticle size from 5.3 nm to 1.3 nm with narrow size distributions by changing the content of metal loading. Additionally, the post-treatment by H2O2 can result in a transformation from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity for the NPC support, and catalytic hydrogenation reactions by Pd/NPC-H2O2 exhibit significantly improved catalytic performances, while the as-prepared Pd/NPC is nearly inert. All these observations confirmed that this design strategy not only achieves highly stable and active Pd NPs within the network, but also can tune the Pd NPs size and physiochemical characteristic of NPC for optimizing the catalytic activity and selectivity."
1,Results and discussion,"Catalyst preparation and characterization. Scheme 1 illustrates the synthesis procedure for Pd/NPC-H2O2 catalysts based on an in situ pyrolysis reduction strategy using N-doped HCPs (N-HCPs) and palladium acetate (Pd(OAc)2) as precursors. First, the N-HCPs materials were synthesized by a simple Friedel-Crafts reaction of benzene and benzylamine with formaldehyde dimethyl ether (FDA) as a cross-linker under the catalysis of anhydrous FeCl3. Next, upon the facile impregnation of N-HCPs with Pd(OAc)2, carbonization was performed by heating the N-HCPs/Pd(OAc)2 powder mixture to the target temperature. Finally, the Pd/NPC-H2O2 catalysts can be obtained by a mild H2O2 post-treatment process (see the Supporting Information for details). As a comparison, non-heteroatom-doped and phosphorus (P)-doped HCPs (denoted as PC and PPC, respectively) were also used as precursors to prepare Pd/PC-H2O2 or Pd/PPC-H2O2 composites with a similar procedure, except for using benzene or triphenylphosphine to replace benzylamine monomer (Scheme S1). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to determine the thermal stability of the N-HCPs, mimicking the conditions to be used for pyrolysis. For Pd/N-HCPs (Fig. 1 a), some mass loss below 100 °C was observed due to the evaporation of physisorbed atmospheric water because the N atoms present in polymers have strong affinities for water [17]. The Pd/N-HCPs begin to reach relatively thermostable conditions when the temperature is slowly increased to ca. 500 °C under N2 atmosphere. Meanwhile, the graphitization degree of Pd/N-HCPs were characterized by Raman spectrum (Figure S1) with the D band to the G band intensity ratio (ID/IG ) calculated to be 0.93, implying a great degree of structure disorder. Therefore, 500 °C was chosen as the carbonization temperature (except for specific instructions, all the data was characterized at 500 °C below). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples calcinated at 500 °C (Fig. 1b) were carried out to further demonstrate whether Pd NPs were formed. It can be seen that three characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ values around 40.1°, 46.2°, and 67.2° were observed in the XRD patterns of the Pd/NPC (2.8 nm) nanocomposites, which were assigned to the (111), (200), and (220) crystalline reflections, respectively (JCPDS: 05–0681). After post-treatment by H2O2, the characteristic diffraction peaks of Pd (0) still remained, which confirmed that the post-treatment procedure did not destroy the Pd NPs crystalline structure. However, no obvious characteristic diffraction peaks of Pd were detected in Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm), and this was likely due to the small crystalline size and good dispersion of Pd (0) [28], which is also confirmed by TEM images in Fig. 2 . All these experiments confirmed that Pd NPs could be formed by carbonization at 500 °C, and maintained their integrity after post-treatment by H2O2. N2 adsorption isotherm measurements were carried out at 77 K to measure the surface area and porosity of the resultant NPC supported Pd nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 1c, all the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were characteristic of type IV adsorption isotherms with a steep uptake at relatively low pressure (p/p0 < 0.01), indicating the existence of microporosity in the structure according to the IUPAC classification [29]. Moreover, an obvious H1-type hysteresis loop was observed in the range of 0.5–1.0 relative pressure, and the steep rise in the high p/p0 region indicates that there consists of a certain amount of mesopores [30]. These results are consistent with the pore size distribution (PSD) analysis shown in Fig. 1d, which the uniform nanoporous structure of NPC consisting of micro- and mesoporous pores with pore sizes of ca. 2 and 4 nm, respectively. Notably, NPCs can provide numerous anchor sites, providing an ideal environment for the accommodation of ultrafine Pd NPs, for the purpose of pre-impregnation of the metal precursor into the support; then the Pd NPs can be uniformly distributed with smaller particle sizes due to the in situ reduction and pore confinement effects, and mesoporosity can minimize diffusion barriers, and thus, enhance the mass transport in the carbonaceous structures [31–32]. After carbonization, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of Pd/NPC-500 °C increased from 595 m2/g to 662 m2/g, as seen in Table 1 , while the total pore volume decreased from 0.54 cm3/g to 0.37 cm3/g. This suggests that the in situ carbonization reduced Pd NPs from Pd(OAc)2 will lead to the partial occupation or blockage of the cavities. On the contrary, the BET surface area of Pd/NPC-500 °C-H2O2 slightly decreased from 662 m2/g to 561 m2/g by H2O2 post-treatment, and this can be attributed to the removal of carbon residues generated during the pyrolysis process [25]. When further increasing the carbonization temperature from 500 °C to 700 °C, the BET surface area of Pd/NPC-700 °C decreased from 662 m2/g to 585 m2/g. After H2O2 post-treatment, both the BET surface area and pore volume decreased, which may be caused by the collapse of the porous structure. It is known that metal loading influences the metal NPs size during the annealing process [33], that is, different input weight ratios of Pd(OAc)2 and N-HCPs resulted in different sizes of Pd NPs in Pd/NPC after calcination. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis characterizing the particle size distributions indicated that the average size of the Pd NPs synthesized in Pd/NPC-H2O2 was readily tuned from 2.8 nm (Fig. 2a-b) to 1.3 nm (Fig. 2c-d) with narrow size distributions when decreasing the content of Pd from 3.0 wt% to 0.6 wt%, as measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Pd (111) in the crystal lattice was observed with a lattice fringe distance of 2.2 Å (Fig. 2d, inset), which further confirmed the formation of Pd NPs in the Pd/NPC-H2O2. For comparison, the TEM image of Pd/PC-H2O2 without N-doped showed that the size of Pd NPs heavily increased to ~ 5.3 nm (Figure S2a-b), which indicated that the N-doped plays an important role for the formation of highly dispersed and ultrafine sized Pd NPs. In addition, Figure S3 and Fig. 2b showed that the Pd NPs size almost unchanged before and after H2O2 post-treatment, demonstrating that the Pd NPs can be firmly trapped within the carbon matrix and would not split into smaller ones or leached after H2O2 post-treatment. As for the universality of this method, we should note that Pd loaded P-doped porous carbon nanocomposites (Pd/PPC-H2O2) also had a uniform distribution of NPs (1.5 nm) within the framework (Figure S2c-d). Besides, it is worth mentioning that this general strategy can achieve mass production due to its facile processing, and about 2 g of the Pd/NPC-H2O2 can be easily obtained (Figure S4) in the laboratory after pyrolysis at 500 °C. The binding energy peaks in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements suggest the presence of C, N, O, and Pd elements on the surface of Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) as shown in Fig. 3 . The peak at 284.6 eV corresponds to the sp2 graphitic carbon species (Fig. 3a), while the other one at 285.4 eV assigned to the sp2-carbon containing N atoms, suggests the presence of N functionalities on the surface of NPC [34]. Three types of N species (Fig. 3b), with deconvoluted peaks located at 398.7, 400.1, and 401 eV, were detected, which are assigned to pyridinic, pyrrolic, and graphitic N, respectively [35]. The O 1 s spectrum (Fig. 3c) exhibits three peaks at binding energies of 531.8, 533.2 and 534.4 eV, which correspond to C=O, C-O and COOH, respectively [36]. Worthy to mention is that the content of O (Figure S5) after H2O2 post-treatment is much higher (12.55 at %) than the Pd/NPC (8.89 at %), determined by XPS, indicating the increased oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm). Additionally, the H2O2 post-treatment transforms the surface property of Pd/NPC from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity, which was further confirmed in Fig. 3e-3f by the fact that Pd/NPC-500 °C was floating on the liquid level (contact angle ~ 135°) while Pd/NPC-500 °C-H2O2 dispersed evenly on the H2O (contact angle ~ 36°). The surface chemical states of Pd NPs were fitted with spin–orbit 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 components (Fig. 3d), and the content of Pd on the surface of Pd/NPC-500 °C-H2O2 was about 0.58 wt% (Figure S5), which is close to the ICP-AES result (0.6 wt%). Before H2O2 post-treatment, the presence of Pd2+ (~16 at %) in Pd/NPC may be attributed to the oxidation of the surface Pd NPs in air, because of its high activity and the strong interactions between the precursors and the doped N, making it difficult to reduce the Pd2+ [5]. However, the content of Pd2+ in Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) increased (~23 at %) after H2O2 post-treatment (Fig. 3d and Figure S6), and this can be attributed to Pd NPs decomposition of H2O2 to O2 [37], partial oxidation of Pd0 to Pd2+. Combined with all the above characterization studies and analysis it could be concluded that the in situ pyrolysis reduction method to encapsulate Pd NPs into NPC supports by using N-doped HCPs, as well as post-treatment by H2O2 fulfilled the controlled metal NPs size and improved dispersibility under aqueous solution, which are key features utilized in catalytic applications. Catalytic performance investigation. Furfural (FAL) is one of the most important chemical platforms derived from biomass feedstocks, and one of its deep-hydrogenation products, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL), is an important green solvent used in agricultural applications and the printing industry due to its low toxicity and biodegradable nature [38–39]. However, the routine noble metal-based vapor phase catalytic procedure requires much higher pressure or temperature (>100 °C), which requires considerable energy and yields high amounts of by-products. Therefore, rational design and preparation of catalysts for direct hydrogenation of FAL to THFOL under mild conditions remains a great challenge. Herein, the catalytic ability of NPC supported Pd composites was studied by selective hydrogenation of FAL in different conditions. Choice of solvent is of paramount importance in heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation and may significantly alter the selectivity [40]. Table 2 presents the catalytic ability of Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) in varied solvents used, including polarity and solubility of H2. It is worthy of note that all three solvents (entries 1, 3, and 5) in which FAL can be hydrogenated to THFOL are protic solvents, whereas the other solvents, in which the conversion of THFOL is close to 0, are aprotic and polar (entries 4 and 6). Although the solubility of H2 in water is close to that of DMSO (entries 1 and 4), the catalytic outcome is distinctly different. These results indicate that in the hydrogenation of the FAL system, catalytic performance is influenced by solvents’ polarity, but not H2 solubility. This may attribute to the fact that hydrogenation rate is related to the H-bond donor capability of the solvents for protic solvents, and the decreased activation energy barrier results from the interaction between protic solvents and the substrate, despite the fact that aprotic polar solvents could strongly adsorb onto the catalyst surface and block the active sites, thereby inhibiting the hydrogenation rate [41]. When comparing the miscibility with FAL in different solvents, cyclohexane (Table 2, entry 2) was chosen as a representative organic solution because of its moderate miscibility with FAL, which exhibits similar miscibility with H2O. However, the catalytic conversion of FAL in cyclohexane is much lower than H2O, which indicates that catalytic performance was not related with either the H2 solubility or miscibility in various solvents. Considering the eco-friendly and catalytic performance, we selected H2O as the reaction medium for the following research. The kinetics curve of Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) catalyst for hydrogenation reaction of FAL in H2O was conducted at 40 °C and 1 MPa H2 to investigate the possible intermediates and reaction pathways. As shown in Figure S7, FAL was almost completely converted within 3 h, and in the beginning of reaction, the intermediate FOL was detected, which confirmed that FOL was the intermediate in the process of hydrogenating FOL to THFOL. Therefore, a possible reaction pathway was proposed. FAL was partially hydrogenated to FOL, and then, FOL was further hydrogenated to THFOL. We also investigated the relation between the conversion and the ratios of substrate to catalyst. The detailed results are shown in Table S1. We found that the conversion decreased apparently when the ratios of substrate to catalyst increased (the reaction setup is 50 mg of catalyst). Behind such superior catalytic performance of Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) in aqueous solution, we were eager to explore the key scientific factors, including post-treatment procedure and N-doped, that may affect the performance of NPC catalytic materials. It is generally acknowledged that the catalyst deactivation during the annealing treatment at high temperature results from a surface-covering carbon layer growing on the active particles, blocking the access of metal NPs and reactants [42]. In addition, the wettability of the catalyst surface also influences the diffusion of substrate and product molecules [43]. For entry 3 in Table 3 , the Pd/NPC (1.3 nm) did not show any catalytic performance, which can be attributed to the fact that the surface-covering carbon layer during in situ pyrolysis reduction blocked the catalytic site [25]. We have tried to monitor the generated carbon layer on the surface of Pd NPs during pyrolysis by HRTEM, but it is difficult to differentiate the NPC support and carbonaceous residues on Pd NPs. As an alternative method, CO diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT) measurements can be used to verify the changes of the surface adsorption characteristics. However, unfortunately, CO–DRIFT spectra for Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) did not give the positive results, which might be related to their low Pd content (0.6 wt%). The DRIFT spectra of CO adsorption on Pd/NPC (2.8 nm) and Pd/NPC-H2O2 (2.8 nm) catalysts were further investigated and the results are shown in Figure S8. The resulting spectra showed that the strong peaks above 2100 cm-1 were due to gas-phase CO, while the adsorption bands at 2085 cm−1, 2033 cm−1, and 1996 cm−1 are ascribed to the CO adsorption on the surface of Pd nanoparticles [44,45]; the absence of adsorption bands at 2085 cm−1, 2033 cm−1, and 1996 cm−1 were observed for Pd/NPC (2.8 nm) upon N2 purge, which further suggested that the surface covering carbon layer hampered the CO adsorption on the surface of Pd NPs without H2O2 post-treatment (Figure S8a). Interestingly, for Pd/NPC-H2O2 (2.8 nm) catalyst with H2O2 post-treatment, the adsorption bands at 2085 cm−1, 2033 cm−1, and 1996 cm−1 were still observed once N2 purge finished, confirming the existence of CO adsorption on the surface of Pd nanoparticles and the carbon layer on the surface of Pd NPs could be removed by H2O2 post-treatment (Figure S8b). After H2O2 post treatment, the as-obtained Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) in entry 4 obtained conversion of 100%. To determine the underlying reasons for such distinct differences in activity before and after H2O2 treatment, we utilized HNO3 for comparison because it often was observed to corrode or remove carbonaceous residues on the surface of the active metals [36]. Besides, a hydrophilic surface helps to promote catalyst dispersion and enables more efficient enrichment of reactants for accelerating the reaction when conducting the catalytic reaction in aqueous media [46]. The contact angle of a water droplet on the surface of Pd/NPC-HNO3 (1.3 nm, ~ 53°, see Figure S9) was similar with that of Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm, ~ 36°), indicating the generated hydrophilic surface after being post-treated by HNO3. In this work, Pd/NPC (1.3 nm) catalysts exhibit much lower activities after post-treatment by HNO3 than by H2O2 because the degree of exposure of the catalytically active sites to reactants is much lower [47]. The reason is that, during the H2O2 post-treatment process, Pd NPs decompose H2O2 to O2 [37], therefore it corrodes the carbonaceous residues around Pd NPs and increases the O content on the surface of Pd/NPC-H2O2 (Figure S5 and S6). As for the HNO3 post-treatment process, however, HNO3 cannot generate O2 around Pd NPs, instead gently introducing some oxygen-containing groups on the surface of Pd/NPC-HNO3, far from removing the surface-covering carbon layer on the Pd NPs. It can be seen in entry 5 of Table 3 that the conversion over Pd/NPC-HNO3 (1.3 nm) was much lower (7.7%) and the selectivity to THFOL decreased to 16.7%, indicating that the catalytic activity not only related to the wettability but was also strongly influenced by the surface-covering carbon layer on the Pd catalyst. N-doped has several attractive properties such as (1) increased metal dispersion and stability, which provides enhanced metal use efficiency; (2) improved dispersion in aqueous solution and further suppressed leaching of metal NPs during catalytic reactions [6]. Compared to N-free porous carbon support (Pd/PC-H2O2 (5.3 nm)), it can be seen that the catalytic performance can be effectively improved by the introduced N into the porous carbon matrix (Table 3, entries 1 and 2). Commercially available Pd/C catalysts (Table 3, entries 7) further confirmed that N-doped helps to improve the catalytic performance. Worthy to mention is that Pd/NPC-700 °C (3.5 nm) has almost no catalytic performance when the carbonization temperature is 700 °C, even when employing the same post-treatment procedure by H2O2. We expect that the amount of N dopants will be decreased by high-temperature annealing [2], leading to the migration or the coalescence of metal species between nanoparticles [4]. TEM images (Figure S10) also confirmed that Pd NPs aggregate into large particles (3.5 nm) at elevated temperature, due to the sintering phenomena deactivation of catalytic reactivity [48]. Next, we studied the influence of particle size on the catalytic performance of the catalysts. Compared Pd/NPC-H2O2 (2.8 nm) to Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm), the TOF values apparently increased when the diameter of Pd NPs decreased from 2.8 nm to 1.3 nm (Table S2 entries 2 and 3), implying that NPs size plays a key role in determining the catalytic behavior during FAL hydrogenation. Indeed, as the Pd NP size decreases, the d-band center shifts toward the Fermi level energy [49], resulting in the strengthened adsorption of FAL, which favors the accumulation of adsorbate around Pd NPs. To further demonstrate the generality of the hydrogenation of FAL, Pd/PPC-H2O2 (1.5 nm) was performed under the same catalytic conditions (Table 3, entry 6), giving 100% conversion and approximate TOF values with Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) (Table S2). These results demonstrate that such in situ pyrolysis reduction methods can be applied for preparing various efficient metal-based carbon catalysts from N or P-doped HCPs. In addition, various catalysts’ selectivity and activity were compared at low conversion (~25%). As shown in Table S2, the results indicated that various catalysts have a similar selectivity except that Pd/C catalyst showed a relative high selectivity for the production of THFOL. However, Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) catalyst showed the highest TOF value, further confirming its excellent catalytic activity. Recycling tests were then performed, measuring the activity and morphology after eight cycles of catalysis, because the recyclability and long-term stability of any catalysts are essential features for their practical application. For the cycle experiment of hydrogenation of FAL, the recovered Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) after eight runs exhibited almost equal catalytic performance to that of the pristine one at about 60% conversion (Fig. 4 a), thus indicating the excellent durability and recyclability of the catalyst. Figure S11 displays the hot filtering run at different reaction times by hydrogenation of FAL to THFOL. After filtering the catalyst of Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) in 1 h, the yield of THFOL did not significantly change over the next 2 h, indicating that the Pd NPs were confined in the catalyst without any leakage. These results also agreed well with ICP-AES analysis, which indicated that the filtrate showed no Pd leaching (<10 ppb) during catalysis. BET surface area or pore size (Fig. 4c and Table 1) and TEM imaging (Fig. 4d) of the Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) reveals no measurable changes after catalysis. XPS measurement was carried out to further analyze the chemical state of Pd in spent catalyst Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm). As shown in Figure S12d, the content of Pd2+ slightly increased from 23 at % to 35 at % after recycling tests, while other elements almost unchanged. In order to further demonstrate the thermal stability of Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm), a catalytic reaction at much higher temperature (100 °C) and pressure (3 MPa) was chosen for selective hydrogenation of quinoline. The catalytic performance and recycling tests (Fig. 4b) showed that Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) was thermally stable after eight runs and that the excellent catalytic performance of Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) is comparable to or outperforms a majority of previously reported hydrogenation catalysts (Table S3 and S4)."
2,Conclusion,"In summary, we have reported an in situ pyrolysis reduction strategy for encapsulation of Pd NPs in N, or P-doped porous carbon, in which the size of Pd NPs can readily be controlled. Specifically, through mild H2O2 post-treatment, the surface-covering carbon layer of Pd NPs can be facilely removed and the physiochemical properties of the substrate surface can be changed, which has great influence for catalysis applications. For instance, FAL hydrogenation reactions done by Pd/NPC-H2O2 (1.3 nm) demonstrated that the “naked” active Pd NPs and the increased hydrophilic catalyst surface derived from H2O2 post-treatment promotes high catalytic activity and selectivity in aqueous media. In addition, the recycling experiments of FAL hydrogenation reactions and the high temperature (100 °C) hydrogenation of quinoline further demonstrated that synthesized carbon-based catalysts had great stability, exhibiting its potential as an industrial scale catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence showing that hyper-crosslinked polymers loaded with Pd NPs can undergo in situ pyrolysis reduction to create highly efficient, stable, and selective carbon-based catalysts. We believe this strategy not only provides a reliable method for the direct application of carbonized hyper-crosslinked polymers in heterogeneous catalysis, but also offers opportunities to design other ultrafine metal NPs carbon materials in other fields. Future efforts will investigate the etching mechanism of the surface-covering carbon layer by mild H2O2 post-treatment and further study the relationship between the catalysis performance and the morphology of the carbon-based catalysts derived from hyper-crosslinked polymers at a large scale."
