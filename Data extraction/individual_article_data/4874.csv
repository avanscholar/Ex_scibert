0,Introduction,"The useful application of biomass derived materials is attracting much attention from industry and academia. One of interesting applications is the production of H2 from chemical and photochemical transformations of those materials [1–3]. The photocatalytic H2 production can be performed under mild conditions and several authors studied different biomass derived model materials including alcohols, glycerol, glucose, sugars, and so on. Recently a larger amount of glycerol is produced as a byproduct in the production of biodiesel and so it is desirable to find its application [4]. The heterogeneous photocatalytic H2 production from aqueous glycerol solutions (Scheme 1 ) was studied by several authors using TiO2 based catalysts loaded with Pt [5–8], Pd [9], and CuO x [10–12]. Fornasiero et al. prepared active Cu/TiO2 catalysts by a water-in-oil microemulsion method, in which Cu nanoparticles were embedded in the TiO2, and these were active for the H2 production from glycerol and water under visible light irradiation conditions [10]. The doping of NiO x onto the surface of TiO2 is effective for the preparation of p-type (NiO x )–n-type (TiO2) junction [13]. Such NiO x -doped TiO2 catalysts were recently reported to show good performance of photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds of methyl orange [14], methylene blue [15], and 2-naphthol and p-cresol [16]. In the present work, the authors prepared NiO x /TiO2 catalysts by conventional impregnation and tested their performance in photocatalytic H2 production from a mixture of glycerol and water under UV/vis irradiation conditions. We could find few published study that has considered the use of NiO x /TiO2 photo-sensitive materials for such a H2 production from biomass derived compounds."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation A TiO2 material supplied by Catalysis Society of Japan was used, which was a mixture of anatase and rutile TiO2. The structural properties will be presented later (Table 1 ). The doping of Ni species was made by conventional impregnation with nickel nitrate (Wako) and the loading of Ni species was 10% by weight assuming Ni species was in the form of NiO. A weighed TiO2 (1g) was dispersed in 10cm3 Ni(NO3)2 aqueous solution (0.15M) and the slurry formed was continuously stirred overnight for sufficient impregnation. The mixture was kept in an oven at 80°C for 12h to remove the solvent (water). Then, the solid sample was ground and calcined in a muffle furnace while passing air at 50cm3 min−1 at 250, 450 and 650°C for 3h. The catalysts so prepared are denoted by NiO x /TiO2 hereinafter."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The surface and bulk properties of NiO x /TiO2 samples prepared were characterized by different methods. BET surface area was measured by N2 adsorption at −196°C (Quantachrome NOVA 1000). Prior to N2 physisorption, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 150°C for 2h. Structural properties were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku D/Max-2500 PC) with Cu Kα radiation and a Ni filter. XRD patterns were measured from 20° to 80° at a rate of 1°min−1. Diffuse reflection UV/vis spectra were recorded under ambient conditions (Shimadzu UV-3100PC) using BaSO4 matrix as background under ambient conditions. The spectra measured were converted to the absorption spectra by using the Kubelka–Munk function. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (JEOL JPS-9200) was used to examine the surface properties and all the binding energies were referenced with respect to the Ti 2p at 485.5eV [17]."
4,Photocatalytic reaction,"2.3 Photocatalytic reaction Photocatalytic reactions were conducted in the same reactor as used previously, which was a 50cm3 stainless steel autoclave with two quartz windows (diameter 1cm) [18]. It was previously used for photocatalytic water splitting in the presence of pressurized CO2. A weighed sample (20mg) was suspended in a mixture of 10cm3 water and 2cm3 glycerol (Wako) in the reactor. The air remaining in the reactor was removed by purging with 1MPa N2 for five times. The reactor was placed on a heating plate and wrapped by a heating tape. The temperature was monitored by a thermocouple embedded in the reactor wall. The reactor was heated while stirring the reaction mixture by a magnetic stirrer. The reaction mixture was illuminated using a 500W high-pressure Hg lamp (Ushio USH-500SC) at 50°C for 4h. The lamp emits predominantly the light of wavelengths at 365nm, 405nm, and 436nm. After the reaction, the gaseous products evolved were collected in a gas trap. The amount of H2 was determined by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A, molecular sieve 5A packed column, TCD detector, N2 carrier) and those of CO, CO2, and CH4 by another gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A, Porapak Q packed column, FID detector, N2 carrier) with a methanizer converting those gases into CH4."
5,Results and discussion,"In the present work, 10wt% NiO x /TiO2 catalysts calcined at different temperatures were used for the photocatalytic H2 production from aqueous glycerol solution. The 10wt% NiO loading approximately corresponds to monolayer coverage of NiO species over the surface of TiO2 used that has a BET surface area of 50m2 g−1. The state of NiO x dispersion (namely, the state of NiO x –TiO2 junction/contact) was varied by changing the calcination temperature."
6,Catalytic performance,"3.1 Catalytic performance First, the performance of NiO x -unloaded TiO2 samples calcined at different temperatures was examined for photocatalytic H2 production from a mixture of glycerol and water at 50°C. Fig. 1 shows the rates of evolution of H2 and other gaseous products of CO2 and CO in photocatalytic reforming of glycerol at 50°C. The evolution of CH4 was not detected. When the calcination temperature was raised, the rate of H2 evolution increased, had a maximum at 450°C, and then decreased. The maximum H2 evolution was 320μmolg−1 h−1 under the conditions used. The amount of CO2 evolved did not change so much but that of CO increased with the temperature. The evolution of H2 was larger than that of CO2 and CO for the catalysts calcined at 450°C or below but smaller for the one at 650°C. In addition, blank experiments were conducted in the absence of light and/or catalyst under the same reaction conditions. No H2 production was detected in these blank reactions, indicating that both the light and the TiO2 catalyst are required for the photocatalytic H2 production from glycerol and water. Then, the catalytic performance of NiO x -loaded TiO2 samples was tested and the results obtained are also shown in Fig. 1. The rate of H2 evolution changed with the calcination temperature in a similar manner as observed with the NiO x -unloaded samples. The maximum H2 evolution appeared at the same temperature of 450°C, being 900μmolg−1 h−1. It was about three times larger compared to the maximum with the NiO x -unloaded sample calcined at 450°C. Thus, the loading of NiO x to TiO2 can improve its photocatalytic performance. The total amount of CO2 and CO formed was comparable to that of H2 evolved for either 250°C or 450°C calcined NiO x /TiO2 catalyst. However, the ratio of CO2 against CO is different, being 1.8 and 5.4 for the former and latter catalysts, respectively. CH4 was also detected to form for the 650°C calcined sample. In addition, the performance of NiO alone was tested under the same reaction conditions. The NiO powder was prepared by calcining Ni(NO3)2 at 450°C in an air stream of 50cm3 min−1 for 3h and grinding in a mortar. This treatment changed Ni(NO3)2 to NiO, which was confirmed by XRD (not shown). It was found that H2, CO, and CH4 were evolved at rates of 91, 2124, and 917μmolg−1 h−1, respectively. That is, compared to the above-mentioned NiO x /TiO2 sample calcined at the same temperature, the amount of H2 was even smaller while those of CO and CH4 were even larger. Hence, reactions with NiO alone are different from those with NiO x /TiO2 catalysts and so NiO is not effective for our target H2 production from aqueous glycerol solution, for which the significance of NiO x –TiO2 junction/contact is again illustrated. Hydrogen could be produced through the two reactions in which one is photo-splitting of water and the other is photo-reforming of glycerol with water (Scheme 1). To examine the significance of the two reactions, the NiO x /TiO2 samples calcined at 250°C, 450°C, and 650°C were also tested for the photocatalytic H2 production from water in the absence of glycerol. The maximum H2 production was observed to occur for the 450°C calcined sample. However, it was only 6.6μmolg−1 h−1, which was smaller by two orders of magnitude than that in the presence of glycerol. Hence, for a mixture of glycerol and water, the H2 was evolved through photocatalytic reaction between the two. The most active 450°C calcined catalyst was further tested for longer reaction periods of time. Fig. 2 indicates the time profile obtained, showing that the H2 production continued to occur at an almost fixed rate during the reaction up to 12h and so the catalyst did not change in its activity. In our reaction runs, gas chromatograph analysis was tried to detect possible liquid products of CH3OH, HCOOH, CH3OH, and C2H5OH. We failed to detect such products, which may be ascribed to low conversion of glycerol (<0.05% estimated rough from the initial amount of glycerol used and the total amount of H2 evolved in 4h with the most active catalyst) and/or these should easily be changed to gaseous products by action of NiO. The photocatalytic production of H2 from aqueous glycol solution was recently studied over TiO2 catalysts in the absence of costly noble metals [10–12]. Fornasiero et al. prepared several types of CuO x /TiO2 catalysts by different methods and showed that Cu nanoparticle embedded TiO2 catalysts prepared by a water-in-oil microemulsion method have superior performance compared to conventional Cu/TiO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation [10,11]. The performance of our NiO x /TiO2 catalysts prepared by conventional impregnation is comparable to their Cu/TiO2 catalysts. Lalitha et al. also studied the performance of CuO x /TiO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation and calcination at 350°C and 450°C [12]. The photocatalysts of Fornasiero et al. and Lalitha et al. are visible light sensitive. (Our NiO x /TiO2 catalysts have not been tested under visible light conditions due to the limitation of experimental setup.)"
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.2 Catalyst characterization The properties of NiO x -loaded and unloaded TiO2 samples calcined at different temperatures were examined by different methods. Table 1 shows the results of N2 adsorption. The 650°C calcined sample had a markedly decreased surface area of 14m2 g−1. In contrast, the surface area of NiO x -unloaded TiO2 was observed to decrease to 43m2 g−1, indicating that the significant decrease in the surface area of NiO x -loaded TiO2 by the calcination at 650°C is induced by the doping of NiO x . Fig. 3 gives XRD patterns and the bulk phase composition and other parameters determined thereof. The anatase/rutile ratio was 83/17 and the size of TiO2 was 21nm for NiO x -unloaded mother TiO2 sample. These structural parameters did not change by the NiO x -loading and the following calcination at 250°C and 450°C. After the calcination at 650°C, however, the phase composition changed drastically to an anatase/rutile ratio of 9/91. The phase composition also changed by the calcination for NiO x -unloaded TiO2 but less markedly; the anatase/rutile ratio decreased to 59/41 by the calcination at 650°C. Thus, the phase transformation of TiO2 during the calcination was assisted by the presence of NiO x species. The average TiO2 crystallite size increased with the temperature but marginally. For the NiO x -loaded samples calcined at 250°C and 450°C, NiO was detected, the size being 4–6nm; NiO was highly dispersed on the surface of TiO2. On calcination at 650°C, the NiO changed to NiTiO3 with an average size of 51nm and the BET surface decreased significantly to 14m2 g−1. Fig. 4 shows UV/vis spectra of those NiO x -loaded and unloaded TiO2 samples. The loading of 10wt% NiO x was found to have a significant impact on the absorption at wavelength>350nm. The NiO x loading strengthened the absorption in this range of wavelength, depending on the calcination temperature used. These data were reformed to a plot of (absorbance·energy)1/2 against energy in Fig. 4(b). For NiO x -unloaded TiO2, the band gap was estimated to be 2.75eV; while, for the NiO x -loaded samples calcined at 250°C and 450°C, it was lowered to 2.17eV. The difference was 0.58eV. The decrease in the band gap energy may be one of factors responsible for the enhanced H2 production rate observed with the 250°C and 450°C calcined NiO x /TiO2 catalysts (Fig. 1). The band gap of TiO2 depends on its structure, being 3.2–3.3eV for anatase TiO2 [19,21] and 3.0–3.1eV for rutile TiO2 [20,21]. In our samples, the phase composition did not change by the loading of NiO x and the calcination at temperatures of 250°C and 450°C (Table 1). Therefore, the decrease in the band gap observed should result from the formation of NiO x and TiO2 junction. This desirable N–P junction was likely to be destroyed after the calcination at a higher temperature of 650°C, at which NiO x changed to NiTiO3 (Fig. 3). The catalysts were further characterized by XPS measurements. Fig. 5 shows Ni2p, Ti2p, and O1s XPS spectra collected with the NiO x unloaded and loaded TiO2 samples calcined at different temperatures. For the unmodified TiO2, the binding energy (BE) values of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 were 458.5eV and 464.5eV, respectively, the difference being 6eV. These peaks may come from anatase TiO2 species and a shoulder peak at 457eV from rutile TiO2 species. The loading of NiO x and the following calcination caused significant changes: the 650°C calcined sample had a peak at a BE of 464eV but no other peaks were detected, in which the surface Ti species should be in a structure different from anatase and rutile TiO2 species. The 450°C calcined sample also had a peak at a similar BE along with a small peak at about 457eV. The latter peak indicated that a small amount of Ti species of rutile structure remained on its surface. The 250°C calcined may be on a way of changing from a mixture of anatase and rutile Ti species to other structures. A similar significant change was observed for O 1s. The NiO x -unloaded TiO2 sample had a peak at 529.5eV while the 450°C and 650°C calcined ones had a peak at a larger BE of 535eV. According to the literature, the BE values of NiO and Ni2O3 are 529.7eV and 531.5eV, respectively. The spectra of Ni 2p were a little noisy but the peaks were detected at 860eV and 865eV. The BE values of Ni 2p3/2 of metallic Ni, NiO, NiAl2O3, and NiWO4 are 852.3eV, 853.3eV, 857.2eV, and 857.6eV, respectively, [17], which are smaller compared to the peaks observed with the NiO x -loaded calcined TiO2 samples. At present, unfortunately, it is difficult to determine the surface Ni–Ti–O structure but it may be assumed that the above-mentioned NiO x –TiO2 junction was formed for the calcined NiO x /TiO2 samples. Very recently Iwaszuki et al. investigated the performance of NiO x -loaded TiO2 catalysts for the photocatalytic degradation of 2-naphthol and p-cresol and discussed their high performance after considering their structural features estimated theoretically by density functional theory simulations [16]. It is assumed that NiO clusters have a strong interaction with the surfaces of anatase and rutile TiO2 through NiOTi bonds and additional NiTi bonds for rutile TiO2. These structural changes caused by NiO loading can reduce the band gap energy. Hence, it can be said that the loading of NiO x onto TiO2 and the following calcination cause the bang gap energy to lower by 2.5eV and this is one of factors responsible for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity in H2 production from glycerol and water. The maximum H2 evolution is obtained with 450°C calcined NiO x /TiO2 sample. However, when the calcination temperature is raised to 650°C, the surface properties (XPS and UV/vis) are similar to those of the 450°C calcined sample but the BET surface area is markedly lowered and so this results in a lower activity. Under the reaction conditions used, the conversion of glycerol was so small that it was difficult to determine its conversion and detect liquid products. These pieces of information may be necessary to make a discussion on reaction mechanisms over NiO x /TiO2 catalysts. A few authors discuss the mechanisms of photocatalytic reforming of glycerol over Pt/TiO2 [5] and CuO x /TiO2 [12]. Daskalaki and Kondarides assume that hydroxyl radicals and other oxidants are photogenerated from water and these oxidize and change organic compounds towards lower molecular weight compounds, eventually to CO2. The photocatalytic reforming of glycerol producing H2 should occur through those reaction processes. Lalitha et al. also assume several processes for the photocatalytic production of H2 from glycerol over CuO x /TiO2 catalysts [12]."
8,Conclusions,"NiO x -loaded TiO2 catalysts are active for the photocatalytic production of H2 from aqueous glycerol solution at 50°C. The activity can remain unchanged in a long time of 12h at least. The catalytic performance of NiO x /TiO2 depends significantly on calcination temperature. The maximum activity can be achieved after the calcination at 450°C. The calcination temperature would influence the formation of n-type (NiO x ) and p-type (TiO2) junction. The calcination at 450°C decreased the band gap energy by 0.58eV with respect to the mother TiO2 material, which was responsible for the improved H2 production. The calcination at a higher temperature of 650°C caused a significant decrease in the surface area, reducing the catalytic performance."
