0,Introduction,"Fish is the most consumed animal protein in the world and is mostly sourced from fish farming [1]. The ability of farming to continue providing the market with more fish depends on intensification of the activity. Similar to other production systems, intensification is linked to stressful conditions and increased susceptibility to new diseases [2–4]. Pathogenic agents in the aquatic environment require the use of commercially available antibiotics [5,6]. However, the frequent use of antibiotics can promote highly resistant pathogens and lead to immunosuppression, destabilization of beneficial gastrointestinal bacteria, and the accumulation of antibiotics in fish muscle tissues and water [7–9]. Public awareness of the risks with antibiotics has led to demands for “green fish”, which are fish reared in an antibiotic-free environment, and has led to less use of antibiotics in aquaculture [10]. Alternative management strategies, such as the use of immunostimulants and natural products, may facilitate resistance to infectious diseases [10–13]. Herbaceous plants show great potential to improve the health of cultivated fish by modulating or stimulating innate (nonspecific) or adaptive (specific) immunity components, in addition to promoting growth performance and nutrient utilization [14–17]. Herbal extracts have recently emerged for complementary and alternative use in aquaculture due to their lower cost, greater safety and efficiency. These products are often included as dietary supplements during management activities that cause stress or during crucial life stages to help fish deter infections from pathogens and maintain good health [18,19]. Herbs of the genus Artemisia are often used in human health and livestock for their anti-tumor [20–23], antifungal [24], anticoagulant [25], antidiabetic [26] and anti-inflammatory [27,28] activities. A. annua is a medicinal plant known for its high biological efficiency and low toxicity [29,30], but knowledge of its benefits for fish remains limited. A. annua is a prophylactic product composed of several secondary metabolites such as coumarins, terpenes, phenolics (flavonoids and tannins), among others [31]. This medicinal plant is the only source of artemisinin, which is recommended by the World Health Organization for treating malaria [32]. In addition, artemisinin drugs have antiparasitic potential and previous research has shown artemisinin to be a potent anticancer agent [33]. Therapeutic baths with ethanol extract of A. annua in concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 mgL−1 showed efficacy in treating monogenetic parasites of juvenile Heterobranchus longifilis [34]. Furthermore, the diet supplemented with whole plant extract of A. annua (20 g kg−1 of feed) in Carassius auratus increased the protective effect against infection by the bacteria A. hydrophila after parasitism by I. multifiliis. However, these authors evaluated only the incidence of infestation and mortality of animals. There is currently no information regarding the action of A. annua on the physiology of farmed fish. Therefore, the dosage and administration of this herbal supplement, as well as the physiological conditions of fish species, must be identified for the effective use of A. annua in aquaculture [35]. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is the second most cultivated fish species in the world [36] and in Brazil, this species has become the most fish over the last decade [37]. Nevertheless, pathogens have shown noteworthy impacts on aquaculture around the world, including losses of approximately 20% of production [38]. Among bacterial pathogens, A. hydrophila is characterized as opportunistic and is found in the water column as well as in the skin, gills and intestinal microbiota of fish. An imbalance in the bacteria-host-environment systems allows this pathogen to cause a disease known as septicemia and may lead to significant economic losses for commercial fish farmers [39,40]. Therefore, it necessary to test the effectiveness of innovative products aimed at improving the immune resistance of Nile tilapia, thereby supporting the growing productivity and sustainability of the aquaculture industry. Thus, the objective of the present study was to test whether dietary supplementation with alcoholic extract of the plant A. annua (patent BR10201902707) improves the health of juvenile Nile tilapia and increases resistance to diseases when fish are challenged with A. hydrophila."
1,Material and methods,
2,Experimental diet preparation,"2.1 Experimental diet preparation Experimental diets were isoproteic and isoenergetic [31% digestible protein, 3.04 Mcal/kg of digestible energy] (Table 1 ) and formulated according to Ref. [41]. The dietary ingredients were ground in a knife mill (Marconi MA340, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil) to obtain a particle size of 0.5 mm, weighed and mixed in a Y-type vertical mixer (Marconi MA201, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil), hydrated with water to obtain 20% moist content, and extruded to obtain 2.5 mm diameter pellets using a laboratory pelletizer (G Paniz MCR22, Caxias do Sul, RS, Brazil). The alcoholic extract of A. annua (ae-Aa) containing artemisinin (24.27%) and deoxy-artemisinin (20.55%) (Patent BR10201902707) was added to the formulated diet at the levels of 0.00, 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50%, totaling four treatments with five replicates per treatment. Diets were dried in a forced-air oven (55 °C for 24 h) (Marconi MA035, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil) and stored in a refrigerator at 5 °C until use."
3,Fish and experimental conditions,"2.2 Fish and experimental conditions Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) juveniles were obtained from a commercial fish farm (Polettini, Mogi Mirim, SP, Brazil) and were acclimated to the experimental system. The fish were fed with a control diet for three weeks before the experiment. The experiment was divided into two phases, of which Phase I consisted of feeding and supplementation and Phase II was the bacterial challenge. 2.2.1 Phase I After the acclimatization period, 240 fish were anesthetized with benzocaine (100 mg L−1), weighed individually (24.33 ± 3.75 g), and randomly distributed in 20 glass aquariums (300 L). The aquariums were set up as a recirculation system (4 L min−1 per aquarium) and included individual valve control, physical and biological filter (1500 L), digitally controlled temperature, and supplementary aeration. The total water volume of the recirculation system was 4800 L and the replacement rate was 80% per hour. The experimental design was completely randomized with four experimental groups (levels of ae-Aa in the diets) with five repetitions (12 fish per repetition/experimental unit). Fish were fed daily and manually until apparent satiation at 8 and 11 a.m. and 1 and 4.30 p.m. for 30 days. Diets were weighed daily before the first and after the last feeding to calculate the amount of diet consumed. Dissolved oxygen (6.10 ± 0.70 mg L−1), temperature (25.00 ± 0.89 °C), and pH (7.20 ± 0.217) were measured daily with a multiparameter probe (U-50, Horiba, Minami-ku, Kyoto, Japan) before the first feeding. Total ammonia (0.16 ± 0.10 mg L−1) was measured weekly using a commercial kit (Hach, Loveland, CO, USA). The aquariums were maintained periodically by siphoning and renewing 20% of the total system volume. All water quality parameters were measured in one aquarium per treatment of the water recirculation system. The values of the water quality parameters found in this study were considered adequate according to Ref. [42]. After 30 days, two fish per experimental unit (10 fish per treatment for a total of 40 fish) were used to obtain blood samples and were slaughtered to collect the livers. Samples were analyzed for hematological and biochemical parameters as described below and to characterize the fish health (condition) before the beginning of Phase II. Fish already sampled did not return to the experimental units. 2.2.2 Phase II All fish remaining from Phase I were challenged with inoculation in the visceral cavity with Aeromona hydrophila (see preparation below) for 24 h and no food was administered during this period. Then, two fish per experimental unit were anesthetized with benzocaine (100 mg L−1) to collect blood and liver samples for the characterization of their condition after the bacterial challenge. The remaining fish from Phase II were observed for 15 days and survival was recorded (%). During this period, the animals of all experimental groups received the control diet (no inclusion of ae-Aa), according to Ref. [43–45]. Water quality conditions were maintained and the tanks were cleaned periodically."
4,Preparation of Aeromonas hydrophila for inoculation,"2.3 Preparation of Aeromonas hydrophila for inoculation The A. hydrophila (KJ561021 LAPOA, Jaboticabal, São Paulo, Brazil) strain was kept in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) medium with glycerol 30% (sterile) at - 80 °C. An aliquot of 20 μL (strain), was inoculated in 5 mL of autoclaved BHI medium and incubated in a bacteriological incubator at 28 °C for 24 h. Then, 700 mL of autoclaved BHI medium was added and the aliquots were incubated again following the same procedure. The bacterial suspension was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was discarded and PBS buffer (0.01 M) was used to wash the pellets twice, and then centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 20 min. The suspension with 1 × 106 CFU/mL−1 according to Ref. [46] was adjusted according to the McFarland Standard and read in a spectrophotometer (SpectronicGenesys 5, Milton Roy Company, PA, USA) (OD600 = 0.845), using PBS buffer (0.01 M). The bacterial suspension was previously determined to cause only infection and no severe mortality, allowing the stimulation of the fish immune system."
5,Hematological parameters,"2.4 Hematological parameters Blood samples in both experimental phases were collected by caudal puncture using a syringe washed with EDTA (3%). The hematocrit (Ht) was determined by the microhematocrit method and samples were processed in a microhematocrit centrifuge (NI 1807 Nova Instruments, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil) for 5 min at 10000 rpm. Hemoglobin (Hb) was determined using the cyanmethemoglobin kit (Labtest Diagnostica, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil). The erythrocyte count (Rt) was performed in a Neubauer chamber after blood dilution in citrate formaldehyde solution (1:200). Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration was also calculated. Total leukocyte, total thrombocytes and differentiation of leukocytes were performed on blood smear stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa-Wright. Differentiation and counting were performed under a microscope using an oil immersion objective (100 x)."
6,Stress parameters,"2.5 Stress parameters The blood was centrifuged, and the plasma was used to determine the glucose concentration as measured by glucose oxidase (Labtest, Sao Paulo, Brazil, code 84), and cortisol concentrations by an immunoenzymatic assay using a commercial kit (DRG International, Inc., USA; Cortisol ELISA - EIA - 1887)."
7,Immunological parameters,"2.6 Immunological parameters Heparinized blood was collected and processed to determine the respiratory burst activity of leukocytes as described in Ref. [47]. This method consists of a colorimetric determination of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the leukocytes respiratory burst, which promotes the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) into a dark blue precipitate inside the phagocyte, referred to as formazan granules. The optical density of the final solution was measured at 540 nm. After extraction of the serum, lysozyme activity was measured as described by Ref. [48], and with partial modifications [49]. Results were expressed in units of serum lysozyme mL−1, where one unit is defined as the amount of sample that triggers a reduction in absorbance of 0.001 min−1 at 450 nm when compared to the control (Micrococcus luteus suspension without serum)."
8,Hepatic oxidative stress biomarkers,"2.7 Hepatic oxidative stress biomarkers Fish were sacrificed by spinal cord transection immediately after blood sampling. Livers were collected and washed with saline solution (0.9% NaCl), dried with filter paper, identified, and stored at −80 °C for further biochemical analyses. For the evaluations of the levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), catalase activity (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), the sampled tissues were weighed and homogenized at 12,000 rpm in phosphate buffer for 30 min. Centrifugation was carried out in a Hermle-Z323K refrigerated centrifuge (Hermle Labortechnik, Germany) and the supernatant was used as the enzyme source. Liver protein was determined according to the Bradford [50] method, adapted for the use of a Dynex MRXTC 250 microplate reader, as described by Ref. [51]. Lipid peroxidation was quantified using the ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange (FOX) method as described by Ref. [52], and CAT activity according to Ref. [53] by the continuous evaluation of the decrease in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration at λ = 240 nm. The GST activity was measured according to Ref. [54], using l-chloro-2.4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as the substrate. Spectrophotometric readings were performed in a SpectronicGenesys 5 (Milton Roy Company, PA, USA) spectrophotometer, and the microplate readings were performed using a Tecan-SNR reader (Sunrise-Basic Tecan, NS 1105003419 Groding, Austria)."
9,Statistical analysis,"2.8 Statistical analysis All data were subjected to tests of normality (Shapiro-Wilk), and the means were subjected to an analysis of variance (Two-way ANOVA). To compare phases and supplementation, a randomized design with a factorial arrangement of 4 × 2, being four treatments (control diet, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5% of ae-Aa) and two sampling times (after the feeding period - Phase I and 24 h after-infection - Phase II) was set up. Means were then compared by the Tukey test with a p-value of <0.05."
10,Ethical statement,"2.9 Ethical statement All procedures involving animals in the present study were performed following ethical principles in animal experimentation and approved by the Ethics in Animal Experimentation Committees (CEUA) of both Embrapa Meio Ambiente in Jaguariúna, SP, Brazil (Protocol no. 003/2016) and Federal University of São Carlos – UFSCar, São Carlos, SP, Brazil (Protocol no. 1518230217)."
11,Results,"Nile tilapia survival after exposure to Aeromonas hydrophila was 88% for the group with no ae-Aa and 96%, 100% and 100% for the fishes that received 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50% of the ae-Aa extract, respectively. The different dietary ae-Aa supplementation levels and the sampling times, before and after A. hydrophila infection, showed no interaction for the majority of the analyzed parameters (P > 0.05), with the percentage of lymphocytes as an exception (P = 0.04). Exposure of the Nile tilapia to the A. hydrophila increased the plasmatic glucose and cortisol for all experimental groups, including the fish that received no ae-Aa (P < 0.001). On the other hand, all the supplementation levels of the ae-Aa decreased (P = 0.02) the Nile tilapia plasmatic glucose when compared to the fish that receive no ae-Aa in both phases (Fig. 1 A). The supplementation levels of 0.25 and 0.5% of the ae-Aa decreased (P = 0.021) plasma cortisol in both phases (Fig. 1B). Exposure of the Nile tilapia to the A. hydrophila increased the RAL (P < 0.001), serum lysozyme concentrations (P = 0.008), total plasma protein (P < 0.001), thrombocytes (P = 0.004), neutrophils (P < 0.001) and monocytes (P = 0.011) counts for all experimental groups, including supplemented fish and fish that received no ae-Aa (Fig. 1; Table 2 ). However, the total number of leukocytes showed no change with exposure to A. hydrophila (P > 0.05). All levels of ae-Aa supplementation increased RAL (P < 0.001; Fig. 1C), serum concentrations of lysozyme (P = 0.045; Fig. 1D), total plasma protein (P = 0.014; Fig. 1E), leukocytes (P < 0.001), thrombocytes (P = 0.009), neutrophils (P = 0.007) and monocytes (P = 0.015) counts (Table 2) in Nile tilapia when compared to fish that received no ae-Aa in both phases. The greatest increase in serum concentrations of lysozyme and total plasma protein was observed in fish that received 0.50% of ae-Aa in both phases. Furthermore, the fish in the group that received 0.25 and 0.50% of ae-Aa had higher counts of leukocytes, thrombocytes, neutrophils and monocytes in the blood when compared to the other treatments in both phases (Table 2). The percentage of lymphocytes as a response for Nile tilapia challenged with A. hydrophila was shown to be influenced by the dietary ae-Aa levels (Table 3 ). Before the bacterial challenge, the treatments with 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5% had a lower number of lymphocytes than the control group (P < 0.001). After the bacterial challenge, all treatments that received ae-Aa had a reduced number of lymphocytes (P < 0.001), and fish groups that were supplemented with higher levels of ae-Aa (0.25 and 0.50%) decreased 80% and 81% when compared to the control. When comparing the Nile tilapia exposed to A. hydrophila to the unexposed group, all the experimental groups presented a decrease of hemoglobin concentrations (P < 0.001) and an increase in the number of erythrocytes (P = 0.002), hematocrit percentage (P < 0.001) and MCHC. When comparing the fish that received the supplement and fish that received no ae-Aa, fishes showed no differences in hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte number, hematocrit percentage and MCHC at any inclusion level (P > 0.05) for both phases(Table 4). The exposure of the Nile tilapia to the A. hydrophila increased the liver LPO for all experimental groups, including supplemented fish and fish that received no ae-Aa (P < 0.001). However, the GST and CAT activities showed no change in fishes exposed to A. hydrophila (P > 0.05). All supplementation levels of the ae-Aa decreased (P = 0.001) the Nile tilapia liver LPO when compared to the fish that received no ae-Aa in both phases (Fig. 2 A). No difference was shown between the levels of ae-Aa when compared to the fish that received no ae-Aa regarding liver activities of GST (Fig. 2B) and CAT (Fig. 2C) in both phases (P > 0.05)."
12,Discussion,"The ae-Aa extract showed potential benefits for the Nile tilapia immune system by promoting better biochemical responses, improving pathogen-resistant and ensuring greater survival when receiving the supplement over the 30 days before exposure to A. hydrophila. Results of the present study corroborate previous research, which reported greater resistance and survival of different fish species that were infected with a variety of bacterial diseases and received a diet enriched with medicinal herbs [55–61]. Supplementation with A. annua plant extract for 45 days showed efficacy for treating goldfish (Carassius auratus) infected with fiction (Ichthyophthirius multifiliis) and increased fish survival [62]. Reviews about the biological activities of the A. annua such as anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and antioxidant improve the importance of investigations of their effects [33]. Recently, the oral administration of A. annua whole plants and their compounds have been reported for goldfish (Carassius auratus) [62]. However, the present study is the first to describe the physiological benefits of administrating the ae-Aa for the Nile tilapia for 30 days prior to exposure to A. hydrophila. Fish in artificial rearing conditions are constantly subjected to stressors, resulting in a physiological cascade of events that helps the organism to react and hopefully recover or cope with stressors [63]. Hence, quantifying stressors of fish during aquaculture activities is critical to establish proper management practices [64]. More specifically, strategies that reinforce the immune system to improve physiological responses during stress may improve fish performance by avoiding mortalities, and consequently mitigate economic losses and environmental impacts from the use of antibiotics. Plasmatic cortisol and glucose are among the most commonly used indicators for fish stress [65–67]. The plasmatic concentrations of erythrocytes and hemoglobin are also useful stress indicators that reflect the capacity of blood to transport oxygen to tissues supplying the energetic needs of fish in an adverse situation [68]. In the present study, Nile tilapia showed increases in the plasmatic concentrations of glucose, cortisol, erythrocyte, and hemoglobin after being challenged, indicating that the fish were experiencing stress. It is noteworthy that the supplementation with ae-Aa reduced the plasmatic concentration of glucose and cortisol of the tilapia for both experimental Phases when compared with the group that received no supplement, suggesting the potential of ae-Aa to reduce negative effects from stress. Recent studies have shown that a variety of plants are rich in secondary metabolites that may induce immunomodulatory activities during stress [10]. Nevertheless, plant supplements in aquaculture should be developed to support both innate and adaptive components of the immune system, to prevent infections rather than acting as a treatment after an outbreak [69]. The decrease in the plasma glucose and cortisol levels and the increase of the innate immunological indicators of the Nile tilapia in the present study suggest that supplementation with ae-Aa extract for 30 days prior to exposure to A. hydrophila improved the immune response in fish. Nile tilapia supplemented with ae-Aa showed improved immunological parameters, such as serum lysozyme activity, total plasma protein and RAL when compared to fish that received no supplement. In addition, supplementation with ae-Aa increased the presence of leukocytes and thrombocytes in the blood, which may increase the resistance of fish to stress. An increase in total plasma protein indicates better immunity, as lysozyme and complementary factors represent a fraction of the total plasma protein [54]. Little or no results were found using A. annua to evaluate immune responses of fish. On the other hand, benefits of A. annua on the immune system of broilers include resistance to deleterious effects of thermal stress and increases in cellular and humoral immunity [70,71]. Therefore, the supplementation of ae-Aa for tilapia during 30 days before infection with A. hydrofila activated the fish immune system and strengthened the immune response, indicating the efficiency of the ae-Aa extract as an immunostimulant. Several natural immunostimulants known as immunomodulators, immune restorers, immunoadjuvants, or biological response modifiers can normalize or modulate physiological processes [10,72]. Herbal extracts have nonspecific immunostimulatory effects on humans and animals [73] and have shown different actions on the immune system. In fish, the biological activity of herbal immunostimulants occurs through the modulation or stimulation of innate (nonspecific) or adaptive (specific) immune components, facilitating phagocytosis and bacterial death through macrophages, lymphocytes, complement pathways, and innate cytotoxic cells, resulting in greater resistance to disease and protection from pathogens [10,74–77]. Immunostimulants can inhibit the generation of oxidative anions and eliminate free radicals [78–81], improving cellular defenses and inhibiting oxidative damage to cellular components. Herbal compounds can also inhibit the generation of oxidative anions and eliminate free radicals [82], and can be used to mitigate impacts from stressors [83]. The A. annua is among the medicinal plants with the highest oxygen radical absorption capacity (ORAC), which gives it a high antioxidant activity [31,84]. In the present study, liver damage as related to oxidative stress induced by the ae-Aa supplementation was evaluated by measuring LPO and GST and CAT activities. The reduction in LPO levels in the Nile tilapia that received the ae-Aa suggests lower oxidative stress. Even with the increased hepatic LPO observed in all experimental groups exposed to the A. hydrophila, the fishes that were fed with ae-Aa prior to infection presented lower levels of hepatic LPO when compared to the fish that received no supplement. Thus, supplementation of Nile tilapia with ae-Aa showed efficacy in avoiding the oxidative stress of fish when challenged with A. hydrophila. In conclusion, results of the present study demonstrate the benefits of supplementing the Nile tilapia with ae-Aa as a strategy to mitigate effects of stress conditions in aquaculture. Nile tilapia fed with 0.5% ae-Aa for 30 days before exposure to Aeromonas hydrophila showed efficiency in modulating innate immunity system, protecting against oxidative stress, and increase in disease resistance. Thus, results of this study provide practical strategies to improve health, bacterial resistance, and in turn the productivity of Nile tilapia in fish farming through the dietary supplementation of ae-Aa. However, the optimal dose of the A. annua must be tested on fish when subjected to other stress conditions, on different species and in different production systems to elaborate the effective use of ae-Aa as a supplement in aquaculture."
