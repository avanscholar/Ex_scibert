0,Introduction,"Concerns about the depletion of fossil fuels, anthropogenic carbon emission and climate change as well as energy security have led to increasingly interest in developing new alternative routes to meet the energy demand of near future in more efficient and environmentally benign manner [1,2]. Hydrogen has the highest energy content (120MJ/Kg) compared to conventional fuels [3] and its sole combustion product is water; hence hydrogen is a powerful and clean energy carrier. On the other hand, biomass is known as renewable source of energy and carbon dioxide neutral in its life cycle, as CO2 could be fixed by photosynthesis during biomass growth which will result in net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions [4]. According to these facts, biomass-based hydrogen could be a correspondent solution for sustainable development. Reviews on present scenarios, future prospects and recent advances in hydrogen from biomass have recently clarified the path. Balat and Kirtay [5] concluded that biomass gasification offers the earliest and most economical route for the production of renewable hydrogen. Due to its environmental merits, the share of hydrogen from biomass in the automotive fuel market will grow fast in the next decade. In another study, Kirtay [6] reviewed recent advances in biomass-based hydrogen and explained how thermochemical (pyrolysis and gasification) and biological (biophotolysis, photo-fermentation and dark fermentation) processes can be practically applied to produce hydrogen. Nevertheless, there are challenges yet to be addressed which are interestingly discussed in [7,8]. Integration with hydrogen purification and storage systems, corrosion and problems with salts such as poisoning of the heterogeneous catalysts and reactor plugging are some instances. Among thermochemical conversion methods, hydrothermal gasification (HTG) seems to be a promising route to convert waste into energy and has been widely investigated during recent decades [9]. Hydrothermal gasification process utilizes sub- or supercritical water (critical properties of water are Tc =374.1 °C and Pc =22.1MPa) to convert low-quality high-moisture content feedstock (organic effluents or lignocellulosic wastes) into biorenewable hydrogen-rich gas. Hydrothermal gasification is a reliable approach due to its carbon-neutral inherence and capability of using multifarious feedstock [10,11]. Thermo-physical properties of water encounter radical changes close to its critical point. Its low viscosity and high heat capacity provides a proper reaction media. Moreover, hydrothermal water has high diffusivity and other improved transport properties which result in faster reaction rates. High solubility and low dielectric constant of hydrothermal water also provides dissolution of many organic compounds that leads to further increase in reaction rates and reduce tarry products. In addition, due to increased self-dissociation of water near and above critical point, H3O+ and OH− ions behave as catalytic precursors for acidic or basic reactions [1,2,12]. Given the fact that the exact reaction pathway of biomass/organic materials in hydrothermal water has not been yet determined, it is widely accepted to consider reforming, water-gas shift (WGS), CO and CO2 methanation to represent the overall mechanism by Eqs. (1)–(4), respectively [9,13,14]. (1) CHxOy +(1−y) H2O→CO+(1−y+x/2) H2, ΔH>0 (2) CO+H2O↔CO2 +H2, ΔH=−41kJ/mol (3) CO+3H2 ↔CH4 +H2O, ΔH=−206kJ/mol (4) CO2 +4H2 ↔CH4 +2H2O, ΔH=−165kJ/mol To date, extensive investigations have been conducted to assess hydrothermal gasification of real biomass including agricultural residues, food refuse, aquatic plants and microalgae species [15,16], as well as representative model compounds such as cellulose, glucose and glycerol [17,18]. Less effort has been devoted to explore industrial wastewater potential for utilization in HTG, including organic waste of coal dewatering [19], polyvinyl alcohol contaminated wastewater [20], polyethylene glycol contaminated wastewater [21], olive mill wastewater [22], domestic wastewater [23] and recently oily wastewater [24]. To operate HTG process at milder temperatures and to increase the hydrogen fraction in gaseous product, many researchers have exploited variety of catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts used for HTG could be categorized into (1) carbon-based types, (2) metals/metal oxides with support and (3) metals/metal oxides without support. Comprehensive reviews on catalytic sub- and supercritical water gasification can be found in [25–27]. Several studies have focused on transition metals such as Ni, Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd, Co, Zr, Mo and W to catalyze WGS reaction to increase H2 at the expense of CO. Based on literature, Ni and Ru are the most frequently catalysts used in HTG. Ru has exhibited high stability and activity for gasification of alkylphenols and lignin in SCW [28], and RuO2 was excellent for complete decomposition and gasification of stable aromatic compounds [10]. Besides, high cost and limited availability of nobel metals may limit their further development [29]. Nickel promotes WGS and methanation reactions [30] and is more cost effective that nobel metals, but may result in low H2 yield [10] and lose its activity during hydrothermal processes [28,31]. Copper is cheaper than Ni or Rh and offers high efficiency in promoting WGS in subcritical environment, while cobalt is more effective in catalyzing hydrodeoxygenation reactions [28,32]. In addition, cobalt was found to show a similar catalytic activity as noble metals in regard to CC bond cleavage, even at low operating temperatures [33]. In this work, we investigated hydrothermal gasification of three different industrial waste streams (distillery, oil refinery and petrochemical complex) with reaction time between 15–45min. Transition metal oxide catalysts (MnO2, CuO and Co3O4) with various catalyst loadings (20, 40 and 60wt%) were used for catalytic experiments. Moreover, effects of temperature (300, 325, 350 and 375°C) and reaction time (15–30–45min) on hydrogen production were studied over the best catalyst type and the optimum catalyst loading. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper concerning hydrothermal gasification of petrochemical and oil refinery effluents and comparing them with a high-strength beet-based distillery wastewater. Also, no previous study was found to assess the effects of metal oxides catalysts utilized in this work for such process. A summary of previous researches on hydrothermal gasification of wastes and wastewaters with transition metal catalysts is presented in Table 1 ."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and feed characterization,"2.1 Materials and feed characterization Three specifically chosen samples of real industrial effluents were obtained directly from their origins and used as received. Distillery wastewater (Dis-W) was provided by a local beet-based ethanol manufacturer, oily wastewater (Oil-W) was collected from lubricating-oil production unit of an oil refinery plant and petrochemical wastewater (Pet-W) was supplied from a reputable petrochemical complex. Elemental analysis (dry base), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), COD and TOC measurements were performed on the received feedstock as required. Detailed characteristics of the received wastewater samples are listed in Table 2 . The wastewater samples were diluted as needed with deionized water in order to prepare 30wt% solutions for experiments. Transition metal oxide catalysts including MnO2, CuO and Co3O4 were also obtained from Merck in form of ultra fine powders and used without further processing. Qualitative determination of major organic compounds present in wastewater samples was performed by a gas chromatograph (GC- Agilent Technology) coupled with a mass spectrometer (MS- 5973 Network Mass Selective Detector). The organic fractions were separated on an HP-5 capillary column (30m length, 0.25mm I.D., 0.25 micrometer film thickness), using helium as the carrier gas. The initial oven temperature was 50°C, held for 1min and then raised to 250°C with 10°C/min ramp. Injection port and detector temperatures were 250 and 230°C, respectively. The results of GS/MS analyses are presented in Table 3 ."
3,Experimental apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Experimental apparatus and procedure Catalytic hydrothermal gasification of industrial wastewaters was carried out in a high-pressure stainless steel 316L batch autoclave. The reactor assembly allowed for sampling of both gas and liquid. Details about the experimental setup, as well as its schematic were presented in previous study [38]. Table 4 lists important specifications and technical features of the apparatus utilized in this work. In a typical experiment, 90mL of 30wt% feedstock solution along with the desired amount of catalyst was loaded into the reactor, which was tightly sealed by spiral-wound gaskets. The air in the overhead was purged by five repeated cycles of pressurized nitrogen injection and evacuation. The reactor was then heated by a 1kW electrical furnace to the desired reaction temperature. After the desired reaction time elapsed, the furnace was removed and the reactor was cool down to 200°C by natural convection and subsequently to 30°C by air fan. Forced convection was not applied from the beginning of cooling period to prevent reducing the reactor life time. This procedure was kept identical for all runs. Temperature and pressure behaviors of the reactor are presented in Fig. 1 , corresponding to heating, reaction and cooling periods of catalytic experiments for 30min at 350°C. Gaseous product was then collected through a sampling valve in a gas bag for composition analysis by GC and then the reactor was disassembled from the setup for separation and measurements of the liquid and solid phases. The liquid-solid mixture of each run was completely collected and separated by vacuum suction through filter paper (Whatman®, pore size of 2.5μm) for 10min. The solid residue on filter was dried in an oven at 105°C and weighed after 24h. The solid residue was comprised of char, spent catalyst and ash (originated from the wastewater). The amount of catalyst used for each experiment was known; also, the ash content was given by TGA analysis. Hence, the total mass of metal catalyst and ash was deduced from the solid phase weight and the remaining carbonaceous residue was taken as char. The volume of the recovered liquid was also measured and recorded to calculate the reactor head-space volume. The detailed description is explained in Section 2.4."
4,Analyses,"2.3 Analyses The gaseous product from each run was immediately collected into an initially evacuated gas bag (Tedlar-SKC) and then sampled by using a gas-tight syringe for gas analysis injection. Gas analysis was carried out with a gas chromatograph (Young Lin Acme 6100 GC) equipped with two Agilent 19095Q-P04 packed columns in series with a 5Å Agilent molecular sieve column and a helium ion detector (HID) to determine H2, CH4, CO, CO2, N2 and O2 mole fractions. Ultra pure helium was utilized as the carrier gas with flow rate and pressure of 28ml/min and 6.4 psig, respectively. The oven and the HID detector temperatures were maintained at 35°C and 280°C, respectively. A standard gas mixture was used to calibrate the GC analyses before each run. As the nitrogen in gaseous product was originated from air purging before heating, N2 was omitted from produced gas calculation and other mole fractions were normalized."
5,Data interpretation,"2.4 Data interpretation Gas product (GP), gas yield (GY), gasification efficiency (GE) and hydrogen production (HP) were considered as indicators to appraisement the hydrothermal gasification process, which are described by Eqs. (5)–(8). (5) G P ( m m o l ) = P . V R . T (6) G Y ( m m o l / g r ) = moles of each spieces in produced gas mass o f ash − free dry matter in feed (7) G E ( % ) = mass of produced gas mass of ash-free dry matter in feed × 100 (8) H P ( m m o l ) = P . V R . T × y H 2 The amount of gas product was calculated using temperature, pressure and head-space volume of the reactor after cooling to ambient conditions, according to ideal gas rule. The head-space volume was considered as the difference between the total inner reactor chamber and the effluent liquid volumes. Gas composition from gas chromatography, as well as, TGA results were also used to calculate other indicators. We note that, although the reproducibility of our experimental system was confirmed in previous work [38], catalytic experiments were conducted in replication to assure that the overall error was less than 10%. All reported values in this manuscript are the average of replicated measurements."
6,Results and discussion,"In this research, hydrothermal gasification (HTG) of three different industrial waste streams (distillery, oil refinery and petrochemical complex) is investigated in an autoclave batch reactor with reaction time of 15, 30 and 45min. According to the obtained gas products and hydrogen yields, the best choice was subjected to catalytic HTG over transition metal oxide catalysts (MnO2, CuO and Co3O4) with various catalyst loadings (20, 40 and 60wt%). Catalyst loading refers to mass of catalyst over mass of dry ash-free (DAF) feed. Finally, effects of temperature (300, 325, 350 and 375°C) and reaction time (15, 30 and 45min) on hydrogen production were studied over the best catalyst type and the optimum catalyst loading. The summary of experimental conditions is presented in Table 5 . In this section, gasification profiles depending on operating parameters and catalytic activity of catalysts are comparatively discussed in terms of GP, GY, GE and HP. Solid phase product is also explored according to char quantification."
7,Effect of feedstock type,"3.1 Effect of feedstock type In this section, we evaluated the gasification profile and hydrogen generation potential of three types of well-known industrial wastewaters. Experiments were conducted at 350°C without catalyst in reaction time varying from 15 to 30 and 45min. Fig. 2 illustrates the gaseous product compositions and their variation by reaction time. It was found that hydrogen mole fraction obtained from Dis-W was considerably lower than those attained by gasification of Oil-W and Pet-W. Maximum H2 mole fraction in Dis-W experiments was 16.9%, whereas it reached up to 39.4% and 56.2% in Pet-W and Oil-W, respectively. These behaviors suggest that WGS reaction may face constraints in Dis-W, compared to other wastewaters. This could be attributed to the dominant progression of CO bonds cleavage with respect to CC bonds, which results in more production of heavier molecules (organic acids and alcohols) than synthesis gas via WGS and methanation reactions [12]. It was also observed that variation of hydrogen mole fraction in gaseous product with reaction time had completely different trends and sensitivities for each wastewater. In all cases, the most significant change in gaseous composition occurred between 15–30min and the effect of time was less pronounced afterward. For Dis-W, increasing reaction time from 15 to 30min resulted in reduction of H2 fraction from 16.9% to 10.9%, followed by a recovery to 14.6% after 45min. Whereas, H2 fraction in Oil-W experiments decreased continuously from 56.2% to 32.9 over 15–45min time span. This is likely due to enhancement of methanation reactions and is in accordance with the results obtained by subcritical water gasification of glucose between15 to 60min [39]. Comparison of the results obtained from Dis-W with glucose gasification comes from the fact that major intermediates of glucose hydrolysis are acids and aldehydes. Moreover, according to previous studies [40–42] hydrogen is generated by gasification of short-chained intermediates like acids and aldehydes, etc, which are the main ingredients of Dis-W used in this study (Table 3). Conversely, Pet-W experienced a significant improvement in hydrogen fraction at longer reaction time, from 16.1% at 15min to 39.4 at 45min. This could be explained by higher reforming rate compared to WGS to produce more hydrogen and, at the same time, occurrence of CO2 methanation (Eq. (4)) to remove CO2 from reaction media. The same results were achieved by SCWG of 2-propanol [12]. The comparison is again due to the fact that more than 70% of Pet-W belongs to esters and light alkanes (Table 3), which are intermediates of syngas production, as well as alcohols. Effect of feedstock type on gas product (GP) is comparatively depicted in Fig. 3 . It is shown that Dis-W generated much more gaseous product compared to other types of wastewater, which may be referred to higher TOC level in Dis-W; as the TOC is an indirect indicant of organic compounds in solution. As it was expected, GP increased by prolonging the residence time, except for Oil-W which represented a decreasing trend over time. GP of Oil-W was 1.7mmol at 15min but reduced to lower than 0.5mmol afterward. GP of Pet-W could eventually reach to only 0.9mmol. In contract, HTG of Dis-W resulted in high amount of 5.3mmol at 15min and increased to 7.1 and 7.3mmol after 30 and 45min, respectively. Decreasing of GP for Oil-W may be attributed to the fact that phenolic compounds had gone through condensation reactions to produce heavier molecules which are hard-to-gasify and hence remained in liquid phase. According to Table 3, phenols and phenyls possess more than 20% and 31% of Oil-W, respectively. Reaction time influence on GP appears to diminish at longer time periods (Fig. 3), alike its effect on hydrogen mole fraction (Fig. 2). According to Fig. 2, Oil-W gasification resulted in the highest hydrogen mole fraction in gaseous product, while Dis-W yielded considerably higher amount of gas (Fig. 3). Hence, the net amount of hydrogen production (HP) had to be evaluated in order to find the potential feedstock for catalytic gasification. Fig. 4 clearly highlights that HP profiles were similar to GP, qualitatively. In other words, despite the low hydrogen mole fraction in gas product, high capacity of Dis-W in gasification makes it a great potential for further investigations, where HP increased from 0.89mmol in 15min to 1.07mmol in 45min. Moreover, HP obtained from Dis-W was less sensitive to reaction time and supplied high amount of hydrogen in comparison with other wastewaters. Although, HP from HTG of Oil-W was high enough in 15min (0.96mmol) to compete with Dis-W, its dramatic fall to 0.17mmol in 30min suggests unreliable behavior for process scale-up and would be a limiting factor for reactor design. In the case of Pet-W, increasing trend of HP by reaction time is favorable for gasification but could not exceed 0.36mmol, which is far less than Dis-W results. According to the above mentioned findings, distillery wastewater was determined as a proper choice for catalytic hydrothermal gasification in further experiments."
8,Effect of catalyst type and loading,"3.2 Effect of catalyst type and loading Investigating the synergistic or inhibitory effects of transition metal oxide catalysts on hydrogen production is the primary interest of this section. To this regard, MnO2, CuO and Co3O4 were used as catalysts in experiments. Moreover, for better assessment of gasification activities, results were perused in terms of gas yield (GY) and gasification efficiency (GE). Based on elemental analysis, the empirical formula of ash-free dry matter in Dis-W was found to be C0.2511 H0.4265 O0.2925 N0.0298. Moreover, according to thermogravimetric analysis and the water content in distillery wastewater, 90mL solution (30wt%) corresponded to the water density of 0.55 gr.cm−3 in the reactor during gasification conditions. Effects of different catalysts with various loadings on HTG of Dis-W and comparison of the results with catalyst-free run are depicted in Fig. 5 . It is clear that catalyst addition has resulted in increase of H2 yield and decrease of CO and CO2 yields in all cases. Slight rise in CH4 yield was also observed. All this issues are delectable for gasification, to obtain a high energy-content gas product from a low-quality waste. Lower amount of CO in catalytic experiment suggests that progression of WGS reaction is higher in the presence of catalyst. Similar findings were reported by [31,43]. Increasing MnO2 loading from 20 to 60wt% improved the hydrogen yield (HY) from 0.58 to 0.75mmolgr−1, continuously. As the non-catalytic gasification resulted in HY of 0.46mmolgr−1, slight gasification enhancement was achieved by MnO2 and HY variation was not remarkable. In addition, more catalyst loading caused higher CO yields, implying that MnO2 has an inhibitory effect on WGS reaction. Similar HY trend with higher improvement rate was observed by adding CuO, as hydrogen yield could eventually reach 1.11mmolgr−1 by 60wt% of catalyst. Higher CO2 yield was accompanied by lower CO yield, implying that CuO could catalyze WGS reaction. Effect of Co3O4 on HY was much notable than MnO2 and CuO, however the trend was not monotonic. Hydrogen yield was improved by addition of Co3O4 and reached the highest level at 40wt% (1.25mmolgr−1) and then gradually declined by 60wt% (1.07mmolgr−1). It is important to determine whether the improvement in catalytic HTG was due to production of hydrogen-richer gas or higher amount of gaseous product. To this end, Fig. 6 compares the hydrogen mole fractions of catalytic tests against catalyst loading and Fig. 7 represents the corresponding gasification efficiencies. As it can be seen in Fig. 6, variation of MnO2 loading had not considerable effect on H2 mol% and maintained it about 17–19%; while CuO loading increment linearly increased H2% from 17% to 26%. The trend differs for Co3O4, where 20wt% of catalyst raised H2 fraction from 11% (in non-catalytic run) to 23% and proceeded to 26% with 40wt%. Hydrogen fraction did not exceed this value with higher amount of catalyst and decreased slightly at 60wt%. This behavior shows that catalyst may be in excess amount in reaction media. Onwudili and Williams [44] also gasified bio-oil in SCW and observed that hydrogen fraction in gaseous product decreased by increasing the RuO2/Alumina from 5 to 10wt%. Fig. 7 demonstrates that gasification efficiency (GE) had revealed different trend from those of H2 mole fraction. MnO2 had inhibitory effect on GE with respect to blank (non-catalytic) test and even though higher amount of catalyst could steadily recover the GE, maximum catalytic efficiency could finally reach the blank test value (∼13%). The same behavior was observed when 20wt% CuO was used, but catalytic activity of 40wt% loading raised the GE to a higher level (∼14%) and then leveled off. Among the studied catalyst, Co3O4 was beneficial at all weight percentages compared to blank test. Moreover, 40wt% loading of Co3O4 was recognized as the optimum value for GE enhancement. Cobalt was known to have a low activity for the water-gas shift reaction in comparison to nickel and ruthenium [2], but more recently, cobalt was found to provide similar activity to noble metal catalysts in cleaving of CC bonds, even at low temperatures [33]. In contrast, Zhang et al. [28] concluded that Cu has low activity for the cleavage of CC bonds in SCW, but it is effective in catalyzing the water gas shift reaction. Based on Figs. 5–7, it was concluded that MnO2 was unable to enhance the gasification efficiency and its positive effect on H2 mole fraction was unremarkable. CuO had moderate activity for HTG and could not reach the desirable results represented by Co3O4. These results suggest that Co3O4 loading of 40wt% is the optimum choice to gain the maximum attainable hydrogen from Dis-W and the order of catalytic activity for both GE and H2 mole fraction was as follow: Co3O4 >CuO>MnO2."
9,Effect of temperature on catalytic HTG,"3.3 Effect of temperature on catalytic HTG With the aim of maximum hydrogen production, four different temperatures approaching critical point of water were considered: 300, 325, 350 and 375°C. These values were chosen in such a way that gasification activity and hydrogen production below 300°C is very low and not of interest, according to the literature [19,38]. Experiments were performed with Dis-W and Co3O4 with the optimum loading (40wt%) for 30min. Effect of temperature on GE and GYs is displayed in Fig. 8 . As expected, increasing temperature was in favor of GE, insofar as 16% efficiency was achieved at the highest temperature. The reason is that higher temperature results in higher reaction rates, improved transport properties and progression of reforming as an endothermic reaction (Eq. (1)). The trend is in good agreement with findings of Azadi et al. [32] on gasification of cellulose over transition metal catalysts. Increasing temperature also facilitated hydrogen production, as the upward trend of hydrogen yield was gradual from 300 to 350°C, but experienced a sharp rise from 2.13 to 6.69mmolgr−1 at 375°C (about threefold increment). During hydrothermal decomposition, large molecules of wastewater are hydrolyzed into smaller intermediates and gasified into gaseous products, mainly due to the cleavage of CC and CO bonds and reacting with OH− and H3O+ ions. This mechanism supports the formation of H2 through reforming and WGS reactions which are accelerated at higher temperatures. Similar discussions are reported by [1,2]. In addition, CO yield was reduced while CH4 yield increased at 375°C, implying that gaseous product had higher heating value. This implies that CH4 was formed by hydrogenation of CO bond cleavage products via catalytic progression of methanation reaction (Eq. (3)). Anticipation of catalyst behavior at higher temperatures (in supercritical region) may be also of interest, as the increasing trend of H2 production peaked at critical point. The reaction chemistry in supercritical region differs from that of subcritical conditions. Gasification in SCW progresses in single phase reaction media, with enhanced transport properties and high miscibility of organic compound, as opposed to subcritical water. An interesting investigation has been performed by Boucard et al. [45], who compared sub- and supercritical water gasification of black liquor using either or not CeO2 catalyst. They concluded that under subcritical conditions, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation is favored, whereas, in supercritical region, capping reaction is predominant. Moreover, enhancing water splitting into active hydrogen and oxygen species at higher temperatures facilitates the formation of H2 molecules and oxidizing organic compounds, respectively."
10,Effect of reaction time on catalytic HTG,"3.4 Effect of reaction time on catalytic HTG Hydrothermal gasification of Dis-W over Co3O4 at 350°C was investigated for three reaction times (15, 30 and 45min) to verify the time dependency of catalytic profile. Fig. 9 points out that reaction time had a swing effect on both GE and hydrogen yield. As holding time increased from 15 to 30min, GE dropped from 17% to 15%; but prolonging of time to 45min recovered GE to more than 20%. The same trend was perceived for hydrogen yield, where it was reduced from 3.08 to 1.25 and then soared to 4.72mmolgr−1 (for 15, 30 and 45min, respectively). It is plausible that prolonging reaction time from 15 to 30min has reversed WGS reaction to produce CO at the expense of CO2 and H2. Increased amount of CO and lower yields of CO2 and H2 support this explanation. Shirai et al. [36] found the same results by HTG of ethanol production waste. A slight increase in CH4 yield was also observed, which may suggest that longer time provided more opportunity for CO2 methanation reaction (Eq. (4)) to consume hydrogen. Higher hydrogen yield and GE obtained by extending the holding time to 45min might be attributed to hydrolysis of more intermediates and consequently progression of reforming reaction (Eq. (1)) to produce more gaseous components. This is in agreement with the recent results by Cherad et al. [11]. Comparison of Figs. 8 and 9 shows that effect of reaction time was less pronounced than temperature influence. This was also previously reported by Youssef et al. [1] who gasified catechol and starch over TiO2 catalyst in SCW."
11,Comparison with previous work,"3.5 Comparison with previous work This section seeks to clarify the contribution of catalyst in enhancement of gasification and hydrogen production, by comparing the results with those of non-catalytic data from our previous work [38]. HP, GE and H2 mole fraction are comparatively discussed for various temperatures and reaction times in Figs. 10 and 11 . Comparison of the results in Fig. 10 reveals that HP, GE and H2 mol% at catalytic conditions were higher than those obtained in non-catalytic tests at all operating temperatures and interestingly the trends are consistent. Catalyst had a great effect on hydrogen mole fraction in gas product, as solid line (catalytic) is well apart from dashed line (non-catalytic) between 300 and 350°C. In this temperature range, average H2 mol% in catalytic runs was approximately 15% higher than that of non-catalytic; but this difference tends to fade near critical point, where catalyst could only increase the H2% from 48% to 52%. Similar trend was observed for GE, where catalyst contribution in improvement of gasification efficiency faded at higher temperatures (red lines in Fig. 10). Taking into consideration of these findings reveals that hydrogen production needs catalytic pathway at lower temperatures. Column chart in Fig. 10 supports this idea that catalyst effectiveness starts to diminish while reaching critical point. Fig. 11 clearly highlights that the decreasing-increasing effect of reaction time on HP and H2% was also observed in non-catalytic experiments and Co3O4 has just intensified it catalytically. It is also inferable that at constant temperature, catalyst possesses a considerable effect on HTG process and its effectiveness is much pronounced at longer reaction time; as HP was significantly increased from 1.07 to 8.06mmolgr−1 by adding 40wt% Co3O4 as catalyst. Considering catalytic and non-catalytic GE curves in Fig. 11 makes it clear that reduction of HP at 30min experiments was not attributed to gasification efficiency, rather it was due to considerable decline in hydrogen mole fraction."
12,Solid observation,"3.6 Solid observation As discussed in Section 2.2, solid phase product was filtered, dried and weighed after each run and the remaining solid cake was taken as char after deducting the mass of ash content and catalyst metals. Fig. 12 exhibits the amounts of char resulted from different experiments. Fig. 12(A) revealed that the addition of catalyst decreased char formation at subcritical region and reduction of char continued with catalyst loading increment. A possible explanation is that catalyst addition facilitates carbon transformation into gaseous and liquid phases, as well as inhibiting condensation reactions to form heavier molecules. Another salience was that char inhibition was less sensitive to catalyst type, unless the catalyst loadings reached 60wt%, where Co3O4 possessed the best performance. Dashed line in Fig. 12(B) compares char formation of non-catalytic conditions with catalytic results (column charts) over various temperatures. Increasing trend of char content over temperature was observed at both catalytic and non-catalytic conditions, which may be referred to progression of polymerization reactions of tarry products into char at higher temperatures. According to Table 3, Dis-W is mainly comprised of acids and esters, which are known to form insoluble heavy fragments and char through condensation and cross-linking reactions [42]. The interesting finding was that catalyst could reduce the char formation up to 70% at low temperatures, as opposed to critical point, where solid residue was higher in catalytic run and soared to 788mg. This behavior suggests that catalytic mechanism for char inhibition may not be sufficient in supercritical conditions. Boucard et al. [45] assessed the sub- and supercritical gasification in terms of both gaseous product and coke formation. They clearly proved that coke formation was increased in supercritical region, where radical reactions dominate ionic pathway and consequently high level of condensation reactions is expected. One solution for char/coke inhibition may be probably rapid heating of reactor to prevent the formation of heavier components in low temperature region [35]. Another alternative was introduced by Zhang et al. [9] who concluded that by appropriate catalyst selection, CC bond cleavage was more favorable than condensation reactions and consequently more gas will be produced at the expense of char. Reaction time had also a positive influence on char abatement in hydrothermal gasification. Fig. 12(C) notifies that char reduction improves with reaction time in presence of catalyst. It should be noted that, quantification of carbonaceous products may be of much interest in the case of heterogeneous catalysts, supported on porous media, as the catalytic activity is highly affected by coking and blockage due to char formation."
13,Reaction pathway,"3.7 Reaction pathway Decomposition of feedstock components takes place by hydrolysis and dehydrogenation to form water soluble intermediates and further degradation through CC bonds cleavage results in production of short-chain organics, like acids and aldehydes, and finally to gaseous products via WGS and methanation reactions. In parallel, cleaving of CO bonds gives other organic acids and alcohols, as the promoters of condensation reactions and char formation [12,43,44]. Moreover, organic acids and alcohols have different gasification behaviors at hydrothermal water. Chakinala et al. [46] studied the effect of chain length and molecular structure on gasification efficiency and provided several reaction schemes for acids and alcohols decomposition in SCW. Furthermore, dehydration of feed at subcritical region may lead to production of furfural and phenolic compounds, which may be subjected to further dehydration or condensation reactions to form tarry products. In addition, polymerization and cross-linking reactions between phenols/aldehydes gives hard-to-gasify products and char [9,28,42]. Catalysts may interfere these reactive steps in various ways. As mentioned above, tendency of catalyst to cleave CC or CO bonds will change the reaction route. Capability of water splitting is also another influential factor on reactivity of mixture. Based on literature survey and taking into consideration the above mentioned findings, a primary reaction route for hydrothermal gasification is postulated as Fig. 13 ."
14,Conclusions,"In this research, hydrothermal gasification of three different industrial waste streams (distillery, oil refinery and petrochemical complex) was investigated in an autoclave with reaction time of 15, 30 and 45min. According to gas products and hydrogen yields, distillery wastewater exhibited a great potential for hydrogen production, hence it was subjected to catalytic experiments over transition metal oxide catalysts (MnO2, CuO and Co3O4) with various catalyst loadings (20, 40 and 60wt%). It was concluded that MnO2 was unable to enhance the gasification efficiency and its positive effect on H2 mole fraction was not remarkable. CuO had moderate activity for gasification of distillery wastewater and could not reach the desirable results represented by Co3O4. According to both gasification efficiency and H2 mole fraction, it was determined that the order of catalytic activity was as Co3O4 >CuO>MnO2 and 40wt% loading of Co3O4 was the optimum value to gain the maximum attainable hydrogen from distillery wastewater. Moreover, effects of temperature (300, 325, 350 and 375°C) and reaction time (15, 30, 45min) on hydrogen production through distillery wastewater were studied over 40wt% loading of Co3O4. The results showed that high temperature was favorable for both gasification efficiency and hydrogen yield. Reaction time possessed a swing effect on distillery wastewater gasification but the final conclusion was that the highest amount of hydrogen could be obtained at the longest reaction time. Comparison of catalytic and non-catalytic results revealed that hydrogen production needs to be catalytically enhanced at lower temperatures, as the catalyst effectiveness tends to fade while reaching critical point. It was also found that catalyst effectiveness is much pronounced at longer reaction time. Char formation was significantly inhibited by the addition of catalyst at subcritical region, implying that CC bond cleavage was enhanced by exploited catalysts. Conversely, char formation in catalytic run was increased at critical point, suggesting further investigation is required to find favorable catalyst for supercritical zone, from the char inhibition point of view. Catalyst deactivation, reactor plugging, pore blockage and separation difficulties, as the main consequences of coke/char formation at high temperatures, are yet to be explored. These issues, as well as reaction pathway tuning for more detectable product, are interesting areas of research and presumed to be obviated by improved catalyst development."
