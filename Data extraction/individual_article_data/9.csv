0,Introduction,"The production of building-block chemicals as well as of fuels using renewable energy sources is critical for a complete independence of fossil fuels [1]. Moreover, from a green chemistry perspective, new and economically efficient processes that do not rely on the use or formation of toxic and hazardous materials are becoming very important. Carbonyl compounds, which represent an important and versatile platform for fine chemicals synthesis in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, are experiencing a continuously increasing global demand [2–4]. Consequently, vast research efforts have been devoted to efficiently and selectively oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones [5]. However, traditional chemical oxidation of alcohol to aldehydes or ketones typically relies on stoichiometric or excess chemical oxidants that could include transition metals, hyper-valent iodine reagents, activated sulfur transformations [6,7] or noble metal catalysts in harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature and large O2 pressure, which incidentally lead to safety and ecological issues [8]. In this context, the development of green, mild, facile and effective catalytic oxidation technology for carbonyl compounds production is highly desired. During the last decade, the emergence of new catalytic strategies that intelligently adopt concepts and techniques from the field of electrochemistry provided chemists with new tools to deal with intractable problems of modern organic synthesis [9]. As a promising alternative, organic electro-oxidation shows numerous prospective applications for desired chemical transformations, in which the energy for bond cleavage is supplied by electricity [10], eliminating the need for harsh conditions and the use of pure oxygen as well as external chemical oxidants. Developing an electro-catalytic acceptor-less dehydrogenation as oxidation method, could therefore be an interesting method, avoiding the use of any sacrificial reagents, and leading to only hydrogen gas as by-product. This process not only will avoid using stoichiometric oxidants in the organic transformations, but also could display a potential application for “hydrogen storage” [11]. Although aqueous electrochemical electrolyzers represent green, clean and economic systems for organic synthesis, they are restricted by the low voltage stability window of water (1.23 V). This fact limits reactions to alcohol substrates with lower thermodynamic oxidation potential while making it difficult to control the reaction pathway and avoid the generation of acid products, particularly in the presence of inorganic electrocatalysts [12,13]. Moreover, it can limit the solubility and the stability of organic substrates [14]. Thus, non-aqueous organic electrolytes with greater solubilizing power and stability are equally promising for electro-oxidation of alcohols. However, oxidation and dehydrogenation of alcohol requires the use of proton relays [15–17]. To address these issues, the development of new strategies enabling the efficient and selective electrochemical oxidation of labile and passive alcohols in organic electrolytes is needed. Recently, electrochemical devices such as Li-O2/Li-CO2/Li-S batteries or redox flow batteries have made great use of redox organic molecules or mediators [17–23]. Furthermore, redox organic mediators (RMs) were also shown to hold great promise to facilitate the electrochemical oxidation of inactive alcohols by mediating the electron transfer, which significantly reduces the over potential for alcohol oxidation [24]. Hence, some organic molecules such as triarylamines, (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)-oxyl (TEMPO), and 9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-N-oxyl (ABNO) have been utilized as RMs for electrochemical alcohol oxidation [25,26]. Among the multitude of redox organic molecules, quinones are a class of potentially low cost, sustainable, and high energy density electro-active materials well known for their ability to perform proton-coupled electron transfer processes, thus potentially fitting the requirements for mediating alcohol oxidation [27,28]. The quinone-hydroquinone systems are relevant due to their capability to participate as electron and proton carriers in complex biochemical mechanisms, such as photosynthesis and cellular respiration. This is further reinforced by the versatility of quinones for which their redox properties can be easily tuned, rendering them ideal candidates for investigating their electrochemical behaviour towards targeted alcohol reactions, and thus improving our knowledge on their structure–property relationship [29,30]. However, there is yet no extensive study for using quinones as a hydrogen acceptor mediator to assist the selective electrochemical oxidation of alcohols, hence calling for an in-depth investigation. In this contribution, the potential of 14 derivatives of quinones as a hydrogen shuttle mediator has been assessed, toward oxidation of alcohol. For that, the electrochemical oxidation of furfuryl alcohol to furfural has been taken as model reaction (Fig. 1 ). This reaction normally occurs at a potential up to ca. 2 V vs. SHE [31] which is thus difficult to achieve in an aqueous-based electrolyte. DMSO has been used as solvent because of the solubility of a large number of quinones in this solvent. Coupling electrochemical measurements with 1H NMR, both the conversion and the selectivity of the reaction were estimated, while long-term measurements were performed to assess the stability of the best quinones over prolonged electrolysis. Overall, this comprehensive study enriches our knowledge on the behaviour of different family of Quinones towards alcohol in organic solvents and opens new perspectives for selective electrocatalytic reactions with other challenging substrates."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials The solid chemicals such as anthraquinone (AQ, 97%, Sigma Aldrich), disodium anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS, >98%, TCI), 2-ethylanthraquinone (EQ, ≥97%, Aldrich), anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid (CQ, 98%, Sigma Aldrich), anthraflavic acid (DAQ, 90%, Sigma Aldrich), 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone (DAAQ, 97%, Sigma Aldrich), 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (PAQ, ≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ, 97%, Sigma Aldrich), 2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone (DCNQ, 98%, Sigma Aldrich), p-benzoquinone (BQ, ≥98%, Sigma Aldrich), 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBBQ, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), tetramethyl-1,4-benzoquinone (TMBQ, >98%, TCI), tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCBQ, >98%, TCI), 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ, 98%, Alfa Aesar), and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAClO4, ≥98.0%, Sigma Aldrich) were dried at 80 °C under vacuum in a BÜCHI oven before use. The liquid chemicals like furfuryl alcohol (FA, 98%, Sigma Aldrich), furfural (FF, 99%, Sigma Aldrich), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99%, Alfa Aesar) were first degased by argon bubbling, then dried over activated molecular sieve (4 Å, Sigma Aldrich) and stored in the argon-filled glovebox at all times. Argon-sealed deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO‑d 6, 99.9 atom% D, Acros Organics) for NMR was used as received. Other supplies were platinum (Pt) foil (0.1 mm thick, 99.997%, Alfa Aesar), stainless steel gauze (80 mesh woven from Φ = 0.14 mm wire, type 316, Alfa Aesar), glass carbon plate (1 mm thick, type 1, Alfa Aesar), graphite rod (Φ = 3 mm, 99.995%, Sigma Aldrich) and Nafion® N-117 membrane (0.18 mm thick, Sigma Aldrich). High purity gas of oxygen or argon (99.999%, Linde France) was used in specific experiments where necessary."
3,Electrochemical measurements,"2.2 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements were recorded on a VSP multichannel potentiostat (BioLogic Science Instruments) at room temperature with the prototypical three-electrode system. For the electrochemical performance tests carried out in an undivided cell, a Pt foil (1 cm × 2 cm), a Pt coil and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) nested in a salt bridge were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. 0.2 mmol of quinone was first dissolved into 10 mL of DMSO containing 0.5 M TBAClO4 supporting salt, then the mixture was loaded into a home-made conical cell (ca. 20 mL capacity). After that, 2 mmol of furfuryl alcohol was injected into the above solution, and the test was immediately initiated. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements were first performed to probe the redox potentials and stabilities of different quinones with a sweep rate of 25 mV s−1. Chronopotentiometry (CP) measurements with a constant current of 10 mA were then applied for the long-term experiments, which were carried out under stirring at 800 rpm for 2 to 8 h. The yields and selectivity of the reaction were monitored by liquid 1H NMR analysis (see details below) of the sample taken at designated reaction times. In order to avoid possible autooxidation of the quinone anions under air, an argon flow was flushed above the liquid in the capacious chamber all the time."
4,Sample analysis,"2.3 Sample analysis The water content of the liquid sample was determined by Karl Fischer titration (Coulometric KF titration, Metrohm). The solution conductivity of the liquid sample was measured by a solution conductivity meter (S230-KIT, Mettler-Toledo). The 1H NMR spectra of the reaction solutions in DMSO‑d 6 were measured using a 300 MHz Bruker spectrometer. The conversion of furfuryl alcohol and the selectivity of the furfural product at the designated reaction time were calculated by the ratio change of the peak area at 4.36 ppm (–CH2-) and 9.60 ppm (–CHO). Detailed calculations are illustrated as follows: Conversion = A 4.36 t A 4.36 0 × 100 % Selectivity = 2 × A 9.6 t A 4.36 0 - A 4.36 t × 100 % where A t and A0 represent the peak area ratio of the sample taken at a specific time (t) and before the reaction (0), respectively. The number indicates the chemical shift of the peak for calculation."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Electrochemical screening of quinones,"3.1 Electrochemical screening of quinones Prior to study the role of quinones on the electro-oxidation of furfuryl alcohol (FA), the effect of adding FA on the redox properties of a series of quinone derivatives, e.g., benzoquinones (BQs), naphthoquinones (NQs) and anthraquinones (AQs), was investigated (Fig. 2 ). Cyclic voltammetry studies were thus performed to understand the behaviour of these molecules when adding FA in argon-saturated DMSO/0.5 M TBAClO4 electrolyte and assessed if protons are exchanged from FA to the quinone upon redox in this organic media (Fig. 3 ). As observed in Fig. 3, independently of the chemical structure of the quinones, two well-defined redox waves could be discerned for most of quinones before and after FA addition (Fig. 3 a and b), except for DAQ, CQ and DDQ (Fig. 3 c). In fact, quinones, known to participate in diverse electron transfer and proton-coupled electron transfer processes in chemistry and biology, generally undergo a reversible two-electron reduction/oxidation and their redox potential is dependent on their molecular structures and their chemical environments. Hence, quinones are found to feature three readily accessible oxidation states, namely, the fully oxidized quinone, one-electron reduced anion radicals Q −, and two-electron-reduced dianions Q2− [Eq. 1 & 2]: (1) Q + e− ↔ Q − (2) Q − + e− ↔ Q2− The two waves in CV curves generally correspond successively to the formation of quinone anion radicals Q − at higher potential (wave 1: E1) and dianions Q2− at a more negative potential (wave 2: E2). The potentials of these reductions depend on the polarity of the solvent, the nature of the supporting salts as well as on the electronic and steric effects of the various quinone forms (Q, Q − and Q2−). DAQ, CQ and DDQ are found unstable in this electrolyte, in line with a previous study in which a similar CV shape was found for hydroxylated quinones such as dihydroxy AQ, which was explained by the reaction with traces of O2 or self-protonation [32]. Thus, these three quinones were discarded in the rest of our study. When FA is added to the solution for the other 11 quinones (Fig. 3 a and b), no substantial changes in both the reduction potentials and peak heights were observed for the first reduction waves. Only for the second reduction wave changes could be observed, with the Q −/Q2− redox at low potentials being shifted to more positive potentials, except for TCBQ that shows no shift (Fig. 3 b). These results show that the Q/Q − redox reaction is not modified by FA, meaning that protons do not interact with other species. However, as seen by the shift of the second redox couple, Q2− certainly interacts with FA, as the result of hydrogen bonding between the quinone and the alcohol (Fig. 1). Indeed, for quinones, the effect of hydrogen-bonding can be identified from the characteristics of the cyclic voltammogram itself as continuous shifts in potential with no change in wave height, reversibility, or appearance of new waves indicate hydrogen-bonding of reduction products [33]. It has been shown for quinones that small addition of hydrogen-bond-donor (such as water or protic solvent) usually results in both E1 and E2 shifting towards less negative potentials without any loss in chemical and electrochemical reversibility. A single two-electron reduction process giving rise to one single apparent redox peak is subsequently observed at sufficiently high hydrogen-bond-donor concentrations because the shifts in wave 2 are comparatively larger than wave 1. This is explained as a consequence of the increase in electron density at the oxygen atoms after each reduction reaction leading to stronger hydrogen bonds which can be formed between the hydrogen-bond-donor compounds and acceptor Q2− as compared to Q − and Q molecules [34]. Furthermore, for the selected quinones, the coupling appears as chemically reversible, and the anodic peak is assigned to the regeneration of quinones. As obtained from these measurements, the E1/2 values for the first redox wave (E1/2 1) and the second redox wave (E1/2 2) for all of the quinones before FA addition, and the positive shifts measured for the second redox waves (ΔE1/2 2) following the interaction of Q2− with FA are reported in Table S1, SI. Analysis indicates that for AQDS, EQ, AQ, the E1/2 1 potential is in the range of −0.7 to −0.8 V vs SCE (Fig. 3 a). For PAQ as well as for the single- and double-rings, non-electrophilic benzoquinones and naphthoquinones (e.g. DBBQ, TMBQ and NQ), the values for E1/2 1 are measured between −0.55 and −0.65 V vs. SCE. Finally, the highest redox potentials for the one or two rings quinones are measured for the highly electrophilic molecules like TCBQ and DCNQ, while the lowest redox potential is observed for the three-ring nucleophilic DAAQ. After the addition of FA, the highest peak shift (300–350 mV) for E1/2 2 (ΔE1/2 2) is observed for the single ring non-electrophilic quinones molecules such as DBBQ, TMBQ and PAQ, as well as for the nucleophilic DAAQ quinone (electron rich). Instead, the highly electrophilic molecules such as TCBQ, DCNQ and DDQ (electron poor) show the lowest redox potential shift. This effect can be explained by the delocalization of negative charge in the case of electrophilic groups and weak interaction with hydrogen of alcohols. A very similar trend has been observed by Zhang et al. where they used quinone derivatives such as TMBQ, BQ, TCBQ in organic solvent (acetonitrile), for the determination of water in non-aqueous solvent by taking advantage of the structure- and redox-controllable hydrogen-bonding interaction between quinone species and water [35]. They observe that the addition of the same amount of water into the solution leads to the shift of the 2nd redox-potential in an order of TMBQ > BQ > TCBQ. Such phenomena have been elucidated in terms of the different basicity and reactivity of quinone species in the hydrogen-bonding interactions, of which the basicity of the dianion form of TMBQ remains the strongest among three quinones [35]."
7,Electrocatalytic oxidation of furfuryl alcohol,"3.2 Electrocatalytic oxidation of furfuryl alcohol Having established quinones interacting with FA, our attention then turned to understand the effect of such interactions on the efficiency and the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol oxidation. To understand this effect, we first carried out electrolysis tests without additives and found a decrease of FA concentration with time associated with the generation of furfural, according to NMR analysis. The tests have been performed using Pt plate as anode and Pt coil as a cathode in the presence of TBAClO4 as electrolyte. Hence, the conversion of FA without quinone reaches 50% after 6 h (Fig. 4 a). However, the amount of furfural does not match with the amount of FA consumed. As no signals related to other oxidation products like furoic acid were observed while a color change of the solution to brown was seen during the reaction time ( Figure S2 , SI), we can state that furfural or FA is undergoing polymerization reaction during oxidation as previously reported [36]. This assumption is supported by the observation that after the reaction, a dark polymer film is generated on the electrode surface ( Figure S2 , SI). As a result, the selectivity to furfural decreases from 20% to 10% with an increased conversion of FA from 20% to 60 % (Fig. 4 b). The deposition of the polymeric film on the surface of the electrode could also affect the electrocatalytic properties [40]. The coated polymer usually shifts the electrode potential to more positive values and protects the electrode against the aggressive medium to avoid corrosion. Furfural has been used for the generation of conductive porous films on the surface of the Pt electrode with good adherence [41,42]. Having shown the limitation regarding this reaction when carried out in the absence of quinones, we then investigated its conversion and selectivity with added quinones (Fig. 4). For that, we started with single- and double ring molecules such as trimethylbenzoquinone (TMBQ), 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBBQ), 2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone (DCNQ), 1,4-naphtoquinone (NQ) and tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone (TCBQ). We demonstrated a significant decrease of activity for FA conversion, which can be explained by their interaction with FA which slows down the oxidation at the anode (Fig. 4 a). Hence, when comparing the evolution of the selectivity as a function of the conversion, similar results are obtained for TMBQ, DBBQ, NQ and DCQN than those observed without quinones, indicating a minor role played by these quinones in FA activation and oxidation to furfural (Fig. 4 b). The only difference has been observed for TCBQ, which does not show the generation of furfural. The highest reduction potential of this molecule (Fig. 3 , Table S1, SI) could form a highly stable adduct with FA with no generation of furfural during the electrocatalytic reaction. Nevertheless, three-ring quinones like ethylanthraquinone (EQ), 9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid (AQDS) and PAQ display a totally different behaviour. Indeed, the activity increases and the selectivity is lifted by a factor of 4–5 when compared with the result obtained without additives or with single/double ring quinones. However, despite this improvement, the selectivity is again found to decrease from 100% at low conversion of FA to stabilize at about 40% at high conversions. (Fig. 4). The possible reason for single- and double-ring quinones to not affect the selectivity during oxidation of FA could be their limited stability under the reaction conditions with their condensation with time. Thus, to check the stability of the different quinone species, the intensity of the NMR peaks corresponding to quinones was monitored with time. Figure S3 , SI shows 1H NMR spectra of liquid samples during the oxidation of FA over time in the presence of quinones. It might be observed that the intensity of the peaks related to single- and double -ring quinone molecules like DCNQ, TMBQ, BQ, NQ quickly decrease, indicating their fast transformation during electrocatalytic reactions. However, anthraquinones like EQ, PAQ, AQDS, demonstrate significantly higher stability in comparison with single- and double-ring quinone molecules. The CV curves of a mixture of 0.2 mmol AQDS and 2 mmol FA after 500 cycles present no significant shift of the waves 1 and 2 and only a very slight decrease in their peak height, confirming the stability of AQDS (Fig. 5 a). It is interesting to note that EQ, PAQ and AQDS demonstrate high activity and selectivity during oxidation of FA. With AQDS providing the best catalytic performances both in terms of activity and selectivity, it was thus chosen for a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism and further optimization of the system in the rest of this study. The main varied parameters during the reaction were: temperature of the electrocatalytic tests, rotation speed and the ratio of AQDS to FA. The increase of the temperature of the cell from room temperature to 60 °C slightly increases the conversion and the selectivity to furfural from 40% to 52% at a conversion of about 55% ( Figure S4 , SI). This result means that the rate-limiting step of the reaction has low activation energy. Intensive stirring during the electrocatalytic reaction does not show significant changes in the catalytic performance in comparison with results obtained without stirring. This indicates the absence of diffusion limitations during the reaction. Furthermore, increasing the ratio of AQDS/FA from 0.1 to 0.4 is found to lead to an increase of the selectivity to furfural from 35% to 61% for a conversion of FA of about 60% and significantly higher than selectivity to furfural of 7 % without the presence of AQDS (Fig. 6 ). Thus, these results suggest that the presence of AQDS significantly suppresses side reactions of FA and furfural transformation and hence increases the selectivity to the target product. Further, we have studied the mechanism of AQDS assistance in the transformation of furfuryl alcohol."
8,Mechanism of the oxidation of FA in the presence of quinone,"3.3 Mechanism of the oxidation of FA in the presence of quinone First, CV tests were performed for AQDS with the addition of furfural alcohol at different concentrations from 0 to 5 mmol (Fig. 5 b). While no shift on wave 1 is observed, the addition of FA to the solutions made of DMSO + AQDS results in a positive shift of wave 2, which increases smoothly with the increase of FA concentration and with no further loss of reversibility. We can ascribe the significant potential shift of the second wave to a specific AQDS2–-FA interaction. Continuous shifts in potential with no change in wave height, reversibility, or appearance of new waves indicate hydrogen-bonding of reduction products. It is well documented that derivatives of anthraquinones interact with aliphatic alcohols via hydrogen-bonding through consecutive association steps which depend on the concentration of the alcohols [33,37–39]. In general, in association with the acidity of the proton donors, three different behaviour can be observed in the CV curves. Hence, the evolution of our curves is assigned to the stabilization by consecutive hydrogen-bonding of the dianion (AQDS2–) reduction products, which is observed in the presence of weakly interacting additives, such as FA. The reason for the shift of the redox waves can be explained by the H-bond donation of the FA which can be thought of as adding a partial positive charge to the AQDS, thus stabilizing the AQDS2− relative to the AQDS−. To further confirm the interaction of the AQDS dianion (AQDS2−) with FA, AQDS was first reduced to AQDS2− which has a dark violet colour in the cell (Fig. 7 a). Afterwards, FA was added to a solution containing 0.2 mmol of AQDS2−, and periodic analysis by 1H NMR was performed (Fig. 7 b). Doing so, one could observe that peaks in the range of 8 to 9 ppm disappeared from the spectra recorded for the reduced form of AQDS. This disappearance can be explained by the strong interaction of AQDS2− with hydrogen atom from FA, leading to the delocalization of protons and the disappearance of their respective NMR signals. Furthermore, the addition of FA leads to the gradual growth of the signals ascribed to protons from C–H groups of the alcohol, this apparition being associated with no appearance of NMR signals for AQDS or protons from the –OH group of FA, till an amount of 1.4 mmol FA is added. At greater content of FA, the proton signals related to AQDS appear in the NMR spectra simultaneously with –OH groups of FA. This corresponds to a ratio of FA to AQDS of 7 (1.4 mmol/0.2 mmol) close to the 6 protons in the AQDS molecule. It could be explained by the substitution of C–H protons of AQDS2− interacting with each other by protons in –OH group of FA. The reduction of AQDS can be visually observed in the cell at the cathode during electrocatalytic oxidation of FA with the characteristic dark red color of the reduced form forming with time (Fig. 7). Afterwards, quinone molecules change colour back to their initial yellow colour. NMR and CV results indicate that this interaction should be accompanied by the formation of the stable adduct between AQDS dianion and FA. Overall, this proton transfer from FA to the quinone dianion formed in the solution upon electrolysis can affect and assist the oxidation of alcohol, as our results show. To confirm the role of AQDS dianion in selective oxidation of FA to furfural, an AQDS dianion (AQDS2−) has been added in the electrocatalytic cell. Doing so, the addition of 0.1 mmol of AQDS dianion resulted in an increase of the amount of produced furfural from 0.086 to 0.157 mmol, indicating an almost stoichiometric effect of AQDS dianion on the production of furfural ( Figure S5 , SI). The formation of the AQDS2−−FA adduct result in the formation of furfural associated with the formation of hydrogen bubbles ( Figure S6 , SI), at the cathode and the regeneration of the AQDS (Fig. 1). Based on the conversion of FA the amount of produced hydrogen should be about 26 mL during 8 h of the test. Thus, the electrochemical oxidation of furfural alcohol is a combination of two basic events: a heterogeneous electron transfer process with AQDS occurring at the electrode surface that leads to the formation of a reactive intermediate (dianion), and a chemical process between AQDS-dianion and FA that occurs in solution. AQDS dianion will assist during the oxidation of FA as an intermediate for the transfer of proton providing non-acidic conditions during oxidation of FA, bearing in mind that acidic conditions enhance the polymerization of furfural and this decrease the selectivity and efficiency of the reaction. (Fig. 1). Hence, AQDS can play a double role in the electrocatalytic reaction: - Assistance in oxidation of FA by reduced AQDS due to formation of FA–AQDS2− adduct; - Providing non-acidic conditions in the cell due hydrogen-bonding of reduction products by AQDS and shuttling from the anode to the cathode. It results in a fast and selective oxidation of FA to furfural avoiding the polymerization of furfural with the generation of hydrogen at the cathode."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, we first assessed the effect of adding furfuryl alcohol (FA) on the redox properties of several benzoquinones (BQs), naphthoquinones (NQs) and anthraquinones (AQs). We first revealed that quinones are capable to interact with the hydrogen of furfural alcohols. While the Q/Q − redox reaction is not modified by FA, the shift of the second redox couple Q −/Q2−, shows that Q2− certainly interacts with FA, as the result of hydrogen bonding between the quinone dianions and the alcohol. The effects of the chemical structure of quinones (number of rings, electrophilic and nucleophilic molecules) have also been considered. The analysis of the effect of different quinones in the electrocatalytic oxidation of furfuryl alcohol demonstrates that only the number of aromatic rings have an impact on the selectivity of FA to furfural. In fact, we observed a significant increase of the selectivity to furfural mainly in the presence of three ring quinones (ethylanthraquinone (EQ), sodium salt of 9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid (AQDS) and 9,10-phenanthrenequinone ethyl (PAQ)). No real effect on the catalytic performance have been observed with single- and double ring quinones whatever their nucleophilicity or electrophilicity. Comparing three-ring quinones with other quinones, a strong interaction between the double reduced form of quinones (Q2−) and furfuryl alcohol has been observed with high stability during the reaction. The key role of the reduced form of AQDS in the electrocatalytic oxidation has been identified by an increase of furfural production with its addition to the electrocatalytic cell. The quinone interacts strongly with the proton of the alcohol and assists the oxidation over the anode with the generation of furfural and generating hydrogen at the cathode. This suggests mainly a steric effect, leading to suppress side reactions of FA and furfural transformation and hence increasing the selectivity to the target product. We believe that despite demonstrating the limitations of one- or two ring quinones to mediate the oxidation of furfuryl alcohol in aprotic solvents, the better understanding of the H-bonding using anthraquinones in non-acidic conditions can open a better understanding of the use of derivatives of quinones in electrocatalytical reactions and an interesting track for the production of H2 from alcohol."
