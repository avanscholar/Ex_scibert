0,Introduction,"In recent times, interest in hydrogen production by dark fermentation (DF) of organic waste materials has been growing rapidly because, as a carbon-free energy carrier, hydrogen has notable advantages over other alternatives [1]. The primary advantages include the high gravimetric energy content of hydrogen and the high efficiency with which it can be converted to electricity. Several studies have documented the feasibility of hydrogen production by dark fermentation of feedstocks ranging from simple pure organic substrates [2,3] to complex particulate wastes [4,5]. However, as a waste treatment process, dark fermentation suffers from a disadvantage in that, it does not stabilize the wastes completely as the process terminates in a mix of volatile fatty acids and alcohols in the effluent. This necessitates further downstream processing of these end products to recover either valuable products or additional energy. Possible downstream processes for energy recovery include photofermentation to produce additional hydrogen [6]; microbial fuel cells to produce electricity [7]; microbial electrolysis cells to produce electricity [8]; or anaerobic digestion to produce methane [9]. In designing such two-stage processes, it would be desirable to be able to predict the end products of DF. An ability to predict the concentrations of the products of DF can be beneficial not only in optimizing the design, operation, and scale up of the DF process itself, but also in selecting and designing appropriate downstream processes, and in optimizing the integrated process. Validated models can also be beneficial in making hypothesis, in designing experiments for testing, refining, and validating hypotheses and in in-depth analysis of the processes that may not be possible to realize experimentally."
1,Previous modeling work,"Most previous DF modeling studies had used the Gompertz equation in a curve-fitting mode where, three model parameters are adjusted to fit experimentally measured hydrogen evolution data from pure substrates [10–12] as well as from liquid organic wastes [1,13,14]. In addition to fitting to hydrogen evolution data, Gompertz equation has also been fitted to measured VFA (acetic, butyric and propionic) and alcohol in the effluent, substrate degradation, and hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB) [15]. In spite of the high quality of fitting by this approach, the three model parameters determined through the curve-fitting process are restricted to specific experimental conditions and cannot be extended to other conditions in a predictive mode. In another modeling approach, the classical Monod model has been adapted to describe kinetics of bacterial growth and hydrogen production from liquid substrates [16–18]. Subsequent studies have modified the basic Monod model to include inhibitory effects of pH and substrate [19,20]. Wang and Wan [15] have reviewed the kinetic models commonly used to describe fermentative hydrogen production. The anaerobic digestion model (ADM1), originally developed for predicting methane production by anaerobic digestion, has been modified by some to predict fermentative hydrogen production by switching off the methanogenic step. Lin et al. [21] have adopted the ADM1 model to simulate clostridial glucose fermentation processes. Penumathsa et al. [22] have applied the ADM1 model and a modified form of ADM1 model for non-methanogenic systems with sucrose as substrate, to predict production of VFA, biogas, and hydrogen. Gadhamshetty et al. [12] have proposed an ADM-based model for dark fermentation of sucrose and compared its results with those from the Gompertz equation. More recent studies have proposed a thermodynamic approach with variable stoichiometry to describe product formation by including environmental factors such as pH, temperature, acid concentrations [23–25]. This approach builds upon models originally proposed for anaerobic digestion [26,27] to predict the product spectrum in dark fermentation as well. Penumathsa et al. [22] have applied this approach with variable stoichiometry to ADM1 model to predict biohydrogen production by DF. While the feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated for well-defined single, pure substrates, its application to mixed and/or particulate substrates has not been published. As far as we are aware, none of the previous modeling reports had included particulate feedstock either as primary substrates or as a supplement in fermentative hydrogen production. Our previous report [28] had described the development and validation of a model integrating hydrolysis and DF of particulate dairy manure to predict VFA production. In that study, it was found that hydrogen could not be produced by DF of dairy manure at ambient temperature. However, our subsequent experiments confirmed that increased hydrogen yield from sucrose could be achieved when dairy manure is used as a supplement [29]. In this study, our previous modeling approach [28] is adapted to predict hydrogen production from sucrose supplemented with particulate dairy manure. In this model, we have opted to follow the kinetic approach with fixed stoichiometry, incorporating inhibition due to substrate and pH."
2,Model development,"In the proposed model, sucrose is considered as the primary substrate with solubilized components of dairy manure as co-substrates. Following ADM1, our model also assumes that the major particulate components (cellulose and hemicellulose [30]) are first hydrolyzed to soluble monomers, which are then converted to hydrogen and volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Based on our previous results, biodegradable components of the solubilized manure are considered to be composed of cellulose and hemicellulose [31]."
3,Rate of hydrolysis,"3.1 Rate of hydrolysis In this study, hydrolysis of particulate forms of cellulose and hemicellulose by native organisms is described by a surface-limiting rate expression [31]. Accordingly, the rate of change of particulate concentrations of substrate (P i ), (i = c for cellulose and i = h for hemicellulose) can be described by: (1) d P i d t = − K 1 i ( P i X K 1 s i + P i X ) X"
4,Rate of uptake rate by acidogens,"3.2 Rate of uptake rate by acidogens Uptake rates of sucrose and the soluble forms of cellulose and hemicellulose by acidogens are modeled by expanding the two-substrate-single biomass expressions [31] to three substrates, and including inhibition by pH as suggested in ADM1. The pH inhibition factor (IpH ) is defined in Eq. (2) [32]: (2) I p H = { 1 + 2 ∗ 10 [ 0.5 ( p H L L − p H U L ) ] } { 1 + 10 [ ( p H − p H U L ) ] + 10 [ ( p H L L − p H ) ] } Rates of uptake of dissolved substrate (S i ) (i = s for sucrose, i = c for cellulose, and i = h for hemicellulose) are thus described by Eq. (3)a, b, and c, respectively: (3a) ( d S s d t ) u = − k s ( X ) ( S s ) k s s ( 1 + S h k s h + S c k s c ) + S s M L R ( I p H ) (3b) ( d S c d t ) u = − k c ( X ) ( S c ) k s c ( 1 + S h k s h + S s k s s ) + S c M L R ( I p H ) (3c) ( d S h d t ) u = − k h ( X ) ( S h ) k s h ( 1 + S c k s c + S s k s s ) + S h M L R ( I p H ) Hence, overall rate of change of soluble COD due to uptake can then be described by: (4) ( d S d t ) u = ∑ i = c , h , s ( d S i d t ) u"
5,Rate of change of dissolved substrates,"3.3 Rate of change of dissolved substrates Rate of change of sucrose (i = s) depends only on the uptake by acidogenic organisms and is equivalent to the rate of change of uptake: (5) d S i d t = ( d S i d t ) u The net rate of change of dissolved co-substrate i (i = c for cellulose and i = h for hemicellulose) depends on the rate of production by hydrolysis and the rate of uptake by acidogenic organisms: (6) d S i d t = − M L R d P i d t + ( d S i d t ) u The first term in the right hand side of Eq. (6) represents hydrolytic production of i and the second term, its uptake by acidogens. Thus, the rate of change of dissolved COD in the reactor is obtained by combining the rates of change of the three dissolved substrates (sucrose, cellulose, and hemicellulose): (7) d S d t = ∑ i = c , h , s ( d S i d t )"
6,Rate of change of acidogenic biomass,"3.4 Rate of change of acidogenic biomass Rate of growth of biomass is considered proportional to the rate of uptake of each substrate, with the appropriate yield coefficients. Net rate of change of biomass (X) is obtained by adding the growth rate due to each substrate and including the decay rate: (8) d X d t = ∑ i = c , h , s 1 M L R ( − d S i d t ) u Y i − k d X"
7,Rates of product formation,"3.5 Rates of product formation Soluble substrates in the reactor are converted to VFA’s and hydrogen. Based on experimental results, it was assumed that acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid are the main VFAs produced as byproducts. A fraction of dissolved COD is utilized for hydrogen production since it was assumed that further degradation of VFA’s does not take place under our test conditions. The following equation describes the rate of formation of the product j (j = 2 for butyric acid, j = 3 for propionic acid, j = 4 for acetic acid, or j = 5 for hydrogen) from substrate i (i = s for sucrose; i = c for cellulose; i = h for hemicellulose): (9) ( d S j d t ) p = ∑ i = c , h , s − ( 1 − Y i ) f i 1 − j ( d S i d t ) u It was assumed that total hydrogen gas produced in liquid phase is not consumed by any reactions and is transferred to gas phase."
8,Experimental section,
9,Feedstock preparation and analysis,"4.1 Feedstock preparation and analysis The manure samples were heat-treated to suppress methane formers as described elsewhere [29]. Serum bottles (250 mL) were used as batch reactors with liquid volume of 150 mL. Five sets of reactors (R1 to R5) were set up in triplicates with different amounts of treated manure: 2.5 g in R1; 5.0 g in R2; 10.0 g in R3; 15.0 in R4; and 20.0 g in R5. All five reactors were supplemented with 0.67 g of sucrose to test different sucrose-to-manure ratios: 26.8% in R1; 13.4% in R2; 6.7% in R3; 4.5% in R4; and 3.4% in R5. The manure-to-liquid ratios (MLR) in the reactors were: 6.1% in R1; 12.2% in R2; 24.3% in R3; 36.2% in R4; and 48.0% in R5. The reactors were capped with rubber septa and crimp sealed with aluminum crimp rings, without any pH adjustments, gas sparging or buffers. During the test, the reactors were stirred continuously at 150 rpm using magnetic stirrer and maintained under ambient temperature (25 °C). Gas volume was measured by releasing the pressure intermittently (daily) following the reversible displacement method [3]. Gas samples were analyzed by gas chromatography [29] to determine hydrogen content. Liquid samples were analyzed for pH, COD, reducing sugar, and volatile fatty acids as described by Perera and Nirmalakhandan [29]."
10,Results and discussion,"Methane was not detected in the gas phase analysis of the test reactors, confirming that pretreatment by heat-shocking was adequate to suppress methanogens, and validating the assumption made in the model development. The model was first calibrated following a curve-fitting procedure (using model parameter values reported in the literature and/or those established in our previous studies with manure) to fit the experimental data obtained from Reactor R4. The calibrated model was then validated with experimental data obtained from the other four reactors."
11,Model calibration,"5.1 Model calibration The model equations were implemented in a simulation software package (Extend™, Imagine That Inc.) and solved using Euler’s backward numerical method with a time step of 0.001 day. Initial values of Ph and Pc were set at 0.42 g CODh/g manure and 0.41 g CODc/g manure respectively [33]. Experimentally measured COD, hydrogen, butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid data from Reactor R4 were used to calibrate the model. During this calibration process, values for the following model parameters were established: 4 hydrolysis parameters (K1c, K1sc, K1h, K1sh); 6 biouptake parameters (ksc, ksh, kc, kh, ks, kss); and 12 product yield factors (fs1−2, fh1-2, fc1−2, fs1−3, fh1−3, fc1−3, fs1−4, fh1−4, fc1−4, fs1−5, fh1−5, and fc1−5). The pH inhibition factor was calculated based on the time dependant experimental pH values fed into the model. Based on our experimental results and literature values [34,35], pHLL and pHUL were set to 4.0 and 6.5. Batstone et al. [32] have used pHLL = 4.0 for acetic acid and 5.0 for hydrogen; and pHUL = 5.5 for acetic acid and 6.0 for hydrogen. Gadhamshetty et al. [12] have used pHLL = 5.5 and pHUL = 6.5. Biomass yield coefficient for sucrose was set as 0.1 equal to the value reported by Batstone et al. [12]. Yield coefficients for cellulose and hemicellulose were set at 0.03 and 0.06, respectively; comparable data could not be found in the literature. The death rate was fixed at a typical value of 0.01 day−1. Other model parameters established in this study are compared in Table 1 with typical values found in our previous studies or those reported in the literature. While most of the parameters established in this study are similar to the reported values, four of them (Yh, Yc, fh1−5, and fc1−5) are new ones introduced in this study. Even though maximum rate of hydrolysis of cellulose (K1c) used in this study is higher than that reported by us previously [31] (1.58 vs. 0.09), it is within the range of typical values reported for cellulose (0.13) and carbohydrates (2.5). Values for K1sc, K1h, kc, ksh differ slightly from those reported by us previously [31] and other literature values. These differences could be due to the use of heat-treated cattle manure and operating temperatures. The sensitivity of the model parameters is presented in a later section. Fig. 1 (a) shows the quality of fit between the measured and fitted temporal profiles of COD; the agreement between the two was significant, with r 2 = 0.93. The agreement between the measured cumulative hydrogen production and the fitted values shown in Fig. 1(b) was also significant with r 2 = 0.98. Hydrogen content of the gas phase in this reactor ranged 45–60%. The quality of fit between measured and fitted concentrations of butyric, propionic, and acetic acids is shown in Fig. 2 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. The agreement in the case of butyric and acetic acids was strong with r 2 = 0.98 and 0.96, respectively, while that in the case of propionic acid was somewhat lower with r 2 = 0.87; the correlations were significant in all three cases."
12,Model validation,"5.2 Model validation Data from reactors R1, R2, R3, and R5 were reserved for model validation. Fig. 3 compares the measured and predicted temporal COD profiles in these four reactors. Two processes govern the fate of dissolved COD in these reactors: hydrolytic production of COD (from particulate cellulose and hemicellulose) and acidogenic uptake of COD (from dissolved cellulose, hemicellulose, and sucrose). As shown in Fig. 3, the model predicts the dissolved COD resulting from the above processes well in the case of reactors R1, R2 and R3. However, in the case of R5 (and to some extent in R4, Fig. 1(a)), the model over-predicts COD while following the trend in the measured data. The predictive error could be either due to more acidogenic COD uptake or, due to lower hydrolytic production of COD, than predicted. If the error were due to more COD uptake than predicted, it would have been reflected in a corresponding increase in hydrogen evolution. However, since there was no increase in the measured hydrogen evolution, the error is attributed to lower COD production by hydrolysis than predicted. Because the predictive error increased with increasing MLR, it is presumed that at higher MLRs, the hydrolysis rate constants could be negatively impacted due to lower water content resulting in mass transfer limitations, an aspect not captured by the current model, resulting in higher model prediction than the experimental results. The overall correlation between the measured and predicted COD values was significant with r 2 = 0.85 at p < 0.05. Fig. 4 shows the comparison between the measured and predicted cumulative hydrogen profiles over time in the four reactors. The agreement between the two was found to be good in all the reactors, except in R1 as illustrated in Fig. 5 (a); the correlation between the measured and fitted values is significant with r 2 = 0.84 at p < 0.005, with overall average absolute deviation of 18%. A notable aspect in Figs. 1(b) and 4 is that the experimentally measured cumulative hydrogen profiles flatten after about 5 days in all the reactors, while the predicted profiles do not match this flattening well. This anomaly could be due to either substrate/co-substrate limitation or consumption of hydrogen by homoacetogenesis to produce acetic acid and/or fermentation regulation at low temperatures. Since the model does include substrate limitation effects (in Eq. 3a–c) and the measured data show that sufficient dissolved COD was still available after 5 days, the anomaly is attributed to homoacetogenic hydrogen consumption accompanied by acetate production [36] that is not explicitly included in the model. This hypothesis is further verified experimentally by the decrease in hydrogen composition in biogases after 5 days [data not shown here] and also is supported by the under-prediction of acetic acids in most of the reactors. While this issue is being investigated further through microbial analysis, these results suggest that, detention times <5 days have to be maintained in continuous flow DF systems to maximize hydrogen production. Hydrogen content of the gas phase in these reactors also ranged 45–60%. Fig. 5(b) shows the correlation between the measured total COD and predicted total COD in all five reactors. In this comparison, the total measured COD included the measured dissolved COD and the COD equivalent of hydrogen production; the total predicted COD included the COD equivalent of the remaining sucrose, cellulose and hemicellulose, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, plus that of hydrogen produced. The agreement between the two is statistically significant with overall r 2 = 0.94, p < 0.005, while the overall average absolute deviation in COD balance over the test duration averaged 8.4%, adding credence to the model parameters established in this study. Model simulations were run to discern the contribution of manure towards hydrogen production. These results showed that the contributions from manure ranged from 1.8% in Reactor 1 (2.5 g manure at sucrose:manure ratio of 26.8%) to 14% in Reactor 5 (20 g manure at sucrose:manure ratio of 3.4%). While this yield appears to be low, further studies are warranted to identify the optimal sucrose:manure ratios and the operating conditions to utilize cattle manure as a possible supplement to improve hydrogen production by DF. The agreement between the measured and predicted concentrations of VFAs (butyric, propionic, and acetic acids) is shown in Fig. 6 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. Again, the correlations in the case of butyric and acetic acids can be seen to be acceptable with r 2 = 0.89 and 0.84, respectively, while that in the case of propionic acid was poor with r 2 = 0.57. Nevertheless, the correlations were significant for all the three acids."
13,Sensitivity of model parameters,"5.3 Sensitivity of model parameters The following procedure was used to assess the sensitivity of the parameters used in the model. For each parameter, the base value established during the calibration step was changed within ±10% and five simulation runs were made at each value to generate individual profiles of COD evolution at each value, keeping the other parameters at their base values. A sensitivity coefficient (σp) was then calculated for each parameter from the spread of the predicted profiles using the following equation [37]: (10) σ x Δ p = 1 t f ∫ 0 t f x ( p + Δ p ) − x ( p ) x ( p ) d t where, tf is the process time; x (p+ Δp) is the change in variable x corresponding to the change of parameter value from base value of p to p + Δp; and x (p) is the value of variable x corresponding to parameter value of p. Based on the sensitivity coefficients calculated for each model parameter (Table 2 ), K1c, the hydrolysis parameter, is seen to be the only sensitive parameter of the 10 hydrolysis and biokientic parameters. However, even when this parameter is varied ±10% within of the base value, the resulting variations in COD were less than ±20% (Fig. 7 ). Of the remaining ones, kh, K1sc, ks, K1sh, K1h, kss were found to be slightly sensitive, in decreasing order of sensitivity. This finding is similar to that found by Myint et al. [33] where K1c was identified as the most sensitive parameter and followed by Kh and Ksh in decreasing sensitivity in a study of hydrolysis/acidogenesis of cattle manure. Based on the results of these sensitivity studies, it is suggested that the parameters established in this study could be appropriate for modeling DF of sucrose supplemented with particulate cattle manure under conditions similar to those reported here."
14,Conclusion,"A kinetic model was developed in this study to predict hydrogen evolution and VFA production by dark fermentation of sucrose supplemented with particulate dairy cattle manure. Hydrolysis of the particulate manure was modeled following a surface-limited model and product formation from the soluble components was modeled following ADM1 model. The model was calibrated using experimental COD and hydrogen data from one batch reactor and validated with similar data from 4 other batch reactors run at different sucrose:manure ratios. Model predictions of dissolved COD, total COD, hydrogen evolution, acetic acid, and propionic acid agreed well with the corresponding measured values with r 2 exceeding 0.8; in the case of propionic acid the quality of fit was poor with r 2 of 0.57."
