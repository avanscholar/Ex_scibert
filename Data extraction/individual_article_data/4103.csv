0,Introduction,"Recently, gold catalysis is a topic of interest due to the relatively unexplored catalytic behaviour of this element compared to other noble metals. Gold has been reported to present high activity at low temperatures for a large number of catalytic reactions [1,2] and consequently a lot of research aims to further develop this catalyst. Several authors report a strong dependence of activity on the distribution and size of the gold particles and the nature of the support [2,3]. The surface properties of the support affect the dispersion of gold and, consequently, the catalytic behaviour of the material. Metal oxides [4,5] and organic polymers [6] have been reported as supports for gold catalysts. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinyl pyrrolidine (PVP) are also reported as polymer stabilizers in the synthesis of gold nanoparticles [7–10]. The selective hydrogenation of carbonyl groups in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is an interesting route to the formation of unsaturated alcohols which are important intermediates for several industrial applications [11]. The hydrogenation of 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (citral) is used as a test reaction due to the presence of a conjugated C═O bond in the molecule. Although the hydrogenation of isolated and conjugated C═C bonds is thermodynamically favoured over the hydrogenation of the C═O bond, it is desirable to enhance the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group to form 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-ols (geraniol and nerol), which are the most valuable products for the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries [12]. In this work, we report interesting preliminary results for the selective hydrogenation of citral on gold nanoparticles supported on alumina."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The starting powder, γ-Al2O3, was obtained from bohemite (99.9% Catapal B) after calcination at 500°C for 6h. Gold-containing catalysts were prepared according to an adaptation of the procedure proposed by Shi et al. [7]. The appropriate amount of HAuCl4·3H2O (Alfa, 99.99%) was dissolved in 50cm3 of deionised water and 0.6g of sodium citrate was also added. The solution was slowly added to a suspension of 10cm3 water with 5g of support to give a catalyst with a final metal content of about 2wt.%. The resulting slurry was agitated at 70°C for 6h, then centrifuged and washed with a solution 4M ammonium hydroxide. The solids were dried at 120°C for 12h and calcined at 300°C for 4h. The effect of the presence of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 2g) in the impregnation solution was also studied. The catalysts are designated below as Au/Al-T or Au(PVA)/Al-T, where Au refers to the presence of gold, Al indicates that alumina is the support used, PVA correspond to the presence of polyvinyl alcohol in the catalyst synthesis and T the temperature of treatment."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The gold content of the samples was determined, previous extraction by hot aqua regia digestion, by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a Unicam 629 spectrophotometer. Textural analyses were carried out from the corresponding nitrogen (AgaFano Linde Gas, 99.999%) adsorption–desorption experiments at −196°C using a static automatic volumetric apparatus (Micromeritics ASAP 2020 adsorption analyser). The samples, 0.2g, were previously degassed for 2h at 200°C, at a pressure lower than 0.133Pa. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Siemens D-500 diffractometer, using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was carried out on the powder samples with a Tecnai 20 operating at an accelerating voltage of 200kV. The samples were dispersed in ethanol by sonification and dropped on a copper grid covered with a carbon film."
4,Catalytic performance,"2.3 Catalytic performance The hydrogenation of citral (98%, MERCK) was performed in a stirred batch reactor at 90°C, 0.62MPa and 1000rpm, using 0.2g of catalyst and 50mL of 0.1M citral in hexane (98%, Aldrich). Liquid samples were periodically taken from the reactor and analyzed by gas chromatography (Varian 3400 model)."
5,Results and discussion,"The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 1 . It can be seen from the figure that all the adsorption isotherms were of the type IV in the Brunauer, Deming, Deming and Teller (BDDT) classification [13]. In all materials, a type H4 hysteresis is observed [14]. The textural properties, BET specific surface areas and the total pore volumes [13], of the catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . The impregnation with the aqueous solution of gold caused little or no loss of surface area and pore volume of the support. Similarly, the presence of PVA in the impregnation process did not alter the textural properties of the support. A possible low amount of carbon deposed on the support surface can explain this behaviour. The XRD patterns of the gold-supported catalysts are presented in Fig. 2 . No diffraction peaks due to gold species are detected for the catalysts prepared with the presence of PVA, pointing out their low concentration (see Table 1) and crystalline domain size. However, diffraction lines characteristic of polycrystalline gold phase (JCPDS 04-0784) at 2 theta=38.2, 44.4, 64.6 and 77.5° are observed for the catalysts prepared without PVA. TEM images of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . In all figures, small gold particles can be identified inside the support matrix. It was estimated from the TEM images that the size of the gold particles for all the catalysts are about 10–30nm, with or without the presence of PVA in the synthesis steps. The conversion of citral as a function of reaction time for the catalysts is presented in Fig. 4 . The difference in the catalytic behaviour of the various materials can be attributed to factors such as the presence of PVA and the temperature of calcination during the preparation method. A loss of conversion is found after thermal treatment of the catalysts at 300°C, but this effect is less important for catalysts prepared in the presence of PVA. It seems that the presence of PVA is important in the catalytic behaviour of the gold catalysts. The product yields obtained using the various catalysts in the hydrogenation of citral under our experimental conditions are summarized in Table 1. The reaction products detected by gas chromatography were nerol, geraniol and citronellol. The results clearly indicated that the formation of nerol is favoured by the presence of PVA in the synthesis and the thermal treatment at 300°C. A selectivity of 99% is obtained for this reaction product."
6,Conclusion,The results have shown that gold nanoparticles supported on alumina in the presence of PVA can lead to highly selective gold catalysts for nerol production from the hydrogenation of citral.
