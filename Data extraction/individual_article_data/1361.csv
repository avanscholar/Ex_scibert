0,Introduction,"Sacrificial electron donors (further called sacrificial reagents, SR) are often applied in photocatalysis to enhance the performance of oxidation reactions in aqueous media as pure water oxidation is usually rather inefficient [1]. The most commonly used SR are short-chain alcohols, aldehydes or carboxylic acids. For example in photocatalytic hydrogen production or CO2 reduction SR are frequently described to enable more efficient processes [2–4]. For an efficient process design, the effectiveness of different SR should be known to be able to select the ideal candidate. Also, during the complete photocatalytic oxidation to CO2, these SR go through several intermediates which may also act as SR themselves, which is often overlooked. For the study of an oxidation reaction, always a corresponding reduction reaction must also take place. Ideally, this reduction reaction should not need a co-catalyst. One well-known reaction that fulfills this requirement is the reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The generation of H2O2 via photocatalysis is known for decades, already in 1927 Baur and Neuweiler reported its formation over illuminated ZnO [5]. Recently, a rising interest of photocatalytically produced H2O2 could be observed in literature. Especially in the field of waste water treatment, [6,7] as a possible solar fuel [8,9] and as an in-situ production method for H2O2 sensitive applications like peroxygenase catalyzed reactions [10]. For this purpose TiO2, especially P25, which is a commercially available mixture of anatase and rutile, [11] is often used in heterogeneous photocatalysis due to the suitable band position for the oxidation of water and reduction of molecular oxygen. Different TiO2 based materials and modified TiO2 (e.g., fluoride based surface passivation or metal nanoparticles like Au or Au/Ag as co-catalyst) were developed to further enhance the photocatalytic activity and the quantum efficiency [12–15]. The photocatalytic H2O2 generation via molecular oxygen reduction can be improved by the use of a SR such as ethanol, 2-propanol or benzyl alcohol [16,17]. Unfortunately, the direct oxidation of water is thermodynamically unfavorable vs. the oxidation of alcohols. The kinetics, mechanism and optimization of the photocatalytic H2O2 production regarding the usage of sacrificial agents like alcohols, aldehydes or carboxylic acid are only partially described and not systematically investigated. The mechanism of the H2O2 production in an aerated aqueous solution with a SR can be separated into the reduction of molecular oxygen and two concurring oxidation reactions, the oxidation of water and of the SR (alcohol and derivatives). The electrons liberated from the oxidation reactions are used to generate H2O2. The oxidation mechanisms for methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol have been described in the literature and are shown in Scheme 1 [18–27]. The oxygen reduction and water oxidation proceed in reversible reaction steps formally (other reaction pathways are also possible) as described in Scheme 2 [28]. For photocatalytic generation of H2O2 the kinetics has been described by Kormann et al. assuming a pseudo zero-order formation and a first-order degradation, cf. Eq. (1). [29] The kinetics regarding the oxidation of different alcohols via photocatalysis in correlation with H2O2 production are rarely described. Especially, the characterization of the intermediates and their impact on the H2O2 generation is neglected in most of the literature, even though it is obvious from the reaction mechanisms that the alcohols also supply electrons via the consecutive oxidation reactions of the intermediates, i.e., aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids. (1) H 2 O 2 = k F k D 1 - exp - k D t + [ H 2 O 2 ] 0 exp - k D t Here, we show the systematic and comparative study of oxidative degradation of SR and the reductive H2O2 generation using different electron donors to construct a complete picture of the simultaneous processes occurring during this reaction. Therefore, we choose a simple set-up and focused on the kinetics and mechanistic pathways during H2O2 generation, detecting the intermediates resulting from the degradation of SR. We used SR with different functional groups like alcohol, aldehyde / ketone and carboxylic acid to learn details of the interplay between SR degradation and H2O2 formation."
1,Material and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All alcohols have been purchased from Carl Roth, except for 2-propanol and 1-octanol which were purchased from Merck EMD. TiO2 (P25, Evonik), horse radish peroxidase (HRP Type II), dinitrophenyl hydrazine (DNPH) and 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionic acid have been supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (POHPAA) and TRIS-buffer were purchased from Alfa Aesar, H2O2 from VWR and methyl-1,2-propanediol from abcr. If not mentioned otherwise, all chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification."
3,Photocatalytic reactions,"2.2 Photocatalytic reactions The phosphate buffered (0.1 M, pH 7) TiO2 suspensions were illuminated in a glass reactor (14 mL, cf. Figs. S1 and S2) using a UV-LED (365 nm, M365LP1, Thorlabs) with a mounted collimating optics (SM1P25-A, Thorlabs) under magnetic stirring and permanent bubbling with O2 (2 mL min−1). The temperature was kept at 25 °C via circulating water through a double glass jacket surrounding the reactor. To disperse the TiO2 powder in the buffer an ultrasound glass finger (2 × 5 s, 20% A, UP200 St, Hielscher) was used. For the reactions with 10 mM sacrificial electron donor the suspensions contained 1 g L−1 TiO2 and were illuminated with a volumetric photon flux density of 5802 μE L−1 min−1, determined via ferrioxalate actinometry described in our previous publication. [30] The reactions with 10%(v/v) of the sacrificial electron donor contained 0.1 g L−1 TiO2 and were illuminated with a volumetric photon flux density of 219 μE L−1 min−1. If not mentioned otherwise samples were taken from the reaction solution in defined temporal intervals and the photocatalyst was separated via centrifugation (2 min, 600 min−1, approx. 2000 ×g) before the different analytical methods were performed."
4,Quantification of reactants and intermediates,"2.3 Quantification of reactants and intermediates For the quantification of methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, t-butanol, acetaldehyde, acetone and methyl-1,2-propanediol the aqueous supernatant after centrifugation was directly analyzed via GC-FID (Focus, Thermo Fischer) using a Chirasil-DEX-CB column (25 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm, Agilent) and N2 as carrier gas for the separation. Temperature program: heat from 41 °C to 43 °C with 0.5 K min-1, then 43 °C to 200 °C with 80 K min-1 and hold 9 min at 200 °C. The concentrations were calculated according to calibration with authentic standards. 2-Hydroxy-2-methylpropanal could not be precisely quantified due to the absence of a standard, therefore the concentrations were estimated using the calibration of methyl-1,2-propanediol as the FID signal should be in a similar magnitude. As the FID signal for an alcohol is generally a little higher than the corresponding aldehyde signal, the given concentrations in Fig. 4 for 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanal are slightly underestimated. Formate, acetate and α-hydroxyisobutyrate were quantitatively analyzed against authentic standards using ion chromatography (Dionex, Thermo Fischer) with aqueous NaOH as the solvent, an anion column (Dionex IonPac AS11-HC-4 μm) for the separation and a conductivity detector. Flow rate: 0.2 mL min-1. NaOH-gradient: 0.5 mM to 7 mM in 15 min, to 35 mM in 5 min, hold for 5 min and back to 0.5 mM in 1 min at 30 °C. To analyze the concentration of formaldehyde in the methanol oxidation reaction, 200 μL samples were mixed with 50 μL of a DNPH solution (0.1 g L-1 in 2 M HCl) and the absorbance at 360 nm was recorded after 10 min mixing at 25 °C using a microplate reader (PowerWave HT, BioTek). To analyze the amount of formaldehyde in the presence of acetaldehyde and acetone, a sample of 100 μL was mixed with 25 mL DNPH solution for 10 min. The derivatization products were separated and quantified via HPLC (Nexera X2, Shimadzu) using a reversed phase column (Luna 5 μ C18(2) 100 A (12 × 4 mm), Phenomenex), aqueous acetonitrile as solvent and a UV–vis detector (SPDM20 A PDA detector, Shimadzu), with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1 at 25 °C. Acetonitrile gradient: start with 50% for 2 min, to 70 % in 6 min, hold for 2 min, to 80% in 1 min and hold for 1 min and back to 50% in 1 min and hold for 2 min. For the separation of the DNPH-derivatized substances the same HPLC method was used. The detection was realized with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (LCMS-8040, Shimadzu) equipped with an atmospheric pressure ionization source (APCI, Shimadzu) with negative ionization. APCI parameters: nebulizing gas flow 3 L min−1, drying gas flow 5 L min−1, interface temperature 350 °C, desolvation line temperature 200 °C, heat block temperature 200 °C and interface voltage -4.5 kV. The MS has been run in the multiple reaction monitoring mode with the precursor corresponding to the m/z signal without fragmentation (DNPH-formaldehyde: m/z 209, DNPH-acetone m/z 237, DNPH-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanal: m/z 267 and m/z 249) and a collision energy of 15 V."
5,Analysis of hydrogen peroxide,"2.4 Analysis of hydrogen peroxide The samples taken from the reaction solution were filtered through a syringe filter (0.2 μm, PVDF, Roth) to remove the TiO2 particles before quantification of H2O2. Samples were analyzed using the HRP-catalyzed stochiometric dimerization of POHPAA yielding a fluorescent product [31]. Lyophilized powder of HRP (1 mg, 163 u/mg) and freshly recrystallized POHPAA (4 mg) were both dissolved in TRIS buffer (12.5 mL, 1.0 M, pH 8.8), respectively. 100 μL of the H2O2-containing sample was mixed with 12.5 μL of each solution for 30 min and the fluorescence signal (λex = 315 nm, λem = 406 nm, 25 °C) was measured in a microplate reader (SynergyMx, BioTek)."
6,Results and discussion,"The performance of the oxygen reduction to H2O2 with the use of a SR is highly dependent on the type of SR. Before discussing the results of H2O2 generation we therefore first give an insight into the oxidation kinetics of the alcohols methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 2-methylpropan-2-ol (t-butanol) which were systematically investigated by studying their conversion and the evolution of the various intermediates over time. The kinetics of photocatalytic reactions are often assumed to follow the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) model which is also the basis of the kinetic model employed here. For the simulation, a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type reaction rate term ( R i ) with zero-order reaction rate constant ( k i 0 ), adsorption constant ( K i ) and concentration ( c i ) was employed for each reaction, which featured a common competitive adsorption term, Eq. (2). A complete list of all employed reaction terms can be found in Table S4. (2) R i = k i 0 ∙ K i ∙ c i 1 + ∑ i = 0 n K i ∙ c i At high concentrations, when the catalyst surface is saturated with substrate molecules, zero-order reaction is observed while at lower concentrations, the reaction gradually switches to first-order behavior. This pseudo first-order reaction rate constant ( k i 1 ) can be derived from the product of adsorption constant and zero-order reaction rate constant, Eq. (3). It should be noted that the zero-order and first-order reaction rate constants can only be accurately determined if there are sufficient data points with high and low substrate concentrations, respectively. As the former is not the case for all the intermediates, only the calculated first-order reaction rate constants can be considered accurate. In these cases both the zero-order rate constant and adsorption constant are undetermined. (3) k i 1 = k i 0 ∙ K i Since all experiments were conducted at the same light intensity, catalyst concentration and temperature, the effect of these parameters was not considered in this study. All of these reaction rates were then assigned to differential equations for the concentration change of the various substrates and intermediates, e.g., for formate (Eq. (4); cf. Table S5 for a complete list of the differential equations). (4) d c ( H C O O H ) d t = R 2 - R 3 = k 2 0 ∙ K 2 ∙ c 2 - k 3 0 ∙ K 3 ∙ c 3 1 + ∑ i = 0 n K i ∙ c i These differential equations were subsequently used for a numerical simulation (Euler-Cauchy method, step width Δ t = 1 min) of the reactions, with starting conditions of t = 0 and ∑ i = 0 n c i = 0 , except for the employed substrate which has a starting concentration of 10 mM. To prevent negative concentrations and oscillations, the rates were always limited to not exceed the amount of available substrate. Subsequently, this simulation was fit to the data points using non-linear optimization (Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with least squares) to obtain values for the kinetic parameters which fit to the experimental data points. The optimization was done globally, i.e., only one value for each parameter was utilized in all the different reactions. The photocatalytic methanol oxidation is shown in Fig. 1 . The expected oxidation products of methanol, formaldehyde and formate (cf. Scheme 1), could be readily detected and quantified with good precision. The concentration of methanol in the solution, starting at 10 mM, decreases practically linearly in a pseudo zero-order reaction over 9 h. If there is a switch to first-order eventually, it only occurs at very low concentration (≤1 mM), indicating a high adsorption constant for methanol. After 9 h methanol is quantitatively oxidized and no longer detectable. The degradation rate of methanol in the zero-order regime is 1.28 mM h−1. The intermediates formaldehyde and formate are detectable immediately after the reaction is commenced and the concentration of both increases to a maximum concentration of 0.46 mM formaldehyde and 1.45 mM formate in the first 4 h. Afterwards, their concentration decreases again and after 10 h, complete oxidation is observed, presumably to carbon dioxide. The simulation of the reaction is also shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the kinetic model fits the observed behavior very well and only slightly underestimates the formate concentration after about 6 h. The deviation at the end of the reaction is likely due to the fact that water oxidation was not considered as a viable reaction in the simulation but possibly has a significant effect once the total amount of organics is in the range of only a mM. This competitive oxidation of water would reduce the oxidation rate of formate and would therefore explain the observed deviation. The derived first-order oxidation rates show that the oxidation of methanol is significantly slower than the oxidation of the intermediates formaldehyde and formate by a factor of 11.7 and 4.6, respectively (proposed reactivity: CH3OH < CHOO− < CH2O, cf. Tables 1 and S3), which explains why the intermediates do not accumulate and are only detectable in small concentrations. Consequently, using methanol as the SR has the advantage that there is little effect of the intermediates on the solution properties (e.g. pH) which should remain relatively constant during the reaction. However, the intermediates significantly impact upon the overall reaction. For instance, in the first 2 h of the reaction, only 50% of the reduction equivalents are supplied by methanol oxidation, while formaldehyde and formate contribute 36 and 14%, respectively. The very high reduction rates observed using methanol are therefore only partly attributable to the oxidation behavior of the alcohol itself. Another commonly used SR is ethanol. We measured the amount of ethanol during the photocatalytic reaction and the assumed oxidized intermediate products acetaldehyde, acetate, formaldehyde and formate, cf. Scheme 1. Fig. 2 shows the concentration-time profiles of all species resulting from the oxidation of ethanol in the reaction mixture. Contrary to the case of methanol, the ethanol oxidation behavior is not linear in the studied concentration regime and shows first-order behavior at lower concentrations, which indicates either a low adsorption constant for ethanol or that the intermediates adsorb more strongly, displacing ethanol on the catalyst surface. As the first intermediate, acetaldehyde is directly formed in the initial phase of the reaction and its concentration rises during the first 4 h in the reaction solution up to a concentration of 3.73 mM and slightly decreases after this time. The formation of acetate and the degradation of acetaldehyde show a correlation between each other, as acetate is directly generated through acetaldehyde oxidation, cf. Scheme 1. Acetate accumulates over the whole investigated reaction time of 10 h up to a concentration of 5.78 mM and is only slowly further oxidized. Comparable to methanol oxidation accumulation of formaldehyde and formate is very low (0.11 mM and 0.34 mM respectively after 10 h) as they are oxidized faster than the other substances. The analysis with the kinetic model yields first-order reaction rates of 15.1 and 15.5 min−1 for ethanol and acetaldehyde, respectively, but only 6.1 min−1 for acetate. Since the former are similarly fast, this explains the significant build-up of acetaldehyde during the reaction, contrary to the case of methanol where formaldehyde is oxidized much faster and barely accumulates. The relatively slow reaction rate of acetate presents a bottleneck in the reaction pathway and leads to its high accumulation after prolonged reaction times. This might be explained by the different reaction mechanism of acetate oxidation. Ethanol and acetaldehyde oxidation are initiated by an α-H-atom abstraction to form highly reactive radicals, which, due to their high reduction potential can readily inject an electron into TiO2, oxidizing themselves without the need of additional photons (current doubling) [1,32]. Similarly, methanol, formaldehyde and even formate can react this way [33,34]. However, in the absence of an α-H-atom acetate can only react via the photo-Kolbe reaction, which is initiated by the abstraction of an electron from the carboxyl-group, followed by carbon dioxide elimination and formation of a methyl radical, cf. Scheme 3 [22]. The subsequent formation of formaldehyde requires another oxidation step, which may be realized either thermally with molecular oxygen or via further photocatalytic oxidation. None of the intermediates were detected during the reaction so the subsequent reactions are likely very fast. Since the methyl radical is also highly reducing, it is likely the elimination of carbon dioxide that presents the overall rate-limiting step in this mechanism [34]. Generally, reactions which require a homolytic CC bond cleavage seem to be slow in comparison with the dehydrogenation reactions of alcohols and aldehydes (vide infra). Compared to methanol, ethanol is oxidized slightly faster at low concentrations but about two times faster at high concentrations, cf. Table1 . This might be explained by the preferred oxidation of intermediates in the case of methanol which leads to fewer available active centers on the catalyst for methanol oxidation while from the point of oxidation potentials both alcohols are approximately equal [28]. This is also likely the reason for the similar hydrogen peroxide formation rates observed with methanol and ethanol even though the alcohol oxidation rate constants are quite different. Contrary to the case of methanol, the reduction equivalents generated in the first two hours are predominantly (80%) resulting from ethanol oxidation and intermediates (acetaldehyde contributes 18%) only play a minor role. Consequently, the amount of reduction equivalents generated in this timeframe is slightly higher for methanol (4.99 mM) than for ethanol (4.82 mM) despite the higher alcohol oxidation rate. Another aspect that may make ethanol unattractive as sacrificial reagent is the fact that acetate accumulates during the reaction in significant amounts. Acetate molecules may adsorb and thereby deactivate the catalyst surface. Furthermore, they can also have a noticeable effect on the solution pH which may be an unwanted side-effect. To go on in our systematic studies of different alcohols as SR, we started taking the structural differences into account (primary versus secondary and tertiary alcohols). Consequently, we investigated the kinetic characteristics of 2-propanol (isopropanol) oxidation in our reaction system. The concentrations of 2-propanol and all assumed intermediate products (cf. Scheme 1): acetone, acetaldehyde, acetate, formaldehyde and formate are presented in Fig. 3 . Acetone is formed from the beginning of the reaction and its concentration increases over the first 6 h up to a concentration of 5.57 mM before it starts to degrade slowly. As already described for ethanol oxidation, acetate accumulates here as well over the whole reaction time, however, the reached concentration of 1.07 mM is much lower as it is generated through the also very slowly occurring acetone oxidation. Similar to the case with acetate, the oxidation of acetone to acetaldehyde and formaldehyde also requires the breaking of a CC-bond. There is no proven reaction mechanism for this reaction available, however, since the first intermediates we observe are acetaldehyde and formaldehyde, [36,37] we suspect those are the products of acetone oxidation, which may proceed via the following mechanism: In the absence of an α-H-atom, acetone is first oxidized by H-atom abstraction on the side-chain [38–40] or hydroxylation of the enol-form with a hydroxyl radical. In the former case, proton and hydroxyl ion addition on the terminal C lead to the same product as the latter reaction, a 1-hydroxyacetone radical. This radical subsequently undergoes homolytic CC cleavage to form acetaldehyde and a methanol radical. The latter is easily oxidized to formaldehyde by another photo-generated hole or by electron injection into TiO2, cf. Scheme 4 . These more complex reactions that require breaking a CC bond seem to be generally slower as already discussed for the photo-Kolbe reaction of acetate. The other observed intermediate oxidation products acetate and formate are the results of the acetaldehyde and formaldehyde oxidation via the pathways already discussed. Apart from acetate they are only present in low concentrations. The kinetic model fits exceptionally well in this case and can simulate all the intermediates with good precision. The resulting rate constants for 2-propanol oxidation are 182% relative to methanol at high concentration but only 25% at low concentration, presumably due to bad adsorption on the photocatalyst surface. However, acetone oxidation is very slow and only shows a first-order rate constant of 1.15 h−1 (9% of the methanol oxidation rate). This is the reason why the overall amount of generated reduction equivalents in the first two hours (5.25 mM) is only marginally higher than for methanol even though the alcohol oxidation rate is almost double. Here, the vast majority of electrons are released from 2-propanol oxidation (76%) with minor contribution from acetone (7%), formaldehyde (7%) and formate (6%). Due to the high amount of reduction equivalents generated, 2-propanol seems like a good sacrificial reagent. The primary intermediate observed, acetone, shows similar properties to isopropanol and has therefore likely no negative effect on the solution properties. However, acetate may also accumulate in prolonged experiments with the aforementioned negative effects, which researchers using this reagent should keep in mind. The fourth often applied alcohol as SR is t-butanol (2-methyl-2-propanol), a tertiary alcohol. The mechanism of the oxidation is quite different to the other ones, since it is not possible to oxidize a tertiary alcohol by α-H-atom abstraction and formation of the direct ketone. There is no clear reaction mechanism described in the literature, often it is just assumed that the alcohol is oxidized to its relatively stable radical and no further products are considered. This is a very deceptive assumption as we clearly detect a number of further oxidation products, namely acetone, acetate, formaldehyde and formate. Additionally, the formation of new signals has been observed in the GC, HPLC and IC chromatograms. The additional signal in the HPLC could be identified via LCMS as the DNPH derivative of 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanal, cf. Figs. S10 and S13. The signal in the IC could be identified and quantified as 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionic acid using an authentic standard (cf. Fig S15). Similarly, one of the two GC signals could be identified as 2-methylpropane-1,2-diol. Judging from the degradation pathway and the retention times the second signal in the GC is likely 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanal (cf. Fig. S8), although this could not be verified as an authentic standard was not available. In the initial phase of the reaction both formaldehyde and acetone formation can be observed, cf. Fig. 4. With a brief delay of about 40 min 2-methylpropane-1,2-diol, 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanal and after 1 h also 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionic acid were detected. While formaldehyde is oxidized very fast and accumulates only over the first 4 h to a concentration of 0.49 mM, the acetone concentration rises nearly over the whole investigated reaction time reaching a concentration of 1.89 mM. The concentrations of 2-methylpropane-1,2-diol and 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanal both rise over 6 h up to 0.38 mM and 0.84 mM respectively. Similar to acetate in the previous reactions, 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionic acid, which is also oxidized via the photo-Kolbe mechanism, accumulates over the whole investigated reaction time up to a concentration of 1.56 mM. Subsequently, acetate and formate can also be observed in small amounts as the corresponding products. Interestingly, acetate only accumulates over the first 5 h. The maximum concentrations reached are 0.52 mM and 0.16 mM respectively. There were also hints of acetaldehyde on the chromatograms but they were below the limit of quantification (approx. ≤ 0.1 mM). The photocatalytic mechanism of the complete t-butanol oxidation has so far only been partially discussed in the literature [41–43]. Taking into account the intermediates detected in this study and in comparison to the mechanisms described for radiolytic oxidation of t-butanol [44] and photocatalytic decomposition of MTBE [45] a photocatalytic multi-pathway reaction mechanism can be postulated, cf. Scheme 5 . The initial step for pathways (I)-(III), a β-H-atom abstraction, can either be achieved by reaction of t-butanol(1) with a hydroxyl radical [44] (b) or by a reaction with VB holes of the photocatalyst and deprotonation (a). The generated 2-hydroxyl-2-methylpropyl radical (2) can either react with an additional hydroxyl radical (I) to form 2-methylpropane-1,2-diol (3) or add O2 to generate the respective peroxyl radical (4) which is described to proceed at a nearly diffusion-controlled reaction rate [46]. Two equivalents of 4 can subsequently disproportionate under O2 elimination in two different pathways: either under formation of 3 and 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanal (5) (II) or under formation of 3, acetone and formaldehyde (III) [44]. In all three pathways 3 is oxidized in a mechanism akin to other primary alcohols (cf. Scheme 1) via the respective aldehyde 5 to the corresponding carboxylic acid 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionic acid (6). The oxidation of 6 proceeds in a photo-Kolbe reaction under CO2 cleavage to form a 2-propanol radical. The subsequent electron injection into TiO2 or reaction with VB holes results in the formation of acetone. The fourth pathway (IV) is described to proceed under non-basic pH [45]. It is initiated by a reaction of a reactive oxygen species, generated via photocatalytic processes (e.g., O2 − , HOO , H2O2, OH), which can react with 1 to form t-butyl hydroperoxide (7). The respective carbocation (8) is in a proton dependent equilibrium with 7 and can react via deprotonation to isobutene (9). In a closer look, the reaction from 1 to 9 is simply a dehydrogenation catalyzed by H2O2. Dehydrogenation of 1 has already been described to proceed photocatalytically at elevated temperatures, albeit the detected intermediates were slightly different [41]. However, the presence of 7 and 9 has been measured under aqueous photocatalytic conditions by Barreto et al. [45] Isobutene can subsequently undergo oxidative cleavage to form acetone and formaldehyde [47]. In the initial phase of the investigated reaction acetone and formaldehyde are produced equimolar indicating a concerted generation (or two very fast consecutive reactions), cf. Fig. 4. Acetone and formaldehyde cannot be produced solely through the oxidation of 6 which is oxidized in a photo-Kolbe reaction and as already described above these reactions (particularly acetate oxidation) are slower compared to the reactions with an initial H-atom abstraction. Furthermore, as 3, 5 and 6 are detected with a delay, it is rather unlikely that the reaction proceeds exclusively through (III) which would have explained all intermediates detected in this work with only one pathway. This underlines the theory of parallel reaction pathways. The oxidation of acetone and formaldehyde to CO2 was already discussed in detail above. This complex oxidation pathway was subsequently implemented into the kinetic simulation. While pathway III was implemented in the model, it is mathematically redundant as it can be reproduced by linear combination of the pathways I and IV. The optimizer consequently set it to zero but that does not mean that pathway III does not take place. The resulting optimal fit reproduces the measured data with very good precision with only minor deviation of the acetone concentration at the beginning of the experiment. According to the simulation, pathways I, II and IV contribute 6, 39 and 55%, respectively, to the t-butanol oxidation rate, the latter two also include an unknown contribution from III. The combined oxidation rate shows kinetic constants of 3.87 mM min−1 and 0.42 min−1 for the zero and first-order regime, respectively. Interestingly, out of all studied alcohols this is the highest zero-order but the lowest first-order rate constant, which implies that t-butanol does not adsorb well on TiO2 and requires significant concentrations of the alcohol to not be limited by substrate availability. The oxidation products of t-butanol on the side-chain, 3, 5 and 6 show first-order rate constants of 2.35, 1.64 and 0.62 min−1 which is comparable to the behavior of ethanol and its oxidation products but an order of magnitude lower, presumably due to the aforementioned bad adsorption behavior. In the first 2 h of reaction, a total of 8.69 mM reduction equivalents are generated, assuming that all reaction steps proceed photocatalytically. This is 74% more than with methanol as SR. Interestingly, only 30% of these originate from the oxidation of the substrate alcohol (all three pathways) with major contributions from formaldehyde (25%) and formate (24%). Therefore, t-butanol could be an interesting SR due to its large number of reducing equivalents generated, even though they mostly come from subsequent oxidation steps. However, it should be kept in mind that during the reactions, significant build-up of the carboxylic acids and acetone are expected which might have an effect on the overall reaction system. All of the rate constants obtained through the kinetic simulation are summarized in Tables 1 and S3. In the case of the intermediates, the first-order rate constants could not be accurately determined due to the low concentrations present. However, particularly for the intermediates, only the first-order rate constants are relevant anyway, as they are typically only present in small concentrations. It appears that with the exception of the extremely fast reacting formaldehyde, the oxidation rates of the alcohol and the corresponding aldehyde are of similar magnitude. The carboxylic acids (except formate) and the ketone are always the slowest reactions in series and consequently acetate, acetone and 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionic acid present the kinetic bottlenecks in their respective degradation pathways. This is mirrored perfectly by the observation that these intermediates accumulate in the respective reactions. The likely origin for this behavior lies in the different reaction mechanisms. While the oxidation of the alcohols and aldehydes (and formate) are dehydrogenations which are initiated by α-H-atom abstraction, carboxylic acid and ketone oxidation requires CC bond cleavage which appears to proceed generally slower over illuminated TiO2. The comparison of the alcohol oxidation rate shows the interesting behavior of t-butanol > 2-propanol = ethanol > methanol in the zero-order regime while in the first-order regime the order is completely reversed with methanol = ethanol > 2-propanol > t-butanol. This shows that the larger alcohols are oxidized faster but adsorb less well on the photocatalyst and therefore require higher concentrations to achieve maximum reaction rate. This adsorption behavior can be explained perfectly by the increasing bulk of the hydrophobic carbohydrate chain from methanol and ethanol to 2-propanol and t-butanol, which inadvertently negatively affects their adsorption on the strongly hydrophilic TiO2 surface. Since many of the oxidation reactions discussed herein might also occur non-photocatalytically, the alcohol oxidation rates alone do not necessarily give an indication of photocatalytic activity and correspondingly, the rates of photocatalytic reduction. Unfortunately, these reactions are not beneficial in the case of using SR as the purpose is not to oxidize them but rather to generate electrons to power the corresponding reduction reaction. For instance, autoxidation with molecular oxygen only serves to unproductively consume the alcohol (and oxygen). By also directly studying the reduction reaction rate (in this case, H2O2 formation), the real rate of photocatalytic conversion can be estimated. The fraction of observed reduction rate (presumably the photocatalytic reaction rate) to total oxidation rate (averaged from the simulation over the first 2 h) is termed faradaic efficiency (FE) and presented in Table 2 . The H2O2 generation rates and faradaic efficiencies for methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol are very similar. In those cases, the FE ranged from 24 to 29%, indicating that the majority of oxidation events does not lead to hydrogen peroxide formation. The reason for the low apparent FEs likely lies in the fact that not all oxidation reactions proceed photocatalytically. In the case of t-butanol, the highest number of reduction equivalents are generated but the lowest peroxide yield is observed which indicates that non-photocatalytic oxidation is quite pronounced, which in not surprising given that one non-photocatalytic pathway (IV) was already formulated as part of the reaction mechanism. As some of the intermediates showed very high oxidation rate constants, they were also evaluated as SR themselves. The formation rates of H2O2 for other SR including many of the intermediates studied are shown in Fig. 5 and Table S2. Here, the SR was added in 10 vol-%, which represents a commonly employed concentration regime and should lead to pure zero-order kinetics and prevent depletion of the SR in the considered time-frame. The best performing reagents are formate and formaldehyde, which are significantly better than methanol by 46 and 20%, respectively. However, this does not reflect the enormously higher first-order rate constants (462 and 1170 %, cf. Table 1), which indicates that formate and particularly formaldehyde adsorb exceptionally well on TiO2 since a high adsorption constant would lead to lower zero-order rate constants, cf. Eq. (3). Also, as mentioned above it should be kept in mind that the formation rate observed with methanol is significantly affected by the intermediates (formaldehyde and formate), which could explain the smaller difference. Ethanol and acetaldehyde show the same formation rates with acetate being significantly lower which is in perfect agreement with the respective calculated kinetic constants. Similarly, the peroxide formation rates obtained with 2-propanol and acetone also fit well with their respective oxidation rate constants, albeit acetone is slightly higher and acetate a bit lower than expected. The latter could be explained by the fact that acetone oxidation produces two easily oxidizable intermediates (acetaldehyde and formaldehyde) while acetate oxidation only yields formaldehyde. This order does not correlate directly with the oxidation potentials, which was already shown for formate, oxalate and acetate with ZnO as photocatalyst by Hoffmann et al. [18,48] The excellent H2O2 formation rate reached with formate might be assisted by the slightly increasing pH during a reaction up to pH 8, which is advantageous for H2O2 generation [30]. However, as the pH is 7 at the beginning of the reaction this should not influence the initial H2O2 generation rate that much. Furthermore, the oxidation rate of formate is slower than the one of formaldehyde, indicating a more efficient electron transfer into TiO2 in the case of formate. As already mentioned above, acetate oxidation is slower due to its good adsorption and the different oxidation mechanism which is directly reflected with the low H2O2 generation rate. Furthermore, generation of peracetic acid can reduce the amount of free H2O2 [18]. Compared to direct water oxidation, all investigated SR still yield a higher H2O2 formation rate. The oxidation of water is unfavored compared to the presented SR due to its one electron redox potential (2.7 V vs. NHE in comparison to e.g. 1.2 V vs NHE for methanol) [28,34], but still it is possible to oxidize water as the valence band of TiO2 is more positive. So, in aqueous media water oxidation competes with the oxidation of the SR and will increasingly take place at low SR concentrations. These results suggest that formate or formaldehyde would be best suited as sacrificial reagents. However, the former will significantly affect the solution pH which will also shift during the reaction or require very high buffer strengths. Formaldehyde on the other hand is known for a number of likely unwanted side-reactions with many organic molecules and may even self-polymerize. These properties might make these substances unattractive despite their effectiveness. Methanol presents an appealing alternative with also high peroxide formation rates, in part attributable to the mentioned intermediates. However, in this case, the intermediates do not accumulate due to their faster oxidation kinetics and are unlikely to negatively influence the reaction. Ethanol and 2-propanol are also interesting options with good formation rates, but researchers should be aware of the fact that acetate and in the latter case also acetone will accumulate over the course of the reaction with possible effects on the pH and ionic strength of the solution. The results of these study show that t-butanol is not recommended as SR. Even though its oxidation rate constant is very high this does not yield a high peroxide formation rate, likely due to the fact that some of the oxidation reactions occur auto-catalytically, effectively wasting a lot of electrons."
7,Conclusion,"Four different alcohols have been thoroughly evaluated in their effectiveness as sacrificial reagents for the production of H2O2. All of the detected intermediates have also been analyzed and their contribution to the overall reaction was considered. This analysis confirms the known pathways of complete oxidation for methanol and ethanol and proposes and validates new ones for 2-propanol and t-butanol. Furthermore, a detailed kinetic model for the various oxidation pathways was developed and applied to the observed behavior with an excellent fit in order to determine the rate constants of the individual reaction steps. The kinetic simulation revealed that reactions which require oxidative CC bond cleavage such as the oxidation of ketones or carboxylic acids other than formate present a kinetic bottleneck as they are always the slowest in their respective series. Consequently, these intermediates accumulate during the reaction which may lead to undesired side-effects such as altered solution properties (solubility, pH, ionic strength) or catalyst deactivation by blocking of adsorption sites. In that context, methanol is recommended as sacrificial reagent as it leads to high H2O2 formation rates and in this case, no intermediates accumulate in significant amounts. Formaldehyde or formate would be even better if there are no negative effects of high concentrations of these reagents towards the target oxidation reaction. 2-propanol and ethanol can also be used but acetate and in the latter case acetone will accumulate during the reaction which should be kept in mind. t-butanol is not recommended as SR due to the high number of accumulating intermediates and the low faradaic efficiency. Also, the simulation made obvious that there is a significant contribution (20–70 %) of subsequent oxidation reactions of the intermediates towards the total number of generated reduction equivalents (electrons). Consequently, these follow-up reactions always have to be considered when evaluating sacrificial reagents. Similar studies should also be done with other commonly employed sacrificial reagents such as EDTA or diethanolamine as the (intermediate) products of their reaction are typically not considered, either. Furthermore, the studied substances might also occur during photocatalytic mineralization of organic pollutants (e.g., MBTE), but they are often neglected due to the claim of CO2 and water as only products. In our opinion it is important to have a closer look into possibly accumulating intermediates in this context as they might be harmful arising in high concentrations."
