0,Introduction,"Oxygen containing molecules, particularly originating from natural resources, are increasingly important for the production of hydrogen as alternative(s) to those processes based in the use of fossil fuels and particularly methane [1]. Such alternatives would have a significant impact in controlling pollution problems as well as global warming and are mostly related to the production of hydrogen from water and molecules derived from natural sources, particularly bio-alcohols. As the use of water in electrolysis or other processes involving renewable sources (as solar-driven water splitting) render limited outputs with current technology, the reaction between water and oxygenated hydrocarbons in steam reforming or the use of water in the water gas shift (WGS) reaction appear as appealing processes. These two main processes have been subjected to intensive research nowadays in terms of the solid and reactant mixture response and behavior at relevant processing conditions. Recent reviews provide a complete view in terms of kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of the two chemical processes mentioned as well as for the solid description and behavior under reaction, including active site determination and characterization [2–6]. Basic physicochemical properties of the supported metal catalysts are typically explored in order to explain their catalytic properties for these processes. Thus, control of metal–support interactions is essential in order to achieve a good dispersion of the active metal in the form of small nanoparticles which can present more defective and active surfaces. The nature of the support is also important in terms of accomplishing most adequate acid-base characteristics for the process in each case. Additives or promoters are also employed in this sense like alkaline metals or acidic oxides which aim to weaken bonds of relevant intermediates, thus increasing the reaction rate, or helping to drive the reaction toward desired reaction path among different possibilities, as well as to destabilize possible poisoning agents formed during the course of the reactions like carbonate species. Reactive supports are also used in many cases in order to modify the redox properties of the active metal as well as to directly intervene in relevant steps of the reaction as bifunctional promoter. On the whole, it is typically the interface between metal and support, rather than the individual components themselves, which features the active region and presents new specific characteristics itself which are different from those of the metal and the support, as examined in a recent report [7]. Another important concern is related to the durability of the systems and mechanisms involved in their deactivation. Adequate control of the handling of carbonaceous residues to limit their stabilization and modification of the properties of the active sites and/or their accumulation and final encapsulation of the active phase as well as the occluding of support porosity are typically explored in this sense; in turn, issues related to sintering of the active metal phase also constitute a main target explored in the literature in this respect [1–6,8]. Within this context, we focus on the study of catalytic systems having base metals as main active phase. We particularly review the last five year results, not fully covered by the above mentioned review reports. Base metals typically used in the water gas shift or reforming reactions are copper, nickel and cobalt, being iron (typically combined with chromium, copper and others) also employed in specific cases. They generally show different functionalities as a function of the type of process in which they operate and will accordingly be described separately. The aim is in any case achieving the highest possible activity and hydrogen selectivity while keeping the longest possible durability. In all cases, such tasks require the control of the active phase morphology and its redox properties typically by means of tuning the interaction with the support or the modification of the metal by alloying while optimum acid-base properties derive from selection of the adequate support and/or addition of specific promoters, as mentioned above. All these aspects are critically examined in this mini-review for the three main metals mentioned, attempting to provide a complete summary of most interesting results. In order to serve as a basis for the report, Table 1 summarizes activity results collected from the literature during last five years for the catalysts/processes mentioned. It must be noted that direct comparison between the results of Table 1 is not possible since experimental conditions employed appreciably differ between them. The use of TOF is most desirable in this sense although this is not possible in most cases for a number of reasons. First, in most cases, knowledge of the nature of the active site is not clear while controversy exists on whether oxidized or metallic states are most active ones depending on the catalyst/process involved; in turn, relevant reaction steps can take place over support sites within bifunctional schemes. In second place, determination of the amount of exposed metallic sites (required to be measured in order to calculate such parameter) is not easy when dealing with reactive supports; note in this sense that direct detection and quantification of the number of exposed centers is normally prevented through available techniques by the small size and absence of periodicity in the tiny metal nanoparticles while the use of probe molecules during chemisorption measurements, as typically employed to determine the metal dispersion, usually provide erroneous estimations due to their spillover and reaction over the support. Moreover, the assumption of an adsorbate to surface atom ratio independent of size is well known to be incorrect. Table 1 can nevertheless be useful in order to identify main trends found in the field as well as to highlight the discrepancies encountered and which limit in some case the establishment of general principles for the behavior of the catalysts."
1,Copper catalysts,"1.1 Copper catalysts Catalysts based on copper are most interesting for various processes involved during production of hydrogen generated from oxygenated molecules resulting from processing of fossil or biomass feedstocks. In particular, they show interesting characteristics for reactions like the reforming of methanol or related C1 molecules and the water-gas shift (WGS) [41–43]. Their catalytic properties for such reactions depend strongly on the morphological and chemical properties of the copper which are affected by interaction with the support employed in each case while the characteristics of the support itself can be also relevant since bifunctional processes can be involved in these reactions and/or its acid/base properties can be relevant for the process [2,42]; some example in this sense appears also reported in Table 1. Concerning copper-based catalysts for the WGS reaction, as well known, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 is the commercial catalyst for the low temperature WGS process industrially applied for hydrogen production from hydrocarbon reforming. Its main properties for the process were examined in detail in the review of Ratnasamy and Wagner [2]. Modifications of such formulation upon addition of promoters (like rare-earths, for instance; some example is shown in Table 1) typically focusses to enhance the stability of the catalyst, particularly under oxidizing environment, as will be exposed below. Copper has also typically been examined as substituent of chromium, taking into account the carcinogenic nature of Cr6+, in high temperature Fe–Cr oxide WGS catalyst [2,44]. Copper is shown to act as promoter of the catalytic activity of such high temperature shift catalyst since it decreases the activation energy and increases the selectivity upon decreasing the methanation activity of the Fe–Cr oxide catalyst [44]. It is generally proposed that the strong interaction between metallic copper and Fe3O4 can be responsible of such beneficial effects [45]. In this sense, recent theoretical results show that Cu doping of the Fe3O4(111) surface is effective for enhancing the adsorption strength of CO molecules while they allow inhibiting the presence of excess water molecules which could cover the active sites; in turn, the Cu dopant can improve the activity of the Fe ions adjacent to the dopant for adsorbing both CO and water [46]. In connection with these investigations involving catalysts combining copper and iron, catalysts related to the spinel copper ferrite have displayed interesting properties for the process. The presence of weak basic sites along with the high copper dispersion achievable on such catalyst are proposed as most relevant properties to attain high WGS activity and stability during the process [47,48]. Highly active and stable WGS catalysts are also achieved when using systems related to the Cu–Mn spinel, as shown in a recent study [13]. In any case, further than enhancing the catalytic performance of commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, an important concern of current WGS research is related to the poor tolerance to oxygen presence displayed by such commercial catalyst [2]. Particularly when dealing with on-board hydrogen generation, it is essential that the WGS catalyst does not become degraded by interaction with atmospheric air. This has prompted the search of new oxygen-tolerant WGS catalysts and zirconia- and ceria- based copper catalysts appear most promising in this sense. Indeed, zirconia-supported copper catalysts have shown promising characteristics for the WGS process [20,49,50]. The small particle size of Cu crystals which can be achieved upon its dispersion on zirconia is pointed out as most relevant to the catalytic activity over this type of catalysts [20]. In turn, the possibility that a large amount of oxygen vacancies can be present on the ZrO2 support, allowing the establishment of strong synergetic interaction between Cu and ZrO2 is considered as key to explain the WGS properties of this type of catalysts [20]. These characteristics are similar to those invoked to explain the interesting WGS properties of ceria-supported copper catalysts for which the active sites for the reaction have been identified on the basis of in situ DRIFTS, time-resolved X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy as involving both metallic copper and oxygen vacancies in ceria [51,52]. The important role of oxygen vacancies in ceria, related to the activation of water as rate-determining step for the process, led in turn to the development of the inverse configuration of this type of catalyst in which copper acts as support of ceria and which apparently presents advantages in terms of catalytic performance with respect to the classical direct configuration [53], as illustrated in Fig. 1 . The catalytic properties of this type of catalyst have been explored in detail by using model systems consisting of CeO x entities deposited on metallic Cu(111) surfaces which were prepared by deposition of metallic cerium in an oxygen atmosphere, most useful for the analysis of interfacial and catalytic properties of this type of catalysts [54,55]. Comparison of this model system with an analogous CeO x /Au(111) one evidences the existence of important interfacial redox processes in CeO x /Cu(111) as a consequence of the relatively strong interaction between both components in such case [54]. Such important interfacial interactions between the two components in the inverse model system CeO x /Cu(111) are proposed as most relevant to explain its significant WGS activity in comparison with a direct Cu/CeO2(111) model catalyst [54]. In this latter, the amount of oxygen vacancies present under reaction conditions appears relatively low in comparison with the inverse catalyst; in this sense, the presence of most of the cerium as Ce3+ species interacting with metallic copper under WGS conditions in the inverse system apparently provide most optimum catalytic characteristics to this catalyst [54]. Rationalization of the WGS reaction mechanism operating in these catalysts combining copper and ceria has been also done upon exploring such inverse model catalyst. A redox mechanism was proposed to operate, at least at relatively high temperature, on the basis of analysis by in situ-XRD and -XAFS of ceria-supported copper catalysts [51]. However, associative mechanisms involving interfacial carboxylate or carbonate species have also been reported and could operate at low temperature [54–57]. Support to the associative mechanism involving carboxylate interfacial intermediate was provided by DF theoretical analysis of inverse model systems based on that employed experimentally [54]. An interfacial HOCO species was proposed to be formed in such case as a transient species and following interaction between OH and CO species formed respectively on the CeO x and Cu components of the system [54]. Such study indicates that although the dissociation of water, leading to formation of the OH intermediate, can occur on the oxide nanoparticle, the other reaction steps are proposed to take place at the metal/oxide interface [54]. Experimental evidence for this mechanism was provided later during analysis of the WGS reaction by near-ambient XPS [54]. Thus, an interfacial adsorbed bent carboxylate (CO2 δ−) species was identified over the model CeO x /Cu(111), with ceria presenting a highly reduced state under WGS conditions [55]. The formation of such carboxylate species following decomposition of the carboxy (HOCO) intermediate at the metal–oxide interface was indeed supported by DF calculations too [55]. The observed results thus indicate that the simultaneous participation of atoms present on the metal and the oxide is the key toward the formation of carboxy and carboxylate intermediates which favor a new effective WGS reaction mechanism [55]. On the other hand, isotopic exchange experiments by means of SSITKA-DRIFTS of an inverse CeO2/CuO WGS catalyst have shown that among the various species detected in the infrared spectra (i.e., formates, copper carbonyls and carbonates), a particular type of carbonate species, proposed to be formed at the interfacial region, was identified as a reaction intermediate, within an associative type mechanism [56]. It must be noted in any case that carbonates can play a double role in this type of catalysts since, besides constituting intermediates for the reaction, they can also act as poisons for the WGS reaction; this latter issue has been investigated in a recent study combining DRIFTS and near-ambient XPS analysis which shows that H2O in the reactant mixture promotes catalyst reduction, thus leading to formation of active sites for the process, by facilitating the decomposition of interfacial carbonate species [58]. Determination of the specific role of carbonate species (as intermediates or as poisons, probably depending on the type of carbonate involved in each case) requires in any case further research. In turn, the oxygen tolerance of this type of WGS catalysts combining copper and ceria has been demonstrated during experiments of O2-assisted WGS in which the interaction between copper and ceria apparently promotes the WGS activity of the system in the presence of oxygen [59]. Modification of the interfacial properties of the contacts between copper and ceria can be most useful to enhance the WGS activity of this type of catalysts. An example in this sense is provided by beneficial effects observed upon introduction of W to Cu–CeO2 [18]. Fig. 2 provides a comparison of the activity in presence or absence of W in the catalysts formulation. A CuWO4 phase is apparently formed under reaction conditions in this case, as detected by in-situ XAS and Raman, and controls the interfacial behavior of the catalyst [18]. In the presence of such minor intermediate phase, an important WGS activity increase is detected [18]. Two points are considered as most relevant to explain the promoting role of W and are related to the enhancement of the redox properties of ceria, as shown in Fig. 2 with the response of the ceria lattice to different atmospheres, and the formation of a direct contact between the metallic Cu phase and the intermediate CuWO4 nanoentities, as detected by the low R region of the EXAFS Fourier transform of the W containing sample with respect to the NiCe binary parent system (see Fig. 2) [18]. Therefore, it appears that active sites for the WGS reaction over this type of catalysts are constituted by interfacial entities involving metallic copper species and support vacancies [7]. The interfacial location of the active sites poses important difficulties in terms of determining TOF values for the activity of the sites. This is due to the fact that their quantification is not feasible by any of the typical methods employed for such purpose. First, direct observation of the dispersed copper through high resolution electron microscopy (or associated techniques) is limited by the absence of contrast between copper and ceria and/or by the intrinsic spatial resolution attainable so far with such techniques [60]. It must be also considered that TEM in-situ instruments are in any case relatively far from realistic reaction conditions in terms of possible gas mixtures employed (difficulties concerning the use of complex organic compounds) as well as the total pressure required in many catalytic processes. In second place, typical methods based on chemisorption of probe molecules (N2O adsorption, for instance) are not selective to the interfacial metallic copper sites (or even to the surface exposed sites [61]) while reaction with reduced sites of the support can also take place leading in any case to overestimation of the number of active sites [62]. Other approaches to such estimation, also not selective to the interfacial sites, are rooted on estimating the amount of exposed copper sites on the basis of the average bulk metallic copper size determined by XRD (which disregards possible contributions from very small highly dispersed particles) or XAFS [63]. This latter method has here been employed to estimate the TOF in a Cu–Ce x W y O2-d catalyst, as collected by Table 1. These aspects should be taken into account when examining data in Table 1 in which TOF values are reported. Probably, the approach to a real TOF value becomes more valid in this sense when the active sites can be attributed to all the exposed metallic sites (as it may occur with Cu/Al2O3 catalysts [19]) than when the activity is due to interfacial copper sites promoted through interaction with the support (as it may occur, as discussed above, when dealing with ceria- or zirconia- based catalysts [16,20]). On the other hand, as mentioned above, acid-base properties of the support have been also pointed out as relevant to the WGS activity. In a study comparing copper catalysts supported on different supports and based on the analysis of CO2-TPD profiles, it has been shown that the amount of strong basic sites on Cu–ZnO x and Cu–AlO x catalysts with high WGS activity was much less than those on Cu–FeO x and Cu–CeO x catalysts with low activity. This factor was considered as most relevant to explain the enhanced activity per surface copper atom observed over the former catalysts [11]. In the case of ceria-supported catalysts, the presence of carbonate species has been proposed as further contributor to the basicity of the catalyst, proposed to be harmful to the WGS activity [9]. In any case, generic consideration of acid/base properties does not generally focus to how such property specifically affects to the active sites at local level. In this sense, as mentioned above, certain carbonate species has been proposed to be involved in the poisoning of active interfacial sites in Cu/CeO2 catalysts [58], since their presence would affect to the interfacial redox activity and as a consequence to the general stability of the catalyst. Other issues related to the stability of the catalysts concern basically the thermal sintering of the dispersed copper or the stabilization of the active state of copper. For instance, it is well known that copper in Cu/ZnO catalysts is prone to sintering which motivated the addition of refractory oxides like Al2O3 or Cr2O3 to the catalyst [2]. It is interesting in this sense that, despite a substantial decrease in specific and metallic copper surface area is produced during reaction, a Cu/ZnO catalyst weakly doped with La appears rather stable during a 25h test under reforming mixture [14]; this has been attributed to the fact that the main role of La would be related to keeping an active partially oxidized state of copper in the catalyst [14]. Concerning methanol steam reforming (MSR), the most common process employed for production of hydrogen from methanol, most important objectives are related to minimizing the activity for the side reaction of methanol decomposition, yielding undesirable carbon monoxide (CH3OH→CO+2H2), while avoiding catalyst deactivation related to either copper sintering, coke deposition or changes in the chemical state of copper [41,42]. In this respect, main target in copper MSR catalysts is related to achievement of stable dispersed copper entities exposing the largest possible metal surface area. This has driven efforts toward development of new preparation methods or modification of traditional ones as well as the addition of promoters; a detailed review on how preparation methods affect the characteristics and performance of MSR copper-based catalysts can be found elsewhere [41]. In turn, an important controversy still exists with respect to the nature of the active site or details of the reaction mechanism, as collected in detail in a recent review [42]. One of the most used catalysts for MSR is that combining copper and ZnO which is similar to that employed for methanol synthesis from syngas, taking into account the strong similarities in intermediate reactions involved during both processes [42]. The beneficial role of the interaction between ZnO and copper for MSR has been generally related to the ZnO promotion of the copper reducibility, the enhancement of copper dispersion or the possibility that most active defective copper nanoparticles are formed [41,42,64,65–67]. Strong metal–support interactions involving migration of zinc oxide subspecies onto the metallic copper nanoparticles upon reduction has been recently demonstrated in a detailed study by TEM of a commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 methanol synthesis catalyst, as illustrated in Fig. 3 . Another beneficial role of ZnO has been attributed to the fact that ZnO can act as hydrogen reservoir thus facilitating hydrogen spillover [68]. In turn, the possible formation of Cu–Zn alloy under more or less severe reducing conditions has been also pointed out as beneficial to the MSR activity [69,70]. The latter has been recently rationalized on the basis of a study of a model copper-zinc by near-ambient XPS under in-situ conditions [71]. The model system basically display regions showing Cu–Zn alloy on which the selective methanol dehydrogenation to formaldehyde appears most favored while redox-active regions in which the alloy appears in contact with oxidized zinc zones assist in water activation and the transfer of hydroxide or oxygen to the latter region, thus providing optimum conditions for high CO2 activity and selectivity [71]. Alumina is typically employed as support of Cu–ZnO in which it acts as stabilizer or structural promoter [41,42]. In this sense, the presence of alumina along with Cu–ZnO has been observed to be beneficial in terms of achievement of higher selectivities for H2 and CO2 during partial oxidation of methanol as well as in terms of catalyst durability [72]. This latter can be enhanced by using copper spinels able to provide significant thermal stability along with high copper dispersion [42]. In this sense, a recent work shows that a Cu–Al spinel oxide containing a small amount of CuO can provide MSR activity higher than commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 without performing reduction pretreatment [73]. It is proposed that the CuO phase starts the methanol transformation at a low temperature while CuAl2O4 gradually releases active Cu under reaction conditions [73]. The omission of the reduction pretreatment allows limiting copper sintering in the initial catalyst while it can apparently limit copper-sintering also during the reaction, thus enhancing the stability of the catalyst [73]. It has been also observed that the catalytic performance of the spinel catalyst can be further improved by adding an excess of Al2O3, which can be of help for increasing the surface area and dispersion of the CuAl2O4 crystals [73]. A low temperature (150–200°C) fully CO2 selective hydrogen production by MSR has been reported over a CuZnGaO x spinel catalyst [22]. The working catalyst is shown to exhibit 3–4nm copper particles on average along with small copper clusters stabilized on a defective ZnGa2O4 spinel oxide surface. Promoting effects of CeO2 on MSR copper-based catalysts have been generally attributed to achievement of high copper dispersion as well as possible stabilization of Cu+ state as a consequence of strong copper–ceria interaction [41,74]. In addition, ceria can also provide beneficial effects in terms of catalyst deactivation when this is produced as a consequence of coke deposition while it can enhance the oxygen transport properties of the catalyst [75]. Catalysts of copper supported on zirconia have shown important catalytic benefits for the MSR process [41,76]. As described in the work by Purnama et al. [76]. they can display higher activity in terms of methanol conversion than commercial CuO/ZnO/Al2O3; they also exhibit better long term stability, attributed to the lower copper sintering as a consequence of stronger interaction with the zirconia support; a third most interesting property of copper/zirconia catalysts is their lower CO selectivity. Similar catalytic effects were observed when comparing Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 and Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3, the latter displaying ca. 16% higher methanol conversion and 7.3 times lower CO molar fraction as a consequence of the presence of zirconia [77]. The enhanced properties of zirconia-supported copper catalysts have been attributed to various effects. First, as structural promoter, zirconia apparently promotes the copper dispersion helping to hinder copper aggregation and keeping crystal size under reaction conditions [78,79]. The enhanced CO2 selectivity of these catalysts has been proposed to result as a consequence of the activity of the interface formed between copper nanoparticles and ZrO x H y (i.e., hydroxylated zirconia) entities in a study of MSR properties of model catalysts [80]. This study shows also that small copper nanoparticles over zirconia can catalyze the full dehydrogenation process leading to CO formation [80]."
2,Nickel catalysts,"1.2 Nickel catalysts Ni-based catalysts prepared over alumina, zirconia, ceria and more complex supports, as those containing Zn–Al or Mg–Al in oxidic environments, are frequently used in the production of hydrogen from oxygenated molecules. There is also a significant number of catalysts produced in-situ, under reaction conditions, as evolution of multicationic materials based in hydrotalcites, perovskites, lamellar mixed hydroxides and mixed oxides. While Ni-based catalysis are used in the WGS reaction, most of the literature concerns the reforming of oxygenated molecules coming from biomass, mostly alcohols but in specific cases, aldehydes (acetone, aceltaldehyde) and acids. Reforming is carried out in presence of water, steam reforming, but in many cases the co-presence of oxygen in connection with autothermal or partial oxidation processes as well as supercritical water, thermochemical looping or CO2-sorption-assisted technologies have been investigated [2,4,81–83]. Note that, on the other hand, the WGS is a part of any reforming reaction carried out with water. In all these processes, control of metallic Ni morphological (particularly primary particle size and shape) and system (metal and support) redox properties, as well as mitigation of deleterious carbon production or deposition are key factors to obtain active and stable catalysts. Table 1 reports reaction rates and turnover frequencies in the most studied reaction, the reforming of alcohols (particularly ethanol) for Ni materials having always high loading and relatively low dispersion (below ca. 30–20%). The large range of values displayed by catalytic observables makes difficult any straightforward conclusion. This is a consequence of the different reaction conditions as well as the limited reliability of TOF values which, in most cases and as discussed above, are calculated using chemisorption measurements of the nickel surface area or fraction. In spite of this a few points become evident. First, the turnover frequency is strongly dependent on the nature of the reactant: for instance, when comparing ethanol and glycerol reforming with the same catalysts, a difference of roughly two orders of magnitudes is observed at pseudo-stationary conditions [38]. The chemical nature of the reactant and its intrinsic difficulty in being transformed and/or producing deactivation effects at the catalyst surface are obviously critical. This is related, as discussed below, to the way the carbonyl as well as CH x entities forming the molecule are activated and handled by the catalyst. More importantly, differences of nearly two orders of magnitude in turnover frequencies are observed for ethanol reforming using high loading Ni- based systems supported in different oxides, indicating the crucial role of the metal–oxide interface at working conditions [33–35]. This, as well as many other proofs presented in the literature, indicates that active sites are presented at the metal–support interface, at least in systems with intrinsic high activity. Then, as discussed above, the turnover frequency values reported in Table 1 are of relative validity as they do not provide information of the real active site. Although the analysis of catalytic properties based in real turnover frequencies is limited by the above mentioned reasons, the above discussion indicates that the managing of the catalyst morphology and redox properties in turn commanding activity, selectivity as well as stability, are critically dependent on the support and therefore of its ability for developing specific metal–support interactions. For such reason, the investigation of each support of interest in alcohol reforming has its own singularity and here we will try to summarize the most relevant issues reported for the most important supporting materials. Alumina provides thermal stability to run processes at high temperatures, typically around or above 600°C [84,85], but to stabilize the catalysts morphology and specifically metal size against sintering, several contributions essayed the addition of promoters, being La the preferred stabilizing agent [86]. Other additives, like Mg, Ca, Na or K, provide several functionalities but all share the beneficial effect of limiting coke formation [87,88]. Such limitation can have multiple causes but, in general, the most significant are two. The first is related to the activation of the CO molecule produced by incomplete oxidation processes or the reverse WGS reaction in (oxidative and normal steam) reforming processes or present as a reactant in WGS. Particularly, the excessive activation of the CO bond, driving to strong weakening of the molecular bond or dissociation is intimately linked with factors like the control of Ni undercoordinated atoms, the electronic state of the metal, or the effect of the metal–support interface; in turn, the presence of additives as those mentioned above can also limit the CO bond activation [87–89]. An excessive activation of the CO molecule is also connected with the methanation and Boudouard reactions, the former producing a not desired product (methane) in most of the applications and rendering coke through methane decomposition, and the latter with direct and important implications in coke formation. The formation of carbon species within these routes starts with formation of nickel carbide phases, either as bulk or more probably as a carbide-type shell at the surface of nickel particles [90,91]. In such cases, encapsulation and irreversible deactivation of the catalysts typically occur when the rate of formation of carbon species at the surface of the carbide is higher than the diffusion or elimination rates, leading to production of irregular, mostly amorphous, carbon phases covering the nickel particles. When the formation rate is lower, graphitic filaments occur with variable degree of order and lower problems of deactivation. It is known that Ni particle size is critical to control this behavior, with size well below 10nm limiting deactivation effects [92–94]. The second is the effect of Ca but also K and Na ad-species in neutralizing support acidity. This can have significant impact in the control of alcohol dehydration processes rendering olefins, well known precursors of coke. This is critical for alumina. These additives (Ca, K, Mg, Na, etc.) may positively affect activity properties of the system through several physico-chemical phenomena, not only controlling the support acidity but also controlling the size of the nickel avoiding or limiting aggregation, with beneficial catalytic effects in terms of increasing activity, selectivity to hydrogen and longevity of the catalysts [4,81–83]. Ca based oxides constitute, on the other hand, the central additive for building up CO2-capture elements in a CO2-sorption enhanced Ni-based reforming catalyst [95,96]. The production of carbonate phases with concomitant consumption of CO2 is at the heart of the process, being in such case the control of the particle size and the subsequent or parallel effects in phase reversibility (from oxide to carbonate and vice versa) the most challenging aspects for obtaining highly active and stable catalysts. It must be however noted that the most successful additive in alumina supported catalyst is ceria [4,81,97,98]. This is intimately related to the multiple roles played by the ceria promoter in reaction conditions. Ceria basicity and redox properties as well as the formation of a highly active nickel–ceria interface are likely the most important issues. Both issues are discussed below. We can finalize the alumina supported systems mentioning those catalysts related closely and derived from in-situ formation of hydrotalcites, nickel aluminates or Mg–Al, Zn–Al complex hydroxides and oxides. They usually present a mixture of phases having, apart from nickel contributions, Al and frequently Mg oxides as constituent(s) under reaction conditions. In these cases, the main issue is the control of the metal morphology by a confinement effect and/or as a result of the strong and, in some cases, specific interaction with the support or a component of the support. Ni as well as bimetallic NiCo catalysts produced in this way were mostly applied in reforming reactions [8,95,99,100–102]. K-promoted hydrotalcites were also used in CO2-sorption enhanced reforming processes [103]. Although the control of the base metal (Ni) morphology is adequately achieved in the majority of the cases, the formation of solid solutions with Mg or the stabilization of nickel aluminates are strong hindering factors limiting the efficiency of such systems since they do not allow or limit the formation of the metallic base metal phase. Most commonly, the adverse effects are overcome with the introduction of small amounts of noble metals [104,105] or by the addition of rare earths such as Ce or Pr [106]. As mentioned, ceria is likely the support most investigated in connection with the metal–support interface effects in the catalytic reactions mentioned. The electronic perturbation of nickel in contact with ceria has been demonstrated by core and valence photoemission and DFT tools [107–109]. The interaction has been also investigated in the oxide phase, that is, for Ni2+ within a ceria environment [110]. In both cases a strong electronic perturbation of Ni with defect of charge with respect to the bare (metallic or oxidic) reference was established. Such picture and, in particular, the Ni electronic state however evolves with the reduction degree of ceria [111]. The metal-support, nickel–ceria interface effect is in any case at the heart of the catalytic behavior of this system in many reactions, and it has been extensively studied in the WGS [17,110,112], alcohol (particularly methanol, ethanol, and bio-glycerol) reforming [34,38,113,114] and oxidative/autothermal alcohol reforming [115,116] processes. As it occurs in the case of alumina, the relatively simple WGS reaction has been intensively analyzed to show that high activity is a consequence of the adequate activation of the CO and H2O molecules. In the case of CO, such activation should be not high enough as to weaken significantly the C-O bond since this promotes the methanation and Boudouart reactions but must provide sufficient interaction with the metal to render a “stable” enough surface complex to allow nucleophilic attack [117]. In contrast, H2O interaction with the catalytic solid must be strongly promoted, being reduced states of the ceria component particularly efficient in doing the job. As shown in Fig. 4 , the ceria lattice responds to the reactive atmosphere, being reduced significantly. In parallel, Ni is also responding to the WGS atmosphere, producing metallic states. The time response of the catalytic solid components to the atmosphere indicates that the reaction rate seems to critically correlate with the ceria redox behavior, indicating the importance of the ceria and particularly fluorite defects (or, in other words, oxygen handling properties) in the kinetics of the reaction [110]. It is unclear however if this can be associated to a redox mechanism with direct incidence of lattice oxygen or is somehow related to other mechanism(s) where the key role may be played by OH species at metal–support interfaces. Likely this is a question of temperature, dominating the redox path at high temperature, above ca. 250–300°C. In WGS and concerning systems with positive effect in activity, the role of Ni has been modulated mostly in relation with the CO activation using CuNi [10,33,118] and ReNi [119] bimetallic catalysts while the use of Na or K promoters has been considered in terms of suppressing methanation by poisoning or blocking of Ni undercoordinated atoms [120] or by a direct influence in the support behavior and concerning its redox and/or OH properties [120,121]. The modulation of ceria behavior has been also frequently done by introducing doping cations in the fluorite structure. Zr as well as other cations such as W, Nb, Mn, and Pr were tested [122–126]. These cations enhance the oxygen mobility in ceria and, in addition, may alter surface properties in relation to basicity and OH characteristics. In the presence of W, the detection of specific intermediates of the reaction, like monodentate carbonates, not detected in the absence of such cation, would in fact indicate a different surface chemistry with potential importance in the reaction [125]. Similarly, combination of ceria and other supports, such as Mn or Ti oxides, has been also shown to produce active and stable catalysts by both modifying the interaction of ceria with nickel and concomitant modification of ceria morphology and redox characteristics [127,128]. The chemical state of ceria is, as discussed, critical in such cases but exact details (its nature in terms of being isolated or associated, the involvement of surface or near surface species as well as their inherent redox behavior) of the defect states associated with the presence of Ce3+ are under debate. Reforming of bio-molecules and, particularly, bio-alcohols using water (w/o oxygen) has been also subjected to an intensive scrutiny using nickel-ceria materials [114–116,129]. As mentioned previously, the basic nature of ceria limits noxious effects related to coke formation derived from formation of olefins in acid centers. Again, the mutual effect of Ni and Ce indicates that each component of the catalyst is a structural promoter of the other, stabilizing primary particle size against sintering. This is illustrated in ethanol or glycerol steam reforming in the microscopy study of post-reaction CeNi binary systems with different Ni:Ce atomic ratios [38,130]. As shown in Fig. 5 the increasing Ni:Ce atomic ratio produces a lower contact between components; being a drastic change observed between samples having 20 and 30at.% of Ni (cationic basis). In this case, the average nickel primary particle size goes from 3.8 (Ni20Ce80) to 7.8 (Ni30Ce70) nm. The loss of contact correlates with the activity of the samples in the steam reforming of glycerol, producing high activity and stable or, alternatively, low activity and unstable catalysts in dependence of the high or low degree of interaction between components [38]. The mutual interaction between Ni and Ce has also a specific role in managing the surface ad-species as it shows to have a critical effect in both the correct transformation of alcoxy species in carboxylate species and in the intermediate evolution of such carboxylate species (and related species, for example acetyl and acetaldehyde for acetate), or their evolution to render hydrogen as main product. As summarized in Fig. 6 , water is believed to be mostly activated by ceria with no significant influence of the metal. Ethoxy species seems to require the activation of the two components, nickel and ceria, to efficiency evolve in carboxylate species rendering hydrogen and not producing spectators or even blocking surface groups. Note that most of the carboxylate groups observed by infrared and related techniques are known not to be related with the active species and only specific studies using transient methods, isotopically labeled molecules or the existence of singular activation modes (such as monodentate carboxylate type species) have been pointed out as corresponding to the presence of potential reactive species. Also, subjected to discussion is the role of each phase in activating simultaneously the CH x and carboxylate entities. While this is not obvious from most experimental data in real catalysts [129,130], theoretical analyses as well as studies in model systems suggest that a concerted effect will be needed to provide the adequate intermediates for producing hydrogen together with minimal coke precursor entities such as methane olefins [7]. Ceria, as can be the case of other reducible oxides of lower interest in this context, seems unique among the most frequent (here enumerated) supports. The reducible oxide seems unique in playing an active role in the activation of CC and CO bonds in such a way that hydrogen and carbon dioxide are the main products with absence of by-products (related or not with carbon deposition). Apart from the above discussed effects of ceria in nickel morphology, chemical state and redox behavior, the effect of nickel in ceria chemical (redox, number and nature of defects) state, as well as the effects of the two components in the activation of the alcohols and key intermediates of the reaction, many details of the Ni–Ce interaction are still under debate. For example, the critical role of hydrogen present in the ceria lattice in activating nickel at reaction conditions has been proposed to be kinetically significant and maybe related to the activation of the alkoxy species by hydrogen abstraction steps [115]. Such issue was demonstrated for the autothermal ethanol reforming reaction but is probably of significance in all conditions. The specific effect of ceria in nickel morphology and, particularly, in the stabilization of undercoordinated nickel atoms with concomitant modulation of their electronic properties are also hot topics (shared with the above discussed results concerning the WGS reaction) to be fully elucidated in the future. In spite of all these open questions concerning the binary system, the nickel–ceria interface behavior has been attempted to be modified or modulated in many forms. Among them, a few were successful in increasing activity in reforming of bio-alcohols. The direct modification of the metal behavior using bimetallic catalysis, particularly upon addition of small quantities of noble metals such as Pt, Pd, is probably one of the most utilized [36,131–133]. Of course the noble metal role is not limited to the modification of nickel by structural (ensemble) or electronic effects [134] but also provides positive effects in handling carbon residues and, obviously, if separated from Ni, its own catalytic role. The modification of ceria is mostly considered by using either doping or by deposition onto a carrier. In both cases, morphological (primary particle size and shape) and redox properties of ceria can be modified [135–137]. Such properties are not easily decoupled and together have a strong influence in the behavior of the oxide at reaction conditions for reforming reactions. Doping with Zr, La or W has been shown to provide important activity benefits in terms of activity and longevity of the catalysts [130,138,139]. In these works, obvious modifications of the ceria redox behavior are usually considered to be determinant on the activity modification. Control of size, this modulating in turn redox specific properties of ceria, was also achieved through deposition of ceria onto other carriers, usually oxides. Such pathway has been investigated deeply with alumina as described earlier in this section but also using other oxides such as titania [140]. In this last case, the significant enhancement in Ce3+ presence by effect of interaction with titania has been clearly demonstrated [141,142]. Although a medium to large ceria reduction degree was previously discussed here to be beneficial for WGS or reforming reactions, mostly in relation to the water molecule activation, in order to avoid undesired evolution under reaction, the ceria-titania supported catalysts require the use of rutile as the titania phase (evolving from anatase under reaction) and also to limit the exposure of titania at the surface for reforming processes, as it will promote alcohol dehydratation and formation of coke precursors. Zirconia is another oxide frequently utilized to produce nickel-based catalysts, mostly in relation to their application in reforming reactions [86,143,144]. Strong interaction with the support, enhancing the stability of nickel oxide states was also demonstrated in this case concomitantly to a stabilization of the zirconia tetragonal phase which presumably increases the oxygen mobility under reaction conditions [144]. Both facts permit the control of nickel morphology as well as limitation of carbon deposition. The microscopic or molecular bases of all such effects are however poorly understood in the case of zirconia. Similarly to previous cases using alumina or ceria, the incorporation of La as a superficial modifier of the oxide has been also demonstrated to be beneficial for the activity [86]."
3,Cobalt catalysts,"1.3 Cobalt catalysts Co catalysts and, in parallel, NiCo catalysts have received attention in reforming reactions. While a significant number of supports have been used, most successful ones are cerium, lanthanum and zinc oxides [4,5,145]. Apart from that, some works concern the use of alumina and the lantana-alumina combination, particularly in the case of bimetallic NiCo promoted systems [145–148]. It is also interesting to mention that thermochemical looping in connection with the oxidative ethanol reforming process was attempted using Co2Fe2O4 as initial source of Cobalt [149]. Similarly to the previously reviewed active metals, the control of the metal morphology properties and redox state and the limitation of carbon deposition, in turn intimately related to the redox behavior of the support, are critical issues analyzed in most of these works. In the case of Co, the effect of the metal primary particle size has been analyzed in the reforming of biomolecules for carbon-supported materials in reaction differential conditions, allowing to extracting relevant information (Table 1). The use of carbon as support is particularly interesting to eliminate support effects due to the weak interaction with cobalt and thus the relatively easy situation for studying metal size effects. In the case of ethanol, the maximum of activity was reported at ca. 3nm, while in the case of acetone the optimum size was obtained for ca. 13nm nanoparticles [38,40]. Such apparent mismatch deserves further analysis to understand the significant impact that the differences in terms of: (i) the potential effect of pre-reducing treatments which can gasify the support rendering cobalt carbide surface/bulk species depending on the temperature (reduction is usually carried out between 350 and 550°C); and (ii) the structural (surface fraction and undercoordinated cation) and electronic (highly reactive sites) differences expected for nanoparticles below 5nm and above 10nm would have in the interaction, activation and transformation of oxygenated molecules. The elucidation of these questions requires the use of an in-situ combination of structural/electronic techniques such as EXAFS, XANES, XPS and others which are not available in the above mentioned studies. In the case of ceria, the cobalt–ceria interaction is claimed to provide, as previously shown with the other two metals here described, a strong stabilization of the oxidized cobalt states (mixtures of +2 and +3 states) with indications of some electronic perturbation [150,151]. The initial oxidation state evolves under reaction conditions and only redox states associated to CoO or Co(0) seem active under reaction conditions [152]. Reductive or oxidative pre-treatments render different cobalt species as a function of the employed temperature but the catalytic activity only appears when the above mentioned species are formed. The co-existence of both Co(I) and Co(0) species is thus detected under ethanol reforming conditions on the basis of XANES (Fig. 7 ) and would be crucial for the activity [152]. Ethanol and glycerol steam reforming reactions were analysed using the ceria-supported cobalt catalysts [152–154]. A few other molecules or mixtures like bio-butanol were also essayed [155]. In the cobalt-ceria system, the most investigated role of ceria was the relationship of surface morphology with defect nature and properties and the incidence of such variables in the deposition of carbon and thus the stability of the materials. Although additional effects on cobalt dispersion cannot be ruled out, it appears that nanocubes with exposed (100) faces or nanorods have increasing quantities of anion defects than typical in ceria nanoparticle formulations and provide significant protection against carbon deposition [137,154]. Carbon deposition together with cobalt dispersion decrease are usually mentioned as main causes for deactivation in all cobalt-supported systems but particularly in ceria ones [4,5,145]. The initiators of carbon deposition are less defined than in the nickel case due, possibly, to the more complex chemical situation but: (i) the influence of carbon impurities containing oxygen left in the preparation process; (ii) the presence of structurally ill-defined cobalt carbide-type entities; as well as (iii) some of the reaction intermediates, particularly molecules containing CC and CO bonds as well as methane, seem the most important precursors of coke [145,156,157,158]. The management of the situation is connected, as well known, with the “final” production of the different carbon species formed under reaction as they can have limited (as some but not all filaments) or strong (amorphous encapsulating carbon) influence on the catalytic properties [159–161]. In cobalt systems, the selectivity of the reforming reaction is also a critical issue, not only in connection with the formation of carbon monoxide and methane as main by-products, as in the nickel case, but also with significant formation of intermediates such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, ethane, methyl ketones, and many others [152–154]. Infrared studies attempted to shed light into this question. In all cases, the ethoxy and ester species are observed and, in general lines, a situation not essentially differing from the one previously presented in Fig. 6 for nickel, appears operative as well for cobalt-based catalysts. The relative stability of ethoxy species and, in general, the relatively good stability of ethoxy and particularly ester species at the surface seem as the main origin for the large number of products observed [162,163]. Bimetallic catalysts with Ni are, as mentioned, rather common [146,164] but also with noble or semi-noble metals such as Ir or Ru. A number of bimetallic systems have shown superior performance than cobalt alone catalysts [146,155,157,164,165]. It can be also mentioned that the surface doping of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) by potassium species was shown to control the reduction, limiting the presence of zero valent Co and limiting acetone and other by-products, increasing carbon selectivity to CO2 and decreasing carbon deposition [166]. In most of these systems, ceria-zirconia with fluorite structure, rather than ceria, was used due to the greater thermal stability as well as oxygen handling properties. Using ZnO and typically the combination of this oxide with ceria as support(s), there is a significant number of works concerning reforming reactions of bio-alcohols with cobalt based catalysts [167,168]. Results are similar to the ceria case, although the formation of by-products seems higher. An example is the reforming of ethanol and the persistent presence of acetaldehyde at the surface [167]. As a singular case to be highlighted is the reforming of bio-butanol. The mixture of butanol, acetone and ethanol, produced by microorganism fermentation routes were subjected to reforming in presence or absence of oxygen [169,170]. In such reaction, the promotion of cobalt by nickel and noble metals, particularly, rhodium seems to provide active, reasonably stable but relatively unselective catalysts. The complex reaction disallows a clear conclusion about the specific role of the ad-metal although their inherent good properties in reforming reactions are obviously contributing to the enhancement of activity."
4,Challenges and conclusions,"World's current energy demands and foreseen demands in the upcoming years would promote the development of pollution-free alternative sources of energy. Hydrogen obtained from natural resources and, particularly, oxygenated molecules, would serve as a versatile energy carrier in this regard. The purpose of this review was to give a comprehensive update of various developments in the field of hydrogen production from oxygenated molecules using base metal catalysts. To this end, we have documented an overview of the water gas shift and steam reforming processes but also the relation of them (particularly the last) with other methods or processes like partial oxidation, autothermal, supercritical water reforming, CO2-sorption-assisted and thermochemical looping to provide a complete view of the most interesting results of the last years. As both the water gas shift but specially the reforming reactions are usually presented within a complex chemical or reaction network with a significant number of side reactions (such as methanation, CO or other molecules disproportionation, gasification and reverse gasification of carbon and other entities) as well as intermediate species (particularly during reforming reactions) being involved, the study of efficient catalytic formulations would require a global approach to the process, including engineering, physical and chemical aspects of the overall process. This demands the use of a multi-disciplinary vision which does consider the analysis of all relevant aspects of the problem: from basic issues covered by the analysis in detail of nanostructure/activity relationship using preferably model systems/processes to the practical application employing real unconstrained catalysts and reaction mixtures. While several systems, particularly based in copper and nickel, correspond to industrial main processes in hydrogen production, the majority of the systems explored require further elaboration in order to enhance one or several catalytic properties: activity, hydrogen selectivity and stability. In spite of the complexity of the problem and thus the difficulties in finding new solutions, a few issues become clear from the last contributions. In fact, the control of morphology (primary size and shape, porosity) and redox properties of both phases, the metal and the support, as well as the effective control of the coking problems (critically in reforming processes) appear to have prime importance to render new systems with improved performance with respect to current technologies. Among new formulations, we show that novel alternatives actively searched or attempted would consider: (i) the enhancement of the active phase catalytic properties as well as the control of its morphology stability under reaction by alloying or interaction with a second metal or the support, (ii) the control of the support morphology and interaction with the active phase by a combination of two or more carriers as well as doping, and (iii) the modulation of the surface properties of the system as well as the metal–support interaction by using additives or promoters. The wise combination of these three issues is potentially leading to novel formulations which may efficiently carry out the water gas shift or reforming processes with advantages with respect to current technologies."
