0,Introduction,"To alleviate energy shortage and accompanying environmental crisis, enormous efforts have been devoted to exploiting clean and renewable energy [1]. Hydrogen has high energy density and high combustion heat value, which is well consistent with modern energy structure and can be deemed as the most promising energy to substitute increasingly depleted fossil fuel [2,3]. Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen as a prospective pathway to evolve green and sustainable energy has aroused wide attention and intensively studied for several decades. TiO2 was indisputably researched as a photocatalyst that may be applied to actual hydrogen production owing to its high stability, low-cost and non-poisonous features [4–6]. However, the further development and practical application of TiO2 must improve its low utilization of sunlight because of the wide band gap of 3.2 eV. Furthermore, fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs that results in insufficient photogenerated electrons for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution must be conquered. Several strategies have been put forward to modulate the band gap for enhancing the light-harvesting ability and restraining the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of TiO2, such as noble metal doping [7,8], non-metal doping [9–11], defects engineering [12–14], heterojunction constructing [15,16], Z-scheme system forming [17–20] and surface functional group modification [21,22]. Modifying noble metal on photocatalysts is identified as an outstanding method to improve photocatalytic activity, but faces the reality of low reserves and high price. Thereby, seeking a cost-effective non-noble metal substitution to acquire high photocatalytic activity has become an attractive research field. Recently, non-noble metal hydroxides modified photocatalysts have been investigated. TiO2 was modified with Co(OH)2 that can expand the light absorption range and efficiently boost the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution [23,24]. Feng et al. prepared Co(OH)2@PANI hybrid nanosheets with 3D networks and possessed high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction [25]. She et al. improved photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of TiO2 via the interfacial modification of inexpensive Cu(OH)2, which narrowed the energy gap (Eg) and enhanced the visible light response [26]. These modification of transition metal hydroxides on semiconductors can improve photocatalytic performance. Therefore, it may be an effective strategy to boost the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 by interfacial modification of transition metal hydroxides. Up to now, the synthetic strategies of TiO2-based semiconductors are mainly liquid-phase and gas-phase methods [27], the interfacial modification of TiO2-based photocatalysts for hydrogen production by solid-state chemical reaction is seldom reported. Herein, we constructed Co(OH)2-TiO2 nanocomposites by a facile room temperature solid-state chemical strategy, which possessed the merits of environmental friendliness and mild synthetic condition. This work provides an effective interfacial modification of transition metal hydroxide on commercial TiO2 (P25) under room temperature condition, which narrows the band gap, expands the light absorption range and facilitates the separation and migration rate of photogenerated carriers. Thus, the as-prepared Co(OH)2-TiO2 nanocomposite exhibits superior photocatalytic performance with hydrogen production rate of 21343.01 μmol g−1, which is 23 times superior to commercial TiO2. Finally, the possible mechanism for the boosted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was raised."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All chemical reagents were commercially available and directly used without further purification. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) was directly purchased from Degussa. Cobalt acetate (Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O) was analytical grade (99.5%) and obtained from Guangfu Institute of Fine Chemical Research, Tianjin, China. Polyethylene glycol-400 (PEG-400) was bought from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was analytical grade (96.0%) and acquired from Tianjin Baishi Chemical Co., Ltd. Methanol solution (CH3OH) was analytically pure (99.5%) and was gained from Tianjin Baishi chemical Co., Ltd."
3,Materials synthesis,"2.2 Materials synthesis Co(OH)2-TiO2 hybrids were synthesized by room-temperature solid-state chemical reaction. The molar ratios of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O to P25 were 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, 1%. Different mole quantity of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O and 0.5 g P25 were weighed and mixed in an agate mortar, ground for 15 min. Subsequently, 1.0 mL PEG-400 was added into the mixture and ground for 15 min to ensure homogeneous mixing. Last, NaOH, which was three-time number of moles more than Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O added into the mixture and ground for 30 min. During the grinding process, it could be clearly observed that the color of mixtures were slightly deepened. The obtained mixtures were washed with distilled water for several times by a circulating water vacuum pump (SHZ-D, Shanghai Dongxi refrigeration equipment Co., Ltd.) and the total amount of distilled water was 1500 mL. During the washing process, the PEG-400 was completely washed off. Then the samples dried naturally at room temperature for 24 h, collecting the powder for the further use. The Co(OH)2-TiO2 photocatalysts were obtained from the following chemical equation. Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O + 2NaOH = Co(OH)2 + 2CH3COONa + 4H2O Co(OH)2 + TiO2 = Co(OH)2-TiO2 For comparison, the photocatalysts were labeled as TCO-X (X = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, representing the 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, 1% molar ratios of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O to P25). The schematic illustration of synthetic procedure was presented in Fig. 1 ."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Various characterization techniques and testing conditions are indicated detailedly in supporting information, including X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), Raman curves, Fourier transformed infrared spectrogram (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), elemental mapping, nitrogen adsorption and desorption spectra, ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), Mott schottky (M-S) plots, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, transient photocurrent density response curves, surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution evaluation,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution evaluation 0.1 g as-obtained photocatalyst was put into a quartz reactor and uniformly dispersed in 75.0 mL ultrapure water with ultrasonic treatment for 10 min, then 25.0 mL methyl alcohol was added and served as sacrificial agent. Before light irradiation of 300 W Xenon lamp (350–780 nm, CEL-HXF300), the whole analytic system must be vacuumized for 20 min to remove excess gases to ensure the accuracy of the hydrogen evolution evaluation. The distance between light source and mixed solution was about 12 cm. The activity of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was evaluated by photocatalytic water splitting online appraisal system (CEL-SPH2NP). The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance was monitored by thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at every hour and analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC-7920, Aulight, China), nitrogen acted as carrier gas and originated from PGT-300 Nitrogen Hydrogen & Air Generator (5 A molecular sieve column). During the whole experiment, a continuous magnetic stirrer was used at the bottom of quartz reactor in order to keep the photocatalyst in suspension. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of Co(OH)2-TiO2 nanohybrids was tested on one system and the whole testing system was operated under the constant temperature of 6.0 °C by the condensate device (LX-300, Beijing Changliu Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd.). The cycling stability experiment was the same as the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution measurement. In a typical experiment, 0.1 g photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed in 25% (v/v) methanol solution and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was evaluated under the irradiation of 300 W Xenon lamp (350–780 nm). After each consecutive cycle, 3.0 mL methanol was added into the mixed solution to compensate the volatilization during the testing process."
6,Results and discussion,
7,The phase and chemical composition of as-obtained photocatalysts,"3.1 The phase and chemical composition of as-obtained photocatalysts The X-ray powder diffraction was utilized as a technique to investigate phase and composition of a series of TCO samples. XRD patterns in Fig. 2 (a) indicate several apparent peaks locate at 2θ = 25.3°, 37.7°, 48.0° and 53.9°, which are corresponding to (101), (004), (200) and (105) planes of the anatase-phase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21–1272). There are three characteristic diffraction peaks emerge at 27.4°, 36.0° and 41.2° that are well indexed to (110), (101) and (111) planes belong to rutile phase of TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1276). With the increasing quantity of compound, there is no distinct change to the structure and crystalline of P25. In addition, no evident diffraction peaks are seen to affiliate to Co(OH)2, it should be a small amount of Co(OH)2 participates in the photocatalysts. Pure Co(OH)2 was fabricated by solid-state synthetic strategy and the corresponding XRD pattern was shown in Fig. S1. Four peaks located at 19.0°, 32.4°, 37.9° and 51.4° are distinctly indexed to (001), (100), (101) and (102) planes of Co(OH)2 (JCPDS No 30–0443), indicating that the solid-state chemical route is an effective strategy to prepare Co(OH)2. The XRD results indicate that the room temperature solid-state chemical method can synthesize Co(OH)2-TiO2 nanocomposites, but the small amount of Co(OH)2 leads to no evident diffraction peaks of Co(OH)2 in TCO-0.6. EDS was carried out to confirm the composition of Co(OH)2-TiO2 nanocomposites. As displayed in Fig. 2(b), Ti, O and Co elements account for 56.89 At%, 37.74 At% and 0.45 At% respectively, indicating the existence of Co and is in low content. Raman spectrometer works as a sensitive and efficient apparatus based on vibration of molecular bonds can determine the structure of samples. As presented in Fig. 2(c), Raman spectra exhibit the characteristic peaks of TCO-0.6 are similar to P25 and mainly seated at 144.2 cm−1, 396.8 cm−1, 517.6 cm−1, 638.7 cm−1. The peak positions do not shift, so we speculate that the composition of Co(OH)2 do not change the structure of P25. From FTIR spectra (depicted in Fig. 2(d)), it is clearly observed that an apparent peak centered at 453.6–786.4 cm−1 can be assigned to the characteristic peak of P25. The characteristic peaks of TCO-0.6 resemble that of P25 and it may the small amount of Co(OH)2 in as-obtained TCO-0.6. Besides, no characteristic peaks of PEG-400 were detected, indicating PEG-400 was filtered completely. The characteristic peaks of pure Co(OH)2 are seated at ~499.8 cm−1 and ~3635.2 cm−1. The peaks located at 1635.4 cm−1 and 3414.5 cm−1 are attributed to OH bond of adsorbed H2O. The peak seated at 1377.4 cm−1 can be assigned to the bending mode of water molecule [28,29]. To further confirm the existence of Co(OH)2, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to examine the surface chemical element composition and valence state of as-obtained TCO-0.6. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), Co, Ti, O and C elements are detected distinctly, which is in accordance with EDS result. From high resolution Co 2p spectrum presented in Fig. 3(b), Co 2p spectrum can be typically split into two peaks at ~781.1 eV and ~797.0 eV, which are assigned to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, separately. These two major binding energy peaks are indexed to Co2+ in Co(OH)2, demonstrating the formation of Co(OH)2 [30]. In addition, two homologous satellite peaks are placed at ~787.0 eV and ~802.0 eV. Seen from Fig. 3(c), the peaks at 458.8 eV and 464.6 eV are matched with Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, which can be ascribed to Ti4+ in TiO2. As exhibited in Fig. 3(d), O 1s spectrum can be divided into two peaks, which are situated at 529.8 eV and 531.5 eV. Wherein, the peak at 529.8 eV is ascribed to the surface absorbed hydroxide radical [31] and the characteristic oxygen peak at 531.5 eV is vested in TiO2. The proportion of Co 2p, Ti 2p and O 1s in TCO-0.6 is indicated in Table S1. The Co 2p, Ti 2p, O 1s account for 0.50%, 24.34% and 53.91%, respectively. The XPS analysis confirms that the Co(OH)2-TiO2 composites are successfully prepared by room temperature solid-state method. Fig. S2 compares the XPS spectra of TCO-0.6 and P25. The characteristic peaks of Ti 2p and O 1s shift after modifying Co(OH)2, which proves the interaction between Co(OH)2 and P25. Furthermore, the ICP-OES was employed to confirm the real contents of Co, Ti and O. As exhibited in Table S2, the real content of Co accounts for 0.56% in TCO-0.6, which is corresponding to the results of EDS and XPS."
8,Morphology and microstructure of as-obtained photocatalysts,"3.2 Morphology and microstructure of as-obtained photocatalysts Field emission scanning electron microscope was implemented to observe micromorphology features and elemental distribution of as-prepared photocatalysts. From Figs. 4 (a-b) and S3, the morphology of P25 is uniform particles with average particle size of 27.1 nm. The TCO-0.6 possesses a morphology of homogeneous nanoparticles with an average size of 31.5 nm. The HRTEM was surveyed to explore microstructure of P25 and TCO-0.6 in Fig. 4(c-e) and Fig. S4, demonstrating that P25 and TCO-0.6 nanoparticles possess the same morphology and homogeneously distributed. The lattice fringe of TCO-0.6 is 0.352 nm and consistent with (101) lattice plane of anatase-phase P25. The elemental mapping images in Fig. 4(f) verify the as-prepared photocatalyst presenting particle-like shape and the element Ti, O and Co are evenly distributed into TCO-0.6. It can be explicitly realized that Co occupies low content, which is in accordance with the EDS results, proportion in XPS analysis and ICP-OES analysis. From Fig. S5, it can be clearly observed that the P25 is coated by a layer of substance. Combining the mapping and XPS analysis, it can be attributed to the small quantity of Co(OH)2 modified on the surface of P25 in an amorphous state. Moreover, the nitrogen adsorption and desorption results are shown in Fig. S6 and Table S3, which indicate that the pore diameters of P25 and TCO-0.6 are 2.15 nm and 1.34 nm."
9,Optical and electrical properties of as-obtained photocatalysts,"3.3 Optical and electrical properties of as-obtained photocatalysts To investigate the characteristic of harvesting the light and determine the band structure of as-prepared photocatalysts, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), Tauc plots and M-S plots were analyzed. As manifested in Fig. 5 (a), it is apparent that the colours of TCO-X photocatalysts are increasingly deepened with the increasing amount of Co(OH)2. The change of colour has a posive effect on light absorption and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. As displayed in Fig. 5(b), the absorption edges of TCO-X photocatalysts shift towards higher wavelength compared with P25. And the interfacial modification of Co(OH)2 can notably broaden the absorption range of commercial P25 and extend to visible light scope of 500–650 nm, therefore interfacial modification is effective to dramatically enhance light-harvesting ability. The Tauc plots are shown in Fig. 5(c), the Eg value of P25 is evaluated at 3.2 eV, which is the same as reported value. However, the Eg value of as-synthesized TCO-X serial photocatalysts is about 2.9 eV (the average value of two titania structures), verifying the modification of Co(OH)2 can effectively narrow the band gap. According to the formula of Eg = 1240/λ (eV), the absorption range of as-fabricated photocatalyst is expanded. It is worth noting that M-S plots are tested to determine semiconductor type and further testify how the induced Co(OH)2 modulates the band gap. As presented in Fig. 5(d), the as-obtained photocatalyst is still an n-type semiconductor nature as commercial P25, indicating that the interfacial modification does not change the semiconductor type. Moreover, the flat band potential (Efb) for photocatast TCO-0.6 and P25 are determined to be −0.77 V vs. NHE (normal hydrogen electrode, ENHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197) and −0.69 V vs. NHE, and the conduction band potential of TCO-0.6 and P25 are estimated to be −0.97 and −0.89 V vs. NHE, considering the potential difference (0.1 or 0.2 V) between the flat band potenial and conduction band potential. Specifically, the valence band potential (EVB) of TCO-0.6 and P25 is 1.93 and 2.31 V vs. NHE according to the equation of EVB = ECB + Eg. The band structure alignment and diagrams of P25 and as-synthesized TCO-0.6 are mainfested in Fig. 5(e) and Table S4. From above results, it is clearly noted that the modification of Co(OH)2 on commercial P25 can efficiently narrow the energy band gap, making the conduction band bend upward and shift to the higher energy level. The more negative potential than H+/H2 reduction potential is beneficial to water reduction reaction, therefore better photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance is expected."
10,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution evaluation of as-obtained photocatalysts,"3.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution evaluation of as-obtained photocatalysts The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the-synthesized samples are evaluated by online photocatalytic hydrogen analytic system. From Fig. 6 (a-b), the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution amount of commercial P25 and TCO-X (X = 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8% and 1%) photocatalysts are 921.75, 6149.28, 11527.18, 21343.01, 4194.26, 1690.76 μmol g−1, severally. With the increasing amount of Co(OH)2 modified on commercial P25, photocatalytic activity of as-obtained photocatalysts is gradually enhanced. However, when the Co(OH)2 loading amount beyond 0.6%, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity is gradually minished. As indicated in Fig. S7, the distinct lattice fringe of P25 is surrounded by amorphous state of Co(OH)2 and its quantity exceeds the component in TCO-0.6. Therefore it can be speculated that the excess Co(OH)2 covers active sites, which restrains the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, only a proper amount of Co(OH)2 modified on commercial P25 can dramatically boost photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. It is impressively observed in Fig. 6(a-b) that the maximum amount of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of specimen TCO-0.6 is 21343.01 μmol g−1, which is 23-fold superior to commercial P25 and exceeds photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of several reported TiO2-based catalysts in Table S5. The stability of the TCO-0.6 nanocomposite is embodied by cycling tests of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in Fig. 6(c). Within 4 photocatalytic cycling tests (20 h), the photocatalytic properties do not decline remarkably. The XPS spectra of reused TCO-0.6 (labeled as TCO-0.6-Reused) and fresh sample are compared in Fig. S8. It can be clearly observed that Co, Ti and O elements are presented in samples. After photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, the two characteristic peaks of Co 2p spectrum seated at 781.1 eV and 797.0 eV are assigned to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. The unchanged peak position demonstrates the stability of Co(OH)2-TiO2 nanocomposite. The phase structure (in Fig. 6(d)) and elemental mapping (in Fig. S9) of photocatalyst after cycling tests also have no difference with the sample before irradiation, which further indicate the high stability of photocatalysts."
11,Possible causes of performance improvement,"3.5 Possible causes of performance improvement In order to investigate the possible causes of TCO-X nanocomposites with appreciable hydrogen evolution performance, several optical and photoelectric characterizations were implemented to study the essential difference between as-fabricated photocatalysts and P25. Steady-state PL emission spectra (from Fig. 7 (a)) were achieved with an excitation wavelength of 250 nm and conducted to indicate the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. As expected, all TCO-X photocatalysts exhibit the quenched PL intensity compared with P25 and the peak intensity of TCO-0.6 is the lowest, which suggest that the recombination of electron-hole is severely obstructed. This can be attributed to the electrons are excited from valence band to conduction band of P25 and then transfer to Co(OH)2, suppressing the recombination of electron-hole pairs and favoring excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity [32]. This process is clearly confirmed by TRPL spectra. The attenuations of TCO-0.6 and commercial P25 are fitted by three-exponential dynamics and the three component data are summarized in Table S6. The average decay time (<τ>) can be calculated by the following equation [33,34]: < τ > = A 1 τ 1 2 + A 2 τ 2 2 + A 3 τ 3 2 A 1 τ 1 + A 2 τ 2 + A 3 τ 3 As presented in Fig. 7(b), the TCO-0.6 shows longer average lifetime of charge carriers than commercial P25 (15.56 ns vs 14.46 ns), implying that the interfacial modification can restrain the recombination of electron-hole pairs and prolong the lifetime of photo-induced carriers. The EPR spectroscopy was employed to determine the separation and transfer efficiency of charge carriers of as-obtained TCO-0.6 and P25. As exhibited in Fig. 7(c), the peak intensity of TCO-0.6 is stronger than commercial P25 in dark condition, suggesting the as-obtained TCO-0.6 owns more electrons. After irradiating for 5 min, it can be clearly observed that the peak intensity of both photocatalysts signally enhance and the signal of TCO-0.6 is still higher than P25, suggesting the modification of Co(OH)2 can accelerate the separation and migration of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, therefore more photo-induced electrons in TCO-0.6 can boost photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Fig. 7(d) compares the transient photocurrent densities response for as-prepared TCO-0.6 and P25 during on–off cycles under the UV–vis light illumination. Clearly, an enhanced photocurrent response of TCO-0.6 can be detected and the maximum photocurrent density is 61.8 μA cm−2, revealing TCO-0.6 has better separation ability of charge carriers than P25, supporting better photocatalytic performance. This result further emphasizes the significance of the interfacial modification and agrees with the EPR analysis. The SPS curves of TCO-0.6 and P25 are shown in Fig. 7(e), it can be obviously found that there is a sharp increase for TCO-0.6. By contrast, the SPS signal of P25 shifts to lower wavelength, which may result from a built-in field in semiconductor driven by the high applied voltage. The build-in field promotes the separation of photogenerated carriers and accelerates the movement of photo-induced electrons to the surface of semiconductors. Meanwhile, the light response range of TCO-0.6 is relatively wider than commercial P25, which is corresponding to UV–vis DRS. The abundant electrons in built-in field weaken the binding energies between nucleus and ambient electrons, accounting for light in longer wavelength excites more electrons to conduction band [35]. Moreover, the EIS plots were tested to reflect the charge transfer efficiency between the surface of photocatalyst and electrode. As shown in Fig. 7(f), the arc radius of as-obtained photocatalyst TCO-0.6 is smaller than P25 under dark and UV–vis irradiation condition, indicating that the charge transfer resistance of TCO-0.6 is smaller than commercial P25, which means that the modification of Co(OH)2 facilitates the migration rate of charges and accelerates the separation of photogenerated carriers, thus improves photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. From the above results, we deduce the possible causes for the excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of TCO-X samples. The modification of Co(OH)2 on commercial P25 greatly narrows the band gap and broadens the light absorption range, leading to the conduction band more negative and the light-capturing ability of photocatalyst is enhanced. Co(OH)2 reacts as a co-catalyst can supply more Co2+ and obtain Co0 by the photo-reduction, then the Co0 can be reoxidized to Co(OH)2 in a short time. The reaction between Co2+ and Co can enhance the photocatalytic performance [23]. Furthermore, the Co(OH)2-TiO2 nanocomposites can severely restrict the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, accelerate the separation and migration rate of photogenerated carriers and facilitate the transfer of more photo-induced electrons to the surface of semiconductor for water reduction reaction. Thus, Co(OH)2-TiO2 nanocomposites dramatically boost the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity."
12,Conclusion,"In conclusion, this work demonstrates an effective strategy to construct Co(OH)2-TiO2 nanocomposites via delicate interfacial modification and band modulation under room temperature. By quantifying Co(OH)2, the band gap of commercial P25 is narrowed and the light absorption ability is strengthened, therefore supporting high photocatalytic activity. As an efficient and low-cost catalyst, the optimal TCO-0.6 exhibits excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of 21343.01 μmol g−1, which is 23 folds superior to commercial P25 and exceeds several reported TiO2-based photocatalysts. Combining photocatalytic performance and the results of photoelectrical tests, it is confirmed that the matched band alignment caused by interfacial modification of Co(OH)2 efficiently expedites the separation and migration velocity of photo-induced carriers. This work not only provides a facile method to synthesize highly active photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution, but also reveals a kind of promising avenue to improve photocatalytic activity of TiO2."
