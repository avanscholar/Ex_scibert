0,Introduction,"At present, global energy demand still is mainly dependent on fossil fuels. However, as non-renewable energy sources these fossil fuels will be quickly exhausted in the near future [1,2]. With the economic globalization and population growth, the energy demand of the whole world will be more and more large in the future. In order to solve the energy demand problem, developing clean and renewable energies are particularly significant [3]. Fortunately, hydrogen as a zero-emission fuel and renewable energy is a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuel [4–6]. Traditionally, water-gas separation reaction and natural gas-steam reaction are common hydrogen production strategies in industry [7,8]. Nonetheless, these processes release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air, which are responsible for the greenhouse effects and climate changes [9,10]. Photocatalytic splitting of water combined with solar energy can produce clean hydrogen energy. At the same time, adding some substances as sacrificial agents with strong reducibility, such as organic pollutant in wastewater, can not only achieve high-efficient hydrogen production, but also purify the water environment [11–13]. In the past few years, massive efforts have been made in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production, but there are still some problems, such as low utilization rate of sunlight, high cost of raw materials and easy recombination of electron-hole pairs. Therefore, to realize the practical application of photocatalytic technology in hydrogen production using organic pollutant as sacrificial agent, it is peculiarly urgent to develop novel photocatalysts with high utilization rate of sunlight and low recombination of electron-hole pairs [14,15]. Most of wide-band gap semiconductor photocatalysts can exhibit high catalytic activity [16,17]. However, they can only absorb ultraviolet light to carry out photocatalytic reactions. And that, the proportion of ultraviolet light in sunlight is very small (about 4 %), resulting in the low utilization rate of sunlight. Some up-conversion luminescent agents used in recent years, such as Y2SiO5:Pr3+,Li, Er3+:Y3Al5O12, BaGd2ZnO5:Yb3+,Pr3+ and NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+, can convert low-energy light combine in solar energy into high-energy light, thus improving the utilization rate of sunlight [18–21]. However, most of the up-conversion luminescent agent particles were used in the form of directly combining with semiconductor or coated by semiconductor, which is not conducive to the transmission, absorption and conversion of light. If the prepared semiconductor particles have both photocatalytic property and light conversion property concurrently, then the above problems can be effectively solved. For example, Yb3+ and Er3+ ions are co-doped in WO3 forming WO3:Yb3+,Er3+, which greatly improves the photocatalytic activity through itself excellent light conversion performance. However, because of the positive conduction band potential, WO3 cannot be used for photocatalytic hydrogen production [22]. The above problem can be solved well using the recently proposed Z-scheme photocatalytic system based on simulating natural photosynthesis process [23]. Compared with the traditional heterojunction structure, the Z-scheme photocatalytic system can achieve the high-efficient separation of electron-hole pairs and retain the high oxidation and reduction potentials. Furthermore, the utilization rate of sunlight can also be considerably improved. Therefore, it is necessary to combine WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ with other photocatalysts with good performance and negative conduction band potential to form a Z-scheme photocatalytic system to synchronously degrade pollutants and produce hydrogen. For example, the combination of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ and Ag3VO4 (ECB = -0.53 eV and EVB = +1.42 eV) (a narrow-band gap semiconductor) can form an ideal Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 photocatalytic system. The Z-scheme electron transfer direction is from the conduction band of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ to the valence band of Ag3VO4. The net result is that the remainder electrons and holes are located on the conduction band of Ag3VO4 and the valence band of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+, respectively, which have strong redox abilities to carry out redox reaction simultaneously. It is worth mentioning that the loading of nano-sized noble metals (for example, Au, Ag and Pt) on the surface of semiconductor photocatalyst is a promising method to improve the photocatalytic activity [24–26]. In particular, the recent studies showed the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect induced by nano-sized noble metals could reinforce the functions of electronic channels and cocatalysts [27–30]. That is, the collective oscillation of electrons on the surface of noble metal nanoparticles can stimulate SPR effect and produce high-energy thermal electrons under visible light irradiation. As electronic channel, due to the SPR effect the Ag-NPs can transfer the electrons on their surface to Ag3VO4 valence band, combining with holes, so as to promoting the separation of photo-induced carriers. As cocatalyst, due to the same SPR effect the Ag-NPs generate a large number of electrons on the surface, which can effectively promote the production of hydrogen. And the holes themselves are neutralized by the photo-generated electrons from Ag3VO4. In this work, a novel Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst was successfully prepared by hydrothermal and high temperature calcination methods for hydrogen production. The efficiency of hydrogen production can be improved by using organic molecules as sacrificial reagents. Numerous organic compounds have been reported for the photocatalytic hydrogen production process [31,32]. Also, in the study, the levofloxacin (LEV) was used as a sacrificial agent to boost the hydrogen production. The crystal structure, microstructure morphology, optical properties, chemical composition and elemental states of prepared samples were characterized in detail. Based on the SPR effect, the Ag-NPs were introduced as electronic channel and cocatalyst to facilitate electrons transfer and enhance hydrogen production amount. The effects of sunlight irradiation time, sacrificial agent concentration and cycle times on the photocatalytic activity of samples were studied. In particular, the up-conversion emission spectrum of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ and the corresponding energy conversion mechanism were investigated. In addition, the photocatalytic reaction mechanism in hydrogen production and pollutant degradation was discussed on basis of the active species capture experiment and ESR analyses."

In the first place, 3.00 g Na2WO4·2H2O, 0.0719 g Yb2O3 and 0.0698 g Er2O3 were dissolved in hot nitric acid. And then the resulting solution was dissolved in ethanol, forming a yellow solution. Subsequently, the yellow solution was then transferred to the autoclave maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. After the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the obtained substance was washed with deionized water and absolute ethyl alcohol for several times. Afterwards, the obtained powers were dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ was successfully synthesized after air annealing at 300 °C for 2.0 h."

Solution A and Solution B were mixed and stirred for 30 min to adjust the pH of the reaction mixture to 10 with 4 mol/L NaOH solution. The mixed solution was transferred to 250 mL three-necked flask and stirred at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, centrifugal washing and drying were performed to obtain orange Ag3VO4 powder."
5,Preparation of Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag powder,"2.4 Preparation of Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag powder The Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag nanoparticles were prepared by photoreduction method [35]. 1.50 g Ag3VO4 powder was dissolved in 20 mL ethanol and adequately dispersed by ultrasound ultrasonic for 10 min. The suspension was irradiated with a 300 W xenon lamp and heated at 50 °C for 1.0 h in order to absorb Ag+ and reduce it to Ag. After repeated centrifugation, it was washed with deionized water and dried overnight at 70 °C for 12 h. Finally, the Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag powder was obtained."

WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ and Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag powders were proportionally added into a 100 mL beaker containing 50 mL deionized water. The above mixture was fully dispersed for 30 min to obtain uniform suspension. The suspension was stirred by magnetic stirring apparatus and heated the boiling point for 30 min. WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag powder was collected by centrifugation. The powder was washed several times with deionized water and ethanol. Then, the suspension was dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, the powder was heated in a muffle furnace for 300 °C for 2.0 h."
7,Analytical methods,2.6 Analytical methods The crystalline structures of prepared samples were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The morphological features of as-prepared samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The optical properties of as-prepared samples were examined by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The separation efficiency of photo-generated electron-hole pairs was analyzed by photoluminescence spectrum (PL). The transient photocurrent response (TPR) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were measured by electrochemical system. The electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were carried out to examine the generation of O H generated. A photochemical reaction apparatus was used during the experiment. The degradation rate of LEV in aqueous solution was determined in UV–vis spectrometer.
8,Photocatalytic degradation with synchronous hydrogen evolution,"2.7 Photocatalytic degradation with synchronous hydrogen evolution The photocatalytic activity of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag composite was evaluated by degradation of LEV with synchronous hydrogen production under sunlight irradiation. A 300 W xenon lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter CO2, H2O and some inorganic ions as used as light source. In photocatalytic degradation experiment, 50 mg photocatalysts were dispersed into 100 mL solution and then placed in the dark with constant stirring for 30 min to achieve the adsorption and desorption equilibrium. 4 mL suspension was sampled every 30 min. The concentrations of LEV were measured by using UV–vis spectrophotometer. After the absorbance test, the solution is poured back into the original solution in the darkness. The degradation efficiency (%) is calculated by the formula: Ct/C0 = At/A0, where A0 is the absorbance of original LEV solution before illumination and At represents the instant absorbance of LEV solution after certain irradiation time (t). The photocatalytic H2 production was implemented in a Pyrex irradiation vessel connected with closed gas circulation and pumping system (Labsolar-6A, Perfectlight corporation, China). 0.50 g photocatalyst was dispersed into 500 mL LEV (50 mg/L) aqueous solution, and the suspension was transferred to a circular reactor with bottom area of 64 cm2 and height of 10 cm. Then, the suspension was stirred in darkness to get adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Afterwards, a 300 W Xenon lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Perfectlight corporation, China) equipped with 420 nm filter was used as simulated sunlight source. The intensity of light source is 100 mW/cm2 and the distance between lamp and liquid surface is 20 cm. Before the light irradiation, the system was pumped by N2 for 30 min to remove the dissolved air and maintain anaerobic environment. Subsequently, the system was irradiated for 180 min. The production hydrogen was periodically analyzed with a gas chromatograph. In addition, the apparent quantum efficiency (QE) of samples was determined by using a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Perfectlight corporation, China) with a filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). The 300 W xenon lamp was positioned 20 cm away from the flask. The number of incident photons from the xenon lamp was measured using a power meter (1831-R, Newport Corporation, USA). The apparent quantum efficiency (QE (%)) of samples was calculated according to following equation: Q E % = number of reacted electrons number of incidentphotons × 100 = number of evolved hydrogen molecules × 2 number of incidentphotons × 100"
9,Results and discussion,
10,"XRD, SEM, EDX, TEM, XPS, Raman, DRS, PL, TPR and EIS of prepared samples","3.1 XRD, SEM, EDX, TEM, XPS, Raman, DRS, PL, TPR and EIS of prepared samples The measurements of X-ray diffractions (XRD) were conducted to investigate the crystalline structures of prepared samples. As displayed in Fig. 1 a-1, the main diffraction peaks of prepared WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ locate at 2θ values of 23.15°, 23.61°, 24.37°, 28.96°, 33.30°, 34.19° and 41.92°, respectively, corresponding to (002), (020), (200), (112), (022), (202) and (222) facets of WO3 (JCPDS# 72-1465) in Fig. 1a-3 [36]. In addition, these diffraction peaks are also basically consistent with those (in Fig. 1a-2) of pure WO3 sample. Because of low mole percentage, the peaks from Yb3+ and Er3+ cannot be seen clearly. However, the subsequent characterizations can prove their existences. As shown in Fig. 1b-1, some diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 19.20°, 30.86°, 32.33°, 35.07°, 35.94° and 38.92° can be discovered, respectively, which are well matched with (011), (-121), (121), (301), (202) and (022) of mono-clinic α-Ag3VO4 (JCPDS# 43-0542) in Fig. 1b-2 [37]. In Fig. 1d, besides the diffraction peaks of Ag3VO4, three pronounced peaks of Ag at 2θ values of 38.12°, 44.28° and 64.43° also can be found corresponded with Fig. 1c (JCPDS# 04-0783), indicating that Ag NPs have been successfully introduced by using photo-reduction method. As depicted in Fig. 1e, the characteristic diffraction peaks of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ and Ag3VO4 can be seen, which manifests that a binary WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 composite is formed. In Fig. 1f, the diffraction peaks of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+, Ag3VO4 and Ag all can be observed simultaneously. Ulteriorly, Rietveld analysis is a quantitative method based on XRD test, which takes known crystal structure information as reference and combines with peak function to perform fitting calculation on the diffraction pattern, so as to obtain crystal structure parameters and phase composition. The WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst is refined by Rietveld analyses. The obtained pattern is shown in Fig. 1g. It can be observed that the relative errors between the calculated and observed values are quite small, which proves an excellent crystal phase structure. In addition, the accuracy of profile fitting is assessed by the low values of GOF (1.3) together with the reliability parameters of Rwp (4.84 %), Rp (3.46 %) and χ2 (1.69). The above results indicate that the desired high purity target WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst may be successfully prepared. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement can provide direct observation of morphological features of the as-prepared photocatalysts. It can be observed from Fig. 2 a that the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles present a cuboid geometric feature of 80−100 nm length, 70−80 nm width and 20−30 nm thickness [38]. As shown in Fig. 2b, the pure Ag3VO4 nanoparticles with length of 100−120 nm, width of 80−100 nm and thickness of 30−50 nm are also some nanoscale-cuboid particles, but they are bigger than WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ a little. As exhibited in Fig. 2c, two kinds of cuboid particles are combined to form the direct Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 photocatalytic system. From the point of view of morphologies, the close-connected nano-cuboid particles may make electrons transfer easier. And also, the combination of two particles with nano-cuboid morphology could provide the abundant redox reaction sites for organic molecules degradation, thereby improve the photocatalytic performance. As presented in Fig. 2d, some small spherical nanoparticles with dimeter of 10−20 nm can be seen on the both sides of Ag3VO4, demonstrating Ag NPs have successfully deposited on the surface of Ag3VO4 by using photo-reduction method. To sum up, it can be deduced that the Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst has been successfully obtained. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) can be used to analyze the microstructure of the prepared samples and connection way among components. Fig. 3 a displays the composition components and positional relationships of Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst. Combining with SEM images, it can be judged that the black bulk particles on the left are Ag3VO4 and smaller black particles on the right are WO3:Yb3+,Er3+. Ulteriorly, The Ag NPs are distributed in two main places. It can be observed that Ag NPs with an average size of around 10 nm are sandwiched between WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ and Ag3VO4 and other Ag NPs locate on other side of Ag3VO4. Furthermore, in Fig. 3b the HRTEM image gives the lattice fringes of specific substances. The lattice fringe of 0.363 nm is in accordance with (200) crystal plane of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+. Moreover, the lattice fringe of 0.238 nm can be discovered to consistent with the (121) crystal plane of Ag3VO4. Two lattice fringes of 0.236 nm sandwiched between WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ and Ag3VO4 and on other side of Ag3VO4 both can be found, which both belong to Ag NPs. Based on above calculations and analyses, the predicted Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst has been successfully prepared. The Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDS) mapping measurement is used to analyse the elemental composition and distribution situation in Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst and results are displayed in Fig. 4 . The electron image and layered image are also given in the Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The close-connection morphology feature of nano-cuboid particles can be seen in the electron image for Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst. In addition, through the layered mapping image, it is visibly found that W, V, Yb, Er, Ag and O elements dyed in different colors exist in the prepared sample. Ulteriorly, the respective mapping images are also given using a specific colour tag in Fig. 4(b-1−6). The densely distributed W, Ag and V elements substantiate that the photocatalyst consists of two main components of WO3 and Ag3VO4. Since the O element is existed in WO3 and Ag3VO4, the content distribution is the widest and the most even in the prepared sample. In the end, the distribution of Yb and Er elements is low on account of the fact that the content percentages are relatively small in the prepared sample. The elemental composition and content percentage of prepared sample were analyzed by using the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. In Fig. 4c, the characteristic peaks of all elements in the prepared sample can be found clearly, which verifies that the photocatalyst consists of these elements without other impurities. The characteristic peaks of W, Yb, Er and O elements can be discovered and the presence of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ can be confirmed. Furthermore, the characteristic peaks of V, Ag and O can be detected, vesting in the Ag3VO4 and Ag NPs with SPR effect. These results are basically consistent with the results of XRD, SEM and TEM. The content percentage is similar to the theoretical value in WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag. In addition, the percentage composition of Er, Yb, Ag, V and W elements also were measured by ICP and the results are displayed in Table S1. It can be found that the results of atomic ratios are close to that of EDX, substantiating that the expectant Z-scheme photocatalyst has been triumphantly prepared. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were proceeded to determine the surface chemical state and elemental compositions of the as-prepared sample. The full survey in Fig. 5 a substantiates that W, Er, Yb, V, Ag and O elements exist in the Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 5b, two peaks at 34.2 eV and 36.3 eV can correspond to W 2p7/2 and W 2p5/2 orbits of W6+ cations [39], respectively. Fig. 5c shows the binding energies at 168.9 eV and 171.1 eV, which are ascribed to Er 4d7/2 and Er 4d5/2 [40], respectively. In the XPS pattern of Fig. 5d, the peaks located at 184.0 eV and 186.0 eV belong to 4d5/2 and 4d3/2 of Yb element [41], respectively. Fig. 5e displays V 2p XPS spectrum, which can be resolved into two peaks at 515.9 eV and 529.9 eV, respectively, attributing to characteristic signals of V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 of V5+ [42]. As shown in Fig. 5f, the peaks located at 367.5 eV and 373.1 eV belong to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively. Ulteriorly, each peak can be separated into asymmetric two peaks. The peaks of 367.1 eV and 366.9 eV belong to Ag(3d5/2) and the other peaks centered at 373.0 eV and 373.6 eV are ascribed to Ag(3d3/2). The peaks located at 367.1 eV and 373.0 eV are proved to be the characteristic peak of Ag+ in Ag3VO4. The peaks situated in 366.9 eV and 373.6 eV are the characteristic peaks of monoplasmatic Ag. The XPS spectrum of O 1s is presented in Fig. 5g, in which the peaks at 529.3 eV and 529.9 eV are from M–O (W-O and V-O) and adsorbed hydroxyls [43], respectively. The analyses of XPS spectra provide a strong evidence that Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst has been expectedly prepared. The structural analyses of the as-prepared photocatalyst are further performed by using Raman spectrum in Fig. S1. It can be detected that the characteristic peaks centered at 710.22 cm−1 and 928.52 cm−1 are ascribed to the δ (O-W6+-O) stretching vibration mode [44,45]. The peaks at 266.72 cm−1 and 437.77 cm−1 are credited to δ (O-W6+-O) bending vibration mode of WO3 [44,46]. The peak located at 800.30 cm−1 can be observed, corresponding to symmetric VO stretching vibration mode of Ag3VO4 [47]. Besides, the peak at 232.02 cm−1 is attributed to the vibration of Ag/Ag3VO4 [48]. In addition, it also can be confirmed that the peak at 877.72 cm−1 is caused by the SPR effect of Ag NPs [47]. These results mean that the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst may be well prepared. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of as-prepared samples in the range of 250−800 nm were measured to study the optical properties. As can be seen from Fig. 6 a, the WO3 particles displays an absorption edge around 430 nm, demonstrating that WO3 has absorption in ultraviolet region. After doping Yb3+ and Er3+ ions, the absorption intensity of formed WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ is reinforced and range is broadened significantly. The prepared Ag3VO4 indicates an absorption edge nearby 635 nm, which proves that it can both absorb ultraviolet-light and visible-light. It is worth noting that the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 and WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag both give more strong optical absorption compared to single photocatalysts. However, compared with WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4, the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag exhibits more wide range of light absorption and the range even extends to the near-infrared region. This mainly gives the credit to the fact that the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ itself can be used as an up-conversion luminescent agent converting long wavelength light to short wavelength light. Furthermore, the response range of the light is also broadened via construction of Z-scheme photocatalytic system. In particular, compared with WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4, the absorption intensity of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst is significantly enhanced around 460 nm, which indicates the occurrence of SPR effect from Ag NPs (the orange ellipse). The band-gaps of prepared samples can be calculated by Kubelka-Munk function [49]: αhν = A(hν-Ebg)1/2, where α, h, ν, Ebg and A represent absorption coefficient, plank constant, light frequency, band gap and constant, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6b-1 and b-2, the calculated band-gaps of prepared WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ and Ag3VO4 are 2.88 eV and 1.94 eV, respectively. The calculated Ebg values are similar to those in literatures [36,34]. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were recorded under an excitation of 325 nm wavelength light to analyze separation efficiency of photo-generated electrons and holes in Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst. In a general way, a strong PL emission intensity means that a large number of photo-generated electrons return to the ground state, triggering the rapid recombination of electrons and holes [50]. On the contrary, a weak PL emission intensity means that very few photo-generated electrons return to the ground state, thereby the recombination of electrons and holes is inhibited. As displayed in Fig. 7 a, Ag3VO4, WO3:Yb3+,Er3+, WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 and WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag all show the PL spectra in the wavelength range of 350−800 nm. It can be distinctly observed that WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ and Ag3VO4 give high PL intensities, indicating that the recombination rate of their electrons and holes are quite high. By contrast, the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 and WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag composite photocatalysts exhibit relatively low PL intensities. And that, the PL intensity of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag is the lowest, which reveals that the efficient separation of photo-induced electrons and holes in Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst can be further achieved after introducing Ag nanoparticles with SPR effect acted as electronic channel and cocatalyst. The transient photocurrent response (TPR) time curves in Fig. 7b are adopted to disclose the photoelectrochemical properties of photocatalysts. As a rule, the high photocurrent intensity signifies that a large number of photogenerated electrons are generated rapidly and indicates the photocatalyst has high separation efficiency of electrons and holes [51]. The transient photocurrents of Ag3VO4, WO3:Yb3+,Er3+, WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 and WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag all exhibit relatively strong response signals in each light on-off period, displaying that the photons are able to excite the catalysts and the electron transfer processes are rather stable. However, it can be distinctly found that the onefold Ag3VO4 and WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ both exhibit the weak photocurrent intensities, stating that their electrons and holes are effortless to recombine. And that, the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 and WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag both reveal relatively high photocurrent intensities when on light. Compared to direct Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 photocatalyst, the Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag gives a much strong response signal. Concretely, the photocurrent of the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 is 1.6 mA/cm2 after 5 cycles, while that of the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag is 3.1 mA/cm2, representing an approximate 2.0-fold increase, which provides another important evidence for SPR effect of Ag NPs. Therefore, the above analysis results reasonably illustrate that Ag NPs with SPR effect can be utilized as electronic channel and cocatalyst to boost the separation efficiency. To further analyze the charge transfer characteristics of as-prepared samples, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also investigated. Currently, a small arc radius is indicative of a small interfacial charge transfer resistance, giving rise to rapid charge transfer [52]. As displayed in Fig. 7c, Ag3VO4 and WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ have the relatively bigger arc radii, indicating that the electrons transport is subject to great resistance on the interface, thereby cause the electrons to easily recombine with holes. Under the same conditions, the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 and WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag both display small arc radii, demonstrating that the constructed Z-scheme photocatalytic system can more efficiently reduce the transfer resistance of interfacial charge and facilitate transfer of photo-generated electrons. In particular, after introducing Ag-NPs with the SPR effect, WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag shows the smallest arc radius in all the samples, implying minimum resistance and fastest charge transfer. Being comprehensive analyses of PL, TPR and EIS, the outstanding photoelectrochemical property of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag can be confirmed accordingly."
11,Photocatalytic activity of prepared samples,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity of prepared samples The photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared samples were systematically assessed through synchronous photocatalytic degradation of LEV and hydrogen production under solar light irradiation and the results were demonstrated in Figs. 8 and 9 . As shown in Fig. 8a-1, prior to light irradiation, each of the suspensions was placed in the dark for 30 min to achieve adsorption/desorption equilibrium. From the dark experiments it can be seen that, for these four systems, the LEV concentrations all decrease slightly within 30 min in the presence of photocatalysts, illustrating that the prepared photocatalysts all have slight adsorption for LEV. The blank control reveals that the non-catalyzed photocatalytic degradation of LEV is weak in the absence of photocatalyst, confirming LEV is photostable. When these suspensions are irradiated by solar light, the degradation ratios of LEV all increase gradually with prolonging irradiation time. Thereinto, the Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst displays the highest degradation radio in these four samples, indicating that it has the highest photocatalytic performance. The degradation ratio of LEV caused by Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst reaches 90.44 % under solar light irradiation for 180 min. Under the same conditions, the Ag3VO4, WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ and WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4 all exhibit lower photocatalytic degradation activities. The degradation ratios of LEV are 33.67 %, 56.84 % and 63.80 %, respectively. Fig. 8a-2 shows the degradation kinetics curve of LEV. It can be seen that the kinetic curve accords with the requirements of the pseudo-first-order kinetic reactions. The rate constants k(slope) are 0.01219 min−1, 0.00577 min−1, 0.00458 min−1, 0.00222 min−1, respectively, for WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag, WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4, WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ and Ag3VO4. Ulteriorly, the specific k values are presented in Fig. 8a-3. The order of rate constants is consistent with the photocatalytic activity results. Clearly, the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag gives a largest rate constant, displaying the highest photocatalytic performance. Fig. 8b reveals the effects of LEV concentrations on photocatalytic degradation cause by Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst. Under solar light irradiation for 180 min, the degradation ratios of LEV are 90.44 %, 63.37 % and 57.61 %, respectively, for 10 mg/L, 20 mg/L and 30 mg/L concentrations of LEV solutions. It can be confirmed that 10 mg/L LEV concentration is proper for effective photocatalytic degradation. This may be because the high concentration LEV molecules serve as an optical filter and shield a mass of incident lights, thus inhibiting enhancement of photocatalytic degradation of LEV. Usually, the intermediates can be produced during the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. The study on intermediates is very important, due to their various physical, chemical or biological properties, including the toxicity. If directly discharged into the environment, they will show the obvious negative effects. In order to eliminate the toxicity, the complete mineralization of organic pollutants is necessary. In the photocatalytic degradation of LEV, some intermediate products can also be produced. However, due to the particularity of LEV as an antibiotic drug, the produced intermediate products should be non-toxic, which has been verified [53–55]. In this work, the LEV sacrificial agent is used to achieve photocatalytic production of hydrogen. Simultaneously, with the continuous production of hydrogen, the LEV pollutant can be gradually degraded and consumed, until completely mineralized into CO2, H2O and some inorganic ions. In summary, the LEV and its intermediates can be effectively degraded and completely mineralized by Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst under solar light. The photocatalytic performance is also assessed through hydrogen production amount of as-prepared samples. Fig. 9a displays the change trends of cumulative hydrogen production amounts for Ag3VO4, WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 and WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag within 180 min. It can be found that the hydrogen production amounts for these three causes all increase with the duration of irradiation time. The pute Ag3VO4 exhibits a minimum hydrogen production amount, which is only 231.10 μmol/g under sunlight for 180 min. Subsequently, after introduction of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ forming Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 photocatalyst, the hydrogen production amount increased dramatically, which can attain 345.22 μmol/g under same conditions. And that, the Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst gives a highest hydrogen production amount in three samples, which can reach to 489.02 μmol/g. The increased photocatalytic performance closely related to the successful construction of Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalytic system, which can reserve the strong positive VB potential and negative CB potential. Posteriorly, the light response range is obviously broadened by the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ with excellent light conversion and photocatalytic performances. And also, the Ag NPs with SPR effect act as electronic channel and cocatalyst vastly accelerate the transfer of photo-generated electrons. Finally, this result may be related with the quantum efficiency. For the Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst, the apparent quantum efficiency (QE (%)) is calculated as about 4.32 % under 420 nm monochromatic light. Moreover, the QE (%) was compared with those of previously reported photocatalysts and the results were exhibited in Table S2. It can be observed that the QE is comparable with reported values in literatures [56–59]. Fig. 9b shows the effect of LEV concentration on the photocatalytic hydrogen production of Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst. It can be discovered that, for three concentrations (10, 30 and 50 mg/L) of LEV solutions, the hydrogen production amounts all rise along with irradiation time. In addition, it can also be found that the hydrogen production amount increases with increase of catalyst dose. When 180 min sunlight irradiation time and 50 mg/L LEV concentration were used, the highest hydrogen production amount (489.02 μmol/g) was gained. This is apparently higher than 345.00 μmol/g for 30 mg/L LEV concentration and 231.13 μmol/g for 10 mg/L LEV concentration. Therefore, the 50 mg/L LEV concentration is the relatively appropriate for photocatalytic hydrogen production. In conclusion, The Z-scheme photocatalyst is suitable for high concentration antibiotic wastewater, which is very valuable in the practical application. The hydrogen production situation caused by Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst was measured using gas chromatography when the sacrificial agent is 50 mg/L LEV solution and the simulated sunlight irradiation time is 180 min. In Fig. 9c only characteristic peak of hydrogen can be observed, demonstrating the acquisition of pure hydrogen. In addition, the hydrogen production amount is further calculated to be 489.02 μmol/g for 180 min based on the characteristic peak area of hydrogen. For any photocatalyst the activity stability is a significant factor. Concretely, the activity stability of the Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst is studied by a five-time cycling test. As shown in Fig. 10 a, the degradation ratio (from 90.44 % to 87.34 %) of LEV does not show noticeable change within five cycling tests, indicating the good activity stability and reusability. In addition, as displayed in Fig. 10b, the change of hydrogen evolution amount is from 489.02 μmol/g to 485.29 μmol/g within five cycling test, indicating a slight change in the whole process. Briefly, it can be conclusively demonstrated that the Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst possess distinguished light stability and reusability for synchronous photocatalytic degradation of LEV and hydrogen production. To prove the structure stability of Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst, the XRD patterns and SEM images before and after (five cycle) uses were compared. As revealed in Fig. 10c, only the characteristic peak intensities of Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst drop slightly, and that the positions are basically same before and after use, which indicates that the good stability can be maintained. In addition, as can be seen from the SEM in Fig. 10d, compared with Fig. 2d, it can be found that the morphology of Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst is hardly changed before and after use. Therefore, after long-term tests, there has been no noticeable change in the morphology and composition for the used photocatalyst, displaying the photocatalyst maintains high level stability under visible light irradiation."
12,"Up-conversion luminescent spectrum and energy level diagram of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+","3.3 Up-conversion luminescent spectrum and energy level diagram of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ The up-conversion luminescent spectrum and schematic energy level diagram of the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ (WO3 nanoparticles doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ ions) were shown in Fig. S2. The rare earth elements, such as Yb and Er, are generally selected as activator and sensitizer, respectively, due to their abundant energy level structure and long luminescence lifetime. All processes start from the absorption of the NIR photons, which moves the electrons from ground state 2F7/2 to excited 2F5/2 levels of activator Yb3+ by the ground state absorption (GSA) [60]. The electrons can immediately drop back to the ground state, but this step is followed by several non-resonant energy transfers to the neighboring Er3+ ions. The emitted spectrum of Er3+ ions is emerged in Fig. S2a. To be specific, an ultraviolet emission peak appears around 430 nm, corresponding to the conversion of 2H9/2 → 4I15/2 in Fig. S2b, which illustrates that the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ can emit ultraviolet light under the excitation of 980 nm wavelength light. A strong green emission peak locates at 524 nm, corresponding to the conversion of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2. A relatively weak laurel-green emission peak is seated at 572 nm, belonging to the conversion of 4G9/2 → 4I13/2. Dexterously, WO3 (λex ≤ 430 nm) and Ag (λex = 500−600 nm) can make good use of the lights emitted by WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ to perform photocatalytic reaction and generate SPR effect, respectively. In short, the infrared light in the sunlight is also adequately utilized and light response range of the Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst is distinctly widened."
13,Possible mechanism on photocatalytic degradation of LEV with synchronous hydrogen production,"3.4 Possible mechanism on photocatalytic degradation of LEV with synchronous hydrogen production It is important to understand what active radical species are responsible and which active species give the main contribution in the photocatalytic degradation caused by Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst. The trapping experiments of the active species were carried out through adding several trapping agents and the results were displayed in Fig. 11 . Specifically, in this experiment the ammonium oxalate (AO), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) are used to trap holes (h+), hydroxyl radicals (O H) and superoxide radicals ( O2 −) [61,62], respectively. Without any trapping agents, the degradation ratio of LEV is 90.44 % under solar light irradiation for 180 min. Nevertheless, when AO and IPA were added, the photocatalytic degradation ratios of LEV were markedly impaired to 35.21 % and 51.15 %, respectively. By contrast, the degradation ratio reaches to 77.65 % in the presence of BQ, which displays a relatively small effect on LEV degradation. These results confirm that the h+, OH and O 2 − work together in photocatalytic degradation, but the h+ and O H are the dominant active species in the photocatalytic degradation process over Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst. The electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were carried out to examine the generations of OH and O 2 − during photocatalytic reaction caused by Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag and WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 composite photocatalysts under dark condition and 10 min illumination. As displayed in Fig. S3, no signals appeared under dark conditions for WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag and WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4, demonstrating that the OH and O 2 − are not be generated. However, under visible light irradiation for 10 min, strong characteristic peaks of DMPO- OH and DMPO-O 2 − are obtained, indicating that OH and O 2 − are produced during the photocatalytic reaction [63]. Moreover, compared with WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4, the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag displays much stronger and stabler signal intensities. Finally, based on the radical trap experiments and ESR analyses, it can be proved that the photocatalytic degradation reaction process was governed together by h+ and O H. Based on above analyses and discussions, a possible mechanism on synchronously photocatalytic degradation of LEV and hydrogen production under solar light irradiation is proposed and the corresponding illustration diagram is presented in Fig. 12 . In a general way, with regard to synchronously photocatalytic degradation of LEV and hydrogen production, the single photocatalyst reveals low utilization capacity of sunlight and separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs in practical application. In recent years, the developed Z-scheme photocatalytic systems can well retain the strong redox capacities and the sunlight response range can also be greatly improved. The metallic oxide WO3 (ECB = +0.56 eV, EVB = +3.44 eV and ΔEbg = +2.88 eV) with a very positive valence band potential can well carry out photocatalytic degradation reaction. However, because of the relatively wide band gap, it can only be excited by absorbing ultraviolet light which accounts for very little percentage of sunlight. In this study, by doping rare earth ions (Yb3+ and Er3+) into WO3, the light absorption range of formed WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ can be greatly broadened. That is to say, the WO3 itself can not only act as a photocatalyst and but also be used as the substrate of the up-conversion fluorescence agent. In addition, Ag3VO4 with a relatively negative valence band potential shows excellent performance of photocatalytic hydrogen production, which can be used to combine with WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ to a new ideal Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 photocatalytic system. Moreover, the Z-scheme photocatalytic reaction mechanism can also be confirmed by above-mentioned trapping experiments and ESR measurement. Specifically, if the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag3VO4 forms a heterojunction photocatalytic system, the photo-generated electrons will transfer from CB/Ag3VO4 to CB/WO3:Yb3+,Er3+, and the photo-generated holes will transfer from VB/WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ to VB/Ag3VO4. If so, the h+ on VB/Ag3VO4 cannot oxidize H2O to O H because the VB/Ag3VO4 potential (+1.42 eV vs. NHE) is lower than E0 (O H/H2O) (+2.27 eV vs. NHE). Therefore, the presence of O H proved that the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ and Ag3VO4 formed a Z-scheme photocatalytic system and not heterojunction photocatalytic system. In a word, because of the construction of Z-scheme photocatalytic system, the strong oxidizability and strong reducibility are retained simultaneously. For this particular WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ photocatalyst, the activator (Yb3+) and sensitizer (Er3+) can convert low energy light to high energy light effectively to carry out photocatalytic reaction. To be specific, the WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ as an up-conversion luminescence agent can absorb near-infrared light (λ =980 nm) in the sunlight and convert it into near-ultraviolet (400−450 nm) and visible (500−600 nm) lights. On the one hand, the emitted ultraviolet light can be absorbed by WO3 to generate photogenerated electron-hole pairs. On the other hand, the emitted visible light from WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ can induce the SPR effect of Ag NPs. As electronic channel, due to the SPR effect the Ag NPs can transfer the electrons on their surface to Ag3VO4 valence band, combining with holes. And the holes of Ag NPs are neutralized by the photo-generated electrons from CB of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+. As cocatalyst, due to the same SPR effect, the Ag NPs generate a large number of electrons on the surface, which can effectively promote the production of hydrogen. And the holes of Ag NPs are neutralized by the photo-generated electrons from CB of Ag3VO4. Therefore, the VB of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ and CB of Ag3VO4 can be simultaneously retained to carry out photocatalytic degradation of LEV with hydrogen production. For the Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst, WO3 and Ag3VO4 both can be excited to produce electrons and holes on their conduction band and valance band under sunlight irradiation. For the oxidation reaction side, the agglomerated photo-generated holes on the VB of WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ are able to oxide LEV to, or oxide H2O/OH− (E(O H/H2O) = +2.38 eV vs. NHE) into O H [64–66]. For the reduction reaction side, the accumulated photo-generated electrons on the CB (ECB = -0.53 eV vs NHE) of Ag3VO4 are capable of picking up H+ ions to form H2 (E(H+/H2) =0.000 eV vs. NHE). In conclusion, based on the Z-scheme electron transfer route, the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs is greatly improved and the utilization rate of sunlight is prominently broadened. Furthermore, the SPR effect caused by Ag NPs can enhance the transfer rate and transfer contents of electrons, improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. In the end, the related mechanism can be summarized as follows: WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag + near-infrared light (in sunlight) → [WO3:Yb3+,Er3+]*/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag [WO3:Yb3+,Er3+]*/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag → hν (λ = 400−450 nm) + hν (λ = 500−600 nm) WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag + hν (λ = 400−450 nm) → [WO3]*:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag [WO3]*:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag → h+/VB/WO3 + e–/CB/WO3 WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag + visible light (in sunlight) → WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/[Ag3VO4]*/Ag WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/[Ag3VO4]*/Ag → h+/VB/ Ag3VO4 + e–/CB/ Ag3VO4 WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag + hν (λ = 500−600 nm) → WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/[Ag]*(SPR)/Ag3VO4/[Ag]*(SPR) WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/[Ag]*(SPR)/Ag3VO4/[Ag]*(SPR) → e–/Ag + h+/Ag e–/Ag + h+/VB/Ag3VO4 → hν or heat h+/Ag(as electronic channel) + e–/CB/WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ → hν or heat h+/Ag(as cocatalyst) + e–/CB/Ag3VO4 → hν or heat H+ + e–/Ag(as cocatalyst) → (1/2) H2 Organic pollutants + h+/VB/WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ → D+ → → D++ → → → CO2 + H2O + inorganic ions H2O + h+/VB/WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ → OH + H+ Organic pollutants + OH → D+ → → D++ → → → CO2 + H2O + inorganic ions"
14,Conclusions,"In conclusion, a novel Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst was successfully fabricated by hydrothermal and high temperature calcination methods. The prepared Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst displays a preeminent photocatalytic performance in degradation of LEV with synchronous hydrogen production. Under the conditions of 50 mg/L LEV solution as sacrificial agent and 180 min sunlight irradiation time the highest hydrogen amount (489.02 μmol) was acquired, which was greatly higher than those of the single component photocatalysts (WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ and Ag3VO4). In addition, the degradation ratio of LEV can reach to 90.44 % under the same conditions. The enhanced photocatalytic performance is closely related to the successful construction of Z-scheme photocatalytic system. And also, the WO3 can not only act as a photocatalyst, but also as the substrate of the up-conversion fluorescence agent to further boost the photocatalytic activity. The emitted ultraviolet and visible lights by WO3:Yb3+,Er3+ can activate the WO3 and induce the surface plasma resonance (SPR) effect of Ag NPs, respectively. The Ag NPs with SPR effect is used as electric channel and cocatalyst to accelerate the transfer of electrons. Besides, the Z-scheme WO3:Yb3+,Er3+/Ag/Ag3VO4/Ag photocatalyst also displays excellent sustainability and reusability in photocatalytic reaction. Perhaps, the present work might provide a novel strategy to develop high-effective photocatalysts for degradation of organic pollutants with synchronous hydrogen production."
