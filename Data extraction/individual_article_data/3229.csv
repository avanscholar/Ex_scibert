0,Introduction,"In recent decades, environmental problems have been at the heart of societal concerns and have been in the headlines. The opportunities have unfortunately become multiple and air pollution is emerging as a topical issue that increasingly affects citizens. Indeed, since the beginning of the industrial era, 200 to 250 years ago, human societies have significantly disturbed the atmosphere composition and the climate over a much shorter period of time. To cope with this ever-increasing pollution, catalytic processes allowing the degradation, reduction or elimination of pollutants are in full expansion. Our approach subscribes into this context. The challenge of this study is to find a clean alternative production of adipic aci, thus, we propose to develop a catalytic process for adipic acid production at 0% N2O, based on the concept of sustainable development and the principles of green chemistry. Adipic acid is a dicarboxylic acid which is of considerable importance in industry. It is mainly used as an intermediate in the production of nylon 6,6 (polyester, plastic, etc.). It is also used in the food industry and in cosmetics. Indeed, the industrial process for adipic acid production based on the oxidation of cyclohexanol-cyclohexanone mixture by nitric acid (50–60%) leads to the emission of phenomenal quantities of nitrous oxide N2O in the atmosphere (300 Kg of N2O per tonne of AA) [1–3]. With a residence time of 150 years in the troposphere, Nitrous oxide, that is a powerful greenhouse gas is considered to be one of the major destroyers of the ozone layer [4,5]. To circumvent these environmental constraints, several studies have focused on the use of benign oxidants such as O2, air and H2O2. This latter is easier to handle and its reduction only leads to the formation of water [6,7]. In contrast, the use of hydrogen peroxide in the liquid phase requires an acidic medium which generally comes from organic or mineral acids. However, these acids are a new source of pollution due to the phenomena of corrosion and toxicity. The use of polyoxometallates today appears as a promising way in this field. POMs, in addition to being low-polluting, non-toxic, and easy to prepare, they are known for their various properties in terms of structure, composition and functionality. Hence, a wide range of application fields as olefins epoxidation reactions [8], organosilanes oxidation [9], organic pollutants photo oxidative degradation [10], alcohols oxidation [11], cyclohexane [12] and cyclohexanol / cyclohexanone oxidation [13]. Thus, the acidity necessary for H2O2 reduction of and the oxidizing property necessary for the substrate oxidation could come only from POM. In this study, a series of mixed POMs of formula, H1.5-2xCo0.75VOxPMo12O40 (x = 0–0.75) was synthesized and characterized by SEM / EDX analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and UV–Visible spectroscopies, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Their catalytic activity was examined through cyclohexanone oxidation to AA with 30% of H2O2 in free solvent conditions. The effects of the POM composition and the reaction conditions were examined."
1,POMs preparation,"The Co0.75VOx mixed salts were synthesized by two-step cationic exchange method [13]. The first step consists to exchange the H3PMo12O40 protons by Ba2+ ions in stoichiometric ratios (x = 0–0.75) according to equation (1). In the second step, the Co2+ and VO2+ ions replace those of Ba2+ according to equation (2). The salts were recovered as a powder after drying at 50° C.

2,Characterization of solids,"The chemical composition of heteropolysals was determined by SEM / EDX analysis. The stochiometric coefficients were calculated on the basis of 12 Mo atoms per Keggin unit. The phosphorus number per Keggin unit in all solids and Co and VO atoms number per mole of salt are in good agreement with theoretical values. A very good correlation was observed between the experimental formulas, deduced from the SEM / EDX analysis and the theoretical one (Table 1 ). These results confirm the reliability of the synthesis method used in this work. In agreement with the data of Rocchiccioli-Deltcheff et al [14]. The FTIR spectra of salts (Fig. 1 ) show the presence of vibration bands characteristic of the Keggin anion structure. The bands located at (1062–1056) cm−1 correspond to the pure vibration mode ν(P–Oa), the bands situated at (959–953), (890–871) and (789–760) cm−1 are attributed to the metal–oxygen vibrations, ν(M = Od), ν(M−Ob−M) et ν(M−Oc−M), respectively. A shoulder of the Mo = Od vibration band (band characteristic of the Keggin anion symmetry) is observed around to 973 cm−1. These results suggest a probable passage of the Co2+ ion from the cationic position to the anionic one of the heteropolyanion considering that the Co2 + radius (r = 65 pm) is close to that of Mo6 + (r = 59 pm). It is known that Keggin type POMs exhibit a wide absorption band characteristic of Mo-O charge transfers in the near UV–visible [15]. Indeed this band was observed on all of the mixed Co-VO systems (Fig. 2 ). It is in the form of two components of different intensities, the first of great intensity was observed around 260 nm and the second of less intensity around 330 nm allowed respectively to Mo-Ot and Mo-Ob / Oc charge transfers [5]. The diffractograms of mixed salts Co0.75VOx (Fig. 3 ) are similar to that of H3PMo12O40 acid which crystallizes in a triclinic system [16]. Therefore, the substitution of protons by cobalt-vanadyl ions does not change the crystal lattice."
3,Catalytic test,"The experimental method adopted is based on that described in the literature [17]. A quantity of substrate (-one) and a mass of catalyst are introduced into a flask equipped with a condenser, everything is stirred. The reaction principle consists to oxidize the substrate to AA by the catalyst. The reduction of the catalyst is manifested by the passage of Mo (VI) of yellow color to Mo (V) of blue color (color characteristic of reduced POMs). The reduced POM is then oxidized by H2O2 which in its turn is reduced to water. The end of the reaction corresponds to the disappearance of the solution blueing. The mixture is then put in the refrigerator at about 4 °C overnight to recover the white AA crystals."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Effect of POM compositiom,"5.1 Effect of POM compositiom The results of Table 2 show that among the mixed salts, the combination Co0,75VO0,25 gives the best AA yield (28%). The higher activity of Co0,75VO0,25 compared to that of H3PMo12O40 could be explained by the counter ion position of [VO]2+ in the POM which would act as a free ion, capable to oxidize the ions of Co (II) to Co (III). The presence of all these ions in oxidized form and in reduced form could lead to a sequence of redox reactions such as: [VO]2+ + 2Co(II) → [V(H2O)6]2+ + 2Co(III), [V(H2O)6]2+ + 3Mo(VI) → 3Mo(V) + [VO2]+, [VO]2+ + Mo(VI) → Mo(V) + [VO2]+ and Cyclohexanone + POMox → produits + POMred.. It is difficult to predict which would be the catalytic species that involved in the substrate oxidation and the hydrogen peroxide.reduction. Conditions: Treact : 90 °C, Agitation rate: rigorous, mcat: 0.03 g, n-one : 30 mmol, H2O2: 30% t = 20 h."
6,Effect of solvent nature,"5.2 Effect of solvent nature The Fig. 4 shows that the AA yield is very sensitive to the solvent nature. The best yields of 28% are obtained either in the absence of the solvent or in the presence of CH3CN. On the other hand, in the presence of water or acetic acid, the AA yield falls brutally, it is of 12% and 0% respectively. The objective of our study is aiming for a clean AA synthesis, so the absence of solvent remains better."
7,"Effect of substrate amount for different quantities masses of Co0.75VO0.25 (0.03, 0.06 and 0.12 g)","5.3 Effect of substrate amount for different quantities masses of Co0.75VO0.25 (0.03, 0.06 and 0.12 g) The results of Fig. 5 show a parallel between the substrate amount and the catalyst mass. For important catalyst mass, a considerable substrate amount is necessary to achieve good AA yields, it is the same for low catalyst masses which require little substrate amounts. The maximum yield obtained is of the order of 32% for 0.06 g of catalyst and 30 mmol of substrate."
8,Effect of reaction time,"5.4 Effect of reaction time Figure 6 show that under our operating conditions and in the presence of the Co0.75VO0.25 catalytic system, 10 h of reaction is sufficient time to reach the maximum AA yield (31%) on the one hand. On the other hand, the AA formed after the 10 h reaction remains stable over time without any previous decomposition (31% at 10 h, 32% at 20 h and 33% at 25 h). These results are not in agreement with those already obtained in the literature [13] for which the optimal reaction time obtained for better AA yields was 20 h. Reaction time (h)"
9,Conclusion,"In this study, a series of Keggin-type POMs of formula H1.5-2xCo0.75VOxPMo12O40 was prepared, characterized by SEM/EDX, FT-IR, UV–Visbile and DRX and tested in homogeneous oxidation reaction of cyclohexanone in the presence of H2O2 as oxidant. The Co0.75V0.25PMo12O40 was found to be the better catalytic system toward AA production from cyclohexanone oxidation, with 31% of AA yield after 10 h of reaction time. This study can be a good economic and ecological alternative for adipic acid synthesis in the presence of Keggin type POMs Co0.75VOx, non-toxic, non-polluting and non-corrosive catalysts compared to nitric acid with hydrogen peroxide as oxidant agent which only leads to water as a by-product."
