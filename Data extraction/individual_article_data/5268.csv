0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered to be the energy carrier of the future. As storage and transportation of hydrogen pose certain technological and economic challenges, the use of liquid bio-fuels, such as ethanol and methanol, as hydrogen carriers is an attractive option [1]. Production of hydrogen from ethanol, for example, takes place via catalytic steam reforming: (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 6 H 2 The distribution of reaction products is influenced by the thermodynamic equilibrium of the following two reactions: (2) CO 2 + H 2 ↔ CO + H 2 O (3) CO + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + H 2 O Although reaction (1) is feasible thermodynamically at low temperatures, high temperatures (∼700–800 °C) are required for typical reforming catalysts to avoid excessive CH4 formation and byproducts, such as acetaldehyde and ethylene. Noble-metal and Ni catalysts favour kinetically the production of methane and, as a consequence, they provide high hydrogen yields only at high temperatures. On the other hand, use of high temperatures favours CO production (reaction (2)), so that additional water–gas shift reactors are required downstream to shift the products from CO to CO2 and H2. The large temperature gradients among the reactors make their heat management difficult and do not allow for high efficiencies, especially in small scale systems. Reforming of methanol, on the other hand, can proceed at lower temperatures than those of ethanol typically over copper-based catalysts, which offer high activity and selectivity to CO2 [2]. Other non-noble metals, such as cobalt, have been barely studied in methanol decomposition or reforming [3–6] although they have been studied quite extensively in ethanol reforming with promising results [7–12]. The present work refers to the investigation of cobalt–manganese catalysts prepared through pyrolysis of the corresponding fumarate or gluconate salts, in the reactions of methanol and ethanol reforming. Our reasoning behind the selection of the particular catalytic system is: (i) copper–manganese spinel oxide catalysts have been found to be efficient methanol reforming catalysts [13], so it would be of interest to examine the effect of replacement of copper with cobalt on catalytic properties, (ii) manganese oxides have been examined mainly as promoters of supported cobalt catalysts in ethanol reforming and not as the support [14]. Our reasoning behind the selection of the particular preparation method is based on the fact that cobalt catalysts have to get reduced, either by prereduction with hydrogen or under the action of the reaction feed, to attain their active state in reforming of methanol or ethanol. Thus, the typical synthesis of cobalt catalysts involves two steps, namely calcination and reduction. On the contrary, pyrolysis of the aforementioned organic salts can lead to the reduced state of the catalyst in a single step due to the reductive action of gases (H2, CO) and carbon produced during pyrolysis. Oxidative treatment of metal fumarate salts has been reported in the literature for the synthesis of simple or mixed transition metal oxides via oxidative treatment of these salts [15,16]. On the other hand, pyrolysis of iron fumarate under inert atmosphere leads to the production of iron nanoparticles in a carbonaceous matrix [17] while pyrolytic treatment of iron or cobalt gluconate leads to the respective metal-carbon composites [18]. Materials obtained from the pyrolytic decomposition of mixed cobalt–manganese fumarate and gluconate salts, which is the subject of the present work, have not been studied previously especially in terms of their catalytic performance."
1,Materials and methods,"The precursor compounds for catalyst synthesis were mixed fumarate or gluconate salts of cobalt and manganese, which were prepared by mixing aqueous solutions of cobalt and manganese acetate with an aqueous solution of d-gluconic acid or an ethanolic solution of fumaric acid followed by drying at 120 °C. The Co/Mn atomic ratio was 1/9, 1/2 and 1/1. The corresponding catalysts were prepared by pyrolysis of the salts under inert gas flow in the temperature range of 500–700 °C. The pyrolysis procedure was as follows: heating at 5 °C min−1 to the target temperature in the range 500–700 °C, soak for 5 min and cooling down to room temperature. Samples were also prepared via oxidative treatment of the salts at 500 °C for comparison purposes. The decomposition of the fumarate and gluconate salts was examined by the gravimetric method using a conventional microbalance system (TG121, Cahn) under dynamic conditions in a quartz reactor with a continuous flow of helium. The catalyst sample (20–21 mg) was placed on a small quartz plate. The reactor was flushed with a stream of helium (75 cm3 min−1) and the samples were heated up to 600 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The decomposition of the precursor salts was also monitored with in-situ XRD in a suitable furnace, and additionally by measurement of the evolving gases with a mass spectrometer during temperature-programmed pyrolysis. Characterization of the resulting materials was done with XRD (Bruker D8 Advance) and nitrogen physisorption (Autosorb-1, Quantachrome). These measurements were done over passivated samples obtained from controlled exposure of freshly prepared samples to oxygen-containing atmosphere at 50 °C. More specifically, the samples were kept overnight under a 1% O2 gaseous flow before being exposed to the atmosphere. In this way, oxygen uptake by the samples takes place at a slow rate and the accompanying temperature increase is at most 1–2 °C. The oxygen uptake is due to chemisorption on carbon and cobalt leading to surface oxidation of cobalt crystallites. This was found necessary since samples prepared via pyrolysis exhibit pyrophoric behaviour. It should be noted that the XRD patterns of passivated samples are identical to those of non-passivated ones (obtained by in-situ XRD). Catalytic experiments in methanol and ethanol steam reforming were performed in fixed-bed quartz reactors under atmospheric pressure. The reactor was loaded with 0.204 g of fumarate salt or 0.220 g of gluconate salt diluted with sand in 1/5 ratio. The catalyst was prepared in-situ through pyrolysis of the salt (at 500–700 °C) right before the catalytic test. In the case of methanol, the reaction feed consisted of 5% methanol and 7.5% H2O (S/C ratio of 1.5) with total flow rate of 100 cm3 min−1 (balance gas was helium). Measurements were made with increasing and then decreasing temperature sequence. In the case of ethanol reforming, catalyst precursors were heated in a stream of helium with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 up to 600 °C. Then catalysts were cooled down to 350 °C, i.e. to the lowest temperature of the reaction measurements. The amounts of catalysts, after precursor decomposition, were equal to 0.1 g. The catalyst was diluted (at the weight ratio of 1/10) with 0.15–0.3 mm quartz grains. The aqueous solution of ethanol (10.85 wt.%, EtOH/water molar ratio = 1/21), simulating a fermentation broth, was supplied by a mass controller (Bronkhorst) to an evaporator (150 °C) and the reactant vapours without dilution with any inert gas were fed to the reactor at a flow rate of 0.268 mol h−1 (100 cm3 min−1). The reaction temperature, measured in the centre of the bed, was changed from 350 to 600 °C. The temperature was increased stepwise with 2 h soaking at each temperature."
2,Results,
3,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The decomposition of Co–Mn gluconate salts was studied gravimetrically and the results are shown in Fig. 1 . It can be observed that the decomposition starts at around 200 °C and continues all the way up to 600 °C. The abrupt weight loss at ∼200 °C is accompanied by production of H2O and CO2 and leads also to swelling and foaming of the material as part of the produced gases get trapped inside the solid phase. Pyrolysis of the salt leaves residual carbon along with the Co–Mn phases. The residual carbon contains also H and O heteroatoms, which decrease continuously with increase of the pyrolysis temperature. It is also evident that variation of the cobalt content does not influence the decomposition behaviour of the respective salt. The corresponding results regarding the decomposition of Co–Mn fumarate salts are given in Fig. 2 . It can be observed that fumarate salts are considerably more stable than the gluconate ones and their decomposition starts above 400 °C and takes place essentially in a single step at 430–450 °C. The sample containing the highest quantity of cobalt appears to decompose at a slightly lower temperature. Randhawa and Kaur [19] studied the decomposition of cobalt and manganese fumarate under air by TG-DTG-DTA and reported that oxidative decomposition of manganese fumarate takes place at ∼400 °C towards MnO, while that of cobalt fumarate at ∼350 °C towards CoO. It is evident that decomposition of the salts takes place at lower temperature under air than under inert gas. The observed weight losses are smaller than in the case of gluconates, since the relative amount of the organic to the inorganic phase is smaller in the case of fumarates. The gases evolving during the pyrolysis of fumarate salts were monitored by mass spectrometry and the results pertaining to the Co/Mn (1/1) fumarate salt heated with 5 °C min−1 up to 550 °C are presented in Fig. 3 . It can be observed that only water appears at temperatures below 300 °C (due to desorption of adsorbed water) and evolution of gases starts above 400 °C in accordance to the gravimetric results. The decomposition of fumarate groups takes place in a narrow temperature range (400–470 °C) with the production of CO, CO2, H2O and H2. In-situ XRD was employed to identify the type of crystalline phases forming during pyrolysis of the precursor salts. The XRD patterns obtained during pyrolysis of the fumarate salt with Co/Mn (1/1) are given in Fig. 4 . The crystalline phase of the fumarate salt is stable up to 400 °C, as indicated by the similar XRD patterns at 25 °C (before heating) and at 400 °C. The fumarate salt decomposes between 400 and 500 °C and reflections corresponding to MnO (JCPDS 01-075-1090) and metallic Co (JCPDS 00-0152-0806) phases appear at 550 °C, which become more intense with further increase in temperature. Obviously, the presence of residual carbon leads to reduction of Co2+ ions towards metallic cobalt via a carbothermal reaction and the reduced form of the catalyst is obtained in a single step during the decomposition of the precursor salt. XRD measurements carried out for the passivated samples obtained from fumarate salts showed also the presence of nanocrystalline metallic cobalt and MnO phases. The specific surface area of all samples was in the range of 200–220 m2 g−1 regardless of the pyrolysis temperature. This implies that the materials prepared in the temperature range of 550–700 °C maintain a more or less stable porous structure due to the presence of residual carbon in the materials after pyrolysis, which in addition hinders extensive sintering of Co and MnO crystallites. The corresponding results regarding in-situ XRD during pyrolysis of the gluconate salt (Co/Mn = 1/1) are presented in Fig. 5 . The crystalline gluconate phase is present up to 200 °C, but it disappears above this temperature, in accordance to TGA results (Fig. 1). The XRD patterns indicate the absence of crystalline phases up to 600 °C, while the phases of MnO and metallic cobalt appear at 650 °C. Thus, pyrolysis of both gluconate and fumarate salts leads to formation of reduced catalyst phases, i.e. Co–MnO, which takes place at lower temperature in the case of fumarate salts."
4,Methanol reforming,"3.2 Methanol reforming Catalytic measurements in methanol reforming were obtained in increasing temperature sequence followed by a decreasing sequence. Fig. 6 shows the conversion of methanol for catalysts with varying Co/Mn ratio prepared from pyrolysis of fumarate salts at 550 °C. Increase in cobalt loading leads to increase of catalytic activity. Similar results were obtained for catalysts prepared via pyrolysis at higher temperatures (600–700 °C), although differences in activity were not as significant as those after pyrolysis at 550 °C. Overall, complete conversion of methanol is obtained at 375–400 °C. It should be also mentioned that the hysteresis between the ascending and descending temperature sequence is very small, suggesting a stable catalytic performance and a stable oxidation state of the catalyst surface. The corresponding selectivity to CO2 of the experiments in Fig. 6 is shown in Fig. 7 . The dashed line indicates the predicted selectivity under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium of the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction. All catalysts achieve equilibrium concentrations of CO2 only at high reaction temperatures, while the catalyst with the highest cobalt loading shows the highest CO2 selectivity at any temperature. The main carbon-containing products of methanol reforming were CO2 and CO. Methane was also produced at high reaction temperatures with selectivity of the order of 1–2%. The effect of pyrolysis temperature on catalyst activity at the descending temperature sequence is depicted in Fig. 8 for the catalysts with a Co/Mn ratio of 1/1. The data for the precalcined catalyst are also included for comparison purposes. The pyrolysis temperature does not have an important effect on catalyst activity, while the precalcined catalyst is evidently less active than all pyrolyzed samples. The lower activity of the precalcined sample is accompanied by a lower selectivity towards CO2. Catalysts were also prepared from gluconate salts and it was found that the most active catalyst is the one with a Co/Mn ratio equal to 1/1, as in the case of catalysts prepared from fumarate salts. The effect of pyrolysis temperature on methanol conversion over the Co/Mn (1/1) catalysts prepared from gluconates is presented in Fig. 9 . It can be observed that the activity drops with increase of pyrolysis temperature and the most active catalyst is the one prepared at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C. On the other hand, the catalyst prepared by calcination of the gluconate salt is considerably less active. Comparison of the performance of catalysts tested in this work with literature results is not straightforward because of: (i) the scarcity of available data regarding methanol reforming over cobalt-based catalysts and (ii) the different conditions of the catalytic measurements. Segal et al. [5] have studied methanol reforming over Co/Al catalysts derived from layered double hydroxide precursors. Catalytic tests were performed with an undiluted 1/1 MeOH/H2O feed over 0.150 g of unreduced catalyst. Methanol conversion did not exceed 10% at 400 °C. Manova et al. [4] studied methanol decomposition over Fe–Co spinel oxides employing a feed with 1.57% methanol and a WHSV of 1.5 h−1. The most active catalyst was the one with a Co/Fe ratio of 2/1, whereas complete decomposition of methanol was observed at ∼280–300 °C."
5,Ethanol reforming,"3.3 Ethanol reforming Analogous activity tests were carried out in the case of ethanol reforming. The ethanol and water conversion obtained over the catalysts prepared from fumarate salts at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C are shown in Fig. 10 (a). It can be observed that the activity increases with increase of cobalt loading as in the case of methanol reforming and complete conversion of ethanol is obtained at 420 °C. It should be recalled that water is in great excess in the feed (21/1 ratio), hence its maximum conversion does not exceed the value of ∼15%. The corresponding selectivity to CO2 for the experiments in Fig. 10(a) is shown in Fig. 10(b). The selectivity to CO2 is maximized at 420 °C. Further increase of temperature leads to decrease of CO2 selectivity in favour of CO, as predicted thermodynamically. Overall, the main carbon-containing product at a temperature of at least 420 °C was CO2 followed by CO and CH4. In the case of the Co/Mn (1/1) catalyst, other by-products were only observed at the reaction temperature of 350 °C and these were mainly acetaldehyde (selectivity ∼12%) and acetone (selectivity ∼1%). Catalytic performance in ethanol reforming was also evaluated in the case of catalysts prepared from gluconate salts via pyrolysis at 600 °C. The ethanol and water conversion obtained over the catalysts prepared from gluconate salts at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C is shown in Fig. 11 (a). It can be observed that the activity increases with increase of cobalt loading as also shown in previous paragraphs and complete conversion of ethanol is obtained at 480 °C. It is obvious that catalysts derived from gluconate precursors are less active than the ones derived from fumarates (Fig. 10). The corresponding selectivity to CO2 for the experiments in Fig. 11(a) is shown in Fig. 11(b). The selectivity to CO2 increases with temperature in contrast to what was found for catalysts from fumarate salts. Due to the lower activity of these catalysts, undesired by-products, such as acetaldehyde, are present in the reactor exit even at a reaction temperature of 480 °C and yield to hydrogen is maximized at a reaction temperature of 540 °C, being in any case lower than the hydrogen yield obtained over catalysts prepared from fumarate salts already at 420 °C. Although ethanol reforming over cobalt catalysts has been frequently studied, there are no reports concerning Co/MnO catalysts. The closest example is the one of Co/ZnO catalysts promoted with Mn (with Mn/Co ratio up to 0.35) studied by Casanovas et al. [14]. Catalytic tests were performed over pre-reduced samples with a 6/1 H2O/EtOH ratio. Complete conversion of ethanol was observed above 400 °C with CO2, CO and CH4 being the carbon-containing products. Acetaldehyde was found only at temperatures below 400 °C."
6,Discussion,"Catalytic tests in ethanol reforming were carried out with a feed containing a large excess of water (H2O/EtOH = 21/1). This specific water/ethanol ratio corresponds to the ethanol content of a fermentation broth, so, in principle, one could use directly this broth as a feed in the reformer. Additionally, a high water/ethanol ratio helps in avoiding extensive coking under reaction conditions. Experiments with lower water/ethanol ratios and optimized catalysts are currently in progress to evaluate catalyst performance with more demanding feeds. The reaction experiments in methanol and ethanol reforming presented in this work were done with a feed containing 5% of the alcohol at a total flow rate of 100 cm3 min−1 and, therefore, they could be considered directly comparable. The catalysts with the highest cobalt loading (Co/Mn 1/1) were found to be the most active both in methanol and ethanol reforming. Since methanol is a simpler molecule than ethanol, its conversion takes place at lower temperatures than ethanol. In the case of catalysts derived from fumarates complete conversion of methanol is obtained at 375–400 °C and complete conversion of ethanol at 420 °C. In the case of catalysts derived from gluconates via pyrolysis at 600 °C, complete conversion of methanol is obtained at 400–425 °C and complete conversion of ethanol at 480 °C. There is considerable difference in the selectivity to CO2 between methanol and ethanol reforming, but this is easily explained by the different water content in the two feeds, as the higher water content in the feed of ethanol reforming drives the equilibrium towards the CO2 side. The results obtained so far indicate that the examined catalysts are able to reform both ethanol and methanol under comparable reaction conditions. These could be classified as low temperature ethanol reforming (compared to other noble-metal catalysts), but high temperature methanol reforming (compared to copper catalysts [1]). Methanol reforming over the examined cobalt catalysts appears to take place through a methanol decomposition step followed by the water–gas shift reaction, since the CO2 concentration is always equal or lower than equilibrium. The proposed method of catalyst preparation via pyrolysis of organic carboxylate salts leads in a single step to the reduced active state of the catalysts. The final structure contains also a residual carbon matrix, which helps avoiding excessive particle growth and sintering during synthesis and also under reaction conditions. The carbon content depends on the structure of the parent organic group employed as precursor."
7,Conclusions,Pyrolysis of mixed organic carboxylate salts is a new method for direct synthesis of cobalt-based catalysts in reduced form and with favourable structural features. These catalysts are more active than those prepared under oxidative pre-treatment in the reactions of steam reforming of ethanol and methanol. Reforming of both alcohols takes place under comparable conditions at temperatures in the range of 400–450 °C.
