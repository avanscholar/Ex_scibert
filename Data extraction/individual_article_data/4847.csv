1,Substrate and inoculum,"1.1 Substrate and inoculum KW was collected from the cafeteria of the research area “Roma 1” of the National Research Council. The cafeteria produces approximately 400 kg of KW per week, which consisted of mixed cooked and uncooked food such as pasta, rice, soup, bread, fruit and vegetable peelings. After sampling, the KW underwent an accurate manual screening to match the quantities of the various fractions with the chosen composition: 70% Fruit and vegetable waste, 15% pasta and bread and 15% dairy residues. Successively, sorted scraps were shredded by a food processor, prior to being stored at −20°C. Before AD tests, KW was thawed and diluted 1:5 by weight with tap water. The anaerobic inocula for mesophilic and thermophilic tests were extracted from two full-scale anaerobic digesters, operated at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. Inoculum was degassed for several days until no significant methane production was observed, to deplete the residual biodegradable organic matter (Angelidaki et al., 2009). The average characteristics of the degassed inoculum were: pH = 7.5 ± 0.1; TS = 25 ± 4 g TS/kg; VS = 19 ± 3 g VS/kg and CODtot = 19.4 ± 1.8 g COD/kg for the mesophilic one; pH = 7.8 ± 0.1; TS = 23 ± 3 g TS/kg; VS = 12 ± 2 g VS/kg; CODtot = 16.4 ± 2.3 g COD/kg for the thermophilic one."
2,Thermal pretreatment,"1.2 Thermal pretreatment The frozen KW sample was thawed and mixed with tap water at a weight ratio 1:5 to maximize the effectiveness of pretreatment, which was carried out in a bench scale autoclave Laboklav 25b, with total capacity of 25 L (SHP Steriltechnik AG, Germany). Operative temperature and pressure were set at 134°C and 320,000 Pa, respectively. Retention time was set at 20 min on 300 mL of sample. The applied specific thermal energy resulted around 505 kJ/kg KW. The pretreatment efficacy was expressed by means of the degree of parameters changed availability (soluble COD, proteins, carbohydrates, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, starch), according to the Eq. (1): (1) X availability = X after pretreatment − X before pretreatment X before pretreatment In the case of negative value, the absolute value was taken as the grade of transformation of the initial compound in other forms."
3,Biomethane potential assays: experimental set-up and procedures,"1.3 Biomethane potential assays: experimental set-up and procedures Biomethane Potential (BMP) tests for determining the anaerobic biodegradability in terms of hydrogen and methane yields were carried out by using the Automatic Methane Potential Test System (AMPTS-II, Bioprocess Control, Sweden) with AMPTS 2.1 (v1.150) software. AMPTS-II consisted of 15 parallel and identical batch reactors of 500 mL capacity (Fig. 1 A), filled up to 300 mL of working volume. Each reactor was mechanically stirred (mixing time: 90 sec on/120 sec off, speed adjustment: 86%). The CO2-fixing unit vials were filled with 80 mL of 3 mol/L NaOH each (Fig. 1B), thus allowing the absorption of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Gas production rates were measured online by volumetric cells (Fig. 1C) equipped with automated data logging system (Fig. 1e). Hydrogen and methane contents were analysed by gas chromatography (Fig. 1d) every 2 hr at the beginning of the tests (i.e., after 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 20, 22 hr, etc.), in order to follow the H2 and CH4 production pathways. Each reactor bottle was partially filled with inoculum and substrate, according to a substrate/inoculum (S/I) ratio of 0.5 or 1, on a VS basis. In addition, every S/I ratio was tested at both mesophilic (37°C) and thermophilic (55°C) scenarios (Table 1 ). Reactors were flushed with N2 gas before sealing in order to create an anaerobic ambient in all batch headspaces. Blank tests were performed for each set of BMP tests so that the biogas production attributable to the residual organic matter contained in the inoculum could be accounted for. In order to follow the changes in the KW composition throughout the digestion, each test was started in 4 identical replicates and then at regular time intervals (1, 2 and 6 days) one reactor was stopped and analyses were performed. The reactors were stopped when the daily methane production was <0.5% of the total one over 1-week period. During mesophilic trial at S/I = 1, after 6 days pH correction from 5.3 up to 7.0 was performed with the addition of Na2CO3 to facilitate methanogenesis. All tests were performed in duplicates. The COD mass balance for all the batches was computed considering the initial and final COD data, and the equivalent COD of methane and hydrogen (0.350 L CH4/gCOD and 1.402 L H2/gCOD at standard conditions, T = 0°C and P = 101,325 Pa) which indicated a closure at 95%–98%, thus emphasizing data reliability."
4,Theoretical methane and hydrogen potential,"1.4 Theoretical methane and hydrogen potential The theoretical methane potential (BMPth) is widely used to estimate the methane production of a given organic substrate. BMPth was calculated and used as “touchstone” to evaluate the anaerobic biodegradability. The individual components of cellulose and hemicellulose can be degraded to some extent in anaerobic conditions, whereas lignin is non-degradable. However, when the other components are tightly bound to lignin they become inaccessible for microorganisms and thereby non-degradable. The theoretical CH4 production of each major component in the VS fraction was calculated using the stoichiometric equation (Symons and Buswell, 1933). BMPth and anaerobic biodegradability were calculated using the following Eq. (2): (2) BMP th = 0.415 ⋅ L STP g carbohydrates + 0.496 ⋅ L STP g proteins + 1.014 ⋅ L STP g lipids + 0.727 ⋅ L STP g lignin where BMPth is expressed in LCH4/g VS and C57H104O6, C5H7O2N, C6H10O5, and C10H13O3 are the empirical formulas for lipid, protein, carbohydrate and lignin, respectively (Angelidaki and Sanders, 2004; Maya-Altamira et al., 2008; Triolo et al., 2011). On the other hand, the BHPth (BioHydrogen Potential) was calculated as in Pagliaccia et al. (2019), referring the observed hydrogen production to that corresponding to the catabolic fermentation of the soluble sugars via the acetate pathway, disregarding the anabolism (Reaction (3)): (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 Such assumption is corroborated by the simultaneous absence of methane production during the first 48 hr of the test (when H2 production was accomplished) and the lack of carbohydrates in the reactors after the same period. Therefore, all available soluble sugars were promptly fermented and no hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis took place, as also observed also in Pagliaccia et al. (2019). The maximum theoretical stoichiometric production for the equation above corresponds to 4 mol of hydrogen per 1 mol of glucose consumed, that is, in terms of COD, a theoretical maximum yield of 1.402 L H2/g CODremoved as glucose at standard conditions. Values of BMPth calculated from KW composition were compared to the experimental ones, following the ensuing Eqs. (4) and (5): (4) Prompt sugars fermentability % = F = BHP exp BHP th ⋅ X (5) Biodegradability % = BMP exp BMP th ⋅ 100 − F where BHPexp and BMPexp are the experimental values obtained, X is the fraction of soluble sugars in the KW (expressed as VS) and F is the fraction of soluble sugars converted to hydrogen during the fermentation stage."
5,Analytical methods,"1.5 Analytical methods Total and volatile solids were determined according to standard methods. The pH was detected by a portable pH meter Eutech Instruments pH 700. Soluble (sCOD) and total COD, measured in duplicates, were determined by means of COD Cell Test of Spectroquant Merck (EPA method 410.4). Total nitrogen was determined photometrically after transformation of organic and inorganic nitrogen compounds into nitrate according to Koroleff's method by treatment with an oxidizing agent in a thermoreactor (T = 120°C for 1 hr) and after reaction with 2.6-dimethylphenol (DMP) to form 4-nitro-2.6-dimethylphenol in a solution acidified with sulfuric and phosphoric acid. Nitrogen (total) cell tests by Spectroquant Merck (digestion analogous to EN ISO 11905-1 and determination of nitrate analogous to DIN 38405-9) were used. Ammonium nitrogen (NH4 +-N) was determined according to APHA (1998). Colloidal proteins and carbohydrates were measured on filtered liquid samples (glass filters GF/C Whatman, 1.2 μm porosity); protein content was determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, USA) using standard solution of bovine serum albumin, which was modified from Lowry method, while carbohydrates determination was based on a modified DuBois method. Total proteins content was estimated by multiplying the organic nitrogen content by a factor of 6.25. NREL method for “Determination of Structural Carbohydrates and Lignin in Biomass” was partially adapted (Di Bitonto et al., 2016) and applied on the different lyophilised food waste samples in order to evaluate the content and the composition of simple and structural complex sugars (Pagliaccia et al., 2019). The biogas composition was measured using a PerkinElmer Auto System Gas Chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
6,Analysis of data through kinetic models,"1.6 Analysis of data through kinetic models To determine the performance parameters it can be assumed that a first order hydrolysis model (Eq. (6)) represents the overall process: (6) d S d t = − K h ⋅ S where S is the substrate concentration and K h is the first order hydrolysis constant. This simplified model assumes that hydrolysis is the limiting step of the process; K h embodies the kinetic parameters representing all of the AD processes, such as hydrolysis, fermentation and methanogenesis accounted for in more sophisticated models, such as the ADM1 (Batstone et al., 2002). Once Eq. (6) is integrated, the relationship between substrate concentration and time can be represented by the Gompertz equation (7): (7) S = S 0 ( 1 − exp ( K h ⋅ t ) ) where S 0 is the ultimate methane potential. In the literature, several simplified models have been applied for estimating performance parameters. The modified Gompertz equation (MG) is considered appropriate to model both hydrogen and methane production, since it accounts for the lag phase that may take place at the beginning of the process (Eq. (8)): (8) S = S 0 exp { − exp [ R m ⋅ e S 0 ⋅ ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where λ is the lag phase extent and R m represents the biogas production rate. The three parameters in this model are restricted to specific experimental conditions and cannot be used in a predictive mode (Gadhamshetty et al., 2010). The Gompertz equation is the most common tool for determination of kinetics constants of a reaction (Kainthola et al., 2019). The logistic function (LF) is a sigmoid curve that finds application in a range of fields, including solid waste fermentation/methanation in landfills and biomethane potential tests (Donoso-Bravo et al., 2010; Deepanraj et al., 2017). This model properly fits the global cumulative biogas production shape, since it presents an initial exponential increase until it reaches a final stabilization at maximal production level (Eq. (9)). Moreover, it assumes that the rate of biogas production is proportional to the amount of gas already produced, the maximum production rate and the maximum capacity of biogas production (Donoso-Bravo et al., 2010). (9) S = S 0 1 + exp ( 4 ⋅ R m ( λ − t ) S 0 + 2 ) Eq. (10) shows the transference function (TF), which is a sigmoid curve used to mathematically fit inputs and outputs in black box models (reaction curve-type model). It is traditionally applied to assess the efficacy of conventional pretreatments (Li et al., 2013) and for control purposes, which considers that any process might be analysed as a system receiving inputs and generating outputs (Donoso-Bravo et al., 2010). This model predicts maximum gas production solely based on CH4 production (Redzwan and Banks, 2004): (10) S = S 0 ( 1 − exp R m ( λ − t ) S 0 ) In the current study, after obtaining cumulative biogas production curves over time from the anaerobic digestion batch tests, Gompertz equation (modified or not), logistic function and transference function were used to determine biogas production potential (S 0), maximum rate of biogas production (R m) and duration of the lag phase (λ). The unknown parameters of the above-mentioned models have been individuated through a standard procedure of nonlinear regression, which requires the minimization of a cost function. The least squares procedure has been selected as cost function (Eq. (11)): (11) J = 1 N ∑ j = 1 N ( t j ( obs ) − t j ( sim ) ) 2 where, J is the cost function to be minimized; N is the number of data; t j (obs) is the observed value at t j ; t j (sim) is the simulated value at t j . Coefficient of correlation (R 2 ) was also determined by considering the regression tool (Mu et al., 2007; Deepanraj et al., 2015) and used as a parameter for defining the best fit among the chosen models. Visual check of fitted predicted and measured value in addition to regression value was engaged into consideration to investigate the feasibility of the model. These procedures were applied to describe the thermal pretreatment effect on the substrate analysed."
7,Results and discussion,
8,KW characterization and effects of pretreatment,"2.1 KW characterization and effects of pretreatment Solids concentration of KW was found to be 190 ± 10 g/kg wet weight (ww), with high organic substance content (VS/TS = 94%), highlighting significant water content and high transformation potential of the substrate in AD process. CODtot was mapped in terms of proteins, carbohydrates, lignocellulosic components, lipids and VFA (Table 2 ). Lignin content was slightly higher (13% of TS) than the one found in literature (generally < 12% of TS) due to the high fraction of vegetable wastes of this KW (Romero-Cedillo et al., 2017). In Chinese vegetable crop residues, lignin contents ranged from 5.1% to 11.25%TS (Li et al., 2019). The high soluble carbohydrates content (21% CODtot) was probably due to high water content combined with the grinding phase that acts as physical pretreatment. Thermal pretreatment, due to the mild temperature and the low pressure, did not affect the solids and organic content; however, it resulted in a 57% increase in soluble COD, which regarded all of the macromolecular fractions. Soluble protein content was the most affected (+40%), followed by lipids (+29%) and lastly carbohydrates (+9%), since most carbohydrates were already in soluble form also in the raw feedstock due to the grinding phase. Ma et al. (2011) conducted a study on the effect of thermal pretreatment (120°C, 30 min) on chemical composition of KW. They reported that the pH remained unchanged but others parameters such as TS, VS, and soluble COD, increased by 5.4%, 4.5% and 24% respectively. Lignocellulosic fraction diminished by 9%, confirming again that autoclaving can undermine, at least in part, lignocellulosic structure (Heerah et al., 2008; Tampio et al., 2014; Pagliaccia et al., 2019). In fact, pretreatment changed somehow the interlinkages connecting cellulose (−6%), hemicellulose (−14%) and particularly lignin (−8%)."
9,Batch digestion tests: impact of different operating conditions,"2.2 Batch digestion tests: impact of different operating conditions S/I ratio and temperature regimen are critical operational parameters for methane production (Braguglia et al., 2018). This part of the study investigated the impact of S/I ratio on the methanogenic activity by selecting S/I = 0.5 and 1, and by changing the temperature of the AD process. The effect of these operative conditions on thermal pretreated KW was investigated, too. The selected operating conditions - low S/I ratio and the typology of the inoculum which was retrieved from a digester treating sewage sludge - were aimed at favouring methanogenic activity, rather than fermentation and H2 production. 2.2.1 Mesophilic tests: impact of S/I ratio and pretreatment The initial production of hydrogen (over the first 48 hr), suggested the low activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the anaerobic biomass used as inoculum (Fig. 2 ). Indeed, H2 production is ought to the kinetic imbalance between fermentation and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. At S/I = 0.5, the mesophilic digestion started promptly and resulted in the lowest H2 yields (Fig. 2a); under the same conditions the pretreatment achieved the best gain in H2 production, which was increased by 170% (Table 3 ). Rafieenia et al. (2017) obtained higher yields for H2 (apart for the protein-rich substrate) even at lower S/I ratio (S/I = 0.3). This was probably due to a higher concentration of solubilised organic matter in the form of carbohydrates or lipids. Final methane yields at S/I = 0.5 for untreated and pretreated KW where statistically not different (378 ± 0.014 and 370 ± 0.008 mL CH4/g VSfed, respectively), but lower than the value of 648 mL CH4/g VSfed reported by Ariunbaatar et al. (2014) for thermally pretreated KW, unveiling a more biodegradable and lipid richer substrate. Studies on autoclaved reconstructed OFMSW in mesophilic conditions and similar S/I ratio (0.67) did not show significant BMP increase, despite the high solubilisation rate (Pecorini et al., 2016). Tampio et al. (2014) reported a 7.9%–11.7% decrease in methane yields with thermal pretreatment at T > 160°C, despite the high solubilisation degree observed. Thermal pretreatments for H2 production gave a 92-fold upgrade in hydrogen production by pure culture even without pH control. These outcomes suggest that the released soluble COD can be initially converted into hydrogen instead of methane, if the operating conditions (as hydrogenotrophic methanogens activity, pH, temperature, and S/I ratio) are favourable. In fact, sCOD increased during the first 48 hr in the untreated sample, along the hydrolytic phase; on the other hand, sCOD was instantaneously consumed in the pretreated one, which had already undergone hydrolysis over the pretreatment step. At the end of the digestion the sCOD at S/I = 0.5 was around 0.3 g COD/L for both untreated and pretreated samples, suggesting that the solubilized biodegradable fraction was completely converted into biohydrogen or biomethane. By increasing the S/I ratio to 1, despite the prompt digestion activation, biogas production stopped after one day for both untreated and pretreated samples due to pH drop (5.5 for the untreated vs. 5.6 for the pretreated) and VFAs concentration over 7 g COD/L (Appendix A Table S1). Moreover, hydrogen production was extremely high with over 300 mL produced in less than 24 hr. Analyses were repeated at day 2 (t = 48 hr) and day 6 (t = 144 hr) and confirmed the presence of pH inhibition due to organic overload, as indicated in Appendix A Table S1. The pH dropped to values lower than 5.5, VFAs peaked up to above 9 g COD/L and sCOD increased to over 10 g COD/L, meaning that after day 1 (when around 70% of the soluble carbohydrates were consumed for hydrogen production) all the sCOD was comprised of VFAs, mostly of which were butyrate. In general, low hydrogenase activity is related to pH lower than 5.2 (Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009). Different trends were observed during experiments conducted at lower S/I ratio. Over “M 1” digestion, sCOD kept growing until day 6 using with the pretreated sample and until day 14 (t = 336 hr) with the untreated one. The pH was buffered after 6 days (adding sodium carbonate), up to a value of 7.3 for both untreated and pretreated samples. Probably due to the inhibiting effects of VFAs accumulation, the recovery of methanogenesis activity was slow even after pH correction. Digestion lasted 71 days, almost the double of the “M 0.5” test, and ultimate sCOD concentrations were higher than usual even when biogas production ceased. Final sCOD were 2.5 and 7 g COD/L for “M 1 U” and “M 1 P” respectively (in “M 0.5” were around 0.3 g COD/L), whereas proteins were 1.5 g COD/L (compared to a value of 0.3 g COD/L). VFAs resulted around 1 and 5 g COD/L for “M 1 U” and “M 1 P” respectively (compared to values below 0.01 g COD/L), as reported in Appendix A Table S1. H2 yields were very high, and in the case of “M 1 P” corresponded to 75% of the maximum theoretical conversion of the available sugars. These hydrogen yields are in agreement with the highest values found in literature for two-stage digestion of FW (Braguglia et al., 2018). Despite the subtraction of the soluble COD not more available for methanogenesis, the “M 1 P” CH4 yield (398 mL CH4/g VSfed) was high. On the contrary, “M 1 U” reported a CH4 yield lower than “M 0.5”, deeply affected by the microorganisms' inhibition. This phenomenon was not observed in “M 1 P” since pretreatment eased the AD process. Indeed, soluble protein content for “M 1 U” was higher at the end of the entire process than at day 6, thus meaning that proteins had been solubilized but not fully degraded, as experienced also by Yasin et al. (2013). Pretreatment was effective in solubilising organic matter and this resulted in faster and greater recovery in “M 1 P” after buffering the system, since methanogens reactivated and converted the solubilised substrate and VFAs. 2.2.2 Thermophilic tests: impact of S/I ratio and pretreatment The operative conditions reported in Section 2.2.1 were also applied at thermophilic temperature of 55 ± 1°C, to assess the temperature effects. Hydrogen and methane specific production curves (mL/g VSfed) are reported in Fig. 3 . Pretreatment enhanced the H2 yield by 17% over “T 0.5 U” whereas CH4 yield was slightly lower (−8%). A higher S/I ratio (“T 1”) resulted in a slight increase of H2 yield, although lower than the ones found for “M 1”. As for “T 0.5”, operating temperature did not favour CH4 conversion in pretreated mixture. Despite the high S/I ratio, during “T 1” no inhibition due to VFA accumulation was experienced, and the digestion continued smoothly until organics consumption was over. Probably the enhanced kinetics allowed acid-consuming and acid-producing bacteria to work at the same pace, thus preventing pH inhibition. An increase in temperature, in fact, can increase enzyme activity and thermodynamic gain, reduce viscosity, and can accelerate the substrate utilisation (Voelklein et al., 2016). VFA accumulation at 48 hr was noticed also in this case (Appendix A Table S1), the prevailing VFA being acetate, whereas butyrate was the main by-product of acidogenesis during mesophilic trials. Soluble COD was maintained lower over all the digestion process (maximum value for “T 1 U” was 8 g COD/L, and for “T 1 P” was 6.5 g COD/L at 48 hr, mainly composed by acetate) and total digestion time was 48 days (t = 1152 hr). This clearly reflected in “T 1 U” CH4 yield, when non-stressed methanogens reported an increase of 7% over “M 1 U”. Rising temperature also caused a higher (almost doubled) concentration of ammonium nitrogen from a value of 0.5 gNH4 +-N/L for 37°C up to 0.9 gNH4 +-N/L at 55°C. Thermophilic systems are more susceptible to ammonia inhibition, due to a decrease in ammonia pKa, resulting in a higher concentration of free ammonia (Batstone and Jensen, 2011). 2.2.3 Anaerobic biodegradability The ability of the theoretical methodologies in estimating hydrogen and methane yields of complex substrates was evaluated by comparing the experimental batch productivity with the theoretical productivity (Eqs. (4) and (5)), providing fermentability and biodegradability calculation. Average hydrogen and methane yields and gains (pretreatment derived) as well as the extent of fermentability (from soluble sugars) and methane biodegradability of KW, untreated and thermal pretreated, are shown in Table 3. It is interesting to note that the fermentability, except for the low values obtained for M 0.5 test, was in the narrow range of 14%–23%, highlighting the significant portion of the VS rapidly transformed into hydrogen, due to suitable operating conditions, as inoculum microbial composition and initial pH value. The most important result due to KW pretreatment was the enhancement of H2 yield and initial fermentability: the high content of solubilized sugars due to pretreatment, noticeably improved the conversion into hydrogen (Alibardi and Cossu, 2016; Braguglia et al., 2018; Pagliaccia et al., 2019), in particular in mesophilic conditions. Thermophilic tests experienced a much lower enhancement, probably ought to the increased activity of fermentative bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Lay et al. (2003) found that biohydrogen production from carbohydrate-rich substrates is twenty times greater when compared to lipid and protein-rich substrates. Rafieenia et al. (2017) investigated 3 different types of FW, each with a macromolecular fraction (carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) largely prevailing over the others, finding out that the carbohydrates rich one had the highest H2 yield. With regard to solid waste, other studies have shown that the hydrogen production by mixed cultures could be directly correlated to the soluble sugar content of the substrates, easily accessible for the fermentative bacteria (Bai et al., 2004; Monlau et al., 2015; Yeshanew et al., 2016). Methane biodegradability was calculated considering the theoretical biomethane potential of the substrate, excluded the sugars fraction initially transformed into hydrogen. For this reason, methane biodegradability of raw KW, was 76% in mesophilic conditions at S/I = 0.5 and decreased to 61% at higher S/I ratio, while in thermophilic conditions the biodegradability was 67%, independent on the initial substrate to inoculum ratio. On the contrary, in the case of pretreated KW, mesophilic biodegradability of 67%–74% decreased to 62%–64% in thermophilic conditions, due probably to different pathways related to sugars fermentation into hydrogen. It is interesting to note that the sum of the calculated fermentability and biodegradability fractions match with the total VS degradation measured at the end of the tests. 2.2.4 Kinetic study Three models were used to estimate the batch tests performance parameters for both hydrogen and methane productions. Table 4 presents the results obtained with hydrogen and displays the goodness of fit: not all of the applications were satisfactory, however the reported correlation coefficient, when applicable, indicated an extremely good fitting (>0.9). Comparing the performance models, not surprisingly the best fit was obtained with the Gompertz model, modified or not, which achieved the highest regression coefficients (R 2 > 0.94). This result is in agreement with literature findings: Gompertz equation is the most frequently used model for hydrogen productions (Donoso-Bravo et al., 2010). Lag phase for thermophilic tests was significantly lower than the equivalent mesophilic ones, confirming the enhanced rates achievable at higher temperatures (Table 4). It is also evident the pretreatment effect on the substrate: the ultimate biogas potential and (S 0) and the biogas production rate (R m) underwent a considerable value increase. The different parameters (λ, R m, etc.) attained in the optimization analysis for methane production are summarized in Table 5 . The Gompertz equation provided the best fit, in terms of R 2. Analogous results were obtained in Pagliaccia et al. (2016), who studied the bioconversion of untreated and pretreated canteen food waste at an initial pH value of 7. In the case of pretreated sample at mesophilic temperatures (“M 0.5 P”), the lag phase λ did not exist. On the contrary, for the mesophilic trial at S/I = 1, λ was found to be > 11, thus highlighting that the pH inhibition caused by organic overload significantly lowered the production rate associated (−70%). Kinetic parameters such as lag phase, hydrolysis and methane rate could be significantly influenced by S/I ratio (Hobbs et al., 2018). Within this study, the S/I ratio affected the kinetic parameters only in mesophilic conditions. The higher the amount of inoculum the shorter was the lag phase for mesophilic methanogenesis, whereas in thermophilic conditions the lag phase did not vary significantly by increasing inoculum (Table 5). De Gioannis et al. (2017) studied the energy recovery from one- and two-stage anaerobic digestion of food waste. Results for hydrogen kinetic parameters were quite low if compared with those obtained in this study (S 0 = 58.6 mL H2/g VSfed; R m = 3.84 mL H2/gVSfed/hr; λ = 4.15 hr), possibly suggesting a difference in the carbohydrate content of the two types of food waste. On the other hand, the ultimate methane potential and the production rate (380.1 mL CH4/g VSfed and 2.37 mL CH4/gVSfed/hr) were similar to this study's results, whereas the lag phase was longer (20.4 hr), highlighting a lower initial degradability of the food waste used in De Gioannis et al. (2017). Lavagnolo et al. (2018) deepened the knowledge of the effect of process conditions (initial pH and S/I ratio) in two-stage anaerobic digestion of OFMSW. The kinetic parameters were lower than those of this study for both S/I trials, although more markedly for S/I = 1. Instead, with regard to methane parameters, considerably higher ultimate methane potentials (620 and 600 mL CH4/g VSfed for S/I = 0.5 and 1, respectively) and production rates (R m = 67.4 and 62.1 mL CH4/gVSfed/hr−1 for S/I = 0.5 and 1, respectively) were reported. These results could be a hint of a substrate richer in lipids and lower in carbohydrates content."
10,Conclusions,"A complete set of batch trials was carried out on a selected real KW to investigate effects due to pretreatment, temperature and S/I ratio. Pretreatment main effect was hydrogen production promotion as it was for increasing S/I ratio; the extent of this gain was highly variable according to the other parameters values (T, S/I ratio). It can be concluded that hydrogen yield is by far the most sensible variable to parameters modifications. Temperature favoured higher kinetics, reaching up to 78 mL CH4/gVS/day, acting as key player in overcoming pH inhibition. Inhibition and pH drop occurred very easily on a substrate rich in soluble available carbohydrates, especially for pretreated substrates. The initial low pH associated with a significant content of carbohydrates favoured fermentative bacteria activity (acidogenesis) resulting in VFAs accumulation, affecting the success of the process. The relatively low methane yields (354–380 mL CH4/g VSfed for untreated KW, and 342–398 mL CH4/g VSfed for pretreated KW), were justified by the consistent lignin and low lipid content, since the carbohydrates only fed the hydrogen producers. The integration of a thermal pretreatment could be considered as an attractive option for food waste to improve sugars solubilisation and consequent H2 production by dark fermentation."
