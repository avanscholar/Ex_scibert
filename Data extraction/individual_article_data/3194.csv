0,Introduction,"Recently, for alcohol detection many types of sensors such as optical, resistive, piezo-resistive, capacitive, gravimetric and magneto-elastic [1–5] have been demonstrated. In all reported devices, one basic perspective being high sensitivity towards physisorption of alcohol molecules and other being selectivity. This originates from the susceptibility of electronic structure of sensing element towards absorbing molecules. Due to high surface area with high areal defect density, carbon nanomaterials have emerged as fascinating materials [6–13] for sensing applications. Among them, particularly carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been successfully used for the sensing of gases such as NH3, H2, CH4, NO, NO2, etc. [14–17]. In these reports, variation in sensitivity was reported to be due to the charge transfer between CNT and an absorbed gas molecule. In reported devices, usually either surface modified, oxidized or functionalized CNTs has been used [10]. Besides CNTs, other carbon nano materials (CNMs) have also been used in wide range of sensing applications mainly due to their sensitivity towards any physical and chemical change occurring locally [18]. In recent reports, Polanyi theory is adopted to describe adsorption of molecules from gas as well as aqueous phases on carbon materials such as activated carbon, charcoal and CNTs [19–21]. According to this theory, adsorption capacity and affinity of carbon materials towards absorbents have two main aspects: one being limited by the potential space available on adsorbate for adsorbents and other being the strength of the net attractive forces between adsorbate and adsorbent. These attractive forces include van der Waals force as well as other forces caused due to hydrophobic effect, π−π electron-donor-acceptor interaction (EDA), hydrogen bonds, covalent and electrostatic interaction. Furthermore, in carbon materials the volume of adsorbent at a particular location depends upon the adsorption potential, i.e. energy required to remove the molecule from the location where attractive forces get minimized and on the effective separation between adsorbing molecule and surface atoms. Furthermore, in case of alcohol adsorption, the −OH group forms hydrogen bonds with graphite sheets of CNMs, where the benzene rings of graphite sheet act as the hydrogen–bonding acceptor [19,22]. It has also been reported that hydrogen bonds can also be formed between an organic molecule and CNMs if functional groups such as −COOH and −OH are present on the surface of CNMs [23,24]. These functional groups act as hydrogen-bonding donors. In further advances, hydrogen-bonding between a water molecule and functional groups present on CNMs was reported to be stronger than that between organic molecules and CNMs [19,24,25]. Previously, it was reported that covalent interaction between alcohol and CNMs occurs if they have functional groups such as −COOH, −OH and −NH2. This bonding interaction is much stronger than above-mentioned interactions. Furthermore, bamboo charcoal (BC) has emerged as promising adsorbent material due to its cost-effectiveness, renewability and environment-friendly nature [26]. In recent advances, due to their porous structure and large surface area as-produced and modified BC can adsorb many contaminants such as antibiotics [27], dibenzothiophene [28], nitrate-nitrogen [29], N-vinylpyrrolidone [30] in wastewater. Previously, Liao et al. [31] reported that BC and microwave assisted modify BC can be used for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) as well as acid oragne7 (AO7) in water. They found that hydrophobic, π-π and electrostatic interactions are mainly responsible for the adsorption of dyes instead of surface area, pore volume and H-bond interaction. As reported that in carbon-based absorbents, π-π interaction plays an important role in governing the adsorption of molecules which either accept or donate π-electron to graphene surfaces. Since, both AC and BC have a large fraction of graphene surface, therefore can be explored in sensing application. Recently, Lucky Krishnai et al. [32] have reported that various carbonaceous structures such as 3D nanographene oxide (3D-NGO), graphite nanodots (GNDs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and carbon onions are present in activated carbon (AC) which was produced from pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse. Their reported field emission studies reveal that as-pyrolyzed AC has semiconducting nature. In other application, S.C. Rabelo et al. [33] reported the usage of sugarcane bagasse for the production of bioethanol, methane and heat production in a bio-refinery but till date it is not used for alcohol sensing. In another report, Jiangtao Zhu et al. [34] demonstrated the synthesis of MWCNTs from bamboo charcoal and investigated the role minerals in CNT growth. In this work, we have successfully demonstrated that detection of alcohol such as iso-propyl alcohol, methanol and ethanol using a simple device fabricated with MWCNTs/BC/AC as a sensing element. The plausible explanation of detection is explained taking into account Polanyi theory and carrier's tunneling between two disordered regions which was being wetted by alcohol molecules. The comparative study reveals that BC and AC have higher sensitivity in comparison to MWCNTs whereas MWCNTs exhibit faster response and recovery time."
1,Experimental details,
2,Synthesis of MWCNTs,"2.1 Synthesis of MWCNTs MWCNTs were grown by using thermal chemical vapour deposition (Thermal-CVD) technique. Details of Thermal-CVD system have been reported elsewhere [35]. In our procedure, 25 mL solution of ferrocene/toluene mixture was taken. In this solution ferrocene was dissolved in toluene at a ratio of 0.02 g mL−1 and then sonicated before feeding into a pre-heating zone with a rate of 0.2 mL/minute. In order to ensure vapors of the mixture passed in reactor, hydrogen was used as carrier gas and flow rate was optimized and kept at 100 sccm. The growth temperature was kept at 840 °C. After completion of the growth process, system was allowed to cool down upto 200 °C in the presence of H2 and then as-deposited MWCNTs were scratched from the wall of quartz reactor and characterized by using SEM (Hitachi S3700 N) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM 2010 operated at 200 kV)."
3,Pyrolysis of bamboo charcoal,"2.2 Pyrolysis of bamboo charcoal Fresh bamboo was collected from a tree grown in Delhi region. The culms of bamboo were cut in the pieces of 5 mm wide by using a knife. Outer coverings of culms were removed and only the inner part of bamboo stem used in the pyrolysis process. In the pyrolysis process, self-thermochemical decomposition of bamboo culms at high temperature (1250 °C) for 12 h was carried out in an argon atmosphere. A heating rate was kept at 5 °C/min to minimize the thermal stress that may occur during the pyrolysis. The produced charcoals were allowed to cool down to 200 °C naturally in the inert atmosphere. More details of process have been reported elsewhere [36]."
4,Pyrolysis of activated carbon,2.3 Pyrolysis of activated carbon Activated carbon was produced by the pyrolysis of crushed powder of extracted sugarcane bagasse. Pyrolysis was carried out at 550 °C in the presence of argon atmosphere. More details of process are given in Ref. [32].
5,Device fabrication and sensing measurement,"2.4 Device fabrication and sensing measurement To fabricate the device, initially small amount of used carbonaceous structures were dispersed uniformly on a non-conducting flexible substrates (adhesive plastic tape) of the same area i.e.1 cm × 1 cm. Areal densities of MWCNTs, AC and BC in coated film was kept 15 mg/cm2. In order to make firmly adhered film, coating of used carbon materials have been done adhesive plastic tape and adherence was further tested with sudden jerking of the carbon film. Schematic representation of the steps involved in device fabrication and sensing is shown in Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 1, black region between two copper electrodes is either MWCNTs, BC or AC. The electrical contacts were made on the top of film using cello tape, and crocodile clip and then fabricated device was used for resistivity measurement. Initially, resistance (R0) was measured to insure the connectivity and then 1–10 μL pure alcohol was drop casted using syringe pump between two electrodes."
6,Result and discussion,
7,Characterization of carbon materials,"3.1 Characterization of carbon materials The surface morphology of MWCNTs, BC and AC was examined and SEM micrographs have been shown in Figs. 2a, 3a and 4 a, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2a, most of the as-grown MWCNTs possesses a uniform diameter and length. The diameter of MWCNTs was found to be in the range of 25–35 nm whereas length in micron. SEM micrograph of BC (Fig. 3 a) reveals that BC is porous in nature and observed particles were identified as silicon oxide which were either embedded or present in the pores. These particles were spherical in shape with a diameter in the range of 2–5 μm. As shown in Fig. 4 a &b, SEM micrographs of as-prepared AC were taken at different magnification and reveal that the AC possesses non-uniform sheet-like structure. These samples were further characterized via EDX for elemental analysis. The colored version in the lower part of Figs. 2–4 are the EDX spectral mapping images of MWCNTs, BC, and AC, respectively. The elemental mapping of MWCNTs reveals that rich carbon contents were present with iron either as a catalyst impurity or filler inside the CNT core in the form of Fe3C. Mapping of BC in lower panels in Fig. 3 reveals that carbon and silicon were the major contents along with some impurities like potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg). Similarly, we have performed the spectral mapping on AC as shown in lower part of Fig. 4 confirming the presence of carbon along with potassium (K) and calcium (Ca). Bright field TEM micrograph of MWCNT (Fig. 2b) reveals that few CNTs is partially filled with Fe3C as confirmed by lattice imaging and XRD analysis (results not shown), and TEM micrograph of BC (Fig. 3b) reveals that spherical nanoparticles of Si have diameter in range 0.5–2 μm and distributed uniformly in BC."
8,Sensing measurement,"3.2 Sensing measurement Sensitivity was monitored taking into account the variation of resistance with time as shown in Fig. 5 (a, c & e) for MWCNTs, BC and AC, respectively. Here, sensitivity is defined as: Sensitivity ( S ) = Δ R R 0 × 100 = ( R − R 0 ) R 0 × 100 where, R0 and R are the resistance before or after adsorption of alcohol, respectively. High sensitivity (∼200%) was observed in AC which is approximately five time higher than that for crystalline and ordered sp2 bonded network of MWCNTs. In the present case, the sensor is working on the principle of adsorption and desorption of alcohol molecules on the surface of the used carbonaceous structures. This can be evidenced by the fast recovery time of ∼90 s, 150 s and 100 s in MWCNTs, BC, and AC, respectively as shown in Fig. 5 b, d & f. There is a possibility that evaporation of IPA might change integrity of film but this possibility is negligible as evidenced by nearly 100% recovery of resistivity as shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, we presume that resistance increases either due to charge transfer between sensing material and alcohol molecules, carrier's scattering with alcohol molecule or electron tunneling at the CNT-CNT junctions. Considering first case, if charge transfer is taking place then resistance will not change after desorption of IPA molecules. Post-desorption reduction in resistance is only possible if scattering occurs. As per our observation when IPA is drop casted, first resistance increases linearly and then decreases exponentially. This exponential decrement can be understood as when volume of adsorbed IPA molecules reduces due to desorption. This reduction depends exponentially on the adsorption potential as well as the strength of attractive field forces. As reported by Daria Samazna et al. [37] and Ritu Malik et al. [38] charge transfer between absorbent like alcohol and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on Buckminsterfullerene and carbon nanomaterials occurred which enhances optical and electrical properties of the host. This enhancement in electrical conductivity has been monitored to detect the VOCs. Our observation was in well agreement with these reports. In our case, the response (R/Ro) is found to be 4 for ethanol detection using BC which is nearly equivalent to 5 as reported in graphitic carbon nitride [38]. Furthermore, all the measurements have been repeated and found to be consistent. In order to check the reusability of device after one year IPA sensing was again performed using the same device and performance was found to be consistant (Fig. 6 ). As reported by Fabian Schutt et al. [18] in MWCNTs film highly conductivity pathways formed on surface of film. Therefore, an explicit interpretation of resistance variation can be given as: initially, as liquid was drop casted on the sensing element (MWCNTs/AC/BC) it starts percolating through the CNT-CNT junction and through the pores in case of BC and AC. Consequently effective separation at CNT-CNT junction and pore interface increases. J. Lee et al. [39] reported that the resistance variation occurs due to the number of formed CNT-CNT junctions as well as percolated pathway through which electrons must tunnel. During electron tunneling, barrier at CNT-CNT and pore interface increases [39] and reduces the tunneling probability. This finally increases the resistance of network. In the present case, the observed fast response time is dependent on the percolation rate whereas recovery time depends on desorption rate. In order to determine the detection limit IPA was diluted to 5% (∼0.05 μL) and then sensing performance was monitored as shown in Fig. 7 (a–c). We have further tested the device for pure water, and it was observed that resistance does not change in case of MWCNTs as well as BC as shown in Fig. 8 (a&b). This might be due to the hydrophobic nature of these materials. Contrarily, resistance increased in case of AC which may be due to its hydrophilic nature. Hence, it can be concluded that 5% IPA diluted in pure water can be easily detected using this device. Furthermore, as evident from Fig. 7 (c), after drop casting 5% IPA/water mixture on BC resistance increases from 2.66 kΩ to 2.8 kΩ. This confirms that IPA-water mixture does not make the short circuit in BC films. The device was further tested for sensing of ethanol and methanol. As shown in Fig. 9 , for device made of MWCNT and BC the sensitivity was found to nearly equal for both ethanol and methanol whereas in case of AC it decreased to 50% than that observed for IPA. These result confirm that device can used for other alcohols too (see Table 1 )."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, a simple device has been fabricated for sensing of alcohol by using a film of MWCNTs/BC/AC (sensing element) deposited on a non-conducting plastic substrate. The fabricated device was operated at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Sensitivity was found to be high in case of AC and BC in comparison to MWCNTs whereas in terms of detection limit MWCNTs prove to be the superior ones. The present concept of device fabrication using these carbon materials as sensing elements is two-fold. Firstly, it would improve the detection limit of various alcohols diluted in water and in the other hand it would explore the potential application of these low-cost new materials (AC and BC) as sensing elements."
