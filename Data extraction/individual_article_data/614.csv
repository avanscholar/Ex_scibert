0,Introduction,"Biomass resources have received increasing attention as a potential alternative to fossil-based resources for the production of various important hydrocarbon chemicals of industry. This is because they represent a renewable, economic, and abundant alternative that can also serve as a substitutional fuel. Biomass pyrolysis produces a bio-oil consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons with oxygenated functional groups such as aldehyde, ketone, carbonyl, alcohol, and ester [1–6]. These hydrocarbons can be separated for further transformation to value-added renewable chemicals. Benzaldehyde is the main aldehyde compound from lignin biomass pyrolysis [7–9], and a promising renewable feedstock to produce the market favorited benzoic acid via oxidation [10]. Currently, benzoic acid is produced by the oxidation of petroleum based toluene on the bromide-promoted cobalt catalysts [11,12]. It is noticeable that the biomass-derived compounds from pyrolysis contain water, while, the catalytic oxidation on heterogeneous catalysts is generally performing in organic solvents. Photocatalysis offers a promising route for solvent-free selective oxidation of hydrocarbons in aqua-phase under mild operating conditions [13–16,81–86]. Specially, the photocatalysis can couple hydrogen generation with hydrocarbon oxidation in water solution: 1) Hydrocarbon oxidation reactions replace the water oxidation half-reaction to bypass O2 production and produce high value chemicals; 2) Aqueous protons are reduced to the solar fuel H2 in a closed redox cycle [17–20,87–89]. The photocatalytic system thereby catalyzes a closed redox cycle showing 100 % atom economy and generates a value-added chemical and a solar fuel [17–20,87–89]. Supported noble metal nanocatalysts are essential for driving both heterogeneous catalysis and photocatalysis. The size, shape, and surface electronic property are the main characteristics of noble metal nanocatalysts relating to their catalytic performance [21–24]. Based on the size of catalysts, there are three types of geometric and electronic structures of nanocatalysts: (1) single atoms with atomic orbitals at the sizes of ∼ 0.1 nm; (2) nanoclusters with molecular orbitals at the size of ∼1 nm; and (3) nanoparticles with metal at the size of ∼5 nm or bigger [25]. Thus their catalytic performance are virous for different reactions. Generally, noble metal nanocatalysts such as Pt with small sizes show outstanding activities in catalytic oxidation, and single atom Pt catalysts are more promising [26–28]. While a recent systematic investigation of Au, Pd, and Pt particles in photocatalytic H2 production shows a contrary trend that large particles seem to be more eﬃcient than smaller ones in proton reduction, since the importance of the metal is to pump away excited electrons [29]. When coupling the photocatalytic proton reduction to the organic substrate oxidation in one nanocatalyst, the overall catalytic performance of the catalyst is not the simple average of both reactions or compensation between them. The overall reaction rate of the closed redox cycle depends on the synergy of both reactions with photoexcited electrons and holes on nanocatalysts, which should also be strongly affected by the size and structure of noble metals. In order to discover the size/structure–function correlation for this promising photocatalytic system, we prepared supported Pt nanocatalysts from single atoms to nanoclusters and nanoparticles as the model catalysts, and evaluate their structure and catalytic performance for the coupled reactions of benzaldehyde oxidation and H2 production. As a mature material, polymeric carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been widely used in different photocatalysis process [30–38]. In this research, g-C3N4 is used as the support due to its visible light response [39,40], non-toxicity [41], and, most importantly, the proper semiconductor property for hydrogen reduction [42,43]."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of Pt catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of Pt catalysts A photo-deposition method was used to synthesize Pt catalysts on the home-made g-C3N4. The preparation of g-C3N4 followed the published method in ref. [36]. Specifically, 10 g urea was dispersed in the crucible and calcinated with cover under 550 °C in air for 4 h with the ramp rate as 2.3 °C /min. After cooling down to room temperature, the resultant light-yellow powder is the precursor material. In the photo-deposition session, 100 mg g-C3N4 was dispersed into the liquid mixture of 25 mL of water and 10 mL of methanol. Then proper amount of 8 wt.% hydrogen hexachloroplatinate (IV) solution (H2PtCl6, 13 μL, 26 μL, 52 μL, and 130 μL separately) were added in, corresponding to 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 5 wt% Pt loading amounts. The resultant slurry was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp under rigorous stirring without light filter for 2 h. Then the water was evaporated on the heat plate at 100 °C before further dehydration in a 60 °C oven overnight. The catalysts with different Pt-loading was obtained and proposed to be single atoms (0.5 wt%, SA-Pt), nano clusters (1 wt%, CL-Pt), nano particles (2 wt%, NP1-Pt; 5 wt%, NP2-Pt)."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Photocatalysts studied in this study were prepared by adopting a photo-deposition method. Specifically, aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 was mixed with g-C3N4 [36], followed by 2-h visible light irradiation to facilitate Pt immobilization. Resulting materials with different Pt loading was denoted as SA-Pt, CL-Pt, NP1-Pt, and NP2-Pt accordingly. After synthesis, the samples were collected via centrifugation, dried at 60 °C, and stored in dark until further characterization/catalytic test. To identify the layer structure of g-C3N4 and the crystal structure of Pt particles, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) was applied. XRD patterns were collected over PANalytical Xpert Pro powder diffractometer (45 kV and 40 mA) using the Cu Ka radiation (l=1.5405 Å). The scanning range for all samples was 10° to 70°. X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometry (XPS) was used to determine the bonding between different elements and it was collected on Thermo Fisher K Alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromated Al Ka X-ray was applied as the radiation source. The range of scan was 50 eV. The Pt content of the prepared catalysts is determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) carried out on PerkinElmer NexION™ 300X. The structure of the catalyst was high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) and HRTEM images were taken from JEOL-2200FS operating at 200 kV. High angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were acquired to identify Pt separation using a FEI Themis Z TEM equipped with double spherical aberration correctors working at 300 kV. The specific surface area was tested by nitrogen physical adsorption-desorption on Autosorb iQ-C. Solid UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was employed for bandgap identification as well as the light adsorption properties of catalysts. The test was conducted on a SHIMADZU UV-3600 UV–vis spectrometer equipped with a solid sample holder. The scanning region was 800 nm to 200 nm with a medium scanning rate and the sampling step interval was 1.0 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) tests were carried out on HORIBA iHR 320 fluorophotometer. In a typical test, 1 mg catalyst was pressed to a film on a glass base and the excitation light is irradiated on the sample directly. The excitation wavelength was 405 nm and the spectra between 200–800 nm was recorded. Mott-Schottky curves were measured with a home-made electrode. The electrode was made by throughout mixing 50 mg of the sample with 3 mL methanol before scraped 0.1 mL suspension on an (Fluorine doped Tin Oxide) FTO substrate and annealed in air at 300 °C for 0.5 h. As for the testing, the Mott-Schottky measurements were performed at a frequency of 10 Hz under a dark condition in 1.0 M NaOH. The Pt L3-edge X-Ray adsorption spectra were acquired under ambient conditions in fluence mode at beamline TLS 071A of National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), using a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator. The storage ring of NSRRC is operated at 1.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA in decay mode. The acquired data is processed by Demeter [44]."
4,Catalytic performance test,"2.3 Catalytic performance test Benzaldehyde oxidation and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were carried out in the photocatalysis reactor. In a typical experiment, 40 mg prepared catalyst was dispersed into 40 mL of deionized water containing 10 v% benzaldehyde (purified by redistillation, ≥99.5 %, Sigma- Aldrich) (over-saturated) as the scavenger. The system was initially purged with argon gas for 15 min and then vacuumed for another 15 min to get rid of the gases in the reactor. The system was then irradiated by a 300 W Xe arc lamp with a light filter to cutoff the light of which wavelength is shorter than 420 nm. The system was irradiated through the quartz window on the top of the reactor and a cooling jacket was applied to absorb the heat caused by the light irradiation. During the whole process, the suspension was stirred continuously. The gas phase product was analyzed by gas chromatography directly. The liquid phase product was tested via the following procedures: 60 μL slurry in the reactor was collected and diluted in 1 mL methanol. The sample was then filtered by a 0.22 um filter and analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with RTX-5@Wax column and fire ionized detector (FID). To determine the active intermediates generated during the reaction, the salicylic acid is applied as a hydroxyl (OH) radical scavenger [45–47]. In a typical experiment, 15 mg Pt-SA catalyst and 10 μL benzaldehyde are added into 20 mL 5 × 10−4 mol/L salicylic acid water solution. After 10 min. vacuum, the mixture is irradiated by 300 W Xe lamp with continuously stirring. The light filter is applied to cut-off the light under 420 nm. 2 mL of mixture is sampled in 30 min interval and the samples are tested by Agilent Cary 60 UV–vis spectrometer after filtration to determine the concentration of salicylic acid. For comparison, the mixture without benzaldehyde is tested as well."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization results,"3.1 Characterization results The ICP-MS (shown on Table S1 in Supporting information) indicates the Pt content of the different synthesized catalyst. Specifically, as shown on Table S1, the Pt content of SA-Pt, CL-Pt, NP1-Pt and NP2- Pt are determine to be 0.35 wt%, 0.80 wt%, 1.80 wt% and 5.70 wt% respectively. The porosity of the as-synthesized photocatalysts was examined by by 77 K N2 sorption experiments. The values of specific surface area for samples were calculated using Brunauer -Emmett -Teller (BET) model. As listed in the Table 1 , the specific surface areas of all prepared samples with different Pt loading are very similar (∼50 m2/g). Crystallinity of the photocatalysts was further analyzed using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) technique. As shown in the Fig. 1 a, a strong diffraction peaks at 27.4° can be found for all Pt catalysts, confirming the presence of layered g-C3N4 [48] in the resulting photocatalysts. Diffractions related to bulk Pt crystal are absence for SA-Pt and CL-Pt. This observation could be attributed to the presence of Pt catalysts with extreme small sizes such as the single atom or the nanocluster with few atoms. The diffraction peaks of Pt crystal centered at 39.8° and 46.2° can be observed for NP1-Pt (2 wt% Pt loading) and NP2-Pt (5 wt% Pt loading) with the increased amount of Pt loading, indicating the formation of Pt crystal nanoparticles with defined facets. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of Pt peak at 39.8° for NP1-Pt is 0.026 rads while 0.021 rads for NP2-Pt (Not labelled in figure). The mean size of Pt nanoparticles was calculated (Scherrer formula [49]) to be via 4.4 and 7.3 nm for NP1-Pt and NP2-Pt, respectively. HRTEM (the left column) and HAADF-STEM (the right column) images of Pt nanocatalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . The presence of Pt particles in the assynthesized Pt/g-C3N4 samples are confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping (Fig. S4). The Pt nanocatalysts (pointed by arrows or in the red cycles, Fig. 2) are presented with black and white contrast in the HRTEM and HAADF-STEM images, respectively. HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 2 a2) of SA-Pt shows the homogeneous distribution of bright single dots on the surface of catalyst. The diameter of each bright dots is measured to be between 0.1 to 0.2 nm, corresponding to the diameter of atomic Pt (0.177 nm). The distance between bright dots is calculated to be around1 nm and separated from each other, confirming the Pt species as single atoms catalyst [50,51]. Increasing the Pt loading will result in the escalating of surface Pt atoms and the formation of nanoclusters. For CL-Pt (1 wt% Pt), HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 2 b2) shows the presence of Pt nanoclusters grouped with 4–10 atoms on the catalyst surface. Lattice can not be detected for the Pt nanoclusters in CL-Pt. This correlates well with the XRD results as shown in Fig. 1 a, in which no diffraction peaks assigned to bulk Pt crystal can be detected. The Pt nanoparticles with average size of ca. 4 nm were clearly observed on NP1-Pt (2 wt% Pt loading, Fig. 2 c1). HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 2 c2) confirmed the defined crystallite facets of Pt nanoparticles with the lattice panel distances of 0.20 nm and 0.22 nm. These values match well with the Pt lattice constant and lattice planes of (200) and (111) [52]. When increasing Pt loading to 5 wt%, the Pt nanoparticles grew bigger with an average size of ca. 7 nm for NP2-Pt (Fig. 2 d1). HAADF-STEM image also confirms the formation of well-ordered lattices of Pt (111) plane with the lattice distance of 0.22 nm. The extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS) result provides solid evidence of single atom Pt structure. According to Fig. 3 a, in the X-ray adsorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of Pt L3-edge, the white line of Pt-SA is higher than the one for Pt foil, revealing the higher oxidation status of Pt on SA-Pt [53]. In k3-weighted Fourier transformation of Pt L3 edge (Fig. 3 b), the Pt-Pt bond, which located at 2.6 Å can only be found in Pt foil reference [54–57]. As for Pt-SA sample, the Pt-Pt bond is hard to be observed, and the intense band at 1.5 Å is attributed to single atom Pt stabilized by N [54,55]. This result reveals that, for SA-Pt sample, the Pt is finely dispersed on g-C3N4 as Pt single atom and stabilized by N sites. For the prepared Pt single atom (SA-Pt), nanocluster (CL-Pt), and nanoparticle catalysts (NP1-Pt & NP2-Pt), XPS analysis was used to investigate their surface functionality and electronic property. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4 a displays the Pt 4f XPS spectrum of SA-Pt. Deconvoluted peaks at 76.0 eV and 72.7 eV are assigned to Pt2+ [58]. According to the XPS and extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS) results, Pt single atom is nearly 100 % dispersion in SA-Pt (Fig. 4 a) and more likely to be stabilized by N sites on g-C3N4 during sample preparation [59–61]. Similar for Pt cluster with the highly dispersion, two strong peaks at 76.0 eV and 72.7 eV for the spectrum of CL-Pt (Fig. 4 b) are originated from the oxidation of Pt in the air. Two new peaks at 75.4 eV and 72.0 eV in Fig. 4 b are appeared and assigned to the Pt° atoms [54]. This result hints that a portion of Pt atoms (6.7 %) are not exposed to the nanocluster surface and cannot be oxidized in air. For NP1-Pt, the dispersion of Pt atoms on surface is still high and two peaks at 76.0 eV and 72.7 eV for Pt2+ are still dominant in the XPS spectrum as shown in Fig. 4 c. As an increase in Pt nanocatalyst size, more Pt° atoms are embedded in the bulk particles and not available to be oxidized by the surface oxygen from air. Therefore, the proportion of Pt° species signaled at 75.0 eV and 71.5 eV for NP1-Pt increased to 9.3 %, which are further increased to 31.9 % for NP2-Pt. Meanwhile, Pt° peaks are slightly shifted to lower bonding energy from 75.0 eV and 71.5 eV for NP1-Pt to 74.6 eV and 71.2 eV for NP2-Pt. It indicates that the electrons are spontaneously pumped to larger Pt particles from supports, which reduces its oxidation property, but enhance the reduction ability. In the N 1s XPS spectra, three types of nitrogen are observed in the catalysts which are C=N-C in aromatic ring structure (398.5 eV), N-(C)3 (399.6 eV), and N-H on the edge of the catalyst (400.9 eV) [62,63]. After Pt loading, the fraction of integral areas of C-N = C peak increased with the decreased of N-(C)3 and N-H (Fig. 4 e and f). It illustrates the interaction between Pt and N on the surface. Meanwhile, the C XPS spectra (Fig. S2) doesn’t show any change after the Pt loading. To double confirm the interaction between Pt and N, the N 1s EELS of bare g-C3N4 and SA-Pt is acquired. Shown on Fig. S5 the pre-peak of N 1s EELS of SA-Pt at 404 eV is stronger than the one of g-C3N4 while the second peak at 415 eV of SA-Pt is narrower than the g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the N-1 s EELS spectrum of SA-Pt has a slightly shift to lower energy loss region compared to the pristine g-C3N4. Both of these evidences indicate that electron density of N atoms on SA-Pt is slightly higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 [64], indicating that the interaction between N and Pt will lead an increased electron density to the N atoms [59–61]."
7,Photocatalytic property and reaction activity,"3.2 Photocatalytic property and reaction activity The solid-state UV–vis diffusion reflectance spectra were collected to determine the light absorption properties and semiconductor property of the Pt catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1 b, the wavelength of light adsorption edge of the Pt catalysts is above 400 nm, suggesting that visible light can be adsorbed and utilized by these catalysts. Immobilization of Pt nanocatalysts on g-C3N4 does not trigger remarkable change to the catalysts’ light-absorbance properties, especially for single atom and nanocluster Pt catalysts (SA-Pt and CL-Pt). Surface anchoring of Pt nanoparticles will slightly decrease the light absorbance of g-C3N4, due to the light-blocking effect [65,66]. The excitation energy (displayed on Fig. 1c) calculated from the UV–vis diffusion reflectance spectra are around 2.60∼2.64 eV, almost the same for g-C3N4, SA-Pt, CL-Pt, and NP1-Pt. This energy required for NP2-Pt with bigger Pt nanoparticles is 2.72 eV, slightly higher than other catalysts. The efficiency of charge carrier separation is essential to the photocatalytic process. Lower recombination is reported to be advantageous to the photocatalytic performance [67,68]. Here, the single point photoluminescence (PL) spectra are recorded and shown in Fig. 5 a. The SA-Pt had the lowest PL signal intensity, which means it displayed the best charge carrier separation property. The fluorescent intensity increased as the increasing of Pt size from single atom to nanocluster and nanoparticles, indicating that large Pt crystallites will trigger undesired carrier recombination [55,69,70]. The Mott-Schottky curve shown in Fig. 5 b reveals the photo-induced carrier density in the catalyst. According to the Mott-Schottky equation: N d = 2 e 0 ε ε 0 d 1 C 2 d v - 1 where ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.86 × 10−12 F/m); ε is the dielectric constant; e0 is electron charge (1.6 × 10-19 C) [71,72]. As an electrochemical property, the lower slope of the tangential line (dash line in the figure) indicates the higher charge carrier concentration. Based on these results (Fig. 5 b), the slope for pristine g-C3N4, SA-Pt, CL-Pt and NP1-Pt are almost the same, which means the Pt-loading and particle size will not influence the carrier density in resulting catalysts. Furthermore, the flat-band position change on Mott-Schottky plot suggests the position change of conduction band of n-type semiconductor, which is g-C3N4 in this case, with different Pt loading amount [73]. Due to the generation of Schottky junction, after the platinum loading, the conduction band and the valance band will be moving to match the Fermi level of platinum to produce a proper electron structure to drive the reaction [28]. Since the Fermi level of Pt can be controlled by its own size, this conduction band shift provides another evidence that the semiconductor base is successfully combined with Pt with different particle sizes. In combination of XRD, HRTE, HAADF-STEM, and XPS analysis, the successful preparation of a series of Pt/g-C3N4 catalysts was confirmed. The immobilized Pt particles can be fine-tuned from sing atom to nanosize range, which offers us an ideal platform to study the relationship between Pt particle size and its photocatalytic performance. The catalytic performance of Pt nanocatalysts in dual oxidation/H2 production was then be tested and the experimental results were summarized in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6 a, the benzaldehyde conversions over Pt catalysts are increased proportionally along with the reaction time. Benzoic acid is the only product during the oxidation. Among the catalysts, the single atom catalysts SA-Pt displays much higher reaction activity than other Pt nanocatalysts. The benzaldehyde conversion over SA-Pt reaches 70.8 mmol/gPt during 3 h reaction period, whereas only 42.1 mmol/gPt, 13.1 mmol/gPt, and 5.5 mmol/gPt for CL-Pt, NP1-Pt and NP2-Pt, respectively. It is worth to noting that the superior Pt dispersion in SA-Pt and CL-Pt catalysts, alone, cannot rationalize the enhancement of the benzaldehyde oxidation. In the SA-Pt catalyst, the photon-induced charge carrier is more likely to be trapped by the single Pt atom [55]. This effect guarantees the efficiency of charge splitting and restrain the recombination during the dual reactions in photocatalysis. On the contrary, the large Pt particle potentially provides a stage to trap both photo-induced electrons and holes, which reduces the photocatalysis rate of hydrogen production from proton reduction with electron and of benzaldehyde oxidation with hole. Considering the oxidation step is generally the bottleneck of the overall photocatalytic reaction [74], the outstanding oxidation performance of SA-Pt and CL-Pt catalysts consumed large amount of holes, which might contribute more electrons for proton reduction and enhance the H2 production in the parallel HER reaction. As shown in Fig. 6 b, the single atom catalyst also demonstrates a supreme activity with the hydrogen generation over 34 mmol/gPt in 3 h reaction time. The amount of produced hydrogen is almost half to the amount of oxidized benzaldehyde, which is consistent to the electron donation/consumption rate for proton reductions (2 electrons for 1 H2) with the rate for oxidation (1 hole for 1 acid). Similarly, the CL-Pt generate 17.5 mmol/gPt over 3 h, which is also half to the corresponding benzaldehyde conversion. In comparison, NP1-Pt and NP2-Pt (with large Pt NPs deposition) displayed an inferior performance in hydrogen generation, with the values of 5.5 mmol/gPt and 8.0 mmol/gPt for NP1-Pt and NP2-Pt, respectively. Among Pt nanoparticles, the H2 yield on large size NP2-Pt is actually higher than the one of the small size NP1-Pt. It indicates the oxygen generation reaction (OER) is simultaneously occurred on large Pt particles with benzaldehyde oxidation, which increased more electrons pumped for the more hydrogen generation during HER."
8,Proposed photocatalysis mechanism,"3.3 Proposed photocatalysis mechanism Like the photocatalytic water splitting process, the closed redox cycle includes the benzaldehyde oxidation half-reaction and proton reduction half-reaction on the supported Pt nanocatalysts as shown in Scheme 1 . The fermi level of the metal particles is size-dependence, and a smaller metal size generally provides a lower fermi level [75]. The fermi level of Pt single atom is lower than fermi level of Pt particles. When the photocatalyst has been excited by light irradiation, the photo-induced electrons were excited to the CB of g-C3N4 and might be prohibited to flow into single Pt atoms. Then the corresponding holes were accumulated on SA-Pt sites and reacted with benzaldehyde to form the Ph-CO· radicals and protons [76,77]. The water molecule was then activated to hydroxyl radicals by Ph-CO· radical. To confirming that hydroxyl radical is the key active specie, the salicylic acid is applied as the scavenger of OH radicals. Based on the results shown on Fig. S6, the concentration of salicylic acid is continuously dropping down along with the reaction, which determines that OH radical is generated continuously during the photocatalytic oxidation of benzaldehyde. This indicates that, like published by other reports. the hydroxyl radical is the key intermediate for benzaldehyde oxidation in this reaction [78,79]. Since water is the only oxygen source in this reaction system, it is reasonable to assume the generation of hydroxyl radical is relying on the participation of water. Meanwhile, this result also suggests the hydroxyl radical can not be generated without benzaldehyde. This reflects the benzaldehyde is the key of generating OH radicals, further confirming our proposed mechanism. Two hydroxyl radicals together could be transferred to a long OOH· radicals [80], which could combine with the Ph-CO· radicals to generate Ph-COOOH. Ph-COOOH is unstable and easy to be reacted with benzaldehyde to produce benzoic acid [76,77,81]. Therefore, the holes have been quickly consumed via the benzaldehyde oxidation half reaction and the free electrons on catalyst surface could reduce the protons to hydrogen in another half-reaction. Then the redox cycle was closed as shown in Scheme 1. The fast carriers’ separation and utilization on SA-Pt promoted the overall reaction process. For Pt nanocatalysts with larger sizes, such as CL-Pt and NP-Pt, immobilized Pt particles increased its ability to trap the photo-induced electrons. It decreased the density of holes on the surface due to the enhanced opportunity for the recombination with electrons. Therefore, both reaction rates of benzaldehyde oxidation with holes and proton reduction with electrons decreased."
9,Conclusion,"In conclusion, benzaldehyde oxidation was successfully conducted with simultaneous di-hydrogen evolution in a photocatalytic reaction. This study exemplifies a proof-of-concept case which combine the synthesis of value-added chemicals with the production of clean fuel in a closed photo-redox cycle. The size-engineered Pt/g-C3N4 catalysts were successfully synthesized using a straightforward photo-deposition method, to evaluate the particle size effect on the overall reaction rate. Solid-state UV–vis diffuse reflectance and Mott-Schottky tests show that the value of semiconductor property and carrier densities are similar for all the Pt-modified g-C3N4 samples (single atom, nanocluster, and nanoparticle catalysts). The yield of benzaldehyde conversion over SA-Pt (with single Pt atoms) reaches 49.5 mmol/gPt, which is higher than that of CL-Pt (33.7 mmol/gPt, with Pt nanoclusters), NP1-Pt (11.9 mmol/gPt, with4 nm Pt particles), and NP2-Pt (6.3 mmol/gPt, with 7 nm Pt particles). The H2 evolution rates followed a similar trend as the oxidation single atom (24 mmol/gPt) > nanocluster (14.0 mmol/gPt) > nanoparticle (4.9 mmol/gPt and 9.1 mmol/gPt). The amount of di-hydrogen product is halved to the amount of oxidation production (benzaldehyde). This is consistent to the electron donation/consumption rate for proton reductions (2 electrons for 1 H2) with the rate for oxidation. The observed reactivity enhancement for Pt single atom catalyst is not only attributed to its excellent dispersion, but also to its preference for photo-induced holes delivery, which favor the outstanding oxidation. Then more free electrons are accumulated on the catalysts for proton reduction and enhance the H2 production for another half reaction HER. While the big Pt particles tend to trap both electrons and holes on the surface, facilitating the electron-hole recombination, which is deleterious to the overall redox reaction rates. Thus, this research not only provides a promising way to manufacture renewable chemicals and clean fuels with 100 % atom economy, but also elucidate the high potential of applying single atom catalysts in sustainable artificial photosynthesis reactions."
