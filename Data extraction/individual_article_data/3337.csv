0,Introduction,"Second generation biofuel can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass, such as sugarcane bagasse (SCB), which consists mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin (Cao and Aita, 2013). Bagasse is the solid biomass that remains after the sugarcane juice extraction in the sugar and alcohol mill, which in addition to straw corresponds to about 35 % of the total cane weight (Rocha et al., 2015). However, the cell wall of lignocellulosic biomass has limited porosity, mainly due to the strong interaction between lignin and hemicellulose, which results in high recalcitrance of the fiber to enzymatic degradation (de Souza et al., 2013). The complex cellular anatomy of sugarcane can be separated in the outer-most part (rind) and the inner region (pith) which consists mainly of vascular bundles and parenchyma cells, respectively (Siqueira et al., 2011). After the processing, the remaining internal and external fractions of SCB (pith and rind, respectively) still have specific recalcitrance. Therefore, their characterization is essential to explain its potential bioconversion into value-added products. Relatively little is known about sugarcane bagasse heterogeneity, with its composition as the most studied analysis for quantification of cellulose lignin and hemicellulose. Another factor, such as, anatomy, chemical composition, crystallinity, and lignin distribution in the sugarcane bagasse affect the accessibility of this biomass to enzymatic attack, and consequently needs to be evaluated in order to apply this biomass in biotechnological approaches. A pretreatment step is necessary to disrupt the recalcitrant structures of the SCB and enhance its accessibility for the enzymatic attack (Batista et al., 2019). In this sense, hydrothermal technology is one of the most favorable pretreatments, once it uses only water in the reaction, preventing mechanical problems such as corrosion, as well as environmental problems like effluent contamination (Datar et al., 2007). The hydrothermal pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse results mainly in a solid fraction, more reactive to enzymatic hydrolysis than the untreated fibers, rich in cellulose and lignin, and a liquid fraction mainly constituted by pentoses liquor and inhibitor compounds such as furfural and 5-hydroxymetilfurfural (5-HMF), according to the pretreatment severity (Ahmad et al., 2018). Besides pretreatments, many different parameters can influence the AD process, such as pH, temperature, inoculum source, nitrogen availability, heterogeneity and concentration of substrate. Hydrogen production occurs mainly at pH between 4.5 and 7.0, while organic acids, such as butyric and lactic are favored at pH 5.3 and 3.5, respectively (Antonopoulou et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2012). In contrast, pH above 7 plays an important role to reduce adverse effects on the methanogenic archaea (Zheng et al., 2019). Clostridium and Thermoanaerobacterium are the main genera identified in fermentative reactors using sugarcane-derived biomass (Fuess et al., 2018; Oliveira et al., 2019; Soares et al., 2019) and play an important role in the hydrogen production from complex substrate. In the same way, low pH acid resistant microorganisms, such as lactic acid bacteria from the Lactobacillus or Lactococcus genera, can express some resistance mechanisms like the formation of dextran, reuteran, levan and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) (Su et al., 2011) in order to survive under stress conditions and produce lactic acid. Finally, the organic acids, CO2 and H2 generated by acetogenic bacteria, can be used for acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea, which convert these substrates into methane in the final step of AD. Based on the above, the anatomy, chemical composition, and crystallinity of SCB were investigated in detail to understand the chemical and structural characteristics that contribute to lignocellulosic biomass recalcitrance. In addition, the untreated and hydrothermally pretreated fractions were anaerobically digested in order to determine the effect of pretreatment and heterogeneity on biofuel production and fermentative microbial pathways."
1,Material and methods,
2,Sugarcane bagasse and hydrothermal pretreatment,"2.1 Sugarcane bagasse and hydrothermal pretreatment Industrial sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was provided by São Martinho sugar mill (Pradópolis – SP, Brazil).Pith and rind fraction was air dried, separated using sieve (Rezende and Pimenta, 2015)and storage at room temperature. Laboratorial SCB was produced at the Biological Process Laboratory from the São Paulo University (LPB-USP). Rind and pith regions of laboratorial SCB were excised cutting transverse sections (Siqueira et al., 2011). The hydrothermal (HT) pretreatment (200 °C for 10 min at 16 bar) (Soares et al., 2017) was performed in the SCB (10 g of SCB mixed with 100 mL of water). It is important to highlight that the industrial pith fraction was completely converted into hydrolyzed liquor in the applied pretreatment severity."
3,Sugarcane bagasse characterization,"2.2 Sugarcane bagasse characterization Chemical components of SCB, such as cellulose (glucan), hemicellulose (arabinan, xylan, acetyl groups) (Brienzo et al., 2016), and Klason lignin were determined using NREL’s Laboratory Analytical Procedures (Sluiter et al., 2012). This procedure was performed in the Centre of Biological Engineering, University of Minho, Campus of Gualtar, Braga, Portugal. The SCB crystallinity was determined by X-ray diffractometer and the crystallinity index (CrI) was calculated according to the empirical formula proposed by (Segal et al., 1959) at the Chemical institute of São Carlos, São Paulo University, Brazil."
4,Anaerobic digestion,"2.3 Anaerobic digestion Unpretreated and hydrothermally pretreated SCB pith and rind fractions (Table 1 ) were used as substrate (10 g/L) for anaerobic digestion in 100 mL batch reactors. The microbial source was a thermophilic sludge (10 % v/v) from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating vinasse provided by the São Martinho distillery plant, located in Pradópolis, SP, Brazil (Soares et al., 2018). The experiment was carried out in duplicate using the PCS medium (Wongwilaiwalin et al., 2010). The initial pH was adjusted to 6.0. The reactors were submitted to N2 atmosphere for 10 min, closed with rubber stoppers and plastic stoppers and incubated at 55 °C."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Hydrogen and methane in the biogas were measured using gas chromatography (GC 2010 Shimadzu system) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Carboxen 1010 PLOT column (30 m x 0.53 mm) according to (Ratti et al., 2013). Volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic, butyric, isobutyric, valeric, isovaleric and caproic acids) and sugars (glucose, sucrose, xylose, galactose, and arabinose) were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) equipped with a UV diode array detector (SPD-M10 AVP), a refraction index detector (RID-10A), a CTO-20A oven, an LC-10 ADVP Pump, an SCL 10 AVP control, an Aminex HPX-87H column (300 mm × 7.8 mm) (BioRad) and H2SO4 (0.01 N) at 0.5 mL min − 1 flow rate as eluent (Penteado et al., 2013). The solvents, such as methanol, ethanol and n-butanol were analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC/FID) according to the protocol described by (Adorno et al., 2014)."
6,Kinetic analysis,"2.5 Kinetic analysis The hydrogen experimental data was adjusted to the average values obtained from duplicates using the software package Statistica® 8.0. The produced and accumulated hydrogen was adjusted using the Gompertz equation, modified by (Zwietering et al., 1990)(Eq. 1). (1) H = P ∙ exp - exp R m ∙ e P λ - t ) + 1 Where: P – Potential production of H2 (mmol l-1), Rm – Production Rate of H2 (mmol L h-1), t – time of incubation (h), e – Euler number (2.71828) and λ – time to start the H2 production (h)."
7,Sequencing,"2.6 Sequencing Samples from the reactors C4, C5 and C7 (Laboratorial untreated rind, Industrial HT pretreated rind, and Industrial untreated pith, respectively) were collected at the end of the operational period. Total DNA extraction was performed using phenol and chloroform protocol, according to(Griffiths et al., 2000). The V3 and V4 regions of 16S rRNA gene were sequenced in a Miseq - Illumina platform (2 × 300bp PE illumina), using the primer sets 515 F (GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806R (GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT) for Bacteria and Archaea. Confidence and identity higher than 80 and 97 %, respectively, was used to group the sequence into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The sequences from C4, C5 and C7 were submitted to the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under the bioprojects PRJNA632916, PRJNA632921, PRJNA632922, respectively."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Fiber composition and characterization,"3.1 Fiber composition and characterization In the chemical composition analysis (Table 2 )a slight difference was observed on the cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, acetyl groups, and crystallinity index (CI) as a response of heterogeneity and hydrothermal pretreatment (HT) of sugarcane bagasse (SCB). In the laboratorial and industrial untreated SCB, cellulose, hemicellulose (%), and CI were higher in the rind than in the pith fraction. Although there was a small difference in the pith and rind composition, it reflects the heterogeneity of these fractions and consequently recalcitrance. Cellulose, hemicellulose and CI from laboratorial and industrial rind were higher than in the pith fraction. It is probably a result of the physical effect of the fiber grinding on the sugar and ethanol mill for the extraction of sugar juice. In the same way, cellulose and hemicellulose predominated in the rind fraction of both laboratorial and industrial SCB. Considering the hemicellulose, it is in agreement with (Siqueira et al., 2011)who reported 30 and 24 % of hemicellulose content in rind and pith, respectively. According to these authors, the rind fraction is more recalcitrant than pith once it mainly consists of vascular bundles like vessels and surrounding fibers, while parenchyma cells form the pith region. Hydrothermal pretreatment also affected the laboratorial and industrial SCB composition. The same profile was observed for rind and pith as a response of HT pretreatment, once cellulose and lignin content increased in the hydrothermally pretreated SCB, while hemicellulose, acetyl groups, and CI decreased after the pretreatment. The fiber characterization using Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) is presented as Supplementary Material. Considering the pith fraction of laboratorial SCB, hemicellulose removal was 71.6 %, varying from 26.8 % to 7.6 % in the untreated and HT treated fiber, respectively. This removal was 73.8 and 61.4 % considering laboratorial and industrial rind fractions. Lower hemicellulose removal from industrial SCB rind reflects the difference in the material characteristic, as heterogeneity and consequent recalcitrance. Hemicellulose removal, lignin modification, and disruption of fiber organization are consequences of pretreatments (Brienzo et al., 2016). Cellulose content increased with the HT pretreatment of SCB laboratorial pith, laboratorial and industrial rind from 43.7, 45.0, and 42.5 % to 62.0, 63.9, and 59.8 %, respectively. It was probably a response to the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in hemicellulose catalyzed by organic acids produced during the HT pretreatment, which relatively increase the cellulose content (Sun et al., 2014). Hydrothermal pretreatment also affects the cellulose crystallinity, which is an important parameter to evaluate the biomass recalcitrance, once it affects the bioconversion efficiency of the lignocellulosic biomass into biofuel (Kumari and Das, 2019). In all the conditions the CI was reduced as a response of hemicellulose removal from the HT pretreatment (from 41.2, 48.0, and 43.8–33.5, 45.9, 37.0 % in laboratorial pith fraction, laboratorial and industrial rind fractions, respectively), indicating the reduction of fiber recalcitrance after the HT pretreatment. The cellulose CI for unpretreated rind and pith fraction was in close agreement (46–48 %) with those reported by (Brienzo et al., 2016). On the other hand, lignin content in the HT pretreated SCB increased in relation to the untreated fiber (from 19.8, 21.6, and 21.6–23.3, 23.6, and 23.9 %, % in laboratorial pith fraction, laboratorial and industrial rind fractions, respectively). Increase in the lignin content was attributed to the concomitant polysaccharides losses and pseudo-lignin formation as a result of HT pretreatment (Pu et al., 2013). The modification on the lignin structure can negatively affect the enzymatic hydrolysis, once it causes droplets formation in the pretreated fiber, limiting enzyme access to cellulose. In contrast, it can also cause the migration of lignin or its fragments to a surface and localized region, which could be as important as lignin removal, once it increases cellulose accessibility (Pu et al., 2013). In addition, a multisite noncompetitive inhibition mechanism has been described, in which more than one aromatic molecule can interact with the cellulose and/or hemicellulose enzymes to promote inhibition and also its complete inactivation. However, there is hardly any information regarding the nature of the interactions or the inhibitory mechanisms of hydrolytic enzymes by lignin (dos Santos et al., 2019)."
10,Second-generation biofuel production,"3.2 Second-generation biofuel production The hydrogen production obtained from pretreated and unpretreated SCB pith and rind are shown in Fig. 1 . The hydrogen production (Table 3 ) was higher using HT pretreated SCB (C1, C2, and C5), while low H2 production was obtained using unpretreated SCB (C6 and C7). Hydrothermal pretreatment was an effective pretreatment method, which increased the hydrogen production by 81.8 % considering the industrial SCB rind. From Miscanthus, a promising lignocellulosic source of bioenergy with high lignocellulose content, (Zhou et al., 2017) reported increase of 49.7 % in the biogas production as a response of HT pretreatment. In the same way, (Soares et al., 2018) evaluated the effect of HT pretreatment (210 °C for 15 min) of SCB on hydrogen production and reported maximum of 0.89 mmol H2 using untreated SCB and 1.11 89 mmol H2 using HT pretreated SCB. However the time to start the hydrogen production increased from 14.05–17.55 h using the HT pretreated fibers, indicating the presence of some inhibitors, such as furfural and 5-HMF, which was not observed in the present study, probably due to the lower severity applied (200 °C for 10 min). The highest hydrogen production (33.77 mmol/L) was obtained in the laboratorial pretreated SCB rind (C2), which had the highest cellulose content (63.9 %) and hemicellulose removal (73.8 %). High cellulase efficiency was observed in HT pretreated Miscanthus (Zhou et al., 2017) and SCB (Santucci et al., 2015) as a function of hemicellulose removal caused by the pretreatment. In high temperature HT pretreatment, as applied in the present study (200 °C), more intensive hydrolysis of acetyl groups occurs, releasing acetic acid to the reaction medium, which increases the removal of lignocellulosic components (Santucci et al., 2015) and improving cellulose digestibility. The main lignocellulosic compound solubilized by HT pretreatment is hemicellulose (Santucci et al., 2015). No hydrogen production was obtained using laboratorial unpretreated SCB pith (C3) and rind (C4) probably due to the pH drop in these conditions, from 6.0–4.16 and 4.07, respectively. According to (Antonopoulou et al., 2010)reduction in hydrogen production was observed at pH of around 4.6, while it ceased at pH lower than 4.0 with predominance of lactic and ethanol metabolic pathways. Lactic bacteria, such as Lactobacillus genus, widely found in bioreactors fed with vinasse and molasses, are extremely tolerant to acidic pH (Fuess et al., 2018), and potentially contribute to the lactic acid produced in this study. In contrast, the pH of the other experiments using unpretreated SCB rind and pith was 7.18 and 7.11 in C6 and C7, respectively, which is suitable for methanogenesis process once according to (Li et al., 2019) methanogenic archaea has poor adaption to pH variation, which for them the optimum pH is 6.5–7.5. While in the high hydrogen production conditions (C1, C2 and C5) the observed pH was 6.4. Methane production (5.53 and 3.16 mmol/L) was obtained from industrial untreated SCB rind (C6) and pith (C7), respectively (Fig. 2 ). No traces of methane were observed in the other conditions, probably due to the low pH observed in these conditions. Absence of methane as a response of low pH (3.9–4.6) was also reported by Ferreira et al. (2019) using sugarcane juice as substrate in anaerobic fluidized bed reactors under mesophilic (30 °C) and thermophilic (55 °C) conditions. The main pathways for methane production are hydrogenotrophic (Eq. 2), acetoclastic (Eq. 3) and methylotrophic (Eq. 4) pathways, in which H2+CO2, acetic acid and methyl compound are used as substrate, respectively (Conrad, 2020). (2) 4H2 + CO2 → CH4 + 2H2O (3) 2CH3COOH → 2CH4 + 2CO2 (4) 4CH3OH → CO2 + 2H2O + 3CH4 From the complete bioconversion of cellulose into methane, 67 % are derived from acetoclastic methanogenesis, while 33 % are the result of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. However these two principal methanogenic pathways can contribute from zero to 100 % for the methane production according to the substrate, temperature, partial or complete degradation and other intrinsic parameters (Conrad, 2020). Dissecting the microbial community structure of methane-producing pathways of a full-scale anaerobic reactor, (Guo et al., 2015) described that Methanosarcina uses the low-affinity acetate kinase (AK)-phosphotransacetylase (PTA) system for syntheses of acetyl-CoA. On the other hand, the high-affinity adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase is utilized by Methanosaeta, while methanol-specific corrinoid protein is used for methylotrophic archaea such as Methanosphaera (Guo et al., 2015). For hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis a series of intermediates levels are required for methanogenic archaea, such as Methanoculleus for CO2 reduction into CH4. Finally, in all these pathways, methyl coenzyme M reductase (Mcr) is responsible for reducing methyl-CoM to methane (Guo et al., 2015). Besides hydrogen and methane, volatile fatty acids (Fig. 3 ) and ethanol were also produced from SCB. In condition C2, where the highest hydrogen production was reached, the highest VFAs production (9.3 g/L) was also observed, with 6.1 g/L of butyric acids. High VFAs production was also obtained in condition C1(8.6 g/L) with 4.7 g/L of butyric acid. Hydrogen production via fermentation can be produced in two main pathways with acetic (Eq. 5) or butyric acid production (Eq. 6). (5) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 C H 3 C O O H + 4 H 2 + 2 C O 2 (6) C 6 H 12 O 6 → C H 3 ( C H 2 ) 2 C O O H + 2 C O 2 + 2 H 2 In conditions C3 and C4, with no hydrogen production, 7.6 and 4.6 g/L of VFAs were produced, respectively. It is important to highlight that in both conditions, high lactic acid was produced (1.5 and 1.3 g/L, respectively). Lactic bacteria can produce antimicrobial peptides which have inhibitory effect on the hydrogen production (Gomes et al., 2015) and probably had a significant effect in this study. In condition (C5), 4.3 g/L of VFAs production was obtained, with 1.3 and 1.2 g/L of butyric and isovaleric acids, respectively, as the main intermediate metabolite. Around 3.8 g/L of butyric acid was produced in C6, with 0.1 g/L of acetic acid accumulated in the final operational period, resulting in the highest methane production (5.5 mmol/L). Isovaleric acid was the main intermediate metabolite produced in C7 (1.2 g/L) with 2.7 g/L of VFAs accumulated. Short-chain VFAs, such as valeric acid can be converted into acetate via acetogenesis and subsequently used as substrate for methane production (Gaby et al., 2017). Trace of second-generation ethanol was also produced in all the conditions and reached 61.6, 37.4, 20.9, 24.8, 54.8, 20.2, and 30.6 mg/L, in C1, C2, C3, C3, C4, C5,C6, andC7, respectively. In the fermentative process, this solvent has inhibitory effect on hydrogen production due to the competition for free electrons for H2 production (Chong et al., 2009), although it was also reported in smaller amount using bagasse hydrolysate in a separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) (Cheng and Chang, 2011)."
11,Microbial communities taxonomy and potential metabolite pathways,"3.3 Microbial communities taxonomy and potential metabolite pathways In order to analyze the microbial structure, a classification explanation was investigated by best hit classification at the cutoff E value 10−5. The Bacteria was the predominant domain (99.6, 99.7, and 85.2 %, in the experiments using laboratorial untreated SCB rind – C4, industrial HT pretreated SCB rind – C5, and pith C7, respectively). While Archaea domain was observed in relative abundance of 0.4, 0.3, and 14.8 %, in C4, C5, and C7, respectively (Fig. 4 ). To better understand the microbial community structure using different SCB conditions, taxonomic affiliation at different levels was analyzed. At the phylum level, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Synergistetespredominated in C4 (88.6, 5.7, 2.6, and 2.1 %, respectively) while, Synergistetes and Firmicuteswere the main phylum in C5 (74.4 and 25.2 % respectively). In C7, an Archaeal phylum (Euryarchaeota) was found in high relative abundance (14.8.0 %) in addition to Firmicutes (51.8.0 %) and Synergistetes (33.4 %). Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Synergistetes and Euryarchaeota were reported to be dominant phyla in anaerobic co-digestion of fats, oil and grease to enhance methane production (Kurade et al., 2019).Firmicutes, Bactereroides and Synergistetes were also described as predominant phyla involved in lignocellulosic degradation in cockroach gut (Bertino-Grimaldi et al., 2013), while Fusobacteria was associated to be a great contribution for petroleum degradation (Yu et al., 2018), indicating the important role of these phyla in the degradation of complex substrate. The top genera found (Fig. 5 ) in C4 were Thermoanaerobacterium (75.0 %), Lactococcus (6.3 %), Bacteroides (5.3 %), Acetomicrobium (2.1 %), and Fusobacterium (1.8 %), while the main genera in C5 was Acetomicrobium (74.4), Sporoanaerobacter (19. %), and Ruminiclostridium (5.7 %). In C7, Clostridium was the predominant genus (34.4 %) followed by Acetomicrobium (33.4 %), Methanoculleus (14.8 %), Sporanaerobacter(19.0 %), and Ruminiclostridium (5.7 %) Sugarcane was manually grinded for juice extraction in C4, laboratorial untreated SCB rind. In this procedure, SCB was generated with high hemicellulose content (31.9 %) and was impregnated by residual reduced sugars which were probably easily fermented, resulting in a decrease of pH (4.07). In this scenario, Thermoanaerobacterium was the main genus observed in C4 (75 %) which includes fermentative bacteria able to convert carbohydrates into hydrogen, VFA and ethanol (O-Thong et al., 2011).(Silva et al., 2018) reported hydrogen, organic acid and ethanol production from glucose, xylose and cellulose using a microbial consortium rich in Thermoanaerobacterium genus. In the same way, (Cao and Aita, 2013)was the first to state that this genus could be used as a sole bacteria for the concomitant cellulose degradation and hydrogen production due to its ability for cellulase and xylanase production. However, no hydrogen production was obtained in C4, indicating that this metabolic pathway was inhibited, and probably modified in order to produce organic acids and ethanol, probably as a response to the low pH (4.0) observed in this condition. Low pH affects the activity of (Fe-Fe) hydrogenase enzyme, and consequently hydrogen production (Kothari et al., 2017), which probably occurred in C4. Another reason for the inhibition on hydrogen production in this condition could be due to the high lactic acid produced in C4 (1.3 g/L), potentially by Lactococcus, which was the second higher genus found in this condition (6.3 %), once lactic acid bacteria (LAB) compete with hydrogen bacteria for the substrate. Additionally, LAB can produce bacteriocins, which are antimicrobial peptides able to kill or inhibit the growth of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Miao et al., 2014). It is important to highlight that LAB, such as Lactococcus, presents mechanisms for acid stress resistance such as glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) production (Kanwal et al., 2014; Su et al., 2011), resisting to acidic environments such as found in C4. In addition, the Bacteroidesgenus (5.3 %) was associated to cellulose degradation and dietary fibers fermentation (Xiong et al., 2019), generating formate, acetate, propionate, succinate, ethanol and lactic acid from food waste degradation (Chassard et al., 2005), therefore, potentially corroborating to the lactic acid production from SCB in C4. The hydrolytic and fermenting bacteria Fusobacteriumfound in C4 (1.8 %) was also involved on the insoluble biomass hydrolysis based on excretion of various enzymes, such as cellulases, cellobiases, xylanases, amylases, proteases, and lipases (Ozbayram et al., 2020). Higher pH (6.4) in C5 (industrial HT pretreated SCB rind) favored microorganisms and metabolic pathways involved in hydrogen production. Acetomicrobium, an obligatory anaerobic bacteria able to ferment sugars to acetate, CO2 and H2(Ben Hania et al., 2016),was the predominant genus in this condition (74.4 %). Acetate is the main intermediate metabolite produced by Acetomicrobium, and was produced in C5 (0.92 g/L), although the hydrogen production also occurred via butyric fermentation (1.3 g/L). In addition, in C5 the genera Sporanaerobacter(19 %) and Ruminiclostridium (5.7 %) were also observed. According to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (Kegg database) (Kanehisa et al., 2002), the Sporanaerobacter genus has an important role in the carbon, pentoses- phosphate metabolism and glycolysis, which performs the bioconversion of sugars into succinate, fumarate, acetate, formate and lactate production as well as the formate reforming that results in CO2 production. In agreement with the present study, Ruminiclostridium genus was associated to high volumetric hydrogen production rate and yields in a thermophilic reactor fed with hydrolysate of agave bagasse (Montiel-Corona et al., 2020). Microorganisms involved in all the AD steps were found in the reactor using industrial untreated SCB pith (C7). The predominant genus was Clostridium(34.4 %), in which all the Gram-positive, anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria are grouped. This genus possesses an extracellular multi-enzymatic complex, the cellulosome, involved in the cellulose bioconversion also performs the Embden-Meyerhof Parnas pathways for lactate, acetate, ethanol and hydrogen production (Desvaux, 2005). The acid-producing bacteria Acetomicrobium (33.4 %), Sporanaerobacter (7.8 %), and Ruminiclostridium (4.3 %), were also found in C5, performing the acidogenesis and acetogenesis step, resulting in higher hydrogen production in this condition in detriment to the high lactic acid production observed in C4. Finally, methanogenesis was performed mainly by the genus Methanoculleus, with relative abundance of 14.8 % was observed in C7,concluding the AD process of SCB.It is important to highlight that methane production performed by this genus is conducted via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway (Stolze et al., 2015), justifying the low hydrogen accumulation (4.5 mmol/L) in this condition."
12,Conclusion,"Using untreated laboratorial SCB rind, the available sugars in the fiber were quickly consumed causing a decrease in the pH and favoring the heterofermentative metabolism of lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactococcus, and consequent lactic acid accumulation. Whereas, the HT pretreatment of industrial SCB rind, partially disrupted the recalcitrant structures of the biomass, allowing an increase of the surface area and enhancing accessibility for the enzymatic attack, favoring hydrogen-producing bacteria like Acetomicrobium and Ruminiclostridium. Finally, hydrogen, volatile fatty acids, and methane were produced by microorganisms such as the genera Clostridium, Sporanaerobacter and Methanoculleus, respectively, from industrial untreated SCB pith."
