0,Introduction,"Investigations on clean and renewable energy alternatives are gaining increased attention over the years due to the fossil fuel crisis and environmental concerns [1,2]. Intensive scientific efforts have been placed into hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen combustion produces only water and generates the highest gravimetric heat (286 kJ mol−1) [3,4]. However, H2 gas faces some drawbacks such as safety, high costs, and complex operation regarding its storage [5]. Alternatively, direct hydrogen peroxide fuel cells (DHPFCs) have emerged as a means to convert chemical energy into electricity [6]. Besides its environmentally harmless oxidation, which produces only water and oxygen (2H2O2 ⟶ O2 + 2H2O), an H2O2 fuel cell allows safe storage and high energy density (117 kJ mol−1) [7]. Because H2O2 is used as a fuel in the anode and electron acceptor in the cathode and only one electrolyte is needed for the cell to operate, the use of a membrane to separate the anode from the cathode becomes unnecessary, thus simplifying the cell design [8]. One-compartment H2O2 fuel cells have been previously reported employing noble metals [9] or non-visible-light photoelectrodes [8,10–13]. Nonetheless, efficient one-compartment hydrogen peroxide photocatalytic fuel cells (HPPFCs) still need better and cheaper photoelectrodes to improve its performance and costs. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells are highlighted as promising clean technology to generate electricity or fuels [14,15]. PEC cells use semiconductor photoelectrodes and light to generate reactive holes and electrons, further promoting oxi-reduction reactions at the photoelectrode surface [16–26]. Being widely explored and improved in the last decade, BiVO4 is pointed out as one of the most promising photoanodes for application in PEC cells [27–32]. BiVO4 stands out for its visible-light absorption capacity, low-cost based on earth-abundant elements, and high current production [33–35]. Higher photocurrent densities for water oxidation have been demonstrated using V2O5 coupled W-doped BiVO4 photoanode [34]. BiVO4 doping with W improves electron conductivity, and V2O5 enhances hole transport and visible light absorption, thereby increasing photoelectrode efficiency [34,36–38]. Recently, one-compartment H2O2-photofuel cell using BiVO4 as a photoanode has reported positive progress towards HPPFCs development [39]. However, the power density obtained is low, showing that HPPFCs involving BiVO4 still needs to be further studied. A promising strategy to improve the efficiency of PEC devices is to couple a photoanode with a photocathode in a configuration where both electrodes absorb light, thus generating an electron-hole pair in each absorber. It has been shown that the absorption of photons is improved by placing one photoelectrode in front of the other (in tandem), where photons not absorbed by the first photoelectrode are transmitted and absorbed by the second photoelectrode [40]. Investigations regarding the combination of BiVO4 photoanode with a photocathode are promising but not well-explored approaches for HPPFCs. Even though it has been rarely studied for HPPFCs, CuO and Cu2O are the most popular photocathodes used in PEC cells due to its simple synthesis, low cost, and excellent visible light absorption [41,42]. In this work, we have developed a one-compartment HPPFC formed by a W-BiVO4/V2O5 photoanode and a Cu2O/CuO photocathode that operates in air-saturated NaHCO3/H2O2 aqueous solution at pH 8. In the HPPFC, the H2O2 was used as a fuel and electron acceptor to simplify the cell design. Finally, we compared the tandem cell formed by the W-BiVO4/V2O5 photoanode and Cu2O/CuO photocathode, with cells composed by W-BiVO4/V2O5 photoanode and Pt cathode or Cu2O/CuO photocathode and Pt anode, to evaluate the possibility of replacing the so far used PEC devices employing costly Pt electrodes."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of W-BiVO4 and V2O5 particles,"2.1 Synthesis of W-BiVO4 and V2O5 particles All chemicals used in semiconductor synthesis were analytical grade and without further purification. W-BiVO4 and V2O5 particles were synthesized following the procedure described by Oliveira et al. [34]. Briefly, one mmol (0.4850 g) Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and two mmol sodium dodecyl sulfate were dissolved in 10 mL of 4 M HNO3 solution (solution A). Solution B was prepared by dissolving 0.97 mmol (0.1135 g) NH4VO3 and 0.03 mmol (0.0099 g) Na2WO4.2H2O in 2 M NaOH solution. The two solutions were mixed, and the pH adjusted to seven. The suspension obtained was kept under stirring at 80 °C for 1 h. The yellow precipitate of W-BiVO4 was separated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min, washed with deionized water three times, one time with absolute alcohol, and dried at 100 °C for 24 h. V2O5 particles were synthesized by thermal decomposition of NH4VO3 at 600 °C for 6 h in dry air."
3,Photoanode preparation,"2.2 Photoanode preparation W-BiVO4 (2 mg) and V2O5 (2 mg) were dispersed in 400 μL isopropanol using an ultrasound bath for 1 h. Then, the W-BiVO4/V2O5 suspension was deposited over 1 cm2 of an FTO-coated glass conductive substrate (10 × 20 × 2 mm, 16 Ω cm−2) at 50 °C by drop-casting, adding 25 μL at a time until the entire suspension was used. Finally, the films were calcined at 500 °C for 2 h in dry air to form multiple W-BiVO4/V2O5 junctions."
4,Photocathode preparation,"2.3 Photocathode preparation Cu2O/CuO films were prepared using a Cu2O powder sample purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (CAS Number 1317-39-1). Eight milligrams of Cu2O were dispersed in 400 μL isopropanol under sonication for 1 h. Then, the Cu2O suspension was drop-coated onto 1 cm2 FTO substrate at 50 °C, adding 25 μL of the suspension at a time until complete deposition. Finally, the Cu2O film was calcined at 450 °C for 2 h in dry air to form Cu2O/CuO film."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The crystal structures of the films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction measurements using a diffractometer (XRD 6000, Shimadzu), with a scanning speed of 0.5 o/min, 40 kV, 200 mA, and Cu radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). Film morphology and thickness were determined by scanning electron microscopy images using a Philips® XL-30 FEG microscope. The electronic structure was evaluated by diffuse reflectance measurements using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV 2700). Barium sulfate was used as a reference for 100% transmission."
6,Photoelectrochemical tests,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical tests The performance of HPPFCs was monitored by voltammetry measurements using a potentiostat-galvanostat (AUTOLAB PGSTAT 128 N) in a configuration with two and three electrodes. For three-electrode measurements, Ag/AgCl (3.0 M KCl) was used as a reference electrode, a platinum plate as a counter electrode, and the W-BiVO4/V2O5 or Cu2O/CuO films as working electrodes. A Xe lamp was used as a light source (100 mA cm−2, λ > 385 nm). 1 M NaHCO3 (pH = 8) was the electrolyte. H2O2 (0–0.8 M) was used as both fuel and electron acceptor. All electrolytes were used without purging any inert gas in the solution or saturated with air to fix the H2O2/O2 redox potential. Electrochemical impedance measurements were performed with a potentiostat-galvanostat (AUTOLAB PGSTAT 128 N) equipped with the FRA32M module. Nyquist plots were taken at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl with an AC amplitude of 20 mV, frequency of 100 kHz-100 mHz under irradiation of a Xe lamp (100 mA cm−2, λ > 385 nm). Impedance data were fitted with NOVA 2.1 software. An air-saturated 1 M NaHCO3 solution was used as electrolyte and 0.1 M H2O2 as fuel and electron acceptor."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of photoelectrodes,"3.1 Characterization of photoelectrodes To build the HPPFC, we first constructed the photoanode and photocathode that work as light absorbers. X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 1a) indicated that the photoanode is composed of monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS card # 44–81, space group I2/a) and orthorhombic V2O5 (JCPDS card # 9–387, Pmmn). Tungsten produced no additional detectable lines, suggesting that no crystalline phase other than BiVO4 and V2O5 was formed in the photoanode. The photocathode is formed by monoclinic CuO (JCPDS card # 5–661, C2/c) and cubic Cu2O (JCPDS card # 5–667, Pn3m) (Fig. 1b). The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the photoanode and photocathode are shown in Fig. 1c,d. The W-BiVO4/V2O5 photoanode absorbed light from 200 to approximately 500 nm (Fig. 1c) and the Cu2O/CuO photocathode from 200 to 800 nm (Fig. 1d). Most of the light absorption by the Cu2O/CuO film is in the visible region (400–800 nm), thus complementing the W-BiVO4/V2O5 light absorption. Using the Tauc's Eq. [43], we determined that the direct bandgap energies of W-BiVO4/V2O5 photoanode (Fig. 1e) and Cu2O/CuO photocathode (Fig. 1f) were 2.49 eV and 1.55 eV, respectively. SEM images show quasi-spherical particles of pure W-BiVO4 (Fig. 2a) and rods of V2O5 (Fig. 2b). SEM image of W-BiVO4/V2O5 photoanode (Fig. 2c) clearly shows the agglomerated of quasi-spherical W-BiVO4 particles attached to V2O5 rods. The photocathode (Fig. 2d) is formed by an agglomerate of Cu2O/CuO particles of different sizes and irregular shapes. The thickness of the W-BiVO4/V2O5 film (Fig. 2e) was about five times smaller than that of Cu2O/CuO photocathode (Fig. 2f). It was found that 8 μm was the optimum photoanode thickness that allows maximum light absorption without negatively affecting the photocurrent (Fig. S1). Although W-BiVO4/V2O5 films are thick, high photocurrents can be obtained when the photoanode is illuminated from the FTO to the film (back-side illumination), since the path the electron has to travel to reach the conductive FTO is shorter than when the photoanode is illuminated from the film to the FTO (front-side illumination) [44]. Also, increasing the photoanode thickness greater than 8 μm resulted in a blockage of radiation reaching the photocathode, thereby decreasing the tandem photocell efficiency. Therefore, only these optimized photoelectrodes have been studied in more detail as photoanode and photocathode in HPPFCs. From the EDS spectrum (Fig. S2a), we determined that the photoanode is formed by 2.4 atom% W, 33.4 atom% V, and 24.3 atom% Bi. For the photocathode (Fig. S1b), we estimated 87.8 atom% Cu."
9,Photoelectrochemical tests,"3.2 Photoelectrochemical tests We then evaluated photoelectrode performance under Xe light irradiation in 1 M NaHCO3 electrolyte with and without additives. The J × V curves of W-BiVO4/V2O5 photoanode, Cu2O/CuO photocathode, and Pt cathode in NaHCO3, air-saturated NaHCO3, NaHCO3/H2O2, and air-saturated NaHCO3/H2O2 solutions at pH 8 are shown in Fig. 3 . In all cases, Pt was used as the counter-electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The obtained half-cell parameters such as short-circuit photocurrent (JSC), open- circuit potential (VOC), and half-cell efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 1 . Both Jsc and Voc of W-BiVO4/V2O5 photoanode increased with the saturation of NaHCO3 solution with air (Fig. 3a). Adding H2O2 to the electrolyte significantly increased the Jsc due to H2O2 oxidation (Eq. 1) but decreased the Voc of photoanode. The photoanode highest power density (0.53 mW cm−2) was obtained using NaHCO3 as electrolyte and H2O2 as fuel (Fig. 3b). (1) H 2 O 2 + 2 OH − ⟶ O 2 + 2 H 2 O + 2 e − To build a one-compartment HPPFCs, we tested the Cu2O/CuO photocathode under the same conditions as the photoanode (Fig. 3c, d). We observed that the Cu2O/CuO film produced positive photocurrents in NaHCO3 and air-saturated NaHCO3 electrolytes at the open-circuit potential. Following the addition of H2O2 to the NaHCO3 and air-saturated NaHCO3 electrolytes, the Cu2O/CuO photocathode produced photocurrent densities as high as −8.37 and − 9.75 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3c), respectively, indicating that H2O2 acts as an electron acceptor as shown in Eq. 2. The highest power density (0.63 mW cm−2) was produced by the Cu2O/CuO film in NaHCO3/H2O2. Subsequently, we compared the photoelectrochemical performance of Cu2O/CuO photocathode with a Pt cathode (Fig. Se, f). In both cases, Pt was used as the anode. In NaHCO3 and air-saturated NaHCO3, the JSC of the Pt cathode was negligible compared to those obtained in NaHCO3/H2O2 and NaHCO3/air/H2O2 (Table 1), which showed a power density of 0.67 and 0.61 mW cm−2, respectively. The Jsc and Voc of the Cu2O/CuO photocathode were higher than those of Pt cathode. The power density of Pt and Cu2O/CuO cathodes were similar. These results are attractive because it enables the Pt cathode to be replaced by a photocathode consisting of metals more abundant in the earth's crust. (2) H 2 O 2 + 2 e − ⟶ 2 OH −"
10,Charge transfer mechanism on photoelectrodes,"3.3 Charge transfer mechanism on photoelectrodes Mott-Schottky plots of the photoanode and photocathode are shown in Fig. S3. The positive slope of the straight line (Fig. S3a) confirms that the W-BiVO4/V2O5 film is n-type and the negative slope of the straight line in Fig. S3b indicates a p-type behavior of the Cu2O/CuO film. To determine each semiconductor energy band diagram, we first collected impedance spectra of pure W-BiVO4, V2O5, CuO, and Cu2O in air-saturated 1 M NaHCO3/0.2 M H2O2 at pH 8. From the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. S4), we determined the flatband potential [45] of pure W-BiVO4, V2O5, CuO, and Cu2O as being 0.15, 0.93, 1.24, and 1.14 V vs. RHE, respectively. Since the flatband potential is approximately the conduction band (CB) energy level of n-type semiconductors and the valence band (VB) energy level for the p-type semiconductors, we used the optical bandgap energy and flatband potential to determine the energy band structure of each semiconductor. The bandgap energy of pure W-BiVO4, V2O5, CuO, and Cu2O is 2.5 [34], 2.1 [34], 1.6 [46], and 2.0 eV [46], respectively. Thus, the valence band energy level of W-BiVO4 and V2O5 is the sum of bandgap energy and flatband potential (EVB = Eg + Vfb) [47]. On the other hand, the conduction band energy level of CuO and Cu2O is the difference between the flatband potential and the bandgap energy of those semiconductors (ECB = Vfb - Eg) [47]. Thus, we build the semiconductor band energy diagram shown in Fig. 4 . The redox potentials indicated in Fig. 4 were calculated by considering that those reactions follow the Nernst equation. At pH 0, the O2/H2O and H+/H2 reduction potentials are 1.23 V and 0 V [48], respectively. To obtain the potentials at pH 8, we use the expression: E(final pH) = E(initial pH) - 0.059(final pH - initial pH). Thus, at pH 8 the potentials of the O2/−OH and H2O/H2 pairs are 0.76 V and − 0.47 V, respectively. At pH 3, the O2/H2O2 and H2O2/H2O reduction potentials are 0.518 V and 1.586 V [39], respectively. Thus, at pH 8 the redox potentials of the O2/H2O2 and H2O2/−OH pairs are 0.22 V and 1.29 V, respectively. Type-II band alignment of W-BiVO4/V2O5 and Cu2O/CuO heterostructures favors the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. In the photoanode (Fig. 4a), the photogenerated electrons in the W-BiVO4 CB are transferred to the V2O5 CB, and the photogenerated holes in the V2O5 VB migrate to the W-BiVO4 VB. In the photocathode (Fig. 4b), electrons in the Cu2O CB are injected into the CuO CB, and the holes in the CuO VB are transferred to the Cu2O VB. Thus, the photogenerated holes migrate to the photoanode surface to perform oxidation reactions, and the photogenerated electrons in the photocathode migrate to the surface to promote the reduction reactions. In a tandem cell, the photogenerated electrons in the photoanode recombine with the photogenerated holes in the photocathode. The VB energy levels of both W-BiVO4 and V2O5 are more positive than the O2/H2O2 and O2/−OH redox potentials, indicating that oxidation of H2O2 and −OH by the W-BiVO4/V2O5 photoanode is thermodynamically favorable. We found that the JSC obtained in H2O2 was significantly higher than that in its absence, suggesting that the oxidation kinetics of H2O2 is faster than that of −OH. Therefore, the W-BiVO4/V2O5 photoanode power density was higher when H2O2 was used as an electron donor (fuel). Similarly, electrons in the CB of Cu2O/CuO photocathode have enough energy to reduce H2O and H2O2. Nevertheless, we identified that under short-circuit conditions, the Cu2O/CuO photocathode produced no H2, requiring overpotential for the reaction to occur due to the slow reaction kinetics. On the other hand, the rapid kinetics of H2O2 reduction by Cu2O/CuO photocathode resulted in a high JSC (Table 1), indicating that H2O2 acts as an excellent electron acceptor from the Cu2O/CuO photocathode."
11,H2O2 photocatalytic fuel cells,"3.4 H2O2 photocatalytic fuel cells From the intersection of J × V curves for the photocathode and photoanode, we estimated the optimal operating current density (Jop) for cells in different electrolytes (Fig. 5 ). The Jop of W-BiVO4/V2O5 and Cu2O/CuO photocell (PA-PC) was higher than that of W-BiVO4/V2O5 and Pt (PA-Pt) photocell in all studied solutions. In NaHCO3 (Fig. 5a), the PA-PC photocell produced a Jop of 2.17 mA cm−2 against the PA-Pt photocell 1.02 mA cm−2. In NaHCO3/air (Fig. 5b), the Jop decreased in both photocells, but the operating voltage has increased. In NaHCO3/H2O2 and NaHCO3/air/H2O2 (Fig. 5c, d), the Jop significantly increased to 7.94 and 7.76 mA cm−2 in the PA-PC photocell and 6.84 and 6.71 mA cm−2 in PA-Pt, respectively. In both photocells, the operating voltage was higher in the air-saturated NaHCO3 electrolyte, resulting in higher power density cells. Therefore, we further built one-compartment PA-PC and PA-Pt photocells that operate in air-saturated NaHCO3 electrolyte and using H2O2 as both fuel and electron acceptor. Four configurations have been set up for tandem HPPFCs as follows: (i) PC-PA, (ii) PC-Pt, (iii) PA-Pt, and (iv) PA-PC (Fig. 6a-d). The working electrode has been connected to the cathode or photocathode and the counter-electrode has been connected to the photoanode. The parallel beam of light is focused on the surface of the vertically submerged films in the electrolyte. In the PC-PA photocell, both photocathode (PC) and photoanode (PA) absorb light. In this configuration, the light goes first to the PC and then to the PA. In PC-Pt and PA-Pt cells, only the photocathode or photoanode absorbs light, respectively. In the PA- PC photocell light first passes through the W-BiVO4/V2O5 film and finally through the Cu2O/CuO film. Under illumination, the PA-PC photocell exhibited the largest Voc of 0.41 V (Fig. 6a, Table 2 ). When light first passes through the Cu2O/CuO film in the PC-PA photocell, its efficiency has been dramatically decreased because Cu2O/CuO film absorbs most of the incident light due to its smaller bandgap energy and thus blocks some of the radiation that is used to activate the W-BiVO4/V2O5 film. The highest Jsc of 8.50 mA cm−2 was obtained with the PA-Pt photocell. The photocell fill factors ranged from 0.24 to 0.40 (Table 2). The highest power density (0.84 mW cm−2, Fig. 6b) was obtained with the PA-PC photocell because both photoanode and photocathode were activated by light to generate the cell electromotive force."
12,Effect of H2O2 concentration,"3.5 Effect of H2O2 concentration Since the PA-PC photocell exhibited the highest efficiency, we evaluated the effect of H2O2 concentration on their short-circuit current density, open-circuit potential, and fill factor (Fig. 7 ). The JSC increased strongly from 0.6 mA cm−2 in 0 M H2O2 to 7.55 mA cm−2 at 0.2 M H2O2 (Fig. 7a). H2O2 concentrations greater than 0.1 M only increased the JSC to 7.99 mA cm−2 in 0.8 M H2O2. The VOC of photocell increased from 0.37 V in 0 M H2O2 to 0.46 V at 0.1 M H2O2. From this concentration, an increase in H2O2 concentration caused a decrease in Voc, achieving 0.32 V in 0.8 M H2O2. The photocell fill factor decreased from 0.31 in 0 M H2O2 to 0.23 in 0.05 M H2O2 (Fig. 7b). Increasing the H2O2 concentration to 0.1 M caused an increase in the photocell fill factor to 0.26, which peaked at 0.28 in 0.8 M H2O2. The highest photocell power density (0.85 mW cm−2) was obtained at 0.1 M H2O2 (Fig. 7b). Increasing the concentration above 0.1 M H2O2 caused a decrease in power density. Thus, we determined that the optimal H2O2 concentration for photocell operation was 0.1 M."
13,"Electrochemical impedance, chronoamperometry, and chronopotentiometry measurements","3.6 Electrochemical impedance, chronoamperometry, and chronopotentiometry measurements The charge transfer kinetics on the photoelectrode surface were studied by electrochemical impedance measurements in air-saturated 1 M NaHCO3 and 0.1 M H2O2 in a two-electrode cell configuration. Nyquist plots (Fig. 8a) showed that photoelectrode illumination plays an essential role in the oxidation and reduction of H2O2 since the charge transfer resistance in the dark (Rct = 161,000 Ω) was significantly higher than that obtained under illumination. (241 Ω). Chronoamperometry measurements in the dark and under illumination at 0 V vs. Cu2O/CuO are shown in Fig. 8b. The photocurrent density was significantly higher under illumination than in the dark, confirming that the electrochemical cell is indeed a photoassisted fuel cell. Cell photovoltage (Fig. 8c) was also estimated by chronopotentiometry measurements in the dark and under light irradiation. The difference between the OCP in the dark and under illumination gave an output photovoltage of 0.41 V."
14,Comparison with the state of the art,"3.7 Comparison with the state of the art In previous works, HPPFCs have been fabricated using a photoanode and a dark cathode. TiO2 and Prussian blue or glassy carbon are the most used light absorber and cathode in HPPFCs, respectively (Table 3 ). The disadvantage of those HPPFCs is that TiO2 absorbs only UV light, limiting the absorption of sunlight. The JSC of those TiO2 photocells under UV light irradiation ranged from 0.197 to 1.57 mA cm−2 and the VOC from 0.595 to 0.787 V. The power density of TiO2 photocells is less than 0.1 mW cm−2. Recently, Onishi et al. [39] reported an HPPFC using a BiVO4 photoanode that can be activated with visible light. However, the JSC (0.81 mA cm−2) and power density (0.13 mW cm−2) of those cells remained low. Despite the direct comparison between the HPPFC shown in this work and the different HPPFCs reported in the state of the art cannot be performed due to the different electrolytes and light sources used, we can see that significant advances can be obtained by building tandem HPPFCs."
15,Conclusion,"A photoassisted H2O2 fuel cell was constructed using a W-BiVO4/V2O5 photoanode and Cu2O/CuO photocathode illuminated in tandem. In this one-compartment photocell, H2O2 was both a fuel (electron donor) and an electron acceptor. This setting is attractive because it simplifies the photocell design since membranes to separate the photoanode from the photocathode was unnecessary. Under simulated sunlight, the dual-photoelectrode cell produced a short-circuit photocurrent density of 8.05 mA cm−2, 0.41 V open-circuit potential, a fill factor of 0.24, and a power density of 0.84 mW cm−2 in air-saturated 1 M NaHCO3/0.1 M H2O2 (pH 8) aqueous solution, which was significantly higher than the power densities obtained with photocells formed by a single absorber (photoanode or photocathode) and Pt counter-electrode. The data obtained indicated that a Cu2O/CuO photocathode could replace the expensive Pt cathode, resulting in more efficient H2O2 photocells."
