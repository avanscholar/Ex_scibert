0,Introduction,"Benzaldehyde (BzH) is an important chemical intermediate used in a variety of fields. Production of BzH traditionally includes hydrolysis of benzyl chloride and oxidation of toluene. However, the hydrolysis of benzyl chloride often results in a trace amount of chlorine in the product, which greatly limits the application of BzH in the manufacture of odorants, flavors, and pharmaceutical intermediates. As for the oxidation method, the selectivity for BzH is relatively low. In order to develop chlorine-free BzH, selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH) to BzH has been investigated [1–4]. Polyoxometalates (POMs) as catalysts have demonstrated high activity in the oxidation of BzOH using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the oxidant [5–8]. However, the difficulty in controlling the reaction's oxidative degree due to the super oxidation properties of hydrogen peroxide leads to the inevitable generation of benzoic acid as a by-product. Furthermore, unmodified POM has several disadvantages, such as poor solubility, low selectivity, difficulty in recovery, and poor stability. To improve its catalytic performance and recovery efficiency, POM was modified by organic molecules to produce different structures and functions [9,10]. Because of POM's multi-electron structure, it can be modified by ion-exchange electrostatic interactions [11–13]. Cationic surfactants are common positive charge-substituted molecules and can easily be introduced into POM to generate a surfactant-POM with an amphipathic molecular structure [14–16]. However, these POM hybrid materials still exhibit some drawbacks, including low BET specific surface area and small pore diameter of the catalysts. Both of these factors result in insufficient contact between catalysts and reactants, reducing the catalytic efficiency. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new strategies to design POM hybrid catalysts with a high BET specific surface area, large pore diameter, and high recyclability. Here in, a new surfactant containing coumarin functional groups was synthesized and introduced into H4PMo11VO40 with a Keggin structure. Two catalysts (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 and (Coumarin)4PMo11VO40) were synthesized and their catalytic ability in the oxidation of BzOH was investigated. The results indicate that (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 exhibits better catalytic performance of the two, and the effects of the solvent, the amount of catalyst, reaction temperature, and oxidant on the reaction were studied. The catalyst is well dispersed in DMSO while being automatically separated by UV light (365 nm) after reaction due to photodimerization between the coumarin-surfactants. This study provides a new perspective for the preparation of POM hybrid materials with a large specific surface area, an appropriate pore size, and which features homogeneous catalytic and heterogeneous separation using surfactants containing functional groups through the electrostatic effect. Furthermore, the oxidation of BzOH using air as the oxidant offers practical industrial significance."
1,Experimental,"The preparation process of the catalyst is shown in Scheme. 1 , taking (Coumarin)4PMo11VO40 as an example and other details of synthesis and characterization of the materials are shown in Supporting Information (SI). The adsorption kinetics of BzOH in the catalysts was carried by literature [14]."
2,Results and discussion,"As shown in Fig. 1 , the characteristic vibrational spectrum of H4PMo11VO40 features peaks at 1063 cm−1 (ν as P-Oa), 962 cm−1 (ν as P=Od), 867 cm−1 (ν as Mo-Ob-Mo), and 785 cm−1 (ν as Mo-Oc-Mo). The peaks at 1729, 1609, 1471, 1058, 946, and 788 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectrum can be assigned to the coumarin-surfactant. The characteristic absorption peaks of the coumarin-surfactant and POM are shown in both absorption curves of (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 and (Coumarin)4PMo11VO40. It can be seen that the absorption peaks of the two catalysts have shifted from that of pure POM, due to the strong ionic interactions between the cationic surfactant and PMo11VO40 4−. As shown in Fig. S1, the largest difference in the 1H NMR spectra between the coumarin-surfactant and coumarin-POM (both (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 and (Coumarin)4PMo11VO40) is the resonance signals of N-CH3. This is similar to that observed in the FT-IR results, where the chemical shift of the hydrogen protons of N-CH3 on coumarin-POM are shifted from the coumarin-surfactant due to electrostatic effects. These changes indicate that the modified catalyst maintains the POM's Keggin structure and there is a strong electrostatic force between the surfactant and the POM. The FT-IR and NMR results can preliminarily confirm that the coumarin-surfactant has been introduced to the POM; however, it is necessary to investigate the specific number of surfactants by thermal analysis. The TGA results (Fig. S2) show that the mass loss of (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 and (Coumarin)4PMo11VO40 is 41.2% and 35.2% (in w/w) before 750 °C, which are in accordance with the theoretical calculations (41.6% and 35.6%). Combined with the elemental analysis results (Table 1), the predicated chemical formulas of the two catalysts are further confirmed. In the selective oxidation of BzOH to BzH, the main side reaction is the overoxidation of BzH to benzoic acid. As shown in Table 1 , the catalytic efficiency of (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 is higher than (Coumarin)4PMo11VO40. Both catalysts exhibit a larger BET specific surface area than pure H4PMo11VO40 and the same POM hybrid material, as reported in the literature [14] (i.e., (DDA)4PMo11VO40 (1.25), (HDA)4PMo11VO40 (1.12), (ODA)4PMo11VO40 (0.82), and (DODA)4PMo11VO40 (0.68)). This is because organic small molecules with flexible chains can easily enter the channels of H4PMo11VO40. The rigid structure of the coumarin-surfactant does not enable easy access to the H4PMo11VO40 channel-like structure; therefore, these surfactants form a net-like trap configuration, thereby increasing the specific surface area of the catalyst and allowing the capture of the BzOH reaction material. However, (Coumarin)4PMo11VO40 exhibits a small pore diameter (10.36), much less than that of (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 and H4PMo11VO40. This small diameter size is not conducive to the timely diffusion of the reactants, reducing the catalytic effect. The small pore size may result from strong intermolecular forces and π-π*conjugate effects between coumarin molecules. Unlike (Coumarin)4PMo11VO40, (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 possesses a structural defect, which reduces the intermolecular forces between the courmarin-surfactant. Fig. S3 shows the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of sample containing H4PMo11VO40 and coumarin-surfactant, ranging from −0.2 to +1.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl), in 0.1 mol L−1 phosphate-buffered saline at 100 mV s−1 scan rate. Three pairs of redox peaks of initial H4PMo11VO40 are detected, with the peak potentials E1/2 = −0.091, 0.211, and 0.515 mV, (E1/2 = (Epc + Epa)/2) [17]. The redox reaction occurs easily on the electrode surface, because that the initial H4PMo11VO40 was soluble. As shown in Fig. S(3b), the three pairs of redox peaks decreased gradually when the coumarin-surfactant was incorporated onto H4PMo11VO40. This implicates that the solubility of the compound declined. The H4PMo11VO40 possesses four negative electrons. When all of the four electrons were occupied by four coumarin-surfactants, the three pairs of peaks on CVs would drop significantly, because that the surface of H4PMo11VO40 was surrounded by organic molecules (Fig. S(3c)). Since the outside of this compound contained more coumarin-surfactants, it became more difficult for redox reaction to take place at the surface of electrode. The size changing of compound also complies with the finding from CVs results. This further demonstrates the reason why the catalytic performance of (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 is better than (Coumarin)4PMo11VO40. As shown in Fig. S4–6 the SEM images reveal that the coumarin-surfactant modified H4PMo11VO40 retain the structure comparing to the pure H4PMo11VO40, but the particle size of a modified H4PMo11VO40 is larger than the pure H4PMo11VO40. To investigate the effect between the reactant and catalysts, the adsorption kinetics of BzOH in the catalysts were studied. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), (Coumarin)4PMo11VO40 can adsorb more BzOH than (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40. More BzOH can be adsorbed on the catalyst surface because it contains additional coumarin-surfactant. As shown in Fig. 2 (b), this is a result of strong π-π*conjugate effects between BzOH and (Coumarin)4PMo11VO40, compared to that in (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40. Further, the hydrophobic surfactant works to enrich the polar BeOH, which is conducive for BzH loss. Therefore, it is understood that the modified catalyst (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 offers better catalysis effects than pure H4PMo11VO40 because it possesses a relatively large BET specific surface area and an adsorptive effect with the reactants. However, BzOH cannot be dispersed in time and the catalytic efficiency is reduced due to the smaller pore size of (Coumarin)4PMo11VO40. The influence of the solvent on the oxidation of BzOH to BzH in the presence of (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 was also investigated. As shown in Fig. S7, benzyl alcohol conversion is affected by the polarity of the solvent, and the conversion rate increases with an increase in solvent polarity. The catalyst can be well dispersed in a solvent of large polarity. This is indicated by the results in Table S1, where the catalyst is fully dispersed in DMF and DMSO, but not as much in slightly polar solvents such as DCM and toluene. The catalyst demonstrated the highest catalytic effect in DMSO, so DMSO was selected as the reaction solvent. Following this, the influence of reaction time, reaction temperature, and the amount of catalyst on the oxidation of BzOH to BzH in the presence of (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 with O2 were investigated. Fig. S8 displays the optimum reaction conditions: reaction time of 90 min, reaction temperature of 150 °C, and amount of catalyst, 0.5 μmol. It was also discovered that under the optimal reaction conditions, when the oxidant was changed from oxygen to air, the reaction time reached 100 min, and the conversion of BzOH achieved 99% and the selectivity of BzH 100%. Benzoic acid was not detected in any of the experiments. Therefore, it is understood that BzH is not over-oxidized to benzoic acid under mild oxidant conditions. To demonstrate this phenomenon, hydrogen peroxide was used as an oxidant, and benzoic acid was produced under the same conditions (Table S2). The experimental results further indicate that when the coumarin-surfactant acts as the surfactant, BzOH's reactivity diminishes. Similarly, under anaerobic conditions, the conversion of BzOH is 0, which indicates that oxygen is the oxidant of the reaction. The reaction product obtained under the optimized reaction conditions (in the presence of (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 with air as the oxidant) was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), (Fig. S9 and S10). The results show that BzOH is completely oxidized to BzH, without any benzoic acid byproduct."
3,Conclusion,"Polyoxometalate-based catalysts ((Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 and (Coumarin)4PMo11VO40) were prepared by modifying V-containing Keggin H4PMo11VO40 with a coumarin-surfactant through electrostatic interactions. The catalysts were characterized by FT-IR, NMR, TG, SEM, and BET. The results indicate that a stable structure of the catalysts can be formed and prepared with a large specific surface area. In particular, (Coumarin)3HPMo11VO40 exhibits excellent catalytic activity in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol using air as the oxidant. The benzyl alcohol conversion exceeds 99% and the selectivity for benzaldehyde is 100%. The excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to π-π* conjugate effects with the reactant, as well as the large specific surface area and pore size of the catalyst."
