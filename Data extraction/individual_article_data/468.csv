0,Introduction,"The combustion of fossil fuels is the main cause of the greenhouse effect. The great concern has been expressed about improving energy efficiency, optimizing energy structure, developing alternative energy sources and minimizing CO2 emissions (Lin et al., 2014; Bui et al., 2018). Hydrogen (H2) is an important clean energy with the advantages of low carbon and high energy density, which is deemed as one of the preferred directions to solve the energy shortage problem in the future (IEA, 2020). H2 is also an important chemical industrial material in various processes. For example, it is widely used in the synthesis of ammonia, methanol industry, petroleum upgrade, reduction of iron ore and food industry, etc (Chehade and Dincer, 2021; Ji et al., 2020). In addition, H2 has broad prospects in the fields of fuel cells and new energy vehicles in the 21st century. Low-carbon H2 production technology has become a hot topic with the new global target of carbon neutral proposed (Nazir et al., 2020). H2 is available in different processes, such as reforming of organic matter, water photolysis (Saravanan et al., 2018) and water electrolysis (Molnarne and Schroeder, 2019). The catalytic reforming of natural gas and coal gasification are the mainstream methods (> 99%) for industrial H2 production at present (Yan et al., 2020; Fatigati et al., 2021). In addition, a promising possibility is to utilize renewable energy resources as candidates for green H2 production, such as biogas (Phromprasit et al., 2017, 2016) and bio-oil (Udomchoke et al., 2016). Generally, the conversion from carbonaceous fuels to syngas is the first step in the commercial H2 production technologies, followed by the water gas shift (WGS). The shifted syngas (mainly H2 and CO2) is obtained. Relevant reactions are listed in Table 1. Hydrogen and impurities can be further separated through purification methods. CO2 separation from the H2 is an important part in the above-mentioned processes, especially when high standard is considered for H2 purity in the application, e.g. fuel cell (Hansen, 2020). The separation techniques at the end of H2 production including pressure swing adsorption (PSA) (Bang et al., 2021) and membrane separation (Zhao et al., 2021) are energy-consuming, complex and with low adsorption rate. Therefore, novel researches on enhanced H2 production with in-situ CO2 capture has gained global interest (Ji et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020a). According to the equilibrium of chemical reaction, if the CO2 generated can be absorbed on the spot, the thermodynamic limit will be broken, shifting the reactions towards the product side, as shown in Eq. (5). Therefore, the final H2 yield increases and the overall energy conversion rate improves. This concept is known as the sorption-enhanced reaction process (SERP) for low-carbon H2 production. The crucial property of SERP is removing CO2 in the reactor for the continuous reaction. Ca-based sorbents possess high CO2 uptake and sufficient reaction efficiency, which have attracted extensive attention from researchers. The cyclic CO2 capture by Ca-based sorbents is defined as the calcium looping (CaL), which mainly compromises two steps. CO2 is absorbed by CaO, and the resulting CaCO3 releases CO2 in a separate calcination stage for storage or utilization, as shown in Eq. (6). The oxy-fuel combustion is suggested to provide the heat required for calcination with an enriched CO2 concentration higher than 96%. A coupling process of SERP and CaL is implemented in two main reactors, a reformer and a calciner, as shown in Fig. 1. (6) C a O + C O 2 = C a C O 3 Δ H = - 179 k J / m o l On the basis of traditional reforming process for H2 production, simultaneous reactions of steam reforming, WGS and CO2 capture proceed in the reformer during SEPR. This system leads to the reduced reactor or catalyst consumption for the industrial application. It is worth noting that reactions described in Eqs. (5) and (6) are exothermic. Integrating different reaction processes is an efficient way to further utilize heat, avoid energy loss and thus save the external heat input in the reformer theoretically to obtain high-purity H2. In addition, advantages including abundant reserves, wide distribution and low price of CaO sources such as limestone meet the demand for the economic operation of SERP. SERP with Ca-based sorbents achieves multiple goals of high efficiency, environmentally friendly and industrial cost saving, which makes it one of the hotspots of future research (Lee et al., 2020; Antzaras et al., 2020a). Designs of Ca-based sorbents applied in H2 production continue to evolve with the improved efficiency of SERP. The fundamental understanding about the effect of Ca-based sorbents on H2 production has also been discussed in detail. In this paper, the main characteristics and enhanced H2 production performance of various Ca-based materials for in-situ CO2 separation are reviewed. The most recent research progress of preparation methods for highly active Ca-based sorbents is presented. The effects of operation conditions (e.g. reaction temperature, pressure, steam, flow rate of feed and particle size) on reactivity of Ca-based sorbents, H2 yield and tar formation are summarized and compared. In addition, this work also covers studies which invoke Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations to gain better insight into these reaction processes and allow optimization of material synthesis."
1,Experimental works on Ca-based sorbents in SERP,
2,Positive effect of Ca-based sorbents on H2 production,"2.1 Positive effect of Ca-based sorbents on H2 production The complete SERP with Ca-based sorbents is generally divided into three successive processes including pre-breakthrough, breakthrough and post-breakthrough, as shown in Fig. 2. Fresh Ca-based sorbents provide timely in-situ CO2 sorption in the early stage, which occurs simultaneously with steam reforming and WGS reactions. The shifted equilibrium results in a higher and stable H2 concentration in the product gas than the process without sorbents. As the reaction proceeds, the CO2 capture process shifts from a chemical reaction-controlled stage to a diffusion-controlled stage (Scaltsoyiannes et al., 2021). The CO2 concentration increases with the intensifying kinetic restriction. Once Ca-based sorbents reach saturation, the process intensification of H2 production ends. In this case, the concentrations of H2 and CO2 are in accordance with the standard steam reforming process. Therefore, SERP is preferably carried out in the pre-breakthrough stage where CO2 can be removed timely and the H2 concentration maintains at a high level. Catalysts are often necessary to improve the reactant conversion and H2 yield. Typical catalysts include noble (Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd or Ir) and non-noble (Ni, Co, Fe or Cu) metals (Liu et al., 2021; Di Giuliano et al., 2021). The main side effect of reforming reactions is the formation of carbonaceous phases, which mainly spoils catalysts and causes plugging and over-heating problems (Fernandez et al., 2021). As for SERP, tar species also deposit on active sites of CaO surfaces, inhibiting CO2 absorption. Micheli et al. (2017) detected high quantity of amorphous carbon around the crystalline gains of NiO and CaO after 4 cycles of sorption-enhanced SMR/regeneration, as presented in Fig. 3. Sang et al. (2020) proposed the carbon formation pathway on the Ni/CaO surface during the reforming process of ethanol, as shown in Fig. 4. CH3CHO was formed first from the dehydrogenated of ethanol, which divided into HCO* and CHx*. The CHx* species were hydrogenated to form CH4 or converted to coke on the surface of Ni/CaO. The current feasible method for tar reduction is optimizing the operation parameter with elevated steam/carbon ratio (Sharma et al., 2017). However, this inevitably brings about a high energy cost. Another factor that could influence tar formation is the presence of CaO. It was found that CaO could activate catalyst surface with enriched electronic phase, which accelerated the dissociation of coke precursors and thus elimination of tar (Choong et al., 2011). Xia et al. (2020) concluded from the experimental work that NiO was firstly reduced by CO released from the gasification of rice husk to Ni, accompanied by a side product of CO2. CO2 was in-situ removal by CaO to form CaCO3. These coupled reactions significantly enhanced the generation rate of Ni as the catalytic site and thus avoided catalyst deactivation. The experiment of Nam et al. (2020) showed that the usage of CaO/Al2O3 as bed materials decreased the amount of gasification tar to approximately 5.8 g tar/kg biomass, the value about 43% lower than that during the conventional gasification. A good Ca-based sorbent should have high CO2 capture capacity (gas quantity absorbed per unit mass of sorbents) and coking resistance. Since the regeneration of sorbents (reversible reaction of Eq. (6)) typically requires high operating temperatures, it is essential to improve thermal stability of both sorbents and catalysts. Hence, suitable Ca-based sorbents have been explored in this field."
3,Ca-based sorbents from different sources,"2.2 Ca-based sorbents from different sources 2.2.1 CO2 capture performance of Ca-based sorbents Limestone as a mineralized form of CaO has been largely studied for CO2 capture because of its accessibility in nature. The experimental results from González et al. (2020) showed that the carbonation conversion of limestone-derived CaO was higher than 95%, where the carbonation was performed at 650 °C in 15%CO2/N2. Grasa and Abanades (2006) tested different types of limestones and compared the CaO conversions, as shown in Fig. 5. It can be found that small difference existed in the cyclic performance and the deactivation among them were similar. Dolomite (CaMg(CO3)3) is another mineral resource of CaO, which has been proved to possess more stable CO2 capture performance than limestone (Su et al., 2019). This is partly because the pores formed during the calcination of MgCO3 are conducive to the effective diffusion of gas through sorbents. Besides, the much higher Tamman temperature of MgO (1154 °C) compared with CaO weakens sintering and thus stabilizes the morphology of particles. This phenomenon has been known as the main reason for the limitation of sorption capacity decay. Tao et al. (2021) used an electrochemical method to study CO2 absorption characteristics of three minerals including calcite, dolomite, and magnesite. Experimental results proved that dolomite had shorter absorption time and larger absorption capacity at different temperatures. Large amounts of Ca-based wastes such as carbide slag (Yang et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019), steel slag (Zhao et al., 2019), white mud (Sun et al., 2021), blast furnace slag (Liu et al., 2021) and wasted marble (Nawar et al., 2019) are produced as by-products in different industries. Their major chemical components are calcium compounds, implying that these industrial wastes are good candidates for CO2 sorbents. The novel technique combining re-utilization of Ca-based industrial wastes and CO2 capture is promising from the point of view of environmental protection and cost reduction (Yang et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019; Papalas et al., 2020; Yasipourtehrani et al., 2020). Li et al. (2017) reviewed CO2 capture capacities of four types of Ca-based wastes, which showed higher values after 30 calcination/carbonation cycles than that of limestone. 2.2.2 Performance of Ca-based sorbents in SERP With regard to SERP, it should be noticed that the reaction conditions are different with CaL for CO2 capture, such as the presence of high-concentration steam and relatively low temperature in the reformer. Thus, studies have been done to investigate the application of Ca-based sorbents with different sources in SERP and compare their performance in H2 production. Fuchs et al. (2019) proved that limestone as bed material motivated the reforming of biomass in the gasification reactor and therefore H2 contents in the product gas up to 75 vol% was gained.Ebneyamini et al. (2020) provided a steady-state simulation on the integrated reaction of SMR and CO2 capture by limestone. Increasing limestone feed resulted in a higher H2 yield, attributable to the higher CH4 conversion with an upper limit of SERP thermodynamic equilibrium. Capa et al. (2020) tested a mixing of Pd/Ni-Co and dolomite in the sorption enhanced steam reforming of biogas. The H2 purity and H2 yield reached to 98 vol% and 91%, respectively. A further finding was that sulfur release in the commercial dolomite may result in catalyst poisoning. With the sulfur removal by the pretreatment of dolomite, the H2 concentrations during both the pre-breakthrough and post-breakthrough periods were equal to the respective equilibrium concentrations (Lopez Ortiz and Harrison, 2001). Acha et al. (2020) employed dolomites as the CO2 acceptor for SERP of a complex mixture including acetic acid, acetone, phenol, etc. H2 with purity about 99.9% was generated without CO or CH4 detection. Specially, Valle et al. (2019) and Valle et al. (2020) pointed out that impurities of Fe2O3 in dolomite could catalyst the sorption-enhanced gasification of biomass and steam reforming of bio-oil for tar reduction. Therefore, dolomite had both adsorptive and catalytic ability. Zhang et al. (2020) used acetic acid-pretreated steel slag in the steam reforming of coke oven gas and a CH4 conversion of 91.3% was achieved at 600 °C, which was mainly ascribed to the presence of MgO and Fe2O3. They also found that CaO derived from steel slag exhibited good catalytic activity during tar steam reforming tests with a conversion of 94.1% at 800 °C in another research published elsewhere (Guo et al., 2019). Wang et al. (2021) reported an experimental assessment on carbide slag catalytic effect of coal steam gasification process. The results showed that carbide slag effectively catalyzed gasification and enhanced H2 production due to the formation of calcium-oxygen-carbon complex, which could hinder the graphitization process of char."
4,Deactivation mechanism of Ca-based sorbents and the influence on SERP,"2.3 Deactivation mechanism of Ca-based sorbents and the influence on SERP Quantities of models have been conceived to describe the CO2 absorption behavior by Ca-based sorbents in kinetics. The well-known working principle of the evolution versus time is shown in Fig. 6. When Ca-based sorbents are exposed to a gaseous mixture containing CO2, CaO on the top layer can preferentially react with CO2, developing a shell of CaCO3. CO2 diffuses through pores to react on the surface of inner CaO, which is usually defined as a shrinking core (Di Giuliano et al., 2020b). With increasing reaction time, the reaction products cause the blockage of sorbent surface and the CO2 diffusion resistance increases. This gas-solid reaction shifts from the reaction-controlled stage to the diffusion-controlled stage limited by the thickness of the product layer, as mentioned in Section 2.1. The porosity of Ca-based sorbents is recovered until next regeneration. However, with the progress of CO2 absorption/desorption reaction of Ca-based sorbents, porous structure of CaO is seriously damaged under high temperature. This phenomenon leads to sintering and decrease in the specific surface area and pore volume of Ca-based sorbents, which in turn damages CO2 absorption of CaO (Zhao et al., 2019). CaO appears as more markedly sintered when calcined under higher concentrations of CO2 or steam (Ma et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019b). The deactivation of Ca-based sorbents constitutes the main constraint to the positive effect of CaL during the reforming process. A study from Kim et al. (2019) showed that there was a linear correlation between the CO2 uptake and the duration of the pre-breakthrough period, corresponding to the H2 yield, as presented in Fig. 7. As the cycle number increased, the CO2 capture performance decayed, accompanied by the decrease of H2 yield. This was attributed to the shortening of the pre-breakthrough stage and the decrease of fuel conversion rate. A simulation results for the performance of nano-CaO carbonation with SMR indicated that CH4 conversion declined from 95.3% to 88% by decreasing the carbonation rate constant from 5.74 s−1 to 1.6 s−1 and the pre-breakthrough time was reduced from 20 min to 2 min with the decreased carbonation conversion from 0.9 to 0.3 (Ping and Wu, 2019). Hence, the cyclic CO2 uptake of Ca-based sorbents is a key factor limiting the efficiency of SERP."
5,Modification of Ca-based sorbents with high CO2-reactivity,"To obtain a viable economy of H2 production, Ca-based sorbents have to be recycled through sorption-enhanced reforming/regeneration reactions. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the stability and activity of Ca-based sorbents in the cyclic process for the popularization and commercialization of this technology. A detailed introduction about modification methods and structural characteristics of various Ca-based sorbents is given in this section."
6,Strategies for the improvement of cyclic CO2 capture by Ca-based sorbents,"3.1 Strategies for the improvement of cyclic CO2 capture by Ca-based sorbents 3.1.1 Improvement in porosity The pore structure of Ca-based sorbents is one of the important factors affecting the CO2 capture performance. Researches have shown that CaO obtained after calcination of Ca-based organic salts such as calcium acetate, calcium citrate and calcium oxalate possess superior specific surface area and pore distribution compared to traditional limestone. This phenomenon is attributed to the release of gases as well as the formation of organic matters (such as acetone) during the calcination process, resulting in a more porous structure (Nawar et al., 2019). Thus, Ca-based organic salts are regarded as promising calcium precursors. Pecharaumporn et al. (2019) investigated the sorbent derived from calcium D-gluconic acid and calcium nitrate. The Ca-based organic salts offered CO2 sorption capacity of 0.38 g CO2/g sorbent, which was greater than 0.17 g CO2/g sorbent of calcium nitrate. Nawar et al. (2019) modified the waste marble powder with 8 different organic acids such as acetic acid, citric acid monohydrate, formic acid, etc. The results revealed that increasing the acid volume changed the CO2 uptake and stability of CaO particularly propionic acid and acetic acid. In addition, the waste liquids discharged from the production process of chemical products such as alcohol and wood vinegar contain certain concentration of some organic acids, e.g. acetic acid (Li et al., 2011). Therefore, the cost can be further reduced for the preparation of Ca-based organic salts using these waste liquids. Ca(OH)2 is also considered behaving better CO2 absorption performance than CaO with a similar pore-forming mechanism as Ca-based organic salts. Hydration has been deemed as one of the main methods to improve the cycle CO2 capture of Ca-based sorbents and the related reaction is shown as Eqs. (7) and (8). Wang et al. (2015) compared the apparent morphology of sorbents derived from untreated and hydrated dolomite. Rougher, smaller and more porous particles were found in the hydrated one, accompanied by an increase in the surface area and pore volume in comparison with the untreated one, as shown in Fig. 8. Xu et al. (2016) proposed a hydrated limestone using seawater. The CO2 capture capacity of 0.31 g CO2/g sorbent after 40 cycles was achieved, which was 126% higher than that of natural limestone. Besides, hydration during the high-temperature reaction which influences CO2 capture are discussed in Section 4.3.1. (7) C a O ( s ) + H 2 O ( l ) = C a ( O H ) 2 ( s ) Δ H = - 67 k J / m o l (8) C a O ( s ) + H 2 O ( g ) = C a ( O H ) 2 ( s ) Δ H = - 109 k J / m o l As the reaction proceeds, gas diffusion becomes rate-determining process. From this aspect, novel sorbents with hollow structure can not only reserve the advantages of large specific surface area, but also mitigate the agglomeration at high temperature. Researches showed that the CO2 diffusion resistance was significantly reduced in the CaO with hollow-core shell (Ma et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019a). The prominent feature of this structure is avoiding the incomplete reaction of internal CaO in the process of rapid carbonation, which has been widely used in the research field of CO2 sorbents (Ma et al., 2018, 2019b; Li et al., 2019). As illustrated in Fig. 9, the hollow structures are normally formed through a sacrificed-template process. Ma et al. (2018) and Ma et al. (2019b) successively utilized carbon sphere and paper fiber as the sacrificed templates to synthesize composites Ca-based sorbents with porous cage-like and tube-like shells. Li et al. (2019) prepared Mn-promoted double-shelled hollow CaCO3 using carbon microspheres as templates. It was proved to possess superior surface area of 20 m2/g and sintering resistance. The double-shelled sorbents provided with more reaction active sites than single-shelled sorbents, which exhibited an initial CO2 uptake of 0.62 g/g and a final one of 0.53 g/g after 25 cycles. Preparation of Ca-based materials with stable micro-hollow structure and accurate regulation to enhance the reactivity of CaO and CO2 in the technique combing CaL and SERP are worthy of further research. 3.1.2 Improvement in stability of pore structure The anti-sintering property of Ca-based materials is also an important factor affecting the continuous and stable CO2 capture performance of Ca-based sorbents. Successful attempts have been made to stabilize the microstructure by incorporating inert supports with high Tamman temperature such as CaTiO3 (Aihara et al., 2001), MgO (Ma et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020), CaZrO3 (Luisetto et al., 2020), Ca3Al2O6 (Heidari et al., 2020), and Ca12Al14O33 (Vanga et al., 2019; Di Giuliano et al., 2018a). For example, Aihara et al. (2001) synthesized CaO/CaTiO3 composites and the CaO conversion rate was 0.65 after 10 cycles, which was 2.6 times as high as raw CaO without CaTiO3 addition. Wu et al. (2020) presented a MgO/Al2O3-copromoted Ca-based metal-organic framework by hydrothermal synthesis. The highest CO2 capacity approaching 72% and stability of 77% was achieved in 100 cyclic tests. Considering that the calcination condition plays a decisive role in CO2 absorption performance, a detailed introduction of synthetic Ca-based sorbents calcined under N2, CO2 or steam is given in Table 2. The synthetic materials show inconspicuous sign of performance decay during cycles when pure N2 is applied as calcination atmosphere. However, such mild condition is limited to theoretical research level. The calcination atmospheres with a high concentration of CO2 or steam belong to actual calcination conditions, which can be implemented by oxy-fuel combustion or O2/H2O combustion (Seepana and Jayanti, 2010). Higher decay rates of CO2 uptakes were found under realistic conditions and high concentration of steam was more conducive to CO2 capture by Ca-based sorbents in most studies. For example, Ma et al. (2016) modified carbide slag by high alumina cement and byproduct of biodiesel. The synthetic sorbent with 90 wt% CaO maintained an absorption ratio of 88% under pure steam, the value that was 1.7 times higher than that under pure CO2."
7,Enhanced H2 production with modified Ca-based sorbents,"3.2 Enhanced H2 production with modified Ca-based sorbents With the encouraging experience in the modification of Ca-based materials under CO2 capture conditions, methods have been used for reference in improving the conversion of fuel to H2 in SERP in bench scale. Some newly synthesized Ca-based sorbents with corresponding experimental details are reviewed, as shown in Table 3. It should be noted that CO2 uptakes of different Ca-based sorbents after the same cycles with SEPR/regeneration are given for reference but cyclic CO2 capture/regeneration experiments were performed separately in most studies under different operation conditions with SERP. Sun et al. (2016b) reported that the CaO-MgO-3A sorbent prepared by the wet mixing method using MgO and molecular sieve as support materials showed a more porous microstructure and a relatively high H2 yield for coal gasification, compared with the untreated CaO and the condition without sorbents. Bunma and Kuchonthara (2018) employed CaO-MgO sorbents prepared by wet-physical mixing in order to enhance the H2 production through the pyrolysis-gasification of biomass. The synthetic material showed H2 yield of 21.3 mmol/g biomass with the concentration of 79.8% and the minimum CO2 yield of 1.1 mmol/g biomass. Studies have proved the effectiveness of the system by modifying Ca-based sorbents and catalysts under the optimum conditions separately and loading them in a single reformer. Based on the final forms of synthetics, these materials were termed binary particle mixture. Alshafei et al. (2019) tested sorption-enhanced SMR in a stainless-steel packed bed reactor containing physical mixtures of commercial NiO-based catalyst and CaO-based materials prepared by thermal decomposition, hydrothermal dissolution recrystallization and electrospinning, respectively. This work demonstrated that Al-doped CaO fibers produced via electrospinning increased pre-breakthrough reaction times by more than a factor of 3 compared to commercially CaO. Ca12Al14O33 mitigated CaO crystallite agglomeration and maintained the fibrous structure after 10 cycles of reforming/regeneration. Ce-Ni/MCM-41 as catalysts and Na-Zr promoted CaO as sorbents were investigated via the SEPR of ethanol (Rahmanzadeh and Taghizadeh, 2019). H2 production was 94% at the initial time and showed low decline after 210 min on stream, the value that was about 24% higher than that of conventional steam ethanol reforming. Di Giuliano et al. (2018b) designed an automated bench-scale system with separate beds of Ni-mayenite and CaO-mayenite and carried out more than 200 sorption-enhanced SMR/regeneration cycles. A stable reactivity with CH4 conversion> 95%, pre-breakthrough CO2 concentration< 3% throughout cycles was obtained. Xu et al. (2021) loaded Ni/Al2O3 catalyst and spherical CaO pellet made by a new molding method in a twin vertical reactor and performed SERP of ethanol. The CaO templated by cellulose displayed a porous surface micromorphology with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume 2 times as high as those without cellulose. H2 could be constantly yielded with purity higher than 90% within at least 15 min using the CaO pellets during the 10th cycle."
8,Catalyst-sorbent multifunctional materials,"3.3 Catalyst-sorbent multifunctional materials As is apparent from the above analysis, enhanced H2 production and purity can be achieved with the introduction of various Ca-based sorbents. Nevertheless, the transportation resistance of CO2 molecules between sorbents and catalysts has to be overcome in binary particle mixtures because of the direct mixing route mentioned in the last section. The advanced composites with catalytic and CO2 absorptive coupling behavior have been widely investigated in the latest researches (Chen et al., 2020; Dang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020). Different from the binary particle mixture, multifunctional materials are composite particles with intimate combination of sorbents and catalysts formed through the preparation step. Thus, the transfer efficiency of CO2 between the sorbent and the catalyst speeds up, since CO2 generated in the reforming reaction can be quickly captured by surrounding sorbents. This phenomenon also indicates that the uniformity of element distribution in the composite material is an important basis for the corresponding performance. In addition, the quantity of inactive supports can be reduced for the combined catalyst-sorbent multifunctional materials. Current developments of multifunctional materials are discussed below and summarized, as shown in Table 4. Kim et al. (2019) prepared two CaO and Ru containing materials, Ru/CaO and Ru/Ca3Al2O6/CaO, using a citrate sol-gel route. The duration in the pre-breakthrough period after 10 cycles was declined by 70% and 8% for Ru/CaO and Ru/Ca3Al2O6/CaO, respectively. The presence of Ca3Al2O6 effectively stabilized the porous structure of the material against sintering. Sang et al. (2020) adopted MgO to support both of the Ni catalyst and the CaO sorbent by a coprecipitation method and experimentally speculated that MgO facilitated the dissociation of H2O to form hydroxyl groups that participated in the conversion of CO* and CHx*. The ethanol conversion of 100% and H2 purity higher than 96% were maintained in 10 cycles using the material containing 20 wt% MgO. Chen et al. (2020) combined CaO with different support materials (Al2O3, La2O3, or ZrO2) and metal additives (CoO, MgO, or CeO2) by sol-gel one-pot synthesis. The result indicated that CaO-Al-Co afforded the higher H2 mole fraction and yield, 83% and 0.54 m3/kg in the sorption-enhanced steam gasification of sewage sludge. The good catalytical performance of Co was also confirmed by in other literatures (Dang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020). In addition, Wang et al. (2020) found that adding Co as a guest metal to Ni-based catalyst led to the better catalytic reforming activity during the reforming of phenol. In this work, different bimetallic catalytic sorbents, Ni-M/CaO-Ca12Al14O33 (M = Ce, Co or Cu) were synthesized using a wet impregnation method. Ni-Co/CaO-Ca12Al14O33 exhibited the best cyclic stability and H2 with the yield higher than 2.3 L/g was produced through this process at 650 °C. Some composites with the ability of anti-carbon deposition have been considered (Han et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021; Ashok et al., 2015). Han et al. (2020) pointed out that the effect of Ca on tar reduction was limited and prepared a hybrid iron-calcium sorbent, Ca-Al-Fe. Ca2Fe2O5 in the material was observed to catalyze the reforming of toluene as the tar model component. The sorption property of Ni-CaO/Al2O3 composites in the steam reforming of sewage sludge was probed by Yang et al. (2021). The results showed that the presence of the bifunctional material promoted the tar cracking/reforming for gas production, which also retarded the carbon deposition around Ni catalyst. A similar explanation was reported in the study by Ashok et al. (2015). A structured composite of CaO/Ca9Al6O18 sorbent as the core and Ni/Ca5Al6O14 catalyst as the shell prepared by sol-gel method (core/shell mass ratio = 0.2) was reported by Chen et al. (2017). Approaching 100% CaO conversion was displayed in 60 reforming/regeneration cycles due to the presence of two inert calcium aluminates as carrier. Satrio et al. (2005) synthesized a bifunctional catalyst with CaO core surrounded by a Ni/Al-based shell. The concentration of H2 obtained at 600 °C under atmospheric pressure was higher than 96%. Dang et al. (2020) introduced carbon microspheres as templates in the synthetics of Ni/CaO/MgO bi-functional catalyst and about 109% increase of CaO utilization compared with the commercial CaO was observed. Minkim et al. (2020) introduced a thin layer of Ca3Al2O6 on CaO by atomic layer deposition and obtained Ni/CaO/Ca3Al2O6 material by wet impregnation of coated CaO in the Ni precursor solution. The hollow-sphere structure and the homogeneous distribution of Ca, Al and Ni were visualized, as shown in Fig. 10. This morphology structure resulted in a cyclically stable pre-breakthrough duration for sorption-enhanced WGS process. Vanga et al. (2019) focused on proposals for scaled-up of SERP and developed Ni/CaO/Ca12Al14O33 pellets by a multi-step approach, where the calcium-aluminum oxide ceramic was prepared at first. The pellet showed an enhanced pore volume in the range of 10–100 nm and a rising in specific surface area of 7.1 m2/g compared with CaO. These features favored the CO2 diffusion within the sorbent and the positive effect on the enhanced H2 production. Xu et al. (2016) prepared Ni/CaO/Ca5Al6O14 extrudate, which provided higher activity and stability at a low H2O/CH4 molar ratio of 2 over 20 cycles for the reforming of CH4, as compared to the Ni/CaO/Ca5Al6O14 powder. Most of the studies above were carried out under mild regeneration conditions such as pure N2 and low temperature. However, high concentration of CO2 because of the oxyfuel combustion for CO2 enrichment and relatively higher temperature (e.g. 900 °C–950 °C) are required for the thermodynamic feasibility of CaCO3 decomposition. Yan et al. (2020) evaluated the performance of CeO2-modified CaO/Ca12Al14O33 in SERP of bagasse char under the realistic calcination condition (920 °C, 70% CO2/O2) for industrial application. CeO2 acted as the catalyst and pore stabilizer in the synthetic material, which resulted in a high average H2 yield of 81.1 vol% during 10 cycles. Multifunctional composites of catalyst and sorbent undergo high-temperature regeneration, which exacerbates sintering problem for the catalytic composition. In addition, the incorporation of catalyst such as Ni has been observed to damage the stability of CO2 removal performance by CaO in the precious study (Lee et al., 2015). Di Giuliano et al. (2019) tested Ni and CaO-combined materials in two forms, binary particle mixture and multifunctional catalyst, for over 200 cycles of sorption-enhanced SMR/regeneration. A lower CO2 uptake after cycles was found for the latter one as compared to the former one, which was in agreement with the more marked decrease in pre-breakthrough time for the multifunctional catalyst. Therefore, chemical stability of combined materials is still challenging for further research. The in-situ CO2 removal is closely corresponding to the amount of sorbent in the multifunctional materials. Different ratios of catalyst to sorbent have been applied to the reforming/regeneration tests. Zhang et al. (2020) found that reducing this ratio could increase methane conversion and H2 concentration in the outlet flow, and decrease CO selectivity. However, high loadings of catalysts lead to a reduced CO2 uptake per unit mass of composites in general. Zhao et al. (2016) developed sol-gel-derived Ni/CaO-CaZrO3 with Ni loadings of 5–30 wt%. CH4 conversion of 90% and H2 concentration of 95% were maintained at the pre-breakthrough stage over 90 consecutive reforming/regeneration cycles when the Ni, CaO and CaZrO3 contents of 15%, 60% and 25% were chosen. Dou et al. (2018) studied the effect of molar ratios of Ca to Ni on the sorption-enhanced ethanol reforming. Results showed that the highest H2 selectivity and feeding conversion were obtained at the ratio of 3. Further increasing the Ca/Ni ratio inhibited H2 production, which was ascribed to the dilution of catalytical sites in Ni particles by surrounding sorbents. Therefore, the catalytic activity, CO2 capture capacity and cyclic stability should be taken into account for viable catalyst/sorbent ratios of the combined catalyst, sorbent and support material."
9,Effects of operating conditions on SERP with Ca-based sorbents,"Several new technologies for specific combination of SEPR and CaL have been proposed in recent years. Lin et al. (1999) first proposed the Hydrogen Production by Reaction-Integrated Novel Gasification (HyPr-RING) in 1999. A high concentration of H2 in the product gas (> 80 vol%) and high chemical conversion (> 90%) could be realized using CaO and supercritical water (pressure of 10 MPa and temperature between 600 °C–700 °C). Upgraded processes have been put forward including Zero Emission Coal (ZEC) (Yan et al., 2013), Advanced Gasification Combustion (AGC) (Rizeq et al., 2001), new near-zero emissions coal with combined gasification and combustion (Wang et al., 2003) and sorption-enhanced chemical looping autothermal reforming (SE-CLAR) (Abanades et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2020b; Fernández et al., 2019). The above-mentioned configurations seek for an optimal conversion of carbon-based fuels and H2 production in applicable operation conditions. Compared to the conventional reforming system, the chemical kinetics and heat integration in case of SERP are more complex. Therefore, research progress on the influences of the main parameters included in SERP are summarized and compared in this section."
10,Effect of sorption-enhanced reforming temperature,"4.1 Effect of sorption-enhanced reforming temperature The temperature plays a crucial role in SERP and a wide range of experimental data have been gathered in order to determine the most efficient operating temperature. Elevating temperature is beneficial for the standard reforming process because of the chemical endothermic property, as shown in Eqs. (1)–(4). Xu et al. (2021) presented experiments for the sorption-enhanced reforming of ethanol over a broad temperature range from 550 °C to 700 °C, as shown in Fig. 11. The H2 concentration in the gas product increased as temperature increased in the post-breakthrough period, while the highest CH4 concentration was observed at the lowest temperature. This result was because higher reforming temperature was closely related to the respective equilibrium for the enhanced CH4 conversion. The WGS and CO2 capture reactions subjected to more restriction by temperature rise based on thermodynamics principle. In general, the fuel conversion to the gas product is enhanced with the increased temperature, while CO2 concentration rises and H2 yield is not high under the same condition. For example, the thermodynamic equilibrium temperature (T) of the reaction between CaO and CO2 can be calculated corresponding to the principle of minimum Gibbs free energy (Chakravarti, 2001), as shown in Eq. (9). (9) lg P CO 2 eq = 7.079 − 8308 T Where, P CO2eq is the equilibrium partial pressure of CO2, atm. It is evident that Ca-based sorbents loss the CO2 capture efficiency at around 750 °C for CO2 concentration of 0.1. For this purpose, the operation temperature in the reformer should be below such a value. However, relatively low overall reaction rate would limit the final H2 output from the kinetics theory. Besides, low temperature tends to cause high tar content as previously discussed. Research from Li et al. (2020) showed that around 10 g/m3 of tar could be still found in the product gas during the sorption-enhanced steam gasification of biomass. Wu et al. (2015) found that the reaction activation energy in SERP of coke oven gas was 95 kJ/mol, only one third of the conventional SMR. This relatively low activation energy in SERP attributed to the high CH4 conversion at a low temperature. Another research demonstrated that about 4-fold H2 amount amplification and H2 concentration above 95% were obtained after SERP of coke oven gas by CaO and the temperature range corresponding to the maximum values moved forward to low temperature with CaO presence (Xie et al., 2017). The relationship between temperature and obtained H2 concentration has been well reported in the literature (Dang et al., 2016; Kumari and Mohanty, 2020). Typical results are displayed in Fig. 12 and an overview of the conducted experimental parameters is provided in Table 5. The optimum temperature range of SERP exits and varies in different researches, which is due to different reactors and fuel species to some extent. Vanga et al. (2019) reported that CH4 conversion and H2 yield increased monotonically as the temperature increased from 550 °C to 650 °C. The results from Dang et al. (2016) showed the H2 concentration in the product gas increased with the decreasing temperature from 90.7% at 600 °C to 96.7% at 500 °C during SERP of glycerol, which was because that high temperature was unfavorable for WGS reaction. Kumari and Mohanty (2020) studied the steam gasification of pine needles with CaO as sorbent and catalyst. They demonstrated that the concentration of H2 increased when the temperature increased from 650 °C to 750 °C, while the concentrations of CO, CO2, and CH4 declined because of consumptions in WGS, SMR and carbonation. However, the H2 production dropped beyond 800 °C due to the increase of CO2. Shahbaz et al. (2017) also reported a same trend for H2 yield in which a higher H2 composition (79.8%) was obtained at 692 °C in the range of 650 °C–750 °C during the gasification of palm kernel shell with CaO and coal bottom ash. Abbas et al. (2019) and Abbas et al. (2017a) developed a mathematical model of sorption-enhanced SMR process in an adiabatic packed bed reactor and investigated the effect of temperature on H2 yield. The highest purities of H2 were found at the temperatures of 500 °C and 700 °C under 3 bar and 30 bar, respectively. The optimum temperature range of SERP is a comprehensive consideration of the reaction rate, reactivity of Ca-based sorbents, H2 concentration and tar formation."
11,Effect of pressure,"4.2 Effect of pressure The fuel-to-H2 efficiency of SERP is also highly dependent on the pressure, especially when high temperature in the reformer is considered to accelerate reaction rates. Higher total pressure is able to offset the impact of high temperature, e.g. the compromising CO2 capture efficiency. From the thermodynamic equilibrium point of view, the steam reforming reaction involves an increase in gas phase volume, which is promoted by low pressure. Meanwhile, the WGS reaction is less susceptible to the pressure due to the equability of total moles in the gas phase. In a pressurized case, the reforming efficiency and fuel conversion rate can be significantly improved at a higher temperature. However, this also increases the cost of investment and brings challenges for operation because of the complexity. Barelli et al. (2008) published a comprehensive review of the sorption-enhanced SMR and analyzed the equilibrium H2 molar fractions (dry basis) in the product gas at different pressures with the presence of CaO and a H2O/CH4 ratio of 4. With the increased pressure, the temperature for the maximum H2 yield moved forward to a high temperature. For example, the maximum H2 molar fractions at pressures of 1 atm and 5 atm were reached at 550 °C and 650 °C, respectively. Ping and Wu (2019) analyzed the performance of nano-CaO/Ni in the SMR/CaO carbonation stage, which took place in a tubular fixed-bed reactor. The CH4 conversion under 1 bar and 5 bar were 96.2% and 76%, respectively. This phenomenon indicated that the negative effect of pressure rise on SMR was pronounced than the positive effect on carbonation. Meanwhile, higher pressure gave sharply shortened pre-breakthrough duration and further lower H2 purity. Fernandez et al. (2012) compared the product gas composition during SERP by CaO/CuO/NiO-Al2O3 under different pressures (0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 MPa) at 923 K with a steam/CH4 molar ratio of 5 and a space velocity of 3.5 kg/(m2·s). A maximum H2 purity of 95% on a dry basis was obtained at 0.5 MPa, as against H2 purity of 92% at 3.5 MPa. In this case, the methane concentration in the product gas increased from 2% to 8.2%, corresponding to fuel conversions of 95% and 82%, respectively. Hanaoka et al. (2005) conducted the experiment in an autoclave with oak and Ca(OH)2 in it. Results showed that the H2 yield and conversion of biomass to gas exhibited maximum values at 0.6 MPa, and decreased with increasing reaction pressures above 0.6 MPa. However, the results were contradicted with a study of Lin et al. (2004). The relevant data are reproduced here, as shown in Fig. 13. The determination of product gas concentration was based on the flow-type reactor in which coal/CaO and high-pressure steam (0.1–6 MPa) were continuously introduced and products were removed during the reaction. In general, the H2 yield increased and the proportions of the hydrocarbon gases, CO, and CO2 decreased as pressure increased. The CO2 concentration remained constant with an increase in pressure, which was attributed to the formation of Ca(OH)2 above 3 MPa and the weak effect of steam partial pressure on the CO2 absorption by Ca(OH)2. A detailed comparison is difficult due to the difference in operation systems (e.g. reactor type, detailed fuel type)."
12,Effect of steam,"4.3 Effect of steam The effect of steam on SERP is mainly embodied in the fuel conversion of the reforming process and CO2 capture rate. There exist large quantities of researches that involve various steam concentrations considered from the perspective of CO2 capture and H2 output. These cases are described separately in the following sections. 4.3.1 Effect of steam on CO2 separation In the reformer that combines the H2 production and CO2 separation, steam is a typical component in the atmosphere. Hydration of Ca-based sorbents is expected to proceed according to Eq. (8), which further influences the carbonation process. Yang and Xiao (2008) reported that surface hydroxyl groups with the presence of steam and bicarbonates as intermediates were formed. Dong et al. (2020) investigated the carbonation efficiency with in-situ high-temperature steam in a bubbling fluidized-bed reactor. The transient formation and decomposition of Ca(OH)2 resulted in the improved particle pore properties such as surface area and pore volume, which were closely related to the sorbent performance (Dong et al., 2020; Yancheshmeh et al., 2016). Another hypothesis on steam enhancing carbonation was proposed and analyzed (Li et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2020), as shown in Fig. 14. It was found that the diffusion resistance of O2- from the reactant side to CO2 side was large due to the thick CaCO3 product layer. OH- formation from H2O dissociation could accelerate O2- and CO3 2- diffusion process on the surface of Ca-based sorbents and therefore improved the carbonation performance. Labotka et al. (2011) confirmed the amplified positive effect with the increasing steam concentration by experiments. He et al. (2016) varied the steam concentration in the atmosphere from 10% to 60% at 650 °C for 5 min carbonation. The trend in both data series showed a significant increase in carbonation conversion of carbide slag corresponding with the increased steam concentration, which was attributed to a greater CO2 diffusion through the product layer. Further mechanism of steam presence in CO2 absorption by CaO is discussed in the context of surface adsorption issues in Section 5. On the contrary, Li et al. (2020) reported that the increase of steam in the enhanced gasification of biomass for H2 production led to the decrease in CO2 partial pressure in the atmosphere. As a result, the CO2 concentration in the product gas increased, which indicated that the CO2 absorption rate by CaO decreased. The presence of steam in the regeneration atmosphere can lower the CO2 partial pressure, accompanied by the decreased the decomposition temperature of CaCO3 (He et al., 2020). This hinders the sintering of sorbents and facilitates the maintenance of carbonation reactivity. It was experimentally found that the presence of steam in the calcination atmosphere moved the starting point of CaCO3 decomposition forward and also increased the reaction rate significantly (He et al., 2020). 4.3.2 Effect of steam/carbon ratio on H2 production Increasing the steam composition in the feed, i.e. elevating steam/carbon ratio, is expected to positively influence the equilibriums of steam reforming reaction and WGS. This would cause an increase in H2 yield, CO2 formed and also a decrease in the CO content and hydrocarbon species in the product gas, such as CH4. A range of carbonaceous fuels have been applied to investigate SERP, including methane (Ni et al., 2017; Ou et al., 2021), ethanol (Dou et al., 2018; Hanak et al., 2018), glycerol (Macedo et al., 2021), biomass (Zhang et al., 2020), etc. On this basis we only focused on the effect of general steam/carbon ratio (S/C) on H2 production and ignored the extra properties of different fuels in the following discussion. Nam et al. (2020) and Kihedu et al. (2016) reported that carbon conversion efficiency from the steam-air gasification was higher than that from air gasification, which was attributed to the higher reactivity between biomass and steam. The presence of steam reduced the overall yield of contaminant gases, such as HCN, SO2, HCl and NH3. Higher H2 yield was obtained when more steam was introduced in the steam/biomass ratio range from 0.74 to 2.34 (Nam et al., 2020). Ghungrud and Vaidya (2020) investigated sorption-enhanced steam reforming of ethanol over hybrid materials made of cobalt (10 wt%) and Ca-based sorbents modified by CeO2, ZrO2, and MgO with different S/C ratios in the range of 3–12. The results showed that Co/CaO/CeO2, Co/CaO/ZrO2 and Co/CaO/MgO displayed the highest H2 concentration, 92.1%, 89.9% and 75.1%, at an S/C ratio of 10, 10 and 6, respectively. An extremely high ratio of S/C led to the dilution of H2 concentration and a limited CO2 absorption. Abbas et al. (2017b) studied the effect of S/C on SMR with NiO/CaO by a mathematical model. Based on the results illustrated in Fig. 15, the maximum conversion about 82% was achieved at the highest S/C considered of 4, and under the same conditions, the CO2 capturing efficiency, the purity and yield of H2 were 75%, 91% and 32%, respectively. S/C value of 3 was recommended for reforming reactions on industrial scale from economic consideration. It was reported that the presence of steam in the feed mitigated the unsaturated hydrocarbon from intermediate reactions including dehydrogenation and dehydration reactions, which got polymerized to unwanted coke later (Sharma et al., 2017). A high value of S/C is usually applied to reduce carbon deposit in the industrial applications. However, with the increase of S/C, the energy consumption also significantly increases. Qiao et al. (2016) analyzed the energy assessment of SERP and the calculation showed that the energy consumption for reactants preheating with the steam/ethanol ratio of 10:1 was about 1.8 times as high as that with the ratio of 4:1. Chen et al. (2011) demonstrated that with CO2 sorbents added into the reactor, the steam demand for the equally lower CO concentration was much less compared to the case without sorbents. Besides, developing anti-carbon deposition Ca-based sorbents is a feasible way to reduce S/C ratio, as mentioned in Section 3.3. Specially, Sikarwar et al. (2017) proposed a new concept of CO2 sorption-enhanced co-gasification of wood and sewage sludge, where the high content of moisture in sewage sludge could act as a gasifying agent, and as a result, no additional steam was supplied."
13,Effect of flow rate of feed,"4.4 Effect of flow rate of feed The flow rate of feed, also termed liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV), reaction liquid space velocity (RLSV) or weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), reflects the residence duration of the feedstock in the reactor. Liu et al. (2020) conducted experiments using Ni/CaO/Al2O3 bi-functional materials under different feeding rates in the range of 0.03–0.08 mL/min. Representative data are given in Fig. 16. As the rate increased, the durations of pre-breakthrough and breakthrough stages were remarkably shortened. According to Zhang et al. (2020), a low feeding rate promoted an increased H2 concentration and a decreased CO concentration in the product gas. The phenomenon was attributed to the prolonged residence time of reactants, which benefited the complete chemical reactions, such as WGS and carbonation. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the reforming is a fast reaction that is almost finished in the very beginning (Wu et al., 2014), while carbonation is relatively slow because of the diffusion-controlled stage. Therefore, the complete CO2 separation from the product side of the reforming and WGS is prone to achieve at a low feeding rate that amplifies the sorption-enhanced effect. However, descending the rate inevitable leads to a decline in H2 production rate and total efficiency."
14,Effect of particle size,"4.5 Effect of particle size The smaller size of sorbent or catalyst particles would expose more basic active sites on surfaces. On the contrary, higher particle size gives rise to the limited contact area and a higher gas diffusion resistance, which penalize entire reaction rates. Zhang et al. (2020) investigated the effects of sorbent particle size distribution on SERP of coke oven gas, where 0.6–0.85 mm represented a more uniform distribution and 0.075–0.85 mm represented a wide size distribution. Experiments showed that H2 concentration was higher and CH4 concentration was lower in the product with a narrow range of CaO. High-content fine CaO particles on the condition of the wide particle range caused the hindered catalytic efficiency. Another impact of particle size is the bed pressure difference in the application. Tiny particles achieve higher carbonation conversion because of lower diffusion resistance. However, the reactor resistance would be elevated, which brings difficulties in operation. According to Cheng et al. (1996), spinel-like carbon tended to deposit on the active surface of catalysts with larger particle size and the metallic catalyst was found hard to be regenerated below 700 °C with the carbon surrounded. The conclusion was consistent with Challa et al. (2011) and Kim et al. (2000). They proposed that carbon was prone to be formed at the edge and step sites of metallic Ni, which were pronounced in large particles (> 5 nm). Kim et al. (2019) confirmed that the synthetics by citrate sol-gel method consisted of smaller catalytic nanoparticles and showed a significantly lower rate of carbon formation, compared with that prepared by impregnation method."
15,Density Functional Theory study on adsorption/catalysis behavior with Ca-based sorbents,"Although a large number of researches were carried out on the synthesis and sorption-enhanced characteristics of Ca-based sorbents, the mechanism has not been fully clarified due to the accuracy and measurement scale of facilities. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is an effective tool for the understanding of reaction from the atomic level, e.g. atomic structure, bonding mechanism and main reaction pathway (He et al., 2021). SERP is a complex adsorption and catalysis system. On this basis, the applications of DFT in both of the adsorption and catalysis part are summarized. And it puts forward ideas for simulation of tar removal with the presence of Ca-based sorbents. The adsorption characteristics of CO2 on the surface of CaO have been revealed by DFT calculation. Wang et al. (2017) found different CO2 adsorption properties on alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb an d Cs)-doped CaO (100) surfaces, which provided theoretical guidance for the selection of support materials and performance prediction for Ca-based sorbents. Liu et al. (2017) explored the effect of various metal promoters (Al, Mg, Zr, Na) on carbonation reactivity of CaO. Calculations showed that the former two weakened the adsorption energy and the latter two enhanced the adsorption energy. Ma et al. (2018) put forward a model of Ca12Al14O33-supported CaO. The strong interaction between CaO cluster and Al sites on the surface of Ca12Al14O33 was found, which played a decisive role in stabilizing the structures of CaO. In their following research, the same model was applied to investigate the co-adsorption of CO2 and H2O (Ma et al., 2019c). The adsorption energy of CO2 on CaO/Ca12Al14O33 with H2O presence was −3.32 eV, the value higher than that without H2O. Hence, the adsorption of H2O benefited CO2 adsorption on CaO. The result consisted with Yang et al. (2019). Sun et al. (2016a) obtained the transition state during the calcination process with CO2 physisorbed on CaCO3 surface and the rate of calcination was controlled by the chemical reaction step instead of mass transfer step. A better understanding of surface reactions with the presence of catalysts is essential for the selection of more efficient catalysts. Niu et al. (2020) applied DFT to study the SMR process and proposed the reaction mechanism of catalytical pathway on Ni, Pt and single layer core-shell structured Ni/Pt, as shown in Fig. 17. The results proved that CH was more favored to be oxidized rather than cracking into carbon and OH*-assisted CH4 activation was the primary pathway on the Ni/Pt surface, which indicated that Ni/Pt remained high catalytic activity and carbon resistance during SMR. Noor et al. (2020) dealt with a DFT study of reaction mechanism and kinetics of WGS on the Ni catalyst, and the result was equally applied to SERP. They claimed that the surrounding adsorbed H* reduced the adsorption strength of O* to a greater extent compared to H* and CO*, which boosted the reaction between CO* and O* and thus the CO2 formation. Cui et al. (2018) employed benzaldehyde as a coal-based model compound and reported that CaO played a role in catalytic pyrolysis process by reducing the energy barrier. There are few studies on the simulation of small gas molecule adsorption on CaO-based sorbents in the catalytic reforming system. Wu et al. (2019) studied a Ni/CaO catalyst and compared the physisorption adsorption energy of CH4 and CO2 on Ni (111) and CaO (100) surfaces, respectively. It was reported that CH4 was prior to be absorbed on Ni (111) and CO2 was prior to be absorbed on CaO (100). A cooperation effect between Ni and CaO was found on the interface. Zhao et al. (2019) simulated the molecular competition adsorption on the CaO/Ni catalyst surface and the adsorption energies of various gas molecules followed the order: H2O > CO2> CO > CH4> H2. Consequently, the increase of CO2 adsorption energy on the 10 wt% CaO/Ni surface compared to the CaO surface was the largest one among all molecules, e.g. from 1.45 eV to 1.81 eV, which showed that Ni/CaO catalyst had an important effect on SERP. In the aspect of tar reduction, DFT was also applied to analyze the related primitive reaction of tar formation in SERP. Liu et al. (2019) investigated the potential change in surface properties of Ni catalyst with the presence of CaO in the multifunctional material. Results showed that Ca could play its role through many possible mechanisms, including slowing down the C‐Cformation rate, accelerating the oxidation of C to form CO and enhancing H2O dissociation to provide sufficient O intermediates, as shown in Fig. 18(a)–(c). Thus, the incorporation of CaO could effectively inhibit carbon deposition on Ni surface. Wang et al. (2020b) selected toluene as a model compound of tar in sorption-enhanced biomass pyrolysis and simulated the tar conversion using Ni-Fe/CaO. The bi-metal catalyst Ni-Fe/CaO was proved to be more conducive to toluene cracking reaction than Ni/CaO, since the energy barrier to generate H2 decreased from 1.5 eV to 0.58 eV."
16,Issues and challenges,"In SERP, the most basic criteria for CO2 sorbents are a high absorption activity at the reaction temperature (500 °C–700 °C) and the decomposition temperature higher than the reforming temperature. Many high-temperature sorbents except CaO have been investigated as candidate materials in SERP, such as Li2ZrO3 (Ni et al., 2017), Na2ZrO3 (Wang et al., 2019; Ji et al., 2018), Li4SiO4 (Wang et al., 2019) and hydrotalcite (Dewoolkar and Vaidya, 2017). However, Li-based sorbents are argued to be prohibitively expensive (Florin and Harris, 2008). The reported rate of CO2 capture for hydrotalcite is limited and cannot satisfy the industrial requirements (Dewoolkar and Vaidya, 2017). The maximum adsorption capacities of Na2ZrO3 and hydrotalcite were reported to be 4.5 mmol CO2/g (Wang et al., 2019) and 0.4 mmol CO2/g (Sun et al., 2020), respectively, which were too low to compete with Ca-based ones. Florin and Harris (2008) argued that using Ca-based sorbents, for the in situ capture of CO2, would be the most technically and economically viable technique for application to the sorption enhanced H2 production. The main trends for future works of CO2 sorbents include: (i) sintering resistance related to the sorbent durability, and (ii) attrition resistance for fluidization operation. Many existing modified Ca-based sorbents mentioned above exhibit superior shift effect in the steam reforming experiments. The performance of composite materials in SERP is affected by both structure and reaction conditions. Therefore, the combined effect mechanism remains to be further studied. In addition, different pretreatments or modification methods leads to various levels of cost-rising. Economically friendly process as well as reliable scheme combining multi-scale modeling with the final performance are recommended for novel porous materials. The H2 production from biomass with a wide range of sources is CO2 neutral, which is superior to fossil fuel conversion. For instance, Capa et al. (2020) adopted biogas produced from biodegradable organic materials via anaerobic digestion as the fuel resource and performed dolomite-enhanced steam reforming of biogas in a bubbling fluidized bed. 98.4 vol% H2 with 91% yield was experimentally obtained. Bioethanol is an aqueous solution of ethanol (8%–15% V/V) or concentrated solution by simple distillation (15%–50% V/V) prepared from biomass, which can be directly used as raw material for reforming process and provide a certain proportion of water and alcohol (Liu et al., 2020). Bio-oil is another product of biomass obtained through rapid pyrolysis and has a great advantage of high energy density (Di Giuliano et al., 2020a). Soria et al. (2019) found that it was possible to obtain 81% of the maximum theoretical H2 yield for spruce bio-oil and 85% of the maximum yield for wheat bio-oil with the presence of CaO. In addition, large quantities of industrial wastes with a relatively high energy content are generated every year, such as sewage sludge from wastewater treatment (Yang et al., 2021), coke oven gas from coke-making process (Y. Chen et al., 2017), plastic wastes (Lazzarotto et al., 2020), paper recycling black liquor (Li et al., 2020), etc. The direct discharge and even disposal of them damage the environment and cause a waste of energy. Therefore, production of high-purity H2 from industrial wastes has been implemented with the urgent need to reduce pollutant emission. Y. Chen et al. (2017) simulated the sorption-enhanced steam reforming of coke oven gas in a pilot-scale fluidized bed. A catalyst/sorbent ratio of 0.2–1, steam/CH4 ratio of 3.3–4.3, reforming temperature of 580 °C were suggested for the process under the atmosphere pressure to obtain products with H2> 95% and CO < 1%. Li et al. (2020) demonstrated the feasibility of generating high-purity H2 (~96%) with 0.9 mol H2 yield per unit mol of carbon via SERP of black liquor using Ni/CaO/Ca12Al14O33. Notably, Na and K from black liquor may spoil the catalyst performance. Further information about the effect of impurities in these wastes should be included in the future work. High-temperature regeneration constitutes the major cost of energy not only because of the endothermic process, but also because the energy requirement for lifting temperature of Ca-based sorbents loaded in the regenerator. Chemical looping has been developed to combined with SERP in order to bring down the energy input during the regeneration, which is defined as SE-CLAR (Hafizi et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020a). The general advantages of this process are: (i) exothermic partial oxidation and CO2 absorption in the reformer where the heat is transferred to reforming reaction directly; (ii) exothermic oxidation reactions of oxygen carrier, providing heat for endothermic calcination of CaCO3. Omoniyi and Dupont (2019) carried out 20 cycles of SE-CLAR of acetic acid at 650 °C, with S/C of 3 and feeding rate of 1.18 h−1, cyclically alternating with air feed at 850 °C. 80% of acetic acid conversion was reached during all cycles with H2 purity> 96%. Hafizi et al. (2019) tested mixtures of Ce-promoted Ca-based sorbent by co-precipitation method and Co3O4/SiO2 oxygen carrier by incipient wetness impregnation method for the SE-CLAR of methane. Results showed that the H2 purity increased up to 95% at relatively low temperature of 550 °C. Nimmas et al. (2020) found that complete regeneration temperature of CaO was at 800 °C using multifunctional materials composed of bi-metallic CuO/NiO. This meant the reduction of calcination temperature by 50 °C, which accounted for 14% thermal energy reduction. Antzaras et al. (2020b) utilized CaO/CaZrO3 as CO2 sorbent and NiO/ZrO2 as oxygen carrier/reforming catalyst to analyze the optimization of heat coupling during the regeneration step of the intensified SMR. The results indicated that up to 50% of the calcination demands could be provided by Ni oxidation with the NiO/CaO ratio of 0.5. Dang et al. (2019) put forward a concept about the direct conversion of CaCO3 formed from calcination to syngas by reacting with CH4, as shown in Eq. (10). The process combined the advantages of high-purity H2 production and in-situ CO2 utilization. Therefore, the economic evaluation is necessary for future research and integrating H2 production with by-product conversion, renewable resources utilization, waste recycling and heat coupling optimization are worthy of exploration.

17,Conclusions,"The total energy demand increases constantly worldwide. H2 as an alternative and low-carbon energy can effectively alleviate the energy crisis. However, the development of H2 production has been restricted because of the improper cost and efficiency for industrial applications. SERP has a broad prospect with advantages on low energy consumption, high carbon conversion rate, high H2 concentration generated and CO2 captured with high concentration that can be directly stored and utilized. Improving the CO2 removal ability of Ca-based sorbents in SERP can improve the efficiency of the reforming reaction, ensure a high concentration of H2 and keep the concentrations of CO and CO2 at a low level. A key requirement for the process is the availability of effective Ca-based sorbents with high sintering-resistance. Modification methods such as improvement of pore structure and incorporation of support materials can effectively improve the cycle CO2 capture performance of Ca-based sorbents and thus the H2 production. The selection of optimal Ca-based sorbents is a comprehensive consideration of enhanced performance for H2 production, cyclic stability and economic efficiency when the whole industrial chain is considered. The comprehensive consideration of economic operation condition based on different fuels and processes should be given for the future work. DFT calculation is a viable tool for gaining intensive insight into combined adsorption/catalysis process and can play a powerful role in optimizing catalysts/sorbents design."
