0,Introduction,"Microbial strategies to produce wine with less ethanol are required to reverse a trend over recent decades where the average ethanol concentration of wine has increased (Godden and Muhlack, 2010; Robinson, 2012). This trend has been driven largely by consumer preference for wine styles dependent upon sugar-rich ‘flavour-ripe’ grapes. Resultant wines with high levels of ethanol can be perceived negatively due to health concerns linked to excessive alcohol consumption (Grant, 2010; MacAvoy, 2010), compromised wine quality (Athes et al., 2004; Guth and Sies, 2001) and taxation levied according to alcohol content. Whilst a number of viticultural and engineering strategies have been pursued to achieve this goal (Belisario-Sanchez et al., 2009; Bindon et al., 2013; Schmidtke et al., 2012; Stoll et al., 2010), using wine yeast to produce wine with reduced alcohol content remains one of the simplest potential approaches for winemakers to implement. However, commercially available S. cerevisiae wine strains exhibit similar ethanol yields when fermenting the same must (Palacios et al., 2007; Varela et al., 2008), therefore research has focused on generating new S. cerevisiae strains that produce less alcohol than traditional wine yeast during fermentation (Ehsani et al., 2009; Kutyna et al., 2010; Tilloy et al., 2014; Varela et al., 2012). Non-Saccharomyces yeast are part of the natural microbiota present on grapes, and harvesting and winemaking equipment, and are present at least during the early stages of fermentation (Fleet and Heard, 1993; Renouf et al., 2005, 2007). While generally incapable of completing alcoholic fermentation, their application in co-inoculation or sequential inoculation with S. cerevisiae is increasingly popular (Ciani et al., 2006; Ciani and Maccarelli, 1998; Comitini et al., 2011; Jolly et al., 2006; Soden et al., 2000), particularly for their effects on wine composition, flavour and aroma (Benito et al., 2011; Ciani et al., 2006; Comitini et al., 2011; Cordero Otero et al., 2003; Di Maio et al., 2012; Domizio et al., 2011a; Ehsani et al., 2012; Garcia et al., 2002; Jolly et al., 2006, 2014; Magyar and Toth, 2011; Morata et al., 2012; Soden et al., 2000; Toro and Vazquez, 2002). Recently, a specific strain of the non-Saccharomyces species Metschnikowia pulcherrima was shown to produce wines with 0.9-1.6% (v/v) less ethanol when used in sequential inoculation (Contreras et al., 2015), with more substantial decreases possible when combined with a strain of Saccharomyces uvarum (Contreras et al., 2014). Given the vast potential for diverse wine relevant phenotypes amongst non-Saccharomyces yeast, it has been proposed that strains able to utilise oxygen to oxidise grape sugars could be used to decrease ethanol concentration in wine (Gonzalez et al., 2013). Unlike S. cerevisiae, which favours fermentative metabolism over aerobic respiration when sugar concentration exceeds 10 g/L (due to the Crabtree effect), many non-Saccharomyces yeast are able to use oxygen for growth regardless of sugar concentration (Alexander and Jeffries, 1990; de Deken, 1966) and thus, divert carbon into other metabolites and therefore away from ethanol formation. The most studied of these Crabtree-negative yeast include Hanseniaspora uvarum, Kluyveromyces lactis and K. marxianus (Bellaver et al., 2004; González Siso et al., 1996; Postma et al., 1989; Venturin et al., 1995; Verduyn et al., 1991; Zeeman et al., 2000). Although aeration is a common practice in commercial wine production, performed through ‘pump-overs’ or macro-oxygenation techniques, data on the impact of air addition on ethanol production by non-Saccharomyces yeast is scarce. While some studies have reported reduced ethanol production (Brandam et al., 2013; Erten and Tanguler, 2010; Quiros et al., 2014) the culture and aeration conditions tested (e.g. agitation up to 1000 rpm, aeration rate up to 1 volume of air per volume of culture per minute - VVM) were considerably different to what might reasonably be applied during winemaking. In the present work, we evaluated 48 non-Saccharomyces isolates, covering 33 species belonging to 21 different genera, with the aim of identifying yeasts that, with limited aeration and in sequential inoculation with S. cerevisiae, could be used for the reduction of alcohol concentration in wine. A chemically defined grape juice medium was used in order to provide reproducible fermentation conditions."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganisms and media,"2.1 Microorganisms and media Forty-eight non-Saccharomyces isolates were obtained from the Australian Wine Research Institute (AWRI) Wine Microorganism Culture Collection (WMCC) (Table 1 ). Cryogenically preserved strains (-80°C) were cultured and maintained on YM plates (3 g/L malt extract, 3 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L peptone, 10 g/L glucose, 16 g/L agar) and stored at 4°C. Defined medium used in screening and confirmation analyses consisted of 75 g/L glucose, 75 g/L fructose, 3 g/L tartaric acid and 6.76 g/L Yeast Nitrogen Base adjusted to pH 3.5. Chemically Defined Grape Juice (CDGJ) medium consisted of (per litre): glucose 100 g, fructose 100 g, citric acid 0.2 g, malic acid 3 g, potassium hydrogen tartrate 2.5 g, K2HPO4 1.1 g, MgSO4 .7H2O 1.5 g, CaCl2 .2H2O 0.4 g, H3BO3 0.04 g, proline 0.84 g, nitrogen mix solution 20 mL, trace elements stock solution 1 mL, vitamins solution 1 mL, fatty acids stock solution 1 mL, and sterol stock solution 1 mL (Schmidt et al., 2011). CDGJ contained 307 mg N/L of yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN)."
3,Screening of non-Saccharomyces yeasts,"2.2 Screening of non-Saccharomyces yeasts Strains were screened individually in small-scale (250 mL) bioreactors (Medicel Oy, Finland) that enabled control of sparging gas flow and composition. Starter cultures of all yeast strains were grown overnight in YM medium under semi-aerobic conditions at 22°C, shaking at 200 rpm. These cultures were then used to inoculate 200 mL of defined medium at a final optical density of 0.1 (OD600 nm). Ferments were performed at 22°C (200 rpm) under semi-aerobic conditions in bioreactors. Semi-aerobic conditions were attained by sparging sterile filtered (0.22 μm, Millipore) air continuously into the medium at 5 mL/min (0.025 VVM) with a stainless steel diffuser. Aeration rate for each bioreactor was controlled by using a flow meter (Medicel Oy, Finland). The acronym VVM corresponds to the volume of air sparged (in litres) per volume of culture (in litres) per minute. After four days, fermentations were stopped and samples taken for analysis, including ethanol concentration and sugar consumption. Fermentations inoculated with S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 were used as controls."
4,Evaluation of candidate ‘low-ethanol’ strains in sequential inoculation trials in defined medium,"2.3 Evaluation of candidate ‘low-ethanol’ strains in sequential inoculation trials in defined medium Non-Saccharomyces strains identified from the above screening as having reduced ethanol yields relative to S. cerevisiae were evaluated in triplicate using small-scale bioreactors as described above. After four days of fermentation, S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 was inoculated into each bioreactor (OD600 equivalent to 0.1) to ensure completion of fermentation. Samples were taken for analysis 7 days after initial inoculation with non-Saccharomyces strains."
5,Non-Saccharomyces/S. cerevisiae sequential fermentations in Chemically Defined Grape Juice medium,"2.4 Non-Saccharomyces/S. cerevisiae sequential fermentations in Chemically Defined Grape Juice medium Non-Saccharomyces strains able to consume more than 95% of initial sugar and produce reduced ethanol concentration in the above sequential inoculation trials were evaluated in CDGJ medium. Fermentations were performed in triplicate in 200 mL using small-scale bioreactors. Starter cultures were grown overnight in YM medium under aerobic conditions at 22°C, shaking at 200 rpm, and then inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 into CDGJ medium. Ferments were performed at 22°C with agitation (200 rpm). When 50% of sugar was consumed by non-Saccharomyces strains, S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 was inoculated into each ferment (OD600 equivalent to 0.1) to ensure completion of fermentation. Samples were taken for analysis daily until fermentation finished (98% sugar consumed) or for 2 weeks. To assess the impacts of volume, timing and duration of oxygen additions on ethanol yield, four different aeration treatments were compared. Sterile gases (air or nitrogen) were sparged into the medium through a stainless steel diffuser. Treatment I: aeration at 5 mL/min (0.025 VVM) throughout fermentation until completion. Treatment II: aeration at 5 mL/min (0.025 VVM) for the first 24 hours. After this time air was replaced by nitrogen gas. Sparging was maintained at the same rate (0.025 VVM) until fermentation was completed. Treatment III: aeration at 5 mL/min (0.025 VVM) until 50% of the sugar was consumed. After this and simultaneous with S. cerevisiae inoculation, air was replaced by nitrogen gas. Sparging was maintained at the same rate (0.025 VVM) until fermentation was completed. Treatment IV: aeration at 10 mL/min (0.05 VVM) until 50% of the sugar was consumed. After this and simultaneous with S. cerevisiae inoculation, air was replaced by nitrogen gas. Sparging was maintained at the same rate (0.05 VVM) until fermentation was completed. Anaerobic controls with S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 were performed introducing nitrogen gas at the same rates as above."
6,Analytical techniques,"2.5 Analytical techniques Yeast growth was followed spectrophotometrically by measuring optical density at 600 nm. Ethanol, glucose, fructose, glycerol and organic acids were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a BioRad HPX87H column as described previously (Varela et al., 2004)."
7,Statistical analysis,2.6 Statistical analysis Differences between measurements were determined using analysis of variance (LSD test) with the statistical software Statgraphics Centurion v5.0. Differences were considered significant when p values were lower than 0.05. Treatments were compared to each other using Tukey’s multiple comparison post-hoc test.
8,Results,
9,Screening of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in aerobic conditions,"3.1 Screening of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in aerobic conditions Forty-eight non-Saccharomyces yeast strains of species frequently present in grape must including strains from three species previously shown to be Crabtree-negative, Hanseniaspora uvarum, Kluyveromyces lactis and Kluyveromyces marxianus (Bellaver et al., 2004; González Siso et al., 1996; Postma et al., 1989; Venturin et al., 1995; Zeeman et al., 2000), were screened for sugar consumption and ethanol yields under limited aerobic conditions, over four days. Some of these yeasts consumed small amounts of sugar while others utilised up to 97% (Table 1). Ethanol yield, defined as the amount of ethanol produced per gram of consumed sugar, was estimated to identify strains that diverted carbon away from ethanol production. Nine strains exhibiting ethanol yields lower than 0.34 g ethanol/g sugar consumed, which was considerably less than the S. cerevisiae control (0.46 g ethanol/g sugar), and consumed at least approximately 30% of the initial sugar within four days were chosen for subsequent sequential inoculation experiments (Table 1). None of the previously described Crabtree-negative yeasts met these criteria but, because of their potential for facultative aerobic metabolism, one strain from each species (H. uvarum AWRI863, K. lactis AWRI1181 and K. marxianus AWRI1005) were included in subsequent sequential inoculation trials."
10,Preliminary sequential inoculation trials in defined medium,"3.2 Preliminary sequential inoculation trials in defined medium Candidate low-alcohol strains were grown individually in defined medium under aerobic conditions, and after four days S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 was inoculated into all fermentations. The control, inoculated only with S. cerevisiae AWRI1631, yielded 0.45 g ethanol/g sugar with 99.8% of consumed sugar (Table 2 ). Six of the sequentially inoculated fermentations gave an ethanol yield significantly (p<0.05) lower than this value. However, several of these failed to complete fermentation within 7 days. Sequential fermentations using Wickerhamomyces anomalus AWRI1051, Metschnikowia pulcherrima AWRI1656, Candida stellata AWRI1159, Schizosaccharomyces pombe AWRI141 or K. lactis AWRI1181 gave the lowest sugar consumption; sequential fermentations using Torulaspora delbrueckii AWRI1152, Pichia kudriavzevii AWRI1220, or Zygosaccharomyces bailii AWRI1578 gave the highest (at least 96%). Interestingly T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 fermentations produced higher concentrations of glycerol, and malic and succinic acids, than the control S. cerevisiae AWRI1631. As previously described (Quiros et al., 2014), under aerobic conditions S. cerevisiae produced high levels of acetic acid. Sequential inoculations with T. delbrueckii AWRI1152, P. kudriavzevii AWRI1220, or Z. bailii AWRI1578 produced less acetic acid than S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 alone. Similar to T. delbrueckii AWRI1152, and despite consuming less sugar than S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 alone, C. stellata AWRI1159 produced the highest glycerol concentration in sequential fermentations. W. anomalus AWRI1051 produced the highest concentrations of acetic acid, while H. uvarum AWRI863 produced the highest concentrations of succinic acid (Table 2)."
11,"Non-Saccharomyces/S. cerevisiae sequential, partially aerated, fermentations in CDGJ medium","3.3 Non-Saccharomyces/S. cerevisiae sequential, partially aerated, fermentations in CDGJ medium T. delbrueckii AWRI1152, P. kudriavzevii AWRI1220 and Z. bailii AWRI1578 were each evaluated in sequential inoculation experiments with S. cerevisiae AWRI631 in CDGJ medium. S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 was inoculated into the cultures after 50% of the initial sugar had been consumed by the non-Saccharomyces strains. Four aeration treatments, consisting of different oxygen additions over limited time periods, were trialled. Aeration decreased ethanol concentration in sequential inoculations regardless of treatment. While most fermentations inoculated solely with S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 showed similar ethanol concentration than the anaerobic control, the highest aeration rate (Treatment IV) reduced ethanol production and increased acetic acid formation. Across treatments sequential inoculation with T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 produced the highest glycerol concentration while Z. bailii AWRI1578 ferments showed the lowest malic acid concentration (Table 3 ). 3.3.1 Treatment I For Treatment I air was sparged into the medium at 0.025 VVM for the duration of the fermentation. Although S. cerevisiae AWRI1631, T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 and Z. bailii AWRI1578 had similar growth rates, S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 completed fermentation the most rapidly, in 4 days. T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 ferments were inoculated with S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 after 3 days (approximately 50% sugar consumption), and completed fermentation after 6 days (Fig. 1A). Z. bailii AWRI1578 ferments produced the highest optical density (OD600 nm) and were sequentially inoculated after 3 days and completed fermentation after 8 days. P. kudriavzevii AWRI1220 ferments gave the lowest optical density (Fig. 2A) and were slowest, consuming 50% of sugar in 6-7 days and finishing fermentation after 10 days (Fig. 1A). Control (aerobic) ferments solely inoculated with S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 produced similar ethanol concentration than the anaerobic control and showed higher concentrations of acetic and malic acids than other ferments. Ferments inoculated with P. kudriavzevii AWRI1220 or Z. bailii AWRI1578 produced approximately 2% (v/v) lower ethanol concentration than the S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 anaerobic control. Interestingly, the production of glycerol or organic acids by these two strains did not balance the carbon diverted away from ethanol production (Table 3). T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 ferments had an ethanol concentration lower than the S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 anaerobic control and higher glycerol and succinic acid concentrations than other strains. 3.3.2 Treatment II For Treatment II aeration (0.025 VVM) was only provided for the first 24 hours following inoculation at T0 with the non-Saccharomyces yeasts. Ferments inoculated with S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 and T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 had similar growth rates (Fig. 1B) and attained similar maximum optical densities (Fig. 2B). As for Treatment I, Z. bailii AWRI1578 ferments showed the highest maximum optical density. S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 ferments completed fermentation in 4 days, while T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 and Z. bailii AWRI1578 ferments completed fermentation after 6 and 15 days, respectively. Only ferments inoculated with P. kudriavzevii AWRI1220 did not complete fermentation within 15 days leaving 107 g/L of residual sugar. S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 ferments produced similar concentrations of ethanol and acetic, malic and succinic acids than the anaerobic control (Table 3). Ferments inoculated with T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 and Z. bailii AWRI1578 had approximately 1.5% (v/v) lower ethanol concentrations than S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 ferments. They also had a higher concentration of succinic acid than S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 anaerobic ferments. T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 sequential ferments had almost double the glycerol concentration of S. cerevisiae ferments. 3.3.3 Treatment III Treatment III aeration (0.025 VVM) was maintained until 50% of initial sugar was consumed. All fermentations went to completion. Aerobic ferments inoculated only with S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 completed fermentation after 4 days, P. kudriavzevii AWRI1220 in sequential ferments completed fermentation after 10 days, T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 sequential ferments completed fermentation in 5 days, and sequential ferments inoculated with Z. bailii AWRI1578 completed fermentation after 9 days (Fig. 1C). Yeast growth profiles were similar to those observed in previous treatments. Sequential ferments inoculated with P. kudriavzevii AWRI1220, T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 and Z. bailii AWRI1578 had 1.5% (v/v), 1.1% (v/v) and 1.2% (v/v) less ethanol, respectively than the anaerobic control (Table 3). 3.3.4 Treatment IV Treatment IV ferments were aerated at a rate of 0.05 VVM until 50% of the initial sugar was consumed by non-Saccharomyces strains. Ferments inoculated with S. cerevisiae AWRI1631, T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 and Z. bailii AWRI1578 had similar growth rates but reached different maximum optical densities and completed fermentation at different times (Figs. 1D and 2D). As observed for other treatments P. kudriavzevii AWRI1220 ferments had the lowest maximum optical density. While aerobic ferments inoculated solely with S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 completed fermentation in 4 days, sequential ferments with T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 and Z. bailii AWRI1578 completed fermentation in 6 and 7 days, respectively. Sequential inoculation with P. kudriavzevii AWRI1220 did not complete fermentation after 10 days leaving 53 g/L of residual sugar. Anaerobic ferments inoculated with S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 and with an increased gas sparging rate were used as controls. S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 ferments produced 1.9% (v/v) less ethanol and three times more acetic acid than the anaerobic control (Table 3). Ferments inoculated with T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 or Z. bailii AWRI1578 had similar ethanol concentrations, 1.6% (v/v) less than the anaerobic control. T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 and Z. bailii AWRI1578 ferments also had higher concentration of succinic acid than the control."
12,Discussion,"Unlike S. cerevisiae yeast, for which respiration is repressed by high concentrations of hexoses even in the presence of oxygen, many non-Saccharomyces yeast are able to aerobically respire sugar (Alexander and Jeffries, 1990; de Deken, 1966), thereby metabolising sugars without the concomitant production of ethanol. This provides a potential avenue to explore for reducing the ethanol content of wine. Air addition to grape must during fermentation is a common practice in winemaking. For example, aerobic pump-overs and macro oxygenation techniques are frequently used to shape the aroma, taste and colour of some wine varieties (Vidal et al., 2001, 2003, 2004; Vivas and Glories, 1996). These practices increase oxygen availability thereby influencing yeast metabolism (Fornairon-Bonnefond et al., 2003; Rosenfeld et al., 2003), potentially enabling partial aerobic metabolism of sugars, leading to reduced generation of ethanol. While nine of 48 strains screened in this work consumed reasonable amounts of sugar and gave ethanol yields substantially lower than the S. cerevisiae control fermentation, strains from species previously described as Crabtree negative did not; K. lactis AWRI1181 showed some potential but results for the other strains were not encouraging, at least under the conditions studied. The ‘Crabtree phenotype’ of these species was originally determined using a high level of aeration (ranging from 0.5 to 5 VVM), vigorous agitation (up to 700 rpm) and moderate sugar concentration (up to 26 g/L) (Bellaver et al., 2004; González Siso et al., 1996; Postma et al., 1989; Venturin et al., 1995; Zeeman et al., 2000). Aeration in the current study (0.025 VVM and agitation 120 rpm) was possibly insufficient to trigger respiration on these strains. However, whilst introducing increased levels of oxygen might enable aerobic respiration in these yeasts, in winemaking this would lead to oxidation, colour degradation, and the synthesis of off-flavours (Salmon, 2006) and therefore would not be an option for winemakers. In subsequent aerobic sequential trials, fermentations involving three of the 12 non-Saccharomyces strains (Torulaspora delbrueckii AWRI1152, Pichia kudriavzevii AWRI1220 and Zygosaccharomyces bailii AWRI1578) led to reduced ethanol yields relative the S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 control and all three of these fermentations had little or no residual sugar (Table 2). Interestingly, seven of the 12 non-Saccharomyces strains tested in sequential fermentation trials were also identified in a previous study as potentially having a reduced ethanol yield under anaerobic conditions (Contreras et al., 2014). However, completed fermentations with reduced ethanol yields were not observed for these seven strains under both semi-aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Thus, the non-Saccharomyces strains chosen for further characterisation in the current work and in Contreras et al. (2014) were specifically selected for either semi-aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The best three performers from the above experiments, P. kudriavzevii AWRI1220, T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 and Z. bailii AWRI1578, were next evaluated in CDGJ medium using four different aeration regimes. Results from this experiment (Table 3) show that oxygen additions led to decreased ethanol concentrations even in control S. cerevisiae fermentations but the greatest decrease without impacting on acetic acid concentration was for sequentially inoculated fermentations using T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 and Z. bailii AWRI1578, both of which went to completion (>99% of sugar was utilised for all treatments). In contrast, sequentially inoculated P. kudriavzevii fermentations failed to finish in Treatments II and IV. This species has been described as stress-tolerant, exhibiting ethanol-, osmo-, and thermo-tolerance (Kitagawa et al., 2010), but it is reported to have a higher oxygen requirement than others yeasts such as S. cerevisiae (Lee et al., 2003). Whilst this might explain the poor fermentation activity observed for Treatment II (which had the lowest rate of aeration) further research will be required to explain its behaviour in Treatment IV (which had the highest rate of aeration) relative to Treatments I and III, both of which went to completion. Interestingly, yeast biomass (measured as OD600) was very low in all treatments even after sequential inoculation with S. cerevisiae. This suggests a potential inhibition of S. cerevisiae AWRI1631 growth by P. kudriavzevii AWRI1120. Ferments inoculated with T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 completed fermentation under all conditions and generated more glycerol in all treatments than the other yeasts. The highest glycerol concentration observed was for Treatment II. T. delbrueckii is an osmo-tolerant yeast able to increase the production and intracellular accumulation of glycerol in response to elevated external osmolarity (Bely et al., 2008; Blomberg and Adler, 1989, 1992; Myers et al., 1997). Previous studies have observed that aeration can decrease glycerol production due to reoxidation of NADH by respiration, whereas anaerobic conditions tend to increase glycerol production (Alves-Araujo et al., 2007; Ansell et al., 1997; Brandam et al., 2013; Merico et al., 2007; Rigoulet et al., 2004). Our results suggest that insufficient oxygen was present in these experiments to allow this yeast to completely reoxidise NADH by respiration. Ferments inoculated with T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 or Z. bailii AWRI1578 produced high concentrations of succinic acid. The highest concentration observed was found in ferments from Treatment II inoculated with Z. bailii AWRI1578. Z. bailii is known to produce high concentrations of succinic and acetic acids in winemaking conditions (Hutkins, 2006). Although succinic acid concentration in wine usually falls between 0.5-1.5 g/L, higher concentrations (up to 3.0 g/L) have been found for certain red wine varieties and are not considered necessarily detrimental for wine flavour (de Klerk, 2010; Peynaud and Blouin, 1996). Z. bailii is also able to consume malic acid (Saayman and Viljoen-Bloom, 2006) which is consistent with our findings; ferments inoculated with Z. bailii AWRI1578 showed the lowest malic acid concentration regardless of treatment. Although P. kudriavzevii has also been shown to metabolise malic acid (Kim et al., 2008; Seo et al., 2007), our results showed only a limited consumption of malic acid by P. kudriavzevii AWRI1120. Although aeration has been shown to decrease S. cerevisiae ethanol production this is typically associated with increased acetic acid yield (Quiros et al., 2014). Results from Treatment IV are consistent with this; compared to the anaerobic control, ethanol concentration was lower, while the concentration of acetic acid was considerably higher (>2.0 g/L). Acetic acid has a sour and bitter taste and concentrations higher than 0.9 g/L are considered detrimental for wine quality (Ribéreau-Gayon et al., 2006). Taking ethanol yield and production of acetic acid into account, T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 and Z. bailii AWRI1578 showed the greatest potential for production of wine with reduced ethanol concentration under limited aerobic conditions; over 2% (v/v) reductions, depending on aeration regime, compared to the anaerobic control. Further research is needed to establish whether this performance is reproducible in grape musts and how it impacts on wine flavour profile. Dissolved oxygen concentrations of 5 mg/L have been achieved in our laboratory during fermentation using the aeration conditions applied in this work (0.025 VVM, data not shown). This is similar to the maximum dissolved oxygen concentrations reported when using a Venturi during pump-over with large-scale fermentation vessels under winemaking conditions (Moenne et al., 2014). Therefore, it is feasible to provide enough oxygen during wine fermentation to influence the oxidative metabolism of T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 and Z. bailii AWRI1578 and reduce ethanol formation. Yeast from the Zygosaccharomyces genus have been associated with the spoilage of wine and of foods containing high concentrations of sugar, which includes grape juice (Domizio et al., 2011b; Rojo et al., 2015). Zygosaccharomyces yeasts are able to grow in these environments because of their high tolerance to preservatives and high resistance to several stresses (i.e. low pH, high osmolality). However, wine spoilage yeasts including Z. bailii have been shown to produce wine without any detrimental characteristics when used in mixed cultures with S. cerevisiae (Domizio et al., 2011b). In fact, wines produced with Z. bailii showed increased concentration of polysaccharides which are considered to exert a positive effect on the final wine. Considering these results it has been suggested to use Z. bailii as well as other potential spoilage yeasts in mixed started cultures to enhance wine quality (Domizio et al., 2011b). In summary, the work described in this paper demonstrates the potential of using non-Saccharomyces yeasts in fermentations supplied with small amounts of oxygen, to produce wines with reduced ethanol content. Since Treatments II and III are equally effective in decreasing ethanol concentration, one simple strategy to achieve a desirable outcome in real, industrial scale, winemaking situations might be to inoculate grape must first with either T. delbrueckii AWRI1152 or Z. bailii AWRI1578, supply small amounts of oxygen during the first half of fermentation and then finish the fermentation by inoculating with a wine strain of S. cerevisiae. If ethanol reductions in the order of about 2% (v/v) can be achieved at industrial scale, this will be a significant advance, particularly for winemakers sourcing grapes from warm, sunny regions in which high sugar accumulations are common. Future work will focus on scaling up experiments to pilot scale using red and white grape musts. It will also be of interest to trial an amalgamation of strategies described in this paper and previous publications (Contreras et al., 2014, 2015), all of which used non-conventional yeasts to reduce ethanol yields. If the effects of the different approaches are additive, or at least complementary, it should be possible to reduce ethanol yields considerably more than 2% (v/v)."
