0,Introduction,"Chitosan (CS) is a biopolymer that has been extensively studied owing to its inherent non-toxicity, biocompatibility and biodegradability in biomedical applications such as tissue engineering, wound dressings and drug delivery (Rath et al., 2015). It is well known that CS can easily be fabricated in different forms such as hydrogels (Furuike et al., 2017), films (Pandele et al., 2014) and nanofibers (Bösiger et al., 2018). Spinning CS into fibrous form has attracted widespread interest in fields such as tissue engineering, wound dressings and artificial skin. Fibrous biomaterials possess high porosity, high specific surface area and, specifically, close similarity to the architecture of the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) which serve as a platform for cell adhesion, migration and proliferation (Sedghi et al., 2016). Moreover, good biological properties of CS-based fibrous materials for bone regeneration has been studied using in vitro and in vivo tests (Zhang et al., 2015). Spinning methods are used to fabricate Fibrous CS materials including thermal-induced phase separation, molecular self-assembly and electrospinning. Compared with the other fiber-fabricating techniques, electrospinning has been recognized as an efficient and inexpensive technique to produce high pore volumes of sub-micron size polymer nanofibers with interconnected pores in nano-scale diameter similar to ECM to create natural tissue (Qin et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the ability of CS to be electrospun is generally limited. This limitation initiates from its cationic nature which leads to the formation of strong electrostatic interactions between the polymer chains that remarkably decrease the solution processability (Sedghi et al., 2016). Several studies show the successful preparation of CS-based nanofibers to improve the electrospinnability of CS via blending CS with other easy-electrospinnable polymers such as Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (Koosha and Mirzadeh, 2015), Polyethylene Oxide (PEO) (Dodero et al., 2020) and Polylactic acid (PLA) (Afshar et al., 2019). PVA is usually selected as a co-spinning agent due to its good spinnability, highly water solubility and high flexibility (Karimi et al., 2020). PVA is characterized by its biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, lack of toxicity and biodegradability. Thus, it is expected that nanofibers composed of chitosan/PVA (CS/PVA) blend which are produced by electrospinning are good candidates for biomedical applications (HasrulAkhmalNgadimana et al., 2015). Kheradmandi et al. (2016), proposed a CS/PVA nanofibrous scaffold for the reconstruction of skeletal muscle tissue. They have reported that CS/PVA nanofibrous scaffold showed good mechanical and biological responses when the scaffold was implanted into the leg muscle of a rabbit. Pangon et al. (2016) investigated the potential application of CS/PVA electrospun nanofibers with environment-friendly solvents as bone tissue engineering scaffolds. The results indicated that CS/PVA nanofibrous mats with succinic acid as a cost-effective eco-friendly solvent could significantly support osteoblast cells proliferation. CS/PVA nanofibers have numerous advantages including supporting tissue regeneration. However, the deprived mechanical properties of electrospun mats fabricated from CS/PVA restrict their exploitation in a wide range of applications (Marín et al., 2019). Moreover, numerous investigations revealed that electrically insulating of CS/PVA nanofibers constrains some of their biomedical applications such as cardiac and nerve tissue engineering (Martins et al., 2014).A variety of different methods such as cross-linking, blending and adding reinforcing fillers have been employed to overcome these shortcomings. There are researches in recent years which has focused on the incorporation of conductive nanomaterials to enhance electrical and mechanical properties of CS/PVA electrospun nanofibers. Abedi et al. (2019) designed CS/PVA electrospun scaffolds including the various amount of PEDOT:PSS (0.3, 0.6 and 1 wt%) for cardiac tissue engineering. The results showed that the addition of PEDOT:PSS to CS/PVA scaffolds made the electrical conductivity of CS/PVA/PEDOT:PSS scaffolds almost 100-times higher than pure CS/PVA. Meanwhile, the tensile strength and toughness of pure CS electrospsun nanofibers considerably improved by around 95% and 41%, respectively. In another study, Sambudi et al. (2015) explored the effect of the incorporation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticles on the mechanical properties of CS/PVA electrospun nanofibers and its biocompatibility for tissue engineering, particularly cartilage scaffolds. The results revealed that Young's modulus of CS/PVA/nano-CaCO3 electrospun nanofibers was enhanced by around 60 times while the ultimate strength of the fibers decreased almost 3 times. In addition, the scaffold contained 4 wt% CaCO3 shows more potential substrate for growing cells. In another study, Koosha et al. (2015) evaluated the mechanical properties of the CS/PVA nanofibours mats containing natural montmorillonite (MMT) nanoclays. They have determined that the Young's modulus and the ultimate tensile strength were significantly enhanced by increasing the nanoclay content in the electrospun mats. The same trend can be observed for the values of the toughness. The nanofibrous mats included nanoclay provide more appropriate environment for cell growth and attached which are suitable for biomedical applications. A comprehensive study considering the fabrication of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-based CS/PVA nanofiber scaffolds for cardiovascular tissue engineering was performed by Mombini et al., 2019. The main result was that the nanofiber containing 1 wt% of CNTs caused a 134% increase in Tensile strength and a 367% improvement of Elastic modulus. Meanwhile, the electrical conductivity of CS/PVA/1CNT scaffolds were 3.4 × 10−6 S/Cm which was close to the conductivity of the native myocardium. Cao et al. (2017) successfully dispersed Graphene Oxide (GO) nanosheets as nanofillers in a CS/PVA matrix to fabricate CS/PVA electrospun nanofibers. Their results represented that the incorporation of GO enhanced the total strength of fabricated nanofibers and the biocompatibility outcomes suggested that CS/GO (6 wt%) was more likely to utilize as an artificial cartilage implant. Graphene (Gr) is a two-dimensional layer of sp2 bonded carbon atoms packed in a hexagonal lattice structure, it has ultrahigh specific surface area, low cost, exceptional conductivity and two-dimensional geometry could be a better candidate as conductive fillers to improve the mechanical and electrical properties of fibers at remarkably lower Gr loading, compared to CNTs, conductive polymers and nanoclay additives (Ji et al., 2016). Nevertheless, there are crucial issues with Gr such as low rate of mass-production and high manufacturing cost (Francavilla et al., 2021). Moreover, in most reported Gr-based polymer nanocomposites, Gr is introduced through the solution-based reduction of dispersible GO (Barra et al., 2019). furthermore, the Gr fabrication in this method depended on a multi-step process composed of the reduction of GO and further dispersion of the following Gr before the synthesis of the polymer nanocomposite. Besides Chemical and physical reduction may be used for GO reduction if more steps are introduced to the polymer nanocomposite synthesis. These processes would reduce GO to electrically conductive Gr before mixing polymer have several defects. In the chemical reduction process to reduce GO to Gr, the exploitation of reducing agents like hydrazine (Ramazani and Karimi, 2016), sodium hydrosulphite (Liu et al., 2019) and hydroiodic acid in acetic acid (Wang et al., 2018) are typically prevalent. However, these reduction agent are highly toxic limits their use in large quantities so that careful washing protocols for biomaterial synthesis is mandatory (Murray et al., 2015). Hydrogen plasma and rapid thermal treatment methods related to the physical reduction were introduced to overcome the drawbacks of the chemical reduction method (Alotaibi et al., 2018) but very low-yielding and energy-intensive, cause difficulty in their use (Murray et al., 2015). Much study in recent years have been shown that graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), consist of several sheets of Gr with an overall thickness of approximately 2–18 nm for particular applications, retain the same outstanding characteristics of Gr. Moreover, GNPs are low cost and their large-scale synthesis is much easier compared with Gr (Francavilla et al., 2021). In addition, dispersion of GNPs is easier since during dispersion of Gr, the layers of Gr might be curled which is a drawback in comparison with GNPs(Bahiraei and Heshmatian, 2019). Because of the significant properties of GNPs, numerous investigations have utilized them for biomedical applications. For instance, Ginestra (2019) constructed Polycaprolactone/Graphene composite fibers by electrospinning for nerve tissue engineering scaffolds. Their study revealed that the 1 wt% GNPs incorporated in polycaprolactone matrix remarkably increased the ultimate tensile strength and Elastic Modulus of Polycaprolactone fiber from 1.46 ± 0.1 MPa and 5.6 ± 2 MPa to 3.48 ± 0.2 MPa and 21 ± 3 MPa, respectively. The resulting PCL-GNPs fibrous scaffolds are more likely be suitable for nerve tissue engineering or the treatment of cells. Golafshan et al. (2017) obtained hybrid GNPs/PVA/sodium alginate (SA) electrospun nanocomposite scaffolds revealing an excellent toughness and electrical conductivity nanocomposites compared with PVA/SA electrospun scaffolds which have impressive potential to manufacture substrates for peripheral nerve regeneration. Heidari et al. (2017) fabricated GNPs incorporated poly (caprolactone)/gelatin nanofibers by electrospinning technique. The main results outline that the tensile strength and Young's modulus of 1.5 wt% GNPs/poly (caprolactone)/gelatin enhanced by 117% and 128% respectively compared with poly (caprolactone)/gelatin nanofibers. The impedance of PCL/gelatin incorporated 1.5% Gr was 330 Ω which possessed approximate 11 times higher electrical conductivity over the PCL/gelatin matrix. Improvement mechanical and electrical characteristics beside the excellent biocompatibility of the electrospun GNPs/PCL/gelatin nanofibers could be respected as a turning point in tissue engineering scaffolds. In a later study, Yenier et al. (2016) performed an experimental study to examine the effect of the different GNPs loading (0–3 wt%) on the electrical and mechanical characteristics of the Chitosan film. Their study showed that loading of 1 wt% of GNPs would enhance tensile strength and Young modulus of CS film by 128% and 52% respectively. The surface resistivity of CS film filled with 1 wt% of GNPs decreased from 4.7 × 105 Ω/sq to 4.4 × 103 Ω/sq. in a recent study, kostopoulos et al. (2019) conducted experimental research to produce nano-modified electrospun polyetherimide (PEI) scaffolds included of a) GNPs, b) hydroxyapatite (HAP) and c) a blend of both nano-fillers using electrospinning method to mimic bone tissue. The obtained results determined that physical properties such as average diameter and porosity value of nano-modified electrospun scaffolds showed better performance than pure PEI electrospun scaffold. Also, all nano-modified electrospun scaffolds increased mechanical properties led them to be best options as bone tissue scaffolds. It is worth noting that to have an efficient reinforcement in Gr-based nanocomposites materials, it is vital to uniformly distribute Gr within the polymer matrix to produce strong bonding between nanocomposites components in the interface area (Phiri et al., 2018). However, Graphene is easily agglomerated caused by its large surface area and the strong van der waals forces. This property prevents a homogeneous distribution of Gr in the polymer matrix (Zhang et al., 2016). A lot of efforts have been made to improve the dispersibility of Gr. introducing a stabilizer such as a surfactant or aromatic molecules is more common to separate Gr layers by forming a thin film on the surface of Gr. Ultrasonic treatment is also common (Zhang et al., 2019). To the best of the authors’ knowledge and according to the comprehensive literature review on the effect of different reinforcement materials for enhancing the properties of CS-based nanofibers reveals that the scientific literature includes these disadvantages: (1) CNTs, conductive polymers and nanoclay additives are less effective than Gr-based nanofillers (2) the fabrication of polymer nanocomposites by Gr is expensive with the low fabrication rate (3) Gr introduced by reduction of GO possess toxic materials with low-yielding and energy-intensive (4) the electrical properties of Graphene/Chitosan nanocomposite fibers were not sufficiently carried out in the previous works. In this study, electrically conductive and flexible electrospun nanofibers are proposed by employing Graphene nanoplatelets as nanofillers in the Chitosan/PVA matrix with a wide range of composition using electrospinning technique. Moreover, the influence of the Graphene nanoplatelets concentration on the properties of the nanocomposite fibers is analyzed. It is envisioned that the offered GNPs-CP electrospun might have great potential to develop scaffolds for different tissue, particularly nerve regeneration. The main objectives and novelties of present study may be summarized as: • To improve the physical, mechanical and electrical conductivity of Chitosan/PVA electrospun nanofibers reinforcing by GNPs • To determine the most suitable parameters of the electrospinning process such as voltage, flow rate and the Chitosan/PVA volume ratio. • To investigate and compare the structure and diameter of the electrospun nanofibers under the presence of different content of GNPs (0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 wt%) • To assess the distribution of GNPs as reinforcement materials in the CP matrix • To perform the Cross-linking process to stabilize the morphology of nanofibers and inhibit the dissolution of polymeric chains in culture media • To analyze the chemical interactions between GNPs and CP • To evaluate the effect of GNPs on the crystallization behavior of CP matrix • To determine specific surface area and pore size distribution • To examine the effect of various GNPs on mechanical and electrical characteristics of electrospun nanofibers before and after crosslinking."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Material,"2.1 Material Chitosan (powder, medium molecular weight, degree of deacetylation, DD% = 80%), Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, Mw = 72,000), Acetic acid, Glutaraldehyde (GA), Propanol, ethanol and Triton X-100™ were purchased from Merck and Sigma-Aldrich Co, respectively. Research grade Graphene nanoplatelets (Purity >99.5%, Thickness: 2–18 nm with less than 32 Layers) used in this research were provided from Nanosany Corporation. Deionized water was used in the different parts of this study."
3,Fabrication of GNPs-CP nanocomposite fibers,"2.2 Fabrication of GNPs-CP nanocomposite fibers The current investigation involved preparing and analyzing GNPs-CP nanocomposite fibers with various GNPs loadings to measure the changes in the properties of Chitosan/PVA nanofibers. Initially, Chitosan was dissolved by 2% Acetic acid aqueous solution at room temperature with gentle magnetic stirring for 24 h to form 3 wt% homogenous solution of Chitosan. At the same time, GNPs, according to the total weight of Chitosan and PVA, were added in 0.5 wt% aqueous Triton x-100 solution to improve compatibility and dispersion of GNPs within the polymer matrix. The mixture then was constantly stirred for 1 h by a magnetic heating stirrer at room temperature. Afterwards, GNPs suspension was immediately exposed to an ultrasonic bath for 30 min to improve GNPs distribution in polymer suspension. Shortly after, 22 wt% of PVA was slowly and carefully added to GNPs suspension and then was firmly stirred with a magnetic heating stirrer at 80 °C for 5 h. Subsequently, 3 wt% Chitosan solution was added to GNPs-PVA suspension and gently stirred with a magnetic heating stirrer at ambient temperature for 72 h. Finally, just before the electrospinning process, the polymer suspensions were sonicated by an ultrasonic probe (WUDD10H, Power 770 W) for 15 min. By doing this step, a homogenous dispersion of GNPs obtained (Fig. 1 A). By this GNPs content in GNPs-CP, we followed the procedure that the concentration of GNPs in CS/PVA solution went up to an extent until electrospinning of nanofibers with uniform morphology was possible. The maximum concentration of GNPs was 5 wt%, beyond this concentration spinning of the controlled nanofiber structure was limited due to syringe blockage. Therefore, the GNPs concentration of 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 wt% were selected. It is worth noting that the concentration of Chitosan and PVA was selected according to design experiments to track electrospinning parameters. In the electrospinning process, different parameters have a profound impact on the morphology of the electrospun nanofibers as well as the diameter of the nanofibers. The most important of these parameters are voltage, flow rate, the tip to the collector distance, the polymer concentration and the weight ratio of polymers. In this study, we designed and performed various experiments (experiments were not shown in this paper) to obtain the important parameters of the electrospinning process. After each electrospun experiment to reach to a suitable sample (i.e., to have an appropriate diameter and the lowest beads rate) samples were studied by SEM. Eventually, the obtained parameters were as follows: • Chitosan concentration: 3 wt% • PVA concentration: 22 wt% • Voltage: 20 KV • Flow rate: 0.5 mL h−1 • The tip to the collector distance: 15 cm • The weight ratio of Chitosan/PVA was characterized in section 3.1 of the results Moreover, the spinning temperature was 24–25 °C and the relative humidity was 53%–58%. In this research prepared suspension was inserted into a 3 mL syringe with a 22 Gauge needle and also GNPs concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 wt %) were selected as variable parameters (Fig. 1A). The fabricated fibrous nanocomposites with a supporting aluminium foil were dried in a vacuum desiccator at room temperature. The crosslinking process was performed by immersing the nanocomposites fibers in a solution comprising propanol/water 95:5, 0.01 M HCl and 2% (vol/vol) GA for 16 h. The samples were then taken away and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C, and unreacted GA was neutralized by immersion into 0.2 M glycine solution overnight. The samples were then washed thoroughly in PBS and dried (Fig. 1A)."
4,Characterization of GNPs-CP nanocomposites fibers,"2.3 Characterization of GNPs-CP nanocomposites fibers In the electrospinning, the parameters related to the surface morphology such as the diameter of fibers, porous structure and defects like beads were characterized using SEM (Philips, XL30) (the specimens were investigated before and after crosslinking process). The average diameter of the nanofibers was analyzed with Image J software, in such a way that at a specified magnification, from the selected SEM image, the diameter of 50–100 nanofibers was randomly measured. Finally, the average amount of nanofibers was calculated and pointed out as mean ± SD. Moreover, a Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Zeiss EM10C) was performed to evaluate the dispersion of GNPs in the CS/PVA fibers. The specimen was directly placed on a carbon-coated copper grid for TEM. The characterization of the molecular structure of the nanofibers was verified through Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR, Bruker tensor). It was carried out over a range of 600–4000 cm−1 and also the pure sample of Chitosan, PVA and GNPs were analyzed by ATR-FTIR. The crystalline structure of CP and GNPs-CP nanocomposite fibers were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD, X0 Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer, Phillips, Netherlands) technique carried out with CuKα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The specific surface area and pore size distribution of CP and 1GNPs-CP electrospun nanofibers were obtained using The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) techniques. The BET method is established on physical adsorption and desorption of N2 gas on the surface of the sample. CP and 1GNPs-CP nanofibers were degassed under vacuum for 48 h at room temperature. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were recorded using a TriStar II, Micrometrics instruments. Prior to the electrospinning process, the electrical properties of electrospun precursor solutions were calculated at room temperature (n = 5) using a laboratory conductivity meter apparatus. Electrical conductivity (after and before crosslinking) of electrospun nanofibers was determined using a Keithley-2601A multimeter. Nanofiber sheets with a diameter of 50 μm were applied a voltage range between 10 and -10 V using two electrodes with a width of 1 cm, and the current was recorded (n = 3). The conductivity values were measured from the (I–V) curve. Mechanical properties of electrospun nanocomposite fibers (after and before crosslinking) were characterized using a tensile tester machine (Instron-3367) which is operated with a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min under ambient temperature circumstances. The specimens for the tensile test were cut into dumbbell shapes with 5 mm × 30 mm × 0.01 mm dimensions. The tensile test was carried out by a tensile tester machine with a speed of 1 mm/min and 25 °C to the rupture point. After plotting the stress-strain curves, the mechanical properties consisting of tensile strength, strain at break, toughness and Young modulus were measured."
5,Statistical analysis,"2.4 Statistical analysis The resulted data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA analyses and reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The p-value for statistical significance is defined as p ˂0.05. To determine a statistically, significant difference between groups, Tukey's post-hoc test using Originpro Software with a P-value <0.05 was applied to be significant."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Fabrication and characterization of the hybrid nanofibers,"3.1 Fabrication and characterization of the hybrid nanofibers It was apparent beforehand that a reduction in the diameter of nanofibers would be a desirable outcome, particularly for the biomedical applications. Nanofibers with lower diameter cause higher surface area and therefore result in developing biological properties such as cell attachment and proliferation as well as drug loading (Zhang et al., 2015). It is essential that the weight ratio of Chitosan and PVA to be calculated before GNPs adding according to the setups of electrospinning experiments (materials and methods 2.2) in an attempt to produce nanofibers with the appropriate quality of the structure and a bead-free and uniform morphology. The SEM images of CP nanofibers including the different amounts of chitosan (40, 30, 20and 10 v/v) are illustrated in Fig. 2 A-D. The polycationic behavior of CS in solution entirely restricts the ability of CS to be spinable (Sedghi et al., 2016). To improve the electrospinability of CS, PVA has proven to be an appropriate candidate (Karimi et al., 2020). As can be seen in Fig. 2, the addition of PVA to Chitosan solution brought about uniform architecture and homogenous pores in 30%chitosan-PVA nanofibers (Fig. 2B) due to the excellent spinnability of PVA (Golafshan et al., 2017). However, the more addition of PVA to the chitosan solution led to more thick and fused fibers (Fig. 2C and D) due to the hydrophilic nature of PVA which causes to remain solvent after electrospinning (Sedghi et al., 2016). Moreover, the average diameter of nanofibers increased with the addition of PVA (P˂0.05) (Fig. 2E). It could be due to the solution concentration increments contributing to increasing solution viscosity (Dodero et al., 2020). The CS-PVA volume ratio of 30:70 was selected as the polymer matrix for further experiments because these nanofibers are uniform and smooth with appropriate sizes. Therefore, GNPs with a thickness of 2–18 nm, 99.5% Graphene purity, the diameter of 4–12 μm and Volume Resistivity: 4 × 10−4 Ω cm (Fig. 1B and C) were incorporated inside CP solution to create GNPs-CP nanocomposite fibers consisting of various amounts of GNPs (0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 wt%). The inherent characteristics of polymer solutions like electrical conductivity and polymer viscosity may have a profound impact on the electrospinning process as well as fiber formation (Kalantari et al., 2019). The results obtained in previous studies (Ginestra, 2019) indicated that the formation of electrospun nanofiber was mainly influenced by the Gr content. Based on analysis of the SEM images (Fig. 3 A and B and Fig. 4 A-C), a uniform bead-free structure was observed for nanofibers with GNPs even at high GNPs loading (5GNPs-CP) due to relatively good dispersion of GNPs resulting from strong interactions between GNPs and polymer matrix. TEM image of 1GNPs-CP electrospun nanofibers is shown in Fig. 3E which confirmed homogenous dispersion of GNPs within the CP matrix. However, some GNPs were also visible outside of the nanofibers. TEM image of 1GNPs-CP nanocomposite fibers reported with higher magnification (insets in Fig. 3E) also indicated mono-dispersion of GNPs within CP matrix with 94 ± 12 nm size of GNPs. A good dispersion of the GNPs results from favorable interfacial interaction between GNPs and CP matrix. Our findings are consistent with the results presented by (Pandele et al., 2014). They have found that 0.5 and 1 wt% of GO sheets were homogenously dispersed within the Chitosan-PVA matrix without any aggregations. Prior study has documented that the incorporation of higher Gr content (˃1 wt%) in the electrospun Chitosan-PVA fibers causes bead-like defects in fibers (Marín et al., 2019). However, our results revealed that the formation of smooth and bead-free morphology in 2GNPs-CP and 5GNPs-CP nanofibers confirms a relatively homogenous distribution of GNPs up to 5 wt%. The average diameter of electrospun nanofibers was extracted from SEM images (Fig. 3F) with image J software. As observed in Fig. 3F, increasing GNPs content upon 1 wt% the average fiber diameter tended to reduce and then fairly increased. The average fibre diameter of 1GNPs-CP was 144 ± 18 nm, which was substantially smaller than pure CP nanofibers 370 ± 40 nm (P ˂ 0.05). The reduction fiber size could be the result of GNPs incorporation which causes higher electrical conductivity of the precursor solution (Table 1 ). The higher electrostatic force in the electrospinning process is generally attributed to the rise in the conductivity of polymeric solution resulting in the higher tensile force when exposed to an applied voltage and eventually the lower diameter of nanofibers (Mahmoudi and Simchi, 2017). The conductivity of CP suspensions considerably enhanced after GNPs loading up to 1799 ± 11 μS (at 1GNPs-CP precursor suspension) which could be due to the formation of a physical 3D structure of GNPs in the polymer solution, which is ideal for charge transfer in the solution. Similar literature reported the enhancement in the electrical conductivity by increasing Gr content (Heidari et al., 2017). In our work, after an increase in electrical conductivity up to 1.0% GNPs content, a slight reduction was observed for higher GNPs content. This reduction in electrical conductivity is probably due to the aggregation of GNPs. According to this phenomenon, there is a percolation threshold that creates a physical 3D structure acting as a bridge for electrical conductivity. At Gr concentrations higher than the percolation threshold, Gr layers tend to aggregate and show a phase separation from the polymer solution, which reversely affects electrical conductivity (Zheng et al., 2019). Based on the experimental results the percolation threshold of this study was around 0.5 wt% of GNPs which adds a bit more GNPs, results in the fairy improvement of conductivity. These results are compatible with the observation of (Golafshan et al., 2017). They have shown that the average fiber size of Alginic acid sodium salt and PVA (AP) nanofibers scaffold contained 1 wt% of Gr nanosheets was 296 ± 40 nm and remarkably lower than neat AP scaffolds, which was approximate 404 nm. It might be due to the incorporation of Gr nanosheets leading to the higher conductivity of the precursor suspension. However, our findings are in contradiction to (Marín et al., 2019) results. They have illustrated that the average diameter of chitosan-PVA electrospun fibers increased with the addition of GO. The average diameter of electrospun fibers contained 0.5 and 1 wt% of GO is 152.94 and 202.79 nm respectively. It is higher than 144.45 nm for chitosan-PVA electrospun fibers. It could be attributed to increasing of the viscosity of the electrospinning solution with the addition of GO. It appears that Graphene and GNPs have shown a considerable effective role in the reduction of fiber size than GO nanosheets for nanocomposite fibers. Fig. 3(C and D) and Fig. 4D-F present SEM images and the average diameter of cross-linked nanofibers. In the cross-linking process, Glutaraldehyde (GA) was used as a cross-linker to react free functional groups of –OH and –NH2 with aldehyde group to obtain CN and hemiacetal groups acting as cross-link functional groups to stabilize morphology of nanofibers and inhibit dissolution of polymeric chains in culture media (Bösiger et al., 2018). The Cross-linking process was performed in water/propanol/GA media under acidic conditions. The presence of propanol prohibits excess water uptake and expansion of electrospun nanofibers (Khorshidi et al., 2016). According to SEM images of cross-linked nanofibers, the fibrous structure and porosity of the nanofibers were preserved. Despite maintaining fibrillary and porosity, the cross-linking process had an increasing effect on the diameter of nanofibers. Particularly, the average diameter of 0.5GNPs-CP nanocomposite fibers substantially enhanced from 169 ± 64 nm to 258 ± 38 nm (P˂0.05) that might be the consequence of swelling of fibers through the cross-linking process (Khorshidi et al., 2016). The trend associated with the diameter of nanofibers observed in untreated GNPs-CP nanofibers was also repeated in cross-linked samples, which is due to the dispersion of GNPs up to 1.0 wt% and aggregation of the GNPs for higher concentrations."
8,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR),"3.2 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to analyze functional groups of the electrospun fibers and the effect of interactions between functional groups. Fig. 5 A, B presents the FTIR spectrum of chitosan, PVA, GNPs powder as well as all nanocomposites. According to Fig. 5B, Amino (-NH2) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups show absorption in the range of 3200–3400 c m − 1 , and 3200–3500 c m − 1 , respectively. Stretching vibration of the C–H bond shows an absorption in the range of 2820–2930 c m − 1 . The peak available at 1740 c m − 1 is due to the presence of residual carbonyl group acetyl functional group of chitosan. The peaks at 1599, 1645, 1083, and 1156 c m − 1 are due to the presence of N–H bending vibrations of amide II, stretching vibrations of the carbonyl group of amide I, stretching vibrations of C–O of chitosan and glycoside bond (C–O–C), respectively, these are in good agreement with the results have been documented by (Dodero et al., 2020). In the FTIR spectrum of PVA, stretching vibrations of OH, and stretching vibration of carbonyl groups of residual acetate show absorptions at 3433, and 1736 c m − 1 , respectively (Nor HasrulAkhmalNgadimana, AniIdris, MuhammadIrfan, Denni Kurniawana, NoordinMohdYusofa, 2015). GNPs show weak absorptions in a few regions, indicating the presence of a few residual functional groups which improve the dispersion of GNPs in the CP matrix (Teodoro et al., 2019). Stretching vibrations of –OH and –NH groups are sensitive to hydrogen bonding extent so their absorption bands move to lower frequencies. Blending PVA and chitosan increases hydrogen bonding extent and stretching vibrations of –OH and –NH moves to 3326 c m − 1 . The peak available at 1145 c m − 1 indicates crystallization of PVA and disappeares by blending with chitosan. The change in the positions of peaks responsible for hydrogen bonding to lower frequencies is a sign of increased interaction between the blended polymers (Yu et al., 2017). The interaction between fillers and the CP matrix was investigated, and the outcomes are illustrated in Fig. 5B. The ATR-FTIR reveals typical peaks of polymer blend in all nanocomposites. The peak corresponding to –C-OH (around 1089 cm−1) and the characteristic of hydroxyl band (around 3326 cm−1) reported to lower wavenumber as the GNPs content increase to 1Gr-CP (Fig. 5B), indicating the existence of hydrogen bonding between the –OH in the CP matrix and the remaining oxygen-functional groups in GNPs. In addition to the hydrogen bond, the interionic electrostatic interaction also formed. The peak position of carboxyl C–O stretch at 1428 cm−1 shifts to lower wavenumbers (Fig. 5B). It could be due to the coordinating of the residual carboxylated groups in GNPs and –NH3 + ions of CS in nanofibers (Ji et al., 2016). However, further addition of GNPs (5GNPs-CP) causes the GNPs restack that led to interruption of the typical arrangement of the CP chains which was similarly reported to previous researches (Golafshan et al., 2017)."
9,X-ray diffraction analysis,"3.3 X-ray diffraction analysis To analyze the effect of GNPs on the crystallization behavior of the polymer blend, x-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on samples with different GNPs content. Fig. 6 shows X-ray diffraction of nanocomposites GNPs/CP for different GNPs content. The outcomes of TEM and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy (Figs. 3 and 5) supported XRD patterns. Before electrospinning, the typical peaks of as-received PVA crystalline structure were observed at 2θ of 10.8°, 15.4°, 18.7°, 19.3° and 22.2°. The crystalline structure of PVA is indicated by these peaks (Koosha and Mirzadeh, 2015). CS powder exhibited crystalline peaks at 2θ of 12.4° and 20.2° (Koosha and Mirzadeh, 2015). After blending CS and PVA, all peaks associated with the as-received CS and PVA were disappeared and only one broad peak can be seen at around 2θ ∼ 20.5° due to the formation of hydrogen bonding between CS and PVA. This also demonstrate the interaction between two polymers and a more amorphous morphology. The results reported in the (Golafshan et al., 2017) study confirmed that the crystalline structure of the PVA/Alginic acid sodium salt blend was altered after the electrospinning process which could be the cause of the fact that the time scale of the solvent evaporation in the electrospinning process was rather less than the time scale of crystal formation so that, the crystallization of polymer chains was not observed in electrospinning samples. XRD pattern of different GNPs contents nanocomposites located at the same 2θ of CP nanofibers at 2θ = 20.5° (Fig. 6). the peak of XRD pattern of Gr as layered nanoparticle exhibited at 10.24 (Karimi et al., 2020) which was disappeared in GNPs-CP nanofibers demonstrating the loss of structure regularity of the GNPs. These results suggest that GNPs are uniformly dispersed and exfoliated in the CP matrix as can be confirmed in TEM images. In addition, intensity of the diffraction peak at 2θ = 20.5° slightly enhanced by increasing of GNPs loading up to 2% (2GNPs-CP). However, intensity of this peak sharply increases in 5GNPs-CP nanocomposites, and a new peak observed at 2θ = 26.6°. It may be inferred that the exfoliated and well-dispersed GNPs operate as nucleation sites to develop the crystallinity of the nanocomposite fibers which was similarly indicated in previous papers (Tian et al., 2014). Despite previous works that the crystallinity of the composites declined at high Gr content due to agglomeration and reduction of the surface area. in our study the outcomes illustrated a sharp rise in the crystallinity of high Gr loading composites (5GNPs-CP). It might be due to the presence of dispersed GNPs along with GNPs aggregates for this concentration. In fact, at 5.0 wt% GNPs content the possibility of the presence of GNPs in the whole matrix increases which improves distribution. However, the dispersion may not be ideal. The presence of a high amount of dispersed and aggregated GNPs together results in the presence of more nucleating sites which leads to a sharp peak at 5GNPs-CP."
10,BET analysis,"3.4 BET analysis The introduction of GNPs endowed the CP matrix with a unique structure which could remarkably improve the specific surface area. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms with the corresponding pore-size distribution for CP and 1GNPs-CP are shown in Figss. 7–10 . As can be seen, the isotherms of CP and 1GNPs-CP are the type IV adsorption isotherm with micropores which present hysteresis loop at a relative pressure P/P0 ˃ 0.4, indicated that both samples possess a typical mesoporours (2–50 nm pore diameter) structure. 1GNPs-CP nanofibers show more width hysteresis compared to CP nanofibers, indicating that 1GNPs-CP nanofibers are more mesoporous than CP nanofibers. this finding is in line with previous studies about the porosity of electrospun nanofibers (Wu et al., 2020). The results of BET surface area and BJH pore volume of CP and 1GNPs-CP are listed in Table 2 . According to Table 2, BET specific area increased for 1GNPs-CP nanofibers, 260.71 m2/g, relative to the pure nanofibers, 236.37 m2/g, due to the addition of GNPs with high surface area to the CP matrix (Mahmoudi and Simchi, 2017). BJH pore volume enhances from 0.3795 cm3 g−1 for CP nanocomposites fibers to 0.4497 cm3 g−1 for 1GNPs-CP. The incorporation of well-dispersed GNPs in CP solution increases its surface charge resulting in smaller electrospun fibers which could be the reason for higher volume pores of 1GNPs-CP nanocomposite fibers. According to the BJH method, the average size of the mesopores is 6.22 nm for CP electrospun nanofibers and 5.3 nm for 1GNPs-CP electrospun nanofibers. The outcomes of specific surface area, pore size and volume of 1GNPs-CP allows mass transport and support the growth and proliferation and migration of cells (Li et al., 2018). These fundings related to 1GNPs-CP electrospun nanofibers make it a better candidate for tissue engineering scaffolds rather than CP elctrospun nanofibers."
11,Electrical conductivity analysis,"3.5 Electrical conductivity analysis Electrical conductivity analyses were performed on dried nanofibers. Electrode distance and sample diameter were kept at 1 cm and 50 μ m , respectively (for any variation in sample diameter, L/A was kept constant at 103 M−1). By considering these parameters, conductivity was calculated according to equation (1): 1 σ = G . L / A σ (S/cm), L (cm), A (cm2), G (S) represent conductivity, the distance between two electrodes and the surface area of electrodes, respectively. The electrical conductivity of the samples is listed in Table 3 : The electrical conductivity of the graphene/polymer nanocomposite is affected by permeation threshold and was calculated by equation (2), as below: 2 σ = σ 0 ( ρ − ρ c ) t σ 0 , ρ , ρ c , and t are inherent conductivity of nanoparticle, volume density, permeation threshold concentration, and a universal critical parameter related to the dimension of the conductive network, respectively. According to the results, the permeation threshold concentration of GNPs was around 0.5 wt%, which enabled electron tunneling through nearby nanosheets. Table 3 presents the data obtained from conductivity measurement analysis of nanocomposite nanofibers calculated by using equation (1). Increasing GNPs content caused a dramatic increase in electrical conductivity of CP nanofibers, specifically in the incorporation of 1 wt% GNPs, (from 0.265 ± 0.032 × 10−5 to 0.1095 ± 0.0022 × 10−1 s/m) related to the formation of a 3D network of GNPs, until ideal dispersion was obtained and for higher GNPs concentrations (2 and 5 wt% GNPs), aggregation of GNPs resulted in a slight decrease in electrical conductivity (Fig. 11 ). For 5.0 wt% concentration of GNPs in the CP matrix, there was an increase in conductivity relative to the sample with 2.0 wt% GNPs. The reason for this phenomenon can be the presence of dispersed GNPs along with GNPs aggregates for this concentration (Golafshan et al., 2017). Engagement of GNPs with polymer chains can reduce aggregation of GNPs and act as an entropic barrier against clustering of GNPs, forcing them to be stable and dispersed. Increasing GNPs to higher contents results in clustering and aggregation. Phase separation of GNPs results in absence of GNPs all over the polymer matrix and increasing GNPs content up to 5.0 wt% increases the possibility of the presence of GNPs in the whole matrix which improves distribution but dispersion may not be ideal. The presence of dispersed and aggregated GNPs together results in the formation of a 3D structure and improves electrical conductivity. Injected electrons by electrodes move through solvation by ionic molecules and movement of these charged ions by formed electric field or moving through a physical network of GNPs increases electron movement efficiency. The combination of these two mechanisms and synergistic effect can further increase electrical conductivity by jumping of solvated electrons through conductive electrons. Research in graphene/polymer nanocomposites has been increased recently. Golafshan et al. prepared an electrospun scaffold of PVA/Sodium Alginate/Graphene nanocomposite and the permeation threshold was reported to be 0.5 wt%. This group reported a decrease in electroconductivity of the scaffolds for graphene contents higher than 1.0 wt%. It is worth noting that Electrical conductivity inherent in GNPs make them an ideal nanofillers in polymer-nanocomposites. The recent research shows that electrical stimulation can enhance the growth and proliferation of electro-responsive cells like nerve and muscle cells. The electrical conductivity of nerve tissues was reported in the range of 8 × 10−4 - 4 × 10−2 S/M due to the difference in measurement methods. The conductivity of native cardiac tissue was reported between 1.9 × 10−2 – 2 × 10−2 s/m (Abedi et al., 2019). The conductivity of nanofibers having 1.0 wt% GNPs, with electrical conductivity of 1 × 10−2 S/M, is close to the required conductivity for nerve and cardiac regeneration so that 1GNPs-CP electrospun nanofibers can be introduced as nerve or cardiac tissue scaffolds. Conductivity values were measured for cross-linked electrospun nanofibers with various contents of GNPs. Cross-linked nanocomposite fibers showed electrical conductivity values close to the one belongs to non-crosslinked nanocomposite fibers."
12,Mechanical properties of the electrospun nanofibers,"3.6 Mechanical properties of the electrospun nanofibers The tensile test was performed on the prepared CS/PVA thin films with and without GNPs after and before crosslinking according to ASTM D882, to calculate the tensile strength, elongation at break, stiffness and toughness (see aFig. 12 ). Table 4 shows the mechanical properties of nanocomposite fibers before crosslinking. As can be seen, the incorporation of GNPs significantly improves the mechanical behaviors of the nanofibers. The strength of the CP electrospun nanofibers was 3.34 ± 0.5 MPa and 10.3 ± 2.4 and 11 ± 1.1 MPa for the 0.5 GNPs-CP and 1GNPs-CP nanofibers respectively (P ˂ 0.05) and also compared to CP nanofibers the elongation at break of 1GNPs-CP and 2GNPs-CP considerably increased (approximate 130% and 230% respectively) from 6.7 ± 2.1 to 15.5 ± 3.2 and 22 ± 4.6%. Our study is in good agreement with (Cao et al., 2017). They reported that the tensile strength of chitosan/PVA with 0.4 and 0.6 wt% GO electrospun nanofibers were about 2.78 and 1.81 MPa, respectively which was considerably smaller than our findings (0.5GNPs-CP). The elongations at break of 0.4 and 0.6 wt% of GO nanofibers were also 16.79% and 32.82% respectively. This is probably attributed to the less defects in the carbon network and interlayer spacing reduction between GNPs and CS matrix which led to the significantly stronger reinforcement behavior of GNPs and RGO than GO (Phiri et al., 2018). Such a simultaneous improvement in ductility and strength for GNPs-based nanofibers are attributed to the intrinsic properties of GNPs, the homogeneity of nanocomposites and the interfacial interaction between GNPs and polymer matrix. The functional groups of CP molecular chains interact with the residual oxygen functional groups on the plane and edge of GNPs to form strong hydrogen and electrostatic bonds acting as an interfacial load transfer region between the CP matrix and GNPs. However, more incorporation of GNPs (5GNPs-CP) results in a relative reduction of elongation at break (12.85 ± 5.8) which is consistent with results obtained in the previous studies (Ceretti et al., 2017). It is attributed to the formation of micron-sized agglomerates in GNPs-CP electrospun nanofibers and the poor distribution of GNPs in the CP matrix (Yenier et al., 2016). A prior study (Wang et al., 2019) indicated that Gr and Gr derivatives may not only improve the strength of the polymer nanocomposites but also increase the toughness of the polymer matrix. Table 4 shows Young's module and toughness of CP nanofibers with different GNPs content. Compared to CP nanofibers, the toughness of 1GNPs-CP and 2GNPs-CP nanofibers substantially increased (12 and 21-fold, respectively) from 6.02 ± 1.3 to 73.9 ± 5.2 MPa and 130.9 ± 4.3, respectively (P˂0.05). this is in line with results obtained in previous studies (Geng et al., 2020). This might lead to the highly flexible structure of GNPs and the interfacial ionic and hydrogen bonds between GNPs and CP matrix leads to effectively energy dissipation applied to the CS-PVA molecules during the tensile stress loading process. Furthermore, incorporation of 0.5 wt% and 1 wt% GNPs prominently improves Young's Modulus from 0.282 ± 0.018 to 2.09 ± 0.16 MPa for 0.5GNPs-CP and also a 10-fold improvement for 1GNPs-CP in comparison to CP nanofibers, which is in good agreement with (Li et al., 2018). Chen et al. have documented that the incorporation of different content of GO in chitosan nanofibers slightly increased the tensile strength and Young's modulus by approximate 2 and 3 times, respectively. However, this study reported a slight improvement of tensile strength and Young's modulus which was considerably lower than our finding. In this study, approximately 10-fold increase in Young's modulus was obtained in just 0.5 wt% of GNPs content. It could be attributed to the presence of well-dispersed GNPs in the CP matrix which provides a strong resistance pillar for the movement or displacement of the CP chains and the presence of strong interaction confirmed by FTIR and XRD patterns. Nevertheless, the addition of GNPs more than 2 wt% attributed to a noticeable decrement of Young's module and toughness. Liu et al., 2014 was constructed chitosan-graphene oxide fibrous scaffolds producing by wet spinning. The findings of our work are compatible with their results at GO concentration 4 wt%. The rapid reduction of mechanical properties might be due to the aggregation of GNPs resulted from van der Waals force of nanosheets at high GNPs content hindering proper load transfer and uniform dispersion of GNPs (Ginestra, 2019). Although, some limitations are worth noting. Although GNPs-CP nanofibers have gained enormous interest in tissue engineering scaffolds due to the hydrophilic nature of CP nanofibers, nanofibers dissolve in culture media. Therefore, cross-linking treatment was used to stabilize morphology of nanofibers and inhibit dissolution of polymeric chains in culture media and resulted in appropriate scaffolds. Electrospun nanofibers were cross-linked and floated in PBS for an hour before performing a tensile test. The tensile strength was improved by almost 4 times and the young's modulus was approximate 9 times higher than the as-spun CP nanofibers. It could be attributed to the formation of strong covalent bonds between CP nanofibers and Glutaraldehyde (Salzano de Lunaa et al., 2019). The toughness of crs-CP nanofibers, compared to CP nanofibers considerably enhanced (7-fold) from 6.7 ± 2.1 MPa to 44.37 ± 3.5. The elongation at break has slightly increased from 6.66% to 7.3%. These results were in contrast to previous studies about chemical cross-linking treatment (Qin et al., 2020). These findings indicated that the introduction of the cross-linking network can effectively improve the mechanical performance of CP nanofibers due to covalent bonding among polymer chains in the cross-linking process. Figs. 8 and 9 illustrate mechanical characteristics of crosslinking nanocomposites fibers. Incorporation of GNPs into the polymer blend has significantly increased tensile strength from 11 MPa for pure polymer blend to 46 MPa for 1.0 wt% GNPs content and elongation at break from 7.3% to 21%. Higher GNPs content resulted in a slight decrease in tensile strength relative to 1.0 wt%. The maximum elongation at break was for nanocomposite of 0.5 wt%. Increasing GNPs content above 1.0 wt% resulted in reduced mechanical properties due to increased clustering. Increased tensile strength for all GNPs contents relative to pure polymer blend was due to the physical interaction between GNPs and polymer chains which improves the ability to respond against applied tensional force. For all GNPs contents, elongation at break was higher than pure polymer blend and the highest was for 0.5 wt%. The reason for this phenomenon is the formation of a physical 3D network of GNPs and adsorptive interaction between nanosheets and polymer chains acting as a solid elastic material transferring applied force through the sample and the ability of the chains to stretch in the constructed 3D network. Fig. 13 Shows Young's module and toughness of CP cross-linked nanofibers with different GNPs content. The toughness of CP cross-linked nanofibers was 44.37 ± 6.3 MPa. However, the toughness considerably increased (290 ± 2.3 and 365 ± 7.6 MPa respectively) by incorporating 1 and 2 GNPs. The Young's modulus of the CP cross-linked nanofibers was 2.85 ± 0.211 MPa by adding GNPs, the Young's modulus was 4.2 ± 053 MPa for 0.5 GNPs and 4.8 ± 0.32 MPa for 1GNPs. However, Young's modulus of nanofibers noticeably decreased when the content of GNPs increased more than 2 wt%. Eventually, these results with excellent structure and electrical conductivity suggest that the GNPs-CP electrospun nanofibers, particularly 1GNPs-CP electrospun nanofibers, may provide a good potential application as hard and soft tissue scaffolds, implants and skin."
13,Conclusion,"The present research aimed to develop hybrid nanocomposites fibers based on chitosan-PVA matrix modified with GNPs fillers to simultaneously improve electrical and mechanical properties. Electrospinning technique was implemented to produced hybrid electrospun nanofibers composed of chitosan, PVA with different GNPs contents (0, 0.5,1,2 and 5 wt%). The key findings show that the morphological and topology of nanocomposites fibers are improved. All samples have a uniform morphology with no bead. The addition of 1 wt% GNPs results in a significant reduction in the diameter of nanofibers from 370 ± 40 nm (CP) to 144 ± 18 nm (1GNPs-CP) due to increasing the conductivity of CP suspension after GNPs incorporation. GNPs in the range of 94 ± 12 nm size are uniformly dispersed within CP matrix. Furthermore, nanofibers are crosslinked by glutaraldehyde/water/propanol media under the acidic condition which preserves the fibrous structure and porosity of nanofibers. However, the average diameter of crosslinking nanofibers is enhanced due to the swelling of nanofibers during the cross-linking process. The resulting electrospun nanofibers demonstrate that hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction occur between nanocomposites fibers components which provide homogenous dispersion of GNPs in CP matrix and promote the reinforcement effect of GNPs in nanocomposites fibers which reflected as the improvement of mechanical properties. Moreover, Chitosan/PVA electrospun nanofibers show an amorphous morphology. However, increasing the amount of GNPs has a slight impact on the crystalline behavior of CP nanofibers since GNPs act as nucleating agents to develop the crystallinity of the composites. Results of BET analysis and BJH pore size distribution illustrate that specific surface area and pore volume of 1GNPs-CP are increased compared to CP electrospun nanofibers by incorporation of GNPs. It leads to a reduction in the diameter of nanofibers and pore size (5.3 nm), as well. According to these results, application of 1GNPs-CP is proposed in cell function performances for facilitating the growth, proliferating and migrating of cells. The electrical conductivity test shows that Chitosan/PVA/GNPs nanocomposites fibers represent superior electrical conductivity with a percolation threshold of 0.5 wt%. High electrical conductivity of 0.01 S/m for 1GNPs-CP is achieved. These outcomes are ascribed to a higher aspect ratio leading to providing abundant tunneling site for electron transport and uniform dispersion of GNP which improve a 3D network of conductive fillers. The electrical conductivity of cross-linked nanofibers is almost equal to the ones for not cross-linked nanofibers. Also, addition of GNPs into the CP matrix considerably enhances the tensile strength without deteriorating ductility. The tensile strength of the CP electrospun nanofibers is 3.34 ± 0.5 MPa and 7.3 ± 2.4 and 11 ± 1.1 MPa for the 0.5 GNPs-CP and 1GNPs-CP nanofibers respectively and also 130% improvement of ductility of 1GNPs-CP is achieved compared to CP electrospun nanofibers. Compared to CP nanofibers, the toughness of 1GNPs-CP and 2GNPs-CP nanofibers substantially increase (12 and 21-fold, respectively). Furthermore, the incorporation of 0.5 wt% and 1 wt% GNPs prominently improve Young's Modulus from 0.282 ± 0.018 to 2.09 ± 0.16 MPa for 0.5GNPs-CP and also a 10-fold improvement for 1GNPs-CP in comparison to CP nanofibers. It could be due to the intrinsic properties of GNPs, the homogeneity of nanocomposites and the interfacial interaction between GNPs and polymer matrix leading to appropriate load transfer between GNPs and matrix. However, the formation of micron-sized agglomerates in 2GNPs-CP and 5GNPs-CP nanocomposite fibers and the poor distribution of high GNPs in the CP matrix leads to a reduction in the mechanical properties. All mechanical properties of cross-linked GNPs-CP nanocomposite fibers are higher than GNPs-CP nanocomposite fibers due to the covalent bonding among polymer chains in the cross-linking process. Eventually, the resulting nanocomposite fibers were improved as tissue engineering scaffolds concerning good biocompatibility of CP matrix with improvement of the physical, mechanical and electrical characteristics of polymer matrix by GNPs nanofillers. this causes GNPs-CP nanofibers has been potential candidate for tissue engineering scaffolds. Particularly, 1GNPs-CP nanofibers are the best candidate for nerve tissue scaffolds based on its magnificent properties."
