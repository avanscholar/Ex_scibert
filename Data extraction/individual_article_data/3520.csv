0,Introduction,"Biohydrogen production using organic wastewater and biomass promises to be an economical and sustainable technology for energy source generation [1]. Biotechnology of hydrogen production has gained broad attention around the world [2,3]. Hydrogen production by microorganisms can be divided into two main categories: hydrogen production by photosynthetic organisms in the light and hydrogen production via fermentation metabolism of anaerobic bacteria. The efficiency of hydrogen production by photosynthetic microorganism is low, and it cannot be continuously operated in the absence of light [4]. Compared with photosynthetic hydrogen production processes, fermentation hydrogen production is more widely used because it has the advantages of no light requirements, high hydrogen production stability, control simplicity, low operating costs, high feasibility of industrialization [5]. Although biohydrogen production at the pilot-scale has been conducted by mixed fermentative bacteria [6], the optimal condition for hydrogen production is not yet fully understood. Therefore, some primary problems still need to be resolved for industrializing hydrogen production. An efficient start-up of the reactor is quite important for hydrogen production at full-scale. Currently, in order to realize quick start-up of hydrogen-producing reactors, some researchers use heat treatment of the inoculum and low pH to limit methanogenesis [1]. Since more and more studies indicated that a lot of hydrogen-producing bacteria are non-sporeforming [7], heat treatment of the inoculum is not suitable for hydrogen production industrialization. However, the enrichment and acclimation of hydrogen-producing bacteria is slowly in reactors. Bioaugmentation by putting highly effective hydrogen-producing bacteria is a potential approach for hydrogen production industrialization. Keeping high cell density and metabolic activity of hydrogen-producing bacteria in the bioaugmentation is an important step towards increasing hydrogen production in a continuous-flow bioreactor [8]. Specially, higher H 2 production rate and higher cell density of hydrogen-producing bacteria is required in a microbial community for practical industrial application. To achieve this end, the practice of immobilizing cells using support carriers has been adopted [9]. This limits the hydrogen-producing efficiency and increases the cost more. Rachman et al. reported a self-flocculating Enterobacter aerogens AY-2 for continuous hydrogen-production, and developed a new approach by utilizing self-immobilized cells without carriers [10]. Subsequently, Yokoi et al. researched continuous-flow operation for hydrogen production using Enterobacter sp. BY-29 which can produce flocculants [11]. Although self-flocculating bacteria form flocs by producing flocculants, bacterial cells run out in some degree in effluent. The presence of non-flocculating bacteria is often considered a nuisance, responsible for an increase in cells escaping from the reactor. All reported hydrogen-producing bacteria are non-aggregating bacteria. Efficient aggregation and settling of flocs are important for holding biomass in bioreactor [8]. Populations have the relationship of cooperation and competition in a certain niche. Dominant populations in microbial communities are determined by ecological factors. However, the culture conditions that can affect microbial community structure and hydrogen production are only beginning to be studied and are therefore not well-understood. Some studies indicated that pH and substrate concentrations affect hydrogen production [12]. In addition, some isolates that were put in reactors cannot become dominant due to their inability to grow in communities. If bacteria introduced to a community do not acclimate quickly, they will not dominate the population. High biomass and strong growth ability are necessary for applying of hydrogen-producing bacteria in industrialization. This paper describes the effect of culture conditions on hydrogen production and growth of auto-aggregative Ethanoligenens harbinense YUAN-3. In continuous-flow operation, the viability of strain YUNA-3 under non-sterile conditions was investigated. In addition, biomass and dominant position of strain YUAN-3 were monitored by molecular biological techniques."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Strain and batch tests,"2.1 Strain and batch tests An auto-aggregative E. harbinense YUAN-3 was used in this study, which was isolated from hydrogen-producing sludge, and deposited in our laboratory [7]. Strain YUAN-3 was cultured by an anaerobic Hungate technique. The single colony was picked from agar media, and inoculated to liquid media. When cells were in the logarithmic growth phase, and then were inoculated into 50mL serum bottle. Hydrogen production tests were performed on batch reactors under anaerobic condition, for 130rpm shaking cultivation. The minimum medium included glucose 10g/L, peptone 2g/L, K 2 HPO 4 1.5g/L, MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O 0.1g/L and FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O 0.1g/L."
3,Continuous-flow tests,"2.2 Continuous-flow tests The biohydrogen production reactor was a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) (Fig. 1 ). Seal the reactor in order to have anaerobic conditions. The effective volume of the reactor was 0.5L and the temperature was kept constant at 35 ± 1 ∘ C by using an auto-temperature controller. The magnetic stirrer mixed influent substrate with bacteria at 75rpm. pH value in the reactor was kept above 3.5 by a pH controller. Fifty mL seed culture before the end of logarithmic growth phase was transferred into a CSTR. Continuous operation was initiated by feeding non-sterile medium with dilution rate of 0.1 h - 1 . The 1g/L glucose was used as substrate, and influent pH was controlled around 5.0. No other nutrient salt was added except 0.2% peptone. When strain biomass began to increase and the glucose was consumed quickly, the dilution rate was increased stepwise at 4-day intervals. During whole operation, the dilution rate was from 0.1 to 0.6 (it equated hydraulic retention time was from 10 to 1.7h), the effluent pH was monitored, and when it dropped below 3.5, the influent pH was increased."
4,Chemical analysis,"2.3 Chemical analysis Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were determined by gas chromatography (GC-122, Shanghai Analytical Apparatus Corporation, China) which is equipped with FID and a 2.0m steel column filled with GDX-103 (60/80 mesh). Operational temperatures for the injection port, the oven and the detector were 190, 220 and 220°C, respectively. Nitrogen, hydrogen and air were used as the carrier gases at a flow rate of 60, 50 and 490mL/min, respectively. Hydrogen was determined with a gas chromatograph (SC-2, Shanghai Analytical Apparatus Corporation, China) which is equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2.0m steel column filled with Porapak Q (50/80 mesh). Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 40mL/min [4]."
5,DNA extraction,"2.4 DNA extraction Genomic DNA was extracted and purified using the Bacteria DNA Mini Kit (Watson Biotechnologies Inc., Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions."
6,Real-time PCR,"2.5 Real-time PCR Real-time PCR amplification was performed in a Chromo4 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). A pair of genus-specific primer Etha202/Etha604 targeted 16S rRNA gene for Ethanoligenens sp. was designed by Xing et al. [13]. The reaction mixture ( 10 μ L ) consisted of 10mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.3), 50mM KCl, 1.5mM MgCl 2 , 200 μ M (each) deoxynucleoside triphosphates, a 1:100,000 dilution of SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), 0.5U of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Dalian, China), 0.25 μ M (each) specific primers, and 1 μ L of × 1 , × 10 and × 100 diluted template DNA. The reaction conditions was composed of initial denaturation at 94°C for 5min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30s, annealing at 62°C for 45s, and extension at 72°C for 1min, and a final 7min elongation at 72°C. The melting curves were obtained by slow heating at 0.2°C/s increments from 60 to 99°C. The PCR products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. For determination of the number of Ethanoligenens sp. presented in each sample, fluorescent signals detected from three serial dilutions in the linear range of the assay were averaged and compared to a standard curve generated with standard DNA in the same experiment. Strain YUAN-3 was used as the standard strain."
7,Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis,"2.6 Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE was performed as described by Xing et al. [4]. The variable V3 region of 16S rDNA was amplified by PCR with primers to conserved regions of the 16S rRNA genes. The nucleotide sequences of the primers were as follows: primer BSF338, 5 ′ -ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3 ′ ; primer BSR534, 5 ′ -ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3 ′ ; primer 338FGC, 5 ′ -CGCCCGCCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGTCCCGCCGCCCCCGCCCGACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3 ′ . The samples were amplified in a Perkin–Elmer Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) GenAmp PCR System 9700 programmed as follows: initial denaturation of DNA for 5min at 94°C; 30 cycles of 1min at 94°C, 30s at 60°C, and 30s at 72°C; decreasing 0.1°C per cycle to 57°C, and extension of incomplete products for 8min at 72°C. DGGE was performed with a DCode TM universal mutation detection system (Bio-Rad, USA). The PCR samples were applied directly to 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in a 1 × TAE buffer with a denaturing gradient ranging from 30% to 60%. Denaturation of 100% corresponds to 7M urea and 40% (v/v) formamide. The gradient gel was cast with a gradient delivery system (Model 475, Bio-Rad, USA). Electrophoresis was run at a constant voltage of 200V and at 60°C. After 3.5h of electrophoresis, the gel was stained with AgNO 3 [14]. Prominent DGGE bands were selected and used for excision. The reamplified products were purified by Gel Recovery Purification Kit (Watson Biotechnologies Inc., Shanghai, China) and cloned by the pMD18-T plasmid vector system (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cloned PCR fragments were sequenced by an ABI-Prism model 3730 automatic sequencer (Perkin–Elmer, Forest City, CA, USA)."
8,Phylogenetic analysis,"2.7 Phylogenetic analysis All 16S rDNA sequences from this study were compared with those of the reference bacterium available in the GenBank database by BLAST search [15]. These sequences were aligned with the closest matches found in the GenBank with the ClustalW function of the BioEdit package [16]. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were constructed with the Jukes–Cantor algorithm [17,18], and the robustness of the phylogeny was tested by bootstrap analysis with 1000 iterations."
9,Results and discussions,
10,Effect of culture conditions on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of culture conditions on hydrogen production In order to optimize operational conditions for continuous hydrogen production of strain YUAN-3, effects of temperature, pH and initial concentration of glucose on hydrogen production were investigated in batch test. After 24h of fermentation, biomass, pH and hydrogen productivity were determined. Results indicated that H 2 yield and H 2 production rate of strain YUAN-3 were significantly different under different temperature conditions. The bacterial biomass, H 2 yield and H 2 production rate increased first and then decreased as the temperature increased (Fig. 2 A). The biomass and H 2 production rate were highest at 35°C, and average values were 0.83g/L and 4.57mmol/g-dry cell/h, respectively, but the highest H 2 yield of 1.34mol/mol-glucose was achieved at 37°C. In previous research, we found strain YUAN-3 grew at 20–44°C, with optimum growth at 35°C [7]. Therefore, strain YUAN-3 has the highest biomass and H 2 production rate at same temperatures, while not the highest H 2 yield. pH value had a noticeable effect on the cell growth and hydrogen production. pH range for growth of strain YUAN-3 was 3.5–9.0, optimum growth was at pH 4.5–5.0 [7]. Maximum H 2 production rate, H 2 yield and biomass were observed around pH 5.0, average values were 4.55mmol/g-dry cell/h, 1.91mol/mol-glucose and 0.81g/L, respectively (Fig. 2B). Below and above this pH, hydrogen production and biomass decreased gradually. pH values of optimum growth and hydrogen production for strain YUAN-3 were the same. Differences in biomass of YUAN-3 were observed at different initial concentrations of glucose, as seen in Fig. 2C. The biomass increased first and then decreased with increasing glucose concentration (from 5 to 8g/L). The H 2 yield and H 2 production rate of strain YUAN-3 increased correspondingly. When the initial concentration of glucose was 10g/L, strain YUAN-3 achieved the highest biomass of 0.80g/L. When the initial concentration of glucose was increased gradually (from 12 to 20g/L), H 2 yield and H 2 production rate decreased. When the initial concentration of glucose was 10g/L, strain YUAN-3 achieved the highest H 2 yield and H 2 production rate, 1.84mol/mol-glucose and 4.26mmol/g-dry cell/h (Fig. 2C). The above results show that substrate concentration had an influence on hydrogen production, and led to the changes in the cell growth and metabolic activity of strain YUAN-3. When glucose was lacking, nutritional media were mainly used for the anabolism and rapid growth of cells, and the bacteria could not release energy well. When glucose was sufficient, hydrogen production decreased due to liquid fermentative products being inhibited by an over-accumulation of VFAs and alcohol. Overall, an optimum condition for hydrogen production was 35°C, pH 5.0 and 10g/L glucose in batch test."
11,Continuous hydrogen production,"3.2 Continuous hydrogen production The time courses of continuous hydrogen production under non-sterile conditions in the CSTR are shown in Fig. 3 . After strain YUAN-3 was inoculated into a reactor, it formed immediately into flocs by auto- and co-aggregation and settled in the bottom of reactor, the dilution rate was increased stepwise to 0.6 h - 1 . The H 2 yield and production rate both increased quickly after start-up (Fig. 3A). After operating for 4 days, H 2 yield increased linearly, reaching the highest yield of 1.92mol/mol-glucose at a dilution rate of 0.4 h - 1 , and then decreased while dilution rate reached 0.5 h - 1 . H 2 production rate also increased quickly, and within 15 days had reached its highest value of 32.2mmol H 2 /L-medium/h at a dilution rate of 0.5 h - 1 , and then H 2 production rate decreased. In the fermentative gas, hydrogen content was also maintained at 45–50% (data not shown). When dilution rate reached 0.6 h - 1 , H 2 yield and H 2 production rate began to drop slowly. All glucose substrate was consumed during the whole operation (data not shown). The change of liquid fermentation products and effluent pH during the start-up period is shown in Fig. 3B. Liquid products were as follows: ethanol, acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate and lactate. Along with the increase of the dilution rate, the concentrations of ethanol and acetate increased gradually and ethanol-type fermentation products formed one day later. Ethanol and acetate accounted for more than 85% by mole of liquid products. Effluent pH dropped quickly to 3.71 on the third day, rose gradually by day 5, and then dropped again with increasing dilution rate. Strain cells continued to accumulate in the bottom of the reactor during continuous operation. Real-time PCR indicated that cell number increased with increasing dilution rate, and reached a maximum of 10 9 cfu / mL on day 16 at a dilution rate of 0.5 h - 1 (Fig. 3C). Although cell numbers in the effluent increased with increasing dilution rate, the amount of aggregative flocs in the CSTR also remained high. The overflow rate of cells was less than 0.1% in the continuous-flow reactor. These results suggest that the aggregative strain YUAN-3 could be retained with high dilution in a CSTR, and produce large amount of hydrogen."
12,Bacterial community diversity,"3.3 Bacterial community diversity Strain YUAN-3 was inoculated into a CSTR and continuously operated under non-sterile conditions. In order to detect whether this strain was dominant, bacterial diversity was monitored by DGGE. DGGE profiles of 16S rRNA showed the dynamics and diversity of bacterial community in a CSTR. Fig. 4 showed that some bacterial invaders appeared on day 7; band profiles from 14th to the 21st day were identical. Ten predominant DGGE bands were excised and used for reamplification and sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. Sequences analyses indicated that each band included a unique 16S rRNA sequence. Overall 10 sequences were recovered from DGGE bands. Compared with the database of 16S rRNA genes derived from cultivated strains, 2 (bands 4 and 6) of the 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) had a sequence similarity < 97% with type or non-type strains. A phylogenetic tree was constructed by evolutionary distance matrix method, as shown in Fig. 5 . It demonstrated that the dominant populations could be divided into two groups. The dominant populations belonged to Firmicutes (low G + C gram-positive bacteria) and Bacteroides. The results of 16S rRNA sequences indicated that hydrogen-producing bacteria were affiliated with Megasphaera sueciensis, Megasphaera hominis and E. harbinense. Although a DGGE profile cannot give the absolute amount of bacteria, it can present a relative quantitative relationship between different bands. Band 10, which represented strain YUAN-3, was obviously the dominant population when the reactor had been running 7 days. When the reactor had been running for 21 days, most of dominant populations were hydrogen-producing bacteria. Because the liquid products of glucose fermentation of Megasphaera sp. are acetate, propionate and butyrate, and not ethanol [19], Ethanoligenens sp. was determined to be the dominant hydrogen-producing bacterium, based on the liquid products. Strain YUAN-3 was the large majority of the dominant population. Because of this, there was a large amount of hydrogen and ethanol in the fermentation products. Strain YUAN-3 became dominant through enrichment, and it showed a successful continuous operation. We first isolated an auto-aggregative hydrogen-producing bacterium. Strain YUAN-3 forms large auto-aggregative granules (0.5–5mm, sometimes granule up to 1.5cm) in shake culture; while the culture media is clear [7]. However, auto-aggregative bacteria with hydrophobic properties can form bigger granules than self-flocculated bacteria, and can settle preferentially. The above results demonstrated that strain YUAN-3 has strong viability and competition ability in a microbial community under non-sterile conditions. These results imply that this strain is a promising candidate for optimizing a hydrogen-producing community by bioaugmentation. Moreover, this strain has high hydrogen production rate and stronger pH tolerance. Inhibiting methanogenesis by lower pH (although it is below 5) cannot affect hydrogen production of strain YUAN-3. Overall, this strain has a wide application potential in industrialization of biohydrogen production."
13,Conclusions,"Optimum conditions for hydrogen production was 35°C, pH 5.0 and 10g/L glucose in batch. H 2 yield reached the highest value at 1.92mol/mol-glucose at a dilution rate of 0.4 h - 1 . H 2 production rate also increased quickly, reaching the highest value at 32.2mmol H 2 /L-medium/h at a dilution rate of 0.5 h - 1 , and then decreasing with increased dilution rate. Aggregative strain YUAN-3 could be retained with high dilution in a CSTR, and produced large amounts of hydrogen in continuous-flow operation. Some bacterial invaders appeared on day 7, and became part of the dominant population gradually. The results of 16S rRNA sequences indicated that there were at least three types of hydrogen-producing bacteria in the dominant populations after operating 7 days. They were affiliated with M. sueciensis, M. hominis and E. harbinense. The majority of dominant populations belonged to E. harbinense with enrichment during the running of the reactor, indicating that a successful continuous operation was achieved."
