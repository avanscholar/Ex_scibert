0,Introduction,"Even though research on biological H2 production has been carried out over a quarter century [1], hydrogen is produced almost entirely from fossil fuels such as natural gas and naphtha. In such processes, the same amount of CO2 as that formed from combustion is released [2]. Besides being an environmentally friendly fuel, producing only water upon combustion, H2 has an energy yield of 142 kJ/g, 2.75 times higher than that of any hydrocarbon [3]. In the direct bioconversion of cellulose to hydrogen, the precise role that temperature has on the stability of hydrogen production from cellulose remains unclear at this stage. Two temperatures that have been commonly used in the literature: the mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. It has been reported that mesophilic anaerobic bacteria are not capable of utilizing cellulose effectively. While, in order to hydrolyze the cellulose so that it can generate H2 by mesophilic anaerobic bacteria, exogenous cellulose enzymes need to be added to the culture [4]. Since thermophilic anaerobic bacteria can effectively utilize cellulose, they have great potential for H2 production using cellulose without the addition of exogenous cellulose [5]. In just the last few years, a group of bacteria have been discovered that have the remarkable property of growing near and above 100 °C [6]. Under hyper-thermophilic anaerobic conditions, yields of hydrogen close to the theoretical stoichiometry were obtained using glucose as the carbon source [7]. These yields are superior to those found in other studies using fermentative microorganisms [8]. Yet the description of bio-hydrogen production of cellulose using continuous mode under hyper-thermophilic condition 80 °C has not been reported. Another important consideration for the production of hydrogen from anaerobic fermentation is that most of studies focused on batch mode for Bio-H2 production from cellulose [4,5,9–11]. To date, many studies have been done on fermentative hydrogen production from pure sugars and from feedstocks, such as by-products from the agricultural and food industry, municipal waste, or wastewaters [12–15]. However, few studies have been dedicated to describe the continuous hydrogen production using cellulose. Because cellulose is particularly difficult to hydrolyze, its uses have been considered extremely limited [16]. In nature, cellulosic materials are degraded by the cooperation of many microorganisms. It has been reported that mixed cultures comprised of cellulolytic and non-cellulolytic bacteria are ideal for the degradation of cellulose [17,18]. This bacterial community is capable of degrading natural cellulosic materials aerobically and anaerobically without sterilization and with a high degree of stability. Microorganisms that degrade cellulosic materials and the enzymes involved (e.g. cellulase, xylanase and peroxidase) have been well studied [19,20]. Some anaerobic bacteria have been shown to be capable of degrading cellulose, with ethanol, hydrogen and organic acids as the main products [21]. The fact remains, however, that cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer on earth. It is one of the three major polymers found in lignocellulose, which makes up plant cells (along with hemicellulose, and lignin) [22,23], and is the chief component of plant biomass. Cellulose fibers have a partial crystalline structure which is integrated with hemicellulose and embedded in a lignin matrix [24]. Cellulolytic material is the largest source of hexose and pentose sugars, and has enormous potential for use in the production of fuel, alcohol, chemicals and protein for both food and feed purposes [25–27]. The overall objectives of this study were to confirm the possibility of continuous H2 production from cellulose by continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) using anaerobic mixed microflora without pre-treatment, and to clarify the effects of fermentation temperatures and cellulose degradation efficiency."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inocula and medium,"2.1 Inocula and medium The anaerobic mixed microflora was obtained from a sewage sludge digester at the Sendai municipal sewage treatment plant in Japan without pretreatment. The medium for dark H2 fermentation was constituted of the following (g/l): Cellulose 5, NH4HCO3 2, NaHCO3 3, K2HPO4 0.125, MgCl2·6H2O 0.1, MnSO4·6H2O 0.015, FeSO4·7H2O 0.025, CuSO4·5H2O 0.005 and CoCl2·5H2O 1.25 × 10−4."
3,Experimental setup and operation,"2.2 Experimental setup and operation The experimental apparatus was composed of two parts, including (i) feedstock tank and (ii) H2 producing acidogenic reactor. A substrate maintained at 4 °C in feedstock tank was fed into CSTR by a peristaltic pump with a time-control system Fig. 1 . Three continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTR) were operated under different temperature, 37 ± 2 °C [Mesophilic], 55 ± 2 °C [Thermophilic] and 80 ± 2 °C [Hyper-thermophilic] with an effective volume of 6 L and operated using a hydraulic retention time [HRT] of 10 days."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The percentage of H2 in the biogas was determined by a gas chromatograph [Shimadzu 8A] equipped with a thermal conductivity. Detector [TCD] and a stainless steel column packed with a molecular sieve 5A [60/80 3 mmØ]. The temperatures of the detector and the column were maintained at 100 °C and 60 °C, respectively. For the determination of the carbon dioxide, nitrogen and methane content, the same model of gas chromatograph [Shimadzu 8A] was used, and it was equipped with a TCD and a stainless steel column packed with Porapak T was used. The temperatures of the detector and the column, here, were maintained at 100 °C and 70 °C, respectively. The organic acids were analyzed by a gas chromatograph [Shimadzu GC-1700] equipped with a flame ionization detector [FID] and a 30 m column [J&W DB-WAX]. The volatile suspended solid [VSS], volatile solid [VS], protein and chemical oxygen demand [COD] were measured according to the procedures described in the Standard Methods [28]."
5,Theoretical estimates of the net energy gain,"2.4 Theoretical estimates of the net energy gain The theoretical net energy gain, E N (kJ/g COD in feedstock) in this study is defined as the total energy produced equivalent to the hydrogen volume generated by E DF (kJ), minus any heat energy required, E H (kJ) to raise the influent volume from ambient temperature (T a) to the fermentation temperature (T f). The following equations form the basis of our analysis in continuous mode: (1) E DF = Y H 2 C Q ρ H 2 ( LHV ) (2) E H = Q ρ w c ρ ( T f − T a ) where, Y H 2 is the hydrogen production yield (l/gCOD); C is the COD concentration of the feedstock (g COD/l); Q is flow rate of the influent (l/day); ρ H 2 is the density of gaseous hydrogen (8.9 × 10−5 kg/l); ρ w is the density of water (1 kg/l); LHV is the lower heating value of hydrogen [120,000 kJ/kg]; and c ρ is the specific heat of water (4.2 kJ/kg K). Assuming negligible heat loss from the reactor into atmosphere, (3) E N = E DF − E H Q C"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Operational performance and the steady state condition,"3.1 Operational performance and the steady state condition The time course of the biogas production rates (a), gas concentrations (b), pH (c), total volatile fatty acid (VFA) mg/l (d) and VSS g/l (e) in the mesophilic reactor are presented in Fig. 2 . As can be seen from a comparison between parameters, this system reached to steady state at the 40th day of operation. The biogas production ranged between 0.35 and 0.4 l/l/day with gas composition of 2% H2 and 26% CH4 Fig. 2(a) and (b). These results suggested that, untreated seed sludge was responsible for generating methane gas in gas content under this condition. The results of this experiment completely agreed with cellulose fermentation by continuous mode cultures of Rumiococcus albus and Methanobrevibacter smithii, where the major products were acetate, methane and CO2 reported by Pavlostathis [29]. However, other study reported that no significant methane was detected in bio-H2 generation by mesophilic fermentation of cellulose using batch mode due to inhibit/deactivate hydrogentrophic bacteria [30]. The pH in the reactor was able to be maintained within an appropriate range of 5.7–5.9 throughout the experiment Fig. 2(d), due to using sodium bicarbonate, which is considered a strong buffering of growth medium. With respect to thermophilic reactor, the daily variation of biogas production rates (a) and gas concentrations (b), pH (c), total volatile fatty acid (VFA) mg/l (d) and VSS g/l (e) in the thermophilic reactor are presented in Fig. 3 . The steady state appeared at the 32nd day Fig. 3(a) with biogas production ranged between 0.4 and 0.47 l/l/day. The biogas composed of 51% H2 with no CH4 gas Fig. 3(b). The experimental results show that, the thermophilic temperature was able to destroy the methanogenic bacteria in the untreated seed sludge. Typically, a similar amount of H2 has been reported as the main gaseous product of cellulose by Clostridium thermocellum in the continuous culture [31] and in the batch culture [9]. The pH in the reactor was able to be maintained within an appropriate range of 5.6–5.8 throughout the experiment. As regards to the hyper-thermophilic reactor, Fig. 4 presents the daily variation of biogas production rates (a) and gas concentrations (b), pH (c), total volatile fatty acid (VFA) mg/l (d) and VSS g/l (e). The steady state observed at the 26th day with biogas production ranged between 0.43 and 0.52 l/l/day. The biogas composed of 55% of H2 and no CH4 was detected. These results ensured that, the thermophilic and hyper-thermophilic temperature were able to produce hydrogen gas as a by-product with no methane gas from cellulose without pretreatment for both seed sludge and cellulose throughout the experiment [31–35]. The pH in the reactor was able to be maintained within an appropriate range of 5.6–5.7. Our results are in good agreement, where the wheat straw was utilized without chemical pretreatment as sole energy and carbon sources for H2 production by the extreme thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus. The experimental results showed that, the maximum H2 production was 3.8 mol H2/mol glucose [36]."
8,Effect of temperature on stability of bio-hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of temperature on stability of bio-hydrogen production Operational temperature is commonly a critical factor to the performance of the process. In this study, the continuous H2 fermentation was carried using three different temperatures (37, 55 and 80 °C) in order to identify the best conditions for H2 production of cellulose. While a stable but low hydrogen production was obtained under the mesophilic temperature in this study, hydrogen production was higher and more stable under the thermophilic and hyper-thermophilic temperatures. Our results showed that the degradation efficiency of cellulose Figs. 2–4(e), and hydrogen yield were increased as the temperature increased from mesophilic through thermophilic to hyper-thermophilic temperatures. This demonstrated that at 55 and 80 °C, temperature can enhance the ability of mixed culture to degrade cellulose to hydrogen, which was also shown by other studies [31–33]. At 37 °C, on the other hand, hydrogen and methane gases were produced during the fermentation of cellulose."
9,Average performance of three reactors under steady state condition,"3.3 Average performance of three reactors under steady state condition A summary of the average performance of the reactors under steady state condition is provided in Table 1 . In the mesophilic reactor, 61% of the influent cellulose was degraded into 0.6 mmol H2 and 7 mmol CH4 per gram cellulose under stable pH 5.9. As regards to thermophilic reactor, 59% of the influent cellulose was degraded into 15.2 mmol H2 per gram cellulose under stable pH 5.8. It is close to 58% cellulose degradation using sludge compost under thermophilic condition reported by Ueno [37]. In the mesophilic and thermophilic reactors, the experimental results agreed with batch experiment reported by Liu [33]. In the hyper-thermophilic reactor, the highest cellulose degradation reached to 77% that converted into 19.02 mmol H2 per gram cellulose under stable pH 5.7. It is higher than Cellulose destruction ranged from 22% to 71% for 0.25–2.27 days solids retention time, respectively by continuous cultures of Ruminococcus albus strain 7 and Methanobrevibacter smithii strain PS using cellulose [Avicel] as substrate reported by Spyros [29]. These results suggested that the operational temperature is key to sustainable bio-H2 production from cellulose as the sole of carbon source."
10,Effect of temperature on mass balance in the process,"3.4 Effect of temperature on mass balance in the process The effect of the temperature on COD mass balance of bio-H2 production of cellulose is presented in Table 2 . The products of anaerobic cellulose degradation could be divided into a solid, soluble, and biogas. The COD mass balance was calculated according to the COD conversion coefficient of each product. Under mesophilic temperature, 1% of the influent COD converted to hydrogen gas, 19% converted to methane gas. According to metabolic pathway of glucose, hydrogen is produced via the metabolic pathway of acetate or butyrate fermentation. The results of VFA composition indicated that the acetate and butyrate are preferable in this process with 8.4 and 15.1% respectively. As regards to thermophilic temperature, 21% of the influent COD converted to hydrogen gas. The main byproducts in VFA composition were acetate and butyrate, which reached to 16.7 and 10.1% of the influent COD, respectively. As for the hyper-thermophilic temperature, 29% of the influent COD converted to hydrogen gas. The 18% acetate and 10.3% butyrate were the main components in VFA composition. The experimental results recommended that the untreated sludge was unsuitable for bio-H2 production of cellulose at mesophilic condition, because the hydrogen produced converted into methane gas by methanogenic archaea. On the other hand, the preferable temperature for bio-H2 production of cellulose is thermophilic or hyper-thermophilic conditions. Based on the experimental results, the theoretical values for degrading 1 kg of cellulose could produce 0.174 m3 of methane gas and 0.015 m3of hydrogen under mesophilic temperature, whereas under thermophilic and hyper-thermophilic temperatures could produce 0.367 and 0.460 m3 of hydrogen gas, respectively."
11,Stoichiometry of the hydrogen fermentation of cellulose,"3.5 Stoichiometry of the hydrogen fermentation of cellulose According to metabolic products of cellulose fermentation in this study, the stoichiometry equations of the hydrogen fermentation of cellulose were calculated as follows. (The mesophilic reactor) (4) (C6H10O5) n → 1.28nCH4 + 0.11nH2 + 0.44nCH3COOH + 0.35nC3H6COOH + 3.31nCO2 + others (The thermophilic reactor) (5) (C6H10O5) n → 2.73nH2 + 0.53nCH3COOH + 0.50nC3H6COOH + 2.6nCO2 + others (The hyper-thermophilic reactor) (6) (C6H10O5) n → 3.43nH2 + 0.63nCH3COOH + 0.49nC3H6COOH + 3.01nCO2 + others From the stoichiometry equations (4)–(6), it is clear that fermentative characteristics in each reactor including yields of hydrogen and intermediate products were clearly different under different fermentation temperature. Stoichiometrically 2 mol of hydrogen is generated concomitant with 1 mol of acetate or butyrate (Equations. (7) and (8)). (7) Glucose + 2H2O → 2 acetate + 2CO2 + 4H2 (8) Glucose → butyrate + 2CO2 + 2H2 Table 3 compares actual hydrogen yields (Y exp) with the estimated hydrogen yield (Y est). The results show that the ratio of experimentally obtained hydrogen to those estimated was 0.07, 1.33 and 1.35 under mesophilic, thermophilic and hyper-thermophilic temperatures, respectively. This indicates that most acetate and butyrate yields were produced during hydrogen production under the thermophilic and the hyper-thermophilic temperatures [39]. On the other hand, most acetate and butyrate yields were produced during methane and low hydrogen production under the mesophilic temperature [29]."
12,Comparison of hydrogen production with previous studies,"3.6 Comparison of hydrogen production with previous studies Table 4 compares the hydrogen yields with previous studies using different fermentation temperature, hydrogen producer microorganism sources, pH and culture conditions. As can be seen the majority of bio-hydrogen production of cellulose studies have been done on batch mode in the literature. Under the mesophilic temperature, our results are significantly lower than other previous reports which are using the same H2 producer. This might be due to inhibited methanogenic archaea in the seed sludge [36,40]. In this study the maximum hydrogen production yield (19.02 mmol H2/g cellulose) obtained under hyper-thermophilic temperature in comparison with other reports. This might be due to the different microbial communities caused by the differences of inocula and pH. This is the first study on direct bioconversion of cellulose continuously under hyper-thermophilic temperature using mixed culture without pretreatment for both cellulose and sludge."
13,Effect of temperature on the net energy gain,"3.7 Effect of temperature on the net energy gain The prediction of net energy gain under three different temperatures for different influent cellulose concentrations, which calculated based on the H2 yield obtain from this study, are presented in Fig. 5 . As can be seen, Even thought higher fermentation temperature, thermophilic and hyper-thermophilic, have been viewed as favorable for high yield and stability of hydrogen production, the net energy gain was significantly negative in comparison with mesophilic condition at low concentration of cellulose ≤20 g/l. Our results are in good agreement with those reported for thermophilic temperature (55 °C), the same net energy gain has been obtained (−20.7 kJ/g COD) using cellulose-containing wastewater [33] and −22.6 kJ/g COD using starch wastewater [41] calculated by Perera et al. [42]. By increasing the cellulose concentrations (≥40 g/l), the thermophilic fermentation is still expected having a better economic performance for bioH2 production, especially when going toward feedstock options requiring pretreatment."
14,Conclusions,"This paper investigated the effect of fermentation temperature on biological hydrogen production from cellulose using sewage sludge without pre-treatment for both sewage sludge and cellulose. The maximum hydrogen yield was 19.02 mmol H2/g cellulose under the hyper-thermophilic temperature, whereas; they were 0.6 and 15.2 mmol H2/g cellulose at 5 g/l cellulose in the mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures, respectively. No methane was detected at thermophilic and hyper-thermophilic temperatures. The results show that operational temperature is a key to sustainable bio-hydrogen production and that the thermophilic and hyper-thermophilic conditions produced better results than mesophilic condition. As well as, the thermophilic fermentation is still expected having a better economic performance for bioH2 production, especially when going toward feedstock concentrations and pretreatment."
