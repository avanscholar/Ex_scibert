0,Introduction,"There is a growing concern about environmental pollution and the significant reduction in the petroleum reserve due to over dependence on petroleum resources. Actually, vast majority of the petroleum based products are not environment friendly as the production, use and recycling of these materials often pose a threat to the environment [1]. In recent years, interests in composites and polymer blends have increased because these materials are considered to be capable of helping to maintain the integrity of the environment. Therefore, biodegradable and environment benign materials are being considered as potential candidates to substitute the conventional petroleum based materials [2]. However, most biodegradable polymer based composites often exhibit poor mechanical properties coupled with high susceptibility to water and moisture uptake [3]. Hence, there is usually the challenge of how to achieve environment friendly materials with sufficient mechanical strength and highly desirable structural integrity suitable for different applications. On this basis, several micro- and nanofillers have been widely investigated as possible reinforcement for polymer matrices [4,5]. The last two decades have experience a surge in the number of potential reinforcing fillers and among the notable nanofillers, graphene (GE) is of particular interest. Graphene has been observed to be capable of replacing the conventional nanofillers such as nanoclays, and carbon nanotubes. This is associated with its low cost, high aspect ratio, low density, and impeccable mechanical, thermal and electrical properties [6–9]. These properties make graphene suitable for vast range of applications by exploiting its salient properties to suit the desired application. Usually, the high thermal conductivity of graphene is often exploited to produce composite materials with good thermal conductivity [10]. In addition, graphene has a good place among the strongest materials ever tested and with respect to nanocomposite research, it is mostly used as reinforcing filler for different polymeric matrices [1,10]. However, studies have shown that graphene filler needs to be well dispersed in polymer matrices in order to improve the performance of the resulting nanocomposite [10,11]. Unfortunately, the high surface area of graphene often promotes undesirable agglomeration in composite matrices as a result of strong van der Waals forces among the graphene particles [12,13]. In addition, the hydrophobic nature of graphene often hampers its proper dispersion in polar solvents, as well as polymer matrices which tend to limit its practical applications [11]. Previously, the miscibility of graphene with polymers has been achieved through surface modification of graphene via different approaches. Previous studies have showed that functionalization either through covalent or non-covalent methods could effectively facilitate the dispersibility of graphene in polymer matrices [14–17]. However, it has been observed that modification of graphene often result into composite materials with reduced structural properties [11]. Therefore, the production of high performance graphene based composites remains a major challenge. Cellulose is one of the thriving biodegradable and renewable materials that are fast becoming a household name in different polymeric applications [11,18,19]. Mostly, cellulose is preferred in the nanoscale as reinforcing filler wherein it is often referred to as nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC). The incorporation of this material into polymers could present significant enhancement in mechanical and thermal properties, as well as modify their crystalline behaviour [20]. This could help to facilitate their wider expansion into markets where sustainability is of high interest. Interestingly, NFC has been reported to reveal hydrophobic interactions with carbon nanotubes, carbon black, or graphene through its hydrophobic crystalline faces ((200) planes) [21–23]. Particularly, TEMPO derived NFC has garnered much attention recently owing to its unique properties such as high stiffness and strength, high aspect ratio, high aqueous stability, and desirable environmental friendliness [24–26]. However, very little research has been carried out on the use of NFC as stabilizer for graphene dispersion in nanocomposite applications [11,23]. Interestingly, NFC has been observed to be capable of offering several advantages such as good mechanical stiffness and high modulus, and the possibility to disperse NFC assisted nanomaterials in water. In addition, there are many oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of NFC which could help to enhance its interaction with polar polymers. Therefore, NFC is considered an ideal dispersant of graphene, without significantly disrupting the physical structure of the graphene particles. Furtherance to the growing interest in alternative biodegradable and sustainable materials, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) has been selected as the polymer matrix in this study. It is well known that PVA is non-toxic, possesses high chemical resistance properties, and it exhibits high water solubility. Being a synthetic polymer, PVA can present good compatibility with the nanofillers of interest herein such as NFC and graphene, and it can be formed into films suitable for various applications [27–29]. However, the suitability of PVA for most of its potential applications is dependent on humidity which could sometimes limit its use in many applications. Hence, it is pertinent to improve the water resistance performance of PVA nanocomposites in order to make it suitable for wider range of applications. On the other hand, whereas there are several studies, on reduced graphene, graphene oxide or reduce graphite for nanocompsite application, there are no many studies on the use of commercial graphene powder. In this study, NFC was used to stabilize aqueous dispersion of commercial graphene powder to produce PVA/GE nanocomposite with excellent thermal, mechanical and water resistance performance."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The graphene (GE) used in this study is GE (0544DX) nanopowder (11–15 nm) supplied by Skyspring Nanomaterials Inc. Poly(vinyl alcohol), powder Mw 89,000–98,000, 99+% hydrolysed was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Similarly, 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) with 11–14% available chlorine was supplied by Alfa Aeser while sodium bromide (NaBr) was supplied by Acros Organics."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Preparation of nanofibrillated cellulose Nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) was prepared via TEMPO-mediated oxidation, using pulp (obtained from white paper) as the original material following the method previously described in literature [25]. Briefly, the dried pulp was predispersed in distilled water and homogenized for 30 min using a laboratory mixer. About 15 g (dry weight) of the suspension was then dispersed in 1.5 L of distilled water which contains 0.24 g of TEMPO and 2.4 g of NaBr. The TEMPO-mediated oxidation was activated by adding 12 wt% NaClO solution (10 mmol/g of fiber) in drops to the pulp suspension under stirring at room temperature. The pH of the reaction was maintained within the range of 10–10.5 by adding 0.5 M NaOH in successions until the colour of the system changes to milky white, and without a further decrease in pH. After the reaction, the TEMPO-oxidized cellulose was washed thoroughly with deionized water and filtered. After this, a high shear homogenizer was used to disintegrate the treated fiber with subsequent sonication for 35 min to obtain the NFC. 2.2.2 Preparation of NFC-GE hybrids Different wt% content of GE nanopowder (1, 3 and 5 wt%) was added into a well-dispersed NFC solution (3 g of NFC) under magnetic stirring. The mixture was kept under stirring for 1 h after which it was sonicated for 30 min to obtain the NFC-GE suspension. 2.2.3 Preparation of PVA-NFC-GE nanocomposite films The PVA solution (15 wt%) was prepared by stirring the PVA powder in heated distilled water (85 °C for 4 h) until it was totally dissolved. The prepared NFC-GE suspension was introduced into calculated volumes of the PVA solution (10 wt% PVA) to obtain nanocomposites with different wt% GE content. Code names were given to the different prepared samples based on their composition as summarized in Table 1 . After continued stirring for 1 h, the mixture was subsequently sonicated for 30 min after which the homogenous PVA-NFC-GE suspension was cast into a glass mould and allowed to dry at room temperature for 48 h. After this, the nanocomposite films were stored in a desiccator until required for further analysis. 2.2.4 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy The FTIR spectra of the materials were obtained from a Shimadzu FTIR spectrophotometer (Model-IR affinity-1S). The IR spectra were recorded over a wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1 after 32 scans, using the standard KBr technique. 2.2.5 Tensile test The tensile test was performed using an Instron universal testing machine (Series IX version 8.25.00). Dumbbell samples with dimension 25 mm × 4 mm were prepared according to the procedure described in ASTM D638-95. Testing was conducted at a crosshead speed of 5 mm min−1 on dry samples at 23 °C. Results of five replicate samples were recorded for the tensile strength (TS) and tensile modulus (TM). 2.2.6 Thermogravimetric analysis Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal gravimetry (DTG) analysis were performed using a TA analyzer (TGA Q500 V6.4, Germany). Dried samples were placed in a platinum crucible and analysis was performed under nitrogen atmosphere flowing at 40 mL min−1 at a constant rate of 10 °C min−1 from 25 to 650 °C. 2.2.7 Differential scanning calorimetric analysis Calorimetry analysis (DSC) was performed in a TA instrument (DSC Q1000). Samples were heated from 25 to 250 °C at a constant rate of 10 °C min−1. The melting temperature (T m ) was determined from the DSC thermogram and the crystallinity (XDSC) of PVA in the nanocomposites was calculated by heat of fusion of the tested sample and a reference sample with 100% crystallinity, using equation (1). (1) % c r y s t a l l i n i t y ( X D S C ) = Δ H Δ H m W x 100 % where, ΔH and ΔH m are the heat of fusion of sample and heat of fusion of reference PVA with 100% crystallinity respectively, while W is the mass fraction of the matrix [30]. The heat of fusion of reference PVA with 100% crystallinity was taken as 161 J/g [31]. 2.2.8 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis The XRD analysis was performed at 1deg min−1, sampling step of 0.020, over 2ϴ range of 3-500 at a wavelength of 0.541 nm using an XRD diffractometer. 2.2.9 Dynamic mechanical analysis Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was conducted using Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA Q800) instrument. The DMA analysis was performed in a tension mode (amplitude: 20 μm), under 1 Hz frequency from −40 °C to 100 °C at a rate of 3 °C min−1 on 10.5 mm × 5 mm specimens. 2.2.10 Wettability and water absorption analysis The hydrophilic properties of PVA and the nanocomposites were investigated though wettability studies by measuring the contact angle of water on the films. The contact angle analysis was performed on a goniometer using the sessile drop method. On the other hand, water absorption properties of PVA and the nanocomposites were determined following the method described in ASTM D570-98. Dried films were immersed in distilled water for 24 h at room temperature. After regular time intervals, weight of the samples were measured and the percentage water absorption at a particular time t, was calculated using equation (2). (2) W a t e r a b s o r p t i o n ( % ) = W t − W o W o x 100 % where, Wo is the initial weight of the material, and Wt is the weight of the immersed sample at a particular time (t)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Mechanical properties,"3.1 Mechanical properties The tensile strength (TS) and tensile modulus (TM) of PVA and the nanocomposites are illustrated in Fig. 1 . As can be seen in Fig. 1a, the TS of pure PVA is about 29 MPa whereas TS of the PVA-NFC nanocomposite is about 40 MPa. Incorporation of 1% GE into the PVA-NFC system further raised the TS to about 48 MPa which represents an increment of about 66% with respect to pure PVA and about 19% compared to the PVA-NFC composite. However, at higher loading of GE (3 and 5 wt%), there is a drastic reduction in the TS value. Specifically, the TS of the nanocomposite reduced to about 22 and 19 MPa following the incorporation of 3% and 5 wt% GE content respectively. The percentage increase or decrease in the TS of the samples with respect to pure PVA is presented in Table 2 . Generally, homogeneity and strong interfacial bond within a nanocomposite should positively influence the TS [30]. Therefore, it is believed that the higher TS of the nanocomposite with 1 wt% GE content could be an indication of good interfacial interaction between PVA, NFC and GE at this loading. It also suggests better dispersion of the reinforcing filler as illustrated in Fig. 2 c. On the other hand, the drastic reduction in the TS values of the composite at higher GE wt% loading might be as a result of restacking of the GE particles due to strong van der Waals attraction as they come too close to each other at higher loadings. This will trigger serious agglomeration within the nanocomposite as illustrated in Fig. 2d and e, thereby resulting into ineffective transfer of stress between the matrix and the fillers [1,10]. This can be seen in the representative stress-strain curves of PVA and the different nanocomposite categories as illustrated in Fig. 3 . On the other hand, the TM in Fig. 1b revealed a significant increase in TM of the PVA-NFC system compared with pure PVA. This can be attributed to the stiffness imposed on PVA by the NFC. However, the incorporation of GE into the PVA-NFC system resulted into reduction in TM. Notwithstanding, the TM values of the nanocomposites are higher than pure PVA howbeit little. This is believed to be due to the influence of NFC within the nanocomposites. The percentage increase in TM of the nanocomposites with respect to PVA is included in Table 2. It is worthy of note that as the GE wt% content increases, the TM decreases further and this suggests that interfacial interaction between PVA and NFC might have been disrupted by the presence of GE. On the other hand, it could be as a result of agglomeration of GE particles within the nanocomposites due to van der Waals forces as illustrated in Fig. 2. Therefore, as the GE content increases, the influence of this attraction would become more pronounced and this might have contributed to the lower TM values at higher GE wt% content."
6,Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,"3.2 Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy The FTIR spectra of PVA and the nanocomposite are illustrated in Fig. 4 . The most notable peak as presented in the figure is the broad peak at 3000-3600 cm−1, which is a characteristic stretching vibration of –OH groups [32,33]. This represents the hydroxyl groups in the PVA polymeric unit. The other notable peaks include the absorption peak at 2800-3000 cm−1 which is an attribute of C–H stretching of methyl, methylene and methane moieties. On the other hand, the C–H deformation vibrations of the methyl, methylene and methane moieties can be seen at 1300-1500 cm−1, while the peak at 1650 cm−1 is attributed to the bound water. The peaks at 1419 and 850 cm−1 are due to the vibration of CH2 groups. The absorption peak at 1312 cm−1 represents the deformation of C–O–C groups whereas the peak at 1090 cm−1 is attributed to C–O stretching [1]. Generally, it can be seen that the incorporation of NFC and GE did not present significant changes to the spectra of PVA. However, it is well known that TEMPO treatment would incorporate carboxyl groups onto the NFC. Consequently, the peak at 1650 cm−1 in the spectra of PVA can be seen to slightly shift to a lower region in the nanocomposites. This is believed to be due to hydrogen bonding between the carboxyl groups (CO) introduced by TEMPO treatment on the NFC, and the –OH groups of PVA. In addition, the broad hydroxyl band in the spectra of PVA-NFC is an indication of inter-, and intra-molecular hydrogen bond formation emanating from the –OH groups of PVA and NFC [1], and the carboxyl groups on the NFC. Although this appears to be generally unaffected following the incorporation of GE, it is noteworthy that the –OH absorption band in the nanocomposites tend to become wider as the wt% GE composition increases. This is an indication of pronounced van der Waals interactions, over hydrogen bonding within the system [34]. Interactions between GE and other components of the system could further be confirmed by the decreased intensity and broadening of the peak at 1090 cm−1 in the spectra of PLA-NFC-GE systems compared to pure PVA, as stated in literature [35]. It is well known that a shift to lower wavenumber of the –OH peak is often accrued to presence of hydrogen bonds [36,37]. However, increased broadening of the –OH peaks as GE wt% content increased suggests a decreasing amount of hydrogen bonds within the system [36,37]. Invariably, this would influence the inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bond interactions between PVA and NFC within the composite. This might have contributed to the decrease in tensile strength of the PVA-NFC system as the GE wt% content increases."
7,Thermal properties,"3.3 Thermal properties The TGA and DTG spectra of GE, PVA and the nanocomposites are illustrated in Fig. 5 . Primarily, TGA was performed to assess the effects of graphene on the thermal stability of the PVA matrix. As can be seen from Fig. 5a, all the samples (except GE) revealed three-stage weight loss processes. The first stage, which occurred from 62 to 150 °C is attributed to loss of absorbed moisture. The second stage which represents a large degradation process occurred from 235 to 370 °C and it is attributed to the degradation of PVA [38]. It is worthy of note that at this degradation stage, incorporation of NFC reduced the onset of degradation, which can be accrued to possible degradation of the interface of PVA-NFC. On the other hand, incorporation of GE into the PVA-NFC system increased the onset of degradation which suggests increased stability of the nanocomposite due to presence of GE. The third stage of weight loss around 410–500 °C is believed to have resulted from further degradation of other components of the nanocomposite. The DTG curves of the samples are illustrated in Fig. 5b. The degradation temperature, T d , of the samples can be obtained from the DTG curve. However, it is well known that the T d of a material at 50% weight loss may be considered as a pointer to its structural destabilization. The corresponding T d values of the samples are included in Table 3 . From the T d values, it is evident that the incorporation of GE offered improved thermal stability to the nanocomposites. This could be attributed to possible interactions between the oxygen-containing groups of GE and –OH groups of NFC and PVA as reported in literature [38]. Specifically, as the wt% GE increased, the temperature for maximum weight loss increases. This is an indication that GE could help to delay the thermal degradation of PVA in GE-containing nanocomposites. As expected, an increasing trend can be seen for the amount of residue (%) after 550 °C (Table 3), as the graphene wt% content increases. This aligns with the thermal stability of pure GE nanoparticle, as illustrated by the TGA spectra of pure GE nanopowder (Fig. 3)."
8,Differential scanning calorimetric analysis,"3.4 Differential scanning calorimetric analysis The DSC thermograms of the heating curves of PVA and the nanocomposites are illustrated in Fig. 6 and the results are included in Table 3. It should be noted that only the first heating step was analyzed and reported herein due to the high tendency for the second heating ramp to be affected by polymer degradation [31]. As presented in Table 3, it can be seen that the incorporation of NFC resulted into little decrease in the melting temperature of PVA. This observation aligns with what was previously reported for PVA/nanocellulose composite [39], and it is believed to have resulted from the hydrophilicity of NFC particles. This might have increased the amount of water absorbed, after drying the film. It could also be as a result of the interface created between the PVA and NFC particles which might be more susceptible to the effects of heat. However, it is worthy of note that the decrease observed herein is very little (2 °C), compared to previous studies [31,39] and this can be accrued to the influence of TEMPO treatment of the NFC. Incorporation of GE seems not to present significant changes to the melting temperature of the PVA-NFC system, regardless of the wt% GE loading. On the other hand, the heat of melting (ΔH m ) of PVA was increased in the PVA-NFC system which represents an increase in the percentage crystallinity of PVA. This suggests that NFC might have acted as nucleation sites, thereby inducing heterogeneous nucleation in the PVA matrix [30]. However, incorporation of graphene resulted in a decrease in ΔH m of PVA-NFC-GE system which could be attributed to possible weakening of the PVA-NFC bonding [1]. Notwithstanding, the nanocomposite containing 1 wt% GE exhibited higher ΔH m than PVA which is an indication of higher extent of interaction with the polymer matrix, probably due to more even dispersion compared with other samples with higher wt% GE loading. The crystallinity of PVA in the nanocomposites was calculated as described in section 2.2.7 and the results are presented in Table 3. As can be seen in Table 3, it is evident that the crystallinity of PVA in the nanocomposites varies based on the composition. Specifically, the incorporation of NFC increased the crystallinity of the PVA in the PVA-NFC system perhaps due to nucleating effect of NFC on the PVA matrix as stated earlier. On the other hand, incorporation of 1 wt% GE lowered the crystallinity of the PVA-NFC system but the crystallinity was observed to be higher than pure PVA. This suggests that at 1 wt% GE loading, the nucleating ability of NFC was not adversely affected. It could also be an indication that the PVA-NFC bonding was not significantly disrupted. However, lower crystallinity values can be seen for the higher GE containing nanocomposites (3 and 5 wt% GE). This suggests a disruption in the nucleating activity of NFC within the nanocomposite. It could also be due to possible increase in the free volume within the nanocomposite [40], perhaps due to agglomeration of GE nanoparticles at higher loading as illustrated in Fig. 2, such that the growth of sperulites was hindered."
9,X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis,"3.5 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis The XRD patterns of PVA and the nanocomposites are illustrated in Fig. 7 . From the figure, the major characteristic peak of the GE nanosheets can be seen at 2ϴ = 26.5°, which indicates that the d-spacing aligns with the (002) plane of pristine graphite [1]. The somewhat broad peak obtained for this reflection is characteristic of turbostatic (randomly oriented) graphitic platelets. Interestingly, this is similar to what was previously reported [38]. As for PVA, the most conspicuous peak is evident at 2ϴ = 28.5° which represents the (201) plane of PVA. It is worthy of note that this is also evident in the diffractogram of PVA-NFC nanocomposite, indicating good interaction between PVA and NFC. However, in addition to this peak, the pattern of PVA-NFC reveals a notable peak at 2ϴ = 21.9° which is typical of cellulose I [41]. In the case of the tricomponent nanocomposites, the diffraction patterns can be seen to be largely dependent on the wt% GE content in the nanocomposite. Specifically, as the wt% GE increase, the peak at 2ϴ = 21.9° in the pattern of PVA-NFC can be seen to shift downwards to the lower angle. This suggests a decrease in the crystallinity of the nanocomposite as observed in the DSC results, perhaps due to increasing d-spacing. This might have emanated from possible interruption of the bonding between PVA and NFC due to incorporation of GE as confirmed through the DSC result. In fact, the characteristic peak of PVA decreased in intensity as the GE wt% increases which is an indication that incorporation of GE presented significant influence on the nanocomposite."
10,Wettability and water absorption properties,"3.6 Wettability and water absorption properties The wettability of PVA and the nanocomposites was investigated through the water contact angle analysis and the contact angle values of the different samples are presented in Table 4 . On the other hand, images of the water droplet on the different samples which was used to obtain the contact angles values are presented in Fig. 8 . It is evident from the water contact angle values presented in Table 4 that the hydrophilic property PVA is highly influenced by the properties of the filler. Specifically, the incorporation of NFC slightly increased the contact angle of PVA. It is well know that NFC has –OH groups which could lower its water contact angle. However, the TEMPO treatment used to obtain NFC in this study might have reduced the free –OH groups, thereby increasing its contact angle. On the other hand, the available –OH groups on the NFC might have been used for bond formation as evident through FTIR analysis, and this will reduce the hydrophilic tendencies of the resulting nanocomposite compared with pure PVA. This might be the reason for the higher contact angle of PVA-NFC compared with pure PVA. On the other hand, the contact angles of the GE containing nanocomposites are significantly increased. In fact, at just 1 wt% GE content, the contact angle of PVA was raised by about 117%. This was further increased as the wt% GE increased. This increase in contact angle values can be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of graphene. In a previous study, the contact angle of PVA was reportedly increased from 36° to 93° at 0.5 wt% GE content, and further increased to 97° at 1 wt% GE content [10]. These values are considered higher compared with what was obtained herein. However, the values obtained here are believed to have been be influenced by the presence of NFC in the GE containing nanocomposites. This is believed to have also influenced the water absorption values obtained for the different samples as presented in Fig. 9 . Notably, the presence of GE helped to reduce the water absorption of PVA. Hence, it can be inferred that incorporation of GE can help to enhance the water resistance properties of PVA."
11,Dynamic mechanical properties,"3.7 Dynamic mechanical properties The dynamic mechanical properties of PVA and the nanocomposites are summarized in Table 5 . As can be seen in the table, the storage modulus (Eʹ) value of PVA was significantly increased after the incorporation of NFC as evident through the higher Eʹ value of PVA-NFC. However, in the GE containing nanocomposites, a reduction in the Eʹ values was observed when compared with PVA-NFC nanocomposite. In fact at higher (>1 wt%) GE content, the Eʹ value dropped below that of pure PVA. It is well know that the Eʹ values indicate the elastic modulus with respect to elastic deformation of the nanocomposite. Therefore, the increase in Eʹ of PVA-NFC suggests increased stiffness which might have been imposed by the NFC on the PVA matrix. This would facilitate efficient transfer of stress between the matrix and filler such that the PVA would be able to accommodate higher mechanical constraints via recoverable viscoelastic deformation [30]. In addition, other factors such as interfacial adhesion, filler dispersion, type of filler and matrix type could influence the Eʹ values [30,40]. Hence the observed increase in Eʹ might be as a result of increased interaction between PVA and NFC, or perhaps due to better dispersion of NFC in the PVA matrix. This might also be the reason for increased tensile strength of PVA-NFC, compared with pure PVA. On the other hand, the decrease in Eʹ after incorporation of GE suggests possible decrease in the extent of interaction between PVA and NFC. Notwithstanding, it is interesting to note that the nanocomposite with 1 wt% GE revealed higher Eʹ compare with nanocomposites with 3 wt% and 5 wt% GE content. This could be attributed to possible agglomeration of GE particles as the wt% content increases due to increased van der Waals forces between the particles when they come too close to each other. Literature revealed that the tan δ values of composites can serve as a good indicative of the degree on interaction between the filler and the matrix. Specifically, a weak adhesion would yield higher tan δ values whereas stronger adhesion would produce lower tan δ values [42]. The tan δ values of PVA and the nanocomposites are included in Table 5. As can be seen from the table, PVA-NFC revealed lower tan δ peak value compared with other samples which suggest good interfacial interaction within the composites as stated earlier. However, the observed higher tan δ peak values of the GE containing nanocomposites in an indication of possible disruption of the PVA-NFC bonding. The tan δ curve is very important for accurate determination of the glass transition temperature, T g , which can be obtained as the temperature at the maximum tan δ peak. The T g values obtained from the tan δ curve (not shown) are included in Table 5. As can be seen in the table, the T g of the nanocomposites are higher than pure PVA. Generally, higher T g is an indication of decreased mobility of the polymer chain, which is most times as a result of strong interfacial adhesion. However, it was observed herein that the GE containing nanocomposites exhibited higher tan δ value despite their higher T g values compared with PVA. Therefore, the tan δ was further used to investigate the interfacial adhesion within the nanocomposites using the method described in literature [43]. Normally, strong interfacial adhesion would produce low adhesion factor (A) values while poor interfacial adhesion would generate higher A values. The A values of the samples were calculated using equation (3), and the values obtained are included in Table 5. (3) A d h e s i o n f a c t o r ( A ) = 1 1 − V f t a n δ c t a n δ p − 1 where, V f is the volume fraction of filler, tan δ p and tan δ c are the relative damping of pure polymer and nanocomposite respectively. Relative damping of the samples are obtained as the maximum tan δ peak at the T g [43], as presented in Table 5. From the A values presented in Table 5, it is evident that there is a reduction in the interfacial adhesion within the nanocomposites as the GE wt% content increases due to the higher A values. This further affirms the assumptions made earlier as regards possible agglomeration of GE particles as the wt% GE content increases."
12,Conclusions,"Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanocomposites were prepared by incorporating hybrid filler consisting of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and graphene (GE). The NFC was obtained through TEMPO treatment of pulp and it was used to stabilize aqueous suspension of GE nanoparticles. Different wt% content of GE (1, 3 and 5 wt%) was incorporated into the TEMPO treated NFC to generate the NFC-GE hybrid filler system. Mechanical test, XRD and FTIR results showed that there was good interaction between PVA and NFC. In addition, incorporation of GE into the PVA-NFC system resulted into some extent of interaction, mostly via van der Waals attraction. However, the interfacial bonding between PVA and NFC was significantly influenced by the wt% content of GE in the nanocomposite system. Notably, incorporation of 1 wt% GE offers desirable improvement in mechanical and dynamic mechanical properties of the resulting nanocomposites. On the other hand, higher wt% GE presents significant increase in thermal and water resistance properties. In addition, the T g of PVA was drastically increased at higher GE wt% content. However, calculated adhesion factor revealed that the increase in T g with respect to higher GE content does not necessarily depict good interfacial interaction among the component of the nanocomposites. Generally, the mechanical, thermal, crystallinity and dynamic properties of PVA were desirably enhanced at 1 wt% GE content and the produced nanocomposite can be used in different applications especially where good thermomechanical and water resistance properties required. Specifically, PVA nanocomposites films can be used in applications such as a packaging material, warp sizing, carrier in drug delivery, adhesives, component of biomedical materials and as paper coating agent."
