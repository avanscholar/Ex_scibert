0,Introduction,"Todays, development of electrospun nanocomposites reinforced polymer fiber materials with intention to stimulate interests in both academia and industry makes them highly attractive [1]. Electrospun nanofiber have great potential for synthesis of next-generation polymer nanofibers [2,3]. Continuity, diverse material choice, controlled diameter/structure, possible alignment/assembly, and mass production capability are comprehensive advantages of electrospun nanopolymers [3–5]. Inorganic nanofibers, with smaller pores and higher surface area than regular fibers, have enormous catalytic applications [6,7]. Despite enormous efforts devoted to explore industrial applications of electrospun nanofibers, there are limited attempts to employ these nanofibers for reinforcement in polymer nano-hybrids [8,9]. Among all polymers, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) due to its low cost, high hydrophilicity, and excellent chemical resistance has used in broad application areas. PVA is a synthetic water-soluble hydrophilic polymer and the degree of polymerization or the degree of hydrolysis can effect on its properties such as adhesives, emulsificantes, and paper industry applications [1,10]. Modified PVA with metal oxides, with different mechanical, thermal and chemical stability, has already been proven as an effective way to produce new materials with specific properties and high performances [11–13]. In many recent studies, iron nanoparticles (NPs) for environmental remediation have indicated excellent potentials [14,15]. Microwave assisted synthesis, ultrasonication assisted synthesis, coprecipitation, chemical reduction methods, and hydrothermal methods are the methods for iron oxide synthesis. While, the most commonly used conventional strategy for the synthesis of the nanoparticles are chemical physical and biological methods [16–18]. However, they need expensive instruments, high energy, usage of toxic reducing agents maintaining the cell culture, and recovery steps [19]. The undesirable features of traditional reagents and methods have forced chemists to use phyto-mediated synthesis to reduce the costs of chemical production [20,21]. Hence, the synthesis of nanoparticles using the plant extract has several advantages [22–24]. On continuing our work on the green catalytic system [25–29], bio α-Fe2O3 was synthesized using Sesbania sesban plant and molybdenum complex was supported on it and nanofiber of immobilized molybdenum complex on α-Fe2O3 in the presence of PVA was synthesized through electrospinning (PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB). As our acknowledgment, this work is the first report of catalytic potential of an electrospun nanofiber base on one transition metal complex in oxidation reactions. Here, we describe catalytic properties of PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB in the presence H2O2 as an ideal oxidant to aldehyde products and t-BuOOH as a common oxidant to produce the acid products."

A KOH solution (0.01 M) was then added drop wise (drop rate = 1 mL.min-1) at room temperature to reach the reaction pH to 9. 170 ml of the obtained extraction solution was added to 130 ml of distilled water and 200 ml of FeCl3.6H2O solution (0.05 M). The mixture of reaction was heated to 80 °C for 2.5 h. The resulting α-Fe2O3 was separated by an external magnet, washed with water and dried in oven under vacuum. The as-synthesized sample was heated by the furnace at 250 °C for 7 h [30]."
4,Synthesis of immobilized molybdeum complex on functionalized α-Fe2O3 (Fe2O3/MoSB),"3.2 Synthesis of immobilized molybdeum complex on functionalized α-Fe2O3 (Fe2O3/MoSB) A mixture of 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane (0.5 mmol, 0.1 mL) and triethylamine as a catalyst (0.01 mL, 0.07 mmol) was added to suspend iron oxide (0.1 g) in dry ethanol (20 mL) and was refluxed for 24 h.

The resulting product was dried under vacuum. 0.94 gr of chloro-functionalized iron oxide was added to 2.5 mg of 2-amino pyridine in ethanol (20 ml) and this reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C for 8 h. The resulting ligand (Fe2O3/SB) was separated through centrifugation at 300 rpm for 5 min and washed three times by ethanol and dried at room temperature [31,32]. 2.31 gr of ammonium hepta molybdate salt was added to suspension of supported ligand of iron oxide (0.2 gr) in 4 ml of distilled water and refluxed for 8 h at 80 °C. The F2O3/MoSB washed three times with distilled water and dried at room temperature."

The mixture of reaction was irradiated with ultrasound for 30 min. Prepared solution was placed under magnetic stirrer for 8 h at 80 °C. The electrospinning of final prepared solution was done at an electrical voltage of 25 kV at room temperature under atmospheric pressure. The polymer fibers were injected using a syringe needle (5 ml) with a needle [1.23 mm outer diameter (OD) and 0.83 mm internal diameter (ID)] at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/h. The grounded target was placed at 12 cm from the needle tip.
6,General procedure for oxidation of alcohols using H2O2,"3.4 General procedure for oxidation of alcohols using H2O2 To a mixture of alcohol (1 mmol) and electrospun PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB nanocomposite (0.003 g) under solvent free conditions, 0.6 mmol H2O2 (12 μL) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 7 h."

After completion of the reaction, 1 mL ethyl acetate was add and catalyst was separated by centrifugation. PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB nanocomposite as the isolated solid phase was dried under air and reused for next runs. According to the above-mentioned procedure, catalyst recovery was also considered in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol under solvent free conditions using t-BuOOH as an oxidant."
9,Result and discussion,"Bio iron oxide nanoparticles was synthesized by Sesbania sesban and these green α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were then allowed to react with an appropriate concentration of 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane to give chloro-functionalized α-Fe2O3. The obtained chloro-functionalized iron oxide was reacted with 2-amino pyridine to produce immobilized 2-amino pyridine on bio chloro-functionalized iron oxide (Fe2O3/SB). To this end, the reaction of Fe2O3/SB with ammonium heptamolybdate in water led to the formation of F2O3/MoSB. Nanofiber of PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB was synthesized by electrospinning of F2O3/MoSB base on polyvinyl alcohol as a polymer (Scheme 1 ). FT-IR spectra of PVA, Fe2O3/MoSB, and PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB were shown in Fig. 1 . In the case of PVA, the most intensive band that appeared at 3900 cm−1 corresponds to the asymmetric stretching vibrations of an alcoholic O-H. The bands observed at 1440 and 640 cm−1 are corresponded to the CH2 bending and stretching modes [8,10,33]. In the case of Fe2O3/MoSB, the C-O stretching vibration appeared at 1130 cm−1 [2,5,8]. The band observed at around 627–648 cm−1was assigned to the stretching vibrations of Metal-Oxygen (Fe-O) bond in this bio iron oxide nanoparticles [34]. The peaks observed at 2910, 2930 and 1475 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectrum of Fe2O3/MoSB was related to the stretching and bending of the CH2 bonds, respectively [35]. Si-O stretching bond was detected in the region 1000–1110 cm−1. A stretching vibrational about 3434 cm−1 are attached to the O-H surface. Observed peak at 1629 cm−1 is confirmed a stretch for the vibrational mode of water. It is the V2 bending mode of the water molecules adsorbing on the surface. In the FT-IR spectrum of PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB, additional stretches at 2957 and 2834 cm−1 are related to aryl C–H stretches. The amine group stretch is found at 1292 cm−1 (C-N). The peaks at 1610, 1496, and 763 cm−1for the 2-amino pyridine, and 462 cm−1 for Mo–N bond were indicated a minor amount of complex in the structure of PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB [36]. Therefore, FT-IR of PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB confirmed the presence of the supported molybdenum complex on bio-iron oxide nanoparticles in this nanocomposite. Also, EDAX measurements (see Fig. 2 ) provided the direct evidence for chemical analysis. The presence of Fe Mo, Si, Cl, C, and O were confirmed as elements in PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB. The strong signal was due to the alumina from the Al substrate on which the fibers were collected [2]. The weight percentage of each element shows in Table 1 . The high percentage of oxygen suggests the presence of PVA polymer with high number of OH groups in the sample. The thermal behavior of PVA and PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB composite nanofiber was analyzed through thermal gravimetric analysis (Fig. 3 , dash line) [37]. The thermal stability and content of organic functional groups on the surface were considered. The PVA nanofiber had three main weight loss stages: the first one, up to 210 °C was related to the evaporation of water and volatile compounds. From 230 to 380 °C, we have second stage corresponding to the polymer chain. At higher than 400 °C, the breakage the main chain of PVA was happened [38]. By comparison, the PVA nanofiber undergoes total thermal oxidation between 460 and 700 °C, the presence of Fe2O3/MoSB was confirmed. In fact, the remaining mass after the polymer decomposition in PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB is due to the molybdenum complex [39]. According to the TGA curves, the amount of transition metal complex in PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB is estimated to be 5%. In continuing our characterization of PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB composite nanofibrous, the TEM images of the pure nanofibers with different diameters showed the uniform structures (Fig. 4 a). When this nanocomposite nucleate and grow during the electrospinning process, the Fe2O3/MoSB move to the surfaces of the nanofibers PVA because of the internal radial orientation of the electrostatic field and the rapid evaporation of the solvents. In fact, Fig. 4a shows the high-resolution TEM image of the PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB nanofiber and the short distances of straight chain separated each other [40]. The PVA chains are elongated and self-oriented side by side along the fiber axis and the straight molecular segments in these chains are at least 40–70 nm long. Also, the SEM of PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB confirmed the irregular white and gray dots on the straight chain of PVA, which are Fe2O3/MoSB (Fig. 4b). The aggregation of the Fe2O3/MoSB was observed and the average size of them was estimated about 30 nm. Two-dimensional (Fig. 4c) and three-dimensional (Fig. 4d) AFM topography images of PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB were used to determine fiber compositional information. Representative AFM-phase was gave good information about surface morphology this nanofiber. AFM images were derived from 5.1 μ m * 5.1μ m scans part of the samples. The AFM-phase image (Fig. 4a) shows the aggregation of the hydrophobic parts of the immobilized molybdenum complex on iron oxide nanoparticles in the PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB [41,42]. Three-dimensional AFM topography image, 5.1 μ m2 *1.1 μm framework, showed that nanofibers with high porosity was formed [43]."
10,Green oxidation of alcohols catalyzed by PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB,"4.1 Green oxidation of alcohols catalyzed by PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB Catalytic potential of PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB was evaluated in the oxidation of alcohols as green chemistry point of view (Scheme 2 ). Different factors such as various temperatures, solvents, catalyst amounts, and oxidants were optimized in the oxidation of alcohols catalyzed by PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB nanofiber (Fig. 5 ). This nanocomposite was initially evaluated for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2 as ideal oxidant under solvent free conditions as a green media. This reaction did not proceed in the absence of the catalyst under any conditions [44]. While, PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB (0.003 g) was used into the reaction mixture, the conversion rate was enhanced significantly and benzaldehyde was obtained in 65% and 100% yield after 5 and 7 h at 80 °C, respectively. When the same amount of PVA, Fe2O3, and Fe2O3/MoSB was applied as heterogeneous catalysts in this green system. Trace, 20, 44% of related products were achieved, respectively. Virtually, no catalytic activity was observed in commonly used organic solvents. The examination of six solvents, such as dichloromethane (DCM), dichloroethane (DCE), acetonitrile (MeCN), methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), water (H2O) and solvent free conditions, showed that solventless and acetonitrile promoted the yield of the aldehyde products (Fig. 5a). Solvent free conditions were selected due to easy separation of the products and catalyst. On the other hand, the yields of reactions were crucially affected by the catalyst amounts. Best yield of aldehyde product was achieved by using 0.003 g of the electrospun nanofiber (Fig. 5b). It seems that higher temperatures up to 80 °C was required to furnish favored yields of the benzaldehyde under the catalytic influence of PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB (Fig. 5c). Under these optimum conditions, benzyl alcohol converted completely to the related aldehyde product within 7 h (Fig. 5d). To consider the oxidizing potential of other common oxidants, benzyl alcohol was subjected to the oxidation protocol using O2, H2O2, t-butylhydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), NaIO4, and Oxone®, TB (Fig. 5e). The interesting results were observed at the presence of PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB nanocomposite. At the same condition, benzyl alcohol was oxidized to benzaldehyde completely using H2O2, while, t-BuOOH was produced the benzoic acid as sole product. It seem that t-BuOOH is a strong oxidant, even more effective than hydrogen peroxide, therefore, it was used in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries instead of other organic peroxides [40]. Oxidation of benzyl alcohol under the optimized conditions (0.005 g of PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB under solvent free conditions at 80 °C within 6 h) using 0.06 mmol of t-BuOOH, gave solely benzoic acid in 100% yield (Support information, S1-S4). PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB was shown high efficiency and selectivity toward oxidation of a wide range of primary and secondary alcohols under optimized conditions using H2O2 and t-BuOOH (Table 2 ). The secondary alcohols were subjected in this green system and high conversion and excellent selectivity were achieved. Generally, the secondary alcohols were oxidized more difficult than of primary alcohols. Ester products were not observed in this clean strategy (Table 2, entries 1–4). A number of primary substituted benzylic alcohols, like benzyl alcohol, were oxidized smoothly to their corresponding aldehydes using H2O2 and acid products in the presence of t-BuOOH (Table 2, entries 5–12). It should be noted the electronic and steric demands of the substrate could effect on the yield of products. In fact, by changing the oxidant, the formation of acid or aldehyde products was controlled completely. Desired aldehyde and acid products were obtained in yields ranging from 85% to quantitative in the presence of both oxidants. Encouraged by the impressive results obtained for indicating its relative stability of PVA/Fe2O3/MoSB biopolymer in the heterogeneous oxidation system, the recycling of the catalyst was investigated (Fig. 6 ). After performing the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol with this biopolymer nanofiber under the present conditions, EtOAc was added to work-up. The catalyst was separated by the centrifuge from the reaction mixture, washed with EtOAc, dried at room temperature, and reused for a consecutive run under the same reaction conditions. The average yield of benzaldehyde for five consecutive runs was 95%, which clearly demonstrates the practical reusability of this catalyst. These benefits along with excellent conversion and selectivity of wide range of alcohols using the present green system were addressed one novel environmental and industrial strategy. Ultimately, we compared the result and conditions used in this work for oxidation of benzyl alcohol (Table 3 ) with some reports using catalysts. The superiority of biocatalyst is established with respect to solvent nature, temperature, oxidant, and reaction time."
11,Conclusion,"In conclusion, Iron oxide nanoparticles was prepared from Sesbania sesban plant and an electrospun nanofiber was synthesis from one novel molybdenum complex base on natural bio-iron oxide nanoparticles for the first time. This bio nanofiber was applied as a heterogeneous catalyst for selective oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols. High and excellent aldehyde and acid products was gained under solvent free conditions using H2O2 and t-BuOOH oxidants, respectively. A long-term stability, using ideal oxidant, easy work-up, and solventless show the great potential in scalability with relatively low catalyst loading. These features as concepts in economical and sustainable modern oxidation systems along with good reusability of the bio-catalyst render a practical strategy to address the environmental and industrial applications."
