0,Introduction,"Owing to finite resources and the emission of pollutants (including CO2, CO, C n H m , SO x , NO x , and ash), fossil fuels should be substituted with sustainable energy sources that do not cause pollution. As a sustainable energy source, hydrogen is a promising alternative to fossil fuels. Hydrogen is a clean, environmentally ‘friendly’ fuel that produces water instead of greenhouse gases when combusted. Furthermore, hydrogen has a high-energy yield (122kJ/g) that is about 2.75 times that of hydrocarbon fuels [1]. Conventional physicochemical methods for hydrogen production (e.g., water electrolysis or chemical cracking of hydrocarbons) require electricity derived from fossil fuels or nuclear fission; thus interest in biohydrogen production has increased substantially [2]. Biohydrogen production can be divided into two main categories: light-driven hydrogen production, in which solar energy is converted into H2, and fermentative hydrogen production, in which carbohydrates are directly fermented into H2, CO2, and organic acids such as butyrate and acetate without any external energy or electron acceptors. Fermentative production produces H2 at a higher rate (0.5–65.0L H2/L/d) than light-driven production (0.04–4.3L H2/L/d) [3]. In addition, fermentative production can convert organic wastes to more valuable energy resources [4]. Fermentative hydrogen production has been studied for a large group of pure cultures including species of Enterobacter [5], Bacillus [6], and Clostridium [7]. However, H2-producing microfloras obtained from natural sources and able to survive on non-sterile substrates contain mostly Clostridium spp. such as C. butyricum, C. acidosoli, C. tyrobutylicum, and C. acetobutylicum [8–10]. In response to unfavorable environmental conditions, these species form endospores, which are highly resistant to heat, toxic chemicals, starvation, lack of nutrients, high temperature, and ultraviolet (UV) and ionizing radiation [11]. The ability to form spores is useful for the selection of Clostridium spp. from natural environments [12]. However, the sensitivity of these bacteria to unstable conditions and the specific requirements for spore germination can be disadvantageous in continuous cultures [8,13] because substrate metabolism may be changed from H2 production to the production of ethanol and lactate [3,11]. Indeed, in some previous studies, long term culture under nonsterile conditions caused a population shift from H2-producing bacteria to H2-consuming or non-H2-producing bacteria such as acetogens, propionate producers, lactate producers, and methanogens [14–17]. As a first step to overcome such instability and to provide high H2-producing efficiency under conditions of continuous operation, design parameters should be defined clearly [3,8]. In recent years, the results of studies of continuous hydrogen fermentation in which anaerobic microflora were used led to the optimization of design parameters such as a temperature (30–36°C), pH (5.0–6.5), and hydraulic retention time (HRT; 8–12h) for the fermentation of simple substrates [10,17–20]. However, the effect of substrate concentration on continuous operation has not been addressed, even though this is a very important parameter in determining the economic and technical feasibility of fermentative hydrogen production [2,3,8]. Sufficient substrate is required to activate germination and to prevent re-sporulation in cultivated spore-forming bacteria [11,13]. On the other hand, H2 production has been reported to decrease in batch experiments at an initial sucrose concentration between 3.5 and 7.5g COD/L owing to the inhibition of either the substrate or the product [21,22]. To date, most successful continuous fermentation studies have been performed at constant inlet carbohydrate concentrations of 10–20g COD/L [10,17–20]. Although Liu and Fang [23] observed continuous hydrogen production at inlet sucrose concentrations of 4.8–19.8g COD/L, the effect of substrate concentration was not clear because HRTs were changed simultaneously with the substrate concentration. Therefore, little is known about long-term stable reactor operation over a wide range of substrate concentrations. In this study, the effect of substrate concentration on continuous fermentative hydrogen production was investigated using anaerobic microflora. A continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) was operated while adjusting the sucrose concentration stepwise from 30 to 10g COD/L and then from 10 to 60g COD/L for 271 days. The microbial community was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified V3 region of 16S rDNA."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge,"2.1 Seed sludge The seed sludge was obtained from an anaerobic digester at a local wastewater treatment plant. The pH, alkalinity, and concentration of volatile suspended solids (VSS) of the sludge were 7.6, 2.83g CaCO3/L, and 5.5g/L, respectively. The seed sludge was heat-treated (90°C, 10min) to inhibit the bioactivity of hydrogen consumers and to activate anaerobic spore-forming bacteria such as Clostridium spp."
3,Feed composition,"2.2 Feed composition Sucrose was used as the model carbohydrate substrate. The concentrations of NH4Cl, KH2PO4, and FeCl2·4H2O were controlled to obtain a COD:N:P:Fe ratio of 100:5:1:0.33 [8]. The feed also contained 0.1% peptone, 1g/L NaHCO3, 100mg/L MgCl2·6H2O, 10mg/L Na2MoO4·4H2O, 0.075mg/L CaCl2·2H2O, and 12.5mg/L MnCl2·6H2O [10,14]."
4,Reactor operation,"2.3 Reactor operation A CSTR reactor with a working volume of 5.0L was installed in a room that was held at a constant temperature of 35±1°C. The reactor was connected to a gas collection cylinder that was placed in an acidified saturated salt solution. The reactor was inoculated with 1.5L of the heat-treated seed sludge and was filled with the feed to the working volume. Subsequently, the headspace of the reactor was flushed with nitrogen gas for 1min. The reactor was then agitated at 200rpm. To germinate endospores, the pH was kept at 5.4±0.1 with 3N potassium hydroxide [20]. When the cumulative H2 production was equivalent to 0.5mol H2/mol hexoseadded, the reactor was switched from batch operation mode to continuous operation mode. The HRT was maintained at 12h. Continuous operation was started with 30g sucrose COD/L. After acclimation, the sucrose concentration was decreased stepwise from 30 to 20, 15, and 10g COD/L, and was then increased stepwise from 10 to 15, 20, 30, 35, 40, 50, and 60g COD/L. The interval between each step was at least 20 days."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The volume of biogas that was produced was measured by the water displacement method. The hydrogen content in biogas was measured by gas chromatography (Gow Mac series 580, GOW-MAC Instrument Co., Bethlehem, PA) using a thermal conductivity detector and a stainless steel column (1.8m×3.2mm) packed with molecular sieve 5A, using N2 as the carrier gas. The CH4, N2, and CO2 contents were measured using the same gas chromatograph with a stainless steel column (1.8m×3.2mm) packed with Porapak Q (80/100 mesh), using helium as the carrier gas. The temperature of the injector, detector, and column were kept at 80, 90, and 50°C, respectively, for all gas chromatography measurements. Aliphatic fatty acid (C2–C6) and lactate were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (SpectraSYSTEM P2000, Spectra-Physics, CA) with a UV (210nm) detector and an Aminex HPX-97H column (300mm×7.8mm), using 0.005M H2SO4 as the mobile phase. The concentration of aliphatic alcohol was measured using a high performance liquid chromatograph (DX-600, Dionex, Wommelgem, Belgium) equipped with an electrochemical detector (ED50A) and a Dionex CarboPac PA10 column (250mm×4mm), using 0.01 M NaOH as the mobile phase. The liquid samples were filtered with a 0.45-μm membrane filter before injection into the HPLC column. Chemical oxygen demands (COD), suspended solids (SS), and VSS were quantified using standard methods [24]. The sucrose concentration was measured by the phenol-sulfuric acid method at UV wavelengths of 480, 484, and 490nm [10]. To characterize the microbial community, DNA in mixed liquor samples was extracted immediately using the Ultraclean Soil DNA kit (Cat # 12800-50; Mo Bio Laboratories, Solana Beach, CA), which is a highly efficient means of extracting DNA from environmental samples [25]. The 16S rDNA fragments were stored at −20°C before being amplified by PCR. The region corresponding to positions 357F and 518R in the 16S rDNA of Escherichia coli was amplified by PCR using the forward primer EUB357f (5′-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) with a GC clamp (5′-CGCCCGCCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGGCCCGCCGCCCCCGCCCC-3′) at the 5′ end to stabilize the melting behavior of the DNA fragments and the reverse primer UNIV518r (5′-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′). PCR amplification was carried out in an automated thermal cycler (MWG Biotech, High Point, NC). Initial denaturation was at 94°C for 4min; this was followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 40s and annealing at 55°C for 40s. Each annealing step was followed by extension at 72°C for 1min except the final extension step, which was 8min. The PCR product was loaded onto a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide to determine the size, purity, and concentration of DNA. Subsequently, DGGE was performed with the DCode Universal Mutation Detection system (Bio-Rad, USA) [9]. The PCR samples were applied directly to 7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in 1×TAE buffer (20mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.4), 10mM acetate, 0.5mM Na2EDTA) with a denaturing gradient that ranged from 40 to 60%. The gradient gel was cast with a gradient delivery system (Model 475, BioRad). Electrophoresis was carried out at 60°C and at a constant voltage of 70V. After 8h of electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide for 30min before being visualized on a UV transilluminator. The bands of interest were excised from the gel and were immersed in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8) for 24h. The eluted DNA was reamplified by PCR with the forward primer EUB357f without a GC clamp and the reverse primer UNIV518r. The product was then purified using the Millipore MultiScreen Vacuum Manifold. All purified PCR products were sequenced with primer EUB357f using the ABI PRISM Big Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions [26]. A search for the closest reference microorganisms in the GenBank database using the partial 16S rDNA sequences was carried out with the BLAST program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/) [27]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen production,"3.1 Hydrogen production Hydrogen production in the presence of 30g sucrose COD/L was stable from day 9 to 20 (Fig. 1 ). During the pseudo-steady state, 1.30mol of H2 were generated per mol of hexoseadded. H2 production decreased substantially from day 21 to 27, and this was accompanied by fluctuations in sludge growth, sucrose degradation, and organic acid production. The reactor reached a steady state at day 35, and this persisted up to day 54 with a H2 yield of 1.09mol H2/mol hexoseadded, 62.5% H2 content, 2.0g/L of VSS, 88.3% sucrose degradation efficiency, and 18.4g total organic acid COD/L. The sucrose concentration was reduced stepwise to 10g COD/L. The H2 yield per mol of hexoseadded and the H2 content decreased as the concentration of sucrose decreased, although the sucrose degradation efficiency was consistently over 97%. From day 121, the sucrose concentration was increased stepwise to 15, 20, and 30g COD/L. This increased the H2 yield and H2 content. Subsequently, the sucrose concentration was increased stepwise to 60g COD/L. This was associated with a decrease in the H2 yield, H2 content, and sucrose degradation efficiency. At the same time, sludge and total organic acid concentrations did not increase. Fig. 2 summarizes the effects of the inlet sucrose concentration on the H2 yield per hexoseadded, the H2 yield per hexoseconsumed, the H2 production rate, and the specific H2 production rate. The maximum values were 1.09mol H2/mol hexoseadded, 1.22mol H2/mol hexoseconsumed, 7.65L H2/L/d, and 3.80L H2/g VSS/d, respectively, at 30g sucrose COD/L. These values are similar to the maximum values of the same parameters (0.72–2.26mol/mol hexoseadded, 0.75–2.52mol H2/mol hexoseconsumed, 1.6–26.9L H2/L/d, and 1.2–21.3L H2/g VSS/d) reported for continuous operation using either pure or mixed cultures [9,18,20,21,28]. The H2 yield per hexoseconsumed decreased sharply at sucrose concentrations below 20g COD/L, which suggested that sucrose was converted to end-products other than H2 and/or that H2 was consumed by interspecies transfer. The methane content of the biogas was below the detection limit (0.06%) throughout the whole operation period, which indicated that electrons from sucrose were converted to other fermentation products such as organic acid and alcohol. As bacterial growth kinetics depend directly on the concentration of the substrate remaining in a CSTR, low remaining sucrose concentrations (<0.6g COD/L) might cause a metabolic shift. However, at sucrose concentrations over 35g COD/L, the H2 yield per hexoseconsumed did not decrease. The H2 yield per hexoseconsumed was maintained above 1.00mol, which indicated that the substrate metabolism was not much different from that at 30g sucrose COD/L. However, the H2 yield per hexoseadded decreased to 0.38mol H2/mol hexoseadded owing to low sucrose degradation efficiency. The specific H2 production rate decreased at sucrose concentrations over 35g COD/L, which implied that microbial activity was inhibited within this range of sucrose concentrations. Mizuno et al. [17] and Van Ginkel et al. [22] suggested that H2 production might be lower at high substrate concentrations as a result of the product inhibition of hydrogen and organic acids. In our study, however, neither the H2 content nor organic acids affected the reactor performance, because they did not increase at sucrose concentrations of 35–60g COD/L. High remaining sucrose concentrations (>8.8g COD/L) might have resulted in substrate inhibition of microbial activity."
8,Product distribution,"3.2 Product distribution Sucrose was converted to H2, soluble fermentation products, and biomass. Soluble fermentation products included n-butyrate, acetate, lactate, ethanol, trace amounts of formate, propionate, isobutyrate, n-valeate, isovalerate, n-caproate, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, and sec-butanol. Table 1 shows that n-butyrate (28.9–50.3%) was the major product. Two moles of H2 could be produced together with 1mol of n-butyrate from 1mol of hexose as shown in Eq. (1). (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → C H 3 C H 2 C H 2 CO O − + 2 HC O 3 − + 3 H + + 2 H 2 Δ G 0 ′ = − 254 kJ / mol As the inlet sucrose concentration was reduced from 30 to 10g COD/L, the n-butyrate composition decreased from 47.1 to 28.9%. At the same time, acetate increased from 5.1 to 40.0%. According to the stoichiometry, 4mol of hydrogen could be produced with 2mol of acetate from 1 mol of hexose, as shown in Eq. (2). (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 4 H 2 O → 2 C H 3 CO O − + 2 HC O 3 − + 4 H + + 4 H 2 Δ G 0 ′ = − 206 kJ / mol From Eq. (2), more hydrogen would be generated with acetate production, but this was not observed. A simultaneous increase in the acetate composition and a decrease in H2 conversion has also occurred in previous studies in which mixed cultures were used [14,15,29]. Acetogens, which produce acetate from H2 and CO2 as shown in Eq. (3), might be selected in this case. There was no significant production of propionate or methane, and therefore acetate production according to Eq. (3) would be the main pathway by which gaseous H2 was consumed in this study. Some acetogens (C. scatologens, C. magnum, C. coccoides, Sporomusa ovata, etc.) are spore-forming bacteria [13]. As shown in Eq. (4), acetogens could also utilize carbohydrates, thereby competing with H2-producing Clostridium spp. [29]. (3) 4 H 2 + 2 HC O 3 − + H + → C H 3 CO O − + 4 H 2 O Δ G 0 ′ = − 105 kJ / mol (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 3 C H 3 CO O − + 3 H + Δ G 0 ′ = − 311 kJ / mol When the inlet sucrose concentration was increased to 15, 20, and 30g COD/L, the compositions of n-butyrate and acetate at each concentration were the same as the equivalent sucrose concentration during the preceding decrease from 30 to 20 and 15g sucrose COD/L. At sucrose concentrations over 30g COD/L, the acetate composition was less than 7.9%. The lactate composition ranged from 8.6 to 13.4% when the sucrose concentration was over 20g COD/L. Carbohydrate degradation to lactate did not lead to the production of H2 as shown in Eq. (5). Lactate-producing bacteria, including spore-formers such as Bacillus racemilacticus [31] and non-spore-formers such as Lactobacillus paracasei [16], would compete with H2-producing Clostridium spp. for carbohydrates. H2-producing Clostridium spp. also might produce lactate instead of H2/n-butyrate [13]. The composition of ethanol, which was produced from carbohydrate as shown in Eq. (6), was always in the range of 7.4–10.6%. In batch cultures of Clostridium spp., ethanol production generally follows H2 production [13]. However, it was reported that small amounts of ethanol could be produced simultaneously with successful H2 production during continuous operation [10,15,18]. (5) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 C H 3 CH ( OH ) CO O − + 2 H + Δ G 0 ′ = − 198 kJ / mol (6) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 C H 3 C H 2 OH + 2 H + + 2 HC O 3 − Δ G 0 ′ = − 225 kJ / mol It has been reported that an n-butyrate/acetate (B/A) ratio greater than 2.6 indicates efficient H2 production by anaerobic microflora [15,30]. In this study, the B/A ratio was greater than 4.0 at sucrose concentrations >20g COD/L, which implies that H2-producing metabolism was dominant. The relationship between the B/A ratio and H2 was also confirmed as shown in Fig. 3 . In this study, the B/A ratios of 1.6–9.3 were proportional to the H2 yield per hexoseconsumed. The B/A ratio could be a quantitative indicator of substrate metabolism and H2 production by anaerobic microflora. The following Eq. (7) was useful to determine the observed sludge yield in this study. Fig. 4 illustrates that the sludge yield value (0.080g VSS/g COD) was smaller than the yields of H2-producing granular sludge (0.10–0.18g VSS/g COD) [10,18]. The COD/VSS ratio of sludge was 1.4±0.2, which indicates that about 11% of sucroseconsumed was converted to sludge. (7) Y obs = X S 0 − S where Y obs is observed sludge yield (gVSS/g COD), X is biomass concentration (g VSS/L), S 0 is inlet sucrose concentration (g COD/L), and S is effluent sucrose concentration (g COD/L)."
9,Analysis of microflora population,"3.3 Analysis of microflora population Samples of sludge were obtained at sucrose concentrations of 10g COD/L (day 120), 30g COD/L (day 179), and 60g COD/L (day 271). Fig. 5 and Tables 2 and 3 contain the DGGE profiles of these samples, sequence affiliations of the major bands, and substrate metabolism, respectively. All seven bands obtained from the sample at 30g sucrose COD/L were related to H2-producing Clostridium spp. such as C. tyrobutyricum (band 1), C. acetobutylicum (bands 2 and 3), C. acidosoli (bands 5 and 6), and C. butyricum (bands 9 and 10) [32–34]; this was consistent with the high rate of H2 production and the B/A ratio at this inlet concentration of sucrose. Four bands were obtained from the sample at 10g sucrose COD/L, three of which were affiliated with H2-producing Clostridium spp. (C. tyrobutyricum, C. acetobutylicum, and C. acidosoli) and one of which (band 7) was related to a spore-forming acetogen, C. scatologenes [29]. The presence of the aforementioned acetogen might explain the high concentration of acetate and the low H2 yield per hexoseconsumed at this concentration of sucrose. From the sample at 60g sucrose COD/L, six bands were associated with H2-producing Clostridium spp. (C. tyrobutyricum, C. acetobutylicum, C. acidosoli, and C. butyricum, C. saccharobutylicum) and one band (band 6) was related to a spore-forming lactic acid bacterium, B. racemilacticus [31]. The latter bacterium might have caused the slight increase in lactate and the decreases in H2 and n-butyrate at sucrose concentrations greater than 30g COD/L. For sustainable H2 production, hydrogen consumers and carbohydrate competitors should be eliminated from the microflora. In this study, the heat-treatment of seed sludge was sufficient to exclude methanogens, even in long-term operation. However, some acetogens and lactate producers survived because they were spore-forming bacteria. Careful control of the design parameters, including substrate concentration, is necessary to suppress the activity of such bacteria."
