0,Introduction,"Sunlight, the largest source of renewable energy available to humans, falls primarily onto the open ocean. Harnessing this solar energy in order to produce hydrogen could potentially lead to the development of a large-scale secondary energy source that is clean, storable, and transportable. A variety of methods are used for solar hydrogen production, including a two-step method that uses solar cells and water electrolysis, a water-splitting method using a photoelectrode, and a water-splitting method using a photocatalyst [1, 2]. Technological advancements that aim to achieve high conversion efficiency and low cost are being actively pursued. The ultimate goal of the photocatalytic method is to develop a technology for splitting pure water using a single photocatalyst, but achieving high conversion efficiency will likely entail considerable effort. Photocatalytic hydrogen production from water with organic sacrificial agents added to it is an economical alternative that can be implemented in the near future [3, 4]. Many studies have examined the impact of electrolytes on the reactions during water-splitting or hydrogen production using a sacrificial agent [5–13]. Some of the studies have examined hydrogen production using synthesized or natural seawater. We propose a method to utilize glycerol, a byproduct/waste material from biodiesel production, as a sacrificial agent, and conduct photocatalytic reactions using Pt/TiO2 settled in a granular state rather than as a conventional powder suspension [14]. The advantages of this method are the reduced costs of sacrificial agents and energy required for stirring as well as durability against dissolved oxygen (DO) in equilibrium with air. Another advantage of the method is the easy handling of granular photocatalysts. The method should be able to easily separate the liquid after the reaction, to repeatedly use in batch mode, and to apply for continuous flow reaction. Taking advantage of these features, we experimentally examined the durability of the photocatalyst with respect to seawater constituents and DO. We conducted repeated reaction within the seawater solution and investigated the impacts of seawater constituents. We also examined the extended impact of DO using a continuous bubbling reactor up to the DO value through bubbling with pure oxygen."
1,Experimental,Granular Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts were prepared according to the previous study [14]. The activity of the photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution was evaluated using a closed batch reactor and a bubbling reactor. The detailed information was described in the Supporting Information.
2,Results and discussion,
3,Impacts of seawater constituents,"3.1 Impacts of seawater constituents Fig. 1 (a) shows the comparison of pure water and seawater as solvents for the aqueous glycerol solution during H2 production using granular Pt/TiO2. Both H2 and CO2 linearly increase in production with time. The H2 production rate (RH2), calculated from the slope of the line, roughly halved from 46.3 μmol h−1 in pure water (Reaction 1, Supporting information) to 23.6 μmol h−1 after seawater addition (Reaction 2). The reduction in the activity of the TiO2-based photocatalyst with the addition of electrolytes such as NaCl and seawater has been reported and has been explained by the adsorption-inhibiting effects of the electrolyte layer formation [5, 13], the scavenging of holes with chlorides [6, 11], and the interaction of Mg2+ in seawater [8]. In the case of our granular photocatalyst, considerable flocculation in the photocatalyst granules was observed during the 2 h after the seawater had been added. Fig. 1(b) shows the results of another set of reactions involving mixed quartz sand and granular Pt/TiO2. Reaction 1 (before the addition of seawater) and Reaction 2 (after the addition of seawater) had similar photocatalytic activities as those shown in Fig. 1(a) and similar particle flocculation as that observed in Reaction 2. The activity was notably restored in Reaction 2′ (S1.5, Supporting information) after the shaking of the reaction vessel, which enhanced deflocculation of the flocculated granules by physical collision with quartz sand. These results show that the decreased activity in seawater was mainly caused by the flocculation of granules. In both pure water and seawater, CO2 comprised almost all the product gases other than H2, and CO and CH4 were below 0.1%. Fig. 1(b) shows the same trend of CO2 formation as that of H2, i.e., decreasing after stabilizing in seawater and increasing after shaking with quartz sand, which indicates the influence of photocatalyst flocculation. Despite the presence of air, there was relatively little CO2 formation from glycerol oxidization, and large H2 production. The hydrogen selectivity (S H2), defined as the concentration of H2 in gaseous products, was 89–92% in Fig. 1(a) and (b). Under the pretreatment conditions utilizing powder suspension and inert gas, continuing the photocatalytic reaction until the glycerol was entirely consumed resulted in a hydrogen selectivity of 70%, which corresponds to the stoichiometric ratio of the photo-reforming equation expressed as [15]: C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3H 2 O → 7H 2 + 3CO 2 This experiment employed a high glycerol concentration, 1.09 mol L–1, a condition that left behind unreacted glycerol. Previous work has indicated that when using alcohols as sacrificial agents, aldehydes form from simple dehydrogenation and become the primary product [16, 17]. We hypothesize that in the present reaction, both H2 and aldehydes/ketones (glyceraldehyde or dihydroxyacetone) form from simple dehydrogenation [18]. We also examined the effect of seawater dilution on the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 2 ). The supernatant in Reaction 2 was repeatedly replaced using the solution of glycerol in pure water (Supporting information). The analysis of the solution after each reaction revealed a decrease in Na+ concentration by approximately 1/10 each iteration, in agreement with the dilution. At the same time, the H2 production rate increased and approached the reaction rate for pure water (Reaction 1); Reaction 8 had the same rate as Reaction 1 (Fig. 2, inset). We found a linear relationship (shown in Fig. 2) between the logarithm of Na+ concentration and R H2. There was obvious deflocculation of particles with declining Na+ concentration. In Reaction 8, we observed that the flocculation almost disappeared as Reaction 1. We conclude that the seawater constituents did not cause irreversible catalytic poisoning to the photocatalyst, because the Reaction 8 activity reached the same level as Reaction 1."
4,Impact of oxygen in the pretreatment gas in closed batch reaction,"3.2 Impact of oxygen in the pretreatment gas in closed batch reaction We examined the impact of changes in oxygen partial pressure in the pretreatment gas (P O2), caused by oxygen and nitrogen bubbling, on the photocatalytic reaction under glycerol aqueous solution with DO (Supporting information); the results on the granular Pt/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 3 . There was selective production of H2 for all partial pressures of oxygen. The rate of H2 production (R H2) gradually decreased and rate of CO2 production (R CO2) slightly increased with increases in P O2. S H2 levels were 84.8% during air bubbling pretreatment (P O2 = 20 kPa). Surprisingly, even under oxygen pretreatment conditions (P O2 = 99 kPa), we observed a R H2 of 17.4 μmol h−1, which corresponds to about 2/3 the level during nitrogen bubbling. In the suspension conditions of conventional powder photocatalysts, oxygen bubbling is performed for the oxidative decomposition of organic matter in water. We can see that the oxidative decomposition of H2 is extremely suppressed under the granular, non-stirred conditions in this study. The rate of O2 consumption, –R O2, was almost zero under the N2 bubbling pretreatment conditions (P O2 = 0 kPa), while R CO2 was not (3.6 μmol h−1). We believe that CO2 was not produced from the oxidation by the DO, but is a product of photo-reforming, using H2O as the oxygen source. There were very small increases in R CO2 even with increases in oxygen partial pressure. Even under pure oxygen conditions, this figure was at most 1.4 times pure nitrogen conditions. On the other hand, –R O2 increases significantly, and reaches –R O2 = 34 μmol h−1 under pure oxygen conditions. This indicates an oxidation reaction from DO. If we consider a case where only the complete oxidation of glycerol into CO2 occurs, we can express this reaction as: C 3 H 8 O 3 + 7 / 2 O 2 → 3CO 2 + 4H 2 O –R O2 should be about 1.2 times R CO2 based on the stoichiometric ratio, but it greatly exceeds this estimate under the pure oxygen condition in Fig. 3, at 6.8 times. This difference provides further evidence for the formation of partially oxidized products of glycerol and their accumulation in water. The above results clarify the dependence of P O2 on the photocatalytic reaction rate. However, the following problems remain: (1) P O2 measures the gas-phase oxygen, while the oxygen dissolved in the water contributes to the photocatalytic reaction. We must calculate the dependence of DO on the reaction rate. (2) To achieve (1), it is desirable for the amount of DO to remain constant during the reaction, rather than the method where DO decreases from consumption during the reaction. (3) To compare the conventional method using a powdered photocatalyst suspension, it is necessary to stir the solution inside the small reaction vessel with a magnetic stirrer, and we cannot irradiate the light from below as in the above measurement."
5,Photocatalytic reaction with continuous bubbling under powder suspension conditions,"3.3 Photocatalytic reaction with continuous bubbling under powder suspension conditions We solved the problems described above and controlled the DO concentration to remain constant, and conducted the same examination in the granular settled and powder suspension condition, using a continuous bubbling reactor (Supporting information). The correlation between oxygen concentration P O2 of the bubbling gas and DO concentration was confirmed in advance from a separate experiment without using photocatalysts. The dependence of R H2 and R CO2 on the DO concentration in the reaction under the powder suspension conditions with stirring is shown in Fig. 4 . We initiated the reaction with nitrogen bubbling, added oxygen into the bubbling gas, and gradually increased the DO every 35 min. For each condition, we calculated DO from the P O2 levels measured from the gas outlet of the reactor. After completing the reaction with oxygen gas bubbling (DO ~ 35 mg L−1), we switched the bubbling gas back to nitrogen and carried out a reaction; the data for the latter reaction is indicated with closed symbols in Fig. 4. The DO level during the first nitrogen bubbling was about 1.0 mg L−1. Under these conditions, measured R H2 and R CO2 were 110–120 μmol h−1 and 14–17 μmol h−1, respectively, and S H2 was high, at 88–91%. We verified that high glycerol concentrations were correlated with high H2 selectivity, regardless of the photocatalyst form (powder or granular). Under powder suspension conditions, R H2 abruptly decreased, and R CO2 increased as DO increased. Under the conditions corresponding to air bubbling, i.e., DO measured ~8 mg L−1, R H2 declined below 4 μmol h−1 and R CO2 reached the maximum of 160–180 μmol h−1. In the absence of DO, H+ receives electrons on the Pt surface and forms H2. However, as DO levels increase there is a preferential reduction of O2, forming super oxide anions (O2 − ), which we hypothesize oxidized H2 to H2O and decomposed the carbon chain to generate CO2 [14]. Furthermore, when DO increased, R H2 dropped to nearly zero and R CO2 decreased, reaching an approximate constant at 110–120 μmol h−1. We believe the aforementioned maximum value of R CO2 was achieved once the partial oxidation product of glycerol, which had accumulated in the liquid due to DO concentrations conditions below these levels, completely oxidized into CO2 under air bubbling conditions. There was no formation of H2 during pure oxygen bubbling, but H2 levels close to the initial amount were produced once again when we subsequently conducted pure nitrogen bubbling, which verified that irreversible deterioration of photocatalysts did not occur. Following the photocatalytic reaction, we sampled a small amount of the photocatalytic suspension and measured its turbidity after dilution, and we estimated the suspension turbidity during the reaction in Fig. 4 as 13,300. Another reason for R H2 reaching zero at DO > 8 mg L−1 is that the light only reach near the reactor wall on the irradiated surface under such concentrated suspension conditions. Thus there was large impact from dark reactions, wherein the generated H2 reacted with O2 and reverted to water [14]."
6,Photocatalytic reaction with continuous bubbling under granular settled conditions,"3.4 Photocatalytic reaction with continuous bubbling under granular settled conditions Fig. 5 shows the results from conducting photocatalytic reactions under granular settled conditions, which are completely different from the powder suspension results in Fig. 4. Instead, the results are similar to Fig. 3, a reaction also conducted with granular settled conditions. The first pure nitrogen bubbling showed a very high level of R H2, at 140–150 μmol h−1. When we compare this to the powder suspension conditions in Fig. 4, S H2 is almost equal and R H2 is clearly higher. The two conditions had the same irradiation position and Pt/TiO2 weight, which clearly shows the potential for sufficiently and effectively using irradiated light for photocatalytic reactions under granular settled conditions, rather than the conventional powder suspension conditions. When DO increased, there was a somewhat large decrease in R H2 until 8 mg L−1 of DO. Subsequently, R H2 gradually decreased and R CO2 slightly increased, following the same pattern as Fig. 4. Even under pure oxygen bubbling conditions, DO measured ~35 mg L−1, R H2 maintained ~60% of the pure nitrogen bubbling conditions, and S H2 levels were high, at 78–81%. This was consistent with the 78% seen in Fig. 4. These results indicate that the granular photocatalysts used in hydrogen production possess a strong durability under DO conditions. The lack of growth in R CO2 levels despite high DO levels, indicates a suppression of O2 reduction on the Pt surface, which should preferentially occur over proton reduction from the aspect of redox potential. Because the primary particle size of the utilized TiO2 (P25) is ca. 20 nm, there are many gaps in the primary particle coagulants that constitute the secondary particles [14]. This is likely due to the local anoxic conditions created within these gaps and particle vicinities due to hydrogen production reactions. After completing the oxygen bubbling reactions, we switched back to pure nitrogen bubbling; the results are indicated with closed symbols in Fig. 5. The value decreased ~10% from the first value. The supernatant liquid was somewhat cloudy after the reaction was completed, with a turbidity of 48. The decline in activity during this period can be explained by the turbidity of the supernatant liquid, as we observed in a prior study [14]. In this experiment, the reactor was held under non-stirred conditions. However, it is possible that the granular photocatalysts were moved by bubbling in their vicinity, causing part of the granule to collapse, and rendering the solution slightly cloudy. To maintain stable long-term photocatalytic activity under granular settled conditions, we believe it will be effective to enhance the mechanical strength, such as by adding a binder, at the time of granulation."
7,Conclusion,"Pt/TiO2 granular photocatalysts showed reduced photocatalytic activity in seawater mainly because flocculation depended on the electrolyte concentration, which was diminished by shaking with premixed quartz sand. We can potentially further mitigate this phenomenon by fixing the granular photocatalysts to the substrate. In anoxic solution via inert gas bubbling, the rate of H2 production is higher under granular settled conditions than conventional powder suspension conditions, even non-stirred. Furthermore, this photocatalyst showed very high durability to DO. Even for aqueous glycerol solutions with DO concentrations in equilibrium with pure oxygen, the rate of H2 production was maintained at over 60% that of pure nitrogen, and hydrogen selectivity in the product gases was over 78%. The results show the effective suppression of O2 reduction and thermal oxidation of H2 to form water. In conclusion, adding glycerol to seawater and utilizing Pt/TiO2 granular photocatalysts should be able to achieve an extremely economical method for photocatalytic hydrogen production at sea without having to remove DO or procure pure water."
