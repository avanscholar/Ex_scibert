0,Introduction,"Natural gas and petroleum are the principal resources used to produce most chemicals. In addition, the production of chemicals is among the most energy-intensive segments of the industrial sector, accounting for the consumption of ∼5quadrillion Btu per year within the United States [1], most of which comes from fossil fuels. Growing concerns about climate change and diminishing fossil resources are driving the development of renewable and non-fossil-based feedstocks for the production of chemicals. Carbon dioxide has attracted considerable attention as a C1 building block for the production of chemicals and fuels [2–6]. With the advances in capture technologies, CO2 could become available at low cost and its conversion to value-added chemicals could be cost-competitive [3]. Furthermore, large-scale CO2 conversion could balance global CO2 emissions [7,8]. Presently the conversion of CO2 is limited to a few products including urea (146Mton/year [9]), methanol via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) then CO hydrogenation (5Mton/year [10]) and salicylic acid (170kton/year [6]). The most promising strategy for the large-scale conversion of CO2 is through hydrogenation processes, producing alcohols and hydrocarbons [3,11]. However, CO2 hydrogenation is quite challenging due to its stability, the lack of sufficiently active and selective catalytic materials, and the lack of cost-effective, non-fossil fuel sources of the hydrogen (e.g. via water splitting) [4]. This paper describes the development of novel catalytic materials for CO2 hydrogenation at low temperatures where products like CH3OH are preferred and in the liquid phase; it is noteworthy that there has been significant progress in water-splitting for H2 production [12]. Carbon dioxide hydrogenation is commonly performed over oxide (e.g. SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, and CeO2) supported metal catalysts at temperatures ranging from 220 to 320°C with gas phase reactants. The most active materials typically employ precious metals, which are expensive and often catalyze the formation of CO and CH4, relatively low value products. For example, Au/TiO2 [13] and Pt/CeO2 [14] are reported to selectively produce CO via the RWGS reaction; Ru/Al2O3 [15] and Ni/SiO2 [16] are active for CH4 production; and Pd/CeO2 [17] and Cu/ZnO [18] are active for CH3OH synthesis. Many of these systems are considered bifunctional with the metal sites facilitating the dissociation of H2 and the oxide supports primarily facilitating CO bond cleavage and accommodating surface intermediates [19,20]. Transition metal carbides (TMC) can exhibit catalytic properties that resemble those of precious metals [21] and are active for a number of reactions including CO hydrogenation [22], water–gas shift [23,24], and methane reforming [25]. Importantly, these materials are active for CO2 hydrogenation. Dubois et al. reported results for a series of TMC catalysts and showed that Mo2C and Fe3C were more active than WC and TaC at 220–280°C [26]. However, more than 60% of the CO2 was converted into CO and CH4. They also reported that the addition of Cu to the Mo2C and Fe3C catalysts led to enhancements in the CH3OH selectivities by more than 50%. Similar enhancements were described by Vidal et al. [27], using Cu or Au promoted TiC (001) to produce CH3OH from CO2 hydrogenation at 250–320°C. The Cu/TiC (001) material exhibited a CH3OH production rate that was an order of magnitude higher than that for the pure TiC (001) material. Xu et al. [28] described the use of Mo carbides, including α-MoC1− x (x <0.5) and β-MoC y (y ∼0.5), for CO2 hydrogenation at 300°C. They concluded that the reaction activity and selectivity were strong functions of the Mo/C ratio; however, CO and CH4 accounted for ∼70% of the products. Porosoff et al. [29] recently reported that a bulk Mo2C catalyst outperformed CeO2 supported Pt or Pd catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation, producing primarily CO (∼93% selectivity) at 300°C and 1atm. The addition of Co onto Mo2C resulted in a slight increase in the CO selectivity. Investigations of CO2 hydrogenation over TMC-based and other types of catalysts have most often been carried out at relatively high temperatures (250–300°C), where desirable products like CH3OH are not thermodynamically favored. Fan et al. [30] reported results for CO2 hydrogenation over Cu/ZnO and Cu/Cr2O3 catalysts at 200°C with 7.5bar of CO2, 22.5bar of H2 and ethanol as the solvent. This lower temperature not only enhanced the selectivities to CH3OH but decreased selectivities to CO (product of an endothermic reaction) [31]. The best-performing catalyst, Cu/ZnO, afforded a rate of 0.02μmolCO2 m−2 s−1 with selectivities to CH3OH, CO, and ethyl formate of 73%, 20% and 6%, respectively. The results suggested that ethyl formate was an intermediate for the production of CH3OH. Huff and Sanford [32] developed a cascade system incorporating homogeneous catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation through formic acid and formate intermediates, although incompatibility among the catalyst components inhibited overall performance. Yu and Tsang [33] reported the production of methyl formate from CO2 in liquid methanol over a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst. A rate of 0.05μmolCO2 m−2 s−1 was achieved with 79% selectivity to methyl formate (balance CO) at 150°C, 140bar CO2 and 20bar H2. They suggested that surface formate was a key intermediate. Inspired by these results, we recently explored the use of Mo2C supported Cu catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation at 135°C, with 10bar CO2 and 30bar H2 in 1,4-dioxane [34]. The addition of Cu onto Mo2C significantly enhanced the CH3OH TOF (2.0×10−4 s−1). Introducing ethanol reagent improved the CH3OH production (by ∼40%) as a consequence of enhanced formation of the formate intermediate. Research described in this paper extends our investigation of CO2 hydrogenation over nanostructured Mo2C supported metal catalysts in liquid solvents to include other metals and temperatures higher than 135°C. We also interrogated the reaction pathways by probing the systems with possible intermediates, including CO and CH3OH. The use of liquid solvents, as opposed to reactions in gas phase, can impact catalyst stability [35]. For example, Verhoef et al. [36] reported that MCM-41 supported heteropoly acid catalysts were susceptible to severe deactivation during liquid phase esterifications compared to carrying out these reactions in the gas phase. This deactivation was primarily due to the presence of water which enhanced the mobility of the heteropoly acid species and caused catalyst sintering [36]. Therefore, we also investigated stabilities of the M/Mo2C catalysts by comparing the surface and bulk, physical and chemical properties before and after reaction. The findings will enhance our understanding of Mo2C-supported metal catalysts for low temperature CO2 hydrogenation and provide a scientific basis for their rational design for other related applications."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The bulk Mo2C catalyst was prepared using a temperature programmed reaction (TPR) technique starting from an ammonium molybdate (AM) precursor, (NH4)6MO7O24·4H2O (Alfa Aesar). Approximately 1.3g of AM was sieved to 125–250μm and then loaded into a quartz tube reactor. The AM was treated in H2 flowing at 400mL/min for 70min, as the temperature was increased from 25 to 350°C and held at 350°C for 12h. The reaction gas was then switched to 15% CH4/H2 (400mL/min) while the temperature was increased to 590°C in 1.5h and maintained at 590°C for 2h; the reactor was then immediately quenched to room temperature. The Cu/Mo2C and Pd/Mo2C catalysts were prepared using a wet impregnation method described elsewhere [37]. Briefly, the freshly-synthesized Mo2C was transferred under 15% CH4/H2 gas into a beaker containing 70mL deaerated water (to avoid the oxidation of Mo2C) with target amounts of Cu(NO3)2 and Pd(NO3)2·4NH3 and allowed to interact for 20h to achieve the 5wt% nominal metal loading. Argon was continuously purged through the solutions during the wet impregnation process to deaerate and agitate the solution. This method enabled the metal precursor to directly interact with the native Mo2C surface (as opposed to a passivated material). A recently study by Wyvratt et al. reported that deposition of active metal onto the native Mo2C produced nanoscale metal domains that were better-dispersed than those deposited onto a passivated Mo2C surface, resulting in superior catalytic performance for the WGS reaction [38]. It has also been suggested by Schaidle et al. that Cu and Pd are deposited onto the Mo2C via electrostatic adsorption and both metals are reduced in-situ by the Mo2C support during the wet impregnation process [37]. The resulting catalyst slurry was dried at 110°C for 2h and reduced in flowing H2 (400mL/min) at 300°C for 4h to decompose the nitrate and produce the Cu or Pd domains. The Co/Mo2C and Fe/Mo2C catalysts were synthesized using the incipient wetness impregnation. The impregnation was performed using an aqueous solution containing target amount of Co(NO3)2 or Fe(NO3)3, on the Mo2C support with a pore volume of 0.13cm3/g (measured by N2 physisorption). The incipient wetness was applied because only small amounts of Co and Fe (<2wt%) could be deposited via electrostatic adsorption [37]. The freshly synthesized Mo2C was transferred under Argon to a water-tolerant, oxygen free glove box filled with N2 to avoid any bulk or surface oxidation of Mo2C. The resulting catalysts were dried in the glove box on a heating plate at 110°C for 2h and then transferred under Argon into a quartz reactor where they were reduced in flowing H2 (400mL/min) for 4h at 450°C to produce the Fe and Co domains."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Surface areas of the materials were determined from N2 physisorption based on the BET method using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 analyzer. The Horvath–Kawazoe method was used to determine the pore size distributions. All of the Mo2C-based catalysts were degassed (<5mmHg) at 350°C for 4h prior to the surface area measurements. The bulk crystalline structures were characterized using X-ray diffraction (Rigaku Miniflex 600) with 2θ ranging from 10° to 90° and a scan rate of 5°/min. Crystallite sizes were estimated via line broadening analysis using the Scherrer equation [39]. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for select catalysts was performed using FEI Nova Nanolab Dualbeam (FIB/SEM). To enhance the conductivity, the materials were gold sputter coated prior to imaging. Elemental analyses were carried out using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). All the materials were passivated in 1% O2/He for 5h before performing SEM in order to be loaded into the sample chamber without bulk oxidation. Metal compositions for the M/Mo2C catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP-OES) using a Varian 710-ES analyzer. The surface site densities for Mo2C-based catalysts were determined via CO chemisorption using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 system with a thermal conductivity detector. The Mo2C-based catalysts were passivated in order to be loaded into the reactor chamber equipped with the AutoChem II 2920 system. Prior to the measurements, the catalysts were recarburized in 15% CH4/H2 for 4h at 590°C, then degassed in He at 600°C for 1h. The catalysts were then cooled to 25°C and repeatedly dosed with 5% CO/He (5mL sample loop) until reaching saturation. Deconvolution of contributions from the metal and Mo2C is desired; however, it is difficult because CO can adsorb to both the metal and Mo2C. Nevertheless, as Mo2C accounts for 95wt% of the catalyst, the CO chemisorption uptakes should provide reasonable estimates of site densities. The catalyst surface coverage was estimated by assuming 1019 active sites/m2 for the Mo2C support [24]. The H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was also carried out using the Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 system. The passivated M/Mo2C catalysts were first purged with He with a flow rate of 70mL/min at 200°C for 2h and then were cooled to room temperature. The H2-TPR was then conducted in 10% H2/Ar by increasing the temperature from room temperature to 800°C at a heating rate of 4°C/min, where the H2 consumption was recorded as a function of temperature."
4,Reaction rates and selectivities,"2.3 Reaction rates and selectivities The activity measurements were performed in a 50mL Parr Instrument reactor (Micro 5500). The reactor system was equipped with a programmable temperature controller and a magnetic drive for the impeller. The gas phase reactor effluent was analyzed using gas chromatography (Varian 450 with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors). Liquid samples (0.4mL) were periodically withdrawn during the reaction using a dip tube, which was equipped with a 20μm filter to separate the liquid from the solid catalyst particles. The liquid samples were analyzed offline using gas chromatography (Varian 450 with flame ionization detector). The Mo2C-based catalysts were used as synthesized without passivation. To avoid contact of the materials with air, they were transferred under an inert atmosphere and stored in an Ar filled glove box (Mbraun UNIlab, H2O<0.1ppm, O2 <5ppm). Solvents for the reactions contained 37.5mL 1,4-dioxane (anhydrous, Acros Organics) and 10μL n-decane (Acros Organics) as an internal standard. For the CO2 hydrogenation experiments, the reactors were charged with 10bar CO2 and 30bar H2 through a dip tube after purging the solvents with H2 for 15min to remove dissolved oxygen at temperatures of 135–200°C. Under these conditions, the solubilities for CO2 and H2 are approximately 1.5 and 0.14mol/L at 135°C and 1.0 and 0.18mol/L [40,41] at 200°C, respectively, in 1,4-dioxane. The CO2 reaction rates were calculated based on formation rates for the products (on a C1 basis) after 2h. Carbon balances closed to within ±8% for the experiments. The turnover frequency (TOF) was determined by normalizing the rate by the CO uptakes. The selectivity is defined as the molar ratio of a specific product over the total products on a C1 basis. For select catalysts, CO hydrogenation and CH3OH hydrogenation were performed at 200°C to investigate the reaction pathways. For CO hydrogenation the reactant was 10bar CO and 30bar H2 in 37.5mL 1,4-dioxane. The CH3OH hydrogenation experiments were performed using 7mmol (∼0.3mL) CH3OH, 10bar N2 (used as an inert gas to balance the pressure) and 30bar H2 in 37.2mL 1,4-dioxane. A catalyst loading of 200mg was used for each experiment unless stated otherwise. The reactor was heated at a rate of 5°C/min from room temperature to the target reaction temperature, and then agitated at a constant rate of 300rpm, which indicated the start of the reaction. Several of the spent catalysts were recovered for characterization. To avoid contact with air, the materials were removed from the reactor (as catalyst slurry) in the Ar-filled glove box and dried in vacuum for 2h at room temperature in the glove box antechamber. The dried catalysts were collected and stored in the glove box before they were characterized. Similar weights were measured for the recovered catalysts, suggesting minimal catalyst loss during the reaction."
5,Results,
6,Pre-reaction catalyst properties,"3.1 Pre-reaction catalyst properties The metal contents, surface areas, site densities, and corresponding theoretical surface coverages for all of the catalysts are listed in Table 1 . Metal contents for each of the M/Mo2C catalysts were ∼5wt%, the target loading. The deposition of metals onto Mo2C caused a slight decrease in the surface areas, possibly due to pore blocking by the metal particles. Pore size distributions for the M/Mo2C and bulk Mo2C materials suggested that the metal particles primarily blocked micropores in the Mo2C support (Fig. S1). Site densities for the M/Mo2C materials were lower than those for the bulk Mo2C (∼1.6moleculesCO/nm2) with the Pd/Mo2C catalyst possessing the highest site density and lowest nominal surface coverage owing perhaps to the high atomic mass of Pd. For comparison, site densities for Cu [42], Pd [43,44], Co [45,46], and Fe [47,48] have been reported to be 4.9, 6.6, 7.4, and 12.1moleculesCO/nm2, respectively. The lower site densities for the M/Mo2C catalysts suggest that metal–Mo2C interactions suppressed CO adsorption on Mo2C. Similar reductions in CO adsorption capacities have been reported for a Pt/Mo2C catalyst prepared using methods similar to those described in our paper [37]. X-ray diffraction patterns for the catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . The Mo2C support contained a mixture of α-MoC1− x (x ∼0.5) and β-Mo2C in approximately equal amounts (quantified by Whole Pattern Fitting Rietveld Refinement) and there was no evidence of Mo oxides. This finding indicated a complete carburization of Mo oxide precursor during the synthesis process. Given the Mo:C ratio for the material, we will refer to the Mo carbide as “Mo2C”. Diffraction patterns for the M/Mo2C catalysts resembled that for the bulk Mo2C with no discernable peaks for the supported metals. This observation was likely due to the fact that the most significant peaks associated with the metals overlapped with the Mo2C peaks (Fig. S2). For example, the Cu (111) peak at ∼43° and Pd (111) peak at ∼40° are located near the most intense peaks for α-MoC1− x and β-Mo2C, respectively. Weak peaks for the metals in the XRD pattern could also be a consequence of the small crystallite dimensions; the detection limit is approximately 5nm."
7,CO2 hydrogenation,"3.2 CO2 hydrogenation The CO2 hydrogenation reaction rates and selectivities for the Mo2C and M/Mo2C catalysts are summarized in Table 2 . At 135°C, CH3OH was the major product with selectivities in excess of 79%, while CO and CH4 were produced in small quantities. The deposited metals moderately enhanced the CO2 conversion rates and CH3OH selectivities. Very small but measurable amounts of C2H6 and C3H8 were observed for the Co/Mo2C and Fe/Mo2C catalysts. When the temperature was increased to 200°C, the CO2 conversion rate increased by more than an order of magnitude. We also observed a significant shift in product distributions with C1–C4 hydrocarbons produced over all of the catalysts. There was also a concomitant decrease in the selectivity to CH3OH on increasing the temperature to 200°C (50–70%) compared to that at 135°C (80–95%). This reduction in selectivity was anticipated as CH3OH synthesis is a highly exothermic reaction (ΔH 25°C =−49.5kJ/mol). Fig. 2 compares TOFs for alcohol formation over the M/Mo2C catalysts at 135 and 200°C. The CH3OH TOFs at 135°C decreased in the following order: Pd/Mo2C≈Cu/Mo2C>Fe/Mo2C>Co/Mo2C>Mo2C; the similar trend was also observed for CO2 hydrogenation at 200°C (Fig. 2). In addition to CH3OH, C2H5OH was produced at 200°C. Interestingly, when taken together, the CH3OH and C2H5OH TOFs for all of the M/Mo2C catalysts were similar (26–30×10−4 s−1). A potential pathway to C2H5OH and roles of the metals will be discussed in later sections. Fig. 3 compares TOFs for CO and hydrocarbon formation at 135 and 200°C. At 135°C, the addition of Cu or Pd to Mo2C had very small effects on the CO and hydrocarbon formation rates, while the addition of Fe and Co resulted in a decrease in CO formation and increase in hydrocarbon formation; mostly CH4 and small amounts of C2H6 and C3H8. Similarly, at 200°C, Cu and Pd had very small effects on the production of CO and hydrocarbon compared to that for bulk Mo2C catalyst, suggesting these metals were not active for the production of hydrocarbons. In contrast, the deposition of Fe and Co onto Mo2C significantly enhanced the production of C2–C4 hydrocarbons, while decreasing the selectivity to CO. The hydrocarbons were primarily paraffins, with an olefin/paraffin ratio of 0.08–0.35 (see Fig. S3). Such low olefin/paraffin ratios have also been reported for other Mo2C-based materials [26,49]; this observation is also consistent with the high hydrogenation activities associated with Mo2C. Addition of the metal did not significantly affect the olefin/paraffin ratios."
8,Reaction pathway investigation,"3.3 Reaction pathway investigation There are multiple pathways to the products described in the last section. The CO2 hydrogenation products could be the result of CO produced via the RWGS reaction. Mo2C catalysts have been reported to be highly active for RWGS [50]. Alcohols and hydrocarbons could be produced from CO. Alternately the alcohols and hydrocarbons may have been produced directly from CO2. Apparent activation energies for individual products often provide useful insights regarding the reaction pathways. We also used CO and CH3OH as the reactants to interrogate the reaction pathways. Based on the activities and selectivities presented in Section 3.2, we selected the Cu/Mo2C (selective for CH3OH) and Fe/Mo2C (selective for C2–C4 hydrocarbon) catalysts for the reaction pathway investigations. Arrhenius plots for the formation of CH3OH and hydrocarbons for the Cu/Mo2C and Fe/Mo2C catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 4 . The experiments were performed at each temperature using new catalysts (all from the same synthesis batch). The corresponding apparent activation energies, E a,App, are listed in Table 3 . Activation energies for hydrocarbon formation were very different and much higher than those for CH3OH formation. This suggested that the rate determining steps involved different intermediates and perhaps different active sites. In comparing E a,App values for Mo2C with those for the supported metal catalysts, we noted a slight reduction consistent with the metal facilitating conversion. These trends are consistent with our previous findings that Cu facilitates methanol production while Fe enhances hydrocarbon formation over Mo2C surface. 3.3.1 CO hydrogenation The hydrogenation of CO was performed at 200°C using 10bar CO, 30bar H2 over Cu/Mo2C and Fe/Mo2C catalysts. The product formation TOFs are shown in Fig. 5 . For both the Cu/Mo2C and Fe/Mo2C catalysts, CH3OH and C2H5OH were observed. The CH3OH produced during CO hydrogenation was only 7.7% and 3.2% of that produced during CO2 hydrogenation over these catalysts, respectively. This result suggested that most of the CH3OH produced during CO2 hydrogenation was directly from CO2. The hydrocarbon formation TOFs from CO were 3–4 times higher than those from CO2 hydrogenation, perhaps due to a higher CO concentration (by about a factor of 4) compared to the CO2 concentration. Interestingly, when normalized by the CO concentrations, the hydrocarbon formation rates were comparable (within ±12%) for CO and CO2 hydrogenation, again suggesting that the hydrocarbons were primarily produced via CO hydrogenation. In addition, the dominant product was CO2 for both catalysts, suggesting the significance of WGS at these conditions. We will compare the chain propagation properties in Section 4. 3.3.2 CH3OH hydrogenation The CH3OH hydrogenation experiments were performed at 200°C with 7mmol of CH3OH, 30bar H2, and 10barN2 over the Cu/Mo2C and Fe/Mo2C catalysts. The only detectable product was CH4 (see Fig. S4 in the SI), a consequence of CH3OH hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) as shown in Eq. (1). (1) CH 3 OH + H 2 → CH 4 + H 2 O, Δ G 200 ° C = - 106 kJ / mol Early transition metal carbides including Mo2C are known to be highly active HDO catalysts [51]. Although CH3OH HDO is thermodynamically favorable, it is an undesirable side reaction, as CH4 and H2O are less valuable than CH3OH and H2. The normalized CH3OH consumption rate only accounted for 3–5% of CH3OH produced during CO2 hydrogenation, suggesting that only a small portion of the CH3OH was lost via HDO. The Cu/Mo2C was twice as active as the Fe/Mo2C catalyst (Fig. S4) for CH3OH HDO with Cu being more effective in producing CH4. The results also indicated that CH3OH was not an intermediate for the production of C2–C4 hydrocarbons. The amount of CH4 produced from CH3OH HDO was negligible (0.7–1%) compared to the total CH4 formation during the CO2 hydrogenation. Neither CO nor CO2 were observed, indicating that methanol steam reforming (MSR) was insignificant under the conditions employed. This was not unexpected given the high H2 and low H2O concentrations used in our experiments; note that anhydrous 1,4-dioxane (the solvent used in our experiments) can contain up to ∼100ppm water."
9,Post-reaction catalyst properties,"3.4 Post-reaction catalyst properties To evaluate the stabilities of M/Mo2C catalysts, several physical and surface properties were characterized before (pre-reaction) and after (post-reaction) use for CO2 hydrogenation. Again, the Cu/Mo2C and Fe/Mo2C catalysts were characterized. There were negligible differences in the surface areas and metal contents before and after reaction (Table 4 ). Diffraction patterns for the pre- and post-reaction Cu/Mo2C and Fe/Mo2C catalysts (Fig. S7) were similar although the post-reaction Cu/Mo2C catalyst exhibited a slightly sharper peak at 43°, corresponding to Cu (111). This result suggested a small degree of sintering for the Cu/Mo2C catalyst. Nevertheless, the results indicated the robustness of the Cu/Mo2C and Fe/Mo2C catalysts. Micrographs of the passivated, pre- and post-reaction Cu/Mo2C and Fe/Mo2C catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 6 . For the pre-reaction Cu/Mo2C catalyst (Fig. 6a), Cu was dispersed unevenly over the Mo2C surface with particle sizes ranging from 30 to 500nm. For the post-reaction Cu/Mo2C catalyst, slightly larger Cu particles were observed ranging from 50 to 750nm. This result confirmed some degree of sintering for the Cu particles during CO2 hydrogenation at 200°C. In contrast, the Fe/Mo2C catalyst contained relatively large patches of Fe (3–10μm). These patches are likely the cause for the decrease in the surface area by ∼20% (Table 1). There was no significant change in the surface morphology when comparing the pre- and post-reaction Fe/Mo2C catalysts. Interestingly, although Fe or Cu particle sizes observed in the micrographs were substantially larger than the XRD detection limit (∼5nm), no discernable metal peaks were observed in the diffraction patterns. A plausible explanation is that Fe is part of either γ-Fe or Fe2O3, where their most significant peaks overlap with the major peaks of Mo2C at ∼41° and 37° respectively, making phase deconvolution difficult (Fig. S2); Cu (111) overlapped with α-MoC1− x at 43° as shown in Fig. 1. The large particles could also be agglomerates of small metal crystallites that were below the XRD detection limit. It has been reported that during the FTS, the active phase for the Fe-based catalyst is an iron carbide [52–54]. No obvious iron carbides were observed from the XRD, although one of the major Fe2C peaks also overlaps with the Mo2C peak at 43° (Fig. S2). From the EDX data (see Fig. S6), the carbon and iron were not co-located suggesting that Fe2C was not present. Interestingly, oxygen and iron were co-located, which implicated the presence of Fe2O3 at least at the surface for the passivated materials. The H2-TPR profiles for passivated pre- and post-reaction Cu/Mo2C and Fe/Mo2C catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 . The bulk Mo2C catalyst produced two major peaks: one at low temperature ∼210°C that we attributed to reduction of the passivation layer [55], and a high temperature peak at ∼700°C which corresponded to decomposition of the Mo2C, as observed previously [23]. The addition of Cu and Fe caused a shift in the lower temperature peak from 210°C to 170 and 140°C, respectively. A similar shift has been reported for Pt/Mo2C catalysts prepared using methods similar to those described in this paper [56]. This was likely due to H2 activation over the supported metal; subsequently this hydrogen could be used to reduce the passivated Mo2C [57,58]. The presence of the supported metals did not appear to affect decomposition of the Mo2C (∼700°C). Similar H2-TPR profiles were observed for the pre- and post-reaction catalysts, indicating that exposure to the reactants and solvent during the reaction did not alter surface chemistries of the M/Mo2C catalysts. We also characterized the post-reaction catalysts by rerunning the CO2 hydrogenation experiments. These experiments also provided an assessment of the recyclabilities of the catalysts. The results for the Cu/Mo2C and Fe/Mo2C catalysts are shown in Fig. 8 . The slight decrease in CH3OH production over the Cu/Mo2C catalyst was consistent with the Cu sintering observed by XRD and SEM. The Fe/Mo2C activity remained fairly constant on re-use."
10,Discussion,"Results presented in this paper allow us to understand the effects of the metal type and temperature on the performance of Mo2C supported metal catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation, and the potential reaction pathways for these catalysts. There are limited reports regarding CO2 hydrogenation over Mo2C-based catalysts, and other than our prior work [34], the experiments were carried out with gas phase reactants. Table 5 compares results from our work with those in the literature that are at similar temperatures. The CO2 conversion TOFs measured during the liquid phase experiments were slightly lower than those for the gas phase. According to Bussche and Froment [59], the rate for the gas phase CO2 hydrogenation was first order with respect to both CO2 and H2. If the liquid phase reactions also followed the same rate law, the trend in CO2 conversion TOFs could be a consequence of the relatively lower CO2 and H2 gas concentrations in the liquid phase compared to that in the gas phase. The concentrations for CO2 and H2 were 1.0 [41] and 0.18mol/L [40] respectively in 1,4-dioxane and 0.3, 0.8mol/L in the gas phase at 200°C, 10bar CO2, and 30bar H2. We also observed that CO and CH4 were the predominant products for CO2 hydrogenation in the gas phase, while alcohols including C2H5OH and C2+ hydrocarbons were the predominant products for our work in the liquid phase. This difference in selectivity was likely due to the different reactant densities in the liquid and gas phase media. Different synthesis and pretreatment protocols could also contribute to the differences. Recall that we directly employed freshly-synthesized Mo2C catalyst without surface passivation. Xu et al. [28] and Dubois et al. [26] described a pretreatment of the passivated Mo2C via recarburization or H2 reduction prior to the reaction. This could introduce different types or distributions of the active sites over the Mo2C surface and ultimately alter the product selectivities. Results presented in this paper are consistent with different active sites for the formation of alcohols and hydrocarbons. Recall that activation energies obtained for methanol (60–76kJ/mol) and hydrocarbons (96–110kJ/mol) were different (Table 3), implying different rate determining steps and perhaps different pathways. Xu et al. [28] indicated that selectivities during CO2 hydrogenation were highly dependent on the Mo/C ratio and crystalline phases present. They reported that β-Mo2C catalyst was more active than α-MoC1− x but produced primarily CO and CH4, while α-MoC1− x catalyst was more selective to CH3OH. Porosoff et al. [29] also reported that a β-Mo2C catalyst exhibited high selectivities to CO albeit at atmospheric pressure. Recall that the Mo2C used in the current study was a mixture of α-MoC1− x and β-Mo2C; therefore, it is plausible that α-MoC1− x produced primarily CH3OH, and β-Mo2C produced primarily CO (via RWGS) and perhaps C1–C4 hydrocarbons via FTS. The supported metals likely influenced the properties of sites already on the Mo2C surface; it is also possible that the metals introduced new sites. Previously we reported experimental and computational results suggesting that, for Pt/Mo2C catalysts, highly active sites for WGS were located at the interface between the Pt and Mo2C [24]. These sites were much more active than those associated solely with Mo2C or Pt. Results presented in this current paper do not allow us to determine whether there were active sites for CO2 hydrogenation at the interface between the metal and Mo2C; however, the presence of the supported metal clearly contributed to the catalytic properties. The addition of Cu and Pd resulted in a significant increase in the CO2 conversion rates and selectivities to CH3OH at 135 and 200°C (Table 2). Copper [31,60,61] and Pd [62–64] are known to be selective for CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH, and their addition to Mo2C would be expected to improve the CH3OH selectivity. Copper and Pd have also been reported to function synergistically with metal oxides (e.g. ZrO2 and ZnO) by facilitating H2 dissociation, which makes atomic H available to the support (likely via H2 spillover) for CO2 hydrogenation [65,66]. The possibility of synergy between Cu and Mo2C is currently being explored. While Cu and Pd affected CH3OH selectivities, the Co/Mo2C and Fe/Mo2C catalysts yielded significant amounts of C2+ hydrocarbons and ethanol. Weatherbee and Bartholomew [67] reported that oxide supported Co and Fe facilitate the formation of C2+ products during CO2 hydrogenation and suggested that the hydrocarbons were produced via CO hydrogenation. Our results are consistent with this finding, in particular that CO is likely a primary intermediate for hydrocarbons over the Mo2C catalyst. We postulate that Mo2C produces CO via the RWGS and CO hydrogenation occurs on both the Fe or Co particles [68–70] and the Mo2C surface. Previously, it has been reported that CO adsorption site densities for the pure metals decreased in the following order: Fe>Co>Pd>Cu [42–48]. The higher CO hydrogenation activities for the supported Fe and Co catalysts may be a consequence of their higher CO surface coverages for these metals compared to those for the other metals. Ethanol may have been produced via a CO-insertion or oxygenate-based mechanism [49]. Fig. 9 summarizes what we understand about the reaction pathways for CO2 hydrogenation over Mo2C supported metal catalysts under the experimental conditions employed for our research. Similarities between the hydrocarbon formation rates and distributions for CO hydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation are consistent with CO being a common intermediate. A useful way to compare the hydrocarbon distributions is via Anderson–Schulz–Flory chain propagation probabilities (α). These α values were determined using the Anderson–Schulz–Flory equation (Eq. (2)): (2) W n / n = ( 1 - α ) 2 · α n - 1 where Wn is the weight fraction of hydrocarbons containing n carbon atoms and α is the chain propagation probability, i.e. the probability that a molecule continues reacting to form a longer chain. The α value is obtained by taking the linear slope of log(Wn /n) and n (the ASF plots can be found in Fig. S5). The α values for CO and CO2 hydrogenation are identical (see Table 6 ). Also note that α values for the Fe/Mo2C and Co/Mo2C catalysts were higher than those for other catalysts for both CO2 and CO hydrogenation. These results are consistent with literature indicating that Fe and Co are effective for chain propagation during FTS [68,71], while Cu or Pd produces surface intermediates that lead to C1 products, i.e. CH4 and CH3OH [18,63,72]. While CH3OH was an additional source of CH4, the contribution was insignificant such that the α values were not affected. Three mechanisms have been suggested for the formation of C2+ products during CO hydrogenation [73,74]: the carbide, oxygenate, and CO insertion mechanisms. Recently, a mechanistic study performed by Schaidle and Thompson [75] implicated that the chain growth over Mo2C-based catalysts was primarily via the oxygenate mechanism. This mechanism involved the molecular adsorption of CO and subsequent hydrogenation to produce surface methoxy species (CHO); CC coupling then occurred via condensation of the CHO species and hydrogenation steps. This pathway produces alcohols as the side products during the chain growth to form hydrocarbons, which was consistent with ethanol formation at 200°C for our study. Iron-based catalysts have also been reported to perform chain propagation via the oxygenate mechanism [54]. In fact, Mo2C-based catalysts are known to dissociatively and associatively adsorb CO, with the latter being responsible for chain propagation [75]. Given our results, we believe the addition of Fe introduced additional associative adsorption sites over Mo2C, which likely modified Mo2C and resulted in an enhancement in C2+ hydrocarbon formation. Two pathways have been suggested for CH3OH production; one involving surface formate and formaldehyde species and the other involving CO as the major intermediate [76–78]. In comparing the CH3OH production rates during CO and CO2 hydrogenation, we found that CO contributed insignificantly (3–7%) to the total CH3OH production, implicating surface formates and aldehydes as principal intermediates. Interestingly, neither formic acid nor aldehyde were detected during the reaction. We believe that these species were rapidly converted, given the thermodynamic favorability (Table S1)."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, a series of Mo2C-supported metal catalysts were evaluated for CO2 hydrogenation at 135–200°C in 1,4-dioxane solvent. At 135°C, the catalyst favored CH3OH with selectivities up to 95%, while at 200°C, the selectivity shifted to C2H5OH (∼15%) and C2–C4 (5–10%) hydrocarbons with a reduced selectivity to CH3OH formation (50–70%). A comparison of the product distributions over the M/Mo2C catalysts revealed that the addition of Cu and Pd enhanced CH3OH synthesis, while the deposition of Co and Fe enhanced CC coupling to produce C2–C4 hydrocarbons and ethanol. Our analysis of the reaction pathway suggested that CO was the intermediate for hydrocarbon production via FTS, while CO2 was the primary source for CH3OH likely via surface formate/aldehyde intermediates. The M/Mo2C catalysts were robust and experienced minimal changes in catalytic activity and physical/surface properties as a consequence of use for CO2 hydrogenation. The results also suggested that Mo2C possessed distinct sites for the production of alcohols and hydrocarbons. The activities of these sites can be altered by, for example, depositing metals or changing the synthesis/treatment protocols. The findings from this study advance our understanding of the low temperature CO2 hydrogenation activities of carbide supported metal catalysts and provide insights for the design of these types of materials for other reactions."
