0,Introduction,"The catalytic performance for a range of important industrial processes strongly depends on the metal particle size, such as for Co and Fe catalysts in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [1–3], Pd and Pt for various hydrogenation and oxidation reactions [4,5], and Ag for ethylene epoxidation [6]. Supported Cu catalysts are widely used in industry for methanol synthesis, methane steam reforming, the water-gas shift reaction and numerous oxidation reactions [7]. In the methanol synthesis reaction, a weak but significant particle size effect has been reported [8]. However, the role of the Cu particle size is still not fully understood. This partly originates from the difficulty to control the Cu particle sizes below 10 nm. Additionally, the complexity of many reactions may hamper studies on the correlation between catalyst structure and performance. For example, the methanol synthesis reaction proceeds via a combination of concurrent CO hydrogenation, CO2 hydrogenation and (reverse) water gas shift reactions. To rationally design optimization strategies for Cu-based catalysts in general, it is crucial to understand how the activity, selectivity and stability are affected by varying Cu particle sizes. The hydrogenation of short chain alkyl esters is a promising model reaction for catalyst studies, since the mechanism is relatively simple and well understood [9–11]. The industrial hydrogenation of esters is commonly performed using Cu-based catalysts. Cu provides distinct advantages over other active hydrogenation metals, e.g. Pd, Pt, Ru, Rh and Ni, in the fact that Cu is less expensive, abundantly available and exhibits superior selectivity towards unsaturated CO ester bonds, leaving CC bonds intact [12]. Moreover, various alkyl acetates can be efficiently produced via synthesis gas. Considering that synthesis gas can be produced from natural gas, coal or renewable biomass and solid municipal waste stream, the conversion of alkyl acetates presents a potential key step to develop more renewable routes towards essential alcohols [13–16]. The hydrogenation of ethyl acetate (EtOAc) is a particularly promising model reaction to investigate the Cu particle size effects, due to the characteristic high selectivity towards ethanol (~95%) [10,14,17,18]. The establishment of structure-performance relationships is facilitated by using well-defined model catalysts, using moderate metal loadings (<20 wt%) and relatively inert support materials [19,20]. To effectively use the metal atoms, a nanometer-sized metal phase is typically desired for catalysis. Interestingly, the catalyst activity is often influenced by the size and structure of metal particles below ~20 nm [21]. In the crucial size regime between 2 and 10 nm, the various surface facets exhibit a steeply changing fraction of different adsorption sites, such as edges, corners, steps and kinks, with lower metal-metal coordination saturation than terrace sites at flat surfaces [1,22]. Studies on particle size effects for other hydrogenation metals, such as Fe and Co in Fischer Tropsch synthesis [2,3], Ni and Co in CO to methane hydrogenation [21,23], Pd, Pt, Au and Ag for various hydrogenation and oxidation reactions [24–26], demonstrated that the intrinsic activity per surface site was correlated to the size-dependent surface structure of the specific metal nanoparticles [1,8,21,24]. As mentioned above, the Cu-based activity in methanol synthesis from CO and CO2 depends on the Cu particle size below 10 nm [8]. However, the chemical reactivity does not only depend on the metal size, but also on the chemical nature of the reactant [21,27,28]. An ester bond consists of σ CO and π CO bonds, and is different from the π bonds in CO or CO2. Interestingly, the hydrogenation of the acyl reaction intermediates was reported as the rate-determining step in alkyl ester hydrogenation [10,14,29], which resembles formate hydrogenation as the rate-determining step in the methanol synthesis reaction [30,31]. Unraveling the origin of the Cu particle size effects in the hydrogenation of EtOAc may hence be relevant for a range of Cu-catalyzed reactions. In addition, there is a debate on the role of the Cu oxidation state. The presence of Cu+ species was reported to enhance the catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of alkyl acetate [14,18,32], and di-esters [33,34]. It was hypothesized that a combination of dissociative H2 adsorption on Cu0 sites and polarization of the CO ester bond on Cu+ sites enhanced the catalytic activity [14,18,32,35]. Alternatively, the catalytic activity was reported to scale proportionally with the metallic Cu surface area, in the hydrogenation of dimethyl maleate [36] and dimethyl oxalate [35]. The effects of oxidation state for Cu-based catalysts, and how these scale with Cu particle size, are hence still unclear, and will be taken into account in this study. We prepared a series of supported Cu catalysts with Cu particle sizes tuned between 3 and 14 nm, and studied whether the hydrogenation of EtOAc was sensitive to the Cu particle size. Additionally, the influence of the initial Cu particle size, poly-dispersity and interparticle distance on the particle growth was evaluated. High surface area graphite was used as the catalyst support, to minimize the metal–support interaction and reveal the intrinsic Cu particle size effects [37]."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Cu/C catalyst preparation,"2.1 Cu/C catalyst preparation A series of carbon-supported Cu (Cu/C) catalysts was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using 2.0–3.3 M aqueous Cu(NO3)2 solutions, followed by drying and thermal treatment to decompose the Cu precursor. The Cu particle size was controlled by a combination of synthesis approaches, including variation of the Cu loading (6–16 wt%) and final heat treatment temperature (250–400 °C), as well as functionalization of the carbon support (liquid phase surface-oxidation using concentrated HNO3 oxidation for 110 min at 80 °C). High surface area graphite was used as the carbon support (HSAG–500, kindly provided by Timcal Ltd.). The BET specific surface area was approximately 500 m2 g−1, with a total pore volume of 0.7 mL g−1 and a density of acidic surface groups of 0.16 nm−2. The oxidized graphite support had a surface area of approximately 440 m2 g−1, a total pore volume of 0.62 mL g−1 and a density of acidic surface groups of 0.64 nm−2. Further details about the synthesis procedures are described in Section S1 of the Supporting Information. As an example of a typical synthesis procedure, a Cu/C catalyst containing 16.4 wt% Cu was prepared by impregnating ~2 g of a powdered carbon support to incipient wetness, in a three-necked round-bottom flask. An aqueous solution of 5.0 M Cu(NO3)2 in 0.1 M HNO3 (pH ~1) was added drop-wise via a syringe through a septum, while stirring under vacuum. The impregnate was stirred for 24 h to advance the uniform distribution of the metal precursor throughout the support. Subsequently, the sample was dried overnight at room temperature, while stirring under dynamic vacuum. The dried sample was transferred to an Ar-filled glovebox and loaded into a tubular flow reactor. Next, the sample was heated with 0.5 °C min−1 to 230 °C with 1 h hold with 230 °C under a flow of 5 vol% H2/N2 flow (~100 mL min−1 g−1; GSHV ~4000 h−1), resulting in decomposition of the nitrate precursor and formation of Cu nanoparticles. Finally, the catalyst was passivated by exposing it overnight to air at room temperature. The final Cu weight loading was calculated as C u w t % = m a s s C u m a s s C u O + m a s s s u p p o r t ∗ 100 % . The Cu/C catalysts in this study were denoted as X_Cu/Y, in which X represents the surface-averaged Cu particle size in nm, as determined by TEM, and Y indicates the type of carbon support material."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization TEM and XRD were used as characterization techniques to determine the Cu particle and crystallite sizes and estimate the geometric Cu surface area. Herein, the particles were assumed to be spherical and fully accessible. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on an FEI Tecnai 20 microscope, operated at 200 kV. Samples were prepared by dispersing the dry catalyst powder onto a Ni sample grid, coated with holey carbon (Agar 300 mesh Ni). The Cu particle size was measured for at least 200 individual particles. The number-averaged Cu particle size (d n, also referred to as d [1,0]) and surface-averaged Cu particle size (d s, also referred to as d [3,2]), including the standard deviation in the particle size distribution (σ), were calculated using the formulas d n ± σ d n = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N d i ± 1 N ∑ i = 1 N d n - d i 2 and d s ± σ d s = ∑ i = 1 N d i 3 ∑ i = 1 N d i 2 ± 1 N ∑ i = 1 N d s - d i 2 , in which d i indicates the diameter of the i th particle and N stands for the total number of measured particles. Methods for calculating the interparticle distance are discussed in Section S1. X-ray diffractometry was performed on a Bruker D8 powder X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Co-K α1,2 radiation source (λ = 1.79026 Å) and a Lynxeye detector. Diffractograms were taken directly after the final step in the synthesis under reductive atmosphere, or after an additional reduction treatment (1 h at 250 °C in 20 vol% H2/N2, ~100 mL min−1 g−1), without exposure to air. The reduced catalyst was loaded into an airtight XRD specimen holder (A100B33, Bruker AXS) inside an Ar-filled glovebox (Mbraun LABmaster, <0.1 ppm H2O, <0.1 ppm O2). Diffractograms were continuously acquired with 0.1 °2θ increment between 5 and 95 °2θ, in approximately 2–3 h. The diffractograms were normalized to the peak intensity of the graphitic (0 0 2) diffraction peak at 30.9 °2θ and carbon baseline subtracted. The Cu0 crystallite size was determined by applying the Scherrer equation to the main Cu0 (2 0 0) diffraction peak at (59.3 °2θ), with a shape factor k of 0.1 [38]. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles were measured on a Micromeritics Autochem II ASAP 2920 apparatus, with H2 consumption detected by a thermal conductivity detector. Prior to the measurement, the passivated catalysts were dried at 120 °C for 30 min under Ar flow (~1 mL min−1 mgcat −1) and left to cool down to 50 °C. Next, the reduction profiles were determined by heating the catalyst with 2 °C min−1 to 400 °C, in a flow of 5 vol% H2/Ar (~1 mL min−1 mgcat −1). The reduction profiles were base-line corrected and normalized to the amount of Cu. The onset temperature was estimated from the intercept of the slope at the first inflection point of the peak with the baseline."
4,Catalytic performance,"2.3 Catalytic performance Catalytic experiments were performed on a high-throughput fixed-bed reactor system, equipped with 16 parallel channels (Flowrence®, Avantium N. V.). The catalysts were pelletized (2 cm diameter) using a hydraulic press at 1.5 ton weight, equivalent to 460 bar pressure, ground and sieved to obtain a granulate size of 75–150 μm. All experiments were done using ~6.0 mg of Cu mass per reactor. The required amount of catalyst (30–100 mg) was calculated from the Cu weight loading. The Cu/C catalysts were physically diluted with SiC granulates (212–425 μm). The SiC diluent was pre-treated by washing with HNO3(aq) (68%; 10 mL gSiC −1) and calcining at 800 °C, to remove any metal or organic contaminants. The volume of the diluted catalyst bed was kept constant at 0.3 mL. The catalyst was loaded into a stainless-steel reactor tube (2.6 mm inner diameter) on top of SiC granules (0.5 mL), which were pre-loaded onto a stainless-steel frit. A hollow glass wool fibre was placed on top of the catalyst bed, up to the entrance of the reactor, to ensure constant vaporization of the liquid reactant. The Cu/C catalysts were re-reduced in situ by heating to 200 °C (2 °C min−1) with 2 h hold at 200 °C, under a flow of 20% H2/Ar (2 mL min−1 per reactor). Subsequently, the temperature was lowered to 140 °C and the reactor was purged for 2 h using a mixture of H2:He in a 10:1 M ratio (6.2 mL min−1 per reactor). Next, the EtOAc feed was introduced in the gas phase (0.6 mL min−1 per reactor). The reaction mixture consisted of H2:He:EtOAc in a 10:1:1 M ratio (6.8 mL min−1 total flow per reactor). The GHSV based on the packing density of the diluted catalyst and the total gas flow per reactor was approximately 1350 h−1, and the WHSV was around 325 gEtOAC gCu −1h−1. Next, the pressure was gradually increased during 75 min to 30 bar(g). Finally, the temperature was increased to 180 °C with 2 °C min−1 to start the catalytic experiment. Between isothermal stages, the temperature was increased with 1 °C min−1. After the reaction, the catalysts were left to cool down to 90 °C and passivated by exposure to air at this temperature. The Cu-normalized time yield (CTY, molEtOAc gCu −1h−1) was used to calculate the turn-over frequency (TOF, molEtOAc molsurface Cu s−1) using the formula: CTY*M Cu/D Cu, in which M Cu stands for the molecular weight of Cu and D Cu the fraction of surface Cu atoms. The value of D cu is calculated from the Cu d s, assuming fully accessible and spherical particles using the formula 6*(V Cu A Cu −1)/d s. Herein, A Cu is the molar area occupied by surface Cu atoms (4.10*1022 nm2) and V Cu is the molar volume occupied by bulk Cu atoms (7.09*1021 nm3). D Cu is thus calculated as 1.04/d s, with d s in nm [39]. The initial TOF at 180 °C was determined after around 30 h on stream, and calculated from the Cu d s of the fresh Cu/C catalyst. The final TOF at 180 °C was calculated after around 150 h on steam, and calculated from the Cu d s after catalysis. To be concise, the initial reaction times will be referred to as 30 and 50 h on stream, yet precise reaction times may vary ± 2.5 h depending on moment of GC sampling. The E a and A values in the Arrhenius model were obtained from the slope of a linear fit line through the ln(r) values and the intercept with the y-axis, respectively. Herein, the rate r was either defined as CTY (mmolEtOH gCu −1h−1) or surface-normalized CTY (mmolEtOH mCu −2h−1) at conversions of ethyl acetate < 25%. In the Arrhenius model, the CTY at 180 °C was determined from the final isothermal stage, to minimize the influence of initial activation during the first 30 h on stream. Further details on method for catalyst testing are described in Section S2 of the Supporting Information."
5,Results & discussion,
6,Tuning the Cu particle size,"3.1 Tuning the Cu particle size A series of carbon-supported Cu (Cu/C) catalysts was prepared, using incipient wetness impregnation of a graphite support, followed by drying and thermal treatment to decompose the Cu(NO3)2 precursor. Two methods to tune the Cu particle size were applied. First, variation of the Cu loading between 6 and 12 wt% led to control over the Cu particle size between 8 and 14 nm, using a pristine carbon support. In the second approach, liquid phase HNO3 oxidation of the carbon support was employed to efficiently introduce oxygen-containing surface groups [37]. Using the oxidized carbon support and varying the final heat treatment temperature between 250 and 400 °C, allowed us to control the Cu particle size between 3 and 7 nm. Powder X-ray diffractometry confirmed the particle size analysis by TEM for all Cu/C catalysts. Combining these synthesis approaches allowed use to tune the Cu particle size between 3 and 14 nm. The Cu/C catalysts in this study were denoted as X_Cu/Y, in which X shows the surface-averaged Cu particle size in nm and Y indicates the type of carbon material. The physicochemical properties for the full series of Cu/C catalysts were summarized in Table 1 . To assess the influence of the support functionalization on catalyst stability, we prepared three Cu/C catalysts with the same Cu particle size, but using different Cu loadings (6.3 or 16.4 wt%) and/or support materials (pristine or oxidized carbon). The first sample was prepared using 6.3 wt% Cu and pristine carbon as the support. After heating to 230 °C in 20 vol% H2/N2, Cu particles of 8.6 nm were obtained (8.6_Cu/PC; Fig. 1 a). The second sample was prepared using the same Cu loading (6.3%), but using oxidized carbon as the support. In general, oxidizing the carbon support leads to smaller particles. To obtain the same Cu particle size of around 8 nm, the second sample had to be heated to 400 °C in a flow of 5 vol% H2/N2, which resulted in Cu particles of 7.3 nm (7.3_Cu/OC; Fig. 1b). The third sample was prepared using a higher Cu loading (16.4%) on the oxidized carbon support. This sample was heated to only 230 °C, yielding 8.0 nm Cu particles (8.0_Cu/OC; Fig. 1c). The Cu particle size was ~8 nm for the three different Cu/C catalysts, with similar particle size distributions (Fig. 1d) and poly-dispersity indexes (PDI) or around 33–34% (Table 1). However, the estimated interparticle distance (d Cu–Cu) was significantly higher for the Cu/C catalysts with the lowest Cu loading, for example 38 nm for the 8.6_Cu/PC catalyst with 6.3 wt% Cu, compared to 16 nm for the 8.0_Cu/OC catalyst with 16.1 wt% Cu. XRD studies on the reduced Cu/C catalysts (Fig. 1e), showed similar Cu0 crystallite sizes between 6.0 and 7.3 nm. The Cu/C catalyst with 16.4 wt% Cu exhibited the most intense Cu0 (2 0 0) diffraction peak, which was expected since it contains the highest Cu loading. These examples illustrate how we can control the Cu particle size by tuning the synthesis parameters, and allowed us to assess the influence of the carbon pre-treatment and interparticle distance on stability during catalysis."
7,Impact of Cu particle size on catalyst performance,"3.2 Impact of Cu particle size on catalyst performance Fig. 2 shows the EtOAc conversion and Cu-normalized time yield (CTY) for several representative Cu/C catalysts at 180–210 °C. The CTY after 30 and 150 h on stream are presented in Table S1 for all 12 Cu/C catalysts. In all cases, the conversion increased during the first 30 h on stream (Fig. 2a). Initial changes in activity are common for Cu-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions are generally believed to be caused by catalyst restructuring [40–42]. The surface restructuring may result in either activation or deactivation, depending on the specific reaction conditions, such as temperature gas atmosphere and catalyst pre-treatment. The 11.7 nm Cu/C catalyst did not show significant particle growth over the course of the experiment, and therefore the initial increase in conversion was not ascribed to Cu particle growth, yet rather to Cu surface restructuring and equilibration of the surface adsorbate composition. Catalyst stability was evaluated by comparing the conversions after 30 and 150 h on stream, both at 180 °C. Only minor changes in conversion were observed during catalysis. Overall, the highest conversion was observed for Cu particles of around 6 nm (Table S1). Remarkably, the selectivity towards ethanol (SEtOH) was > 99.5% for all Cu/C catalysts, with ethane and acetaldehyde as the main by-products. It was significantly higher than reported values in literature for supported Cu-based catalysts, which are typically ~95% in the same temperature and conversion range [10,14,17,18]. The superior selectivities for the Cu/C catalysts are ascribed to the chemically inert nature of the carbon support [37,43]. Adsorption/desorption studies of ethyl acetate on carbon materials have been reported in literature and a fairly strong interaction has been found [44–46]. However, the experiments in literature used predominantly microporous carbon materials and lower temperatures than those relevant for catalysis. The surface coverage of ethyl acetate on carbon under catalysis reaction conditions is hence likely low. If a bifunctional mechanism would play an important role, the specific interface between the Cu nanoparticles and the support becomes an important parameter, and it is expected that smaller metal particles will give more active catalysts, while we find the opposite for our catalysts. Hence, it is unlikely that the carbon support plays an important role in catalysis. Two reference measurements using either the bare pristine or bare oxidized carbon supports showed no ethyl acetate conversion at 210 °C, thus excluding hydrogenation activity on the bare carbon supports, supporting that the hydrogenation of ethyl acetate only occurs on the Cu particle surface. Next, we assessed the Cu particle growth during catalysis. Particle growth is known to be a main deactivation mechanism for Cu-based catalysts, and can be affected by the Cu particle size, the poly-dispersity in particle size distribution, the interparticle distance, and hence the Cu loading [47–51]. Here, we discern the influence of two main mechanisms for particles growth, i.e. particle diffusion followed by coalescence, and Ostwald ripening, as schematically depicted in Fig. 3 a. We compared the Cu particle size for the fresh and used Cu/C catalysts after 150 h on stream (Fig. 3b). No significant influence of the carbon support surface-oxidation treatment was observed. However, the smallest Cu particles grew consistently more than the larger Cu particles. For example, the 3.1 nm particles grew to 7.0 nm after 150 h catalysis, while the 13.4 nm particles did not significantly grow. The faster growth of the smallest Cu particles is possibly due to the typically shorter interparticle distances for the smallest Cu particles, e.g. 7 nm for 3.1_Cu/C and 51 nm for 13.4_Cu/C (Table 1). The stability for the three Cu/C catalysts with particle size ~8 nm (7.3_Cu/OC, 8.0_Cu/OC and 8.6_Cu/PC) was compared (Section S2). Of these catalysts, the interparticle distance was the largest for the 8.6_Cu/PC catalyst, which also showed the most stable conversion over time and least particle growth. The poly-dispersity index increased with increasing particle size, e.g. 29% for 3.1_Cu/OC and 46% for 13.4_Cu/PC (Table 1). Considering the fact that the largest particles with the largest poly-dispersity were the most stable in size, Ostwald ripening was excluded as a main growth mechanism as it is strongly enhanced by high poly-dispersities [51]. Coalescence was therefore assumed to be the main pathway for particle growth, as it strongly depends on the interparticle distance [50,52]. The relationship between turn-over frequency (TOF) and Cu particle size is displayed in Fig. 4 . Both the initial and final Cu particle sizes were correlated to the activities after the 30 and 150 h on stream, respectively. Limited particle growth is expected during the initial activation period of 30 h at 180 °C, since particle growth is known to be accelerated at elevated temperatures. The good correlation between initial and final TOF values around the same Cu particle same validate our approach, and allow us to determine the TOF from 3 to 14 nm. The TOF increased around 4-fold for increasing Cu particle size from 3 to 10 nm, i.e. 0.6*10−3 s−1 for the 3 nm Cu particles, up to 2.0*10−3 s−1 for 10 nm Cu particles. For Cu particles above 10 nm, the TOF was size-independent. This is the first report on the Cu particle size effects for EtOAc hydrogenation, and it demonstrates that the reaction is sensitive to the Cu particle size below 10 nm. A similar 4-fold increase in activity with increasing Cu particle size below 10 nm was recently observed for the Cu-catalyzed methanol synthesis reaction [8]. Even though the EtOAc, CO and CO2 reactants are distinctly different in chemical nature, the proposed rate-determining steps are quite similar, i.e. hydrogenation of the acyl intermediate for EtOAc hydrogenation [30,31] and formate hydrogenation in methanol synthesis [14]. These similar trends suggest a common active site for both reactions. Interestingly, the Cu particle size effects are moderate compared to the ~10-fold increase in Fischer-Tropsch activity for increasing Co particle size from 2 to 6 nm [3], and ~10-fold increase in ammonia synthesis activity for Ru particles increasing from 1 to 6 nm [21,53]. For the Fischer Tropsch and ammonia synthesis reactions, the rate-determining steps are not surface hydrogenation reactions, but rather the dissociation of CO and N2, respectively. These findings show that the chemical reactivity does not only depend on the nature of the active site, but is also correlated to the nature of the intermediates for the rate-determining step [21]. The Cu/C catalysts were significantly more active than previously reported un-promoted Cu catalysts. For example, Lu and co-workers described TOF values of just 0.8*10−3 s−1 at 280 °C, for 13–23 nm Cu catalysts supported on SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 [17], while we measured TOF between 0.2 and 2.2*10−3 s−1 at 180 °C. The different synthesis methods may play a crucial role. The Cu catalysts on SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 were prepared using Na2SiO3 and Na2CO3 reagents [17], whilst it is known that Na+ may poison the Cu surface in hydrogenation reactions [54]. Another explanation for the higher TOF in this study may be the water content in the EtOAc reactant. Karl Fischer titration showed that the water concentration in our study was<50 ppm. The purity of the EtOAc feed can have a strong influence on the catalytic performance [47,55], and may explain the superior activity of the Cu/C catalysts under our experimental conditions."
8,Origin of Cu particle size effect,"3.3 Origin of Cu particle size effect In general, particle size effects may be caused by size-dependent changes in the electronic nature, metal-support interactions and the particle surface structure. All Cu/C catalyst contained Cu particles of 2 nm or larger, for which electronic support effects are expected to be negligible [24]. Moreover, carbon only weakly interacts with the Cu particles. Therefore, metal-support interaction is an unlikely origin of the observed particle size effects. We evaluated the catalyst reducibility, by H2 temperature-dependent reduction analysis on the passivated Cu/C catalysts (Fig. S3). All catalysts were completely reduced to Cu0/C at 200 °C under a flow of 5 vol% H2/Ar. The largest change in the reduction temperatures was observed for increasing Cu particle size from 3 to 5 nm. Above 5 nm, the reduction temperatures did not strongly change. Hence, it is unlikely that the reducibility explains the observed Cu particle size effect. Next, we examined the role of water. In our experiments, the formation of ethane (<0.5% product selectivity) coincided with water production (<100 ppm in the gas-phase). Based on calculations of simulated reaction conditions on bulk Cu, we expect an equilibrium in Cu/Cu+/Cu2+ oxidation states, with less than 1 in 105 Cu atoms being present as Cu+ or Cu2+ (see section S3 for details). Although the fraction is likely higher for nanoparticulate Cu, the results suggest that electronic effects are unlikely to explain the particle size dependence in catalytic activity. The apparent activation energy (E a) was calculated using the Arrhenius model (Fig. S4). In order to determine the E a, it is important to consider the reaction kinetics. From literature it is known that for a 10-fold excess of H2 over EtOAc, between 190 and 300 °C, the reaction orders with respect to both H2 and EtOAc were close to zero, indicating a saturated surface coverage [9–11,14]. Accordingly, a zeroth order dependency of the EtOAc concentration on the reaction rate was assumed. The E a was determined from rates (rather than rate constants) over the temperature range of 180–210 °C. We used the EtOAc conversion at the final stage at 180 °C (after 150 h) to minimize the influence of the catalyst activation behavior. The E a was calculated independently as a function of both the initial and final particle sizes (Fig. 5 a). The apparent E a ranged between 89 and 103 kJ mol−1, with an average value of 94 kJ mol−1. Fascinatingly, the E a for the Cu/C catalyst was hence found to be independent of the Cu particle size. Although the exact value of E a depends on specific reaction conditions such as temperature and pressure, the results for Cu/C are in good agreement with reported values of 74 kJ mol−1 for Cu/ZrO2 [29], 107 kJ mol−1 for Cu/SiO2 [11], 88 kJ mol−1 for Raney Cu [9] and 119 kJ mol−1 for macroscopic Cu [10]. This confirms that electronic effects scaling with size are not the cause of the Cu particle size effects, but rather due to an increase in relative abundance of the active sites with increasing size. We also calculated the pre-exponential factor (A), which can be correlated to the number of active sites for catalysis, assuming that their nature does not change with size (Fig. 5b). The value of A was derived from the Arrhenius model using the surface-normalized CTY, defined as mmolEtOH mCu −2h−1 and using an averaged E a of 94 kJ mol−1. An approximate 4-fold increase in A was observed for Cu particles between 3 and 10 nm (from 0.8*1010 to 3.2*1010), correlating to the 4-fold increase in TOF for the same particle size range. This indicates the presence of a well-defined and size-independent active Cu site responsible for EtOAc conversion, for which the abundance increased with increasing particle size up to around 10 nm."
9,Nature of the active site,"3.4 Nature of the active site To evaluate the nature of the catalytic site, we need to consider the Cu surface structure. The particle shape and surface structure of face centered cubic metal nanoparticles are known to be size-dependent [1,22,56]. To describe the complete surface nature of Cu particles up to 16 nm, we extrapolated the models by Van Hardeveld [22] and Van Helden [1] (details provided in Section S4). The Cu surface mainly consists of (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) facets with exposed terrace sites, but also exhibits different defects sites with lower coordination numbers such as corner, edge, step and kink sites. In general, the surface sites with the lowest coordination numbers exhibit the highest adsorption strengths [27]. The different surface sites therefore may have distinctly different chemical reactivities. We compared the size-dependence of the TOF with the abundance of each type of surface site. The fractions of corner and edge sites decreased with increasing Cu particle size above 2 nm, and were therefore excluded as the active site for the hydrogenation reaction. The corner and edge sites are likely too small to accommodate both dissociated hydrogen and the oxygenate intermediates [21,24,25,57]. The fractions of Cu (1 1 1) and Cu (1 1 0) terrace sites steeply increased with increasing Cu particle size up to around 6 nm, and are hence unlikely to strongly contribute to the catalytic activity. Interestingly, the fraction of step and kink sites gradually increases up to around 8–10 nm, thus closely matching the experimental TOF values (Fig. 6 ). The B5A step, B5B step and B6 kink sites can be found at the interface of different Cu (1 1 1) and Cu (1 0 0) planes, which represent the geometrical equivalent of higher Miller index Cu (3 1 1), Cu (2 2 1) and Cu (3 2 1) surfaces, respectively [1,22]. The differences between the theoretical fraction of step and kink sites and experimental TOF values may originate from structural deviations between the free-standing particle models and actual supported Cu particles under reaction conditions. The coordination saturation and adsorption strengths for the B5A and B5B step sites and B6 kink sites are reported to be similar to each other [1], hence it was not possible to unequivocally distinguish between the three sites. The adsorption strength likely has a strong influence on the hydrogenation activity. In line with Sabatier’s Principle, we propose that both the step and kink sites (with intermediate coordination saturation and adsorption strength) are responsible for the Cu-catalyzed hydrogenation of ethyl acetate. This is the first systematic study on the impact and origin of Cu particle size effects for the hydrogenation of EtOAc. Investigating the nature of the active site for the Cu-catalyzed hydrogenation reaction, was greatly facilitated here by using carbon as a support material. We showed that the relative abundance of step sites scales with both our measured pre-exponential factor in the Arrhenius model and TOF values, and therefore propose structure sensitivity as the origin of the observed Cu particle size-activity relationships. A maximum conversion was obtained with Cu particles of around 6 nm, which may guide the performance optimization of Cu-based catalysts for a plethora of hydrogenation reactions."
10,Conclusions,"The effects of Cu particle size between 3 and 14 nm were investigated for the Cu-based hydrogenation of ethyl acetate. High surface area graphite was used as an inert catalyst support, to investigate the intrinsic Cu particle size effects. The catalysts with Cu particles of 8 nm or larger were the most stable in this study. The TOF increased approximately 4-fold when increasing the Cu particle size from 3 to 10 nm, and became size-independent for particles above 10 nm. The apparent activation energy was independent of the Cu particle size, suggesting that the nature of the active site did not change with Cu particle size. However, the pre-exponential factor in the Arrhenius model suggested that relative abundance of the active site increased with Cu particle size up to 10 nm, which was ascribed to a size-dependent increase in the fraction of step and kink surface sites. A maximal yield was obtained with Cu particles of around 6 nm, giving an optimal balance between intrinsic activity and available surface area as a function of Cu particle size."
