0,Introduction,"The excessive use of fossil-derived fuels resulting in an increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere which originates the elevation of ‘greenhouse effect’. Currently, CO2 concentration in atmospher has reached 412 ppm which is about increased to 47 % since the onset of industrial age [1]. The extreme increment of CO2 in atmosphere has posed a pressing issue and challenges across the globe to curtail CO2 emission. Contrary, CO2 has been explored as a potent feedstock for production several versatile chemicals like formic acid (FA), methanol, urea, dimethyl ether (DME), hydrocarbons and carbonates etc. [2]. Different pathways such as catalytic, photocatalytic, thermochemical, biochemical, and electrochemical were reported widely for conversion of CO2 into chemicals [3,4]. However, the thermal stability of CO2 resulted in lower conversion rates into the most viable C1 products via direct, hydrothermal and chemical conversion [5,6]. The catalytic reduction of CO2 in the presence of H2 seems to be a most promising option for production of chemicals as well as H2 storage but thermodynamic stability of CO2 remains a major barrier for ease of CO2 reduction [7]. However the integration of catalysts can play crucial role to activate the CO2 as well as H2 to favour reaction equilibrium towards reduction products. Thus, the development of an efficient catalyst is a major dispute to disrupt the thermodynamics constraints of CO2. Production of FA and methanol from CO2 has gained interest due to their industrial importance as a key raw material to several chemical processes [8]. FA has multiple industrial applications such as pharmaceuticals, textiles, tanning, agriculture, and food, etc. Currently, FA has been produced via carbonylation of methanol followed by hydrolysis but the requirement of toxic key raw material such as CO and expensive catalysts [9]. Nowadays, the direct hydrogenation of CO2 into FA has gained attention due to easy availability as well as reutilisation of CO2 with ease of H2 storage [10]. A broad range of catalysts including homogeneous, heterogeneous, photo, and electrochemical methods were adapted for CO2 to FA [11]. While the reported catalytic processes have supplementary disadvantages like a) use of precious Nobel metal-based catalyst (Pd, Au, and Pt), b) operated at high pressure (> 100 bar) of CO2 and H2, c) use of organic solvents (alcohols, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, ionic liquids, etc.) as reaction medium, d) longer reaction time (>120 h) and high temperature (> 220 ℃) and e) High operational cost. The economic feasibility of CO2 hydrogenation to FA was unclear and limited by the price of not only FA but also feedstocks and by-products of the process [12]. In order to develop an economic and sustainable catalytic process, requirement of an efficient catalyst is highly desirable in addition to the process intensification study [13]. Homogeneous noble metal based catalysts Ru, Rh, Ir, Fe and Pd etc. were extensively studied for CO2 reduction but there was some intrinsic limitations associated such as difficulty in separation, handling, reusability, and stability [14]. Thus, several heterogeneous catalyst have been explored under different operating conditions. Farlow and Adkins have firstly attempted production of amine/FA adducts by using Raney Ni catalyst under high pressure (20−40 MPa) at 80−150 ℃ in presence of ethanol/phenol system with TON < 1 [15]. Stalder et al. [16] have used Pd black catalyst to obtain TON 2.1 in presence of aq. NaHCO3 solution in 53 h. Takahaski et.al. [17] reported very low TON (0.022) by using Fe and Ni powder under the hydrothermal condition at 300℃. A two dimensional Bi catalyst was prepared by C. Xia and his co-workers and was used for continuous production of formic acid (current density, jHCOO − = 17.3 mA/cm2 at −0.79 V vs RHE) and other liquids fuels [18]. Moreover, chalcogenides based Cu electrocatalyst such as S doped Copper oxide (jHCOO- = −13.9 mA/cm2 at −0.9 V vs RHE) and CuSx with (jHCOO - =−9.0 mA/cm2 at −0.9 V vs RHE) [19,20]. Also, S derived - Pb based cathode (j HCOO − = −12 mA/cm2 at −1.08 V vs. RHE) used by James E. Pander et.al [21]. Pidko et al. [22] have reported supported Au nanoparticles on different supports such as Al2O3, TiO2, ZnO, CeO2, MgAl-HT (hydrotalcite), MgCr-HT and CuCr2O4 and found the best performance of Au/ Al2O3 with TON (215) in presence of NEt3 at 40 bar and 70 ℃ for 20 h. Su et al. [23] have reported Pd on carbon to obtain TON 527 h-1 using bicarbonates salts as CO2 source and H2 (0.69–5.52 MPa). The use of precious metal was restricted due to their availability and expensiveness. Thus, the researchers are directed towards easily available and non-expensive metal catalyst for CO2 reduction. Fachinetti et al. [24], have screened metal blacks of 8–11 group and encouraged the use of supported metal catalyst over bulk metal catalyst. Mainly, inexpensive and easily available first row transition metals such as Mn, Ni, Fe, Co, Cu etc. were more explored for FA production [25,26]. Of the first row transition metal catalyst, copper-based catalyst has attracted the much attention of researchers due to the feasibility of CO2 insertion [27]. Also, the mixed oxidation state of Cu [28], requirement of low overpotential, tuneable chemical and physical properties are the attractive features of Cu that makes it an ideal candidate for CO2 reduction [29]. This has initiated the usage of copper based heterogeneous catalyst for conversion of CO2 to chemicals. Cu (I) and Cu (II) salts such as Copper acetate has been used for hydrogenation of CO2 to formate with TON (167) in presence of base 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-undec7-ene (DBU) [30]. Cu based complex with 1,1′-bis (di-tert-butylphosphino) ferrocene ligand (i.e. [CuI(dtbpf)]) with TON (326−1.065*105) in presence of DBU base in 12−48 h of reaction time [31]. The nano Cu (II) oxide catalyst has also been used for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to FA with the highest Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production (61 %) [32]. Mixed Copper metal oxide such as commercial CuO/ZnO system especially known for conversion of CO2 to methanol. In order to enhance the activity and selectivity of product various promoters such as Zn, Zr, Si, Al, Ti, Cr, Ga, Ce etc. and catalyst support were explored [33]. Chiang et.at have reported CuCr2O4 for conversion of CO2 to FA with 14.6 % conversion and 12.8 % yield at 140 ℃ and 30 bar in 5 h [34]. Zhang et.al [35] have used TiO2 as promoter for the CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst to enhance the conversion of CO2 to about 4 % higher under 260 ℃ and 2.6 MPa (H2:CO2 = 3:1). Moreover, it was noted that TiO2 improves the adsorption capacity of hydrogen and also dissociate molecular H2 into H species efficiently over the catalyst surface. Arakawa et al. [36] have highlighted the importance of dispersing copper oxide over TiO2 as support as it accelerates the recuperation of Cu phase from its oxidised state to metallic state due to excellent hydrogen donating capacity of TiO2. Thus, the Cu based catalysts are mostly utilised for indirect production of FA, as FA is one of the by-product of CO2 hydrogenation. However, the reported process for the production of FA from CO2 has suffered from challenges and barriers such as a) use of expensive precious metal catalyst b) stringent operating condition c) low TON and d) use of additive/base in stoichiometric amount, etc. Thus, the strategy for the development of an efficient catalyst shall provide a new milestone in the field of CO2 to chemicals. As far as our knowledge, there are less reports available on exploring the Cu dispersed TiO2 catalyst for direct hydrothermal conversion of carbon dioxide. This has encouraged to work on CuOx-TiO2 for direct hydrogenation of CO2 to FA. The present manuscript introduced the use of Cu based catalysts for direct hydrogenation of CO2 into FA under hydrothermal condition by using moderate operating conditions (Scheme 1 ). Different Cu based catalysts were synthesized by using thesimple co-precipitation method and tested for hydrogenation of CO2. Of the tested catalysts, CuOx-TiO2 showed nanocrystalline surface morphology and found to be an efficient catalyst to obtain a high yield of FA. The physicochemical properties of the catalyst were studied by using surface analytical techniques such as ATR-FTIR (Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), XRD (X-Ray Diffraction analysis), SEM/EDS (Scanning Electron Microscopy & Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy), and BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area, etc. The yield of formic acid has been expressed in TON and reaction was monitored for analysis of FA concetration by HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography). Process intensification study for the influence of reaction temperature, time, the total pressure of CO2 and H2, catalyst concentration and Cu loading, etc. was conducted to obtain a high yield of FA. The plausible reaction mechanism of the hydrogenation has been discussed."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Copper nitrate trihydrate extra pure (98 %) and Titanium tetra isopropoxide (TTIP) extra pure (27.8–28.6 %) and TiO2 were obtained from Sisco Research Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. The ammonia solution about 25 % extra pure was procured from SDFCL (S.D. Fine-Chem. Ltd). The deionized water (DI) was used for catalyst preparation. Inorganic bases such as Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pellets purified (97.0 %), Potassium hydroxide (KOH) pellets of (>85 % purity), Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) of (>99.5 %purity) and Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) of (>99.7 % purity) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Organic base Trimethylamine (C6H15N), (99 % assay), and Dimethylamine (C2H7N) 40 % solution were purchased from SDFCL. The CO2 (>98 %) and H2 (98 %) gas cylinders were purchased from local suppliers. All the chemicals were used as such without further purification. All experiments were performed in triplicate and the final result was the mean of all three. The standard curve of FA was obtained by plotting the calibration curve with R2 = 0.999."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 The general process of direct hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid The CO2 hydrogenation reaction was conducted in a high-pressure autoclave reactor (100 mL, MOC Hastelloy) with a four-pitch bladed impeller. The autoclave reactor was charged with 50 mL water, 0.4 g of NaOH, and 0.1 g of catalyst, and then it was closed. The reactor was first purged with N2, then pressurized with 30 bar of H2 and 10 bar CO2. Then, the reactor was heated to desirable temperature i.e. 200 ℃ by using an external PID controlled electrical heater followed by continuous stirring at 300 rpm. The temperature was measured by using a thermocouple which was maintained within the range of +3℃. After completion of the reaction, the reactor was allowed to cool down at room temperature and then, depressurized into water scrubber. The reaction mixture was separated from the catalyst by vacuum filtration. The recovered catalyst was washed with DI water and dried in a vacuum oven at 80℃. The liquid sample was collected and used for final analysis by using Agilent 1200 series High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H (300 mm x 7.8 mm) ion exclusion column coupled with Refractive Index detector (G1362A). The concentration of FA was calculated by using a standard formula. The gaseous products after reaction were collected and tested by using GC with a PoraPack Q column with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). There was no other gas detected except CO2, H2 , and N2. 2.2.2 Catalyst preparation Cu dispersed TiO2 catalysts were prepared by a simple co-precipitation method. Solution A: About 7.2 mL TTIP was dissolved in 20 mL of ethanol and agitated for 15 min. Solution B: 0.03 g of copper nitrate trihydrate (CuNO3)2.3H2O) solution in ethanol. The solution B was added slowly to the solution A under vigorous stirring and maintained for 30 min. Then, (25 %) aqueous ammonia was added slowly to obtain pH 10 of the reaction mixture. The resulting suspension was stirred for 1 h at 30 ℃ and then heated to 60−65 ℃ for 3 h and agitated overnight at 30 °C. The resulting precipitate was filtered by using vacuum filtration assembly and washed with DI water until the pH of filtrate becomes neutral. The resulting filter cake was then dried in a vacuum oven at 60℃ for 24 h, and then it was calcined at 600 ℃ for 4 h. 2.2.3 Characterization of formic acid 2.2.3.1 The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) All the samples were tested for FA by using Agilent 1200 series High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H (300 mm x 7.8 mm) ion exclusion column coupled with Refractive index detector (G1362A). The mobile phase used was 5 mM H2SO4 in RO water as the eluent with a column temperature of 60 ℃ at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The liquid sample was first filtered through a syringe filter with a 0.2 μm PTFE filter paper. The concentration of formic acid was calculated using a standard formula."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Catalyst screening for direct CO2 hydrogenation,"3.1 Catalyst screening for direct CO2 hydrogenation The Cu and Zn based heterogeneous catalysts have been widely explored for CO2 reduction due to their better performance for CO2 reduction [37,38]. The use of metal oxide was reported for the enhanced catalytic activity of CO2 hydrogenation due to their increased dispersion property [39]. However, in the present study several Cu and Zn based metal oxide (CuZnZrO2, CuO-ZnO, and r-CuO-ZnO), ZrO2 supported metal oxide (CuZnZrO2) and TiO2 and CeO2 supported metal oxide catalysts (CuOx-TiO2, CuOx-CeO2 and ZnOx-TiO2) were synthesized and tested for CO2 reduction. The performance of the synthesized catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation was shown in Table 1 . The activity of the catalyst has been measured in terms of TOF, TON, and concentration of FA produced. In order to check the effect of catalysts, the blank reaction was conducted in the absence of catalyst which indicated the negligible formation of FA with TON (0.08) and TOF (0.02). Of the tested catalyst, CuOx-TiO2 calayst resulted in the highest yield of FA with high TOF (4.11) and TON (1.03). The strong affinity for selective products was reported for Cu dispersed TiO2 catalyst [40,41]. Similarly, in the present study higher selectivity was obtained for CuOx-TiO2catalyst. While in the case of metal oxides it was noted that the catalyst activity increased after reduction (r-CuO-ZnO) as compared to metal oxide. The activity of the catalyst was improved when it was dispersed uniformly over the support system. Also, the chemical and physical properties of the surface of support enhance the catalytic activity of the dispersed metal [42]. The Cu dispersed catalyst was tested to study the influence of support. The influence of catalyst support on TON and TOF was shown (Fig. 1 ). The use of SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZnO, and TiO2 has been widely studied as catalyst support for enhanced catalytic activity. Thus, in the present study Cu was dispersed on SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZnO, and TiO2 supports which were synthesized by using corresponding precursors such as, Tetrata ethyl orthosilicate, Aluminium isopropoxide, Zirconium oxychloride, Zinc chloride, and TTIP, respectively. It was noted that catalyst support remarkably affected the TON and TOF for CO2 hydrogenation. Of the tested catalyst acidic supports such as SiO2, Al2O3 and TiO2 provide higher TON and TOF as these supports usually possess high surface area with narrow pore configuration, and thus these are extensively explored as catalyst supports, adsorbents and having other ceramic applications [43]. The maximum value of TON (6.62) and TOF (1.65 h−1) was obtained for TiO2 and thus it was selected as catalyst support for further study. The efficient dispersion of Cu into the cage structure of TiO2 would provide the effective accessibility of active sites thus higher yield of FA acid was obtained in the case of TiO2 [44]."
6,Copper precursor loading,"3.2 Copper precursor loading The metal loading has a remarkable effect on the selectivity of products for CO2 reduction [45]. Optimum metal loading resulted in effective dispersion of metal on catalyst support while higher metal loading could contribute to leaching of metal from the surface [46]. However, in the present study to check the effect of metal loading on the yield of FA, the Cu precursor loading was altered from 0.1 to 1.6 wt % concerning TiO2. The influence of metal loading was shown (Fig. 2 ). The remarkable effect of Cu dispersing was observed, all the variant with different loading of Cu precursor showed formation of FA. But it was noted that there was no formation FA in absence of Cu dispersion. It was observed that the concentration of FA, TON, and TOF was increased with an increase in metal precursor loading up to 0.4 wt% and then decreased remarkably. The maximum TON and TOF were obtained at 0.4 wt%. It was noted that the height of the plane (101) at 2Θ 25.4 is highest in 0.4 wt% loaded CuOx-TiO2 catalyst (Fig. S1). This signifies that the crystallinity of 0.4 wt% loaded Cu on TiO2 has played an important role to obtain high TOF as compared to other variables. Zhong et al. [47] have reported that Cu content has a direct effect on the FA yield. Thus, the higher loading of metal could not contribute to effective dispersion of metal on the surface of catalyst support while an optimum loading Cu would contribute to homogeneous dispersion which resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. Thus, 0.4 wt % Cu metal-dispersed on TiO2 was chosen for further optimization."
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.3 Catalyst characterization A series of CuOx-TiO2catalysts were synthesized by the co-precipitation method followed by calcination at 600 °C and tested for hydrogenation of CO2 to FA. Of the tested catalysts 0.4 wt% Cu precursor dispersed TiO2 showed excellent catalytic activity and thus it was selected to study its physicochemical properties by using the following characterization techniques. 3.3.1 ATR-FTIR spectroscopy analysis To study the bonding of Cu on TiO2, ATR-FTIR (Shimadzu IR Prestige-21 Kyoto Japan instrument, coupled with the Specac Golden Gate GS10500 ATR assembly) analysis was performed. The ATR-FTIR spectra bare TiO2 and CuOx-TiO2 was shown (Fig. 3 ). It was observed that ATR-FTIR spectra did not show intense absorption peaks. The presence of peaks within the range of 538−514 cm-1which is the characteristics of M–O (Ti-O and Cu-O) vibrations. The absorption peak obtained below 1000 cm-1 is mainly associated with Cu-O and Ti-O stretching band [48,49]. The presence of weak absorption peaks at 3300 cm-1 to 3500 cm-1 corresponds to OH vibration due to traces of water [50]. 3.3.2 X-ray diffraction analysis The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted on Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometers at room temperature with Cu (Kα) radiation having an accelerating voltage up to 40KV with scintillation counter detector and angle ranges from 10°–120°. The overlay of the XRD pattern of CuOx-TiO2 and bare TiO2 was shown (Fig. 4 ). The XRD pattern of both CuOx-TiO2 and bare TiO2 depicted the presence of characteristics planes of anatase TiO2 (101), (103), (004), (112), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220) and (215) at corresponding 2Θ value 25.3°, 37.88°, 38.7°, 39°, 49°, 54°, 55.28°, 62.78°, 69°,71°,75°respectively (JCPDS No. 21-1272) [51]. There was no additional peak in CuOx-TiO2 indicating dispersion of Cu within TiO2 lattice as the crystal structure of Cu2+ and Ti4+(0.72 pm and 0.68 pm) [52]. The crystalline size of TiO2 and CuOx-TiO2 was calculated by using the Debye-Scherrer Eq. (1). (1) d ( n m ) = K λ β c o s θ where d is the crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of incident X-ray which is 0.154 nm; β is the FWHM (full width at half maximum) of diffraction peak; θ is the Bragg’s angle in radians and K is the Scherrer constant (0.9). The average crystalline size for CuOx-TiO2 was 17.9 nm while TiO2 was 15.9 nm. The FWHM valued calculated from the XRD pattern confirms the Nano-crystalline structure of the synthesized catalyst. The catalyst was calcined at 600℃ and thus, all peaks obtained were sharp and showed the crystalline nature of CuOx-TiO2. To check the influence of metal loading the XRD pattern of all CuOx-TiO2 loaded with variable metal precursor was studied. The overlay of XRD pattern of different CuOx-TiO2 loaded with variable metal precursor percentage on TiO2 was shown (Fig. S1), it clearly showed the presence of a small peak at 2Ɵ 27.5° which corresponds to Cu2O (111) in all XRD pattern except in that of 0.4 wt% CuOx-TiO2, and the intensity of this peak increases with increasing of Cu precursor loading, while the peak at 2Ɵ 25.4° corresponds to CuO (111) plane. Thus, the presence of only CuO peak in 0.4 wt% CuOx-TiO2 is responsible for its better catalytic effect with TiO2 support [53]. The obtained XRD pattern with different Cu loading on TiO2 is in good agreement with peak pattern as reported by Xi- jia Yang et al. [51]. Thus the Cu present in in the form of TiO2-CuOx mixture. 3.3.3 FEG-SEM & EDX analysis The surface analysis plays an important role to understand the catalytic reactions [54]. Especially, in heterogeneous catalysis, it provides an important insight of catalyst surface and surface morphology which enhances the catalyst activity. In the present study surface, morphological properties of CuOx-TiO2 catalysts were recognized by obtaining SEM images at different magnification. The FEG-SEM analysis coupled with EDX was conducted on the JEOL JSM-7600 F instrument. All the samples were subjected to analysis after sputtering with the Pt electrode. The SEM micrographs of TiO2 and CuOx-TiO2 at different magnification was shown (Fig. 5 ). SEM micrographs depicted the change in surface morphology of TiO2 after copper dispersion. The surface of TiO2 was found to be like an irregular granular structure with a hard surface. It was noted that the CuOx-TiO2 catalyst consists of an agglomerate of irregular granular shaped within the range of 49−75 nm. Simultaneously, samples were subjected to EDX to determine the elemental composition of elements. The EDX spectra of CuOx-TiO2 was shown (Fig. 6 ). The EDX spectra depicted the characteristic peaks of Cu at Kα value (0.9 keV, 8.0 keV, and 8.9 keV). Thus, the EDX results are in agreement with that of ATR-FTIR and XRD analysis which confirms the presence of copper dispersed over TiO2. Moreover, the quantitative percentage of elements obtained by EDX analysis shown a correlation with metal precursor loading (Table S2). In addition to EDX analysis, the actual weight of copper got dispersed on TiO2 has been confirmed by ICP-OES (Induced coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy) analysis by using The Agilent 5800 ICP-OES Instrument Dichroic Spectral Combiner (DSC) that enables synchronous radial and axial measurements. The ICP-OES of CuOx-TiO2has also depicted a correlation with actual metal precursor loading (Table S2). It was noted that both EDX and ICP-OES results are in good agreement with each other. 3.3.4 Specific surface area (SBET) analysis The catalyst surface area plays an important role to determine the catalytic activity, higher the catalyst surface area higher will be the catalyst activity [55]. The specific surface area analysis of the catalyst support TiO2 and CuOx-TiO2 was conducted by using nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis on TriStar II 3020 (Micromeritics, USA) instrument at liquid nitrogen temperature. The sample was initially degassed at 200 °C for 4 h. The surface area of the catalysts was calculated from the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm data, using Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) equation. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms for both bare TiO2 and CuOx-TiO2 were shown (Fig. 7 ). The BET specific surface area for bare TiO2 and CuOx-TiO2 was found to 76.82 m2/g and 67.26 m2/g, respectively. The CuOx-TiO2 catalyst showed agglomeration which may result in blocking of active sites thus decrease in surface of CuOx-TiO2 can be observed [56]. It was noted that the N2 adsorption-desorption pattern of bare TiO2 and CuOx-TiO2 depicted the presence of a hysteresis loop at P/Po 0.8−1.0. Thus, both bare TiO2 and catalyst CuOx-TiO2 show closeness to type-IV isotherm with the mesoporous surface as defined by IUPAC [57]. Thus, the presence of a mesoporous texture of catalyst contributes to effective adsorption of CO2 and H2 to form reactive intermediates and products. The pore size distribution plot showed non-uniform pores from 10 to 175 nm, but most of them are within under 50 nm scale (Fig. S2). Thus, it can be concluded that the particles belong to a multimodal porous system with mesoporous pore size distribution."
8,Process intensification studies,"To enhance the productivity and selectivity of products in the catalysis process, the study of the influence of reaction parameters plays an essential role. Thus, in the present study, the influence of reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, a reaction pressure of H2 and CO2, catalyst concentration, selection of base, concentration of the base, reaction temperature and pressure ratio of H2 and CO2 were studied to increase the TON, TOF, and yield of FA."
9,Influence of catalyst concentration,"4.1 Influence of catalyst concentration The incorporation of a catalyst increases the rate of reaction but there is no direct thumb rule to correlate the catalyst concertation and yield of the product. In the case of chemical reaction, higher and lower catalyst loading affects the productivity and selectivity of the desired product [58]. The remarkable effect of catalyst loading on CO2 reduction was studied [59,60]. In a few cases, increased catalyst loading increased yield of the product but this can’t apply to all catalytic systems [61]. However, in the present study to test the influence of catalyst loading, the reactions were conducted by varying the catalyst concentration ranges from 0.05 to 0.5 wt. % concerning the volume of reaction. The influence of catalyst concentration on TOF (h−1), TON, and yield (mg) of FA was shown (Fig. 8 ). It was observed that on increasing catalyst loading yield of FA and TOF increased up to 0.2 wt.% loading but on the further increase, a gradual decrease was observed up to 0.4 wt.% loading, and then a remarkable drop was noted. There was no remarkable effect on TOF for the catalyst loading 0.1 wt% to 0.4 wt.%. The maximum TON, TOF, and yield of FA were obtained at when 0.2 wt.% of CuOx-TiO2 catalyst loading. The drop in yield at higher loading can be observed due to the formation of particles agglomerates while at optimum loading the catalyst particles get dispersed effectively in the reaction mixture resulting in better contact of the substrate with active sites."
10,Influence of reaction temperature,"4.2 Influence of reaction temperature The reaction temperature is the most important factors to determine the rate of a chemical reaction and has a remarkable CO2 reduction [62]. To study the effect of reaction temperature on yield of FA, TON, and TOF, the reaction was conducted at temperature ranges from 110℃- 250 ℃ in presence of CuOx-TiO2 catalyst. The influence of reaction temperature on the yield of FA, TON, and TOF was shown (Fig. 9 ). The negligible formation of FA was noted at lower reaction temperature (110 ℃) while it increased significantly up to 200℃ and decreased beyond 200 ℃. Thus, the reaction temperature has remarkably affected the yield of FA. Wenjuan et.al [63] have reported that an increase in Gibbs free energy at temperature 323.15 K–623.15 K while it decreases gradually when the temperature was above 623.15 K. In addition to this, the reaction was thermodynamically unfavourable at a higher temperature and higher pressure. Similarly, in the present study drop in yield of FA was observed on increasing reaction temperature beyond 200℃ drop in yield of FA. In addition to this at a higher temperature, there is also the possibility of formic acid decomposition or reverse water gas shift reaction [47]. Thus, reaction temperature 200℃ was selected for further study."
11,Influence of reaction time,"4.3 Influence of reaction time The reaction time has a remarkable effect on the rate of product formation, an efficient heterogeneous catalyst necessitated shorter reaction time to activate the reaction selective products [64]. In the case of CO2 reduction, a remarkable effect of reaction time was reported for the decomposition of FA at prolonged reaction time [65]. To check the influence of reaction time, the reaction was conducted for 0.5–10 h with the calculation of TON, TOF, and yield of FA for the corresponding reaction. The effect of reaction time on the yield of FA, TON, and TOF was shown (Fig. 10 ). It was noted that on increasing reaction time yield of FA, TON and TOF increased and then decrease beyond 8 h. The negligible increment in yield of FA, TON, and TOF was noted for 0.5 h–1 h reaction time. Thus, the shorter reaction time could not be favourable. This is because during initial time gaseous substrates get adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst to form reactive intermediates. The maximum concentration of formic acid was achieved at 4 h but on further increase in reaction time, a significant drop in TON, TOF, and yield was observed. The longer reaction time could contribute to the decomposition of FA [65]. The maximum TOF value was obtained at 4 h reaction time thus, it was chosen as an optimum reaction time for further study."
12,Influence of reaction pressure,"4.4 Influence of reaction pressure The direct hydrogenation of CO2 with hydrogen to produce formic acid is a pressure dependant reaction both in terms of the total pressure of CO2 and H2 and their pressure ratio (PCO2: PH2) [66,67]. The composition of CO2 and H2 with their corresponding pressure remarkably affect the yield of FA. In the case of heterogeneous catalysis higher pressure promotes effective adsorption of CO2 and H2 on catalyst surface to shift the reaction towards FA. Thus, to check the effect of pressure in the presence of CuOx-TiO2 catalyst, the reaction was conducted with a variable PH2 /PCO2 ratio from 1 to 3 was shown (Fig. S3). The highest yield of FA was obtained at PH2 /PCO2 ratio 3 while on further increase in hydrogen gas pressure resulted in a drop in yield of FA. As the hydrogen was required by the catalyst for activation and to promote the reaction [68]. Thus, the PH2 /PCO2 ratio 3 was selected to study the influence of pressure. The influence of total pressure on the yield of FA, TON, and TOF was shown (Fig. 11 ). It was noted that the total pressure (PH2 + PCO2) has a remarkable effect on the yield of FA, TON, and TOF. The yield of FA, TON, and TOF increased remarkably with an increase in pressure up to 40 bar and the decreased notably. The significant drop in yield of FA was observed at higher pressure beyond 40 bar which may be due to the execution in saturation kinetics of reaction at higher pressure [69]. Thus, the optimum pressure 40 bar was selected to obtain the maximum yield of FA, TON, and TOF. The lower total pressure could result in weak interaction of gaseous substrates and catalyst active sites thus lower yield was observed at pressure < 40 bar. In the case of heterogeneous catalysis, the pressure of reactive gas can contribute to accelerating the reaction to speed up the adsorption and surface reaction step of the catalytic cycle [70]."
13,Influence of base and concentration of base,"4.5 Influence of base and concentration of base Direct hydrogenation of CO2 to FA is a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction as per reaction as below, CO2 (g) + H2 (g) → HCOOH (l) ΔG⸰ 298 = 32.9 kJ mol-1 To shift reaction towards formic acid high pressure (> 2 MPa) and additives such as amine, ammonia, or an alkali were explored to promote the formation of an adduct/complex which assists easy reduction of CO2 into FA [71]. Thus, the use of additives plays a crucial role to activate CO2 for catalytic reduction. The use of basic additive (amine or ammonia) stabilizes the intermediate (formate salts) and contributes to a drop in negative ΔG value (−35.4 kJ mol−1). While the use of an aqueous reaction medium contributes to decreasing ΔG (−4 kJ mol−1) [72]. Thus, in the present study reaction was conducted in water, in presence of organic bases; such as trimethylamine (TEA) and dimethylamine (DEA) and inorganic bases; such as KOH, NaOH, Na2CO3, and NaHCO3. The influence of base on the yield of FA, TON, and TOF was shown (Fig. 12 ). To check the influence of base, the blank reaction was conducted in absence of base and it was noted that the addition of base has a remarkable effect on FA yield, TON, and TOF. In absence of base very low yield of FA was observed at the lowest TOF (0.27) and TON (1.08). Of the tested bases it was noted that inorganic bases have better performed (TON > 3.6) than organic bases (TOF < 3.6) with high TON. This can be observed due to the possibility of the formation of the complex adduct of the corresponding base which leads to more side products that have been confirmed by the HPLC chromatogram was shown (Fig. S5) [73]. The highest TON (6.62) was observed for NaOH as it produces only formic acid as a selective product and there was no side product formation which was confirmed by HPLC. The NaOH as base additive was selected to study the effect of concentration base on the FA yield. Thus, the concentration of NaOH was varied from 0.1 to 1.6 wt. % concerning the volume of reaction (Fig. 13 ). It was observed that initially with an increase in the concentration of NaOH, the yield of FA, as well as TON and TOF, was increased but when its concentration was doubled, a sudden drop in TON and yield of FA was found. As, it was reported that the stabilization enthalpy for the rate of formation of FA was disturbed when the concentration of amine/formate salts adducts increased and could lead to FA dehydrogenation [73,74]. The plausible mechanism can be proposed via (a) activation (b) hydrogen dissociation (c) CO2 insertion (d) hydride attack (e) FA desorption (f) catalyst regeneration steps (Scheme 2 ). Nanocrystalline Cu located in the TiO2 cage structure can adsorbed hydrogen on its active surface are which can further be dissociated to form a reactive complex with CO2. During the surface reaction, a hydride attack can take place on CO2 to form FA adduct. The FA adduct can be desorbed from catalyst surface followed by regeneration of the catalyst. Thus, the cycle can be continued further to produce FA."
14,Reuse and recyclability of the catalyst,"4.6 Reuse and recyclability of the catalyst The recyclability of catalysts contributed crucially to the economic viability of the catalytic process [75]. In the present study, the recyclability test was performed under the intensified reaction parameters. The catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by vacuum filtration and reused for a further run. Catalyst recyclability test was conducted for five consecutive runs. The influence of recycled catalyst on TON and yield (mg) of FA was shown (Fig. 14 ). The gradual decrease in the yield of FA was observed after each run but a sudden drop in the FA concentration was observed after the fifth recycles run. This might be due to the inactivation of the catalyst due to the blockage of active sites after the 4th run. The deactivation of the catalyst was confirmed by the presence of extra peaks due to intact impurities on catalyst surface as observed in overlay ATR-FTIR spectra and XRD pattern of fresh, and regenerated catalyst (Figs. S5) and (S6). Also, the surface morphology of the recycled catalyst was changed, FEG-SEM of the fresh and recycled catalyst shown (Fig. S7). Thus, after the 5th run catalyst was calcined at 600℃ for 4 h to reboot the catalyst activity. The absence of extra peaks in ATR-FTIR, XRD spectra, and consistency in FEG-SEM images of regenerated catalyst confirmed the removal of intact impurities from catalyst surface after calcination. Also, the consistency in the performance of catalyst activity on the yield of FA was observed. The comparison of present CuOx-TiO2 system with prior art for direct CO2 hydrogenation showed several benefits in term of operating condition, use of non-expensive base and reaction medium etc.(Table S3)."
15,Conclusions,"The catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to chemicals and fuels has provided new horizons to cope with excessive carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. In the present study nanocrystalline Cu dispersed TiO2 as a heterogeneous catalyst was prepared by a simple co-precipitation process and explored for direct hydrogenation of CO2 to FA. The activity of the copper-based catalyst was found to be dependent on catalyst support and process operating parameters. The exploration of TiO2 for Cu dispersion was found as effective to obtain a higher yield of FA for direct hydrogenation of CO2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for the exploration of Cu dispersed TiO2 catalyst for direct CO2 reduction to FA. The highest TON (6.64) was obtained for 0.4 wt% CuOx-TiO2 in the presence of NaOH and under the intensified reaction condition. The process intensification study showed a significant impact of operating conditions to obtain a higher yield of FA as; a) The selection of copper dispersed catalyst played a significant role in direct CO2 reduction to FA. b) The catalyst concentration, reaction time, temperature, and total pressure has a remarkable effect to obtain a higher yield of FA. c) Incorporation of the base significantly improved the yield of FA more specifically inorganic base have a selective impact to obtain the desired product. d) The exploration of the CuOx-TiO2 catalyst provides a simple and non-complex alternative to utilize CO2 for the production of chemicals via direct hydrogenation. Thus, the present study provides a new horizon to explore supported Cu based transition metal catalyst for direct hydrogenation of CO2 into FA."
