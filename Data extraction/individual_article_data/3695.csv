0,Introduction,"Growing global population relies on modern agriculture and quick-acting fertilizers to satisfy mankind's huge food needs [1]. However, excessive use of synthetic fertilizers and large amounts of chemical leaching from fertilized soil have caused serious environmental problems worldwide [2–4]. For example, overuse of inorganic mineral fertilizers containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) has led to soil property deterioration (e.g., degradation of soil structure) and/or water contamination (e.g., eutrophication) in the estuaries and coastal regions due to their high mobility property [4–6]. One solution is to reduce fertilizer use, but this action affects crop yields. The reduction of fertilizer losses through the use of substrates that can control release and maintain moisture has been considered a promising alternative in recent years [4,7,8]. In this regard, slow-release fertilizers (SRFs) are designed to gradually release fertilizers for plant absorption to meet the plant's nutrient requirements, while reducing fertilizer losses [4,9,10]. The SRFs offer more advantages compared with conventional fertilizers, such as reducing environmental pollution, continuous fertilizer supply, and increasing fertilizer use efficiency by plants [2,11]. Meanwhile, water resources pose an important limiting factor for agricultural production; thus, novel nanomaterials capable of high-efficiency water management have attracted a lot of attention. In drought-prone regions, in particular, the combination of water-retaining characteristics and specific SRFs can help improve water and nutrient retention in sandy soils, enhance soil permeability and microbial activity, and reduce irrigation frequency and environmental pollution [1,12]. In recent years, hydrogels have been widely studied because of their abilities in controlling release of active components and improving water retention [13–15]. Because of their resistance to biofouling, biocompatibility and resource-rich properties, hydrogels prepared using biopolymers (e.g., cellulose, alginate, and other polysaccharides) have been widely investigated for bioengineering and agricultural purposes [13,16,17]. Among these, sodium alginate (SA), a linear polymer containing poly(guluronate) (G) and poly(mannuronate) (M) units in M-M, G-G, and M-G blocks, has been often utilized in many potential fields due to its gel-forming properties with divalent cations (e.g., Ba2+ and Ca2+) [10,13,18]. Alginate is also a pH-sensitive biopolymer with pendant carboxylic groups that accept and provide protons with changing pH values in aqueous solutions [15,18,19]. Moreover, studies have confirmed that alginate-based materials are excellent adsorbents and are commonly used to remove water contaminants such as metal ions, enzymes, and fertilizers in recent years [14,20–22]. However, cation exchange can lead to decomposition of the alginate-based hydrogel beads. For example, the exchange of calcium (Ca) ions with monovalent ions (such as sodium ions) can affect the crosslinking in alginates [13,23]. As a solution to this problem, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) has been employed in the formation of chemically or physically cross-linked hydrogels, taking advantage of PVA's large numbers of hydrophilic hydroxyl groups [23,24]. The outstanding properties of PVA, such as its simple production process, high chemical resistance, and biodegradability, make it ideal for agricultural and biomedical applications [25]. However, poor mechanical properties of PVA-SA hydrogels still hinder their wide-spread applications [26]. Incorporating clay, metal, carbon nanotubes and other micro/nano particles can help reinforce the mechanical properties of hydrogels [27,28]. Compared with inorganic materials, cellulose nanomaterials (CNMs) are sustainable and can offer better mechanical properties due to their high aspect ratio, large surface area, and potentially reactive surface [29,30]. As a major type of nanosized cellulose, cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) can help crosslink PVA-SA matrix to form stable gels [14,31], and the gels were reported to show higher mechanical strengths and storage moduli compared with pure polymers synthesized using irradiation techniques [32]. Previously, Yue et al. [14] demonstrated that SA/PVA-based hydrogels were significantly reinforced by CNFs, presenting higher (about three times) compressive strength than that of pure polymer hydrogels. In addition, CNFs with a high modulus of elasticity act as a mitigating agent for crack propagation, thereby inhibiting the destruction of hydrogels during stressing [33]. Currently, some published work [14,32–35] dealt with SA/CNF-based hydrogels. For example, Yue et al. [14] studied the Ca2+-crosslinked PVA/SA system, but the work did not involve the fertilizers' slow-release behavior from the hydrogels. Kumar et al. [36] only evaluated the influences of crosslinking functionality on cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) reinforced SA/PVA hybrid scaffolds. However, few studies have focused on the application of SA/CNFs-derived hydrogels in the presence of PVA cross-linked with Ca2+ for the controlled-release of NPK fertilizers. Therefore, the objectives of our study were (1) to develop novel composite hydrogels based on natural CNFs and SA with controlled fertilizer (i.e., N, P, K) release functionality and efficient water absorption properties, and (2) to investigate the morphology, chemical structure, water absorbency, and NPK-release behavior in water and soil of the hydrogels. The hydrogel system offers a promising fertilizer carrier with controlled release functionality for future agricultural and horticultural applications."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and sample preparation,"2.1 Materials and sample preparation Poly(vinyl alcohol) (M w 89,000; 99% hydrolyzed) and NPK fertilizer (potassium chloride, KCl, and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, NH4H2PO4) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Sodium alginate (Protanal® RF 6650 with M w ~ 270,000, G/M ratio = 2:1, and pH = 6.0–8.0) was purchased from the FMC Corp. (Philadelphia, PA, USA). Calcium sulfate (CaSO4) and Dulbecco's phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) and Invitrogen Corp. (Carlsbad, CA, USA), respectively. The original CNF suspension (2.0 wt%) was extracted from bamboo fibers. The suspension was first diluted to the 0.5 wt% concentration. The diluted material was processed using an M-110EH-30 Microfluidizer® (Microfluidics International Corp., Newton, MA, USA) at an operating pressure of 202 MPa for ten passes. The treatment with the microfluidizer helped breakup CNF bundles in the suspension, which improved CNF dispersion in water. Millipore deionized water from Millipore Milli-Q® system (>18 M Ω cm; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used to prepare the samples."
3,Preparation of SA-based hydrogel beads,"2.2 Preparation of SA-based hydrogel beads SA-based hydrogel beads were synthesized by crosslinking SA and CNF with a CaSO4 solution in the presence of PVA and NPK fertilizer (equivalent to 20 N, 20 P and 20 K) (Table S1). First, the 1.5% SA solution was added to the formed 0.5 wt% CNF suspension. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature until a homogeneous suspension was obtained. Second, 0.5% PVA solution was prepared by adding pure PVA powder slowly into deionized water and the mixture was then heated to 90 °C for 2 h using a magnetic stirrer hotplate (Corning Corp., Corning, NY, USA). The amount of deionized water lost during the heating process was measured after cooling, and additional water was added to the PVA solution to maintain its original concentration. The prepared 0.5% PVA solution and dissolved 1.5 wt% NPK solution were added to the prepared SA/CNF mixture with constant stirring. Third, the crosslinking method [11] was used to encapsulate NPK fertilizer within the hydrogels. After being stirred with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar at 500 rpm min−1 for 5 h, homogeneous SA/CNF/PVA/NPK suspensions were obtained. Each prepared homogeneous suspension was loaded in two plastic syringes, and a two-channel syringe pump (Chemyx Fusion 100T, Stafford, TX, USA) was used to push the suspension through two 20-gauge needles at a flow rate of 15 mL min−1 into a beaker containing 400 mL of 0.1 wt% CaSO4 solution. The CaSO4 solution was made into a homogeneous solution using deionized water and allowed to stand overnight before use. The vertical distance between the needle and the surface of the CaSO4 solution was approximately 20 cm. During this process, CaSO4 solution in the beaker was gently agitated mechanically to prevent mutual adhesion among the hydrogel beads. The terpolymer hydrogel beads formed were allowed to cure in the same CaSO4 solution for 12 h with stirring at room temperature. The hydrogels were then collected and washed three times with deionized water to remove residual Ca ions. The diameters of 20 hydrogel beads were measured using an optical microscope system (Carl Zeiss Axioskop 2, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) based on a previous protocol [37]. The wet hydrogel samples were rapidly frozen in a freezer at about −30 °C for 12 h, which were then transferred to a freeze-dryer (Free-Zone plus 2.5 L, Labconco, Kansas, MO, USA) at a temperature of −50 °C and freeze dried for 5 days. These fully freeze-dried hydrogels were further analyzed in the following experiments."
4,Hydrogel morphology characterization,"2.3 Hydrogel morphology characterization 2.3.1 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) The 0.1 wt% CNF suspension was prepared and sonicated for 1 h for the TEM study of fiber morphology. A droplet (5 μL) of the diluted CNF suspension (0.1 wt%) was deposited onto a 300-mesh Lacey carbon film grid (LC300-CU-100, Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK), which was negatively stained with a 2 wt% uranyl acetate solution for 2 min. The prepared samples were analyzed using a model JEM-1400 TEM (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at a 120 kV acceleration voltage. The average width of CNF samples was measured using the ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) from the collected TEM images following our previous protocol [30]. 2.3.2 Field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) Micro-structure and surface morphology of freeze-dried hydrogel samples were observed using a field emission SEM (FE-SEM, a Quanta™ 3D DualBeam™ FEG-FIB-SEM system, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at a 20 kV accelerating voltage. All samples were sputter-coated with gold for 2 min prior to the analysis. The average width of the randomly selected 50 beads was calculated from the obtained micrographs using the ImageJ software."
5,Structural characterization,"2.4 Structural characterization The chemical and crystalline structure traits of freeze-dried hydrogels were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) and wide-angle X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Prior to analysis, the hydrogel beads were ground using a McCrone Micronizing Mill (McCrone Group, Westmont, IL, USA) at room temperature. Then, these powder samples were placed into a Zn/Se-ATR crystal chamber of the Bruker Tensor-27 FT-IR analyzer (Bruker Optics Inc., Billerica, MA, USA). Each sample was scanned 32 times over the range from 4000 to 400 cm−1 with a resolution of approximately 2 cm−1 using the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode. The crystalline structure was analyzed employing a Siemens/Bruker D5000 XRD (Siemens Co., Wittelsbacherplatz, Munich, Germany) at an accelerating voltage of 45 kV and a current of 40 mA. Samples were scanned in the two theta (2θ) range from 5° to 65° in steps of 0.02°."
6,Water absorbency measurements,"2.5 Water absorbency measurements To study the effects of different physiological pH and salt solutions on the equilibrium swelling behavior of the hydrogels, we used the swelling ratio (SR) to measure their water absorption as described by previous protocols [11,38]. Typically, dried hydrogel samples of 0.20-g (W d ) were added to several solutions including 100 mL of deionized water, Dulbecco's PBS solutions (pH values: 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 and 3), 0.5 wt% saline solutions (NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2) and an alkali (0.5 wt% NaOH) solution, respectively, allowing them to reach swelling equilibrium. The swollen hydrogels were taken out of the solution using a stainless steel screen mesh at different time intervals (t, hour), and were weighed (W t, g). The swollen hydrogels were washed three times with deionized water and the excess surface solution was absorbed by clean and soft paper tissues. The specific sampling time intervals were 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 h after starting the test. Based on data from three independent replicates, SR (g/g) was calculated as: (1) SR = W t − W d W d where W d represents dry hydrogel weight (g), and W t represents wet hydrogel weight (g) at a given time t. To study the water-retaining behavior of hydrogels in soil, we also investigated the water retention (WR%) in the mixed soil (sandy soil: loam soil = 3:1; 25 mesh). Freeze-dried hydrogel samples (5 g) were thoroughly mixed with 50.0 g of dry mixed soil and the mixture was placed in a plastic container (15 cm in diameter). Subsequently, 100 mL of deionized water was added into the container. The weight of the prepared container was measured (W o, g). The container weight (W, g) without the dried-hydrogels was recorded as control, while the container weight (W t, g) at the target times within the 60-day test period was also recorded at room temperature. The WR (%) in mixed soil was calculated according to the previous protocol [11] as follows: (2) WR % = W t − W W o − W × 100 %"
7,NPK release measurements,"2.6 NPK release measurements 2.6.1 Slow-release behavior in water To understand the fertilizer release behavior of the hydrogels, we performed a slow-release experiment with NPK-based hydrogels at room temperature as described by Rashidzadeh and Olad [11]. Briefly, a freeze-dried hydrogel sample (1.0 g) was added to 100 mL of deionized water. For NPK determination, a 15-mL solution was sampled and placed in a test vial with plastic lid at specific time intervals (i.e., 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45 and 60 days). To keep a constant amount of solution, we added back an additional 15 mL of deionized water to the containers. Three independent experiments were conducted. All water samples for the release concentrations of N, P and K were analyzed. The concentrations of K and P were run on a Varian Vista-MPX™ ICP-OES analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), while the total N level was analyzed on a Shimadzu TOC/TN analyzer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The cumulative release (CR%) of NPK fertilizer was obtained: (3) CR = V E ∑ 1 n − 1 C i + V 0 C n m 0 × 100 % where V E is the sampling volume (mL), V 0 is the initial volume (mL), C i and C n are the released NPK concentrations (mg mL−1) at time i and n, respectively, and m 0 is the weight of NPK fertilizers (mg). 2.6.2 Slow-release behavior in soil For the investigation of the NPK release in soil, 1.0 g of freeze-dried hydrogels were thoroughly mixed with 100 g of mixed soil (sand: loam = 3:1; 25 mesh). The background values of total N, P and K of the mixed soil was 21.2, 52.3 and 38.4 mg kg−1, respectively. To separate the water sample from the mixture, a plastic container (500 mL) with a filter membrane, a valve and a lid was employed. The valve was closed when the mixture was filled into the container. Subsequently, 100 mL of deionized water was added to the soil container until it reached the soil-water saturation point. Throughout the study period, the water content in the container was kept approximately constant by adding deionized water (25 mL). At the same specific time interval as above, 15 mL of water samples were filtered by the filter membrane and then collected from the container by opening the valve. The levels of N, P and K in water samples were measured by the ICP-OES and TOC/TN analyzer, respectively. The background concentration of N, P and K in the mixed soil was also analyzed using the same protocols. Throughout the study, the detection of N, P and K in water and soil were conducted in the Wetland Biogeochemistry Analytical Services Center at Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, United States."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Synthesis and morphology of hydrogels,"3.1 Synthesis and morphology of hydrogels Six SA-based hydrogels (i.e., pure SA, SA/NPK, SA/CNF, SA/CNF/NPK, SA/CNF/PVA and SA/CNF/PVA/NPK) were prepared through blending and crosslinking of CNFs and SA with and without hydrophilic PVA and NPK fertilizers (Fig. 1 ). TEM micrograph shows that the average width (± standard deviation) of the studied CNFs was 12.0 (±3.0) nm (Fig. 1). CNFs had individualized fibers and formed an entangled fiber network, which made it difficult to accurately determine the length of individual CNFs. The size of the wet beads produced by combination of CNFs, SA, PVA and NPK averaged at 4.5 ± 0.5 mm. Freeze-drying (−50 °C, 5 days) produced acceptable spherical hydrogel beads. The freeze-dried beads shrank by more than half with a mean diameter of 1.9 ± 0.1 mm as shown on the SEM cross-section images. The prepared hydrogels presented a microporous shell and a macroporous core (Figs. 2–3 ). In particular, the core had numerous pores with a diameter of 8–100 μm, while the shell, as a compact membrane wrapping the core, had much smaller pores with an average diameter of 4 ± 0.5 μm. Obviously, the morphology of this core-shell structure was affected by the formation of chemical bonds and the cross-linking action. In this system, an ‘egg-box’ junction [39] with a dense/compact microporous chelated structure in the shell was achieved through crosslinking of G units in alginate chains through Ca2+ cations in the presence of PVA [40–42]. Moreover, the junctions between the chains formed in this manner were relatively stable kinetically in the presence of cations that could be packaged and coordinated. Detailed inspections of the surface structure also revealed that during the dehydration process, the polymer network partially collapsed, leading to cracks, wrinkles and micron-sized pores (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 2m, the macroporous structure in the core of the hydrogels significantly increased its surface area, helping promote the mobility (or adsorption) of fertilizer ions (i.e., N, P and K in Fig. 2o) and the capability of adsorbing water molecules within/between the networks. Additionally, white flake-like fertilizer crystals were present in the SA/NPK and SA/CNF/NPK hydrogel samples (Fig. 2), respectively. For a better understanding of the alginate structure in the presence of Ca2+, the crosslinking between pure G-rich alginate polymer chains and Ca cations is also shown (Fig. 3). In this ‘egg-box’ model, pairs of 21-related helical chains were packed with Ca2+ located between them [39,43]. Among those functional groups, the G groups [i.e., poly(guluronate) units] in the alginate cross-linked with Ca cations in the presence of PVA to form a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (s-IPN)-like structure [29,44,45]. As one component of the hydrogels, the cellulose in the s-IPN structure could interact with both SA and PVA in a cross-linked network [14,15]. The incorporated CNFs (Fig. 3) were well-dispersed in the PVA-SA matrices, which led to a significant increase in the gels' mechanical properties [14,46–48]. For the core, the network was formed by crosslinking SA and PVA in the presence of the cellulose network [32,36], via hydrogen bonding and van-der-Waals interactions to facilitate the formation of a three-dimensional hydrophilic network [14,47]. Furthermore, for the SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogel, phosphate ions (PO4 3−), as the source of P element in the hydrogel, can provide covalent bonding with carboxylate groups of SA and hydrogen bonding among all three components. Besides, the other ions of NPK ingredients such as potassium ion (K+) and ammonium ion (NH4 +) are distributed on the surface and also within the pores of the hydrogel composite. It should be noted that the interlinked pores of the SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogel can delay dissolution of loaded fertilizer into swelling medium and results in the slow release behavior of the formulation."
10,Structural characterization of the hydrogels,"3.2 Structural characterization of the hydrogels FT-IR spectra of SA-based hydrogels were collected and are shown in Fig. S1a. The FT-IR spectra of SA shows major peaks at 1600 cm−1 due to CO stretching of the carboxylic group, 2016 cm−1 (CH stretching vibration), 3231 cm−1 (free OH groups). Moreover, 1414 cm−1 peak was assigned to asymmetric and symmetric stretching of carboxyl anions salt groups, while 1030 cm−1 corresponded to its saccharide structure (COC stretching from cyclic ether bridge) [58–60]. Analysis of the SA/CNF/PVA hydrogel showed new FT-IR peaks. The weak peaks at 3238–4000 cm−1 appeared in comparison with those of the SA/CNF samples, indicating that the CH stretching was the main contributor [23,25,26]. Additionally, two characteristic bands at 2876 and 665 cm−1 were present in the SA/CNF/PVA sample, which corresponded to the CH stretching and out-of-plane OH vibrations of PVA, respectively [22,24,49]. With respect to the SA/CNF hydrogels, some new peaks at 1800, 1967 and 2019 cm−1 could be due to the CH bending vibration, CO and CO stretching from acetate group [36]. To explore the cross-linking mechanism between NPK and SA, CNF and PVA, we also investigated the FT-IR spectrum of the SA/CNF/NPK and SA/CNF/PVA/NPK (Fig. S1a). The FT-IR spectrum of the SA/CNF/NPK with respect to the SA/CNF samples showed slight shifts in the peaks because of the NPK. Moreover, a significant new peak at 606 cm−1 caused by the phosphate (PO4 3−) vibration [11] was observed, suggesting that the formation of OCOP bond with Ca2+ complex, while P element presented in the SA/CNF/NPK beads (Fig. S1a). For SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogel, after crosslinking in case of PO4 3−, the characteristic peak (CO stretching of the carboxylic (COOH) group) of SA was changed due to the formation of OCOP bonding through the interaction of hydroxyl (OH) groups of H3PO4 environment with acetate group (COO−) of SA [36]. Interestingly, PO remained intact and did not participate in the reaction, which could be confirmed by the presence of a peak 2001 cm−1 due to PO bonding. Owing to the formation of POC bond, a new peak at 2142 cm−1 was also observed [13,55,57]. The WXRD patterns of six prepared hydrogel samples were measured (Fig. S1b). A weak and broad diffraction peak of pure SA sample at around 41.5° (2θ) was recorded, which is a characteristic pattern for amorphous alginate [13,19,23,50]. In the XRD patterns of the SA/CNF hydrogels, two new diffraction peaks at 2θ = 22.3° (sharper peak) and at 2θ = 16.2° (weaker peak) were observed, corresponding to the (200) and (110) reflection planes of the typical cellulose I structure [14,30]. Compared with the SA/CNF hydrogels, the SA/CNF/PVA sample showed three new and weak diffraction peaks at around 21.0°, 31.7° and 34.3°, due to the orthorhombic lattice structure of semi-crystalline PVA [23]. In the case of NPK, six strong characteristic peaks of NPK fertilizer at 2θ = 11.6°, 21.0°, 28.2°, 40.4°, 45.4° and 50.1° were observed, demonstrating that the crystalline nature of NPK compounds in the SA-based hydrogels was retained in the hydrogel nanocomposites [11,50,51]. All the XRD patterns of SA/CNF/PVA-based hydrogels show associated characteristic peaks of PVA, SA, and CNFs. Among them, these sharp diffraction peaks indicate the existence of the components in the SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogels. Interestingly, functional groups after crosslinking were undergone significant changes in structure and crystalline behavior of hydrogels, indicating effect on micro/nano-structure and pore-interconnectivity of the hydrogels [14,36]."
11,Water-retention characteristics and swelling kinetics,"3.3 Water-retention characteristics and swelling kinetics To obtain a proper CNF concentration for the preparation of SA-based hydrogels with strong capacity of water absorption and retention in water and soil, we synthesized five different pure CNF hydrogels. The swelling kinetics and equilibrium water-absorption capacity of these freeze-dried CNF hydrogels in deionized water are shown in Figs. 4 and S2. The swelling ratios of all pure CNF hydrogel samples increased rapidly during the initial hours (from 0 to 20 h; Fig. S2a), which was mainly due to a large number of free adsorption sites on the pore surface of these hydrogels [52]. The swelling ratios depended on the polymer hydrophilicity, degree of crosslinking, and presence of electrical charges. Subsequently, their growth rate slowed down until the equilibrium water-absorption capacity was reached. In comparison with the other four CNF hydrogels, the highest swelling ratio was 8.0 g/g at 0.5 wt% CNF concentration (Fig. 4a). Since CNFs had many hydroxyl groups on their surface, the CNF-based hydrogels were formed at a low concentration by the entanglement of the nanofibers [14,48]. Several studies also reported that at low solid content of about 0.5%, the fibril dispersion was reversible for a physical gel that was held together by fibril entanglement (e.g., [27,53]). Accordingly, the equilibrium swelling ratio of the CNF-based hydrogels was affected by the applied CNF concentration. For further investigation of the effects of SA-based hydrogel compositions on water absorption capacity, hydrogel samples with different compositions were synthesized and measured (Figs. 4, S2). In the presence of 0.5 wt% CNF, the swelling ratios of the SA/CNF hydrogels first increased and then decreased as the SA dosage increased, and the highest equilibrium ratio of 12.42 g/g was shown at the 1.5 wt% SA concentration. The equilibrium swelling ratios for samples with 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 wt% SA were 95.5, 100.9, 112.4, and 91.6 g/g, respectively. An explanation for this finding is that the increased crosslinking density with higher SA concentrations resulted in a closer and smaller network space in the polymer matrix to accommodate water swelling, while lower SA concentrations did not form a three-dimensional hydrophilic network with effective water swelling [35,42,54]. This phenomenon mainly depends on the diffusion of water and the ionization of the groups during the swelling process [55]. As stated by Rehage et al. [56], if the ionization rate was much slower than diffusion, the ionization rate was limited by the non-Fickian swelling kinetics. With the increase of SA dosage, more groups (e.g., COOH and COONa) were ionized resulting in an increase in the ionization rate but in a decrease in the kinetic exponent. After freeze-drying, however, these groups synthesized at lower SA concentrations could be impeded in a compact structure. Moreover, the equilibrium swelling ratios of PVA/SA hydrogels were generally enhanced with increased PVA concentration because PVA was more hydrophilic compared with SA [57]. In the presence of 1.5 wt% SA and 0.5 wt% CNF in these hydrogels, higher PVA amount hindered physical crosslinking, making it more difficult for non-covalent crosslinking of PVA [58]. Consequently, the equilibrium swelling capacity of the SA/CNF/PVA hydrogels decreased with increased PVA concentrations, although all five hydrogels exhibited similar tendencies of swelling kinetics. Previously, Xie et al. [55] reported that the SA/PVA hydrogels (at 5 wt%) cross-linked with calcium chloride using a freeze-thaw process exhibited a low swelling ratio of 20.0 g/g. For swelling kinetics of six target hydrogels, accordingly, the SA/CNF/PVA and SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogels presented a higher equilibrium swelling capacity (between 60 and 70 g/g) than the other hydrogels (at around 120 g/g; Fig. 5 ). After analysis, the order of equilibrium swelling capacity is: SA/CNF/PVA > SA/CNF/PVA/NPK > SA/CNF > SA/CNF/NPK ≥ SA/NPK > SA (Fig. 6 ). Collectively, the optimum amounts of CNF, SA and PVA are 0.5, 1.5, and 0.5 wt%, respectively, which led to a higher water absorbency capacity for the prepared hydrogels. To understand the water retaining characteristics of prepared hydrogels in natural soil, we carried out a water-retention investigation with the mixed soils (sandy soil: loam soil = 3:1; Fig. 7 ). During the 60-day measurement period, the addition of freeze-dried SA/CNF/PVA and SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogels in the mixed soil maintained soil moisture well and reduced water evaporation. On the 60th day, the water-retention ratio of prepared hydrogels is in the following order: SA/CNF/PVA/NPK > SA/CNF/PVA > SA/CNF/NPK > SA/CNF > SA/NPK > SA > Control (Fig. 7). The leveling tendency of most of the hydrogels suggested that they became more stable gradually near the 50th day. Therefore, this finding indicates that the hydrogel networks composed of PVA, SA and CNFs improved the soil water retention after they were incorporated into the mixed soil. From a thermodynamic point of view, the swelling behavior of hydrogels depends on the delicate equilibrium between Gibbs free energy of polymer-water mixing and Gibbs free energy associated with the elastic properties of polymer networks [19,30,40]. When the water absorption swelling balance is reached, the partial molar amounts of these free energies become equivalent [52,59]. The presence of specific functional groups along the hydrogel backbone polymer chain, the swelling behavior of hydrogels, and associated release kinetics may be sensitive to physiological conditions and therefore rely on physiological pH and ionic strength [20,23,30]. In this study, the swelling behavior of SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogels at various pH values between 3.0 and 11.0 was also measured (Figs. 8 , S3). The equilibrium swelling capacity of the freeze-dried SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogels increased as the pH increased from 3.0 to 6.0, then stabilized over a pH range of 6.0 to 8.0 (maximum at pH 7.0), and decreased at higher pH levels from 8.0 to at 11.0 (Fig. 8), indicating a pH-sensitive swelling behavior. In an acidic solution, most carboxylate (COO−) groups are protonated into carboxylic acids (COOH), thus preventing anion–anion electrostatic repulsion [11,55]. In the pH range from 6.0 to 8.0, the COOH groups tend to be ionized into COO− groups, which eventually enhance the network stretching and the swelling capacity of the hydrogels resulting from the increasing electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged carboxylates [23,30]. Consequently, the water absorption capacity of the hydrogels was significantly decreased. At pH levels higher than 8.0, the Na+/K+ in the solution could be exchanged with the Ca2+ in the homopolymeric poly(guluronate) (G-block) and poly(mannuronate) (M-block) of the alginate/SA structure, resulting in the breakdown of some CO2− Ca2+ −2OC crosslink points and thus the reduction of swelling capacity [23,50,52]. Nevertheless, the ionic strength of environmental physiology affects the swelling of the hydrogels. The swelling ratios of the SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogels in all salt and alkali solutions were markedly lower than those in deionized water (Figs. 8, S3), which could be attributed to the osmotic pressure and elastic traits of the hydrogel networks [11,60]. Besides, the charge-blocking effects or shielding of the COO− anions from the monovalent cation helped reduce repulsive forces and osmotic pressure, thereby reducing the swelling ratio of the hydrogel network [60]. The polyvalent cations (e.g., Ca2+) could form new crosslinks in the hydrogels, resulting in an increased crosslinking density of the network and decreasing swelling ratio of the hydrogels, while the monovalent cations break the crosslinks (Fig. S3; [52,55,61])."
12,NPK slow-release behavior in water and soil,"3.4 NPK slow-release behavior in water and soil The fertilizer-release behavior and corresponding swelling capacity of prepared hydrogels are generally the result of crosslinking (i.e., tiepoints or junctions), permanent entanglement, ionic interactions, or association of microcrystalline regions of various chains [17,19,20,32,52,62]. To investigate the release mechanisms of hydrogel-loaded fertilizers in different media, we examined the NPK-release dynamics of three synthesized hydrogels (i.e., SA/NPK, SA/CNF/NPK and SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogels) in deionized water and in mixed soils (Fig. 9 ). In water, a rapid 10-day maximum release in the SA/NPK hydrogels was observed. The cumulative release ratios of N, P, and K in SA/NPK hydrogels was 0.54%, 0.57%, and 1.00% on the first day, and 7.58%, 6.87% and 8.62% on the tenth day, while the K release was clearly higher than N and P (Fig. 9a). This rapid, small amount of release behavior is due to the fact that in the presence of Ca2+, pure SA formed a micro-porous ‘egg-box’ shell but exhibited a macroporous core. Upon crosslinking with SA, CNF and/or PVA, the cumulative release of NPK fertilizers in SA/CNF/NPK (Fig. 9c) and SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogels (Fig. 9e) was higher and slower than those in SA/NPK hydrogels (Fig. 9a). The N, P and K in SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogels released 14.03%, 11.95%, 7.33% within a day and 67.90%, 70.78%, and 71.12% within 30 days. The release of N, P and K from SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogels was, respectively, 0.06%, 0.01%, and 0.01% within 1 day and 24.82%, 36.21%, and 50.17% within 30 days. Since the total release of the target fertilizer was reduced by 15% on the first day and by no more than 75% on the 30th day, the slow-release properties of the two hydrogels are in line with the slow-release fertilizer standard of the European Committee for Standardization [63]. In the soil, except for the NPK release of SA/NPK and SA/CNF/NPK hydrogels, the NPK-release pattern of all hydrothermal hydrogels was almost similar to those in water (Figs. 9b, d, f), which could be attributed to the ionic properties of the soil that reduced the swelling capacity and subsequently affected the amount of fertilizer released [40,50,51]. An alternative explanation is that less free-water in soils induced lower water exchange rates, resulting in the reduction of the fertilizer-release rate [11]. A slower NPK-release process in soils was observed in SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogels (Fig. 9f). In particular, the cumulative release of N, P and K was 24.73, 18.59, and 25.92% on day 10 and 64.52, 53.72, and 64.08% on day 30, respectively. These were lower than the NPK-release amounts on the same days in water, although the N-release at the 60th day in soils was higher than that in water (79.48% vs. 72.73%; Fig. 9e). To understand the slow-release mechanism of fertilizer-loaded hydrogels, we employed the release kinetics model proposed by Korsmeyer et al. [64]: (4) M t M ∞ = Kt n where M t represents the amount of fertilizer-release at t, M ∞ represents the current total release amount, K is the kinetic constant, and n is the diffusion parameter for determining the kinetic mode (i.e., n ≥ 0.5 for Fickian diffusion, 0.5 < n < 1.0 for abnormal diffusion or erosion, n = 1.0 for Case II transport/release controlled to zero by polymer relaxation, and n > 1.0 for Super-Case II transport/release controlled by erosion). In the current work, the n values from SA/CNF/NPK and SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogels releasing in both water and soil are less than 0.5, whereas the n values from SA/NPK hydrogels are more than 1.0 (Table S2). These findings suggest that the NPK-release of the SA/CNF/NPK and SA/CNF/PVA/NPK hydrogels in water and soil was controlled by Fickian diffusion, while the release in SA/NPK hydrogels is controlled by erosion as Super-Case II transportation [50,56,64]. Based on the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, we hypothesize the release mechanism of SA/CNF-based hydrogels in the medium (water or soil) as follows. First, the freeze-dried SA/CNF-based gels were slowly swelled by water and converted to hydrogels in the medium. Subsequently, the NPK fertilizers encapsulated in the hydrogel were slowly dissolved. Second, the fertilizers were slowly released to the medium by dynamic exchange (or by diffusion control) between the inside and outside of the hydrogels [32,34,52]. With the increase of swelling ratio, the macroporous size in the three-dimensional networks was enlarged to facilitate diffusion of the fertilizer to the medium [10,17,58]. Finally, the release rate of the fertilizers in the medium was reduced, approaching a constant value at the end."
13,Conclusions,"In this work, we presented the SA/CNF/PVA/NPK nanocomposite hydrogels as a novel slow-release fertilizer to overcome long standing challenges of convention fertilizers (e.g., over-use and uncontrolled chemical releases). The hydrogels were fabricated via blending and crosslinking SA, CNF and PVA in the presence of NPK fertilizers without using toxic solvents. The hydrogels had a macroporous flexible core reinforced with CNFs via inter-/intra-molecular hydrogen bonds and a microporous rigid semi-IPN shell through chelation and covalent bonding of SA-PVA with Ca cations. Such materials and structure configuration significantly improved mechanical strength and water absorption capability, while maintaining the crystalline nature of NPK in the hydrogel. A good physiological pH and salt/alkali sensitivity was recorded, and NPK fertilizers in the SA/CNF/NPK and SA/CNF/PVA/NPK systems were slowly released following the Fickian diffusion process in distilled water and mixed soil. We envision that the hydrogel systems presented herein holds a great deal of promise as a slow-release fertilizer and soil/water regulating agent in the drought-prone environments for future precision agriculture and horticulture applications."
