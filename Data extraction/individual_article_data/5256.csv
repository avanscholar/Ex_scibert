0,Introduction,"Internal combustion engines have widely been using in many areas from transportation to power production. Especially diesel engines have prominent advantages such as high energy efficiency, high stability and being flexible for various operating conditions [1,2]. In today’s world, ICEs highly depend on conventional petroleum-based fuels. This dependency creates inevitable problems since conventional fuels face with scarcity issue due to growing populations and industrialization. Therefore, scientists are trying to find renewable, sustainable and clean alternatives to fossil fuels. Beside depletion of fossil fuels, strict emission regulations have also forced scientists to search new alternatives [3–6]. Biodiesel can be produced from various feedstocks. Generally, feedstocks can be classified as edible or non-edible vegetable oil, waste or recycled oil and animal fats [7]. Environmental and agricultural conditions, availability of soil, geographical locations are main factors for selection of feedstocks [8]. Especially, waste cooking oil (WCO) is prominent among other feedstocks with its being relatively cheaper for biodiesel production [9]. Feedstock cost can be reduced and removal of waste oil problem can be achieved by converting WCO into biodiesel. WCO is a very big problem in hotels and public eateries [7]. There are various studies which deal with performance, emission and fuel properties of WCO biodiesel operated internal combustion engines as an alternative potential fuel [10–14]. Another potential energy source to replace conventional fossil fuels is hydrogen. Hydrogen is well-known for its being clean and environmentally friendly energy. It generates water after combustion [15]. Hydrogen is naturally available and it can also be produced from different sources [16]. In literature, various studies can be found in which hydrogen gas is used as an additive to main fuel [4,17–20]. Besides usability of alternative fuels such as biodiesel, hydrogen etc. from the perspective of their performance, combustion and emission characteristics, vibration produced by the engine is another important phenomenon [21,22]. Recently, scientists have been trying to reduce vibration of engines since it is very crucial for comfort conditions and mechanical damages. Therefore, automotive manufacturers have forced to develop their products to be able to meet customer demands for high competition in the sector [23]. In this respect, researchers have studied vibration behaviour of internal combustion engines supplied by various fuels. Uludamar et al. (2017) evaluated vibration behaviour of a hydroxyl (HHO) gas generator installed compression ignition engine operated with different diesel-biodiesel mixtures. The experiment resulted showed that the HHO addition was improved the vibration acceleration of engine block [24]. Çelebi et al. (2017) determined noise and vibration characteristic of a diesel engine fuelled with diesel fuel-biodiesel blends with the addition of natural gas. Their results indicated that both biodiesel and natural gas addition decreased engine vibration severity [25]. Torregrosa et al. (2017) studied the impact of gasoline and diesel blends on combustion noise and emissions in premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) engines [26]. Taghizadeh-Alisaraei et al. (2012) performed vibration analysis of a compression ignition engine operated with biodiesel and petrodiesel fuel mixtures. In their experiments, effect of biodiesel changed with engine speed [27]. Heidary et al. (2013) made vibration analysis of a diesel engine which uses diesel-biodiesel mixtures. Their intent was to find fuels with minimum vibration level [28]. In this study, a diesel engine was fuelled with alternative fuel and conventional diesel fuel. WCO was used as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Hydrogen gas was also supplied with intake air through experiments. Biodiesel and hydrogen gas effect on a vibration characteristic of the engine were investigated. The engine was operated with diesel, biodiesel, conventional diesel-hydrogen, biodiesel-hydrogen fuels. Here, conventional diesel fuel was used as reference fuel to compare with others."
1,Material and method,"In this study, vibration characteristic of conventional diesel and WCO biodiesel fuelled compression ignition engine was determined. The experiments were also repeated with hydrogen addition into intake manifold to see how hydrogen gas affects vibration of the engine. Biodiesel was produced by using waste cooking oil. If there is high FFA content in triglyceride, alkali-catalyzed transesterification reaction will not be able to occur efficiently [29]. Since oil has high free fatty acid (FFA) value, it was reduced by use of acid catalysis which is a pre-treatment method firstly. In transesterification method, sodium hydroxide and methanol were selected as catalyst and alcohol, respectively. Then, oil was mixed with alcohol and catalyst and was heated until the thermometer showed a temperature of 60 °C before the reaction. The mixture was stirred 1 h at the same temperature. Crude methyl ester was held at funnel for 8 h to separate the glycerine from methyl ester. The separated crude methyl ester was washed in warm water and then it is subjected to drying process at 105 °C for 1 h. At the last, methyl ester was passed through a filter and pure biodiesel was obtained. After the production of the biodiesel fuel, some critical fuel properties were measured according to European Standards to determine the usability of the experimental fuel in the test engine. Kyoto electronics DA-130, Zeltex ZX440, IKA-Werke C2000 Bomb Calorimeter, AKV-202 Auto Kinematic Viscosity were used to measure the density, cetane, heating value (calorific value) and viscosity and for cetane number, of the test fuels, respectively. Fuel properties of conventional diesel and WCO biodiesel fuels were given in Table 1 . Experimental studies were performed on a 4-stroke, 4-cylinder, naturally aspirated compression ignition engine (Mitsubishi Canter 4D34-2A). The other specification of the experimental engine was presented in Table 2 . H2 gas was supplied to the intake manifold with a flow rate of 5 L per minute (l/min) and sent to the engine with the air charge. Experiments were conducted at 1200–2400 rpm range under full load condition and the data was collected at 300 rpm intervals. Schematic of the experimental engine was shown in Fig. 1 . The accelerometer of PCB Electronics (Triaxial ICP®, Model No: 356A33) was used to measure vibration. The sensor was bonded to engine support with quick adherent gel. Data was recorded in 3 orthogonal axes (x-longitudinal axis, y-lateral axis, z-vertical axis) (see Fig. 2 ). The vibration data was gathered via the universal portable measuring system of SINUS Messtechnik GmbH (Soundbook™) operated by SAMURAI v2.6 software and the Toughbook™ CF-18 portable Panasonic computer. RMS values were used for vibration results which are related with a measure of vibration level providing an amplitude value with respect to the time history of the wave. RMS value was calculated by use of following formula: a w = 1 T ∫ 0 T a w 2 ( t ) dt where aw (m/s2) is weighted acceleration, T is measurement time. atotal (total vibration acceleration) can be described as combination of three axes accelerations and can be expressed by: a total = a vertical 2 + a lateral 2 + a longitudinal 2"
2,Results and discussions,"Experiments were performed with four different fuel, namely, conventional diesel, WCO biodiesel, conventional diesel-hydrogen gas and WCO biodiesel-hydrogen gas. The vibration results of all remaining three were compared with conventional diesel fuelled engine which was used as reference fuel. The engine was operated in between 1200 and 2400 engine speed with an interval of 300 rpm at no load condition. Vibration data was taken from engine support to see engine vibration level just before transferred to the chassis. The highest arms values were measured in z-axis due to the movement of the upward and downward cylinder. Vertical movement transmitted to longitudinal by the crankshaft. Therefore, the second highest arms occurred in the longitudinal direction. The vibration in the lateral axis generally depends on auxiliary equipment of the engine or transmission from other directions. This phenomenon resulted in the lowest vibration acceleration in the direction of the lateral axis. From Figs. 3–8 , it illustrated that the engine speed has a prominent effect on engine block vibration. Total arms were measured between 20 and 22 m/s2 at 1200 rpm whereas 40–48 m/s2 occurred at 2400 engine speed. The reason of increment could depend on the acceleration of engine cylinders. In all engine speeds, the highest engine vibration acceleration was recorded with the use of conventional diesel fuel. Usage of WCO biodiesel decreased the vibration level. The decrement was measured 3.6% with WCO biodiesel fuel compared to conventional diesel fuel. The extra oxygen content of biodiesel fuel has a positive effect on combustion quality. Therefore, ignition delay time reduced with biodiesel usage compared with conventional diesel fuel. H2 has also effect on vibration acceleration reduction when the engine fuelled with conventional diesel and biodiesel fuel. Introduction of H2 has diminished the vibration by 1.5% and 4.0%, respectively when the engine fuel was conventional diesel and WCO biodiesel. Fast combustion speed of H2 has an effect on ignition delay time. Less ignition delay time generally results in the less mixing-controlled combustion phase. This relation has an advantage until the pressure peak point is getting closer to 0° crank angle. Reduction of ignition delay time and late combustion may cause the decrement of vibration acceleration of engine block."
3,Conclusions,"The aim of this study is to observe vibration characteristic of a compression ignition engine in three orthogonal axes. On the other hand, it was investigated that how are WCO biodiesel and hydrogen addition through intake manifold affecting vibration level of the engine. All vibration data was taken from engine support with the help of an accelerometer. Following conclusions were obtained from the experiments. • Engine speed has a considerable effect on engine vibration. When engine speed increases, vibration level also increases. • WCO biodiesel usage instead of pure conventional diesel decreased engine vibration since there was enhanced combustion and reduced ignition delay period due to the extra oxygen content of biodiesel. • Hydrogen addition through intake manifold further lowered vibration level both in conventional diesel and biodiesel usage. Minimum vibration level was obtained with use of WCO biodiesel-H2 gas operated engine."
