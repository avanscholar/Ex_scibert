0,Introduction,"Biomass is one of the most plentiful resources of renewable energy existed in the world [1–3]. An imperative current challenge for researchers, industry, engineering and government is the development of efficient technologies that utilize biomass or biomass-derived chemicals to the largest extent [3–5]. In most of the approaches being investigated, the platform intermediate furfural and levulinic acid (LA) were often hydrogenated to the value-added chemicals (e.g. FA (furfuryl alcohol), GVL (γ-valerolactone)) and attractive biofuels (e.g. MF (2-methylfuran), GVL) [6–9]. Arising from the reduction of the carbonyl group (CO), FA could be produced as shown in Scheme 1 a, it is a commercial product as green solvent and has been widely employed in the biorefinery and pharmaceutical industry [10,11]. It is soluble in common organic solvents and miscible with water [12], thus it is often used as a chemical building block for pharmaceutical drug synthesis [12]. In principle, FA can be selectively produced through the cleavage of CO bond. However, many side compounds are often simultaneously produced from the secondary or side reactions (e.g. hydrogenation to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), hydrogenolysis of FA to MF, decarbonylation of furfural to furan) [6,10,11]. Developing an efficient catalytic system for the highly selective production of FA is becoming vital. In the last decades, different types of catalysts have been developed for the production of FA. Homogeneous catalysts based on Ru- or Rh-complex often appeared very attractive, high conversion (over 90%) as well as good selectivity of FA (over 95%) were obtained [13–15]. Due to its environmental benignity, easier recycle and reuse, heterogeneous catalyst display more attractive. The hydrogenation of furfural has been studied using the noble-metal catalysts (e.g. Ru, Pd and Pt). Sometimes another metal (e.g. Sn) or promoter (e.g. heteropoly acids, CO2) is added to improve the catalytic performance [16–19]. Among the various heterogeneous catalysts, copper catalysts (Cu-nanoparticles and copper chromite) have been shown to preferentially cleave C–O bond for the production of FA with minor C–C cleavage or hydrogenation of the furan ring [17,19,20]. It was found that the molecularly adsorbed furfural interacted with the Cu surface via the lone pair of oxygen [20], which played a crucial role in the selective hydrogenation. For the typical copper chromite (Cu2Cr2O5) catalyst, Cu0 and/or Cu+ species were often claimed as primary active species in the catalytic cycle [21,22]. Recently, Cu0 was also reported to be the active specie and primarily responsible for the activity in the C–O hydrogenolysis of 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol [23]. These above-mentioned catalytic systems using noble-metal and copper chromite were advanced, however, the catalytic performance was still relatively low, the high cost of noble-metal, the easy deactivation and limited stability of the Cu-catalysts were a problem, which would influence the application [24,25]. An efficient, cheap and stable catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of furfural is still largely needed. Through the hydrogenation of LA, GVL can be produced. It was recently proposed that GVL, a frequently used food additive, exhibits the most important characteristics of an ideal green solvent possibly for the production of either energy or carbon-based consumer products [7,26,27]. In addition, GVL does not form peroxides in a glass flask under air in weeks, making it a safe material for large scale use. Comparative evaluation of GVL and ethanol as fuel additives shows very similar properties [28]. The hydrogenation of LA to GVL using the homogeneous Ru-complex catalysts often appeared very attractive [29–31]. However, the recovering of the expensive metal catalysts from the reaction residue is still a challenge. Subsequently, the supported metal catalysts were often employed, the typical hydrogenation of LA to GVL have been performed in solvent free or in organic solvents like dioxane, ethylether [32–34]. Chang et al. [35] reported that carbon supported Ru, Pt and Pd noble metal for the selective hydrogenation of LA under vapour phase in a continuous down flow fixed-bed reactor system, where 5% Ru/C catalyst gave GVL with perfect selectivity. Although the employed Ru catalysts display good performance, the expensive cost and easy deactivation of Ru catalysts would greatly limit their utilizations [33]. In this work, a stable and noble-metal-free Cu–Cr catalyst was facilely and successfully synthesized by a modified co-precipitation method using the cheap metal nitrates. The Cu–Cr catalysts were systematically studied for the hydrogenation of biomass-derived furfural and LA. In the hydrogenation of furfural, 95% yield of FA was highly selectively achieved at 99% conversion of furfural. For the hydrogenation of LA, 90% yield of GVL was highly selectively produced at 97.8% conversion. Subsequently, the reaction parameters (e.g. Cu2+/Cr3+ ratios, reaction temperature with time, and hydrogen pressure) and catalyst stability were systematically studied."
1,Material and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation All the chemicals were directly used after purchase. The methodology for the synthesis of Cu–Cr catalysts is shown in Fig. S1 (in the Supplementary Information). The Cu–Cr hydrotalcite precursor was transferred to the metal oxides by heating to a certain temperature, which involved dehydration, dehydroxylation, decomposition of anions, formation of oxide and spinel in series or in overlapping manner (more details are described in the Supplementary Information) [36–39]. In the first step, the Cu–Cr hydrotalcite precursor was synthesized using a modified co-precipitation method [35,37]. The typical procedure was as following: one solution (A) containing the precalculated amount of metal nitrates of 1 mol/L Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and 1 mol/L Cu(NO3)2·3H2O with different Cu2+/Cr3+ ratios (0.5, 1, 2) and the other (B) with precipitating agent solution (1 mol/L NaOH), were added simultaneously into a 250 mL beaker, and the pH value was kept in the range of 5.5–6.0 under the vigorous stirring at room temperature. The obtained slurry was further aged for 0.5 h under vigorous stirring and then transferred into Teflon-lined autoclave for hydrothermal treatment. The autoclave was maintained at 120 °C for 6 h in the oven. Thereafter the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and rinsed three times using the distilled water. Finally, the obtained powder was dried at 80 °C for 12 h and the Cu–Cr hydrotalcite precursor was achieved. In the second step, the Cu–Cr catalyst was obtained through the calcination of Cu–Cr hydrotalcite precursor at 950 °C for 10 h with a heating rate of 2 °C/min in the air oven. The resultant Cu–Cr catalyst with the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio of 0.5, 1 and 2, hereafter defined as Cu–Cr0.5, Cu–Cr1 and Cu–Cr2."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for qualitative phase analysis were collected on a Phillips PW 1050–3710 transmission diffract meter with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) with intervals of 0.05°. For the hydrotalcite precursors, the data were collected in the range of 5–85° with a step width of 0.05°/2θ. For the calcinated Cu–Cr catalysts, the data were collected in the range of 15–85° with a step width of 0.05°/2θ. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were performed on WCT-2 differential thermal balance using flowing N2. Samples were dried at 100 °C for 24 h prior to analysis and ∼10 mg samples were heated at a heating rate of 10 °C/min up to 1000 °C. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate structural features of the catalysts with a JEOL 2010 instrument. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) was obtained with Hitachi SU-70 operating at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with hemispherical analyzer and monochromatized AlKα X-ray source (E = 1486.6 eV), operated at 15 kV and 15 mA. For the narrow scans, analyzer pass energy of 40 eV was applied."
4,Selective hydrogenation of furfural,"2.3 Selective hydrogenation of furfural The hydrogenation of furfural was performed in a 25 mL micro-autoclave (Parr Company) with an internal glass reactor. 2.0 mL furfural was added into 5 mL octane solvent followed by the addition of 0.1 g catalyst. In order to remove the air, the autoclave was slowly flushed with argon three times before it was charged with hydrogen. A stirring speed of 1000 rpm was employed through the whole reaction procedure. Reaction time zero (t 0) was defined when the inner temperature of the autoclave reached the desired temperature. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature using a water bath. The product mixture was firstly centrifuged at the speed of 3000 rpm for 30 min, and then by a filtration and followed by the dilution using dichloromethane. The subsequent samples were analyzed by GC (Shimadzu 2014, column: 30 m SE-54, FID) using external method. The column temperature was raised from 40 °C to 250 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The injector temperature was 350 °C, which was loaded with a sample volume of 2 μL."
5,Hydrogenation of LA,"2.4 Hydrogenation of LA The hydrogenation of LA into GVL was performed in a 25 mL micro-autoclave. The typical procedure was as following: 1.02 g LA was dissolved in 5 mL deionized water followed by the addition of ∼100 mg catalyst. To remove the internal air, the autoclave was slowly flushed with argon three times before hydrogen was input. A stirring speed of 1000 rpm was employed through the whole reaction procedure. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature using a water bath. The product mixture was firstly centrifuged at the speed of 3000 rpm for 30 min, and then filtrated to obtain the clear solution. In the end, 1-hexanol was added as internal standard and then dilution using acetone. The subsequent samples were analyzed by GC (Shimadzu 2014, and column: 30 m DBWaxetr, FID). The column temperature was raised from 40 to 250 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C/min. The injector temperature was 350 °C, which was loaded with a sampling volume of 0.2 μL."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. S2) of Cu–Cr hydrotalcite precursor indicated that Cu–Cr hydrotalcite precursors were single phase and well crystallized with the hydrotalcite-type structure, where the characteristic peaks of hydrotalcite indexed as (003) at 10.2°, (006) at 20.1°, (009) at 34.5°, (110) at 60.5° [38,40,41]. Fig. S3 shows the representative TG-DTA analysis of Cu–Cr hydrotalcite with the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio of 2. DTA curve of Cu–Cr hydrotalcite showed a weak peak at ∼105 °C, which was associated with the loss of the physisorbed water. The second sharp appeared peak at ∼280 °C, corresponding to the loss of coordination water between the hydrotalcite layers. The peaks appeared between 500 and 660 °C, which were due to the elimination of the hydroxyl groups and the removal of nitrate groups in the form of H2O and NOx, thus transforming the hydrotalcite into the mixture of metal oxide (CuO) and spinel phase (CuCr2O4) with the layered structures collapsing. After heating to above 850 °C, there was no weight loss observed due to the transformation into the stable metal oxide of CuO and spinel CuCr2O4. The XRD patterns of the resulting Cu–Cr catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . The typical peaks of 2θ indexed with (101) approximately at 19.8°, (200) at 29.6°, (112) at 31.5°, (211) at 35.2°, (202) at 37.8°, (220) at 41.0°, (321) at 56.4°, (400) at 61.5°, (411) at 64.9° and (422) at 74.9°, can be attributed to the spinel CuCr2O4 phase (PDF No. 34-0424). The typical diffraction peaks with 2θ indexed approximately at 32.3°, 36.2°, 42.2°, 53.6°, 58.1° and 71.6°, which can be assigned to the crystalline phase of CuO (PDF No. 45-0937). Additionally, with the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio increasing, the intensity of CuO peak appeared stronger, which was likely due to the vigorous Jahn–Teller effect of Cu2+. With the amount of Cu2+ increasing, it would enhance the difficulty for Cu2+ to coordinate with Cr3+ in the layer of Cu–Cr hydrotalcite [42,43], the redundant Cu2+ was transformed into CuO in the calcination procedure. The compositions of the resultant Cu–Cr catalysts have direct influence on their catalytic performances, thus EDX (Fig. S4) are employed to verify the successful incorporation of Cu2+ and Cr3+ in the catalysts. As shown in Fig. S4, the present position of two prominent Cu and Cr peaks where they are expected to be. Table S1 depicts the EDX results of numeric analysis. At low Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio of 0.5 (No. 1), the detected value was 0.45, which was very close to the initial ratio. With the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio increasing to 1 and 2, the values of 0.71 (No. 2) and 1.63 (No. 3) were obtained, respectively, which were a little lower than the initial ratios. As above-mentioned, this was possible due to the rigid Jahn–Teller effect [42,43], resulting in the slight leach of Cu2+. In general, the EDX analysis confirmed the successful incorporation of Cu2+ and Cr3+ in the Cu–Cr catalysts. The chemical state of the metal in the catalyst often presents crucial influence on its redox properties, which are vital for the understanding of the catalytic activity. Fig. S5 depicts the XPS profile of the chemical state analysis of each element in the Cu–Cr catalyst with Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio of 2. It can be noticed that the fresh catalyst exhibited the Cu 2p 3/2 main peak (Fig. S5a) at 933.5 ± 0.2 eV with an FWHM of 3.11 eV. Good satellite intensity (Is) was observed at 942 eV, indicating the existence of Cu2+ species [44]. The use of the Auger parameter (2p 3/2, L3M45M45) as well as an inspection of the Auger peak-shape will allow for a more accurate assignment for these species. The peak appeared at 935.2 eV clearly indicated that only the Cu2+ species existed (Fig. S5b). The XPS scans of the Cr 2p region (Fig. S5c) with Cr 2p1/2 and Cr 2p3/2 lines at 587.2 eV and 577.7 eV, respectively, which indicated that Cr3+ species existed in the sample. The O 1s spectrum (Fig. S5d) revealed a well-defined peak at 530.01 eV with a shoulder cantered at 531.52 eV. The peak at 530 eV was characteristic of CuO. The small shoulder peak cantered at 531.52 eV could be attributed to the presence of CuCr2O4 spinel [45,46]. Representative TEM analysis (Fig. 2 ) is further performed. Relatively uniform surface was observed in the case of Cu–Cr catalyst with the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio of 1 (Fig. 2a). With the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio increasing to 2 (Fig. 2b), larger particle with better crystallinity was observed, which further indicated that the metal oxide CuO was highly dispersed inside the fabricated Cu–Cr catalyst."
8,Catalytic hydrogenation of furfural,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogenation of furfural 3.2.1 Cu2+/Cr3+ ratios influence Fig. 3 depicts the catalytic performance of the resultant Cu–Cr catalysts. In general, the resultant Cu–Cr catalysts display good performance in the hydrogenation of furfural, where FA was mainly produced with a few amounts of THFA and MF obtained simultaneously. For the first Cu–Cr catalyst with the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio of 0.5, 12% yield of FA was observed at 20.9% conversion of furfural. With the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio increasing to 1, 32.5% yield of FA was obtained at 46.3% conversion. The best performance with 83% yield of FA was achieved at 94% conversion using the Cu–Cr catalyst with the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio of 2. These data confirmed that the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratios could alter the extent of hydrogenation, where the enhancement of the yield of FA was possible due to the presence of Cu0–M2+–M3+ sites. During the hydrogenation, the electron-deficient Cu2+ and Cr3+ could attract the oxygen in the carbonyl group (CO) through η 1 on-top adsorption and a close contact, which would activate the CO bond π-complexed to the surface of Cu–Cr catalyst, where copper was able to dissociate hydrogen, resulting in the preferred hydrogenation of the CO bond [47]. Meanwhile, the spinel CuCr2O4 could not only serve as a support, but also could create the highly unsaturated active sites and promote more homogeneous distribution of these active sites [21–23]. As well confirmed by the XRD analysis (Fig. 4 a) in the subsection of recyclability tests, the surface Cu2+ was reduced into Cu0, which was responsible for the hydrogenation of furfural. 3.2.2 Optimization of the hydrogenation of furfural Initial explore show that the resulting Cu–Cr catalyst with the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio of 2 presented the best activity, we envisaged that the yield of FA could be further enhanced through the optimization of reaction parameters. A new set of experimental design was shown in Table 1 and endeavoured to find the important factors that influenced the catalytic activities. Reaction temperature and input hydrogen pressure turned out to be the most important factors that influenced the catalytic activities. The best activity was achieved with 94.9% yield of FA at 99.2% conversion of furfural under the condition of 200 °C, 3 h and 70 bar H2 (Entry 6). Relatively poor performance was often observed at low temperature (e.g. 120 °C), the conversion was ∼8% in the first set of four runs (Entry 1–4). Better activities were achieved in the four runs (Entry 5–8) at the higher temperature of 200 °C, confirming that the hydrogenation rate was increased at the higher temperature. To further clear about the influence of reaction temperature, a range of reaction temperature (Entry 9–11) was designed. It was interesting to find that the conversion of furfural increased stably with the reaction temperature rising, which was because the high temperature would enhance the hydrogenation rate and promoted faster mass transportation. However, too high temperature (e.g. 220 °C) was found to be bad for the formation of FA (e.g. only 74.6% yield in Entry 11), the side reactions such as further hydrogenolysis of FA to MF were promoted clearly in parallel (Entry 11). Besides, at the reaction temperature of 200 °C, higher hydrogen pressure (e.g. 70 bar) was found to be beneficial for achieving higher yield of FA at a better conversion (e.g. Entry 5 vs. 6). To benchmark the resulting Cu–Cr catalysts, the catalytic performances in the hydrogenation of furfural have been compared with the representative results of the previously reported materials as shown in Table S2. In comparison, to the best of our knowledge, our results are among the top-list, which are even superior to the performances of the noble metal-based catalysts. 3.2.3 Catalyst stability in the hydrogenation of furfural The Cu–Cr catalyst with Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio of 2 exhibiting the best catalytic efﬁciency was recycled for several times to evaluate the stability. Due to the possible carbon deposits from the organic reactants or products occurred on the surface of catalyst during the catalytic reactions, 550 °C was used for the calcination to rule out the possibly adsorbed or deposited carbon species. XRD was further employed to monitor the structural evolvement between the spent and the calcined catalyst. The XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 4. As expected, Cu0 was found in the spent Cu–Cr catalyst, which indexed as (111) at 43.6°, (200) at 50.8°, (220) at 74.4°. It further confirmed that the Cu2+ on the surface was reduced into Cu0, which was responsible for the catalytic activity, where the Cu0 was possibly produced from the reduction of CuO and/or CuCr2O4. The appearance of CuCrO2 (JCPDS 74-0983) in the spent catalyst further confirmed that the partial reduction of CuCr2O4 spinel occurred, which has been confirmed by the previous studies [21,23]. On the other hand, it indicated that the hydrogenation was initially occurred on the site of CuO, where the CuCr2O4 spinel might serve as the support to create the highly unsaturated active sites and promote the more homogeneous distribution of these active sites. With the reaction proceeding, the support CuCr2O4 will be more uncovered and partially reduced into CuCrO2 (Fig. 4a). The calcination will result in the recovery of the structure and potential redispersion of the active sites on the surface (Fig. 4b), which deserves future attention to understand the structural evolvement during the calcination. In order to explore the recyclability of the Cu–Cr catalyst, the spent catalyst was separated through centrifugation at the speed of 3000 rpm for 30 min and then dried at 80 °C in the oven with air environment for 12 h. The spent catalyst was used for the hydrogenation, and catalytic results were shown in Table 2 . For the first run, 90% yield of FA was achieved at 95% conversion, which was a little lower than the values of the fresh catalyst's performance. In the second run, much lower values were obtained, where 75.3% yield was achieved at the conversion of 83.3%. This was more likely due to more carbon deposit covered on the catalyst surface after the consecutive runs [48,49]. To remove the potential carbon deposit, the spent catalyst was calcinated under 550 °C for 3 h and then used for the next run. It was interesting to find that very good performance was achieved. On the other hand, the potential redispersion of active sites occurred during the calcination, which deserves for future attention. Besides, stable conversion and yield of furfuryl alcohol was obtained in the next three runs (Run 3–5)."
9,Hydrogenation of LA,"3.3 Hydrogenation of LA The resultant Cu–Cr catalysts are further evaluated in the hydrogenation of LA and the catalytic results are depicted in Fig. 5. In general, the resultant Cu–Cr catalysts continue to display very good performances in the hydrogenation of LA. For the first Cu–Cr catalyst with the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio of 0.5, 56.7% yield of GVL was obtained at 70% conversion of LA. In the case of the second Cu–Cr catalyst with the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio of 1, 73.9% yield of GVL was obtained at 83.6% conversion. The best performance was achieved with 90.7% yield of GVL at close to perfect conversion using the Cu–Cr catalyst with the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio of 2. Besides, it was interesting to find that the Cu2+/Cr3+ ratio can alter the extent of hydrogenation, which again indicated that the copper sites were responsible for the dissociative activation of H2 and governed the catalytic performance. To better compare with previous works from literature, the catalytic performance in the hydrogenation of LA in this work has been compared with the representative results of the previously reported materials as shown in Table S3. In comparison, to our limited knowledge, our results are very good, which are even better than the noble metal catalysts."
10,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have successfully fabricated a noble-metal-free Cu–Cr catalyst derived from its hydrotalcite precursor and demonstrated that biomass-derived platform chemical furfural and LA could be efficiently hydrogenated to FA and GVL under mild conditions, respectively. In the first hydrogenation of furfural, 95% yield of FA was highly selectively produced at 99% conversion of furfural under mild conditions. For the hydrogenation of LA, 90% yield of GVL was highly selectively produced at 97.8% conversion. Besides, Cu2+/Cr3+ ratios, hydrogen pressure and reaction temperature presented important influence on the catalytic activities. The promising catalyst developed in this work may be a good candidate for the mild hydrogenation of biomass-derived monomers."
