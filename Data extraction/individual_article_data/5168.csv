0,Introduction,"The consumers are demonstrating preeminent interest towards healthy foods due to increasing prevalence of life style related chronic diseases, changing age demographics and escalating healthcare cost [1]. The virtuousness of persistent research on dietary components for potential health benefits besides growing interest for value added foods has eventually engendered the development of functional foods. Such food includes whole or fortified or enriched foods, which are contemplated to provide health benefits beyond their basic nutrition to reduce the risk of disease and promote the overall wellbeing [2]. Therefore, globally the functional food market is thriving fast [3] and wide range of food and beverage products containing added micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) or nutraceuticals such as phytosterols, carotenoids, lycopene, polyphenols etc. are becoming extremely popular. Polyphenols such as curcumin, resveratrol, catechins and quercetin are greatly extolled for antioxidant, anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties [4]. Recently, their application into food matrices is hampered by their inherent instability, low bioavailability and aqueous insolubility. Therefore, an intricate protective mechanism such as encapsulation is necessitated to maintain the biological activity of polyphenols until they reach the site of absorption. Nanoencapsulation, a process involving the incorporation of bioactive compounds into the carrier materials of nanometer range, holds the greater potential to enhance the absorption and control release of the active component at target site [5]. Niosomes are one of the current promising nanocarriers that have drawn considerable attention in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields for delivering genes, proteins, enzymes, drugs etc. Niosomes are stable bilayer vesicles formed through the self-assembly of non-ionic surfactants in the aqueous solution [6]. Further, the stability of niosomes is improved by the incorporation of a stabilizer, usually, cholesterol [7]. The widely acclaimed advantage of niosomes has been encapsulation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds; further they are remarkably cheap, non-toxic and bio-compatible in nature. Recently, there have been reports on food applications of niosomes as delivery vehicles for polyphenols [8,9], vitamin E [10], vitamin D3 [11] and iron [12]. Resveratrol (trans-3, 4′, 5-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural polyphenol chiefly renowned for its role in cardio protection. It exists as cis- and trans- forms in nature; only trans- form is biologically active demonstrating the ability to inhibit the LDL oxidation, suppress cyclo-oxygenase-2, support nitric oxide synthesis and improve cellular resistance to oxidative stress, enabling it to demonstrate cardio protection, cancer prevention, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities [13,14]. These accomplished health benefits corroborate the use of resveratrol as a potential ingredient for functional foods. However, utilization of resveratrol remains limited owing to its high photosensitivity, chemical instability, short biological half-life and rapid degradation in GI tract [15,16]. In recent times, there were reports on the employment of nanocarriers like coacervates, liposomes, nanoemulsions, molecular inclusions to improve the solubility, stability and biological activity of resveratrol, prevent its metabolic degradation and enable the controlled release [14,17]. A few disadvantages of such techniques include expensive encapsulating materials, costly equipment, non-food grade substances and formation of unstable nanoparticles. In the present study, resveratrol was nanoencapsulated within niosomes with the aim of preventing it from metabolic degradation and improve the bioavailability by reducing the particle size to <200nm. It is evident from the literature that delivery of bioactive compounds is enhanced by reducing the particle size [18]. Niosomes are commonly prepared using techniques such as thin film hydration, ether injection, reverse phase evaporation or sonication. However, the first three methods are time consuming and utilize organic solvents. The sonication method is simple, efficient and highly economic, and could be convincingly referred as green technology since it does not utilize organic solvents and avoid expensive instruments. Lauryl, myristyl, cetyl or stearyl alcohol were used as stabilizer for the preparation of niosomes in accordance with the previous studies, which reported that the stability of niosomes can also improve through utilization of fatty alcohols [8,19] instead of cholesterol. The optimization process involved the selection of appropriate fatty alcohol and the ratio of non-ionic surfactant and stabilizer. The optimized niosome formulation was characterized for its morphological, physico-chemical and biological properties."

2,Materials,"2.1 Materials trans-Resveratrol with a purity >98% was obtained from World-Way Biotech Inc., Changsha, China. Span 60 (S60), Tween 60 (T60), lauryl, myristyl, cetyl and stearyl alcohol were procured from TCI Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. Chennai, India. Dialysis membrane (molecular cut-off 12kDa), lipopolysaccharides (LPS, from Escherichia coli 0111:B4) and 2′,7′dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. RAW264.7 cell line was obtained from National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH7.4) were procured from Invitrogen, USA. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was procured from HiMedia, Mumbai, India. All other chemicals used were of analytical or HPLC grade. Double distilled water from Milli-Q system was used, wherever necessary."
3,Preparation of niosomes,"2.2 Preparation of niosomes Resveratrol niosomes (R-niosomes) were prepared by adopting the sonication method reported by Khan et al. [20] with suitable modifications. In the following method of niosome preparation, Span 60 represents the surfactant and a fatty alcohol (lauryl/myristyl/cetyl or stearyl alcohol) represents the stabilizer. As shown in the Table 1 , R-niosomes were prepared using surfactant and stabilizer in four different molar ratios i.e. 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5 and 1:2. The amount of Tween 60 and resveratrol addition was kept constant in all formulations. In every experiment, accurately weighed 1.25mM of the surfactant and suitable concentration of the stabilizer as per the above mentioned ratio were placed in a beaker containing 100mL of water with 0.2mL of Tween 60 and 75mg of resveratrol. The contents in the beaker were subjected to sonication at 40% amplitude for 15min in 8s on and 3s off pulse mode using probe sonicator (Vibra cell, VCX 750, Sonics & Materials Inc., Connecticut, USA). The blank niosomes (B-niosomes) were prepared by the same method but without incorporation of resveratrol."
4,"Particle size, polydispersity index and zeta potential","2.3 Particle size, polydispersity index and zeta potential Particle size (z-average size) and polydispersity index (PDI) were measured by dynamic light scattering technique in a particle size analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). All the samples were measured thrice at 25°C and at back scattering angle of 173°. The zeta potential of the niosomal formulations was measured by phase analysis light scattering method using the Zetasizer (Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). The measurements for each sample were done in triplicate."
5,Entrapment efficiency,"2.4 Entrapment efficiency The unentrapped resveratrol present in the niosome formulations was separated by dialysis technique by adopting the method from Pando et al. [8]. Three milliliter of the niosomes formulation was placed in a dialysis bag, clipped at both ends and was dialyzed against 500mL of doubled distilled water for 3h at 500rpm using a magnetic stirrer. Later, an aliquot of 3mL was withdrawn from dialysate medium and the OD was measured at 306nm using UV–Vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The concentration of resveratrol present in the samples was calculated using the calibration curve constructed in the range of 1–6μg/mL (R2 =0.998). The encapsulation efficiency was calculated using Eq. (1). (1) Encapsulation efficiency % = R T − R F / R T × 100 where, RT is total amount of resveratrol and RF is resveratrol unentrapped. Further, the nanovesicles remaining in the dialysis bag after dialysis were destabilized and ruptured using methanol and the resveratrol extracted was determined by the above mentioned spectrophotometric method."
6,Morphological characterization,"2.5 Morphological characterization The surface morphology of the niosomes was observed using FESEM (Zeiss SUPRA 55-VP JSM with patented GEMINI column technology, Carl Zeiss NTS GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany). Prior to analysis, the samples were coated with a thin film of gold-palladium (80:20) in single cycle under vacuum condition using Q150T Turbo, pumped with a top-of-the-range sputter coater (Quorum Technologies Ltd., Laughton, Sussex, UK). Morphological features were observed at 5Kv and aperture size 30μm. The niosomal formulations were also observed through HRTEM-JEM2100 transmission electron microscope (Japan Electron Optics Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan). A drop of the niosomal formulation was placed on a carbon-coated copper grid, and the excess sample was removed with filter paper. Later, a drop of 1% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid solution was applied on the carbon grid and left to stand for 2min. Once the excess staining agent was removed with filter paper, the sample was air-dried and observed using the microscope."
7,Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),"2.6 Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) The niosomal formulation was freeze-dried in a lyophilizer (Alpha 1-2 LDplus, Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany) to powder form. A small amount of powered sample was properly grounded with potassium bromide and pressed to obtain pellets. The FTIR spectrum was recorded in a FTIR spectrophotometer (FTIR 6300, JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) at a resolution of 4cm−1 and 16 scans in the wavenumber region of 4000–400cm−1. The FTIR spectrum was recorded for all excipients used in the formulations."
8,Differential scanning calorimetry,"2.7 Differential scanning calorimetry The thermal properties of weighed samples (3mg) of the Span 60, fatty alcohol, resveratrol and freeze-dried niosomes (B- and R-niosomes) were determined using the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC 6000, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The samples were sealed in aluminum crimp cells and then scanned from 30 to 300°C at a heating rate of 10°Cpermin under nitrogen with a flow rate of 20mL/min to avoid sample oxidation."
9,X-ray diffraction,"2.8 X-ray diffraction X-Ray diffraction measurements of freeze-dried niosomes powder and other excipients were carried out using X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima III, Tokyo, Japan). Monochromatic CuKα1 radiation (1.5406Å) was the X-ray source, with an accelerated voltage of 40kV and current of 40mA. All the samples were scanned at room temperature at a scanning rate of 4°/min in the 2θ range of 10° to 80°."
10,In vitro release of resveratrol,"2.9 In vitro release of resveratrol The release studies for niosomes were carried out using dialysis membrane bag following the method of Tavano et al. [9] with minor modifications. Dialysis bag containing 5mL of R-niosomal formulation was placed in 150mL of solution maintained at pH1.2 using 0.1N HCL for 2h and later in phosphate buffer solution with a pH7.4 for 10h, simulating the gastric and intestinal conditions, respectively. The buffer solution was maintained at 37°C under gentle stirring. In addition, the release studies were also conducted for free resveratrol under the same conditions and used as reference. Resveratrol was diluted in a solution containing 12% (v/v) of ethanol in order to maintain the sink conditions. The dialysate aliquots were withdrawn at predetermined intervals and the same amount of fresh solution was added to the medium. The resveratrol concentration in the samples was analyzed spectrophotometrically at 306nm (UV-2600, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan)."
11,Antioxidant activity,"2.10 Antioxidant activity The free radical scavenging activity of pure resveratrol and R-niosomes was assayed by the relatively stable free radical DPPH method reported by Zou et al. [21]. Exactly 0.4mL of sample in the concentration range of 25–100μg/mL was added to 2mL of anhydrous ethanol and was vigorously mixed for 3min. Later, 1.6mL of DPPH solution was added (60μg/mL), and the redox reaction was allowed to carry on in dark at room temperature for 30min. The bleaching of DPPH radical was estimated at 517nm using the UV–Vis spectrophotometer. The control solution contained same amount of B-niosomes and DPPH radical, whereas the blank solution contained same amount of B-niosomes in 3.6mL of anhydrous ethanol. The DPPH radical scavenging activity was calculated using Eq. (2) (2) Radical scavenging activity % = A − B / A − C × 100 where, ‘A’ is the absorbance of control after reaction, ‘B’ is the absorbance of samples after the reaction and ‘C’ is the absorbance of the blank solution."
12,Cell viability assay,"2.11 Cell viability assay Biocompatibility of niosomes was studied by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in RAW264.7 murine macrophages [22]. The cells were seeded in 96-well micro titer plates at a density of 104 cells/well in DMEM, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Test samples were prepared as follows: free resveratrol stock solution was prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 10mg/mL and diluted to different concentrations (5, 10, 20 and 40μM) using PBS. The final concentration of DMSO was <0.1% in order to avoid toxicity to the cells. R-Niosomes consisting resveratrol concentrations (5–40μM) similar to that of free resveratrol were tested. The B-niosomes in a quantity similar to R-niosomes were taken for comparison and untreated cells were taken as control. All the test samples mixed with culture medium were added to the wells containing macrophage cells and incubated for a period of 24h. After the incubation period, 10μL of MTT reagent (5mg/mL) was added and incubated for another 4h at 37°C, 5% CO2. After incubation, 100μL of DMSO was added and the absorbance was read at 570nm in a multimode microplate reader (EnSpire, PerkinElmer, Singapore). The percentage of cell viability was calculated by using the formulae, % viability=(At / Ac)×100, where At is the absorbance of test sample and Ac is the absorbance of control."
13,Measurement of intracellular ROS generation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages,"2.12 Measurement of intracellular ROS generation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages The ROS scavenging effect of R-niosomes was investigated using DCFH-DA assay using LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages [23]. The cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 104 cells/well and incubated for 24h. After incubation, the cells were treated with free resveratrol and R-niosomes at a concentration of 40μM of resveratrol, and B-niosomes in the presence of LPS (1μg/mL) at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24h. The untreated cells were used as control, while cells stimulated with LPS (1μg/mL) served as negative control. After incubation with samples, the spent media was removed and the cells were washed with PBS. 10μM of DCFH-DA was added to the cells and incubated at 37°C for 30min followed by washing with PBS. Later, the fluorescence developed by the addition of DCFH-DA was captured at 20× magnification using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Ti-E, Japan). The fluorescence produced was due to the intracellular production of DCF caused by the oxidation of DCFH by ROS. The intensity of fluorescence thus is related to the level of ROS. The fold increase of ROS (fluorescence) in cell lines activated with LPS and further treated with resveratrol, and B- and R-niosomes was compared with the control."
14,Data analyses,"2.13 Data analyses All experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and the results were summarized as mean values±standard deviation. The experimental data on particle size, PDI values, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, in vitro release and antioxidant activity were subjected to one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA using SPSS 15.0 software. The level of significance was kept as 0.05. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t-test were used to determine statistical significance for the data on fluorescence for assessing ROS formation in cell lines."
15,Results and discussion,
16,Preparation of resveratrol loaded niosomes (R-niosomes),"3.1 Preparation of resveratrol loaded niosomes (R-niosomes) 3.1.1 Effect of type of fatty alcohol and concentration Niosomes were prepared using Span 60 as surfactant and fatty alcohol (lauryl, myristyl, cetyl or stearyl) as stabilizer in ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5 and 1:2. It was found from the previous studies that the addition of Tween 60 is required to form smaller vesicle size and higher entrapment efficiency [24]. Accordingly, all the formulations also contained Tween 60 @ 2mL/L. The inclusion of a cholesterol as stabilizer at a marginal level influenced the membrane properties such as fluidity and permeability, and abolished gel to liquid phase transition [6]. However, utilization of fatty alcohols as a stabilizer was also reported to exhibit a common release pattern as cholesterol and the formation of stable niosomes could be achieved by altering the membrane constituents and their concentration [19]. Manosroi et al. [7] reported that although bilayer vesicles could be prepared with non-ionic surfactants with intercalation of cholesterol in vesicular membrane, the obtained vesicles were deformable which may be due to the weak hydrophobic interactions. On the other hand, fatty alcohol can arrange itself parallel to the alkyl chain of surfactant, Span 60, due to structural symmetry and form coherent bonding between them resulting in stable vesicles. Ali et al. [25] reported that alkyl chain length and symmetry were important to enhance bilayer loading capacity. Therefore, fatty alcohols such as lauryl (C12), myristyl (C14), cetyl (C16) and stearyl (C18) alcohol were chosen as stabilizer in order to select a suitable fatty alcohol for stabilization of membrane. Different concentration ratios of Span 60 and fatty alcohol (1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5 and 1:2) were also tested to optimize the level of concentration of stabilizer needed for the niosomes preparation. In this study, the contents were subjected to sonication to prepare the B-niosomes and R-niosomes. The utrasonic waves generate cavitation bubbles in the solution containing surfactant and stabilizer. These bubbles oscillate nonlinearly and eventually collapse generating high temperature, pressure and shock waves [26], which may possibly provide the energy required for the formation of nano size niosome vesicles. The R-niosomes thus prepared were measured for particle size, PDI, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency and the data is shown in Table 1. Physico-chemical properties of nanocarriers such as size, charge and hydrophobicity are important in absorption, distribution and metabolism of delivered bioactive molecule [18]. It was observed that the particle size of R-niosomes significantly increased from 77±1.4 to 503±12.7nm with the increase in chain length of a fatty alcohol at all the concentrations studied, indicating that niosomes vesicle diameter was mainly governed by the chain length of fatty alcohol. It is very essential to comprehend the mechanism by which fatty alcohol is inserted into the vesicles. A fatty alcohol along with the Span 60 forms vesicles with their hydrophilic head towards the aqueous surface and hydrophobic tail lined up towards center of the vesicle. Hence, an increase in alkyl chain length would possibly increase the volume of the vesicle and thus, particle size. Increase in chain length also increased the hydrophobicity of fatty alcohol, contributing to lower HLB and higher CPP (critical packing parameter), which could increase the particle size [27]. Shi et al. [28] revealed that alkyl chain length of lipid particle predominantly influenced the particle size and our results agree with them. For all the fatty alcohols tested, the particle size increased significantly (p<0.05) with increase in their concentration. This increase in vesicle size might be attributed to 1) the incorporation of higher amount of stabilizer molecules in the vesicles or 2) aggregation of niosomes, which occurred on destabilization of vesicle membrane by incorporation of disproportionate amount of stabilizer molecules. Similar results were observed by Pandita et al. [29], who reported that particle size increased with increasing in viscosity, which occurred by increased stabilizer or lipid content. The lower fatty alcohols namely lauryl and myristyl at all the concentration and cetyl alcohol at lower concentration (1:0.5 and 1:1) produced niosomes with particle size below 200nm; whereas stearyl alcohol resulted in large sized particles (>200nm) at all concentrations. The particles of size 100–200nm can escape the systemic clearance by Kupper cells and remains in blood circulation for longer time [30] and thus may enhance the bioavailability of resveratrol. The polydispersity index (PDI) signifies the size distribution of the R-niosome vesicles in the system. Lower PDI value indicates the narrow size distribution and thus, increased homogeneity of the niosome vesicle suspension. PDI values, in general, increased (p<0.05) with increasing chain length at all concentrations, and this phenomenon could be ascribed to the hydrophobicity of the system, which increased with increase in chain length of the fatty alcohols. The increased hydrophobicity could lead to disproportionate distribution of niosome vesicles in the system. Bayindir and Yuksel [31] revealed that PDI values of niosomes increased from 0.26 to 0.62 with increasing hydrophobicity (HLB value). Furthermore, it was observed the PDI value increased on raising the fatty alcohol concentration signifying homogenous system could be obtained with minimum quantity of stabilizer. It is quite predictable that a homogenous suspension can be easily achieved with the lower particle size; otherwise the higher particle size could cause aggregation of nanoparticles resulting in increased size distribution. The surface charge of niosome vesicles is termed zeta potential, which is essential to prevent the vesicle flocculation and aggregation. The surface charge of niosomes was measured by estimating electrophoretic mobility of particles under applied electric field and expressed as zeta potential. A zeta potential of −30 to −60mV is considered to confer stability to the niosome system [31]. The zeta potential is in a way related to particle size. In general, niosomes are prepared with non-ionic surfactants and thus, they are not expected to possess charge. But the observed zeta potential of R-niosomes was in the range of −58.6 to −43.3, which might be credited to adsorption of hydroxyl ions onto the surface of vesicles i.e. hydroxylation of surfactants occurred when they came in contact with the aqueous media [32]. The zeta potential of vesicles decreased significantly (p<0.05) with increase in chain length of fatty alcohols, which can be correlated to their particle size as mentioned. Shi et al. [28] reported that zeta potential decreased with increase in alkyl chain length of the lipid molecule. Though a small decrease in zeta values was observed with increase in fatty alcohol concentration, the difference was not significant. The entrapment efficiency is one of the most important characteristics of nanoparticles and in the case of niosomes, it is mainly determined by the nature of surfactants [8], interaction of surfactant and stabilizer [7], properties of nutraceutical [33]. The observed entrapment efficiencies for all formulations were shown in Table 1. At 1:0.5 ratio of Span 60 and stabilizer, the higher fatty alcohols (cetyl: 81.3±2.2; stearyl: 83.4±1.3%) exhibited significantly (p<0.05) higher entrapment efficiency when compared to lower fatty alcohols such as lauryl (67.8±1.6) and myristyl (71.9±0.6) alcohol. The increase in alkyl chain might favorably accommodate the hydrophobic resveratrol molecule through hydrophobic bonds. The obtained results are in good agreement with Ali et al. [25]. In particular, cetyl alcohol (C16) might have harmoniously arranged with Span 60 (C16) molecules in a suitable molecular geometry and produced intact and thermodynamically stable vesicles, which contributed eventually to higher entrapment efficiency with cetyl alcohol. The encapsulation efficiency for lauryl alcohol was 67.8, 70.1, 74.2 and 77.8% and myristyl alcohol was 71.9, 72.1, 74.8 and 77.9%, respectively at 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5 and 1:2 ratios of concentration of surfactant and stabilizer. This observation indicates an interesting fact that, in case of lower fatty alcohols, the potentiality of forming the intact and stable vesicles increases with increasing the amount of stabilizer. In contrast, the higher fatty alcohols showed decreased entrapment values with increasing stabilizer content. This could be attributed to the fact that higher hydrophobicity of long chain fatty alcohols at higher concentrations probably resulted in the aggregation of molecules due to hydrophobic interactions without forming proper vesicles required for encapsulation. The entrapment efficiency calculated after determining the resveratrol unentrapped as well as the encapsulated resveratrol after destabilizing the nanovesicles was almost the same. For instance, the optimized formulation showed the entrapment efficiency by calculating free resveratrol and entrapped resveratrol was 82.7 and 81.3%, respectively. Based on the above observations, the formulation prepared with Span 60 and cetyl alcohol in 1:0.5 ratio was considered to be the best with respect to particle size and entrapment efficiency. It has showed 108±2.6nm particle size (Fig. 1a), −52.8±0.61mV (Fig. 1b) of zeta potential and 81.3±2.2% entrapment efficiency (Fig. 1g). Nanoparticles with <200nm are preferred because they can be best internalized by endocytosis through M-cells of the intestine [30]. Therefore, this optimized formulation was used for the preparation of niosomes for further morphological and physiochemical characterization of niosomes."
17,Morphological and physico-chemical characterization of R-niosomes,"3.2 Morphological and physico-chemical characterization of R-niosomes 3.2.1 Morphological characterization The particle size of the niosomes analyzed through DLS is shown in Fig. 1a, where the average size of R-niosomes vesicles was observed to be 108nm with narrow particle size distribution. The zeta potential of niosomes vesicles was −52.8mV, which was shown by a sharp and intense peak (Fig. 1b). Further, R-niosome formulation was characterized for morphological features through transmission electron microscopy and the micrographs taken at 20nm are shown in Fig. 1c, whereas the micrograph taken through scanning electron microscope is shown in Fig. 1d. The TEM and SEM morphological observations revealed that niosome vesicles were homogenous and monodispersed. Meanwhile, no apparent aggregate formation was observed among niosome vesicles. All vesicles are spherical in shape and exhibited smooth surface with their mean particle size below 200nm. Further, it can be observed from Fig. 1e that pure resveratrol is almost insoluble in water and accumulated at the bottom of the tube, whereas the R-niosomes formed a homogenous and clear suspension (Fig. 1f) when dispersed in water indicating that aqueous solubility of resveratrol improved considerably through nanoencapsulation. 3.2.2 FTIR analysis FTIR spectra analysis was done to assess the molecular interactions and complexes occurring during the formation of niosomes. The spectra of all the excipients namely, Span 60, cetyl alcohol and resveratrol as well as R-niosomes and B-niosomes were shown in Fig. 2(A). Span 60 (Fig. 2(A)I) showed peaks at 2844, 2917 and 721cm−1, which pertained to symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching vibrations of methyl groups, and aliphatic chain, respectively. Further, functional polar groups present in Span 60 namely, CO, CCOO and COH were represented by peaks at 1738, 1179 and 1054cm−1, respectively [34]. The spectrum of cetyl alcohol (Fig. 2(A)II) clearly showed the characteristic peaks at 3330 and 1064cm−1, which was assigned to OH and CO stretching, respectively. The intense peak at 1465cm−1 was ascribed to methyl unsymmetrical bending vibrations, while the peaks at 2919 and 729cm−1 were due to methyl groups in plane vibration [35]. Free resveratrol (Fig. 2(A)III) exhibited its characteristic free OH stretching vibrations at 3237cm−1. The other characteristic peaks at 831, 966, 1151, 1383, 1443 and 1588cm−1 were attributed to OH, CCH, CO, CC and CC of benzene skeleton stretchings, respectively [36]. The peak present at 1064cm−1 in pure cetyl alcohol was observed to be shifted to 1101cm−1 in B-niosomes (Fig. 2(A)IV) and R-niosomes (Fig. 2(A)V) spectra. This shift could be due to the formation of H-bonding between primary alcohol of cetyl alcohol and hydroxyl group of Span 60 indicating formation of niosomes using Span 60 and cetyl alcohol. A similar type of interactions was reported by Sudhamani et al. [37]. The shift could also be related to decrease in the crystallization of cetyl alcohol due to its intermolecular bonding with Span 60. On the other hand, there were no considerable differences in the spectra of B-niosomes and R-niosomes expecting that R-niosomes showed more intense peak when compared to B-niosomes at 3417cm−1, which could be due to complex formation between resveratrol and the components in bilayer structure. Davidov-Pardo et al. [38] reported that the characteristic peaks of resveratrol disappeared when it was loaded in biopolymer particles. Furthermore, the absence of characteristic peaks of resveratrol in R-niosomes allows us to suggest that resveratrol was successfully entrapped in the niosome vesicles. 3.2.3 X-ray diffraction analysis The X-ray diffraction is a widely technique used to investigate the crystalline nature of a substance. The diffraction spectra of all niosome constituents, B-niosomes and R-niosomes were shown in Fig. 2(B). Pure cetyl alcohol (Fig. 2(B)II) was highly crystalline in nature and exhibited intense crystalline peaks at 20.7°, 22.1°, 24.9° and 36.4°. Free resveratrol (Fig. 2(B)III)showed numerous sharp and intense diffraction peaks at 13.3, 16.4, 19.2, 22.4, 25.3, 28.3 and 45.3°. These peaks were not observed in niosomes which indicates that crystallinity of cetyl alcohol and resveratrol was reduced to a greater extent on forming into bilayer vesicles. Zhang et al. [39] reported the similar observations. Furthermore, R-niosomes (Fig. 2(B)IV) and B-niosomes (Fig. 2(B)V) demonstrated a broad and diffused band with a minute peak at 21.4 and 21.5°, respectively depicting the amorphous nature of niosomes. These results corroborate the FTIR data, which showed a possible interaction between Span 60 and cetyl alcohol. 3.2.4 Differential scanning calorimetric analysis The thermographs for niosomes and their constituents were shown in Fig. 2(c). Span 60, cetyl alcohol and resveratrol displayed their distinctive melting points at 58.2, 50.3 and 269.8°C, respectively. These exclusive peaks of the excipients disappeared in B- and R-niosomes, indicating molecular interactions between Span 60 and cetyl alcohol possibly through hydrogen bonding as observed in the FTIR analysis discussed earlier. Such disappearance of the peaks also might be due to conversion of crystalline form of the excipient molecules into amorphous form. Further, the disappearance of the characteristic peak of resveratrol in R-niosomes confirms its entrapment into niosomes. The endothermic peaks, in general, shift or disappear due to molecular interactions or formation of new complexes. The perceived DSC results, in conjunction with the FTIR and XRD data, confirm the formation of niosomes and successful nanoencapsulation of resveratrol into the bilayered vesicles. The results are in agreement with the Isailović et al. [40], who reported that interaction between resveratrol and phospholipids occurred within the liposome vesicles."
18,In vitro resveratrol release,"3.3 In vitro resveratrol release The biological activity of any encapsulated nutraceutical would be directly related to the amount of intact nutraceutical released at the target site. The surface chemistry of the delivery system including the nature of membrane constituents, interaction between surfactant and stabilizer, interaction of surfactants with nutraceutical etc. plays an important role for the time and location of release. In some cases, the release of entrapped molecule can be deliberately controlled through the use of polymers such as alginate or chitosan [18]. In-vitro release of free and R-niosomes is given in Fig. 3 . During first two hours of the studies which was carried out in simulated gastric condition, it was observed that 30.4 and 9.1% of free and R-niosomes was released, respectively. Later, the release studies were continued up to 12h in simulated intestinal condition. The free form of resveratrol was released about 96.3% and in 7h. On the other hand, the nanoencapsulated resveratrol released 20.6, 46.8 and 80.7% in 4, 8 and 12h, respectively."
19,In vitro antioxidant activity,"3.4 In vitro antioxidant activity DPPH is a relatively stable free radical, whose activity can be scavenged through hydrogen donating ability of antioxidants. The DPPH radical scavenging abilities of free resveratrol and R-niosomes were concentration dependent, with the highest activity observed at highest resveratrol concentration. The scavenging activity of pure resveratrol was 17.1±1.3, 29.3±1.7, 54.2±2.1 and 77.6±2.3% and R-niosomes was 13.4±2.3, 24±1.4, 50.7±2.3 and 71.2±1.6% at 25, 50, 75 and 100μg/mL concentrations, respectively. No significant difference in scavenging activity was observed between free resveratrol and R-niosomes at the same concentration. This was a confirmation of the retention of biological functionality of resveratrol after its encapsulation into niosomal vesicles. Tavano et al. [9] reported that the functional antioxidant activity of co-encapsulated resveratrol and curcumin was maintained after encapsulation into niosomes."
20,MTT assay,"3.5 MTT assay The biocompatibility of nanoparticles was analyzed by MTT assay. This assay depends on the principle of reduction of MTT by the mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzyme produced in the viable cells, converting to a purple colored water insoluble formazan product, whose absorbance was estimated for measuring the percentage of cell viability. It may be seen from Fig. 4 that the increase in concentration of test samples, the cell viability decreased. The cell viability of free resveratrol was 94.6, 90.1, 82.5 and 50.43% at 5, 10, 20 and 40μM, respectively signifying that the viability of RAW264.7 macrophage cells was reduced to half at 40μM of resveratrol. In contrast, R-niosomes exhibited 78.67% of cell viability at 40μM, which indicated that cytotoxicity of resveratrol was significantly reduced through nanoencapsulation. On the other hand, B-niosomes showed 98.9, 96.2, 93.1 and 92.5% of cell viability at 5, 10, 20 and 40μM, respectively. Thus, it is very clear from the obtained results that niosome vesicles produced very low or negligible toxicity. The higher cytotoxicity of resveratrol niosomes than the B-niosomes would be attributed to the effect of resveratrol content rather than the niosome vesicle constituents. Sun et al. [22] reported that the cytotoxicity of quercetin is reduced by loading into nanolipid carrier. The results showed that the nanoencapsulation in the form of niosomes reduced the cytotoxicity of resveratrol, which might be attributed to the cetyl alcohol. Fernández-Arche et al. [41], who reported that the presence of cetyl alcohol reduced the cytotoxicity in the macrophage cell line. The obtained results indicated the high biocompatibility and less cytotoxicity of niosomes prepared with Span 60 and cetyl alcohol and thus, niosomes could be considered as safe and efficient carriers for nutraceuticals such as resveratrol."
21,Intracellular ROS assay,"3.6 Intracellular ROS assay In the present investigation, RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines were used to evaluate in vitro radical scavenging ability of free and encapsulated resveratrol as these cell lines are reported to be used for ROS generation under stimulation. Such ability of ROS generation in these cell lines will greatly facilitate to evaluate the scavenging activity of a bioactive substance. RAW 264.7 macrophages are very sensitive to LPS stimulation [42]. Macrophages represent first line of defense and produce ROS upon invasion by pathogens. In the present study, LPS, a known inflammatory activator [23], was used to induce inflammation in macrophage RAW264.7 cells by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). These cell lines were used to assess the ROS reducing effect elicited by resveratrol and R-niosomes. The production of intracellular ROS was measured by 2′,7′-dichloroflourescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay, in which the non-fluorescent cell-permeable compound, DCFH-DA becomes fluorescent upon oxidation by ROS. The intensity of fluorescence reflects the level of ROS. The untreated RAW264.7 cells or control (Fig. 5(A)a) exhibited less fluorescence indicating the amount ROS generated by macrophages naturally, whereas cells activated by LPS (Fig. 5(A)b) produced an elevated amount of ROS. Fig. 5(A) c, d and e represent the ROS generation in the presence of free resveratrol, B-niosomes and R-niosomes, respectively. Treatment of LPS induced cell lines with B-niosomes had no effect on the degree of fluorescence, whereas treatment of the cell lines with resveratrol and R-niosomes had considerably reduced the degree of fluorescence, the latter being more effective. Thus, it is very clear that B-niosomes did not display any ROS scavenging activity, whereas resveratrol and R-niosomes showed ROS scavenging activity. The higher degree of ROS scavenging activity observed with R-niosomes could be due to its higher degree of cell internalization. The niosome vesicle constituents i.e. Span 60 and cetyl alcohol might have contributed to increased cell permeability via synergistic effect of lipids present in the membrane of the cells. Rodenak-Kladniew et al. [43] reported that nanoencapsulated quercetin showed higher internalization than its free form. Thus, nanoencapsulation in the form of niosomes was shown to enhance the functional property of resveratrol. The intensity of fluorescence in the cell lines activated with LPS and treated with free resveratrol, and B- and R-niosomes, was compared to that of control whose fluorescence is taken as 1 and the data is shown in Fig. 5(B). The fold increase in fluorescence in cell lines treated with LPS, LPS+free resveratrol, LPS+B-niosomes and LPS+R-niosomes was 11.9, 7, 11.3 and 1.3, respectively. The results corroborate the above observations of fluorescence."
22,Conclusion,"The present investigation demonstrated the successful formation of resveratrol entrapped niosomes using Span 60 and stabilized with fatty alcohols. Of all the fatty alcohols tested, cetyl alcohol was most effective. The resveratrol niosomes thus prepared demonstrated the antioxidant property and increased bioavailability through slow and sustained release under simulated GI conditions. Nanoencapsulation of resveratrol also has improved its biocompatibility and increased ROS scavenging activity in cell lines. Such niosomes have a tremendous potential as delivery vehicles of bioactives in food and pharmaceutical sector."
