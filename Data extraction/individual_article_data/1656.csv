0,Introduction,"Recently, the increasing industrialization and the growth in population has resulted in significant increase of the energy consumption, fast depletion of the fossil fuels and enormous generation of wastes and greenhouse gases. Besides the strict monitoring and control of the type and amount of the pollutants and the development of adequate legislation, based on the worldwide conventions for environmental protection, a new approach for effective management of the wastes is also needed [1]. This could be achieved by a significant progress in the alternative fuels and technologies with minimum and even zero waste production as well as by the development of economically feasible methods for waste elimination, in particular, valorization of wastes by producing high-tech materials. Hydrogen economy is among the most important initiatives for many countries which could minimize the air pollution and the related global warming [2,3]. Water and hydrocarbons are considered as the most suitable carriers for safety production and storage of hydrogen [4]. Here, methanol gains a significant interest due to the high H/C ratio and the possibility to be produced by well-developed technologies from various, including renewable sources [5,6]. Despite the number of procedures recognized for hydrogen release from methanol, the methanol decomposition is mentioned as the most simple and cost-effective method due to the absence of any additional reactants and the possibility for recovering of the needed energy by burning of the released CO [7–14]. Activated carbon (AC) is a typical example of waste valorization and the scientific efforts in this aspect have been summarized in a great number of valuable reviews [15–25]. Due to the high surface area, well developed porous texture, tunable surface functionality, promising thermal stability, resistance towards acidic and basic medium and simple recovery, activated carbons provide significant advantages as catalyst supports [24–26]. It has been widely reported that several catalytic processes, such as Fischer-Tropsh synthesis [27], release of organic pollutants in air and water [28–31], biodiesel production [32], hydrodeoxygenation of phenol [33,34], ammonia decomposition [35], etc. could be successfully carried out in the presence of activated carbon based catalysts. However, only few papers were focused on the application of the latter for hydrogen production via methane reforming or decomposition [36–39] and water splitting [40]. The interaction of methanol molecule with Ni, Cu or Ag supported activated carbon was discussed in Ref. [41]. The need of production of cheap and efficient catalysts requires the usage not only of low cost supports but also the replacement of the expensive noble metals by transition metals based active substances. The main disadvantage of the latter is their significantly lower catalytic activity but nanosized bi-metallic materials provide promising solution of this problem. Spinel MFe2O4 ferrites are multi component metal oxides which possess unique catalytic properties due to the different combination and distribution of Fe3+ and various metal M2+ ions in a face centered cubic lattice of oxygen ions [42–44]. Nanoparticles of spinel ferrites have great potential for catalytic degradation of organic/inorganic pollutants [45], water gas shift reaction [46], ozonation of various contaminants [47] and as catalyst supports for wide range of reactions as well [48]. Nickel-zinc (NiZn) mixed ferrites have general formula (Znx 2+Fe1-x 3+)[Ni1-x 2+Fe1+x 3+])O4, where parenthesis and square brackets designate the tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) sites, respectively, and x indicates the degree of inversion. Zn and Ni ions preferably occupy the A and B sites respectively, while Fe3+ ions are distributed over both sites depending on the Ni and Zn content [49–51]. Despite the great number of publications mainly related to the preparation, characterization and application of bulk spinel ferrites, only few reports of ferrite - activated carbon composites have been reported [52,53]. Recently, we demonstrated the potential of ZnFe2O4 modified activated carbons, obtained from agriculture residues [54,55] and spent motor oils [56], as catalysts for methanol decomposition. This study is focused on the control of the catalyst design via partial or full substitution of Zn2+ ions by Ni2+ ones in the ZnFe2O4 spinel lattice. Peach stones from canning industry or by-products from the pyrolysis of low rank coals, both of them widely available in the Balkan countries, are used as AC precursors. The peculiarities of the formation of the active spinel phase on the AC support were discussed in detail on the base of a complex of XRD, N2 physisorption, HRTEM, TPR-TG, Moessbauer and FTIR spectroscopies investigation techniques and by using analogous NiZn ferrite modifications of KIT-6 mesoporous silica as reference samples."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The activated carbon denoted as ACN was prepared from a mixture of coal tar pitch and furfural (50:50 wt%) by treatment with concentrated HNO3. Then, the obtained solid product was heated at 873 K (10 K.min−1) under nitrogen atmosphere for 30 min. The carbonized material was further submitted to steam activation at 1073 K for 1 h. The activated carbon denoted as ACP was produced from peach stones by carbonization in nitrogen atmosphere at 823 K (10 K.min−1) for 30 min. The obtained carbonizate was activated with water vapor at 1023 K for 1 h. Thus obtained activated carbons were modified by 3-fold incipient wetness impregnation with methanol solutions of Fe(NO3)3·9H2О, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and/or Ni(NO3)2·6H2O in appropriate ratio. After each impregnation step, the samples were dried at room temperature for 24 h and then, treated in vacuum at 323 K for 2 h. The metal precursor was decomposed in nitrogen at 773 K for 2 h. The metal content in the samples was 8%, the Fe/(Zn+Ni) molar ratio was 2 and the Zn/(Zn+Ni) molar ratio varied as follows: 0; 0.2; 0.8 or 1. Analogues modifications were prepared using mesoporous KIT-6 silica [57]. The modifications were denoted as NixZn1-xFe2O4/S, where S was the type of carbon or silica support used."
3,Methods of investigation,"2.2 Methods of investigation The texture of parent carbon and silica supports and their modifications was studied by low-temperature nitrogen adsorption in a Quantachrome Instruments NOVA 1200e (USA) apparatus. The specific surface area was determined from Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) equation, the total pore volume was obtained at a relative pressure of 0.99, the micropores volume was elucidated by the t-plot method. The mesopore size distribution was obtained by Non Localized Density Functional Theory (NLDFT) method, using proper models and the micropore size distribution was calculated by the Dubinin-Astakhov method. The amount of surface oxygen-containing acidic functional groups was determined following Boehm method [58]. In addition, the total surface acidity (mmolg−1) was measured using the temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of pyridine following the procedure described elsewhere [59]. Typically, 50 mg of the activated carbon were pretreated at 523 K for 2 h in air and further exposed overnight to pyridine adsorption within closed container. The pyridine–covered sample was subjected to TG analysis up to 873 K with a heating rated of 20 Kmin-1 in argon with flow rate of 50 cm3min-1 by using a Setaram TG 92 apparatus (SETARAM Instrumentation, France). The mass loss within the temperature range of 473–673 K was taken for the calculation of the amount of surface acidic sites per unit carbon weight [60]. The total number of basic sites was determined by titration with HCl [61]. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) study was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker AXS GmbH, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation and a LynxEye detector with constant step of 0.02° 2θ and counting time of 17.5 s per step. The mean crystallite sizes were determined by the Topas-4.2 software. The morphology, microstructure and phase composition were studied by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL JEM 2100 microscope (JEOL Ltd., Japan) at accelerated voltage of 200 kV. For the purpose the powders were dispersed in analytical grade ethanol and sonicated for 3 min. A drop of each suspension was fixed on a standard TEM copper grid, covered with amorphous carbon and dried in pure atmosphere at room temperature under atmospheric pressure. After 24 h of drying, the grids were introduced in the TEM chamber for morphological and phase analysis of the samples. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopic (FTIR) study was performed on a Bruker Vector 22 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics, Germany) at a resolution of 1 cm−1 and accumulating scans of 64 using KBr technique. The Mössbauer spectra at room (RT) and liquid nitrogen (LNT) temperature were recorded by a Wissel (Wissenschaftliche Elektronik GmbH, Germany) electromechanical spectrometer working in a constant acceleration mode. A 57Co/Rh (activity ≈ 10 mCi) source and α-Fe standard were used. The spectra were fitted using CONFIT2000 software. The Temperature Programmed Reduction/Thermo gravimetric (TPR/TG) study was performed on a Setaram TG 92 apparatus (SETARAM Instrumentation, France) in a mixture of hydrogen and argon (100 cm3min-1, volume ratio H2:Ar = 1) and heating rate of 5 Kmin-1."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The catalytic tests were carried out in a flow type fixed bed reactor (55 mg of catalyst). Methanol (1.57 kPa) was introduced into the reactor from a saturator, thermo-stated at 273 K using argon as a carrier gas (50 cm3min-1). The catalysts were tested under conditions of a temperature-programmed regime within the range of 350–770 K with a heating rate of 1 Kmin-1. On-line gas chromatographic analyses were performed on a HP 5890 apparatus equipped with flame ionization and thermo-conductivity detectors, on a PLOT Q column. Absolute calibration method and a carbon based material balance were used for the calculation of methanol conversion and the yields of various products."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of activated carbons and mesoporous silica supports,"3.1 Characterization of activated carbons and mesoporous silica supports X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pristine activated carbons (Fig. 1 a) consist of two broad diffraction peaks at about 22.4° and 43.2°, which are representative of (002) and (101) planes of almost amorphous carbon [62,63]. The slightly narrower (002) reflection for ACN indicates higher crystallinity as compared to the AC, obtained from peach stones. This could be due to the chemical character of the coal precursor where there are aromatic structures that are prone to stacking and formation of larger crystallites. According to IUPAC classification both activated carbons exhibit nitrogen physisorption isotherms of type IV (Fig. S1) with H4 hysteresis loop and high nitrogen uptake at relatively low pressure (<0.2 P/P0). This demonstrates coexistence of micro- and slit-like mesopores with average pore diameter of 2–4 nm [34]. In comparison with ACN, the activated carbon produced from peach stones possesses higher BET surface area and total pore volume developed by relatively higher portion of mesopores (Table 1 ). The nitrogen physisorption isotherms (Fig. S1) and XRD patterns (Fig. 1a, inset) of the reference KIT-6 silica support are typical of high quality mesoporous materials with ordered 3d-structure of almost uniform cylindrical mesopores with average pore diameter of 8.6 nm (Table 1). FTIR spectra of the activated carbon supports (Fig. 1b) represent broad absorption band in the range 1370–1050 cm−1, which could be attributed to superposition of CH asymmetric deformation, COC stretching, phenol OH bending, and CO stretching vibrations in carboxyl, alcohol, ester and phenol groups [64,65]. The band at 1590 cm−1is assigned to CC vibrations in aromatic structures [65], while the band at about 1720 cm−1 is due to CO stretching vibrations in ketone, aldehyde, lactone or carboxyl groups [65]. The maximum at about 670 cm−1 could be due to asymmetric out-of-plane aromatic ring stretching vibrations, and the broad band in the range 800–600 cm−1 is attributed to OH stretching vibrations [64]. In order to obtain more information for the carbon surface functionality, Boehm method and titration with HCl are performed (Table 2 ). Both activated carbons possess slightly basic surface with almost similar amount of acidic and basic groups as a result of the activation with water vapour. Presence of carboxyl, lactone, hydroxyl and carbonyl acidic groups with different distribution was observed for both activated carbons. The carbonyl groups dominate for ACN, while the other stronger acidic groups are in higher amount for ACP. To prove the registered surface acidity of the activated carbons, TPD of pyridine was performed according to the procedure in Ref. [59]. The observed weight loss in the 400–870 K region could be assigned to pyridine desorption (Fig. S2). According to the methodology described in Ref. [60], the weight loss above 473 K could be assigned to monolayer pyridine adsorption on the surface acidic functional groups. On the base of this assumption we calculated total acidity of 1.99 mmol g−1 for ACP and 1.36 mmol g−1 for ACN. In addition, the TPD profile of ACP is smoother and shifted to higher temperatures (Fig. S2). These results well correlate with the data obtained by Boehm method and confirm presence of more non-uniform acidic site distribution with higher amount of stronger ones for ACP."
7,Characterization of NixZn1-xFe2O4 modifications,"3.2 Characterization of NixZn1-xFe2O4 modifications 3.2.1 Nitrogen physisorption The changes in the activated carbons and KIT-6 texture characteristics after the modification procedure are investigated by low-temperature nitrogen physisorption (Fig. S1, Table 1). The preservation of the shape of the isotherms of the modified materials (Fig. S1) evidences absence of significant structural collapse of the supports. The observed decrease in the BET surface area and total pore volume for all modifications could be attributed to significant pores blocking due to the deposition of active phase in them. Predominant location of active species into the mesopores of ACP could be assumed on the base of the observed slight changes in the pore size distribution (Fig. S1) and the strong tendency of Vmic/Vmes ratio increase after the modification (Table 1). The more pronounced decrease in the BET surface area and total pore volume for the ACN modifications could be assigned to significant blocking of micropores within the carbon matrix (Table 1). The higher microporosity of ACN matrix could promote partial deposition of active phase on the external surface, nearby the pore openings. The non-regular changes in the Vmic/Vmes ratio for the carbon, obtained from furfural (ACN) could be assigned to re-distribution of the existing micro/mesopores as a result of carbon oxidation during the metal precursor decomposition [66]. The changes in the textural parameters of the reference KIT-6 silica modifications indicate mainly deposition of particles into the mesopores of the ordered mesoporous silica matrix (Fig. S1, Table 1). 3.2.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The XRD patterns of all AC modifications (Fig. 2 ) represent the main diffraction peaks of cubic spinel structure [67]. The average crystallite size varies between 10-19 nm and 30–50 nm for the ACP and ACN supported materials, respectively. The unit cell parameters (Table 3 ) are higher than the reported ones for pure magnetite (8.358 Å) [68], which indicate substitution by Ni2+ and Zn2+ ions in the spinel. These parameters slightly increase with the increase of Zn content in the samples, which is attributed to the bigger ionic radius of Zn2+ ions (0.82 Å) in comparison with that of Ni2+ ions (0.78 Å) [69]. Contaminants of metallic Fe, NiFe alloys and ZnO (Table 3) are also registered for all Ni-containing samples, which is in consistence with the observed deviation from the linear Vegar's low for the homogeneous spinel phase [70]. This evidences reductive changes with the loaded active phase by the influence of the carbon support, and these changes seem to be promoted in the presence of Ni. In comparison, the absence of additional reflections, attributable to metal containing phase in the XRD patterns of the reference KIT-6 modifications reveals the formation of fine grain nanoparticles (Fig. S3). Here, the preservation of the main diffraction peaks for the 3D-ordered porous structure in the low-angle region confirms the conclusion done on the base of the nitrogen physisorption measurements for the lack of structural changes with the silica support during the modification. 3.2.3 High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) The formation of ferrite phase on the activated carbon supports is confirmed by HRTEM (Fig. 3 ). The obtained d-spacing value of 1.702 Å for NiFe2O4/ACN indicates the presence of a plane (422) in NiFe2O4 (PDF 86-2267). The d-spacing of 2.533 Å for the Zn and Ni substituted materials are well fitted with the (311) plane of mixed (Ni,Zn)Fe2O4 ferrites (PDF 08-0234). Similar increase in the lattice unit cell parameter with the substitution of Zn2+ in bulk NiFe2O4 was reported in Ref. [68] The obtained interplanar distance of 2.543 Å for ZnFe2O4/ACN corresponds to (311) crystal plane of ZnFe2O4 (PDF 89-1012) The crystalline nature of the loaded phase is confirmed by Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) analyses (Fig. 3). The observed major electron diffraction rings reveal formation of pure ZnFe2O4 phase (PDF 89-1012) for ZnFe2O4/ACN and a mixture of NiFe2O4 (PDF 86-2267) and Ni3Fe alloy (PDF 38-0419) for the NiFe2O4/ACN sample. For the mixed ferrite modification, in addition with (Ni,Zn)Fe2O4 (PDF 08-0234), crystallographic lattice planes of Ni3Fe (PDF 88-1715) for Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4/ACN and a mixture of Ni3Fe alloy and ZnO (PDF 89 1397) for Ni0.2Zn0.8Fe2O4/ACN are also detected. These observations are in accordance with the XRD data (Table 3) and confirm the conclusion that the presence of Ni in the samples suppresses the formation of pure ferrite phase in the activated carbon host matrix. The metal containing particles are well observed in the bright field TEM images as dark spherical-like features and large aggregates, while the carbon matrix is visualized as set of particles of lower electron density. The particles size distribution histograms (Fig. 3) demonstrate formation of more uniform and finely dispersed particles for the single NiFe2O4 ferrite modification. Note that the Zn2+ substitution in the ferrites promotes the deposition of ferrite aggregates and this tendency is most pronounced for ZnFe2O4/ACN (Fig. 3). Here, a significant portion of particles with dav above 20 nm is detected. Such a tendency for particles size changes was also reported for the non-supported (NiZn)Fe2O4 ferrites [68]. 3.2.4 Moessbauer spectroscopy The room temperature Moessbauer spectra for all modifications are recorded and selected patterns are presented in Fig. 4 . The values of the line width (FWHM), isomer shift (IS), quadruple splitting (QS), hyperfine magnetic field (Heff) and relative weight of each component (G) are listed in Table 4 . Typically, the Moessbauer spectra of all Ni containing materials, supported on the activated carbons (Fig. 4), are well fitted with at least two hyperfine magnetic sextets and paramagnetic doublets. The sextets denoted as Sx1 and Sx2 with IS = 0.26–0.27 mm/s and IS = 0.56–0.63 together with QS ∼0 mm/s correspond to Fe3+ and Fe2.5+ ions in tetrahedral and octahedral positions within the spinel lattice, respectively [71]. The deviation of the Heff values from the reported for pure magnetite ones, combined with the lower GTh/GOh ratio and the broadening of the sextet lines indicate formation of substituted non-stoihiometric magnetite [72]. Here, Ni2+ and Zn2+ ions occupy preferably the octahedral and tetrahedral positions, respectively [73]. In consistence with the XRD (Table 3) and TEM (Fig. 3) results, the parameters of Sx3 as well as the appearance of a singlet component (sample NiFe2O4/ACN) indicate the presence of NiFe alloys [72], which relative part decreases with the increase of Zn content in the samples. In addition, significant amount of metallic α-Fe is detected for the NiFe2O4/ACP sample. The isomer shift of the doublet part in the Moessbauer spectra could be assigned to Fe3+ containing particles with superparamagnetic behaviour. In order to precise the samples composition, Moessbauer spectra under liquid nitrogen (LNT) are collected (Fig. 4, Table 3). Here, an increase in the relative weight of the sextet components attributable to spinel phase is observed. This indicates that the doublet components are partially related to relaxation processes within the very finely dispersed particles of substituted magnetite. It is not excluded that the preserved doublet part in the LNT spectra to be due to the presence of zinc ferrite which is paramagnetic down to 10 K [70,72,74]. The higher relative part of the sextet components in the room temperature Moessbauer spectra for all ACN supported modifications could be attributed to the presence of larger spinel particles and this is in consistence with the XRD data (Table 3). For comparison, all spectra of KIT-6 modifications represent only doublets, which in accordance with the XRD data belong to finely dispersed particles with superparamagnetic behavior (Table 4). 3.2.5 Temperature programmed reduction-thermogravimetric analyses (TPR-DTG) In order to obtain more information for the state of the loaded active phase and its behavior under reductive atmosphere, which is close to the conditions of the catalytic experiment, TPR-DTG investigation under hydrogen flow are performed. For proper understanding of the obtained results, the TPR-DTG profiles of the AC based modifications (Fig. 5 a) are compared to the reference KIT-6 silica based ones (Fig. 5b). The observed significant weight loss for ZnFe2O4/KIT-6 above 600 K with a maximum at about 680 K could be assigned to the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2.5+ [42]. For all Ni-containing KIT-6 modifications broadening of the main TPR-DTG effect and its shift to lower temperatures are observed. The calculated weight loss corresponds to Ni2+→Ni0 and Fe3+ → Fe2.5+ reduction transitions. The appearance of a second TPR-DTG effect above 700 K with the increase of Ni content in the samples indicates facilitated reduction of Fe2.5+ to Fe0 probably due to the activation of hydrogen molecule via “spillover” on the metallic Ni surface. As compared to the reference KIT-6 modifications, the TPR-DTG profiles of their carbon analogues exhibit two reduction effects centered at 450–500 K and 600–650 K. A continuous weight loss above 700 K is also detected. The former two effects are predominantly attributed to Ni2+→Ni0 and Fe3+ → Fe2.5+ transitions and partially to Fe0 reduction, respectively [75]. Obviously, these reductive transformations are facilitated by the carbon matrix and this is in consistence with the data reported in Ref. [76]. The TPR-DTG effects, especially in case of ACN modifications, are smaller as compared to their KIT-6 analogues, which confirm the XRD, Moessbauer and TEM data for partial reduction of the ferrite phase with the activity of carbon support even during the preparation procedure. The reduction feature above 700 K is probably due to further transformation of Fe2.5+ to metallic iron. However the observed weight loss overcomes about 1.5–3 times the expected theoretical one. Thus, gasification of the AC supports by the influence of Ni and Fe metals could be assumed at higher temperatures under hydrogen atmosphere."
8,Catalytic study,"3.3 Catalytic study In Figs. S4, a,c,e are presented the temperature dependencies of methanol conversion on various modifications. The selectivity to the most important product, carbon monoxide, which formation is strongly related to the release of hydrogen from the methanol molecule is presented in Figs. S4, b,d,f. Methane, dimethyl ether (DME) and CO2 in different proportions are detected as by-products and their distribution at 50% conversion is listed in Table 5 . Typically, the methanol conversion is initiated above 550–600 K (Fig. S4) and about 70–80% conversion is observed at 750 K. The change in the slope of the conversion curves for some of the carbon based materials above 650–670 K indicates a decrease in their catalytic activity. Taking into account the TPR-TG experiments (Fig. 5) it could be attributed to non-reversible changes both with the active phase and carbon support under the influence of the reductive reaction medium. To precise the discussion, the methanol conversion at relatively low temperature (630 K) for all samples is compared in Fig. 6 . Among the reference KIT-6 modifications, the lowest catalytic activity is detected for ZnFe2O4/KIT-6 and it regularly increases with the increase of Ni content in the samples. This indicates the important role of the most exposed to the reactant molecules Ni2+-Fe3+ redox pairs, occupying the octahedral sites in the spinel lattice. The observed relatively high selectivity to DME (Table 5), which also increases with the increase of Zn content in the samples, could be due to the activity of Lewis acidic sites, generally originating from low-coordinated metal ions [42,77]. All activated carbon modifications exhibit higher catalytic activity as compared to their KIT-6 analogues (Fig. 6), despite the lower dispersion of the active phase in them (Figs. 2 and 4, Tables 3 and 4). In accordance with the physicochemical data (Table 1) this could be provoked by the lower accessibility of the blocked in the long mesopores of KIT-6 support ferrite species. We cannot fully ignore the role of the specific surface functionality of the activated carbon support as well (Fig. 1b, Table 2). It could act as a “reservoir” of methoxide intermediates formed by the interaction of the methanol molecules with the surface CO containing groups [78]. Note, that in contrast to the KIT-6 modifications, no simple dependence of the catalytic activity on the samples composition is observed for their carbon based analogues. The XRD (Fig. 2, Table 3), Moessbauer (Fig. 4, Table 4), HRTEM (Fig. 3) and TPR-DTG (Fig. 5) analyses demonstrate that the active phase on the carbon supports represents a complex mixture of partially substituted non-stoihiometric magnetite, ZnO, metallic iron and NiFe alloys in different proportions. Obviously, the catalytic behavior of the AC based samples is a superposition of the own activity of each component. Among the single ferrite modifications, both NiFe2O4/AC ones exhibit close and even lower catalytic activity than the ZnFe2O4/AC materials, which is opposite to their KIT-6 analogues (Fig. 6). This could be provoked by the decrease in the relative part of the Ni2+-Fe3+ redox pairs in the spinel due to the formation of less active metallic phases, such as Fe and NiFe alloys (Tables 3 and 4, Fig. 3). However, an increase in the catalytic activity for all mixed NixZn1-xFe2O4/AC materials as compared to the single Ni and Zn ferrite modifications is observed and this is most pronounced for Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2/ACP. In accordance with the physicochemical data (see above), we could assume that the simultaneous formation of metal and ZnO particles during the reduction of the spinel phase promotes the catalytic activity in a synergistic mode. It probably realizes via formation of methoxide intermediates on the ZnO surface [79] and their further facile decomposition via hydrogen “spillover” over the situated in their vicinity metallic particles (Fe, NiFe alloys). The observed lower catalytic activity for most of the ACN modifications could be attributed to the lower dispersion of the active phase in them (Tables 3 and 4)."
9,Conclusion,"The formation of NixZn1-xFe2O4 phase in the activated carbon host matrix is controlled not only by the texture peculiarities, but also by the reduction activity of the carbon. The formation of more finely dispersed active phase is promoted by the increase in the Ni/Zn ratio and the existence of a significant portion of mesopores in the activated carbon. The active phase, hosted in the activated carbon, represents a complex mixture of non-stoihiometric Ni and/or Zn substituted magnetite, NiFe alloys, metallic Fe and ZnO, which composition can be additionally changed by the influences of the reaction medium. The catalytic behavior of the samples is determined by the own catalytic activity of each of the components, which could also act in a synergistic mode. The by-products from the low-rank coals treatment as well as the agriculture residues, such as peach stones, provide promising opportunity for the preparation of cheap, highly active and selective in methanol decomposition catalysts via modification with NiZn ferrites. The optimization of the catalyst formulae could be achieved by the variation in the Ni/Zn ratio of the supported ferrites and with the increase of the activated carbon mesoporosity by appropriate choice of the waste precursor."
