0,Introduction,"Biodiesel is one of the most important biofuels successfully supplied in the transportation sector. In Republic of Korea, the government law currently mandates diesel products sold in the country to contain 2% biodiesel and, if the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program starts up in 2015, the biodiesel blend rate will be gradually increased even if there is a controversy. Therefore, glycerol, which is a byproduct in the biodiesel production process via transesterification (100kg of glycerol per ton of biodiesel produced), would be abundant in the chemical market. In this regard, glycerol is a potential starting material for further chemical derivatization. A great deal of studies in science and technology has been thus conducted to valorize the surplus of glycerol. Among various glycerol transformations, hydrogenolysis to propanediols [1,2], aqueous reforming to synthesis gas [3], dehydration to acrolein [4], and etherification to polyglycerols [5] have been extensively investigated. However, few works have been reported on the catalytic conversion of glycerol into aromatic compounds. Hoang et al. [6] reported that the pore structure of the zeolite plays a significant role on the final product distribution obtained from glycerol at 400°C; among a series of zeolites, the high yield of aromatics was obtained over three-dimensional medium-pore H-ZSM-5. Also, the aromatics yield could be enhanced using a two-bed configuration with Pd/ZnO as the first bed (partial deoxygenation and hydrogenation) and H-ZSM-5 as the second bed (aromatization). Unfortunately, such a high yield could not be maintained after the time-on-stream of 2–3h. When compounds with an effective H/C ratio below 2 (e.g., 0.67 in glycerol) are used as a feed, this deactivation behavior is generally observed due to coking of the catalyst [7]. The ratio is defined as (H−2O)/C, where H, C, and O are the number of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms in the specific compound. Therefore, the dilution of glycerol with the solvent having an effective H/C ratio of 2 will lead to the increase in the combined H/C ratio of the feed and, consequently, improve catalyst stability. For conversion of biomass-derived compounds, a typical dilution medium is methanol with the effective H/C ratio of 2 [8–10]. Very recently, the conversion of methanol and glycerol to gasoline (MGTG) over H-ZSM-5 has been reported [11]. When compared to the methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) process, the MGTG process showed a similar gasoline composition at 500°C, and increasing the content of glycerol in methanol from 10% to 40% did not favor the formation of aromatics but improved the yield of oxygenate compounds. However, more detailed explanation was not made on the effect of glycerol addition on distributions of aromatic compounds. In the present work, the glycerol-to-aromatics (GTA) conversion over H-ZSM-5 is carried out using the mixture of glycerol with different dilution media, due to its high viscosity. As a preliminary test, the glycerol/water mixture is fed for aromatics production. In order to prevent several drawbacks noticed in the GTA process using an aqueous glycerol solution, four alcohol solvents such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and isobutanol are chosen for glycerol dilution, where their effective H/C ratio is all 2. Since higher alcohols are able to be converted into gasoline-range molecules like the MTG process [12–15], our attention has been paid to examining the difference in product distributions of aromatics obtained with each glycerol/alcohol mixture as feedstock. Particularly, changes in the fractions of aromatic compounds as a function of time-on-stream are investigated in catalytic runs with each feed."
1,Experimental,"The zeolite catalyst used in this work was a commercially available zeolite ZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 30 (CBV3024E), purchased from Zeolyst International. The ammonium form of ZSM-5 was transformed into proton form (H-ZSM-5) by calcination at 600°C for 3h with a heating ramp of 5°C/min. Characterization by XRD, N2 physisorption, ammonia temperature-programmed desorption, and pyridine-adsorbed infrared spectroscopy is conducted and presented in Fig. S1. Catalytic experiments were performed in a gas phase, fixed-bed reactor system (stainless steel, 10mm i.d., and 370mm in length) at atmospheric pressure, where the catalyst (2.5g) was mixed with silica bead (6.4mL) and packed in the middle between two beds of silica beads. The reaction temperature was controlled with the thermocouple located in the external wall of the reactor, in which the bed temperature was monitored. The overall reaction system includes a feed pump (Younglin Instrument, SP930D), a mass flow controller (Bronkhorst EL-Flow), a preheating section before reactor entrance (usually 310–320°C inside), a cooling zone maintained at 0°C, and a gas–liquid separator (0°C) to collect liquid products (Fig. S2). Once the catalyst bed was heated from room temperature to 400°C in N2 flow and stabilized, a liquid-phase reactant (ca. 0.04cc/min) was fed to acquire the weight-hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.8h−1 and the reactant partial pressure of 45kPa. Since the effluent taken at a certain time consists of two phases (organic at top and aqueous at bottom), n-heptane was added for complete phase separation. Then, the extracted organic phase was mixed with cyclohexane as a GC standard and analyzed on a Younglin YL6100 GC equipped with an FID detector and an HP-Innowax (50m×0.2mm×0.40μm). Assignment of GC peaks is conducted with individual authentic aromatic samples. In the aromatization of glycerol-containing mixture, liquid-phase products obtained through the gas–liquid separator typically consist of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, ethylmethylbenzene, trimethylbenzenes, 1,3-propanediol, indene, naphthalene, and methylnaphthalenes, while alkane (methane, ethane and propane), alkene (ethylene, propylene, and trans-2-butene), and oxygenated compounds with low boiling point (dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, and crotonaldehyde) are detected, which is presented in Fig. S3. Since the focus in the present work is on the variation of liquid-phase aromatic products distribution obtained from different glycerol/alcohol mixtures, the detailed discussion on the formation of the other products is not made. Through quantitative measurement of aromatic compounds, the carbon yield (Yi ) and carbon fraction (Fi ) of species i are calculated as follows: Carbon yield of species i ( Y i ) = ( mole of species i ) × ( number of carbon atom in species i ) ( mole × number of carbon atom ) of feed × 100 % Carbon fraction of species i ( F i ) = ( carbon yield of species i ) ( carbon yield of total aromatics ) × 100 % Since the GC peak corresponding to glycerol was hardly detected in the experiments, the conversion of glycerol is always close to 100% (>99.99%). Therefore, the carbon yield is approximately equivalent to the carbon selectivity of species i."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Aromatization of glycerol/water mixture,"3.1 Aromatization of glycerol/water mixture As a glycerol dilution medium, H2O is first selected. Thus, the glycerol/water mixtures with different glycerol concentrations of 25, 30, 36, 46, and 70wt.% are tested at 440°C and atmospheric pressure. Fig. 1 a shows that higher glycerol concentrations lead to fast catalyst deactivation. With the aqueous glycerol solutions of 30–70wt.%, the carbon yield of total aromatics reaches maximum around 25% at time-on-stream of ca. 5h and then decreases as the reaction proceeds, where the rate of activity decay depends upon the glycerol concentration. Such an activity trend is in good agreement with the results reported in Hoang et al. [6,16]. Though the experiment with 25wt.% glycerol/water mixture also follows the similar time-dependent behavior, the catalyst shows the carbon yield of total aromatics higher than 30% and then deactivates to a lesser extent than with other glycerol concentrations. This originates from feeding the lower amounts of glycerol for the conversion. On the other hand, the experiments conducted at 400–500°C with 30wt.% glycerol/water mixture indicate the decrease in the carbon yield of total aromatics after about 10h (Fig. 1b), where higher reaction temperatures have the positive effect on the catalyst stability due to the favorable occurrence of steam reforming that can remove coke deposited at the surface. Coke deposition is confirmed by the black color of the spent H-ZSM-5 catalysts (Fig. S4)."
4,Aromatization of glycerol/alcohol mixtures,"3.2 Aromatization of glycerol/alcohol mixtures In order to overcome the drawbacks observed using the glycerol/water mixture as a feed (i.e., low yield of total aromatics and fast deactivation), glycerol/alcohol mixtures are used for the aromatization reaction, where the alcohol is methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), isopropanol (i-PrOH) or isobutanol (i-BuOH). In the experiments, the molar ratio of glycerol to alcohol is fixed at 1/12, meaning that the combined effective H/C ratio is same as 1.90. Fig. 2 presents the carbon yield of total aromatics and carbon fractions of aromatic products obtained by the conversion at 400°C and 9h of four different glycerol/alcohol mixtures, compared to those with the glycerol/water mixture (molar ratio=1/12). First of all, all the glycerol/alcohol mixtures show the higher carbon yield of total aromatics (37–45%) than aqueous glycerol solution (ca. 17%). This strongly indicates the synergistic effect of glycerol and alcohol for the production of aromatic compounds. In case of the glycerol/MeOH feed, the major product is xylene isomers (ortho/meta/para=22.8/53.0/24.2), similar to the glycerol/water case. The next abundant product is trimethylbenzenes (TMBs) of which the amount is much higher than the one obtained from the aqueous glycerol solution (discussed later). It should also be noted that the formation of benzene is very little in both the glycerol/water and glycerol/MeOH feeds. This is supported by the fact that glycerol dehydration products, propanal and propenal, are rarely converted into benzene over H-ZSM-5 [16]. In contrast to the glycerol/MeOH feed, the very similar carbon fractions of aromatics are obtained with the mixtures of glycerol and higher alcohol, such as EtOH, i-PrOH, and i-BuOH, as a feed. The major differences between these feeds and the glycerol/MeOH mixture are that (1) toluene and xylene are formed preferentially, (2) benzene is produced in relatively higher amounts, (3) the carbon yield of TMBs is significantly reduced, and (4) the formation of other aromatics, mainly ethylbenzene (EB) and ethylmethylbenzenes (EMBs), are favorable. For comparison, the single alcohol is converted over H-ZSM-5 catalyst under the same condition as used in the aromatization of glycerol/alcohol mixtures. As shown in Fig. 3 a (time-on-stream=9–11.7h), the carbon yields of total aromatics are about 31–32% in the conversions of MeOH, EtOH, and i-PrOH, while a little higher carbon yield of 37% is observed with i-BuOH as a feed. Since these values are lower than those obtained with the corresponding glycerol/alcohol mixture by 5.8–14.4% (the biggest difference between the glycerol/MeOH mixture and MeOH), it is obvious that glycerol and alcohol have a synergistic effect on the formation of aromatic compounds. On the other hand, the carbon fraction of aromatics produced from MeOH is very different from those from EtOH, i-PrOH and i-BuOH (Fig. 3b–e). In particular, the MeOH feed mainly produces xylenes and TMBs at longer reaction times (at 35h, xylenes=ca. 44% and TMBs=ca. 28%), whereas the other alcohols are converted mainly into toluene and xylenes during the whole reaction periods (toluene=36–39% and xylenes=31–34% at ca. 15h). These results are in good agreement with the data obtained using glycerol/alcohol mixture as a feed."
5,Aromatization of glycerol/MeOH mixtures,"3.3 Aromatization of glycerol/MeOH mixtures Luo and McDonald [11] recently reported that in the conversion of MeOH and glycerol into gasoline over H-ZSM-5 the higher glycerol content disfavored the production of aromatics but favored oxygenates. However, the use of high reaction temperature (450–550°C) and high WHSV (ca. 6h−1) resulted in the formation of abundant oxygenates. In this work, the reaction temperature and WHSV are fixed at 400°C and 0.8h−1, respectively, in order to minimize the formation of gas-phase products and lower catalyst deactivation rate, where a low WHSV can make induction period prior to approach into steady state. Fig. 4 shows the time-dependent carbon yield of total aromatics and carbon fraction of aromatic products at 400°C over H-ZSM-5 using the glycerol/MeOH feed with different glycerol contents of 10.7, 19.3, 25.0, 32.4, and 48.9wt.%, where these contents are determined from the molar ratio of glycerol to MeOH such as 1/24, 1/12, 1/8.625, 1/6, and 1/3, respectively. All the glycerol/MeOH mixtures exhibit the carbon yield of total aromatics similar to or higher than 40% at short reaction times (up to 10h), which is enhanced by 10–15% than the carbon yield of 31% by MeOH aromatization. The faster catalyst deactivation is, however, observed as the glycerol content is higher (Fig. 4a). In other words, the increase of effective H/C ratio from 1.67 (48.9wt.%) to 1.96 (10.7wt.%) leads to longer catalyst life. Thus, 13.9wt.% glycerol/MeOH mixture as a feed gives the highest amount of total aromatics and the most stable catalytic activity. In case of the glycerol/MeOH mixture with the lowest glycerol content (10.7wt.%), the carbon yield of total aromatics initially increases up to 38%, then maintains at this level, and finally decreases to the yield obtained with the single MeOH. Although this result may question whether there is no big difference between the glycerol/MeOH mixture and MeOH as a feed for the aromatization reaction, a rigid distinction is seen in the carbon fraction of aromatic products. In Fig. 4b–f, the following features are commonly observed as a function of time-on-stream: (1) the fraction of xylenes is decreased slightly from 42–45% to 37–39%, (2) the formation of TMBs is doubled as the reaction proceeds than at the initial reaction time (18–23%), and (3) in contrast to TMBs, toluene (initial carbon fraction of 21–24%) is little observed at the end of the reaction (4–5%). In comparison with the MeOH feed (Fig. 3b), the last two are characteristic of glycerol aromatization because the extents in both the decrease of toluene fraction (30%→17%) and the increase of TMBs fraction (13%→28%) in MeOH aromatization for 35h are not larger than in the aromatization of glycerol/MeOH mixture. In the report of Hoang et al. [6,16], glycerol dehydration products could be transformed via aldol condensation pathway into TMBs and EMBs (categorized as others) as the major aromatic products, followed by the secondary reactions, such as dealkylation and disproportionation, on acid sites of H-ZSM-5 catalyst. They also found that in the pulse experiment with TMB a mixture of aromatics were produced including toluene and xylenes (xylenes>toluene) but not benzene, and deactivation occurred with the increase of TMB pulse number accompanied by a decrease in the amount of lighter aromatics. In this regard, our results imply that heavier C9 aromatic products are converted into light aromatics during the initial reaction periods but this transformation does not take place easily as the reaction progresses. The plausible reason would be that the amount of internal Brønsted acid sites is substantially decreased at longer reaction times whereas those of external Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites are little changed with time-on-stream (Fig. S5). Due to blockage of pore and/or active site of H-ZSM-5 by coke formed, smaller amounts of internal acid sites will be available for the aromatization reaction at longer reaction times. Therefore, the aromatics production would be diminished, since stronger Brønsted acid sites are required for the cyclization step to produce C9 aromatics [16], and also the secondary reactions would not occur favorably, meaning less transformation of C9 aromatics into lighter aromatics. This is supported by the observation that the carbon yields of total aromatics as well as the carbon fractions of xylenes and toluene are substantially decreased in all experiments with the glycerol/MeOH feed as the TMBs carbon fraction approaches close to the maximum (ca. 44–49%). It should be here noted that the conversion of glycerol was observed to be nearly 100% despite less production of total aromatics, since the initial dehydration of glycerol to propanal and propenal along with the subsequent aldol condensation occurs on H-ZSM-5’s external Brønsted acid sites which are deactivated to little extent. Another contribution of glycerol aromatization is confirmed in Fig. 4b–f: the reaction time at which the carbon fractions of xylenes and TMBs crossover each other is delayed from ca. 6 to 20h with the glycerol content decreasing from 48.9 to 10.7wt.%, respectively. In other words, TMBs are formed at a slower rate and the catalyst life becomes longer with decreasing the glycerol content. This part of the present work will offer the possibility to improve the economics of biodiesel production process based upon the transesterification of triglycerides with MeOH. Since excess MeOH is generally required for efficient biodiesel production, MeOH is always available at the plant site. Therefore, the valorization of glycerol with MeOH into aromatics will be able to get realized from our results, though further studies are necessary."
6,Aromatization of glycerol/EtOH mixtures,"3.4 Aromatization of glycerol/EtOH mixtures For comparing the results obtained with the glycerol/MeOH feed, the experiments are conducted using the glycerol/EtOH feed with different glycerol contents of 14.3, 18.2, 25.0, and 40.0wt.%, where these contents are determined from the EtOH/glycerol ratios such as 12, 9, 6, and 3, respectively. As a result, the glycerol/EtOH mixture produces more carbon yield of total aromatics (35–37%) than the single EtOH (Fig. 5 a) during the initial reaction periods, even though not as much as the difference between glycerol/MeOH mixture and MeOH. Also, the catalyst life is increased with the increase of EtOH/glycerol ratio from 3 to 12 (i.e., increase of effective H/C ratio from 1.67 to 1.90). This is same as the trend of total aromatics yield observed using the glycerol/MeOH feed with different glycerol contents (Fig. 4a). In terms of the carbon fraction of aromatic products, the glycerol/EtOH feed shows a very different time-dependent behavior from both the glycerol/MeOH mixture and single EtOH (Fig. 5b–e). A remarkable difference is the substantial increase in the carbon fraction of other aromatics including EB, EMBs, and naphthalenes, though the increases in both the fractions of xylenes and TMBs and the concomitant decrease in the toluene fraction are clearly noticed because glycerol is first converted into TMBs and subsequently dealkylated to xylenes (major) and toluene (minor), as discussed in the aromatization of glycerol/MeOH mixture. The formation of ethylated aromatics such as EB and EMBs is pronounced as a function of time-on-stream (Fig. S5), where the major contributor is EMBs. This result stems from the alkylation of aromatics with ethylene that is the dehydration product of ethanol [13,14]. Thus, as the reaction proceeds, the sum of the toluene and EMBs fractions is not changed substantially at all runs with the glycerol/EtOH feeds (initially 43–48% vs. finally 39–43%). It should be noted that the reaction time at which the carbon fractions of toluene and other aromatics crossover each other is delayed from ca. 5.5 to 20h with the glycerol content decreasing from 40.0 to 14.3wt.%, respectively. Although this is similarly observed in the aromatization of glycerol/MeOH mixture, there is the different reason that toluene is selectively produced by EtOH aromatization during the reaction period investigated in this work (Fig. 3c). The transformation of EtOH to toluene is hence considered to occur at a relatively higher rate than the alkylation with EtOH, as the EtOH/glycerol ratio is increasing up to 12. Nevertheless, heavy C9 aromatics such as TMBs and EMBs are produced in higher amounts as a function of time-on-stream, thus leading to coke formation and, consequently, initiation of activity drop in the production of aromatics from the glycerol/EtOH feed. This is very similar to the discussion made in the aromatization of the glycerol/MeOH feed, where TMBs are recognized as a primary factor in inducing such a negative effect."
7,Aromatization of glycerol/i-PrOH and glycerol/i-BuOH mixtures,"3.5 Aromatization of glycerol/i-PrOH and glycerol/i-BuOH mixtures The similarity is noticed in the carbon yield and fraction of aromatic products obtained using the glycerol mixture with EtOH, i-PrOH or i-BuOH (Fig. 2). The experiments are thus conducted with the glycerol/i-PrOH and glycerol/i-BuOH feeds with the same glycerol content of 25.0wt.%; however, the effective H/C ratio is a little different each other (1.76 in glycerol/i-PrOH and 1.70 in glycerol/i-BuOH). As shown in Fig. 6 , the reaction results obtained with both feeds are very similar. Particularly, the trend in their carbon fractions of aromatic products resembles the one observed from the glycerol/EtOH feed. The difference is that the final fraction of toluene is higher than that of other aromatics because EMBs are formed in lower amounts (Fig. S6). This clearly originates from different dehydration products of alcohols, i.e., ethylene (EtOH), propylene (i-PrOH), and butylenes (i-BuOH). It is noted here that ethylene is directly alkylated to light aromatics but the last two olefins are cracked and then alkylated to produce EB and EMBs [15]. Therefore, the smaller amounts of EB and EMBs are formed from the glycerol/i-PrOH and glycerol/i-BuOH feeds than from the glycerol/EtOH feed. Instead, the higher amounts of toluene are obtained from the first two feeds, due to selective formation of toluene from i-PrOH and i-BuOH (Fig. 3d and e). This effect holds even in case of the carbon fraction of xylenes, since both glycerol and the two alcohols can be converted into xylenes. On the other hand, the activity drop in the production of aromatics from both glycerol/i-PrOH and glycerol/i-BuOH feeds is considered to be caused by the formation heavy C9 aromatics such as TMBs and EMBs. When more diluted glycerol feeds with i-PrOH and i-BuOH are used for the aromatization reaction, the catalyst life is increased due to less production of TMBS and EMBs (not shown here)."
8,Conclusions,"To overcome the drawbacks observed in the aromatization of aqueous glycerol solution, glycerol is diluted with MeOH, EtOH, i-PrOH or i-BuOH. As a result, the total aromatics yields are enhanced and the life of H-ZSM-5 catalyst can be tuned by adjusting the glycerol content in the feed. Furthermore, the characteristic carbon fraction of aromatic products is observed with each glycerol/alcohol mixture. TMBs are preferentially produced from the glycerol/MeOH feed due to synergistic aromatization behavior of the two components, whereas the mixtures of glycerol with higher alcohols yield EB and EMBs by aid of alkylation of ethylene along with TMBs."
