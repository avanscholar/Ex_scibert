0,Introduction,"With the increasing demand for clean energy and environmental pollution caused by traditional fossil fuels, there is an urgent need for clean energy. Hydrogen is considered as a candidate for clean energy and a renewable energy carrier [1]. Huge number of energy consomption and production of harmful subtances limte the development of traditional method to produce hydrogen even thuough it can produce much number of hydrogen. In the past few decades, a large number of photocatalysts have been designed to convert solar energy into hydrogen aiming at overcoming these drawbacks mentioned above [2,3]. There are many semiconductor photocatalyst materials, such as TiO2 [4], g-C3N4 [5–8], ZnO [9], CdS [10–15], MoS2 [16,17], CuOx [18] and so on. However, the efficiency of these nanomaterials is still limited by the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs [19–22]. Therefore, the development of high performance heterojunction photocatalysts remains challenging [23–26]. The introduction of sacrificial reagent can effectively compensate for the disadvantage that the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is a semi-reaction [27–29]. At the same time, the light absorption performance of the catalyst can be enhanced since the presence of photosensitizers [30–32]. Eosin Y is a very good sensitizer [33,34]. Currently, Eosin Y has been used as a sensitizer for most catalysts to produce hydrogen. Transition metal semiconductor materials, such as oxides, sulfides and phosphides, have been widely used for electrochemical water splitting and photochemical water splitting [35–38]. Taking molybdenum-based sulfides as an example, there are many HER active sites at the edges of the particles. It has been found in recent studies that the presence of Mo vacancies or S vacancies can further reduce the overpotential of hydrogen evolution reactions [39–43]. Transition metal phosphides and sulfides, as the famous non-noble materials, have attracted extensive attention due to their low cost, excellent physical and chemical stabilities and other advantages [44]. Besides, metal sulfides such as MoS2 and MoSX has benn extensively studied in the field of hydrogen evolution due to their low superpotential conversion when hydrogen is released [45–47]. It is well known that phosphating material are efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution [48]. Because its good conductivity and quasi-metallic characteristics, phosphating materials always used as co-catalyst in the photocatalytic system to accelerate the photocatalytic hydrogen precipitation reaction [49].Therefore, MoSx or MoP has broad prospects as a hydrogen-producing photocatalyst, but the current research is relatively rare. Inspired by these efforts, this paper successfully synthesized Mo-S@Mo-P heterojunction composites by surface heterojunction engineering modification of defective Mo-S nanospheres. The defective Mo-S is rich in unsaturated Mo atoms, which provides rich active sites for photocatalytic hydrogen production. After partial phosphating of Mo-S, the nanoflower structure is more obvious. The introduction of P element replaces a small amount of S elements, forming molybdenum phosphide (Mo-P), and the Mo-S@Mo-P heterojunction was constructed on the surface. The heterojunction improves the separation efficiency of carriers, enhances the visible light response, constructs a fast electron transfer channel and reduces the resistance in the charge transfer route. The Mo-S@Mo-P interaction provides a new electronic activity center that greatly reduces the recombination of photogenerated charges and extends fluorescence lifetime. Therefore, the heterojunction photocatalyst exhibits efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation. It is believed that this work will provide new directions for the development of high performance and low cost photocatalytic hydrogen evolution materials."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of Mo-S,"2.1 Synthesis of Mo-S On the basis of the (Mo-S) nanomaterials reported by Li et al. [43], we used a simple aqueous hydrothermal method to prepare Mo-S nanomaterial. In a typical procedure, 0.35 g ammonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O), 0.76 g thiourea (H2NCSNH2) and 0.25 g PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) were added into the autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 24 h. After the reaction, the sample was washed three times with ethanol and pure water. The final sample was dried overnight at 80 °C in an oven."
3,Fabrication of the Mo-P and composite Mo-S@Mo-P,"2.2 Fabrication of the Mo-P and composite Mo-S@Mo-P The synthesis method of the Mo-P sample was as follows. First, 0.48 g sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4·2H2O) and 0.31 g sodium hypophosphite (Na2PO2H2·H2O) were mixed and grounded for a while. Next, the mixed sample was placed in a porcelain vessel and heated at 300 °C for 120 min under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. Certain amount of already prepared Mo-S was added during the synthesis process of Mo-S-P composite sample. The phosphating ratio was adjusted by changing the mass of the Mo-P precursor sodium molybdate and sodium hypophosphite. The prepared composite sample was labeled as Mo-S-P-n (n = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30). (See Table 1 ) Pure Mo-S had not been calcined. The Mo-S subjected to the same heat treatment was named as Mo-S/300. The specific synthetic route can be observed in Fig. 1 ."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The morphology and microstructure of all samples were characterized by accelerating voltage 5.0 kV field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM: JSM-6701F. JEOL) and accelerating voltage 300 kV transmission electron microscope (TEM: FEI Tecnai TF 20). The crystal structure of all samples were examined by an X-ray diffractometer (HORIBA Scientific, France), which used Cu Kα (λ = 0.15418 nm) and was operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. Samples were scanned with 2θ range from 10° to 60°. The crystal phase was determined by comparing with the reference data of international diffraction data center (JCPDs). The energy state of each element in the catalyst was tested by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS ESCALAB 250Xi.) under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the catalyst was performed on a UV-2550 (Shimadzu) spectrometer. The BaSO4 was used as a reference for baseline correction. The surface areas of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller were determined from the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, which was recorded at 77 K on a Quanta chrome Instrument (ASAP2020M). PL were acquired by a FLUOROMAX-4 spectrophotometer at room temperature."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements Photoelectrochemical measurement was performed using a standard three-electrode cell on an electrochemical analyzer (VersaStat 4–400, Advanced measurement Technology, Inc). Na2SO4 (0.2 M) aqueous solution was used as electrolyte. Transient photocurrent measurements at open circuit potential were recorded under visible light illumination. A 300 W xenon lamp was used as the light source, and a 420 nm cut filter to filters the ultraviolet light. LSV and CV were measured at room temperature with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) pattern was acquired at an open circuit potential with a frequency range which was from 1 MHz to 1 Hz and a modulation amplitude of 5 mV. Mott-Schottky's test frequency was 1000 Hz."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments 10 mg of photocatalyst powder and 10 mg EY were added into sacrificial reagent (30 mL TEOA(triethanolamine) aqueous solution (15 v/v%)). Prior to irradiation, the ultrasonic dispersion was lasted for 5 min. Before the experiment, nitrogen was used to replace the air in the system for 10 min, until all the air in the bottle was removed. A magnetic stirr er was used to keep the photocatalyst in suspension all the time. The 5 W white light multichannel photocatalytic reaction system was used as the simulated solar light source. The amount of H2 was analyzed by gas chromatography (Tianmei GC7900, TCD, 13X column, N2 as carrier). The apparent quantum efficiency (QE) was measured under a 300 W xenon lamp. The light source was transformed by using 420 nm, 450 nm, 500 nm, 550 nm, and 600 nm band-pass filters. And the output intensity was measured by a PL-MW2000 optical radiometer. The distance between the reaction bottle and the lamp source was 15 cm, and the light receiving area was as the same as the optical radiometer [19]. The QE value can be calculated according to the following formula: QE % = number of reacted electrons number of incident photons × 100 = number of electrons H 2 molecules × 2 number of incident photons"
7,Results and discussion,
8,1 XRD analysis,"3.1 1 XRD analysis The crystallinity and purity of all prepared catalysts were investigated by XRD analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 . For pure Mo-S, the diffraction peaks are located at 12.11°, 18.50°, 33.15°, 43.44° and 46.63°, corresponding to the (1 0 1), (0 1 3), (1 2 3), (1 3 3) and (2 2 5) crystal faces of Mo15S19 [43]. Consistent with the reports in literature, the results show that Mo-S nanoparticles with higher purity were prepared successfully. Prepared by the solid phase method, the crystal images contained in the pure Mo-P sample are more complex. The diffraction peaks at 14.20°, 26.04°, 29.90°, 32.10°, 33.03°, 35.90°, 36.78°, 42.65°, 45.11°, 47.16° and 49.05° can be assigned to (2 0 0), (0 0 6), (2 0 6), (1 1 3), (2 1 2), (0 1 5), (3 1 2), (1 1 7), (5 0 6), (5 1 2) and (4 1 6) crystal faces of Mo4P3 (JCPDS: No.18-846), respectively. In addition, peaks that located at 14.54°, 19.99°, 29.02°, 34.52°, 38.77°, 40.69°, 41.51° and 44.65° were observed, which correspond to Mo8P5 (JCPDS: No. 26-1274). As shown in Fig. 2(b), the diffraction peaks at 12.11°, 18.50° and 46.63° are corresponded to the (1 0 1), (0 1 3) and (2 2 5) crystal faces of Mo-S. The peaks further containing molybdenum phosphide may correspond to (0 0 6), (2 1 2), (3 1 2) crystal planes of Mo4P3 and (1 0 1), (1 1 1) crystal planes of Mo8P5, respectively, and the strength of the peak increases as the degree of phosphating increases. The Mo-P content in the composite sample increases with the phosphating degree increases, and the corresponding peak intensity shows an increase in different degrees. It is evidently seen that the characteristic diffraction peaks of Mo-S and Mo-P exist in the composite, indicating that the preparation of Mo-S-P-n (n = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30) composites was successful."
9,SEM and TEM,"3.2 SEM and TEM Fig. 3 (a) and (b) show SEM images of Mo-S and Mo-S-P-15, respectively. It can be seen that Mo-S are some small spheres with a little wrinkle. A schematic diagram shape of Mo-S is shown in the upper right corner of Fig. 3(a). The Mo-S-P composite sample was obtained by partially phosphating the Mo-S nanosphere. Fig. 3(b) is the SEM image of Mo-S-P-15. It can be seen from the image that Mo-S-P-15 still shows a spherical shape, but those wrinkles on the surface are obviously increased, and a nano flower structure is formed, In addition, the upper right corner is a schematic diagram of the nano flower. TEM was further used to analyze the structure of Mo-S-P-15. Fig. 3(c) shows the morphology of Mo-S-P-15 nanoflowers with a distinct petal structure. Corresponding HRTEM images (Fig. 3(d) and (e)) show streaks that with lattice spacing of 0.26 nm and 0.34 nm which are corresponded to (1 1 1) of Mo8P5 and (0 0 6) crystal planes of Mo4P3, respectively. The lattice spacing of Mo-S is 0.73 nm, which corresponds to the (1 0 1) crystal plane of Mo15S19. This is consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 2). The presence of Mo, S, and P elements is also founded in the EDS (Fig. 3(f)) results, indicating that the phosphating preparation to the composite sample was successfully done. Fig. 3(j) shows the element mapping of Mo-S-P-15, including the mapping images of Mo, S and P respectively. The Mo, S and P elements are evenly distributed, which further indicates that the phosphating of Mo-S is successful."
10,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"3.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy As shown in Fig. 4 , XPS test was performed to accurately determine every chemical element in Mo-S and Mo-S-P-15 nanomaterials. As shown in Fig. 4a, Mo, S, C and O elements are presented in Mo-S nanomaterials. The spectrum of the phosphatized Mo-S-P-15 nanocomposite indicates the presence of Mo, P, S, C, O and Na elements in the Mo-S-P-15 system. The C element comes from the pollution during the test. Compared to pure Mo-S, Mo-S-P-15 composite has more P and Na elements, indicating that the phosphating process of Mo-S-P-15 composite was successful, and the main source of Na in the sample comes from the residue of introduced sodium salt during the phosphating. In Fig. 4(b), the binding energy of Mo (VI) 3d5/2, Mo (VI) 3d3/2, Mo (IV) 3d5/2 and Mo (IV) 3d3/2 in Mo-S-P-15 corresponds to 232.13 eV, 234.57 eV, 227.93 eV and 231.06 eV, respectively. In addition, binding energy at 232.53 eV, 235.78 eV, 228.22 eV and 231.38 eV in Mo-S (Mo15S19) corresponds to Mo (VI) 3d5/2, Mo (VI) 3d3/2, Mo (IV) 3d5/2 and Mo (IV) 3d3/2, respectively. The appearance of Mo (VI) is attributable to the exposure of the catalyst to the atmosphere [43,50]. In Fig. 4(c), binding energy of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 in Mo-S-P-15 correspond to 162.03 eV and 160.75 eV, respectively [51]. Binding energy of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 in Mo-S correspond to 162.36 eV and 161.09 eV, respectively [52]. The characteristic peak at 168.57 eV is corresponded to SO3 2− [53]. In Fig. 4(d), the high resolution XPS spectrum of P 2p exhibits two peaks at 130.28 eV and 133.51 eV. The binding energy at the peak of 130.28 eV corresponds to the phosphide of molybdenum [54] and the peak of 133.51 eV is attributed to the phosphorus species (P2O5 or PO4 3−) [55,56]. The binding energies of various elements in Mo-S-P-15 shift with different degree relative to Mo-S, which may be explained by the fact of atomic remodeling. The interaction between Mo-S and phosphorus leads to the change on binding energy [57]."
11,Bet characterization,"3.4 Bet characterization The specific surface area (SBET) of the Mo-S and Mo-S-P-15 samples were calculated by using the N2 adsorption–desorption test at 77 K. Fig. 5 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of Mo-S and Mo-S-P-15 samples. The calculation results of specific surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter are listed in Table 2 . Both Mo-S and Mo-S-P-15 samples show the characteristics of mesoporous material and the distribution curve of the pores is shown in Fig. 5(b). It can be observed from Fig. 5(a) that they belong to the type II isotherm, which is the multi-layer adsorption isotherm [58]. This indicates that the adsorption heat in the first layer of Mo-S and Mo-S-P-15 samples is larger than their condensation heat [22]. The following formulas can express their isotherms: V a / V m a = c p / p ∗ / 1 - P / P ∗ 1 + c - 1 p / p ∗ V a is represent the adsorption amount under pressure p ; v m a is the saturated adsorption amount of the monolayen c is the adsorption constant related to the adsorption heat p*is the saturated vapor pressue of the adsorbed liquid at the adsorption temperature As can be seen from Table 2, the SBET and pore volume of Mo-S are 15 m2/g and 0.11 cm3/g. In addition, the same parameters of Mo-S-P-15 are 18 m2/g and 0.14 cm3/g. Larger SBET and pore volume in the same reaction system can provide more dynamic sites to produce higher hydrogen production kinetics. Combined with SEM result (Fig. 3(a) and (b)), it can be seen that the surface of the original Mo-S nanosphere has less folds, and the Mo-S-P-15 folds increase after phosphating, which can explain why the SBET of the Mo-S-P-15 sample increases."
12,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of catalyst,"3.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of catalyst The photocatalytic hydrogen production activities of samples were carried out in a closed reaction system under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation using 15 v/v% TEOA aqueous solution as the sacrificial reagent. As shown in Fig. 6 , pure Mo-S, Mo-S/300, Mo-S-P composite samples and pure Mo-P were used as catalyst to detect the rate of H2 production of the reaction system. When Mo-S was phosphatized, the yield of H2 was greatly improved under the same experimental conditions. Finally, the hydrogen production of the composite catalyst was determined by the phosphating degree of Mo-S. It is worth mentioning that when we compare pure Mo-S and pure Mo-P with composite samples, we found that the hydrogen production of pure Mo-S and pure Mo-P were 252.2 μmol and 135.9 μmol, respectively, which were lower than that of the excellent Mo-S-P-15 composite catalyst (551.8 μmol). These results demonstrate that proper phosphating of Mo-S is a very effective method to promote photocatalytic H2 evolution. As shown in Fig. 6(b), compared with the hydrogen production activity of MoS and MoS/300, the hydrogen productionactivity of pure MoS after treatment with high temperature is reduced. Mainly due to the loss of sulfur on the surface of MoS/300 after treatment with high temperature, resulting in less active sites [59]. High temperature phosphating can overcome this shortcoming. Fig. 6(c) shows the performance comparison of photocatalytic H2 production with different degrees of phosphating. By comparing the H2 production performance of MoS, MoP and different phosphating degree photocatalysts at 5 h, the advantages of phosphating treatment can be clearly understood (Fig. 6(d)). After Mo-S got phosphated, the hydrogen production of Mo-S-P-5 catalyst reached 327.4 μmol. By further increasing the phosphating degree of Mo-S, Mo-S-P-15 hydrogen production reached the maximum of 551.8 μmol, which indicates that the formation of Mo-S@Mo-P heterojunction can effectively promote the separation of photogenerated carriers. Thereby, the hydrogen production activity of the composite catalyst was improved. However, when the degree of phosphating was too high, hydrogen production activity began to decline, and Mo-S-P-20, Mo-S-P-25 and Mo-S-P-30 were 499.1 μmol, 475.4 μmol and 407.1 μmol, respectively. The reason for this result may be that the introduction of excessive Mo-P wouid cover active sites on the surface of Mo-S, resulting in a decrease in hydrogen production activity. The comparison results of hydrogen production by different types of catalysts are shown in Table 3 . Fig. 6(e) shows the comparison of H2 release activity of Mo-S-P-15 composite catalytic materials in TEOA aqueous solutions at different pH values. Mo-S-P-15 exhibits a certain selectivity to the reaction environment. Mo-S-P-15 has the best catalytic activity (pH = 9) in a weak alkaline environment. A mild environment is the most favorable factor for hydrogen evolution systems. Over-alkali or peracid is not conducive to the process of hydrogen evolution reaction. On the one hand, the alkalinity is so high that the content of H+ in the system is significantly reduced, which is thermodynamically unfavorable for H2 production in the reaction system [60]. On the other hand, it is mainly because the acidity increases, and the triethanolamine will be protonated, resulting in a weakening electron donation ability of triethanolamine [61]. Therefore, it is not good for the hydrogen production activity of Mo-S-P-15 in the reaction environment no matter overbased or peracid. Fig. 6(f) shows the wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiency (QE) of hydrogen, the QE of Mo-S-P-15 reached 7.10% whe the wavelength was 500 nm. Cycle stability of the photocatalyst was investigated with 10 mg of MoS and Mo-S-P-15 composite catalyst and 10 mg of EY in 15% TEOA aqueous solution (pH = 9). No sacrificial reagent was replaced during the experiment, and no photosensitizer was added. The cycle stability is great significance for the application of the catalyst. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 7 (a) that the stability test shows that the Mo-S-P-15 sample has high photocatalytic activity in the first cycle. However, hydrogen production has declined after the second cycle, which may be linked to the consumption of photosensitizers [62]. It is well known that photo-etching always exist in the photocatalytic process of metal sulfides, which is because the S2− will be oxidized into S elemental substance by the photoexcited holes that generated on the VB of the semiconductor [22]. This kind of photo-etching phenomenon could lead to the reduce in the catalyst activity. Therefore, after 4 cycles, the hydrogen evolution activity of Mo-S decreased 56.1% compared with the first cycle. However, Mo-S-P-15 composite only decreased 32.3%. This results forcefully shows that the construction of Mo-S@Mo-P heterojunction can alleviate the photo-corrosion effect in a certain degree. What was mentioned above indicates that the Mo-S-P-15 composite photocatalyst has relatively stable activity."
13,Optical performance test of photocatalyst,"3.6 Optical performance test of photocatalyst Good light absorption properties of photocatalysts are sufficient conditions to ensure efficient photocatalytic activity. The UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra of Mo-S, Mo-S-P-15 and Mo-P samples are presented in Fig. 8 (a). All photocatalysts show similar absorption in the UV–Vis-NIR (200–800 nm). Absorption in the ultraviolet and near-infrared regions means that the catalyst can achieve electronic transitions at higher or lower energy. The stronger absorption to light the photocatalyst has means the stronger probability that electrons can be transferred during the illumination, also reveals the better performance of H2 evolution [59]. As shown in the Fig. 8(a), both Mo-S and Mo-P exhibit strong optical absorption density that continue to increase as the wavelength increases, which means that the reflectance of the absorbed light becomes lower. In other words, more light absorbed by the sample is used. This may be an important reason why both pure Mo-S and Mo-P exhibit the certain photocatalytic activity. The Mo-S-P-15 sample obtained by phosphating pure Mo-S has the highest optical absorption density, which may be the reason for its enhanced hydrogen evolution activity. These factors contributing to the photocatalytic activity of H2 evolution are mainly related to the strong absorption properties of black samples. The fluorescence properties of the catalyst in EY solution were measured by steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. Electron transfer and excited state interaction between EY and Mo-S/Mo-P photocatalyst were discussed. Catalysts in the EY solution were recorded as EY-Mo-S, EY-Mo-S and EY-Mo-S-P-15, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8(b), pure EY solution produced the strongest fluorescence under excitation of 480 nm light. With the addition of Mo-S-P-15 composite, the signal is minimized, indicating that the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs is reduced [67]. When the fluorescence intensity is high, the peak value is elevated, indicating that the number of excited electrons returning to the ground state through the radiation decay is more, resulting in a higher electron recombination rate [68]. The decrease in fluorescence emission indicates definite inhibition of the electron-hole pair recombination of the catalyst [69]. Mo-S was partially phosphatized to produce Mo-P on the surface of nanoflowers, and Mo-S@Mo-P heterojunction was formed on the surface of nanoflowers. The phosphatized nanoflower structure has more boundary active sites and can more fully adsorb dye molecules on the catalyst surface. Thereby, the electron transport is greatly promoted, and the charge separation efficiency and the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity are improved. Time-resolved PL results also support this view (Fig. 8(c)). The photogenerated carrier kinetic conditions of the catalyst were separately detected by transient fluorescence. The corresponding time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) is fitted by a three-exponential decay model, and the equation is indicated in (1). (1) I t = B + ∑ i = 1 , 2 , 3 A i e - t / τ 1 I i s t h e n o r m a l i s e d e m i s s i o n int e s i t y : τ i i s r e s p e c t i v e l y d e c a y l i f e t i m e o f l u min e s c e n c e : A i i s t h e c o r r e s p o n d i n g w e i g h t f a c t o r s Calculate the formula for calculating the average life (τave) as shown in (2).

As can be obviously seen from Table 4, the average lifetime of all samples differ greatly. The average lifetimes of Mo-S and Mo-P are 0.47 ns and 0.44 ns, respectively. Compared with the EY lifetime of 0.27 ns, the average lifetime of all composites are strongly improved. In particular, the Mo-S-P-15 composite has a maximum average lifetime of 0.89 ns, which indicates that the Mo-S@Mo-P heterojunction can enhance the electron transfer on the surface of the Mo-S-P-15 composite, significantly reducing the composite of carrier and prolonging the lifetime of photogenerated charges [70,71]."
14,The photoelectrochemical characterization test,"3.7 The photoelectrochemical characterization test In order to examine the photoelectrochemical properties of pure Mo-S, Mo-P and Mo-S-P-15, the transient photocurrent was tested under visible light irradiation in 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. 9 (a), all catalysts exhibit different photocurrent responses under intermittent illumination. Photocurrent intensity of all photocatalysts increased significantly under irradiation. Clearly, transient photocurrent response of Mo-S-P-15 is the highest among all tested samples. This can also directly prove that the catalyst has the highest electron transport efficiency under light conditions, so the hydrogen production performance is high [72]. From the viewpoint of photoelectrochemistry, the following explanation can be made: For the Mo-S-P-15 photocatalyst, the photo-generated charge separation efficiency can be effectively improved due to the heterojunction constructed by Mo-S and Mo-P, and the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance can be improved. Therefore, transient photocurrent performance is the strongest. The polarization curve further determines the evolution kinetics of hydrogen evolution at high current densities on the surface of catalyst. Fig. 9(b) indicates the polarization curves of pure Mo-S, pure Mo-P and Mo-S-P-15 composite photocatalysts. Obviously, Mo-S-P-15 exhibits higher current density and lower hydrogen evolution overpotential than pure Mo-S or pure Mo-P. It indicates that the Mo-S-P-15 electrode has the highest electron transport efficiency and reveals it is a promising catalyst which used to produce H2. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the effect of in-plane heterojunctions constructed between Mo-S and Mo-P. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is a useful tool to study the release of interface charge carrier transport and transfer [73]. The radius of the Nyquist curve reflects the mass transfer rate of the charge in the interfacial reaction. A semicircular curve with a small radius indicates that the charge can be transferred faster and exhibits excellent photoelectric ability [59]. Fig. 9(c) shows the Nyquist curves of the original measurements to Mo-S, Mo-P and Mo-S-P-15 composites. Compared to MoS or MoP, it is clear that the Mo-S-P composite exhibits the smallest semi-circular intermediate frequency region [74,75]. It is indicated that the Mo-S@Mo-P in-plane heterojunction constructed by partial phosphating of Mo-S is beneficial to promote the charge transfer between faces and greatly improve the catalytic performance of the composite catalyst. The Tafel curve can be used to study the hydrogen evolution in the low current density region on the catalyst surface to understand the interaction between catalysts and the water molecules. The Tafel slope b is determined by fitting the polarization data to the Tafel equation (η = a + b log | i |, where η is the overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, and i is the current density) [69]. As shown in Fig. 9(d), the Tafel slope of Mo-S-P-15 is observed to be ~34.14 mV dec−1, which is much lower than 68.08 mV dec−1 (Mo-S) and 82.30 mV dec−1 (Mo-P). It is well known that the hydrogen evolution reaction on the surface of the catalysts has two steps of adsorption and desorption. The corresponding hydrogen evolution diagram is shown in Fig. 9(e). According to different control steps, it can be divided into Volmer step, Heyrovsky step and Tafel step. Volmer reaction is a proton adsorption step, which is also called an electrochemical step; the Heyrovsky reaction is an electrochemical desorption step, and the Tafel reaction is a complex desorption step. The relevant reactions are as follows: Tafer : H ads + H ads = H 2 Volmer: H 2 O + e - = H ads + OH - Heyorsky : H ads + H 2 O + e - = H 2 + OH - The magnitude of the Tafel slope value reflects the rate-determining step of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Tafel step is the speed control step when the Tafel slope is less than or equal to 30 mV dec−1. The Hefelovsky step is the rate-controlled step when the Tafel slope falls within the range of 40–120 mV dec−1. When the Tafel slope is greater than 120 mV dec−1, the Volmer step is the speed control step [34,69,76,77]. Generally, the HER reaction on the catalyst is affected by the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism or the Volmer-Tafel mechanism, and the relative rate of reaction of each step is controlled by the corresponding rate-determining step. In order to compare the intrinsic activity of Mo-S, Mo-P and Mo-S-P-15 catalysts, the CV curve test was performed to determine the active surface area of the catalyst and results are shown in Fig. 9(f). A contrast of the active surface area can be clearly observed by calculating, that is Mo-S-P-15 is the largest and next Mo-S, Mo-P is the smallest [76,78,79]. It indicates that the pure Mo-S partially increases the active surface area of the catalyst after partial phosphating, thus effectively improving photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Mo-S-P-15."
15,Possible photocatalytic mechanism,"3.8 Possible photocatalytic mechanism The edge position of the composite material directly affects the reduction and oxidation reactions occurring on the surface of the photocatalyst. In order to better understand the reason why the partial phosphating treatment can improve the hydrogen evolution activity of the photocatalyst, results of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and Mott-Schottky plot were taken into consideration to determine the energy band arrangement of the catalyst before and after phosphating [80]. Fig. 10 (a) and (b) show measured UPS spectra of Mo-S and Mo-S-P. The intersection of the extrapolated linear portion and the baseline high and low binding energy gives the edge of the UPS spectrum, from which it is determined that the UPS widths of Mo-S and Mo-S-P are 15.62 eV and 16.21 eV, respectively [81,82]. Then, the UPS spectral width is subtracted by the excitation energy (21.22 eV), then the VB energy (EVB) of Mo-S and Mo-S-P can calculated to be 5.60 eV and 5.01 eV, respectively. The Mott-Schottky plot is used to estimate the flat band potential (Efb) of pure Mo-S and Mo-S-P-15 composite catalysts, as shown in Fig. 10(c). For p-type semiconductors, the slope of the C−2/E curve is negative, the slope and of n-type semiconductors is positive. Relative to SCE, the Efb of the pure Mo-S and Mo-S-P-15 composite catalysts are −0.23 V and −0.53 V. Therefore, according to the meaning of the flat band potential, the conduction band potential of the catalyst can be also roughly estimated. It is well known that the conduction band potential (ECB) of an n-type semiconductor has a more negative tendency than its flat band potential, and the negative tendency is about −0.2 V or −0.1 V [77–78]. Therefore, the ECB estimates for Mo-S and Mo-S-P-15 are −0.43 V and −0.73 V versus SCE, or −0.19 V and −0.49 V versus mormal hydrogen electrode (ENHE) of. In other words, the level of the conduction band potential illustrates the level of the catalyst’s reducing ability. This indicates that the pure Mo-S still maintains a good reducing ability after partially phosphating. Considering the valence band position (EVB) of Mo-S is 5.60 eV and 5.01 eV (relative to vacuum). Accordingly, based on the relationship between vacuum energy (Eabs) and normal electrode potential (Ee), the potentials of EVB and ECB are located at 1.16 V and −0.19 V (relative to NHE), respectively, Eabs = −Ee − 4.44 [83]. Similarly, the values of EVB and ECB of Mo-S-P after partially phosphating were determined to be 0.57 eV and −0.49 eV (relative to NHE). Therefore, the energy band structure of the Mo-S and compound Mo-S-P that shown in Fig. 10(d) can be obtained, and it can be found that the reducing ability of the sample was enhanced after phosphating. It can be inferred from the results mentioned above that the reaction process of photocatalytic decomposition of hydrogen-producing in EY-sensitized Mo-S@Mo-P heterojunction system. As shown in Fig. 11 , Mo-S is a kind of nanosphere with a small amount of pleats. The Mo-S nanosphere was partially phosphatized to obtain the Mo-S-P composite sample. It can be seen that the phosphatized catalyst still exhibits a spherical shape, but wrinkles on the surface are obviously increased, and a nanoflower structure was formed, and the specific surface area is increased, which leads to the increased number of active sites. When the dye molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the Mo-S-P photocatalyst, a single excited state EY1* is first formed, and then the system is switched to form a more stable triple-excited state EY3*. EY3* is reduced and quenched to form EY-̇ that has strong reducing ability when TEOA is used as the electron donor [36,53,61]. The electrons of EY-̇ are transferred to the active surface of the Mo-S-P composite and then involved in the reduction reaction occurs on the conduction band of Mo-S-P to produce H2. At the same time, the dye molecules return to the ground state. H2 evolution experiments using EY as the main catalyst and Mo-S@Mo-P as cocatalyst was also carried out. Electrons excited by light are transferred from the valance band to the conduction band of Mo-S and Mo-P, meanwhile oxidized holes are left on the valance of both Mo-S and Mo-P. On the one hand, hydrogen is produced by the electron reduction water on the conduction band, on the other hand for the phosphorized Mo-S-P photocatalyst, electrons on the Mo-S conduction band migrate to the surface of Mo-P, which improves the electron transport efficiency. Furthermore, the formation of the Mo-S@Mo-P heterostructure significantly inhibits the recombination of photogenerated carriers and prolongs the lifetime of photogenerated charges. Due to the more fully adsorbed dye molecules on the surface of the Mo-S-P nanoflower catalyst, and the introduction of Mo-P can greatly promote the electron transport, providing more hydrogen evolution sites, thus improving the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of the composite catalyst."
16,Conclusions,"In summary, a unique Mo-S@Mo-P heterojunction was fabricated by in-situ partial phosphating Mo-S nanoflowers. The Mo-S@Mo-P nanoflowers still retains the basic nanoflowers morphology and the introduction of phosphorus enhances the light absorption ability of the composite catalyst as well as optimizes the electrons’ transfer pathway. In addition, due to the application of this partial phosphating strategy, the reduction potential of the composite catalyst is increased, thereby enhancing the reduction ability and is more favorable for the hydrogen evolution activity. Furthermore, partial phosphating to the the surface of nano-flowers has formed a Mo-S@Mo-P heterojunction, which can effectively improve the photo-generated charge separation efficiency and significantly reduce the recombination of carriers, prolong the photo-generated charges’ life, and thus improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. This simple phosphating strategy used to establish a rapid electron transfer pathway is the key to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of the composite catalyst."
