0,Introduction,"Linolenic acid has functions of maintaining lipoprotein balance, lowering the level of blood pressure, altering vascular function and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease [1,2]. Linolenic acid always presents with linoleic acid and oleic acid together in plant resources, so it remains challenges to separate it from analogues due to the similarity of polarity and molecular size. In recent years, a variety of methods have been reported to separate unsaturated analogues [3–6]. Liquid–liquid extraction was a favored method owing to large throughput, good yield and simple manipulation [7]. Some researchers reported that ionic liquids (ILs) can effectively separate unsaturated analogues by liquid–liquid extraction [8,9]. Cheong et al. [10] used ionic liquids with aromatic rings in extracting and enriching n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and indicated that a strong correlation existed between the enrichment efficiency of n-3 PUFAs and the aromatic structure of ILs. Imidazole ionic liquids had significant capability to separate unsaturated analogues, but the purity of target products can't meet market requirements. To enhance the selectivity and extraction yield, the carrier-facilitated transport was introduced for the design of novel extractants. Ag(I) could form reversible complexation with CC bonds and improve the extraction efficiency of extractants for unsaturated materials [11]. Thus, ILs dissolving carrier Ag(I) as extractant efficiently improve the selectivity and extraction yield to separate unsaturated materials by liquid–liquid extraction or liquid membrane extraction, which have been valued by many researchers [12,13]. Lu et al. [11] used AgBF4-[BMIm]BF4 liquid membrane solvent to separate methyl linolenate (C18-3) and the content of C18-3 in the stripping phase increased by about 58% compared with the absence of Ag(I). These works illustrated that the extraction ability of carrier-facilitated transport was dominant rather than ILs. However, Chiappe et al. [14] reported that solubilities of silver salts in ionic liquids were relatively low, which limited the role of Ag(I) in the extraction of unsaturated targets. In addition, ILs were expensive, which was not conducive to industrial mass production. Therefore, it is necessary to find a cheaper alternative solvent with similar properties to imidazole ionic liquids to reduce costs. Because the selectivity of the imidazole ionic liquids to the unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (UFAMEs) was based on the hydrogen bonding acidity of H atoms on the imidazole ring [8], the alternative with hydrogen bond donating properties should benefit the identification of UFAMEs. Alcohols are common materials with hydrogen bonding ability, and are cheaper than ILs. In previous studies, Kovvali et al. [15] have selected glycerol containing AgNO3 as immobilized liquid membrane for olefin/paraffin separation. The results showed that the solubility of AgNO3 in glycerol was high and the selectivity of 1-butene over n-butane as high as 850. But the viscosity of glycerol was very high (967×10-3 Pa⋅s, 298 K) [16], so its dispersibility in the vegetable oil methyl ester was poor, even if glycerol had a fair mass transfer rate separating gas mixtures. Monohydric alcohols with short chain are volatile, so we proposed dihydric alcohols as extractants instead of ILs in liquid–liquid extraction work. First, the viscosity of dihydric alcohols was much lower than that of glycerol, such as the viscosity of 1,2-propanediol and 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO) were 43.4 cP and 72.8 cP (298 K,1cP=10-3Pa⋅s) respectively [17,18]. In addition, dihydric alcohols were suitable solvents for AgBF4. And the polarity of dihydric alcohol was similar to that of the imidazolium ionic liquids which had great extraction ability on UFAMEs [11,19]. The solvent polarity was usually represented by the Reichard's dye ET(30) [20]. The E T(30) of dihydric alcohols and imidazolium ionic liquids were in the range of 51-55 [21,22], while the E T(30) of glycerol was 57.0 [20]. These indicated that the polarity of dihydric alcohol was suitable for silver salts and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). What's more, dihydric alcohols were non-toxic, odorless, low volatility, low melting point and high stability. Compared with ILs, their low prices could effectively reduce production costs. Until recently, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research on the separation of UFAMEs using dihydric alcohols were reported. In this work, the possibility of dihydric alcohols in extracting and enriching methyl linolenate was studied. A variety of dihydric alcohols with different carbon chain lengths and hydroxyl positions were investigated to examine the dependency of extraction capability on their structures. The effect of Ag(I) concentration, temperature, initial feed concentration and stripping solvents were evaluated. AgBF4-butanediol extractant regenerability and recycling times were tested. Besides, the infrared spectra method was used to analyze the interactions among FAMEs, dihydric alcohols and carrier Ag(I)."
1,Materials and Methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The FAMEs mixture was prepared from tallow seed oil by transesterification. The constituents of FAMEs mixture were analyzed by GC-FID. The composition and the content were listed in Table 1 . 1,3-Propanediol (≥98%, purity), 1,2-butanediol (1,2-BDO, ≥98%, purity), 1,3-butanediol (1,3-BDO, ≥99%, purity), 1,4-BDO (≥99%, purity), 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO, ≥98%, purity), 1,5-pentanediol (≥98%, purity), AgBF4 (≥99%, purity) and 1-hexene (≥99%, purity) were purchased from Adamas Reagent Co. Ltd. All the materials were used without further purification."
3,Method,"2.2 Method 2.2.1 Extraction procedure First, dihydric alcohol or dihydric alcohol containing AgBF4 was used as an extractant. AgBF4 could be well dissolved in dihydric alcohols used in our work. Then 0.5 ml a certain concentration of FAMEs-petroleum ether solution mixed with the equal volume extractant in a 2 ml centrifuge tube. The centrifuge tube was oscillated for 10 min using a vortex mixer and then centrifuged at 12000 r⋅min-1 for 10 min in darkness to ensure that the two phases were stratified completely. The upper liquid (the raffinate phase) was taken using a pipette and diluted with petroleum ether. The concentration of FAMEs in the raffinate phase was determined by gas chromatography (GC). And the concentration of FAMEs in the extraction phase was calculated through mass balance (Eq. (1)). The distribution ratio (D i ), extraction selectivity (S ij ), extraction yield (E i %) and purity (P i %) were calculated according to Eq. (2)–(5), respectively. (1) Concentration C i E = C i O × V O − C i R × V R V E (2) Distribution ratio D i = C i E C i R (3) Selectivity S ij = D i D j (4) Extraction yield E i = C i E V E C i O V O × 100 % (5) Purity P i = C i E ∑ C E × 100 % where C iO, C iE and C iR stood for the concentration of component i in the feedstock, extraction and raffinate phase; V O, V E and V R were the volume of the feedstock, extraction and raffinate extraction phase; ∑C E stood for the sum of the concentration of all FAMEs in the extraction phase. 2.2.2 GC analysis In this work, the concentration of UFAMEs was determined by a gas chromatograph [23]. The method was described in our previous work [11]. 2.2.3 FT-IR characterization The interactions between dihydric alcohol and FAMEs, silver ion and dihydric alcohol, and the interactions among dihydric alcohol, FAMEs and silver ion were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. The samples for FT-IR measurements were prepared by coating samples onto a KBr window. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 spectrophotometer equipped with a DTGS detector. The spectra resolution was 2 cm−1 and the scan range was from 400 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1. 2.2.4 ICP-OES determination The residuals of Ag(I) in the product was determined by ICP-OES (Optima 2100DV). The pretreatment process of microwave-assisted digestion as followed: A volume of 6 ml of HNO3 and 2 ml of HF were added to 0.5 g sample in the microwave vessel. The vessel was put into a microwave instrument for the digestion of organic substrate. The digestion condition was as follow: the power of microwave digestion instrument was 800 W, the digestion temperature and time were 200 °C and 20 min, respectively. After digestion, acid was drive off by being heated under dark conditions until only 2–3 ml sample was left. The sample was filtrated after cooling, and the vessel was cleaned several times. All filtrates were transferred into a volumetric flask of 50 ml, followed by quantification using ICP-OES."
4,Result and Discussion,
5,Molecular structure characteristics of UFAME,"3.1 Molecular structure characteristics of UFAME COSMO-RS, a widely used molecular simulation tool, was based on unimolecular quantum calculations and an alternate to structure interpolating group contribution methods [24]. In this work, the molecular geometries of the C18-1, C18-2 and C18-3 were optimized at B3LYP/6-31G(d) + LANL2DZ level in the Gaussian 09 package, and the analysis of σ-surface was performed for C18-1, C18-2 and C18-3 using COSMOthermX. The σ-profiles for C18-1, C18-2 and C18-3 were plotted in Fig. 1 . The σ-profile was a priori quantum-chemical descriptor that quantitatively represented the molecules polarity properties, hydrogen bonding ability and charge distribution based on COSMO theory [25–27]. Therefore, the σ-profile can provide a theoretical basis for selecting an appropriate extractant to extract C18-3. The whole range of screening charge density σ can be categorized into three regions: hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) region (σ < −1.0 e·nm−2), nonpolar region (−1.0 e·nm−2 < σ < 0.5 e·nm−2) and hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA) region (σ > 0.5 e·nm−2) [28]. The large peaks of C18-1, C18-2 and C18-3, which stretched from about −1.0 to 0.5 e·nm−2, belonged to the nonpolar region and had a close relation with carbon and hydrogen atoms. In this region, the greater intensity of the peak, the weaker of the molecular polarity, so C18-3 had the largest polarity. Therefore, a solvent with suitable polarity can be selected as the extractant depending on the polarity difference of FAMEs. A range greater than 0.5 e·nm−2 represented the hydrogen bond basicity of molecules, and the intensity reflected the hydrogen bond acceptor ability. The region ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 m−2 corresponded to CC bonds of UFAMEs. C18-3 had three CC bonds, so it owned largest hydrogen bond basicity compared with C18-1 and C18-2. Another region from 1.0 to 1.8 e·nm−2 corresponded to the carbonyl group of UFAMEs. The peak intensities of C18-1, C18-2 and C18-3 were similar at 1.0–1.8 e·nm−2, indicating CC bonds on the aliphatic chain of FAMEs had little effect on the hydrogen bond basicity of the carbonyl group. Combining the hydrogen bond basicity of the carbonyl group and the CC bond, it can be concluded that the hydrogen bond basicity of C18-3 was relatively highest. Therefore, oppositely, the extracting solvent should possess a suitable hydrogen bond acidity. The difference on σ-profile demonstrated that the separation of C18-3 by liquid–liquid extraction was practicable based on polarity and hydrogen bond capacity. The selected extractant should have suitable polarity and hydrogen bond donor capacity. In this paper, we proposed dihydric alcohols as extractants. Firstly, dihydric alcohols, such as ethanediol, propanediol and butanediol etc., have acted as hydrogen bond donors in many systems [29,30]. Secondly, the polarity of dihydric alcohols was similar to that of imidazolium ionic liquids, such as [Bmim]BF4, [Bmim]CF3SO3 and [Bmim]NTf2. These ionic liquids had good separation ability for unsaturated materials [11,31]. The polarity parameter E T(30) of dihydric alcohols and imidazolium ionic liquids was shown in Table 2 ."
6,Interactions between dihydric alcohol and FAMEs,"3.2 Interactions between dihydric alcohol and FAMEs The interactions between dihydric alcohol and FAMEs were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. First, an equal volume of undiluted FAMEs and 1,4-BDO were mixed by the vortex for 10 min and then centrifuged for another 10 min. The upper oil phase and the lower alcohol phase were analyzed by FT-IR respectively. The results were shown in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2, the IR spectra of FAMEs treated with 1,4-BDO were consistent with the one without being treated with 1,4-BDO, and the characteristic peaks of the BDO were not observed in the oil phase, which indicated that 1,4-BDO would not enter the oil phase and it as the extractant would not be lost. It was already known that 1743.0 cm−1 and 1638.8 cm−1 were the characteristic peaks of CO and CC bond of FAMEs respectively, and the broad peaks at 3331.9 cm−1 and 1661.0 cm−1 were assigned to the stretching and the bending vibration of hydroxyl group. Due to the peak superposition of CC bond and the bending vibration of hydroxyl group, it was difficult to judge the interaction between CC bond of UFAMEs and BDO by FT-IR. But the CO characteristic peak appeared in the alcohol phase, which confirmed that FAMEs could dissolve into BDO. What's more, the peak of CO exhibited a red shift from 1743.0 cm−1 to 1741.4 cm−1 after dissolved into BDO. At the same time, the stretching vibration of alcohol hydroxyl group was obviously broadened after treated with FAMEs. These results suggested that the hydrogen bond action existed between the alcohol hydroxyl group and the carbonyl group of FAMEs to average the electron cloud density, so absorption frequency shifted to a lower wave number segment."
7,Effect of dihydric alcohol structure on extraction,"3.3 Effect of dihydric alcohol structure on extraction The difference in dihydric alcohol molecular structure led to different physicochemical properties, such as polarity, viscosity, polarity, and steric hindrance, which would have influenced on the extraction ability. Thus, we investigated the effect of structure (carbon chain length and hydroxyl position) on the extraction of C18-3. 3.3.1 Dihydric alcohol carbon chain length Dihydric alcohols with hydroxyl group at the ends of the carbon chain were selected to investigate the effect of carbon chain length on extraction. Because the solubility of C18-3 in ethanediol was negligible, and the polarity parameter E T(30) of ethanediol was high to 56.3 [20], thus it was not suitable for extracting UFAMEs. 1,6-hexanediol was solid at room temperature. Therefore, the effects of carbon chain length on dihydric alcohol were investigated by using 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol and 1,5-pentanediol. Shown in Fig. 3 are the distribution ratios of C18-0, C18-1, C18-2 and C18-3 in the extraction solvents with the different carbon chain lengths following the order: 1,3-propanediol<1,4-butanediol<1,5-pentanediol. E C18-3 trend was the same as the distribution ratio. The E C18-3 of 1,5-pentanediol at least doubled than that of 1,4-butanediol and 1,3-propanediol. The results were in good agreement with the polarity difference between dihydric alcohol and FAMEs. Since the polarity of extraction solvent decreased with the increase of the dihydric alcohol carbon chain length, 1,5-pentanediol had the strongest affinity with FAMEs. However, the less polar extraction solvent was detrimental to the selectivity of C18-3. As could be seen in Fig. 3b, when 1,5-pentanediol was used as the extractant, the purity of C18-3 in extraction phase (16.79%) was even lower than that in the initial feed phase (37.34%), which indicated that 1,5-pentanediol had low recognition ability to C18-3 and was not a suitable extractant. As to 1,3-propanediol and 1,4-butanediol, the selectivity both higher than 1.0, and the purity of C18-3 in the extraction phase increased to above 40%, indicating that 1,3-propanediol and 1,4-butanediol were selective for C18-3. Combining the extraction yield and selectivity of these dihydric alcohols, in this paper, butanediol with moderately polar was selected as the extractant. 3.3.2 Hydroxyl position of dihydric alcohol BDO has four isomers, including 2,3-BDO, 1,2-BDO, 1,3-BDO and1,4-BDO. All of the four isomers were selected to investigate the effect of dihydric alcohol hydroxyl group position on extraction. The results were presented in Fig. 4 . As seen in Fig. 4a, the distribution ratio of C18-0, C18-1, C18-2 and C18-3 followed the order: 1,4-BDO < 1,3-BDO < 2,3-BDO < 1,2-BDO. 1,2-BDO expressed the best distribution ratio and extraction yield, E C18-3 reached the value as high as 29.32%, while E C18-3were 21.85%, 15.61% and 12.72% using 2,3-BDO, 1,3-BDO and 1,4-BDO as extractants, respectively. It was partially attributed to the fact that the polarity difference affected the affinity of dihydric alcohols with UFAMEs. However, just from the perspective of polarity, the extraction ability of 2,3-BDO should be the strongest, but in fact, the extraction ability of 2,3-BDO was not as good as 1,2-BDO, which due to the higher steric hindrance between 2,3-BDO and UFAMEs. Fig. 4b showed that C18-3 could be enriched by all isomers. In comparison, the selectivity of C18-3 obtained by 2,3-BDO and 1,2-BDO was slightly higher than that by 1,3-BDO and 1,4-BDO. And the purity was not sensitive to the hydroxyl position of dihydric alcohols in extraction, and the purity of C18-3 in the extraction phase all were about 40%."
8,The promotion of Ag(I) on C18-3 extraction,"3.4 The promotion of Ag(I) on C18-3 extraction Although dihydric alcohols have extraction and recognition ability for C18-3, the interactions between them were not strong enough, and product purity was far from the needs of the market. Over the past decade, various researchers have confirmed that transition metal ions such as Cu(I) and Ag(I) could significantly improve the extraction efficiency of UFAMEs [19,32]. In this work, four isomeric butanediols dissolving the same amount of AgBF4 were used as extractants. The experimental results were presented in Fig. 5 . By comparing Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, the extraction ability of four BDOs dissolving AgBF4 all improved effectively. The distribution ratio of each FAME was increased by several tens of times, and the S C18-3/C18-0 increased by approximately two orders of magnitude, and S C18-3/C18-1 and S C18-3/C18-2 also increased several times. Taking AgBF4/1,4-BDO extractant as an example, compared with the 1,4-BDO extractant (without AgBF4), D C18-3 and E C18-3 increased remarkably from 0.12 to 9.10, and from 12.72% to 92.32% respectively. The P C18-3 in the extraction phase increased from 40% to 66%. Furthermore, the extraction difference of isomeric BDOs was more noticeable after dissolving AgBF4. The S C18-3/C18-2 of 1,2-BDO and 1,4-BDO differed by 8.87, while the selectivity difference was only 0.1 without AgBF4. It should be noted that 1,4-BDO containing AgBF4 possessed the best extraction capability combined with extraction yield and selectivity, which was probably due to the stronger synergistic extraction effect between silver ions and 1,4-BDO. The interactions between Ag(I) and 1,4-BDO were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopies. As can be seen from Fig. 6 , upon mixing with AgBF4, a new peak appeared at 3547.1 cm−1 on the high wavenumber side of the stretching vibration hydroxyl peak, and the bending vibration hydroxyl peak exhibited a red shift from 1661.0 cm−1 to 1649.3 cm−1, which suggested the occurrence of strong interactions between silver ions and dihydric alcohol hydroxyl groups. To further investigate the interactions among Ag(I), 1,4-BDO and FAMEs, FT-IR also was used to provide valid information. First, an equal volume of undiluted FAMEs and 1,4-BDO dissolving AgBF4 were mixed by the vortex for 10 min and then centrifuged for another 10 min. The Ag(I)-alcohol phase was analyzed by FT-IR. The results were shown in Fig. 7 . As can be seen in Fig. 7a, the peak appeared on the high wavenumber side of the stretching vibration hydroxyl peak became lager with the increase of AgBF4 concentration, indicating that the interaction between Ag(I) and hydrogen bonding enhanced. In Fig. 7b, after the part of FAMEs dissolved into AgBF4/BDO phase, the characteristic peak of CO bond in the alcohol phase split into two peaks. A new peak appeared at 1738.2 cm−1, and the other peak exhibited a red shift from 1743.0 cm−1 to 1717.2 cm−1. These findings were well consistent with those of Bin et al. [32]. These phenomena resulted from the coordination between Ag(I) and O atoms of the carbonyl groups with the high negative charge density, which was beneficial to improve the solubility of FAMEs in the Ag(I)-alcohol phase. As in the case of Fig. 2, Fig. 7b also can't judge the shift of the bending vibration of hydroxyl group and CC bond due to the peak superposition. Although the interaction between Ag(I) and CC wasn't clearly shown by the infrared spectrum, our previous work has proven that Ag(I) preferentially coordinated with CC bonds, and the interaction between CC bond and Ag(I) was stronger than that between carbonyl group and Ag(I) by natural bond orbital and frontier molecular orbital analysis [11]."
9,Ag(I) concentration,"3.5 Ag(I) concentration According to the above red infrared spectrum of Ag(I), BDO and FAMEs, carrier Ag(I) had a great influence on the extraction ability. But excess Ag(I) may coordinate with other UFAMEs to reduce the recognition of C18-3. What's more, it was not conducive to the reverse extraction as the interaction between Ag(I) and UFAME is too strong. Thus, the effect of Ag(I) concentration should be investigated to choose the most appropriate Ag(I) concentration. In this work, we investigated the effects of AgBF4 concentration on the extraction of FAMEs, as shown in Fig. 8 . Fig. 8 showed the separation performance of UFAMEs under various AgBF4 concentrations. As can be seen in Fig. 8a, the distribution ratio and extraction yield of C18-3 increased along with Ag(I) concentration. As Ag(I) concentration in the extraction solvent increased from 0.0 to 0.4 g·ml−1, the DC18-3 increased markedly while the distribution ratio of C18-0, C18-1 and C18-2 increased slowly. And the selectivity of C18-3 to other substances increased sharply with the increase of Ag(I) concentration. It should be noted that the content of C18-0 and C18-1 in the raw materials was only 2.23% and 15.47%, the content of C18-2 and C18-3 in the raw materials was 33.53% and 37.34% respectively, so the purity of C18-3 was mainly determined by S C18-3/C18-2. Therefore, although S C18-3/C18-0 and S C18-3/C18-1 were high up to 133.54 and 90.30, S C18-3/C18-2 was 15.47 and the purity of C18-3 was just 66.18%. The extraction yield and selectivity still showed an upward trend, but it can be predicted that more C18-1 and C18-2 would enter the extraction phase to reduce the purity of C18-3 in the extraction phase when Ag(I) concentration continued to increase, so there was no further increase in Ag(I) concentration in our work. The above experimental results were compared with Li's paper [7] to show the performance of the silver-based dihydric alcohol extractants. Li et al. used AgBF4 (5.5 mg) dissolved in ionic liquid (1 ml) to extract C18-3 (2 mg) dissolved in hexene (1 ml), which was equivalent to ionic liquid (1 ml) dissolving 0.1375 g AgBF4 to extract 50 mg·ml−1 C18-3 hexene solution (1 ml). They reported that D C18-3 was less than 0.1 using [C2mim]BF4 and [C4mim]BF4, and D C18-3 were about 3.3 and 5.2 using [C6mim]BF4 and [C8mim]BF4 respectively. In our work, as the AgBF4 concentration was 0.1375 g·ml−1, the D C18-3 was about 0.4. Thus, the extraction capability of silver-based 1,4-BDO is better than silver-based [C2mim]BF4 and [C4mim]BF4. Although [C6mim]BF4 and [C8mim]BF4 had better extraction ratio for C18-3, the viscosity of [C6mim]BF4 (266×10-3 Pa⋅s, 293 K) and [C8mim]BF4 (415 ×10-3 Pa⋅s, 293 K) [11] was too high to have good dispersibility, so they were not suitable for extraction. In addition, Li et al. also used [C6mim]PF6 (1 ml) dissolving AgBF4 (8.2 mg) to extract UFAMEs (2 mg, including C20-5, C18-2 and C18-3) hexene solution (1 ml), and the value of S C18-3/C18-2 was about 2. In our work, the corresponding S C18-3/C18-2 was also about 2. Due to the limit of the solubility of ILs for AgBF4, the carrier Ag(I) can't continue to improve the extraction efficiency in ionic liquids [14]. BDOs have good solubility for AgBF4, the selectivity of C18-3 could still be improved by increasing Ag(I) concentration."
10,Temperature,"3.6 Temperature The effect of temperature on extraction was studied, and the results were presented in Fig. 9 . It can be seen that the D C18-3, E C18-3 and selectivity decreased significantly with the increase in temperature, and the purity of C18-3 in the extraction phase also decreased slightly. To explain the effect of temperature on the extraction, the thermodynamic parameter of the enthalpy (H°, kJ·ml−1was calculated based on the van't Hoff (Eq. 6). The enthalpy changes from the van't Hoff plot was investigated in the temperature range 20~50 °C. (6) ln D = − ∆ H R T + ∆ S R where R is the gas constant (8.314 J·mol−1·K−1); T is the extraction temperature (K). According to the fitting curve of Fig. 10 , the calculated ΔH was −57.25 kJ·mol−1, which indicated that the complexation reaction of Ag(I) with C18-3 was an exothermic process. Lower temperature is beneficial to improve the stability of the resulting complex compounds and enhanced the extraction capacity of C18-3."
11,Initial concentration of FAMEs,"3.7 Initial concentration of FAMEs The effect of initial concentration of FAMEs was investigated by undiluted FAMEs and methyl ether petroleum ether solutions (50–400 mg·ml−1). The experimental data were presented in Fig. 11 . As shown in Fig. 11a, the distribution ratio D C18-3 and E C18-3 decreased with the increase of FAMEs concentration. As the feed concentration was 50 mg·ml−1, the D C18-3 was 9.10, and the E C18-3 was 92.32%. When undiluted FAMEs used as feed phase, the DC18-3 and E C18-3 were 0.70 and 56.84%, respectively. In Fig. 11b, S C18-3/C18-0, S C18-3/C18-1 and S C18-3/C18-2 decreased by 118.6, 77.0 and 8.6 when the initial concentration increased from 50 to 400 mg·ml−1, showing significant downward trends. But the purity of C18-3 was not notably affected by the variation of feed concentration, P C18-3 kept at 60%–66 when the feed concentration at 50–400 mg·ml−1, while P C18-3 remained at 57.79% using undiluted FAMEs. C18-3 could still maintain good purity using undiluted FAMEs, so it was quite beneficial for industrial production of C18-3."
12,Reverse extraction,"3.8 Reverse extraction To obtain the C18-3 product and regenerate the extractant, C18-3 should be back extracted from the Ag(I)-alcohol phase. Firstly, choosing a suitable stripping solvent was important to ensure the extraction efficiency and selectivity of the reverse extraction. The stripping solvent should be a low polar agent with the ability to dissolve FAMEs. 1-Hexene and n-heptane were low polar solvents and had good solubility for FAMEs. And 1-hexene with CC bond can compete with C18-3 for the complexation with Ag(I) [11], so n-heptane and 1-hexene were selected as stripping solvents in this work. Besides, a multi-step reverse extraction method was proposed, and the recycling times of the extractant was also investigated. 3.8.1 Stripping solvent Due to the difference in polarity and double bond number, the solubility of 1-hexene and n-heptane for each FAME was different. In order to select a suitable stripping solvent, the effects of the ratio of 1-hexene to n-heptane on reverse extraction of C18-3 were investigated. The reverse extraction yield (Er) and the purity of C18-3 in the stripping solvent (PrC18-3) were shown in Fig. 12 . Using n-heptane as reverse extraction solvent, ErC18-3 was only 6.61%, while ErC18-0, ErC18-1 and ErC18-2 were 81.78%, 68.60% and 50.38%, respectively, showing that the solubility of C18-0, C18-1 and C18-2 in n-heptane was higher than that of C18-3. When 1-hexene was used as the stripping solvent, the E C18-3% increased by 63.69% compared with the n-heptane, which illustrated that 1-hexene was beneficial to the reverse extraction of C18-3. The purity of C18-3 in the stripping solvent increased with the increase in 1-hexene content. Compared with n-heptane, the purity of C18-3 in the 1-hexene stripping solvent increased by 46.03%. However, regardless of the ratio of 1-hexene and n-heptane, the purity of C18-3 can't meet market requirement and other UFAMEs would dissolve into the stripping solvent, so the purification of C18-3 cannot be achieved by one-stage reverse extraction. 3.8.2 Multiple-step reverse extraction By analyzing the results of n-heptane and 1-hexene as stripping solvents, it can be considered that n-heptane favored the back extraction of C18-0, C18-1 and C18-2, and 1-hexene facilitated the reverse extraction of C18-3. Based on the results, a multi-step reverse extraction method for purifying C18-3 was proposed. The total extraction and stripping process were shown in Fig. 13 . The stripping process was divided into two parts: 1) wash extraction: the extracting Ag(I)-alcohol phase was washed by n-heptane repeatedly twice to remove lower polarity FAMEs and improve the purity of C18-3 in the Ag(I)-alcohol phase; 2) purified extraction: the Ag(I)-alcohol phase was reversely extracted twice using 1-hexene to obtain C18-3. In the extraction experiment, 400 mg·ml−1 methyl ether petroleum ether solution and the equal volume of 0.5 g·ml−1 AgBF4/1,4-BDO were selected as feed solution (feed phase A) and extractant (Ag(I)-alcohol phase A) respectively. The extraction yield and content of C18-3 reached 89.84% and 61.60%, while the content of C18-0, C18-1 and C18-2 were 0.70%, 5.82% and 28.12% respectively. The C18-0, C18-1 and C18-2 should be removed to increase the C18-3 purity in the Ag(I)-alcohol phase. The Ag(I)-alcohol phase was subjected to wash extraction and purified extraction, and the results were shown in Table 3 . In the wash extraction, the Ag(I)-alcohol phase was extracted by n-heptane twice. The part of C18-0, C18-1 and C18-2 in the lower Ag(I)-alcohol phase were washed and the purity of C18-3 in the Ag(I)-alcohol phase D reached 77.42%. In the purified extraction, few C18-0 and C18-1 entered the upper hexene phase. The purity of C18-3 in the stage 1 of purified extraction (Ag(I)-alcohol phase E) and the stage 2 (Ag(I)-alcohol phase F) were high to 90.45% and 95.35%, respectively. It showed that 1-hexene had excellent selectivity to C18-3 (Table 3). Finally, the FAMEs-hexene phase A and FAMEs-hexene phase B were combined, and the 1-hexene was removed by rotary evaporation to obtain the C18-3 product. The content of C18-3 in the product was 93.36%, and the yield YC18-3 was calculated by the Eq. 7 to be 73.76%. What's more, the residue of AgBF4 in the C18-3 product was determined by ICP-OES and no Ag (I) was detected, which demonstrated that the product has good safety. (7) Y C 18 − 3 = M P X P M F X F × 100 % where M P and M F stood for the mass of product and raw material; X P and X F stood for the content of C18-3 in the product and raw material. 3.8.3 Extractant regeneration Recycling of extractant could effectively reduce industrial costs. To investigate the regenerability and recycling times of extractant in the experiment, the Ag(I)-alcohol phase after multiple-step reverse extraction (Ag(I)-alcohol phase F in Fig. 13) was used to re-extract the equal volume of fresh 400 mg·ml−1 methyl ether petroleum ether solution. It should be noted that 1-hexene in the Ag(I)-alcohol phase F should be removed in a shaded vacuum environment before re-extract, since 1-hexene coordinating with Ag(I) reduced the amount of free active carriers. AgBF4/1,4-BDO extractant was used to re-extract fresh 400 mg·ml−1 methyl ether petroleum ether solution 4 times, and the experimental results were shown in Fig. 14 . As could be seen from Fig. 14, the purity of C18-3 in the extraction phase was stable at around 60%. The extraction yield of C18-3 decreased slightly, but E C18-3 could still reach 74.58% in the fourth extraction operation. The reason for the decrease in extraction yield was mainly due to the fact that the reverse extraction operation cannot extract all FAMEs from the extraction phase, so the amount of active Ag(I) coordinated with fresh unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters reduced. Therefore, to solve this problem, the Ag(I)-alcohol phase should be washed more times during reverse extraction process to remove residual FAMEs."
13,Conclusions,"A novel extractant, silver-based dihydric alcohol, was proposed to enrich methyl linolenate from tallow seed oil methyl ester by liquid–liquid extraction. The extraction yield and selectivity were related to dihydric alcohol structure, Ag(I) concentration, extraction temperature and feed concentration. 1,4-BDO with suitable polarity and hydrogen bond acidity could dissolve AgBF4 and FAMEs well, and separate C18-3 from its homologs. The extraction yield and selectivity of C18-3 could be improved effectively by AgBF4 and low extraction temperature, and satisfactory extraction yield and high selectivity was obtained even at high feed concentration. The C18-3 product with purity of 93.36% and yield of 73.76% was obtained by a multi-step reverse extraction. And the extractant showed good regenerability. The results indicated that silver-based dihydric alcohol was a promising extractant for methyl linolenate separation."
