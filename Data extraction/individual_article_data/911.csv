0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen cannot only alleviate the current energy shortage, but also can effectively solve the environmental pollution problems caused by fossil fuel combustion. Therefore, the preparation of efficient photocatalyst has become the focus of scientists. In the past few decades, a large number of semiconductor materials have been used to photocatalytic water-splitting for hydrogen production, such as: TiO2 and its complex [1–8], Cu2O [9], WO3 [10,11], CdS [12–16], ZnIn2S4 [17–20], polyoxometalates [21], nitrogen oxides [22,23], etc. Among them, ZnIn2S4 as a representative of ternary sulfide, has great potential in its capacities of electronic storage, light transmission and luminous properties, so it has gradually become a kind of promising photocatalyst in the study of photocatalytic hydrogen production [24,25]. However, the hydrogenation activity of pure ZnIn2S4 is not high, and it is usually required to add Pt as a cocatalyst in the process to improve its hydrogen production activity. It is well known that Pt is a rare and expensive metal, therefore, it is particularly important to find a non-noble metal or non-metal substance to replace Pt, in order to reduce the cost of photocatalytic hydrogen production and expand the application of it. As having a large specific surface area [26], good transmission of light [27], fast electrons and high carrier rates, graphene has been used as a catalyst for photocatalytic water-splitting [28–33]. Certainly, the two-dimensional (2D) graphene can also act as a cocatalyst to improve the hydrogen evolution activity of the catalyst and can be used as a candidate to replace Pt [31]. It has been reported that Chen et al. [34] prepared a series of composite catalysts of reductive oxidized graphene (RGO) and ZnIn2S4, and found that the its hydrogen production efficiency was positive correlation with the reduction degrees of RGO, and the highest hydrogen production efficiency of 27.8 μmol/h was got by using the RGO/ZnIn2S4 catalyst with the reduction degree of 87%. Zhou et al. [35] prepared a series of RGO-ZnIn2S4 nanosheet catalysts by self-assembled hydrothermal synthesis method, and found that the highest hydrogen production rate of the catalyst was 81.6 μmol/h when the content of RGO was 1.5 wt% with 0.35 mol/L Na2S and 0.25 mol/L Na2SO3 mixed aqueous solution as sacrificial agent. Ye et al. [36] prepared a series of RGO/ZnIn2S4 composite catalysts by using a one-pot method, and found that the hydrogen production rate was up to 40.7 μmol/h when the content of RGO was 1.0 wt% with the mixed solution containing 2.0 mL of lactic acid as the sacrificial agent. In addition, it has been reported that zero-dimensional graphene quantum dots (0D GQDs) can also promote the hydrogen production activity of photocatalysts [37,38]. Yu et al. [39] immobilized GQDs on CdS/TiO2-NA and TiO2-NA through simple impregnation method to prepare a series of GQD/CdS/TiO2-NA and GQD/TiO2-NA photocatalysts. The result showed that the hydrogen production rates of CdS/TiO2-NA and TiO2-NA were enhanced by the successful loading of GQDs, which were 18 μmol/h and 12 μmol/h, respectively. Thus, it can be seen that different dimensions of graphene (different graphene size) can affect the catalytic activity of the catalyst, however as for the effect of different sizes in the same dimension of graphene on hydrogen production activity of ZnIn2S4 is rarely reported, therefore, it is necessary to study. In order to study the effect of different sizes of two-dimensional graphene on the hydrogen production activity of ZnIn2S4, ZnIn2S4/graphene composite catalysts with different graphene sizes were prepared by alcohol heat method, and characterized by UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy (Raman), specific surface area analyzer, and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The activity of photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen under visible light was also investigated."

Graphene was purchased from Aladdin Reagent Shanghai Co., Ltd. China."
3,Preparation of photocatalyst,"2.2 Preparation of photocatalyst 2.2.1 Preparation of oxidized graphene of different sizes Separation of different sizes of oxidized graphene (differential centrifugation): (1) The oxidized graphene prepared by the Hummers method was placed in a centrifuge and centrifuged at 2000 r/min for 10 min, and the supernatant and precipitate were collected respectively. These supernatant sample and precipitate sample were recorded as A1 and B1, respectively. (2) The supernatant A1 was centrifuged at 4000 r/min for 10 min, with the supernatant and precipitate being collected, respectively. These supernatant sample and precipitate sample were recorded as A2 and B2, respectively. (3) The supernatant A2 was centrifuged at 6000 r/min for 10 min, with the supernatant and precipitate being collected respectively. These supernatant sample and precipitate sample were recorded as A3 and B3, respectively. (4) The supernatant A3 was centrifuged at 8000 r/min for 10 min, with the supernatant and precipitate being collected respectively. These supernatant sample and precipitate sample were recorded as A4 and B4, respectively. (5) The supernatant A4 was centrifuged at 10,000 r/min for 10 min, the precipitate of which was collected, and the precipitate collected at 8000–10000 r/min was recorded as B5. (6) The precipitate B1-B5 were dissolved in absolute ethanol respectively, and then the prepared GO of different sizes were stored separately in the brown reagent bottles which numbered 1–5 for subsequent use. 2.2.2 Preparation of ZnIn2S4/grapheme The ZnIn2S4/graphene catalysts were prepared by the alcohol thermal method. 0.2% each size of oxidized graphene solution was placed in 100 mL beaker, 40 mL of ethanol and 10 mL of glycerol were added in, and then ultrasonic stirred for 30 min. After that, 2.56 mmol ZnSO4·7H2O, 20.4 mmol TAA and 5.90 mmol In(NO3)3·4H2O were added successively, followed by further ultrasonic stirring with 1200 r/min for 30 min. The obtained yellow transparent liquid was placed in a high pressure reactor and reacted for 12 h in an oven at a certain temperature, then removed out for natural cooling. The obtained dark green precipitate was washed with ethanol for several times, and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h, and then the obtained solid powder was taken out and stored in a dry dark place. The catalyst was named 0.2%-ZIS/G-k (k represents size). Ye et al. [36] studied the formation mechanism of RGO/ZnIn2S4 and found that GO is reduced to RGO by the organic solvent. In this work, organic solvent (ethanol and glycerol) are the surfactant for the reduction of RGO."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The UV–Vis absorption spectra of the catalysts were recorded using a UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-2501PC, Shimadzu, Japan) in the spectral range of 300–750 nm. The crystal structure and composition of the catalysts were characterized by XRD (Rigaku, D/max 2500) at room temperature, and the patterns were recorded over the angular range 15–60 ° (2θ), using a scan rate of 5°/min, the Cu-Kα radiation and the Ni filter with working voltage and current of 40 kV and 20 mA, respectively. The surface morphology of the catalysts was observed by SEM (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). The BET surface area was evaluated by N2 adsorption in a constant volume adsorption apparatus (Bel sorp II, Bayer Japan Co., Ltd., Japan). The analyses of PL spectra and the molecular vibration of the catalysts were investigated by Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw in Via, 325 nm He–Gd). The calculation of grain size is based on formula (1) (1) D = K λ / β c o s θ In Eq. (1), D, K, λ, β, θ are the average grain size vertical to reflective plane, grain shape factor (Scherrer constant), X-ray wavelength, pure increased width of diffraction line and glancing angle, respectively."
5,Photocatalytic activity measurements,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity measurements Photocatalytic reactions were conducted in a self-made gas closed reactor. The light source was a 350-W Xe lamp (Shenzhen Stone-lighting Opto Device Co., Ltd., China) and the UV part of the light was removed by a cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm). The performance evaluation of the catalysts was carried out in the 200 mL mixed solution of 0.35 mol/L Na2S and 0.25 mol/L Na2SO3. Na2S and Na2SO3 were used as sacrificial agents to scavenge photo-generated holes. The specific steps are as follows: 200 mg of the photocatalyst was added into the 200 mL reaction solution, and the suspension in the reactor was uniformly dispersed under magnetic stirring. The temperature for all the photocatalytic reactions was kept at 25 ± 1 °C through the cyclic condensate system. Before the reaction started, argon gas was bubbled through the reaction mixture for 15 min to remove air prior to the reaction, then the light source was opened. 500 μL of the solution was drawn every 30 min for the measurement of the concentration of hydrogen by a gas chromatograph (Shanghai Precision&Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., GC-112A, High-performance carbon molecular sieve packed column (2 m*3mm)), equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The carrier gas was argon (99.99%)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Size discrimination of the oxidized graphene,"3.1 Size discrimination of the oxidized graphene Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of the oxidized graphene and their corresponding size distribution. As shown in Fig. 1A and A’, the size of most of the oxidized graphene obtained at 2000 r/min is larger and the size between 12 and 18 μm has the highest content of about 46%. In Fig. 1B and B’, it can be seen that the size of most of the oxidized graphene obtained at 2000–4000 r/min is significantly smaller than the size in Fig. 1A and A’, and the size between 7 and 12 μm has the highest content of about 53%. As shown in Fig. 1C and C’ to Fig. 1E and E’, there is still a small amount of large size oxidized graphene at 4000–6000 r/min, 6000–8000 r/min and 8000–10000 r/min, but most of the sizes of the oxidized graphene are smaller and smaller, and the sizes which having the highest content at the three rotational speeds are 5–7 μm, 3–5 μm and 1–3 μm, and their contents are 54%, 61% and 77%, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the different sizes of oxidized graphene can be sieved by the differential centrifugation method, and the size of the oxidized graphene gradually decreased as the centrifugal speed increased."
8,Characterization of ZnIn2S4/graphene,"3.2 Characterization of ZnIn2S4/graphene 3.2.1 XRD analysis Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of 0.2%-ZIS/G-k (k = 1–3 μm, 3–5 μm, 5–7 μm, 7–12 μm, 12–18 μm). It can be seen from Fig. 2 that all diffraction peaks of the 0.2% -ZIS/G-k catalyst could be assigned to the crystal phase of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 (JCPDS No. 65-2023), and no presence of ZnS, oxides and other impurities was detected. From Fig. 1, it also can be seen that the characteristic peaks of the patterns do not show any obvious shift or strong change, which indicates that the load of graphene does not affect the crystal structure of ZnIn2S4, the same phenomenon was observed in the research of Chen et al. [40]. Additionally, the crystal sizes of the catalysts calculated by the Scherrer equation are also listed in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1, with the decrease of graphene size, crystal size of the catalysts firstly decreases and then increases. When the graphene size is 5–7 μm, the crystal size of the catalyst reaches the minimum of 3.4 nm. 3.2.2 Morphology analysis Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of 0.2%-ZIS/G-k (k = 1–3 μm, 3–5 μm, 5–7 μm, 7-12 μm, 12–18 μm). When k = 12–18 μm (Fig. 3A and A’), due to its large size, graphene is present in large flakes, making a part of the ZnIn2S4 spheres been warped. While on both surfaces of the separated large flakes graphene and ZnIn2S4 spheres, uniform petal-like projections are formed. When k = 7–12 μm (Fig. 3B and B’), due to its size decreases, graphene cannot wrap ZnIn2S4 sphere and only a small amount of petal-like projections formed on its surface. While the other ZnIn2S4 spheres which not grow on the graphene surface form petal-like projections and the gap gradually open. When k = 5–7 μm (Fig. 3C and C’), due to the graphene size continuous decreases, a part of the ZnIn2S4 spheres containing a large number of petal-like projections are loaded on graphene, and it is also found that the surface of the graphene is uniformly grown with petal-like projections. When k = 3–5 μm (Fig. 3D and D’), graphene is present in small flakes and high content, resulting in a number of ZnIn2S4 spheres gather together, the petal-like projections of the ZnIn2S4 sphere are warped again, and the pore structure gradually disappear. When k = 1–3 μm (Fig. 3E and E’), a large number of small pieces of graphene start to aggregate and stack on the surface of the ZnIn2S4 sphere, destroying the surface morphology of the ZnIn2S4 sphere, causing the majority of petal-like projections fallen off, and a large number of pore structure disappeared. According to the above analysis, it can be found that the size of graphene has a significant effect on the morphology of the catalyst, and when k = 5–7 μm, the morphology of the catalyst is the best. 3.2.3 BET and total pore volume analysis The results of the BET surface area and the total pore volume of 0.2%-ZIS/G-k (k = 1–3 μm, 3–5 μm, 5–7 μm, 7–12 μm, 12–18 μm) are listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1 that with the decrease of graphene size, the BET surface area and the total pore volume of 0.2%-ZIS/G-k increase first and then decrease, When k = 5–7 μm, the BET surface area and the total pore volume reach the maximum, and are 293.81 m2/g, 0.1525 cm3/g, respectively, which are coincided with the morphology analysis. This is mainly due to the appropriate reduction in the size of graphene is beneficial to reduce the encapsulation of the sheet to ZnIn2S4 catalyst and prevent the occurrence of self-stacked condition of graphene, so that the specific surface area of the catalyst and the total pore volume is increased. In addition, the large specific surface area of the graphene itself and a large number of petal-like projections grown on its surface is another reason for the increase of the specific surface area of the ZnIn2S4 catalyst. 3.2.4 UV–vis DRS analysis Fig. 4 shows the UV–Vis DRS of 0.2%-ZIS/G-k (k = 1–3 μm, 3–5 μm, 5–7 μm, 7–12 μm, 12–18 μm). The corresponding absorption edges and band gaps are listed in Table 1. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the shapes of the absorbing edges are steep and the absorption in the visible region is strong. This steep absorption edge indicates that the bandgap excitation is due to a bandgap transition, not due to the transition from impurity levels to the conduction band of the catalyst [41] . As shown in Table 1, with the decrease of graphene size, the absorption edge of 0.2%-ZIS/G-k is gradually increase, and the corresponding bandgap shows a tendency to decrease gradually. This is because as the graphene size decreases, graphene gradually stacked together, resulting in a gradual increase in the absorptive property of the catalyst. In summary, the size of graphene has a significant impact on the absorption edge and band gap of the series of 0.2%-ZIS/G-k catalyst. 3.2.5 PL analysis Fig. 5 shows the PL spectra of 0.2%-ZIS/G-k (k = 1–3 μm, 3–5 μm, 5–7 μm, 7–12 μm, 12–18 μm) at a wavelength of 325 nm. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that 0.2%-ZIS/G-(12–18 μm) has a luminescence band at 610 nm and the rest 0.2%-ZIS/G-k has a luminescent band at 600 nm. Since the absorbance bands of the 0.2%-ZIS/G-k series catalysts are between 515 and 542 nm and their corresponding PL-characterized luminescence bands are at 600 nm or 610 nm, this indicates that the energy of the radiation photons at the absorption wavelength (515–542 nm) is greater than the energy at the emission peak wavelength (600 nm or 610 nm). Jing et al. [42] introduced the PL performance and the mechanism of nano-sized semiconductor materials. According to their study, the PL performance of the 0.2%-ZIS/G-k series catalyst shown in Fig. 5 is an excitonic PL process, in which the non-radiative transitions of excited electrons from the conduction band (CB) bottom to different sub-bands (or surface states) occur first and subsequent radiative transitions from the sub-band to the valence band (VB) top take place. Therefore, the energy of the radiative photon, which is the energy difference between the sub-band and valence band (VB) top, is lower than the band gap energy. As can be seen from Fig. 7 that with the decrease of graphene size, the photoluminescence intensity of the catalyst initially increases first and then decreases. In particular, when k = 5–7 μm, the catalyst 0.2%-ZIS/G-(5–7 μm) has the lowest photoluminescence intensity, which is similar to that observed by Xin et al. [43] The reason is that the graphene supported on the catalyst surface can effectively transfer electrons, inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes, so that the fluorescence intensity of the sample decreases. Wang et al. [44] investigated the temporal evolution of fluorescence from carbon nanotubes and pointed out that a low fluorescence quantum yield originated from the rapidly quenching fluorescence rather than from the inherent weakness of the radiative transitions. Because of its greater electron mobility, graphene affords quick electron transfer, resulting in a decrease of the emission intensity. 3.2.6 Raman analysis Fig. 6 shows the Raman spectrum of 0.2%-ZIS/G-k (k = 1–3 μm, 3–5 μm, 5–7 μm, 7–12 μm, 12–18 μm) and 2.0%-ZIS/G-(5–7 μm). The Raman spectrum of oxidized graphene has two characteristic peaks, one is G peak at 1594 cm−1 and the other is D peak at 1354 cm−1. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that when the graphene content is 0.2%, the D peak is not found in the five different sizes of graphene, and the weak G peak can be found only when the size is larger than 5–7 μm. This may be due to the small size and low content of graphene, because the D peak and G peak can be observed under high content (2.0%) of graphene."
9,Evaluation of photocatalytic activity,"3.3 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity Fig. 7 shows the results of photocatalytic hydrogen production of 0.2%-ZIS/G-k (k = 1–3 μm, 3–5 μm, 5–7 μm, 7–12 μm, 12–18 μm). It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate tends to increase first and then decrease with the decrease of graphene size, the order of activity is 5–7 μm > 7–12 μm ~ 3–5 μm ~ 12–18 μm > 1–3 μm. When k = 5–7 μm, the hydrogen production rate reached the highest of 40.85 μmol/g·h. In order to find out the deep-seated reasons affecting the photocatalytic activity of 0.2%-ZIS/G-k, we compared and analyzed their activities and characterizations data. For 0.2%-ZIS/G-(5–7 μm), it has the smallest crystal size, maximum specific surface area and total pore volume and maximum separation of electron-hole pairs, thus demonstrating the best catalytic activity of H2 evolution. For 0.2%-ZIS/G-(7–12 μm), although the separation ability of the electron-hole pairs is weaker than those of 0.2%-ZIS/G-(1–3 μm) and 0.2%-ZIS/G-(3–5 μm), the crystal size is less than that of 0.2%-ZIS/G-(3–5 μm), but it has a larger specific surface area and total pore volume than them. In addition, its specific surface area, total pore volume, crystal size and separation ability of the electron-hole pairs are stronger than those of 0.2%-ZIS/G-(12–18 μm), leading to its photocatalytic activity second only after the optimal catalyst. For 0.2%-ZIS/G-(1–3 μm) and 0.2%-ZIS/G- (3–5 μm), although their specific surface area and total pore volume are smaller than those of 0.2%-ZIS/G-(12–18 μm), But they have a better separation ability of the electron-hole pairs and bigger crystal size than those of 0.2%-ZIS/G-(12–18 μm), making their activity not much different from that of 0.2%-ZIS/G- (12–18 μm). While the activity of 0.2%-ZIS/G-(12–18 μm) is slightly better than that of 0.2%-ZIS/G- (1–3 μm), which indicates that the specific surface area and the total pore volume play an important role. For 0.2%-ZIS/G-(1–3 μm), although it has a strong electron-hole pair separation ability and maximum light absorption performance, its specific surface area and total pore volume are smaller than other catalysts, so its photocatalytic activity is the worst. From the above analysis, it can be concluded that, with graphene size changes, the property of the catalyst also changes, which also led to changes in its photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of 0.2%-ZIS/G-k is mainly related to its specific surface area and total pore volume, then to crystal size. In addition, the optical absorption performance and the separation ability of the electron-hole pairs are also factors affecting the photocatalytic activity. Fig. 8 shows the experimental results of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of 0.2%-ZIS/G-(5–7 μm) samples without Pt. Using a mixture of Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial agents, the experiment was conducted in 5 cycles for total 15 h. After one cycle of the experiment, the gas in the reactor was removed and the next cycle was continued under the same conditions. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the hydrogen evolution rate of 0.2%-ZIS/G-(5–7 μm) does not change greatly in the photocatalytic experiment within 15 h, which indicates that the catalyst has good stability."
10,Conclusions,"A series of ZnIn2S4/graphene catalysts with different graphene sizes were synthesized by the alcohol-thermal method. The characterization results show that the different sizes (k) of graphene can be separated by differential centrifugation, the sizes obtained at ≤2000 r/min, 2000–4000 r/min, 4000–6000 r/min, 6000–8000 r/min and 8000–10000 r/min are 12–18 μm, 7–12 μm, 5–7 μm, 3–5 μm and 1–3 μm, respectively. With the decrease of graphene size, the crystal size of the catalyst decreased first and then increased, the specific surface area and the total pore volume increased first and then decreased, the absorption wavelength increased, and the separation efficiency of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs increased first and then decreased. In addition, graphene size had a significant effect on the surface morphology of the catalyst. The experimental results showed that with the decrease of graphene size, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate increased first and then decreased. When k = 5–7 μm, under the condition of no Pt cocatalyst, the maximum hydrogen production rate was 40.85 μmol/g·h. The photocatalytic H2 evolution activities of 0.2%-ZIS/G-k are mainly related to their specific surface area and total pore volume, then to crystal size. In addition, the optical absorption performance and the separation ability of the electron-hole pairs are also factors affecting the photocatalytic activity."
