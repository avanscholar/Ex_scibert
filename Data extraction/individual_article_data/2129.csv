0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a better alternative fuel for the future mainly due to its non-polluting characteristics. Biological processes for hydrogen production are more friendly to environment and less energy intensive than thermochemical and electrochemical processes [1]. Biohydrogen can be produced by photosynthetic microorganisms or non-photosynthetic fermentative bacteria. The latter can produce hydrogen without light under anaerobic conditions, which makes the bioreactor design much simpler than for the photosynthetic microorganisms. The reported fermentative hydrogen-producing bacteria include Enterobacter, Bacillus, Rhodopseudomonas, Clostridium species, etc. [2–7]. Some of them are facultative anaerobes and others are obligate anaerobes. The facultative anaerobes have an advantage over the obligate ones on the cultivation because the former can live in aerobic condition. So far, all the reports of hydrogen-producing bacteria focused on the freshwater fields, whereas, few reports were found on biohydrogen production by the bacteria from marine environments. Mariculture of China is largest in the world. The mode of Chinese mariculture is intensive, which results in degradation of local environment due to mariculture wastewater [8]. Furthermore, the eutrophication of coastal area causes the occurrence of harmful algal blooms. So it is necessary to treat the wastewater and organic waste produced by the mariculture. Now it was reported that anaerobic digestion of organic substrate to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide had been a well-developed biological treatment for the fresh wastewater and organic waste [9]. Therefore, fermentative hydrogen production should be feasible by biological treatment for the marine wastewater and organic waste in theory. The prior prerequisite of fermentative hydrogen production utilized mariculture wastewater and organic waste is to screen the marine hydrogen-producing bacterial strains. Many researches have been reported to screen from various fresh environments such as landfill, sewage sludge, ponds, etc. [2,3]. On the contrary, there are few reports about the hydrogen-producing organism isolated from marine environments. Among various marine environments, the muddy substrates of mangrove are a good sample for selection of fermentative organisms on hydrogen production. Mangrove is a specialized ecosystem of the tropical areas. The muddy substrates of mangrove ecosystem are abundance in nutrients, low in oxygen and variable in salinity, in which the continuously shed foliage of the evergreen trees were decomposed by various microorganisms [10]. The transitional position of mangrove between marine and terrestrial environments has led to the diversity of bacterial communities. In this work, a new fermentative bacterium, Pantoea agglomerans, was isolated from mangrove sludge. It was found that this strain has unique properties in hydrogen production different from other fresh hydrogen-producing bacteria. The hydrogen production performance by this strain was optimized under various batch conditions in order to determine the optimal conditions for the maximal hydrogen production."
1,Material and methods,
2,Isolation of the bacterial strain,"2.1 Isolation of the bacterial strain The hydrogen-producing bacterial strain was isolated from the mangrove of Beihai, Guangxi province, China, (longitude of 109 and latitude of 21), during low tide, approximately 30–40cm below the surface, in February 2006. The sludge sample was diluted with sterile medium LM-H in a 150ml serum bottle (working volume 100ml) at 37°C and agitated in a shaking incubator. The serum bottle was purged with nitrogen gas and sealed with a 12-mm-thick butyl rubber septum and an aluminum cap to produce the required anaerobic conditions. After cultivation at 37°C for 2 days, 1ml of the culture broth was inoculated in 50ml of the same medium. These procedures were repeated three times in order to enrich the hydrogen-producing bacterial strains. LM-H medium was modified from LM medium of Li et al. [11]. LM medium had been used for obtaining the high hydrogen-producing bacterial group in fresh fields. The composition of LM-H medium contained glucose (20g/l), yeast extract 1g/l, tryptone 4g/l and beef extract 2g/l. The substrate contained sufficient inorganics (g/l): NaCl 30, K2HPO4 1.5, MgCl2 0.1, FeSO4·7H2O 0.1, l-cysteine 0.5; trace element solution (containing MnSO4·7H2O 0.01, ZnSO4·7H2O 0.05, H3BO3 0.01, CaCl2·2H2O 0.01, Na2MoO4 0.01, CoCl2·6H2O 0.2), 10ml; vitamin solution (containing l-ascorbic acid 0.025, citric acid 0.02, pyridoxine hydrochloride 0.05, para-aminobenzoic acid 0.01, d-biotin 0.01, vitamin B1 0.02 and riboflavine 0.025) 10ml. The pH of the medium was adjusted initially to 7.5. The agar plates were prepared by adding 1.5% (w/v) agar to the LM-H medium. The hydrogen-producing fermentative bacterial strain was isolated with the method of anaerobic plate, described by Archana et al. [12] and many modifications. The culture broth by enrichment was spread onto LM-H agar plates, and then 1.5% (w/v) agar solution (<40°C) was poured on the plate till the broth was absorbed by the medium. Finally, the paraffin wax was overlaid in order to maintain the anaerobic condition. Following the development of colonies at 37°C, the overlaying was gently removed with a scalpel. Single colonies were removed from the liquid medium of LM-H and the steps as above were repeated more than three times to ensure the purity of the strains."
3,Morphological and biochemical test,"2.2 Morphological and biochemical test Morphological examination was carried out by a light microscope (Olympus, Japan). Biochemical and physiological determinations were made with Biolog Identification System according to the recommendation of the manufacturer (Biolog, USA)."
4,16S rDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis,"2.3 16S rDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis The chromosomal DNA was isolated using a slight modification of the method reported by Pitcher et al. [13]. Small amounts of biomass from the LM-H agar plates were mixed and gently homogenized in 100μl of TE buffer (pH 8) supplemented with 25μg/ml lysozyme (Sigma, Ltd.). The resulting solutions were incubated at 37°C overnight. The aqueous layers were separated by centrifugation and extracted with chloroform isoamyl alcohol (25:1, v/v). After the RNase treatment, the DNA was recovered with phenol and chloroform. A large fragment of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using the universal primers 8F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492R (5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) [14]. The PCR products were purified using a Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification system (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced by the company (Sangon, China). The closest known relatives of the new isolates were determined by performing a sequence database search. The sequences of the closely related strains were retrieved from GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining methods. Evolutionary distance matrices were generated using the method reported by Jukes and Cantor. The resultant neighbor-joining tree topology was evaluated using bootstrap analyses based on 1000 samples [15]. Alignment and phylogenetic analyses were carried out using the Mega program."
5,Optimization of culture conditions on biomass accumulation,"2.4 Optimization of culture conditions on biomass accumulation To determine the effects of initial pH, temperature and NaCl concentration on biomass accumulation, a serial of batch fermention was performed. The cells were cultured in a 10ml test tube (working volume 5ml) under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The batch operations were conducted at different initial pH (2.0–10.0), temperature (15–52°C) and NaCl concentration (0–8%) at glucose concentration of 20g/l. The biomass accumulation was determined by measuring the optical absorbance at 600nm using a spectrophotometer (UV757CRT, China)."
6,The factors changes in course of hydrogen production in batch fermentor,"2.5 The factors changes in course of hydrogen production in batch fermentor Hydrogen production experiments were carried out in 150ml serum bottles (working volume 100ml). The cells were added in a bottle with 100ml LM-H medium. To create anaerobic conditions, the liquid phase of the bottle was purged with nitrogen, and the Wheaton rubber septum stoppers were immediately replaced and tied down with plastic fasteners. The batch was then placed in an incubator/shaker at 37°C with an agitation rate. Biogas production was collected using the drainage method. Every 3–5h the fermentative products were sampled by 5ml injectors and determined the factors of pH, ORP (oxidation-reduction potential), optical absorbance of OD600 nm and the yield of hydrogen."
7,Optimization of batch conditions on hydrogen production,"2.6 Optimization of batch conditions on hydrogen production To describe the effects of initial glucose concentration, initial pH and NaCl concentration on hydrogen production, the batches described previously were performed. The batch operations were conducted at different NaCl concentration (0.4% and 3%), glucose concentration (5–60g/l), initial pH (5.0–10.0) and various carbon sources at 37°C with a fixed agitation rate. The hydrogen content of gaseous was monitored by the method of gas chromatography. The gas produced from the culture was collected by the method of drainage. The gas volume presented in this work was detected at room temperature."
8,Analytical methods,"2.7 Analytical methods The gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography GC-2010 (Tengzhou, China), which was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a Carboxen-1000 column (Tengzhou, China). Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at 58ml/min. The oven, injector, and detector were maintained at 70, 80, and 100°C, respectively."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Phenotypic characterization of the hydrogen-producing isolate,"3.1 Phenotypic characterization of the hydrogen-producing isolate A hydrogen-producing bacterium was isolated from mangrove sludge. The strain was a facultative aerobe. Microscopic examination showed that it was a Gram-negative bacterium in short-rod shape. Biochemical identification by Biolog identification system indicated that it was a new species, with no matches being found. Table 1 shows various carbon sources utilized by the strain. Sixty-four carbon sources are positive among 95 carbon sources, which indicated that the strain could be a good candidate for biotreatment of wastewater and organic waste. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis was carried out to identify the strain, and the 1418bp sequence (accession number EU590682) was determined. Based on the similarity of the 16S rRNA gene, the strain was found to be analogous to Pantoea agglomerans (99%), Enterobacter asburiae (99%) and Leclercia adecarboxylata (99%). A phylogenetic tree was constructed to further confirm the taxonomic status of strain BH-18 (Fig. 1 ). The tree showed the strain close to the branch of P. agglomerans. As results of microscopic examination, biochemical identification and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the strain was determined to belong to Enterobacteriaceae and was designated as P. agglomerans BH-18. Many fresh Enterobacter sp. strains are known to produce hydrogen from carbohydrates, for example, E. cloacae IIT-BT 08, E. asburiae SNU-1 and E. aerogenes HU-101, etc. [2,16–18]. P. agglomerans of Enterobacter is a new species that has never been optimized for hydrogen production, and it is first reported that the hydrogen-producing bacterial strain isolated from the marine environment to our knowledge. In addition, no difference was found between P. agglomerans BH-18 and the same fresh strains on the morphology of light microscope observation and the 16S rDNA sequence analysis. P. agglomerans was an opportunistic pathogen of plants and animals that are commonly isolated from plant surface, seeds, fruit, and animal feces [19–21]. Thus, the strain BH-18 may be from terrestrial environment because of the transitional position of mangrove between marine and terrestrial environments."
11,Optimization of culture conditions on biomass accumulation,"3.2 Optimization of culture conditions on biomass accumulation The optimum culture conditions were investigated for the further study of hydrogen production. The effects of pH, temperature and salt concentration on growth of P. agglomerans BH-18 were studied under the aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Fig. 2 shows the effect of pH value on biomass accumulation. Under aerobic condition initial pH value did not affect on biomass accumulation, whereas under anaerobic condition obvious effect of initial pH value (4.0–10.0) was found with the optimum initial pH value at 8.0–9.0. These results indicated strain BH-18 was a facultative anaerobe with a better growth under the aerobic condition; Fig. 3 shows the effect of salt concentration on biomass accumulation. Strain BH-18 could live at the NaCl concentration from 0 to 7.5% and had a higher cell growth at lower salt concentration, which indicated it as a salt-tolerance bacterial strain; Fig. 4 shows the effect of culture temperature on biomass accumulation. The strain grew at a temperature range from 20 to 52°C with the optimum growth temperature at 30°C. Larger amount of biomass accumulation was obtained under aerobic culture conditions than under anaerobic ones. The optical absorbance OD600nm of the former was double to that of the latter (Fig. 3). It means that the biomass accumulation may be obtained quickly under aerobic culture, collected and added in anaerobic fermentation to shorten the period of hydrogen production. Otherwise, higher cell growth was found at lower salt concentration, further indicating that the origin of strain BH-18 could be from terrestrial environment. In our opinion, the salt-tolerance mechanism of bacterial strain could be working to maintain the Na+ balance in cells in order to adapt the change of environment. So the cells grow better still in low salt concentration because its growth may be inhibited after the tolerance mechanism was activated."
12,Batch fermentation profiles of the isolate strain,"3.3 Batch fermentation profiles of the isolate strain In batch fermentation, P. agglomerans BH-18 was found as an effective hydrogen producer with the maximum hydrogen yield and overall hydrogen production rate at 1510ml/l and 125ml/h/l, respectively, at an initial glucose concentration of 20g/l and a pH of 7.2 in marine culture condition. The evolution of hydrogen started at 10h and stopped at 22h. The transient relationships between hydrogen production and biomass accumulation, pH value or ORP were revealed in detail during the anaerobic fermentation (Fig. 5 ). The results demonstrated that the evolution of hydrogen appeared to start when cell growth entered the late exponential phase (13h), whereas the hydrogen production speed reached a maximum in the early stationary phase (16h). Most of the hydrogen was produced in the stationary phase. This seems to imply that the generation of hydrogen was not a preferable event during assimilation of carbon substrate for the gain of biomass. This result was similar with the report of Clostridium butyricum CGS5 [3]. The pH value decreased from 5.5 to 4.9 and the ORP maintained from −42 to −91mV at the period of hydrogen production (Fig. 5). The decrease of pH value was attributed to the accumulation of organic acids [16–18]. Hydrogen production occurred at the pH of 5.5–4.9, suggesting that pH control at an appropriate level may be required to increase the yield of hydrogen production. ORP is used to determine the oxidizing or reducing properties of solutions, which is a useful control parameter in wastewater treatment processes [22]. ORP is correlated with many components, such as pH value, salinity, organic substrate. It is a broad parameter exhibiting the electromotive force in aqueous solution [23]. In fermentation, the higher hydrogen production rate appeared at the lower ORP value, suggesting that the ORP may be an on-line control parameter to improve the efficiency of hydrogen production."
13,Effect of initial pH value on hydrogen production,"3.4 Effect of initial pH value on hydrogen production Various organic acids accumulate resulting in a significant decrease in pH in the culture medium during the process of fermentation. The decrease in pH caused a significant fall in hydrogen production. Many hydrogen-producing strains evolved hydrogen in a range of pH value [2,3,16–18]. Then, the hydrogen fermentation was conducted at six different initial pH values, namely, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, to identify the optimal initial pH for hydrogen production by P. agglomerans BH-18. In our study, the gas-phase H2 content was in the range of 59–62% for all tests and the final pH of fermentative liquid was in the range of 4.28–5.97, with the highest hydrogen yield of 1700ml/l at 4.33 (data not shown). The effect of initial pH value on hydrogen production is shown in Fig. 6 . Strain BH-18 could produce hydrogen at a wider range of initial pH 5–10. The maximum for hydrogen production yield was 1700ml/l at pH 6 and the level of hydrogen production was higher at pH 6 than either pH 5 or 7. All the results confirmed that initial pH value was a critical effect factor on hydrogen production. A high level of hydrogen yield was 1100ml/l produced at pH 5, whereas strictly anaerobic C. butyricum CGS5, which was isolated from anaerobic sewage sludge, did not produce any hydrogen at pH 5 [3]. The optimum initial pH value of strain BH-18 was at 8.0–9.0 in biomass accumulation, but the optimum initial pH value was at 6.0 in hydrogen production. This may be due to fact that the biomass accumulation speed at initial pH value at 6.0 was in favor of the availability of electrons for hydrogenase to produce hydrogen, decrease the metabolic electron flow towards biosynthesis."
14,Effect of initial glucose concentration on hydrogen production,"3.5 Effect of initial glucose concentration on hydrogen production Organic loading usually plays an important role in anaerobic hydrogen production. The effect of initial glucose concentration on hydrogen production was examined during anaerobic cultivation at pH 7.2. The final level of hydrogen production reached a maximum when the initial glucose concentration was 10g/l. The final level of hydrogen production decreased when the initial glucose concentration was 20g/l. No hydrogen production occurred at the initial glucose concentration of 60g/l (Fig. 6). The optimal initial glucose concentration for hydrogen production was 10g/l with hydrogen production yield and overall hydrogen productivity at 2246ml/l and 160ml/h/l, respectively. The level of hydrogen production increased with raising initial glucose concentration up to 10g/l, and the final cell concentration increased with increasing initial glucose concentration up to 20g/l (Fig. 6). This result indicated again that no direct correlation exists between biomass accumulation and hydrogen production. Normally, a direct comparison of the hydrogen production potential between various strains is difficult because the level of hydrogen production is reported in different ways. In this study, P. agglomerans had a similar hydrogen production potential to E. asburiae SNU-1 with overall hydrogen productivity at 174ml/l/h from 25g glucose/l [2]."
15,Hydrogen production of BH-18 from various carbon sources,"3.6 Hydrogen production of BH-18 from various carbon sources The level of hydrogen production of strain BH-18 was examined from various carbon sources. The concentration of each carbon source was fixed at 10g/l. And the gas-phase of H2 content in batch fermentation was detected. As a result, strain BH-18 could produce hydrogen from various carbon sources such as monosaccharides (glucose, fructose), disaccharides (sucrose, lactose), polysaccharides (starch) and alcohols (sorbitol, glycerol) (Table 2 ). However, the amount produced from starch and glycerol was quite low. The content of hydrogen was from 20 to 30% produced by strain BH-18 using glucose and sorbitol. The highest level of hydrogen production was obtained from sucrose but an equal amount of hydrogen was produced from fructose and lactose."
16,Effect of different salt concentrations on hydrogen production,"3.7 Effect of different salt concentrations on hydrogen production Salt is essential for cells, composed primarily of sodium chloride. Commonly, the salt concentrations of natural water or various wastewaters were either fresh or marine. Thus, we investigated the difference in hydrogen production of P. agglomerans BH-18 under 0.4% (w/v) and 3% (w/v) NaCl concentration culture. Fig. 7 shows the effect of two different NaCl concentrations on hydrogen production. In marine condition, the maximum hydrogen production yield and hydrogen productivity was 1514ml/l and 137ml/l/h at an initial glucose concentration of 20g/l and pH value of 7.2, whereas it increased by 27% in fresh condition. The results indicated the salt-tolerant strain BH-18 could produce large amount of hydrogen under either fresh or marine culture condition. The hydrogen productivity of strain BH-18 was higher under fresh than marine condition, suggesting that it possesses the potential of engineering strain for biohydrogen from the fresh and marine wastewater and organic waste. On the other hand, these results again indicated that strain BH-18 might be originated from the land. It may suffer for ages to become a marine strain, which can grow and breed in marine environment. During the process of evolution, not only salt-tolerance mechanism could be activated, but also other metabolic pathways could be affected. So the slower speed of biomass accumulation and lower hydrogen production were appeared in the marine culture conditions."
17,Conclusions,"A hydrogen-producing marine bacterial strain BH-18 was successfully isolated from mangrove sludge and was identified as P. agglomerans. The strain was a salt-tolerant facultative anaerobe with the optimum pH at 8.0–9.0 and temperature at 30°C. The level of fermentative hydrogen production by this strain was influenced by the medium initial pH, initial glucose concentration and salt concentration. The optimum initial glucose concentration value was at 10g/l, which resulted in a respective maximum hydrogen production and overall hydrogen productivity of 2246ml/l and 160ml/h/l. In particular, this strain has unique properties in adaptability to salt concentration. It could live at the NaCl concentration from 0 to 7.5% Hydrogen production by strain BH-18 shows higher potential under either fresh or marine culture conditions. In marine condition, hydrogen productivity was 108ml/l/h at an initial glucose concentration of 20g/l and pH value of 7.2, whereas increased by 27% in fresh condition. Therefore, P. agglomerans BH-18 can be considered to be an engineering strain for biohydrogen production from the fresh and marine wastewater. However, further study will be needed before practical application."
