0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a potential alternative fuel. It is the most abundant element on earth and is present in all materials. Hydrogen can be obtained from renewable sources, and it does not emit pollutants during combustion or when it is used in fuel cells. The disadvantage is that hydrogen is an expensive element that is not freely found in nature in a usable form. In addition, portions of hydrogen production require substantial amounts of energy, which is often provided in the form of fossil fuels. The need for more economical and environmentally friendly methods of obtaining hydrogen has led researchers to investigate the possibility of obtaining hydrogen gas from biomass fermentation. The fermentation of organic matter is an appropriate and sustainable method for producing hydrogen. Besides using materials that are easy to obtain, fermentation minimizes the problems related to the disposal of tailing wastes. During hydrogen production, different substrates can be used, such as industrial and domestic waste, which is rich in carbonaceous matter [1]. Through fermentation, these wastes are degraded with less pollution. The ability to conduct the process under ambient pressure and temperature is another important factor because it reduces the operating expenses for hydrogen production. In glucose fermentation, the formation of hydrogen is accompanied by the production of acetic acid, butyric acid and ethanol. Depending on which metabolic pathway is used, one product or another is formed in greater quantities. Glucose fermentation can also generate propionic acid; however, propionic acid is an undesirable product because hydrogen is necessary for its formation. The traditional pathway for ethanol production from glucose generates only alcohol and CO2. This pathway could be a useful method because hydrogen acts as an electron donor. Studies in which both hydrogen and ethanol were generated were found in the literature [2–4]. Hwang et al. [5] showed alternative pathways that generate hydrogen, ethanol and acetic acid. Hydrogen production via dark fermentation has been studied with various types of reactors, such as fixed-bed reactors [6,7], continuous stirred-tank reactors [8,9], and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB) [10]. Another type of reactor configuration that was recently used for treating wastewater is the anaerobic fluidized-bed reactor (AFBR) [2,3,11–20]. Fluidized-bed reactors have the advantage of being more compact than other reactors. Additionally, certain characteristics of an AFBR make this reactor configuration beneficial to the anaerobic process. These characteristics include the use of particles in a fluidized state, which increases the effective area for depositing microorganisms that degrade organic matter in the residues that are being treated; the mixing conditions of the fluidization-related mass transfer efficiency; and easy operation. Still, compared with other reactors, fluidized-bed reactors have a higher biomass adhesion, a high rate of organic operation, a low hydraulic retention time (HRT) and better mixing conditions [14,15]. Research conducted on AFBRs has demonstrated the efficiency of the reactor for hydrogen production [2,12,14,15,18–20]. Several parameters from these studies were used as references for the study of hydrogen production (pH, temperature, type of reactor, substrate and nutrient) as well as to analyze the fluid dynamic behavior of the reactor and its influence on the fermentation process. Studies [2,7,12,21] on hydrodynamic parameters such as superficial velocity, mixing conditions and porosity have shown that there may be an important link between hydrogen production and the hydrodynamic conditions applied to the reactor. However, there were few studies on this subject, and currently, it is not known whether changes in the hydrodynamic conditions of the reactor could influence the anaerobic production of hydrogen. Among the hydrodynamic parameters that can be studied is the upflow velocity (V up). It is know that high velocities can favor mass transfer among phases in anaerobic digestion. Otherwise, few studies deal with this subject. Wu et al. [2] found that the higher the velocity applied to an AFBR, the greater the hydrogen production; however, they found no influence on the hydrogen yield. In a study of fluidized-bed reactors it is essential to know the upflow velocity that fluidizes the bed so that can be understood how far from this value an operation should be taken. According to the support material used, this information can be acquired. Other parameters like degrees of packaging can lead to differences in hydrogen production, like Lin et al. [17] have evaluated. The higher the degree of packaging, the smaller is the V up applied. Although the use of an AFBR for hydrogen production was effective, studies on the best range of processing conditions for operating the reactor are necessary before AFBRs can be applied to full-scale hydrogen production. Therefore, in order to achieve a better understanding of the behavior of AFBRs for producing hydrogen, we have conducted a study to determine the influence of applying upflow velocity during hydrogen production using synthetic wastewater containing glucose as the carbon source (5000mgL−1)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Anaerobic reactors,"2.1 Anaerobic reactors Two fluidized-bed reactors were used in this study (Fig. 1 ). They were constructed from acrylic and had an internal diameter of 5.3cm and a height of 190cm, making a total volume working of 4192cm3. Fluidization was maintained with a recirculating pump, and the feed was introduced with a peristaltic pump. The reactors were operated in a continuous mode for 217 days using expanded clay for immobilization support. Expanded clay (diameter=2.8–3.35mm; density=1.50gcm−3; minimum fluidization velocity: V mf =1.24cms−1) was chosen because it provides support, it is inert and it has physical characteristics such as roughness and porosity that are beneficial for microorganism deposits. The support occupied 60% of the reactor (bed height=115cm). After fluidization, R124 reached 129cm and R188 reached 144cm. Inoculum adaptation for the reactors was completed in batch mode for 48h. After this period, the reactors were placed in continuous mode. Both reactors started operating under a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8h, which decreased until an HRT of 1h was reached. The change from one stage to another was performed such that the data obtained on hydrogen production and glucose conversion was stabilized."
3,Synthetic wastewater,2.2 Synthetic wastewater The reactors were fed with a synthetic wastewater that contained glucose at a concentration of 5000mgL−1. The nutrient concentrations were as follows (in mgL−1): CO(NH2)2 (125); NiSO4·6H2O (1); FeSO4·7H2O (5); FeCl3·6H2O (0.5); CaCl2·6H2O (47.0); CoCl2·2H2O (0.08); SeO (0.07); KH2PO4 (85.0); K2HPO4 (21.7); Na2HPO4·2H2O (33.4). Hydrochloric acid (30%) and sodium bicarbonate (0.84gL−1) were also added to buffer the solution and avoid sudden changes in pH and maintain the pH inside the reactor between 4 and 5. The volume of HCl (30%) that was used corresponded to 1mL of acid solution per liter of wastewater prepared.
4,Inoculum,"2.3 Inoculum The sludge from a UASB reactor that was used for treatment of swine wastewater served as the inoculum for both reactors. Before inoculation, the sludge underwent a heat treatment to activate acidogenic cells according to the methodology of Kim et al. [22]. It consisted of heating the sludge for 10min at 90°C, followed by an ice bath until the temperature reached 25°C. A ratio of 7.5% by volume was used for inoculating the reactors."
5,Start-up procedure,"2.4 Start-up procedure In order to analyze the influence of the upflow velocity (V up), two different V up were applied to each reactor: 1.24 and 1.88cms−1. The reactors were named based on the velocity at which they were operated. R124 is the reactor with V up of 1.24cms−1, and R188 is the reactor with V up of 1.88cms−1. Table 1 shows the hydrodynamic conditions applied to each reactor."
6,Chemical analysis,"2.5 Chemical analysis Concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and alcohols were also measured by gas chromatography (GC-2010, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with FID and COMBI-PAL headspace injection (AOC 5000 model) as well as a HP-INNOWAX column (30m×0.25mm i.d.×0.25μm film thickness) [23]. The biogas hydrogen content was determined by gas chromatography (GC-2010, Shimadzu, Japan) using TCD with argon as the carrier gas and a column packed with Supelco Carboxen 1010 Plot (30m×0.53mm i.d.) [23]. A gas meter (TG1; Ritter Inc., Germany) was used to quantify the amount of hydrogen generated. Glucose concentration was measured with an enzymatic GOD-PAP [18]. The chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were analyzed according to Standard Methods [24]. The attached biomass was measured according to Chen and Chen [25]. Quantification of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) in protein form was performed in accordance with the method proposed by Lowry et al. [26] and modified by Peterson [27], using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Analysis of EPSs in carbohydrate form was carried out according to the methods of Dubois et al. [28] using lactose as a standard."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Glucose conversion,"3.1 Glucose conversion Fig. 2 illustrates the glucose conversion achieved by the two reactors that were operated with different HRTs. The glucose conversion was above 80% in both reactors, R124 and R188, and it reached a maximum of 94.3% at an HRT of 6h in R188. The results remained relatively constant throughout the experiment until an HRT of 2h was reached. Because of the change in the HRT from 2 to 1h, there was a decrease in glucose conversion in both reactors. The glucose conversion was stable between an HRT of 2 and 8h. Until an HRT of 2h was reached, R188, which was operated with a V up of 1.88cms−1, had an average conversion that was 9% higher than R124 (1.24cms−1). At an HRT of 2h, R124 became the reactor with a higher conversion. With an HRT of 1h, there was a decrease in the conversion for both reactors. This decrease in glucose conversion at an HRT of 1h showed that for low hydraulic retention times, higher values of glucose degradation were not possible. The adoption of V up of 1.88cms−1, which was 1.5-fold higher than V mf in this experiment (1.24cms−1), improved the mixing conditions inside the reactor and diminished the resistance to mass transfer between the liquid and the inner surface of the biofilm. Furthermore, the incremental increase in V up implied that an increase in the bed height occurred as a result of its expansion. The interstitial space between the particles of the bed, along with higher turbulent conditions, could improve the parameters of mass transfer involved in the diffusion of the substrate within the biofilm. However, to confirm this hypothesis, mass transfer experiments should be completed in order to evaluate the change in parameters under different configurations. This reversal of the results from both reactors may be related to other issues, such as the presence of a dominant microbial culture or better adaptation of the reactor. Overall, the results showed that the two different operating conditions yielded efficient substrate conversion; the results for both reactors were above 80%. This finding confirmed previous studies on AFBRs in which the conversion values were around 90%. Lin et al. [13] achieved conversions between 92% and 98% from sucrose. Zhang et al. [14], who worked with glucose and AFBR, reached conversions of 99.47% with an HRT of 4h and 71.44% with an HRT of 0.5h. Shida et al. [18] achieved conversions between 92.06% and 98.08%. Amorim et al. [19], who also used an AFBR, obtained conversions above 90%. Lin et al. [17] achieved conversions of 97% with HRTs of 6 and 4h, as well as 72% with an HRT of 2h. Barros et al. [20] achieved conversions between 70.50% and 96.30%. These results were consistent with previous research on the anaerobic fluidized-bed reactor."
9,Hydrogen production,"3.2 Hydrogen production The data obtained on the production of hydrogen in this study are presented in Figs. 3–5 . Fig. 3 shows the amount of H2 formed in the biogas for different HRTs. The amount of H2 formed reached a maximum value at an HRT of 8h but decreased when the HRT was changed to 6h. For an HRT of 4, 2 and 1h, the H2 content remained relatively stable. Only H2 and CO2 were produced. CH4 was not produced during the experiment. At an HRT of 8h, R124 and R188 showed a H2 content of 67.57% and 61.82%, respectively. With an HRT of 6h, the H2 content fell to 43.03% and 40.60%. When the HRT was changed to 2 and 4h, there was a small change to a minimum of 36.04% for R124 at an HRT of 2h. At an HRT of 1h, a slight increase was observed in R124 and R188, which reached a 40.53% and 41.54% H2 content, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, the upflow velocity had no influence on the H2 content in the biogas. However, Spagni et al. [29] studied the effect of varying organic loading rates (OLRs) on hydrogen production and found that higher organic loads led to a decrease in the amount of H2 in the biogas, despite the increasing hydrogen production rate. The hydrogen production rate (HPR) and the OLR for each HRT are illustrated in Fig. 4. As long as the HRT decreased, the hydrogen production rate increased for both reactors. Since the substrate concentration was fixed throughout the experiment in both reactors, the reduction in the HRT led to an increase in OLR. With a high OLR, it was expected that more hydrogen should be produced. The reactors generated similar values at the beginning of the operation when both reactors had an HRT of 8h. In response to a decrease to an HRT of 6h, R188 remained stable, while R124 showed an increase in HPR. With further reduction in the HRT to 4, 2 and 1h, the HPR in the reactors increased. The maximum HPR was achieved at an HRT of 1h. The reactor that had the highest HPR, R124 (1.22Lh−1 L−1), was operated with V mf. Reactor R188, with V up that was 1.5-fold higher, had a lower HPR (0.93Lh−1 L−1) and a peak value that was 1.3-fold smaller than the productivity for R124. In a previous study on AFBRs, the HPR values had a range between 1.80 and 2.36Lh−1 L−1. Lin et al. [13] obtained values around 2.27Lh−1 L−1, while Zhang et al. [14] obtained values around 2.36Lh−1 L−1. Lin et al. [17] reached 1.80Lh−1 L−1. When we discuss in terms of organic loading rate, it can be seen that when the OLR was above 132.6kgCODm−3 d−1, the growth rate of hydrogen production decreased and stabilized. Thus, increasing the organic load to levels above 132.6kgCODm−3 d−1 had no effect on the production of hydrogen under the experimental conditions applied in this study. Fig. 5 illustrates the hydrogen yield (HY) related to the substrate degradation and OLR for each reactor at different HRTs. When the HRT was reduced, the average HY increased in both reactors. The HY varied between 0.9 and 2.6molH2 mol−1 glucose for an HRT of 2h. At an HRT of 1h, there was a decrease in the HY for both reactors. Similar to the change in HPR, the HY values increased as the HRT decreased until an HRT of 2h was reached. The best HY values were obtained at an HRT of 2h for both reactors, which was similar to the trend for HPR values. However, at HRTs of 8 and 6h, R188 had a better HY than R124. At an HRT of 1h, the effect of the V up was not verified because of the similarity between the results. There was also a drop in the HY for both reactors at an HRT of 1h. The V up of 1.88cms−1 (R188) did not influence the hydrogen yield obtained in the reactor operated at V up of 1.24cms−1 (R124). The maximum HY in R124 (2.55molH2 mol−1 glucose) was 18% higher than the yield obtained with R188 (2.16molH2 mol−1 glucose). Likewise, the maximum HPR in R124 (1.22Lh−1 L−1) was 30% higher than the HPR for R188 (0.93Lh−1 L−1). Additionally, at an HRT above 6h, the hydrogen yield tended to be better when the reactor was operated at a lower V up. During reactor operation with a low HRT, there was a better performance of the reactor operated at high V up. Wu et al. [2] studied the influence of V up and did not observe a clear effect of the superficial velocity on the hydrogen yield. An increase of 33% in the velocity (from 0.55 to 0.73cms−1) led to a decrease in yield by 58% (from 1.04 to 0.44molH2 mol−1 glucose). When there was a 25% increase in V up (from 0.73 to 0.91cms−1), unlike the previous result, an increase greater than 100% in the HY was observed. Operating a reactor at a low HRT requires smaller V up because of the greater mixing conditions that exist compared with operating a reactor at a high HRT. Reactor operation at low HRTs requires higher upflow velocities in order to circumvent the lowest agitation conditions for the medium in the reactor. In this experiment, that behavior was not observed. In the same way, a reasonable explanation can be taken from the OLR applied to the system. The HY increased when the OLR increased. However, when the OLR exceeded 60kgCODm−3 d−1, the increase was small and a relatively constant HY occurred with increasing OLRs. Ren et al. [30] also verified an increase in the specific hydrogen production and in the HY when the organic loading rate varied from 6.32 to 68.21kgCODm−3 d−1. At 68.21kgCODm−3 d−1, hydrogen production declined because of the accumulation of volatile fatty acids in the system. As noted, the data that were obtained were similar to results from previous studies in the literature. Although there is currently no consensus on the real reasons for the reduction in the HY as the result of high OLRs, the yield may be inhibited by high organic loads. Several studies have observed these effects [31,32], yet other studies have shown that increasing the OLR can lead to higher hydrogen production yields [13,22]. We found that there was a limit point for producing hydrogen. After that point was reached, the HPR and the HY remained constant because of the continued increase in the organic loading rate applied. This trend was also observed by Van Ginkel and Logan [32] and Kramer et al. [33]. Van Ginkel and Logan [32] attributed this trend to an inhibition caused by organic acids nondissociated in the medium. These acids would act by inhibiting the hydrogenase enzyme that was responsible for producing hydrogen. However, Kramer et al. [33] stated that the acids were not the only compounds responsible for this inhibition. Their argument was that the reduction in HY was accompanied by a reduction in the quantities of acids that were produced. Another issue, raised by Van Ginkel and Logan [32], was the low concentration of hydrogen that occurred with low OLRs. This hypothesis suggested that there would be no limitation on hydrogen production because there would be no inhibition of hydrogenase. However, low concentrations would be necessary in order for there to be significant changes in the thermodynamics involved with hydrogenase [33]. Table 2 provides a comparative analysis of the HPR, the HY and the biogas content from previous studies using AFBRs for hydrogen production. The results shown in Table 2 are the maximum values obtained from each study. The table also contains the values for the V up employed in those studies. The HPR in AFBRs varied between 0.93 and 2.36Lh−1 L−1, but Zhang et al. [14] reached productivity values of 7.60Lh−1 L−1. The HY was between 0.44 and 2.55molH2 mol−1 glucose (11–64% of the theoretical maximum from glucose through the acetic pathway), between 0.51 and 4.98molH2 mol−1 sucrose (6–62% of the theoretical maximum from sucrose through the acetic pathway) and between 0.09 and 0.51molH2 mol−1 fructose (2–12% of the theoretical maximum from fructose through the acetic pathway) in a study by Wu et al. [2]. With the exception of fructose, the results for glucose and sucrose were in the same range of hydrogen yield. The optimum HRTs, which varied among the different studies, is also displayed in Table 2. Studies by Shida et al. [18], Amorim et al. [19] and Barros et al. [20] had a large HPR for an HRT of 1h that was similar to our experiments with R124 and R188. In contrast, studies by Zhang et al. [14] and Zhang et al. [15] demonstrated optimum production at HRTs of 0.5 and 0.25h, respectively. Optimal HPRs were achieved at a higher HRT by Wu et al. [2], Koskinen et al. [3] and Lin et al. [17], who achieved their best rates an HRT of 2, 3.1 and 2h, respectively. However, with the exception of Wu et al. [12], all of the studies found the best productivity for the shortest HRTs. A conjoint analysis of the studies is presented in Table 2. The analysis showed that the velocity applied to the reactors in this study had a positive effect on HPR until a velocity of 1.61cms−1 was reached, which was the same upflow velocity applied by Shida et al. [18], Amorim et al. [19] and Barros et al. [20]. At V up of 1.88cms−1, there was a decrease in hydrogen production. This analysis took into consideration the fact that the same support materials (expanded clay) and the same substrates (glucose) were used in those studies. However, Zhang et al. [14], who worked with V up of 2.08cms−1, obtained a HPR of 2.36Lh−1 L−1, which was the largest among the studies shown in Table 2. Thus, despite the influence of V up on the parameters of hydrogen production, the use of different support materials should be taken into account because the support materials modify the fluidization level in the fluidized reactor. Table 2 shows that hydrogen production improved when V up increased. Regarding the results for HY and the biogas content, it was not possible to verify the influent characteristic of applying different V up from the studies available in the literature. There may also be an upflow velocity limit for acceptable hydrogen production from microorganisms in the reactors operated by Shida et al. [18], Amorim et al. [19] and Barros et al. [20]. At a velocity of 1.61cms−1, which was the V up applied in those studies (and the same operational conditions used in the current study) and which corresponded to a velocity that was 1.3-fold larger than V mf, the reactors had a similar HY to the yield obtained in this study for R124, the reactor that was operated with V mf. Perhaps this gap between the V mf and 1.3 V mf is the best operation range for AFBRs such that controlled hydrogen production can occur without production inhibition. The application of high superficial velocities maintained good mixing conditions inside the reactor [2]. Furthermore, the high superficial velocities allowed the biogas that was produced to be easily removed. Kraemer and Bagley [34] observed the effect of H2 saturation when they investigated using nitrogen aspersion to dilute the concentration of H2 in the reaction media for batch reactors. The HY increased from 1.3 to 1.8molH2 mol−1 glucose. However, the authors stated that the yield improved as a result of diluting the concentration of the substrate; the aspersion was not able to affect the levels of dissolved H2 present in the media. It is believed that a high concentration of hydrogen in the reaction media may inhibit the production of new biogas. In contrast, when the reactor is operated at a high superficial velocity, biomass detachment can occur, which could lead to a reduction in the microbial community inside the reactor. Consequently, hydrogen production decreases. However, in regard to H2 saturation, new experimental tests would have to be carried out so that the factors involved in mass transfer and the influence of dissolved biogas could be evaluated. In order to study the limits of H2 production based on saturation of the media, Kraemer and Bagley [33,34] conducted an experiment to examine of the influence of sprayed nitrogen on the mass transfer parameters. The authors studied the optimum range of the N2 spraying rate so that there would be an increase in the hydrogen yield. However, the authors argued that the application of nitrogen aspersion to full-scale hydrogen production would be an important cost factor because it requires more energy to perform the aspersion."
10,Production of organic acids and alcohols,"3.3 Production of organic acids and alcohols In order to evaluate the effect of the HRT on the production of metabolites for each reactor, the ratio of each metabolite over the sum of all soluble metabolite products (SMP) formed was calculated. Table 3 shows the molar distribution of the major metabolites produced in the reactors for each HRT that was studied. The main metabolites were ethanol (EtOH) and acetic acid (HAc), which represented 80% of the metabolites formed at certain stages of the experiment. The presence of butyric acid (HBu), propionic acid (HPr) and methanol (MetOH) was also reported. Regarding the data obtained from R124 with V mf, there was a predominance of ethanol over other metabolites. For all the HRTs, the EtOH molar percent was over 50% of the SMP. The maximum EtOH percentage occurred at HRTs of 2 and 1h when the percentage reached 68.7% of the SMP. The minimum percentage occurred at an HRT of 4, which was 46.9% of the SMP. The HAc production was relatively constant for HRTs of 8, 6 and 4h (19.4%, 20.6% and 24.7% of the SMP) and fell to 12% at HRTs of 2 and 1h. HBu decreased as the HRT decreased; it is possible that it was washed from the reactor during the decrease in the HRT. MetOH remained between 4.1% and 8.1% of the SMP, while propionic acid was between 3.28% and 15.6% of the SMP. For R188, also shown in Table 3, a large EtOH presence, ranging between 49.3% and 58.8% of the SMP, was observed for each HRT. There was no variation in EtOH production when the HRT was changed. The HAc production also remained relatively constant and ranged between 11.8% and 27.1% of the SMP. Unlike other studies in the literature, the MetOH presence was relevant in this experiment. At an HRT of 8h, MetOH production accounted for 22.6% of the SMP then fell to 19.3%, 11.4%, 11.1% and 19.2% of the SMP as the HRT decreased. The production of both HBu and HPr acid did not exceed 9% of the SMP. Higher amounts of ethanol occurred at HRTs for which the hydrogen production was maximal (an HRT of 2h). This fact demonstrated the possibility that there is another metabolic pathway where there is no competition between the formation of ethanol and hydrogen. R124 reached its best hydrogen yield at an HRT of 2h. The HAc/HBu ratio increased in both R124 and R188 after the change of the HRT from 8 to 2h, as shown in Table 3. Although the HAc/HBu ratio shows that hydrogen production is favored, other factors may be involved in the high ethanol production observed in this study. In fact, the largest HAc/HBu ratio was obtained at the HRTs for which the HPR and the HY were higher. However, the amounts of HAc and HBu were lower than those amounts obtained by Shida et al. [18], Amorim et al. [19] and Barros et al. [20], which are shown in Table 4 . These studies were conducted with same substrate (glucose) and used expanded clay particles that were the same size as the ones used in the current study. The HAc/EtOH ratio, which reflects the preference for the formation of solvents, ranged between 0.18 and 0.53 for R124 and between 0.20 and 0.55 for R188. So, the lower the ratio, the greater the production of solvents. Koskinen et al. [16] also reported high ethanol production in a study of a pure culture of thermophilic bacteria that were isolated for hydrogen production in an AFBR. They also found HAc/EtOH values between 0.27 and 0.38. Wu et al. [31] pointed out that HAc/HBu that may not be the only parameter for indicating the efficiency of hydrogen production. According to authors of other previous studies, the higher the HAc/Hbu ratio, the lower the production of hydrogen. In the current study, however, we verified that the higher the ratio, the greater the hydrogen production, but there was also a high production of ethanol that had no effect on hydrogen production in fluidized reactors. In Table 2, it is clear that the HPRs and HYs were similar to those obtained by other authors who were using the same reactor and the same substrate. Wu et al. [31] suggested in their study that these results occurred because of the different fermentation pathways used by the microorganisms. Skonieczny and Yargeau [35] affirmed that the ethanol production agreed with experiments on anaerobic fermentation, but the high ethanol concentrations that were obtained showed a new direction in the biological production of hydrogen. Despite the competition that ethanol production generated in the system, we cannot ignore the possibility of different metabolic pathways in which there is no inhibition of hydrogen production. Zhu et al. [36] justified the study in which ethanol was produced along with high levels of H2 by suggesting a pathway in which the production of hydrogen could benefit from ethanol production. One of their suggestions was the following: (1) C6H12O6 +H2O→C2H5OH+CH3COOH+2H2 +2CO2 In Eq. (1), ethanol production occurs concomitantly with the production of acetic acid and ethanol. For each mole of glucose that is degraded, 1mol of EtOH, 1mol of HAc and 2mol of H2 were formed. Similar to the results of the current study, the main metabolites that were obtained were HAc and EtOH. Thus, the equation suggested by Zhu et al. [36] may be one of the pathways that were involved in the present experiments. Another study performed by Fang and Liu [37] on the effect of pH on hydrogen production assumed that a change in the metabolic pathway would occur because of the influence of pH on the microbial community. Likewise, Zhu et al. [36] showed that for a pH below 5.5, the pathway that produces acetic acid is favored, along with an ethanol pathway. At higher pH values, the authors found that all of these pathways acted concurrently in conjunction with the propionic pathway. In the present study, pH control was performed by adding NaHCO3 and HCl, which allowed the pH to be maintained between 4.5 and 5. The pH chosen for R124 and R188 was in the pH range for the ethanol and acetic pathways that was suggested by Liu and Fang [37] and Zhu et al. [36], and the range worked well. Another study in which ethanol fermentation was predominant was carried out by Ren et al. [30]. The authors noted that there was a large production of metabolites that formed in accordance with the OLR. Thus, a higher OLR applied to the reactor led to a higher production of metabolites, especially EtOH and HAc. This ratio increased until a point was reached at which there was a decrease in the production of acids and alcohols. However, according to the available literature, large amounts of metabolites can inhibit the metabolic activities performed by the cell. So, according to the authors, when a reactor was subjected to high organic loads, acid and CO2 saturation occurred and possibly inhibited the production. Overall, R124 and R188 had a predominant ethanol-type production pathway. Alternative pathways for ethanol production were likely engaged because the traditional pathway (Eq. (2)) does not generate H2. Furthermore, it was verified that it is possible to produce ethanol and hydrogen concurrently when specific conditions, such as low pH, are met. (2) C6H12O6 →CH3CH2OH+2CO2 In order to analyze the production of ethanol in a quantitative way, the EtOH yield was calculated using calculations similar to the ones for HY. Thus, the yield was calculated as a mol of ethanol formed per mol of glucose consumed, as illustrated in Fig. 6 . In Fig. 6, there was a slight increase in ethanol yield when the HRT was reduced in both reactors. At HRTs of 8 and 4h, the ethanol yields were similar. At an HRT of 2h, there was a higher tendency for ethanol to form in R124. Table 4 shows the variation of the ethanol yield in multiple studies in terms of certain variables such as upflow velocity, HRT, organic loading and pH. Wu et al. [2] varied the V up from 0.55 to 0.73cms−1 using three different substrates: glucose, sucrose and fructose. There was an increase in EtOH yield for all three substrates in response to an increase in V up. In contrast, Zhang et al. [14] found that varying the HRT produced a reduction in the V up. In the present study, R124 and R188 had an increased EtOH yield when the HRT decreased. Koskinen et al. [16] also studied the influence of pH on the EtOH yield and found that at a pH of 6.9, a maximum ethanol yield of 0.28molEtOHmol−1 glucose was achieved. The effect of the upflow velocity in R124 and R188 on the metabolites that were formed cannot be described conclusively because the hydrogen production did not show a trend for this variable. However, from previous studies by our group, some questions about the subject can be answered. Table 5 illustrates the distribution of metabolites formed in AFBRs as described in published papers. All of the studies in the table used the same inoculum source and underwent the same heat treatment. The metabolite distributions obtained in this study were different from the ones obtained by Shida et al. [18], Amorim et al. [19] and Barros et al. [20]. There was no trend in the formation of specific metabolites when the upflow velocity in the reactors was changed. Although the compatibility of data for hydrogen production was verified, there was significant variation between the metabolites generated by R124 and R188 as well as those presented by Shida et al. [18], Amorim et al. [19] and Barros et al. [20]. These results contribute to the hypothesis that a different pathway exists for ethanol production because there was no reduction in hydrogen production. Still, when all of the experiments were analyzed from Shida et al. [18], in which the glucose concentration was 2000mgL−1 without an alkaline control; Amorim et al. [19], who worked with a glucose concentration of 4000mgL−1 with the addition of an alkaline agent; Barros et al. [20], who also worked with a glucose concentration of 4000mgL−1, there was a large proportion of acetic acid and butyric acid in the experiments from the literature and relatively low amounts of ethanol."
11,Extracellular polymers and attached biomass,"3.4 Extracellular polymers and attached biomass Extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) produced by cells were quantified in terms of protein and carbohydrates. The polymers produced by cells are polysaccharides. These polymers represent most of the visible biomass in bioreactors. Nutrient limitation or changes in the microbial community could lead to the production of exopolysaccharides [38]. Fig. 7 shows the production of polymers for each of the reactors. The control of protein production is important because the accumulation of exopolysaccharides in the biofilm structure could limit the effects of mass transfer from the liquid to the bulk. Microorganisms start to synthesize exopolysaccharides in situations in which there are limited nutrients to maintain cellular activity. As shown in Fig. 7, R188 achieved a higher EPSs production compared with R124 for all HRTs, except for the 4h HRT. Still, a lower HRT resulted in lower EPSs production in R188. Increasing the mixing conditions could have led to changes in cellular metabolism that led to hydrogen production instead of EPSs production. Fig. 8 shows the amount of EPSs in the form of carbohydrates that adhered to the immobilization support. The presence of carbohydrates showed that there was a direct relationship between polymers and the HRT; however, this relationship could not be verified because of the operational conditions that were used in this study. The HY tended to increase the mass of the carbohydrates excreted from the cells in both of the reactors. During the experiment, more EPSs were released in the form of carbohydrates when the hydrogen production in the reactor was low. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the reactor that had the highest excretion of carbohydrates was R188. Recalling the values from the hydrogen production rate, the same profile was observed for the hydrogen production, but in reverse order, with the R124 showing better production of hydrogen. We assumed that a portion of the carbohydrates that were measured were present because of the synthetic wastewater that was used in the experiment. High concentrations of carbohydrates on the surface of the biofilm may have led the substrate to penetrate the biofilm. Taking this possibility into account, the gradient of the concentration between the reaction media and the particle surface was low. A larger amount of carbohydrates in the reticular network of the biofilm would lead to lower feed rates, and only a small amount of substrate would be required for hydrogen production. Another factor that may have contributed to the production of polymers is a high concentration of substrate [39]. The EPSs production is required to maintain cell activity. Thus, exopolysaccharides are formed in order to maintain cell activity. Therefore, it was assumed that for reactors in which the V up was small, the mixing conditions were not favorable for the penetration of nutrients through the biofilm layer. As the degree of turbulence rose because of the increasing V up in the reactor, there may have been an improvement in the parameters of mass transfer as well as better transit of the biofilm/substrate. So, organisms might direct their metabolism towards the production of hydrogen instead of towards cellular maintenance. However, this is not a conclusive finding because no mass transfer tests were performed to evaluate these specific parameters. Fig. 9 compares the biomass growth on the particles according to the HRT. R188 had the highest values of attached biomass. In general, there was biomass growth that paralleled the increase in the HRT, which demonstrates the efficiency of the particle chosen as a support material for microbial attachment. However, this biomass growth occurred until an HRT of 2h was reached. Afterwards, there was a decrease in biomass attached to the particles for both R124 and R188. Higher turbulent conditions inside the reactor at a low HRT possibly caused the biomass detachment. Rabah et al. [40] warned of this condition when they conducted an experiment on biomass detachment. The authors noted that increasing the superficial velocity led to an increase in shear stress. This increase, in turn, caused a high rate of detachment for the biofilm."
12,Conclusions,"The present study showed the applicability of AFBRs for hydrogen production. The results showed that an increase in the V up has not been effect to increase the hydrogen yield neither the hydrogen production rate. And it is suggested that it should have a point till the velocity maximize the hydrogen production in AFBRs using expanded clay as support material. The reactor under the V mf (R124) had a maximum HPR of 1.22Lh−1 L−1 and a HY of 2.55molH2 mol−1 glucose at an HRT of 2h. The biogas content was between 40.53% and 67.57%, and no methane was formed. EtOH represented almost 80% of the metabolites that were formed. HAc was also produced. We suggested that an alternative metabolic pathway prevailed during the experiment because both reactors had a high production of EtOH. The EPSs production was related to the velocity in the reactor such that a higher V up would lead to low EPSs production. Changes in cellular maintenance could have led to this relationship. Also, when the velocity was higher, more biomass adhered to the support material."
