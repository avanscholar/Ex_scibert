0,Introduction,"Fermentation is one the first steps of residues decomposition by microorganisms. In this step, hydrogen is the most desired coproduct for being a versatile energy carrier used for fossil fuel refining and production of chemicals, including biofuels (IEA, 2019). Other coproducts of industrial interests such as short- and medium-chain organic acids, alcohols and solvents can also be obtained through fermentation process which makes it an ideal multipurpose technology (Borin et al., 2019; Luongo et al., 2019; Mota et al., 2018). In general terms, fermentation technology comprises a cascade of reactions which are primarily related to the production and consumption of hydrogen, considering a fermentative system using non-sterile mixed cultures (Levin et al., 2004). In that case, high production of hydrogen is associated to the mixture of acetate and butyrate fermentation route end-products whilst its low production is associated to other reduced end-products such as acetone, butanol, ethanol and lactate (Ferraz, 2013). Finally, hydrogen consumption is reported in methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis routes. These reactions will be reported in depth in section 3 .6. The success of fermentative systems is allied to multiple factors (substrate-type, temperature, pH, inoculum, regime operation) which are interrelated (Akhlaghi et al., 2017; Koyama et al., 2016a). The operating pH (controlled along the process) is an important individual-factor in fermentative systems. It indicates the hydrolysis and fermentation degree; determines the activity of hydrogenase and the metabolic routes (Kim et al., 2011). Extreme high pH values can negatively affect the activity of hydrogen-producing microorganisms as well as extreme low pH values can result in inhibition of the hydrogenase activity (Mohd Yasin et al., 2011) diverting the corresponded pathways to the production of solvents (i.e., alcohols) (Fuess et al., 2018). Similarly, the relative concentration of active biomass (inoculum) in the system and the substrate available to be consumed is expressed as food-to-microorganisms (F/M) ratio. This ratio can shift from substrate-limited to substrate-sufficient growth but also to substrate-excess unbalancing the anabolic and catabolic reactions and, thus, affecting the yield of substrate conversion into by-products (Akhlaghi et al., 2017; Liu, 1996). Different wastes and wastewaters have been used as feedstock in fermentative systems including agricultural and food industry wastewater, lignocellulosic biomass and organic fraction of municipal solid waste (Castelló et al., 2020). However, some feedstock can present undesirable features or even a nutritional deficit which may affect the process to proceed properly. For instance, algal biomass has been adopted as the main carbon source for sewage sludge fermentation in order to dilute the inherent inhibitors to the latter residue (Yin et al., 2021). Similarly, rich-protein substrate (microalgae) and rich-carbohydrate substrate (macroalgae and rice residues) have been used as mixed substrate to achieve better ratios of carbon-nitrogen and improve the performance of fermentative organic acids and hydrogen production (Sun et al., 2018; Xia et al., 2016). The simultaneous fermentation of two or more residues, also known as co-fermentation, might represent an alternative to mitigate the aforementioned drawbacks (Grosser and Neczaj, 2018; Yang et al., 2019) and increase the production of target products. Cheese whey (CW) is a residual nutrient-rich liquid stream from dairies industries that has been extensively studied to fermentative purposes (Basak et al., 2018; Lovato et al., 2018; Rao and Basak, 2021). However, hydrogen production instability and process inhibition by accumulation of organic acids have been reported and attributed to its lack of alkalinity (low pH) and high organic matter concentration, respectively (Fernández et al., 2014; Lovato et al., 2018, 2021). Yerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis) waste (YMW) is one the most important lignocellulosic residue in Southern Cone of Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay) and after its thermal-alkaline pretreatment might be a co-substrate for CW fermentation able to increase bioproducts production. The thermal-alkaline pretreated YMW presents a high pH (13.1 ± 0.6) (Ferraz et al., 2020a,b) and might be able to “buffer” the system by increasing the pH to suitable values of fermentative process without additional costs with alkalis. Co-fermentation of CW and YMW for biohydrogen and/or short- and medium-chain organic acids production has not been described in any literature before, therefore, it represents a novelty and the aim of this study. The design of experiments (DoE) was used as a systematic method to investigate fundamentals factors of the process (initial pH, concentration of inoculum and YMW) in batch-mode to attain the production of hydrogen and/or short- and medium- chain organic acids. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology was also performed to assess the microbial community dominant in the co-fermenting system."
1,Material and methods,
2,Substrates: cheese whey (CW - substrate) and Yerba Mate Waste (YMW – co-substrate),"2.1 Substrates: cheese whey (CW - substrate) and Yerba Mate Waste (YMW – co-substrate) Cheese Whey (CW) was collected from an artisanal cheese producer (daily milk production of 6000–9000 L.d−1) in Uruguay. Yerba Mate Waste (YMW) was used as a co-substrate. Briefly, YMW was thermal-alkaline pretreated to unlock the carbohydrates/sugar prior to co-fermentation. The composition of substrate and co-substrate are depicted in Table 1 . Details about YMW generation and the pretreatment conditions are presented in Ferraz et al. (2020a,b)."
3,Inoculum,"2.2 Inoculum Organic compost was used as inoculum (T.Res.Or, Montevideo, Uruguay). According to the manufacturer’s information the compost presents a pH of 7.2, the moisturize content of 25.1 %, and TVS of 35 %."
4,Box-Wilson Central Composite Design (CCD – 2k) with center point repetition,"2.3 Box-Wilson Central Composite Design (CCD – 2k) with center point repetition Central Composite Designs (CCD) was chosen as the experimental design for evaluating all combinations of all factor-levels of each factor (Box and Wilson, 1951) thus, enabling the estimation of all factors and their interactions in the process of biohydrogen production from co-fermentation of CW and YMW. Design levels were determined. Three independent variables, namely YMW concentration (X1), pH (X2) and inoculum concentration (X3) were studied resulting in five levels: CCD (±1), center point (0) and axial points (±α) with 3 repetitions at the center point. The values were assumed based on practical values of solid waste management, reports of biohydrogen production with and without pH control (Bina et al., 2019; Koyama et al., 2016b; Mota et al., 2018) and practical values of reactors inoculation in relation to its working volume (Table 2 ). The number of experiments performed was given by Eq. 1. Axial points were given by Eq. 2. (1) n = 2 k + 2k + m Where n is the number of experiments, k is the number of variables and m is the number of replicates of the center point by “genuine repetition”. (2) α = 2 k 4 Eq. 3 was used to decode α value to access the experimental values of the variables to be studied. (3) α = z i - z ¯ Δ z 2 Where α is the coded value of axial point, z i is the experimental value of the level, z ¯ is the average between the lower (-) and higher (+) value of the level which is exactly the value of level zero (0) and Δ z is the difference between the lower (-) and higher (+). The coefficients were obtained using the method of least squares. Linear models were used to evaluate the influence of all the experimental variables of interest and the interaction effects on the response, according to Eq. 4. (4) Y = b0 + b1 X1 + b2 X2 + b3 X3 + b12 X1 X2 + b13 X1 X3 + b23 X2 X3 + e Where Y is the predicted response (hydrogen yield – H2Y, in mmol H2. g−1 VS added); b0 is a constant (average value average of all observations); b1, b2 and b3 are the linear coefficients for the dependent variables (X1, X2 and X3, respectively); X1, X2 and X3 are the variables (YMW concentration, pH and inoculum concentration, respectively); b12, b13 and b23, are the coefficients for the interactions X12, X13 and X23, respectively; and e is the random error associated with the model. The evaluation of significant effects and coefficients was based on statistical decision using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Student's distribution with p-value of 0.05. The significant factors were selected and a response surface methodology (RSM) was used to predict the optimal region on the surface defined by the factors. In this case, the best values of the variables able to produce the higher amount of biohydrogen."
5,Co-fermentation process of CW and YMW (batch mode),"2.4 Co-fermentation process of CW and YMW (batch mode) Co-fermentation of CW and YMW was performed in batch mode. The experiments were performed in parallel according to Table 2. The mixture of feedstocks was performed at room temperature (20−22 °C). Schott bottles (DURAN® containing a total volume of 500 mL) were flushed with nitrogen gas, sealed with butyl rubber stoppers, and incubated at 37 °C until hydrogen production ceased. Continuous stirring was kept at 150 rpm. The reaction volume was 200 mL. The pH of all experiments was not controlled during co-fermentation process. Accumulated hydrogen production was measured with a gas volume meter (AMPTS II from Bioprocess Control) previously washed in NaOH solution (12 % w/v). Gas production is expressed at standard temperature (0 °C), pressure (1 atm), and zero water–vapor pressure."
6,Chemical analysis,"2.5 Chemical analysis The pH value was measured by using a pH meter (OAKTON pH 11 series). Total reducing sugars (TRS) were determined using the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method (Miller, 1959). Chemical Demand of Oxygen (COD), total solids (TS) and total volatile solids (TVS) were determined according to APHA (2005). Organic acids (C2-C6) were determined by Gas Chromatography equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector (GC/FID) (Adorno et al., 2014). Lactic acid was determined by spectrometry according to Borshchevskaya et al. (Borshchevskaya et al., 2016). Hydrogen (H2), Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) were measured using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu), equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. A packed column was used with the following dimensions 2 m ×1 mm × 1/16 inch. Temperatures of the injection port and the detector were 120 °C. The initial temperature of the oven was 30 °C, and the final temperature of the column was 110 °C with a temperature increase of 35 °C/min. Ar was used as a carrier gas with a pressure of 8 bar."
7,"DNA extraction, PCR amplification and High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) of co-fermentation systems samples","2.6 DNA extraction, PCR amplification and High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) of co-fermentation systems samples Biomass samples were collected from each batch reactor at the end of its operation. However, a composed sample (1:1:1) was generated for the “S.no.” 9, 10 and 11 (replication). 10 ml of samples were centrifuge to separate the biomass (3000 rpm, 10 min) and genomic DNA was extracted with the ZR Soil Microbe DNA MiniPrepTM kit (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA encoding the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR with primers for the bacteria domain: 520 F (5-AYTGGGYDTAAAGNG-3′) and 802R (TACNNGGGTATCTAATCC) (Claesson et al., 2009). Barcodes (10 bp) were added to the amplified 16S rRNA in order to identify the samples after sequencing. The reaction was performed using 1.5 μL of amplified 16S rRNA, 0.5 μL of primers and 12.5 μL of buffer ranger mix (1.5 mM) for a final reaction volume of 25 μL per sample. The conditions were as follow: initial denaturation (95 °C for 5 min), 35 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 30 s), hybridization (55 °C for 30 s), extension (72 °C for 1 min) and final extension (72 °C at 10 min). The tagged amplification was purified using the Zymoclean™ Gel DNA Recovery kit following the manufacturer's protocol. The purified products (tagged amplicons) were sequenced by Ion Torrent PGM technology at Biological Research Institute “Clemente Estable”, Montevideo, Uruguay. The raw reads generated were processed using QIIME software version 1.9.1 (Caporaso et al., 2012, 2011). Low quality reads (coefficient greater than 25) were filtered, trimmed primers, adapters, and barcodes, and reads less than 200 bases in length were eliminated. Chimeras and noise in the sequencing reads were removed leaving high quality reads for the samples. Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTU) using UClust algorithm (Edgar et al., 2011), based on the 97 % identity threshold (de novo-based OTU picking strategy). OTUs represented by one sequence (singletons) were removed from the analysis. Silva database (version 132) was used for the taxonomic classification of the readings with a confidence threshold of 80 %. The raw data was deposited at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under accessing number: PRJNA684595."
8,Calculations and kinetics analysis,"2.7 Calculations and kinetics analysis The volume of substrate, co-substrate, inoculum and the food/microorganism ratio (F/M) were calculated based on the following system of Eq.s (6) and (7): (6) V w = V s + V C S + V I + V h Where, V t is the working or reactional volume (mL), V s is the substrate volume (mL), V C S is the co-substrate volume (mL), V I is the volume of inoculum (mL) and V h is the volume of headspace. (7) F / M = ( V s + V C S ) . C O D i V I . T V S I Where, F/M is commonly given in g−COD. g−1TVS although is expressed as g-O2.L-1. C O D i is the initial COD, T V S I is the total volatile solids of inoculum, in g-TVS. kg-1. The dry apparent specific weight (γ d) assumed was 600 kg.m³. The experimental data from the optimum condition (Section 2.4) was adjusted to the modified Gompertz equation (GM) using the software package Statistica® 8.0 in order to evaluate the kinetics of the co-fermentation process (Eq. 8). (8) P = A c H 2 P . e x p - exp R . e P . λ - t + 1 Where, AcH2P is cumulative hydrogen production expressed in mmol, λ is lag-phase time in d, P is hydrogen production potential also in mL, R is the hydrogen production rate in mM.d−1 and e is exp(l) (i.e., Euler number: 2.71828). The theoretical expected hydrogen production and the acetate produced from homoacetogenesis were calculated using Eq.s (9) and (10) as presented in Ferraz et al., 2020a,b. (9) H 2 t h e o r e t h i c a l = 2 A + 2 B - [ P ] (10) A c e t a t e h o m o a c e t o g e n e s i s = 2 A + 2 B - P - [ H 2 ] 6 Where, [A], [B], [P] and [H2] are the measured acetic, butyric and propionic acidsand the hydrogen concentrations in mM, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using STATISCA 10 previously described in (Ferraz et al., 2020a,b)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Hydrogen yield: variable response,"3.1 Hydrogen yield: variable response Full factorial CCD was employed to determine the individual and interactive effects of thermal-alkaline pretreated Yerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis) waste concentration (YMW, % w/w), pH and inoculum concentration (% w/w) on the co-fermentation process which presented cheese whey (CW) as the main substrate. Table 3 presents the experimental (Y) and predicted response (Ŷ) expressed as hydrogen yield (H2Y). The different conditions evaluated had a strong influence on hydrogen yield. The highest H2Y (1.35 mmolH2. g−1 VS added) were obtained when the concentration of YMW and inoculum were at their higher levels and the pH at its lower. In contrast, the lowest corresponding value (H2Y; 0.31 mmolH2. g−1 VS added) were achieved in absence of YMW and at the lowest concentration of inoculum, indicating that the co-fermentation process was able to increase biohydrogen outputs. The maximum H2Y obtained in the CCD experiments is comparable with data found by other researchers (Table 4 ). Lee et al. (2008) reported much lower H2Y (0.44 mmolH2. g−1 VS added) in batch reactors fed with kitchen vegetable wastes. In another study, Dareioti et al. (2014) observed a H2Y of 1.06 mmol H2·g−1 VS added from the co-fermentation process of olive mill wastewater, cheese whey and cow manure. In turn, Lucas et al. (2015) evaluated the potential to produce hydrogen from cassava starch, dairy and citrus wastes reaching H2Y value of 1.27 mmolH2. g−1 VS added which is similar to the obtained in this study. Exceptionally, Marone et al. (2015) and Basak et al. (2018) reported H2Y values four-times higher (4.98–5.69 mmolH2. g−1 VS added, respectively) than the maximum value observed in this study. The mentioned authors performed an optimization of substrate composition and kinetics studies for hydrogen production from the co-fermentation of agro-industrial residues with cheese whey as common substrate. In terms of hydrogen production, there is no clear set condition for maximizing it, especially regarding the initial pH (uncontrolled pH) that has been reported at values of 5.5 and 7.0. This range is way further concerning lactate (5.5–11.0) and caproate (5.5–8.5) production. In this sense, the fermentation process might be individually optimized via a careful balancing of the different operating conditions, regardless the feedstock, type of reactor and feed mode used (Table 4)."
11,"Co-fermentation process conditions: validation of model, significant effects, and coefficients interactions","3.2 Co-fermentation process conditions: validation of model, significant effects, and coefficients interactions Linear model with interaction among variables (Eq. 4) was performed in order to find out the relationship between responses and process variables of co-fermentation process (Table 5 ). Most of the total response variation around the mean value (b0) was explained by the regression equation (Regression p-value significative at 5% level) and the remainder left as residual (Residual p-value not significance at 5% level). Furthermore, the model was found to be accurate (R2 of 0.72) indicating that more than 70 % of the observed values could be explained by the model. The same model was used to explain the effect of variables on four alkaline pre-treatments of YMW (Ferraz et al., 2020a,b). The authors' reported slightly higher values of R2 (≥0.89) than what was found in this study. This may be due to axial points not being considered in the model, indicating the variable response values were closer to the central point (i.e., greater control of casual variability) but with lower range responses. The factors X1 (YMW concentration) and X3 (inoculum concentration) at the levels studied are significant, indicating that they might be fixed at the lowest value when evaluated individually. Interestingly, the factor X2 (initial pH, i.e., non-controlled pH) had no influence on the co-fermentation process, suggesting that it can be fixed at any value between the two levels. Furthermore, the final pH measured from each batch reactor was between 3.4 and 5.2 regardless of its initial value, indicating that the fermentation products were able to decrease the pH even from its highest level (S. no. 15; pH of 12.7 – Table 2). This finding is also corroborated by Koyama et al. (2016a) who potentially computed the use of industrial effluent in hydrogen-producing systems at its original pH (4.8). Hydrogen production under extreme conditions of pH (2.8 and 10.0) were also reported by Mota et al. (2018) and Li et al. (2020), therfore, being consistent with the current result. Interaction between factors are important for process optimization (Ferraz et al., 2020a,b). The individual interaction X1X2 (YMW concentration and pH) and X1X3 (concentration of YMW and inoculum) were significant. Additionally, the X1X3 interaction had the strongest effect on the process and according to this finding, both variables should be studied at their highest levels for a greater response. The best level of independent variables and their interactions on the co-fermentation process was then evaluated with a response surface plot (Fig. 1 ). By applying linear regression analysis to the experimental results, Eq. 11 was obtained to describe the co-fermentation process of cheese whey and Yerba Mate waste using the uncoded independent variables. (11) H2Y = – 0.002*(YMW)2 – 0.001*(Inoculum)2 + 0.080*(YMW) + 0.088*(Inoculum) – 0.655 In the case, H2Y is the hydrogen yield in mmolH2. g−1 VS added, YMW is the concentration of Yerba Mate in % and Inoculum is the concentration of sludge added to the reactor also in %."
12,Effects of food to microorganisms (F/M) ratios,"3.3 Effects of food to microorganisms (F/M) ratios Different ratios of F/M on hydrogen production from the co-fermentation of CW and YMW were evaluated based on the CCD experiments. The different volumes of mixtures between CW, YWM and inoculum in the batch reactors resulted in F/M ratios of 1.5, 1.8, 2.3, 2.6, 3.6, 5.6 and 9.5 g COD g−1 VS. The highest and lowest values of H2Y of co-fermentation process were archived at F/M ratio of 2.3 and 9.5 g COD g−1 VS, respectively, demonstrating the need for high amounts of inoculum (∼ 20 % w/v) able to convert complex substrates such as lignocellulosic materials in hydrogen. Similar values were observed by Nasr et al. (2011) using thin stillage as substrate. By contrast, higher ratios of F/M (10.6–13.3 g COD g−1 VS) were reported as optimum in hydrogen-producing systems (Basak et al., 2018; Ferraz et al., 2015a). The differences in the optimum F/M ratio in the literature can be attributed to the differences in the waste-type and composition as well as the anaerobic sludges."
13,Kinetic analyses of hydrogen production,"3.4 Kinetic analyses of hydrogen production Kinetics parameters can also describe the performance of processes. Modified Gompertz model was used to describe the best condition for producing hydrogen (S.no. 6; Table 2), considering the co-fermentation of CW and YMW. Concomitantly, the S.no. 12 represented the condition where the CW was used as only substrate for same purpose. To compare such behaviour between samples, it was assumed: (i) no influence of pH as previous discussed (subhead 3.2.) and (ii) low value for the F/M ratio (1.8–2.3 g COD. g−1 VS). The Modified Gompertz model was found to describe the experimental data at an excellent level (R2 > 0.990) for both assays. The co-fermentation process improved the accumulated hydrogen production (AcH2P) and rate (R) in up to 4.5 and 7.5 folds, respectively, compared to the condition without YMW (Fig. 2 ) (Table 6 ). However, the addition of YMW delayed the lag phase by 4.5 h while, in its absence, hydrogen production occurred immediately (Table 5). It is worth mentioning that, after biogas being washed in NaOH solution (12 % w/v), the hydrogen content was superior to 99 % in all reactors throughout the experiment."
14,Short and medium-organic acids: precursor and non-precursor of hydrogen,"3.5 Short and medium-organic acids: precursor and non-precursor of hydrogen The total reducing sugars (TRS) in the medium source is mainly composed of glucose, lactose, xylose and arabinose, as depicted in Castelló et al. (2019) and Ferraz et al. (2020a,b). However, the batch reactor “S. no. 12″ presents only hexoses in the liquid medium, considering the absence of YM in the experiment. The TRS presented an average value of conversion of 93.4 % suggesting that the organic compost provided a microbial community able to consume both pentoses and hexoses (Reactions 1–4) (Tabassum et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2015). Pentose conversion to acetate (Reaction 1) C5H10O5 + 1.8H2O → 1.7CH3COOH + 1.7CO2 + 3.4H2 Pentose conversion to butyrate (Reaction 2) C5H10O5 → 0.8CH3CH2CH2COOH + 1.7CO2 + 1.8H2 Hexose conversion to acetate (Reaction 3) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2CH3COOH + 4H2 + 2CO2 Hexose conversion to butyrate (Reaction 4) C6H12O6 → CH3CH2CH2COOH + 2H2 + 2CO2 The main metabolites observed were butyrate (114−132 mM), lactate (109−140 mM) followed by acetate (16−109 mM) and ethanol (8−74 mM) (Fig. 3 A). As widely known, acetate-type fermentation from glucose results in 4 molH2. mol−1 glucose (Reaction 5). Similarly, butyrate- and ethanol-type fermentations lead to a yield of only 2 molH2. mol−1 glucose (Reaction 6–7) (Toledo-Alarcón et al., 2018). Acetate-type fermentation (Reaction 5) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2CH3COOH + 4H2 + 2CO2 ΔGº’ − 206.0 kJ mol−1 Butyrate-type fermentation (Reaction 6) C6H12O6 → CH3CH2CH2COOH + 2H2 + 2CO2 ΔGº’ − 255.0 kJ mol−1 Ethanol-type fermentation (glucose into ethanol and acetate) (Reaction 7) C6H12O6 + H2O → CH3CH2OH + CH3COOH + 2H2 + 2CO2ΔGº’ − 205.2 kJ mol−1 The above reactions give the impression that higher values for acetate are directly related to higher hydrogen production. However, acetate is also a product of hydrogen consumers (homoacetogens) whereas butyrate is inexorably linked to hydrogen-producing in mixed culture, and no direct hydrogen consumption pathway related to butyrate production has been reported so far (Guo et al., 2014). Furthermore, butyrate formation reaction is more energetically favorable, considering the Gibb's free energy (Reaction 6). In turn, ethanol-type fermentation occurs in condition with high acetate concentration and low pH (lower than 4) (Mota et al., 2018). The theoretical hydrogen production was calculated for each batch reactor. The measured hydrogen ranged between 6.3 % and 41.6 % of the theoretical hydrogen computed, suggesting homoacetogenesis play a key role in all batch reactors (Reaction 8). This finding is corroborated by the estimation of the measured acetate from homoacetogenesis (Eq. 8). Acetate issued by such a pathway reached values up to 94.6 % which explains the “low values” of hydrogen production and supports the butyrate-type fermentation as the main hydrogen-producing pathway in this study. The increment of agitation speed might be a strategy to avoid hydrogen consumption by homoacetogens (Corona and Razo-Flores, 2018). These authors observed a depletion of 9% in homoacetogenesis after increasing the agitation speed. Alternatively, biogas sequestration from the headspace of a fermentative system was able to lower the availability of hydrogen in the liquid medium and, thus, minimizing homoacetogens (Ferraz et al., 2020a,b). Homoacetogenesis (the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway) (Reaction 8) 4H2 + 2HCO3 − + H+ → CH3COO− + 4H2O ΔGº’ -104.5 kJ mol−1 Residual sugars, hydrogen production and metabolites represented between and 70.2 % and 83.8 % of the COD fed to batch reactors. The organic matter conversion into biomass was not computed (Supplementary Table 1). The experiments performed give also suitable information about the production of lactate, an added-value compound used to produce poly-lactic acid, a biodegradable plastic (Parra-Ramírez et al., 2019) and, interestingly, caproate, a medium-chain organic acid used as feed additive, plant growth promoter, etc. (Pan et al., 2020). Lactate is often reported in mesophilic hydrogen producing systems as an inhibitor of biohydrogen production process and rarely discussed as a commercial product (Reaction 9). In this study, high values of lactate (∼ 140 mM) were obtained at different values of pH (5.9, 8.5 and 11.0) of co-fermentation process (Table 3A). Lactate production, separation and purification was economically viable for some of the scales evaluated at a value of 1.89 USD.kg−1 (Parra-Ramírez et al., 2019). Yet, lactate jointly with ethanol are reported as ideal substrates for supplying electrons during carboxylic acid chain elongation through the reverse β-oxidation (RBO) reaction (Barker and Taha, 1942) (Reactions 10–11). In this process, the sequential formation of butyrate and, then, caproate from acetate is possible (de A.Cavalcante et al., 2017). The maximum caproate production observed was ∼ 45 mM at pH 8.5 of the CW and YMW dark fermentation (Table 3A). Its production probably occurred in two steps: (i) fermentation of organic matter and hydrogen consumption to acetate production via the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway followed by (ii) the RBO pathway. Furthermore, the market price of caproate is more than 10 times higher than that of ethanol (de A.Cavalcante et al., 2017). Despite these high values of short- and medium-chain organic acids production here observed, more detailed research on this topic must be performed in order to optimize the process, considering their productivity and yield.

15,Taxonomic proﬁle of the microbial community in the co-fermentation batch reactors,"3.6 Taxonomic proﬁle of the microbial community in the co-fermentation batch reactors 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences were analyzed to characterize the microbial community structure and reveal the CW and YMW co-fermentation conditions-associated changes (Fig. 3B). According to the results, the most abundant microorganisms detected in the co-fermentation process were related to the following roles: (i) hydrogen production (Alkaliphilus, Bacillus, Clostridium, Romboutsia, Ruminiclostridium and Sporacetigenium) (Ferraz, 2013, 2014a,b, 2015a, 2015b, An et al., 2018, 2020; Bu et al., 2021) (ii) ethanol-hydrogen co-production (Hydrogenispora) (Liu et al., 2014); (iii) hydrogen consumption (Oxobacter) (Greening et al., 2019); (iv) lactate production (Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Romboutsia, Sporolactobacillus and Streptococcus) (Castelló et al., 2020; Ferraz et al., 2017; Fuess et al., 2018) and (v) caproate production (Caproiciproducens) (Kim et al., 2015). These microorganisms are consistent with fermentative systems studies and coherently related to the metabolites presented in Fig. 3A and discussed in subhead 3.6. To further understand the interaction among the indicators of batch-reactor performances, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed (Fig. 4 ). Two principal components accounted for nearly 45 % of the dataset variance. The results showed two well-defined axes or principal components (PC): PC 1 which represents the main effect of lactate and its producers’ microorganisms opposing to H2Y, acetate and butyrate as well as caproate and Caproiciproducens (PC 2). These findings reinforcing that acetate-, butyrate-, caproate- and lactate-type fermentation were the main metabolic pathways (subhead 3.6) observed from the CCD experiments. The results also showed a low variation of ethanol and propionate, considering the variables and their levels studied. Finally, it should be noticed that the variables YMW, pH and inoculum were computed in the PCA as supplementary elements. It means that such coordinates are predicted using only the information provided by the performed PCA on active variables/individuals. Linked to Ferraz et al. (2014b), b and Luo et al. (Luo et al., 2011)."
16,Conclusions,"Co-fermentation of cheese whey and alkaline-pretreated Yerba Mate waste can be potentially used to produce hydrogen and short- and medium-chain organic acids. In terms of hydrogen production, the increase of inoculum and YMW concentrations had positive effects in the process while the initial pH had no significant effect on it, considering the conditions evaluated. Butyrate-type fermentation was the main hydrogen-producing pathway. Acetate from homoacetogenesis was accounted for all conditions evaluated. The Central Composite Design also indicated operating conditions to produce moderate-to-high concentrations of added value compounds, for instance, butyrate, lactate and caproate. 16S ribosomal DNA gene sequences analysis revealed five groups of microorganisms related to hydrogen, lactate and caproate production, ethanol-hydrogen co-production and hydrogen consumption. Principal Component Analysis computed three well-defined groups related to the hydrogen, lactate and caproate production."
