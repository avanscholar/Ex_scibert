0,Introduction,"The rapid progress of economic globalisation, population growth and industrialisation have led to a spike in fossil fuel consumption, resulting in greenhouse gas emissions and massive carbon accumulation in the atmosphere that inadvertently increases the global temperature, leading to global climate change. The rise in demand for energy has prompted nations to diversify their energy portfolio to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and enhance energy security. Biofuels produced from sustainable sources with suitable chemical properties have become one of the widely used alternatives [1,2]. First generation biofuels made from edible oils could have a direct impact on food security, depending on the types of crop used and the sufficiency of supply to the population [3]. Consequently, the energy industry focuses on alternative fuel sources. The second generation of biofuels is a concept focusing on organized and efficient residual biomass and waste utilization, including waste cooking oil (WCO). WCO is the oil residue obtained after cooking, which contains accumulated free fatty acids that makes it a technically viable feedstock for conversion to biofuel [4]. It is also widely available and inexpensive due to its numerous sources from restaurants, food processing industries, fast food outlets and households. Furthermore, the use of WCO reduces inter-competition between the oil resources and edible oil-based food crops and could provide a sustainable alternative for biofuel conversion since it is generated worldwide [5]. Cooking oil is mainly produced from edible oil plants. Multiple use of the same oil during continuous frying is also common due to economic reasons. Repetitive frying causes oxygen to dissolve in the oil to react with unsaturated acylglycerols, resulting in the development of various products such as dimeric and polymeric acids, dimeric acylglycerols and polyglycerols which increase the viscosity of the frying fat [6]. Reuse of WCO is also harmful for human consumption as lipid browning causes the oil to be more acidic and emits unpleasant odour. Further, the degraded used cooking oil contains high level of free fatty acid and water content for efficient biofuel conversion and hence the economic value is low [7]. The WCO disposal problem is an increasing global issue given the rise in human population and food consumption. There have been reports about illicit traders involved in reselling WCO and gutter oil in the market as normal cooking oil, raising the alarms on food safety and posing health risks [8]. Such issues have prompted policy makers to regulate the disposal and recycling methods of WCO, while providing the impetus for innovative approach to produce value-added products. In recent years, the concept of the circular economy has emphasised the reuse of waste materials, closing the cycle of the raw materials to preserve the values by maximizing the usage. WCO has emerged as one of the forerunning candidates, with much interests have been geared towards recycling and reutilising the WCO for the production of biofuels [9,10]. At present, WCO utilisation is mainly focused on certain well-established conversion methods for biodiesel production, while some interests have been shown in producing biojet fuel. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to review the different regulatory frameworks imposed by different countries for WCO recycling. Then, various established production methods of WCO biodiesel are reviewed, while several emerging production techniques with high reaction efficiency are introduced. Next, the conversion of WCO into biojet fuel is reviewed, with emphasis on the factors that govern the production efficiency. The reaction pathways and catalysts that have been investigated for WCO biojet fuel conversion are also analysed. Finally, the challenges faced in WCO biofuel commercialisation and its prospects are discussed by taking into considerations the economics and sustainability aspects."
1,Overview of WCO recycling practices,"Recycling and collection models of WCO driven by different local policies have given the opportunities to utilise WCO as a fuel source. Not only does WCO bring economic benefits as a biofuel feedstock, environmental hazards and public health problems posed by WCO discharge are also reduced. Interestingly, the approach in handling and recycling the WCO varies by countries. The following section explores some of the models of WCO collection and recycling implemented in major WCO producing countries."
2,China,"2.1 China The United States of America (US), China, India and members of the European Union contribute to more than half of the global vegetable oil consumption [11]. In China, the yearly production of WCO is estimated to be 5 million tonnes [12]. The government has offered recyclers various subsidies to encourage the collection and management of waste oils and push back illegal WCO recycling [13]. By regulating and incentivising the use of WCO as a source of clean power production such as biodiesel, the disposal of WCO for restaurants becomes financially feasible [14]. Under the country’s 13th Five-year Economic and Social Development Plan (2016–2020) for biomass energy sector, it is targeted that biofuel investments would amount to 18 billion Chinese Yuan by 2020, with emphasis on biofuel projects utilising non-food related raw materials [15]. WCO recycling modes can generally be categorised as biodiesel enterprise takeback (BET) or third-party takeback (TPT). Chinese cities such as Suzhou and Ningbo adopt the BET model, albeit with some differences. Developed countries such as the US and Japan adopt the TPT model where the WCO recycling and biodiesel production are treated as two separate entities [16]. The Ningbo government provides guidance, legal management, centralized collection and transportation, professional disposal, public participation and a market-oriented operation collection system, whereas the Suzhou government integrates storage and transportation activities to ensure no independent recyclers. The recycling models in these Chinese cities is shown in Fig. 1 . The Chinese government encourages resource recovery and harmless disposal of WCO by establishing special funding schemes and running recovery trials in 33 cities. For example, the Suzhou district government provides subsidies to biodiesel enterprises at 16.77 USD/t of biodiesel produced. In Beijing, it was found that despite producing 90.14 thousand tonnes of WCO in 2016, only 76% was accounted for in legal collectors [14]. The Ningbo government introduced the Measures of Ningbo Municipality for Kitchen Waste Management to regulate kitchen waste processing and to keep track of the waste produced. With these measures, large restaurants and establishments can collect and transport their kitchen waste independently, while other smaller establishments can pass their waste to the “urban environment and sanitation management” organization and pay fees in accordance with the provisions [5]."
3,Japan,"2.2 Japan In Japan, WCO production ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 million tonnes/year [11]. Before 1997, WCO was just disposed down the sewer. The increase in environmental awareness led to a cooperation between the communities and the government, thus WCO collection recovery has begun nationwide. Several towns such as Aito, Yokaichi, Imazu, Shin-asahi and local municipalities within the Shiga and Kagawa prefecture have started utilising WCO biodiesel in garbage collection vehicles [17]. The WCO waste can only be handed to licensed transportation enterprises or biofuel enterprises [18]. In the Japanese WCO recycling model, subsidies provided to biofuel enterprises help in reduce the production costs for the biofuel enterprises, strengthen its price competitiveness as compared to illegal manufacturers and further increase the recovery rate of WCO. Transaction taxes are waived for consumers who opt to fill their vehicle with 100% biofuel instead of fossil-based fuels [13]. Although TPT model is seen to be more commercially feasible as it brings in a third-party recycler and advanced recycling technologies into the supply chain, challenges with the reported cost difference between the two parties are often present. In a bid to further increase the recycling rate of WCO, the Japanese government has introduced and amended the Promotion Law on Effective Utilization of Resources in 2000 and the Act of Food Waste Recycling in 2001 successively to provide financial support via subsidies to raw material and tax incentives for sales [5]. In the Japanese WCO recycling model, the stakeholders include the biodiesel enterprises, restaurants, government and transportation enterprises. The Japanese collection system utilises an oil–water separation device system to ensure purity of WCO during the recycling process. Japanese restaurants need to install filters or separation devices to separate food wastes and WCO from water, while preventing the waste from flowing into the sewer. Besides, the Japanese government implements strict technical regulation measures and grants subsidies to the biodiesel enterprises. Fig. 2 shows the WCO recycling business model in Japan."
4,United States of America,"2.3 United States of America The acts that have been implemented to provide stricter controls on waste recovery in the United States of America (US) include the Solid Waste Disposal Act (1960), Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 and Energy Policy Act (2005). It was reported that biodiesels produced from recycled oil can receive a subsidy of 0.50 USD/gallon in the US, which has resulted in a near 100% WCO recycling rate [5]. The US WCO recycling mode is similar to that of Japan, where the stakeholders include biodiesel companies, restaurants and eateries, government and third-party waste oil collection companies. Restaurants and eateries responsible for processing kitchen waste are required to pay the waste recycling companies for processing the wastes. In order to obtain the necessary permit for proper waste dumping, the waste oil recycling companies are required to pay the business fees set by the US government. The biodiesel enterprises can receive moderate price subsidies and enjoy tax benefits [5]. In terms of the recycling rates and profits generated by the biodiesel enterprises, the US and Japanese models have seen high recycling rates due to strict control and reward mechanism. The WCO recycling business model in the US is shown in Fig. 3 ."
5,European Union,"2.4 European Union The European biodiesel market is known as the largest biodiesel market globally and also represents the third largest biofuel market in the world. The industry flourishes by providing income taxes for the state and reducing the country’s dependency on crude oil imports [19]. As of 2016, in all the EU countries combined, the total generated WCO is approximately 1,660,000 tones/yr, with 854,00 tones/year in households and 806,00 tones/yr in professional sector. The recovery rate is 5.6% and 86% for households and professional sector respectively [20]. Some countries such as Belgium, Sweden, Austria and Netherlands have proven that household collection can be highly efficient. The European Union Renewable Energy Directive (RED) has set up the objective of 10% of renewable energy consumption in transport (RES-T) in 2020. Relying on commercialized technologies at that time, most of the RES-T goals were obtained through blending of 1st generation biodiesel and 1st generation ethanol in conventional diesel and gasoline, respectively. In 2015 the RED was amended by introducing a set of sustainability criteria for biofuels to minimize the risk for indirect land use change (ILUC) related to biofuel production. This introduced the option that biofuels produced from waste-based feedstock can count twice their energy content towards RES-T share (double counting rules), hence heavily promoting the use of WCO and residual fats for biodiesel production. This led to the current state, where approximately 25% of the biodiesel in EU is obtained from WCO and residual fats, amounting to 1.4% of all energy used in transport. As fuel suppliers are obliged to meet the minimum blending content in their end-sales (enforced by fines that vary across the EU member states), the demand for WCO is exceeding its collected availability, leading to imports with China being a leading supplier. Due to massive demand, price that exceeds that of edible oils, lead to unofficial reports that a large portion of WCO used as a biodiesel feedstock in Europe is fraudulent and has no traceable origin. To counterfeit this, the Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Promotion of the Use of Energy from Renewable Sources was introduced as a requirement on traceability of WCO as well as a cap on WCO based biofuels (set to 1.7% of energy consumed in transport, without double counting rules) in order to regulate the uptake according to realistic availability of WCO within EU and to promote a shift towards advanced biofuels [21]. Following these directives, a lot of initiatives and implementation plans at various nations have been developed. For example, in an effort to minimize the total cost of transportation during waste collection and increase the number of customers within the collection network, the Portuguese government outsourced non-specialized vehicles to collect used tires and WCO from domestic sources (62% of total WCO produced nationwide) and implied a fixed cost per vehicle route and variable cost per kilometre travelled [22]. The “dedicated small producers” of WCO biodiesel in Portugal has a production limit of 3000 tonnes per year. They can either produce the WCO biodiesel or sell off the treated WCO to other biodiesel companies such as Spanish companies which have the benefits of tax exemptions [23]. In Spain, they have established WCO collection programs in Barcelona and Valladolid where collection bins are installed in neighbourhoods for biodiesel production [24]. In Hungary, primarily petrol companies collect WCO at selected petrol stations without any subsides. Then it is converted into biodiesel, which accounts for about 40% of the mandatory renewable content while the remaining portion originates from edible oils. Austria and Belgium are primarily seen as the successful examples for country-wide WCO collection in the region, with collections of up to 1 and 0.73 kg per capita respectively [25]. In Graz, Austria, an awareness campaign was conducted to improve WCO recycling rates by distributing information leaflets in restaurants and residential areas. Moreover, WCO collection containers were provided in taxis and buses, which saved about 33,766 USD for the maintenance of sewage and wastewater treatment [26]. As of now, around 20% of the 1200food businesses in Graz are actively collecting WCO with an estimated annual capacity of 200,000 L [27]. Belgium relies on Valorfrit, which is an umbrella association that coordinates WCO collection in Belgium [20]. It is obligatory and regulated by the federal government for the oil sellers as well as distributors to adhere to the WCO recycling program, hence establishing an efficient traceability of oil on the market and traceability of WCO through centralized collection. Under such terms, Belgium collects 64% of household WCO and almost all from the professional sector, leading to over 80% collection efficiency [20]. About 98% of the collected WCO is converted to biodiesel. As a leading example of traceable oil supply chain, the supply pathway is presented in Fig. 4 ."
6,Conversion of WCO to biodiesel,"Biodiesel is a potential alternative for substituting commercial diesel as the properties are similar and do not require any additional modification to existing compression ignition engines if low-volume blends are used. Some major fuel standards, like EN590 are limiting the biodiesel content in diesel fuel blends in order to preserve low-temperature performance of the fuel and reduce the impact on sealing materials which are well-known challenges related to biodiesel utilization. Common advantages of biodiesel over commercial diesel are reflected in reduced emissions of CO, HCs and soot, although some studies have shown a minimal increase of NOx emissions and brake specific fuel consumption [28]. The fuel properties of biodiesel are found to correlate with the fatty acid content or degree of unsaturation of the feedstock [29]. The fuel properties of the biodiesel need to meet the specifications of ASTM D6751 or EN 14214 standards in order to be qualified as a substitute for diesel and used in ground transportation. Traditionally, transesterification is often catalysed by a base catalyst as it can improve the reaction efficiency and produce high purity biodiesel. However, the use of the base catalyst for the transesterification reaction can only be conducted with low free fatty acid (FFA) content feedstock, as high level of FFA will react with the base catalyst and result in saponification. This results in a low yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) due to catalyst deactivation and triacylglycerol hydrolysis caused by saponification [30]. For the case of WCO, it is essential to determine the oil properties prior to biofuel production. This is due to the variation of WCO properties caused by utilisation mode and factors, such as continuous or discontinuous frying mode, frying time, oil re-use and type of fried foods in regards to sugar and protein content, which would cause the formation of polymers, dimers, oxidised triglycerides and free fatty acids [31]. Hence, to improve the yield and efficiency of biodiesel production, it is imperative to determine if the WCO contains a high acid value. A two-step biodiesel production method is often conducted to reduce the acid value of high FFA content oils. The first step is the esterification process commonly catalysed by acid catalyst such as H2SO4 or HCl as a pre-treatment, in which the FFA is converted into biodiesel. This is followed by the traditional transesterification process commonly catalysed by a base catalyst such as KOH or NaOH to convert triglyceride, along with alcohol into FAME and glycerol [4,32]. The two-step esterification-transesterification process is shown in Fig. 5 . Besides traditional acid or base catalyst, the reaction can also be catalysed with non-conventional catalysts such as enzymes, industrial waste and biological sourced catalysts. The use of these catalysts as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly technique have been reviewed [33–35]. Catalyst aside, the reaction can also be varied by using different production methods. Although the methods vary in terms of reaction mechanism and conditions, the emphasis is to improve the mixability of the solvents to enhance the rate of reaction to produce higher yield of biodiesel. Fig. 6 shows the advanced methods commonly used by researchers for the transesterification of WCO."
7,Microwave assistance,"3.1 Microwave assistance A recent advancement in biodiesel conversion technologies is the use of microwave irradiation to improve the production yield. Microwave irradiation generates a magnetic field within the sample volume to force random thermal motions of the reactants to orientate based on an electric field and provide heat, where the heat transfer efficiency depends on the dielectric properties of the sample [40]. Microwaves, which are electromagnetic waves within the 300 MHz to 300 GHz frequencies and wavelengths between 1 mm and 1 m, accelerate the molecular movement with ionic migration or dipole rotation but do not change the molecular structure [41]. Microwave assistance is also known to use 23 times less energy than conventional heating methods [42]. In addition to the thermal advantages of microwave assistance during transesterification of WCO, it is also capable of breaking down heavy hydrocarbons (C51-C57) into lighter hydrocarbons (C4-C18) through the chain-end scission mechanism [43]. Previous work on the microwave-assisted transesterification of WCO and their related optimum conditions are shown in Table 1 . It can be seen that the quality of the WCO varies, with different acid values shown depending on the source. Microwave-assisted biodiesel production from WCO with conventional KOH catalyst was able to achieve a 95% yield within 5 min [44]. However, given the various production methods of WCO, the optimised conditions for biodiesel production from the feedstock is inconsistent. The acid value of WCO constantly varies due to the preservation and heat of oil, and thus should be measured to assess the quality of the oil. Higher acid value oils would require more catalysts and alcohol, greater microwave power and longer reaction time for optimum biodiesel production [41]. It should be noted that excessive microwave power leads to accelerated saponification of triglycerides and damages the organic molecules [42]."
8,Pyrolysis,"3.2 Pyrolysis The pyrolysis of biomass is a thermochemical conversion technique which results in the production of char, oil and gas [49]. The technique decomposes waste products under oxygen-deficient conditions to produce valuable products for energy and chemical applications [31]. In the case of producing higher volumes of liquid products, fast pyrolysis is often applied, as the product yield is highly dependent on temperature while the lignin-cellulose content affects the product composition and properties [50]. Fast pyrolysis conducted on biomass maximises the oil production from dry feedstock (>80%), but the process is rather energy intensive [51]. Although the technique is often conducted on solid feedstocks, the petrochemical industry utilises the technique to break down liquid oil components of high molecular weight to smaller molecular compounds which can be used as fuel or fuel blend [52]. One major advantage of the pyrolysis technique over other transesterification processes is that relatively low amount of acidic or alkaline effluents are produced and the end products contain high oxidation stability due to the absence of oxygen during the reaction [53]. Table 2 shows the main variables associated with biodiesel produced via pyrolysis. However, one drawback for fast pyrolysis is the inferior quality of the liquid product obtained, which often requires further effort to upgrade the product [57]. Direct pyrolysis products tend to have a relatively high oxygen content, acid value and condensation and cold filter point, which are not desirable for combustion within a diesel engine [53]. It has been reported that pyrolysis-derived biodiesels require hydrogenation to reduce the organic carbon atom loss and allow the double bonds to hydrogenate to form single bonds [58]. This can be seen for the case of Ben Hassen Trabelsi et al. [31], where they found that direct pyrolysis of WCO was capable of producing fuel with high higher heating value but has a poor acidity index with high viscosity. Hence, for the case of WCO, it is suggested that pyrolysis is conducted with a catalyst to improve the fuel properties. The catalytic process of oils is able to produce a mixture of coke, diesel, gasoline and liquid petroleum gas [52]. Therefore, the catalyst used during catalytic pyrolysis of WCO should be determined by the product required. Wang et al. [52] compared fluid catalytic cracking on WCO with several commercial catalysts and found that high amount of Lewis and Brönsted acid sites in the catalyst would result in higher biodiesel yields. Besides catalytic pyrolysis of WCO, there were several reports on the co-pyrolysis of WCO with other solid biomass. Co-pyrolysis has been reported as a more cost efficient alternative to improve the quality and quantity of oil obtained from solid biomass while achieving an upgraded bio-oil suitable for biofuel production [57]. A co-pyrolysis study using WCO and tea residual shows that 600 °C was the optimum temperature for maximum aromatic and olefins yields, but no fuel property testing was conducted [59]. Microwave co-pyrolysis of WCO and polyolefins under vacuum conditions also improved the heating rate (+2 °C/min) and oil yields (+12 wt%) when compared to conventional pyrolysis with inert conditions [55]. Although there have been several reports on the catalytic pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of WCO, there has been a lack of compositional analysis on the pyrolysis products, with a majority of the studies focusing on improving the liquid product yields and fuel properties instead. Chen et al. [50] reported that the oil product of WCO-corn cob co-pyrolysis has a high acid value (25 mgKOH/g), which is not suitable for direct application in engine. On the other hand, microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and WCO produced liquid oil of sulphur-free with low oxygen and nitrogen content, and has higher heating value (49 MJ/kg) than commercial diesel and gasoline [43], indicating the potential for practical application."
9,Ultrasound assistance,"3.3 Ultrasound assistance The use of ultrasonic waves to enhance the biodiesel conversion process from WCO is also a commonly utilised technique. Ultrasound applies a cavitation condition consisting of formation, growth and violent implosions of microbubbles which generate heat [60]. The oscillation of cavitation bubbles and shock waves created by the collapse of those bubbles generate high localised pressure and temperature points, which in turn increase the rate of transesterification [59]. Additionally, when a sample is irradiated with ultrasonic waves, an extra acoustic pressure adds up to the already present hydrostatic pressure, creating high pressures in the cavitation bubbles which enhances the formation of radicals and chemical reaction, leading to stronger shockwaves as a result of the collapse of those bubbles [60]. The effect of this pressure is more prominent at high frequencies as the attenuation of the sound waves is higher in this region, hence releasing more energy [61]. The process can also be conducted with lower temperatures, which minimises the risk of thermal damage to the extracted components [62]. Besides, ultrasonic waves can also significantly reduce the alcohol concentration and the time required for a complete transesterification reaction [63]. Besides the mechanical effects, there are also chemical effects which affect the reaction mechanism for ultrasonic-assisted reaction. Ultrasound is known to induce radicals such as H, OH, HO2 in aqueous solutions which promotes chemical conversion [64]. One consideration for ultrasonic treatment is that it provokes oxidative degradation in edible oils, since temperature rise occurs in a short time period [65]. The frequency of ultrasonic cavitation is found to be the influencing factor which affects the quality of oils, especially the oxidation stability [59]. Current biodiesel production with ultrasound assistance is often sonicated with an ultrasonic probe/horn or ultrasonic bath. Although both provide similar ultrasound waves within the range of 18 kHz to 100 MHz, the biodiesel yield and properties may differ [60]. Table 3 shows the notable differences between both ultrasonication techniques. The use of ultrasonic assistance as a method for improving biodiesel conversion yields and reducing the required catalyst, alcohol and reaction time has been reported. Recent studies show the utilisation of sustainable heterogeneous catalysts to reduce the drawbacks commonly associated with conventional homogenous catalysts. Pukale et al. [71] compared the effectiveness of sodium and potassium phosphate as a heterogenous catalyst via the ultrasonic-assisted WCO transesterification technique. Result shows that a conversion of 92% of FAME was achieved with the latter. The use of modified coal fly ash, a residue from coal power plants, was also reported to be a capable catalyst for ultrasonic-assisted WCO transesterification, producing 95.57% of biodiesel in 1.41 mins, but requiring high amount of methanol and catalyst (10.71:1 methanol to WCO molar ratio and 4.97 wt% catalyst) [72]. Another common sustainable catalyst used for biodiesel transesterification is calcium oxide, which can be obtained by heating calcium carbonate derived from egg shells [73]. Gupta [74] found that calcium diglyceroxide, a by-product of calcium oxide after glycerol formation during transesterification, was capable of producing high yield of biodiesel (93.5%), but showed a significant drop in yield beyond the first cycle due to the solubility of calcium diglyceroxide in the glycerol-methanol mixture. Besides, the ultrasonic-assisted transesterification of WCO with dimethyl carbonate and immobilized enzyme (Novozym 435) in a solvent-free system resulted in 57.68% biodiesel yield after 4 h, which could increase to 86.61% when ultrasonic is paired with stirring [75]. This shows that ultrasonic-assisted transesterification process can still be further improved by using novel, economic and environmental-friendly catalysts. However, the scaling-up process for this method may be relatively difficult as the volume of fuel produced will be affected by probe or bath size, which are directly related to total power input and production cost."
10,Supercritical transesterification,"3.4 Supercritical transesterification Another advanced method in recent WCO biodiesel studies is the use of supercritical conditions for transesterification. Supercritical alcohols that have been used for non-catalytic production of biodiesel include methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, dimethyl carbonate, methyl acetate and methyl tert-butyl ether [76]. Supercritical transesterification reaction not only decreases the capital cost by leaving out soap separation and production of waste water, but is also able to produce high purity biodiesel from feedstocks with high FFA content [77]. The separation of biodiesel is also easier since no catalyst is used and the reaction can be completed in a shorter time compared to the two-step process [78]. However, it should be noted that the process requires the elevation of pressure to a supercritical stage. The selected pressure should also be high enough to ensure solubility between the oil and methanol to enable high conversion efficiency in a short time frame [78]. Fig. 7 shows the schematic diagram of a typical setup for supercritical transesterification of WCO. The supercritical methanol reaction was shown to be more economical than the homogeneous basic transesterification reaction in the long term due to its higher net present value (NPV), discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFRR) and lower construction costs [77]. In the scenario of producing 40,000 tonne/yr of biodiesel (revenue of 39.6 million USD/yr), it was reported that the supercritical methanol reaction would have a NPV of 21.1 million USD, 49.6% DCFRR and capital investment of 14.8 million USD [79]. However, supercritical methanol technology also has several disadvantages, such as the large excess of methanol is required for supercritical reaction and high operating cost induced by extreme temperature and pressure. Table 4 shows the various studies of supercritical transesterification of WCO. One major parameter that affects the supercritical transesterification of WCO is the reaction time. Studies with high conversion yields indicate that a sufficient reaction time of 15 to 30 min is required to obtain maximum conversion, followed by a drop in yield due to loss of unsaturated FAME under high temperature [77]. It is also important to note that contrary to catalysed transesterification processes, the presence of water promotes the formation of methyl esters under supercritical state [10]. This makes the use of WCO, a feedstock commonly associated with high water content and FFA content, suitable for supercritical transesterification [80]."
11,Novel methods for biodiesel conversion,"3.5 Novel methods for biodiesel conversion 3.5.1 Catalytic membrane Catalytic membranes have the simultaneous function of separation and catalytic reaction. They have similar effects as heterogeneous catalysts, which are developed to overcome the difficulty of separating liquid acid catalysts. Other advantages of catalytic membranes are lower cost, reusability, mild reaction conditions, no pollution to the environment and non-corrosivity [83]. Catalytic membranes are also known to effectively remove or add reactants, breaking and shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium, which could improve net reaction rate, percentage of conversion, selectivity and thereby the yield [84]. The chosen type of catalytic membrane depends on the following parameters such as production capacity, separation selectivity, lifetime of the membrane, mechanical and chemical properties under operating conditions and cost. Catalytic membranes can be classified as organic and inorganic membranes according to the requirements of the chemical process. Polymeric membranes usually operate at temperatures not exceeding 300 °C. Inorganic membranes can function at relatively high temperatures due to strong resistance to chemical degradation [85]. Table 5 summarises the advantages and disadvantages of the organic and inorganic catalytic membranes. It is clear that much research is needed to advance the technology by resolving the issues of cost and improving the properties of the membranes for scaled-up deployment. Fig. 8 shows the schematic of a catalytic membrane reactor used to produce FAME. The catalytic membrane reactor consists of a membrane unit and a catalytic reactor, in which the catalytic reaction and separation occur simultaneously. FAME penetrates through the membrane, while unreacted triglycerides and FFA remain in the reactor and are eventually discharged as retentate [86]. The limitations of the catalytic membrane are mainly related to the high capital cost of fabrication [85]. Although transesterification with the catalytic membrane is considered as a novel method, studies on the conversion of WCO to biodiesel remain scarce. In a tubular reactor, WCO is transesterified with the heterogeneous catalysts of WOx/Al2O3, where inorganic membranes are driven by pressure, and the separation process is related to the difference in molar mass of the components. It was found that 85% of WCO was successfully converted into biodiesel [87]. Another study reported that WCO-derived biodiesel with a purity of 97.4% can be achieved with the reaction temperature of 60 °C, reaction time of 90 min, mass ratio of methanol / acidified oil of 2: 1 while fixing the microwave power at 360 W with 3 g of catalytic membrane loading [83]. 3.5.2 Magnetic fluidisation Magnetic fluidised transesterification of WCO is another method currently being studied. The advantage of a magnetic fluidised system is that the catalyst can be easily recovered by magnetic decantation, which reduces the production time cycle and avoids conventional filtration issues [88]. Inorganic catalyst or catalyst supports can also be fabricated to be porous and have high specific surface area, which can increase the active site of catalysts, thereby improving catalyst activity [89]. Besides, magnetic fluidised bed reactors have the advantages of lower pressure drop, high mass transfer efficiency, counter-current contact, superior mass transfer and high contact efficiency between particles and fluid without solid mixing [12]. However, it has been reported that for acidic magnetic catalyst, the particles can easily aggregate into large clusters owing to the anisotropic dipolar interactions which reduce the catalytic activity [90]. A recent trend in catalyst studies is the use of organic catalysts to improve recyclability. Organic catalysts often face the problems of low mass transport, complicated reaction and long reaction time [12]. In order to improve the poor performance of certain biological catalysts, some researchers have used the support of a magnetic material, which not only improve the conversion efficiency but also eases the separation process. For example, a Km12 lipase was coupled with amino coatedmagnetitenanoparticles and achieved 71% of WCO biodiesel conversion, which is 20% more than those uncoupled enzyme [91]. Table 6 shows the organic and inorganic magnetic catalysts commonly used for biodiesel conversion. Although certain organic catalysts coupled with magnetic support have shown excellent catalytic performance for biodiesel conversion yield, it is noted that the reaction time is still relatively long and the amount of methanol used is high, which may impact the feasibility of the process. Fig. 9 shows the mechanism of a magnetic fluidised system. 3.5.3 Electrolysis Although electrolysis is a common process used to produce hydrogen from water [102], the method found an alternative use in biodiesel production. This method involves an electrolytic cell consisting of two electrodes immersed in the reaction mixture of alcohol, oil and a supporting electrolyte. The setup requires a constant voltage running through the mixture and monitoring of the electrical conductivity and pH with electrolysis time. Methoxide ions are formed when methanol reacts with a hydroxyl ion (OH−) and attack the carbonyl group in the glyceride molecules to form FAME [103]. The electrolysis method has several advantages, including low energy consumption due to the room temperature reaction, shorter reaction time, lesser production of waste water from the washing process and removal of the purification stage [104]. Another major advantage of using electrolysis for biodiesel conversion process is the ability to utilise high water content feedstock (>2%) to form H+ and OH− ions, which can then act as the acid or base catalysts for the transesterification reaction [105]. Of late, there have been several studies investigating the use of electrolysis for biodiesel production from WCO. Biodiesel production via electrolysis with common base catalysts such as KOH and NaOH have achieved high yields of FAME (>95%) despite the WCO containing high amount of water [103,104]. A recent electrolysis study on using heterogeneous zeolite catalyst for biodiesel production from WCO indicated that the addition of acetone could improve the homogeneity of the solution and achieved 93% yield of FAME [106]. Fig. 10 shows the setup of an electrolysis-assisted transesterification. 3.5.4 Hydrodynamic cavitation Hydrodynamic cavitation is the process occurring in a moving liquid where vaporisation, bubble formation and implosion occur due to a decrease and subsequent rise in local pressure [107]. Cavitation occurs only when the local pressure drops below the liquid saturation vapor pressure and then subsequently returns to the level above it. However, if the subsequent pressure is unable to increase beyond this point, it is called flashing. Hydrodynamic cavitation hence occurs, e.g., when liquid passing through a narrow channel at specific conditions or when there are rotating solid objects in the liquid. Bubbles are generated, grown and ruptured, on the surface of the liquid which leads to high energy density and local temperature along with pressure rise in a very short time. Maddikeri et al. [108] found that using slit venturi, instead of the orifice plate and circular venturi, 90% conversion yield of FAME can be achieved. Due to the cavitation effect, a mini-emulsion is generated and a large interfacial area is provided for the reaction, and the recirculation reaction through the cavitation chamber is intensified. Chuah et al. [109] found that the hydraulic cavitation using an orifice plate with 21 holes of 1 mm diameter shape at 2 bar resulted in 98% conversion efficiency. The process took 15 min, which is only 1/8 of the time needed for mechanical stirring. The efficiency of the transesterification also improved with increase in pressure, but there was no observable effect beyond 2 bar at downstream area of the orifice plate, as the local area was filled with a large number of cavities which coalesced and formed a larger cavity, causing cavitation choking. Other reasons for drop of transesterification rate with increase of inlet pressure include decomposition reaction (>3.8 bar) and degradation (>4 bar) [110,111]. Table 7 shows the various studies regarding WCO biodiesel production with hydrothermal cavitation. From the available studies, it can be seen that slit venturi gives better biodiesel yield as compared to orifice plate and circular venturi, since the number of cavitation event is more as compared to orifice plate and circular venturi due to the higher volumetric flow rate for a given pressure drop and lower cavitation number [108]. However, when utilising orifice plates, it is noticed that the higher number of holes with a smaller diameter will increase the velocity and decrease the cavitation number, resulting in plate geometry with lower values of β (the ratio of hole diameter to pipe diameter) and β0 (the ratio of the total flow area to the cross sectional area of the pipe). A higher value of the total hole perimeter will result in increased biodiesel conversion."
12,Energy balance of the transesterification process,"3.6 Energy balance of the transesterification process The competitiveness of WCO-derived biodiesel to petroleum diesel is largely influenced by the energy balance of its production. This subsection does not analyse the energy requirement of logistics, however, highly urbanized areas with optimally designed collection points evidently lead to favourable conditions. Also, the current trends in energy shifted towards electricity production over combined heat and power. Consequently, industrial waste heat can be efficiently utilised for this purpose. Transesterification of triglyceride to FAME is an endothermic process, requiring about 282 kJ/kmol of energy [113]. In turn, the chemical conversion consumes only about Econv = 100 J/kg. Compared to average lower heating value (LHV) of WCO biodiesel which is 37 MJ/kg, it can be concluded that the key reaction process bears low influence in the energy balance of biodiesel production. Consequently, the energy inlet has a high impact on providing the required conditions of the forward reaction with high yield, which is briefly analysed in the following. The results are summarized in Table 8 . The self-consumption, SC, is calculated by Eq. (1): (1) SC = [ E conv + c WCO ∙ T conv - T 0 ] / L H V where cWCO is the specific heat of the WCO, Tconv is the conversion temperature, and T 0 = 25 °C ambient temperature was assumed. Pyrolysis in the temperature range of 550–800 °C [31] requires significant heat inlet since such a temperature source as waste heat is usually not available. By considering specific heat of cWCO = 3 kJ/kgK [114] as a slight overestimation, the result is that getting WCO to such temperatures in an adiabatic tank consumes 1.65–2.4 MJ/kg alone. Compared to the LHV of WCO biodiesel (37 MJ/kg), it is about 4.3–6.3%, thus making this technology the least energy-efficient among the evaluated ones. Using biological catalysts enables yield above 90%, while the required temperature can be kept as low as 40 °C [35]. In this case, the energy requirement is <0.2% of the biodiesel LHV, hence, it can be considered as a highly efficient transesterification method. However, a drawback here is that the yield is a few percent lower than by using other, non-biological catalysts, and such reactors require notable residence time and more careful handling. Microwave-assisted transesterification is claimed to be about 20-fold more energy-efficient than conventional heating, while the exposure time is in the range of one minute [115]. For laboratory purposes, this method is impressive, however, the advantage significantly decreases with upscaling [116]. By comparing to the energy demand of conventional heating, which is about 110 kJ/kg, microwave-assisted heating decreased it to 30 kJ/kg in a continuous-flow reactor mode at 7.2 L/min flow rate [116]. This latter layout is equivalent to a small industrial capacity, nevertheless, there is no industrial plant using this technique, according to the present knowledge of the authors. Ultrasonic conversion is also a fast method, which is used in industrial scales as well. The upside of this technique is that the energy demand is only about threefold of that of the theoretical demand of transesterification [117]. Preheating is only required to 45–65 °C, while the yield is below 96% [72]. Overall, the energy requirement of this technique is <0.3% of the biodiesel LHV. Similar results can be obtained by using hydrodynamic cavitation due to the identical physical–chemical processes [109,112]. Supercritical transesterification, as its name suggests, requires high temperature and pressure. The catalyst-less mixture has to be heated up over 250 °C to get high yield [10,80], which is the equivalent energy consumption of 2% of the biodiesel LHV. Even though this process is more than twice efficient compared to pyrolysis, large-scale use is hindered by its excessive energy consumption compared to, e.g., ultrasonic conversion. Both catalytic membrane and magnetic fluidized transesterification processes are alternative technologies for handling the catalyst. Since the energy consumption of this step was omitted in the above examples, they are not evaluated at this time. Otherwise, these processes can be combined with the current technologies being assessed, which determine the energy balance of the transesterification process. The advantage of electrolysis is that the mixture to be processed does not require preheating, which enables efficient operation – from a thermal point of view. Assuming conversion conditions of 18.6 V and 0.05 A for 2 h on a 28 mL sample [88] the resulting SC is 0.8% [88]. Since the time required for the process is a few hours [103,104], this technology is considerably less attractive. Overall, it can be concluded that the transesterification process with high yield can be performed by using energy less than 1% of the LHV of biodiesel using various available technologies. High-temperature processes are hence less attractive, even though they offer notable simplifications like omitting the catalyst in supercritical transesterification. If industrial waste heat can be utilised, the required slight temperature increase, i.e., up to 45–65 °C, can be reasonably covered. The obvious winner in the energy balance is ultrasonic transesterification, which is characterized by low energy use yet fast production. Concluding from the favourable nature of this technology, the spreading of such facilities is expected in the future for WCO processing as an optimal solution."
13,Conversion of WCO to biojet fuel,"Besides the production of biodiesel, fuel research also focuses on the production of bio-jet from WCO. It is expected that air travel would increase by 5% annually until 2026, which would further grow the jet fuel demand by 3% [118]. Commercial jet fuel is a fossil fuel primarily consisting C8 to C16 hydrocarbons. As of 2012, the global consumption of commercial jet fuel is 13.16 EJ, covering 12% of the global transportation energy consumption, and is forecasted to increase by another 10.5 EJ by 2040 [119]. The detrimental effects of fossil fuel combustion are fluctuation of oil prices and emissions of greenhouse gases. The expected rise of air transportation passengers and the corresponding increase in fuel consumption indicates that clean alternative fuel is required in the industry. The production of an alternate source such as biojet fuel can be a viable sustainable option, but the stumbling block is the high price of biojet fuel, which is three to nine folds more expensive than conventional petroleum jet fuel [120]. The development of biojet fuel from renewable sources would not only reduce the reliance on fossil fuels, but also can potentially reduce CO2 emissions by up to 68.1% in 2050 [121]. The physiochemical properties of biojet fuel should be similar to that of commercial jet fuel, hence is considered as “drop-in” fuel as the former can be used interchangeably with the latter. The fuel specifications play an important role when determining the biojet fuel quality [122]. The research on combustion characteristics of biojet fuel is essential to estimate any potential operational issues prior to commercialisation. For example, bio-jet fuel blend is required to possess similar heating value as conventional jet A-1 fuel (min 42.8 MJ/kg) according to the ASTM D7566 standard, as the loss of power would put the flight operation at risk. When producing jet fuel, the emphasis is placed on a high hydrogen/carbon ratio for improved combustion properties and to avoid carbon deposition in the jet engine [123]. The alternative jet fuel produced from non-petroleum source needs to conform to the property specifications of ASTM D7566. The standard practices for evaluating the performance of biojet fuel are stated in the ASTM D4054, of which the test programs comprise of fuel specification properties, fit-for purpose (FFP) properties, component tests and engine tests. The type of feedstocks for biojet fuel production can broadly be categorised into three generations. The first generation feedstocks consists of edible vegetable oils, second generation feedstocks include non-edible oil crops and lignocellulosic biomass, while the third generation feedstock is based on microalgae biomass [119]. The selection of an appropriate feedstock for biojet fuel production is dependent on various factors such as the number of double bonds, fatty acid composition, cold flow properties, feedstock availability, transportation and economic feasibility [124]. The type of feedstock will also affect the production pathway choice for biojet fuel. Furthermore, the production of biojet fuel also requires the approval of stringent property specifications, which makes the development of this technology much more challenging than that of ground transportation biofuels [125]. The ASTM D7566 standard for aviation fuel containing synthesised hydrocarbons from esters and fatty acid esters was first published in July 2011. At the time of writing, the latest revision ASTM D7566-19b published in Dec 2019 was updated with 6 approved biojet fuels. Among them, conversion of fatty acid-based feedstock into biojet fuel can be performed via the hydrogenated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) and catalytic hydrothermal jet (CHJ) pathways [119]. The standard serves as a guideline for the growing commercial use of biojet fuel. The fuel specification allows the blending of up to 50% biojet fuel with conventional jet fuel and provides the framework for certifying other alternative jet fuels [126]. The quality of the biojet fuel is also dependent on the type of catalyst used and reaction parameters [127]. Hydrotreating is a well-known biojet fuel conversion technique but has been commercially restricted due to the limited availability of fatty/oil feedstocks [128]. There are several physicochemical properties which are essential when evaluating the quality of biojet fuel. Table 9 shows the various physiochemical properties specified in ASTM D7566 for biojet fuel produced from HEFA and CHJ in comparison with commercial grade jet fuel. There are several reaction pathways for biojet fuel production, which include catalytic hydrogenation, catalytic hydrothermolysis, decarboxylation or hydrotreating, isomerisation and cracking, hydrodeoxygenation, Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, acid condensation and alcohol dehydration (ethanol, isobutanol or butanol) [119]. Catalytic hydrogenation or HEFA is seen as the most promising method for biojet fuel conversion from WCO due to the composition of triglycerides and long-chain carbon fatty acids, while dehydration and decarboxylation can produce diesel range carbon chains [125]. The method has also been widely used for the conversion of vegetable oils to biojet fuel. However, there are several challenges such as the catalyst formulation, carbon forming mechanism, evaluation of high pressure and source for hydrogen that need to be considered prior to commercialisation [28]. On the other hand, the CHJ processing method is a conversion technique often conducted on algal or oil plants under mild conditions (250 to 380 °C, 5 to 30 MPa in the presence of water or methanol/ethanol solvents) [119], which could be another processing option for WCO. This section of the paper will describe the current production pathways used to convert WCO into biojet fuel as well as the commercial use of it as a blending component."
14,Hydrotreating esters and fatty acids,"4.1 Hydrotreating esters and fatty acids The hydrotreatment of esters and fatty acids is a process which converts triglycerides and unsaturated fatty acids into jet fuel range hydrocarbons. The triglycerides in vegetable oils and WCO often have long carbon chain length (C14-C22), which make them unsuitable for jet fuel application after hydrotreatment [131]. Therefore, the process is generally separated into two steps. Initially, the triglycerides are saturated with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst at high temperature and pressure, followed by isomerisation and cracking to reduce the carbon chain length and produce jet fuel range hydrocarbons [51]. Although non-catalytic hydrotreatment can also be performed on oils, the presence of a catalyst eases the selectivity of the reaction to obtain the expected products [132]. It is suggested that the catalyst used is heterogenous to the feedstock to ease the separation and allow the reuse or regeneration of catalysts. The chosen catalyst should also be more acidic as the selectivity of the hydrotreatment process is influenced by the acid strength [133]. The deoxygenation reaction yield will increase with acid catalyst concentration to a certain point, before excessive catalyst loading occurs and the catalyst active sites are reduced due to deposition of residual coke, which ultimately results in catalyst deactivation [134]. Basic catalysts have poor deoxygenation performance and often cause undesirable cracking which forms light hydrocarbon fractions, but some authors have suggested the conjugation of a base and acid catalyst for effective decarboxylation performance and reduced coke formation [135]. The main difference between jet fuel and diesel range hydrocarbons is the carbon chain length, as diesel has a longer carbon chain length which results in a higher freezing point [136]. The poor cold flow properties of FAME at high altitudes have led FAME to be considered as a contaminant in biojet fuel composition and should be limited to 5 mg/kg or 5 ppm according to ASTM D1655-19a standard [137]. On the other hand, the freezing points of jet fuels should be relatively low as it will be used at altitudes with low temperatures. Other products of this process include light gases and naphthas, which can be easily separated by distillation. When utilising WCO as the fuel feedstock, a filtration and cleaning process is conducted to remove any food sediments from the mixture followed by a heating process to remove water. After this pre-treatment, the deoxygenation process (decarboxylation, decarbonylation and hydrodeoxygenation) followed by the isomerisation and the cracking steps are conducted. In certain cases, the deoxygenation and cracking processes can also be combined into a single step [9]. An additional concern when utilising WCO for biojet fuel production is the varying quality and physicochemical properties due to different cooking conditions and the presence of salt and water content, which could complicate the production process [7]. The production pathway of WCO biojet fuel via the HEFA production pathway is illustrated in Fig. 11 . 4.1.1 Deoxygenation The deoxygenation process consists of three different reactions, namely decarboxylation, decarbonylation and hydrodeoxygenation that produce alkanes, also known as synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK), with significantly lower aromatic content. Initially, the deoxygenation process of vegetable oil was commercialised by a Finish company, Neste Oil, to produce long-chain hydrocarbons from triglyceride-based oils via oxygen removal [124]. The hydrodeoxygenation process involves the deoxygenation of oxygenated compounds by incorporating hydrogen assisted by an appropriate catalyst to produce an alkane of equal carbon chain length along with water [138]. On the other hand, decarboxylation deoxygenates through the C–C bond scission to form CO2 without H2, while decarbonylation generates CO and water by using H2 to remove oxygen through the C–O bond scission, with both reactions producing an alkane with one shorter carbon chain length [139]. When considering the carbon atom economy, hydrodeoxygenation is the most viable option as it does not lose any carbon atoms [140]. Although the hydrodeoxygenation process can significantly improve the fuel properties, the large consumption of H2 gases can impact the sustainability and economics of the process, since H2 is primarily produced from natural gases [141]. The efficiency of the deoxygenation process is often affected by several factors which include the selected catalyst, support for that catalyst and reaction conditions. There are various metal catalysts which can be used for the deoxygenation reaction, including pure metals, metallic mixtures (bimetallic, trimetallic and metallic admixture), metal oxides, metal phosphides, metal nitrides and metal carbides [142]. Platinum group metals such as Pd and Pt are known to be resistant against corrosion and oxidation under harsh conditions. These metals are usually supported with zeolites, activated carbons or oxides when used as catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation reaction [138]. Noble metals or transition metals often facilitate the decarbonylation or decarboxylation by weakening the carbonyl or carboxyl group, whereas transition metal oxides with moderate acidity encourage deoxygenation by activating the hydroxyl group [143]. Pd is known to be an excellent catalyst for the formation of straight chain paraffinic hydrocarbons but its high cost and vulnerability leads to deactivation due to active site poisoning by adsorbed reaction intermediates such as heavy organic substances, carbonaceous deposits and carbon monoxide (CO), thus making it impractical for commercial use [144]. The inefficiency of monometallic catalysts for biojet fuel production has led researchers to investigate the potential of combining noble metals with a cheaper metal to obtain a synergistic catalyst effect. This effect is also known as a bi-functional catalyst, as illustrated in Fig. 12 . Bimetallic catalysts such as PtRe have shown superior catalytic activity than monometallic Pt catalysts, owing to the high oxygen affinity of Re [141]. Besides, PtSnx/C catalysts, where x represents any value from 0 to 4, are said to provide 2 to 3 times more alkanes than monometallic Pt catalysts in decarboxylation batch reactions at 350 °C for 2 h [146]. Cheah et al. [144] compared PdNi and PdCu catalysts and found that the former performed better due to the presence of Ni that facilitates access to the hydrogen donor and the reaction of the hydrogen with the fatty acid. Given the high price of Pd and Pt catalysts, Ni-based catalysts have also gained attention due to their high cracking and methanation activity, but have severe risks of catalyst deactivation [147]. In certain cases, Ni2P, which has bifunctional active sites, are known to perform equally well as noble metals. The hydrodeoxygenation of WCO at atmospheric pressure and 320 °C achieved 89% oxygen removal when conducted with Ni2P catalyst supported by activated carbon [148]. On the other hand, the hydrodeoxygenation of WCO with NiMo/γ-Al2O3-β-zeolite at 350 °C at 5 MPa for 3 h yielded 98% of diesel range hydrocarbons, which may be due to the weaker acidity of the catalyst [149]. However, these hydrocarbons could still be further isomerized to obtain biojet fuel. Besides these catalysts, Abdulkareem-Alsultan et al. [150] studied the deoxygenation of WCO using highly stable Ag2O3(10%)–La2O3(20%)/ACnano catalyst and obtained 89% hydrocarbon yield with 93% biodiesel fraction. The catalyst was capable of maintaining high yield (>80%) for 6 consecutive runs under milder conditions (1 wt% of loading of catalyst, 350 °C of reaction temperature, and 120 min of reaction time). Other catalysts used for the deoxygenation of WCO include metal oxides such as CaO, TiO2, Mn(IV)O and ZnO. Yildiz et al. [130] compared the deoxygenation of WCO under hydrogen-free conditions with these catalysts and observed that TiO2 catalyst produced the highest yield of alkane production. CaO is an inexpensive catalyst which is commonly used for acid esterification reactions and deoxygenation reactions. Alsultan [135] obtained a 72% yield of straight-chain diesel range hydrocarbons (C8-C20) when utilising activated carbon-supported by acidic-basic catalyst (CaO-La2O3) at 330 °C for 180 min in a N2 gas condition. Romero et al. [151] studied the deoxygenation of WCO in batch and semi-batch experiments using CaO and treated hydrotalcite (PURAL MG70) as catalysts at 400 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. The result shows that a single liquid fraction with yield greater than 80 wt% was produced in batch condition, containing a high proportion of hydrocarbons (83%). In the semi-batch conditions, two liquid fractions were obtained after distillation: a light fraction (72–80% hydrocarbon) and an intermediate fraction (85–88% hydrocarbon). However, the produced liquid products in these studies were not extended to assess their potential as substitute jet fuel. Calcium oxide is easily obtained from wastes such as bones and shells and the potential of deoxygenation without the use of H2 gases can significantly reduce the overall cost of production of biojet fuel. Catalyst aside, the catalyst supports also play an important role in the deoxygenation reaction. The role of a catalyst support primarily is to provide better stability for the catalyst by minimizing the leaching problem [152]. The catalyst activity is influenced by the particle size, shape and porosity of the catalyst. Zeolites and activated carbon have often been used as supports for metal catalysts for the deoxygenation of WCO [125,148]. However, given the non-uniform morphology of zeolites, it is difficult to uniformly load metal particles on the support, which may cause carbon deposition during the reaction [153]. The carbon deposition will cause a rapid deactivation of the catalyst, resulting in poor catalytic performance and biojet fuel conversion [154]. Calcination is useful to prevent carbon deposits, while the use of a continuous reactor with a fixed catalyst can also help improve biojet fuel conversion yield [153]. In certain cases, the isomerisation and cracking reactions have been attributed to the Bronsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites of the zeolite support [155]. Most studies evaluate the performance of catalysts rather than their support, since the deoxygenation performance is often influenced by catalytic activity. However, given that the catalyst supports also play a role during the isomerisation and cracking stage, future studies on the effects of catalyst support on biojet fuel production efficiency would be valuable. 4.1.2 Isomerisation and cracking Hydrogenated fuels are usually paraffinic hydrocarbons with high cetane numbers but with poor cold flow properties [124]. The typical hydroprocessing system is also unable to convert low-quality lipids such as high polarity lipids (microbial and algal oil) and high FFA content lipids (WCO) [156]. The hydrotreatment method is often coupled with isomerisation and cracking steps to improve the properties of the fuel produced. Isomerisation converts straight-chain hydrocarbons into branched hydrocarbons, while cracking breaks down the complex long chain hydrocarbons into shorter structures. The isomerisation and cracking processes are capable of improving the cold flow properties, thereby producing a fuel that is more suited for aviation application. Cracking at extremely high temperatures (>600 °C), also known as overcracking, should be avoided as this results in hydrocarbons with shorter chain lengths (C1 to C4). Short-chain hydrocarbons have significantly lower economic values than that of diesel and jet fuel range hydrocarbons [138]. Many researchers have stated that isomerisation activity depends on the acidity of the catalyst and the expected hydrocarbon selectivity [124]. In a typical isomerisation reaction, normal paraffins are dehydrogenated on the catalyst’s metal sites and react on the acid sites to produce olefins protonate with the formation of alkylcarbenium ion, which will be rearranged into branched (mono,di,tri) alkylcarbenium ions, deprotonated and finally hydrogenated into the resulting paraffin [157]. Common catalysts used during the hydrocracking of oil include sulphided forms of silica- and alumina-supported Ni-Mo, Co-Mo and Ni-W. The sulphur addition maintains the catalyst activity but also results in sulphur residue in the final product, H2S emissions and corrosion problems [158]. Besides, the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for cracking WCO was investigated, producing 83 wt% of the organic liquid products with fuel-like properties. The optimal condition was ZrO2 loading of 4 wt%, reaction temperature of 475 °C, residence time of 120 min and heating rate of 10 °C/min [134]. The molecular sieve catalyst, HZSM-5, is also commonly used for the cracking of oils due to its strong acidity, high activity, high shape selectivity and ability to promote deoxidation of oil into hydrocarbons and reactions between acidic components and alcohols of the oils, which ultimately can reduce the viscosity and acidity of the oil products [159]. However, the reaction pathways for isomerisation and cracking of WCO remains unclear. Some studies have shown the feasibility of obtaining diesel range hydrocarbons after hydrotreatment but did not conduct further cracking into jet fuel range hydrocarbons [51,160]."
15,Current challenges and future outlook of WCO biofuels,"Biomass-based biofuels are generally perceived as sustainable and renewable, but some negative impacts such as food security, deforestation and rise in living expenses may occur depending on the feedstock type [161]. In addition, the drawbacks of the biodiesel industry include the high production costs, high crude oil prices and taxation on fuels and energy products [30]. The feedstocks used to produce biodiesel are from refined plant oils or animal fat, account up to 75–80% of the total biodiesel cost, prompting the biodiesel industry to rely on government subsidies to be profitable and to enable the fuels to be affordable to the public [10]. The use of food crops for biofuel production not only imposing stress on water supply and arable land but also incurring food supply problem, in particular in developing countries where the edible oil produced is not sufficient to meet the consumption demand [162]. Hence, attention has been shifted to utilise second-generation feedstock, such as WCO. Given that the repetitive use of WCO for cooking is known to cause health issues and improper disposal leads to various environmental issues, the use of WCO for biofuels for bioenergy production becomes an ideal solution. At present, WCO is a well-established feedstock for biodiesel production, but for biojet fuel production it is still at infancy stage. The following section discusses the challenges faced in the commercialisation of biofuels and relevant policies regarding the use of WCO. Fig. 13 presents the typical supply chain and network involved in biofuel production using WCO."
16,Challenges in production of WCO biofuels,"5.1 Challenges in production of WCO biofuels In 2016, the US Energy Information Administration reported that only 10% of the total energy produced is from renewable sources, where biofuels contributed to a mere 22% [164]. One major challenge for the commercialisation of biofuels is the economic disadvantage when compared to commercial fuels. Although the prices of biojet fuel have dropped significantly in recent years, the price of biojet fuel is double than those of fossil jet fuel, raising the question on the economic viability of biojet fuel production [165]. It is known that the prices of the fuels depend on the crude oil and biomass prices that are subjected to fluctuation, adding considerable uncertainty to the production cost. A viable solution for WCO biofuels would be to implement subsidies to encourage proper disposal and biofuels uptake. For example, the US generates 100 million gallons of WCO each day but offers a sale subsidy of 0.50 USD/gallon for waste oil [13]. The US and Japan enforce strict regulation policies to ensure appropriate WCO disposal [166]. Besides, Japan utilises biodiesel refined from WCO for garbage trucks and supports the sales of biodiesel with consumption taxes, while Brazil and Korea mandated the blends of 5% and 2% of WCO biodiesel with conventional biodiesel respectively [167]. On the other hand, research has shown that the WCO policies in China are more focused on the regulatory and administrative standpoint, with a lack of market-oriented initiatives and funding resulting in a lack of biofuel consumption [166]. Although the enforcement of regulations can improve the WCO disposal issue, only some countries implement both law enforcement and subsidies, suggesting that there is still room for improvement for the potential of WCO biofuels to be fully realised. In EU, WCO utilisation and recovery is currently driven by regulatory framework that boosted the demand for WCO for biofuel production, hence a viable market is established, while at the same time drives the efforts for efficient collection of WCO. A major challenge for WCO biofuels and their viability in the EU market is their relatively high sensitivity on established double counting rules, and a very recent 1.7% cap on WCO biofuels that might lead to reduction of its attractiveness in the member states. Another challenge for the commercialisation of WCO biofuels is the scarcity of supply. The poor recovery rate of WCO is a well-known bottleneck which inhibits the full potential of WCO biofuel production. For example, it is estimated that less than 40% of WCO in China is reprocessed legally, owing to the lack of technical and administrative supervision [14]. Smaller-size restaurants often do not have the proper WCO separation equipment installed due to high cost, lack of space and insufficient daily discharge. Globally, it is estimated that 500,000 tons of WCO is discharged inappropriately to the environment annually [168], which is partly attributed by factors such as poor government supervision, lack of penalty mechanism, high kitchen waste disposal fees and unstimulating subsidies. Zhang et al. [18] compared the recycling rates of WCO for Japan and China and concluded that subsidies for the proper beneficiaries (subsidies for biofuel enterprise instead of recyclers), improvement of current recycling infrastructures, implementation of stricter regulations and an improved sales policy for biofuels would increase the recovery rate of WCO. It has been reported that WCO biofuel production is only limited to small scale production [169], as large scale production of WCO biofuel production is met with logistic challenges such as a low number of collection centres, inadequate facilities, long distance between collection and production points and space constraints [140]. Even if the production of biofuels from WCO is economically feasible, the varying properties and availability of WCO would present a challenge for commercialisation. Wang [170] conducted a techno-economic analysis to analyse the potential feedstocks for biojet fuel and determined that feedstock prices had the most influence on biojet fuel prices. While waste material such as grease has economic benefit, the pre-treatment process will add on to the complexity of processing and increase the production cost. On the other hand, some studies have found that WCO could be converted to biofuels without requiring any pre-treatment [41]. Compared to raw vegetable oils, the triglycerides in the oil break down into FFA during the cooking process, increasing the viscosity, FFA content, saponification number, while the heat and mass transfer between the food and oil results in increased water content [33]. The diversity of oil matrices, varying concentrations of oil constituents and complex structure of degraded components in WCO, require development of more versatile ionization methods, easier sample preparation procedures and accurate mass analyzers for improved characterisation of WCO [8]. In terms of biodiesel production, the use of WCO as a feedstock is still viable, provided that the WCO undergoes a pretreatment process. Depending on the conditions of the WCO, the moisture could be reduced by drying, filtration, distillation, steam injection and sedimentation treatment. The FFA content could be decreased by neutralization, soap separation in a decanter, membrane filtration and solvent extraction, while suspended food particles are separated by filtration [171]. However, given the more stringent regulations for biojet fuel production, it is more challenging to incorporate WCO as a sustainable source for commercial use. Furthermore, the varying degree of saturation of fatty acids in WCO directly influences the H2 required for the hydrogenation reaction [139]. Therefore, the collection of WCO should be more selective and separated into biodiesel or biojet fuel feedstocks."
17,Prospects of WCO biofuels for aviation,"5.2 Prospects of WCO biofuels for aviation The application of WCO for biofuels production has been a well-known concept but has not been fully developed commercially. Besides, biojet fuel production from WCO is still a relatively new concept, with a few flight trials demonstrated by commercial airlines, listed in Table 10 . The aviation sector contributes to approximately 3% of CO2 emissions annually. A study has shown that ~80% of the aviation CO2 emissions were produced from flights that are over 1500 km in distance [172]. Aviation has also contributed 5% of total transport sector emissions in Mexico [173]. In Turkey, based on the country’s Vision 2023 energy and economic targets, the estimated jet fuel demand is in the range of 4.23–7.88 billion litres, of which a mandatory use of 0.31 billion litres of biojet fuel is required [118]. Brazil, the world’s largest producer of biofuels, has collaborated with Boeing, Embraer and local universities to provide a sustainable supply chain of biojet fuel [172]. Over 1500 successful commercial flights from airline companies such as Lufthansa, KLM, Finnair, Iberia, Thomson Airways, Air France, Norwegian, SAS, Alaska Airline and Gol Airlines have been performed with the use of biojet fuel [165]. Aviation emissions has also contributed 30 to 110 g-C per passenger-km, comparable to car transport emissions but much higher than that of bus transport (20 g-C per passenger-km) [173]. It has been projected that the growing global civil aviation fleet will contribute a large percentage of emissions, especially at cruising altitude [174]. The growing concerns over aviation CO2 emissions have led the European parliament to decide to include the aviation sector in the European greenhouse gas (GHG)-emission trading system (EU-ETS), which requires airlines to reduce their GHG emissions by 10% or purchase the CO2 allowance on the open market [126]. A study by Wise et al. [175] found that GHG emissions mitigation by increasing the use of biojet fuel would decrease the carbon emissions in the aviation sector, and could be enhanced with the use of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) systems during the conversion process. There was also a proposed global market-based measure (MBM) by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) known as Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to be implemented in 2021, focusing on the monitoring of GHG emissions in the aviation sector [120]. The aim is to encourage the uptake of biojet fuels by airline companies instead of paying for the GHG emissions. There is considerable effort in promoting the commercialisation potential of biojet fuel. A research group in China managed to produce biojet fuel at a profitable price but find it difficult to implement at commercial scale use due to the strict aviation fuel regulations and lack of interest from the industry [176]. In Europe, it has been reported that SkyNRG is constructing the world’s first biojet fuel production plant, named as DSL-01, which will be dedicated to producing biojet fuel, bio-LPG and naphtha using regional wastes and residue streams as feedstock. The plant is to be completed by 2022 and is projected to produce 100,000 tonnes of biojet fuel and 15,000 tonnes of bio-LPG annually. The production of biojet fuel using waste materials would result in the reduction of CO2 emissions by 270,000 tonnes for the aviation sector [177]. Biodiesel production from WCO often produces glycerol as a by-product, which can be further utilised in the oleo-chemical industry [178], or even as a fuel with significant potential for low-emission combustion that was demonstrated recently [179]. High yields of biodiesel could be produced from WCO by using heterogenous catalysts, making the separation of the catalysts from the final product simpler and more cost effective [180]. A study by Chrysikou et al. [181] reported that co-processing of petroleum fractions with WCO to produce synthetic diesel fuel would reduce production costs and carbon emissions. The use of existing infrastructures makes the co-processing pathway economically viable. Martinez-Hernandez et al. [173] reported that under the current economic scenario, although biodiesel is a more viable investment, biojet fuel production could benefit from the multi-fuel production with reduced risks, provided that the plant is sufficiently large and the price of the feedstocks is low. WCO is a potential biowaste that could potentially be obtained at a low price, thus could partially mitigate the risk associated with biojet fuel production. It is foreseeable that the economic viability of biojet fuel production from WCO could further be improved in the future, given the current extensive research efforts in improving the production process, such as more advanced catalysts, supply chain of WCO, valorising by-products and improve energy efficiency of the process."
18,Technoeconomic feasibility of WCO biofuels,"5.3 Technoeconomic feasibility of WCO biofuels The impact of WCO biofuels on the social-economic and environmental aspects need to be thoroughly assessed. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an informative decision support framework for estimating the complete environmental impact of a product/process [182]. The LCA framework compiles all relevant input and output of a system, estimates their direct and indirect environmental impacts and illustrates the outcome in the inventory and impact assessment stages. LCA framework often consists of two evaluations, mass balance and energy balance, which evaluates and quantifies the products and energy (heat and work produced and required) within the life cycle of the biofuel respectively [183]. LCA has been utilised to assess the environmental impacts of biofuels produced using different catalysts [184], providing key environmental impact indices for the development of a sustainable biodiesel production systems and identifying the optimal operating conditions [182]. A life cycle analysis has been conducted to assess the environmental impacts of WCO biodiesel production, covering the process of collection, pre-treatment, delivery and transesterification. It was found that the transesterification process contributed 68% of the total impact, but the impact could be significantly reduced with the recovery of by-products such as glycerol, fertilizer and methanol [185]. Another study [186] showed that ultrasound-assisted transesterification with methanol:oil molar ratio of 6:1 at 60 °C for 10 min is the optimal operating condition from the environmental perspective that can yield 97.12% of biodiesel. The analysis also included the impact of the production conditions on human health (6.99 × 10−9 Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY)), ecosystem quality (5.64 × 10−4 Potential Disappeared Fraction of species (PDF)*m2*yr), climate change (6.19 × 10−3 kg CO2eq), and resource categories (1.68 × 10−1 MJ primary per MJ biodiesel exergy content produced). Lombardi et al. [187] compared the energy recovery from WCO against various methods of biodiesel production using LCA analysis. They reported that using WCO for biodiesel production via the NaOH-catalysed transesterification method can lead to environmental savings, with cumulative exergy consumption and global warming potential showing 2.4 and 1.3 times more savings respectively, as compared to using WCO as a source fuel for combined heat and power production application. The utilisation of WCO biodiesel also provides economic gain for countries that rely heavily on the import of oil. An economic evaluation of WCO biodiesel production using Aspen Process Economic Analyzer found that Pakistanis would be able to obtain cheap WCO biodiesel with estimated product price of 0.66 USD L−1 as compared to spending 0.99 USD L−1 for petroleum derived diesel [188]. Furthermore, another economic evaluation found that the WCO biodiesel produced via supercritical transesterification could be sold for as low as 0.17 USD L−1 when produced from a 125,000 tonnes/year capacity plant in the Netherlands [162]. The process, which requires no catalyst, soap removal step or pre-treatment, would be financially feasible and sustainable if utilising Netherlands’ 457,440 tonnes of WCO produced each year. However, it is important to note that not all WCO can be fully collected due to improper disposal issues, which could be a potential problem in the case of commercial application. Furthermore, the LCA enables the analysis of the effect of GHG emissions variation attributable to the uncertainty variations of the inputs and outputs. One LCA study has shown that the minimum GHG emission mitigation cost is approximately 200 USD/t of CO2eq irrespective of production method, while 85% of the global carbon offsets is currently priced at less than 10 USD/t of CO2eq, meaning that the cost of biojet fuel is still comparatively high compared to buying emission credits to comply with the CORSIA scheme [189]. An LCA study has shown that the utilisation of WCO as biodiesel feedstock instead of imported biomass feedstock results in reduced environmental impacts, considering crop cultivation, effects on the oil crop market, transportation and energy usage [190]. When comparinglife cycle GHG emissions from WCO biodiesel and conventional diesel used in Thailand, it was found that WCO biodiesel produces 2.35 kg CO2-eq, which is 93% lesser than conventional diesel (32.57 kg CO2-eq) for every 100 km travelled by light duty diesel vehicles [191]. By utilising WCO from households to produce biofuels, the GHG emissions could potentially be reduced by 3089 kgCO2eqt−1 of WCO in an Western Austria esterification plant, with the defined collection system similar to that of the existing ones in Austria [192]. de Jong et al. [189] conducted an LCA study by comparing the GHG emissions from multiple biojet fuel production pathways, including the HEFA of jatropha oil, camelina oil and WCO. It was reported that hydrotreated jatropha (55 gCO2eq/MJ) and camelina (47 gCO2eq/MJ) showed higher emissions per unit of oil than WCO (27 gCO2eq/MJ), which was due to the emissions from crop cultivation and low oil yields. This reflects the advantage of WCO, as no cultivation is involved in the process of hydrotreating WCO, thus it could significantly lower the GHG emissions per unit of oil. On the other hand, EU regulation (RED II) does not leave much room for different interpretations and explicitly lists the methodology for calculation of CO2 emission savings for different biofuels from different feedstock. WCO in this case exhibits 88% CO2 savings in comparison to oil equivalent, while high ILUC risk palm oil biodiesel has a moderate 32% CO2 emission savings. Hence, the LCA data can be used to optimize the fuel-mix in each of the member states to steer between economic and environmental performance."
19,Conclusions,"The current paper discusses the biodiesel and biojet fuel production techniques from WCO along with the challenges and prospects for the biofuels. It has been shown that different regulatory frameworks are imposed by different countries to collect and recycle WCO, providing the opportunity to process the biowaste into fuels. Despite the notable advantages of utilising WCO for biofuel production, there are still certain limitations associated with the feedstock. WCO collection requires strict regulation enforcement, market-oriented initiatives, improvement of recycling facilities and lucrative biofuel subsidies to improve the recovery rate. Commonly investigated WCO biodiesel conversion methods such as microwave-assisted, pyrolysis, ultrasound-assisted and supercritical transesterification face difficulties with upscaling of energy demands. On the other hand, novel methods such as catalytic membrane, magnetic fluidisation, electrolysis and hydrodynamic cavitation generally have poorer conversion efficiency and require long reaction time. There are significantly lesser studies involving WCO for biojet fuel conversion, which is due to varying degree of fatty acid saturation in WCO that affects the hydrogenation reaction, in addition to the stringent jet fuel property standards that need to be fulfilled. Although significant progress has been achieved in the conversion technology of WCO to biofuels, further improvement is needed to further increase the conversion efficiency and lower the energy use. A combination of two process intensification techniques, such as those of ultrasound assistance and magnetic fluidisation has shown synergistic effect that leads to the increase in conversion yields and eases catalyst separation. The use of bifunctional catalysts in WCO biojet fuel production combines the deoxygenation, isomerisation and cracking of the hydrocarbon chain in a single step process would significantly reduce the complexity and production cost. While doing so, the social-economic and environmental aspects as a result of WCO utilisation cannot be neglected. The implementation of proper subsidies for WCO collection, advances in WCO pre-treatment process and fuel production technology, the introduction of subsidy policies, GHG emissions measurement schemes and life cycle assessment studies are needed to ensure a sustainable WCO biofuels production, which can be realised with focused government-level strategies by involving the private sector and relevant stakeholders."
