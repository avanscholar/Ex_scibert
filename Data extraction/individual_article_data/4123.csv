0,Introduction,"Nitrogen assimilation in cyanobacteria has been well characterized under photosynthetic conditions (Flores et al., 2005). Reduction of a mole of nitrate to ammonia requires eight electrons derived from one NADPH and six Fdred (Fig. 1a). Nitrate is typically imported into cyanobacteria cells via a nitrate permease (nrtABCD) which consumes ATP (Omata et al., 1993). The unicellular, marine cyanobacterium examined in the present study, Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 (hereafter Synechococcus 7002), however, contains a high-affinity nitrate/nitrite permease, nrtP (Sakamoto et al., 1999), a major facilitator type protein which relies on ion gradients (H+ or Na+) rather than coupling transport directly to ATP hydrolysis as in nrtABCD. Nitrate uptake in the strain Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which uses an ABC-type transporter, was shown to increase upon osmotic up-shift with NaCl, due to the increase in available cellular energy for import (Baebprasert et al., 2011b). Investigation of changes in the transcript profiles expressed during photoautotrophic growth following ammonia depletion in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803, were identified to be under control of the global nitrogen regulator NtcA and the group 2 sigma factor SigE (Osanai et al., 2006). Genes for sugar catabolic pathways including glycolysis, the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway, and glycogen catabolism were induced by ammonia depletion, and the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), two key enzymes of the OPP pathway, were demonstrated to increase several fold. The consequences of these changes, if any, on the associated proteins or intracellular metabolite fluxes were not described, and thus their metabolic consequences remain unknown in cyanobacteria. There are two distinct ATP-producing pathways that can be used during dark, anaerobic carbohydrate catabolism within Synechococcus 7002, generating reductant as either NAD(P)H or reduced ferredoxin (Fdred). Glucose degradation via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway (denoted “glycolysis”) leads to the production of NADH during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Alternatively, catabolic flux through the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway generates NAD(P)H in two oxidative reactions catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, resulting in ribulose-5-phosphate, which is (2mol) further converted to sedoheptulose-7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is further oxidized by entering lower-glycolysis (Fig. 1c). The net yields per glucose from these competing pathways are two moles of NADH in the case of glycolytic catabolism (Fig. 1b), and yields six moles NADPH plus 1 mole NADH when the OPP and lower-glycolysis pathways are employed (Fig. 1c). These stoichiometries are summarized in Fig. 1d. When a mole of glucose is completely oxidized through the OPP pathway, it yields 12 moles of NADPH (Zhang et al., 2007), but this complete oxidation does not happen under in vivo conditions. Thus, the incomplete oxidation of a mole of glucose using OPP and lower-glycolysis produces 1 pyruvate, 3 CO2 and seven moles of NAD(P)H. The pyruvate generated by either pathway may be further oxidized by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) or the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), generating Fdred or NADH, respectively (Fig. 1b), producing CO2 and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). Including the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, the maximum potential H2 yield via glycolysis-only degradation is four moles of H2, known as the Thauer limit (Thauer et al., 1977), compared to eight in the case of OPP coupled to lower-glycolysis. Dark anaerobic cyanobacteria produce much less than 4 moles of H2 per mole of carbohydrate catabolized; the observed yield remains less than one H2 per glucose equivalent (Das and Veziroglu, 2008). The cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. 7002 which we examine herein excretes other reduced products during dark anaerobiosis, including lactate, alanine, and succinate; only a small fraction of the total available reductant is excreted as hydrogen, equivalent to 0.23 moles H2 per glucose equivalent or roughly 1/48 of maximum theoretical yield (McNeely et al., 2010). Although observations of strain-specific H2 evolution rates and yields have been reported for numerous cyanobacteria, there exists a critical lack of understanding concerning the regulation of metabolic production and utilization of reductant for H2 production in these organisms. Until recently it had been accepted that NiFe-hydrogenases found in cyanobacteria are reduced exclusively by NAD(P)H, based on in vitro studies of similar hydrogenases (Lauterbach et al., 2013). However, it was shown recently that both flavodoxin and ferredoxin can directly reduce the bidirectional NiFe-hydrogenase of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in vitro (Gutekunst et al., 2014). This study also reported that a merodiploid ferredoxin-NADP reductase mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 produced more hydrogen photolytically compared to native strain, consistent with elimination of a competing pathway. This study also showed that reduced ferredoxin generated in vitro by pyruvate:flavodoxin/ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) donates electrons to the NiFe-hydrogenase under fermentative conditions, in agreement with an earlier in vivo study (McNeely et al., 2011). Removal of nitrate from the fermentation medium under dark anoxic conditions, inhibition of nitrate reductase after growth in replete medium, and genetically removing the nitrate/nitrite reductases have all been shown to increase hydrogenase-mediated fermentative H2 evolution in several cyanobacteria. A 4-fold increase in the rate of hydrogen production was also observed in Arthrospira maxima when nitrate was removed from the fermentation medium (Ananyev et al., 2008). Inhibition of the nitrate reductase in Synechocystis 6803 resulted in a similar 4-fold increase in the observed H2 yield (Gutthann et al., 2007). A strain of Synechocystis 6803 lacking both nitrate and nitrite reductases showed a 140-fold increase in H2 production compared to WT in nitrate-replete media (Baebprasert et al., 2011a). These studies indicate that nitrate competes with the reduction of protons for H2 under fermentative conditions in these organisms. As a result, the observed redistribution of excreted metabolites was predicted to be correlated with shifts in the intracellular redox poise (herein defined as the ratio of reduced to oxidized pyridine nucleotides, NAD[P]H/NAD[P]+, as well as the ratio of the reduced to oxidized electron carrier ferredoxin (Fdred/Fdox). Redox control of the redistribution of metabolites might occur via mass action or regulatory influences, although the precise mechanism of control is not investigated in this study. Here we quantify the relative fluxes through glycolysis or OPP during carbohydrate catabolism during dark anoxic metabolism in Synechococcus 7002 and document the redistribution of these fluxes upon nitrate removal from the medium. We show that dark, anaerobic cells in the absence of nitrate preferentially degrade carbohydrate via glycolysis only, while in the presence of nitrate cells catabolize carbohydrate via the OPP pathway in combination with lower glycolysis. This redirection of flux upon nitrate addition produces additional reductant, which is subsequently reoxidized via the nitrate reductase and is not captured by hydrogenase. The more negative redox poise of cells in the absence of nitrate forces carbohydrate catabolism to occur exclusively via glycolysis, which generates less NAD(P)H than the OPP pathway, thereby lowering the redox poise, and excess reductant is vented as hydrogen when this poise exceeds a critical threshold. Ultimately, a systematic relationship between terminal electron acceptor, redox potential, and preference for carbon metabolic pathway has not emerged. Here we provide a quantitative metabolic approach to assess these variables in Synechococcus 7002 under nitrate deprivation."
1,Methods,
2,Growth conditions,"2.1 Growth conditions Cultures of Synechococcus 7002 were grown photoautotrophically in medium A+ (Stevens et al., 1973) supplemented with 2μM NiCl2 to ensure maximal hydrogenase function and sparged with 2% (v/v) CO2 in air. Cells were grown for four days to late exponential phase (OD550 nm ≈2.5) at 35°C in 500mL flasks using fluorescent lighting (Philips 65 WATT) at a light intensity of 200μmol photons m−2 s−1 incident on one side, and were harvested for fermentation."
3,Fermentative conditions,"2.2 Fermentative conditions Cultures were concentrated by centrifugation and washed twice with 50mL medium A (lacking sodium nitrate); the cells were resuspended in nitrate-free medium A or A+ (with 1mM sodium nitrate added). The cultures are referred to by the presence or absence of nitrate in the fermentation medium (denoted “+NO3” or “−NO3”). Cell count was determined from the final OD550 nm values; here 2.56 for +NO3 cells and 2.37 for −NO3 cells. All data were normalized to number of cells, with 1 OD550 nm equivalent to 1.0±0.2×108 cells per mL (Sakamoto and Bryant, 1997). Anoxic conditions were created to induce anaerobiosis; aliquots of cells (7-mL) were placed in 10-mL vials, which were then sealed with rubber septa and wrapped in foil to create dark conditions. The headspace was purged for 15min with argon gas in order to remove the majority of oxygen, and any remaining dissolved O2 was consumed by respiration. Triplicate aliquots were prepared of both +NO3 and −NO3 cells for each time point, at which the headspace gas was sampled using a gas-tight syringe for GC measurement and the vials then opened and cells were separated from the medium by centrifugation (10,000× g) for analysis of the cell-free medium by 1H NMR in ambient air conditions."
4,Analytical assays,"2.3 Analytical assays Hydrogen in the headspace of assay vials was sampled (200μL) with a gas-tight syringe and measured using a Gow Mac series 300 gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector and argon as the carrier gas. CO2 was measured in the headspace of culture vials following acidification of the medium by addition of 200μL of 5M HCl using a similar GC setup, albeit with helium as the carrier gas. Metabolite concentrations in the extracellular medium of fermenting cells were quantified using cryoprobe-assisted proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy on a Bruker Avance-II spectrometer at 500MHz at 22°C with previously established protocols (Carrieri et al., 2009). The medium was spiked with 10% D2O containing 30μgmL−1 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d 4 acid, sodium salt (TSP). Excitation sculpting was utilized for water suppression (Hwang and Shaka, 1995). The peak(s) corresponding to each metabolite was integrated and then normalized to an internal standard (TSP). Quantification of each metabolite was based on a linear calibration curve, ranging from 10μm to 1mM, for each unique metabolite as previously described (Carrieri et al., 2009). Total sugars were assayed using the anthrone assay (Hassid and Abraham, 1957). Briefly, cells were boiled in 70% aqueous sulfuric acid for an hour, at which time the anthrone reagent was added and the cells were boiled an additional 10min. The absorbance was measured at 620nm for the biological samples and standards. Protein was quantified by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma–Aldrich) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium in the cell-free medium were measured by assays employing Berthelot's reaction, nitration of salicylic acid and nitrite azo-coupling, respectively. The ammonium concentration in the medium was determined via Berthelot's reaction (Solorzano, 1969). Briefly, 1mL of a phenol (10g/L) and sodium nitroprusside (0.5%) solution in water was added to 200 uL of sample, at which point 1mL of the 1.5N sodium hypochlorite solution was added. After 1h at room temperature, the absorption was measured at 546nm and NH4 + concentration determined against a calibration curve prepared in A+ medium. Nitrate was determined by nitration of salicylic acid (Cataldo et al., 1975). Briefly, nitrite was removed from samples by adding 50mL amido sulfuric acid (10% w/v) to 1mL of sample and boiling briefly, after which 0.5mL sodium salicylate (5% w/v in conc. sulfuric acid) was added to 200 uL of the nitrite-free sample. After 20min at room temperature, 5mL of 4N NaOH was added. After cooling, the absorption at 420nm and was measured and the NO3 − concentration determined against a calibration curve in A+ medium. The nitrite concentration in the medium was determined by the Griess reaction (Granger et al., 1995). Briefly, 500μL of 60mM sulfanimide (pH=2.4) and 500μL of 4mM N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylendiamine dihydrochloride were added to 100μL of sample. After 10min, the absorbance at 540nm was measured and the NO2 − concentration was determined by a calibration curve in A+ medium."
5,LC/MS,"2.4 LC/MS The metabolomic analysis of glycolysis and OPP pathway metabolites was conducted using Agilent 1200 series HPLC coupled to a Model 6490 QQQ mass analyzer equipped with an ion spray source (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), as previously described (Kumaraswamy et al., 2013). The intracellular concentrations of pyridine nucleotides NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH has been measured using an Agilent 6410 QQQ mass spectrometer coupled to a 1200-Series chromatography system (McNeely et al., 2010). These pyridine nucleotide concentrations were used to derive the intracellular redox poise, which is the ratio of reduced to oxidized pyridine nucleotides, NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+."
6,Results and discussion,"Here we present a quantitative accounting of the consequences of nitrate supplementation under anaerobic metabolism, showing that it specifically drives carbon catabolism to divert from the glycolysis (EMP) pathway to the OPP pathway in Synechococcus 7002, and is correlated with the intracellular NAD(P)H/NAD(P) redox poise. A summary of the proposed metabolism with OPP plus lower glycolysis appears in Fig. 1c together with the stoichiometry of the overall reactions in Fig. 1d. The ATP produced from glycolysis alone is 3 ATP per G6P catabolized, while the yield from OPP+lower-glycolysis is predicted to be 2 ATP per G6P catabolized. The major redox difference between the two pathways is the extent of carbon oxidation and the reduction of pyridine nucleotides. The ratio of reduced to oxidized pyridine nucleotides gives an indication of the thermodynamic driving potential that is available for redox reactions that are in equilibrium with the pyridine nucleotide pools within the cells. Local concentrations of pyridine nucleotides can vary within cells and these differences are responsible for the observed kinetic fluxes, for example as seen in GAPDH mutants of Synechococcus 7002 (Kumaraswamy et al., 2013)."
7,Nitrate uptake and nitrite excretion,"3.1 Nitrate uptake and nitrite excretion Cells were grown to stationary phase (4 days) and re-suspended in either nitrate-free medium or medium containing 1mM nitrate. At the onset of dark anoxia in Synechococcus 7002, nitrate present in the extracellular environment is rapidly imported into the cells and predominantly reduced to nitrite, which is subsequently excreted during dark anaerobiosis (Fig. 2 ). As a control, 1mM sodium nitrate was shown to be stable in A+ medium for 4 days in the absence of cells. Analysis of the +NO3 fermentation medium indicated that 90% (350mol per 1017 cells) of the extracellular nitrate was imported into the cells upon re-suspension, prior to induction of dark anaerobiosis, as only 100μM nitrate was detected in the medium after re-suspension. During 4 days of dark anaerobiosis, the remaining (100μM or 40mol per 1017 cells) nitrate was also imported into the +NO3 cells. Nitrite concentrations (Fig. 2) in the extracellular medium of +NO3 cultures increased throughout dark anaerobiosis, while no such nitrite excretion was observed in the −NO3 cultures. The +NO3 cells excreted nitrite at a constant rate of 70±12mol per 1017 cells per day over 4 days of dark anaerobiosis. The final nitrite concentration in the extracellular medium after 4 days was approximately 0.7mM (270±50mol per 1017 cells), corresponding to conversion of 70% of the initial nitrate in the medium. The absence of nitric oxide-metabolizing enzymes at the genomic levels confirms that this nitrite is generated from nitrate (Takahashi and Yamasaki, 2002). No ammonium was detected in the extracellular medium during the course of dark anaerobiosis (LOD=5μM). A majority of the nitrite formed by nitrate reductase is not further reduced to ammonium via the assimilatory nitrite reductase, despite the fact that the reduction of nitrite to ammonium (E 0 NO2−/NH4+ =+340mV) is more thermodynamically favorable as compared to reduction of pyruvate to lactate (E 0 pyruvate/lactate =−185mV). However, this reduction of nitrite requires 6 reducing equivalents from ferredoxin (Fdred), while the reduction of nitrate requires only 2, and it is thus possible that nitrite is excreted because nitrite reductase is limited by insufficient Fdred as previously proposed (Reyes et al., 1993). In addition, as ammonium acts as an un-coupler of membrane ion gradients, its production is expected to be highly regulated (Packer, 1963). Synechococcus 7002 is not unique in its ability to excrete nitrite. Synechocystis 6803, which contains only the assimilatory nitrate reductase, narB, was reported to excrete nitrite under conditions of mixotrophic and photoheterotrophic growth, during which cells are expected to have a high redox poise (Reyes et al., 1993). It was also shown in Synechocystis 6803, that the nonphosphorylated signal transduction protein PII controls the nitrate utilization under low light intensity by tuning down the nitrate uptake to meet the available reductant capacity (Kloft and Forchhammer, 2005). Additionally, Synechococcus 7924 was shown to excrete 30% of the nitrite produced under CO2-limited photoautotrophic growth conditions, due to the decrease in activity of nitrite reductase under these conditions (Suzuki et al., 1995). The photosynthetic purple nonsulfur bacterium, Rhodobacter capsulatus E1F1 was demonstrated to excrete nitrite during photoautotrophic assimilation of nitrate (Igeno et al., 1995). Additionally excretion of nitrite under anoxic conditions has been observed for non-phototrophic bacteria (DeMoss and Hsu, 1991; Carlson and Ingraham, 1983). Nitrite excretion under anoxia suggests a role for narB as an electron acceptor in dark anaerobiosis. Additional reductant is consumed in the presence of nitrate under anoxia for reduction by narB, and the demand for NAD(P)H should be significantly higher under such conditions. Indeed, our data establish this to be the case, and that excess reductant is generated by a shift in carbon catabolism from the glycolytic pathway to the OPP pathway."
8,Fermentative products,"3.2 Fermentative products The total carbohydrate present in cells was quantified daily via the anthrone assay. The −NO3 cells catabolized 37±4mol of glucose equivalents per 1017 cells over 4 days, while the +NO3 cells catabolized 45±4mol per 1017 cells over 4 days. These values of catabolized carbohydrate are not appreciably different (P >0.1). Protein and chlorophyll assays revealed that neither was degraded during 4 days of dark anaerobiosis (Supporting Information, Fig. 1) in +NO3 and −NO3 cultures, indicating carbohydrate breakdown is the main source of both ATP and reductant during dark anaerobiosis in Synechococcus 7002. Although total carbohydrate catabolism was only slightly greater in the presence or absence of nitrate, these conditions evidenced significant changes in the operative catabolic pathways, as indicated by the distribution of excreted metabolites and intracellular redox poise. The addition of nitrate stimulated a large increase in the yield of NAD(P)H per glucose catabolized. This resulted in 3.3-fold higher reducing equivalents accounted for in the excreted products compared to in the absence of nitrate (Fig. 4a). The total carbon excreted was similar in both nitrate and nitrate-free conditions (Fig. 4b). During dark anaerobiosis in nitrate, nitrite was the major excreted product, comprising 88% of the total observed reduced products on a molar basis. However, cells that were anaerobic in the presence of nitrate excreted a lower yield of H2 and lactate than cells in the absence of nitrate. Fig. 3 shows the hydrogen, lactate and acetate excreted by the cells over 4 days of dark anaerobiosis. The average yields of these products and the corresponding carbon and reductant balances are listed in Table 1 . The flux of reductant derived from carbohydrate catabolism through the pyridine nucleotide pool may flow into different terminal sinks. For example, the −NO3 cultures excreted lactate at a nearly three-fold higher rate than +NO3 cultures, accumulating 2.5 times more lactate in the fermentation buffer after 4 days of dark anoxia. In the absence of nitrate the NADH is predominantly used to produce lactate from pyruvate, competing for electrons with H2 production, as seen by a 5-fold increase in H2 production in a knockout mutant of lactate dehydrogenase in Synechococcus 7002 (McNeely et al., 2010). Evidence for the reversible nature of this reductant flow mediated via the NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ pool was shown by the addition of the “magic mix” of all three autofermentation products (lactate, formate and ethanol) to autofermenting cultures of Arthrospira maxima (Ananyev et al., 2012). This combination accelerated the maximal rate of H2 production and increased the yield by 35%, while being exactly synchronized with the level of intracellular NAD(P)H. Furthermore, thermodynamic equilibrium between these products was shown to exist through the shared NAD(P)H pool as the omission of any one of these carbon fermentation products eliminated the boost in H2 rate and yield. The formation of acetate from pyruvate generates reduced ferredoxin, the electron donor for nitrate reduction, which supports the observed increased production of acetate in +NO3 cultures. The two cultures accumulated small concentrations of alanine, slightly more so in the +NO3 cultures, which also excrete a small amount of succinate. As expected, the −NO3 cultures also excreted hydrogen at a substantially higher rate, roughly 10-fold faster than nitrate-replete cells, which produced only a trace amount of H2. After 4 days of dark anaerobiosis, the −NO3 cultures accumulated 11 times more H2 in the headspace than the +NO3 cultures. There is a significant increase in the rate of hydrogen production in the −NO3 cultures between days 2 and 3. The yield of the primary excreted product for the +NO3 cells, nitrite, is also listed in Table 1. Carbon dioxide, measured in the headspace after acidification of the medium increased over 4 days of dark anaerobiosis in both −NO3 and +NO3 cultures. In +NO3 cultures CO2 accumulated at 3-fold higher average rate and equivalently higher yield over 4 days. Carbon dioxide generated during dark anaerobiosis should be equivalent to acetate on a molar basis if glycolysis is the sole operative catabolic pathway, since CO2 is a byproduct of acetyl-CoA formation. The combined CO2 in the headspace and dissolved in the medium totals 3-fold higher in +NO3 cultures compared to −NO3 cultures, an outcome that is consistent with 3 moles of CO2 plus 1 mole of GAP production by the OPP pathway per glucose equivalent derived from glycogen. The remaining GAP would then be converted to pyruvate via the lower -glycolysis pathway as shown in Fig. 1c. However, because the metabolism of CO2 (+ bicarbonate) during dark anaerobiosis in cyanobacteria is not fully characterized a lower yield of CO2 may arise. In addition to decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate (accounted for as excreted succinate), which are known to be active during dark anaerobic metabolism in Synechococcus 7002 (McNeely et al., 2010), other CO2-metabolizing pathways may also be presence, and therefore an exact balance of CO2 with acetate and succinate is not necessarily expected. A glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) knockout mutant of Synechococcus 7002, generated to reroute glycogen catabolism through OPP pathway evolved only 25% more CO2 in the headspace after four days of dark anaerobiosis (Kumaraswamy et al., 2013). Competition between CO2 reduction and proton reduction (H2 formation) in the cyanobacterium Arthrospira maxima has been shown during dark anaerobiosis (Ananyev et al., 2008). Additionally, CO2 was demonstrated to be an electron acceptor in a ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase knock-out mutant of Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Wang et al., 1993)."
9,Carbon and reductant balance,"3.3 Carbon and reductant balance Fig. 4 and Table 1 summarize the carbon and reductant balances. In Fig. 4a, the dashed circles represent the predicted NADH produced based upon the experimentally measured amount of carbohydrate catabolized, assuming only glycolytic degradation (2 NADH equivalents generated per glucose equivalent consumed). In the absence of nitrate, the 37±4 moles of glucose catabolized is predicted to produce 90 equivalents of NADH exclusively through glycolysis along with the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-coA. This agrees with the observed 90 excreted reductant equivalents (26 H2 +64 lactate) per 1017 cells (Table 1), confirming that glycolysis gives a quantitative accounting of all catabolized carbohydrate and excreted products in the absence of nitrate. In the absence of nitrate, there is slightly more carbon excreted as CO2 than would be expected from glycolysis alone, but this could arise from other cellular metabolisms. In the presence of nitrate, however, combined OPP+lower-glycolysis degradation is required to quantitatively reconcile the observed excreted reductant with that predicted based on carbohydrate degradation, with the narrow dashed circle in Fig. 4 indicating the predicted reductant yield based on 7 NAD(P)H equivalents per glucose equivalent catabolized. For the +NO3 cells, the observed 45±4 moles of glucose that are catabolized, are predicted to produce only 112 NADH equivalents under the glycolysis-only scenario along with oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-coA (Table 1), whereas the observed reductant equivalents from the excreted carbon products (37) and nitrite (270) totals 307 (Table 1). Glycolysis alone cannot account for the total reductant generated in the presence of nitrate by a factor of nearly 3 fold. However, if the observed carbohydrate catabolism occurs 100% via OPP plus lower glycolysis (Fig. 1c) without any flux through the upper-glycolysis branch, than 337 NAD(P)H equivalents are predicted, within 10% of the measured value of 307 excreted reductant equivalents (Table 1). Similarly, the total balance of carbohydrate catabolized vs. carbon excreted in the presence of nitrate in the 100% OPP case are equivalent (270 vs. 268 carbon equivalents, respectively, Fig. 4b). We take this balanced accounting of both carbon and reductant equivalents as strong evidence for carbohydrate catabolism nearly exclusively via OPP plus lower glycolysis when nitrate is in the medium, as represented in Fig. 1c and summarized by the stoichiometry given by the reactions in Fig. 1d. The involvement of OPP has been observed during heterotrophic growth and dark, aerobic respiration of Synechocystis 6803 (Knowles and Plaxton, 2003, Singh and Sherman, 2005). The high proportion of CO2 to excreted organic acids and alcohols in other strains of cyanobacteria even in the absence of nitrate (Moezelaar and Stal, 1994, Oren and Shilo, 1979), suggests that the OPP pathway is actively employed during dark anaerobiosis in certain cyanobacteria strains, as has been suggested in Cyanothece PCC 7822 (Oost et al., 1989)."
10,Intracellular pyridine nucleotide and metabolite pools,"3.4 Intracellular pyridine nucleotide and metabolite pools The intracellular concentrations of the pyridine nucleotides (NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH) were monitored at 12h increments over 48h of dark anaerobiosis and the OPP and glycolytic metabolites were measured after 72h of dark anaerobiosis (Fig. 6). The overall concentration of the labile metabolites of the pyridine nucleotide pool decreases over 48h of dark anaerobiosis (Fig. 5 ). The observed phenomenon of a decrease in the concentration of the entire pyridine nucleotide pool concentration has been observed previously in cyanobacteria (Bennette et al., 2011). These labile metabolites are degraded during the metabolic stress encountered during dark anaerobiosis and the corresponding decline in intracellular biosynthetic activity, a fact that does not explicitly alter the impact of redox poise on metabolic regulation. In both cultures, the initial NADH was slightly lower than NADPH, and ten-fold less than that of NAD+, indicating a low relative redox poise at the onset of dark anaerobiosis. NADH increased continually during dark anaerobiosis in the −NO3 cells, reaching a maximum at 33h following the initiation of anoxia. In the presence of nitrate, however, NADH increased only slightly alongside the same concomitant drops in NAD+ and NADP+ observed under nitrate-free conditions. The redox poise (Fig. 5a) of −NO3 cultures increased to a 14-fold higher level than the +NO3 cultures after 33h. This corresponds with an increase in rate of hydrogen production over 2 days. By contrast, the redox poise of the +NO3 cells remained low and likely directly controls the contribution of OPP during dark anaerobiosis. The enzyme catalyzing the first step of OPP, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), has been shown to be redox-regulated via the well-established ferredoxin/thioredoxin (Fd/Td) system in a diverse array of photosynthetic organisms, specifically in the cyanobacteria Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 and Anabaena variabilis under certain conditions (Cossar et al., 1984, Gleason, 1996, and Udvardy et al., 1984). Additionally, NADPH and NADP+ have been shown to be allosteric regulators of G6PDH in other bacteria (Lendzian and Bassham, 1980; Luzzatto, 1967), and strong feedback inhibition by NADPH was measured in the cyanobacteria-like P1 isoform of G6PDH in chloroplasts (Lendzian and Bassham, 1980). Another enzyme GAPDH, that connects both glycolysis and OPP pathways, was also found to be redox-regulated via NADH, and considered to be a choke point in glycolysis. An overexpression of this GAPDH enhanced the rate of glycolysis while, a GAPDH knockout mutation rerouted glycogen catabolism via OPP and yielded 5.7-fold higher NADPH pools (Kumaraswamy et al., 2013). Redox regulation of these metabolic nodes by either of these mechanisms effectively controls the flux through OPP and is expected to account for the switch from glycolysis to OPP during dark anaerobiosis observed here in Synechococcus 7002. The addition of nitrate as a strong terminal electron acceptor lowers the effective cellular redox poise, releasing the inhibitory regulation of G6PDH and permitting more oxidative carbohydrate catabolism. The OPP pathway metabolites show appreciably higher concentrations when nitrate is present versus absent. 6-phosphogluconate, xylulose-5-phosphate, ribulose-5-phosphate, and erythose-4-phosphate were quantified after 3 days of dark anaerobiosis and were 4.5-, 1.5-, 2.5-, and 15-fold higher, respectively when nitrate was present (Fig. 6 ). In addition, the lower glycolysis metabolites (GAP, 3PG and PEP), which are shared between OPP and glycolysis increase appreciably (6- to 14-fold) after 3 days of fermentation when nitrate is present (Fig. 6), while metabolites from upper-glycolysis did not change. The significant increases in OPP metabolites and lower-glycolysis metabolites suggest that glycogen catabolism is redirected away from the upper-glycolysis pathway through the OPP pathway at glucose-6-P (G6P). This interpretation is directly confirmed by the measured flux changes to terminal products, showing a 3-fold increase in CO2 (OPP product) and 2.3 fold decrease in lactate (via pyruvate from lower-glycolysis) in the presence of nitrate. These changes are close to 3:1 ratio of theoretical product yields for the respective pathways starting from glucose (Eq. 1a and b): There is little change in the total carbon fermentation product yield (Fig. 4b), indicating that a metabolic switch from upper-glycolysis to OPP occurs rather than an augmentation of total flux. This feature together with the accumulation of lower-glycolysis metabolites from GAP and below suggests that flux control through OPP and lower-glycolysis are shared at glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). This conclusion is in agreement with the results from knockout and overexpression mutants of GAPDH (Kumaraswamy et al., 2013)."
11,Energy conversion efficiency,"3.5 Energy conversion efficiency The catabolism of carbohydrate by the OPP pathway during dark anaerobiosis results in a decrease in the H2 Energy Conversion Efficiency (ECE=ratio of combustion enthalpies of hydrogen [286kJ/mol] to carbohydrate catabolized [2805kJ/mol]), due to the presence of a more favorable terminal electron acceptor (NO3) than protons in the intracellular environment. The maximum theoretical ECE for acetogenic glycolysis is 41%, corresponding to the so-called Thauer limit of 4mol H2 per glucose equivalent catabolized to 2mol acetate (Thauer et al., 1977). Here we have observed a change in ECE from 0.7% (+NO3) to 7% (−NO3), due to removal of a competing electron sink."
12,Conclusions,"Improvement beyond the acetogenic limit of 4mol H2 per glucose equivalent would be feasible if the OPP pathway could be used preferentially over glycolysis in the absence of competing electron sinks (nitrate) to generate NADPH. Each mole of glucose catabolized by the OPP pathway can produce up to 12mol NADPH upon complete conversion to 6 CO2, or as summarized in Eq. (1b), up to 7 NAD(P)H if catabolism yields one pyruvate and 3 CO2. If these NAD(P)H are completely converted to H2 and excreted, these would correspond to 100% and 58% of energy conversion efficiency (ECE), respectively. Recent work has highlighted the potential use of genetic engineering in Synechocystis 6803 to remove the nitrate assimilation pathway by knocking out either or both narB and nirA genes that encode nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase, respectively. The mutant strain devoid of both narB and nirA expression produced 140 times more H2 than WT strain of Synechocystis PCC 6803 in BG11 media under presence of nitrate (Baebprasert et al., 2011a). Other genetic engineering strategies have knocked out one of two GAPDH isoforms resulting in partial rerouting of glycogen catabolism via OPP in Synechococcus 7002 and substantial increase of the NADPH concentration. This did boost the yield of excreted H2 to 1.4mol without milking (equivalent for a 12% ECE) (Kumaraswamy et al., 2013). Another successful strategy for increasing fermentative H2 yield is the continuous removal of H2 produced (H2 milking). Application of this strategy to the cyanobacterium Arthrospira maxima, a more productive autofermenting strain, resulted in an 11-fold increase in NAD(P)H concentration and excretion of 4.4mol H2/glucose for a 39% ECE (Ananyev et al., 2012). This conversion consumed 98% of the glycogen in the cell within 7-8 days. These examples suggest that application of these genetic strategies to a more productive autofermentating strain, together with H2 milking can be expected to significantly exceed the current H2 ECE."
