0,Introduction,"Chiral phenolic alcohols and their derivatives are the most important building blocks of asymmetric synthesis of drugs [1]. A number of enzymes, including oxidoreductases, hydrolases and lyases, have been discovered to produce chiral alcohols with significant chemo, regio, and stereoselectivity [2–5]. In particular, carbonyl reductases catalyze the reduction of various ketones to the corresponding chiral alcohols [6–8] which has made considerable contributions to industrial manufacturing of valuable chiral pharmaceutical intermediates including anticancer drugs, anti-cholesterol drugs, β-lactams antibiotics, and other important drugs [9–13]. As compared with the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation reaction catalyzed by precious metals such as ruthenium, rhodium, and iridium, carbonyl reductase-catalyzed reactions have many inherent merits such as high enantioselectivity, environmental compatibility and also mild reaction conditions, and thus attracts increasing attention from the industry [14,15]. However, most naturally occurring enzymes show low activity, poor stability, or limited selectivity towards unnatural substrates, restricting their applications in reactions of industrial interest [16]. Previously a carbonyl reductase (YueD) from Bacillus sp. ECU0013 was found to asymmetrically reduce a range of ketones to their corresponding (R)- and (S)- alcohols [17]. However, the reduction efficiency of YueD towards halogenated acetophenones is far below the required level for industrial applications, despite their importance as drug precursors [18–20]. Another limitation of carbonyl reductase-catalyzed reactions is the requirement of nicotinamide cofactor (NADPH), resulting in an expensive synthesis process. Efficient regeneration of cofactors has been extensively explored to eliminate the addition of exogenous cofactor, which can be categorized into enzyme-coupled system and substrate-coupled system [21]. In redox catalysis systems, the enzyme-coupled strategy is frequently applied. Carbonyl reductases have been coupled with glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) to regenerate NADPH [22–25]. However, the NADPH regeneration efficiency of the GDH-glucose system may not be sufficient, as indicated in a recent study [26]. In this study, we have engineered YueD from Bacillus subtilis WB600 for improved catalysis performance in asymmetric reduction of halogenated acetophenones at high substrate concentrations based on a computational strategy combining substrate enzyme docking with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and introduced GDH with modified reaction condition, using xylose instead of glucose to facilitate efficient NADPH regeneration so as to be eliminate the requirement of exogenous cofactor addition. Co-substrate, temperature and pH were further optimized to examine the application potential of the constructed YueD mutants in the asymmetric synthesis of (R) and (S)-halogenated alcohols."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Strains, medium and chemicals","2.1 Strains, medium and chemicals E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) was selected as the host organism, and plasmid pET30a (Novagen) was used for cloning and expression. gdh and yueD were cloned from the genome of Bacillus cereus Rock3-28 and Bacillus subtilis WB600 respectively and used to construct enzyme-coupled system in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Luria–Bertani (LB) medium containing 0.5% (w/v) of yeast extract, 1% (w/v) of tryptone, and 1% (w/v) of NaCl was used for cultivation of recombinant E. coli. Isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was purchased from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). Acetophenones were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co.,Ltd (Japan). All other chemicals were of analytical grade purity and were commercially available."
3,Cloning and co-expression of yued and gdh in E. coli,"2.2 Cloning and co-expression of yued and gdh in E. coli Genomic DNA of Bacillus subtilis WB600 was extracted and purified using a bacterial genomic DNA Kit (Dongsheng, China). Oligonucleotide primers for yued and gdh were designed according to the published gene sequences of B. subtilis 168 and Bacillus cereus Rock3-28 (NCBI Accession No.: NP_391062 and EEL32290.1). The DNA fragment of yued was amplified with primers 1 & 2 (Table 1 ), double-digested with BamH1 and Xho1 and then inserted into vector pET30a. The resulting plasmid (pET-yued) was transformed into E. coli BL21. The gdh gene fragment was amplified with primers 3 & 4 (Table 1), and cloned into the BamH1/XhoI site of pET30a-yued, generating pET-Y-GDH. After transformation into E. coli BL21, the recombinant cells YueD-GDH were cultivated at 37 ̊C, 220 rpm in 50 ml LB medium containing kanamycin (50 μg mL−1). When the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of the culture reached 0.7–0.8, IPTG as inducer was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM, and incubated at 25 ̊C for a further 16 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 10 min) at 4 ̊C and then washed three times with deionized water for SDS-PAGE analysis."
4,Molecular docking,"2.3 Molecular docking The initial homology model of YueD with NADPH embedded in was constructed using the Modeller 9.12 package. The crystal structure of a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase SDR from Burkholderia vietnamiens (PDB ID: 5if3) was used as a template. The predicted model was then evaluated by model validation servers (RAMPAGE and ERRAT). Molecular docking was performed with the Autodock 4.2 program, using 3-bromoacetophenone as the model ligand and YueD-NADPH complex as the receptor. The YueD substrate binding pocket was examined by comparison with the corresponding X-ray structure of 5if3. To encompass the entire substrate-binding pocket, the searching grid box was set to a size of 60 × 60 × 60 grid points with spacing of 0.375 Å. The box center was set exactly at the OH atom of the catalytic residue Tyr147. The substrate was set as flexible while receptor residues except for Tyr147 and Ser134 were set as rigid. Tyr147 and Ser134 side chains were set as flexible to facilitate the formation of the two catalytic H-bonds between Tyr147/Ser134 and the substrate carbonyl. Ten possible docking conformations of ligands in receptors were obtained using the Lamakian genetic algorithm (LGA) with the maximum number of energy evaluation set to 25,000,000.The resulting conformation of lowest binding energy was chosen as the final model. The figure was generated using the program PyMOL (Delano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA, USA)."
5,Site-directed mutagenesis,"2.4 Site-directed mutagenesis Based on docking results, residues within 10Ǻ to the model substrate 3-bromoacetophenone in the catalytic pocket of YueD were selected for mutagenesis and site directed mutagenesis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using the Quick Change TM kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pET30a plasmid harboring yued and gdh gene was used as the template. The PCR reaction was conducted in 25 μl systems containing 15 ng of template plasmid, 2 μL of dNTP (2.5 mM each), 1 μL of each primer, and 0.5 μL of Primer STARTM HS polymerase. The PCR program was: 98 ̊C denaturation for 1 min, 20 cycles at 98 ̊C denaturation for 10 s, 55 ̊C annealing for 10 s, and 72 ̊C extension for 7 min. The resulting PCR product was purified, digested with Dpn I and ligated to pET30a. After transformation into E. coli BL21 (DE3), positive colonies were screened on Luria-Bertani agar plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The entire mutant gene was sequenced to verify that no other alterations were introduced into the nucleotide sequence."
6,Optimization of bioconversion process catalyzed by the YueD-GDH coupled system,"2.5 Optimization of bioconversion process catalyzed by the YueD-GDH coupled system The general procedure for biocatalytic asymmetric reduction of the model substrate 3-bromoacetophenone was as follows. Each reaction mixture (1.0 ml) contained 100 mM of potassium phosphate buffer, 10 mM of 3-bromoacetophenone, 0.18 g xylose and 0.5 g wet cells. The reaction mixture was incubated at 220 rpm, 25 ̊C and samples were taken regularly. The product and the residual substrate were extracted by ethyl acetate and dried over Na2SO4 for GC analysis. The effect of pH on the activity of cells expressing wild-type and mutant YueD-GDH coupled system was assessed within a pH range of 4–10, using disodium hydrogen phosphate-citrate buffer (4-6), potassium phosphate buffer (6-8) and Tris−HCl buffer (8-10) at 25 ̊C for 24 h. The thermostability was estimated by incubating cells expressing the wild-type and mutant YueD-GDH coupled system in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7) at 20, 25, 30 and 35 °C, respectively. The effect of co-substrate for cofactor regeneration in the coupled enzyme system was evaluated using different sugars (Xylose, Maltose, Sucrose, Arabinose, Cellobiose and Mannitol, 10 mM each) at 25 ̊C, and the pH was maintained around 6.8 by titration of NaOH. The effect of different co-solvents (Dimethyl Sulphoxide (DMSO), Isopropyl alcohol, Isopentanol, Glycerol and Toluene, 10% v/v each) on the reaction activity was also investigated, using different co-solvent."
7,Bio-conversion of 3-bromoacetophenone by purified enzyme,"2.6 Bio-conversion of 3-bromoacetophenone by purified enzyme Protein purification of the wild-type and mutant YueD was performed as described in previous study [27]. The catalytic activity was determined by performing the reduction of 3-bromoacetophenone using an NADPH regeneration system consisting of purified carbonyl YueD and externally added GDH. Each reaction mixture (1.0 mL) was composed of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7), 500 mM 3-bromoacetophenone, 400 μg of the purified YueD or its mutant, 400 μg of purified GDH, 1 M xylose, and 0.1 mM NADP+. The mixtures were shaken for 24 h at 220 rpm and 25 °C. After 24 h incubation, the mixtures were extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 min to facilitate the phase separation. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and subjected to GC analysis."
8,Asymmetric reduction of halogenated acetophenones by wild-type and mutant YueD-GDH,"2.7 Asymmetric reduction of halogenated acetophenones by wild-type and mutant YueD-GDH E. coli BL21 cells harboring the wild-type YueD-GDH or V181 A-GDH were inoculated in 50 ml LB medium (1% NaCl, 1%tryptone, and 0.5% yeast extract, pH 7.2) in a 250 ml flask and incubated at 37 ̊C. IPTG was added at a final concentration of 0.1 mM when OD600 reached 0.7 and the culture were incubated for another 16 h at 25 ̊C. The induced cells were then harvested by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 10 min) at 4 ̊C and washed with 20 mM PBS (pH 7.4). To perform reduction reaction of halogenated acetophenones, 0.5 g wet cells suspended in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) were added to the reaction mixture containing 500 mM substrates, 0.18 g xylose and 10% of DMSO, to a total volume of 1 mL. All reactions were performed in 2 ml eppendorf tubes at 25 ̊C. The reaction mixture was titrated by NaOH to maintain the pH around 6.8. After 24 h of reaction, samples were extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic layer was dried over Na2SO4. The conversion and enantiomeric excess (ee) of the product (eep) were analyzed by chiral gas chromatography (GC) analyses."
9,Analytical methods,"2.8 Analytical methods Chiral analysis of halogenated acetophenones and corresponding alcohols were analyzed by GC-9790 gas chromatography system (Wenling, China) equipped with an FID detector using nitrogen as the carrier gas. The injector and detector temperatures were set at 240 ̊C. Halogenated acetophenones and corresponding chiral alcohols were determined on Hydrodex β-TBDAc chiral column (Macherey-Nagel, Germany, 25 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness). The retention time of the product isomers were compared with the authentic standards or previously published reports [28]."
10,Molecular dynamics simulation,"2.9 Molecular dynamics simulation Both the wild-type and mutant YueD structures were first minimized in SYBYLs- 2.1.1, to eliminate any possible overlaps or clashes. Amber12 suite was used to perform efficient simulations with acceptable periodic boundary conditions. Hydrogen atoms and sodium ions (to maintain the system neutrality) were added to protein using the tleap utility of Amber12. All simulation systems were solvated in a truncated octahedral box of TIP3P explicit water molecules, extended 10 Å outside around the protein. To start the MD simulation, initial structure of the YueD-NADPH-substrate ternary complex was treated as follows: (a) water molecules and counter ions were relaxed to minimize energy during 2500 minimization steps (500 steepest descent steps, 2000 conjugate-gradient steps); (b) the whole system was then minimized without restraints during 20,000 minimization steps (1000 descent steps and 19,000 conjugate-gradient steps). After energy minimization, 400 ps heating up and a 200 ps equilibration in the NVT ensemble at 310 K were performed. This procedure was followed by 500 ps of NPT simulation at 310 K. After equilibration, 150 ns production MD simulation was performed. The pictures were generated with PyMOL and Chimera software."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Expressing recombinant YueD and GDH in E. coli cells,"3.1 Expressing recombinant YueD and GDH in E. coli cells Carbonyl reductase YueD requires large amounts of NADPH in the asymmetric reduction of carbonyl compounds, which limits large-scale production of enantio pure alcohols. To lower the cost, YueD and GDH were cloned on one plasmid to construct a NADPH regeneration system. The bands on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1 ) indicated the proteins were successfully expressed with molecular weights of 27 kDa for YueD and 28 kDa for GDH, which are consistent with values predicted based on their amino acid sequences."
13,Engineering of YueD,"3.2 Engineering of YueD The 3-dimensional structure of YueD was generated in silico using the Modeller 9.12 package on the basis of the crystal structure of a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase SDR (PDB ID: 5if3) from Burkholderia vietnamiens containing a coenzyme NADPH. The applicable steps were taken to check the quality of the generated model. Therefore, the accuracy of the predicted model was subjected to a series of tests, stereo chemical quality was evaluated using Ramachandran plot obtained from the RAMPAGE server. The stereo chemical evaluation of backbone Psi and Phi dihedral angles divulged that 98% fell within the favored regions and 2% of residues were found in allowed regions of Ramachandran plot respectively (Fig. 2 a). Moreover, for our predicted model, the ERRAT score was 97%, indicating a high-quality model (Fig. 2b). ERRAT is used to interpret the statistics of non-bonded interaction between different atoms; the ERRAT score of 50 is normally acceptable for a model. The valid structure was then subjected to engineer for enhanced activity. In order to choose the amino acid residues for site directed mutagenesis, docking of the model substrate 3-bromoacetophenone into the structure of YueD was performed with Autodock 4.2 program. Structural analysis of YueD revealed that the residues building the (catalytic) receptor site are Ser134, Gly135, Ala136, Tyr141, Trp144, Tyr147, Lys151, Gly180, Val181, Met186, Gln187 and Ile190. Among these residues, Ser134, Tyr147 and Lys151 form the catalytic triad. These amino acid residues were therefore excluded from mutagenesis. Another 9 residues (Gly135, Ala136, Tyr141, Trp144, Gly180, Val181, Met186, Gln187 and Ile190 (Fig. 3 a) in the vicinity of 10 Å from the substrate were chosen as the target amino acid residues for mutation. The importance of individual amino acid side chains was then evaluated by alanine scan [29], in which Alanine was individually substituted for each amino acid residues except Ala136, creating 8 single-site mutants (Table 2 ). Six of them showed higher activity than the wild-type YueD in reduction of 3-bromoacetophenone. The conversion and enantioselectivity of these mutants were subsequently measured by chiral GC analysis, revealing a positive mutant V181 A (Fig. 3b)."
14,Effect of co-substrate and co-solvent on YueD-GDH mediated catalysis,"3.3 Effect of co-substrate and co-solvent on YueD-GDH mediated catalysis In whole-cell catalysis involving oxidoreduction, co-substrate is often added instead of expensive cofactor to afford cofactor regeneration [30]. Carbonyl reductases need sufficient amount of NADPH for efficient biocatalysis, which can be regenerated by coupling to GDH, using glucose as co-substrate [22–25]. The activity of YueD without cofactor regeneration system was analyzed, 40.4% conversion was achieved in the presence of 0.2 mM NADPH. To eliminate the Requirement of externally added NADPH, GDH was introduced to regenerate the expensive cofactor. Surprisingly, we found addition of glucose repressed the YueD-GDH mediated asymmetric bioreduction of 3-bromoacetophenone (10 mM) (Fig. 4 a). The inhibition mechanism in enzyme coupled system may be explained by the inhibition of enzymatic catalysis by the co-substrate or its product (cross-inhibition). Some enzymes have been implied to act on the reactants involved in cofactor recycling and catalyze adverse side reactions [31]. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the glucose oxidation product (gluconic acid) on the activity of purified YueD and observed obvious decrease in the conversion upon gluconic acid addition (Fig. 4e), indicating the inhibition of YueD by the product of GDH catalysis when glucose was used as the co-substrate. It has been reported that GDH from Bacillus megaterium has activity towards several other monosaccharides such as d-xylose, d-mannose, d-galactose and d-glucosamine [32], which inspired us to screen for other co-substrates. Among all sugars (Xylose, Maltose, Sucrose, Arabinose, Cellobiose and Mannitol) tested as co-substrate, xylose led to the highest conversion (Fig. 4b). In a previous report, GDH has been engineered to use xylose as substrate to produce xylolite and regenerate NADPH [27]. It is therefore possible that NADPH regeneration was facilitated by GDH-mediated conversion of xylose to xylolite. Upon the addition of 10 mM xylose as co-substrate, the conversion was increased from 57% to 79% and the ee value (96%) of the product remained unaffected. The conversion increased with the concentration of xylose in the range of 5–20 mM and reached more than 93% at 20 mM xylose, however, with further increase of xylose concentration up to 30 mM, the conversion remained almost the same (Fig. 4c). Thus, xylose at a ratio of 2:1 to 3-bromoacetophenone was selected as a co-substrate in subsequent studies. Furthermore, poor solubility of the substrate (344 mg/L) in the aqueous phase prevents enzyme-substrate interaction, resulting in low product concentrations and productivity [33]. Therefore, a series of co-solvent were added to check the solubility of the substrate. Among them, DMSO had the best performance dissolving the 3-bromoacetophenone in the reaction system, achieving a high conversion of 92% (Fig. 3d)."
15,Effect of temperature on bioreduction of 500 mM 3-bromoacetophenone by the wild-type and mutant YueD-GDH,"3.4 Effect of temperature on bioreduction of 500 mM 3-bromoacetophenone by the wild-type and mutant YueD-GDH Temperature is a very important factor in the biocatalytic process, affecting the enzyme activity [11,34]. For the mutant V181 A, the conversion reached above 90% in the temperature range of 20 and 30 ̊C, and the maximum conversion of 97% was achieved at 25 ̊C. The conversion was markedly reduced to 72% when the temperature was further increased to 35 ̊C. For the wild-type YueD, the conversion remained above 60% in the temperature range of 20 and 30 ̊C, and further increasing the temperature to 35 ̊C only slightly affected the reaction, decreasing the conversion to 57% (Fig. 5 a). These results suggested a lower thermal stability of the mutant as compared to the wild type, although the activity is higher. Therefore 25 ̊C was selected as an optimal temperature for further experiments."
16,Effect of pH on bioreduction of 500 mM 3-bromoacetophenone by the wild-type and mutant Yued-GDH,"3.5 Effect of pH on bioreduction of 500 mM 3-bromoacetophenone by the wild-type and mutant Yued-GDH The pH optimization experiment in range of pH 4–10 showed that pH had a remarkable influence on conversion but a negligible effect on ee value (Fig. 5b). Both the wild-type YueD and mutant Val181 Ala showed a better performance at neutral or slightly alkaline conditions. The mutant Val181 Ala achieved a conversion of about 90% (ee 98%) in the pH range of 6–8, and the maximum conversion of 93.8% (ee 99.7%) was observed at pH 7, whereas the wild type had a conversion of above 50% (ee 97%) in the pH range of 6–8. The conversion decreased rapidly when pH was below 6 or above 8.0. Therefore, pH 7 was used as the optimal pH for the rest of experiments."
17,Effect of incubation time on bioreduction of 500 mM 3-bromoacetophenone by the wild-type and mutant YueD-GDH,"3.6 Effect of incubation time on bioreduction of 500 mM 3-bromoacetophenone by the wild-type and mutant YueD-GDH The time courses of 3-bromoacetophenone biotransformation of the mutant or wild-type YueD-GDH were measured to demonstrate the improved activity and stability of the mutant. In general, the reaction proceeded efficiently without any byproduct observed. At substrate concentrations of 500 mM, the reaction catalyzed with the mutant Val181 Ala took 24 h to reach the maximum conversion of 97.2%, while the same reaction catalyzed with the wild-type YueD-GDH showed a conversion of 60% after 24 h (Fig. 5c). Thus the 24 h incubation time was used for further studies."
18,Biotransformation of the model substrate by purified enzyme and analysis of other halogenated acetophenones by whole cells,"3.7 Biotransformation of the model substrate by purified enzyme and analysis of other halogenated acetophenones by whole cells The asymmetric reduction of the model substrate was investigated with whole cells as well as purified enzymes clarify whether complications arising due to presence of cellular metabolites that might be interfering with the bioconversion. The purified enzymes YueD and GDH were used for the reduction of 3-bromoacetophenone and achieved the desire conversion as expected. The wild type achieved 45.6% conversion whereas mutant achieved 93% conversion, confirming activity improvement by the designed mutation (Fig. 5d). The asymmetric transformation of other halogenated acetophenones (2–7) mediated by mutant V181 A-GDH and the wild-type YueD-GDH whole cells were also investigated. In the presence of xylose as co-substrate and DMSO as cosolvent, the mutant Val181 Ala achieved high conversion (85–99%) and excellent enantioselectivity (96-99% ee), whereas the wild-type YueD-GDH showed lower conversion for most of these substrates (Table 3 ). The mutant Val181 Ala showed the ever best results towards substrates 2,3 and 7, converting 500 mM substrates to products at ee >99% with conversion of 92.3%, 99.9% and 92%, respectively. The wild-type YueD-GDH also delivered high conversion of substrate 3 but the ee value (96%) was slightly lower than the mutant. The performance of YueD mutant Val181 Ala was superior in the reduction of halogenated acetophenones as compared with other reported bioreduction systems in terms of substrate concentration, conversion rate and ee [35–38]. Although the carbonyl reductase from Sporobolomyces salmonicolor could reduce several halogenated acetophenones to corresponding alcohols, the conversions were poor (11–120 nmol/mg) and products ee were also low (14–66%) [36]. In the asymmetric reduction of halogenated acetophenones by Cryptococcus laurentii, alcohol products with high ee were obtained, but at low substrate concentrations (<20 mM) [35]. In contrast, YueD mutant Val181 Ala could reduce various halogenated acetophenones to S or R alcohols with high substrate loading, excellent enantioselectivity and satisfactory conversion, making it a competitive and promising biocatalyst for the preparation of optically pure alcohols."
19,Structure basis of activity improvement upon Val181Ala mutation,"3.8 Structure basis of activity improvement upon Val181Ala mutation To shed light on the molecular basis for the activity improvement of mutant Val181 Ala over the wild type, docking and MD studies were carried out. According to the proposed catalytic mechanism of carbonyl reductases, the carbonyl oxygen atom of the substrate forms hydrogen bonds with both Tyr and Ser residues of catalytic triad (Ser, Tyr and Lys), resulting in its protonation by the Tyr residue, followed by the attack of a hydrogen atom from the C4 atom of NADPH to the carbonyl carbon atom of the substrate. In our effort to understanding how the single mutation at residue 181 resulted in such a drastic change of catalytic performance toward the reduction of halogenated acetophenones, the model substrate 3-bromoacetophenone was docked into the structure of the wild-type YueD and the variant Val181 Ala using the Autodock 4.2 program, respectively. The structure of the mutant enzyme was generated in silico by mutation of the wild type in the target position with Swiss-PDB Viewer (http://spdbv.vitalit). Loss of enzymatic activity was reported when the substrate carbonyl oxygen was kept away from the catalytic residues [39]. In the wild-type enzyme, the residue val181 forms a hydrogen bond with Met186, with a distance of 10Ǻ in between, preventing the substrate from forming a proper conformation in the catalytic pocket, resulting in relatively long distance between the substrate and the catalytic residues Ser134 and Tyr147 (10.5Ǻ and 10.2Ǻ, respectively) (Fig. 6 a). This is a clue to support the experimental observation. In contrast, mutation of Val into Ala at site 181 broke its bond with Met186, as a result the catalytic pocket expanded, the two residues (Ala181, Met186) fell apart from each other at a distance >10Ao, the substrate entered the pocket and became close to the catalytic residues, at a distance of 2.1Ǻ from Ser134 and at 5.5Ǻ from Tyr147, respectively (Fig. 6b, c). These findings are in agreement with the experimental observation. Furthermore, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) in MD simulation of the wild-type YueD-GDH and mutant showed a more smooth RMSD curve and less fluctuation at position Val81 in the RMSF graph for the wild-type system as compared to the mutant, indicating that the intermolecular interactions of the catalytic residues in the wild type hold the pocket in a more compact and stable manner (Fig. 6d). These results are in support of the higher thermal stability of the wild type than the mutant observed in the temperature optimization experiment."
20,Conclusion,"In this work, we have designed an efficient and eco-friendly scheme for the synthesis of optically active halogenated alcohols by engineering the carboxyl reductase YueD, followed by construction of the YueD-GDH cofactor regeneration system, and whole-cell catalysis using xylose as the co-substrate. The high enantioselectivity (>99%) and high catalytic activity (85–99% conversion) of mutant V181 A towards halogenated acetophenones demonstrated the efficiency of the semi-rational enzyme engineering strategy. The impressive catalytic performance at high substrate loading (500 mM) without requirement for cofactor supplementation suggests YueD mutant V181 A as a promising biocatalyst for synthesis of optically pure alcohols on an industrial scale."
