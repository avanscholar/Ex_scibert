0,Introduction,"Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) can transform organic compounds, including biomass waste, into fuels, chemicals, electricity, or hydrogen (Pant et al., 2012). Microbial electrolysis cells (MEC) are a type of BES technology for hydrogen production where an external DC power is used to reach the potential needed to evolve hydrogen from the cathode (Logan et al., 2008). In the more widely used setup (two-chamber MEC), an ionic exchange membrane (IEM) or a separator is placed between the anode and the cathode. The IEM in MEC is a physical barrier that separates anodic and cathodic reactions catalyzed by microorganisms while allowing the passage of ionic species, e.g., H+ or OH–, that maintain charge balancing and operation of the cell (Sleutels et al., 2017). The IEM also isolates the anolyte (composed of complex solutions such as wastewater) from the catholyte (solutions containing some supporting electrolyte such as NaCl), where a pure product can be produced (as hydrogen) (Jeremiasse et al., 2010; Cardeña et al., 2018). During the MEC operation, electrons and protons are produced in the anode by an oxidation reaction that is catalyzed by the microorganisms present in the chamber. Then, in the cathode, those protons can be consumed in a reduction reaction (H2 production). Meanwhile, the electrons produced at the anode and consumed at the cathode generate a negative charge that is compensated by the transport of ions across the membrane to maintain electroneutrality (Sleutels et al., 2017). Early work proposed that the electroneutrality in MEC is mainly supported by protons' transport across the cation exchange membrane (CEM), as described previously for similar systems (Rozendal et al., 2006). However, recent work has shown that the transport of charge in MEC is mainly supported by the transport of other cations through the IEM, especially during the first stage. When MEC systems achieve a steady state, most charge transport is through protons and/or hydroxyl ions. Despite this, the energy lost still is high due to transport against the gradient of other cations. Therefore, the addition of chemicals and buffer does not necessarily enhance performance (Sleutels et al., 2017). However, when the anolyte is wastewater at neutral pH, the concentration of protons (~10−4 mM) is 105 times lower than those of other cations (e.g., Na+, K+, NH4 +, Ca2+, and Mg2+), and these cations are transported across the CEM in higher proportion than the protons. The ion transport incurs an additional energy cost because it introduces an additional resistance to ion transport (Rozendal et al., 2006). Nafion (DuPont) is a widely used membrane in bioelectrochemical systems such as microbial fuel cells (MFC) and MEC. Nafion is based on a hydrophobic fluorocarbon backbone to which hydrophilic sulfonate groups (SO3 −) are attached, endowing the membrane with a high cation conductivity (Rozendal et al., 2006). Nafion membranes provide excellent mechanical stability and high proton selectivity. The inert structure of polytetrafluoroethylene makes the membrane resistant to chemical and physical agents (Chae et al., 2008). However, these advantageous mechanical properties present an environmental problem for the disposal of used membranes. Additionally, the high price of Nafion has motivated a search for other inexpensive alternatives (San-Martín et al., 2019). For the MEC scale-up, it is necessary to consider the investment, maintenance, and disposal cost of the IEM. Here, the membranes costs can represent up to 40% of the total expenses of the reactors. Therefore, the use of inexpensive materials is highly recommended (San-Martín et al., 2019). Additional issues that reduce the MEC performance are the internal resistances generated by IEM that lead to a decrease in the current density and fouling of the membrane surface by microorganism growth or inorganic compounds deposition (Lee et al., 2015). Consequently, the use of a low-cost and environmentally friendly membrane is advisable. Membranes made of poly(vinyl) alcohol/chitosan (PVA/CS) are an interesting possible option for MEC. Previous studies of PVA/CS membranes in microbial fuel cells have obtained higher electrochemical performance characteristics than those of the cells using the Nafion membrane, with the advantage of a much lower cost (González-Pabón et al., 2019). PVA/CS membranes have a cost of about 9 USDm- 2, representing less than 2% of the Nafion's fabrication costs (González-Pabón et al., 2019). Also, PVA/CS membranes can be easily disposed due to their biodegradability and non-toxic nature (Lan et al., 2020). Therefore, PVA/CS membranes can be periodically replaced, eliminating the periodical cleaning needed when durable and expensive membranes -as Nafion- are used. In this way, membrane biofouling is not prevented or controlled using a cumbersome cleaning process, but by disposing (eventually inside the same MEC system) the membrane. This work aimed to evaluate the PVA/CS membrane as an alternative to low cost and biodegradable membrane in the MEC systems, as part of a new green chemistry paradigm. PVA/CS membrane is an ion-exchange membrane, similar to Nafion but not highly selective to proton transport due to its high porosity; this characteristic could favor the bioelectrochemical process. In this study, the performance of a two-chamber MEC for hydrogen production was evaluated using a PVA/CS membrane. A commercial membrane (Nafion 117) was used as the control. Acetate was the model substrate. MEC performance was evaluated by analysis of 1) the hydrogen production and organic matter removal, 2) analysis of the electrochemical behavior using chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry and 3) analysis of the energy losses and change in the membrane structure using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)."
1,Material and methods,
2,Ionic exchange membranes,"2.1 Ionic exchange membranes Ionic exchange membranes were used only to separate the cathodic and anodic chambers in the bioelectrochemical reactors. The low-cost PVA/CS membranes were synthesized using solution casting and the solvent evaporation technique (Darbari and Mungray, 2016; González-Pabón et al., 2019). The commercial Nafion® 117 membrane (Nafion, DuPont Co., Wilmington, DE, USA) was employed as the control for comparison with the novel membrane. It is possible to observe some differences in the physicochemical properties of pristine PVA/CS (González-Pabón et al., 2019) and Nafion membranes (Chae et al., 2008). Nafion presents a higher thickness, conductivity, ion exchange capacity and oxygen transfer coefficient (150 µm, 81.0 mS cm−1, 0.88 meq. H+ g−1 and 2.71 × 10−4 cm s−1 respectively) than the PVA/CS membrane (130 µm, 11.3 mS cm−1, 0.11 meq. H+ g−1 and 1.50 × 10−4 cm s−1, respectively). However, the water uptake for the PVA/CS membrane is higher (108.7%) than in the Nafion (23.3%). Prior to the start-up of the MEC reactor, the Nafion membrane was pretreated according to the procedure suggested by Hernández-Flores et al. (2015). The experiments with PVA/CS and Nafion membranes in MECs were carried out for one month."
3,MEC reactors,"2.2 MEC reactors Four two-chamber MECs reactors made of acrylic were used; each chamber has a working volume of 400 mL and 50 mL of headspace (Cardeña et al., 2020). The cathode electrode was nickel foam (5 cm × 5 cm, 95%, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and the anode electrode was graphite felt grade WDF (5 cm × 5 cm, Brunssen de Occidente, México). The projected area for the anode was 0.006 m2, and that for the cathode was 0.005 m2. Titanium wire (diam, 0.5 mm, 99.99%, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used for wiring up the electrodes. The separation between the anode and cathode was 1.5 cm. The membrane was utilized to separate the anodic and cathodic chambers with a surface area of 0.006 m2 (5.5 cm × 5.5 cm). Two MECs were equipped with the PVA/CS membrane (R1 and R2), and the other two MECs were provided with the Nafion membrane (R3 and R4)."
4,MEC operation,"2.3 MEC operation Four bioanodes (R1, R2, R3 and R4) used in the experiments were previously colonized and acclimated to hydrogen production for 70 days using acetate as the substrate. Anaerobic granular sludge was used as inoculum and was retired at the end of the first 30 days. The bioanodes were coupled in the four two-chamber MEC. The tests were carried out in duplicate for PVA/CS (R1 and R2) and Nafion (R3 and R4) membranes to evaluate the hydrogen production in MEC. The experimental strategy consisted of evaluating the performance and integrity of the PVA/CS and Nafion membranes in MECs using COD L−1 (1.0 g) acetate as the model substrate (anolyte) and sodium chloride solution as catholyte. The anolyte solution (per liter) contained the following chemicals: sodium acetate (2.1 g), NaH2PO4·H2O (2.45 g), Na2HPO4 (4.58 g), NH4Cl (0.31 g), KCl (0.13 g), mineral solution (12.5 mL) and vitamin solution (5 mL) at pH 8. The catholyte solution consisted of 125 mM NaCl without pH adjustment. The MECs were operated in the batch mode. At the end of each cycle, the anolyte and catholyte were discharged and replaced with new media. The duration of the fed-batch periods was 24 h. The experiments were conducted under potentiostatic control at 30 °C, and continuously stirring with magnetic bars (175 rpm). All of the potentials reported in this manuscript are given relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode (KCl 3.0 M, +220 mV vs SHE, Radiometer Analytical). During MEC operation, the anodic potential was steadily fixed at + 200 mV using the chronoamperometry technique (Commault et al., 2013) with a VSP Z-01 instrument (BioLogic Science Instruments, France). Cyclic voltammetry was performed between 300 to −700 mV at a scan rate of 1 mVs−1."
5,Analytical methods and microbial community characterization,"2.4 Analytical methods and microbial community characterization Biogas composition (H2, CH4, and CO2) was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (SRI 8610C, USA) with a thermal conductivity detector and a 30 m-long (0.53 mm internal diameter) Carboxen 1010 Plot column operated at 40 °C for 4 min and then heated to 110 °C with an increment of 20 °Cmin−1. The carrier gas used was nitrogen with a flow of 20 mLmin−1. The injector temperature was 90 °C, and the detector temperature was 150 °C. The substrate consumption (acetate) was determined using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B) equipped with an FID flame ionization detector and using a DB-FFAP column (15 m × 530 μm × 1 μm, Agilent). The operating conditions were as follows: the initial temperature of the oven was 60 °C and increased to 90 °C at a rate of 15 °Cmin−1; then, the temperature increased to 170 °C at a rate of 25 °Cmin−1; the temperature of the injector was 190 °C, that of the detector was 275 °C, and nitrogen was used as the carrier gas. The pH and conductivity in the electrolytes were measured daily with a pH meter (edge®, Hanna Instruments Inc., USA) and conductance meter (model 35, Yellow Springs Instrument, USA), respectively. To characterize the microbial community, biomass samples were taken and treated with the PowerSoil® DNA isolation kit (MOBIO, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions for extracting Genomic DNA. The DNA concentration was quantified by spectrophotometry using a NANODrop 2000c (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The DNA was submitted to the Research and Testing Laboratory (RTL, Lubbock, TX, USA) for Illumina MiSeq sequencing, using amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria (primer pair: 28F (GAGTTTGATCNTGGCTCAG) and 388R (TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT). The USEARCH algorithm and UCHIME software were used to remove chimeras, short and singleton sequences, and noise (Edgar et al., 2011). Then, sequences with a length at least equal to or higher than 250 bp and a quality score equal to or>30 were selected. Operational taxonomic units (OTU) were selected using the UPARSE algorithm (Edgar, 2013). The USEARCH alignment algorithm was used to assign a taxonomic identity for each OTU against the RTL database derived from the NCBI database."
6,Calculations,"2.5 Calculations Biogas volume was periodically measured using a eudiometer (inverted cylinder) using acidified water (NaCl saturated solution, pH = 2). Hydrogen volumes was adjusted to 273.15 °K and 1 atm. For the evaluation of the hydrogen production rate (Q, mL H2 Lcat −1 d−1), the cathode working volume was used. Geometric current density (j, A m−2) was calculated per cycle using the projected area of the anode and considering an average of the maximum current for four hours. The following parameters were calculated to evaluate the MEC performance: Coulombic efficiency (CE, %), hydrogen yield (YH2 , mL H2 gacetate-−1), cathodic hydrogen recovery (rcat , %) and overall hydrogen recovery (rH2 , %) following the report by Logan et al. (2008). The potential losses due to the pH gradient (EΔpH ) and ionic voltage drop (Eionic ) were evaluated using the equations proposed by Cardeña et al. (2020). The cathodic potentials were determined in the steady-state of each cycle. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed by the Minitab 18 statistical software. ANOVA was applied to determine the significant differences between the evaluated parameters of the membranes' performance in MEC for hydrogen production. The differences with p-values lower than 0.05 were considered to be significant."
7,Membrane characterization – scanning electron microscopy,"2.6 Membrane characterization – scanning electron microscopy At the end of the experiments, membrane samples of PVA/CS were dehydrated by immersion in solutions with increasing alcohol concentrations from 25 to 100%, followed by sputter-coating with a thin layer of gold (20 nm) using a current of 30 mA for 30 s. Then, the images were obtained using a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM Carl Zeiss NTS SUPRA 40, USA) with an Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy detector (model X-Max, Oxford Instruments, UK). Previous reports have presented the results of the SEM analysis for the Nafion membrane (Suzuki et al., 2016; Flimban et al., 2018)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,PVA/CS membrane characteristics,"3.1 PVA/CS membrane characteristics The proton conductivity (0.0113 S cm−1) and ion exchange capacity (0.11 ± 0.01 meq. H+ g−1) of the PVA/CS membrane are lower than those of Nafion (0.1 S cm−1 and 0.90 meq. H+ g−1). However, the nonproton selectivity and high hydrophilicity in the PVA/CS membrane (water uptake over 100% in contrast with Nafion, which reaches 23%) can benefit ionic transport due to lower ion transport resistance (González-Pabón et al., 2019). Furthermore, the low oxygen transfer coefficient of the PVA/CS membrane (1.50 × 10−4 cm s−1) provides a good separation of the MEC compartments to prevent the mixing of the gases produced in both chambers. This behavior avoids the costs of refining the product (hydrogen) which is necessary for some applications such as in PEM hydrogen fuel cells."
10,MEC start-up and microbial community characterization,"3.2 MEC start-up and microbial community characterization Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to evaluate the anodic biofilms prior to the start-up of the experiment. The voltamperograms of the bioanodes showed that the current density generation increased exponentially at the potentials greater than −450 mV, and oxidation peaks appear in the range of −200 to 200 mV. These results were similar to the results obtained by Zhu et al. (2014) in previous work. CV plots with an oxide-reduction peak at ≅ 160 mV showed bioelectrochemical activity on the colonized graphite felt (Fig. 1 ). Microbial analysis was carried out to determine the viability and microbial types of the electroactive biofilm on the anode surface. The anodes of each MEC reactor (R1, R2, R3, R4) were analyzed (Table 1 ). All of the reactors presented similar microbial compositions. The dominant population was the electrogenic bacterium genus Geobacter sp. with a relative abundance higher than 95%. Geobacter sp. has competitive advantages over other microorganisms in the BES system due to its ability to secrete significantly more polymeric substances for biofilm formation on the electrode surface and to oxidize acetate using the electrode as the electron acceptor (Stöckl et al., 2019). Bacteria species with fermentative metabolisms such as Dysgonomonas sp., Rhodopseudomonas palustris, and Clostridium sp. were also identified with abundances of approximately 0.3%. These species have been previously reported in BES systems (Ferreira Mercuri et al., 2016) and have a wide range of metabolic characteristics. The mediated electron transfer mechanism of Dysgonomonas sp. has been described in previous work (Wang et al., 2017) while Clostridium sp. may have direct electron transfer mechanism by cytochromes (Park et al., 2001; Rabaey and Verstraete, 2005). Rhodopseudomonas palustris can produce electricity through direct electron transfer (Xing et al., 2008), and presents a high metabolic versatility, including photo-autotrophic, photoheterotrophic, chemoautotrophic, and chemoheterotrophic metabolism (Inglesby et al., 2012). Moreover, Bacteroides sp. and Rhodocyclus sp. were identified in the anode electrodes with abundances close to 0.5%. Bacteroides sp. can be associated with the inoculum source (anaerobic sludge) and planktonic microbial communities in BES (Li et al., 2013), and Rhodocyclus sp. has been previously identified in anodic biofilms; however, no studies of extracellular electron transfer have been performed (Xiao et al., 2015). The proportions of the other microorganisms found in the anode biofilm were lower than 0.1%, so that their relevance in the MEC performance was most likely minimal."
11,Performance of MEC using PVA/CS and Nafion membranes,"3.3 Performance of MEC using PVA/CS and Nafion membranes 3.3.1 Current density and hydrogen production The open-circuit potential (OCP) was measured during batch-cycles. The OCP observed in the four MEC (PVA/CS and Nafion membranes) was – 426 ± 5 mV, indicating stable biological reactions and similar anode microbial colonization. The power densities achieved in MEC were 3.08 ± 0.004 and 7.96 ± 0.004 W m−2 for PVA/CS and Nafion, respectively. Chronoamperometry measurements demonstrated the electrical performance for the MEC with PVA/CS and Nafion membranes (Fig. 2 A). The current densities obtained in MEC were 8.31 ± 0.42 and 9.24 ± 0.41 A m−2 for PVA/CS and Nafion, respectively. ANOVA (p-values) obtained to compare the MEC performance with PVA/CS and Nafion membranes are shown in the Supplementary material. H2 yields were 974 ± 116 and 990 ± 84 mL H2 gacetate −1 for PVA/CS and Nafion, respectively, displaying only a slight significant difference (Fig. 2 B). The H2 production rates during the first five cycles were 1277 ± 46 and 1218 ± 38 mL H2 Lcat −1 d−1 with PVA/CS and Nafion, respectively. This decrement in the Q is due to the fouling on the Nafion membrane that reduces the transport of protons to the cathode, decreasing hydrogen production. It has been reported that biofouling occurs on the side of the membrane facing the biological compartment (the anode) (Bakonyi et al., 2018). The volumetric hydrogen production values were 303 ± 14 mL H2 (PVA/CS) and 279 ± 18 mL H2 (Nafion). Similar hydrogen productivities were obtained when a Nafion-117 membrane was used with buffered electrolytes in a previous work (Ruiz et al., 2016). In that study, carbon fiber brushes in the anode and carbon cloth with Pt were used. A current density of 34 mA m−2 and a yield of 1270 mL H2 gacetate −1 were obtained. 3.3.2 Coulombic efficiency, hydrogen recovery and substrate removal No significant differences in the MEC performance were observed for the CE , rcat , and rH2 when the PVA/CS and Nafion membranes were compared (Fig. 3 ). The purity of the hydrogen obtained in the cathodic chamber for both MECs was 100%. Neither methane nor carbon dioxide were detected in the cathodic chamber, indicating that gas crossover between anodic and cathodic chambers did not occur. It has been reported that methane and other gases can be formed in the anodic chamber (Hasany et al., 2016). The CE and rcat were 66–69% and 98%, respectively, for both membranes (Fig. 3), and a similar value was obtained by Jayabalan et al. (2019) using a complex substrate (sugar industrial effluents), achieving organic matter removal of 40–50% and Coulombic efficiencies between 56.6 and 59.2%. However, the rcat was lower (17%) than that obtained in this work despite the use of the same cathode (nickel foam) and Nafion-117 membrane; however, the catholyte for that study was PBS (50 mM) and a more complex substrate was used. Substrate removal values of 74 ± 1% and 67 ± 1% were obtained using PVA/CS and Nafion, respectively (Fig. 3). The acetate removal in MEC with PVA/CS was significantly higher. The 7% increase obtained in the MEC with the PVA/CS membrane may be due to the biofilm growth on the anode side of the membrane. During the experiments, the substrate removal in the anolyte was lower than 70% for both membranes. The incomplete organic matter removal limited the hydrogen production efficiency. The acidification of the anodic chamber can explain such low substrate removal efficiency. Changes in the pH can affect the electroactive biofilm composition and have a strong influence on the microbial metabolism. Yuan et al. (2011) have shown that an anodic pH of 6 affects the electron transfer kinetics of the electroactive biofilm. Wang et al. (2010) observed that acidification in the bioanode (below pH 6.0) decreased the anode potential, resulting in low MEC efficiency. Ruiz et al., 2016 obtained CE and rcat close to 100% when working with Nafion and buffered electrolytes. They also found that when using non-buffered electrolytes in a two-chamber configuration, the pH drop in the anodic chamber is the limitation in hydrogen production. 3.3.3 Evaluation of pH, conductivity, and potential losses in MEC The pH and conductivity were measured for the electrolytes at the start and end of the batch cycles (Table 2 ). The anolyte solution showed acidification at the end of the batch cycles using either the PVA/CS (6.30 ± 0.03) or Nafion (6.02 ± 0.05) membranes. The catholyte pH increased from 6.0 to 13.15 ± 0.05, alkalinizing the cathode solution for both membranes (Table 2). This pH gradient was already reported for the IEM (Rozendal et al., 2007). The pH gradients are due to the reduction–oxidation reactions. In the anodic chamber, the acetate oxidation (Eq. (1) ) generates protons. The protons saturate the anolyte, and the pH decreases. In the cathodic chamber, the water reduction (Eq. (2) ) produces hydrogen and hydroxyl (OH−) ions. The OH− ions saturate the catholyte and increase the pH until alkalinization. (1) C 2 H 4 O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 8 e - + 8 H (2) 2 H 2 O + 2 e - → 2 OH - + H 2 The pH imbalance is also caused by the transport of ions other than protons and hydroxyl ions across the membrane. The IEM are not completely selective for protons or hydroxyl ions (Rozendal et al., 2007). At the end of the batch cycles, the conductivity (mS cm−1) increased by 13.6% for the use of PVA/CS and decreased by 29.6% with the Nafion membrane. For the catholyte, the conductivity (mS cm−1) at the end of operational cycles increased by 22.5% and 51.7% for the cells using PVA/CS and Nafion, respectively. The increase in the anolyte conductivity when using PVA/CS indicates the presence of anion transport (OH–, Cl−) from the cathodic to the anodic chamber across the membrane (Luo et al., 2018). Nonetheless, Nafion is a proton-selective transport membrane, so that anionic transport is limited due to high negatively charged sulfonate groups (-SO3 −) attached to its hydrophobic fluorocarbon backbone (–CF2–CF2–) (Chae et al., 2008). The low conductivity in the anolyte may be due to the accumulation of the Cl− and OH– ions in the cathodic chamber that shows a higher conductivity for the MEC with Nafion than for the MEC with the PVA/CS. On the contrary, PVA/CS allows anionic transport due to its high porosity (González-Pabón et al., 2019). The mechanism to proton transport in PVA/CS membrane is based on the Grotthuss mechanism and the vehicle mechanism. In the Grotthus mechanism, the protons flow through hydrogen bonding (e.g., proton carrier as –NH2, –NH3 + or -SO3H). In the vehicle mechanism, the protons are combined with water molecules to produce hydronium ions (e.g., H3O+, H5O2 +, and H9O4 +) water molecules act as a vehicle for transporting protons (Srinophakun et al., 2017). High conductivity in the catholyte can be favorable for the current generation (Yossan et al., 2013) but is not sufficient for improving the hydrogen MEC (Gil et al., 2003). Acetate removal (74 ± 1%) was higher when PVA/CS membrane was employed in MEC, most likely due to a lower pH gradient between the chambers when using the PVA/CS. Consequently, the OH– ion transfer from the cathode to the anodic solution balances the pH, and conductivity enables major anodic biofilm stability to increase the COD removal (Ye and Logan, 2018). Thus, the anodic chamber is more sensitive to pH changes, explaining the incomplete oxidation of organic matter. Consequently, the role of OH– ions transport is to avoid anode acidification that negatively affects the microbial biofilm. The potential losses in the system represent all of the changes in the potential that occur within the system, i.e., mainly the pH gradient, ionic losses, and cathodic potentials (Table 3 ). The pH imbalance leads to an energy loss; this is the pH gradient potential loss (EpH ). The pH imbalance between the anode and the cathode leads to an overpotential for the reactions at both electrodes and therefore increases the cell voltage required for MEC (Sleutels et al., 2017). The EpH values did not show a significant difference between the MEC with PVA/CS and the MEC with Nafion. However, the ionic voltage drop (Eionic ) associated with the electrolyte resistance (conductivity of the electrolytes) was 24% lower using PVA/CS, even though the Eionic values are significantly lower than the EpH values for both membranes. The cathodic overpotentials (Ecat ) are slightly lower in the MEC with PVA/CS but the difference from the MEC with Nafion is not significant. These potentials correspond to the steady-state in the cycles. Therefore, comparing the potential losses of the membranes, we observed similar behaviors except for the higher ion transport across the PVA/CS membrane. 3.3.4 Long-term performance in MEC with PVA/CS membrane MEC reactors equipped with PVA/CS and Nafion membranes operated in the batch mode for 30 days. After operation for 30 days, the current densities decreased by 20% and 25% in the reactors with the PVA/CS and Nafion, respectively (Supplementary material). The hydrogen production rate was reduced to 17% (PVA/CS) and 12% (Nafion). The drop in the MEC performance may be due to biofouling on both membranes (Fig. 4 ). Biofouling results from the membrane surface growth of a biofilm; this typically occurs on the side of the membrane that faced the compartment containing the biological catalysts (Koók et al., 2019). Microorganisms on the membrane surface can obstruct proton transport, so that a reduction in the ion exchange capacity will be observed (Xu et al., 2012; Moharir and Tembhurkar, 2018). Biofouling was observed on the PVA/CS surface at the end of the experiments using SEM analysis. The anodic side showed two types of microorganisms: 1) bacillus (>1 µm), coccobacillus (>1 µm) and bacillus chains with a length between 5 and 21 µm; 2) coccus with diameters from 0.3 to 0.4 µm (Supplementary material). The biofouling may block the pores, limiting proton transfer (Lin et al., 2013). The fouling layer grows over time, decreasing the performance of the systems and increasing its maintenance cost (e.g., the addition of cleaning reagents and mechanical deep cleaning) (Cheng et al., 2018). These results are significant because they demonstrate the robustness of the PVA/CS membrane, that seems to be able to cope with the real operational pH conditions when complex substrates such as effluents from dark fermentation are used (Cardeña et al., 2018). No growth of microorganisms was observed on the cathodic side of the membranes. However, the deposition of colloidal particles was observed for both membranes on this side (Supplementary material). The biofouling in a Nafion-117 membrane was already observed in the anodic and cathodic sides after six months of operation (Flimban et al., 2018). Similarly, EDS studies revealed the accumulation of cations in the PVA/CS membrane structure. The cations can interact with sulphonic groups in some exchange membranes, generating an interference effect, and decreasing proton transport (Chae et al., 2008; Park et al., 2017). EDS spectrum showed the presence of Zn, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu that are most likely originate from the inoculum and feeding solutions. These metals can be absorbed or adsorbed by the PVA/CS membrane blend, where the amino groups' content enables the chelation of heavy metal ions (Jamnongkan and Singcharoen, 2016; Li et al., 2011; Sahebjamee et al., 2019). These cations also act as an interference in the transport of the protons across the membrane. A membrane cleaning process has been suggested for periods of about six months to obtain stable performance in BES (Flimban et al., 2018). However, cleaning procedures are not a good option for large-scale operations because of the use of chemicals needed for the treatment (Hernández-Flores et al., 2015). A low-cost and biodegradable membrane may be a feasible option to scale-up BES in industrial and environmental applications. Therefore, PVA/CS material is proposed here as low cost and a biodegradable membrane that can be periodically replaced, preventing fouling that inevitably occurs in MEC and MFC systems. That makes PVA / CS membrane conceptually quite different from Nafion or other commercial membranes, which were not designed as a single-use membrane and excelled in chemical, physical, and biological strength, but still suffer from biofouling problems."
12,Conclusions,"The PVA/CS and Nafion membranes showed similar hydrogen production and electrical performance characteristics. PVA/CS membrane shows better ion transfer than Nafion, reducing the pH gradient between the anode and cathode. Additionally, the low cost, easy degradability, and nonfluorine structure of PVA/CS make it environmentally friendly. MECs integrated with PVA/CS showed great potential for solving economic, environmental, and operative problems related to the use of high-cost membranes based on expensive artificial polymers."
