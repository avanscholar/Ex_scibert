0,Introduction,"Benzylamine is widely utilised as a corrosion inhibitor and intermediate in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, detergents and nylon fibres [1]. The conventional manufacturing route via stoichiometric reaction of benzyl chloride with NH3 generates significant quantities of solid waste (e.g. NH4Cl) with HCl and/or Cl2 release [2]. Catalytic hydrogenation of benzonitrile to benzylamine has been examined in the liquid phase over (Al2O3 and SiO2) supported metals (Ni [3,4], Pd [5,6], Pt [7,8], Ru [9] and Co [10]) but the formation of secondary/tertiary amines and toluene as by-products is a decided drawback. The use of NH3 [4,11], a biphasic medium (H2O−CO2 [12], aqueous NaH2PO4−CH2Cl2 [13]) and elevated pressure (10−83 bar) is necessary to inhibit side reactions. A search through the literature has revealed a limited number of studies of gas phase reaction over Cu/MgO [14], Ni/Al2O3 [15] and Pd/Al2O3 [16,17], attaining high benzylamine yields (>70 %) was the main challenge. The catalytic reductive amination of benzaldehyde with NH3 represents an alternative route (Fig. 1 (paths A + B)) to benzylamine. This reaction has been studied using soluble (Rh [18], Ru [19] and Ti [20]) or immobilised (on alumina [21]) metal complexes, supported metals (Pd/C [22], Ru/C [23–25], Ru/Nb2O3 [26] and Ni/SiO2 [27]) and Pt nanowires [28] in the liquid phase (T = 298−408 K, P = 1−65 bar) but we could not find any reported instance of gas phase operation. Reported benzylamine yields are typically in the range 66–86 %. Condensation of benzylamine with benzaldehyde to N-benzylidenebenzylamine (step C) and subsequent hydrogenation (step D) generates dibenzylamine. Toluene formation can occur either through direct hydrogenolysis of benzaldehyde (step E1) or as a result of further transformation of benzyl alcohol (step E2) while benzylideneimine dehydrogenation (step F) results in the formation of benzonitrile [5]. Use of benzyl alcohol as feedstock in a reaction with NH3 has been proposed for benzylamine production in homogeneous (Ru complex) systems operated at high pressure (P NH3 = 7.5 bar) [29]. Application of heterogeneous catalysts (Ru(OH) x /TiO2 [30] and Cu(OH) x /Al2O3 [31]) has been limited to the liquid phase with no detectable benzylamine formation. A move from batch to continuous processes offers a number of advantages in terms of product/catalyst separation, reduced downtime, product quality control and process safety [32]. There has been no reported study of continuous benzylamine production from benzaldehyde or benzyl alcohol. Use of Cu catalysts (copper chromite [33] and Cu/ZrO2 [34]) in the gas phase reductive amination of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol (with NH3) delivered a two-fold higher cyclohexylamine yield than Al2O3 supported Pd, Pt, Ru and Rh. We have assessed the viability of benzylamine production from the reductive amination of benzaldehyde generated via benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation (step G) where the hydrogen released is used for hydrogenation. A continuous tandem dehydrogenation/amination/ reduction represents a significant advancement in terms of sustainable amine production. In prior work [35], we demonstrated that Cu/SiO2 is effective in benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation to benzaldehyde and was accordingly employed in this study to promote the first step of the tandem reaction. Nano-scale supported Au has displayed high selectivity in the reduction of unsaturated functionalities (e.g. –CO and –CN) [36] and negligible activity in gas phase dehydrogenation (at T < 523 K) [37]. Use of Au can facilitate benzylideneimine reduction to the target benzylamine (step B) without promoting dehydrogenation to benzonitrile (step F) or hydrogenolysis to toluene (step E). In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of a Cu/SiO2+Au/TiO2 combination in benzylamine production from a benzyl alcohol/NH3 feed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation and activation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and activation Silica supported Cu was prepared by deposition-precipitation with NaOH (Riedel-de Haën, 99 %) as precipitation agent. The (fumed) SiO2 support (20 g, Sigma-Aldrich) was dispersed in an aqueous Cu(NO3)2 solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 99 %, 0.03 M, 200 cm3). The suspension was stirred (600 rpm) at ambient temperature for 1 h, NaOH (2 M) added dropwise until pH > 10. The mixture was heated to 353 K and aged under vigorous stirring for 4 h to facilitate homogeneous Cu(OH)2 deposition [38]. The solid obtained was separated by filtration, washed with distilled water (until pH = 7) and dried in air at 393 K overnight. The dried sample was calcined in air (at 10 K min−1 to 723 K for 4 h) to generate a supported CuO phase [38]. Synthesis of Au/TiO2 by deposition-precipitation employed urea (Riedel-de Haën, 99 %) as base. An aqueous solution of urea (100 fold excess) and HAuCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99 %, 5 × 10-3 M, 400 cm3) was added to the TiO2 support (15 g, Degussa P25) and the suspension stirred and heated to 353 K (2 K min−1). The pH progressively increased to ca. 7 after 3−4 h as a result of urea thermal decomposition [39]. The solid was separated by filtration, washed with distilled water at ambient temperature until Cl free (based on the AgNO3 test) and dried in 45 cm3 min−1 He at 373 K for 5 h. The catalyst precursors were sieved (ATM fine test sieves) to mean particle diameter =75 μm and stored under He at 283 K. Before reaction, the catalysts precursors were activated in 60 cm3 min−1 H2 at 2−4 K min−1 to 523−543 K and held for 1−2 h; selection of final activation temperature was based on preliminary tests to 800 K. The samples were passivated (before and after reaction) at ambient temperature in 1 % v/v O2/He for ex situ characterisation."
3,Catalyst characterisation,"2.2 Catalyst characterisation Metal loading was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a Shimadzu AA-6650 spectrometer with an air-acetylene flame from the diluted extract in aqua regia (25 % v/v HNO3/HCl). Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and H2 chemisorption were conducted on the CHEM-BET 3000 (Quantachrome Instrument) unit with data acquisition/manipulation using the TPR Win™ software. The catalyst was loaded into a U-shaped Pyrex glass cell (3.76 mm i.d.) and heated in 17 cm3 min−1 (Brooks mass flow controlled) 5 % v/v H2/N2 at 2−4 K min-1 to 523−543 K. The activated samples were swept with 65 cm3 min−1 N2 for 1.5 h, cooled to reaction temperature (498 K) and subjected to H2 chemisorption by pulse (10 μl) titration. The effluent gas passed through a liquid N2 trap and H2 consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In blank tests, there was no measurable H2 uptake on the supports alone. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained using the Micromeritics Gemini 2390p system. Prior to analysis, samples were outgassed at 423 K for 1 h in N2 and the total specific surface area (SSA) obtained using the standard single point BET method. Metal particle morphology (size and shape) was examined by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) on a JEOL 2200FS equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector operated at an accelerated voltage of 200 kV, employing Gatan Digital Micrograph 1.82 for data acquisition/manipulation. Samples for analysis were prepared by dispersion in acetone and deposited on a holey carbon/Ni grid (300 Mesh). Surface area weighted mean metal size (d) was based on a count of up to 800 particles according to (1) d = ∑ i n i d i 3 ∑ i n i d i 2 where ni is the number of particles of diameter di . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis was conducted on an Axis Ultra instrument (Kratos Analytical) under ultra-high vacuum conditions (<10−8 Torr) with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486 eV). The Cu 2p 3/2 and Au 4f 7/2 spectra were collected and binding energies (BE) calibrated with respect to the C 1s peak (284.5 eV)."
4,Catalytic procedure,"2.3 Catalytic procedure Reactions (transformation of benzaldehyde (Fluka, ≥98 %) or benzyl alcohol (Riedel-de Haën, ≥99 %)) were carried out at atmospheric pressure in situ following catalyst activation in a continuous flow fixed bed vertical glass reactor (i.d. = 15 mm) at 448−498 K. A layer of borosilicate glass beads served as preheating zone, ensuring that the reactant was vaporised and reached reaction temperature before contacting the catalyst bed. Isothermal conditions (±1 K) were maintained by diluting the catalyst bed (Cu/SiO2, Au/TiO2 or a physical mixture of Cu/SiO2+Au/TiO2) with ground glass (75 μm). Reaction temperature was continuously monitored by a thermocouple inserted in a thermowell within the catalyst bed. Solutions of benzaldehyde or benzyl alcohol in cyclohexane (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5 %) were delivered to the reactor via a glass/teflon air-tight syringe and teflon line using a microprocessor controlled infusion pump (Model 100 kd Scientific) at a fixed calibrated flow rate. Reductive amination of benzaldehyde was conducted in a co-current flow of carrier (N2 and/or H2) and NH3 (GHSV = 5 × 103 h−1, molar Cu to reactant feed rate (n Cu/F) = 3.6 × 10−1 h). Benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation was conducted in a co-current flow with N2 (GHSV = 1.0 × 104 h−1, molar metal to reactant feed rate n metal/F = 3.8 × 10-3 – 5.0 × 10-2 h). The reaction of benzyl alcohol with NH3 was carried out in a co-current flow of N2 and/or H2 (GHSV = 2 × 103 h−1, n total/F = 2.4 × 10−1 – 2.8 × 10−1 h). In blank tests, passage of each reactant in a stream of H2 or N2 through the empty reactor or over the (SiO2 or TiO2) support alone did not result in any detectable conversion. The reactor effluent was condensed in a liquid nitrogen trap for subsequent analysis using a Perkin-Elmer Auto System XL gas chromatograph equipped with a programmed split/splitless injector and a flame ionisation detector, employing a DB-1 (50 m × 0.33 mm i.d., 0.20 μm film thickness) capillary column (J&W Scientific). Benzylamine (Acros Organics, 99 %), benzonitrile (Acros Organics, 99 %), dibenzylamine (Acros Organics, 98 %), N-benzylidenebenzylamine (Sigma-Aldrich, 99 %) and toluene (Fisher scientific, 99 %) were used without further purification. All gases (H2, N2, O2 and He) were of high purity (BOC, >99.98 %). Reactant (i) conversion (X) is defined by (2) X i ( % ) = [ r e a c t a n t ] i,in − [ r e a c t a n t ] i , o u t [ r e a c t a n t ] i,in × 100 and selectivity (S) to product (j) is given by (3) S j ( % ) = [ p r o d u c t ] j,out [ r e a c t a n t ] i,in − [ r e a c t a n t ] i,out × 100 Yield (Y) to product (j) was obtained from (4) Y j ( % ) = [ p r o d u c t ] j,out [ r e a c t a n t ] i,in × 100 where subscripts “in” and “out” refer to the inlet and outlet gas streams, respectively. Catalytic activity is also quantified in terms of reactant consumption rate (R, h−1), extracted from time on-stream measurements [40] and turnover frequency (TOF, rate per active site) calculated using metal dispersion obtained from STEM analysis. Repeated reactions with different samples from the same batch of catalyst delivered raw data reproducibility and carbon mass balance within ±5 %."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterisation and performance of Cu/SiO2 in reductive amination of benzaldehyde,"3.1 Characterisation and performance of Cu/SiO2 in reductive amination of benzaldehyde The physicochemical properties of Cu/SiO2 are given in Table 1 . The SSA is similar to that (191−199 m2 g−1) reported for (fumed) SiO2 supported Ni [41] and Pd [42]. The TPR profile of Cu/SiO2 (not shown) is characterised by a single positive peak at the final isothermal hold (543 K) with an associated H2 consumption (Table 1) matching that required for Cu2+ reduction to Cu0. Copper particle morphology was analysed by STEM and a representative image is provided in Fig. 2 (IA) where Cu particles exhibit a quasi-spherical shape consistent with the observations of Zhu et al. [43] for Cu/SiO2 prepared by deposition-precipitation. The associated particle size distribution (Fig. 2 (IIa)) is at the nano-scale (1−6 nm) with a surface weighted mean size of 3.1 nm. Hydrogen chemisorption (37 μmol gCu −1 at 498 K) was equivalent to values reported in the literature for Cu/SiO2 (27 μmol gCu −1, [44]) but significantly lower than that reported for hydrogenation catalysts such as Ni/SiO2 (600 μmol gNi −1, [41]) and Pd/SiO2 (120 μmol gPd −1, [42]). This can be attributed to the high activation energy barrier for dissociative adsorption and low binding strength of dissociated hydrogen atoms on Cu due to the filled d band [45,46]. The Cu 2p 3/2 XPS signal (spectrum not shown) at BE =933.2 eV (Table 1) is characteristic of electron deficient (Cu δ + or Cu+) surface species [47]. In the reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones, the H2 and NH3 content in the feed determines surface concentration of reactive species and resultant product distribution and amine production rate [23,48]. The effect of variations in H2 partial pressure (I) and inlet NH3/Benzaldehyde molar ratio (II) on catalytic performance can be assessed from the entries in Fig. 3 . Full conversion of benzaldehyde (TOF = 8 h−1) to benzonitrile (Fig. 1, path A + F) was observed for reaction in N2 and under stoichiometric conditions for benzylamine formation (Benzaldehyde:H2 molar ratio = 1; P H2 = 0.002 atm), indicative of exclusive amination (-CO → –CN via step A) and dehydrogenation (–CN → –C≡N though step F). An increase in H2 partial pressure (from 0.002 to 0.8 atm) resulted in a progressive shift from benzonitrile to a predominant dibenzylamine formation (85 % yield). This suggests a move from dehydrogenation to combined hydrogenation/condensation (paths B + C+D). Suppressed hydrogenation activity in diluted H2 (low P H2) can be linked to the low capacity of Cu to chemisorb/activate H2 (as shown in Table 1). The primary amine (benzylamine) as a strong nucleophile undergoes facile condensation with benzaldehyde (step C) [29] with a predominant formation of N-benzylidenebenzylamine and dibenzylamine at higher H2 partial pressure. An increase in inlet NH3/Benzaldehyde (from 5 to 100) served to increase benzaldehyde conversion with a shift of principal product from toluene to dibenzylamine. This can be linked to competition between NH3 and H2 for surface sites where increased NH3 content in the feed favours benzaldehyde amination with condensation (path A+D) over benzaldehyde hydrogenolysis (step E). Kirumakki et al. [48] observed that increased NH3 concentration promoted cyclohexanone amination and condensation to N-cyclohexylcyclohexanimine over zeolites Hβ and HY (T =523 K). It must be stressed that reaction of benzaldehyde (with NH3) over Cu/SiO2 did not generate any detectable target benzylamine in the product stream, which requires circumventing the condensation reaction (step C in Fig. 1)."
7,Dehydrogenation + reductive amination of benzyl alcohol over Cu/SiO2,"3.2 Dehydrogenation + reductive amination of benzyl alcohol over Cu/SiO2 The use of benzyl alcohol as a feedstock can serve as hydrogen donor via hydrogen release from dehydrogenation (to benzaldehyde), which can initiate reductive amination (Fig. 1). The catalytic response in the conversion of benzyl alcohol (in N2) over Cu/SiO2 as a function of inlet NH3/Benzyl alcohol (ratios selected based on inlet NH3/Benzaldehyde in Fig. 3) is presented in Fig. 4 . Full conversion (TOF = 12 h−1) was achieved at NH3/Benzyl alcohol ≤10. In the amination of alcohols with NH3, alcohol dehydrogenation has been proposed as rate-determining [49]. Decreased conversion at higher NH3 contents in the feed suggests competition with benzyl alcohol for surface active sites that favours ammonia adsorption. Reaction at NH3/Benzyl alcohol = 40 generated benzonitrile as sole product consistent with consecutive dehydrogenation/amination/dehydrogenation steps (benzyl alcohol → benzaldehyde → benzylideneimine → benzonitrile). Fischer et al. [50] have suggested that excess NH3 (>20) favoured 1,3-propanediol amination over unsupported Co catalysts. Formation of N-benzylidenebenzylamine and dibenzylamine at lower NH3/Benzyl alcohol (≤10) establishes the viability of transfer hydrogenation of the intermediate imines to amines using hydrogen released from benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation. Insufficient NH3 supply at the lowest NH3/Benzyl alcohol (= 5) limited the extent of benzaldehyde amination (Fig. 1, step A) with unconverted benzaldehyde in the product stream (Fig. 3 (II)). At NH3/Benzyl alcohol = 10 all the benzaldehyde generated underwent amination/dehydrogenation with a higher (73 %) benzonitrile yield. Hu et al. [51] studying the gas phase amination of ethanol with NH3 (NH3/ethanol = 7–10) over Cu/γ-Al2O3 (T = 523−563 K) reported acetonitrile as principal (>80 % selectivity) product. Toluene formation was promoted in the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde using an external hydrogen supply (step E). However, hydrogenolysis was not a feature of benzyl alcohol transformation. This can be tentatively linked to differences in surface hydrogen content using an external H2 supply as opposed to hydrogen generated from alcohol dehydrogenation. It is important to note that, regardless of inlet NH3/Benzyl alcohol, amination/dehydrogenation to benzonitrile was the prevailing pathway (S Benzonitrile ≥ 61 %). This points to inefficient hydrogenation (Fig. 1, step B) where hydrogen generated from dehydrogenation is not effectively utilised by Cu/SiO2 for amine production. This limitation can be addressed by incorporating a second catalyst to promote hydrogenation to benzylamine. A critical prerequisite is that the second metal must not promote side-reactions. Conventional supported transition metal (Pd, Pt and Ni) hydrogenation catalysts exhibit high activity for the hydrogenation of unsaturated functions (–CO, –C≡N and –CN) but low selectivity due to hydrogenolysis, decarbonylation and denitrogenation [52]. In contrast, nano-scale supported Au has displayed unique hydrogenation chemoselectivity [36,53]. We have established synergism in physical mixtures of Au/TiO2 and Cu/SiO2 where supported Au enhanced selective nitro- hydrogenation rate via utilisation of hydrogen from coupled benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation over Cu [35]. A physical Cu/SiO2+Au/TiO2 mixture was tested in the tandem process with a view to promoting selective hydrogenation of benzylideneimine to benzylamine."
8,Characterisation and performance of Au/TiO2 and a physical mixture of Cu/SiO2+Au/TiO2 in the dehydrogenation + reductive amination of benzyl alcohol,"3.3 Characterisation and performance of Au/TiO2 and a physical mixture of Cu/SiO2+Au/TiO2 in the dehydrogenation + reductive amination of benzyl alcohol The SSA of Au/TiO2 (Table 1) matches that (50 m2 g−1) reported elsewhere [54] for Au/TiO2 prepared by deposition-precipitation. The TPR profiles for TiO2 and Au/TiO2 are presented in Figure S1, Supplementary Material. The profile obtained for TiO2 was featureless, with no evidence of hydrogen uptake or release. In contrast, over the same temperature range, Au/TiO2 exhibited a hydrogen consumption peak (T max =373 K) that exceeded the requirement for Au3+ → Au0 reduction, suggesting partial support (Ti4+ → Ti3+) reduction [55,56]. Gold particle size <10 nm has been identified as an essential requirement for significant H2 uptake and hydrogenation activity [46]. STEM analysis (Fig. 2 (IB) and (IIb)) has established Au size in the 1−6 nm range and a mean (3.2 nm) close to that for Cu on SiO2. Although it has been shown that supported Cu exhibits a greater tendency to agglomerate compared to Au [57], the ultimate metal nanoparticle size can be determined by the metal precursor and the nature of the support. Chlorine-containing (vs. nitrate) metal precursors generate catalysts with lower metal dispersion [58,59] while a lower SSA of the support favours the formation of larger metal nanoparticles [60]. The combined greater SSA of SiO2 (vs. TiO2) and use of Cu(NO3)2 (vs. HAuCl4) in the synthesis of Cu/SiO2 can account for the similar metal size in both catalysts. Hydrogen chemisorption at reaction conditions (498 K) on Au/TiO2 was appreciably greater than that recorded for Cu/SiO2 (Table 1). While Borgschulte et al. [61] also reported greater H2 uptake on Au than Cu films (460−540 K), there is also the possibility of hydrogen uptake by the partially reduced TiO2 support. XPS profile over the Au 4f 7/2 region (Figure S2, Supplementary Material) was characterised by a lower BE (Table 1) than the Au0 reference (BE =84.0 eV) [62]. This can be linked to a high concentration of low coordination sites in small gold nanoparticles [63] and/or electron donation from the support with the generation of surface Au δ- [64]. The performance of Au/TiO2 was assessed against Cu/SiO2 in stand-alone dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol (at 498 K). A significantly lower dehydrogenation rate was recorded over Au (i.e. 3 vs. 42 h−1), consistent with literature that has shown negligible activity for gas phase alcohol dehydrogenation over supported Au at temperatures <523 K [65]. In the reaction of benzyl alcohol with NH3 (in N2) over Cu/SiO2+Au/TiO2, hydrogen generation (via dehydrogenation) is sensitive to Cu content. This hydrogen contributes to benzylideneimine hydrogenation (Fig. 1, dotted arrow). The temporal variation of conversion and product yield is presented in Fig. 5 for two representative Cu/Au molar ratios (5 and 10). Full conversion of the alcohol (X Benzyl alcohol) with a similar product distribution was observed for both Cu/Au ratios over 7 h on-stream. Metal nanoparticle morphology, size distribution and mean size was similar to that which characterised the unused activated Cu/SiO2 and Au/TiO2 catalysts. Indeed, the representative STEM images (Fig. 2 (IC-ID)), associated size histograms (Fig. 2 (IIa-IIb)) and mean nanocrystal size (mean size of Cu =3.1 nm and Au =3.2 nm in Cu/SiO2+Au/TiO2 after reaction) largely coincide before- and after-reaction (Fig. 2 (II) and Table 1). This is consistent with the constant conversion and product distribution with time on-stream. There was no detectable formation of N-benzylidenebenzylamine or dibenzylamine. As in the case of Cu/SiO2 alone, benzonitrile was the principal product (S Benzonitrile ∼ 76 %). However, benzylamine was generated as a significant secondary product with trace quantities of toluene (yield = 4 %). The generation of benzylamine demonstrates that the inclusion of Au/TiO2 facilitated benzylideneimine hydrogenation without further condensation to N-benzylidenebenzylamine and/or dibenzylamine (Fig. 1, steps C and D). This can be attributed to the greater H2 chemisorption capacity of Au/TiO2 relative to Cu/SiO2 (Table 1) that more effectively captures and utilises hydrogen from the dehydrogenation step. Surface composition in Cu/SiO2+Au/TiO2 after reaction was assessed by STEM/EDX elemental analysis. Two low (I-II) and high (III-IV) representative measurements are shown in Fig. 6 , which includes the STEM image containing the sample area that was analysed (see white frame) with the associated EDX spectra (a–d). EDX measurements over large areas (I-II) reveals the presence of Si or Ti while analysis over single metal nanoparticles (III-IV) shows the presence of copper or gold, consistent with segregation of both metals on the surface. The Au/TiO2+Cu/SiO2 combination serves to promote dehydrogenation (to benzaldehyde) and hydrogenation (to benzylamine) on isolated metal sites, inhibiting condensation. We envision a catalytic synergism that is illustrated in Fig. 7 . The supported Cu phase promotes dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde to generate Cu-H species (step IA) [66]. The extracted atomic hydrogen can migrate to the support [67] and across the physical solid/solid grain boundary with Au/TiO2 [67] onto Au sites (step II). Indeed, catalyst + support physical mixtures have been found to contain greater amounts of hydrogen relative to the catalyst alone [68,69]. Zhang et al. [70] described the hydrogenation of pyridine adsorbed on a zeolite by hydrogen generated on a Pt/SiO2 catalyst. Benzaldehyde generated on Cu via benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation reacts with NH3 to form the intermediate benzylideneimine (step III) that can undergo dehydrogenation to benzonitrile (step IV). Benzonitrile formation is favoured where there is limited available surface hydrogen as a result of (i) hydrogen lean conditions (Fig. 3 (I)) or (ii) at high NH3 content in the feed with competition for active sites with benzyl alcohol (Fig. 4). Repulsion between electron-deficient Cu δ + or Cu+ (from XPS analysis) and the polarised –C δ +=N function results in benzylideneimine desorption from copper and transfer to Au. The imine adsorbs on electron-rich Au δ− (step V) and is hydrogenated to benzylamine (step VI). The incorporation of Au serves as an additional and more efficient site for imine hydrogenation while Cu is responsible for alcohol dehydrogenation to benzaldehyde. The generation of amine and aldehyde on two isolated metal sites (Au and Cu, respectively) inhibits condensation with a consequent enhancement of benzylamine selectivity. In order to address the limitations in terms of available surface reactive hydrogen (generated from benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation), we examined the possibility of enhancing benzylamine production by supplying hydrogen (P H2 = 0.04 atm) in the feed; the results are presented in Fig. 8 . Full benzyl alcohol conversion was maintained for 7 h on-stream where the supply of external H2 resulted in a two-fold increase in benzylamine yield (46 %), decreased benzonitrile production with increased toluene and formation of dibenzylamine. As presented in Table 2 , a further increase in P H2 (to 0.08 atm) elevated benzylamine yield (to 58 %) with a consequent increase in condensation-hydrogenation to dibenzylamine and hydrogenolysis to toluene. Provision of H2 in the feed served to increase the available surface hydrogen and hydrogenation of benzylideneimine over Au (Fig. 7, step VI). Condensation/hydrogenation to dibenzylamine (step VII) and benzladehyde hydrogenolysis to toluene (step VIII) over Cu is a feature of a hydrogen rich feed (Fig. 3). Reaction temperature can influence activity and product distribution in reductive amination [33]. The effect of temperature in this tandem reaction system (at P H2 = 0.04 atm) is presented in Fig. 9 . Toluene yield was largely insensitive (ca. 5–10 %) to temperature changes, a result that is consistent with a benzaldehyde hydrogenolysis dependence over Cu on NH3/H2 (Fig. 3), which was constant in this set of experiments. A decrease in temperature from 498 to 448 K served to increase benzylamine yield to 81 %. This can be linked to a facilitated benzylideneimine transfer from Cu to Au (step V in Fig. 7) that limits dehydrogenation (step IV) and condensation (step VII) over Cu while enhancing hydrogenation of benzylideneimine over Au (step VI). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of selective benzylamine synthesis from benzyl alcohol via a tandem dehydrogenation/amination/reduction in continuous gas phase operation. The highest yield (81 %) achieved exceeds that reported for gas phase hydrogenation of benzonitrile over Cu/MgO and Ni/Al2O3 (<70 % yield) [14,15]. Batch liquid phase amination of benzyl alcohol has not resulted in detectable benzylamine formation [30,31]. Efficient utilisation of a H2 lean feed represents a significant advancement in terms of process efficiency and sustainability when compared with conventional hydrogenation using excess H2."
9,Conclusions,"This study has established the viability of a tandem dehydrogenation/amination/reduction route for high throughout production of benzylamine from benzyl alcohol over Cu/SiO2 (Cu size rage = 1−6 nm, mean =3.1 nm) and Au/TiO2 (1−6 nm, mean =3.2 nm). Reductive amination of benzaldehyde (as feed) over Cu/SiO2 generated dibenzylamine as predominant product (yield up to 99 %) with no detectable benzylamine due to facile condensation with benzaldehyde. We have demonstrated transfer hydrogenation for reaction of benzyl alcohol with NH3 (in N2) over Cu/SiO2 using hydrogen from benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation. Benzonitrile was the principal product over Cu/SiO2, indicating a limited hydrogenation capacity. This was addressed by incorporating Au/TiO2 with Cu/SiO2 as a physical mixture. Supported Au exhibited a five-fold higher H2 uptake under reaction conditions. The Au/TiO2+Cu/SiO2 combination served to suppress the condensation reaction and enhanced benzylamine production. We have established a reaction synergism where the supported Cu phase is responsible for coupled benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation/amination and Au facilitates hydrogenation to benzylamine. The formation of the intermediate benzaldehyde and product benzylamine on two isolated metal sites inhibited condensation to N-benzylidenebenzylamine and dibenzylamine. A high benzylamine yield (up to 81 %) in continuous mode was achieved through an optimisation of H2 partial pressure and reaction temperature."
