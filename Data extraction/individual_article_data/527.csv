0,Introduction,"Fuel cells have been widely recognized as one of the cleanest and most efficient alternatives for generating electricity with near zero pollutant emission, high efficiency, low noise, and extensive research is ongoing to improve the reliability and reduce the cost of these electrochemical devices. Most fuel cell types require hydrogen as fuel [1], but hydrogen is more expensive with difficulties of storing it without mentioning transport and distribution compared to traditional hydrocarbon fuels. Direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) have also attracted considerable interest in their application to alternative power sources for automobile and portable consumer electronics [2–5]. DAFCs have several advantages such as their use of liquid fuels, simple construction without a reformer, low weight and low cost. Furthermore, alcohols combustion reaction provides much more electrons than that of hydrogen combustion reaction. Methanol is a promising fuel for DAFCs, but other low-molecular weight alcohols such as ethanol and propan-1-ol are also candidates. Nevertheless, DAFCs have suffered slow kinetics of alcohol electrooxidation on electrode surfaces in spite of great efforts have been made toward the development of catalyst materials [6–9]. One way to improve fuel cells anodic as well as cathodic reactions is to operate at high temperature. This improvement could be achieved by three approaches: i) Reducing the poisoning effect of carbon monoxide. While operating less than 120 °C only a little amount of CO, ca. 10 ppm poison the electrocatalyst [10]. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that CO coverage reduces with increasing temperature, becoming negligible above 140 °C, [10,11]. ii) The overall reactions kinetics increase while rising temperature, leading to fewer amounts of electrocatalysts, and so reducing fuel cell cost. iii) Interlayer diffusion of reactants and products will increase with rising temperature, as a result of fuel state. In other words, gaseous fuels diffuse more effectively than liquid fuels. Furthermore, elevating fuel cell temperature has other benefits, like better evacuation of cell temperature because of the difference between the inside cell and room temperature. In addition, heat could be used in cogeneration system for house heating as an example. By using current proton conducting membrane in today’s technologies, fuel cells operating at high temperature are not feasible. First, they are degradated at 110–130 °C as a result of the glass transition temperature [12]. Second, these membranes conduction is depending on the hydration. In fact, membrane water leaching becomes critical above 120 °C [13,14]. Today, the design and preparation of PEMFCs’ membranes suitable for higher temperature is one of the major challenges facing the fuel cell’s research. Polybenzimidazole membranes are being developed and results exhibit good stability at higher temperatures [15,16]. Others [17–22], introduced composite membranes that can operate at higher temperature. In the same way, several attempts have suggested a new kind of membranes that can replace acid membranes, which are called water-free membranes [23,24]. The first aim of this work was to focus on PEMFCs, but the use of the general theory led us to extend calculations to more elevated temperature fuel cells’ as oxide fuel cell that operate at 1000 °C. These fuel cells are fuelled mainly with hydrogen and they could be fed by alcohols too [25–27]. In this study, we try to show how elevating temperature influences fuel cells’ parameters such as reversible efficiency, electromotive force and specific energy. Fuel cells concerned by the present work are those fed by hydrogen and light weight alcohols having from one to six carbons in their structure. A large number of works has studied the electrooxidation of methanol and ethanol [28–37], more less has been done for propanol and butanol isomers, pentanol and also hexanol [38–43], but in the best of authors knowledge, there are no researches focused on theoretical study of fuel cells gathering such a number of fuels compared to hydrogen fuel cell. This work will lead future researches for using one of these alcohols."
1,Basic thermodynamics of fuel cells,"Fuel cell is composed of two electrodes separated by an electrolyte (Fig. 1 ); the anode where fuel is fed and oxidized: The case where hydrogen is the fuel (1) H 2 → 2 H + + 2 e − The case where methanol is the fuel (2) CH 3 OH + H 2 O → CO 2 + 6 H + + 6 e − Equation (2) can be generalized to any monoalcohol; (3) C n H 2 n + 1 OH + ( 2 n − 1 ) H 2 O → n CO 2 + 6 n H + + 6 n e − At the cathode oxygen is supplied and then reduced according to the following equation: (4) O 2 + 4 H + + 4 e − → 2 H 2 O Leading to the overall reactions: (5) H 2 ( g ) + ( 1 / 2 ) O 2 ( g ) → H 2 O ( l ) (6) C n H ( 2 n + 1 ) OH ( l ) + ( 3 n / 2 ) O 2 ( g ) → n CO 2 ( g ) + ( n + 1 ) H 2 O ( l ) These balances correspond to the complete combustion reaction of hydrogen and alcohol in pure oxygen. These reactions are exothermic. The enthalpy change for the reaction can be calculated knowing standard enthalpy of formation ΔHf° of reactants and products. (7) Δ H r o = ∑ j ξ j Δ H f ( products ) o − ∑ i ξ i Δ H f ( reactants ) o ξ i and ξ j are stoichiometric coefficients. The change on standard entropy reaction is then; (8) Δ S r o = ∑ j ξ j S ( products ) o − ∑ i ξ i S ( reactants ) o The standard free Gibbs energy for the whole reaction at standard conditions (T = 298.15 K and P = 101.3 kPa) is: (9) Δ G r o = Δ H r o − T Δ S r o Table 1 is constructed using thermodynamics data tabulated in Ref. [44]. Calculations are made assuming that released water is in liquid form, whenever, equations (7)–(9) could be used if the product water is steam. In this case we have substituted ΔH°f (water) and S°(water) by ΔHf°(vapour) and S°(vapour), respectively. According to Table 1, we first observe that state equation changes increase in general with the number of carbons in the alcohol (in absolute value). Enthalpy changes define the amount of energy (heat) needed to the total combustion of the fuel, and so to break bonds. Obviously, these ones are numerous when rising the amount of carbons in alcohol and then, require more energy. Second, when the product is vapour, the enthalpy change of reaction is lower than that when liquid water is released at the cathode. This is due to free of heat of condensation. In the former case, ΔH°r is called lower heating value (LHV), while it’s called the higher heating value (HHV) in the latter case. Entropy change in alcohol oxidation reaction is negative when released water is in liquid form, as consequence of reducing disorder. This result is compatible with the number changing of gas molecules. We can note that state equations evolution with alcohols follows boiling temperature course. Alcohol molecules are bonded to each other’s using three kinds of forces, hydrogen bonding, Van Der Waals dispersion forces and dipole–dipole interactions. The hydrogen bonding and the dipole–dipole interactions will be the same for all the alcohols, but the dispersion forces will increase as the alcohols get bigger. Van Der Waals attractions get stronger as the molecules get longer and have more electrons. That increases the size of the temporary dipoles that are set up. That’s why boiling temperature increases with rising of carbons’ number in alcohol. By the same way, we can explain the decrease in boiling temperature from primary to secondary and tertiary alcohols. Dispersion forces reduce as the attached alkyl group to the hydroxyl function, get more and more complicated."
2,Fuel cells’ parameters at standard conditions,
3,Reversible efficiency,"3.1 Reversible efficiency Fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts the internal energy of reactants on work and heat. The first law of thermodynamics states that the change of internal energy is caused by the heat supplied to the system and work done by the system, (10) d U = d Q − d W Considering an isothermal and reversible process, (11) d Q = T d S This, combined with the first law equation, produces: (12) d U = T d S − d W Introducing enthalpy, (13) H = U + P V After differentiation and substitution with (12) and considering an isobaric system; (14) d H = T d S − d W + P d V In a fuel cell, the work output is the sum of a mechanical work associated with the change in gases volume and the electrical work associated with the transport of electrical charges through the external circuit connecting the anode to the cathode thus, (15) d W = d W elec + P d V Substituting in (14), (16) d H = T d S − d W elec Integrating d W elec = − d H + T d S = − d G , we have (17) W elec = − Δ G This formula states that the maximum work achieved by a fuel cell is equal to a loss of free Gibbs energy. Fuel cell reversible efficiency is defined by the ratio of the maximum (reversible) work output generated by the overall reaction to the total energy lost from the fuel [45]. This corresponds to the heat input, (18) ɛ = W elec / Q in Efficiency can then be expressed by (19) ɛ = Δ G / Δ H One can see that the reversible efficiency is a theoretical value being fixed by thermodynamic data. Fuel cell practical efficiency ɛ cell, is lower due to the irreversibility of electrochemical reactions occurring at the electrodes. ɛ cell is a function of the faradic efficiency and the potential efficiency noted ɛF and ɛE , respectively. (20) ɛ cell = ɛ × ɛ F × ɛ E Thus, faradic efficiency due to incomplete oxidation reaction of fuel and potential efficiency related to overpotentials of the oxygen reduction reaction and fuel oxidation reaction are not considered by the work because they are directly in relation with the used catalysts and electrolyte."
4,Equilibrium electromotive force,"3.2 Equilibrium electromotive force The electric potential ΔE of fuel cell is usually referred to the electromotive force; it can be expressed by: (21) e m f = Δ E = − Δ G / n e F The electromotive force of fuel cell decreases due to electrodes polarizations and ohmic polarization. (22) e m f = Δ E − η anode − | η cathode | − i R Polarizations are not considered here, since they are directly related to the experiment."
5,Specific energy and energy density,"3.3 Specific energy and energy density Specific energy is the amount of energy stored in the fuel cell system per unit mass as given in the following; (23) W = Δ G 3600 M M is molar weight of fuel (g mol−1). Considering d, the density of the fuel, the theoretical energy density can be expressed as: (24) W e = W × d The specific energy and energy density are intensive properties; contrast this with free Gibbs energy which is an extensive property. In other words, these parameters are intrinsic characters of the fuel. From data in Table 1, we have calculated fuel cells parameters using formulas (19), (21), (23) and (24). Results for hydrogen and alcohols with a number of carbons from one to six at standard conditions are gathered in Table 2 . Combustion reaction of fuels is assumed to be performed at standard conditions; we assume that released water is in liquid form. However, we also calculated (ɛ g), fuel cell efficiency corresponding to gaseous water out from the cathode. From Table 2, it can be stated that alcohol fuel cell reversible efficiency is much better than hydrogen fuel cell in the standard conditions. Furthermore, when released water is in vapour state, fuel cells reversible efficiency grows due to a higher value of ΔH°r. Also, it appears that fuel cells’ efficiency grows with raising carbons’ number in alcohol. Fuel cells reversible efficiency higher than 100% is related to positive entropy. From (19), (25) ɛ = Δ G Δ H = Δ H − T Δ S Δ H = 1 − T Δ S Δ H Since enthalpy of reaction is always negative, positive entropy leads to efficiency higher than unity. The equilibrium electromotive force for fuel cells fed on alcohols is very close to that of hydrogen fuel cell, especially the one of methanol. Considering the case of primary alcohols, we can see this parameter diminishes with raising the number of carbons in the alcohol. Specific energy of hydrogen is bigger than that of alcohols; this is due to the size of hydrogen molecules, as hydrogen is the most little molecule. We can also note that the energy density of the alcohols is greater than that of hydrogen by three orders of magnitude. It is clear, that this is due to the lower density of hydrogen, which is in gaseous form, contrast this with alcohols; those are in most condensed state. The last parameter can be the key in the fuel choice, in particular in the case of fuel used in car application of fuel cells storage. According to what was introduced in Table 1 about the influence of hydroxyl group position in the alcohol and alcohol structure, we can conclude that alcohols reversible efficiency rises from primary to tertiary alcohols. The equilibrium electromotive force diminishes from primary to secondary and tertiary alcohols. Finally, the energy density grows when hydroxyl group is attached to a secondary carbon atom."
6,Fuel cells’ parameters evolution with temperature,"In this section we will investigate how fuel cells parameters vary with the increase in temperature. In order to execute calculations homogeneously, the following assumptions were made. - Hydrogen and alcohols oxidation reactions are complete. In other words, efficiency’s decrease related to the faradic efficiency is ignored. - Fuel cell temperature is in the range between 298.15 and 1300 K. - Alcohol and released water are in the phase allowed by temperature. That means there is no additional energy for changing the state of both, reactants or products."
7,Enthalpy and entropy changes,"4.1 Enthalpy and entropy changes Using both of Hess and Kirchhoff laws, as well as thermodynamics data tabulated by the database in Ref. [44], we were able to predict enthalpy change and entropy change for the whole reaction at any temperature. This can be summarized by the next: (26) Δ H r = Δ H ° 298 · 15 + ∑ ∫ T 1 T 2 Δ C p r × d T + ( n + 1 ) L v w − L v a (27) Δ S r = Δ S ° 298 · 15 + ∑ ∫ T 1 T 2 Δ C p r T × d T + ( n + 1 ) L v w T e b w − L v a T e b a where; T 1 and T 2 are integration boundaries including necessarily boiling temperature of water or alcohol, Teb a and Teb w are vaporisation temperature of alcohol and water, respectively. Lv a and Lv w are the standard latent heat of vaporisation of alcohol and water, respectively. ΔCpr is the specific heat of reaction given as follows: (28) Δ C p r = ∑ j ξ j C p j ( p r o d u c t s ) − ∑ i ξ i C p i ( r e a c tan t s ) The specific heat of the reaction depends on reactants and products states. At liquid state, specific heat of species is constant. However, while species are in gaseous form, we have first, drawn curves giving specific heat of compounds function of temperature using data tabulated in Ref. [44], then we used fitting option in the graph analysis that provides an equation of a third order polyminal of temperature with error lower than 1%. (29) C p i = a i + b i T + c i T 2 + d i T 3 ai , bi ,ci and di coefficients are tabulated in Appendix, Table A1. Fig. 2 gives a comparison between specific heat changes for hydrogen and methanol combustion, considering specific heat for reactants and products at temperatures in the range between 298.15 and 1300 K. It arises that the specific heat of the global reaction is described by a non-linear system, especially at temperatures before water boiling point. This is mainly due to oxygen’s and carbon’s dioxide specific heat that change largely with temperature, contrast this with the specific heat of alcohols and water. When having reactants and products in gaseous state allow more steady values to specific heat of reaction change."
8,Free Gibbs energy,"4.2 Free Gibbs energy Lutz et al. [46] when studying hydrogen fuel cell performances assume that temperature has no effect on the free Gibbs energy variation. In fact it was considered constant all along the way. This approximation is right since ΔG°r for hydrogen combustion reaction is likely constant, even at high temperature. Meanwhile, free Gibbs energy for alcohols show considerable changes to not consider it as steady along with temperature increment, Fig. 3 . For example, while ∆G°r for hydrogen oxidation reaction system change equal 53.22 kJ mol−1 in the range between 298 and 1300 K, it is equal to 174.994 kJ mol−1 for propan-1-ol and 2438111.6 kJ mol−1 for 2-methylpropan-1-ol. Because of the complexity of formulas developed here (Appendix A1), a computer program was built with Fortran 90 using database [44] containing thermodynamic information on all fuels studied in this work. By giving the fuel and the temperature, the program gives all parameters classified in a table. So we had just to plot curves."
9,Fuel cell reversible efficiency versus Carnot’s engine efficiency,"4.3 Fuel cell reversible efficiency versus Carnot’s engine efficiency Carnot’s engine describes an ideal operating of motors. The Carnot cycle works between two tanks, one at higher temperature and the second at lower temperature. The maximum efficiency ɛ c of energy conversion process which occur due to heat flow is defined by the Carnot limit [47]; (30) ɛ c = 1 − T h / T l where Th is the maximum temperature of fluid in a heat engine, and Tl is the temperature at which heated fluid is released (colder temperature). In this case, Tl is 298.15 K. Fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts the energy of reaction into electricity, so it should be suitable to compare the ideal reversible efficiency of fuel cells to Carnot’s engine. We perform calculations related for both Carnot’s efficiency and fuel cells’ efficiencies. For these ones we used previously introduced equation (19). However values of the enthalpy change and entropy change are calculated at the operating temperature using Appendix A1. Results are gathered in Fig. 4 . From Fig. 4, it can be noted that hydrogen fuel cell reversible efficiency is lower than the one of alcohols on the whole range of temperature. This observation has not considered the evolution of pent-1-ol curve at temperatures higher than 600 K, which seems lower than hydrogen fuel cell’s efficiency. At low temperature, we can observe that reversible efficiency values for alcohols are close. This is compatible with what we observed at standard conditions. The curves show two breaks which result in changing state for alcohols and water. At water boiling temperature point, one can distinguish a swift rise in reversible efficiency’s values for all alcohols’ curves. This is the result of releasing of heat of condensation, as explained earlier in Section 2. Hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell’s reversible efficiency that appears in Refs. [46,48] doesn’t contain this break because authors assume gaseous water product. Starting from water boiling point, curves related to ethanol, butan-1-ol and pentan-1-ol decrease, while those of methanol and propan-1-ol increase. From the boiling temperature of water, and with few extra hundreds of degrees, alcohols’ reversible efficiency exceeds unity. This was well explained by Appleby and co-authors [49]; they said that reactions with a higher efficiency like this would absorb additional heat from the surroundings and converting this heat to an additional electrical energy as long as the heat could be supplied. Fig. 5 compares the reversible efficiency of propanol’s and butanol’s isomers. The curves of propan-1-ol and its single isomer, which is a secondary alcohol, both are similar. Butanol isomers curves are likely close below their boiling temperature. The discrepancy appears after that: when the secondary and tertiary alcohols fuel cells’ reversible efficiency grows identically, primary alcohols namely butan-1-ol and 2-methylpropan-1-ol, decrease with higher temperature. To understand this feature, we compared the enthalpy ΔHr and the entropy ΔSr changes for all isomers. We found that ΔHr remains almost constant. However, ΔSr is negative at high temperature. Consequently, entropy change drives reversible efficiencies of butanol isomers. Takky et al. [50] when they studied the electrooxidation of butanol isomers in alkaline solution found that butan-1-ol and 2-methylpropan-1-ol activity behave relatively similar. Their findings are in agreement with this work and confirm that butanol isomers behavior is closely related to their structure. We can also accept that alcohols with boiling temperature under that of water give an increasing reversible efficiency, while those with higher boiling point have similar change in efficiency, if ignoring the case of ethanol. Carnot’s efficiency is low at small temperatures then it grows with rising temperature. However, it remains generally inferior to alcohols’ and hydrogen’s fuel cells reversible efficiency. Heat engine is limited by temperature that means efficiency may achieve maximum value when the lower temperature is equal to 0 K. This is not plausible since we can’t find a cooling reservoir at this temperature. As stated before, when the entropy change of reaction is positive, the system will absorb heat from the surroundings and convert it on work which leads to efficiency higher than unity. In order to make the closest comparison with Carnot’s engine, in which efficiency does not exceed 100% authors in Ref. [46], proposed to include the absorbed heat from the surroundings in equation (19). In this case, (31) Q i n = { − Δ H r , i f Δ S r ≤ 0 − Δ H r + T Δ S r , i f Δ S r > 0 We applied these formulas to calculate alcohols fuel cells’ reversible efficiencies. Fig. 6 only shows a superior limit for efficiency at unity. However, this figure shows clearly once again the high reversible efficiency of fuel cells fed with alcohols. We mention that elevating fuel cell’s operating temperature have as effect to keep the high reversible efficiency reached at middle temperatures; except for the cases of ethanol, butan-1-ol and 2-methylpropan-1-ol."
10,Electromotive force change with temperature,"4.4 Electromotive force change with temperature Equation (22) shows that the electromotive force is linearly related to the free Gibbs energy. So, emf follows this latter change with temperature increment. As shown in Fig. 7 , the electromotive force of fuel cells supplied with alcohols at temperature below 373.15 K are in agreement with those at standard temperature, in other words, emf decreases with rising number of carbons in the alcohol. From another side, the electromotive force for hydrogen decreases considerably in the beginning, then slightly with increasing temperature. One can note that the most electromotive force curves for alcohols are steady and didn’t change that much until ca. 450 K. Only for the cases of pentan-1-ol, 2-methylpropan-1-ol, butan-1-ol and ethanol where we can spot a fall on emf values along with the interval. For the other alcohols, this parameter stays closely regular. This could be attributed to the contribution of enthalpy and entropy within free Gibbs energy changes. In the former case entropy dominates while in the latter case, enthalpy dominates."
11,Specific energy change with temperature,"4.5 Specific energy change with temperature Specific energy values for alcohols, as noted at standard conditions, are low compared to that of hydrogen, Fig. 8 . Elevating temperature doesn’t have a positive effect on this parameter even when alcohols are in gaseous state. In addition, we can see that, except the case of 2-methylpropan-1-ol and butan-1-ol, the course of specific energy curves is likely constant. Specific energy increases from C1 to C5. The course of curves corresponding to the specific energy of alcohols contains two parts; at temperatures lower than 373.15 K, the curves are in a straight decrease. Conversely, at greater temperatures specific energy values increase or decrease depending on the alcohol."
12,Discussion,"Before attempting to discuss the different results obtained here, it is opportune to review other sides than thermodynamic’s side of fuels. Hydrogen is very attractive its reaction produces only water. The second advantage of hydrogen is that it can be used with “zero carbon emission” by utilizing energy from nuclear power stations or by renewable energy generating sources. However, the very low density of hydrogen imply it must be compressed, liquefied or stored in a chemical or a physical bonded form, so a viable method for storing hydrogen on the board of vehicles is still to be established [51–53]. For example in both cases of hydrogen storing, liquid and high-pressure hydrogen storage, there is an inevitable energy loss due to the refrigeration process, and pressuring step, respectively. So, the final price of hydrogen is then slightly higher [54]. Hydrogen drawbacks are not limited to storage but they are extended to production and distribution, that is why liquid fuels can be of interest particularly alcohols. All these fuels have in common that they are simple to handle, have a high energy density, are easy to store on board of vehicles and can use the existing distribution and refueling infrastructure. However, C-containing fuels product CO2, which is a greenhouse gas. Methanol and ethanol could be produced from renewable sources as from biomass and by fermenting sugar-rich raw materials from agriculture, respectively, that make their production processes safer. Author in Ref. [55], gave a large survey on the most studied liquid fuels in fuel cells, from environmental concerns point of view. Regarding to methanol, ethanol, propan-1-ol and propan-2-ol, and their hazardous by-products, he concluded that ethanol and propan-2-ol will be the most adequate fuels. Total alcohols electrooxidation is the main barrier to their use as fuels in fuel cell. In the most relevant studies comparing C1 to C3 alcohols, when using platinum, methanol has been found to have a high performance [56,57]. Nevertheless, when platinum like catalysts or platinum binary or ternary catalysts are involved, ethanol and propanol isomers especially propan-2-ol, seem to be more suitable than methanol [58]. Now if we recall the main calculation facts, we can say that (i) The specific energy, the energy density and the electromotive force decrease, in the same time efficiency grows with increasing carbons’ number in the alcohol. (ii) Hydrogen reversible efficiency is lower than that of alcohols at standard conditions and the same trend is observed up to 600 K (iii) Alcohols’ reversible efficiency is very high and in particular at water boiling point and above. (iv) The electromotive force of fuel cell supplied with methanol stands out from other alcohols’ fuel cells. (v) Other alcohols such as ethanol, propanol’s isomers, butan-2-ol and 2-methylpropan-2-ol also show good values for the emf as long as temperature increases. (vi) While hydrogen electromotive force is higher than that of alcohols except near standard temperature. (v) Specific energy of hydrogen is up to three times higher than that of alcohols along with the studied interval of temperature. Following Demirci [55] reasoning, we chose to gather alcohols and hydrogen features in Table 3 . In addition to the efficiency, the specific energy and the electromotive force for fuels at low, medium and high temperature, production, transport and distribution and hazardous characters are compared. For the harmful effect of fuels we decided to use the threshold limit value (TLV), this parameter quantify the impact on human health. Corrosive or flammability characters of fuel were not taken into account because it is widely regarded that any fuel could be used as a safe fuel if properly managed. Also, we didn’t include the reaction kinetic parameter, because fuels have different behaviours, whether they are electroxidized in alkaline or acidic media, depending in the used electrocatalyst and temperature too. Furthermore, in production column the existing renewable process was sufficient to include it. In other words, we didn’t invoke the production costs. For the calculated parameters, it can be proposed three domains of temperature; T1, T2 and T3 as 298.15 < T1 < 373.15 K; 373.15 ≤ T2 < 600 K; 600 K ≤ T3 < 1300 K. From Table 3, we can say that ethanol, methanol and hydrogen are more suitable at low temperature. Hydrogen would be the most adequate fuel in a compromise between the calculated parameters and the production transport/storage and the human health concerns. Ethanol, methanol, propanol and propan-2-ol are suggested for higher temperatures up to 600 K. Methanol, ethanol, propanol isomers, 2-methylpropan-2-ol and butan-2-ol are most convenient at higher temperature. It is clear that the impact on human health has contributed for a lot in the total of points gathered for a fuel. Ethanol which is recognized as a green fuel is placed at the first position at low temperature. It’s obvious that if ignoring transport and distribution drawbacks, hydrogen will be an ideal fuel."
13,Conclusion,"In this work, we gave a detailed theoretical study for fuel cells parameters using thermodynamic and mathematical fundamentals. We calculated the reversible efficiency, electromotive force, specific energy and energy density for fuel cells fed with hydrogen and alcohols from C1 to C6 at standard conditions. Calculations were extended to higher temperature. Taking into account other features related to the production, the transport/storage and the effect on human health, we could do a selection on fuels. There is a real competition between hydrogen ethanol and methanol at low temperature. Despite transport and storage issues, hydrogen is the most indicated fuel for lower temperature. However, methanol, ethanol, propanol isomers, 2-methylpropan-2-ol and butan-2-ol are more indicated at higher temperature while, hydrogen is not convenient for such high temperature. This is in quite agreement with the general trends, actually adopted. Because of the lack of data, we didn’t calculate the effect of temperature on energy density, which could be done in future work."
