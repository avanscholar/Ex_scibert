0,Introduction,"The conversion of synthesis gas to higher alcohols has recently attracted increasing interest due to favorable properties of higher alcohols for applications like fuels, fuel additives and chemicals. The products derived from synthesis gas depend strongly on the reaction conditions and catalysts [1], leaving only a small parameter window for the synthesis of higher alcohols [2]. An optimal catalyst for this reaction is a bifunctional catalyst, which combines active sites that favor C–C (chain growth) and C–O (termination step) bond forming reactions as well as hydrogenation sites. Several homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have already been studied in the literature for the synthesis of higher alcohols from CO/H2 and CO2/H2 mixtures. [3–10] Particularly interesting are modified catalysts for both low-temperature and high-temperature synthesis of methanol, since they show high alcohol productivity and selectivity [6,11–17]. The present study focuses on modified low-temperature methanol synthesis catalysts (Cu/ZnO/Al2O3) since those systems are well-known and have been thoroughly characterized and tested at industrial scale. Modified low-temperature methanol synthesis catalysts typically operate in a temperature and pressure range between 523 and 573 K and from 2.0 to 10.0 MPa, respectively, [6,18] at H2/CO ratios of 0.45–2.33 [6], preferably around 1:1 [19]. CO2 presence in the feed stream inhibits the synthesis of higher alcohols [4,6,19] and temperatures above 573 K need to be circumvented due to sintering of copper [6,18]. Methanol synthesis catalysts are known to be structure sensitive and they require a proper interaction between the Cu and ZnO crystallites to tune the reaction towards methanol. [20–22] Consequently, the preparation of the catalyst is decisive since control of the size and shape of the metal particles as well as of the interface is desirable [23,24]. An optimum amount of alkali promoter is used to enhance the selectivity towards ethanol and higher alcohols [4,6,25]. The promoting effect of alkali metals might be explained by the neutralization of acidic catalyst sites and the suppression of undesired side reactions, such as the formation of alkanes or other oxygenates. Generally, methanol and isobutanol are the main products for alkali-doped catalysts. [4,6,18,19] Several reaction mechanisms for modified methanol synthesis catalysts have been proposed in the literature as recently reviewed by Gupta et al. [6]. One of the most relevant mechanisms for Cs-doped CuO/ZnO is based on an aldol-type coupling which has been suggested by Nunan et al. [17,26] and extended by other authors [27–30]. Whereas linear chain growth is typically reported over Cu/ZnO catalysts, aldol-type coupling at the β-C-atom of ethanol is mostly observed over Cs-doped systems. The suggested reaction pattern on Cs-Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts, which also includes products derived from the homocoupling of ethanol, is presented in Scheme 1 . The C1 to C2 chain growth step has been regarded as the rate-limiting step on modified methanol synthesis catalysts. [31,32] Hence, ethanol was added to the synthesis gas in the present study to overcome the limiting reaction step and to propagate the chain growth from the C2 species. In previous publications [17,26,32–37], the addition of short-chain alcohols or intermediates to the synthesis gas was used to analyze the reaction paths and mechanisms in the higher alcohol synthesis and to guarantee the thermal control of the reaction. Feeding of CnH2n+1OH, usually enhanced the Cn+1H2n+3OH yield. A relevant approach is the utilization of double-bed reactors for the synthesis of higher alcohols since this proved the feasibility to produce higher alcohols from synthesis gas and ethanol (or other polyols) using alkali-modified high-temperature methanol catalysts. In the first bed, short-chain alcohols were produced, which grew further to branched alcohols in the subsequent bed. [11,38,39] In the present study, supported Cs-modified Cu/ZnO catalysts were used for the continuous production of higher alcohols from synthesis gas and ethanol. At first, Cs-modified Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts synthetized by different preparation methods were screened in a batch reactor to evaluate the influence on the product yields and selectivities during the synthesis of alcohols with the addition of ethanol in the feed. In a next step, the most promising catalyst was tested in a continuous-flow reactor and the reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, space velocity and ethanol to CO ratio were optimized. The use of ethanol as an additional substrate and the variation of the parameters further allowed to shed light into the reaction pathways proposed in literature."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalysts were prepared using wet impregnation, precipitation at constant pH and flame spray pyrolysis (denoted as wi, const_pH and fsp, respectively). For wet impregnation a solution of 4.3 g [Cu(NO3)2]·3H2O (Honeywell, purum p.a., 98–103 % (RT)) and 12.3 g [Zn(NO3)2]·6H2O (Honeywell, purum p.a., crystallized, ≥ 99%, (KT)) in 60 ml of distilled water was used. Subsequently, the precursor solution was added to 10.5 g of Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, catalysts support - high surface area, 1/8″ pellets), which was previously crushed, sieved (sieve fraction: 250–500 μm) and calcined in air at 773 K. The solution was heated to 313 K and stirred at 150 rpm for 1 h. Finally, the water was removed under low vacuum. The catalyst was dried over night at 353 K and then calcined in air at 623 K for 5 h. For a detailed preparation of the other two catalysts, cf. information in ESI, section 1. All catalysts (wi, const_pH and fsp) were doped with 1 mol% Cs relative to the Cu/ZnO content by using a subsequent wet impregnation step. The CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst together with the corresponding Cs precursor were diluted in 100 ml of ethanol. After evaporation of the solvent the catalyst was dried and calcined in the same way as the wi catalyst."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 Elemental analysis For the elemental analysis, the catalysts were digested in 5 ml of concentrated HNO3, 1 ml of concentrated HCl and 0.5 ml of H2O2 using a microwave reactor (Anton Paar, 600 W, 45 min) at a maximum temperature of 513 K and a maximum pressure of 6.0 MPa. The composition of the catalysts in the as-prepared state and after reaction was probed by inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) with an Agilent 725-ES instrument. Argon was used as carrier and plasma gas. The plasma was created by a 40 MHz high-frequency generator. The Cs content in the catalysts was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) using a VARIAN Zeeman SpectrAA 800. 2.2.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The calcined, reduced and used catalysts were analyzed by powder XRD on rotating sample holders with a PANalytical X´pert PRO diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (Ni filter, 40 mA, 45 kV). The diffraction patterns were recorded from 20 to 80° for 30 min (step size: 0.0170°, scan step time: 0.51 s). LaB6 was used as a standard to correct the instrumental line broadening. For phase analysis of the diffractograms, the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre was used. [40] 2.2.3 N2 physisorption The specific surface area of the calcined and used catalysts was obtained by N2 physisorption at 77 K (Belsorp mini II, Bell, Japan. Inc.). After evacuation of the catalysts at 573 K for 2 h, the specific surface area was determined using the multipoint BET theory in the p/p0 = 0.05- 0.3 range. The shape of the adsorption-desorption curve indicated a type II isotherm. 2.2.4 Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) Temperature programmed reduction in hydrogen was performed in a Micromeritics AutoChem HP 2950. The catalysts (100 mg) were reduced in a 10% H2/Ar stream (30 ml/min, standard temperature and pressure, STP) with a heating rate of 5 K/min from room temperature up to 873 K. A pretreatment was performed to remove adsorbed water by heating up until 423 K at 5 K/min under inert atmosphere. 2.2.5 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) TEM images were measured using an FEI Titan 80–300, 300 kV. An Au grid with a carbon film was used to mount the samples. The particle size distribution was acquired from the STEM images and the lattices spacing were obtained from HRTEM images."
4,Catalytic tests for higher alcohol synthesis,"2.3 Catalytic tests for higher alcohol synthesis 2.3.1 Batch reactor tests Catalytic screening experiments were performed in a 200 ml batch reactor stirred with a gas entrainment impeller (Inconel, costume-made at KIT) and equipped with a thermocouple inside the reactor, which was used to control the reaction temperature. A pressure sensor monitored the pressure as the reaction proceeded. The reactor was heated with a sand bath and cooled with an ice/water bath. The temperature and pressure data were continuously recorded during the complete reaction. Typical reaction conditions included a reaction time of 3 h, a temperature of 593 K, a H2 to CO ratio of 1:1, an initial synthesis gas pressure of 5.0 MPa, 1.66 g of catalyst and 30 g of liquid phase consisting of a mixture of cyclohexane/ethanol with a ratio of nEtOH : nCO = 0.5:1. 2.3.2 Continuous flow reactor tests The continuous synthesis of higher alcohols was performed for a selected catalyst in a home-built high pressure continuous-flow reactor. The reactor was packed with 1.5 g of [1.0 mol.% Cs-CuO/ZnO]/Al2O3 catalyst diluted 1:1 with an inert material (210 μm SiC, VWR Chemicals, technical). Up and downstream of the approximately 5 cm long catalyst bed the reactor was packed with 500 μm SiC (VWR Chemicals, technical). In a typical run, the catalyst was activated by reduction in 10% H2/N2 (500 ml/min) at atmospheric pressure while heating to 673 K at 10 K/min. The temperature was maintained at 673 K for 1 h. Before the reaction the synthesis gas mixture was adjusted on bypass to the desired composition using a micro gas chromatograph (μ-GC). The volumetric flows of the gases were verified using a Drycal gas flow calibrator. The pressure was slowly increased to reaction conditions (usually 8.0 MPa). After the reaction pressure was reached, the temperature was set to the desired value by heating with a rate of 10 K/min. Once the temperature was stable, the dosage of ethanol by a HPLC pump WADOSE-10-SS-U (Wagner Mess und Regeltechnik, 10 mln/min, maximum 40.0 MPa) was started. The liquid products were collected for 1 h in a cooled phase separator, sampled and analyzed offline with a gas chromatograph. The gaseous products were analyzed online using a micro GC. Details regarding the product analysis are given in the electronic supporting information (ESI, section 2)."
5,Results and discussion,This work focuses on 1.0 mol.% Cs-CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts synthesized by different preparation methods as a continuation of a study performed over unsupported doped-CuO/ZnO catalysts [25].
6,Overview on the fresh catalysts and basic characterization,"3.1 Overview on the fresh catalysts and basic characterization Cu/ZnO catalysts supported on Al2O3, activated carbon and SiO2 were prepared and screened in a batch reactor in pre-experiments for the synthesis of higher alcohols (not shown). As Al2O3 emerged as the most promising catalyst support, 1.0 mol.% Cs-CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation (wi), precipitation at constant pH (const_pH) and flame spray pyrolysis (fsp) and tested in the continuous synthesis of higher alcohol. At first, all catalysts were characterized in their as-prepared form. Table 1 shows the specific surface area and elemental composition (calculated and experimental elemental analysis by ICP-OES) of the different catalysts. In general, during preparation of the catalysts some pores of the support material were blocked by the addition of CuO/ZnO leading to losses in the surface area (cf. Table 1). The catalysts prepared by wet impregnation and precipitation at constant pH showed a similar decrease of the surface area. The FSP-derived catalyst exhibited the lowest specific surface area of 100 m2/g. The H2-TPR profiles of the various catalysts presented in Fig. 1 already provide evidence of the strong influence of the preparation method on the catalyst properties resulting in catalyst with different reduction profiles. Evidence of such behavior has already been found using X-ray absorption spectroscopy for Cu/ZnO catalysts prepared by coprecipitation at different ageing times and calcination temperatures. [41] The catalyst prepared by precipitation at constant pH exhibited two reduction peaks located at 465 K and 502 K, whereas the catalysts prepared by wet impregnation and flame spray pyrolysis both showed a single reduction peak located at 493 K and 509 K, respectively. The peak for the wi catalyst featured a shoulder in the lower temperature region. The presence of a shoulder or two reduction peaks in the reduction profile could be a consequence of either different particle sizes [42] or a sequential reduction Cu2+ → Cu1+ → Cu0 [43]. TEM images were recorded for the wi and const_pH catalysts evidencing a broader particle size distribution for the const_pH catalyst (see further ESI). The reduction process of the catalyst prepared by flame spray pyrolysis ended at lower temperatures compared to the other catalysts. The absence of peaks at higher temperatures discarded the formation of more crystalline phases or copper aluminates, which are more difficult to reduce [41]. The temperatures used for the activation of the catalyst (593 K and 673 K, for batch and continuous-flow reactions) were sufficient to ensure the complete reduction of the studied catalysts. Fig. 2 presents the XRD patterns of the three freshly calcined catalysts. In all cases, reflections for both CuO and ZnO were identified. The catalysts prepared by wet impregnation showed narrower and more intense reflections both for CuO and ZnO in comparison to catalysts prepared by fsp and const_pH, which indicated that the wi preparation method led to the formation of larger particles. The fsp catalyst showed less intense reflections for CuO and ZnO, whereas the reflections of γ-Al2O3 indicated a more crystalline alumina phase. The particle sizes for the reduced wi and conts_pH catalysts were determined by TEM. An average Cu particle size between 3 and 5 nm was found for both catalysts. Nonetheless, most particles of the wi catalyst had a size between 4 and 6 nm, whereas those of the const_pH catalyst showed a maximum between 3 and 4 nm in the histogram. Additionally, different phases were identified depending on the catalyst preparation method as evidenced by the images shown in the ESI."
7,Screening of the differently prepared Cs-doped catalysts in batch reactors,"3.2 Screening of the differently prepared Cs-doped catalysts in batch reactors After characterization of the catalysts in their as-prepared form, they were screened in a batch reactor similar as for the unsupported system [25]. For this purpose, optimized reaction conditions (nEtOH : nCO = 0.5:1, H2:CO = 1:1, 5.0 MPa and 593 K) were used. Here, only three selected 1.0 mol.% Cs-doped CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (30 wt.% Cu/ZnO on Al2O3) catalysts are reported (cf. Table 2 and Fig. 3 ). A significant influence of the preparation method both on conversion and yield was observed. The CO and ethanol conversions reached a maximum for the catalyst that was prepared by constant pH precipitation (69% and 96%, respectively). Among the catalysts, the lowest CO and ethanol conversions were observed for the wi catalyst (17% and 69%, respectively). The highest alcohol yield was obtained when the catalyst was prepared either by wet impregnation or flame spray pyrolysis (9.5–9.6%-C), whereas the const_pH catalyst yielded barely any alcohols (2.3%-C). The const_pH catalyst was more selective towards ethers (17.0%-C), the wi catalyst favored ethyl acetate (2.8%-C) and diethyl ether (3.2%-C) and the fsp catalyst yielded only 1.0%-C of other oxygenates. CO2 was produced with the highest yield by the catalyst prepared by precipitation at constant pH (11.6%-C), whereas for the other catalysts it reached yields between 6.0%-C and 8.0%-C. CO2 was probably formed via the water gas shift reaction. C2-4 alkanes were preferentially produced by the catalyst prepared by constant pH precipitation (3.9%-C). Significant differences in the selectivities towards the alcohol products were found depending on the preparation method, which would suggest distinct types of active sites on each catalyst (Fig. 3). The wi catalyst was most selective towards 1-butanol (17.0%-C), whereas the fsp catalyst was more selective to 1-propanol (2.2%-C), 2-butanol (3.7%-C.) and C5+ alcohols (4.6%-C). The catalyst prepared by constant pH precipitation was not particularly selective to any type of higher alcohol (2.8%-C total higher alcohol selectivity). As mentioned in the introduction, the reaction path during the alcohol synthesis could be identified by analyzing the product distribution. The main reaction path corresponded to an aldol-type coupling of oxygen-containing C1 and/or C2 intermediates with adsorbed alcohol derivatives and a minor reaction path that involved linear chain growth. 1-propanol was identified among the alcohol products in agreement with previous studies using unsupported and supported Cs-doped CuO/ZnO catalysts for the higher alcohol synthesis from synthesis gas [17,27,30]. Nevertheless, products derived from the homocoupling of ethanol were observed in major quantities instead of 2-methyl-1-propanol, the main termination product according to [17,27,30]. Two coupling routes have been identified for Cs-doped catalysts [17]: The first route involves the retention of the oxygen of the C1 intermediate (named aldol-type coupling with oxygen retention reversal β(R)) and the second route the retention of the oxygen of the adsorbed alcohol species (named normal aldol-type coupling β(N)). In reactions starting from synthesis gas, both routes would lead indistinctively to 1-propanol/2-methyl-1-propanol. However, the preferential production of 1-butanol or 2-butanol in the present study provided a clear indication of the followed reaction path. 2-Butanol would be produced if the β(R) couplings are preferred, whereas 1-butanol would be formed if the reaction occurs via β(N) couplings (cf. Scheme 1). Under the same reaction conditions, the catalyst prepared by wet impregnation favored the normal aldol-type coupling (β(N)), whereas the β(R) coupling was slightly more favored by the catalyst prepared by flame spray pyrolysis. In general, the main reaction paths were probably aldol-type couplings of C2 intermediates (probably acetaldehyde) with adsorbed ethanol species (probably ethoxide). To compare the supported catalyst system with an unsupported sample, Table 3 presents the space-time yield, turnover numbers (TON) and turnover frequencies (TOF) during the synthesis of higher alcohols in the batch reactor for the wi catalyst and an unsupported 1.0 mol% Cs/CuO/ZnO. In general, the TOF and TON were higher for the supported catalyst. This showed that the deposition of the active catalyst on the support led to a higher activity per copper site. The higher alcohol space-time yield for the unsupported catalyst corresponded to 62 gHA/(kgcat⋅h), which was lower in comparison to values presented by Nunan et al. [17]. Using different reaction conditions, these authors reported a higher alcohol space-time yield of 144 gHA/(kgcat⋅h) for 0.34 mol.% Cs-doped Cu/ZnO catalyst. In the case of the supported catalyst, the STY for the present catalyst corresponded to 51 gHA/(kgcat⋅h). In comparison to literature reports [44], which gave 15 gHA/(kgcat⋅h) for a 0.3 mol.% Cs-doped Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, the STY used in the present study was higher. Note that the space-time yield considers the mass of the catalyst and is often reported in literature. Even though the comparison in terms of TOF or TON is better suited for evaluating the catalytic activity (cf. Table 3, entries 2 and 3), these values were not reported in the above-mentioned studies. In summary, compared to previous studies [17,27,30] the presence of ethanol as a reactant allowed additionally the aldol-type coupling of C2 intermediates with adsorbed alcohol species, which led to the formation of 1-butanol (β(N)) or 2-butanol (β(R)). Different active sites were formed depending on the preparation method, which led to variations in the alcohol distribution. For supported Cs-doped catalysts prepared by wet impregnation, the coupling of C2 intermediates with adsorbed ethanol-like species was preferred leading to an increase in the 1-butanol production."
8,Catalytic tests in a continuous flow reactor,"3.3 Catalytic tests in a continuous flow reactor 1 mol.% Cs-CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 prepared by wet impregnation was chosen for further catalytic tests in a high pressure, downward continuous-flow reactor, since it showed the highest yield and selectivity to higher alcohols during the screening in batch reactors. The space time yield, the temperature and the ethanol to CO ratio were varied and their effect on the CO and ethanol conversions, product yields and selectivities in the higher alcohols synthesis were evaluated (Table 4 ). 3.3.1 Effect of the space velocity Table 4 and Fig. 4 present the effect of the space velocity on the yields and selectivities for the synthesis of higher alcohols. For this study, three different space velocities were considered: 7, 400, 15,100 and 19,400 L(STP)/(kgcat⋅h). The selectivities and yields of each particular product can be found in the Electronic Supporting Information (ESI, Table S2). CO conversion increased from 6 to 15% with increasing space velocity from 7,400 (STP)/(kgcat⋅h) to 19,400 (STP)/(kgcat⋅h), going through a minimum at 15,100 (STP)/(kgcat⋅h). Lower space velocities may have led to a coverage of the surface with intermediates of slow β(N) couplings, like those for 1-butanol production, which hampered the CO conversion. Ethanol conversion showed a minimum at medium space velocities (32%). The yields of higher alcohols and other oxygenates increased with space velocity. At the highest space velocity, the yields to methanol, higher alcohols and other oxygenates corresponded to 1.7, 5.6 and 4.6%-C, respectively. Methanol selectivity increased from 1.0 to 4.8%-C when the space velocity was increased from 15,100 to 19,400 L(STP)/(kgcat⋅h), which could be related to the higher CO conversion, since methanol is suggested to be formed directly from synthesis gas. Higher space velocities also favored higher selectivity towards higher alcohols (16.2%-C). The CO2 selectivity increased considerably with the space velocity reaching a maximum of 17.9%-C, which suggested that the water gas shift reaction occurred fast. Additionally, higher selectivity towards alkanes were observed at higher space velocities reaching up to 8.0%-C, whereas a medium space velocity led to higher selectivity towards other oxygenates. Since higher alcohol synthesis proceeds via a chain growth reaction, longer residence times (i.e. lower space velocities) should favor their production. However, this was not the case for the analyzed space velocities. The selectivity to different alcohols and further selected products is presented in more detail in Fig. 4 (a) and (b), respectively. Fig. 4 (a) shows that all product selectivities, except those for ethers and esters, increased with space velocity. Most probably, a common intermediate existed for the liquid products. At low space velocities, the product with the highest selectivity corresponded to CO2 (11.0%-C). Alcohols and esters were produced with similar selectivities (4.7%-C and 4.4%-C, respectively). Among the alcohols (Fig. 4 (b)), the highest selectivity was to 1-butanol (3.1%-C), followed by methanol (1.0%-C) and traces of 2-propanol and 2-butanol, which proved that only C2 intermediates reacted in the coupling reaction. At medium space velocities, the selectivities to all reaction products increased (Fig. 4 (a)). Also, esters and ethers reached a maximum in their selectivities for the applied reaction conditions (16.7%-C and 2.7 %-C, respectively). Among the alcohols, the product with the highest selectivity corresponded to 1-butanol (11.8%-C). Additionally, an increase in the selectivities to 2-propanol, 1-propanol and 2-butanol was observed compared to the selectivities found at 7,400 L(STP)/ (kgcat⋅h). At a space velocity of 19,400 L(STP)/ (kgcat⋅h), alcohols, ketones/aldehydes and CO2 reached a maximum in their selectivities (21.0%-C, 10.4%-C and 17.9%-C, respectively). The alcohol distribution at this space velocity suggested that both aldol-type couplings of C1 and C2 intermediates took place. 1-Propanol (1.3%-C) and 2-methyl-1-propanol (0.1%-C) evidenced the coupling of C1 intermediates as suggested by Nunan et al. [17], while the formation of 2-propanol (1.3%-C and 2-butanol/1-butanol (˜13%-C each) confirmed the coupling of C2 intermediates. The selectivity to C5+ alcohols was also enhanced at higher space velocities reaching ˜13%-C. In summary, regardless of the applied space velocity, aldol-type coupling reactions involving C2 intermediates occurred. On the contrary, only at middle and high space velocities evidence for aldol-type coupling reactions involving C1 intermediates was found. Nonetheless, the applied space velocity had an influence on the termination product obtained from C2 coupling reactions. Low and middle space velocities favored the path β(N) leading mainly to 1-butanol, whereas high space velocities favored both paths β(N) and β(R) leading to 1-butanol, 2-butanol and 2-propanol. The increasing selectivities of the products from coupling reactions involving C1 intermediates that were observed at high space velocities gave further evidence for the participation of the path β(R). Particularly, the production of 1-butanol and esters (ethyl acetate) were enhanced under the same conditions, which suggests a common intermediate. The preference of 1-butanol and esters at medium space velocities suggested a slower reaction rate compared to the formation of other reaction products. Therefore, a space velocity of 19,400 L(STP)/ (kgcat⋅h) was selected for further tests. 3.3.2 Influence of the reaction temperature Table 4 and Fig. 5 present the influence of the reaction temperature in the higher alcohol synthesis. Further details on all detected and identified products can be found in the ESI (Table S3). Increase of the reaction temperature from 543 K to 643 K led to an increased yield of all reaction products (Table 4), except for other oxygenates, which remained at around 13%-C and 5%-C (apart from 543 K), respectively. The slight increase in the methanol yield suggested that methanol further reacted to branched alcohols with a methyl side chain or other products when the temperature increased from 543 K to 593 K (ESI, Table S2 and S3). Most probably, methanol synthesis was close to its equilibrium at 643 K, since a lower methanol yield was observed at this temperature in comparison to 593 K, a tendency that could be expected if equilibrium had been reached [45]. The formation of branched alcohols with a methyl side chain evidenced a path involving the coupling of C1 intermediates. Although the ethanol conversion was higher (11.2%) upon temperature increase from 593 K to 643 K, only a slight increase in the total yield of liquid products from 11.9%-C to 12.6%-C was observed. This suggests that ethanol reacted further to C2-4 alkanes or other side products, as the yields to these compounds increased. The CO2 yield increased with temperature (from 0.4%-C to 6.2%-C and to 7.7%-C, respectively). The higher CO2 content may be at the origin of thermodynamics, i.e. by approaching the equilibrium of the water gas shift reaction. Fig. 5 presents the influence of the reaction temperature on the selectivity of selected products and alcohols, respectively. Note that some of the reactions in this system are not only kinetically favored but also reach their thermodynamic equilibrium and this could influence the observed product distributions and, consequently, the extent of chain growth. [26,45] For example, the hydrogenation reaction of the pair 2-butanol/2-butanone most probably reached its equilibrium, since their yields decreased with increasing temperature as expected from data presented in [45]. On the contrary, the reaction involving the pair 1-butanol/1-butanal most probably did not reach its equilibrium at the present reaction conditions, because their yields increased with temperature. Similar behavior can be expected for other alcohol/ketone and alcohol/aldehyde pairs, particularly those involving longer C chains due to a flattening of the equilibrium curve with chain growth (Fig. 2 in [45]). The highest selectivity at a low reaction temperature (543 K) was found for esters (6.9%-C) followed by CO2 (4.0%-C, cf. Fig. 5 (a)). At this temperature, similar selectivities to alcohols and ketones/aldehydes were observed (2.4%-C). Among the alcohols, only evidence of coupling reactions involving C2 intermediates were found. 1-Butanol was formed with the highest selectivity following the path β(N). Intermediate temperatures (593 K) resulted in a maximum of the selectivity towards ketones and aldehydes (10.4%-C), which indicated that these compounds were intermediates in the formation of alcohols and esters. The selectivity to alcohols increased to 21.0%-C, whereas the selectivity to esters decreased to 2.7 %-C. At this temperature an evidence of coupling reactions involving C1 intermediates was also found, since 1-propanol and 2-methyl-1-propanol were identified among the products, probably due to a higher abundance of methanol species on the surface. At 593 K, the 2-butanol formation reached a maximum that, in addition with the production of 1-propanol and 2-methyl-1-propanol, suggested an aldol-type coupling β(R) under these conditions. At higher temperatures (643 K), the selectivity to CO2 and ethers increased up to 20.7%-C and 3.3%-C, respectively, whereas the selectivities to alcohols and esters maintained at the same level as for 593 K. On the contrary, the selectivity to ketones/aldehydes decreased to 6.1%-C. A higher temperature (643 K) resulted in higher selectivities to 1-butanol among the alcohols (13.0%-C). This indicates that an increasing temperature favored the normal aldol-type coupling β(N) and hindered the formation of products via aldol-type coupling β(R). A slight increase in the yield of C5+ alcohols was observed at higher temperatures, but lower than the one for 1-butanol. The most notable difference in the product selectivities was observed when the temperature was increased from 543 K to 593 K. Hence, a minimum temperature seems to be required for the synthesis of higher alcohols as otherwise byproducts are preferred. Nonetheless, too high temperatures must be avoided, since they could lead to sintering of the copper particles and catalyst deactivation. Therefore, despite of a higher selectivity to 1-butanol at 643 K, 593 K was chosen as the reaction temperature for further tests since increasing the temperature did not affect the total alcohols selectivity in such a high extent. 3.3.3 Influence of the ethanol to CO ratio in the higher alcohols synthesis In our previous study using a batch reactor system [25], a remarkable influence of the ethanol to CO ratio was found for the higher alcohol synthesis over CuO/ZnO catalysts. Hence, four different ethanol to CO ratios were studied in continuous flow. Table 4 and Fig. 6 present the effect of changes in the ethanol to CO ratio on the selectivity towards higher alcohols. Further details regarding the product yields and selectivities can be found in Table S4 (ESI). A maximum yield and selectivity of higher alcohols was found for a nEtOH : nCO ratio of 0.3:1(5.6%-C and 16.2%-C, respectively). Methanol and branched alcohols with a methyl side chain synthesis also showed a maximum at the same nEtOH : nCO ratio of 0.3:1, which suggests that both higher alcohols and methanol formation proceed via similar intermediates. Lower ratios enhanced mostly the yields and selectivities towards gaseous products such as alkanes (1.5%-C and 21.4%-C, respectively) and CO2 (1.7%-C and 24.0%-C, respectively). Increasing the nEtOH : nCO ratio from 0.3:1 to 0.9:1 led to an abrupt increase in yield (from 4.6%-C to 13.1%-C) and selectivity (from 13.5%-C to 42.3%-C) to other oxygenates, partly at the expense of alcohol synthesis. Similar results were observed during the batch screening [25], where an increase from 0.5:1 to 0.9:1 in the nEtOH : nCO resulted in a significant increase in the formation of other oxygenates. Additionally, a maximum in the conversion of CO and ethanol was observed (15.2%-C and 66.6%-C, respectively) for the optimum nEtOH : nCO ratio of 0.3:1. At higher ratios, the CO conversion decreased marginally (0.01%-C), whereas the ethanol conversion did not show any clear tendency. Fig. 6 (a) and (b) show the effect of the ethanol to CO ratio on the various products and alcohol selectivities. At an nEtOH : nCO ratio of 0.05:1, CO2 was identified as the product with the highest selectivity (24.0%-C), whereas only small amounts of ketones/aldehydes (0.9%-C) and alcohols (1.7%-C) were formed. Among the alcohols, only methanol and 2-propanol could be detected. At a nEtOH : nCO ratio of 0.3:1, the selectivity towards CO2 decreased to 17.9%-C, whereas the selectivity to all other products increased. Alcohols, ketones/aldehydes, esters and ethers reached selectivities of 21.0%-C, 10.4%-C, 2.7 %-C and 0.3%-C, respectively. Particularly, the selectivity to alcohols reached its maximum for all reaction conditions studied. At this ratio, the preferred alcohol products were methanol, 2-butanol, 1-butanol and C5+ alcohols, which were all formed with very similar selectivities (˜ 4.5%-C). Also 2-propanol, 1-propanol (both 1.3%-C), 2-methyl-1-propanol (0.1%-C) and other branched alcohols with a methyl side chain (0.9%-C) were identified, but with lower selectivity. This alcohol distribution suggested that aldol-type coupling reactions of both oxygen containing C1 and C2 intermediates occurred simultaneously. 1-Propanol and 2-methyl-1-propanol were formed via aldol-type coupling of C1 intermediates with ethanol and 1-propanol, respectively, as suggested by Nunan et al. [17]. 1-Butanol and 2-butanol were formed from homocoupling of two ethanol molecules. A further increase in the ratio to nEtOH : nCO ratio of 0.9:1 shifted the selectivity to esters and ethers at the expense of alcohols and CO2. Both the selectivities towards esters and ethers increased to 31.4%-C and 0.7%-C, respectively, whereas the selectivity to ketones and aldehydes was maintained approximately at the same level (10.4%-C to 12.4%-C). The alcohol selectivity showed a slight decrease to 17.6%-C. Also, differences in the alcohol distribution were observed when the ratio was increased as can be seen in Fig. 6 (b). Particularly, the coupling of C1 intermediates was most affected, since the selectivity to 1-propanol decreased from 1.3%-C to 0.2%-C for example. The coupling of C2 intermediates was the main reaction path leading to 2-propanol, 2-butanol and 1-butanol. Among the products derived from C2 coupling reactions, the highest selectivity was obtained for 1-butanol (8.1%-C). An increase of the ethanol to CO ratio to nEtOH : nCO of 2.0:1 led to a further increase in the selectivity to esters and ethers reaching 36.5%-C and 0.9%-C, respectively. This suggested that esters and ethers were produced from reactions of C2 species. For this ratio, also the selectivity to ketones and aldehydes maintained at the same level as for nEtOH : nCO ratios of 0.3:1 and 0.9:1. On the contrary, the selectivity to alcohols and CO2 decreased to 11.9%-C and 5.4%-C, respectively. Among the alcohols, the alcohol product with the highest selectivity corresponded to 1-butanol (Fig. 6 (b)). For this ratio, C2 aldol-type coupling reactions were also hampered, since the selectivities to both 2-propanol and 2-butanol decreased to 1.5%-C each. 3.3.4 Catalyst performance and stability To evaluate the catalyst stability in the continuous reaction, it was characterized by XRD after the reaction (ESI, Figure S1). The used catalyst was removed from the reactor, sieved to separate it from the SiC particles and then analyzed by XRD (ESI, Figure S1). Note that the catalyst was exposed to air during this procedure. Additionally, its composition was determined by elemental analysis and its specific surface was obtained area by N2 physisorption. After the reaction, Cu (reflection at 43.2°) and ZnO (reflection at 56.6°) were identified at the same position as for the reduced catalyst. After the reaction, the catalyst featured a specific surface area of 140 m2/g, which was slightly lower than for the freshly prepared catalyst (160 m2/g, Table 1). The elemental composition of the catalyst after reaction evidenced some leaching of the active metals. The Cu and Zn contents decreased from 6.6 wt.% to 5.7 wt.% and from 19.2 wt.% to 18.1 wt.%, respectively. Table 5 presents STYHA, TON and TOF in the higher alcohol synthesis for [1.0 mol.% Cs-CuO/ZnO]/Al2O3 catalyst using the continuous-flow reactor. The addition of ethanol (nEtOH : nCO ratio of 0.05:1 compared to 0.3:1) and the use of a continuous-flow reactor improved the catalytic activity considerably. Particularly, the activity of the catalyst per active site (TOF) improved by one order of magnitude. This suggested that the operation in a continuous-flow reactor is recommended for the synthesis of higher alcohols. Table 5 presents a comparison with literature data for different catalysts used in the synthesis of higher alcohols. The catalyst prepared in this study showed a relatively low catalytic performance compared to catalysts published in literature using low ethanol concentrations in the feed (nEtOH : nCO of 0.05). Nevertheless, when the feed concentration of ethanol was increased to a nEtOH : nCO ratio of 0.3:1 (Table 5), the performance of the catalyst improved considerably. Particularly, the TOF increased by two orders of magnitude."
9,Mechanistic considerations,"3.4 Mechanistic considerations Scheme 2 shows the possible reaction pathways for the synthesis of higher alcohols and esters under the applied reaction conditions. It was drawn based on the observed product distribution and considering previous publications of Gines and Iglesia [48] and Nunan et al. [17]. All higher alcohols that were detected at the optimum nEtOH : nCO ratio of 0.3:1 can be derived from the reactions presented in Scheme 2. According to the proposed mechanism, copper sites could act as hydrogenation/dehydrogenation sites under the applied reaction conditions. Methanol was formed directly from CO/CO2 and H2. 1-Propanol (path I) and 2-methyl-1-propanol (path II) were formed via aldol-type coupling of oxygen-containing C1 intermediates derived from methanol as suggested by Nunan et al. [17]. Dehydrogenation of ethanol led to acetaldehyde, which can undergo homocoupling to form 3-hydroxy-butanal (aldol) and further react to 1-butanol (path III). 1-Butanol can also be produced via linear addition of C1 intermediates to 1-propanol (path IV). Alternatively, 3-hydroxy-butanal can isomerize to 1-hydroxy-3-butanone (keto) via an intramolecular hydrogen transfer (path V), which led to 2-butanol as the final product (path VI, aldol coupling with oxygen retention reversal). The amount of available ethanol influenced the product distribution (Fig. 6). Low ethanol contents favored the equilibrium towards 1-hydroxy-3-butanone, which further reacted to form 2-propanol and 2-butanol as the termination products. Additionally, lower ratios favored coupling reactions which involved C1 intermediates leading to 1-propanol and branched alcohols with a methyl side chain as products. When the ethanol content was increased, the internal hydrogen transfer required for the isomerization to 1-hydroxy-3-butanone was hampered shifting the equilibrium towards 3-hydroxy-butanal, which led mainly to 1-butanol (path III in Scheme 2). The basicity of the catalyst surface played a significant role for the preferred reaction path. Nunan et al. [17] proposed that a more basic catalyst surface (as a consequence of Cs doping) would enhance the production of 1-propanol (and also 2-butanol, as observed in the present work) through a faster route (β(R)). In the absence of Cs, 1-propanol (and for the present study also 1-butanol) would be preferentially formed by a slower aldol-type coupling (β(N)) and linear chain growth with formyl species. CO contributed also to changes in the surface basicity by production of CO2 via reactions with lattice oxygen consequently creating oxygen vacancies, which enhanced aldol-type coupling reactions instead of esterification. [49] Most probably, a higher ethanol to CO ratio hindered the oxidation of CO to CO2 by blocking the adsorption sites and causing (i) an increase in the ester production (ethyl acetate) and (ii) hampering of the faster β(R) route (decrease in 1-propanol and 2-butanol production). Additionally, the results presented in Fig. 6 (a) suggested that ketones and aldehydes were intermediates in the formation of both esters and alcohols via the Tischenko/Cannizzaro reaction. Ethanol-derived adsorbates on the catalyst surface might have partially occupied the copper hydrogenation sites, which allowed the further hydrogenation of the aldehydes and ketones to alcohols instead of favoring esterification reactions. For the catalyst system used in the present study, the most abundant ester corresponded to ethyl acetate (path VII)."
10,Conclusions,"In the present work, the synthesis of higher alcohols from synthesis gas and ethanol was studied using a batch reactor for catalyst screening and a continuous flow setup for parameter screening. The most appropriate preparation method for the 1.0 mol% Cs-CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst was evaluated by performing catalytic screening in the batch reactor. Afterwards, the best catalyst was used for unravelling the influence of space velocity, CO/ethanol ratio and reaction temperature on both the space-time yield and the selectivity towards higher alcohols. Changes in the preparation method resulted in catalysts with different active sites, which led to distinct hydrogen reduction profiles as well as differences in the catalytic activities and product distributions. The best overall performance was achieved with the 1.0 mol% Cs-CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst prepared via wet impregnation. During batch operation the formation of 1-butanol was preferred, which corresponded to an aldol-type homocoupling of ethanol (reaction path β (N)). During continuous operation, space velocity, temperature and ethanol to CO ratio had a strong influence on the performance. The highest yield and selectivity to higher alcohols were achieved when using an ethanol to CO ratio of 0.3:1 (aldol-type coupling favored β(N)), a space velocity of 19,400 L(STP)/(kgcat⋅h) and a temperature of 593 K. Furthermore, the product distribution could be tuned by specifically changing these reaction parameters: A high ethanol to CO ratio (nEtOH : nCO > 0.3:1) hindered the β(R) path and favored the β(N) path which led to an increased formation of esters. The highest selectivity to esters was observed for a nEtOH : nCO ratio of 2.0:1. By increasing the space velocity, a shift from mainly aldol-type coupling at the β-C-atom of ethanol (β(N)) to a mixture of both reaction pathways β(N) and β(R) occurred, whereas the formation of esters and 1-butanol was favored at medium space velocities. By increasing the reaction temperature, the formation of 1-butanol was preferred, accompanied by a higher formation of undesired gaseous byproducts, probably due to thermodynamic reasons. In conclusion, the addition of ethanol to overcome the rate-limiting step is not only interesting for the identification of the mechanistic pathways but also a promising first approach for the continuous production of higher alcohols. Further improvements are still required. In this respect, the present study shows that both the catalyst and the reaction conditions have a strong influence on the performance and can be exploited further by optimization."
