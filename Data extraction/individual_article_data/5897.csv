0,Introduction,"Recently, green approach for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) from graphene oxide (GO) has received significant attention, to get enhanced electrical, physical and chemical properties. In fact, rGO has high electrical conductivity [1], high surface area and transparency [2]. Due to these properties, it shows great potential in various application, such as sensors [3–5], photovoltaic cell [6,7], super-capacitors [8], energy storage [9,10], coatings of transparent conductive layers [11], drug delivery [12,13], and bio sensing [14–16], The GO has sp2 carbon components and sp3 epoxy or hydroxyl groups [17] and it can be converted to rGO/graphene by removing sp3 epoxy or hydroxyl group. GO is mainly synthesized chemically by using Hummer's method and Brodie's method [18,19]. The modified and improved versions of the above mentioned two methods are used for a faster and large amount of synthesis of GO. The reduction of oxide groups in GO is made by using sonication technique [20], thermal reduction [21,22], and chemical methods [23]. The first two methods require more time and uncertain in the reduction of the oxygen group in GO. The chemical reduction method is faster, efficient and controllable. So, the chemical reduction is suitable for the synthesis of rGO with less defects. But, bulk production of rGO requires an easy, faster and green approach to promote their application in energy storage, medical and opto-electronics. Generally, hydrazine hydrate [24,25] Ammonia [26], Hydrogen Sulfide [27], and sodium borohydride [28,29] are used for the reduction process of graphene oxide, but the reduction of GO by these chemicals generate toxic and hazardous materials. Many researchers are continuously endeavored towards the development of eco-friendly reducing agents for GO reduction. In this direction, some natural materials/chemicals are promising substitutes for toxic reducing agents such as iron [30–32], zinc [33], aluminum [34], potassium hydroxide [35], aloe vera [36], organic chemicals [37–42], vitamin C [43], caffeine [44] and ascorbic acid [45]. Silva et. al. [41]. used ethanol assisted thermal reduction of graphene oxide in CVD system, but this technique is expensive and required high temperature. Gong et al. [42] used methanol and ethanol during the annealing process for the reduction of GO, but this process required comparatively longer time. So, more research is required to find an economically viable and fast process of chemical reduction of GO without harming the environment to achieve enhanced electrical and chemical properties. Here we have adopted a modified Hummers' method with varying and optimizing process parameters for fast synthesis of GO. Our green approach of chemical reduction uses different alcohols as reducing agents for the synthesis of rGO from GO. The effects of alcohol on Raman spectra, absorption spectra, FTIR spectra, optical band gap and electrical conductivity have been studied for qualitative analysis."
1,Method and materials,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals The Graphite flake, Sulfuric acid (98%), Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Permanganate, Hydrochloric acid, Acetone, ethanol, 2-propanol, methanol were purchased from Merck and Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were analytical grade."
3,Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide,"2.2 Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide Graphene oxide was prepared from graphite flakes using modified Hummer's method with the change of process parameters [18]. The synthesis of GO involves both oxidation and exfoliation of graphite sheets due to the thermal treatment of the solution. Here, 2 gm of Graphite flakes and 1 gm of NaNO3 were mixed in 50 ml of H2SO4 in an ice bath under continuous stirring for 2 h. Then 6 gm of KMnO4 was added to the solution very slowly maintaining the temperature below 15 °C and stirred continuously for 4 h under ice bath and after that, 200 ml of DI water was added to the solution and stirred for another 2 h. After removing the ice bath the solution was stirred for another 2 h. The mixture was kept in a reflux system at 95 °C for 15 min for making a brown color solution. Thereafter the temperature was maintained below 30 °C and the solution was continuously stirred for 2 h. The solution was treated with 15 ml of H2O2 to obtain a yellowish color. After adding 200 ml of DI water, the resulting solution was stirred for 2 h and was kept at a steady condition for 4 h. It was then filtered and was repeatedly centrifuged using 10% HCl and DI water. Finally, the mixture was dried at 60 °C for 24 h to get the graphene oxide sample. Fig- 1(a) shows schematic of oxidation mechanism for the synthesis of GO sample from graphite flake. The prepared sample was characterized by using FTIR, Raman spectroscopy and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy. The prominent D, G and a weak 2D peak of Raman spectra of the sample at 1364 cm−1, 1605 cm−1 and 2683 cm−1 respectively confirm the formation of GO in the sample (Supplementary Fig. 1S). FTIR spectra of GO sample shows O–H stretching peak at 3400 cm−1 which is more than that of graphite flake sample. The peak of CO stretching at 1717 cm−1, C–O stretching peak at 1385 cm−1, C–O epoxy stretching at 1385 cm−1 and C–O–C stretching at 1053 cm−1 indicates more oxygen presence in GO sample, whereas there is no presence of CO and C–O stretching in the graphite sample (Supplementary Fig. 2S). The EDX analysis of GO sample also shows an increase of oxygen content to 45.29% (by weight) in GO from 10% of oxygen content in graphite sample (Supplementary Fig. 3S). The above analysis confirms the successful synthesis of GO from the graphite flake."
4,Synthesis of reduced graphene oxide,"2.3 Synthesis of reduced graphene oxide In the case of synthesis of ethanol reduced graphene oxide (E-rGO), 100 mg of prepared graphene oxide was added to 100 ml of ethanol. The solution was heated in a reflux system for 8 h under continuous stirring at 1000 rpm. The solutions were allowed to cool at ambient temperature and centrifuged to make it paste form. The resulting paste was dried at 60 °C to obtain E-rGO. Fig- 1(b) shows a schematic illustration of the synthesis of E-rGO having very less number of OH groups (as confirmed in FTIR spectra later in the paper). For the synthesis of rGO using methanol, the solution of GO sample and methanol was heated in a reflux system for 8 h under continuous stirring at 1000 rpm. Then the solution was cooled at the temperature of 25 °C for 1 h and centrifuged to get its paste form. The paste form sample was dried at 60 °C to get methanol reduced GO (M-rGO). Fig. 1 (c) represents the schematic illustration of the reduction of GO to get M-rGO. We have made rGO from a solution of GO and 2-propanol solution. The solution was heated in a reflux system under stirring at 1000 rpm. The solution was cooled and centrifuged at ambient temperature. Then the sample was dried at 60 °C to get propanol reduced GO(P-rGO). Fig. 1(d) shows the schematic representation of the reduction of GO to get P-rGO. Similarly, acetone reduced GO (A-rGO) was made with a similar procedure of methanol for comparison of rGO made with the above alcohols. Fig. 1(e) shows the schematic representation of the reduction reaction of GO to obtain A-rGO. The byproducts with chemical reduction of oxygen with the above chemical agents are mainly organic compound and water showing no toxic effects in the environment. Moreover, the above technique for the synthesis of rGO is 15 times faster than work reported by Dreyer et. al. [37], 1.5 times faster than work reported by He et. al. [38]. and 12 times faster than Gong et. al. [42]."
5,Result and discussion,"The synthesized reduced graphene oxides were characterized and analyzed by using different FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, U–V spectroscopy and I–V measurement."
6,X-ray powder diffraction (XRD),"3.1 X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) X-ray diffraction of the GO and rGO samples was performed to determine the crystallite size and interlayer spacing by using XRD, RIGAKU-MINIFLUX, Cu-Kɑ radiation (λ = 1.540598 Å) with 30 kV, 15 mA at a scan rate of 1ᴼ/min. Fig. 2 (a) and (b) shows the XRD pattern of GO and graphite powder. The result shows that graphite had a strong and sharp peak at 2θ = 26° along <002> orientation [46], indicating the layered structure of graphite with d-spacing of 0.34 nm (determined by Bragg's equation as shown in Table-1). After the oxidation of graphite flake into GO, <002> peak was shifted to 10.65° (GO) with d spacing of 0.83 nm. The increase in d spacing is attributed to the intercalated oxygen functional groups present in the layered structure. The crystalline size of graphene oxide was determined by using Scherrer's equation as D = 4.3 nm which was lower than that of the graphite sample as shown in Table-1. Fig. 2(c), (d), (e) and (f) shows the XRD pattern of A-rGO, P-rGO, M-rGO and E-rGO with <002> peaks at 25.89°, 24.80°, 24.29° and 24.40° with d-spacing of 0.34 nm, 0.35 nm, 0.36 nm and 0.36 nm respectively. The lower value of d spacing in rGO than that of GO indicates the removal of oxygen functional groups in rGO. Table 1 also shows the crystalline size of A-rGO, E-rGO, P-rGO and M-rGO. The crystalline size of E-rGO is 17.54 Ao which is lower than that of other rGOs."
7,Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,"3.2 Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR spectra of GO and different rGO samples were obtained by using Nicolet Impact 410 FTIR spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 3 . The figure shows the oxygen-containing functional groups of GO before and after the reduction using acetone, methanol, 2-propanol and ethanol. The strong absorption peak at 3400 cm−1 of GO sample indicates more OH stretching in comparison to that of other rGO and lower absorption in E-rGO shows less OH stretching than that of other rGOs (as shown in Fig- 1b). Very weak peaks at 1717 cm−1, 1385 cm−1 and 1190 cm−1 indicate the presence of less amount of carboxyl, carbonyl and epoxy groups in rGO samples (especially in E-rGO) than that in GO. The above results confirm that many oxygen-containing functional groups were successively removed in rGO samples."
8,Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy,"3.3 Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy EDX spectra of graphite, GO, A-rGO, M-rGO, P-rGO and E-rGO samples were performed to investigate oxygen and carbon content samples (Fig- 3S supplementary). From EDX analysis, carbon and oxygen in the atomic level were obtained as shown in Table-2 . Table shows C/O ratio of 1.61 in GO sample indicating the presence of more oxygen than rGO samples. High C/O ratio of 2.72 obtained in E-rGO sample in comparison to other rGO samples confirms more oxygen reduction by using ethanol than other alcoholic mediums."
9,Raman spectroscopy,"3.4 Raman spectroscopy Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the characterization of carbon materials. Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of rGO. The value of D and G peaks of A-rGO, M-rGO, P-rGO and E-rGO were obtained at 1351 cm−1 and 1587 cm−1. The 2D peak was obtained in A rGO (Fig. 4(a)) and M-rGO (Fig. 4(b)) samples indicating the presence of defects in those samples. The ID/IG ratio was estimated as 1.15, 1.22, 1.26, 1.31 for A-rGO, M-rGO, P-rGO and E-rGO from Fig. 4(a), (b), (c) and (d) respectively, whereas ID/IG ratio for GO was determined as 0.99 (supplementary Fig- 1S). The increase of ID/IG ratio in E-rGO samples shows the presence of more defects in comparison to other rGO samples."
10,Scanning electron microscope analysis,"3.5 Scanning electron microscope analysis The morphology of the GO and rGO samples were investigated using SEM image. Fig. 5 (a) shows the SEM image of typical graphite flakes. The SEM image in Fig- 5b indicates the layered structure of Graphene oxide confirming exfoliation of graphene sheets. The SEM images of A-rGO, M-rGO, P-rGO and E-rGO samples in Fig- 5(c), (d), (e) and (f) respectively show a similar type of exfoliated sheets as mentioned in case of GO."
11,Optical characterization of graphene and reduced graphene oxide,"3.6 Optical characterization of graphene and reduced graphene oxide UV–Vis spectroscopy was performed at room temperature using Thermo Scientific UV-10 Spectrometer to study the optical properties of prepared GO and rGO. The UV-VIS absorbance spectra of GO sample in Fig-6 shows absorbance peak at an approximate wavelength of 228 nm whereas the absorbance peak of rGO samples were found around wavelength 248–254 nm. The optical band gap of A-rGO. M-rGO, P-rGO and E-rGO were estimated using Tauc's plot [supplementary figure 4(s)] as mentioned in Table-2. Our result of GO determines band gap of 4.12 eV, matching well with the previously reported work [46,47]. The band gap of rGO samples was tuned to 3.625eV, 3.55eV, 3.50eV, and 3.13eV by reduction of oxide groups made by using acetone, methanol, 2-propanol and ethanol respectively. The lower value of Bandgap in E-rGO sample promises the generation of charge carrier with lower photon energies in comparison to other samples."
12,Electrical characterization,"3.7 Electrical characterization The I–V characteristics for different rGO films with IDE electrodes were carried out using Keithley 2100 multimeter and Agilent 3631 A voltage source unit at room temperature. Fig. 7 shows the I–V characteristics of different rGO samples with applied bias voltage ranging from 0 to +5 V. The I–V curve of all samples shows similar behavior. E-rGO shows higher current than that of other samples whereas A-rGO shows lower current than the other samples. The conductivity of E-rGO is highest (1.191 Sm-1)at room temperature compared with other samples (Table 3 ). The reason for the increase in the conductivity of E-rGO may be attributed to more reduction of oxygen groups than using other reducing agents. This was already proved by FTIR, Raman and EDX spectra analysis. Fig-7(c) shows the conductivity vs Temperature curve of E-rGO. It was observed that the conductivity increased with increase in temperature. The I–V characteristic for prepared E-rGO thin films was observed both in dark condition and under 360 nm UV illumination with intensity 100 μW/cm2. Fig. 8 shows the dark and UV-illuminated currents. A maximum photocurrent of 12.3 μAmp was obtained at 5 V bias voltage."
13,Conclusion,"In this work, graphene oxide was successfully synthesized by modified Hummer's method and reduced using different easily available alcoholic medium to prepare rGO. The structural, chemical, electrical and optical properties of the resulting materials were investigated by FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, XRD analysis, EDX analysis, SEM imaging and UV-VIS spectroscopy. The XRD analysis reveals that the crystalline structure of rGO samples show the lower value of d-spacing and crystalline size than that in GO. FTIR result confirms the presence of different types of oxygen functionalities in GO, whereas there is the presence of less oxygen functional groups in rGO. The EDX result shows high C/O ratio in E-rGO attributing to more removal of oxygen functional groups than that in other rGO samples. Because of the above, higher conductivity was obtained in E-rGO sample. Moreover, the by-product of oxygen reduction using ethanol, methanol, 2-propanol and acetone are organic materials and water having no adverse effect on the environment. The synthesis of rGO using ethanol promises low cost and green technique of oxygen reduction with enhanced electrical conductivity. The lower value of the bandgap obtained in E-rGO may find efficient electronics and optoelctronics applications."
