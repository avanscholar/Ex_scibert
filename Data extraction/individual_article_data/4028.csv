0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) gas is an ideal energy carrier because of its high energy intensity, cleaning and non-polluting nature (Liu et al., 2018; Sivagurunathan et al., 2017). Currently, H2 is mainly produced by chemical processes such as steam reforming of hydrocarbons and coal gasification, which require the use of fossil fuels and could release greenhouse gas (Chalima et al., 2019). Recently, microbial H2 production by dark fermentation has gained substantial interest due to the advantages of energy-saving and environmental friendly (Yin and Wang, 2019). More importantly, it can deal with various kinds of waste biomass including solid waste and wastewater, which is beneficial to reducing the cost of energy production (Pawar et al., 2013; Quéméneur et al., 2012). Agricultural biomass residues are increasingly being considered as potential sources of dark fermentation. The annual yield of agricultural biomass residues are appropriately 1010 tons globally (Pawar et al., 2013). Most of them are not used properly, which leads to huge waste of renewable resources (Guo et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2008). Some studies have shown the effective production of H2 from agricultural biomass residues by dark fermentation (Chang et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2010). However, during the fermentation process, the generation of H2 is habitually accompanied with production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), which could result in a series of environmental issues (Chalima et al., 2019). Microalgae can make good use of organic acids as carbon source for cell growth, and the effluent from dark-fermentation could be utilized as the substrate to produce algal lipids (Chalima et al., 2019; Ghosh et al., 2017). A two-stage process of dark fermentation and microalgal culture potentially benefits both renewable energy production and waste reduction. Combined H2 and lipid production in a two-step process from glucose has been reported in a few previous studies (Ghosh et al., 2017). To date, the information is still lacking on co-production of H2 and lipids from agricultural biomass residues by combining dark fermentation with algal cultivation. In this study, the feasibility of combining dark fermentation with microalgal culture for energy recovery from various types of agricultural biomass residues was investigated in batch experiments. Furthermore, the two-stage system was operated in long-term operation to evaluate the H2 and lipid production performance. The energy conversion efficiencies for different agricultural biomass residues were examined."
1,Material and methods,
2,Pretreatment of agriculture biomass residues,"2.1 Pretreatment of agriculture biomass residues Agriculture biomass residues, i.e., corn cob (CC), corn stalk (CS), rice straw (RS), and wheat straw (WS), were obtained from the suburb of Harbin, China. They were air-dried and milled to pass a 40-mesh screen, and then the sample powders were dried at 60 °C for 24 h in an oven. The milled samples (solid-liquid ratio of 1:10 w/v) were mixed with H2SO4 solution (0.5 wt%), which were pretreated at 121 °C for 60 min (Guo et al., 2014). Afterwards, the mixtures were adjusted to pH 6.5 ± 0.1 according to previous reports (Chang et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2014)."
3,Seed microorganisms,"2.2 Seed microorganisms The anaerobic sludge collected from a wastewater treatment plant in Harbin was used as seed sludge (Ren et al., 2018). Prior to use, the sludge was heated at 100 °C for 30 min to inhibit the activity of methanogens and enrich the hydrogen-producing bacteria as described by Guo et al., 2014. Scenedesmus sp. was isolated from soil and can efficiently convert VFAs into lipids, and thus it was adopted for lipid accumulation in this work (Ren et al., 2018). Algal cells were maintained in the BG-11 medium at 25 ± 1 °C according to a report described previously (Ren et al., 2019b)."
4,Batch and continuous operations,"2.3 Batch and continuous operations 2.3.1 Batch culture mode In the batch experiments, dark fermentation was carried out in 250 mL reactors with a working volume of 100 mL. The heat-pretreated sludge, pretreated feedstock and nutrient solution were added to each reactor, respectively. The concentration of feedstock was 10 g L−1 and the nutrient solution was prepared according to previous reports (Li and Liu, 2012; Wang et al., 2010). Before use, the reactors containing fresh medium were flushed with pure nitrogen gas for 20 min to create anaerobic condition. The initial pH of culture medium was set at 6.5 ± 0.1 and the H2 production was conducted at 36 ± 1 °C in a temperature-controlled shaker (Chu et al., 2011). Before algal culture, the effluents of dark fermentation were collected and centrifuged at 9000 g for 10 min and filtered through 0.45 μm Millipore filter to remove the solids. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.1 and used for microalgal cultivation. The reactors for algal culture were shaken at 25 ± 1 °C. All the experiments were run in triplicates. 2.3.2 Continuous culture mode Continuous H2 production was conducted in 1 L anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) with a working volume of 0.6 L. The ASBR was made of glass with the diameter of 100 mm and height of 150 mm, respectively. The ASBR was fed with 10 g L−1 pretreated feedstock at hydraulic retention time of 24 h and operated at 36 ± 1 °C. In each cycle of operation, 0.3 L of culture medium in ASBR was replaced by 0.3 L of fresh pretreated corn stalk medium. Erlenmeyer flask (1 L) with a working volume of 0.6 L was adopted as sequencing batch reactor (SBR) for continuous lipid production. The SBR was made of glass with the diameter of 130 mm and height of 225 mm, respectively. The dark fermentative effluents were centrifuged at 9000 g for 10 min and filtered through 0.45 μm Millipore filter to remove the solids, which was used as the influent for microalgal cultivation. The SBR was initially operated in batch mode for 4 days to accumulate algal biomass for continuous culture. After that, half of culture medium (0.3 L) was replaced by the same volume of dark fermentative effluent, which was repeated every 2 days in the following algal culture process. The temperature of SBR was controlled at 25 ± 1 °C. During the fermentation course, H2 production, soluble metabolites concentrations, biomass and lipid concentrations were monitored with respect to cultivation time."
5,Energy conversion analysis,"2.4 Energy conversion analysis The specific heat value of H2, lipids, corn cob, corn stalk, rice straw and wheat straw was 142, 36.3, 18.4, 16.7, 17.6 and 19.1 kJ g−1, respectively (Dong et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2013; Pawar et al., 2013; Ren et al., 2019a; Yu et al., 2008). Energy conversion efficiency and total energy conversion efficiency was calculated according to Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. (1) Energy conversion efficiency % = Heat value of H 2 or lipids kJ Heat value of feedstock kJ × 100 % (2) Total energy conversion efficiency % = Heat value of H 2 kJ + heat value of lipids ( kJ ) Heat value of feedstock kJ × 100 %"
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The pH of medium was monitored using a digital pH meter (Mettler FE20K, Switzerland). The gas samples were collected from the head space of reactors using a gas-tight glass syringe. The content of H2 in gases was detected by a gas chromatograph (Agilent 4890D, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. Temperature of injector, oven and detector was set at 100, 80, and 150 °C, respectively (Guo et al., 2014). A gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector was used to determine the concentrations of VFAs and alcohols. Nitrogen gas was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 2.6 mL min−1. Temperature of injector, oven and detector was set at 200, 180, and 250 °C, respectively (Cheng and Liu, 2011). The lipid content of microalgae was analyzed according to previous description (Ren et al., 2018). The algal samples were filtered through 0.45 μm Millipore filter, which were dried at 105 °C overnight to measure the biomass concentration."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Dark fermentative H2 production from different agricultural biomass residues,"3.1 Dark fermentative H2 production from different agricultural biomass residues Corn cob (CC), corn stalk (CS), rice straw (RS) and wheat straw (WS) were adopted as feedstock to investigate their H2 production performance by dark fermentation. The H2 production immediately began after the start-up of batch reactors, whereas the H2 production performances were different (Fig. 1 A and B). Among them, CS was the best feedstock with the maximum H2 production of 762.3 mL L−1, H2 yield of 76.2 mL g−1 and H2 production rate of 7.94 mL L−1h−1. CC was also preferable substrate and exhibited lower H2 production of 686.4 mL L−1, H2 yield of 68.6 mL g−1 and H2 production rate of 7.15 mL L−1h−1. Moreover, RS led to poor H2 production of 425.7 mL L−1, H2 yield of 42.6 mL g−1 and H2 production rate of 4.43 mL L−1h−1. WS was not a suitable substrate under this experimental condition since the H2 yield was only 23.8 mL g−1. There have been some studies on dark fermentative H2 production from agricultural biomass residues. The co-culture of Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was developed to ferment corn stalk, resulting in H2 yield of 74.9 mL g−1 (Li and Liu, 2012). The strain Thermotoga neapolitana DSM 4359 was reported to produce H2 from rice straw with the yield of 50.8 mL g−1 (Nguyen et al., 2010). H2 production from wheat straw by mesophilic anaerobically-digested sludge was 18.1 mL g−1 (Quéméneur et al., 2012). Notably, the H2 yields obtained in this study were comparable or even higher compared to previous reports. The results indicate that corn fiber was a better feedstock for H2 production than wheat straw and rice straw. H2 production by dark fermentation is always accompanied by end products accumulation due to the acidogenic metabolism of anaerobic bacteria (Sivagurunathan et al., 2017). As shown in Fig. 1C, the main end products detected in the dark fermentation process were acetate and butyrate, and low amounts of propionate, valerate, ethanol and butanol were observed. For CS fermentation, the acetate and butyrate concentrations reached 881.2 and 1180.3 mg L−1, and these two acids in CC fermentation were 752.3 and 826.9 mg L−1, respectively. In WS fermentation, the concentration of acetate (913.1 mg L−1) was higher than that of butyrate (485.5 mg L−1). Moreover, when RS was used as the feedstock, low concentrations of acetate (587.5 mg L−1) and butyrate (234.6 mg L−1) were obtained. The presence of VFAs and alcohols in anaerobic fermentation of agricultural biomass residues has been widely reported (Chu et al., 2011). High performance of H2 production was noticed when major metabolites in the dark fermentative effluent were acetate and butyrate (Liu et al., 2014). Furthermore, acetate and butyrate were ideal substrate for subsequent lipid production as they can be consumed by algal cells."
9,Microalgal lipid production using dark fermentative effluents of agricultural biomass residues,"3.2 Microalgal lipid production using dark fermentative effluents of agricultural biomass residues In the algal culture reactor, the organic residues in the dark fermentative effluents were utilized by microalgae for lipid accumulation. It was found that the microalgae used in this work can efficiently assimilate the VFAs (mainly acetate and butyrate) in effluents. Almost all the VFAs were consumed at the end of algal culture, and the total residual VFAs were only 26.6–62.7 mg L−1 (Fig. 1D). Microalgae had selective preference in the utilization of organic acids, which originated from the differences in metabolic pathways (Chiranjeevi and Venkata Mohan, 2017). Due to its structural simplicity, low molecular weight and easy degradability, acetate can readily and directly be utilized by the microalgae for the TCA cycle and the metabolism of fatty acid synthesis (Chiranjeevi and Venkata Mohan, 2017). Butyrate can be converted to butyryl-CoA and then degraded to acetyl-CoA by β-oxidation, and hence the consumption rate of butyrate was lower than that of acetate (Ghosh et al., 2017). In addition, the concentrations of ethanol and butanol in effluents changed little compared with those before algal culture, and the residual alcohols in fermentation broth can be further recovered using the pervaporation process to produce concentrated alcohols (Ren et al., 2018). As shown in Fig. 1E and F, all the effluents of agricultural biomass residues can support the growth of algal cells, while the microalgae needed to take about 1 day to adapt to the new culture medium. After 6 days of cultivation, CS effluent led to the maximum algal biomass concentration of 1461.1 mg L−1, total lipid content of 35.2% and lipid productivity of 85.7 mg L−1 d−1, followed by the group supplemented with CC effluent (1133.2 mg L−1, 33.4% and 63.1 mg L−1 d−1) and WS effluent (1022.7 mg L−1, 30.7% and 52.3 mg L−1 d−1). When RS effluent was utilized as the substrate, the lowest biomass concentration of 583.9 mg L−1 and lipid productivity of 25.8 mg L−1 d−1 occurred, which could be caused by the low organic acids in RS effluent. Various components of effluents have been successfully used to cultivate microalgae in a few previous studies. Chlorella vulgaris grew well in the pretreated anaerobic digestion swine manure, and the highest microalgal biomass concentration of 1100 mg L−1 was obtained after 7 days of cultivation (Deng et al., 2017). Crypthecodinium cohnii can assimilate acetate, propionate or butyrate in fermentative effluent for omega-3 fatty acids production, and the total lipid content and docosahexaenoic acid content reached 24.6% and 29.8%, respectively (Chalima et al., 2019). Nguyen et al. indicate that Scenedesmus sp. can utilize CO2 and organic carbon in digestion effluent, which resulted in algal specific growth rate of 0.15–0.18 d−1 (Thi Nguyen et al., 2019). The feasibility of using dark fermentative effluents from agricultural biomass residues for algal biomass and lipid production has been demonstrated in this study. The energy conversion efficiencies from different agricultural biomass residues were calculated in Table 1 . In dark fermentation, the energy conversion efficiency for the CC, CS, RS and WS was 4.73%, 5.78%, 3.07% and 1.58%, respectively. In the two-stage process, the total energy conversion efficiency for the CC, CS, RS and WS increased to 12.2%, 16.96%, 6.26% and 7.55%, respectively. The difference in energy conversion efficiencies was mainly due to the different concentrations of VFAs in dark fermentative effluents. Moreover, it could be clearly clarified that the energy conversion efficiency obtained from algal culture process was higher than that of H2 production process. The results demonstrated that the two-stage process of dark fermentation and microalgal cultivation not only removed the VFAs in fermentative effluents but also produced simultaneously the clean and readily usable bioenergy. What’s more, it is essential to further investigate the performance of the system in long-term operation."
10,Energy production with corn stalk as feedstock in long-term operation,"3.3 Energy production with corn stalk as feedstock in long-term operation There are few reports on the co-production of H2 and lipids from agricultural biomass residues in long-term operation. After 9 days of operation, the ASBR reached steady state with an average H2 production rate of 811.1 mL L−1 d−1 (Fig. 2 A). The soluble end products in the effluent of ASBR were mainly composed of acetate and butyrate, the average concentration of which was 966.4 and 1350.4 mg L−1, respectively (Fig. 2B). Besides, other fermentation end products including propionate, valerate, ethanol and butanol were generated in much lower concentrations. The result reveal that the metabolism in ASBR was a butyrate-type fermentation (Wang et al., 2010). In a study, the CS was used as feedstock for H2 production using mixed anaerobic culture in a continuous ASBR, and the maximum H2 production rate of 490 mL L−1 d−1 was observed (Sivagurunathan et al., 2017). Comparison of the H2 production performance in literature indicates that the result of this study was promising. The effluent of ASBR was initially fed into SBR at batch mode for 4 days to accumulate the algal biomass. At day 4, the biomass and lipid production was 862.2 and 381.2 mg L−1, respectively (Fig. 2C). After that, the operation of SBR changed from batch culture to continuous operation. Stable biomass and end products were observed from day 8. The average concentration of microalgal biomass and lipid reached 1558.2 and 588.5 mg L−1, respectively. At the end of each algal culture cycle, VFAs concentrations in SBR sharply decreased and more than 98.5% of VFAs were degraded (Fig. 2D). It is worth mentioning that soluble organic matter in SBR can be efficiently used by microalgae and dark fermentative effluent from CS was an appropriate substrate for long-term algal lipid production. Combination of dark fermentation and microagal culture for utilizing agricultural biomass residues could possibly be an alternative process to produce H2 and lipids. This is the first report which shows H2 and lipid production from CS in long-term operation. The microalgae enriched in the bioreactor were able to consume organic acids generated in dark fermentation process, which could avoid the potential threat of fermentative metabolites to the ecological environment. Further work is needed to investigate the co-production of H2 and lipids in large-scale reactor with agricultural biomass residues as the feedstock and evaluate its process economy."
11,Conclusions,"Co-production of H2 and lipids from agricultural biomass residues by combining dark fermentation with microalgal cultivation has been proved to be an ideal manner for acquiring high energy recovery. Compared with CC, RS and WS, CS as feedstock for dark fermentation produced more H2 and lipids with the maximum energy conversion efficiency. Dark fermentative effluent from CS was a good substrate for algal lipid accumulation. The two-stage process was steadily operated in long-term operation and exhibited high energy production and VFAs degradation performances. This study provides a sustainable strategy to convert agricultural biomass residues into bioenergy and reduce environmental risk."
