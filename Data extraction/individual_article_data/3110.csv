0,Introduction,"Diesel motor vehicles are widely used in the transportation and industry sectors and the ability of these vehicles to work with alternative fuels brings great benefits, both environmental and economic. Oxygenated fuels such as biodiesel and alcohols have the potential to provide a reliable and cost-effective alternative to the increasing energy demands of diesel engines. The most suitable alternative fuel to diesel engine technology and combustion principles is biodiesel fuel produced from inedible sources. Biodiesel can replace a large amount of the diesel demand to generate power for industries and for the diesel engines of vehicles [1]. Because biodiesel has similar properties to diesel and improves exhaust gas emission, it is already used in diesel engines under various methods. In recent years, biodiesel made of inedible oils has been increasingly widely used. Countries have legal arrangements for biodiesel production from inedible oils, and so making biodiesel from waste vegetable oils and fried oils contributes to solving the legal side of producing these fuels [2]. In spite of the many advantages of using biodiesels, most researchers have reported higher NOx emissions, which is a deterrent to the market expansion of these fuels. Increasing concerns on environment and sustainability have led to initiatives to reduce the emissions and environmental damage caused by humans. In order to abate emissions, stringent vehicle emission regulations have been implemented throughout the world in recent decades to protect not only the environment, but also public health [3]. In order to use biodiesel in diesel engines, two important aspects must be considered. Fuel properties will need to be improved in order to use biodiesel in diesel engines at higher mixing ratios. Research on the use of biodiesel in diesel engines, has generally recommended that biodiesel be mixed with diesel fuel at a maximum 20% (B20) blend ratio. The other option is to use additional additives to improve fuel properties. However, this action increases the production cost of the fuel. Likewise, to meet the stringent emission norms, there are various NOx reduction technologies like use of additives, retarding fuel injection timing, water emulsion, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and advanced in-cylinder combustion strategies [4,5]. Simultaneous reduction of NOx emissions is very difficult to achieve in diesel engines due to the inherent trade-off relation between combustion and NOx occurring mechanism. LTC is a strategy that offers a promising solution to reduce NOx. The key characteristic of LTC is a thoroughly premixed fuel/air mixture that burns at low temperature following a long ignition delay period [6,7]. Therefore, to mitigate the effects of high EGR rates and retarded injection timing, a fuel with lower cetane number and higher volatility, like an alcohol, can be utilized [8–10]. S-LTC can be achieved through a fuel-based modification to provide low temperature combustion performance apart from the emission reduction methods and technologies. To further such efforts, higher alcohols, are coming to the forefront as a conceivable alternative fuel to consider [11]. Higher alcohols with three to five carbon numbers are renewable fuels for blending with diesel fuel, but the separation and purification of the alcohols from solution by fermentation is of great economic significance [12]. Higher alcohols are an attractive alternative fuel because they are a renewable bio-based resource and it is oxygenated, thereby providing the potential to reduce harmful emissions in compression-ignition engines. Recently, higher carbon alcohols such as C3H7–OH (propanol), C4H9–OH (n-butanol) and C5H11–OH (1-pentanol) are getting attention because of their advantages over the low carbon alcohols, and therefore, have more potential in being the next generation of key biofuels [13]. Generally, propanol, butanol and pentanol have higher cetane numbers, calorific values, viscosities, and flame speeds while having lower latent heat of evaporations, ignition temperatures and corrosion risks when compared to low carbon alcohols [14,15]. Moreover, these higher alcohols can easily be blended with biodiesel without any phase separation, which is attributed to their high carbon content, low polarity, and less hygroscopic nature [16]. In this case, C3-C5 alcohols can be suitable candidates for S-LTC. The addition of higher alcohol to biodiesel is one of the methods to reduce the density and viscosity and improve the overall properties of fuel blends. Higher alcohols are suitable additive or supplementary fuel for biodiesel, which provides higher oxygen and increases the heat of evaporation of the fuel and consequently reduces the exhaust emissions [17]. As higher alcohols have a lower heating value and higher latent heat of vaporization compared to diesel and biodiesel, more heat will be absorbed during vaporization of alcohols [18]. Thus, the use of oxygen-rich alcohols improves both premixed and diffusion combustion stages [19]. The syngestric effects from both a lower heating value (LHV) and LHE on the energy adsorbed by the air-fuel mixture determined that oxygenated fuels would have S-LTC. S-LTC mode includes longer ignition delay and better mixture preparation compared with conventional diesel engine combustion. In this case, higher alcohols are considered more favorable for S-LTC operation than neat diesel because they have greater resistant ability to auto-ignition and hence provide longer ignition delay due to their lower CN and higher LHE [20–24]. Thus, instead of mixing B20 in diesel fuel, it is possible to improve the fuel properties and reduce pollutant emissions by mixing biodiesel with higher alcohols. According to the literature review, the S-LTC concept has not been used yet and there are no studies examining higher alcohol-biodiesel mixtures that may be an alternative to B20 fuel. In addition, there are very few studies in the literature on the use of biodiesel with C3, C4 and C5 alcohols. Although propanol-C3 is used in diesel engines with diesel, there are currently no detailed studies that attempted biodiesel blend operation of propanol in diesel engines. There is conclusive evidence from the literature that C3 can be mixed with diesel without any phase separation up to 20% v/v [3–5,15]. In a similar line, C3 can also be mixed with vegetable oils without the need of an emulsifying agent up to 30% v/v. C4 is also coming to the forefront in many studies [21–25]. Liu et al. [20] used a constant volume combustion chamber to test soybean biodiesel-butanol blends. They indicated that proper choosing of the fuel will be very important to achieve high efficiency and clean low-temperature combustion. Yilmaz et al. [22] studied the performance and emissions using waste cooking oil biodiesel-butanol (5, 10 and 15%) blends in the same engine. The result showed that EGT and NOx emissions decreased whereas CO and HC emissions increased for biodiesel–butanol blend as compared to diesel fuel. Zheng et al. [24] conducted research on a single-cylinder engine to investigate the differences between the two combustion modes fueled with biodiesel/n-butanol at different EGR rates (0%, 30% and 50%), n-butanol ratios (20%, 50% and 80%), injection timings and engine loads (low, medium, high). Results showed that the ignition delay of a blended mode is longer than that of Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) mode, and more sensitive to n-butanol ratio and EGR rate. Killol et al. [25] investigated the effects of karanja biodiesel n-butanol (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) blends on the performance and emission parameters of a direct injection (DI) diesel engine. Based on the results, 15% n-butanol blend was chosen as the optimum fuel blend. Nanthagopal et al. investigated the effect of 1-pentanol and 1-butanol (40%, 50% and 60%) with Calophyllum Inophyllum biodiesel on diesel engine characteristics under various engine loads. Although their results showed lower BTE and higher BSFC, there were reductions in NOx emission due to their higher latent heat of vaporization [26]. The combustion, gaseous and particulate emissions of a diesel engine fueled with waste cooking oil biodiesel n-pentanol (10%, 20% and 30%) blends were examined by Zhu et al. [27]. The results indicated that with the increased pentanol fraction, the start of combustion was delayed. The addition of 10% n-pentanol to biodiesel was recommended as a suitable replacement ratio for diesel engines. Ma et al. [28] investigated the effects of n-pentanol addition to waste cooking oil biodiesel in different ratios (0%, 20%, and 40%) on spray, ignition and combustion characteristics in a constant volume combustion bomb. Based on the general outcome of this study, the addition of n-pentanol could significantly improve the spray and combustion characteristics of waste cooking oil biodiesel. Most of the researchers had suggested that optimum blends from their respective studies have the capability to completely eliminate diesel from compression ignition (CI) engines [29–33]. However, little study has been undertaken to systematically investigate the effect of higher alcohols and biodiesel blends. Such biodiesel-alcohol blends may eliminate the problem of using a higher percentage of biodiesel blends in unmodified CI engines. Most of the research has also reported that EGT and BSFC increases while exhaust emissions reduce with the use of mixed feedstock [34–38]. Having this motivation in mind, to achieve S-LTC, the engine performance and emissions of waste oil methyl ester (80% by volume) and higher alcohols of C3, C4 and C5 (20% by volume) blends were investigated. Moreover, cold flow fuel properties of the blends were determined. Regulated exhaust emissions and engine performance characteristics are reported for the higher alcohol blends and compared to those of diesel and waste oil methyl ester."
1,Experimental facility and specifications,"Experiments were performed on an Onan DJC type, indirect injected, four-cylinder diesel engine generator (Fig. 1 ). The main technical characteristics of the test engine are tabulated in Table 1 . The exhaust emissions were measured with an EMS 5002 exhaust gas analyzer. The analyzer provided a HC measurement range of 0–2000 ppm with a resolution of 1 ppm, CO range of 0–10 vol% with a resolution of 0.01 vol%, CO2 range of 0–20 vol% with a resolution of 0.1 vol%, O2 range of 0–25 vol% with a resolution of 0.01 vol% and NO range of 0–5000 ppm with a resolution of 1 ppm. In order to perform the EMS 5002 exhaust gas analyzer calibration procedure, BAR 97 Low gas was used. The calibration process was repeated regularly for the engine tests. The engine was operated running neat diesel for at least ten minutes prior to switching to an auxiliary fuel tank containing the pentanol blends. This prevented the occurrence of cold-start effects. The mass of the fuel was weighed before and after each 20-minute trial in order to find the mass of fuel consumed for each blend during each trial. A type K thermocouple was used to measure the exhaust gas temperature. This series of engine performance and exhaust emission tests was conducted on an unmodified engine operating at a fixed engine speed (1800 rpm) under four engine loads (0, 3, 6, and 9 kW) applied by the use of electrical resistance elements. Experiments were repeated three times in order to increase confidence in measurements of engine performance parameters and exhaust gas emissions; averaged values are reported in this work."
2,Tested fuels,"The waste oil methyl ester used in this study was produced from waste cooking oil collected from restaurants. The conversion of waste cooking oil into biodiesel was performed through three stage transesterification process. The composition of biodiesel mainly depends on its feedstock. In order to identify the composition of biodiesel used in this study, the fatty acid composition of the waste oil biodiesel was tested using the EN 15779 method, utilizing an Agilent Technologies 6890 Network Gas Chromatograph system. The gas chromatograph column used was DB-225 (30 m long, 0.25 mm diameter and 0.2 µm film thickness). Analysis of the waste cooking oil biodiesel showed that it consisted of 81.4% unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and 13.28% saturated FAMEs. A breakdown of the FAME composition measured in weight percentage can be found in Table 2 . Ultra-low-sulfur highway diesel was purchased from Valero. Propanol (CAS No: 71-23-8), n-butanol (CAS No: 71-36-3), and 1-pentanol (CAS No: 71-41-0) of technical grade (99.9% purity) was obtained from Univar Chemistry. These higher alcohols are next generation biofuels that can be produced from sugary, starchy and lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks using sustainable pathways. Propanol is primarily produced from petrochemicals by oxo-synthesis, which is currently the most cost-effective process. Butanol can be produced from both five and six carbon sugars without organism modification. Pentanol is also an excellent renewable alternative because it can be produced from biological pathways like natural microbial fermentation using engineered micro-organisms [35]. The properties of propanol, n-butanol and 1-pentanol are given in Table 3 . Test blends were prepared by the splash-blending method, which is the most common and cost-effective method. 20% (by volume) C3, C4 and C5 were blended with WB to create WBC3, WBC4 and WBC5 test fuels respectively."
3,Properties of blended fuels,"3.1 Properties of blended fuels The main factors that determine the quality of blended fuels, engine performance and exhaust emissions are the basic fuel properties. The density, lower heating value, cetane number, kinematic viscosity, flash point, cloud point (CP) and cold filter plugging point (CFPP) are the important fuel properties that describe the effects of blended fuels on performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine [39]. The basic properties of diesel, WB, WBC3, WBC4 and WBC5 blends were tested as per the ASTM test methods, and the obtained values are given in Table 4 . The addition of higher alcohols to WB is one of the effective methods to reduce the density and viscosity and improve the overall properties of fuel blends. It was determined that the fuel properties of the blended fuels met the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. The density, lower heating value, cetane number, kinematic viscosity, flash point were reduced due to the addition of C3, C4 and C5 alcohols to WB. The cetane number is a very important property for CI engine combustion processes. According to the ASTM D975 standard, the cetane number should be 40 for diesel fuel, with values of 40–55 typical [26]. Also, higher alcohol blended fuels, which have the cetane number of 44.10, 45.12 and 45.60, have no need for any cetane improver or additive. The physicochemical properties of higher alcohols such as density, kinematic viscosity and molecular structure etc. have influenced the fuel properties and phase stability of the biodiesel-higher alcohols blends. Compared with lower carbon alcohols, using higher alcohols results in better solubility to biodiesel fuel due to its higher carbon numbers and lower polarity. For this purpose, phase stability of all test fuels was tested at 10 °C and ambient temperature and no phase separation was found after fifteen days for all the blends. Cold flow properties are very important for biodiesel and its blends [21]. Addition of higher alcohols to WB improved the CP and CFPP. This means that all higher alcohol blends can be used without adding any cold flow improver at low temperature operability."
4,Results and discussion,"In order to find out the feasibility of WB blends from the engine performance and emission point of views, the blended fuels were used to test a diesel engine at different load. The engine performance and emission and characteristics are discussed in the following the sections and the results are compared to the diesel fuel and WB."
5,Performance characteristics,"4.1 Performance characteristics The important engine performance parameters such as BSFC, BTE and EGT are discussed in the following sections. 4.1.1 BSFC The variations of BSFCs as a function of engine load for diesel fuel, WB and the WBC3, WBC4 and WBC5 blends are shown in Fig. 2 . The BSFC is a measure of how efficiently an engine is using the fuel supplied, and therefore a lower BSFC value is always desirable [40,41]. In order to maintain the same power output as if it were running on neat diesel or WB, an engine running higher alcohol blends must consume more fuel [42]. In this case, BSFC suffers due to the lower energy content of higher alcohols [10,43]. Diesel fuel presents the lowest BSFC under all the loading conditions and this is due to the higher energy content of the diesel fuel. Compared to that of diesel, the BSFC of WB increased by 12.38%. The addition of higher alcohols to WB had a negative effect on BSFCs, as seen in Fig. 2. The BSFC for all blends containing C3-C5 was higher than that of WB at all engine loads. The primary cause of this is that WBC3-C5 has a lower calorific value than WB, as shown in Table 4. The higher oxygen content of these higher alcohols (26.62%, 21.59% and 18.15%) decreases the calorific value, which causes more consumption of fuel for the same power output. Compared to that of WB, the BSFC of WBC3, WBC4 and WBC5 increased by 8.90%, 6.56% and 5.02%, respectively. Due to C3-C5 alcohol’s high latent heat of evaporation, heat is lost from the combustion chamber due to evaporation, which causes a cooling effect and reduces combustion efficiency. These higher alcohols also increase the BSFC because, compared to WB, it has a lower heat combustion. Similar results have also been reported showing that BSFC values increased with using higher alcohols [30,31,36]. When the effects of higher alcohols on BSFC are compared in terms of low fuel consumption, the order from best to worst was as follows: WBC5, WBC4, WBC3. 4.1.2 BTE Thermal efficiency is a measure of the output work divided by the input energy in a thermal engine [16]. Fig. 3 represents the comparison of BTE as a function of engine load for the test fuels. Since BTE is inversely proportional to the lower heating value and BSFC, it decreases with respect to load as BSFC increases in Fig. 3. As seen in the figure, BTE increases with respect to the engine load for all the fuel blends. This can be attributed to the increase in power output and reduction in heat carried away by coolant at higher loads. The mean BTE values of WB, WBC3, WBC4 and WBC5 were found to be 19.67%, 19.22%, 19.32% and 19.43%, respectively. Compared to that of diesel fuel, the BTE of WB decreased by 1.45%. The average reduction in BTE from WBC3, WBC4 and WBC5 were 3.11%, 2.52% and 2.09%, compared to neat WB. BTE is inversely related to BSFC and has a lower heating value, meaning it decreases with respect to load as BSFC increases [37]. As seen in Table 4, WBC3, WBC4 and WBC5 have lower cetane numbers than WB. A lower cetane number causes longer ignition delay, which increases the amount of fuel accumulation inside the combustion chamber before the first ignition. The addition of higher alcohols prolongs the ignition delay of the blends. Due to ignition delay, it takes longer for a fuel to fully combust and heat transfer to the engine components increases. Thus, useful energy which can be converted to brake power inside the cylinder, decreases, which leads to higher BSFC and lower BTE [17,39]. Also, the calorific value of blended fuels becomes a dominant factor and thereby decreases the BTE. It was found that the BTE of WC5 was slightly more effective than WBC4 and WBC3. The improvement of the BTE with C5 addition can also be explained by the different fuel properties, combined with its strong combustion performance [17,26,34]. 4.1.3 EGT The EGT reflects the heat released inside the combustion chamber and has appreciable influence on the formation of pollutants [43]. The variation in EGT as a function of engine load for all fuel blends is shown in Fig. 4 . As seen in the figure, EGT increased with an increase of the engine load for all tested blends. It can be attributed to a higher amount of fuel burned at higher loads, which led to higher exhaust gas temperatures [13]. The average increase of EGT of WB as compared with that of diesel was measured to be 6.24%. This is due to WB increasing the number of oxygen-rich regions in the combustion chamber, which leads to regional temperature peaks and higher EGT. Compared to neat WB, WBC3, WBC4 and WBC5 blends showed an increase in exhaust gas temperature by 23.17%, 33.12%, 30.73%, respectively. This observed increase in exhaust gas temperature is primarily a result of the lower cetane number of WB blends compared to that of diesel fuel and WB. Ignition delay is increased with fuels that have a lower cetane number because the fuel accumulates in the combustion chamber [23,27]. At the onset of combustion, the amount of fuel that is experiencing diffusion combustion increases, leading to higher exhaust gas temperatures [14,18,31]. Fig. 4 shows a significant increase in exhaust gas temperature due to the addition of C3-C5 to WB. Because of binary blends’ low cetane number, fuel blends containing it exhibit longer ignition delays and higher exhaust gas temperatures. Overall, the results on the engine performance indicate that WBC5 blends show less variations in BSFC, a slightly higher BTE and EGT, and are therefore more suitable for applications in CI engines compared to neat WB."
6,Exhaust emission characteristics,"4.2 Exhaust emission characteristics In the following sections, regular exhaust emissions produced by diesel engine such as HC, NOx and CO when operated with diesel fuel, WB and WB/C3-C5 blends are discussed for S-LTC and the results are compared with diesel fuel and WB. 4.2.1 HC emissions The formation of HC emission of a diesel engine is a direct indication of the combustion quality. Basic fuel properties such as cetane number, the heat of evaporation, air-fuel ratio and oxygen content and engine operating conditions are the factors that determine the formation of unburned HC [44–46]. The variations of HC emissions as a function of engine load are shown in Fig. 5 . As seen in the figure, the formation of HC emissions at no load condition is higher than full load (9 kW). This situation is due to the over the lean limit of the air/fuel mixture, and the lower cylinder wall temperature affects the flame speed and penetration which leads to incomplete combustion. Also, the reduced temperatures can increase the HC emissions; thus, higher HC emissions were recorded due to lower combustion temperature for WB and its blends. The total HC emission is increased by 25.37% for WB compared to diesel. It can be attributed to higher density and viscosity of WB which create fuel-lean regions [26]. Based on the results shown in Fig. 5, WBC3, WBC4 and WBC5 increased HC emissions by 5.32%, 6.22% and 2.86% compared to WB. This is attributed to the higher latent heat of evaporation and lower cetane number of C3-C5 alcohols, which allows for a broader lean outer flame zone and quenching effect leading to higher HC emissions [22]. Furthermore, prolonged ignition delay (reduced auto ignition performance), short combustion duration (residence time) and the retarded combustion phasing towards later in the expansion stroke lead to higher HC. Similar results have previously been found by Yilmaz et al. [22], Nanthagopal et al. [26] and Zhu et al. [27]. The maximum values of HC emissions with WBC3, WBC4 and WBC5 were found to be 7.18 ppm, 7.34 ppm and 6.55 ppm at 6 kW, respectively. WBC5 has average lower HC emission compared to the other WB blends due to its higher BTE, shown in Fig. 3, and due to the positive effect of oxygen content and number of carbons (Table 3). These effects dominate the other properties of WB blends such as density, viscosity and flash point (Table 4). 4.2.2 NOX emissions The major harmful emission of CI engines is NOx, which causes adverse effects on humans and the environment. It should be controlled and reduced to meet the stringent emission regulations. The NOx formation of oxygenated biofuel blends is very complex. There are many different important factors such as cetane number, density, volatility, degree of unsaturation, oxygen content and fuel composition that can influence NOx emissions [41]. The formation of NOx in an IC engine depends on thermal (Zeldovich), prompt (Fenimore) and fuel mechanisms [44]. The thermal NOx formation mechanism is the dominant source of NOx in diesel engines [45,46]. Production of NOx emissions increases significantly with long fuel blend residence times at high temperatures inside the cylinder, to nearly 1800 K [19]. Fig. 6 shows the variations of NOx emissions with respect to engine load. It can be observed from Fig. 6 that the NOx emission of WB decreased by 6.83% compared to those of diesel fuel. NOx emissions from WB may be associated with the oxygen content and the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acid, which may provide low temperature for NOx formation. This can be attributed to the high degree of saturation of the WB chain (Table 2). In other words, NOx emissions increase by increasing the number of double bonds (C18:2 and C18:3) of fatty acid methyl esters [10]. Similar results were observed by several other researchers [47]. The cetane number is a very crucial property for blended fuels and a lower cetane number causes long ignition delay, resulting in increasing the inside cylinder temperature. The NOx emissions are increased with an increase in engine load, which can be attributed to a rise in combustion temperature. However, C3, C4 and C5 have higher latent heat evaporation values, which reduce the in-cylinder combustion temperature (to evaporate the fuel inside the cylinder) and it causes more ignition delay with more time available for effective air/fuel mixture preparation, ultimately resulting in a decrease of NOx emissions. According to this, NOx emissions are reduced by 31.59%, 25.67% and 25.85%, respectively to those of the WB, due to the low combustion temperature. Results in this work showed that this LHE factor was more dominant than the effect of lower cetane number on the reduction of NOx emissions for WB blends [17]. It can be concluded that the reduction in NOx emission in comparative order is WC3, WBC5 and WBC4. The S-LTC involves reducing the in-cylinder temperature and alleviating the formation of NOx. Hence, S-LTC has been mostly achieved by LHE and the use of C3, C4 and C5 as biodiesel additive may serve as a pre-combustion treatment method to reduce NOx emissions without any engine modification. 4.2.3 CO emissions The variations of CO emissions with engine load for test fuels are shown in Fig. 7 . It can be observed that the CO emissions show an increasing trend in the no load (0 kW) condition due to the over lean air/fuel mixtures and decreasing trend at higher loads (6 and 9 kW), because of the fuel rich zones. The CO emission of WB increased by 39.63% compared to diesel fuel. Because of the lack of oxygen or rich air/fuel ratio, CO emissions tend to increase [18,21]. Also, increased CO emissions for WB may be as a result of ignition and evaporation characteristics of WB with low cetane numbers. However, as shown at Fig. 7, WBC3, WBC4 and WBC5 blends decreased CO emissions an average of 1.74%, 3.49% and 3.90%, respectively as compared to WB. This may be attributed to the presence of CO emission in rich spray core and that temperature plays a key role for oxidizing of CO to CO2. Also, the higher local oxygen concentration in cylinder can reduce CO emissions. Thus, the oxygen content of WBC3, WBC4 and WBC5 enhance the CO oxidation and reduce CO emissions. This process results in more CO emissions for WBC3 at 0 kW. Similar to HC emissions, the WBC5 blend has lower average CO emission as compared to other blends. This reduction was attributed to the cetane number of WBC5 and low oxygen concentration of C5, which reduce the formation of CO emissions [22,26]. Hence, the reduction in CO emission for WB blends may be oxygen content and carbon molecules in blended fuel structures, which decrease the formation of CO emission [48]."
7,Conclusions,"Biodiesel and higher alcohols have become very important alternative fuels for diesel engines due to their renewability and improvement in combustion. Addition of higher alcohols to biodiesel can reduce the density, viscosity, improve atomization, auto-ignition characteristics and provide additional oxygen content and thus, have the potential to provide S-LTC and reduce NOx emissions. The potential bio-alcohols such as C3, C4 and C5 can be produced from waste or lignocellulosic materials with advanced production techniques and used as additives to biodiesel in IC engines. For this purpose, in order to achieve S-LTC, engine performance and exhaust emissions of a diesel engine running on various blends of WBC3, WBC4 and WBC5 were investigated. Moreover, cold flow properties of WB blends which are very crucial for biodiesel, were measured. It was found that the addition of higher alcohols to the WB leads to a significant improvement in cold flow properties such as CP and CFPP for low temperature operability. The engine tests involved no fuel additive nor any modification and results were compared with those fueled with diesel fuel and WB. According to overall test results, BSFC increased due to lower cetane number and lower heating values of the blends. Because of the low heating value of WB blends and high latent heat of evaporation of higher alcohols, there was a drop in flame temperature and NOx emissions for WBC3, WBC4 and WBC5. Hence, the use of C3, C4 and C5 can enable S-LTC strategy in CI engines, which presents a significant reduction in NOx. Furthermore, they can be considered as one of the most promising pre-combustion treatment methods compared to the other strategies for NOx reduction. Based on the general outcome of this study, the most important advantage of propanol, n-butanol and 1-pentanol is that they can be safely used in CI engines without any engine modification or any additive. They can be blended with biodiesel (20% by volume) instead of diesel fuel. However, further investigations should be conducted in order to make them viable commercially and meet the required stringent emission standards."
