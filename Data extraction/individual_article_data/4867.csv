0,Introduction,"Bio-hydrogen is one of the most promising and cleanest energy carriers in this century because of its least negative effect on the environment. Fermentation H2 evolution utilizing biomass waste as feedstock, such as crop stalks, opens up a new avenue to produce clean energy sources, which has the advantages of recycling utilization of renewable resource, low cost, energy-efficient and less emission, providing a new alternative to environmental and energy issues as well as a platform for the hydrogen economy. Therefore it has been paid considerable attention to bio-hydrogen production from biomass waste in recent decades. Cellulosic biomass is an abundant renewable resource on earth. Only in China, the annual output of agricultural waste alone exceeds 0.7billion tons. Among them, the amount of corn stalk is around 220million tons. Presently, these waste has still not been effectively utilized. Most of them are left unutilized in harvested fields, which has brought the more and more serious environment questions. According to the best of our knowledge, it is a formidable challenge for the direct conversion of natural cellulosic biomass into bio-hydrogen by hydrogen-producing bacteria due to its highly polymeric structure (such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) and hard biodegradability, hence, prior to hydrogen fermentation, these cellulosic biomass have to be hydrolyzed to soluble sugar because most hydrogen-producing bacteria find soluble substrates much easier to digest. So far different hydrolysis strategies for cellulosic biomass have been tried to promote the generation of hydrogen, including mechanical methods, physical methods, chemical methods, biological methods and a combination of these methods, etc. (Jung et al., 2011; Quemeneur et al., 2012; Nissila et al., 2014). However, the disadvantages should not be ignored in hydrolysis process of substrate, such as relatively high energy consumption, equipment corrosion, generating inhibitory by-products in acid/alkali pre-treatment process and time-consuming of biological pretreatment, etc., undoubtedly leading to the increase of production cost. Until fairly recently, Zhi and Wang (2014) reported a hydrogen yield of 78.5ml/g from wheat straw by Clostridium perfringens, and the wheat straw had to be pre-treated by combining fungal with crude cellulases prior to use. Zheng et al. (2014) found a thermophilic anaerobic bacteria which could effectively utilize cellulose to generate hydrogen, but mesophilic anaerobic bacteria could not. After that, Cao et al. (2014) also reported a thermophilic cellulolytic bacteria M18 which could directly convert corn stalk into hydrogen by hot fermentation of 60°C. Lately, our group also found a mesophilic anaerobic bacteria FS3 that could directly convert raw corn stalk to hydrogen at 36°C, but the strain could only just degrade hemicellulose while the cellulose could not be degraded (Song et al., 2014). As mentioned above, the useful information is still lacking on the hydrogen producing bacteria that could directly convert cellulosic biomass into bio-hydrogen without substrate pretreatment under mesophilic condition. Assuming that the hydrogen production bacteria which directly convert cellulosic substrate into bio-hydrogen could be isolated through microbial acclimation, the limitation as stated above would be overcome. Inspired by the latest research work in our group as mentioned above, in this context, we attempted to acclimate cow dung compost with pure MCC as sole carbon source under mesophilic and anaerobic conditions to isolate a dominant strain which could directly convert cellulosic biomass into hydrogen, and then the following research mainly focused on the physiologic and biochemical characteristics of the isolated strain. Furthermore, the hydrogen production performance of the isolated strain was specifically investigated in batch cultivation."
1,Methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Air-dried corn stalk (CS) was collected from a single field in the suburb of Zhengzhou City, and was stored in PP (polypropylene) plastic bag for about a year at ambient temperature. Prior to use, the sample of corn straw was milled by a vegetation disintegrator (FZ102) to pass through a 40-mesh screen and become homogeneous, and stored in sealed plastic bags at 4°C. Its characteristics was as follows: total solid (TS) 93.5%, total volatile solid (TVS) 83.9%, the soluble sugar (SS) 22.6mg/g-TS, cellulose 36.2%, hemicellulose 30.8% and lignin 15.3%. Both microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was reagent grade, purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. and used without further treatment."
3,Environment samples,"2.2 Environment samples Cow dung compost, as the natural microflora, was obtained from the dairy in Henan Agricultural University. Prior to use, the compost was mixed with tap-water according to the solid/liquid ratio of 1:4 (m/m) in a Teflon vessel (50ml) and then pretreated by microwave radiation for 1.5min to suppress the activity of hydrogen-consuming bacteria as much as possible, and harvest high yield hydrogen-producing spore-forming anaerobes (Song et al., 2012)."
4,Microbial acclimation,"2.3 Microbial acclimation MCC was used as sole carbon source for microbial acclimation. The microbial acclimation was performed with 150ml serum vial as batch reactor filled to 50ml of mixture comprising the pretreated compost by microwave irradiation, MCC with certain concentration and a little NH4HCO3 as nitrogen source under anaerobic condition at 35±1°C. After about 7days of cultivation, the resultant culture (30% inoculation amount, v/v) was transferred to another serum vial containing MCC and tap water for another 7days. The process was repeated at least 14 times successively in the same manner until the MCC color was beginning from white to a slight tint of yellow and a small amount of hydrogen could be detected by Gas Chromatograph (GC) except for MCC dosage was changed from 0.5% to 7.0% in this stage. After that, in the following cultivations, the KH2PO4 of 1.0g/l was added to the bioreactor to buffer the pH changes of the medium. The MCC dosage was changed from 7.0% to 10.0% and the culture period was gradually reduced to about 3days. The enrichment cultures were performed until the optimal hydrogen production was detected after at least 30 rounds of cultivations, the microbial medium became turbidity and the MCC color changed into faint yellow in the serum bottle, which was used as seed microbes for the following experiments."
5,Screening for hydrogen-producing bacteria,"2.4 Screening for hydrogen-producing bacteria The bacterial samples were collected from the effluent of hydrogen fermentation in an anaerobic bioreactor which was seeded with the seed microbes (see Section 2.3) and raw corn straw of 10g/l when the hydrogen production was in the logarithmic growth phase. The basal fermentation medium used for isolation and cultivation of hydrogen-producing strains was as follows: 10g/l glucose, 3g/l peptone, 1g/l yeast extract, 1g/l KH2PO4, 1g/l K2HPO4, 0.5g/l l-cysteine·HCl·H2O, 0.1g/l FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1g/l MgCl2. The hydrogen-producing bacteria were screened and isolated based on our previous work (Pan et al., 2008). The colony with the highest hydrogen production activity was selected for further analysis. The strains were stored at −18°C in a sterile glycerol of 20% (v/v) with an anaerobic environment."
6,Morphological test,"2.5 Morphological test Morphological examinations were performed with a light microscope CH-30 (Olympus, Japan) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) S-4800 (Hitachi, Japan). Gram staining was performed by the Hucker method, as described by Doetsch (1981)."
7,Strain identification,"2.6 Strain identification Genomic DNA was extracted from cell with the standard method (Sambrook and Russell, 2001) and the 16S rDNA gene was amplified by PCR as described by Chen et al. (2001). The 16S rDNA gene sequence was analyzed using BLAST Search against the GenBank database. The 16S rDNA gene sequences of closely related taxa obtained from the GenBank database were aligned using CLUSTAL X (Thompson et al., 1997). Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the program MEGA 5.0 (Tamura et al., 2007). Distance matrices were calculated according to the Kimura two parameter model (Kimura, 1980). Phylogenetic tree was inferred using Neighbor-Joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987)."
8,Hydrogen production characteristics,"2.7 Hydrogen production characteristics The above isolate with high hydrogen-producing activity was pre-cultured on basal medium, and then the early-stationary-phase culture was transferred to 140ml serum bottles containing 50ml of basal fermentation media for the following batch tests. The composition of the basal fermentation medium was as follows: 10g raw corn stalk, 3g peptone, 1g yeast extract, 0.5g l-cysteine·HCl·H2O, 10ml nutrient solution (contained 0.1g/l MgSO4·7H2O, 0.01g/l NaCl, 0.01g/l Na2 MoO4·2H2O, 0.01g/l CaCl2·2H2O, 0.015g/l MnSO4·7H2O, 0.00278g/l FeCl2) were dissolved in 1L of KH2PO4–Na2HPO4 buffer (final concentration 0.1M, pH 6.47). These bottles were incubated at 35±1°C in the air-bathing constant-temperature oscillator with a shaking speed of 120rpm to provide better contact among substrates. The biogas volume at regular intervals was measured by releasing the pressure in the bottles using displacement of saturated brine. All the experiments were carried out independently in triplicates. The standard deviation in results was within 5%."
9,Analytical methods,"2.8 Analytical methods The concentration of hydrogen, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols were detected by Gas Chromatograph (GC, Agilent 4890D) as described by Fan and Zhang (2006). Total cellulase activity was determined by the filter paper assay procedure as described by Rattanachomsri et al. (2009). The assay system had a total volume of 2ml, consisting of 1ml of culture supernatant, 1ml of 0.05mol/L citrate acid buffer (pH 5.0) and 50mg of Whatman filter paper No. 1, incubated for 60min at 50°C. The unit of cellulase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1μmol of reducing sugar per 1min. Hydrogen yield was calculated by measurements of the gas composition in the headspace plus the total volume of biogas production at each time interval using the mass equation: (1) V H , i = V H , i - 1 + C H , i ( V G , i - V G , i - 1 ) + V H ( C H , i - C H , i - 1 ) where VH,i and VH , i−1 are the cumulative H2 volumes at the current (i) and previous (i−1) time intervals, respectively; VG,i and VG;i−1 are the total biogas volumes in the current and previous time intervals, respectively; CH,i and CH,i−1 are the fractions of H2 in the headspace in the current and previous time intervals, respectively; VH is the volume of headspace of vials. The degradation rate of substrate was calculated using the following equation: (2) Degradation rate of substrate = CS weight loss(g) Initial CS(g) × 100 %"
10,Kinetic modeling,"2.9 Kinetic modeling The cumulative volume of hydrogen produced in the batch experiments followed the modified Gompertz equation: (3) H = P exp - exp R m e P ( λ - t ) + 1 where H is the cumulative hydrogen production (ml); λ is the lag time (h); P is the hydrogen production potential (ml); Rm is the maximum hydrogen production rate (ml/h) and e is the constant of 2.718281828. The values of P, Rm and λ for each batch were estimated using the solver function in Excel (version 14.0, Microsoft) with a Newtonian algorithm. In this study, Rm is expressed as ml/g-substrate·h−1, the specific hydrogen production potential (Ps) is defined as ml/g-substrate (Fang and Li, 2006)."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Isolation and identification of hydrogen-producing strain,"3.1 Isolation and identification of hydrogen-producing strain A new strain which could directly convert cellulosic biomass (such as MCC) to hydrogen was isolated from the effluent of hydrogen fermentation in an anaerobic bioreactor inoculated with seed microbes (see Section 2.3) and raw corn stalk as feedstock. The bacteria displayed a rod-shape (Fig. S1) with the diameter from 0.7μm to 1.5μm and the length from 2.0μm to 4.5μm. In both the exponential and stationary growth phases, the bacteria exhibited Gram-positive staining. When the environment became unfavorable, the spores could be observed. Other physiological and biochemical properties were summarized in Table S1. The almost complete 16S rDNA gene sequence (1415bp) of strain FZ11 was obtained through comparison analysis using BLAST Search against the GenBank, which revealed that the strain FZ11 exhibited 99% sequence identity with Clostridium sartagoforme and Swine fecal bacterium (Fig. 1 ). The relationship between the strain FZ11 and the most closely taxonomic species based on 16S rDNA sequences was described in the phylogenetic tree of Fig. 1. Based on the morphological and biochemical characteristics analysis, the strain FZ11 was identified as C. sartagoforme FZ11. Furthermore, the 16S rDNA gene sequence of C. sartagoforme FZ11 had been deposited in the GenBank with accession number KJ934704. Clostridium sp. is a familiar species of dominant hydrogen production bacteria, such as C. butyricum, C. beijerinckii and C. acetobutylicum etc. (Puhulwella et al., 2014; An et al., 2014; Avci et al., 2014). Luckily, a new species of hydrogen production strain, namely Clostridium sartagoforme FZ11, was also found in the present work. Experiments showed that when C. sartagoforme FZ11 was added to a selection medium containing MCC, the medium could be liquefied progressively, showing the strain FZ11 had a good potential to directly convert cellulosic biomass to hydrogen."
13,Hydrogen production performance of C. sartagoforme FZ11,"3.2 Hydrogen production performance of C. sartagoforme FZ11 3.2.1 Effect of carbon source In order to investigate the effects of different carbon sources on hydrogen production with FZ11, the following batch tests were arranged under the conditions with carbon source of 10g/l (without pretreatment) and basal fermentation media (pH 7.0). The estimated kinetic parameters for hydrogen production from different carbon sources by FZ11 were summarized in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1, the strain FZ11 was able to utilize various carbon sources to generate hydrogen. Among these carbon sources, the glucose, xylose and cellobiose were complete degradation within 24h and showed the maximum hydrogen yields of 251ml/g, 242.5ml/g, and 235ml/g, respectively. The next one was xylan and hemicellulose, the corresponding hydrogen yields and hydrogen production rate reached to 213.7ml/g, 187.2ml/g and 21.4ml/gh−1, 13.8ml/gh−1, respectively. At the end of fermentation, nearly all the xylan and hemicellulose were used up. Interestingly, both the MCC and CMC could be directly utilized by the strain FZ11 to produce hydrogen without substrate pretreatment under the mesophilic condition, the corresponding hydrogen yield reached to 77.2ml/g and 64.6ml/g, respectively. Meanwhile, the strain FZ11 could degrade 83.2% of MCC and 76.1% of CMC in about 72h. These observations indicated that various types of carbon sources presented in the wastes could be used as feedstock for hydrogen production, which would be of considerable importance in the field of bio-hydrogen evolution by dark fermentation. Despite the fact that the H2 yield from MCC and CMC was not high enough than that of soluble sugar in this stage, the working principle had been illustrated, that is, the strain FZ11 could directly convert cellulosic biomass into bio-hydrogen by dark fermentation without substrate pretreatment. However, the lignin was hardly utilized to produce hydrogen by C. sartagoforme FZ11, showing the complexity of lignin structure. In light of the above findings, the raw corn stalk was used as the sole carbon source, and the influence of initial corn stalk concentration on hydrogen production was further discussed in the range of 5–30g/l at initial pH 7.0, and the result was depicted in Fig. 2 . As shown in Fig. 2, the maximum hydrogen yield increased with an increase in substrate concentration ranging from 56.2ml/g at 5g/l to 70.5ml/g at 15g/l, and then the hydrogen yield slightly decreased with an increase in corn stalk concentration, and only the hydrogen yield of 67.2ml/g at 30g/l-corn stalk was observed. According to the above results, the corn stalk concentration of 15g/l was selected as carbon source in the following batch cultures. 3.2.2 Effect of nitrogen source During hydrogen fermentation process, nitrogen is also an essential component in microbial protein and nucleic acid since it affects the synthesis of enzymes involved in both primary and secondary metabolism. Fig. 3 illustrated the effects of various inorganic and organic nitrogen sources on hydrogen production at the fixed substrate concentration of 15g/l and initial pH 7.0. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the effect of species of nitrogen source on hydrogen production was listed as followed according to the order from the great to the little: beef extract, yeast extract, peptone, urea, NH4HCO3, (NH4)2SO4, NaNO3. The corresponding hydrogen yields (Ps) were 88.6ml/g at beef extract of 2g, 85.5ml/g at yeast extract of 2g, 83ml/g at peptone of 4g, 80.7ml/g at urea of 6g, 70.1ml/g at NH4HCO3 of 8g, 68.7ml/g at (NH4)2SO4 of 4g and 65.3ml/g at NaNO3 of 4g, respectively. The results indicated that the organic nitrogen sources exhibited a higher hydrogen production than the listed several inorganic nitrogen sources. The reason may be that the organic nitrogen sources contained certain growth factors (such as peptides and free amino acids) that could be easily absorbed by microbial cell to improve hydrogen production. However, these growth factors were lacking in inorganic nitrogen sources (Pan et al., 2008; Li and Fang, 2007). Likewise, nitrogen source concentration also significantly affected hydrogen production in the batch tests. For instance, when yeast extract was applied as nitrogen source, the hydrogen yield decreased from the maximal value of 85.5–66ml/g with increasing yeast extract concentration from 2.0g/l to 10.0g/l. Similarly, when the peptone was employed as nitrogen source, the hydrogen yield drastically increased from 65.3ml/g at peptone of 2g/l to maximum 83ml/g with peptone concentration of 4g/l, and then decreased to 72.6ml/g at peptone concentration of 10g/l. This observation suggested that hydrogen production would be inhibited by a higher nitrogen source concentration. But a high hydrogen production was also observed when the urea concentration of 6g/l was used as nitrogen source. Considering the urea was much cheaper than several others. So the urea of 6g/l was used as nitrogen source for the forth coming experiments. 3.2.3 Effect of initial pH Besides above factors, the initial pH value of medium is also a very important factor to affect hydrogen evolution throughout the hydrogen fermentation process. Table 2 presented the effect of initial pH value of medium on hydrogen production in the range from 4.92 to 8.04 at the fixed corn stalk of 15g/l and urea dosage 6g/l. As presented in Table 2, the hydrogen yield (Ps) and hydrogen production rate (Rm ) raised with the increase of initial pH value ranging from 17.5ml/g and 1.4ml/gh−1 at initial pH 4.92 to the maximum value of 82.4ml/g and 6.2ml/gh−1 at initial pH 6.47 separately, and then gradually decreased with the further increase of initial pH value ranging from 81.6ml/g and 5.8ml/gh−1 at pH 6.98 to 28.3ml/g and 2.9ml/gh−1 at pH 8.04. The similar changing trend was also observed for lag time (λ), the shortest lag phase of 6.5h occurred at initial pH 6.47. As soon as the pH value deviated from the optimal level (6.47), the λ value would be prolonged. The change trend resembled that of hydrogen accumulation. e.g., a longer λ of 32h at pH 4.92 and 17h at pH 8.04 was recorded, respectively. The finding was also in agreement with the related research reported in the literature (Zhao et al., 2011), in which the optimal initial pH for hydrogen production usually appeared in the range of 5–7. The results indicated that the reasonable control of medium pH was very significant for improving hydrogen production because the activity of hydrogenase could be inhibited and the corresponding metabolic pathway would be changed by low or high pH values in overall hydrogen fermentation process. 3.2.4 Effect of phosphate buffer concentration As is known to all, hydrogen production is usually accompanied with the formation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohol as metabolic products, which leads to a sharp drop of medium pH. In order to buffer the change of medium pH during hydrogen fermentation, the effect of phosphate buffer concentration on hydrogen production by FZ11 was investigated at the fixed corn stalk 15g/l, urea 6g/l and initial pH 6.47, and the result was depicted in Fig. 4 . As illustrated in Fig. 4, the Ps and Rm increased along with the increase of phosphate buffer concentration from 0M to 0.15M. The Ps of 85.7ml/g and Rm of 6.3ml/gh−1 occurred at the phosphate buffer concentration of 0.15M. After that, the Ps and Rm decreased gradually with increasing phosphate buffer concentration. Meanwhile, the final pH changed from 4.1 to 5.98 with increasing phosphate buffer concentration ranging from 0M to 0.3M. These results showed that phosphate buffer solution could buffer medium pH in a certain range of acidity, and alleviate medium acidification. However, on the other hand, the high content of the phosphate would result in the increase of cytoplasmic osmotic pressure, in that case, the hydrogen production and cell growth would be partially suppressed. 3.2.5 Effect of temperature Operation temperature is another major factor to effect hydrogen production in dark fermentation process because it affects the kinetics of cell growth and enzymatic reaction. Table 3 summarized the changing trend of hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate with fermentation temperature ranging from 15°C to 45°C at the fixed corn stalk 15g/l, urea 6g/l, initial pH 6.47 and phosphate buffer concentration 0.15M. As shown in Table 3, both Ps and Rm increased with the increase of temperature in the range from 15°C to 35°C and then the changing trend was reversed with the increase of fermentation temperature ranging from 35°C to 45°C. The maximum Ps of 87.2ml/g at 35°C and Rm of 6.2ml/gh−1 at 40°C were observed in this run, respectively. The shortest lag time was found at 35°C. These results were in general agreement with the reported work on C. butyricum TM-9A, where the maximum hydrogen production was found at 37°C, however, the developing trend was reversed when the fermentation temperature was above 40°C (Junghare et al., 2012). This may be attributed to the inactivation of some essential enzymes and proteins which associated with cell growth (Junghare et al., 2012), this could lead to the decrease of hydrogen evolution. 3.2.6 Biodegradation characteristics of raw corn stalk by C. sartagoforme FZ11 Basedontheaboveexperiments, the biodegradation characteristics of raw corn stalk by C. sartagoforme FZ11 to produce hydrogen was further examined under the optimal conditions with 15g/l raw corn stalk, 6g/l urea, 0.15M phosphate buffer, initial pH 6.47 and 35°C. The results were illustrated in Fig. 5 . As shown in Fig. 5a, the hydrogen production began after a short lag phase of 6.0h and the hydrogen production rate maintained a high level at 24–37h. The maximal hydrogen yield of 87.2ml/g at 64h and hydrogen production rate of 6.2ml/g·h−1 at 31h were observed, respectively. Then the cumulative hydrogen yield maintained at a nearly invariable level, and the hydrogen production rate decreased so sharply with the increase of incubation time from 2.0ml/g·h−1 at 37h to 0.16ml/g·h−1 at 67h. Meanwhile, the medium pH dropped significantly from initial 6.47 to 5.72 in the first 40h and then kept steady at about 5.47 correspondingly along with hydrogen production and formation of acidic metabolites. We had noticed that the hydrogen yield of raw corn stalk was higher than that of MCC or CMC (a pure cellulose) in the present work. The result could be expected because the strain FZ11 found hemicellulose was more easier to digest than cellulose. Furthermore, the degradation rate of corn stalk rose significantly with the increase of incubation time from 1% at 10h to 41.2% at 64h (Fig. 5b), and then was kept at an almost constant level at 65–70h. The high degradability implied that the substrate was also converted into other metabolic by-products (such as VFAs and alcohol) except for bio-hydrogen. A similar trend in cellulase activity was also found (Fig. 5b), of which the cellulase activity increased rapidly with cultivate time at 0–40h and reached the maximum value of 0.82U/ml after 49h of incubation. These observations also indicated the degradation of cellulose in raw corn stalk by strain FZ11. As is known, hydrogen production was also usually accompanied with the formation of VFAs and alcohol. As described in Fig. 5c, both acetate and butyrate were two main metabolic by-products accounted for about 80% of the total VFAs in the fermentation process, followed by little amounts of ethanol, propionate and butanol. The content of SMP (soluble metabolic by-products, namely total VFAs and alcohol) increased sharply with the cultivate time and reached a top value of 3511mg/l. The biodegradation characteristics of raw corn stalk were also in close agreement with the most of early reports in the literature as to hydrogen production from soluble sugar and crop stalks by hydrogen fermentation, where VFAs and alcohols displayed similar trends (Sontaya and Alissara, 2012; Guo et al., 2014). In addition, the hydrogen production performance of raw corn stalk by C. sartagoforme FZ11 was also compared with several other agricultural wastes by different hydrogenogens, and the result was listed in Table 4 . As illustrated in Table 4, the hydrogen production characteristics of C. sartagoforme FZ11 were better than several other strains. Generally, to convert corn straw waste into bio-hydrogen, the substrate had to be pretreated prior to use and even required thermophilic fermentation except for the individual cases as reported by Song et al. (2014). Only the strain Clostridium sp. FS3 (Song et al., 2014) displayed a slightly higher hydrogen yield for raw corn stalk than the present stain C. sartagoforme FZ11, but it could not directly degrade pure cellulose (such as MCC or CMC) into bio-hydrogen (Song et al., 2014). Compared with the earlier report by Song et al. (2014), a slightly lower hydrogen yield from raw corn stalk in the present work implied that the corn stalk with long storage time served as feedstock that would result in a decline of hydrogen yield by hydrogen fermentation, the reason for this was not clear. In fact, it was difficult to compare hydrogen yield among different fermentation systems because of a great diversity of experimental conditions, including substrate, microbe, temperature and reactor. In spite of this, we may reasonably conclude that C. sartagoforme FZ11 was a more efficient hydrogen producing strain than other several bacteria to directly convert cellulosic biomass into bio-hydrogen without substrate pretreatment, especially raw corn stalk, MCC and CMC, which had special significance in the field of renewable energy."
14,Conclusion,"A new mesophilic anaerobic Bacillus, C. sartagoforme FZ11, had been isolated and identified, which could directly utilize different carbon sources, especially cellulosic materials, to produce hydrogen under the mesophilic condition without substrate pretreatment. The maximum hydrogen yield reached 77.2ml/g for MCC, 64.6ml/g for CMC and 87.2ml/g for raw corn stalk by the strain FZ11 at 35°C under the optimal conditions, respectively. The result illustrated that the present strain FZ11 could be an ideal candidate to directly convert raw cellulosic biomass into bio-hydrogen without substrate pre-treatment."
