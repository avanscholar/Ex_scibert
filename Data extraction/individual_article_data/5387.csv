0,Introduction,"Increasing energy consumption and environment pollution have attracted extensive attentions, such as the diminishment of petroleum reserves and the raise of greenhouse gases. Thus, exploiting renewable and clean energy resources becomes the hottest topic in environment researches [1–3]. Hydrogen, which can be photocatalytically splitted from water successfully pioneered by Fujishima with TiO2 under UV-light irradiation in 1972, has been considered to be an ideal candidate energy resource because it is easy to be obtained from water and harmless for its combustion product [4]. Recently, semiconductor photocatalysis as a new kind of technology has been extensively used in resolving the problems of pollutant and energy shortage [5–9]. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), one of the representatives of carbon-based metal-free nanomaterial, has been studied proverbially by researchers [10–12]. It is viewed worldwide as a photocatalyst with great potential due to its suitable band gap, outstanding chemical stability and wide range solar spectrum response. Even though the g-C3N4 has these excellent virtues, its applicability in water splitting is still restricted by the disadvantages of high electron-hole pairs recombination rate, low specific surface area, poor charge transport property and relatively low solar efficiency [13]. Consequently, exploiting a modification based on g-C3N4 for excellent photocatalytic hydrogen generation is desirable. So far, to achieve highly efficient photocatalysts basing on g-C3N4, a lot of efforts have been devoted to improving the photocatalytic performance, including elemental doping, nonmetal doping, coupling with other semiconductors and so on [10,14–21]. However, the above mentioned strategies have several drawbacks, such as harsh fabrication processes, toxic reagents usage as well as complexity in handling [22]. Recently, it has been reported that vacancy defects in semiconductors play a critical role in boosting the photocatalytic performance [23]. Interestingly, the defects appeared at the heptazines of g-C3N4 seem to be in favor of its photocatalytic processes because the lattice disorders could not only narrow the band-gap by adjusting the conduction band and valence band towards each other simultaneously, but also increase the reactive sites [24,25]. Therefore, developing facile and effective approaches to prepare defect-modified g-C3N4 is an urgent demand. Moreover, the separation efficiency of the photo-excited charge carriers can significantly influence the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4. In general, constructing g-C3N4-based heterojunction with other semiconductors is an effective way because it could induce a built-in electric field and then facilitate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers [26–33]. Nevertheless, since such configurations consist of two distinct semiconductors, the photocatalytic performance is not only affected by their band structure but also influenced by their crystal structure and surface/interface characteristics, which makes it hard to manipulate in optimal working condition. Comparatively, homojunction photocatalysts which are composed by the same semiconductor materials have been considered as an emerging configuration. In homojunction, the difference in positions of Fermi levels could induce band bending near the junction interface, therefore giving rise to a build-in electric field, which not only facilely suppressing the recombination but also facilitating the separation of photogenerated carriers [34]. As we all know that, pure g-C3N4 is a typical n-type semiconductor, while exhibits p-type characteristics when nitrogen vacancies are introduced [35]. So it is possible to construct novel p-n homojunctions by coupling them together, which might be a feasible way to achieve high performance photocatalysts considering the advantages of charge separation and transportation. Here, starting from commercially available peanut oil and dicyandiamide, the nitrogen vacancies were successfully introduced into the conventional g-C3N4 nanosheet framework through N2 annealing and calcination processes, as a result, nitrogen-vacated g-C3N4 p-n homojunction photocatalyst was in situ formed (Fig. 1 ). The characteristics of NV-g-C3N4 were analyzed comprehensively. The results revealed that the g-C3N4 based p-n homojunction nanosheets exhibit significantly enhanced performance in photocatalytic visible-light hydrogen evolution rate, and the possible enhancement mechanism was also proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Dicyandiamide (C2H4N4) and peanut oil were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and ordinary supermarket, respectively. All chemicals were of analytical reagent and used without further purification. Deionized water was used in the entire process of sample synthesis and washing."
3,Preparations of samples,"2.2 Preparations of samples Pristine g-C3N4 nanosheets were fabricated through a two-step calcination using dicyandiamide as the precursor. Firstly, 6 g dicyandiamide was annealed in tube furnace at 525 °C for 2 h under N2. Next, the obtained yellow powder was further calcined at 550 °C for another 6 h with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 in muffle furnace under air atmosphere to obtain pure g-C3N4 nanosheets. Nitrogen-vacated g-C3N4 p-n homojunction nanosheets (named as NV-g-C3N4) were fabricated via hydrothermal-calcination strategy using commercially available peanut oil and dicyandiamide as precursors. Specifically, 1 g of peanut oil and 6 g of dicyandiamide were added to 80 mL deionized water under stirring. Then, the above dispersion was transferred into a stainless steel autoclave with 100 mL Teflon linear and then kept at 110 °C for 10 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction dispersion was poured into a crucible and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The obtained products were annealed at 525 °C with ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 in tube furnace for 2 h under N2 atmosphere. After cooled, gray black powder (denoted as H-g-C3N4) was obtained. Finally, the above gray black H-g-C3N4 powder was further calcined at 550 °C under heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 6 h in muffle furnace under air atmosphere to obtain the NV-g-C3N4. To investigate the role of hydrothermal treatment, another sample (denoted as NV-g-C3N4-1) was prepared by the identical two-step annealing-calcination procedure as described previously using the mixture of 1 g peanut oil and 6 g dicyandiamide as precursors. The physical graphics of the samples are shown in Fig. S1."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The crystallographic and chemical structure of samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker AXS, Germany) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) (Nicolet 5700, USA), respectively. The element binding state of the samples was detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG ESCALAB 220i-XL X-ray sources, UK). The specific surface areas (BET) and total pore volume of the samples were characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (ASAP 2020HD 88, USA). The morphology of sample was studied by transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Tecnai, G20, USA) and atomic force microscope (AFM) (Tap190AI-G, BG). The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded by UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2250, Japan). Electronic states of the samples were investigated by Electron spin spectroscopy (Bruker A300, Germany). The photoluminescence (PL) emission properties of the powders were investigated with fluorescence spectrometer (Perkinelmer, LS55, Germany) and fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Edinburgh, FLSP920, UK)."
5,Evaluation of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"2.4 Evaluation of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was carried out in a closed glass system under 3 W 420 nm LED light illumination and the gases were quantized by a gas chromatograph (SP-7820, China). Typically, 0.02 g photocatalyst powder was dispersed into 100 mL reactor containing 90 mL H2O, 10 mL of sacrificial agent (Triethanolamine) and 1% of H2PtCl6·2H2O (10 mg/mL) [36]."
6,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements The photocurrent and impedance characterization was done to study the photoelectrochemical performance of the as-prepared samples. Firstly, the ITO glass was cleaned by acetone, alcohol and deionized water for 10 min under ultrasonication, followed by drying in oven. Next, 10 mg of the as-prepared sample was dispersed in 2.5 mL absolute ethanol under ultrasonic dispersion for 15 min to obtain a homogeneous suspension. Then, 0.5 mL of the above suspension was ultrasonically mixed with 0.5 mL nafion solution (5%). Finally, the mixture was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO glass at 1000 rpm for 1 min and dried in air [37]. The photoelectrochemical test was accomplished by using a three-electrode system on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Chenhua, China). During the test, 0.5 M Na2SO4 was used as electrolyte solution [38]."
7,DFT study,"2.6 DFT study The first-principles calculations are carried out in Materials Studio (MS). The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange–correlation functional is adopted in the framework of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) parametrization. The K points of 7 × 7 × 1 is chosen for four models. The cutoff energy is set as 400 eV and the vacuum spacing is 15 Å. In addition, the atomic forces and ionic convergence criterions are 0.01 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV."
8,Result and discussion,
9,Physical-chemical characteristics,"3.1 Physical-chemical characteristics The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were employed to investigate the specific surface area and porosity of the as-prepared samples in Fig. 2 . From Fig. 2a, the isotherms of samples are of type IV (BDDT Classification), illustrating the presence of mesopores [39]. Further inspection reveals that the hysteresis loops can be classified as type H3 at a high relative pressure range, which corresponding to the slit-shaped pores [40]. Interestingly, the isotherm of NV-g-C3N4 shows an obviously rapid increase at range of 0.85–1.0 against those of g-C3N4 and H-g-C3N4, indicating the presence of larger numbers of pores [41]. The pore size distribution curves in Fig. 2a further confirm the existence of mesopores in the three samples. Interestingly, all samples exhibit similar bimodal pore size distribution. The small mesopores located at 3–4 nm are attributed to the porosity in the nanoscale layers, while the large mesopores located at 33 nm are due to the pores formed within packed layers. However, the NV-g-C3N4 exhibits obviously higher pore volume in larger pore size range, further confirming the large number of pores. The specific surface area, pore volumes and pore sizes of the samples are summarized in Table 1 . Obviously, the NV-g-C3N4 sample exhibits the largest surface area of 128.0 m2 /g, which is larger than those of g-C3N4 nanosheets (21.6 m2 /g) and H-g-C3N4 (45.5 m2 /g). Generally, larger surface area is believed to provide more active sites, further giving rise to the boosted photocatalytic performance. The TEM (Fig. 2b) and AFM (Fig. 2c and d) were employed to illustrate the microstructure of as-prepared NV-g-C3N4. The TEM images of g-C3N4 and H-g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. S2 of Supporting Information. As shown in Fig. S2, the pure g-C3N4 and H-g-C3N4 are mainly consisted of some thicker sheets. In contrast, as displayed in TEM image of Fig. 2b, the NV-g-C3N4 sample exhibits high transparency with winkled and curved texture, indicating the formation of ultra-thin nanosheets. Further observation from AFM image (Fig. 2c and d) reveals that NV-g-C3N4 has a thickness of about 1.27 nm, which is in good accordance with 3–4 layers stacking of conjugated g-C3N4 [42]. XRD patterns were used to study the crystal structure of the as-prepared photocatalysts. As exhibited in Fig. 2e, two main characteristic peaks at around 13° and 28° can be observed in all samples. In fact, for pure g-C3N4 and H-g-C3N4, the weak characteristic peaks located at 13.1° represent the in-plane structural aligning motifs, which can be indexed as (100) plane. Meanwhile, the strong peaks located at 27.7° represent the interlayer stacking of aromatic systems, which can be assigned to (002) plane [43,44]. Comparatively, it is found that the (100) peak in NV-g-C3N4 is obviously suppressed, suggesting that the introduction of peanut oil decreases the in-plane structural stacking and partially destroys the inner crystal structure in the hydrothermal reaction and successive calcination. Moreover, comparing to g-C3N4 and H-g-C3N4, the (002) peak of NV-g-C3N4 also becomes weaker and shows a slight shift to lower angles from 27.7° to 27.5° (the inset of Fig. 2e), suggesting that the distance in the inter-planar stacking has been increased from 0.321 nm to 0.324 nm [45]. It is believed that the removal of N-containing moieties from g-C3N4 framework will result in lowering in interlayer repulsive force and thus increasing in stacking density [46]. It is well known that the major component of the peanut oil is oleic acid. Therefore, the possible formation process of the NV-g-C3N4 can be described as following steps: (I) The oleic acid of peanut oil and dicyandiamide molecules can be combined by the hydrogen-bond and electrostatic action in the hydrothermal process, in which the oleinic acid-treated dicyandiamide will be formed through the interaction between NH2 in dicyandiamide and COOH in the oleic acid. (II) During the subsequent calcination process, the oleinic acid will be decomposed to release a mass of gases (CO2 and H2O), which can form the strong gas-flow shock to efficiently break the CN bond, resulting in the N defects in the skeleton of NV-g-C3N4 [47]. Raman spectroscopy (DXR Raman spectrometer, Thermo Fisher, USA) is used to analyze the graphitization degree of carbon in the as-obtained samples under the excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Compared with the pure g-C3N4 sample, the H-g-C3N4 and NV-g-C3N4 samples exhibit obviously enhanced peaks from the Fig. S3 of Supporting Information. The peaks at ~614, ~1341 and ~1590 cm−1 were attributed to CNC, defect-induced sp3 carbon (D band) and sp2 carbon (G band) in g-C3N4, respectively [31,48]. Moreover, the relative band intensity ratio ID/IG of g-C3N4, H-g-C3N4 and NV-g-C3N4 were 0.75, 0.87 and 1.07, indicating that the NV-g-C3N4 shows higher structural defects than g-C3N4 and H-g-C3N4 because of the existence of more nitrogen vacancies in NV-g-C3N4 [49]. FT-IR measurements were performed to detect the functional groups in samples. From Fig. 2f, the NV-g-C3N4 and H-g-C3N4 show similar spectra as pure g-C3N4, exhibiting absorption peaks at 810, 1200–1700 and 2800–3400 cm−1 [50]. The peak at 810 cm−1 is ascribed as the bending vibration of s-triazine units, the vibration characteristic detected in the 1200–1700 cm−1 of spectra are attributed to the typical skeletal stretching modes like C(sp2)-N and C(sp2) = N in the CN heterocycles and the broad absorption peak ranging from 2800 to 3400 cm−1 is the stretching identified to the vibrational modes of the NH and OH, respectively [51]. These results further confirm that the as-prepared H-g-C3N4 and NV-g-C3N4 samples are graphic carbon nitrides, which can be prepared from hydrothermal procedure followed by calcination. The chemical composition and valence states of samples are further studied by XPS analysis. As displayed in Fig. 3 a, signals belong to C 1s (~285 eV) and N 1s (~400 eV) can be detected in all samples, which is in good accordance with their elemental composition [52]. However, small peaks of O 1s (~533 eV) are also witnessed for all samples, which can be resulted from the physically adsorbed water [53]. As shown in Fig. 3b, the high-resolution C 1s spectra of samples can be deconvolved into two peaks. One peak located at 284.6 eV is attributed to the adventitious carbon impurities and another peak located at 288.0 eV is ascribed to the sp2 hybrid orbital of NCN bond in the s-triazine ring [54]. Meanwhile, the N 1s spectra of g-C3N4, H-g-C3N4 and NV-g-C3N4 (Fig. 3c) are also constructed by three sub peaks. One peak located at 398.2 eV is attributed to the sp2 N bond (C-NC), the second peak located at 398.9 eV is assigned to the tertiary N bond (N-C3, denoted as N2), and the third peak located at 400.8 eV is ascribed to the surface amino groups (N-HX, denoted as N3) [55]. In addition, it can be observed from the Table 1 that the C/N atomic ratios increase obviously from 0.75 for g-C3N4 to 1.83 for NV-g-C3N4, implying that there exist some nitrogen vacancies in the skeleton of NV-g-C3N4. Furthermore, the results of elemental analysis (elementarvarioPYRO) further verify the trend of decrease in C/N element in the NV-g-C3N4 sample (See Table S1 of Supporting Information). Remarkably, among the above three samples, the ratio of N-C3 increases in NV-g-C3N4 while that of CNC decreases, as presented in Table 2 , indicating that the nitrogen vacancies are originated from the departure of N1. Fig. 3e depicts the molecular structure of g-C3N4. Indeed, from the point of view of structural stability, the most possible site for nitrogen vacancies might exist in N1 position [56]. To further verify the existence of nitrogen vacancies, EPR is employed to detect unpaired electrons in all samples, and the results are plotted in Fig. 3d. In general, the intensity of EPR signal is related to the content of nitrogen vacancies [57]. Apparently, NV-g-C3N4 exhibits much higher EPR signal, indicating the presence of nitrogen vacancies. On the other hand, negligible signal is witnessed in g-C3N4, verifying its good structural regularity [58]. In order to identify the electronic characteristics of g-C3N4, H-g-C3N4 and NV-g-C3N4, the Mott-Schottky analysis is performed, and the results are given in Fig. 4 a and b, respectively. As plotted in Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b, the two curves only show positive slops for g-C3N4 and H-g-C3N4, agreeing well with their typical n-type nature. In contrast, both the positive and negative slopes can be observed in NV-g-C3N4 (Fig. 4c), indicating that the co-existence of both p- and n-type characteristics [35]. Considering the previous results, the p-type characteristics of NV-g-C3N4 must be originated from the nitrogen vacated g-C3N4 domains, while the n-type characteristics is ascribed to ordered g-C3N4 domains. As a consequence, it is expected that p-n homojunction can be in situ formed in NV-g-C3N4 sample through hydrothermal treatment followed by two-step calcination [51]. To obtain a clear view on the p-n homojunction, the energy band construction of NV-g-C3N4 is demonstrated in Fig. 4d. The n-type ordered g-C3N4 domain possesses a band gap (Eg) of 2.84 eV with Fermi level (EF ) closer to the upper conduction band (CB), while the p-type nitrogen vacated g-C3N4 domain has an Eg of 2.6 eV with EF closer to lower valence band (VB). Consequently, p-n homojunction can be established in NV-g-C3N4 by aligning the EF , and thus resulting in band bending as shown in Fig. 4d. Such band bending will induce a built-in electric field pointing from n to p region across the interface, which is benefit to the separation and migration of the photo-excited charge carriers, as demonstrated in Fig. 4e. As a result, boosted structure change from g-C3N4 to NV-g-C3N4 photocatalytic performance can be anticipated."
10,The photoelectrochemical properties,"3.2 The photoelectrochemical properties UV–Vis DRS is employed to investigate the optical properties of samples. It can be seen from Fig. 5 a that, the adsorption edge of H-g-C3N4 and NV-g-C3N4 shows obvious red shift against that of the pristine g-C3N4 sample, indicating that the introduction of oleic acid is in favor of expanding visible-light response in the previous hydrothermal treatment. Further observation suggests that NV-g-C3N4 has a larger red shift than H-g-C3N4, suggesting that the nitrogen vacancies can offer greater potential in expanding visible-light response. Moreover, as shown in the corresponding Tauc plots of Fig. 5b, the Eg of g-C3N4, H-g-C3N4 and NV-g-C3N4 are determined to be 2.84 eV, 2.75 eV and 2.60 eV, respectively [59]. The relatively smaller Eg in NV-g-C3N4 endows it with higher efficiency in solar energy utilization, and therefore an enhancement in photocatalytic activity for the NV-g-C3N4 sample is expected. Fig. 5c shows the PL spectra of samples. Obviously, the NV-g-C3N4 exhibits the lowest PL intensity among these samples upon 370 nm excitation, indicating that the radiative recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is efficiently suppressed in NV-g-C3N4 [60]. Furthermore, the time-resolved PL spectroscopy is used to inspect the charge carrier lifetime of all samples. As shown in Fig. 5d, it is clear that the time-resolved PL spectrum of NV-g-C3N4 shows slower decay kinetics than H-g-C3N4 and g-C3N4, suggesting a longer lifetime in NV-g-C3N4. Through fitting, the lifetime of the samples can be evaluated and the results are listed in Table 3 . Apparently, the average lifetimes of NV-g-C3N4 (6.78 ns) and H-g-C3N4 (6.52 ns) are longer than that of pure g-C3N4 (5.55 ns), indicating stronger carrier transporting capability for NV-g-C3N4 and H-g-C3N4, thus resulting in the faster separation of charge carriers. Therefore, according to the results of PL and the time-resolved fluorescent, it can be inferred that NV-g-C3N4 can provide more photogenerated charges to participate surface photocatalytic redox reactions [61]. Fig. 6 a shows the transient photocurrent response test of the samples under visible light. Apparently, the NV-g-C3N4 sample displays higher photocurrent than those of H-g-C3N4 and g-C3N4, manifesting its higher efficiency in photoinduced carrier’s separation and migration. Meanwhile, the smallest radius of NV-g-C3N4 in the EIS impedance plots (Fig. 6b) indicates the lowest surface resistance and the highest charge transfer efficiency, which is in good accordance with the transient photocurrent response results. The corresponding Nyquist analog equivalent circuit is also given in the inset of Fig. 6b, where R 1, R 2, and CPE are the charge-transfer resistance of the electrolyte solution (0.5 M Na2SO4 in the present case), working electrode and the constant phase element, respectively. Lower value of R 2 represents lower charge-transfer resistance and hence faster transfer rate. After fitting the Nyquist plots, the R 2 values of g-C3N4, H-g-C3N4 and NV- g-C3N4 are determined to be 36, 20 and 12 Ω, respectively. The lowest R 2 value of NV-g-C3N4 suggests that the recombination of photogenerated carriers can be significantly inhibited due to the p-n homojunction structure, and thus resulting in efficient photocatalytic H2 production."
11,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"3.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of samples was evaluated under visible light, and the results are given in Fig. 7 . Not surprisingly, the NV-g-C3N4 displays the optimum activity. The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of samples is presented in Fig. 7a. As shown in Fig. 7a, the NV-g-C3N4 achieves a superior H2 production rate as high as 3259.1 μmol.g−1.h−1 , which is about 8.7 and 3.7 times as high as those of g-C3N4 (374.7 μmol.g−1.h−1) and H-g-C3N4 (874.5 μmol.g−1.h−1), respectively. The poor H2 evolution activity g-C3N4 and H-g-C3N4 can be ascribed to the rapid recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and small surface area. The drastic improvement in H2 evolution performance observed in NV-g-C3N4 can be resulted from a combination of the following effects: (I) The larger specific surface area of NV-g-C3N4 (128.0 m2/g) can provide more activity sites which are benefit to photocatalytic reaction; (II) The narrower bandgap of NV-g-C3N4 (2.60 eV) can extend the light response range, thus enhancing visible light utility; (III) Moreover, it is most important that the formation of in situ p-n homojunction in NV-g-C3N4 facilitates photogenerated carrier separation and transfer, further improving the photocatalytic performance. To further verifies the function of hydrothermal treatment in NV-g-C3N4 fabrication, another sample (denoted as NV-g-C3N4-1) was prepared by the identical two-step annealing-calcination procedure using the mixture of 1 g peanut oil and 6 g dicyandiamide as precursors. As expected, when compared to NV-g-C3N4, the H2 production rate of NV-g-C3N4-1 is significantly inferior by a factor of about 2.3. The above results confirm that the hydrothermal treatment is helpful for achieving outstanding performance of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. During the hydrothermal treatment, as discussed previously, molecules of different precursors can be connected through hydrogen bond interactions and the electrostatic action, which is in favor of the reaction between dicyandiamide and peanut oil, as a result introducing more nitrogen vacancies into NV-g-C3N4. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance comparison of the NV-g-C3N4 sample against the reported photocatalysts in the literatures is shown in Table 4 , indicating the excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution activity for NV-g-C3N4. To estimate the stability of photocatalyst, a four-cycle recycling was conducted on NV-g-C3N4. As shown in Fig. 7b, no obvious declining in H2 production rate was observed after four cycles, suggesting that the excellent stability of the NV-g-C3N4. At the same time, as shown in Fig. 7c, similar FT-IR spectra of NV-g-C3N4 before and after photocatalytic reaction further prove the outstanding stability of our samples, which is critical for large scale application in industry. Additionally, theory calculations were revealed to explore the nitrogen-vacancy in NV-g-C3N4. The nitrogen sites in NV-g-C3N4 have three different possibilities, as showed in Fig. 8 . In order to determine which N site could be, the total energies were calculated by material studio. As shown in Fig. 8, the total energy difference between g-C3N4 and NV-g-C3N4 at site 1 to 3 is calculated to be −0.408, 0.408 and 2.584 eV, respectively. The above results indicate that the substitution at site 1 is preferable, which is consistent with previous results [56]."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, we successfully fabricated in situ g-C3N4 p-n homojunction with abundant nitrogen vacancies via hydrothermal treatment followed by two-step calcination. As expected, the NV-g-C3N4 sample exhibited an excellent enhancement for photocatalytic H2 production rate, which is 8.7 times as high as the g-C3N4. Further study indicates that the accelerated photocatalytic H2 production rate of the NV-g-C3N4 is due to the large specific surface area, boarder solar spectrum utility, as well as high-speed separation of photoinduced carriers originated from the p-n homojunction. This work paves a new way for designing novel photocatalysts based g-C3N4 for highly efficient water splitting."
