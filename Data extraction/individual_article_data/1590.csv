0,Introduction,"Furfuryl alcohol (FOL) is an important intermediate for the production of lysine, ascorbic, drugs, and various lubricants, which also deserves attention as a potential platform for biofuels to take place of the fossil fuels [1–3]. The industrial method of producing FOL is hydrogenation of furfural (FAL), which can be obtained from the lignocellulosic biomass by catalytic dehydration [4], by the catalysts of copper chromate [5]. However, many factors including partial size, reaction temperature and pressure of H2 influence the activity and selectivity of catalysts [6,7]. Therefore, accomplishing chemical selectivity is considerably challenging for hydrogenation of all CO and CC unsaturated bonds of furfural, which may respectively lead to tetrahydrofurfural or tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. In addition, the poisonous Cr2O3 is a serious contaminant, which promotes the investigators to develop other metals to take the place of Cr. Recently, abundant of supported bimetallic (CuNi [8], PdFe [9]), precious metal (Ru [10], and Pd [11]) or metallic oxide (Co3O4 [12]) catalysts were reported for the gas phase, liquid phase hydrogenation with H2 or transfer hydrogenation [13]. Nevertheless, most synthesis methods of the catalysts are complicated and the use of noble metals can increase the expenditure. Hence, it's essential that project and compound of efficient catalysts with high selectivity, activity and low cost. Co, a cheap and high activity non-noble metal, has been loaded on SBA-15 [14], TiO2 [15] and carbonaceous materials [16], which were studied in selective hydrogenation of FAL. It is found that the Co is low active at low temperature and low selective at high temperature. Hence, Co based catalysts with excellent activity and selectivity are still necessary. And the Nitrogen-doped carbon materials have advantages of high surface area, facile and have involved broad investigation as catalysts carriers during the past several years. In this work, Co nanoparticles were supported on nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials (CPNs) by one-pot method, and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) etc. This study affords the encouraging potential application of Co@CPNs catalysts in the selective hydrogenation reactions. Compared with noble metal catalysts, such as Au/Al2O3 [17], Pt/MgO [18], Co@CPNs possesses non-poisonous peculiarity, simple synthesis method and low price. Co/CPNs also exhibits superiority on conversion and selectivity (both 99%) compared with the non-noble metal catalysts Fe-Cu/γAl2O3 catalyst with 93% furfural conversion and 98% selectivity to furfuryl alcohol [19] and Fe-promoted Cu/SiO2 maintains 95% conversion and 87% selectivity to FOL [20]."
1,Experimental section,
2,Reagents and chemicals,"2.1 Reagents and chemicals All reagents and chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without any further purification. Cobalt (II) nitrate hexhydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.0%) was purchased from Shanghai Zhongqin Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd. Sodium chloride (NaCl, 99.5%) was purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd. Melamine (C3N3(NH2)3) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd. Chitosan was purchased from Reagents Co., Ltd."
3,Synthesis of the catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of the catalysts 1.5 g Chitosan, 1.5 g Melamine, 1.0 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and 4.0 g NaCl were thoroughly mixed, and the resulting mixture were transferred into a porcelain boat and heated up to 500 °C in 220 min, then it was kept at 500 °C for 60 min. Then, the mixture was heated up to desired temperature at a rate of 3.75 °C/min and was hold for 60 min under the nitrogen atmosphere. After the temperature cooled down to room temperature, the mixture was washed by 200 mL deionized water in the ultrasonic irradiation to promote the dissolve of NaCl and in Fig. S2c were not found the elements of Cl and Na, this phenomenon provide the NaCl was remove clearly. Finally, the mixture were filtrated and dried at 60 °C for 12 h and got the Co@CPNs catalysts. The schematic caption of the synthesis of catalysts were shown in Fig. 1 ."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Characterizations of the catalysts,"3.1 Characterizations of the catalysts The ingredient and morphology of the catalysts are displayed in Fig. S2 with TEM and SEM. Fig. S2a presents that the Co nanoparticles were well-proportioned dispersed on the CNPs. Fig. S2b show that the average sizes of Co nanoparticles is about 31.2 nm. Fig. S2c was the EDX of the catalysts, which shows that the catalysts have the elements of C, N, O and Co. HR-TEM (Fig. S2d) shows that the lattice distance is 0.209 nm, which can be assigned to the (111) planes of metallic Co. Fig. S2e is the result of mapping zone and the results are presented in Fig. S2f. In Fig. S2f, the green zone is the mapping of cobalt, and the other two yellow and red zones are the N and C, respectively. It is obvious that the zone of elements of C, N was mostly overlap, and the element of Co is inserted into the other two elements. And from Fig. S1, It could be obverted that the cobalt was observed with a thin layer of carbon and the thickness of the carbon is about 1.89 nm [21]. The patterns of XRD were displayed in Fig. S3a, which could provide the composition of catalysts. The two peaks of 2θ = 26.0° and 44.0° were corresponding to (002) and (101) planes of carbon (JCPDS 75-1621) [22]. In addition, It can be found that the (101) peak of carbon is the same as the (111) peak of cobalt. The peaks located at 2θ = 44.0°, 51.5°, and 75.8° were corresponding to the Co lattice planes of (111), (200) and (220) (JCPDS 1–1255) [23]. Therefore, the cobalt existed in the Co@CPNs-1.5-1.5-4 with state of Co0, which fitted in with the result of TEM. The XPS were displayed in Fig. S3b–f, which provided the chemical elements valence states and molar fraction of Co (7.83%), C (74.63%), N (1.58%), and O (15.96%) on the surface of the catalysts, and all the binding energys from the XPS analysis were calibrated by using the C1s peak at 284.6 eV. Fig. S3b shows the wide survey spectrum of the Co@CPNs, and the peaks at the binding energies of 285.2 eV, 399.8 eV, 531.3 eV and 780.3 eV were attributed to the C 1 s, N 1 s, O 1 s, and Co 2p species, respectively [24]. From the high-resolusion spectrum it can be observed that the C 1 s (Fig. S3c) peak components with binding energys at 286.6 eV, 285.0 eV and 284.3 eV were related to the CO, CC, and CN, respectively [25,26]. The N 1 s spectrum (Fig. S3d) was deconvoluted into two peaks that corresponding to the following functional groups: 401.1 eV for CN and 399.1 eV for CN [27,28]. There were three signals observed of O 1 s (Fig. S3e) (532.8 eV for C-O-C, 531.4 eV for CoO and 530.1 eV for CO) [29,30]. Co 2p (Fig. S3f) was spilt into Co 2p3/2 at 778.3 eV and Co 2p1/2 at 793.2 eV, these two peaks stand for metal of cobalt and the results was corresponded to the results of the XRD [31]. The binding energys of oxidised Co of 2p3/2 was located at 781.7 eV and the 2p1/2 was located at 803.6 eV [32,33]. There are two reasons of having peaks of oxidised cobalt, one was that the suffice of cobalts have a little oxidation when the catalysts were exposured to air and the other was that the oxygen in the chitosan have a reaction with the cobalt at high tempeture. However, from the image of XRD, there were not the peaks of cobaltous oxide, this phenomenon may be caused by the lattice of oxidised cobalt was amorphous and these species were not detected by XRD."
6,Performance of catalysts,"3.2 Performance of catalysts The performance of catalysts were tested by selective hydrogenation of FAL to FOL (Table 1 ). All the types of the catalysts were tested at 3 MPa of H2, 453 k for 2.5 h, and the iPrOH as solvent. Starting to stirring when the temperature reached to 453 k. From Table 1, It could see that the catalyst perform the highest activity when the mass of chitosan and melamine were both 1.5 g, the mass of NaCl was 4.0 g, and the temperature of calcination was 1073 k. From Table 1, the mass of NaCl influence the surface area of the catalysts was very obviously and the influence of the reaction activity was also distinct. It was deduced that the NaCl was influencing the surface area of the catalysts, which can increase the exposure of the center of activity of catalysts. It also tested the activity of catalysts (Table 1 Entry 3) in different solvent and the results were shown in Table 2 . From the results, it can be got that the catalysts have a good activity when the solvent have hydroxyl and high polarity. When the solvent was the water there have a low conversion, this may be the substrate could not dissolve in the water and the substrate could not exposure adequately with H2·When the solvent was methyl alcohol, the catalysts behaved high activity, however, the selective was not very well, the reaction produced too much byproducts The main reaction of the generation of byproducts were that the methyl alcohol and FAL have an aldol condensation reaction and the mechanism was shown in Fig. S7 [34]. Considering the rate of reaction and the yield of objective product, the iPrOH was chose as the final solvent. We also test the final solvent with GC–MS, there was no acetone founded, it could dope out that the hydrogen donors was H2 but not the iPrOH. From Table 3 , it could see that at high temperature the catalysts have a well activity and the best reaction temperature was 453 k. At the lower temperature, the higher yield can be get through the increase the reaction time (entry 2 and 4). From the entry 7–9, we found that the conversion will increase with the increase the pressure of H2 and when the pressure was 3 MPa, the conversion achieve the highest. Finally, the selective hydrogenation of various α, β-unsaturated carbonyl or ketone was also tested with the catalysts, and the results were shown in Table 4 . From Table 4 we can see that the catalysts also behave high activity and selectivity with other compounds except the acid, this may be the carboxyl was too stable. So as to test the ability of the circulation of catalysts, selective hydrogen of FAL was performed at 453 k, 3 MPa of H2 for 2.5 h. The used catalysts were washed by iPrOH for five times for the next cycle, and the results were shown in Table 5 . After four times cycling, the activity and the selectivity of the catalysts were not changed apparently, this result suggested that the cycling ability of catalysts were favorable. We also analyzed the catalysts after the recycle by ICP and the mass content of cobalt was 17.29%, which was less about 3% than the fresh catalysts. The loss of the cobalt in the reaction may result the decline of the conversion."
7,Conclusion,"In this study, Co nanoparticles were supported on nitrogen-doped carbon porous materials (CPNs) by single pot method and utilized to selective hydrogenation of the FAL to FOL. After the screening of the reaction condition, satisfactory conversion and selectivity were obtained. Co@CPNs-1.5-1.5-4 exhibited best catalysts activity among all types of the catalysts, which performs the high activity, conversion (99%) and selectivity (99%) of FAL to FOL. Avoiding the noble metal shortcoming of the high cost and the non-noble metal weakness of low catalytic activity. This study demonstrated the high catalytic activity Co@CPNs-1.5-1.5-4 were prepared in the selective hydrogenation of FAL to FOL."
