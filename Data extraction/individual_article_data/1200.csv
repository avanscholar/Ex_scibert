0,Introduction,"Biomass has been considered as a renewable source of energy, which can be used directly via combustion for supplying heat or energy. Biomass also can be converted into liquid fuel via pyrolysis, a thermo-chemical process to break down the macro-polymer structure in biomass to form the condensable liquid named as bio-oil, the solid products named as bio-char and the gaseous products [1–3]. The gases formed from the pyrolysis are combustible and can be used to provide the energy required for the endothermic pyrolysis process [4]. Pyrolysis of biomass involves a very complicated reaction network as both the primary decomposition of the macro structure of biomass and the secondary decomposition/condensation of the primary products took place [5,6]. Understanding the mechanism of pyrolysis of biomass has been the focus of many studies [7–13]. The reaction network in the pyrolysis of process is affected by many factors such as atmosphere of the pyrolysis, the heating temperature, the heat transfer efficiency, the mass transfer (the particle size of feedstock), the reactor type, etc [1]. The reaction atmosphere of pyrolysis can remarkably change the chemistry of the pyrolysis reactions, as indicated in previous studies [14–18]. Generally, nitrogen, argon and helium were regarded as the inert atmospheres for biomass pyrolysis as they generally do not react with the reaction intermediates generated in pyrolysis [19–21]. Other atmospheres such as carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen and steam were also used as the reaction atmosphere of pyrolysis [14–18]. These gases were generally regarded as reactive, which could interfere with primary and secondary pyrolysis reactions and hence modified the distribution and properties of the products [14–18]. Thus, several research groups have investigated the use of the reactive atmospheres to study the possibility of controlling the occurrences of the secondary reactions to obtain the bio-oil with the improved properties [22]. For example, Ragucci et al. investigated the influence of the steam atmosphere in the slow pyrolysis of cellulose [22]. Their results showed that steam could positively improve the gas yield and carbon monoxide content. In addition, bio-char properties such as surface area were also improved [22]. Antal et al. developed the kinetics for the pyrolysis of the cellulose in nitrogen and steam [23]. Their results indicated that the presence of the steam in the pyrolysis medium did not have a considerable influence on pyrolysis kinetics of cellulose [23]. Shen et al. investigated the thermal decomposition of cellulose at different atmospheres by using TG-MS analyser [24]. They selected helium and oxidative (helium with 7% O2, 20% O2 and 60% O2) atmospheres in their study. Their results confirmed that the evolution reactions of the volatiles such as furfural, acetone, 2,5-hydromethyl furfural, formaldehyde, CO and CO2 were considerably affected by increasing the oxygen content in the atmosphere [24]. The reactive atmosphere clearly affected either the primary pyrolysis or secondary conversion of the volatiles via decomposition or condensation reactions that leads to the formation of gases, light and heavy compounds in bio-oil and also bio-char [25,26]. Tailoring the primary and secondary reactions via adjusting the reaction atmosphere could thus modify the pyrolysis process [25,26]. In addition to the gases and steam, organic compounds could also be potentially used to interfere with the primary pyrolysis or secondary conversion of the volatiles. It has been demonstrated that the volatiles (the organic compounds) generated from the primary pyrolysis are reactive at the high temperatures [27–31]. Thus, the externally added organics could also potentially affect the pyrolysis of biomass, tailoring the distribution of the main products. In this study, the effects of externally added ethanol and glycol on the pyrolysis of cellulose were investigated. The rationale for using ethanol is because that ethanol could be produced from biomass via fermentation [32], while glycol could be produced from biomass via hydrolysis and hydrogenation [33]. These alcohols contain the hydroxyl group. At the typical pyrolysis temperature (i.e. 400-600 °C), they might decompose or degrade to form the oxygen-containing reaction intermediates that might further react with the volatiles generated from the pyrolysis and thus modify the distribution of the products. Cellulose was selected as the reaction substrate as it is one of the most abundant components in biomass [34]. It has to note that the cost of such a process with co-feeding the alcohols was not considered, as this study was a proof of concept for demonstrating the effects of alcohols on the pyrolysis behaviours of cellulose. The results indicated that the presence of the alcohols in the atmosphere of the pyrolysis remarkably affected both the primary pyrolysis and secondary conversion of the volatiles via decomposition or condensation reactions, resulting in the formation of the bio-char with the distinct properties and the distribution of the products in the bio-oil and the gases generated."
1,Experimental methodology,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All the chemicals used were analytical grade. Ethanol and glycol were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The other used chemicals including cellulose, phenol, 1,6-anhydro-b-d-glucopyranose (levoglucosan), furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Prior to the pyrolysis reaction, the cellulose was heated to 105 °C for 8 h to remove the moisture."
3,Pyrolysis experiments,"2.2 Pyrolysis experiments A fixed-bed reactor was used for the cellulose pyrolysis. Nitrogen was selected as the carrier gas and its flow rate was set to 140 mL/min. The pyrolysis experiments were carried out at 400 °C or 600 °C, which will be indicated in the text. To perform the experiment, the quartz boat filled with 2 g of cellulose was fed into the fixed-bed reactor instantly when the pyrolysis temperature reached the setting value. At the same time, the solution (ethanol or glycol) was pumped with the flow rate 0.1 mL/min into the reactor. The pyrolysis of the cellulose with feeding the alcohols was hold for 30 min for completion of the pyrolysis process. After the experiment, the pumping of the alcohol was stopped and the reactor was cooled to room temperature. To collect the volatiles produced, a set of four gas-liquid separators connected in series and immersed in the ice water was used. Inside each separator, there was 15 mL of the mixed solution of chloroform and methanol with the volumetric ratio of 4 : 1 to trap the light volatile compounds from the gas flow. The aim of using 4 separator was to ensure that all the condensable volatiles could be trapped inside the cold solvent. The combination of cold methanol and chloroform was to enhance the efficiency of the separation process of the condensable and non-condensable volatiles from each other. The tail gas after the separators was connected to gas detectors to analyse the incondensable gaseous products. The dissolved volatiles inside the solution of the chloroform and methanol was considered as bio-oil. The weight increase of the solution after the experiment was considered as bio-oil. It should be noted the possible evaporated solution during the experiment was recovered by collecting the all produced gas in a bag. The weight difference of the all flowed inert gas and collected gas was considered as the evaporated solvent. Additionally, bio-oil includes light and heavy (tar) fractions, which required to be separated from the solvent. To measure the yield of tar, the heavy fraction of the bio-oil, the mixture of bio-oil and chloroform/methanol was placed in an oven with blast air flow set at 35 °C for 4 h. The remained liquid, which was the heavy part of the bio-oil and was defined as tar. By the decrease of the weight of tar from bio-oil, the weight of light fraction was calculated. To minimize the experiment error, the tar yield was measured three times to achieve the error within ±1%. The procedures for the details could refer to our previous studies [4]."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods 2.3.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) To characterize the crystal structure of the bio-char, Rigaku Ultima IV X–ray was used. By using the Cu, K ɑ radiation source, the samples were analysed from 10 to 80° at the scanning rate of 10°/min. 2.3.2 GC-MS analysis The volatile products in the bio-oil were analysed by using a Shimadzu GC-MS (GC-MSQP2020). The instrument fitted with a capillary column with 30 m in length and 0.25 mm in internal diameter was used for separation of the organics. For the analysis, 0.5 μL of the sample was injected into the inlet of injector that was set at 250 °C with a split ratio of 50 : 1. The temperature of the GC oven was enhanced from 40 to 250 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min and maintained at that temperature for 5 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas and its flow rate was set at 4.0 mL/min. The standard spectra in the NIST 2014 library was used to identify the compounds present in bio-oil. For some compounds with the standard chemical available, the concentration in the samples was quantified with external method. Determination of carbohydrates in the bio-oil was performed in high performance liquid chromatography (LC-20AD/T LPGE; Column: SUGAR SH1011) instrument. 2.3.3 UV-fluorescence spectroscopy A fluorescence spectrometer (Shimadzu, RF-6000) was used to analyse the relative abundance of the aromatic compounds with the fused-ring structures. Methanol was selected as the solvent to dilute sample to 500 ppm for the analysis. The details can refer to our previous studies [35]. 2.3.4 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) Volatilities from the tar and thermal stability of the bio-char were analysed by TGA (Henven, HCT-1). For the analysis, the temperature initially was set at room temperature for 10 min to flush the residual air inside with a flow of high-purity nitrogen (20 mL/min). The samples were heated to 100 °C and maintained for another 10 min to removal the absorbed moisture. The temperature was then increased to 900 °C with a heating rate 10 °C/min in nitrogen atmosphere. A mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer MS GSD 320) was also connected to the outlet of the TG to analyse the exhausting gas (CO, CO2, H2, C2H4 and CH4). 2.3.5 Elemental analysis (EA) The abundance of the elements (C, N, S and H) in the tar and bio-char samples was measured by using a EuroEA3000-Single instrument analyser. In each analysis, ca. 1–2 mg of the sample (precisely weighted) was combusted at 950 °C in an oxygen flow (100 mL/min). A column was installed after the combustion reactor to separate the gaseous compounds. The signals of the gases were measured by a TCD. 2.3.6 Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transforms spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and FT-IR To evaluate the thermal stabilities of the functional groups in the bio-char samples, Nicolet IS50 instrument equipped with a DRIFT cell (modified Harrick Praying Mantis) was used. Each time 0.2 g of the samples was loaded and heated to 700 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min in vacuum. The absorption spectra were recorded constantly with a MCT detector cooled in liquid nitrogen. The same instrument also recorded the FT-IR spectra of the tar and bio-char samples. KBr (ca. 100 mg) was used to dilute the samples, which were scanned for 20 times with the spectra resolution of 0.9 cm−1. 2.3.7 FT-Raman spectroscopy The Bio-char samples produced under different conditions were analysed by Raman technique (Horiba Labram HR Evolution spectrometer). Prior to the analysis, the samples were diluted with KBr to 1 wt% and ground uniformly. After that, the sample was dried at 105 °C for 5 h. Finally, the sample was pressed at 10 MPa for 1 min for the analysis."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Yields of bio-char and tar,"3.1 Yields of bio-char and tar Fig. 1 shows the yields of the tar and bio-char produced from the pyrolysis of cellulose at 400 and 600 °C, respectively in the different reaction atmospheres (with co-feeding ethanol, glycol and blank). At the pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C, the most striking feature for the pyrolysis of the cellulose was the much higher yield of the bio-char produced with co-feeding glycol. The pyrolysis of single glycol at 400 and 600 °C was also performed and the results showed that no much light organics were formed (Figure S1 in Supporting Information). However, the pyrolysis of single ethanol or single glycol also produced the organics with the π-conjugated structures. The derivatives from pyrolysis of ethanol or glycol also could be polymerized. The glycol fed in probably reacted with the organic components on surface of the bio-char, and cross-polymerized, leading to the remarkable increase of the yield of bio-char at 400 °C. However, at the pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C, such an effect was not observed. The cracking or pyrolysis reactions dominated, while the cross-polymerisation reactions between the glycol with bio-char became insignificant. The co-feeding with ethanol, however, even decreased the yield of bio-char produced at both 400 and 600 °C. For the tar produced, the presence of ethanol showed no remarkable effects at 400 °C, but could obviously increase the yield of tar, the heavy fraction of bio-oil, at 600 °C. The ethanol-derived intermediate products reacted with the volatile generated from cellulose and formed more heavy components. Similar phenomenon was observed for the tar generated with the co-feeding of glycol."
7,Gas analysis,"3.2 Gas analysis The intensity of the gas components produced during the pyrolysis experiments were recorded by infrared gas detectors and the results were presented in Fig. 2 . CO and CH4 had relatively high abundance in the tail gas, while the amounts of CO2 and H2 produced were small. CO and CH4 were produced from the cracking of the C–C, C–H and C–O bonds in the cellulose structure through to the free radicals reactions [35]. However, hydrogen and oxygen free radicals might not have enough time to evaluate to form H2 and CO2 [4,35]. At 400 °C for the blank experiment without feeding of ethanol or glycol, from the initial stages (after 200 s), the signals for CO and CH4 were recorded. Their intensity increased rapidly at 360 s and then decreased after 720 s. The intensity of CO signal became zero, while the signal for CH4 production spanned in a longer period of time. The CO production was ascribed to decarbonylation reaction of the aldehydes or ketones produced from the cellulose cracking [35,36], while CH4 might be obtained from the cracking of –CH2OH in the cellulose structure and/or from the secondary reactions of volatiles [36]. The increase of the pyrolysis temperature to 600 °C enhanced the signal intensity for the production of CO and CH4, due to the increasing cracking reactions rates. By co-feeding ethanol at 400 °C, almost no noticeable change for distribution of the gases was seen. In comparison, at 600 °C, the CO peak shifted to 900 s and continued to decline up to the end of experiment. In addition, the formation of CH4 showed a two-steps trend including a peak centred at 360 s and the second peak centred at 1080 s. This confirmed the interference of ethanol on the evolution of the gaseous products during the pyrolysis of cellulose. With the co-feeding of glycol at 400 °C, the signals for CO and CH4 production decreased considerably, while higher yields of bio-char and tar were obtained (Fig. 1), further confirming the cross-polymerisation between glycol or the glycol-derived intermediates with bio-char and the volatiles generated. Interestingly, by the increase of the pyrolysis temperature to 600 °C, more CH4 was produced, originating from the enhanced cracking of the –CH2OH group in cellulose. The integrated abundance of the gaseous products including H2, CH4, CO2 and CO were reported in Fig. 3 . At 400 °C, the blank experiment resulted in the highest abundance of the gases, while the ethanol or glycol co-fed in interfered with the formation of the gaseous products. The alcohols might trapped some of the radicals generated, retaining these radicals in bio-char or tar. The increase of the pyrolysis temperature to 600 °C substantially promoted the formation of the gaseous products. It is worth mentioning that no gaseous produced was detected in the model compound experiment during the pyrolysis of glycol and ethanol. The interaction of ethanol or glycol with the reaction intermediates from pyrolysis of cellulose affected the evolution of the gaseous products. The presence of ethanol or glycol also significantly affected the formation of the organics in bio-oil, which was subsequently investigated."
8,Bio-oil analysis,"3.3 Bio-oil analysis 3.3.1 Characterization of the organics in bio-oil The concentration and abundance of the typical light compounds present in the bio-oil were measured by using GC-MS and HPLC and the normalized abundance were shown in Fig. 4 with the quantified results shown in Table S1 and S2. The co-feeding of the alcohols significantly influenced the composition of the bio-oil. At 400 °C, acetic acid was produced via cracking of cellulose structure, production of which was enhanced with co-feeding glycol while not with ethanol. In addition, the co-feeding with the alcohols could remarkably promote the formation of furfural and glycolaldehyde at the pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C, especially for glycol. The derivatives from glycol facilitate the dehydration of the sugar substrate to form the furans or the decomposition of the sugar substrate via the retro-aldol-condensation reactions. At 600 °C, the same phenomenon was observed. In addition, for the dehydrated sugars, the formation of 1,4:3,6-dianhydro-α-d-glucopyranose, produced via the breakage of β(1 → 4)-glycosidic bonds in cellulose and then by dehydration [37–39], was promoted by co-feeding of the alcohols, while the formation of other sugars such as 1,6-anhydro-b-d-glucopyranose (levoglucosan) was not affected much by the presence or absence of the alcohols. In addition, the alcohols did not affect the formation of the mono-phenols, such as phenol. The above results clearly indicated the presence of alcohols could remarkably affect the evolution of organics during the pyrolysis of cellulose, originating from their complex radical reactions. Since the heavy fraction of the organics in bio-oil could not be detected with GC-MS or HPLC, the UV–fluorescence spectroscopies for characterization of the ring structures of the organics were further conducted. 3.3.2 UV–fluorescence spectroscopy Fig. 5 shows the fluorescence spectra of the bio-oils produced at 400 and 600 °C in the different reaction atmospheres. At 400 °C, the fluorescence spectra of the tar located in the range from 270 to ca. 375 nm, which mainly signaled the presence of aromatics with 1–3 benzene rings [8]. The co-feeding of ethanol or glycol all could enhance the formation of the components with the conjugated ring structures. This was more obvious with the increase of the pyrolysis temperature to 600 °C. As shown in Fig. 5h, the fluorescence intensities for the bio-oils produced with the co-feeding of ethanol or glycol were remarkably higher than that in absence of the alcohols. In addition, the 3d-UV fluorescence results (Fig. 5a–f) also showed that the intensity of IV region was higher after co-feeding of ethanol or glycol, illustrating that the polymer with the conjugated structure of benzene ring and furan ring was generated after co-feeding. Furthermore, at the pyrolysis temperature in 600 °C, the fluorescence peaks were moved to the V region, which indicates that a further increase in the degree of polymerisation. The GC-MS results (Fig. 4) indicated that the presence of the alcohols could promote the formation of the aldehydes and furans that were the precursors for formation of the aromatics [40]. This would explain the promotional effects of the alcohols on evolution of the aromatics during the pyrolysis of cellulose at especially the higher temperature of 600 °C."
9,Analysis of tar,"3.4 Analysis of tar The C, H, O contents of the tars obtained from the pyrolysis under the different conditions were shown in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. Additionally, the mass balance for the elements of tar is shown in Table S3. The presence of glycol in the tar led to the lower carbon content while correspondingly the higher content of oxygen in the tar. Compared to cellulose feedstock, in the tar produced in the blank experiment or with the co-feeding of ethanol, the carbon content was enhanced from 40.9 to 48.7 and 48.9 wt%, respectively. The formation of these heavy components in the tar was accompanied with the removal of oxygen via the dehydration, etc [4,35]. Nevertheless, the C/H ratio at the pyrolysis temperature of 400 or 600 °C did not decrease remarkably, indicating that the dehydration reactions, which led to the increase of C/H ratio, was probably not the dominant reaction routes. The co-feeding of ethanol did not change much of the elemental composition of tar. The tar samples were further analysed with FT-IR and the spectra were shown in Fig. 6 . The absorption peak at ca. 3400, 2900, 1700, 1100 and 750 cm−1 were observed. The absorption peak at 3400 cm−1 was attributed to –OH functional group, which is possibly due to the presence of alcohols, acids or water in the tar [36,41]. The centred peak at 2900 cm−1 was probably related to the alkenes (C–H) [36,41], which had a considerable intensity with co-feeding glycol. The stretching vibration peak at 1700 cm−1 showed the presence of the carbonyl functionalities in the tar, while that at ca. 1700 cm−1 attributed to the presence of olefins [38]. The broad peak at ca. 1100 cm−1 for all the tars produced at 400 °C could be related to the presence of esters or ethers [36,41]. Aromatics in the tar produced in the glycol atmosphere resulted in the presence of the peak centred at 750 cm−1 [36,41]. The presence of the residual glycol interfered with the absorption spectra of the tar. The co-feeding with ethanol, however, showed the negligible impact on distribution of the functionalities in the tar."
10,Bio-char characterization,"3.5 Bio-char characterization 3.5.1 Bio-char elemental analysis Tables 3 and 4 shows the results for the elemental analysis of the bio-chars produced in the different reaction atmospheres. Moreover, in Table S3 the mass balance of the elements is shown. At the pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C, the co-feeding of alcohols significantly affected elemental composition of the char, especially for that produced with co-feeding glycol. The carbon content in the bio-chars from co-feeding glycol was considerably lower than that from the blank experiment. The yield of bio-char with the co-feeding of glycol was significantly higher than that in the blank experiment (Fig. 1). The lower carbon content while the higher oxygen content herein clearly indicated that the cross-polymerisation reactions between glycol or the glycol-derivatives and the organic components in the bio-char took place, enhancing the yield of bio-char. The effect of co-feeding with ethanol also showed the impact on elemental composition of the bio-char. The carbon content was higher while the oxygen content was lower in the bio-char produced with co-feeding ethanol than in that produced from the blank experiment. The presence of ethanol could clearly aid the removal of oxygen-containing species, leading to the bio-char with the higher contents of hydrogen and carbon. The co-feeding of glycol led to the bio-char more oxygen-rich, whether at the pyrolysis temperature of 400 or 600 °C. 3.5.2 FT-IR analysis The FT-IR spectra for the bio-char produced at the different conditions are shown in Fig. 7 . For the bio-char produced at 400 °C, generally the absorption of the hydroxyl group at 3450 cm−1, the C–H bonds 2900 cm−1, the CO functionality at 1700 cm−1, the CC functional group at 1600 cm−1, and the C–O–C functional group at 1300 cm−1 could be observed. Nevertheless, the ratio for the intensities of the CO/CC for the bio-char produced with the co-feeding of glycol was clearly higher, indicating the presence of abundant carbonyl functionalities in the bio-char (Fig. 7d). This result was in line with the results for the elemental characterization, where the bio-char produced from pyrolysis with co-feeding of glycol made the bio-char more oxygen-rich. Furthermore, the bio-char with co-feeding of glycol also showed relatively stronger absorption for the aliphatic C–O–C structures. The pyrolysis of cellulose at 600 °C weakened the absorption of these oxygen-containing functionalities via intensified cracking reactions (Fig. 7b). 3.5.3 XRD results Fig. 8 shows the XRD diffraction pattern of the bio-char samples. For all the bio-char samples produced at the different conditions, two main peaks were obtained, which were centred at 22° and 44°, indicating the two crystalline surfaces of the carbon (002) and C (100) in the bio-chars produced. By increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 600 °C, the intensities of the peaks enhanced, showing the increase of the crystallinity of the bio-chars. This could be also due to the decrease of the oxygen content in the bio-char structure, as shown by elemental analysis results (Tables 3 and 4). The peak appeared at 22° is ascribed to the presence of aromatic carbon sheets [4,42], the intensity of which increased by increasing the pyrolysis temperature. The diffraction pattern at 44° was also related to the graphite-free crystal surface [4,42]. At pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C, the co-feeding of ethanol and glycol could clearly enhance the crystallinity of these two crystal faces. 3.5.4 Raman analysis of the bio-char Fig. 9 shows the results for the Raman characterization of the bio-chars produced at the different conditions. Two peaks centred at 1350 cm−1 (band D) and at 1550 cm−1 (band G) were recorded for all the bio-chars. These bands are the main typical peaks shown in the bio-chars [43,44]. The D band corresponds to the plane vibration of the sp2 bonded disordered-type carbon structure with structural defects, and the G band corresponds to the plane vibration of the sp2 bonded graphite structure [35]. At the pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C, band D for the bio-char without co-feeding alcohols showed a higher density. The D/G ratio indicated that the co-feeding of ethanol did not affect much the carbon with the SP3 hybridization in amorphous structure and that with the SP2 hybridization in graphite lattice. Nevertheless, the co-feeding of glycol promoted the graphitisation of the bio-char during the pyrolysis, as evidenced by the remarkably lower D/G ratio. The interaction between glycol and the bio-char was different at the varied pyrolysis temperature, as also indicated in Fig. 1 about the effects of co-feeding glycol on the yields of the bio-char. 3.5.5 TG curves The results from TG characterization of the thermal stability of bio-char samples are shown in Fig. 10 . The thermal stability of the bio-char samples produced at 400 or 600 °C showed the different trends. For the bio-char produced at 400 °C, the co-feeding with ethanol could substantially increase the thermal stabilities of the bio-char, followed by that produced with co-feeding glycol. The enhancement of the thermal stabilities of the bio-char with the co-feeding with ethanol could also be observed for the characterization of the bio-char produced at 600 °C. It was just the gap for the difference became smaller. The thermal stability of bio-char produced with co-feeding glycol at 600 °C, however, was lower than that of the bio-char produced without feeding of the alcohols. As indicated by the Raman results, there were some difference for the interaction between glycol and the bio-char formed at the varied pyrolysis temperature. The fundamental reason for the effects of the co-feeding of the alcohols on the thermal stability of the resulting bio-char, however, has not been understood yet and needs further investigation. 3.5.6 DRIFTS characterization of the bio-char Evolution of the functionalities in the bio-char versus the increasing temperature was investigated with the DRIFTS characterization, as shown in Figs. 11 and 12 . For the bio-chars produced at 400 °C, with the increase of the heating temperature the absorption of the –OH, C–H in alkenes, -C-H alkanes, absorbed CO2, CO, CC and C–O functional groups could be observed. The distribution of the functionalities in the bio-char with or without the co-feeding of the alcohols was similar. Nevertheless, with co-feeding of glycol, the ratios for the intensities for the carbonyl region were different from that with co-feeding ethanol or in the blank experiments, as shown in Tables 5 and 6 . Glycol or the derivatives of glycol clearly affected the formation of the carbonyl functionalities in the char formed. In addition, it needs to note that the results also indicated the abundance of the carbonyl functionalities in the bio-char produced at 400 °C. More importantly, these functionalities showed high stabilities. However, these oxygen-containing functionalities still decomposed at the elevated heating temperature, as evidenced by the absorption peaks of the absorbed CO2 formed from the cracking reactions. For the bio-char samples obtained at the pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C, the absorption of the –OH functional group could almost not be discernible, as the higher pyrolysis temperature facilitated the elimination of hydroxyl group on surface of the bio-char. In the absorption region for the carbonyl functionalities, the absorption peak also mainly became one. Nevertheless, in general, similar distribution of the functionalities was observed. The co-feeding of glycol showed much more remarkable effects on distribution of the oxygen-containing functionalities at the pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C. The yield of the bio-char shown in Fig. 1 also demonstrated the significant effect of co-feeding of the alcohols, especially glycol at the lower pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C."
11,Conclusions,"To sum up, the results showed that the co-feeding of the alcohols remarkably affected the distribution of the products and their properties in pyrolysis of cellulose. The glycol fed in or the derivatives of glycol cross-polymerized with the organics in the bio-char, which remarkably enhance bio-char yield and its oxygen content at the pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C, but such an effect was not observed at 600 °C. In converse, the co-feeding of ethanol decreased the production of bio-char and increased the carbon content and the evolution of the heavy fraction of bio-oil. The co-feeding of glycol also enhanced the formation of the heavy components with the π-conjugated ring structures, especially at the pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C. The co-feeding of alcohols also affected the production of the light components such as furfural, glycolaldehyde and the sugars, as the alcohols or their derivatives involved in the primary and secondary pyrolysis reactions. As for the production of the bio-char, the co-feeding glycol made the bio-char produced at 400 °C more oxygen-rich, originating from their cross-polymerisation/interaction reactions. In comparison, the co-feeding ethanol aided the removal of oxygen-containing species, making the bio-char more carbon-rich, especially at 600 °C. Furthermore, the co-feeding. The presence of the two alcohols could clearly enhance the crystallinity of bio-char. In addition, the co-feeding of ethanol did not affect much the carbon with the SP3 hybridization in amorphous structure and that with the SP2 hybridization in graphite lattice, while glycol enhanced the graphitisation of the bio-char. The co-feeding of the alcohols also significantly affected the thermal stability of the bio-char produced. The co-feeding with ethanol or glycol could substantially increase the thermal stabilities of the bio-char, while the co-feeding with glycol at 600 °C led to the bio-char with the lower thermal stability. This study has demonstrated the significant influence of co-feeding of the alcohols on pyrolysis of cellulose. Nevertheless, the mechanism of some aspects such as the reason beneath the impacts of the co-feeding of alcohols on thermal stability of the bio-char needs to be further clarified. In addition, it should be noted that the use of ethanol and glycol were to investigate the impacts of co-feeding alcohols on the pyrolysis behaviors of cellulose. More specifically, it would be of importance if the alcohols could enhance the yields of the resulting bio-oil or the production of a certain value-added chemicals. The study is more about the proof of concept. The industrial application of the pyrolysis of biomass (including cellulose) with co-feeding of alcohols could be considered but after the overall evaluation of the value of products and the cost induced by the co-feeding of alcohols. The other strategy like the recycle of alcohols should also be considered to reduce the cost in the use of alcohols in the pyrolysis process."
