0,Introduction,"Food waste in Hong Kong is the single largest component of municipal solid waste with a daily generation of 3649 tonnes per day (HKEPD, 2017). Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a promising technology for both waste disposal and product recovery. Two-phase AD offers more advantages over traditional single-phase AD. However, the low efficiency of energy conversion is always the bottleneck. Mass balance analysis of two-phase anaerobic digesters indicated that H2 and CO2 generation in the acidogenic reactor accounted for ~30% of the consumed substrate (Schievano et al., 2012) and mostly this part of energy carried by H2 was lost due to reactor operation/ handling and hence decrease the overall energy recovery from the bioreactor. Under conventional operation, acidogenic biogas (mainly H2 and CO2) was retained in the headspace between the sampling intervals and this elevated H2 pressure would therefore inhibit further yield of H2 as well as hydrolysis of organic compounds involved (Wang et al., 2008). Therefore, reutilization of acidogenic off-gas to improve overall energy recovery is a promising strategy, which can simultaneously alleviate the inhibition caused by high H2 pressure. The idea of acidogenic off-gas reuse for enhancing CH4 generation was raised by Yan et al. (2016). Significant increase of CH4 production was achieved with reutilization of acidogenic off-gas whereas the concentration of CH4 in the final biogas decreased from (%) 70.7 ± 4.7 to 66.0 ± 4.3. Later on, levels of headspace pressure and the corresponding composition of headspace were studied and the optimized headspace pressure of ~3.3 psi under that senario was proposed (Yan et al., 2017). However, the ratio between H2 and CO2 was not high enough for efficient reuse of acidogenic gas, because reutilization through H2 + CO2 → CH4 + 2H2O needs a H2/CO2 ratio of at least 4.0 (Δ = −134 kJ/ mol), otherwise there will be extra CO2, which would affect the quality of final biogas product. Therefore, strategy to improve the H2/CO2 ratio is critical for efficient reuse of acidogenic biogas. Composition of the substrate food waste is one of the critical factors that determine the performance of acidogenic biogas production. Carbohydrates, commonly the largest component of food waste, are widely accepted to be easily and rapidly converted to simple monomers and subsequently converted to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and H2&CO2 via hydrolysis (Xia et al., 2015). Degradation of carbohydrate usually linked with the higher production of H2. Under the catalysis of hydrogenase enzymes, hydrogen-producing microorganisms oxidize reduced ferrodoxin (FdR) to produce molecular hydrogen. Both the generation of H2 and the H2/CO2 ratio in the acidogenic biogas could be influenced by fermentation pathways and the availability of FdR (Rydzak et al., 2014). These metabolic pathways are the result of a multitude of factors, including composition of the substrate especially the content of carbohydrate, levels of H2 partial pressure in the headspace and pH of the digesters. It was reported that carbohydrate supplementation could enhance the biohydrogen production from protein-rich sludge (Feng et al., 2009). Similarly, co-digestion of lipid-rich or protein-rich substrate with carbohydrates for H2 production was widely adopted by researchers (Fountoulakis and Manios 2009; Kim et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). However, little information is available on the ratio of H2/CO2, especially under the scheme of acidogenic off-gas reuse. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of substrate composition on acidogenic H2 and overall CH4 production under the scheme of acidogenic off-gas reuse in methanogenic reactor. Four types of food wastes with varied compositions were selected as substrates. Characterization of food wastes and performance of acidogenic H2 production was described; then, acidogenic metabolic behaviour was analysed based on the speciation of soluble products; and finally, overall performance of the acidogenic-methanogenic reactors and CH4 recovery was evaluated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Food waste and seed sludge,"2.1 Food waste and seed sludge Bakery waste was collected from Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) student hall canteen, while Chinese-style restaurant and western-style restaurant of HKBU were the sources of corresponding food wastes. Wet market wastes were collected from Lok Fu wet market, Hong Kong. In order to achieve representative components, the food wastes were collected for a period of one week on daily basis (stored in 4 °C cold lab) and mixed together. Before feeding to the reactors, bones, shells and other indigestible components were removed and large size components were cut evenly into small particles with a particle size of <6 mm. Relevant physicochemical characteristics of the four types of food wastes are presented in Table 1 . Anaerobically digested sludge with 2.2% total solids (TS) and 83% VS/TS obtained from Shek Wu Hui waste water treatment plant (WWTP) was used as the seed sludge."
3,Experimental set up,"2.2 Experimental set up Four types of food wastes collected from different sources (bakery shop, Chinese-style restaurant, Western-style restaurant and wet market), with different elemental compositions were used in this experiment. These food wastes were acidified in leach bed reactors (LBR) and then the leachates were diverted to methanogenic reactors (upflow anaerobic sludge blanket, UASB) for CH4 production as presented in Yan et al. (2016). In addition, the acidogenic off-gas was also diverted to the UASB. As identified in a previous study, a headspace pressure of ~ 3.3 psi was applied in LBR (Yan et al., 2017). The reactor performance and the CH4 recovery was investigated with a focus on acidogenic H2 production and the ratio of H2/CO2. Mesophilic digestion controlled at 35 ± 1 °C in a batch mode of operation was used in this experiment as practiced in previous experiments. Four identical LBRs were filled with 2.0 kg of food waste with seeding of 20% (I/S, wet basis) AD sludge and ~10% of wood chips as bulking agent according to a previous study (Xu et al., 2012). Initially, equal volume of tap water was added to reach a liquid to solid ratio of 1.0, which means 2.0 L of tap water was added to each LBR. Lime was supplemented at the initial stage with a dosage of 14 g/kg food waste. Removal and sampling of acidognic leachate was performed once a day to avoid acid crisis in the LBR. During each sampling, the leachate was taken out and 50% of the leachate was recycled back to the LBR from the top after mixing with equal volume of water while the remaining 50% of the leachate was fed to corresponding UASB with 50 mL reserved for analysis."
4,Calculation of H2 production,"2.3 Calculation of H2 production As described in Yan et al. (2016), the acidogenic LBRs were equipped with pressure sensors for real-time monitoring of headspace pressure and mass flow controller (MFC; Seven Star, China) for both measurement and flow rate control of the acidogenic biogas. Both the pressure sensor and MFC were controlled by PID controller; and data monitoring software (AIDCS monitor) was used to record the real-time data of headspace pressure and biogas flow rate. Volume of biogas production in acidogenic reactor was calculated by both headspace pressure (the part retained in the headspace was calculated by State Equation of Ideal Gas) and off-gas going through MFC. Concentrations of H2 and CO2 in the acidogneic biogas were measured by gas chromatography (HP7890) equipped with TCD detector and PLOT-Q column (30 m × 0.53 mm × 15 µm). Calibration was performed using external gas standards: 100% CO2, 20% CO2 and 80% H2, and 100% H2, injected as 1.0 mL at 1 atm. Volume of H2 production could be calculated through the following equation, (1) Y H 2 = ∑ k = t n V t ∗ h t L where, Y H2 and Vt are cumulative H2 yield and volume of daily H2 production, respectively while ht represents daily H2 concentration in biogas."
5,Activity of hydrogenase,"2.4 Activity of hydrogenase Primer set of HG-f AAGAAGCTTTA GAAGATCCTAA and HG-r GGACAACATGAG GTAAACATTG (De Sa et al., 2011) encoding enzyme hydrogenase gene was selected to analyze the activity of hydrogenase during the evolution of H2 in the acidogenic reactor. Expression level of hydrogenase was used as an indicator for evaluation of H2 production potential of an acidogenic system. The total genomic DNA of the leachate and digestate samples were extracted according to methodology presented in Yan et al. (2014a). The expression of hydrogenase gene was analyzed using Stratagene Mx3000P™ Real-Time PCR System. The reactions (20 μL total volume) were performed with 10 μL iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 0.5 μM of each primer and 10 ng of each genomic-DNA as template. The thermal cycle parameters were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, then denaturation at 95 °C for 15 S, annealing 58 °C for 1 min and extension at 72 °C for 30 S (40 cycles) with dissociation curve included. The expression levels were determined by using external standard curve based on Ct values. The result of dissociation curve showed that the amplifications were performed well."
6,Analyses,"2.5 Analyses Parameters such as total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), total organic carbon (TOC), Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), carbohydrate, protein and lipid content of solid substrates, digestates after experiment and the seed sludge were analysed according to Yan et al. (2014b). For acidogenic leachate from LBR, volume, pH and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were analyzed before filtration, whereas soluble products (VFAs and solvents) were analyzed using a HP 6890 Series gas chromatograph (GC, Hewlett Packard) with flame ionization detector (FID) after filtration. Lactic acid in the filtered leachate was analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters Alliance 2695) coupled with Waters 2996 photo diode array (PDA) detector. Calculation of both soluble products and lactic acid were using standard curves obtained by injecting corresponding standard solutions. Sum of volatile fatty acids (acetate, propionate,iso- andn-butyrate,iso- andn-valerate and caproate), alcohols (ethanol, propanol and butanol), solvents (acetone) and lactate were defined as total soluble products (TSP). Volume of methanogenic biogas produced in UASB was measured by a wet gas flow meter (BSD-0.5, Shanghai). Biogas in the outlets of UASBs were periodically sampled using a gastight syringe (1 mL injection volume) and analyzed for the composition using gas chromatograph (HP7890) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and PLOT-Q column (30 m × 0.53 mm × 15 μm). Argon was used as the carrier gas. Calibration was performed using external gas standards: 100% CH4, 20% CH4 + 80% CO2, and 60% CH4 + 30% CO2 balanced in N2, injected as 1.0 mL at 1 atm. The statistical and correlation analysis of the results was carried out using SPSS Statistics v19 to evaluate the effect of carbohydrate contents on the generation of biogas. It was considered significant if P < 0.05."

8,Characterization of food waste and acidogenic H2 production,"3.1 Characterization of food waste and acidogenic H2 production Characteristics of food wastes collected from four different sources (bakery shop, Chinese restaurant, Western restaurant and vegetable market) in Hong Kong were analyzed and are presented in Table 1. These four types of food wastes varied greatly in terms of carbohydrate, protein and lipids. Moisture contents (MC) of these food wastes were in the range reported in the literature (Zhang et al., 2007b) except that of bakery waste (with a MC of ~49%), which was seldom studied as individual waste previously. The carbohydrates, proteins and lipids in the food wastes were closely related to the sources of food wastes. For example, bakery waste contained 72.3% carbohydrate due to the large amount of bread in the waste stream while 52.8 and 69.5% of carbohydrate were detected in food wastes collected from Chinese-style and Western-style restaurants, respectively. It was reported that hydrolysis was found to be the rate-limiting step for the conversion of carbohydrates (Miron et al., 2000). The contents of protein in the four wastes were ranging from 9.5% to 20.0%. Proteins can be hydrolysed to amino acids and further degraded to VFAs with or without H2 generation (Vavilin et al., 2008). Whereas, 55.40% of lipid was observed in the waste from wet market waste, in which a lot of fat was disposed together with vegetable leaves. Carbohydrates are easily degradable components and were the major source of H2 production (Xia et al., 2015; Fang and Liu 2002). Degradation of lipids from long chain fatty acids (LCFA) to acetate or propionate via β oxidation was closely related to the levels of H2 pressure, because β oxidation is thermodynamically unfavourable under standard conditions (Cirne et al., 2007). β oxidation can only occur at low H2 partial pressure, which can be reached by the presence of H2-consumers or can be externally controlled. Under acidogenic conditions, acidification was the rate-limiting step for conversion of lipids, while both hydrolysis and acidification were limiting for the conversion of proteins (Miron et al., 2000). H2 and CO2 are the two major components in the acidogenic biogas. Amount of acidogneic biogas produced in the reactor builds up the headspace pressure. Volumes and H2 contents of acidogenic biogas produced in four LBRs were present in Fig. 1 a and b. Similar to the observation by Zhang et al. (2013), supplementation of lime at the initial stage triggered the evolution of acidogenic biogas in T1, T2 and T3, while very low level of biogas was produced in T4 with wastes from the wet market (Fig. 1a). Without lag phase, acidogenic biogas production in T1 with bakery waste reached the highest peak on day 2, and after then decreased along the experiment. The short-lived peak production of biogas in T1 was likely due to the reduction in buffering capacity of the substrates leading to a low pH (as presented in Fig. 4b) as well as the shift of metabolic pathways (Venkata Mohan et al., 2007). High concentration of carbohydrates and low MC in T1 led to a highest organic loading rate (OLR), which induced rapid accumulation of fatty acids and thus decreased the pH. Biogas production in both T2 and T3 showed a lag phase of one day and then reached the peak production on day 2–3, and decreased from day 4. Peak production of biogas in T2 was lower than that in T1 and T3, which correlated with the carbohydrate content of corresponding food wastes. , i.e. T1 (72.3%) > T3 (69.5%) > T2 (52.8%), suggesting H2 was mainly sourced from the degradation of carbohydrates (Fang and Liu 2002). Compared with T1, T2 and T3, biogas production in T4 was constantly lower and the peak production was delayed to day 4–5, indicating poor performance of the acidogenic process. It was reported that degradation of lipids was quite difficult due to the unfavourable thermodynamic potential and basically lipids were assumed not to be degraded in the acidification phase (Miron et al., 2000). H2 content in the acidogenic biogas was another important factor that highly depended on the type of substrate and metabolic pathways. As presented in Fig. 1b, H2 content in the biogas ranged from 8.1% to 74.5%; and this range is wider than previous report of 41–59% (Li and Chen 2007). Increased concentration of H2 during the initial stage was likely due to the addition of lime, which not only enhanced the production of H2 but also improved the performance of the digesters (Zhang et al., 2017). Similar to the profile of biogas production, a lag phase was observed in T2, T3 and T4 for H2 production; whereas the content of H2 in T1 reached the peak on the first day. Apparently, the variations of H2 concentrations among four treatments were related to the compositions of substrates. Correlation analysis indicated that carbohydrate contents were significantly correlated with H2 production (p = 0.017) except bakery food waste with a varied loading condition (because of high TS content). Despite different peaks of acidogenic biogas production in T1-T3, the peaks of H2 contents were similar, suggesting similar metabolic reactions in the earlier stage of the experiment (Fig. 2 ). Distributions of acidogenic end products determined the concentration of H2, and active H2 production during days 1–4 of T1, T2 and T3 reactors coincided with the dominance of butyrate and acetate (Zheng et al., 2015; Fig. 2). H2 yield, calculated through Eq. (1) using the data of H2 content (ht, Fig. 1b) indicated cumulative H2 productions of 23.2 L, 22.5 L, 29.9 L and 5.3 L in T1, T2, T3 and T4 reactors, respectively. These values were equivalent to 24.5, 46.0, 61.0 and 11.3 L H2/ kg ·VSadded specific hydrogen production (SHP) in T1-T4 reactors. T3 with the western-style food waste showed the highest SHP production of 61.0 L H2/ kg ·VSadded, which was comparable to that of 66.7 L H2/ kg·VSadded reported with anaerobic fermentation of food waste in CSTR by Cavinato et al. (2012). Most of the H2 produced in acidogenic reactor (except the part retained in the headspace due to the pressure setting) was diverted to methanogenic UASBs for reutilization. Variations of CO2 and H2 constitute the dynamics of the headspace in acidogenic reactor, which affect the H2 production as well as metabolic pathways (Patra and Yu 2013; Nasr et al., 2015). Concentrations of CO2 in all four treatments were above 30% except the initial 3–4 days (Fig. 1c). During the first 2 days of T1, the environmental conditions was favourable for H2 generation and therefore CO2 concentration was low, but afterwards the content of CO2 increased, due to the inhibition of H2 production and shift of metabolic pathways. Lag phases were observed in T2-T4, which led to low levels of both H2 and CO2 on day one. Low levels of CO2 during day 2–3 in T2 and T3 should be similarly attributable to high H2 contents. When considering the reutilization of acidogenic biogas in methanogenic phase through hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, H2/CO2 ratio of the biogas is an important parameter affecting the efficiency of the reutilization as well as the quality of the final biogas. At least a H2/CO2 of 4.0 is needed to enable the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis to reduce CO2 to CH4. The H2/CO2 ratios observed in all four reactors were lower than 4.0 (Fig. 1d), suggesting unfavourable ratios for reutilization in methanogenic phase. Therefore, further exploration is necessary to increase the ratio of H2/CO2. The profiles of the activities of hydrogenase were presented in Fig. 2. Hydrogenase plays an important role during H2 generation, which would catalyse the reduction of proton to form H2 (2H+ + 2e- → H2) (Hallenbeck and Benemann. 2002). Hence, the expression levels of hydrogenase can be used as an indicator of H2 production in the reactor. As indicated in Fig. 2, the expression levels of hydrogenase in leachate samples were decreasing from day 3 to day 17, and a lowest level was observed in T4 with substrates sourced from wet market waste in all measuring stages (days 3, 8 and 17), indicating a poor performance of H2 evolution. On day 3, higher expression levels of hydrogenase in T1, T2 and T3 were achieved and this is likely due to the larger fractions of carbohydrate contents in corresponding wastes. The decrease of hydrogenase expression level in T1 was more obvious than that in T2 and T3, which might be related to the inhibition by low pH. Accompanied by the decreasing availability of easily biodegradable carbohydrates and accumulation of toxic compounds, lowest expression levels of hydrogenase were observed on day 17. Generally, the expression levels of hydrogenase in the digestate samples were lower than that in the leachate samples. And the variations among treatments were not as large as in leachate samples; however, the expression level in T4 was always the lowest."
9,Speciation of soluble products,"3.2 Speciation of soluble products Speciation of soluble products showed distinct variation with the function of substrate composition (Fig. 3 ). Generally, soluble products from the four treatments shared almost the same spectrums except that lactic acid was not detected in T4 treatment. However, the abundances of the individual soluble product were different. Mixed acid fermentation with domination of acetate and butyrate was common in all four treatments, while propionate and caproic acid were also abundant in T4 and high concentrations of propanol was observed in T1. Large amount of carbohydrates in T1 with bakery waste induced the production of lactic acid. Similarly, lactic acid was observed as the major fermentation product during AD of food waste by Zhang et al. (2007a). Production of lactic acid was usually associated with low pH and that agreed with constant low pH observed in T1 (Fig. 4b). Selectively production of lactic acid by decreasing the culture pH to 3.5 was demonstrated by Itoh et al. (2012). Large amount of carbohydrate of the bakery waste and relatively low pH in T1 triggered the generation of propanol also, production of which was probably due to the inhibition of high H2 pressure. It was reported that propanol can be produced through 1, 2-propanediol pathway by shunting carbon flux from glycolysis under suitable environmental conditions (Jain and Yan 2011). Ethanol, another reduced fermentation product, could be generated through acetyl-CoA pathway accompanied by depletion of H2 (Hwang et al., 2004). Acetate and butyrate can also be yielded from the branch of acetyl-CoA and both reactions can be proceeded with the evolution of H2 (Zhou et al., 2018). However, great portion of lactic acid together with ethanol and propanol evidenced the inhibition of H2. Different from T1, butyrate and acetate were dominant in T2 with small portions of ethanol, propionate and caproic acid. Degradation of 1 mol hexose to acetate or butyrate was about to generate 4 or 2 mol of H2, respectively. The dominance of butyrate and acetate was the index of H2 production and this was in consistent with the result of H2 production in Fig. 1. Besides the effect of H2 pressure, pH is always the critical factor determining the distribution of soluble intermediates as well as metabolic pathways. A pH range of 5.0–6.0 was reported to be favourable for butyrate production (Wang et al., 2014), which was evident in T2. Till now, the mechanism of caproic acid production was still unclear; however, two strategies of caproic acid production were proposed in the literatures: (1) higher organic load could lead to the production of caproic acid (Parawira et al., 2004); (2) n-caproic acid synthesis by chain elongation (Agler et al., 2014). Similar to T2, soluble fermentation intermediates in T3 were mainly composed of butyrate, acetate and ethanol, indicating a mixed acid fermentation type. Again, propionate and caproic acid were detected in smaller amount. Dominance of butyrate and acetate during the initial stage (days 2–4) was associated with vigorous H2 production and later the involvement of reduced compounds and the inhibition of H2-producing microbes under unfavourable conditions (pH and depletion of easily degradable carbohydrates) led to decreased H2 production. Propionate is an undesirable intermediate due to its toxicity to common anaerobes and degradation of which is thermodynamically unfavourable with ΔG = +76.1 kJ/mol (Amani et al., 2011; Schink and Stams, 2006). Distribution of fermentation soluble products in T4 was completely different from the other three treatments. No lactic acid was detected whereas relatively large portion of propionic acid was observed from day 4 to the end of this experiment. Obviously, this should be due to the high lipid contents in the wet market waste as it was reported that lipid could be degraded through mixed acid pathway with the ratio of acetic acid and propionic acid around 1 (Oh and Martin, 2010). Large portion of propionic acid may be the reason for the poor performance of T4 as propionic acid was thought to be inhibitory the AD process (Gourdon and Vermande, 1987). Presence of significant quantities of caproic acid might be related to the decrease of ethanol, which can serve as the 2-C unit for the chain elongation during caproate formation."
10,Performance of acidogenic-methanogenic reactors,"3.3 Performance of acidogenic-methanogenic reactors In this section, parameters indicating the general performance of acidogenic- methanogenic reactors such as leachability (volume of leachate production), pH, production of COD and TSP, and the overall CH4 recovery are discussed (Table 2 ). As expected, the changes of hydrolysis behaviour triggered by varied compositions of substrates affected the performance of acidogenic fermentation as well as second phase methane production. Volumes of leachate produced in the four treatments with different substrates are depicted in Fig. 4a. The profiles can be grouped into two categories: T1 with a range of 700–1800 mL and T2-T4 with a range of 2300–3100 mL, indicating that the leachability of food waste was significantly affected by the composition of the substrate. Comparing with T2-T4, less leachate was produced in T1, which was likely due to the lowest moisture content of the bakery waste. The increasing trend of leachate production along the experimental time was probably due to the hydrolytic reactions. Overall, leachate production in all four treatments was increasing along the experimental process. pH is always the critical parameter in anaerobic digestion system. As presented in Table 1, pH of food waste is relatively acidic in nature. While different food wastes differ in pH when fresh, pH falls upon slight decomposition, which would most likely be exacerbated by the production of acid from acidogens. Hence, the addition of sufficient alkali, i.e. 14 g lime /kg∙food waste in these LBRs was necessary. Alternately, organic loading should be regulated carefully and sufficient dilutions are needed to ensure a healthy microbial population and hydrolysis. As illustrated in Fig. 4, from day 4 to the end of this experiment, pH of all the four treatments were between 4.0 and 6.0, coinciding with the reported favourable range for anaerobic hydrolysis (Chen et al., 2007). However, pH was constantly lower than 5.0 with bakery waste and this might have dominated the environmental conditions, and subsequently the metabolic pathways in T1. Constant low pH in T1 should be related to high percentage of carbohydrates, as carbohydrates are much easier to be degraded to volatile fatty acids (carbohydrate is a superior short-term fuel for organisms because they are simpler to metabolize than lipid) (Yin et al., 2016). Digestion of lipid rich food waste collected from wet market showed the highest pH during the whole process due to the slow degradation of the lipid and the cellulosic polymers in the vegetables resulting in fewer amounts of volatile fatty acids production. COD production represents the liquefaction of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. As is shown in Fig. 5 a&b, both daily and cumulative COD leaching profiles varied greatly among the four treatments. The burst of COD production from days 1 to 7 in T1, i.e. 119.2 ± 4.5 g/L on day 3 (Fig. 5a) should be related to the strong alkalinity of lime that enhanced the cleavage of easily degradable carbohydrates. However, the extent of decrease in COD production was high, e.g. from 119.2 ± 4.5 to 15.2 ± 0.3 g/L, which might be attributable to the phenomenon of carbon repression encountered during the complex anaerobic metabolism (Venkata Mohan et al., 2007). Product inhibition could be a crucial factor that affected the hydrolysis rate at high solid loading as observed by Ginkel and Logan (2005). Besides, the less moisture content should result in less dilution of the COD generated leading to high concentrations compared with the other three treatments. Obviously, COD leaching in the other three treatments were much lower than that of T1 treatment. Daily COD production in T2-T4 were also lower than that in T1, and variations among them were not significant, probably due to the relatively low OLRs and less amounts of easily degradable components. It was reported that carbohydrate was much easier to be degraded followed by protein, and lipid (Miron et al., 2000). The theory was confirmed in T4; more than 55% of lipid content led to the constant lower COD leaching of wet market waste. Decrease of COD production in all four treatments during the latter half of the experiment should be related to the reduction in buffering capacity as well as the lack of easily degradable organic fractions. Slight increase of COD from day 8 to day 13 in T1 might due to the acclimation of microbes to the acidic environment. Because of variations of moisture contents among the four treatments, profiles of cumulative COD production were not consistent with that of daily COD. Highest value of cumulative COD production was achieved in T3 with food waste collected from western-style restaurant, followed by T1, T2 and T4. Degradation of lipid was quite difficult (Cirne et al., 2007) and thus the lowest COD was leached from wet market waste. Daily and cumulative production profiles of TSP were presented in Fig. 5c and d. The trend of TSP production was similar to COD profiles; however, the peak production is a bit delayed compare to COD production because of the fact that formation of TSP was sourced from solubilisation of COD. Despite the big difference in daily COD production profiles between T1 and the other treatments, the differences of TSP production were not as large as that of COD, which indicated that solid particles (particulates) were not solubilized thoroughly in T1. Despite the highest values of TSP yields in T1 treatment, cumulative TSP production in in T3 was the highest, which is consistent with COD leaching profile. Further, higher cumulative TSP in T2 and T4 indicated higher solubilization degree of COD and this can facilitate the utilization of soluble products in the subsequent methanogenic phase. Profiles of daily and cumulative CH4 production were presented in Fig. 6 . Results indicated that daily CH4 yield exhibited a trend similar to that of TSP production in LBR, which suggested CH4 production was closely related to the leachate quality. Extremely large volume of CH4 production on day 2 of T1 and T3 treatments should be attributable to the contribution of H2 as evidenced from Fig. 1. Large portion of lactic acid in the leachate of T1 treatment probably caused the inhibition on methanogenesis. In addition, the significant fraction of particulates in the COD (as indicated by the TSP/COD ratio) of T1 reactor should have delayed the CH4 production after the initial burst of CH4 production and eventually reduced the cumulative CH4 production. Constant low rate of CH4 production in T4 was closely related to the high percentage of lipid. Lipids were assumed not to be degraded in acidogenic phase and their degradation products, LCFAs, were reported to inhibit methanogenesis severely (Cirne et al., 2007) resulting in eventual reduction of overall methane recovery. In addition, when these LCFAs are transferred to the UASB, they must be oxidised to VFA by the acetogenic bacteria to acetate before used up for CH4 production. Therefore, the CH4 production efficiency was lowered. The conversion of H2 and CO2 to CH4 requires a ratio of 4.0; however, as evidenced from Fig. 1 none of the four treatments had reached the ratio of 4.0. So the CO2 transferred from acidogenic reactor can not be totally converted and thus this led to a lower CH4 concentration in the final biogas."
11,Conclusion,"Highest H2 recovery of 61.0 L/kg·VSadded was achieved in T3, which was closely related to the carbohydrate content in the food waste from western-style restaurant. The dominance of acetate and butyrate with mixed acid metabolic pathway was associated with decent H2 production. Volatile solid (VS) removal and COD production were also closely related to carbohydrate content in the substrate. A high specific methane production rate of 0.42 L/g·VSadded indicated that favorable leachate quality and more H2 generation were responsible for enhanced CH4 production. This study could provide insights for enhanced product recovery from anaerobic valorization of organic solid waste and contribute to reduce carbon footprint."
