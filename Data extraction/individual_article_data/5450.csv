0,Introduction,"The shortage of fossil fuels in a near future will be the cause of great energetic problems in the world. In the last years many researcher groups have been studying new technologies for energy production. In this context the hydrogen fuel cells are the most promising systems and the key is an efficient hydrogen production. Different production methods can be used: water electrolysis, gasification, partial oxidation reactions of heavy oil and steam reforming reactions. Nowadays natural gas is the most widespread and economic way of producing hydrogen [1]. Hydrogen production from renewable sources such as the ethanol steam reforming is calling the attention and may become an important industrial process. Ethanol has several advantages compared to other raw materials but the most important is its renewable origin and the consequent reduction in CO2 emission [2]. It has relatively high hydrogen content and its reaction in the presence of water is able to produce 6mol of hydrogen per mol of fed ethanol. (1) C2H5OH+3H2O→2CO2 +6H2 From a thermodynamic point of view the reaction (1) is highly favored. In the practice, other reactions simultaneously occur and the reactor effluent contains a wide range of liquid and gaseous products. Different catalytic systems have been studied in this reaction using different metals (Rh, Pt, Pd, Ru, Ni, Cu, Zn, Fe, and Co) and various supports (Al2O3, ZrO2, MgO, etc.) [3–14]. Auprête et al. [13] have studied the influence of metal nature on Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, CeO2–Al2O3 and CeO2–ZrO2. They found that γ-Al2O3 supported 1% Rh or 9.7% Ni catalysts were the most active and selective catalysts for ethanol steam reforming, with H2 production rates of 2.3 and 3.1 g h − 1 g cat − 1 , respectively at 700°C. A very good activity was reported on Cu–Ni–K/γ-Al2O3 at a temperature as low as 300°C [15] with H2 yield around 1.3mol H2/mol C2H5OH. Ni supported on MgO also showed an excellent performance with 100% of ethanol conversion at 650°C. On this catalyst, H2 yield was very high (5.2mol H2/mol C2H5OH) with a moderate coke formation [10]. The addition of alkali on Ni/MgO catalysts was also investigated [16]. Recently, NiZnAl catalysts have also been examined in the ethanol steam reforming [17]. The activity and selectivity to H2 are high when the reaction is operated at a relatively high reaction temperature (600°C). At this temperature a large amount of CO is produced which would require multi-stage water gas shift and preferential oxidation reactors downstream to produce H2 suitable for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. The formation of nickel carbide during reaction and the coke deposition were observed on these catalysts, as a consequence, their industrial use is improbable. The main challenge for ethanol steam reforming seems to be the development of highly active catalysts with a high resistance to coke deposition. It has been shown that the addition of CeO2 on Ni/Al2O3 improves reforming activity and resistance towards carbon deposition in dry reforming of methane [18,19]. These enhancements are mainly due to the influence of the redox properties of ceria. Besides, oxides with high oxygen storage capacity such as CeO2 have exhibited a high activity in the water gas shift reaction (CO+H2O→CO2 +H2) [20–22]. Then, ceria should be a good additive promoter for ethanol steam reforming. In this work, the effect of ceria addition on NiZnAl catalyst is examined. Activity in the ethanol steam reforming reaction and deactivation studies together with characterization data from X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM–EDAX, BET, Raman and thermal gravimetry (TG) are presented."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation NiZnAl catalysts were prepared by a sol–gel method by using aluminium isopropoxide (AIP) as a source of Al. The procedure was similar to that reported in literature [23]. The hydrolysis of AIP was carried out at 95°C in a batch reactor. A bohemite stable sol was obtained by using a molar ratio of 200mol H2O/mol AIP and the following solutions were added to the sol dropwise: (a) a solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in isopropyl alcohol; (b) nitrate aqueous solutions, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, in the necessary amounts to obtain a final loading of 30wt.% Ni and between 2 and 10wt.% Ce. After the addition of 0.7molH+/mol AIP transparent gels with low viscosity were obtained and they were submitted to evaporation until the volume was reduced in a 1/3. The aging was carried out in the thermostatic bath at 65°C overnight. The solids were dried at 100°C for 10h and finally they were decomposed in N2 flow under the following temperature program: from room temperature to 150°C; at 150°C for 2h to eliminate the remained water; from 150 to 350°C at a heating rate, β, of 5°Cmin−1; at 350°C for 1h; from 350 to 500°C at the same β; at 500°C for 5h and then cooling to room temperature. The samples were denoted as NZA-Cex where “x” indicates the cerium nominal weight%. The sample without Ce was named as NZA-Ce0."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization All samples were characterized using different physico-chemical methods. 2.2.1 Chemical composition Chemical composition was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Alkali fusion with KHSO4 and subsequent dissolution with diluted HCl brought the samples into solution. The measurements were carried out using a Varian AA50 equipment. The Ce was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) with a Baird ICP 2070 spectrometer. 2.2.2 BET surface area BET surface areas were measured using a Micromeritics Accusorb 2100E instrument by adsorption of nitrogen at −196°C on 200mg of sample previously degassed at 200°C for 2h under high vacuum atmosphere. 2.2.3 X-ray diffraction XR diffraction patterns were obtained with a Rigaku diffractometer operated at 30kV and 20mA by using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.15418nm) at a rate of 3°min−1 from 2θ =20° to 2θ =80°. The powdered samples were analyzed without previous treatment after deposition on a quartz sample holder. The identification of crystalline phases was made by matching with the JCPDS files. The Scherrer formula was used to estimate the crystallite size. 2.2.4 Thermal gravimetry The analyses were recorded using TGA 51 Shimadzu equipment. The samples, ca. 15mg, were placed in a Pt cell and heated from room temperature to 1000°C at a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 with a gas feed (air or N2) of 50mlmin−1. 2.2.5 Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) Studies were performed in a conventional TPR equipment. This apparatus consists of a gas handling system with mass flow controllers (Matheson), a tubular reactor, a linear temperature programmer (Omega, model CN 2010), a PC for data acquisition, a furnace and various cold traps. Before each run, the samples were treated in He at 300°C for 30min. After that, the system was cooled down at 25°C. The samples were subsequently contacted with a 30mlmin−1 flow of 5 vol.% H2 in N2, heated at a rate of 5°Cmin−1 from 25°C to a final temperature of 700°C and held at 700°C for 1h. Hydrogen consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector after removing the water formed. The characteristic P number assuming only nickel reduction was around 10°C in order to obtain an unperturbed reduction profile [24]. 2.2.6 Acid–base properties Acidity measurements were determined by ammonia temperature-programmed desorption, TPD, by using a conventional flow system with a thermal conductivity detector. In each experiment ca. 0.2g was used. All samples were prereduced under a (5%) H2/N2 flow at 600°C for 1h to simulate the catalyst state under reforming conditions. After cooling down to room temperature the adsorption step started. This step was carried out in pure ammonia flow for 30min. Then, the samples were swept with helium for 30min and finally, the desorption step was performed from room temperature to 700°C at a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 and 30mlmin−1 of helium total flow. Continuous voltages from the detector cell and reactor thermocouple were converted to digital signals, amplified with a data acquisition workstation and stored in a PC. The total integrated area of the NH3 band was considered as a measure of total acidity. 2.2.7 SEM–EDX Scanning electron micrographs were obtained in a LEO 1450 VP. This instrument is equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray microanalyzer, EDAX Genesis 2000 with Si(Li) detector, which permitted analytical electron microscopy measurements. The samples were sputter coated with gold. 2.2.8 Raman spectroscopy The Raman spectra were run with a JASCO TRS-600SZ-P equipped with a CCD detector. The samples were excited with the 514nm Ar line and the spectra acquisition consisted of five accumulations of 180s for each sample. 2.2.9 Temperature-programmed oxidation Carbon deposited during reaction was evaluated after a combustion process. Around 50mg of used sample were treated with a 2% O2/N2 flow under a temperature program from room temperature to 800°C at 10°Cmin−1. CO2 produced during this oxidation was analyzed by a flame ionization detector after passing through a methanizer."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The ethanol steam reforming reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed quartz tubular reactor operated at atmospheric pressure. The reactor is placed in a vertical furnace, which is controlled by a programmable temperature controller. The reaction temperature was measured with a coaxial thermocouple. The feed was a gas mixture of ethanol, water and helium (free of oxygen). Ethanol and water were fed through independent saturators before mixing. The flow rates of gas stream were controlled by mass flowmeters. The total flow rate was 70mlmin−1 at room temperature with an ethanol molar composition of 3%. The H2O:C2H5OH molar ratio was 4 in all the experiments. The catalyst weight was 300mg (0.3–0.4mm particle size range selected after preliminary mass transport experiments to minimize diffusional resistances). The catalyst was heated to reaction temperature under He flow, then the mixture with C2H5OH+H2O was allowed to enter into the reactor to carry out the catalytic test. In all the cases fresh samples were used. The reactants and reaction products were analyzed on-line by gas chromatography. H2, CH4, CO2 and H2O were separated by a 1.8-m carbosphere (80–100 mesh) column and analyzed by TC detector. Nitrogen was used as an internal standard. Besides, CO was analyzed by a flame ionization detector after passing through a methanizer. Higher hydrocarbons and oxygenated products (C2H4O, C2H4, C3H6O, C2H5OH, etc.) were separated in Rt-U PLOT capillary column and analyzed with FID using N2 as carrier gas. The activity was measured at each temperature for 5h. The homogeneous contribution was tested with the empty reactor. These runs showed no activity at 500°C whereas the ethanol conversion was 3% at 600°C being acetaldehyde the only product. Ethanol conversion and selectivity to products were defined as X EtOH = F EtOH in − F EtOH out F EtOH in × 100 S i = ν i F i out 2 ( F EtOH in − F EtOH out ) × 100 S H 2 = F H 2 out 3 ( F EtOH in − F EtOH out ) + ( F H 2 O in − F H 2 O out ) × 100 Being F i in and F i out the molar flow rates of product “i” at the inlet and outlet of the reactor, respectively, and ν i the number of carbon atoms in “i”."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of fresh catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of fresh catalysts Thermogravimetric analyses of precursors were carried out with the aim of determining the decomposition conditions. Since the gels after the drying step at 100°C during 10h are able to retain a great amount of water molecules, the decomposition was studied after a first heating step (150°C for 2h). The TG curve for the NZA-Ce10 precursor (not shown) presents three zones of weight loss: up to 160°C (7.15%) which corresponds to the elimination of physisorbed water or water molecules retained in the solid network; between 160 and 290°C (11.75%) and the main weight loss between 290 and 500°C (33.33%) attributed to the gel transformation in spinel phases ZnAl2O4, CeO2 and NiO. The total loss weight was 47.3% as regards the original weight. Above 500°C, no change in the TG curve is observed. Taking into account these results the calcination program was chosen as it is indicated in Section 2. Some characteristics of catalysts are shown in Table 1 . The Zn/Al molar ratio is kept nearly constant. The specific surface area for NZA-Ce0 sample (105m2 g−1) is found to be of the same order than the highest values reported in literature [25]. The addition of Ce results in increased surface areas. The values are in the range of 124–128m2 g−1 without significant changes with Ce loading. Similar results were reported on Ni/γAl2O3 catalysts prepared by sol–gel method with the addition of lanthanides [26]. The X-ray patterns of catalysts after thermal treatment at 500°C are shown in Fig. 1 . In order to compare XRD patterns of ZA (free of Ni and Ce) and ZA-Ce12 (free of Ni) samples prepared by the same technique, are also shown. The XRD pattern of ZA shows intense and broad diffraction lines of the ZnAl2O4 spinel phase (2θ =31.3°, 36.8°, 44.8°, 55.6°, 59.4° and 65.3°, JCPDS-5-669). For ZA-Ce12, besides the peaks already observed corresponding to ZnAl2O4, reflections at 28.5°, 47.5° and 56.3° associated with crystalline CeO2 (JCPDS-34-394) are also observed. The diffraction patterns of NZA-Cex catalysts reveal peaks of NiO (2θ =43.3°, 37.3°, 62.9°, JCPDS-4-835) and CeO2, whereas those assigned to ZnAl2O4 become broader and of lower intensity suggesting a minor crystalline size or a lower crystallinity. A plausible explanation could be found in the mechanism of crystal growth of spinel phase during calcination which is affected by the presence of NiO. In literature, it has also been reported small crystallite sizes for zinc aluminate prepared by sol–gel process [27]. The presence of ZnO, NiAl2O4 and Al2O3 cannot be ruled out. The broad peak at 2θ =37.1° could be overlapped reflections of NiO and NiAl2O4. After H2 reduction, this peak has almost disappeared (see Fig. 3). The peak at ca. 36.4° can also be overlapped reflections of ZnAl2O4 and ZnO (JCPDS-36-1451). The presence of Ce affects the reduction of Ni2+ species as it is shown by temperature-programmed reduction, Fig. 2 . There is a great difference in the reduction between NiO alone and Ni species in NZA-Cex catalysts. Thus, for the pure oxide only one peak is observed at 364°C [17] whereas TPR profiles of NZA-Cex present three peaks of H2 consumption. For NZA-Ce0, they are centered at 353, 474 and 680°C and could be attributed to the reduction of NiO particles in different sizes or to a different interaction degree with the spinel matrix. Similar results are reported in the literature [28]. In samples with Ce, the first peak intensity has decreased whereas the intensity of the last one (at 662°C) increased. These changes could be attributed to changes in Ni-support interactions, the appearance of Ce–Ni interactions, changes in the Ni2+ dispersion and/or the partial reduction of CeO2. XRD of reduced samples shown in Fig. 3 reveal peaks corresponding to Ni0 (2θ =44.5°, 51.8°, 76.4°, JCPDS 4-0850) related to the crystalline planes (111), (200) and (220). The diffraction peaks corresponding to ZnAl2O4 become sharper, resulting from the crystallization process and grain growth because of thermal effects. The final temperature in TPR is 700°C. The reduction provokes a slight decrease in the relative intensity of the diffraction peaks assigned to CeO2. The acidity of the reduced catalysts determined by ammonia temperature-programmed desorption is reported in Fig. 4 . The shapes of profiles are similar. Then, a similar acid site distribution with differences in concentrations is observed in all the samples. Curve (a) corresponds to the TPD spectrum of ZA which is the result of the overlap of different types of sites including physisorbed ammonia (the adsorption temperature of ammonia was 25°C in all the experiments). It clearly shows the presence of surface acidity in different strengths. The strong acidity in all samples is revealed by the peak at 697°C which is related to the spinel phase. Curves (b) and (c) illustrate the influence of Ni and Ce on the surface acidity. On the NZA-Ce0 sample peaks at 276 and 365°C become relatively more intense. If the contribution of physisorbed and weakly chemisorbed NH3 (up to 200°C) is not taken into account, the whole acidity follows the order of NZA-Ce0≅ZA>NZA-Ce10. This characteristic could be very important for decreasing coke deposition."
7,Catalytic steam reforming results,"3.2 Catalytic steam reforming results The activity of catalysts is tested in steam reforming of ethanol under different conditions. In Table 2 the catalytic results on NZA-Ce0 and NZA-Ce10 at 400°C are shown. Nearly 100% of ethanol conversions are obtained. At this temperature a great influence of Ce over the product distribution is observed. An important amount of hydrocarbon compounds (CH4, C2H4O, C3H6O, etc.) is detected. These compounds are responsible of the low H2 selectivity. Significant selectivities to acetone (54.2%) and CO2 (32.6%) without CO formation are detected on NZA-Ce10. On the contrary, an important amount of CH4 (42.1%), CO (20.0%) and a minor formation of acetone (18.3%) are observed on NZA-Ce0. The selectivity to ethylene is low in both catalysts being higher on the modified catalyst. This behavior calls the attention because the surface acidity is lower on NZA-Ce10. The presence of CeO2 into NZA system promotes the steam reforming of ethanol to acetone and hydrogen (2C2H5OH+H2O→C3H6O+CO2 +4H2) at low temperature. Nishiguchi et al. have considered that the basic sites of CeO2 on CuO–CeO2 catalysts promote the aldol condensation to acetone [29]. In Table 3 the catalytic results at 500°C for all the samples are shown. The catalysts are very active with ethanol conversion of 100% in all the cases. The only products observed are H2, CO2, CO and CH4. The H2 selectivity increases from 85.8% on NZA-Ce0 to 89.8% on NZA-Ce10. The selectivities to CH4 and CO are near the same on NZA-Ce0 which is suggesting that the ethanol reforming (C2H5OH+3H2O→2CO2 +6H2) and decomposition (C2H5OH→CO+CH4 +H2) simultaneously occur. The selectivity to CH4 decreases with increasing Ce loading while CO selectivity remains almost constant. These results suggest that CH4 reforming and water gas shift reactions occur in a major extent over catalysts with Ce at this temperature. When a similar catalyst was prepared by citrate method and tested under the same conditions, comparable results were reported in literature, although 4.3% of other compounds were also detected [17]. When the temperature increases up to 700°C, the selectivity to CO2 decreases and CH4 is not observed (Table 4 ). The methane reforming reaction is very fast at this temperature and carbon monoxide selectivity markedly increases. Probable reactions of carbon removal and reverse water gas shift reaction also contribute to increase CO. At all temperatures, the catalysts exhibit stable activity and selectivity during 300min of time on stream, Fig. 5 . However, the carbon balances at 400 and 500°C are relatively low indicating a continuous carbon formation on the catalyst surface. The decrease in carbon balance is lower on NZA-Ce10. A visual observation of catalytic bed post-reaction also suggests the coke deposition."
8,Characterization after test,"3.3 Characterization after test The carbon deposits on catalysts after being used in the reforming reaction are examined by thermogravimetry under oxidative conditions, TPO-TG, and determination of carbon amount. The results shown in Fig. 6 compare the carbon amount of catalysts used at 500°C during 300min. From these data, it could be inferred that increasing Ce content decreases the carbon deposition. Significant differences are revealed by TPO-TG analyses as it is shown in Fig. 7 . A well-defined oxidation peak at 583°C appeared on NZA-Ce0 whereas broad peaks between 400 and 620°C are observed on NZA-Ce2, NZA-Ce5 and NZA-Ce10. Different carbon structures are responsible for this behavior. In literature, oxidation peaks at low temperature have been ascribed to carbon on nickel surface [30] whereas the peaks at higher temperature than 550°C are ascribed to oxidation of coke deposits with different degree of graphitization [26]. Over Ni supported Ce–Zr–O catalysts, Chen et al. have assigned the peak at 572°C during TGA experiment to carbon deposits in the filament form [31]. For NZA-Cex catalysts with x ≠0, carbon is more reactive and it should be mainly deposited on catalytic surface diminishing the formation of carbon filaments as indicated by the lower relative intensity of the peak at ca. 580°C. It is well known that very reactive amorphous carbon can nucleate around nickel particles and can be removed by carbon gasification [32]. When the reforming reaction is carried out at 700°C the carbon amounts are 1.6 and 0.6% on NZA-Ce0 and NZA-Ce10, respectively.In Fig. 8 , the XRD of catalysts used at 500°C are compared. The peaks corresponding to ZnAl2O4, NiO and Ni0 and to CeO2 in the samples containing Ce are observed. The reflection (002) of graphitic carbon at 2θ =26.4° (JCPDS: 41-1487) is also detected. This peak is very intense for NZA-Ce0 indicating a high formation of graphitic carbon species in agreement with TPO-TG observations. Peaks at 2θ =42.8° and 49.8° ascribed to Ni3ZnC0.7 are also observed. The presence of carbide phase suggests that carbon migrates through the bulk of the metallic particle [33]. In literature, compounds such as Ni3C are considered intermediate in the carbon filament formation on Ni/Al2O3 catalysts [34]. A significant filament formation is observed on NZA-Ce0 catalyst by SEM, as it will be further shown. In Fig. 9 , XRD patterns of NZA-Ce10 catalyst used at different reaction temperatures are shown. When the reaction is carried out at 400°C, the XRD reveals the peak corresponding to Ni0 at 2θ =44.5° but NiO remains as well. At higher temperatures, and due to the high H2 production, the catalyst undergoes a deeper reduction under test (it should be taken into account that the catalyst is not reduced before reforming reaction). The peak assigned to Ni0 becomes very sharp at 700°C with metallic particle sizes around 28nm (estimated by Scherrer equation). At this temperature the spinel and ceria phases become more crystalline. At 400 and 500°C, a weak peak at 2θ =49.8° corresponding to carbide phase is also observed. This phase seems to be absent when the reaction temperature is 700°C. The nature and characteristics of carbon deposits are also studied by Raman spectroscopy which has shown to be a powerful technique for characterizing the structure of carbon deposits. In Fig. 10 , the Raman spectra of used samples are shown in the range of 1200–1700cm−1. In all the cases, two broad bands centered at 1593 and 1350cm−1 are observed which are attributed to the stretching mode of carbon sp2 bonds of the typical graphite and to the vibrations of carbon atoms with dangling bonds in disordered graphite planes, respectively. The band at 1350cm−1, known as D band, has higher intensity than the band at 1593cm−1, known as G band. Then, a predominance of disordered structures such as amorphous carbon, nanoparticles of carbon or filamentous can be concluded [35]. From these results, the carbon structures seem to be the same, although differences in the relative intensity of the bands are observed. Bands G and D are deconvoluted to determine their areas and to evaluate the D/G ratio. Different values are obtained for a same sample suggesting a non-homogeneous carbon deposition. When the reaction is carried out at 700°C the spectra for NZA-Ce10 and NZA-Ce0 are near the same to those obtained for fresh samples which is a clear evidence that carbon deposition is negligible under this reaction condition. The SEM micrographs of fresh and used catalysts are presented in Fig. 11 . The SEM micrographs for the fresh samples, Fig. 11(a) and (d), show particles of different morphologies. Significant changes are observed after being reformed at different reaction temperatures. In agreement with Raman, XRD and TPO results, the SEM observations indicate the presence of a well-defined filament conformation on NZA-Ce0 catalyst, Fig. 11(b), and none on NZA-Ce10, Fig. 11(e), when the reaction temperature is 500°C. A non-structured coke seems to be formed on the last one. After a thorough examination of samples used at 700°C, filaments are not observed under the detection limit of this technique, Fig. 11(c) and (f). Reactions of carbon removal such as gasification of coke and Boudouard reactions could occur under the reforming conditions used in this work and they contribute to explain the post-reaction characterization results. The occurrence of these reactions enhances the deactivation resistance. If the carbon removal rate is higher than the carbon deposition rate, the carbon amount on catalyst surface should be negligible as it is observed at 700°C. Assuming the formation of amorphous carbon, C(A), the following reactions are thermodynamically favored: C ( A ) + 2 H 2 O → C O 2 + 2 H 2 , Δ G 500 ° C 0 = − 1.5 kcal mo l − 1 C ( A ) + H 2 O → CO + H 2 , Δ G 600 ° C 0 = − 2.72 kcal mo l − 1 C ( A ) + C O 2 ↔ 2 CO, Δ G 600 ° 0 = − 1.05 kcal mo l − 1 The graphitic carbon needs higher temperature to be removed. In fact, the above reactions are not thermodynamically feasible at lower temperature (500°C) if graphitic carbon is involved. The influence of the first reactions in consuming carbon directly from the coke was checked by means of a complementary experiment. After using the NZA-Ce10 catalyst at 500°C for 180min (at this temperature, coke formation is important, Fig. 6), the temperature was increased at 700°C in helium flow. Then, steam was allowed to enter into the reactor. The production of CO and H2 was very high with almost 100% of water conversion after 10min of time on stream. This conversion decreased approximately to 20% after 40min in reaction. In Fig. 12 , the results obtained when Boudouard reaction was studied on NZA-Ce10 are shown. In this case after 130min of time on stream at 500°C, the ethanol and water flows were stopped. Then, a CO2 flow (1.2×10−4 molmin−1) in He was allowed to enter into the catalytic bed and the temperature was raised to 600°C. From the beginning, a high CO formation is observed. CO decreased with time whereas CO2 increased. The original CO2 concentration was recovered after 50min. The post-reaction characterization also indicates different extents of metallic species sintering. However, under the operation conditions used in this work, the sintering does not contribute in an important way to the deactivation phenomenon. Similarly, the acidity which is an important factor in the formation of ethylene and coke is not the only property that determines the better resistance to carbon deposition on Ce catalyst. Liguras et al. have reported that the selectivity to ethylene in the ethanol reforming over Ni catalysts is almost independent of the acidity of supports taking into account that ethylene could be reformed under reaction conditions [5]. On NZA-Cex catalysts a low amount of ethylene is only observed at 400°C (Table 2). An analysis of catalytic performance and the characterization results lead to the conclusion that the reaction temperature and Ce content have an important effect in the carbon deposition. The carbon is deposited over the catalyst surface but does not cause a direct deactivation during 300min of time on stream used in this work. The presence of Ce modifies the relative amount of different carbon structures and promotes the formation of amorphous carbon (non-filaments) which is thermodynamically feasible to be removed at lower temperature. Thus, on the catalyst without Ce, filaments and graphitic structures are present at 500°C whereas non-significant amount of filaments is detected on samples with Ce (Raman and SEM observations). At this temperature the addition of 10% CeO2 into NiZnAl catalyst decreases the carbon formation by approximately 50%. At 700°C reactions generating and removing carbon occur in both catalysts with and without Ce but the amount of carbon is lower on catalysts with Ce. The gasification and Boudouard reactions which will continually remove carbon from the catalysts surface become significant at 700°C and the resistance to deactivation is also increased. The marked increase in CO formation is also an indication of the occurrence of these reactions. Experiments at long time on stream are necessary to study the resistance to deactivation at high temperature and to clarify the Ce effect."
9,Conclusions,"Catalytic systems based on Ni supported on ZnAl2O4 spinel phase modified by CeO2 have been prepared, achieving a specific interaction between the Ni and the modified support that results in good catalytic properties for ethanol steam reforming. The presence of CeO2 plays a fundamental role in modifying the relative amount of different carbon structures. The presence of Ce prevents the growth of carbon filaments and decreases the amount of carbon deposits. Besides, it promotes the formation of an amorphous carbon which is more reactive and easy to be removed by gasification and Boudouard reactions."
