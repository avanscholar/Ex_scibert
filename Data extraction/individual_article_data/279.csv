0,Introduction,"Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is one of the world’s most highly produced synthetic polymers for its large-scale applications [1,2]. The advantages of PVA include robust film-forming performance, excellent adhesive strength, and ideal emulsification ability [3–6]. Once PVA enters the end-of-pipe treatment, its advantages become disadvantageous, given that they are stable and difficult to degrade [7,8]. For example, in the textile industry, desizing wastewater contains 5−15 g/L of PVA and other organic pollutants. Its chemical oxygen demand (COD) value is often higher than 20,000 mg/L, which makes PVA the material responsible for nearly 70 % of the total COD discharge of the textile industry [9,10]. Effective techniques for treating ultra-high concentration PVA-contaminated wastewater are urgently needed. PVA polymer contains abundant hydroxyl groups, which are a strong source of hydrogen bonding. Because of the presence of hydrogen bonding, PVA chains assemble into supramolecular networks in water, preventing their degradation during wastewater treatment [11]. Although PVA is non-toxic to organisms, the BOD5:COD ratio of PVA-containing wastewater is often lower than 0.1, which is not suitable for biodegradation [12–14]. Oxidative degradation of PVA is also limited. To counteract the high molecular weight and the recalcitrant property of PVA polymer, large quantities of reagent should be used during wastewater treatment (Table 1) [15]. By comparison, technologies based on the ""aggregation/precipitation"" principle perform better both in terms of cost and processing efficiency. To date, the only technique that has been applied on a larger scale is the crosslinking/salting-out method proposed by Zimmermann et al. in the late 1970s [16]. It is a cost-effective and straightforward method, but its crosslinking and dehydration efficiency is limited; furthermore, this technique can no longer meet current production needs. Persulfates are famous oxidants in the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), which can effectively degrade various types of organic pollutants [17–20]. Besides, persulfates with higher concentrations can also initiate the free radical crosslinking of the polymeric chain, which is considered as one of the solutions for the pollution control of PVA. In the field of polymer materials, persulfate is one kind of free radical initiators for polymerization or crosslinking. For example, Gupta et al. synthesized a hydrogel by radical-induced crosslinking of PVA with potassium persulfate (PS) for dermal wound healing, while Riyajan et al. found that the swelling ratio of PVA noticeably decreased with crosslinking by PS [21,22]. The application of persulfates in polymer synthesis is often limited by the explosion polymerization and side reactions of oxidative degradation, attributing to its low activation energy. Interestingly, these problems happen to be the advantages in the treatment of polymer-containing wastewater. There are several reasons to expect that applying this technology will prove beneficial: (1) Persulfates can not only initiate free radical crosslinking but can also oxidize the hydroxyl group, which promotes the efficient crosslinking of PVA and weakens the water absorption capacity of precipitants [23]. (2) The strong oxidizing free radicals generated during the PVA crosslinking process are also suitable for the degradation of coexisting organic pollutants, such as dyes in the wastewater of textile industries, and are expected to facilitate the joint removal of multiple target pollutants. (3) This method is a simple process, as it merely involves the addition of PS to wastewater. Here, PS was chosen for the removal of PVA from wastewater. Desizing wastewater containing the high concentrations of PVA (10 g/L) and the coexisting dye contaminants is the object of treatment. The thermal activation was used to activate PS because desizing wastewater is often processed at high temperatures (70−80 °C) [24,25]. Specifically, we studied the performance of free radical-induced crosslinking of PVA and the production of free radicals and explored the critical factors controlling their efficacy. In addition, we verified the practical applicability of this method and proposed its possible underlying mechanism."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemical and materials,"2.1 Chemical and materials Analytical grade PVA (Fig. S1a) used in the experiment was 88 % hydrolyzed from polyvinyl acetate, and the molecular weight (Mw) ranges from 43,000 to 46,000 g/mol. The PVA had alcoholysis degrees of 50, 74–80, and 87–89 and viscosities of 20.5–24.5, 40–48, and 80−110 mPa·s were obtained from Aladdin, China. Potassium persulfate (PS, 99.5 %) and nitrobenzene were obtained from Macklin Reagent, China. C. I. Reactive Black 5 (RB5) and Rhodamine B (RhB) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, China. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) with the molecular weight of 8000 (Fig. S1b), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98 %), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), boric acid (H3BO3), potassium iodide (KI), iodine (I2), starch, Polyvinyl pyrrolidone K30, Na2SO4, Na2CO3, NaHCO3, KCl, CaCl2, MgSO4, methanol (99 %), ethanol (99 %), tert-butyl alcohol (98 %), and phenol were obtained from National Medicines, China. Doubly distilled water was used throughout the study."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure Simulated PVA-containing wastewater was prepared by dissolving 10 g/L PVA, 20 mg/L RB5 or 20 mg/L RhB into distilled water. Then it was continuously stirred for three hours at 70 °C. The crosslinking precipitation and oxidation processes proceeded in a beaker. PS was used as the initiator and oxidant. 0.1 mol/L H2SO4 or 0.1 mol/L NaOH was used to adjust the pH. Unless otherwise specified, the wastewater was directly treated without pH adjustment. The supernatant was withdrawn for PVA, COD, and decolouration analyses at various time intervals."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods PVA is colorless but it can form a blue complex with triiodide in the presence of boric acid. Thus, the concentration of PVA was measured as the following procedure. A total of 0.25 mL of PVA-containing solution, 1 mL KI-I2, and 5 mL boric acid solution were diluted to 25 mL and analyzed at a wavelength of 690 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-2401, Shimadzu, Japan) [26,27]. The decolorization of RB5/RhB was monitored with a UV–vis spectrophotometer by measuring the absorbance at the maximum wavelengths for RB5 dye (604 nm) and RhB dye (572 nm). In order to avoid the mutual interference between the dye and PVA in the measurement, when the concentrations of dyes were determined, the samples of wastewater were directly measured by UV–vis spectrophotometry without adding potassium iodide and boric acid, and when the concentration of PVA was determined, the samples of wastewater were diluted 100 times. Samples were taken and measured every 5 min. Measurements of COD were made using the closed reflux method (SM 5220 C) [28]. In the experiments with scavengers, the initial COD for the sample which contained scavengers was equal to the sum of the COD value of the wastewater and the COD value of the scavenger (Initial COD = CODwastewater + CODscavenger). Five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) measurement for the wastewater was done according to the American Public Health Association methods [29], using an oxygen meter (S400, Mettler Toledo, US). A minimum of five measurements were taken for each sample. Negative controls for each sample were determined by sample measurements using a bare working electrode. Reproducibility between three separately prepared electrodes was tested for the sample. For the ESR measurements, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolidine N-oxide (DMPO) was used as a spin trapping agent. 1 mL of solution after PVA crosslinking was added into the 1 mL of DMPO (16.67 mg/L). After stirring for 15 s, the mixture was sampled by a 100 μL capillary tube and then inserted into the ESR cavity (Bruker EMX-8/2.7C spectrometer). The ESR spectra were obtained at room temperature with a center field of 3442.5 G, a sweep width of 200 G, a sweep time of 45 s, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, a modulation amplitude of 0.5 G, a microwave frequency of 10 GHz, and a microwave power of 2.5 mW. Sulfate ions were measured by Dionex™ ICS-5000 ion chromatography (Thermo Fisher, USA) [30]. All measurements were made in triplicate."
5,Characterizations,"2.4 Characterizations The precipitation products of PVA and dyes were soaked in N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) solution for an hour and then pulverized in an agate mortar and dried for characterization and analysis. The chemical properties of precipitation products were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), which were used by a Thermo ESCALAB 250 electron spectrometer (Thermo Electron, US) and Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher, US) respectively. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was performed using a Bruker 500 MHz Ultrashield spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) with a 3.2 mm Bruker E-FreeTM MAS probe. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of crystallinity of precipitation products was using a D5005 diffractometer (Bruker, Germany). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Series Q500 instrument (TA, US) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 100 °C to 500 °C and an airflow rate of 100 mL/min. Contact angle (CA) was measured by SL200KS optical contact angle/interface tensiometer (Kruss, Germany). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was obtained from an HP Series Ⅱ Liquid Chromatograph with a PL-GPC50 SW column (GPC, US). The column temperature was 30 °C, and the flow rate was 1 mL/min. An aqueous solution of 0.1 mol/L of Na2SO4 and 0.1 mol/L of Na2HPO4 was used as eluent. Gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC–MS) was performed using a Finnigan Trace DSQ GC–MS instrument (Thermo Finnigan, USA) to measure the degradation products of PVA and coexisting pollutants. The detailed procedures were shown in Text S1 in the Supplementary Material [31]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,The efficient removal of PVA and coexisting dyes,"3.1 The efficient removal of PVA and coexisting dyes In a thermally activated PS system, PVA was rapidly crosslinked, precipitated, and could be easily separated from the wastewater (Fig. 1 ). The dyes in wastewater were also rapidly decoloured. In the presence of PS, 98.5 % of PVA was destroyed, and COD decreased from 14,160.0 mg/L to 792.9 mg/L with the removal rate of 94.4 % in 30 min at 70 °C. The physical photograph demonstrated that the PVA was crosslinked to form a brown mass. In contrast, neither high temperature nor strong acid treatment caused PVA to be crosslinked. In addition, the BOD5:COD ratio of the wastewater was also significantly improved after the treatment: specifically, the BOD5:COD ratio in the PVA wastewater increased by 12.9 times and that in the PVA-dye mixed wastewater increased by 10.0 times (Table S1). Four different types of PVA-containing wastewater were tested: wastewater from the desizing process of the dyeing factory and mixed wastewater from the dyeing factory, woollen blanket factory, and whalen silk factory. The characteristics of the different types of wastewater are shown in Table S2. Fig. 1 d shows that the removal of PVA and COD from desizing wastewater (No. 1) and mixed wastewater (No. 2) were greater than 96.3 % and 81.1 % after treatment by a thermally activated PS (16.0 g/L) system. The removal of PVA and COD from woollen blanket wastewater (No. 3) and whalen silk wastewater (No. 4) were more than 99.8 % and 95.7 % after treatment through the addition of 8.0 g/L of PS. Although the woollen blanket wastewater (No. 3) and whalen silk wastewater (No. 4) had higher values of COD, they were easier to treat than dyeing wastewater, which may have stemmed from their lower alkalinity and the fewer coexisting pollutants. In addition, the precipitate formed in actual wastewater was granulated, and the sedimentation effect was enhanced ( Fig. 1e), features different from those of simulated PVA wastewater. This difference likely stemmed from the different degrees of crosslinking of the polymer in the wastewater, which was related to both the properties of the wastewater and the nature of the coexisting contaminants. These important factors and reaction mechanisms will be examined in more detail below."
8,The generation of free radicals and the enhanced production of OH radicals,"3.2 The generation of free radicals and the enhanced production of OH radicals PS is widely used because it is an efficient oxidant in AOPs, but it is also a well-known free radical initiator under controlled radical crosslinking [32]. When the concentration of PS was high enough (>8.0 g/L in this study), the free radicals generated from PS can remove hydrogen atoms from the polymer backbone, resulting in the initiation of crosslinking from the polymer radicals [33]. There were three different types of free radicals that were detected during the precipitation of PVA crosslinking by thermal activation of PS (Fig. 2 a). The signal of DMPO -SO4 − (αN = 15.34 G, αH β = 10.16 G, αH1 γ = 1.66 G, and αH2 γ = 0.91 G) was weak, while the signal with the strongest intensity accounted for the typical signal of the DMPO −OH adduct (the peak strength of 1:2:2:1, the hyperfine coupling constants of αN = 14.82 G and αH β = 14.82 G), which were produced by the thermal activation of PS as shown in Eq. 1–2. (1) S 2 O 8 2 − ⟶ Δ 2 S O 4 • − (2) 2SO4 − + H2O → SO4 2− + OH + H+ The sextet signal with the hyperfine coupling parameters αN = 15.24 G and αβ H = 22.83 G was assigned to the DMPO adducts of carbon-based radicals (DMPO -R), which was responsible for the PVA crosslinking initiated from the polymer radicals. Previous studies have shown that radicals attack the carbon backbone of PVA, producing two kinds of carbon radicals (Radical 1 and Radical 2) according to Eq. 3–4 [22,34]. The PVA-based carbon radicals continue to react with each other, producing the crosslinking product. (3) (4) Importantly, Fig. 2 a and b show that the presence of PVA significantly enhanced the intensity of the OH radical in thermally activated PS systems. According to a previous study, these OH radicals might originate from the elimination of the PVA polymer [34]. To confirm this suspicion, PVA with different alcoholysis degrees (1788 and 1750) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), which contains different proportion of −OH groups (88 %, 50 %, and 0%), was used to compare the production of OH radicals in a thermally activated PS system. The intensity of the OH radical in the thermally activated PS system was indeed positively related to the amount of −OH groups in the PVA polymer ( Fig. 2a, Fig. 2 c, and Fig. 2d). Thus, we considered the possibility that PVA enhances the production of OH radicals in thermally activated PS systems. In cases where there was considerable elimination of hydroxyl groups, the reactions may lead to the liberation of unsaturated alkenes, aldehydes, ketones, and random scission (Eq. 5–7), which would have further promoted the crosslinking of PVA and prevented the precipitants from absorbing water [34]. Meanwhile, the oxidants with weaker oxidative properties such as oxygen would also interact with the carbon radicals of PVA to generate O − radicals as well as the polymers containing unsaturated structures (Eq. 8–9) [22,34]. And the conversion of O − into ⋅OH proceed via Eq. 10 [35]. This catalyst-like function of PVA, which accelerated the production of OH radicals, would further affect itself by promoting its crosslinking-induced precipitation or facilitate the simultaneous degradation of coexisting pollutants. (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) H 2 O + O • − ⇌ • OH + O H − Further, phenol (PHE), nitrobenzene (NB), ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MeOH), and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) were used for scavenging the radicals. PHE can react with both SO4 − and OHat high rates (i.e., rate constant >109 /M s, Table S3) [36]. Indeed, PHE could completely inhibit both crosslinking precipitation and the oxidative destruction of PVA (Fig. 2 e–f). By comparison, the scavenging rate of NB for OH radicals [(3.0–3.9)×109 /M s] was close to that of PHE (6.6 × 109 /M s), but its scavenging rate for SO4 − radicals (<106 /M s) was only ten-thousandth of that of PHE (8.8 × 109 /M s). The scavenging efficiency of NB for PVA crosslinking was significantly lower than that of phenol, with a PVA removal rate of 97.8 % and a COD removal rate of 40.4 %. The actual reaction photos revealed that the PVA in the solution was milky white and turbid, indicating that although the PVA was not crosslinked to a massive precipitate, it likely crosslinked to form microparticles. The quenching efficiency of the other three scavengers was consistent with the magnitude of their reaction rate with OH radicals. Therefore, we further confirmed that both OH and SO4 − radicals were able to initiate the crosslinking of PVA, but the larger numbers of OH radicals made a greater relative contribution."
9,The crosslinking precipitation of PVA,"3.3 The crosslinking precipitation of PVA XPS and FTIR revealed that the precipitation products of PVA contained structures, such as aldehydes and ketones, and produced structures, such as COC , as a result of crosslinking. As shown in the XPS C1s spectra (Fig. 3 a), initial PVA had four types of carbon bonds corresponding to C _ − C O − O (284.6 eV), CO (286.3 eV), C _ − C O − O (285.8 eV), and OC O (289.0 eV), which were derived from the main PVA chain, the side chain hydroxyl, and the unalcoholized acetate [24,25]. After crosslinking, the characteristic peak of appeared at 287.6 eV, and the peak of C _ − C O − O and OC O increased, indicating the oxidation of −OH groups and the crosslinking of PVA. The XPS O1s spectra reflected the same phenomenon (Fig. S2) The FTIR spectrum of the initial PVA showed the strong OH stretching vibration at 3420 cm−1 and the weak COC stretching at 1095 cm−1. The band at 1728 cm−1 and 1270 cm−1 represented the CO stretching the COH out-of-plane vibration (Fig. 3b). In the precipitation products of PVA, the stretching vibration strength of the OH bond (3240 cm−1) clearly decreased, and the tensile strength of the COC bond (1095 cm−1) increased. Meanwhile, 13C-NMR analyses confirmed the presence of unsaturated CC structure in the precipitation product of PVA (Fig. 3c). Comparing the spectra of the initial PVA, the newly appeared peak near the chemical shift of 100 ppm possessed a CC structure, while the splitting of the characteristic methylene (−CH2) peak and the merging of the methine characteristic peak (−CH) indicated that the chain structure of PVA had been rearranged during crosslinking and that the polymers were partially oxidized. Since the characteristic −CH2 peak was split into three peaks, there were primarily two forms of −CH2 in addition to linking to the secondary alcohol, which were generated by a different means of crosslinking. Additionally, the decrease in crystallinity and the increase in thermal stability further demonstrated that PVA was effectively crosslinked by the free radical crosslinking (Fig. 3 d-e). All these results indicate that the thermally activated PS system not only caused the crosslinking of PVA but also oxidized the hydroxyl groups in PVA, which are consistent with the derivation of the free radical reaction mechanism. The high moisture uptake capacity of PVA, originating from the hydroxyl groups in the repeating unit of PVA, restricts its dehydration efficiency in wastewater treatment. Thus, the water content of PVA precipitant was also investigated, which was calculated as follow (Eq. 11): (11) W C = W 1 − W 2 W 1 × 100 % where W1 is the weight of PVA precipitant and W2 is the weight of PVA precipitant under 105 °C drying to constant weight. The result was shown in Table S4, which the water content of the PVA precipitant was only about 78 %. According to the published study, the chemical crosslinking can enhance the water-resistant ability of PVA due to the modification of −OH group and the stronger intermolecular interaction between polymer chains [37]. Additionally, when PVA was efficiently crosslinked, its contact angle increased from 42.02° to 74.38°, which further confirmed the weakened hydrophilicity (Fig. S3). The effective crosslinking and the partial oxidation of −OH groups reduced the hydrophilicity of PVA, which was also an important reason for its rapid precipitation and low water content. With the increase in unsaturated structures, such as C = C and C = O, PVA can be partially degraded by free radicals with high oxidative activity. The molecular fragments of PVA with a molecular weight around 1650 appeared in solution when the reaction time was 30 s, and they gradually accumulated as the reaction time increased (Fig. 3f). After 1 min of the reaction, a large number of small molecules with a Mw of approximately 142 were rapidly generated in the solution and then disappeared (inset of Fig. 3f). These small molecules might have been rapidly mineralized, but the PVA molecular fragments with a Mw around 1000 were stable after 3 h of the treatment and eventually became the main component of the final COD residue (Fig. S4). These fragments primarily consisted of long-chain fatty acids, such as n-Hexadecanoic acid according to the GC–MS analysis (Table S5). This part of the PVA fragments generated a certain amount of COD residue, but this residual ratio was relatively small relative to the precipitated portion."
10,The oxidative degradation of coexisting dyes,"3.4 The oxidative degradation of coexisting dyes Activated persulfate reactions have widespread applications in wastewater treatment, and the results of several studies have confirmed that these reactions could effectively destroy the chromophore of dyes [38]. However, in the presence of high concentrations of polymers, the decolorization effect of thermally activated PS systems on dyes has been rarely reported. At 70 °C, the decolorization of RB5 was completed within 20 min and its efficiency clearly increased when the dosage of PS increased from 0.5 to 8.0 g/L (Fig. 4 a). After the PVA concentration increased from 0.1 g to 10 g/L, there was no significant negative effect on the decolorization of the RB5 (Fig. 4b). The physical images ( Fig. 1e) also revealed that after the mixed wastewater of PVA and dye were treated, neither the solution nor the precipitate had the characteristic color of the dye. In addition to the sulfate and hydroxyl radical, another sextet signal different from that for PVA radicals was observed in dye-degraded bodies, whose hyperfine coupling parameters were αN = 15.39 G and αβ H = 22.76 G (Fig. 4 c–d). This signal might be attributed to the organic radicals that were created by RB5 before decomposition. Importantly, the presence of high concentrations of PVA significantly enhanced the strength of hydroxyl radicals in the dye degradation system. As previously mentioned (Eq. 8–10), PVA could enhance the production of OH radicals in thermally activated PS systems, and the enhanced part of OH radicals would further affect the PVA or coexisting dyes. This observation explains why RB5 can still be efficiently decolored in the presence of high concentrations of PVA. Additionally, XPS and FTIR showed that there was no significant difference between the crosslinked precipitated products produced by the dye and the PVA-mixed wastewater and even when PVA was crosslinked alone (Fig. 4e-f). Meanwhile, a small number of degradation products, such as terephthalic acid, glutaric acid, and formic acid, can be detected in the aqueous solution (Table S5), indicating that the interaction between the colorless degradation product of RB5 and the crosslinked product of PVA was minimal."
11,Important factors in the simultaneous removal of PVA and RB5,"3.5 Important factors in the simultaneous removal of PVA and RB5 Fig. 5 shows the important factors underlying the crosslinking precipitation of PVA and the decolorization of RB5. The removal efficiency of PVA, COD, and color increased as the dosage of PS increased (Fig. 5 a-c). At the optimum dosage of PS (i.e., 8.0 g/L in terms of cost), the removal efficiency of PVA, COD, and color was 97.9 %, 93.5 %, and 100.0 %, respectively. These results also indicated that the crosslinking precipitation of PVA required more PS dosage than dye decolorization. When the dosage was less than 6.0 g/L, crosslinking precipitation cannot be performed, and the decolorization efficiency of the dye was less affected. The effect of temperature on the synergistic treatment of the PVA and dye was consistent with this (Fig. 5 d–f). For thermal activation of S2O8 2−, the energy input from high temperature (>50 °C) can cause the fission of OO bonds to form the sulfate radicals. This increase in temperature will also promote the transformation of SO4 - radicals to OH radicals. The dye can be significantly decolored when the heat activation temperature reaches 50 °C, while the crosslinking precipitation of PVA requires an activation temperature of 70 °C or more. Because PVA-sized fabrics must be subjected to washing with hot water with chemical agents to effectively remove the size before the dyeing process, desizing wastewater is common at high temperatures (70−80 °C). Fig. 5 g-i presents the performance of PVA and color removal at various pH levels. Consistent with previous work, the decolorization of the dye used in this study was nearly unaffected by changes in pH. However, the crosslinking precipitation of PVA was dependent on pH, as the reaction remained constant within an initial pH range of 2–6 but noticeably decreased when the pH was greater than 7. Because the reaction rate of radical hydrogen abstraction decreased as the pH increased, the limitation of PVA crosslinking initiated by the polymer radicals was further restricted [39]. When PVA existed in isolation and when PVA and the cationic dye RhB were present, the effects of PS dosage, reaction temperature, and reaction pH on the removal effect of simulated wastewater COD, PVA, and chromaticity were consistent (Fig. S5-S6)."
12,Important factors affecting practical applications,"3.6 Important factors affecting practical applications Because of the complex composition of textile wastewater, we also explored different factors affecting the removal efficiency of PVA in actual wastewater (Fig. 6). According to the requirements of different processes, the concentration of PVA in wastewater varied widely. In addition, the degree of alcoholysis and viscosity of PVA were also different. Specifically, the concentration of PVA in wastewater was greater than 2.0 g/L, and the viscosity of PVA ranged from 20.5 to 110 mPa.s. Thus, this method has broad applicability, and the removal rate of COD can be greater than 91.5 %. Although the increase in the degree of alcoholysis will increase the water absorption of PVA, the COD removal rate of PVA wastewater significantly improved as the degree of alcoholysis increased. The primary reason explaining this pattern was that during the free radical crosslinking process of PVA, OH radicals were generated by the elimination of −OH groups, which further strengthened the crosslinking process (Fig. 2a, c, and d). As a sizing agent, starch is generally mixed with PVA in desizing wastewater [40]. Meanwhile, polyvinyl pyrrolidone K30 (K30) has a strong affinity with common organic dyes to improve the dyeability of hydrophobic synthetic fibers. Therefore, it is often used in printing and dyeing auxiliaries in wastewater. Fig. 6d-e shows the removal efficiency of PVA by the different concentrations of starch and K30. The COD removal rate of K30 had no significant effect on the process, as the removal rate of starch declined. This finding indicated that the presence of starch reduced the removal efficiency of PVA and that K30 had little effect on the process. When the starch content in the desizing wastewater is high, other treatment methods need to be considered. Finally, the additives contained a large amount of salt in the printing and dyeing process. Fig. 6f explores the removal effect of PVA under coexisting ions, showing that K30 does not affect the removal of PVA as the COD removal rate was greater than 90 % when different ions of salt were added. Additionally, the production of SO4 2− in the thermally activated PS system has been measured by ion chromatography. As shown in Fig. S7, only less than 1 mmol/L of SO4 2− was formed in the first 5 min of the reaction, while the accumulation of SO4 2− increased rapidly after 5−10 min and tended to balance. It was consistent with the change law of wastewater COD value (Fig. 1b), which further shows that the crosslinking of PVA and the decolorization of dyes depended on the decomposition of potassium persulfate. Combined with the analysis results of the ESR (Fig. 2), a large number of free radicals accumulated at 30 s of reaction and begin to decay at 5 min. Therefore, it can be deduced that free radicals generated by thermally activated of PS mainly occurred within 5 min of the beginning of the reaction. After that, PVA began to crosslink and precipitate, and the SO4 − radicals were quenched to form SO4 2-. After 30 min of reaction, most of the PVA in the wastewater was removed, but PS was almost completely decomposed into SO4 2− and accumulated in the wastewater. Although SO4 2- is a common and nontoxic constituent of natural waters and wastewaters, the high concentrations of SO4 2- can cause the corrosion of reinforced steel, the scaling of equipment, and the damage to mammals [41]. In addition, it also has negative impacts on the anaerobic digestion process in wastewater treatment, which are related to generation of sulfides, loss of electrons (and hence methane), and contamination of gas streams [42]. Thus, in future research, we need to pay attention to further optimizing this treatment system, such as reducing the dosage of PS as much as possible to avoid the generation of sulfate ions, or coupling with chemical precipitation technology to eliminate the excessive sulfate ions."
13,The proposed mechanism,"3.7 The proposed mechanism In the thermally activated PS system that we have developed, when the PS dosage was greater than 8.0 g/L and the activation temperature was greater than 70 °C, the PVA in the wastewater can be effectively crosslinked and precipitated (Fig. 1). XPS, FTIR, and NMR showed that the precipitates in water had abundant COC, CC, and CO groups, while the OH groups were significantly reduced compared with PVA (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that the thermally activated PS system not only induced the crosslinking of PVA but also oxidized the hydroxyl groups in PVA, effectively reducing the ability of the precipitates to absorb water. In this system, the production of SO4 −, ⋅OH, and carbon-based radicals was detected by ESR analysis. By combining the published mechanism on radical-induced crosslinking and the structure of the precipitate, we concluded that the thermal activation of PS produced SO4 − and ⋅OH radicals that attacked the carbon backbone of PVA and produced the carbon-based radicals of PVA. The carbon-based radicals continued to react together and produced the crosslinking product. In cases where considerable elimination of hydroxyl groups occurred, the reactions led to the liberation of unsaturated alkenes, aldehydes, and ketones (Fig. 7 ). Importantly, in thermally activated PS systems, the presence of PVA could promote the production of OH radicals that originated from the elimination of the −OH groups of the PVA polymer. The enhanced production of OH radicals is not only capable of promoting the crosslinking precipitation of PVA itself but also facilitating the simultaneous degradation of coexisting pollutants in wastewater. The dye removal experiments indicated that the decolorizations of RB5 and RhB were completed within 20 min at 70 °C and that PVA did not have a significant negative effect on the decolorization of the dyes when its concentration was increased from 0.1 g to 10 g/L (Fig. 4). Based on the discussion of the factors affecting crosslinking precipitation and decolorization, the dye can be significantly decolored at high temperatures (>50 °C), while the crosslinking precipitation of PVA requires an activation temperature of 70 °C or more. Dye decolorization was not affected by pH changes and the radical hydrogen abstraction can promote crosslinking precipitation of PVA under acidic conditions (Fig. 5). Finally, different components of PVA, starch, K30, and saline ions were contained in wastewater. We found that the removal effect increased under higher concentrations of PVA and degrees of alcoholysis. Viscosity, K30, and saline ions did not affect the removal effect of PVA, while starch had the opposite effect (Fig. 6)."
14,Conclusion,"In this study, the method of a free radical-induced crosslinking and oxidation initiated by thermally activated PS was proposed for the simultaneous removal of PVA and coexisting organic pollutants from wastewater. The advantages of PS for PVA wastewater treatment are: (1) As a crosslinking agent, it can induce the generation of PVA carbon radicals and promote the effective crosslinking. (2) As a strong oxidant, it can oxidize the hydroxyl groups in PVA to reduce the water absorption of precipitants as well as degrade the coexisting pollutants. (3) The elimination of −OH groups of the PVA polymer could enhance the production of OH radicals. This catalyst-like function can promote the crosslinking of PVA itself and facilitate the simultaneous degradation of coexisting pollutants. Under optimal conditions, the maximum removal efficiencies of COD, PVA, and color attained 93.6 %, 98.4 %, and 100.0 %. This technically highly efficient, and cost-effective process is attractive, and provides new insights of the treatment of wastewater containing high concentrations of soluble polymers."
