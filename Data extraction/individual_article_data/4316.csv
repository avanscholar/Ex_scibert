0,Introduction,"The world’s energy crisis is a major problem of the 21st century, and the pollutants released from the combustion of fossil fuels are also alarming [1,2]. Thus, the access to clean energy supplies has become increasingly urgent [3]. To satisfy the energy demand, substantial efforts have been devoted to developing clean and renewable energy resources and reliable energy storage and conversion devices. Rechargeable batteries are one of the most successful technologies that can repeatedly generate electricity from energy storage materials [4–8]. As an advanced battery technology, nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries demonstrate strong application potentials in new-energy vehicles, power tools, modern military devices, etc. owing to their key advantages such as high safety, wide application temperature, environmentally compatibility, recyclability, etc.[8,9]. For Ni-MH batteries, the negative electrode materials—hydrogen storage alloys (HSAs) dominate the batteries’ electrochemical performance [1,10]. At present, there are two relatively mature negative electrode materials which are rare earth-based AB5-type and Ti-/Zr-based AB2-type HSAs. However, the maximum discharge capacity of commercial AB5-type alloys is only 350 mAh g−1, which does not satisfy the requirement for high energy density [8,9]. AB2-type HSAs suffer from slow activation and poor rate discharge performance due to their easy surface passivation and high hydride stability [9,11]. In the last decade, a novel kind of HSAs—AB3.0–4.0-type superlattice alloys were developed, where ‘A’ represents La-based rare earth elements and Mg, and ‘B’ represents Ni-based transitional metals. Typical phases in these alloys have superlattice structures composed of [A2B4] and [AB5] sublattices alternatively stacking along c axis such as AB3-type phase (A2B4 + AB5 = 3 × AB3), A2B7-type phase (A2B4 + 2AB5 = 2 × A2B7) and A5B19-type phase (A2B4 + 3AB5 = A5B19) [12] as shown in Fig. 1 (a). These two kinds of sublattices first stack into blocks in the above ratios, and two (2H-type, Z = 2) or three (3R-type, Z = 3) blocks further stack into a crystal cell [13]. The co-existence of both [A2B4] and [AB5] sublattices gifts this alloy system both good activation performance from AB5-type structure and high energy density from AB2-type structure [14,15]. Thus they are considered as one of the most promising next-generation negative electrode materials for high-energy and high-power Ni-MH batteries [16,17]. However, the complex stacking structure of the superlattice alloys also brings an adverse effect on their structure stability. Studies have shown that the asynchronous sublattice expansion/contraction of [A2B4] and [AB5] during H absorption/desorption results in substantial microstrain on the interface between them (Fig. 1(b)), which is one of the most important causes leading to their structure failure [18]. The [A2B4] sublattices with larger lattice volume have lower H absorption/desorption plateau pressure than the [AB5] sublattices. Therefore, they absorb H earlier than the [AB5] sublattices in the charge process and desorb H later in the discharge process, resulting in the asynchronous expansion/contraction of [AB5] and [A2B4] sublattices. Therefore, the asynchronous lattice expansion/contraction is actually originated from the different volume sizes between [AB5] and [A2B4] sublattices of the as-prepared alloys. So coordinating the volume sizes of these two kinds of sublattices is a key solution to overcome the issue of structure instability. But very few studies have attempted to improve the alloys’ properties from this perspective so far. In addition to the alloys’ crystal structure, the oxidation/corrosion consumption of the active materials is another important factor that aggravates the cycling degradation of HSAs [2,19,20]. In a half-cell test of a Ni-MH battery, the alloy electrodes are immersed in a strong oxidizing electrolyte (6 M KOH), which results in the irreversible formation of oxides or hydroxides on the alloy surface. Reports have shown that for the rare-earth based metal hydride alloys, the oxidation/corrosion products are mainly hydroxides from the precipitation of rare-earth ions growing on the alloy/electrolyte interface as shown in Fig. 1(c) [19]. Considering the high content of rare-earth elements and the inclusion of high-reactive Mg element of superlattcie alloys compared with AB5-type alloys, the impact of oxidation/corrosion on their cycle life should be greater. Therefore, how to enhance the oxidation/corrosion resistance is another important issue that needs to be solved. In this work, a new strategy is proposed for improving the cycling stability of superlattice HSAs by enhancing the alloys’ structure stabilization and oxidation/corrosion resistance. The rationale of the idea is based on the alloys’ structure characteristics analysis and the Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations, and is also verified by experimental results. The new strategy provides a promising solution for enhancing the cycling stability of superlattice alloys and paves the way for their practical applications."
1,Theoretical analysis and the First-principles calculation for alloy design,
2,Theoretical analysis,"2.1 Theoretical analysis Among AB3-, A2B7-, and A5B19-type superlattice alloys, A2B7-type La–Mg–Ni-based alloys possess the best overall electrochemical performance and are the mostly studied alloy type [21,22]. Therefore, we choose the A2B7-type (La,Mg)2Ni7 alloy as the pristine study model. The basic idea of this research can be transplanted to other types of superlattice alloys. It is know that the ternary La–Mg–Ni-based alloys are originated from the binary La–Ni-based alloys [23]. For the La2Ni7 alloy, due to its substantial volume difference between [La2Ni4] and [LaNi5] sublattices (V [La2Ni4] = 96.35 Å3; V [LaNi5] = 87.96 ~ 89.42 Å3 [24,25]), hydrogen atoms only enter the [La2Ni4] sublattices or the boundary between them. Thus, upon hydrogenation, a significant volume expansion of the [La2Ni4] sublattices (47.7%) is introduced, while little expansion or even contraction occurs to the [LaNi5] sublattices [24,26]. The different hydrogenation behaviors between [La2Ni4] and [LaNi5] sublattices cause significant microstrain at the interface connecting them, which leads to the pulverization/amorphization of the alloys [27,28]. The crystal structure failure inevitably causes serious capacity loss within very few cycles. This situation is greatly improved by the introduction of a third element Mg into the alloy to partially replace La. Mg atom has smaller atomic radius (1.50 Å) than that of La (1.87 Å) and therefore exclusively enters [La2Ni4] sublattices where La–La bonds are shorter. The change in the sublattice compositions from [La2Ni4] to [(La,Mg)2Ni4] decreases the sublattice volume of [A2B4] (V [A2B4]) and thus makes it closer to that of [AB5] (V [AB5]). The close V [A2B4] (89.01 Å3) and V [AB5] (87.62 ~ 88.57 Å3) enables [AB5] sublattices to also absorb hydrogen, which reduces the volume size difference between [A2B4] and [AB5] sublattices upon hydrogenation and lowers the alloys’ internal microstrain [24]. However, even though the Mg solubility of the [A2B4] sublattices reaches the highest level (LaMgNi4), the [A2B4] sublattices are still larger than the [AB5] sublattices [18,24]. To further equalize [LaMgNi4] and [LaNi5] sublattices, the sublattice volume of [LaMgNi4] needs to be further reduced. For realizing this goal, we consider that the rare-earth elements with smaller atomic radii than that of La could be utilized to further partially replace La in the [LaMgNi4] sublattices. The atomic radii of different lanthanide series rare-earth elements are shown in Fig. 1(d). It is seen that the atomic radius decreases from left to right except for Eu and Yb. Pm has a very small radius but it is an artificial element. Therefore, the elements in the dark yellow frame are possible candidates. Next we consider the other important factor of cycle life—oxidation/corrosion. As most of the electrochemical corrosion products of La–Mg–Ni-based alloys are La(OH)3 and Mg(OH)2 [19,20], if we suppress the oxidation/corrosion behavior of La/Mg while stabilizing the crystal structure, a better effect can be expected. It has been proposed that electronegativity (χ) is an important parameter to characterize an element’s corrosion resistance [2,29]. It has also been found that the change tendency of χ is approximately consistent with the reactivity, meaning that the elements with larger χ values have lower reactivity and better corrosion resistance. Therefore, the rare-earth elements with large χ values are preferred candidates. From Fig. 1(d) it is seen that Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er and Tm have significantly higher χ values than the other elements. But the atomic radius of Eu is larger than that of La, which rules it out, leaving the possible choices Gd, Dy, Ho, Er and Tm. Considering the higher availability and lower relative atomic mass, we choose Gd to partially replace La in this work. Since the purpose of the present study is to offer a feasible strategy and reveal its function mechanism, no other substitution elements than Gd are simultaneously added to the La–Mg–Ni-based alloy samples to minimize the interference and uncertainties."
3,First-principles calculation,"2.2 First-principles calculation The expected effect of Gd is to decrease the volume difference between [A2B4] and [AB5] sublattices. To validate this effect and determine the optimum amount of Gd substitution for La, we performed DFT simulations based on a 2 × 2 × 1 crystal cell containing (24-x)La, (x)Gd, (8)Mg and (112)Ni. Detailed calculations (Fig. S1, Table S1, and related discussion in Supplementary Material) show that Gd preferentially replaces La in the [A2B4] sublattices rather than the [AB5] sublattices. This selective atomic occupation of Gd between [A2B4] and [AB5] is also due to the shorter A − A bonds of the [A2B4] sublattices. Therefore, the crystal structure models as shown in Fig. 2 (a1)−(a3) are built and the number of Gd atoms are tentatively chosen to be 3 (Fig. 2(a1)), 4 (Fig. 2(a2)) and 5 (Fig. 2(a3)). Fig. 2(b) shows that both [A2B4] and [AB5] sublattices shrink with increasing Gd ratio, but the change rate of [A2B4] is faster, which ultimately reduces the volume difference between [A2B4] and [AB5] (ΔV [A2B4]−[AB5]) (Fig. 2(c)). The Gd atom number (x) and ΔV [A2B4]−[AB5] reveal a linear relationship as shown in Fig. 2(c), where an x value of 4.787 is acquired when ΔV [A2B4]−[AB5] is zero. Therefore, the calculated nominal composition of the alloy is La19.213Gd4.787Mg8Ni112 (La0.6004Gd0.1496Mg0.25Ni3.5). Based on the above results, a candidate alloy La0.6Gd0.15Mg0.25Ni3.5 was designed and synthesized to investigate its cycling stability and structure changes with cycling. Alloys with elemental compositions of La0.7Gd0.05Mg0.25Ni3.5 and La0.65Gd0.10Mg0.25Ni3.5 as well as a pristine alloy La0.75Mg0.25Ni3.5 were also prepared and studied for comparison."
4,Experimental,
5,Synthesis of alloys,"3.1 Synthesis of alloys The as-cast La0.75− x Gd x Mg0.25Ni3.5 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) alloys were prepared by inductive melting La, Gd, Mg and Ni metals under a high-purity argon atmosphere. All elements were of purity higher than 99.5%. To compensate for the melting loss including volatilization loss, oxidation loss, etc., excess amount of La, Gd and Mg elements were added. To prepare the single-phase alloys from the as-cast ones, a block of about 6–7 g was knocked off from each as-cast alloy ingot, wrapped in a piece of Ta foil and sealed in a Ni shell as shown in Fig. S2. Then the alloy blocks were put into a tube furnace for annealing. The heating schemes are shown in Fig. S2. From room temperature (RT) to 873 K, the heating rate was 5 K min−1, after which the temperature was increased to 1223 K, 1263 K, 1273 K and 1283 K for the alloys with x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15, respectively at 1 K min−1 and kept for 12 h. The cooling rate from target temperatures to 773 K was 5 K min−1 and then the furnace was turned off, cooling the samples to RT inside the furnace. The elemental compositions of the alloys were examined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) which agree well with the nominal compositions (Table S2)."
6,Structure characterization,"3.2 Structure characterization The crystal structure of the alloys was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Three kinds of sample powder were characterized by XRD: as-synthesized alloy powder, alloy powder at different charge/discharge depths within one cycle and discharged alloy powder after different cycles. For preparing the as-synthesized alloy powder, the alloys were crushed and ground to less than 300 mesh. For preparing the specimens at various charge/discharge depths, the alloy powder of 200–400 mesh was made into electrodes without conductive agent which were activated for 3 cycles. Then the alloy electrodes were left standing for 30 min at each charge/discharge depth of 0, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% before being taken to the XRD measurement. To prepare the alloy specimens of different cycles, the alloy powder was made into electrodes which were charged and discharged at 1C until the target cycles. The XRD measurements were carried out on a D8 ADVANCE type X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The phase compositions and particle morphologies of the alloys were studied using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800) in a backscattered electron (BSE) mode. The SEM was connected with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) to get the elemental compositions and distributions. For the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement, the specimens were prepared by mechanical grounding in alcohol until the particles suspended in the alcohol. The specimen-liquid system was ultrasounded for 30 min before being taken to the TEM measurements which were performed on a Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN TEM. The particle morphologies, high-resolution transmission patterns and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were acquired from TEM. The Raman spectra of the cycled alloy powder were obtained on a Renishaw in Via Raman spectrometer at room temperature. The preparation of the specimens was the same with that for the XRD measurement."
7,Electrochemical measurements,"3.3 Electrochemical measurements The La0.75− x Gd x Mg0.25Ni3.5 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) alloy electrodes were prepared by cold pressing the mixture of 0.10 g alloy powder and 0.50 g carbonyl nickel powder into pellets under the pressure of 15 MPa. The electrochemical measurements were performed in a tri-electrode open cell consisting of a M/MH negative electrode, a sintered Ni(OH)2/NiOOH positive electrode and a Hg/HgO reference electrode. The electrolyte was 6 M KOH solution. For activation, the batteries were charged at 60 mA g−1 for 8 h and then discharged at the same current density to a cut-off potential of − 0.60 V (vs. Hg/HgO). After activation, the discharge capacity was recorded every 20 cycles to study the cycling stability of the alloy electrodes. For the high rate dischargeability (HRD) measurement, the batteries were fully charged at a current density of 60 mA g−1 and then discharged at the current densities of 60, 300, 600, 900, 1200 and 1500 mA g−1. All the tests were performed at 298 K. The Tafel polarization curves were measured by using a CHI660 electrochemical workstation at 298 K. The preparation of the alloy electrodes was referred to reference [10]. A tri-electrode system was used for the measurement with M/MH as the working electrode, Ni(OH)2/NiOOH as the counter electrode, and Hg/HgO as the reference electrode. The measurement was carried out by scanning the electrodes from a potential of − 0.4 to 0.1 V (vs. Hg/HgO) at the rate of 1 mV s−1."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Microstructure,"4.1 Microstructure Fig. 3 (a) shows the XRD patterns of the La0.75− x Gd x Mg0.25Ni3.5 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) alloys. All the XRD peaks are indexed to a hexagonal 2H-type (La,Mg)2Ni7 phase structure with a space group of P6/mmm. The peaks are sharp, indicating good crystallinity. With the increase of Gd content, the XRD peaks shift toward higher angle as seen in the zoom-in XRD patterns in Fig. 3(b), suggesting the decrease in cell volume. Fig. 3(c) exhibits the SEM image of the x = 0.15 alloy, and the entire area only has one color with the element composition of La0.603Gd0.153Mg0.244Ni3.492, corresponding to the A2B7-type phase. EDS mappings in Fig. 3(d)–(g) confirm the homogeneous distributions of La, Gd, Mg and Ni elements. The high-resolution TEM image in Fig. 3(h) shows a three-layer superlattice structure consisting of one [A2B4] layer and two [AB5] layers, corresponding to the crystal model in Fig. 3(i). The length and width of one block ([A2B4] + 2[AB5]) are 0.531 and 1.212 nm, respectively, resulting in the cell parameters of a = b = 0.531 nm and c = 1.212 × 2 = 2.424 nm. The SAED pattern in Fig. 3(j) exhibits a single-crystalline characteristics, where the (012), (003) and (015) lattice planes correspond to the three XRD peaks at ca. 21.6°, 22.0° and 27.5° in Fig. 3(a), respectively. The above results validate the successful preparation of the A2B7-type single-phase alloy samples. The XRD patterns were refined using Rietveld method, and the detailed crystal lattice information is summarized in Table 1 . With the increase of Gd content, the lattice parameters and cell volumes decrease, which agrees with the peak shift in Fig. 3(b). The anisotropic values of c/a do not show evident difference. In particular, from the atomic coordinates (Tables S3–S6 in Supplementary Material), the V [A2B4] and V [AB5] values are determined as listed in the 6th and 7th columns of Table 1. It is seen that the V [A2B4] values are larger than the V [AB5] values for all the alloys. The substitution of Gd for La decreases the volumes of both sublattices, but the decreasing effect on V [A2B4] is more evident, thus reducing the ΔV [A2B4]−[AB5] values. The above results echo with the First-principles calculation results that Gd tends to replace La in the [A2B4] sublattices as well as the changing trends of the sublattice volumes in Fig. 2(b)–(c). Note that V [A2B4] and V [AB5] become almost equal when x increases to 0.15. This is in good accordance with Fig. 2(c), and validates the successful design and synthesize of the alloy."
10,Electrochemical performance,"4.2 Electrochemical performance Fig. 4 (a) plots the discharge capacity of the La0.75− x Gd x Mg0.25Ni3.5 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) alloy electrodes within 100 cycles. The information is summarized in Table 2 . All the alloys are easily activated after 2 cycles. The maximum discharge capacities (C max) are 391, 388, 389 and 386 mAh g−1 for the x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 alloy electrodes, respectively which are very close to each other because they have the same single-phase crystal structure and hydrogen occupation sites. Seen from Fig. 4(a), degradation occurs after activation reflected from the decrease in the discharge capacity with cycling. But the slopes become gentler with increasing x from 0 to 0.15. Correspondingly, the capacity retention of the alloy electrodes at the 100th cycle (S 100) increases from 82.1% (x = 0) to 88.2% (x = 0.15) as shown in Table 2. Fig. 4(b) shows the high rate dischargeability (HRD) curves of the alloy electrodes. The HRD values at each discharge current density exhibit an increasing trend when x increases from 0 to 0.15. This can be attributed to the reduction of the cell volumes which results in higher hydrogen desorption plateau pressure. The above electrochemical results suggest that the alloy modification idea in the present study enhances the cycle life of the alloy electrodes without causing decay in discharge capacity, and meanwhile increases the alloys’ large current discharge capability."
11,Structure stability and surface oxidation/corrosion with cycling,"4.3 Structure stability and surface oxidation/corrosion with cycling Since two major factors lead to the capacity decay of MH electrodes which are (1) structure failure resulted from repeated H absorption (lattice expansion) and desorption (lattice contraction) and (2) loss of active materials resulted from oxidation/corrosion, we next study the x = 0 (La0.75Mg0.25Ni3.5) and x = 0.15 (La0.6Gd0.15Mg0.25Ni3.5) alloys from these two aspects to fundamentally explain the optimization effect of the strategy. 4.3.1 Structure stability Fig. 5 (a)–(b) shows the XRD patterns of the x = 0 and x = 0.15 alloys at different charge/discharge stages (COD/DOD) within one cycle. The H-solid solution and the hydride phases have the same structure. In one XRD pattern, the difference between them is the lattice parameters. Both the solid solution phase and the hydride phase have a range of solubility for hydrogen atoms. Therefore, for both alloys, the diffraction peaks shift towards lower angle during charge and higher angle during discharge, indicating the expansion (H absorption) and contraction (H desorption) of the alloy lattices. In addition, the peaks are broadened to different degrees in this process, indicating the production of microstrain and defects in the alloys. The XRD data were refined using Rietveld method (Figs. S3–S4 and Tables S7–S8), and the phase abundances in Fig. 5(c) show that the H-solid solution phase transforms to hydride phase during charging, causing the increase of the hydride phase abundance and decrease of the H-solid solution phase abundance. During discharging, the reverse reaction takes place and the hydride phase transforms to the H-solid solution phase. Fig. 5(d) shows the mismatch between [A2B4] and [AB5] sublattices in H-solid solution and hydride phases which is represented by their volume difference (ΔV [A2B4]–[AB5]). It is seen that the mismatch mainly exists in the H-solid solution phase instead of the hydride phase for both alloys, which is in agreement with our previous study [18]. In comparison, the mismatch of the x = 0.15 alloy is much lower than that of the x = 0 alloy throughout the charge/discharge process. The maximum ΔV [A2B4]–[AB5] value of the x = 0 H-solid solution phase reaches 10 Å3 in contrast with that of the x = 0.15 which is below 5 Å3. Moreover, the ΔV [A2B4]–[AB5] values of the x = 0 hydride phase are between 1 and 3 Å3 while those of the x = 0.15 are below 1 Å3. The smaller volume mismatch of the x = 0.15 alloy is due to the fact that the initial volumes of the [A2B4] and [AB5] sublattices are equal (8th column of Table 1) so that they absorb and desorb H more synchronically. In comparison, for the x = 0 alloy whose [A2B4] sublattices are larger than the [AB5] sublattices (8th column of Table 1), the [A2B4] sublattices absorb/desorb H at lower hydrogen pressure (lower voltage) than the [AB5] sublattices. This means that the [A2B4] sublattices expand earlier than the [AB5] sublattices during charge and contract latter during discharge, leading to the larger sublattice volume of [A2B4] throughout the charge/discharge process. Note that although the initial [A2B4] and [AB5] sublattices of the x = 0.15 alloy have almost the same size, the sublattice volume of [A2B4] is still larger than [AB5] in the charge/discharge process. This is associated with the higher ratio of A-site elements with stronger H affinity in the [A2B4] sublattices than that in the [AB5] sublattices, which promotes H absorption and retards H desorption of the [A2B4] sublattices, resulting in their earlier expansion and latter contraction compared with the [AB5] sublattices. However, due to the repulsion between H atoms and the characteristics of chemical sites, the affinity effect can be maximized only when most of the sites are not covered by H, which is why the mismatch is the greatest when only 25% of H (COD = 25%, DOD = 75%) is present in the H-solid solution phase of the x = 0.15 alloy. However, for the x = 0 alloy, the mismatch monotonously increases with charging and decreases with discharging because the impact of the initial size difference between [A2B4] and [AB5] sublattices is overwhelming compared with the high H affinity effect of the [A2B4] sublattices. The sublattice mismatch between [A2B4] and [AB5] is an important cause for the mircrostrain in the alloys [18]. But note that the major mismatch exists in the H-solid solution phase, not the hydride phase. Therefore, the phase abundance of the H-solid solution phase also greatly influences the internal microstrain of the alloys. For example, during charge process, the sublattice mismatch between [A2B4] and [AB5] in the H-solid solution phase of the x = 0 alloy increases, but the phase abundance of the H-solid solution decreases. As a result, the microstraion first increases and then decreases as shown in Fig. 5(f). During discharge, the sublattice mismatch between [A2B4] and [AB5] in the H-solid solution phase decreases, but the abundance of the H-solid solution phase increases, which also causes the microstraion to first increase and then decrease. In comparison, the microstrain of the x = 0.15 alloy is much smaller than that of the x = 0 alloy (Fig. 5(f)), in line with its lower sublattice mismatch between [A2B4] and [AB5]. In addition, it has been reported that the smaller the cell volumes are, the greater the microstrain of the alloy is during H absorption/desorption [2,30]. As shown in Table 1, the cell volume of the x = 0.15 alloy is smaller than that of the x = 0 alloy, but it has smaller microstrain during charge/discharge, which further highlights the positive effects of equalizing the sublattice volumes of [A2B4] and [AB5]. Microstrain directly leads to particle break and crystal damage of the alloys during battery cycling [30]. Fig. 6 (a) shows the particle size distribution curves of the x = 0 and x = 0.15 alloys before cycling and after 20 cycles. It is seen that before cycling, the two alloys have similar mean particle size of ca. 50 μm. However, after 20 cycles, the particle size of both alloys becomes much smaller. But no evident peak widening is observed from the curves, meaning that the pulverization degree of different particles of the same alloy is similar, which is attributed to the single-phase structure characteristics of both alloys. In comparison, the cycled x = 0.15 alloy particles are larger than the cycled x = 0 alloy particles. SEM images in Fig. 6(b)–(c) show that most of the x = 0 alloy particles are smaller than those of the x = 0.15 alloy particles, and many very small particles are produced for the x = 0 alloy after cycling, which is in good agreement with the particle size distribution curves in Fig. 6(a). The changes in the crystal structure of the alloys caused by cycling are studied from the XRD patterns after 100 cycles as shown in Fig. 7 (a). The peak intensities of both alloys are damped and the peaks are broadened after cycling, which indicates the increase in defects and the evolution of amorphization [30,31]. But the change of the x = 0.15 alloy is much less compared with that of the x = 0 alloy, suggesting that the x = 0.15 alloy has a more stable crystal structure during hydrogen absorption/desorption cycling. This is further confirmed by the high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images in Fig. 7(b)–(c) which show that the array of atoms of the cycled x = 0 alloy is more blurring than that of the cycled x = 0.15 alloy. The SAED pattern of the x = 0 alloy in the inset of Fig. 7(b) also has more halo while that of the x = 0.15 alloy basically exhibits spotty pattern, indicating the higher crystallization of the x = 0.15 alloy after 100 cycles. 4.3.2 Oxidation/corrosion resistance The oxidation/corrosion resistance of the x = 0 and x = 0.15 alloys is characterized by the Tafel polarization curves as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a). It is seen that the corrosion potential of the x = 0.15 alloy is higher than that of the x = 0 alloy, indicating the better corrosion resistance of the x = 0.15 alloy. This result is consistent with the more positive electronegativity of Gd element than that of La (Fig. 1(d)). Moreover, the SEM images of the x = 0 and x = 0.15 alloy particles after 50th and 100th cycles are shown in Fig. 8 (a)–(d). It is seen that both alloy surfaces are covered by precipitates in comparison with the clean surfaces before cycling (Fig. S5). Fig. 8(a) shows that the precipitates on the x = 0 alloy surface are mostly rod-shape (about 20 ~ 30 nm in diameter and 200 ~ 300 nm in length) which turn to lamella-shape (about 40 nm in thickness and 300 nm in length) after 100 cycles (Fig. 8(b)). The yellow boxes in Fig. 8(a) show some places without precipitates, but the precipitates become very dense after 100 cycles (Fig. 8(b)), indicating the progressive oxidation/corrosion of the active materials of the x = 0 alloy. Noticeably, the places without participates in Fig. 8(a) are very similar to the entire region of the x = 0.15 alloy after 50 and 100 cycles in Fig. 8(c) and (d). Actually, there are very little morphology change from Fig. 8(c) to (d). There are only a few rods and lamellas spreading on the alloy surface with many areas uncovered, indicating that the oxidation/corrosion of the x = 0.15 alloy is light and slow, which is in accordance with its slower capacity degradation compared with that of the x = 0 alloy. Correspondingly, the oxygen contents measured from EDS are 12.39 wt% and 7.58 wt% for the alloy surfaces of Fig. 8(b) and (d), respectively. The above results indicate that the incorporation of Gd retards the growth of the oxidation/corrosion products due to the enhanced oxidation/corrosion resistance, validating the alloy design idea to increase the alloys’ corrosion resistance by adding elements with higher electronegativity. To study the oxidation/corrosion products, the low-angle XRD patterns of the x = 0 and x = 0.15 alloys after 100 cycles are presented in Fig. 9 (a). For a better phase identification, longer acquisition time (20 s per step) was performed for both samples. In addition to the alloy peaks, another two extra peaks at around 15.5° and 19.2° are identified. The former is indexed as R(OH)3 (R = La/Gd) peak while the latter is indexed as Mg(OH)2 or Ni(OH)2 peak or the combination of them. To further identify the product type, the Raman spectra are presented in Fig. 9(b). It is seen that the Ni(OH)2, La(OH)3 and Mg(OH)2 peaks all evidently appear in the spectrum of the cycled x = 0 alloy. While for the x = 0.15 alloy, the Ni(OH)2 peak is very weak. This is in accordance with the comparison of the XRD peaks in Fig. 9(a) which shows the weaker Ni(OH)2/Mg(OH)2 peak of the x = 0.15 alloy than that of the x = 0 alloy. It is known that the oxidation/corrosion of Ni is after that of rare-earth/Mg elements during battery cycling [10,20], thus the lower content of Ni oxidation/corrosion products of the x = 0.15 alloy indicates that the addition of Gd element slows down the oxidation/corrosion progress of the alloy. To study the morphologies of different oxidation/corrosion products, Fig. 9(c1) presents the TEM image of the x = 0.15 alloy surface after 100 cycles, showing two types of oxidation/corrosion products which are rod-shape and lamina-shape, in line with the SEM images in Fig. 8. The rod-shape products are rich in La and Gd elements seen from the EDS mappings in Fig. 9(c2) and (c3), while the laminar products are associated with Mg and Ni elements seen from Fig. 9(c4) and (c5). Oxygen covers all over the region seen from Fig. 9(c6). The results suggest that La/Gd and Mg/Ni elements are segregated during the formation of the oxidation/corrosion products. Noticeably, although Ni makes a large part of the alloy, the signal of Ni (Fig. 9(c5)) is still weaker than that of Mg (Fig. 9(c4)), suggesting its low amount in the oxidation/corrosion products which is in agreement with the results of Raman spectra."
12,Conclusions,"In this work, a new strategy to improve the cycle life of superlattice hydrogen storage alloys is proposed based on the alloys’ structure characteristics analysis and the First-principles calculation. The strategy equalizes the sublattice volumes of [A2B4] and [AB5] of the alloys by the selective occupation of A-site elements between these two kinds of sublattices, and meanwhile enhances the alloys’ oxidation/corrosion resistance by increasing the alloys’ electronegativity. Following this strategy, a series of La0.75- x Gd x Mg0.25Ni3.5 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) alloys with the A2B7-type single-phase structure are designed and prepared, and detailed comparisons are made. The following conclusions are achieved based on the experimental results which validate the alloy optimization strategy: The sublattice volumes of [A2B4] and [AB5] of the La0.6Gd0.15Mg0.25Ni3.5 alloy are almost equal, and this alloy also has stronger oxidation/corrosion resistance than that of the La0.75Mg0.25Ni3.5 pristine alloy. During H absorption/desorption, the highest sublattice volume mismatch between [A2B4] and [AB5] of the La0.6Gd0.15Mg0.25Ni3.5 alloy is only half that of the La0.75Mg0.25Ni3.5 alloy. Correspondingly, La0.6Gd0.15Mg0.25Ni3.5 alloy has less microstrain and preserves better crystal structure after 100 cycles. The oxidation/corrosion of the La0.6Gd0.15Mg0.25Ni3.5 alloy is slower compared with that of the La0.75Mg0.25Ni3.5 alloy. After 100 cycles, the surface oxygen content of the La0.6Gd0.15Mg0.25Ni3.5 alloy is only 7.58 wt% compared with 12.39 wt% of the La0.75Mg0.25Ni3.5 alloy. The cycling stability of the alloys is increased from 82.1% (La0.75Mg0.25Ni3.5) to 88.2% (La0.60Gd0.15Mg0.25Ni3.5) without sacrificing the maximum discharge capacity, and meanwhile the high rate dischargeability is also increased."
