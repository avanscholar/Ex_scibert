0,Introduction,"As biodiesel production has been gaining increased attention, it leads to an oversupply of glycerol as a by-product in the process. With the increasing amount of glycerol, the utilization of glycerol has been a topic of interest by a number of researchers [1–4]. The utilization of glycerol can be divided into 2 categories: (i) purifying glycerol for applications such as pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries and (ii) converting glycerol to higher value chemicals including propylene glycol, glyceric acid, acrolein, and/or renewable fuel, particularly H2 production [1,5]. H2 production can be achieved through various reforming processes such as steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation, aqueous phase reforming, autothermal reforming, and supercritical water reforming (SWR) [6]. Supercritical water reforming offers the advantages of improved space-time yield, reduced mass transfer limitations and being more favourable towards endothermic reforming reactions, as compared to steam and liquid water reforming [7]. Moreover, high pressure H2 production lowers external energy requirement for hydrogen compression. Cobalt is a non-noble metal which is widely used with a variety of metal oxide supports in ethanol SR [8–12]. Cobalt catalyst was found to provide similar activity to noble metal catalysts in the C-C bond cleavage, even at low operating temperatures [9,10,13]. Llorca et al. [9] conducted ethanol SR process at 673 K by varying different transition metal catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3. It was found that the reaction selectivity increased in the order: Co >> Ni > Rh > Pt, Ru, Cu. Zhang et al. [14] reported that Co loaded on CeO2 was active in glycerol SR processes, which completely converted glycerol and promoted 88% hydrogen selectivity with low values of CO and CH4. Banach et al. [15] found that 24 wt.% of cobalt on alumina-stabilized zinc oxide support in ethanol SR process at 693 K was an optimum condition for hydrogen production, where a complete conversion of ethanol with small amounts of CO (approximately 2–3%) was observed. However, increasing partial pressure of glycerol in the feed stream caused carbon formation on the catalyst [16]. Based on these researches, Co metal is employed in this study. La2O3, α-Al2O3, γ-Al2O3, ZrO2 and Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were selected as the supports for glycerol reforming assessment. Consequently, additional details on glycerol reforming of these supports are provided below. La2O3has been proposed to provide the advantage in the reforming process by a number of studies [17–19]. Fatsikostas et al. [20] investigated SR of ethanol process by using nickel loaded on different supports including La2O3, γ-Al2O3, YSZ, and MgO. Ni/La2O3 catalyst showed excellent performance with high activity towards hydrogen rich gas, and long-term stability. The improved stability may originate from the scavenging of carbon formation on the Ni surface by intermediate formation of La2O2CO3 (La2O3 + CO2). This agrees with previous studies [17,21] which described that La2O3 support acted as a dynamic oxygen pool in the reforming process over Ni/La2O3 catalyst. Similarly, Sun et al. [18] found that Ni/La2O3 was the best catalyst among Ni/Y2O3, and Ni/Al2O3 in the hydrogen production from SR of ethanol at low temperature (i.e. 523–623 K) for fuel cell application, indicating high catalytic activity, high stability, and high hydrogen selectivity. Moreover, the rapid deactivation from carbon formation was not found when La2O3 was employed in the methane reforming. This can be explained that lanthana participated in cleaning the catalyst surface which reacted with the carbon formed in the methane reforming [19]. α-Al2O3 is the most stable phase of alumina due to its crystalline structure, chemical and physical stabilities [22,23]. It also offers high mechanical resistance [23,24] and low cost [25]. However, the formation of carbon may cause reaction failure, and α-Al2O3 with a low surface area may cause low metallic dispersion and metal–support interaction [25,26]. Buffoni et al. [25] reported that Ni/CeO2/α-Al2O3can inhibit carbon formation in the SR of glycerol, and high selectivity of hydrogen was obtained at 823 K. γ-Al2O3is commonly used in the reforming process due to its high thermal and chemical stabilities [8,11,16,27–29]. γ-Al2O3 is proposed to contain greater acidic sites and have higher surface area than α-Al2O3. Moreover, nickel-loaded γ-Al2O3 demonstrated greater nickel particle dispersion and then a higher hydrogen production as compared to α-Al2O3 [24]. Haga et al. [8] indicated that using γ-Al2O3 as a support for Co loading was more efficient for hydrogen production from ethanol SR than other support as seen in the order: Co/γ-Al2O3 > Co/ZrO2 > Co/MgO > Co/SiO2 > Co/C. Vaidya and Rodrigues [30] and Profeti et al. [11] found that the dehydration of ethanol took an important role to produce undesired products including ethylene from the acidic property when γ-Al2O3 was used in SR of ethanol [11,30]. Ethylene was reported to be a major precursor of carbon formation in polymerization reactions which caused catalyst deactivation [13,30]especially with small metal loading [28]. ZrO2 is widely used as a support, especially for Pt/ZrO2, for CO2 reforming of methane to generate synthesis gas [31–33]. Goud et al. [34] reported that ZrO2 was stable at high operating temperatures due to its thermal stability. In addition, it promotes good properties such as electrical conductivity, oxygen vacancies and strong resistance against carbon formation [35,36]. Song et al. [10] studied the SR of bio-ethanol over three cobalt-based catalysts consisting of γ-Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2. The best activity for hydrogen production was provided by 10 wt.% Co/ZrO2 at 823 K. Nguyen et al. [37] found that 15 wt.% Ni/ZrO2 achieved the highest activity and good stability in SR of methane at 873 K. Yttria-stabilized zirconia or YSZ is the zirconium oxide to which is added yttrium oxide in order to improve its properties such as improved surface area, thermal stability, and electrical conductivity. It is widely used in the solid oxide fuel cell [38–41]. Laosiripojana and Assabumrungrat [39] conducted the SR of methane, methanol, and ethanol with Ni/YSZ which acted as the anode of SOFC. They reported that it is possible to directly feed methane and methanol to Ni/YSZ anode without carbon formation problem. However, ethanol is needed to be pre-reformed using Ni/Ce–ZrO2 before passing to the surface of Ni/YSZ anode catalyst to avoid carbon formation problem. Resini et al. [40] investigated SR of ethanol process by using YSZ supported Ni–Co alloys. Ni–Co(25:25)/YSZ showed a good performance, with complete conversion of ethanol and hydrogen yield of 65% at 670 K. They explained that cobalt inhibited dehydration reaction, methane production and then enhanced the hydrogen yield. Bellido and Assaf [35] found that the hydrogen selectivity in the SR of ethanol was improved when ZrO2 was replaced by YSZ support. However, it gave poor results when ZrO2 was modified to CaO-stabilized ZrO2 support (CSZ), explaining that other interactions were involved with the oxygen vacancies, leading to different catalytic behaviour of nickel species. Although a number of studies have developed catalysts to improve the hydrogen production and suppress undesired by-products in the glycerol reforming process, no direct assessment of cobalt-based catalysts under supercritical water reforming of glycerol were found in the literature. This study focuses on the effect of operating temperatures (723–848 K), catalyst supports (La2O3, α-Al2O3, δ-Al2O3, ZrO2, and YSZ), WHSV (3.15, 6.45 and 10.8 h−1), and percent of metal loading (0, 5, 10, and 15 wt.%) on the H2 production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Glycerol (Fisher scientific, USP/FCC) was mixed with deionized water (DI water) at required weight percent solution as an organic feedstock. Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar, 98.0–102.0%) was used as a precursor for cobalt loading. Commercial supports including YSZ (TOSOH, TZ-8Y, powder), La2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%, powder), ZrO2 (Aldrich, 99%, powder), γ-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.97%, powder), α-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.98%, powder) were employed in this work. Ethylene glycol (Acros Organics, 99.5%) was dissolved in DI water at 30% v/v as a coolant in the cooling unit. Acetaldehyde (Sigma–Aldrich, ≥99.5%), propionaldehyde (Sigma–Aldrich, 97%), acetone (Sigma–Aldrich, 99.9%), acrolein (Sigma–Aldrich, 90%), methanol (Caledon, ≥99.8%), ethanol (Sigma–Aldrich, HPLC grade), isopropanol (Sigma–Aldrich, 99.9%), 1-propanol (Baker analyzed reagent, 99%), allyl alcohol (Aldrich, 99%), acetol (Aldrich, 90%), acetic acid (Sigma–Aldrich, 99.7%), acrylic acid (Aldrich, 99%) and ethylene glycol (Acros Organics, 99.5%) were used to make calibration curves as standards for identifying concentrations in the liquid product solution. 1-4 butanediol (Sigma–Aldrich, 99%) was employed as an internal standard. Mixed gas (Praxair, 30% CO, 30% CO2, 25% CH4, 10% C2H4, and 5% C2H6), hydrogen (Praxair, 99.999%), and nitrogen (Praxair, 99.999%) were mixed and filled in Kynar Gas Sampling bags (Cole–Parmer, 6″ × 6″) at different concentrations for the calibration curves in gas analysis. Screens (Sigma–Aldrich, 40, 60 mesh) were used as filters on the top and bottom of the reactor."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Cobalt (Co) was deposited on the commercial support via wet impregnation method by using Co(NO3)2·6H2O as a precursor. Initially, 250 mL of DI water in a beaker was stirred and heated at 363 K. The commercial support was dispersed in DI water, followed by slight addition of precursor. The beaker was then covered with an aluminium foil for 5 h. After that, the solution was vaporized until it became very thick and paste-like. The paste product was dried overnight in an oven at 383 K and then calcined at 973 K for 5 h under air atmosphere. The product was crushed, and the catalyst with a particle size between 1.4 and 2 mm was collected through a sieve with 2 screens including 1.4 and 2 mm."
4,Method,"2.3 Method Schematic diagram of the supercritical water reforming process is shown in Fig. 1 . Initially, DI water was fed to a preheater (Thar designs, H-1) by high pressure pump (Thar designs, P-1) at 473 K, and further heated to the desired operating temperatures (varying from 723 K to 848 K) inside the furnace (Fisher scientific, F-1). A mixture of glycerol and water, which was delivered by a syringe pump (Teledyne Isco, 260D, P-2), was mixed with the heated DI water at the cross above the Inconel-625 reactor (Autoclave Engineer Inc., R-1, 76.2 mm long, 54.10 mm o.d., and 12.7 mm i.d.). The mixtures flow downward through the reactor passing screens and reacting area containing 1 g of catalyst under a pressure of 25 MPa. Prior to entering the back pressure regulator (Thar designs, BPR-1), the product stream was cooled down to 283 K through a cooler (Polyscience, H-2). The cooled product was delivered to a gas liquid separator (GLS-1) where the gas phase product flowing to the top was collected in a Kynar gas sampling bag and subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Varian CP-3800). Liquid products at the bottom of separator were periodically sampled for liquid analysis by GC (Agilent 6890). ICM software (Thar designs) was used for controlling the system (i.e. high pressure pump and preheater). The mean residence time is described as a function of mass flow rate and the fluid density as described by Eq. (1) [42,43] (1) τ = V R φ ρ 0 m 0 where V R is the volume of reactor, φ is the void fraction of bed (it is equal to 1 for empty reactor), m 0 is the mass flow rate of the fluid into the reactor, ρ 0 is the density of the fluid depending on the pressure and temperature at reactor conditions. The fluid density can be approximated by pure water when glycerol with a low concentration (approximately 5 wt.%) was employed. Glycerol conversion, X Glycerol (Eq. (2)), concentration in gas phase (Eq. (3)), H2 yield (Eq. (4)), and yield of carbon containing species i (Eq. (5)) are defined as follows. (2) X Glycerol = F Glycerol , in − F Glycerol , out F Glycerol , in (3) Concentration in gas phase of species i ( mol% ) = F i , gas ∑ n F i , gas × 100 (4) H 2 yield = F H 2 F Glycerol , in (5) Yield of carbon containing species i = F i F Glycerol , in × number of carbon atom in molecule 3 where F Glycerol,in and F Glycerol,out are the inlet and outlet glycerol molar flow rates, respectively, and F i is the molar flow rate of species i."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of support and operating temperature,"3.1 Effect of support and operating temperature Table 1 shows the surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of cobalt supported catalysts used in this study. The surface area of Co3O4 catalysts is in the following order: γ-Al2O3 >> La2O3 > YSZ > α-Al2O3 > ZrO2. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of bare commercial supports and their respective Co-based catalysts. The profile of the Co-based catalysts displays additional peaks compared to the profile of the bare commercial supports, with new peaks appearing at 2θ = 31.3, 36.8, 45.1, 59.4, and 65.4°, demonstrating the formation of Co3O4 phase in the system, known as the cobalt phase. Llorca et al. [44,45] explained that Co3O4 phase was transformed to CoO and then metallic cobalt (Co0) at high operating temperatures (ca. 673 K) of SR process. Therefore, it might be hypothesized that the reactions could be proceeded without pre-reduction of catalyst prior to the reforming reactions as will be discussed later. The influence of Co-based catalysts on glycerol conversion at operating temperatures in the range of 723–848 K is illustrated in Fig. 3 .The reaction was set under the following conditions: 10 wt.% Co loading, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 6.45 h−1 and time on stream (TOS) of 230 min. Cobalt-based catalysts were observed to enhance glycerol reforming reaction as compared with the results under empty Inconel-625 conditions [46], especially at low operating temperatures (723–773 K). The glycerol conversion is observed to increase with increasing operating temperatures over all Co-loaded on commercial supports, corresponding to the endothermic reaction of glycerol steam reforming (SR) as expressed by Eq. (6): (6) CH 2 OHCHOHCH 2 OH + 3 H 2 O ⇌ 3 CO 2 + 7 H 2 ; Δ H 298 K = + 122.81 kJ / mol Complete glycerol conversion was obtained over Co/La2O3, Co/ZrO2and Co/YSZ at the highest operating temperature of 848 K, in which these three catalysts displayed similar glycerol conversion in the high operating temperature range of 798–848 K. In the cases of Co/γ-Al2O3 and Co/α-Al2O3catalysts, experiments failures occurred at operating temperature over 748 K for Co/γ-Al2O3 and over 798 K for Co/α-Al2O3. This may be attributed to high acidic sites in Al2O3 supports causing carbon formation. The highest operating temperature for γ-Al2O3 is lower than that for α-Al2O3 presumably because of higher surface area and higher catalyst acidity. The liquid product samples from the supercritical water reforming of glycerol at 748 K shows the solid carbon found on the filtrated paper. A possible reason for the experiment failure may be attributed to carbon plugging at the screens (inside reactor), tubes, and back pressure regulator (BPR). Our results supported previous findings [11,13,25,29,30] which reported that the acidic sites of Al2O3 supports have an influence on carbon formation, especially at high operating temperatures. Figs. 4(a–d) and 5(a–d) illustrate the gas yields (i.e., H2, CO2, CH4 and CO) and liquid yields (i.e., acetaldehyde, acetone, methanol and acetic acid) of Co-based catalysts over temperatures ranging between 723 K and 848 K, respectively. This study reveals that the H2 yield in relation to the catalyst support increased in the order: Co/YSZ > Co/La2O3 = Co/ZrO2 > Co/α-Al2O3 > Co/γ-Al2O3. By-products in the gas phase predominantly comprised of CO2 together with a little CH4 and CO. Interestingly, CO generated in the reactor with Co-based supports was present in smaller amounts as compared to CO formation (yield = 0.47) in the empty Inconel reactor at 823 K [46]. This may be attributed to Co catalyst promoting the water gas shift reaction to form CO2 and H2. The shift reaction is initiated through interaction of CO with OH-, which are formed by ionic dissociation of supercritical water on the metal surface, and forming the formate ion which then decomposes into CO2 and hydride anion. The hydride anion further interacts with water, forming H2 and OH by electron transfer [47,48]. The products in the liquid phase, including acetaldehyde (main product), acetone, methanol and acetic acid, were also detected. Additional details on product yields over the different catalysts are provided below. 3.1.1 Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst Co/γ-Al2O3catalyst exhibited H2 yield and gas product yields including CO2 and CH4 lower than others, despite Co/γ-Al2O3catalyst promoting a high glycerol conversion. However, a high CO yield was observed compared to other gas products. From the liquid analysis, it was found that acetaldehyde is by far the major liquid product, and the rest were methanol and acrolein. This can be explained by glycerol decomposition to acetaldehyde and formaldehyde as described by Eq. (7) [49,50], from which a high conversion of glycerol can be observed, as reported earlier. The formaldehyde was subsequently decomposed to H2, CO, and CO2 via Eqs. (8) and (9) [43,51,52]. In addition, methanol and acrolein occurred via acetaldehyde steam reforming (Eq. (10)) [53,54] and dehydration of glycerol (Eq. (11)), respectively [49,50,55]. Methanol was partially reformed to H2, CO, and CO2 as described by Eq. (12) [53,54]. The formation of carbon causing reaction failure is likely attributed to either Boudouard reaction (Eq. (13)), methane cracking (Eq. (14)) or ethylene cracking (Eq. (15)) [29,53,54], especially at temperatures above 748 K. 3.1.2 Co/α-Al2O3 catalyst Co/α-Al2O3catalyst was found to yield low gas products due to its lower glycerol conversion. Interestingly, high yields of acetaldehyde in the liquid product and carbon formation were found which was similarly observed for Co/γ-Al2O3catalyst. The aforementioned results ascertained the presence of acidic site in Al2O3 (i.e., γ-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3) have an impact on governing acetaldehyde and carbon formation. The high yield of methane and carbon monoxide was caused by decomposition of acetaldehyde in Eq. (16) [53,54,56]. Higher CH4 yield (except Co/YSZ) was the reason to have lower H2 yield in the product stream. Decomposition of glycerol: (7) CH 2 OHCHOHCH 2 OH ⇌ CH 3 CHO + HCHO + H 2 O ; Δ H 298 K = + 61.29 kJ / mol − 1 Decomposition of formaldehyde: (8) HCHO ⇌ H 2 + CO ; Δ H 298 K = − 1.93 kJ / mol − 1 Water gas shift (WGS or reverse of this is called RWGS): (9) CO + H 2 O ⇌ CO 2 + H 2 ; Δ H 298 K = − 41.17 kJ / mol Acetaldehyde steam reforming: (10) CH 3 CHO + H 2 O ⇌ CH 3 OH + CO + H 2 ; Δ H 298 K = + 96.54 kJ / mol − 1 Dehydration of glycerol: (11) CH 2 OHCHOHCH 2 OH ⇌ CH 2 CHCHO + 2 H 2 O ; Δ H 298 K = + 12.47 kJ / mol − 1 Methanol steam reforming: (12) CH 3 OH + H 2 O ⇌ 3 H 2 + CO 2 ; Δ H 298 K = + 49.24 kJ / mol − 1 Boudouard reaction: (13) 2 CO ⇌ CO 2 + C ( s ) ; Δ H 298 K = − 172.45 kJ / mol Methane cracking: (14) CH 4 ⇌ 2 H 2 + C ( s ) ; Δ H 298 K = + 74.52 kJ / mol C2H4 cracking: (15) C 2 H 4 ⇌ 2 H 2 + 2 C ( s ) ; Δ H 298 K = − 52.51 kJ / mol − 1 Decomposition of acetaldehyde: (16) CH 3 CHO ⇌ CO + CH 4 ; Δ H 298 K = − 18.85 kJ / mol − 1 3.1.3 Co/La2O3, and Co/ZrO2 catalysts With the product yield profiles, Co/La2O3, and Co/ZrO2 were found to present similar trend when varying operating temperatures. The H2 yield continually increased when increasing operating temperatures. The highest H2 yields of Co/La2O3, and Co/ZrO2 were 2.24 and 2.43, respectively. Acetaldehyde yield, which is a main liquid product, was observed to increase with the operating temperatures. Above 773 K, acetaldehyde yield decreased due to further reactions of acetaldehyde to produce CO2 and H2 as described in Eqs. (9), (10) and (16). Liquid products also included methanol, acetic acid, acetone, acetol, and ethylene glycol. Acetic acid and methanol occurred via the decomposition of glycerol (Eq. (17)) [57]. Acetic acid was then converted to acetone via decarboxylation at high operating temperatures (Eq. (18)), which was similarly reported by Watanabe et al. [58]. They explained that ZrO2 supports with acid sites equal to basic sites catalyzed the acetone formation in supercritical water condition. Acetol was a product obtained from dehydration of glycerol, as illustrated in Eq. (19). Acetol yield decreased with an increase in operating temperature (results not shown here). This is in good agreement with previous studies [55,59]. In addition, ethylene glycol could be obtained through fragmentation reaction of glycerol (Eq. (20)) [52]. However, most of these intermediate liquid products tend to decrease with increasing temperature up to 848 K as they were decomposed to H2 and CO2. Decomposition of glycerol: (17) CH 2 OHCHOHCH 2 OH ⇌ CH 3 COOH + CH 3 OH ; Δ H 298 K = − 55.84 kJ / mol − 1 Decarboxylation of acetic acid: (18) 2 CH 3 COOH ⇌ CH 3 COCH 3 + CO 2 + H 2 O ; Δ H 298 K = + 14.58 kJ / mol − 1 Dehydration of glycerol: (19) CH 2 OHCHOHCH 2 OH ⇌ CH 3 COCH 2 OH + H 2 O ; Δ H 298 K = − 36.96 kJ / mol − 1 Fragmentation reaction of glycerol (20) CH 2 OHCHOHCH 2 OH ⇌ CH 2 OHCH 2 OH + HCHO ; Δ H 298 K = + 81.80 kJ / mol − 1 3.1.4 Co/YSZ catalyst The best performance was provided by Co/YSZ catalyst, generating much more H2 than others over the entire range of operating temperatures. The H2 yield was found not to follow a monotonous trend with temperature, but presented a maximum of 3.8 at 773 K, after which it decreased with increasing temperature (Fig. 4(a)). The influence of operating temperatures on the yields of CO2 and CH4 was similar to that observed for H2 yield, gradually increasing up to 773 K and then decreasing at higher temperatures. The changes in gas products including H2, CO2 and CH4 were found to be related to the corresponding opposite trends for CO and liquid products, which presented minimum yields at 773 K. Fig. 6 shows the H2 and acetaldehyde yields over a 10wt% Co/YSZ catalyst at different temperatures and as a function of time on stream. As shown in Fig. 6(a), H2 could be effectively produced within the first 30 min and this might prove that the pre-reduction of catalyst prior to the reforming reaction is unnecessary under the temperature over 723 K. The results agree with literature which indicated that pre-reduction is unnecessary prior to the reaction [12,29] as Co3O4 could be reduced to CoO and Co metal during reforming reaction. Within the first 30 min an increase in temperatures from 723 K to 748 K slightly enhanced H2 yield from 0.43 to 0.87. A further increase in temperature promoted a significant increase in H2 yield, with highest yield of 4.23 observed at 798 K. Above 798 K the H2 yield decreased. Lower H2 yields at high temperature (i.e. above 798 K) imply that catalyst deactivation may start very rapidly, within 30 min before the first data are collected. Fig. 6 shows that at the low temperature of 723 K there was no discernible difference in H2 yield over time on stream between 30 and 230 min. At the highest temperature of 848 K, the H2 yield remained quite constant at around 3 over time on stream. For intermediate temperatures, in particular where the H2 yield is the highest (e.g. at 798 K), catalyst deactivation over time is more pronounced. The trend of H2 yield with temperature and over time can be correlated to that of acetaldehyde yield: high H2 yield is always accompanied with low acetaldehyde yield. These findings illustrate low amount of acetaldehyde caused enhanced H2 yield when Co/YSZ catalyst was employed which might imply by mean that acetaldehyde further reacted to ultimately form more H2, e.g. through acetaldehyde reforming, Eq. (10). The distribution of the gas phase species when using Co/YSZ catalyst at different temperatures with TOS of 230 min is shown in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7(a) revealed that the gas phase mainly consisted of approximately 60% H2 and 30% CO2. CH4 and CO vary in opposite trend when changing temperatures. The continuous decrease of CO at temperatures between 723 K and 773 K can be explained by CO (originating from acetaldehyde decomposition, Eq. (16)) being further reacting to selectively produce higher H2 concentration (Eq. (9)). This type of water gas shift is called “fast type water gas shift reaction”. This was similar to the supercritical water gasification of glucose above 848 and 823 K reported by Holgate et al. [60]and Lee et al. [61], respectively. Increasing the operating temperature beyond 773 K promoted an increase in CO concentration as explained by methanation: Eqs. (21) and (22), RWGS, Eq. (9). Interestingly, CO showed opposite trend to that of CH4 at all operating temperatures which may be attributed to methanation reaction (Eq. (21)). Fig. 7(b) shows that with increasing operating temperature C2H6 concentration increased while only slight changes for C2H4, C3H8 and C3H6 concentration were observed. The continuous increase of C2H6implies that C2H6 is the most stable compound among theC2–3 gas product compounds and the most difficult to decompose. Bennekom et al. [42] stated that it was not clear whether C2H6 was a primary gas product in supercritical water reforming of glycerol – it probably originated from hydrogenation of C2H4 or combination. Methanation (MET): (21) CO + 3 H 2 ⇌ CH 4 + H 2 O ; Δ H 298 K = − 205.80 kJ / mol (22) CO 2 + 4 H 2 ⇌ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O ; Δ H 298 K = − 164.64 kJ / mol Among different Co-based catalysts, Co/YSZ offers the highest H2 yield. For the conditions encountered here, a suitable operating temperature is 773 K which gives high H2 yield accompanied with stability, at least over 230 min time on stream."
7,Effect of Co loading (Co/YSZ catalysts),"3.2 Effect of Co loading (Co/YSZ catalysts) In this section, the reaction was carried out under the following conditions: operating temperature of 773 K, WHSV of 6.45 h−1 and time on stream of 230 min. Table 2 shows the physical properties of Co-based YSZ support for loadings between 0 and 15 wt.% Co. The surface area of YSZ decreased as the Co content was increased from 5 wt.% (11.42 m2/g) to 10 wt.% (9.64 m2/g). With a further increase to 15 wt.% Co, a decreased surface area and pore volume were not observed. The unchanged surface area may be attributed to a full deposition of cobalt on YSZ. The presence of cobalt on YSZ support is corroborated by XRD profile in Fig. 8 . Co/YSZ profiles displays additional peaks compared to YSZ profiles. The peaks corresponding to cobalt become distinct with increasing in cobalt loading up to 10 wt.% Co/YSZ. The intensity of those peaks then remained constant for 15 wt.% Co/YSZ. The influence of Co content on glycerol conversion and gas yields is depicted in Table 3 . The change in cobalt loading did not significantly affect the glycerol conversion, ranging between 0.88 and 0.94. With an increase in cobalt content up to 10 wt.%, H2, CO2, and CH4 yields increased, whereas CO yield decreased. However, insignificant effect was observed when increasing cobalt loading to 15 wt.%. Liquid analysis, shown in Table 4 , depicted that an increased cobalt content led to a significant decrease in liquid product yields. Since for both gaseous and liquid product, there was very little difference between 10 wt.% and 15 wt.% Co loading, it is proposed that 10 wt.% Co/YSZ be the optimum loading. Fig. 9(a) and (b) exhibit the gas product distribution, depending on cobalt loading. The presence of cobalt was found to inhibit CO formation by promoting WGS reaction (Eq. (9)). On the other hand, increase in CH4 concentration was explained by the decomposition of acetaldehyde in Eq. (16). For C2–3 gas product compounds, the most stable compound of C2H6 was observed to increase when increasing cobalt loading above 5 wt.%."
8,Effect of WHSV,"3.3 Effect of WHSV WHSV is defined as (23) WHSV = m Glycerol , 0 M catalyst where m Glycerol , 0 is the mass flow rate of glycerol into the reactor (g h−1) and M catalyst is the mass of catalyst (g). Table 5 demonstrates the influence of WHSV on glycerol conversion and gas product yields. With operating temperature 798 K, WHSV of 3.15, 6.45 and 10.8 h−1correspond to low (1.05 g min−1), medium (2.15 g min−1) and high feed rates (3.60 g min−1), respectively as the calculated from Eq. (23). A decrease in WHSV from 10.8 to 3.15 h−1promoted glycerol conversion and subsequent increase in gas yields, as a consequence of an increased mean residence time. Such effect of WHSV has been described to facilitate longer reaction times to produce a greater quantity of H2. The change in H2 and acetaldehyde yields as a function of time on stream and WHSV is depicted in Fig. 10 . Fig. 10(a) shows that at higher WHSV (e.g. 10.8 h−1), H2 yield becomes less stable due to the stability issues of the system i.e. uncontrollable pressure at BPR. A low WHSV of 3.15 h−1, which led to stable pressure during the course of the reaction, provided the highest H2 yield up to 3.5 (Fig. 10(a)) and lowest acetaldehyde yield (Fig. 10(b)) over 230 min. Compared to the operating condition at a temperature of 773 K (Fig. 6) with WHSV of 6.45 h−1, the change in H2 of reaction operated at 773 K with WHSV of 6.45 h−1 shows a greater quantity of H2 yield up to 3.72 and lower acetaldehyde yield over 230 min. These observations suggest that a WHSV of 6.45 h−1 and a temperature of 773 K would be an appropriate condition for SCWR of glycerol catalyzed by Co/YSZ."
9,Conclusion,"Cobalt-based catalysts on La2O3, ZrO2, α-Al2O3, γ-Al2O3 and YSZ supports were found to decrease CO formation and improve the performance of supercritical water glycerol reforming. The conversion of glycerol continually increased with increasing temperatures, where temperature of 848 K resulted in a complete conversion of glycerol for all Co-based catalysts, except Co/α-Al2O3 and Co/γ-Al2O3. The limited operating temperatures for α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3 were caused by carbon formation, plugging the system. Co/YSZ provided a comparatively higher H2 yield over the temperature range of 723–848 K. Operating at 773 K with a WHSV of 6.45 h−1 (corresponding to a feed rate of 1.05 g min−1) led to stable and highest H2 yield, at least for 230 min time on stream. Moreover, an increase in Co loading on YSZ promoted the glycerol conversion and H2 yield. Optimum performance (stability and H2 yield) was found at 10 wt.% Co loading."
