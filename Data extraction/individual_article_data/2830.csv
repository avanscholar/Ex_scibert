0,Introduction,"Alternative and renewable energy technologies are being sought throughout the world to reduce pollutant emissions and increase the efficiency of energy use. Oil is the main source of fuels for global transportation. The advent of fuel cells for automotive applications can relax the dependency on foreign oil. A means of removing the dependency on foreign oil would be to use fuels derived from renewable sources, e.g., Fischer–Tropsch fuels or fuels such as bio-gas, biomass and coal. For this reason, applications of ethanol, biodiesel and biogasoline are now being actively researched [1–3]. Polymer-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells are a good alternative for automotive application due to their high power density and low-temperature operation [4]. In order to commercialise this technology, economical sources and processes for the production of high-quality hydrogen need to be explored. Production of hydrogen from various renewable sources such as bioethanol, methanol, biodiesel, dimethyl ether and bio-oil is being widely researched [5–9]. Hydrogen production from by-product glycerol obtained from biodiesel has also been examined as an affordable source [10–12]. Recently n-butanol has been proposed as an alternative to conventional gasoline and diesel fuels [13–16]. Butanol can be used directly as a fuel or by blending with gasoline and diesel. Butanol is produced by fermentation process and its feedstocks can include sugar beet, sugar cane, corn, wheat and potentially lignocellulosic biomass [17]. Recently, BP and DuPont announced that they would market n-butanol, called biobutanol, as a gasoline blending component in the UK [18]. The advantages of using butanol can be briefly summarised as follows: (1) Lower vapour pressure compared to ethanol and gasoline, which reduces the chance of vapour lock; (2) Higher energy content, 110,000Btu per gallon for butanol vs 84,000Btu per gallon for ethanol (gasoline contains about 115,000Btu per gallon); (3) Greater tolerance to water contamination; (4) Butanol can be blended at higher concentrations without retrofitting vehicles; (5) Butanol can be used in existing fuel distribution pipelines compared to ethanol; (6) The hydrogen content of butanol (13.51wt %) is higher compared to ethanol (13.04wt %) and methanol (12.5wt %). (7) Butanol is an oxygenated hydrocarbon like methanol, ethanol etc. Oxygenated fuels have been shown to improve reforming activity and reduce the rate of carbon deposition through a favourable route to CO/CO2 in solid-oxide fuel cells [19]. Due to these advantages of butanol for blending with gasoline, and its higher hydrogen content, butanol can be exploited for generating hydrogen for fuel cell applications. Hydrogen can be produced by partial oxidation (PO), autothermal reforming (ATR) and steam reforming (SR). The PO and ATR processes have the merits of fast start-up times because of the exothermic nature of the oxidation reaction. However, the SR provides higher efficiency and reformates quality, i.e., a higher hydrogen yield, lower rate of side reactions and fewer by-products. This reaction is strongly endothermic, requiring a flame to heat the reactor to the reforming temperature necessary to achieve high conversion. Due to higher hydrogen yield obtained in the steam reforming process, it was selected to investigate hydrogen production from butanol. Steam reforming of butanol and acetol as model components of bio-oil was examined using a nickel (Ni-Al) based co-precipitated catalyst at 750°C. The performance of the process was measured in terms of grams of gases and liquids produced per grams of butanol or acetol. The carbon conversion to product gases defined as moles of carbon in the product gases/mole of carbon in the feed was calculated. Carbon from butanol and acetol was converted to gases up to 50% and 86% respectively. [20]. The ratio of catalyst to feed flow rate (W/m org) significantly influenced steam reforming of both acetol and butanol. When W/m org is increased, carbon conversion to gases is increased along with H2 and CO2 yields, while CH4 and C2H6 are diminished. The analysis of the steam reforming of 2-butanol, a component of industrial wastes from the semiconductor industry has been reported in the literature [21]. While extremely reactive with a freshly activated catalyst, 2-butanol showed the lowest conversion of all solvents after a few hours. The greater stability of the carbonylic functional groups as compared to hydroxylic entities and the direct relationship between poisoning due to coke formation and the carbon atom number of the substrate explains the rapid deactivation with 2-butanol. Lack of literature pertaining to hydrogen production by the SRB has prompted a detailed thermodynamic evaluation of the process, carried out in this study. The objective of this work was to use steam reforming to maximise the production of high-quality hydrogen from butanol. Thermodynamic equilibrium of the SRB into a hydrogen-rich feed for fuel cells was analysed by a Gibbs free-energy-minimisation method. Several thermodynamic evaluations of hydrogen production by steam reforming of various oxygenated hydrocarbons like methanol, ethanol, glycerol and dimethyl ether have been examined in the literature using a Gibbs free-energy-minimisation method [22–25]. Complete conversion of methanol with 70% dry selectivity for hydrogen was obtained at steam-to-carbon ratio (SCR) of 1:1 in the temperature range of 200–500°C at 1bar [26]. A hydrogen yield of between 60.52 and 83.58% with 32.82–79.60% that for carbon monoxide was obtained in the steam reforming of ethanol at 630–730°C and water-to-ethanol ratio of 3.6 [23]. Similarly, it has been suggested that the best conditions for producing hydrogen from glycerol by steam reforming are 650°C and a molar ratio of water to glycerol of 9:1 [27,28]. Under these conditions, methane production is minimised and carbon formation is thermodynamically inhibited. For the production of synthesis gas, the optimum conditions are temperatures above 762°C and water/glycerol ratios between 2 and 3 at 20–50bar pressure [29]. All the thermodynamic evaluations of heavier alcohols like ethanol have shown high yield and selectivity for hydrogen above 600°C and higher reactant ratio at a pressure of 1bar. Therefore temperatures above 600°C and high WBFR at 1bar seem to be a good initial starting point for evaluation of the SRB. Higher pressure thermodynamically restrains coke formation but affects hydrogen formation adversely [23]. In the present study it is shown that the formation of coke is reduced due to methanation reactions at higher pressures and lower temperatures. Thus the effects of several parameters like temperature, pressure and WBFR on hydrogen production by the SRB were examined in detail. The influence of these parameters on coke formation in the process was also analysed. This work provides the thermodynamical data necessary for guiding in-situ studies of the SRB."
1,Modelling methodology,
2,Minimisation of Gibbs free energy,"2.1 Minimisation of Gibbs free energy Equilibrium compositions can be calculated in two ways, either by calculating the equilibrium constants or by minimising the Gibbs free energy. The former approach requires the knowledge of the chemical reactions involved and makes it difficult to estimate carbon formation during the reforming process [30]. The advantage of the latter is that it can be easily applied for reacting systems including condensed species [31]. However, the method can be used for non-reacting species as well as for reacting species. During the steam reforming of any organic fuel, including butanol, solid carbon (or coke) can be expected to be formed due to various phenomena explained later. The method of minimising the Gibbs free energy is thus more suitable for the present work. The software CHEMCAD was used for carrying out the simulations. The total Gibbs free energy G T of the system is given by: (1) G T = ∑ i = 1 m n i G i = ∑ i = 1 m n i G i 0 + R T ∑ n i ln f i f i 0 also: (2) G T = ∑ i = 1 m n i μ i For reacting species in gas phase: (3) μ i = h i − T s i or: (4) μ i = h i − T [ s i 0 − R ln ( p p 0 ) ] or: (5) μ i = μ i 0 + R T ln ( n i n ) + R T ln ( p p 0 ) Assuming that the gas behaves as an ideal gas, we can replace fugacities of Eq. (1) by partial pressures, which will yield the result as shown in Eq. (5). Introducing Lagrange multipliers for species i, (6) G i + ∑ j = 0 k λ j a j i = 0 where λj is the Lagrange multiplier, aj is the number of atoms of species i in element j. Therefore combining Eqs. (1), (5), and (6), for ideal gases yields: (7) μ i 0 R T + ln ( n i n ) + ln ( p p 0 ) + ∑ j = 0 k λ j a j i = 0 For the condensed species: (8) μ i 0 R T + ∑ j = 0 k λ j a j i = 0 For a given reacting system, Eqs. (7) and (8), together with non-state variables, represent the set of equations to be solved in order to minimise the Gibbs free energy of the system and obtain the equilibrium compositions of the species (ni )."
3,Reactions involved in the SRB,"2.2 Reactions involved in the SRB The possible reactions involved in the SRB are given in Table 1 . The present procedure was used to evaluate various gaseous species such as hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), steam (H2O) and elemental carbon (C) as a solid. The major products of the SRB are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane [3]. By-products like methyl ethyl ketone, isopropyl alcohol, butyric aldehyde are also obtained as a result of dehydrogenation of butanol [32]. Similarly butylene, propylene and ethylene are obtained due to dehydration of butanol [33]. Hydrogenation of alkenes like butylene and ethylene result in the formation of alkanes, e.g., ethane and butane. These by-products are not considered in the present work. The performance of the system was measured in terms of yield and selectivity. The equilibrium conversions of butanol and yield of hydrogen are defined as follows (9) X e ( % ) = ( F bin − F bout ) F bin × 100 (10) Y i ( % ) = F i ( x i × F i ) × 100 where X e is the equilibrium conversion of butanol, F bin and F bout are the molar flow rates of butanol at the inlet and outlet, respectively, Y i is the yield of either hydrogen or carbon monoxide, F i is the molar flow rate of either hydrogen or carbon monoxide at the outlet and x i is the stoichiometric yield, 12 for H2 and 4 for CO. Generally, the definitions of catalyst selectivity differ depending on the convention for describing catalytic reaction. In the ethanol steam reforming reactions, selectivity for hydrogen is usually defined as the molar ratio of hydrogen produced to the ethanol consumed [34]. We defined the selectivity for hydrogen and other gases as follows: (11) S p ( % ) = mol p ∑ mol sp × 100 where molp represents the moles of each product; molsp represents the sum of moles of products. Carbon composition of gas product (C g) is defined as follows [20]: (12) C g = moles of CO + moles of CO 2 + moles of CH 4 moles of C in feed × 100"
4,Results and discussion,"The production of hydrogen by the SRB was examined at different pressures ranging from 1 to 7bar and temperatures between 300 and 900°C at different water-to-butanol feed ratios (WBFR) from 3 to 12 by thermodynamic analysis. Complete conversion of butanol was observed in the considered range of pressures and temperatures, although the selectivity for hydrogen was an important parameter that varied in the studied temperature and pressure range. Selectivity was also influenced by WBFR ratio and pressure."
5,Pressure effects,"3.1 Pressure effects The effect of pressure on steam-reforming performance was examined at WBFR=3 and at different temperatures from 300 to 800°C. By-product methane was formed by hydrogenation via reactions (R-3 and (R-7 to R-10)) at low temperatures around 300°C. WBFR=3 was chosen because at this value the formation of carbon (coke), one of the contributor to methane formation, is significant (R-3). Selectivity for methane formation by reactions (R-7) and (R-9), i.e., by carbon monoxide hydrogenation was higher compared to methane formation from carbon dioxide (R-8) at 300°C and at 1bar. Reaction (R-1) favours formation of carbon monoxide over carbon dioxide. Selectivity for carbon monoxide is lower at higher WBFR=7 (R-2), as a result of water–gas shift reaction (R-6). This would result in decreased amounts of carbon monoxide available for hydrogenation. In order to examine the effect of pressure on methane formation reactions (R-7 to R-9) and determine the contribution of individual reactions to methane formation, WBFR=3 was chosen. 3.1.1 Formation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide Increases in pressure did not positively affect the yield and selectivity for hydrogen and had no effect on conversion, which was already at 100%. Increase in pressure likely shifted the equilibrium towards the methanation reactions (R-7 to R-10) and hence a decrease in yield of hydrogen was observed. Similarly, increases in pressure had a negative effect on the selectivity for hydrogen. Hydrogen yield was maximised at 1bar (Fig. 1 ) for all the temperatures examined. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2 , increases in pressure had a negative effect on the yield and selectivity for carbon monoxide. At low temperatures, with increases in pressure the yield of carbon monoxide decreased to 0.002% and 3.7% at 300 and 500°C respectively. But with increase in temperature the yield of carbon monoxide increased to 18.96 and 95.89% at 600°C and 900°C respectively. The effect of pressure on the SRB process was found to be consistent with that of methanol, ethanol and glycerol [23,35,36]. Contradictory outcomes in the steam reforming of methanol and ethanol have also been reported in the literature. It has been reported that the yield of carbon monoxide changed negligibly with pressure [23], while it has also been reported that selectivity for carbon monoxide decreased with increases in pressure in the partial oxidation of ethanol [22]. 3.1.2 Formation of methane Hydrogenation of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, coke and the decomposition of butanol (Fig. 3 ) at low temperature resulted in the formation of methane. Hydrogenation reactions increased with the increase in pressure at low temperatures [37]. Formation of methane was highest at 300°C. The major contributor to methane formation was the decomposition reaction (R-3). At 1bar the decomposition reaction (R-3) contributed to 43.27% of the total methane formed, followed by coke hydrogenation (R-10) at 33.71%. Hydrogenation of CO (R-7) contributed to 1.98% of the total methane formed while 20.28% of the methane formed was due to the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (R-9). The contribution of carbon (coke) hydrogenation (R-10) increased with pressure increases up to 3bar and decreased upon further increasing the pressure. Methane formed by hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (R-9) and decomposition of butanol (R-3) increased with an increase in pressure [38]. The contribution of the hydrogenation reaction (R-9) was highest at 1bar after which it decreased with increase in pressure. Fig. 4 shows the effect of pressure on methane selectivity in the temperature range of 300–800°C. At all temperatures considered, methane formation increased with an increase in pressure. The highest methane selectivity, 33.60%, was obtained at 300°C, and it decreased with increases in temperature due to steam reforming (R-11) up to 600°C and above 600°C by the dry reforming of methane (R-12). 3.1.3 Formation of carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is formed via two main reactions (R-6 and R-9), the water–gas shift and carbon monoxide methanation [39,40]. The contribution of CO hydrogenation reaction (R-9) is dominant in the production of carbon dioxide at lower temperatures, 300–500°C. As is evident from Fig. 1, hydrogen yield decreased with pressure, hence the contribution of the water–gas shift reaction (R-6) is limited at low temperatures. Simulation results (Fig. 3) indicated that the contribution of hydrogenation reaction (R-9) in the formation of methane was higher as compared to hydrogenation reaction (R-7) at 1bar and 300°C, resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide. The contribution of reaction (R-9) increased with increasing temperatures up to 500°C at 1bar, with a maximum selectivity of 8.65%. Pressure increases also resulted in decreased carbon dioxide formation by hydrogenation (R-8) at 300°C. When temperature was increased further over 500°C, the SRB was the dominant reaction. Increased pressure resulted in an increased steam production as a result of methanation of carbon monoxide (R-7) and carbon dioxide (R-8). Methane produced is steam reformed to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen (R-11). Carbon dioxide selectivity increased at high temperatures (above 500°C) with increased pressure (Fig. 5 ) due to the enhanced water–gas shift reaction (R-6) [39]. At high temperature (800°C) the availability of steam for the methane reforming reaction decreased. Therefore, the carbon dioxide formed was utilised in dry reforming of methane (R-12) at 800°C resulting in a decreased carbon dioxide selectivity compared to the selectivity at 700°C [41]. 3.1.4 Formation of coke The formation of the carbon (coke) is the key parameter to be examined in the SRB. Coke formation during the catalytic steam reforming could lead to deactivation of the catalysts, resulting in low durability and activity. Hence, it is considered in thermodynamic calculations of the SRB. The reactions in the SRB which contribute to coke formation are as follows: (1) Decomposition of aldehydes (R-18) formed by dehydrogenation of butanol (R-17); (2) Decomposition of butanol (R-3); (3) Methane decomposition (R-4); (4) Boudouard reaction (R-5); (5) CO reduction reactions (R-13 and R-14). At low temperatures, reduction of carbon monoxide is thermodynamically unfavourable compared to the Boudouard reaction. The reaction R-4 of methane decomposition is favourable at high temperatures [42]. The effects of temperature, pressure and WBFR on coke formation were examined. The amount of coke formed was examined at WBFR=3, pressure ranging between 1 and 50bar and temperatures between 300 and 800°C. In order to examine the effect of the methane production on coke formation, two cases were formulated for the present purpose: (1) Base case 1 – H2, CO, CO2 and C (2) Base case 2 – H2, CO, CO2, C, and CH4 Fig. 6 shows the effect of pressure on coke formation at WBFR=3. The largest amount of coke was observed at 300°C. In base case 1, 4mol C/mol butanol is produced at 300°C at 1bar and decreased to 1.58mol C/mol butanol at 800°C. At constant temperature, increase in pressure increases coke formation in base case 1. In Base case 1, 1.175mol C/mol butanol was observed at 300°C and a pressure of 1bar. A significant difference in formation of coke was seen in base case 2 compared to base case 1. Coke produced in base case 1, even at 800°C and WBFR=3, was noticeably higher than coke produced in base case 2. Increased pressure has been reported to result in an increase in the hydrogenation of coke (R-10), carbon monoxide (R-7) and carbon dioxide (R-8) as discussed earlier [37,38]; hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (R-7) and carbon dioxide (R-8) produce steam. An increase in steam availability, along with a rise in temperature, resulted in enhanced steam gasification of coke in base case 2. As a result the formation of coke is reduced in base case 2, compared to base case 1. The contribution of individual methane-forming reactions (R-7 to R-10) is shown in Fig. 3. Due to the decrease in hydrogen yield and the increase in methane selectivity, increased pressure is undesirable for the SRB to produce hydrogen. Therefore, SRB was studied at 1bar."
6,Temperature effect,"3.2 Temperature effect 3.2.1 Formation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide The effect of temperature was significant on the SRB. At lower temperatures the yield of hydrogen was low. Hydrogen yields of 2.152% and 19.53% with selectivities of 3.53% and 30.44% at 300 and 500°C respectively, were observed. At low temperatures methane was the major product obtained, probably due to the decomposition of butanol (R-3). Similarly, dehydrogenation of butanol to butyric aldehyde (R-17) is favoured at low temperatures [43]. Butyric aldehyde decomposes (R-18) to methane, carbon monoxide, and ethylene. In the ethanol steam reforming process, aldehydes are formed by dehydrogenation at low temperatures. These aldehydes produce undesirable methane by decomposition [44]. Methane is also produced due to the methanation reaction as result of hydrogenation of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and coke (R-7 to R-10). Fig. 7 shows the selectivity for various gases with respect to temperature at 1bar and WBFR=3. At low temperatures, as methane was the primary product, the selectivity for hydrogen was low. With increases in temperature, the selectivity for hydrogen and carbon monoxide increased due to the steam reformation of methane (R-11). Zhang et al. showed experimentally that, with increasing temperature, the selectivity for hydrogen increases in the steam reforming of glycerol over Ir, Co, Ni supported on CeO2 catalyst [12]. Similar results were reported in steam reforming of ethanol over Ni/CeO2 and Ni/Al2O3 [45]. At higher temperatures (700–900°C), carbon dioxide selectivity decreased due to utilisation in dry reforming of methane (R-12) as a result of decreased steam availability. Yang et al. experimentally reported that the dry reforming reaction (R-12) and the reverse shift reaction (R-15) are accelerated at high temperatures, although the steam reforming of methane was also promoted at high temperatures [46]. 3.2.2 Comparison with experimental results Simulations were carried out for the conditions used by Bimbela et al. to compare the experimental and simulated results [20]. A 0.2107g/h flow rate with a WBFR=4 was used to measure the effect of temperatures from 500 to 750°C on the SRB. The highest yield of hydrogen (0.243g/g butanol) was obtained at 750°C, compared to the 0.056g/g and 0.149g/g obtained by Bimbela in non-catalytic and 23% nickel catalyst systems, respectively. With increase in temperature the yield of carbon monoxide increased along with the hydrogen. In the simulations, the highest yield of 1.125g/g of butanol was observed at 750°C. This was higher compared to 0.183 and 0.371g/g butanol observed in the non-catalytic and 23% nickel catalyst systems shown by Bimbela. At all temperatures under consideration, C g was 100% in the simulation results (Fig. 10), while experimental results showed that C g increased with increasing temperatures from 1% at 550°C to 50.49% at 750°C in the non-catalytic system. In the catalytic system, C g increased from 48.9% to 89.24% with an increase in temperature from 550 to 750°C when a 23% nickel catalyst was used. The authors reported that 0.002g/g and 0.078g/g of the liquid feed were converted to gas in the non-catalytic and catalytic systems, respectively. While the simulation results showed that the feed was completely converted to gas phase in the temperature range under consideration (500–750°C). Fig. 8 shows the yield and selectivity (weight basis) in the SRB simulated for the experimental conditions used by Bimbela. Hydrogen yield increased with increases in temperature up to 600°C, compared to 650°C by Bimbela, and decreased upon further increasing the temperature, similar to the experimental results. Experimental results showed that the selectivity of methane increased with an increase in temperature while the simulation result shows that the methane formation decreased as result of dry reforming with carbon dioxide (R-12 and Fig. 9 ). This resulted in an increased selectivity for hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Molar hydrogen selectivity decreased in the non-catalytic process, with a maximum of 73.68% at 550°C. In the catalytic process the selectivity increased with temperature and attended a maximum of 74.60% at 650°C. On the other hand simulations predicted a maximum hydrogen selectivity of 69.01% at 750°C. 3.2.3 Gas phase carbon composition (C g) The effect of temperature on C g at 1bar and different WBFR is analysed in Fig. 10 . The carbon content of butanol is 64.86% by weight, and the increase of carbon in the gas product means a decrease of carbon loss in the form of coke and the unconverted reactant itself. C g was higher at low temperatures (300°C) due to the increased methane formed as a result of methanation and other methane-forming reactions (R-3 and R-7 to R-10) discussed earlier. At low temperatures, there was also a significant amount of coke formed due to reaction (R-3). C g decreased with increases in temperature as result of the steam reforming methane (R-11) and coke gasification (R-16) up to 600°C at all WBFR. C g increased with increases in WBFR due to enhanced gasification of coke (R-16). In the case of lower WBFR (WBFR=1), the availability of steam to react with methane and coke was lower. Therefore C g was lower, and coke formation was higher. At higher values, like WBFR=3 and 5, C g increased with increased gasification and reforming reactions (R-10 and R-11). At WBFR=3, increase in temperature above 600°C resulted in the carbon selectivity reaching a maximum of 99% due to the increase in the dry reforming of methane (R-12). When temperature was increased above 600°C, C g reached a maximum of 100% at WBFR=5 as a result of the enhanced gasification of coke (R-16) formed during the process. Similar results were obtained experimentally by Wu et al. [41]. They reported that C g increased with an increase in temperature and steam-to-carbon ratio in the steam reforming of bio-oil. The yield of hydrogen and carbon monoxide also depended on the increase in selectivity for carbon monoxide and hydrogen over methane."
7,Effect of water/butanol feed ratio,"3.3 Effect of water/butanol feed ratio This is the most important parameter to be considered in order to evaluate the performance of the SRB. Initially stoichiometric amounts of steam (water/butanol=3) were used to examine the performance of the process. Hydrogen yield of 64%, with 65% wet selectivity, was obtained at 900°C and 1bar pressure. Similarly 95.89% yield with 37.5% wet selectivity was obtained for carbon monoxide. The use of such high temperatures is undesirable due to the adverse effects on the life of the catalyst and the construction materials of the reformers [47]. 3.3.1 Hydrogen and carbon monoxide formation It is important to reduce the concentration of carbon monoxide in the outlet of the reformer in order to produce high-quality hydrogen. By increasing the WBFR, the yield of hydrogen can be increased with a reduction in the selectivity for carbon monoxide by increased water–gas shift reaction. The effect of WBFR on the yields and selectivities for hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane were examined. In steam reforming of oxygenates like glycerol, increase in the water/oxygenate (water/glycerol) ratio increased hydrogen selectivity while carbon monoxide selectivity decreased [48]. The optimum WBFR should be high enough to suppress coke formation and minimise methane formation. Fig. 11 shows the effects of WBFR on the yield and selectivity for hydrogen as a function of temperature at 1bar. Hydrogen yield increased with increases in temperature and WBFR. A maximum yield of 82% was observed, which is equivalent to 10mol H2/mol C4H10O, compared to the stoichiometric value of 12mol H2/mol C4H10O at WBFR=12 and 700°C. The increase in WBFR adversely affected the selectivity for hydrogen in the outlet of the reformer due to the presence of unreacted steam. The best conditions to produce hydrogen will be with excess water if the purification problems can be overcome. At higher WBFR, the yield of hydrogen was lower at 800°C and 900°C as compared to 700°C. Similar behaviour was reported in the steam reforming of glycerol, which was attributed to the reverse water–gas shift reaction (r-WGSR) (R-15) [48]. Fig. 12 shows the effects of WBFR on yield and selectivity for carbon monoxide as a function of temperature at 1bar. The highest yield of carbon monoxide was obtained at the lowest WBFR (WBFR=3), at 900°C, as at this low ratio the quantity of steam was insufficient to form carbon dioxide. When the temperature was increased the selectivity for carbon monoxide increased, but it decreased with an increase in WBFR. Increase in selectivity for carbon monoxide, especially at high temperatures and lower steam-to-carbon ratios is reported in the literature due to decomposition of oxygenated hydrocarbon and r-WGSR (R-15) [26]. In the case of the r-WGSR (R-15), hydrogen is consumed; this should therefore result in a decreased yield, which was not observed. This effect can be attributed to dry reforming of methane (R-12), which is accelerated under these conditions [46]. 3.3.2 Formation of methane Fig. 13 shows the selectivity for methane as a function of temperature for different WBFR at 1bar. The formation of methane was highest at the lowest temperature, 300°C, due to reactions (R-3, R-7 to R-10 and R-18) as discussed earlier. Methane selectivity decreased with increases in temperature and WBFR. The selectivity for steam and methane decreased along with the increases in CO, CO2, and H2 as WBFR was increased. This can be attributed to the methane steam reformation (R-11) to produce CO or CO2 and H2 [49]. At the higher WBFRs of 6:1 and 9:1 and a temperature of 700°C, methane formation was minimised and was completely inhibited at 900°C. At the still higher ratio of 12:1, methane selectivity was less than 5% at a temperature as low as 600°C. 3.3.3 Formation of coke The decreased formation of coke with increase in pressure is highly desirable. But increase in pressure affects hydrogen and carbon monoxide yield adversely. As discussed earlier, the yield of hydrogen and carbon monoxide decreased with increases in pressure, which is undesirable. Therefore, the effect of WBFR on the formation of coke was examined at 1bar pressure and at temperatures of 300–800°C. Formation of coke in the SRB at 1bar in base case 1 and base case 2 respectively is represented in Figs. 14 and 15 . The largest amount of coke was formed at the lower temperature for all WBFR, which shows that the decomposition of butanol is the dominant reaction at the lower temperatures. The largest amount of carbon (coke), 3.991mol C/mol butanol was observed at WBFR=1 and 300°C, which decreased to 3.94mol C/mol butanol with an increase in WBFR to 10 in base case 1. A higher WBFR did not give a significant decrease in coke selectivity. Coke formation was completely inhibited with WBFR=4 at 800°C, higher WBFR (WBFR=10) was required for the same result at temperatures lower than 600°C. In base case 2, 1.17mol C/mol butanol was observed when WBFR=1 was examined at 300°C. Coke formation was completely inhibited at WBFR=7 due to the hydrogenation of carbonaceous deposits to methane at lower temperatures [50]. In base case 2, coke selectivity increased with increases in temperature up to 600°C and decreased upon further increase in temperature up to 800°C. With an increase in temperature, coke formation increased due to an increase in thermal decomposition of butanol (R-3), for WBFR between 1 and 4 [51]. Due to an increase in steam gasification above 600°C, the amount of coke formed was reduced (R-16) [52]. At all temperatures, coke formation in base case 1 were higher than in base case 2. This shows that the formation of methane plays a significant role in the reduction of coke at lower temperatures, 300–500°C. Increases in WBFR had a positive effect on coke inhibition in both the cases, and at high temperatures, although coke elimination was similar in both cases. However, increasing WBFR also had a negative effect on selectivities, due to dilution of the outlet stream. It is important to point out that increasing the WBFR resulted in an increase in quality of the outlet gas by increasing the hydrogen content. But a higher WBFR ratio requires a higher volume for the reactor because of the increased steam volumetric flow, and consumes higher input heat duty because of the greater vaporisation energy."
8,Conclusions,"The operating conditions for the production of high-quality hydrogen by the SRB were optimised with the complete conversion of fuel. The operational parameters considered were WBFR, temperature and pressure. High-quality reformate was obtained that could be directly utilised in solid-oxide fuel cells or as a feed to water–gas shift reactors for gas cleanup for utilisation in polymer–electrolyte fuel cells (PEM). One limitation for PEM operation is that the CO level in the reformed gas feed to the fuel cell is limited to below 10ppm. The differences in H2 and CO production were calculated as functions of WBFR and temperature at 1bar. On the basis of the equilibrium calculations, excluding the higher-hydrocarbon compounds (e.g., alkenes, alcohols and ketones etc.) that are also generated in the process, the optimal operating conditions were found to be between 600 and 800°C at 1bar and a WBFR of 9–12. At these conditions, the yield of hydrogen was maximised, that of methane was minimised and carbon formation was inhibited. Hydrogen yield of 75.13–81.16% and a dry hydrogen selectivity of 68.49–70.89% were obtained. Carbon monoxide yield varied between 44.6 and 52.38%, with a dry selectivity of 12.98–16%. As the carbon monoxide selectivity was lowered, it can be further reduced by gas cleanup using water–gas shift reactors and preferential oxidisers [53]. The optimal operating conditions were evaluated from the thermodynamics viewpoint; however, it should be noted that durability, activity and selectivity of the catalyst, along with side reactions, must be considered from the practical point of view. The thermodynamic study shows that by-products such as coke will form in the SRB. The operation should be controlled to minimise coke formation, or otherwise the catalysts selected must be able to resist the coke formation. It has been shown that Ce-ZrO2 has very good carbon resistance in various hydrogen production processes such as partial oxidation, steam reforming and dry reforming [54–58]."
