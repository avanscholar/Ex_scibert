0,Introduction,"UT-3 thermochemical hydrogen production cycle has been studied both theoretically as well as experimentally since being proposed in 1978 [1]. This cycle has several advantages such as comparatively simple separation of reactants and products and high process efficiency. Also the cycle requires lower operating temperatures than other thermochemical cycles for hydrogen production. Thus concentrated solar thermal or nuclear heat can be used as the heat source. Nakayama et al. [2] built a bench scale plant and operated it to produce hydrogen continuously for the several test runs. General Atomics selected the adiabatic UT-3 cycle [3] as one of the best potential cycles along with iodine–sulfur (I–S) cycle for hydrogen production using nuclear power [4]. The UT-3 process consists of the following four gas–solid reactions: (R1) CaO ( s ) + Br 2 ( g ) → 773 − 873 K CaBr 2 ( s ) + 0.5 O 2 ( g ) (R2) CaBr 2 ( s ) + H 2 O ( g ) → 973 − 1023 K CaO ( s ) + 2 HBr ( g ) (R3) Fe 3 O 4 ( s ) + 8 HBr ( g ) → 473 − 573 K 3 FeBr 2 ( s ) + 4 H 2 O ( g ) + Br 2 (g) (R4) 3 FeBr 2 ( s ) + 4 H 2 O ( g ) → 823 − 873 K Fe 3 O 4 ( s ) + 6 HBr ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) The overall reaction is the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen. Therefore, it requires mainly water and heat as the sources to operate. The four reactions take place in four reactors, each containing the corresponding solid reactant. All solid products from the reactions remain in the reactor for the reverse reactions that convert them back into the original forms. Therefore, only the gaseous reactants and products flow through the reactors, which simplifies the product separation steps. However, these cyclic gas–solid reactions affect the physical stability and chemical reactivity of the solid reactants because of cyclic substantial volume changes between the oxide and bromide forms. The hydrolysis reaction of calcium bromide (R2) is known to be the rate-limiting step [5] as well as the highest temperature reaction. To make matters worse, the large volume expansion of 76% from calcium oxide to calcium bromide [6] and the subsequent sintering of the solid particles plugs the pores in the pellets. This, in turn, hinders the following reaction between calcium bromide and steam. The rate of reaction seems to be enhanced by increasing the reaction temperature since the reaction is endothermic; however, the reaction temperature is limited by the melting point of calcium bromide [7]. For these reasons, numerous attempts have been reported in the literature for developing a durable calcium oxide solid reactant with a fast hydrolysis reaction. The published studies [5,8–11] found that the pellets of calcium oxide dispersed in a calcium titanium oxide matrix showed the best performance. The pellets were synthesized by a procedure based on alkoxide chemistry and sol–gel process. Pore forming agents were added during the process for higher surface area and porosity as described in detail [5,8–11]. Structured inert matrix of calcium titanate (CaTiO3) played a vital role in maintaining the durability of the pellets. The content of calcium oxide in the prepared pellet was about 22.7wt.% since the molar ratio of calcium oxide and calcium titanate in the fresh pellet is 0.71:1. It was found that the maximum bromination conversion was maintained at about 75% for three cycles [9]. The preparation procedure of these pellets, however, is complicated. Also the possibility of decomposition of the inert material, calcium titanate, by HBr was suspected [7]. Moreover, the pellet-type reactant is inherently unfavorable for the gas–solid reactions involving dramatic volume changes of the solid materials since the gas diffusion through the solid product would be restricted due to the reduction of porosity. The repetitive substantial volume change also adversely affects the physical strength of the pellet in the long run. For these reasons, several investigators proposed alternative processes. Lemort et al. [7] proposed a fluidized bed reactor instead of a packed bed reactor to improve the reaction kinetics. Simpsona et al. [6] suggested an innovative concept based on the molten calcium bromide with molten calcium oxide and conducted preliminary experiments. Lee et al. [11] fabricated the calcium oxide pellets via a modified pelletization process using various pore forming agents. They found that the pore size distribution of the pellets is strongly dependant on the type of pore forming agents. They also found that the hydrolysis rate was significantly increased as the pore volume greater than 5μm increased [11]. This finding is in good agreement with the results reported by Sakurai et al. [9]. Subsequently, Lee et al. [12] experimentally developed and evaluated a new film-type calcium oxide reactant on an inert substrate. Their preliminary experimental results showed that a calcium oxide film could be an excellent substitute for a pellet-type reactant if there is a suitable inert substrate with high surface area. In this study, newly developed calcium oxide reactant dispersed and immobilized on a fibrous yttria woven mat was evaluated experimentally. In addition, thermodynamic analysis of the hydrolysis reaction of calcium bromide, the slowest reaction, was conducted using the FactSage software [13]."
1,Thermodynamic analysis of the hydrolysis reaction of calcium bromide,"In order to examine the spontaneity of the reactions in UT-3 cycle, the changes of Gibbs free energy as a function of reaction temperature were calculated using FactSage thermochemical software and databases, as plotted in Fig. 1 . Based on the figure, it is found that the hydrolysis reactions of calcium bromide (R2) and Iron bromide (R4) are thermodynamically unfavorable even at high temperatures while the two bromination reactions, R1 and R3, are favorable. In this study, the hydrolysis of calcium bromide, the slowest and highest temperature reaction, was studied in order to accelerate the reaction and find the optimum conditions. Specifically, the effects of excess steam and reaction temperature on the equilibrium conversion were considered."
2,Effect of excess steam,"2.1 Effect of excess steam Sakurai et al. [14] reported that at least 100 times excess steam per hydrogen yield should be used as a heat carrier if the process was operated in the adiabatic reactors without any other external heat input. Theoretically, the hydrolysis of calcium bromide with excess steam is expected to be favorable according to the Le Chatelier's principle since the chemical equilibrium shifts to the right due to the addition of the reactants at the chemical equilibrium state. Aihara et al. [8] found that the bromination conversion of calcium oxide was well maintained above 863K in the presence of steam. Our simulation results illustrated in Fig. 2 show the effect of excess steam up to 500 times on the bromination reaction of calcium oxide at 873K and 1atm. As shown in the figure, no serious adverse effect of excess steam up to 100 times on the bromination was observed. About 95% conversion was reached even with 100 times of excess steam. On the other hand, the hydrolysis reaction was effected significantly by the excess steam, as shown in Fig. 3 . The conversion was increased with the addition of excess steam as expected according to the Le Chatelier's principle. As a result, about 9.6% conversion was expected under atmospheric pressure and 1000K with 100 times excess steam. This conversion is very close to the value (9.45%) calculated by the relation by Lemort et al. [7]. Greater than 100 times of excess steam would be avoided due to adverse effects on hydrogen and oxygen separation processes as well as the former bromination reaction. Note that the excess steam enhanced the hydrolysis reaction of iron bromide (R4) in the calculation as reported by Lemort et al. [7]. Also no serious adverse effect of the excess steam on the bromination of iron oxide (R3) was observed."
3,Effect of reaction temperature,"2.2 Effect of reaction temperature The hydrolysis conversion is expected to increase with increasing temperature, since the reaction is endothermic. The effect of temperature on the hydrolysis reaction of calcium bromide was calculated with 100 times of excess steam under atmospheric pressure and displayed in Fig. 4 . The conversion is significantly increased with the elevation of temperature, however, it is limited by the melting temperature of 1000K for calcium bromide."
4,Effect of pressure,"2.3 Effect of pressure Higher conversion is expected at lower pressures according to the Le Chatelier's principle because the volume of the gaseous product, HBr, is greater than that of the gaseous reactant, steam, in the hydrolysis reaction (R2). Lemort et al. [7] reported that the conversion was almost completed under 0.1mbar with only 10 times excess water. However, we did not consider the effect of pressure in this study since the low pressure condition is impractical as well as inefficient for large scale production of hydrogen."
5,Considering change of equilibrium states,"2.4 Considering change of equilibrium states The equilibrium conversion is predicted to be low even with excess steam, for example 9.6% with 100 times excess steam at the maximum feasible temperature. However, considering that the gaseous products are removed immediately from the reactor by the gaseous stream as soon as they are produced and as a result the equilibrium state is not reached, the ultimate conversion efficiency may be higher even at atmospheric pressure. This assumption was verified by calculating the effect of consecutive removal of hydrogen bromide (HBr) from the equilibrium conditions. As shown in Fig. 5 , it was observed that the conversion could be completed theoretically by removing the product gas, HBr, from each equilibrium state."
6,Experimental study,
7,Calcium oxide pellets,"3.1 Calcium oxide pellets Calcium oxide pellets were fabricated using the pelletization process presented previously. The procedure was modified based on the process by Aihara et al. [8]. The detailed steps were described in our earlier study [11]. The pore forming agents such as stearic acid, graphite, and cornstarch were used to make the pellets porous. The pellets were approximately 4mm in diameter and 10mm long cylindrical shape."
8,Immobilization of calcium oxide on a yttria fabric,"3.2 Immobilization of calcium oxide on a yttria fabric A new procedure for the immobilization of calcium oxide on a yttria fabric was developed by modifying the process presented earlier [12] and shown in Fig. 6 . The nano-sized precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC; average particle size=70nm) surface treated with stearic acid to enhance dispersibility was selected as the starting material. The PCC was blended with ethyl alcohol by mechanical stirring for 10min and ultrasonicated for another 10min to reduce agglomeration. The suspension was dropped onto a dried yttria fabric (Felt type YF-50 from Zircar Zirconia, Inc., USA) using a transfer pipette. Then the fabric was dried at 100°C for 30min and subsequently sintered at 900°C for 20h in air. During sintering, the PCC on the yttria fabric was converted into calcium oxide. The size of the sintered fabric sample was roughly 30mm (L)×10mm (W)×1.27mm (T)."
9,Characterization,"3.3 Characterization The pore size distributions of calcium oxide pellets were characterized by Quantachrome Autoscan 60 Mercury porosimeter from Quantachrome instruments. The chemical composition and structure of calcium oxide fabric samples were examined by XRD and SEM using Philips MRD X'Pert System and Hitachi S-800, respectively."
10,Cyclic reaction experiments,"3.4 Cyclic reaction experiments The cyclic bromination and hydrolysis reactions were conducted using the experimental set-up illustrated in Fig. 7 . The prepared sample was suspended from a self-constructed precision spring balance in the reactor whose temperature was controlled by a thermocouple installed right under the sample. The temperatures for bromination and hydrolysis reaction were selected as 600°C and 700°C, respectively, based on the thermodynamic analysis and previous studies. For the bromination reaction, bromine and water were supplied while only steam was supplied for the hydrolysis reaction. The bromine concentration for bromination and water concentration for hydrolysis were 2.6mol% and 90mol%, respectively. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas of the reactant gases and a purge gas of the spring balance. The conversion was calculated by the following equation [5]: (1) X = M CaO ( W − W o ) W o R CaO ( M CaBr 2 − M CaO ) The weight change of the sample, W−W0, was determined using the spring constant and deflection of the spring measured by a microscope."
11,Experimental results and discussion,
12,Calcium oxide pellet,"4.1 Calcium oxide pellet The effects of various pore forming agents on the characteristics and performance of pellets were investigated and evaluated preliminarily in our earlier paper [11]. Afterward, cyclic experimental tests were conducted using one of the samples with excellent characteristics in order to see the practical feasibility of the pellets. Fig. 8 shows cyclic conversion profiles of the bromination and hydrolysis reactions. It took less than 10min to reach the maximum conversion in the bromination reaction. The hydrolysis reaction was slower as compared to bromination reaction. Degradation was observed during the cyclic operations. Seventy percent conversion was attained in the first cycle, while about 50% conversion was achieved in the second. It was also observed that the hydrolysis rate was retarded in the second cycle. In order to investigate the mechanism of degradation, the changes in the pore size distributions after bromination and hydrolysis processes were measured using a Mercury porosimeter. As shown in Fig. 9 , the pore volume was reduced by almost half in the process of bromination possibly due to expansion of the solid reactant. Most of the pores greater than 5μm, however, were regenerated after hydrolysis, while pores less than 5μm weren't. From the changes in the pore volume distribution, it was ascertained that a reduction in the pore volume leads to the degradation of the chemical reactivity in the cyclic operation."
13,Calcium oxide on a yttria fabric,"4.2 Calcium oxide on a yttria fabric The calcium oxide particles attached well on the yttria fibers in the fresh sintered sample since no particles fell off from shaking or slight impact. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the fresh and brominated samples are shown in Fig. 10 . According to the XRD data, it was confirmed that all of the calcium carbonate was converted to calcium oxide during the sintering and most of the calcium oxide reacted with bromine to form calcium bromide through the bromination reaction. The cyclic conversion profile of the bromination and hydrolysis reactions is shown in Fig. 11 . About 85% conversion was obtained in 10min of bromination, and it was maintained at the same level through the fourth cycle. The hydrolysis rate was about 20% higher as compared with that of calcium oxide pellets in our studies [11] and comparable to that of the calcium oxide pellets in the other study [9]. SEM images of the bare yttria fabric, fresh calcium oxide fabric sample, and brominated sample are displayed in Fig. 12 . The diameter of the yttria fiber in the original fabric is approximately in the range of 8–10μm. As illustrated in the Fig. 12(b), the surface of the yttria fiber in a fresh sample was tightly covered by interconnected calcium oxide particles with a few hundred nanometer diameter. The changes in the structure of the sample by the bromination reaction were very noticeable, as shown in Fig. 12(c). After bromination, it was observed that the volume of the particles was expanded from calcium oxide to calcium bromide and the brominated particles were merged or overlapped. The amount of calcium oxide in the fresh fabric sample was about 11wt.%, which is almost half of the quantity in the calcium oxide pellet. Lesser inert material is preferable to reduce the preparation cost and operational energy. For this reason, an attempt was made to increase the calcium oxide content through repetitive impregnation steps since it was expected that the content of calcium oxide in the sintered fabric would increase. The repeated impregnation steps resulted in a much higher calcium oxide content in sample (22wt.%). Cyclic performance of the samples thus prepared was examined for the first cycle. The results for the samples with various calcium oxide contents (8.7, 10.7, 11.9, 22.0wt.%) are compared in Fig. 13 . As shown in the figure, the hydrolysis rate was retarded by nearly a factor of two as the content increased by two times, while the maximum bromination conversion was not affected much."
14,Conclusions,"The hydrolysis reaction of calcium oxide known as the rate-limiting step in UT-3 thermochemical hydrogen production cycle was analyzed thermodynamically to find the optimum condition and speed up the reaction rate. Various reaction conditions such as temperature and excess steam were considered as parameters in the study. Among them, the effect of excess steam on the equilibrium conversion was significant and the reaction temperature was limited due to the melting point of calcium bromide. By continuously removing the product gas, it was found that the conversion could be completed theoretically. The hypothesis was found to be true based on the experimental tests. An inexpensive and straightforward calcium oxide immobilization process on a yttria fibrous fabric was developed. The performance was evaluated by cyclic bromination and hydrolysis reactions. Based on the experimental results in the cyclic reactions, the calcium oxide on the yttria fabric had continuous higher reactivity in the bromination reaction and the rate of hydrolysis reaction was comparable to or faster than that of the calcium oxide pellets in the previous studies."
