0,Introduction,"The anaerobic digestion of biodegradable waste (bio-waste) to provide methane is used as a source of sustainable energy that could reduce dependency on fossil fuels. However, since methane has relatively low energy density as a fuel and is a powerful greenhouse gas (Zaks et al., 2011), attention has recently focused on alternative uses for bio-waste. One of the more attractive of these is the anaerobic fermentation of bio-waste to produce high value bio-chemicals, such as alcohols and short-chain carboxylic acids (SCCAs, C2–C5) (Holtzapple and Granda, 2009). Unfortunately, impurities are generated from the bio-waste feedstock during the fermentation process, and the high hydrophilicity of SCCAs makes separation and purification difficult (Singhania et al., 2013). This means that SCCAs derived from bio-waste can only be used in situations where purity is unimportant, such as providing a carbon source for biological nutrient removal in wastewater treatment (Lee et al., 2014). Medium-chain carboxylic acids (MCCAs, usually C6–C12) have a higher energy density than SCCAs and their more hydrophobic nature facilitates downstream processing and purification (Spirito et al., 2014). Chain elongation (CE), which can be achieved by providing an electron donor (e.g., alcohol) to induce reverse β-oxidation, is a feasible way to transform SCCAs into MCCAs (Marshall et al., 2013). Attempts to optimize CE have, so far, focused on three main aspects of the process. Firstly, efforts have been made to improve the yield of MCCAs by reducing hydraulic retention time (HRT) (Grootscholten et al., 2013a), employing in-line extraction processes (Agler et al., 2012; Ge et al., 2015) and introducing bacteria that favor the required metabolic pathways (Weimer et al., 2015). Secondly, the suitability of different substrates has been explored. Acetate and ethanol have both been used as substrates for CE (Grootscholten et al., 2013b; Steinbusch et al., 2011). When acetate was replaced by propionate, Odd-carbon-number carboxylates, mainly n-valerate and n-heptanoate, were the major products (Grootscholten et al., 2013c). Thirdly, the efficiency of different electron donors has been evaluated. Hydrogen (Steinbusch et al., 2011), ethanol (Vasudevan et al., 2014), lactate (Zhu et al., 2015) and electrons produced bioelectrochemically (Van Eerten-Jansen et al., 2013) have all been used as electron donors for CE. González-Cabaleiro et al. (2013) showed that the reduction of SCCAs to MCCAs using ethanol and lactate as the electron donor were thermodynamically and kinetically feasible since there is no biochemical bottleneck in the conversion of acetate to n-butyrate at neutral pH. However, a kinetic limitation arises with unfeasibly low acetoacetyl-CoA concentrations required by the condensation reaction of two acetyl-CoA when hydrogen was used as electron donor, suggesting that hydrogen may not suitable as electron donor in chain elongation. Steinbusch et al. (2011) found that when hydrogen instead of ethanol was added into chain elongation system, more complicated product structure but lower carbon efficiency were obtained. When syngas (hydrogen/carbon dioxide) was utilized as substrate, caproate and caprylate could be synthesized with quite low concentration (Zhang et al., 2013). Non-uniform reports indicated that the way of hydrogen participating in chain elongation need deeper insight. A study by Steinbusch et al. (2011), suggested that not only the nature of the electron donor, but also the ratio of electron donor to electron acceptor might influence the structure and yield of CE products. As reported in the cited paper (Bornstein and Barker, 1948; Weimer and Stevenson, 2012), the effect of alcohol-to-acid ratio from 12:1 to 1:1 and 6.35:1 to 0.78:1 were evaluated on the pure cultures Clostridium kluyveri strain 3231B and Clostridium kluyveri strain K.l respectively, the results showed when there was excess ethanol, caproate was the main product and little butyrate accumulated, and vice versa. By now, a systematic evaluation about the effect of alcohol-to-acid ratio on the mixed culture elongation reaction is still limited. Steinbusch et al. (2011) studied the effect of different electron donor on the product structure, however, the influence of different ethanol to acetate ratio was not specified. Ge et al. (2015) adopted different organic lording rates (OLRs) by using a mixture of yeast-fermentation beer to attain different ethanol to butyrate ratios, then, the author discussed the influence of ethanol to butyrate ratio on the caproate production; but the ethanol to butyrate ratio was not controlled or set systematically in their research. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the ratio of ethanol to acetate affects yield and product structure in CE reactions with mixed culture. The effect of varying the substrate concentration, while maintaining the same ratio of alcohol to acid, was also investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,CE incubation,"2.1 CE incubation Using a carbon substrate concentration of 300mM, four different mole ratios of ethanol (EtOH) to acetic acid (HOAc), denoted by r E/A, were assessed: r E/A =1:2 (EtOH, 50mM; HOAc, 100mM); r E/A =1:1 (EtOH, 75mM; HOAc, 75mM); r E/A =2:1 (EtOH, 100mM; HOAc, 50mM); and r E/A =3:1 (EtOH, 112.5mM; HOAc, 37.5mM). To evaluate the effect of substrate concentration, a fifth protocol was used: r E/A =2:1 (150mM) (EtOH, 50mM; HOAc, 25mM) with a carbon substrate concentration of 150mM. All the chemicals used in the study were of analytical grade or better. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate and a control experiment, using only inoculum, was carried out in duplicate. The CE reactors were flasks with effective volume of 1L, equipped with rubber stoppers and aluminum caps, which had been purged with high purity (99.999%) nitrogen gas. The inoculum was an enrichment derived from anaerobic sludge obtained from a mesophilic reactor treating paper mill wastewater and the ratio of inoculation to substrate was 2:1, based on volatile solids (VS). 500mL medium was added in each flask, before inoculation, the volume of headspace were about 440, 420, 420, 430, 430, 500mL for group from blank to r E/A =2:1 (150mM), respectively. The reaction was carried out in batch mode and the temperature was set at 30±1°C. In order to avoid toxicity of undissociated carboxylates at low pH (Agler et al., 2011; Spirito et al., 2014), when the pH dropped below 6.0 on day 24, all the flasks were opened and the pH was retuned to 7.0±0.1 with 2.0M NaOH manually, and then the flasks was purged by high purity (99.999%) nitrogen gas and sealed. Thus, the pH was maintained at 6.0–7.0 throughout the reaction. In period I and before day 50 in period II, every 3 or 4days, 2mL of liquid and 1mL gas were taken out for various indices testing from every flask, after then, the sampling frequency was adjusted to 6 or 7days a time."
3,Medium,"2.2 Medium Ethanol and acetate were added to the basic culture medium prepared by dissolving NaHCO3, 5040mg; NH4H2PO4, 3600mg; MgCl2·6H2O, 330mg; MgSO4·7H2O, 200mg; KCl, 150mg; CaCl2·2H2O, 200mg; MnCl2·4H2O, 0.5mg; H3BO3, 0.05mg; ZnCl2, 0.05mg; CuCl2, 0.03mg; Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.01mg; CoCl2·6H2O, 1mg; NiCl2·6H2O, 0.1mg; Na2SeO3, 0.05mg; biotin, 0.02mg; pyridoxine-HCl, 0.1mg; thiamine-HCl·2H2O, 0.05mg; D-Ca-pantothenate, 0.05mg; folic acid, 0.02mg; riboflavin, 0.05mg; nicotinic acid, 0.05mg; p-aminobenzoic acid, 0.05mg; vitamin B12, 0.001mg; and lipoic acid, 0.05mg in water (1 L). 2-BES (10.5g/L) was added to the medium to inhibit methanogenesis, as reported by Zinder et al. (1984)."
4,Chemical analyses,"2.3 Chemical analyses The contents of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane in the reactor headspace were determined using a gas chromatograph (GC 9800, Shanghai Kechuang Instrument Co., Shanghai, China). The total gas pressure was measured using a digital manometer (Testo 512, Lenzkirch, Germany). The partial pressure of each gaseous species was then calculated correspondingly. The concentrations of carboxylic acids (C2–C8) and ethanol were measured using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890, Santa Clara, California, USA), equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30m×0.25mm DB WAX polyethylene glycol capillary column. The column operating temperature was held at 70°C for 3min, increased by 10°C/min to 180°C, and then maintained at 180°C for 6.5min. The injector and detector temperatures were both set at 280°C. Prior to injection, the liquid samples were centrifuged at 16,000rpm for 10min in a high-speed refrigerated centrifuge (TL-18M, Shanghai, China), filtered through a 0.45μm microfilter membrane, and acidified with 3% (v/v) phosphoric acid. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved nitrogen (DN) in the supernatant of the above centrifuged liquid samples were determined using a TC/TN analyzer (TOC-VCPH, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The elemental analyses of inoculum and biomass harvested at day 119 were determined using an elemental analyzer (Vario EL III, Elementar, Hanau, Germany) operating in C, H, N mode."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Performance of chain elongation,"3.1 Performance of chain elongation 3.1.1 Variation of even-carbon-number carboxylates The variation of carboxylates (acetate, n-butyrate, n-caproate, n-caprylate, propionate, n-valerate, n-heptanoate) and ethanol during the 119-day reaction period are shown in Fig. 1 . Following pH adjustment, production of MCCAs (C6–C8) increased greatly and the reaction period was, therefore, divided into two parts: period I (before pH adjustment, indicated by the dash-dot line) and period II (after pH adjustment, indicated by the dash-dot line). The concentration of CE products for r E/A =3:1 clearly exceeded that of all other groups. The highest concentration of n-caproate (5222±720mg/L) was achieved on day 28 for r E/A =3:1. At the same time point, maximum concentrations of n-caproate were 3556±387mg/L for r E/A =2:1 and 1944±61mg/L for r E/A =1:1. For r E/A =2:1 (150mM), the maximum concentration of n-caproate (569±78mg/L) was achieved on day 52. During period II, the average n-caproate concentrations for r E/A =1:2, r E/A =1:1, r E/A =2:1, r E/A =3:1 and r E/A =2:1 (150mM) were 498±54, 1324±50, 2232±33, 3033±98 and 431±70mg/L, respectively. The average n-caproate concentrations for r E/A =2:1 and r E/A =3:1 were comparable to those reported in the literature (Table 1 ). It is of note that n-caprylate appeared in the reactors containing r E/A =2:1 and r E/A =3:1 on day 24, and appeared 56days later in the reactor containing r E/A =1:1. n-Caprylate was only formed when the n-caproate concentration had become relatively high or with some time lag. This phenomenon has also been observed by others (Roddick and Britz, 1997; Steinbusch et al., 2011). In the present study, when n-caprylate appeared in reactors containing r E/A =1:1, r E/A =2:1 and r E/A =3:1, the concentrations of n-caproate had reached 1346±55, 2814±484 and 3852±310mg/L, respectively. Accordingly, average n-caprylate concentrations in the three reactors during the whole period were 108±15, 221±19 and 370±21mg/L for the above three groups. No n-caprylate was detected in the reactors containing r E/A =1:2, r E/A =2:1 (150mM) or in the control experiment. 3.1.2 Generation of odd-carbon-number carboxylates It is known that n-valerate and n-heptanoate can be synthesized by reverse β-oxidation, using propionate and ethanol as substrates (Grootscholten et al., 2013c). Although no propionate was added to the any of the reactors, it was produced in each incubation (Fig.1f), including the control reaction (up to 826mg/L), if the reaction had commenced. Small quantities of odd-carbon-number carboxylates were also found among the products in a study by Steinbusch et al. (2011), in which ethanol and acetate were used as the substrates. Propionate concentrations varied little during period II, and were similar in each incubation experiment. n-Valerate concentrations showed the same trend as those of propionate, except that no n-valerate was detected in the reactor with r E/A =1:2. In the four experiments with 300mM total carbon, propionate and n-valerate concentrations showed an inverse relationship; the reactor with the highest alcohol to acid ratio (r E/A =3:1) had the most n-valerate and the least propionate. The highest concentration of n-valerate was present in the reactor with r E/A =3:1 (average value=1224±22mg/L during period II). Although the standard deviations of n-valerate concentration was high, but the analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed indeed significant difference existed among the experiment groups (p<0.05). n-Heptanoate was only detected in the reactors with r E/A =3:1 and r E/A =2:1, also, there was statistically significant difference between the two groups (t-Test, p<0.05). The presence of n-heptanoate may be attributable to the high ratio of alcohol to acid. So far, most research on CE has focused on n-caproate production probably due to the specificity of n-heptanoate was not as high as n-caproate in that even chain elongation will always occur due to the 1/6 production of acetate. n-Heptanoate, however, is more hydrophobic and has a higher energy density than n-caproate when used as a biodiesel precursor and could also be used for antimicrobial and bioplastic production. Only Grootscholten et al. (2013c) have attempted to synthesize n-heptanoate by using propionate and ethanol as the substrates for CE. Propionate can be derived from several common carbon sources, including saccharides and saccharide-rich waste such as sugarcane bagasse (Zhu et al., 2012). Odd-carbon-number carboxylates such as propionate and n-valerate are naturally derived from protein by a combination of deamination and oxidation reactions. Propionate fermentation of protein-rich waste, including municipal sludge, livestock manure, and fish processing residues, has been successfully achieved by controlling the pH (Yuan et al., 2006) or C/N ratio (Liu et al., 2008). Propionate is also an excellent inhibitor of methanogenesis, eliminating the need for additional inhibitors. It is entirely feasible to suggest that a process using propionate derived from protein-rich waste, together with an electron donor derived from bio-waste, would be a promising way to produce n-heptanoate and other odd-carbon-number carboxylates. 3.1.3 Estimation of inoculum hydrolysis Odd-carbon-number carboxylates were present in all reactors and propionate was present in the control reactor (Fig.1f). When the carbon balance was calculated without taking inoculum hydrolysis into account, the total carbon in the products generated was 1.08–1.45 times greater than the total carbon present in the added acetate and alcohol. Since the inoculum was obtained from a reactor treating paper mill wastewater, the fresh sludge was enriched with polysaccharides and proteins that could be hydrolyzed during the chain elongation. Therefore, hydrolysis of materials contained in the added inoculum, might have served as an additional source of carbon. A similar phenomenon has been reported before by Ge et al. (2015). Both total nitrogen (DN) and total organic carbon (DOC) in all six reactors peaked between day 28 and day 43 (Fig. 3 ). The amounts of nitrate and nitrite are extremely low in anaerobic systems, so ammonium nitrogen approximates to total nitrogen (Sommers, 1977). Protein hydrolysis was, therefore, the only source of DN in the reactors. The production of equivalent C (the number of moles of carbon per mole of product, mole C/mole, defined as Ceq) from inoculum can thus be calculated from the DN data and the C/N elemental composition of the inoculum, as shown in Table 3. The rate of hydrolysis was similar in all reactors, varying in the range of 42.2±1.6% to 57.5±11.4%. Previous reports have argued that a high concentration of ethanol (>40mM) would suppress hydrolysis (Chen and Jin, 2006). In our study, however, adding as much as 112.5mM ethanol did not inhibit hydrolysis, and the hydrolysis rates in the control experiment and in the reactor with r E/A =3:1 were similar. This phenomenon could result from fast depletion of ethanol. The toxic effects of high VFAs concentration were studied and reported by several authors and the resulting drop in pH was generally considered to be the main cause of inhibition (Babel et al., 2004). Veeken et al. (2000) distinguished the inhibitory effect of pH and VFAs by separate controlling of both pH and VFAs, the results revealed that the hydrolysis rate constant was pH dependent but was not related to the VFAs. In our study, inhibition of hydrolysis did not happen could be attributed to the neutral pH. To date, the influence of hydrogen partial pressure on fermentation product spectrum is still not definite. In the latest review of Arslan et al. (2016), the authors summarized the research about the relationship of hydrogen partial pressure and fermentation product spectrum and found “no obvious trends can be derived for the impact of elevated hydrogen partial pressure on the short chain carboxylate levels and composition”. Rodríguez et al. (2006) argued that acetate instead of butyrate, became the main product until the hydrogen partial pressure reached 0.4atm.pH is an another parameter that determine the main product of fermentation. Arslan et al. (2016) summarized a general situation that butyrate became the main fermentation product when pH<6 under carbon dioxide other than hydrogen atmosphere. In general, it can be said that at low pH (<6) more n-butyrate is produced, at pH 6∼8 more acetate, and at a high pH (>8) more propionate. This could be verified by lots of studies (Chen et al., 2007; González-Cabaleiro et al., 2015). Here, we tried to estimate the butyrate production from inoculum hydrolysis and the subsequent fermentation at certain hydrogen partial pressure (Supplementary Material (Fig. S1)). In brief, it is hardly to figure out which hydrolysis product would become the main product. However, when taking low hydrogen partial pressure and neutral pH regulation into account, it seems more reasonable to speculate that acetate would be the main product during the inoculum hydrolysis in our study. Assuming that all Ceq derived from hydrolysis was converted to acetate, an additional 106.3±4.7, 101.3±1.6, 113.2±6.2, 113.6±6.4, 127.6±5.4 and 86.5±9.9mmoles acetate were added to reactors containing control, r E/A =1:2, r E/A =1:1, r E/A =2:1, r E/A =3:1 and r E/A =2:1 (150mM), respectively. This effectively decreased the alcohol to acid ratios to 1:4.0, 1:2.5, 1:1.6, 1:1.5, and 1:2.2, respectively. The lower alcohol to acid ratios suggests a deficiency of electron donors and could explain the higher levels of n-butyrate compared with longer carbon chain carboxylates."
7,The function of hydrogen in chain elongation,"3.2 The function of hydrogen in chain elongation 3.2.1 The importance of reductive environment provided by hydrogen As the presence of 10.5g/L 2-BES in the mixed culture, both hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis could be inhibited in the previous stage. However, the methane concentration was high (20–45%) in period I, perhaps due to the granular sludge used as inoculums that reduced the accessibility of 2-BES, resulting in delay for occurrence of inhibition. In fact, the cumulative production of methane changed little after day 2 for the five experiment groups. The cumulative production of methane were 253.0±0.7, 283.7±18.8, 326.2±11.4, 339.3±6.2, 336.7±6.7, 198.8±16.3mL at the end of period I for the six groups, respectively. The inhibition continued until day 50, after then, the inhibition may be declined perhaps the degradation of 2-BES or the adaption of the microbiome happened, causing revitalization of the methanogens. This phenomenon has been reported before (Zinder et al., 1984). From Fig. 2, the methane concentration increased slowly over time but was inversely related to the hydrogen concentration. Since acetoclastic methanogens are more vulnerable to inhibitors (Siggins et al., 2011), the methane increasing could be mainly attributed to the syntrophic carboxylate oxidation-hydrogenotrophic methanogenessis (Eqs. (4) and (5)) when the hydrogen partial pressure falls below 10Pa. It is, therefore, reasonable to keep hydrogen levels high enough to prevent MCCAs oxidation and shunting of Ceq into syntrophic carboxylates oxidation-hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in case the revival of methanogens happens. On day 100, the hydrogen pressures in the reactors with r E/A =2:1 and r E/A =3:1 decreased to 17 and 48Pa, respectively, which was the highest level of all five reactors. The decreasing hydrogen concentration weaken the reductive environment which should be met to prevent the oxidation, and thus removal, of carboxylates, jointing with the revival of methanogens, enables the syntrophic carboxylates oxidation-hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis unimpededly. This could be well demonstrated by the reverse variation of carbon dioxide and methane versus hydrogen (Fig. 2). As shown in Eqs. (1)–(5), if absolute concentrations of ethanol or hydrogen are insufficient while acetate is abundant, the first and key step of chain elongation to produce n-butyrate will be disfavored and methanogenesis will be favored. Thence, the importance of reductive environment in chain elongation reactor microbiome has been emphasized by Spirito et al. (2014): (1) C 2 H 3 O 2 - + C 2 H 5 OH = C 4 H 7 O 2 - + H 2 O Δ G r ⊕ ′ = - 38.4 kJ / mol (2) C 4 H 7 O 2 - + C 2 H 5 OH = C 6 H 11 O 2 - + H 2 O Δ G r ⊕ ′ = - 39.5 kJ / mol (3) C 2 H 3 O 2 - + H + = CH 4 + CO 2 Δ G r ⊕ ′ = - 37.2 kJ / mol (4) C 2 H 3 O 2 - + H + + 2 H 2 O = 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 Δ G r ⊕ ′ = + 91.2 kJ / mol (5) CO 2 + 4 H 2 = CH 4 + 2 H 2 O Δ G r ⊕ ′ = - 128.4 kJ / mol 3.2.2 The possible way of hydrogen participating in chain elongation During the period from day 0 to day 46, the concentration of hydrogen were between 2.44±0.60% and 0.43±0.048% for r E/A =3:1, between 1.73±0.10% and 0.11±0.001% for r E/A =2:1, between 1.13±0.19% and 0.072±0.006% for r E/A =1:1, between 0.73±0.043% and 0.035±0.027% for r E/A =1:2, and between 0.65±0.15% and 0.028±0.015% for r E/A =2:1 (150mM) (Fig.2c). The concentration of hydrogen thus decreased as r E/A and the substrate concentration reduced. Electron equivalent calculation was based on the number of electrons contained in the reduced compounds (mole/mole, 44 for caprylate, 32 for caproate, 20 for butyrate, 8 for methane, 2 for hydrogen, 8 for acetate, 12 for ethanol). The total amount e− equivalent of chain elongation products increased as hydrogen was consumed from day 14 to 24 (Table 2 ). Hydrogen was the sole electron donor after day 7 since ethanol was exhausted, i.e., the increasing of e− equivalent in products of chain elongation could only be attributed to hydrogen. The reduced amount of hydrogen e− equivalent was less than the increased amount of product e− equivalent probably because the fractional production of n-butyrate from inoculum hydrolysis that induced additional e− equivalent increment (From the perspective of electron balance, the amounts of butyrate from hydrolysis were 4.40±0.53, 8.87±0.67, 10.18±0.99, 16.83±1.57, 2.38±0.65mmoles corresponding to r E/A from 1:2 to 3:1). Hydrogen is not viable electron donors for chain elongation enzymatically (González-Cabaleiro et al., 2013). But from the study of Steinbusch et al. (2011), in which the batch experiment was conducted for 105days, hydrogen may act as electron donor indirectly to continue chain elongation and n-caprylate was produced in the latter reaction stage. Zhang et al. (2013) utilized syngas (hydrogen/carbon dioxide) as substrate to conduct chain elongation, caproate and caprylate could be synthesized but with relatively low concentration. It may be inferred that once the added ethanol was depleted, new ethanol still could be formed either through homoacetogenesis of converting hydrogen and carbon dioxide into acetate, followed by sluggish alcoholization of acetate to ethanol (Spirito et al., 2014), or through alcoholization of acetate to ethanol by hydrogen directly, so that chain elongation could continue."
8,Optimal alcohol to acid ratio,"3.3 Optimal alcohol to acid ratio 3.3.1 Evaluation of the performance of the five groups in chain elongation At the end of the reaction (119days), three metrics were used to compare the performance of CE (Table 4 ). (1) Total alkyl groups, the sum of methyl and methylene groups in the products of carbon elongation, T-alkyl (mmol)=(3×C4)+(4×C5)+(5×C6)+(6×C7)+(7×C8). (2) Average MCCA length (AMCL)=T-alkyl (mmol)/Total MCCAs (mmol)+1, where “1” represents the carboxylate group of the MCCAs. Here MCCAs are broadly defined to include n-butyrate. (3) MCCAs/(EtOH+HOAc), the ratio of MCCAs (Ceq) to ethanol and acetate (Ceq) that were added initially. Metrics (1) and (2) were used by Weimer et al. (2015), but are assigned different meanings in the present study. Taking into account the carbon balance, and assuming that all of the carbon atoms from ethanol and acetate are converted to MCCAs and that no other exogenous substrate takes part in chain elongation, the theoretical value for MCCAs/(EtOH+HOAc) would be “1”. In the present study, the values of MCCAs/(EtOH+HOAc) for the five reactors could be roughly divided into three groups. The reactors with r E/A =1:2, r E/A =1:1 and r E/A =2:1 (150mM) shared some similarities. The MCCAs/(EtOH+HOAc) values were all less than 1 (0.39, 0.75, and 0.89, respectively), signifying that a proportion of the carbon from ethanol and acetate, perhaps fractional acetate (after day 50, methanogenesis was possible because of acclimation and the absence of ethanol), was consumed by methanogenesis instead of CE. This is confirmed by the methane profile (Fig.2b), which shows that the concentration of methane is inversely related to the value of MCCAs/(EtOH+HOAc). For the reactor with r E/A =2:1, the value of MCCAs/(EtOH+HOAc) is close to the theoretical value, suggesting that nearly all of the carbon from ethanol and acetate was used in chain elongation and that no other exogenous carbon source contributed. For the reactor with r E/A =3:1, the MCCAs/(EtOH+HOAc) value was 24% greater than the theoretical value, suggesting that a proportion of the carbon was derived from exogenous substances, with inoculum hydrolysis being the likely candidate. As shown in Table 4, the reactor with r E/A =3:1 had the largest T-alkyl value (148.9mmol) and the longest AMCL (5.03), suggesting that these conditions were the most effective with respect to CE. When the values of T-alkyl and AMCL are greater, the hydrophobicity of the products is higher and they are, therefore, more easily separated from the aqueous phase. From the viewpoint of carbon efficiency (Fig. 4 ), higher carbon efficiency were inclined to higher alcohol to acid ratio, and not only be influenced by alcohol to acid ratio, but also by the substrate concentration. The two groups with the same alcohol to acid ratio shared different carbon efficiency, namely, 85.54±3.25% for r E/A =2:1 (300mM) and 61.33±5.40% for r E/A =2:1 (150mM). The highest carbon efficiency, 103.25±4.32%, was appeared in group r E/A =3:1. The abnormally high carbon efficiency (above 100%) for r E/A =3:1 revealed that a certain amount Ceq derived from inoculum participated in chain elongation. 3.3.2 Effect of alcohol to acid ratio on carbon distribution of products It was found that the alcohol to acid ratio influenced the carbon distribution of the products indirectly but significantly. With increasing alcohol to acid ratios, the product structure became more complex, except in the experiment with r E/A =2:1 (150mM). The reactor with r E/A =3:1 had the most complex product structure (Fig. 4). In addition, the specificity for caproate in our study was not as high as continuous system with short HRT (Grootscholten et al., 2013a) or with product extraction (Ge et al., 2015). This properly because in continuous system enables specific and stationary microbiomes to remain active, resulting in high specificities of some metabolites. Conversely, in batch system, the dominant microbiomes evolve temporally, leading to more and more complicated product structure with low specificities. The alcohol to acid ratio has a profound effect on product structure. As proposed by Weimer and Stevenson (2012), reduction of acetate could be a key step that opens up a pathway to the production of high energy density products, such as longer chain carboxylates. González-Cabaleiro et al. (2013) suggested that higher ethanol concentrations would favor the first step of converting acetate to n-butyrate. However, Ge et al. (2015) proposed that ethanol: n-butyrate=2:1, i.e. ethanol: acetate=4:1, would be an optimum ratio because greater value can be generated when ethanol is maximally used for chain elongation into n-butyrate (resulting in a higher n-caproate/ethanol ratio) rather than converted by anaerobic oxidation into acetate and subsequently elongated. The carbon balance (Fig. 5 ) showed that 39.5%, 1.9%, 2.4%, 4.9%, 7.5%, and 7.6% of the total Ceq for blank, r E/A =1:2, r E/A =1:1, r E/A =2:1, r E/A =3:1 and r E/A =2:1 (150mM), respectively, was missing. The missing Ceq is probably attributable to biomass production by the microbiome and has been observed in other studies (Grootscholten et al., 2013a; Steinbusch et al., 2011). 3.3.3 The lower substrate concentration was not conducive to CE To achieve a high carbon efficiency and desirable product composition, a high value of r E/A seems to be advantageous when the substrate concentration is 300mM but not when the substrate concentration is 150mM. When comparing r E/A =2:1 (300mM) with r E/A =2:1 (150mM), there were large differences in carbon efficiency and product composition. For r E/A =2:1 (300mM), a variety of C4–C8 carboxylates were produced, but n-heptanoate and n-caprylate were absent for r E/A =2:1 (150mM). These data suggest that not only r E/A, but also the amount of substrate, influences chain elongation. The reason for this might lie in the growth characteristics of the CE bacteria. For example, Clostridium kluyveri was reported to be the dominant species in an MCCA-producing reactor and may be responsible for n-caproate production (Steinbusch et al., 2011). Studies by Barker (1947) indicated that the growth of C. kluyveri is sensitive to, and proportional to, substrate concentration. Weimer and Stevenson (2012) observed that the growth of ruminal C. kluyveri strain 3231B increased with increasing ethanol concentration up to 200mM and was favored by an initial fixed acetate concentration of 120mM. The low carbon efficiency value and simpler product structure in the reactor with r E/A =2:1 (150mM) could thus be attributed to inadequate substrate. Taking into account the three metrics as well as the carbon efficiency and inhibition of methanogenesis, a higher alcohol to acid ratio was found to favor CE and it would be reasonable to recommend an alcohol to acid ratio >2:1. The substrate concentration should also be relatively high, that is, 300mmol/L Ceq was certainly superior to 150mmol/L."
9,Conclusions,"The present study has demonstrated an alcohol to acid ratio >2:1, together with a substrate concentration (300mmol/L Ceq), is beneficial for CE. When ethanol was depleted, hydrogen could act as electron donor indirectly by converting carbon dioxide into acetate through homoacetogenesis followed by alcoholization of acetate to ethanol, or through alcoholization of acetate to ethanol. The hydrolysis of unacclimatized inoculum may also create an imbalance in the ratio of alcohol to acid, leading to the hypothesis that hydrolysis of protein-rich bio-waste coupled with CE could be a source of n-heptanoate and other odd-carbon-number carboxylates."
