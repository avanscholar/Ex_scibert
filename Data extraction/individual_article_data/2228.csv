0,Introduction,"Lignin is the second abundant component (just second to cellulose) in biomass and on the earth there is about 50 billion tons of lignin produced every year via photosynthesis [1]. Surely, lignin or biomass rich in lignin fall within important biomass resources, and its utilization has thus aroused great research interests inspired by the gradual depletion of fossil resources as well as the increasing environmental pollution caused by overuse of fossil resources. Above all, lignin is the only renewable source of aromatic chemicals, which structures consisting of such three single-ring phenyl-propane units as coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, and coumaryl alcohol [2], and has thus an exclusively charming prospective for massive production of phenolics. Compared to recovering high heating value biofuels (originating from the low oxygen contents in the structure of lignin) from lignin or biomass rich in lignin via various methods (first of all, the thermo-chemical conversion [3–6]), highly selective conversion of lignin and lignin wastes for producing aromatic chemicals are supposed to gain greater benefits in both economy and environment. Lots of studies have been conducted to convert lignin into chemicals or biofuels by thermal pyrolysis or pyrolysis in various solvents (solvothermal methods), and diverse catalysts such as HZSM-5, zeolite NaY and activated char were also used for its selectively catalytic conversion to gain the desired chemicals or high-quality fuels [7,8]. Among these thermo-chemical methods, the hydrothermal technology has recently attracted increasing attention as a promising one to produce value added phenolic chemicals, in light of its many exceptional merits. Specifically, hydrothermal technology employs hot compressed water without secondary pollution as the solvent and the reactant, which has high acidity/alkalinity at the same time to facilitate many organic reactions in addition to its small dielectric constants favoring dispersion of reactants and products [9,10]. More primarily, the evaporation of water is avoided to significantly reduce the heat required for conventional pyrolysis of biomass (lignin) frequently possessing high water contents. Hydrothermal conversion of lignin can break up its macromolecular structures but maintain the essential aromatic units in them to fairly big extents to attain large amounts of aromatic aldehydes and phenolics [9]. Hydrothermal degradation of lignin has been performed at sub-critical or super-critical conditions (for pure water: T c = 374, P c = 22.1 MPa) to improve the phenolics formation [11–13]. For example, Cheng et al [13] converted alkali lignin into bio-phenolics in water-ethanol solvent and obtained as a high lignin decomposition ratio as 89 %. When lignin was degraded in super-critical water the main products were recognized to be catechol (28.37 wt%), phenol (7.53 wt%) and cresol (11.67 wt%) [10]. By conducting degradation of lignin with water as reaction medium with formic acid as the hydrogen source in combination with a palladium catalyst and a solid acid catalyst (Nafion® SAC-13), Liguori et al [6] achieved the highest yields of 6.3 wt%, 5.7 wt% and 5.6 wt% for 2-methoxy-phenol, pyrocatechol and resorcinol, respectively. According to Besse et al [14], eugenol - one of lignin model compounds could be hydrogenated to 2-methoxy-4-propyl-phenol over a Pt/C catalyst in a water/ethanol mixture in the absence of H2. All in all, hydrothermal conversion of lignin has exhibited good selectivities to such phenolics as phenol, cresol and catechol, which are all important intermediates in chemical industry for synthesis pesticide, photographic materials, perfumes and phenolic resins [9,15,16] and so on. Actually, Kelly et al [15] did successfully synthesize phenol formaldehyde (PF) resins by using the phenols extracted from a bio-oil, and found that the performance properties of the synthesized PF resins were better than commercial PF resins when 25 wt% monomeric phenol was replaced with extracted ones. Nevertheless, due to lack of practical technologies, large-scale utilization of lignin lags behind that of cellulose - the most major component in biomass. This thus leads to increasing quantities of lignin co-products usually treated as biomass wastes and even environmental pollutants. E. g., black liquor (BL) produced (after extracting cellulose from lignocellulosic biomass) in pulp and paper industry usually contains large amounts of lignin, which are undoubtedly one kind of bulky lignin resource but frequently lead to environmental pollution. Annually, about 240 million tons of BL is produced worldwide [17]. At present, these “biomass wastes” rich in lignin are mainly utilized for the purpose to produce electricity, heat and biofuels besides occasional recovery for producing some low-value bio-products (e.g., binding and dispersing agents) [18,19]. If such large amounts of lignin can be converted to value-added phenolics, this will surely generated bigger profits. Though there were some studies on hydrothermal conversion of lignin, a systematic investigation on the conversion of lignin into monophenols is still lacking [20,21]. This study is devoted to hydrothermal degradation of lignin in sub-critical water with addition of alkalis or/and hydrogen donors, to realize the high selectivity of lignin to monophenolics. By this way, it is possible to develop cascade utilization of BL, that is, first production of aromatic chemicals via hydrothermal technology and then energy recovery from the produced organic residue via combustion, gasification or like. Alkalis and hydrogen donors were employed based on their positive effects on improving lignin decomposition and monomer generation [6,21–23]. New insights into the effects of alkalis and hydrogen donors are undoubtedly instructive for recovery of phenolic chemicals from BL, because alkalis are frequently left in BL from widely employed alkaline pulping processes [24] and hydrogen donors (for example, such small molecular organic acids as formic and acetic acids) can be produced during (hydro-)thermal degradation [25]. Taking into consideration that higher temperature water with higher saturated vapor pressure has to require higher pressure-bearing reactors with higher cost, the moderate temperate of 300 °C, which yet enabled good performance for biomass conversion according to Liguori and Barth [6], was thus chosen as the reaction temperature. Additionally, based on the observation by Zhang et al [26] that the liquid yield drastically increased with raising heating rate increased when conducting hydrothermal liquefaction of lignin, in this research all hydrothermal degradation experiments with lignin underwent rapid heating (by employing micro-tube reactors and preheated salt bath)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The tested raw materials were a commercial alkali lignin and an industrial BL. The alkali lignin was purchased from Tokyo chemical industry Co., Ltd and was a dealkalized lignin (99.99%). The BL, which was provided by China National Pulp and Paper Research Institute, was from a process for alkaline pulping of wheat straw (harvested after full maturity from the wheat planted in North China) and had a pH value of 11 or so and a solid content of about 11.5 wt%. The BL samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C until tested. The alkali lignin and the BL were both used in our previous work, and in this work the same material pretreatment method for the BL was employed as in our previous articles to prepare the BL solid samples [1,24]. All the alkalis (NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3 and K2CO3) and hydrogen donors (formic acid, formate and acetate) used in this research were analytical reagents with purities of above 99.9%. The reagents for HPLC analyses of the liquid products were guaranteed reagents."
3,Hydrothermal degradation experiments,"2.2 Hydrothermal degradation experiments All hydrothermal experiments were carried out using several 6 mL micro-reactors (SS316L). Each micro-reactor was sealed with nut at one end, while another end of the reactor was connected with a valve through which the product gas could be collected. For performing a hydrothermal experiment, a micro-reactor was charged with 200 mg dried sample (lignin or BL solid) and 4.0 mL water as the solvent, and if necessary certain amounts of one alkali or/and one hydrogen donor. Subsequently, the reactor was sealed after enough N2 was purged into the reactor to replace the air in it. Then, the sealed reactor was subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 10 min to ensure good blend of the materials. For the hydrothermal reaction, the micro-reactor was put into a salt bath preheated to 300 °C. Assisted by shaking the micro-reactor, the desired reaction temperature of 300 °C was attained rapidly within 1–2 min, spontaneously generating a saturated vapor pressure of about 8.5 Mpa (corresponding to 300 °C sub-critical water) in the reactor. After the reactor was kept for a desired time, it was cooled by submerging into a mixture of ice and water bath to quench the reaction. The gas product was collected by a syringe for its analysis. For the liquid product (usually containing solid products), it was collected by washing the reactor with methanol after its pH value was adjusted to 3, and was in turn subjected to centrifugation to separate the solid products from the liquid product (centrifugate). The centrifugate contained water, methanol and methanol-soluble compounds. Both methanol and water were subsequently removed by evaporation to attain the weight of methanol-soluble products (denoted as MS), while the weight for the methanol-insoluble residue (denoted as MIR) it was weighed by drying the solid products obtained after centrifugation. When alkalis or/and hydrogen donors were added, they and their derived products (e. g., carbonate formed via CO2 absorption of alkali) probably resided in both the MS and MIS fractions. Thus, the yields of the MS and MIR fractions were calculated as the percentages of their total organic carbons (TOCs) against the TOC of the raw lignin sample. For a specific chemical (i), its product yield (yieldi) was calculated as the ratio of its mass (mi ) to the total mass of the added lignin (mlignin ), according to the following equation: (1) Yiel d i wt % = m i m lignin × 100 % Though the produced water and gases were difficult to be determined, their yields (including the possible loss) were all below 5 wt%. For convenience, the yields of water, gas (and loss if any) were merged and denoted as the yield of “water + gas + loss”."
4,Analysis approach,"2.3 Analysis approach The gas products were analyzed using a micro GC (Agilent 3000A) for its molar composition [24]. The gas contents were usually so little that they could not be accurately quantified. In order to identify the compounds in the liquid, the products from duplicable tests were extracted from the aqueous phase with ethyl acetate (10 mL × 3) and the ethyl acetate was then removed via rotating evaporation under a reduced pressure. The extractive chemicals were measured using a GC–MS (Agilent 6890/5975C) with high-purity helium as the carrier gas. After filtration through a membrane with 0.45 μm porous diameter, the methanol-soluble liquid was analyzed to quantify the main chemicals using a HPLC of UV 1201 (Dalian Elite Analytical Instruments Co., Ltd) equipped with an UV–VIS detector. The analysis was performed at room temperature on the Sinochem ODS 5 μm column (250 mm × 4.6 mm). The mixture of methanol and water at a volume ratio of 50:50 was used as the mobile phase, and the flow rate was 0.5 mL·min−1. The detection wavelength was 275 nm. The contents of 2-methoxy-phenol, catechol, cresol, vanillin, acetovanillone and 4-methyl-2-methoxy-phenol were determined according to the external standard method. The pure chemicals of the above products with different concentrations were used to calibrate their standard curves. FTIR analyses of the raw lignin and the dried residue from lignin degradation were performed by a Bruker FTIR spectrophotometer (Tensor 27) using KBr pellet (containing 1 wt% sample). The scanning wave number ranged from 4000 to 400 cm−1."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Verification of analysis method for main products,"3.1 Verification of analysis method for main products The products from hydrothermal degradation of the lignin and the BL at 300 °C (all hydrothermal experiments were conducted at this temperature in this research, unless otherwise specified) for 120 min were firstly recognized by using GC–MS, and the results are given in Table 1 (The corresponding GC chromatograms are shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (c)). The major detectable products included phenol, 2-methoxy-phenol (guaiacol), catechol, cresols (2-methyl-phenol and 4-methyl-phenol), 4-methyl-2-methoxy-phenol, acetovanillone, vanillin and the like. By comparison, the presence of NaOH led to more remarkable amounts of phenolics free of methoxyl(s) than the case without NaOH present (refer to Table 1 and Fig. 1(b)). Noticeably, catechol took up the dominant proportion in the total peak area of the products for the latter. Different from lignin, BL generated relatively more phenol and cresols. Anyhow, since the solubility of products in ethyl acetate varied greatly, the extracted products and their relative proportions could not precisely account for the actual reactions as well as their reaction degrees. Thus, the major products had to be quantitatively analyzed by HPLC, especially considering that the column used for GC analysis could not bear water. Fortunately, as Table 2 shows (the corresponding HPLC chromatograms are shown in Fig. 2 ), the pure matters of all the objective chemicals (catechol, 2-methoxy-phenol, cresols, 4-methyl-2-methoxy-phenol, phenol, vanillin and acetovanillone) could be detected and well separated by HPLC, which justified employment of HPLC for their quantitative analyses. For HPLC analyses, the external standard method was used to determine their respective concentrations in the solutions obtained after hydrothermal processes."
7,Hydrothermal degradation of lignin,"3.2 Hydrothermal degradation of lignin Fig. 3 (a) and (b) respectively give the product distribution and the yields of the objective chemicals from hydrothermal degradation of lignin at various reaction times. As Fig. 3a shows, the yield of MIR was above 45 wt% until the reaction time of 60 min, indicating that 60 min was too short to sufficiently degrade lignin. At the reaction time of 120 min, the yield of the MIR decreased to about 42 wt% and meanwhile that of the MS reached 48 wt%. However, when the reaction time was further prolonged to 240 min the yield of MS and MIR visibly decreased and increased, respectively. This was due to polymerization of the intermediate products from lignin degradation. The volume of the produced gas from lignin degradation was invariably only several milliliters, the dominant compositions in the gases were always CO2 with its yield fluctuating between 1–7 wt%. The total yield of the products (including that of gases and water as well as possible loss) other than MS and MIS only slightly increased with prolonging the reaction time. As a result, 120 min was the most favorite for lignin degradation. It was worth to note that the MS had a higher yield of about 50 wt% for the reaction time of 10 min, but at such a short reaction time the generated MS was supposed to mainly consist of methanol-soluble large fragments rather than small molecular weight organic compounds. Based on the above result, all the subsequent hydrothermal degradation experiments with lignin/BL were set to last 120 min, unless otherwise specified. This optimized degradation degree of lignin (58 wt%) was basically consistent with those from other researches. E.g., Pińkowska et al. [12] conducted hydrothermal decomposition of lignin and found that the yield of MIR fell within 35–50 wt% at a proximate temperature (280 °C). Cheng et al [13] also that degraded lignin occupied about 50% when using high temperature (300 °C) pure water as the solvent. Undoubtedly, the degree to which lignin can be transformed is dependent on the structure of the raw material [27], which was accountable for the slight difference in the MS yield from different lignin sources. There must be some undetectable compounds in the MS. Even so, the total yield of the objective chemicals reached 8 wt% after hydrothermal degradation of lignin for 120 min, as shown in Fig. 3b. Among the major chemicals, 2-methoxy-phenol can be directly generated from the coniferyl alcohol units of lignin, and its yield first increased with prolonging the reaction time and peaked about 2.5 wt% at 120 min and then slightly decreased at longer reaction times. The decrease in the yield of 2-methoxy-phenol could be largely attributed to deepened demethoxylation of its ether structure. As a result, the yield of catechol steadily increased with increasing reaction time, achieving the highest value of about 5.5 wt% at the reaction time of 240 min. The conversion of 2-methoxy-phenol into catechol was also inferred by Pińkowska et al. [12]. Wahyudiono et al. [10,28] further testified that the main product of demethoxylation of 2-methoxy-phenol is right catechol. The trend of the continuing increase in the yield of catechol at 300 °C was also totally consistent with that observed for hydrothermal decomposition of lignin at 280 °C ([10,28], though the highest catechol yield (5.5 wt%) was higher for the former compared to that (4 wt%) for the latter due to the temperature being higher for the former than the latter. Additionally considering that for higher temperatures than 300 °C significant decreases in the yield of catechol appeared after 60 min [10,28], in this research the chosen temperature of 300 °C for lignin hydrothermal decomposition was proper, which boosted the production of the objective chemicals but meanwhile inhibited its polymerization to largest extents [10,28]. Anyhow, these change trends of the yields of 2-methoxy-phenol and catechol indicated that though 120 min was the most favorite for lignin degradation, a much longer reaction time was necessary for sufficient demethoxylation (here, of 2-methoxy-phenol) to generate phenolics free of methoxyl group(s) (here, catechol) at the employed temperature of 300 °C. From the FTIR spectra of lignin and the residue from lignin degradation in Fig. 4 , it can be seen that the absorption band at the wavenumber around 3430 cm−1 characterizing the OH stretching vibration and the peak at 2930 cm−1 representing the CH bond are weakened in the residue. This suggests that large amounts of branched chains were removed from lignin to generate micro-molecules after considering that there exist only such branched chains as C1 C3 aliphatic hydrocarbons and OCH3 attached to benzene rings in lignin structure. The peak intensity at 1720 cm−1 depicting the stretch vibration CO in ketones, carboxylic acids and aldehydes is also reduced obviously in the residue, implying that the hydrothermal degradation of lignin was in favor of decarbonylation [24]. The carboxylic groups in carboxylic acids are easy to be stripped off to form CO2, while decarbonylation of ketones and aldehydes tends to form CO [29,30]. Via the water-gas shift reaction (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2) strengthened by H2 (to be discussed hereinafter), CO was mostly transferred to generate CO2. These thus accorded with our above observation that CO2 was invariably the major composition of the produced gas products."
8,Lignin degradation with alkali addition for phenolics,"3.3 Lignin degradation with alkali addition for phenolics Alkalis have been verified to facilitate lignin degradation and improve the formation of phenolics [5,21]. In this research, different alkalis with different addition amounts were tested to compare their effects. First of all, hydrothermal degradation of lignin at different mass ratios of NaOH to lignin (Na/L) was performed to determine the optimal addition amount of alkali and Fig. 5 gives the yields of the main chemicals. Obviously, in comparison with the case without addition of NaOH, the total yield of the objective chemicals was enhanced and the formation of all the major detected phenolics (above all, catechol) except 2-methoxy-phenol were promoted by addition of NaOH, regardless of the Na/L ratio. When the Na/L ratio increased to 0.25, the yield of the objective chemicals reached the highest value of about 12 wt% with the yield of catechol peaking 8 wt%. Though the addition of NaOH (he Na/L ratio no more than 0.25) increased the yield of catechol from 4 wt% to 5.5–8 wt%, more NaOH did not facilitate catechol formation any more. It must be pointed that the visibly lower catechol yield appearing at the highest Na/L mass ratio of 1.0 was probably caused by the operation errors (this high concentration of alkali resulted in the obtained solutions being very viscous and thus difficulty in separating MS from MIS fractions in the solution). Different alkalis were verified to exhibit discrepant effects on pyrolysis of lignin [1,21,31]. Here, three other alkalis (KOH, Na2CO3 and K2CO3) with the same moles as that (0.00125 mol) of the above NaOH additive were also tested to investigate the difference of their impacts on improving hydrothermal degradation of lignin. As shown in Table 3 , all the employed alkalis significantly promoted catechol formation and the yield of catechol ranged between 7.4 and 8.4 wt%. The weak alkalis (Na2CO3 and K2CO3) slightly facilitated 2-methoxy-phenol generation, while the strong alkalis (NaOH and KOH) more visibly boosted phenol and cresols formations. These results were similar with those obtained from lignin pyrolysis [1], i.e., all the alkalis promoted decarboxylation and demethoxylation of intermediate products (to form catechol), and the strong alkalis (hydroxides) additionally exhibited the effect of deoxygenation (to generate phenol and cresols). In addition, it could also be concluded from the data in Table 3 that there was no significant difference between the sodium and potassium cations irrespective of basic radicals (here, OH− or CO 3 2 - ). The confirmatory experiments with 2-methoxy-phenol degradation in 300 °C sub-critical water were also carried here, and the results were given in Table 4 (HPLC chromatograms for the products are given in Fig. 6 ). Clearly, 2-methoxy-phenol could be significantly transformed to catechol (21.7 wt%) followed by cresol (6.3 wt%). Just as mentioned above, demethoxylation could well account for the formation of catechol, while the formation of cresol had to be apparently attributed to deoxygenation of 2-methoxy-phenol. It was worth to be noted that in essence deoxygenation of 2-methoxy-phenol was probably via isomerization of methoxyl group to hydroxymethyl group followed by dehydration. With the presence of NaOH, the conversion of 2-methoxy-phenol was strengthened, and correspondingly the yields of catechol and cresol respectively increased to 51.4 wt% and 12.5 wt% (again refer to Table 4). This conformed that strong bases strengthened demethoxylation and meanwhile promoted deoxygenation of 2-methoxy-phenol to thus facilitate the formation of catechol and cresol. Gathering up the above threads, lignin in sub-critical water would depolymerize into monomer units mainly consisting of substituted phenolics (e. g., 2-methoxy-phenol and vanillin), and then these monomers were apt to undergo demethoxylation/decarbonylation and further deoxygenation (especially with the aid of alkalis) to form simple phenolics with catechol and cresols topping the yield. Actually, decarbonylation generated CO, to boost succedent deoxygenation by formation of hydrogen via water-gas shift reaction. As such, CO was consumed and CO2 were left. This is just the main reason for the fact that CO2 invariably occupied the dominant proportions in the gas products. These pathways for the above-mentioned hydrothermal conversion of lignin into various phenolic products are summarized in Fig. 7 ."
9,Lignin degradation with hydrogen donor addition for phenolics,"3.4 Lignin degradation with hydrogen donor addition for phenolics As well known, formic acid and formates can provide hydrogen rich environment enabling deep degradation of biomass during its pyrolysis and thus improve the yields of small molecular organic matters, especially those with low oxygen content via in situ hydrodeoxygenation [23]. To obtain phenolics with high yields from hydrothermal conversion of lignin, formic acid and calcium formate were employed and the results are given in Fig. 8 . After the two hydrogen donors were added in 300 °C sub-critical water respectively, almost all the yields of the objective chemicals were, as expected, enhanced. The highest total yield of the objective chemicals reached 18 wt% and 13 wt% for 0.1 g formic acid and 0.05–0.1 g calcium formate, respectively. For this reason, formic acid exhibited more positive effects on phenolics production than calcium formate did. For formic acid, the yields of the objective chemicals basically followed the order of catechol > 2-methoxy-phenol > 4-methyl-2-methoxy-phenol > cresols > phenol > acetovanillone > vanillin. This order for the yields of these objective chemicals was also suitable for calcium formate except that the yields of 4-methyl-2-methoxy-phenol and cresols increased and decreased with increasing addition amount of calcium formate, respectively, with them intersecting at an addition amount between 0.05 and 0.1 g. For both the two hydrogen donors (≥0.05 g), the yield of catechol was invariably above 5.0 wt%. However, with respect to 2-methoxy-phenol, its yield was always above 4.0 wt% for formic acid but kept constant at about 2.7 wt% for calcium formate. Noteworthily, the yield of 2-methoxy-phenol evidently decreased with increasing addition amount (≥0.05 g) of formic acid but leveled off with increasing addition amount of calcium formate. This was supposed to result from phenol-formaldehyde condensation of 2-methoxy-phenol (to generate 4-hydroxyl-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde) at the presence of sufficient amounts of formic acid. The condensation reaction could in turn be responsible for the gradually increasing yield of 4-methyl-2-methoxy-phenol (for example, via hydrodeoxygenation of 4-hydroxyl-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde) for both the hydrogen donors. Relatively, formates (here calcium formate) were more thermally stable to generate less free hydrogen for hydrogenation of intermediate products from lignin degradation, which resulted in lower total chemical yields compared to those at the presence of formic acid, just as mentioned above. This could also explain that the yield of cresol increased with increasing amount of formic acid but decreased with increasing amount of formic calcium, considering that formic acid could provide more free hydrogen to facilitate deoxygenation of methoxyl group(s) (for example, of 2-methoxy-phenol). Though formic acid relatively better boosted phenolics production than formate, it was still necessary to reveal the potentials of different organic salts for phenolics production, since non-neglectable quantities of inherent alkali frequently exist in lignin-rich wastes such as BL (e. g., from alkaline pulping). Small amounts of organic acid present in BL have to first neutralize certain amounts of alkali to generate organic salts, leaving part of alkali. Taking these into consideration, hydrothermal degradation of lignin with simultaneous presence of NaOH and several organic salts including sodium formate, sodium acetate, calcium formate and calcium acetate were performed, and Fig. 9 gives the yields of the objective chemicals. Apparently, all the four hydrogen donors had the positive effects on lignin degradation and phenolics production. With NaOH simultaneous present, the highest total yields of the objective chemicals were about 22 wt%, 20 wt%, 15 wt% and 15 wt% for additions of sodium formate, sodium acetate, calcium formate and calcium acetate, respectively. These manifested more or less increases after comparing the above highest total yields with 12 wt% for the presence of only NaOH and 13 wt% for calcium formate added alone. The most main chemicals were catechol and cresols, and their total yield peaked 18 wt%, 16 wt%, 12 wt% and 12 wt% for sodium formate, sodium acetate, calcium formate and calcium acetate, respectively. The superficial effects of the hydrogen donors followed the order of sodium formate > sodium acetate > calcium formate ≈ calcium acetate. Considering the different moles of anions and cations of these organic salts (see Table 5 ), the visible reductions in the highest total yield of the objective chemicals did not seem to mainly result from the difference between formate and acetate anions but were likely to be caused by the difference between sodium and calcium cations. Above all, for the two sodium salts the highest total yield of catechol and cresols was almost in direct proportion to the molar amounts of organic acid anions (again refer to Table 5), probably implying that at the same molar ratios the effect of formate and acetate anions were virtually close on facilitating lignin degradation and the production of the two most major phenolic chemicals. However, for the two calcium salts, the highest total yield of catechol and cresols was identical though the mole of the acetate anion in calcium acetate was less than that of the formate anion in calcium formate. Presumably, this was due to their low solubilities. On the whole, compared to the two calcium salts the two sodium salts seemed to have better potentials to provide more active hydrogen so that the yields of the objective chemicals were higher. After addition of sodium formate the highest total yields of the objective chemicals reached up to 22 wt%, and correspondingly the yields of catechol and cresols peaked at about 16 wt% and 3.5 wt%, respectively. Obviously, the combination of alkalis and hydrogen donors further enhanced the selectivity to catechol, exhibiting a good prospective for hydrothermally converting lignin-rich bio-wastes containing alkali (e. g. BL) into phenolics (especially for catechol)."
10,Black liquor degradation for phenolics,"3.5 Black liquor degradation for phenolics Fig. 10 gives the results from hydrothermal conversion of BL without and with hydrogen donors present (the hydrogen donor/material mass ratios was fixed at 0.05 g/0.2 g for the presence of any hydrogen donors, the corresponding HPLC chromatograms for product analyses are given in Fig. 11 ). As anticipated, catechol occupied the biggest proportion in the objective chemicals, regardless of hydrogen donor addition. The rest of the major products included such other phenolics as cresols, phenol, 4-methyl-2-methoxy-phenol and 2-methoxy-phenol. Even without addition of any hydrogen donor, the total yield of the objective chemicals from BL approached 10 wt% with the yields of catechol and cresols reaching respectively about 4 and 2 wt%, compared to that (about 8 wt%) from lignin. These were supposed to originate from generation of formates and acetates from the thermal degradation of lignin itself, considering that the two organic salts are thermally stable [32] and provided that they could act as reactive hydrogen [23]. With additional addition of the two formates (sodium and calcium formates) the yields of catechol, cresols and phenol increased and the total yield of the objective chemicals reached 11 wt%. By contrast, both the two acetates (sodium and calcium acetates) seemed to inhibit the production of almost all the major phenolics to certain degrees, probably because acetate anion was, as mentioned above, inactive to generate free hydrogen to stabilize the fragments from BL degradation, and thus could not effectively hinder the condensation reactions between the intermediate products. Reasonably, certain amounts of active fragments/intermediate products had to be formed from cellulose and hemicellulose in the BL, accompanying the degradation of lignin. In summary, thermal degradation of BL for phenolics could not be boosted by inactive acetates but by active formates. Anyhow, with any hydrogen donor present, the total yield of the objective chemicals was basically lower from BL degradation than from lignin degradation. In addition to polymerization of more active fragments formed from non-lignin compositions in BL, this was partially attributed to some undetected chemicals. After all, as shown in Table 1, the detectable products from BL degradation were more diversified than those from lignin degradation, supposedly due to the compositions and structures of BL being more complicated than those of pure lignin. The residues obtained after hydrothermal degradation of BL were analyzed, and the data indicated that the high heating values of the residues were all above 7000 kJ/kg. Therefore, they could be combusted to recover energy and alkalis required for alkaline pulping. This indeed implied the feasibility of cascade utilization of the BL. In other words, BL can be first subjected to hydrothermal conversion to obtain phenolics (mainly catechol, cresols and phenol) with high selectivities and the residue is in turn combusted to recover energy and alkalis."
11,Conclusions,"Alkalis facilitated hydrothermal degradation of lignin and thus boosted phenolics production by decarbonylation and demethoxylation, and the strong alkalis exhibited additional deoxygenation effects to generate phenolics free of methoxyl group(s). Compared to alkalis, hydrogen donors more visibly favored phenolics production but with less selectivities. Combination of strong alkalis and hydrogen donors generated synergistically positive effects on producing phenolics at high total yields (22 wt%) and with high selectivities (especially to phenolics free of methoxyl group(s) such as catechol and cresols). The effects of organic salts (here formates and acetates) on boosting lignin degradation and phenolics production were not significantly correlated with their acid radical anions but heavily lied on their solubilities. Via hydrothermal conversion, BL could produce phenolics at high yields of 10 wt% or higher (above all catechol and cresols took up more than 60%) with the aid of its inherent alkali and its self-generated hydrogen donors, which showed a promising prospective for its cascade utilization."
