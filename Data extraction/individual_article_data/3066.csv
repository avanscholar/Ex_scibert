0,Introduction,"Catalytic hydrogenation (CH) is one of the most useful and important catalytic methods used in synthetic organic chemistry. It has been largely studied in both laboratory and large-scale production [1,2]. The CH process technology is well established and the laboratorial experiment scale up presents low difficulty levels. In most cases, extreme conditions (high pressure and temperature) are necessary to accelerate the process, leading to by-products and a significant increase of the operating costs [1,3,4]. The main reason for the increase in operating costs is related to the production and storage of the molecular hydrogen, since it is mostly produced from fossil fuels. It is estimated that 49% of the hydrogen production comes from natural gas sources, and only 4% is resulting from electrolysis processes [5]. Otherwise, the electrochemistry is a clean technology that allows in situ hydrogen generation for the CH process; this technique will henceforth be referred to as electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH). The ECH provides an alternative synthetic route for the hydrogenation of some organic molecules under mild conditions (room temperature and normal pressure) and is considered an attractive process because it dispenses a molecular hydrogen supply, since atomic hydrogen is produced on the electrode surface and also eliminates inconveniences such as catalyst poisoning [6–9] The main difference between the CH and ECH processes concerns the generation of chemisorbed hydrogen. Hydrogen is a clean and environmentally friendly energy carrier that can be produced by means of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during water electrolysis. According to classical theory [10], overall HER on the metal (M) surface may proceed via elementary steps. At the first step, the catalyst surface undergoes a primary discharge (Eq. (1)) in which the reduction of hydronium ions form atomic chemisorbed hydrogen (MHads). This discharge step is believed to be fast and followed by both desorption and/or recombination steps (Eqs. (2) and (3)). (1) H3O+ + e− + M → MHads + H2O (Volmer reaction) (2) 2MHads → M + H2 (Tafel reaction) (3) H3O+ + MHads + e− → M + H2 + H2O (Heyrovsky reaction) Either reaction, Heyrovsky or Tafel, is considered to be a rate-limiting step. Thus, the HER mechanism may be represented as Volmer–Heyrovsky or Volmer–Tafel [10]. In the ECH process, the chemisorbed hydrogen (MHads) reacts with unsaturated organic molecules (Y = Z) (Eqs. (4) and (5)) adsorbed on the catalyst (cathode) surface, followed by desorption of the hydrogenated product (Eq. (6)) and regeneration of the adsorption sites [11–14]. (4) Y = Z + M → M(Y = Z)ads (5) 2MHads + M(Y = Z)ads → M(YH-ZH)ads (6) M(YH-ZH)ads → M + YH-ZH The electrocatalysis is a procedure exploring the rates of electrochemical reactions as a function of the electrode surface properties. Thus, a metal is considered catalytically active if it is able to chemisorb both atomic hydrogen and unsaturated bonds of the substrate. The most important classes of metals with catalytic activity are those in Groups 8–11 of the Periodic Table, i.e. Fe, Co, Ni and Cu groups. The choice of cathode material is a difficult task and is generally governed by economic factors. In the last decades, extensive studies have been carried out on this subject, looking for efficient, robust, and low-cost catalysts for the ECH [6,13,14,15–22], which could potentially replace the widely used Pd and Pt electrocatalysts. Nickel is among the most abundant transition elements in the Earth’s crust and is, for instance, 100-fold and more than 130-fold cheaper than Ru and Pd, respectively [23]. This makes its use as catalyst for both ECH and HER extremely attractive. For example, Navarro et al. [11] investigated the development of an ECH system using undivided cells and Ni as the sacrificial anode (referred as to ECHSA), which permits a fine deposit of Ni during ECH process. In other work [24], the optimum conditions for the ECHSA of benzaldehyde in water, using β−cyclodextrin (βCD) as inverse phase transfer catalyst (IPTC) were determined. The morphology of the nickel deposited on the cathode matrix (Cu, Fe, Ni or Fe/Ni alloy (64:36)) during a pre-electrolysis was investigated. The results showed that the hydrogenation yields for the cathode matrices of Fe:Ni alloy, Fe, and Cu were the same, remaining within the experimental error. Substrates like olefins [25], arenes [26], aromatic and aliphatic nitriles [27], unsaturated aldehydes [28] and ketones [29] have been hydrogenated by the electrocatalytic process. However, the use of insoluble substrates leads to an overall yield drop of the ECH method, due to the mass-transport limitation between the bulk solution and the electrode surface. Consequently, the use of co-solvent is generally the only alternative wishing to hydrogenate highly hydrophobic substrates in water. However, the ECH field have a marked tendency for using different co-solvents making recycling difficult owing to cross contamination [9,11–14,16–19,22]. Although co-solvents might solve the mutual insolubility problem, they can also cause certain disadvantages such as competing hydrolysis pathways and difficulties in their purification and removal. The absence of the solvent should be the ideal situation, once it implies efforts and energy to remove it from the reactional system [30,31]. Therefore, a promising alternative to circumvent the aforementioned disadvantages is the use of ultrasound (US) in the ECH process. US has been recognised as a key technique for green and sustainable synthetic processes, allowing the use of non-active metals and crude reagents as well as aqueous media [32]. The sonoelectrochemistry is the science that couples US to electrochemistry and provide a powerful combination for the surface activation of materials toward HER [33,34]. The first application of US in an electrochemical procedure dates back to the 1930s, when Moriguchi [35] showed that under sonication, the water electrolysis (Pt electrode) took place at lower voltages and faster rates than under normal (silent) conditions. The many benefits of US in electrochemical process are well known. The particular advantages which accrue from the use of sonoelectrochemistry include: 1) the enhancement of the mass transport to/from an electrode and in bulk solution, which affects concentration-dependent phenomena; 2) the diminution of the diffusion layer, which affects electron transfer; 3) the modification of the electrode surface phenomena (adsorption/desorption), the diminution of the electrode fouling and removal of electrode coatings [28,30,31]. When US is applied to a liquid, several processes can occur that often create unusual physical conditions: acoustic streaming, turbulent convection, microstreaming in the presence of oscillating bubbles and cavitation [36,37]. The chemical and physical effects of US arise from a cavitation phenomenon, which produces localized extreme conditions (short-lived hot spots). Cavitation is the origin of sonochemical effects. The significance of cavitation to sonochemistry is not so much on how the bubbles form, but rather what happens when they collapse. Cavitation arises from the rapid compression and rarefaction phases of the longitudinal sound wave propagating throught the liquid. When cavitation occurs in a liquid close to a solid surface (e.g. a cathode matrix/electrode), the dynamics of the cavity collapse is rather asymmetric and produces high-speed jets of liquid, termed “microjets”. The impact of the jets on the surface is very strong causing damages and leading to cleaning, ablation and, sometimes, fracture of the structure, increasing the number of edges, crevices and kinks that expose fresh and highly active surfaces [37–40]. Ultrasound-enhanced electrochemical systems with different electrodes have been widely reported for oxidation of variety of organics such as chlorinated organics [41], dyes [42] and phenolic substances [43]. The US-assisted chemical reduction method has been successfully applied in the preparation of amorphous alloys with homogeneous particle sizes [44]. However, the number of articles in the field of ECH reporting the use of US is limited. For instance, US was used as a pre-electrolytic treatment in the ECH of benzaldehyde, in water using a Ni electrode, leading to an increase of 5% in the hydrogenation yields [24]. In this context, the present investigation explored the use of US in the ECH of α,β-unsaturated ketones and aldehydes in water using a simple undivided cell with a sacrificial anode (US-ECHSA). (R)-(+)-Pulegone ((+)-(1)) was adopted as the standard substrate. This study is relevant from both sonoelectrochemistry and green standpoint because, besides meeting the principles 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9 of sustainable and green chemistry [31], no study have yet been reported concerning the use of US to assist the ECHSA of (+)-(1) in water."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals (+)-(1) (96%) was purchase from Acros. Diethyl ether, ammonium chloride (supporting electrolyte), acid chloride, sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphate were purchased from Vetec. Acetylcyclohexene, 2-cyclohexen-1-one, isophorone, (S)-(+)-carvone, β- and α−ionone, 2-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one, mesityl oxide, chitosan, polyvinyl alcohol and glutaraldehyde were purchase from Aldrich and used as received. Water was of Milli-Q® grade."
3,Procedures,"2.2 Procedures 2.2.1 Electrochemical procedure The controlled current preparative electrolyses were carried out with an Autolab PGSTAT101 potentiostat/galvanostat, using a 30 mL undivided cell. A cylindrical nickel rod was used as sacrificial anode (0.1 dm diameter; 0.078 dm2 area). Another Ni bar (0.1 dm diameter; 0.078 dm2 area) was also used as the working electrode, which can be reused several times after removing the nickel deposit by abrasion and polishing processes. Water was the solvent in all electrochemical experiments. A Bandelin Sonopuls ultrasonic homogenizer HD 2070 was used for the approach of ultrasound-assisted electrolyses. The basic setup consists of a 30 mL undivided electrochemical cell (Fig. 1 ), which was filled with the 25 mL of 0.2 M of the supporting electrolyte and 0.5 mmol of substrate. The ultrasonic irradiation at a frequency of 20 kHz ± 500 Hz was used for passage of ultrasound into the reaction mixture through a titanium cylindrical horn, submerged 3.0 cm into reaction mixture. Ultrasonic horn had a diameter of 13 mm and maximum rated power output of 70 W. The probe was connected and isolated from the transducer by the introduction of a Teflon® disc. The transducer connected to the generator transforms the high-frequency power from the generator to ultrasound (continuous (7, 14 or 35 W) or pulse mode (0.2 s)), converting it to a form of mechanical energy. A thermocouple (0.7 °C of accuracy) was inserted into the cell to measure the inside temperature. The distance between both electrodes was 1.5 cm and their distance for the probe was 0.5 cm, respectively. The schematic representation of experimental set up has been shown in Fig. 1. The procedure followed for the US-ECHSA were carried out by using a constant current density of 350 mA dm−2 until consumption of the charge required for the complete hydrogenation of the CO or CC double bond, i.e. 2 F mol−1. The cell voltage varied between −1.71 V and −1.85 V. The influence of temperature control of the solution on the efficiency of the process was studied. For this purpose, an ice bath was used, in which the temperature was measured with a probe type digital thermometer. A Flir i7 infrared thermometer (2% accuracy, ε = 0.95 and thermal sensitivity of 0.1 °C) were used to check variations in bulk temperature profile of the system. After electrolysis, the water solution was extracted with diethyl ether, dried with Na2SO4 and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). Gas chromatogram/mass spectra were recorded with a Varian 3380 GC or Shimatzu GC/MS model GC17A, a 70 eV ion trap, fitted with a 30 m capillary DB5 (HP) column, using a 60–220 °C temperature range (10 °C min−1). Comparisons with authentic samples were performed by GC (acetylcyclohexene, 2-cyclohexen-1-one, α−ionone and mesityl oxide), in order to identify the hydrogenation products and reagents. Toluene (0.067 mmol) was used as an internal standard to quantify the products and reagents. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used for the morphologic analyses of the electrodeposited nickel particles on the cathode and was carried out with a SHIMADZU SS-550. 2.2.2 Synthesis of chitosan microspheres To prepare the chitosan beads, initially a 20 mL aliquot of the 4% chitosan solution (w/v in 0.1 M HCl) was mixed with 20 mL of the 4% PVA solution and the mixing until completely homogeneous. The solution obtained from Chitosan/PVA was dripped in 200 mL of a 4% NaOH solution under constant stirring. The Chitosan/PVA solution was slowly dripped onto the NaOH solution, causing the coagulation of the droplets and consequent formation of the polymer spheres. After dripping of the entire polymer mixture, the spheres formed were kept in the NaOH solution for 2 h to complete coagulation. Then, the spheres were taken out of alkaline solution and washed thoroughly with deionized water. The spheres were add to a 2.5% aqueous solution of glutaraldehyde and hold in that solution for 2 h. After that, the spheres were wash with deionized water and kept in a beaker with water for 2 h to remove uncrosslinked glutaraldehyde. Finally, the spheres were kept in an oven at 60 °C for a period of 48 h. For the characterization of the spheres obtained, as for their surface morphology, a SEM analyzes were performed, after metallization of the spheres with gold. For the feasibility study of the spheres obtained in the removal of Ni+2 ions from the residual solution of the hydrogenation process, 1 g of spheres were added to 10 mL of the aqueous hydrogenation residue and the mixture was kept under slow stirring for 24 h. After this time the supernatant solution was filtered. Finally, an aliquot of the original residue solution and an aliquot of the supernatant after adsorption assay were analyzed for Ni+2 concentration by Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) using the SHIMADZU equipment Rayny 720."
4,Results and discussion,
5,US-ECHSA of (+)-(1),"3.1 US-ECHSA of (+)-(1) 3.1.1 Continuous US mode The synthesis of a large number of fine chemicals, particularly in the field of flavor/fragrance chemistry and pharmaceuticals, involves the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl intermediates as a critical step [3]. The hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyls into saturated carbonyls is comparatively easy to achieve because the CC bond is usually both thermodynamically and kinetically favored over the hydrogenation of the CO bond by ca. 35 kJ mol−1 [45]. (+)-(1) is a monoterpene ketone containing an exocyclic double bond, present in the leaves and flowering tops of several members of the mint family Lamiaceae. The hydrogenation of ((+)-(1)), generally proceeds via Scheme 1 , giving (−)-menthone ((−)-(2)) and (+)-isomenthone ((+)-(3)), which in turn produces four diastereoisomeric alcohols: (+)-neomenthol ((+)-(4)), (−)-menthol ((−)-(5)), (+)-neoisomenthol ((+)-(6)) and (−)-isomenthol ((−)-(7)) [13]. In this work, (+)-(1) was hydrogenated using the US-ECHSA procedure. Regardless of the charge used and the power of US employed in the experiments, only (-)-(2) and (+)-(3) were produced (average ratio of 1.21, Table 1 entries 1–6). The main product in every experiment described in Table 1 (entries 1–6) was (−)-(2) (trans configuration of the methyl and isopropyl group, diequatorial conformation). On the other hand, (−)-(2) and (+)-(3) (cis configuration) are susceptible to epimerization, changing the configuration of the carbon atom neighboring the CO group and remaining in equilibrium. The production of (+)-(4), (−)-(5), (+)-(6) and (−)-(7) was barely existent, indicating that the US-ECHSA, at continuous mode, proceeds according to the path (a) of Scheme 2 . Concerning the stereochemistry of the hydrogenation of (+)-(1), the use of continuous US, in different powers, was not influenced when comparing the ratio of the products (−)-(2) and (+)-(3) (Table 1, entries 1–6) with those obtained by using mechanical stirring (Table 1, entry 7). In addition, the US-ECHSA of (+)-(1) showed a more efficient conversion rate, selectivity and current efficiency (c.e.) than both the uniquely electrochemical procedures with or without mechanical stirring (Table 1, entries 7 and 8, respectively). 3.1.2 Pulsed US mode US pulses of 0.20 s per second were applied aiming to compare the ECH results of this procedure with those obtained at US continuous mode. Slight differences were observed among the hydrogenation conversion rates, i.e., the effect caused by US continuous or pulsed modes are within the experimental error (Table 1, entries 1–6 and 10–15, respectively). Conversely to the results obtained with the continuous US irradiation mode, the use of US pulses seems to change the equilibrium between (−)-(2) and (+)-(3) (average ratio of 0.93, Table 1 entries 10–13). However, high US power (35 W) seems to restore the original equilibrium and product distribution of (−)-(2) and (+)-(3) (average ratio of 1.05, Table 1, entries 14 and 15). According to Cervený and Kukula [46], the distribution of the products depends on both the hydrogenation and the epimerization rates. The authors assert that if the hydrogenation rate is high, the epimerization equilibrium between (−)-(2) and (+)-(3) is stabilized fast enough, and the disorder in the distribution of products does not occur. Indeed, the use of high US pulse (Table 1, entries 14 and 15) leads to an increase of the bulk solution temperature (Fig. 2 ), and to a high probability of reaction of M(Y = Z)ads and M(H)ads, corroborating the previously cited affirmation. In turn, the lowering of the US power leads to lower solution temperature (Fig. 2), diminishing the hydrogenation rate (Table 1, entries 10–13, 16, 17). In this sense, the use of low US pulsed power can, in some way, promote a competition between the epimerization and the hydrogenation reaction and shift the equilibrium between (−)-(2) and (+)-(3). Therefore, it is clear that the sonication presents, under certain experimental conditions (Table 1), a small stereochemical effect, and its magnitude depends on both the US power and the mode. However, it is know that stereochemical effects are uncommon in sonochemistry and various hypotheses can be employed to explain this behavior [47]. Thus, a reasonable interpretation along this line is premature and is beyond the scope of this work. Lastly, it is apparent from Table 1 (entries 7–8 and 13–17) that the production of axial hydroxyl group, resulting in the production of (+)-(4) and (+)-(6), was preferred and depend on the reaction condition. The selective production of axial hydroxyl can be explained by the substrate adsorption on the catalyst surface. (−)-(2) and (+)-(3) get adsorbed on the catalyst surface by the chair conformation, i.e., from the less restrained equatorial carbonyl side [46]. Thus, the axial hydroxyl group is produced indicating that the US-ECHSA of (+)-(1), at pulsed mode, proceeds according to the paths (b–d) of Scheme 2 ."
6,The effect of the US power on the ECHSA process,"3.2 The effect of the US power on the ECHSA process Since ECH occurs on a solid/liquid (electrode/electrolytic solution) interface, various effects, as previously mentioned, should be induced by the electrolytic solution sonication. The induction of convective movement of species in the reaction medium is the main effect of the acoustic streaming, resulting in the decrease of the thickness of the diffusion boundary layer, enhancing the mass transfer of electroactive species to the electrode surface, thus, accelerating the diffusion-controlled reactions [48,49]. When US is applied to an electrochemical system, parameters such as frequency (Hz), intensity (W cm−2), power (W), the source of ultrasound release and the temperature should be considered. The strength of acoustic streaming is directly proportional to the ultrasonic power intensity and inversely proportional to the bulk viscosity of the electrolyte [50]. Indeed, when applying the US power of 7 W in the ECHSA reactions, it was observed an average increase of 63.5% on the product yields, (Table 1, entries 1–2), if compared to the mechanical stirring reaction (Table 1, entry 7) and 74.5% when compared to the without stirring process (Table 1, entry 8). Doubling the US power (14 W) led to a slight average increase of 4.5% yield, (Table 1, entries 3–4) if compared to those obtained with US power of 7 W (Table 1, entries 1–2). The use of a 5-fold higher US power (35 W) did not change the hydrogenation yields (Table 1, entries 5–6), showing that the US-ECHSA reaction seems to reached a plateau. In fact, the ultrasonic energy that a system can take is limited. When a large amount of US power enters a system, a large amount of cavitation bubbles are accumulated around the ultrasonic probe. In these cases, the bubbles attenuate the sound waves, hindering the transport of acoustic energy (absorption) and the heat evolution occurs through the medium [38]. Furthemore, temperature is a factor that can influence conversion rate, selectivity, c.e. and catalyst life time. As shown in Fig. 3 , the higher the US power the higher the temperature of the solution. It is well know that faster diffusion rates occur at high temperatures. In fact, the increase of the bulk solution temperature corresponds to a higher probability of reaction of the adsorbed species, M(Y = Z)ads and M(H)ads, which could justify the hydrogenation yields observed in Table 1 (entries 1–6). However, the rate of the electrochemical desorption is not significantly affected by the temperature [51]. Therefore, at temperatures higher than the optimum temperature (Fig. 3) the amount of adsorbed species becomes stable and no significant changes are observed in the product yields."
7,The influence of the US on the current efficiency of the ECHSA process,"3.3 The influence of the US on the current efficiency of the ECHSA process The c.e. of the ECH is directly proportional to the ratio of the catalytic hydrogenation rate (Eqs. (4)–(6)) over the H2 generation rate (Eqs. (2) and (3)) [16,51], which can be used to measure the efficiency of the ECH process. The ratio hydrogenation/H2 generation can be affected by parameters like temperature and US power. The sonication provides an increase in the c.e. for a variety of electrosyntheses. For the electroreduction of p-methylbenzaldehyde, Nokata et al. [52] reported that the c.e. was increased in 54% under sonication when comparing to the absence of stirring solution, using only 0.5 F mol−1 of charge and ultrasonic power of 12 W. The maximum hydrogenation/H2 generation ratio, i.e., the maximum c.e. should correspond to a complete saturation of both organic substrate adsorption sites and Hads sites [24,51]. The ratio is also affected by factors which influence the coverage of the electrode by M(H)ads and the activity of M(H)ads. As shown in Table 1 (entries 2, 4, 6, 11, 13, 15–17), after consumption of 2 F mol−1, regardless the US mode, power and control of temperature used, the c.e. of the US-ECHSA process were reproducible and higher than 79%. At this condition, the chemisorbed hydrogens (M(H)ads) generated by electrochemical route reacts with the substrate M(Y = Z)ads, consequently there was a slight formation of H2 (Eqs. (2) and (3)), and both the atomic hydrogen formation and the diffusion of (+)-(1) to the electrode surface (Eqs. (1) and (4)) becomes more important. Surprisingly, after consumption of 1 Fmol−1, i.e., one mole of electron per mole of substrate, half of the required charge for complete hydrogenation of the CC bond, the c.e. of all reactions, regardless the US mode, power and control of temperature used, is dramatically increased (Table 1, entries 1, 3, 5, 10, 12 and 14). This paradoxical effect can be explained by the formation of H radical, generated by US irradiation, in the medium. It is known that the high temperature and pressure created within a collapsing cavitation bubble produced by US irradiation cause the formation of H and OH radicals through the break of the HO bond of the water. The detection of some intermediates has been difficult, and the unequivocal confirmation of the US-generated H radicals could only be obtained by electrochemical methods in recent decades [53]. For instance, Liang, Sheng and Han [54] reported a novel method for the preparation of water-soluble and small-size CdSe quantum dots under high-intensity ultrasonic irradiation. The authors proposed a possible mechanism for the formation of CdSe quantum dots in which the H radical is capable to reduce the SeSO3 2− specie to Se2−, leading to the formation of above mentioned quantum dot. Hence, in the present work, the bubbles formed by cavitation may be trapped at certain fixed pores locations by the effects of acoustic radiation force. As previously discussed, due to US action and cavitation processes, the catalytic surface stands more accessible to the substrate, increasing the probability of the catalyst coverage by adsorbed H radical generated by both US irradiation and electrochemical process. Notice that the application of 14 W of US, in the absence of electric current (Table 1, entry 9) does not form hydrogenation products. Therefore, additionally to the results described in Table 1, entries 7 and 8, it is noteworthy that the use of US, in detriment of the electric current, was not capable to carry out the hydrogenation of (+)-(1). Hence, a more pausible explanation for these results would be a synergism between the US irradiation and the ECHSA process, in which H radicals are produced from the sonication process, improving the coverage of the catalyst pores with M(H)ads (in addition to the electrochemical process), thus explaining the high c.e. values observed."
8,The influence of the temperature control on the US-ECHSA process,"3.4 The influence of the temperature control on the US-ECHSA process The temperature control plays an important role in the US process. If the temperature is not controlled, effects like degradation of the compounds of interest, volatilization of analytes [55] can occur. The temperature control is a difficult task. However, three strategies can be adopted to avoid the above mentioned effects. The first one is the use of ice or thermostatic bath that can be applied for a short sonication time. In the second one, the ultrasonic irradiation is intermittently interrupted (pulse mode), at this mode the amplifier switch turns “on” and “off” repeatedly, thus avoiding the buildup of the reaction temperature [56]. In a third one, the two strategies can be combined. As can be noticed in Fig. 4 , the use of ice bath decrease the temperature of the system for both continuous (61.2±0.7ºC to 23.9 ± 0.7ºC) and pulsed mode (41.3±0.7ºC to 13.7±0.7ºC). These behaviors can be more accurately viewed through the thermograms A–B and C–D, respectively, which show the temperature profiles of the systems by using ice bath system. Since the bath ensures a rapid dissipation of heating, the bulk temperature of the solution is colder than those without temperature control. The influence of the temperature control is more pronounced in the pulsed mode than the continuous mode (Table 1, entries 16 and 17, respectively). Indeed, at lower temperatures, the adsorbed species (Eqs. (1) and (4)) are less mobile and the probability of the reactions is lower, hence lower is the hydrogenation yield. On the other hand, without temperature control, the efficiency of the continuous mode (Table 1, entry 4) is not changed, being the conversion rate, c.e. and selectivity within the experimental error, when compared to the pulse mode (Table 1, entry 13). In this context, it is known that the continuous application of US during catalysis is claimed to give improvements in mass transport, and consequently in the product yields. Hence, the continuous application of US (14 W) without temperature control, is the most effective technique if compared with pulses of 0.2 s applied after each second, regardless the temperature control employed."
9,US effects on the cathode morphology,"3.5 US effects on the cathode morphology Cavitation erosion is predominantly mechanical in nature and has two possible sources: the shock wave of isolated imploding cavities attached to the surface and the jet impact with velocities estimated to be as high as 100 m s−l, which are generated by clusters of cavities collapsing near the surface [34,57]. The most popular theory is that erosion of metals results from asymmetric collapse of single bubbles attached to, or very close to the surface, which produces shock waves and liquid jets of sufficient force to deform the surface increasing the number of edges, crevices and kinks that expose fresh and highly active surfaces [40,57,58]. The synergetic effect of a metal deposited on a matrix has been studied, and the behavior of a deposit is different from a pure solid material [12–14,17,24]. Undoubtedly, the surface composition and morphology of the electrocatalyst plays a major role in the electrochemical performance towards the ECH process. As already pointed out, sonochemical approach is a versatile method of modification of metallic surfaces. Thus, regarding the morphology, the pre-sonication of the catalyst surface is as effective as a continuous sonication. Our group [24] has investigated the effects of US on particle morphology and catalyst reactivity, where the electrode irradiation in US bath changes the surface morphology (shape, spacing, homogeneity and size of the particles) of the Ni catalyst, enhancing the hydrogenation yields of 5%. In this procedure, the wall of the electrochemical cell difficult the propagation of the US irradiation, and the amount of energy that reaches the reaction in an US bath system, is low, ca. 5 W cm−2. Despite this, a smoothing effect was observe on the nickel surface. Conversely, ultrasonic probes delivers their energy directly into the system, thereby providing more efficient cavitation in the liquid and enhancing the US effects on the catalyst surface, as can be seen from the following SEM analyses. In this work, a nickel sacrificial anode was used in an undivided cell with the aim to provide a constant renewal of the catalyst surface. This procedure was used in electro-reductive systems to avoid side oxidation reactions on the anode [59], during the ECH process [12–14,24,60]. In general, the results in Table 1 point to the edges and/or corners (small particles) favoring hydrogenation of the CC bond (selectivity of 98% on average, entries 1–6 and 9–16) whereas the planes (large particles) favor hydrogenation of the CO bond given saturated alcohols (selectivity of 21.5%, on average, entries 7 and 8). This seems to be true when we analyze the SEM of the cathode surface (Fig. 5 A). The structure of a naked nickel cluster differs from a Ni surface irradiated by continuous US (Fig. 5B–D). The SEM of the Ni surface electrochemically deposited on Ni matrix during US irradiation, revealed that the surfaces are smoothed, and the particles are uniformly distributed and consolidated into extended aggregates (Fig. 5B–D). The clusters of electrodeposited nickel are smaller on the matrix treated by US and reveal the pitting of the Ni surface, which acts to expose a new surface to the substrate and increases the effective surface area available for US-ECHSA reaction leading to high efficiency in the hydrogenation process (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). The particle size decreasing was a result of the cavitation energy generated by US. Conversely, the SEM of Ni deposit on the Ni cathode matrix, treated under silent condition (Fig. 5E and F), revealed bigger particles than those formed under US treatment, which justify the low efficiency of the silent process as mentioned earlier (Table 1, entry 7)."
10,Application of chitosan microspheres in the removal of nickel ions of the aqueous medium,"3.6 Application of chitosan microspheres in the removal of nickel ions of the aqueous medium The use of a nickel sacrificial anode in an undivided cell provide a simple electrochemical system for hydrogenation of several organic compounds with high durability of the catalyst due the constant renewal of the electrode coating (Eq. (7)). Despite the advantages and results discussed throughout this work, the use of a nickel sacrificial anode brings an inconvenience from the point of view of the environment, since nickel ions are generate in solution (Eq. (8)). (7) Ni2+ +2e− → Ni(M) (8) Ni → Ni2+ + 2e− Accordingly to the first of the twelve principles of green chemistry: it is better to prevent waste than to treat or clean up waste after it has been created. However, there is no way to prevent the generation of nickel ions by using the sacrificial anode with undivided cell technique. Nevertheless, an interesting alternative to circumvent this disadvantage is the use of chitosan as an adsorbent matrix to removal heavy metals of solution [61–63]. In this sense, and aiming the remediation of the residue, chitosan/polyvinyl alcohol (Chitosan/PVA) composite spheres were prepared and applied as an adsorbent for the removal of Ni2+ ions from the aqueous solution. Fig. 6 shows the micrograph of a Chitosan/PVA sphere produced. It can be observed that the microsphere is homogeneous and have a diameter of approximately 1 mm. Also in Fig. 6, the macroscopic appearance of the beads before and after exposure to the nickel-containing residual solution can be observed. After adsorption, it is noteworthy that the blue color of the spheres and the colorless supernatant solution are evidences of the nickel residue extraction generated during the US-ECHSA process. The EDXRF analysis showed that the concentration of Ni2+ ions in the original solution was reduced from 591.5 ppm to 209.9 ppm (64%). The obtained spheres have a nickel adsorption capacity of approximately 3.816 mg/g, which is in agreement with other works of literature [61–63]."
11,"US-ECHSA of α,β-unsaturated ketones in water","3.7 US-ECHSA of α,β-unsaturated ketones in water Hydrogenation selectivity control of α,β-unsaturated ketones and aldehydes is a widely studied topic [11–14,24,60]. Considerable efforts has gone into learning how to hydrogenate the CO bond and retain the CC bond to produce α,β-unsaturated alcohols (allylic alcohols), which are useful in the fine chemicals industry. As already pointed out, it is a difficult task since CC bond hydrogenation is thermodynamically favored over CO hydrogenation. In this sense, the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated ketones gives a saturated ketone (SONE) as majority product, while the CO bond hydrogenation gives an unsaturated alcohol (UOL). Both SONE and UOL can be further hydrogenated in saturated alcohol (SOL). Table 2 shows the comparison between different ECH procedures described in the literature and the US-ECHSA process described in this work for a variety of α,β-unsaturated ketones. As expected, the conjugated CC bond of the 2-cyclohexen-1-one was more easily hydrogenated than CO (Table 2, entry 1) and 2-cyclohexenol was not detected in the reaction mixture. After 1 F mol−1, the use of US improves the ECH process leading to hydrogenation product yield of 100% (Table 2, entry 1), being this result comparable others well established ECH procedures (Table 2, entries 3–5) and 2.5-fold higher than the control reaction in silent condition (Table 2, entry 2). The US-ECHSA of isophorone leads to production of 85.5% of SONE and 5.5% of the SOL (91% total yield, Table 2, entry 6), which represents an increase of 66% in the hydrogenation product yield when compared to the control reaction at silent conditions (Table 2, entry 7). The ECH of isophorone to dihydroisophorone has been extensively studied under different experimental conditions, on nickel electrode material (Table 2, entries 8–10). The hydrogenation of isophorone in methanol systems (32–51% of c.e.; Table 2, entries 8 and 9) was more difficult than in aqueous solution (68% of c.e.; Table 2, entry 10). In recent work, our group [60] observed that, using β-CD as inverse phase transfer catalyst on ECHSA of isophorone, both c.e. and hydrogenation yield increases. The authors attribute the results to the enhancement of isophorone concentration in the aqueous media due to the formation of inclusion complex with β-CD. In aqueous systems, the c.e. in presence of β-CD was approximately 3-fold lower (68%, Table 2, entry 10) than that obtained in aqueous solution irradiated by US (193%, Table 2, entry 6). Concerning the selectivity, the presence of gem-dimethyl and methyl groups at C5 and C3, respectively, hinders isophorone adsorption at the catalyst surface (Eq. (4)) and, as a consequence, increase the selectivity of the ECH/ECHSA process, except in presence of US (94% of selectivity, Table 2, entry 6). Interestingly, at the experimental conditions used, the yield of dihydroisophorol was clearly improved by the presence of US (5.5%, Table 2, entry 6) showing that, not only steric hindrance influences the selectivity but also the energy released into the system by the US irradiation, as previously discussed. The (S)-(+)-carvone, a conjugated cyclohexenone which contains an additional exocyclic CC bond was also hydrogenated in presence of US (Table 2, entry 11). Similarly to the other previously cited substrates, under US irradiation occurs the enhancement of the hydrogenation yields (89.5%, Table 2, entry 11) when compared to that obtained in silent reaction (26%, Table 2, entry 12). As expected, the conjugated endocyclic CC bond was hydrogenated in preference to the vinylic bond and trans-dihydrocarvone was the main product formed (88%, Table 2, entry 11). Indeed, the trans isomer of dihydrocarvone is kinetically favored due to the adsorption of the conjugated double bond of the (S)-(+)-carvone on the nickel catalyst surface (Eq. (4)) be less hindered since the two alkyl groups substituents be located in the equatorial orientation. The ECH of the exocyclic CC bond occurred at low rate producing small amounts of carvomenthone (1.5%, Table 2, entry 11). Finally, the US-ECHSA of (S)-(+)-carvone was more selective than others well established ECH/ECHSA procedures and, concerning to the c.e., was much more efficient (Table 2, entry 11) regardless the type of solvent and catalyst used (Table 2, entries 13 and 14). Acetylcyclohexene, with a trisubstituted endocyclic double bond, is more difficult to hydrogenate (Table 2, entry 15) than 2-cyclohexen-1-one with a disubstituted double bond (Table 2, entry 1), as expected again from steric effects. Under US irradiation, the hydrogenation yields increases (83%, Table 2, entry 15) when compared to that obtained in silent reaction (37%, Table 2, entry 16). In aqueous-methanol systems, the charge required to hydrogenate the acetylcyclohexene was 4-fold higher (4.2 and 4 F mol−1, Table 2, entries 17 and 18, respectively) than that obtained in aqueous solution irradiated by US (1 F mol-1, Table 2, entry 15). Finally, regarding the electrochemical efficiencies observed in entries 1, 6, 11 and 15, notice that the easy of CC bond hydrogenation decreases in the following order: 2-cyclohexen-1-one > acetylcyclohexene > isophorone > carvone, corroborating the literature data [14]. Apocarotenoids are a class of terpenoid compounds, which include some important volatile compounds such as β-ionone and α-ionone. As expected for both apocarotenoids, the CC bond was hydrogenated faster than the CO bond, producing SONEs with good hydrogenation yields (77.5% and 71%, Table 2, entries 19 and 21). Due to the extension of the conjugation of the β-ionone, the US-ECHSA produced dihydro-β-ionone (60.5%), as major product, and tetrahydro-β-ionone (17%) as minor product. Conversely, the ECH of β-ionone at fractal Ni cathode in aqueous methanol leads to hydrogenation of the less substituted CC, i.e, to dihydro-β-ionone with 99% of selectivity after 89% conversion and 28% of c.e (Table 2, entry 20). Regarding to α-ionone, the US-ECHSA was selective to produce dihydro-α-ionone with 71% of c.e. (Table 2, entry 21). The US-ECHSA process revealed to be useful to synthesize methyl isobutyl ketone (93.5% yield, Table 2, entry 22), a valuable industrial solvent used for paint and other protective coatings. The process was also suitable to produce 2-methyl-cyclopentanone from 2-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one with excellent hydrogenation yields (Table 2, entry 23)."
12,Conclusion,"Ultrasound-assisted approach resulted in significant enhancement of the ECH process, reaction time and product yields where improved when compared to other well stablished ECH procedures describe in literature. The optimum US parameters observed were 20 kHz frequency, 14 W of power in continuous mode without control of temperature. The ECHSA process was facilitated by the high temperature and pressure associated with cavity implosions near electrode surface. The chemical reactivity of the catalyst surface was altered by acoustic streaming and cavitation. At low power, pulses of ultrasound had a small stereochemical effect in the distribution of the (R)-(+)-pulegone hydrogenated products. Conversely, at higher power, pulses of ultrasound restore the product distribution. The production of H radicals under US irradiation, occurred in addition to the electrochemical method; this synergetic effect undoubtedly improves the ECHSA process, leading to excellent yields and c.e. over 100%. Based on this investigation, US-ECH of α,β-unsaturated ketones using a sacrificial anode could be a very promising process for saturated ketones production in water."
