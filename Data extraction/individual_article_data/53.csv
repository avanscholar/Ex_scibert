0,Introduction,"The continuous reduction of fossil fuel resources and the increase in consumer demand have led to an rapid growth of renewable chemical market [1,2]. Fatty alcohols, as an important intermediate and high-value chemical with global consumption of around 4.6 million tonnes in 2016, have been widely used to produce lubricants, food additives, and pharmaceuticals [3]. Currently, fatty alcohols (approximately 85% of total production) were mainly produced by converting non-renewable raw materials [4]. The use of bio-renewable raw materials rich in fatty acids such as vegetable oils and waste cooking oils to produce fatty alcohols will be very appealing and has attracted growing attention [5]. However, due to the intrinsic resistance of fatty acids to reduction, current industrial production of fatty alcohols was mainly produced over the Cu-Cr based catalysts under harsh conditions (250–350 °C and 10–20 MPa) [6–8]. Apart from the harsh reaction conditions, the environmental pollution and toxicity problems caused by chromium-containing catalysts have also greatly limited their applications. In this regard, it would be of much interest to seek an efficient and environmental-friendly Cr-free catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of fatty acids into fatty alcohols under mild reaction conditions. Doping Cu with promoters such as boron can eliminate the usage of Cr and the reaction can be performed at moderate reaction temperature of 240 °C and lower H2 pressures (on the order of 10 MPa) [9]. But, from an industrial point of view, the high H2 pressure as a result of low hydrogenation activity of metal copper is still a drawback. In order to achieve the conversion of fatty acids to corresponding alcohols at a low H2 pressure, in recent decades, researchers have focused on noble metal or their derived bimetallic catalysts [10–13]. For example, Hardacre et al. [14] reported that the carboxylic acids could be converted into alcohols with high efficiency over the Pt/TiO2 catalyst at 130 °C and 2 MPa, achieving 82% conversion and 93% selectivity to alcohols. Although noble metal catalysts show high performance for the conversion of fatty acids, seeking more abundant and economic catalysts to replace these expensive noble metals will be desirable. Unfortunately, in comparison with noble metal catalysts, the non-precious metal catalysts seem to be powerless in the hydrogenation of fatty acids to alcohols under mild reaction conditions. Since non-precious metal catalysts usually require high reaction temperatures and hydrogen pressures to ensure their high catalytic hydrogenation activity. The high reaction temperature usually results in the occurrence of unwanted side reactions during the selective hydrogenation of fatty acids to alcohols, such as the decarbonylation of aldehyde intermediate and dehydration of alcohols [15]. Hence, developing an efficient non-noble metal catalyst system for the selective hydrogenation of fatty acids to alcohols at mild reaction conditions has turned into a great challenge. Supported Ni and Co-based catalysts have received widespread attention and applied in many hydrogenation fields such as the hydrodeoxygenation of fatty acids or esters because of their low costs and high hydrogenation activity [16–20]. However, it shows high propensity for C–C bond cracking and decarboxylation when monometallic Ni is used to catalyze hydrogenation of fatty acids, which results in a low selectivity toward fatty alcohols and high selectivity to short-chain alkanes [21]. To inhibit the occurrence of the side reactions, modification of metallic Ni with another adjacent metal, such as alloying Ni with Fe [22,23], Zn [24], and Cu [25,26], or decorating metal Ni catalyst with appropriate metal oxides [27–29], is generally adopted to regulate product selectivity, for which the geometric/electronic properties of metallic Ni can be adjusted by another adjacent metal. For example, Wang et al. [21] reported that SiO2 supported monometallic Ni mainly occurred decarbonylation/decarboxylation in the selective hydrogenation of methyl esters, forming alkanes as primary products, while SiO2 supported Ni2In3 intermetallic compound greatly suppressed the occurrence of the side reactions, giving fatty alcohols as main products. Similarity, Kong et al. [22] found that the formation of Ni3Fe alloy could suppress the decarbonylation of intermediate fatty aldehyde and enhance the selectivity of stearic alcohol in the conversion of stearic acid. Apart from alloying Ni with other metals to inhibit the occurrence of side reactions and to improve the alcohol yield, modification of metallic Ni with appropriate metal oxides may be a simple and effective strategy to regulate the selective hydrogenation performance of the metallic Ni because of their unique synergistic effects in hydrogenation reactions [30,31]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the use of metal oxide-modified metallic Ni catalysts for selective hydrogenation of fatty acids to alcohols has not been reported so far. Also, the selective hydrogenation mechanism of fatty acids on the metal oxide-modified Ni catalyst is unclear. Therefore, we believe that this work will provide a paradigm for the hydrogenation of fatty acids to produce alcohols by virtue of the synergistic effect of nickel and metal oxide. In the present study, various metal oxide-modified metallic Ni catalysts were tested in the selective hydrogenation of stearic acid to stearyl alcohol. Impressively, MoOx-modified Ni/CeO2 catalyst shows excellent catalytic performance (98.0% conversion of stearic acid and 96.2% selectivity of stearyl alcohol) at mild reaction conditions (235 °C and 3.0 MPa H2 pressure), while monometallic Ni/CeO2 catalyst only shows 6.3% conversion of stearic acid under the identical reaction conditions. In order to better understand and design highly active catalyst system for the selective hydrogenation of fatty acids to alcohols, the bimetallic catalyst structure and their physicochemical properties are analyzed and associated with their corresponding intrinsic catalytic activity. The possible reaction mechanism is proposed for the first time and discussed on the basis of the detailed characterization and reaction investigations. In addition, the influences of several crucial variables, such as reaction time, temperature, heating rate, and hydrogen pressure, are also investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (purity, 98.0%), (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (purity, 99.9%), (NH4)6H2W12O40·xH2O (purity, 99.5%), NH4VO3 (99.9%), (NH4)NbO(C2O4)2·xH2O (99.9%), and Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (purity, 98.0%) were purchased from Macklin (Shanghai, China). γ-Al2O3 (purity, 99.99%), CeO2 (purity, 99.99%), active carbon, ZrO2 (purity, 99.99%), and m-TiO2 (purity, 99.8%) were purchased from Aladdin. Oleic acid (99.0%), stearic acid (99.0%), palmitic acid (99%), lauric acid (99%), and pentadecanoic acid (99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used without further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The Ni-MoOx/CeO2 bimetallic catalysts with varying Ni to Mo ratios (0, 0.5, 1, and 2, and 5) were prepared by impregnating CeO2 with an mixed aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O. After evaporating the water at 80 °C, the synthesized catalyst was dried at 100 °C for 12 h, and then calcined at 400 °C for 4 h in air. The loading amount of Ni was fixed at 10 wt%, while the Mo loading was varied by changing the ratio of Ni to Mo (the actual loading amount of the metal was listed in Table S1). The bimetallic catalysts were denoted as Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (X:Y), where X:Y represents the atomic molar ratio of Ni:Mo. The monometallic Ni/CeO2 and MoOx/CeO2 catalysts have the same Ni and Mo loading amounts as the bimetallic Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst, respectively. Other metal oxide-impregnated Ni-MOx/CeO2 (M = Nb, W, V, and Mn, the atomic ratio of Ni:M = 1:1) catalysts were prepared using the identical impregnating method. Prior to use, the calcined catalysts were reduced at 500 °C for 2 h in pure hydrogen (50 mL/min)."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were recorded by using an X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 0.15418 nm) radiation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) were performed in a JEOL JEM-2010 with operating at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis of the samples were performed on an ESCALab 250 X-ray spectrometer. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra was recorded on JEOL EMX EPR spectrometer with operating at 77 K by using an X-band (9.65 GHZ and 0.94 m). Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were performed on a FINESORB 3010 instrument, and the detailed operating procedures can be found elsewhere [32]. The in situ FT-IR spectra of CO adsorption was conducted on a Nicolet-iS50 FT-IR. The reduced Ni/CeO2 and Ni-MoOx/CeO2 catalyst were pretreated by He purging at 25 °C for 30 min. Then, the sample was treated with pure CO at a gas flow rate of 30 mL/min at 25 °C. The FT-IR spectra was recorded following adsorption of CO at 25 °C, subsequently, the desorption of CO in He flowing at 25 °C. The IR spectra of adsorbed butanoic acid was characterized using the same equipment as that used for CO chemisorption. After reduced in-situ at 500 °C for 1 h, the sample was cooled to 50 °C in an H2 flow. Subsequently, butanoic acid was introduced into the sample cell, and the adsorption was performed for 30 min. Finally, the IR spectra were recorded at 50 °C, 100 °C, 150 °C, 200 °C, 300 °C, 350 °C, and 400 °C."
5,Reactivity measurements and product analysis,"2.4 Reactivity measurements and product analysis The catalytic performance test for the hydrogenation of fatty acids was carried out in a 50 mL autoclave reactor at a stirring speed of 1000 rpm. Typically, active catalyst (0.05 g), reactant (0.1 g), and solvent (cyclohexane, 10 mL) were added into the autoclave reactor. Then, the autoclave was sealed and purged with H2 three times to remove air in the reactor, and then pressurized to 3.0 MPa H2. The autoclave was heated from room temperature to 235 °C at a desired heating rate. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled and collected. The liquid products were analyzed by using gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890A/5975C) equipped with the flame ionization detector (FID) and a HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The operating conditions of chromatography were as follows: the detector temperature: 320 °C; injector temperature: 320 °C; oven temperature: ramped from 150 °C (2 min) to 320 °C (10 min) at a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1. Eicosane was used as internal standard to quantify the products. All the experiments were repeated at least two times with errors less than 5% and the data shown in this work was the mean value of repeated experiments. The conversion of substrate and the selectivity of products were calculated using the following the Eqs. (1) and (2) [33]: (1) Conversion = mol initial reactant - mol unreacted reactant mol initial reactant × 100 \% (2) Selec . detect . products = mol product × n C atoms in product mol total C atoms of in detected liquid products × 100 %"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Fig. 1 (a) shows the XRD patterns of calcined catalysts at 400 °C for 4 h in air. As for monometallic Ni/CeO2 and MoOx/CeO2 catalysts, except for the observed strong diffraction peaks of pure CeO2 (JCPDS # 34-0394), the diffraction peaks of the NiO (JCPDS # 47-1049) and MoO3 crystalline phases (JCPDS # 35-0609) were also observed, respectively. For the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 bimetallic catalysts with different molar ratio of Ni:Mo, the diffraction peaks of NiO and MoO3 showed a different behavior from the monometallic catalysts. In the XRD patterns of the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (2:1) and (1:1) bimetallic catalysts, there is no any diffraction peak of MoO3 observed, indicating that the presence of NiO can promote the dispersion of Mo species. Similarity, the presence of Mo species decreases the intensity of NiO diffraction peak as compared with the monometalic Ni/CeO2 catalyst under the same Ni content, indicating that the presence of Mo species can favor the dispersion of NiO. Additionally, it is noted that the obvious diffraction peaks of NiMoO4 were observed in the bimetallic Ni-MoOx/CeO2 catalysts. In particular, when the Ni:Mo = 1, there are no characteristic diffraction peaks of the MoO3 and NiO observed, and only two some broad and weak diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.3 and 27.0° corresponding to the characteristic diffraction peaks of NiMoO4 were observed [32], which suggests that all of Ni and Mo species in the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst are involved in the formation of highly dispersed NiMoO4. The molecular nature of the oxide species presented on the calcined monometallic and bimetallic catalysts was further identified by Raman spectra. As shown in Fig. 1(b), Ni/CeO2 catalyst showed a weak and broad Ni-O stretching band at 500–550 cm−1 [34], while the MoOx/CeO2 catalyst showed three sharp characteristic bands of MoO3 at ~665 cm−1, ~818 cm−1 and ~995 cm−1 [35,36]. Compared with those of calcined monometallic catalysts, Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1), Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (2:1), and Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:2) bimetallic catalysts showed three typical characteristic absorption bands of NiMoO4 in the wavenumber range of 600–100 cm−1: one band was located at 708 cm−1 ascribed to the V s (Ni-O-Mo) vibrational mode of NiMoO4; another two bands were at 914 cm−1 and 963 cm−1 with a shoulder at 947 cm−1, which were the characteristic V a (MO) and V s (MO) vibrational modes of the NiMoO4 species, respectively [37]. These results confirm the formation of NiMoO4 species and are consistent with the XRD characteristic results. Moreover, compared with the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (2:1) and Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:2) bimetallic catalysts, the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) only exhibited characteristic bands of NiMoO4 phase and the intensity of characteristic bands was the most strongest, which further proved that all of Ni and Mo species added to catalyst were participated with the formation of NiMoO4 phase in the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst. To analysis the redox behavior and the interaction between mixed metal oxides, H2-TPR analyse was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the monometallic Ni/CeO2 catalyst showed a remarkable peak at around 360 °C (Ni2+ to Ni0) [38], whereas the MoOx/CeO2 catalyst displayed two H2 consumption peaks, a weak peak at around 500 °C (Mo6+ to Mo5+ and Mo4+) and a strong peak at around 650 °C (Mo4+ to Mo0) [39]. By contrast, bimetallic Ni-MoOx catalysts showed different redox behaviors as compared with monometallic Ni/CeO2 and MoOx/CeO2 catalysts. In the case of bimetallic Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst, the H2 consumption peak attributed to the reduction of NiO was shifted to higher temperature, whereas the peak ascribing to the reduction of MoO3 was shifted to lower temperature or disappeared. This result indicates that there is a strong interaction between Ni and Mo species in the bimetallic Ni-MoOx/CeO2. As for the reduction process of bimetallic catalysts, the H2 consumption peak attributed to the reduction of MoO3 at high temperature (650 °C) became very weak as compared with that of the MoOx/CeO2 catalyst, while the H2 consumption peak between 428 °C and 550 °C was significantly enhanced. Based on the results observed in Fig. 1(a) and (b), we learned that the main compound was NiMoO4 in the bimetallic Ni-MoOx catalysts. Therefore, we infer that the peak between 428 °C and 550 °C in the bimetallic catalysts can be attributed to the reduction of NiMoO4. As for the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (2:1) catalyst, a strong peak with the center of reduction peak at 395 °C was observed, which can be attributed to the reduction of excess NiO in the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (2:1) catalyst. The XRD patterns of the reduced catalysts were shown in Fig. 2(b). As for the monometallic Ni/CeO2, a strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 44.6° was observed, corresponding to the Ni (111) metal facet (JCPDS#04-0850), while a peak at 2θ = 26.1° was observed for MoOx/CeO2, assigning to the MoO2 crystal phase diffraction peak (JCPDS#73-1249). For the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 bimetallic catalysts with different molar ratio of Ni:Mo, after reduction at 500 °C for 2 h under H2 atmosphere, the diffraction peak intensity of metallic Ni was decreased as compared with that of momometallic Ni/CeO2 under the same nickel loading. The result indicates that the introduction of Mo species promotes the dispersion of metallic Ni throng the interaction between Ni and MoOx. It is noted that, in the XRD pattern of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1), neither the metallic Ni nor MoO2 diffraction peaks were observed, indicating that metallic Ni and MoO2 may be highly dispersed on the surface of CeO2 support, and that there is the strongest interaction between Ni and MoOx in the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst. To directly observe the distribution of the metal elements on the surface of CeO2, TEM observations were made. As shown in Fig. 3 (a, b), many black metal nanoparticles were observed on the Ni/CeO2 and Ni-MoOx/CeO2 catalysts, indicating that the Ni and/or Mo species have been successfully dispersed on the surface of CeO2 support. Compared with the Ni/CeO2 catalyst, the metal particles on the surface of the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 catalyst are better dispersed. Moreover, based on the results calculated from CO chemical adsorption, the dispersion of metal Ni was increased from 0.05% (Ni/CeO2) to 1.04% (Ni-MoOx/CeO2). These results suggest that the introduction of Mo species promotes the dispersion of metal Ni, which is consistent with the XRD results analyzed in Fig. 2(b). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) was used to analyze the chemical state of Ni and Mo species by calculating the lattice spacing of the metal. In the HRTEM image of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 catalyst (Fig. 3(c)), a typical lattice spacing of 0.203 nm was detected, which corresponds to the lattice spacing of Ni (111) [40]. Moreover, a lattice space of 0.236 was also detected in the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 catalyst, according to prior work [32], the lattice space can be attributed to amorphous MoOx. In order to further directly observe the dispersion of Ni and Mo species on the surface of the CeO2 support, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping and HADDF-STEM line scanning of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 catalyst were performed. The EDX mapping results suggest that the Ni and Mo species are successfully dispersed on the surface of CeO2. More importantly, it is noted that Ni is covered by MoOx species. This structure is similar to the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) behavior, where a metal surface is partially covered with suboxide species generated by the partially reduction of the reducible oxide [41–43]. This result indicates that the MoOx species interacts with Ni in a weak way, as proved by the H2-TPR results. Additionally, the HADDF-STEM line scanning result (Fig. 3(e)) reveals that the Ni species are adjacent to MoOx. Based on the above results, it is concluded that the introduction of Mo species promotes the dispersion of Ni species, and that the metal Ni is decorated by the MoOx species through the interaction between Ni and Mo species. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to investigate the chemical state of metal elements and possible electronic structure information between Ni and MoOx species. Fig. 4 (a) shows the Ni 2p XPS spectra, in which the peaks at 852.5, 855.8, and ~861.8 eV in Ni/CeO2 catalyst were assigned to Ni0, Ni2+, and its shakeup satellite peak, respectively [44]. For the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) bimetallic catalyst, the Ni0 deconvoluted peak shifted to a higher binding energy of 852.7 eV as compared with 852.5 eV for Ni0 in monometallic Ni/CeO2. This result indicates a charge transfer from the metallic Ni to Mo in the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) bimetallic catalyst. In addition, compared with the Ni/CeO2 catalyst (10.9%), the higher amounts of Ni0 (23.6% obtained by areal percentage) were obtained in the XPS spectra of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst, indicating that the Mo species may promote the reduction of NiO by promoting the dispersion of nickel species. The Mo 3d spectra were also deconvoluted, as shown in Fig. 4(b), and the deconvoluted peaks locating at about 229.1 eV, 231.8 eV and 232.3 eV were assigned to Mo4+, Mo5+ and Mo6+, respectively [45]. Compared with the MoOx/CeO2 catalyst (48.2%), the higher amounts of Mo4+ and Mo5+ (54.5%) were obtained in the XPS spectra of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst, indicating that metal Ni promotes the reduction of MoO3. This results can be explained by the effect of hydrogen spillover from Ni to Mo-oxide, thereby promoting the reduction of MoO3. To further explore the influence of the introduced Mo species on the surface structure of catalysts, the in-situ FT-IR of CO adsorption and desorption over the Ni/CeO2 and Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) were performed. As shown in Fig. 5 (a, b), the adsorption peak located at around 2140 cm−1 could be attributed to CO linear adsorption, in which CO probe molecule was linearly bonded on the Ni0 (CO-Ni0) [46]. Compared with the peak position of the monometallic Ni/CeO2 catalyst, a blue shift (from 2142.0 to 2143.9 cm−1) on the bimetallic Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) was observed, suggesting that the electron density of Ni decreased and an electron transfer was occurred in the Ni0. This results are consistent with the electron transfer from Ni to Mo as proved by XPS spectra. Additionally, it is observed that the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) displays a higher CO adsorption intensity as compared with the Ni/CeO2 catalyst. This may be ascribed to the high dispersion of Ni in the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst, which promotes the adsorption of CO probe molecule. Fig. 5(c, d) shows the in-situ FT-IR spectra of CO desorption on the Ni/CeO2 and Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalysts. Noted that the CO desorption spectra of the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) displays a different behavior as compared with that of Ni/CeO2 catalyst. Compared with the Ni/CeO2 catalyst, after 10 min of desorption in a He flow, the adsorption peak observed near 2140 cm−1 almost completely disappeared in the spectra of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1), suggesting a weakened strength of CO chemisorption for Ni0 in the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1). This result can be attributed to electronic effect: a reduction of electron density of Ni in the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst decreases the electron back-donation from d orbitals of Ni to π* orbital of CO, which results in weak interaction between Ni and CO molecular. Based on the above results observed in the XPS spectra and in-situ FT-IR of CO adsorption and desorption, it is concluded that there is a strong interaction between Ni and Mo species, and that the introduction of Mo species promotes a charge transfer from Ni to Mo. To detect the existence of the oxygen vacancy on the catalysts, the EPR analyse was performed. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), the tested samples all showed a pair of steep peaks with a symmetric distribution in accordance with a Vo signal at g = 2.002, an indication of electron trapping at oxygen vacancy [47]. Compared with the monometallic Ni/CeO2 catalyst with relative weak EPR signal, the signal of the bimetallic Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst was remarkably enhanced. This results indicate that the oxygen vacancy of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst is mainly created via the reduction of Mo species. On the other hand, the XPS O 1s spectra (Fig. 6(b)) of Ni/CeO2 and Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalysts further proved the existence of oxygen vacancy, where the peaks located at 529.5, 530–531.1, and 531.9 eV corresponded to the lattice oxygen (OL), hydroxide (OH), and oxygen vacancy (OV), respectively [48,49]. As shown in Fig. 6(b), compared with monometallic Ni/CeO2 catalyst (21.0%), the higher amounts of oxygen vacancy (37.5%) were obtained in the XPS spectra of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst, indicating that the introduction of Mo species increases the concentration of the oxygen vacancy. These results reveal that the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) bimetallic catalyst has abundant oxygen vacancies, and the oxygen vacancy is primary created by the reduction of molybdenum oxide."
8,Catalyst screening for selective hydrogenation of stearic acid to stearyl alcohol,"3.2 Catalyst screening for selective hydrogenation of stearic acid to stearyl alcohol In order to select the best metal oxide modifier, various metal oxide-modified Ni/CeO2 catalysts were applied in the selective hydrogenation of stearic acid to stearyl alcohol. As listed in Table 1 , the main product was stearyl alcohol, while a certain amount of n-heptadecane (n-C17 alkane) and n-octadecane (n-C18 alkane) were generated as by-products. After 3 h reaction at 235 °C and 3.0 MPa H2 pressure, Ni-MoOx/CeO2 and Ni-VOx/CeO2 showed high catalytic activities for the conversion of stearic acid, whose the main product was stearyl alcohol (Table 1, entries 3 and 6). Ni-WOx/CeO2 showed moderate activity, and giving the 52.3% total selectivity to C17 and C18 alkanes with C18 alkane being the main product (Table 1, entry 5). According the prior reports [50,51], we learned that the WOx had abundant Brønsted acid sites, which is beneficial to promote the dehydration of alcohols. Therefore, the high selectivity of C18 alkane obtained on Ni-WOx/CeO2 catalyst is mainly due to the fact that the Ni-WOx/CeO2 promotes the dehydration-hydrogenation process of stearyl alcohol under the action of Brønsted acid sites. As for Ni-NbOx/CeO2 and Ni-MnOx/CeO2 catalysts (Table 1, entries 2 and 4), they showed relatively low catalytic activity for the conversion of stearic acid. Additionally, it is noted that, compared with the activity of metal oxide-modified Ni/CeO2, monometallic Ni/CeO2 catalyst showed very low activity in the conversion of stearic acid under the identical reaction conditions (Table 1, entry 1). Based on the above results, it can be concluded that the MnOx, NbOx, and WOx are unfavorable metal oxide modifiers for the conversion of stearic acid to stearyl alcohol, and that selecting suitable metal oxide to modify the metal Ni can greatly improve the activity of Ni/CeO2 and selectivity to stearyl alcohol. In terms of the catalyst activity and selectivity to stearyl alcohol, the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 is selected for the subsequent experiments. To explore the impact of support, the bimetallic Ni-MoOx supported on different supports were synthesized and employed in the conversion of stearic acid. The results showed that γ-Al2O3, active carbon, and CeO2 supported Ni-MoOx catalysts showed high activity for the conversion of stearic acid (Table 1, entries 3, 7, and 9), while the m-TiO2 and ZrO2 supported Ni-MoOx catalysts showed moderate activity under the identical reaction conditions, giving the 56–63% conversion of stearic acid (Table 1, entries 8 and 10). As for the selectivity to steayl alcohol, CeO2, m-TiO2, and ZrO2 supported Ni-MoOx gave more than 90% selectivity to stearyl alcohol (Table 1, entries 3, 8, and 10), while active carbon and γ-Al2O3 supported Ni-MoOx catalysts promoted the conversion of stearyl alcohol, giving 41–74% total selectivity to C17 and C18 alkanes with C18 alkane being major product (Table 1, entries 7 and 9). Considering both catalyst activity and selectivity to stearyl alcohol, it is concluded that Ni-MoOx/CeO2 is the best catalyst system for the selective hydrogenation of stearic acid to stearyl alcohol. The effect of Mo/Ni atomic ratio was investigated to optimize the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 catalyst in the conversion of stearic acid. As displayed in Table 2 , the monometallic Ni/CeO2 and MoOx/CeO2 catalysts were less active, giving less than 10% conversion (Table 2, entries 1 and 6). In contrast, bimetallic Ni-MoOx/CeO2 catalysts under the identical reaction conditions gave more than 90% conversion to stearic acid (Table 2, entries 2–5). This result indicates that the Ni and MoOx species of bimetallic Ni-MoOx/CeO2 are essential for the conversion of stearic acid at 235 °C and 3.0 MPa H2 pressure. As for the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 bimetallic catalysts with different molar ratio of Ni:Mo, the primary products were n-heptadecane (C17 alkane), n-octadecane (C18 alkane), and stearyl alcohol. With an decrease in Ni/Mo atomic ratio, the selectivity of stearyl alcohol first increased from 75.6% of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (2:1) catalyst to the maximum value of 96.2% for the best Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst and then decreased gradually to 51.4% of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:2) catalyst. It is noted that the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (2:1) and (5:1) bimetallic catalysts generated much C17 alkane (Table 2, entries 4 and 5), while Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:2) bimetallic catalyst produced much C18 alkane (Table 2, entry 3). This may be due to the fact that excessive nickel compound would form large metal particle (as shown in Fig. 2(b)), promoting the dehydrogenation-decarbonylation process of stearyl alcohol to form C17 alkane, while excessive molybdenum compound would increase the number of Brønsted acid sites of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 [45], promoting the dehydration-hydrogenation process of stearyl alcohol to form C18 alkane. Therefore, the excellent activity of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst, which is chosen for subsequent experiments, is mainly attributed to the well-distribution of Ni and Mo species."
9,Effect of reaction conditions on the catalytic activity and substrate scope,"3.3 Effect of reaction conditions on the catalytic activity and substrate scope In order to obtain the maximum yield of stearyl alcohol, the optimum reaction time was investigated over the superior bimetallic catalyst of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1). As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the conversion of stearic acid increased with increasing the reaction time, and the main product was stearyl alcohol (C18-OH). When the reaction time was 180 min, a high conversion (98.0%) and selectivity to stearyl alcohol (96.2%) were obtained. As the reaction time further increased from 180 to 230 min, the selectivity of stearyl alcohol gradually decreased with the reaction time, whereas the selectivity of alkane products gradually increased. The results suggest, due to prolonged time contact with the catalyst, the produced stearyl alcohol would undergo dehydrogen-decarbonylation or dehydration-hydrogenation side reaction process to form alkanes. Moreover, the effect of reaction temperature on the selective hydrogenation of stearic acid was also investigated. As deduced from Fig. 7(b), the reaction temperature has a great effect on catalyst activity. At a low temperature of 225 °C, the conversion of stearic acid was 72.5%. As the temperature increased from 225 to 235 °C, the conversion of stearic acid and selectivity of stearyl alcohol significantly enhanced and got the highest selectivity of 96.2% to stearyl alcohol at 235 °C. When the temperature further increased to 250 °C, the side reactions would be facilitated, where about 74.0% of alkane was produced (47.2% C17 alkane and 26.8% C18 alkane). Fig. 7(c) shows that the H2 pressure also influences the catalyst activity and product distribution. As H2 pressure increased from 1.0 MPa to 3.0 MPa, a notable increase of both the conversion and selectivity to stearyl alcohol can be observed. Further increasing the H2 pressure from 3.0 MPa to 4.0 MPa did not obviously lead to further increase for selectivity of stearyl alcohol. In addition, the heating rate effect suggested that the higher heating rate can significantly improve the catalyst activity and selectivity of stearyl alcohol, as shown in Fig. 7(d). On the basis of the above results and principle of minimum energy consumption, 180 min of reaction time, 3.0 MPa of H2 pressure, 235 °C of reaction temperature, and 20 °C min−1 of heating rate were chosen. Then, various long-chain fatty acids, such as oleic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, and pentadecanoic acid, were tested over the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst under the optimized reaction conditions. As listed in Table 3 , most of reactants were efficiently converted and showed high selectivity to corresponding fatty alcohols (Table 3, entries 2–5), except oleic acid (Table 3, entry 1). This may be due to the fact that the unsaturated CC bond in oleic acid could consume a large amount of hydrogen, which hinders the further hydrogenation of stearic acid to stearyl alcohol. According to the results listed in Table 3, it is concluded that the Ni-MoOx/CeO2 catalyst is an effective catalytic system for converting fatty acids into corresponding fatty alcohol products."
10,Mechanism study,"3.4 Mechanism study To investigate the synergistic effect between Ni and MoOx species in the conversion of fatty acids, the effects of CeO2, Ni, and MoOx on the catalytic activity were studied individually. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), compared with the bimetallic Ni-MoOx/CeO2 catalyst (98.0% conversion and 96.2% selectivity to stearyl alcohol), CeO2 (not shown due to an extremely low conversion), MoOx/CeO2, and Ni/CeO2 showed low catalytic activity (<10% conversion of stearic acid) under the identical reaction conditions. These results suggest that the synergistic effect between Ni and MoOx species is primary responsible for their excellent catalytic performance. To prove this hypothesis, a physical mixture of monometallic Ni/CeO2 and MoOx/CeO2 catalysts was performed where a low conversion (10.5%) and selectivity to stearyl alcohol (68.5%) were obtained, which far lower than the catalytic performance of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (98.0% conversion and 96.2% selectivity of stearyl alcohol). These contrast experiments suggest that the synergistic catalysis between proximate Ni and MoOx species in the bimetallic Ni-MoOx/CeO2 catalyst is essential to improve the catalytic activity and selectivity of fatty alcohols. In order to further illustrate the crucial role of MoOx in the conversion of stearic acid, the catalytic performances of monometallic Ni and bimetallic Ni-MoOx loaded on γ-Al2O3, active carbon, m-TiO2, and ZrO2 were compared under the identical reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 8(b), monometallic Ni loaded on supports showed low activity, while the bimetallic Ni-MoOx loaded on supports relatively efficient promoted the conversion of stearic acid. These results demonstrate the key role of MoOx as active component in the conversion of stearic acid. Based on the above characterizations (XRD, TEM, XPS, and EPR), the vital role of MoOx in the conversion of stearic acid can be mainly attributed to promote the dispersion of metal Ni, provide synergistic catalysis sites of electron-deficient Ni and MoOx species, and abundant oxygen vacancies for the conversion of stearic acid. In order to acquire more information about the adsorption of fatty acids on the Ni and Ni-MoOx catalysts, the in-situ FT-IR spectra technology was performed to study the long-chain fatty acids adsorption on the surface of the Ni/SiO2 and Ni-MoOx/SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 9 ). Here, the butyric acid was used to explore the interaction between fatty acids and catalysts because it has similar functional groups with long-chain fatty acids as well as low boiling point. On the other hand, to avoid the influence of the support, a relatively inert support of SiO2 was used. In case of the Ni/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 9a), the bands centered at 2990–2880 cm−1 were assigned to the C–H stretching vibration of –CH3, –CH2, and –CH [52]. The bands appeared at about 1713, 1467, and 1410 cm−1 corresponded to the characteristic vibration of carbonyl group [53]. As shown in Fig. 9, compared with the Ni/SiO2 catalyst with low adsorption intensity and high desorbed temperature (400 °C) for the butyric acid, the Ni-MoOx/SiO2 catalyst showed a strong adsorption intensity for the reactant molecular, and the adsorbed species could be completely desorbed at a low temperature of 150 °C (Fig. 9b). Additionally, it is noted that, as the temperature increases from 25 to 100 °C, the characteristic band position of the butyric acid in the spectrum of the Ni-MoOx/SiO2 catalyst was obviously shifted to a higher wavenumber (1720 cm−1) with respect to the monometallic Ni/SiO2 catalyst (1713 cm−1). DFT calculation showed that the fatty acids could be more stably adsorbed on the oxygen vacancy as compared with metal Ni (111) [53]. Therefore, we infer that the strong interaction between butyric acid and Ni-MoOx/SiO2 catalyst can be attributed to the interaction between butyric acid and oxygen vacancy from MoOx. These results indicate that the adsorption modes of butyric acid on the Ni/SiO2 and Ni-MoOx/SiO2 catalysts are different and the butyric acid molecule is more easily adsorbed on the surface of the Ni-MoOx/SiO2 catalyst. Another major differences between the spectra of Ni/SiO2 and Ni-MoOx/SiO2 catalysts are the band at 2020 cm−1, ascribing to the linear adsorption of CO on the metal surface [46], and the band at about 1668 cm−1, attributing to the CO stretching of butanal species [54]. As shown in Fig. 9(a), Ni/SiO2 catalyst had a strong interaction with butanal species, for which the butanal species was still detected even when the temperature was reached 200 °C. In contrast, in the spectrum of the Ni-MoOx/SiO2 catalyst, when the temperature was increased to 150 °C, the butanal species has been completely desorbed. Additionally, it is noted that the band of adsorbed CO at 2020 cm−1 only appeared in the spectra of Ni/SiO2. This results indicate that the butanal species has a strong interaction with Ni/SiO2 catalyst, and the strong interaction would weaken the C–C of aldehyde species, resulting in the decarbonylation reaction occurred on the Ni/SiO2 catalyst. According to the above results, it is concluded that the introduction of Mo species not only promotes the adsorption of fatty acid but also inhibits the decarbonylation of fatty acids, which results in high activity and improvement in the selectivity to fatty alcohols. Based on the above results and an inspiration obtained from previously proposed Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism for the reduction of carboxylic acids [55], a possible reaction mechanism for the selective hydrogenation of fatty acids to alcohols is proposed in Scheme 1 . Firstly, dissociated hydrogen chemisorbed on the metal Ni overflows to molybdenum oxide on the interface of Ni-MoOx. There it reacts with lattice oxygen of molybdenum oxide to form water, which creates a oxygen vacancy when the water desorbs. Subsequently, the carboxylic group of fatty acid is activated by the oxygen vacancy. Then, the adjacent Ni metal provides the dissociated hydrogen and subsequently hydrogenates the adsorbed fatty acid species to form unstable aldehyde intermediate, which fast hydrogenated into fatty alcohol on the interface of Ni-MoOx. In the selective hydrogenation mechanism of fatty acids, Ni and MoOx sites of the bimetallic catalyst act synergistically, where Ni dissociates H2 and partially reduced MoOx activates the carbonyl group of fatty acids."
11,Reusability of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst,"3.5 Reusability of Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst Catalyst reusability is essential for potential use of a catalytic process. Thus, the reusability of the catalyst was investigated, and the results are shown in Fig. 10 (a). After the first cycle, the catalyst was recovered by centrifugation, and washed several times with cyclohexane. Then, the obtained catalyst was used in the next reaction cycle. After three recycling tests, the catalytic activity and selectivity to stearyl alcohol were decreased by 25% (from 98.0% to 73.0%) and 42.7% (from 96.2% to 53.5%), respectively. The ICP-OES-MS and XPS characterizations were used to clarify the reason for the deactivation of the catalyst. The ICP-OES-MS results showed that, after reused three times, the loading amounts of the Ni and Mo species were decreased by 1.2 wt% and 1.9 wt%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 10(b). XPS results showed that, compared with the fresh Ni-MoOx/CeO2 (1:1) catalyst, the used catalyst was obviously oxidized after three recycling tests, where the lower amount of Ni0 and the higher amount of Mo6+ were obtained, as shown in Fig. 10(c, d). These results indicate that the deactivation of the catalyst during the three cycles could be due to the leaching of metal species and the oxidation of metal species. To verify the catalyst renewability, the used catalyst was reactivated in H2 atmosphere at 500 °C for 2 h. The result showed that the catalyst activity was significantly improved, where the 90% conversion of stearic acid with 85.3% selectivity to stearyl alcohol was obtained."
12,Conclusion,"In this work, we systematically study the application of metal oxide-modified Ni catalysts in the selective hydrogenation of fatty acids to alcohols. Impressively, MoOx modified Ni/CeO2 catalyst shows the best catalytic performance in the conversion of stearic acid, providing high conversion (98.0%) and selectivity (96.2%) to stearyl alcohol at 235 °C and 3.0 MPa H2 pressure. The obtained findings indicate that the combination of metallic Ni and MoOx is essential to promote the conversion of fatty acids and improve the selectivity of fatty alcohols. More specifically, metallic Ni provides active hydrogen atom for the hydrogenation of fatty acids through dissociating H2, and MoOx with abundant oxygen vacancies activates the carbonyl group of fatty acids, which results in high activity for the conversion of fatty acids and an increase in selectivity to fatty alcohol products."
