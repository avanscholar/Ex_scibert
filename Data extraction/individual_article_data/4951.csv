0,Introduction,"In recent years, the problems of the depletion of fossil fuels and global environmental pollution have been worsening; thus, it is imperative to develop renewable and green fuels [1,2]. Biomass that can be obtained easily from nature is a potential resource to alternative fossil fuel after being processed [3–6]. Aviation contributes approximately 12% CO2 emissions from all transport sources [7]; thus, the production of aviation fuel from biomass, which can regenerate with carbon dioxide via photosynthesis, is very beneficial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Biodiesel, ethanol, and renewable diesel are the three most concerned renewable fuels. However, because of its low flash point, ethanol obviously cannot be used in aviation. Biodiesel composing fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) is produced by the transesterification of oils and fats with methanol [8,9]. Although Biodiesel has been industrialized for many years, due to the low calorific value, high viscosity, high oxygen content and ethanol content, it is also not suitable for application in aviation [10–12]. Hydrocarbons obtained by the hydrogenation of lipids are desirable components to meet the requirements of jet fuel. Many studies have investigated the production of bio-jet fuel from vegetable oil or even wasted feedstock [13–17]. Waste oils are a potential threat to the environment [18,19]; if they are used to produce bio-jet fuel, not only can the problem of jet fuel-shortage be solved but the pressure on the environment can also be greatly relieved. Hydrodeoxidation of fatty acids into aromatics, normal paraffins, and iso-paraffins, which are the main components of jet fuel, is a very complex process, requiring, for example, decarboxylation, decarbonylation, hydrogenolysis and isomerization under the action of multi-functional catalysts with Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, and metal centres [20–22]. Usually, transition metals such as Co, Ni, Cu or noble metals such as Pd and Pt are loaded on C [23,24], ZrO2 [ 25,26], Al2O3 [ 27–29], SiO2 [ 30,31], ZSM-5 [32,33], ZSM-22 [34,35], and SAPO-11 [36,37] to synthesize highly dispersed catalysts for this reaction process. The acidity of supporters represented by C, Al2O3, and SiO2 [38] is very low, and many reports have indicated that the main reaction process of lipids with low acid catalysts is decarboxylation or decarbonylation. Jeong-Geol Na et al. [39] used Pt/C and Pd/C to catalyse oleic acid, the yield of C17 hydrocarbons could reach 72%. Jie Fu et al. [40] investigated the conversion of fatty acids to alkanes over Pt/C in high‐temperature water, and the selectivity of n-alkanes was greater than 90%. Jeffrey P. Ford et al. [41] used Pd/SiO2 and Pd/Al2O3 to convert lauric acid, and the yields of n-undecane could reach 96% and 94%, respectively. However, iso-, cyclic paraffins (70%–85%) and aromatics (25%) with a carbon range between C8 and C16 are the main demand components, and the component ratio of n-paraffins in jet fuel is less than 5% [13]. Compared with C and metal oxides, metal-loaded molecular sieves with proper acid sites that can hydrogenate fatty acids into small molecules are more suitable for commercial applications. Hao Chen et al. [42] investigated hydrogenation of soybean oil by ZSM-5 with different acidity, and the selectivity of C16-C18 hydrocarbons could reach 79.47% when catalysed by NiMo/ZSM-5 with low Brønsted acidity. With increasing Brønsted acidity, the C4-C8 hydrocarbons and aromatics increased gradually. According to our previous studies, up to 64.61 wt% of aromatics could be produced through one-step hydroprocessing of fatty acids over Ni/HZSM-5 with strong acid sites [43]. If catalysed by Ni-loaded SAPO-11 with weak acid sites, a maximum of 67.3 mol% of iso-alkanes could be obtained [44]. Long-chain fatty acids, such as stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), and linolenic acid (C18:3) are abundant in lipids in nature. The C18 fatty acids in soybean oil, jatropha oil, sunflower seed oil, rubber seed oil, and rapeseed account for 90% [45], 84.3% [45], 89% [46], 89.2% [47] and 86.5% [48], respectively. Since waste oils are transformed from natural lipids, it usually also contains abundant long-chain fatty acids of C18 [49]. Therefore, moderate hydrocracking must be carried out to convert waste oil into jet fuel with a range of C8-C16. ZSM-5 with both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites is an excellent catalyst carrier for hydrocracking [42,50,51]. Adjusting the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 is a common method to regulate acid sites [52,53]. However, in current reports, the activity of ZSM-5-based catalysts is stable during the reaction process, making them not conducive to hydrogenation cracking due to the presence of strong metal centres locally. In this study, we designed a novel NiO-LiZSM-5 catalyst, whose relative strength of active centres could be regulated gradually during the reaction process. Nickel oxide particles on ZSM-5, as strong Lewis acid sites, could be reduced into nickel metal centres by H2 in the reaction system. This process enhanced the hydrogenation of waste oil into jet fuel components by reducing C17-C18 carbohydrates. The reaction routes and mechanism were also discussed through careful characterization of the catalysts and the experimental design."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 of 27 was supplied by Nankai University, China. Oleic acid (90 wt%) was purchased from ALDRICH, and the main impurities were palmitic acid and eicosanoic acid (Figure S6). All materials were purchased from commercial suppliers (Table S1) and were not reprocessed before use."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation In this work, lithium-modified ZSM-5 described as xLiZSM-5. After loading with nickel oxide, it was denoted by NiO-xLiZSM-5 and nickel oxide-loaded unpretreated HZSM-5 was denoted as NiO-HZSM-5. For example, HZSM-5 pretreated with 0.02 M LiOH was denoted as 002LiZSM-5; after loading with 10 wt% nickel oxide, it was denoted as 10NiO-002LiZSM-5. NiO-loaded xLiZSM-5 (x = 002, 004, 006, 008, 010) was prepared in two steps. First, HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 27) was pretreated with different concentrations of lithium hydroxide solution. Typically, the stoichiometric amount of LiOH·H2O was dissolved in deionized water to form a 150 ml transparent aqueous solution. To synthesize 010LiZSM-5 (x = 010), 0.6294 g of LiOH·H2O was added to form a 150-ml aqueous solution. Next, 15 g of HZSM-5 was added to the solution and stirred at 60 °C until the mixed solution became neutral. Thereafter, the sample was filtered and washed with deionized water three times. Finally, the sample was dried at 105 °C for 6 h, and a lithium-modified sample was obtained. In the second step, a stoichiometric amount of nickel oxide was loaded onto the sample obtained in the first step. Typically, a 10-g sample and a corresponding stoichiometric amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and C6H8O7·H2O were added to a flask and dissolved in an appropriate amount of ethanol. The molar ratio of C6H8O7·H2O to Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was 1.1:1. Next, the solution was stirred at 60 °C for approximately 1 h and then was dried at 80 °C. Finally, the sample was calcined at 550 °C for 5 h. After cooling in air, the sample was ground and sieved. For comparison, nickel oxide-supported HZSM-5 was also synthesized. The synthesis step was the same as that of the second step."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations Characterizations of the physical and chemical properties and structure of the catalysts are the basis of studying the catalytic mechanism. They were measured using several test instruments, and the equipment parameters were similar to those already reported [54]. Powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) technology using the Japan Science D/max-R Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (k = 0.15406 nm) was used to characterize the crystal phases of the oxygen carriers. The X-ray tube was operated at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. The diffraction angle (2θ) was scanned from 5° to 80°. Elemental analysis of Ni loading was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF; S4 Pioneer, Bruker). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out using equipment by Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, with an Al Ka X-ray source at an operating voltage of 20 kV and a current of 10 mA, under the conditions of 20 eV and 100 eV pass energy for the survey spectra and single-element spectra. The reductive reactivity of samples was evaluated by the hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) instrument, which was conducted in 5.0 vol% H2 balanced with helium at a flow rate of 60 ml/min from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 K/min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S4800 instrument) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL JEM 2100 F) was used to determine the microscopic morphology of the samples. The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was tested using an ASIQACIV200-2 multifunctional chemical adsorption instrument. First, 0.1 g of sample was treated under He flow at 300 °C for 0.5 h at a ramp rate of 40 °C/min. Next, NH3 (99.99%) was adsorbed to saturation after cooling to 100 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the catalyst was heated to 800 °C at a ramp-up rate of 10 K/min to desorb NH3, and the amount of NH3 was detected by TCD. Pyridine of FT-IR (PE Frontier FT-IR Spectrometer) was used to calculate the Brønsted and Lewis acidities of the catalysts respectively. The catalysts were first pretreated under vacuum (10-2 Pa) at 350 °C for 2 h. During the adsorption process, the samples were contacted with saturated pyridine vapor for 0.5 h at room temperature. Finally, the samples were heated to a set temperature and desorbed for 1 h. 1H NMR was performed to confirm the chemical shift of Brønsted acid protons of lithium-promoted ZSM-5 by Bruker Ascend 300 WB using a 4-mm dual resonant solid probe. The variable temperature range was from −120 °C to 300 °C, and the maximum speed was 15 KHz. The thermal stability of the fresh, spent, and refreshed catalysts was characterized by thermogravimetric (TG) texts performed on a simultaneous thermal analyser instrument (SDT650; New Castle, USA) from 100 °C to 900 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min under a mixed flow of 150 ml/min dry air and 100 ml/min N2."
5,Catalyst evaluation,"2.4 Catalyst evaluation The reaction of oleic acid hydrodeoxygenation was performed in a high-temperature and high-pressure reactor with mechanical stirring and a volume of approximately 158 ml. Before the reaction, 0.6 g of catalyst and 10 g of oleic acid were added into the reactor, and air was discharged before 4 Mpa H2 (99.99%) was charged into the reactor. When the reaction proceeded, the reactor was heated to the corresponding temperature at 10 K/min and was kept at the temperature for 0–6 h. During the reaction, the mechanical stirring speed was maintained at 200 rpm. After the reaction, the reactor was placed in a room-temperature water bath for rapid cooling. As reported previously [43,55,56], the gas products were analysed using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a capillary column (GS-GASPRO, 60 m × 0.32 m), and the produced liquid was analysed using an Agilent 7890A-5975C GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) instrument equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a capillary column (DB-5, 30 m ×0.25 mm × 0.25 m). The content of the liquid components was calculated as follow: A m o l % = T h e m o l o f A T h e t o t a l m o l o f l i q u i d c o m p o n e n t s"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of the prepared samples,"3.1 Characterization of the prepared samples All the prepared samples with different lithium exchange amounts showed similar X-ray powder diffraction patterns in the range of 5°-80°. As shown in Fig. 1 a, all data were consistent with HZSM-5 (PDF 00-049-0657). This finding indicates that the lithium ions exchange did not affect the lattice structure of ZSM-5 obviously. For nickel oxide-loaded LiZSM-5, four main peaks at 37.2°, 43.3°, 62.9°, and 75.4° belonged to the nickel oxide particles, a finding that was consistent with the PDF card 00-022-1189. Combining results with SEM images (Fig. 1b), the nickel oxides were confirmed to be well loaded on the molecular sieves, and the particle sizes were all around 17 nm. The nickel-loading sample amount used in this work were all confirmed by XRF and were all consistent with the set amount."
8,Effect of lithium on the prepared samples,"3.2 Effect of lithium on the prepared samples 3.2.1 Activation of the lattice oxygen of nickel oxide XPS was performed to study the electron binding energy of O and Ni on the surface of the prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 2 a, nickel oxide-loaded LiZSM-5 has two peaks at approximately 532.3 eV and 529.5 eV. The peak approximately 532.3 eV belongs to the lattice oxygen of ZSM-5, which could be confirmed by the XPS curve of the parent HZSM-5. Notably the oxygen electron binding energy of ZSM-5 loaded by nickel oxide particles all increased by 0.29 eV. This may be due to the chemical bonds between nickel oxide and ZSM-5. The other peaks approximately 529.5 eV should belong to the lattice oxygen of nickel oxide. Furthermore, the oxygen electron binding energy of nickel oxide loaded on LiZSM-5 was 0.37 eV lower than that on NiO-HZSM-5. This indicates that lithium ions on the surface of LiZSM-5 activated the lattice oxygen of nickel oxide, a finding that was further confirmed by H2-TPR. As shown in Fig. 2c, under the same conditions, the reduction temperature of nickel oxide particles on NiO-HZSM-5 was higher than 431.5 °C while that of nickel oxide particles on lithium-promoted ZSM-5 was reduced to approximately 350 °C. In this reaction system, a proper reduction temperature is a critical factor to achieve a gradual transition from strong Lewis acid sites to metal centres. Because the optimal reaction temperature in this work was 360 °C, nickel oxide on LiZSM-5 would be gradually reduced to nickel when the reaction temperature has risen to approximately 350 °C. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 2b, lithium ions did not cause any valence change of nickel on LiZSM-5, and the 2p orbital peaks of nickel were identical to those of standard nickel oxide [57]. 3.2.2 Acidity regulation Because the acid strength and type of catalysts determine the hydrogenation process of lipids, reasonable regulation of acid sites on catalysts was very important to intensify the reaction. In this work, lithium ions exchange and nickel oxide loading of parent HZSM-5 were used to regulate the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively, which were characterized by NH3-TPD and pyridine infrared spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3 a, four types of acids with different strengths exist in NiO-xLiZSM-5: weak acid sites, medium-strong acid sites, strong acid sites, and super acid sites. With the concentration of lithium hydroxide solution increasing gradually from 0.02 M to 0.08 M, the strength of the four acid sites decreased gradually. Particular attention should be paid to the changes in the strong and super acid sites, which had a significant impact on the reaction process. With the increase in the ion exchange capacity, the desorption temperature of the super acid decreased from 497.1 °C to 438.9 °C, and the desorption temperature of the strong acid decreased from 408.6 °C to 380.4 °C. However, the acid distribution of the sample treated with 0.1 M lithium hydroxide was obviously different; it contained no super acid sites, and the highest desorption temperature was only 387.5 °C. This can be explained by the original Brønsted acid protons of parent HZSM-5 having been completely replaced by lithium ions, which was a change from quantitative to qualitative. Based on the adsorbed pyridine FTIR results (Fig. 3b), it was easily deduced that the Brønsted acidity of 010LiZSM-5 support has been nearly completely eliminated by the exchange of lithium ions, while its Lewis acidity has been greatly enhanced. This was due to the conversion from the Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites [58]. To clarify this phenomenon, we analysed the effect of lithium ion exchange on the protons of the prepared catalysts by 1H NMR. Generally, the bridging hydroxyl group (Site 1 in Fig. 3c) is the Brønsted acid site of HZSM-5. As shown in Fig. 3c, only one peak at 6.0 ppm that belongs to the second bridged hydroxyl group [59] could be found on the parent HZSM-5. After treatment with a low concentration of lithium hydroxide solution (0.02 M-0.08 M), the strong Brønsted protons were partially replaced (Site 2), changing the chemical environment of the proton adsorption sites and forming two different types of protons. Considering 002LiZSM-5 as an example, the protons at 6.0 ppm of the parent HZSM-5 were transformed into two types of protons with chemical shifts of 5.77 ppm and 1.51 ppm. This was mainly due to the electronegativity of the remaining Brønsted acid protons that would decrease after the Brønsted acid protons were partially exchanged. Meanwhile, the new group, in which the proton of the bridging hydroxyl group was replaced by lithium (Site 3), could form a new type of proton after the absorption of water molecules in the air. The chemical shift of the two protons was close to each other until the two peaks coincided as the capacity of lithium ion exchange increased. This is because the increase in the concentration of the alkali solution causes the exchange amount of lithium ion to tend towards saturation, and the chemical environment of the sample will be relatively stable. When the concentration of lithium hydroxide increased to 0.1 M, the lithium ions almost completely displaced the protons of Brønsted acid. The chemical shift in the hydrogen spectrum of 010LiZSM-5 was only 3.64 ppm, which was 2.33 ppm lower than that of the parent HZSM-5. Additionally, the pyridine infrared spectrum showed that the Brønsted acidity decreased gradually from 0.096 mmol/g (360 °C) until it almost disappeared (Fig. 3b and Figure S4), indicating the newly formed proton is not a Brønsted acid site. Furthermore, compared with the reduced 8Ni-006LiZSM-5, the Lewis acidity of 8NiO-006LiZSM-5 increased from 0.0284 mmol/g to 0.0840 mmol/g at 250 °C and from 0.0181 mmol/g to 0.0621 mmol/g at 360 °C (Fig. 4 b and Figure S5). Inspecting the NH3-TPD curves in Fig. 3a one can conclude that the super acid sites (desorption peak at about 450 °C) were caused by nickel oxide."
9,Enhanced reaction route for the hydrogenation of oleic acid,"3.3 Enhanced reaction route for the hydrogenation of oleic acid 8NiO-006LiZSM-5 was the best catalyst for oleic acid hydrogenation in this study, and the optimization process of the catalyst will be shown in detail in section 3.4. To illustrate the advantages of nickel oxide-supported LiZSM-5 in the preparation of jet fuel from lipids, hydrogenation of oleic acid by 8NiO-006LiZSM-5 and 8Ni-006LiZSM-5 was performed under the same reaction conditions. As shown in Table 1 , the components of jet fuel obtained with 8NiO-006LiZSM-5 as the catalyst can reach 80.42% which is nearly 10% higher than that with 8Ni-006LiZSM-5 by reducing the content of C17-C18. To explain why NiO-LiZSM-5 enhanced the conversion from oleic acid to jet fuel, we studied the reaction routes of 8NiO-006LiZSM-5 and 8Ni-006LiZSM-5 via temperature rising tests. It is well known that the micropore size of ZSM-5 is approximately 0.5 nm, and the particle sizes of nickel or nickel oxide were only distributed on the surface of ZSM-5. This was confirmed by the TEM test on the sliced sample of Ni-LiZSM-5 (Figure S1). Obviously, the NiO/Ni particles could not fill the entire surface of ZSM-5, and the distribution of active sites on the catalyst will not be uniform. Because the carbon-carbon double bond and carboxyl group of oleic acid are the targets for preferential attack by both acid sites and metal centres, the properties of active sites on the catalyst depend on the relative strength between the acid sites and metal centres. As shown in Fig. 6, active distribution B is a schematic diagram of the active sites distribution on the surface of 8Ni-006LiZSM-5. Nickel particles are in the centre of the circle, where the mental centre is the strongest. Along the diametrical direction, the metal centres gradually weaken and the acid sites gradually increase. Because the type and intensity of the active sites change with the position, and the adsorption of the active groups of oleic acid on the catalyst surface is uncertain, oleic acid should have multiple conversion routes. 3.3.1 Basic reaction routes of oleic acid by Ni-LiZSM-5 The product distribution of 8Ni-006LiZSM-5 from 300 °C to 360 °C was basically unchanged (Fig. 5 a). According to the products in Fig. 5a, four main reaction routes exist for the hydrogenation of oleic acid by 8Ni-006LiZSM-5. First, as shown in route 2 of Fig. 6, oleic acid (1) can be saturated by hydrogenation to stearic acid (2), and stearic acid can be further decarbonylated to n-octadecanol (4); if n-octadecanol contacts strong metal centres as S1 (See Active distribution B in Fig. 6), it will continue to hydrogenate to a more stable n-heptadecane (7). Second, n-octadecanol can also be esterified with stearic acid at a suitable active site to form octadecyl stearate (9). Third, if oleic acid contacts an active site like S2, the stearic acid can undergo decarboxylation to n-heptadecane (7) after hydrogenation saturation. According to the product distribution in Fig. 5a, the conversion of oleic acid to n-heptadecane is easier than that to n-octadecane. Fourth, if oleic acid is exposed to strong acid sites like S3, it will crack into small molecules after decarboxylation to olefins. Because no short-chain fatty acid (palmitic acid (7) was confirmed to be an impurity in the substrate) was detected in the rising temperature tests, oleic acid should be decarboxylated and hydrogenated to 8-heptadecene and octadecene first, and then the carbon-carbon double bonds of olefins migrate to form iso-olefins under the action of double-active sites. This could be confirmed by small peaks near n-heptadecane and n-octadecane in Fig. 5a (360 and 360 for 1 h). The mass spectra of the small peaks around n-heptadecane/n-octadecane are similar, and the maximum m/zof the fragments are 238/252 (Figure S2b). The conversion of aromatics from olefins usually need to form a six-membered ring first, and the six-membered ring is then dehydrogenated to form an aromatic. The possible reaction routes are as follows. First, as shown in Eq. 1-Eq. 3, two ethylene molecules can be added to form a dimer containing double bonds under the action of acid sites or metal centres [60,61]. Next, butadiene produced by the dehydrogenation of 1-butene on metal centres reacts with propylene to form 4-ethylcyclohex-1-ene through the Diels-Alder reaction. If 4-ethylcyclohex-1-ene is located near strong metal centres like S1, it will be hydrogenated to ethyl cyclohexane, which was confirmed by the products. If 4-ethylcyclohex-1-ene is located near S2 where the acid site and metal centre coexist, it will first dehydrogenate to form a double bond. Because of its unstable structure, the double bond can migrate easily to the six-membered ring. Additionally, because the structure is still unstable, repeating the above step twice will eventually produce stable ethylbenzene. The conversion routes of other aromatics and naphthenes are similar, and the main difference is the carbon chain length of the olefins added to butadiene. (1) (2) (3) The formation process of iso-paraffins, which is a major component in the products, requires a synergistic effect between metal centres and acid sites. A strong Lewis acid plays a key role during the process, while a small amount of Brønsted acid assists. As shown in Eq. 4, the isomerization of linear olefin is considered as an example. The carbon-carbon double bond of olefin is first attacked by a Brønsted acid proton and forms a carbocation. If the strength of the acid site is insufficient to cause β-cracking, due to its poor stability, the carbocation will convert to allyl carbocation under the action of Lewis acid sites. Under the action of metal centres, the ring of allyl carbocation opens, and then forms iso-alkane after hydrogenation. Due to the migration of the carbon-carbon double bonds and carbocation, the types of iso-alkanes in the products were complex. (4) 3.3.2 Enhanced reaction routes of oleic acid by NiO-LiZSM-5 Although many routes exist for oleic acid conversion, cracking is the necessary route to obtain jet fuel components with a range of C8-C16. Additionally, regarding the strong metal centre, oleic acid is easy to convert into n-heptadecane and n-octadecane, which is not conducive to the conversion of oleic acid to C8-C16. However, the production of both iso-alkanes and aromatics requires the involvement of metal centres. NiO-LiZSM-5 with adjustable active sites could promote the conversion of jet fuel. The nickel oxide loaded on the catalyst in the early stage of the reaction was a strong Lewis acid according to the above analysis of NH3-TPD and the pyridine infrared spectrum. As the reaction proceeded, nickel oxide was gradually reduced to nickel by H2 in the system, and the strong Lewis acid sites caused by NiO would be transformed into metal centres. Comparing Fig. 5a and 5b, the reaction products of 8NiO-006LiZSM-5 and 8Ni-006LiZSM-5 were similar to those of blank experiments (Figure S3) before the reaction temperature was raised to 330 °C, indicating that the active sites of catalysts need to be activated at higher temperatures. However, the product components were obviously different as the temperature continued to rise. Route 1 of Fig. 7 is the reaction route of 8NiO-006LiZSM-5 in the early stage. During this stage, there was no metal centre on the surface of the catalyst. Additionally, nickel oxide, as a strong Lewis acid, enhanced the cracking process, and the content of olefins was higher than that of 8Ni-006LiZSM-5. Due to the strong acid of the catalyst in the early stage, the double bonds of oleic acid migrate and form isomers. As shown in Fig. 5b (360 °C), there are seven small peaks of a-g near oleic acid (1) were evident. The NMR spectra of these small peaks are similar to oleic acid, and the m/zof the maximum fragment were all around 282 (Figure S2c), confirming that they are fatty acids containing eighteen carbons with a similar structure to oleic acid. The rearrangement of double bonds on oleic acid requires the action of acid sites [62], and the reaction was divided into two steps. The oleic acid first obtained a proton from the Brønsted acid site and formed a carbocation (Eq. 5). Next, the other proton is lost under the action of the metal centre (Eq. 6). (5) (6) Because the metal centre was weak in this stage, the long-chain olefins tended to crack at the strong acid sites. As shown in Fig. 6, when the reaction temperature was heated to 360 °C, the content of olefins in the gaseous products was obviously more than that of alkanes: ethylene had 3.7 times greater content than ethane, and propylene was 2.2 times as much as propane. However, the content of olefins catalysed by 8Ni-006LiZSM-5 was lower than that of alkanes. Because olefins are substrates that generate of aromatics and iso-paraffins, this process is a key step to improve the conversion of oleic acid to jet fuel. Additionally, because of the weak metal centre, the esterification product of 8NiO-006LiZSM-5 was octadecyl oleate with a GC peak at 28.3 min, which was different from stearyl stearate with a GC peak at 30.2 min catalysed by 8Ni-006LiZSM-5. Because the reduction temperature of nickel oxide loaded on the surface of LiZSM-5 was approximately 350 °C, the particles of nickel oxide were gradually converted into nickel during the reaction process. Additionally, the active site distribution was changed from A to B (Fig. 7) gradually. As shown in Fig. 6, the relative content of olefins in the gaseous products decreased significantly after the reaction was kept at 360 °C for 1 h, indicating that, after nickel oxide reduction to nickel, the hydrogenation efficiency was greatly improved. Because the reduction of nickel oxide particles requires a certain time, the metal centres should be gradually strengthened. Comparing the products between 8Ni-006LiZSM-5 and 8NiO-006LiZSM-5 after reacting at 360 °C for 1 h, it is obvious that the aromatic content of 8NiO-006LiZSM-5 was significantly higher than it was in 8Ni-006LiZSM-5 (Fig. 5a, 5b). According to the above analysis, olefins are important substrates to form aromatics and iso-paraffins, and NiO-LiZSM-5 enhances the conversion process of oleic acid to jet fuel by producing more olefins during the early stage."
10,Optimization of the reaction conditions,"3.4 Optimization of the reaction conditions As indicated in the above analysis, the novel nickel oxide catalyst with variable active sites has superior performance in the hydrogenation of oleic acid to jet fuel. To obtain the best reaction parameters, the effects of reaction temperature, catalyst dosage, reaction time, hydrogen pressure, and nickel-loading amount on oleic acid conversion were systematically investigated. 3.4.1 Effect of temperature The reaction temperature affects the reduction process of nickel oxide-loaded LiZSM-5, thus affecting the distribution of the active sites of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 2a and 2b, although lithium-promoted ZSM-5 reduced the reduction temperature of nickel oxide particles on the surface of LiZSM-5, the complete reduction temperature of nickel oxide was still more than 330 °C at atmospheric pressure. Additionally, according to the above analysis, the reduction degree of nickel oxide determines the hydrogenation efficiency of the metal centre, which has an important impact on the final product. As shown in Fig. 8 a, before 350 °C, oleic acid could not complete conversion because of the lack of a strong metal centre. With the increase in reaction temperature, the component of C8-C16 in the product increased gradually, mainly because the active sites in catalyst need a high reaction temperature to activate. Considering the energy consumption and manufacturing cost of the reaction equipment, 360 °C was chosen as the optimum reaction temperature. 3.4.2 Effect of the catalyst dosage The number of active sites of catalysts relative to the reaction substrates determines the reaction process. Fig. 8d shows that the content of n-heptadecane and n-octadecane in the reaction products was higher as the catalyst content was low. This was mainly due to the free radical reaction of oleic acid at high temperature. n-Heptadecane and n-octadecane were the main products in blank tests (Figure S3). When the catalyst dosage was low, the colour of the reaction product was darker likely because the free radical reaction produced a large amount of carbon deposition. Additionally, the other components in the product were main oleic acid, stearic acid, and some high-boiling-point components, which were not thoroughly converted. When the catalyst dosage exceeded to 6%, the effective component content of C8-C16 in the product was basically stable. Considering the cost, 6% catalyst addition is the best choice. 3.4.3 Effect of hydrogen pressure The hydrogen pressure reflects the activity of hydrogen molecules. In theory, the higher the hydrogen pressure is, the higher the probability is of hydrogen molecules being adsorbed by the active sites of catalysts. During hydrogenation, the adsorption and activation of hydrogen molecules by the metal centre are vital to achieve the relative reaction. As shown in Fig. 8b, the content of jet fuel in the product increased gradually with the increase in hydrogen pressure. The product components tended to be stable when the hydrogen pressure was increased to 4.5 MPa. Therefore, it is suitable to set the hydrogen pressure to 4.5 MPa. 3.4.4 Effect of the reaction time As shown in Fig. 8c, as the reaction time increased, the other components in the product, such as oleic acid, stearic acid, and n-octadecanol, gradually decreased. Additionally, the effective components of the jet fuel gradually increased. When the reaction lasted longer than 5 h, the conversion of oleic acid was basically stable. 3.4.5 Loaded mass of nickel When the loading dosage of nickel oxide was low, such as 2 wt%, the reaction product was dark brown, indicating that, when the amount of metal centres was insufficient, a large amount of carbon deposits would be produced during the reaction process, greatly reducing the quality of jet fuel. With the increase in nickel loading, the product becomes transparent and yellowish. According to Fig. 8e, nickel loading should be higher than 8 wt% of LiZSM-5."
11,Analysis of products with different catalysts,"3.5 Analysis of products with different catalysts The distribution and relative strength of the acid sites and metal centres of the catalyst determined the final product composition in oleic acid hydrogenation. The nickel-loading dosage of all samples was set to 10 wt% of LiZSM-5. The relative strength between the acid site and metal centre was regulated by adjusting the acidity on ZSM-5. As shown in Fig. 9 , the liquid product consists of n-paraffins, iso-paraffins, cyclo-paraffins and aromatics, as well as incompletely reacted acids, esters, or alcohols with a higher boiling point. Because the reduction temperature of nickel oxide particles loaded on parent HZSM-5 was higher than 431.5 °C (Fig. 2c), they could not be reduced completely and quickly at 360 °C during the reaction process. This caused the content of stearic acid and its derivatives to be close to 30 mol%, which is not in the range of jet fuel. Additionally, the effective components of jet fuel were only 51.65 mol%. Due to the insufficient reaction, the yield of products was approximately 65 mol%, which was higher than the yields of lithium-promoted catalysts. The reaction products catalysed by NiO-xLiZSM-5 (x = 002-008) varied with the regulation of acidity on the catalysts. The amount of C3H8, as the main gaseous product during the cracking process decreased gradually from 1.31 × 10−2 mol to 0.56 × 10-2 mol with the decrease in Brønsted acidity from 0.050 mmol/g to 0.009 mmol/g (Fig. 10 ). It indicates that the reduction of Brønsted acid weakened the cracking process. There are several ways to form methane in this system. 0.6 g of nickel was used as a catalyst to catalyse n-heptadecane in 4 MPa H2 at 360 °C for 5 h. After the reaction, n-heptadecane was completely converted into gaseous products, and the content of methane could reach 88.06 mol%, indicating that the hydrogenolysis of n-alkanes was one of the main reaction routes, and it should occur on strong metal centres. In this system, only 10NiO-010LiZSM-5 had a high production amount of CH4 (1.00 mol), and the others were all less than 0.07 mol. As previously analysed, protons at the Brønsted acid sites of 010LiZSM-5 were completely removed by the complete exchange of lithium ions. As the reaction progressed, NiO particles loaded on 010LiZSM-5 were completely reduced to nickel particles, and the metal centres would be greatly strengthened. Without a strong Brønsted acid, the acid sites were relatively weaker than the metal centres, and the strong metal centre would dominate the reaction process. This finding explains the high production amount of CH4. It is worth noting that, although the Brønsted acidity of 008LiZSM-5 was similar to that of 010LiZSM-5, its CH4 production amount was extremely low. Thus, the acid site activity of the catalysts would be stronger than those of the metal centres in the presence of Brønsted acid, which is a phenomenon that is not associated with the amount of Brønsted acidity. As previously analysed that a strong metal centre would increase the content of long-chain alkanes, the content of C17 and C18 in the liquid product catalysed by 10Ni0-010LiZSM-5 was approximate 25 mol%, which is 2.6 times greater than that of 10NiO-006LiZSM-5. As shown in Fig. 9, the content of effective jet fuel components increased at first and then decreased, also indicating that the appropriate acidity and acid strength are the keys to obtain jet fuel components. In this system, 10NiO-006LiZSM-5 with 0.059 mmol/g of Brønsted acidity and 0.013 mmol/g of Lewis acidity showed the best catalytic activity. When used as a catalyst, the effective components of jet fuel in the product could reach 83.4 mol%. Among them, the contents of iso/cyclo-paraffins and aromatics were 41.4 mol% and 36.9 mol% respectively, and that of the least demanding n-paraffins in jet fuel was only 5.1 mol%."
12,Preparation of bio-jet fuel from waste oils,"3.6 Preparation of bio-jet fuel from waste oils The complexity of the components of waste oils, as well as impurities such as sulphur and heavy metals, may cause catalyst deactivation. To verify the activity of the catalyst for waste oils, four typles of typical waste oils with different acid values were selected as raw materials for hydrogenation in this study. The fatty acid compositions of waste oils are shown in Table 2 , and all contained many C18 fatty acids. However, it is well known that the composition of waste oils varies greatly with the degree of rancidity. In our study, the main components of the waste oils with high acid value, such as No. 1 and No. 4, were fatty acids. And No. 2 and No. 3, with low acid values, have different components. No. 2 oil is a waste oil after esterification, whose main components are fatty acid methyl esters. No. 3 oil is a type of hogwash oil, and its components are mainly triglycerides. All four types of waste oils were converted into jet fuel with a high content after hydrogenation through our catalytic system, indicating that our catalytic system has a wide range of applications for waste oils. Particularly, when using No. 4 as the raw material, the effective content of jet fuel in products can reach 91.7% (Fig. 11 ). The main reason is that No. 4 contains 48.78% palmitic acid, and that content is 2–3 times greater than what is observed in the other samples. Because the carbon number of palmitic acid is in the range of that of jet fuel, it is much easier to convert into jet fuel components than oleic acid. Furthermore, the acid value of waste oil had an obvious influence on the hydrogenation reaction. According to our previous analysis, low aromatics production implied a weakening of cracking, also explaining why the yields of No. 2 and No. 3 were much higher than those of No. 1 and No. 4. As shown in Fig. 12 , more CO was found in the gaseous products of both No. 2 and No. 3, mainly due to the decarbonylation of triglyceride and fatty acid methyl esters. When using No. 1 and No. 4 as the raw material, the content of CO2 in gaseous products was much higher, which was produced by the decarboxylation of fatty acids."
13,Recyclability of catalysts,"3.7 Recyclability of catalysts Due to the irregular morphology of zeolites, it is difficult to uniformly load metal particles on zeolites, a phenomenon that causes inevitable carbon deposition during the reaction process. As shown in Fig. 13 b, the spent catalyst after reaction was covered by carbon deposition, an important reason for catalyst deactivation. Calcination is an economical and effective method to treat carbon deposits on catalysts. As shown in Fig. 13a, the weight loss of the spent catalyst after reaction at 100 °C–250 °C was due to water loss, while the weight loss between 250 °C and 550 °C was due to carbon deposition being oxidized to carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide. Carbon deposition on the catalyst was eliminated after calcination at 550 °C. The thermogravimetric curves also showed that the weight of the refresh catalyst remained stable after 250 °C, confirming that 550 °C was a suitable temperature to remove carbon deposits. Five cycle tests were performed to investigate the recyclability of the catalyst. After each reaction, the spent catalyst was only calcined in air at 550 °C for 3 h to remove carbon deposits. Additionally, no other treatment was performed. According to our previous work, ZSM-5 supported on nickel is very easily inactivated in the hydrogenation of lipids because of the agglomeration and loss of nickel particles, and it could hardly be reused [63]. However, the novel catalyst designed in this study greatly improved the cyclic performance of these catalysts. According to previous reports, the interaction between the completely reduced metal particles and carrier was weak, while the oxidized metal particles were bonded to the carrier through oxygen atoms, enhancing the interaction between them [64–66]. In this study, driven by the high speed of a mechanical agitator, mechanical wear among solid particles or between solid particles and agitator was inevitable, leading to the loss of metal particles. As shown in Fig. 14 , after five cycles, the nickel content of the catalyst decreased from 8% to approximately 5%. Due to the loss of metal centres, the content of C17-C18 in the liquid product increased with the increase in the number of cycles. However, if it is used in a continuous reactor with fixed catalysts, we believe that this situation can be greatly improved. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 13c, except for the decrease in super acidity caused by the loss of nickel oxide, the other acid sites on the catalyst did not change significantly after the reaction, providing a possibility to restore the catalyst activity by re-loading nickel oxide."
14,Conclusion,"A series of novel nickel oxide-loaded LiZSM-5 catalysts with variable active sites was prepared and characterized. Lithium ions exchange and NiO loading of the parent HZSM-5 were used to regulate the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. As a strong Lewis acid site, nickel oxide markly enhanced the Lewis acid of the catalyst greatly. After treatment with a low concentration of lithium hydroxide alkali solution (0.02M-0.10 M), the Brønsted protons were partially replaced, and the Brønsted acidity decreased from 0.096 mmol/g (360 °C) gradually until it almost disappeared. With reduction of the acidity, the content of jet fuel was increased first and then was reduced. 10NiO-006LiZSM-5 with 0.059 mmol/g of Brønsted acidity and 0.013 mmol/g of Lewis acidity showed the best catalytic activity, and the content of jet fuel components could reach 83.4 mol%. According to analysis of the temperature rising tests between 8NiO-006LiZSM-5 and 8Ni-006LiZSM-5, the novel catalysts promoted the conversion of lipids to jet fuel components by producing more olefins. Furthermore, four substrate waste oils with different components and acid values were used to study the catalytic performance of the catalysts. NiO-LiZSM-5 has good catalytic activity on all four waste oils. The novel catalyst with variable active sites was fully confirmed to be a superior catalyst to the prepare jet fuel from waste oils."
