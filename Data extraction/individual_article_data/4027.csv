0,Introduction,"As noted in many articles written about fossil fuel resources, we are facing serious challenges over the next decades concerning the reduction of these non-renewable resources, increasing the global need for energy and environmental issues associated with global warming. Therefore, in recent years, a significant area of research has devoted to seek the new sustainable sources of energy and chemicals [1–5]. Based on the review of current research, biomass seems to be a good substitute for fossil fuel resources because this renewable source is not only cheap, abundant and accessible, but also dissolves the difficulty of agricultural waste use. Alternatively, biomass is unparalleled in providing the only concentrated source of fixed carbon which can produce liquid transport fuel and valuable chemicals with a minimum amount of environmental impacts [6–9]. Among different high-value organic chemicals derived from biomass, special recent attention has been dedicated to levulinate esters owing to their many applications in industry, including production of diesel fuels, resins, cancer therapeutics, herbicides, fragrances, and so on [10–17]. One of the potential routes for the production of levulinate esters from biomass resources is alcoholysis of cellulosic biomass-derived furfuryl alcohol (Fig. 1 ). This reaction was carried out in the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous acid catalysts [18,19]. However, most of the researchers prefer to use heterogeneous acid catalysts to avoid corrosion of the instruments, pollution problems and the troubles related to separation and recovery of the products [20–22]. Hence, in the last decade, a variety of heterogeneous acid catalysts, such as functionalized organosilica nanotubes (ArSO3H-Si(Et)Si-Ph-NTs) [23], heteropoly acids (i.e., H5AlW12O40) and POM-based ionic liquids (i.e., [MIMBS]5[AlW12O40]) [24], zeolites (i.e., Fe/USY, hierarchical H-ZSM-5) [25,26], sulfated zirconia (SZ) [27], metal salts [28], SO4 −2/TiO2 [29] Titanium exchanged heteropoly tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) and porous aluminosilicate (Al-TUD-1) have been reported for production of levulinate esters from furfuryl alcohol [30,31]. Although, the efficiency of these catalysts has affirmed in furfuryl alcohol alcoholysis, most of them are plagued with arduous preparation procedures, high cost and difficult recovery. To improve these problems, some silica mesoporous materials have been investigated as effective supports to synthesize heterogeneous acid catalysts. Thus, many researchers have studied the catalytic activity of modified mesoporous silica for production of alkyl levulinates from furfuryl alcohol. For example, Enumula et al. used Al2O3-SBA-15 as a catalyst for this reaction. They produced n-butyl levulinate with 94% selectivity at 110 °C after 6 [32]. Sankar et al. synthesized n-butyl levulinate over SBA-16 supported tungstophosphoric acid catalyst with 97% selectivity at 110 °C after 3 h [33]. Appaturi et al. prepared mesoporous Ti-KIT-6 and used in the reaction of furfuryl alcohol and butanol. The selectivity of n-butyl levulinate was 100% at 110 °C after 5 h [34]. Among mesoporous silica, dendritic fibrous nanosilica possesses more unique properties relative to other popular silica supports. For instance, in comparison to SBA-15 and MCM-41, the active sites of DFNS are available from all directions due to its special fibrous morphology. This feature and its adjustable pore size and pore volume increase the loading of modifier molecules (e.g., metals, organic molecules, metal oxides, inorganic complexes and so on) onto the surface of silica support. Moreover, this environmentally friendly non-toxic silica has good mechanical, chemical, and thermal stability compered to known mesoporous materials [35,36]. Regarding these good features, it seems that DFNS can be a good candidate to synthesize an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for production of alkyl levulinates. Up to now, our group has applied various kinds of functionalized mesoporous silica in some biomass conversions, including production of n-butyl levulinate from levulinic acid, conversion of fructose to ethyl levulinate, dehydration of glucose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and so on [21,37–40]. According to the results of our previous works, we concluded that these reactions were effectively carried out in the presence of functionalized mesoporous silica. In this context, we prepared a novel bi-functional heterogeneous acid catalyst using DFNS as an efficient support and investigated the effect of the simultaneous presence of two acidic functions on the catalytic performance of this catalyst in the reaction of furfuryl alcohol and n-hexanol for the first time. For this purpose, surface modification was carried out in two steps: direct synthesis of Al/DFNS with different Si/Al molar ratios and synthesis of Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H by a post-grafting method. Then this catalyst was applied in the reaction of furfuryl alcohol and n-hexanol and effect of different parameters on the yield of n-hexyl levulinate was assayed. Catalyst reusability was also investigated."

3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The preparation method of Al/DFNS with n Si/n Al ratios of 5, 20 and 40 was the same as those presented by Shahangi et al. [39]. To summarize, 1 g of CTAB, 0.6 g of urea and the defined amount of aluminum isopropoxide as the Al source (0.49, 0.122, and 0.0612 g for 5Al/DFNS, 20Al/DFNS, and 40Al/DFNS, respectively) were added to deionized water. After stirring for 3 h at 25 °C, this solution was added to 2.5 g TEOS, 1.5 mL pentanol and 30 mL cyclohexane and the mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The resultant mixture was refluxed with constant stirring for 4 h in an oil bath at 120 °C and then transferred to an oven for 24 h at 80 °C. After cooling, the obtained Al/DFNS particles were separated by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min and washed six times with deionized water and acetone. Then these particles were dried for 24 h and calcined at 550 °C in air for six hours. Afterward, the resulting solids including 5Al/DFNS, 20Al/DFNS, and 40Al/DFNS were post-grafted with sulfonic acid groups according to a previously reported method [40]. For this purpose, the mixture of 30 mL anhydrous toluene, 1 mL mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane and 1 g of synthesized xAl/DFNS (where x indicates Si/Al molar ratio in the synthesis mixture) was refluxed at 120 °C for 24 to grafting thiol groups on the surface of silica material. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled, filtered and washed in a Soxhlet extractor with ethanol for 24 h. After thorough drying, the synthesized xAl/DFNS/Pr-SH particles were added to 30 mL hydrogen peroxide (30%) and stirred for 24 h to synthesize bifunctional xAl/DFNS/Pr-SO3H catalysts. Finally, the resulting samples were washed three times with methanol and dried at 25 °C."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis was carried out using a PHS-1020 (PHS CHINA) instrument at 77 K. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a HITACHI S-4160 microscope. High angle powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was recorded on an Asenware XDM-300 diffractometer, equipped with Ni-filtered Cu K α(K = 0.15406 nm) radiation. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted with a TG 209F1 analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere. An inductively coupled plasma (ICP) Spectrometer (GBC INTEGRA XL, Australia) was used to measure the Al content of the samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired on a Philips CN120 apparatus. Elemental mapping and EDX (energy dispersive X-ray) analysis were done on a VEGA–TESCAN–LMU microscope. FT-IR spectra on KBr disks of the samples were recorded using a JASCO FT/IR-680 PLUS spectrometer. Pyridine adsorption analysis was used to study the acidic sites of the samples. In the pyridine adsorption procedure, the sample disk was made and heated at 120 °C for 24 h to eliminate the physically adsorbed water molecules. After cooling to room temperature, the FTIR spectrum of the sample was recorded. Then, the sample disk was exposed to a very small amount of pyridine and placed at room temperature for 24 h. In order to remove unbound pyridine, the sample disk was evacuated at 120 °C for 3 h and a corresponding FTIR spectrum was recorded. The quantity of acid sites was calculated using the Emeis equations [41]. The Bronsted acidity of the samples (–SO3H groups) was measured by back titration: the sample (0.01 g) was added to 3 mL of 0.01 M NaOH solution. The resulting mixture was stirred for 10 min at c 0.01 M HCl [42]."
5,Catalytic performance and quantification of the products,"2.4 Catalytic performance and quantification of the products In order to evaluate the catalytic performance of Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H (Si/Al = 5, 20 and 40), conversion of furfuryl alcohol into n-hexyl levulinate was carried out using these catalysts. For this purpose, the catalyst (0.02–0.08 g), furfuryl alcohol (0.1–0.7 mL) and 3 mL of n-hexanol were added into a 10 mL round-bottom flask. The mixture was stirred (1000 rpm) and heated at reflux for a period of time (1–6 h) at specified temperature (110–150 °C). At the end of the reaction, the mixture was cooled down and the liquid phase of the mixture was separated by centrifugation (10 min, 6000 rpm). Then the analysis of the liquid phase was performed using a GC (Teifgostar Faraz, GC-2552) with a SPBTM-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 lm film thickness) and a flame ionization (FID) detector. The amounts of the products and reactant were calculated according to GC results and calibration curves using biphenyl as internal standard. Hexyl l e v u l i n a t e y i e l d % = Amount o f h e x y l l e v u l i n a t e Amount o f f u r f u r y l a l c o h o l × 100 furfuryl a l c o h o l c o n v e r s i o n % = Amount o f p r i m a r y F A - a m o u n t o f f i n a l F A Amount o f p r i m a r y F A × 100 The above equations were used to obtain nHL yield and conversion of furfuryl alcohol. Notably, the identity of produced n-hexyl levulinate was confirmed by GC–MS, (Agilent, 5975C) with a HP5 capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm ID, BPX5 0.25 lm)."
6,Recycling of the catalyst and leaching test,"2.5 Recycling of the catalyst and leaching test The recycling of the catalyst and leaching test were performed under the optimum reaction conditions by using the procedure mentioned in Section 2.4. For reusability of the catalyst, the solid acid particles were separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation (10 min, 6000 rpm) and washed with acetone. Then the catalyst was placed in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h and reused. For leaching test, the reaction mixture was carried out under the optimum reaction conditions for 30 min. Then the solid acid catalyst was filtered and the filtrate was kept at optimum temperature for another 3 h 30 min. Then the filtrate was examined by GC both after 30 min and at the end of the leaching test (4 h). Simultaneously, another reaction was performed under the same reaction conditions without separating the catalyst from the reaction mixture and the results of these two reactions were compered [43]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization In order to evaluate the properties of synthesized catalysts and the effects of modification on the nature of DFNS, the samples were investigated by following methods: 3.1.1 FTIR analysis The FTIR spectra of DFNS, Al/DFNS and Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H samples are displayed in Fig. 2 . For the bare DFNS sample, a broad adsorption band about 3432 cm−1 is ascribed to O–H stretching vibration and the bending vibration of the adsorbed water molecules on the silica surface is observed at 1635 cm−1. A drastic band at 1098 is due to unsymmetrical stretching vibrations of Si–O–Si and the bands at 469 cm−1 and 810 cm−1 are attributed to bending and symmetrical stretching vibrations of Si–O–Si, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the peaks defined above are observed on the FT-IR spectra of all samples with no visibly shift in peaks position. These results confirm that the original framework of DFNS has remained unchanged after modification. For Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H samples, the extra band at 2940 cm−1 is related to C–H stretching vibration, indicating the presence of mercaptopropyl groups on the surface of DFNS. 3.1.2 XRD analysis In order to determine the crystalline forms of Al2O3, Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H samples were characterized by wide angle powder x-ray diffraction (Fig. 3 ). According to obtained diffraction patterns, no peak corresponding to crystalline forms of Al2O3 is observed and all the samples show only a broad peak due to the presence of amorphous silica. These results indicate that Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H samples contain the amorphous form of Al2O3. 3.1.3 ICP and BET analysis The accurate Si/Al ratios of Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H samples, defined by ICP, are presented in Table 1 . Although the Si/Al ratios of the samples in the synthesis mixture are slightly less than those in the final materials, the results indicate that the aluminum atoms were almost completely incorporated into the DFNS structure. In Fig. 4 , the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of DFNS and Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H samples are exhibited. All the samples show IV isotherms with hysteresis due to their mesoporous nature. Also, their surface properties are listed in Table 1. The gradual decrease in the textural parameters with a decrease in the Si/Al ratio is an evidence for successful modification of DFNS structure. 3.1.4 SEM analysis, EDX spectrum and elemental mapping The results of Scanning electron microscopy analysis are displayed in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5b shows that the spherical shape of DFNS particles (Fig. 5a) hasn't changed after modification. Fig. 6 shows the EDX spectrum and elemental mapping of 40Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H sample. As expected, EDX spectrum indicate that 40Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H sample is composed of Si, O and Al elements. Also, elemental mapping of this sample reveals the uniform distribution of Al on the surface of DFNS. 3.1.5 TEM analysis Transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 7 ) was used to investigate the effect of modification on the morphological properties of 40Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H sample. Fig. 7b shows that the sample is composed of nanospheres with dendritic fibrous morphologies. Comparison of this image with Fig. 7a shows that the original morphology of DFNS has been well preserved after modification. 3.1.6 Acidity and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) Pyridine adsorption FT-IR spectroscopy was used to study the acidity of the samples. As shown in Fig. 8 , five significant peaks are observed on the pyridine FT-IR spectra of the Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H samples. The two peaks at 1545 cm−1 and 1638 cm−1 are assigned to adsorbed pyridine on Brønsted acid sites and the peak at 1446 cm−1 is attributed to pyridine coordinated to Lewis acid sites. The sharp peak at 1489 cm−1 is due to the co-existence of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites and the additional peak at 1597 cm−1 is the result of pyridine hydrogen-bonded to surface hydroxyl groups [44]. According to the integrated area of the peaks corresponding to Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, the concentrations of these sites were calculated (Table 2 ). The results indicate that, the total acidity of the samples increases with decreasing the Si/Al ratio. It implies that incorporation of aluminum in to the DFNS structure develops the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites of the surface. On the contrary, the results of titration show that the number of Brønsted acid sites decreases with decreasing the Si/Al ratio (Table 2). These results indicate that incorporation of more aluminum decreases the number of grafted propylsulfonic acid groups due to the lower amount of available silanol groups on the surface of DFNS [45]. This effect can be confirmed by TGA analysis. The percentage loading of grafted organic compounds on DFNS was estimated from TGA curves of the samples (Fig. 9 ). 5Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H sample shows a lower weight loss (12.6%) compared with 20Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H (30.7%) and 40 Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H (32.2%). These results affirm that the amount of grafted organic compounds of 5 Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H sample is much lower due to the effect of Al loading. In addition, as presented in Table 2, the H+ content obtained by thermogravimetric analysis are higher than those calculated by titration. This observation implies that all the grafted groups on the surface of DFNS are not in the form of propylsulfonic acid groups. It means that all the thiol groups grafted on the surface have not been completely oxidized."
9,Investigation of catalytic activity,"3.2 Investigation of catalytic activity In order to investigate the catalytic activity, synthesized catalysts were used in the reaction of furfuryl alcohol with n-hexanol. As displayed in Fig. 10 , the alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol in the presence of 5Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H, 20Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H and 40Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H catalysts results corresponding nHL with selectivity’s 16.7, 23.9 and 37.8% respectively with more than 90% conversion of furfuryl alcohol in each case without any optimization. It is observed that selectivity to nHL increases with increasing the Si/Al ratio. These results can be related to the acidity of the catalysts (Table 2), since the higher acidity of the catalyst (in the case of 5Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H and 20Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H) leads to the more production of byproducts. On the other hand, GC–MS results show the existence of an intermediate (hexoxymethylfuran) in this reaction. Thus, furfuryl alcohol is converted to nHL in two steps: conversion of furfuryl alcohol to hexoxymethylfuran as an intermediate and then conversion of hexoxymethylfuran to n-hexyl levulinate (Scheme 1 ). A closer look at Fig. 10 discloses that selectivity to hexoxymethylfuran also increases with increasing the Si/Al ratio. In addition, the selectivity to hexoxymethylfuran in the presence of 5Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H catalyst with the highest acidity is lower than those in the presence of other catalysts. This observation indicates that furfuryl alcohol was converted to oligomeric byproducts under high acidic conditions [26]. Based on the above results, 40Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H was preferred to optimize the reaction conditions. 3.2.1 Optimization of reaction conditions 3.2.1.1 Reaction time As a first step in optimizing the reaction conditions, conversion of furfuryl alcohol to nHL was carried out at various reaction times (Fig. 11 ). The results show that nHL yield and furfuryl alcohol conversion gradually increase with increasing the reaction time from 1 to 4 h. However, with increasing the reaction time from 4 to 6 h, furfuryl alcohol conversion increases insignificantly, while nHL yield gradually decreases which may be attributed to the fact that the reaction has reached equilibrium at 4 h [26]. Therefor, 4 h was selected as the optimum reaction time. 3.2.1.2 Reaction temperature Optimizing the reaction temperature was the next step in optimization of reaction conditions. To achieve this purpose, alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol with n-hexanol was performed at various temperatures in the range of 110 to 150 °C. As displayed in Fig. 12 , increasing the reaction temperature from 110 to 140 °C, leads to maximum yield of product (66.3%) with high conversion of furfuryl alcohol (98%). Moreover, the yield of nHL decreases with further increase of the reaction temperature to 150 °C. It may be related to side reactions of nHL under higher temperatures [28]. As a result, 140 °C was chosen as the proper reaction temperature. 3.2.1.3 Furfuryl alcohol amount After optimizing the reaction time and temperature, production of nHL was examined by varying the furfuryl alcohol volume from 0.1 to 0.7 mL to achieve optimum amount. Based on the results is presented in Fig. 13 , with increasing the furfuryl alcohol volume from 0.1 to 0.4 mL, n-hexyl levulinate yield increases from 39.4 to 76.4%. However, when the furfuryl alcohol volume increases up to 0.4 mL the yield of nHL decreases because furfuryl alcohol is polymerized to oligomeric products at higher concentrations [33]. Thus, the highest yield of nHL with 98% conversion of furfuryl alcohol was attained with a volume of 0.4 mL of furfuryl alcohol. 3.2.1.4 Catalyst weight Finally, the catalyst weight was optimized in the esterification reaction. Fig. 14 shows the results of the corresponding experiments. In general, nHL yield increases with increasing the catalyst weight due to the increase of catalytically active sites. It seems that when the catalyst weight is 0.06 g, the catalytically active sites of the catalyst are sufficient to attain the highest yield of nHL (93.5%) with 99.5% conversion of FA. In addition, increasing of catalyst weight up to 0.07 g shows insignificant change in the yield of nHL. 3.2.2 Catalytic performance of prepared catalysts under optimum reaction conditions Alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol was carried out in the presence of prepared catalysts under optimum reaction conditions to investigate their catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 15 , this reaction is not carried out without any catalyst. Similarly, no conversion of furfuryl alcohol is performed in the presence of DFNS. For all catalysts, even for those with lower acidity, the values of FA conversion were obtained more than 80%. However, the yields of nHL were different. This perception implies that the conversion of hexoxymethylfuran to nHL is more difficult than conversion of furfuryl alcohol to hexoxymethylfuran. nHL yield of 37.7, 25.1, 17.9, and 10.4% was acquired for DFNS/Pr-SO3H, 5Al/DFNS, 20Al/DFNS, and 40Al/DFNS, respectively. These results indicate that the acidity of these catalysts isn't enough to convert hexoxymethylfuran to nHL effectively. With further modification, the yield of product was reached to 61.7, 73, and 93.5% for the 5Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H, 20Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H, and 40Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H, respectively. Thus, the acidity of the catalyst has the crucial role in this reaction. Notably, the reason of inverse results for the yield of nHL in the presence of 5Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H and 20Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H was discussed in Section 3.2. After investigation of catalytic activity of prepared catalysts, the synergistic impact of Lewis and Brønsted acidic sties of the catalyst was studied. For this purpose, the reaction was carried out in the simultaneous presence of 40Al/DFNS (0.03 g) and DFNS/Pr-SO3H (0.03 g) under optimum reaction conditions. According to the result of this experiment, the yield of nHL (56.3%) was much lower than that observed for 40Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H catalyst. It implies that the synergistic impact of Lewis and Brønsted acidic sties of 40Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H provides the high catalytic activity for this catalyst. Based on these results, the mechanism of catalytic activity of 40Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H in the reaction of furfuryl alcohol and n-hexanol was proposed. As shown in Fig. 16 , it seems that adsorption of furfuryl alcohol take places on the Lewis and Brønsted acidic sties of the catalyst and the reaction rapidly progresses due to the synergistic impact of these acidic sties. 3.2.2.1 3.2.2.1. Catalytic performance of reported catalysts Based on our search in literature, synthesis of n-hexyl levulinate using heterogeneous catalysts has been restricted to a handful of studies. Among them, there is only one research about conversion of furfuryl alcohol to n-hexyl levulinate. In this study, Zhu et al. investigated the catalytic performance of graphene oxide in the reaction of furfuryl alcohol with n-hexanol. The yield of n-hexyl levulinate was 87% at 120 °C after 6 h. In addition, the amount of this catalyst used in this reaction was 0.1 g [46]. Hence, in terms of catalyst amount, reaction time and product yield, 40Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H catalyst is better than graphene oxide catalyst in this reaction."
10,Leaching test,"3.3 Leaching test One of the substantial topics about using of heterogeneous catalysts is the leaching of active sites from the catalyst to the solution. To investigate this matter, twin reactions were carried out under optimum conditions. After 30 min, the catalyst was removed from one of the reactions. At this point, the values of furfuryl alcohol conversion and nHL yield were 99% and 5% respectively. It demonstrates that the first step of the reaction has been completely performed and furfuryl alcohol has converted to hexoxymethylfuran. Then, the resulting solution was placed in the reaction again. At the end of the reaction, the yield of n-hexyl levulinate was about 6% while this value was 93.5% for the reaction in which the catalyst has not been removed. It was found that only a small amount of active sites of the catalyst was leached from the catalyst."
11,Reusability,"3.4 Reusability In order to evaluate the reusability of 40Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H catalyst, the reaction of furfuryl alcohol with n-hexanol was repeated four times by applying the procedure mentioned in Section 2.5. The results of these experiments are displayed in Fig. 17 . According to these results, the yield of n-hexyl levulinate decrease from 93.5% to 85.7% at the end of the fourth use while the conversion of furfuryl alcohol is unchanged. This insignificant decrease in the yield of n-hexyl levulinate is probably due to the adsorbed oligomeric byproducts on the catalyst surface [23]."
12,Conclusion,"In this work, Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H catalysts with different Si/Al molar ratios were prepared using dendritic fibrous nanosilica (DFNS) as an efficient support. Characterization of these catalysts demonstrated that the original framework of DFNS has not changed after modification. The results of Py-FTIR, TGA and titration methods revealed the high acidity of synthesized catalysts and showed that the modification approach was successfully performed due to special morphology of DFNS. The catalytic performance of these catalysts were investigated in the synthesis of n-hexyl levulinate from alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol with n-hexanol and a high yield of nHL of 93.5% was obtained in the presence of 40Al/DFNS/Pr-SO3H catalyst under optimum reaction conditions (140 °C, 4 h). Moreover, leaching test of the catalyst confirmed the heterogeneous quiddity of the catalyst and the catalyst was reusable for four cycles, showing a small decrease in nHL yield."
