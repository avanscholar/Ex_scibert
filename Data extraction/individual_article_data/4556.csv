0,Introduction,"Increasing utilization of fossil fuels accompanied by energy crisis and environmental concerns has led to exploration of clean and renewable energy sources [1]. In terms of continuous energy supply and environmental sustainability, hydrogen production by photocatalysis under sunlight is recognized as an alternative and renewable energy source to replace fossil fuels [2]. Since, the pioneer work of water splitting by Honda-Fujishima in 1972, researchers are working on designing efficient semiconductor photocatalysts for selective hydrogen production [3]. However, most of the photocatalyst semiconductors mainly absorb UV light irradiations owing to their wider band gap and show low efficiency towards H2 production [4]. Another cause of lower efficiency is due to the slow surface reactions for efficient consumption of hot charge carriers [5]. Rate of H2 production can be increased by utilizing sacrificial agents and/or hole scavengers that aid photocatalytic activity to increase H2 production [6,7]. Among the semiconductors, TiO2 has been widely investigated because of its high chemical/thermal stability, high oxidation potential and non-toxicity [8,9]. However, TiO2 shows lower absorption of visible light due to wide band gap energy (3.2 eV) causing low hydrogen yield. Additionally, rapid charge carrier recombination at TiO2 surface or in the bulk slows kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction [10]. The photoactivity of TiO2 can be improved through several methods such as adding scavenger (to contribute additional electron donor), addition of carbonate salts, dye sensitization, fabrication by binary composites and heterojunction formation to improve charge carrier separation for boosting surface redox reactions [11]. In this perspective, Co decorated TiO2 nanorods by photo-deposition method have been studied to improve photocatalytic H2 production [12]. Similarly, pCN/TiO2 [13], CNQDs/TiO2 [14], Cu(OH)2–TiO2 nanocomposite [15], 1D GO QDs/TiO2 [16] and other photocatalysts have been investigated with enhanced H2 evolution rate. Thus, development of high efficient, low cost and environmental friendly photocatalysts and discovery of factors involved in the process have become major research hotspot in the photocatalytic field. Recently, nickel phosphide (Ni2P) has been recognized as a low cost and long-lasting cocatalyst for H2 evolution. It shows exceptional physicochemical properties including electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity [17]. Moreover, Ni2P has been used as a co-catalyst for enhanced photocatalytic reactions due to its proficient electron trapping and transfer characteristics and due to bi-functional active sites, which act as noble metals to get superior electron conductive properties [18,19]. In addition, low onset potential of Ni2P, good stability and activity is beneficial for promoting photocatalytic H2 evolution rate [20]. In this perspective, hybrid 0D/2D Ni2P quantum dots loaded TiO2 nanosheets with enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light has been reported. The photoactivity of TiO2 was increased by 15 folds with Ni2P cocatalyst due to act as the electron acceptor and captured electrons from TiO2 [21]. Similarly, Wu et al. [22] reported composite of CdS@TiO2/Ni2P with enhanced hydrogen production and photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue with Ni2P acting as an electron trap. In another development, Song et al. [23] discussed TiO2/Ni2P as an excellent hydrogen evolution catalyst due to enhanced charge transportation properties. Moreover, transition metal phosphides including Ni2P [24], FeP [25], MoP [26] and Cu3P [27] are also under consideration as co-catalysts to maximize H2 evolution rate. Though, H2 generation mechanism for Ni2P as a metal phosphide co-catalyst is not yet fully understood, but coupling this co-catalyst with various semiconductors to achieve efficient H2 generation remains a worthwhile venture because of the remarkable feature of Ni2P for hydrogen generation compared to other phosphides. In the current development, much research has been focused on the fabrication of structured photocatalysts with higher efficiency and selectivity. In this context, Ti3AlC2 has been researched as a layered ternary carbide two-dimensional (2D) material belonging to the MAX phase, where M is early transition elements, A is an A group element and X is C, N showing extraordinary ability to be utilized in the modification of less efficient photocatalyst for improvement of their efficiency. The n can be 1, 2, 3 referring to 211, 312 and 413 phases of MAX, respectively. They constitute crystal structure with alternative stacking of edge-shared Ti6C octahedra and two dimensional close-packed Al plane having three Ti-layers stacked by every Al-plane [28]. MAX phases have characteristics of both metals and ceramics, exhibiting both ceramic and metallic properties and resulting in captivating properties such as resistance to thermal shock, corrosion resistant, noble machinability, high electrical conductivity and ultra-low friction [29,30]. Due to the exceptional electronic structure and larger exposed surface area of MAX phase, Ti3AlC2 is capable for energy, electronic applications and photocatalytic applications [31]. MAX phase solids are not only limited to energy and electronic application, but can be involved in other applications by making use of their metallic properties, stability at high-temperature, and superior mechanical properties [32]. Significant work has been conducted on photocatalytic application by etching of Ti3AlC2 into Ti3C2, however, there is insignificant work conducted on utilizing Ti3AlC2 MAX phase solids in photocatalytic applications. Only MAX phase Ti3AlC2 is reported for CO2 reduction through methane bio-reforming, but still no research has been carried out on photocatalytic H2 production [33]. Thus, Ti3AlC2 is expected to develop new reaction pathways that are not available in traditional catalyst [34]. Decorating Ti3AlC2 MAX structure with TiO2 NPs would be fruitful to improve dispersion with superior charge carrier separation and transportation. Similarly, Ni2P as a cocatalyst with Ti3AlC2/TiO2 would develop heterojunction to provide charge separation and redox potential for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production. MAX phase Ti3AlC2 would provide significant electronic properties towards photocatalytic H2 production based on its layered structure, which facilitates efficient charge separation [31]. There are limited reports available on utilizing TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 heterojunction composite for hydrogen production. Thus, it is anticipated that heterojunction of TiO2/Ni2P dispersed onto 2D Ti3AlC2 nanosheets would enable minimizing charge carrier recombination to maximize H2 production. Herein, design and fabrication of two dimensional Ti3AlC2 MAX dispersed TiO2/Ni2P heterojunction for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light has been investigated. The exfoliated Ti3AlC2 multilayers with TiO2 growth was fabricated through sonicated assisted hydrothermal approach, however, composite of Ti3AlC2/Ni2P/TiO2 was obtained through modified sol-gel method. The performance of photocatalyst was conducted in a slurry photoreactor system under visible light for photocatalytic H2 production. The role of Ni2P loading and interaction of Ti3AlC2/TiO2 composite was systematically investigated. The effect of parameters such as catalyst loading, different sacrificial reagents and irradiation time were further disclosed. The role of sacrificial reagent as holes scavenger and its contribution in reforming reaction was further investigated by analysing gas products other than H2 such as CO2 and CH4 through online gas chromatograph. The stability of the samples was investigated for H2 production on the basis of cyclic runs for H2 production. The fundamental cause for increased H2 production over Ti3AlC2 dispersed TiO2/Ni2P heterojunction has been further investigated by developing reaction mechanism based on experimental results."
1,Experimental,"Titanium (IV) Isopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%), Iso-propanol (Emsure, 60.1 g/mol), Acetic acid (QRec, 60.05 g/mol), Titanium aluminum carbide (Sigma-Aldrich, 194.60 g/mol), Nickel phosphide (Sigma-Aldrich, 148.3 g/mol) and Ethanol (ORec, 46.07 g/mol) were all analytically pure reagents and were utilized in catalyst synthesis without additional purification. Titanium aluminum carbide with ≥99% purity and 40–60 μm particle size and nickel phosphide with 98% purity and ∼100 mesh particle size were commercially purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used for preparation of Ni2P loaded TiO2, TiO2 dispersion over Ti3AlC2 and Ni2P/TiO2 dispersed Ti3AlC2 composite samples."
2,Synthesis of TiO2 and Ni2P/TiO2,"2.1 Synthesis of TiO2 and Ni2P/TiO2 Sol-gel single step method was used to prepare TiO2 nanoparticles in which the precursory of titanium solution was prepared with molar ratios Ti(C4H9O)4:15C2H5OH:2CH3COOH (1 M). Typically, 10 mL titanium tetraisopropoxide was dissolved in 30 mL isopropanol with stirring for 30 min. To initiate controlled hydrolysis, a solution of 6 mL acetic acid (1 M) and 10 mL isopropanol was prepared by stirring for 30 min and added dropwise to the titanium solution under vigorous stirring. The sol obtained was continuously stirred for next 24 h at 30 οC and then dried in oven at 80οC for 12 h followed by calcination at 500 οC for 2 h. The Ni2P/TiO2 composite was also prepared using the sol-gel method as discussed above. Specific amount of commercially purchased Ni2P dispersed in isopropanol was added into the titanium solution after stirring for 24 h. The mixture was stirred for another 6 h before drying in oven at 80 °C for 12 and finally calcined at 500 °C for 2 h. The sample obtained was grinded into fine powder and named as TiO2/Ni2P composite. The different amounts of Ni2P loading (1, 3 and 5 wt %) were synthesized using the same procedure and named as 1% Ni2P/TiO2, 3% Ni2P/TiO2 and 5% Ni2P/TiO2 composite samples."
3,Synthesis of TiO2/Ti3AlC2,"2.2 Synthesis of TiO2/Ti3AlC2 For synthesis of TiO2/Ti3AlC2, commercially available titanium aluminium carbide was utilized. Firstly, pristine Ti3AlC2 was calcined in a furnace at 500 °C for the growth of TiO2 NPs. However, for the synthesis of Ti3AlC2/TiO2 composite, sol-gel method was employed. First, the precursory of the titanium solution was prepared as explained above. Similar to Ni2P/TiO2 preparation, after stirring of titanium solution for 24 h at 30 °C, the commercially prepared 25% Ti3AlC2 dispersed in isopropanol was added dropwise to the titanium solution. The sample was further stirred for another 6 h and oven dried at 80 °C for 12 h followed by calcination at 500 °C for 2 h. The sample was further grinded to fine powder and named as Ti3AlC2/TiO2 composite."
4,Synthesis of TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite,"2.3 Synthesis of TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite The composite TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 was prepared by deposition of prepared TiO2 by sol-gel method and Ni2P nanoparticles onto Ti3AlC2 using commercially available titanium aluminium carbide and nickel phosphide. Consequently, when the precursory of titanium solution was synthesized, the commercially prepared 25% Ti3AlC2 and 3% Ni2P were separately dispersed in isopropanol for 3 h. Firstly, the dispersed Ti3AlC2 was added drop-wise to titanium solution followed by stirring for 6 h. Likewise, the dispersed Ni2P was added dropwise and stirred for another 6 h. The solution was ultrasonically dispersed for 1 h for better dispersion of TiO2/Ni2P onto Ti3AlC2. Then, drying was carried out at 80 °C for 24 h followed by calcination at 500 °C for 2 h. The product obtained was grinded into fine powder and named as TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite catalyst. The schematic illustration for the synthesis of TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite has been demonstrated in Fig. 1 ."
5,Characterization of materials,"2.4 Characterization of materials XRD analysis was conducted using Rigaku Smart Lab-Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm) operating at 40 kV and 30 mA for analyzing the crystalline structure of the catalysts. Scanning range 10–80° of 2θ and scanning rate of 8.2551° min−1 were utilized for obtaining XRD patterns. FESEM, ZEISS Crossbeam 340 was used to examine the surface morphology and EDX mapping for the catalyst samples. The morphology was further examined using high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) with the help of HITACHI HT7700 machine. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Ultra DLD Shimadzu) was employed for analyzing elemental state of the surface components. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) were recorded with a UV-3600 Plus series spectrometer between 220 and 800 nm ultraviolet–vis (UV–vis) diffuse reflectance absorbance spectra of the samples. The band gap energies of the photocatalysts were determined using the Kubelka-Munk theory of reflectance and extrapolating from its plot. FTIR spectra was carried out by PerkinElmer (model Shimadzu IRTrace 100), spectrum 2000 spectrometer in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectra for the catalyst samples were carried out by Raman Spectrometer (Lab RAM HR Evolution, HORIBA) at room temperature through excitation source of 325 and 532 nm lasers, respectively. The thermal strength of the composite was studied through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) by Metler-Toledo with air flow rate of 200 mL min−1 and heating rate of 2 °C/min and 10–900 °C as the temperature range for thermal decomposition."
6,Photoactivity test,"2.5 Photoactivity test The photocatalytic hydrogen production was carried out in a liquid phase slurry reactor under visible light using Xenon lamp (AC 35W Ballast) without applying UV-cut filters. A 5 vol % methanol solution was prepared as a feed stock and 120 mL was placed in a reactor of 150 mL total volume. Typically, 0.1 g photocatalyst was added into the methanol-water solution and suspension was magnetically stirred while flushing the reactor with N2 gas in the dark for 30 min at N2 flow rate 15 mL min−1. After 30 min, the lamp was turned on to allow the irradiation process. The hydrogen gas was collected in a sampling bag that was connected with the reactor. Efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production was also analyzed by varying catalyst loading of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 g. The sacrificial reagents including methanol, ethanol, ethyl glycol and glycerol with 5 vol % concentrations were tested under the same reaction conditions. The stability study was conducted in three cycles up to 4 h reaction time using both methanol and glycerol as sacrificial reagents with 0.1 g catalyst loading. Lastly, the slurry suspension having spent catalyst and sacrificial agent-water mixture was oven dried to separate the catalyst from the solution and residue (TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2) was obtained to study the FTIR and TGA analysis. After every hour of irradiation, hydrogen was measured by thermal conductivity hydrogen analyzer (Brotie Model 100). Gas products such as H2, CO2 and CH4 were also analyzed during online gas chromatography (GC-Agilent Technologies 6890 N, USA) equipped with flame-ionized detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization Crystalline structure of TiO2, TiO2/Ni2P, TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 samples was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique as shown in Fig. 2 (a). The XRD patterns of layered Ti3AlC2 displays characteristics peaks located at 2θ of 19.2°, 34.0°, 36.8°, 39.0°, 41.8°, 44.9°, 48.5°, 52.4°, 56.5°, 60.3°, 65.5°, 72.4° and 74.5°, assigned to (004), (101), (103), (104), (105), (106), (107), (108), (109), (110), (1011), (1012) and (118) crystallographic planes of pristine Ti3AlC2, respectively. All the diffraction peaks are in accordance with JCPDS No. 52–0875. The two sharp diffraction peaks for Ti3AlC2 at 39.0° and 41.8° indicates high rate of crystallinity [35]. Similarly, the diffraction peaks at 2θ of 25.62°, 37.81°, 48.05°, 53.92°, 55.05° and 62.72° corresponds to (101), (004), (200), (105), (211) and (204) crystallographic planes of TiO2 with anatase phase (JCPDS 21–1272) [36,37]. The XRD patterns of the TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite displayed comparable and blended diffraction peak patterns for both the pristine TiO2 and Ti3AlC2 with indication of hexagonal Ni2P at diffraction peak 40.76° and 44.65°corresponding to plane (111) and (201), respectively in accordance to JCPDS NO. 65–3544. According to literature, diffraction peaks at 40.7°, 44.6°, 47.4° and 54.2° corresponding to (111), (201), (210) and (300) planes were observed for pure hexagonal Ni2P (JCPDS card No. 89–4864) [38,39]. However, all these peaks were not observed in the composite due to its loading in small amount (3 wt %). Moreover, Ti3AlC2 undergoes oxidation on various temperatures and times with the formation of rutile and anatase TiO2 particles. It has been reported that oxidation of Ti3AlC2 with temperature 500–900 °C undergoes phase evolution of the surface composition and thickening of oxide layers [38,40]. However, in current study, due to using lower oxidation temperature (500 °C, 2 h), only small portion of Ti3AlC2 surface layer was converted to TiO2 NPs as shown in FESEM analysis (Fig. 3 ). This reveals, TiO2 NPs can be produced over Ti3AlC2 surface by heating at 500 °C under air atmosphere. The crystal sizes, cell parameters and lattice parameters (a, b, c) for pristine TiO2, TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite are summarized in Table 1 . The crystallite sizes for TiO2, estimated based on XRD (101) peak, of 15.7, 8.1 and 44.2 nm were obtained using TiO2, TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 samples, respectively. Obviously, TiO2 crystal size was reduced when dispersed over Ti3AlC2 during synthesis process. However, crystal size was increased in the composite, probably due to the addition of Ni2P into the composite. According to literature, calcination of Ni2P at high temperature (450–600 οC), generates more sharp peaks, indicating more formation of Ni2P particles with increased crystal sizes. Thus, TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite calcined at 500ο C promoted the formation of increased Ni2P particles, which contributed in larger crystal size of TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 in comparison with pure TiO2 and TiO2/Ti3AlC2 [41]. Moreover, crystal cell lattice and cell volume were found to be a = 3.784 Å, b = 3.784 Å, c = 9.511 Å and V = 135.54 Å3, confirming tetragonal crystal shape of anatase TiO2. This reveals that loading Ni2P and Ti3AlC2 did not effected the cell volume and lattice parameters of TiO2. Raman spectroscopy was further used to determine composition and purity of samples and results are demonstrated in Fig. 2 (b). Ti3AlC2 sample displays vibrational modes at 150, 204, 265, 412 and 605 cm−1 corresponding to ω1, ω2 ω3, ω4 and ω5 characteristic modes of MAX Ti3AlC2 phase and are linked to the Ti and Al in the Ti3AlC2 [42,43]. The Raman peaks for pristine TiO2 are located at 142 cm−1 with Eg (1) mode and a lower intensity peaks at 197 cm−1 with Eg (2), peak at 394 cm−1 with B1g mode and a single merged peak at 513 cm−1 (A1g + B1g) [44]. Formation of anatase TiO2 was further revealed by the characteristics peak at 640 cm−1, corresponding to Eg (3) mode. Furthermore, all the distinctive peaks of pristine TiO2 were found in the Raman spectra of TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 samples. More importantly, dispersion of TiO2 and Ni2P on the Ti3AlC2 led to difficulty in identifying peaks of Ti3AlC2 in the Raman spectra of TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite samples. This proves that bands of TiO2 show higher frequency than Al but after addition of Ti3AlC2 to TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2, the band of TiO2 at 142 cm−1 was shifted to 147 cm−1 which indicates well dispersed Ti3AlC2 with TiO2. Furthermore, in accordance with the previous reports, there exists no obvious Raman peak for pure Ni2P, which is likely to be associated with its specific molecular symmetry and low percentage of Ni2P used in composite synthesis [39,45,46]. FTIR spectra of TiO2, Ti3AlC2, TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite were investigated for the determination of functional groups at wavenumber 400–4000 cm−1 and results are shown in Fig. 2 (c). In TiO2 spectrum, the absorption band at 1635 cm−1 and 3454 cm−1 are related to stretching of O–H. The vibrations of Ti -O –Ti bands present at 490 cm−1 [47,48]. Ti3AlC2 showed FTIR peaks between 2100 and 2400 cm−1 and at 1528 cm−1 corresponding to Al–OH stretching vibration, C–C and C–O vibrations, respectively. Al–O, Ti–O and Ti–C vibrational modes are indicated by peaks at 553 cm−1. Moreover, MAX phase Ti3AlC2 exhibits bands corresponding to vibrations at 3752 cm−1 associated with stretching vibrational modes of Fermi resonance by overtone of the OH bending mode [49]. The FTIR spectrum of Ni2P and Ti3AlC2 modified TiO2 composites has changed as the TiO2 peaks corresponding to bending vibration of O–H was prominent for Ni2P/TiO2, Ti3AlC2/TiO2 and Ti3AlC2/Ni2P/TiO2 at 1648, 1638 and 1636 cm−1, respectively. Likewise, Ti3AlC2/TiO2 and Ti3AlC2/Ni2P/TiO2 constituted one Ti3AlC2 peak at about 1520 cm−1 relating to C–C and C–O vibrational mode. Nanocomposite of Ni2P/TiO2 and Ti3AlC2/Ni2P/TiO2 indicated peak at 3676 and 3617 cm−1, respectively, which is due to PO–H stretching modes. This indicates acidity caused by species containing phosphorous [50]. Fig. 3 (a) exhibits FESEM images of pristine Ti3AlC2, pristine TiO2, calcined Ti3AlC2, TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite samples. Pristine TiO2 consists of homogeneous spherical shaped nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 3 (a). It can be interpreted that Ti3AlC2 constitutes a dense layered structure of thick and compressed staked sheets with less interlayer spacing and are tightly connected and packed with each other by metallic bonding as shown in Fig. 3 (b). Fig. 3 (c) shows that with calcination of pristine Ti3AlC2 at 500 °C for 2 h, TiO2 nanoparticles started to appear at the edges of compressed layers. Furthermore, in case of TiO2/Ti3AlC2, Ti3AlC2 is partially dispersed by TiO2 nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 3 (d). The homogeneity of TiO2 particles depends on the hydrolysis process, which is slowed down by the less availability of water, reducing TiO2 phase formation. Fig. 3 (e, f) shows FESEM of TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite demonstrating compressed stacked sheets irregularly dispersed by heterojunction of Ni2P/TiO2 nanoparticles to develop a 2D structured composite having increased contact within its components. The effective dispersion of Ni2P onto Ti3AlC2 and less wt. % of Ni2P (3 wt %) in composite makes identification of Ni2P difficult. TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite catalyst is considered as a heterogeneous because the nanocomposite consists of nanoscale cluster of both particles and sheets. EDX mapping of TiO2/Ni2P dispersed Ti3AlC2 sample is depicted in Fig. 3 (g). The evidence for presence of TiO2/Ni2P over Ti3AlC2 sheets can be seen in EDX analysis. Fig. 3 (h) depicts EDX plot of elements, justifying the existence of aluminum, titanium, carbon, nickel, phosphorus and oxygen elements in TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite, which confirms formation of nanocomposite successfully. Fig. 4 shows morphology of TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite carried out using HRTEM analysis. Fig. 4 (a) shows image of TiO2 sample which clearly revealing uniform and mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles. Fig. 4 (b) displays layered structure of Ti3AlC2. Fig. 4 (c, d) illustrates dark areas corresponding to compact layered Ti3AlC2, while lighter areas correspond to nanoparticles of TiO2, which proves that TiO2 nanoparticles are highly dispersed on the surface of layered Ti3AlC2. Ni2P was not recognized as it was used in very less quantity. Furthermore, combined dispersion of TiO2 and Ni2P on Ti3AlC2 shows formation of a good heterojunction between TiO2 and Ni2P. Fig. 4 (e) shows the interplaner distance that was estimated to be 0.347 and 0.21 nm for TiO2 and Ti3AlC2, respectively. The surface chemical states of the TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite sample was investigated using XPS and the results are depicted in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5 (a) displays Ti 2p spectra showing binding energies positioned at ∼ 458.9 and 464.8 eV corresponding to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively and confirms the existence of Ti4+ or TiO2. Another peak positioned at 461.1 eV was also observed indicating Ti as Ti–C in Ti3AlC2. Fig. 5 (b) demonstrates XPS spectrum for O 1s indicating three peaks having approximate binding energies of around 528.5, 531.1 and 532.6 eV with the first allocated to oxygen bonded to Ti4+, oxygen loss or formation of oxygen vacancies is depicted by the middle peak and the last peak at 532.6 eV is assigned to OC bond [51]. Fig. 5 (c) shows high resolution C 1s spectrum depicting three peaks at approximately 284.6, 286.9 and 289.4 eV. Binding energy peak at 284.6 eV is related to sp2 carbon phase, while C–O–C or C–O–H bond is depicted at 286.9 eV. Peak with 289.4 eV binding energy can be attributed to C(O)OH or HO–C–OH bonds [52,53]. Fig. 5 (d) demonstrates XPS spectra for Ni 2p comprising of two spin orbit doublets at binding energy (BE) values of 855.8 and 868.4 eV, corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively with shake up satellites of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 depicted at binding energy peaks of 864.7 and 879.6 eV, respectively [54]. Fig. 5 (e) depicts the Al peak at 75.0 eV binding energy corresponding to Al in oxide-like bonding [55]. XPS spectrum for P 2p peak is depicted in Fig. 5 (f) showing binding energy between 132.0 and 133.0 eV attributing to the presence of phosphonate compounds. Fig. 6 (a) presents UV–visible light absorption analysis for the investigation of light harvesting efficiency of TiO2, Ti3AlC2, TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite samples. The wavelength of pure TiO2 was positioned at ∼400 nm, indicating its wider band gap. This allows TiO2 to only absorb shorter wavelength UV irradiation. The UV–vis absorption spectra of Ti3AlC2 demonstrated no apparent evidence of absorption edge in 200–800 nm region, which signified metallic nature of Ti3AlC2. This was also because of black color of Ti3AlC2, absorbing light irradiation in visible region. Furthermore, when Ti3AlC2 was coupled with TiO2, there was no significant effect on shifting band gap of TiO2 towards visible region, but light absorption in the visible region was increased due to dark color of Ti3AlC2 and similarly reported previously [31]. Furthermore, when Ni2P was added to Ti3AlC2/TiO2 composite, there was no significant effect on shifting band edge position, but light absorption in the visible region was significantly increased. According to literature, UV–vis spectrum of Ni2P shows a straight line indicating absorption from 200 to 800 nm, but it has no effect on shifting band edge of TiO2 towards visible region. Luo et al. [21], reported the synthesis of 0D/2D Ni2P/TiO2 composite and found Ni2P deposited on TiO2 has no effect on shifting band gap energy. However, compared to pristine TiO2, all the Ni2P/TiO2 composite samples showed enhanced absorption in the visible region due to changing composite catalyst color from white to dark. All these findings revel coupling TiO2 with Ni2P would enable visible light absorption due to dark color without shifting absorption edge of TiO2 towards visible region. The enhanced absorption in the region of 400–800 nm can also be ascribed due to narrow band gap of Ni2P (∼1 eV) [56–59]. Thus, showing the contribution of dark color of Ti3AlC2 and Ni2P, increasing visible light absorption without shifting band edge of TiO2. The energy band gaps (Ebg) of pure TiO2, TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 were calculated by Tauc plot using Eq. (1). (1) Eb g = ( αhv ) 2 The calculated band gap energies for TiO2, TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 were estimated to be 3.15, 3.04 and 3.09 eV, respectively as shown in Fig. 6 (b). As observed in the Tauc plot, Ti3AlC2 shows a straight line with obvious evidence that it acts as a conductor and contributes only to the red shift in wavelength of TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 based on its efficient light absorption due to dark color. Although, band gap energy of Ti3AlC2 was not identified due to its light absorption over the entire range, but it showed photocatalytic activity, probably due to the presence of TiO2 NPs attached to its surface during the oxidation process. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum was employed to generate PL emissions for investigation of charge carrier’s recombination. PL emission spectra of the samples were carried out at 325 nm excitation wavelength as shown in Fig. 6 (c). In general, low recombination of charge carrier is indicated by lower PL intensity [47,60]. Pristine TiO2 showed an intense PL peak intensity, which indicated increased rate of electron hole pair recombination. Pure Ti3AlC2 showed PL intensity closer to zero, probably due to lower production of electrons. This similar outcome can also be observed by UV–visible spectra based on the dark color of Ti3AlC2. Upon dispersion of TiO2 onto Ti3AlC2, the PL intensity was reduced. This indicates that the 2D Max phase Ti3AlC2 is efficient for trapping electrons in its ultrathin layered structure, which induces unique optical and electronic properties towards photocatalytic H2 production. According to studies, the low PL intensity of Ni2P contributes to efficient charge transfer and reduction of charge recombination of the composite [59,61]. Furthermore, in the case of TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2, the PL emission peak was significantly decreased, indicating proficient charge carrier separation and less recombination. Hence, photocatalytic activity of TiO2 towards H2 production can be enhanced by efficient charge separation that can be accomplished by modification with Ni2P and Ti3AlC2."
9,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production Fig. 7 (a) represents the photoactivity of catalysts towards H2 production and also depicts the effect of Ni2P and Ti3AlC2 loading on the pure TiO2. Photocatalytic H2 production using pristine TiO2 was observed to be 3418 μmolg−1. The lower production of H2 by TiO2 was related to its wider band gap and fast charge carrier recombination rate. Using pristine Ti3AlC2, lower amount of H2 i.e., 2000 μmolg−1 was produced, thus indicating its lower efficiency, and was estimated to be 1.89 folds lower than the pristine TiO2. Although, Ti3AlC2 is deemed to be co-catalyst duo to excellent electrical conductivity, but its photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production would be due to the presence of TiO2 NPs over its surface. A further increased in photoactivity of pristine Ti3AlC2 was observed after calcination, as pristine Ti3AlC2 clacined at 500 οC for 2 h showed 2500 μmol g−1 of H2 production, which was observed to be is 1.4 times higher than pristine Ti3AlC2. This can be justified by FESEM image of calcined Ti3AlC2, which shows TiO2 particles appearing on the edges of layered structure of Ti3AlC2, contributing to enhance activity by promoting efficient charge carrier separation. This confirms that conductive properties of Ti3AlC2 promote oxidation and reduction reactions over the TiO2 surface. As it can be seen that TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P showed 10030 and 3580 μmolg−1 of H2 indicating 2.49 times and 1.04 times higher activity, respectively, compared to pristine TiO2. Loading Ni2P played significant role in enhancing photocatalytic H2 production activity based on electron trapping ability, which helped in reducing charge carrier recombination. However, the enhanced activity of TiO2/Ti3AlC2 as compared to TiO2/Ni2P can be attributed to the enhanced activity of oxidized Ti3AlC2 with improved conductive properties as similarly observed reported by PL analysis. The higher dispersion of TiO2 over 2D layered structure of Ti3AlC2 also enables good interaction of TiO2 with proficient charge carrier separation, resulting in significantly enhanced H2 evolution. Furthermore, the dispersion of TiO2/Ni2P onto layered Ti3AlC2 further improved the photocatalytic H2 production. Highest H2 amount of 13000 μmolg−1 was obtained over TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite, which is 1.29, 3.63 and 3.80 times more the amount generated by TiO2/Ti3AlC2, TiO2/Ni2P and pristine TiO2, respectively. This enhanced H2 production of TiO2/Ni2P dispersed Ti3AlC2 was obviously due to formation of TiO2/Ni2P heterojunction and good dispersion over 2D layered MAX structure. Heterojunction of TiO2/Ni2P promoted charge separation by trapping electrons, whereas Ti3AlC2 acted as a mediator for charge carrier transportation. Moreover, the ability of 2D MAX phase Ti3AlC2 to trap electrons in its ultrathin layered structure induced unique optical and electronic properties which played role in promising photocatalytic H2 production. The reduction reaction of H+ to H2 was also boosted by the provision of increased surface area and strong in-plane covalent bonding of Ti3AlC2 structure by Ti3AlC2 with the availability of more active sites for H2 production reaction [31,62]. Fig. 7 (b) describes the effect of Ni2P loading (1, 3, and 5 wt %) onto TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite for photocatalytic H2 production under visible light from methanol-water mixture. Incorporating Ni2P into the nanocomposite increased H2 production as compared to pure TiO2. 3 wt % Ni2P in TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 gave highest rate of H2 production which is 3.63 and 3.80 folds higher than produced from TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and pure TiO2, respectively. This shows that Ni2P in the composite hindered charge carrier recombination and promotes separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The significant enhancement of H2 production activity can also be attributed to high dispersion of TiO2/Ni2P on layered Ti3AlC2. Moreover, Ni2P content below 3 wt % and above 5 wt % showed lower H2 generation. Undoubtedly, the activity reduction in case of excess contents of Ni2P can be attributed to decrease active sites on TiO2 surface due to excessive particle agglomeration. The decreased activity can also be associated to the formation of photo-generated charge carrier recombination centers [63,64]. The schematic illustration on enhanced photocatalytic H2 production over pure and composite catalysts has been illustrated in Fig. 8 . Fig. 8 (a) shows that TiO2 is capable of generating electrons-hole pairs under UV light irradiations based on its wide band gap (∼3.2 eV). According to experimental results, hydrogen production over pristine TiO2 was observed under visible light irradiation. This was obviously due to using visible light without UV-cut filters, thus TiO2 was activated due to UV–visible light, resulting in hydrogen production. However, without TiO2 surface modification with Ni2P and/or Ti3AlC2, the H2 production was lower. This can be attributed to the immediate recombination of photo-generated electrons-hole pairs over the TiO2 surface. Fig. 8 (b) illustrates photocatalytic hydrogen production over Ni2P/TiO2 composite with proficient charge carrier separation. When Ni2P as a cocatalyst was loaded to TiO2 surface, the photo-generated electrons from CB of TiO2 were transferred to Ni2P, indicating its efficient electron trapping ability. This is because of the lower conduction band edge of Ni2P (−0.23 eV) than the CB of TiO2 (−0.50 eV), enabling charge carrier separation [39]. Thus, Ni2P coupled with TiO2 is functioning as a metal to trap and transport electrons over the TiO2 surface and preventing photo-generated electron-hole pair recombination. According to experimental results, production of hydrogen over Ni2P/TiO2 composite was not much significant compared to employing pristine TiO2. The lower efficiency of Ni2P/TiO2 for hydrogen production could be explained based on 0D/0D heterojunction formation between Ni2P and TiO2 NPs. As the large size Ni2P particles were loaded with TiO2 NPs, their interaction was not proficient due to point contact among the 0D/0D particles of Ni2P/TiO2 as demonstrated in Fig. 8 (b). Thus, photogenerated charge carrier at TiO2 surface were not effectively transferred towards Ni2P, resulting in lower amount of hydrogen production. Comparatively, a significant amount of hydrogen production was observed over TiO2/Ti3AlC2 composite compared to pristine TiO2 NPs. According to UV–visible results, Ti3AlC2 has no effect on altering band gap energy of TiO2, but PL results confirm a proficient charge carrier separation due to its good electron conductive characteristics. Therefore, significantly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production over TiO2/Ti3AlC2 was due to good dispersion of TiO2 over 2D layered Ti3AlC2 MAX structure as shown in Fig. 8 (c). Obviously, TiO2 NPs have good dispersion over 2D Ti3AlC2 MAX structure, promoting charge carrier separation and resulting in significantly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production. Moreover, a significant enhancement of photocatalytic H2 production activity was observed by calcined Ti3AlC2 sample as compared to un-calcined Ti3AlC2 as discussed previously due the presence of additional TiO2 particles on surface of Ti3AlC2. This effects the efficiency of pristine Ti3AlC2 by providing increased active sites and by proficient transportation of electrons due to good conductive properties. Fig. 8 (d) shows the interaction of Ni2P, TiO2 and Ti3AlC2 with direction of electron transfer for photocatalytic hydrogen production. In TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite, 0D NPs of TiO2 and Ni2P were uniformly dispersed over the 2D layered structure of Ti3AlC2, enabling proficient transfer of electrons from the CB of TiO2 towards Ti3AlC2 and Ni2P NPs. In addition, electrons trapped by Ni2P from TiO2 would also be transferred towards Ti3AlC2 surface for their efficient separation. This synergistic effect of Ni2P and Ti3AlC2 with good dispersion of nanoparticles over Ti3AlC2 layered structure, enabling significantly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production. Thus, TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite photocatalyst demonstrated highest activity due to higher electron transportation due to multiple electron transporting channels. The effect of different sacrificial agents on the performance of composite catalyst for photocatalytic H2 generation with 0.01 g catalyst loading and 15 mL min−1 N2 flow rate was evaluated and results are depicted in Fig. 9 (a). Evidently, lower amount of H2 was produced using pure water, which was significantly improved by utilizing various sacrificial reagents under the same operating parameters. This is because sacrificial reagents act as holes scavengers and significantly influence the activity of photocatalyst. Currently, no semiconductor has been reported to produce high rate of H2 from pure water. Generally, organic compounds are involved in promoting photocatalytic H2 reaction by capturing holes and inhibiting charge recombination. Organic compounds act as sacrificial agents and promote water splitting. Besides, photo-reforming of sacrificial agents also takes place, leading to oxidation of sacrificial agents in the presence of water into H2 and CO2 [65]. Highest H2 production was observed using glycerol, which was 1.42, 2.27, 5.07 and 60.9 folds higher than using ethylene glycol, methanol, ethanol and pure water, respectively. In general, H2 production strongly depends on the number of OH bonds, standard oxidation potential and polarity. Thus, the increased in polarity of alcohols influences H2 evolution positively. H2 production was observed to increase in order ethanol (C2H6O) < methanol (CH4O) < ethylene glycerol (C2H6O2) < glycerol (C3H8O3) [66]. Furthermore, standard oxidation potentials calculated form standard Gibbs energies stated that increased in oxidation potential of alcohols causes a decreased in H2 production. The H2 production was decreased in order glycerol > ethylene glycol > methanol > ethanol owing to their oxidation potentials. Hence, during photocatalytic reaction alcohols are oxidized based on their standard oxidation potentials, which is lower than oxidation potential of pure water i.e., 1.23 V versus NHE [67]. Furthermore, the presence of total α-hydrogen atoms in alcohols also contributes in stimulating H2 production [68]. Molecular structure of glycerol, ethylene glycol and methanol consist of more carbon atoms attached to α -hydrogen atoms therefore, they showed more efficiency towards H2 production as compared to ethanol. According to literature, linear increased of reaction rate was observed with methanol and glycerol towards H2 production. H2 volume was increased with increasing hydroxyl groups on both the alcohols. Methanol and glycerol generated 8 ml and 23 ml of H2, respectively with same molar concentration. This proved that more hydroxyl groups in alcohol structure played a vital role in enhancing photocatalytic activity of glycerol as compared to ethanol, methanol and ethylene glycol. This is based on the difference between adsorption capacities of generated intermediates by methanol and ethanol [69]. Similarly, a study demonstrates that methanol gives higher results at high concentration as compared to ethanol [70]. Also, methanol constitutes high hydrogen/carbon ratio as compared to ethanol, which is beneficial towards H2 production [71]. Methanol depicts higher H2 production as the mechanism involves direct oxidation predominantly, which makes methanol a better hole scavenger reagent than ethanol and results in higher hydrogen production. All these findings confirm that sacrificial reagents contribute significantly toward hydrogen production through preventing charge carrier recombination, by providing more protons and by enabling more hydrogen production through photo-reforming. The performance comparison of irradiation time for pure TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2/Ni2P, TiO2/Ti3AlC2 and TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposites under visible light irradiation was further investigated and the results are presented in Fig. 9 (b). The continuous production of H2 was acquired over irradiation time with increasing trend towards H2 generation. It can be noticed that without Ni2P and Ti3AlC2, pristine TiO2 photocatalyst demonstrated lower photoactivity for H2 production. Thus, the photocatalytic H2 production activity of TiO2 was boosted by increasing Ti3AlC2 and Ni2P content. However, the H2 production was increased up to the optimum content of Ti3AlC2 and Ni2P i.e., 25 wt % and 3 wt %. Declined in H2 production rate was observed for the nanocomposite catalyst beyond this optimum value. This was possibly due to the low activity of pristine Ti3AlC2 and Ni2P and their decreased visible light absorption. The H2 yield of TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 was 1.29, 3.63 and 3.80 times higher than TiO2/Ti3AlC2, TiO2/Ni2P and pristine TiO2, respectively, which can be associated with the dispersion of TiO2/Ni2P onto Ti3AlC2 providing increased visible light activity, increased surface area, improved charge transport and reduced rate of charge carrier recombination. Fig. 9 (c) depicts the effect of varying TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 catalyst loading on H2 production. When TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 catalyst loading was increased from 0.05 to 0.1 g, H2 production was also increased with highest H2 production of 52000 μmol g−1 with 0.1 g catalyst loading. This increased in H2 production was due to the increased in catalyst loading, which increases the active sites and promoted separation of electron hole pairs [72]. Decreased in H2 rate of 15960 μmol g−1 was observed for 0.2 g catalyst loading possibly due to increase in turbidity of solution with more catalyst, which reduced penetration of light and exposed surface area of catalyst [73]. To further understand about the performance of catalysts and types of catalytic reaction initiated by light irradiations, gaseous products were analyzed using GC. The production of CO2 and CH4 over the TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite during water splitting from glycerol-water and methanol-water mixture has been demonstrated in Fig. 10 . Fig. 10 (a) shows the continuous production of CO2 over TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 from 5% methanol-water and 5% glycerol-water mixture under visible light irradiation. Prominently, using glycerol there was a gradual increased in CO2 yield with irradiation time, while for methanol the yield for CO2 was decreased with irradiation time. Fig. 10 (b) depicts continuous production of CH4 over the TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite using 5% glycerol-water and 5% methanol-water mixture under 4 h visible light irradiation. Glycerol-water mixture showed increased yield of CH4 with irradiation time, however, the yield somewhat started to decline after 3 h irradiation time. Despite of this, glycerol-water mixture produced higher yield of CH4 in comparison to CH4 produced from methanol-water mixture. This can be explained by the photo-reforming reaction in the presence of methanol and glycerol to oxidize photogenerated organic compounds. Photo-reforming takes place by utilizing photogenerated holes and leaving behind free electrons for H+ to H2 reduction reaction as shown in Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated dependence of H2 production rate on quantity of hydroxyl groups on alcohol, which effects the alcohol polarity, binding mode on the catalyst, alcohol adsorption strength and oxidation potential of alcohol [74]. This confirms the increased CO2 production of 5100 μmol g−1 from glycerol, which is estimated to be 5.3 times higher than it was produced from the methanol. This can be justified as glycerol produces 3 mol of CO2 against 1 mol of CO2 produced from methanol. Both water splitting and photo-reforming takes place simultaneously, however rate of H2 is much more in photo-reforming due to scavenging of photogenerated holes by the organic compounds, which reduces rate of charge carrier recombination [75]. Furthermore, the production of CH4 can be explained by the transformation of the produced CO2 to CH4. This can be explained using energy band theory on basis of relative positions of CB, VB and oxidation potentials. According to the theory, the consumption of photo-generated electrons was efficient possibly because of lower reduction potential difference to the CB of TiO2 (E (CO2/CH4) = −0.24 V), which favored production of CH4 [76]. Thus, capability of TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite to produce higher number of electrons is evidence from the formation of CH4 as 8 electrons are required for CH4 formation as depicted in Eq. (4). This reveals stable photoactivity of TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite for continuous CH4 and CO2 production under visible light irradiation. (2) CH O 3 H + H O 2 → CO 2 + 6 H + + 6 e − (3) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H O 2 → 3 CO 2 + 14 H + + 14 e - (4) CO 2 + 8 H + + 8 e - → CH + 4 2 H 2 O The performance of TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite photocatalyst was compared with the previous literature and the results are presented in Table 2 . Ternary g-C3N4/rGO/Ni2P showed maximum H2 yield of 504 μmol g−1h−1 after 5 h irradiation time [77]. Similarly, 55 μmol g−1h−1 rate of H2 production was observed by Sr doped TiO2–ZrO2 [78]. Likewise, Cu2O/(001) TiO2@Ti3C2Tx gave H2 yield of 600 μmol g−1h−1 under 6 h irradiation time [79]. In the present study, higher H2 production over the TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 was obviously due to Ni2P as a cocatalyst for increasing capacity to trap electrons and good electron conductive properties of Ti3AlC2 with efficient dispersion of nanoparticles, resulting increased H2 production. The practical application of the developed photocatalyst can be accomplished by the investigation of stability and life of nanocomposite catalyst. TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite photocatalyst was tested for stability towards photocatalytic hydrogen production from 5% methanol-water and 5% glycerol-water mixture as shown in Fig. 11 (a). Usually, 0.1 g of catalyst was dispersed in 120 mL aqueous solution of 5% methanol or 5% glycerol for cyclic run stability in slurry phase photoreactor. Pyrex glass photo-reactor was flushed for an hour without light irradiation to eliminate the H2 in the system by N2 gas at the rate of 15 mL min−1. Photo-stability was investigated for 16 h in 3 consecutive cycles with sample collection after every hour. After every cyclic run, the lamp was turned off for an hour before starting next cycle to remove H2 and other gases from the photoreactor system. For continuous flow of photoreactor, H2 rate from both methanol and glycerol was highest for first cyclic run and it started decline for 2nd cyclic runs under visible light irradiations with significant reduction in H2 production for 3rd cyclic run. Reduction in sacrificial agent concentration and intermediate products saturated on catalyst sites resulted in H2 production reduction in 2nd and 3rd cyclic run for photocatalytic H2 production. This proves that sacrificial agent including glycerol and methanol have potential to improve photocatalytic activity significantly. The trends of continuous stability over TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 form methanol and glycerol up to 2nd cycle was evident from the stability test. However, in comparison to methanol, the stability test for glycerol revealed increased H2 production activity with increased stability. This can be ascribed to the fact that more α-H atom and OH group in glycerol promotes improved H2 production under the same operating conditions. This declares that TiO2/Ni2P dispersed over Ti3AlC2 retains suitable stability and reusability. The nanocomposite showed stable photoactivity from methanol and glycerol-water mixture over cyclic runs under visible light because of improved charge separation, improved visible light absorption and increased active site leading to H2 production for sustainable development. Fig. 11 (b) shows FTIR comparison of fresh and spent TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite photocatalyst. The FTIR spectrum for fresh Ti3AlC2/Ni2P/TiO2 nanocomposite constituted one TiO2 peak at 1636 cm−1 indicating bending vibration of O–H, Ti3AlC2 peak at 1520 cm−1 relating to C–C and C–O vibrational mode and peak at 3617 cm−1 representing PO–H stretching modes. After 12 h there was no apparent change in phase composition instead of some additional peaks of TiO2. This is an indication of good photoactivity and possibility for recovery for the photocatalyst. Spend nanocomposite of TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 indicated additional FTIR peaks at 550 cm−1 corresponding to bending vibration (Ti–O–Ti) bonds in lattice of the TiO2. Ti–O stretching band was indicated by peak at 692 cm−1. Peaks at 3735 cm−1 and 3547 cm−1 correspond to the intermolecular contact of hydroxyl group of water molecule with the surface of TiO2 [82,83]. The thermal stability of the nanocomposite sample was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The mass loss of nanocomposite is observed in various temperature ranges as depicted in Fig. 11 (c). For fresh TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 sample, the sudden 4% weight occurs between 30 and 100 °C possibly due to indulgence of composite’s moisture, gaseous substances, methanol or can be because of drop of labile oxygen from the functional groups like hydroxyl, carbonyl and epoxy groups [84]. The TGA of spent TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 sample shows 10% weight loss within two different temperature ranges indicating different stages of weight loss. First stage weight loss between 30 and 200 °C indicates loss of moisture, gaseous substances or methanol or can be because of drop of labile oxygen from functional groups like hydroxyl, carbonyl and epoxy groups. Moreover, slight weight loss around 550–600 °C can possibly be associated to the presence of carbon due to surface structure of Ti3AlC2 accumulated after usage of the composite. The less weight loss for fresh and spent catalysts shows high thermal stability. Furthermore, the nanocomposite can be induced with more improved conductive and dielectric properties based on localized sandwich assembly of TiO2 nanoparticles with carbon sheets supported by Ti3AlC2 layers."
10,Mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.3 Mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen production Efficient light absorption, rapid charge carrier separation and increased surface reactions are essential for enhanced photocatalytic reaction. Considering the TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite, the enhanced activity can be attributed to Ni2P semiconductor and Ti3AlC2 sheets as compared to pristine TiO2. Consequently, schematic illustration of the proposed mechanism has been demonstrated in Fig. 12. TiO2 and Ni2P nanoparticles were dispersed on layered Ti3AlC2. With light illumination, TiO2 is excited and electron-hole pairs are generated as illustrated in Eq. (7). Normally, there exists low photocatalytic activity of pristine TiO2 due to rapid recombination of electron–hole pairs. However, in the presence of Ni2P as a cocatalyst, the electron-hole pairs recombination can also be reduced by complete injection of these photo-generated electrons into Ni2P co-catalyst, as according to literature Ni2P constitute band gap of 1 eV with conduction band edge at (−0.23 eV) which is lower than CB of TiO2 (−0.50 eV) [21,56,57,85]. Increased driving force for hydrogen generation reaction can be obtained; ensuring efficient electron-hole pair separation at the interface by injection of electrons into phosphides, which could upshift the Fermi level [86]. Finally, the accumulated electrons in Ni2P co-catalyst would reduce H+ ions to generate molecular hydrogen. Since, the absorbed photons by Ni2P nanoparticles did not contribute to the photocatalytic reaction, it is concluded that the charge transfer and surface reaction of TiO2 are greatly influenced by modification by Ni2P. Ti3AlC2 acts as electron acceptor and providing more active sites for H2 production. Good interaction between TiO2 dispersed Ti3AlC2 layers led to fast charge transfer based on the conductive property of Ti3AlC2 [62]. Owing to the less positive oxidation potential of methanol as compared to water, methanol can easily consume photo-generated holes during oxidation process. Eqs. (8) and (9) shows that reaction of h+ and OH• ions generate hydroxyl radicals. Oxidation can be initiated using h+ or by indirect path involving OH• ions. This would lead to the accumulation of photgenerated electrons on surface of Ni2P for its reaction with H+. Reactions involved in photocatalytic hydrogen generation mechanism over TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 composite with methanol-water mixture are described in Eqs. (5)–(15) [87,88].

(8) and (9)), in which methanol is converted to radical anion intermediate and electron is injected into the conduction band of TiO2. It states that a hydrogen molecule can be generated by one photon. In other case the methanol radical anion could react with the OH• radical to produce H+ (Eqs. (10)–(14)). Finally, as mentioned above the electrons are injected into Ni2P co-catalyst as shown in Eq. (15). According to experimental results, H2 production was significantly recognized as main product of photocatalytic reaction over TiO2/Ni2P dispersed MAX Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite catalyst in a slurry photoreactor system. The efficiency of composite catalyst was future studied by demonstrating the photo-reforming reaction of TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 in the presence of methanol-water and glycerol-water mixture, confirming the evolution of significant yield of CO2 as gas product. Moreover, the lower reduction potential difference to the CB of TiO2 (Eo(CO2/CH4) = −0.24 V) lead to some amount of CH4 production. Furthermore, glycerol-water mixture was capable of exhibiting higher potential for H2, CO2 and CH4 production due to the production of more photon and OH ions. Compared to pure TiO2, a significant increase in gas product especially H2 was observed when Ni2P and Ti3AlC2 were loaded to construct structured TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 heterojunction composite. This was obviously due to efficient electron trapping property of Ni2P and charge transport property of Ti3AlC2 with provision of more active sites or H+ for H2 reduction reaction."
11,Conclusion,"TiO2/Ni2P dispersed MAX phase Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite was synthesized successfully by sol gel approach and tested for photocatalytic H2 production under visible light irradiations from methanol-water mixture. Highest H2 production rate of 13000 μmolg−1 was obtained over TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite with 0.1 g catalyst loading as optimum value and 5% methanol-water mixture depicting enhanced photocatalytic activity, which was observed to be 1.29, 3.63 and 3.80 times more the amount generated by TiO2/Ti3AlC2, TiO2/Ni2P and pristine TiO2, respectively. Similarly, H2 production with sacrificial agents was observed to increase in order: pure water < ethanol < methanol < ethyl glycol < glycerol. Highest H2 production activity of glycerol was due to its highest polarity, low standard oxidation and more α-hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms. Highest photocatalytic activity was shown with 3 wt % of Ni2P content in the nanocomposite with reduction of activity above this optimum content. The nanocomposite showed continuous H2 production activity with increasing irradiation time up to 3 h along with continuous production of H2 over 3 cyclic run, showing stability of the nanocomposite due to highly dispersion of TiO2/Ni2P over the Ti3AlC2 structure. Therefore, TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 has great potential due to its appreciable stability and good photocatalytic activity for H2 production applications. The enhanced performance of TiO2/Ni2P/Ti3AlC2 nanocomposite was due to transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO2 to Ni2P, leading to enhance charge carrier separation, while Ti3AlC2 provided efficient charge transport and provided active sites for enhanced H2 evolution. Other gaseous products including CO2 and CH4 were also detected with methanol-water and glycerol-water mixture by photo-reforming, confirming the enhanced efficiency of nanocomposite. Increased protons and OH radicals of glycerol, contributed to its increased efficiency towards CO2 and CH4 production. This work provides basis for understanding of photocatalytic H2 production with photo-reforming reaction for CO2 and CH4 production, thus providing new dimensions for the development of new structured photocatalysts with enhanced photoactivity for solar energy application."
