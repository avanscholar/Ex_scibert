0,Introduction,"The role of catalysis in the development of clean chemical production with limited hazardous/toxic by-products is now well established as an essential element of sustainable processing [1,2]. Aromatic haloamines are extensively used as intermediates in the manufacture of pesticides, herbicides, pigments, pharmaceuticals and cosmetic products [3,4]. p-Chloroaniline (p-CAN), a high production volume compound [3], can be synthesised via Fe promoted reduction of p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB) in acid media (Bechamp reaction) or by selective hydrogenation using transition-metal catalysts. Industrial implementation of the Bechamp reaction is no longer viable due to the generation of significant amounts of toxic metal waste which requires costly and laborious separation and disposal [5]. Liquid phase catalytic hydrogenation has emerged as a cleaner alternative to the Bechamp process with higher associated product yields [6]. However, the economic benefits are dependent on catalyst performance, where unwanted C–Cl bond hydrogenolysis is difficult to fully circumvent. Reaction selectivity is critical as p-CNB hydrotreatment can generate a range of intermediates and by-products as shown in Fig. 1 , which presents the reaction pathways proposed for batch liquid phase hydrogenation [7–13]. The reduction of p-CNB to p-CAN involves the formation of nitroso- and hydroxylamine-intermediates (path I) that can participate in side reactions [14]. The formation of dimeric azoxybenzene (path II) and azobenzene (path III) results from condensation–reduction involving p-CAN where conversion of the hydrazobenzene intermediate to p-CAN (path IV) is favoured in basic media [15]. Azoxybenzene/azobenzene formation, as highly toxic compounds, must be avoided in the clean production of p-CAN. Disproportionation of the hydroxylamine intermediate to p-nitrosochlorobenzene and p-CAN requires significant formation of p-(chorophenyl)-hydroxylamine (path V). Hydrogenolysis of the halosubstituent with subsequent formation of aniline (AN), benzene (BZ) and/or cyclohexane can occur either via the reduction of nitrobenzene (NB) (path VI) or as a result of the further conversion of p-CAN (paths VII and VIII). The authors have failed to unearth any study dealing with the gas phase hydrogenation of p-CNB. Taking an overview of the existing literature on (homogeneous and heterogeneous) discontinuous liquid systems, elevated pressures (≥5atm) and/or temperatures (up to 542K) are required where C–Cl bond cleavage is an issue, contributing significantly to the overall pathway for reaction over monometallic Ni [9–11,14,16,17], Pd [12,13,15,18–20], Pt [7,8,21–25] and Ru [19,26] and bimetallic [8,9,11,12,16,17,19,21–23,27] catalysts. Preliminary results for batch liquid phase reaction over Ag [28] and Au [29] show promise in terms of achieving high selectivity. Several factors have been proposed to influence activity/selectivity that are dependent on catalyst structure (alloying, metal/support interactions and metal dispersion) [7–13,16,17,19,21–27,30] where variations in process variables such as solvent polarity [9,10,15,18] and p-CNB concentration [7–9,22,24–26] have a lesser effect. Coq et al. investigated the catalytic response for a series of supported Pt catalysts, focusing on the role of particle size [7], support/metal precursor [25] and the effect of adding a second metal (Sn, Pb, Ge, Al and Zn) [8], and concluded that p-CAN selectivity is sensitive to dispersion and the introduction of a second metal, a response that extends to Ru catalysts [26]. Han et al., have noted that the presence of an electron deficient promoter serves to promote selective p-CNB conversion over heterogeneous [21–23] and homogeneous [24] Pt catalysts. Chloronitroarene isomers have exhibited different reactivities, ascribed to steric/electronic factors [13,15,17,21,23,30,31], while the nature of the halogen also impacts on selectivity [31–34]. Photocatalytic and electrochemical reduction of p-CNB have been the subject of patent literature [5,35,36] where these approaches again involve batch operation but the available results are insufficient to permit a full evaluation of the associated efficiencies relative to catalytic hydrogenation. In this report, we present for the first time the results of a feasibility study to examine the viability of Ni promoted gas phase hydrogenation of p-CNB as a cleaner route to p-CAN. We have established exclusive formation of p-CAN (at 393K and atmospheric pressure) for reaction over Ni supported on Al2O3, SiO2, activated carbon (AC) and graphite in continuous gas flow operation. Our results can provide the basis for the development of a clean high throughput route for the production of p-CAN."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The SiO2 (fumed) and Al2O3 supports were supplied by Sigma–Aldrich and used as received. The AC (G-60, 100mesh) was obtained from NORIT (UK) and the graphite (synthetic 1–2μm powder) from Sigma–Aldrich. The Ni-loaded samples were prepared by impregnation where a 2-butanolic Ni(NO3)2 solution (0.6cm3 g−1) was added drop wise at 353K to the substrate with constant agitation (500rpm). The impregnated samples were oven dried at 393K for 12h. The Ni content (accurate to within ±2%) was measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Vista-PRO, Varian Inc.) from the diluted extract in HF. A Pd/Al2O3 catalyst also prepared by impregnation was examined for comparative purposes. Prior to use in catalysis, the catalyst precursors were sieved (ATM fine test sieves) into a batch of 75μm average particle diameter."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization BET surface area, temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and H2 chemisorption were determined using the commercial CHEM-BET 3000 (Quantachrome) unit. The samples were loaded into a U-shaped Pyrex glass cell (10cm×3.76mm i.d.) and heated in 17cm3 min−1 (Brooks mass flow controlled) 5% (v/v) H2/N2 at 10Kmin−1 and 2Kmin−1 to a final temperature of 523K and 723K for Pd/Al2O3 and supported Ni, respectively. The effluent gas passed through a liquid N2 trap and changes in H2 consumption were monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with data acquisition/manipulation using the TPR Win™ software. The reduced samples were maintained at the final reduction temperature for 1h in a constant flow of H2, swept with a 65cm3 min−1 flow of N2 for 1.5h, cooled to room temperature and subjected to H2 chemisorption using a pulse (50μl) titration procedure. After H2 chemisorption the supported Ni samples were reoxidised in air (17cm3 min−1) and subjected to a second TPR step, conditions as above. BET areas were recorded with a 30% (v/v) N2/He flow; pure N2 (99.9%) served as the internal standard. At least 2 cycles of nitrogen adsorption-desorption in the flow mode were employed to determine total surface area using the standard single point method. BET surface area and H2 uptake values were reproducible to within ±5% and the values quoted in this paper are the mean. XRD analysis (recorded on a Philips X’Pert instrument using nickel filtered Cu Kα radiation) established that the supported Ni and Pd phases exhibit an exclusive cubic symmetry: peaks at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.3° for Ni corresponding to (111), (200) and (220) planes; peaks at 40.1°, 46.7°, 68.1°, and 82.15° for Pd corresponding to (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes. Supported metal particle size was determined by transmission electron microscopy: JEOL 2000 TEM microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200kV. The catalyst samples were dispersed in 1-butanol by ultrasonic vibration, deposited on a lacey-carbon/Cu grid (300Mesh) and dried at 383K for 12h. At least 600 individual metal particles were counted for each catalyst and the surface area-weighted metal diameter ( d ¯ s ) was calculated from (1) d ¯ s = ∑ i n i d i 3 ∑ i n i d i 2 where n i is the number of particles of diameter d i ."
4,Catalysis procedure,"2.3 Catalysis procedure Reactions were carried out under atmospheric pressure, in situ immediately after activation, in a fixed bed vertical plug-flow glass reactor (l =60cm, i.d.=15mm) at T = 393K. The catalytic reactor, and operating conditions to ensure negligible heat/mass transport limitations, have been fully described elsewhere [34,37,38] but some features, pertinent to this study, are given below. A layer of borosilicate glass balls served as a preheating zone, ensuring that the reactant was vaporised and reached the reaction temperature before contacting the catalyst. Isothermal conditions (±1K) were ensured by diluting the catalyst bed with ground glass (75μm). Reaction temperature was continuously monitored by a thermocouple inserted in a thermowell within the catalyst bed. The reactant was delivered to the reactor via a glass/Teflon air-tight syringe and Teflon line using a microprocessor controlled infusion pump (Model 100kd Scientific) at a fixed calibrated flow rate. A co-current flow of aromatic and ultra pure H2 was maintained at a GHSV=2×104 h−1 with an inlet aromatic molar flow=0.4mmolh−1, where the H2 content was up to 95 times in excess of the stoichiometric requirement, the flow rate of which was monitored using a Humonics (Model 520) digital flowmeter. The molar metal (n Ni or n Pd) to inlet molar aromatic feed rate (F) spanned the range 3×10−3 h to 136×10−3 h. In a series of blank tests, passage of each reactant in a stream of H2 through the empty reactor or over the support alone did not result in any detectable conversion. The reactor effluent was frozen in a liquid nitrogen trap for subsequent analysis which was made using a Perkin-Elmer Auto System XL chromatograph equipped with a programmed split/splitless injector and a flame ionization detector, employing a DB-1 50m×0.20mm i.d., 0.33μm film thickness capillary column (J&W Scientific), as described in detail elsewhere [39]. A halogen (in the form of HX) mass balance was performed by passing the effluent gas through an aqueous NaOH trap (7.0×10−4 moldm−3, kept under constant agitation at 400rpm) with independent pH (Hanna HI Programmable Printing pH Bench-Meter) analysis. Repeated (up to five separate) catalytic runs with different samples from the same batch of catalyst delivered product compositions that were reproducible to within ±8%. p-CNB (Aldrich, ≥99.9%, w/w purity), p-BNB (Aldrich, 99%, w/w purity) NB (Fluka, >99.0%, v/v), CB (Sigma–Aldrich, 99.0%, v/v), p-CAN (Aldrich, ≥+99.0%, w/w), o-CNB (Fluka, >99.0%, w/w), m-CNB (Fluka, >98.0%, w/w) and the solvents (propanol: Aldrich, 99.7%, v/v, butanol: Riedel-de Haen, ≥99.5%, v/v; pentanol: Fluka,>98.0%, v/v and hexanol: Aldrich, 98.0%, v/v) were used without further purification."
5,Result and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The metal loading, BET surface area, H2 chemisorption uptake and mean metal particle size for the catalysts used in this study are given in Table 1 . We have chosen a similar metal loading (6±2%, w/w) on an array of supports, ranging from conventional Al2O3 and SiO2 to high surface area activated carbon and low surface area graphite with which to assess p-CNB hydrogenation activity/selectivity response. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles generated for Ni/Al2O3 (Ia), Ni/SiO2 (IIa), Ni/Graphite (IIIa), Ni/AC (IVa) and Pd/Al2O3 (V) can be compared in Fig. 2 , which also includes the TPR responses for the reoxidised supported Ni catalysts (profiles Ib–IVb). Hydrogen consumption during the initial TPR exceeded (by a factor of 1.1–1.5) that estimated for the reduction of the supported precursor. This “over consumption” may be attributable to hydrogen spillover during TPR as has been established previously [40,41]. The characteristic temperatures (T max) for maximum H2 consumption are recorded in Table 1; the TPR conditions match those used for actual catalyst activation prior to reaction. The TPR profiles associated with the direct reduction of the supported Ni catalysts are characterised by a sharp H2 consumption peak with a secondary higher temperature peak and a subsequent return to baseline. A similar two stage reduction of nickel has been reported elsewhere for oxide [32,42] and carbon [43,44] supported systems where differences in TPR T max values result from metal/support effects [45,46]. The principal TPR peak (T max =559–595K) recorded in this study can be attributed to the decomposition of nickel nitrate to NiO with a subsequent reduction of NiO to Ni0 responsible for the higher T max peak. González-Marcos et al. [47], studying an impregnated (5%, w/w) Ni/SiO2, correlated their single H2 consumption peak at 601K to Ni(NO3)2 decomposition while Rynkowski et al. [48] and Diaz et al. [49] ascribed TPR peaks at ca. 723K (5%, w/w Ni/SiO2) and 651K (15%, w/w Ni/SiO2), respectively, to NiO reduction. It is notable that the second TPR peak for Ni/Al2O3 extends into the final isothermal hold, which we take to be indicative of a stronger NiO/support interaction [50]. Zaki [51] proposed the presence of partially electron-deficient Ni species that exhibit strong electronic interaction with Al2O3. TPR of the reoxidised samples generated a single reduction peak where the significantly higher T max (490K) for Ni/Al2O3 (profile Ib) provides further evidence for a stronger Ni–Al2O3 interaction. The TPR profile for Pd/Al2O3 is characterized by a sharp negative peak (at 377K) with an ill-defined (positive) H2 consumption at 523K. The negative peak can be attributed to H2 release resulting from β-Pd hydride decomposition [52–57]. Palladium hydride formation is known to occur at room temperature when the H2 partial pressure exceeds 0.013atm [58]; room temperature Pd precursor reduction to zero valent Pd has been established elsewhere [59–61]. The occurrence of H2 consumption at 523K suggests a secondary reduction of the Pd precursor that is stabilised to some degree by the Al2O3 support [61,62]. Based on the TPR analysis, the final reduction temperatures for supported Ni and Pd/Al2O3 were set at 723K and 523K, respectively. Representative TEM images are presented in Fig. 3 and illustrate metal dispersion and particle morphology. A range of Ni particle sizes is in evidence with a surface area weighted mean Ni particle size that is larger for the carbon relative to the oxide supported systems (Table 1). Previous studies [63,64] have revealed that supported Ni catalysts prepared by Ni(NO3)2 impregnation exhibit a wide size distribution post TPR when compared with preparation by the more controlled deposition–precipitation route, which generates smaller average Ni particle diameters. It should be noted that Ni/Al2O3, which bore the smallest mean Ni particle size and should accordingly exhibit the highest H2 uptake, actually delivered the lowest chemisorption value (Table 1). We tentatively attribute this to metal–support interaction(s) that result(s) in suppressed H2 uptake but this effect is not without precedent. Hoang-Van et al. [65] reported smaller Ni particle sizes associated with Al2O3 as support when compared with SiO2 and TiO2 where a strong metal–support interaction caused a decrease in hydrogen chemisorption. A similar inhibition of H2 uptake on Ni/Al2O3 was observed by Bartholomew et al. [66]. In addition, Ding et al. [67] using Ni/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by co-precipitation and impregnation reported a suppression of H2 chemisorption on smaller metal particles and attributed this to stronger metal–support interaction. The smaller mean Pd particle size recorded in Table 1 can be ascribed, at least in part, to a lower reduction temperature [57]."
7,Catalyst activity/selectivity,"3.2 Catalyst activity/selectivity Hydrogenation of p-CNB at 393K over supported Ni generated p-CAN as the only product with no evidence of dechlorination or ring reduction. Fractional p-CNB conversion (x p-CNB) is illustrated as a function of time-on-stream for two representative cases in Fig. 4 where the temporal drop in activity can be expressed in terms of the empirical relationship [32,68] (2) x p -CNB − x 0 x 5 h − x 0 = Δ t β + Δ t where x 5h represents fractional conversion after 5h on-stream and β is a time scale fitting parameter. Fit convergence yields values for x 0, the initial fractional conversion. A pseudo-first order kinetic treatment has been applied previously [32,34] for the catalytic hydrodehalogenation of haloarenes under plug-flow conditions where hydrogen was maintained far in excess; the following reactor/kinetic expression applies (3) ln ( 1 − x 0 ) − 1 = k n Ni F The parameter F is the inlet hourly molar p-CNB feed rate and n Ni represents moles of Ni in the catalyst bed; n Ni/F has the physical significance of contact time. The linear relationships between ln(1− x 0)−1 and n Ni/F, shown in Fig. 5 , confirm the applicability of pseudo-first order kinetics. The extracted pseudo-first order rate constants for the supported Ni catalysts are presented in Table 2 , where the following activity sequence is established: Ni/Al2O3 >Ni/SiO2 >Ni/Activated Carbon>Ni/Graphite. Converting the raw pseudo-first order rate constants to specific rates, Ni/Al2O3 (19×10−3 mol p-CNB h−1 mNi −2) delivered a greater than threefold higher specific activity compared with Ni/Graphite (6×10−3 mol p-CNB h−1 mNi −2), indicative of a support effect. The latter may be manifested in variations of mean Ni size (and size distribution), electronic interactions which impact on Ni site electron density and possible reactant activation. In liquid phase reactions, Kratky and co-workers [13] have observed that CNB reduction is sensitive to the nature of the support and metal particle size. Han et al. [22], using a series of oxide (TiO2, γ-Al2O3 and ZrO2) supported Pt catalysts, ascribed the highest p-CAN yield delivered by Pt/TiO2 to strong metal/support interactions. Xiong et al. [69] attributed a higher hydrogenation rate over Ni/TiO2, when compared with Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/SiO2, to a polarization of the NO bond induced by oxygen vacancies associated with TiO x . A similar support effect was proposed by Coq et al. for the enhancement of activity and selectivity to p-CAN over a series of supported Pt catalysts [25]. The same group also reported that p-CAN selectivity is sensitive to metal dispersion where p-CAN exhibited a lower adsorption strength relative to p-CNB on larger Al2O3 supported Pt particles (1–12nm) [7]. In our study, Pd/Al2O3 exhibited a higher overall activity, a response that is expected based on the available literature on liquid phase systems but which is explicitly established here for gas phase reaction. However, reaction over Pd/Al2O3 generated NB as the predominant product with a secondary AN formation (see Table 2), i.e. path (VI) (see Fig. 1) was preferred where C–Cl hydrogen scission and subsequent –NO2 reduction prevailed. Significant hydrodehalogenation activity has, however, been established for supported Pd with specific rates that were higher by up to three orders of magnitude compared with supported Ni catalysts [34]. The Ni/Al2O3 sample was adopted as a model catalyst to assess halo/nitro-arene reactivity and probe selectivity responses; the results are given in Table 2. Conversion of chlorobenzene (CB) generated benzene (BZ) as the sole product, i.e. 100% selectivity with respect to hydrodechlorination but at an appreciably lower (by a factor of 25) rate when compared with that recorded for the p-CNB reaction. The exclusivity in terms of p-CNB→ p-CAN over supported Ni must result from a more facile reduction of the nitro group. Indeed, Ni/Al2O3 also exhibited 100% selectivity in terms of –NO2 reduction for the conversion of NB (to AN) where the rate constant ratio for selective –NO2 reduction (NB→AN) relative to C–Cl hydrogenolysis (CB→BZ) approached 60. It is significant that there was a greater than twofold increase in NB hydrogenation rate relative to the conversion of p-CNB, i.e. the Cl substituent has a deactivating effect. In contrast, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups has been found to result in higher hydrogenation activity in liquid phase applications, which was taken to be consistent with the involvement of a negatively charged intermediate [70]. In our study, under the same reaction conditions p-CAN underwent hydrogenolytic cleavage of the –Cl or –NH2 substituents to generate AN and CB with no evidence of BZ formation. The higher selectivity to AN suggests that p-CAN conversion preferably followed Path VII over Path VIII (Fig. 1), i.e. aromatic dechlorination is favoured over deamination. Reaction exclusivity also extends to the hydrogenation of p-bromonitrobenzene (p-BNB) where p-bromoaniline (p-BAN) was formed with 100% selectivity but at a lower rate than the p-CNB reaction, suggesting a greater deactivating effect by the Br substituent. The hydrogenation of both ortho- and meta-CNB isomers was also 100% selective with respect to the corresponding haloaniline isomer with no obvious dependency of rate on isomer structure (Table 2). Steric hindrance has been reported to result in a significantly lower conversion of o-CNB in batch liquid phase operation [13,18,23]. The aromatic feed was introduced to the reactor as an alcohol solution and subsequently vaporised before contacting the catalyst. Exclusive selectivity in terms of –NO2 group reduction was maintained with no appreciable dependence of rate on the nature of the alcohol solvent, albeit there was a measurable drop in activity in going from butanol/propanol to hexanol. In gas phase hydrogenation, solvent effects have been attributed to a competitive adsorption of solvent and reactant on the catalyst surface [71,72]. In this instance, the alcohol solvent served as a carrier and did not have a major involvement in determining reaction rate. However, significant solvent effects have been noted for the liquid phase hydrogenation of p-CNB [10,15,18] with higher conversions established with increasing solvent (alcohol) polarity [9]. The temporal plots given in Fig. 4 reveal a short term decline in fractional conversion. The catalyst exhibited a continual decline in activity with extended reaction times but the exclusive formation of p-CAN was maintained to ultimately deliver a production of 40g p-CAN gNi −1 after 9h on-stream. Work is now underway to identify the source of the catalyst deactivation and to assess the viability of catalyst regeneration and alternative catalyst formulations that will deliver time invariant activity while maintaining the product exclusivity that we report here."
8,Conclusions,"We have established that oxide and carbon supported Ni (6±2%, w/w) promote the hydrogenation of p-CNB to p-CAN with 100% selectivity in gas phase continuous operation under mild reaction conditions (393K and 1atm). A support effect is established where Ni/Al2O3 delivered the highest specific reaction rate; activity increased in the order Ni/Graphite<Ni/Activated Carbon<Ni/SiO2 <Ni/Al2O3. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst required a higher reduction temperature, exhibited suppressed H2 uptake and, on the basis of TEM analysis, bore a smaller mean Ni particle diameter, effects that we attribute to stronger Ni/support interactions. While Pd/Al2O3 was significantly more active, it generated NB as the principal product (via hydrodechlorination) with subsequent hydrogenation to give AN as a secondary product. Reaction exclusivity in terms of –NO2 reduction over supported Ni extends to CNB isomers and the conversion of a brominated analogue. The aromatic ring halogen substituent has a deactivating effect which serves to lower –NO2 reduction. These results demonstrate for the first time the viability of continuous gas phase catalytic hydrogenation of p-CNB for the direct (and clean) production of p-CAN. However, the catalysts suffer time on-stream loss of activity (while still retaining exclusive selectivity), an effect that will be the subject of future research."
