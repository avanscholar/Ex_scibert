0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has been recognized as a promising energy carrier which is clean and sustainable [1,2]. Recently, fermentative hydrogen production has gained considerable attention because of its potential advantages of energy-saving and environment-friendliness [3,4]. Many approaches, such as isolation of high hydrogen-producing bacteria, optimization of reactor operations, development of two-stage processes, immobilization of whole cells and metabolic engineering have already been carried out to affect hydrogen production [5–7]. It has been conformed that a high hydrogen-producing bacterium is of the most importance for bio-hydrogen system [8]. Therefore, more researches have been focused on finding the hydrogen-producing cultures with highest efficiency of hydrogen production. Many studies have been reported to isolate fermentative hydrogen-producing bacteria from various environments such as landfill, sewage sludge, pond, mangrove sludge, etc [9–11]. Some high efficient fermentative hydrogen production bacteria, such as, Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 [12], Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08 [13], Enterobacter aerogenes [14,15], Ethanoligenens harbinense YUAN-3 [16] have been isolated. However, for the reason of low hydrogen production, fermentative bacteria could not be applied to industrial hydrogen production until now. To enhance the hydrogen production efficiency, modification of bacteria of higher production hydrogen ability by molecular biology means is necessary [17–20]. Classically, transposon mutagenesis has proven to be an excellent tool in bacterial genetic research and becomes a preferable method to mutate the microorganisms [21]. In this study, a Tn7-based transposon was randomly inserted into genomic DNA of Pantoea agglomerans BH18. The in vitro reaction produced a population of target DNA molecules each containing the transposable element at a different position and generation of insertion mutants. The generation of a transposon-mutagenized library was used to isolate for high hydrogen-producing mutants. Biological process for hydrogen production in fresh condition had been well developed [22]. In the recent years, fermentative hydrogen production by biological treatment from the marine wastewater has been attracting more attention [23]. Some reports were found on fermentative hydrogen production by some marine fermentative hydrogen production bacteria, such as P. agglomerans BH18, Bacillus sp.B2, Clostridium amygdalinum C9, E. aerogenes HGN-2 and HT 34 [8,11,24,25]. These works mainly focused on optimizing the efficiency of fermentative hydrogen production with different pH, temperature, NaCl concentrations and different substrate concentrations. However, few studies were found to work on the improvement of hydrogen production of the hydrogen producing bacteria from marine environments by molecular biology method. In this work, P. agglomerans BH18, which we previously isolated from marine environment, was transformed by transposome technology to improve hydrogen production ability. The generation and characterization of a transposon-mutagenized P. agglomerans BH18 library was analyzed. A mutant strain with high hydrogen-producing ability was screened and named as mutant strain TB212. The properties of growth and hydrogen production for the wild type strain and the transposon mutant were compared. Further characterization of the mutant will help provide a better understanding of the hydrogen-producing mechanism through identifying the genetic determinants of hydrogen production of P. agglomerans BH18."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Strain and culture growth,"2.1 Strain and culture growth LM-H medium that was used in this study has been described in previous work on P. agglomerans BH18 culture [11], which glucose at the concentration of 20 g/l was used as carbon source. The cells were grown under anaerobic conditions and incubated at 37 °C with a shaking speed of 120 rpm."
3,In vitro transposition,"2.2 In vitro transposition P. agglomerans BH18 was grown in an anaerobic 150 ml serum bottle (working volume 100 ml) at 37 °C with a shaking speed of 120 rpm for 24 h. 10 ml culture broth was centrifuged at 2500 g for 5 min at 4 °C, followed by washing the pellets with sterile distilled water. The genomic DNA was extracted from cell pellets as described by Pitcher et al. [26]. Pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of TE buffer (pH 8.0) supplemented with 25 μg/ml lysozyme incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After addition of 1 μl 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and incubation at 60 °C for 30 min, the solution became viscous and clear. The aqueous layers were separated by centrifugation and extracted with chloroform isoamyl alcohol (25:1, v/v). After the RNase treatment, the DNA was recovered with phenol and chloroform. To precipitate the DNA, 0.1 volume of 3 mol/l sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 3.0 volume of ethanol were added. The pellet containing the genomic DNA was washed once with 70% ethanol, dissolved in 30 μl of TE buffer (pH 8.0) and stored at −20 °C until used. DNA purity was measured via determination of the 260/280 nm ratio. Transposition was performed using the GPS-mutagenesis system (New England Biolabs catalog NO E7101S) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transprimer donor supplied with the kit, pGPS3, carries kanamycin resistance. The 20 μl in vitro transposition reaction mixture contained: 2 μl 10 × GPS buffer, 1 μl pGPS3, 1 μl (0.08 μg) genomic DNA, 1 μl TnsABC transposase, 15 μl dH2O. The above reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and the ligation was performed at 16 °C for 4 h. The final reaction mixture components (5 μl 10 × PI-SceⅠbuffer, 0.5 μl BSA, 18.5 μl dH2O, 6 μl PI-SceⅠ (VDE) (6U)) were then added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by phenolchloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and the DNA was resuspended in 15 μl dH2O."
4,Mutagenesis,"2.3 Mutagenesis P. agglomerans BH18 was grown in LM-H medium for 24 h. 1 ml culture broth was inoculated into experiment culture using YT medium. The inoculum rate was 2%. The composition of YT medium contained yeast extract 10 g/l, trytone 16 g/l and NaCl 4 g/l. P. agglomerans BH18 was cultivated in 50 ml of YT medium for 2 days at 18 °C with shaking of 100 rpm, and grown to OD600 of 0.4–0.6. The cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold water and once with a solution of 10 mmol/l TE pH 7.0 and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Then, 40 μl aliquots of the cells were frozen and stored at −80 °C until used. Mutagenesis was carried out according to the method reported by Paul et al. [21] with slight modification. 40 μl electro-competent cells were transformed with 1 μl of transposome complex (0.2 μg of DNA) using a 2 mm gap cuvette at 1.8 kV. The cells were quickly resuspended in 1 ml of SOC medium, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and plated on LB agar plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin sulfates. Colonies containing the insertion were visible after 2 days of growth. Transposition frequency was determined by counting the number of colony forming units (cfu). Cell suspension with volume of 200 μl was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Transformed cell culture was diluted to 10, 100 and 1000 times, respectively. Diluent (40 μl) was plated on LB agar plates containing kanamycin sulfates (50 μg/ml). Transposition frequency was calculated as the product of the number of colony forming units and dilution divided by volume of coating liquid. The formula is: (number of colony forming units × dilution)/volume of coating liquid."
5,Cloning of transposon insertions,"2.4 Cloning of transposon insertions Genomic DNA of each colony was extracted as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the insertion fragment. The presence of the transposon was confirmed by performing a transposon-specific PCR (primer TnL: TTAAGGATTATTTAGGGAAG; TnR: ACAATAAAGTCTTAAAC). Each PCR mixture (total volume, 50 μl) consisted of 5 μl of 10 × PCR buffer, 1 μl of each primer (10 μmol/l), 1 μl of dNTP (10 mmol/l), 1 μl of Taq polymerase (5 U/l), and l μl of DNA template and the adequate amount of distilled water added to reach the desired volume. A PCR was performed under conditions of initial denaturation of DNA for 4 min at 94 °C; 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 49 °C, 30 s at 72 °C and extension of incomplete products for 10 min at 72 °C, yielding a 1699 bp amplification fragment. This 1699 bp fragment was verified for the generated transposon insertion."
6,Screen for kanamycin resistant mutants,"2.5 Screen for kanamycin resistant mutants These colonies were washed off with LB medium and plated on LB agar plates supplemented 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 100 μg/ml kanamycin sulfates, to identify the limiting kanamycin concentration. Wild type strain P. agglomerans BH18 was used as control. The optimum kanamycin concentration that transformed cells could grow, but P. agglomerans BH18 could not, was used to screen mutants. Each colony was harvested aseptically with a cotton swab in 500 μl of LM-H medium. The growth of kanamycin resistant mutants and wild type P. agglomerans BH18 was determined by optical density at 600 nm. Stability of the insert was tested using the method reported by Paul et al. [21] with slight modification. At the end of hydrogen producing process, 1 ml of cell suspension was transferred into another 150 ml serum bottles (working volume 100 ml LM-H medium without kanamycin selection). After 12 h incubation, 1 ml culture broth was inoculated again using the same medium. After five times of subculture, a small aliquot of cells was plated onto plates with or without kanamycin sulfates to test for kanamycin resistance."
7,Analytical method,"2.6 Analytical method The hydrogen production was determined using a gas chromatograph (Model 6820 Agilent, China) as described previously in Ref. [23]. In detail, the chromatograph was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2-m-long column packed with 5 A molecular sieves (60/80 mesh). Nitrogen was used as the carry gas at 30 ml/min. The oven, injector and detector were kept at 40, 200 and 200 °C, respectively. The organic acids and ethanol in the culture broth were analyzed by gas chromatography (Model 6820 Agilent, China) using a flame ionization detector (FID) according to the same method as described previously in Ref. [23]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Construction of a transposon-insertion library of P. agglomerans BH18,"3.1 Construction of a transposon-insertion library of P. agglomerans BH18 A Tn7-based transposon was randomly inserted into the DNA target by TnsABC transposase, and then the transposome complex was introduced into P. agglomerans BH18 by electroporation. The cells were plated on LB plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin sulfates. The mutants grew to visible single colonies two days. Approximate 300 kanamycin resistance colonies were isolated after one electroporation. Transposition frequency was approximately 1.0 × 105 cfu/ml. Kanamycin resistant transposon mutants were identified by amplification of the inserted sequences. The presence of the transposon in the kanamycin resistant colonies was verified by PCR amplification of the transposon from DNA isolated from the mutants using transposon specific primers. Sixteen randomly mutagenized colonies were selected as template, in which the PCR products carrying the transposon insertion were all around 1699 bp (Fig. 1 ), conforming that the transposon had integrated into the chromosome."
10,Isolation of mutants of high hydrogen-producing ability,"3.2 Isolation of mutants of high hydrogen-producing ability Hydrogen production capacity among these over 300 mutants was tested by batch fermentation. Finally, six mutants that increased hydrogen production over 30% compared with that of wild type strain were isolated. To test the stability of hydrogen-production of these six mutants, the cells were inoculated for five consecutive passages and grown to produce hydrogen. The specific amount of evolved gas and hydrogen content of these six mutants were shown in Table 1 . The final hydrogen production was calculated according to the product of the amount and hydrogen content of evolved gas. Of these, mutant strain TB212 was found as an effective hydrogen producer with hydrogen content and the maximum hydrogen production of 63.25 ± 3.91% and 2.52 ± 0.02 mol H2/mol glucose, respectively, at an initial glucose concentration of 20 g/l and a pH value of 7.0 under marine culture condition. Relative to P. agglomerans BH18, the hydrogen yield of mutant strain TB212 increased by 60%. After five times of subculture, mutant strain TB212 was plated on LM-H medium with or without kanamycin to test the stability of the transposition event. The results indicated that kanamycin resistance of mutant strain TB212 was maintained in all cases. It meant that transposon insertion had been stably integrated into the P. agglomerans BH18 genome DNA."
11,The growth of wild type and mutant strain TB212,"3.3 The growth of wild type and mutant strain TB212 As shown in Fig. 2 , the growth of mutant TB212 and wild type P. agglomerans BH18 was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm at certain time intervals. The results demonstrated that the cells of wild type and mutant TB212 grew logarithmically after 9 and 12 h, arriving at the stationary phase at 15 and 18 h respectively. Moreover, the wild type cells reached relatively higher absorbance values (OD600 = 1.92 ± 0.07) compared to mutant strain (OD600 = 1.48 ± 0.04). The growth rates of genetically engineered mutants usually decrease compared with wild type [27]. For wild type cells, the evolution of hydrogen started at 13 h, with the maximum hydrogen production rate from 15 to 18 h, and stopped at 24 h. For mutant strain TB212, The evolution of hydrogen appeared to start when cell growth entered the late exponential phase (15 h), whereas the hydrogen production speed reached a maximum from18 to 24 h. Compared with the wild type, mutant TB212 showed slower growth. The total hydrogen accumulation in mutant cells was 60% higher than that in wild type cells. The phenomenon that increased hydrogen production was consistent with the reduced cell growth was similar with the report of Clostridium butyricum CGS5 [9]. This may be due to fact that hydrogen generation was not preferable to the biomass accumulation [11]. The pH changes during the growth of mutant and wild type cells were monitored and illustrated in Fig. 2. The initial pH was buffered to 7.2 and was not controlled during the growth. The final pH values of wild type and mutant TB212 were 3.8 and 3.6 respectively. Due to the accumulation of various organic acids, decrease of pH in the culture medium during the process was inevitable. If the levels of organic acids produced were insufficient to cause dramatic lowering of pH, the bacteria could produce hydrogen gradually at a moderate rate with the adaptation at a lower pH [28]."
12,Characterization of hydrogen production of wild type and mutant strain TB212,"3.4 Characterization of hydrogen production of wild type and mutant strain TB212 The effect of initial pH value on hydrogen production of mutant and wild type P. agglomerans BH18 was shown in Fig. 3 . P. agglomerans BH18 and the mutant strain TB212 could produce hydrogen at a wide range of initial pH 5–10. Some hydrogen-producing strains could not grow and produce hydrogen at pH of 5.0 [9,29,30]. In this case, wild type strain BH18 and the mutant strain TB212 were able to grow at acidic condition of pH 5.0, indicating that the bacteria were aciduric facultative anaerobe. It might be a cost-effective hydrogen production process. Within certain range, increasing pH led to an enhancement in hydrogen production. However, excessively high pH decreased hydrogen production. The result was consisted with the studies revealed that too low or high initial pH could cause the yield of hydrogen production decreasing [31]. pH is an important factor that influences fermentative hydrogen production, because it affects the hydrogenase activity as well as the metabolic pathway [32]. Fig. 3 showed that optimal pH for hydrogen production of wild type and the mutant strain TB212 was 6.0 and 7.0 respectively. The maximum for hydrogen production yield was 1.68 ± 0.04 mol H2/mol glucose (mean ± S.E.) at pH 6.0, whereas that of 2.52 ± 0.02 mol H2/mol glucose (mean ± S.E.) with an optimum initial pH of 7.0 for mutant strains TB212. The maximum hydrogen production of the mutant was obviously higher than that of wild type strain. Meanwhile, the concentration of volatile fatty acids and ethanol were needed for further understanding the metabolic pathway related with hydrogen production of these bacteria. According to the gas chromatography analysis, the result showed that ethanol and acetate were the major soluble production for P. agglomerans BH18 and the mutant TB212. Specifically, for wild type strain BH18, acetate constituted 56% of the soluble production and became the major soluble production at optimum initial pH of 6.0. Ethanol was the major soluble production (62%) at optimum initial pH of 7.0 for mutant strain TB212. These results conformed the hypothesis that the optimal pH and the metabolism changed between the wild type and the mutant. The concentration of ethanol in mutant strain TB212 was higher than that in wild type strain. Compared with the acetate production, as neutral product, the higher ethanol yield decreased the limitation of low pH for hydrogen production. Thus, it is likely that the mutant strain TB212 efficiently overcame the organic acid inhibition and improved acid tolerance, resulting in a higher specific hydrogen production. Salt tolerance is an important parameter for evaluation of hydrogen production of marine strains. Fig. 4 shows the effects of salt concentrations on cell growth and hydrogen production of wild and mutant strain TB212. The results indicated that in marine condition (at the salt concentration 3–6%), the average hydrogen production yield of the wild type strain was 1.09 ± 0.08 mol H2/mol glucose at an initial glucose concentration of 20 g/l, whereas it increased by 23% for the mutant strain TB212. The growth and hydrogen production of mutant strain TB212 under 7% salt concentration culture decreased drastically and were weaker than that of wild type strain BH18. The mutant strain TB212 basically maintained salt-tolerance feature from the wild type strain and effectively improve the hydrogen production capacity."
13,Conclusions,"Transposon mutagenesis was utilized to enhance the hydrogen production capacity of P. agglomerans BH18. A transposon mutagenesis library was constructed in this study. A mutant strain TB212 was studied for good heredity stability and higher hydrogen production ability. The maximum hydrogen production evolved by this mutant strain TB212, 2.52 ± 0.02 mol H2/mol glucose (mean ± S.E.), was 60% higher than that of the wild type. The mutant TB212 could produce hydrogen at pH and salt concentration ranges tested. Our study provided the evidence that transposon mutagenesis of P. agglomerans BH18 was an efficient method to obtain mutant strain with high efficiency hydrogen-producing ability."
