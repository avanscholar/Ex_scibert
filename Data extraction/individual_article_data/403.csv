0,Introduction,"Constantly growing energy demands combined with depletion of fossil fuel reserves and environmental pollution have become major global challenges in recent years. It is estimated that global energy consumption has increased by 1.7 % annually over the past 10 years, reaching up to 17.9 TW in 2017. This value is estimated to grow even further up to 22 TW by 2030 [1]. As fossil fuels are supposed to cover up nearly 80 % of this energy in the evolving scenario, CO2 emission into the atmosphere is also predicted to grow over the next decades. Strong reliance of global economy on fossil fuels has raised significant concerns regarding the sustainability and environmental impact of modern-day energy production. Amongst all available options, the limitless renewable energy resource is provided by Sun. The average amount of energy supply from the Sun to the Earth’s surface on a daily basis is about 1022 J, covering up the annual global demands for energy [2]. Therefore, solar energy has the greatest potential to meet future energy demands, assuming sustainability and environmentally benign processing routes. Hydrogen is commonly regarded as the most promising future fuel and potentially an ideal energy carrier due to its highest gravimetric energy and zero emission of carbon dioxide [3]. When H2 and O2 are combined in a fuel cell, the chemical energy stored in the HH bond is released producing water only. Nevertheless, before our world can challenge the new energy scenario, there are several issues that have to be solved. Amongst them, the realization of an efficient H2 generation process that meets industrial expectations is the most essential step. Such a method should assure a long–term supply of H2 and take into account the environmental issues such as minimization or the entire elimination of any waste products, paying particular attention to CO2 or any other greenhouse gas. Even though hydrogen is the most abundant element on the earth, it does not exist as free molecules like oxygen. Therefore, it has to be produced from hydrogen–containing resources such as natural gas, coal, biomass and water by means of reforming, gasification, thermal decomposition, electrolysis or photolysis [4]. Currently, vast majority of H2 is produced from natural gas through the steam reforming of methane, a process followed by the water–gas shift reaction that uses the generated CO in the first step, in order to maximize the amount of H2. Nevertheless, this method cannot be considered sustainable due to the limited availability of fossil fuels and generation of CO2, which is a major greenhouse gas that contributes to the global warming effect. Most of the aforementioned methods require high temperatures and pressures, the application of an external bias or the utilization of non–renewable H2 source. Photocatalytic hydrogen production from water or organic solutions offers a renewable way for mitigating the global energy crisis by means of simultaneous H2 generation and wastewater remediation [5]. In particular, photocatalytic water splitting over a semiconductor surface has attracted significant attention due to the potential of this technology, as well as the great economic and environmental interest for the production of a clean H2 fuel directly from water using solar energy. In order to enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen generation, the application of sacrificial agents, i.e. organic compounds, in the photocatalytic system have been proposed. This process called photoreforming represents very attractive pathway for the removal of organic pollutants in wastewater with the simultaneous valorisation of these substances [6]. For this purpose, various organic compounds such as methanol, ethanol, sugar, glycerol, and lactic acid have been used [7]. Organic compounds act as sacrificial agents in the photocatalytic hydrogen production because these substances are capable of combining with the photo-generated holes localized in the valence band more effectively than water. Even the state-of-the-art photocatalysts for hydrogen production fade against heterogeneous catalysts for the steam reforming of methane, when it comes to efficiency and the cost of generated H2 per kg. This economical barrier undoubtedly suppresses large scale commercialisation of photoreforming technology. The main reason behind relatively low H2 photocatalytic production rate is poor quantum efficiency of photocatalyst in converting photons into fuel. The potential remedy for making the photoreforming or photocatalytic water splitting technologies economically attractive and, as a result, breaking the barrier for their industrial application is to combine the advantages of conventional thermal catalysis and highly efficient solar energy harvesting. Recent efforts in this field have been focused on the development of plasmonic thermophotocatalysts that are capable of efficient collection of photons and generating significant heat in the nanoscale regime. These fundamental features of plasmonic nanomaterials open up new avenue in sustainable hydrogen production by means of thermophotocatalysis. In this review, we demonstrate recent progress in the development of plasmonic nanomaterials and thermophotocatalytic technology for the purpose of sustainable hydrogen production. To briefly introduce the reader into plasmonicrelated phenomena, we begin with the physical background of localized surface plasmon resonance (section 1). Next, we discuss the main advantages of plasmonicdriven chemical transformations, paying particular attention to hydrogen generation (section 2), and shortly demonstrate the most commonly used theoretical tools for modelling of plasmonic effects and design of plasmonic nanomaterials (section 3). The section 4 is dedicated to the thermophotocatalyst structure engineering, where various types of plasmonic NPs morphologies are discussed. Further, we highlight the importance of meso-scale structure engineering of thermophotocatalysts and discuss the superiority of spray-drying and flame synthesis method (section 5). In section 6, we demonstrate recent achievements in hydrogen production efficiency for several plasmonic photocatalysts reported in literature. We introduce the idea of continuous-flow reactors for hydrogen production through plasmonic thermophotocatalysis (section 7) as an essential element of large-scale commercialisation of this technology in the future. Finally, we summarize the current challenges facing the field of hydrogen production by plasmonic thermophotocatalysis and the future perspectives for the successful industrial implementation of the thermophotocatalytic production of hydrogen on a large scale."
1,Physical foundation of localized surface plasmonic resonance,"Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is the resonant collective oscillation of free electrons (see Fig. 1 ), and is induced when the frequency of an incident electromagnetic field corresponds to natural frequency of surface electrons oscillating within the potential energy landscape of positively charged nuclei [8–10]. The LSPR produces large absorption and scattering cross sections as well as enormous enhancement of the electromagnetic field in close proximity to the surface of metallic nanostructures. In the case of particles significantly smaller than the wavelength of the incident light, the dipole approximation can be used to describe the particle–light interaction. Under this approximation, the oscillating electron induces an oscillating dipole moment that generates electromagnetic field [12]. To predict the conditions upon which the LSPR occurs for a given nanostructure, it is necessary to determine a complex dielectric function. The dielectric function itself can be derived from Drude–Lorentz model [13]: (1) ε ∼ b u l k ω = ε ∞ - ω p 2 ω 2 + i γ ∞ ω + ∑ j = 1 N f j ω 0 , j 2 ω 0 , j 2 - ω 2 - i Y j ω where ω 0 , j are the resonant frequencies, Y j is the damping coefficient, f j is the strength of j-th Lorentz term, ε ∞ is the permittivity at infinite frequency, and ω p is the so-called Drude term dependent on plasma energy: (2) ω p = E p ℏ = n e 2 ε 0 m * where n is the number density of conduction electrons, e is the elementary charge, ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, and m * is the effective mass of electron. Drude oscillator describes the electron excitations from occupied states below the Fermi level to unoccupied states within the same band (intraband transitions) upon photon absorption. Lorentz oscillators, in turn, describe electron excitations between two different bands (interband transitions). To account for nanoscale dimension of an object, for example nanoparticles (NPs) with radius R, the dielectric function can be expressed as [14]: (3) ε ∼ b u l k ω , R = ε ∼ b u l k ω + ω p 2 1 ω 2 + γ ∞ 2 - 1 ω 2 + γ 2 R + i ω p 2 ω 2 γ R ω 2 + γ ∞ 2 - γ ∞ ω 2 + γ 2 R where the damping factor γ R includes a surface scattering term: (4) γ R = γ ∞ + γ s u r f = γ ∞ + Λ ν F R where ν F denotes the Fermi velocity and Λ is a phenomenological constant. For the sake of simplicity, let us consider a small spherical NPs ( R ≪ λ ) for which the quasi-static approximation holds. The polarizability α shows a resonance when [14]: (5) ε 1 ω + 2 ε m 2 + ε 2 2 ω ≈ 0 where ε m denotes the permittivity of medium. Hence, one may expect the LSPR for such ω value that ε 1 ω ≈ - 2 ε m and ε 2 ω ≈ 0 . At the LSPR conditions, a sharp peak in the extinction cross section is produced: (6) σ e x t = σ a b s + σ s c a t ≈ ε 2 ω ε 1 ω + 2 ε m 2 + ε 2 2 ω where σ a b s and σ s c a t denote the absorption and scattering cross sections, respectively. The frequency of LSPR can be deduced from the following simple equation: (7) ω L S P R = ω p 1 + 2 ε m For larger particles, where the quasi-static approximation becomes highly inaccurate due to significant phase-changes of the driving field over the particle volume, a rigorous electrodynamics approach has to be applied. The extinction cross section for spherical NPs of arbitrary size as well as the size dependence of the resonant wavelength can be computed with the Mie theory [15]. When the NPs shape comes into play, finite element modelling (FEM) or finitedifference time-domain (FDTD) methods are usually used to solve Maxwell's equations and compute the electromagnetic field around the nanostructure [16]. It is now clear that LSPR frequency of a single metallic NP can be tuned through alterations in shape, size and the refractive index of the surrounding medium. Nevertheless, in the NPs’ clusters additional shifts of LSPR frequency can be distinguished due to electromagnetic interaction between the localized modes. The interaction is approximately dipolar in nature, so to the first approximation, the NPs’ clusters can be regarded as an array of interacting dipoles. Electromagnetic coupling of these arrays exhibits strong localization effects for closely separated particles, i.e. enhancement due to field localization in the NPs’ junctions. Taking into account a dipolar approximation, the NPs can be treated as point dipoles, and the NPs separated by a distance of ∼1 nm are described as an array of point dipoles interacting via their near-field. It has been demonstrated that under the resonance condition, the field enhancement f E = E / E 0 , with the amplitude of the incident electric field E 0 can approach 102–103 at the surface of an isolated particle, and 104–105 between two individual particles separated by ∼1 nm or less [9,17]. Such a space between two high-field-intensity plasmonic NPs is often called a hot spot [18]. Further enhancement of LSPR can be achieved by an engineered external cavity [19,20], for example, by using a semiconductormetal nanowire core&shell architecture that was designed to hydrogen production [21]. Upon LSPR excitation on plasmonic nanostructures, the coherent electron oscillation dephases nonradiatively, leading to the creation of hot electron-hole pairs through phonon-assisted absorption, interband absorption, electron − electron scattering-assisted absorption, or Landau damping process [11,22,23]. The hot carriers are initially in a non-thermal distribution but they rapidly thermalize to a Fermi − Dirac distribution through electron − electron and electron − phonon scatterings events within 100 fs – 1 ps (see Fig. 2 ), resulting in local heating (raising the lattice temperature) [11,22,23]. The typical energy of such carriers is about ±1 eV with respect to Fermi level, corresponding to an electronic temperature of thousands of K, which is not attainable by conventional heating [22]. The heat eventually dissipates to the environment by thermal conduction proportionally to ε 2 ω E I N 2 , where E I N denotes the electric field inside the material over longer timescales [11,24]. Is should be noted that these timescales could be slightly different for small NPs due to quantum confinement effects. Assuming that the energy of the incident light is utilized to heat the NPs, the reaction dynamics and the process by which the chemical reaction is driven would be identical to the process that takes place during the conventional heating of NPs. When the electron-accepting orbitals centred on a nearby adsorbate or semiconductor are accessible and their energy match the energy of the hot carriers, electrons can be injected from the plasmonic NPs into these species (see Fig. 2) [25]. Generally, there are two pathways for interfacial electron transfer, i.e. the conventional indirect transfer and the direct transfer proposed recently [11,26,27]. In case of indirect electron transfer, the electrons are injected either to the adsorbate or semiconductor after hot carrier generation. The indirect electron transfer must be sufficiently fast to compete with electron–electron and electron–phonon scattering events. Since vast majority of hot carriers have energy close to the Fermi level, the charge transfer will predominantly occur toward adsorbate states near the Fermi level. In the presence of strongly adsorbed molecules or adjacent semiconducting material, an additional dephasing channel, i.e. chemical interface damping (CID), can trigger the direct generation of hot electrons in the electron accepting orbitals of the adsorbate or semiconductor [11,23,27]. CID is induced by the coupling between hybridized unoccupied NPsadsorbate states and excited surface plasmons. This coupling modifies the natural dephasing mechanism and accelerates the overall plasmon dephasing process. As opposed to the indirect electron transfer that takes place after hot electron generation, direct electron transfer is completed during the plasmon dephasing [11]. Thus, as the indirect electron-transfer suffers from significant energy loss due to electron-electron scattering, the direct-electron-transfer is characterized by higher electrontransfer efficiency and lower energy loss [11,28]. The competition between thermalization, back-charge transfer and the charge transfer processes occurring at comparable time scales constitute major limitations for the efficient use of hot carriers in plasmonic photochemistry. These limitations have been partially mitigated by the application of hybrid plasmonicsemiconductor photocatalysts that can extend the lifetime of hot-carriers, diminishing electron- phonon scattering effects [29–31]. Although experimental evidence for non-thermal effects in LSPR reaction systems is constantly growing, difficulties in the assessment of temperature and the thermal gradients forming in the catalyst bed have initiated the discussion if the plasmonic enhancements can be purely explained as photothermal effects governed by standard Arrhenius expression. In 2018, Zhou et al. demonstrated the distinction between thermal and non-thermal effects contributing to the enhancement in ammonia decomposition reaction: N H 3 → 1 2 N 2 + 3 2 H 2 , Δ G f 0 = 16.4 k J m o l using Cu–Ru NPs supported on MgO antenna reactor [32]. The H2 production rate under 9.6 W/cm2 broadband light illumination without external heating was significantly higher in comparison to the experiments in the dark at 482 °C. By fitting the reaction rate to Arrhenius equation for different sets of light intensities and wavelengths, the authors were able to determine several values of activation energy under light illumination. Surprisingly, the activation energy value decreased to 0.27 eV in comparison to the value of 1.21 eV in the dark. Such an enormous reduction of the activation energy was associated with the activation of nitrogen atoms adsorbed on the Cu–Ru NPs and the subsequent desorption of N2 triggered by hot electrons injected to Ru atoms upon the LSPR decay on Cu. Sivan et al., however, published a critical comment on the reliability of the temperature measurement and the selection of the emissivity value for the Cu–Ru/MgO surface, which was taken from the literature rather than from FTIR spectroscopy measurement [33]. Another concern pointed out by authors was related to the positioning of the thermocouple (only one thermocouple T0 was used), resulting in 3–5% discrepancy in the temperature measured by the two instruments [33]. Due to the exponential dependence of Arrhenius law, even such a moderate 5% error in the temperature measurement would substantially impact the purely thermal reaction rate. As a result, Sivan et al. deduced that the activation energy do not depend upon the light intensity and they claimed that the results presented by Zhou et al. can be solely explained by thermal effects [34]. Finally, Zhou et al. responded to the comment published by Sivan et al., undermining the credibility of their conclusions [35]. According to the response, a substantial misinterpretation of the emissivity of the photocatalyst and assumption of a linear intensity–dependent temperature in the model is unrealistic."
2,LSPR-assisted photochemical hydrogen generation - a microscopic insight,"To understand how LSPR affects an overall performance of photocatalysts in hydrogen production, it is convenient to introduce the concept of the potential energy surface (PES), which describes the potential energy of the system as a function of reaction coordinates (see Fig. 3 ). Let us take as an example general chemical transformation of a given compound A into products B, where B contains the product of interest - hydrogen. Initial state corresponding to A and final state corresponding to B are represented by local minima on the PES (in general, one of them may be a global minimum of the entire system), that are separated by hills of various slopes and heights. Travelling on PES from A to B through the highest hill is equivalent to overcoming the activation barrier of the chemical reaction, which is referred as the rate-determining step (RDS). The RDS, in turn, dictates the kinetics of the reaction and essentially, the hydrogen generation efficiency. The major role of catalyst in the heterogeneous catalysis is modification of PES by reducing the activation barriers (in particular RDS); therefore, increasing the reaction rate and enhancing efficiency. From now on, we take as an example the hydrogen elimination (either from *CH, *OH or *NH radicals) as this is the RDS in vast majority of hydrogen generation reactions. In commercial processes, the chemical reactions (including hydrogen production) are initiated by the thermal heating of catalyst nanoparticles. Under thermal conditions, the excited phonon modes of the nanoparticles couple to the vibrational modes of the reacting species. As a result of this coupling, the adsorbate evolves from the reactant to the product state on the ground-state PES. Such reactions usually undergo at relatively high temperatures, and the products distribution is governed by the ground-state free-energy landscape. In general, pressure, temperature and reaction conditions have an impact on the adsorption − desorption dynamics, influencing the reaction evolution [37]. An alternative way of changing the reaction pathway is making use of the excited state electronic configurations of the adsorbate-catalyst system, where a new PES can be explored [10,38]. The new PES can be accessed by external stimulus such as light. This requires the excitation of charge carriers (electrons or holes) to the unoccupied orbitals centred on the adsorbate molecule, thereby formation of a transient ionic species. Upon electron population of higher lying molecular orbital, the charge density distribution is re-established, and as a result, forces are induced on atoms in the molecule. This short-living charge state can then undergo a chemical transformation on the new PES. In general, the activation barriers of the new electronically excited PES can be very different from those in the ground-state PES. Additionally, the excited PES may exhibit several minima states associated with different products for the same adsorbate-catalyst system that could potentially lead to product selectivity (see Fig. 3) [39]. Flattening the PES, in turn, reduces the activation barrier of the RDS, and increases the overall performance of the catalyst. As mentioned before, the excited electronic configuration of the adsorbate-catalyst system can be accessed by the absorption of a photon that subsequently excites an electron from the catalyst into the molecule, leading to the formation of charged species on the surface of the catalyst. In the surface science community, this charge-carriermediated mechanism is commonly known by its original name: desorption induced by electronic transitions (DIET) [9,36]. In these processes, the electronic charge transfer to the transient species occurs far from equilibrium in a nonthermal regime, within femtosecond time scale after light absorption at the adsorbate-catalyst interface [40]. There are many factors that affect the probability of this electronic transition, i.e. the energy of the incident photon, the absorption cross section of the adsorbate-catalyst system, the energy of the generated carriers, the energy possition and density of accessible electronic states in the system [41]. The main principle of phonon-driven reactions is the equilibrium between the vibrational temperature of the catalyst NP and the reactant. The charge-carrier-driven reaction, on the other hand, offers an opportunity to inject energy into an individual vibronic (coupled electronic-vibrational) state of the molecule, thereby selectively increasing the temperature of the specific vibrational mode rather than the phonon temperature of the NP or the temperature of other adsorbate vibrational modes. This drives the chemical reaction along the direction of this vibrational mode; therefore, providing an opportunity of product selectivity control through targeted design of nanostructures. Despite these exciting opportunities, the high-intensity light required on catalyst surfaces causes the charge-driven chemical transformations on metallic nanostructures irrelevant for practical applications. High-intensity light is necessary due to the fact that only a limited number of photons participate in the formation of chemically useful charge-carriers on the surfaces of photocatalyst. It is now obvious that LSPR-driven thermophotocatalytic sustainable production of hydrogen combines various advantages of phonon- and charge-carrier-driven processes. The extreme confinement of electric field in close proximity to plasmonic NPs and subsequent formation of plasmonic hot spots enable the light-induced heating of the nanostructure using lower intensity light source [42,43]. Such a plasmonic “nanofurnace” is capable of heating the local environment up to several hundreds of K, while the macroscopic temperature of the reacting system remains nearly unchanged. A direct consequence of this localized heating, apart from phonon-driven processes, is the increased local mass transfer due to formation of nanobubbles. Ultimately, the energy of hot carriers generated by LSPR can be significantly higher than the photogenerated excitons, providing a possibility of an electron injection into LUMO as well as higher lying vibronic states of the adsorbate, in particular, the antibonding orbitals localized on *CH, *OH or *NH species. Given the energy of such vibronic states in the adsorbate − catalyst system, one can theoretically tune the LSPR energy by rational design of plasmonic nanocatalyst. This is a key element of highly efficient, nearly 100 % selective catalyst dedicated to economically justified, sustainable production of hydrogen."
3,Computational design of the LSPR catalysts for hydrogen production,"Constantly growing understanding of the LSPR physics and chemistry combined with simultaneous development of various theoretical models and rapidly increasing computational power provide a plethora of opportunities in numerical modelling and design of LSPR nanocatalysts, specifically for thermophotocatalytic production of hydrogen. In reality, the LSPR-assisted thermophotocatalytic production of hydrogen is very complex process; therefore, this is necessary to divide the entire process into components, and each individual component can be subjected to numerical simulations and optimization procedures using specialized numerical tools. In general, the numerical approaches used to simulate the LSPR-assisted photochemistry can be divided into two groups: 1) the electronic structure-based methods; 2) the Maxwell’s equations based methods. Here, we briefly describe the most commonly used approaches, demonstrating their specific applications. Amongst many electronic structure-based methods, the most commonly used is the density functional theory (DFT). The DFT is indeed very powerful tool when it comes to atomic-scale modelling of LSPR nanomaterials (see Fig. 4 ) and their interaction with molecular species. First of all, DFT methods allow one to determine the dielectric functions of nanomaterials, their dependence on chemical composition and morphology. For instance, a library of dielectric functions of several binary alloys calculated with DFT has been recently reported [45]. Furthermore, DFT simulations turned out to be very successful in the computational design of plasmonic metal-semiconductor heterostructures to quantify the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) and charge transfer across the interface [46], Schottky barrier formation [47] and the entire electronic structure of such heterostructures [46,47]. Ab initio DFT is notoriously applied to analyze the adsorption of molecules on the catalyst surface as a function of its chemical composition and the changes in molecular orbital energies upon chemisorptions [48–52]. In principle, the knowledge about the HOMO-LUMO gap of adsorbate-catalyst system and the energy of antibonding orbitals associated with CH, OH or NH bonds can serve as guidance for tuning the hot electron energies via LSPR. Time dependent DFT and the sophisticated quantum electrodynamics can be used to investigate the initial hot-carrier distribution generated by plasmon decay [44] or the photoinduced charge transfer reactions [53]. The Maxwell’s equations based methods used in numerical modelling of LSPR-driven thermophotocatalysis relay mostly on two implementations: finite element (FEM) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) formalisms [54–56]. In general, these methods enable quantitative investigation of nanoscale electromagnetic associated with LSPR [54]. Using input data from the electronic structure based methods or experiments, it is possible to study absorption and scattering spectra of various LSPR nanomaterials, near- and far-field intensity maps, and their dependence on the size, shape, morphology and the surrounding medium (see Fig. 5 ) [54]. These methods can potentially provide huge flexibility in designing LSPR NPs for thermophotocatalytic production of hydrogen from a given hydrogen carrier. In particular, the tunability, i.e. the modulation of the LSPR wavelength as a function of the ambient refractive index is one of the important features that can be harnessed."
4,(Thermo)photocatalyst structure engineering,"Despite the amplification of the electric field intensity near the surface of the nanoparticles caused by LSPR and various interactions between light and matter resulting from it, the plasmonic nanoparticle alone is not an efficient photocatalyst and its use is limited to a small number of reactions. In order to obtain a powerful photocatalytic system utilizing the plasmonic effect, a plasmonic metal or metal-like nanoparticle is usually coupled in various configurations with another metal or/and with a semiconductor exhibiting photocatalytic properties. Only a combination of unique characteristics of the components and the interaction between them leads to a synergy that significantly enhances the catalytic performance of the designed system. The engineering of a plasmonic photocatalyst should begin with the appropriate selection of its chemical composition and structure at the atomic level. Then, the size and shape of individual nanostructure components must be deliberated. The next step is designing an appropriate spatial arrangement of building blocks within the composite particle. Finally, the organization of nanostructures in a mesoscale that enables their effective use in photoreactors should be considered. In the following section, the possibilities and tools for tailoring plasmonic photocatalysts to gain enhanced reactivity in hydrogen production processes are described."
5,Photocatalyst atomic structure,"5.1 Photocatalyst atomic structure The considerations about the atomic structure are important mainly in the context of an application of semiconductor, which plays the role of a catalyst or co-catalyst in the composite structure. The semiconductor materials combined with the plasmonic metals that are used in photocatalytic hydrogen generation are usually metal oxides such as TiO2, Cu2O, SnO2, WO3, α-Fe2O3, BiVO4, or sulfides like CdS. Recently, two-dimensional nanosheets metal dichalcogenides (TMD), particularly MoS2, ReS2, WS2, together with other 2D structures like graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), graphene, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have attracted significant attention in the field of photocatalysis [57]. TiO2 is the most thoroughly studied photocatalytic material of this group but the general conclusions about structure-properties relationships can be extended to the rest of the semiconductor crystals. The crystalline structure of TiO2 affects its properties, which are important from the point of view of engineering a composite for thermophotocatalytic hydrogen production such as surface trapping of electrons, exposed crystal facets, and defects density. Increasing the crystallinity substantially reduces density of the defects and oxygen vacancies which act as the recombination centers [58]. Low crystallinity decreases the carrier diffusion length and most of the photo-generated carriers recombine before reaching the semiconductor-electrolyte interface and, therefore, do not contribute to the photocatalysis. This phenomenon can be mitigated by the presence of local field enhancement of plasmonic metal nanoparticles deposited on the semiconductor surface [59]. Many research works have investigated the effect of the allotropic form of TiO2 and their mutual proportion in a photocatalyst on the efficiency of hydrogen production. They have shown that rutile has a higher recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and decreased number of surface traps in comparison to anatase. However, the separation of electrons and holes due to the different types of exposed crystal facets is stronger in the case of the rutile particles, which can be beneficial in some photocatalytic reactions [60]. Exposed (001) crystal facets in TiO2 mixed phases structures prominently enhance light absorption and facilitate adsorption and diffusion of reactant molecules. Mixed phases of TiO2 were also found to show reduced recombination between photoelectrons and holes [61]. The type and surface energy of exposed crystal facets determines also the TiO2 affinity to the metal nanoparticles, which is an important factor in the formation and stability of composite catalyst structure [60]. Apart from choosing the specific allotrope and controlling its crystallinity by proper selection of the synthesis method, one can also modify the atomic structure of semiconductor by a doping with additional component. Adding different elements to the crystal structure induces higher-lying impurity levels in the semiconductor. It causes the shift of the conduction and valence bands levels, leading to a change in the wavelength of the absorbed light. Also, a change in the charge carriers’ separation at the junction with another material is observed. An extensive overview of the semiconductor, especially TiO2 doping and co-doping possibilities, is presented in the following review articles [58,62]."
6,"Plasmonic particles (material, size, shape and aspect ratio)","5.2 Plasmonic particles (material, size, shape and aspect ratio) Nanoparticles used in plasmonic photocatalysis are most often synthesized from highly conductive noble metals (Au, Ag) [63]. In noble metals, the decrease in size below the electron mean free path (the distance the electron travels between scattering collisions with the lattice centers) gives rising to intense absorption in the visible and near UV region. Most of the other transition metals show only a broad and poorly resolved absorption band in the ultraviolet region. This difference is attributed to the strong coupling between the plasmon transition and the interband excitation. Other materials exhibiting good plasmonic properties are poor metals: Al, Ga, In, Sn, Tl, Pb, and Bi [64], but their LSPR response lies in the UV range. The light absorption properties of nanoparticles strongly depend on the shape, size, interparticle distance as well as on the dielectric constant of the metal itself and the surrounding medium, which directly influence their photocatalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 6 , changing nanoparticle material, morphology and size enable shifting and extending the spectrum of the absorbed light. The size-dependence of LSPR in the small particle limit is poorly understood due to complex physical and chemical effects and significant uncertainties in the experimental samples. In general, the resonant wavelength is red-shifted when the nanoparticle size increases. However, Peng et al. demonstrated that for colloidal Ag NPs with highly uniform morphologies and narrow size distributions, the LSPR absorption band is blue-shifted as size decreases from d ≈ 20 nm, but suddenly turns over near d ≈ 12 nm and becomes strongly red-shifted [65]. The plasmon resonance of silver, which lies in the UV, can be shifted into the visible range by reducing the nanoparticle diameter. Similarly, it is possible to shift the plasmon resonance of gold from the visible range into the infrared wavelength range by minimizing the nanoparticle size [66]. The size of nanoparticles determines also the ratio of scattered to absorbed light. The low scattering generally occurs when nanoparticles are very small (for example for Au NPs < 50 nm). Also, the local field enhancement is much stronger for the smaller particles (as compered for 30 nm vs. 60 nm Ag NPs in [67]). Spherical nanoparticles when irradiated by a light, act as the oscillating dipole. For larger particles, higher modes of plasmon excitation can occur, such as the quadrupole mode where half of the electron cloud moves parallel to the applied field and half moves antiparallel. The non-spherical particles typically exhibit multiple resonance peaks, because plasmon resonance splits into two or more bands. For nanorods, there are resonance frequencies for two plasmon bands: the high energy band which corresponds to the oscillation of the electrons perpendicular to the major axis of the rods, and the other band which is red-shifted to lower energies and is caused by the oscillation of the electrons along the major axis of the nanorods [68]. The absorption spectrum can be tailored by changing the aspect ratio of the non-spherical crystals. The increase of the aspect ratio causes the longitudinal SPR peak shift toward longer wavelength regions with lower photon energy as shown in Fig. 7 . The number of plasmon bands increases further to three or more as the shape of plasmonic NPs changes to disk or irregular form. This phenomenon is observed for example for silver nanodisks [70] and silver nanoprism [71]. Another irregular crystal shapes to be mentioned are triangle-branched gold NPs [72] and pentacle gold-copper alloy NPs [73], whose absorption spectrum is characterized by several peaks corresponding to different resonance modes. The plasmon resonance for the branched nanocrystals has three bands, corresponding to two in-plane or longitudinal surface plasmon absorptions and one in out-of-plane or transverse plasmon absorption (Fig. 8 ). There are other advantages of the irregular shape of plasmonic NPs. The anisotropic nanoparticles with sharp tips can provide significantly larger near-field enhancements at these tips, which are called as “hot spot” regions [74]. As we already mentioned in section 2, the light intensity can be enhanced by up to 105 times in the hot spot regions. The hot spots can also generate a photothermal effect through the relaxation of hot electrons. An example of such morphology is the gold nanostar presented in Fig. 9 . The low efficiency of plasmonic resonance in transition metals like Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir, which are used in traditional catalytic processes, is due to their unfilled d-orbital, which induces interband excitation under visible light. However, through a precise control of the kinetic process of seed formation and oxidative etching, nonplasmonic metal NPs with specific shapes exhibiting high LSPR absorption can be produced (Fig. 10 ) [63]. Although less popular in plasmonic applications, some non-metallic materials, particularly semiconductors, also exhibit LSPR. To qualify as a low-loss plasmonic material, it must have either a metallic band structure or a wide bandgap and a high plasma frequency [75]. The wide bandgap results in almost no interband losses. The high frequency of plasma, in turn, ensures that the real part of the permittivity functions reach negative values, which is a necessary condition for all plasmonic materials. This condition is fulfilled for heavily doped semiconductors under the incident light in IR frequencies. Noble metals show indeed a stronger optical field enhancement, with the narrow resonance peak located in the visible range, but doped semiconductors possess advantages such as higher melting points, affordability, and possibility of tailoring electron density and reducing rate of momentum relaxation with composition tuning [76]. Also, they have broad plasmonic resonance ranging from visible to NIR. The problem, however, is that very high, difficult to achieve, levels of doping are needed to ensure semiconductor crossover frequencies in the optical range. The non-metallic plasmonic materials are transition metal nitrides, e.g. TiN, TiOxNy, ZrN, HfN [76]; transition metal carbides, e.g. TaC; and transition metal oxides, e.g. WO3−x, heavely doped MoO3−x, SrRuO3 [77,78]. All three of this groups can possess metallic band structure. Highly doped semiconductors like transparent conductive oxides (TCOs, i.e. In-doped tin oxide (ITO), Al-doped ZnO (AZO), or Ga-doped ZnO (GZO), silicides, and germanides can be plasmonic despite they have bandgaps [76,77]. Other group of doped semiconductors is copper-deficient copper chalcogenide nanocrystals (Cu2-xS, Cu2-xSe, Cu2-xTe) [78]. Group-16 chalogen elements (S, Se, Te) also create plasmonic materials in combination with Sb, Ge, and Ga (e.g. Ge2Sb2Te5) [76]. Furthermore, semiconductors of groups 13–15, e.g. GaAs, GaN, GaP, InGaAs, InP, and InSb are potential candidates for plasmonics in the NIR and optical spectral ranges as well as the SiC [78]. Materials that can also be used include transition metal sulfides (such as MoS2), and borides [77]. Transition metal nitrides such as VN and NbN are considered as plasmonics when the blue and near-UV light is used; MoNx has been proposed for far-UV plasmonics [76]. Another non-metallic material that supports plasmon resonance is graphene. The electronic band structure of graphene is similar to the structure of a semiconductor with a vanishing band gap or to a structure of a metal with a vanishing Fermi surface. This characteristics leads to the high electron density and the mobility in graphene. Graphene was shown to exhibits plasmon resonance in mid- and far-infrared frequencies [79]."
7,Hybrid structures,"5.3 Hybrid structures As mentioned earlier, in the contemporary search of an efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen production, an attention is focused on systems combining several components, which through mutual interactions give a synergistic enhancement of the catalytic effect. Thus, nanoparticles of plasmonic metals that absorb light from the visible spectrum are combined into hybrid structures with other metals or semiconductors. That results, among others, in new electronic structure, charge transfer, or optical coupling (plasmon hybridization). Regardless of the nature of the component bonded with the plasmon metal, several characteristic morphologies of catalyst particles can be distinguished. The two main examples are core-shell systems, where a nanoparticle of one material is surrounded by a continuous shell of the other, and decorated systems, where smaller nanoparticles satellites are immobilized on the surface of the core nanoparticle, forming a kind of discrete shell. In the case of bimetallic particles, alloys should also be distinguished. Most of the produced hybrid systems are based on the combination of these morphologies. 5.3.1 Bimetallic catalyst nanoparticles consisting of plasmonic and nonplasmonic metals Plasmonic metals have a d-band far from the Fermi level, so electrons resonate when excited with light instead of passing between bands. The situation is different in the case of metals with good catalytic properties, such as Pt, Rh, and Ti. They have a d-band close to the Fermi level, so when excited with light, interband transitions of electrons dominate. These transitions usually need high energy what makes these metals non-photoactive under solar irradiation. However, their electronic structure is often required to catalyze the reaction as it promotes chemisorption, which is one of the critical steps affecting reaction efficiency [80–82]. Regular catalytic particles usually operate at high temperatures resulting in high-energy consumption and by-product formation. The idea behind combining plasmon and catalytic metals is to use local field enhancement and plasmon's decay products: photons, hot electrons and heat to enhance the catalytic properties of the latter. The combination of plasmon and catalytic particles improves overall reaction efficiency. Bimetallic catalysts demonstrate also increased reaction rate, optical sensitivity, and product selectivity [66,83,84]. The simplest system in which the effect of plasmon resonance can be utilized is a pair of nanoparticles that are in close proximity, but not in contact with each other (there is no transfer of charge carriers between them) [85–87]. One of the nanoparticles acts as an antenna (plasmonic metal) and the other as a reactor (catalytic metal). A schematic of such an arrangement is presented in the Fig. 11 a). The plasmonic antenna induces a resonant response in the nearby catalytic reactor [88,89]. Optical coupling is greater when both particles show SPR in a similar range of the spectrum, when antenna symmetry is broken by the reactor, or when the gap between particles is very small. Strongly localized amplification of the electromagnetic field occurs in the gap between the reactor and the antenna, or on the surface of the reactor, creating the hot spot. Such systems can be produced on a flat substrate by lithography, but particulate catalysts utilizing this mechanism are synthesized using colloidal chemistry methods. Hybrid particles based on antenna – reactor effect often have morphology of the core-shell with additional surface decoration with smaller particles. The internal metallic particle, which plays the role of the antenna, is covered with a semiconductor spacer shell, which gives a tunable distance between the core and the reactor nanoparticles deposited on the surface [88–90]. An example of a particle morphology utilizing the antenna-reactor effect is demonstrated in Fig. 11 b) and c). The second type of bimetallic hybrid structure is a plasmonic core – catalytic shell morphology. In the case of plasmon photocatalysis, bimetallic particles with various types of shells, ranging from monocrystalline or dendritic, continuous or sporadic, with a conformal or differently shaped coating, have been studied [91–94]. The direct contact between metals, besides optical coupling, leads to a new electronic structure and charge transfer across the interface. Adding the core material enables shifting the distance of the d-band from the Fermi level of the shell material, affecting molecules adsorption on the catalyst surface, and thus its catalytic activity [95]. Micrographs of bimetallic core-shell nanostructures examples are shown in Fig. 12 . The plasmonic core acts as the antenna, but its response is damped, spectrally shifted, broadened, and lower in the intensity compared to the original plasmonic response of the uncoated nanoparticle. That is why further development of bimetallic photocatalyst comprises selective deposition of catalytic material only at the hot spots of the plasmonic antenna [96–99] (Fig. 13 ). The partial shelling of the antenna maintains its strong plasmonic response and leads to the enhancement of the activity in comparison to fully shelled particles [93]. The antenna itself may also have the core-shell or core-satellite structure coupling two plasmonic metals (Fig. 14 ). LSPRs of such particles can be finely tuned by varying the size/shape of the core and the thickness of the shell to modify the length of the absorbed light [100–103]. Mixing two metals at the atomic level creates an alloy – the third possible bimetallic system for photocatalysis [66,73,104]. In this case, metallic nanoparticles serve as both, the light absorber and host to the catalytic sites. The electronic structure of the catalytic metal and the resulting charge transfer is an outcome of an atom electronegativity, different atomic bond lengths, the strain and ligand effect, and the atomic distributions [105]. Any modification to the composition changes both, the plasmonic and the catalytic properties of the particles. Due to alloying, the isolated catalytic sites are created in the form of highly active islands or single atomic sites. Their presence can prevent side reaction and catalyst poisoning, because it binds reactants and products more weakly [106]. The number, position, and profile of the LSPR peak are also highly sensitive to the spatial arrangement and atomic ordering of the two different types of metal atoms. For instance, fully alloyed Ag-Au nanoparticles exhibited different LSPR peak position from the Au@Ag core-shell nanoparticles, although the molar ratio of the components was the same [107]. 5.3.2 Plasmonic nanoparticle-semiconductor composites The enhancement of the photocatalysts activity can be achieved through the formation of heterojunctions by coupling plasmonic nanostructures with semiconductors. It results in plasmonic energy transfer from metal nanostructure to the semiconductor. Metallic nanoparticle acts as tunable light antennas across a wide spectrum of the irradiation source with the extension of the light absorption range of the coupled semiconductor. The detailed concepts and principles of plasmonics with an explanation of the mechanisms of the basic enhancement process are discussed in the following papers [108–111]. Generally, plasmonic energy in a metal can be transferred to a semiconductor through three major mechanisms (as illustrated in Fig. 15 ): • light scattering/trapping • plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) • hot electron injection. Understanding of the above mechanism directs us for rational designing of the effective heterojunctions of plasmonic metal with a semiconductor. The theoretical maximum efficiency of light energy conversion indicates the possibility of improvement of the performance of plasmonic metal-semiconductor heterojunctions. The optimal solution, depending on the specific application, requires a rational design of the final structure of the metallic NP-semiconductor composite including its chemical composition. As shown in reference [113] simply mixing plasmonic metal nanoparticle and semiconductor particles leads to a weak interaction between both components. The “device-by-design” strategy requires exploiting one or more of the above-mentioned major plasmonic energy transfer mechanisms. The band gap of the semiconductor used in the composite is, for example, one of the key factors when designing plasmonic metal-semiconductor heterojunctions, because of its role in the plasmonic coupling between both components of the composite. The band gap modulates the PIRET efficiency or light trapping effectiveness. Its value directly determines which mechanism of the plasmonic energy transfer is dominant in the particular structural solution for specific photocatalytic process, and the light characteristic used. The photocatalytic structures combining plasmonic metal with a semiconductor correspond morphologically to the geometries described earlier for metallic systems. For instance, decorated particles, in which metallic [114–117] or bimetallic nanoparticles having the core-shell structure themselves [118,119], were deposited on the semiconductor core, and used for the hydrogen production. The inverse morphology of this system, where the plasmonic nanoparticle is shelled by semiconductor, was also studied, [120,121]. The surface of such particle can be further decorated with catalytic metal nanoparticles to obtain a ternary hybrid with enhanced catalytic performance [121]. The strong near-field coupling is observed in the structures with multilayered [122] or multiparticle [123] plasmonic cores surrounded by the semiconductor. Another variation of this geometry in the plasmonics is when metallic nanoparticles are embedded between a core and a shell made of semiconductors, which behave as a convex nanolens enhancing the absorption energy [124]. For some architectures comprising a plasmonic core, the electrons transferred from the conduction band of the semiconductor may accumulate and retain in it, and not participate in the photocatalytic reaction. That is why much attention in hydrogen evolution processes have been given to partially shelled particles, such as nanodumbbells [126,127] or nanomushrooms [128,129]. The anisotropy and/or asymmetry of these geometries result in better energy transfer, carrier separation and light utilization, and thus a higher reaction efficiency. Similar effects were found for non-centrosymmetric Janus metal–semiconductor photocatalysts [129], and more complex three- [130–132] or four-component heterostructures [132]. Another trend in the engineering of hybrid photocatalysts for hydrogen production is the deposition of plasmonic nanoparticles on two-dimensional structures [133–137]. The methods of producing hybrid 2D materials and their unusual properties are extensively discussed in reference [138]. 2D materials do not always occur as the composite in the form of a flake substrate. In the case of some catalysts, nanosheets coat the particle metallic core [123], or they constitute a spherical structure with a highly developed surface on which metallic nanoparticles are deposited [139]. An overview of the nanostructures described in this section is presented in Fig. 16 . Systems with non-metallic material exhibiting plasmon resonance, have been successfully used for hydrogen production. Large area laminated MoS2 in conjunction with TiO2 nanocavity arrays gives MoS2@TiO2 heterostructure, which shows the broad spectral response ranging from UV–vis to NIR wavelengths [140]. Finite element frequency-domain simulations suggest that MoS2@TiO2 heterostructure enhances photocatalytic activity for H+ reduction. Nanocomposite Co@TaC photocatalyst were utilized for a conversion of greenhouse gases including CO2 and CH4 into CO and H2 under visible light [141]. Co@TaC absorbed light in the wavelength range from 300 to 1000 nm through LSPR."
8,Photocatalyst meso-scale structure engineering,"5.4 Photocatalyst meso-scale structure engineering The use of nanometer-sized materials poses some serious problems such as the expensive separation processes that the post-reaction mixture has to undergo. The difficulties and costs of separation are not present when using larger particles. Hence, the next step of photocatalyst engineering should be creating an appropriate hierarchical structure consisting of plasmonic nano building blocks and facilitating their industrial use. Photocatalytic reactions differ from conventional thermal-base ones by the requirements of a radiation field to activate the catalyst. Efficiency of such reactions is measured by the ratio between the rates of photoreaction and the rate of photon absorption of the catalyst. The fraction of light transmitted, reflected and adsorbed at each point of catalyst influences the reaction rate [143,144]. The internal and external mass transfer also ought to be considered in any real photocatalytic processes with immobilized catalyst in the reactor. The limiting effect of the entire process could be distinguished through quantitative evaluation of the reaction and mass transfer rate. The concept of the Weisz-Prater modules φ, which is derived from Thiele module, can be used for that [145,146]. The module φ is based on observable parameters and is expressed as: ϕ = r ∙ d 2 / D e ∙ c where r is experimental rate of reaction per unit of catalyst, d – the characteristic dimension of deposits, c – surface gas – phase concentration, and De – the effective diffusivity. Any evaluation results for particular reactor construction goes to the architecture and chemical composition of the catalyst pellet. Construction of the photocatalytic pellet dedicated to the large-scale application should take into account different scales of transport phenomena of reaction components in the reaction environment. Reactants are transported to the catalyst surface by convective diffusion and/or Knudsen diffusion and then, adsorbed on the solid surface. In addition, they can move to the active sites of the catalyst through surface diffusion. Light becomes an additional reaction component in photocatalysis. Effective harvesting of the irradiation waves is also an important factor, which defines the catalyst structure. Taking into account severe hydrodynamical conditions usually present in the photocatalytic continuous-flow reactor, the mechanical resistance of the pellet structure should be an additional important factor for the catalyst design. In addition, the design of the catalyst should consider an effective access of the entire surface to reactants. The controlled porosity of the catalyst fulfills this requirement. All those above-mentioned constraints direct us to effective construction of mesoporous spherical structures as a candidate for photocatalysts pellet. Nanotechnologies allow the construction of an effective catalyst. One of the effective routes for the production of structures complying with above-mentioned features is aerosol technique, in particulate spray-drying and flame synthesis. The principle of the spray-drying of colloidal suspensions is presented in Fig. 17 and described in more detail in the references [147–150]. The water suspension of colloidal particles, which is considered as a precursor, is atomized in a nozzle or ultrasonic nebulizer. Generated droplets include the assumed number of the selected particles. Droplets suspended in a carrier gas are dried in the reactor. Water gradually evaporates and particles included in it organize in an appropriate structure. The flow rate of aerosol and reactor temperature defines the conditions of drying and final organization of colloids in solid composite particles. In the case, when the precursor suspension contains host and template particles the composite is introduced into the zone of the reactor with higher temperature for removal of the template material. Depending on the zeta potential of both, the host and templating particles, the porous and hollow particles are formed (Fig. 17b, c, d), [150–152]. The host particles, which form the final structure of the product, could be a support surface for its further decoration with an active photocatalyst, or it could be directly one of the components of the photocatalytic pellet. The porosity of nanostructured particles is controlled by size and concentration of both components of the precursor. As an example, the silica porous particles produced with precursor consisting of silica (host) and PSL (template) is shown in Fig. 18 . The number n in the figure denotes the number of PSL template particles in the atomized droplet. The composite of metal oxide and metal particle as a final product could be also produced in one step using the spray-drying process. In this case, the precursor consists of PSL as template material and tungsten oxide (WO3) particles with platinum Pt particles as a host material [153]. The principle behind the formation of porous WO3/Pt structures is demonstrated in Fig. 19 [149]. The second group of aerosol methods, which are powerful for engineering catalyst structures at the atomic, nano- and mesoscale in one-step process, are flame synthesis processes. In these processes, the gaseous or atomized liquid precursor is burned in the reactor flame. The metallic precursor is oxidized, and the oxide form solid particles through gas phase nucleation. The process can be classified depending on the precursor state fed to the flame in the vapor-fed aerosol flame synthesis (VAFS) and liquid-fed aerosol flame synthesis (LAFS). The latter can be further distinguished between the flame-assisted spray pyrolysis (FASP), when the precursor is non-flammable and the flame is created as a result of combustion of gas fed in the spray nozzle, and the flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) process, if the precursor is dissolved in a flammable solvent whose combustion provides the energy needed in the process [154]. The physical and chemical properties of as-synthesized solid photocatalytic materials can be controlled by proper choice of the process parameters [155]. The characteristics and performance of particles synthesized in the flame process are affected by their synthesis temperature history and concentration, which are controlled by burner configuration, precursor composition and fuel flow rates. Flame made nanoparticles went through high temperatures and cooling rates which results in some unique phases and good thermal stability and mass transfer during catalysis [156]. Flame methods enable the synthesis of nanoparticles with diverse morphology (Fig. 20 ). Depending on the temperature of the flame, the synthetized nanoparticles may undergo either full coalescence leading to the spherical shape, or agglomeration and permanent sintering, forming bigger, porous, fractal-like aggregates (Fig. 21 ). As opposed to wet-chemical routes with many post-treatment steps, such as filtration, washing, drying and calcination, aerosol flame processes allow the preparation of the desired material without any further post-processing. Flame processes for the photocatalyst preparation also have the advantage that multicomponent forms of catalysts can be readily prepared and their mixing can be controlled to obtain different distributions of components inside the particle. The use of flame synthesis includes production of mixed oxides photocatalysts (e.g. V2O5/TiO2, TiO2/SiO2, etc.) [154]. Flame methods, and in particular FSP, are also used to obtain metal particles deposited on substrates (supports) in the form of oxides (e.g. Pt/TiO2, Pd/Al2O3, Pt/CeO2/ZrO2, Pt/Ba/Al2O3, Ag/ZnO, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, bimetallic Pd/Pt/Al2O3 and Au/TiO2) [154]. The vapor pressure of metals is relatively high compared to the vapor pressure of supporting oxides, which makes it possible to produce oxide particles coated with metal particles in one process. After evaporation and combustion of the precursor, an oxide particle is firstly formed, and then in the region of the flame with a lower temperature, the nucleation of metal particles occurs: heterogeneous, if the particles nucleate on the surface of the oxide particles, or homogeneous in the gas phase with subsequent deposition of metal particles on the surface of the oxide particles [158]. Flame processes can serve as the method for the production of TiO2 based photocatalysts. As stated earlier in this article, TiO2 is one of the most important materials for photocatalysis, hence more attention has been paid to it, but similar procedures also apply to other semiconducting materials. The flame-made TiO2 is much more active than titania aero- or xerogels [154]. AFS allows precise control of TiO2 particle size and crystallinity through varying the residence time of the particles in the hot flame zone during preparation. Compared to pure anatase powders, the presence of small amounts of rutile results in more active catalysts [154]. For very small particles (smaller than 14 nm), the quantum size effects increase the band-gap energy and make them more active. Charge transfer efficiency, OH− generation and Ti3+ defect sites are other factors that strongly affect the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 particles and can be controlled in the flame synthesis process. Flame technology allows also the incorporation of titania suboxides on the particle surface and therefore, the precise tailoring of the visible light absorption intensity and photocatalyst activity [159]. Similarly to the spray-drying, the spray-pyrolysis process can be combined with colloidal templating, in order to produce catalyst particles with controlled porosity. The process includes the evaporation of solvent, followed by the pyrolysis reaction and decomposition of the PSL beads serving as template. The pyrolysis may take place either in the reactor flame [160], or in the high temperature furnace [161]. This method can be used to produce various types of porous oxide particles (e.g. SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2. Y2O3 [161], WO3 [162] with morphology as shown in (Fig. 22 a, b) [160,161]. The metal nano-clusters can be incorporated into the structure in the same flame process (Fig. 22c, d) [160]."
9,Efficient hydrogen generation,"Presently, hydrogen production (generation) reached a status of reliable and mature technology asserting itself as an important for industrial practice, since hydrogen is not only a basic chemical feedstock but also the key compound for the energy cycles. Due to the fact that it holds tremendous promise as future energy carrier it is also called the ‘energy vector’ [163]. Annual worldwide production of hydrogen in 2019 reached 70 million tons, mainly for the use in oil refineries (23 %), ammonia and methanol production processes (61 % and 9% respectively), by merchant users (4%) or other purposes (3%) [164]. There are several main sources (feedstocks) for the world's commercial production of hydrogen, including water, biomass, or fossil fuels [165–167]. Seven key production technologies falling into three broad categories: • thermal: Natural Gas/Methane Reforming, Bio-Derived Liquids Reforming, Coal and Biomass Gasification, Thermochemical Water Splitting; • electrolytic: Water Electrolysis; • photolytic: Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting, Photobiological Water Splitting, are presently utilized to generate hydrogen for various purposes and with different efficiencies. Details concerning feedstocks, efficiencies and maturity status of the most common technologies used for hydrogen production are summarized in Table 1 . Massproduction of hydrogen relies particularly on steam reforming of natural gas or methane [169,170], thermal decomposition/gasification (e.g ammonia decomposition [171]) and water electrolysis processes. Thus, in the vast majority of technologies, predominant sources of hydrogen are fossil fuels, biomass or water/aqueous solutions. Most of technologies used for hydrogen production from various feedstocks require additional energy, i.e. heat or electricity, to run and maintain the production process. At the present level of advancement, technologies based on water as a raw material are characterized by the highest energy consumption, so thus they provide small fraction amongst world hydrogen production. Photoconversion processes (Fig. 23 ), in turn, are driven by solar irradiation which is considered as an ultimate solution to energy and environmental problems, attracting many research groups in their scientific explorations [172,173]. Direct solar-to-hydrogen photoconversion processes (photocatalytic, photoelectrochemical, photobiological, photovoltaic; see in [164] offer key benefits as they may occur at near-ambient conditions, are clean and sustainable, and less complex than solar thermal systems. Moreover, as mentioned in section 5, proper design of (nano-)photocatalyst – particularly its metal/semiconductor heterojunction – is a major challenge because it can provide substantial boost of reaction rate and enhancement of quantum yield by plasmon resonance induced [174]. The local thermal effect can be also induced, which result in thermophotocatalytic system in nanoscale regions (see section 2) without heating up the whole system (avoiding application of ‘thermo cycle’ route). Photocatalytic overall water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is thermodynamically demanding reaction [175,176]. Usually, the photocatalytic reactions are carried out in an aqueous solution of organic compound(s) such as alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol) or organic acids (formic acid, acetic acid). These compounds are used as sacrificial agents for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. The literature survey indicates that methanol is mostly used for evaluation of the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, regarding the improved reaction rates obtained for plasmon-photocatalysts in water splitting (see Table 2 ), one may notice that the process has a potential in efficient hydrogen generation [177]. Based on the literature survey and the data listed in Table 2, it may be inferred that the mostly reported plasmonic-photocatalysts for hydrogen generation consist of the heterojunctions of Au, Ag, Cu and Pt (with various morphologies) as plasmon nanoparticles with sulfides (Zn0.67Cd0.33S, ReS2, MoS2) or TiO2 semiconductors as the support. That specific design enables nanocatalysts to possess enhanced photocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution, contrary to their separate counterparts which usually are almost inactive. The measured hydrogen generation rates are strongly dependent on rational, “function-oriented” design of photocatalyst morphology (e.g. size, shape), content, manufacturing quality, and measurement conditions (irradiation, solution concentration etc.). Beside the H2 generation rate, these factors also strongly determine primary mechanisms for metal SPR-enhanced activity for a certain photocatalyst system [186,187]. One of the most attractive results obtained within reported plasmonic-photocatalysts for hydrogen production has been presented in [178]. Photocatalysts with nano-sized Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction catalysts, having octahedral morphology, reached outstanding photocatalytic hydrogen generation performance - 24.83 mmol g–1 h–1, from water splitting (aqueous methanol solution). The best catalyst, containing 1.9 % of copper, gave the highest hydrogen yield which was approx. 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the pristine TiO2 (0.03 mmol g–1 h–1). The Authors stated that the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 catalyst has been achieved due to the presence of Cu2O by broadening the light absorption from the ultraviolet region to about 515 nm. Authors evaluated high photocatalytic stability of the best used catalyst by performing ten cycles of reuse and proved it by reporting repeatable result. Also, high chemical stability of the used catalysts was investigated by detecting no observable changes in the structure via XRD analysis after 10 h of operation. Another spectacular experimental contribution is reported in [179], where plasmonic-Au@Zn x Cd1− x S photocatalyst was prepared by a hydrothermal method. Four variants of photocatalyst were subjected to testing: pure Zn0.67Cd0.33S, and Zn0.67Cd0.33S with Au nanoparticles loaded on the surface (Au-surf@Zn0.67Cd0.33S), embedded in the body (Au-iso@Zn0.67Cd0.33S), Au-nanochains on the surface (Au-chain@Zn0.67Cd0.33S). Hydrogen evolution activities reached 5020, and 8290, 11 560, 16420 μmol h−1 g−1 respectively, and the apparent quantum yield: 14.2 %, and 19.3 %, 28.7 %, and 43.5 % respectively. It can be concluded that the average distance and the spatial arrangement of plasmonic Au affected the photocatalytic performance performance as shown in Fig. 24 Thus, as the Authors inferred, the photocatalytic activity of Au-chain@Zn0.67Cd0.33S is about 20 times of commercial CdS (830 μmol h−1 g−1), and 3.3 times of pure Zn0.67Cd0.33S prepared with the same method as Au-chain@Zn0.67Cd0.33S. In addition, stable photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate was reported for the Au-chain@Zn0.67Cd0.33S catalyst in more than 40 h reaction process. Both, catalyst crystal structure and surface properties remained unchanged as the analysis of XRD patterns and XPS spectra showed. In comparison, Au-miltimer@MoS2 photocatalyst has been proven to reach the hydrogen gas production yield of 2997.2 μmol g−1 in the water splitting reaction, what is approx. 3.4 times and 1.4 times increment as compared to that of the pure MoS2 (881.6 μmol g−1) and Au-monomer@MoS2, respectively [123]. The MoS2 support was pre-decorated and integrated with Aumultimers composed of 3–6 NPs with 5–10 nm inter-particle distance. As the result, strong near-field enhancement was achieved what significantly promoted the light absorption, exciton generation of the MoS2, and the plasmon-exciton coupling between the Au and MoS2 (Fig. 25 ). The photocatalytic stability has been evaluated via carrying out 4 cycles of photocatalytic reaction lasting for 4 h per each cycle. As the evaluation showed about 87.6 %, 86.4 %, 80.2 %, and 79.3 % photocatalytic activity retains for the Au-monomer@MoS2, the Au-multimer@MoS2 core-shell structures, the pure MoS2 spheres and the Au multimer@MoS2 spheres, respectively. In the case of CdS/(Au-ReS2) nanocatalyst (with the diameter approx. 220 nm and 9% weight percentage of Au), high efficiency and photocatalytic performance for hydrogen generation has been observed [57] and measured at the rate of 3060 μmol g−1 h−1. Thus, the measured H2 production rate is 797, 319, 105 and 12 times larger than this of pure ReS2, Au-ReS2, CdS, and CdS-ReS2, respectively. Moreover, the Authors found that if the diameter of ReS2 dielectric antenna is increased nearly twice (from 114 to 218 nm), the hydrogen production rate for CdS/(Au–ReS2) nanocatalyst is increased by more than 1.85 times, and the resonance wavelength for the ReS2 dielectric antenna shifts from 380 to 620 nm. The enhanced photocatalytic activity for CdS/(Au–ReS2) is patricularly attributed to the strong local field enhancement generated by the Au–ReS2 dielectric–plasmon hybrid antenna (Fig. 26 a). In the Fig. 26b, the possible mechanism of the visible light induced photocatalytic H2 evolution for CdS/(Au–ReS2) heterostructures is depicted. The mechanism includes four pathways: i) trapping the electrons by the ReS2 nanospheres; ii) suppression the recombination of electron–hole pairs between CdS and ReS2; iii) injection of hot electrons and the plasmon resonant energy transfer from Au into CdS; iv) transfer of plasmon-induced hot electrons on Au into ReS2. The most important role in the high H2 evolution rate in CdS/(Au–ReS2) heterostructures plays the interaction between the plasmon and the exciton. First step is the decay of plasmon excited in Au into hot electrons and their further injection into CdS according to pathway iii (Fig. 26b). Then the light-harvesting ability of CdS could be enhanced both by the large local field of Au and the intense scattering of the ReS2 dielectric antenna. Furthermore, the hot electron injection and the plasmon resonant energy transfer from Au to CdS benefit from the plasmon resonance absorption of Au NPs in the visible region. More details of the presented mechanism are described in [57]. Beside the high photocatalytic activity, CdS/(Au-ReS2) catalysts demonstrates excellent photocatalytic stability and reusability. To evaluate the photostability of the CdS/(Au–ReS2) composites, five consecutive photocatalytic reactions were carried out (4 h each). Measurements of the H2 evolution vs time showed that H2 production rate increased from the first to the third round and became stable in the two last rounds. Therefore, it was demonstrated that CdS/(Au–ReS2) can retain 133 % of its initial efficiency for hydrogen evolution in the fifth reaction cycle, even without the addition of new sacrificial agents. For the photocatalysts containing Cu and Au (and mixed) plasmon nanoparticles, enhanced hydrogen photogeneration has been reported. Under UV/Vis irradiation, Au/TiO2 photocatalyst with approx. 1% Au content reached even 33 mmol g−1 h-1 [180]. Schematic illustration of the different electron transfer mechanisms in Au–TiO2 photocatalyst is demonstrated in Fig. 27 and described in detail in [183,188]. Analogically, the best mixed system Cu/Au/TiO2, fabricated by stepwise precipitation, was able to generate hydrogen from aqueous MeOH solution at the rate of 11 mmol g−1 h−1 [183]. The photocatalytic experiments have been repeated with freshly prepared catalysts and gas samples were taken for GC analysis. However, the variations of the generated hydrogen volumes between 5–25 % were measured (including the error of the measurement set‐up and reproducibility of the catalyst preparation method). In the papers [181,182] Authors presented an efficient strategy to accumulate multiple photogenerated electrons on catalytic Pt active sites for enhanced hydrogen evolution through rational catalyst design toward broadband light harvesting and unidirectional electron flow realized by tuning the dielectric environment and spatial distribution of Pt nanoparticles. Three interesting photocatalytic heterostructure architectures, denoted as SiO2/Pt/TiO2, SiO2/TiO2/i-Pt, SiO2/TiO2/Pt, have been designed, simulated, fabricated and investigated. For all nanocomposite structures almost optically transparent SiO2 spheres with average diameter of 300 nm were employed as support and Schottky junction and different spatial distribution between Pt and TiO2 were constructed. In the SiO2/Pt/TiO2, Pt NPs were assembled onto SiO2 core and then a thin TiO2 shell was introduced. The other two were fabricated by initial coating of SiO2 with TiO2 thin shell but varied in spatial distribution of Pt NPs loaded onto TiO2 shell realized by impregnation method (random; SiO2/TiO2/i-Pt) or self-assembling (equidistant; SiO2/TiO2/Pt). Photoactivity of the nanocatalysts for hydrogen production was measured under simulated sunlight with the intensity of 300 mW cm−2 for 2 h. Under identical reaction conditions, SiO2/Pt/TiO2, SiO2/TiO2/i-Pt, and SiO2/TiO2/Pt produce the hydrogen of 833, 1289, and 2465 μmol g−1, respectively (see Fig. 28 a, b). The SiO2/TiO2/Pt composites containing 2 wt. % Pt show the highest activity for hydrogen evolution. This could result from the microstructure because the Pt NPs located at the outermost layer are directly exposed to the reactants, the photogenerated electrons transferred from TiO2 to Pt NPs can efficiently reduce the protons to hydrogen over the active sites of Pt surface. Additionally, the Pt NPs distributed onto TiO2 shell harvest the near‐field scattered vis‐NIR light of the support to produce hot electrons. Proposed reaction mechanism for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution over SiO2/TiO2/Pt is illustrated in Fig. 28c. When TiO2 shell absorbs UV light, electrons are excited from its valence band (VB) to conduction band (CB). The Schottky junction formed between TiO2 and Pt promotes the vectorial electron migration from TiO2 to Pt NPs, which, additionally, are able to recycle scattered vis-NIR photons in the near field of the support to produce hot electrons. Directly exposed Pt NPs surface with increased electron density act as sufficient active sites for hydrogen production with low overpotential and charge may be transferred to adsorbed protons to produce atomic hydrogen. The SiO2/TiO2/Pt and SiO2/Pt/TiO2 composites both exhibit high photoactivity and photostability in hydrogen production for 50 h of simulated sunlight irradiation. In comparison. a gradual decrease of hydrogen production has been observed for SiO2/TiO2/i‐Pt, which results from the leaching of Pt NPs into the solution. As can be noted, the demonstrated examples clearly indicate the superiority of plasmonic thermophotocatalysts over conventional photocatalysts, when it comes to a sustainable and efficient hydrogen generation. Typical hydrogen production rates for nonplasmonic systems are ∼5–20 μmol g−1 h−1 in case of water splitting reaction [189], and can reach up to ∼2700 μmol g−1 h−1 in case of methanol photoreforming [190]. These values are approximately from one to even six orders of magnitude smaller in comparison to the plasmonic thermophotocatalysts. Such a huge difference between plasmonic and nonplasmonic photocatalysts originates primarily from significantly higher quantum efficiency of plasmonic systems in converting photons into hydrogen. High quantum efficiency, in turn, can be achieved by LSPR and large electric field enhancement, leading to significant increase in photon absorption in near field that can reach even 105 for some antenna-reactor type systems. Another important factor of plasmonic photocatalysts, which is missing in regular photocatalytic systems, is the local heating generated by LSPR decay that may vibronicaly excite the molecules and lower the activation barrier of the photocatalytic reaction. Efficient production and supplying hydrogen constitute great interest of the world hydrogen industry. Continuous growth of demand for hydrogen (more than threefold since late ‘70 s) implies more and more utilization of fossil fuels as feedstocks. Strong demand toward process development for hydrogen production engaging renewable resources is directly derived from the need of reducing negative environmental impact of existing technologies and progressive release of greenhouse gases, and introducing carbon-free renewable energy sources [164,191]. Therefore, using fossil fuels entails emission as much as 2.5–5.0 tons of carbon (released as CO2) per ton of hydrogen produced, which may give approx. 830 million tons of carbon dioxide per year. Despite of being low- or near zero emission, sunlight-driven processes can bring additional benefits. Photocatalytic generation of hydrogen from aqueous organic solutions, for instance, allows simultaneous wastewater cultivation what is an unquestionable advantage [192]. Despite that several highly efficient photocatalysts have been reported to date and highly positive environmental impact is expected, still there are many challenges and R&D needs ahead the plasmonic-thermophotocatalytic generation of hydrogen on a large scale. Stable and durable material solutions should be designed maintaining the high activity and efficiency, as well as high-volume production should be optimized to lower the operational costs. Obviously, proper design of photoreactors in terms of geometry and operation characteristics are of great importance for achieving highly efficient hydrogen production systems (see section 7)."
10,Continuous-flow reactors for hydrogen production through plasmonic thermophotocatalysis,"There is a limited number of studies on photocatalytic H2 production at pilot plant-scale that have been reported [5,193–196]. Some research groups have produced H2 under solar light applying Compound Parabolic Concentrator reactors (CPC), because they are considered as the best option to collect both direct and diffuse irradiation. The effective absorption of photons by the photocatalyst in the reactor is a challenge for scaled-up application of a hydrogen production system based on heterogeneous photocatalysis. The spatial distribution of light and photon absorption are suggested to be strongly dependent on the photocatalyst concentration and the geometry of the photoreactor [197,198]. Photo-thermo conversion is an important route to harvest solar energy and to enable its use in a broad range of applications, including environmental air/water detoxification/disinfection, water distillation/desalination, and the photocatalytic production of fuels and chemicals [199,200]. This approach fits perfectly within the solar bio-refinery concept, where solar energy is a utility which can be used through various applications, for instance, photons can carry out chemical reactions in photocatalytic, photo-electrochemical and photolysis reactions [201]. A perfect solution to the drawbacks of the two kinds of catalytic systems (Thermo- and photocatalytic ones) is to have an interconnected system based on both photo and thermal catalysis. The development of such a system will revolutionize substantially the usage of solar energy [200]. The existing investigations directly connected with reactor engineering for thermophotocatalysis, especially for plasmonic thermophotocatalysis, are scarce (if not null) based on our best knowledge. In this section, we will focus the readers' attention on continuous-flow reactors. One important reason for that is that the scalability in batch processes is problematic due to the attenuation effect of photon transport within a given medium/reactor. This principle refers to the Bouguer − Lambert − Beer law, which prevents the use of a dimension-enlarging strategy for scale-up. If a larger reactor is used, and reaction times increased, then over-irradiation of the reaction mixture can become an important issue. This may result in the photodecomposition of reagents and/or products as well as the formation of by-products, complicating the overall purification/separation process. The use of continuous-flow in photocatalysis, in great part, addresses issues associated with batch photocatalysis [202,203]. A recent and authoritative review highlights the critical reasons why flow technology is considered to be important in photocatalysis: (a) reliable scale-up; (b) improved irradiation of the reaction mixture; (c) improved reaction selectivity and increased reproducibility; (d) chemistry in multiphase systems; (e) rapid heat exchange; (f) fast mixing; (g) supported photocatalysts; (h) multistep reaction sequences; (i) increased safety of operation [204]. Following these lines, one additional important factor is related to the phase of the reaction (i.e., gas phase or liquid phase) for the arrangement of the catalyst in the reactor in the shape of dispersion or supported phase, which is an important parameter to address and extract higher thermo-photocatalytic efficiency. This efficiency also depends on the reactor design, which determines (1) better absorption of light and heat by the catalyst, and (2) better interaction of the catalyst with the reactant. The energy source also plays a vital role in selecting the reactor type, such as a quartz/glass reactor with a high-energy lamp (with the respective cooling system) or a higher capacity reactor using concentric mirrors to focus the solar irradiation. The type of materials for the reactor is also a key parameter which should have high light transmittance and high thermal stability. The use of thermophotocatalysis may help decrease the temperature of operation (cheaper materials for reactors construction) concerning thermal processes and speed up kinetics with respect to photo-assisted processes. Such temperature reduction could also contribute to improving stability, which is a mandatory property of plasmonic themophotocatalysis. The use of specially designed reactors that can equally allow the exposure of the catalyst to light and heat is a very important aspect of developing a thermo-photocatalytic system [205]. Commercial Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC)-based reactors have been operated under the Sun for enhanced hydrogen production [206–208]. The use of the catalyst in the reactor, especially at elevated temperatures or for gas-phase reactions, can cause agglomeration of catalysts and reduce reaction activity and light selectivity. To ensure stability, catalysts are deposited upon substrates like films or nanowires [209]. The substrates are required to have high light absorption, specific surface area, and thermal endurance. However, light absorption is mostly on the surface of deposited catalysts rather than volumetric (as in liquids), and thus a rational design of the reaction bed and reactor is still required [6]. The morphologies of supported catalysts, such arrays of nanosheets, nanotubes, and nanorods, are also important parameters for efficient light trapping, and of course to eliminate the problems related to mass transport limitations, which is the Achilles’ heel of any heterogeneous catalyst, the circumstance in which reactions become diffusion-limited and independent of the catalyst efficiency [210]. This is frequently evaluated as an 'engineering problem' by chemists, which will be solved through reactor design [211], but the smart design of heterogeneous catalysts' structure and interfaces by the chemist can positively contribute to this research field [212]. As far as rector engineering is concerned, there is no doubt that continuous flow reactors (especially micro-flow-reactors) are much more competitive from each point of view than batch reactors. Flow microreactors have better energy efficiency, reaction rate, safety, a much more adequate degree of process control, better molecular diffusion, and heat-transfer properties compared with the conventional batch reactor. The use of fluidic microreactors (see conventional flow microreactors designs on Fig. 29 ) for photocatalytic reactions is also being considered to be the appropriate reactor configuration because of its improved irradiation profile, better light penetration through the entire reactor depth, and higher spatial illumination homogeneity [204,212–215]. Recently, flow microreactors for hydrogen production through photocatalysis (not thermophotocatalysis), using hydrocarbons as substrate, have been used to give the on-line hydrogen source for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). As a result, flow microreactors have demonstrated a promising future for hydrogen production [217]. In the open literature, some interesting configurations such as the laminated plate structure, which has some benefits over other microreactor configurations in terms of scaling up plate numbers according to the reaction demand and having the ability to integrate with complicated structures and multiple reactions [217]. Yuzhi et al. [218] applied a laminated Porous Metal Fibre Sintered Felt (PMFSF) working as catalyst support in a cylindrical methanol steam reforming microreactor for hydrogen production. The PMFSF was built by the low temperature solid-phase sintering method using metal fibers, such as copper fibers and aluminum fibers acquired by the multi-tooth cutting method. In another work, Zhou et al. [219] used cascading metal foams as catalyst supports for assembling a new type of cylindrical laminated methanol steam reforming microreactor for H2 production. A straightforward two-layer impregnation method was used to load the Cu/Zn/Al/Zr catalysts. In comparison with two other types of catalyst placement studied, the microreactor which contained the catalyst-loaded metal foams presented the highest performance in H2 production. When the pores per inch of the metal foam were increased from 50 to 100, both the CH3OH conversion and the H2 flow rate production constantly improved. The results showed that a microreactor with Cu foam as catalyst support presents enhanced H2 production and better stability than a microreactor with the Ni foam. It is worth emphasizing that packed bed microreactors for methanol reforming allow the use of commercial catalysts with moderate cost, improved catalyst availability and reproducibility, and a greater understanding of catalyst performance, which is valuable in the industry [220]. A further investigation conducted by Karim et al. [221] showed a comparison between the packed bed and coated wall microreactors. Different dimensions of both reactor configurations were tested, and the transport limitations were investigated using 2D reactor models. The modeling results showed that the reactor volumetric productivity increases with thicker catalyst wall coatings for a constant reactor diameter. To sum up, the coated wall microreactor offers a better result to achieve low-pressure drops and enhanced catalyst activity compared to a packed bed microreactor. One of the key advantages of applying flow microreactors for methanol steam reforming is the improved mass transfer they offer. Pore diffusion limitations can be absent in a packed bed reactor if small-sized catalyst pellets are used. Furthermore, higher CH3OH conversions can be achieved by using smaller pellets. However, the use of tiny pellets can cause excessive pressure drops across conventional reactors. Flow microreactors often eliminate the issue of large pressure drops due to their small dimensions and enhance the mass transfer. As far as Steam Reforming of Methanol (SRM) for hydrogen production is concerned, only a few examples (in lab-scale) of continuous flow reactors for thermophotocatalysis can be found in the literature. Han et al. [222] realized efficient H2 evolution by SRM, a reaction temperature of at least 150 °C is needed. In this work, thermophotocatalytic SRM is carried out in a flow-type system, with a Xe lamp as a light source. In this type of a closed-circuit system, the selectivity can be maintained while the catalytic efficiency can be further enhanced. By this approach, the efficient steam reforming of methanol can be obtained over Pt/SrTiO3 at temperatures approx. 150 °C in a thermophotocatalytic fashion. The Pt nanoparticles serve as light-to-thermal conversion agents, whereas the SrTiO3 support provides dispersity and neutralizes deactivation of the Pt nanoparticles [222]. Hybrid photo-thermal-catalytic reforming of methanol was investigated by Khani et al. [223] on Cu/TiO2 nanocatalysts. The obtained results indicated that methanol conversion (at 150 °C) was remarkably increased by coupled roles of the photo and thermal catalysis (about 36 % in the presence of light). The critical issue in hybrid photothermalcatalytic reforming reactors is the ability of the reactor to pass the light. As a matter of fact, since monolithic reactors are formed by a series of connected channels, they have advantages such as passing light, low pressure drop, heat and mass transfer, and suitable contact between the reactants and catalyst surface [224,225]. Ruthenium – anatase materials with noble metal loadings from 1 to 10 wt. % was tested by Caudillo-Flores et al. [226] in the gas phase thermo-photo production of hydrogen using methanol as a sacrificial agent. The activity of the Ru/TiO2 samples show a strong synergistic effect when light and heat are used jointly as energy source for the hydrogen production process. The highest thermo-photo effect is obtained for 5 wt% Ru/TiO2 at 240 °C with significant advantages from the use of thermal or photonic alone energy sources. In this investigation, the authors used a gas-phase continuous flow annular thermo-photoreactor (made of Pyrex) where the catalyst (ca. 0.4 mg/cm2) was supported onto the internal wall of the tube as a thin layer (during thermo-catalytic and thermo-photo-catalytic tests, the film was heated using a cartridge heater) from a suspension in ethanol. Han and Hu [227] developed a black Pt/TiO2 catalyst on the light-diffuse-reflection-surface of a SiO2 rectangle disk substrate (1.4 cm × 2.9 cm), which was located in a quartz reactor (diameter: 1.5 cm). To test the temperature-induced photocatalytic hydrogen production, the reactor was heated to a selected temperature (from 150 to 300 °C) using an electrical furnace, water (with 30 % methanol as a sacrificial agent) fed into the reactor, and the catalyst irradiated by 1 Sun (100 mW/cm2, simulated by AM 1.5 G solar simulator) with irradiation area of 4 cm2 (Test unit schematic on Fig. 30 ) [227]. Han’s and Hu’s findings demonstrated the following: (1) surface-diffuse-reflected-light was 100 times more efficient than incident light for photocatalysis; (2) it's kinetic limitation was the reason for the low efficiency of absorbed visible light for the photocatalytic H2 product from water with a sacrificial agent; and (3) the coupling between the dispersion of black Pt/TiO2 catalyst on a light-diffuse-reflection-surface and an elevated reaction temperature created a highly efficient temperature-induced visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production from water (with methanol as a sacrificial agent), giving a photo hydrogen yield of 497 mmol/h ∙ gcat and apparent quantum efficiency of 65.7 % for the whole visible light range at 280 °C. In another interesting work, SiO2/Ag@TiO2 nanocomposites prepared by Gao et al. [228] were designed to produce hydrogen and freshwater from seawater. Because of the LSPR effect and its core-shell structure, this nanoparticle absorbs nearly full spectrum of Sun irradiation. In this work, sacrificial reagents, such as glucose, methanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol, were tested under laboratory conditions. Additionally, a PTC-type reactor was also designed and operated under the Sun irradiation to probe the feasibility (see Fig. 31 ). The maximum hydrogen generation rate from the simulated seawater-glycerol solution was 13.3 mmol/h ∙ gcat at the highest reaction temperature of 100 °C. The results gave evidence of synergetic photothermal mechanisms under natural sunlight. We are far from having real solutions to the industrial production of hydrogen by thermophotocatalysis, and we cannot rely solely on trial-and-error strategies to solve the challenges ahead. However, improving the fundamental understanding of the plasmonic-based thermophotocatalytic mechanism connected with the design and fabrication of the proper continuous flow thermophotocatalytic reactor (bringing out the advantages of plasmonic thermophotocatalysis), we may accelerate the process of making hydrogen a reality."
11,Summary and outlook,"The need for development of a sustainable, benign and efficient photocatalytic production of hydrogen has been growing rapidly year after year. Obviously, the hydrogen produced from the wet reforming of methane or water electrolysis is commonly available, but at the same time, its production requires significant energy input. In this regard, LSPR-assisted thermophotocatalysis offers an enticing alternative solution to the problem. The ability of plasmonic nanomaterials to efficiently collect UV–vis electromagnetic radiation within nanoscale volumes is doubtlessly the most critical for a successful use of these building blocks in the design of hybrid photocatalysts for the production of solar fuels. This property of plasmonic nanomaterials enable a selective amplification of the intensity of a diffused electromagnetic field in close proximity to the composite photocatalyst, where photocatalytic reactions occur (typically the solid/liquid or solid/gas interface). It has been also demonstrated that through manipulation of the resonant wavelength, the chemical composition, size and shape of plasmonic nanostructures, it is possible to harvest the entire solar spectrum and to shift the absorption edge of hybrid photocatalysts to the extent that is inaccessible to bare semiconductor. Unique features of plasmonic nanostructures enable an efficient transmission of energetic electrons into the adsorbed species, increasing the rate of chemical reactions on the surface of the plasmonic nanomaterials. Nevertheless, some challenges have to be faced in order to fully control the plasmonic photochemistry, reach the maximum possible hydrogen production yield/selectivity, and ultimately overcome the economical barrier that hinder large scale commercialisation of plasmonic thermophotocatalysis. A plenty of recent examples have provided some insights into various factors that play a significant role in LSPR-assisted chemical transformations on plasmonic nanostructures, but accurate theoretical models that can quantify individual contributions from different factors and guide the design of highly efficient photocatalysts need to be developed. Such models should possess a predictive power and should be able to describe the elementary steps involved in a photocatalytic transformation, the relationships between the generation rate of hot carriers and the geometry of building blocks, as well as the dynamics of excited energetic charge carriers. For example, first-principles ab initio simulations are crucial to gain further understanding of the direct electron transfer effect, which is critical to achieve high efficiency of plasmonic photocatalysts despite relatively short lifetime of hot carriers. Further development of DFT-based computational tools capable of sampling the energy landscape of adsorbed molecules, especially in the excited state, is mandatory to predict beneficial reaction pathways that can be accessed via LSPR. On the other hand, FEM or FDTD methods would be helpful in meso-scale computational design of novel plasmonic heterostructures (for example antenna reactors) dedicated to thermophotocatalytic hydrogen production and mediate a successful synthesis of such materials. Another very important factor that may potentially question the validity of industrial implementation of LSPR-assisted thermophotocatalytic hydrogen production is the plasmonic material itself. A commonly known noble metallic NPs such as gold or platinum are very expensive and of limited availability; therefore, plasmonic nanostructures based on earth abundant elements need to be developed. Besides, such a plasmonic nanostructure should be stable at operation conditions and should sustain the LSPR as operation time goes on. In particular, keeping the LSPR present in time is challenging since under typical reaction conditions the metallic NPs can be easily oxidized and as a result, loose their LSPR characteristics. The potential remedy for this problem may be the application of metal oxides NPs exhibiting metallic electronic structure or easily reducible metal oxides featuring the LSPR in the desired spectral region. Ultimately, significant advancements in the field of photoreactor engineering are necessary. Specifically, the attention should be focused on the development of continuous-flow reactors where optimal chamber geometries and designs enable efficient use of solar flux and suitable thermal control. We hope that all these fundamental problems will be soon overcome, and this review will inspire both, the scientific and industrial communities, to successfully implement the LSPR-assisted thermophotocatalytic production of hydrogen."
