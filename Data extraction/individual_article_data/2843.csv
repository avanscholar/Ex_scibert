0,Introduction,"Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH) to benzaldehyde (BzH) is an important route to manufacture high value-added organic products [1,2]. Excellent efficiency has been achieved using conventional catalysts such as noble metals in O2. However, the noble metals are too expensive for real applications [3,4], and due to the inertness of O2 molecules, high reaction temperature or addition of promoters such as HNO3 is required to attain an ideal BzH yield. In order to tackle those problems, low-cost transition metals and nanocarbons could be applied as alternative catalysts [5–10]. Also, peroxide oxidants such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and peroxymonosulfate (PMS, basically available as a triple salt of potassium KHSO5·1/2KHSO4·1/2K2SO4, oxone) have been studied for liquid-phase organic oxidation reactions to replace oxygen gas [11–13]. These peroxides can be activated under mild conditions for oxidative reactions. However, liquid H2O2 and TBHP may have safety issues and high cost in transportation and storage, and thus a stable crystal solid chemical, PMS, has received intensive attention for both selective and non-selective oxidation reactions [14]. PMS has an excellent potential for numerous fundamental reactions of synthetic chemistry such as selective oxidation of C–H bonds of olefins and alcohols to obtain the corresponding oxygenated compounds [11]. However, extra additives are required to activate PMS to form more reactive and selective oxidizing species to accomplish a high yield of target products in these cases [15–21]. In recent years, activation of PMS by carbon-based metal-free catalysts has been proposed and extensively studied in the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for water treatment [22]. The sp2 hybridized carbocatalysts with surface carbonyl groups can induce the generation of various radicals including SO4 •− (2.5–3.1 V), SO5 •− (1.1 V) and •OH (2.7 V), which can non-selectively attack the aqueous organics [23–26]. Furthermore, non-radical AOPs owing to the direct electron transfer from the target organics to PMS via the sp2 carbon framework have also been reported [27]. However, the reported PMS activation by carbocatalysts was dominantly applied to wastewater treatment and rarely used for organic synthesis. Unlike the radical-based AOPs, the non-radical pathway sheds lights on the feasibility of applying PMS in the selective oxidation. Via catalyst modification, the electron transfer ability and oxidative potentials of the PMS-carbocatalyst-organics systems can be tailored to replace the precious metal catalysts and expensive/unstable oxidants, thus achieving the selective oxidations in an environmentally benign manner. Previously, we reported carbon nanotubes for PMS activation toward BzOH selective oxidation [28]. Dominated by a radical process, this facile reaction could be conducted without adding any other co-catalysts or additives under benign conditions. However, the BzH yield was still not ideal due to minor mineralization of BzOH into inorganics by the highly oxidizing radicals, reducing the selectivity to BzH. Thus, it is inspiring to improve oxidative efficiency via non-radical routes. BzH was known to be unstable owing to the presence of the aldehyde group and readily suffers from autoxidation into benzoic acid (BzOOH) even under air exposure [29]. Therefore, over-oxidation was a major concern for BzH in the selective oxidation of BzOH. Very unexpectedly, no by-product of BzOOH was detected, mirroring that further oxidation of the BzH into BzOOH did not occur in the carbon nanotube/PMS system [28], while the reason for the selectivity not reaching 100% should be that a minimum amount of BzOH completely oxidized into CO2 as in most reported AOPs. The reaction behavior of BzOH and BzH towards the radical/non-radical oxidation by PMS deserves further research to gain a comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic reaction mechanism and to provide guidance for the catalyst design. Nitrogen-doped carbon materials have been reported as efficient metal-free catalysts for PMS activation in AOPs, especially via the non-radical pathway [27]. The nature of carbon catalysts, including the surface functional groups and the electrochemical properties, could be tailored for improved catalytic efficiency. However, the identification of active sites on doped graphene catalysts was usually focused on either N or O species, while the study regarding the synergistic effect of integrated functional groups on the catalytic performance has rarely been reported. Herein, we present an investigation on tailoring the integrated functionalities of N-doped graphene oxides (NGO) and their application in highly selective oxidation of BzOH to BzH. The non-radical oxidation process was significantly enhanced by tuning the surface functionalities to gain a high BzH selectivity. The different reaction pathways towards the oxidative NGO/PMS system were explored deeply. The underlined role of BzOH against the undesired over-oxidations was also clarified. Thus, the current work paved a new way for highly efficient and green carbocatalysis for more valuable chemical synthesis."
1,Experimental procedures,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Graphite powder, active carbon (AC) and nanodiamond (ND) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were purchased from Timesnano, China. Peroxide hydroxide (∼30%) was obtained from Chem-supply. The other chemicals were supplied by Sigma Aldrich."
3,N-doped carbocatalyst synthesis,"2.2 N-doped carbocatalyst synthesis Graphene oxide (GO) was first synthesized from graphite using the Hummers’ method. N-doped graphene (NGO) was then obtained by impregnation and annealing. In a typical process, 1 g GO was finely ground and mixed with 1 g urea in a certain amount of water. The mixture was maintained at room temperature for 12 h and then dried at 60 °C. The product was annealed at 400 °C for 2 h under N2 protection in an electric furnace. Then the black powder was fully washed by water and ethanol and dried at 60 °C for 24 h to obtain NGO. Other carbon substrates were prepared by the following procedures. One gram MWCNTs (or SWCNTs/ND) were added into a mixture of 45 mL H2SO4 (95–98%) and 15 mL HNO3 (65–68%) and sonicated for 5 h at 25 °C. Then the precipitate was filtered and thoroughly washed by deionized water. The black carbon nanotubes were dried at 60 °C for 48 h to obtain O-MWCNT (O-SWCNT or O-ND). Then the O-MWCNT, O-SWCNT, AC and O-ND were employed as different carbon sources to prepare the corresponding N-doped carbocatalysts with a similar process as NGO. In addition, N (Melamine)-GO and N(NH4NO3)-GO were also synthesized by replacing urea with the same mass loading of melamine and NH4NO3 as N precursors. Hydrogen peroxide, PMS and KMnO4 were then used as oxidants for the post-oxidation treatments of NGO, separately. For the synthesis of NGO-H2O2, 0.5 g NGO was added into 50 mL H2O2 and stirred under 50 °C for 5 h. After cooling down, the solid was filtered, washed and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The formation of NGO-PMS and NGO-KMnO4 was carried out with the similar method and the mixture was composed of 0.5 g NGO, 0.5 mol oxidant and 50 mL water. In addition, preparation of CO-rich NGO with inorganic additives (NGO-A/N, NGO-A/Cl, NGO-A/C, NGO-Mg/N, NGO-Fe/N and NGO-Ca/N) was conducted with the same procedure as NGO except that 3.8 mmol of inorganic salts were added into the mixture at the impregnation step."
4,The passivation of carbonyl groups,"2.3 The passivation of carbonyl groups The elimination of carbonyl groups on NGO and NGO-H2O2 was conducted in the following process. Firstly, 100 μL HCl (38%) and 0.5 g phenylhydrazine (PH) were dissolved in 10 mL CHCl3, followed by adding 0.1 g NGO. The mixture was stirred under N2 atmosphere at 60 °C for 48 h in dark. The precipitate was then thoroughly rinsed with CHCl3 and ethanol to remove the residual PH. Then the solid was dried at 60 °C for 24 h to obtain NGO-PH. The NGO–H2O2–PH was prepared in the similar procedure."
5,Selective oxidation of BzOH,"2.4 Selective oxidation of BzOH The catalytic evaluations of selective oxidation of BzOH were performed as follows. In a typical catalytic process, 5 mg catalyst was mixed with 2.5 mL water and 2.5 mL acetonitrile in a flask and maintained under sonication for 5 min. Then, 0.11 mmol oxone and 0.1 mmol BzOH were added into the flask, which was sealed and maintained at 50 °C. After 5 h, the reactor was cooled down and was injected of 0.1 mmol anisole as an internal standard. The mixture after the reaction was filtered and the organic phase was extracted by toluene and analyzed with GC."
6,Materials characterizations,"2.5 Materials characterizations Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on a JEOL 2100 microscope. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out using a Zeiss Neon 40EsV FIBSEM. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD system at a base pressure of 1 × 10−8 torr with Al Kα radiation. The binding energies were referenced to the C1s line at 284.6 eV. Raman spectra of graphene samples were obtained on a Renishaw Raman spectrometer under ambient conditions using a 785 nm laser beam. Fourier transforms infrared spectra (FTIR) were obtained on a Bruker spectrometer. In-situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were derived on a Bruker EMS-plus instrument using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as the radical trapping agent."
7,Results and discussion,"For fundamental understanding of the significant roles of the individual functional groups (i.e., N and O species) on the catalysts in the catalytic reactions, a series of techniques were employed to modify graphene with varying functionalities and contents. In addition, a variety of designed reactions were performed to fully understand the oxidation behavior."
8,Design and synthesis of carbocatalysts with tailored N–O functionalities,"3.1 Design and synthesis of carbocatalysts with tailored N–O functionalities Urea was chosen in this work as it was one of the superior N precursors for the preparation of N-doped carbocatalysts in PMS activation [30]. The selective oxidation reaction of BzOH was performed in acetonitrile/water solution at moderate temperature (50 °C) in the presence of PMS. Several carbon substrates were employed including GO, MWCNTs, SWCNTs, AC and ND. Their corresponding N-doped catalysts were synthesized by an incipient impregnation and thermal decomposition method. The effects of the N doping into different carbon materials on the catalytic performance were investigated (Table S1). N doped GO achieved 22-fold enhancement of BzH yield (33.6%) compared with N-free GO (1.5%), while for the other carbon materials, the enhancement was below 3-fold. The information of N content on the catalysts was obtained from an elemental analysis of the XPS survey. With equal urea loading (urea: carbon source = 1, mass ratio), the surface N content in N-doped GO reached 9.6% while for the other carbons, the N content was less than 3.1%, indicating that the structural nature of GO was superior to the other carbons in attaining more surface N species. The influence of the N precursor loading (urea, from 10 to 200 wt%) suggested that, at the weight ratio of urea/GO over 1, the content of N species on N-doped GO was saturated and the catalytic performance showed no obvious change by further increased urea dosage (Fig. S1). Therefore, the N-doped GO prepared with an equal mass ratio of urea:GO (denoted as NGO) was selected as the catalyst for subsequent investigation and discussion. After urea doping, the oxygen concentration on GO substantially dropped from 28.8 to 8.2%. In comparison, a control sample (GO-400) was prepared with the same procedure as NGO without urea loading. The oxygen concentration of GO-400 (15.0%) exceeded NGO (8.2%) by a large scale, indicating that the inserted N species led to the loss of oxygen groups. Notably, both BzOH conversion and BzH selectivity increased with higher N dosage, indicating the incorporated N species might result in higher conversion/selectivity. SEM and TEM images (Figs. S2a and b) revealed the morphology of highly exfoliated graphene sheets with winkled structures, which were commonly observed on N-doped graphene [24,30]. The nano-scaled thin layer structure enabled fast mass and charge transfer during the catalytic reactions. Further high-angle annular dark-field scanning (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig. S2c left) and elemental mapping (Fig. S2c, right) indicated the uniform distributions of the abundant N and O species on NGO. The N species on carbon materials were composed of different types, such as graphitic or quaternary N, pyrrolic N, pyridinic N and amine. Previous research suggested that the quaternary N served as the active site for PMS activation in AOPs, especially endowing the non-radical pathway [27]. Besides, the ketonic CO groups on oxygenated carbo-catalysts also played an important role in PMS activation. The ketonic CO groups were electron-rich and thus performed as nucleophilic active sites in various reactions [31–33]. However, there was still a lack of comprehensive understanding of the catalytic role of the other N species and the correlation between the surface N and O groups. It was recently found that the electron affinity (electrophilic and nucleophilic) of surface functionalities on the catalyst played a significant role in PMS activation for selective oxidation of BzOH by facilitating the electron transfer between the PMS and carbon catalysts [28]. In this regard, it was a logical consideration to develop highly active carbon catalysts with both electrophilic and nucleophilic groups to form an electron bridge to further promote the electron transfer from the target organics to PMS. The surface chemistry of NGO was investigated by XPS (Fig. 1 ). The deconvolution of N 1s spectra of NGO showed that 50% of the N species were pyridinic N (398.5 eV), whereas the quaternary N at around 401.3 eV only contributed 14% (Fig. 1c, bottom). The peak around 400 eV could be assigned to pyrrolic or amine [7,34,35], but the N–H streching was not observed in FTIR spectra of NGO (Fig. S3), so this peak was assignd to tertiary amine. It has been reported that the pyridinic N could induce p-type domains on graphene oxide [36] to withdraw electrons from the adsorbed electron-rich molecules. In this sense, the electron-withdrawing pyridinic N and the electron-rich CO groups might facilitate adsorption of BzOH/PMS to form an electron tunnel for the electron transfer from BzOH to PMS. The O 1s XPS spectra of NGO could be fitted into two peaks of C–O and CO species with a relatively low CO/C–O ratio of 0.4 (Fig. 1b, bottom), indicating that the surface oxygen functionalities on NGO were dominantly composed of C–O species. The C–O/CO ratio of carbon materials significantly relied on the oxidizing environment [31,37], which provides possibilities to improve the catalytic performance via optimizing the N and O functionalities. In order to increase the concentration of CO groups on NGO, oxidation treatment was carried out using three typical oxidants (H2O2, KMnO4 and PMS) and the samples were denoted as NGO-H2O2, NGO-KMnO4 and NGO-PMS, respectively. The N content of the catalysts and their catalytic activities in the selective oxidation of BzOH are summarized in Table 1 . GO was ineffective in BzOH oxidation (entry 2) compared with the catalyst-free test (entry 1). Annealed GO without urea dopant (GO-400, entry 3) barely improved the catalytic performance. N doping on GO (NGO, entry 4) profoundly increased the BzOH conversion (42.9%) and BzH yield (33.6%) with a relatively high selectivity of 78.3%, indicating that the enhanced catalytic activity of NGO was attributed to the N doping. The post-oxidation of NGO further increased catalytic performances. Notably, the BzH selectivity kept over 90% for the three samples (entries 6,7,8). Among the three oxidized catalysts, NGO-KMnO4 presented the lowest catalytic activity because KMnO4 caused a severe loss of the surface N species (from 9.6 to 2.4%). The BzH yield of NGO-H2O2 reached 52.2%. However, GO-400-H2O2 presented no improvement in catalytic activity (entry 5), indicating that both N and O played crucial roles. BzH was the only organic product detected from GC-MS analysis, thus most of BzH was free from over-oxidation into BzOOH. Raman spectra were adopted to evaluate the graphitic degree of the graphene-based catalysts with the peak intensity ratio of D and G (I D/I G) as an indicator (Fig. S4) [38]. After the N-doping, the I D/I G increased from 1.09 (GO) to 1.42. A shoulder peak (D’) appeared near the G band after the N doping, which could be assigned to the disordered graphitic lattice on the surface graphene layers [39]. The post-oxidation with H2O2 caused a negligible increase of I D/I G (1.44). It could be inferred that the enhanced catalysis after H2O2 treatment was not induced by the change of structural defects. The total oxygen content of NGO increased after post-oxidation treatments (Table 1) because more oxygen species were generated on NGO. The deconvolution of C 1s [35,40–42], O 1s [31] and N 1s [7,34,35] XPS spectra revealed the evolution of the surface N and O states before and after the post-oxidation treatment. For the C 1s XPS spectra of NGO, NGO-PMS and NGO-H2O2 (Fig. 1a), the latter two samples had stronger intensity in the binding energy range of 286–290 eV than NGO, which was dominantly attributed to the generation of oxygenated groups. Then the O 1s and N 1s spectra were deconvoluted to gain detailed information of the composition of O and N species. The O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 1b) further confirmed that the post-oxidation treatment led to the conversion of C–O into CO on NGO with a higher CO/C–O ratio (NGO: 0.40, NGO-PMS: 1.41 and NGO-H2O2: 1.13) whereas there was no visible variation of the composition of N species (Fig. 1c). From the above results, the CO groups were suggested to play a critical role in N-doped graphene catalysis and synergistically worked with the active N species for PMS activation."
9,Identification of active sites and mechanism of the catalytic routes,"3.2 Identification of active sites and mechanism of the catalytic routes For identifying the catalytic roles of active N and O species and reaction pathway, different N precursors (melamine and NH4NO3) were used to prepare more NGO and H2O2 treated NGO samples. The XPS elemental analysis, N 1s deconvolution species and the catalytic performance of the relevant catalysts are presented in Table S2 and Fig. S5. The N content on melamine derived N-GO was as high as 36.2%, dominantly composed of quaternary N (71%), with only 12% pyridinic N. The BzH yield over melamine derived N-GO reached 29.6%, slightly lower than that of urea derived NGO (33.6%). However, after post-oxidation by H2O2, the N content slightly reduced to 33.7% without apparent changes of the composition of N species, and the BzH yield decreased to 24.5%. For NH4NO3 derived N-GO, the total N concentration was 6.4% and was composed of 39% pyridinic N and 23% quaternary N. After H2O2 treatment, a considerable loss of pyridinic N occurred (quaternary N: 32%; pyridinic N: 26%; total N content: 4.2%), probably due to the unstable N-graphene configuration derived from NH4NO3. As a consequence, the BzH yield dramatically decreased from 16.7 to 4.2%. These results further confirmed the pivotal role of pyridinic N on NGO in PMS activation for BzOH oxidation. The carbonyl groups on carbon materials could be selectively deactivated by phenylhydrazine (PH) via a specific reaction (Fig. S6) [43]. The CO groups reacted with hydrazine to form a –CN–N- structure, leading to the increased N concentration. The N and O contents of NGO and NGO-H2O2 before and after the CO deactivation are illustrated in Table 1, entries 9 and 10. For NGO-H2O2, the increase of N concentration (+3.1%) and decrease of O concentration (−1.7%) after the PH treatment was more significant than NGO (+1.2% and −0.2%), confirming that the CO species on NGO were enriched after H2O2 post-oxidation. As expected, NGO and NGO-H2O2 suffered from a sharp decrease in both BzOH conversion and BzH selectivity owing to the deactivated CO groups. Notably, the PH treated NGO and NGO-H2O2 showed similar catalytic efficiency, revealing that the enhanced catalytic performance by post-oxidation treatment was attributed to the created CO groups. At this stage, the essential role of CO species on NGO was verified and CO was responsible for the improved conversion/selectivity. The evolution of radicals during the activation of PMS was probed by EPR. Very weak signals of radicals were observed in EPR spectra without a catalyst and the generation of sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals was greatly enhanced upon the addition of NGO-H2O2 as suggested in Fig. S7. A series of quenching tests were also performed for an in-depth understanding of the reaction pathways (radical/non-radical) in this system. Ethanol was employed as a strong quenching agent for both hydroxyl and sulfate radicals while tert-butanol (TBA) served as an effective •OH scavenger [28]. The quenching effect of ethanol dosage on the reaction performances over NGO and NGO-H2O2 was presented in Fig. 2 a and b. A rapid drop of BzOH conversion and BzH yield was observed with increased dosage of ethanol, suggesting the importance of the radicals in selective oxidation of BzOH into BzH. When the acetonitrile solvent was completely replaced by ethanol, BzH selectivity increased remarkably and NGO-H2O2 possessed a higher BzH yield (29.1%) than NGO (14.1%). This suggests the BzOH oxidation was performed with both radical and non-radical routes and the non-radical oxidation route enables higher selectivity towards BzH. The addition of TBA only caused a slight decrease of reaction efficiency relative to ethanol (Fig. S8). Therefore, sulfate radicals were suggested to be more effective for the selective oxidation of BzOH than hydroxyl radicals. Moreover, the different contributions of non-radical and radical processes to the BzH yield could also be roughly determined by assuming that the BzH yield in the maximum ethanol dosage experiment was due to the non-radical reaction. Both the non-radical and radical processes were enhanced after post-oxidation of NGO and the non-radical reaction showed a more significant increase (Fig. S9). It could be inferred that the radical and non-radical processes were simultaneously facilitated by the enriched CO groups, and the non-radical oxidation route was more selective in BzOH oxidation. Likewise, the role of N species in the radical/non-radical process was investigated by altering the urea dosage during NGO preparation (from 10 to 100%, Fig. S10). Similarly, both radical and non-radical reaction rates increased with a higher N content. These results revealed that the CO and N species were actively involved in both radical and non-radical oxidation reactions. As the carbocatalyst-mediated electron transfer was crucial for the non-radical pathway, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were conducted to measure the electrochemical properties of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2c, in the presence of PMS/BzOH, the electron transfer ability of the catalysts followed an order of NGO-H2O2 > NGO > GO, agreeing well with the catalytic performance especially the non-radical oxidation. In addition, NGO-H2O2 possessed better stability in comparison with our previously reported carbocatalysts [28], with only 7.9% decrease in BzOH conversion and 7.7% decrease in BzH yield after 4 runs (Fig. 2d), indicating that most of the active sites were well maintained after the reaction. Fig. S11 suggests that the oxygen content of the used catalyst (13.4 at.%) was slightly higher than the fresh one (9.4 at.%), due to the surface oxidation of catalyst in PMS environment (such as the transformation of C–O/CO into O–CO), which could possibly lead to the minor deactivation [44]."
10,Preparation of the CO-rich NGO with inorganic additives,"3.3 Preparation of the CO-rich NGO with inorganic additives For further confirmation of the hypothesis, a one-step method was developed to prepare a CO-rich NGO catalyst from GO by introducing additives during the preparation. A solid-state synthesis method has been reported, employing magnesium nitrate to produce reduced GO and annealed CNTs based MgO-nanocarbon hybrids with high CO concentration [45,46]. In this work, both non-metallic salts including NH4NO3 (A/N), NH4Cl (A/Cl), NH4HCO3 (A/C) and metallic nitrate salts were tested individually as additives with urea to prepare the CO-rich NGO. The ketonic CO content was greatly enhanced by the addition of non-metal salts (Fig. S12a). Likewise, similar results were observed when replacing the non-metal salts with Mg(NO3)2, Ca(NO3)2 and Fe(NO3)3 (Fig. S13). The FTIR spectra of NGO-A/N exhibited an obvious increase of CO groups at 1716 cm−1 compared with NGO [47–49], confirming the successful generation of CO (Fig. S3). It was inferred that loading either non-metallic or metallic salts into the NGO preparation could enrich the ketonic CO groups, possibly due to the etching of graphene sheets by the decomposition of the salt, which led to more defect sites for the selective generation of CO. The nitrogen showed no significant compositional variation by the additives (Fig. S12b). In terms of the catalyst evaluation, all the applied inorganic salts were able to enhance the catalytic efficiency (Table 1, Table S3). The BzH selectivity and yield were raised to over 90% and 50% by the addition of salts in the catalyst preparation. NGO-A/N showed the best reactivity after 3 h reaction at the PMS/BzOH molar ratio of 1.1 to generate BzH in 59.1% yield and 95.3% selectivity, superior to NGO-H2O2 (Table 1, entries 8 and 11). The LSV measurements showed that the additives of non-metallic and metallic salts could enhance the electron transfer efficiency of NGO (Fig. S14). The cycling/stability tests (Fig. S15) and ethanol quenching results (Fig. S16) on NGO-A/N were also like these on NGO-H2O2. When the radicals were quenched with full ethanol dosage, 34.9% BzH yield was remained compared with 59.1% BzH yield from the no-quenching test, indicating that over half of the performed oxidation was originated from the non-radical reaction. These results provided convincing proofs to the previous conjecture that the N species and CO were co-active sites for BzOH oxidation in PMS activation. Besides, the oxidation reaction performed under various conditions by adopting NGO-A/N as the representative catalyst showed that the increased temperature, reaction time, catalyst and PMS dosage could lead to improved conversion of BzOH and yield of BzH (Table S4). The BzH selectivity remained almost at a similar level regardless of the change of reaction conditions, indicating that such a highly selective reaction system was robust and suitable for a wide range of working conditions. In this work, the highest BzH yield of 82% was obtained at a PMS/BzOH ratio of 2.5 with 96% BzOH conversion and 85.4% selectivity (Table 1, entry 12), which was the most effective in BzOH oxidation compared with various reaction systems in the previously reported works and the reaction temperature here was much lower (Table S5) [9,17,28,50]. Specifically, this performance was even superior to that of a noble-metal (Pd/Pb) catalyst with higher conversion (96 versus 91.3%) and lower temperature (50 versus 130 °C) [50]."
11,Catalytic mechanism elucidation,"3.4 Catalytic mechanism elucidation It is concluded from the above results that the pyridinic N and carbonyl CO are dual active sites in both radical and non-radical oxidation of BzOH into BzH. We speculate the non-radical reaction was accomplished by mediated electron transfer via the surface complex based on the test of LSV curves (another proof will be provided in the next section). It has been reported that the electrophilic pyridinic N shows strong basicity against the other N species and is prone to adsorb the –OH groups from alcohols to facilitate the oxidation [51]. Besides, PMS molecules could be activated on both electrophilic and nucleophilic functional groups. The adsorption of PMS on nucleophilic CO led to the rupture of O–O bond to deliver SO4 •− and •OH radicals [25], while the adsorption of PMS on electrophilic species could result in the O–H bond cleavage (H–OOSO3) to generate SO5 •− radicals for subsequent oxidations [28]. Therefore, a possible mechanism of the reaction pathways using the prepared NGO was schematically shown in Fig. 3 . The modified NGO was equipped with abundant pyridinic N and carbonyl species and could activate PMS for the selective oxidation of BzOH into BzH via both radical and non-radical processes. When the pyridinic N and CO species were located closely on the edges of graphene planes, the pyridinic N could induce electrophilic domains on adjacent graphene layers and attract the electron-saturated branch in BzOH whereas the electron-rich CO groups were related to the -O-O- configuration in PMS. The electron transfer from BzOH to PMS occurred subsequently through the highly conjugated π system of graphene to accomplish the non-radical pathway. BzH was produced from BzOH by donating two electrons to PMS and releasing two H atoms to the solvent. On the other hand, the isolated N and CO could adsorb and activate PMS by capturing electrons from PMS to generate SO5 •− radicals which could further decompose into SO4 •− radicals, or donating an electron to PMS to form SO4 •− and •OH radicals. The generated reactive radicals would subsequently react with BzOH to generate BzH. A plausible reaction pathway between BzOH and radicals is provided assuming that the radicals firstly attract an α–H from BzOH to derive the PhCHOH• radical, since the α–H from the BzOH molecules was reported to quench the radicals [29] (will be further verified in the next section). The catalyst maintained the electron balance and stability via the transfer of delocalized electrons in both radical and non-radical processes."
12,Underlined mechanism for BzH without deep-oxidation,"3.5 Underlined mechanism for BzH without deep-oxidation In theory, the oxidation of BzOH could result in the formation of BzH (marked by the blue arrow), or further oxidation product of BzOOH (marked by the red arrow) as displayed in Fig. 4 a. However, in this NGO/PMS system, the deep-oxidation of BzH into BzOOH was not observed. To fully understand the oxidation behavior, especially why BzH was free from deep-oxidation, the individual and competitive reactions of BzOH and BzH towards the PMS/NGO system were performed. Firstly, BzOH and BzH were individually loaded into the reaction system with different PMS dosage. When BzOH was the only reactant, its conversion was remarkably increased with higher PMS dosage (Fig. 4b). BzH was detected as the only organic product even at the 2.5-fold PMS dosage. However, with BzH as the oxidation substrate, BzH was selectively oxidized into BzOOH with 70–80% selectivity (Fig. 4c). A nearly linear relationship was observed between the BzH conversion and PMS concentration. Ethanol quenching tests were performed to probe the oxidation pathway of BzH, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4c. The BzH conversion was sharply reduced from 61.4% to 3.5% after adding ethanol. Therefore, the BzH to BzOOH reaction route in the PMS/NGO system was only applicable via radical processes in the absence of BzOH. The absence of non-radical oxidation of BzH is possibly because the aldehyde groups have weaker acidity than alcohols, thus the benzaldehyde adsorption on pyridinic N is hard to occur. Moreover, this observation suggests that the non-radical oxidation of BzOH was attributed to the electron-transfer via the surface-adsorbed chemicals instead of the widely reported singlet oxygen (1O2). The 1O2 was proven to be generated via the interaction of the catalyst and PMS, regardless of the organic reactant [52], thus the fact that BzH could only be oxidized by the radicals ruled out the possibility of the oxidation of BzOH by 1O2 since BzH possessed a more oxidizable nature than BzOH. When an identical amount of BzOH and BzH co-existed in the system, the ascending curve of BzOH conversion with the increased PMS dosage was observed (Fig. 4d), similar to Fig. 4b. However, the conversion of BzH was kept below 2% (calculated according to the selectivity level of Fig. 4b), indicating that BzH can hardly be oxidized due to the presence of BzOH (Fig. 4d and Fig. S17). Therefore, it was suggested that BzH is free from deep-oxidation during the selective oxidation of BzOH due to the unreacted BzOH serving as the terminating agent. It has been reported that the α–H from the BzOH molecules could quench the radicals and minimize the autoxidation of BzH [29], which might help explain the inhibitive effect of BzOH on the radical-based BzH oxidation. To prove that, identical amount of 1-phenylethanol, toluene and ethylbenzene were added to the BzH oxidation system individually to demonstrate the influence of the α–H-containing benzylic alcohol on BzH oxidation. All the added chemicals could inhibit the BzH oxidation, but the inhibition influence was associated with the chemical structures. The 1-phenylethanol molecule with one α–H was less effective in suppressing the BzH conversion compared with BzOH with two α–H (Fig. S18 and Fig. 4d), but still more inhibitive than toluene and ethylbenzene containing no hydroxyl α–H. These observations suggested that the benzylic alcohols with α–H was more reactive than aliphatic C–H towards the radicals and could inhibit the radical-chain oxidation of BzH. Overall, the selectivity of the BzOH to BzH in PMS/NGO reaction system could naturally reach a high level and the over-oxidation of BzH was blocked via both non-radical and radical routes."
13,Conclusions,"We report the development of carbonylated N-doped graphene catalysts for the selective conversion of BzOH into BzH by PMS with high efficiency under benign conditions. The surface CO groups were enriched by either post-oxidation treatment of NGO or adding inorganic salts during the preparation of NGO. BzOH conversion of 96% and BzH selectivity of 85.4% were achieved on an optimized carbocatalyst via both non-radical and radical processes. The experimental results indicated that the doped N species and carbonyl groups (CO) made joint contributions to the enhanced radical and non-radical activities, where the non-radical oxidation could afford higher BzH selectivity. The electron-withdrawing pyridinic N sites were integrated with carbonyl groups to build a bridge for the electron transfer from the adsorbed BzOH to PMS to accomplish the non-radical oxidation process. For the isolated pyridinic N and CO, each of these two functional groups could adsorb and activate PMS to generate various radicals for subsequent BzOH oxidation. Sulfate radicals played the dominant role for the radical-based BzOH oxidation. BzH remained to be the sole product due to the presence of unreacted BzOH, which could quench the radicals. This study revealed the intrinsic nature of the selective reaction via PMS/NGO system for BzOH conversion to BzH, which might provide a versatile strategy using such functionalized graphene catalysts for the selective oxidation of other organics."
