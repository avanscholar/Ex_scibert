0,Introduction,"Blend or hybrid composite/nanocomposite represent a promising class of materials that demonstrate a great potential in the industrial sector and biomedical applications (Jung et al., 2020). Composite materials often hold the partial characteristics of their parent components but through rational design, and careful maneuvering the critical parameters, they can overcome the shortcomings of their parent components and offer synergistic effects (Gbaguidi et al., 2020). The combination of diverse materials permits the construction of a hybrid composite that is capable of addressing the requirements of targeted sites or complex structures (Timofejeva et al., 2017). Comprehensive studies have been reported in developing composite or nanocomposite materials by utilizing polymers (natural or synthetic or both in combination) (Shanmugam et al., 2021; Silva et al., 2020), nanomaterials (Zepp et al., 2020), metal ions (Zahran & Marei, 2019), biomolecules (Gobi et al., 2021) etc. Polymers (synthetic or natural) have shown a tremendous applicability in numerous day-to-day life activities and healthcare systems, including tissue engineering applications (Maitz, 2015; Tang et al., 2014). Innumerable design approaches have been established to prepare biomaterials by using polymers as an essential matrix and incorporating nanomaterials, biomolecules, and different processing methods (Mahesh et al., 2021). Among various polymer types, alginate (AG) (natural) and poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (synthetic) have shown immense potential in fabricating blends or composites for various applications, such as waste-water treatments (e.g., metal absorption (Gao et al., 2020), dye absorption (Makhado & Hato, 2021), bioremediation (Zvulunov & Radian, 2021)), photocatalytic treatments (Yeo et al., 2020), drug delivery (Arora et al., 2020; Sood et al., 2017), tissue engineering (soft or hard) (Kumar & Han, 2017; Sahoo & Biswal, 2021), wound healing (Aderibigbe & Buyana, 2018; Bahadoran et al., 2020), foods and food packaging (de Farias et al., 2020; Senturk Parreidt et al., 2018), flame-retardant materials (Xu et al., 2021), fuel cells and batteries (Gouda et al., 2021), and other potential applications (Torres & De-la-Torre, 2021). Alginate is a hydrophilic biopolymer offering significant properties like non-toxicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and biostability that are explicitly suitable for biomedical applications (K. Y. (Lee & Mooney, 2012)). On the other hand, PVA with an excellent chemical resistance and physical properties have been extensively utilized in various industrial applications (e.g., fibres, textile, adhesive, protective colloids for emulsion polymerization, building binding agents), foods and food packaging, and biomedical applications (e.g., drug delivery, wound healing, and tissue engineering, cancer therapeutics) pertaining to its low-price, hydrophilicity, adequate mechanical properties, and cytocompatibility (Husain et al., 2018; Kumar & Han, 2021; Kumar et al., 2016; Thong et al., 2016). The application of these two polymeric materials have gained considerable interest from many research groups for their usage in diverse platforms due to their flexible design, tunable intrinsic properties, versatility as multifunctional responsive materials sensitive to external (physical and chemical) stimuli (Potaufeux et al., 2020). The aim of this review is to present a comprehensive outline of PVA and AG based composites (PVAG) as a potent matrix for miscellaneous applications. The review also concentrates on the significant properties of PVAG matrix that can be explored to maneuver its utility. Further, the review sheds light on the use of PVAG matrix for some key applications like drug delivery, tissue engineering, wastewater treatment, and wound healing. Finally, the future prospectives of the PVAG based matrix are discussed and innovative aspects that could be involved in further designing advanced PVAG matrices are summarized."
1,Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA),
2,Chemical Structure of PVA,"2.1 Chemical Structure of PVA PVA was firstly synthetized by Hermann and Haehnel in 1924 (Toyoshima & Finch, 1973). The monomer of PVA comprises of hydroxyl groups that govern the physicochemical attributes and impart the mechanical stability to PVA (Aslam et al., 2018). The monomeric unit of PVA is vinyl alcohol but it is not the base unit utilized for polymerization owing to its unstable nature. Instead, vinyl acetate serves as the base unit for polymerization process leading to PVA synthesis (Chana et al., 2008). Vinyl acetate undergoes partial hydrolysis involving fractional substitution of their ester groups with hydroxyl group in an alkaline environment resulting in the formation of PVA. The molecular weight of PVA varies from (20,000–400,000), which in turn depends on the chain length of vinyl acetate polymer, degree of replacement of acetate groups by hydroxyl groups upon hydrolysis and the processing environment (alkaline/acidic) (M. (Liu et al., 2016)). Different grades of PVA with diverse features (melting point, band gap, pH, viscosity, and refractive index) are thus formed based on the % hydrolysis and molecular mass (Liu et al., 2020)."
3,Synthesis and properties,"2.2 Synthesis and properties PVA is a non-ionic, synthetic polymer with environment-friendly, odorless, tasteless, and translucent nature (Saxena, 2004; Thong et al., 2016). The physical properties of PVA significantly depends on the degree of polymerization (DP) and degree of hydrolysis (DH) (Kumar et al., 2012a). Therefore, PVA can be categorized in two ways: (1) fully hydrolyzed PVA (hydroxyl groups: >98%) (Fig. 1 (a)) and partially hydrolyzed PVA (hydroxyl groups: ~85–89%) (Fig. 1(b)) (Toyoshima & Finch, 1973). Fully hydrolyzed PVA is soluble in hot water (80–90 °C) and exhibits good film forming ability with adhesive characteristics (Chan et al., 1999; Feldman, 2003). Moreover, partially hydrolyzed PVA is soluble in water at room temperature and moderately soluble in ethanol, but insoluble in organic solvents (Saxena, 2004). By crosslinking molecular chains of PVA, water resistant materials can be prepared (Thong et al., 2016). When compared to other polymers of its league, PVA exhibits inexplicable attribute of being an oxygen barrier; however, its sensitivity towards moisture could lead to its degradation and its permeability towards gases (Limpan et al., 2012)."
4,Processing of PVA,"2.3 Processing of PVA Numerous processing strategies are used for manufacturing PVA based composite materials with other polymers, nanomaterials, metal ions, biomolecules, and crosslinkers (Sirviö et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018b). Both, water based and organic solvent based strategies can be employed for making blends of PVA with other polymers (Jain et al., 2017; Thakur et al., 2019). The crosslinking of PVA chains has been processed through physical reaction (e.g., hydrogen bonding, crystallization by freeze-thaw cycles, ionic interactions, and protein interactions or design of graft copolymers) or chemical reactions (e.g., high-energy irradiation, enzymatic reaction) (Hennink & van Nostrum, 2012). However, physical crosslinking approach is more preferred as it avoids use of toxic chemical crosslinking agents, which might exhibit ill effects when used for biomedical applications."
5,Limitations,"2.4 Limitations PVA encompasses significant intrinsic properties that make it a potent choice for many research oriented applications. However, PVA is also allied with certain shortcoming that includes its thermal degradation kinetics. Researchers have also utilized thermal processing of PVA however; this has been a challenge as the melting temperature of PVA is very close to its degradation temperature resulting in thermal degradation (Thomas et al., 2018). In recent years, many studies undertaken have been focused to incapacitate this setback and also extended studies to further enhance knowledge in thermal degradation kinetics, nucleation and crystallization process associated with PVA (Hayashi et al., 2021; More, Ranglani, Kharche, & Kapusetti, 2020; Selvi et al., 2019) which could further widen the range of using PVA for various applications. Further, PVA based hydrogel formation has also been explored for biomedical applications ((Ben Halima, 2016); Kumar, Negi, Choudhary, & Bhardwaj, 2014). However, the chemicals used for crosslinking hydrogels tends to leach out which could present cytotoxicity as a vital limitation associated with PVA based hydrogels."
6,Alginate (AG),
7,Chemical structure,"3.1 Chemical structure Alginate is obtained from diverse sea microalgae sources (e.g., red, green, and brown seaweeds) and is available naturally in coastal areas of various countries (Łabowska, Michalak, & Detyna, 2019). In comparison to red and green seaweeds, cell walls of brown seaweed serve as the eminent source of insoluble salt of alginic acid (i.e. alginate) (Salmeán et al., 2017). In order to inflate its applicability, various approaches have been exploited to produce water-soluble alginate like sodium alginate. Water-soluble AG possesses remarkable rheological characteristics (e.g. gelling property, viscosifying ability, stabilization of dispersions). However, these properties are dependent on the chemical structure of alginates which are composed of a linear anionic polysaccharide containing β(1-4)-linked-D-mannuronic acid (M-blocks) and α(1-4)-linked-L-guluronic acid (G-blocks) residues in homogenic (GG or MM blocks) or heterogenic (MG blocks) patterns ((Coleman et al., 2011); Varaprasad, Jayaramudu, Kanikireddy, Toro, & Sadiku, 2020). The properties of AG remarkably depend on the ratio of M/G blocks, which also has considerable effect on the applicability of AG in numerous platforms (Sood, Gupta, & Agrawal, 2021). Studies have elaborated the effect of M/G ratios on the use of AG with domination of M block presenting linear and flexible conformation and introducing steric hindrance around the carboxylic functional groups due to (1-4)-linkages to guluronic acid. Further, G blocks facilitate folded and rigid structural conformation and provide a pronounced stiffness to the molecular chains. Study by Otterlei et al. demonstrated that high content of M blocks in AGs exhibits immunogenic behavior and are more dominant in inducing cytokines production compared to G blocks (Hernández-González, Téllez-Jurado, & Rodríguez-Lorenzo, 2020; (Otterlei et al., 1991)). In alginate structure, two secondary positions, C2-OH and C3-OH and one C6-COOH position can be selectively functionalized for derivatization that could be explored for composite formation. However, selective functionalization of AG is a challenging task due to the minute difference in reactivity of both reactive sites, whereas administration of reaction by selective functionalization of the guluronic and mannuronic block segments are easy to comprehend and execute ((Donati et al., 2003); J.-S. Yang, Xie, & He, 2011)."
8,Synthesis and properties,"3.2 Synthesis and properties AG exhibits a wide variety of chemical compositions thereby display different gelling properties (Guo, Wang, Qin, Shen, & Peng, 2020; Pina, Oliveira, & Reis, 2015; Rhein-Knudsen, Ale, Ajalloueian, & Meyer, 2017). The intrinsic viscoelasticity of AG varies in accordance with the originated blocks (Fig. 1 (c)). In this case, higher content of G blocks in AG produces brittle and strong gels, whereas higher content of M block in alginate results shrinkage in gel-network and larger flexibility. Furthermore, AG is incapable to form gels if the molar fraction of G block is less than 20–25% ((Petrova et al., 2019); Szekalska, Puciłowska, Szymańska, Ciosek, & Winnicka, 2016). AG are primarily extracted from brown algae such as Laminaria sp., Durvillaea sp., and Sargassum sp.) (Donati & Paoletti, 2009; Ramdhan, Ching, Prakash, & Bhandari, 2020). Among different alginates, sodium alginate (SA) has extensively been studied and used in pharmaceutical and biomedical areas ((Arora et al., 2020; Manatunga et al., 2017; Sood et al., 2017); Kumar, Rao, & Han, 2017a). The extraction of AG from sea-weeds is a multistage process involving the following four steps (1) drying and milling process, (2) treating with dilute mineral acid, (3) purification, and conversion of alginic acid to water-soluble sodium salt with the help of sodium carbonate, and (4) transformation of sodium salt of alginic acid back into acid or its salt for the extraction of sodium alginate (Sachan, Pushkar, Jha, & Bhattcharya, 2009). Alternatively, microbial fermentation has also been utilized to produce bacterial alginates with more defined physicochemical characteristics (Remminghorst & Rehm, 2006). AGs possess the DP of around 50-3000 that corresponds to molecular weight in the range of 10-600 kDa based on their sources, species, and extraction process ((Imeson, 2011); K. Y. (Lee & Mooney, 2012)). High molecular weight of AG facilitates rapid gelling rate, high viscosity, enhanced gel elasticity and strength (García et al., 2020). When average molecular weight of AG is less than 240 KDa, the AG gel strength improves with increasing molecular weight, whereas the improvement in gel strength is negligible when average molecular weight is higher than 240 KDa ((Farrés & Norton, 2014); Martinsen, Skjåk-Bræk, & Smidsrød, 1989). Further, due to the presence of carboxylic groups in their molecular chains, aqueous solutions of AGs are expected to demonstrate non-Newtonian property (Becker & Kipke, 2002) and exhibit pH-responsive characteristics (J. (Sun & Tan, 2013))."
9,Processing of alginate,"3.3 Processing of alginate AG is soluble in aqueous environment but is insoluble in organic solvents. The solubility of alginate in water mainly depends on four factors, (1) arrangement of G and M blocks in the polymer backbone, (2) solvent’s pH, (3) ionic strength associated with the system (except cations), and (4) the existence of cations. AG with higher content of G blocks exhibit higher aqueous solubility whereas, in acidic environment (low pH), higher content of MG blocks exhibits elevated solubility compared to AG having higher M or G content (Hu, Lu, Mata, Nishinari, & Fang, 2021; Jun (Liu et al., 2019)). AGs possess a characteristic feature of forming gel-networks (i.e. ionic gelation) in the presence of divalent cations (e.g., Ca2+ ion) that makes them a promising material for various potential applications, especially in biomedical areas (Ramdhan, Ching, Prakash, & Bhandari, 2019; D. (Sun et al., 2018); Kumar, Matari, & Han, 2020). Ca2+ ions selectively bind to the G blocks of the AGs and form 3D gel-networks (Agulhon, Robitzer, David, & Quignard, 2012), where one Ca2+ ion binds to four G residues and facilitates a hexagonal lattice, termed as an “egg-box” gel system (Fig. 2(a)) (Sikorski, Mo, Skjåk-Bræk, & Stokke, 2007). This Ca2+-mediated gelation mechanism of AG was first introduced by Grant et al. in 1973 (Grant, Morris, Rees, Smith, & Thom, 1973). The gel-network formation can be processed in two ways as: (1) external gelation (ex-situ) (Fig. 2 (b)) and (2) internal gelation (in-situ) (Fig. 2 (c)), depending on the introduction of Ca2+ ions into the AG matrix. Physical properties of Ca2+-mediated gelation of AG are guided by the alteration in temperature. The reduction in gelation temperature exhibits slow Ca2+ diffusion rate into AG matrix and facilitates more homogenous internal structure with enhanced gel strength (Jeong, Kim, Lee, Cho, & Kim, 2020). Despite the intensive use of Ca2+ ions, ionic gelation can be induced by various other monovalent (e.g., H+), divalent (e.g., Ba2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Sr2+), and trivalent (e.g., Fe3+ and Al3+) cations through different mechanisms compared to Ca2+ induced gelation of the AG. Here, the mechanism of monovalent ion-induced gelation of AG depends on the protonation of carboxyl groups. Divalent ions also bind with altered selectivity towards, G, M, and MG blocks, whereas trivalent ions bind to carboxyl groups with no selectivity. The resultant gel-networks using these mono/di/trivalent ions display significant variation in the intrinsic properties (mechanism, strength, viscoelasticity, and biocompatibility) (Hu et al., 2021; Urbanova et al., 2019)."
10,Limitations,"3.4 Limitations Despite the remarkable gel forming characteristic features and good encapsulation ability, AG is also accompanied with certain limitations. As an example, uncontrolled release of the encapsulated materials from AG matrix is observed due to the permeable and degradable porous gel-networks of AG (Matricardi, Meo, Coviello, & Alhaique, 2008). Also, the shrinkage of AG gels in acidic environment limits its encapsulation efficiency for water soluble molecules (e.g., drugs) and facilitates remarkably higher leakage of water-soluble molecules from the Ca2+-crosslinked AG network (Østberg, Lund, & Graffner, 1994). However, several studies have also reported that AG is significantly effective in protecting encapsulated materials in acidic environment, specifically in gastric fluid (Colom et al., 2017; Gunzburg et al., 2020). In addition, the phenomenon of syneresis is also witnessed during the formation of AG gels as a result of electrostatic attraction between COO− group of AG and Ca2+ ions (Mai, 2013). To overcome these limitations, other natural polymers or proteins can be incorporated to develop filled (with non-gelling materials), mixed (with gelling materials but do not interact), and complex (with oppositely charged materials and interact) gel-networks (Park, Kim, Choi, & Kim, 2018). Further, insolubility in organic solvents, high degradation rate, lack of active cell binding sites, and complicated extraction process are setbacks for the widespread usage of AG in numerous fields. AG tends to degrade at high alkaline/acidic environment, presents poor chemical selectivity for backbone modifications, and is susceptible to high temperature, which could result in uneven molecular weight of products. Constant efforts are being made to further improve AG via incorporation of pharmaceutical active molecules/biomolecules/nanoparticles to improve its biological, mechanical and structural properties."
11,Potential of PVA-AG (PVAG) as matrix,"3.5 Potential of PVA-AG (PVAG) as matrix PVA and AG have exclusively different characteristics with certain advantages and disadvantages but, if operated in combination as a matrix, they can promote remarkably enhanced and synergistically useful properties for numerous applications. The combination of alginate with good gelling characteristics and PVA with its crystallizing nature is very effectual in enhancing physicochemical and biological properties (Prakash et al., 2019). The gelation of Ca2+-mediated PVA/AG solution mixture through freeze-thaw cycles was reported which forms a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) at molecular scale, where Ca2+-mediated rigid alginate networks are dispersed and interlocked with ductile PVA network (X. (Li et al., 2018)) (Fig. 3 ). In the fabricated semi-IPN network, formation of hydrogen bonding existed primarily between the hydroxyl groups of PVA and the water molecules surrounding the network. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the different water molecules along with little intermolecular hydrogen-bonded cross-links formed between the hydrated PVA chains also existed. This composite system facilitates the overall improvement in strength and toughness of the matrix. The ductile matrix with hydrogen bonding bears small fractions of stresses across its elongations and dense Ca2+-crosslinked AG thereby provides a rigid skeleton to assist significantly large stresses upon its smaller local strains. This synergistic mechanism of semi-IPN is highly desired for various potential biomedical applications. PVAG matrix can be readily functionalized via ionic or covalent interaction or through physical adsorption in order to improve the physicochemical behavior of the matrix."
12,Various forms of PVAG based functional materials and their diverse applications,"Diverse forms of PVA and AG based matrices have been reported and utilized for numerous applications. The form of matrices is generally based on the targeted applications. Different forms of PVAG based matrices ranges from particle beads to 3D printed scaffolds. A comprehensive overview representing the different forms of PVAG based materials is shown in Fig. 4a. The PVAG matrix finds its applications in a variety of fields that include wastewater treatment, biomedical applications, fuel cells, photocatalysis, flame retardant materials and food packaging (Fig. 4b). The applicability of PVAG matrix in these key areas are discussed in details in the next section."
13,Wastewater treatments,"4.1 Wastewater treatments Environmental pollution is one of the major challenges to be tackled in the current scenario. Constant advancement in science and technology is a boon to the society but it also brings environmental hazards. Presence of heavy metals in our microenvironment could be associated with numerous health issues (Briffa, Sinagra, & Blundell, 2020). Heavy metals find its application in various industries including mining, fertilizer and pesticide industry, electrolysis, electroplating, leather industry, electrical machine manufacturing etc. Heavy metals are beyond inexorable in the environment when compared to organic contaminants. Heavy metals tend to accumulate in the living organisms due to its nonbiodegradable nature resulting in severe disorders (Rathour et al., 2019). Continuous research is being undertaken in the field of heavy metal removal from wastewater. In this regard, Zhang et al. prepared bead like structures comprising of core-shell arrangement of PVAG@polyacrylamide(PAM) by crosslinking PAM chains onto PVAG matrix for copper metal (Cu (II)) adsorption. It was demonstrated that upon amalgamation of PAM, the adsorption capacity of Cu (II) was enhanced from 2 and 2.3 times when compared to AG beads and PVAG beads, respectively. The resulted beads were chemically and mechanically stable with complexation (contributed by NH2 groups) and cation-ion exchange (due to OH and COOH groups) were reported to be the dominant adsorption mechanisms (Zhang et al., 2018c). In a similar study, Chen et al. used Cu imprinted PVAG hydrogel for Cu (II) ions removal with an efficiency of 79.3 mg/g under optimal conditions. The impact of change in ionic strength on the uptake of Cu (II) ions was also demonstrated along with competitive adsorption studies using binary system of Cu (II)/Zn (II) and Cu (II)/Cd (II) respectively to evaluate the specificity of the designed system for Cu (II) ions (J. H. Chen, Lin, Luo, He, & Li, 2011). Moreover, Yi et al. reported the fabrication of PVAG/graphene oxide (GO) hydrogel microspheres for removal of Cu (II) and Uranium (U (VI)) ions from aqueous solution (Yi et al., 2018). The study emphasized on the dependency of the efficiency of the removal of Cu (II) and U (VI) ions on pH, initial ion concentration and presence of competing ions. The method could have significant impact in the removal process of Cu (II) and U (VI) ions from wastewater. However, studying the efficiency of this process in the presence of competing ions could be vital and will aid in the refinement of the process. In order to remove arsenic (As) from water, Ollier and coworkers designed an ecofriendly PVAG (50/50) hydrogel beads comprising of natural bentonite clay (30 wt %) via ionic gelation. In this study, the incorporation of clay in the hydrogels served as an imperative factor in successful removal of arsenic where PVAG hydrogel beads alone were incapable to eliminate As from polluted water (Baigorria, Cano, Sanchez, Alvarez, & Ollier, 2020). Moreover, Jang et al. proposed a PVAG encapsulated prussian blue graphene oxide (PB-GO) hydrogel beads for separating cesium (Cs) from aq. solution with the help of a continuous fixed-bed column (Jang & Lee, 2016). The study was performed while considering different parameters (Cs concentration, pH, bed height, flow rate, and size of the bead) that could aid in improvement of the efficiency of the designed system. Moreover, chromium (Cr) metal is associated with carcinogenic and mutagenic properties and poses a serious threat as a potent water pollutant owing to its high aqueous solubility and oxidizing nature. In large quantities, trivalent (Cr (III)) and hexavalent (Cr (VI) chromium ions) have been linked to many adverse effects (Baruthio, 1992). Considering this, Chen et al. prepared a Cr (III) ion imprinted PVAG membrane with polyethylene glycol (PEG), used as porogen, and glutaraldehyde as the cross-linking agent. The membrane presented the key feature of its ability to be used without centrifugation and filtration. To demonstrate the specificity towards Cr (III) ions, competitive adsorption studies of the binary system of Cr (III)/Cu (II), Cr (III)/Cd (II) and the ternary system of Cr (III)/Cu (II)/Cd (II) were also investigated (J. H. (Chen et al., 2010)). Further in this regard, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MCNTs) was incorporated into the PVAG matrix and immobilized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain to remove the toxic Cr (VI) ions by Pang et al. Immobilization of the bacterial strain on the PVAG matrix enhanced the bacterial tolerance towards Cr with repeated usability. The study inculcated the potential of microbial immobilization technology in remediation of Cr (VI) from contained water (Pang et al., 2011). The importance of PVAG matrix as a platform for the immobilization of different moieties is being continuously explored for various applications. To further improve the features of PVAG matrix, Zain et al. introduced sodium sulfate during the preparation of PVAG matrix (Zain, Suhaimi, & Idris, 2011). Constant efforts are being made with latest technological improvements in order to amend the characteristic features of PVAG matrix which includes enzyme immobilization, introduction of peptide sequences, changes in ionic strength etc. It is imperative to add that the pH dependency of the PVAG matrix could be a key aspect to be explored for further improvements. The PVAG hydrogels have also found its application in multiple adsorption-desorption cycles for dyes. A core-shell structured hydrogels with a macro porous core of flexible interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) and a micro porous shell of rigid semi-IPN were prepared by Yue et al. via chemical crosslinking of PVA and AG with Ca2+ ions and glutaraldehyde (Yue et al., 2016). The hydrogels were further reinforced with cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) which enhanced the adsorption capacity of methyl blue by 10%. Incorporation of CNFs in the PVAG hydrogel imparted enhanced density, viscoelasticity, and mechanical strength, which could be used for numerous additional industrial based applications (Fig. 5 ). However, Bano et al. utilized this strategy for chlorine (Cl) stability by designing a composite nanofiltration unit using PVAG matrix on polysulfone support. The membrane exhibited decent Cl stability upon exposure to a 300 ppm sodium hypochlorite solution. Further, alterations in the process could refine the membrane for more efficiency and can have widespread commercial applicability. (Bano, Mahmood, Kim, & Lee, 2014). On similar grounds, another study was carried out by Zhou et al. in which PVAG/lanthanum hydroxide (PVAG-LH) hydrogel beads with an IPN structure were synthesized for phosphorous removal (Zhou et al., 2018). However, the system lacks reusability as after five runs; the system could attain only 75% efficiency as compared to the first run. Improvisation in the bead structure with optimum concentration and incorporation of another ion could provide better reusability of the designed hydrogel beads with enhanced efficiency. The use of PVAG matrix was further explored by Cheng et al. for the degradation of crystal violet (CV) from aqueous solution. The study included the immobilization of Burkholderia vietnamiensis C09V strain on PVAG-kaolin gel beads (PVAGK) which could achieve almost 99% of CV degradation when compared to PVAGK alone (94%) (Cheng, Lin, Chen, Megharaj, & Naidu, 2012). The potential of PVAGK was further investigated by Lin et al. through immobilizing Bacillus mycoides, a 2, 4, 6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) degrading bacteria, on the PVAGK beads. The efficiency of TNT removal was reported to be increased from 20.6% to 92.63% upon immobilization of the bacterial strain on the beads with reusability (Lin, Chen, Megharaj, & Naidu, 2013). Similar strategy was also explored by Ruan et al. who carried out his work on similar platform to design a system for biodegradation of phenol by immobilizing Sphingomonas sp. GY2B, on PVAGK beads (Ruan et al., 2018). This study demonstrated the ability of PVAGK beads to further enhance the degradation rate of phenol efficiently by immobilized cells (16.79 ± 0.81 mg/(L·h)) as compared to free cells (11.49 ± 1.29 mg/(L·h)). The beads offered the advantage of reusability of the system upto 16 times while removing 99.5% phenol and upon storage at 4 °C for 90 days, removal of 99% phenol was still achievable. Moreover, in order to remove methylene blue (MB) from water, Wang et al. designed hydrogel beads of PVAG-chitosan-montmorillonite nanosheets (MMTNS) (W. (Wang et al., 2018)). The beads were validated to possess superior affinity towards MB at higher pH values owing to the stronger electronegativity triggered by deprotonation of hydroxyl groups. The beads also offered the advantage of stability and reusability with widespread applications in textile, dye and pharmaceutical industries. Technological advancement and industrialization has posed serious threat to the environment and aquatic ecosystem. In this regard, Bhatti et al. studied the adsorption-desorption behavior of dyes like Direct Orange-26 (DO-26), Direct Red-31 (DR-31), Direct Blue-67 (DB-67) and Ever direct Orange-3GL (EDO-3) on different substrates and matrix (modified rice husk (MRH) and PVAG, and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) immobilized biomasses (Bhatti et al., 2020). The study could find its usefulness in removing dyes from textile industries, which is a key contributor in the contamination of water with dyes. To further elevate the efficiency of these hydrogels, Wang et al. proposed a shape stable PVAG hydrogels crosslinked with borate ions. The hydrogels were able to retain the shape under repeated dry-rewet conditions. Further refinement in the designed system was done by crosslinking the hydrogels with sulfate ions but the strategy could offer negligible upgradation in the stability of the system (Wang, Chnag, & Lee, 2019). On similar grounds, Tsai et al. proposed the immobilization of prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles on PVA granules to synthesize shape stable membranes by crosslinking it with AG using borate ions (Tsai, Chang, Chen, Lo, & Lee, 2019). The designed matrix demonstrated an effectual diffusivity for Cs ions under different conditions and commendable efficiency in removing PB fragments. This system offered the advantage of long term storing period and applicability in either wet or dry conditions. Further, Shi and coworkers proposed the technique of immobilizing microorganisms on PVAG matrix for removing high-strength ammonium (NH4 +-N) from wastewater (X. Xu, Jin, et al., 2017). The effect of surface area and pore size on the removal process was deeply investigated with emphasis on the composition of microorganism’s community in the inner and outer section of the beads. Constant improvisation in PVAG matrix in terms of stability, efficiency and applicability will widen the horizon of this matrix in diverse applications. Pervaporation is a membrane-based separation method with its utility in separating organic mixtures, dehydration of a mixture of organic-aqueous phase, and removal of volatile organic traces from water (Feng & Huang, 1997). Easy design process, cost effectiveness, environmental friendly, and low energy consumption are some of the advantages associated with the pervaporation techniques (Peng, Lan, Liang, & Jia, 2021). In terms of contaminates present in industrial effluents, dimethylformamide (DMF) is one such organic solvent which have adverse health and environmental effects. In this regard, Kahya et al. explored the process of pervaporation to separate DMF from water using PVAG membranes. The method was investigated to comprehend the effect of PVA and AG ratio, membrane thickness, working temperature, and initial concentration of ions on permeability and separation rate (Kahya, Solak, & Şanlı, 2010). Further, Kumar et al. fabricated Ochrobactrum sp. DGVK1 cells entrapped in PVAG mixed matrix for removal of DMF from aqueous solution (Kumar, Kumar, Siddavattam, & Karegoudar, 2012b). However, Xing and coworkers reported a dual-function catalytic composite membrane (CCM) by coating sulfonated polyvinyl alcohol (SPVA) casting solution onto PVAG membrane to study the dehydration of ethanol under the influence of pervaporation process (Bo et al., 2018). The reported strategy examined a comparative study for the conversion of acetic acid in different reactors indicating outstanding catalytic performance of CCM along with the stability of CCM in acidic environment. Another industrial effluent, 1-4 dioxane (DX) has been placed under the category of contaminants and is also associated with cancer. DX is used in many industrial applications like filtration, degassing of metals and is highly soluble in water even at higher concentrations (C.-S. (Lee et al., 2021)). In order to remove DX from water, Kuila et al. prepared several blends of PVA and AG to test their applicability for pervaporative separation of DX from wastewater. To further impart selectivity and enhance the efficiency, the PVAG matrix was reinforced with nanosized sodium montmorillonite fillers to act as filters for separating DX from water (Kuila & Ray, 2014). The method of pervaporation can be combined with the main reaction steps involved in the removal process which could result in substantial advancements in the removal efficiency and process economics. A lot of scope exists in further utilizing the separated byproducts for commercial use. Research is underway to develop innovative membranes with high selectivity to expand the fled of removing contaminants from wastewater. Not only chemical effluents spoils the water but even nutrients are also placed in the category of contaminates. Nutrients like nitrogen are very essential for plant and animal growth, but excess of nitrogen from water bodies has to be removed as it may contaminate the aquatic system through eutrophication (Smith, Tilman, & Nekola, 1999). Nitrogen enrichment results in overgrowth of algae, which would result in water clogging. This may result in depletion of oxygen for aquatic ecosystem and could restrict sunlight to reach the bottom of water bodies, which is also an important requirement for any living organism. The conventional process of removing biological nitrogen has been replaced by anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX), an innovative process to remove biological nitrogen. Under anoxic conditions, ANAMMOX bacteria converts ammonium to nitrogen gas operating with nitrite as a terminal electron acceptor (X. (Ma & Wang, 2018)). In this regard, Bae et al. proposed an alternative to the option of transferring anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) biomass from a region of its abundance to a region of its requirement using PVAG gel beads as an immobilization system (Bae et al., 2015). The study inoculated ANAMMOX bacteria (Brocadia sinica) on the gel beads in order to remove nitrogen with an efficiency of 88%. The efficiency could further be improved if the surface to volume ratio of the gel beads could be controlled. Further, Cho et al. did a comparative study to access the performance of ANAMMOX bacterial niche in two identical bioreactors comprising of PVAG gel beads inoculated with pre-cultured ANAMMOX bacteria (PAB) and activated sludge (AS) (Cho, Choi, Jeong, Lee, & Bae, 2017). These examples clearly indicate the capability of PVAG gel beads in entrapping and eliminating excessive nitrogen from water. Bae et al. further refined this process by introducing single-stage autotrophic nitrogen removal (SANR) system (Bae, Choi, Chung, Lee, & Yoo, 2017). In this study, a core-shell structure was designed of PVA and AG gel beads. In the outer section of the core-shell arrangement, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) was immobilized whereas, ANAMMOX bacteria was immobilized in the inner section. In the designed system, oxygen penetration depth and nitrifying biomass concentration was critically evaluated in order to shield ANAMMOX bacteria from aerobic environment. The system was accessed for continuous and batch modes with careful evaluation for the shell thickness, which would have significant impact against ANAMMOX bacteria protection. Moreover, Ali et al. successfully achieved rapid startup of ANAMMOX process in up-flow column reactors by immobilizing nominal biomass in PVAG gel beads (Ali et al., 2015). The study could offer vital information on starting an ANAMMOX process with minimal amount of biomass. As an alternative approach to culture ANAMMOX, Tuyen et al. crosslinked PVAG gel beads with sodium sulfate in order to improve mechanical strength, and swelling behavior of the beads. The synthesized gel beads were able to initiate ANAMMOX process with the nitrogen removal efficiency of 60% and nitrogen loading rate (NLR) achieved at 0.14 kg N/m3/d (Tuyen et al., 2018). The strategy is suitable for ANAMMOX immobilization and can be applied in the continuous stirred tank reactor. However, the strategy needs to be further investigated in terms of reactor configuration and initial ANAMMOX biomass requirement for efficient nitrogen removal performance. Accumulation of nitrate ions in the surface and ground water is a key contaminant and is associated with many pathological conditions such as increased heart rate, fatigue, skin diseases (Ahluwalia et al., 2016). Nitrate can convert hemoglobin into methhemoglobin, which exhibits many health issues (Ward et al., 2018). Removal of nitrate from water bodies has both, environmental and health impacts. In a study, Phuong et al. fabricated Mg-Al LDH-AG/PVA beads for nitrate removal (Phuong, 2014). The strategy showed promising results and could further be explored for upscaling. In addition, the accumulation of iodine ions from nuclear wastewater is also a major source of adulteration and leads to many diseases due to its toxic nature (Hou et al., 2009). In this regard, Majidnia et al. explored the possibility of using PVAG beads entrapped with different materials like maghemite (γ-Fe2O3, titania (TiO2) and, a combination of titania and maghemite in order to remove iodine in batch sorption under sunlight. The strategy offered reusability and negligible reduction in efficiency upon reuse (Majidnia & Idris, 2015). The process was further used to remove lead (Pb (II)) from water (Majidnia & Fulazzaky, 2016). This process offers a quick, reliable, and straightforward method to effectively remove metal contaminants from wastewater in the future. Apart from nutrient contamination, herbicides used in agriculture also presents serious threats and implications to the human health and environment. Efficient systems to degrade these herbicides have always been a challenge to the scientific community for which considerable steps are being taken. In this regard, Liu et al. immobilized Leucobacter sp. JW-1 cells in PVAG beads (PSLBs) and reported its utility in degrading prometryn, a well-known s-triazine herbicide. Optimum ration of native components for beads formation, concentration of cells, immobilization time, and crosslinker concentration were thoroughly studied to establish a set of conditions for maximum efficiency in degrading prometryn (Junwei (Liu et al., 2018)). The study also demonstrated the enhancement in the tolerance level of JW-1 cells in native state compare to immobilized state. Use of degradable biomaterials and reusability are key factors associated with system that could be further explored by incorporating protein/peptide-based substituents that are prone to degradation by enzymes. This will provide a proof-of-concept of the proposed strategy in order to study the same system on degrading other herbicides. Increasing demand of rare earth elements (REEs) have led to the innovation in the recovery process of REEs from wastewater. The recovery of REEs holds a promising environmental and economic importance owing to diverse applicability of REEs in industries along with high priced demand in market. In this regard, da Costa et al. utilized sericin and AG particles crosslinked with PVA for adsorption of ytterbium (Yb) (da Costa, da Silva, & Vieira, 2021). The study aimed with the development of an effective method for Yb3p desorption. In this study, nitric acid at an optimum concentration of 0.3mol/L showed highest efficiency in Yb3p adsorption. The study could be of high importance to selectively recover Yb3p from industrial effluents and other secondary sources. This system could further be modified for their application in recovering other RREs. In another study, Li et al. demonstrated the applicability of PVAG membranes for gas dehumidification and solvent dehydration. They studied both, flat sheet homogenous membrane and polysulfone based hollow composites for their efficiency in water/propylene selectivity. Enhancement in the dehumidification process for PVAG membrane compared to native forms were reported which could be accounted for the moderate swelling behavior, high water permeability, and promising free volume properties (Y. Li, Jia, Pan, Jiang, & Cheng, 2012). The study may present commercialization and scale up opportunities as water permeable membranes have diverse application in the industrial sector. To further implement innovative methods for treating wastewater for contaminates, the application of nanotechnology has also been explored. Nanotechnology is the science of studying the properties of bulk materials at the nano regime. With persistent progress, nanoparticles have been used in many applications. In this regard, Talebi et al. utilized electrospinning method for nanofiber formation to study PVAG/poly(ethylene oxide)/HZSM5 nanofibers for sorption of thorium (Th (IV) and uranium (U (VI)) ions from aqueous solution. The system was investigated for optimum parameters to have maximum efficiency (Talebi, Abbasizadeh, & Keshtkar, 2017). The study could further be developed by studying the binary system in details through analyzing the effect of concentration ration of the two focused ions. Polymer based nanocomposite hydrogels have been employed for diverse biomedical applications ((Caló & Khutoryanskiy, 2015); Y. (Zhang & Huang, 2021)) and have immense potential in designing nanofilteration units in terms of membranes. To explore this field, Amiri et al. designed a microporous polyethersulfone (PES)/PVA-graphene oxide-AG nanocomposite hydrogel blended membranes (Amiri, Asghari, Vatanpour, & Rajabi, 2020). The hydrogel was fabricated by in situ crosslinking using boric acid and calcium chloride curing solution. The matrix was reported to have enhanced permeability, improved antifouling properties along with enriched hydrophilic character. The application of the synthesized hydrogels was accessed on the removal of Lanasol Blue 3R dye. The nanofilteration membrane could be very vital in investigating the hydrophobic dyes based on the % blend of PVA incorporated in the final hydrogel. The application of Fe0-Fe3O4 based PVAG nanocomposite beads was investigated by Lv et al. for chromium ion Cr (VI) removal. The synthesized nanocomposite beads offered the advantage of being robust in nature, outstanding physical properties, high catalytic activity, and reusability (Lv et al., 2013). The study predicated the effect of concentration of Cr (VI) ions, pH, temperature, and mass fraction of Fe0-Fe3O4 on the final output efficiency. The work could offer a practical and highly effectual method to remove heavy metal from water along with capability to solve the complications in stability, separation and reusability through nanoparticles generation. This study also demonstrated the importance of physical properties of the beads as a key feature that could be manipulated for enhanced efficiency. In a similar study, Rahman et al. reported maghemite (Fe2O3) nanoparticles embedded in a matrix of PVAG to form beads for removing Hg (II) ions in aqueous solution with an efficiency of 96% in 4 hrs. Owing to the presence of magnetic nanoparticles, the beads could be recovered with the application of external magnetic field. This designed system offered independence from the concentration of photocatalyst, as lower photocatalyst dosage resulted in a lower efficiency in Hg (II) removal while higher dosage of photocatalyst had negligible improvement in the efficiency of the process (Rahman, Teo, Idris, Misran, & Leong, 2016). Removal of Hg (II) ions has both economic and environmental importance as Hg (II) ions are associated with many pathological conditions (Genchi, Sinicropi, Carocci, Lauria, & Catalano, 2017) and also finds its applications in many industrial usages (Sznopek & Goonan, 2000). In this regard, Idris et al. reported the use of maghemite (g-Fe2O3) nanoparticles containing photocatalyst beads in PVAG gels for reducing Cr (VI) to Cr (III) ions in water under sunlight (Idris, Misran, Hassan, Abd Jalil, & Seng, 2012). The superparamagnetic nature of the maghemite nanoparticles and the robust nature of PVA were explored to make the system stable and reusable for continuous seven times without washing. The study also explored the catalytic conversion rate of Cr (VI) to Cr (III) ions as a function of variation in concentration of magnetic nanoparticles and PVA. The porous nature of the fabricated gel could be associated with the high yielding efficiency in converting Cr(VI) to Cr(III) ions owing to the enhanced diffusion of Cr(VI) ions into the bead interiors. Further, Wong et al. synthesized cobalt (II)-doped iron oxide (Co-Fe2O3) nanoparticles coated with different surfactants like PEG, citrate, acetate and immobilized in PVA-SA matrix for Cu(II) ions removal from aqueous solution (Wong, Chan, & Idris, 2015). The work validated the effect of surfactant selection on the efficiency of Cu (II) ions removal with PEG being the most potent surfactant used in the study. It could be concluded that this recyclable adsorbent is a smart, appealing, and ecofriendly separation tool that could find its applicability in water purification systems for domestic usage. In another study, Lai et al. proposed a novel strategy to remove Cs from contaminated water using PB nanoparticles immobilized on PVAG matrix (Lai et al., 2016). The system addressed the shortcomings of using PB as a Cs absorbent as PB is known to release hexacyanoferrate fragments from the adsorbent matrix during the adsorption process. The system holds stability in seawater but with reduced efficiency. This gives further challenge to improve the working efficiency of the designed system in harsh (acidic and alkaline) conditions. The application of nanoparticles has also been explored in enhancing the catalytic activity of enzymes as reported by Mohammadi et al. in case of lipase enzyme. The work involved adsorption of lipase enzyme on silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) and entrapping in PVAG hydrogel (Mohammadi, Khiabani, Ghanbarzadeh, & Mokarram, 2020). The study highlighted the progress in the functioning of the lipase-SiO2 NPs entrapped gels when compared to the free and adsorbed enzyme in terms of results of the kinetic parameters. The study could further be investigated for operational stability and recovery of the biocatalysts which may provide further refinement to the process. The adverse health effects of contaminated food and water intake has been associated with a number of pathological conditions (Mamtani, Stern, Dawood, & Cheema, 2011). Nanoparticles based strategies have been devised to counter the inflation of microbes. In line to this, Abu-Saied et al. synthesized in situ silver nanoparticles in PVAG matrix and tested the potency of the system against bacteria and yeast using ten different antibiotics (Abu-Saied, Taha, El-Deeb, & Hafez, 2018). Further, in order to remove nitrogen from secondary effluent Xu et al. approached microbial entrapment method in PVAG gels reinforced with alumina nanoparticles. Batch experiments were undertaken with high ammonia removal efficiency ranging from 9.63 to 59.58 mg/L/hr (X. Xu, Lv, et al., 2017). Through these study, two bacterial communities, namely Alcaligenaceae and Comamonadaceae were identified that are capable of conducting both, heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification processes. The problem of degradability of PVAG matrix and instability to extreme pH conditions could be the focus of further innovation in the development of PVAG matrix. To address this concern, efforts are made to include photosensitive crosslinkers (polyethylene glycol-conjugated anthracene, amino acid monomers, Ca2+ cage (nitr-T) etc.) into the matrix. This will not only provide mechanical stability and structural constancy to PVAG matrix but will aid in enhanced degradability as well. A comprehensive table summarizing the application of PVAG matrix for wastewater treatment is described in Table 1"
14,Drug delivery,"4.2 Drug delivery Polymer networks and hydrogels have been extensively explored for drug delivery applications owing to their biocompatibility, versatility, and biodegradability (Harrison, 2007). Nowadays, a diverse list of polymers are being explored for numerous biomedical applications but natural polysaccharides find a unique place in the list due to their natural occurrence and room for functionalization (Lee & Mooney, 2012; Sood et al., 2021). Polymer combinations of natural and synthetic origin have been of interest to many researchers. In this regard, Anirudhan et al. explored the role of CMC/PVA/AG individual matrices for transdermal release of diltiazem (DTZ) (Anirudhan, Nair, & S, 2018). The work included the encapsulation of DTZ in PEG coated vinyl trimethoxysilane-g-chitosan polymer and this hydrophobic matrix was dispersed in AG, CMC, and PVA matrices. The PVA based matrices showed high efficiency in terms of sustained release of DTZ at in vivo levels. However, Esposito et al. explored the possibility of using PVAG based hydrogels for transdermal delivery of quercetin (Esposito et al., 2020). The ratio in which PVA and AG is utilized for hydrogel formation will have significant effect on the release behavior of the selected drug. Careful modulation in functionalization of these individual polymers could also be explored for increasing the stability and broadening the sensitivity of the designed hydrogels towards change in pH and temperature. Further, Anwar et al. proposed an IPN hydrogels of PVAG for studying the release of 2-Acylamido-2-methylpropane-sulfonic acid as monomer (AMPS) and tramadol HCl as model drugs. The studies were carried out at different pH conditions which was further investigated for improving the release kinetics and encapsulation efficiencies (Anwar, Ahmad, Minhas, & Rehmani, 2017). Similar kind of study was carried by Kulkarni et al. in which IPN hydrogels of PVAG were used to entrap and release prazosin hydrochloride, an anti-hypertensive drug (Kulkarni, Sreedhar, Mutalik, Setty, & Sa, 2010). The synthesized membranes offered flexibility, smooth texture, permeability to water and thin appearance. Moreover, Zhang et al. proposed an IPN network of PVAG hydrogels to compare the release behavior of macromolecular and macromolecular particles (Zhang et al., 2019). All these studies are focused on the sensitivity of the membrane towards change in pH and stability in specified microenvironment. The swelling behavior of the membranes will have direct relation with the release kinetics and incorporation of different nanoparticles (native and in combination) could be explored to further maneuver the drug release behavior. Combinations of PVA and AG networks with other polymers, with or without proteins, have also been studied to encapsulate nanoparticles as a strategy for innovative drug delivery systems. In this line, Prabha et al. synthesized doxorubicin loaded AG stabilized magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) coated with PVA and BSA. The strategy resulted in high encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 96% with enhanced drug being released in acidic medium compared to basic medium (Prabha & Raj, 2017). Further, to enhance the EE and swelling behavior, Hua et al. utilized freeze thawing cycle technique to synthesize PVAG hydrogel beads. Diclofenac sodium was used as the model drug to study the effect of swelling behavior and temperature on the drug release behavior of the beads (Hua, Ma, Li, Yang, & Wang, 2010). Similarly, Gupta et al. studied the diffusion kinetics of vitamin B12 from PVAG based gel scaffolds for targeted drug delivery (Gupta et al., 2020). However, Swamy et al. prepared PVAG microspheres by water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion method and crosslinked it via glutaraldehyde for controlled release application of metformin hydrochloride (MHC) as a model drug (Swamy et al., 2012). The drug release characteristics of a polymer matrix is effected by many parameters which includes the initial concentrations, amount of crosslinkers, time of crosslinking, temperature and pH. Monitoring and changing these parameters could result in devising a set of optimum conditions that are useful in designing the desired drug delivery strategy. For an effective drug delivery system, the release profile of the therapeutic factors from the matrix is an important factor. Although, therapeutic factors can be incorporated into the PVAG matrix, rapid diffusion from the water-swollen network of PVAG matrix presents challenges in drug entrapment. Reinforcement of the PVAG matrix with nanoparticles, peptide sequences and biomolecules could aid in the development of an improved, sustained releasing and mechanically robust matrix for efficient drug delivery system."
15,Tissue Engineering,"4.3 Tissue Engineering Human body is a complex system and constantly encounters wearing and tearing of tissues which becomes problematic after a certain time period and requires replacement. Tissue engineering is a fast maturing field that deals in this situation and has now become an important part of many biomedical applications. Polymers, both artificial and natural, have been playing a vital role in designing different tissue constructs. Combining polymer constructs with growth factors and signaling molecules under optimum conditions facilitates the proliferation and differentiation of cells at the target tissue and helps in its replacement and reconstruction (Jadbabaei, Kolahdoozan, Naeimi, & Ebadi-Dehaghani, 2021). In order to design an effective scaffold for tissue engineering, certain attributes are very important which includes the ability to cell adhesion, support for cell proliferation and differentiation, ability to impart cell infiltration and new tissue creation (Goonoo & Bhaw-Luximon, 2020). PVA and AG based matrix has shown potential in the field of tissue engineering as they fulfil most of the criteria’s required for developing a suitable construct. In this regard, the biocompatibility of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was tested on different compositions of electrospun PVAG nanofibers by Hernández, Álvarez-Pérez, Genesca, Gómez, & Covelo (2020). Moreover, porosity, mechanical property, and water absorption capacity of different combinations of PVAG scaffolds were studied by Luo, Luo, Gelinsky, Huang, and Ruan (2017) (Fig. 6(I)) and Seok et al. (2019) (Fig. 6(II)) as a function of initial concentrations of PVA and AG, in two different studies. These studies reflected the importance of PVAG blends for electrospinning and 3D bioprining based scaffold synthesis for tissue engineering applications. However, studies dedicated on the effect of porosity and pore size on the differentiation profile of the cells could further be helpful in innovative applications of PVA and AG in tissue engineering. 4.3.1 Soft tissue engineering Soft tissue engineering broadly encompasses tissues like fat, joint capsule, skin, muscles, nerves, blood vessels, fascia that facilitates the connecting of organs and tissues of a human body (Pei et al., 2017). Injury, pathological invasion, and ageing effect may lead to malfunction of the self-healing process of these soft tissues. To confront this challenge, George et al. developed an injectable system of vancomycin encapsulated polycaprolactone nanoparticles coated with Polyelectrolyte-Vitamin C embedded in a PVAG gel to tackle Staphylococcus aureus infections affecting skin tissues (George, Bavya, Rohan, & Srivastava, 2017) (Fig. 6(III)). The study presented an idea on deeply injecting biomaterials for cell proliferation and simultaneously using nanoparticles for delivery applications. Moreover, in order to reinstate the craniofacial cartilage, Bichara et al. developed a biosynthetic construct of PVAG hydrogels with human nasal septum chondrocytes (Bichara et al., 2010). The study not only demonstrated the deposition of collagen type II in the construct but also addressed the shortcomings (donor site morbidity and implant extrusion) of porous polyethylene, which has also been explored for restoring craniofacial cartilages. In the process of making PVA and AG based scaffolds for soft tissue engineering, the effect of different crosslinking materials on the mechanical, thermal, structural and cytocompability was investigated by Kumar et al. (2017). The effect of cross linkers in cellulose nanocrystals reinforced scaffold synthesis could affect cell adhesion on the scaffolds, cell proliferation and differentiation, which could be explored further for constructing scaffolds from diverse biomaterials. Further exploring the field of soft tissue engineering, Eivazzadeh-Keihan et al. developed magnesium hydroxide nanorods reinforced PVAG-silk fibroin scaffolds for targeting antibacterial applications (Eivazzadeh-Keihan et al., 2020). The study could have potential applications in pathological conditions associated with slow wound healing resulting in the exposure to bacterial infection. In the current scenario, a number of skin substitutes are being explored but fabricating a cost effective scaffold synthesis with adequate mechanical, biological and chemical properties still remains a challenge. In order to design an effective PVAG based construct for proficient tissue engineering applications, functionalization to impart mechanical strength, improved degradation rate, and cellular adhesion are key factors. Efforts are being made to incorporate peptide sequences, fillers or reinforcing agents and, nanoparticles in order to enhance the biomechanical properties of PVAG blends. Moreover, PVAG matrix can also be used for developing largest organ of our body, the skin. In order to construct a tissue-engineered skin the PVAG based constructs should be able to (a) offer an obstruction sheet of upper layer cells that form the barrier layer of the skin, (c) should be able to provide adequate vascularized, and (d) should provide elasticity and structural support for skin. The features can be fine-tuned in a PVAG based matrix through fabrication of different composites. In this regard, Sobhanian et al. proposed an electrospun PVAG/gelatin nanofibers based scaffold with adequate properties and cost effective fabrication process (Sobhanian, Khorram, Hashemi, & Mohammadi, 2019). Further, the scaffold was grafted with collagen to not only improve its biocompatibility but also decrease its tensile strength and Young's modulus with enhanced elongation at break. All these studies aimed to develop a suitable scaffold while addressing all the characteristic parameters that could be significant in soft tissue engineering applications. However, introduction of interconnecting pores in the designed scaffolds could be a key factor to further imitate tissue connectivity. Moreover, Thankam et al. prepared PVA and AG based semi and full IPN hydrogels to investigate the interconnectivity of the pores present in the designed scaffold for cardiac tissue engineering (Thankam, Muthu, Sankar, & Gopal, 2013). The full IPN hydrogels tend to have more applicability than the semi IPN hydrogels. While designing a construct for soft tissue engineering % hydrophobic behavior, presence of water in the pore gaps, tensile strength and modulus are some crucial features that could impact the biocompatibility, cellular growth, and migration which will have direct impact on the applicability of the designed scaffold. Further, PVAG based matrix could also be investigated for hollow tissue organs like those instituted in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems or gastrointestinal tract. To develop an applicable vascular scaffold, cell adhesion, permeability control, proliferation and formation of new vasculature are the prime requirements that a scaffold should support. Further, introduction of active sites for cell adhesion and proliferation in the PVAG matrix via tethering the backbone with individual molecules/agents or composites like pentadecafluorooctanoyl chloride (PFC), bioactive self-adhesion peptides, proteolytically degradable peptides presents a good strategy for an effective vascular scaffold designing. Efforts need to be made on evaluating the capacity of these molecules in enhancing the cellular adhesion and monitoring the cellular migration, functionality and growth in real time. 4.3.2 Hard tissue engineering The application of biomaterials for tissue engineering requires the designing of such a construct that inherits or stimulates the response of cells to external stimuli (pH, temperature, ionic strength etc) ((Mikos et al., 2006); K. Zhang et al., 2018). Hard tissues are also known as calcified tissues as they tend to have the deposition of calcium phosphate and include bone, tooth enamel, dentin and cementum (Khan & Tanaka, 2017). The use of PVAG for designing scaffolds for dental and orthopedic applications has been explored by many researchers with Chen et al. developed PVA reinforced AG/bioactive glass via electrophoretic deposition (Q. Chen, Cabanas-Polo, Goudouri, & Boccaccini, 2014). The work reflected the application of PVA concentration on the surface roughness, water contact angle, strength and microstructure of the designed scaffold. The work further needs to be examined for its biocompatibility and bio-functionalization in metallic implants. Moreover, to increase the in situ mineralization of hydroxyapatite, Abouzeid et al. used 3D bioprinting to construct PVAG-cellulose nanofibers through aqueous hydrogel (Abouzeid et al., 2020) (Fig. 6(IV)). In order to address the requirement of an appropriate scaffold for bone tissue engineering applications, the rheological behavior of the designed scaffold along with mechanical properties of unit filaments are very crucial. Bone scaffolds are materials placed in an area of bone loss with the function of aiding hard tissue repair or supplementing bone tissue volume to facilitate the placement of an implant (Kumar et al., 2017a, b, c). 4.3.3 Neural tissue engineering Neural tissue engineering (NTE) is an upcoming field with a great potential in addressing many neural diseases. A very few studies have been reported on the application of PVAG matrix on designing neural constructs which makes it a challenging field for further developments. The foremost requirement of a scaffold design in neural application is the exceptional toughness and applicability for electric conductance. In this regard, Golafshan et al. fabricated graphene sheets reinforced PVA/AG fibrous scaffold presenting concentration based interaction of graphene with the PVAG matrix (Golafshan, Kharaziha, & Fathi, 2017). The occurrence of non-covalent bonding between graphene sheets and PVAG matrix could have resulted in homogenous blend formation that affected the mechanical and electrical properties of the scaffold with enhanced cell proliferation and attachments (Fig. 7(I)). While selecting appropriate biomaterials for scaffold synthesis, stimulating neural cells for NTE, endorsing neural and non-neural cell differentiation and axonal growth could play a vital role. Continuing advances in PVAG matrix for NTE will enable the generation of effective therapies that are effective in treatment process many neural diseases and injuries."
16,Wound healing,"4.4 Wound healing In the management of burns, scars, accidental wounds and chronic ulcers, polymers have played a major role (G. Wu, Jin, Liu, & Zhang, 2020). The features of superabsorbent, chemical and mechanical resistance, hydrophilicity, and film forming ability of PVAG matrix have been employed in a variety of medical applications like liquefaction, leg ulcers, burns, and restoration of tissue functions in patients with limited movements (Kim, Park, Kim, Jin, Yong, Li, Choi, Woo, Yoo, & Lyoo, 2008). Managing chronic wounds is more challenging in ailments like diabetes in which wound healing is a rather slow process. In order to address this problem, Satish et al. developed a triiodothyronine encapsulated hydrogel comprising of PVAG/Gelatin with inherited property of absorbing exudates and maintain moist milieu across the wound (Satish, Aswathi, Maria, & Korrapati, 2019). In vivo application demonstrated the ability of the designed scaffold in promoting neovasculature development, skin cell proliferation and migration, interaction between cell and biomaterial and formation of lamellipodia (Fig. 7(II)). The hydrogel also exhibited the advantage of trivial T3 seepage in the circulatory system. The wound healing management should be permanent as reinfection across the skin wound is a common cause of impairment in wound healing process due to enhanced local temperature. To tackle this issue, Montaser et al. prepared a thermosensitive hydrogel of PVA blended with AG-g-N-isopropyl acrylamide encapsulating diclofenac sodium (DS) (Montaser, Rehan, & El-Naggar, 2019). In another study, cryogels of PVAG blends were prepared by Chhatri et al. using cryogenic method for wound healing applications (Chhatri et al., 2011). Similar studies were carried out by Kim et al. who synthesized nitrofurazone containing PVAG hydrogel matrix-based wound dressing systems (Kim et al., 2008a, b) and by Kamoun et al. by preparing PVAG matrix containing sodium ampicillin, a topical antibiotic (Kamoun, Kenawy, Tamer, El-Meligy, & Eldin, 2015). For an effective wound healing process to be accomplished advancement towards blood vessel development along with collagen deposition are vital features. The swelling ratio and the porosity of the designed scaffolds could be tailored via blending the centrations and this could affect the efficacy of the designed hydrogels. Open wounds are often susceptible to bacterial infection that further intensifies the medical treatment process of the ailment related with wounds/ulcers. To address this issue, in situ silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were synthesized via gamma irradiation in a film of PVAG by Eghbalifam et al. that could be used for wound healing applications with antimicrobial properties (Eghbalifam, Frounchi, & Dadbin, 2015). The composite film exhibited strong antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli even at very low level of Ag NPs. In another study, Chen et al. proposed in situ Ag NPs loaded PVAG/carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel for antibacterial wound dressing (Chen et al., 2020). Moreover, to impart long-term bactericidal effect and improved hemostasis capacity, Lei et al. designed a multi-functional PVAAG-dopamine hydrogel matrix-based wound dressing embedded with bis-quaternary triphenyl-phosphonium salt (BTPP+) (Lei et al., 2021). Further, the problem for antibiotic-resistant pathogens that may affect burn wounds was addressed by Kaur et al. via delivering bacteriophages and minocycline antibiotic through PVAG cross-linked hydrogels encapsulating (Kaur, Gondil, & Chhibber, 2019). The in-vivo evaluation of the developed PVAG hydrogel in Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) reveled controlled drug resistant bacterial infection as well as enhancing wound healing. On the similar grounds, Li et al. fabricated PVAG/organic rectorite (OREC) composite electrospun nanofibrous mats (W. (Li et al., 2013)). The mechanical strength and 3D arrangement of the mats was adequate of wound dressing with the added advantage of the ability of mats in imparting bacterial inhibition against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, the wound healing application of tragacanth gum and AG blends crosslinked in the presence of PVA was explored by Singh, Varshney, & Francis (2017). The hydrogel could be explored for controlled and sustained release of therapeutic molecules. Binary blends of PVAG based IPN films were studied by Miura, Kimura, Suzuki, Miyashita, & Nishio (1999) with emphasis on the thermal and viscoelastic properties of the blends. High flexibility and mechanical strength along with adequate porosity are prerequisites in the selection of materials for making wound dressings. In a study by Liu and coworkers, a nanocomposite sponges of PVAG/graphene oxide (GO) were synthesized by following the cryogenic method (Ma et al., 2019). The presence of GO in the sponges imparted enhanced cell proliferation features along with chemical stability and mechanical strength. The study could further be examined for the effect of different fillers like CNTs, nanocarbon, ceramic fillers in the sponge formation. In another study, papin encapsulated blends of PVA and AG were prepared to accelerate the wound healing process via chemical debridement of the skin (Dutra et al., 2017). In this study, the stability of the enzyme at different microenvironments and conditions was vital to comprehend the efficiency of the synthesized wound dressing film. All these studies are aimed to address the shortcoming of traditional wound healing management that includes adherence to the wounds, poor barrier effects, and poor haemostasis. Good mechanical property of a hydrogel supplemented with antibacterial features gives a synergistic effect in keeping the wound moist, delivering therapeutics/antibiotics along with protecting the wound against bacterial infection. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a biocompatible, nontoxic material and has been used in a variety of biomedical applications ((Egerton, 1991); Fei Yin, Wu, Gui Yang, & Hua Su, 2013). In this regard, Niranjan et al. tagged curcumin to TiO2 NPs and incorporated into PVAG patch (Niranjan et al., 2019).The physicochemical and mechanical properties of the patch pointed towards an ideal biomaterial for wound healing applications. Similarly, Shalumon et al. fabricated ZnO NPs incorporated PVAG electrospun nanofibrous mats (Shalumon et al., 2011). Both these studies emphasized on the effect of nanoparticles concentration on the biological and mechanical properties of the mats. Further, Adoor et al. introduced glycerol in PVAG blend to form organohydrogels in order to impart extreme temperature tolerance and thermoplasticity (Adoor, Prathab, Manjeshwar, & Aminabhavi, 2007). Apart from toughness and transparency, high ionic conductivity, and fast re-gelling were other features associated to these organohydrogels. Moreover, to impart magnetic behavior to the PVAG matrix, Nishio et al. synthesized IPN type of PVAG hydrogels with in situ synthesis of iron oxide (Nishio et al., 2004) whereas, Xu et al. fabricated magnetic gels using two set of PVAG and PVA-chitosan crosslinked by FeCl3 and glutaraldehyde (C.-X. Xu, Chen, Zheng, Chen, & Chen, 2008), respectively. In another study, Ma et al. prepared AG-g-PVA cross-linked with Fe(II) ion in a surfactant free emulsion system to form microparticles (Ma, Xiao, Li, Shi, & Zhu, 2008) whereas Mahdavinia et al. developed magnetic hydrogels of PVA and AG via double crosslinking using divalent Ca(II) ions and incorporating magnetic laponite nanoparticles (Mahdavinia, Mousanezhad, Hosseinzadeh, Darvishi, & Sabzi, 2016). The magnetic gels could be useful to track the real time monitoring of the healing process. The magnetic behavior of the gels is a vital feature that could be explored for imaging applications that in turn could be modulated by changing the initial ions and polymers concentration, measurement temperature. Further studying the ion exchange capacity and ion transportation in these gels could provide significant information that needs to be studied for technological advancements. Hollow-fiber ultrafiltration membranes have also been explored for wound healing applications by Dong et al. who reported the fabrication of hollow-fiber composite membrane, of PVAG blends (Dong, Zhang, Shen, Song, & Chen, 2006) supported by polysulfone. Moreover, Sanli et al. explored the blends of acrylamide (AAm) grafted onto PVAG beads crosslinked with GA for wound healing applications (Sanli, Ay, & Işiklan, 2007). These studied elucidated the effect of pH of the microenvironment in which the drugs are to be released from the patch along with the swelling ratios, which is very important in designing wound dressings. Table 2 represents a comprehensive summary of PVAG based matrix for various biomedical applications."
17,Foods and food packaging,"4.5 Foods and food packaging Advancement in the field of science and technology is accompanied with many environmental issues affecting our society. This has led to an increasing demand of biodegradable materials for food packaging. Also, evolution of microorganism is also a matter of concern owing to their growth in extreme conditions, which has led to mounting exigency of antimicrobial food packaging materials. Researchers have taken the advantage of PVAG blends in order to meet the demands and requirements of the food packaging industry. Taking advantage of the antibacterial property of Ag NPs, Narayanan et al. synthesized nanocomposites of PVA and AG at different ratios with Ag NPs as nanofillers (Narayanan & Han, 2017) whereas, Yang et al. fabricated a nanocomposite film of PVA and AG encapsulating melanin nanoparticles (Yang, Li, Yu, Liu, & Shi, 2020). Aroma in the food is considered a vital characteristic, which is sensitive to the processing, handling, and packaging methods and could directly be associated to the food quality and stability. In this regard, Levi et al. prepared a PVA-Ca AG cryogels encapsulation d-limonene (Levi et al., 2011). A perfect food packaging material should have high strength and toughness, should be able to withstand UV-visible rays, capability to resist change in environmental conditions and should impart thermal insulation to the food. The studies have implicated the importance of PVAG blends in the development of food packaging material. In terms of commercialization of PVAG based films and composites, the toxicological evaluation should play a key role."
18,Flame-retardant materials,"4.6 Flame-retardant materials The use of PVAG composites have also been investigated for fire retardant properties. In this regard, Wu et al. developed a highly efficient composite aerogel of PVA, AG and montmorillonite (MMT) using two step crosslinking with borate and calcium ions (Wu, Niu, Lang, & Xia, 2019). The developed aerogel presented outstanding smoke suppression ability and significant fire hazardous safety upon investigation. The study also implicated combination of the gaseous phase and condensed phase as the mechanism behind the flame retardancy ability of the designed aerogels. The designed material holds promising future implications in flame retardant foams owing to its high efficiency and biodegradability. Further, Yu et al. fabricated a fire-preventing triple-network (TN) hydrogel composed of composed of PNIPAAm/PVAG and laminated on cotton fabric to improve fire-resistant performance of cellulose fabrics. The designed hydrogel exhibited considerable swelling ratio, swelling-deswelling performance and antibacterial activity (Yu, Liu, He, Ma, & Yao, 2021). The work could be highlighted as a novel concept in the development of fire-resistant polymer fabric for fabricating fire-protective clothing. PVAG holds a promising future in the development of fire-retardant materials, which may have usage in life saving applications."
19,Agriculture,"4.7 Agriculture An important aspect for selecting a material in terms of applications is its environment friendly nature. Khoerunnisa et al. utilized the synergistic effect of PVAG matrix in controlled release of nutrients as an alternative strategy for controlled fertilizer release in agricultural field (Khoerunnisa, Sonjaya, & Chotimah, 2016). A PVAG matrix was crosslinked using glutaraldehyde to form hydrogels which was physiochemical evaluated. The study showed the enhancement in mechanical strength of the hydrogel up on incorporation of nutrients. The work could have high impact in executing sustained release of fertilizer materials and nutrients. The use of PVAG matrix for agricultural benefits is a new field with great potential that could be explored in future."
20,Fuel cells and batteries,"4.8 Fuel cells and batteries The application of PVA and AG has also been explored in the field of fuel cells by Yang et al. who prepared membranes of PVA and AG with and without crosslinking agent (J.-M. Yang, Wang, & Chiu, 2014). Both the membranes were investigated for thermal property, KOH uptakes, ionic conductivity, and methanol permeability. With similar target, Imaan et al. synthesized an electrolytic polymeric membrane of PVAG matrix impregnated with zinc oxide NPs (Imaan, Mir, & Ahmad, 2021). The emphasize was to demonstrate a cost effective proton exchange method. The attained features of both these membranes could make it a potential candidate for future alkaline direct fuel cells applications. Moreover, Jiang et al. obtained these PVAG hydrogels using freeze-thawing process and further increased its strength and conductivity using NaCl solution (Jiang et al., 2018). The hydrogels were tested for thermal and electrical conductance. It was also demonstrated that the time taken to immerse the hydrogel in NaCl solution had direct impact on the electric conductivity of the hydrogels. The study could provide insight into the use of PVAG based hydrogels as a potent hydrogel electrolyte. PVAG based matrix holds promising future in fuel cells and batteries with room for impressive application oriented outcomes."
21,Miscellaneous applications,"4.9 Miscellaneous applications Polymeric materials have found its application in almost every field with significant contribution in biomedical applications (Huang, Tsai, Lin, & Hsu, 2019). Various reports have been published on the use of gold nanorods (GNRs) for its biomedical applications (Centi, Ratto, Tatini, Lai, & Pini, 2018; (Ma et al., 2013); Scaletti, Kim, Messori, & Rotello, 2014). The synthesis of GNRs is associated with CTAB, which imparts toxicity to the materials. To tackle this problem, Almada et al. used thiolated chitosan/PVAG in order to synthesize GNRs (Almada et al., 2017). Further, Wang et al. proposed a dual crosslinked blend of AG and polyvinyl formal (PVF) reinforced with PVA to form IPN structured gels with superior cell attachment and biocompatibility and negligible cytotoxicity (Wang et al., 2017). The designed composite could have broad application prospects and could be used as a promising candidate for making medical sponges, tissue engineering and wound healing. Moreover, Kuo et al. utilized PVA, AG, gelatin conjugated with methacrylic anhydride (MA) and photo-crosslinked to prepare hydrogel scaffolds. This scaffold was further grafted with activin A and bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) to induce iPSCs to definitive endoderm (DE) lineage (Kuo et al., 2019). The system was then loaded with retinoic acid encapsulated solid lipid nanoparticles. The fabricated gels showed great potential in imitating pancreas along with sustaining the functions of pancreatic islets. In another study, Kauser et al. studied the reinforcement of AG functionalized halloysite clay nanotubes (HNT) on the thermo-mechanical properties PVA nanocomposites (Kouser et al., 2021). Apart from enhanced thermal and mechanical behavior, the reinforced nanocomposites also showed significant augmentation in the enzymatic degradation, cell proliferation, cell adhesion when compared to primeval PVA films. These studies have shed lights on the applications of PVAG based matrix in various fields. The matrix could be tailored for improved mechanical, thermal, electrical and biological behavior. PVA and AG based matrix is an ideal platform for a number of applications. Continued usage and research in the binary system of PVA and AG could introduce this system in less touched fields like aeronautics, nuclear science and aviation sector. Table 3 represents a detailed comprehensive summary of PVAG based matrix for various applications including food packaging, photo catalysis, flame retardation and fuel cells."
22,Conclusions and future perspectives,"Polymers have substantiated its attraction in almost every field of science owing to its distinctive properties and possibility for functionalization. As the polymer composite of PVA and AG continues to burgeon, a greater understanding and applicability of PVAG blends. A PVAG blend continues to improve the global health and benefits the industrial sector. The incredible advances of PVAG blends are truly a testament to the implausible properties of PVAG blends that includes its gel forming ability, biodegradability, biocompatibility, negligible toxicity, biodegradability, slow degradation ability and copious obtainability. Breakthrough advances in PVAG blends can stimulate growth and development in the modern era industry to appreciate sustainability and towering returns on investments, which impacts economical upfront. A major challenge in using PVAG blends is the weak mechanical strength, which needs to be improved for its usability in many biomedical applications. Additionally, AG, PVA, and PVAG matrix do not have active cell binding sites which restricts its biological activity. The structural, biological and functional properties of PVAG matrices could be improved by incorporating a variety of moieties including proteins, polymers metals, and nanoparticles. Doping of PVAG matrix with external molecules is a challenging task as alginate tends to degrade at high alkaline/acidic environment, presents poor chemical selectivity for backbone modifications, and are susceptible to high temperature. Also, since cells do not secrete the necessary homologous enzymes for degrading high density of covalent crosslinking in PVAG matrices, this sometimes restricts the usage of PVAG gels for wider biomedical applications. In order to overcome this shortcoming, peptide crosslinkers could be very useful as they can be cleaved by specific cells. Another approach to overcome this problem of degradation could be the reduction of crosslinking density. Usage of biomolecules and pharmaceutical active agents with free amine group that could be easily occupy the carboxylic group on the G blocks, thereby reducing the crosslinking density. Collaboration and multidisciplinary approach of different researchers with diverse background can advance towards the success of PVAG matrices in many unexplored fields like aircraft industry, nuclear science and space exploration. The dearth of data and knowledge on the behavior of PVAG blends in these unexplored fields should be addressed."
