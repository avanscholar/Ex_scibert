0,Introduction,"The serious issues of the time i.e. energy and environment are faced by all the developed and developing countries across the world. An increase in the population and improvement in the living standards of the people worldwide leads to higher energy consumption which has increased the global energy demand. On the other hand, depletion in conventional sources like fossil fuels and other non-renewable resources can cause major energy crises in the coming future. These resources also create pollution and lead to various climatic and ecological destruction to the environment which gives rise to an urgent need to switch to other renewable resources. Hydrogen provides an attractive, sustainable, environmentally friendly green fuel with low-emission transportation and higher energy content (energy density value is 14 J Kg−1 °C−1) as compared to other clean energy sources. It is a promising energy source for fuel cells and also an important feedstock for the chemical industry. Moreover, the transition to a hydrogen economy can fundamentally swap the nature of market, political and social customs. But the hydrogen economy mainly relies upon the purity of hydrogen, for example, the success of fuel cell technology requires hydrogen purity of about 99.99% whereas, in the feedstock for hydro-cracking, about 60–70% purity is required [1–4]. In order to use hydrogen with good efficiency for combustion in green fuel and other applications like in semiconductor, fine chemical and optoelectronic industries, purity is an important parameter. Conventionally, hydrogen separation is done by well-established and matured techniques like cryogenic distillation and pressure swing adsorption (PSA). Although they provide high purity i.e. about 99.99% with PSA and about 95% with cryogenic distillation, but these techniques are highly energy-intensive and require lots of capital due to larger units and heavy set-up [5–7]. So several researchers and industrialists are doing significant efforts to develop new and efficient methods for gas separation. Recently, membrane technology has received considerable attention in the separation and purification market owing to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness and low energy consumption. It has made the separation units more compact, portable, and easily compatible with the environment. With the membrane technology, gas separation can now be done at ambient conditions of low pressure and room temperature which was comparatively typical earlier using the cryogenic distillation process due to the involvement of extreme temperature and pressure conditions. This membrane technology has the advantage to be used in combination with other technology for achieving high efficiency at a faster rate with an effective purity level [8–10]."
1,Membrane-based gas separation,"In view of the great potential and other advantages, membrane technology is the fastest growing technology as compared to the other conventional method. With almost 90% less energy consumption [4], the membrane system provides a significant opportunity with a wide range of applications [11,12], this lead some countries like the US and many European countries to establish their large scale gas permeators. In the current political agenda, various countries are providing their roadmaps for the advancement in hydrogen technology [7]. A notable event regarding this is that the government of Iceland has established a target to become a complete hydrogen economy country by 2030, thus with the expansion in hydrogen usage as an energy source in the near future, its production is expected to increase up to 300 million tons worldwide by 2030 [13,14]. However, the hydrogen-based society requires developing crucial technologies like- 1. Advanced technology for economical production and purification of hydrogen gas. 2. Efficient and practical technology for hydrogen storage. 3. Well-arranged H2 delivery and distribution systems worldwide. 4. Technology and devices for proper utilization of hydrogen as a fuel. For step one, various groups are working for the advancement of the membrane-based gas separation on a large scale, and they have synthesized a highly effective hydrogen-selective polymeric membrane that possesses heat and pressure resistance. Fig. 1 depicts the annual release of hydrogen gas separation using polymer-based membranes, demonstrating the growth and escalation in the field. The innovative technologies and development of advanced materials are aimed to achieve the realization of a hydrogen energy-based society. Thus, membrane technology provides a real solution for the challenges the world is facing in balancing development and sustainability [15]."
2,Gas separation mechanism,"2.1 Gas separation mechanism The motion of gas molecules through the membrane is an action of driving forces. These driving forces can be potential gradient, concentration gradient, pressure gradient or electrical gradient [16]. The chemical structure and physical properties of the membrane material influence the gas separation characteristics a lot [17]. In general, the mechanism involved in membrane-based gas separation are-(i) Knudsen diffusion, (ii) molecular sieving, and (iii) solution diffusion, as shown in Fig. 2 . Depending upon the membrane characteristics like membrane material, morphology and type of the gas to be separated, any one mechanism or combination can be used. Basically, Knudsen diffusion and molecular sieving methods are used for the porous membranes, the average pore radius for the membrane following the Knudsen diffusion process is 5–10 nm while for molecular sieving it is 5–20 A°. The Knudsen diffusion process follows the mechanism where the pore diameter is less than the mean free path of the gas molecule and the molecule permeates in proportion to its molecular velocity and inversely proportional to the square of its molecular weight while in molecular sieving the membrane pores are of the roughly same size as compared to the diameter of the gas molecule [18]. For dense membranes, the solution diffusion method is used in which gas transportation occurs by following certain steps. In the first step, the gas molecules get adsorbed onto the membrane surface from the feed side, whereas in step two the gas molecules get diffused through the membrane material in the bulk, and in the third step, the gas molecules get desorbed out of the membrane from the permeate side. In addition to these mechanisms, surface diffusion and facilitated transport are certain another type of mechanisms followed by the gas molecules. They provides a comparatively higher preference for some specifically adsorbed gas molecules like the facilitated transport mechanism involves the utilization of some carrier species which forms a labile complex with the permeant molecule [19,12]. This improves the quality of purification and enhances the membrane separation technology. Surface diffusion occurs at low temperature when the gas molecules get strongly adsorbed in the pores or along the pore walls of the membranes due to higher interaction between the gas molecule and the inner surface [18]. The favoured adsorption site allows the reactant gas molecules to diffuse thus increasing the permeation rate. The kinetic diameter of all the gases are different like for H2 it is 2.89 A°, 3.30 A° for CO2, 3.46 A° for O2, and 3.64 A° for N2 respectively. Based upon the difference in kinetic diameter of H2 gas as compared to other gas molecules, the molecular sieving mechanism is generally used for separating the H2 gas from the mixture of gases. Since the kinetic diameter of the H2 gas molecule differs with almost all the gases by around 0.40 A° thus the membranes with very fine pores are used from which only H2 molecules can pass and the transport of larger kinetic diameter molecules gets hindered [20,21]. Apart from having the smallest kinetic diameter, certain other factors provide preference for H2 molecules like activation energy, polymer surface interaction, diffusion rate, spherical-shaped molecule, etc. These factors allow H2 to undergo more absorption and diffusion through the membrane [22]."
3,Shortcomings with inorganic membranes for gas separation: Need of polymer membranes,"2.2 Shortcomings with inorganic membranes for gas separation: Need of polymer membranes Inorganic membranes like metallic membranes (dense phase) and ceramic membranes (porous and non-porous) provides advantages like the capability to operate at high temperature and high flux. Among the existing membrane technology for hydrogen separation, metallic (especially Palladium) and metallic alloy based membranes [23] with infinite selectivity towards H2 have garnered huge attention on the commercial basis but the extremely high fabrication cost and poor thermo mechanical stability of the selective film layer makes their implementation limited only for small scale applications like in electronics industry where a small quantity of hydrogen with ultrahigh purity is required [24]. The gas separation mechanism through the metallic membranes involves the permeation of hydrogen through its components like protons and electrons. H2 gets dissociate on the feed stream side and re-associates again at the product side. This mechanism provides typically very high selectivity as the dense structure completely prevents the passage of large atoms and molecules like CO, CO2, O2, N2, etc. [12]. Yolcular [25] in 2016 prepared Pd/TiO2 composite membranes by electro-less plating on TiO2 substrate and obtained permeance value of 1.6 × 10−7 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1 with H2/N2 selectivity value over 1000. Kian et. al. [26] in 2018 synthesized an 8 μm thick Pd-Au layer by deposition on asymmetric micro porous Al2O3 substrate and obtained infinite ideal selectivity for H2 as compared to He and Ar at 400 °C. But the lack of physical porosity in the dense membranes results in less flux as compared to other kinds of membranes. In addition to higher cost, the pure Pd based membranes were found to get contaminated easily due to the presence of sulphur which forms Pd4S over the membrane surface [27], carbon monoxide, steam and hydrocarbons suppress H2 permeation by forming Pd compounds with Si and C [28,29]. Other metals like Vanadium, Nickel, Niobium and Tantalum have higher permeability at low temperature but the problems like H2 embrittlement and creation of surface oxide layers affects the gas transport [30]. Various areas such as fuel cell technology, membrane reactor processes rely upon the development of membranes allowing high-temperature separation of hydrogen. Ernst et al. [31] in 2007 synthesized Ni/ceramic membranes having high thermal and mechanical stability. The membrane exhibited high H2 permeability, increasing with temperature and good H2/N2 selectivity of 28 at 600 °C with surface diffusion mechanism through the pores. Similarly, fully-dense composite ceramic membranes comprised of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ and Ce0.8Y0.2O2-δ perovskite materials demonstrated the highest hydrogen permeability reported till then at 900 °C but they suffered from performance degradation over time due to increased inter-granular contact resistance[32]. Nwgou et. al. [33] in 2016 prepared nanoporous silica ceramic membranes using macro-porous alumina support and obtained high flux but the poor hydrogen gas selectivity deteriorated the separation results. The ceramic membranes have greater stability than Pd at high temperature and extreme conditions but possess less selectivity hence do not represents an ideal choice for commercialization, also the brittle nature creates difficulty in the membrane sealing and assembling at a high working temperature [34]. The synthesis of metal-ceramic composites like Pd/ceramic membranes improved the selectivity but the difference in thermal expansion coefficient gave rise to mechanical failure [35]. The membranes composed of silica/alumina composites can show good permeability and H2/CO2 selectivity of 590 up to 600 °C [36,37] but suffered from the problem of hydrothermal instability i.e. the membrane structure get change with continuous hydrolysis and condensation of silica network when exposed to humid gas steam at elevated temperature, this causes a reduction in both permeability and selectivity [38]. Several microporous membranes with a pore size less than 2 nm prepared using solvent swollen polymers (like hypercrosslinked polystyrene) under extensive crosslinking [39] provides higher permeability with significant selectivity and good thermal & chemical stability [28]. These membranes include crystalline membranes like zeolite membranes, metal–organic framework, etc. and amorphous membranes like silica membranes, carbon membranes and other metal oxide membranes. Zeolite, with its unique properties like regular pore structure and robustness under harsh conditions, makes it a potentially good membrane material. It provides the advantage of high gas permeability and its adsorbing nature makes it an efficient candidate for hydrogen storage. But the trouble in scaling up the defect-free zeolite membranes including the manufacturing and maintenance difficulties makes their progress in gas separation technology slower than predicted. Furthermore, the higher aperture size of zeolite membranes than the kinetic diameter of the gas molecule resulted in low hydrogen selectivity as compared to CO2 and CO. Additionally, the low reproducibility and modification requirements for improved selectivity enhance the cost relatively higher making the practical usage more difficult. Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) materials tailored using different combinations of metal nodes and organic linkers provides high surface area, structural robustness and topology diversity with tunable pore size. The membranes can be easily produced from pre-developed facilities for zeolite membranes and provide dramatically higher gas separation performance due to specific adsorption affinities and facile activation. Furthermore, the crystallography confirms well-defined structures with permanent porosity. MOFs are advantageous over other traditional nanoporous materials in that their pore shape/size and interaction with gaseous molecules can be adjusted through the alteration in organic linkers and metal complexes. Thus the high degree of structure designability and functionality makes them a suitable candidate for membrane technology, as these pore characteristics play a key role in the gas separation performances. Furthermore, their affinity for gases can be tuned simply by changing the combinations of organic linkers and metal complexes [40]. Besides having good overall hydrogen separation performances due to the combination of above mentioned physical and chemical properties, these membranes suffered from low reproducibility and gas permeances in the range of 10−8–10−6 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1 i.e. very less than the industrial demand, this inhibits their usage in practical. Also, mostly MOF membranes have a polycrystalline structure with inter-crystalline defects, formation of macroscopic cracks that are detrimental to the gas selectivity [41]. Further, the poor interaction with substrates, low mechanical and thermal stability result in a limited number of reported works on gas separation applications [40]. Thus it requires a further technological breakthrough in their manufacturing process to make their commercialization feasible. Silica membranes are the type of amorphous microporous membranes used for hydrogen purification. These membranes provide the advantage of adjustable gas separation performance by controlling their pore structures. Also, they are less expansive and easy to fabricate as compared to the metallic membranes but possess poor selectivity. Further studies showed that these membranes show densification of the pores resulting in structural changes [42]. Some other types of membranes like metal oxide and carbon-based membranes are also used for hydrogen separation but they were also found to be suffered from low selectivity and permeability issues. Also, the brittle nature of carbon membranes makes their handling difficult. Need of polymer membranes The membrane-based gas separation provides advantages of light weight, compact size, and low energy consumption but the implementation of inorganic membranes for gas separation at an industrial scale has been hampered by a number of factors, including high fabrication cost, modest manufacturing reproducibility, low mechanical resistance and issues in scaling-up. Although these membranes are very promising for gas separation performance at the laboratory scale, but the difficulty in processing into large surface area modules due to their inherent fragile nature and cost expanses at large scale fabrication has led the researcher’s interest to shift towards polymer membranes [43]. The easily processable polymer membranes with good mechanical strength and low cost have been implemented for large scale industrial applications. Further engineering with these polymer membranes using various methods to prepare polymer nanocomposite mixed matrix membranes is also advantageous for gas separation. This kind of approach combines the superior gas separation properties of inorganic materials with the mechanical properties and economical processabilities of the polymers. Furthermore, the addition of both porous and non-porous fillers raises the operating parameters of the membranes and provides the opportunity to adjust the membrane characteristics such as free volume by altering the particle size, loading and distribution [44]. This review is mainly aimed to address the summary of polymer-based membranes for hydrogen separation, the recent progress and advancement in different polymer types and further modifications and engineering of the polymer membranes and materials to improve the membrane characteristics and separation performances all are discussed."
4,Polymer membranes for gas separation: A brief overview,"2.3 Polymer membranes for gas separation: A brief overview In 1970, the first successful membrane-based gas separation was introduced to separate hydrogen from ammonia purge gas using polymeric membrane [24]. But the progress and commercialization of membrane technology on large scale occurred during the 1980s with the development of synthetic polymeric membranes. The technical and economical superiority of the polymeric material due to their lower cost, low weight, less space requirement and high flexibility has immensely benefited the membrane separation technology [17]. The important factors deciding the membrane performance are solubility, diffusivity, permeability and selectivity. Solubility (S) gives the interaction between the gas molecules and the membrane material and hence decides the concentration of gas molecules present within the membrane. Diffusivity (D) is the kinetic parameter that describes the mobility of gas molecules within the membrane, thus it gives the movement of gas molecules inside the membrane. Permeability (P), represented in terms of barrer, is defined as the mass transfer occurring from the membrane per unit time per cross-pressure, mathematically, it can be given as the product of solubility and diffusivity i.e. P = S × D The efficiency of a membrane can be easily interpreted by calculating its permeability and selectivity. Membrane selectivity (α) is the ability of the membrane to separate between the two gases. For a binary gaseous mixture of gases A and B, the ideal selectivity can be defined as the ratio of the permeability of the two gases. α AB = P A / P B The ideal selectivity can also be expressed by factoring the permeability into its solubility and diffusivity components as- α AB = S A / S B × D A / D B where the term (SA/SB) corresponds to the solubility selectivity and the term (DA/DB) corresponds to the diffusivity selectivity [45]. In membranes the selectivity terms are decided to depend upon the type of the material used, polymer chain packing, the interaction between the penetrate and penetrant molecules, membrane pore size and pore distribution. The diffusivity selectivity term is dominated in the glassy polymers (like polyimide (PI), polysulfone (PSF), etc.) which depends upon the size and shape of the penetrant molecule, effective pore volume, pore size, pore distribution in the membrane and the average inter-segmental distance between the polymeric chain while the solubility selectivity term is used in the rubbery polymers (like polyvinylamine (PVAm),polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS), etc.) which is a function of the condensability and interaction between the penetrant and the polymer [46,42]. Thus the separation in the rubbery polymer is based on the concept of condensability while in the glassy materials the difference in kinetic diameter of the penetrant gas is emphasized [47]. The proper selection of the membrane by considering the above factors including the mechanical strength and durability during the operation must be balanced against the total cost for achieving good separation results [24]. Since the discovery, various researches have been performed to increase the gas separation performance of the polymer membrane materials and as a consequence of which both permeability and selectivity have improved. But the tradeoff relationship is still a major issue with these membranes. Robeson in 1990 discovered that the membranes having high permeability suffers from low selectivity and vice-versa. Based upon which, in 1991, he quantified a trade-off relationship [48] between gas permeability (Px) and gas selectivity (αxy = Px/Py) by plotting a curve between log Px and log αxy and further revised it in 2008 [49] for a number of polymers. This trade-off relationship can be easily seen to degrade the membrane performance. (See Table 1 .) For example, membranes prepared from polycarbonate/p-nitroaniline/zeolite 4A although possessed higher selectivity of 121.3 for H2/CH4 and 72.5 for H2/N2 separation but they showed lower permeability towards hydrogen (less than 10 barrer) [50]. Similarly, in the composite membranes prepared from microporous metal–organic framework Cu-4,4′ –bipyridine-hexafluorosilicate (Cu-BPY-HFS) and matrimid, the permeability got increased with increasing MOF from 17.5 barrer to 26.74 barrer up to 40 wt% loading but it was accompanied by a reduction in selectivity from 79.55 to 54.78 towards H2/N2 [51]. Keeping this “Robeson upper bound” in mind, researchers are trying to obtain next-generation membranes having good permeability with acceptable selectivity. The further advancement in the membrane materials like PIMs and their unprecedented performance made the reconsideration of upper bound curves mandated. Pinnau and coworkers again redefined the shifts in the upper bound accommodating the substantial performance enhancement using recent PIMs for different gas pairs including H2/N2 and H2/CH4 [52]."
5,Polymer membranes for hydrogen separation,"Although the solubility aspects for hydrogen are unfavourable due to its weaker affinity with the polymer materials [28] but the smaller molecular dynamics diameter results in a higher diffusion coefficient that contributes towards high selectivity [24]. Glassy polymers, among others, can be considered a promising material for the separation of small-sized H2 gas molecules. These polymeric membranes have high mechanical strength and excellent selectivity. Polymers such as polycarbonate (PC), polyimide (PI), polysulfone (PSF), polyethersulfone (PES), polybenzimidazole (PBI), and others are used; however, PI and PBI are the most commercially used. Based upon the material affinity, polymeric membranes can be either CO2 selective or H2 selective. With glassy structured materials having rigid matrix, the membranes are hydrogen-selective while the rubbery material membranes are CO2 selective or H2-rejective [28]. Since the higher critical temperature of CO2 makes its reactivity higher as compared to H2 [60] so hydrogen separation from a mixture of gases like CO, CH4, CO2, etc. can be effectively achieved by utilizing both types of polymeric membranes as the H2 selective membranes rely on maximizing the diffusivity benefits whereas, in H2-rejective membranes, the key factor is to increase the reverse selectivity with respect to hydrogen [28]. By using the CO2 selective membranes, the re-pressurizing process after H2 purification can be avoided which substantially saves time, energy and cost [21]. Designing such reverse selective membranes requires materials with high CO2 affinity like polar ether linkages, poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) and amine-based chemicals. Several attempts have been reported to separate CO2 from H2 with a good selectivity value of 10 (using PEO) by utilizing the dipole-quadruple interactions of polar ether oxygen with acidic CO2 [61] at low temperature but the low permeability value makes it inadequate for commercial applications. Further, the problem can be tackle by using some modifications in the membranes structures and materials like introducing the CO2-selective groups via some grafting, copolymerization methods. For instance, Lau et. al. [62] in 2011 used hybrid organic–inorganic polymer grafted membranes to obtain a high permeability value of 1990 barrer without compromising the selectivity. The reverse selectivity can also be enhanced by introducing more fixed and mobile charge carriers such as functional groups. These groups are covalently bonded to the polymer matrix in fixed carrier membranes, and can only vibrate in a confined region i.e. they cannot diffuse freely. Such reverse selective membranes can be particularly effective because they promote polar gas permeability like CO2 through facilitated transport mechanisms [63]. Even though the polymeric membranes can give higher permeability with low investment but such membranes are restricted by low operating temperature and less hydrogen selectivity. Thus the intrinsic performance from the conventional polymeric membranes is not sufficient to meet the industrial demands [64]. While discussing the importance of H2/CO2 separation from the economical and environmental viewpoint, Markel et. al. [65] in 2012 suggested that H2/CO2 selectivity value higher than 10 can reduce the cost of H2 production. Various strategies have been used to tune the membrane properties by controlling the sorption and diffusion characteristics of the membranes. These include- (i) surface treatment of the membranes, (ii) designing new polymers for efficient membranes, (ii) modifying the existing ones using polymer blending, (iii) addition of nanoparticles fillers and additives, (iv) surface modification like metal coating, (v) blending with carbon-based materials like CNTs, zeolites, GO/rGO to obtain composite membranes, etc. Any influence on the polymer matrix can affect the properties. Due to the high selectivity of filler dispersion and the mechanical properties of the polymers, the combination of polymers and inorganic nano-fillers characteristics produces synergistic effects in mixed matrix membranes. The nature of fillers plays an important role in the diffusion coefficient of the membranes as [66] - 1. Firstly, the impermeable particles can create obstacles for the gas molecules to pass, thereby reducing the diffusivity and increasing the tortuosity. 2. Secondly, they (mainly nanoparticle fillers) can provide fractional free volume to the polymer matrix thus enhances diffusivity. In general, the impermeable nanoparticles like oxides (SiO2, TiO2, MgO) increases the free volume by inducing a distortion in the chain alignment whereas permeable porous nanoparticles like zeolites, mesoporous silicas or activated carbons create additional gas transport channels along with distorting the polymer chain, thus boost the performance [67]. Patel et. al. [68] in 2018 incorporated SiO2 nanoparticles into the polycarbonate matrix and observed a drastic change in the inter molecular chain packing which increased the permeability to about 66%. The mixture composition of the polymeric solution has a significant impact on many thermodynamical properties such as miscibility/solubility and swelling equilibria. These properties are combined expressed in terms of polymer–solvent interaction parameter or Flory-Huggin’s (X) parameters. The parameter takes account of the dissimilarities of the molecular size of solute particles while adopting the entropy of mixing that governs the phase behaviour of polymer blends and block copolymer. This constitutes the miscibility criteria that provide grateful results in interpreting the experiments thus works for homogenous membrane fabrication. Besides that, it is quite evident that the dense membranes with low thickness show high permeability due to lesser time through the membrane and higher collision frequency between the pore walls [69]. So, to improve the separation performance, the polymer membrane should possess minimum thickness to get maximum permeance, also, it should have a uniform distribution of pores for high selectivity and good mechanical strength to avoid any rupture [70]. The surface coating of the selective layer on porous support can be a possible solution to the above. For example, Ali et. al. [71] in 2017 synthesized ultra-selective defect-free molecular sieving membranes by coating polyimide thin film on porous polysulfone support by using interfacial polymerization method. Further, the membranes demonstrated high performance with H2/CO2 selectivity of 50."
6,Conjugate polymer membranes for hydrogen separation,"3.1 Conjugate polymer membranes for hydrogen separation Conjugate polymers, as membrane material, combines the merits of both chemical and physical attributes of the material. The delocalized π-electrons present in their structure provides stiffness to the polymer chain to form a rigid membrane structure and further the produced membranes achieve high separation factors by promoting facilitated transport in union with the already known Fickian transport [72]. The gas transport through a membrane preponderantly relates to the combined action of kinetic diameter, diffusivity, solubility and critical temperature (TC) of the gas molecule [73,74], conjugate polymers allow controlling the molecular spacing of the polymer chains through doping and de-doping processes [75–77]. Thus, it provides a scope to modify the membranes and hence tune the gas separation properties even after the film formation. Different conjugate polymers like PANI, PPy and polythiophene and their copolymers including the ortho/meta- substituents can be used where depending upon the steric and electronic factors these derivatives possesses different solid-state crystallinity that can provide different reactivity and free volume to the membranes or coating [73,78]. Gupta et. al. [79] in 2006 prepared self-supported PANI films of thickness 2–6 μm and obtained high selectivity values of 348, 69.5, 8.6 towards H2/N2, H2/O2 and H2/CO2 respectively. They also prepared ultrathin PANI films on PVDF support to improve the mechanical strength of the membranes. Giel et. al. [80] in 2016 prepared MMM using PANI and polybenzimidazole (PBI) and observed an increment in the gas selectivity values with the addition of PANI due to the change in chemical structure and morphology, mainly reduction in d-spacing, but it also causes a decline in permeability. This reverse effect was minimized in a subsequent experiment where the PANI/PBI membranes were treated thermally up to 600 °C. The resultant membranes showed an improvement in separation qualities in terms of both hydrogen permeability and selectivity [81]. Despite having high separation factors and good chemical stability, the commercial applications of these PANI films are greatly affected due to lower permeability. A minimum thickness is required for better flux while lowering the thickness causes the membranes to lose strength, thus both factors need to be optimized. Chemical in-situ polymerization including electrochemical polymerization, copolymerization, can be a way to deal with the problem. Ghalei et. al [73] in 2017 coated PANI layer on high free volume glassy PIM-1 polymer using controllable surface polymerization method to obtain H2/N2 and H2/CO2 selectivity values of 158 and 6.5, respectively. Another member of the conjugate polymer family, polythiophene can produce a 3-dimensional rigid network with permanent and intrinsic open channels but the resulted films are generally frangible and contain cracks. Zhang et. al. [4] in 2019 synthesized polythiophene derivative-based membranes using the electro polymerization method combined with the softness adjustment to the rigid network (SAR) strategy. Using SAR strategy, these rigid units were combined with the flexible alkyl chains to ensure the flexibility and robustness of the membranes along with homogenous and crack-free morphology. The combination of poly (3,3′-bithiophene) and 3-butyl thiophene (P33DT-ThC4) was found to possess outstanding hydrogen permeability of 626 barrer and H2/CO2 selectivity up to 50 by using the molecular size discrimination as the effective mechanism. Further, the chemical, thermal and long term stability test showed the extraordinary durability of the membranes with robustness towards acidic and thermal conditions. The smaller kinetic diameter of H2 gas provides higher diffusivity through dense and rigid membrane structure of conjugate polymer membranes but the presence of a strong conjugated π system provides better solubility towards polar gases like CO2, results in lower selectivity for either H2 or CO2 [73]. Also, the dense chain-packing morphology of the conjugate polymers results in a comparatively lower value of permeability limiting the performance at the industrial level."
7,Membranes with polymer blending for hydrogen separation,"3.2 Membranes with polymer blending for hydrogen separation The strategy of polymer blending by mixing two different polymers can be used to combine the favourable aspects of different polymers. It is a time and cost-effective strategy to generate new membrane material with superior properties to the previous polymer precursors. Various studies vindicate the change in chain packing density, segmental mobility and d-spacing associated with blending, moreover, the properties lie in between that of the pure polymers [10]. For example, the glassy polymers like polycarbonate and polysulfone having the same ring structure in the repeating unit i.e. bisphenol-A can form miscible blends with some new bonds [56] while the incorporation of high-performance polymer PBI into matrimid polyimide polymer can enhance the membrane stiffness and decrease the polymer chain spacing without changing solubility selectivity, hence these approaches can greatly influence the separation parameters [10]. Sometimes, the formation of strong hydrogen bonds between the blends that were not present in the initial constituents can restrict the polymer chain’s free rotation and mobility, and diminish the fractional free volume which affects the diffusivity selectivity. By carefully considering the miscibility and interaction factors integrated membranes with several features like high mechanical strength, chemical stability and better gas separation properties can be obtained. Acharya et. al. [56] in 2008 prepared blends of PC and PSF using the solution casting method and observed an increase in the permeability of the blended membranes with increasing concentration of PC due to the change in free volume properties. Weng et. al. [57] in 2008 combined partially crystalline and thermostable properties of highly symmetrically structured poly(bisphenol-A-co-4-nitrophthalic anhydride-co-1,3-phenylene diamine) (PBNPI) with polyphenylsulfone (PPSU) to overcome the low permeability problem of PBNPI while maintaining the thermostability. Hosseini et. al. [10] in 2008 successfully demonstrated the improved gas separation through blending of matrimid and polybenzimidazole (PBI). The membranes entailed a dexterous control on phase morphology and interface interaction, and showed H2/CO2 and H2/N2 selectivity values of 9.43 and 260.47 which is about 1.5 fold increment compared to pristine matrimid. They further extended the work by using dual-layer hollow fibre membranes of PBI and matrimid and obtained H2/CO2 selectivity of 11.11 which further increased to 14.5 by chemical cross-linking [82]. The reverse selective membranes with a chemical-mediated mechanism can also be employed to make blended membranes for H2/CO2 separation. Salim et. al. [83] in 2018 scaled up the fabrication of thin-film composite membranes using polysiloxane cross-linked PVA selective layer on PSF support to obtain high CO2/H2 selectivity of 118. Similarly, Wong et. al. [84] in 2020 synthesized the PVA/PEBEX blended membranes onto porous PSF support to obtain CO2/H2 selectivity of 7.6. Further, membrane modification techniques such as cross-linking, copolymerization, and nanomaterial addition can also be applied to ensure high performance in reverse selective membranes. For example, Li et. al. [85] developed reverse selective membranes using interfacial polymerization method with reactivity selectivity, diffusivity selectivity and solubility selectivity in a single frame through the addition of various functional groups into the same polymer using the copolymerization method. Such membranes show high CO2 permeability and high CO2/gas selectivity [63]. Moreover, this concept may catalyze new developments in other gas separation membrane materials. A dual membrane separator is an alternate approach in gas separation, using which Xiao et. al. [86] in 2020 separated H2/CO2/CH4 mixtures with PDMS/PEI composite membranes with integrated polyimide (PI) polymer and confirmed simultaneous improvement in purity and recovery with increasing operating pressure. Polymer blending is the easiest approach for membrane fabrication with good reproducibility and processability as compared to other processes like copolymerization. In the case of reverse selective membranes, another type of polymer mixing can be done, which involves obstructing the polymer chain packing along with hindering the backbone mobility to promote CO2 gas molecule diffusion. The segmented copolymers with multiblock containing alternate flexible and rigid segments can serve as an interesting material as they provides the advantage of tuning various properties such as changing molecular structure, length and composition of the segments [87]. The selection of right copolymer combinations has a great impact on various mechanical and gas separation properties. For example- (1) a properly balanced degree of crystallinity and micro-phase separation can be achieved by using optimized molecular weights of different polyimides, which is required for better results, and (2) higher inter-penetration between hard and soft segments leads to lower CO2 permeability as well as CO2/H2 selectivity [88]. The blending of high permeability polymer with high selectivity polymer can be very effective for H2 separation. However, the difficulty in finding the two miscible polymers due to thermodynamical constraints caused by the low combinatorial entropy of mixing sometimes makes the process difficult [57]. Table 2 summarizes the hydrogen gas separation performance of different polymeric membranes."
8,Engineered polymeric membranes for hydrogen separation,
9,Surface modified polymeric membranes,"4.1 Surface modified polymeric membranes Seeing as conventional polymer membranes have low permeability and selectivity issues, several engineering methods have been used to address the flaws. For example, blending with other polymers, creating polymer composites with other organic and inorganic materials, and so on. These methods create some interfacial voids and porosity within the membrane, which aids in improving permeability. Furthermore, they improve selectivity by increasing membrane affinity for various gases. Besides this, other post-processing methods, such as ion implantation/track etching and plasma treatment, are used to create a path for increased diffusivity, and it also improves surface energy and other properties of the membranes. The mismatch in the polarity creates low interaction between the fillers and polymers. Sedimentation and aggregation of the fillers due to the nature, shape and size of the filler particles affects the membrane fabrication process. Also, the membrane fabrication gets impede due to the low solubility of some durable and heat-stable polymers like PBI. The surface treatment of the membranes with advanced methods such as functionalization with different groups like carboxyl and amino group not only aid the synthesis of the membrane but also ameliorate the membrane selectivity by promoting the facilitated transport, further these groups provides the active sites for the attachment of nanoparticles and inorganic compounds with the polymer matrix. Such treatments also provide the advantage of shape, size and charge alteration of the nanomaterials. For example, the sign of the surface charge can be altered by using different functionalities like carboxyl, hydroxyl and amino groups. This elucidated discussion reveals that membrane modification is the appealing route to improve the overall separation performance of the membranes. 4.1.1 Ion implanted/Track etched polymeric membranes Track etched polymeric membranes provides the advantages of high homogeneity, tunable pore size and porosity. The mechanism contains mainly two steps- (1) Swift heavy ion irradiation process to generate the tracks; (2) Chemical etching of the irradiated membranes to create the pores. The irradiation of energetic heavy ions on the polymer membranes leads to the excitation and ionization of the molecular chains and creates side or main chain scissioning, forms free radicals, and cross-linking of the polymer chains along the trajectory of the ions. These ions repel each other due to electrostatic force that creates vacancies and interstitials. Hence, the swift heavy ion irradiation process leads to the formation of latent ion tracks along their path. The process is then followed by chemical etching which transforms the latent ion tracks into the hollow channels as shown in Fig. 3 (a) [94]. While the porosity depends upon the irradiation process but the pore size, pore shape and density can be controlled by controlling the etching parameters. Further depending upon the requirements, the pore shape can be made conical, funnel-like, cylindrical or cigar-like, etc. (See Fig. 3 (b)) [95]. Awasthi et. al. [96] in 2011 used Cl+9 ion beam of fluence 107 ions/cm2 to irradiate PET membranes of 25 μm thickness. They further etched the membranes in 6 N NaOH solution for the generation of pores and observed that the permeability got increased rapidly after a particular etching time when the tracks got cylindrical and meet at the vertexes. Increasing the etching time initially increases the selectivity but after a certain time, it starts decreasing again due to the overlapping of pores as reported, an increase in H2/N2 selectivity from 2.79 to 3.38 with 20 min etching which again reduced to 2.82 with 45 min etching. Vijay et. al. [53] in 2008 combined the two independent techniques of polymer blending and ion irradiation by irradiating PC and PSF blended membranes using Ni ion beam of energy 100 MeV to generate tracks of 10–100 nm. The H2/CO2 selectivity of the irradiated membranes increases from 1.7 to 2.8 and reaches 5.5 with 5 min etching. In particular, the predetermined characteristics of the track etched membranes makes them an interesting candidate for H2 separation from the research point of view. Yet, the downside is to rely upon the availability of ion accelerators, additionally, the random arrangement of ion tracks diminishes the membrane performance. 4.1.2 Plasma etched polymeric membranes The gas plasma contains highly reactive particles that can gradually etch the membrane surface thus providing the possibility of determining the sublayer resistance. Several reports confirm that such treatment can greatly influence the overall performance of the membrane as by reducing the sublayer resistance, the overall selectivity of the thin layers can be improved [97]. Most recently, low-temperature plasma techniques are used for highly selective composite membranes like PTMSP and PVTMS films in gas separation membranes. These plasma treatments can be utilized both directly and indirectly. With direct treatment, certain reactive gases like O2 and NH3 are employed which can produce various amine or COOH type functionalities as well as free radicals. While with indirect treatment, different desired functionalities can be introduced by polymer grafting [98]. The plasma irradiation with optimized conditions can bring certain potential outcomes like- 1. Crosslinking- It alters the surface roughness, surface energy, hydrophilicity, and hydrophobicity of the membrane. It also promotes a uniform distribution of covalently linked functional groups. 2. Formation of polar groups- Plasma etching increases the pore diameter and porosity. 3. Radical recombination- It causes the formation of polymer films, with reduced porosity. 4.1.3 Functionalized polymeric membranes for hydrogen separation The membrane functionalization is an efficient technique for the deposition of various nanoparticles along the pore walls. It tunes the pore size of the membranes and also promotes facilitated transport. Different functionalization methods have been adopted by different researchers. Hu et. al. [99] reported carboxylic group functionalization using pulsed plasma deposition of maleic anhydride. Friebe et. al. [100] in 2007 functionalized the pores of PET membranes through surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization technique. Awasthi et. al. [69] in 2014 functionalized track-etched PET membranes with the carboxylic acid group through an oxidation reaction and amino groups by attaching a polyamine through amination. Further Pd nanoparticles deposition on the pore walls and pore surfaces of the membranes showed improved adhesion of the nanoparticles after functionalization as illustrated in Fig. 4 (a). Such membranes have the potential for hydrogen separation and sensing. As Pd nanoparticles have a high diffusivity towards hydrogen and are resistive to oxidation, they can be a better choice for the decoration on functionalized membranes. Such composite membranes can be a good alternative for hydrogen separation as compared to pure metallic membranes in terms of cost-effectiveness and separation efficiency. Other than pore functionalization, different functionalization possibilities involves surface functionalization or functionalization of filler particles to form MMM as shown in Fig. 4 (b). Kamakshi et. al. [101] in 2017 tested such membranes with H2 and CO2 gases and observed that the H2 permeability reduced with carboxylation and then with amination as compared to pristine membranes while the CO2 permeability remained unaffected showing high hydrogen absorption affinity of the membranes as shown in Fig. 4 (c). Depositing Pd nanoparticles further absorbed more hydrogen, again reducing the permeability. But the absorption process of H2 in Pd metal lattice is reversible. So, it got absorbed as well as diffused quickly. This idea leads Kumar et. al. [102] from the same group in 2017 to perform separate research where they obtained promising results towards hydrogen selectivity using Pd deposition in carboxylic group functionalized porous PET membranes. The membranes obtained were tested with H2, CO2 and N2 gases for the effect of carboxylation time and it was found that increasing the carboxylation time increased the H2 gas permeability due to the presence of carbonyl (CO) and carboxylic (COOH) groups that forms H-bonding as hydrogen acceptors and donors respectively. Further, the hydrogen absorption property of the Pd nanoparticles played a vital role and the maximum selectivity obtained was 6.05 and 3.72 for H2/CO2 and H2/N2 respectively. But after 6 h of functionalization, the selectivity got saturated. In a future experiment, the Pd nanoparticles deposition time was varied while keeping the carboxylic group functionalization confined to 6 h. The results confirmed increment in both permeability and selectivity with increasing Pd nanoparticles deposition time [103]. Other than chemical methods, UV irradiation provides another easier approach towards functionalization. In this regard, Ayoub et. al. [104] functionalized the polystyrene-polycarbonate blends using UV treatment and Hareesh et. al. [105] studied the effect of UV irradiation on polycarbonate. The process creates free radicals on the surface and pore walls of the membranes which can readily accept hydrogen while creating obstacles for other gas molecules. Kumar et. al. [106] in 2018 functionalized polycarbonate membranes by irradiating UV light and implanted Pd nanoparticles into the surface and pores of the membranes. The nanoparticles attachment was also enhanced using a PVP binder. With such membranes, the selectivity value of 3.43 and 3.92 was achieved for H2/N2 and H2/CO2, respectively. Kim et. al. [107] in 2021 modified PBI using benzoic acid to prepare PBI-HFA hollow fibre membranes using the dry-jet wet spinning method. The membranes showed remarkable H2/N2 and H2/CO selectivity values of 43.4 and 35.7, respectively. 4.1.4 Polymers crosslinking for hydrogen separation The method of chemical crosslinking has been extensively used by different researchers to improve the H2/CO2 selectivity of the polymeric membranes. Several cross-linkers like different alkyl amine groups provide different crosslinking network possibilities with the polymer matrix as shown in Fig. 5 . These cross-linking can create configurational changes into the polymeric structure by attaching the side groups to the backbone, thereby decreasing free volume and increasing size-sieving ability. Chung et. al. [108] in 2006 modified 6FDA-durene by diamino group using propane-1,3-diamine (PDA) solution and obtained high H2/CO2 selectivity of 101. Such surface modifications provide several advantages including- (1) a 3-dimensional cross-linked network structure can be achieved, (2) the interstitial space suitable for gas separation can be optimized, (3) such methods introduce hydrogen bonds in the material structure, (4) these modifications alter the chemical environment, for example, in polyimide membranes, they transfer the imide groups partially into amide groups. Lin et. al. [45] in 2006 prepared reverse selective membranes with high hydrogen permeability using cross-linked polyethylene oxide, in which the presence of polar ether oxygen groups interacts with CO2 to increase the solubility selectivity. They further modified the membranes by interrupting the EO repeating unit with short, non-crystallizable, non-PEO segments, which lowered the high crystallinity and made it more amorphous and suited for the separation procedure. Chen et. al. [88] in 2010 investigated the effect of various factors such as degree of crystallinity and inter-penetration between hard and soft segments on the gas separation performance and fractional free volume of the poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) containing copolyimide (PEO-PI) containing acid dianhydrides and diamines. They were able to achieve CO2 permeability of 179.3 barrer and CO2/H2 selectivity of 22.7 using such membranes. Hosseini et. al. [10] in 2008 prepared matrimid/polybenzimidazole (PBI) blended membranes and ameliorated the gas separation performance using two distinct cross-linking agents p-xylene diamine and p-xylene dichloride. They found that the crosslinking reagents restricts the segmental mobility of the polymer chain and increased H2/CO2 selectivity up to 26.09. Further, it is also observed that different polymers have a different effect of chemical crosslinking with diamines like 6FDA-durene membranes show a greater decline in permeability as compared to matrimid membranes due to the difference in electrophilicity of the two polyimides. Similarly, different diamines have different nucleophilicity that affects the crosslinking rate. Shao et. al. [109] in 2008 obtained high H2/CO2 and H2/N2 selectivity of 23 and 173 using matrimid membranes cross-linked with 1,4-butane diamine owing to the stronger electrophilicity of matrimid imide ring while with 6FDA-durene the values were 2.90 and 48.2, respectively. Exposure to a different environment is another trick of surface modification used by the researchers. For example, modification of the 6FDA-durene polyimide membranes with an exposure of EDA vapours for a stipulated time showed reduced d-spacing with the densification of the polymer chain, thus the H2 and CO2 permeability decreased but the decrement is large for larger kinetic diameter CO2 molecule. This increased the H2/CO2 selectivity from 1.03 to 37 after 5 min cross-linking time and 120 after 10 min cross-linking time for pure gases while the mixed gas selectivity increased from 0.33 to 7.88 to 16.6 for a binary mixture of H2 and CO2 gases. These results confirm the effectiveness of the vapour-phase modification strategy and also the approach is convenient and economically viable to be applied [21]. The method of cross-linking can be equally applied to an organic–inorganic material interface. In this regard, Shao et. al. [42] in 2009 prepared reverse-selective organic–inorganic hybrid membranes with an attractive CO2/H2 selectivity of 8.95. Such a combination of polymer poly (ethylene oxide) and inorganic silica with enhanced mechanical and thermal properties can be taken as good for hydrogen separation at an industrial scale. Shao et. al. [110] in 2013 used a semi-crystalline PEO based polymer membrane to separate CO2 from a mixture of H2 and CO2. The method comprised a green reaction system to mix amino group terminated O,O’-bis (2-aminopropyl) polypropylene glycol-block-polyethylene glycol-block-polypropylene glycol (PEO-600) and epoxy group terminated poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEO-526) in a liquid state to obtain cross-linked PEO membranes. The obtained membranes were tested with different gases to obtain good selectivity values of 6.84, 8.48, and 2.68 for CO2/H2, H2/N2 and H2/CH4, respectively. Similarly, in another experiment, Zhu et. al. [111] in 2017 tightened the polymer structure of PBI via chemical cross-linking in terephthaloyl chloride solutions and obtained H2/CO2 selectivity of 22. Such advanced synthesis routes provide the scope for exploring the areas to target the crystallinity of the material and also optimizing the fractional free volume for the separation process. However, these cross-linked polymers are not practically suitable at high temperatures. Omidvar et. al. [112] in 2019 overcame this problem by using thermally stable P84 membranes cross-linked with BuDA and obtaining H2/CO2 separation factor of 14 in the range 100–150 °C without compromising the permeability. Zhao et. al. [113] in 2019 synthesized a series of polyethylene oxide reverse selective membranes with star-like structure that showed CO2/H2 selectivity up to 11. In this work, the author used tetra-functional cross linker pentaerythritol tetracrylate (PET4A) as core and monofunctional PEO as shell to prepare the membranes, this changed the original ordered structure of chain segment into 3-D disordered structure with increased d-spacing and decreased chain flexibility. Also, the diffusivity selectivity and solubility selectivity of the membranes were found to be highly variable. Thus, polymer cross-linking is proved to be an impressive approach to modify physicochemical properties of the membrane’s outer surface without modifying the internal structure. However, it was observed that the membranes suffered from poor chemical stability and reduced hydrogen permeability due to increased resistance from the restricted polymeric chain [28]. Table 3 gives an overview of the hydrogen separation performance of different surface modified and engineered polymer-based membranes."
10,Metal coated polymeric membranes,"4.2 Metal coated polymeric membranes Different metals like nickel, platinum, palladium, copper, silver, iron, etc. are effective for hydrogen-based applications including separation, storage and sensing. Although Pd and Pd alloy based membranes dominated the market during the last decade the high thickness requirement (about 20–30 µm) to ensure mechanical stability makes them display lower flux while lowering the thickness lowers the mechanical strength. The idea of mixing with polymer and using porous support allows the thickness reduction below 1 µm and provides an increased flux at a reduced cost. Apart from Pd, other metals like Vanadium (V), Tantalum (Ta), etc. possess higher hydrogen permeation but these metal surfaces require high activation energy using high hydrogen pressure or high temperature for the dissociative adsorption of H2. On the other hand Pd with its superior catalytic activity for the dissociation of molecular hydrogen and high permeability for the atomic hydrogen is considered as most suitable. It is worthy to mention that although Pd is extremely selective towards hydrogen but at low-temperature H2 may lock inside the Pd lattice increasing the stress inside the membranes resulting in membrane failure. Doping Pd with other metals like silver, platinum can provide a remedy to the problem by protecting the lattice structure. Patel et. al. [68] in 2018 synthesized layered polymeric nano-composite membranes by coating 8–10 nm layer of Pd-Pt alloy and Iridium on polycarbonate using sputtering and observed that the permeability almost gets doubled for Ir coated membranes while it increased by almost 17% for Pd-Pt alloy coating. The metal coating enables developing the membranes with a highly selective metallic layer on the top of the polymeric membrane but the poor adhesion of the membrane with the support and element migration from support may cause membrane failure. Also, the difficulty in the fabrication of thin, dense metal composite membranes on the porous support with open structure at the interface between the metal and support layer creates a hurdle in achieving the required properties simultaneously [23]. Thus, instead of coating, mixing of metal particles into the matrix can be taken as a possible remedy as discussed in a further section."
11,Metal mixed composite membranes,"4.3 Metal mixed composite membranes The gas permeability is controlled through the diffusion of hydrogen molecules inside the metal [101]. On account of achieving higher permselectivity with good mechanical strength, metal mixing can be preferential over metal coating to avoid adhesion-related challenges. Different inorganic metal particles, hydride forming intermetallic compounds with high selectivity towards hydrogen can be used as a promising filler in the composite membranes. For example, the lanthanum-nickel alloy LaNi5 can absorb a large amount of hydrogen at room temperature and the hydride formed LaNi5H6 can easily release gaseous hydrogen on slight heating. Vijay et. al. [53] in 2008 doped hydrogen sensitive material Fe0.5Ti0.5 into polycarbonate matrix to obtain H2/CO2 selectivity of 2.5 on slightly increasing the temperature. Since the conventional membrane preparation techniques like solvent evaporation, solution casting, and temperature-induced, diffusion-induced phase separation generally lead to agglomeration of inorganic particles that create defects in the polymer matrix-filler interface. Thus, Strugova et. al. [2] in 2018 proposed a novel method of mechanical activation for metal-polymer composite membranes preparation in which the intermetallic compound and polyethylene powder was treated mechanically in high energy water-cooled planetary ball mill at different ratio before forming the membranes. It was found that the addition of LaNi5 increased the hydrogen permeability of the membranes drastically up to 3 orders of magnitude and with 10% LaNi5 filler concentration the selectivity value became 188 for H2/CH4, 132 for H2/CO2, 66 for H2/N2 and 83 for H2/O2."
12,Carbon doped composite membranes,"4.4 Carbon doped composite membranes 4.4.1 CNT composite membranes for hydrogen separation CNTs exhibit unique characteristics like high mechanical, chemical and thermal strength that make them a preferential candidate to be used as a filler particle. Further, the inherent smoothness of the interior channels, high aspect ratio, and smooth pore walls can contribute to accelerating gas transport. Such exceptional lumen side on the surface renders resistance-free transport thus increasing the flux [118]. With these features, CNTs can be anticipated as a precious root for enhancing separation performance. The incorporation of single-walled carbon nanotubes improved the transport diffusivities several magnitudes higher as compared to other materials like zeolites. Zhao et. al. [119] in 2014 incorporated CNTs into polysiloxane cross-linked PVA thin-film composite membranes to synthesize CO2-selective membranes with CO2/H2 selectivity of 43. The precise nanotube diameter can provide high selectivity. However, the non-uniform distribution in the membrane creates a challenge that still needs to tackle. The high Vander Waal forces between the CNTs makes them remain entangled agglomerate creating defect sides and non-selective voids into the membrane. Therefore, various techniques such as functionalization and grafting, proper ultra-sonication are exercised to ensure homogenous and complete individualized dispersion of CNTs into the matrix. CNTs can be easily oxidized in presence of strong acids like HNO3 or H2SO4 and also can be amine-modified. Such modifications alter the pore size and increase the gas adsorption site into the membranes. The alignment of CNTs can be taken as another way of dispersion. The proper alignment of CNTs into the membrane either by the electric or magnetic field can increase the gas permeability as compared to the random dispersion due to the availability of channels for transportation (See Fig. 6 (a)). The application of the field puts a twisting force on the CNTs to create a dipole–dipole interaction which forces them to align along the direction of the field. Sharma et. al. [120] in 2009 aligned SWCNTs and MWCNTs into polycarbonate matrix using electric field and obtained permeability increment to 350 barrer from 50 barrer. They obtained higher permeability in SWCNTs than MWCNTs due to better alignment of SWCNTs. Kumar et. al. [121] in 2010 aligned MWCNT in PMMA matrix using electric field and confirmed that the aligned MWCNT membranes showed almost two times higher H2 permeability as compared to the randomly aligned MWCNT. Kumar et. al. [122] in 2016 worked on MWCNT alignment through the polycarbonate polymer matrix using the magnetic field. Further, the idea of surface treatment by functionalization of pore walls followed by the deposition of palladium nanoparticles was used. The gas transportation was observed to be a combined effect of solution diffusion and molecular sieving effect. The MWCNT alignment increased the dissolution of gas molecules and hence permeability through the membrane while the Pd nanoparticles resulted in more absorption of hydrogen gas molecules. The maximum selectivity of 4.19 and 7.96 for H2/N2 and H2/CO2 was obtained for the Pd deposited functionalized aligned composite membranes. (See Fig. 6 (b,c)) The studies on the CNT composite membranes confirms that the optimum loading and improved dispersion can bring fruitful results in the direction of improvement of MMM for gas separation. 4.4.2 GO/rGO composite membranes for hydrogen separation Graphene-based membranes have piqued the interest due to their high mechanical and thermal stability, as well as the residing functional groups that allow for further structural tuning. The presence of delocalized п-electron cloud throughout the pure graphene structure blocks the penetration of any gas molecule, hence the other forms like GO and rGO are more preferable [123]. GO containing hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the basal and edge planes, interacts with the polar gases like CO2 and promotes the CO2 passage by increasing the solubility selectivity of the membrane towards the gas. On the other hand for gases like hydrogen, the GO incorporation increases the tortuous pathway resulting in the reduction in permeability and diffusion selectivity as illustrated in Fig. 6 (d). With this idea, Nigiz et. al. [3] in 2020 synthesized nanocomposite graphene oxide (GO) incorporated PDMS membrane for hydrogen purification by separating CO2 from bio-hydrogen syngas. Fig. 6 (e) confirms that the GO addition improved the CO2 permeability and thus the CO2/H2 selectivity got increased from 7.10 to 11.7 at 0.5 wt% GO loading into the polymer matrix. Also, increasing the membrane thickness caused structural changes into the membrane resulting in the increment of CO2/H2 selectivity. The incorporation of graphene-based materials into the polymer increases the mechanical properties due to the strong chemical interaction of the functional groups present in GO with the polymers. Some researchers have reported the use of hybrid nanocomposite to engineer the MMM by simultaneously incorporating different fillers with different properties to enhance the dispersion quality as well as separation properties. The idea is one filler can increase the separation selectivity while the other can intensify the permeability. Li et. al. [124] in 2015 incorporated CNT and GO nanosheets into matrimid matrix to improve the gas separation properties. Different groups have reported different methods to fabricate multilayered graphene membranes onto the support layer like spin coating, vacuum filtration, etc. The most popular way among them is vacuum filtration, however, it is prone to non-uniform packing of GO sheets and sometimes leads to wrinkled structure. Guan et. al. [125] in 2017 and Ibrahim et. al. [126] in 2018 minimized the drawback by using spray evaporation-induced self-assembly technique and achieve uniform coverage of the substrate with strong H2/CO2 selectivity. The interlayer spacing or d-spacing in the GO laminates behaves like slits, and these slits can be varied to improve the separation qualities. Lin et. al. [127] in 2018 inserted an EDA cross-linker with GO and improved the H2 permeance up to 166% due to increased inter-layer spacing, but it reduced the H2/CO2 selectivity to 33%. Furthermore, the interlayer spacing can also be altered by changing the synthesis method. Ibrahim et. al. [128] in 2019 synthesized GO by modified Brodie’s method to coat on polyester membranes. The gas permeation results confirmed that GO (modified Brodie’s method) engrossed membranes showed an increment in H2/CO2, H2/N2, and H2/CH4 selectivity by 129%, 91%, and 76%, respectively as compared to the membranes engrossed with GO (modified Hummer’s method). (See Table 4 .) As the other approaches, such as Hummer's method and chemical vapor deposition, are more time-consuming, robust, and broad. Thus a new approach of Laser-induced graphene (LIG) is being used in which the polymer substrate is photo thermally transformed into graphene using a CO2 laser. Moreover, the method provides the advantages of controlling the power and speed parameters to improve the quality of the LIG layer formed. The CO2 laser power determines the amount of energy exposed to the sample per second, which determines the depth of the graphitic layer formed, and the laser speed determines the time for which the laser is engaged with the sample, which controls the amount of LIG per unit area. Using the technique, Mishra et. al. [129] in 2021 fabricated LIG/polysulfone membranes having H2/CO2 selectivity value of 30.5."
13,Zeolite based polymeric membranes,"4.5 Zeolite based polymeric membranes In today’s scenario, the direction of research is oriented to introduce new membranes and membrane materials that can overcome the tradeoff. Zeolites are porous aluminosilicate materials made from silicon, aluminium and oxygen in a covalent network structure that possesses the ability to molecular sieve or selectively sort molecules based on the size exclusion principle. The introduction of porous zeolite particles can increase both the permeability and selectivity with its outstanding features like high thermal stability, superior ion-exchange capacity, different adsorption rates depending upon the size of the gas molecule, proper combination of solubility and diffusivity. Furthermore from the crystallography point of view, the zeolite particles possess polymorphism which can give impact to the separation performance of the membranes [130]. The polymer-zeolite mixed matrix membranes can bridge the gap between polymers and inorganic phases but the poor contact still creates defects in the membranes. Due to this, the interface morphology between the zeolites and polymer phase is optimized through certain methods like- (i) promoting the adhesion between polymer and zeolites through modifications by coupling agents, (ii) applying high temperature close to the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer i.e. annealing, (iii) priming the particle’s surface. Moreover, surface-initiated polymerization is the frequently used technique to improve polymer-zeolite adhesion in the mixed matrix membranes. Khan et. al. [131] in 2010 prepared zeolite/polysulfone mixed matrix membranes and obtained increment in H2/CO2 mixed gas selectivity from 1.53 to 3.57 with increased zeolite loading. Razakazemi et. al [132] in 2012 studied the hydrogen gas transport properties of zeolite-A/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite membranes and obtained H2/CO2 and H2/CH4 selectivity values of 3.23 and 8.67 respectively. According to the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, the addition of zeolite increases the gas solubility of mixed matrix membranes. Rezakazemi et. al. [133] in 2012 observed an increased H2/CH4 sorption selectivity to 11 by adding zeolite 4A to PDMS membranes. The above discussion confirms that the zeolite nanoparticles with their remarkable properties can be taken as a strong candidate for the modern purification industry."
14,Metal-organic framework composite membranes,"4.6 Metal-organic framework composite membranes Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), fabricated by unifying metal ions or their clusters with different organic linkers, are highly porous materials offering tunable pore size as well as chemical functionality. The organic linkers present in MOFs results in better compatibility with the organic polymers enabling higher loading in comparison to other additives [134,135]. Zeolite imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) is an important subclass of MOFs where the structural similarities with zeolite offer high surface area and thermal stability and the properties like pore size tunability and chemical functionality corresponds to MOFs that provides structural diversity [136]. The small pores at the entrance offer a molecular sieving effect for small size molecules like hydrogen while the large internal cavities favour rapid diffusion [137,138]. Several ZIF-polymer composite membranes using ZIF-7, ZIF-8, ZIF-22, ZIF-90, ZIF-100, etc. have been reported to significantly improve H2 separation but ZIF-8 is successfully commercialized and widely used due to its higher stability and better resistance to acid and alkaline environment [60]. The flexible composite membranes prepared using 50/50 (w/w) nano-sized ZIF-7/PBI provided high hydrogen permeability with good H2/CO2 selectivity of 7.2 with mixed gases while 14.9 with pure gases. The membranes successfully overcame the major challenges of PBI matrix, like low flux due to high chain packing density and brittleness [139]. Nagaraiu et. al. [54] in 2013 obtained H2/CO2 selectivity of 3.8 and 7.2 with ZIF-8 and CuBTC based MOF layers synthesized on asymmetric polysulfone by in-situ crystallization followed by a layer-to-layer deposition method. Despite the positive aspect of high physical adhesion and improved selectivity, the membranes showed a reduction in permeability. The work demonstrated a new methodology to obtain continuous and denser MOF@polymer composite membranes without any need of pre-seeding but it needs further modifications for practical utility. Wijenayake et. al. [140] in 2013 added tetrahedral porous framework ZIF-8 into 6FDA-durene polyimide and further combined the cross-linking and mixed matrix membranes approach for the membrane synthesis. It was found that with 33.3 wt% nanocrystalline ZIF-8 in 6FDA-durene the permeability increased up to 412% for H2 gas. Although the method improved H2 permeability to its full potential, the selectivity was not realized so in a separate experiment, the author further coated the membranes with a thin layer of cross-linkable polymer 6FDA-durene and exposed them to EDA vapours that improved the gas pair selectivity towards H2/CO2, H2/N2 and H2/CH4 to 29, 341, and 278 values respectively while maintaining the high permeability[141]. The different gas separation results for the same material combinations shows that changing the membrane fabrication method alters the morphology and hence gas separation performance may improve. Knebel et. al. [142] in 2016 fabricated MOF based mixed matrix membranes using MIL-96(Al) and matrimid as a selective layer through different fabrication routes and obtained H2/CO2 selectivity varying from 6 to 10 for the different methods. Annealing the membranes below transition temperature can also improve the MOF-polymer adhesion along with synergistic contribution in gas separation. The annealing process results in the partial densification of the membrane which improves the selectivity while the presence of MOF layer reduces the densification at those polymer sites which could decrease the permeability and results in the reordering of the polymer chain and creation of new inter-and intra-molecular π-interactions. This hypothesis provided a maximum H2/CH4 selectivity value of 103 and 101 using ZIF-8@P84 and ZIF-93@P84 membranes, respectively [143]. Further, Chen et. al. [60] in 2020 used a different approach of CO2 selective membranes for H2 purification by combining the solubility and reaction selectivity. They modified ZIF-8 by adding tannic acid to improve the CO2 adsorption. Also, in order to make stable distribution of particles, they enhanced the compatibility between the fillers and PVAm by cross-linking through Micheal addition reaction. The synthesized membranes showed a good CO2/H2 selectivity value of 31 and the results showed the potential of the membranes for syngas purification in the industrial level with a reasonable rate at the IGCC power plant. Apart from the metal–organic framework, covalent organic framework (COF) has been widely investigated for gas separation application owing to the outstanding structural flexibility, pore size tenability, high surface area and remarkable thermal stability. Fu et. al. [144] in 2016 combined the pre-eminent properties of covalent organic framework and metal–organic framework by growing MOF layer over COF and obtained a high separation factor of 12.6 and 13.5 for [COF-300]-[Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)] and [COF-300]-[ZIF-8] composite membranes towards H2/CO2 which was higher than their counterparts i.e. 6, 7 and 9.1 for COF-300, Zn2(bdc)2(dabco) and ZIF-8 membranes respectively. In a typical mixed matrix membrane, the membranes are much thicker than the size of embedded fillers, making the polymer matrix surround the filler particles. Thus, both the permeability and selectivity are greatly influenced by the non-selective polymer matrix and as a result, the conventional MMM reflects less improvement in gas separation. The concept of bicontinuity is a new and effective approach where the size of the filler is larger than the film thickness such that the filler penetrates both the surfaces providing dominant pathways for gas transportation. Inspired by the concept of bicontinuity, Ma et. al. [41] in 2019 introduced ZIF-7 into polyimide in such a way that each ZIF-7 particle protrudes at both the upper and bottom side of the membrane in a perfect orientation, thus providing direct pathways. With ZIF-7 channels as the dominant pathways, the MMM favoured high molecular sieve performance and showed H2/CO2 and H2/CH4 selectivity values of 91.5 and 128.4 respectively along with high H2 permeability. Such advanced fabrication approaches are required for the effective commercialization of the membranes where simple and rapid preparation techniques can reduce the complexity and impracticality of the conventional mixed matrix membranes that take several days to fabricate."
15,Recently discovered/advanced polymers for hydrogen separation,"Although the currently used polymer gas separation membranes possess high selectivity, but they generally suffer from low permeability thus requiring a large membrane size for sufficient production. The use of microporous polymers with a rigid network structure can provide high gas permeability along with good selectivity [160]. Different microporous polymers like polyacetylene derivative membranes demonstrated high permeability but they suffered from low selectivity [161]. During the last decade, a new class of microporous polymers were widely studied, these include polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM), conjugated microporous polymers (CMP) and thermally rearranged (TR) polymers [162]. Certain polymers like functionalized polyimides are converted into rigid structures via thermal reactions. The heat-induced structural changes occurring between 350 °C and 450 °C alters the chain conformations and spatial locations of the moieties [163]. This thermal rearrangement creates interconnected micropores to provide rapid transportation up to two orders of magnitude than the previous polymers enhancing the permselectivity as well as thermostability [162]. Han et. al. [163] in 2010 produced a thermally rearranged PBI membrane that displayed increased H2 permeability with advantageous H2/CO2 selectivity at 120 °C surpassing 2008 upper bound. Smith et. al. [164] in 2019 used thermally rearranged (TR) polymer (6FDA-HAB5DAM5) and ultra-porous PAF-1 particles to prepare mixed matrix membranes. The combination of the two different effective approaches demonstrated up to a 37-fold increment in H2 permeability without affecting the selectivity. These new and advanced microporous materials have found their place in the third generation membrane materials and the membranes have surpassed the upper bound. They offer the advantage of post-synthesis modifications in which multiple functional groups can be introduced simultaneously or through step by step method to meet the desired properties as sometimes direct synthesis of functional groups is restricted or avoided due to the reaction conditions. Also, they offer the advantage of tuning pore structure as per the requirement [165]."
16,Polymers of intrinsic microporosity for hydrogen separation,"5.1 Polymers of intrinsic microporosity for hydrogen separation Various researchers have obtained high H2 selectivity of the order of 50–60 for both H2/N2 and H2/CH4 using conventional membrane materials like polysulfone (PSF), polycarbonate (PC), cellulose acetate (CA) [166], etc. but the low permeability value limits the practical utility on large scale [167]. In this regard, designing new polymers like Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIM) having complex and rigid polymeric chain due to the presence of ladder-like backbone and flexible dioxane structure with well-defined microcavities was found to be advantageous [162]. The porosity of these polymers due to poor packing of linear polymer chain makes them solution-processable [168] and the resulted microporous structured membranes have the advantage of controllable free volume [169]. PIMs are rationally engineered materials which include PIM-1, PIM-7, poly (1-trimethylsilyl-1-propyne) (PTMSP), poly (4-methyl-2-pentyne), etc. having high permeability as a result of contortion sites that disrupts the packing [170,171]. PIM-1 membranes provide higher CO2 and H2 permeability of around 3500–5000 and 1500–3000 barrer respectively which is several orders higher than the traditional polymers. Bushell et. al. [138] in 2013 obtained high gas permeability up to 6680 and 6300 barrer for H2 and CO2 respectively using mixed matrix membranes prepared from PIM-1 and ZIF-8 filler at different concentrations. With these membranes, they were able to obtain selectivity values of 19.1 and 15.5 for H2/N2 and H2/CH4 respectively. The higher permeability of H2 can be attributed to its smaller kinetic diameter while CO2 has higher condensability with the polymer. Since higher permeability is usually coupled with lower selectivity; various methods have been used by the researchers to tailor the physicochemical properties of these membranes to get the direct benefits of diffusivity thus enhancing H2 selectivity without affecting the permeability. These include UV photo-oxidation and thermal-oxidation crosslinking of the membrane for tuning the surface and microporous structure. In this regard, Ghalei et. al. [73] in 2017 used surface oxidative polymerization of polydopamine (PDA) and polyaniline (PANI) on the surface of high free volume microporous PIM-1 and poly(1-trimethylsilyl-1-propyne) (PTMSP) and showed that delicately controlling the process can enhance the H2 selectivity. The presence of PDA and PANI increased the diffusive selectivity for the H2 molecule and thus the H2/CO2 selectivity got increased from 0.55 to 6.5 and 45 for PANI and PDA respectively. The inclusion of porous frameworks (PAF-1) like fillers can be advantageous for both permeability and selectivity as on one side they provide free volume for faster transport while on the other side they tighten the polymer chain packing to refine the molecular sieving effect. This idea led Hou et. al. [170] in 2019 to use PIF-1 with phenazine-containing triptycene ladder polymers (TPIM) for obtaining high H2 gas permeability and selectivity. Further observations on PIM, TPIM-2 and their composites reveal an increase in hydrogen selectivity upon ageing. The density value of PIMs increases with time and as a consequence, the porosity and free volume decrease. This results in irreversible changes in the structure, permanent chemical alteration and primary atomic bond disruption. Ageing also occurs with temperature change [66], larger molecules like N2 and CH4 lose permeability faster as compared to smaller molecules like H2 and He. This tendency of high-free volume polymers increases the selectivity of lighter gases over heavy gases with time. Hou et. al. [167] in 2020 observed H2/N2 selectivity increment from 27 to 78 for 5 wt% PAF-1/TPIM-2 polymer composite membrane after two months ageing while the increment was from 19.5 to 35.2 for pristine TPIM-2. This confirmed that along with providing more transport channels PAF-1 also accelerated the ageing process. But the sensitive and convoluted synthesis method makes it unsuitable for large scale applications. Alternatively, a highly scalable, simple and cost-effective cross-linked polymer polydichloroxylene (pDCX) having anti-ageing and permeability enhancement potential with PIMs can be used as a replacement of PAF-1 in future [170]. Another similar polymer TPIM-1 having rigid- paddlewheel structure of bridgehead-substituted triptycene moiety provided the higher selectivity value of almost 50 for both H2/N2 and H2/CH4. This selectivity is comparable to that reported for commercial polysulfone and Matrimid except the fact that using TPIM-1 increased the H2 permeability up to a 150–folds higher value [172]."
17,Conjugate microporous polymers for hydrogen separation,"5.2 Conjugate microporous polymers for hydrogen separation Organic microporous materials like porous organic cages (POCs) are also extensively studied as they form homogenous microporous membranes. But the cage molecules assembled by the weak Vander Waal forces in the process of obtaining homogenous membrane gets slide over each other with thermal or mechanical agitation which limits their selectivity. It is worth pointing that the conjugated microporous polymers combine the advantages of both conjugate and porous materials. The extreme rigidity to the cross-linked network and variability in pore size with narrow pore size distribution makes it an appropriate candidate for the next generation gas separation. Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) with π-conjugated networks can persist their microporosity in the presence of water vapours and acid gases even at high temperature and pressure conditions. But the extremely cross-linked structure certainly leads to poor processability and broad pore size distribution is a matter of concern. Thus to meet the structural rigidity and solution processability demands, Liu et. al. [160] in 2020 synthesized a solution-processable conjugated microporous thermoset (CMT) with permanent pores of about 0.4 nm and used it as a two-dimensional molecular sieving membrane for hydrogen separation. The contributions from intrinsic microporosity and interlayer spacing lead CMT membranes to achieve an ultrahigh H2 permeability of 28,280 barrer at 30 °C with good selectivity values of 6.3, 10.6, 11.3 and 10.9 for H2/CO2, H2/O2, H2/N2 and H2/CH4 respectively and the H2 permeability increased by almost 40% without affecting the selectivity at 150 °C. Further, the membranes were thermally stable up to 500 °C with no decay in performance for 700 h at 150 °C."
18,Block copolymers for hydrogen separation,"5.3 Block copolymers for hydrogen separation Recently, block copolymers (BC) with well-defined morphology has emerged out as a new membrane material for the gas separation process. The presence of two or more distinct polymer chains of chemical difference is linked covalently to provide the capability of developing a periodic nanostructure arrangement through the microphase separation resulting in the formation of various ordered structures like spheres, cylinders, double diamonds (bicontinuous). Out of them, the presence of well-defined nano-cylinder domains having perpendicular orientations with respect to the surface plays a key role in membrane filtration [173]. The morphology of the block copolymers depends upon certain factors like block fraction, solvent type, vaporization rate, annealing time and temperature. Thus, by changing the solvent evaporation approach the alignment and arrangement of microdomain in the block copolymer can be changed as a high evaporation rate favours vertical orientation whereas with low evaporation rate parallel orientation is obtained [174]. While a homogenous porous structure can be achieved through proper solvent annealing and etching, but the higher cost of pore symmetrical block copolymer freestanding membranes limits its practical application. With this concern, Kamakshi et. al. [175] in 2017 used block copolymer solution of Poly(styrene)-block-poly (4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) and small organic molecule 2-(4′-hydroxybenzeneazo) benzoic acid at a lower concentration to coat onto a porous PET substrate. Though it successfully synthesized the block copolymer membranes at a lower cost, but the membranes showed a reduction in permeability and only a slight increment in selectivity. Further, in another experiment [22] with slight modifications in the composite membrane preparation steps, they obtained a remarkable improvement in gas permeability as well as selectivity. Instead of coating the block copolymer solution directly, they first functionalized the porous PET substrate with a carboxyl group, then coated the BC solution and finally dipped the membranes in Pd nanoparticles solution for improvement in selectivity. (The schematic is shown in Fig. 7 (a)) It was found that all the membranes were highly permeable for H2 gas while both the permeability and selectivity increased continually with the increasing loading time of Pd nanoparticles. Fig. 7 (b,c) represents the gas permeability and selectivity data obtained for the membranes. Ito et. al. [93] in 2020 studied the gas transport properties of mechanically and thermally stable ABA triblock copolymers synthesized from polyimide and hydrophilic adamantane derivatives using atom transfer radical polymerization method to obtain a high H2/N2 selectivity value of 25.4 with PI/3-hydroxy-1-adamantyl methacrylate (HAdMA) and 28.5 with PI/3,5-dihydroxy-1-adamantyl methacrylate (DHAdMA) respectively. Such techniques can pave the way to the development of more stable polymer composite membranes with attractive properties for hydrogen separation. Further, the use of smart stimuli based membranes can be a significant step in the direction of hydrogen separation as illustrated in Fig. 7 (d). Table 5 provides an idea of the hydrogen gas separation performance of polymer-based nano-composite membranes using advanced polymers."
19,Comparison with Robeson upper bound,"Since the upper bound chart provides a commonly accepted representation of the separation performance of any membrane material. Fig. 8 (a) depicts the general behaviour of gas separation performance of various types of membranes for the experimentally observed Robeson Upper bound curve. It can be interpreted that the performance of polymeric membranes lies below the upper bound line, whereas the performance of inorganic membranes is above the upper bound, which is close to the commercially interesting area, but the brittleness and high-cost factors of these membranes cause most research to be directed towards polymeric membranes. The separation performance of MMM lies on the upper bound curve [180,49]. Several membrane engineering and modifications are carried out by the researchers to reach the membrane performance to the ideal case. New polymer materials, hybrids of organic and inorganic materials, and other innovations are among them. Although this has passed the upper bound curve, it still necessitates the production of continuous defect-free membranes with high mechanical strength, which is a huge issue. The presence of holes, cracks and crevices during and after synthesis may result in selectivity losses [181–183]. Fig. 8 (b, c, d) shows the comparison of H2 gas separation performance with Robeson Upper bound for different gas pairs like H2/N2, H2/CO2 and H2/CH4, discussed above in the article. Type 1 refers to traditional polymer-based membranes, Type 2 to conjugate polymer-based membranes, Type 3 to polymer blending, and Type 4 to functionalized polymer membranes using various functionalization processes such as UV irradiation, chemical functionalization, and so on. Membranes generated through polymer cross-linking are classified as Type 5. Type 6 membranes are metal/polymer composite membranes formed by incorporating metal particles into the polymer matrix, Type 7 membranes are CNT/polymer composite membranes, Type 8 membranes are graphene/polymer composite membranes, Type 9 membranes are zeolite/polymer composite membranes, Type 10 membranes are MOF/polymer composite membranes, Type 11 membranes are made up of advanced polymers such PIMs, Type 12 membranes are made up of thermally rearranged polymers, Type 13 membranes are made up of CMP polymers, and Type 14 membranes are made up of block copolymers. The upper bound tradeoff line and location of gas separation data in Fig. 8 reveal that most polymer-based membranes' separation performance is below the upper bound, but in certain cases, the engineered and modified membranes have shown outstanding improvements in separation properties, causing the data to be shifted above the upper bound line, opening up new opportunities for the application. The gas separation data location of standard polymer membranes is somewhat shifted as a result of modifications, which can be explained as- (i) The shift to the right in the graph confirms the formation of interfacial voids via the formation of aggregates or channels, which increases the porosity and thus the permeability of the membranes, while the selectivity may or may not change. Such behavior is shown by certain polymer composite membranes, those including CNT/polymer, and MOF/polymer composite and PIM based membranes. (ii) In some cases, such as conjugate polymer-based membranes and polymer-blended membranes, the graph shows a slight shift to the left side below the upper bound line, confirming the rigidification of the polymer chain, which reduces permeability while slightly improving selectivity [4,184,185]. Sometimes, the permeability is also reduced due to the partial blockage of sieve pores by polymer chains [186,187]. The comparison graph above can be used to draw an effective conclusion on the use of various types of membrane materials. It can be inferred that the conventional polymers suffered from lower permeability and selectivity issues for all three gas pairs, while the conjugate polymer membranes improved selectivity value, but the membranes suffered from lower permeability issues due to the highly dense and rigid structure. This problem of lower permeability was certainly improved by using the concept of polymer blending as impeding the flexible units softens the rigid network and increases the d-spacing of the material and thus permeability is improved, also the selectivity is improved for both H2/N2 and H2/CH4 gases but the selectivity is decreased for H2/CO2 gas pair due to the higher interaction of CO2 molecule with certain materials such as those with п- conjugation and polar groups present in their structure, the solubility of CO2 is higher into these material. Although, functionalization greatly improved the permeability of the membranes, but there was no significant improvement in hydrogen selectivity. Both CNT/polymer and metal/polymer composite membranes showed a moderate increment in selectivity but a sharp increment in permeability is observed in the case of aligned CNTs. The zeolite/polymer MMM shows high selectivity for H2/N2 and H2/CH4 but the selectivity value was low for H2/CO2 gas. Similarly, MOF/polymer shows high selectivity values particularly for H2/N2 and H2/CH4 separations. The competitive sorption of diffusivity selectivity and solubility selectivity for H2 and CO2 gas molecules has resulted in lower selectivity values for the gas pair, particularly in the case of functionalized and cross-linked membranes and the use of any CO2-sorptive filler. It is also be observed that the membranes synthesized with advanced polymers such as thermally rearranged polymers, conjugated microporous polymers and block copolymers has a high value of permeability along with a moderate increase in selectivity due to the presence of homogenous or inhomogeneous porous cages. Hence the exceptional separation performance of these membranes represents a significant step forward in the direction of material development, enabling their potential in hydrogen recovery and purification. [188]. Furthermore, this gas separation data has surpassed the upper bound with modifications, indicating that these membranes have better hydrogen separation properties. This can be attributed to the combined effect of membrane modification and the higher margin between the molecular weight of the gases with respect to the hydrogen molecule, indicating that the membranes have better hydrogen separation properties [123,160]. The intuitional conclusion to be drawn from the upper bound plot is that high hydrogen permeances can be obtained by several means such as reducing the thickness of the dense selective layer, lowering the gas phase resistance and inserting porous/non-porous fillers to create voids and increase the free volume. While high selectivity can be achieved by reducing defects and macrovoids, and adding some gas selective material into the membrane."
20,Current challenges with membrane separation technology,"With the advantages of low cost, high stability and ease of processing, the conventional polymeric membranes are dominating the market but the tradeoff relationship between the permeability and selectivity is undoubtedly causing the impairment in its practical usage [4]. Currently, gas separation membranes are used with moderate volume/low-pressure gas streams due to flux and selectivity issues related to membranes as sometimes they get punctured with high pressure that creates hurdles in their application on large scale. The membrane lifespan is another challenge hampering the growth of the market as after a certain period, the membrane durability decreases and they require replacement which increases the maintenance costs. In track-etched membranes pore shape, size and porosity can be tuned by varying etching time, etching conditions, choice of ions and its fluence during the irradiation process. But they suffer from the issues like availability of ion accelerators, non-uniform pore density and random arrangement of ion tracks. The use of MMM and other membrane engineering methods provides a way to overcome the problems, but the poor interfacial contact between the continuous polymer phase and inorganic particles may result in non-selective voids at the interface causing low selectivity or sometimes the membranes to encounter the problem of polymer chain rigidification or pore blockage in case of porous fillers [189,131]. Thus it is essential to achieve a good interaction and adhesion between the filler nanoparticles and the polar matrix to get higher selectivity. Also for good separation results, homogenous distribution of the fillers are required within the membrane[3]. Although, some approaches like the use of compatibilizers and increasing surface roughness on the particles can increase the interfacial contact but any significant improvement in gas separation ability was not observed. Thus there is a requirement for new strategies for improving the interfacial adhesion of the particle-polymer phase and also increasing the relative loading of the additives [140]. The methods of membrane modifications by cross-linking and adding some functional groups can help a lot with increased selectivity but the comparatively complex process makes it impractical from the engineering perspective at present [28]. The problem can also be somewhat tackled by the size exclusion principle using crystalline porous materials like zeolites, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). These materials can be directly deposited onto the membrane substrate or mixed with polymers to form mixed matrix membranes. But the phase segregation, chemical durability, difficulty in obtaining the defect-free films on large scale due to their brittle and insoluble nature is a matter of concern. To avoid the paradox between processability and separation performance, polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIM) was used. With the availability of free volume up to 20% [66], the PIM membranes gained a lot of attention but they still face the issues like plasticization effect, low selectivity due to wide pore size distribution and easy sliding of the inner polymeric chain over each other [4]. The high permeability of PIM membranes for both CO2 and H2 gas molecules owing to greater condensability and smaller kinetic diameter also affects the selectivity value a lot. Coating with different polymers having rigid structures and functionalities can reduce the problem but sometimes the greater microporosity requires a thicker layer with longer coating time to control the passage of gases which also can affect the final performance of the membrane [73]. The use of reverse selective membrane can be a different approach for separating hydrogen, it can also avoid the problem of H2 recompression but at high temperature and pressure conditions, they sometimes lose their performance in terms of selectivity due to increased H2 diffusivity. Thus, most recently the researchers are more focused on H2-selective membranes. Apart from this, other challenges like high cost, availability and complexities in the synthesis process create obstacles in the direction of MMM synthesis on which the work needs to be done. Table 6 gives a brief overview of the current challenges with the membrane-based gas separation technology with their possible solution."
21,Conclusion and future outlook,"The review compiles the advancement in different polymeric membranes for hydrogen separation. All the literature inputs have clearly demonstrated the potentialities of different materials, fillers and polymers to combine effectively for carrying out the purpose of industrial application of hydrogen separation. Several strategies have been used by the researchers to deal with the low selectivity and stability related problems but these are also accompanied by the issues like reduced gas permeability, cost expenses, etc. Mostly the problems are treated temporarily rather than fully solving them. The poor compatibility between the nanofillers and polymer matrix is a matter of concern among researchers. But the challenge can be effectively overcome by enhancing the physical interaction of the particles with the polymers using hydrogen bonding [59], or electrostatic interaction [190] or creating a chemical bridge between the polymer and the particle [60]. Methods like polymer functionalization have improved the compatibility of the main matrix with certain fillers thus made the membrane fabrication comparatively facile and easier to scale up. Incorporating selective and non-selective fillers influence the interface morphology and disrupt the chain packing that constructs the diffusion path for the gas molecules. The new and substantial progress in intrinsically microporous polymers provided a paradigm in the membrane progress by yielding high performance in the gas separation. In particular, maintaining a subtle balance between inter-chain spacing and inter-chain rigidity represents a major step forward in the material development and their gas separation results completely correspond to the great dexterity to expand the industrial horizons of polymer membranes for gas separation. In this review, we critically focused on the favourable materials with high hydrogen permselectivity and their phenomenology involving hydrogen transfer. The key remarks include- 1. The polymer nanocomposite membranes can entirely replace the traditional approaches for hydrogen separation. 2. Although the polymer nanocomposite membranes combine the features of both organic and inorganic filler particles and the polymer matrix, a number of comprehensive experiments are necessary to bridge the technical gap between laboratory and commercial gas separation. 3. Different recently developed and advanced polymers, such as thermally rearranged (TR) polymers, polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), conjugate microporous polymers (CMPs) and block copolymers (BC) have been synthesized in addition to membrane engineering. These have enhanced the separation performance much more, but there is still research to be done. At present, even with the most advanced technology and decades of research, the existing membranes are not sufficient enough in meeting the demands for the greatest purity and large-scale applications. Although the hybrid system in MMM and various membrane engineering methods have provided some of the most exciting accomplishments in the field, some basic issues such as membrane failures and low separation performance still require some innovative solutions to achieve the required outcomes at the industrial level. The remote control of gas transportation parameters by external stimuli is highly desired in addition to a facile synthesis strategy. Liu et. al [191] in 2018 synthesized smart photo-switchable MOF based membranes that can be reversibly switched in terms of the interfacial characteristics and mass transfer by UV irradiation. The structural tuning between cis- and trans-phase leads to a notable change in H2/CO2 mixture separation factor from 21.3 to 43.7. Embedding such stimuli-responsive materials into flexible polymers as illustrated in Fig. 7 (d) can provide a number of advantages. Such methods provide the possibilities to alter the membrane morphology, pores shape of the membranes and hence the gas transport properties changes. Also, the introduction of smart behaviour in membranes allows for a more self-regulated and intensified separation process. In the case of reverse selective membranes, the membrane engineering approaches can also be employed as incorporating specific functional groups can intensify the permeation process. For example, adding amine and carboxylate group enhances the reactivity selectivity due to reversible reactions with polar gases such as CO2, while some other groups such as carboxyl group, sulfonic acid and ether oxygen (EO) groups having strong affinity for CO2 can enhance the solubility selectivity. Further, the separation performance can also be improved by combining Vander Waal interactions, Lewis acid-base interactions and reversible reactions with CO2. In addition, using segmented copolymers with multi-block containing alternate flexible and rigid segments to obstruct the polymer chain packing alongwith hindering the backbone mobility can be beneficial. Different parameters can also be optimized by working on the morphological alteration of the copolymer through experiments with different properties of the segments such as molecular structure, length and composition of the segments. Apart from this, work should also be done on the system to produce a fast and accurate optimization approach to meet the numerous feed and separation demands. The collective efforts of the research community have made a continuous improvement in the polymeric nano-composite membranes but still, a lot of future work must be done in order to get the full potential of the membrane technology for the hydrogen economy. Some of them are listed as- 1. The combination of the electropolymerization method and the SAR strategy can be tested with different monomers to design polymeric membranes with rigid and intrinsic pores to achieve a balance of processability, permeability and selectivity [4]. 2. The use of colloidal ZIF suspension may be a viable future approach for minimizing particle aggregation and improving particle polymer interaction [140]. 3. The exploration of various membrane materials based on various monomers and other filler materials, as well as their modifications and combinations with other fillers to make composites, has a broad scope in the area. 4. To control on-demand flux, new membranes can be created with stimuli-responsive materials that responds to external stimulus such as temperature, light, pH, electric and magnetic fields, and their scope during the experiment can be tested. 5. In addition to the conventional strategies, the reverse selective membranes’ structures and materials can be optimized to provide a combination of multiple-selectivities such as solubility, reactivity and diffusivity selectivity to increase overall performance. 6. While membrane engineering is beneficial for improving the membrane materials but the use of computational tools can be a good and effective approach for sorption and diffusion-like properties [165]. Experts should be attentive to the implementation of such trends."
