0,Introduction,"Hydrogen can be produced from oxygenated hydrocarbons. For choosing from among several families of oxygenated fuels, alcohols are the better candidates to produce hydrogen. Specifically, methanol has attracted great interest regarding its potential application for fuel cells [1–4]. However, both health issues and environmental impact hinder the utilization of methanol. As an alternative to methanol, ethanol is better suited to this purpose as it is less toxic, has a high hydrogen content, offers more environmental protection, and it is renewable [5,6]. Hydrogen can be produced from ethanol using different reforming reactions, including steam reforming of ethanol (SRE), partial oxidation of ethanol (POE), oxidation steam reforming of ethanol (OSRE), and ethanol decomposition (DE). The steam reforming of ethanol has been shown to be the most desirable method of producing hydrogen because it can convert one mole of ethanol to six moles of hydrogen. As such, steam reforming of ethanol had been investigated extensively [7–19]. Recently, the SRE reaction over noble metals such as Rh, Pt, and Pd, and transition metals such as Co and Ni, has been reported. Supported Ni [8–12] and Co [13–16] catalysts showed good activity and selectivity for the SRE reaction, but the key disadvantage clearly was easy deactivation resulting from coke formation on the surface of the catalysts. Among noble metal-based catalysts, Rh proved to be the most active and selective [13,17–19]. Frusteri et al. [13] studied the catalytic performance of Rh, Co, Ni, and Pd metals supported on MgO for a SRE reaction. Among these catalysts, Rh/MgO showed the best performance with regard to both activity and stability. Notably, supports play an important role in catalyst performance pertaining specifically to catalytic reactions. The ceria (CeO2) support showed both higher reducibility and oxygen storage–release capacity, resulting in coke that exhibited easy gasification and prevented catalyst deactivation [20,21]. Furthermore, the interaction of ceria-support and metals show potential for improving the dispersion of metals and preventing the sintering of metals [22]. CeO2 also can improve the water–gas shift reaction (WGS) that leads to a lower CO production and higher H2 yield [23]. Zhang et al. reported that Ir/CeO2 catalysts showed good performance regarding activity and stability for SRE because of a better interaction between the Ir and ceria [24]. Recently, the chemical solution routes including, chemical precipitation, sol–gel, hydrothermal and sono-chemistry approaches have been widely used to fabricate nanocrystals due to the advantages of low temperature and large scale production. A simple reduction/oxidation chemical solution approach carried out at room temperature has been developed by Zhang et al. [25] to synthesize ultrafine SnO2 nanocrystals using NaBH4 as a reducing agent. Zhou et al. [26] showed that the effect of ultrasonic irradiation accelerated the reaction and resulted in obtaining relatively small and uniform nanocrystals. In this work, we aimed to prepare nanocrystal ceria that possess a high surface area. The SRE reaction over the Ir/CeO2 catalyst was investigated with the focus on the conditions of reduction pretreatment and different kinds of CeO2."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Three types of ceria were chosen to prepare the catalyst: commercial [assigned as CeO2(C)] and prepared [using a simple reduction–oxidation method, CeO2(R), and another combined with ultrasonic irradiation, CeO2(U)] ceria. The simple reduction–oxidation method used sodium boron hydride (NaBH4) as the reducing agent. The NaBH4 was gradually added to the aqueous solution of cerium nitrate [Ce(NO3)3·6H2O] and was constantly stirred at room temperature. Then, half of the obtained as-prepared colloid solution was irradiated with 240W of ultrasonic irradiation for 30min (half of the colloid solution was not irradiated) at room temperature. After being filtered and washed with deionized water and ethanol, the product was dried at 60°C overnight to obtain CeO2(U) (irradiated) and CeO2(R) (non-irradiated) supports. The Ir/CeO2 catalyst with Ir loading of 2wt.% was prepared through deposition–precipitation using iridium chloride (IrCl3) as the precursor at 75°C and pH=9 (adjusted with 0.25M Na2CO3). The obtained catalysts were dried at 100°C overnight and then calcined in the air at 400°C for 2h. In order to better understand the effect of activation conditions of the catalyst on the reforming of ethanol, reduction pretreatments at 200 and 400°C (assigned as H2 and H4) were compared."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Iridium loadings on the reduced samples were determined by the atomic-emission technique using an ICP-MS (Perkin–Elmer). The dispersion (D) of iridium on reduced samples was volumetrically determined by dihydrogen chemisorptions at 25°C. BET surface area (S BET) measurements were conducted using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument. The catalysts were pre-outgassed in a vacuum for 3h at 110°C. The surface area was determined from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a MAC Science MXP18 diffractometer with Cu K α 1 radiation (λ =1.5405Å) at 40kV and 30mA. The crystallite sizes of the ceria were estimated using the Scherrer equation. The reduction behavior of the CeO2 supports and Ir/CeO2 catalysts were studied using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). A total of 50mg of the sample was heated in a flow of 10% H2/N2 gas at a flow rate of 10mlmin−1. During TPR, temperature was increased with 7°Cmin−1 from room temperature to 700°C."
4,Catalytic activity measurement,"2.3 Catalytic activity measurement Catalytic activities of Ir/CeO2 catalysts toward the SRE reaction were performed at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed flow reactor. A total of 100mg of catalyst was placed in a 4mm i.d. quartz tubular reactor and held in place by glass wool plugs. The temperature of the reactor was controlled with a heating tape and measured using a thermocouple (1.2mm i.d.) at the center of the reactor bed. The feed of the reactants comprised a gaseous mixture of ethanol (EtOH), H2O and Ar (purity 99.9995%, supplied by a mass flow controller). The composition of reactant mixture (H2O/EtOH/Ar=37/3/60vol.%) was controlled by flow of an Ar stream (22mlmin−1) through a saturator (maintained at 120°C) containing EtOH and H2O. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was maintained at 22,000h−1 and the H2O/EtOH molar ratio was 13 (H2O:EtOH=80:20 by volume). Prior to the reaction, the sample was activated by means of reduction with hydrogen at 200 and 400°C (assigned as H2 and H4) for 3h and compared. The SRE activity was tested stepwise while increasing the temperature from 300 to 500°C. The analysis of the reactants and all the reaction products was carried out online by gas chromatography with columns of Porapak Q and Molecular Sieve 5A used to separate them. Response factors for all products were obtained and the system was calibrated using industry standards before each catalytic test. The evaluation of the SRE activity of all samples depended on the conversion of ethanol (C EtOH), the distribution of products (mol.%), and the yield of hydrogen ( Y H 2 ) per mole ethanol."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of samples,"3.1 Characterization of samples The second column of Table 1 list the surface areas estimated for the prepared CeO2 supports and Ir/CeO2 catalysts. It indicates that the loading of Ir only slightly decreased the surface area of the ceria. Apparently, the surface areas of prepared ceria supports [CeO2(R) and CeO2(U)] are larger than that of the commercial ceria [CeO2(C)]. Both the Ir loading and the dispersion of catalysts are listed in the 3rd and 4th columns of Table 1. The observed deviation from the theoretical weight loading (2wt.%) over Ir/CeO2(C) is significant in the highly dispersed sample but becomes substantial on other two samples. This is attributed to the lack of a surface hydroxyl group on the CeO2(C) that loses Ir in the preparation process, while the prepared ceria supports possess much surface hydroxyl group that is liable to load iridium. Although the surface area of CeO2(R) is larger, the dispersion of Ir/CeO2(R) catalyst is lower. This is attributed to the residue of boron (4.68%) that accumulates on the CeO2(R) support in the reduction–oxidation process. The order of dispersion is: Ir/CeO2(C) (82 and 74% for H2 and H4 samples)>Ir/CeO2(U) (68 and 60%)>Ir/CeO2(R) (42 and 25%). Compared to the dispersion of catalysts under reduction pretreatment, a slightly decreased results for H4 samples are observed. Fig. 1 shows the XRD profiles of CeO2 supports and Ir/CeO2 catalysts. Only CeO2(C) and Ir/CeO2(C) show a well-crystallized CeO2 phase with a fluorite-type structure. Other supports and catalysts indicate an amorphous structure. We chose the CeO2 (111) plane to calculate the crystallite sizes of the ceria by using the Scherrer equation. The average diameter of ceria (lists in 5th column in Table 1) are 2, 3, 14nm for CeO2(R), CeO2(U) and CeO2(C), respectively. No significant diffraction signals of Ir were merged for all Ir/CeO2 catalysts. When the samples were severely reduced with hydrogen at higher temperature (Fig. 1(D)), no sintering phenomena occurred. It is clear that the corresponding Ir particles were highly dispersed on the surface of ceria and were too small to be detected. These results match the measurement of dispersions (particles size less than 4nm that were calculated from the reciprocal of dispersion, see the last column of Table 1). Fig. 2 shows the TPR profiles of CeO2 supports and Ir/CeO2 catalysts. Pure CeO2 presents three reduction peaks around 300–350, 430–580 and 770–800°C. The first two peaks are attributed to the removal of surface capping oxygen ions during the reduction reaction and the last peak is related to the reduction of bulk CeO2 [27,28]. The 2nd peak shows a higher hydrogen consumption of CeO2(U) than the others do due to the reduction of the surface hydroxyl group that accompanies the surface oxygen. The Ir/CeO2 catalysts also exhibit three reduction peaks around 140–180, 200–500 and 630–770°C. The first peak results from the reduction of IrO2 to Ir while the other peaks stem from a reduction of CeO2. Observations of the variation in reduction temperatures show that the presence of Ir causes the partial bulk reduction of CeO2 to be shifted to a lower temperature region over the Ir/CeO2 catalysts. Also, the partial surface reduction of CeO2 shifted to a much lower temperature region, indicating a strong interaction between Ir and CeO2. This demonstrates that the dissociated hydrogen is able to spill over from the Ir to the CeO2 surface and further reduce it at a lower temperature. Compared to the reduction behavior, an interaction between the Ir metal and the CeO2 support is apparent. According to the reduction temperatures, the order of interaction between metal and support is: Ir/CeO2(C)>Ir/CeO2(U)>Ir/CeO2(R)."
7,Catalytic performance on the SRE reaction,"3.2 Catalytic performance on the SRE reaction The catalytic performances of Ir/CeO2 catalysts in the steam reforming of ethanol under different temperatures (T R) are described in Figs. 3–5 . From the distribution of minor C2H4 (<1%) with temperature, we excluded the side-reaction of ethanol dehydration to ethylene. Ethanol conversion and H2 production increased progressively with T R for all samples. Under high conversion distribution, high selectivity to H2 and CO2 was achieved. Complete conversion presented around 450°C for Ir/CeO2(U) (Fig. 4) and Ir/CeO2(C) (Fig. 5) catalysts while only showing 80% conversion around 500°C for the Ir/CeO2(R) (Fig. 3) catalyst. Fig. 3 shows the catalytic performance of Ir/CeO2(R)-H2 and Ir/CeO2(R)-H4 catalysts. The conversion (C EtOH) only achieved 86% for Ir/CeO2(R)-H2 (Fig. 3(A)) and 68% for Ir/CeO2(R)-H4 (Fig. 3(B)) at 500°C. From the product distribution, we know that the initial stage is the dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. With a further increase in temperature for the Ir/CeO2(R)-H4 sample, acetaldehyde is the main product. This means that the required temperature for the decomposition of acetaldehyde (D T) exceeds 400°C which tends to lower the hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 ). According to the analysis of ICP-MS, the amount of boron existing on the Ir/CeO2(R) sample to encase the active Ir, inhibits the decomposition of acetaldehyde and lower the H2 concentration. Clearly, the Ir/CeO2(R) catalyst exhibits less catalytic activity on the SRE reaction. The hydrogen yield for Ir/CeO2(R)-H2 and Ir/CeO2(R)-H4 samples are only 1.5 and 0.75, respectively at 500°C. Fig. 4 compares the effect of the activation conditions of the Ir/CeO2(U) catalyst on the SRE reaction. The ethanol conversion approaches completion for the Ir/CeO2(U)-H2 (Fig. 4(A)) sample at T R =475°C. The Ir/CeO2(U)-H4 (Fig. 4(B)) sample approaches completion at 450°C while slightly decreasing above this temperature. This may be attributed to the agglomeration of Ir under a high temperature reduction that deactivates the activity of the Ir/CeO2(U)-H4 catalyst under high T R. Additional evidence will be discussed further on. At a lower temperature (<375°C), the main reactions of the Ir/CeO2(U) catalyst were an ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde and hydrogen, and then acetaldehyde decomposition into methane and CO. (1) C 2 H 5 OH → CH 3 CHO + H 2 (2) CH 3 CHO → CH 4 + CO At a higher temperature (>375°C), the increase of CO2 accompanied the decrease of CO. This indicated that the water–gas shift reaction (WGSR) had occurred. (3) CO + H 2 O → H 2 + CO 2 When the T R was raised to 450°C, the concentration of CH4 gradually decreased; this indicated dehydrogenation from methane and steam reforming of coke from Ir/CeO2 catalysts. Since there was no remarkable carbon deposition observed with the used catalyst, the gasification of coke via the oxygen storage–release capacity of the CeO2 support [7,19,29] may have occurred. (4) CH 4 → 2 H 2 + C (5) C + H 2 O → H 2 + CO A comparison of the amounts of C2 (CH3CHO) and C3 (CH3COCH3) product distribution with the Y H 2 on Ir/CeO2(U)-H2 sample showed the concentration of hydrogen increasing abruptly as the temperature rose above 450°C; the concentration of both C2 and C3 products decreased gradually. This phenomenon indicates that the steam reforming of acetaldehyde and acetone [30] are thermodynamically feasible at high temperatures. (6) CH 3 CHO + 3 H 2 O → 5 H 2 + 2 CO 2 (7) CH 3 COCH 3 + 5 H 2 O → 8 H 2 + 3 CO 2 Fig. 5 compares the effect of activation conditions of the Ir/CeO2(C) catalyst on the SRE reaction. The ethanol conversion approaches completion for both the Ir/CeO2(C)-H2 (Fig. 5(A)) and Ir/CeO2(C)-H4 [Fig. 5(B)] samples at T R =425°C, whereas the H2 concentration is lower. Acetone is the main factor initiating a lower yield of hydrogen at temperatures lower than 400°C. The acetaldehyde can be transformed in different ways: decomposition to methane and carbon monoxide (Eq. (2)) or via aldol condensation, dehydrogenation, and decarboxylation to produce acetone [24,31]. (8) 2 C 2 H 5 OH → CH 3 COCH 3 + CO + H 2 In observing the methane and acetone distribution from the Ir/CeO2(U) and Ir/CeO2(C) samples, it is apparent that the competition reactions of decomposition and condensation do exist. According to the measurement of dispersion, the particle size of Ir plays an important role. When the particle size of Ir is lower than 1.5nm, the condensation of acetaldehyde is preferred. Conversely, when the particle size of Ir is higher than 1.5nm, the decomposition of acetaldehyde is preferred. As the temperature exceeded 425°C, the concentration of hydrogen increased abruptly. This also indicated that the steam reforming of acetone (Eq. (7)) is thermodynamically feasible for the Ir/CeO2(C) catalyst at high temperature. Fig. 6 summarizes the effect of temperature of Ir/CeO2 catalysts C EtOH (Fig. 6(A)) and Y H 2 (Fig. 6(B)). The results confirm that the activity of Ir/CeO2(U) and Ir/CeO2(C) catalysts are better than Ir/CeO2(R). Since the sintering phenomena is less, the influence of reduction pretreatment on the catalytic activities was only evident in the Ir/CeO2(U)-H4 sample. The T R is lower and the Y H 2 was higher for Ir/CeO2(U) and Ir/CeO2(C) catalysts. Not only does the high dispersion of both the catalysts present but also the absence of impurities (e.g., boron) interfered with the catalytic activities. On the other hand, it is the presence of boron on the Ir/CeO2(R) sample which encases the active Ir that inhibited the catalytic activity. Under H2O/EtOH molar ratio of 13 and 22,000h−1 GHSV for both Ir/CeO2(C)-H2 and Ir/CeO2(C)-H4 catalysts, the Y H 2 approached 5.3 under 475°C and only minor CO (<2%) was detected. Under the same conditions, the Y H 2 approached 5.3 and 4.0 for the Ir/CeO2(U)-H2 and Ir/CeO2(U)-H4 catalysts, respectively."
8,Conclusion,A series of ethanol reforming catalysts have been developed which present good catalytic activities. The following conclusions have been made as follows: (1) The presence of boron on the Ir/CeO2(R) sample inhibits catalytic activity. (2) The high dispersion and lack of impurities in Ir/CeO2(U) and Ir/CeO2(C) catalysts make them active and selective for hydrogen production by steam reforming of ethanol. (3) The ethanol conversion approaches completion around 450°C via reduction pretreatment for Ir/CeO2(U) and Ir/CeO2(C) samples. The hydrogen yield exceeds 5.0 with only slightly less distribution of CO and CH4 (<2%).
