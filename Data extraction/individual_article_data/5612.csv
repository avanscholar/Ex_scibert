0,Introduction,"By definition, hydrogels are three-dimensional configuration polymeric networks that swell in water without losing their structural integrity and capacity to absorb high amounts of water saline, or biological fluids [1–4]. Conforming to their high potential in several fields of medical research [5] such as drug delivery systems [6], Scaffold materials for cell and tissue engineering [7–9], coating [10], packers in oil and gas recovery [11], the increasing interest in hydrogel production have been justified. Hydrogel structures can be fabricated by natural sources or artificial sources [12]. There is a diversity of synthetic and natural polymers which can be utilized to synthesize hydrogel networks. These substrates can be obtained by methods such as physical gelation, chemical cross-linking, or self-assembly [13]. The pH of responsive physically or chemically crosslinked hydrogels has been investigated as a matrix of controlled drug delivery because of their appreciable diffusion properties that are regulated by their pH-dependent swelling behavior [14]. Anionic linear polysaccharide derived from residues mannuronic and guluronic acid is alginate [15] which has been applied for biomedical applications due to its high biocompatibility [16], low toxicity, excellent hydrophilic like Ca2+ [9,16,17]. Sodium alginate (SA) along with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polymers has been investigated as either main or additional component due to its high water swelling ability in different applications such as wound healing, wound dressing, drug delivery [18,19]. Due to the hydroxyl groups, PVA is soluble in water and easily degradable in the environment [20]. Therefore, PVA is one of the best synthetic polymers for hydrogel studies; which can be used as a non-toxic biological glue for scaffold bonding, with perfect biocompatibility. This synthetic polymer itself is highly elastic and is widely used in the field of biomedicine, such as cartilage tissue engineering, cell carrier, and drug delivery system [21]. Given this, the combination of PVA with SA causes the construction of low-cost polymeric materials, with excellent and stable physical properties against biological processes [22], considering to this issue, the polymer network structure can be tailored by using the cross-linker [23]. Cross-linking interactions can be considered as a solution for biomaterial limitations. Calcium chloride is one of the most commonly used cross-linking agents for alginate. Until now, cross-linking via CaCl2 is not a controlled process due to its high solubility in aqueous solutions [24–26]. Cross-linking processes impede dispersal and alter the polymer network topology. In addition, cross-linking depends on the concentration of alginate and CaCl2 [24,27,28]. Silk fibroin (SF) is a fibrillar protein derived from the silkworm cocoon. The studies have been shown that the use of SF in the hydrogel networks can improve their mechanical properties [29], elastic recovery, and biocompatibility [30]. In other words, materials can be mixed with SF, such as drug carriers. These substrates demonstrated the ability to stabilize drugs through endogenous parameters, such as crystallinity [31–33]. The composition of metal hydroxide nanorods in the hydrogel network gives rise to various functions including strengthening of physical, chemical, thermal, and mechanical properties by surface functional groups for cross-linking of polymeric hydrogels [34,35]. In this regard, the role of magnesium hydroxide as a new antimicrobial agent is discussed, and Mg(OH)2 nanorods have been considered as a low-cost, green agent widespread applications in foods, heavy metal removal, remarkable environmental compatibility, appreciable thermal stability [36,37], flame retardancy and biomedicine. Wound healing involves inflammation, cellular proliferation, and tissue repair. This process requires strong cell function, growth factors, and extracellular signals [38–40]. An excellent wound dressing is needed to accelerate skin healing [41,42]. Hydrogels, films, fibers, or foams made of natural polymers, such as chitosan [43], collagen, hyaluronic acid, alginate, or synthetic polymers including PVA, and Poly(acrylic acid) can be used for modern wound dressings [44–47]. Hydrogels with the antibacterial substances have recently received more attention because of their greater protection against threatening infections. In recent developments due to unique physicochemical and functional properties of the biopolymer-based composites, such as biocompatibility, and moisture retention, antimicrobial activity, perfect absorption, and non-cytotoxic properties, the possibility of hydrogel-based wound dressing is provided [48,49]. In general, an ideal wound dressing should create a moist environment, prevent secondary infections, and stimulate tissue regeneration. One of the most common systems for managing acute to chronic wounds is hydrogels, which are made up of hydrophilic polymers. This feature increases collagenase production and thus increases the amount of moisture in the necrotic wound [50]. Also, the biocompatibility of hydrogels with antibacterial material creates a suitable substrate for the development of strong antimicrobial agents [51,52]. In this study, a novel antibacterial hydrogel with low cost, effective and safe was developed. The hydrogel dressings were prepared in a facile approach by mixing PVA, SA, and CaCl2 solution as a cross-linking agent. Compared to previous published scientific articles [53,54], this work has better mechanical and antibacterial properties. In this study, the survival rate of the cells on the first and second day was 95% and 87%, respectively, and also has a low hemolysis effect (less than 8%), which can be considered as one of the advantages of new nanobiocomposite. The effects of SA and PVA with SF and Mg(OH)2 on characteristics of gel scaffolds, including morphology, hemolysis, mechanical properties, and antibacterial activities were investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,General,"2.1 General In these experiments, all the reagents, chemical compounds, and solvents such as PVA (CAS No. 9002-89-5, Mw: 9000–10,000, 80% hydrolyzed), SA (CAS No. 9005-38-30), CaCl2·2H2O (CAS No. 10035-04-8, Mw: 147.01), NaHCO3 (CAS No. 144-55-8), and LiBr (CAS No. 7550-35-8) were purchased with high purities from Merck, and Sigma-Aldrich, except the silkworm cocoons which were obtained from local suppliers. Dialysis tubing cellulose membrane (14,000 Da) provided from Sigma-Aldrich chemical co. all other chemicals were analytical grade and used directly. As well as, the materials used for the synthesis of Mg(OH)2 nanorods included magnesium oxide (MgO, CAS No. 1309-48-4) and 2-propanol (CAS No. 67-63-0) which were manufactured by Merck Co. Milli-Q ultra-pure water was also used. FT-IR spectra were taken using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy on a (Shimadzu IR-470 spectrometer, Japan) by the method of KBr pellets. The morphology and structure of cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel and cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite was examined with a Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) (ZEISS-Sigma VP model, Germany). Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was done by using a Numerix DXP-X10P, France. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG analysis) was provided under the argon atmosphere by Bahr-STA 504, Germany. The absorbance of each sample was admeasured at 590 nm using a microplate reader (STAT FAX 2100, BioTek, Winooski, USA) to evaluate cell toxicity, cell viability, determining blood compatibility and antimicrobial activity. A universal test machine (SANTAM, STM-20 model, Iran) was used to calculate the elongation, strength, toughness, and tensile modulus of synthesized scaffolds. The obtained results and data by spectroscopic and analytical experiments have confirmed the synthesis of cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel and its combination with SF and Mg(OH)2 nanorods as new antibacterial nanocomposite. 2.1.1 Preparation of cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel In this study, cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel was prepared according to the previous method [55]. Briefly, to prepare 4 wt% solutions, SA and PVA powders were separately dissolved in distilled water. This solution was blended according to 90% v/v of SA and 10% PVA. Then it was stirred continuously at 50 °C with magnetic stirring for 10 min until a clear solution was obtained. Next, CaCl2 solution (1 wt%) was added to the mixture to pre-crosslink the SA suspension. The mixture was then manually mixed and 1 mL of the mixture cast into the microplate. The sample was placed into the refrigerator (−70 °C) for 24 h. Then, it was freeze-dried and stored in a dry place. 2.1.2 Extraction of SF Among the different methods for the extraction of SF, two methods of extracting SFs from animals and plants have become the main methods. Given the previous studies [56,57] SF aqueous solutions have been prepared from cocoons. In general, silk regeneration is a three-step process, including degumming, rehydration, and dialysis. Firstly, 500 mL of distilled water was poured to boil. Before boiling, a distinctive amount of NaHCO3 (1.06 g) was added to the distilled water. The small pieces of silkworm cocoons were added to the boiling water and kept under the stirring condition for 2 h. After the mentioned time, the strings of cocoons were washed several times with distilled water and set for one night in order to dry completely. In the dehydration step, the degummed fibers were dissolved in LiBr solution (9.3 M) at 60 °C for 2 h to rehydration of the proteins. Finally, the solution was dialyzed against distilled water for at least two days at room temperature using a dialysis membrane. After 2 days, the bag was removed and the SF solution was kept in the refrigerator for the next synthetic steps. 2.1.3 Preparation of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF hydrogel In this step cross-linked SA-PVA/SF hydrogel was prepared with dissolving 0.5 mL cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel and 0.5 mL extracted SF solution at room temperature for 5 min. Then, the mixture was cast into the microplate. The hydrogels were then subjected to freeze at −70 °C for 24 h. The sample was then freeze-dried and stored in a dry place for the rest of the steps. 2.1.4 Synthesis of Mg(OH)2 nanorods Mg(OH)2 nanorods were obtained by using Mg powder and ethylene diamine and distilled water. Ethylenediamine was used as a solvent. According to the previous report [58], some Mg powder was poured into an autoclave (100 mL). Then, 70% of autoclave filled with 5 mL of distilled water and ethylenediamine. It was stored at 180 °C for 2 h. After the mentioned time, the white powder was cooled at room temperature. Then it was washed with distilled water to remove excess ethylenediamine. The final product was dried at 100 °C and stored in a vial for later use. 2.1.5 Modification of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite For the first time, cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel was blended with antibacterial Mg(OH)2 nanorods in this work. For the preparation of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite, 0.5 mL of SF was mixed with 0.5 cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel. 0.3 wt% of nanorods was completely powdered and added to the mixture. Afterward, the suspension was placed in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min. Then, the suspension was poured into the microplate. The sample was placed into the refrigerator (−70 °C) for 24 h. After the mentioned time, the substrate freeze-dried for 48 h and it was kept in a dry place. 2.1.6 Cell viability and biocompatibility assay MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to measure the toxicity, biocompatibility, and cell viability of the cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite. For this purpose, Hu02 cells were cultured at 1 × 105 cell/well in 96-well plate on the synthesized scaffold under the optimal conditions (temperature 37 °C, 5% CO2 in the humidified incubator) for 1 and 2 days. In the following, the proliferation rate of them was contrasted with those of the cells cultured in a culture plate, which was considered as a positive control. Then, the 5 mg/mL MTT in PBS solution was freshly prepared and the cells were treated with 10 μL of this solution at 37 °C for 4 h. Next, the media with MTT solution was then tabernacled with 2-propanol at 100 μL/well. Plates were shaken moderately to solubilize the formazan crystals [59–61]. The negative control was provided with supplemented RPMI without scaffold and cells in each well. The absorbance of each well was admeasured at 590 nm using a microplate reader. The percentage of toxicity was obtained by the following eq. (1). (1) Toxicity % = 1 − mean OD of sample mean OD of control × 100 Cell viability was also calculated by Eq. (2). (2) Cell viability % = 100 % − Toxicity % 2.1.7 Blood compatibility assay The hemolytic assay was used to specify the blood compatibility of the cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite on human red blood cells (RBCs). For this purpose, a voluntary consent form was first filled out by a volunteer and fresh blood samples were taken. A suspension of human RBS at a concentration of 15% (v/v) was prepared in 0.9% NaCl solution. Then, in each well of 96-well plate, a piece of cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel, and cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite with determined dimensions (4 mm × 4 mm) was placed and 100 μL of suspension made, added to their surface. Triton X-100 (1%), which causes 100% lysis of RBCs, was used as a positive control and sterile 0.9% NaCl solution as a negative control. All of these steps were repeated in three wells for each treatment [62–64]. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min. Eventually, 150 μL of the supernatant was transferred to a new 96-well plate and its absorbance at 414 nm was obtained using a microplate reader and then the hemolysis percentage of the scaffolds was calculated using the following Eq. (3). (3) Hemolysis % = mean OD of sample − mean OD of negative sample mean OD of positive control − mean OD of negative control × 100 2.1.8 Anti-biofilm assay In order to determine the antimicrobial activity of the scaffolds a tissue culture plate (TCP), and anti-biofilm essay with some of the modifications were performed [65]. For this purpose, the pieces (1 cm2) of the cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel, and cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite, and a polystyrene piece as control were sterilized in 70% ethanol aqueous solution and dried up at 37 °C sterilized incubator. Next, these samples were introduced in three sterilized tubes containing selected bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) at a concentration of 107 CFU/mL in the NB culture medium. The tubes were incubated in a shaker incubator with a shaking speed of 150 rpm at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, samples and polystyrene pieces were removed from the tubes and were washed twice by PBS for anti-biofilm assay. To investigate the anti-biofilm properties, the samples and polystyrene pieces were stained by a 0.1% crystal violet solution for 5 min. Next, in order to dissociate the bacteria from the samples of the surface, these components were washed by acetic acid solution (33%). Eventually, the absorbance of the resulting solution was then measured using a microplate reader at 570 nm. This test was repeated three times. 2.1.9 Statistical analysis All antibiofilm and toxicity results are reported as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed by a t-test by SPSS Statistics 22.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). The p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant [66]."
3,Result and discussion,"In this research, due to the importance of biocompatibility of biodegradable and non-toxic and antibacterial treatment materials, cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite was used as a substrate with the above mentioned characteristics. As can be seen in Fig. 1 , the nanobiocomposite was fabricated in 3 synthesis steps. First, the SA solution was mixed with a PVA solution; then, CaCl2 was added as a cross-linking agent. In the second step, the extracted SF was mixed with the obtained cross-linked SA-PVA/SF hydrogel. Afterward, in the final step, Mg(OH)2 nanorods were added as an antibacterial agent. In addition to the above descriptions, its structural features were well investigated. The characteristics of the nature of single and double bonds, especially new functional groups at each step were determined by FT-IR spectra. EDX was used to analyze the structure and chemical properties of the sample. This method provides the ability to describe the elements in the sample. Also, by using the mapping, the elements scattering in the sample are determined. The morphological analysis and porous structure of cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel, cross-linked SA-PVA/SF hydrogel, and cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite, were characterized by using FE-SEM images. TG analysis was used to investigate the thermogravimetric behavior and thermal stability of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite and to study the weight loss temperature and estimate the lifespan of the sample against heat. These characteristics are discussed below."
4,Characterization of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite,"3.1 Characterization of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite 3.1.1 FT-IR analysis FTIR spectroscopy was used to characterize cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel, cross-linked SA-PVA/SF hydrogel, and cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite. (Fig. 2a) shows the IR spectrum of cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel. The broadband which are displayed at 3200 to 3600 cm−1 (3355.90 cm−1), was characterized for the stretching vibration of OH bands and also the intermolecular hydrogen bands of polysaccharide, alginate [55]. The two absorption bands at 2926 cm−1 and 2876 cm−1 were attributed to the CH symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations mode [67]. Two absorption bands in 1421 cm−1 and 1608 cm−1 were assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of the COO− group, respectively [68]. (Fig. 2b) is related to the cross-linked SA-PVA/SF hydrogel. Strong absorption band on the FT-IR spectrum (Fig. 2b) of SF was observed for amide I, amide II and amide III at about 1655 cm−1, 1539 cm−1, and 1238 cm−1, respectively. Amide I band mainly is related to the (C=O) stretching and low participation from the (NH) in-plane bending vibration. Amide II band mainly is due to the (NH) distortion and little stretching vibrations of the (CN). Also, the amide III band is due to the major subscription stems from the (NH) vibration and small stretching vibrations of the (CN) [69]. The band at 2932 cm−1 was related to the symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching vibrations of the CH band [67], and the band at 3200 cm−1 to 3600 cm−1 (3309 cm−1) was related to the OH stretching vibrations specified in the hydrogel combination with the SF [55]. The FT-IR spectrum of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite is indicated in Fig. 2c. As could be seen, an absorption around 423 cm−1 was ascribed to the MgO stretching vibration in Mg(OH)2 nanorods. An absorption band at 3533 cm−1 was attributed to the OH stretching vibration mode in the Mg(OH)2 structure [70]. There are two consecutive sharp absorption bands at 1539 cm−1 and 1655 cm−1 which were related to the symmetrical and asymmetric vibration modes of COO− functional group in the structure of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF hydrogel. Also in addition to the vibrations of COO− functional group, absorption bands at 1230 cm−1, 1545 cm−1, and 1658 cm−1 could be related to the amide functional group of SF. SF is a semi-crystalline polypeptide that consists of two structures: random coil and β-sheet crystal. The β-sheet structure is formed by the hydrogen bonding between NH and CO groups of SF chains [71]. The peaks at 1539 cm−1 and 1655 cm−1 represents the β-sheet and random coil conformation of SF chains, respectively. These bands shifted to 1546 and 1658 cm−1 after the Mg(OH)2 enter the beads. The absorption band at 2923 cm−1 which was related to symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching vibrations of the CH bond, could be seen in the composition of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite. In the cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite, a broad absorption band at 3409 cm−1 belongs to the OH group [68]. 3.1.2 EDX analysis The (EDX) analysis was used to investigate the elements of the prepared hydrogel. EDX spectrum (Fig. 3 ) indicated the presence of the elements C, O, N, Mg, and Ca, in the cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite, which was derived from the carboxyl group of alginate and SF and Mg(OH)2 nanorods and the cross-linking agent (CaCl2), respectively. The presence of nitrogen signal in the EDX spectrum of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite indicates the successful conjugation of SF with cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel. A sharp band of magnesium was found in the spectrum can be attributed to the Mg(OH)2 nanorod. The band of Ca is correlated to the cross-linking agent. Moreover, the mapping images (Fig. 4 ) showed a homogenous distribution form of related elements throughout the composite hydrogels. 3.1.3 FE-SEM images FE-SEM images were used to evaluate the morphology of freeze-dried hydrogel scaffolds. According to the observed FE-SEM images (Fig. 5a), the structure of the mesoporous cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel was shown. With the removal of water the polymer network during the freeze-drying, a lot of pores are created. It can be said that through these pores it is possible to exchange gas, nutrients, and enough space for the molecules to circulate. In (Fig. 5b), SF is added to the cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel and the results show that the morphology of the hydrogel has changed and incorporated SF. In (Fig. 5c,d), rod-shaped nanoparticles can be seen on the substrate surface with different sizes, indicating the successful synthesis of magnesium hydroxide nanorods in the cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite. 3.1.4 TGA analysis (Fig. 6 ) shows the TGA analysis thermogram of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite. In order to evaluate the weight percentages of scaffolds in the thermal state, their thermal properties were investigated. The TGA analysis was carried out under the argon atmosphere from 50 °C to 600 °C with a rate of 10 °C/min. The curve of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite shows the first weight loss at around (60 °C–160 °C) due to the evaporation of adsorbed water. The second weight loss of (270 °C–390 °C) was related to the breakdown of amino acid side chains, the cleavage of the SF peptide bonds, as well as the reduction in SA-PVA weight [55,72]. After this extensive mass reduction, the mass of nanocomposite became stable and did not change."
5,Bio-application of designed cross-linked SA-PVA/SF hydrogel,
6,Biocompatibility assay result,"4.1 Biocompatibility assay result Toxicity in tissue engineering and wound healing scaffolds should be at an optimum level, therefore, MTT assay was used to determine the toxicity of synthesized scaffold. The percentage of viability of Hu02 cells treated by scaffolds is shown in (Fig. 7a). Results are the average of 3 independent experiments. The results showed that the viability of the Hu02 cells in the vicinity of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite, after one and two days was 95% and 87%, respectively, while that for the untreated cells (control group) was 99.31% and 97.65%, respectively. Cisplatin was also used as a positive control, killed more than 96% of cells after 2 days at a concentration of 1 μg/mL (Fig. 7a). Statistical analysis indicated that there was no significant difference between cell viability on day 1 and day 2 (p > .05). These analyses also revealed that toxicity of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite was significantly higher compared to non-treated states on the third and seventh days (p ≤ .05). The picture of micro-plate wells from MTT assay on Hu02 cell line is also shown in Fig. 7b. Fig. 8 also shows the inverted microscopic pictures of untreated Hu02 cell, cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite treatment, and cisplatin treatment. According to many studies, SA-based hydrogels are highly biocompatible and therefore widely used as scaffolds in tissue engineering and wound healing. For example, SA/PVA/nano ZnO composite nanofibers have been used for antibacterial wound dressing [73]. The biomimetic SF/SA composite scaffold has also been used for soft tissue engineering [74]. In this study, SA hydrogel was first synthesized and then PVA and SF were added to improve its biological, physical, and mechanical properties. Finally, after the addition of Mg(OH)2 nanorods due to increased antimicrobial properties, cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite was synthesized. However, the addition of these nanorods caused partial toxicity for human cells [75] and decreased their viability. In a study, Meng et al. showed that Mg(OH)2 nanorods at a concentration of 200 μg/mL significantly inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) [75]. In the present study, MTT assay results showed that the toxicity of Mg(OH)2 nanorods in the synthesized scaffold was not high, and thus the cell viability in the presence of scaffold was not significantly reduced compared to the control group and this scaffold is considered to be biocompatible overall. In our study, the survival rate of the cells on the first and second day was 95% and 87%, respectively. Although 87% of cells viability after 2 days could be acceptable [62], we speculate that 13% toxicity may be due to excessive production of waste in the culture medium or due to the release of magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles. One can guess that, although adding magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles can improve the antimicrobial properties of scaffolding, it also increases toxicity. However, It can be said that in in vivo studies the materials could be changed every two days when applying onto wounds to avoid further toxicity towards the indispensable cells for tissue granulation and re-epithelization."
7,Hemolytic assay result,"4.2 Hemolytic assay result One of the most important prerequisites for wound healing is the compatibility of the prepared wound dresser with erythrocytes [76]. Therefore, the hemolysis ability of synthesized scaffolds, was evaluated by the hemolytic assay on human RBCs. The results of this test showed that the hemolytic effects of the synthesized scaffold were 7.25%. According to recent studies by Tamer et al. hemolytic activity below 5% is acceptable for a biomaterial as wound dressing [77,78]. Zhou et al. showed that magnesium hydroxide nanorods have a mild hemolytic potential [79]. Overall, the data from this test, demonstrated that cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite is a scaffold with some hemolytic activity which could be due to magnesium hydroxide nanorods. One can guess that by reducing the nanoparticle concentration, the hemolysis percentage of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite is also reduced. (Fig. 9 ) presented the hemolysis percentage of cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel and cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite as a histogram. 0.9% NaCl solution was used as negative control and Triton x-100 detergent was used as a positive control, which lysed almost all red blood cells. It is also worth noting that these results are the average of three separate experiments."
8,Inhibition of anti-biofilm activity,"4.3 Inhibition of anti-biofilm activity After the incubation of pieces in bacteria media at mentioned conditions, the bacterial biofilm was grown on the surface of fragments. The scaffolds and polystyrene pieces were stained by 0.1% crystal violet solution and after dissociation of the bacteria from the samples surface, the absorbance of the resulting solution was then measured at 570 nm in the 96 micro-well plates. Many studies confirm the antibacterial activity of Mg(OH)2 nanoparticles [54], and alginate hydrogels [80]. Therefore, the addition of these nanorods to the cross-linked SA-PVA/SF hydrogel matrix increased its antimicrobial activity. The anti-biofilm assay result showed that our scaffold can inhibit P. aeruginosa biofilm formation on itself surface. (Fig. 10 ) shows the absorption rate of the solution obtained by washing the biofilms from the scaffolds pieces. Based on statistical analysis, cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite showed significantly anti-biofilm activity than polystyrene and cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel pieces (p < .05)."
9,Mechanical properties,
10,Tensile test,"5.1 Tensile test In order to calculate the elongation, toughness, strength, and tensile modulus of the synthesized scaffolds, the method performed by Golafshan et al. [81] was used and tensile properties were obtained for the cross-linked SA-PVA hydrogel, cross-linked SA-PVA/SF hydrogel, and cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite. To do this, a universal testing machine was used with a load cell capacity of 10 N, and a rate of 2 mm/min and the uniaxial tensile test was performed at room temperature and under humid conditions. According to this method, the specimens were cut into rectangles with an approximate dimension of 10 mm × 30 mm × 500 μm and soaked in PBS solution (pH = 7.4) for 2 h. Finally, using the STM controller software, the stress-strain curve was depicted and the mechanical properties of the scaffolds were obtained. It should be noted that the tensile test was repeated five times for each specimen and the mean results were reported. The hardness of the materials used in the manufacture of tissue engineering and wound healing scaffolds is one of the most influential factors in cell behavior, including adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Therefore, many hydrogels are not used in these areas [82]. The most important weakness of hydrogels in wound healing is poor mechanical strength. In many studies, combining nanomaterials with hydrogel matrices has been used to solve this problem and increase their stability [81]. One of the major problems with PVA based hydrogels is the dramatic reduction of its mechanical properties by the addition of SA. In fact, as the amount of SA increases, Young's modulus, elongation at break, and maximum tensile strength decrease, the causes of which are discussed in various articles [22,67]. In this study, first by combining SF with SA/PVA hydrogel, the mechanical properties of the hydrogel, which were reduced due to the presence of alginate, were largely offset and were dramatically increased, so that the elongation to failure, toughness, strength and elastic modulus increased from 152% to 197%, from 149 MPa to 352 MPa, from 237 MPa to 449 MPa, and from 342 MPa to 978 MPa, respectively. The addition of Mg(OH)2 nanorods, the formation of cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite, and also increased the mechanical properties, so that the toughness, strength and elastic modulus increased from 352 MPa to 403 MPa, from 449 MPa to 511 MPa, and from 978 MPa to 1025 MPa, respectively. This may be due to the effective interaction between the polymer matrix and the nanorods. In contrast, with the addition of Mg(OH)2 nanorods, the amount of elongation decreased from 197% to 193%, which could be due to the agglomeration of these nanorods, resulting in poor interaction between them and cross-linked SA-PVA/SF hydrogel. The results of the tensile test on the scaffolds are shown in Table 1 . Comparative diagrams of these values are also plotted in (Figs. 11–14 ). Overall, it is anticipated that the addition of SF and then Mg(OH)2 nanorods can improve the properties of synthesized hydrogel homeostasis and thereby improve wound site bleeding control. By comparing the mechanical properties of the synthesized scaffold in this study with other Hydrogel-PVA based scaffolds in other studies, its superiority is evident. In Table 2 , the mechanical properties of some of the scaffolds synthesized in other studies are visible. It should be noted that the mechanical properties of these scaffolds are in the optimum state with the most value."
11,Conclusions,"In this work, cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite was developed using natural SA biopolymer and PVA synthetic polymer, SF as a scaffold, and Mg(OH)2 antibacterial nanorods. The structural properties of this designed nanobiocomposite were determined based on various analyses including FT-IR, EDX, FE-SEM, and TG. The presence of functional groups was confirmed by FT-IR analysis. At each synthesis step, the structure and morphology of the obtained product were investigated, and the mesoporous structure was observed for the cross-linked SA-PVA/SF/Mg(OH)2 nanobiocomposite, as well as the nanorods were observed on the structure of nanobiocomposite. In addition to the mentioned structural properties, the biological properties of the scaffolds were evaluated using MTT and hemolytic assay studies. Its hemolytic effect was less than 8% and about 92% of cells survived. For the evaluation of antibacterial activity, inhibition of anti-biofilm activity was employed and it was determined that the mentioned nanobiocomposite was a potential bacterial killer. Also, the results from mechanical tests showed that the nanobiocomposite has significant mechanical strength. Finally, according to its stated mechanical and biological properties, this composite can be used as a very suitable wound healing agent for patients with a diabetic foot. Improving the wounds of these patients is one of the biggest challenges in the world. Important factors, such as peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy, and impaired immune response through neutrophil dysfunction, prevent the healing of diabetic wounds and expose them to infectious and microbes [83]. The use of this scaffold, due to its antimicrobial properties, prevents the infection from progressing and gradually heals the wound."
