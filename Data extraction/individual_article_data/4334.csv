0,Introduction,"The environmental issues that have raised due to the wasteful use of fossil fuels and the foreseen depletion of oil reserves have led to intensive research and technology development for the utilization of various biomass types as alternative source of fuels and high added value chemicals. The lignocellulosic biomass which originates mainly from forest and agricultural residues is considered as one of the most promising renewable sources. It consists mainly of three structural components, the two carbohydrates cellulose (30–50%) and hemicellulose (20–40%) and the phenolic polymer lignin (15–25%). Cellulose is a crystalline polysaccharide consisting of d-glucose molecules which are linearly connected with β(1→4) glycosidic linkages. Hemicellulose is a polysaccharide with amorphous structure and consists of C5 (mainly xylose) and C6 sugar molecules while lignin is a complex polymer of aromatic alcohols, such as p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol [1,2]. The lignocellulosic biomass is the only renewable source that can be converted to liquid, gaseous and solid fuels via biological (anaerobic digestion, enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation) and thermochemical processes (combustion, gasification, pyrolysis and liquefaction) [3]. The liquid fuels that derive from lignocellulosic biomass have been recognized as the second generation biofuels (the fatty acid methylesters-biodiesel from vegetable oils and the bioethanol from sugar crops being the first generation biofuels) [4,5] and comprise the so-called “green” gasoline and diesel produced via the Biomass-to-Liquid (BtL) process [6], the cellulosic bioethanol produced via enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose and microbial fermentation of the formed glucose [7,8], and the gasoline/diesel that can be produced via co-processing of a deoxygenated biomass fast pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) with petroleum fractions (gas-oil) in typical fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) refinery processes [9,10]. In addition, the lignocellulosic biomass can be converted to a whole spectrum of platform chemicals with different functionalities and properties, such as furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), levulinic acid, via a series of cascade catalytic reactions (dehydration, condensation, hydrogenation, etc.) of the C5 and C6 sugars derived from the hydrolysis of the hemicellulose and cellulose respectively [11–14]. Cellulose hydrolysis toward glucose can be performed by the use of either relatively high concentration (ca. 30%) mineral acid (i.e. HCl, H2SO4) aqueous solutions at low reaction temperatures (ca. <100°C) or dilute acid solutions (ca. <5%) at higher temperatures (ca. >120°C) [15,16]. In the latter case, sugar (glucose) degradation products, such as acids and humins are formed, due to dehydration reactions at the increased reaction temperatures. However, the replacement of these strong acids with solid acidic catalysts (such as zeolites, solid superacids, sulphonated carbon nanostructures, sulphated zirconia) has been a subject of intensive research over the last 15 years [17–23] aiming at a more “green” and sustainable biomass utilization concept. The main advantages of using solid acid catalysts are their low corrosivity and the ability to be recovered, regenerated and re-used [24,25]. A current topic of high interest is the one-pot/direct transformation of cellulose into sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, xylitol, arabinitol, glycerol via combined hydrolysis/hydrogenolysis reactions [23,26,27]. In this case, bifunctional catalytic systems are required, comprising of an acidic component to induce the initial cellulose hydrolysis to glucose and the metallic component to catalyze the hydrogenation of glucose as well as the hydrogenolysis of glucose oligomers. Typical examples of such systems could be noble metals (e.g. Ru, Pt, Ir, Rh) supported on solid acid materials (such as zeolites, oxidized carbons, CNTs, γ-Al2O3), which could also involve the use of dilute mineral acids or heteropoly acids to facilitate cellulose hydrolysis [28–32]. It was also suggested that even the H+ produced by water dissociation under hydrothermal autoclave conditions at temperatures higher than ca. 200°C can initiate cellulose hydrolysis toward glucose units which are then hydrogenated toward sugar alcohols on supported noble metal catalysts [33]. A number of studies have also shown the ability of noble metals (i.e. Ru, Pt) to generate H+ ions in situ via dissociative adsorption of H2 or H2O, thus facilitating both cellulose hydrolysis to glucose and subsequent hydrogenation to sugar alcohols, without the need of using a stronger acid (solid or liquid) [26,34,35]. In order to better understand the direct conversion of cellulose to sugar alcohols, the investigation of glucose hydrogenation and/or hydrogenolysis to sugar alcohols is necessary. A number of studies have focused on this reaction testing various catalytic systems and reaction parameter [36,37]. The main product of glucose hydrogenation under relatively mild temperature and time conditions and by the use of typical hydrogenation catalysts is sorbitol. Sorbitol is an important commodity chemical, which is used on an industrial scale for the production of vitamin C synthesis [38], as a sweetener replacing sugar in food products, in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and other products and applications [39]. More recently, sorbitol has been considered as a platform molecule for the production of high added value chemicals and products, such as isosorbide, 1,4-sorbitan, glycols [40], lactic acid and more recently H2 for fuel cells [41] and C5–6 hydrocarbons [42]. Even though sorbitol can be isolated from fruits, on an industrial scale the production of sorbitol can be accomplished via catalytic hydrogenation of d-glucose. Catalysts based on Raney Ni have attracted a lot of interest for this process due mainly to its low cost and high activity [43,44]. To further increase the activity, promoted nickel catalysts, using metal dopants such as chromium, phosphorus, molybdenum, tungsten, iron and tin, have been also studied [45–48]. However, the Raney Ni type of catalysts can be deactivated due to loss of active Ni surface by sintering, leaching of Ni and promoter metal and poisoning of the active Ni surface by organic species [45,49–51]. As alternative to Ni based catalysts, supported noble metals, such as platinum (Pt), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd) and ruthenium (Ru), have been also studied in glucose hydrogenation [37,52]. One of the most promising system are the supported Ru catalysts as they can be quite active and selective in glucose hydrogenation [36,37,48,53,54]. The problem with noble metals and particular with ruthenium is their high cost. Therefore, the aim is to design more active ruthenium-based catalysts with the lowest possible cost. Arena [55] studied the deactivation of Ru/Al2O3 catalysts and observed a physical deterioration and poisoning of Ru by gluconic acid, sulfur and iron, being probably the responsible factors for catalyst's deactivation. As reported by Maris et al. [56] a Ru/SiO2 (2.67wt.% Ru) catalyst in the hydrogenation of glucose at 100°C and 8MPa H2 afforded nearly 100% selectivity to sugar alcohol. However, under these conditions the Ru/SiO2 supported catalysts were unstable due to sintering of the Ru particles. Different carbon materials, such as commercial activated carbon (AC), activated carbon cloths (ACC) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), have been also tested as supports for noble metals in this reaction. Gallezot et al. [57] studied the hydrogenation of glucose using a 40wt.% aqueous solution in a trickle-bed reactor over Ru catalysts supported on active charcoal pellets (1.6wt.% Ru/C), at 100°C under 8MPa H2 for 29h. They found a very high conversion of glucose (98.5%) with equally high selectivity to sorbitol (99.6%). It was also shown that the activity of the Ru catalysts was stable over a long period of time. Another study by the same group [58] reported that Ru catalysts supported on activated carbon cloths (ACC) obtained by carbonization of woven rayon fabric are very selective in the hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol. Perrard et al. [59] have demonstrated that Pt/ACC catalysts exhibited also high activity in d-glucose hydrogenation and provided higher yields of d-sorbitol (>99.5%) compared to Pt/C catalysts supported on carbon powder or extrudates. Crezee et al. [54] studied the hydrolytic hydrogenation of d-glucose over a 5% Ru/C catalyst in a semi-batch autoclave reactor operating at 373–403K and 4.0–7.5MPa hydrogen pressure. The Ru/C catalyst showed in all experiments a high selectivity to d-sorbitol (>98%). In another work, ruthenium on multiwall carbon nanotubes (Ru/MWNTs) demonstrated higher catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of glucose at short reaction time (2h) and 4MPa H2 pressure at 120°C, compared to other catalysts such as Raney Ni and Ru supported on Al2O3 and SiO2 [60]. Following the above studies, in the present work we investigated further the activity and selectivity of Pt and Ru catalysts supported on activated micro/mesoporous carbon. More specifically, we focused on the effect of metal content (1–5%), the method of metal pre-treatment/reduction (H2 at 350°C or NaBH4) and the effect of reaction time (1–12h). Furthermore, we selected a relatively high reaction temperature, i.e. 180°C (compared to the 100–120°C used in most glucose hydrogenation studies with noble metals) in order to evaluate the performance of such catalysts in one-pot processes of cellulose direct conversion to sugar alcohols. The observed catalytic results and proposed reaction pathways were discussed in the light of metal dispersion, oxidation state and surface characteristics of the catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The platinum (Pt) and ruthenium (Ru) supported catalysts were prepared by classical wet impregnation method using a micro/mesoporous activated carbon (Norit SAE SUPER, SSA =1175m2/g). In a typical procedure, i.e. for the 1wt.% Ru catalyst, RuCl3 (Fluka) aq. (0.300mmol in 20mL of water) was added dropwise into a suspension of activated carbon (AC) and water (50mL), and the mixture was stirred for 24h at room temperature. Water was then removed under vacuum at 60°C and the recovered Ru/AC solid was added to a 50mL 0.4M NaBH4–ethanol solution. The mixture was kept under stirring at room temperature until the bubble generation (indicates the formation of H2 from NaBH4) ceased, which generally took about 4h. The reduced Ru/AC catalyst was separated from the solution by vacuum filtration, followed by thorough washing with deionized water until the pH value of the filtrate reached 7. The catalyst sample was finally dried at room temperature overnight. The same procedure was performed for the supported Pt catalysts, using hexachloro-platinic(IV) acid hexahydrate (∼40% Pt) (Alfa) as metal source. The catalyst samples prepared by the above procedure were denoted as x% M/AC-B, where x is the content of the metal (1, 3 or 5wt.%), M is the type of metal (Pt or Ru) and B indicates the use of NaBH4 as reductant. The reduction of metals in the impregnated catalysts was also performed in a flow reactor under 100% H2 flow (50mL/min) at 350°C for 1h (heating rate – 2°C/min, step-wise heating with 30min intervals at 150 and 250°C). The obtained catalyst samples were denoted as x% M/AC-H, where x is the metal content (1, 3 or 5wt.%), M is the type of metal (Pt or Ru) and H indicates the use of H2 as reductant."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The parent activated carbon and supported metal catalysts were characterized with various techniques, such as ICP-AES (chemical analysis), N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, XRD, XPS, HRTEM and Boehm titration (determination of total acidity). The chemical composition (wt.% of Pt and Ru) was determined by inductive coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using a Plasma 400 (Perkin Elmer) spectrometer, equipped with Cetac6000AT+ ultrasonic nebulizer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were conducted on a Shimadzu XRD 7000 diffractometer using a CuKα X-ray radiation operating at 45kV and 100mA; counts were accumulated in the range of 10–80° 2θ every 0.02° (2θ) with counting time 2s per step. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiments at −196°C were performed for the determination of specific surface area (multi-point BET method), total pore volume (at P/Po=0.99), mircopore area by t-plot analysis and pore size distribution (BJH method using adsorption data) of the samples which were previously outgassed at 150°C for 16h under 5×10−9 Torr vacuum, using an Automatic Volumetric Sorption Analyzer (Autosorb-1MP, Quantachrome). XPS spectra were recorded using a SSX-100 spectrometer, Model 206 from Surface Science Instrument with monochromatic Al-K radiation. The peaks assigned to the Pt4f, Ru3p, Cl2p and O1s levels were quantitatively analyzed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM and HRTEM) experiments were carried out in a JEOL 2011 high resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 200kV, with a point resolution of 0.23nm and C s =1.0mm. The instrument is also fitted with an Oxford Instruments INCAx-sight liquid nitrogen cooled energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector with an Si(Li) window for chemical analysis of the samples. Qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of EDS data was accomplished using the INCA Microanalysis Suite software. Samples were prepared by gently grinding the catalyst in high-purity ethanol using an agate pestle and mortar. A drop of the suspension was subsequently deposited onto a lacey carbon-film supported on a Cu grid and allowed to evaporate under ambient conditions."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The d-glucose hydrogenation experiments were performed at 180°C for 3 and 12h at relatively low H2 pressure (1.6MPa) in a stainless steel high-pressure autoclave reactor (Parr) by vigorous stirring (1100rpm), in order to eliminate the diffusion effects. In a typical run, 0.14g of d-glucose (Aldrich), 0.06g of catalyst and water (5mL) were charged in the reactor. After reaction, the mixture was cooled and the catalyst was separated by vacuum filtration. Gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) was applied for the analysis of the reaction products. The liquid samples were first dried via gentle evaporation of water under vacuum (at 60°C) and were then silylated by adding 1mL of pyridine (Py) and 1mL of sylilation agent (bistrimethyl-sylil-trifluoroacetamide) per 100mg of liquid sample. The mixture was maintained at 60°C, for 30min, under vigorous stirring. The samples were then cooled to room temperature and were analyzed by using a GC–MS Carlo Erba Instruments QMD 1000 equipped with a Factor Four VF-5HT column with the following characteristics: 0.32mm×0.1μm×15m working with a temperature program at a pressure of 0.38Torr with helium used as the carrier gas."

6,Physicochemical characteristics of the catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical characteristics of the catalysts The metal content of the prepared Ru or Pt/AC catalysts, reduced either with NaBH4 or with H2, and their porosity characteristics (total surface area and pore volume as well as micropore area) are shown in Table 1 . The activated carbon (AC) used as catalyst support comprises both micro- and mesoporous according to the producer (Norit SAE SUPER) and this was verified by the N2 sorption experiments of this work. As can be seen in Table 1, a relatively small portion of the total surface area of AC corresponds to micropore area (∼28%), the rest being mainly mesopore as well as macropore and external surface area. This can be easily deduced also from the shape of the N2 isotherms of the parent AC sample shown in Fig. 1 , where a progressive N2 uptake is observed over the whole P/Po range, thus indicating the presence of relatively disordered network of meso- and macropores. A typical highly microporous material would exhibit a plateau or at least a less pronounced increase of N2 uptake at P/Po values higher of ca. 0.2. The pore size distribution based on BJH analysis (shown as inset in Fig. 1) and DFT analysis (not shown for brevity) of the adsorption data show the presence of mesopores with sizes up to ca. 20nm and with average pore diameter of about 2–2.5nm. Considering that the kinetic diameter of glucose is ∼0.8nm (8Å), we expected that such as an activated carbon with abundant mesopores would exhibit reduced diffusion limitations for glucose, thus increasing conversion rates, and enhanced product (i.e. sorbitol) desorption, thus minimizing secondary hydrogenolysis or epimerization reactions. A similar concept of enhanced mass transfer and desorption from the micropores to the liquid phase improving the selectivity to sorbitol has been previously described for activated carbon cloths due to the specific particle morphology [59]. Impregnation of AC with Ru and Pt metal salts and subsequent reduction either by NaBH4 or at 350°C under H2 flow resulted in a relatively limited decrease of surface area and total pore volume, not exceeding ca. 30% reduction for the catalysts with the highest metal loading (∼5wt.%). As the shape of the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and of the pore size distribution of the metal loaded AC (representative isotherms and curves are shown in Fig. 1) are similar to those of the parent AC, it can be suggested that the morphology and texture of the activated carbon has not been significantly altered either due to the wet impregnation procedure or during the reduction process. However, it is interesting to notice that the micropore area (Table 1) has been decreased by as high as 45%, and this can probably be attributed to the blocking of micropores by the very small and well dispersed metal nanoparticles (as shown below). Representative XRD patterns of the parent AC and the 3% Ru and Pt/AC catalysts reduced either by NaBH4 or by H2 at 350°C are shown in Fig. 2 . No characteristic diffraction lines of metallic (or oxide) species can be observed in the XRD patterns of both the Ru and Pt catalysts, irrespective of the reduction method applied. The absence of the diffraction lines indicates either the presence of metal or metal oxide crystallites smaller than ca. 3nm or the absence of any crystalline material. Similar XRD patterns have been obtained for all the rest of the catalysts, except for the 5% Pt/AC catalysts (reduced by both methods), in which characteristic diffraction lines for metallic platinum were detected (data not shown for brevity) indicating an increase of the crystal size. In order to further investigate the metal particle size distribution and its crystalline nature, representative catalysts were characterized by TEM and HRTEM measurements. Fig. 3a shows a characteristic TEM image of the 3% Ru/AC-H catalyst (reduced with H2 at 350°C). The sample comprises of tiny Ru nanoparticles that are widely dispersed all over the AC surface. The size of the nanoparticles lies in the range 2–4nm, while it was 2–3nm for the 1wt.% Ru catalyst and 2–5nm for the 5% Ru catalyst, irrespective of the method of reduction (images not shown). The 5% Ru/AC-B catalyst contained also aggregates (10–25nm) of smaller nanoparticles. HRTEM images of the Ru nanoparticles, such as the one shown as inset in Fig. 3a revealed that they are metallic and predominately expose ( 10 1 ¯ 1 ) Ru planes, with an average spacing of 0.205nm. The 3% Pt/AC-H catalyst shows a similar high dispersion, as can be seen in Fig. 3b. The Pt nanoparticles are evenly dispersed over the AC substrate and have a size distribution of 1–4nm, which is also observed in the 1% Pt/AC-H catalyst (1–3nm) and the 5% Pt/AC-H catalyst (2–6nm). HRTEM imaging experiments showed that the Pt nanoparticles are, in their greatest majority, in metallic form. A typical HRTEM image of a Pt nanoparticle exhibiting its (111) planes is shown in the inset of Fig. 3b. Nicely dispersed Pt single crystal nanoparticles (2–4nm) were also found on the 1% Pt/AC-B NaBH4 reduced catalysts. On the other hand, the 3% and 5% Pt/AC-B catalysts also contained several crystalline nanoparticle aggregates with size of up to 10–25nm, in addition to discrete Pt nanoparticles (2–4nm). A more detailed HRTEM investigation of the catalysts also revealed the presence of the agglomerated particle morphology shown in Fig. 4a for the 3% Ru/AC-H catalyst. These agglomerates were up to 20–30nm in size and consisted of both discrete crystalline metallic Ru nanoparticles (1–4nm), as well as additional amorphous material in between, which was Ru-based as detected by EDS. The chemical analysis also indicated a slight increase in the oxygen content in these areas, which postulates the existence of Ru species in oxidized form, in accordance with the XPS measurements (discussed below). Such phases were observed in all Ru catalysts, as also shown for example for the 5% Ru/AC-B catalyst in Fig. 4b; however, in the 5% Ru catalysts the well-formed crystalline nanoparticles become more abundant compared to the 1% Ru catalysts. The Pt catalysts also contained such agglomerated phases, mainly in the 5% Pt loaded ones. As a general observation regarding the effect of preparation method, the reduction with NaBH4 seemed to favor the formation of such amorphous oxygen enriched metal phases to a higher extent compared to the reduction with H2 at 350°C. XPS measurements (Fig. 5 , Table 2 ) showed the existence of different kinds of metallic and oxidic surface species, in different proportions, as a function of the reduction method (i.e. NaBH4 or H2 at 350°C) and as a function of the amount and type of metal. Upon reduction with hydrogen, chlorine was not completely eliminated and the metal was reduced at a certain degree. Indeed, as can be seen in Fig. 5, the XPS spectra for Ru3d level (samples Ru/AC reduced with H2) show the presence of Ru species both in metallic and oxidized states, as evidenced by the identification of metallic Ru (280.5eV) and RuO (281.6eV) bands after deconvolution of those spectra. In addition, part of the ruthenium precursor was not decomposed since the RuCl component (282.1eV) could also be identified in the spectra. Very similar results were collected from the analysis in the Ru3p region (spectra not shown) where the band assigned to metallic Ru was located at 459.8eV, that of RuO at 462.2eV and that of RuCl at 463.2eV. Contrarily, the use of NaBH4 as reductant, at least under the conditions applied in our work, led to complete elimination of chlorine, but the metal was not reduced to M(0), as can be seen in the respective spectra of the Ru/AC-B samples in Fig. 5. The data in Table 2 shows that the reduction with H2 at 350°C leads to a higher portion of M(0) phase over M n+ on the surface of metal particles, both for Pt and Ru, with Ru exhibiting a slightly higher reducibility compared to Pt. When Cl is taken into account, the M(0) portion becomes even smaller for both metals, indicating that some metal ions are still connected to chlorine. The presence of oxygen in the reduced catalysts can be associated, firstly, with the low oxygen functionalities on activated carbon, representing centers for docking the metal, and, secondly, to the hydrolysis of precursor metal salts during the impregnation [61]."
7,Catalytic results,"3.2 Catalytic results The Pt and Ru/AC catalysts prepared in this work were tested in the hydrogenation of glucose and the conversion and selectivity results are given in Table 3 . Since a number of studies on carbon supported noble metal catalysts have already shown the high glucose hydrogenation activity and sorbitol selectivity of such systems at relatively low reaction temperatures (i.e. 100–120°C) [37,44,54,57,59,62], one of the objectives of this work was to investigate the performance of Ru and Pt/AC supported catalysts at higher reaction temperatures, i.e. 180°C, which are more typical for the one-pot processes of cellulose direct conversion to sugar alcohols. These higher temperature conditions are necessary for promoting the initial depolymerization/hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose under mild acidic conditions [26–28]. However, the higher temperature could promote hydrogenolysis reactions toward smaller sugar alcohols (i.e. glycerol) and thus sacrifice the selectivity toward sorbitol. This hypothesis was verified in the present study, but mainly for the Ru/AC catalysts and to a lesser extent for the Pt/AC catalysts. In addition, we studied the effect of metal content, method of metal reduction and reaction time and we used relatively low H2 pressure (1.6MPa compared to 3–8MPa applied in most studies) in an effort to enhance the sustainability of the process. From the data in Table 3 it can be seen that the hydrogenation of glucose at 180°C for 3h and 1.6MPa H2 pressure without catalyst (blank experiment) gave very low conversion (4.4%) and d-galactofuranose as the main product (not listed in Table 3). On the other hand, the parent AC itself had a moderate activity in glucose conversion and the main obtained products were d-galactofuranose, propanoic and acetic acid. It can be suggested that the basic surface properties of the parent AC (pH in water 8–9) and the presence of H2 promoted the formation of d-galactofuranose which was then decomposed via hydrogenolysis to the two smaller carboxylic acids. In the case of metal catalysts, all samples were highly active, with the supported Ru catalysts, reduced either with NaBH4 or with H2 at 350°C, exhibiting 100% conversion (Table 3). The corresponding supported Pt catalysts were slightly less active at low metal loading (∼98% with the 1% and 3% Pt/AC-B catalysts), while reduction of Pt catalysts with H2, instead of NaBH4, resulted in slightly further decrease to ca. 97% conversion with the low metal content catalysts (Table 3). In contrast to glucose conversion, the selectivity to sorbitol was greatly dependent on the type of active metal used as well as on the reaction time, with Pt being clearly more selective compared to Ru (Table 3). The other main products formed were 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol (C6 sugar alcohol), arabinitol (C5 alcohol), threitol and/or meso-erythritol (C4 alcohol), glycerol and 1,2-propanediol (C3 alcohols). The selectivity to sorbitol with the 1% Ru/AC-B catalyst was 54% while 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol, 1,2-propanediol and glycerol were also formed with selectivity values of ∼6%, 20% and 17% respectively. Increase of the metal content favored glucose hydrogenation toward sorbitol (73% selectivity with the 3% Ru/AC-B catalyst) with the parallel formation of arabinitol (12% selectivity) and minor formation of glycerol, 1,2-propanediol and C4 sugars (ca. 3–6% selectivity). Interestingly, by further increase of Ru loading (5% Ru/AC-B) the formation of arabinitol increased to ∼25% with a subsequent significant decrease of sorbitol selectivity to 55%. This volcano-type relationship between sorbitol yield and Ru content can be also clearly seen in Fig. 6 , which shows the effect of the various Ru catalysts (with 1, 3 and 5wt.% metal and reduced by NaBH4 or H2) on glucose conversion and sorbitol yield (%). Regarding the selectivity and yield of sorbitol for the Ru/AC-H catalysts (reduced with H2 at 350°C), a similar volcano-type behavior was observed, with the 3wt.% Ru/AC-H catalyst being more selective (89% selectivity) than the corresponding NaBH4 reduced catalyst (Table 3 and Fig. 6). The selectivity of the Ru/AC-H catalysts toward the rest of the products (i.e. 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol, arabinitol, threitol and/or meso-erythritol, 1,2-propanediol and glycerol) was at similar levels to those with the NaBH4 reduced catalysts (Table 3). In comparison to the supported Ru/AC catalysts, the 1% Pt/AC-B (reduced with NaBH4) was highly selective toward sorbitol (92%), while other products, such as arabinitol and glycerol, were also formed but with low selectivity (1–4%), as can be seen in Table 3. By increasing the Pt loading to 3% and 5% the selectivity to sorbitol was further increased (up to 95%) with arabinitol and glycerol as minor by-products. Furthermore, the Pt catalysts reduced with NaBH4 were slightly more selective to sorbitol than the corresponding catalysts reduced in H2 at 350°C, as evidenced for the catalysts with higher metal loading (i.e. with 3 and 5wt.% Pt). In all cases, the yield of sorbitol with the Pt/AC catalysts was equal or higher than ca. 90%, as can be seen in Fig. 7 . The effect of reaction time was studied by using the 3% Ru and Pt catalysts that have been reduced with NaBH4. As can be seen in Table 3, increase of reaction time from 3 to 12h has negligible effect on the activity of the catalysts as it was expected since they reached almost 100% conversion even after 3h of reaction. On the other hand, the effect on product selectivity was quite different amongst the two metals. The selectivity to sorbitol dropped from 73% to 60% for the 3% Ru/AC-B catalyst, with parallel increase of arabinitol selectivity (from 12% to 20%). In contrast to the Ru catalyst, the selectivity to sorbitol with the 3% Pt/AC-B catalyst decreased only by 3% (from 94% to 91%) accompanied with a limited formation of glycerol (2.5%) and arabinitol (4.7%). These data clearly show that depending on the type of metal (i.e. Ru or Pt) the reaction conditions usually applied in one-pot cellulose hydrolysis–hydrogenolysis to sugar alcohols can induce different selectivity profiles compared to the milder conditions for optimum glucose conversion to sorbitol. In order to further support this argument, the 3% Ru/AC-B catalyst was also tested at even shorter reaction time of 1h. The conversion of glucose was still 100% while the selectivity value of sorbitol increased to 93%. The mechanism of sorbitol formation involves the dissociative adsorption of molecular H2 on hydrogenation metals such as Pt, Ru, Ni, and the subsequent addition of the pair of hydrogen atoms to the hemiacetal group of glucose, leading to the cleavage of the CO bond and the formation of the hydroxyl (OH) group [27,34,37]. This reaction step occurs readily on specific metals and catalytic systems even at low reaction temperatures of ca. 100–120°C and H2 pressures of ca. 3–8MPa, as has been previously shown in studies aimed for maximization of sorbitol selectivity and yield [37,54,59]. However, under higher reaction temperatures and time, the Ru catalysts appear less selective toward sorbitol compared to Pt catalysts, as we observed in the present work, leading also to the formation of 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol, arabinitol, threitol and/or meso-erythritol, 1,2-propanediol and glycerol. The production of C2–C5 sugar alcohols and other related by-products have been also found in previous works with different catalytic systems [27,40,57,63]. Furthermore, the low Ru content catalysts (1wt.% Ru) that have been reduced with either method (NaBH4 or H2) exhibit a different product selectivity compared to the higher (3–5wt.%) Ru content catalysts, favoring the formation of 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol which is absent from the products of 3% and 5% Ru catalysts (Table 3). In order to elucidate this performance, the HRTEM measurements can provide useful evidence. In the HRTEM image of Fig. 4a and b, the co-existence of small crystalline metallic Ru nanoparticles together with amorphous Ru(O) x δ+ species within relatively larger aggregates (20–30nm) was identified. Based on this Ru morphology, a model of formation of protonic acid sites Ru(O) x H+, as well as of protons released in the aqueous solution, can be suggested, as is schematically presented in Fig. 4c. The model is based on the dissociative adsorption of molecular H2 on metallic Ru(0) nanoparticles followed by spillover of the formed hydrogen atoms to adjacent Ru(O) δ+ species with simultaneous electron transfer from the H atoms to the positively charged RuO species. A similar model for the formation of protonic acid sites was also proposed for metals able to dissociate H2 (such as Pt) that were supported on Lewis solid acids (such as SO4/ZrO2), where the Lewis acidity of the support served as the electron acceptor from the hydrogen atoms formed on the metals [26,35]. These protonic Ru(O) x H+ acidic sites as well as the released H+ in solution can induce the conversion of the initially formed sorbitol on the metallic Ru nanoparticles to 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol via dehydration reactions, as schematically presented in Fig. 8 . The dehydroxylation of sorbitol at C3 and C4 positions generates unsaturated intermediate species with two double bonds at C2C3 and C4C5 positions, which are finally hydrogenated to the saturated 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol molecule. Furthermore, based on the data of Table 3, the simultaneous formation of glycerol together with 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol, by the 1% Ru/AC catalysts, can be rationalized by an additional reaction pathway, through which glycerol is formed via hydrogenolysis of the C3C4 bond of sorbitol (Fig. 8). Glycerol can be then converted to 1,2-propanediol via dehydration reaction, while this molecule can be also formed via hydrogenolysis of the C3C4 bond of 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol (Fig. 8). Different predominant reaction pathways seem to apply for the higher (3–5%) Ru content catalysts compared to 1% Ru catalysts, according to the catalytic results of Table 3. These catalysts, except sorbitol, produce mainly arabinitol (C5 sugar alcohol) and threitol and/or meso-erythritol (C4 sugar alcohol) as by-products. Furthermore, the selectivity to arabinitol increases with higher Ru loading, reaching as high as 25% with the 5% Ru/AC-B catalyst. This behavior can be attributed to the hydrogenolysis of the C1C2 or C5C6 bonds of the initially formed sorbitol, as schematically presented in Fig. 9 . Furthermore, the formation of the C4 sugar alcohols can be attributed to the hydrogenolysis of the C2C3 or C4C5 bonds of sorbitol. The C4 alcohols can also be produced by consecutive hydrogenolysis of the C1C2 or C4C5 bonds of arabinitol, as shown in Fig. 9. Glycerol is also produced via hydrogenolysis of the C4 sugar alcohols, is then converted to 1,2-propanediol via dehydration reaction (Fig. 9). The shift from the initial dehydration reaction of sorbitol proposed for the 1% Ru/AC catalysts (Fig. 8) to the hydrogenolysis routes can be correlated with the relative increase of the number of crystalline metallic Ru nanoparticles (2–5nm) in the 3% and 5% Ru/AC catalysts, compared to the number of aggregated particles that contained the amorphous Ru(O) x δ+ phases, as observed from the TEM measurements. With regard to Pt/AC catalysts and based on the respective catalytic data (Table 3 and Fig. 7) it can be suggested that the predominant reaction pathway is the hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol, even at this relatively high reaction temperature of 180°C as well as at higher reaction times of ca. 12h. Arabinitol is also here the main by-product, but at much lower selectivity levels (2–8%) compared to Ru catalysts. Its formation can be attributed also to the hydrogenolysis pathway described in Fig. 9 for the Ru catalysts. The Pt content and the method of reduction do not seem to affect significantly the reaction pathways, although a slight enhancement of the hydrogenolysis of the initially formed sorbitol can be identified with the high (5%) Pt loading catalyst reduced with H2. This is further supported with the observation from the TEM measurements that the reduction of Pt with H2 compared to NaBH4 leads to more single crystal Pt nanoparticles and less aggregated particles, the former favoring the hydrogenolysis reactions."
8,Conclusions,"The results of the present work showed that both Ru and Pt supported on activated carbon (AC) can be very active in the hydrogenation of glucose (conversion ≥97%), even at relatively low H2 pressure (ca. 1.6MPa). The selectivity however to sorbitol or other smaller sugar alcohols was greatly dependent on various parameters, such type of metal (Ru or Pt), metal content (1–5wt.%), method of metal reduction (H2 at 350°C or NaBH4) and reaction time (1–12h). Furthermore, a relatively high reaction temperature was used, i.e. 180°C, in order to simulate closer the conditions applied in the direct hydrogenolysis of cellulose toward C2–C6 sugar alcohols. Under these conditions, the Pt/AC catalysts were highly selective toward sorbitol (sel. ≥90%) irrespective of metal content and method of reduction. The main by-product formed was arabinitol with selectivity not exceeding ca. 8% either when using a high Pt content (5wt.%) catalyst or at a longer reaction time (12h). On the other hand, the Ru/AC catalysts were less selective toward sorbitol (sel. 55–90%). The main by-products with the Ru catalysts were 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol, arabinitol, threitol and/or meso-erythritol, glycerol and 1,2-propanediol and their formation was dependent on the crystallinity and nature of the Ru particles. In the 1% Ru/AC catalysts, the presence of aggregates comprising crystalline Ru(0) metallic nanoparticles (1–4nm) as well as amorphous Ru(O) x δ+ phases which are responsible for the generation of protonic acidic sites, favored the dehydration and hydrogenolysis of sorbitol toward 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol and glycerol respectively. On the other hand, the relatively higher portion of crystalline Ru metallic nanoparticles (2–5nm) which was evident on the 3–5% Ru/AC catalysts, mainly on those reduced by H2 at 350°C, favored the hydrogenolysis of the initially produced sorbitol to arabinitol and C4 sugar alcohols, as well as glycerol. In both the above suggested mechanisms, 1,2-propanediol was also produced via glycerol dehydration. The higher selectivity of the Pt/AC catalysts toward sorbitol could be related to the abundance of well formed, single crystal Pt nanoparticles (2–6nm) compared to the less crystalline Ru/AC catalysts. However, differences in the intrinsic reactivity of Pt and Ru metals in the hydrogenolysis of the CC bonds in sorbitol should be also considered as a possible cause for the observed variations in product selectivity."
