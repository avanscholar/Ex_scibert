0,Introduction,"Anaerobic fermentation has been serving as a mild and sustainable platform for chemicals and biofuels production (Steen et al., 2010). Typical products include bioethanol, biobunanol, short-chain carboxylates (SCCs, C2-C5) and lactate (carboxylates include dissociated carboxylic acids and the undissociated carboxylic acids). However, due to the complete miscibility of these bioproducts with fermentation broth, complex and costly extraction processes are required (Wu et al., 2019c). In addition to the relatively low value of these bioproducts, economic feasibility of this technology remains to be discussed, which largely restrict its exploitability. In recent years, chain elongation (CE) technology was raised to upgrade SCCs, alcohols and lactate into medium-chain carboxylates (MCCs) through microbial metabolism (Dellomonaco et al., 2011; Steinbusch et al., 2011). MCCs are the carboxylates with 6-12 carbon atoms (C6-C12), which include caproate (C6), heptylate (C7) and caprylate (C8) etc. Upgrading the aforementioned typical bio-products into MCCs in the fermentation system could achieve the following benefits: (1) the value of MCCs are considerably higher than their precursors (i.e. the aforementioned typical bio-products), which could significantly enhance the economic viability of the anaerobic fermentation platform. (2) The significant lower solubility of MCCs in fermentation broth would make the subsequent extraction process much less energy-intensive and more cost-effective (Angenent et al., 2016). (3) Through the CE, resource waste and environmental pollution caused by the discharge of SCCs, alcohols and lactate that reject from distillation could be avoided (Kucek et al., 2016b). (4) The residual recalcitrantly biodegradable organics in anaerobic fermentation system can also add burden on the subsequent treatment and disposal. The combination of residual gasification and MCCs production from syngas could achieve the full bioconversion of organics, bringing great environmental benefits especially when organic wastes are used as substrate (Spirito et al., 2014; Han et al., 2019). MCCs have wide applications in diverse industries. MCCs are used as “green” antibiotics in agriculture, food additives and nutritional therapy in food industry, and they can serve as important chemical building blocks, like the precursors of plasticizers, lubricants, surfactants, adhesives and flavors (Sarria et al., 2017). In recent years, MCCs have demonstrated high potential in new energy field as fuel precursors, like the synthesis of jet fuel and diesel. However, MCCs have been traditionally derived either from plant and animal oils or from petroleum cracking, both of which have high requirement for investment and facilities. In addition, the high demand of MCCs may result in the competition with food and environmental concerns, which in turn limits the large-scale application of MCCs (Steen et al., 2010). CE by microbiome in the anaerobic fermentation system supplies a more scalable, economic and environmentally friendly alternative way to produce MCCs. This paper gives a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of microbial MCCs production from CO/CO2, synthetic substrates and waste organic materials. Detailed introduction of CE pathways, electron donors (ED) used in CE, MCCs production from various substrate sources, microorganisms capable of performing CE, factors that influence the MCCs production, strategies for enhancing MCCs production, and the technologies used for MCCs separation and extraction from fermentation broth are analyzed and summarized. The challenges and perspectives of MCCs production are put forward, supplying suggestions for the future research."
1,Chain elongation pathways,"The chain elongation (CE) pathways for MCCs production include reverse β oxidation (RBO) pathway and fatty acid biosynthesis (FAB) pathway. Both RBO and FAB pathways are circular reactions. Through each cyclic process, two carbon atoms are added to the starter molecule, and the repeated cyclic processes can achieve the production of MCCs with 6-12 carbons. (Fig. 1 ). RBO pathway is the most widely studied CE pathway for MCCs production. RBO pathway centers on acetyl-CoA, which is used as carbon donor (Wu et al., 2020b), and SCCs provide carbon sources to form (Cn)-Acyl-CoA (Han et al., 2019). The circular reaction begins with the coupling of acetyl-CoA and (Cn)-Acyl-CoA, forming a 2-carbon-added CoA derivative ((Cn+2)-β-Ketoacyl-CoA). Then, (Cn+2)-β-Ketoacyl-CoA is further converted to (Cn+2)-Acyl-CoA by a series of reactions, which are catalyzed by ketoacyl-CoA reductase, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase and enoyl-CoA reductase. In addition, the CoA in (Cn+2)-Acyl-CoA is transferred to (Cn)-Carboxylic acid, forming (Cn)-Acyl-CoA and (Cn+2)-Carboxylic acid. In this way, CE from Cn to Cn+2 is achieved, and the formed (Cn)-Acyl-CoA can participate in the next circular reaction (Han et al., 2018). RBO pathway has been widely reported in CE systems (Dellomonaco et al., 2011; Agler et al., 2012; Kucek et al., 2016a; Kucek et al., 2016b), microbes capable of producing MCCs through RBO pathway include Clostridium spp. like C. kluyveri, C. difficile, C. botulinum, C. thermocellum (Han et al., 2018), Megasphaera elsdenii (Kucek et al., 2016b) and Caproiciproducens (Candry et al., 2020a). FAB pathway is an alternative CE pathway for MCCs production. FAB pathway centers on Acyl carrier protein (ACP), which is the cofactor protein. During the FAB process, ACP combines with fatty acyl intermediate products through the phosphopantetheine linker. Similar to RBO pathway, acetyl-CoA is also needed in FAB process, but the 2-carbon donor used in FAB pathway is malonyl-ACP. Thus, during the FAB process, acetyl-CoA is firstly converted into malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which is then transferred to malonyl-ACP, and finally entered the FAB cycle. The circular reaction begins with the coupling of malonyl-ACP and (Cn)-Acyl-ACP catalyzed ketoacyl-ACP synthase, forming a 2-carbon-added ACP derivative ((Cn+2)-β-Ketoacyl-ACP). Then, (Cn+2)-β-Ketoacyl-ACP is further converted into (Cn+2)-Acyl-ACP by a series of reactions, which are catalyzed by a series of reductases, including ketoacyl-ACP reductase, hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase and enoyl-ACP reductase. In addition, the ACP in (Cn+2)-Acyl-ACP is transferred to (Cn)-Carboxylic acid, forming (Cn)-Acyl-ACP and (Cn+2)-Carboxylic acid. In this way, CE from Cn to Cn+2 is achieved, and the formed (Cn)-Acyl-ACP can participate in the next circular reaction (Chan and Vogel, 2010; Steen et al., 2010). Comparing with RBO pathway, FAB pathway is longer with the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-ACP processes before the FAB cycle. In addition, the synthesis of malonyl-ACP consumes 1 ATP per molecule, and more ATP is committed to ACP intermediates synthesis (Chan and Vogel, 2010). Thus, FAB pathway is less efficient. However, it was found that FAB pathway was more active and pivotal during the CE in mixed-culture fermentation systems (Wu et al., 2020b). During the CE process, acetyl-CoA is electron donor (ED), and SCCs is electron accepter (EA). Both ED and EA have great impact on CE process."
2,Electron donors,"Electron donor (ED) is defined as the reduced compound supplying energy, reducing equivalents (NADH) and acetyl-CoA required by the CE process (Spirito et al., 2014). Lots of substances have been reported to be capable of serving as ED solely or synergistically in CE systems for MCCs production, like alcohols, lactate, polysaccharides, H2 and CO (Han et al., 2019). As shown in Fig. 1, all ED need to be converted into acetyl-CoA before entering the RBO or FAB processes for CE."
3,Alcohols,"3.1 Alcohols Alcohols used for CE include methanol (de Leeuw et al., 2020), ethanol (Agler et al., 2012), glycerol (Leng et al., 2017), galactitol (Jeon et al., 2010), and propanol (Kenealy and Waselefsky, 1985). Among them, ethanol is most widely studied for its high CE efficiency (Han et al., 2019). Eqs. 1-5 shows the thermodynamic equations of caproate (C6) production from ethanol and acetate. The negative values of standard Gibbs free energy indicate that under standard conditions (1 atm, 25 °C, and 1 M), the production of caproate (C6) by CE using ethanol as ED is thermodynamically feasible. (1) CH 3 CH 2 OH + CH 3 COO − → CH 3 CH 2 2 COO − + H 2 O Δ G r o = − 38.6 kJ / mol (2) CH 3 CH 2 OH + CH 3 CH 2 2 COO − → CH 3 CH 2 4 COO − + H 2 O Δ G r o = − 38.8 kJ / mol (3) 12 CH 3 CH 2 OH + 3 CH 3 COO − → 5 CH 3 CH 2 4 COO − + 2 H + + 4 H 2 + 8 H 2 O Δ G r o = − 30.6 kJ / mol (4) 6 CH 3 CH 2 OH + 3 CH 3 COO − → 3 CH 3 CH 2 2 COO − + CH 3 CH 2 4 COO − + 2 H + + 2 H 2 + 4 H 2 O Δ G r o = − 183.0 kJ / mol (5) 2 CH 3 CH 2 OH + CH 3 COO − → CH 3 CH 2 4 COO − + 2 H 2 O Δ G r o = − 79.0 kJ / mol For the consumed ethanol, around 5/6 is used for CE, while the other 1/6 is oxidized into acetate by phosphorylation to provide metabolic energy (ATP) (Eq. 6) (Spirito et al., 2014). Eq. 7 gives an overall description of CE reaction using ethanol as ED (Roghair et al., 2018a). (6) CH 3 CH 2 OH + H 2 O → CH 3 COO − + H + + 2 H 2 Δ G r o = 10.5 kJ / mol (7) 5 C n H 2 n − 1 O 2 − + 6 CH 3 CH 2 OH → 5 C n + 2 H 2 n + 3 O 2 − + CH 3 COO − + 4 H 2 O + H + + 2 H 2 Ethanol can be obtained from wide range of sources, like winery wastewater, stillage and the syngas fermentation effluent. In addition, the controlled fermentation of various organic wastes, like agricultural residuals, food wastes etc. is also widely study for bioethanol production (Baeyens et al., 2015). For example, Wu et al. (2020a) adopted liquor-making wastewater as substrate for MCCs production, achieved caproate (C6), heptylate (C7) and caprylate (C8) production of 12.3, 1.9 and 2.8 g COD/L, respectively. Scarborough et al. (2018) and Straeuber et al. (2018) used switchgrass stillage and maize silage as substrate for MCCs production, ethanol is in-situ produced to serve as ED, caproate (C6) production of 2.6 g/L/d and 0.1-8.1 g/kg VS were obtained. Gildemyn et al. (2017) and Vasudevan et al. (2014) conducted the CE process to upgrade the syngas fermentation effluent, achieved caproate (C6) production of 2.19 and 8.6 mM, respectively. Besides ethanol, alcohols like methanol, propanol, galactitol and glycerol were also explored as EDs for CE to expand the substrate source for MCCs production. Methanol can be synthesized from CO2, contributing to CO2 fixation (Zhong et al., 2020). Chen et al. (2016) first explored the feasibility of utilizing methanol as ED for the CE of acetate, achieved butyrate (C4) and caproate (C6) production of 191 mM and 3 mM, respectively. Concurrent use of methanol and ethanol for CE achieved caproate (C6) production of 1.5-5.9 g/L/d (Candry et al., 2020b). Propanol is usually produced from ethylene through chemical processes. Kenealy and Waselefsky (1985) firstly proved the capability of CE by C. kluyveri utilizing propanol as ED. Coma et al. (2016) compared methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol as ED for MCCs production from acetate by mixed cultures, found that butanol was not feasible for CE. MCCs concentrations achieved from different EDs were in order of ethanol > propanol > methanol. Both galactitol and glycerol can be achieved from the hydrolysis of widely attainable seaweed. In addition, glycerol is also a kind of surplus byproduct from waste-derived biodiesel industry (Leng et al., 2017). Jeon et al. (2010, 2013) achieved highest caproate (C6) concentration of 32 g/L and caproate (C6) production rate of 2.99 g/L/d from acetate by strain Clostridium sp. BS-1 utilizing galactitol as ED. Leng et al. (2017) achieved caproate (C6) production of 1.9-11.7 mM from acetate when glycerol was used as ED. Studies found that, during the fermentation process, glycerol firstly hydrolyzed into 1,3-propanediol, ethanol and SCCs. Indicating that glycerol serves as ED by supplying ethanol during the fermentation process. In addition, with the formation of SCCs from glycerol, glycerol can supply both ED and EA, achieving MCCs production through CE (Dams et al., 2018)."
4,Lactate,"3.2 Lactate Lactate is the second most studied ED for CE after ethanol. Before entering the CE process, lactate is firstly oxidized to pyruvate, and then, acetyl-CoA is formed from the further conversion of pyruvate. This process is accompanied with electrons releasement, ATP formation and CO2 releasement. And then, the formed acetyl-CoA enters into the CE process either through RBO pathway or FAB pathway, serving as 2-carbon donor (Eqs. 8-9). Similar to ethanol metabolism, not all lactate can be converted into MCCs, part of lactate is also oxidized into acetate to provide metabolic energy (Eq. 10). Eq. 11 shows caproate (C6) production through lactate oxidation and CE, which is formed through the combination of Eqs. 8-10 (Zhu et al., 2015). (8) CH 3 CH OH COO − + CH 3 COO − + H + → CH 3 CH 2 2 COO − + H 2 O + CO 2 Δ G r o = − 57.5 kJ / mol (9) CH 3 CH OH COO − + CH 3 CH 2 2 COO − + H + → CH 3 CH 2 4 COO − + H 2 O + CO 2 Δ G r o = − 57.7 kJ / mol (10) CH 3 CH OH COO − + H 2 O → CH 3 COO − + 2 H 2 + CO 2 Δ G r o = − 8.8 kJ / mol (11) 3 CH 3 CHOHCOO − + 2 H + → CH 3 CH 2 4 COO − + 2 H 2 + H 2 O + CO 2 Δ G r o = − 123.1 kJ / mol Comparing with ethanol, lactate has lower conversion efficiency for the following two reasons: (1) CO2 releasement during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA induces one carbon lost (Zhu et al., 2015); (2) Lactate can also be converted into propionate through acrylate pathway, and acrylate pathway competes with CE pathways for lactate, deteriorating the carbon conversion efficiency from lactate to MCCs (Kucek et al., 2016a). Studies explored MCCs production from various SCCs utilizing lactate as ED. Kucek et al. (2016a) achieved caproate (C6) production of 8 mM (6.9 g COD/L-d) utilizing butyrate as EA, while Wu et al. (2019b) obtained caproate (C6) production of 1.21-21.04 mM utilizing acetate as EA. Wu et al. (2018) compared acetate, butyrate and caproate as EA for CE, found that acetate was the optimal EA for MCCs production utilizing lactate as ED. When lactate-rich wastes (like dairy wastewater, food waste) is used as substrate, no additional EA or ED is needed. The indigenous SCCs and lactate could serve as EA and ED for CE. For example, in the fermentation systems utilizing food waste as substrate, Nzeteu et al. (2018) found that caproate (C6) production was not directly impacted by the availability of SCCs in food waste, while lactate served as the precursor for CE. Contreras-Davila et al. (2020) found that the in-situ produced lactate in food waste served as both carbon source and ED for CE. Ma et al. (2020) achieved enhanced MCCs production from food waste by pretreating food waste, which stimulated lactic acid production and the subsequent MCCs production. When dairy wastewater is used as substrate, the readily available lactate can be directly utilized for MCCs production. Xu et al. (2018) adopted acid whey from Greek-yogurt waste stream as substrate, achieved MCCs (C6-C9) production rate of 111 mM/L/d without additional EA or ED addition. Similarly, Duber et al. (2018) and Brodowski et al. (2020) achieved caproate (C6) production of 134.3 mM/L/d and 133.4 mM/L/d utilizing dairy wastewater as sole substrate."
5,Saccharides,"3.3 Saccharides Saccharides could also serve as ED for CE. During the process, saccharides are firstly oxidized into pyruvate, and then, acetyl-CoA is formed and enters into the CE pathways. Megasphaera spp. are the most widely reported microbes capable of utilizing saccharides as ED. Since SCCs can also be produced from saccharides degradation, saccharides could serve as both ED and EA source for MCCs production. For example, Roddick and Britz (1997) found that caproate (C6) can be produced by Megasphaera elsdenii directly from glucose. Similarly, Jeon et al. (2016) and Esquivel-Elizondo et al. (2021) also achieved MCCs (C6-C8) production from fructose by Megasphaera sp. MH and Caproiciproducens sp. 7D4C2, respectively. In addition, studies found that the supplementation of EA could significantly enhance the MCCs production from carbohydrates. Jeon et al. (2016) found that MCCs (C6-C8) production from fructose was enhanced from 1.6 g/L to 2.3-10.3 g/L with different SCCs (C2-C5) supplementation. Similarly, Kim et al. (2018) achieved a high caproate (C6) production of 10.08 g/L when butyrate (C4) and fructose were used as EA and ED, respectively. Esquivel-Elizondo et al. (2021) also observed significant increased caproate (C6) production from around 5.8 g/L to 17.4 g/L in fructose fermentation system when butyrate (C4) was supplemented as ED."
6,Reducing gases,"3.4 Reducing gases Reducing gases like H2 and CO can also serve as ED for MCCs production. H2 and CO can either be used directly as ED for CE, or be converted into alcohols (like ethanol, propanol) to serve as ED for CE. Both H2 and CO can be obtained from syngas. The application of H2 and CO in CE process supplies a way for incorporating recalcitrant biomass into MCCs production by coupling thermochemical and biochemical processes. In this way, the full conversion of biomass into chemicals can be achieved (Han et al., 2019). Besides, biomass fermentation (Wang and Yin, 2018b) and water electrolysis utilizing renewable electricity (Reddy et al., 2018) can serve as renewable H2 sources for MCCs production Comparing with soluble compounds, the application of reducing gases in CE is restricted by the low solubility of gases in aqueous phase. To enhance the mass transfer of reducing gases, hollow-fiber membrane is widely used for gases diffusion (Lee et al., 2012; Asimakopoulos et al., 2018). Besides, H2 can also be in-situ produced on the electrodes, supplying electrons for microbes growing on the cathode, enhancing the electron transfer efficiency. When H2 is used as ED, carbon sources are necessary for MCCs production. Carbon sources including CO2 (Jabeen and Farooq, 2016; Raes et al., 2017; Jourdin et al., 2018), acetate (Steinbusch et al., 2011; Van Eerten-Jansen et al., 2013) and mixed SCCs in biomass fermentation broth (Andersen et al., 2015) were upgraded into MCCs utilizing the in-situ produced H2 from cathode in bioelectrochemical systems as ED. While CO can serve as both ED and carbon source for MCCs production. When CO is used as sole substrate, CO was firstly fixed into acetate and ethanol, and then converted into MCCs with CO-derived electrons by the co-culture of Clostridium autoethanogenum and Clostridium kluyveri (Spirito et al., 2014; Diender et al., 2019). Besides, CE of acetate into MCCs was also achieved utilizing CO as ED (Diender et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2020)."
7,Reducing metals,"3.5 Reducing metals Reducing metals like zero-valence iron (Fe0) and ferrous ion (Fe2+) have the potential to serve as ED for MCCs production. Anaerobic corrosion of Fe0 may induce the formation of H2, thus serving as ED for CE. While on Fe0 and Fe2+ can also be oxidized to contribute electrons during the fermentation process. Wang et al. (2020b) found that Fe0 addition can significantly enhance the MCCs production by improving the solubilization, hydrolysis, acidification of sludge and the electron transfer efficiency from substrates to products. Fu et al. (2020) also achieved enhanced MCCs production with nano Fe0 addition, but the electron balance analysis showed that total electron recovery efficiency was not promoted by Fe0 addition. Reducing metals like Fe0, Fe(II), As(Ш), Mn(II) have been widely explored as ED source in nitrate reduction processes (Alowitz and Scherer, 2002; Sun et al., 2010, 2018; Liu and Wang, 2019; Pang and Wang, 2021), while a few studies have been conducted concerning the potential application of reducing metals in MCCs production at present. Thus, more researches are required to explore the function of reducing metals in CE process."
8,Co-electron donors,"3.6 Co-electron donors The combination of different EDs as co-EDs could achieve synergistic effect to significantly promote CE process, thus stimulating MCCs production. As the utilization of co-EDs is accompanied with the cooperation of different microbes, co-cultures or mixed cultures are used in the fermentation systems. In ethanol-guided CE processes, excessive ethanol oxidation into acetate is the main process restricting the conversion of ethanol into MCCs. It was found that a proper H2 partial pressure was favorable to ethanol oxidation, and promoting the ethanol-guided CE processes (Grootscholten et al., 2014). The stimulated MCCs production with co-EDs of ethanol and H2 comparing with fermentation groups with sole ED was observed (Steinbusch et al., 2011; Yin et al., 2017). Besides, the co-ED of ethanol and methanol also promoted MCCs production with the odd-chain MCCs formation (Saadoun et al., 2021). In lactate-guided CE processes, carbon flow from lactate to MCCs is low due to the CO2 releasement and propionate formation through acrylate pathway (Zhu et al., 2015; Kucek et al., 2016a). Studies found that the supplementation of H2 could significantly enhance the lactate conversion efficiency and MCCs production. the supplementation of H2 could contribute to the lactate-guided CE processes from two aspects. Firstly, H2 could react with the released CO2, forming acetate and ethanol to be further converted in MCCs. Secondly, H2 can reduce the formed propionate into propanol, which can serve as ED for CE process, transforming the lactate-carbon flux from the competing acrylate pathway into heptylate (C7). Wu et al. (2019b) enhanced the carbon flow from lactate to MCCs by 28.4% with H2 supplementation. Besides, ethanol-guided CE can also release H2 during the fermentation process, which can be used to enhance the lactate conversion. Thus, promoted MCCs production was achieved with the co-EDs of ethanol and lactate (Wu et al., 2018). It was also found that the combination of lactate, ethanol and H2 could significantly enhance MCCs production from food waste (Nzeteu et al., 2018)."
9,Substrates for MCCs production,"Substrates used for MCCs production provides carbon sources for MCCs production. Wide ranges of substances can serve as substrate for MCCs production. For example, various SCCs can be directly used as EA for CE; some wastewaters contain alcohols or lactate can provide ED for CE; complex biomass and organic wastes can be hydrolyzed and converted to saccharides, alcohols and SCCs, serving as potential EA and ED source; gaseous carbon sources like CO and CO2 can be synthesized into acetate and ethanol to be further elongated in CE process. Fig. 2 summarizes the potential substrate sources for MCCs production, and the possible conversion routes from different substrate sources to EA and ED."
10,Short-chain carboxylates (SCCs),"4.1 Short-chain carboxylates (SCCs) The reported SCCs capable of serving as EA include acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, malonate and succinate (Kenealy and Waselefsky, 1985; Wu et al., 2018). Table 1 shows MCCs production from SCCs through CE. As shown in Table 1, acetate is the most widely used EA, and the produced MCCs is dominated by caproate (C6). Both ED and inoculum source have great impact on MCCs production. Studies adopted ethanol as ED and C. kluyveri as inoculum all showed higher MCCs production than others, highest caproate (C6) production of 184.48 mM was obtained from the co-EA of acetate and butyrate using ethanol as ED. Comparingly, MCCs production using CO, methanol and glycerol as ED rarely exceeded 10 mM. Besides ED and inoculum source, the composition of MCCs is also greatly affected by EA compositions. Even-chain carboxylic acids like caproate (C6) and caprylate (C8) were produced when acetate and butyrate were used as EA, while odd-chain carboxylic acids like heptylate (C7) was only observed in groups using propionate (C3) as EA. Some studies have compared MCCs production from different SCCs to figure out the optimal EA for CE. Weimer and Stevenson (2012) conducted MCCs production by C. kluyveri taking ethanol as ED, found that acetate was more favorable for caproate (C6) production comparing with propionate, butyrate, malonate, and succinate, and highest caproate (C6) production of 110 mM was achieved. While Liu et al. (2020) studied MCCs production by Eubacterium limosum taking CO as ED, and found that butyrate was more favorable than acetate as EA for caproate (C6) production, and highest caproate (C6) production of 7.7 mM was achieved. Esquivel-Elizondo et al. (2021) conducted CE by Caproiciproducens sp. 7D4C2 using fructose as ED, butyrate was observed to be the optimal EA for MCCs production comparing with acetate, propionate, valerate and caproate (C6). Wu et al. (2018) explored the MCCs production from different EAs and EDs by mixed cultures, similar MCCs production from acetate and butyrate was observed, while the co-EAs of acetate, butyrate, and caproate (C6) showed significant higher MCCs generation when either ethanol or lactate was used as ED. The optimal EA obtained in different studies varied a lot, indicating that EA compositions, ED sources and inoculum sources are interacted on each other. Thus, multi-factor optimization would be necessary to achieve an optimal MCCs production."
11,Biomass and saccharides,"4.2 Biomass and saccharides Biomass refer to the lignocellulose-based materials, mainly include the agricultural residuals, animal manure and stillage. Biomass has been used as a potential fuel source for its high abundance. Biomass has been widely explored as substrate for bioethanol, biodiesel, biomethane and biohydrogen production (Yang and Wang, 2017b; Wang and Yin, 2018, 2018b). The conversion of biomass into MCCs comprises a few steps. Biomass is firstly hydrolyzed into various saccharides, like xylose, glucose, fructose, sucrose and cellulose. Then, the formed saccharides are further converted into SCCs or alcohols for the subsequent CE process. Table 2 summarizes the MCCs production from biomass and various saccharides. Since both SCCs and alcohols can be potentially produced from biomass and saccharides, biomass and saccharides can provide both EA and ED for CE. As shown in Table 2, when saccharides, agricultural residuals and animal manure is used as substrate, ED is from either the exogenous addition or in-situ production, which is determined by if the inoculum is capable of producing alcohols or hydrogen from saccharides or biomass. While when stillage is used as substrate, indigenous alcohols and in-situ produced alcohols can serve as ED. Caproate (C6) shows to be the dominant product in these studies, indicating SCCs produced from biomass acidification are dominated by even-chain acids, like acetate and butyrate. To achieve an efficient conversion of complex biomass, the cooperation is usually needed by different microbes, such as for biomass hydrolysis, acidification, and CE. As shown in Table 2, mixed cultures are widely used as inoculum, including anaerobic sludge, ruminal microbes and the indigenous microbes present in substrate. In some studies, C. kluyveri was added in the mixed cultures to strengthen the CE process. The advantages of using biomass as substrate for MCCs production include: (1) The high abundance of biomass ensures the adequate and consistent supply of substrate for large-scale MCCs production; (2) By adjusting the inoculum source, both EA and ED can be obtained from biomass. However, most biomass are lignocellulose-based materials, the low hydrolysis rate directly restricts the subsequent CE efficiency. As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, MCCs yield from biomass is much lower than MCCs production from SCCs. Thus, enhancing the conversion of biomass to SCCs is the key to enhance the conversion of biomass to MCCs. Potential measurements can be taken include biomass pretreatment and hydrolysis conditions optimization."
12,Organic waste,"4.3 Organic waste Organic waste can be used for sustainable MCCs production, and great environmental benefits can be attained. MCCs production from organic waste can obtain the dual benefits of wastes management and value-added chemicals production. Similar to biomass, conversion of organic waste to MCCs also comprises a few steps, including SCCs formation and CE processes. Table 3 summarizes the MCCs production from organic waste. It can be seen that organic waste used for MCCs mainly include sewage sludge, food waste and municipal solid waste. 4.3.1 Sewage sludge Sewage sludge is generated during the process of biological wastewater treatment. The amount of sewage sludge increased dramatically with the increasing sewage treatment capacity (Yang et al., 2015). Due to the large amount, high water content and high treatment cost of sewage sludge, sludge management has become can environmental problem. As sewage sludge is mainly composed of microorganisms, the high organic content makes sewage sludge a potential substrate for biochemicals generation, like biomethane, biohydrogen, SCCs as well as MCCs (Zhang and Angelidaki, 2015). For the production of MCCs, sewage sludge can serve as EA source, exogenous EDs are necessary. Two-stage fermentation has been used to achieve efficient sludge acidification and the subsequent CE. As shown in Table 3, ethanol has been added as ED for CE. Mixed cultures are adopted as inoculum, which is because sewage sludge is rich in microbes and the compositions of sewage sludge are complex. The products of CE are mixed MCCs comprising caproate (C6), heptylate (C7) and caprylate (C8). The high diversity of products is due to the high diversity of SCCs produced in the acidification process. The advantages of using sewage as substrate for MCCs production include: (1) sewage sludge is rich in various nutrients necessary for microbial metabolism, like metal ions, nitrogen and phosphorous (Wang and Yin, 2018b); (2) sewage sludge can serve as inoculum source for both acidification process and CE process (Wu et al., 2020b, 2020c); (3) SCCs production from sewage sludge has been widely studied, providing references for efficient sludge acidification (Fang et al., 2020). The disadvantages of taking sewage as substrate for MCCs production include: (1) exogenous EDs are necessary for the CE; (2) complex microbial communities may introduce the competing reactions over acidification and CE processes; (3) The product selectivity still need to be improved. Research of MCCs production from sewage sludge is a few at present. More studies are needed to overcome the drawbacks and further improvement of MCCs production from sewage sludge. 4.3.2 Food waste Food waste is the contaminated, degraded, or discharged material that supposed to be consumed by humans. Due to the perishability of food products, inefficiencies in supply and consumer behavior, significant amount of food waste is generated from food processing industries (Zhang et al., 2016). Food waste is composed of plant-based and animal-based materials, like cereals, rice, vegetables, rice, meat by-product, cheese and milk etc. Being rich in carbohydrates and protein, food waste has been widely used as substrate in bioprocesses. As summarized in Table 3, food waste can provide both EDs and EAs for MCCs production, both lactate and ethanol can be in-situ produced to serve as ED for CE. Mixed cultures have been used as inoculum, and the products are dominated by caproate (C6). As the composition of food waste varies a lot with different sources, MCCs yield varies greatly in different studies. The advantages of taking food waste as substrate for MCCs production include: (1) Food waste can be more easily hydrolyzed comparing with lignocellulosic biomass and sewage sludge; (2) Both EA and ED can be obtained from food waste; (3) MCCs production can be achieved in single-phase anaerobic fermentation, making the reactor design and operation easier. The drawbacks of food waste include: (1) perishability of food waste increases the difficulty of transportation and storage; (2) high variety of food waste from different sources and in different seasons may affect the stable operation of reactors. In spite of the drawbacks, food waste is still a good substrate for MCCs production, which is worth more studies to enhance the MCCs production. 4.3.3 Municipal solid waste Municipal solid waste is a kind of mixed waste containing food waste and yard waste (like leaves,). Grootscholten et al. (2013, 2014) achieved MCCs production from municipal solid waste using exogenous ethanol as ED, and indigenous microbes as inoculum (Table 3). Similar to biomass and sewage sludge, MCCs production rate from municipal solid waste is also limited by the hydrolysis process."
13,Wastewater,"4.4 Wastewater Wastewater containing ED or EA can also be used as substrate for MCCs production. Table 4 summarizes MCCs production from various wastewater, including ethanol-containing wastewater (like liquor-making wastewater, beer wasteater), dairy wastewater, biodiesel wastewater and municipal solid waste leachate. The ethanol-containing wastewater, like liquor-making wastewater, beer wastewater contains SCCs, ethanol, polysaccharides and protein, which can be directly used as substrate with no need for exogenous EA or ED supplementation. During the single-phase fermentation, SCCs were accumulated with the acidification of polysaccharides, then MCCs were formed along with ethanol consumption. The CE process terminates with the completion of polysaccharides, protein and alcohols (Wu et al., 2020c). Caproate (C6), heptylate (C7), and caprylate (C8) concentrations of 12.33 g COD/L, 1.89 g COD/L and 2.83 g COD/L were obtained (Wu et al., 2018). In addition, MCCs production rate achieved 31.12 g COD/L/d in a long-term MCCs production reactor in which liquor -making wastewater was used as substrate (Wu et al., 2020a). Dairy wastewater is the acid whey from the manufacture of milk products like yogurt and cheese. Dairy wastewater contains sugars (like lactose, galactose etc.), lactate, protein and ethanol in some cases (Brodowski et al., 2020), which can serve as EA and ED source for MCCs production, with caproate (C6) as main product. Duber et al. (2018) and Brodowski et al. (2020) achieved caproate (C6) production rate of 27.59 mmol/L/d and 133.36 mmol/L/d from dairy wastewater in the single-phase fermentation reactor, while Xu et al. (2018) achieved MCCs and caproate (C6) production rate of 111 mmol/L/d and 81 mmol/L/d from greek-yogurt waste stream using a two-phase fermentation system. Dairy wastewater induced the highest MCCs production among all the reviewed wastewater sources. Biodiesel wastewater is the byproduct of biodiesel production, which is mainly composed of crude glycerol. As discussed in section 3.1, glycerol can be converted into ethanol and SCCs, supplying both EA and ED for MCCs production. However, Leng et al. (2017) found that caproate (C6) production was low when glycerol was used as sole ED, and the addition of ethanol significantly increased caproate (C6) yield. As shown in Table 4, exogenous ethanol is usually used as supplementary ED for MCCs production from glycerol-containing wastewater. The disposal of waste in landfills can form the leachate containing organic compounds and minerals. Saadoun et al. (2021) conducted MCCs production utilizing municipal solid waste leachate as EA source and inoculum source. The study found that MCCs production was highly affected by leachate age: fresh leachate was rich in sulfate, which can inhibit the CE process, while old leachate had low SCCs and degradable matters due to the long-term fermentation. Highest MCCs concentration of 10 g/L was obtained from young leachate."
14,Gaseous substrates,"4.5 Gaseous substrates CO, CO2 can serve as gaseous carbon sources for MCCs production, while CO and H2 can serve as ED for MCCs production as given in section 3.4. Syngas is a good source of CO, CO2 and H2. Syngas can be obtained from the gasification of coal and recalcitrant biomass (Han et al., 2019). Thus, 100% biomass conversion is potentially applicable by combining traditional biomass fermentation, recalcitrant biomass gasification and syngas fermentation. Table 5 summarizes the MCCs production from gaseous substrates. Esquivel-Elizondo et al. (2018) conducted ethanol fermentation in the presence of CO, the study showed that both ethanol and CO served as acetate source and electron source for caproate (C6) production. In addition, CO also showed inhibitory effect on methanogenesis, which is the inhibitory process of CE. For the studies on converting CO2 to MCCs, electrolysis cells were used as the reactor, and anode served as electron source. During the fermentation, CO2 was fixed into acetate by homoacetogens, and the acetate was either used as EA or reduced to ethanol and serve as ED for CE. Besides, H2 could also be produced from the electrode to serve as ED. Acetate is usually added to reduce the lag time and increase the MCCs production rate. Grimalt-Alemany et al. (2018) conducted syngas fermentation for ethanol and carboxylic acids production, highest ethanol yield of 59.15% (electron conversion efficiency) was achieved, accompanied with caproate (C6) of 3.33%. Gildemyn et al. (2017) and Vasudevan et al. (2014) used syngas fermentation effluent as substrate for MCCs production. During the fermentation, ethanol and carboxylic acids present in the effluent served as ED and EA for CE, caproate (C6) productions of 2.19 mM and 8.62 mM were achieved by C. kluyveri and mixed cultures, respectively."
15,Microorganisms for CE,
16,Pure cultures,"5.1 Pure cultures Several wild-type strains that are capable of elongating chain have been isolated and characterized. The reported strains are from genus Clostridium, Caproiciproducens, Megasphaera, Eubacterium, and Ruminococcaceae. Table 6 summarized the information of the reported strains, including the strain designation, origin, growth conditions (pH and temperature), pertinent tested ED, main MCCs produced, optimum caproate (C6) concentration and strain collection. More detailed information is given as follows. 5.1.1 Genus Clostridium Clostridium is most widely detected and used microorganisms in dark fermentative hydrogen production (Wang and Yin, 2021). Clostridium kluyveri is widely studied for CE. C. kluyveri K1 was firstly isolated from canal mud (Barker and Taha, 1942) and has been taken as the model strain for CE process. Strain K1 has been widely used for MCCs production for its wide substrate range, like acetate (Yin et al., 2017), propionate (Candry et al., 2020a), succinate (Kenealy and Waselefsky, 1985) and mixed acids and alcohols in syngas fermentation effluent (Gildemyn et al., 2017). Weimer and Stevenson (2012) isolated a new strain C. kluyveri 3231B from bovine rumen, which showed huge potential for industrial application with pretty wide pH and temperature ranges, wider range of ED source and high caproate (C6) production (12.8 g/L) ability of unadapted cultures. Moreover, a new strain C. kluyveri N6 was isolated from the fermented pit muds (Hu et al., 2015), which could produce caproate (C6), caprylate (C8), and their corresponding ethyl esters. Besides being used in pure-culture fermentation systems, C. kluyveri is also used in open culture CE processes, like the mixed culture of C. kluyveri and C. autoethanogenum for MCCs production from syngas (Diender et al., 2019), co-culture of C. kluyveri and mixed rumen microbes for MCCs production from cellulosic biomass (Weimer et al., 2015), and the bioaugmentation of digested sludge with C. kluyveri for MCCs production from mixed acids and sugars (Zagrodnik et al., 2020). Furthermore, C. kluyveri is also widely found to become dominant in fermentation systems producing MCCs (Steinbusch et al., 2011; Coma et al., 2016; Leng et al., 2017). 5.1.2 Genus Caproiciproducens Caproiciproducens galactitolivorans BS-1 was firstly isolated by Jeon et al. (2010), which was named as Clostridium sp. BS-1. Then, Kim et al. (2015) renamed is as Caproiciproducens galactitolivorans according to its phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics. Caproiciproducens galactitolivorans BS-1 could utilize D-glucose, D-fructose, L-ribose, L-arabinose, L-galactose, D-mannose, D-xylose, glycerol, glucosamine, dulcitol, D-cellobiose, L-fucose, D-tagatose, starch and glycogen and as substrate, producing H2, acetate, butyrate and caproate (C6) as dominant metabolic products (Kim et al., 2015). When D-galactitol is used as substrate, caproate (C6) could be efficiently produced, and the production can be further enhanced through medium optimization and products extraction, and the highest caproate (C6) production of 6.96 g/L was achieved. In addition, caproate (C6) concentration was further increased to 32 g/L through the in-situ extractive fermentation (Jeon et al., 2013). Caproiciproducens sp. 7D4C2 was isolated from mixed cultures in a long-term operating CE reactor, which was started by mixed liquor from butyrate-producing reactor inoculated by rumen fluid and anaerobic sludge. Strain 7D4C2 could utilize hexose to produce acetate, lactate, butyrate, caproate (C6) and H2/CO2. pH (in range of 4.5-5.0) was more favorable for caproate (C6) production by strain 7D4C2. When fructose was used as sole substrate, 57.5±2.4 mmol C/L caproate (C6) was produced with a specificity of 60.9±1.5%. Caproate (C6) production could be enhanced with the addition of butyrate as EA, achieving 125.5±1.9 mmol C/L and a specificity of 83.1±0.44%, while the addition of acetate or propionate as EA could diminish caproate (C6) production and reduce the specificity. Through the in-line product extraction, caproate (C6) production was further enhanced to 314.1±2.1 mmol C/L (Esquivel-Elizondo et al., 2021). Caproicibacter fermentans EA1 was isolated from an anaerobic enrichment culture producing organic acids (acetate, butyrate and caproate), which represents a novel genus and novel species within the family Oscillospiraceae. Strain EA1 could utilize several saccharides, like cellobiose, fructose, galactose, glucosamine, glucose, mannitol, mannose, starch and sucrose to produce acetate, butyrate, caproate (C6), lactate, ethanol, and H2/CO2. When 19 mmol/L fructose was used as sole substrate, 3 mmol/L caproate (C6) was produced (Flaiz et al., 2020). 5.1.3 Genus Megasphaera Genus Megasphaera was widely reported to be capable of utilizing saccharides and lactate to produce MCCs. However, genus Megasphaera was rarely detected in lactate-guided mixed-culture fermentation systems. Duber et al. (2018) observed the diminishment of genus Megasphaera during the acid whey fermentation process. On the other side, Straeuber et al. (2018) explored the MCCs production by maize silage fermentation, and found that lactic acid production was significantly inhibited by Fe(OH)3 and Mg(OH)2, which was accompanied with the increase of MCCs production and the abundance of genus Megasphaera. Indicating genus Megasphaer was not competitive in lactate-guided mixed-culture fermentation systems, but can become prevalent in solid-state fermentation of ensiled crops. Megasphaera hexanoica MH T was firstly isolated from a cow rumen, which was identified to be a novel species of genus Megasphaera (Jeon et al., 2016, 2017). Strain MHT could utilize fructose to produce various SCCs (C2-C5), low concentrations of MCCs (C6-C8) and H2/CO2. The addition of EA (like acetate, propionate and butyrate) could significantly increase MCCs production and cell growth. Production of 9.7 g/L caproate (C6), 3.2 g/L of heptylate (C7) and 1.2 g/L caprylate (C8) was achieved with the supplementation of C2–C6 carboxylic acids as the EAs (Jeon et al., 2016). Through the co-fermentation of strain MHT and C. tyrobutyricum, enhanced caproate (C6) production of 10.08 g/L along with the highest production rate of 0.69 g/L/h was achieved. Besides, strain MHT also displayed excellent ability of producing odd-chain carboxylic acids (Kim et al., 2018, 2019). Megasphaera elsdenii was originally isolated from rumen of sheep (M. elsdenii LC3), which can utilize lactate and various sugars to produce SCCs, caproate (C6) (Elsden et al., 1956). When glucose is used as sole substrate, products are dominated by butyrate (Marounek et al., 1989), while the supplementation of SCCs and products extraction could significantly enhance the production of caproate (C6). Choi et al. (2013) increased caproate (C6) production in sucrose based medium from 4.69 g/L to 8.19 g/L and 28.42 g/L with the addition of butyrate and extraction solvent, while the addition of SCCs had no obvious influence on caproate (C6) generation when lactate was used as feedstock. In addition, M. elsdenii was also reported to be capable of producing caproate (C6) in the fermentation of stillage and energy crops (Andersen et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2020). The utilization of Jerusalem artichoke tubers biomass as feedstock significantly decreased caproate (C6) production cost comparing with taking sucrose as substrate or petroleum-derived caproate (C6) cost (Kim et al., 2020). Megasphaera indica NMBHI-10T and BLPYG-7 were isolated from human faeces. Both strains were capable of producing caproate (C6) as main product from wide range of carbohydrates, like glucose, lactose, cellobiose, rhamnose, galactose and sucrose (Lanjekar et al., 2014). 5.1.4 Genus Eubacterium Eubacterium pyruvativorans I-6T was isolated from ruminal fluid from a sheep, which could produce caproate (C6) as the main fermentation product from pyruvate or trypticase, but cannot utilize sugars (Wallace, 2003). In addition, the strain could not survive when heating at 80°C for 10 min (Wallace, 2003). The presence of acetate, propionate and butyrate increased the microbial growth of strain when pancreatic casein was used as sole carbon source. Labelling experiments showed that the strain could couple two carbon atoms to acetate, propionate and butyrate to form butyrate, valerate and caproate (C6) (Wallace et al., 2004). Thus, E. pyruvativorans could contribute to MCCs production in protein-rich conditions. Eubacterium limosum was isolated from sheep rumen, sewage sludge and young calf. Eubacterium limosum could utilize various alcohols (like methabol, adonitol, arabitol, mannitol and erythritol), sugars (like fructose and glucose), amino acids (like isoleucine, ribose and valine), lactate and syngas (H2, CO, and CO2) as energy sources. Acetate was required for microbial growth on valine, and it could stimulate the microbial growth on glucose. Nevertheless, it was unnecessary for microbial growth on H2-CO2 (Genthner et al., 1981). Acetate and butyrate were the main products from H2-CO2, and caproate (C6) could be produced from methanol. Lindley et al. (1987) found that caproate (C6) production from methanol could be stimulated through the supplementation of butyrate. However, due to the low caproate (C6) selectivity, E. limosum has been more widely used for butyrate production from syngas comparing with MCCs production (Park et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2021). In consideration of its capability of converting syngas into SCCs, E. limosum could contribute to MCCs production by synergistically cultivated with other CE microbes that can convert SCCs into MCCs. Besides, E. limosum also capability of degrading glycerol through the co-culture of E. limosum and C. kluyveri (Leng et al., 2019). 5.1.5 Ruminococcaceae bacterium Ruminococcaceae bacterium has been widely detected in both ethanol- and lactate- guided mixed-culture fermentation system (Straeuber et al., 2018; Duber et al., 2018; Nzeteu et al., 2018). Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 was firstly isolated from microbiome capable of producing caproate (C6) from lactate. The strains prefers acidic initial pH 5.0-6.5, and can achieve high-rate caproate (C6) production at 30-40°C (Zhu et al., 2017). The strain could utilize lactate as ED for MCCs production, and the supplementation of SCCs and sucrose could significantly stimulate both microbial growth and MCCs production. Through the medium optimization, highest caproate (C6) concentration of 16.73 g/L was achieved using a medium containing 22.35 g/L lactate, 16.48 g/L butyrate, and 13.30 g/L sucrose (Wang et al., 2018). The high caproate (C6) production capability and selectivity indicates that Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 has potential application in large-scale caproate (C6) production (Tao et al., 2017)."
17,Mixed cultures,"5.2 Mixed cultures With the extension of substrate sources for MCCs production, especially when complex biomass and organic wastes are applied as feedstock, mixed cultures are widely used. Firstly, the complex compositions of substrate require the cooperation of different microbes, like the microbes responsible for biomass hydrolysis, SCCs production and CE processes (Diender et al., 2019). Secondly, mixed cultures are more resistant to fluctuate conditions, thus facilitating a more stable function of fermentation system during long-term operation (Vasudevan et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2019c). Thirdly, it is unrealistic to main the pure-culture fermentation when actual wastes are used as substrate. Mixed cultures for CE can be obtained from wide range of sources, like sewage sludge (Wu et al., 2020b, 2020c), pit-mud (Wu et al., 2019b), leachate (Nzeteu et al., 2018), rumen fluid (Weimer et al., 2015) and stillage (Scarborough et al., 2018). For MCCs production, pretreatment or acclimation process is usually needed to enrich the functional microbes and inhibit the competing microbes in mixed cultures. For example, Wu et al. (2020b, 2020c) conducted alkaline fermentation to enrich acids-producing microbes in sewage sludge. Wu et al. (2020a) acclimated the microbial structure by adding BES as methanogens inhibitors, gradually increasing organic loading rate from 4.18 to 28.55 g COD/(L·d) and optimizing operational conditions in sequence, a long-term MCCs production was achieved. The microbial structure can be affected by inoculum source, substrate source, and ED. Table 7 summarized the dominant microorganisms detected in the mixed-culture fermentation systems. It can be seen that the dominant microbial structures are significantly different in ethanol- and lactate-guided fermentation systems. For ethanol-guided fermentation systems, Clostridium spp. are widely examined, while for lactate-guided fermentation systems, lactate-utilizing strains like Megasphaera spp. and Caproiciproducens spp. (Candry et al., 2020a; Contreras-Davila et al., 2020) are more widely examined. Besides, substrate sources also have great effect on the dominant microbial structure. When SCCs are used as EA, CE strains are more dominant present, while when biomass is used as EA source, microbes favoring in biomass hydrolysis like Acinetobacter spp., Bacillus spp., Escherichia spp. and Enterococcus spp., and microbes that are in charge of SCCs production like acetogenicbacteria and C. butyricum, could become dominant along with CE strains. For the systems using gases substrates, 2-carbon synthesis microbes like C. ljungdahlii, C. ragsdalei, C. carboxidivorans, and Eubacterium limosum are dominantly present in the systems."
18,Influencing factors,
19,Effect of temperature,"6.1 Effect of temperature Temperature could affect the microbial activity and MCCs production. Reactors operating at the optimal growth temperature ranges for CE microbes could facilitate the high microbial activity. In addition, it is widely accepted that the microbial reacting rate increases with the increase of temperature in an appropriate range. Wu et al. (2020a) found that when temperature rose from 35 °C to 40 °C, MCCs concentration increased from 5.41 g COD/L to 5.76 g COD/L, however, it decreased when temperature further increased to 45 °C or decreased to 30 °C and 25 °C. The optimal growth temperature is in the range of 37–39 °C for many CE microbes, like C. kluyveri, E. pyruvativorans, E. limosum, and M. elsdenii etc."
20,Effect of pH,"6.2 Effect of pH pH is another important factor affecting the microbial activities. For the fermentation systems targeting to produce MCCs, pH affects the reactor performance from the following aspects: (1) pH can affect the activities and metabolism pathways of CE microbes Yu et al. (2019) studied the caproate (C6) production at pHs from 5.5 to 9.5, found that caproate (C6) production increased from 2.3 g/L to 14.9 g/L when pH increased from 5.5 to 7.5, but it seriously suppressed to 1.06 g/L and 0.55 g/L when pH further increased to 8.5 and 9.5. The optimal pH for MCCs production is at near neutrality (Kenealy et al., 1995; San-Valero et al., 2020). Caproate (C6) could be generated at pH 5.5 and 7, while caprylate (C8) was only generated at pH 7 (Steinbusch et al., 2011). MCCs production by C. kluyeri was found ceased when pH of the fermentation system was decreased to pH 5.5 (Gildemyn et al., 2017). By contrast, mixed cultures were more resistant to acidic pH condition (Vasudevan et al., 2014). (2) pH can affect the activity of methanogens, which are competing microbes of CE microbes. Wu et al. (2020a) found that with the decrease of pH from 6.5 to 5.4, methane production was significantly decreased with the gradual improvement of MCCs production. When pH was kept at 5.4, no methane was detected and MCCs concentration was 6.38 ± 0.17 g COD/L, which was about 10.76% higher than that at pH 6.5. (3) pH can affect the dissolution equilibrium of volatile fatty acids. It was found that undissociated acids is the main component for microbial inhibition in CE. Threshold concentration of undissociated caproate (C6) was reported to be 7.5 mM, beyond which the undissociated caproate (C6) would poison the CE process (Ge et al., 2015). (4) pH can affect the dissociation state of CO2 (H2CO3/CO2, HCO3 -, CO3 2-). Firstly, H2CO3/CO2 serves as an important carbon source for CE microbes like C. kluyveri (Tomlinson and Barker, 1954). Besides, HCO3 - could serve as buffer agent, addition of which increased the caproate (C6) production up to 21.4 g/L (San-Valero et al., 2020)."
21,Effect of ED/EA ratio,"6.3 Effect of ED/EA ratio The proper ED/EA ratio is considered an essential factor for driving fermentation processes toward MCCs conversion. Liu et al. (2016) reported that ED was sufficient for CE when ED/EA ratio was over 2:1, but studies found that MCCs production could be promoted with the increase of ED/EA ratio in an appropriate range. For MCCs production from ethanol and acetate, when it increased from 1:2 to 2:1, MCCs production increased from 2.88 g /L to 5.28 g /L (Wu et al., 2020b). When it ratio rose from 3:1 to 5:1, MCCs production increased from 5.57 g /L to7.67 g /L (Wu et al., 2020a). Caproate (C6) production of 7.9 g /L and 8.42 g/L were obtained with ratio of 10:1(Yin et al., 2017; Cavalcante et al., 2020). In addition to the promotion of MCCs production, higher ED/EA ratio could also promote the formation of longer-chain MCCs and product selectivity. Kucek et al. (2016b) reported an increased caprylate (C8) to caproate (C6) ratio with the increased of ED/EA ratio from 7.8-19.6. Hegner et al. (2017) observed higher selective production of caproate (C6) than butyrate (C4) when ED/EA ratio was increased from 1.32 to 3.25, and Spirito et al. (2018) reported highest specificity for caproate (C6) production at ED/EA ratio of 6.7. Although the abundant ethanol may boost the MCCs production, much high ethanol would inhibit the microbial activity. Yin et al. (2017) reported an increased optimal caproate (C6) production from 3.11 g/L to 8.42 g/L with 10 times ethanol addition (500 mM) as substrate, while with the further increase of ethanol concentration to 800 mM, caproate (C6) production decreased to 4.93 g/L, and caproate (C6) production ceased when ethanol concentration reached 1000 mM. The optimal ethanol to acetate ratio was widely reported to be around 3. For example, Leng et al. (2017), Wu et al. (2022) and Liu et al. (2016) reported optimal ethanol/acetate ratio of 3:1 to obtain the maximum caproate (C6) production, while Yin et al. (2017) reported an optimal ethanol/acetate ratio of 7:3 to achieve the highest caproate (C6) production when the total carbon source was controlled at 100 mM. Besides, the optimal ED/EA ratio is also affected by the ED and EA sources. For MCCs production from glycerol and acetate, the optimal ED/EA ratio was determined to be 4 (Leng et al., 2017), for MCCs production from ethanol and propionate, the optimal ED/EA ratio was determined to be 2.4 (Candry et al., 2020a), for MCCs production from ethanol, acetate and butyrate, the optimal ED/EA ratio was determined to be 4 (Yu et al., 2019), and for MCCs production from lactate and acetate, the optimal ED/EA ratio was determined to be 2 (Wu et al., 2022)."
22,Effect of partial pressure,"6.4 Effect of partial pressure 6.4.1 H2 partial pressure H2 could facilitate MCCs production from the following aspects: (1) H2 could provide reducing equivalent for CE, like the conversion of CO2 to SCCs and alcohols, and the subsequent upgrade of SCCs to MCCs (Steinbusch et al., 2011; Andersen et al., 2015; Raes et al., 2017). (2) H2 could inhibit the oxidation of excessive ethanol, which is the competing process of CE. It has been reported that a H2 partial pressure of ≥14% could suppress the excessive ethanol oxidation, thus enhancing the ethanol conversion to MCCs (Roghair et al., 2018a). (3) H2 could enhance the electron transfer efficiency during CE. Wu et al. (2019b) reported a ~28.4% enhancement of lactate-carbon flow for MCCs production. Nzeteu et al. (2018) also reported an enhanced caproate (C6) production rate with the supplementation of H2 at 0.5 bar. (4) H2 could stimulate the formation of longer-chain fatty acids like heptylate (C7) and caprylate (C8). It was found that caprylate (C8) production from acetate and ethanol was improved when 200 mL/h H2 was continuously flushed to serve ED (Steinbusch et al., 2011). However, it is worth noting that in the CE systems using ethanol as ED, the high H2 partial pressure may limit the ethanol oxidation, thus reducing the ethanol conversion efficiency (Roghair et al., 2018a; Wu et al., 2021). Hydrogen partial pressure below 0.03 bar is required to enable the ethanol oxidation (Grootscholten et al., 2014). Thus, a proper H2 pressure is crucial for the stimulation of MCCs production in different CE systems. 6.4.2 CO partial pressure CO could serve as both carbon source and reducing equivalents for CE process. Hurst 2010 studied the effect of CO partial pressure on syngas fermentation, found that both microbial growth and ethanol formation were increased with the increase of CO partial pressure from 0.35 to 2.9 atm. Jack et al. (2019) also reported the preference of more reduced metabolites formation with higher CO concentration in the headspace. The abundance of reduced metabolites could provide more reducing equivalents for MCCs production. Diender et al. (2016, 2019) reported the enhanced MCCs production in the presence of CO. Besides serving as substrate, CO also shows inhibitory effect to methanogenesis, which is a vital competing process of CE. Esquivel-Elizondo et al. (2018) found that higher CO partial pressure of over 0.11 atm could inhibit the methanogenesis, which alleviated the carboxylates and ED consumption by methanogens. 6.4.3 CO2 partial pressure CO2 also plays an important role in MCCs production. CO2 may facilitate or impair the CE processes, thus controlling a proper CO2 pressure in the fermentation system is necessary to achieve a high MCCs production. For the facilitation of CE process, it has been demonstrated that CO2 is essential for the anaerobic metabolism of the well established CE strain C. kluyverii (Tomlinson and Barker, 1954). In addition, CO2 may be used to adjust the H2 partial pressure to achieve a satisfying MCCs production. For the fermentation systems rich in ethanol (like the undistilled fermentation broth from the bioethanol industry), high H2 partial pressure may be formed, which could suppress the conversion of ethanol to MCCs, and the supplementation of CO2 could be helpful to relieve the suppression, and stimulate the ethanol upgrading process. For example, Wu et al. (2021) lowered H2 partial pressure by supplying CO2 during the fermentation process, which improved MCCs production by 11.27%. Roghair et al. (2018a) found that when CO2 loading rate was 2.5 L/(L•d), caproate (C6) productivity was 10.8 g/(L•d), which was 3.72 times higher than that obtained at CO2 loading rate of 1 L/(L•d). While on the other hand, abundant CO2 could stimulate the ethanol oxidation process and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, which may induce the waste of EDs, resulting in the low MCCs yield (Wu et al., 2019c). Thus, in fermentation systems targeting to upgrade SCCs, low CO2 loading rate is recommended to minimize the costly ethanol consumption (Roghair et al., 2018a)."
23,Effect of additives,"6.5 Effect of additives Additives have been widely used to enhance the microbial performances in fermentation processes (Yang and Wang, 2018). In MCCs production, various additives were explored to stimulate the CE process by promoting the microbial growth, stimulating the enzymatic activity and facilitating the metabolic processes. 6.5.1 Yeast extract Yeast extract is a widely used additives in microorganisms-based systems, which could supply necessary nutrients for microbial growth and reproduction. Yeast extract addition was found to be conductive to MCCs production in Clostridium spp. dominated fermentation systems. For example, San-Valero et al. (2020) conducted caproate (C6) production from acetate and butyrate by C. kluyverii, yeast extract played a critical role in microbial reproduction and chain elongation. Microbial growth was significantly restricted with the omission of yeast extract, which induced the decrease of caproate (C6) production. Grimalt-Alemany et al. (2018) performed CE of syngas by mixed cultures, and found that yeast extract addition triggered both the Clostridium spp. dominated biomass reproduction and MCCs production. As acetate and butyrate production from yeast extract was examined, the enhanced MCCs production may come from both the promoted syngas conversion by triggered microbes, and the additionally produced SCCs from yeast extract. Similarly, Yang et al. (2018) also observed enhanced MCCs production from SCCs and ethanol. Microbial analysis showed that Macellibacteroides was significantly enriched in yeast extract added groups, which has been reported to be capable of hydrolyzing macromolecules and SCCs production, indicating the enhanced MCCs production by yeast addition may be contributed by both enriched functional microbes and additional carbon source supplementation. It is worth noting that yeast extract is not necessary for all MCCs-producing systems. For example, Wang et al. (2018) optimized medium composition for MCCs production by Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6, compositions including tryptone, yeast extract, sucrose, butyrate, and lactate were firstly screened, influence of tryptone and yeast extract was determined to be insignificant and excluded from the subsequent optimization. While for the fermentation systems with protein-rich substrate (like sewage sludge, food waste etc.), yeast extract is usually not necessary. 6.5.2 Metal ions Studies found that iron can significantly promote MCCs production. Fu et al. (2020) conducted CE of acetate using ethanol as ED. 0-2 g/L nano Fe0 was added in the fermentation system. Caproate (C6) production increased with the increasing nano Fe0 doses, highest caproate (C6) concentration of 28 mM was obtained, which was 16.7% higher than the control group. Wang et al. (2020b) studied the influence of Fe0 on MCCs production from sewage sludge, they found that the addition of Fe0 (1−20 g/L) could effectively stimulated the production and selectivity of MCCs. MCCs concentration increased from 2.9 g /L (control group) to 15.4 g /L (with addition of 20 g/L Fe0). The stimulated MCCs production by Fe0 addition may be attributed to four aspects: (1) Fe0 could promote the CE process by serving as the electron shuttle, which can increase the electron transfer efficiency from ED to EA (Fu et al., 2020). (2) H2 may be produced with the anaerobic corrosion of Fe0, thus reducing the excess ethanol oxidation, increasing the ethanol conversion to MCCs (Grootscholten et al., 2014). (3) Fe0 could promote the solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification of complex organics, thus providing more SCCs available for CE (Yin and Wang, 2019; Wang et al., 2020b). (4) Fe0 may serve as potential ED source for CE process. Although there is no direct evidence showing that Fe0 could serve as ED source for CE process, the wide application of Fe0 as ED source in nitrate reduction processes (Alowitz and Scherer, 2002; Sun et al., 2010; Su et al., 2018) showed its great potential application in MCCs production. Thus, the potential application of Fe0 as ED source for MCCs production is worth to be further studied. In summary, Fe0 could promote MCCs production by stimulating the SCCs production from complex organics and enhancing the electron transfer during the CE process. 6.5.3 Carbon materials Carbon materials like biochar and activated carbon are also widely explored as additives in the fermentation systems to enhance the system performance. In the fermentation systems targeting to produce MCCs, the addition of carbon materials was reported to capable of promoting the MCCs production, increasing the products selectivity, reducing the lag phase and enhancing the system stability (Liu et al., 2017; Ghysels et al., 2021). For the promotion of MCCs production, carbon materials were reported to work from four aspects. (1) The enhancement of electron transfer efficiency. Liu et al. (2017) reported an enhanced electron transfer from 29.5%-49.2% in control group to 43.4%-68.9% in biochar added group, which promoted caproate (C6) production from 14.4 g/L to 21.1 g/L. (2) The elimination or remission of substrate and products inhibition. Carbon materials could supply rough surfaces and a plenty of pores for microorganisms to grow on, the immobilized microorganisms are more resistant to inhibitions in the fermentation broth. It was reported the microbial attachment onto biochar and activated carbon, while no substrate and products inhibition (Liu et al., 2017; Ghysels et al., 2021). (3) Biochar could serve as pH buffer and nutrients source in the fermentation system (Wang and Wang, 2019). Sun et al. (2020) reported good microbial performance in non-detoxified switchgrass hydrolysate medium using biochar as pH buffer. Sun et al. (2018) found that the minerals and trace metals contained in biochar could enhance the ethanol formation from the syngas fermentation by C. ragsdalei. (4) The promotion of biomass hydrolysis could supply abundant SCCs for subsequent CE. Yang and Wang (2019a) reported the enhanced grass hydrolysis during dark fermentation with the addition of biochar."
24,Strategies for enhancing MCCs production,
25,Strengthening the microbial communities,"7.1 Strengthening the microbial communities The activity of microorganisms in the fermentation system plays a critical role in MCCs production. To promote MCCs production, bioaugmentation, synthetic microbial co-cultures, microbial immobilization and genetic intervention strategies have been applied to strengthen the microbial communities. 7.1.1 Bioaugmentation Bioaugmentation with addition of the specialized microorganism could be a powerful tool to improve the process performance (Wang et al., 2002b; Bai et al., 2011), which was used to improve the MCCs production. When complex organics are used in MCCs production, mixed cultures are more favorable for the practical application. To enhance the capacity of mixed cultures in producing MCCs, reduce the lag time of favorable metabolism, strains that are efficient in CE or SCCs production have been widely used for the bioaugmentation of the mixed fermentation systems. C. kluyveri has been the most widely used CE bacteria for the bioaugmentation of mixed cultures. Weimer et al. (2015) conducted MCCs production using cellulosic biomass and ethanol as substrate, through the bioaugmentation of ruminal microbes with C. kluyveri 3231B, caproate (C6) production was significantly enhanced from 7.8 mM to 52.5 mM. Reddy et al. (2018) performed a two-stage mixed culture fermentation system to convert food waste to SCCs, and then the CE of SCCs with the addition of ethanol. Through the bioaugmentation of mixed cultures with C. kluyveri NBRC 12016 in the second-stage fermentation system, caproate (C6) production of 8.1 g/L was achieved, which was 3.0 times and 7.2 times of caproate (C6) production in non-bioaugmented group and pure C. kluyveri group. However, it seems that bioaugmentation of mixed cultures with C. kluyveri only showed advantage in ethanol-guided CE processes. Zagrodnik et al. (2020) conducted MCCs production from mixed mixed substrates (acetate, ethanol, lactate and lactose), found that lower caproate (C6) production was achieved from C. kluyveri DSM 555 bioaugmented culture than heat-treated digested sludge, because the abundance of C. kluyveri in the inoculum suppressed microbial activity responsible for lactate utilization. In addition, with the quick caproate (C6) production from ethanol and acetate, the accumulation of caproate (C6) in turn inhibited lactate-guided CE processes, which resulted in the low conversion of lactate and lactose. By contrast, the group inoculated by heat-treated digested sludge performed both ethanol-guided and lactate-guided CE processes efficiently, achieved a significant higher caproate (C6) production of 9.06 g/L (vs. 7.67 g/L from bioaugmented group). Besides CE bacteria, strains efficient in SCCs production is also used for the bioaugmentation of mixed cultures to enhance MCCs production. For example, Dams et al. (2018) found that the bioaugmentation with C. acetobutylicum also enhanced caproate (C6) production through providing abundant butyrate for subsequent CE process. 7.1.2 Synthetic microbial co-cultures The synthetic co-cultivation could achieve the thermodynamic interactions in mixed microbes, which can promote the desired conversions. Through the co-culture process, MCCs production is usually enhanced by supplying more readily available EA or ED for CE process. For example, Diender et al. (2019) conducted the MCCs production from syngas, they found that ethanol consumption by C. kluyveri promoted electron transfer from CO to ethanol in C. autoethanogenum, thus enhanced the syngas conversion efficiency and energy yield. Kim et al. (2018) conducted MCCs production from sucrose and fructose by the co-culture of C. tyrobutyricum and M. hexanoica. During the process, C. tyrobutyricum performed efficient conversion of sucrose to butyrate, which supplied abundant EA for CE by M. hexanoica, contributed to efficient MCCs production. In addition, during the fermentation, fructose served as ED, while sucrose was used as EA source instead of more expensive fructose, which enhanced the economic benefits of the fermentation system. 7.1.3 Microbial immobilization Microbial immobilization refers to the fixation of microorganisms or enzymes on a solid support or into a solid matrix (Wang et al., 1995; Wang and Yin, 2019). It was found that the immobilization can facilitate the microbial application by enhancing the microbial stability and enabling the microbial reuse in repeated or continued operation (Wang et al., 1997, 2000a, 2001, 2002a; Zhang et al., 2007; Wang and Chen, 2009; Qiao et al., 2010). For example, Shimada et al. (1996) performed caprylate (C8) production from tuna oil, through the immobilization of Rhizopus delemar lipase by ceramic carrier, the immobilized lipase could be reused 14 times, and around 65% of the fatty acids in the tuna oil were converted into caprylate (C8). Besides, microbial immobilization can also help to relieve the inhibition of products or toxic components in the substrate (Chen et al., 2021a). Wu et al. (2020a) reported the mitigation the toxicity of undissociated MCCs by granule sludge. Roddick and Britz (1997) found that the immobilization of M. elsdenii in κ-carrageenan achieved higher caproate (C6) production of 19 g/L, which was 1.73 times of caproate (C6) production by free cells of M. elsdenii. Zhang et al. (2019) found that immobilized C. kluyveri possesses higher tolerance to high ammonia concentration. The threshold ammonia concentration for MCCs production was enhanced from 2.1 g/L to over 5.0 g/L by immobilizing microorganisms on the wheat straw, and caproate (C6) production was enhanced from 3.7 mM in suspended group to 64.7 mM in immobilized group. In addition, carriers for microbial immobilization also have great effect on microbial performance. Zhang et al. (2019) compared wheat straw, grass straw, and saw dust as carrier for MCCs production, the achieved caproate (C6) production was in the order of: wheat straw>grass straw>saw dust. The best performance of wheat straw immobilized group was due to the large surface area of wheat straw including both outside of profile and inside of the porous structure. 7.1.4 Genetic modification strategies Well-developed genetic intervention strategies include the blocking or deletion of the unfavorable geneses, insertion of target functional genes and molecular modification of certain genes. For example, Benito-Vaquerizo et al. (2020) increased the ethanol productivity to 150% by blocking either formate dehydrogenase or acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity in C. autoethanogenum, and the increased ethanol production further promoted the subsequent caproate (C6) production. In recent years, synthetic biology emerged as a new genetic technology to achieve the cost-effective, and efficient MCCs production. Through the metabolic engineering, microbes like Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are used as the host microorganisms, the triacylglycerols (TAG) profile is changed to increase MCCs flux into TAG backbones for the accumulation of MCCs (Venkateswar et al., 2020). For example, Wu et al. (2019a) engineered E. coli by inserting the pyruvate dehydrogenase from E. faecalis, and rewiring the carbon and energy metabolism in E. coli. The engineered strain achieved MCCs production of 15.67 g/L from glycerol, which was increased by 15.7 times compared with the initial strain."
26,Preventing the competitive processes,"7.2 Preventing the competitive processes During the fermentation, multiple metabolic processes are active in microorganisms. Besides the processes favorable for MCCs production, some processes that competing for substrates or intermediates with CE processes are also included. The presence of competitive processes can reduce the substrate conversion efficiency and MCCs production, impairing the operating efficiency of carboxylate platform. The competitive processes include the processes competing for EDs, like excessive ethanol oxidation, syntrophic ethanol oxidation, acrylate pathway; processes competing for EAs, like anaerobic SCCs oxidation, acetotrophic methanogenesis, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and sulfate-reducing process. 7.2.1 Excessive ethanol oxidation As discussed in section 3.1, when ethanol is used as ED for CE, around 1/6 ethanol is oxidized into acetate to provide metabolic energy (Spirito et al., 2014). However, over 1/6 ethanol oxidation is usually observed, which is termed as excessive ethanol oxidation (Eq. 12). Excessive ethanol oxidation can reduce the electrons transformation and the ethanol conversion efficiency. In addition, the extra acetate produced from ethanol oxidation can also induce the pH decrease, which may affect the CE efficiency. (12) C 2 H 5 OH + H 2 O → CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 Δ G r o = 49.60 kJ / mol To achieve an efficient MCCs production, suppressing excessive ethanol oxidation is necessary for ethanol-guided CE processes. Excessive ethanol oxidation can be avoided or suppressed from three aspects (Grootscholten et al., 2014): (1) Adopting pure culture or co-cultures of microorganisms capable of CE as inoculum for the dark fermentation system; (2) Inhibiting ethanol-oxidizing microorganisms in mixed cultures before the fermentation; (3) Maintaining a proper H2 partial pressure. Methods of selectively inhibiting ethanol-oxidizing microorganisms have been rarely studied. More studies have suppressed excessive ethanol oxidation by adding H2 in the fermentation system. It has been reported that a H2 partial pressure of ≥ 14% can suppress the excessive ethanol oxidation. In addition, Roghair et al. (2018a) found that high caproate (C6) concentration may also inhibit excessive ethanol oxidation. 7.2.2 Syntrophic ethanol oxidation Syntrophic ethanol oxidation is caused by the abundance of CO2 in the fermentation system (Eq. 13), which can also cause the waste of ethanol, thus reducing the MCCs yield. Syntrophic ethanol oxidation can be suppressed through reducing the available CO2 in the fermentation system, which can be achieved by alkali absorption or supplying H2 (Roghair et al., 2018a). (13) C 2 H 5 OH + 0.5 CO 2 → CH 3 COOH + 0.5 CH 4 Δ G r o = ‐ 15.75 kJ / mol 7.2.3 Lactate consumption Lactate consumption mainly include the acrylate pathway through lactate conversion (Eq. 14), and lactate oxidation (Eq. 15) (Candry et al., 2020a). In lactate-guided CE processes, lactate consumption not only reduces the lactate conversion efficiency, propionate formation can also induce the formation of odd-chain MCCs formation, thus reducing the MCCs selectivity. To achieve a high carbon flow from lactate to MCCs, measurements are needed to suppress the lactate consumption processes. Cavalcante et al. (2017) found that lactate consumption can be eliminated by controlling the microorganisms present in the fermentation system. A high caproate (C6) yield was achieved from lactate with no propionate production with pit mud and isolated Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 as inoculum (Zhu et al., 2015, 2017). While fermentation systems with complex microbial distributions, lactate consumption can be limited under lactate-limited conditions. The lactate consumption mainly happened in lactate-rich fermentation systems, controlling the residual lactate concentration in the fermentation system is favorable for lactate consumption suppression and MCCs production (Prabhu et al., 2012). (14) 2 CH 3 CH OH COOH + H 2 O → CH 3 COOH + C 2 H 5 COOH + HCO 3 − 1 + H + + H 2 Δ G r o = ‐ 46.00 kJ / mol (15) CH 3 CH OH COOH + 3 H 2 O → 3 CO 2 + 6 H 2 Δ G r o = 45.50 kJ / mol 7.2.4 Anaerobic SCCs oxidation Through the β-oxidation of SCCs, propionate and butyrate can be oxidized into acetate, H2 and CO2, and acetate can be further oxidized into H2 and CO2 (Eq. 16-18). Anaerobic SCCs oxidation is performed by acetogenic bacteria, which consumes EA for CE, reducing the substrate conversion efficiency to MCCs. (16) C 3 H 7 COOH + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 Δ G r o = 88.20 kJ / mol (17) C 2 H 5 COOH + 2 H 2 O → CH 3 COOH + CO 2 + 3 H 2 Δ G r o = 71.70 kJ / mol (18) CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 Δ G r o = 55.00 kJ / mol Anaerobic SCCs oxidation can be suppressed by inhibiting acetogenic bacteria activity, and preserving a proper H2 partial pressure. Roghair et al. (2018a) found that a H2 partial pressure of >0.007% can make the anaerobic SCCs oxidation thermodynamically infeasible. 7.2.5 Acetotrophic methanogenesis Acetotrophic methanogenesis is ferformed by acetotrophic methanogens, through which acetate is converted into CO2 and CH4 (Eq. 19). Strategies to suppress acetotrophic methanogenesis include: (1) inhibiting or eliminating the methanogens by inoculum pretreatment. Lots of methods have been reported to be capable of inhibiting methanogens like heat-shock, aeration, alkaline treatment etc. (Wang and Yin, 2017). (2) Inhibiting the methanogens activity by controlling the fermentation conditions. Studies have found that slightly acidic condition (5-5.5) can inhibit the acetotrophic methanogenesis process while preserve the CE process (Agler et al., 2012). (3) Inhibiting the methanogens activity by adding chemicals in the fermentation system. Widely used chemicals include 2-Bromoethanesulfonate (BES), chloroform, methyl fluoride, selenium oxyanion and long-chain fatty acids (Cicerone and Oremland, 1988; Hu and Chen, 2007; Lenz et al., 2008; Conrad et al., 2009; Ray et al., 2009; Lins et al., 2015). BES (about 50 mM) has been widely used in inhibiting methanogens in CE (Wu et al., 2020a). In addition, Esquivel-Elizondo et al. (2018) found that higher CO partial pressure of over 0.11 atm could also inhibit the acetotrophic methanogenesis during the CE process. (4) Eliminating methanogens in the fermentation system by adopting a low hydraulic retention time (HRT). Studies found that the slow-growing methanogens could be detached and washed out by applying a combination of a low HRT and sufficient hydraulic shear force (Grootscholten et al., 2013). (19) CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O → CO 2 + CH 4 Δ G r o = 398.70 kJ / mol 7.2.6 Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is performed by hydrogenotrophic methanogens, through which CH4 is synthesized from H2 and CO2. The consumed H2 can serve as ED for CE. In addition, consumption of H2 and CO2 could promote the oxidation of ethanol and acetate, thus impairing the CE process. (20) 2 H 2 + 0.5 CO 2 → 0.5 CH 4 + H 2 O Δ G r o = − 65.35 kJ / mol Studies found that some chemical suppressive to acetotrophic methanogens can also inhibit hydrogenotrophic methanogens, like BES, chloroform and selenium oxyanion (Lenz et al., 2008; Conrad et al., 2009). Besides, hydrogenotrophic methanogens can also be inhibited by free acetic acid (Zhang et al., 2018). 7.2.7 Sulfate-reducing process Sulfate-reducing bacteria can consume various substrates as ED for sulfate reduction (Eqs. 21-24). These substrates include reducing agents (like H2, ethanol, lactate etc.) and various SCCs (like acetate, propionate, and butyrate), all of which are critical substrate for CE. (21) 2 C 2 H 5 OH + SO 4 2 ‐ + 2 H + → 2 CH 3 COOH + H 2 S + 2 H 2 OΔ G r o = − 132.97 kJ / mol 2CH 3 CH(OH)COOH + SO 4 2‐ + 2H + → 2CH 3 COOH + H 2 S + 2H 2 O + 2CO 2 Δ G r o = − 251.17 kJ / mol (22) (23) 4 H 2 + SO 4 2 ‐ + 2 H + → H 2 S + 4 H 2 O Δ G r o = − 232.17 kJ / mol (24) CH 3 COOH + SO 4 2 ‐ + 2 H + → H 2 S + 2 H 2 O + 2 CO 2 Δ G r o = − 177.17 kJ / mol Studies have found that when COD/SO4 −2 ratio is lower than 0.67, organic matters can be completely oxidized by sulfate-reducing bacteria (Omil et al., 1998). In addition, sulfate-reducing process is thermodynamically more favorable than CE process and methanogenesis process (Cavalcante et al., 2017). Thus, when sulfur-rich material is used as substrate, sulfate-reducing process can become predominant. Therefore, measurements are needed to suppress sulfate-reducing bacteria. Na2MoO4 has been widely used to inhibit sulfate-reducing process (Lian et al., 2006; Cheng et al., 2019). Besides, it was found that fluoroacetate, molybdate and chloroform can also inhibit sulfate-reducing process other than methanogenesis process (Chidthaisong and Conrad, 2000; Scholten et al., 2000). 7.2.8 Denitrification process Similar to sulfate-reducing process, biological denitrification process also consumes the substrate to provide electrons for nitrate reduction to N2 (Wang and Chu, 2016; Wu et al., 2018; Xia et al., 2020). Denitrification process is thermodynamically more favorable than sulfate-reducing process (Eqs. 25-28), so the inhibition of denitrification process is also necessary to ensure the efficient MCCs production when nitrite-rich material is used as substrate. Nitrite and free nitrous acid have been widely accepted to be inhibitory to nitrate reduction (Zhou et al., 2008). Besides, BES was also observed to be partly inhibitory to nitrate reduction (Chidthaisong and Conrad, 2000). (25) 5 CH 3 OH + 6 NO 3 ‐ + 6 H + → 3 N 2 + 13 H 2 O + 5 CO 2 Δ G r o = − 3510.80 kJ / mol (26) 5 C 2 H 5 OH + 12 NO 3 ‐ + 12 H + → 6 N 2 + 21 H 2 O + 10 CO 2 Δ G r o = − 6680.60 kJ / mol (27) CH 3 COOH + 8 NO 3 ‐ + 13 H + → 4 N 2 + 14 H 2 O + 10 CO 2 Δ G r o = − 6005.00 kJ / mol (28) 5 C 6 H 12 O 6 + 24 NO 3 ‐ + 24 H + → 12 N 2 + 42 H 2 O + 30 CO 2 Δ G r o = 14524.20 kJ / mol The effect of sulfate-reducing process and denitrification process on MCCs production by CE has not been reported at present, which was worth studying in future research."
27,Eliminating the inhibition,"7.3 Eliminating the inhibition 7.3.1 Substrate inhibition Toxic components in substrate may inhibit the MCCs production. Before the CE, complex organics are firstly hydrolyzed and acidified to form SCCs to serve as EA or ED. However, studies have found that wide range of components can inhibit the anaerobic digestion process, thus restricting the subsequent MCCs production by CE process. The inhibiting components include organic toxicants like chlorophenols, halogenated aliphatics and long chain fatty acids; inorganic toxicants like ammonia, sulfide and heavy metals (Wang and Chen, 2006), and nanomaterials like nanoparticles and nanotubes (Chen et al., 2014). Measurements to alleviate the inhibition of toxic components in substrate include microbial acclimation, microbial immobilization, substrate dilution and co-fermentation (Rajagopal et al., 2013; Yang and Wang, 2017a; Zhang et al., 2019; Yin et al., 2021). For example, ammonia inhibition alleviation was achieved by microbial immobilization, and caproate (C6) production was enhanced from 3.4-4.0 mM in suspended group to 12.7-64.7 mM in immobilized group in the presence of 2-5 g/L ammonia (Zhang et al., 2019). 7.3.2 Products inhibition With the accumulation of MCCs, feedback inhibition may happen when MCCs reaches the threshold of toxicity. It was found that undissociated MCCs are more toxic than dissociated MCCs (Ge et al., 2015). Strategies to mitigate or eliminate the products inhibition include broth dilution, pH adjusting and MCCs extraction (Angenent et al., 2016). Broth dilution is the easiest way to decrease the products concentration, but it would sacrifice the MCCs production rate and increase the subsequent extraction cost, which is not recommended (Wu et al., 2019c). Controlling the reactor at neutral or weakly acidic pH could preserve a favorable environment for CE and prevent the formation of large amount of undissociated acids. Adding buffer solutions, alkaline trace metals and inorganic carbon source have been widely used for pH control. For example, Straeuber et al. (2018) remained the pH of batch fermentation at around pH 5 by adding alkaline trace metal additives like Fe(OH)3 or Mn(OH)2, caproate (C6) yield enhanced from 0.1 g/kg VS to 5.3-8.1 g/kg VS. San-Valero et al. (2020) achieved caproate (C6) production of 13.3 g/L-19.4 by controlling the reactor pH at pH 6.4-7.5. In addition, with the addition of bicarbonate for pH control, caproate (C6) production further increased up to 21.4 g/L. In-situ MCCs extraction is also a good approach to prevent product inhibition, and this technology will be introduced in detail in section 8."
28,Substrate pretreatment,"7.4 Substrate pretreatment Grootscholten et al. (2014) found that an sufficient hydrolysis of municipal solid waste can significantly promote the subsequent CE process. Studies found that biomass hydrolysis could be promoted by substrate pretreatment (Wang and Yin, 2018b). For example, Ma et al. (2020) conducted MCCs production from food waste, different pretreatments including ultrasonication, hydrothermal and combined alkaline-thermal pretreatments were used to enhance the biodegradability of substrate. Results showed that ultrasonication and hydrothermal pretreatments promoted SCCs and lactic acid formation, thus enhanced the subsequent MCCs production. Ultrasonication and hydrothermal pretreatments enhanced MCCs yields by 2.13 times and 2.15 times comparing with the control group. When sewage sludge is used as substrate, pretreatment can not only promote the hydrolysis process, but also inhibit the competing microbes (like methanogens) in the substrate. For example, Wu et al. (2021) pretreated sludge with 0.67 mg/L free nitrous acid to promote the sludge acidification; Chen et al. (2020) added alkyl polyglucoses in sewage sludge to promote sludge disruption and inhibit methanogens; Wu et al. (2020c) conducted alkaline fermentation at pH 10 to promote SCCs accumulation and inhibit the methanogens. Although the substrate pretreatment has been widely studied in biochemical production like biohydrogen, biomethane, bioethanol and SCCs production (Yang and Wang, 2019b), the effect of pretreatment on MCCs production has been reported rarely at present. With the extension of substrate sources for MCCs production, more studied concerning the substrate pretreatment are needed to figure out the fundamentals of stimulated MCCs production by different pretreatment methods, and the optimal pretreatment conditions."
29,Process optimization,"7.5 Process optimization As discussed in section 6, biological MCCs production is affected by various factors. Thus, process optimization is usually necessary to achieve a satisfying MCCs production, and the optimal conditions can be obtained through either one-factor optimization or multi-factor optimization. In the one-factor optimization process, the influcing factors are optimized by changing one factor at a time while keeping others constant. One-factor optimization is simple to carry out, which is usually used to determine the key influencing factors at the primary stage. For example, Wu et al. (2020a) conducted long-term continuous MCCs production from liquor-making wastewater, and optimized five parameters through one-factor optimization, including temperature, pH, HRT, up-flow velocity, and organic loading rate (OLR). The optimal conditions were determined to be 40 °C, pH 5.4, HRT of 5 h. The highest MCCs production rate of 31 g COD/L/d was obtained at optimized condition, which was around two times of the production rate obtained at the starting period. Wu et al. (2021) examined the optimal ED/EA ratio for MCCs production using one-factor optimization, the optimized ratios for ethanol/acetate, lactate/acetate, and ethanol/lactate/acetate were determined to be 3/1, 2/1, and 2/1/1, respectively, with the optimal substrate concentration of 400 mM carbon. Highest MCCs yield of 646.22 mg COD/g COD was obtained from the optimized co-ED fermentation group. Although one-factor optimization is the most widely used and simplest method to determine the primary influencing factors, the optimization of factors one by one is undoubtedly time-consuming, especially when the influencing factors are multiple, high workload will be required. In comparison, multi-factor optimization methods could optimize multiple factors simultaneously, significantly reduce the workload. Widely used multi-factor optimization methods include Orthogonal matrix design (OMD) and response surface methodology (RSM). In OMD, some representative points are selected according to the orthogenality, and experiments are carried out according to the horizontal combinations chosen by orthogonal tests, largely reduce the number of tests. RSM is a collection of statistical and mathematical techniques, through which points of the feasible region are decided, and experiment is made to obtain the data for most precise prediction (Sarabia and Ortiz, 2009). RSM can also examine the interactive effect between different factors, making RSM a highly preferred method for process optimization when the studied factors are interacted on each other. Box-Behnken design (BBD) and Central composite design (CCD) are the most widely used RSM. Hussain et al. (2019) utilized OMD to optimize carbon sources and fermentation condition for MCCs production by Mucor circinelloides. The highest MCCs content of 4.71 g/L was obtained with coconut oil mixed medium as the carbon source, 300 rpm agitation speed, 26 °C and pH 6.0. Wang et al. (2018) adopted BBD to optimize the medium composition for MCCs production by Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6, maximum caproate (C6) yield of 16.27 g/L was achieved from a medium containing 13.30 g/L sucrose, 22.35 g/L lactate and 16.48 g/L butyrate. Jeon et al. (2013) also performed medium optimization using BBD, the optimized medium contained 0.85 g/L sodium acetate, 6.47 g/L sodium butyrate, 10.13 g/L tryptone, 15.5 g/L yeast extract and 0.04 g/L FeSO4·7H2O. The predicted maximum caproate (C6) concentration was determined to be 6.98 g/L. Statistical analysis showed the interactive effect among all five factors were significant (P<0.05), while the interactive effect between sodium butyrate and FeSO4·7H2O were highly significant (P<0.01). Wang et al. (2018) also performed BBD to maximize caproate (C6) production. The optimized medium contained 13.30 g/L sucrose, 22.35 g/L lactate, and 16.48 g/L butyrate, which supported a high caproate (C6) production of 16.73 g/L and 6.50 g/L/d. Kim et al. (2019) optimized the culture medium using CCD to maximize the production of odd-Chain carboxylic acids. The optimal medium contained 2.42 g/L sodium acetate and 18.91 g/L sodium propionate, from which 9.48 g/L valerate (C7) and 2.48 g/L heptanoate(C7) were obtained. One-factor and multi-factor optimization methods are also adopted together for process optimization (Wang and Wan, 2008, 2009a, 2009b). For example, Fernando-Foncillas and Varrone (2021b) performed MCCs production from sewage sludge and food waste, BBD was adopted to optimize the medium characteristics in batch mode. The highest predicted response of 0.155 g/L caproate (C6) was obtained with a sludge/food waste ratio of 6.61, substrate/inoculum ration of 6.73 and initial pH 6.83. The optimized medium was subsequently used in a continuous fermentation, and through the one-factor optimization of operational factors in continuous mode, a maximum caproate (C6) production of 4.9 g/L and 2.46 g/L/d was achieved with OLR of 54.0 g COD/L/d and HRT of 2 d. It can be seen that the optimal conditions varied in different studies due to the varied substrate compositions and inoculum sources. Some common conclusions could be obtained from the optimization processes like the optimal temperature and pH value ranged in 26-40 °C and pH 6.0-pH 6.8, optimal ED/EA in ethanol-guided fermentation system is around 3, and fermentation systems with co-ED and co-EA are more favorable for CE than the systems with sole ED or EA. As the reported MCCs production optimization is far from enough, more studies are needed to supply more information and guidance for conditions selection. As discussed in the above section, MCCs production could be enhanced through five primary strategies: strengthening the microbial communities, preventing the competing processes, eliminating the inhibitions, pretreating the substrate and process optimization. To carry out the strategies, different methods could be adopted: (1) to strengthen the microbial communities and their functions, the microbial immobilization, bioaugmentation, genetic modification, and synthetic co-culture of different microbes could be adopted; (2) for the prevention of the competing processes, controlling H2/CO2 partial pressure could be adopted to avoid the unnecessary ethanol oxidation, lactate waste can be decreased through controlling lactate concentration in lactate-guided CE systems, microbes unfavorable for MCCs production could be inhibited through controlling HRT, adding inhibitors, synthetic co-culture and the pretreatment of inoculum and substrate; (3) eliminating the inhibition comprises both the inhibition from substrate and products. Co-fermentation of different substrate could dilute the inhibition present in certain substrate, products in-situ extraction and pH control can effectively eliminate the products inhibition, while microbial immobilization and broth dilution can be adopted to eliminate both substrate and product inhibition; (4) substrate pretreatment can not only promote the substrate hydrolysis but inhibiting the unfavorable microbes, which can be achieved through physical, chemical and biological treatment methods; (5) process optimization can be accomplished through one-factor and multi-factor optimization methods, and the factors to be optimized mainly include pH, temperature, additives, ED/EA ratio and H2/CO/CO2 partial pressure. The various strategies and the corresponding methods for enhancing MCCs production are summarized in Fig. 3 ."
30,Separation and extraction of MCCs,"The downstream separation and extraction of MCCs can account for 40-50% of the total operation cost, making the MCCs recovery a vital step for the whole process (Menon and Lyng, 2021). Lots of efforts have been made to explore the high efficient, high purity and economic efficient technologies for MCCs recovery. A variety of physical/chemical techniques are capable of recovering volatile fatty acids from the aqueous phase, like distillation, precipitation, adsorption, liquid–liquid extraction, reactive extraction, ion exchange, and membrane processes (Wang et al., 1994; Aghapour Aktij et al., 2020). In addition, to promote the MCCs production, in-situ MCCs extraction from the fermentation broth were widely studied. Reported in-situ MCCs extraction methods include liquid-liquid extraction, membrane-based extraction and anion-exchange resin adsorption. Table 8 summarizes the technologies used for MCCs extraction."
31,Liquid-liquid extraction,"8.1 Liquid-liquid extraction Liquid-liquid extraction (pertraction) is the oldest but most studied method for volatile fatty acids extraction. The solvents used in liquid-liquid extraction include the physical solvents, reactive solvents and ionic liquids (Bokhary et al., 2021). Reactive solvents are produced by the addition of extractants in physical solvents (diluents), through the reversible reaction between MCCs and extractant in diluent, higher extraction yields could be achieved than typical physical extraction using diluents alone. Kaur et al. (2020) reported a 75–85 % increase in extraction yields by reactive extraction over physical extraction. Widely used diluents include benzene, toluene, decanol, octanol, oleyl alcohol, methyloctanoate and hexanol. Benzene has been widely accepted as the diluent with highest extraction capacity (Wasewar and Shende, 2010; Mukherjee and Munshi, 2020), and the comparison of the extraction capacity of different diluents was in the order of benzene> toluene>decanol>octanol>hexanol (Mukherjee and Munshi, 2020). However, it is well-known that the high efficient diluents like benzene and toluene are toxic solvents, which are not environmentally friendly, and may inhibit the microbial activity during the in-situ extraction. Kaur et al. (2020) reported 80% decrease in total volatile fatty acids production in diluent methyloctanoate. By contrast, little inhibiting effect to microbial growth was observed, indicating oley alcohol was a good choice for the in-situ MCCs extraction (Choi et al., 2013). In addition, non-toxic diluents like sunflower and soybean oils were also explored as substitutes, both of which showed comparable or higher extraction capacity comparing with the toxic diluents (Mukherjee and Munshi, 2020). Besides the diluents selection, various extractants were also examined for the efficient MCCs extraction. The extractants include trioctylamine, tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP), Aliquat 336, alamine 336, N-methyldioctylamine and tri-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO). Aliquat 336 and TOPO were chosen as the best reactive extractants for MCCs extraction (Kaur et al., 2020). Although the utilization of extractants could significantly enhance the extraction efficiency, the inhibiting effect of extractants on microorganisms is nonnegligible. Yabannavar and Wang (1991) reported the complete inhibition of microbial growth in the presence of 30 % trioctylamine. Kaur et al. (2020) reported 71% and 51% decrease in total volatile fatty acids production in methyloctanoate added with Aliquat 336 and TOPO. To avoid the inhibiting effect of both diluents and extractants, extraction systems without direct contact with the fermentation broth is recommended (Ge et al., 2015). The continuous in-situ extraction of MCCs from the bioreactor broth resulted in a low MCCs concentration in the fermentation broth, which successfully eliminated the products inhibition and significantly enhanced MCCs production rates (Spirito et al., 2018). In addition, a selective pressure toward continued longer MCCs production was created, resulting in higher production during the fermentation process (Kucek et al., 2016c). Besides the reactive extraction, ionic liquid extraction emerges as an efficient liquid-liquid extraction technology, but still in early stages of development. Studies found that the selectivity and distribution coefficients of target chemical varied a lot with the different chemical and physical properties of ionic liquids (Bokhary et al., 2021). Chwialkowska et al. (2019) investigated liquid-liquid extraction of caproate (C6) with ionic liquids, a pretty high extraction efficiency of over 98% was achieved with piperazinium IL [C1C1C10Ppz][NTF2], but the selectivity was only 0.39; by contrast, piperazinium [C1C1C6Ppz][NTF2] showed less effective caproate (C6) recovery of 85.9%, but obtained a higher selectivity of 0.53."
32,Membrane-based extraction,"8.2 Membrane-based extraction Membrane-based separation processes can be categorized into two categories: pressure-driven processes and non-pressure-driven processes (Aghapour Aktij et al., 2020; Wang and Liu, 2021). The pressure-driven processes were feasible of enriching all volatile fatty acids present in the fermentation broth but with low selectivity. For example, Jaenisch et al. (2019) adopted nanofiltration and reverse osmosis for volatile fatty acids recovery, all fatty acids were enriched in the retentate but the separation of acetic acids from other acids was pretty low (0.25%). As SCCs are intended to be reserved in the fermentation broth for the CE process, volatile fatty acids extraction with low selectivity is not preferable for the in-situ MCCs extraction. By contrast, membrane electrolysis shows to be favorable for in-situ MCCs extraction. Membrane electrolysis cell is made up of anode and cathode compartments connected by a power supply. By applying a constant current, anions are transferred from the cathode to the anode through the anion membrane. When the cathode is filled with fermentation broth, dissociated carboxylates are transferred to the anode, and become undissociated acids with the H+ formed at the anode. In this way, the undissociated MCCs that are of low solubility can be easily extracted. By the integration of membrane electrolysis and pertraction, Xu et al. (2015) obtained >90% purity oil with MCCs from the fermentation broth. Furthermore, membrane electrolysis was applied in the in-situ MCCs extraction from the fermentation system. Andersen et al. (2015) extracted around 28 % of MCCs generated per day, while Xu et al. (2021) obtained a continuous oil product with >90% purity of MCCs using a five-compartment electrolysis unit and phase separator. In addition to the high efficient in-situ MCCs extraction, H2 produced at the cathode in membrane electrolysis could supply surplus biological reducing equivalents, and OH- formed in cathode chamber could serve for the in-situ pH regulation, both of which could contribute to the MCCs production in the fermentation process. Andersen et al. (2015) found that with the in-situ extraction of MCCs by membrane electrolysis, MCCs composition was enhanced from around 36% to 70%."
33,Ion exchange extraction,"8.3 Ion exchange extraction Anion-exchange resin could achieve a high extraction efficiency through the ionic bond formed between the resin and the dissociated compound (Wang et al., 2000b), which has been used for SCCs extraction, but a few study in MCCs extraction (Fernando-Foncillas et al., 2021). Roddick and Britz (1997) performed caproate (C6) production by Megasphaera elsdenii, Amberlite IRA 400 was used for the in-situ caproate (C6) extraction. Results showed that the striping of products onto the anion exchange resin significantly improved caproate (C6) production up to 19 g/L. Fernando-Foncillas et al. (2021a) reported the application of Dowex Marathon MSA resin in recovering MCCs from fermentation broth. Caproate (C6) and heptanoate (C7) were better adsorbed than SCCs, and concentrated up to 14.6 and 20.7 times in desorbed solution compared to the feed solution. It was found that strongly basic anion-exchange resin had better potential in enhancing caproate (C6) production (Yu et al., 2019). The selected optimal resin D201 increased average caproate (C6) production rate and cumulative caproate (C6) production by 2.76 and 1.34 times, highest caproate (C6) concentration was increased up to 17.3 g/L."
34,Conclusions and perspectives,"This review extensively analyzed and summarized the biological MCCs production through CE. This technology provides a mild and environmentally friendly way for MCCs production, and facilitates the MCCs-based industries, like the synthesis of drop-in fuel. However, there are some major challenges ahead before biological MCCs production can move to the industrial level. For example, the correlations among different microbes are still unclear, economic and environmental efficiency of the fermentation system still need to be verified, there still lacks a functional model to guide the process operation. To achieve an efficient, stable MCCs production in large-scale application, more efforts are needed in the following aspects:"
35,Metabolic pathway: figuring out the crucial factors determining the CE pathways,"9.1 Metabolic pathway: figuring out the crucial factors determining the CE pathways As mentioned in section 2, two pathways have been found to be responsible for CE process. RBO pathway has been extensively studied and considered to be more efficient than FAB pathway (Chan and Vogel, 2010; Dellomonaco et al., 2011), while FAB pathway has been found to be more active in mixed culture fermentation systems. Thus, more studies are needed to explore the correlations between these two CE pathways, and figure out the critical factors that determine the pivotal pathway for CE in the fermentation system"
36,Microorganism: exploring for the mechanism of efficient microbiome shaping in mixed-culture systems and seeking for more efficient CE strains,"9.2 Microorganism: exploring for the mechanism of efficient microbiome shaping in mixed-culture systems and seeking for more efficient CE strains The mixed-culture fermentation would be more applicable for complicated substrate system. However, there still lacks information concerning the functional microbiome shaping, and the correlations among different microorganisms are still unclear. To achieve an efficient microbiome shaping, a deeper understanding of the relationships among bioreactor performance, feedstock composition, operating conditions, and microbial community succession is needed. The adoption of statistical methods and multi-omic approaches would be helpful. However, the study of pure cultures could provide precious information concerning the strategies of promoting CE process. Although quite a few strains have been isolated and identified to be capable of CE (as shown in section 5), more isolations are still needed to obtain efficient CE-strains. The exploration of new strains not only provides microbial species for bioaugmentation, but supplies valuable gene sources for genetic modification studies."
37,Substrate: expanding substrate sources and exploring for the proper pretreatment methods to promote the substrate utilization,"9.3 Substrate: expanding substrate sources and exploring for the proper pretreatment methods to promote the substrate utilization As demonstrated in section 4, a wide range of substrate sources have been explored for MCCs production. As the large-scale MCCs production requires the substrate supply to be cheap, stable and widely available, pure chemicals like SCCs and saccharides would be uneconomical, while the widely present biomass, organic wastes and syngas can be good choices. Except for the reported feedstock, substrate sources could be further expanded refer to the substrate used in other anaerobic technologies, like bioethanol production, SCCs production and biohydrogen production. When using complex organics as substrate, pretreatment would be necessary to promote the hydrolysis process and stimulate the organic solubilization, thus overcoming the rate-limiting step. When microorganism-rich substrate (like sewage sludge, residual of other fermentation process etc.) is used, pretreatment is also necessary to inhibit the competing microorganisms (like methanogens) in the substrate. Although various pretreatment methods have been widely used in other anaerobic technologies, their application in MCCs is still in early stage. Lots of efforts are needed to explore the proper pretreatment technologies according to specific substrate sources."
38,Inhibition alleviation: figuring out the potential inhibiting factors and search for possible solutions,"9.4 Inhibition alleviation: figuring out the potential inhibiting factors and search for possible solutions Biological process can be inhibited by many factors, like the toxicants in substrate and the accumulated products (Chen et al., 2021b). In biological MCCs production, products inhibition has attracted wide attention and various products extraction technologies have been raised (as mentioned in section 8). However, very few studies have focused on the inhibiting factors present in substrate. With the application of complex organics as substrate, and the adoption of various pretreatment, more inhibiting factors may be introduced into the fermentation system. Figuring out and eliminating the potential inhibitive factors would be necessary to ensure an efficient and stable system operation."
39,Product selectivity: exploring for strategies to enhance the target product formation,"9.5 Product selectivity: exploring for strategies to enhance the target product formation The high product selectivity could significantly reduce the cost in subsequent product separation and purification. It was found that the selectivity toward caproate (C6) production could be enhanced by activated carbon addition (Ghysels et al., 2021), and caprylate (C8) production could be promoted by increasing the ethanol to acetate ratio in substrate (Kucek et al., 2016b), but the information is far from enough. Thus, more efforts are recommended to explore for strategies to enhance the target product formation, especially for the production of longer-chain MCCs (C7-C12)."
