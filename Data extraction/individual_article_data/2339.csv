0,Introduction,"The generation of hydrogen (H2) from water using solar energy through semiconductors materials has great potential in solving environmental pollution and energy crisis because of the high chemical energy and environmental friendliness of hydrogen [1–3]. Among these semiconductor materials, TiO2 plays an outstanding role in various photocatalysis or photoelectroncatalytic processes to water purification and water splitting due to its low price, high efficiency, environmental friendliness, and stable performance [4–6]. However, the rapid recombination of photogenerated charges and the low light utilization capacity has limited its further application [7–10]. Therefore, the problem is solved by massive endeavors (for instance surface modification [11–13], co-catalyst loading [14,15] and heterojunction construction [16,17]). In these methods, the co-catalysts not only serves as an electron acceptor to improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, but also serves as reactive sites and reduce the energy barrier for the generation of H2 [18–20]. Among co-catalysts, noble metals (such as Ag, Pt, Pd, Au) have shown good performance for photocatalytic H2 evolution, but their expensive price and lack of resources hinder its further application [21,22]. Therefore, it is very necessary to explore a suitable co-catalyst for improving photocatalytic hydrogen production. 2D MXene materials are a very potential candidate in the co-catalysts because of their hydrophilicity, photostability, large specific surface area and high conductivity [23–25]. Especially, due to the successful synthesis of MXene by Yury Gogotsi group in 2011, MXene materials have been extensively studied for many technical applications, such as energy storage [26], electromagnetic interference fielding [27] and biomedical applications [28]. MXenes are usually synthesized from their precursor material Mn+1AXn phase through selective etching of the ""A"" layer, where M is a transition metal (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Nb, Mo, Hf), A is a third or fourth main group element (Al or Si), and X is nitrogen or carbon [29]. Therefore, MXenes can be expressed as Mn+1XnTx, where M and X are the same as those of the MAX phase, Tx indicate surface termination groups (–OH, -F, =O) generated during the etching process [30]. For instance, 2D Ti3C2 material with accordion-like structure is made by etching the Al layer in Ti3AlC2 with HF solution at a certain time and temperature [31]. Due to its high conductivity and unique layer morphology, Ti3C2 MXene is a promising candidate for co-catalyst, which can replace precious metals for photocatalytic hydrogen production [32]. There are some reports on Ti3C2-TiO2 composite materials. Bao et al. prepared Ti3C2-TiO2 composite by a calcining process of Ti3C2 at high temperature with an increased photocatalytic activity in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) into benzaldehyde (BAD) [33]. Xu et al. synthesized Ti3C2-TiO2 composite by a combination of hydrothermal methods [34]. The Ti3C2-TiO2 composite facilitated the effective separation and migration of photogenerated carriers and enhanced visible light absorption. At present, most of the research is to obtain Ti3C2-TiO2 composite material by hydrothermal method. However, this method cannot obtain products with good morphology and crystalline control, which also limits its further application. Therefore, it is very important to develop a new method for preparing TiO2-Ti3C2 materials. In this article, we reported a simple two-phase mixing method to synthesize Ti3C2-TiO2, and tested its H2 production performance. Compared with pure TiO2, the synthesized Ti3C2-TiO2 composite has a significant improvement in H2 production performance. This may be attributed to the better recombination effect of the two-phase mixing method, which can obtain products with better morphology and crystal state, and Ti3C2 as a co-catalyst effectively reduces the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes, and improves the catalytic efficiency. Due to the low cost, non-toxicity and abundant reserves of TiO2 and Ti3C2, this stable composite material is expected to serve as a photocatalyst for large-scale applications."

Deionized (DI) water is produced in the water purification system. All the chemicals were used as initial status without further treatment."
3,Synthesis of layered Ti3C2 Mxene and TiO2,"2.2 Synthesis of layered Ti3C2 Mxene and TiO2 Two dimensional Ti3C2 nanosheets were prepared by a two-step approach including acid etching and subsequent exfoliation under sonication. Typically, 2 g of LiF and 1 g of Ti3AlC2 are placed in a clean PTFE autoclave of 50 mL. After 40 mL of 9 M HCl were added to the PTFE autoclave, the suspension was under vigorous stirring at 40 °C for 24 hours. The etched Ti3C2 product was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 minutes, and then washed by 1 M HCl and DI water until the neutral pH of about 6. Thereafter, the prepared Ti3C2 product was dispersed in 100 mL of deionized water, which was sonicated under the protection of argon gas for 2 hours. After centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 30 minutes, the supernatant with exfoliated Ti3C2 nanosheets is collected for further application. The powder of exfoliated Ti3C2nanosheets was obtained after a frozen-drying procedure for 2 days. The rhombic-shaped TiO2 nanoparticles with main 101 crystal facets were prepared by a solvothermal process. Typically, 0.6 mL of TTIP was added into the mixed solvents of 1.2 mL oleic acid and 4 mL oleylamine. After sonication for 10 minutes, 20 mL of 95% ethanol was added to get a milky white turbid liquid, which was moved into a 50 mL autoclave immediately. The mixture was under solvothermal process at 180 °C for 24 hours. After cooling to room temperature, TiO2 nanoparticles were centrifuged and dispersed in 20 mL of chloroform for further application."
4,Assembling of Ti3C2-TiO2 composite,"2.3 Assembling of Ti3C2-TiO2 composite A simple two-phase assembling process as the same with our earlier work was applied to prepare the Ti3C2-TiO2 composite as show in Scheme 1 and Fig. S1. The certain amount of above obtained Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets (2, 4 or 6 mg) were mixed with 100 mL of 1.2% TEHA aqueous solution in a 250 mL blue cap bottle. Then, TiO2 nanoparticle dispersion in 50 mL of chloroform with the concentration of 1.2 mg•mL-1 was poured into the Ti3C2 Mxene dispersion. The mixture was kept under gentle stirring at room temperature for 24 hours Finally, Ti3C2-TiO2 composites with the Ti3C2 Mxene mass percent of 3.3%, 6.7% and 10% were obtained after a centrifugal precipitation process."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The crystallographic structure of the catalysts was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using Cu-Kα radiation (Bruker D8ADVANCE, Germany). The light absorption spectra were recorded by UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spec-trophotometer (UV-Vis DRS) at wavelength range of 200–800 nm (UV-3600 Plus, Shimadzu). BaSO4 was used as reflectance reference for the UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The morphology of the samples was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV (Hitachi HT7700) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV (Hitachi SU8220, Japan). The elements contents of samples were detected by energy dispersion spectro-metry (EDS). The thickness of the samples was measured by atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker, and Dimension Fast Scan). Raman spectroscopy measurement was carried out using a Raman spectroscope (LabRam HR800). The chemical states of composites were tested using X-ray photoelectron spectrometry measurements (XPS, Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250XI, England). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were examined by a fluorescence spectrometer (Fluorolog-3, Horiba Instruments Incorporated, USA) with the excitation wavelength of 280 nm. Photoelectrochemical measurements were exploited on electrochemical station (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm) with a three-electrode system consisting of working electrode, Pt counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode, where electrolyte was 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution The CEL-SPH2N-S9 automatic photolysis water system was used to evaluate the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. 50 mg of photocatalysts and 10 mL of triethanolamine (TEAO) were added to 90 mL of distilled water, and 5 mg of H2PtCl4 in 1 mL of DI water was injected as a co-catalyst. The mixed solution was then transferred to a 400 mL quartz reactor in the hydrogen production system. After the air in the system is removed by a vacuum pump under continuous stirring, the photocatalysts were irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp to generate H2. The amount of generated hydrogen was monitored by an online gas chromatograph (GC-7920, Beijing China) equipped with a TCD detector."
7,Results and discussions,
8,Characterization of Mxene-TiO2 composites,"3.1 Characterization of Mxene-TiO2 composites The two-phase assembling method was utilized to prepare high-quality grapheme-based composite with good interface contact, uniform distribution and good morphology control of inorganic nanomaterials, which created a good photocatalytic activity in the degradation of organic dye, hydrogen evolution and antibacterial [35–37]. Similar to graphene oxide, the exfoliated Ti3C2 nanosheets contains some polar groups of -OH, -O, and -F groups [38,39], which favors the interface assembling of TiO2 nanoparticles on its surface to fabricate Ti3C2-TiO2 composites. Before the two-phase assembling process, the exfoliated Ti3C2 sheets and rhombic TiO2 nanoparticles capped with oleylamine are dispersed in water and chloroform separately. Then, two insoluble solutions were mixed together under intense stirring for 24 hours to make sure a sufficient compounding of Ti3C2 nanosheets and TiO2 nanoparticles. The exfoliated Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets are prepared by selectively etching of Al-containing layers in Ti3AlC2 MAX phase with the mixture of LiF and concentrated HCl and subsequent ultrasonic exfoliation process. As shown in Fig. 1a, the original Ti3AlC2 present a three-dimensional bulk structure. After etching in the mixture of LiF and HCl, a clear layered structure can be observed in Fig. 1b, indicating the effective etching of Al. After an exfoliation process under the protection of N2, the independent Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets with the size of 200 nm can be acquired (Fig. 1c). The thickness of exfoliated Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets is calculated about 1.61 nm according to AFM characterizations (Fig. 1d, e), suggesting the successful etching and exfoliation of Ti3AlC2 into single layer Ti3C2 nanosheets, which is in well consistent with the results from earlier reports [40]. As shown in Fig. 1f, rhombic-shape TiO2 nanoparticles of 15 nm with main {101} facets are obtained with the capping reagent of oleylamine, which can be well-dispersed as a transparent dispersion in chloroform. Finally, the Ti3C2-TiO2 composites are synthesized by a facile two-phase assembling method. As shown in Fig. 1g and h, TiO2 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the surface of Ti3C2 nanosheets with an expected intimate contact. In addition, the morphology and size of rhombic-shape TiO2 don’t have evident changes after the immobilization on the Ti3C2 nanosheets. Moreover, clear lattice spacings of 0.35 nm and 0.23 nm in the HRTEM image for Ti3C2-TiO2 composite are corresponded to the {101} facet of anatase TiO2 and Ti3C2 nanosheets with clear interface, further confirming the successful loading of TiO2 nanoparticles on the surface Ti3C2 nanosheets with well interface contact (Fig. 1g). In order to investigate the element distribution in the Ti3C2-TiO2 composites, elemental mapping was executed by EDS analysis in the SEM. As presented in Fig. 1J, the Ti, C, and O elements are distributed accordantly within the selected area, which further verifies the formation of TiO2-Ti3C2 composites as show in Fig. S2. In addition, we also fabricate spherical TiO2, and Ti3C2-TiO2 (spherical) composites are obtained by the same method as show in Fig. S3. To investigate the phase structure and crystallization of as-prepared samples, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were conducted. As shown in Fig. 2a, after the etching of Ti3AlC2 by HCl+LiF, the main diffraction peak (104) of Ti3AlC2 is disappeared and the (002) peak also shifts to a lower 2θ angle, indicating the successful removal of the Al layers.The characteristic diffraction peaks of (002) crystal plane for primitive Ti3AlC2 and etched Ti3C2 MXene are located at 2θ= 9.5° and 2θ= 6.5°, and the caculated interlayer spaces according to Bragg formular are 9.30 and 20.93 Å. The expanded interleyer distance of Ti3C2 layers is attributed to the synergistic effect of etching and ultrasound, which is consistent with the SEM characterizations. The XRD patterns of Ti3C2-TiO2 composites with different Ti3C2 content are illustrated in Fig. 2b. It can be obtained that Ti3C2-TiO2 composites possess almost the same diffraction peaks as that of TiO2 nanoparticles, which is in accordance with the JCPDS card no. 21–1272 of anatase TiO2 [41]. The results show that the compounding with two-dimensional Ti3C2 does not change the crystal structure of TiO2 in the Ti3C2-TiO2 composites. It is worth noting that the 002 peaks of Ti3C2 nanosheets are disapeared in the Ti3C2-TiO2 composites, which is caused by the prevented stacks of Ti3C2 nanosheets by the loading of TiO2 nanoparticles. This further verified the good immobilization of TiO2 and Ti3C2 nanosheets. Fig. 2c presents the Raman spectra of the samples.In the spectrum of TiO2 (Fig. 2c), several characteristic bands of Eg (148 cm−1), B1 g (400 cm−1), A1 g (517 cm−1) and Eg (643 cm−1) correspond to the typical anatase phase of TiO2. Similar characteristic peaks are also observed in the Ti3C2-TiO2 composites. However, the characteristic bands of Ti3C2Tx are not observed in the Raman spectra of the Ti3C2-TiO2 composites, probably because the low content of Ti3C2Tx. According to Fig. 2c, the Raman peaks of TiO2 at 147.7 cm−1 shifts to 152.5 cm−1 in Ti3C2-TiO2 composites, which is resulted from the interaction between TiO2 and Ti3C2 nanosheets [42]. The FTIR spectra are further applied to investigate the interaction and surface groups of Ti3C2-TiO2 composites. For the FTIR spectrum of TiO2 nanoparticles as presented in Fig. 2d, two sharp absorption bands at 2922.1 and 2850.7 cm−1 are corresponded to the characteristic vibrating peaks of hydrocarbon chain, and the weak absorption at 1465.8 and 1404.1 cm−1 are due to the C-O stretching and the O-H deformation [35]. This result illustrates the presence of oleylamine and oleic acid in TiO2. In order to inhibit the hydrophobic effect of oleic acid and oleylamine, Ti3C2-TiO2 composites were washed with a nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate solution in dimethylformamide. The characteristic peaks of oleic acid and oleylamine are effectively removed in the FTIR spectrum of Ti3C2-TiO2 composites. The thoroughly remove of hydrophobic ligands is indispensable for the good water adsorption and hydrogen evolution properties. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis is conducted to further investigate the chemical composition and states of elements, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3a, the XPS survey spectra of the samples reveals that the main elements are Ti 2p, O 1 s and C 1 s in the Ti3C2-TiO2 composites. As shown in Fig. 3b, the Ti 2p peak of Ti3C2 can be deconvoluted into four pairs of doublet components (Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2). The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p3/2 in pristine Ti3C2 present four peaks at 455.0, 455.8, 457.2 and 459.2 eV, corresponding to Ti-C bond, Ti-X from sub-stoichiometric TiCx (x < 1) or titanium oxycarbides, Ti-O from TixOy and TiO2, respectively [43]. Ti3C2-TiO2 composites possess almost the same Ti 2p XPS peaks as that of primitive TiO2 nanoparticles, probably because the low content of Ti3C2Tx. However, the Ti 2p XPS peaks of Ti3C2-TiO2 composites shift to lower binding energy in comparison to that of pristine TiO2. For instance, the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 XPS peaks Ti3C2-TiO2 composites centered at 458.35 and 464.01 eV, while these peaks in pristine TiO2 centered at 458.64 and 464.36 eV. The shift of binding energy is resulted from the interaction between TiO2 and Ti3C2 nanosheets [44]. According to Fig. 3c, the O 1 s XPS spectra exhibit three peaks centered at 529.6, 531.9 and 533.5 eV, designated to Ti-O-Ti, oxygen vacancy (Vo) and adsorbed O species, respectively. Especially, the Vo content of the Ti3C2-TiO2 composites is significantly higher than that of the pristine TiO2, which is consistent with the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of the Ti3C2-TiO2 composites.The C 1 s XPS spectrum exhibits five obvious peaks at 281.8, 282.5, 284.8, 286.3 eV and 289.1 eV in Fig. 3d, which corresponds to the bonds of Ti-C, C-Ti-O, C-C, C-O and C-F, respectively [45]. The C 1 s XPS spectrum presents the presence of Ti-C bond in Ti3C2-TiO2 composites, further confirming the formation of Ti3C2-TiO2 composites."
9,Photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of Ti3C2-TiO2 composite,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of Ti3C2-TiO2 composite The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of {101} TiO2 and Ti3C2-TiO2 composites are evaluated under irradiation of 300 W simulated solar lights. As illustrated in Fig. 4a-b, the production of H2 increases approximately linearly with the reaction time for all the photocatalysts. The hydrogen evolution rates for TiO2, 3.3%Ti3C2-TiO2, 6.7%Ti3C2-TiO2 and 10%Ti3C2-TiO2 are calculated as 190.47, 199.02, 390.92, and 270.31 μmol·h−1, respectively. Obviously, Ti3C2-TiO2 composites possessed higher photocatalytic H2 generation activity than that of primitive TiO2. When the adding amount of Ti3C2 is less than 6.7%, the photocatalytic H2 generation activity significantly increase with the increased Ti3C2 content. However, when the Ti3C2 content is increased to 10 wt%, the photocatalytic activity began to decrease due to the light shielding effect of excessive Ti3C2 nanosheets. The highest H2 evolution activity of 390.92 μmol·h−1 was acquired by the 6.7%Ti3C2-TiO2 composites, which is 2.1 times of {101} TiO2. Our Ti3C2-TiO2 composites prepared from the two-phase assembling process hold higher photocatalytic activity than that of Ti3C2-TiO2 composites reported by early literatures in Table 1 [46–50], which is caused by the higher photocatalytic activity of TiO2 with high energy {101} facets, and better morphology and size control than in-situ prepared counterparts. For comparison, 6.7%Ti3C2-TiO2 composite with 5 nm nanoparticles without special facets was prepared by the same process. However, the H2 evolution activity of 310.55 μmol·h−1 can be obtained, which is lower than that of 6.7%Ti3C2-TiO2 composite with {101} facets (Fig. S4). As reported earlier by many groups [51], TiO2 with special high energy facets presented higher photocatalytic activity. Our result is in well agreement with that. In order to investigate the photocatalytic stability of Ti3C2-TiO2 composites, 4 cycling photocatalytic experiments were executed. As shown in Fig. 4c, no evident decrease of photocatalytic H2 evolution activity can be observed after 4 cycling experiments, indicating the excellent photocatalytic stability of Ti3C2-TiO2 composites. In addition, as shown from TEM images (Fig. S5) and XRD patterns (Fig. S6) of Ti3C2-TiO2 catalyst after catalytic reaction, TiO2 nanoparticles are still uniformly loaded on the surface of Ti3C2 nanosheets without evident changes in the morphology and facet, indicating that Ti3C2-TiO2 composites have excellent stability during the photocatalytic reaction process. The optical properties of Ti3C2Tx, TiO2, and Ti3C2-TiO2 composites were investigated by UV–vis absorption spectra. As shown in Fig. 5a, Ti3C2Tx nanosheets display a strong absorption in the full region (200–800 nm), which is in good agreement with the results from earlier report [46]. TiO2 exhibits an adsorption onset of 385 nm in the UV region, indicating a wide band-gap of 3.2 eV, which is consistent with that of anatase TiO2. After compounding with Ti3C2 nanosheets, the absorption onsets of TiO2 in the Ti3C2-TiO2 composites present a slightly red-shift relative to the TiO2. With the increase of Ti3C2 mass, the absorption onset are at 405, 410 and 415 nm, respectively, indicating the extension to the visible area. The high absorption of Ti3C2-TiO2 composites in the visible light region is resulted from the light scattering effect of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. The recombination rate of e- and h+ has been further studied by photoluminescence (PL) measurement (Fig. 5b). Generally, the stronger intensity of PL emission means a higher recombination rate of photogenerated carriers [52]. The PL spectra exhibits that the Ti3C2-TiO2 composites has lower characteristic peaks than pure TiO2, suggesting that introduction of Ti3C2 nanosheets effectively promoted the separation of photogenerated carriers and suppressed the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. In addition, 6.7% Ti3C2-TiO2 composites has the lowest intensity, indicating the efficiently promoted separation of photogenerated carriers. In order to further investigate the effect of two-dimensional Ti3C2 on the band gap of TiO2, the following formula is used to calculate the band gap energy of TiO2 and Ti3C2-TiO2 composites:(αhv)n = K(hv - Eg)，where α is the absorption coefficient, his Plank’s constant, ʋ is light frequency, K is a constant, Eg is the band gap energy and n is 2 because TiO2 is a direct semiconductor. As shown in Fig. 6a, the band gap energy of anatase TiO2 is 3.2 eV. The calculated band gaps of TiO2 loading on variable mass of Ti3C2 nanosheets (3.3 wt%, 6.7 wt%, and 10 wt%) are narrowed to 3.14, 3.09 and 2.88 eV, respectively, which is consistent with the red shift of the absorption onset. This suggests that the combination of TiO2 and Ti3C2 nanosheets can slightly reduce the band gap of TiO2, which will favor the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution application. The valence band (VB) XPS spectra test is carried out to measure precisely the VB position of TiO2 with {101} facets. As presented at Fig. 6b, the position of the VB energy level of TiO2 is about + 2.85 eV. According to the estimated VB and band gap energy (Eg) of TiO2, the conduction band (CB) position is found to be − 0.35 eV. In addition, the work function (Φ) of MXene and TiO2 has been estimated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), which is an important parameter related to the electronic property. The excitation source of He I (hν = 21.2 eV) is applied in the UPS measurement. As shown in Fig. 6c-d, the secondary electron cut-off (W) of Ti3C2 and TiO2 are 17.46 and 15.62 eV, respectively. The following formula is used to calculate the work function (Φ) of Ti3C2 and TiO2: Φ = hv – W. Therefore, the work function (Φ) of Ti3C2 and TiO2 are 3.74 and 5.58 eV, respectively. The results show that the work function of Ti3C2 is lower than that of TiO2, and electrons can be transferred from Ti3C2 to TiO2. After the Fermi level reaches equilibrium, a built-in potential is generated between negatively charged TiO2 and positively charged Ti3C2 nanosheets, which is beneficial to receive the photogenerated electrons of TiO2, thereby inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. The transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) are obtained to further investigate the charge separation and transfer dynamics. All samples show a photocurrent response under the illumination of 300 W Xe lamps. As shown in Fig. 7a, the transient photocurrent of Ti3C2-TiO2 composites is much higher than that of original TiO2, which can be attributed to the higher separation efficiency of photo-generated electron-hole pairs in Ti3C2-TiO2 composites. In particular, the 6.7% Ti3C2-TiO2 composites exhibits the highest transient photocurrent with comparison to pristine TiO2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is also an effective a tool to investigate the charge transfer process. As show in Fig. 7b, 6.7% Ti3C2-TiO2 composites also exhibit the smallest arc radius than pristine TiO2, suggesting that 6.7% Ti3C2-TiO2 composites has the smallest charge transfer resistance. This finally results in a high charge separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. Based on above experimental results and energy structure analysis, a possible photocatalytic mechanism of Ti3C2-TiO2 photocatalysts is proposed as shown in Fig. 8. As calculated from UPS results, the work functions for rhombic TiO2 and Ti3C2 are 5.58 and 3.74 eV, and the corresponding Fermi energy (Ef) levels for rhombic TiO2 and Ti3C2 are −5.58 and −3.74 eV, respectively. After the contact of TiO2 and Ti3C2, the electrons in Ti3C2 sheets will shift to TiO2 until the Ef levels become equal to reach equilibrium, resulting to downward bending energy bands for TiO2 nanoparticles and an internal electric field at the interface of TiO2 and Ti3C2 Mxene [53]. Upon solar light irradiation, the electrons are excited from the valence band (VB) of TiO2 to the conduction band (CB), inducing the formation of holes in the VB. Due to higher energy level of irradiated electrons in the CB than the balanced Fermi level of Ti3C2, the electrons in the CB of TiO2 will be transported into Ti3C2 because of the internal electric field and ohmic contact at the interface of TiO2 and Ti3C2. Finally, the photogenerated electrons will accumulate on Pt nanoparticles and the electrons reduced the protons (H + ) to produce H2. The holes left on the VB of TiO2 is consumed by the hole scavenger of TEOA. Through the simple two-phase assembling method, TiO2 can be loaded uniformly on the surface of Ti3C2 nanosheets to form a close contact interface, which effectively suppressed the aggregation of TiO2 and Ti3C2 nanosheets. The introduction of Ti3C2 nanosheets facilitates the interface charge transfer and separation, prevents the charge recombination, and leads to a significantly increased photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, the novel Ti3C2-TiO2 composites with high energy {101} facets are successfully fabricated by a simple two-phase assembling method. Rhombic anatase TiO2 nanoparticles of 15 nm are uniformly attached on the surface of Ti3C2 nanosheets about 200–400 nm. The combination of Ti3C2 and TiO2 effectively suppressed the aggregation of TiO2 and Ti3C2 nanosheets without evidently changing the size and crystal structures of TiO2. Through this two-phase assembling method, high-quality Ti3C2-TiO2 composites with better control of size and crystal structure can be acquired. Ti3C2-TiO2 composites display remarkably enhanced photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution with comparison to pristine TiO2. In addition, the optimal loading amount of the Ti3C2 is of 6.7 wt% with the hydrogen generation rate of 390.92 μmol·h−1, which is 2.1 times of original TiO2. Our Ti3C2-TiO2 composites with {101} facets and good interface contact possess higher photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity than the similar composites from earlier reports. The high H2 production activity can be attributed to the high energy {101} facets of TiO2, the good interface contact of TiO2 and Ti3C2, the broadened light absorption range of TiO2, the improved charge separation and transfer, and the significantly inhibited carrier recombination. This work provides a new strategy for the preparation of Mxene-TiO2 photocatalysts with excellent H2 production activity."
