0,Introduction,"Hydrogen gas (H2), a prospective fuel candidate, has been attracted remarkable attention of the energy-related science and engineering (Sivagurunathan et al., 2017). How the hydrogen is produced determines whether it is clean and renewable or not (Hu et al., 2018). Recently, two main methods such as thermochemical and biological are used to produce hydrogen gas (Chozhavendhan et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2016b). Compared to thermochemical method, biological method presents more potential to substitute the fossil fuels due to its mid operating conditions (Hu et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2016b). Biological hydrogen production methods can be mainly categorized into direct biophotolysis, indirect biophotolysis, dark fermentation, and photo-fermentation (Kothari et al., 2012). Photo-fermentation has been considered as a promising method standing out from the crowd because of its ability to achieve higher hydrogen yield as well as higher substrate conversion efficiency (Jiang et al., 2021a). Arundo donax L.(giant reed), a perennial rhizomatous grass, mainly consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin (Ge et al., 2016). On account of its high biomass yield and low cultivation inputs, giant reed has been used as carbohydrate sources for bioenergy production, for example, biogas and biohydrogen production (Jiang et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2016a). Nevertheless, the complex structure of cell wall components and considerable content of lignin make giant reed highly recalcitrant to enzymatic digestion, which astricts the energy yield output (Ge et al., 2016). Therefore, efficient pretreatment becomes a key step to deteriorate polysaccharides to reducing sugar for higher yield of bioenergy achievement (Zhang et al., 2017). Moreover, suitable pretreatment strategy, such as pretreatment liquor reuse, would help to achieve cost-effective photo-fermentative hydrogen production via declining the reagent input (Jiang et al., 2017). ILs are a breakthrough in green technology, which are composed of organic or inorganic and anions organic cations, existing in liquid state (Elgharbawy et al., 2016; Rocha et al., 2017). In addition to the capable of dissolving lignin and carbohydrates, ILs also provide several attractive features such as thermal stability, low vapor pressure, polarity, solvent miscibility and hydrophobicity (Elgharbawy et al., 2016; Rocha et al., 2017). Furthermore, ILs pretreatment can perform in mild condition and achieve reagent recovery with low energy consumption (Granström et al., 2008; Mirjafari et al., 2013). These properties make ILs a possible substitute of common (and toxic) reagent in biomass pretreatment for bioenergy production (Outeiriño et al., 2021; Rocha et al., 2017). A series of pretreatments have been studied for giant reed, such as diluted acid (Shatalov and Pereira, 2012), alkali (Jiang et al., 2020), fungi (Liu et al., 2016b), liquid hot water (Jiang et al., 2016a), however, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, most of these studies were concentrated on biogas production, reports on ILs pretreatment on giant reed especially in photo-fermentative hydrogen production are still limited. Moreover, the comparison study of different ILs pretreatment of Arundo donax L. on structure changes, enzymatic hydrolysis, and hydrogen production via photo-fermentation are still unclear. The objective of this study was to estimate the utilization of ILs in pretreatment of Arundo donax L.. Three common ILs, such as [Bmim]BF4, [Bmim]HSO4, and [Amim]Cl, were employed to carry out the comparison study. The solid recovery and delignification during the pretreatment process, the sugar yield during enzymatic hydrolysis process, and hydrogen yield, hydrogen production rate (HPR), and VFAs distribution during the photo-fermentation process were invested to compare the properties of three ILs. Moreover, scatter matrix was used to further analyze the relationship among features (solid recovery, △pH, and delignification) of pretreatment, sugar yield, and hydrogen yield."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Raw materials and photosynthetic bacteria,"2.1 Raw materials and photosynthetic bacteria The raw Arundo donax L. was bought from Nanyang County (Henan province, China). After drying, the giant reed was crushed to pass a 60-mesh sieve, and maintained in a plastic bag without air at room temperature. It composed of 41.4% of carbon (C), 5.7% of Hydrogen (H), 46.8% of oxygen (O), 0.85% of nitrogen (N), and 0.34% of sulfur (S). The photo-fermentative hydrogen production bacteria HAU-M1 was prepared by Henan Agricultural University. The culture medium and more information about the bacteria were previously illustrated in Jiang et al., (2016b)."
3,Pretreatments,"2.2 Pretreatments Three ILs ([Bmim]BF4, [Bmim]HSO4, and [Amim]Cl) were utilized to carry out the pretreatments. About 20 g (dry matter) of Arundo donax L. was soaked by 200 mL different concentrations (g/L) (2, 4, 8, or16) of ionic liquid solutions in a 1-L reactor, respectively. The loaded reactors were covered with sealing film and then maintained at 80 °C for 3 h. After that, a sieve (325 Mesh) was employed to wash the pretreated Arundo donax L. with tap water until the pH of leachate reached to around 7.0. After that, the wasted Arundo donax L. was drained at 45 °C for 48 h for farther utilization."
4,Enzymatic hydrolysis,"2.3 Enzymatic hydrolysis Enzymatic hydrolysis of untreated and pretreated Arundo donax L. was carried out in a 100-mL reactor each including 20 mL of citrate buffer (pH 4.8, 0.05 M). And then each reactor was loaded with 1 g (dry matter) of untreated and pretreated Arundo donax L. and 20 FPU/g solid of the enzyme Cellic CTec2 (Novozymes, Bagsværd, Denmark). All reactors were shaking with 150 rpm at 50 °C. After 72 h, a 2 mL liquid sample was collected to determine the total sugar yield. Each experiment condition ran with three flasks."
5,Photo-fermentative hydrogen production,"2.4 Photo-fermentative hydrogen production Briefly, about 5 g (dry matter) of untreated and pretreated Arundo donax L., 100 mL of hydrogen production medium and 70 mL of photosynthetic bacteria were loaded to a 200-mL transparent reactor. After adjusting the pH value of medium to around 7.0 with 5 M KOH and 5 M HCl, the reactor was covered with a rubber plug connecting a 500-mL Tedlar gas bag (Hede Technology LTD., Dalian, China) for produced gas collection. All reactors were maintained at about 30 ◦C for 96 h and illuminated at 2000 Lux. The produced gas and liquid samples were both collected every 12 h for analysis. Each pretreatment condition was performed with triplicate reactors."
6,Analysis methods,"2.5 Analysis methods The total solid (TS) and volatile solid (VS) were measured on basis of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA, 2005). An elemental analyzer (Vario EL/cube, Germany) was used to test the contents of elements (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and Sulfur) in raw Arundo donax L.. Besides, the content of Oxygen in Arundo donax L. was got based on equation O = 100 - ( C + H + N + S + a s h ) (Jiang et al., 2020). The dinitro salicylic (DNS) colorimetric method was employed to measure the sugar yield (Adney and Baker, 1996). A pH meter (PHS-3C, Shanghai, China) was utilized to measure142 the pH value. The content of lignin of untreated and pretreated Arundo donax L. was determined on basis of the NREL Analytical Procedure described in Sluiter et al., (2008). The delignification was calculated according to equation (1)(Qing et al., 2017). (1) D e l i g n i f i c a t i o n % = 1 - lignininpretreatedsamples × S R lignininnativesamples × 100 % where SR was solid recovery (%). The measurement of gas volume was achieved by utilizing a 60-mL sterile syringe at 30 °C and 1 atm. A gas chromatograph equipped with a 5A molecular sieve packed column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (6820 gc-14b, Agilent Technology, USA) was utilized to determine the content of hydrogen. A gas chromatography equipped with a 30 m × 250 µm × 0.25 µm HP-5 ms Ultra Inert column and a flame ionization detector (FID) (Agilent, HP 7890B) was used to test the VFAs in the liquid medium. The carrier gas was N2. The detailed setting parameters can be found in Jiang et al., (2021b)."
7,Statistical analysis,2.6 Statistical analysis Variance (ANOVA) (α = 0.05) analysis was adopted to run the statistical significance analysis with the software of Mintab 17.
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effect of pretreatment on biomass recovery and delignification,"3.1 Effect of pretreatment on biomass recovery and delignification The pH change, solid recovery rate, and delignification of three ILs pretreated Arundo donax L. are illustrated in Table 1 . [Bmim]BF4 and [Bmim]HSO4 present acidity while [Amim]Cl present neutral on basis of the results of initial and final pH during the pretreatment process (Table 1). Moreover, the initial pH of [Bmim]BF4 and [Amim]Cl cases were positive correlated with ILs loadings, whereas the initial pH of [Bmim]HSO4 had a opposite tendency (Table 1). The lower pH value of [Bmim]HSO4 indicated severe acidity compared to [Bmim]BF4, which was further illustrated by sugar yield in Fig. 1 and hydrogen yield in Fig. 2 a. The solid recoveries of three ILs pretreated Arundo donax L. were all higher than 90 % without significant difference (p > 0.05) among each pretreatment conditions, which were higher than those reported by (Qing et al., 2017), in which the solid recovery of alkali and acid pretreated biomass were in a range of 40 % − 60 %, indicating mid pretreatment method of these three ILs (Table 1). As shown in Table 1, the delignification of [Bmim]BF4, [Bmim]HSO4, and [Amim]Cl pretreatment of Arundo donax L. with different loadings were in ranges of 5.3 %-7.0 %, 6.6 %-7.9 %, and1.7 % −7.2%, respectively, indicating pretreatment with [Bmim]HSO4, was severe than those with the other two ILs since the acid of [Bmim]HSO4 was stronger according to the value of pH at the same loadings in Table 1. The maximum delignification of 7.9 % was observed from 16 g/L [Bmim]HSO4 pretreated Arundo donax L., which was 12.8 % and 9.7 % higher than the maximums observed in [Bmim]BF4 and [Amim]Cl pretreated Arundo donax L.."
10,Effect of ILs pretreatment on sugar yield from enzymatic hydrolysis,"3.2 Effect of ILs pretreatment on sugar yield from enzymatic hydrolysis The effect of ILs pretreatment on sugar yield of Arundo donax L. during enzymatic hydrolysis process is present in Fig. 1. Three ILs pretreatment with different loadings (g/L) (2, 4, 8, and 16) improved the sugar yield of Arundo donax L., except for Arundo donax L pretreated with 2% Bmim]BF4 and 2% [Amim]Cl (Fig. 1). However, no significant distinction (p > 0.05) of sugar yield was observed between each other of 2 % ILs pretreatment of Arundo donax L. according to the statistical analysis. The maximum sugar yield of 7.9 g/L was obtained from Arundo donax L. pretreated with 16 % [Bmim]HSO4, which was 68.8 % higher than that of untreated Arundo donax L. (Fig. 1). The results were consistent with delignification in Table 1. The maximum enhancement of sugar yield (1.7-fold higher of untreated) was comparable with 20 % Ca(OH)2 pretreated Arundo donax L. (2.1-fold higher of untreated) in literature (Jiang et al., 2020). Moreover, sugar yields obtained from different loadings of [Bmim]HSO4 pretreated giant reed biomass were higher than those with same loadings of Bmim]BF4 and [Amim]Cl, indicating [Bmim]HSO4 pretreatment was more suitable for Arundo donax L. in terms of enzymatic hydrolysis (Fig. 1). This might because that [Bmim]HSO4 was more efficient in losing of intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding leading to bigger surface area for enzyme attack compared to other two ILs (Li et al., 2010). Besides, acid pretreatment has also been proved to increase the enzymatic cellulose digestibility, thereby enhanced sugar yield (Singh et al., 2015)."
11,Effect of ILs pretreatment on hydrogen production,"3.3 Effect of ILs pretreatment on hydrogen production As illustrated in Fig. 2a, all three ILs ([Bmim]BF4, [Bmim]HSO4, and [Amim]Cl) pretreatment with loadings of 4 g/L and 16 g/L increased the hydrogen yield of Arundo donax L. from photo-fermentation compared to untreated Arundo donax L. (78.4 mL/g TS). 16 % [Bmim]HSO4 pretreated Arundo donax L. obtianed the highest hydrogen yield of 106.1 mL/g TS, which was 12.0 %, 8.7 % and 35.3 % higher than those of [Bmim]BF4, [Amim]Cl pretreated, and untreated Arundo donax L. with the same loading (16 g/L), respectively (Fig. 2a). The result was consistent with sugar yield in Fig. 1. However, when the loading of ILs was 4 g/L, [Amim]Cl pretreated Arundo donax L. gave the maximum hydrogen yield of 96.3 mL/g TS, which was 0.6 %, 19.6 %, and 22.8 % higher than those of [Bmim]BF4, [Bmim]HSO4 pretreated, and untreated Arundo donax L., which might be because the higher delignification of pretreatment with 4 g/L of [Amim]Cl than those with the other two ILs at the same loading (Table 1 and Fig. 2a). In all, the improved hydrogen yield from ILs pretreatment might be attributed to decrement of biomass crystallinity and weakness of the van der Waals interaction between cell wall polymers, since biomass crystallinity and the van der Waals were proved to be barrier for energy extractive from lignocellulosic biomass (Li et al., 2010). Furthermore, statistical analysis revealed that three ILs pretreatment with 16 g/L loading significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced the hydrogen yield while 4 g/L loading did not significantly (p > 0.05) enhance the hydrogen yield compared to untreated Arundo donax L., indicating ILs pretreatments with higher level of loading (higher than 16 g/L in this study) were efficient in hydrogen yield improvement because of considerable delignification (Table 1 and Fig. 2a). The results substantiated that the strength of acid treatment in a relative range was positively with dissolvement of polymer molecule simultaneously accompanied with the improvement of bioenergy yield (Chozhavendhan et al., 2020). The effect of ILs pretreatment on HPR is present in Fig. 2b, the HRPs of both untreated and 4 g/L [Bmim]HSO4 pretreated Arundo donax L. peaked at 24 h, and untreated Arundo donax L. obtained the highest HPR of 5.1 mL/g TS/h, which was higher than the maximum HPR of 2.6 mL/g TS/h achieved from 2 % NaOH pretreated Arundo donax L. (Jiang et al., 2020) (Fig. 2b). Nevertheless, the highest hydrogen yield obtained from 16 g/L [Bmim]HSO4 pretreated Arundo donax L. was not accompanied by the highest HPR and the shortest peaking time, which might be the reason that easier sugar release caused by more severe pretreatment led to substrate inhibition, thereby lower maximum HPR and longer peaking time (Li et al., 2018). Fig. 3 a showed the time-course of pH during the 96-h photo-fermentation process with untreated and three ILs pretreated Arundo donax L.. In first 24 h, the pH values of untreated and ILs pretreated Arundo donax L. decreased to a range of 5.44–5.75, and then stably kept in a relative narrow range until the end of photo-fermentation except for untreated and 4 g/L [Bmim]HSO4 pretreated Arundo donax L. which slightly increased to about 6.2 (Fig. 3a). The slight increase of pH value might be due to lower sugar accumulation in the medium thus lower acid was generated during the hydrogen production process (Zhu et al., 2020). The time-course of sugar yield is present in Fig. 3b, although simultaneous saccharification and fermentation configuration was used, there was still sugar accumulated during the hydrogen production process since no sugar was observed reported by Jiang et al. (2021b). Moreover, in the general, the sugar yield of ILs pretreated Arundo donax L. was higher than that of untreated Arundo donax L. during the entire process, meaning ILs did enhance the deteriorating polysaccharides to reducing sugar."
12,Soluble metabolic products distribution,"3.4 Soluble metabolic products distribution The VFAs, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, and, butyric acid, and ethanol were the by-products usually found in the liquid medium of photo-fermentative hydrogen production (Jiang et al., 2021b; Zhang et al., 2020). The distributions of acetic acid, butyric acid, and ethanol are present in Fig. 4 . Since the concentration of propionic acid was almost low to zero, the distribution of which was ignored in this study. The distribution of acetic acid during the 96-h photo-fermentative hydrogen production process of untreated and three ILs pretreated Arundo donax L. mainly focused on the range of 5.0–10.0 mM (Fig. 4a). Arundo donax L. pretreated by 16 g/L [Bmim]HSO4 showed a maximum acetic acid concentration of 11.5 mM at 12 h, which might be caused by the stimulation of higher sugar released from pretreated feedstock since the acetic acid was a main by-product of sugar fermentation ( C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 C H 3 C O O H + 2 C O 2 ) (Fig. 4a) (Chozhavendhan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The butyric acid generated during the photo-fermentation of untreated and three ILs pretreated Arundo donax L. distributed in the range of 4.0–6.0 mM after 12 h (Fig. 4b). The orange aera presented during the hydrogen processes of untreated and 4 g/L [Bmim]HSO4 pretreated Arundo donax L. indicated lower butyric acid accumulation, which was corresponding to the result of hydrogen yield (Fig. 4b and Fig. 2a). This might be explained that the hydrogen yield was positive correlated with butyric acid generation based on the equation C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 H 2 + 2 C H 3 C H 2 C O O H + 2 C O 2 (Fig. 4b) (Chozhavendhan et al., 2020). The ethanol distribution was distinguished with those of acetic acid and butyric acid since there was no dominated area in the Fig. 4c. It was noticed that the ethanol concentration observed in [Amim]Cl pretreated Arundo donax L. was higher than those of [Bmim]HSO4 and [Bmim]BF4 pretreated, which might be explained that the residue of [Amim]Cl in recovered biomass partly catalyzed the pathway shifting from hydrogen to alcohol."
13,"Correlation among pretreatment, sugar yield and hydrogen yield","3.5 Correlation among pretreatment, sugar yield and hydrogen yield The correlation among pretreatment features (△pH, solid recovery, and delignification), sugar yield, and hydrogen yield was analyzed with scatter matrix is shown in Fig. 5 . △pH (initial pH subtracted final pH) of pretreatment liquid had negative correlation with solid recovery, delignification, sugar yield, and hydrogen yield since the Pearson’s r were all minus (Fig. 5). Solid recovery was positively related with hydrogen yield, suggesting more solid recovery during the pretreatment process leading to more useful feedstock can take party in hydrogen evolution during the photo-fermentation process (Fig. 5). Moreover, a higher Pearson’s r (0.67) obtained from delignification with sugar yield over that (0.14) with hydrogen yield, indicating hydrogen production behavior was driven by several factors, such as bacteria, fermentative condition, feedstock feature (Fig. 5)(Jiang et al., 2021b; Zhang et al., 2021). The maximum Pearson’s r of 0.74 was observed between sugar yield and hydrogen yield, meaning saccharification of feedstock played a key role in hydrogen production via photo-fermentation, which further illustrated the importance of pretreatment in bioenergy production (Fig. 5). Similar results was reported by (Jiang et al., 2020), in which a positive correlation between glucose yield and hydrogen yield was observed since the carbohydrate used for metabolic activity of hydrogen production bacteria was come from the saccharification of feedstock ."
14,Conclusions,"The maximum sugar yield of 7.9 g/L during the enzymatic hydrolysis and hydrogen yield of 106.1 mL/g TS during the photo-fermentation were both achieved from 16 g/L [Bmim]HSO4 pretreated Arundo donax L., which was 68.8 % and 35.3 % higher than those of untreated Arundo donax L., respectively. 16 g/L [Bmim]HSO4 was effectively superior to the other ILs pretreatments with designed loading, and its liquor reuse would help to achieve cost-effective hydrogen productions via photo-fermentation. Moreover, scatter matrix analysis revealed that saccharification of feedstock played a key role in photo-fermentative hydrogen production."
