0,Introduction,"Fraxinus mandshurica is a deciduous tree of the Oleaceae family and an economically important hard-wood and broad-leaved tree species in the forests of Northeast China. Its wood has a high economic and medicinal value. Fraxinus mandshurica is a light-loving plant with a well-developed root system, although its growth rate is slow (Goto et al., 2006). At present, due to excessive felling and harsh natural conditions such as drought and salinity stress, Fraxinus mandshurica has become one of the endangered species (Chen et al., 2017). Therefore, research pertaining to the functions of lignin biosynthesis genes in Fraxinus mandshurica is of great significance for the cultivation and breeding of this species. Lignin is a phenylpropane compound in the secondary cell wall and the second most abundant biopolymer in plants (Wang et al., 2018). Lignin plays pivotal roles in plant growth and development, cellular mechanical support, and plant responses to biotic or abiotic stress (Humphreys and Chapple, 2002; Cabane et al., 2012). Lignin mainly contains three monomers, namely p-hydroxybenzyl (H-lignin), guaiacyl (G-lignin), and syringyl lignin (S-lignin) (Baucher et al., 1998; Boerjan et al., 2003; Simon et al., 2018), derived from three hydroxycinnamyl alcohol precursors, namely p-coumaroyl, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol, respectively (Baucher et al., 1998; Vanholme et al., 2010). These three lignin monomers are synthesized through the phenylpropane metabolic pathway (Ye et al., 1994; Douglas, 1996; Whetten et al., 1998; Hu et al., 1999; Vanholme et al., 2010; Hao and Mohnen, 2014). G-, S-, and H-lignin contents vary across plant species, and the S/G lignin ratio affects plant growth characteristics (Voelker et al., 2010). 4-Coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) is a key enzyme in the plant phenylpropane pathway, which catalyzes the formation of various biological macromolecules such as lignin precursors and flavones (Becker-André et al., 1991; Ehlting et al., 1999; Boerjan et al., 2003). Recently, 4CL was investigated in various plants such as Arabidopsis, poplar, and rice. Changes in 4CL expression alter the lignin or flavonoid content as well as affect the growth and development of plants (Allina et al., 1998; Lin et al., 2015). In a study by Hu et al. (1998), the inhibition of 4CL expression in poplar reduced lignin content and increased cellulose content. Expression of the antisense 4CL gene reduced lignin content in the xylem of transgenic tobacco, moreover, in transgenic tobacco stems, the xylem appeared brownish, and the molecular structure of lignin was altered (Kajita et al., 1997). Previous studies have confirmed that abiotic and biotic stresses affect 4CL expression. Under severe drought, 4CL gene expression was upregulated in Mexican cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) (Sun et al., 2020). Conversely, 4CL expression was downregulated in basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) under drought stress (Abdollahi et al., 2017). Under salinity stress, 4CL expression in desert poplar was enhanced compared with that in salt-sensitive poplar (Zhang et al., 2015). Injury or fungal attack altered 4CL expression in Arabidopsis thaliana (Ehlting et al., 1999). Taken together, these reports indicate that abiotic and biotic stresses can affect the expression of 4CL and promote the production of defense compounds through the phenylpropane metabolic pathway. Plants contain various small-molecule phenolics, such as p-coumaric acid, coniferyl alcohol, ferulic acid, and sinapyl alcohol, which can be incorporated into plant cell wall and are substrates for the lignin biosynthetic pathway. Phenolics can act as signaling molecules involved in plant–microbe interactions and play key roles in plant defense (Kaeirkoenen and Koutaniemi, 2010; Mandal et al., 2010). Studies have shown that phenolic molecules bind to the cell wall and reduce its elongation (Tan et al., 1992). In wheat, the content of phenolic compounds in the cell wall could be used as an indicator of plant stress resistance (Ma et al., 2019a, 2019b). p-Coumaric acid (p-CA) belongs to the natural ester family of hydroxycinnamic acid compounds and regulates plant growth and metabolism. Studies have shown that exogenous p-CA improves growth by significantly increasing stem length as well as fresh and dry weight and increasing total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents in Salvia miltiorrhiza (Nkomo et al., 2019). Coniferyl alcohol is a natural small-molecule phenolic compound in plants. It has a high economic value and is involved in metabolic pathways, such as lignin and flavonoid biosynthesis, in plants, studies on the specific functions of coniferyl alcohol in plants are scarce (Lv et al., 2018). At present, drought and saline–alkali stress has become some of the greatest threats to plant growth. Water shortage and high salt concentration in soil can cause osmotic and oxidative stress to plants, which negatively affects plant growth (Farooq et al., 2009; Liang et al., 2018; Sarker and Oba, 2019). Drought and salinity tolerance mechanisms in plants have been extensively studied (Sarker and Oba, 2018a, 2018b; 2018c, 2018d); however, few studies have examined the role of 4CL under abiotic stress in plants. In a previous study, we identified 12 4CL/4CL-like family genes from the transcriptome of Fraxinus mandshurica and demonstrated that Fm4CL-like 1 was involved in secondary cell wall development and lignin synthesis (Chen et al., 2019a). Moreover, 4CL2 in the 4CL gene family of Fraxinus mandshurica was isolated and designated Fm4CL2. Here, we selected the Fm4CL2 gene for further study. In xylem, the expression of Fm4CL2 was higher than that of the 11 other 4CL/4CL-like family genes. Therefore, we speculated that Fm4CL2 is involved in xylem formation and growth. To determine its precise function, we overexpressed Fm4CL2 in tobacco (OE-Fm4CL2) and demonstrated that this gene increased coniferyl alcohol content as well as enhanced the drought and osmotic stress tolerance of transgenic tobacco."
1,Material and methods,
2,Plant material and growth conditions,"2.1 Plant material and growth conditions In this study, Nicotiana tabacum Longjiang 911 was used as transgenic and wild-type tobacco. Tobacco seedlings were grown on solid MS medium containing 2% sucrose. From May 15 to September 15, the leaves, xylem, and bark of Fraxinus mandshurica were obtained from the forest farm of Northeast Forestry University, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Fraxinus mandshurica seeds collected from the same location were sterilized with 30% sodium hypochlorite for 20 min, cultured on solid WPM medium containing 2% sucrose, and grown for 2 weeks to obtain Fraxinus mandshurica seedlings. Fraxinus mandshurica seedlings were treated with 0, 150 mM NaCl and 200 mM mannitol for 1 h, 3 h, 6 h and 12 h, respectively, and stored at −80 °C after treatment with liquid nitrogen."
3,Isolation of full-length Fm4CL2 cDNA and establishment of the OE-Fm4CL2 transgenic tobacco line,"2.2 Isolation of full-length Fm4CL2 cDNA and establishment of the OE-Fm4CL2 transgenic tobacco line The Fm4CL2 gene sequence was obtained from Fraxinus mandshurica transcriptome and deposited in GenBank (accession number KJ531401). A phylogenetic tree of the Fm4CL2 and 4CL genes from other species was constructed using MEGA 7.0, and multiple sequence alignment was performed using DNAMAN 6.0. RNA was extracted from Fraxinus mandshurica leaves, and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription. The Fm4CL2 sequence was used to design primers, and the extracted cDNA was used as a template for PCR (Table S1). The Fm4CL2 gene sequence was 1913 bp long and contained a 1653-bp-long open reading frame (ORF), encoding 550 amino acids. PBI121 containing the CaMV 35S promoter was selected as the overexpression vector, digested at the BamHI site, and purified. Vector-linked primers (Table S1) were designed using in-fusion cloning for PCR and purification. The cloning system contained 1 μL of 5 × In-Fusion HD Enzyme Premix (Takara, Cat#639648), 1 μL of the vector, and 3 μL of the purified target gene. The reaction system was incubated at 50 °C for 15 min to obtain a recombinant plasmid (pBI121-Fm4CL2) (Irwin et al., 2012). pBI121-Fm4CL2 was transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 strain using the freeze–thaw method (Weigel and Glazebrook, 2006). A single colony was selected to expand the culture in liquid YEB medium containing 100 mg L−1 rifampicin and 50 mg L−1 kanamycin. When Agrobacterium was in the logarithmic growth phase, 1 mL of the bacterial suspension was added to liquid YEB medium without antibiotics and cultured at 28 °C while shaking at 180–220 rpm for 4–6 h. Next, the suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in sterilized distilled water. Bacterial concertation in the solution was adjusted to obtain the OD600 of 0.3 for transformation. Leaves of tobacco seedlings were cut into small pieces measuring 1 cm × 1 cm and immersed in the engineered bacterial suspension for 4 min. Excess bacterial suspension on the leaf surface was adsorbed using a sterile filter paper. The leaf discs were inoculated on the co-cultivation medium (MS + 0.05 mg L−1 NAA + 0.5 mg L−1 6-BA; pH, 6.0). After co-cultivation in the dark at 26 °C for 3 days, the leaves were transferred to the sterilization medium (MS + 0.05 mg L−1 NAA + 0.5 mg L−1 6-BA + 500 mg L−1 cefotaxime + 25 mg L−1 kanamycin; pH, 6.0) under a light intensity of 2000–10,000 lx, sterilized, and cultured at 26 °C for 1 week. The pre-differentiated leaf explants were then transferred to the selection medium (MS + 0.05 mg L−1 NAA + 0.5 mg L−1 6-BA + 500 mg L−1 cefotaxime + 50 mg L−1 kanamycin; pH, 6.0). The resistant buds were selected and cultivated. The obtained resistant shoots were screened for rooting, and the resistant shoots that could grow on the rooting medium (MS + 0.25 mg L−1 NAA + 50 mg L−1 kanamycin; pH, 6.0) were further used for detection of the transformed genes. DNA and RNA were extracted from transgenic tobacco leaves using the CTAB method, and PCR was performed using DNA as the template and specific primers designed based on full-length Fm4CL2. RNA from transgenic tobacco was reverse transcribed into cDNA. Fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using cDNA as the template and specific primers designed based on Fm4CL2."
4,Analysis of cell wall components,"2.3 Analysis of cell wall components Eight-week-old transgenic and wild-type soil-cultured tobacco seedlings were selected for cell wall composition analysis. The third stem of tobacco was sectioned via freehand slicing. The material was soaked in a drop of 1 mol L−1 hydrochloric acid solution for 3 min, and then 10% phloroglucinol solution was added dropwise. Photomicrographs were obtained immediately under an optical microscope (Pomar et al., 2002). The transgenic and wild-type tobacco plants were dried in an oven at 65 °C to constant weight, ground in a mortar, and passed through an 80 μm mesh sieve. Lignin content was determined using the acetyl bromide method (Iiyama and Wallis, 1990). Cellulose content was determined using concentrated sulfuric acid hydrolysis (Camacho et al., 1996). Hemicellulose content was determined using a method combining hydrochloric acid hydrolysis and the DNS method (Foster et al., 2010). The content of small molecules in the tobacco lignin pathway was determined using ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS). Based on the METLIN database (Zhu et al., 2013), a qualitative analysis of grade and secondary spectra was performed. The qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed using Analyst 1.6.3."
5,Histological analysis of tobacco stem sections,"2.4 Histological analysis of tobacco stem sections The third stem segment of tobacco was cut into 1 cm pieces to prepare paraffin-embedded sections. The segments were fixed in the FAA solution for 3 days, stained with hematoxylin for 3 days, washed in running water, dehydrated in graded ethanol, immersed in paraffin, embedded, sectioned, and finally observed under an optical microscope. Moreover, sections of the third nodal segment of tobacco shoot apex were observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM; S-4800, HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan). Cell wall thickness was measured using Image J."
6,Drought and salt stress treatments of tobacco,2.5 Drought and salt stress treatments of tobacco Transgenic and wild-type tobacco plants grown under normal conditions were transferred to MS medium containing 200 or 300 mM mannitol and 150 or 250 mM NaCl. Growth was observed and documented using photographs. T1 generation seeds of transgenic and wild-type tobacco were sterilized with 3% sodium hypochlorite for 10 min and then sown in ordinary MS or MS medium containing 200 or 300 mM mannitol and 150 or 250 mM NaCl. The number of germinated seeds was recorded every day. The experiment was repeated three times.
7,"Determination of reactive oxygen species, relative conductivity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content","2.6 Determination of reactive oxygen species, relative conductivity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content Two-week-old transgenic and wild-type tobacco plants were treated with 300 mM mannitol and 250 mM NaCl for 3 h, and leaves were sampled for the following experiments. Processed tobacco leaves were stained with 0.1% DAB and 0.1% NBT for 16 h and then de-stained in 95% alcohol before obtaining photographs. Commercial kits (Suzhou Keming Biotechnology Co. Suzhou, China) were used to quantify hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion levels. Tobacco leaves (2 g) were cut into pieces of similar shape and size and immersed in 20 mL distilled water for 12 h. The conductivity of the extract (R1) was measured using a conductivity meter. Water was boiled for 30 min and cooled to room temperature, and conductivity of the leachate (R2) was determined. Relative conductivity was measured using the following formula: R1/R2 × 100%. MDA content was determined using the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) colorimetric method (Sarker and Oba, 2018e, 2018f). Briefly, 2 mL of TCA was added to 0.1 g of tobacco leaves and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was obtained and mixed with 2 mL of 0.6% TBA solution in a boiling water bath for 20 min. Absorbance was measured at 532, 450, and 600 nm. MDA content was determined using the following formula: MDA (μmol·g−1) = 6.45 (A532 - A600) - 0.56 × A450."
8,Transient transformation of Fm4CL2 in Fraxinus mandshurica seedlings,"2.7 Transient transformation of Fm4CL2 in Fraxinus mandshurica seedlings Agrobacterium LBA4404 containing the recombinant PB1121-Fm4CL2 plasmid was cultured in 10 mL liquid LB medium at 28 °C while shaking at 180 rpm overnight. The bacterial suspension was diluted with 50 mL LB liquid medium to obtain the OD600 of 0.1 and cultured until reaching the OD600 of 0.7–0.8. The suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Tissue-cultured Fraxinus mandshurica seedlings were first soaked in a hypertonic solution (liquid 1/4 WPM medium containing 25% sucrose) for 15 min at room temperature and then in the transformation solution (1/2 WPM + 2 mmol L−1 MES + 10 mmol L−1 CaCl2 + 120 μmol L−1 AS + 2% sucrose + 270 mM mannitol + 200 mg L−1 DTT + 0.05% Tween-20) at room temperature while shaking at 90 rpm for 1 h. Next, one-third volume of fresh sterile solution was added, and the culture was incubated for another 1.5 h. The seedlings were transferred to the balance solution (10 mM CaCl2 + 120 μM AS + 3% sucrose + 200 mg L−1 DTT) for less than 3 min. The bacterial solution was dried with a sterile filter paper, and the seedlings were grown on solid WPM medium containing 200 mM mannitol for 3 days. Finally, samples were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen."
9,Total RNA extraction and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR analysis,"2.8 Total RNA extraction and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR analysis Total RNA was extracted using the CTAB method (Zeng et al., 2010). RNA concentration was measured with NanoDrop, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit (Takara, Dalian, China). cDNA was diluted 10 times and used as the template. The specific primers for qRT-PCR are listed in Supplementary Table 1. For fluorescence qPCR, a SYBR Green (TOYOBO) kit was used. PCR was performed in a 20 μL reaction volume containing 6.4 μL of sterile distilled water, 10 μL of THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix, 0.6 μL each of upstream and downstream primers, 0.4 μL of 50 × ROX reference dye, and 2 μL of cDNA template. Fluorescence qPCR was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System. The reaction conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 34 s, 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 95 °C for 15 s; all reactions were repeated three times. Quantitative data were obtained using the 2−ΔΔCT method and processed with IBM SPSS 19."
10,Results,
11,Identification and expression of Fm4CL2,"3.1 Identification and expression of Fm4CL2 Fm4CL2 from Fraxinus mandshurica was cloned, and the sequence is deposited in GenBank (accession number KJ531401). The full-length cDNA of the Fm4CL2 gene is 1653 bp long and encodes 550 amino acids. Plant 4CL genes can be divided into two clades. Class Ⅰis involved in lignin biosynthesis, and class II is involved in biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids other than lignin. Some genes that harbor the same conserved motifs as 4CL and share high similarity with 4CL proteins are classified as class III (4CL-like genes). In previous studies, we identified 12 Fraxinus mandshurica 4CL genes. To understand the evolutionary relationships of these 12 Fm4CLs with the 4CLs of other species and to determine the classes to which these Fm4CLs belong, we selected 46 4CL proteins from 16 species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max, Nicotiana tabacum, Oryza sativa, Pinus taeda, and Populus trichocarpa, and constructed a phylogenetic tree. Evolutionary analysis showed that Fm4CLs share the highest homology with Ptr4CL4 and Ptr4CL17 of poplar. Moreover, Fm4CL2, Fm4CL6, Fm4CL9, Fm4CL11, and Fm4CL12 belong to class I; Fm4CL5 belongs to class II; and Fm4CL-like 1, Fm4CL1, Fm4CL3, Fm4CL7, Fm4CL8, and Fm4CL10 belong to class III (4CL-like) (Fig. 1 ). The sequences of Fm4CL2 and 4CL proteins from other plant species (Arabidopsis and poplar) share 55–70% identity. Our multiple sequence alignments showed that Fm4CL2 contains two motifs that are conserved across the entire 4CL gene family: a putative AMP-binding motif (box I) and a putative CoA-binding site (box II) (Fig. 2 )."
12,The expression patterns of 12 Fm4CL/4CL-like genes,"3.2 The expression patterns of 12 Fm4CL/4CL-like genes Expression patterns may provide clues into the biological functions of genes. Leaves, bark, and xylem from Fraxinus mandshurica were collected from May to September. The spatiotemporal expression patterns of 12 Fm4CL/ 4CL -like family genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3 ). Taking Fm4CL2 expression in May as the control, we found temporal variations in the expression patterns of Fm4CL2 in leaves, bark, and xylem. Fm4CL-like 1 was highly expressed in leaves, while Fm4CL2, Fm4CL5, and Fm4CL11 were highly expressed in the bark. Fm4CL2 and Fm4CL12 expression in the xylem was the highest in July. Fm4CL2 expression in leaves showed an overall upward trend with time, reaching the highest value in September. Fm4CL2 expression in the bark was the highest in June. In the xylem, the expression of Fm4CL2 was higher than that of the other 11 4CL/4CL-like family genes and reached the highest value in July (Fig. 3C), indicating its role in xylem formation and growth. These results indicate that the Fm4CL/ 4CL -like genes show specific spatiotemporal expression patterns. In order to explore whether 12 Fm4CL/ 4CL -like family genes respond to abiotic stress, we investigated the transcription levels of Fm4CL genes under mannitol and NaCl treatment conditions by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3D). We found that Fm4CL2, Fm4CL-like 1, Fm4CL11 were significantly induced to express after 1 h of mannitol treatment, and the expression of Fm4CL2 and Fm4CL-like 1 increased significantly after 3 h of NaCl treatment, while the other 9 Fm4CL genes were not induced under these two stresses. These results indicate that Fm4CL2, Fm4CL-like 1, Fm4CL11 may be involved in the adaptation of Fraxinus mandshurica to drought and salt stress."
13,Fm4CL2 confers drought and salinity stress tolerance,"3.3 Fm4CL2 confers drought and salinity stress tolerance Based on the spatiotemporal expression patterns of 12 Fm4CL/ 4CL -like family genes and their expression patterns in response to osmotic stress, we speculate that Fm4CL2 may be involved in drought and salt stress response. To further explore the function of Fm4CL2, we used Agrobacterium-mediated leaf disc transformation of tobacco plants to establish a transgenic line expressing Fm4CL2. qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of Fm4CL2 mRNA in transgenic tobacco. We obtained 5 independent transgenic lines with high Fm4CL2 expression, and selected OE1, OE2 and OE4 for the following experiments (Supplementary Fig. 1). We investigated the growth changes in transgenic (OE-Fm4CL2) and wild-type tobacco under control and stress conditions. Two-week-old transgenic and wild-type tobacco plants were grown in MS medium with 200 or 300 mM mannitol and 150 or 250 mM NaCl. Phenotypic changes were observed, and root length and fresh weight were measured after 14 days (Fig. 4 A). Under control conditions, the root length and fresh weight were not significantly different between transgenic and wild-type tobacco plants. Under osmotic stress treatment, the root length and fresh weight of transgenic tobacco were higher than those of wild-type tobacco (Fig. 4A–C). We then measured the germination rates of transgenic and wild-type tobacco seeds under control and osmotic stress conditions (Fig. 4D). Under control conditions, there was no significant difference in seed germination rates between transgenic and wild-type tobacco. Under osmotic stress, the seed germination rate of transgenic tobacco was significantly higher than that of wild-type tobacco. These results indicate that Fm4CL2 overexpression increases the tolerance of tobacco to osmotic stress. Under abiotic stress, plants produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species, which damage the plant body, leading to lipid peroxidation and enzyme inactivation (Baxter et al., 2014). Therefore, we assessed changes in reactive oxygen species levels of transgenic and wild-type tobacco under treatment with 300 mM mannitol and 250 mM NaCl using a quantitative staining method. Under control conditions, there were no significant differences in hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion levels between transgenic and wild-type tobacco; however, under mannitol and NaCl treatment, wild-type tobacco accumulated more hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion than transgenic tobacco (Fig. 5 A–C). Simultaneously, we measured changes in MDA content and relative conductivity of transgenic and wild-type tobacco under mannitol and NaCl treatment. Under control conditions, the MDA content and relative conductivity of transgenic and wild-type tobacco were similar; however, under mannitol and NaCl treatment, the MDA content and relative conductivity of wild-type tobacco were higher than those of transgenic tobacco (Fig. 5D–E). These results indicate that Fm4CL2 improves the free radical scavenging ability of plants under stress, thereby improving the tolerance of tobacco to drought."
14,Fm4CL2 plays an important role in lignin biosynthesis,"3.4 Fm4CL2 plays an important role in lignin biosynthesis To further understand the functions of Fm4CL2, the contents of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose were measured in transgenic tobacco. The OE4 line with the highest Fm4CL2 expression was selected for cell wall composition analysis. Lignin content in transgenic tobacco was approximately 58.9% higher than that in wild type (P < 0.05) (Fig. 6 A). There was no significant difference in cellulose content between transgenic and wild-type tobacco (Fig. 6B). Hemicellulose content in transgenic tobacco was decreased by 41.2% compared with that in wild type (Fig. 6C). To further understand the role of Fm4CL2 in the lignin biosynthetic pathway, we determined the contents of small-molecule phenolics in this pathway. Coniferyl alcohol content was significantly increased (by 250%) but p-coumaric acid content was decreased (by 48%) in transgenic tobacco compared with values in wild type (Fig. 6D). In addition, the stems and petioles of transgenic tobacco were sectioned and stained with phloroglucinol–HCl (Fig. 6E). Based on xylem staining, the lignin content of transgenic tobacco was higher than that of wild type, indicating that Fm4CL2 promoted lignin deposition. These results demonstrate that Fm4CL2 overexpression contributes to lignin accumulation in tobacco."
15,Fm4CL2 altered the xylem structure of transgenic tobacco,"3.5 Fm4CL2 altered the xylem structure of transgenic tobacco The third stem segment of transgenic and wild-type tobacco plants was sectioned and observed (Fig. 7 A). The number of cell layers in the xylem of the stem in transgenic tobacco was increased by 120% compared with the number in wild-type tobacco (Fig. 7B). SEM observations (Fig. 7C) revealed that cell wall thickness was significantly increased in transgenic tobacco compared with that in wild-type tobacco. Cell wall thickness in wild-type and transgenic tobacco was 1.89 ± 0.38 and 2.92 ± 0.28 μm, respectively, indicating that the cell wall thickness in transgenic tobacco was increased by 54.5% compared with the value in wild-type tobacco (Fig. 7D)."
16,Fm4CL2 regulates the expression of drought stress response genes in Fraxinus mandshurica,"3.6 Fm4CL2 regulates the expression of drought stress response genes in Fraxinus mandshurica Fraxinus mandshurica seedlings were transiently transfected with 35S–Fm4CL2, treated with 200 mM mannitol. Fm4CL2 expression in transgenic and control plants was detected by qRT-PCR (Fig. 8 A). Fm4CL2 expression in transgenic plants was 15.6 times higher than that in control plants. We selected drought stress response genes, including FmPAL1, FmZFP1, FmCAT1, FmHAK5, FmAPX1, FmSOS1, FmNHX1, FmDREB26, FmABRE5, and FmSnRK2, from the transcriptome of Fraxinus Mandshurica to explore the roles of Fm4CL2 in drought stress response pathways at the molecular level. Under mannitol treatment, the expression levels of FmPAL1, FmZFP1, FmCAT1, FmNHX1, and FmSnRK2 in transgenic seedings were upregulated respectively by 4.2-, 2.3-, 3.6-, 5.8-, and 6.1-fold compared with values in control plants (Fig. 8B). Therefore, Fm4CL2 is a positive regulator of the response of Fraxinus mandshurica to drought stress."
17,Discussion,"Fraxinus mandshurica has excellent wood properties. In this study, we investigated the role of Fm4CL2 in lignin biosynthesis and stress response. 4CL plays an important role in plant xylem formation. 4CL is a key enzyme controlling carbon fixation pathways by regulating the biosynthesis of lignin, flavonoids, and coumarin in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway. The 4CL gene has been extensively studied in many lineages of vascular plants, but little is known about the 4CL gene in Fraxinus mandshurica. Based on the transcriptomic data of Fraxinus mandshurica, we identified 12 4CL family genes and cloned the true 4CL gene, designated Fm4CL2, which harbors the two 4CL gene family conserved motifs—box I (SSGTTGLPKGV) and box II (GEICIRG) (Allina et al., 1998). We then explored the functions of Fm4CL2 in transgenic tobacco plants. To date, the 4CL family genes from Arabidopsis, rice, and Pinus taeda, among other plants, have been identified and isolated. Plant 4CL genes can be divided into two categories. Class I genes are involved in lignin synthesis, and class II gens are involved in flavonoid synthesis (Ehlting et al., 1999; Cukovic et al., 2001; Hamberger and Hahlbrock, 2004). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Fm4CL2 gene does not share the same branch as the 4CL genes in rice and Arabidopsis thaliana, and the Fm4CL2 gene is more closely related to the Ptr4CL gene in poplar. This may be explained by the differences between herbaceous plants and woody plants during the course of plant evolution. 4CL shows a wide spectrum of substrate specificities; it can catalyze the synthesis of CoA esters corresponding to coumaric acid, caffeic acid, 5-hydroxyferulic acid, and sinapic acid and then participate in the phenylpropane pathway to synthesize lignin and flavonoids, among other metabolites (Lavhale et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019b). In lignified tissues of aspen (Populus tremuloides), the specific substrate for Pt4CL1 is p-coumaric acid (Hu et al., 1998). In the gymnosperm Pinus taeda, there are two 4CL isoforms, namely Pinta4CL1 and Pinta4CL2; Pinta4CL1 is highly expressed in the xylem and shows no obvious substrate specificity (Harding et al., 2002), whereas Pinta4CL2 is highly expressed and shows high substrate specificity for p-coumaric acid (Zhang and Chiang, 1997). Our previous studies showed that Fm4CL2 is highly expressed in the bark and xylem of Fraxinus mandshurica. Fm4CL2 expression increased within 1–3 days after tension treatment (including tension wood and opposite wood) (Chen et al., 2019a), and the expression of Fm4CL2 increases under mannitol and salt stress, which is consistent with the result reported by Zhang and Chiang, 1997 that compressional stress promoted 4CL activity against 4-coumaric acid in Pinus taeda. To determine the functions of Fm4CL2, we measured cell wall components of Fm4CL2 transgenic tobacco. The results showed that compared with wild-type, transgenic tobacco showed increased lignin content (by 58.9%) and decreased hemicellulose content (by 41.2%), although the cellulose contents were similar. This is consistent with the trends reported by Hu et al. (2019) in poplar: Pto4CL1 expression increased lignin content but reduced cellulose and hemicellulose contents (Hu et al., 2019). Therefore, Fm4CL2 may act as a positive regulator of lignin synthesis. To further understand the precise step in the lignin biosynthetic pathway at which Fm4CL2 is involved, we measured the contents of key compounds in this pathway. In transgenic tobacco, p-coumaric acid content was reduced by approximately 48%, while coniferol content was significantly increased by 250%. These results indicate that p-coumaric acid may be the specific substrate of Fm4CL2, and the substantial increase in coniferyl alcohol content indicates that Fm4CL2 catalyzes the formation of p-coumaroyl from p-coumaric acid and then enters the G-lignin synthesis pathway branch of the phenylpropane pathway. Based on these results, Fm4CL2 may be a class I 4CL isoform. SEM observations of the xylem and cell wall structure of transgenic tobacco revealed that the xylem and cell wall of transgenic tobacco were respectively 120% and 54.5% thicker than those of wild type. Hemicellulose and lignin are covalently cross-linked in the cell wall (Terrett and Dupree, 2019), and lignin supports the cell wall. A marked increase in lignin content in transgenic tobacco may promote covalent cross-linking of lignin and hemicellulose, thereby thickening the cell wall (Buanafina, 2009). Meanwhile, studies have demonstrated that the S/G lignin ratio affects plant cell wall structure (Wagner et al., 2015). A marked increase in the content of the G-lignin precursor coniferol in Fm4CL2 transgenic tobacco may reduce the S/G lignin. Phenolics are essential for cell wall assembly, and coniferol accumulation in transgenic tobacco may affect cell wall structure. In conclusion, the thickening of cell wall in transgenic tobacco may be due to increased lignin content and altered S/G lignin ratio. The cell wall serves as a line of defense against adverse external environment, and its structural changes affect the plants’ ability to adapt to biotic or abiotic stress. Previous studies have shown that the phenylpropane pathway is one the crucial plant stress adaptation mechanisms (Agati et al., 2013), and it dominates several metabolic pathways related to pathogen defense, salinity stress, and plant growth and development, including flavonoid and lignin biosynthesis (Zhang et al., 2015). In recent years, there has been some research into the roles of 4CL in plant stress resistance. Under drought, 4CL expression was significantly increased in basil (Khakdan et al., 2017). Our previous studies confirmed that Fm4CL-like 1 enhanced the drought tolerance of transgenic tobacco (Chen et al., 2019a). We speculated that Fm4CL2 is involved in response to abiotic stress. To test this, transgenic and wild-type tobacco plants were treated with mannitol and NaCl. Transgenic tobacco showed better growth characteristics than wild-type tobacco under drought and osmotic stress, perhaps due to the Fm4CL2-induced increase in cell wall thickness. Under mannitol and NaCl treatment, transgenic tobacco accumulated lower levels of hydrogen peroxide and MDA than wild type. The greater the damage to the plant, the higher the hydrogen peroxide and MDA accumulation. Studies have confirmed that phenolic substances in plants can enhance antioxidant potential (Kaeirkoenen and Koutaniemi, 2010; Ma et al., 2019a, 2019b), which is consistent with our results. We speculate that increased coniferol content of transgenic tobacco confers high abiotic stress tolerance."
18,Conclusions,"Fm4CL2 overexpression in tobacco increases drought and osmotic stress tolerance. Fm4CL2 increases the lignin content of transgenic tobacco by increasing coniferol content and p-coumaric acid utilization, thereby improving the plants’ ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species to enhance abiotic stress tolerance."
