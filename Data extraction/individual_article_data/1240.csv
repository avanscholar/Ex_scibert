0,Introduction,"The composite nanomaterials with both inner and outer layers of various metals at nanoscale dimension are termed as core-shell nanoparticles. In general, the core-shell nanostructure is a type of biphasic nanomaterials with an inner core and an outer shell made of multiple components [1]. These nanostructures can be classified into simple core shell or composite nanoparticles based on single or multiple components. In particular, simple nanoparticles are made up of a single material, whereas composite core-shell particles comprise two or more components. Recent advancements in nanomaterials revealed numerous strategies for the facile synthesis, morphology control and analysis of their surface properties for the targeted research applications. These core-shell nanomaterials exhibit distinct boundaries and are recognized independently. A schematic of a typical core-shell structure is shown in Fig. 1 . Further, the core-shell materials are classified into several types such as (i) spherical core/shell nanoparticles; (ii) multiple small cores surrounded by single shell (iii) hexagonal shaped core/shell nanoparticles; (iv) movable core inside hollow shell and (v) nanomatryushka material based on type of the core and nature of surrounding shells [2]. There has been a gradual rise the in the demand for more and more advanced materials driven by the requirements of contemporary technology. At the same time, the development of characterization methods has also significantly helped to create the structures of these distinct core-shell nanostructures. Furthermore, diverse ranges of core-shell metal nanostructures are classified based on (i) nature of the material (ii) shape and size of the nanostructure [3]. Metallic core can either be surrounded by organic layer or an inorganic metal component and vice versa. Depending upon the end application, the core-shell metal nanostructures with different shapes such as cube, hexagon, octahedron, disk, tube, rod, hollow tubular etc. will be designed. Both size and shape of the nanostructure influences physical, chemical, electrical, electrochemical and catalytic properties of materials. Being task-specific nanomaterials the core-shell nanostructure with interesting properties find potential applications in the field of catalysis, nanoelectronics, bionanotechnology, solar cells, optical devices, energy storage and energy conversion devices etc. [4]. The core-shells acquire specific structures through the integration of component properties not associated with their individual component metals. The metal with the prevalent cohesive energy (the primary factor) constitutes the core of the core-shell nanoparticles formed from different groups. The metal with the smallest Wigner-Seitz radius (the secondary factor) dictates the core-shell choice for the core-shell nanoparticles shaped by atoms within a group, where the tiniest atom goes into the core to help alleviate compressive strain. The two self-determining main factors-are the cohesive energy and the Wigner-Seitz radius (atomic size) only. The metal with the high cohesive energy (the primary factor) goes into the core for core-shell nanoparticles formed from various groups. Hence it follows that the core-shell nanoparticles find extensive applications in catalytic research due to their selectivity, efficiency and chemical/physical stability. Noble metals such as Pt, Pd, Ag and Au play a significant role part in various catalytic and electrocatalytic processes among which Pd is known to act as an efficient catalyst for the oxidation/electro-oxidation of small organic molecules, carbon monoxide oxidation, hydrogen oxidation, hydrogenation, coupling reactions and oxygen reduction [5,6]. Among these, the alcohol oxidation is of prime importance as they are central for fuel cell catalysis. The Pd core-shell nanostructure supported by different materials present higher catalytic activity due to the presence of increased surface active centers, high surface area and extended reactive zones [7,8]. Some exceptions exists for the systems consisting of 4d and 5d components controlled by the unified energy because the gap between the atomic radii is too small [9]. The core-shell structures comprising inexpensive non-noble core metal surrounded by a noble metal shell shall further increase the development of low-cost fuel cell applications catalysts. High catalytic performance of the Pd for these reactions makes this material highly promising for many applications such as in drug delivery, imaging, fuel cells, and electrochemical sensors. Pd can be considered as a potential alternate for Pt due to its high catalytic performance and selectivity. The interesting physicochemical properties of Pd core-shell nanostructure offer enhanced catalytic efficiency along with good stability. The interest in Pd-based catalyst stems from its comparable activity and low-cost than Pt and also for its improved electrochemical performance under alkaline conditions. In several electrocatalytic applications, Pd received increasing attention as a potential replacement for Pt. Pd alloys have been demonstrated as a good substitute, yet highly active and stable electrocatalyst for polyol oxidation in alkaline media and considered as a possible substitute for Pt [10]. However, the relative complexity of alcohol oxidation over Pd surface due to adsorbed intermediates, the role of water adsorption residue and molecular structure of the adsorbed species are to be addressed to enhance electrode kinetics. For example, CO molecules formed as an intermediate poisons the active Pd sites and prevent further alcohol oxidation. Due to the maximized use of catalytic locations available for alcohols, Pd electrocatalyst with distinct morphologies appears to exhibit an outstanding electrocatalytic performance towards polyhydric alcohol oxidation compared to mono hydric alcohol oxidation. However, the cost of Pd increased in the last 3 years due to the elevated demand from the automotive sectors (catalytic converters). Nevertheless, Pd continues to be a promising replacement for Pt in electrocatalysis as it is 50 times more abundant than Pt. In the periodic table, both Pt and Pd belong to the same group and they possess fcc structure. Therefore, they both are expected to exhibit similar activity. The Pd nanostructures received attention due to their fascinating properties as well as application in diverse fields such as nanoelectronics, portable devices, nanotechnology, catalysis etc., As a result, the Pd nanostructures are synthesized with well-defined geometry and organization [11–14]. The physico-chemical properties of Pd nanostructures can be tuned by combining other metallic components to get the core-shell architecture. The properties of Pd core-shell architectures are influenced by (i) nature of metallic component (ii) core-shell ratio. Eventually, the core-shell nanostructures exhibit unique characteristics when combined together that are highly advantageous to precisely design Pd core-shell architectures (PCA) to suit diverse utilization requirements. In addition, the PCA is beneficial as they possess novel surface functionalities with good stability, possibility of processing and dispersing, improved activity of Pd, cost-effective than Pt, and biocompatible. The core-shell structures with low-cost non-noble cores surrounded by noble metals can lead to further improvements in the production of low-cost fuel cell analyzers [15]. In practice, only the noble catalytic material is preferably placed over the surface where the catalytic reactions happen and the rate of the electrochemical reaction is unaffected by the nature of core materials. The core-shell nanostructures offer a strategy to minimize the use of a noble metal, to fine-tune the surface composition and arrangement of atoms. Moreover, they also promote improved activity and stability of the electrocatalyst. The Pd based core-shell electrocatalysts are explicitly advantageous for direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFC), which are renewable power generating devices fed with alcohols namely methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol. The DAFC show high volumetric energy density and are easy to operate with simplified system design [16]. Global demand for energy and rising concerns about the environmental protection stimulated interest towards the DAFCs. Fig. 2 represents the operating principle of the DAFC. Despite of many advantages, lack of highly efficient cost-effective electro catalyst is still a major bottleneck that hinders the real time application of DAFCs [17,18]. There are several major attempts to design new catalysts methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol have a relatively high efficiency as that of hydrocarbons [19,20]. Significant advancements were made in the synthesis of catalyst material, electrode structure, electrolytes, theoretical perceptive of gas diffusion and fuel cell engineering for the DAFCs application [21–26]. DAFCs suffer from its own limitations and advantages based on the type of alcohol used as a fuel. Further, the accelerated alcohol oxidation rate and oxygen reduction reactions in alkaline DAFCs raised the option of employing less expensive metal catalysts such as Ag, Ni and Pd that makes the alkaline DAFC as an inexpensive technology particularly in comparison to the DAFC technology operating under acidic conditions that employ Pt catalysts [27,28]. This is especially more beneficial for the mobile applications, as it seeks to avoid the need for a heavy and costly reformer. In this direction, the DAFCs have been comprehensively considered and deliberated as possible power production systems for portable electronic devices and vehicles in the near future [29]. This review emphasizes different approaches for PCA nanostructures synthesis, factors affecting size, shape, relation between structure and activity towards alcohol oxidation and its application to design electrode materials for alcohol-fed fuel cells. The emerging research trends are based on PCA nanostructures. Several research groups have shown interest to develop PCA based electrocatalyst that suits fuel cell [30]. The core-shell architecture provides an efficient strategy to enhance the efficiency of expensive metal catalysts. It is possible to fabricate highly active the PCA with high surface to volume ratio and good utilization efficacy by changing the outer core material with less or non-expensive metal that helps to minimize the overall cost of the system. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the Pd catalyzed processes devoted to the oxidation of mono/polyhydric alcohols that occurs at the anodic side of alcohol-fed low temperature fuel cells. The potential application of DAFCs in transportable electronic devices has been attractive due to its growing significance of their high efficiency, low harmful emissions and facile systems. The core-shell nanostructures can be used as a sort of phase separation of an alloy into a core component encircled by a metallic shell. Such nanostructures have two important features: First, the use of a low-cost metal core and a noble metal over layer to create the core-shell structure that offer significant cost reduction. Secondly, the pure Pt deposited on a non-Pt substrate surface show substantially a varied electrocatalytic surface activity. The electrochemical oxidation of small organic molecules on core-shell based electro catalysts is of considerable interest in recent years because of its possible utility in electrooxidation. The PCA are very attractive for fuel-cell electrocatalysis. Extensive research efforts are being directed towards the development and application of PCA for the electro-oxidation of methanol, formic acid, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol. Herein, we discussed the outcome of numerous research articles in this topic. The core-shell or core-shell-like nanostructures are bestowed with multifunctionality metallic nanoparticles with an average diameter between 2 and 5 nm that functions as electrocatalysts. Nowadays with the increasing complexity of core-shell nanoparticles, the analysis of function-property-relationships becomes very essential and crucial than the development of novel catalysts. Moreover, the structure/nature of core as well as porosity of the shell predominantly determines the rate of diffusion of reactants that is controlled by the modification of nanostructure. The catalytic activity of the PCA is significantly enhanced by their distinctive morphology wherein each metal nanoparticle core is prevented from aggregation by the outer protective shell and offer more exposed active sites. While, the core-shell nanostructures are used as catalyst, it resembles homogenous catalysts and the reaction environment is confined. Due to all these advantages of the core-shell nanostructures, there are plenty of interest amongst researchers to develop electrocatalysts based core-shell morphology for alcohol oxidation with higher selectivity, minimal intermediate steps and improved kinetics. These systems provide numerous benefits over their heterogeneous counterparts in terms of their structure, properties of the catalyst and improved selectivity. The shape and compositions of core-shell nanostructures are therefore crucial in optimizing the electrocatalytic efficiency of alcohol oxidation. The anti-poison activity and enhanced alcohol oxidation of the PCA are very much dependent on the well-defined geometry, favorable core-shell composition and synergistic effect between the component materials."
1,Role of core-shell morphology for electrocatalysis,"1.1 Role of core-shell morphology for electrocatalysis It is well known that the core-shell nanostructure's shape and surface composition are strongly related to their catalytic efficiency such as activity and durability. Many functional catalysts are designed based on the fact that there exists a relationship between the core-shell structure and electrocatalytic properties. Designing an electrocatalyst is one of the critical challenges as the catalyst should be highly performing, efficient, cost-effective and ecofriendly. The core-shell morphology is principally beneficial because it is possible to control precisely the material properties of core-shell materials. Appropriate choice of metal enables to minimize the cost of the system. Further, the synergistic effects operating between the components help to promote the catalytic efficiency. The electrocatalytic activity of core-shell catalyst is determined by the synergistic interactions between the core and shell that allows fabrication of task-specific electrocatalyst with superior electrocatalytic efficiency. There are three major factors that are known to influence the electrocatalytic activity and they are ligand effect, ensemble effect and geometric effect. The bimetallic interactions are mainly governed by (i) contact between the core and the shell due to the atomic proximity that affects the charge transfer between the materials thereby altering the band-structures (ii) adsorption of content on the surface caused by the presence of different atomic groups (iii) disparity in surface atom reactivity due to their three dimensional structural constraints [31–35]. Since, the core-shell morphology offers expedient facile route to achieve task-specific electrocatalysts, it is very easy to control the typical average size of the nanostructure. The presence of a core alters the electronic structure of shell material through chaining its Fermi electron density level in such a way that the binding ability of intermediates gets lowered thereby minimizing the energy barrier for the oxidation of adsorbates. Also understanding structure-property relationships help to design new catalyst with superior efficiency and selectivity. Fig. 3 illustrates the favorable modification of D-band level in core-shell nanostructure that facilitates the reaction kinetics. Due to the operation of electronic effect core-shell outperforms both individual components and bimetallic counterparts. Further variation in the binding energy levels associated with the core-shell structure is able to cause a decreased adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates that helps to promote reaction rates. The physical and chemical properties of the core-nanoparticles are primarily related to the materials and composition of the core and shell, but are also connected to the interface. One advantage of the core-shell nanoparticle is the shell-material coating. Further the core material parameters such as reactivity can be reduced and the thermal stability can be optimized to increase the overall particle stability and core particle dispersibility. The other advantage is that the shell material can provide surface chemistry for further modification and functionalization of the nanomaterials."
2,Alcohol electro-oxidation over the core-shell nanostructures,
3,mechanism of alcohol electro-oxidation over the core-shell nanostructures,"2.1 mechanism of alcohol electro-oxidation over the core-shell nanostructures Alcohol oxidation plays a central role to implement sustainable energy economy. The alcohols are attractive as fuel in such a scheme, but their selectivity and complete oxidation is challenging due to the involvement of multi-electron transfer process accompanied by a number of sequential intermediate steps. On these grounds, a comprehensive interpretation of the mechanism involved must be understood properly to design and develop efficient and selective catalysts. The structure and morphology of electrocatalyst, and degree of alloying are known to influence the catalytic mechanism during the electrooxidation of alcohol. The complete oxidation of monohydric alcohol involves water molecule and adsorbed residue (OHads) in presence of oxygen. Pd based nanoalloys have been demonstrated to be highly active and stable electrocatalyst for polyol oxidation in alkaline media and considered as economical substitutes for Pt. Both Pd and Pt possess similar characteristics in terms of crystal structure, atomic size and also they belong to the same group in the periodic table. Researchers are currently encountering a major roadblock in commercializing fuel cells: the high cost of catalysts, especially Pt. Aside from the cost, Pt was discovered to have a low reactivity on ethanol when compared to the success it has had in methanol fuel cell research. Although Pt is recognized as best catalyst for fuel cell catalysis, there is relentless monitoring amid researchers to find suitable alternate to Pt. Being belong to same group with more electropositive character, many researchers found Pd as a suitable substitute for replacing Pt. Furthermore, since the pH environment for Pd to excel must be higher than 8, a large number of co-catalysts are available. Pd is less expensive than Pt in terms of price, which may lower the cost of experimental work and research. In acidic media, Pd is the least reactive catalyst; however, as compared to Pt, Pd outperformed Pt in alkaline media. Following this line, we intend to analyze research works focused on Pd based alloys because there are Pt based materials has been reviewed by many researchers and Pt based catalysts is one the most studied one. In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to the designing of nanostructured Pd materials because of the high proportion of surface to bulk atoms. Since Pd research is still in its early stages, we attempted studies focusing on Pd based materials rather Pt based ones. Pd is believed to be a suitable substitute for alcohol electrocatalysis due to its natural abundance. However, the relative complexity of alcohol oxidation over the Pd surface due to adsorbed intermediates, role of water adsorption residue and molecular structure of adsorbed species needs to be addressed to enhance electrode kinetics. For example, CO molecules formed as a reaction intermediate would poison the active Pd sites and prevent further alcohol oxidation. This necessitates the tuning of the anode electrocatalyst to favor the partial oxidation of the polyalcohol with high selectivity. Therefore, the alcohol oxidation mechanism in alkaline media is a priority for the design and production of effective assembly for fuel cells. Since, the molecular reactivity depends on nature and structure of Pd catalyst, many on-going efforts focus on the improvement in catalytic activity and selectivity of Pd catalyst. This was achieved by increasing the active surface area and by the addition of a second metal with a promotional effect. The curiosity in Pd based catalyst originates from its natural abundance and low cost than Pt. Furthermore, the enhanced electrochemical kinetics of Pd based catalysts in alkaline media is very attractive as also due to the maximum utilization of catalytic surface sites available for polyols, the Pd electrocatalysts with unique morphology apparently display excellent electrocatalytic performances towards the polyol oxidation than other metals. Xu et al., has carried out a detailed investigation on the de-poisoning effect of alloys and reported that alloying Pt with Pd decreased the number of active catalytic centers that inhibits the existence of the three adjacent sites essential for strong adsorption of the reaction intermediate [36]. With PtPd alloy, it may be noted that only two adjacent active catalyst sites are available that effectively eliminates catalyst poisoning and promotes alcohol oxidation reaction. The mechanism is as follows: (1) Pt + CH3OH → Pt–(CO)ads + 4H+ + 4e− (2) Pt–(CO)ads + H2O → Pt + CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− The optimal Pd content is essential for the enhanced electroactivity of the alloy electrode that is found to enhance the surface composition comprising Pt0.9Pd0.1 alloy film (wt. %) as claimed by this study [37]. This synergistic effect is pronounced maximum under alkaline conditions than acidic and neutral media. Many reports concur with the same results that Pt–Pd performs better than Pt [38,39]. In general, the oxidation of alcohol over metal-based surface involves two different reactions namely: (i) mechanistic way accompanied with COads intermediate (ii) mechanistic way wherein C–C bond breakage doesn't happen [40]. The Pt based catalysts are used as model to achieve Pd based alcohol oxidation. The oxidation of alcohol occurs via three different paths and the products formed may be acetaldehyde, acetic acid or carbon dioxide. Unlike the Pt, Pd based catalysts are reactive only in the alkaline medium and they selectively attack C–C bond. On the Pd-based electrocatalysts ethanol is selectively converted to acetate on the condition (Pt component should be absent) and the anode solution is highly alkaline. However, acetaldehyde is not a by-product in the exhausts of cells in any case although traces of carbonate is frequently observed. Recently, with aid of in situ FTIR spectroelectrochemistry, chemo selectivity of ethylene glycol ethanol electro oxidation on Pd has been examined by the using a smooth Pd electrode at various pH. The oxidation kinetics was found to be significantly dependent on the pH of electrolyte [41]. A peak current was observed at pH 14, while the activity decreased below or above 1.0 moL dm−3 NaOH. The behavior was already extremely weak at pH 12. A high concentration of hydroxyl groups is essential to promote the oxidation reaction on Pd as evident from the results. However, when the surface coverage of catalyst is more than optimal range (under high pH conditions) the rate of adsorption is adversely affected that may lead to lower turnover number/catalyst performance. It has been also experimentally demonstrated the ability of Pd to depress C–C bond cleavage, resulting in lower over potential and longer lifetime of the catalyst, by examining ethylene glycol oxidation in alkaline media using PtPd, PtPdBi and PtBi as catalysts [42]. The addition of Bi to Pt resulted in reduced onset potential of EG electro oxidation of about 70 mV and aid to obtain higher current densities in the whole studied potential range. It has been shown that the addition of foreign atoms to Pd has led to a reduction in the catalyst's ability to break the C–C bond. It was proposed that presence of additional metal not only primarily favors the adsorption of –OH species but also affects the distribution of the species. Consequently, presence of Pd help to mitigate poisoning of active Pt catalytic centers through altering the composition of chemisorbed species. It is widely accepted that all alcohols are oxidized subsequently through two distinct reactive paths: a path concerning intermediate COads and a path that involve no C–C bond breaking [43]. On Pd-based electrocatalysts ethanol is selectively converted to acetate when no Pt surface is available and the anode solution is highly alkaline. The adsorption and oxidation pathways of ethylene glycol over polycrystalline Pd surfaces in alkaline media was investigated through in-situ FTIR spectroscopy and CV by Wang et al., to understand the electrooxidation mechanism [44]. A detailed investigation through CV revealed that ethanol oxidation is the rate determining step accompanied by adsorption of hydroxyl groups over Pd surface and involves the mechanism shown below [45]. (3) Pd + OH− → Pd-OHads + e− (4) Pd-(CH3CH2OH)ads + 3OH− → Pd-(COCH3)ads + 3H2O + 3 e− (5) Pd-(COCH3)ads + Pd-OHads → Pd–CH3COOH + Pd This also confirmed that high oxidation activity requires a delicate equilibrium of ethanol and hydroxyl ion concentration because the presence of any one of this species on the catalyst surface may impede the required adsorption of both species. Moreover, acetaldehyde is also suggested to be an effective intermediate when the ethanol oxidation reaction occurs over Pd surface. Recently, a justification was suggested for the operation of Pd-based electrocatalysts for ethanol oxidation under alkaline conditions [46]. Unlike in alkaline media, the dehydrogenation of ethanol in acidic media is very difficult due to the lack of adsorbed hydroxyl species on the Pd surface, this was verified by DFT calculations on model Pd clusters [47] also. It has been shown that Pd displays a strong electrocatalytic behavior for the oxidation of ethylene glycol oxidation under alkaline conditions at a low onset and strong current densities that may vary with pH and the supporting electrolyte. The abovementioned pathway is possible for methanol that consists of only one carbon atom. A widely accepted reaction scheme for ethanol oxidation on Pt-based catalysts can be divided into three pathways that can result in the formation of either acetaldehyde or acetic acid and carbon dioxide. However, a low-potential and electrocatalytic activation of water is necessary to achieve carbon dioxide oxidation. (6) (OH2)ads → (OH)ads + H+ + e− (7) (OH)ads → (O)ads + H+ + e− (8) (CO)ads + (O)ads → CO2 It is necessary to unravel the correlation between the geometric and electronic structures and the activity, which helps to promote preparation of high-performance electro catalysts. Also, by reason of their low tendency to cleave C–C bonds, the Pd based electro catalysts are capable to exhibit catalytic performance merely in alkaline media, where they are also far more selective. Recently, in situ FTIR spectroelectrochemistry has investigated the chemo selectivity of ethanol electro oxidation on Pd using a smooth Pd electrode at various pH values. Bambagioni et al. [48], researched the oxidation of ethylene glycol in alkaline media through in-situ FTIR spectroscopy on a Pd electrode. The electrocatalytic oxidation of ethylene glycol on the Pd electrode was shown to be significantly influenced by the pH. Specifically, carbonate was detected at pH below 12. It was shown that the Pd exhibited high electro catalytic behavior against ethylene glycol oxidation usually through the following mechanism in alkaline media with low starting potential and high current densities: The Pd based electrodes for the electrocatalytic oxidation of ethylene glycol in alkaline media have been investigated in detail. In this study, cyclicvoltammetric (CV) measurements in different electrolytes were performed to assess the effect of pH on the performance of the Pd electrode. During positive cycle, anodic peak currents tend to increase when the pH is raised, that led to a negative shift of 0.09 V in the peak potential. Under high alkaline pH reaction medium, 27-times higher peak current density has been detected that validate role of hydroxyl ions. During backward scan, a positive shift of 0.03 V in the peak potential and a 16-times more peak current density were obtained, that are analogous to theoretical studies. The electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol at low working temperature (20 °C) on several Pt-based catalysts and their catalytic activities are assessed [49]. Interestingly, the electrocatalytic oxidation of several alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol, on Pt and Pd surface has been comparatively evaluated [50]. It is deduced that the reactive intermediate formed and adsorbed over catalyst surface greatly determine the efficiency of catalyst. Alternately, relative efficiency of the Pt and Pd catalyst towards methanol and ethanol in acidic and basic aqueous solutions in different structural patterned catalysts surface has also been studied [51]. The authors claimed that both nanoporous Pt and Pd displayed higher electro catalytic activity along with good stability when paralleled to planar metal planes and efficiency was found for be maximum with basic solution. In comparison, Pd showed high activity towards ethylene glycol oxidation in strong alkaline solutions, and either suggested a mechanism for electro catalytic oxidation of ethylene glycol on the Pd surface. Due to the fact that Pd is not susceptible to breaking the C–C bond in ethylene glycol, the use of Pd for ethylene glycol oxidation improves the production of oxalates, soothes CO poisoning of electrodes and thus improves the electro catalytic stability. Additionally, glycol ate may be further oxidized to oxalate and carbonate at potentials greater than 0.9 V. Zhao et al. [52] investigated the electro catalytic oxidation of Ethylene glycol on the polycrystalline Pd electrode in alkaline media through in-situ FTIR reflection spectroscopy and examined the effect of the concentration of ethylene glycol on the reaction pathways. Analytical studies by the authors revealed that reaction mechanism and product formation highly relies upon ethylene glycol concentration. Depending upon the reaction conditions, the product formed may differ such as carbonate ion, oxalate ion and glyoxylic to glycolate. While glycol concentration is low, the bridged carbon monoxide species get oxidized easily, which is confirmed by in-situ FTIR studies. Fig. 4 displays the mechanistic steps involved in electrochemical oxidation of Ethylene glycol into carbonate and oxalate. In recent times, in-situ FTIR spectroelectrochemistry investigated the chemoselectivity of ethanol electro oxidation on Pd using a smooth Pd electrode at different pH values [53]. Prior to the spectroelectrochemical analysis, CV investigated the effect of pH on ethanol electro oxidation on 1.0 M ethanol solution with different concentrations of NaOH but similar ionic strength. As inferred from these studies, the pH of electrolyte greatly influenced kinetics of electrochemical oxidation reaction. A peak current density was observed at pH 14, while the activity decreased below or above 1.0 M for concentrations of NaOH. The behavior was already extremely weak at pH 12. A similar pattern has also been observed for nanostructured Pd-based electro catalysts. In order to promote the oxidation reaction on Pd, elevated concentration of hydroxyl ions is necessary. However, when hydroxyl ion concentration is more than optimal level, the catalytic performance is lower. In-situ FTIR spectral studies conducted under varied pH conditions with 1.0 M ethanol to acquire information about reaction pathway under possible phase polarization. The characteristic bands of the acetate ion (1558 cm−1 and 1415 cm−1) were clearly observed in 0.5 M NaOH media, with no sign of either CO2 or carbonate. Taken as a whole, these findings indicate that the oxidative C–C bond cleavage of ethanol on Pd occurs only at concentrations of NaOH lower than 0.5 M and also suggest that the oxidation of ethanol to carbon dioxide on Pd in moderate alkaline media occurs either without COad intermediation (collapse of the oxidized molecule directly into CO2) or by the rapid oxidation of weakly adsorbed CO by the abundant oxygen. The mechanism of ethanol oxidation has been investigated in detail with the use of CV studies [53]. From these results it in deduced that elimination of the adsorbed acyl by the adsorbed hydroxyl group is the rate-controlling step regardless of the information that dissociative adsorption of ethanol proceeds fast. It was inferred from earlier studies that the main products slowly ranged from carbonate, oxalate, and glyoxylate to glycol with the concentration of ethylene glycol. From, potential cycling studies it has been inferred that the rate determining step is the removal of the adsorbed species, while the dissociative adsorption of ethanol is occurring before this step. Furthermore, the competing adsorption among ethylene glycol/intermediates and water prevented the formation of oxygen species from water dissociation, which was considered a crucial oxygen donor for deep ethylene glycol oxidation."
4,The underlying synergy of the core-shell nanostructures for electrocatalysis,"2.2 The underlying synergy of the core-shell nanostructures for electrocatalysis The catalytic and electrocatalytic activity of the core-shell nanocatalyst be determined by on its synergistic interactions amid the core and shell. Both experimental and theoretical studies are dedicated to shed light on the primary mechanism behind synergy effect that operates between core and shell nanostructures [54–56]. Density functional theory (DFT), a powerful means for scheming surface energetics that deals with degree of interaction of reactants and products with electrocatalytic surface also predicts how favorably molecules dissociate and associate on surface [57]. More efficient approaches for creating catalysts have been recognized by linking the gap between DFT calculations for designing catalysts and synthesis techniques for realizing the desired structures. As a result, the design of catalysts has risen in popularity, and recent reports have emphasized how important it is [58–60]. Predominantly there are three major effects (and in most cases a combined one) that can play significant roles in determining the activity of an electrocatalyst: (i) ligand effect (ii) ensemble effect (iii) geometric effect [61]. It is documented that task-specific the core-shell nanomaterials with multifunctional activities are resulting primarily due to these effects that play a detrimental role to enhance the synergism. Thus, highly useful tailorable properties of the core-shell originates from favorable interaction among the components governed by aforementioned factors. Ligand effect arise due to interaction between the core and the shell caused by atomic proximity influencing charge transfer between the components, thereby fluctuating the band-structures. Presence of surface adsorbed atoms over material is the prime cause of ensemble effects. While, geometric effect instigates from variation in reactivity of the surface atoms due to their three-dimensional organizational constraints. Significant interactions between core and shell components serve as a model. It is possible to change the electronic/chemical configurations of active sites, which is very essential. It is critical to increase the intrinsic behavior by optimizing the bindings of reaction intermediates. The lattice strain of shells and interfacial electronic redistribution in core-shell nanostructures is capable of shifting the D-band centers too accordingly [62,63]. The interactions that exist in the core-shell nanostructures, in specific, that are favorable for enhanced electrocatalysis are either strain effects caused by the structure or electron transfer between two components. It operates when the morphology of shell component is compressed or expanded as a result of lattice mismatch with core lattices. The tensile strain, in general, decreases the coordination numbers of surface atoms, resulting in decreased bandwidth and an upshifting of the D-band center. The compressive lattice strain has the reverse effect, broadening the bands and moving the D-band core down. Through coating noble metal catalyst as a monolayer on the surfaces of non-precious metallic cores is beneficial to develop economical and cost-efficient alternate electrocatalysts. In addition, a highly conductive component, whether as the core or the shell, can accelerate electron transport and promote activity in electrocatalytic processes. Son et al., successfully employed this technique with Ni@Pd core-shell nanoparticle-based catalysts that demonstrated strong catalytic activity towards Sonogashira coupling reactions [64]. In addition to reducing the amount of costly material used in the catalytic device by only using Pt as a shell monolayer over Co and Fe surfaces, the composite materials can contribute to improved oxygen adsorption energy, and thus enhanced catalytic behavior and durability. Recently, bimetallic Ru@Pt and Ru–Pt alloy models with similar electron-transfer effect but different surface geometries to discover the mechanism behind their enhanced behavior in alkaline medium towards hydrogen evolution reaction has also been studied [65]. Ru@Pt alloy with a highly compressive stressed surface demonstrated significantly enhanced activity than the strain-free RuPt alloy, indicating a stronger interaction with reaction intermediates. From these studies, it is evidently proved that fundamental design and applications of the core-shell electrocatalysts can be explained with help of DFT that principally deals with D-band shift. Also, a systematic study is conducted using highly active Ru@Pt core-shell electrocatalyst with enhanced ECSA for oxygen reduction reaction, DFT calculations predicted that two predominate effects are possible reasons for tuning binding energies of oxygen reaction intermediates on a catalyst surface. Two factors (i) weakening oxygen binding energies through formation of thin-film over layers (ii) nanoscale effects supporting oxygen binding energies are causing enhancement of observed activities. Bonding properties may be improved to increase the catalytic activity of the core-shell mechanism by designing a core-shell nanoparticle morphology with the necessary dimensions, that is, the thickness of the over layer and the size of the nanoparticle [66]. In contrast, strong anti-synergy effects between Au and Pd are reported for bimetallic Au–Pd catalyst towards mechanistically closely-related CO oxidation, water gas reaction and formic acid decomposition, however benzyl alcohol oxidation is favored with operating synergism [67]. This study revealed that under low-temperature gas-phase conditions, the electronic interaction between Pd and Au, which is used to elucidate the synergy perceived for selective oxidation reactions, but it clearly does not play a significant role in CO oxidation, water gas reaction and formic acid decomposition. Beck et al., used a TiO2-supported AuPd catalyst with a variety of preparation methods to produce various nanostructured bimetallic catalysts that are made up of two metals [68]. Notwithstanding the of the preparation process, no substantial synergy was found in such catalysts, suggesting that the existence of the core-shell structures has no effect on the catalytic activity for CO oxidation. This influence may be explained by a number of factors, one of which is the Au and Pd alloy segregation in AuPd alloys. AuPd alloy catalysts should be active for CO oxidation, according to a range of theoretical and model catalyst studies. Ham et al., used DFT to explain AuPd interactions with CO and O2 on AuPd (111) surfaces. According to their predictions, “partially-poisoned” Pd ensembles would aid O2 activation and subsequent reaction [69]. A recent review on the development of nanocatalyst and DFT Calculations for direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide by Han et al., revealed a method of combining DFT calculations and synthetic technologies for development of high-performance the core-shell nanocatalysts, offers guiding principle on competent approaches for designing cutting edge catalysts [70]. Recently, Zhou et al., spotlighted the importance of metal-support interaction of the Pd–O–Ce linkage towards electro-oxidation of formic acid, this study revealed that there is 1.93-fold higher mass activity is achievable through tuning Pd–O–Ce bonds present in Pd@CeO2 catalyst [71]. In this investigation, CeO2-rods, CeO2-plates, and CeO2-cubes were synthesized via a facile method by firmly directing the reactants, temperature, and reaction time, TEM analysis is performed to confirm it. Electrochemical cycling studies has been performed with different structured CeO2 catalysts for formic acid oxidation (in acidic medium) revealed that mass activity follows an order Pd@CeO2-plates (760.4 mA mgPd) > Pd@CeO2-cubes (134.7 mA mgPd) > Pd@CeO2-rods (334.2 mA mgPd). This difference is addressed as morphology coupling effect, mainly caused by presence of Pd–O–Ce linkages. Different shaped CeO2 nanorods, cubes, and plates were also investigated to explore shape effect, number of Ce3+ ions and Pd–O–Ce bonds play an influential role towards determining CO tolerance ability and catalytic efficiency. Thermal annealing in H2 or air was also used by authors to investigate the importance of the Pd–O–Ce linkage, and only true Pd–O–Ce linkages can be created in the inert atmosphere. This was due to the ease of which oxygen atoms could be removed from the CeO2 lattice annealed in N2, and the latest generation oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen would capture the mobile Pd nanocrystals by creating reinforced Pd–O–Ce linkages. This Pd–O–Ce was transformed to a high valence state of Pd4+ and metallic Pd into the CeO2 lattice during the electrochemical oxidation/reduction cycling, ensuring formic acid oxidation based on the well-known bifunctional process. Likewise, PdNi alloy supported on N-doped graphene aerogel with improved anti-CO poisoning ability has also evidenced synergic effect induced catalytic performance with enhanced mass activity [72]. Similarly, it is well-proved by experimental results that synergic properties due to strong electronic effect of PtCo/N-doped carbon catalyst displayed better anti-CO poisoning resistance towards electrochemical oxidation of ethanol [73]. When the PtCo-NC catalyst was compared to the Pt/C catalyst for alcohol oxidation, it was discovered that the synergistic effect between the in situ developed PtCo nanoparticle and the N-doped carbon help could maximize the resistance of CO-like intermediates and facilitate the electrochemical efficiency for alcohol fuel oxidation. Pt-based core-shell nanoparticles as highly active electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cell systems has been successfully reviewed by Oezaslan et al., which concluded that surface and subsurface structure of multimetallic core-shell nanoparticles profoundly influence the reactivity of the catalysts [74]. In recent times, thermal annealing combined with synergic effects resulted in better-performing Pd@FeP catalyst with maximum efficiency for formic acid oxidation is also demonstrated [75]. Its durability is quite stable when 1000 cycles performed. It is noticed from recent studies that the annealed Pd/FeP catalysts had 1.6 times the catalytic activity of unannealed Pd/FeP catalysts and 2.8 times the catalytic activity of Pd/C catalysts. A recent investigation on Pt nanoparticles modified with selenium spherical nanostructures also highlighted the significance of electronic interaction among the components towards fine-tuning catalyst activity [76]."
5,Approaches for synthesis of PCA:-,"Diverse methods including with bottom-up and top-down approaches have been developed, optimized and are principally achieved by means of physical, chemical, or biosynthetic means or combination thereof in order to fabricate PCA. Being, inspired by unusual compositions and customized properties, innovative processing methods have been created to make these unique PCAs. In bottom-up approach, which is often preferred one, self-assembly of atoms lead to construction of nanosize particles, whereas in the top-down approach, bulk material is broken down into nanosize particle but this strategy has not been applied for core-shell synthesis. These well-organized nanocomponents are made of more than one different metals therefore are synthesized through various methods and techniques. The comprehensive information about the nature of core-shell material and methods evolved to synthesis PCA nanostructures is provided in Fig. 5 . A wide range of organic and inorganic nanomaterials can be used to construct both the center and the exterior of the nanostructure core layers. A combination of several different materials, where the building components are easily distinguishable from each other, is referred to as composite or nanocomposite when the dimensions are less than 100 nm. The functional properties of nanocomposites differ from their components, do not necessarily match with them. Maintaining a smooth, lock-hole free shell capable of covering a well-defined core is one foremost complexity while synthesizing core-shell particle. There are also examples of where the final form differs significantly from this standard. Upon addition of the outer shell material to the center by a second-step reduction of metal ions, small metal particles may originate on the core surface and stay as decorative spheres. Shortly, the core-shell component may function as both an adhesive without which it may not hold together, and the corresponding blend of components will not exhibit any existing properties of the PCA [77], hence it is carefully fabricated. The synthetic route is accomplished because the heterogeneous nucleation of the nanoparticle seed (second metal) or core has a lower critical energy limit, i.e., the total excess free energy, than the homogeneous nucleation. Colloidal synthesis, electrochemical methods and chemical-reaction-driven reconstructions are technologically advanced techniques for producing the heterogeneous-structures of bi-metallic or multimetallic core–shell nanoparticles. Depending on the total excess energy, this is primarily related to surface and interfacial energy terms and the strain energy due to lattice mismatch. There is a broad variety of techniques used to manufacture core-shell nanoparticles, depending on surface enrichment, precipitation, decomposition, leaching or deposition to create the core-shell particles [78]. In addition to the core-shell particles prepared by the sequential deposition method and the microemulsion method, hollow particles were also synthesized. These hollow materials consist of either mixed core or shell material or only shell material. Following section provide an overview about the methods, in deep discuss about the electrocatalytic activity of synthesized core-shell structures for alcohol/formic acid oxidation. We have identified the active characteristics of the techniques currently being considered for PCA characterization and their electrocatalytic evaluation against alcohol oxidation reaction. In this report, the suitability of specific characterization techniques will be evaluated and validated to ascertain the nature of core-shell catalyst and their appropriateness as an electrocatalyst towards alcohol oxidation. In doing so, we took the liberty of referencing only those works as deemed applicable to highlight a specific point, rather than a thorough analysis of all the studies conducted in the area. The experimental technique for PCA synthesis is defined as well along with a brief description about size and electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of synthesized material that has a profound influence upon electrocatalytic activity."
6,Electrodeposition and galvanic displacement methods,"3.1 Electrodeposition and galvanic displacement methods Pd surrounded Pt shell is fabricated with enhanced catalytic efficiency and improved utility of active components that possess high surface-to-volume ratio, with the goal of developing cost-effective electrocatalyst for direct methanol fuel cells. Highly ordered Pd/Pt core–shell nanowire arrays (Pd/Pt NWAs) have been prepared using anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) as a template by Wang et al., [79]. The electrodeposition and magnetron sputtering techniques has been followed herein to fabricate PCA. The as-formed Pd/Pt NWA electrode shows a very high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and high electrocatalytic activity towards methanol electrooxidation in acid medium, hence suitable for DMFC catalysis. Herein, the pre-formed Pd nanowires acted as seeds for Pt deposition, leading to substantial promotion effect for electro catalytic oxidation of methanol. Besides, it is determined that strongly ordered nanowire arrangement is also useful for the diffusion of liquid alcohol and reaction products to and from the electrocatalyst that exhibited high mass specific anodic peak current density is 756.7 mA mg −1 Pt. The observed results are higher by a factor of four as compared to conventional E-TEK PtRu/C electro catalysts. This report focuses on the mechanism of the significant enhancement of the Pd/Pt core/shell nanostructure in towards efficiency and electrocatalytic activity of Pt for the methanol electro-oxidation when reaction is carried out in acid medium. The electronic interaction between Pt shell and underlying Pd, contributes to remove adsorbed CO intermediate easily, which resulted in enhanced methanol electro-oxidation as reported by this study. Localized overgrowth of binary Pt/Pd nanoparticles were attributed due to space-confined growth of Pd on cubic Pt seeds. The as-formed catalysts is investigated for electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid also. Followed by it, hollow Au–Pd core shell nanoparticles are synthesized using Ag nanoparticles as seeds and consequent galvanic displacement [80]. Synthetic steps involve initial mixing of Ag nanoparticles dissolved in surfactant with HAuCl4 under ultrasonication in surfactant medium for 1 min, followed by addition of palladium chloride salt. The hollow Au@Pd core-shell particles are achieved through addition of ascorbic acid reducing agent and maintained heating conditions for 75o C for 1 h. The average diameter of hollow Au@Pd core-shell particle is 5.1 nm, average Pd shell thickness of 17 nm. Fig. S1 illustrates TEM, STEM and HRTEM images of Au@Pd hollow core-shell nanostructure prepared by galvanic displacement with Ag nanoparticles. It is worth mentioning that Au@Pd hollow core-shell nanostructure exhibits superior crystallinity as compared to its non-hollow counterpart that is prepared by the similar method. EDS measurements showed atomic ratio of Au@Pd structure is 1:3.44, wherein hollow core is created by Au and Pd is grown outside in hetroepiatxy manner. XRD pattern showed that the shell thickness of Pd in hollow Au@Pd hollow nanostructure is 16.8 nm, which was determined from the Scherer equation. Hollow Au@Pd core–shell nanoparticles with higher crystallinity displayed highest current density for the ethanol oxidation reaction in alkaline medium as illustrated by CV studies. Enhancement effect is being evinced by core-shell morphology through modifying electronic and morphological characteristics. As-synthesized hollow Au@Pd core-shell nanostructure demonstrated superior redox activity and contribution of Au core also influence electrocatalytic property. The improved catalytic activity with increasing size Au@Pd hollow core-shell nanostructure clearly proves alloying nanomaterial effect upon electroactivity. It has been claimed that the core-shell morphology promotes catalytic performance by modulating electronic level and geometric properties. It is inferred from this study that carbonaceous intermediates formed as a by-product gets removed easily when hollow structured Au@Pd core–shell is employed as an electrocatalyst but removal of adsorbed intermediates is difficult over non-hollow Au@Pd core–shell surface. However, the current associated with ethanol oxidation doesn't vary much for hollow and non-hollow catalysts. The as-prepared hollow Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles show the highest current density for the ethanol oxidation reactions in alkaline medium due to its structural characteristics. Further, taking advantage of the potential difference existing between core and shell materials, oxidation of core metal and subsequent removal of it is carried out, which is well-documented in literature [81]. Likewise, carbon-supported Cu core Pt@Pd shell (Cu@Pt–Pd) catalysts have been successfully synthesized through the galvanic replacement of Cu atoms by metal ions and their electrocatalytic activity in acidic medium towards methanol and ethanol oxidation have been examined [82]. The narrow-size distributed Cu@Pt–Pd core-shell nanoparticles of an average diameter in the range of 3.1–3.5 nm were produced onto the carbon support. The compositional and functional evaluation of the as-prepared materials indicated that the nanoparticles are formed by a Cu rich core are protected by a Pt–Pd rich shell. This particular structure is resulted due to the inter-diffusion of the metals after the galvanic replacement reaction. Chloride salts of platinum and palladium are added into carbon supported copper dissolved in the sodium citrate/citric acid buffer solution, the core-shell structure is produced through galvanic displacement reaction. XRD pattern of catalyst revealed the presence of three distinct peaks arising due to (111), (200) and (220) diffractions of Pt and Pd face-centered cubic structures [83]. Six different catalysts with varied elemental composition are prepared in this investigation and it is determined that catalyst composition of Pt0.59Pd0.324Cu0.167/C performs better than the other catalysts under study. The authors have evaluated performance of prepared electrocatalyst through measuring catalytic poisoning rate and turnover number. Poisoning rate of catalyst was determined from chronoamperometric study using the equation as follows: (9) P o i s o n i n g R a t e = 100 i 0 × ( d i | d t ) t > 500 s e c ( % p e r sec ) where Io is the current at the start of polarization back extrapolated from the linear current decay (A) and (dI/dt)>500 denotes the slope of the linear portion of the current decay (A s−1). The catalytic activity of a heterogeneous catalyst is generally defined by turnover frequency or turnover number that evaluates active number of the catalytic centers accessible for reaction. This is a measure of number of molecules reacted or converted into product per active surface site in a second under a particular potential and experimental conditions. The following equation provides a formula to calculate turnover number [84]: (10) T O N = ( m o l e c u l e s | s i t e s ) = j N A n F 1.3 × 10 15 Where, NA denotes Avogadro number, n represents number of electrons generated by alcohol oxidation per molecule, j indicates steady-state current density, F is the Faraday constant. The TEM studies on the as-prepared catalyst disclosed the presence of a large amount of evenly distributed nearly spherical nanoparticles with size in the range of 2.9 nm–3.6 nm. It may be noted from cyclic voltammogram that the methanol oxidation commences at 0.19 V for Cu core Pt@Pd shell catalyst comprising optimized composition. When quantity of Pt and Pd is increased in catalysts composition, the onset potential also tends to increase, which goes up to 0.25 V. The presence of Pd and Cu atoms on the Pt-based core-shell material causes a change in the electronic structure of Pt atoms through modifying electronic density of state at the Fermi level. This modification helps to weaken the metal-adsorbate bond strength and mitigates the catalytic poisoning. Similar behavior is noticed for ethanol oxidation also, however ethanol oxidation began at more positive potential as compared to that of methanol oxidation reaction. Analytical studies prove that copper-enriched core is being formed, due to interdiffsional metals. ECSA (135.8 m2/g), composition and thickness of Pt@Pd shell as well as lattice parameters exert profound influence over catalytic activity. Based on the outcomes, the optimized catalyst composition is determined, that comprised 6.2 wt % Pt, 2.2 wt % Pd and 0.7 wt % Cu from the studies on the basis of alcohol oxidation kinetics. Accordingly, the optimized Cu core Pt@Pd shell catalyst exhibited low onset voltage, higher poison-tolerance along with higher turnover number as compared to conventional PtRu/C catalyst. It has been verified by the electrochemical experimental results. It may be noted that PdCu bimetallic electrocatalyst surrounded by copper core-shell nanoparticles are synthesized through galvanic displacement method [85]. A pre-determined quantity of copper sulfate dissolved in ethylene glycol is reduced by addition of sodium borohydride followed by addition of palladium salt to displace through oxidation of copper. Catalytic activity of an electrocatalyst is evaluated using CV and parameters derived from this study provide significant information about efficiency and extent of fouling of catalysts surface [86]. CV continues to be an important electrochemical screening technique for alcohol oxidation catalysts. CV is unique in its ability to provide some critical yet essential information on the energetics (thermodynamics) and kinetics of the electro-oxidation reaction. The electrocatalytic parameters are set in terms of the onset alcohol oxidation potential (Eon), separation between anodic and cathodic peaks (ΔEp) peak current (If and Ib) and peak potential (Ep) [87]. Lower onset potential is suggestive of facile reaction, less peak separation designates easy elimination of collected reactive intermediate species, higher peak current during forward sweep designates better performing catalyst while, degree of poison tolerance is indicated by If/Ib ratio. These studies also aid to explore the catalyst's ability to avoid fouling from intermediate oxidation products [88]. CV studies demonstrated higher oxidation peak current towards ethanol oxidation on Cu@PdCu/C catalyst surface (166 mAcm−2). Ratio of forward anodic peak current (If) to backward anodic peak current (Ib), [If/Ib] is the measure of catalytic sensitivity, that is an indirect measure of ability of catalysts to withstand surface poisoning. The synergy that exists between Pd and Cu core-shell structures promote geometric effect, electronic effect and bifunctional mechanism, as well helps improved electrocatalytic response as well higher ratio of forward to backward current ratio [If/Ib]. Additionally, the [If/Ib] is determined as 1.36, that infers that prepared catalyst possess good tolerance towards catalyst-poisoning intermediates that tend to adsorb over the surface and results in performance degradation. The authors have also examined durability of electrochemical response to ethanol oxidation by keeping electrode potential at 0.3 V for 1800s by the chronoammperometry. After an initial quick drop in performance, the activity were stabilized at 10.8 mA cm−2 on Cu@PdCu/C, catalyst shows high oxidation current that proves that best catalytic durability for ethanol oxidation is exhibited. As-prepared catalyst exhibit nearly 3fold higher activities towards ethanol oxidation in alkaline media when compared to commercial Pd/C catalyst owing to synergistic effect operating between palladium and copper metallic components. From the results it is evident that Cu@PdCu/C catalyst with the core-shell structure has enhanced Pd utilization, improved specific surface area and ultimately resulted in better mass activity through offering more number of active catalytic centers for ethanol molecules to react. The cyclic voltammograms of the as-prepared catalysts the as-prepared catalysts in 1 M KOH is provided in Fig.S2. It is clear from the investigation that the Cu@PdCu/C catalyst has the lowest polarization potential in alkaline medium with the fastest polarization time at 520 s. In addition, Cu@PdC/C has a lower onset potential and lower value for CO oxidation relative to PdCu/C and Pd/C catalysts, showing a high tolerance to CO poisoning. The peak current of ethanol oxidation core-shell catalyst is as high as 166.0 mA cm2. In addition, its durability along with antifouling properties is highly desirable. Impressively, a single-stage electrodeposition method for the preparation of Au@Pd core–shell nanoparticles using deep eutectic solvent as an electrolytic medium is reported by Anu et al. [89], the use of prepared catalyst for methanol electro-oxidation in alkaline media is successfully demonstrated as well. This process of electrodeposition confirms a better adhesion of Au@Pd core–shell nanoparticles over substrate. Stimulatingly, this ready-to-use electrocatalyst is fabricated through the simultaneous electrodeposition over graphite surface by an anodic dissolution technique. Unlike the conventional two-stage preparation process, this method avoid use of additional stabilizing agents, reducing agents and metal salt precursors. The as-synthesized electrocatalyst exhibit excellent catalytic efficiency along with good CO tolerance. Ethaline, a deep eutectic solvent composed of ethylene glycol and choline chloride is used as medium for deposition, wherein former acts both as reducing agent and stabilizer. The adequate ionic strength and low surface-tension are fascinating properties of deep eutectic medium that helps to construct nanoparticles with faster nucleation rate. Electrodeposition is carried out in deep eutectic solvent (Ethaline) using two electrode set up, wherein Au and Pd metal wires are employed together as an anode and graphite rod acted as a cathode. Anodic dissolution of metals as well as their instantaneous electrodeposition of bimetallic Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles was carried out at a constant current density in ethaline medium for duration of 40 min. Fig. 6 shows schematics of experimental setup used in this study. The authors explained the mechanism of electrochemical formation of Au@Pd nanoparticles on the surface of graphite based upon difference in dissolution rate of Pd and Au ions in deep eutectic solvent. Pd wire dissolved readily in relation to Au, consequently electrodeposited catalyst comprised more Pd in its composition. The SEM images of the electrodeposited bimetallic nanoparticles exhibited merged metallic components of size more than 30 nm revealing core-shell morphology. Initial CV studies in 0.5 M sulphuric acid conducted with as-prepared Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles exhibited anodic oxidation peak due to hydrogen adsorption at 0.05 V, while the cathodic peak displayed a broadened peak formed by reduction of gold oxide. These outcomes confirmed formation of Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles. The occurrence of stripping peaks of both AuO and PdO in the voltammogram of Au@Pd endorses the bimetallic nature of the catalyst. Stripping peaks of Au becomes visible only after exclusion of Pd is an electrochemical confirmation for core-shell morphology. As-prepared Au@Pd electro catalyst is used to study electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol in 0.5 M sodium hydroxide, comparative CV analysis prove that Au@Pd core-shell catalyst performed better than their monometallic equivalents. The surface coverage of hydroxyl ions over catalyst surface profoundly influence electrocatalytic efficiency, in addition to this the synergic effect caused by Au@Pd core-shell nanostructure provides increased accessibility of electroactive sites for methanol molecules thereby promoting rate of electrocatalysis. Open circuit potential (OCV) and Eon for methanol oxidation associated with Au@Pd are 0.441 V and 0.45 V respectively. The authors predicted that facile electrocatalytic properties of Au@Pd core-shell catalyst are indicated by the minimal difference between the aforementioned potentials. This value is higher for the corresponding monometallic counterparts. Upon continuous cycling, electrochemical response is little affected after 100 cycles with prepared Au@Pd core-shell catalyst suggesting good poison tolerance ability. Upon extending the positive cycling potential, reverse peak of methanol oxidation gets suppressed. The authors studied kinetics of methanol oxidation in detail by carrying out Tafel analysis, activation energy measurements as well as reaction order calculations. Fig.S3 represents Tafel analysis plots and Arrhenius plots for methanol oxidation reaction in alkaline media. Au@Pd nanoparticles displayed Tafel slope in the range of 122–135 mV dec−1 in the temperature regime varied from 15 to 35o C, illustrating a single electron transfer reaction. Arrhenius activation energy is a measure of ease with which reaction occurs. Lower activation energy of 13–20 kJ moL−1 is required at a potential range of 0.31 V–0.16 V for Au@Pd catalyst. By average, the energy of activation is 16.2 kJ moL−1, which is lower than monometallic counterparts. The authors have claimed that the results proved synergistic catalytic effect of Au and Pd towards methanol oxidation. From log I vs. log C plot, reaction order has been determined as half and the mechanism involved is unaffected by the concentration of methanol. The activation energy requirements of the Au@Pd core-shell modified graphite electrodes were low, constructing them prospective anode catalysts in alkaline methanol fuel cells at ambient temperatures. The reported method of synthesis is facile, efficient and a green approach."
7,Chemical deposition,"3.2 Chemical deposition Probably interest on core-shell structured Pd catalyst aroused when it is proved that the catalytic activity of Pd catalyst supported on core-shell microgels is higher than that of spherical polyelectrolyte brush [90]. This report proved that core-shelled morphology of catalyst support is advantageous to modify the catalytic properties positively. Although it is not utilized for any alcohol oxidation studies, catalytic activity of the Pd nanoparticles was by following the reduction of p-nitrophenol by sodium borohydride. This report arrived with significant conclusions that Pd catalytic activity is highly dependent upon the type of reducing agent used difference in catalytic activity between Pd and core-shelled Pd originated from limited diffusion. The catalyst prepared here is used for oxidation of p-nitro phenol, however not examined for electro-oxidation of simple aliphatic alcohols. The multimetallic catalysts were studied extensively with a view towards improving catalyst efficiency. Correlation between catalytic or electronic behavior is established with the nature of core or shell material. Apparently, inverted core-shell Pd/Pt core-shell catalyst has been synthesized through sacrificial hydrogen to control the morphology [91]. These core-shell catalysts are protected by polyvinyl pyrolidine. Similar strategy is applied to prepare (inverted core/shell) Pd-core@Au-shell structured bimetallic nanoclusters, wherein colloidal dispersion of Pd core is reacted with hydrogen subsequently gold ions is introduced slowly into the reaction medium to get inverted core-shell nanoparticles. The as-prepared core-shell particles are believed to possess superior catalytic activity due to existence of electronic effect of adjacent metallic component. In this method, colloidal dispersion was prepared by covering Pd-core nanoclusters with Pt atoms consequently generated by sacrificial hydrogen adsorbed on Pd nanoclusters. The proposed methodologies are based on capability of noble metals to split hydrogen through oxidation and stronger tendency of the adsorbed hydrogen to get reduced that occurs at a low redox potential. The FTIR spectra of Pd@Pt core-shell catalysts elucidated that individual components are present in the core-shell catalysts. In the as-prepared catalyst Pt shell surrounds Pd core structure partly and it is used to investigate methyl acrylate hydrogenation reaction. A facile approach to prepare organic-solvent-dispersible Pd@CeO2 core-shell nanostructure has been explored through developing self-assembly between functionalized Pd nanoparticles and cerium (IV) alkoxides [92]. In this approach, initially Pd nanoparticles surrounded by a monolayer of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid is prepared that is functionalized with carboxylic acid groups. These carboxylic acid functionalities are used to build self-assembly of cerium (IV) alkoxide around the metal particles, which are hydrolyzed to produce CeO2. The method developed herein is quite flexible as well permits alteration in the dimensions of Pd core. The width of CeO2 layer and dispersing properties of resulting nanostructure could also be fine-tuned. The as-prepared catalyst is proposed for alcohol oxidation. Alternately, Pd core-shell structure surrounded by hollow porous carbon-shell is fabricated through conventional impregnation technique followed by heating at high temperature [93].The as-formed catalyst is evaluated as a highly promising material for alcohol oxidation of in the liquid phase. The Pd@hmC sample exhibited 48% conversion of benzyl alcohol to yield 37% of benzaldehyde when reaction carried out for 1 h. The structural characteristics are useful for effective utilization of Pd sites that resulted in high turn-over frequency that is attributable due to the presence of a well-developed porous network in the lateral carbon shells that allows effective diffusion of both the substrate and the products. It is also noteworthy that the as-prepared catalyst demonstrated superior catalytic activity for primary benzylic and allylic alcohols mainly due to its specific design. Investigating the mechanistic aspects for alcohol oxidation revealed that the catalytic oxidation over the Pd@hmC sample proceeds essentially by the same reaction path as that on conventional Pd-supported carbon such as Pd/AC. Hence, the primary cause of high catalytic activity of Pd@hmC is its specific structure, i.e., pristine Pd nanoparticles encapsulated in a carbon-shell with well-developed pore systems, leading to efficient utilization of surface sites of Pd nanoparticles compared to that in the case of other supported Pd catalyst. It is to be highlighted that a simple one-step wet chemical method is employed to prepare Pd@Pt core-shell dentric nanocrystal supported over reduced graphene oxide employing ascorbic acid as a reducing agent [94]. Herein, polyethylene oxide played both as a structure directing material as well as stabilizing agent. The diameter particles dispersed on reduced graphene-oxide is determined to be in the range of 27–47 nm as illustrated by TEM images. It is proposed that the dentric structure are formed due to presence polyethylene oxide which is responsible for enhancing specific surface area through increasing number of active reaction sites and corner atoms for electrocatalysis. When the concentration of polyethylene oxide is increased beyond optimal limit, homogenous dispersion of Pd–Pt is favored that signifies role of stabilizing agent. The pre-formed small Pd nuclei provide active sites for Pt deposition and anisotropic growth in presence of stabilizing agent leads to core-shell dendritic structure. ECSA measured through CO stripping is determined to be 114.15 m2 g−1 for reduced graphene oxide dispersed Pd–Pt core-shell dendritic nanostructures that is higher than individual metal components. Both electrochemical ethanol and methanol oxidation reactions are studied in alkaline medium using this material as a catalyst. The performed electrochemical studies demonstrated that there is a down shift in Eon for alcohol oxidation, which is associated with higher peak current density indicating higher catalytic activity. Higher mass activity of 1210 mAmg−1 and 1128.5 mAmg−1 for methanol and ethanol respectively is demonstrated. Noticeable catalytic activity is mainly attributed due to existence of synergy between Pd core and Pt shell and presence dendritic rich edged Pt surface. The presence of reduced graphene oxide as a metal support is beneficial to hinder aggregation and Ostawld ripening. Interestingly, star shaped Pd@Pt core–shell catalysts supported on reduced graphene oxide was synthesized without employing any surfactant is described by Kim et al. [95]. Generally, the surfactants are used for altering shape of metal nanostructures but are reported to cause degradation in electro catalytic activity. These star-like Pd@Pt core-shell/RGO catalyst displayed superior electrocatalytic action along with good electro catalytic stability for methanol oxidation reaction in alkaline solution. The size of these particles is determined to be in the range of 15–35 nm with an average diameter of 25 nm approximately as evidenced from TEM studies. The observed results indicate that pre-formed Pd clusters over reduced graphene oxide surface are able to create core-shell morphology, similar lattice parameters between Pt and Pd along with retarded reducing rate of amino acid together controls core-shell structure. Eventually, formation of core-shell morphology greatly depends upon variance in reduction rate of Pt and Pd salts. The bulk atomic ratio of the Pd: Pt is determined to be 66:34, with star shaped morphology. The surface Pd:Pt atomic ratio of the synthesized catalyst determined from the XPS spectra is 67:33, which is reliable with the bulk atomic ratio determined by ICP, TEM-EDX studies. ECSA of the catalyst measured from accumulated electric charge associated with hydrogen adsorption-desorption peaks from CV is determined to be 29.94 m2 g−1. The electrocatalytic performance towards methanol oxidation measured by conducting CV studies in 0.5 M sodium hydroxide comprising 0.5 M methanol produces higher current with normalized mass specific current of 4972 mA mg−1. Significantly higher electro catalytic response compared to commercial platinum catalyst is due to unique catalyst morphology providing more reaction sites to oxidize methanol. It shoubd be stated that the stability of electrocatalytic response is assessed by conducting chroammperometric studies for 1 h holding potential of working electrode at −0.25 V. Besides, the catalytic response has remained unchanged after this durability test with Pd@Pt/RGO catalyst but performance degradation is noticed with other catalysts such as PdPt/RGO (14%), Pt/RGO (27%), and Pt/C (35%). These results suggest Pd@Pt/RGO catalyst hold good potential to catalyze methanol oxidation. Alternately, an efficient route to derive porous Pt@Pd core-shell over reduced graphene oxide nanosheets under room temperature without employing any seed or organic solvent is achieved using octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol as a soft template [96]. Pt@Pd uniformly dispersed on the support, with the average diameter of 52.5 nm based on TEM analysis. ECSA of prepared catalysts is found to be 681 cm2mg−1, which is almost 16 times superior to that of commercial Pd catalyst. The electro catalytic response of the prepared catalysts in 1 M sodium hydroxide/1 M methanol evaluated through CV demonstrate increased CO tolerance of the material as that of [If/Ib] is 1.5. To further get insight, chroammperometry is performed with methanol as a model compound at an applied potential of −0.3 V. The porous Pt@Pd NSs/RGO modified electrode exhibited a decay in the polarization current for above 3000 s which then reached a steady state after 4000 s. In general, a chemisorbed species (COads) acts as a catalyst poison is accountable for initial drop in current, which is less pronounced for porous Pt@Pd NSs/RGO modified electrode in comparison with commercial Pd catalyst. These studies proved that the improved CO tolerance with enhanced electrocatalytic response of porous Pt@Pd NSs/RGO catalyst is attributed due to (i) homogenously distributed Pt@Pd over support (ii) larger ECSA (iii) optimal distance between Pd and Pt atoms (iv) better electrical conductivity of graphene support. Also, improved ethanol oxidation kinetics in alkaline media (0.1 M KOH) is reported for core/shell Ni@Pd nanoparticles deposited on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) as a catalyst, which is prepared through chemical vapor deposition method [97]. The synthetic steps involved in this approach are represented by Fig. 7 . A facile two-step approach impregnation-reduction technique followed by replacement method is demonstrated successfully to prepare Ni@Pd core shell particles with average particle size of 3.4 nm. The electrooxidation of methanol, ethanol and isopropanol were studied using as-synthesized catalyst. More than 2 fold improvement in the electrocatalytic response is shown over Ni@Pd particles in relation to pristine Pd particles, which is attributed mainly because of synergistic effect between Pd and Ni as well as higher mass activity due to improved utilization of catalytically active Ni@Pd zones. HRTEM analysis reveals that Ni@Pd core-shell particles exhibit crystalline structure with narrow distribution in diameter of 2–5 nm. Also XRD studies prove no peaks are associated with oxide of the metals indicating well-crystalline nature of Ni@Pd. Among the three alcohols studied, ethanol oxidation is proven to be highly active. The higher peak current density and low commencing oxidation potential for ethanol oxidation validated the observed results. The mass specific activity for ethanol oxidation is determined to be 3495 mA mg−1 of Pd whereas under similar conditions, Pd/MWNT displayed only 1539 mA mg−1. It has been claimed that both peak current density and mass-specific activity of synthesized Ni@Pd/MWNT catalyst is nearly two-fold higher than that associated with commercial catalysts. In comparison, Ni@Pd/MWCNTs catalyst has about 80 mV negative onset potential when compared to Pd/MWCNTs catalyst. Aforementioned results indicated that core and alloy structure of Ni@Pd electrocatlyst resulted in appreciably enhanced performance and efficiency. This is of the prime importance for the output of fuel cells. ECSA is 1.2 times higher for Ni@Pd/MWNT electro catalyst in relation to pure Pd/MWNT, which helps to promote higher utilization of active catalyst component owing to its unique core-shell morphology. The chronoammperometric studies prove that stable electrochemical response with good sustainability is achievable using Ni@Pd/MWNT electro catalyst. The observed improvement in the electrocatalytic activity is mainly attributed due to (i) intermetallic interaction between Pd and Ni that favors catalytic performance by ligand effect which could facilitate poisonous intermediates such as CO and hence regenerates active catalytic sites (ii) Low energy shift associated with d-band energy center of Pd due to presence of Ni is beneficial to deteriorate CO adsorption bond (iii) Core-shell structure significantly contributes improving the electrochemical activity by enhancing number of active catalytic zones. Therefore, this study proved core-shell structure is highly beneficial to increase utility ratio of noble metals. Noble metal on the outer layer and pure metal on the next atomic layer are of major importance rather than just noble metal as electro catalysts. A convenient method to synthesize Au–Pd core-shell particles is developed by Nath et al. [98], that involves co-reduction of Au(III) and Pd(II) precursors in organic solvent namely toluene instead of aqueous solvent in order to effectively prevent agglomeration. Such a core-shell processing technique aims to generate particles with a standardized form, composition and texture. The technique reported here is simple, reproducible and would be a specific approach for the direct synthesis of the various bimetallic organosol solutions alongside their monometallic structures. A different method is proposed to prepare well-dispersed Ni@Pd core-shell nanoparticles supported over MWNT is synthesized through simultaneous reduction of Ni2+ and PdCl4 2−, wherein sodium dodecyl sulfate is used as structure directing agent as well as capping material [99]. An enhanced eletrocatalytic activity towards methanol oxidation reaction over the prepared catalyst is successfully demonstrated in alkaline media. Unlike other techniques here, sodium dodecyl sulfate, an anionic surfactant is used to form self-assembly, sulphuric acid group with a negative charge attracts positively charged Nickel ions. Followed by this process of self-assembly, Pd ions are preferentially oriented and co-reduction of metal ions is carried out using sodium borohydride. The resulting Ni@Pd with core-shell structure and the diameter of the core-shell exhibited diameter in the range of 6–8 nm and its ECSA is determined to be 176.2 m2 g−1. The peak current associated with methanol oxidation over the Ni@Pd/Multiwalled carbon nanotube presented 770.7 mA/mg which is higher than PdNi/Multiwalled carbon nanotube by nearly 60%. [If/Ib] is determined as 1.99 for Ni@Pd/Multiwalled carbon nanotube towards methanol oxidation, which demonstrates improved CO tolerance to incompletely oxidized species accumulated on the surface of the electrode. Potential cycling and electrochemical endurance test studies for the catalyst Ni@Pd/Multiwalled carbon nanotube has the high current density and stability when chroammeprometry is carried out. Similarly, an easy method for steep-yield synthesis of Au–Pd core-shell heterostructures with peculiar tetra hexahedral configuration using Au nanocubes as systemic-directing cores employing ascorbic acid as a reducing agent has been reported much earlier [100]. The processing temperature was identified to be critical factors that promote the formulation of THH-core nanocrystals. High electro-oxidation activity towards ethanol oxidation is demonstrated with higher peak current and increased CO tolerance, that arise mainly from presence of octahedral Au–Pd core-shell nanocrystals. TEM analysis of intermediate materials shows the development of twisted Pd nanostructures on the Au cores and the existence of certain Pd nanoparticles. THH nanocrystals with completely high-index {730} facets display vastly better electro catalytic behavior than the other two Au–Pd heterostructures with low-index facets. Significant lattice mismatch between Au and Pd, oxidative etching in the vicinity of chloride and oxygen, the use of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride surfactant and the process temperature were established as important factors favoring the formation of THH nanocrystals. First ever attempt to synthesize a hollow Au@Pd core/shell nanostructure by two-step method with a raspberry surface was developed for methanol, ethanol, and formic acid oxidation in alkaline media by Liu et al. [101]. The porous nanospherical gold particles were prepared by galvanic replacement reaction that forms base seeds for the growth of Pd coating comprising raspberry structure. Hollow Au nanospheres were first produced using Co nanoparticles as templates. It is determined that raspberry hollow Au@Pd has displayed improved catalytic performance for oxidation of small organic molecules in alkaline media. Formation of hollow Au@Pd raspberry core-shell morphology has been proved by TEM, SEM, XPS, and UV–vis spectroscopy. Galvanic replacement reactions have been used in many synthetic methods of inorganic hollow nanostructures. The driving force of the galvanic replacement reaction is the result of the significant difference between the reduction potentials of AuCl4−/Au and Co2+/Co. Herein cobalt acted as sacrificial template. Since the lattices of Au and Pd are roughly comparable, the interfacial energy between them is comparatively low. The metallic Pd should therefore be distributed on the already developed layer of hollow Au nanospheres instead of self-nucleating in the solution. Under mild reducing condition, Pd spheres have been developed by the use of ascorbic acid. As-prepared Au@Pd hollow nanosphere demonstrated enhanced performance compared to their individual components. Owing to raspberry structure with erratic Pd grains, higher surface to volume ratio is associated with Au@Pd hollow nanospheres, which is responsible for better electrocatalytic activity towards methanol and ethanol oxidation reactions. The improved electrochemical activity for alcohol oxidation is reflected by lower onset oxidation potential for both methanol and ethanol. It stems from (i) synergy between Au and Pd (ii) the hollow morphology of nanospheres (iii) the presence of highly rough Pd nano outer shell. According to the findings, this hollow Au@Pd core-shell nanostructure with a raspberry layer has exceptional electrocatalytic properties. Alternately, PdPt core surrounded by Pt/C nanostructure electrocatalyst has been synthesized through using a high pressure-colloidal technique whereby a thin Pt layer is deposited over carbon-supported PtPd bimetallic particles [102]. From TEM studies, it can be determined that PtPd@Pt/C possesses an average diameter with a narrow size distribution with fairly good uniform distribution density. The particle size of Pd@Pt/C is lower than that of PtPd@Pt/C, which provides indirect evidence about the core-shell morphology of synthesized catalyst. PtPd@Pt/C catalyst is examined through CV studied performed in sulfuric acid solution wherein an intense oxidation peak is related to hydrogen oxidation that reflects hydrogen storing characteristic of Pd. ECSA of PtPd@Pt/C measured in 0.5 M sulphuric acid is 301.6 m2 g−1. When methanol oxidation is studied using as-prepared catalysts, it is detected that both peak potential and onset potential for methanol oxidation are lower in relation to commercial Pt/C catalyst. The higher peak current density of about 2930 mA mg−1 is achievable with as-formed PdPt@Pt/C catalyst that is nearly 4 times higher than that of commercial catalyst. Both improved dispersion of active material over catalyst support and enhanced interaction between core-shell components together contributed for the observed superior catalyst performance. The ability to remove the poisonous intermediates is also found to be higher as predicted by high If/Ib ratio (1.4). It should be highlighted that higher mass specific current and CO tolerance are articulable due to existence of Pd core that provide more number of active reactive sites for methanol oxidation beyond favoring effective removal of COads. Fuel cell performance is tested using the prepared catalyst as an anode in hydrogen/air fuel cell at 60o C is 354 mWcm−2, which is 80% more in relation to commercial catalysts. Interestingly, an effective single-step approach to prepare triple layered catalyst comparing gold, Palladium and Platinum core-shell nanostructures is reported that involves temporal separation of triple layered unique Au@Pd@Pt, stepwise synthesis of layers from respective colloids [103]. This approach is facile and single-step route that encompass stepwise spontaneous generation of triple coated materials with superior electrocatalytic performance. It is noteworthy that quantity of metal precursor determined the thickness of layered metal therefore catalytic performance could be modulated through altering amount of metal precursors. Initially pre-formed spherical Au nanoparticles acted as in-situ seeds to construction of Pd and Pt shells as determined the characterization studies performed by TEM, FTIR and XPS. For this reason, the PCA particularly those with Au center and Pd shell, where all the surface atoms are of the more catalytically active metal, have emerged as a modern framework for tuning the composition of catalysts to tailor their catalytic properties. To account for the effect of shape and composition, a comparative evaluation of influence of structure and shape on catalyst performance, selectivity of catalysis has been investigated. Since, the catalytic performance high varied with crystallographic planes that end up with nanoparticle surface, controlling shape of nanostructure is one of the best methods to ameliorate activity. It has been proposed that icosahedral, cubic and tetrahedral morphologies exhibit improved activity as compared to spherical ones. This study has been performed to examine important reactions that produce glyceric and lactic acid from glycerol and 1,2 propanediol. Another perspective to explore structural and chemical changes when modifying the reaction atmosphere at room temperature and pressure is investigated with Rh–Pd and Pt–Pd core-shell nanoparticles [104]. The configuration and arrangement of the chemical components within the shell of Rh0.5Pd0.5 nanoparticles have been shown to change completely in response to changes in the composition of the reactant gas, an outcome that shows the structural versatility of the nanoparticles and the interactions of structure and reactivity. The core-shell catalysts are an appealing option for catalytic research attributable to their upgraded oxidation properties, such as selectiveness, interaction and chemical/physical stability. The core-shells are also a way to acquire special designs and frameworks by combining the attributes of the materials that are not really applicable to their individual component predecessors. An approach to synthesize Au@Pd core–shell nanoparticles with uniform shell thickness is also reported which includes preparation of gold core subsequently a three phase-transfer process is employed to obtain homogenous Pd shell [105]. As-formed catalyst present remarkable activity towards methanol electro-oxidation and displayed 40-fold superior electrochemical activity as compared to pure Pd catalyst along with good stability. The proposed synthetic approach consists of two simple steps (i) preparation of Au core (ii) creating Pd shell around Au. Au nanoparticle is synthesized through reduction of chloroauric acid-sodium oleate mixture using ethanol as a reducing agent. Consequently Au@Pd core–shell nanoparticles are synthesized through a three-phase transfer process. Specifically, Au nanoparticles are mixed with sodium oleate, ethylene glycol and de-ionized water, palladium chloride was added into it dropwise, Au@Pd core–shell nanoparticles are obtained by reduction with ethanol. The diameter of Au nanoparticles increased from 5.7 nm to 7.1 nm due to surrounding Pd shell. The If value associated with Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles and Pd nanoparticles are 7.89 mA cm−2 and 1.72 mA cm−2 respectively. This observation proves that Au@Pd electrocatalyst is highly active for methanol electro-oxidation, which is attributed due to upshift in D-band level caused by lattice expansion. The stable and enhanced electrocatalytic response with Au@Pd originates from easy removal of poisonous intermediates adsorbed on the surface, in addition to it, the homogenous Pd shell facilitates fine-tuning the electronic level. Interestingly, PtNiPd core–shell nanowires are prepared via chemical reduction of organic complexes [106]. The unique PtNiPd trimetallic nanowires is successfully fabricated and controlled through ultrathin PtNi bimetal and different reduction potential of metal precursors. By varying the amount of nickel salt, it is possible to manipulate composition of shell material. Both electro-oxidation of ethylene glycol and glycerol displayed superior catalytic activity over PtNi0.56Pd1.42 nanowire core-shell structured catalytic surface along with good electrochemical stability. It is to be noted that electrochemical activity of as-formed catalyst presented an insignificant performance degradation after 2000 potential cycles in acidic medium. Both formations of thin PtNi nanowire as well as dissimilarity in the reduction potential of metals together account for fabricated unique nanostructure. It is observed that TEM images revealed Pd is primarily distributed in the interior of nanowires, whereas Pt and Ni are dispersed along outer-wall of the nanowire. The superior electrocatalytic response obtained for ethylene glycol oxidation with improved mass activity of 560 mA mg−1 Pt and 300 mA mg−1 Pt+Pd. In this work, trimetallic PtNiPd core-shell nanowires are prepared by two-step refluxing process. In a typical run, acetylacetonate derivatives of Pt and Ni salts are combined with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, oelylamine and glucose under ultrasonic treatment, the admixture is refluxed to 160o C. In next step, acetylacetonate salt of Pd in oleylamine is mixed with above prepared solution and refluxed to yield trimetallic PtNiPd core-shell nanowires. The optimized composition of PtNiPd nanowire exhibited improved specific activity (0.44 mA cm−2) and high mass activity (240 mA mg−1 Pt and 140 mA mg−1 Pt+Pd) towards electro-oxidation of glycol and glycerol as compared to commercial Pt/C. The intrinsic properties of unique core-shell nanostructure, high surface area and good electrical conductance are the major causes for the observed results. In addition, these nanowires are associated with high-index facets which help to facilitate electro catalytic activity. The integrated core-shell nanowire is hence reported to be exceptionally useful for construction of high-performance electro catalysts with enhanced catalyst utilization efficiency. With the aim of developing the Pt–Pd core-shell nanostructure as a catalyst for DMFC, controlled synthesis of poly (vinylpyrrolidone) stabilized Pt@Pd nanoparticles of core-shell morphologies has been synthesized by modified polyol method [107]. To oxidize methanol, Pt@Pd nanocatalyst is proven to be potential and is also of low cost as compared to commercial Pt/Ru bimetallic. In this method AgNO3 is used as a modifying reagent that helps to form Pt@Pd core-shell nanocatalyst, when reduced in ethylene glycol as a solvent through reflux. A mixture of Pt/Pd precursor salt dissolved in ethylene glycol is heated under reflux in front of AgNO3 as a modifier and polyvinylpyrrolidne as a stabilizer. The HRTEM images indicated the clear segregation of the Pt core and Pd shell configuration with 16–25 nm of particle size, which also demonstrates presence of thin Pd shells with polyhedral Pt cores in their nucleation, which evidences for the epitaxial shell growth modes. The authors have compared catalytic activity of Pt@Pd core-shell nanoparticles with different size 5–10 nm, 20–30 nm and 5–10 nm. It is inferred from the results that the size of core-shell nanocatalyst have no significant influence on electrocatalytic activity unlike morphology and nanostructure of the materials. In this study, it could also be deduced that presence of Ag tend to control {100} and {111} selective growth modes of single or bimetallic nanoparticles resulting to the formation of nanoparticles with various polyhedral morphologies. There exists a synergy between homogenously dispersed Pt and Pd nanoparticles that greatly promotes kinetics of methanol electro-oxidation. Among the synthesized catalyst, optimized composition showed higher ECSA of 27.7 m2g-1. It should be emphasized that property of nanoshell has a profound influence on controlling bonding of adsorbed poisonous intermediates. Thin nanoshells have been prepared on the surfaces of the shape-controlled nanocores. The catalytic correlations between alloys, clusters and core-shell bimetallic nanoparticles are made to confirm the best nanostructures for high catalytic activity. The catalytic properties of combined nanocatalysts of single, cluster, alloy and bimetallic nanoparticles of varying sizes and morphologies are assumed. Pd–Pt core-shell exhibited 1.4 Acm−2 with lower onset potential of 0.65 V. Specifically, symmetry and regular arrangement of atomic layers predict the activity of core-shell morphology. They are of well-controlled core-shell morphology. It is inferable from the electrochemical experiments that Pt@Pd core-shell morphology of the Pd nanoshell displaying their fine atomic arrangement is better than Pd@Pt core-shell morphology of the Pt nanoshell, which is ascribed due to ligand effect in a complete core-shell structure. Therefore, the improvement of catalytic activity concerning Pt core is completely attributed to the electronic effect of the core Pt being surrounded by Pd. In turn, a simple chemical reduction method is demonstrated to prepare Pt surrounded by Ru, Fe3O4, Pd shell materials to enhance methanol and ethanol oxidation kinetics with the aim of developing anode for fuel cells [108]. This work demonstrated mechanical agitation method for fast and efficient preparation of core-shell morphology using sodium borohydride as a reducing agent. Among different catalysts studied, Ru@Pt exhibited higher activity for both methanol and ethanol oxidation, which is demonstrated through CV and chornoamperometry studies. The evaluation of the electrochemical stability displayed that the Ru@Pt and Fe3O4@Pt core-shell nanostructures are durable electrocatalyst and are therefore suitable to be used as electrode materials in acid medium. Often high surface area carbon is used as a catalytic support to enhance ECSA and thereby electroactivity, similarly core-shell nanoparticles are also supported over carbon and investigated for alcohol oxidation electrocatalyst [109]. AuPd/C core–shell and alloy nanoparticles with enhanced catalytic activity toward the electro-oxidation of ethanol in alkaline media are also investigated with the aim of improving catalytic mass activity toward ethanol oxidation. Pd–Au bimetallic alloy catalysts were synthesized through the concurrent reduction of metal chlorides (Au and Pd) by NaBH4. Metal salts with appropriate ratio dissolved in dilute HCl are subjected to sonication with carbon support. Ammonium hydroxide is added to mixture for increasing pH to 11 followed by addition of NaBH4 and stirred vigorously to obtain a series of Pd–Au catalyst of different composition. The molar ratios between Au and Pd were maintained as 80:20 for the core-shell catalyst and 10:90, 30:70, 50:50, 70:30 and 80:20 for the alloy catalysts. Electrochemical oxidation studies demonstrated that the addition of Au enrich electrocatalytic activity of the material substantially. The enhanced performance is due to the bifunctional effect of carbon supported alloys as well as the synergetic effect on Au@Pd/C. It should be emphasized that outer noble core prevents dissolution resistance of core-shell catalysts. TEM images of prepared catalyst presents a particle size distribution of sizes about 4–6 nm with typical spherical geometry. The best result of electrocatalyst-forming alloys can indeed be related to the bi-functional process, where more Pd atoms are accessible for ethanol adsorption, and Au supplies oxygen molecules for partial oxidation. The CV studies in 0.5 M KOH/0.5 M ethanol reveal that mass activity value is two times more for Pd–Au alloy compared to Pd alone. It may be deduced that with carbon supported Au@Pd catalyst, due to the downshift in the Pd D-band center there is a considerable enhancement in mass activity that originates from bimetallic nanostructure. This shift in the D-band help to eliminate carbon intermediate products formed during electro-oxidation as well as assist with hydrogen adsorption process. Among various catalysts prepared, it is determined that lower poisoning rate is accounted for the core–shell catalysts as compared to all the catalysts studied. Mitigated surface poisoning effect related with core–shell electrocatalyst compared to other catalysts proved that unfavorable accumulation of intermediate species formed during the ethanol oxidation reaction. This improved anti-poisoning effect could be explained on the basis of electronic effect created by modified energy levels. It is important to point out that the electronic effect caused through modified Pd binding energy levels is the major factor that decreased adsorption energy of intermediate on Pd and promotes C–H cleavage on Pd sites. In situ FTIR experiments detected that the major product associated with ethanol oxidation is acetate ion and core-shell morphology tend to present minimum acetate generation. It is also inferred that CO2 is predominately produced that is formed due to cleavage of C–C bond. In recent past, tiny-sized ionic liquid-derived Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles using ionic liquid (1-(2′-aminoethyl)-3-methyl-imidazolum tetrafluoroborate) as a stabilizing agent is prepared [110]. An aqueous solution of HAuCl4.4H2O salt solution in alkaline solution is subjected to chemical reduction using sodium borohydride to produce Au cores. To achieve Au@Pd core-shell, sodium salt of palladium chloride is added into the prepared colloid followed by addition of aqueous sodium citrate solution in presence of ionic liquid that acts as s stabilizer. Au@Pd core-shell obtained are quite different from conventionally prepared one because presence of ionic liquid modifies diffusion characteristics of Pd and Au ions within reactive matrix, causes change in the particle growth reaction through altering viscosity and dielectric constant of reaction media. It is highlighted that the physical and chemical properties of Au@Pd are influenced by the presence of ionic liquid. The durable electronic coupling between Au core and Pd shell bestows the Pd shell with an electronic structure promising for the ethanol oxidation reaction. Within this work, it is aimed to combine the advantages of ionic liquid in the preparation of core-shell tiny nanostructures that leads to seed-mediated development process for generating Au@Pd nanoparticles with core-shell. This work employs 1-(2′-aminoethyl)-3-methyl-imidazolum tetrafluoroborate as a stabilizer to create Au seeds with an average diameter of 2.41 nm in an alkaline medium. The as-synthesized Au@Pd are spherical or quasi-spherical shaped. The average diameter of them is 2.41 nm with narrow particle size distribution as evidenced by HRTEM images. Electrochemical cycling studies demonstrated that ethanol electro-oxidation current of Au@Pd core-shell catalyst in alkaline media displayed a pair of irreversible characteristic peaks for ethanol oxidation consistent to the oxidation of ethanol in the forward scan and the oxidative removal of carbonaceous intermediates generated in the backward scan. Au/Pd molar ratios are varied to fabricate core-shell structures, of which the ionic liquid-derived core-shell Au@Pd nanoparticles comprising 1:1 ratio (Au: Pd) exhibited highest mass-and area-based activities. As shown, the electrocatalytic activity towards ethanol electro-oxidation is roughly 11-fold higher than those of commercial Pd/C catalyst under same reactive conditions. The electrocatalytic activity is profoundly influenced by ratio between Pd and Au metals, it is determined that catalyst with equal ratio outperforms others. Comprehensively, for Au seeds, characteristic peaks are located at 0.23 V in the forward sweep and 0.04 V in the backward sweep, respectively. For the core-shell Au@Pd nanoparticles at Au/Pd ratio of 1/0.2 (Au@Pd-0.2), the oxidation peaks for ethanol in the forward scan and for carbonaceous intermediate species in backward sweep shift to 0.12 V and −0.01 V, respectively. This shift is lower than those of pristine Au seeds, indicating that deposition of Pd on Au seeds promotes the ethanol oxidation. Eon of ethanol is −0.59 V which is 500 mV less than that of core-shell Au@Pd-0.4 catalyst, 300 mV less than that of core-shell Au@Pd-0.8 catalyst and 100 mV less than that of core-shell Au@Pd-1.2 catalyst. Also, peak current density associated with forward scan is higher for Au@Pd-1.0 catalyst (57.15 mg Pd−1) in comparison with other catalysts namely Au@Pd0.4, (26200 mA mgPd−1) and Au@Pd-0.8, (39600 mA mgPd−1). These results approve that the mass specific activity for ethanol oxidation is more when equimolar ratio is maintained for core-shell catalysts in comparison with other counterparts. ECSA measured from CO stripping by CV studies illustrated 74.9 m2 g−1 for Au@Pd-1.0 core shell catalyst and 62.6 m2 g−1 for commercial Pd/C, respectively. It is worth mentioning that increased surface area is attributed to small particle size of Au@Pd-1.0 core shell catalyst which is responsible for more catalyst utilization and enhanced mass specific activity. Currently, a series of core-shell structured PdAg@Pd worm-like networks catalysts with modulated surface morphology and surface area are prepared and used to study electrochemical ethanol oxidation [111]. The advanced nanostructured system exhibited excellent catalytic performance towards ethanol oxidation reaction compared to that of commercial Pd/C catalysts in alkaline media when composition is kept optimal. The core-shell catalyst with Pd in it outer layer offers high electrical conductivity along with maximum Pd utility owing to presence of plentiful defective sites which essentially enhanced the surface area. Together combined with the advantages of core-shell morphology and networked features, core-shell structured PdAg@Pd worm-like network catalyst is prepared through a simple one-pot approach by reducing Pd(acac)2 and AgNO3. Different compositions of Pd76Ag24 and Pd85Ag15 catalysts were obtained by controlling weights of metal precursor salts. The TEM examination of Pd76Ag24 core-shell nanostructure reveals homogenous distribution of wire like nanostructure with a mean size of 11.7 nm. The XRD pattern of as-prepared catalyst presents prominent reflection of {1 1 1}, {2 0 0}, {2 2 0}, {3 1 1} and {2 2 2} planes of the fcc alloy at 2θ value of 38.9, 45.4, 66.4, 79.4 and 84.5 correspondingly. In addition to this, the XPS studies were carried out to examine surface chemical composition and valence state of Pd76Ag24, peaks appeared at 334.9 eV and 340.2 eV were ascribed to metallic Pd of Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2, while the other two peaks at 336.0 eV and 342.7 eV were related to the Pd (II) of Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2, respectively. The presence of the intermetallic PdAg center and Pd shell, synergistic impact and electronics influence between the center PdAg aids to facilitate fast kinetics. Besides, presence of Pd shell may be favorable towards electrocatalytic efficiency. CV studies conducted in 1 M KOH in presence and absence of ethanol is represented by Fig. S4. From the CV of Pd76Ag24 core-shell catalyst, a peak which meant the reduction of Pd oxide was detected at 0.34 V. This potential has been positively shifted by about 30 mV in relation to commercial Pd/C. It is to be expressed that incorporation of Ag into Pd to form PdAg alloy enhanced the reduction of PdO. A typical electrochemical response for ethanol oxidation is illustrated by as-prepared catalyst. The anodic oxidation current is higher for Pd76Ag24 along with good mass specific activity (3480 mA mgPd−1). Fig.S4d exhibits specific activity of catalysts, superior activity is seen for Pd76Ag24 WNWs. Likewise, a facile one-pot wet chemical synthesis is adopted to prepare well-shaped PtPd@Pd core-shell nanospheres by utilizing using N-methylimidazole as a structure directing agent and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) as a capping agent [112]. The as-prepared nanocomposites displayed the enhanced electrocatalytic performance along with better stability when used as an electrocatalyst for oxidation of methanol, ethylene glycol oxidation in alkaline medium as well as oxygen reduction in acidic conditions. HRTEM studies demonstrated that each nanosphere exhibit dandelion-like porous nanostructures with an average diameter of 20 nm and narrow size distribution is also established. It is demonstrated that through changing Pt/Pd molar ratio of precursor solutions, it is possible to control structure and shape of these nanospheres. It should be noted that ECSA of PtPd@Pd core-shell nanosphere is as high as 29.72 m2 g−1 when measured by CO stripping cycling studies. Under identical experimental conditions, the current density associated with both methanol and ethylene glycol oxidation for PtPd@Pd catalyst higher than other catalysts under study. Likewise, one-step method is established for large-scale synthesis of core-shell Pd@Pt dendritic nanocrystals supported on reduced graphene oxide, wherein poly (ethylene oxide) played a dual role as a structure directing agent as well as a stabilizer [113]. The specific mass activity of as-prepared catalysts is 1210.0 mA mg−1 and 1128.5 mA mg−1 towards methanol and ethanol oxidation, respectively. The observed results originate mainly from consequence of the synergism between Pd and Pt of the dendritic core-shell nanostructures, as well as reduced graphene oxide as a support. In this line, AuPd@Pd nanocrystals are synthesized by a facile green route approach using Good's buffer, 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethane sulfonic acid as a reducing agent and a shape-directing agent, here AuPd@Pd nanocrystals are dispersed on graphene nanosheets [114]. Microstructural analysis revealed that the average particle size for Graphene/Au, Graphene/Pd and Pd black samples are 38.39 nm, 36.53 and 18.55 nm respectively. HR-TEM analysis of as-synthesized AuPd@Pd nanoparticles demonstrate the fine crystalline and continuous lattice fringes marked from the AuPd core to Pd shell in a single AuPd@Pd particle. ECSA estimated by CO desorption-electrooxidation 93.2 m2 g−1. The ORR studies conducted with as-prepared electrocatalyst in N2-saturated 0.5 M sulphuric acid at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 illustrated more positive onset potential coupled with specific kinetic current densities and mass kinetic current densities. Also, highest mass activity and specific activity are observed for methanol oxidation in alkaline medium when compared to commercial catalyst. Eon for methanol oxidation is determined to be 100 and 70 mV, which is more negative than Graphene/Pd and Pd black catalysts respectively. It is noticed that the specific activity of the Graphene/AuPd@Pd is 0.695 mA cm−2 but this value is only 0.303 mA cm−2 and 0.605 mA cm−2 for Graphene/Pd and Pd black respectively. It is notable that the mass activity follows the order Graphene/AuPd@Pd (0.650 mA mg−1) > Graphene/Pd (0.218 mA mg−1) > Graphene/Pd (0.053 mA mg−1). The authors attributed these observed higher performance as due to synergism that is existing among Au and Pd nanomaterials, enhanced active surface sites and surface area provided by the presence of enriched abundant atomic steps, edges, and corner atoms located on the shell material. It should be noted that graphene as a catalyst support helps preventing aggregation of particles and thereby resulted in enlarge surface area, its high conductance also aided to boost up electron transfer kinetics. Later, a simple co-reduction method is evolved to fabricate highly dendritic PtPd@Pd core-shell nanocrystals supported on reduced graphene oxide and its catalytic activity for glycerol oxidation is demonstrated [115]. With high ECSA (51.65 m2 g−1), dendritic PtPd@Pd core-shell nanocrystals displayed 1.3 times higher peak current density as compared to commercial catalyst. Besides, same electrocatalyst exhibited good hydrogen reduction property also, Tafel slope of 28 mV dec−1 is achievable for hydrogen evolution reaction. In recent report, a dentric nanocrystalline PtPd@Pt core-shell with enhanced electro-oxidation performance has been investigated [116]. In the similar line, Liu et al., has developed reduced graphene oxide supported PtPd@Pt core-shell nanocrystals by a facile and green wet-chemical synthetic route with the use of formic acid as the reducing agent for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction in acidic and alkaline media [117]. Fig. 8 schematically the steps involved in the preparation of catalyst. The TEM studies on as-prepared catalyst exhibited that nanocrystals consist of many small grains, with the average particle size of 1–2 nm, its good crystalline nature is confirmed by selective area electron diffraction pattern. ECSA calculated by CO stripping voltammetry is found to be 62.19 m2 g−1 Pt, which is more than that of Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts. Evidently, mass activity and (If/Ib) ratio associated with ethylene glycol oxidation is determined as 230 mA mg−1 and 1.29 for as-formed catalyst, illustrating higher electrocatalytic ability, enhanced CO tolerance and better stability of the catalyst. With the aim of developing high-performing DMFC catalyst, He et al., invented a one-pot synthetic strategy to prepare porous dandelion-like Au@Pd supported on reduced graphene oxide and evaluated its activity for methanol electro-oxidation [118]. The strong bonding among reduced graphene oxide and Au@Pd core-shell nanocrystals established favorable synergy that boosted up the catalytic performance. This method provided a new line for rational design and construction of shape-controlled electrocatalyst through in situ synthesis without using any hard template. Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride and iodide ion play imperative role in this method that are used to control or regulate particle size, Pd outer-shell thickness and composition. These parameters are important for improving the catalytic activity. The effects of as-synthesized nanocomposites' function and distribution on catalytic efficiency are studied. In alkaline conditions, the dandelion-like Au@Pd/rGO catalyst had higher catalytic activity and resistance to carbonaceous species poisoning than Pd/rGO and industrial Pd/C catalysts. Recently, uniform core-shell Au–Pd@Pd nanocrystals were prepared using allantoin as a structure-directing agent by one-step wet-chemical co-reduction process, without the use of any pre-made seed, toxic organic solvent, surfactant, or polymer [119]. The as-formed electrocatalyst is studied for ethylene glycol oxidation in alkaline media which is demonstrated to have low Eon (0.49 V) and high peak current density (91.1 mA. cm−2) with high (If/Ib) ratio as high as 2.41. Formation mechanism is well-explained by authors that relies on difference in the reduction potential between negatively charged AuCl4 − and PdCl4 2−, that are capable of interacting strongly with positive charged allantoin. The attached allantoin molecules can tune the final morphologies by their selective adsorption ability to specific crystal planes of Au–Pd nuclei, as illustrated in this study. The chronoamperometry studies performed at 0.2 V for 5000s clearly revealed stable catalytic response of prepared electrocatalyst for ethylene glycol oxidation. The improved catalytic efficiency of Au–Pd@Pd NCs can be attributed to two factors: i) The synergistic effects of Pd and Au play an important role in increased catalytic activity and longevity (ii) The distinct nanostructures increase the precise surface area and make more active sites available for reactant molecules, thus enhancing the ethylene glycol oxidation mechanism."
8,Hydrothermal synthesis,"3.3 Hydrothermal synthesis Hydrothermally synthesized core-shell nanoparticles comprised of Pd and Mo that on MWNT under various pH conditions are investigated as methanol oxidation electro catalyst in alkaline medium [120]. Core-shell structure is originated as a consequence of reduction potential and surface segregation properties of Pd and Mo. A single step pH controlled hydrothermal method employed here resulted in the yield of core-shell PdMo nanoparticles, the particle size of them depends on pH of reaction medium. The average particle size as determined by TEM studies is found to be 4.7 nm–39.3 nm. The mechanism of formation of core-shell nanostructure is enlightened on the grounds of surface segregation theory that relies on tendency of a metal to separate to the surface of another metal thereby governing alloy surface composition. Pd forms outer cover over Mo because of its lower surface energy as a result energy of the system gets diminished. Nevertheless, surface segregation in PdMo nanoparticles over MWNT might be influenced by many factors such as surface energy difference between individual metals and particle size, synthesis procedure and nanoparticles-support interaction. The values for the interplanar spacing corresponding to (111) plane is calculated from HRTEM micrographs for Pd, Pd@Mo and Mo@Pd nanoparticles. From these studies it is measured as 2.28, 2.23, 2.24, 2.24 and 2.25 Å respectively for Pd, Pd@Mo and Mo@Pd nanoparticles. From XPS studies, it could be inferred that small variation of binding energy level of Pd has been introduced by Mo. Binding energy of Pd is measured to be lower than that of pure Pd particles by 0.3eV. It could be inferred from XPS that (i) the electronic structure of Pd is modified due to presence of Mo (ii) the binding energy level is influenced by particle size that stems from changing states density near Fermi energy level that result in modification of electrocatalytic activity of Pd towards electro-oxidation process. However, a high loading of catalysts obstructs active triple phase boundaries formation in that way subsequent in lack of sufficient active catalyst centers and consequently low catalyst loading is preferred in this work. ECSA is measured to be 60.90 m2 g−1, 23.77 m2 g−1, 36.57 m2 g−1, 32.92 m2 g−1 and 38.40 m2 g−1 for Pd/MWCNT, Pd@Mo/MWNT (pH 2), Mo@Pd/MWNT (pH 5), Pd@Mo/MWNT (pH 7) and Mo@Pd/MWNT (pH 9) in that order. From the CV studies it is found that Eon for methanol oxidation with Pd@Mo/MWNT catalyst is quite low that is also associated with higher peak current density as compared their individual components. It is also deduced that catalyst prepared at pH 9 displays higher oxidation kinetics. The stability of prepared catalysts was examined by chroammperometry in 1 M KOH/1 M methanol by applying a constant potential of 0.2 V. Mo@Pd/MWCNT synthesized at pH 9 displayed higher durability. This observation could be explained on the basis of difference in D-band character when Mo is doped with Pd. Generally, reaction rate of bimetallic is determined lattice constants, center of D-band of bimetal move in compliance with lattice constants. Higher energy D-band center facilitates adsorption of intermediates, owing to lowered D-band level PdMo surface is less prone to catalytic poisoning. It was aimed to modulate reactivity Pd using cost effective Mo for methanol oxidation in alkaline medium is described in this report. Of late, a simple single-step method of fabricating Au–Pd core-shell and polycrystalline alloy bimetallic nanostructures through hydrothermal co-reduction technique has also been evolved using HAuCl4 and H2PdCl4 as precursor's materials and polyvinyl pyrrolidone as the reductant [121]. As-produced nanostructures exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance for reduction reaction of oxygen in alkaline media. The controllable preparation and excellent electrocatalytic properties proposed them low-cost Pd-based cathodic electrocatalyst. The over potential of oxygen reduction gets reduced significantly, and the peak potential is positive-shifted with good electrocatalytic response. Although it is used to study oxygen reduction kinetics, the electrocatalyst is proposed for alcohol oxidation reaction also. Recently, preparation of a bio carbon-supported Ni@Pd core-shell particles through hydrothermal method for its application as an active anode catalyst in DEFCs has been evolved by Silva et al., [122]. Probably, it is first ever report that dealt on preparation and physicochemical characterization of Ni@Pd core-shell electrocatalyst via hydrothermal synthesis for its utilization towards electrochemical ethanol oxidation. For the first time, a biomass hydrothermal liquefaction is explored for synthesis of Ni@Pd core-shell supported over bio carbon and evaluated their electro catalytic performance. Morphological and chemical properties of catalyst are characterized in order to confirm the core-shell particle formation using TEM, EDS, XRD and XPS analyses. The large-sized nanoparticles with average dimension of 266 nm were observed from TEM images. EDS analysis designated that as-formed catalyst is comprises mainly 78.2 wt % of Ni and 20.2 wt % Pd. The pre-determined amount of nickel and palladium salts were mixed with Eucalyptus globulus biomass and subjected for hydrothermal treatment to obtain PdONiO-biomass composite. This hydrochar was treated with CO2 activation treatment at high temperature to achieve Ni@Pd/biomass catalyst. TEM results prove the heterogeneous morphology of catalyst with an average diameter of 6.1 nm that are composed of Pd, O and Ni as main constituents. Crystalline structure is seen at center of particle with an interplanar distance of 0.21 nm. XPS studies prove existence of Ni at high oxidation state possibly present as an oxide or hydroxide species. CV carried out in alkaline medium proved formation of peaks associated with adsorption-desorption of hydrogen over catalyst surface attributed to the formation of PdO layer. Cathodic peak is formed due to reduction of PdO layer produced during the anodic sweep. Ethanol oxidation is studied using the catalyst, typical anodic and cathodic peaks achieved that resembles pure Pd catalyst. In the anodic forward scan, the current starts to increase drastically from −0.35 V (vs Hg/HgO) up to a maximum value of 180 A m−2 at 0.03 V. This value may be connected to the onset potential of the ethanol oxidation reaction over NiPd catalysts. Using ATFTIR studies, authors derived a conclusion that acetate ion is the main product in ethanol oxidation reaction with prepared catalyst. The acteate ions commence to be produced from −0.3 V (vs. Hg/HgO) that is in agreement with onset potential of ethanol oxidation reaction. The highly active methanol oxidation electrocatalyst AuPd@Pd nanocrystals supported on three-dimensional porous N-doped reduced graphene oxide hydrogel is synthesized adopting hydrothermal wet chemical co-reduction approach by Yu et al., using ethylenediamine as nitrogen source and structure directing agent [123]. The specific activity and mass activity for as-formed catalyst is 0.98 mA cm−2 and 620.3 mA mg−1 respectively. The enhanced catalytic activity of AuPd@Pd NCs/N-RGOH is due to the effects of AuPd@Pd NCs as well as the special properties of N-RGOH. Core-shell structure can alter the D-band center of exterior Pd atoms, making it easier to combine methanol molecules resulting in improved oxidation kinetics. Stability of AuPd@Pd NCs/N-RGOH was confirmed by the accelerate durability tests in 1.0 M methanol/0.5 potassium hydroxide, only 7% current density has been diminished after 500 cycles, the current densities of AuPd@Pd decreased nearly by 15% after 1000 cycles. The special 3D intertwined porous nanostructures and abundant N- and O-containing groups on N-reduced graphene oxide surfaces provide more efficient anchoring cites for homogeneous dispersion of the core-shell nanocrystals, endowing the nanocomposites with highly catalytic efficiency for electro-oxidation by collective synergy. In a short time, a hawthorn sherry ball shaped Pd-based electrocatalyst in presence of ionic liquid and surfactant following two-step hydrothermal process has been explored for preparation of ethanol oxidation catalyst [124]. Initially, micron-scale solid carbon spheres were prepared in presence of glucose, an ionic liquid of 1-butyl-3-methyl tetrafluoroboric acid. Followed by this second hydrothermal step, Pd particles were immobilized on the surface of micron-scale solid carbon spheres to achieve hawthorn sherry ball shaped Pd-based composite catalyst. The room temperature ionic liquid is capable of influencing the growth process and crystalline properties of nanometals. The as-prepared catalyst is characterized through XRD, XPS and SEM studies. XRD diffraction peaks of at 40.1°, 46.5°, 68.0°, 82.0° and 86.8° can be well respectively assigned to the reflection plane (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) asserting that metallic palladium in the catalyst exist as face-centered-cubic polycrystalline structure. The electrocatalytic efficiency of as-prepared catalyst is evaluated through CV studies using ethanol in alkaline medium. Electrochemical oxidation of ethanol is manifested in CV as forward and backward sweeps. The cycling stability of electrochemical ethanol oxidation reaction on a catalyst is also a crucial feature that is thoroughly interconnected with the serve life of a catalyst, which is further studied through chronoamperometry analysis. Among four different kinds of catalysts studied, electrocatalyst prepared using sodium dodecyl sulphate as a surfactant displayed remarkably higher current response. The faradaic current density of 0.3 mA cm−2 is observed which is nearly twenty times higher than that of other catalysts. This study proved that carbon microsphere of size 12 μm with a uniform distribution is prepared through hydrothermal synthesis with the aid of surfactant and ionic liquid, also Pd could be impregnated through hydrothermal process, and thereby it is possible to develop efficient ethanol oxidation catalyst."
9,Microwave-assisted synthesis,"3.4 Microwave-assisted synthesis In the view of many advantages such as quick volumetric heating, good control over shape and composition, facile method of modifying the metallic structures, microwave synthesis-solution method is regarded as an effectual approach to prepare nanomaterials. In general, the homogeneous heating of the reagents in microwave synthesis mitigates thermal gradients and maintains uniform nucleation and growth conditions resulted in the creation of nanomaterials with a consistent shape and composition [125]. The metal nanostructure nucleation occurs quickly when reaction carried under microwave conditions rather than conventional heating as well it enhances reaction arte and product yield owing to homogenous reaction medium maintained within the reactive environment. This methodology has been extended to prepare core-shell nanostructure recently. The process of microwave-assisted polyol reduction was adapted to the formulation of core-shell AuPd bimetallic nanoparticles by the concurrent reduction of Au and Pd ions [126]. The polyol reduction is a well-known method to develop to the preparation of metal nanostructures especially applicable for metals that get reduced easily. Microwave-assisted synthesis is advantageous in terms of homogenous reaction medium, efficiency with good yield, less time consuming processes and offer precise control over morphology and size of nanostructures. This method has been applied to achieve core-shell Au/Pd bimetallic nanoparticles for first time by the simultaneous reduction of the metal ions. This method is quite simple, was accomplished by mixing palladium (II) chloride and hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (III) in ethylene glycol solvent medium at equal molar amount. The nitrogen gas is purged into the system and reaction is carried out for 1 h to obtain desired product. Nanoalloys with core-shell structures are a class of potential catalysts for fuel cell applications, the core-shell structure being a shell the relatively supplemented by one metal than another. A new ternary-nanocatalyst FeCo@Fe@Pd/C for alcohol oxidation has been prepared through microwave method of heating comparing Pd based core-shell morphology [127]. The as-prepared core-shell structures are tolerant towards catalyst poisoning caused by carbaneous intermediates created through alcohol oxidation and are durable materials with good stability. The electrochemical oxidation of different alcohols such as glycerol, ethylene glycol and ethanol are studied and the results are matched with the performance of commercial Pd/C catalyst. The superior activity shown by FeCo@Fe@Pd/C catalyst towards electroxidation for three alcohols under consideration, activity is found to be maximum for oxidation of ethylene glycol in alkaline medium. The kinetics of ethylene glycol oxidation is 2 fold higher as compared to ethanol and 4 fold higher than glycerol oxidation kinetics. The low charge-transfer-resistance offered for ethylene glycol oxidation at the interface actually boosts the kinetics of reaction. A new route is discussed here, Fe-based alloy core being surrounded by Pd outer shell has been synthesized through one step top-down nanostructuring and decoration assisted with the use of microwave irradiation. In a single step, iron nano particles are produced from huge-sized soft magnetic iron-cobalt @Fe/C core-shell nanostructure fixed up with Pd shell has been achieved. The carbon supported FeCo catalyst was obtained through heating equimolar mixture of iron-cobalt chloride salts dispersed over carbon to 300o C under hydrogen/argon atmosphere followed by annealing at 500o C for 2 h. The core-shell morphology is obtained when the admixture is cooled under argon atmosphere. Pd decorated FeCo catalyst is formed when palladium chloride and FeCo admixture are combined and subjected to microwave reaction condition using ethylene glycol as solvent at 500 W for 15 min. In general, smaller sized atom with higher cohesive energy prefers core portion while larger nuclei occupies outer shell structure. Accordingly, Co acts as core in FeCo core-shell structure, however Pd surrounded the FeCo/Fe nanocatalyst. The CV studies prove that prepared nanocatalyst exhibits higher ECSA indicative of benefit of core-shell architecture towards enhancing electrocatalytic reaction. The improvement in performance level could also be related to change in electronic structure that influence the catalytic activity. The DFT studies suggested that the improved performance is due to existence of favorable interaction among components. Also, the core-shell nanoparticle catalytic activity originates from mix of improved CO-free surface availability for Pd nanoparticles sites and low temperature hydrogen-mediated sites. The enhanced catalytic response is attributed due to alteration of electronic level of Pd that leads to tune its catalytic behavior due to lattice contraction effect caused by compressive strain within lattice. The metal D-band center of Pd is downshifted due to lattice strain caused by the introducing iron and cobalt atoms. The carbonaceous intermediates adsorbed during alcohol oxidation exhibit weakened interaction over catalyst surface due to downshift of D-band. The diminished adsorptive strength of the poisonous intermediates over Pd shell favors facile exclusion of intermediates and thereby promotes catalytic activity. The factor If/Ib associated with ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol oxidation are 1.28, 2.81 and 2.33 respectively. Recently, microwave assisted two-step synthetic technique has been developed to prepare nickel core–palladium shell nanoclusters on nitrogen-doped graphene and evaluated as an electrocatalyst for ethanol oxidation reaction [128]. In this method, nitrogen-doped graphene played dual role as both active material and supporting medium owing to its high dispersing ability and reducing property. Since, the metal nanoparticles intermingle intensely with the nitrogen-doped graphene surface, it is possible to highly disperse Pd–Ni bimetals with good stability. The afore-mentioned research findings indicate that nitrogen doping of supporting catalyst materials can provide small particles sizes and high dispersion of nanoparticles by catalyst, solid electronic bonding between the supply and the catalyst modification of catalysts and increase of aid electronic structure. Because nanoparticles of the metal strongly interact with the graphene with nitrogen doped surface, can be distributed widely and display great graphene surface stability, and interaction between Ni core and Pd shell, that create Ni@Pd/NG. A relatively conductive network for easy access and transfer of masses has been created. Being distributed over graphene surface, interaction between Ni core and Pd shell is enhanced, which make Ni@Pd/NG establish a properly conductive framework to facilitate both charge-transfer and mass-transfer processes. Initially nickel deposited N-doped graphene is prepared by intermittent microwave irradiation using nickel acetate as a precursor. Under ultrasonic treatment, Ni–Pd core-shell structure is obtained through displacing nickel ions with palladium. Ni@Pd core-shell over nitrogen doped graphene and its electro catalytic activity and stability for the oxidation of alcohol is followed using electrochemical studies. Pd metal consumption has been reduced drastically, interaction exist among Pd and Ni leads to shift in D-band energy center, that is advantageous for supporting electrochemical activity and stability of Ni@Pd/NG nanostructure. XRD pattern of prepared catalyst show strong peaks of Pd and Ni crystallites of FCC phase with average diameter of 2.8 nm. In XRD pattern, diffraction peaks 2θ at 40.1°, 46.5°, and 68.2° could be indexed to the characteristic (111), (200) and (220) cubic crystalline structured Pd. A positive peaks is evident clearly associated with Pd happened on Ni@Pd/NG compared with the Pd/NG, indicating the Ni atoms entered into the Pd crystals, which caused a very small change of the Pd crystal lattice. From TEM studies, it was apparent that defective sites formed due to the nitrogen doping act as anchoring centers to produce homogenous dispersion of Ni@Pd core-shell particles over the graphene surface. Voltammetric studies in 1.0 M KOH +1.0 M ethanol prove that Ni@Pd/NG is superior catalyst with high fouling resistant. Mass activity of the ethanol oxidation with Ni@Pd/NG, Pd/NG and Pd/C is 3650 mA mg−1 Pd, 2435 mA mg−1 Pd and 1528 mA mg−1 Pd respectively. Ni@Pd/NG electrode showed 4.5 fold higher the peak current density as that on Pd/C electro catalyst demonstrating explicitly higher efficiency of Ni@Pd/NG catalyst. Beneficial effect of N-doped graphene with high surface area favors uniform dispersion of the Ni@Pd nanoparticles resulting in enhanced charge transfer rate. Besides, presence of nickel aid to increase adsorption of OH and favors OHads coverage that eventually improved reaction rate. The chronoammaperometric studies also prove highest steady state current density possessing good durability for prepared core-shell catalyst. The authors have explained the observed results based on superior electroclatalytic activity of Ni@Pd core-shell nanostructure that has different intermetallic surface structure due to downshifted D-band energy level. Ligand effect operating between core and shell nanoparticles is capable of promoting desorption rate of poisonous carbon based intermediates including CO form Pd and therefore enhance the ethanol electro-oxidation kinetics. In addition to this, availability more number of active catalyst zones created due to uniform dispersion of high surface area support also contribute to stability and poisoning tolerance ability of the catalyst. Utilizing nickel as a core, substantially reduced Pd mass loading and enhanced catalytic performance. This impressive development in the electro catalytic performance may provide unique knowledge into the other graphene metallic systems and the preparation of good electro catalyst materials for alcohol oxidation for fuel cells. Recently, the CeO2–Pd nanostructures deposited over nitrogen-doped core-shell mesoporous carbon sphere support has been prepared by microwave-assisted method that exhibit remarkable electro catalytic activity, along with significant improvement in kinetics and stability of Methanol oxidation reaction studied using alkaline medium [129]. Pd dispersion is favored owing to the core-shell morphology of support with copious porosity, deposited Pd acted as adsorption sites for dispersion of CeO2. Adequate interaction between CeO2 and precious metal particles are very important for enhancing the promotional role for the development of catalytic activity. CeO2 dots prepared by thermal decomposition were deposited over substrate subsequently, Pd is deposited over carbon support through polyol microwave synthesis. Optimal ratio of Pd and CeO2 are investigated in detail for achieving better electrocatalytic activity and stability. HRTEM images of as-prepared catalyst demonstrated homogenously distributed particles with average diameter of 13 nm. The porous nature of carbon support plays a central role for improved dispersion of catalyst particles that results in creation of more number of active catalytic centers generated between Pd, carbon support and CeO2. Readily available porous mass is capable of incorporating Pd2+ions that regulate Pd particle size, pre-deposited CeO2 dots in the pore structure may also stable and prevent Pd nanoparticles agglomeration. Highly distributed and ultra-fine Pd nanoparticles are helpful for the increased ECSA and improvement of mass activity towards methanol electro-oxidation. BET studies also support the observation that measured surface area is 464.7 m2 g−1. The potential cycling studies with 1 M methanol/1 M KOH electrolyte indicate that peak current density of the Pd–CeO2/NMCS catalyst is noticeably higher than that of Pd/C and Pd/NMCS. Accordingly, Pd–CeO2/NMCS catalyst presents more ECSA (47.2 m2 g−1), than that of other catalysts under study. Due to the promotional activity of CeO2 as surrounding shell, prepared catalyst exhibit improved CO tolerance. As determined from XPS, favorable electronic interaction is operating among Pd and CeO2 with nitrogen doped carbon support that would be advantageous for electrocatalytic efficacy. As-synthesized catalyst with unique mesoporous morphology comprising Pd/CeO2 is fabricated with 3D porous network is desirable for higher methanol oxidation electro catalysis. A distinct spherical microstructure is exhibited by catalyst as evident from TEM and SEM observations. It is illustrious that the surplus amount of CeO2 in catalysts would compromise electron conductivity and block active sites of Pd. The measured current density of after 1 h was found to be 109.4 mA mg−1 as evident from chronoammperometry studies. In Fig. S5 (A) configuration of polymer fiber membrane-based membrane-electrode assembly and a DMFC design. (B) polarization and power density plots of Pd–CeO2/NMCS (5 mg cm−2) and PtRu/C (5 mg cm−2) catalysts at 20 °C and ambient pressure. The cathode was a NiCo2O4 catalyst. The anode aqueous solution was 4.0 M KOH and 5.0 M methanol. The oxygen flow rate was 20 mL min−1. Real time testing of prepared catalyst was carried out through designing Pd–CeO2 catalyst based membrane electrode assembly using NiCo2O4 catalyst dispersed into a Ni foam for the oxygen reduction reaction cathode catalyst. A peak power density of 25 mW cm−2 at room temperature under ambient conditions was achievable, when open circuit potential of 0.86 V is displayed which is shown in supplementary data (Fig. S6). A single-cell using Pd (20%)-CeO2 (20%)/NMCS anode presented an open circuit potential of 0.86 V and produced current densities of 20 mA cm−2 at 0.5 V and 75 mA cm−2 at 0.33 V. Hence, this study proved catalytic architecture, composition and chemistry shows that Pd and CeO2 are well incorporated. The nanoparticles with uniform dispersion to the robust configuration play a key role towards the enhancement and stability. More significantly, good electronic interactions amid both Pd/CeO2 and the nitrogen support doping enables a major decrease in CO adsorption energy on the surface of the Pd, which is the underpinning energy enhanced CO tolerance mechanism. Following this line, a novel attempt to use tin oxide as a promotor for the electro catalytic activity of core-shell structured Cu@Pd nanoparticles supported on graphene sheets has been examined recently [130]. Tin oxide was supported on graphene maintaining alkaline conditions with varied compositions by pre-determining weight of tin oxide. The graphite composite is calcined at high temperature followed by addition of Cu salt. Under microwave conditions, copper ions are chemically reduced in ethylene glycol as by suspending in a mixture containing palladium chloride, ethylene glycol and sodium citrate with adjusting its pH. XRD of Cup/SnO2/graphite electro catalyst exhibited diverse range of sharp peaks corresponding to different planes at 2θ values of 40.12° (111), 46.32° (200) and 68.06° (220) using JCPDS data of Pd. From SEM studies it is evident that, Pd nanoparticles possesses 24–40 nm, outer SnO2 shell with the dimension of around 28 nm. Cup/SnO2/Graphite electro catalyst of size maximum found to be 32–34 nm. HRTEM image of catalysts exhibited homogenous distribution of synthesized catalyst, which possibly promote efficient catalyst utilization and enhanced electrochemical surface area. CVs of different Cu@Pd/SnO2−Graphite electrocatalysts performed with 0.5 M NaOH solution containing 1 M ethanol that electrocatalytic activity significantly depends upon amount SnO2 promoter. Electro-oxidation current is enhanced with increase in SnO2. An electro catalyst comprising 5 wt % SnO2 displayed the low oxidation peak potential within the studied electro catalysts that is found to be optimal. Based on these studies it is predictable that presence of optimal quantity of tin oxide in the electro catalyst would improve its performance. The homogenous dispersion of small-sized catalyst particles is accountable for observed results that favors presence of more number of electrocatalytically active catalytic centers and promote oxidation reaction rate. The enhanced activity of the as-synthesized core-shell structure is attributed to bi-functional mechanism and ligand effect, wherein presence of tin oxide species in the electrocatalyst structure was adequate to adsorb OHads species that could capably reduce the collected poisoning intermediates over Pd surface. In addition to this, modification in D-band character caused by incorporation of Cu into Pd leads to enhanced activity caused by explicit synergic effect and specific electronic effect. Chronoamperometry established a stable performance of different Cu@Pd/SnO2/Graphite electrocatalysts with decay percentage values of 50.72–72.55% towards ethanol electro-oxidation. From impedance analysis, it is predictable that addition of more quantity of tin oxide is capable of promoting charge-transfer reaction as evidenced by lowered charge transfer resistance. From the Nyquist plot obtained through impedance studies, it is confirmed that incorporation of tin oxide into Cu@Pd/SnO2/Graphite electrocatalyst would competently assist the charge transfer process as illustrated by their lowered impedance values. Outcome of this study substantiated the promotional role of tin oxide for electrocatalytic oxidation of Pd based catalysts."
10,Sonochemical synthesis method,"3.5 Sonochemical synthesis method Synthesis of nanomaterials through high intensity ultrasound depicts a novel route through which no bulk high temperatures, high pressures, or long reaction times are being used [131,132]. Sonochemistry initiates from the transient reactive conditions prompted by ultrasound, which creates exclusive hot spots, these conditions are distinct from other traditional synthetic methods such as photochemistry, wet chemistry, hydrothermal synthesis, etc., [133,134]. Nanostructured noble metals are prepared through sonolysis of the solvent vapor producing strong reductants whereby not additional reducing agents are necessary, the reduction rate is generally very fast and it is possible to obtain very small nanoclusters. Ultrasonication of water produces highly reactive hydrogen and hydroxyl free radicals that are accountable for redox chemistry. As-produced radicals react with organic molecules resulting in the formation of secondary radicals that are able to promote reduction reaction. Ultrasonic synthesis provides an easy way of processing materials by power injection into a chemical system by means of acoustic cavitation from bubble formation, growth and implosive collapse within a fluid. There are very reports available that dealt with synthesis of Pd core-shell nanostructure for alcohol oxidation through sonochemical methods. Mizukoshi et al., has prepared Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticle through reduction of sodium tetrachloroaurate (III) dihydrate and sodium tetrachloropalladate (II) salts by ultrasound irradiation with sodium dodecyl sulfate [135]. Sodium dodecyl sulfate unusually improved the reduction rate, possibly owing to the thermal decomposition that arises at the interfacial region between cavitation bubbles and bulk solution. Spherical shaped core-shell structures with average diameter of 8 nm are visible in the TEM image and they are distributed uniformly. During sonochemical reaction process, absorption spectrum of sonochemical transformation is followed using UV–visible spectra. The interaction between Au and Pd is confirmed from the intensity and wavelength of surface Plasmon absorption band of individual components. Sodium dodecyl sulfate acted stabling agent as well as acted as an effective source of reducing agent for metal ions. Relative concentration of metal ions determines the dimensions of shell and core. TEM images demonstrated the presence of spherically shaped Au@Pd core-shell particles with the mean diameter of 8 nm distributed narrowly with their surfaces of smooth structure. The diameter of the Au core and the thickness of the Pd shell is determined as 6.5 nm and 0.7 nm respectively when molar ratio is maintained as 1:1 as evident from HRTEM images. Followed by this, same authors have prepared and investigated comparatively the core-shell nanostructures fabricated through sonochemical and radiochemical processes [136]. It was predicted that formation of a core-shell structure can be affected by the physical effects of ultrasound, such as effective stirring, microjet stream, or shock wave during the collapse of a cavitation bubble. Possible first ever attempt to synthesize Au–Pd core shell nanoparticles has been endeavored successfully by Zheng et al. [137], through step-by-step sonochemical reduction of Au(III) and Pd(II) ions. The as-prepared catalyst is used to study methanol electro-oxidation reaction. Pd@Pt core-shell nanostructure was prepared using sequential sonochemical reduction reaction whereby Pd core is formed initially, in the step Pt shell is developed. Superior oxygen reduction activity is observed with acidic solution comprising 0.5 M methanol, as compared to commercial Pt/C. Preferentially oriented Pd layer grown with unique core-shell morphology and favorable electronic interaction between Pt and Pd are central for observed results. Alternately, a novel approach through radiolysis is employed to obtain porous Pd surrounded Au bimetallic nanoparticles with the use of soft templates that produce hexagonal mesophases [138]. Surfactant monophasic template is demonstrated to be beneficial as functional materials to synthesize nanostructure particles. Electrodeposition of porous bulk metallic thin films is shown to be achievable using hexagonal liquid crystalline medium as a template which is constituted by water, nonionic surfactant and metal precursor. The synthesized electrocatalyst possesses superior activity towards ethanol oxidation along with stable electrochemical response proving its durability. Typical cyclizing behavior of the catalyst in a mixture of 1 M NaOH/1 M ethanol developed two anodic peaks that corresponds to oxidation of ethanol and in the cathodic sweep oxidation of the EOR intermediates, generated anodic oxidation. Origin of these set of peaks confirmed the prepared catalyst consist of Ni core surrounded by a Pd shell (the active site of EOR catalysis). Eon associated ethanol oxidation reaction is determined to begin from −0.35 V (vs Hg/HgO). The electrochemical characterization showed that prepared catalyst sample has good electrocatalytic efficiency and good stability over time. To obtain Pd@Au core-shell nanostructure, mesophasic reaction medium is established using cetyl ammonium bromide as a surfactant and pentanol acted as a co-surfactant cyclohexane is used as disintegrating agent. Pd and Au metal precursors namely tetraaminepalladium (II) and ethylene and diamine gold (III) are used as a source to from Pd@Au. Apart from aforementioned methods, novel emerging trends are being explored to synthesize Pd based core-shell nanostructures of which, interestingly biosynthesized Au–Pd nanoparticles are fabricated using bio-synthetic strategy [139]. Biosynthetic methods are cheaper and more eco-friendly than physicochemical synthesis method. In brief, biosynthetic methods are inexpensive, doesn't involve toxic chemicals usage and capable of easy modification with good scalability. A facile and an efficient operation is some of the main features of biosynthesis processes. The processing time, depending on the type of bio resource utilized, it varies from a couple of minutes to a couple of days. The documents on the synthesis of hybrid nanoparticles using fungi are somewhat limited, particularly on fungal-mediated synthesis or biocompatibility studies of subsequent hybrid/core shell nanoparticles, apparently due to the reliance on expensive cell cultures and the longer synthesis time often required. The insertion of gene sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana phytochelatin synthase to a plamid vector of a bacterium is found to be usefulfor a biosynthetic process. The prepared catalyst exhibited homogeneous morphology as revealed by TEM images, with the size of about 266 nm. It has been claimed that owing to fascinating properties in combination with synergic effect among components, these core-shell catalyst is desirable for electrocatalytic applications."
11,Direct Formic acid fuel cells,"Renewable energy sources are continuously researched, necessitating the development of new vectors for storing and delivering energy in a reliable and environmentally sustainable manner. Because of their high energy density and relative ease of storage and transportation, chemical fuels are desirable energy storage devices. Direct Formic acid Fuel cells (DFFC) are subcategory of proton-exchange that is also classified as DAFC holds good potential for portable power generation. Formic acid, a common organic acid generated by naturally through bacterial/insect decomposition is used as a fuel. Formic acid can be generated in a sustainable manner through CO2 electroreduction. Since the formic acid market is already saturated, new applications are needed to justify additional production capacity. Fuel cell innovations have an opportunity to broaden it while still ensuring the energy sector's long-term sustainability [140]. Tiny, portable electronics like phones and notebook computers, as well as larger fixed power applications and automobiles, are among their applications. Because of their small fuel crossover feature and high power densities at low temperatures, many researchers believe that DFFCs have the potential to become portable electronics in the not-too-distant future. In general, DLFCs are simpler to treat, store, and transport than H2-fed fuel cells. The most popular liquid fuels are alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol. Methanol has a high energy density, but it is poisonous and has a high fuel crossover rate at high concentrations. Since ethanol is a slow oxidizer, it takes a long time for it to decompose. In comparison to other liquid fuel cells that operate on methanol (1.21 V) or ethanol (1.14 V), DFFCs have a higher theoretical cell voltage (1.45 V with oxygen as the oxidant). As compared to alternative choices, formic acid is a promising fuel for DLFC because of lower fuel crossover, higher theoretical cell potential and power densities, and faster oxidation kinetics [141,142]. Towards the end we aimed to include discussions of core-shell based electrocatalysis for this unique kind of fuel cell. Operation of Pd, Rh and Au electrodes for electro-oxidation of formic acid is widely studied [143]. The dual path formic acid oxidation reaction mechanism on Pt is a generally accepted mechanism that encompasses a reactive intermediate formed via a main dehydrogenation path and adsorbed CO (poisoning species) formed via a parallel dehydrogenation path. The adsorption of the intermediate CO slows down the process. Furthermore, the high cost and availability of Pt are a barrier to the commercialization of DFFCs. Three possible reaction paths of formic acid oxidation have been proposed. (11) HCOOH* → COOH* + e− → CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− (12) HCOOH* → HCOO +H+ +e− → CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− (13) HCOOH* → CO* + H2O → CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− Here, * denotes an adsorbed state. From the above steps, it is evident that first step involves removal of the first hydrogen atom. CO2 is formed during second step dehydrogenation that is refereed as formate pathway. But final step involves indirect path wherein adsorbed CO is generated through non-Faradaic dehydration, which is further oxidized to carbon dioxide. Extensive attempts have been made to improve the oxidation rate of formic acid on Pt catalysts by alloying Pt with other metals in order to achieve the goals of increased activity and lower cost [144]. Pd is suggested for catalysis but is more vulnerable to oxidation than Pt, also the stability of Pd catalysts is questioned. Pd has good formic acid oxidation activity than Pt or Pt/Pd catalyst, but the steady-state activities are Pt/Pd > Pd > Pt [145]. The authors has found that open cell potential depends significantly on the catalyst composition, the open cell potential of the Pt/Pd catalyst is 0.91 V, compared to 0.71 V for pure Pt and 0.59 V for Pt/Ru, when tested in DFFC comprising Pt as cathode with 5 M formic acid at supplied at flow rate 0.2 ml min−1 at 30o C. At a cell potential of 0.5 V, the maximum current is 62 mA cm−2 with Pt/Pd vs. 33 mA cm−2 with pure Pt/Ru when polarization studies performed. Pt/Ru has 38 mA cm−2 and Pt has 38 mA cm−2. Surprisingly, the Pt/Ru catalyst produces the most porosity. The modified Pd–Ni2P/C anode electrocatalyst with remarkable catalytic efficiency with stable activity is tested DFFC and it is proven to be better hybrid catalyst with reasonably good power density and discharge stability, superior to several state-of-the-art catalysts [146]. The steady-state polarization was performed at the flow rate of formic acid was 200 mL min−1 and the flow rate of O2 was 500 mL min−1 at 30o C, power-density curves of catalysts were compared. Polarization results reveal that Pd–Ni2P/C-30% catalyst exhibits the highest power density which is about two-fold higher than that of PdNi/C, 3 fold higher than that of PdP/C, and 3.5 fold higher than that of a Pd/C commercial catalyst. Among all prepared catalysts, Pd–Ni2P/C-30% shows the best performance for formic acid oxidation with maximum peak power density of 550 mW cm−2. Also, surface poising of Pd catalyst has been mitigated by incorporation of many additives into Pd nanostructure such as cobalt phosphide [147], iron phosphide [148], europium oxide [149], cerium oxide [150], oxyhydroxides [151], molybdenum oxide [152], thermal annealed iron phosphide [153], samarium oxide modified carbon [154] as catalyst promoting materials for boosting catalytic activity. Feng et al., has extensively studied developing Pd based electrocatalyst for DAFCs and reviewed the use of transition-metal phosphides as durable and efficient catalyst materials recently due to their excellent catalytic properties [155]. Continuing along this context, in recent times, the Pd based catalysts have shown improved performance towards formic acid electro-oxidation by incapacitating the CO adsorption effect [156]. Hence, we have endeavored to explore the significance of PCA based electrocatalysis for DFFCs. Being attracted by core-shell or hollow metal nanostructures widespread interest is shown to design electro catalyst of core-shell morphology with distinguished chemical and physical properties. Besides, core-shell configuration help to cut down the catalyst cost. Diverse synthetic methods have been followed of which electrodeposition, chemical reduction, hydrothermal synthesis are discussed here. A theoretical insight into the formic acid dehydrogenation steps on Pd–Co@Pd core-shell is attempted recently, that describes the decomposing steps of formic acid over three different Pd-based core-shell catalysts as well as on pure Pd (111) surface [157]. It is suggested that the most encouraging dehydrogenation pathways are the COOH-mediated rather HCOO-mediated mechanism occurred on Pd (111). All spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out with the Vienna ab-initio simulation package by authors to analyze PdxCoy bimetallic model. It is to noted that six different kinds of adsorption sites are proposed for PdxCoy@Pd(111) catalyst surface. The energy of adsorption and favored sites of formic acid, potential reaction intermediates and corresponding products on PdxCoy@Pd (111) and Pd (111) catalyst surface are investigated. Both the trans and cis form of formic acid isomers specifically tend to adsorb at upper site on PdCo@Pd (111) by carboxyl oxygen. They found that adsorption structures of formate (HCOO) are bidentate and monodentate binding sites. As illustrated in this report, carboxyl group binds to the surface through the carbon end to form two adsorption structures: cis and trans, with trans-COOH being more stable. CO and H adsorb strongly at CO2 and H2O physically adsorb at the bridge and top sites, but not at the fcc-Pd site correspondingly. Based on the studies three different pathways for formic acid elector-oxidation is suggested as follows [157]: (14) Path I: trans-HCOOH → bi-HCOO+H → CO2(g)+2H (15) Path II: trans-HCOOH → bi-HCOO+H → mono-HCOO+H → CO2(g)+2H (16) Path III: trans-HCOOH → trans-COOH→ CO2(g)+2H As proposed above, for the HCOO-mediated reaction pathways I and II, the more facile pathway is Path I on Pd1Co3@Pd (111), Pd3Co1@Pd (111) and Pd (111), but over PdCo@Pd (111) surface Path II is predominant. Studies revealed that 1.34, 1.18, and 1.34 are the powerful free energy barriers. Free energy barriers from Pd (111) to Pd1Co3@Pd (111) tend to decrease steadily, with the values of 0.90, 0.96, 1.16 and 1.31 eV respectively. In other words, the dehydrogenation activity decreased when amount of Co in Pd–Co alloy is increased. Pd(111) > Pd3Co1@Pd(111)>PdCo@Pd(111)>Pd1Co3@Pd(111). These findings indicate that the dehydrogenation behavior of PdxCoy@Pd is highly affected by the core element composition, which can be due to alloying effects caused by the addition of Co to Pd. The alloying effect is the product of a combination of factors involving strain and ligand effects. DFT calculations show that a suitable Co composition in the Pd–Co core is crucial for tuning the catalytic efficiency, providing a theoretical guideline for developing high-performance bimetallic core-shell catalysts for other dehydrogenation reactions. The energetic spans for the complete catalytic cycle were determined by locating the dehydrogenation pathways via HCOO and COOH intermediates, as well as the dehydration pathways via HCOO, COOH, and HCO intermediates are monitored. PdCo@Pd(111) has the best catalytic efficiency, with a Pd:Co atomic ratio of 1:1. This study has implications for the rational design of more active and/or cost-effective core-shell catalysts, including the following: Pd–Ni@Pd or Pd–Cu@Pd core-shell catalysts for the dehydrogenation of formic acid, by controlling the atomic ratio of alloys in the core, which can also be added to the surface-design of novel heterogeneous catalyst. Diverse metals such as Cu, Au, Co, Ni, Ag, Al have been used as core with outer Pd shell core-shell structures are developed to investigate effect of the core metal on the shell Pd catalytic performance theoretically using microkinetic modeling [158]. The Ag@Pd catalyst, in particular, not only has the highest activity and selectivity for CO2 generation, but it also has the lowest CO adsorption efficiency, preventing CO poisoning and lowering noble Pd use. The electronic properties of the average Bader charge and D-band center corresponding to the shell Pd are investigated to determine the function of the core metal form in modifying the shell Pd catalytic performance."
12,electrodeposition and galvanic displacement method,"4.1 electrodeposition and galvanic displacement method Later, a galvanic displacement reaction with Ag nanorods at 100 °C (PdAg-100) and room temperature was used to create nanoneedle-covered palladium-silver nanotubes (PdAg-25) was examined by Lu et al., [159]. The synthesized PdAg nanotubes have a hollow structure with a nanoneedle-covered surface, which provides the ideal large surface area for catalytic reagents, according to transmission and scanning electron microscopic measurements. This research focused on the use of nanoneedle-covered PdAg nanotubes with high surface areas as anode electrocatalysts in fuel cells, as well as the effect of surface structure on their catalytic activity. From impedance studies, it is confirmed that facile electron transfer with low charge-transfer resistance is possible over the PdAg-100 nanorods compared to that of the PdAg-25 nanorods, indicating the electron-transfer kinetics for formic acid oxidation at the PdAg-100 nanorods is much well facilitated. Likewise, the raspberry hollow Pd nanospheres-surrounded carbon nanotube for electro-oxidation of methanol, ethanol, and formic acid in alkaline media was also developed [160]. A replacement reaction between sacrificial cobalt nanoparticles and PtCl6, Pd2+ ions deposited over carbon nanotubes supported PtPd hollow nanospheres. Later by galvanic method, Cu has been replaced with Pd on hollow Au nanosphere [161]. Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles have been developed. The grain size of the polycrystalline hollow Au nanospheres was reduced as the concentration of the Au solution was reduced, and the structures became highly porous. The formic acid oxidation activity of Au@Pd nanoparticles synthesized with reduced Au concentrations was higher (0.93 mA cm−2at 0.3 V) than commercial Pd black (0.85 mA cm−2 at 0.3 V), indicating that they could be useful as fuel cell catalysts. In addition, compared to Pd black, the Au@Pd nanoparticles had a lower CO-stripping capacity, better stability, and longer durability. A pulse electrodeposition process is used to create a novel core-shell structured AuPt@Pd/C catalyst for the electrooxidation of formic acid, and the AuPt core nanoparticles are obtained using sodium borohydride reduction method [162]. The increase in particle size caused by a Pd layer covering the AuPt nucleus, as well as a negative change in the CO stripping peak, show the catalyst's core-shell structure. A small quantity of Pt increases Au dispersion, resulting in smaller core particles. The as-prepared catalyst displayed excellent activity towards formic acid oxidation, with mass activities of 4.4 A mg−1 Pd and 0.83 A mg−1 metal, respectively, which are 8.5 and 1.6 times those of commercial Pd/C. A novel method for synthesizing Pd/PdCo core-shell nanoparticles with improved catalytic activity and longevity for formic acid electro-oxidation is also studied [163]. Since Pd has a higher nucleation rate than Co, it was used to shape the core in the early stages of phase potential electrodeposition, and then the co-electrodeposition of Pd and Co resulted in the creation of a thin Pd–Co shell. Formic acid electro-oxidation with the use of Pd@PdCo core-shell particle yielded a mass activity of 1580 mA mg−1 Pd as the peak current response. Authors have demonstrated a method for synthesizing Pd@PdCo core-shell particles with a shell thickness of about 2 nm by addressing the kinetics of nucleation during electrodeposition. Besides, synthesis of carbon-supported Cu@Pd catalysts is achieved by a galvanic replacement reaction to be utilized in the electro catalytic oxidation of formic acid is reported by Ren et al. [164], based on the strategy which sightsees the correlation among lattice strain, electronic structure, and catalytic performance. The authors have studied in detail about bimetallic/trimetallic catalyst with compositional diversity that provides a quantity of openings to regulate the properties of an electrocatalyst with consequential performance enhancements, such as operation of catalytic activity and stability operating by geometrical or ligand effects. The presence of Cu in the nanocatalyst increases lattice strain and marks in a downshift of the D-band of Pd as demonstrated by spectroscopic analyses. Also, it has been proven that feebler adsorption strength for CO with enriched Cu content, which can be ascribed to the downshift of the electronic d-band and demonstrated that Cu:Pd atomic ratio of 27:73 is optimal for highest activity to oxidize formic acid. This work throws light on dependence of lattice strain increase with the lattice contraction in the crystal and its connection to the electronic configuration and catalytic performance for formic acid oxidation. Morphologies of the as-prepared Pd/C and Cu@Pd/C were determined to be 3.8 nm and 3.9–4.0 nm respectively. XRD studies indicate that a set of characteristic reflections corresponding to Pd-face centered cubic observed for all prepared catalysts with planes indexed at (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222), demonstrating that catalysts are single-phase disordered Pd face-centered-cubic structured. In addition, it is found that as relative to reflections in as-prepared Pd/C, the Cu@Pd/C catalysts' diffraction peaks change to higher 2θ with rising Cu content. The relationship between lattice strain, electronic structure, and catalytic efficiency is revealed by a peak-like plot between behavior and atomic composition as evidenced by CV studies. ECSA of all as-synthesized catalysts were measured both through H2 adsorption/desorption and CO stripping methods. Cu27@Pd73/C catalyst exhibit highest ECSA of 12.33 m2 g−1, with maximum formic acid electro-oxidation activity. Assuming that COad is produced inexorably formed during the electro-oxidation of formic acid and will almost certainly poison Pd-based catalysts, the increased resistance to COad is more important, anti-poisoning effect caused by the presence of Cu at optimal level is useful, as evidenced by this study. When tested in a half-cell, conducted at 50 mV s−1 in 0.5 M sulphuric acid/0.5 M formic acid current density for formic acid oxidation on the catalysts varies with atomic compositions of the catalysts in the order Cu27@Pd73/C > Cu21@Pd79/C > Cu15@Pd85/C > Pd/C > Cu35@Pd65/C > Cu44@Pd56/C, demonstrating enhanced formic acid catalytic activity attributable to a synergistic effect of copper atoms. The results are as provided by Fig.S6. It is demonstrated that efficiency of the Cu@Pd/C system is clearly affected by the lattice strain associated with lattice contraction as well as the formation of the core-shell structure. The tuning of the reactive species adsorption shift may be a key component of the peak-like profile as observed in Fig. S7. (Traces a, b, c, d, e, and f are corresponding to the Pd/C, Cu15@Pd85/C, Cu21@Pd79/C, Cu27@Pd73/C, Cu35@Pd65/C, and Cu44@Pd56/C catalysts). The obtained results are verified further by chroammperometry, the highest initial current density is displayed by Cu27@Pd73/C catalyst. The initial current densities at 0.16 V has decreased in the order Cu27@Pd73/C > Cu21@Pd79/C > Cu15@Pd85/C > Cu35@Pd65/C > Pd/C > Cu44@Pd56/C. The results of chroammperometry are provided in Fig. S7. The results are corroborated with XRD outcomes, which prove that lattice contraction increases with addition of Cu and results in lattice strain accompanying with surface Pd atoms, which influences the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts. An excessive increase in Cu, on the other hand, would result in a decrease in catalytic activity and an increase in durability, as demonstrated by the Cu35@Pd65/C and Cu44@Pd56/C catalysts. Alternately, Ag nanowires are synthesized as templates using a polyol reduction method [165] followed by Pd thin layer coating by sequential reduction go together with the galvanic displacement. Ag@Pd component will greatly increase the electrocatalytic activity for the electro-oxidation of formic acid while also improving the Pd component's stability. The improved electrocatalytic activity and durability are thought to be due to the increased ESCA area and modulated electron structure of Pd caused by Ag. Huang et al. , has developed a novel catalyst tremed as Pd@Ag alloy nanotubes through galvanic displacement method [166]. In this work, the authors have attempted to fine-tune catalytic performance of alloy nanomaterials through the electrochemical dissolution of the more active component from alloy nanomaterials. TEM and SEM analysis of the as-synthesized Ag nanowires and Ag@Pd nanostructure with different magnifications had diameters of nearly 80 ± 5 nm and lengths of longer than 5 μm. HRTEM analysis of Ag@Pd nanotubes performed at different positions, HRTEM image is as shown in Fig. S8. It is evident that Ag@Pd nanotubes had a hollow morphology with a thin layer of Pd. Further measurements indicated that the shell area comprised largely one type of lattice fringe with an inter-planar spacing of 2.24 Å, which was due to the Pd (111). The inner Ag lattice spacing estimated between the two closest atom rows was 2.32 Å. Through galvanic replacement of preformed Cu on hollow Au cores with different PdCl2 concentrations, distinctive morphology-tunable Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles were synthesized [167]. The structure of the nanocrystalline Pd on the hollow Au core surface was found to be highly affected by the concentration of PdCl2. According to the electrochemical results, the Au@Pd nanoparticles had higher catalytic activity and stability than commercial Pd black. The electrocatalyst made with 2.5 mM PdCl2 in particular have excellent catalytic properties, due to the best possible electronic coupling between the Pd shells and Au core. Furthermore, the observed electronic property shift is followed by an increase in the number of Pd (100) facets on the surface of the hollow Au cores. As a result, the Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles formed exhibit high electrochemical performance, making them attractive electrocatalysts for DFAFC implementations. Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles outperformed commercial Pd black in terms of electrochemical efficiency and stability in formic acid oxidation, especially those made with 2.5 mM PdCl2. The optimal electronic coupling effect induced by the interface between the unique Pd structure and the hollow Au core may explain the improved electrocatalytic efficiency."
13,Chemical reduction,"4.2 Chemical reduction Zhou et al., investigated a core-shell structured Au@Pd catalyst and discovered that the interaction between the Pd shell and the Au core greatly improved the catalytic performance of Pd for formic acid oxidation [168]. CO-stripping voltammograms of performed with prepared catalyst samples (Au/C, Pd/C and Au@Pd/C) prove that the most prominent change between CO-stripping on Pd/C and on Au@Pd/C was the negative shift of the CO oxidation peak with Au@Pd/C. When compared to Pd/C, the onset of COads oxidation on Au@Pd/C was shifted negatively by about 100 mV, and the peak potential was moved negatively by about 45 mV. This suggests that the core-shell structure aided in the weakening of the CO adsorptive bond on Pd active sites via interaction between the Pd shell and the Au core. Also, ECSA measured by the integrated CO-oxidation peak areas were 62.8 m2 g−1 Pd for Pd/C and 55.8 m2 g−1 for Au@Pd/C catalysts. The observed results are explained of the on the basis of improved activity formic acid electro-oxidation correlated to the core-shell structure mainly the interface between the Au core and the Pd shell. Pt sub-monolayer surrounded gold nanorods are utilized for formic acid oxidation and it was found this catalyst's activity is higher to commercial Pt/C catalyst [169]. In this line, Ge et al., examined the Pd hollow nanosphere catalyst and organized the particle size by adjusting the experimental pH value [170]. A simple method to prepare polypyrrole-modified Vulcan XC-72 carbon-supported Pd/PPy-Vulcan-XC-72 hollow nanosphere catalyst was investigated by Bai et al., [171]. The catalysts comprising 40 and 20% Pd had a large ECSA and a strong increase in electrocatalytic activity against formic acid oxidation, making them ideal for DAFC. A two-step technique was used to boost the catalyst's stability and utilization ratio, which included the incorporation of a polypyrrole carbon composite and the preparation of a hollow nanosphere catalyst. Chemical reduction was used to deposit Co nanoparticles as sacrificial templates on the prepared polypyrrole carbon composites, and then Pd hollow nanospheres were formed through the surface. Similarly, sequential reduction of Au–Pd metal precursors to prepare carbon supported Au@Pd core-shell catalyst is also attempted and successfully demonstrated for electro-oxidation of formic acid [172]. The interaction between the Pd shell and the Au core is credited with increasing activity. CV and CA studies indicated that the core-shell structure could greatly increase the catalytic action and stability of Pd in the room temperature electro-oxidation of formic acid. Pure Au sample supported on carbon exhibited less activity in the electro-oxidation of formic acid and CO. This enhancement is credited with increasing activity. Alternately, a colloidal method with a small amount of Pt as core is used to make a Pd decorated Pt/C catalyst, Pt@Pd/C [173]. The as-prepared catalyst is found to have excellent activity in the anodic oxidation of formic acid at room temperature, with a 60% higher activity than Pd/C. Active components are distributed very well and particle sizes are smaller due to the use of Pt as a center. Because of their high surface area, supported PtPd hollow nanospheres have excellent electrochemical properties for the electrooxidation of formic acid (high electrocatalytic activity and excellent stability [174]. Followed by this, Gao et al., has investigated on core-shell structured Ru@PtxPdy electrocatalysts with PtxPdy as shell and nano-sized Ru as core. A successive reduction technique was used to prepare this catalyst [175]. Ru@PtxPdy/formic acid oxidation behavior varies with the Pt: Pd atomic ratio. When compared to Pd/C, the peak oxidation capacity of Ru@Pt1Pd2/C changes negatively by around 200 mV. The higher electro-catalytic activity for formic acid oxidation on Ru@PtxPdy/C with a core-shell structure catalyst than that on PtxPdy/C proposes the high utilization of noble metals. As well as the enriched noble metal utilization, Ru@PtxPdy/C catalyst also shows improved stability as evidenced by chronoamperometric evaluations. Ultra-small Ag@Pd/C core-shell nanocrystals with superior electrocatalytic activity for DAFC application is also studied [176]. Using formaldehyde and ethylene glycol as reducing agents, ultra-small Ag@Pd core-shell nanocrystals supported over Vulcan-XC72R carbon with different Ag@Pd atomic ratios are synthesized. The size distribution of Ag@Pd core-shell nanocrystals is narrow, with an average size of 4.3 nm. The as-synthesized Ag@Pd core-shell nanocrystals show outstanding electrocatalytic activities for formic acid oxidation, which may be due to high Pd use resulting from the formation of Ag@Pd core-shell nanostructure. Later, Au@Pd of diverse shapes cubic, cuboctahedric and octahedral are investigated to analyze surface electronic effects on formic acid oxidation, it is evidenced that octahedron shaped Au@Pd presents enhanced affinity for the CO adsorption-desorption routes that favors indirect oxidation path but cubic shaped Au@Pd facilitates direct route [177]. Alternately, Ag@Pd core-shell nanoparticles at different ratios were prepared by successive sequential reductions using ethylene glycol as reducing agent under N2 atmosphere and studied as an electro catalyst for formic acid oxidation [178]. The terrace sites in the Pd shell are electronically promoted by the Ag core, resulting in dramatically improved catalytic properties. To shape controlled AuPd@Pd core-shell nanocrystal catalyst, single pot co-reduction of metal salts in presence of a structure directing agent is employed by Liu et al. [179]. The as-prepared catalysts exhibited higher catalytic performance towards both the formic acid and glycerol oxidation reactions in alkaline media as compared to commercial Pd/C. Another study targeted to correlate influence of the surface chemistry of carbon on the electrochemical behavior of Pd and Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles prepared through colloidal methods [180]. The electrocatalytic activity of the carbon support was highly dependent on the method of preparation. When impregnated Pd nanoparticles were supported on the highly oxidized Vulcan carbon support, they displayed higher formic acid oxidation current values. As a result of the high density of oxygenated functional groups, smaller particle sizes (2.3 nm) are produced. In the view of improving the catalytic performance a new ternary core-shell comprising Au core covered by Pd shell decorated with Pt nanoclusters has been developed and evaluated for electro-oxidation of formic acid through seed-mediated growth [181]. The shell thickness and cluster coverage in this method was easily organized through adjusting the molar ratios of the second and third metal ions to Au seeds in solution. The extremely high electro-oxidation activity is most likely due to synergistic morphological and electronic effects at the mixed hollow D-sites, when surface Pt coverage was optimal. The combination of electrochemical, spectroscopic, and DFT studies reported in this section demonstrate that our trimetallic nanostructure has electronic properties and a surface morphology that make it suitable for catalysis. The high catalytic activity of Au@Pd@Pt nanoparticle with just two atomic layers of Pd and a submonolayer quantity of Pt demonstrated in this report make them a promising new electrode material for commercial fuel cells. Furthermore, the Au core may be substituted with Ag, which is structurally similar but much cheaper, to achieve increased catalytic activity through the same synergistic effect. There is a persistent necessity to progress new materials for environmentally friendly processes as part of the drive to develop a more sustainable energy materials. Developing low-level metal loading anode catalysts with better electrocatalytic activity for liquid fuel cells is still a difficult task. In recent times, different shaped (cubic, cuboctahedric and octahedral shapes) Au@Pd core-shell electrocatalysts were synthesized with the aim of investigating electronic effects of these nanostructures on the formic acid oxidation reaction by surfactant-assisted chemical reduction [182]. Three diffrent Au@Pd core-shell nanostructures were obtained by controlling ratio volumes 0.21/0.79, 0.32/0.68, and 0.37/0.63 of Au/Pd metal salts allowed obtaining the cubic, cuboctahedral and octahedral nanostructures, respectively. From SEM studies, edge dimensions of Au@Pd(cubic), Au@Pd (cuboctahedral) and Au@Pd(octahedral) are determined to be 25.86 ± 1.8 nm, 25.35 ± 1.6 nm and 26.28 ± 2.0 nm respectively. Likewise, their outer-shell thickness (Pd layer) is measured as 47.33 ± 3.8 nm, 43.74 ± 4.6 nm and 48.36 ± 6.8 nm respectively. ECSA measured through CO stripping voltammogram of as-formed Au@Pd nanostructures in nitrogen-saturated 0.05 M perchloric acid solution is found to be 39 m2 g −1, 95 m2 g −1 and 121 m2 g −1 for cubic, cuboctahedral and octahedral morphologies respectively. LSV studies performed in 1 M percholoric acid/1 M formic acid solution revealed that the cubic shape showed the lowest anodic Tafel slope and it presents relatively fast kinetics. The charge transfer coefficients is higher for cubic shape compared to others. Steady-state current density measured at 0.6 V by chromammperomtry at 1600 s is 0.159 mA cm−2, 0.134 mA cm−2 and 0.115 mA cm−2 respectively for cubic, cuboctahedral and octahedral shapes respectively. The octahedral nanostructure displayed the lowest steady-state current density because of predominance of indirect oxidation mechanism. Outcome of this report concluded that the D-band centers were directed by the first moment integrate of DOS and the D-band center shift among the different nanostructures were of 0.02 eV. This shape-dependent electrocatalytic performance is verified for core-shell nanostructures. Direct formic acid oxidation mechanism is favored by cubic morphology but indirect route is predominantly occurring in octahedral shape because the CO adsorption-desorption processes occur preferably on this nanostructure. The order of cuboctahedral > cubic > octahedral for the Pd surface and Au@Pd volume per nanostructure is: cuboctahedral > cubic > octahedral. Since these morphologic parameters influence the D-band center capacity, the cubic nanostructure was found to be the most efficient, and its electrocatalytic behavior in the formic acid oxidation was altered in both directions."
14,Hydrothermal and microwave syntheses,"4.3 Hydrothermal and microwave syntheses Recently, highly efficient CuPd@Pd core-shell tetrahedra with concave and Pd-enriched surface catalyst is prepared by one-pot hydrothermal synthetic strategy [183], using L-Proline as structure directing agent. This bimetallic concave structure can endow nanocrystals with a large number of catalytically active sites as well as interesting electronic effects, both of which are thought to be beneficial for electrocatalysis. Both mass specific and area-specific activities of CuPd@Pd core-shell tetrahedra are demonstrated to be substantially higher along with good anti-poisoning property. A facile green method is suggested by Wang et al. [184], that relies on direct nucleation and growth of ultrafine and well dispersed Au@Pd core–shell nanoclusters on nitrogen-doped mildly reduced graphene oxide. Two-step process is developed to synthesize Au@Pd/C and Ru@Pd/C core-shell for formic acid oxidation and it is established that Au@Pd exhibits higher activity as compared to Ru@Pd/C core-shell [185]. Despite numerous studies on the synthesis of regulated metallic nanomaterials, widespread catalytic applications are limited due to the difficulties in mass-producing them while retaining reasonable uniformity and precise physicochemical control. To progress further in the field, we believe that a more accurate understanding of the forming processes and kinetics combining the galvanic replacement reaction and co-reduction is necessary. Table 1 represents our consolidated results synthetic methods for fabricating core-shell structured fuel cell electrocatalyst along with merits and demerits of each preparative method. The core-shell nanostructures are ideal for electrocatalysis because of their greatly enhanced synergic properties, which are mostly due to the strain and ligand impact introduced by the presence of a surrounding medium over the core, resulting in a wide range of nanomaterials for electro catalysis. Notwithstanding these challenges, the simplicity of the processing approach for the synthesis of homogeneous and consistent nanoparticles is one of the more challenging aspects of this special class of materials. In reality, scaling-up is the most pressing issue preventing the commercialization of multifunctional nanoparticles. Analogously, gaining a better understanding of particle nucleation and growth will allow us to better monitor and optimize the nanomaterials generated for a specific catalytic application. Since the nucleation and development of colloidal nanocrystals are so susceptible to laboratory conditions, scaling up production by merely growing the reaction volume is extremely difficult."
15,Real time fuel cell performance: single cell testing,"It is clear that the electroctalytic performance is well-proved when tested in real fuel cell mode, proper performance of a single cell is closely related to many factors therefore, a study of improved control alternatives is fully justified [186]. There is also a lack of consistent and systematic studies into the use of controlled nanomaterials in heterogeneous catalysis to explain whether and how both electronic and geometric parameters must be controlled to obtain the optimal outputs. This is essential in order to develop a design theory for the synthesis of high-performance nanocatalysts. This section deals with real cell performance data evaluated for DAFC using PCA as an electrocatalyst. Both fuel oxidation and oxidant reduction occurs at the electrode interface and the rate of these reactions determines the cell voltage. The active metal electrocatalyst is dispersed over high surface area carbon when electrodes are fabricated for constructing membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The prime requirement for an efficient an electro catalyst is high dispersion rate, favorable interaction with supporting carbon material and low-aggregating characteristics [187]. The mass activity of metal core-shell is mainly related to the degree of dispersion, since the reaction rate is generally proportional to its active surface area. Hence choice of a good catalyst support material determines the catalyst structure and functionality. In this regard, significant number of investigations has been carried out in the field of the fuel cell electrocatalysis. Both cost and reliability strongly depend upon electrocatalysts that drive the electrochemical reactions at cathode and anode sides of a fuel cell [188]. Hence developing active electrocatalyst with high turn-over rates of the desired reaction and minimizing the amount of metal catalyst is essential. A distinctive catalyst layer should possess larger catalyst-polymer electrolyte interface, efficient proton transport pathways, proper channels for the easy transport of reactant and product gases and removal of condensed water as well as continuous electrical connectivity between reaction sites and massive current collectors. Best catalyst structure is derived when there is an optimal balance between the above said factors are reached and typical catalyst structure. Therefore, in real cell mode, a triple phase boundary that is formed between catalysts, an ionomer and reactant gas is central rather than two-phase boundary. We have therefore, provided a glimpse of literature accounts that deal with real fuel cell performance studies using PCA electrocatalyst. Ni@Pd/MWCNTs electrocatalysts is shown to exhibit good catalytic activity towards methanol oxidation as well in a single fuel cell set-up [189]. Table 2 provides relevant performance data available in literature for the single-cell performance of an MEA. Pd@C–Ni catalyst when used as anode in direct ethanol fuel cell exhibited a peak power density up to 202 mW cm−2 at 60 °C along with good stability [190]. The single-cell performance of Pd-based electrocatalyst comprising a surface layer of Pt (5 wt%) supported on a core Pd3Co1 alloy (95 wt%) has also been evaluated [191]."
16,Conclusions and outlook,"Developing inexpensive and earth-abundant alternatives to precious-metal-based catalysts for chemical processing is one of the main obstacles in developing a renewable energy future. Core-shell construction is a compelling model for next-generation high-activity, stable and tunable catalysts. Core-shell catalysts are an enticing catalytic research goal attributable to their optimizing oxidation substrate properties, such as selectivity, operation, and chemical/physical stability. The direct synthesis of core-shell nanocatalyst by a renewable, cost-effective, and scalable method, has attracted a lot of interest in recent years. We may gain insight into a final target of the research by looking back at the history of model core-shell nanostructures of Pd that is absolutely developed for direct alcohol fuel cell electrocatalysis. These unique nanostructures have materialized as valuable and resourceful materials for electro-catalysis because of their additive or complementarily enriched properties compared to their one-component counterparts. The strain and ligand effect in the middle of the core and surrounding shell can be exploited for modifying the catalytic activity and selectivity electrocatalysts. The core-shells are also a way to obtain specific structures and implementations through the combination of component features not available with their single component equivalents. Extensive studies dealt with common tendency of core-shell preferences in transition metals in binary alloy particles using the density functional theory and it is inferred that two predominant factors namely the cohesive energy and the Wigner-Seitz radius determine synergistic effect operating between core-shell component is responsible for unique properties. While none of the catalysts for the targeted six-electron oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide have been reported in these three case studies, some key design concepts to this end may be deduced. The case studies on molecular electro catalysts for alcohol oxidation presented here provide a succinct overview of the topical category of this important, but underdeveloped, research area. Reaction mechanism of ethylene glycol and glycerol are complicated than methanol and ethanol oxidation. There are several superficial similarities across these systems which disclose interesting insights into key catalyst properties and further optimization parameters. Reaction conditions such as pH of solution, temperature and potential applied play a vital role for determining nature of the product as well as mechanism of reaction. Task-specific core-shell nanostructures has opened up a new field of research with principal aim of designing novel class of catalyst assembled by multifunctional nanomaterials that outperform other materials and appropriate for novel applications. Core-shell nanostructures are suitable for electrocatalysis owing to significantly improved synergic properties that stems mainly from strain and ligand effect introduced by the presence of surrounding medium over the core, which offers versatile nanomaterials for electrocatalysis. Number of publications related to synthetic methods and applications of core-shell nanostructure is ever-increasing especially to tailor these materials for electrocatalytic applications. This review pursues to accentuate impact of core-shell nanostructures upon alcohol oxidation reaction, which a prime andic reaction of alcohol-based fuel cells that differentiating into a novel aspect in recent times. Ultimately, this research will continue to make groundbreaking developments for the synthesis, properties, modification and application of this emerging class of nanomaterials. Still a deep understanding about interaction between core shell components is essential in order to fine-tune choice of the materials or metal component and establish a relation of catalyst composition with electro catalytic efficiency. Ultimately, electrocatalyst comprising earth abundant core-shell components are of great interest, tailoring core-shell structure addresses the possibility. Developed catalyst is greatly attractive not only for fuel cells but also for other energy conversion and energy strong devices. In fact, optimizing the composition of the two components will promote selective organic electrocatalytic reaction and provide additional opportunities for chemists. To put it another way, a viewpoint on the advancement of innovations and the difficulties of various synthetic methods to develop model core-shell nanostructures of Pd have been described. Early research focused mostly on determining better reaction conditions and proposing operating principles of underlying synergy between core and shell materials. There is also a lack of consistent and systematic studies into the use of controlled nanomaterials in heterogeneous catalysis to explain whether and how both electronic and geometric parameters must be controlled to obtain the optimal outputs. We have reviewed many kinds of Pd core-shell electrocatlysts and reaction systems capable of achieving high efficiency with good CO tolerance. Notably, however, the commercialization (scale up) of direct alcohol fuel cells is still afflicted by difficulties, owing to the absence of a perfect solver, coined a “dream-performing” catalyst, capable of overcoming the majority of the problems arising due to electrocatalysis, such as low conversion/turnover, poor CO tolerance and so on. To get one step closer to the target, this review focuses on studies that address i) targeted nanocatalyst syntheses ii) design functionally-good core-shell structures iii) advanced synthetic methods iv) statistical modelling and v) novel approaches to manipulate structure-property relationship and vi) emerging novel cost effective core-shell structures vii) providing guideline to emerge novel catalyst design viii) DFT calculation for ensuring catalyst design strategy ix) establishing relationship between catalysis and surface. Therefore, electrocatalysts ranging from a palladium core-shell nanostructure, were described and evaluated, their catalysis mechanisms explained, and their activities assessed. Besides, single cell fuel cell performance data wherever available has been discussed that provides a clear outlook on scientifically sound approach to fabricate core-shell nanostructured electrocatalyst. Nonetheless, one of the many difficult features of this specific class of materials is the versatility of the processing method for the development of homogeneous and consistent nanoparticles. In fact, scaling-up is the most critical problem for the potential development of multifunctional nanoparticles in industrial quantities. Recent developments in the preparation of Pd based core-shell nano electro catalyst and their catalytic and electro catalytic applications have been summarized in this review article. This review provided an outlook about diverse synthetic methods followed to obtain Pd core-shell nanostructure that have been used for the preparation a wide range of nanostructured electro catalysts for electro-oxidation of alcohol with the aim of utilizing them for direct alcohol fuel cells. We should break down the traditional means of enhancing catalytic operation to the use of efficient and feasible methodologies as the above-mentioned scientific advances (i.e. synthetic approaches, analyses, and numerical calculations) become increasingly achieved. The concepts discussed here include concrete guidance for readers who want to create excellent catalysts, not just for their own use, but for other technological applications also. Such developments in core-shell nanocatalysis are expected to provide a strong and reliable ground for the design of heterogeneous catalysis, green chemistry, and ecologically sustainable protocols in the foreseeable future."
