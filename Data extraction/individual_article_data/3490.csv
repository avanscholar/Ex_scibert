0,Introduction,"Hydrogels are network of hydrophilic polymers with three-dimensional structure. They can absorb large amount of water and swell without undergoing dissolution or loss of structural integrity [1]. The water absorption is facilitated by hydrophilic functional groups and dissolution resistance is conferred by crosslinking between polymer chains. Hydrogels respond (shrink or expand) to their external environmental conditions (physical or chemical stimuli) such as temperature, light, pressure, sound, pH, solvent composition and others. They are classified based upon their origin (natural or synthetic), configuration, polymer composition, types of crosslinking, physical appearance and network electrical charge. Through the last two decades, natural hydrogels were gradually substituted by synthetic hydrogels that exhibit prolonged service life, higher water absorption capacity, and gel strength. Conventional hydrogels often lack mechanical properties and functionalities required for their targeted applications. To overcome these drawbacks, blending of synthetic and natural polymers is accomplished that endows the desirable properties of both the components to hydrogels. Another approach is the formulation of nanocomposite hydrogels, that are hydrogel matrices loaded with inorganic or organic nanoparticles [NP] as nano fillers or nano reinforcements (examples: nanoclays, carbon nanotubes, hydroxyapatite, and NP of silica, calcium, silver, gold, titania, alumina and others). Such hydrogels show improved physical, chemical, biological properties and promising performance characteristics relative to pristine hydrogels, correlated to enhanced interactions between hydrogel polymer backbone/chains and the introduced NP. They find versatile applications in hygienic products, drug delivery systems, food additives, pharmaceuticals, tissue engineering, wound dressings, biosensors and others. [2–6]. Polyvinyl alcohol [PVA] is a bio-friendly polymer and because of its good water-solubility, biodegradability, and biocompatibility, applied in various biomedical applications like injury dressings, fracture fixings, cover coatings and as sutures [5,7]. However, PVA is relatively expensive with lower biodegradation rate and negligible antibacterial properties [8,9]. Thus, to reduce cost and improve performance, blending with natural polymers like starch [ST] is accomplished owing to its low cost, non-toxicity, biocompatibility and biodegradability in nature [10]. However, its films lack strength, water resistibility, processability and thermal stability, which are overcome by blending with PVA. Thus, blending PVA with ST is a synergistic approach, utilizing useful properties of both the components, and the properties of such blends can be further reinforced by the introduction of polyols, nanoparticles [NP] such as nanoclay, carbon nanotubes, halloysite nanotubes, nano‑silicon dioxide and also by incorporating lipids or essential oils [10–15]. Plant oil-based polyols (often) contain triglyceride chains (from parent oil) with pendant hydroxyl groups in their backbone. They are obtained by several chemical methods such as epoxidation, hydroformylation, ozonolysis, and amidation of plant oils. These are used as cost-effective, non-toxic and environment friendly monomers for production of polyesteramides, polyetheramides, polyurethanes and others. The multiple hydroxyl groups of polyols serve as crosslinking sites producing crosslinked networks, thus governing the thermal and mechanical properties of polymers [16,17]. When incorporated in hydrogels, polyol influences stability, hydrophobicity, morphology, swelling capacity, viscosity, gelation time, Tg and exquisiteness of hydrogel films [18–22]. In PVA/ST blends, polyols are included as they hinder stronger interactions between PVA and ST (in the form of hydrogen bonding, that restrain the molecular movement and processability of these blends), and form new hydrogen bonds between the two, thus enabling better segment mobility, and improving thermal stability [11,12,15]. Ocimum forsskaolii Benth. belonging to the family Lamiaceae, which is represented by 26 genera and about 70 species in Saudi Arabia, is a medicinal herb, traditionally used for treatment of many infections [23,24]. Silver nanoparticles [NP] show antimicrobial activity against various fungi and bacteria and are used in formulations to protect wounds from secondary infections and help in wound healing [5,25]. The present scenario demands for environment friendly, structurally interesting and natural (renewable resource based) functional materials with low cost, improved performance, no/less hazardous emissions/wastes, devoid of complex synthesis routes and toxic solvents [26,27]. Taking this in consideration, the research work reports the preparation of polyvinyl alcohol/corn starch [PVA/CS] nanocomposite hydrogel film incorporating Linseed oil [LO] derived polyol [LP], and silver NP biosynthesized in leaves' extract of Ocimum forsskaolii Benth. [LEO]. Tween 80 was used as surfactant and emulsifier, and glutaraldehyde [GA] as cross-linking agent. The effects of LP and NP on structure, water absorption capacity, morphology, hydrophobicity, thermal stability, biodegradation potential, and antimicrobial behavior were studied. Thus, in this manuscript, an attempt has been made to develop nanocomposite hydrogel through benign route, considering the present growing need to include environmentally friendly operations devoid of toxic chemicals, utilizing renewable resources, yielding products with low cost and improved performance, according to “Green Chemistry” principles (Principle: 1,3,5,7,8,12) and “Cleaner Production” concept. [28,29]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Corn starch [CS] (C6H10O5)n, MW (162.14)n [CS] (Loba Chemie PVT. LTD., India), Polyvinyl alcohol [PVA], MW 14,000 (High Purity Laboratory Chemicals, Mumbai, India), silver nitrate [SV] (extra pure from ScharlauChemie S.A., Sentmenat, Spain), tween 80, glutaraldehyde [GA], d-glucose, sodium chloride, urea, potassium iodide [KI] and ethanol (Loba Chemie PVT. LTD., India) were used as received. Linseed oil based polyol [LP] was synthesized as reported previously [30,31]. Fresh leaves of Ocimum forsskaolii Benth. (Family: Lamiaceae) plant (bearing pink flowers), were collected from Al-Rajhi mosque garden in Makkah city, in the month of October, and this plant was identified by Dr. Kadry Abdel Khalik, Botany Department, Faculty of Applied Sciences, Umm Al-Qura University. The voucher specimen was submitted in the herbarium of Pharmacognosy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, with number UQU-2016-2. Deionised water [DI] was used in the preparation of hydrogels."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Preparation of polyol LP was prepared from LO, according to a previously reported method [31], keeping the ratio of double bonds of LO:acetic acid:hydrogen peroxide as 1:0.5:1.5. LO, glacial acetic acid and concentrated sulphuric acid (as catalyst; 6% with respect to acetic acid v/v; diluted with DI in ratio 1:1 v/v) were taken in a three necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with a thermometer and cold-water condenser. This flask was immersed in a cold-water bath, placed over a magnetic stirrer, and hydrogen peroxide was then added dropwise into the reaction mixture. After the addition of hydrogen peroxide was complete, the temperature was increased to 50 ± 5 °C, and under constant stirring, the reaction was closely monitored by determining epoxide equivalent (EE) at regular intervals of time, by withdrawing aliquots of reaction mixture from the reaction flask in due course of epoxidation reaction. When the required (low) EE was achieved, sample of the reaction mixture was subjected to FTIR analysis, to confirm the epoxidation reaction. The reaction temperature at this stage was raised to 75 ± 5 °C and was continued at this temperature until the desired (high) EE was reached, as found by EE determination during hydroxylation reaction. Again, sample of reaction mixture was taken to record FTIR spectrum to confirm hydroxylation reaction, producing LP. The reaction product was then dissolved in diethyl ether and washed with sodium chloride solution in a separatory funnel, until no traces of acid were found, i.e., the pH reached 7. LP was then dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, and diethylether was removed using rotary vacuum evaporator at 45 ± 5 °C. LP obtained was golden yellow in color. It was then subjected to spectral analyses (FTIR and NMR) for confirmation of its structure. 2.2.2 Preparation of LEO and silver nanoparticles Freshly plucked leaves of Ocimum forsskaolii Benth plant (bearing pink flowers) were washed with DI and dried in shade. Next, the dried leaves were crushed and boiled in DI (10%w/v) for 10 min. The boiled solution was cooled to room temperature and the leaves' extract [LEO] was filtered through whatmann filter paper. A portion of LEO was subjected to preliminary phytochemical analysis by standard methods [32] and the rest was stored to be used in the preparation of silver NP. LEO and 0.01 M SV solution in DI were used in the preparation of NP [33,34]. LEO (1 ml) was added to SV solution (9 ml) and the contents were allowed to react at room temperature for 2 h. The change in color of solution was observed from light yellow to dark brown indicating the formation of silver NP. The formation of NP was further confirmed by FTIR, UV, XRD and TEM analyses. After 2 h, this LEO/NP solution was poured in PVA/CS/LP blend (as described below). 2.2.3 Preparation of hydrogel films PVA (1.4 g) and CS (0.6 g) were taken in DI (25 ml), along with LP (0.02 g) and tween 80 (0.02 g) (both LP and tween 80 had been dissolved in ethanol prior to addition). This PVA/CS/LP blend was constantly stirred for 60 min at 70 ± 5 °C and then cooled to room temperature. LEO/NP solution was slowly added to PVA/CS/LP hydrogel blend, and further stirring was continued up to 60 min at room temperature. To the hydrogel blend, GA (dissolved in ethanol with HCl) was then added dropwise with constant stirring. Care was taken to eliminate entrapment of air bubbles during mixing. The hydrogel blend (Scheme 1 ) was then poured into glass petri dish and dried at room temperature for 72 h to obtain hydrogel film of PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP (Fig. 1 ). The required thickness of the hydrogel film (depending upon the targeted application) can be obtained by adjusting the amount of the blend poured on the glass petri dish. As a control, PVA/CS, and PVA/CS/LP hydrogel films were also prepared in a similar manner with PVA, CS, LP, tween 80 and GA. It is important to mention that LP was incorporated in different weight percentages in hydrogel films to ascertain the maximum amount of LP that could be incorporated in hydrogel films, and 1% was found to be the optimum content."
4,"Characterization of LP, NP and hydrogel films","The photographs of samples were taken by iPhone6 camera. Phytochemical analysis of LEO was performed by standard methods. UV–vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 35) (Perkin Elmer lambda,Waltham, MA, USA) was used to analyse the NP. To study the shape and size of NP, Transmission electron microscopy [TEM] was performed on TECNAI 200 kV TEM operating at 200 kV (Fei, Electron Optics), equipped with digital imaging and 35 mm photography system, at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. A well diluted solution of LEO:NP solution was transferred to a “click-lock” 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. The tube was submerged for sonication in water in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. A drop of this solution was placed on copper grid using a micro pipette, and after drying it well, the grid was subjected to TEM analysis. XRD of NP was performed on X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV model, Rigaku cooperation, Japan) with Cu Ka radiation (k50.15406 nm). FTIR spectrum of LP was recorded on IRAffinity-1 CE (Shimadzu corporation analytical and measuring instrument division, Kyoto, Japan), scanned from 4500 to 600 cm−1 with 40 scans at 4 cm−1 resolution, using IR solution software for data acquisition. ATR spectra of NP and hydrogel films were taken on Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR, TENSOR 37 spectrophotometer, Germany, BRUKER make) in the mid operating range of 4000–600 cm−1. The sample was placed onto the Universal Diamond ATR top plate and spectra were recorded. The data acquisition was carried out through Opus-Spectroscopic software. NMR spectra of LP was recorded using CDCl3 as solvent and tetramethylsilane as internal standard, on JEOL GSX 300 MHz FX-100. The morphology of hydrogel films was observed by biomicroscope (Nikon Eclipse 50i, Japan) and Scanning Electron Microscope [SEM] (model ZEISS EVO 50 SERIES; EHT =3.00 KV, Signal A = InLens). The hydrophilicity of hydrogel films was investigated by water contact angle measurements performed on CAM 200 Attention goniometer. Thermal analysis of hydrogel films was carried out by TGA (Mettler Toledo AG, Analytical CH-8603, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland) in nitrogen atmosphere and at heating rate 10 °C/min. Swelling studies of hydrogel films were performed in water and buffer solutions (pH 4 and 7.4). For equilibrium weight of swelling [EWS] % in water, small square pieces of hydrogel film samples (1 cm × 1 cm) were weighed and then immersed in water. The weights of hydrogel films were recorded before and after contact with solutions. The swollen hydrogel films were removed from solutions at periodic intervals, quickly blotted with tissue paper, weighed and replaced in fresh solutions. The swelling measurements were carried out at room temperature till constant weight was achieved by using the following equation: % EWS = W wet − W dry × 100 Wdry where Wwet is weight of swollen and Wdry is weight of dry hydrogel film [21,22]. EWS% in simulated biological fluids such as d-glucose (5%), sodium chloride (0.1%), urea (5%), and potassium iodide (15%) was also recorded. All the solutions were prepared by standard protocol and standardized by pH meter (Hanna Instruments, Romania). Effect of soil burial on hydrogel films was carried out to study their degradation potential in soil. Small square pieces of hydrogel film samples (2 cm × 2 cm) were pre-weighed and buried in soil at the depth of 10 cm, each one flagged with its own number, to avoid any misleading. After different time intervals (24 h, 48 h, 1 week, 2 weeks and so on), the films were carefully pulled out from the soil, cleaned gently and the changes in their appearance, texture, color and weight were recorded. Antimicrobial screening of hydrogel films was performed to investigate their action against microbes mentioned further. Mueller Hinton agar was seeded with appropriate well-mixed overnight culture of each test microorganism, each was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard. Test microorganisms included: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATTC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 26922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 29906), Klebsiella pneumonia (MTCC109), Acinetobacter baumanii (NCTC 12156) and Candida albicans (ATCC90028). About 1 × 106 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were used, by streaking evenly on to the surface of the medium with a sterile cotton swab to allow for even growth. Wells were cut from the agar plates using a sterile cork-borer. The wells were loaded with 30 μl of sample using a sterile micropipette allowing a 10 min diffusion time. For sheets, the hydrogel films were cut into 6 mm discs and they were also tested. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h thereafter the plates were examined for any clearing zones around the well and/or discs. The zones of inhibition were measured in mm. This experiment was carried out three times for confirmation. Diameter means and standard deviations were calculated [35]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Synthesis,"4.1 Synthesis The preparation of hydrogels was accomplished by eco-friendly route devoid of solvents using non-toxic constituents: PVA, CS, LO, LEO and silver NP. PVA and CS formed the matrix of hydrogel films. LP obtained by hydroxylation (epoxidation followed by hydration) of LO, and NP biosynthesized with LEO, acted as modifiers. PVA/CS nanocomposite hydrogels were prepared by simple blending with LP, tween 80 and biosynthesized NP (Scheme 1). Hydrogel blends were poured on glass petri dishes and were left undisturbed to dry at room temperature. The films could be easily peeled off the substrate, i.e., the petri dishes after 72 h. The formation of nanocomposite hydrogel film is facilitated by hydrogen bonding between functional groups of hydrogel polymer backbone, NP- matrix interactions and also through crosslinking by GA. Transparent and flexible, pore free and crack free hydrogel films were obtained (Fig. 1). The films were visually homogenous and there were no signs of phase separation between the components, and no bubbles were entrapped. To ascertain the maximum/optimum concentration of LP that could be loaded in the hydrogel films, LP was added in amounts >1% in the films. It was found that above 1% LP inclusion, the films shrunk around the circumference and became very stiff (solid) throughout, to the extent that they were not films any more, rather hard plastic material (Fig. 1 d). Plant oil polyols contain hydroxyl groups and double bonds (depending upon the extent of epoxidation and hydroxylation reactions on parent oil backbone, that consume the double bond) that provide crosslinking sites. It is important to mention that the double bonds are amenable to auto-oxidation through oxygen in air, via radical recombination thus facilitating high cross-linking of oil/oil polymer chains [36]. Due to >1% addition of LP in hydrogel film the crosslinking becomes undesirably high, both through -OH groups and double bonds (auto-oxidation), thus rendering a very stiff material, that altogether loses its filmogenic property. The films varied in color, and each composition was well discernible, owing to its constituents. Likewise, the films also varied in their morphology as discussed in proceeding section. While PVA/CS film was transparent and colorless, the PVA/CS/LP film bore yellowish tinge due to the inclusion of LP which is golden yellow in color and the nanocomposite hydrogel film, PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP, appeared of darker hue due to the inclusion of LP, NP and LEO, however, retaining the transparency. This study is the first of its kind using plant oil based polyol with PVA/CS combination, instead of commercial polyols, for film formation [12,15]. The commercial feasibility of synthesis processes often remains questionable due to the use of toxic and expensive raw materials, utilisation/generation of hazardous substances, use of solvents or formation of side products, cumbersome, time and energy consuming synthesis reactions, involving serious concerns regarding the degradation of final product after use. The reaction strategy followed here complies with the concept of “Cleaner Production” and principles of “Green Chemistry” (Principle: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 12) as: (i) no external reducing and stabilizing agent was used, (ii) no toxic component or solvent was used, (iii) reaction was not performed at very high temperatures, (iv) there were no side reactions or generation of harmful substances, (v) involving cleaner production of biodegradable hydrogel films at room temperature utilizing the potential of natural products through simple approach [27–29,37,38]."
7,Synthesis and characterization of LP,"4.2 Synthesis and characterization of LP LO renders LP by trans hydroxylation, involving “single-pot, multi-step reactions”, through epoxidation at its double bonds [39], followed by hydration of the formed epoxide rings. The oxirane rings of epoxidized oil react with water (hydration) liberated during epoxidation reaction, by SN2 mechanism, resulting in hydroxylation reaction, finally inserting hydroxyl groups at the double bonds of LO, producing LP. LO contains high percentage of fatty acids, oleic, linoleic and linolenic, which form the backbone of LP. Physico-chemical analysis of LP reveals that LP has lower degree of unsaturation (Iodine value 62) compared to LO (Iodine value 179) as most of the double bonds of LO are consumed during hydroxylation, producing LP with pendant hydroxyl groups. Also, LP was found to be more viscous than LO due to inter and intra molecular hydrogen bonding between its hydroxyl groups. The structure of LP was studied by FTIR and 1H NMR spectral analyses and compared with the data published previously, to confirm the structure of LP used in this research [30]. LP is made up of fatty triester chains containing hydroxyl, -CH2, CH3, and other functional groups, as shown in Scheme 1. FTIR spectrum of LP showed a broad band at 3381–3442 cm−1 attributed to OH stretches (str), 2926 cm−1 and 2854 cm−1 for CH aliphatic stretches (sym and asymm str), 1732 cm−1 for an ester carbonyl stretch, 1180 cm−1, 1242 cm−1 for -C–(C=O)-O- along with absorption bands for other functional groups characteristic for LP. 1H NMR spectrum displayed the characteristic proton resonance of -OH at δH 5.2, proton resonances at δH 1.2–2.5 (chain -CH 2) and methyl group proton resonances at δH 0.85 (chain-CH 3). The proton resonances at δH 3.6, δH 5.6 and δH 4.0–4.2 were assigned to -CH-OH, residual -CH=CH-, CH 2-O-C=O and -CH-O-C=O, respectively. These data were comparable to those reported in literature and confirmed the formation of LP [30,31,40,41]."
8,Biosynthesis and characterization of NP in LEO,"4.3 Biosynthesis and characterization of NP in LEO The results of phytochemical analyses revealed that LEO contains flavonoids, condensed tannins and volatile oil. The reducing potential of LEO components facilitates the formation of silver NP by bioreduction of silver nitrate, as can be observed by remarkable change in color of reaction mixture [33,42]. The formation of NP was supported by FTIR, UV, XRD, and TEM analyses (Fig. 2 ). FTIR spectrum of NP showed the presence of absorption bands beyond 3239 cm−1, and at 2967 cm−1, 2867 cm−1, 1650 cm−1, 1521 cm−1, 1463 cm−1, 1365 cm−1, 1054 cm−1, and 1012 cm−1, representing various functional groups such as -OH, -NH, -CH2, -C=C-, -C-O-C-, respectively. The absorption bands around and beyond 3239 cm−1 may be attributed to the presence of -OH (alcoholic/phenolic) or -NH (amide/amine), those at 2967 cm−1 and 2867 cm−1 represent -CH2, -CH3 (alkane) stretching vibrations, while absorption bands around 1650 cm−1 may be correlated to the presence of -C=O (amide carbonyl) and -C=C-, respectively. The region between 1500 cm−1 to 1300 cm−1 is characterized by aromatic ring, and -CH2, -CH3 bending vibrations while the bands at 1054 cm−1 and 1012 cm−1 are attributed to -CO- of ether linkages or alcohol/phenol. These absorption bands represent functional groups, which are actually from biomolecules of LEO, and bind with silver NP, during biosynthesis of silver NP. UV spectrum of NP showed a broad peak with maximum absorption observed at 437 nm, while XRD pattern showed peaks at 2 theta values 38.00, 44.00, 65.00, 77.00 corresponding to those observed in silver NP. TEM micrograph of silver NP in LEO reveals the presence of spherical NP of size 30 to 39 nm. The particles occur in clusters, and adhere to each other; however, their boundaries are distinctly visible. The grey covering/sheath can be correlated to the presence of biomolecules of LEO [24,34,42–44]."
9,Preparation and characterization of hydrogel films,"4.4 Preparation and characterization of hydrogel films 4.4.1 FTIR FTIR spectrum of PVA/CS (Fig. 3a) showed a broad band extending from 3000 cm−1 and beyond 3500 cm−1 due to hydrogen bonded -OH groups. The region around 2895 cm−1 is typical for -CH stretching in PVA/CS, while the absorption bands at 1423 cm−1 and 1327 cm−1 are attributed to -CH bending vibrations. The absorption bands occurring at 1089 cm−1 and 1028 cm−1 represent -C-O-H and -C-O-C- [12,45], respectively. In FTIR spectrum of PVA/CS/LP (Fig. 3b), a deeper band occurs beyond 3236 cm−1, representing the inclusion of additional -OH functional groups of LP in this hydrogel film. As compared to FTIR spectrum of PVA/CS, here prominent absorption bands are also observed at 2931 cm−1, 2870 cm−1 and at 1417 cm−1, 1327 cm−1 due CH2, -CH3 stretching and bending vibrations of alkyl chains of LP, respectively. The deeper projecting absorption bands at 1135 cm−1, 1053 cm−1, 1009 cm−1 correspond to -C-O-C ether, -C(=O)-O-C- ester and -C-O-H hydroxyl functionalities present in LP backbone [41]. FTIR spectrum of PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP (Fig. 3c) showed the presence of similar absorption bands as in PVA/CS/LP at 3248 cm−1, 2901 cm−1, 1650 cm−1, 1420 cm−1, 1324 cm−1, 1235 cm−1, 1086 cm−1, 1029 cm−1 belonging to the functional groups as mentioned above. However, some of these absorption bands apprise distinctive variations here compared to those in spectrum of PVA/CS and PVA/CS/LP. This is because of the presence of functional groups from biomolecules of LEO incidentally in PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP hydrogel matrix consisting of silver NP (as these functional groups from biomolecules of LEO bind with silver NP, during biosynthesis of the latter) [46,51]. The absence of absorption bands in the region 1740 cm−1 to 1720 cm−1 indicates the absence of aldehydic carbonyl suggesting that all aldehydic functional groups of GA have participated in crosslinking of films [47]. 4.4.2 Morphology of hydrogel films The hydrogel films showed evident variation in color and morphology, depending upon their composition. The biomicroscope images of PVA/CS hydrogel film (Fig. 4a) revealed that there was no phase separation evident, which showed that the constituents were blended well, though CS phase was well discernible within PVA matrix. In PVA/CS/LP hydrogel film (Fig. 4b), LP globules were easily distinguishable in the matrix showing the incorporation of LP, while large sized silver particles could be observed embedded in PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP hydrogel film (Fig. 4c). The water imbibed in swollen PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP hydrogel film (Fig. 4d) resulted in its somewhat cloudy appearance. SEM micrograph of PVA/CS/LP (Fig. 5b) showed LP embedded as globules/spheres in PVA/CS matrix. These globules had distinct boundaries and were of lighter hue compared to PVA/CS matrix. The micrograph presented somewhat smooth morphology compared to that of PVA/CS (Fig. 5a), obtained due to the presence of LP that introduced better compatibility between PVA and CS chains [11]. In PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP (Fig. 5c), the LP globules were aligned edge-to-edge and silver NP could be seen well adhered upon the LP globules, due to good NP-LP (matrix) interactions. In dark grey color PVA/CS matrix could be seen embedded globules of LP of slightly lighter grey shade, with dark (black) spheres of silver NP, arranged as strung set of beads (LP globules) decorated with black pearls (spherical NP). 4.4.3 Contact angle PVA/CS film showed water contact angle value about 50°, while with inclusion of LP, as in PVA/CS/LP, the water contact angle value decreased further (40°) (Fig. 6 ). Low water contact angle values are indicative of hydrophilicity of material. Neat PVA has very low water contact angle value (28°) [11]. However, on blending with CS, and crosslinking with GA, the water contact value here in PVA/CS was increased. Due to LP containing number of pendant hydroxyl groups in its fatty acid chain, which are capable to attract large number of water molecules, the contact angle value in PVA/CS/LP decreased further. However, on loading with silver NP, the surface roughness of the nanocomposite hydrogel film is enhanced, such that the contact angle value is again raised in nanocomposite hydrogel (53°), which is well in the optimal ɵ range for protein adsorption and cell adhesion [48], suggesting its prospective use in wound dressings. 4.4.4 Swelling studies EWS% in water, buffer solutions (pH 4 and 7.4) and some physiological solutions were evaluated (Fig. 7 ). These GA crosslinked hydrogel films imbibe water and swell due to polar groups in their backbone. The water absorption process was monitored by change in weight of hydrogel film on immersion in water/solution, which correlated to the amount of imbibed water/solution by that hydrogel film. PVA/CS film (EEW%: 105) absorbed more water than plain PVA film (EEW%: 93) due to hydrophilicity of CS. Also, PVA/CS/LP (EEW%: 187) had higher swelling ability than plain PVA and PVA/CS films, as can be seen from Fig. 7. This was attributed to the higher number of hydroxyl groups in PVA/CS/LP, introduced through the inclusion of LP, that attract and undergo hydrogen bonding with water molecules, and raise EWS%. With the inclusion of NP as in PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP, EWS% of nanocomposite hydrogel film (EEW%: 129) was found to decrease compared to PVA/CS/LP. NP adhere to the surface of LP globules as can be seen in SEM micrograph (Fig. 5). Thus, the effect of blend components on water absorbing tendency in nanocomposite hydrogel film is masked by matrix-NP interactions. These highly active physical interactions between NP-blend matrix's components (mainly hydroxyl groups) lower the possibility of availability of polar groups for water absorption. Also, NP embedded in the hydrogel matrix provide tortuous path to the diffusion of water molecules within hydrogel film, thus reducing swelling ability. The samples showed weight loss after reaching equilibrium. The contact angle value decreased for PVA/CS/LP while EWS% increased for the same, as compared to PVA/CS, while with the inclusion of silver NP, contact angle value in PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP is increased and EWS% value decreased, relative to PVA/CS/LP. These results are in close agreement with each other and confirm the role of LP in attracting water molecules (by hydrogen bonding), increasing hydrophilicity and causing expansion of films. Similar trend was also followed in other solutions, i.e., pH 4 and 7.4, as well as in some physiological solutions such as d-glucose, sodium chloride, urea, and potassium iodide [11,21,22], the response to which may serve as a powerful tool to be exploited in drug delivery. PVA/CS/LP and PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP have shown good response to swelling and stability in acidic medium. 4.4.5 TGA & DSC The hydrogel films (Fig. 8a) showed three-step degradation pattern. The initial 10 wt% loss occurred at 289 °C, 298 °C and 308 °C in PVA/CS, PVA/CS/LP and PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP, respectively. This step could be attributed to the onset of thermal degradation of the matrix (blend) wherein the PVA hydroxyl groups of the hydrogel films react with those of CS, through the formation of oxi (O) groups, and subsequently loss of water occurred, followed by chain scission and decomposition as temperature increased further. As thermal degradation proceeded, it could be observed that for every weight percent degradation, the degradation temperatures for PVA/CS and PVA/CS/LP varied, that is, the thermal degradation for PVA/CS/LP proceeded at higher temperature compared to PVA/CS, due to the incorporation of LP fatty ester chains in the blend matrix. 30 wt% loss occurred at 367 °C and 381 °C, while 50 wt% loss was observed at 418 °C and 428 °C, respectively, in PVA/CS and PVA/CS/LP, while beyond 80 wt% decomposition, the degradation temperatures varied only marginally. DSC thermograms (Fig. 8b) showed endotherms centred at 125 °C and 240 °C in PVA/CS, while at 135 °C and 250 °C in case of both PVA/CS/LP and PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP, respectively. PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP showed similar degradation pattern and degradation temperatures as PVA/CS/LP, until 85 wt% loss, beyond which the difference became evident in TGA thermogram. It can be inferred that the incorporation of silver NP did not affect the thermal stability of hydrogel film [13,49]. The presence of LP improved the thermal stability as it conferred good crosslinking and physical bonding between the matrix blend components [21]. These hydrogel films can be safely employed upto 200 °C. 4.4.6 Antibacterial studies Table 1 showed the antimicrobial activity of LEO, silver NP biosynthesized in LEO and hydrogel films of PVA/CS, PVA/CS/LP and PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP. Silver NP showed good antimicrobial activity against all the microbes used in the study, with the highest activity shown against P. mirabilis and C. albicans, as could be inferred from the largest zone of inhibitions in these two cases. PVA/CS and PVA/CS/LP showed no activity against any of the tested microbes, while PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP showed good antimicrobial activity against all the tested microbes, due to the embedded silver NP [49,50]. LP had no contribution in conferring antimicrobial activity to the hydrogel films. PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP hydrogel film showed slightly lower diameter of zone of inhibition, as resulted in some bacteria (i.e., K. pneumoniae, A. baumanii, S. aureus, E. faecalis, and P. mirabilis) compared to LEO/NP, presumably due to the antibacterial effect of NP being slightly masked off by the presence of other components in hydrogel films such as PVA, CS, LP and GA. However, both LEO/NP and PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP hydrogel film showed most pronounced effect against C. albicans. LEO/NP was associated with enhanced broad-spectrum activity against both bacteria and yeast, showing highest antimicrobial activity against P. mirabilis and C. albicans. NP cause damage to bacterial cell/membrane either as they adhere to bacterial cell wall and cause disruption in cell wall permeability and cellular respiration, or they interact with P and S containing compounds such as deoxyribonucleic acid and proteins, causing structural changes, degradation and finally cell death [25,42]. 4.4.7 Soil burial The data for degradation (change in color, texture, signs of breaking) was recorded weekly. For comparison, soil burial study on pure PVA film was also included. The degradation was observed from its weight loss, formation of pores in the samples, increasing softness and breakage in small pieces after being buried in natural soil for more than 1 month. After 2 weeks of soil burial, plain PVA film was completely unaffected in terms of color, size and texture, while in the other films first and slight signs of biodegradation were visible in the form of color change. After soil burial for 3 weeks, signs of degradation were evident. While PVA film became larger in size but remained glossy, PVA/CS film became slightly soft in texture and appeared yellow as CS being more prone to microbial attack. PVA/CS/LP film shrunk and turned brown and soft, and nanocomposite hydrogel film became very soft and black. PVA/CS/LP degraded faster than pure PVA or PVA/CS film, which can be correlated to the presence of LP. After 4 weeks, plain PVA film showed no change in appearance or texture, i.e., still remained larger and glossy, PVA/CS film was yellow and soft, while PVA/CS/LP film turned softer, had shrunk and eroded, and PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP film had completely darkened and became breakable. Thus, it can be understood that the introduction of LP in hydrogel matrix had triggered degradation in soil environment and the synthesized hydrogel films were found to be biodegradable under soil burial. After 12 weeks, PVA showed slight signs of biodegradation, while PVA/CS showed higher biodegradation compared to plain PVA film, which is in confirmation with previous results [11]. PVA is resistant to biodegradation, whatever signs of degradation are evident could be attributed to its hydrolysability. PVA/CS/LP had turned very soft and fragmented, while PVA/CS/LP/LEO/NP was black, soft and crushed. The hydrogel films degraded easily in natural soil due to the action of fungi, bacteria and chemical components of the soil."
10,Conclusion,"The present manuscript reports the preparation of PVA/CS nanocomposite hydrogel film with silver NP, LEO and LP. The nanocomposite hydrogel film produced was transparent, flexible and foldable, crack free and homogenous, antimicrobial and volatile organic component free. This is a synergistic approach wherein the phytochemical constituents of the plant extract provide functional groups for synthesis, stabilization and capping of NP, preventing agglomeration of NP and reducing their toxicity, while NP capped with phytochemical constituents contribute to the antimicrobial activity. The equilibrium swelling percentage, biodegradability behavior and thermal stability improved due to the introduction of LP while the nanocomposite hydrogel film owed its antimicrobial behavior solely to the presence of silver NP, that further widens its applications in wound dressings and antimicrobial packaging. The simple and green chemical approach utilizes leaf extract of a locally grown plant and a vegetable oil-based polyol, with water as solvent, at lower temperature, by “green chemistry” principles. The hydrogel films were fabricated by simple and eco-friendly cleaner production strategy, benefitting human health and environment"
