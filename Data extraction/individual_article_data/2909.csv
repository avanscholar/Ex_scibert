0,Introduction,"The use of TiO2 as photocatalyst has been demonstrated to be an excellent technology to degrade many pollutants in both gas-solid and liquid-solid regimes giving rise to their complete mineralization. However, photocatalysis, that has been associated with non-selective radical reaction pathways, can also be used to selectively oxidize and/or reduce substrates producing higher value chemicals [1,2]. In recent years the attention has moved to the use of this technology for selective organic transformations [3], including selective partial oxidations [4], reductions or coupling reactions along with fuels production. Among these reactions the selective conversion of alcohols to carbonyl compounds without over-oxidation is an important organic transformation because of the wide application of aldehydes in fragrance, alimentary and pharmaceutical industry [5]. The photocatalytic selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes in the presence of O2 is a challenging reaction which has turned out to be the most popular probe reaction for testing new materials as photocatalysts in selective reactions [6,7]. TiO2 under UV irradiation readily forms hydroxyl radicals which unselectively attack organic matter. An alternative photocatalyst with lower oxidant ability could avoid the complete oxidation of the substrate. A new photocatalytic material with appropriate thermodynamic requirements to perform selective partial oxidations is polymeric carbon nitride (C3N4). Antonietti et al. proposed the use of this metal-free semiconductor as heterogeneous photocatalyst [8]. This layered material consisting of conjugated two-dimensional tri-s-triazine-based C–N groups forming graphite-like structures is chemically and thermally robust and easily prepared by thermal polymerization of cheap and abundant C,N-rich precursors. C3N4 shows a lower band gap than TiO2 (ca. 2.7 eV), hence sunlight can be used to initiate photocatalytic reactions [9]. The favourable energies of its conduction (CB) and valence (VB) bands and the absence of hydroxyl groups on the surface, which favour the direct formation of the unselective HO radicals, make C3N4 an optimal candidate to be utilized in selective photocatalytic oxidations even in aqueous solutions [10,11]. The electrons promoted into the CB of C3N4 are able to reduce O2 to form the superoxide radical anion (O2 –) and successively H2O2. On the contrary, the potential of the holes generated on the VB is not sufficient to oxidize OH– to form HO radicals. However, the performance of C3N4 is still hindered by its low electrical conductivity, lack of absorption above 460 nm and recombination of photogenerated excitons [12–14]. EPR represents an appropriate tool to determine the course of paramagnetic charge carriers and to investigate the photogenerated charge carrier behaviour, especially the events of photoinduced electrons and holes at the material-reactant interface [14–17]. In order to improve the C3N4 performance as photocatalyst several approaches have been explored to modify/optimize its structure. Incorporation of speciﬁc substituents and functional groups [18] could increase the specific surface area (SSA), modify the band gap energy and/or improve the electron-hole separation. Several morphologies of C3N4 have been obtained by different synthetic routes [19]. Non-metallic elements incorporated into the C3N4 layer, induce superior performances [20–24]. The O-doping process has been reported as an effective method to enlarge surface area and improve the conductivity for the enhancement of catalytic performance [25–29]. The C3N4 absorption band edges were red-shifted with increasing oxygen dopants. Also, a post-treatment of the bulk C3N4 can produce oxygen-doped C3N4 with a narrower band gap and a higher specific surface area, exhibiting photoactivities improved by four times compared to the pristine C3N4 for dye degradation or H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation [26]. In the present work, four different C3N4 photocatalysts were studied. A polymeric C3N4 obtained by melamine annealing (MCN), a thermally etched material, resulted from a further calcination of MCN in air (MCN-TE), a stable adduct composed of the thermally etched material with H2O2 (MCN-TE-H2O2) and a C3N4 prepared in the presence of H2O2 under hydrothermal conditions (MCN-H2O2). The aim of this work was to understand some physico-chemical differences among these four specimens in terms of photoconductivity and capability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for the photocatalytic activities. Physico-chemical characterization studies help to justify the photocatalytic activities in water of the four powders for the partial oxidation of three organic alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of the photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of the photocatalysts The polymeric carbon nitride labelled as MCN, was prepared via thermal condensation of melamine as reported before [9]. Melamine (10 g) was placed in a covered ceramic crucible and heated at 520 °C for 2 h. MCN was then subjected to thermal etching in an uncovered ceramic bowl heated at 3 °C min−1 and maintained for 4 h at 500 °C. The obtained light yellow powder was designated as MCN-TE [9]. An oxidized C3N4, labelled MCN-H2O2, was prepared according to the procedure described before [28], where 1 g of MCN was dispersed in 80 mL of 30% H2O2 solution. The suspension was placed in a 100 mL Teflon vessel in an autoclave and hydrothermally treated (130 °C for 24 h). The powder was washed several times with hot water to remove the H2O2 in excess and finally dried at 60 °C. An alternative material was prepared as before described [30–32], by dispersing 2.8 g of MCN-TE in 50 mL of H2O2 aqueous solution (30 wt%) in an open beaker while heating at 70 °C until complete evaporation of the liquid. The obtained solid was washed with water until absence of H2O2 in the washing liquid, filtered and finally dried at 80 °C for 24 h giving the MCN-TE-H2O2 powder."
3,Characterisation of the photocatalysts,"2.2 Characterisation of the photocatalysts Powder XRD patterns were registered in an X’pert PANanalytical diffractometer, using a Ni filtered Cu-Kα radiation source and PixCel1D (tm) detector. Infrared spectra of the samples were recorded with 4 cm−1 resolution using an ATR module in a Varian 620-IR spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured by a SPECS system equipped with a Hemispherical Phoibos analyser operating in a constant pass energy, using MgKα radiation (h·ν = 1253.6 eV). The absence of CC bonds in carbon nitride made possible taking a signal of adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV as a reference. The elemental composition was estimated from the deconvoluted high-resolution XPS data, eliminating the contribution of the adventitious carbon signal. The solid-state 1H MAS NMR, 13C, 1H–13C CPMAS and 1H–15N CPMAS NMR spectra were registered using a Bruker Avance III 400WB spectrometer. The temperature programmed desorption mass-spectroscopic (TPD-MS) analysis was carried out with help of a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 system coupled with a ThermoStar mass spectrometer. For the analysis, 50 mg of powdered samples was heated from 35 °C to 500 °C at 5 °C min−1 in He flowing through the sample at a rate of 10 mL min−1. A Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer equipped with an integrated sphere was used to obtain diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) by using BaSO4 as reference. A Micromeritics ASAP 2020 was used to obtain adsorption-desorption isotherms of N2 at 77 K. Specific surface areas (SSA’s) were calculated from the nitrogen adsorption data by BET equation. Photoelectrochemical characterization was carried out by using a 450 W UV-VIS Xenon lamp coupled with a Kratos monochromator, which allows a monochromatic irradiation of the specimen that is filtered through a quartz window present in the cell. A two phase lock-in amplifier was used, coupled with a mechanical chopper (frequency of 13 Hz), allowing to extract photocurrent signals from the total current circulating in the cell. To estimate the optical band gap, photocurrent spectra were corrected for the relative photon flux of the light source at each wavelength. All the photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in 0.1 M ammonium biborate tetrahydrate electrolyte (ABE, (NH4)2B4O7·4H2O; pH ≈ 9) at room temperature (RT) with a three-electrode configuration using a Pt wire as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl/sat. KCl electrode (0 V vs Ag/AgCl = 0.197 V vs SHE) as the reference electrode. For these measurements, the different C3N4 photocatalysts were deposited on carbon paper (Toray 40% wet Proofed-E-Tek). The EPR spectra of C3N4 powders at RT or at 100 K in dark or upon continuous in situ UV photoexcitation (λ max = 365 nm; Bluepoint LED, Hönle UV Technology) were measured by EMX EPR spectrometer (Bruker), operating in X-band at 100 kHz field modulation in the standard TE102 (ER 4102 ST) rectangular cavity using thin-walled quartz EPR tubes (Bruker). The temperature was lowered to 100 K by the temperature unit ER 4111 V T (Bruker), with liquid nitrogen as the refrigerant. The EPR spin trapping technique, using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) spin trap, was applied to detect non-persistent radical intermediates generated upon UV (λ max = 365 nm) or visible exposure of the catalysts suspended in water or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/water mixed solvent (80:20 v:v) at 295 K. The photoexcitation of aerated suspensions containing both photocatalyst and DMPO took place in the resonator of the EPR spectrometer (EMXPlus, Bruker), and the generation of the spin-adducts was monitored in situ. The concentration of spin-adducts was evaluated from the double-integrated spectra using the calibration curve obtained from the EPR spectra of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine N-oxyl solutions measured under strictly identical experimental conditions. Multi-component EPR spectra were analyzed and simulated using Winsim2002 software [33]. The detailed information on EPR measurements is described in [34]."
4,Photocatalytic reactivity,"2.3 Photocatalytic reactivity Photocatalytic experiments were carried out in a water-cooled Pyrex reactor containing 150 mL of aqueous suspension irradiated with six Actinic BL TL MINI 15 W/10 Philips fluorescent lamps (λ max = 365 nm) at RT under air, in the system previously reported [9,31]. The partial oxidation of three organic alcohols, i.e. 4-methoxy benzyl alcohol (4-MBA), cinnamyl alcohol (CA) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), to their corresponding aldehydes, i.e. 2,5-furandicarboxaldehyde (FDC), 4-methoxy benzylaldehyde (4-MBAL) and cinnamaldehyde (CAL), respectively, was studied at 0.5 mM initial alcohol concentration at natural pH. The structures of the alcohols used as substrates and the aldehydes selectively obtained are shown in Scheme 1 . The amount of photocatalyst used was 50 mg, enough to absorb all the entering photons in the photoreactor. The impinging radiation energy in the range 315–400 nm was measured by a radiometer Delta Ohm DO9721 (average value ca. 8 W m−2). Natural sunlight was also used as the radiation source in an alternative 125 mL Pyrex batch photoreactor containing 75 mL of 0.5 mM alcohol suspension in the presence of the photocatalyst. The suspensions were continuously stirred and aliquots of approximately 2.5 mL were withdrawn for analyses every 30 min. The photon flux in the range of 315–400 nm, which largely determines the reactivity of C3N4, was measured every 10 min throughout the runs, and the cumulative energy (E) was estimated based on the obtained data. The E value allows the comparison of photoreactivity results obtained under natural sunlight irradiation at different meteorological conditions. It is given by: (1) E = ∫ 0 t I t d t where “I(t)” is the instantaneous photon flow and “t” the irradiation time. The values of “I(t)” were calculated from the recorded values of irradiance, UVG(t), by using the following relationship: (2) I(t) = UVG(t)×A where “A” is the total irradiated area of the photoreactor and “UVG” is the irradiance (315–400 nm wavelength range) [32]. The aliquots of reacting suspensions were filtered and analysed by HPLC. HMF and derived molecules were analysed by a Thermo Scientific Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC equipped with a Diode Array detector and a REZEK ROA organic acid column with a 2.5 mM H2SO4 aqueous solution mobile phase (flow rate 0.6 mL min−1). The aromatic species were analyzed by a Beckman coulter HPLC with a Diode Array detector. The column was a Phenomenex KINETEK 5 μm C18 and the eluent (0.8 mL min−1) a mixture of acetonitrile and 13 mM trifluoroacetic acid (20:80 v:v). Standards purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with a purity > 99% were used to identify the products and to obtain the calibration curves."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterisation of the photocatalysts,"3.1 Characterisation of the photocatalysts 3.1.1 XRD, NMR and XPS All of the samples showed the typical XRD patterns of C3N4, suffering negligible changes after the thermal etching or H2O2 treatment (see Supplementary Material), which is also corroborated by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. S2). The XRD peaks are consistent with a graphitic-C3N4 layered structure [35], and the peak at 27.4° is characteristic of an interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic systems with an average distance of 0.326 nm. The SSA’s of the powders were 7, 94, 28 and 70 m2 g−1 for MCN, MCN-TE, MCN-H2O2 and MCN-TE-H2O2, respectively (Fig. S3). A dramatic difference was observed between 1H MAS NMR spectra for MCN and the other samples attributed to the weakening of the hydrogen bonding between the C3N4Hx species as evidenced by the decrease of intensity of the peak at 9.2 ppm [31] (Fig. S4). The assignation of chemical shifts of C and N atoms constituting carbon nitride is shown in Fig. S5. 13C MAS NMR spectra (Fig. S6) and the 13C-1H MAS NMR (Fig. S7) show that the incorporation of oxygen heteroatom inside the C3N4 skeleton is unlike. Neither the 15N-1H CPMAS NMR indicated the presence of new nitrogen-containing groups after the treatment of MCN (Fig. S8). The XPS data, although not manifesting significant changes of the oxidation state of C, clearly demonstrate the redistribution of N-species and increased O content in the MCN-H2O2 sample with respect to the pristine one (Fig. S9, Table S1). Moreover, the surface elemental composition analysis of this material reveals a high C/N ratio indicating the presence of N-vacancies (Table S1). Noteworthy, TPD data show that, apart from the shift of the water desorption maximum to higher temperatures for the MCN-H2O2 sample, its decomposition starts at lower temperature, which is evident by the evolution of 17 amu (NH3 +). At low temperatures the 17 amu is attributed to the fragmentation of the H2O MS-signal, but starting from 250 °C it is assigned to (NH3 +), since the evolution of the 18 amu is dropped down. Moreover, the appearance of 42 amu and 43 amu in the mass-spectra might be assigned to the CNO+ and CNOH+ species, respectively (Fig. S10). Hence, it is suggested that the treatment of MCN with H2O2 under hydrothermal conditions provokes oxidation of the surface carbon nitride functionalities leading to the reduced N content and, possibly to the formation of surface C–N-O bonds, which could be the reason of the redistribution of N-species evidenced from the XPS analysis. 3.1.2 Optical and photoelectrochemical characterization The optical properties of the samples have been investigated by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). The energy band-gap values were obtained by extrapolating a linear fitting in the Tauc plot. The values obtained were ca. 2.7 eV for MCN, 2.8 eV for MCN-TE, whereas slightly increased to ca. 2.9 eV and 3.0 for MCN-H2O2 and MCN-TE-H2O2, respectively. Noteworthy, the two last materials showed in the Tauc plot some electronic transitions in the visible part of the spectrum, attributed to some electronic states located between the VB and the CB (Fig. S11). Generation and transport of photoexcited charge carriers in the photocatalytic process can be indirectly monitored by photoelectrochemical measurements. In fact, the photocurrent yield “Qph ” can be calculated according to ref. [36] and for photon energy close to the absorption edge, the dependence of the light absorption coefficient on hν is described by the following relationship [36]: (3) (Qph hν)n ∝ (hν – E g opt) in which E g opt is the optical band gap and the exponent n assumes different values depending on the involved optical transitions. Therefore, the photocurrent yield depends on wavelength and on the transport properties of the material. Fig. 1 (A) shows current transients under monochromatic irradiation, recorded at 0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl for all of the tested samples. The highest photocurrent was recorded for MCN-TE, whilst MCN-H2O2 had the worst performance with a strong recombination under low wavelengths suggesting a low photocarriers separation efficiency. Notably, for λ = 420 nm, corresponding to a photon energy of 2.95 eV, and therefore higher than the band gap estimated by DRS (see Fig. S11), a very low photocurrent (few nA) was recorded for MCN-H2O2, whilst no photocurrent was recorded for MCN-TE-H2O2. This experimental finding suggests a strong localization of allowed energy levels close to valence and conduction band edges of both MCN-H2O2 and MCN-TE-H2O2. This is also confirmed by the photocurrent spectra (I ph vs wavelength curves) recorded at constant potential (0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl) and reported in Fig. 1(B). Extrapolating to zero the (Q ph hν)n vs hν plots (see Fig. 1(C)), it was possible to estimate the optical band gap of the materials. Assuming indirect optical transitions (n = 0.5 in Eq. (3)), an optical band gap of ca. 2.95 ± 0.05 eV was estimated for MCN and MCN-TE, while a higher value (ca. 3 ± 0.05 eV) was estimated for MCN-H2O2 and MCN-TE-H2O2. The slight discrepancy between the band gap values estimated with DRS and photoelectrochemical measurements can be explained assuming that the allowed energy states close to the valence and conduction band edges are strongly localized due to the formation of a defective material and/or due to the lack of long range order. The contribution to the collected photocurrent from the optical transitions between these localized states is low due to poor generation and transport properties of the photocarriers generated in these states. The photocurrent (I ph) vs electrode potential curves recorded under constant photon energy for all the investigated photocatalysts are reported in Fig. 1(D). There is a clear inversion of the photocurrent sign on going from anodic to cathodic polarization. The inversion photocurrent potential can be assumed as a rough estimation of the flat band potential that is necessary to locate the Fermi level of the materials. The C3N4 Fermi level falls within the valence band and conduction band edges of C3N4 reported in the literature [11] being slightly more anodic for the MCN-H2O2 sample. 3.1.3 EPR study X-band EPR spectra of the C3N4-based powders measured at 100 K before UVA irradiation indicated an effect of H2O2 treatment on the character of paramagnetic defects generated during the synthetic procedures (Fig. S12). A single Lorenztian line with g = 2.0033 assigned to the unpaired electrons in the aromatic rings of carbon atoms (CB electrons) in the localized π-states of typical heptazine g-C3N4 dominates the EPR spectra of non-exposed MCN and MCN-TE samples [37]. The EPR spectra for the MCN and MCN-TE photocatalysts are analogous, only the intensities were higher in the case of the thermally etched material possibly due to the increased concentration of defects. On the contrary, both MCN-TE-H2O2 and MCN-H2O2 exhibited similar and more complex EPR spectra (Fig. S12), fully compatible with those measured previously for the analogously prepared oxygen functionalized C3N4 [28]. The EPR signals observed for the MCN-TE-H2O2 and MCN-H2O2 powders (stable at RT with even better resolution compared to 100 K) may be assigned to the paramagnetic species formed by the oxidation of carbon/nitrogen sites in the C3N4 network with H2O2. UVA exposure of all C3N4-based samples at 100 K resulted in the increased intensity of the single line at g = 2.0033 indicating the photoinduced generation of the CB electrons or radicals in the polymer network. The additional signals found in the EPR spectra of MCN-TE-H2O2 and MCN-H2O2 remained rather intact upon exposure (Fig. S12). The photocatalytic activity of the C3N4 materials is assigned to their ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon exposure to irradiation. Suitable positions of the CB edge of C3N4 towards the one-electron reduction of O2 determine the generation of O2 •– upon exposure of aerated suspensions. However, the consecutive reactions of the so generated O2 •– are substantially influenced by the solvent properties [38]. Although the superoxide radical anion is quite stable in the aprotic solvents like DMSO and can be easily detected by EPR spin trapping technique using DMPO [39], in the aqueous systems its reaction with protons is favorable, and hydrogen peroxide is formed and involved in further reactions or photolytic/photocatalytic processes giving rise to HO• [17]. Fig. 2 (A) illustrates the experimental and simulated EPR spectra of DMPO spin-adducts obtained upon UVA exposure of MCN-TE and MCN-H2O2 in aqueous suspensions. The dominant twelve-line signal of •DMPO-O2H (spin-Hamiltonian parameters a N = 1.411 m T, a H β = 1.121 m T, a H γ = 0.124 m T; g = 2.0058) detected, is superimposed with four-line signal characteristic for the •DMPO−OH spin-adduct (a N = 1.494 m T, a H β = 1.466 m T; g = 2.0057), and brings evidence on the reduction of O2 upon exposure of both photocatalysts. However, the observed concentration of spin-adducts was significantly lower for MCN-H2O2 representing a defective material. After irradiation stopping, the signal of •DMPO-O2H is transformed to •DMPO−OH reflecting the well-known behaviour of •DMPO-O2H in aqueous media [40]. The increased stability of the photogenerated O2 •– in aprotic media is documented in the EPR spectra recorded upon UVA irradiation of MCN-TE and MCN-H2O2 suspended in DMSO/water mixed solvent (Fig. 2 B,C). The UVA exposure initiates the predominant generation of twelve-line signal of •DMPO-O2 –/O2H spin-adducts. Further signals found in the experimental EPR spectra were assigned to •DMPO−CH3 and •DMPO−OCH3 (spin-Hamiltonian parameters in Table S2) reflecting the interactions of photogenerated ROS with DMSO solvent producing •CH3 and CH3O2 •/CH3O• radicals and their trapping by DMPO [41]. Fig. 2(C) summarizes the concentration of individual DMPO spin-adducts elucidated from the simulation analysis of experimental EPR spectra measured in DMSO/water suspensions of C3N4-based photocatalysts. The highest ability to produce •DMPO-O2 –/O2H spin-adducts was found for MCN-TE, while the ROS formation is suppressed in the case of H2O2 treated photocatalysts, which is in good correlation with the photocurrent data."
7,Photocatalytic reactivity,"3.2 Photocatalytic reactivity As far as the photocatalytic reactivity is concerned, the results are reported in Figs. 3 and 4 . The partial oxidation of the alcohol, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), proceeded giving rise to the aldehyde, 2,5-furandicarboxaldehyde (FDC), both under UV and solar irradiation. Fig. 3(A) and (B) report the conversion (X) of HMF and the selectivity (S) to FDC, respectively, during the photocatalytic experiments by using UV lamps. The alcohol conversion, X, and the selectivity, S, to the aldehyde have been calculated as follows: (4) X = [ Alcohol ] initial − [ Alcohol ] [ Alcohol ] initial × 100 (5) S = Aldehyde Alcohol initial - Alcohol × 100 Both X and S are reported vs. the cumulative energy entering the photoreactor, which corresponds to 13.3 kJ L−1 in the range 320–400 nm after 4 h of irradiation. The experiments carried out with HMF under natural solar light are reported in Fig. 4(A) and (B), where the results of each experiment, lasting 4 h, have been reported by considering the cumulative energy entering the photoreactor in the range 320–400 nm. This energy was slightly different from one run to another depending upon the weather conditions, but corresponded roughly, for a fully sunny day to ca. 27 kJ L−1. The highest HMF conversion was observed, both by irradiating with UV or sunlight, in the presence of the MCN-TE sample. It was the most active sample among all the C3N4 materials, as before observed [9,31,32]. By using UV or solar irradiation, the MCN-TE-H2O2 photocatalyst was, together with MCN-H2O2, the less active sample but the most selective one forming FDC. By comparing the results obtained under UV and solar light irradiation at the same cumulative energy entering the reactors, it can be observed that the conversion of HMF increased in the presence of MCN-TE and MCN-TE-H2O2 samples under solar light, and at the same time the selectivity versus FDC increased only when the runs were carried out in the presence of the two catalysts treated with H2O2. Noteworthy, the use of TiO2 (not shown in Figs. 3 and 4) gave rise to the complete oxidation of HMF and the reaction was completely unselective. Interestingly, by comparing the reactivity results here obtained for MCN-TE and MCN-TE-H2O2 with those reported in ref. [32], it can be observed that both conversion and selectivity at the same amount of photons entering the reactor per litre are very similar. Photocatalytic experiments carried out by using 4-methoxy benzyl alcohol (4-MBA) indicate that the conversion of 4-MBA by using the C3N4 materials was much higher than that obtained for HMF, and the selectivity to 4-MBAD was remarkable in any case. By using the UV lamps (Fig. 3 (C) and (D)), the most active materials were MCN-TE and MCN, giving rise to a conversion of ca. 98 and 63%, respectively and, at the same cumulative energy (13 kJ L−1) under solar irradiation, the conversions were nearly the same. For all of the samples, the selectivity to aldehyde at the same cumulative energy was not affected by the light source with the exception of the MCN sample that was more selective under solar irradiation. For higher values of irradiation time, the 4-MBA conversion increased, and selectivity to 4-MBAD generally decreased due to the formation of unidentified intermediates, probably derived from a further oxidation of the aldehyde. The results obtained in the presence of TiO2 P25 were modest, probably due to surface deactivation as we have previously observed in gas-solid regime with aromatic compounds [42]. To explain the high conversion of MBA it is necessary to remind the electron donating role of the substituent group -O−CH3 in the aromatic alcohol, particularly effective in the para position [43]. Photocatalytic experiments carried out by using cinnamyl alcohol (CA) as model molecule under UV irradiation, shown in Fig. 3(E) and (F), indicated that MCN-TE and MCN were also in this case the most active photocatalysts. By comparing the results obtained under UV and solar light irradiation at the same cumulative energy entering the reactors (13 kJ∙L−1), CA conversion was higher under solar irradiation (see Fig. 4(E)), for all of the catalysts, but the selectivity (Fig. 4(F)) slightly decreased. Notably, benzaldehyde was formed in all of the experiments, in agreement with the literature [44]. Indeed, the partial oxidation of CA gave rise to two aldehydes, mainly cinnamaldehyde but also benzaldehyde, although in lower amounts."
8,Conclusions,"The photocatalytic results showed that the materials prepared in the absence of H2O2 were more active both under UV and solar irradiation by using three different model molecules. MCN-TE resulted the most active generating O2 •– species identified by means of EPR investigation, and consequently, the least selective towards the aldehyde formation. The presence of H2O2 during the preparation steps did not give rise to a doped material and in the case of MCN-H2O2 the formation of a defective sample was hypothesized. Both MCN-TE-H2O2 and MCN-H2O2 samples presented lower photocurrents in accord with their photoactivity lower than those recorded for the samples that were not treated with H2O2. In addition, MCN-TE-H2O2 and MCN-H2O2 photocatalysts were less effective in forming ROS as they showed the lowest ability to produce •DMPO-O2 –/O2H spin-adducts. The above findings can explain why the H2O2 treated photocatalysts were less photoactive and more selective towards the aldehyde formation in comparison with the other samples."
