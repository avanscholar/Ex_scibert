0,Introduction,"Depletion of fossil fuels, being at present the main energy sources, as well as a negative impact of their combustion products on the environment, have resulted in an increased interest in hydrogen as one of the most promising energy sources in the future. Hydrogen, called the fuel of the future can be converted into energy not only in internal combustion or jet engines, gas power turbines but also in fuel cells. The advantage of hydrogen as a fuel is attributed to its high net calorific value compared with other fuels ( Table 1) [1,2]. One kilogram of hydrogen is equivalent to 2.75 kg of gasoline and 6 kg of methanol with respect to its net calorific value [3]. Hydrogen, due to its high energy efficiency, is also competitive with other alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, tidal and geothermal energy [2]. In the age of deterioration of the environment, the fact that hydrogen is an ecologically clean energy source is highly important. Combustion of hydrogen does not yield carbon dioxide, one of the greenhouse gases affecting the climate. A serious limiting factor in the use of hydrogen as an energy source is its explosivity in a mixture with oxygen. In addition, storage of hydrogen fuel is more difficult when compared to other fuels. Due to its low boiling point, hydrogen has to be stored in specially insulated pressure vessels. In spite of this, hydrogen storage is easier than energy storage [3]. Although hydrogen is being used as a fuel or energy source, at present its main applications are as a starting material in the chemical, refinery and pharmaceutical industries. It is used in the synthesis of ammonia and methanol and for hydrogenation of liquid oils [3]. Among other processes making use of hydrogen, one should mention the synthesis of aniline from nitrobenzene, the synthesis of hexamethylenediamine and the removal of trace amounts of oxygen in corrosion protection [3]. In refinery processes, such as hydrocracking or hydro refining, hydrogen is used to remove sulfur and nitrogen compounds. Hydrogen does not occur in nature in its elemental form but only in chemical compounds. Thus, despite its abundance on Earth, in order to produce hydrogen it is necessary to convert compounds in which it occurs. At present, the most common sources of hydrogen are nonrenewable fossil fuels, such as crude oil (ca. 30%), natural gas (ca. 48%), coal (ca. 18%), and electrolysis of water (ca. 4%) [4]. The leading technologies of hydrogen production using conventional energy sources include steam reforming of natural gas and petroleum, catalytic decomposition of natural gas, partial oxidation of heavy hydrocarbons fraction of petroleum and gasification of coal or coke. These methods are very energy-intensive and require high temperatures (>700 °C). Furthermore, all the processes mentioned above pollute the environment emitting large amounts of oxides of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen as well as ashes containing radioactive substances and heavy metals to the atmosphere [5,6]. Another important process generating hydrogen is electrolysis of water; however, it requires electrical energy coming from coal- or natural gas-fired power plants or from nuclear power plants. The advantage of electrolysis results from lack of emission of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere [4,7]. Novel methods of hydrogen production, such as photocatalytic, plasmochemical, magnetolytic or radiolytic splitting of water as well as high-temperature plasma gasification of hydrocarbons are being developed [8–11]. Decomposition of water yielding hydrogen and oxygen can also take place through mechano-catalytic splitting [12]. The share of individual raw materials in the production of hydrogen is shown in Fig. 1. At present 96% of produced hydrogen comes from fossil fuels; therefore, hydrogen cannot be treated as a product of green chemistry and an ecological energy source. The objectives of the review are to: • Describe the perspectives on hydrogen production concerning factors affecting dark fermentation that acquire basic understanding and experience about renewable resources for hydrogen generation and associated problems. • Explain the technological possibilities for hydrogen production and scale-up. • Identify the areas of additional research and practices to improve the efficiency and the gain of energy associated to the renewable resources management."
1,Perspectives on hydrogen production,"1.1 Perspectives on hydrogen production Despite the broad industrial applications of hydrogen, it is highly probable that hydrogen will soon become a main fuel for transportation services. This is caused by crude oil depletion as well as ecological aspects related to gasoline and diesel fuel usage. The awareness of people and politicians is increasing, regarding the effects of conventional transportation services on environmental pollution. Exhaust fumes emissions i.e. nitrogen and carbon oxides, particulate matter or hydrocarbons, especially affect citizens of large urban locations. Beside novel methods of exhaust fumes reduction corresponding to increasingly restrictive regulations, new technological solutions for road transportation are investigated and implemented. Among these technologies, electrical cars gain importance, mainly due to zero local emissions. However, high price, little range, relatively long recharging time and the recycling problem of used batteries limit the popularity of electric cars. Driving electric cars with hydrogen fuel cells seems to be a convenient alternative, mainly due to efficient generation of electric energy [13]. Current technologies enable to offer a similar comfort of usage, comparing to conventional cars with internal combustion engines. Taking into account that there are 1,1 billion of cars globally, road transportation seems to be an important area of future application of hydrogen as a fuel. However, this scenario may be realized providing that the technologies for safe hydrogen storage and usage as well as hydrogen distribution network are further developed. Globally, an increasing number of countries invests in programs devoted to the development of hydrogen-driven transportation [14]. Moreover, application of hydrogen fuel cells favors the decentralization of electric energy generation for industry, rural and urban areas [15] because the fuel may be used at its generation place. Furthermore, the global increase of hydrogen fuel cells popularity results in an increasing significance of renewable energy sources from biomass of various origin. Hydrogen production from biomass results in a decrease of energetic dependence of countries having limited access to fossil fuels. Biomass to hydrogen conversion may be realized via several processes i.e. gasification, pyrolysis, steam catalytic reforming, photofermentation and biophotolysis. Above mentioned methods of biomass to hydrogen conversion are discussed in chapter two and are currently widely investigated [16,17]. It is worth notifying that besides fuel generation, biomass may be simultaneously converted to various useful chemical compounds. This concept is realized by so called biorefineries [18–22]. Our paper reviews the current state of hydrogen generation via dark fermentation. The authors are aware of vast applications of dark fermentation process, thus the paper does not cover all the available data. The authors believe that the paper contains valuable set of information as well as it is an updated supplement to previous review papers devoted to hydrogen dark fermentation [23–31]."
2,Hydrogen production methods,"Production of hydrogen from renewable energy sources, including biomass, is an alternative to traditional methods of hydrogen generation. Wastes from agri-food industry rich in starch and cellulose (straw, manure, whey, distillery wastewater, molasses), pulp and paper industry wastes, wastes from the production of biofuels (technical grade glycerin) and sewage sludge can all be used in hydrogen production through metabolic processes of microorganisms [32,33]. Crops of rapidly growing plants (energy willow and poplar, silvergrass, switchgrass, grasses) are also used in the production of biomass. Carbon dioxide, being a byproduct in the process of hydrogen generation, can be completely absorbed through photosynthesis on such plantations. An increasing interest has been put in thermochemical methods of hydrogen production. Biomass gasification is one of above mentioned group of methods. The process is realized in high temperature (600–1000 oC) with limited access to oxygen, air and steam so as incomplete combustion takes place. The resulting products are high volumes of gases and little amount of carbon. The process occurs analogously to gasification of coal, resulting in the formation of synthesis gas, containing combustible products, mostly hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane and other hydrocarbons as acetylene, ethylene as well as noncombustible components: ammonia, carbon dioxide and water vapor [17,34–36] The advantage of gasification is the possibility of its application to various types of biomass. However, the biomass composition affects the composition of final products. A substrate pretreatment is of crucial importance for the gasification [37]. Following parameters are investigated: particle size, temperature, gasifying agent, the catalyst type and concentration and gasification time [38–42]. The lower the size of biomass’ particles, the shorter the time to reach the desired temperature. Furthermore, the higher the water content, the higher the hydrogen yield and the lower the calorific value of the hydrogen gas. The processes of thermochemical conversion of biomass requires large energy input, although it can also be supplied by biomass. Gasification is an efficient thermochemical method with a main disadvantage of the necessity of tar removal from the products. Another thermochemical method of biomass to hydrogen conversion is pyrolysis. The process is realized at elevated temperature (200–600 oC) in non-oxidizing conditions. The pyrolysis process may be microwave assisted in single [43] or two stage mode [39]. The products of pyrolysis include mainly charcoal, wood gas (H2, CO, CO2, CH4. C2H6) and bio-oil [15]. The efficiency of hydrogen production via pyrolysis depends on the type of catalyst [44–46], temperature, the rate of biomass heating and process time [47]. The highest yields of hydrogen are obtained from fast pyrolysis in high temperature and short reaction time, because for long reaction time charcoal is the main product [48]. Bio-oil is the decomposition product of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose. It contains mainly phenolic derivatives, carboxylic acids (up to 60–70%) [49] as well as alcohols, hydroxyl acids, aldehydes, ketones and esters [50]. One of the main advantage of pyrolysis is the possibility of its application towards various feedstock materials, while the disadvantage are the high energetic requirements. Following reactors are applied for pyrolysis: ablation, fluidized bed, fluidized bed with circulation and entrained flow reactor [47,51]. Fluidized bed reactors are the most popular due to the fastest heating of biomass as compared to other types. Chemical compounds generated in a form of pyrolytic oil may be effectively converted to hydrogen by means of catalytic steam reforming. In paper [52] bio-oil and bio-char were converted to syngas with the application of lanthanum catalyst with hydrogen yield exceeding 80%. The conversion of acetic acid and the applied catalysts are reviewed in [53]. Alcohols may be also converted to hydrogen [54]. Biomass-based methanol and ethanol are converted to hydrogen by catalytic steam reforming [22,55]. Similarly, glycerin may be converted to hydrogen with the application of platinum catalyst with a Mg3Al-LDH additive. Alternatively, hydrogen can be produced from biomass by biotechnological methods, using natural capabilities of microorganisms to generate hydrogen as one of the metabolic products. Biological technologies for hydrogen production include direct and indirect biophotolysis and photofermentation as well as the processes taking place in the absence of light, i.e. dark fermentation, bioelectrolysis and bioconversion of carbon monoxide [56]. In direct biophotolysis, the substrate for the production of hydrogen is water, which under anaerobic conditions in the presence of light, is converted into hydrogen and oxygen by microalgae, e.g., green algae or cyanobacteria [57–59]. The activity of hydrogenase, the main enzyme responsible for hydrogen synthesis, decreases in the presence of oxygen, because under aerobic conditions the electrons released during splitting of water molecules are not used for the production of hydrogen but for the reduction of carbon dioxide [57]. In the production of hydrogen by cyanobacteria, the hydrogen evolving and oxygen evolving activities are spatially separated [60]. In the case of green algae, several hours of incubation of the algae under anaerobic conditions are required for induction of hydrogenase and production of hydrogen. It was found that under sulfur deprivation conditions the green algae Chlamidomonas reinwardtii in the presence of light produce not oxygen but hydrogen [58]. Indirect biophotolysis is a two-step process in which the reactions of oxygen and hydrogen formation are separated in time. As a result, it is easier to maintain anaerobic conditions during the second step, i.e., during production of hydrogen through hydrogenesis [59]. Nevertheless, the possibility to generate hydrogen using indirect biophotolysis is limited due to low rate of the process and a high cost of photobioreactors. The yield of hydrogen production calculated as the ratio of energy generated in the form of hydrogen to the solar energy used in the process is low in both direct and indirect biophotolysis and it does not exceed 10% [5]. Photofermentation is the process during which organic acids are converted into hydrogen and carbon dioxide by photosynthesis due to the presence of anaerobic bacteria strains: Rhodobacter, Rhodobium, Rhodopseudomonas, and Rhodospirillum [61]. Hydrogen is formed as a result of reduction of molecular nitrogen in the presence of nitrogenase which also reduces protons to molecular hydrogen. Oxygen, as a nitrogenase inhibitor, is not formed in these conversions. The yield of hydrogen production is similar to the one obtained in biophotolysis and depends on the kind of microorganisms, kind of medium, design of a photofermenter and intensity of light [62]. The research regarding photofermentation often involves dark fermentation. During dark fermentation, hydrogen and methane are also produced along with volatile fatty acids and alcohols. Such compounds may be the source of electrons and hydrogen to reduce carbon dioxide and carbon source for sulfur-free photosynthetic bacteria. The combination of fermentation and photofermentation in a two-step process results in an increase of the hydrogen yield [27,63]. In the process of bioelectrolysis of water, the energy needed for conversion of organic compounds is supplied in the form of electric energy. Microorganisms support oxidation of substrates at the anode. Protons move across a proton exchange membrane to the cathode where hydrogen is produced [64]. Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) operate on the same principle [65]. Carbon monoxide coming from thermal gasification of biomass can serve as a substrate for hydrogen production. Bioconversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide with a release of hydrogen takes place in the absence of light in the presence of bacteria Rubrivivax gelatinosus [66]."
3,Dark fermentation,"Dark fermentation is considered to be the most promising method of biohydrogen production through biomass conversion, for which the net energy ratio is equal to 1.9 [64]. For comparison, in the case of steam methane reforming, this ratio is lower and equal to 0.64 [64]. Dark fermentation is also the best understood process among biotechnological methods of hydrogen production. In dark fermentation, substrates are converted by anaerobic bacteria grown in the dark ( Fig. 2). Hydrogen is the key substrate in metabolism of many anaerobic microorganisms. Such microorganisms are capable of using energy-rich hydrogen molecules, if they are available, and utilize the electrons from hydrogen oxidation to produce energy. In the absence of external acceptors of electrons, the organisms have excess of electrons generated in the metabolic processes as a result of reduction of protons yielding hydrogen molecules. The main enzymes regulating the hydrogen metabolism are hydrogenases. The two basic hydrogenases, phylogenetally different, and having different active sites are [FeFe] –hydrogenase and [NiFe]-hydrogenase. These enzymes catalyze the reversible reaction: (1) 2 H + + 2 e − ↔ H 2 [FeFe]-hydrogenases are more active in the production of molecular hydrogen than [NiFe]-hydrogenases, which primarily catalyze oxidation of molecular hydrogen. It should be noted that [FeFe] –hydrogenases are usually sensitive to oxygen [32,67]. At present, the mechanism of fermentations via glycolysis, in which metabolic processes result in the production of hydrogen from glucose, is well known (Fig. 2.). The first step of this type of fermentation is glycolysis, in which glucose is converted to pyruvate, the key intermediate with the formation of reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Under anaerobic conditions pyruvate can be converted to acetyl-CoA in the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR). The products of the reaction, in addition to acetyl-CoA and CO2, include also reduced ferredoxin, involved in the reduction of [FeFe]-hydrogenases, which subsequently reduce protons yielding hydrogen. Another possible pathway to conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA with the formation of formate is the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate formate lyase (PFL). Formate can be readily converted to hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the presence of [NiFe]-hydrogenases or [FeFe]-hydrogenases. Acetyl coenzyme A can be converted into several organic compounds being fermentation value-added products (ethanol, butanol, acetone, butyric acid or acetic acid) with the simultaneous oxidation of NADH and/or formation of ATP [68,69]. Various types of glycolytic fermentations are distinguished, depending on chemical compounds being the main final products. Hydrogen fermentations include butyrate, butanol and mixed-acid (acetic and formic acid) fermentations. The final products in butyrate butanol fermentation include butyric acid, butanol, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and acetic acid as well as other compounds, such as acetone, 2-propanol, ethanol, lactic acid, caproic acid or acetoin [69]. Mixed-acid fermentation yields formic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, lactic acid and succinic acid, glycerol, acetoin, and 2,3-butanediol. The butyrate butanol fermentation is carried out by Clostridium bacteria. Mixed-acid fermentation is characteristic for Enterobacter and Bacillus bacteria [69]. The stoichiometric, theoretically maximal, amount of molecular hydrogen per mole of glucose, according to Eq. (2), equals 12 mol [69]: (2) C6H12O6 +6H2O→6CO2+12H2 (3) C6H12O6 +6H2O→2CO2+2CH3COOH+4H2 (4) C6H12O6 +6H2O→2CO2+CH3CH2CH2COOH+2H2 However, the formation of various final products, such as acetic, propionic and butyric acids as well as methanol, butanol or acetone, lowers the amount of hydrogen produced in fermentation. The formation of acetic acid decreases the amount of molecular hydrogen formed from twelve moles to four moles (Eq. (3)). If butyric acid is the final product, one mole of glucose yields only two moles of hydrogen (Eq. (4)). In practice, the final product is a mixture of various chemical compounds, which additionally lowers the hydrogen yield to 1–2.5 mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose. The production of hydrogen from biomass is considered to be economically justified if 60–80% of the energy contained in the substrate is converted to hydrogen [7]. A possible use of organic compounds formed during the production of biohydrogen can make the process economically justified, as some value-added products may be isolated form the fermentation broth. A number of factors can affect the yield of hydrogen production by fermentation. The design and performance of such a process may be difficult. Thus, numerous studies on the optimization of conditions of dark fermentation have been carried.[68,70–78] in order to obtain the yield close to a theoretical maximum."
4,Raw materials and substrates for dark fermentation,"An important factor affecting dark fermentations results is the choice of an appropriate raw material, being the source of organic compounds serving as substrates in the production of hydrogen. This is especially crucial in the production of hydrogen on an industrial scale. Monosaccharides, such as glucose, and disaccharides such as lactose or sucrose are the most preferred sources of carbon for metabolic conversions of microorganisms in dark fermentation. Naturally occurring, renewable sources of sugars are starch as well as cellulose and hemicellulose, present in plants mostly as polymers. The use of raw materials rich in starch, which is readily hydrolyzed to simple carbohydrates, is particularly convenient [69]. The use of sources rich in cellulose and hemicellulose is more complicated. Cellulose, in particular, is resistant to chemical and biological processing due to its compact structure and hydrogen bonds between glucose monomers. Drastic conditions are often required in order to change the chemical structure which can significantly raise the cost of processing. The best starting material is the one with a simple method of initial pretreatment and a high content of readily available carbohydrates [79,80]."
5,Mono- and disaccharides,"4.1 Mono- and disaccharides Monosaccharides, such as hexoses (e.g., glucose) and pentoses (e.g., xylose) and disaccharides, especially sucrose and lactose are readily biodegradable substrates. They have been used in experiments involving dark fermentation since the 1980s [81]. Because their use in the fermentation processes does not require complicated processing and the results are reproducible, they are currently used to test new designs [82]. The highest yields were obtained for sucrose, i.e., 6 mol of H2/mol sucrose [83]. Relatively high yield was also obtained for lactose: 3 mol of H2/mol lactose [83]. The yield of sucrose per mole is similar to the yield obtained for typical hexoses [5]. Most recent trends in the studies on dark fermentation involve technologies capable of continuous production of hydrogen. Simple carbohydrates are not suitable for this type of production since their cost is too high, which makes their use unprofitable on an industrial scale. In addition, simple carbohydrates, such as glucose, are usually used in food products and/or animal feeds and their utilization for the production of biofuels is controversial. Examples of yields and operating conditions for the production of hydrogen from various simple carbohydrates both in continuous and batch modes are compiled in Table 2."
6,Renewable resources,"4.2 Renewable resources Although substrates rich in simple carbohydrates, sucrose or starch hydrolysates are commonly used in laboratory studies, their utilization on a large scale is unprofitable. Continuous hydrogen production requires renewable resources, preferably of second generation, i.e., rich in lignocellulose or starch waste, which cannot be used as an animal feed [68,94]. Carbohydrate polymers are not suitable substrates for direct usage in the production of hydrogen by dark fermentation due to their resistance to degradation. Substrates of this type are fermented slowly with a low hydrogen yield [32]. To improve the yield of hydrogen, they should be treated to break down long polymer chains to simple carbohydrates or short oligomers. One of the examples confirming this are the studies [95], in which a higher production of hydrogen from corn stover was observed following acid hydrolysis than for the untreated corn stover. Utilization in dark fermentation of troublesome wastes (organic waste of various origin, cheese whey, olive mill wastewater, glycerol after FAME production, manure) seems to be attractive [5,96–98]. Intensive research on the production of hydrogen on an industrial scale using dark fermentation of this type of raw materials has been carried out recently. 4.2.1 Organic municipal waste This group includes the organic fraction of readily biodegradable waste originating mainly from households, restaurants, food processing plant residues, etc. This waste can contain components rich in polysaccharides, such as starch, cellulose and hemicellulose as well as proteins, lipids and simple carbohydrates. Such a waste is one of the sources releasing methane to the atmosphere. It also pollutes groundwater with wastewater formed during decomposition of organic matter in landfills. The need to limit the negative effect of such a waste stimulates scientists and industry to investigate its possible application as a raw material in dark fermentation [99,100]. Another example of raw material for dark fermentation is sewage sludge. The sludge is rich in simple carbohydrates, disaccharides, and peptides. In order to generate hydrogen as the main product of fermentation of sewage sludge, it is necessary to eliminate bacteria which utilize hydrogen in their metabolic processes (especially methanobacteria). To this end, the raw material is pretreated by heat shock, ultrasonication, acidic or alkaline pretreatment or supplementation with organic compounds [101,102]. Guo et al. have studied impacts of sterilization, microwave and ultrasonication pretreatment on hydrogen production using waste sludge [103]. Sterilized sludge was found to have the highest yield (15 cm3 H2/g COD), followed by microwave pretreatment (11 cm3 H2/g COD), and ultrasonication (4.68 cm3 H2/g COD). High temperature treatment (121 °C) resulted in over a tenfold increase in carbohydrate content [103]. Such a treatment allows eliminating or limiting the activity of the organisms which consume hydrogen in their metabolic processes. In the case of food waste, the composition of feedstock for fermentation may vary depending on the season which can affect the yields of hydrogen and by-products. Albardii et al. [104] examined the effect of composition of food waste on hydrogen production based on samples containing food waste and slaughterhouse waste in various proportions. The food waste contained primarily pasta, bread, fruit, vegetable, meat and fish while the slaughterhouse waste consisted of skin, fat and meat waste of pork, poultry and beef. The samples differed in moisture as well starch, cellulose, protein, and lipid content. The lowest hydrogen production yield equal to 25 cm3 H2/g VS was obtained for the mixture rich in slaughterhouse waste, i.e., rich in proteins and lipids (a total of 48%). For the mixture rich in food waste, i.e., rich in carbohydrates (67%), the yield was over three times higher (85 cm3 H2/g VS). Karlsson et al. [105] obtained 16.5 cm3 H2 per 1 g of the waste from fermentation of a mixture of wastes (85% slaughterhouse waste, 4% food industry waste, 5% manure). The most efficient process was carried out at 55 °C using a mixed culture of bacteria and a hydraulic retention time of 2 h. Unfortunately, the hydrogen content in the biogas was low (maximally up to 2.5%). Biohydrogen production from untreated and hydrolyzed potato steam peels by dark fermentation using Caldicellusiruptor sacharolyticus and Thermotoga neapolitana was also investigated. Two types of hydrolysates were used: one in which the starch was liquefied with α-amylase, and one in which the liquefied starch was further hydrolyzed to glucose by amyloglucosidase. When glucose (ca. 10–14 g/L) was added to both hydrolyzed and unhydrolyzed peels, both strains of bacteria produced hydrogen with a relatively high molar yield (2.4–3.4 mol H2/mol glucose). When the concentration of the substrates was increased, the hydrogen production decreased [77]. Jayalakshmi et al. [106] obtained the yield of hydrogen of 72 cm3 H2/g VS added during fermentation of kitchen waste (66% food waste, 27% vegetable waste, 0.96% tea waste, 1.09% egg shells, 1.36% packing materials, 3.61% ash) using an inclined plug-flow reactor. Other examples of conditions and results of dark fermentation using food waste or food production waste are compiled in Table 3. 4.2.2 Waste of animal origin Animal waste can be a serious environmental problem. The waste contains primarily manure and leftover feed. It is used mostly on farmlands or to make composts, in which biological processes last. This results in a release of methane and other harmful gases, mostly derivatives of sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus to the atmosphere. The approach of building closed chamber composting plants, in which methane is produced, and the post-fermentation residue is used as a fertilizer, seems to be more appropriate. To be used in dark fermentation processes in which hydrogen is the main product, the waste has to be pretreated either with high temperature or microwaves, ultrasounds, acids or bases to remove methanogenic bacteria. Another problem is the presence and high content of nitrogen compounds which can be reduced to ammonia during fermentation. Ammonia at a certain concentration inhibits dark fermentation. The hydrogen yield decreases rapidly when the concentration of ammonia exceeds 2 g N/dm3 [115]. The studies on dark fermentation of manure or compost have been carried out. The possibility of continuous biohydrogen production from liquid swine manure as a substrate for fermentation was investigated [116]. The manure was diluted from a solid content of about 2% to about 0.5% and supplemented with glucose at a concentration of 10 g/dm3 as a carbon source. Fermentation was carried out in a sequencing batch reactor using the seed sludge from an anaerobic digester. The maximum hydrogen production rate was 0.15 dm3 H2/dm3/h for an hydraulic retention time (HRT) equal to 8 h and the maximum hydrogen yield was 1.63 mol H2/mol glucose for an HRT equal to 16 h. The hydrogen content in the biogas ranges from 38% to 44% and it depends on HRT. Conditions and results of dark fermentation of animal waste as well as the main organic metabolites and process parameters (i.e. temperature and pH) are compiled in Table 4. 4.2.3 Industrial waste and effluents Industrial waste and effluents rich in carbohydrates can also be substrates for dark fermentation. These include olive oil mill wastewater [120], palm oil mill effluent [121,122] and wastes from the dairy and brewery industries [75]. Kargi et al. [75] obtained hydrogen from cheese whey powder (CWP) solution by thermophilic dark fermentation. Concentrated CWP solution was deactivated by autoclaving at 121 °C for 15 min which allowed most of the proteins to be precipitated and the solution then filtered. Thus prepared substrate was fermented. The yield of hydrogen was 1.03 mol H2/mol glucose. Azbar et al. [76] produced hydrogen via dark fermentation of cheese whey wastewater rich in lactose using mixed culture under thermophilic (55 °C) and mesophilic (36 °C) conditions. The hydrogen yields were 9.2 mmol H2 /g COD and 8.1 mmol H2 /g COD under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, respectively. Substrates that do not contain carbohydrates are also being investigated. The use of glycerol, a waste in the production of FAME that is difficult to utilize in large quantities, is also of considerable interest. Nakashimada et al. [123] examined the conversion of glycerol to hydrogen via dark fermentation. The hydrogen yield was 6.69 mmol H2/g glycerol, which was significantly higher than the yields from simple carbohydrates, i.e., glucose (1.97 mmol H2/g glucose), galactose (1.90 mmol H2/g galactose) and fructose (2.17 mmol H2/g fructose). Ito et al. [124] investigated hydrogen production from glycerol-containing wastes discharged after biodiesel manufacturing process. For comparison, fermentation of pure glycerol at a concentration of 10 g/l was carried out using Enterobacter aerogenes. Both the yield and rate of hydrogen production from the waste were found to be significantly lower for the waste than for pure glycerol: 0.71 mol H2/mol glycerol and 30 cm3/dm3/h, and 0.89 mol H2/mol glycerol and 80 cm3/dm3/h, respectively ( Table 5). The lower yields of hydrogen from the waste were likely caused by a high salt content and the presence of methanol which can inhibit the process. The effect of substrate concentration on the yield and rate of hydrogen production was also examined. Silva et al. [125] investigated co-fermentation of food waste with glycerin (1%, 3% and 5%). Food was originated from students’ canteen and was composed of fruits and vegetables (57,4%), grains (13,5%), meat (26,3%; bovine, poultry, fish) and rejected materials (2,8%; bones and wastes not visually identified). The addition of glycerin (3%) resulted in more than twofold increase of hydrogen production compared to that obtained from food waste alone. The hydrogen yield was not further increased when 5% glycerin was added. Zhu et al. [126] examined biohydrogen production from purified terephthalic acid processing wastewater by anaerobic fermentation using mixed cultures and a CSTR reactor. A specific hydrogen production rate was 0.073 dm3/g cm3 VSS/d. After reaching stable operation of the reactor (25 days), the main liquid organic products formed during fermentation were acetic acid and ethanol at 476 and 431 mg/dm3, respectively. Citric acid wastewater can be used as another substrate for the production of biohydrogen. Continuous biohydrogen production from citric acid wastewater was carried out [127]. Using conditions optimal for mesophilic organisms, a hydrogen yield of 0.84 mol H2/mol hexose was obtained. Butyric acid was the dominant product among volatile fatty acids. Liu et al. [33] applied low-sugar wastewaters from juices production for hydrogen production. The process was realized in CSTR with initial total sugar concentration of 10,39 g/dm3, leading to hydrogen productivity of 11.39 L/L/d with hydrogen yield of 0.3 mol H2 per mol of hexose. The results of hydrogen fermentation of post-production wastes, temperature, main organic metabolites and process parameters, i.e., microorganisms used, temperature and pH, are compiled in Table 5. 4.2.4 Agricultural waste and energy plants This group of residues includes raw materials of plant origin rich in lignocellulose and starch. Waste lignocellulose seems to be particularly attractive as the substrate, being the residue from growing and processing of cereals and plants (wheat, rye, rice, corn, etc.) on farms. The waste includes straws, peels, cornstalks, stems, sugarcane bagasse, leaves, and grass unsuitable for a feed. Cultivation of fast-growing energy plants rich in lignocellulose such as energy willow, energy poplar, miscanthus as well as the waste from the wood and paper industry can also provide a valuable raw material for hydrogen production [136]. The annual worldwide yield of lignocellulosic biomass residues is estimated to exceed 220 billion tons which can be used for the production of second generation biofuels, including hydrogen [136,137]. Lignocellulose is composed of three biopolymers bound through covalent bonds: cellulose and hemicellulose (representing up to 70–80% of lignocellulose biomass) which are coated and associated with lignin. Hydrogen bonds are also present within polymers listed above. Depending on the origin of plant material, the content of each of the three polymers is different [136]. Cellulose and hemicellulose are the desired polymers for dark fermentation, since they contain exclusively glucose in case of cellulose and a variety of hexoses and pentoses (i.e. xylose) for hemicellulose. In contrast, the presence of lignin is disadvantageous due to its resistance to biodegradation. Only a limited number of species can decompose lignin. Plant material consisting mostly of lignocellulose is not such a good a substrate to be converted to biofuels as e.g. starch. As a result lignin presence, it does not usually undergo rapid or effective biodegradation. At present, two advanced technologies are used for utilization of lignocellulose in dark fermentation. Neither of them is ideal and in addition to significant advantages it also has some limitations. The first approach, Consolidated Bioprocess (CBP), involves the direct use of comminuted raw materials in a highly integrated, one-step process for the direct conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels. In this technology, specific bacteria generate enzymatic cocktail, hydrolyze pretreated biomass and in-situ convert the released pentoses and hexoses into biohydrogen [138]. Such an approach lowers the investment costs and the energetic requirements for the pretreatment of raw material. At present, it is believed that better hydrogen production is achieved by using thermophilic bacteria. At elevated temperatures, conversion of substrates and mass transfer are more rapid, resulting in higher hydrogen yields compared with mesophilic bacteria. However, the volumetric hydrogen production rates are lower than those of mesophilic bacteria as a result of slower proliferation and lower cell densities. The investigation of conversion of cellulose to hydrogen [139] using mixed bacterial cultures from sewage sludge revealed that the hydrogen production was carried out mostly by microorganisms close to Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum, Enterobacter cloacae and Clostridium sp. Over the temperature range from 25° to 85 °C, the activity of bacteria in the inoculum was highest under thermophilic conditions, and specifically at 55 °C resulting in the highest hydrogen yields: 15.4 mol H2/kg cellulose and 2.77 mol H2/mol hexose used and the hydrogen production was 1381.13 cm3 H2/dm3 medium. The hydrogen yield for mesophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria is low for these temperature conditions and for 30 °C and 70 °C it is inhibited. An example of dark fermentation application for substrates rich in lignocellulose is evaluated in [71], where samples of sweet sorghum, sugarcane bagasse, wheat straw, maize leaves and silphium were utilized without pretreatment for hydrogen production by the extreme thermophiles Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus. The experimental conditions and results obtained are shown in Table 6. An often problem observed with this approach is the degree of conversion of the substrate to product. For example, during fermentation of switchgrass only 1.28 g/dm3 of substrate out of 30 g/dm3 is converted into product [140]. Dark fermentation requires further comprehensive investigations, especially in the area of finding, isolating and improving strains of bacteria capable of effective direct conversion of lignocellulosic material to hydrogen. The use of genetic engineering [141] to manipulate metabolism of microorganisms can improve yields of products and thus reduce the cost of the entire process. Among others, the genes responsible for the production of organic acids can be removed. Another interesting possibility is the development of strains with efficient multi-enzyme systems, comprising mainly cellulase and xylanase responsible for degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose. It is possible through genetic modifications of cellulosome and xylanosome [142]. Examples of the use of untreated agricultural waste or microcrystalline cellulose for the production of hydrogen under both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions are compiled in Table 6. Utilization of lignocellulose in dark fermentation requires pretreatment prior to fermentation. Two methods are used: Separate Hydrolysis and Fermentation (SHF), where hydrolysis and fermentation are carried out in different tanks and Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF), where both hydrolysis and fermentation are accomplished in the same apparatus [151,152]. Pretreatment involves conversion of structural biopolymers to simple chemical compounds (hexoses, pentoses, carbohydrate oligomers) constituting good substrates for dark fermentation. Pretreatment of raw material usually takes place in two stages. The first stage includes mechanical curing, such as milling and grinding in order to provide increased surface area and porosity and thus reactivity. The next step involves chemical hydrolysis using catalysts: acids (sulfuric, hydrochloric or acetic) [153,154], bases (sodium or calcium hydroxide, ammonia) [155–157] or oxidation (ozone, hydrogen peroxide) [150,158]. An alternative approach is to use microorganisms capable of synthesizing enzymes digesting polysaccharides, mostly fungi [159–163]. Fungal pretreatment of cornstalk by Phanerochaete chrysosporium was investigated by Zhao et al. [159]. Lignin reduction was up to 34% with holocellulose loss less than 10%. Next, the pretreated cornstalk was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. The maximum enzymatic saccharification was found to be 20.3% higher than the control without pretreatment. Eskicioglu et al. [164] investigated the hydrothermal pretreatment with CO2 in the temperature range of 26 – 175 oC and the pressure ranging from 25 to 102 bar. Following substrate materials were investigated: wheat and rice straw, sorghum, corn stover and fir bark. The obtained hydrogen yield was compared with the hydrogen yield from pure glucose (135 cm3H2/g COD added). Following hydrogen yields were identified: 55 (cm3H2/g COD added) for sorghum, 52 (cm3H2/g COD added) for corn stover, 32 (cm3H2/g COD added) for wheat straw and 26 (cm3H2/g COD added) for rice straw. Dark fermentation of rice husk was investigated by Gonzales et al. [165]. The substrate was pre-treated with 5% sulfuric acid at 60 oC followed by enzymatic sacharification with varying concentrations of commercially available Cellulast 1.5 L®. The highest obtained hydrogen yield was equal to 473.1 cm3H2/g rice husk. In addition, physicochemical methods (steam-explosion) or physical methods (high temperature, ultrasonication, and microwave irradiation) are also suitable for structural destruction of lignocellulosic materials. Xu et al. [166] investigated the yield of hydrogen produced from acetic acid steam-exploded corn straw at different concentrations of acetic acid ( Table 7). In addition, after chemical or physicochemical treatment, feedstock can be subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis using cellulases or hemicellulases, during which oligomers present after chemical treatment are hydrolyzed to simple carbohydrates. Usually, such an approach greatly improves the yield of fermentation process when simple organic compounds (pentoses and hexoses) are used as a feedstock. Simple carbohydrates in solution are much more susceptible to digestion by microorganisms than the tough polymeric structures. Preparation of the feedstock to the fermentation process is complexed and energy intensive. The use of chemical compounds for hydrolysis can impact the environment and application of thermal energy and microwave radiation needed to improve monosugars yield is rather expensive. Furthermore, pretreatment in most cases induces the formation of fermentation inhibitors, such as furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, phenolic components, vanillin or fatty acids. Depending on pretreatment conditions, these inhibitors are formed in different amounts and they negatively impact the hydrogen yield during fermentation. Lin et al. [167] examined the effect of presence of fermentation inhibitors on hydrogen production yield. Several dark fermentation experiments were carried out using glucose alone and glucose with an addition of four different by-products of hydrolysis of lignocellulose. The hydrogen yields for glucose, glucose with 15 mM of furfural, 5-HMF, syringaldehyde or vanillin were 247 cm3H2/g, 242 cm3 H2/g, 234.9 cm3 H2/g, 215.6 cm3 H2/g, and 205.6 cm3 H2/g, respectively. The results demonstrate the inhibitory effect of these compounds on the activity of microorganisms, the phenolic compounds being more toxic. However, at these concentrations the inhibition is not substantial, especially for furfural and 5-HMF. The presence of inhibitors in the mixture also delays the lag phase and the log phase of the bacterial growth cycle during dark fermentation. It is also possible to pretreat a substrate by enzymatic hydrolysis alone using a mixture of isolated enzymes. At present, however, this approach is time-consuming and expensive. Despite using similar conditions of pretreatment for various substrates having similar contents of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, different fermentation yields are obtained [155]. Numerous experiments on conditions of processing of lignocellulose from various sources of plant origin have been carried out as demonstrated by a number of research and review papers published. In spite of using various substrates and processing conditions, no universal and efficient method of pretreatment has been found. Several examples of dark fermentation of pretreated substrates along with treatment conditions are compiled in Table 7. Despite great interest of the scientists in utilization of materials rich in lignocellulose to the production of biofuels, attempts to develop an efficient technology of industrial production of biohydrogen have failed up to now. It would be interesting to find such a pretreatment method and conditions that the kind of substrate used were immaterial. To this end, further research is needed on optimization of pretreatment of lignocellulosic substrates for fermentation and on finding microorganisms resistant to the presence of inhibitors in hydrolysates obtained after chemical pretreatment [168,169]."
7,Substrate concentration,"4.3 Substrate concentration A parameter important when developing the fermentation process is substrate concentration. The highest hydrogen yields are usually obtained for diluted substrates, that is 10 g/dm3 or 1% TS. A substantial increase in substrate concentration usually results in a lowered hydrogen yield. However, in order to obtain larger total volumes of hydrogen it is necessary to use higher concentrations [69]. Wu and Chang [175] fermented sucrose and observed the highest hydrogen yield (2.68 mol H2/mol sucrose) at a concentration of 10 g/dm3. The highest hydrogen production rate was obtained after increasing the concentration from 10 to 20 g/dm3. Xing et al. [176] also obtained the highest hydrogen yield (1.84 mol/mol glucose and productivity 4.26 mmol/g dry cell/h at a glucose concentration of 10 g/dm3. Liu and Shen [177] obtained the maximum hydrogen yield of 194 cm3 H2/g- substrate at a starch concentration of 2 g/dm3. With an increase in starch concentration, the hydrogen yield decreased with the simultaneous increase in specific hydrogen production rate of 237 cm3/g-VSS/d at 24 g/cm3. A further increase in starch concentration results in a decrease in both the hydrogen yield and productivity. This could be caused by a higher concentration of volatile fatty acids although the results [178] reveal that the concentrations of volatile fatty acids and alcohols decreased above the optimum starch concentration of 20 g/cm3The effect of substrate concentration on hydrogen production from starch was examined. The investigations were carried out for starch concentrations ranging from 15 to 70 g/dm3. The highest hydrogen yield (2.82 mol H2/mol glucose) was found to occur at 20 g/dm3 of starch. Lin et al. [215] also investigated hydrogen yield and production rate as a function of substrate concentration and obtained the best results at a concentration of 20 g/dm3. The substrate was xylose at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 g/dm3. At a xylose content of 100 g/dm3 medium, the hydrogen yield drops almost to zero. In investigations by Zhang et al. [179], the maximum hydrogen yield of 143.79 cm3 H2/ g TVS was obtained for a feedstock of pretreated cornstalk waste at a concentration of 15 g biomass per liter. The use of higher concentrations (20, 25, 40 g/dm3) resulted in a slight decrease in the yield; e.g., at 40 g/dm3 the yield was 122.8 cm3H2/ g TVS. In contrast, Wu and Chang [121] obtained the highest hydrogen yield and production rate (3.48 mol H2/mol sucrose and 1.65 dm3 H2/ dm3/h) at a sucrose concentration of 30 g/dm3, with a decrease in these parameters already at 40 g/dm3. The substrate concentration also has an important effect on liquid products of fermentation. The effect of substrate concentration in rice winery wastewater was investigated [180] and observed that when the substrate concentration was increased from 14 to 36 g COD/dm3, the concentrations of acetic and butyric acids both decreased from 37% and 28–26% and 20%, respectively, while the concentrations of ethanol and propionic acid increased from 17% and 18%, respectively, to 24% and 30%, respectively. An impact of initial concentration of organic kitchen waste on both the hydrogen yield and the resulting concentration of organic acids was investigated [181]. Following composition of organic waste was identified: vegetables 44%, fruits 30%, others (including coffee, tea, rice, pasta) 25%. The highest hydrogen yield (76.1 cm3H2/g VS) was noted for initial concentration of 14.3 gVS/dm3. The highest concentration of volatile fatty acids was obtained for initial concentration of 48.2 VS/dm3. Eker et al. [182] investigated an influence of monosugars concentrations on dark fermentation of acidic hydrolysates of waste paper. The highest hydrogen productivity (0.51 cm3H2/g biomass/h) was obtained for initial concentration of the sugars solution of 18.9 g/dm3. The hydrogen productivity decreases when the concentration of sugars increases above the given value due to increased formation of volatile fatty acids. The inhibition effect on hydrogen production of increased concentration of volatile fatty acids was identified [183]."
8,Factors affecting dark fermentation hydrogen yield,"Hydrogen can be produced using a number of different processes. Thermochemical processes use heat and chemical reactions to release hydrogen from organic materials such as fossil fuels and biomass. Water (H2O) can be split into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) using electrolysis or solar energy. Microorganisms such as bacteria and algae can produce hydrogen through biological processes. An improvement of hydrogen production yield in dark fermentation is the key problem determining the possibility of adaptation of this process to industrial conditions. In addition to previously described effects of kind of substrates, their structure, composition and concentration on the hydrogen production yield, a number of other factors also affect this process, including: a. Kind of microorganisms used, i.e. pure or mixed bacterial cultures, method of preparation of inoculum, composition of a medium. b. Mode and conditions of dark fermentation process which control metabolism of microorganisms, i.e. temperature, initial pH or fixed pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT) and partial pressure of hydrogen. c. Type of reactor used and its mode of operation (continuous, batch, semi-batch). Anaerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria are able to generate biohydrogen via dark fermentation [184]. To estimate the theoretical yields of biohydrogen, the glucose biotransformation reaction is widely accepted as a reference. A limitation of optimization of the fermentation process is thermodynamics of metabolic processes of microorganisms, which in addition to hydrogen also produce other metabolic products during culture growth, such as acetic acid, ethanol, butanol and butyric acid. The composition of fermentation products, including ratio of their concentrations, depends on the kind of microorganism, pH, partial pressure of hydrogen as well as the degree of conversion of a culture medium [185]. The products can be partially metabolized and included in the metabolic pathways of microorganisms but at a certain limiting concentration they become toxic to the organisms producing them, e.g. ethanol being toxic to yeast producing it. The main obstacle in obtaining high hydrogen yields during fermentation of organic waste is insufficient degree of decomposition of complex substrates. Furthermore, the need for removal of fermentation products is an important problem in maintaining dark fermentation on an industrial scale at a constant production level, especially in a continuous process."
9,Bacteria used in dark fermentation,"5.1 Bacteria used in dark fermentation In fermentation-based systems i.e. as shown in Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, microorganisms, such as bacteria, break down organic matter to produce hydrogen (Eq. (5), (6)). The organic matter can be refined sugars, raw biomass such as corn stover, and even wastewater. Because no light is required, these methods are sometimes called the dark fermentation methods. Microorganisms capable of hydrogen production occur in nature as single strains or mixtures of various species. Depending upon the kind of substrate, in research on dark fermentation both mixed cultures of bacteria originating from sewage sludge, digesters, manure, etc. as well as specially isolated strains of anaerobic and relatively anaerobic bacteria are used. Utilization of mixed cultures does not require aseptic conditions which makes their handling easier. They are also less affected by changes in kind and composition of a substrate. Hydrogen producing bacteria occurring in nature do not exist in isolation. They often live in the presence of other microorganisms, mainly archaea, consuming hydrogen in their metabolic processes. This requires special pretreatment of an inoculum to partly or completely inactivate the microorganisms responsible for hydrogen consumption. The process will be discussed in more details in Section 5.b. Bacteria participating in dark fermentation processes are anaerobic and they are classified in two ways. The first classification divides microorganisms according to their sensitivity to oxygen (strict anaerobes and facultative anaerobes). The second classification is based on temperature ranges at which their growth rate and activity are the highest (e.g. psychrophiles, mesophiles and thermophiles). 5.1.1 Obligate anaerobes This group includes microorganisms which require strictly anaerobic conditions. These are anaerobes Clostridia, Metylotrophs, Methanogenic bacteria, Archaea, and Rumen bacteria) [186]. In practice, the most widely used obligate anaerobes are from a genus Clostridium, which includes, among others, the following species: C. butyricum, C. beijerinckii, C. welchii, C. thermolacticum, C. thermocellum, C. paraputrificum C. pasteurianum, C. beijerincki, Clostridium scatologenes, C. acetobutyricum, and C. bifermentants. Clostridia produce hydrogen during the log growth phase. During the stationary phase, the metabolism is shifted towards the production of liquid organic compounds, especially volatile fatty acids [5]. An important characteristic feature is the ability to form non-vegetative forms, so called spores, which allows bacteria to survive difficult conditions, such as temperature extremes, low or high pH or the presence of toxic chemicals in the bacterial environment [186]. As a result of this property, they can be separated from the bacteria that do not form spores by inoculum pretreatment. Clostridia are capable of efficient conversion of a wide variety of carbohydrate substrates [186]. Compared to facultative anaerobes, they produce hydrogen more efficiently. A fermentation characteristic of bacteria from a genus Clostridium is butyric and acetic acid fermentation. Metabolism of Clostridium bacteria allows formation of the end products which can lower the hydrogen yield from the theoretical maximum of 4 mol/mol glucose when acetic acid is the only organic end product of fermentation (Eq. (5)) to two moles in the case of butyric acid fermentation (Eq. (6)). In practice, fermentation of carbohydrates by Clostridium bacteria results in formation of a mixture of acetic and butyric acids and depends on substrate concentration. Kim et al. [187] observed that lowering the concentration of sucrose used in fermentation from 30 to 10 g COD/L resulted in an increase in concentration of acetic acid in the post-reaction mixture from 5.1% to 40% with the simultaneous decrease in butyric acid content from 47.1% do 28.9%. Such an effect should be accompanied by an increase in concentration of hydrogen produced but this is not the case, especially when using mixed cultures due to utilization by bacteria of a fraction of generated hydrogen to produce acetic acid (Eq. (7)). The mole ratio of butyric and acetic acid can be an indicator of metabolism of a substrate and the hydrogen production yield. (5) C6H12O6 + 4 H2O → 2CH3COO- + 2HCO3 - + 4H2+4H+ (6) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → CH3CH2CH2COO- + 2HCO3 - + 2H2 + 3 H+ (7) 4H2 + HCO3 - + H+→ CH3COO- + 4H2O It follows from the stoichiometry of Eq. (6) that the maximum hydrogen yield for a B/A ratio of 1.5 is 2.5 mol H2/mol glucose. In practice, a monoculture of Clostridium sp. can produce from od 1.61–2.36 mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose [80]. Even though a wide range of microorganisms (Methylotrophs, Rumen bacteria, Methanogenic bacteria, Archaea, E. coli, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Alcaligenes, Bacillus, Clostridium sp., Clostridium butyricum, C. acetobutyricum, C. beijerinckii, C. thermolacticum, C. tyrobutyricum, C. thermocellum,C. paraputrificum, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, Thermoanaerobacterium sp., T. thermosaccharolyticum, Thermotoga sp., T. maritima, T. elfii [70,188–191] is capable to produce hydrogen via dark fermentation, mixed consortia seem to be a good alternative. Mixed consortia under strictly determined conditions [192,193] allow for a broad choice of feedstock, including a variety of natural sources, anaerobically digested sludge, animal manure, sewage sludge, compost and soil. Another genus of obligate anaerobes is Ruminococcus albus. During metabolism of carbohydrates these bacteria produce acetic acid, ethanol, formic acid, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. They are capable of direct hydrolysis of cellulose. One of few examples of utilization of R. albus was published by Iannotti et al. [194]. The authors fermented glucose (100 mol) in a continuous mode and obtained 237 mol of hydrogen, 74 mol of acetic acid and 65 mol of ethanol. In direct hydrogen fermentation, the microbes produce the hydrogen themselves. These microbes can break down complex molecules through many different pathways, and the by-products of some of the pathways can be combined by enzymes to produce hydrogen. 5.1.2 Facultative anaerobes Facultative anaerobes are organisms that produce ATP by aerobic respiration if oxygen is present but are capable of switching to fermentation if oxygen is absent. Their resistance to the presence of oxygen makes them easier to work with during dark fermentation. In addition, a high partial pressure in the reactor does not affect the fermentation yield. This group includes Enterobacteriaceae, a large family of Gram-negative bacteria which do not form spores [195]. Enterobacteriaceae include Arsenophonus, Branneria, Buchnera, Budvicia, Buttiauxella, Cedecea, Citrobacter, Cronobacter, Dickeya, Edwardsiella, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Escherichia, Ewingella, Hafnia, Klebsiella, Kluyvera, Coserella, Leclercia, Leminorella, Moellerella, Morganella, Obesumbacterium, Pantoea, Pectobacterium, Photorhabdus, Plesiomonas, Pragia, Proteus, Providencia, Rahnella, Raoutella, Salmonella, Samsonia, Serratia, Shigella, Sodalis, Tatumella, Thorsellia, Trabulsiella, Wiglesworhtia, Xenorhabdus, Yersinia, and Yokenella. Enterobacteriaceae are capable of fermentation, including dark fermentation resulting in the production of hydrogen from 2,3-butanediol and organic acids. However, hydrogen and carbon dioxide are formed through decomposition of formic acid which makes the hydrogen production yield lower than in the case of using Clostridium [5]. The best known metabolic pathway in this group of microorganisms is glucose metabolism resulting in formation of hydrogen. This pathway was studied for E. coli. The maximum theoretical hydrogen yield is 2 mol of H2 per mole of glucose. The other final products of glucose metabolism are butyric, lactic, and formic acids, as well as ethanol in small amounts. The formation of acetic acid generates ATP [69]. Aerobic bacteria Bacillus or Alcaligenes can also be used for the production of hydrogen by fermentation; however, at this time there is little interest in this method. Bacteria from a genus Bacillus, similarly to Clostridium, are Gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria, able to produce hydrogen by fermentation and a mixture of organic acids in fermentation broth. Most commonly used bacteria in for hydrogen production by dark fermentation include Bacillus macerans (acetoethylicus), Bacillus cloacae, Bacillus macerans, Bacillus licheniformis, and Bacillus polymyxa."
10,Mixed bacterial cultures. Methods of preparation and enrichment of inoculum,"5.2 Mixed bacterial cultures. Methods of preparation and enrichment of inoculum It is possible to produce hydrogen from various substrates during dark fermentation using both pure and mixed bacterial cultures. However, the use of a monoculture to produce hydrogen is of research significance, despite higher yields as demonstrated by numerous investigations carried out mainly with Gram-positive Clostridium and Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae. Although many investigations have been carried out in a batch mode using glucose or other simple carbohydrates as a substrate and bacterial monocultures, in practice fermentation has to be performed in a continuous mode using mixed cultures on a substrate being organic waste or pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. Under such conditions, sterilization of the substrate is too expensive and energy-consuming. Pure bacterial cultures are sensitive to contamination with other culture, including bacteria consuming hydrogen in their metabolic processes. Utilization of mixed cultures is particularly important in hydrogen production by fermentation on an industrial scale. Mixed bacterial cultures capable of hydrogen production abundantly occur in municipal sewage, composts and organic waste from which they can be isolated. Advantages of this approach include no need for aseptic environment, which is necessary for monocultures, ease of control of the process and a wider variety of available substrates [196,197]. On the downside, mixed cultures in addition to hydrogen-producing microorganisms also contain bacteria consuming hydrogen in their metabolic processes. These are mainly methanogens and homoacetogens as well as bacteria reducing sulfur, producing propionic acid, and reducing nitrates [28,196,198–203]. In order to obtain high hydrogen yields, it is necessary to remove them from the culture or to inactivate them so as to limit the processes in which hydrogen is the substrate. There are several methods of inoculum pretreatment which can be classified with respect to their implementation as physical or chemical. Physical methods of inoculum pretreatment include heat-shock, aeration, microwave irradiation, ultrasonication, treatment with infrared, ultraviolet and gamma radiation, freezing and thawing, while chemical methods make use of acids or bases as well as growth inhibitors of microorganisms consuming hydrogen, such as 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES), 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (BESA), iodopropane, chloroform, higher fatty acids, especially linoleic acid, or acetylene. These processes aim at elimination of bacteria sensitive to extreme conditions, which do not form endospores, such as hydrogentrophs and especially methanogens [136]. None of the physical methods mentioned above is universal, ensuring a high hydrogen production yield. Inocula originating from different sources require different pretreatment methods, which was the subject of numerous investigations [204–210]. Pretreatment methods also inhibit strains of bacteria not forming spores and producing hydrogen, such as Enterobacter, resulting in a lower hydrogen yield compared with inoculum that had not been pretreated [201]. A. The heat-shock method is most common and involves treating the culture with a high temperature. The methods of heat pretreatment of inoculum can be carried out in several ways, i.e. by heating, boiling, autoclaving or drying. High temperature, usually 80–121 °C, kills non spore forming bacteria. As a result, spores capable of forming bacteria survive, especially Clostridium and Bacillus, but also acetic acid bacteria, propionic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria. On the other hand, such conditions kill methanogens as well as not forming spores Enterobacter or Citrobacter, which produce hydrogen. A typical example of using heat-shock as an inoculum pretreatment method is presented in a paper by Wang and Wan [211]. Digested sludge containing microorganisms is heated at 100 °C for 15 min. Thus prepared inoculum was used in dark fermentation and the maximum hydrogen production potential obtained was 215.4 cm3/g glucose, which was much higher than that for untreated inoculum (65.6 cm3/g glucose). The conversion of the substrate to products was also much higher (by 10%). A more complicated method was used by Logan et al. [90] who heat-shocked inoculum taken from soils used for tomato plants by drying 1-cm thick sample layers at 104 °C in an aluminum pan for 2 h. Samples were then sieved using a #20 mesh (850 µm) and stored at 4 °C. Thus prepared samples were used as the reactor inoculum for dark fermentation. The hydrogen yield obtained was 0.92 mol H2/ mol glucose (125 cm3/g glucose) and the conversion of the substrate amounted to 23%. Another modification of the heat-shock method is described [129], the hydrogen generating microflora was isolated from the cow dung, the pH was adjusted to 5 and after 3 h was subjected to heat treatment at 105 °C for 2 h. Heat-shock aims at eliminating microorganisms that consume hydrogen, thus enriching inoculum in the strains producing hydrogen which results in a higher yield of dark fermentation. A significant number of the investigations making use of heat-shock results in an increase of hydrogen yield which would indicate a selective enrichment of inoculum in hydrogen-producing bacteria [200,203]. However, not only hydrogen producing bacteria (HPB) are capable of surviving heat-shock. Bacterial strains responsible for the production of volatile fatty acids and those taking part in reduction of sulfates are also able to survive this type of treatment [212]. Zhu and Béland observed a decrease in the hydrogen production yield with the simultaneous increase in concentration of butyric acid after heat-shocking an inoculum compared to untreated inoculum [213]. A digested sludge was boiled for 20 min, which lowered the fermentation yield from 5.17 to 2.59 mmol H2/mol sucrose. This pretreatment method resulted in a complete repression of methanogenic activity. B. Freezing and thawing is another inoculum pretreatment method playing the same role as heat-shock. It involves freezing inoculum and maintaining it at temperatures between − 25 °C to − 10 °C, followed by thawing and incubating at 20 – 30 °C. Even though the method is considered to enrich inoculum mainly in hydrogen producing bacteria, the hydrogen yield reported in a number of studies is not impressive ( Table 8). Liu et al. [206] observed that Lactobacillus sp. is resistant to this type of treatment and since it is known to have an inhibitory effect on HPB, the hydrogen production was lowered by 15% compared with the untreated inoculum. The freezing-thawing method was also used in paper [214]. Kotay and Das subjected sewage sludge to two freezing-thawing cycles. The inoculum was frozen and stored at − 20 °C for 6 h and then heated to 25 °C and the microorganisms incubated for 6 h. Thus pretreated inoculum was used for dark fermentation resulting in the hydrogen yield of 7 cm3 H2/g COD. No methanogenesis was observed in contrast with the fermentation carried out without inoculum pretreatment. C. Another well studied pretreatment method is aeration. The principle of the method relies on the use of oxygen present in the air to eliminate from mixed cultures the bacteria sensitive to oxygen, including those responsible for hydrogen consumption. It is assumed that methanogens are obligate anaerobes; therefore, oxygen supplied with the air is toxic to them. Inhibition of methanogens results in a higher yield of produced hydrogen [196]. In spite of several studies [211,215] reporting that the method brings about a substantial increase in hydrogen yield, the results of research on inoculum aeration obtained by a number of research groups [149,151,153] are ambiguous. This method is controversial, especially considering the fact that also hydrogen-producing bacteria from the genus Clostridium are obligate anaerobes and hence their growth in the presence of oxygen is inhibited [28]. In addition, Lactobacillus sp. are resistant to oxygen and their inhibition of the growth of HBP affects the yield of produced hydrogen. One of the examples of lowered hydrogen yield are the results reported by Zhu and Béland [213]. The authors prepared inoculum by 30-min aeration of a sample taken from digested wastewater sludge containing mixed cultures. Following 12-h incubation, the bacteria were transferred to the sample bottle. The hydrogen yield was 4.84 mol H2/mol sucrose which was worse by 0.33 mol/mol sucrose than the yield of hydrogen obtained for the untreated inoculum. D. Acid and alkaline treatment of inoculum. The growth of methanogens and methanogenesis processes can be inhibited and an increase in hydrogen production yield accomplished by pretreating inoculum with acids or bases may be achieved. The treatment involves adjustment of pH of inoculum to a value at which microorganisms cannot survive. For an acidic medium it is a pH in the order of 2–4 while for an alkaline medium it ranges from 10 to 12. Such conditions should eliminate microorganisms not forming endospores, especially methanogens, for which the optimum pH ranges from 6.7 to 7.5 [216]. However, both the propionic and acetic acid bacteria are resistant to acidic and basic media. For example, Ren et al. [209] observed an increase in concentration of propionic acid during fermentation using an acid-treated inoculum. Optimum conditions for acid and alkaline pretreatment have been studied in a number of papers. For acid pretreatment, sulfuric, hydrochloric or nitric acid at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 6 M were used most often [92,204,217] whereas in the case of bases it is generally NaOH at a concentration from 1 to 6 M [121,215]. Acid and alkaline pretreatment is used to prepare inoculum and later in a digester to maintain hydrogenic properties of bacteria. The optimum pH depends on the kind of bacteria occurring in a culture. Chaganti et al. [204] adjusted pH of anaerobic inoculum from the ethanol manufacturing facility, containing Archea as well as mixed cultures of bacteria Bacteroidaceae, Clostridiaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Geobacteriaceae, and Methylobacteriaceae, Baccilaceae, to 3.0 using 2.0 M HCl, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. The hydrogen yield obtained in dark fermentation of glucose containing broth was 1.5 mol H2/mol glucose which was twice as high as for the untreated inoculum. Furthermore, no methane was found in the biogas in contrast with control (0.4 mol CH4/mol glucose. Mu et al. [92] also used acid- and alkaline-treatment in their investigations on suppression of methanogenesis in mixed cultures and enrichment of hydrogen-producing inoculum. For the acid-treatment, the anaerobic sludge from the soybean-processing wastewater treatment plant was adjusted to pH 3–4 with 0.1 N HCl for 24 h, and then was adjusted back to pH 7 with 0.1 N NaOH. The hydrogen yield for the acid-treated inoculum was 1.3 mol H2/mol glucose. Cai et al. [102] examined the effectiveness of alkaline pretreatment by adjusting the pH of inoculum from the sewage sludge of the aeration tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant to 12 using 4.0 M NaOH, followed by thermostatting at 25 °C for 24 h. The hydrogen fermentation was carried out at pH 11 using the sewage sludge as the substrate. It was found that dark fermentation using alkaline-treated inoculum provided the highest hydrogen yield (16.59 cm3 H2/g substrate), which is a substantial improvement compared to untreated inoculum (9.13 cm3 H2/g substrate). In the latter case, a decrease in hydrogen yield was observed after ca. 28 h due to hydrogen consumption by bacteria capable of utilizing hydrogen in their metabolic pathways. However, these are not methanogens since methane was absent in the generated biogas. E. The next inoculum pretreatment method is chemical treatment. Chemical compounds are able to block metabolic pathways of methanogenic bacteria selectively. Compounds such as 2-bromoethanesulfonate (2-BES) or 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (2-BESA) are believed to be chemical analogs of coenzyme M required for methyl-transfer reactions. The complex methyl-coenzyme M is reduced by its reductase to methane. The inhibitor reacts with the methyl group binding it instead of CoM which prevents the formation of methane. In practice, either inhibition or a substantial reduction of methane formation is observed along with an improvement in the hydrogen production yield [218,219]. However, the results of investigations carried out by various research groups [145,151,153] are not unambiguous. In addition an increase in hydrogen yield was observed in several examples of chemical pretreatment, whereas there are others, which suggest that these compounds are not effective in improving hydrogen production yield as shown in Table 8. Pendyala et al. [207] investigated inoculum of anaerobic mixed cultures pretreatment with BESA and linoleic acid and found the presence of acetic acid bacteria Eubacterium aerofaciens, sulfate reducing bacteria Desulfuromonas acetoxidans as well as typical methanogens Methylophilus methylotrophus and others consuming hydrogen in the fermentation broth. Zhu and Béland [213] examined various pretreatment methods, including addition of BESA and inoculum originating from digested anaerobic sludge from a wastewater treatment plant. The BESA pretreatment was carried out by adding the inhibitor to the sludge at a concentration of 10 mmol and maintaining at room temperature for 30 min. This pretreatment method did not improve the hydrogen yield but completely inhibited the activity of methanogenic microorganisms. The hydrogen production yield with sucrose as a substrate was 5.28 mol H2/mol sucrose [213]. Chloroform is also used for inoculum pretreatment. Its mechanism of action is similar to that of BES and BESA. Chloroform has the ability to limit the inhibiting activity of propionic acid bacteria [215]. Thus, a number of investigations testing the effectiveness of chloroform at various concentrations, usually from 0.005% to 5% over 17–24 h was carried out [210,215,217]. However, also in this case the results are ambiguous. In addition to the results of investigations demonstrating an increase in hydrogen production, there are others reporting lowered yields (Table 8). Some researchers [210,217] suggest that the reason for lowered yields is the side effect of chloroform resulting in inhibition of hydrogen producing bacteria ( Tables 9 and 10). Hu et al. [217] demonstrated that an effective method of pretreatment of methanogenic granules is the use of chloroform. The authors varied the concentration of chloroform from 0.05% to 2.5%. By using a chloroform concentration of 0.05% it was possible to decrease the amount of methane released during fermentation from 75.76 to 0.04 cm3 CH4/g glucose. At the same time, the volume of hydrogen produced was 135.09 cm3 H2/g glucose, which is a good result considering the fact that the amount of hydrogen produced for control was 0.42 cm3 H2/g glucose. Higher concentrations of the inhibitor have a negative effect on fermentation yield; complete inhibition of hydrogen producing bacteria was observed for 2.5% (v/v) concentration of chloroform. Higher fatty acids, such as linoleic, caprylic, caproic, palmitic, lauric, oleic and myristic [141,157], are used in inoculum pretreatment. Their inhibitory activity involves hindering bacterial growth and activity of methanogens by adsorption of fatty acids onto the cell membrane. Among the fatty acids used for this purpose, linoleic acid was the one studied most. Chaganti et al. [204] treated anaerobic inoculum containing Archea and mixed cultures of Bacteroidaceae, Bacillaceae; Clostridiaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Geobacteriaceae, and Methylobacteriaceae with linoleic acid at 37 °C for 24 h. After treatment, a pH was adjusted to 5.5 using 1 M HCI or 1 M NaOH. The hydrogen production yield using glucose as the substrate was 1.70 mol H2 /mol glucose, which was higher than in the case of heat shock or acid or alkaline pretreatment. F. Other methods. Many more inoculum pretreatment methods than those discussed here have been reported. A comprehensive review on this topic was published in 2015 [220]. The other inoculum pretreatment methods included: ultrasounds [221,222], gamma irradiation [223], infrared radiation [224] as well as chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and their chlorinated derivatives: acetylene, iodopropane, ethylene, cyclopentadiene, cycloheptatriene, benzene, toluene, isoprene, 1-hexyne, ethane, methyl chloride and fluoride [219,225,226], and nitrates [205]. Inoculum pretreatment methods involving application of several procedures in succession, including heat-shock, aeration, chemical, acid and alkaline and ultrasounds, have also been tested [28,218]. Depending on the pretreatment method, inoculum will contain live bacteria with an enhanced ability for lactic acid, acetic acid or ethanol fermentation. However, the treatment of the next generations of bacteria can be a problem. The solution to this problem is likely to use genetic engineering to create mutants with blocked selected metabolic pathways. A promising trend involves molecular biology methods applied to search, selection, isolation and identification of new hydrogen producing bacteria from natural environments. Biomass pretreatment methods affect the accuracy of the process, as achieving high degrees of solubilization of hemicelluloses and/or lignin unavoidably leads to degradation of the solubilized fragments as a result of the severe conditions they are exposed to. The amount and nature of the formed degradation products, many of which are inhibitory to downstream biocatalytic processes, is directly related to the pretreatment method and conditions."
11,Temperature,"5.3 Temperature Fermentation temperature is another important parameter affecting the growth rate of bacteria and the efficiency of conversion of the substrates to hydrogen. Bacteria can be classified into several temperature groups for which the maximum yield of produced hydrogen falls into temperature ranges suitable for the growth conditions of psychrophiles (0–25 °C), mesophiles (25–45 °C), thermophiles (45–65 °C), extreme thermophiles (65–80 °C) and hyperthermophiles (above 80 °C) [227]. Selection of the optimum temperature depends on the kind of bacteria used during fermentation, both for pure cultures and mixtures. The activity of specific enzymes responsible for hydrogen fermentation depends upon the temperature for which it can take an optimum value. A temperature lower or higher than optimal decreases the activity of enzymes. Hence, the optimum fermentation temperature depends on the type of bacteria and the kind of substrate used. Readily biodegradable substrates are converted most efficiently under mesophilic conditions [82]. A lag time is shorter for mesophilic conditions which is due to a smaller population of thermophiles compared with mesophiles in the inoculum [229]. In a study by Pakarinen et al. [229] it was found the highest hydrogen yield was obtained for the process carried out at 70 °C but the time of reaching the maximum yield was longer than in the experiments performed at 35 °C and 50 °C. It is believed thermophilic and extreme thermophilic conditions work better with the substrates which undergo hydrolysis during fermentation. Higher temperatures increase the activity of the enzymes responsible for hydrolysis [99,197,230]. It is also believed [28] that the higher yield under thermophilic conditions can be attributed to a lower solubility of gases in water. High concentration of a gas can inhibit bacterial growth. However, using higher temperatures and mixed cultures can result in impoverishment of diversity of bacterial strains and thus a less complete degradation of substrates. This is particularly detrimental during fermentation of wastewater and wastes rich in organic matter of various origin and chemical structures [231]. Another limitation in using high temperatures are economic aspects [232]. The use of thermophilic conditions can be economically justified due to higher hydrogen yields and usage of more complex substrates [233] but extreme thermophilic and hyperthermophilic conditions require supplying considerable quantities of energy which lowers profitability of the process. Azbar et al. [76] investigated the effect of mesophilic and thermophilic conditions on the yield of hydrogen and organic acids by fermenting cheese whey wastewater as the substrate. Conversion of the substrate to hydrogen at 55 °C was lower than at 35 °C, being equal to 8.1 mmol H2/g COD and 9.2 mmol H2/g COD, respectively. Severalfold higher concentrations of volatile fatty acids were observed under thermophilic conditions. Zhang and Shen [234] reported that in mixed cultures of Clostridium pasteuranium the production of hydrogen ceased when the temperature reached 45 °C. A temperature of 35 °C was found to be optimal for the production of hydrogen. On the other hand, Yokoyama et al. [235] found that within the range of applied temperatures 37–85 °C there are two maxima of hydrogen production: at 60 °C the hydrogen yield is 392 cm3 H2/dm3 substrate while at 75 °C the yield amounts to 248 cm3 H2/ dm3 substrate. At 85 °C the fermentation process does not occur. The production of methane was observed at temperatures 37 °C and 50 °C. A few studies on dark fermentation have been reported under psychrophilic conditions (ca. 4–20 °C) [236,237]."
12,pH,"5.4 pH Concentration of hydronium ions plays an important role in dark fermentation processes since it affects the hydrogen production yield. The pH value directly impacts the activity of various strains occurring in a mixed culture, the metabolic pathways of microorganisms as well as their morphology and cell structure [240]. All enzymes participating in metabolic processes of bacteria are active in a certain pH range, reaching maximum activity at the optimum pH value [241]. This includes the enzyme hydrogenase. For mixed bacterial cultures a low pH inhibits methanogenic microorganisms consuming hydrogen. The control of pH and maintaining it at a constant, optimal level is also important during the fermentation process. This is necessary because the production of hydrogen is accompanied by the formation of organic acids (acetic, lactic, butyric and propionic) which lower the pH of the medium thus inhibiting the activity of the enzymes responsible for the production of hydrogen [216]. A low pH (below 5) also limits the ability of bacteria to maintain the intracellular pH at an appropriate level [242]. Despite the importance of maintaining the pH at a constant, optimal level, a number of investigations, especially those carried out in a batch mode, have been performed without pH control. In such cases, researchers examined the effect of initial pH on the hydrogen fermentation yield. Li and Chen [243] investigated the effect of initial pH from 4 to 8 on the hydrogen yield obtained from steam-exploded corn straw in a batch mode. The results indicated that the optimum pH ranged from 7 to 7.5. However, it should be noted that the medium undergoes pH changes during fermentation without pH control which can significantly affect the hydrogen yield and thus the conclusions can be misleading. In batch processes taking place in fermenters, one should distinguish between the initial and operational pH during the production of biohydrogen [231]. It should be kept in mind that the optimum initial and operational pH values depend on the kind of strain or source of mixed bacterial cultures. Moreover, some investigations indicate that the kind of substrate used can also affect the optimum pH although this is not unequivocal [244]. In general, the optimum pH for the fermentative production of hydrogen ranges from 5.0 to 7.0, which corresponds to the pH range that is favorable for bacterial growth [196]. Guo et al. [230] reported that the neutral pH is optimal for livestock waste, a pH 6.5–7 is appropriate for crop waste, and a pH from 5 to 6 is best for food waste. Liu and Shen [177] investigated the effect of pH ranging from 4 to 9 on the hydrogen production yield by mixed bacterial cultures using starch as the substrate. The highest hydrogen yields were obtained for a pH of 7 and 8, equal to 103 and 120 ml H2/g substrate, respectively. At pH= 4 the hydrogen fermentation did not take place. Similar observations were reported [246]. The authors obtained a maximum hydrogen yield at pH = 7 using C. acetobutylicum NCIMBI 13357. High organic content wastewater from brewery fermentation allowed to obtain the highest hydrogen yield of 1.41 [mol/mol hexose] for a pH equal to 5.5 [131]. Tapia-Venegas et al. [246] used a pH control system during hydrogen fermentation carried out in a continuous mode and obtained the highest hydrogen yield at pH = 5.5 (2.7 mol H2/mol glucose). Vijayaraghavan and Ahmad [129] established that the optimum pH for the production of hydrogen by dark fermentation of palm oil mill effluent was 5.0. Won et al. [247] used mixed cultures for fermentation of sugar refinery wastewater and observed the maximum hydrogen yield and productivity at a pH 5.5. pH strongly affects not only the hydrogen production yield but also the kind and concentration of other metabolites, especially liquid organic compounds [248,249]. Fang and Liu [87] investigated the effect of pH on the concentration of by-products of bacterial metabolism. It was found that at low pH values, these are mainly acetic and butyric acids whereas an increase in pH resulted in higher concentrations of ethanol, propionic and lactic acids. A different relationship was observed [180] during investigation of an influence of pH on the yield of hydrogen and other metabolites in a continuous mode using mixed anaerobic cultures and rice winery wastewater as the substrate. The effluent composition was strongly dependent on pH value. At pH = 4 the propionic acid and ethanol contents in the effluent were 40% and 26%, respectively. Concentrations of both substances decreased with an increase in pH to 6.0, accounting for 20% and 13% of the effluent products. At the same time, the percentages of both acetic and butyric acids increased with pH, from 18% and 15%, respectively, at pH 4.0–38% and 29% at pH 6.0. The hydrogen yield reached its maximum, 1.74 mol H2/mol hexose, at pH 5.5; below and above this value the yield was lower. Interesting results were obtained by Wang et al. [250], who carried out fermentation at various pH values using untreated methanogenic sludge or heat-pretreated sludge. For heat-pretreated inoculum, the ethanol-type fermentation was important at a pH less than 3.6, for pH ranging from 4 to 5.6 the main fermentation product is butyric acid and for pH values between 5.6 and 6 the main fermentation product is acetic acid. In the case of untreated inoculum, at pH values below 4, the predominant fermentation product is caproic acid, for a pH ranging from 4.5 to 5.1 the main product is butyric acid and for pH values between 5.6 and 6 it is acetic acid. The maximum hydrogen yield (1.51 and 1.19 mol H2/mol glucose) and production rate for both untreated and heat-pretreated inoculum were obtained for pH = 4.00. The investigations using a pure culture of Clostridium butyricum revealed that at a low pH the main organic fermentation products are ethanol and butyric acid whereas at pH values above 6 the main products are lactic and formic acids. The maximum hydrogen yield was obtained for pH = 5 [251]. During fermentation of glucose by C. Pasteurianum at a pH below 5, the main fermentation products were butanol and acetone [252]."
13,Hydraulic retention time,"5.5 Hydraulic retention time Production of hydrogen on an industrial scale requires utilization of semi-continuous and continuous processes. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) is an important parameter affecting the hydrogen yield in such processes. Hydraulic retention time is a measure of the average length of time that a substrate remains in a fermentation chamber. HRT has a large impact on the hydrogen productivity during dark fermentation carried out in a continuous or semi-continuous mode. The hydrogen production rate increases over a certain range of HRT values but after exceeding the optimal HRT value the production rate decreases with an increase in HRT [253]. The optimal HRT value depends on the kind of substrate used in dark fermentation and, more specifically, on its biodegradability [82]. During continuous culture growth, the hydraulic retention time is usually gradually refined from long to short intervals to allow the acclimatization of microorganisms to new environments and to prevent the bacteria of interest to be washed away. As a result of the HRT shift, the microbial population dynamically changes, leading to the disappearance of certain species, while others appear [254]. Using a short HRT with CSTR reactors can result in a removal of slowly growing methanogens. It also allows the use of smaller reactors, thus reducing the equipment cost [68]. It is possible to adjust HRT in dark fermentation to limit or eliminate the activity of bacteria utilizing hydrogen in their metabolic processes by making use of differences in growth rate of hydrogen producers and consumers [39]. For simple carbohydrates the optimal HRT is usually several hours: 4 h [253], 2 h [255] or 12 h [246]. In order to find the optimal HRT for dark fermentation of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, Zahedi et al. [107] carried out the process in a semi-continuous mode with various HRTs ranging from 6 h to 10 days. For this kind of substrate, the highest hydrogen production rate of 5.66 dm3 H2/dm3/d was obtained for an HRT = 12 h. The only liquid products were acetic and butyric acids. For longer hydraulic retention times, the presence of propionic and caproic acids was also observed. Massanet – Nicolau et al. [256] found that the optimal HRT for hydrogen production from sewage biosolids was 24 h. Under these conditions, stable hydrogen production has been achieved after three days. Ottaviano et al. [257] used an AFBR reactor to continuously produce hydrogen under thermophilic conditions (55 °C) from cheese whey powder solution. The HRT was changed from 8 to 0,5 h at a fixed substrate concentration. The hydrogen production rate (HPR) increased with decreasing of HRT and the maximum hydrogen production rate obtained was 4.1 ± 0.2 dm3 H2/h/ dm3 for the HRT of 0,5 h. The maximum hydrogen yield was of 3.67 ± 0,59 mol H2/mol lactose for HRT of 4 h. Liu et al. [33] reported increase of HPR from 2.25 ± 0.58 dm3 H2/d/ dm3 to 11.39 ± 1.39 dm3 H2/d/ dm3 with the decrease of HRT from 4 to 1 h. In the process, beverage wastewater was used as a substrate. Veeravalli et al. [258] studied the influence of HRT on the hydrogen production from a steam exploded switchgrass liquor. A hydrogen yield increased to from 2.56 ± 0.10 mol H2/mol hexose with decreasing of HRT from 12 to 6 h. An increase of hydrogen yield from 0.03 to 0.06 mmol H2/g COD with the reduction of HRT from 8 to 4 h was observed during hydrogen production from cassava processing wastewater [259]. Further reduction of HRT to 2 h caused decrease of the hydrogen yield. The authors explain it by the acclimation of methanogenic archea and stabilizing of methane production. It was revealed [180] that an increase in HRT from 2 to 24 h resulted in an increase in hydrogen yield from 1.74 to 2.14 mol H2/ mol glucose which was due to conversion of a larger amount of the substrate into hydrogen. However, this was accompanied by a drop in hydrogen production rate from 8.02 dm3 H2/g VSS/d for 2 h to 1.40 dm3 H2/g VSS/d for 24 h. Hydraulic retention time also affects the concentration of hydrogen in the biogas produced [260]. A change in HRT from 16 to 20 h resulted in an increase in hydrogen concentration in the biogas by 1.8% (from 35.8% to 37.6%). The key H2 producing bacteria such as Clostridium sp. tend to produce in addition to H2 also VFA (acetic and butyric acid) in the exponential growth phase and pass to generate alcohol during the steady-state phase [29]. An increase in hydrogen production rate with a decrease in HRT can also be accompanied by a drop in yield of such metabolites as volatile organic compounds from ca. 8000 mg/dm3 VFA for HRT = 2 days to below 3000 mg/dm3 for HRT = 0.5 day [111]. It is preferable to establish HRT so that useful microorganisms can be maintained in the exponential phase. Sweet sorghum was fermented in a CSTR and obtained a maximum production rate (2550 ml H2/d) for an HRT equal to 6 h; on the other hand, the highest yield (10.4 dm3 H2/kg sweet sorghum) was achieved for an HRT= 12 h [261]. Chen and Lin [262] reported that a decrease in HRT from 13.3 to 3 h caused an increase in the production rate of hydrogen from sucrose from 4.9 l per day to 26.9 l per day. HRT below 3 h had a negative effect on hydrogen yield. It is generally understood that short HRT inhibits hydrogen activity, because the rate of proliferation of the participating microorganisms is significantly lower than that of H2 producing bacteria. This is why at short HRTs growth kinetic control should be carried out in such a way that undesirable bacteria such as propionic acid and methane producers cannot compete with the dilution effect [29]."
14,Partial pressure of hydrogen,"5.6 Partial pressure of hydrogen The partial pressure of hydrogen is the next important parameter affecting hydrogen production. During production of hydrogen the enzyme hydrogenase oxidizes and reduces ferredoxin in a reversible process. Depending on thermodynamics of the reaction, an increase in partial pressure of hydrogen can favor the reduction of ferredoxin which inhibits further conversion of the substrate to hydrogen. When the partial pressure of hydrogen increases, the synthesis of hydrogen decreases while the concentrations of other products of metabolism such as lactic acid, ethanol, acetone, butanol and others increase [69,82]. Thus, it is essential to remove hydrogen as it is formed in order to maintain its high and constant production rate. At present, there are several methods of lowering hydrogen pressure in a reactor and, consequently, the concentration of hydrogen dissolved in a liquid medium. The simplest method involves stirring the medium during fermentation. Chou et al. [266] tested various stirring speeds in the process carried out in a 100 L reactor. An increase in stirring speed from 20 rpm to 100 rpm was found to improve the hydrogen production rate from 35 to 214 (cm3 H2/g TVS/d). Lowering the partial pressure of hydrogen can also be accomplished by sparging the fermentation mixture with an inert gas, usually nitrogen. Mizunio et al. [267] used nitrogen sparging to enhance hydrogen production from glucose, obtaining an increase in hydrogen yield from 0.85 to 1.43 mol H2/ mol glucose and production rate from 1.434 to 3.126 cm3/min/g biomass]. At the same time, the percentage of hydrogen in the biogas was lowered from 53.4% to 5.3%. Massanet – Nicolau et al. [256] used nitrogen to sparge the bioreactor for hydrogen production from sewage biosolids and found that the hydrogen production was sustained for a period of more than 12 days with a yield of 27.0 dm3 H2/kg VS. Kim et al. [268] used nitrogen and carbon dioxide to sparge the reactor at various flow rates (100, 200, 300 and 400 cm3/min). The use of carbon dioxide was found to be more effective than nitrogen. The best performance was obtained by CO2 sparged at 300 cm3/min, resulting in the highest hydrogen yield of 1.68 mol H2 /mol hexoseconsumed compared to nitrogen sparging which yielded 0.95 mol H2 /mol hexoseconsumed. The use of a sparging gas had an effect on the content of other metabolites formed during the fermentation process. For both nitrogen and CO2 the concentration of butyric acid increased while the concentrations of acetic and propionic acids decreased, although the effect was more pronounced for CO2. Veeravalli et al. [258] showed that a combination of nitrogen sparging with linoleic of acid treatment was more beneficial in increasing the hydrogen yield with comparing to a single factor. The results showed that nitrogen sparging together with pretreating the culture increased the hydrogen yield to maximum of 2.56 ± 0.10 mol H2/ mol hexose when the reactor was operated at HRT equal 6 h. Even though the use of a sparging gas improves the hydrogen yield, the final product is diluted and the cost of its recovery can be substantial. Therefore, an improvement of hydrogen yield may not compensate the cost of hydrogen recovery and the cost of sparging the reactor. Removal of the gaseous phase from the reactor is an effective method of lowering the partial pressure of hydrogen. Lee et al. [269] lowered the concentration of dissolved hydrogen by using a vacuum pump. The authors investigated the effect of changes in hydrogen pressure on the yield and production rate of hydrogen as well as the changes in composition of liquid organic metabolites. A significant improvement in hydrogen production rate (from 0.348 to 0.376 mol H2/dm3/h) was found upon lowering the hydrogen pressure from 760 to 380 mmHg. The change in pressure also affected the concentrations of metabolites formed. The concentration of butyric acid increased by 9% with the simultaneous decrease in concentrations of acetic and propionic acids by 4.1% and 4.2%, respectively. Mandal et al. [270] lowered the partial pressure of hydrogen over the fermentation medium from 760 mm Hg to 380 mm Hg and observed an increase in the hydrogen yield from 1.9 to 3.9 mol H2/mol glucose. The maximum production rate of hydrogen was found at a lowered pressure and amounted to 0.017 mmol H2/h/dm3. An alternative solution is the removal of hydrogen by using active membranes highly selective to hydrogen. Examples of application of this type of solution are provided in papers by Teplyakov et al. [271] and Nielsen et al. [272]. These authors investigated reactors equipped with membrane systems using polyvinyltrimethylsilane [203] and palladium-silver membranes [204]. A disadvantage of using membranes is the formation and growth of biofilms containing methanogenic microorganisms [230]. Despite the availability of a variety of techniques for lowering the partial pressure of hydrogen, further research is needed to develop an effective and inexpensive method of hydrogen pressure control."
15,Reactors used in dark fermentation,"The fundamental classification of reactors used for fermentation is based on the mode of implementation of the process, i.e. batch, semi-continuous and continuous. Batch reactors are the simplest reactors used primarily in the laboratory for preliminary investigations on the selection of optimum conditions for dark fermentation [69]. The reactors have a simple and inexpensive design; fermentation parameters, especially temperature and pH, can be controlled in a convenient way. However, the production of hydrogen on an industrial scale requires the use of continuous reactors, due to higher expectable process efficiencies. The continuous reactors usually start in batch mode to ensure the proper inoculum preparation and its pretreatment. The successful transition to continuous mode operation is highly influenced by the start – up strategy [254]. The most commonly used bioreactor configurations are continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTR), upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB), anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) and membrane bioreactor (MBR)."
16,Continuously stirred-tank reactor,"6.1 Continuously stirred-tank reactor The reactors most commonly used for continuous fermentation are continuously stirred-tank reactors (CSTR). The reactors are cylindrical in shape and are equipped with a mechanical stirring system. The feedstock is fed to the reactor and the effluent removed from it in a continuous or sequential mode. Dimensions of this type of reactors are much smaller than those of conventional fermenters used for the production of methane due to short hydraulic retention times [231]. The CSTR reactors are commonly used owing to their simple design, easy adjustment of operating conditions, stirring that facilitates homogeneous conditions of the medium and provides a good contact of microorganisms with substrates [68,273]. Stirring also provides an effective control of conditions (pH, temperature) inside the reactor. Continuous stirring improves the effectiveness of removal of hydrogen from the reaction mixture which lowers its partial pressure and raises the hydrogen production yield. In contrast to typical fermenters, in CSTRs bacteria are better suspended in a liquid medium. However, the reactor also has a number of drawbacks. The main parameters during the CSTR operation are HRT and organic loading rate. The concentration of biomass in the reaction mixture is limited as a result of its retention time which is identical to HRT. This has an undisputed effect on the hydrogen production rate [196]. During its operation there is a problem with biomass removal and the bacteria are incapable of activity at high dilutions [69]. HRT must be less than the maximum growth rate of microorganisms used [273]. The hydrogen production rates in CSTR reactors are not high when using short HRTs. A diagram showing the general idea of a CSTR reactor is shown in Fig. 3 [267]. In a paper by Mizuno et al. [267] a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), similar to (1) in Fig. 3, with a working volume of 2.3 dm3 was used. The reactor was equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a pH control system and a water jacket. Fermentation was carried out at 35 oC at pH = 6.0. Liquid and gaseous samples, collected through sampling ports, eg. (2) and (3) in Fig. 3 were analyzed. Krishnan et al. [274] investigated the two – stage process for the hydrogen and methane production using palm oil mill effluent as a substrate in a similar bioreactor."
17,Membrane bioreactor,"6.2 Membrane bioreactor A membrane bioreactor (MBR) is a typical reactor used to carry out fermentation processes; however, it is equipped with a membrane or a membrane system. The membranes can be placed outside the reactor (side-stream MBR) using the cross-flow ( Fig. 4) or can be immersed. The latter design is advantageous as it has lower operating costs and the membranes are smaller. The use of a membrane bioreactor eliminates the major drawback of a CSTR reactor which is the elution of biomass. The membrane retains microorganisms inside the reactor which allows maintaining the biomass at a constant, high concentration [196]. The presence of the membrane facilitates selection of an optimal HRT independent of retention time of activated sludge which allows a better control of process parameters [84]. An increase in retention time improves HRT of biomass which consequently improves the rate of conversion of substrates but has a negative effect on the hydrogen production rate. The main disadvantages of membrane bioreactors include fouling of membranes and high operating costs of the side-stream membrane systems. The general idea of membrane bioreactors for the production of hydrogen by dark fermentation is shown in Fig. 4. This type of bioreactor was used by Oh et al. [84] , Palazzi et al. [275], Wu et al. [276], Wu et al. [255], Kumar et al. [277]. A ceramic-aluminum tubular membrane module packed with a 2-L volume of biomass was used. A feedstock to the bioreactor (1) was delivered by means of a pump (2), maintaining a constant liquid level in the reactor, corresponding to a working volume of 1 dm3. In order to adjust the solids retention time, solids were wasted from the reactor intermittently using a timer and a pump. A nutrient solution was fed by a nutrient-dosing pump (3). An alumina membrane was used in the membrane module (4). During the experiments by Oh et al. [84], three different membrane pore sizes: 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 µm were used, and the membrane surface area was 0.0055 m2. A constant permeate flow was maintained by a circulation loop (5). Periodic backpulsing (every 10–30 s) was used to limit membrane fouling. It was achieved by injecting nitrogen gas in short pulses (0.5–1 s) into the permeate side of the membrane module. The pressure drop across the membrane was measured using manometers P G."
18,Packed - bed bioreactors,"6.3 Packed - bed bioreactors An alternative to CSTRs are packed-bed reactors. In contrast with CSTRs they can be used for conversion of biomass with a high content of organics. They are also characterized by short HRTs without the risk of elution of biomass. The reactor bed can have the form of granules, biofilm or biomass particles bonded to a gel [96]. Typical packed-bed reactors include upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors, anaerobic fluidized-bed reactors (AFBR) and expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactors. In order to optimize the yield of fermentation, various materials with a variety of shapes are tested for immobilization of microorganisms on their surface. Palazzi et al. [275] used a continuous packed column for dark fermentation of starch by Enterobacter aerogenes, in which the bacteria were immobilized on fragments of spongy structures having dimensions of 5 × 5 × 2 mm and glass granules of 7 mm in diameter. This was to lower a stress reaction of the organisms to stirring and to limit the removal of microbial biomass from the reactor. The highest hydrogen yield obtained in this way was 3.02 mmol H2/mmol glucose. Wu et al. [276] used a packed-bed reactor filled with immobilized-cell beads for dark fermentation of glucose, fructose and sucrose. The maximum hydrogen yield was 0.70 mol H2/mol glucose. Wu et al. [255] used for fermentation immobilized sewage sludge in a three-phase fluidized bed reactor. The sludge was immobilized with a modified alginate gel entrapment method. The cells immobilized in this way protect the bacteria from excessive elution. The maximal hydrogen yield obtained during dark fermentation was 2.67 mol H2/mol sucrose. Kumar et al. [277] examined the effect of shape of lignocellulosic solid matrices with immobilized bacteria Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08 on the hydrogen production rate. Out of the three bed configurations studied, tubular, tapered and rhomboid, the rhomboid bioreactor was found to be most effective. The gas hold-up was reduced by 67% using the rhomboid bioreactor as compared to tubular one. At a glucose concentration equal to 1%, the maximum hydrogen production rate achieved was 75.6 mmol/dm3h, which was 2.1 times higher than that of batch system. 6.3.1 Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor The UASB reactor usually has an elongated shape with a three-phase separator in the upper part of the reactor, in which hydrogen producing granules (HPG) are quickly formed and deposited at the bottom resulting in a thick layer of biomass [278]. The granules are formed and grow during fermentation process through aggregation of activated sludge. Their diameter varies from 0.2 to 2 mm. The advantage of granulated form of microorganisms is their higher retention in the reactor and higher resistance to toxic conditions. The closeness of microorganisms in granules results in a greater conversion of substrates into hydrogen. Bubbles of gas formed during fermentation move upward, causing turbulence in the medium and hence mixing; therefore, mechanical stirring is not used. The feedstock is pumped to the bottom of the reactor. A disadvantage of UASB is a long initiation time when using granulated activated sludge. These reactors can be used for a wide variety of substrates, especially organic wastewater of various origin. Hydrogen production in this type of reactors is highly effective and reproducible. However, the use of UASBs is limited by the long time (even several months) needed for HPG to form [231]. The advantages of UASB reactors include high effectiveness of hydrogen production, short HRT and stable operating conditions. According to Lee et al. [263], the disadvantage of a UASB reactor is its sensitivity to channeling effects which give rise to poor substrate-biomass contact. The general idea of a UASB reactor is shown in Fig. 5. An upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor, marked as (1) in the Fig. 5 with a working volume of 5 dm3, equipped with a water jacket and a three-phase separator (2) was used [279]. Fermentation was carried out at 37 oC. The feedstock to the reactor was palm oil mill effluent (POME) and bacteria immobilized in a PEG polymer. The reactor was loaded with an appropriate amount of PEG-immobilized cells (3) to obtain a final solution of 4–16% w/v. For the first 6 h of fermentation the reactor was operated in batch mode before being switched to continuous mode. Liquid samples were collected during the reactor operation using sampling ports (4) located at various heights of the reactor. Krishnan et al. [274] investigated the two – stage process for the hydrogen and methane production. The first stage was realized in UASB reactor for hydrogen production, the second stage was accomplished with the CSTR reactor for methane production. The well – mixed slurry fluid from the mixing tank was fed into the UASB reactor in 24 h cycles, including 30 min of filling and 22,5 h of reaction time. The effective total volume of UASB reactor was 5 dm3. The feedstock to the reactor was palm oil mill effluent (POME) and heat – treated anaerobic sludge. The dark fermentation was carried out at 55 oC and a pH of 5,5. The effluent from hydrogen production was mixed with untreated anaerobic digestion sludge and flowed to CSTR reactor. The maximum hydrogen production rate from palm oil mill in UASB reactor was reached at 2-days HRT under thermophilic condition. The biogas was composed mainly of H2 and CO2, with concentrations of 55% and 41–47%, respectively. The two identical units of UASB reactors with the working volume of 24 dm3 was used to hydrogen production [280]. The cassava wastewater was fed continuously to the bottom of each UASB reactors at different flow rate. The operating conditions were: 37 oC, pH of 5,5, a recycle ratio of the effluent flow rate to feed flow rate was fixed at 1:1, COD loading rate was from 10 to 30 kg/m3/d. For each COD loading, it took about 10 d to reach a steady state conditions. The effluent from the hydrogen UASB reactors was used as a feed to two UASB methane producing reactors. For the hydrogen production stage, maximum hydrogen production was achieved at a COD loading rate of 25 kg/m3/d and the produced gas contained 36,4% hydrogen and 63,6% carbon dioxide without methane."
19,Anaerobic fluidized bed reactor,"6.4 Anaerobic fluidized bed reactor Reactors of this type combine features of two reactors: CSTR and immobilized-bed reactors. Microorganisms are deposited on a solid surface nas granules or a biofilm. The advantage of an AFBR is a good mass and heat transfer. A gas is fed from the bottom of the reactor to generate a fluidized bed. This affects catalytic activity of the system and thus the degree of degradation of substrates. Since microorganisms are deposited on a solid surface, there is a lower probability of biomass being washed off compared to a UASB reactor. A disadvantage of a AFBR is a higher energy consumption needed to maintain the bed in a fluidized state [281]. Fig. 6 depicts an AFBR used by Zhang et al. [281]. An anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) was used [281]. The main element of the system is a bioreactor, similar to (1) in the Fig. 6 with a three-phase separator (2) installed in the upper part. Glass beads of 5 mm in diameter made a bed (3) located at the reactor bottom to serve as influent distributor. Granular activated carbon was used as the support medium for bacteria (4). The pH was controlled at 4.0 and the reactor was operated at a temperature of 37 oC by a heating blanket. Mixed bacterial cultures were used in fermentation [241]. The system was fed with synthetic wastewater containing glucose and other nutrients. Two AFBR reactors were used to hydrogen production from cassava processing wastewater [258]. The AFBR1 reactor was inoculated with poultry slaughterhouse wastewater (SP) and the AFBR2 reactor was inoculated with swine wastewater (SW). Both types of sludge were thermally pretreated. Prior to be used in the feed, the cassava processing wastewater was acidified and heat pretreated. The recirculation pump was set at 1.3 times the minimum fluidization velocity of the polystyrene particles (0.74 cm/s). The reactors were operated for 142 days. For the first 48 h, the reactors were operated in batch mode to begin the hydrogen production. Then, they were operated in a continuous mode. For the AFBR1 the maximum hydrogen yield was 0.6 mmol H2/g COD and 1.0 mmol H2/g COD for the AFBR2. Ottaviano et al. [257] used two AFBR reactors to continuously produce hydrogen under thermophilic conditions (55 °C) from cheese whey. The AFBR1 reactor was operated in a fixed CW feed concentration decreasing the HRT from 8 to 0.5 h. The AFBR2 reactor was operated in a fixed HRT increasing CW feed concentration from 2800 ± 100–14,600 ± 300 mg lactose/dm3. The total volume of each reactor was 1.98 dm3. The support material for the immobilization of biomass were expanded clay particles. The recycle flow rate was 76.58 dm3/h, bed expansion 30%, the superficial velocity was 1.30 times higher than minimum fluidization velocity. After the batch operation for adaptation of the inoculum to the CW, the reactors were switched to continuous mode. For AFBR1, the maximum hydrogen production was reached for the HRT of 0.5 h. For AFBR2, the maximum hydrogen production was reached at the concentration of 6800 ± 300 mg lactose/dm3. The apparatus used for dark fermentation can also be configured as multistage reactor systems. The most common systems are two-stage ones, in which hydrolysis and fermentation take place separately. Fermentation alone can also be carried out in reactors connected in series [282]. Such a solution allows a greater degree of conversion of the feedstock and improved yield of the process but at the expense of a longer total retention time and higher operating costs of the system. As an example, Han and Shin [283] used sequential batch technique in specially designed reactors to produce hydrogen from food waste. The leaching-bed reactors connected in series operated in batch mode and were rotated. The hydrogen yield in such a multistage system was 0.31 m3/kg VS added. Biohydrogen and methane production from cheese whey in a two-stage anaerobic process has also been investigated [284]. Another approach to hydrogen production is a combination of dark fermentation and photofermentation of organic acids formed in the first stage of dark fermentation."
20,Summary,"The possibility of hydrogen production from renewable resources and from post-production wastes, especially from the agricultural industry, is being extensively investigated. Other approaches, including gasification, pyrolysis, electrolysis of water, magnetolysis, radiolysis, plasmolysis or biophotolysis of water are also being pursued. Waste biomass can be converted to hydrogen by microbiological processes. Especially, dark fermentation is recognized as the most promising method due to its advantages such as relatively low energy demand, the usability of wide range of biomass as a feedstocks and the possibility to integrate with other processes e.g. methane production processes or membrane – based processes. There is a considerable interest in the production of hydrogen from waste lignocellulosic biomass as demonstrated by a number of research and review papers. This research has to be continued in order to develop efficient technologies for hydrogen production. The limitation step of hydrogen production by dark fermentation from biomass waste is the low degree of conversion of the substrate to product. Fast growing trees, such as energy willow or poplar, could be used to produce biohydrogen by dark fermentation after pretreatment. The fermentation process is affected by a number of parameters, including: temperature, pH, hydraulic retention time for continuous processes, partial pressure of hydrogen, kind of microorganisms used and in the case of mixed cultures also the method of inoculum pretreatment. As demonstrated, the composition of a growth medium and optimum concentration of biomass in the feedstock are also important. Bioreactor configuration and operation mode are also significant technological indicators and were discussed in the present paper. Regardless the type of the fermenter, dark fermentation should be conducted in continuous mode rather than in batch system, with special attention paid to the conditions of the start – up strategy. It is crucial to continue additional research and improve the efficiency of hydrogen generation. The possible gain of energy is the main driving force for amelioration concerning the greater reliability and sustainability. Continuous analysis of diversified hydrogen generation approaches may help to identify the deficiencies that hinder infrastructure evolution. Therefore constant tracking of the supporting systems for scale-up and analysis of feedback effects should result in high-potential strategies for widespread deployment of hydrogen technologies."
