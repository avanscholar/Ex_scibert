0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is being produced mostly from conventional sources (steam reforming of natural gas and partial oxidation of hydrocarbons) whereas 4% is being produced from renewable energy sources (solar photovoltaic power for direct conversion, wind power, hydropower) [1]. As an alternative, hydrogen production from coal represents a promising option for the near to medium future [2]. It is worth noting that coal reserves constitute 65% of the world’s main fossil fuel reserves and North America (28%), Russia (25%) and China (13%) enjoy the lion’s share of the world’s coal reserves [3]. Furthermore, the development of technologies for pre-combustion CO2 sequestration and economical hydrogen production is quite important to the hydrogen economy and environmental protection [4]. Indeed, one is reminded that the leading industrial countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol are bound to set the CO2 emission target levels at 6% below the 1990 ones for the time period 2008–2012 [5]. As a result, research activity increasingly focuses on the development of new technology options or the modification of existing ones that would lead to cost-effective strategies for the reduction of CO2 emissions while maximizing H2 production [6]. Within such a context, the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) process is a way to co-produce synthesis gas, electricity, hydrogen, fuels and chemicals from coal and coal/biomass-mix in an environmentally responsible manner. The production of hydrogen via the water–gas shift reaction (WGSR) represents a key part of this process and hydrogen of various purities can be produced in an IGCC plant. Notice that the application of hydrogen separation technology to promote the WGSR is a promising way of making hydrogen from coal and coal/biomass-mix for fuel cell applications. In addition, the CO2 produced from the WGS shift membrane reactor is under high pressure and suitable for sequestration or tertiary oil recovery. In particular, the WGSR represents one of the oldest catalytic reactions used in many industrial processes to produce H2 or ammonia synthesis gas, and is a well-known exothermic reaction [7]: CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 Δ H 298 K 0 = − 41.2 kJ mol − 1 The maturation of the pertinent catalyst technology and the simplicity of the nature of the reaction (such as a no change in the total number of moles combined with a moderate heat of reaction), make the WGSR attractive for applications in the above context [7–11]. In a membrane reactor, as the WGSR proceeds, H2 is removed/separated from the gas mixture of the reaction side continuously. Thus, conversion of the reactants (CO, H2O) substantially exceeds the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion. Notice that separation of H2 through the utilization of a membrane which has a very high selectivity of H2 with respect to other gases is a prerequisite in order to be able to advantageously use high-purity H2 in a fuel cell system. In addition, the outlet stream of the reaction side consists of mostly H2O and CO2 under high pressure making it amenable to capture after condensation of the steam [9–14]. WGSR is of course only one of many possible applications such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions like dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, propane dehydrogenation to propylene, dehydrogenation of alcohols and most prominently methane steam reforming [15]. The performance and economic attractiveness of membrane reactors for H2 from coal plants was investigated by Dolan et al. [16]. Achieving 300 tpd H2 with 85% H2 yield, using a 40 μm-thick Pd-25Ag wt% membrane, was made possible with a total membrane area of 25000 m2. The estimated capital cost of the membrane reactor module was $US ∼180 million, much higher than the capital cost of a unit including high and low temperature shift reactors, amine-based CO2 capture and PSA-based H2 separation ($US ∼55 million). A reduction in membrane thickness (<20 μm), with a plant cost of $US ∼55 million and total membrane area of 13000 m2, was shown to be crucial to meet the 2015 US DOE cost and flux target levels. However, the capital cost itself is not sufficient to make a sound investment decision and possible sources of profits such as selling value of electricity and H2 needs to be taken into account as in the work of Amelio et al. [17]. The traditional IGCC, IGCC with shift reactors and IGCC with membrane reactor were compared in terms of energetic performance, plant efficiency and net power for the case of no CO2 capture by Amelio et al. [17]. The analysis of energetic performances indicated that the net power and also efficiency of the IGCC with membrane reactor was lower than the IGCC with the traditional packed bed reactors mainly due to the power consumption for CO2 compression and the production of steam used as sweep in the membrane reactor. However, these disadvantages were compensated partly by the improved gas turbine performance when fed with H2 in the case of the membrane reactor. More importantly, economic analysis including regulatory action on CO2 suggested that IGCC with membrane reactor would be a better option than the IGCC with traditional packed bed reactors. The selection of the particular membrane type for pure H2 production via WGSR represents the most important decision step in the overall process design. Compared to the conventional hydrogen-permeable membranes, mesoporous ceramic membranes (low selective), microporous ceramic membranes (low selective & permeable), dense ceramic membranes (low permeable) and Pd-based membranes (highly hydrogen permeable and selective toward hydrogen) are the best candidates for catalytic membrane reactors used in reforming and other reactions associated with hydrogen generation [18]. High efficiency H2 production is possible if a membrane is endowed with the following properties: high permeability and selectivity, cost-effective fabrication and maintenance, resistance to feed components/impurities that attenuate H2 permeance (CO, H2S, etc), usability at high temperature (400–600 °C) and pressure (20–50 atm) (the membrane should tolerate the reaction conditions of industrial applications such as dehydrogenation, steam reforming and high temperature WGSRs [19]), easiness in scale up, practical assembly/disassembly for both small and large scale industrial applications, long term durability (5 years, 2015 DOE target [20]). The application of Pd/Pd-alloy composite membranes supported on porous metals, such as porous stainless steel, Inconel or Hastelloy, holds the promise of offering all the advantages associated with the features outlined above. Pd/Pd-Alloy membranes supported on metal (stainless steel, Hastelloy or Inconel) porous cylindrical tubes and welded to both ends of the non-porous stainless steel tubes [21–25] were considered in the present study. The palladium membranes supported on porous substrates have several advantages such as very thin Pd layer (3–20 μm), good mechanical strength and quite high H2 fluxes. Furthermore, the porous metal supports can be integrated into the process easily, while resistance to mechanical cracking and simplicity of the module construction are additional benefits associated with porous metal supports [26]. The most important obstacle about the Pd or Pd/alloy-based membranes is the poisoning of the membrane by the impurities in the feed such as H2S. However, Pd/alloy membranes like Pd/Cu and Pd/Au, have shown promising results in the presence of H2S [25,27–30]. The carbon molecular sieve membrane reactor performance with a syngas feed containing H2S was investigated by Abdollahi et al. [31]. A sulfur tolerant Co/Mo/Al2O3 catalyst and carbon molecular sieve membrane claimed to perform better than the Pd-based composite membrane reactor in the WGS reaction, was used in their study. Promising results were achieved such as: maximum CO conversion and H2 recovery were ∼64 and 47%, respectively by using the dry syngas composition of H2:CO:CO2:CH4:H2S = 39.5%:15.2%:32.4%:12.2%:0.7% with H2O/CO = 1.2 at 250 °C at 5 atm reaction side pressure and sweep ratio of 0.1. Predictions based on a 1-D steady state model at isothermal conditions were compared with lab-scale membrane reactor experimental results and found in good agreement. Since their model fitted the experimental results, the same model was used to predict the large scale (0.0057 mO.D. × 1 mL) membrane reactor performance in the pressure range of 20–30 atm and at 300 °C. The CO content of the permeate flow was predicted to be around 0.3%. If the H2 rich permeate flow would be used in a gas turbine, the carbon molecular sieve membranes would be very suitable. At the same time, if CO2 capture is required, extra separation units for CO2 enrichment would be required at the retentate flow. Moreover, if the ultimate goal is to produce extra purity H2 from the permeate side, extra separation units like in the conventional systems have to be considered along with the carbon molecular sieve membranes: otherwise, the permeate flow containing 0.3% CO could be detrimental for processes requiring extra pure H2 as in current PEM fuel cell applications. Fast thriving membrane technology allows great improvement in the porous silica membrane’s hydrostability, selectivity as well as H2 flux and consequently, it attracted attention for WGS applications [32]. Moreover, metal doped, such as Ni or Co, silica membranes have shown to have improved hydrostability properties [33,34]. Finally, a multi-tube membrane reactor containing two cobalt doped silica membranes was tested under WGSR using an equimolar ratio of H2O and CO. At 375° and 4 bar pressure in the reaction side, 67.5% CO conversion and a permeate stream containing 92.5% H2 were attained [31]. Most of the previous studies on pertinent membrane reactor modeling focused on an 1- or 2-D mathematical representation of the membrane reactor in isothermal or adiabatic operating mode at steady state conditions followed by experimental validation within a relatively broad range of operating conditions [7–13,35–38]. Although the pertinent body of literature encompasses many studies that rely on steady state mathematical models of membrane reactors, Pd/alloy-based membrane reactor studies for analysis and control purposes conducted with the aid of a comprehensive, insightful and computationally tractable unsteady state (dynamic) process modeling framework [39,40] remain relatively limited and deserve further attention. Within such a context, cyclohexane dehydrogenation was compared with isobutene dehydrogenation in a palladium membrane by Raich and Foley [39]. It was predicted that the reactor volume required for isobutane dehydrogenation would need to be at least 750 times larger than the one required for cyclohexane based upon published kinetics for commercial catalysts. Using a transient CSTR–CSTR modeling approach, Raich and Foley [39] studied the coking and deactivation processes of the catalyst and the membrane noting that they could occur in the hydrogen deficient reaction zone of the palladium reactor. On the membrane reactor dynamic analysis front, a non-isothermal unsteady state model was developed to simulate methanol steam reforming using a double-jacketed Pd-based membrane reactor introduced by Fu and Wu [40]. Since various species concentration variations as well as reformer temperature fluctuations are difficult to measure and characterize experimentally during transient periods in the reactor’s operational life, the proposed transient reactor model was used to determine the optimum operating strategy at the start-up stage. The systematic dynamic modeling and optimization studies of the methanol synthesis conducted by Parvasi et al. [41] and, Rahimpour and Behjati [42] included a Pd/Ag membrane in the synthesis loop. The detailed dynamic model encompassing all basic equipments (mixer, heat exchanger, reactor and separator) in the methanol synthesis loop was used to predict the behavior of the overall process [41]. It was shown that increased production rates through the use of Pg/Ag membranes balanced the reduction of the production rates due to catalyst deactivation. A similar approach was followed to optimize the Pd/Ag membrane dual-type methanol reactor performance in the presence of catalyst deactivation with the aid of a dynamic model [42]. The primary dynamic optimization objective was to maximize methanol production b identifying the optimum membrane thickness, the temperatures of feed (cooling gas), cooling saturated water and the processing gas. It should be pointed out that the optimum membrane thickness was found to be only 0.3 μm, and fabrication of highly selective membranes with such a thickness would be certainly challenging. Within the above context, the importance of the availability of a comprehensive, insightful and practically appealing dynamic process modeling framework should be recognized since it offers the means not only to characterize the behavior and performance of Pd/alloy-based membrane reactors during their transient operation, but also inform the design of new experimental studies and the empirical collection of pertinent data aiming at further elucidating the overall process system’s behavior. Furthermore, a better understanding of the dynamic behavior of such a complex system could facilitate the development of efficient process control methods. Responding to the above needs, the primary objective of the present study is the systematic development of such a process dynamic modeling framework in order to analyze and characterize the transient behavior of a Pd/alloy-based (Pd/Au or Pd/Cu) WGS membrane reactor. Furthermore, simple process control ideas are proposed aiming at enhancing process system performance by inducing the desirable dynamic characteristics in the response of the controlled process during start-up as well as in the presence of unexpected adverse disturbances (process upset episodes) or operationally favorable set-point changes that reflect new hydrogen production requirements. In particular, the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 the basic principles and structural characteristics of the proposed dynamic process modeling and control framework are presented followed by Section 3 where a detailed description and discussion of the results of process simulation studies conducted in the case of a lab-scale Pd/alloy-based membrane reactor are presented. Finally, a few concluding remarks are provided in Section 4."
1,Membrane reactor modeling framework,
2,Structural development of the mathematical model,"2.1 Structural development of the mathematical model In the present section, an insightful and computationally tractable dynamic process modeling framework is presented to analyze, characterize and eventually induce the desirable dynamic characteristics through feedback control action in the behavior of a catalytic Pd/Alloy-based water–gas shift (WGS) membrane reactor currently used for the production and separation of pure hydrogen. The composite Pd/Alloy-based membrane is mounted at the center of a stainless steel shell casing as shown in Fig. 1 . The Pd/Alloy-based membrane was on one side of the inner stainless steel tube and the entrance of the inner tube at the membrane side is blocked with a cap, while the other side is located at the reactor exit. The annular space between the shell casing and the membrane is filled with high temperature water–gas shift catalyst and the remaining space of the reactor is filled with inert packing material such as glass beads. The membrane reactor model was set up to characterize reactor transient (dynamic) behavior under the following standard assumptions: constant total pressure and temperature, ideal gas behavior, plug flow, no mass transfer limitations in the catalytic zone, no poisoning of the catalyst under the reaction conditions, and very high selectivity of the membrane. In addition, the Pd/Pd-Alloy membrane was assumed to be already characterized in pure H2 prior to reaction. Thus, the membrane had a stable H2 flux before the reactants were admitted into the reactor. The H2 permeation through the Pd–Pd/Alloy membrane was assumed to follow Sieverts’ Law [43]. Hydrogen separation by Pd–Pd/Alloy membranes based on the solution-diffusion transport mechanism had been studied thoroughly [44]. Shu et al. [45], Ward and Dao [46], Caravella et al. [47,48], Iwuchukwu and Sheth [49] elucidated the details of the multiple step H2 transport mechanism through the Pd foils and Pd-based composite membranes thoroughly. The parameters of the membrane reactor that were used in the simulations are shown in Table 1 . The effects of WGS-component gases on the H2 permeation properties of Pd and Pd/alloy membranes with various thicknesses ∼0.5–80 μm have been investigated extensively [50–56]. Furthermore, the diminishing effect of CO and H2O on H2 permeation was found to be negligible at temperatures above 350 °C [55,56]. Thus, a reaction temperature of 450 °C would be quite effective in practically reducing the effect of CO and H2O. More importantly, two challenges associated with the use of pure Pd membranes, namely H2 embrittlement and poisoning by impurities such as H2S, could be overcome by the utilization of Pd/alloy membranes. Pd/Cu alloys do not exhibit hydrogen embrittlement as severe as pure Pd and the β-hydride phase formation of a Pd-40% Cu alloy occurs even below the room temperature [57]. Thus, Pd/Cu membranes would be durable if the process required temperature cyclings. Additionally, the body-centered cubic (bcc) Pd/Cu alloy has a peak in permeability at a Cu content of 40% and this permeability is only 6% higher than the permeability of pure Pd [58]. Pomerantz et al. [24] were able to fabricate a 16.5 μm thick composite palladium membrane with a thin top Pd/Cu protective layer against sulfur poisoning and without greatly reducing the permeance compared to pure Pd. The composite Pd-18 wt% Cu membrane lost 80% permeance after exposure to 54.2 ppm H2S/H2 for 120 h at 450 °C, but they were able to recover 65% of the initial permeance in pure H2 [24]. Another promising candidate for processing feeds with sulfur impurities is a Pd/Au membrane. Pd/Au alloys showed higher hydrogen permeability than pure Pd for Au contents below 20 wt% and also higher sulfur tolerance compared to other Pd alloys [59–61]. Chen and Ma [25] conducted poisoning experiments by using a 18.1 μm thick Pd/Au composite membrane with 8 wt% Au in 54.8 ppm H2S/H2 at 400 °C for 4 h and managed to recover 100% of the permeance in H2 at 500 °C. Furthermore, the optimum Au composition to attain maximum performance in the presence of H2S up to 5 ppmv was determined to be in the range of 10–30 wt% by Chen and Ma [27]. In addition, a 17 μm thick Pd-based membrane with 12.3 wt% Au retained 61% of its permeance after exposure to 2 ppmv H2S for 24 h but 100% of the permeance was recovered in H2 at 500 °C. These results indicate that until a membrane which is tolerant to high concentrations of sulfur containing gases is developed, advanced sulfur removal units are indispensable at the upstream of the Pd or Pd/Alloy-based membrane reactors. The expression below, namely Eq. (1), was determined via linear regression analysis by Ayturk et al. [62] for the average H2 permeability of H2 in Pd foils and used to estimate the H2 permeability. Only 30% of the resulting permeance was used to calculate the H2 flux in Eq. (2), in order to quantitatively capture the adverse effect of mechanisms such as poisoning into account. (1) Q = Q 0 e − E p R g · T = 6322.7 e − 15630 R g · T (2) J H 2 = 0.3 Q · Δ P H 2 0.5 l If the partial pressure of H2 in the reaction side at the inlet is at least equal to or higher than the permeate side pressure, the membrane area would be used more efficiently. Otherwise the membrane area would not be used for permeation to the tube side until the reaction side H2 partial pressure exceeds the permeate side pressure. A moderate reaction side total pressure of 15 atm would be sufficient enough to provide adequate driving force for H2 permeation at the reactor inlet ( P H 2 Shell | y = 0 − P H 2 tube | y = 0 = 2 atm ) . The permeation of H2 through Pd is an Arrhenius type relation as shown in Eq. (1) and the permeation rate increases as the temperature increases. Besides the increased permeation rates, the forward WGS reaction rate will increase with increased temperature and since the membrane reactor selectively removes H2 the CO conversion would not be limited thermodynamically. Thus, a reaction at 450 °C was considered in the model which was high enough for increased permeation as well as reaction rates while at the same time low enough to ensure membrane integrity. Augustine et al. [63,64] worked with exactly the same type of lab-scale membrane reactor to test the performance of composite Pd-based membranes supported on metal substrates for the WGS reaction. The same reactor dimensions as the one used in the above experimental investigations [63,64] were considered in the ensuing simulations. The membrane reactor modeling framework was realized by a comprehensive mathematical model structurally consisting of a system of material balance equations written component-wise for all species involved. In particular, partial differential equations representing mass balances for each species on the shell and tube sides can be derived on the basis of first principles and are provided below [65]: 2.1.1 Shell side (3) ∂ ∂ t ( F H 2 F Total ) = 1 C Total Shell [ − ∂ F H 2 ∂ ν Shell + 1 Δ ν Shell ∫ W y W y + Δ y r H 2 ⅆ w − Q · A m l · Δ ν Shell · Δ P H 2 0.5 ] i = CO, CO2 and H2O (4) ∂ ∂ t ( F i F Total ) = 1 C Total Shell [ − ∂ F i ∂ ν Shell + 1 Δ ν Shell ∫ W y W y + Δ y r i ⅆ w ] (5) ∂ ∂ t ( F inert F Total ) = − 1 C Total Shell · ∂ F inert ∂ ν Shell 2.1.2 Tube side (6) ∂ ∂ t ( F H 2 F Total ) = 1 C Total Tube [ − ∂ F H 2 ∂ ν Tube + Q · A m l · Δ ν Tube · Δ P H 2 0.5 ] The following reaction rate equation for the WGS reaction over iron–chromium based commercial catalysts expressed through a power-law model was used in the simulation studies [66,67]. The thermodynamic properties listed in the NIST Chemistry Web Book [68] for all gas species involved were used for the equilibrium constant calculation: (7) r = 10 2.845 ± 0.03 · e ( − 111 ± 2.63 R g · T ) · P CO 1.0 ± 0.031 · P CO 2 − 0.36 ± 0.043 · P H 2 1 − 0.09 ± 0.007 · β where (8) β = [ 1 − 1 K P CO 2 · P H 2 P CO · P H 2 O ]"
3,Lumped-parameter finite-dimensional process model approximation,"2.2 Lumped-parameter finite-dimensional process model approximation The transient stage considered in the present study was specified as the time period between the occurrence of an external load/disturbance (e.g. introducing the reactants into the reactor or any unexpected changes in the inlet stream variables, pressure, temperature, etc.) and the final steady state reached by the process. Notice that the partial pressure of hydrogen on both shell and tube sides varies along the length of the reactor during the transient stage, and therefore, an equation describing the dependence of H2 partial pressure on the length of the reactor is necessary for the Sieverts’ law expression in Eqs. (3) and (6). Furthermore, the reaction rate expression in Eq. (7) is highly nonlinear and the system of governing equations involves two independent variables (time and length) as well as an integral term for the reaction under consideration. Therefore, given the above observations on the structure of the mathematical model, finding/computing a solution can be computationally challenging and expensive. Furthermore, process control and monitoring systems involving sensors and actuators placed at certain locations along the process spatial domain are physically realizable and meaningfully designed once a spatial discretization of the above model is performed. Notice however, that the original partial differential equation-based infinite-dimensional reactor model can be accurately approximated by a finite-dimensional lumped-parameter dynamic model if the membrane reactor is partitioned into N zones/compartments/segments each one of them viewed and modeled as a standard continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR). This approximation procedure gives rise to a dynamic membrane reactor model that is comprised of a system of ordinary differential equations mathematically representing component mass balance equations written for each zone and solved simultaneously using an appropriately selected numerical method [69]. Eqs. (9) through (14) form the basis of the aforementioned finite-dimensional lumped-parameter membrane reactor dynamic model-approximant. Each segment/zone of the lumped reactor model introduces 6 ordinary differential mass balance equations for species CO, CO2, H2O, H2 and N2 in the shell side respectively and for H2 in the tube side. The full set of ordinary differential equations consisted of 120 nonlinear dynamic mass balance equations for a total of 20 lumps/zones (N × Number of equations for each segment = 20 × 6) and was numerically solved by using the MATLAB toolbox (ode45). MATLAB solver-ode45 computes the model state at the next time step using an explicit Runge-Kutta (4,5) formula (the Dormand–Prince pair) for numerical integration and more details about the solution method can be found in Mathworks [70]. 2.2.1 Shell side (9) ⅆ f H 2 | y + Δ y ⅆ t = 1 C Total Shell · Δ ν Shell [ f H 2 | y · F Total Shell | y − f H 2 | y + Δ y · F Total Shell | y + Δ y + r H 2 | y + Δ y · Δ w − Q · A m l · Δ P H 2 0.5 ] i = CO, CO2 and H2O (10) ⅆ f i | y + Δ y ⅆ t = 1 C Total Shell · Δ ν Shell [ f i | y · F Total Shell | y − f i | y + Δ y · F Total Shell | y + Δ y + r i | y + Δ y · Δ w ] (11) ⅆ f inert | y + Δ y ⅆ t = 1 C Total Shell · Δ ν Shell [ f inert | y · F Total Shell | y − f inert | y + Δ y · F Total Shell | y + Δ y ] (12) F Total Shell | y + Δ y = F Total Shell | y − Q · A m l · Δ P H 2 0.5 2.2.2 Tube side (13) ⅆ f H 2 | y + Δ y ⅆ t = 1 C Total Tube · Δ ν Tube [ f H 2 | y · F Total Tube | y − f H 2 | y + Δ y · F Total Tube | y + Δ y + Q · A m l · Δ P H 2 0.5 ] (14) F Total Tube | y + Δ y = F Total Tube | y + Q · A m l · Δ P H 2 0.5 If the length of the reactor volume, on which the mass balance equation was based, is assumed to be very small, then the average of the H2 partial pressures at the inlet and at the outlet of the control volume can be used in the Sieverts’ law expression in order to explicitly quantify the driving force for H2 permeation through the Pd-based membrane layer as in Eq. (15). At the end, the CO conversion and hydrogen recovery levels were found by using Eqs. (16) and (17). (15) Δ P H 2 0.5 = P H 2 Shell | y + P H 2 Shell | y + Δ y 2 − P H 2 Tube | y + P H 2 Tube | y + Δ y 2 (16) X CO = [ F CO Shell | y = 0 − F CO Shell | y ] / F CO Shell | y = 0 (17) R H 2 = F H 2 Tube | y / [ F CO Shell | y = 0 + F H 2 Shell | y = 0 ] The particular set of boundary conditions and initial condition for a well-posed problem formulation and the computation of the solution of the system of Eqs. (3)–(6) are as follows: Boundary condition at the inlet: The molar flow rates of each gaseous species at the inlet stream of the catalytic zone remain constant for all times. (18) F i | y = 0 = Constant Boundary condition at the exit: At the interface between the porous part and the catalytic area, species entering the control volume exit it with no further change. (19) ∂ F i / ∂ y = 0 Initial conditions: Two different initial conditions for the start-up and for the dynamic behavior of the membrane reactor in the presence of unexpected disturbances were considered. During the start-up stage of the reactor, only steam and H2 are flowing through the reactor before admitting the reactants into the reactor: 47.6% H2O and 52.4% H2. In the second case, the initial condition is the process nominal steady state just before the occurrence of a process upset episode whereby an unexpected disturbance strikes driving the process away from the nominal steady state (please refer to Fig. 4[b] in the ensuing discussion)."
4,Process control framework,"2.3 Process control framework When a disturbance occurs in an unexpected and unpredictable manner, the process is driven away from its nominal and often operationally favorable design steady state. In such a case the primary control objective is to bring the process back to the aforementioned steady state in a fast and smooth manner, thus rejecting the disturbance effect (regulator problem). Furthermore, one may envision cases, where the control objective is to drive the process to a new operationally favorable steady state that reflects a set of performance specifications, new production targets/requirements, process safety and process economics criteria, etc. by enforcing key process variables to approach desirable set-point values (servo-mechanism problem). In both cases, the primary objectives can be typically met though the use of a feedback controller such as a Proportional Integral (PI) controller. Indeed, a simple PI feedback control system was considered in order to meet membrane reactor performance requirements such as one cast in terms of the overall CO conversion level of the WGS reaction by controlling the CO fraction (dry basis) at the reactor exit. In particular: • The controlled output variable considered in the present study was the fraction of CO at the exit of the shell side which in turn dictates the overall CO conversion. The set point can be chosen depending on the desired CO conversion level. The set point was 2.32% and 1.2% for the servo and regulator problems respectively, which will be discussed next in greater detail. • The manipulated input variable considered was the steam molar flow rate at the reactor entrance/inlet. In order to meet the primary control objectives, the PI controller generates an actuating signal and determines an input variable profile by processing the error between the measured output variable and its set-point value in the following fashion: (20) Error = f CO Dry | exit − f CO Set Point (21) F H 2 O ( t ) | y = 0 = F H 2 O ( t = 0 ) | y = 0 + K c · Error + K c τ I ∫ 0 t Error · ⅆ t An appropriate set of values for the integral time constant τI and the proportional gain Kc in Eq. (21) has to be determined (controller tuning problem). Although there are several approaches for tuning a controller such as the one-quarter decay ratio criterion, integral performance criteria and procedures that involve semi empirical rules of limited validity, a more direct and transparent approach has been utilized in the estimation of the proper set of values for the adjustable controller parameters. These were explicitly determined on the basis of a set of desirable dynamic characteristics of the controlled process response such as speed, smoothness and robustness in the presence of disturbances subject to process economics and energy efficiency constraints."
5,Main results and discussion,"Table 2 shows typical compositions of syngas that might be expected from different gasifiers [66,71]. In particular, the feed gas compositions listed in Table 2 were used in the model to determine feeding and operating conditions that lead to undesirably low conversion levels, so that process performance enhancement could be attained through feedback control action. Theoretically predicted results using the above dynamic process model when steady state was reached are given in Table 3 in terms of CO conversion and hydrogen recovery corresponding to these different feed compositions. The calculated hydrogen recovery and CO conversions were very similar except for the feed composition at the backend of the WGS reactor (F). Notice that placing the membrane reactor after the existing WGS reactors is an option, however replacing the WGS reactors with a membrane reactor would be a more efficient one. The utilization of a Pd-based membrane as an H2 separation unit would be of course more advantageous when the syngas contains high amounts of H2 as in the case of F. The feed with the slurry-feed coal-derived syngas composition (E) and the lowest conversion level was used in the ensuing simulation runs. An H2O:CO ratio of 2 was used in Table 2, however, the original feed composition of a GE gasifier (slurry-feed coal-derived syngas) is typically associated with higher H2O:CO ratio values (H2O:CO = 4). Finally, it should be pointed out that integrating the WGS Pd-based membrane reactor and a CO2 capture and sequestration system with the GE gasifier exhibits significant advantages because of the particular composition of the syngas [72]. The accuracy of the lumped-parameter finite-dimensional reactor modeling approach can be assessed by comparing its predictions with the exact first principle-based steady state membrane reactor model through simulation studies [69]. The results/predictions generated by the lumped-parameter model when there is no further change in the various concentration profiles (steady state conditions) should match those offered by the exact steady state model. Fig. 2 shows the steady state CO conversion and H2 recovery profiles both for the exact steady state model and for the lumped-parameter one. The CO conversion at the exit of the membrane reactor was 97%, exceeding the equilibrium conversion by 1 under the same temperature and feed compositions as reported in Table 2. The lumped-parameter model was simulated for different numbers of lumps/compartments/zones (n = 5, 20 and 30). As shown in Fig. 2[a], increasing the number of lumps/zones led to a CO conversion profile approach to the one provided by the detailed first principle-based steady state model, suggesting that the proposed lumped-parameter finite-dimensional model approximation exhibits very satisfactory convergence properties as the number of lumps/zones increases. Particularly for the first 10% of the reactor volume, the length increments could be decreased to obtain a better fit. Even though the overall CO conversion at the reactor exit for all values of number of lumps considered was the same, the CO conversion at any point deviated most with N = 5 for z < 0.6 as shown in Fig. 2[a]. If additional feeds had to be added along the length of the reactor to drive the reaction and permeation rates to higher levels or segmental control strategies were applied, the partial pressures of each species at the specific location need to be known. Furthermore, a model conceptualization of reactors in series might be usefully employed for various design purposes. For instance, at a CO conversion target level of 90% at the first reactor exit, a model prediction made by considering an N = 5 could be misleading for the calculation of membrane length and could overestimate the membrane cost. Since the closest results to the full first principle steady state model were derived with N ≥ 20, the minimum number of lumps with the best fit (within the aforementioned trials) to the steady state model concentration profiles was determined to be N = 20 and used in all of the simulation runs/scenarios discussed next. The permeated H2 levels in each segment ( η H 2 ) and H2 recovery profiles shown in Fig. 2[b] indicated that the extents of neither the reaction nor permeation were significant in the last 60% of the membrane reactor length, and consequently, this reactor scale would be suitable for higher feed flow rates in order to use the membrane reactor under its maximum efficiency. The simulation results were compared with the experimental results reported by Augustine et al. [63]. A 12 μm thick Pd-based membrane synthesized by electroless plating which had an oxide layer [73] and Pd/Ag layers as the intermetallic diffusion barriers [21,74] were tested at the same reaction conditions listed in Table 1. The membrane had a permeability constant (Q 0) of 6375.38 [m3 μm/(m2 h atm0.5)], activation energy of 16.6 kJ/mol, H2/He selectivity of greater than 1000 and the feed was 22.5% CO, 45.9% H2O, 21.8% H2 and 9.8% CO2 with a total inlet flow rate of 963 sccm during the experiment. Even though the predicted CO conversion level was very close to the experimental value, there was a 10% discrepancy in the H2 recovery level as listed in Table 4 . Some possible reasons of the over-predicted H2 recovery levels would be the constant H2 partial pressure in the radial direction and/or plug flow assumption as well as a concentration polarization [75–80]. Finally, it should be pointed out that the above 1-D dynamic reactor model represents a quite useful tool for a quick, yet reliable, assessment of the overall membrane reactor performance as well as a computationally attractive option for screening the design space and thus identifying viable designs that would merit further examination through the development of higher dimensional membrane reactor models [81,82]."
6,Dynamic analysis and characterization of the membrane reactor’s behavior during the start-up stage,"3.1 Dynamic analysis and characterization of the membrane reactor’s behavior during the start-up stage The first task was to characterize the spatial distribution profiles of the fractions of each component as a function of time during the start-up stage of the process. The solution sought was based on the specifications given in Table 1 and the feed was the slurry-feed-coal-derived syngas. As pointed out earlier, it was assumed that the membrane was already characterized in pure H2.We considered steam and H2 (H2O: 47.57%–H2: 52.43%) flowing through the shell side just before the feed was administered into the reactor. No vacuum was applied on the tube side and the pressure of the permeate flow was 1 atm. Figs. 3 and 4 show the simulation results for the start-up of the process. Fig. 3 shows the fractions of gases as a function of time where each line corresponds to a position starting from the reactor inlet/entrance and ending at the exit of the last segment or zone. The line which appears first on the time scale in Fig. 3 belongs to segment 1 and the line which responds last on the time scale belongs to segment 20 (exit of the reactor). The direction of the dashed arrow lines in each figure indicates the increasing number of segments or zones (starting from the inlet and ending at the exit of the reactor). As shown in Fig. 3, the system reached steady state conditions in 10 s. If there were no reaction, the CO fraction at the exit of each segment would be expected to increase at a level higher than the inlet CO fraction corresponding to steady state. However, the consumption of CO by the WGS reaction caused the CO fraction to decrease at the exit of each segment as a function of time as shown in Fig. 3[a]. At time equaled zero, only H2 and H2O were present in the reaction side. The H2O fractions were decreasing toward the reactor exit due to the depletion of H2. After the reaction started, the fast reaction rate at the reactor inlet caused the drop in H2O fraction in the initial segments shown in Fig. 3[b]. The reason of the drastic decrease at the segments close to the exit was the increase in the CO2 amount and the depletion of H2 through permeation. The forward reaction rate was faster than the backward reaction rate due to the continuous H2 removal from the shell side to the tube side. Thus, the fraction of CO2 at the exit of each segment in Fig. 3[c] exceeded the inlet fraction of CO2 as time progressed. The H2 fraction before the reaction’s initiation was higher than the maximum possible H2 fraction (20% H2 plus 23.7% CO) of the reaction feed. Consequently, the most significant decrease in H2 fraction occurred at the first half of the reactor where the H2 permeation was higher as shown in Fig. 3[d]. Furthermore, the fraction of H2 at any time decreased as a function of the reactor length due to the permeation of H2 as depicted in Fig. 3[d]. Particularly in the last 25% of the reactor’s length, the H2 fraction profiles were not affected drastically because both the reaction and permeation rates were practically very low within this zone. The time period required to obtain pure H2 from the tube side at a certain flow rate during the start-up stage was crucial because the knowledge of the starting time was required. The spatial distribution of the H2 molar flow rate is presented in Fig. 4 [a]; the direction of the dashed arrow line corresponds to increasing time from t = 0 to t = 12 s. In Fig. 4[a], the H2 production rate decreased as the time progressed because of the difference in the H2 fraction in the reaction side before and after the reaction had started, as previously stated. Fig. 4[b] contains the spatial profiles of the various fractions along the length of the reactor at t = 10 (steady state). It should be noted that the minimum H2 and CO fractions at the exit of the shell side of the reactor could reduce the cost associated with the separation units placed after (downstream) the membrane reactor. The total flow at the shell exit was composed of mainly 39.8% steam and 50.9% CO2. The low H2 and CO amounts at the reaction side exit (7.8 and 1.4%) could be further reduced by the application of sweep or vacuum, as discussed previously. Finally, the fractions at the final time in Fig. 4[b] will be used as the new “initial conditions” for the ensuing process control simulations. The H2 fraction in the shell side did not go down to zero in Fig. 4[b] because no sweep/vacuum was applied. The H2 permeation stopped when the partial pressure of H2 in the shell side became equal to the partial pressure of H2 in the tube side. Maintaining the H2 partial pressure in the tube side lower than the shell side could cause all H2 in the shell side to permeate into the tube side almost instantaneously. The fast depletion rate of H2 by permeation would cause an increased forward reaction rate in the shell side. Vacuum or sweep flow could be applied in the tube side to maintain a lower partial pressure of H2 in the tube side. As the rate of permeation increased due to the increased driving force, the rate of the forward reaction increased. At the same time, the consequences of the application of vacuum or sweep had to be considered. If vacuum were applied to the tube side, an extra cost would be added when the full process system economics is taken into account. The H2 flow mixed with the He sweep had to be separated to obtain pure H2. In light of an earlier discussion, the dynamic process equations in the simulations were solved by assuming that neither a sweep flow nor vacuum was applied in the tube side. Future simulation studies will include explicit mathematical expressions for the sweep and vacuum to assess their effect on reactor performance. The primary objective associated with the use of the Pd/alloy-based membrane reactor was to increase the forward reaction rate of the WGS reaction and also to use the membrane with its maximum efficiency to obtain pure H2 flow from the tube side. The additional separation costs that are required in a packed bed reactor for H2 separation could be eliminated since the membrane reactor could achieve 87% H2 recovery (no sweep/vacuum) with the aforementioned reaction conditions and membrane properties. The CO conversion at the exit of the reactor was 97% when the system reached steady state. Even though this value of CO conversion was much higher than the thermodynamically determined equilibrium conversion of 79.4%, it could be further enhanced through proper process re-design and adjustment of the regime of operating conditions (total molar flow rate, inlet compositions, temperature, pressure, etc.) or applying a process control strategy."
7,The regulator problem: rejecting the effect of unexpected pressure drop,"3.2 The regulator problem: rejecting the effect of unexpected pressure drop In a typical regulator problem, the feedback controller is designed in order to take action and keep the process at its nominal design steady state (assuming no set point changes) by eliminating the effect of a disturbance (such as total pressure or temperature) that may occur unexpectedly and upset the process. In the specific underlying scenario considered in the present study, it was assumed that while the process system was operating at a nominal steady state, the total pressure dropped from 15 to 10 atm unexpectedly staying at 10 atm for the rest of the process operation (disturbance step-change). In this scenario, the PI controller regulates the steam flow rate (manipulated input) so that the CO fraction (process output) reverts to its original and operationally favorable nominal steady state value, thus rejecting the potentially adverse disturbance effect on process performance. The particular initial conditions for the initialization of the simulation runs corresponded to the values reported in Fig. 4[b]. Furthermore, all of the inlet molar flow rates of CO, CO2 and H2 were the same as the ones given in Table 1, and the set point for the CO fraction at the exit remained the same at 2.32% CO (dry basis). Please notice, that all the above values constitute and represent the nominal design steady state in the process regulation problem under consideration. Also notice, that if there were no process control action, the CO fraction at the exit would change with time as shown in the dashed line in Fig. 5 [b]. Specifically, the CO fraction at the exit would increase during the first 5 s and remain at the same value inevitably resulting in an undesirably low CO conversion value. Tuning of the proportional gain (Kc ) and integral time constant (τI ) of the PI controller employed, while non-trivial, remains important from a process control quality standpoint. The first attempt to controller tuning was to find a reasonable set of initial values for τI and Kc without compromising process stability and robustness of the process response. The dynamic process responses generated for different Kc values with fixed τI (1 s) and also the responses for different τI values with fixed Kc (0.002) are shown in Fig. 5. In particular, the tuning of τI and Kc and their respective ranges of values considered in the simulation study, induces the following dynamic characteristics on the response of the closed-loop system: As Kc increases, the response becomes faster driving the process closer to the nominal values at the expense of occasionally introducing oscillatory dynamic behavior. The above oscillations can be satisfactorily suppressed through the appropriate tuning of τI [83]. Proper values of the controller parameters during the tuning process were identified and selected by taking into account the following: • Fast and stable responses without oscillatory characteristics. • Minimum consumption of steam for energy efficiency and favorable process economics. • Smooth steam flow rate profiles with no drastic excursions from operationally favorable operating conditions to facilitate physical realizability and efficiency in actuating. While the steam molar flow rate shown in Fig. 5[a] had to be lowered by considering the energy efficiency of the system, the time required for the steam flow rate to equilibrate had to be minimized. In Fig. 5[b], the trends of the CO fraction at the exit for a Kc value equal to 0.028 or higher had a maximum and minimum, which was clearly undesirable. In Fig. 5[b], the controlled output, i.e., the CO fraction at the exit, reached the set point value at shorter times as the value of Kc increased, however, closed-loop stability was compromised when the value of Kc increased to 0.024 and higher. Closed-loop stability was restored when Kc decreased; however, the required time to revert to the nominal steady state value was longer. The steam flow rate reached steady state after 250 s when Kc was 0.0005. The best value of Kc was found to be 0.002 without inducing oscillatory behavior while at the same time enforcing a quite fast response time of 65 s. In Fig. 5[c], the overall CO conversion profile of the process passed through a minimum (91%) which could of course cause deviations from predetermined product quality specifications. The minimum in the CO conversion profile resulted from a controller delay time of approximately 3 s while the rate of increase in steam flow rate was slow. Fig. 5[d–f] shows the effect of the integral time constant, τI , on the process response. The fine tuning was performed by adjusting τI . The responses of the controlled process with varying τI values were similar to the trends shown in Fig. 5[a]. The residence time calculated based on the inlet flow rate (residence time = void volume/volumetric flow rate at the inlet) was 1.4 s. The first trial values of τI were chosen close to the residence time value. When τI was 0.1 s, thus much smaller than the residence time, the controller increased the steam flow rate too fast as shown in Fig. 5[d]. As a result, the controlled output experienced an overshoot at 4 s and undershoots at 6 s as depicted in Fig. 5 [e], settling down after a time period of 100 s. An appropriate value for τI of 0.8 s was selected for a Kc value of 0.002 so that reversion to the nominal design steady state in the presence of the above disturbance was attained within the shortest possible time (50 s) in a smooth manner. Please notice that the ratio of H2O:CO increased to 3.8 at the end of a 50 s period under the above values of Kc and τI . More importantly, the CO conversion was kept at 95% which was higher than the uncontrolled conversion with a marked difference of 15%. Those two values were then used for the evaluation of membrane reactor performance under PI control and the pertinent closed-loop results/responses are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 . The driving force for H2 permeation was reduced in the presence of the disturbance considered, namely the change in the system pressure, and therefore, the declining trend in the H2 production rate profile from the permeate side was the one intuitively expected: specifically, a 36% decrease was calculated as shown in Fig. 6[a]. Even though the H2 production rate was reduced, the controller could maintain the dry based CO fraction at the reaction side exit at its nominal value of 2.32%. Notice that the retentate side stream could be processed for high pressure CO2 sequestration without being affected by the pressure drop until the system returns to its regular operation. As shown in Fig. 6[b], the effect of the increased inlet steam flow rate on the retentate side stream composition started at t = 4 s which is equal to the total time realized by the residence time and the delay time (dead time) associated with the controller action. The total pressure at the reaction side dropped from 15 to 10 atm and the permeation continued until the H2 partial pressures corresponding to reaction and permeate sides equaled each other. Consequently, the 8% H2 content of retentate stream increased to 15% as time progressed and shown in Fig. 6[b]. The most significant change at the reaction side exit was observed in the CO2 fractions because the retentate side stream consisted of mostly H2O and CO2. The increased steam fraction is of course correlated to the decrease in the CO2 fraction at the reaction side exit. The remaining H2 in the retentate stream could be proven quite valuable by pursuing vigorous design options: a membrane separation unit with vacuum pump on the permeate side or compressor on the membrane inlet could be utilized to further separate H2 and concentrate CO2 at the membrane exit if one considers potential enhancement options for the underlying process economics. The membrane reactor could achieve 95% CO conversion and 56% H2 recovery with the pertinent profiles given in Fig. 6[c] at the end of the regulatory control action. The retentate stream now contained 62% CO2 36% H2 (no steam) as shown in Fig. 6[d]. After the utilization of the energy value of H2 and condensation of steam, the retentate side stream would be mostly CO2. The remained H2 in the retentate stream could be used as a fuel or it could be purified through an additional membrane separation unit. Alternatively, vacuum could be applied on the tube side to remove almost all of the H2 from the reaction side. The decision of course between these options needs to be done by conducting a comprehensive process economic analysis under various plant configurations. The highest H2 partial pressure was observed along the initial segments of the membrane reactor. The extent of produced H2 by the forward reaction was higher than the amount of the permeated H2 at the first 3 segments (up to 0.9 cm), resulting in a sudden increase in H2 partial pressure observed along the initial segments of the membrane reactor and depicted in Fig. 7. Increased steam flow rates also force the WGS reaction to proceed toward the product side. As the controller increased the steam flow rate slowly during the first 2 s, the H2 extent increased because of the increased forward reaction rate. Following that, a rather drastic H2 pressure drop was observed in between t = 2–6 s because of the unexpected drop in the total system pressure. As the controller increased the steam flow rate, the H2 partial pressure started decreasing due to the increased H2O fraction for t = 6–30 s in Fig. 7. Additionally, Fig. 7 indicated that the H2 partial pressure profiles equilibrated around steady state after 30 s."
8,The servo-mechanism problem: decreased exit CO fraction,"3.3 The servo-mechanism problem: decreased exit CO fraction In a typical servo-mechanism process control problem, disturbance load variables are kept constant at their nominal values while the set point undergoes a deliberate change reflecting new process performance specifications (such as new production requirements, safety and environmental regulatory ones, etc) Within this context, the feedback controller takes action in such a way that the controlled output (the CO fraction at the exit of the shell in the present study) closely tracks the new set point value in a fast and smooth manner. Notice that when the slurry-feed-derived syngas was used as the feed, the CO fraction at the reaction side exit was already too low (2.32% dry basis). However, the dry basis CO fraction of 2.32% at the reactor exit could be reduced even further (to 1.2%) under the action of a PI servo-mechanism controller in order to meet more stringent production requirements. In Fig. 8 , similar tuning guidelines to the regulator case were followed in the servo mechanism one. The closed-loop system’s stability can be compromised at Kc values higher than 0.03 and τI values lower than 0.1 s. Furthermore, the speed of the process response and transition to the new set point was adversely impacted by Kc values lower than 0.0008 and τI values higher than 6 s, and the maximum peak in the steam flow rate observed for a Kc = 0.03 (shown in Fig. 8[a]) was clearly undesirable from an energy efficiency and process economics point of view. Additionally, this observed peak of the steam flow rate and the associated residence time could cause CO conversion to decrease. Once the value of Kc was set at 0.003 providing a fast and stable response, fine tuning was performed by adjusting the value of τI as shown in Fig. 8[d] through [f]. The value of τI was adjusted by aiming to reduce the exit CO fraction level in Fig. 8[e]. The overall CO conversion decreased slightly to 95.6% during that delay time and then the conversion improved by climbing to the 97.6% level through the action of the controller with τI = 2 as shown in Fig. 8[f]. The best set of values for Kc and τI were identified as 0.003 and 2 s respectively by ensuring that the set point was satisfactorily tracked in a fast, stable, smooth and as energy efficient manner as possible. Finally, notice that the H2O:CO mole ratio increased from 2 to 5.8 when the new set point was reached. Exploring the changes in the driving force for H2 permeation would allow us to better understand and characterize the membrane reactor behavior while the process was controlled. Fig. 9 shows the H2 partial pressure profiles along the length of the reactor as a function of time in the reaction side. When the increase in the steam flow rate was still at a moderate level until the first 6 s, the H2 partial pressure was increasing in all of the reactor segments (spatial domain) as shown in Fig. 9. While the membrane reactor was already using the benefit of removal of H2 from the product side, the addition of extra steam caused the WGS reaction to shift to the product side further. Thus the H2 partial pressure increased at the first 6 s due to a slight increase in the inlet steam flow rate. Then, the controller continued to increase the steam flow rate to reach the new set point of 1.2% CO at the reaction side exit. Since the total pressure in the reaction side remained constant, the H2 partial pressure decreased due to the increased steam fraction until the inlet steam flow rate reached its steady state value after 442 s. The increase in the driving force for H2 permeation (because of the increasing inlet steam flow rate during the first 6 s) is associated with increased H2 production rates during the first 6 s as shown in Fig. 10 [a]. As the inlet steam flow rate continued to increase, the H2 fraction and driving force decreased in response. In addition to the decreased driving force, the residence time was also reduced by the increased steam flow rate. The decreased driving force for H2 permeation, together with the reduced residence time due to the higher steam flow rate caused a 24.6% decrease in the H2 production rate depicted in Fig. 10[a]. In Fig. 10[b], the CO2 and H2O had the highest fractions at the reaction side exit, thus, as the inlet steam flow rate increased, the most drastic change observed was the one in the CO2 fraction at the reactor exit profile during the course of the PI controller action. The membrane reactor attained the new steady state with 97.6% CO conversion and 63.4% H2 recovery with the profiles graphically represented in Fig. 10[c]. Most of the CO was converted along the initial segments in the reactor’s spatial domain; however, the rest of the reactor was used efficiently for the H2 recovery. While the extra pure H2 from the permeate side could be used for the processing/synthesis of other chemicals or fuel cell applications, the retentate stream consisting of 66.4% CO2, 32.4% H2 and 1.2% CO could be utilized as a turbine fuel with a diluent, such as nitrogen [84,85] within an IGCC plant configuration. As a final reflection, please notice that even though the CO fraction at the reaction side exit (and thus conversion) was successfully controlled in both the regulator and servo-mechanism cases, H2 recovery was reduced due to the decreased driving force for H2 permeation. The same process control scenarios were repeated by using a membrane having permeance value equal to 100% of a 10 μm Pd foil and compared with the above results in Table 5 . The production rate and recovery of H2 could be certainly improved by using a Pd-based membrane with higher permeance. Not only the H2 recovery was improved but also the controller used less steam as the permeance increased. Moreover, it should be pointed out that the purpose of the simple process control framework developed in this work was to show the feasibility of maintaining not only a high H2 production rate but also high levels of CO conversion in the presence of external disturbances and set-point changes given hard process economics and energy efficiency constraints. Thus, an ∼20–30% decrease in H2 recovery at the end of the process control action might be deemed acceptable until corrective action is taken and the total system pressure is restored to its original value within the shortest possible time for example. Furthermore, advanced multivariate control configurations and algorithms could potentially further enhance the quality of control by addressing the above challenges through a more sophisticated structure at the expense of higher costs and complexity in implementation, controller tuning and maintenance. Notice also that the controller action led to an increase in the H2O:CO ratio from 2 to 3.8 and 5.8 in the regulator and servo-mechanism cases respectively. Even though the heating cost of steam is certainly not negligible, there are other benefits that could be potentially realized through the use of excess steam. The increased steam flow rate could definitely shift the WGS reaction toward the product side and thus increase reaction yields together with the removal of H2. Moreover, if temperature control is not highly effective in the case of a non-isothermal membrane reactor, the high latent heat of steam could help decrease the temperature rise in the reaction side due to the exothermic WGS reaction. Notice that the Pd-based membrane should be protected from a possible formation of hot spots, and intermetallic diffusion and leak formation could become problematic at temperatures higher than 550 °C due to decreased permeation and selectivity [21,86]. The temperature profile of the membrane reactor could be thus maintained under almost isothermal conditions by proper adjustment of the pre-heater temperature and by using the benefit of excess steam to eliminate a potential temperature rise due to the exothermic reaction. Furthermore, the deactivation of catalyst and/or the membrane by coke formation could be prevented by using excess steam. Finally, it should be pointed out that a comprehensive process economics framework that explicitly acknowledges the cost of compressor for the membrane reactor and CO2 sequestration, vacuum pump or excess steam together with the value of produced H2 as an energy carrier should form the basis of any sound investment decision-making platform in the technology options under consideration."
9,Conclusions,"In the present study an insightful and computationally tractable process dynamic modeling framework was developed and presented in order to analyze and characterize the transient behavior of a lab-scale Pd/Alloy-based membrane (Pd/Cu or Pd/Au) reactor. Furthermore, the feasibility of a simple process control framework was examined in the presence of unexpected disturbances and operationally favorable set-point changes. Although there is, in principle, a plethora of different scenarios relevant to process control studies, two main illustrative cases were considered, namely the process regulation and servo mechanism ones. In both control structures, quite satisfactory process control was attained maintaining CO conversion at levels higher than 95% so that the retentate stream could become suitable for high pressure CO2 sequestration. Finally, since the rapidly evolving field of membrane technology may facilitate the synthesis and practical utilization of membranes with higher permeance levels and resistance to impurities in hydrogen production and separation process systems, not only could the performance of such systems be further enhanced but also process control strategies could become more effective, energy efficient and economically advantageous."
