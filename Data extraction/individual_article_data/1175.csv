0,Introduction,"According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere reached 419 ppm in 2021, far exceeding the upper limit of safe concentration 350 ppm. High concentration of CO2 led to a multitude of environmental problems, a spate of extreme weather (extremely hot, extremely cold, rainstorm, etc.) continue to appear [1,2]. Therefore, dealing with CO2 reasonably has become the focus of dealing with extreme environmental problems at present. Among the many CO2 treatment schemes, CO2 electrocatalytic reduction (CO2RR) was unique reaction that converts CO2 into high value-added products (methane [3], methanol [4], ethanol [5], etc.) through renewable electric energy [6–10]. Therefore, CO2 electrocatalytic reaction can not only solve the problem of CO2 treatment, but also realize the energy reserve from electric energy to chemical energy [11–13]. CO2 has the advantages of clean energy storage and environmental friendliness. However, the conversion of CO2 to the designated product involves multi-step elementary reactions and multi-electron transfer steps, which leads to low selectivity and low reaction rate of CO2RR [14,15]. To achieve large-scale industrialization, reaction catalysts were added to the reaction to improve the performance of the reaction [16,17]. The unique electronic structure of these catalysts changes the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates, which leads to the improvement of the selectivity of certain products. Among the many alternative catalysts, bimetallic catalyst have attracted wide attention because of their easy to control content and strong adjustable adsorption energy of intermediates [18–21]. A tunable In(OH)3 coupled Cu2O derivative hybrid catalyst was synthesized by Li [22,23]. The synergistic effect between Cu–In bimetals improved the reaction performance. The CO selectivity of 90.37% was achieved at −0.8 V vs RHE. The electronic effect between the metals changes the original electronic structure of the metal and adjusts the adsorption strength of the intermediate on the surface of the catalyst. Among them, the inner metal and the outer metal of the bimetallic catalyst with core-shell structure carry out electron transfer through the interface to change the electronic structure of the inner and outer metal [24]. Uniquely, the reaction occurs only on the outer metal surface, which makes it possible to realize the homogenization of the active site. Chang [25] prepared the structure of Ag@Cu bimetallic nanoparticles by polyol method. Interestingly, as the Cu coating thickens, the reaction products gradually transform from CO to C2 products, which indicates that Ag nuclear energy affects the adsorption strength of Cu shell to reaction intermediates. However, the products of bimetallic catalysts were also easily limited by the type and composition of metals, which can not efficiently produce high energy density (such as methanol, ethanol, etc.) products. Therefore, it was very important to propose an improved strategy to improve the performance of bimetallic catalysts. According to previous studies, due to the existence of metal-oxygen bonds and metal-metal oxide interfaces, the CO bond of CO2 was easy to bend and activate on the surface of metal oxides, which helps to reduce the overpotential of the reaction [26–28]. Therefore, we imagine that the reaction performance of the catalyst can be improved by constructing a metal-metal oxide interface on the bimetal surface. However, the traditional heat treatment in high temperature environment was difficult to accurately control the thickness of oxide layer, which takes a long time, which leads to the limitation of catalyst preparation [29,30]. Cold plasma technology has the characteristics of low temperature and high activity, which avoids the disadvantage that it was difficult to control the thickness of oxide layer during high temperature oxidation [31–33]. The nanoscale Cu–CuO interface can be easily controlled by adjusting the working parameters of the plasma. This paper mainly discusses the regulation of selectivity and activity of Cu–CuO interface to CO2RR. A series of catalysts with different Cu–CuO interfaces were prepared by air-plasma system and the relationship between the structure and activity of the catalysts was discussed. The catalyst with optimized Cu–CuO interface showed much higher selectivity for light alcohols than that of Ag@Cu catalyst. It was worth mentioning that the Faraday efficiency of light alcohols shows an obvious volcanic curve, which indicates that Ag@Cu was significantly sensitive to the change of Cu–CuO interface. At-0.8V, the efficiency of Ag@Cu-10 (treatment time 10min) Faraday of low carbon alcohol reached 65.5%, which was 19.9% higher than that of Ag@Cu catalyst. The stability test showed that the Ag@Cu-10 catalyst remained stable for more than 60 h."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis Ag NPs: add 1.61 g silver acetylacetonate to the flask containing 8.33 g oleic acid and 11.54 g tri-n-octyl phosphine. Then the mixture was degassed at 100 °C and heated at 220 °C in inert atmosphere for 2 h to obtain a black solution. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, 40 mL acetone was added and the black product was obtained by centrifugation. Finally, Ag nanoparticles were dispersed in hexane to obtain Ag dispersion solution. Ag@Cu: 1 mL CuCl2 (0.1 M), 1.01 g Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 3 mL Ag disperse solution and 3 mL NaOH (1 M) were added to 90 mL deionized water and stirred until homogeneous solution was formed. Under intense stirring, 3 mL hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution was injected into the above reaction mixture and aged at room temperature for 2 h. Solid particles were obtained from the mixed solution by centrifugation. After washing the solid particles with deionized water and ethanol several times, the solid particles were reduced to Ag@Cu by adding sufficient amount of formaldehyde. The reduction temperature was 70 °C and the reduction time was 12 h to ensure that Cu2O was completely reduced. Ag@Cu-X: at room temperature, the obtained Ag@Cu particles were treated with 1–60 min in 100W and 20 ml/min air-plasma to obtain a series of catalysts with different Cu–CuO interfaces, denoted as Ag@Cu-X (X = 1–60 min)."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The crystallinity and spatial configuration of the crystals were studied by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (graphite Monochromator, RigakuD/max-3C). The morphology of the crystal and EDS was observed by transmission electron microscope (FEI Talos F200s G2) and scanning electron microscope (JSM-7800F). XPS was used to analyze the composition and valence of elements on the surface of the catalyst. The spectrometer was ESCALAB 250Xi, the manufacturer was Thermo Fisher Scientific, and the scattering angle of the instrument was 130°. The base pressure in the process of spectrum acquisition was better than that of 2 × 10−7 mbar realized by turbo-molecular pump. The excitation source was Al-Kα (1486.6eV), which was equipped with Monochromator and works at 72w. The single point analysis area of XPS was 500 μm × 300 μm. Four points were randomly selected for each sample and the average was calculated. The spectrum was obtained sequentially. The work function of the sample was determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) [34–36]. The XPS was calibrated according to the equation of reference [37]. Within the range of measurement accuracy, E B F + φ S A = 289.58 e V remains unchanged. The work functions of Ag@Cu, Ag@Cu-1, Ag@Cu-5, Ag@Cu-10 and Ag@Cu-20 catalysts were 4.54 eV, 4.60 eV, 4.62 eV, 4.61 eV and 4.65 eV. After correction according to Refs. [34–37], the C1S peaks of calibrated Ag@Cu, Ag@Cu-1, Ag@Cu-5, Ag@Cu-10 and Ag@Cu-20 catalysts were at 285.04 eV, 284.98 eV, 284.96 eV, 284.97 eV and 284.93 eV. The excitation source of UPS was He Ⅰ line (the wavelength was 584 Å and the photon energy was 21.22 eV). The UPS spectrum collection range (kinetic energy) was 0～22 eV and the bias voltage of -5V was added to the spectrum acquisition, which separates the secondary electron cutoff edge from the instrument cutoff edge. The XPS spectrum was fitted by avantage software, and the FWHM and energy splitting were used to constrain the fitting process. After the preparation, the samples were stored in n-Hexane protected by argon at atmospheric pressure, degassed under the protection of argon, and then tested by XPS. The test step of XPS was 0.02 eV."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements The closed two-chamber electrolytic cell was used as CO2RR experimental device, and the electrolyte was potassium bicarbonate solution (0.1 M, PH = 6.8). In the experiment, platinum electrode was used as the counter electrode, calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode, and CHI-660E was used as the electrochemical workstation. Preparation of working electrode: uniform suspension was obtained by ultrasonic mixing of isopropanol and 5 wt% Nafion solution (DuPont) in 4.2 mg catalyst. Then the mixed suspension was coated on the 3 mm diameter glassy carbon electrode and dried at room temperature to make the working electrode. Argon (99.999%) was purged in the electrolyte for half an hour, and CO2 (20 ml/min) was injected to the electrolyte for more than half an hour to obtain a saturated CO2 solution. The electrochemical activity of the catalyst was determined by cyclic voltammetry and linear scanning. The impedance of the electrolysis process of the catalyst was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The test condition frequency was 1–105 Hz, potential −0.96V vs RHE, amplitude 5 mV. The stability of the catalyst was tested by chronoamperometry."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis Gas chromatography (SC–3000B, TDX-1 molecular sieve column) was used to detect gaseous products once per 30min. Different liquid products were distinguished by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Nuclear magnetic resonance sample preparation: 0.1 ml electrolyte mixed with internal standard solution (0.1 ml D2O containing 0.05 ml dimethyl sulfoxide). Faraday efficiency and conversion frequency were calculated by measuring the product and current value of the reaction for 5 h at constant potential. Faradaic efficiency of formate could be obtained from the Faraday law as follow： Faradaic efficiency ( ηformate , % ) = Q f o r m a t e Q t o t a l × 100 = n × F × m o l [ f o r m a t e ] i × t × 100 Where F was the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol−1) and n was the transferred electrons (2), mol [formate] was determined through the 1H NMR analysis."
6,Results and discussion,"To understand the effect of Cu–CuO interface on electrocatalytic activity, Ag@Cu-X (X = 1–60min) catalysts with different Cu–CuO interfaces were prepared by the preparation method shown in Fig. 1 a. Firstly, Ag NPs was prepared by reduction of silver acetylacetonate with tri-n-octyl phosphine. The surface of Ag nanoparticles was coated with Cu2O by chemical deposition and then Cu2O was reduced by formaldehyde to obtain Ag@Cu. At room temperature, the Ag@Cu catalyst was treated by air-plasma for different time to form Cu–CuO interface on the surface of Ag@Cu and the obtained catalyst was named Ag@Cu-X (X = 1–60min). The phase composition of different catalysts treated by plasma was studied by X-ray diffractometer. Fig. 1b, c showed that the XRD spectrum was mainly composed of diffraction peaks of two main phases, Ag and Cu, which was consistent with the standard cards of Ag JCPDS#04–0783 [38] and Cu JCPDS#04–0836 [39]. Spectrum analysis showed that the main components of the plasma treated catalyst Ag@Cu-X were still Ag and Cu. Interestingly, there was no CuO phase in the plasma treated catalyst, which may be that the content of CuO does not reach the detection limit of X-ray diffractometer. EPMA analysis results (Fig. 2 ) showed that the prepared material was Ag@Cu structure with Ag core and Cu shell. To observe the morphology of the catalyst after plasma treatment, the morphology and element distribution of the catalyst were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM). scanning electron microscope images of Ag@Cu (Fig. 3 (a, b)) showed that the untreated Ag@Cu had smooth surface. However, after plasma treatment, the surface gradually changes from smooth to rough (Fig. 3c, d). This was because during air-plasma treatment, Cu crystals were transformed into CuO crystals, thus protruding CuO particles were formed on the surface of Ag@Cu. The formation of these CuO particles causes the surface to change from smooth to rough gradually [40–42]. Fig. 3e, i can observe the obvious bright field in the center position of the HAADF-STEM diagram of the catalyst before and after treatment, while the edge position shows darker spots than the center position, indicating that the catalyst still maintains the coating structure. The element mapping diagrams of Ag@Cu and Ag@Cu-10 show that the surface of the catalyst was composed of Ag, Cu and O elements. Combined with the XRD results, the O element only exists on the surface of the catalyst, indicating that the interface precision of Cu–CuO prepared by plasma was much higher than that of calcination treatment. The composition and content of surface elements of different catalysts were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS full spectrum under different treatment time showed that the surface elements of the catalyst were composed of Ag, Cu, O and additional carbon. In addition, Fig. 4 a and Fig. 4b showed that the O content increases gradually with the increase of air-plasma treatment time, indicating that air-plasma treatment leads to the oxidation of the catalyst surface. As shown in Fig. 3c, the XPS fine spectrum of Cu 2p of Ag@Cu catalyst has a peak at the binding energy of 932.1 eV, 951.8 eV, 934.2 eV and 953.8 eV, which was attributed to the spin splitting of Cu 2p orbitals (Table 2). Among them, the binding energy peak of 932.1 eV was Cu0 [25]. The binding energy 934.2 eV was consistent with the binding energy (934 eV) of CuO reported in the article [43,44]. In addition, the binding energy of copper increases after plasma treatment, which was due to the decrease of valence electrons due to the increase of oxidation degree. The fine spectrum of Ag 3d (Fig. 3d) consists of Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2. The binding energy after peak separation and fitting was 373.4 eV [25], which belongs to Ag, indicating that Ag was not oxidized. Table 1 shows that with the increase of plasma treatment time, the content of Cu and O on the surface increases obviously, while the content of Ag decreases. Due to the appearance of surface CuO, the Cu shell of Ag@Cu was thickened. However, XPS belongs to surface (1–10 nm) detection technology, and the Ag coated by Cu and CuO gradually exceeds the detection depth of XPS, so the content of Ag decreases in XPS detection. At the same time, this result also verifies that Ag was covered by Cu. According to the comprehensive characterization analysis, the Cu–CuO interface was formed on the Ag@Cu surface by plasma treatment. To detect the effect of Cu–CuO interface on the activity of CO2RR, the slurry of the catalyst was coated on the glassy carbon electrode to make a working electrode to test the performance of CO2RR. The linear sweep voltammetry curves of all catalysts were obtained by scanning potential from 0.64 to −1.16 V vs RHE (sweep rate 50 mV s−1). The scanning potential of cyclic voltammetry was 0.64 to −1.16 V vs RHE and the scanning speed was 100 mV s−1. The voltage of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was −0.96 V vs RHE and the frequency was 1–105 Hz. All electrolytes were 0.1 M KHCO3 solution. Fig. 5 a shows the linear sweep voltammetry of different catalysts. The current density of the catalysts with different plasma treatment time increased and then decreased gradually. Among them, Ag@Cu-10 catalyst had the highest current density of about 13 mA cm−2, which indicates that the thickness of catalyst oxide layer was the best when 10 min was treated by plasma. The current density of Ag@Cu-10 was about 2 times that of Ag@Cu, and Ag@Cu-10 had a higher initial potential, indicating that the existence of surface oxide layer improves the activity of electrolytic reaction. The change of impedance with sine wave frequency was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). It was observed from Fig. 5c that the impedance increases at first and then decreases with the increase of plasma treatment time, which was consistent with the trend of LSV. Ag@Cu has a large electrochemical impedance, indicating that the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the catalyst was slow. However, Ag@Cu-10 with Cu–CuO interface had the lowest electrochemical impedance, which indicates that the surface oxide layer makes CO2 more easily activated. The hindrance of the electrode process was studied by Tafel slope, the results were shown in Fig. 5d. With the increase of plasma treatment time, the Tafel slope decreases at first and then increases. Among them, the Tafel slopes of Ag@Cu and Ag@Cu-10 were 197 mV ·dec-1 and 128 mV ·dec-1, which indicates that the reaction kinetics of Ag@Cu was slower than that of Ag@Cu-10. The potential of the Tafel slope calculation point was lower than-1.0V (vs.RHE), which avoids the sharp change of the slope at a more negative potential. These results indicate that the formation of lower alcohols on Ag@Cu-10 was significantly faster than that of Ag@Cu, indicating that a suitable Cu–CuO interface can greatly increase the reaction rate. The increase of current density indicates that the reaction kinetics of electrolysis was enhanced, but it does not mean that the performance of CO2RR was improved, because the reaction of electrolytic water and CO2RR usually occur together. To verify that the appearance of the Cu–CuO interface mainly promotes the performance of CO2RR, the catalyst was electrolyzed at a constant voltage of-0.8V for 5 h, and the products of the electrolysis process of different catalysts were collected to calculate the Faraday efficiency. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis showed that the liquid phase products were low-carbon alcohols (methanol, ethanol). Fig. 5a showed that the Faraday efficiency of light alcohols gradually increased from 45.6% (Ag@Cu) to 65.5% (Ag@Cu-10) and the Faraday efficiency increased by 19.9%. In addition, we also observed that when the thickness of the CuO layer increased, the faraday efficiency of ethanol increased from 2.7% to 33.5% and the faraday efficiency of methanol decreased by 9.1%. According to Nitopi [45], methanol and ethanol have the same intermediate *CO,*CO hydrogenation to produce methanol and *CO coupling to produce ethanol, which indicates that the Cu–CuO interface can greatly promote the C–C coupling reaction. Then the Ag@Cu-10 catalyst with the best electrochemical activity was electrolyzed at different voltages, the results were shown in Fig. 6 b. The lowest H2 Faraday efficiency (10.2%) was observed a t-0.8 V vs RHE, HER was suppressed. At −0.9 V vs RHE, the catalyst has the highest low-carbon alcohols yield (66.6%), including methanol yield of 42.5% and ethanol yield of 24.1%. To study the CO2RR stability of Cu–CuO interface. At −0.8 V vs. RHE, the Ag@Cu-10 catalyst was electrolyzed for long time with constant voltage for 60 h to collect current data and the products were collected to calculate the faraday efficiency. As shown in Fig. 7 , the current density (−4.8∼-4.2 mA cm−2) remains stable and >70% Faraday efficiency of low-carbon alcohols during continuous electrolysis at-0.8 V vs. RHE for 60 h. Ag@Cu-10 shows excellent CO2RR durability. We further carried out an electron probe microanalysis test on the electrolyzed catalyst to analyze the changes before and after the electrolysis of the catalyst. The results showed (Figs. 2 and 8 ) that the morphology of the catalyst did not change significantly. However, the oxygen content on the catalyst surface is greatly increased (10%–32%). Hori [46] found that during the long-term electrolysis of Cu-based catalysts, the increase of Cu oxides would hinder the contact of CO2 with the catalytically active sites on the Cu-based catalyst, leading to the gradual deactivation of the catalyst. Therefore, we conclude that the decrease in activity may be due to the increase in oxygen content (Table 3 )."
7,Conclusion,"In conclusion, the effects of air plasma treatment on the structure of Ag@Cu bimetallic catalyst and the electrocatalytic reduction performance of CO2 were discussed. XRD, TEM, XPS and analytical EDX elemental mapping show that air plasma treatment results in the formation of Cu–CuO interface on the surface of Ag@Cu and the Cu–CuO interface significantly improves the performance of CO2RR. By controlling the plasma treatment time, the Ag@Cu-10 catalyst with the most obvious improvement in CO2RR performance was obtained. Compared with Ag@Cu, Ag@Cu-10 catalyst significantly enhanced the production of low-carbon alcohols, with a Faraday efficiency of up to 65.5%. The above results prove that an appropriate ratio of Cu–CuO interface iswas beneficial to the improvement of CO2 activation efficiency and reaction selectivity, promotes the electro-reduction of CO2 to produce low-carbon alcohols. In short, this work provides valuable clues for the surface Cu–CuO interface generation and CO2 electrocatalysis to produce high value-added fuels."
