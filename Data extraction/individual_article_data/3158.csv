0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean source of energy. Combustion of hydrogen produces no greenhouse gases, and has a high-energy yield of 122kJ/g, which is 2.75-fold greater than that of hydrocarbon fuels. Thus, using hydrogen as a clean energy source seems to be promising (Nath and Das, 2004). The feasibility of applying fermentation of organic wastes to produce hydrogen has been widely demonstrated at various laboratories (Yu et al., 2002; Hussy et al., 2003; Nath and Das, 2004). Both pure cultures such as Clostridium sp. and mixed cultures of anaerobic bacteria have been used to convert various carbohydrates to hydrogen in previous studies (Taguchi et al., 1992; Ueno et al., 1995; Lay, 2001). For example, a pure strain of Clostridium could produce hydrogen in a continuous culture at pH 6.0 when xylose was used as a substrate (Taguchi et al., 1995). Hydrogen was produced at a rate of 1600ml-H2/l/day and a yield of 2.14mol-H2/mol-hexose when a mixed culture was employed to ferment a 0.75% solution of soluble starch (Lay, 2000). Kinetic models could be used to describe relationship among the principal state variables and to explain the behavior of fermentation quantitatively. In addition, it can provide useful information for the analysis, design and operation of a fermentation process. Kinetic models are normally divided into two classes: structured and unstructured one. Structured models take metabolic pathways into consideration and are generally complicated. A structured model for acetone–butanol fermentations was established by Votruba et al. (1985). In this model the biochemical and physiological aspects of growth and metabolite synthesis were considered simultaneously, and the key fermentation rates were expressed and evaluated with regard to substrate consumption and end-product inhibitory effects. On the other hand, the unstructured kinetic models are much simpler than the structured ones (Ŏzilgen, 1998). In the unstructured kinetic models microorganisms are usually considered to be a component or reactant in the system. The unstructured kinetic models are the most frequently employed for modeling microbial systems because they are simple, but are good enough for technical purposes (Chen et al., 2001; Hu et al., 2002; Fujikawa et al., 2004). During the anaerobic hydrogen production from organic wastes, in addition to hydrogen, carbon dioxide, various volatile fatty acids (VFA), and sometimes alcohols, are simultaneously produced. Thus, this is a complex multiproduct process. Depending on operating conditions, the distribution of the acidogenic products varies substantially. Furthermore, some acidogenic products, e.g., acetate, butyrate, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, may form more complex long-chain fatty acids or alcohols as the hydrogen is consumed (Yu et al., 2004). In this case, it is almost impossible to establish structured models to describe such a multiproduct process, but unstructured models might be a better option. However, few studies have been carried out on unstructured models to describe the kinetics of biological hydrogen production by mixed anaerobic cultures. Therefore, in this study unstructured models were used to describe the kinetics of biological hydrogen production from sucrose by mixed anaerobic cultures in a batch mode, including substrate utilization, biomass growth and product formation. In addition, relationship between substrate, biomass and products was also evaluated. The results from this study were expected to be helpful for understanding the behavior of anaerobic hydrogen production process."
1,Methods,
2,Hydrogen-producing sludge,"2.1 Hydrogen-producing sludge The anaerobic microflora used in this study was obtained from a full-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating citrate-producing wastewater located Benpu, China. Prior to use, the seed sludge was heated at 102°C for 90min to inactivate the hydrogentrophic methanogens and to enrich the hydrogen-producing bacteria as described by van Ginkel et al. (2001)."
3,Experiments,"2.2 Experiments Hydrogen production experiments were carried out in a 5-l fermentor (Baoxin Biotech Ltd., Shanghai). One liter hydrogen-producing sludge with volatile suspended solids (VSS) of 15.2gl−1 and 3ml of nutrients solution were added to the fermentor. The working volume of the fermentor was adjusted to 3.0l with distilled water. The solution in the fermentor was composed as follows (unit in mgl−1): NH4HCO3 2025; K2HPO4 ·3H2O 800; CaCl2 50; MgCl2 ·6H2O 100; FeCl2 25; NaCl 10; CoCl2 ·6H2O 5; MnCl2 ·4H2O 5; AlCl3 2.5; (NH4)6Mo7O24 15; H3BO4 5; NiCl2 ·6H2O 5; CuCl2 ·5H2O 5; ZnCl2 5. Prior to operation, the fermentor was purged with nitrogen gas for 10min to ensure anaerobic condition. The pH of the mixed liquor was kept at constant by feeding 4M NaOH or 2M HCl solutions via respective peristaltic pumps. The agitation rate in the fermentor was kept at 120rpm. A biogas sampling port was installed between the meter and the reactor to allow direct biogas sampling with a syringe. A 10-ml liquor sample was taken from reactor at each given interval and was analyzed. In this trail, the pH was chosen as 5.5, which was optimum for hydrogen production by mixed anaerobic cultures obtained by many previous studies (van Ginkel et al., 2001; Fan et al., 2004). The temperature and substrate concentration was 35.0°C and 30gl−1, respectively. Moreover, the trial was replicated at least three times and results averaged."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The amount of biogas produced was recorded using water-replace equipment. The biogas contents were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Lunan, Model SP-6800A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 1.5m stainless-steel column packed with 5Å molecular sieve. The temperatures of injector, detector and column were kept at 100°C, 105°C and 60°C, respectively. Argon was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 30mlmin−1. The concentrations of VFA, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate in the effluent were determined by second gas chromatograph (Agilent, Model 6890NT) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30m×0.25mm×0.25μm fused-silica capillary column (DB-FFAP). The liquor samples were first centrifuged at 12000rpm for 5min, and were then acidified by formic acid and filtrated through 0.2μm membrane and finally measured for free acids. The temperatures of the injector and detector were 250°C and 300°C, respectively. The initial temperature of oven was 70°C for 3min followed with a ramp of 20°Cmin−1 for 5.5min and to final temperature of 180°C for 3min. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 2.6mlmin−1. Sucrose concentration was measured using enthrone–sulfuric acid method (Koeher, 1952). VSS concentration was measured according to the Standard Methods (APHA, 1995)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Kinetics of substrate utilization,"3.1 Kinetics of substrate utilization The Michaelis–Menten equation was used to model the substrate degradation as follows (Wu et al., 2002): (1) v = v m S k m + S where v (gg-VSS−1 h−1) is the specific substrate degradation rate; v m (gg-VSS−1 h−1) is the maximum specific substrate degradation rate; k m (gl−1) is the dissociation constant; and S (gl−1) is the substrate concentration. Linearization of Eq. (1) gives: (2) 1 v = k m v m 1 S + 1 v m Plotting 1/v against 1/S, a straight line was obtained with an intercept of 1/v m and a slope of k m/v m. This plot is shown in Fig. 1 , from which v m and k m were estimated as 0.28gg-VSS−1 h−1 and 13.5gl−1, respectively. The regression line had a correlation coefficient of 0.963, suggesting the applicability of Eq. (1). The k m value represents the substrate concentration required to achieve 50% of the maximum specific substrate degradation rate. This item could be used for adjusting the most appropriate substrate concentration in the feed."
7,Kinetics of microbial growth,"3.2 Kinetics of microbial growth The Logistic model (Eq. (3)) was adapted to describe the kinetics of the microbial growth (Fujikawa et al., 2004): (3) d X d t = k c X 1 - X X max where k c (h−1) is the apparent specific growth rate; X (g-VSSl−1) is the microbial concentration; and X max (gl−1) is the maximum microbial concentration. Integration of Eq. (3) gives the following equation for microbial concentration: (4) X = X 0 exp ( k c t ) 1 - ( X 0 / X max ) ( 1 - exp ( k c t ) ) where X 0 (gl−1) is the initial microbial concentration (g-VSSl−1). Although the predictive power of Eq. (4) may be limited since it does not involve a substrate term (Panikov, 1995), the logistic model is a fair approximation of the microbial growth curve for the batch hydrogen production experiments in this study, due to constant values of the initial substrate concentrations and the inoculation volume. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between the microbial concentration and cultivation time, including both experimental data and fitted curve obtained based on the logistic model. Correspondingly, the logistic model parameters of k c and X max were estimated as 0.07h−1 and 9.46g-VSSl−1, respectively. The R 2 value, as a measure of the goodness of the fit, was about 0.954, indicating excellent agreement of the model to the experimental data. Moreover, the measured X max, 9.14g-VSSl−1, was close to the estimated value by the Logistic model, 9.46g-VSSl−1."
8,Kinetics of product formation,"3.3 Kinetics of product formation In this study, the desirable gaseous product from the acidogenesis of sucrose was hydrogen, whereas the main aqueous products were butyrate and acetate. Therefore, the formation kinetics of hydrogen, butyrate and acetate were focused. A modified Gompertz equation was employed to model the formation of product (van Ginkel et al., 2001; Lin and Lay, 2004): (5) P i = P max , i exp - exp R max , i × e P max , i ( λ i - t ) + 1 where i represents hydrogen, butyrate and acetate respectively; P i is the product i formed per liter of reactor volume at fermentation time t; P max,i is the potential maximum product formed per liter of reactor volume; R max,i is the maximum rate of product formed; is the lag time to exponential product formed. The fitted curves are shown in Fig. 3 and the parameters estimated for the formation of various products are summarized in Table 1 . All correlation coefficients of non-linear analysis by Eq. (5) was over 0.990, suggesting that the modified Gompertz equation was able to adequately describe the formation of various products for anaerobic hydrogen production by mixed cultures."
9,Relationship between biomass and products,"3.4 Relationship between biomass and products The relationship between biomass and the products for the anaerobic hydrogen production by mixed anaerobic cultures could be simulated by the Luedeking–Piret model: (6) d P i d t = α i d X d t + β i X where α i is the growth-associated formation coefficient of product i; β i is non-growth-associated formation coefficient of product i. This model was originally proposed for describing the lactic acid production by Lactobacillus delbrucckii (Luedeking and Piret, 1959). The first term of Eq. (6), i.e., α i dX/dt, is referred as the growth-associated formation rate of product i. This implies that the growing cells produce the product in constant proportion of their growth. Non-growth associated product formation term (β i X) shows that all the microorganisms produce the product i in a constant proportion of their concentration, regardless of the growth phase. Eq. (6) could be changed into: d P i X d t = α i d X X d t + β i or (7) d P i X d t = α i μ + β i where dP i/dt/X is the specific formation rate of product i; and μ is the specific growth rate of the microorganisms. A straight line could be obtained with an intercept of β i and a slope of α i, if plotting dP i/dt/X against μ. The fitted plots are shown in Fig. 4 for the three products (hydrogen, butyrate and acetate). The high correlation coefficients indicate that the Luedeking–Piret model could properly describe the relationship between biomass and product in the anaerobic hydrogen production process. The estimated values of α and β, indicating the dependence of product formation and biomass concentration, are shown in Table 2 . These values could be used to predict the productivity in the bioreactor design. Since all β values were zero in Table 2, the formation of hydrogen, butyrate and acetate in the anaerobic hydrogen production was associate-growth."
10,Relationship between substrate and products,"3.5 Relationship between substrate and products Since the formation of product was associate-growth for the anaerobic hydrogen production by mixed anaerobic cultures, the correlation between product i and substrate could be expressed as Eqs. (8) and (9) (Yang et al., 1988): (8) d P i d t = - Y P i d S d t (9) d P i = - Y P i d S ∫ 0 P i d P i = - Y P i ∫ S 0 S d S P i = Y P i ( S 0 - S ) where Y P i is the yield of product i. Solution of Eq. (9) is plotted in Fig. 5 and the estimated Y P values for hydrogen, butyrate and acetate are summarized in Table 3 . The high correlation coefficients in Table 3 suggest that the relationship between products and substrate could be simulated by Eq. (8) successfully. The yields of hydrogen, butyrate and acetate were estimated as 143mlg−1, 0.35gg−1 and 0.030gg−1, respectively."
11,Conclusions,"With the experimental results of batch hydrogen production by mixed anaerobic cultures, unstructured models were used to describe the substrate utilization, biomass growth and product formation in this process. The Michaelis–Menten equation, Logistic model and modified Gompertz equation could respectively describe the kinetics of substrate utilization, biomass growth and product formation very well, while Luedeking–Piret model was able to simulate the relationship between acidogenic products and biomass. The experimental results also suggest that the formation of hydrogen, butyrate and acetate was all growth-associated."
