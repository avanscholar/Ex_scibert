0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a valuable and versatile fuel that can be utilized in many purposes such as traffic, heat and power production. Nowadays most of the hydrogen is produced in steam reforming process, which is very energy intensive and not sustainable [1]. For this reason further research is directed to other more environmentally friendly hydrogen production methods. One of the promising techniques is dark fermentation, where anaerobic bacteria can utilize organic wastes to produce hydrogen. The challenge of this process is that H2 production is accompanied by the production of soluble end products such as volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols and additional step for chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal is needed [2]. On the other hand organic acids and alcohols are suitable substrates for methane production [3]. Therefore two stage combined hydrogen and methane production process could offer an efficient solution. First stage is optimized for hydrogen production and second stage for methane production by adjusting process parameters, such as pH and hydraulic retention time (HRT). By separating these two phases can offer several advantages compared to single stage process. With particulate substrates hydrolysis and acidification are improved as they are controlled in first stage in separate reactor [4]. This also increases the stability of the process. In addition the energy recovery is maximized since hydrogen is recovered and methane production is improved [4,5]. Hydrogen can be produced in wide temperature range from psychrophilic (<25 °C) to extreme thermophilic conditions (>70 °C) [6–8]. Usually higher temperatures are preferred and especially extreme thermophilic conditions seem to offer several advantages. It has been confirmed that due to better thermodynamics and higher rate of hydrolysis in extreme thermophilic (≤70 °C) conditions hydrogen yields can reach close to theoretical maximum (4 mol/mol glucose) [9–12]. High temperature also offers better pathogen removal, which is important especially when treating waste materials [13]. Methane production has also proved to be possible in extreme thermophilic condition, but for methane production higher temperatures may lead process instability and especially in extreme temperatures yields have been low [14–17]. However some industrial processes especially in pulp and paper industry produce hot and concentrated process water streams, which in economical point of view would be feasible to treat without cooling especially if the water is circulated back to the process. Upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactors and its modifications such as internal circulation (IC) and expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactors have been used widely to anaerobic treatment of industrial wastewaters and to produce methane. Also hydrogen production in UASB reactor system has gained interest, as it seems to be more stable than other reactor systems [18]. The main feature of the UASB reactor is the formation of anaerobic granules [19]. The granules have high settling properties, which leads to good biomass retention and allows high loading with short HRT, also in thermophilic conditions [20]. In this paper two-stage hydrogen and methane production was studied in extreme thermophilic conditions, by using UASB reactors. Also batch experiments were conducted to compare methanogenic activity of the sludge grown in extreme thermophilic UASB at 70 and 55 °C."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reactor setup,"2.1 Reactor setup The two-stage process consisted of two UASB-reactors for hydrogen and methane production with volumes of 200 ml (diameter 3.2 cm, height 28.8 cm) and 500 ml diameter 4.7 cm, height 36.2 cm respectively (Fig. 1 ). Feed was continuously pumped (Masterflex) into hydrogen reactor from two different feed containers for glucose and BA-media separately. Feed was kept at 4 °C. Effluent from hydrogen reactor was collected daily in the container at room temperature. Then, sodium bicarbonate buffer (5 g/l) was added, and the effluent was used as feed for methane reactor. Both UASB reactors were kept at 70 °C by circulating hot water in rubber hose surrounding reactors. HRT and OLR were 5 h and 25.1 kg COD/m3/d, and 13 h and 7.8 kg COD/m3/d for hydrogen and methane reactor, respectively."
3,Substrate and inoculum,"2.2 Substrate and inoculum Granular sludge from mesophilic IC reactor treating vegetable processing wastewater (Lännen tehtaat Oyj, Säkylä, Finland) was used as inoculum for both hydrogen and methane reactors. Inoculum was first acclimated for extreme thermophilic conditions, by running reactors for 30 days at 70 °C with process parameters stated in Section 2.1. Then reactors were stopped. Meanwhile inoculum was stored at 4 °C in anaerobic conditions to minimise microbial decay and loss of microbial activity. For actual run 140 ml and 350 ml of adapted granular sludge were added to hydrogen and methane reactor, respectively. The feed of hydrogen reactor consisted of glucose solution (5 g/l) and BA-media. BA-media was prepared according to [21] without resazurin and NaHCO3."
4,Batch experiment,2.3 Batch experiment Set of batch assays were conducted to assess the methanogenic activity of the 70 °C methane reactor sludge at both 70 °C and at 55 °C. Batch assays were carried in triplicates in 120 ml serum vials with liquid volume of 60 ml. Each vial contained 15 gww of sludge from 70 °C methane reactor and 45 ml of effluent from hydrogen reactor. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) buffer (5 g/l) was added to each vial. Sludge and effluent for the assays were collected at the end of reactor experiment on day 73. Vials were closed with butyl rubber stoppers and sealed with aluminium caps. Headspace of each vial was flushed with nitrogen gas to assure anaerobic conditions. Assays were conducted at 55 and 70 °C and gas volumes were corrected to standard temperature (0 °C) and pressure (760 mm Hg).
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis Gas composition (CH4, H2 and CO2) was analyzed with a Perkin Elmer Arnel Clarus 500 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Supelco Carboxen™ 1010 PLOT fused silica capillary column (30 m * 0.53 mm). Argon (15 ml/min) was used as the carrier gas and the temperatures of the oven, detector and injector were 200, 230 and 225 °C, respectively. The pH was measured with a Mettler Toledo Seven Easy pH meter. VFAs and alcohols were analyzed with a Perkin Elmer Autosystem XL gas chromatograph equipped with a flame-ionization detector (FID) and a HP-INNOWax column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm). Helium was used as a carrier gas and the temperature of the oven, detector and injector were 100–160, 225 and 230 °C respectively. Glucose was analyzed with phenol–sulphuric acid method according to [22]. COD was analyzed according to SFS 5504 [23]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Inoculum acclimation,"3.1 Inoculum acclimation Mesophilic granular sludge was first acclimated for extreme thermophilic conditions running the two stage reactor system for 30 days at 70 °C. During acclimation period hydrogen production started immediately and on fifth day of operation hydrogen content in gas phase was around 60% in hydrogen reactor (data not shown). Methane reactor was initially run without buffer addition to find out if the methane reactor could sustain its optimum pH level without buffer, but subsequently pH decreased down to 4.5. Hydrogen content fluctuated between 30 and 45% and methane content stayed under 10%. As buffer was added on day 20 onward, hydrogen content in gas phase started to decline (below 0.5%) and methane content in gas phase rose to 36% on day 29. Extreme thermophilic methane [24] and hydrogen producing reactors working at 70 °C, and even 80 °C have been inoculated with mesophilic granular sludges successfully also previously [25]. In this study the same mesophilic granular sludge was able to facilitate both hydrogen and methane production in extreme thermophilic temperatures, which with other studies indicates that extreme thermophilic micro-organisms can also be found in mesophilic environments. In fact it's been confirmed that bacterial species specified as extreme thermophiles can actually have quite wide temperature range from mesophilic to extreme thermophilic. For example extreme thermophile Vulcanithermus mediatlanticus, enriched from deep-sea hot vent has its optimum at 70 °C, but is able to grow at temperatures between 37 and 80 °C [26]."
8,Hydrogen production stage,"3.2 Hydrogen production stage Two-stage process aiming to produce hydrogen and methane was operated with mixed acclimized culture in extreme thermophilic conditions at 70 °C. In hydrogen reactor, operated with HRT of 5 h and OLR of 25.1 kg COD/m3/d, hydrogen was produced variably from the beginning and on third day hydrogen content of gas phase reached over 50%. From day 55 onward, when hydrogen content in gas phase was stabilised around 50% average hydrogen production rate was 2.07 l H2/l reactor volume/d, giving a hydrogen yield of 0.73 mol/mol glucoseadded. No methane was detected during operation (Table 1 ). Hydrogen yield was lower than previously reported for extreme thermophilic hydrogen production. Hydrogen yield of 2.47 mol/mol was reported earlier at 70 °C in UASB reactor system [8] and in batch assays with pure cultures hydrogen yields close to theoretical maximum (4 mol/mol glucose) have been achieved at 70 and 65 °C [27,28]. The present low hydrogen yield could be either caused by characteristic of inoculum or a result of substrate overloading leading in accumulation of acidic end products. This was followed by decrease in pH, which was around 3.7 by self-adjustment. pH at 4 or below have been reported to inhibit hydrogen production [29–31] whereas 5–6 is usually considered optimal [32]. However for extreme thermophilic conditions pH around 7 is found to be optimal for hydrogen production [27,28,33]. Also the substrate utilization was incomplete, which could be caused by short HRT leading to limited hydrolysis, as only 67% of glucose was consumed during operation. Normally over 95% conversions have been achieved in hydrogen production processes, but with longer retention times, typically from 12 to 24 h in UASBs [8,34]. The present applied HRT of 5 h in hydrogen reactor was consider maximum to keep the two stage application competitive over one stage methanogenic system, and thus higher HRTs were not studied. On the other hand, higher HRT during start-up of the process could probably facilitate enrichment of hydrolytic cultures in the hydrogen reactor. Nevertheless COD removal efficiency fluctuated over time from 8 to 24%, which is considered typical for acidogenic phase, since glucose is mainly converted to soluble metabolic end products, here mainly butyric acid 300–540 mg/l, acetic acid 260–400 mg/l and ethanol 50–350 mg/l (Fig. 2 ). This could indicate mixed-acid type fermentation, which is different from other extreme thermophilic studies, where acetic acid fermentation was more common [25,33]."
9,Methane production stage,"3.3 Methane production stage In second stage methane was produced by converting residual organic matters present in the effluent of hydrogen reactor. In the methane reactor operated with HRT of 13 h and OLR of 7.8 kg COD/m3/d, it was shown that also methane could be produced in extreme thermophilic conditions. However, it took 42 days before methane content in gas phase reached over 50% (Fig. 3 ). When methane content in gas phase was stabilised around 53% average methane production rate was 0.9 l CH4/l reactor volume/d, giving methane yield of 117.5 ml/g CODadded (Table 1). The yield was low, but this was accordance with previous study with extreme thermophilic temperatures, where methane production was severely decreased when process temperature in UASB type reactor was increased to 65 °C [35]. It seems that activity of VFA consuming methanogens is prevented in higher temperatures and methane production proceeds mainly through hydrogenotrophic pathway, where methane is produced from hydrogen and carbon dioxide [14,36,37]. This results in lower methane yields, since only 30% of methane is normally produced via this pathway [3]. Lower activity of acetic acid consuming methanogens can also lead to accumulation of VFAs. After hydrogen production stage rest of the glucose was degraded, but COD still remained over 3000 mg/l, with removal of around 23% in methane stage (or 24–44% for overall two stage process). VFA was not fully utilized and the concentration was higher than in hydrogen reactor effluent, which implies that hydrolysis was not complete in hydrogen reactor and on the other hand, micro-organisms in methane reactor were not able to utilize all acids for methane production. The main VFAs in effluent were acetic acid 270–2200 mg/l, butyric acid 310–755 mg/l and propionic acid 16–690 mg/l (Fig. 3). Lepistö & Rintala [38] also reported poor effluent quality at 70–76 °C UASBs, when VFAs were used as feed. They suspected that high temperature caused sludge granules to degrade which led to increased COD concentrations in effluent."
10,Batch experiments,"3.4 Batch experiments The assays with the methane reactor sludge (sampled at the end of the run) were performed using effluent from hydrogen reactor and assays were incubated for 150 days. Methane production started immediately at both 55 and 70 °C, but at much lower rate at 70 °C in which it also rapidly ceased at low level even for the long incubation period. At 55 °C methane production was much higher than at 70 °C (Fig. 4 ). It's been shown that methane production in extreme thermophilic conditions is possible, but production is more efficient in lower temperatures. It seems that activity of methane producers is significantly reduced at temperatures over 65–68 °C [37,39]. On the other hand extreme thermophilic conditions seem to favour hydrogen production and hydrolysis [14,15]. Nevertheless based on this and previous studies it is suggested that optimal temperature conditions for two stage hydrogen and methane production are 70 °C and 55 °C, respectively."
11,Energy efficiency of two-stage process,"3.5 Energy efficiency of two-stage process In this study 1 kg of glucose produced 72.3 l of H2 and 80.1 l of CH4 in two stage 70 °C UASB system. This corresponds to 0.26 kW h/kg glucose and 0.88 kW h/kg glucose for hydrogen and methane respectively. Therefore the total equivalent energy produced is 1.14 kW h/kg, which is 26% of energy content of 1 kg of glucose. In extreme thermophilic conditions hydrogen yield could be expected to be higher even close to 4 mol/mol glucose, which would correspond to 1.76 kW h/kg. As stated in Chapter 3.4, methane production could also be increased by lowering the temperature. Batch experiment proved that methane production was higher at 55 than 70 °C. Based on methane production from batch, calculated total equivalent energy produced was 2.84 kW h/kg. In the two stage UASB system from total energy produced 22% came from hydrogen and 78% from methane. Energy yield of hydrogen is remarkably lower than methane owing to lower heating value per volume. However, as proved in previous studies hydrogen production as separate stage, can offer several advantages compared to single stage methane production. With cassava stillage as substrate the two stage process was more stable compared to one stage methane production [40]. In several studies with solid substrates methane production was improved and more efficient removal of organic content was achieved. Also the overall energy efficiency of the process is increased with hydrogen production [5,41]."
12,Conclusions,"In this laboratory study hydrogen and methane production in two stage UASB reactor system at extreme thermophilic conditions was demonstrated successfully for the first time. It was proved that hydrogen as well as methane can be produced in extreme thermophilic conditions by inoculating reactors with sludge originating from mesophilic conditions. Hydrogen production was 0.73 mol/mol glucoseadded (or 85.1 ml/g CODadded), which was lower than reported previously and was probably caused by too high loading and incomplete hydrolysis. Methane production was low 117.5 ml/g CODadded in the extreme temperatures and results from batch experiment proposed that lower temperature (55 °C) for methane production would be preferred."
