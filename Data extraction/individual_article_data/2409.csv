0,Introduction,"Hydrogenation of CO2 into highly valuable chemicals like alcohols is of great significance, which not only benefits to relieve the greenhouse effect induced by CO2 but also provides a way for turning CO2 as C1 building blocks [1–10]. Especially, ethanol as a renewable fuel additive and eminent engine fuels with higher energy density is one of the most desirable products from CO2 hydrogenation compared with other C1 products, such as CO, CH4 and CH3OH [11]. However, achieving high activity of CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol is a challenging task because CO2 is a thermodynamically stable and chemically inert molecule, which makes the conversion efficiency extremely low and correspondingly requires high temperatures to trigger the catalytic reactions (> 200 °C). Furthermore, the formation of ethanol from CO2 hydrogenation is thermodynamically limited due to the preferential production of CO or CH4, which leads to extremely low selectivity to ethanol. Homogeneous catalysts are effective for CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol but those catalysts are not environmentally friendly and difficult to separate from the products and/or recycled [12,13]. Therefore, extensive efforts including the use of promoters [14–17], bimetallic catalysts [17–22], oxide composites [23,24] and constructing interfacial sites of supported metal catalysts [25,26] have been devoted to developing heterogeneous catalysts with the aim of harvesting high selectivity and activity for CO2 hydrogenation. However, it is still a challenging task to obtain high catalytic selectivity (> 99 %) with reasonable activity for CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. The effective cleavage of CO bond and efficient coupling of CC (C2) is the key step for the formation of ethanol [18,23,27]. Hence, constructing atom-precision active sites may benefit to efficiently activate CO bond and trigger C2 coupling but possibly inhibit the further C2+ coupling, which may benefit to selectively form ethanol. The recently developed single-atom catalysts (SACs) provide a novel strategy to precisely manipulate the structure and composition of active sites at atomic level [28–38]. The atom-precision active sites in SACs have demonstrated the excellent selectivity for various challenging but highly important catalytic transformations [34,39–41]. Herein, we report that CeO2 supported Pd dimers (denoted as Pd2/CeO2) with unique two-atom geometric configuration enable easy cleavage of CO bond and efficiently drive CC coupling, which gives a selectivity of 99.2 % to ethanol for CO2 hydrogenation with a space-time yield of 45.6 gethanol gPd −1 h−1, outperforming most of the active catalysts for this reaction in the public literature. The density functional theory (DFT) simulation further reveals that the unique two-atom structure of Pd dimers enables to activate CO2 easily via direct dissociation to form CO intermediate over Pd2/CeO2 and Pd dimers strongly bind CO, which prevents CO desorption and promotes the coupling between CO and CH3 intermediates to form the precursor of ethanol. As a result, the formation of ethanol on Pd dimers is promoted compared with that of Pd particles."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Pd dimers were dispersed onto the surface of CeO2 nanorods via an adsorption method [42–46]. The precursors of Pd were palladium nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich). All the materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. In details: 2.1.1 Preparation of Pd2/CeO2 Firstly, the CeO2 support with nanorods morphology was synthesized by a hydrothermal method as reported in our previous study [4]. The synthesized CeO2 nanorods with oxygen vacancies possessed excellent redox ability [47]. Then, the CeO2 nanorods were dispersed in the aqueous solution and the corresponding Pd precursors were slowly dropped in above mixture solution by using the peristaltic pump. The pH of Pd precursor solution was strictly controlled to be 3.5–4.5 to form the dimer-configuration of Pd complex in the solution. After stirring at room temperature for 2 h, the mixture was filtered out and then the obtained sample was dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The samples were calcined in air at 300 °C for 4 h. The actual Pd loading is 0.13 wt.% as measured by ICP-OES (AGILENT ICP-OES 730). 2.1.2 Nano-Pd/CeO2 preparation The CeO2 supported nano-Pd particles (nano-Pd/CeO2) catalyst was also prepared as the control catalyst. The corresponding Pd precursors were firstly reduced by the NaBH4 to form the nano-meter sized Pd particles then the above solution was slowly dropped in the aqueous solution mixing with CeO2 nanorods. After stirring at room temperature for 2 h, the mixture was filtered out and then the obtained catalyst was dried at 60 °C for 12 h in air. The actual Pd loading is 1.90 wt.% as measured by ICP-OES."
3,Evaluation of the catalytic performance,"2.2 Evaluation of the catalytic performance All catalytic tests were performed in a pressurized fixed-bed flow reactor (i.d. 8 mm). Without the pre-reduction treatment, a feed gas of 72.7 %H2/24.3 %CO2/3%N2 was directly introduced into the reactor and the pressure was increased to 3 MPa. After that, the reaction temperature was raised progressively to 240 °C to start the reaction. The effluent products were analyzed on-line by one gas chromatography (Agilent GC-7820A) with two detectors. The thermal conductivity detector (TCD) equipped with MS 5A packed column is used to analyze H2, CO, CH4, CO2 and N2 (an internal standard substance), while the flame ionization detector (FID) with RT®-Q Bond capillary column is for C2H5OH, CH3OH, CH4 and higher hydrocarbons analysis. The calculation details of conversion, product selectivity and turnover frequency (TOF) can be found in Supporting Information, in which the TOF values are calculated based on the exposed Pd atoms."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization HAADF-STEM images are collected on a JEM-ARM200 F TEM/STEM with a resolution of 0.08 nm. Before collecting data, the samples are dispersed by ultrasonicator in ethanol. Then a droplet of dispersed sample solution is dropped onto a copper grid coated with lacey carbon film. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of CO adsorption on Pd/CeO2 catalysts was conducted on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer with a MCT detector. The in-situ cell was equipped with CaF2 windows. The DRIFTS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and 64 scans, and the data was recorded in Kubelka−Munk units. When collecting the data of CO-DRIFTS on Pd2/CeO2 and nano-Pd/CeO2 samples, the samples were firstly heated at 120 °C for 40 min to remove the possible H2O and other impurities on the surface. And then the samples were cooled down to 30 °C and the background spectrum was collected before the background was stable. Then CO (0.3 vol.% CO/He) molecules were introduced to adsorb on the catalyst surfaces until the gaseous CO peak intensity stopped increasing (∼15 min), suggesting the saturation of CO adsorption on the catalyst surfaces. Then pure He was used to purge out the gaseous CO from the sample cell so that the chemically adsorbed/bound CO species could be detected. After collecting the background signal, the whole procedure was recorded by FTIR equipped with MCT detector (cooled by liquid nitrogen) including the CO adsorption and He purging process. For CO2 hydrogenation, the similar processes were followed, but the temperature was set to 240 °C and the ratio of H2/CO2 was set to 3. The Pd K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of the Pd2/CeO2, nano-Pd/CeO2 and Pd foil experiments were performed on the 20-BM-B beamline of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, operated at 7.0 GeV and an average current of 100 mA. The XAFS spectra were collected in fluorescence mode due to low Pd concentration. The radiation was monochromatized by a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator. Data reduction, data analysis, and EXAFS fitting were performed with the Athena and Artemis software packages. The energy calibration of the catalysts was conducted through a standard Pd foil, which as a reference was simultaneously measured."
5,Computational method,"2.4 Computational method The current work used the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [48–50] code and the projected augmented wave (PAW) [51] method to implement all the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Electron exchange and correlation was described using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [52] functional. The Hubbard U correction (Ueff =5 eV) [53–55] was added in the calculations of the CeO2 model. We select CeO2(110) and Pd(111) as catalyst models based on observed experimental results. To simulate the reaction process, a five-layer of 2 × 2 CeO2(110) slab and a four-layer 3 × 3 Pd(111) slab were employed in the calculations with the bottom two layers fixed. The interaction between two successive slabs was averted with 15 Å vacuum height. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a Monkhorst-Pack mesh [56] of 2 × 3×1 k points and 3 × 3×1 k points for Pd2/CeO2(110) and Pd(111), respectively. The energy cutoff was set as 400 eV and the force convergence criteria were 0.05 eV/Å."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Synthesis and structural characterizations of Pd2/CeO2 sample,"3.1 Synthesis and structural characterizations of Pd2/CeO2 sample The synthesized CeO2 support possesses cubic crystal structure (X-ray diffraction pattern listed in Fig. S1), and oxygen vacancies (Raman spectra listed in Fig. S2). HAADF-STEM images confirm that the fabricated CeO2 with morphology of nanorods mainly consist of (110) and (111) crystal planes (Fig. 1 a–b) and that these CeO2 nanorods were stable under the reaction conditions (Fig. S3). When Pd dimers were deposited on CeO2 nanorods (Pd2/CeO2), the HAADF-STEM images of fresh and used Pd2/CeO2 samples reveal that no Pd clusters and particles can be observed (Figs. 1a–b and S3). It indicates that Pd species are atomically dispersed on the surface of CeO2. Because of the limitation on Z-contrast between Pd atoms and CeO2 nanorods, it is difficult to directly image the atomically dispersed Pd species by HAADF-STEM [57]. Therefore, X-ray absorption spectroscopy has been utilized to explore the detailed structure information like the coordination environment of synthesized Pd2/CeO2. Fig. 1c shows the Pd K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of the Pd2/CeO2 sample compared with Pd foil and PdO as references. The absorption edge of Pd2/CeO2 sample is higher than that of Pd foil and close to that of PdO, suggesting that the Pd species carry positive charges and are coordinated with oxygen atoms. The Fourier-transformed (FT) k3-weighted EXAFS spectrum of Pd2/CeO2 sample shows three peaks (Fig. 1d) and the fitting details are listed in Table S1. The cif file used for fitting the EXAFS coordination structure is generated by DFT to simulate local structure of Pd2/CeO2, which is listed in Fig. S4. The first peak located at 2.00 Å corresponds to the Pd-O coordination path [58,59] and each Pd atom is coordinated with two O atoms (coordination number, CN = 2.1). The second peak located at 2.47 Å corresponds to the Pd-Pd coordination path of Pd2 dimer [60], which is slightly smaller than that of Pd-Pd coordination shell (2.74 Å) in the Pd foil. These results reveal that on average each Pd atom is coordinated with one Pd atom (CN = 0.5). The third peak located at 3.23 Å can be assigned to the Pd-Ce coordination path, which is slightly longer than that of Pd-O-Pd coordination shell (3.19 Å) in PdO [61]. Each Pd atom is coordinated with averagely two Ce atoms (CN = 2.0). Therefore, the Pd2O4 configuration represents the actual nearest-neighbor environment of Pd species in the Pd2/CeO2 sample. The simulated EXAFS spectrum based on our model agrees well with the experimental results that the Pd species are mainly in the form of Pd2 dimers with a unique configuration of Pd2O4 on the surface of CeO2 nanorods as shown in Fig. 1e. The DFT calculations further verify that Pd dimers can be strongly anchored to the Ce vacancy sites on CeO2 surface to form such a unique Pd2O4 configuration (Fig. 1f). The bond lengths of Pd-O, Pd-Pd and Pd-Ce in the simulated model are 2.01 Å (CN = 2), 2.55 Å (CN = 1) and 3.22 Å (CN = 2), respectively, which is in good agreement with the EXAFS results. As reference sample, the CeO2 nanorods supported Pd nanoparticles (denoted as nano-Pd/CeO2) were also prepared by precipitation method with a Pd loading of 1.9 wt%. The average size of Pd nanoparticles is estimated as 5.3 nm by CO titration method as shown in Fig. S5."
8,Catalytic performance of Pd2/CeO2 catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation,"3.2 Catalytic performance of Pd2/CeO2 catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation CO2 hydrogenation was used to explore the catalytic performance of synthesized Pd2/CeO2 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2 a, pure CeO2 does not show any detectable catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation at 240 °C and 3 MPa. Whereas, the synthesized Pd2/CeO2 catalyst enables to convert CO2 to alcohol with a CO2 conversion rate of 9.2 %, which indicates the high catalytic activity of Pd species. However, the nano-Pd/CeO2 catalyst shows lower catalytic activity with a CO2 conversion of 5.3 %, which indicates that Pd dimers are much more active than Pd particles. Moreover, the Pd2/CeO2 catalyst shows significantly enhanced selectivity (> 90 % within 5 h) compared with nano-Pd/CeO2 catalyst. The turnover frequency (TOF) of Pd2/CeO2 catalyst based on Pd atoms is 211.7 h−1 (Fig. 2b), which outperforms most of the active catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation under similar reaction conditions as shown in Table S2. Alternatively, the TOF of nano-Pd/CeO2 catalyst is 26.5 h−1, around 1/8 times of that of Pd2/CeO2, which indicates that the Pd dimers possess much higher intrinsic catalytic activity. Furthermore, the selectivity of Pd2/CeO2 catalyst to ethanol is 99.2 % while nano-Pd/CeO2 catalyst mainly forms CO (Fig. 2c), which confirms that the unique geometric structure of Pd dimers boosts the direct transformation of CO2 to ethanol. As shown in Fig. 2d, the space-time yield (STY) of Pd2/CeO2 catalyst is 45.6 gethanol gPd −1 h−1, which is around 90 times higher than that of nano-Pd/CeO2 catalyst (0.5 gmethanol gPd −1 h−1). Alternatively, the production of alcohols of Pd species on CeO2 significantly decreases with the formation of Pd clusters and particles when increasing the Pd loading."
9,Electronic structure of Pd2/CeO2 catalyst,"3.3 Electronic structure of Pd2/CeO2 catalyst To better understand the microscopic structure of the active sites of the as-synthesized Pd2/CeO2, in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy experiments using CO as a probe molecule (CO-DRIFTs) were performed on the Pd2/CeO2 and nano-Pd/CeO2 (Fig. 3 a). The ν(CO) bands above 2000 cm−1 are attributed to terminal, mono-coordinated or linearly bonded carbon monoxide, while the broad bands under 2000 cm−1 are assigned to multi-coordinated CO [62,63]. For CO adsorption on nano-Pd/CeO2 sample, a weak CO absorption band is shown at 2071 cm−1, which can be assigned to the linear CO adsorption on mononuclear Pd sites (Pd1 CO). The absorption band at 1972 cm−1 in the region of 2000−1900 cm−1 can be assigned to the bridge-bonded carbonyl on bridged Pd sites (Pd2 CO). The broad absorption band in the region of 1920−1800 cm−1 centered at 1867 cm−1 can be assigned to triply bonded carbonyl (Pd3 CO), which is a significant character of CO adsorption on Pd nanoparticles/clusters. Furthermore, the co-presence of various CO adsorption modes confirms that the Pd species in the nano-Pd/CeO2 are composed of various adsorption sites, which may cause various catalytic reaction channels for CO2 hydrogenation and lead to the low selectivity toward a specific product. For CO adsorption on Pd2/CeO2 sample, there are only two peaks at 2030 cm−1 and 1950 cm−1, which can be assigned to the linear CO adsorption on Pd sites (Pd1 CO) and bridge-bonded carbonyl (Pd2 CO) on bridged Pd sites. However, the absorption band associated with the triply bonded carbonyl (Pd3 CO) cannot be observed, which indicates the absence of a typical active site consisting of three or more Pd atoms and the high homogeneity of active sites. The high homogeneity of active sites significantly reduces the amount of catalytic channels [64] and benefits to enhance the catalytic selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. On the one hand, the CO stretching frequency on Pd sites is mainly determined by the degree of back bonding from d-orbitals of Pd. Especially for the absorption band of bridge-bonded carbonyl (Pd2 CO), the presence of neighboring Pd species will strengthen the competition for electrons in d-orbitals and correspondingly the amount of back-bonding donation will be reduced, which enables to strengthen the CO bond and increase the vibration frequency [62]. Therefore, the lower CO stretching frequency on Pd species in Pd2/CeO2 (1950 cm−1) compared with that of nano-Pd/CeO2 (1972 cm−1) further indicates that the Pd species are mainly in the form of bridged Pd sites (Pd dimers) without neighboring Pd species and CO adsorption strength on Pd dimers is stronger than that on Pd nanoparticles. Charge density difference analysis results (Fig. 3b–c) show that charge transfer between CO and Pd (111) is less significant compared with Pd2/CeO2, which corroborates the XPS data (Fig. S6) that the oxidation states of Pd species in Pd2/CeO2 are higher than that of nano-Pd/CeO2. The significant charge transfer leads to stronger binding strength of CO over Pd2/CeO2 and CO adsorption energy on Pd2/CeO2(110) (-2.91 eV) is higher than that over nano-Pd particles (−2.25 eV), which is in line with CO-DRIFTs data. DFT results in the following part indicate that CO is the key intermediate during CO2 hydrogenation over Pd2/CeO2 and CO adsorption strength on Pd active sites plays a key role in determining the product selectivity. Such strong binding strength of CO over Pd2/CeO2 would prevent CO desorption and promote the coupling between CO and CH3 intermediates to form the precursor of ethanol. As a result, the formation of ethanol on Pd dimers is promoted compared with that of Pd particles. The reaction mechanism will be discussed in the following part."
10,Reaction mechanism of Pd2/CeO2 for CO2 hydrogenation,"3.4 Reaction mechanism of Pd2/CeO2 for CO2 hydrogenation To better understand the catalytic mechanism of highly active and selective CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol over CeO2 supported Pd dimers, DFT calculations were further performed to understand the formation pathway of possible products of CO2 hydrogenation obtained in the experiments, i.e. ethanol, methanol, and CO. The reaction network integrating the formation of these three products from CO2 hydrogenation is presented in Fig. S7. The elementary steps in this network can be summarized as five types, i.e. CO2 activation, CO activation, CO bond cleavage, stepwise hydrogenation and CC coupling. Herein, we calculated the energy of the rate-determining steps, by which enormous computation for CO2 hydrogenation reaction network can be avoided. The activation energies obtained are listed in Table S3. For CO2 hydrogenation over CeO2 supported Pd dimers as shown in Figs. 4 and S7, CO2 activation proceeds through the direct dissociation of CO2 to CO with a barrier of 0.70 eV (Step 1–2 of Fig. 4), whilst the formation of formate (HCOO) and carboxyl (COOH) from CO2 needs to overcome higher activation barriers of 1.72 and 1.80 eV (Table S3), respectively, which suggests that Pd dimers easily dissociate CO bond of CO2 into CO as initial transition state. Those results indicate that the first step of CO2 activation over Pd2/CeO2 proceeds through a direct dissociation pathway to form CO rather than to form formate (HCOO) and carboxyl (COOH), which is different from the cases of Pd single atoms and particles [3,65–72]. Subsequent calculations show that the formed CO is hard to desorb with a barrier of 2.91 eV and will be further hydrogenated to CHO and COH with barriers of only 1.60 and 2.00 eV. Alternatively, the barrier of CO direct dissociation to form C is as high as 3.38 eV, which indicates that the reaction pathway will proceed following the formation of CHO (Step 3 of Fig. 4). Then reaction pathway will proceed a serial of coupling progresses to form CH3CH2OH species (Fig. 4, step 4–9) and the desorption of CH3CH2OH from Pd dimer sites is endothermic by 0.48 eV. CH4 and CH3OH are the frequent products of CO2 hydrogenation over Pd-based catalyst. However, the formation of CH4 and CH3OH mainly depends on whether CH x OH y (x = 0∼3, y = 0∼1) is dissociated or hydrogenated. Furthermore, there is also competition between the hydrogenation of CH x to produce CH4 and the coupling between CH x and CO to form precursors of ethanol. In order to figure out these issues, the possible reaction pathway of the formation of methanol has been firstly simulated. As shown in Fig. S8, the potential energy profile provides an overview to compare diverse reaction pathways to methanol over Pd2/CeO2 from the hydrogenation of CO because CO is the most favored intermediates of the initial CO2 activation on Pd2/CeO2. Consequently, methanol is generated on Pd2/CeO2 surface following the steps of CO → CHO → CH2O → CH2OH → CH3OH, by which the pathway proceeds with lowest energy as shown in red line. Nonetheless, it can be found that the dissociation of CH2OH to CH2 and OH possesses a barrier of 0.76 eV, which is much lower than that of CH2OH hydrogenation to methanol (1.41 eV), indicating that the dissociation of CH2OH is more favorable compared with the formation of methanol. Correspondingly, the CH2 species originated from the dissociation of CH2OH will proceed the pathway to form CH2CH3OH. In short, methanol formation over Pd2 dimer is not kinetically favored. The in-situ CO2 DRIFTs data also confirms the presence of key reaction intermediates on Pd dimers as shown in Fig. S9. Especially, the CO species can be clearly observed during the reaction process of CO2 hydrogenation. To further compare the formation of methane against ethanol, we have calculated the activation barriers of possible competing elementary reaction steps on Pd2/CeO2 surface listed in Table S3 and the structures of key transition states are shown in Fig. S10. One can see that, hydrogenation of CH2 shows similar possibilities with the coupling between CH2 and CO, while CH3 tends to react with CO to generate CH3CO. Subsequently, CH3CO would undergo hydrogenation to form CH3CH2OH with high selectivity. Finally, the preferred reaction mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol over CeO2 supported Pd dimers is presented in Fig. 4 along with the transition state structure of CH3 and CO coupling. Additionally, we use Pd (111) model to simulate the reaction processes over nano-Pd particles as well. In contrast to Pd2/CeO2(110), barriers for the key steps for the CH3CH2OH formation, i.e. CO2 → CO (1.07 eV) and CH3 + CO → CH3CO (1.84 eV), are much higher on Pd (111) as shown in Figs. S11 and S12. Moreover, the formed CO intermediate is much easier to desorb from Pd (111) surface as the final product compared with Pd2/CeO2 (110). This agrees well with the experimental observations that Pd2/CeO2 tends to produce ethanol with higher activity and CO is the main product on nano-Pd particle catalyst."
11,Conclusions,"In conclusion, CO2 can be efficiently converted to ethanol by constructing Pd dimers with significantly enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity (99.2 %) compared with the state-of-the-art catalysts in the open literature. The unique two-atom structure of Pd dimers possessing high homogeneity enables to directly dissociate CO2 to CO, trigger CC coupling but appropriately inhibit the further C2+ coupling, which will benefit to selectively form ethanol. Although further refinement on this Pd2/CeO2 catalyst may further boost the catalytic performance for CO2 hydrogenation and the detailed investigation on the catalytic mechanism, the strategy of fabricating atom-precision active sites by taking advantage of the unique properties of metal dimers reported here is expected to shed the light on developing highly selective catalysts for CO2/CO hydrogenation reactions."
