0,Introduction,"As a clean and sustainable energy source, hydrogen has been identified as one of the most promising alternatives to traditional fossil fuels for the mitigation of the global energy crisis and environmental pollution [1,2]. Numerous efforts have been devoted to developing technologies and devices for hydrogen production [3,4], storage [5–7], and conversion [8]. Hydrogen production from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of water electrolysis is potentially extremely valuable due to its virtues of a simple chemical process and zero greenhouse gas emissions compared to the traditional natural gas steam reforming route [9,10]. Hydrogen fuel cells can efficiently convert the chemical energy of hydrogen into electrical energy via the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), producing only water emissions [11,12]. The corresponding cathodes of these two systems are involved in oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions, respectively. It has been confirmed that the activity and stability of the corresponding ORR and OER catalysts under alkaline conditions are superior to the activity and stability under acidic conditions [13,14]. Unfortunately, even for state-of-the-art Pt-group electrocatalysts, both the HOR and HER suffer sluggish kinetics in alkaline mediums, which greatly hinders their practical applications in anion exchange membrane hydrogen fuel cells and alkaline electrolyzers [15–17]. Recent research advances suggest that the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) on the surface of catalysts can significantly impact the activity of HER/HOR. HBE has been widely used as a dominant trigger to modulate the composition and structure of electrocatalysts [15,18–20]. In addition, the high price and terrestrial scarcity of Pt-group metals has inspired the exploration of electrocatalysts with high atomic utilization to reduce catalyst costs. Optimized structures such as nanoalloys [21–23], core@shell structures [24–26], and heterostructures [27–29] have been designed to boost Pt atomic utilization and electrocatalytic performance. For instance, ultrafine Pt-M (M = Ni, Co, Fe) alloy nanowires significantly lowered the overpotential of electrocatalytic HER compared to commercial Pt/C [30]. Defect engineering technologies, such as overgrowth [31,32], doping [23,33] and plasma-assisted synthesis [34–36], have been widely used to regulate the defect structure of electrocatalysts, boosting their activity for fuel cells and metal-air cells. For example, surface defects stemming from twinned nanocrystals, ultrathin nanosheets, and nanowires can also further reduce electrochemical reaction barriers and boost the reaction kinetics [31,32]. However, these defect structures are elusive and precisely tailoring them is difficult. To address this issue, epitaxial overgrowth has been successfully implemented to replicate the defect structure of substrates or seeds to create heterostructures with controllable defect structures [24,37–39]. For example, Rh@Pt core–shell nanowires that replicated abundant surface defects from twinned Rh nanowire seeds showed an effectively enhanced ethanol oxidation electrocatalytic activity [39]. In addition, Au-Ru hybrid nanowires prepared by growing Ru nanorods along the twin boundaries of Au nanowires exhibited excellent HER performance in an alkaline medium [40]. Nevertheless, the preparation of well-defined Pt-based defect structures for investigating the bifunctional structure–property relationship toward both HER and HOR is still rare and remains extremely challenging. Herein, we report a seed-mediated fabrication of penta-twinned (PTw) Rh@Pt core–shell nanobranches (NBs) with defective surfaces and a tunable Pt-shell thickness toward bifunctional electrocatalysis for efficient alkaline HER and HOR. With the assistance of a micro-syringe pump to control the addition of Pt precursor solution during the synthesis, the twinned defects of the inner PTw Rh NBs can be replicated on the outer Pt surface. Moreover, the thickness of the Pt-shells can be precisely controlled from 1.0, 2.0, and 3.8 to 5.0 atomic layers, referring to Rh@Pt0.21 NBs, Rh@Pt0.44 NBs, Rh@Pt0.83 NBs and Rh@Pt1.16 NBs (Rh@Ptx NBs, X is referred to value of Pt/Rh atomic ratios), respectively. The HER measurements in 1.0 M KOH show a volcano-like relationship for the electrocatalytic activity with Pt-shell thickening. Notably, the Rh@Pt0.83 NBs display the highest performance in terms of both specific and mass activities, exhibiting specific and mass activities 10.4 and 6.1 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. In addition, the Rh@Pt0.83 NBs also show a superior exchange current density, approximately 7 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C, in the evaluation of HOR performance. After systematic characterization, we suggest that the outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of Rh@Pt0.83 NBs can be attributed to their abundant active defect sites derived from a highly defective surface, compressive strain and the ligand effect."
1,Results and discussion,"First, PTw Rh NBs were synthesized based on a previously reported protocol [41] to serve as the seeds (Fig. S1). Due to epitaxial growth from the vertex of nascent icosahedral nuclei along the direction of 〈110〉, PTw Rh NBs present an ultra-fine dendritic structure with a high percentage of open {100} facets and significant lattice strain. The average diameter of the PTw Rh NBs is 5.1 nm. A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image (Fig. S1c) clearly displays the lattice defect structure of PTw Rh NBs, confirming the penta-twinned nanorod feature, as shown by the related model (Fig. S1d). The PTw Rh@Ptx core–shell NBs were subsequently synthesized through a seed-mediated growth method, as shown by the schematic illustration (Fig. 1 a). Specifically, PTw Rh NBs were dispersed in ethylene glycol (EG) to obtain a Rh NBs suspension, then a desired volume of Pt precursor solution (2.2 mg mL−1) was slowly introduced into the reaction solution by a micro-syringe pump. During the synthesis, EG was used as both a solvent and a weak reducing agent to slow down the reaction rate. Under sluggish kinetics, the self-nucleation of Pt can be avoided and the thickness of the overgrown Pt-shell can be effectively regulated at the atomic level by simply adjusting the injected volume of the Pt precursor solution. Finally, a series of Rh@Ptx NBs with well-defined Pt-shell thickness were obtained. As a representative sample, the composition and structure of the as-synthesized Rh@Pt0.83 NBs were comprehensively characterized (Fig. 1b–g). The Rh@Pt0.83 NBs are composed of multiple uniform branches with no other morphologies visible in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image (Fig. 1b). This nanobranch morphology can prevent stacking and aggregation, helping enhance electrocatalytic activity. The jagged edges of the nanobranches (highlighted in the yellow dashed rectangle) in Fig. 1c reveal that there are abundant defect sites on the surface of the Rh@Pt0.83 NBs. The high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HADDF-STEM) image of Rh@Pt0.83 NB shown in Fig. 1d further confirms the defective surface. The smooth boundary between shell and core shows that the Pt-shells conformally overgrew on a PTw Rh NB seed in a layer-by-layer mode. The interplanar spacing between lattice planes of the shell was measured to be 0.196 nm, indicating that the exposed surface of Rh@Pt0.83 NBs is the Pt(100) facet. According to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping and the corresponding line scan images in Fig. 1e–f, Rh and Pt are located in the core and the shell, respectively. These results further demonstrate the core@shell structure of Rh@Pt0.83 NBs. Based on scanning electron microscope-EDS (SEM-EDS) measurements, the atomic ratio of Rh/Pt in the Rh@Pt0.83 NBs was measured to be 59.7:40.3 (Fig. 1g), close to the 54.7:45.3 ratio determined by high sensitive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HS-ICP-MS). To reveal the structure–property relationship of strain defects, Rh@Ptx NBs with different shell thicknesses were characterized. All Rh@Ptx NBs show a uniform dendritic architecture in Fig. S2. The thickness of the Pt-shells were calculated by the equation of NPt = (DRh@Pt – DRh)/2dPt(100), where Npt is the atomic layer of Pt, DRh@Pt and DRh is the diameter of PTw Rh NBs and PTw Rh@Pt NBs, respectively, and dPt(100) is the lattice spacing of Pt(100). According to the diameter of Rh@Ptx NBs measured in Fig. S2e–h and Table S1, the thickness of the Pt-shells was calculated to be 1.0, 2.0, 3.8, and 5.0 atomic layers, corresponding to diameters of 5.5, 5.9, 6.6 and 7.1 nm, respectively. The EDS element mapping and line scan images of Rh@Ptx NBs in Fig. S3–S5 and Fig. 2 a–f demonstrate that the synthesized products present a uniform core@shell structure. The broadening half-peak widths of Pt compared with Rh in Fig. 2d–f further confirm that the Pt-shell is thickening. In addition, the atomic percentages of Rh@Ptx NBs were also measured by HS-ICP-MS. The products are subsequently denoted as Rh@Pt0.21 NBs, Rh@Pt0.44 NBs, Rh@Pt0.83 NBs and Rh@Pt1.16 NBs, referring to the atomic percentage of Pt/Rh, as shown in Fig. 2g. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to investigate the crystal structure and strain of Rh@Ptx NBs. As shown in Fig. S6, all Rh@Ptx NBs present a face-centered cubic (fcc) phase and the broad diffraction peaks indicate their ultrathin nanobranch structure. The relatively narrow half-peak width of the (220) diffraction peak can be explained by the growth direction of the nanobranches along the 〈110〉 direction [41]. Furthermore, based on the lattice parameter of the (111) plane calculated by the Bragg equation (2dsinθ = nλ), the specific strain of Rh@Ptx NBs can be obtained by equation (1), where s(Pt) is relative to the strain of Rh@Ptx NBs and a shell and a Pt are the lattice parameters of the Pt-shell and pure Pt, respectively [42]. As shown in Table S2 and Fig. 2h–i, all Rh@Ptx NBs display a high compressive strain compared to pure Pt, and the strength of the strain gradually reduces as the Pt-shell thickness increases. It is notable that the strain is approximately − 2.3% if the Pt-shell is less than 4.0 atomic layers, but declines significantly to − 1.4% for the Pt-shell with 5.0 atomic layers. This illustrates that the strain of the twinned seeds is successfully replicated in the Pt-shells of these materials and that precisely controlling the Pt-shell thickness to fewer than 5.0 atomic layers could result in a high level of strain. Therefore, these Rh@Ptx NBs offer a facile strategy to precisely regulate surface strain by adjusting the overgrowth atomic layers on twinned seeds. (1) s ( P t ) = a s h e l l - a P t a P t × 100 High sensitive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HS-XPS) was used to investigate the composition and structure of Rh@Ptx NBs. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table S3, HS-XPS analysis demonstrates that the binding energy (BE) of Pt 4f7/2 for Pt in the Rh@Ptx NBs positively shifts by about 0.11 eV compared with standard Pt [43]. It has been reported that upshifting the BE of Pt leads to a decline in its d-band center and results in weakened HBE, which can effectively promote HER performance in an alkaline medium [44–46]. Moreover, as depicted in Fig. S7, each XPS spectra assigned to Rh 3d and Pt 4d can be divided into six peaks and identified as Rh0/Rh3+ and Pt0/Pt2+, respectively. Interestingly, the BE of Rh 3d5/2 also upshifts slightly, indicating that there is electronic interaction between the Pt-shell and Rh core due to the ligand effect. As reported, the ligand effect has been an effective strategy to modify the electronic structure of electrocatalysts and enhance electrocatalytic performance [24,39]. Therefore, the ligand effect between Rh and Pt may enhance the electrocatalytic activity of Rh@Ptx NBs. The HS-XPS results also show that the Pt atomic percentage gradually increases, in line with the results from HS-ICP-MS and SEM-EDS measurements. Impressively, all the atomic percentages of Pt2+/Pt0 in the Rh@Ptx NBs in Table S3 are higher than 50%, gradually decreasing from 82% to 55% with increasing Pt-shell thickness. It has been shown that a high density of structural defects can provide more potential channels for oxygen incorporation and result in a high proportion of oxidized species [39,47,48]. Therefore, these HS-XPS data illustrate that a high density of surface defects are present on the surface of the as-synthesized Rh@Ptx NBs and potentially contribute to the unique ultra-thin PTw Pt-shell structure and high compressive strain. The electrochemical properties of Rh@Ptx NBs toward HER/HOR were carried out in an alkaline medium with commercial Pt/C as the reference catalyst. To reveal the contribution of the surface defects of Rh@Ptx NBs, monodispersed Pt nanocubes (NCs) enclosed by {100} facets were also synthesized (Fig. S8). Cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements were used to characterize the electrochemical structure of Rh@Ptx NBs in an N2-saturated 1 M KOH solution with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, shown in Fig. S9. Three couples of symmetrical underpotential deposition (UPD) peaks, namely, hydrogen adsorption (UPD-Hads) and desorption (UPD-Hdes), observed between 0.05 and 0.4 V are assigned to Rh(100) [49], Pt(110) and Pt(100), respectively [50]. With increasing thickness of the Pt-shell, the relative intensity of the UPD-Hdes peak at approximately 0.18 V declines and the relative intensity of the UPD-Hdes peak at approximately 0.26 V increases. This indicates that the surface of the PTw Rh seed is gradually covered by Pt atoms until a compact Pt-shell is formed during the overgrowth stage. Interestingly, the UPD-Hdes potential of Pt(100) of Rh@Pt0.83 NBs is slightly lower than that of the Pt NCs and commercial Pt/C, which is potentially due to the increased presence of surface defects and weakened HBE. Subtracting the double layer in the CV curve by the hydrogen adsorption area (Fig. S9), the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) can be measured. The ECSA of Rh@Pt0.21 NBs, Rh@Pt0.44 NBs, Rh@Pt0.83 NBs, Rh@Pt1.16 NBs, Pt NCs, and commercial Pt/C was measured to be 41.43, 40.80, 36.11, 30.28, 47.49, and 62.30 m2 g−1, respectively. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S10 and Table S4, CO stripping tests were also conducted in an N2-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution. The Rh@Ptx NBs, demonstrate similar ECSA calculated by CO stripping, i.e., around 30 m2 g−1, with the exception of Rh@Pt1.16 NBs. In terms of CO oxidation potential, the Rh@Ptx NBs show an almost 100 mV forward potential compared with that of commercial Pt/C. HER measurements were conducted by three-electrode linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in an H2-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) system, as displayed in Fig. 4 and Fig. S11. According to the polarization curves normalized by the geometric area of the disk or ECSA in Fig. 4a–b, the HER activity of Rh@Ptx NBs shows a volcano-like tendency. In particular, Rh@Pt0.83 NBs display the lowest overpotential. Specifically, at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential of Rh@Pt0.21 NBs, Rh@Pt0.44 NBs, Rh@Pt0.83 NBs, Rh@Pt1.16 NBs, and commercial Pt/C were measured to be 76, 54, 44, 55, and 98 mV, respectively (Fig. S12). To further demonstrate the reaction kinetics, the HER Tafel slopes of Rh@Ptx NBs were calculated and plotted in Fig. 4c and Fig. S12. The Tafel slope values of Rh@Pt0.21 NBs, Rh@Pt0.44 NBs, Rh@Pt0.83 NBs and Rh@Pt1.16 NBs are 87.3, 84.8, 54.2, and 92.5 mV dec−1, respectively, all of which are more gentle than that of commercial Pt/C (112.9 mV dec−1). It is notable that the value of the Tafel slope of Rh@Pt0.83 NBs is one-half to one-third of the Tafel slope values of the other Rh@Ptx NBs products and the commercial Pt/C, an indication of outstanding HER activity. Moreover, the mass activity and specific activity (MA and SA) of Rh@Ptx NBs were also calculated at a current density of − 0.07 V vs. RHE in Fig. 4d. All Rh@Ptx NBs samples show superior electrocatalytic activity compared with Rh NBs and commercial Pt/C (Fig. S13). In particular, Rh@Pt0.83 NBs show the best performance with an MA of 2.36 A mgPt −1 and SA of 6.55 mA cm−2, 6.05 and 10.40 times higher than the MA (0.39 A mgPt −1) and SA (0.63 mA cm−2) of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Even normalized to the total mass of Pt and Rh, the mass activities of these Rh@Ptx NBs are still much better than that of commercial Pt/C (Fig. S14). And comparison with other Pt-based electrocatalysts reported in recent years in Table S5, Rh@Pt0.83 NBs still demonstrate outstanding HER performance. The electrocatalytic stability of Rh@Pt0.83 NBs was investigated by chronoamperometry measurements in a 1.0 M KOH solution at an overpotential of − 0.07 V vs RHE for 10 h. As shown in Fig. S15, the degradation of current density of Rh@Pt0.83 NBs is much slower than that for commercial Pt/C, demonstrating its excellent electrocatalytic stability. In addition, CV sweeps between − 0.2 and 0.05 V were performed to further illustrate the durability of the Rh@Pt0.83 NBs in 1 M KOH solution. As depicted in Fig. 4e–f, the MA of Rh@Pt0.83 NBs can still reach 5.59 A mgPt −1 or 3.99 A mgPt −1 at an overpotential of − 0.07 V after 1000 or 5000 CV cycles, respectively. In contrast, the MA for commercial Pt/C after 1000 and 5000 CV cycles is only 0.52 A mgPt −1 and 0.42 A mgPt −1, an order of magnitude lower. The HOR activities of Rh@Pt0.83 NBs, Pt NCs, and commercial Pt/C were also assessed by using RDE measurements. Fig. 5 a shows the polarization curves of Rh@Pt0.83 NBs, Pt NCs, and commercial Pt/C in 1.0 M KOH with saturated H2 at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm. The current density of Rh@Pt0.83 NBs increases more quickly than the current density for both commercial Pt/C and Pt NCs, demonstrating the excellent HOR activity of Rh@Pt0.83 NBs catalysts. Revealing the HOR activity of Rh@Pt0.83 NBs, the MA, SA and exchange current density (ECD) normalized by the electrochemical surface were calculated as shown in Fig. 5b–d. Rh@Pt0.83 NBs display an MA of 0.214 A mgpt −1 and an SA of 0.592 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 10 mV, which are 3.3 and 5.6 times higher than the MA and SA of commercial Pt/C, respectively. In terms of ECD, the Rh@Pt0.83 NBs are superior to commercial Pt/C by a factor of about 7 (1.97 and 0.28 mA cm−2 for Rh@Pt0.83 NBs and commercial Pt/C, respectively). HOR LSV curves with different rotation speeds for Rh@Pt0.83 NBs and commercial Pt/C in 1 M KOH are exhibited in Fig. S16. The diffusion current density increases with increasing rotation speed. These results show that Rh@Pt0.83 NBs have excellent HER and HOR activity which is potentially caused by the integration of surface twinned defects, compressive strain, and the ligand effect."
2,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we demonstrate a facile method for the synthesis of highly defective PTw Rh@Ptx core–shell NBs with engineered Pt-shell thickness by a seed-mediated method. Through precise shell thickness engineering, the as-synthesized ultrathin Pt-shells are able to replicate the twin defects of PTw Rh seeds and display a compressive strain from 1.4% to 2.3%. Significantly, these Rh@Ptx NBs demonstrate excellent electrocatalytic performance for HER/HOR in an alkaline medium compared with commercial Pt/C and Pt NCs. In particular, Rh@Pt0.83 NBs with a Pt-shell of 3.8 atomic layers display the most significantly enhanced HER activities, with a mass activity of 2.36 A mgPt −1 and a specific activity of 6.55 mA cm−2 at − 0.07 V, as well as the lowest overpotential of the tested materials (44 mV at 10 mA cm−2). In addition, Rh@Pt0.83 NBs also show a superior performance for HOR in an alkaline medium, with a mass activity of 0.214 A mgPt −1, specific activity of 0.592 mA cm−2, and exchange current density of 1.97 mA cm−2. The structure–property relationship between Rh@Pt0.83 NBs and HER/HOR clearly demonstrates the importance of surface engineering and strain regulation. Overall, our work provides a facile method for precise regulation of twinned and strained nanostructures to develop high-performance bifunctional hydrogen redox electrocatalysts, which can be further developed to explore applications for critical electrocatalytic reactions such as oxygen reduction or ethanol oxidation."

After that, the cleaned electrocatalysts were centrifugated and washed with ethanol for three times, and dried in an oven under vacuum condition at 60 °C for 9 h. To prepare the homogeneous electrocatalyst ink, 2 mg of the as-synthesized catalysts (8 mg for Pt/C) was ultrasonically dispersed in a solvent containing 2.0 mL of ethanol and 10 μL of Nafion (Venthol:VNafion = 1:0.005) for 20 min. The glassy-carbon electrode (GCE, diameter: 5 mm, area: 0.196 cm2) used as working electrode was first polished and dropped with 3 μL of the electrocatalyst ink, then dried in room temperature naturally. The electrochemical active surface area was calculated by integrating the Hupd desorption domain on the cyclic voltammograms, which was recorded in N2-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution at room temperature with a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1 between 0 and 1.2 V (vs. RHE). In a typical HER/HOR experiment, a carbon rod, a Hg/HgO (1 M NaOH) electrode and an electrocatalyst ink casted rotating disk electrode were served as counter electrode, reference electrode and working electrode, respectively. Before electrocatalytic experiments, the electrolyte (1.0 M KOH) was first bubbled by N2 gas for 10 min to remove O2 from the solution, then H2 gas was purged into the solution for another 15 min to ensure the solution is saturated with H2. Subsequently, linear sweep voltammetry method was used to test catalytic performance of the catalysts with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 (at 298 K). The rotation rate of rotation disk electrode was controlled at 1,600 rpm. to prevent the H2 bubble gathering on the surface of the working electrode, and the iR drop of all the polarization curves was compensated at 90%. CO stripping was conducted by holding the electrode potential at 0.1 V (vs RHE) for 10 min in a CO-saturated solution to ensure a full mono-layer of adsorbed CO on the catalysts surface and then transferred the electrode to a N2-staurated electrolyte, followed by cycling with a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1 between 0.05 and 1.2 V (vs RHE).
