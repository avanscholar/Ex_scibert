0,Introduction,"1-Butanol is a crucial bulk chemical with a wide range of industrial uses and that is receiving more and more attention from the society, industry and academy. 1-Butanol is a commodity chemical used as a solvent and for the production of various esters and ethers, some of which are important monomers for the polymer industry. Longer chain fatty alcohols like hexanol and octanol are popularly used as surfactants to stabilize lower alcohol/diesel blends and diesel–oil micro-emulsions [1]. Development of sustainable alternative energy sources and environmental protection became very important issues during last two decades. Now there are many practical applications and approaches being evaluated, such as wind power, solar energy and especially biomass and its derivatives utilization [2–8]. 1-Butanol can be used as a fuel, having some advantages over ethanol such as a higher energy density (29.2 MJ∙L−1vs. 19.6 MJ L−1), lower corrosiveness, and being more suitable for distribution through existing pipelines [9]. Currently, fuel blends rather than neat biofuels are commonly used for internal combustion engine applications, for instance, 5–20% biodiesel (B5-B20) in compression ignition engines, and 10, 20 and 85% ethanol (E10, E20, and E85) in spark ignition engines to partially replace diesel and gasoline fuels [10]. 1-Butanol is considered not only as a substitute for gasoline, but also as blends with diesel and some popular types of nonedible biodiesel for partial or complete replacement of conventional diesel from compression ignition engines with no modifications of engine hardware [11–14]. A number of research show that 1-butanol application instead of diesel potentially leads to the reduction of emissions, mainly soot while achieving diesel-like engine efficiencies, since it has more oxygen content compared with biodiesel [1,10,15]. Although the fermentation ABE process in which mixtures of acetone, 1-butanol, and ethanol are produced by the use of strains of the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum has been possible since the 1919 [16] the main problem is still quite low production of biobutanol. Ethanol fermentation process has a 10–30 times higher production rate than 1-butanol and isomers fermentation [17]. In the petrochemical industry 1-butanol is generally produced by using the oxo-synthesis, also known as hydroformylation, (Scheme 1 ), which consists of propylene hydroformylation followed by butyraldehyde hydrogenation to yield 1-butanol. The oxo synthesis uses harmful carbon monoxide as a raw material at high pressure of approximately 30 MPa in addition to propylene and is a complicated process, resulting in high cost and low profitability. Also requires two different catalysts (cobalt or rhodium in the first step and nickel in the second step). Furthermore, because it is based on a homogeneous catalyst, the process suffers from drawbacks such as difficult separation of the desired compound, costly catalyst preparation, and environmental issues that can be attributed to the limited lifetime of the transition-metal complexes used [18]. One more approach aimed to 1-butanol production is Guerbet synthesis. The traditional (partly-homogeneous) synthesis of Guerbet alcohols is known to proceed via several consecutive steps [19,20] (Scheme 2 ). It is clear that a purely heterogeneous process would present many advantages over the hybrid homogeneous-heterogeneous system aforementioned. The conversion of ethanol into 1-butanol over purely heterogeneous catalysts has been reported in several publications and patents [21–31]. Generally the reaction temperatures vary from 200 °C up to 450 °C, with a relatively low conversion (10–20%) and selectivity approaching 70%. Hydroxyapatites were shown to be the most active and selective to higher alcohols [22,23], but suffer from deactivation by high molecular weight by-products that form during the reaction. Metal oxide based catalysts deactivates slower, but suffer from low selectivity [32]. The highest selectivity to 1-butanol ever reported is 76.3% at 14.7% conversion of ethanol [24] and 81.2% at 7.6% conversion of ethanol [23]. These described technologies suggest a two-phase process where ethanol vapour is passed through a solid catalyst loaded in a fixed bed. The study of a liquid-phase process for ethanol to 1-butanol conversion over γ-alumina supported catalysts modified with a large number of metals showed 20% Ni/Al2O3 (manufactured by Crossfield) possess the highest selectivity equal to 62% at 5% conversion of ethanol [33]. Cu-containing catalysts may be prospective systems for ethanol self-condensation into 1-butanol since Cu is a well-known active component for acetic aldehyde synthesis from ethanol and its condensation leads to crotonaldehyde formation in the presence of acidic catalyst (alumina for example). Support plays a very important role in the formation of aim- and by-products in the reaction of ethanol self-condensation [34]. Cu-CeO2/AC catalyst exhibited ethanol conversion 46.2% with moderate selectivity to 1-butanol 41.3% [35] Study of ZrO2-supported Cu catalysts with different Cu content (5–30 wt%) report that among this the highest selectivity provided sample with Cu content ≥10% [36]. It is important to note that the presence of water in the initial feed has a negative effect on the course of the reaction [32,37]. Even a minimal amount (4%) of water leads to a dramatic decrease of the selectivity and deactivation of the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst [33]. Authors explain this by the fact that in the presence of water the Lewis strong basic sites O2− transform into weaker Brønsted OH−sites [26]. In Ref. [38] report that in the ethanol conversion over ZnO water plays two important roles on the: 1) water blocks the strong Lewis acid sites for ethanol dehydration reactions while leaving the weak Lewis acid–base pairs for ethanol dehydrogenation; 2) water promotes the secondary acetaldehyde oxidation to acetic acid conversion and inhibits the acetaldehyde aldol-condensation to crotonaldehyde. Recently, we found that supercritical ethanol conversion over Au-M/Al2O3 (M – Cu or Ni) catalysts allow to reach 77.6% selectivity of 1-butanol formation [39,40]. Since gold is an expensive component, it is promising to develop cheaper and stable Cu/Al2O3 catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts synthesis,"2.1 Catalysts synthesis Gamma alumina (Catalyst LLC, S = 190 m2/g) was used as a support for the catalysts; Cu(CH3COO)2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 98% pure) were used as metal precursors. Cu/Al2O3 catalysts with 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 wt.% of Cu were prepared by impregnation from methanol solution. Then the samples were dried for 5 h at 80 °C in a vacuum dryer, after this the samples were calcined in a muffle furnace for 5 h at 500 °C under an argon atmosphere."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The metal content of the catalysts was determined by atomic absorption on a Thermo iCE 3000 AA spectrometer. The relative error of this method was within ±1%. X-ray photoelectron spectra were obtained on an Axis Ultra DLD (Kratos) instrument using AlKα radiation (1486.6 eV) mono with neutralizer. The spectra were registered in the regime of constant relative resolution in energy. The spectra were recorded with an energy of transmission of the analyzer of 10–40 eV in steps of 0.02–0.05 eV. The measurements were carried out at a pressure in the analysis chamber of ∼5*10−8 Pa. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of catalysts were carried out on a JEOL JEM 2100F/UHR microscope with 0.1-nm resolution and a JED-2300 X-ray spectrometer, respectively. Specimens were prepared via ultrasonic dispersion of the catalysts (0.2 g) in ethanol (10 mL) followed by the deposition of a drop of suspension on a Cu grid coated with carbon."
4,Catalyst screening,"2.3 Catalyst screening Analytical grade ethanol (96%) was used without further purification. Catalytic experiments were carried out in a 45 mL high pressure Parr autoclave equipped with magnetic stirring. The reactor was loaded with the catalyst (typically 4.5 g). The catalyst testing procedure was as follows: the reactor with catalyst was loaded with ethanol, closed and flushed with inert gas (Ar). The reactor was heated with a heating rate of 20 °C/min. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 3 h. After reaction, the reactor was cooled down in atmosphere."
5,Analytical procedure,"2.4 Analytical procedure Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the C1–C5 hydrocarbon gases were performed by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) with a Kristall-4000 M chromatograph (detector: FID, carrier gas: He, column: HP-PLOT/Al2O3, 50 m × 0.32 mm). GLC analyses of CO, CO2 and H2 were performed with a Kristall-4000 chromatograph (detector: TCD, carrier gas: Ar, column: SKT, 1.5 m × 4 mm). The qualitative composition of the liquid products were identified by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using a MSD 6973 - and an Autowt.-150 spectrometer - (EI = 70 eV, catalyst volume = 1 μl, columns: HP-5MS, 50 m × 0.32 mm and CPSil-5, 25 m × 0.15 mm). The quantitative content of the organic compounds was determined by GLC using a Varian 3600 chromatograph (detector: FID, carrier gas: He, column: Chromtec SE-30, 25 m × 0.25 mm). The ethanol content in the aqueous phase was determined by GC-MS using the absolute calibration method on the ratio of alcohol to water integral signals. Calibration of the GC was carried out with commercial standards using method [33]."
6,Results and discussion,"The effect of the reaction temperature on selectivity of ethanol conversion into linear α-alcohols was investigated over 2%Cu/Al2O3. The maximum selectivity of α-alcohols 94.4% was obtained at 275 °C (Table 1 ). Ethanol conversion increases with increasing the reaction temperature from 245 to 295 °C. In the same time the selectivity of 1-butanol formation has maximum 81.9% at 275 °C. At lower temperature (245 °C) main by-products are acetaldehyde and 2-butene-1-ol that selectivity is 55 and 12%, respectively. These products are not exactly by-products, according to Scheme 2 both acetaldehyde and 2-butene-1-ol are the process intermediates. The high selectivity of the formation of acetaldehyde indicates a low rate of its condensation reaction and a fast dehydrogenation of initial ethanol. At the same time, the hydrogenation of the intermediate 2-butene-1-ol is difficult, as indicated by its significant amount in the reaction products. Analysis of gaseous products showed that they consist of 99% of hydrogen and a small amount of ethylene and butylenes. At higher temperature (295 °C) the main liquid by-products were ethers. Selectivity of its formation was the next: diethyl ether–25%, ethyl butyl ether–23%, ethyl hexyl ether–3%. Also several amount of esters were detected that total selectivity was approximately 7%. In gaseous products, hydrogen content decreased to 85% and aliphatic hydrocarbons C2-C4 content increased. Small amounts of methane and carbon dioxide have also been identified. Should be noticed that gaseous products yield even at 295 °C did not exceed 1 wt.%. The obtained data demonstrate a high dependence of ethanol self-condensation selectivity on temperature. It is known that aldol condensation is catalyzed by acids. In our case, aluminum oxide provides the reaction system with the necessary acidic sites, which at 275 °C efficiently catalyze aldol condensation, and when the temperature is raised to 295 °C, the rate of intermolecular dehydration of alcohol is dramatically increased. The comparison of supercritical and gaseous ethanol self-condensation shows the benefits of supercritical regime. The critical point of ethanol is 241 °C and 61 atm [41]. Under subcritical pressure 50 atm and at the optimum temperature of 275 °C gaseous ethanol conversion rate decreases by 4% and 1-butanol selectivity decreases approximately by half. The reason of observed conversion and selectivity increasing under supercritical conditions may be caused by several factors: the decrease of hydrogen bonds quantity of ethanol, diffusion barrier lowering and O-H bonds of ethanol acidity increase [42,43]. To evaluate the difference between gaseous and supercritical ethanol we carried out a series of kinetic experiments. Kinetic measurements were carried out in the range of 900–5400 s, at that the conversion of the initial ethanol did not exceed 20%, and the selectivity of 1-butanol formation exceeded 90%. The determination of the amount of 1-butanol in the reaction mixture with a sufficient degree of reliability in the time interval 0–900 s was not possible due to the hardware limitations of the experimental unit. Found that the rate of formation of 1-butanol for supercritical (Fig. 1 a) and gaseous (Fig. 1b) ethanol is satisfactorily described by the first-order equation (dCBuOH/dτ = k·CBuOH). A graph was plotted in a linear form between lnCBuOH v/s τ to determine the rate constant (Fig. 1). As rate constant depends on temperature, reaction kinetics was studied at 255–285 °C temperature. Fig. 2 is a plot of linear form of Arrhenius equation ln ( k ) = ln ( A ) − E a R × 1 T to determine the activation energy and pre-exponential factor. The activation energy and pre-exponential factor were found to be 25.8 kJ/mol and 15.3·10−3 sec−1 for gaseous ethanol and 83.9 kJ/mol and 18·103 sec−1 for supercritical ethanol. The obtained result shows that, according to the values of the activation energy, the supercritical regime reduces the diffusion barrier and ensures the reaction proceeds in the kinetic region. According to the values of the pre-exponential factor, the number of collisions of substrate molecules with catalytically active sites in a unit of the reaction volume increases by six orders, that leads to the reaction intensification in the supercritical regime. Based on obtained kinetic data an acceptable mechanism of the reaction may be proposed (Scheme 3 ): The Eley-Rideal mechanism is also proposed by other authors [39,40]. Moreover this type of mechanism is in the good agreement of the experimental and calculated data [40]. Literature analysis does not permit to evaluate the real limiting step. The most probable limiting steps at our conditions are the ethanol chemisorptions on the surface or hydrogen transfer and desorption of 2-buten-1-ol (step 5, Scheme 3). To appreciate the effect of copper content in Cu/Al2O3 catalysts on the process selectivity a number of Cu-containing catalysts with different copper loading was tested (Table 2 ). We have previously shown that a Cu/Al2O3 catalyst containing 0.06 wt.% of copper does not exhibit catalytic activity in ethanol self-condensation reaction [41–43]. However, over a catalyst containing 0.5 wt.% of copper, the ethanol conversion is 25% with a selectivity of 1-butanol formation of 78.8%. With an increase of Cu content, the ethanol conversion increases too, however, after the Cu content exceeds the 5%, the conversion decreases. The selectivity of α-alcohols practically doesn't depend on copper content between 0.5 and 5 wt.%, but when Cu content was 10 wt.%, the selectivity decreases by 10%. The selectivity dependence on copper content probably shows that reaction is structurally sensitive, i.e. proceeds on active sits of a certain size. For further experiments we used a 5% copper catalyst to study the effect of water addition, because with use of this catalyst we reached the highest ratio of ethanol conversion. A series of experiments of the water content in the feeding ethanol effect on process parameters was done due to two reasons. The first is to exclude separation of water with ethanol. Ethanol is currently produced mainly by fermentation of plant raw materials and in the composition of fermentation mixtures, its content does not exceed 11–19 wt%. Ethanol separation is an energy-consuming process. The second - during the self-condensation reaction of ethanol, water accumulates in the system, that can effect on the reaction parameters. The experiments shows, that increasing of water content in the initial alcohol leads to ethanol conversion decrease (Table 3 ). The maximum conversion of ethanol was obtained during absolute alcohol using. Nevertheless the water content practically does not affect the selectivity of 1-butanol, while the selectivity of 1-hexanol and 1-octanol decreases. Table 4 shows the products composition of self-condensation reaction of pure ethanol and ethanol containing 20 vol.% of water. Water presence in feeding ethanol leads to intensification of acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate formation. This fact shows that the dehydrogenation step proceeds actively, but the next step of aldol condensation slows down (Scheme 2). Probably, aldol condensation occurs on the acid sites of the surface of alumina. Taking into account that the catalyst was calcined before the experiment in air at 400 °C, its surface should contain mainly Lewis acidic sites and a small number of Bronsted acidic sites. The interaction of Lewis acidic sites with water during the reaction leads to its transformation into Bronsted sites, that changes the acidity of the catalyst and results in inhibition of aldol condensation. As a result, the acetaldehyde accumulates in reaction volume that leads to blocking the active site of copper that leads to the decrease of ethanol conversion and a significant deceleration of the self-condensation reaction. In products of absolute ethanol conversion the content of butenes and diethyl ether increases. An increase of the content of dehydration products also indirectly indicates the importance and influence of the catalyst acidity on the selectivity of ethanol self-condensation. In addition, it can be proposed that the chemisorption of ethanol and water at active sites occurs due to the coordination of the oxygen atom, then the potential energy of the surface complexes of water molecules is much lower than that of ethanol complexes, that leads to the blocking of catalytically active sites by water molecules. Thus, a dramatic decrease of ethanol conversion in the presence of water in the feedstock may be caused by influence of the following factors: strong chemisorption of water on active catalytic centers, changing the acid properties of the surface, or a combination of these factors. In order to study the stability of the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, a series of consecutive 5-h experiments was carried out, with a total time on stream of 100 h. The results are shown in Fig. 3 . The ethanol conversion monotonously decreases, and the selectivity of the formation of 1-butanol slightly increases after 60 h of catalyst being on stream. Decrease in ethanol conversion can probably be explained by the accumulation on the catalyst surface of chemisorbed hydroxyl groups inhibiting the aldol condensation step as was mentioned above. The increase in selectivity can be explained by the change in the valence state of copper. Copper acetate (II) is used to synthesize the catalyst, and the most selective reaction occurs over metal state copper or copper (I). During the reaction, hydrogen is formed (Scheme 2), and it can reduce copper (II) and thereby change the selectivity of the reaction. In order to confirm this assumption, an experiment was carried out with a reduced Cu/Al2O3 catalyst. The reduction was carried out for 12 h at a temperature of 450 °C and a hydrogen pressure of 100 atm. According to X-ray diffraction data, the catalyst contained a phase of only metallic copper. Catalytic test showed that in the presence of a reduced Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, ethanol with a conversion ratio of 29.6% was converted to 1-butanol with a selectivity of 80.4%. So the charge state of copper has practically no effect on the parameters of the reaction. To determine the reasons for the decrease in the conversion of ethanol observed during the long experiment, additional structural studies were carried out."
7,XPS study,"3.1 XPS study Spectra of high resolution shake-up satellites in Cu2p spectra specific for copper (II) presented in Fig. 4 . It can be used to estimate the proportion of copper (II) on the surface of the samples. The ratio of the area of the main line of Cu2p3/2-electrons to the area of the satellite in copper oxide CuO is about 1.9. Using this ratio, the proportion of copper (II) on the surface of the samples was calculated. It was 56% for the initial sample, 44% for the sample after 25 h, and 38% for the sample, after 100 h on stream. The contribution of copper (II) to the experimental spectrum is shown in Fig. 4 with the blue line. The contribution of other states is indicated by a red line. This contribution can include both copper(I) and the metallic state of copper. A reliable separation of these states is impossible, since their binding energies differ little and the peaks of these states overlap greatly and with peaks of copper (II). Auger spectra are used to determine copper in different oxidation states. In our case, unfortunately, the use of CuLMM Auger spectra of the samples is also difficult, because they are observed to be of low intensity against the background of the loss structure of the 1s-electron line of oxygen."
8,TEM study,"3.2 TEM study Typical micrographs of the surface of the initial sample are shown in Fig. 5 (a). Dark copper particles distributed over the surface of the alumina are visible in the photographs. The histogram of the distribution of copper particles by size is shown in Fig. 5 (b). It can be seen that the particle sizes are in the range from 3 to 20 nm. The average particle size of copper in the initial sample is 11 ± 2 nm. Typical photomicrographs of the catalyst surface after 100 h on stream are shown in Fig. 5 (c). The photograph shows dark copper particles distributed over the surface of the carrier. The histogram of the distribution of copper particles by size in the sample after catalysis is shown in Fig. 5 (d). It can be seen that the particle sizes are in the range from 10 to 200 nm. The average particle size of copper in the sample after catalysis is 100 ± 30 nm. The main reason for the enlargement of Cu catalyst particles, in our opinion, is the multiple oxidation-reduction transitions of copper during the catalysis. The effect of enlargement of supported particles during oxidation-reduction transformations is known in heterogeneous catalysis. In oxidized state, copper diffuses more easily over alumina surface, after that it is reduced and large agglomerates of metal-state copper are formed."
9,Conclusions,"We have here reported that Cu/Al2O3 catalysts containing 1–5 wt.% of copper are efficient systems for ethanol self-condensation into 1-butanol and higher linear α-alcohols. Combined selectivity of C4, C6 and C8 n-alcohols exceeding 96% at 30–33% ethanol conversion. Optimum temperature of the reaction was found to be 275 °C. Kinetic measurements showed that the increase of 1-butanol formation and ethanol conversion under supercritical regime may be explained with reduction of the diffusion barrier and providing the reaction proceeds in the kinetic region. Water content in the initial ethanol leads to its conversion proportional decrease. Nevertheless the water content practically does not affect the selectivity of 1-butanol. Thus, a dramatic decrease of ethanol conversion in the presence of water in the feeding ethanol may be caused by influence of the strong chemisorption of water on active catalytic sites or changing the acidic properties of the surface, or a combination of these factors. It was found that the charge state of copper does not affect the self-condensation parameters of ethanol. In the course of the resource experiment, it was found that the decrease in ethanol conversion is due to the significant agglomeration of the copper particles on the surface of aluminum oxide, i.e. a decrease in the catalytically active surface. In this case, the size of the copper particles has practically no effect on the selectivity of the formation of 1-butanol."
