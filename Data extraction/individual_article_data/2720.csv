0,Introduction,"With the advances arising from the Industrial Revolution and global population growth, the use of fossil fuels, a basis of global energy, has increased dramatically. These fuels are not renewable and are becoming scarce. Moreover, their combustion releases gases that increase the greenhouse effect and are harmful for the environment. Thus, studies on alternative energy sources have become increasingly relevant for maintaining the equilibrium of the economy and the ecosystems of the world [1]. Among these various alternative energy sources, hydrogen is largely studied as a future energy carrier. It is a clean energy source that has a very high energy content (142 kJ/g) and produces only molecules of water as the final product of the process [2]. Despite these advantages, the main difficulties in the use of hydrogen are its high production cost and unavailability in pure form [3]. Fifty million tons of hydrogen are traded worldwide, with a growth rate of almost 10% per year. Based on estimates of the national hydrogen program in the United States, the contribution of hydrogen to the total energy market may be approximately 10% by the year 2025 [3,4]. Today, 40% of the world's hydrogen supply is produced from natural gas, 30% from high-density oils and naphtha, 8% from coal, 4% from electrolysis, and 1% from biomass [5]. The latest research in this field has focused on physical–chemical or biological processes that enable hydrogen production. The biological approach appears to be the most promising, as it involves the use of wastewater, sewage, and different types of waste as nutrient sources for hydrogen-producing microorganisms. Many fermentative bacteria (Clostridium, Rumen bactéria, Thermoanaerobacter, Enterobacter) are capable of generating large amounts of hydrogen from carbohydrates [6]. Biological hydrogen production can occur through two processes: photosynthesis and fermentation. The latter is simpler because hydrogen, alcohols and volatile acids are obtained mainly from carbohydrates present in wastewaters, don't need light or pure cultures, and requires relatively low operating costs [7]. Furthermore, the acids produced (particularly butyric, acetic, and propionic acids) can be used by chemical and food industries [8]. A number of factors (temperature, design of the reactor, pH, hydraulic retention time, the type of inoculum and its treatment, the form of inoculation, hydrogen partial pressure and the characteristics and concentration of the substrate) affect the production of hydrogen in anaerobic reactors [9]. Several reactors have been tested for biohydrogen production, being the fixed-bed bioreactor a promising technology due to its capacity to retain biomass in a broad spectrum of support material and bed porosity. According Fernandes et al. [10], the type of support material used did not affect hydrogen production in a fixed-bed bioreactor fed with a sucrose-based synthetic wastewater, but the increase in the bed porosity was found to be positive for a long-term hydrogen production. However, instabilities on hydrogen production were observed in all experimental conditions. Such instabilities can be related to the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (fixation of CO2 or CO, thus converting it into acetyl-CoA) as methane was not detected in the biogas. This pathway was the main responsible for the instabilities observed by Fontes Lima and Zaiat [11] in the same type of reactor also fed with a sucrose-based substrate, with consumption of CO2 and H2 and production of acetate. Hydrogen generation using the fermentation process can be carried out at higher rates and lower cost using various organic substrates and wastewaters with either mixed or pure cultures [12]. Different types of wastewater are used as substrates for the production of biohydrogen, in which the source of organic carbonaceous material may be sucrose, glucose, xylose, wheat starch, organic solid waste, biological reactor effluent, vegetable oils, residues of biodiesel production, and dairy industry effluent (particularly whey). The common purpose of these studies has been to evaluate hydrogen productivity and operational stability [13]. As presented previously, recent studies using sucrose indicated the instability of the process, with the biogas production reaching a maximum value and then decreasing to low or even null values at the end of the operation [11,14] Furthermore, studies using glucose as a substrate demonstrated stability in biohydrogen production [15,16], which may indicate that the use of different substrates can lead to not only different metabolic pathways but also operational stabilities or instabilities. In this context, the main objective of this study was to compare the biological hydrogen production in an upflow anaerobic fixed-bed reactor using two different substrates (glucose and sucrose) in terms of not only numerical values but also the stability of the process."
1,Material and methods,
2,The reactor,"2.1 The reactor The experiments were performed in a bench-scale anaerobic fixed-bed reactor (Fig. 1 ), according to Fontes Lima and Zaiat [11]."
3,"The support material for biomass immobilization, the medium and the inoculum","2.2 The support material for biomass immobilization, the medium and the inoculum The material used to attach the biomass was recycled low-density polyethylene [11], obtained from the trims of a plastic recycling plant located in São Carlos-SP. Recycled low-density polyethylene is a non-porous material with a surface area of approximately 7.94 m2 g−1, an apparent density of 0.4 mg L−1, and a superficial area of 7.9 m2 g−1. The fixed bed had a porosity of 60%. The reactors were fed with a synthetically prepared effluent, with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 2000 mg L−1, sucrose (1781.24 mg L−1) or glucose (1875.00 mg L−1) as the main carbon source. The amounts of the other components (urea, sodium bicarbonate, hydrochloric acid and micronutrients) are described in Fontes Lima and Zaiat [11]. The inoculum was obtained from natural fermentation of the feed [8]."
4,The operation of the reactor and the analytical methods,"2.3 The operation of the reactor and the analytical methods The temperature of the system was maintained at 25 °C. The theoretical hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 2 h (flow rate of 21 mL min−1) and each experiment was operated during 60 days. The biogas flow was measured using a MilliGascounter (Ritter®) gas meter, the biogas composition (carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane) were measured by gas chromatography and concentrations of the organic acids were determined using a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) [11]. The sucrose and glucose concentrations were determined with a colorimetric method [17]. COD, pH and volatile suspended solids (VSS) values were analyzed according to the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater [18]."
5,Calculation of the parameters obtained,"2.4 Calculation of the parameters obtained Equations (1)–(10) were used to calculate the maximum and average values and standard deviation for the parameters of interest. Each equation is presented with the corresponding measurement units. Liquid flow in the reactor (Q): (1) Q ( mL · min − 1 ) = V HRT t in which V is the working volume of the reactor and HRT t is the theoretical HRT. Global rate of carbohydrate degradation (v S): (2) v S ( mmol · h − 1 ) = Q · ( C S 0 − C SF ) MM S in which C S0 is the influent carbohydrate concentration, C SF is the effluent carbohydrate concentration, and MMS is the carbohydrate molar mass. Biogas flow (Q g): (3) Q g ( mL · h − 1 ) = V m · F m t in which V m is the gas volume obtained in the gas meter, F m is the calibration factor of the gas meter, and t is the time of measurement. Hydrogen ( % H 2 ) , carbon dioxide ( % CO 2 ) , and methane ( % CH 4 ) in biogas: (4) % H 2 = η H 2 η (5) % CO 2 = η CO 2 η (6) % CH 4 = η CH 4 η in which η H 2 , η CO 2 and η CH 4 are the numbers of moles of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane contained in the biogas, respectively. This content was measured by chromatography and calculated by the chromatograph calibration curves. The η value corresponds to the total number of moles of gas injected in the sample, calculated using the ideal gas equation (Equation (7)). (7) η = P · V i R · T in which P is the gas pressure, V i is the volume of gas injected, R is the universal ideal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. In the present work, the gas pressure was 1 atm and the temperature was 25 °C (absolute temperature = 298 K). Hydrogen flow ( v H 2 ) : (8) v H 2 ( mmol · h − 1 ) = Q g · η H 2 V i Hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 ) : (9) Y H 2 ( mol H 2 · mol sac − 1 ) = v H 2 v S Hydrogen production (HPR): (10) HPR ( mL H 2 · h − 1 · L − 1 ) = Q g · % H 2 V HRTt in which V HRTt is the working volume of the reactor."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen production,"3.1 Hydrogen production The average and maximum results obtained for the carbohydrate degradation, biogas flow rate, percentage of hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the biogas, hydrogen flow rate, hydrogen yield, and hydrogen produced are provided in Table 1 . Fig. 2 shows the temporal variation of the carbohydrate degradation (2A), biogas flow rate (2B), hydrogen molar flow (2C), and hydrogen yield (2D). Substrate conversion was used to define the limit between the transient phase and the steady-state phase of the process (day 19 for each experiment). This approach was adopted because of the instability in hydrogen production in the process, mainly with sucrose as a substrate. The transient phase coincided with the maximum hydrogen production. Methane gas was not recorded at any operation stage. Although sucrose has a higher theoretical capacity to produce hydrogen (given that only acetic acid is generated as a final product, 1 mol of sucrose can generate 8 mol of hydrogen, whereas 1 mol of glucose is capable of generating 4 mol of hydrogen, what would be an ideal situation that does not occur in reactors with mixed culture), the results founded for the maximum stoichiometric potential in the experiments were close to each other. The reactor using sucrose as a substrate reached 40.20% of its maximum stoichiometric potential, whereas the reactor fed with glucose reached 37.68% of its own maximum stoichiometric potential, demonstrating that the values obtained for both substrates were similar, preventing a better determination of which carbohydrate is preferred for hydrogen production in this type of reactor. However, an interesting comparison can be made with other reactor configurations using the same types of substrate considered here. Table 2 provides a brief comparison with many papers found in the literature using sucrose as a substrate. Table 3 compares the present work with other reactor configurations using glucose as a substrate. The maximum yield values obtained for both sucrose and glucose are close to those obtained in other studies with different reactor configurations, allowing for the use of anaerobic upflow fixed-bed reactors for biohydrogen production. Considering the stability obtained with the other monitoring parameters of the reactors (degradation of carbohydrates, pH effluent, COD removal), these maximum values of hydrogen production would probably be the values maintained during the steady state, if instability problems had not occurred during the experiments. This instability, in fact, is the main topic of the present work, with greater emphasis given to it. Using the same reactor with different recirculation ratios for the effluent and sucrose acting as a substrate, Fontes Lima and Zaiat [11] could not reach process stability under any operating conditions. The same instability problem was reported by Penteado et al. [14], also using the same sucrose-fed reactor configuration, when evaluating the influence of seed sludge and pretreatment method on hydrogen production and by Fernandes et al. [10], studying the type of support material and the bed porosity in the same reactor configuration fed with a sucrose-based synthetic wastewater. The rates of hydrogen production reached a maximum and then decreased to low or even null values within approximately 60 days of operation. The same behavior was observed in the present work for sucrose (Fig. 2D). A boxplot was built for each condition using data from the steady-state hydrogen yield phase. As can be observed in Fig. 3 , the reduced height of the glucose box denotes higher data homogeneity, indicating that the hydrogen yield stability in the operation with this substrate was superior to that observed in the operation with sucrose. Moreover, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) (α = 0.05) was also performed for the same data (hydrogen yield in the steady-state phase). The calculated F value was 28.65, whereas the critical F was 4.21, thus demonstrating that there was a significant difference between the two conditions tested."
8,Intermediate products,"3.2 Intermediate products One possible explanation for the different behaviors presented by the different substrates is the intermediate products generated. The production of intermediate products did not differ greatly among the operation phases. There was a predominance of acetic acid, butyric acid, and ethanol. In addition to these products, other intermediates, such as propionic acid, n-butanol, acetone, isobutyric acid, methanol, caproic acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, citric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, and formic acid, were generated but in amounts below 50 mg L−1. Table 4 presents the average values and percentages of the main intermediate products, and Fig. 4 illustrates their time profile. Acetic acid, butyric acid, and ethanol were the main soluble products in both stages, and the first two of these products are indicators of the maximum hydrogen production [30]. The carbon balance was based on the effluent COD of the reactors to support the data obtained during the experiments. The COD output value was compared with the sum of the COD of the intermediate products in the effluent and the COD of the non-degraded carbohydrates and biomass in the output, estimated as VSS. Equations (11)–(16) provide the chemical reactions of the most significant metabolites and carbohydrates. (11) CH 3 COOH ( acetic acid ) + 2 O 2 → 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 O COD = 1.006 g O 2 /g acetic acid (12) CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH ( butyric acid ) + 5 O 2 → 4 CO 2 + 4 H 2 O COD = 1.818 g O 2 /g butyric acid (13) CH 3 CH 2 COOH ( propionic acid ) + 7 / 2 O 2 → 3 CO 2 + 3 H 2 O COD = 1.5135 g O 2 /g propionic acid (14) C 2 H 6 O ( ethanol ) + 2 O 2 → 2 CO 2 + 3 H 2 O COD = 1.391 g O 2 /g ethanol (15) C 12 H 22 O 11 ( sucrose ) + 12 O 2 → 12 CO 2 + 11 H 2 O COD = 1.123 g O 2 /g sucrose (16) C 6 H 12 O 6 ( glucose ) + 6 O 2 → 6 CO 2 + 6 H 2 O COD = 1.065 g O 2 /g glucose Table 5 present the average COD removal, the measured output COD, and the COD of the intermediate products detected in the effluent for both substrates. As can be observed, the difference between the measured COD and the sum of the COD of the intermediate products was less than 10%. This difference can be attributed to any intermediate products not detected by the methods used. According to Chaganti et al. [31], this difference can also be explained by biomass growth in the reactor."
9,Instability in the hydrogen production,"3.3 Instability in the hydrogen production The biogas production instability, affecting the yield and hydrogen production, was observed for the reactor fed with sucrose (Fig. 3). This unstable behavior was only observed for the gas phase, probably due to the consumption of biogas components; monitoring of the COD, carbohydrate content, and intermediate products demonstrates that the operation was stable. Therefore, based on the variables monitored in the liquid medium, the steady state was reached from the 19th day of operation. The consumption of hydrogen by methanogenic or sulfidogenic organisms can be excluded because methane and hydrogen sulfide were not detected in the biogas. Another possibility would be the development of microorganisms that produce propionic acid instead of acetic and butyric acid. Vavilin et al. [32] presented the overall equation for propionate production from glucose, demonstrating that this pathway involves the consumption of H2 (Equation (17)): (17) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O Thus, the production of propionate should be avoided. However, Fig. 2 indicates that the production of propionic acid did not change for both substrates when there was a decrease in the hydrogen production, maintaining low values compared with the other main intermediate products. In addition, butyrate is known to decrease when propionic acid is produced, what did not happen. Therefore, this hypothesis can also be refuted. The most coherent hypothesis is the development of a different microbial population in the reactors fed with glucose or sucrose, with different metabolic pathways in each reactor. In this case, the growth of homoacetogenic organisms, capable of using the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway [33], can explain the differences observed in the operating stability related to the gas phase. Some microorganisms, such as Clostridium ljungdahlii [33,34] and Clostridium carboxidivorans [35], are capable to grow heterotrophically on sugars (pentoses or hexoses) or autotrophically (Wood–Ljungdahl pathway) on gases (CO or CO2 + H2). According to Tanner et al. [33], cultures of C. ljungdahlii grown previously on fructose or H2CO2 required adaptation for growth on glucose. Moreover, Köpke et al. [33] reported that C. ljungdahlii could grow heterotrophically on glucose only after adaptation. Therefore, homoacetogenic organisms may be responsible for the instability of hydrogen production when the reactor was fed with sucrose, whereas the inability of such organisms to grow on glucose can explain the stabilization of hydrogen production in the reactor fed with the monosaccharide. To support this hypothesis, a mass balance was performed considering the overall reaction of the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway [35]: (18) 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 → CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O The concentrations of soluble products for the operation with sucrose indicated that the decrease in biogas production coincided with a simultaneous increase in acetic acid production (Figs. 2D and 3A, respectively). Comparing the maximum point reached in the limit between the transient and steady-state phases and the last day of operation, hydrogen exhibited a decrease of approximately 10.8 mmol L−1 and carbon dioxide presented a decrease of approximately 4.4 mmol L−1. In the other hand, acetic acid exhibited, in the same period, an increase of approximately 3.7 mmol L−1. These values are very close to the stoichiometry presented in Equation (18)."
10,Conclusions,"An upflow fixed-bed anaerobic reactor was fed with sucrose or glucose for hydrogen production. Maximum yields of 3.22 mol H2 mol−1 sucrose and 1.51 mol H2 mol−1 glucose were obtained, close to the values obtained by other studies with different reactor configurations. However, the most significant issue was the instability in the hydrogen production, which occurred throughout the operation with sucrose. This reduction in the biogas production may be caused by anaerobic homoacetogenic microorganisms, which use the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, in which CO2 + H2 is used to produce acetic acid."
