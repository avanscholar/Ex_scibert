0,Introduction,"Hundreds of bacterial species colonize and co-exist in the mouth forming complex associations of microorganisms known as dental plaque or oral biofilm (reviewed in Refs. 1,2). The oral biofilm usually comprises commensal microorganisms that are beneficial to the host, as they exclude colonization from pathogenic microorganisms that may induce disease. 2,3 The current concept on the role of oral bacteria in dental caries development involves a sucrose-induced ecological shift in the microbial composition towards cariogenic species. The cariogenic environment creates conditions for certain conditional pathogens to compete with the commensal flora more efficiently for the tooth surface eventually leading to disease. 4 Oral streptococci account for 20% of all supragingival microorganisms present in the oral biofilm, 5 but constitute about 80% of the initial colonizers during early biofilm development. 6 Certain streptococci have been associated with the onset and progression of carious lesions. Although Streptococcus mutans is an important player in caries pathogenesis due to its cariogenic traits, its role in caries is not etiological, as suggested for many years. 7 A correlation between caries experience with elevated numbers of S. mutans has been controversial. 8–13 Streptococcus sanguinis is a normal colonizer of the dental enamel. Its presence is associated with healthy biofilms and with the absence of caries. 14–16 To establish, S. sanguinis requires the hard tooth tissue 17 and its initial colonization takes place during a discrete “window of infectivity” in young children coinciding with tooth emergence. 18 S. sanguinis may inhibit S. mutans and compete for tooth colonization. Early evidence in rats showed a mutual exclusion between both species. 19 Interestingly, early colonization of S. sanguinis, demonstrated by elevated levels in the mouth, relates to delayed colonization by S. mutans. Conversely, S. mutans colonization of teeth was accompanied by low levels of S. sanguinis. 18 Furthermore, studies have shown that caries-free children have elevated counts of S. sanguinis in saliva and in the dental biofilm compared to children with carious lesions who, instead, presented elevated numbers of S. mutans. 15 H2O2 production has been proposed as a plausible inhibitory mechanism of S. sanguinis over S. mutans, in vitro. 20 Several commensal oral streptococci grown under aerobic conditions utilize oxygen to produce H2O2 and subsequently inhibit S. mutans. Conversely, when these microorganisms are grown in an anaerobic environment, the lack of oxygen and therefore a diminished H2O2 production decreases the capacity of oral commensal bacteria, such as S. sanguinis, to effectively compete with S. mutans. 21 A ratio between S. mutans/S. sanguinis has been suggested to be helpful in determining caries risk. Hence, a low ratio would imply a low risk of caries and conversely, a high ratio would indicate high caries risk. 22 A study conducted to verify this potential risk assessment tool, though, failed to show an association. 23 Although a higher number of S. sanguinis over S. mutans has been associated with caries-free children, 15 no information is available on whether this relation persists in adults. If this pattern is maintained in adults, S. sanguinis could serve as an additional caries risk marker. This study, therefore, sought to find if carious lesion-free adults have higher salivary levels of S. sanguinis and lower counts of S. mutans than those with high number of lesions and vice versa. As a second aim, we tested the hypothesis that S. sanguinis from carious lesion-free adults produced more H2O2 than those strains coming from high caries individuals."
1,Materials and methods,"The study consisted of two parts; in the first part, saliva samples from participants were collected to obtain the number of colonies (CFU/mL) of total streptococci as well as S. mutans and S. sanguinis from both study groups. In the second part, S. sanguinis isolates from the same subjects were used to quantify H2O2 production to compare both groups. A more detailed methodology is presented below."
2,Subjects,"2.1 Subjects A non-probabilistic sample of 40 subjects was selected for this cross sectional study. Age of the participants was between 18 and 32 years old with a mean of 25 years of age. All subjects were Chileans, whose race is mainly a mix of Europeans and Amerindian descents. Subjects were selected based on the presence or absence of carious lesions. Clinical records were revised and potential subjects meeting the inclusion criteria were invited to enrol the study. A trained and calibrated investigator on ICDAS II methodology 24 examined subjects that were recruited from those regularly attending the dental clinics of the University of Talca, Chile. Subjects were divided into two groups: high caries (HC) and carious lesion-free (CF). To be included in the study and to be considered as HC, subjects had to have a minimum of eight non-cavitated carious lesions coded as 1, 2 or 3 ICDAS II, at both visual and bitewing radiographic examination. CF individuals, on the other hand, had to be ICDAS II=0 and have no restoration on any tooth surface. Subjects that had lost teeth due to caries, with systemic diseases related with caries that affect the salivary flow, such as Sjögren's syndrome, that had taken antibiotics during the last two months, that regularly consumed alcohol or that used medications known to alter salivary flow and that wore orthodontic appliances, were excluded from the study. Subjects from the CF group were age-matched with those from the HC group to avoid the variable age in the analysis, but not gender-matched. All the participants signed an informed consent and the study protocol was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the University of Talca."
3,Saliva samples and microbiological procedures,"2.2 Saliva samples and microbiological procedures Participants were instructed to have their last tooth brushing after lunch time (around 2:00PM) and their last meal after dinner (around 8:00PM), the day before saliva sample collection. If needed, only drinking water or rinsing their mouth with water up to 1h before the exam was allowed. Saliva flow was stimulated by chewing parafilm and it was collected in a 15mL sterile tube in the morning (9:00AM) by a single investigator, following a previously reported protocol. 25 Samples were immediately transported on ice to the laboratory for microbiological processing. Saliva obtained from the participants was homogenized in a mixer (Maxi Mix II 37600 Mixer, Thermolyne, Iowa, USA) for 30s and immediately serially diluted to 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000 and 1:10,000 (v/v) with 0.9% NaCl at pH 7.0. A 10μL aliquot of each sample was seeded in duplicate onto agar plates. Selective mitis salivarius sucrose bacitracin (MSB, Difco, Le pont de Claix, France), 26 mitis salivarius (MS, Difco) 27 and MM10 28 media were used for detection and counting of S. mutans, total oral streptococci and S. sanguinis, respectively. Plates were anaerobically incubated at 37°C for 48h for S. mutans and total streptococci 26 and 72h for S. sanguinis. 29 Phenotypic identification and counting was carried out from each plate under magnification (10×) using the dilution that allowed the best visualization of individual colonies, according to previously reported criteria. 27 Final numbers of each species were adjusted by the corresponding dilution factor and expressed as CFU/mL of clinical saliva sample."
4,H2O2 production by S. sanguinis,"2.3 H2O2 production by S. sanguinis Colonies growing on MM10 medium were phenotypically identified under the microscope as S. sanguinis when they were grey, rough, hard and difficult to detach with a platinum loop and showed α-hemolysis. 27 S. sanguinis SK36 was used as reference for identification of the colonies. Only plates from 10 subjects in each group showed clearly identifiable and separate S. sanguinis colonies. From those, however, it was possible to enumerate 26 colonies identified as S. sanguinis from the MM10 agar plates of HC subjects and 48 colonies from the plates of CF subjects. Each colony positively identified as S. sanguinis on the MM10 agar plate and clearly separated from adjacent colonies was counted first and then removed from the agar plate to inoculate independent 1mL BHI broth tubes. Each culture was anaerobically incubated for 12h at 37°C. S. sanguinis cultures were homogenized and inoculated onto Prussian blue agar by dropping 10μL directly onto triplicate plates. 30 This agar allows for the detection of bacterial H2O2 production. The reaction comprises the combination of hexacyanoferrate(III) and iron(III) in aqueous solution, which originates a blue precipitate of Prussian blue in the presence of H2O2. H2O2 in the reaction acts as a reducing agent. Prussian blue agar medium is based on BHI broth (Brain Heart Infusion, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Prussian blue reagents have intrinsic peroxidase-like catalytic activity towards H2O2-mediated oxidation of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt to produce a coloured product. 31 Plates were aerobically cultured at 37°C for 4 days. Wild-type S. sanguinis SK36 was used as positive control for H2O2 production. After the incubation period, H2O2 production by S. sanguinis cells was quantified (mm) by measuring the blue halos formed with a digital calliper (Digimatic Calliper, Mitutoyo, Japan) and the mean (±SD) is presented."
5,Statistical analysis,"2.4 Statistical analysis Data from both parts of the study were registered in a spread sheet and a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to assess normality in the distribution of the values. Since distribution was not normal, the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the differences of each species within each caries group. Differences were considered significant if p <0.05. Data were processed using the SPSS v.15 software."
6,Results,"The HC group consisted of six females and 14 males, whereas the CF of 11 females and nine males. All the 20 participants from the HC group met the inclusion criteria having at least eight non-cavitated lesions (codes 1, 2 and 3 ICDAS), with a mean of 14 (±5.6) non-cavitated and 2.6 (±2.3) cavitated (codes 4, 5 and 6 ICDAS) lesions."
7,Salivary counts of oral streptococci,"3.1 Salivary counts of oral streptococci Although counts differed between both groups, it was possible to obtain both types of streptococci in all subjects. Table 1 shows salivary counts of S. mutans, S. sanguinis and total streptococci. Significant higher counts of total streptococci were recovered from saliva of HC subjects when compared to CF participants (p =0.018), with 5.09×106 (±2.26×106) and 6.24×105 (± 7.99×104) CFU/mL, respectively (Table 1). Likewise, when S. mutans counts were compared, HC subjects had higher counts than CF participants (p <0.001) with 3.76×106 (±1.54×106) and 8.62×104 (±2.9×104) CFU/mL, respectively (Table 1). Conversely, S. sanguinis was significantly more abundant (p =0.004) in CF subjects with 3.33×105 (±3×104) than in HC individuals who had 2.20×105 (±3.01×104) CFU/mL (Table 1). To study the relative predominance of the individual species, the number of colonies in saliva of S. mutans and S. sanguinis were compared within each study group. In the HC group, S. mutans showed higher counts than S. sanguinis (p =0.001) Conversely, CF individuals had lower S. mutans levels than S. sanguinis (p =0.001)."
8,H2O2 production by S. sanguinis isolates from CF and HF subjects,"3.2 H2O2 production by S. sanguinis isolates from CF and HF subjects For the assessment of H2O2 production by S. sanguinis in both groups, all colonies identified as S. sanguinis and growing separately on MM10 medium were isolated and used for the second phase of the study. Only 10 subjects per group showed at least one clearly distinguishable and separate S. sanguinis colony on MM10 agar. From those, it was possible to collect a total of 26 colonies from the MM10 plates of the HC group and 48 colonies from the plates of the CF group. Independent BHI medium was inoculated with each S. sanguinis colony and then seeded onto Prussian blue agar plates to determine the H2O2 production ability. A total of eight and 32 colonies showed H2O2 production by blue halo formation in the HC and CF groups, respectively (Table 2 ). While 66.7% of the colonies of S. sanguinis in the CF group displayed halo formation on the Prussian blue agar, only 30.8% produced the compound in the HC group (Fig. 1 ). When halos formed by S. sanguinis from either study group were measured, CF showed larger halos than HC subjects (p =0.012) with a mean diameter of 1.53 (±2.68) mm and 0.89 (1.77) mm, respectively (Table 2)."
9,Discussion,"The antagonistic effect of S. sanguinis against S. mutans is of particular interest in caries research, and it has been extensively investigated, both in vitro 20–22,32 and in clinical studies. 15,18,23 The putative beneficial role of S. sanguinis as part of the dental biofilm warrants further investigation of how competition might determine the final composition of the community and the overall effect on the host. Our study confirms that S. sanguinis prevails over S. mutans, at least numerically, in the oral biofilm of caries-free subjects. Several studies on this topic have been conducted in children, 15,18,23 but clinical evidence of this antagonistic relationship between both bacterial species in adults is insufficient. Hence, we decided to test the hypothesis that in adults with opposite caries histories, S. sanguinis and S. mutans levels show an inverse relationship. Our results indicate that adults with an extensive history of caries, as determined by several carious lesions, have in general more streptococci in their saliva than people without caries experience. Likewise, S. mutans was significantly more abundant in saliva from HC than CF. Although no etiological, 7 S. mutans has long been associated with caries. 33 Confirming this association, we found high levels of S. mutans in HC subjects and much lower levels in CF adults. Importantly, the number of S. mutans in high caries adults was over 100-fold increased compared with caries-free participants. Consistent with previous studies reported in children, 15 we found higher levels of S. sanguinis in adults without a history of caries when compared to individuals with several carious lesions (Table 1). We used saliva samples to evaluate the relative oral bacterial load of both species in the mouth. 34 Saliva better represents the global colonization of the mouth and allows a general conclusion about the colonization by the species. 35 We deem important to state that not all the MM10 plates from either group revealed the presence of S. sanguinis. Indeed, only half of the plates showed at least one colony. More S. sanguinis could have been present on the MM10 plates, but phenotypical identification required isolated colonies that resembled the SK36 strain positive control. Further studies should consider sequencing techniques for species identification. It is important to highlight that both species were cultured in different culture media. This approach had been utilized by a previous study addressing the same question, but in children with early childhood caries. 15 Although this approach does not allow a direct comparison of the absolute numbers of colonies between the two species, it permits to observe the relative predominance of one species within each caries experience group. Hence, HC adults clearly show higher counts of S. mutans than S. sanguinis in their saliva, but participants without carious lesions show the opposite trend (Table 1). Saliva and not plaque was the source of the analyzed species. This decision was made because it has been described that S. mutans levels in saliva reflect the overall colonization of the microorganism on the teeth and can be considered as an ‘average’ for the individual oral load of the microorganism. 35 To maximize the representation of the species in saliva from mature biofilms, we instructed subjects to avoid brushing and to have their last meal at least 18 and 12h before sample collection, respectively. Although several exclusion criteria were used, including participants who had taken antibiotics or any other antibacterial substance, no dietary intervention was used in the study. It may well be that the type of diet influences the dynamic and the composition of the oral biofilm, as it has been suggested. 36 Despite the limitations of the study, results seem to support the idea of an antagonistic relation between S. sanguinis and S. mutans within the dental biofilm. Interspecies competition has been documented in the available literature, 20 but the exact mechanisms on how it occurs are far from being comprehensively understood. Although the possible molecular mechanisms of the competition between S. sanguinis and S. mutans has been reported 21 they have been mostly performed in vitro. The present study used clinical samples to assess bacterial quantities in saliva and also aimed to explore the mechanisms that may explain why S. sanguinis predominates in CF subjects. H2O2 production has been reported to be a key mechanism of S. sanguinis to preclude tooth colonization by S. mutans. 20 On the other hand, S. mutans has the capacity to outcompete commensal species by producing bacteriocins, known as mutacins. 37 Under certain environmental conditions, S. mutans produces mutacins I and IV inhibiting S. sanguinis. 20 These environmentally mediated competitive mechanisms have great influence on the composition of the oral biofilm and may explain the predominance of cariogenic species verified in clinical studies. Higher H2O2 formation by S. sanguinis from CF subjects compared to HC subjects was observed (Table 2), supporting the role of H2O2 in maintaining a healthy biofilm. Although H2O2 production is rather ubiquitous among streptococci, S. sanguinis is resistant against its own H2O2, while having an inhibitory effect on cariogenic S. mutans. 38 It is difficult to argue that predominance of S. sanguinis in vivo, as we show here, is due solely to higher H2O2 production since there might be multiple variables affecting the dynamics of the oral biofilm. Yet, this may be a plausible mechanism involved. When both bacteria are co-cultured in a dual-species biofilm model with a much more controlled environmental conditions, S. mutans growth is inhibited by S. sanguinis. 39 Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of S. sanguinis over S. mutans is accompanied by an inhibition of several S. mutans genes related with virulence. Therefore, H2O2 may be implicated not only in direct killing, but also in modulating expression of S. mutans virulence genes. Further studies should explore competition in the actual oral biofilm looking at gene expression of candidate virulence genes. Competition in the oral biofilm does not necessarily mean to eradicate the competitor, but maintaining it at low levels. Instead of the traditional use of S. mutans counts as a caries risk factor, a new approach could be taken by using S. sanguinis counts as a biomarker. Like with S. mutans, nevertheless, it is possible that the mere count of colonies from the biofilm or from saliva is not enough to discriminate risk. Proportion of both species in the same individual appears more appealing to assess risk, but further research is needed to actually verify this type of potential application. Moreover, these results suggest a correlation between the ability to produce H2O2 by S. sanguinis and the caries-free status. These findings contribute to better understand the complexity of the dynamic of the oral biofilm in health and diseases. Further studies on S. sanguinis properties may shed light on some novel anti-caries strategies."
10,Conclusions,"Our findings strongly suggest that S. mutans may be predominant with respect to S. sanguinis in saliva of adults with current high caries experience. On the other hand, S. sanguinis appears to prevail over S. mutans in saliva of adults without any caries experience. S. sanguinis isolated from those caries-free subjects seems to produce more H2O2 than the same species isolated from people with several carious lesions."
