0,Introduction,"The production of biodiesel has increased substantially over the past decade as the alternative energy resource to solve the shortage of fossil fuels and the release of greenhouse gases. According to national biodiesel board, the production capacity of biodiesel has reached 700 million gallons/year in 2008 [1]. For every gallon biodiesel produced, 1 pound glycerol is produced as one of the major by-products in biodiesel waste streams [2]. This overproduction of glycerol lowered the price of purified glycerol from $1.00/lb in 1995 to $0.38/lb in 2005 [3]. In addition, short-chain aliphatic alcohols (e.g. methanol) and catalysts (e.g. NaOH or KOH) used in the biodiesel production process also exist in biodiesel waste stream [4], which make the glycerol in biodiesel waste streams difficult to use. Although most of the impurities can be removed by vacuum distillation and carbon treatment (a method for removing organic contaminants using carbon as absorbent), these processes are energy intensive [5] and pose the obstacles for the real-world application of the crude glycerol generated from biodiesel waste streams. Several energy efficient processes (e.g. combustion, composting, anaerobic digestion, and thermo-chemical or biological conversions to value-added products) for utilizing glycerol have been investigated [6–10], among which anaerobic fermentation has gained most intention, since it produces hydrogen in biogas as a clean energy and ethanol, butanol, and 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) as valuable liquid products [11–15]. Anaerobic fermentation of crude glycerol from biodiesel waste streams using either pure cell cultures (e.g. Clostridium butyricum, Escherichia coli) [6,16,17] or mixed cultures (e.g. wheat soil, compost, and wastewater sludge) [12,13,18] have been performed. However, most of these studies were conducted in the batch-mode bioreactors, in which hydrogen produced accumulated in the headspace of the bioreactors. The gas-collection approach or the gas-collection interval (GCI) was not clearly described in literature. Specifically, GCI was the parameter indicating the gas-collection frequency and the time duration between two contiguous gas collections from the headspace. Unlike continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) where hydrogen generated from anaerobic reactions can be continuously collected (or released) from headspace [19], hydrogen was accumulated in the headspace of batch-mode reactors. It was found that the accumulation of hydrogen inhibited anaerobic fermentation and decreased the specific hydrogen yields, due to the buildup of hydrogen partial pressure (HPP) in the headspace [19–22]. Additionally, higher HPP could increase hydrogen absorption to the fermentation solution, thus possibly affecting the metabolic fermentative pathways. Hydrogen retention time (HyRT) indicates the average retention time that hydrogen gas stays in the headspace of reactors. The HyRT of the batch reactors mainly depends on the duration of GCI (gas collection frequencies). Longer GCI (or lower frequency of gas collection) leads to longer HyRT and increases the contact time of hydrogen and fermentation solution, which is expected to accelerate the absorption of hydrogen to the solution and lower the pH of the solution. In addition, the initial gas collection time point (IGCT, a parameter indicating the gas collection/sampling starting time from the headspace of reactors) also affects HyRT in the batch-mode fermentation. Because the lag time for gas production in anaerobic fermentation of glycerol was around 18 h [7], an IGCT longer than 20 h was expected to prolong HyRT in batch-mode fermentors. Fermentation is carried out through different metabolic pathways depending on the bacterial types and the operational conditions. In anaerobic fermentation of glycerol, 1,3-PD is produced in a reductive pathway (Fig. 1 , adapted from [23]) and competes with the oxidative pathways of hydrogen production and other liquid products (e.g. ethanol, acetate and butyrate). Compared with the other liquid products (e.g. ethanol, butynol), 1,3-PD has much higher market values and is an important component of industrial polyesters which are widely used in thermoplastics, textiles, carpets, and upholstery [14]. Additionally, 1,3-PD is only produced from glycerol fermentation, not from glucose fermentation [13,23]. Thereby, anaerobic fermentation of glycerol has a unique advantage of harvesting 1,3-PD as a valuable liquid product. Hydrogen accumulation caused by longer HyRT could increase hydrogen concentration in liquid phase, lower the pH of fermentation solution, affect the metabolic pathways of acidogenic bacteria and hydrogenic bacteria, and ultimately affect hydrogen yields and 1,3-PD yields. Therefore, it is critical to effectively solve hydrogen accumulation in batch-mode fermentation treatment of glycerol in order to achieve high 1,3-PD production and hydrogen production. In terms of inocula for anaerobic fermentation of glycerol, organic soil containing diverse anaerobic microorganisms and rich in nutrients was used previously [12,13]. Because the metabolic activities of microorganisms and the nutrient levels could decrease over time after the organic soil was collected, fresh organic soil was normally stored in sealed bags at 4 °C refrigerators [24]. It is important to understand whether the soil freshness affected the anaerobic fermentation efficiency. Different soil sources (e.g. compost, potato soil, and soybean soil) were compared in anaerobic hydrogen-producing reactors [20]. The impact of the freshness of tomato soil on hydrogen yields using different substrates (e.g. glucose, sucrose, lactate, and potato starch) was studied, and the results showed that the soils collected over 1 month had no clear effect on gas production [24]. Until now, it was unclear whether the long-term stored organic soil (e.g. 2–6 months) could have less hydrogen yields or less liquid yields than the fresh collected organic soil. Researchers at the University of Connecticut have successfully produced biodiesel fuel from vegetable oil [25]. The biodiesel waste stream contains (by mass): 61.6% methanol, 26.5% glycerol, 5.8% potassium hydroxide (KOH), and 6.1% biodiesel [26]. Separation steps were developed to purify glycerol in the biodiesel waste streams [27], in which four purification levels of glycerol, namely, phase 0 (P0), phase 1(P1), phase 2 (P2) and phase 3 (P3), were achieved. Specifically, KOH in P0, methanol in P1, and the non-polar layer (biodiesel leftover) in P2 were removed from each purification step to produce P1, P2 and P3 glycerol [26,27], respectively. In this study, these four purification levels (P0, P1, P2, and P3) of glycerol from biodiesel waste streams were examined in anaerobic fermentation tests for high production of hydrogen and 1,3-PD. There were three objects in this study. First, hydrogen yield and 1,3-PD yield of these biodiesel glycerol products were examined in the batch-mode fermentors. The effects of glycerol purification steps on anaerobic fermentation were elucidated. Second, the impacts of HyRT on hydrogen yields and liquid product yields were investigated to explore the relationship between GCI, IGCT, and anaerobic fermentation of glycerol. The correlations of the hydrogen yield, 1,3-PD yield and other liquid product yield (e.g. ethanol, acetate) were established. A kinetic model was developed to simulate the trends of hydrogen/1,3-PD production at different GCIs and IGCTs. Third, the effects of soil freshness on anaerobic fermentation were examined by comparing the performances of the six-month-old organic soil and fresh organic soil."
1,Material and methods,
2,Batch fermentation reactor setup and operational conditions,"2.1 Batch fermentation reactor setup and operational conditions Serum bottles (volume: 160 mL) (Wheaton Scientific, Millville, NJ) were used in this study as batch-mode anaerobic bioreactors [28]. A nutrient solution of 120 mL (consisting of per liter of water: 2.0 g NH4HCO3, 1.0 g KH2PO4, 100 mg MgSO4·7H2O, 10 mg NaCl, 10 mg Na2MoO4·2H2O, 10 mg CaCl2·2H2O, 15 mg MnSO4·7H2O, and 2.78 mg FeCl2) was used as the inorganic medium for anaerobic bacteria to grow [24]. Organic soil collected from an organic farm near the University of Connecticut was used as inocula [28]. The soil was stored at 4 °C and then pre-heated at 105 °C for 2 h to eliminate methanogens and select for hydrogen-producing bacteria [15]. The soil was then added into the bioreactors along with the nutrient solution. The soil concentration was kept as 15 g/L in all the tests. The fermentative solution was well mixed in the bioreactors and then buffered with 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid and hydrate 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (MES hydrate, Sigma-Aldrich) [28]. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.0 with MES in all tests and was further adjusted to 5.5 using hydrochloric acid (HCl) [28]. The final volume of the fermentation solution was 120 mL, which made the volume of the headspace as 40 mL. The volume ratio of the headspace to the bioreactor volume was designed as 25% in order to shorten the lag period of gas pressure accumulation [24]. All the bioreactors were constantly stirred at 350 rpm on a stirrer (Variomag poly stirrer, Thermo Corporation) at 30 °C during the test period [28]. Before the tests, the fermentative solution was sparged with nitrogen for 10 min to reduce oxygen concentration [28]. The bioreactors were then sealed with rubber septum (Wheaton Scientific, Millville, NJ). The oxygen left in the headspace was expelled by injecting nitrogen to the headspace. This procedure guaranteed an anaerobic environment in the batch-mode bioreactors. Pure glycerol and biodiesel glycerol were used as the organic substrates, and the glycerol concentrations were examined at three levels (3, 5 and 7 g/L). In these batch-mode tests, a metabolic cycle was considered complete after hydrogen production stopped in fermentation solution."
3,Control test with soil,"2.2 Control test with soil Organic substances (e.g. roots, manure, organic acids, carbohydrates, humic acids, etc. [29].) originally contained in organic soil could be utilized/degraded by anaerobic bacteria, so a control test with soil only (without the addition of glycerol) was conducted under each operational condition in order to identify the contribution of these organic substances to the production of hydrogen and liquid products [28]. The actual generation of hydrogen and liquid products (e.g. 1,3-PD) from the degradation of glycerol (pure glycerol or biodiesel glycerol) equals the hydrogen and liquid products generated from glycerol as the substrates minus the hydrogen and liquid products generated from soil in the control tests [28]."
4,Hydrogen gas measurement and analytical methods,"2.3 Hydrogen gas measurement and analytical methods The hydrogen concentration in the headspace of anaerobic bioreactors was analyzed by collecting the biogas generated in the headspace using a 50 μL gas tight syringe (Gastight #1705, Hamilton Co. Reno, Nevada) and then analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) equipped with a packed column (60/80 Carboxen-1000, Supelco, PA) and a thermal conductivity detector. The total volume of the biogas generated in the headspace was measured by inserting a 160 mL gas-tight syringe into the headspace and collecting the biogas. Due to the high gas pressure in the headspace, the biogas will push the syringe plunger against the atmospheric pressure until the equilibrium was reached. The gas volume was then recorded. Different levels of GCIs (gas collection interval, 2.5, 5.5, 8.5, 13.0 and 20.0 h) and IGCTs (initial gas collection time point, 15, 45 and 65 h) were examined to determine the effects of HPP on fermentation performance. The hydrogen generation was calculated based on the following equation (Eqs. (1)–(3)): (1) V H 2 , 1 = ( 40 + V 1 ) ∗ C 1 (2) V H 2 , 2 = ( 40 + V 2 ) ∗ C 2 − 40 ∗ C 1 ⋯ (3) V H 2 , n = ( 40 + V n ) ∗ C n − 40 ∗ C n − 1 where 40 is the headspace volume (mL) of bioreactors; V H 2 , 1 , V H 2 , 2 and V H 2 , n are the hydrogen volume calculated based on the 1st, 2nd and nth times of gas collection; V 1, V 2 and V n are the gas volume measured on the 1st, 2nd and nth times of gas collection; C 1, C 2, C n−1 and C n are the hydrogen concentrations (by volume) measured on the 1st, 2nd, (n − 1)th and nth times of gas collection, respectively. The total hydrogen volume generated was calculated by adding all the hydrogen volumes calculated from each gas collection (Eq. (4)): (4) V H 2 , total = ∑ i n V H 2 , i Specific hydrogen yield (mol/mol glycerolconsumed) was defined as hydrogen generated (mole) per mole glycerol consumed."
5,Liquid production measurement and analytical methods,"2.4 Liquid production measurement and analytical methods The liquid products including 1,3-PD, acetate, butyrate, methanol, and ethanol were measured with a gas chromatograph (GC) (Agilent 6890N) equipped with a fused silica capillary (007 series bonded phase fused silica capillary) and flame ionization detector (FID). Prior to analysis, all liquid samples were filtered through filter membrane filters with 0.2 mm pore size to remove all dissolved solid substances [19]. After each test, the residual glycerol in the fermentative solution was measured with an enzyme based kit (free glycerol reagent, Sigma–Aldrich) and a spectrophotometer (Cary 50, Varian, CA) [19]. The pH of the fermentative solution was measured at the end of each test using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Accumet AP72). Liquid products yield (mol/mol glycerolconsumed) was defined as liquid products generated (mole) per mole glycerol consumed."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"Effects of glycerol concentrations, GCI and IGCT on hydrogen and liquid products yields","3.1 Effects of glycerol concentrations, GCI and IGCT on hydrogen and liquid products yields The anaerobic fermentation of P2 and P3 glycerol using fresh soil as inocula was conducted at three glycerol concentrations (3, 5, and 7 g/L). The results showed that the glycerol concentrations (3–7 g/L) did not clearly affect hydrogen yields and liquid products yields at various GCIs and IGCTs tested (Figs. 2–6 ), which indicated that glycerol concentration was not the critical factor for anaerobic fermentation of glycerol. However, other studies [18,28] with glucose as the substrate and broader concentrations (1–30 g/L) had found that glycerol concentrations affected the hydrogen yields, especially at high glycerol concentrations. It is possible that low glycerol concentrations (e.g. lower than 10 g/L) did not substantially affect hydrogen yields and liquid products yield, but would affect them at high concentrations. In addition, there was only little difference in hydrogen yields and liquid products yields between P2 and P3 glycerol (Fig. 2), even though P3 glycerol had a higher purification level than P2 glycerol. This indicates that the impurities (biodiesel leftover) in P2 glycerol had no significant influence on anaerobic fermentation. When P0 and P1 glycerol were used as the substrates, hydrogen yields were comparable with P2 and P3 glycerol under the same GCI/IGCT, but liquid products yields (including 1,3-PD yield) were low (all products yields were less than 0.05 mol/mol glycerolconsumed). High methanol contents (61.56% and 62.49% by mass [26]) in P0 and P1 glycerol inhibited 1,3-PD yields. Longer GCI and IGCT were expected to increase HyRT in the headspace of reactors. To study the effects of GCI and IGCT on hydrogen yields and liquid products yields, five sets of GCI and IGCT were examined with GCI ranging from 2.5 h to 20 h and IGCT from 15 h to 65 h. The tests started at the lower end of GCI 5.5 h and IGCT 15 h (Fig. 2), in which HyRT was short. The hydrogen yields reached 0.47–0.71 mol/mol glycerolconsumed, which were higher than the reported hydrogen yields under the same experimental condition [13]. Liquid products only contained ethanol and 1,3-PD with high ethanol yields (0.35–0.53 mol/mol glycerolconsumed) and low 1,3-PD yields (0–0.20 mol/mol glycerolconsumed). Previous study did not find the ethanol production at the same condition [13]. Moreover, P3 glycerol had stable hydrogen and ethanol yields among different glycerol concentrations (3–7 g/L), while the yields from P2 glycerol varied substantially with glycerol concentrations. The hydrogen yield of the 3 g/L P2 glycerol was higher than those of the 5 g/L and 7 g/L P2 glycerol (Fig. 2). Although it is unclear about the mechanism causing the distinct yield variations in P2 glycerol, the dark non-polar layer “biodiesel leftover” in P2 glycerol could affect the fermentative performance of the anaerobic bacteria or block the contact between the bacteria and glycerol substrates in batch-mode biofermentors. The high yields of hydrogen at the short GCI and IGCT verified our hypothesis that shorter HyRT alleviated the HPP in the batch-mode bioreactors, decreased the hydrogen absorption activity in the fermentation broth, and thus proceeding anaerobic reactions well. Based on the fermentation pathways, pyruvate is produced as the intermediate in the oxidation pathways of glycerol anaerobic fermentation (Fig. 1 [23],). The electrons (e−) generated later combine with protons (H+) to form hydrogen gas (H2). The higher yields of hydrogen enhance the production of Acetyl coenzyme A (Acetyl-CoA) and other liquid products (e.g. ethanol, butyrate and acetate) [23], which well explains the high yields of hydrogen and ethanol at short GCIs and IGCTs in this study. On the other hand, the production of 1,3-PD occurs in the reductive metabolic pathway, which is different from the formation pathways of ethanol and hydrogen. The low yields of 1,3-PD at short GCIs and IGCTs indicated that the production of 1,3-PD was suppressed by the high production of ethanol and hydrogen. To further decrease HyRT, GCI was shortened to 2.5 h without changing IGCT (15 h). The hydrogen yields reached at 0.53–0.75 mol/mol glycerolconsumed (Fig. 3), and the average values for both P2 and P3 glycerol were higher than those at the GCI of 5.5 h (Fig. 2). However, since the hydrogen yields for P2 glycerol varied substantially (0.47–0.71 mol/mol glycerolconsumed) at three glycerol concentrations, the increase in hydrogen yields (from Fig. 2 to Fig. 3) was not significant for P2 glycerol. As indicated previously, the dark non-polar layer “biodiesel leftover” in P2 glycerol could cause this unstable hydrogen yield. Ethanol was still the only liquid product with the yields of 0.33–0.71 mol/mol glycerolconsumed, the maximum yield of which was much higher than that at the GCI of 5.5 h (Fig. 2). The results clearly indicated that shorter HyRT at short GCI and IGCT enhanced the yields of hydrogen and ethanol, and the positive correlation of the two yields proved that ethanol and H2 productions share the same metabolic pathway. However, 1,3-PD was not detected in any liquid products, which confirmed that that the enhancement in the oxidation pathways (the production of hydrogen and ethanol) at short HyRT suppressed the reduction pathways (the production of 1,3-PD) [23]. HyRT was then prolonged by increasing GCI (8.5 h) without changing IGCT (15 h) (Fig. 4). Two major changes in the products were observed. First, hydrogen and ethanol yields substantially decreased compared with those at short GCIs (Figs. 2 and 3). The average hydrogen and ethanol yields were 0.26 and 0.17 mol/mol glycerolconsumed. Second, 1,3-PD, acetic acid, and butyric acid started to exist in the liquid products (Fig. 4). The average yields for 1,3-PD, acetic acid, and butyric acid were 0.42, 0.12, and 0.05 mol/mol glycerolconsumed, respectively. The 1,3-PD yield found in this study was comparable with the highest 1,3-PD yield (0.46 mol/mol glycerolconsumed) previously reported under the same conditions [13]. Longer HyRT at longer GCI and IGCT was supposed to increase the hydrogen absorption to the fermentative solution and further affect the metabolic pathways and fermentative products yields. With the enhanced absorption of hydrogen to the solution at longer HyRT, the fermentation reactions slowed down, which caused the substantial decrease in the production of hydrogen and ethanol. However, the reductive formation of 1,3-PD was enhanced at longer HyRT. Based on the anaerobic metabolic pathways (Fig. 1 [23],), the formation pathways of acetate and butyrate are different from those of ethanol, but they all come from the same intermediate (Acetyl-CoA). The inhibition of hydrogen production would increase the formation of Acetyl-CoA and further increase the formation of acetate and butyrate (Fig. 4). Based on the results of high yields of hydrogen and ethanol at short HyRT (Figs. 2 and 3) and low yields of hydrogen and ethanol at long HyRT (Fig. 4), it is possible that the hydrogenase would benefit the formation of ethanologenic enzyme, and hydrogen production would benefit the ethanol yield. Both GCI and IGCT were then further extended to 13 h and 45 h, respectively, to examine the fermentation of glycerol at even longer HyRT. It was expected that longer GCI/IGCT suppressed the hydrogen production by increased hydrogen absorption in the solution at longer HyRT. The average yields for hydrogen, ethanol, acetic acid, butyric acid were 0.20, 0.05, 0.06, 0.02 mol/mol glycerolconsumed, respectively (Fig. 5), all of which were much lower than those acquired under shorter GCI and IGCT (Figs. 2–4). However, the yields of 1,3-PD were substantially increased, with the average yields 0.55 mol/mol glycerolconsumed (Fig. 5). These results confirmed the hypothesis that longer HyRT increased the hydrogen absorption in fermentation solution, which inhibited hydrogen production, but enhanced the 1,3-PD production. In addition, it should be noted that the lag time for hydrogen production was 20 ± 5 h at the GCI of 2.5–8.5 h and the ICGT of 15 h, which was consistent with previous study [12]. When GCI and IGCT were further increased to 20 h and 65 h, respectively, except hydrogen yield and 1,3-PD yield, other liquid products yields were below 0.1 mol/mol glycerolconsumed (Fig. 6), which were lower than those at the GCI of 13 h and IGCT of 45 h (Fig. 5). The average hydrogen yield of P2 glycerol remained the same, while the average hydrogen yield of P3 glycerol (0.22 mol/mol glycerolconsumed, Fig. 6) was a bit higher than in previous condition (0.19 mol/mol glycerolconsumed, Fig. 5). This indicated that GCI/IGCT longer than 13/45 h would not have significant influence on hydrogen yields. The average 1,3-PD yield for P2 glycerol increased to 0.52 mol/mol glycerolconsumed at the GCI 20 h and IGCT 65 h (Fig. 6), which was slightly higher than that (Fig. 5). However, the average 1,3-PD yield for P3 glycerol became lower (0.57 mol/mol glycerolconsumed, Fig. 6) than that at the GCI 13 h and IGCT 45 h (0.60 mol/mol glycerolconsumed, Fig. 5). The highest 1,3-PD yield was 0.65 mol/mol glycerolconsumed produced by 7 g/L P3 glycerol. This is the highest 1,3-PD yield ever reported in anaerobic fermentation of glycerol. To conclusively demonstrate the changing trends of 1,3-PD and H2 yields when increasing GCI/IGCTs, the p values were acquired (to define the value differences between groups as Boolean type) based on the yields of 1,3-PD and H2 from each GCI/IGCT group, regardless of the glycerol types and concentrations. The p values for describing the increasing trend of 1,3-PD yields and the decreasing trend of H2 yields were 0.05 and 0.12, respectively, which showed that both trends were significant, even though the latter was slightly less considerable but still to an adequate extent."
8,"Effects of glycerol concentrations, GCI and IGCT on glycerol degradation efficiency","3.2 Effects of glycerol concentrations, GCI and IGCT on glycerol degradation efficiency The anaerobic fermentation had high removal efficiencies for P2 (Fig. 7a) and P3 glycerol (Fig. 7b). More than 90% (by mass) P2 and P3 glycerol was consumed in the batch tests at all the ranges of GCI (2.5–20 h), IGCT (15–65 h) and glycerol concentrations (3–7 g/L). However, one exception occurred at the P3 glycerol concentration of 7 g/L with the longest GCI and IGCT (GCI: 20 h and IGCT: 65 h) (Fig. 7b), which only 85% glycerol was degraded at the end of the operation. This exception might be caused by the low fermentation efficiency under long HyRT that may slow down the overall metabolic activities of anaerobic microorganisms. Moreover, higher removal efficiencies achieved at lower glycerol concentrations, and the GCI and IGCT had no obvious effect on glycerol degradation efficiency. P2 and P3 glycerol exhibited the similar removal efficiencies (90–100%). The results indicated that the anaerobic fermentation of glycerol from biodiesel waste stream had high removal efficiency. The maximum total fermentation time (h) for different glycerol types (P2 and P3) and different concentrations at each GCI/IGCT was examined (Fig. 8 ). It indicated that shorter GCI/IGCT generally had shorter fermentation duration. With prolonging the GCI/IGCT, the maximum total fermentation time increased and the longer HyRT slowed down the fermentation, which was corresponded with the lower production of hydrogen and liquid products (except 1,3-PD) at longer HyRT."
9,The pH variation during anaerobic fermentation,"3.3 The pH variation during anaerobic fermentation The protons (H+) generated throughout anaerobic fermentation reactions lowered the solution pH for both P2 (Fig. 9a) and P3 glycerol (Fig. 9b). Generally, higher glycerol concentrations resulted in higher amounts of liquid fermentation products (e.g. acetic acid, butyric acid) and the lower pH [30]. The results well corresponded with this trend of lower pH at higher glycerol concentrations, with two exceptions (GCI: 2.5 h and 20 h) for P2 glycerol (Fig. 9a). With the initial pH of 5.50 in all tests, the final pH ranged from 4.88 to 5.20. It should be noted that the low pH (below 5.20) (Fig. 9b) could also reduce the fermentation activities, which explained the glycerol degradation efficiency decreased at high glycerol concentrations (7 g/L P3) (Fig. 7b)."
10,Effects of fresh soil and old soil on fermentation,"3.4 Effects of fresh soil and old soil on fermentation Fresh soil (stored at 4 °C for less than 1 month) was used in all the experiments. To examine the effects of soil freshness on anaerobic fermentation, old soil (collected and stored at 4 °C for 6 months) was used as inocula and compared with fresh soil. Pure glycerol was used as organic substrate in these tests. The GCI of 10 h and IGCT of 25 h were applied. The results showed that average hydrogen yields of the fresh soil was 0.38 mol/mol glycerolconsumed and dropped to 0.31 mol/mol glycerolconsumed for old soil (Fig. 10 ). This trend was followed for all three glycerol concentrations (3, 5 and 7 g/L). The 1,3-PD yield was 0.44 mol/mol glycerolconsumed for fresh soil and 0.49 mol/mol glycerolconsumed for old soil. It should be noted that old soil had an average acetate yield of 0.15 mol/mol glycerolconsumed without ethanol yield (except 5 g/L glycerol), while fresh soil had an average ethanol yield of 0.15 mol/mol glycerolconsumed (except 3 g/L glycerol) without acetate production (Fig. 10). This might imply that the microbial communities changed through the 6-month soil storage period. Overall, the results indicated that fresh soil had better performances on hydrogen yield but lower 1,3-PD yield than old soil."
11,"Effects of GCI/IGCT on the net change of hydrogen and 1,3-PD yields","3.5 Effects of GCI/IGCT on the net change of hydrogen and 1,3-PD yields To elucidate the relationship of hydrogen yield and 1,3-PD yield for P2 (Fig. 11a) and P3 glycerol (Fig. 11b) at different GCIs and IGCTs, the net changes of these two major products were calculated with the yields at the shortest GCI and IGCT (GCI: 2.5 h and IGCT 15 h) as the baseline. It was clearly shown that the 1,3-PD yields enhanced at longer GCI/IGCT (h/h). For P2 glycerol, the 1,3-PD yield only had a small increase (net increase: 0.07 mol/mol glycerolconsumed) when GCI was increased from 2.5 to 5.5 h. Later, it substantially increased 0.32 mol/mol glycerolconsumed when GCI was further increased from 5.5 to 8.5 h. The net increase of 1,3-PD reached a plateau when GCI was increased to 13 and 20 h. P3 glycerol followed the same trend on the net changes of 1,3-PD at different GCIs/IGCTs. On the other hand, the net changes of hydrogen yields exhibited the opposite pattern compared with 1,3-PD (Fig. 11). Hydrogen yield was the highest at the shortest GCI/IGCT, and then steadily decreased with the increase in GCI/IGCT (h/h). For P2 glycerol, the hydrogen yield slightly decreased (−0.03 mol/mol glycerolconsumed) when GCI was increased to 5.5 h, then decreased considerably (−0.35 mol/mol glycerolconsumed) when GCI was increased to 8.5 h, and further deceased slowly when GCI was increased to 13 and 20 h. P3 glycerol fermentation followed the similar pattern. The net changes of hydrogen yields and 1,3-PD yields with GCI/IGCT (h/h) demonstrated that adjusting the gas collection time could change HyRTs in the anaerobic bioreactors and further influence the metabolic pathways of the fermentation. The optimization of hydrogen yield and 1,3-PD yield should be balanced at different GCIs and IGCTs."
12,"Kinetic models for hydrogen and 1,3-PD yields at different GCI/IGCTs","3.6 Kinetic models for hydrogen and 1,3-PD yields at different GCI/IGCTs There were only a few studies for modeling hydrogen and 1,3-PD yields in anaerobic treatment of glycerol, and most of them were based on glycerol concentrations. The model of hydrogen and liquid production from glycerol batch fermentation using activated municipal sludge as inoculum was developed [18]. By using the modified Gompertz equation, the best fittings of the obtained results were made for the evolved biogas (H2 and CO2) (R 2 > 0.9015), liquid products (including 1,3-PD) (R 2 > 0.9310) and glycerol (R 2 > 0.9676). Xiu et al. (2004) modeled the optimal conditions of batch and continuous glycerol fermentations by Klebsiella pneumoniae by setting volumetric productivity of 1,3-PD as the optimization target [31]. Sun et al. (2008) developed a metabolic kinetic model for simulating the concentrations of substrate (glycerol), key enzymes glycerol dehydratase (GDHt) and 1,3-PD oxidoreductase (PDOR), intermediate 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA), and target products (1,3-PD) [32]. By using Box-Behnken design and Response Surface Method (RSM), Varrone et al. (2012) effectively modeled the biohydrogen and ethanol production of glycerol fermentation process based on the parameter optimization of glycerol concentration, reaction temperature, and initial pH [33]. However, there has been no model to simulate the production of hydrogen and 1,3-PD at different gas collection frequencies (GCI/IGCT). This paper was, for the first time, to establish the mathematic correlation of hydrogen and 1,3-PD yields and GCI/IGCT for anaerobic treatment of glycerol. Based on the experimental results of H2 and 1,3-PD yields at different GCI/IGCT from P2 and P3 glycerol, two models were developed in this study to simulate the production of H2 and 1,3-PD at different GCI/IGCT, respectively. The software PYTHON (Python™, version 3.3.0) was used for the model development. Because the experimental results between P2 and P3 glycerol were similar, the average values of H2 and 1,3-PD were calculated and used to develop the models. Sum of squares errors (SSE) was applied to describe the preciseness of the models, which was a statistic approach to quantify the difference between the estimated implied values and the true values of the quantity being estimated. SSE is defined in Eq. (5) for a model with a single variable. (5) SSE = ∑ i = 1 n ( y i − f ( x i ) ) 2 where y i is the ith value of the variable to be predicted, x i is the ith value of the variable, and f(x i ) is the predicted value of y i . Two models were developed for the 1,3-PD (Eq. (6)) and H2 yields (Eq. (7)), respectively, with GCI and IGCT as variables. The model for the average 1,3-PD yields with GCI/IGCT is (6) Y 1 , 3 - PD = − 0.062 × GCI + 0.085 × IGCT + 0.012 × GCI 2 − 0.002 × IGCT 2 − 0.787 The model for the average H2 yields with GCI/IGCT is (7) Y H 2 = 0.064 × GCI − 0.080 × IGCT − 0.012 × GCI 2 − 0.002 × IGCT 2 − 0.787 where Y 1,3-PD and Y H 2 (mol/mol glycerolconsumed) are the average yields of 1,3-PD and H2 at different GCI/IGCT (h/h). The SSEs for the two models are 0.0093 and 0.0054, respectively, which indicated that these models precisely described the relationships between GCI/IGCT and the average H2 and 1,3-PD yields. The models clearly indicated that the mixed-order (1st order and 2nd order) GCI/IGCT directly influenced the H2 and 1,3-PD yields. The model provides a good guideline to estimate the H2 and 1,3-PD yields at different gas sampling frequencies (GCI/IGCT)."
13,Conclusion,"The effects of HyRT on the production of hydrogen and 1,3-PD in anaerobic fermentation of glycerol were extensively conducted in this study. Different concentrations of purified glycerol from biodiesel waste stream were tested as organic substrates. Different levels of CGI and IGCT were examined for the effects of different HPPs in headspace on anaerobic fermentation. The correlation of hydrogen production and 1,3-PD production was established. The effects of soil freshness on anaerobic fermentation were also investigated. There were five major conclusions drawn from this study. First, P2 and P3 glycerol exhibited similar performances on hydrogen and 1,3-PD yields. In addition, glycerol concentration was not a critical factor for hydrogen and 1,3-PD yields at low concentrations (<7 g/L). Higher methanol concentrations in P0 and P1 glycerol inhibited the growth of anaerobic bacteria and had low 1,3-PD yields. Second, hydrogen yield increased at shorter HyRT (shorter CGI and IGCT), while 1,3-PD yield decreased at shorter HyRT. The P3 glycerol at the concentration of 7 g/L had the highest 1,3-PD yield (0.65 mol/mol glycerolconsumed) at the GCI/IGCT (20 h/65 h) and the highest hydrogen yield (0.75 mol/mol glycerolconsumed) at the GCI/IGCT (2.5 h/20 h), respectively. Third, hydrogen yields from the old organic soil (stored for 6 months) as inoculum was lower than those from fresh soil (stored for 1 month), but 1,3-PD yields of these two types of soil were similar. Fourth, the mixed-order relationship of GCI/IGCT and the production of H2 and 1,3-PD was established in two models. Fifth, the optimization of hydrogen production and 1,3-PD production can be achieved by adjusting HyRT in anaerobic fermentation of biodiesel glycerol."
