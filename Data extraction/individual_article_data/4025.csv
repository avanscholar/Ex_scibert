0,Introduction,"The hydrogen (H2) economy has become a substantial fraction of the daily energy consumption demand in many countries, predominantly in the USA, Japan, Korea, and European countries. Development of infrastructure for hydrogen transportation and storage is the largest challenge for accelerating the commercialization of hydrogen economy. Blending H2 into existing natural gas pipeline systems has been considered a cost-effective method to deliver H2 from the original production site to the consumption region [1-3]. For many years, the primary concern of onshore transportation has increased the transportation efficiency by enhancing the capacity of the operating pressure and reducing the wall thickness of pipeline components. However, H2-related degradation remains a critical challenge for assuring the integrity of the H2 structural component [4-9]. Any introduction of H2 to a natural gas systems, even in very small concentrations, may require a serious modification to the design and maintenance of the structural materials [10,11]. According to the conventional design criteria for a pressure vessel component, the application of high-strength steel is the most effective method to increase the operating pressure and reduce the thickness of the vessel component. However, empirical results have demonstrated that higher-strength materials generally compromise greater resistance to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) as compared to lower-grade materials [12-15]. For example, comparing the HE susceptibility among three materials, namely, X52, X60, and X100, under high-pressure H2, Naninga et al. reported that the X100 pipeline is more sensitive to HE [13]. In a similar study, Hadie obtained a similar tendency of HE susceptibility among X60, X80, and X100 when conducted with the electrochemical charging method [14]. Therefore, a crucial concern for the material manufacturer is the right balance between safety and economic requirements. Most international piping system design standards still recommend the use of lower strength steel grades, such as X42 and X52 in H2-containing services [16,17]. To control the risk and ensure reliability, the mechanical performance of the pipeline material under various environmental conditions of the H2 blend should be investigated carefully. Generally, the higher strength and toughness of materials in this group of materials is normally attributed to the higher concentration of micro-alloying elements, lower carbon content, and thermomechanical processing conditions [18-20]. Even though these parameters are interdependent, thermomechanical processing often imparts the largest contribution to the final microstructural characteristics of the materials, and consequently plays a key role in the mechanical performances and resistance to hydrogen environment embrittlement (HEE) susceptibility of materials. A variety of pipeline steel microstructural phases, such as martensite, ferritic pearlite, acicular ferrite, tempered bainite, or tempered martensite, and their susceptibility to hydrogen damage have been reported in the literature [5,8,13,14,21-24]. The banded microstructural phases, such as ferrite/pearlite bands, are a common structural phase in low-strength pipeline steel grades, such as X42, X52, X60, and X65, while higher strength material grades, such as X80, X100, and X120, are mainly composed of acicular ferrite and bainitic ferrite phases. To achieve the desired strength and toughness as well as the HE resistance, specific microstructural phases or mixtures of these phases are often optimized. Many researchers have investigated the role of microstructural phases in the H2-assisted degradation of pipeline materials. For example, Stalheim et al. reported that materials composed of 90% polygonal ferrite and 10% acicular ferrite present the best HEE resistance properties than those containing 100% polygonal ferrite, or 92% polygonal ferrite and 8% upper bainite [25]. Tempered martensite was found to be more susceptible to HE than pearlitic steel [26]. The acicular ferrite and bainitic ferrite structure presents the best properties to HE resistance owing to its randomly oriented grain boundaries and high toughness, impeding crack propagation [27,28]. The morphological anisotropy existent in microstructural banding, such as between the ferrite and pearlite phases, is more prone to H2 damage, such as H2-induced cracking [5,21,29,30]. By conducting permeation tests, Park et al. emphasized that the bainite phase can trap H2 more efficiently than acicular ferrite and degenerated pearlite, resulting in greater HE susceptibility [27]. It can be seen that the microstructure dependency of HEE susceptibility are not always consistent with the strength grade of the materials when exposed to HE, as mentioned in the earlier introduction in References [13,14]. Much contradiction of which microstructural phases are more susceptible to H2-related degradation mechanisms still exists. To accurately reflect the performance of the actual structures, mechanical testing conditions should resemble the actual operating conditions. Different methodologies for evaluating the H2 compatibility of materials have been developed. The most applied technique is the uniaxial tensile test performed under a very slow strain rate condition, the so-called slow strain rate tensile test (SSRT). The H2 source can be introduced into the test specimens by either using pre-charged specimens or simultaneously performing the test during H2 charging. However, a large amount of material is often required to machine the standard specimen. In certain situations, the conventional test methods are unable to fulfill this task because of the destruction of the in-service component when the machine is used for the tested specimens. Therefore, the use of miniaturized specimens to assess the mechanical properties of materials is becoming popular, especially when there are volume constraints limiting the dimensions of the test samples. The small punch (SP) test is considered as the most promising and effective method to assess the degradation of the mechanical properties of materials [31-34]. The main advantage of this test method is that the testing samples can be taken from the structural component without impairing its structural integrity due to the size of the specimen. Compared to the conventional SSRT test, the installation and maintenance cost of the SP test is only 1/1000 ~ 1/10. The amount of hydrogen gas used in one-time test is less than 10 cc which is also significantly lower compared to that used in the conventional test method. Several research groups have applied the SP test in recent years to determine the H2 compatibility of materials. Hydrogen pre-charged specimens, pre-charged by introducing the H2 source into the specimen using electro-chemical charging methods, were mostly used for these tests [35-37]. Even though the SP test can provide a supportive screening technique for a quick evaluation/selection of the mechanical properties of materials, the use of the SP test results need to be interpreted with more research attention. The main objective of this study is to investigate and analyze the HEE susceptibility of API X42 pipeline steels under H2-natural gas mixtures with various fractions of H2 using SP tests. Based on the change in fracture characteristics against the H2 concentration, detailed metallurgical analyses were conducted on the post-rupture specimen to investigate the relationship between the microstructural characteristics, deformation process, and mechanism of H2-assisted cracking. Because the test method used a miniature specimen, the study also discusses the feasibility and the compatibility of the obtained results relative to conventional results."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,Specimen preparation and test environment,"2.1 Specimen preparation and test environment The material used in this study was API X42 pipeline steel, which has been widely used in existing gas pipelines. Table 1 presents the typical chemical compositions of this steel. Square 10 mm × 10 mm specimens with a thickness of 0.5 mm which is the most commonly used specimen were machined using a wire electro-discharge machine. The microstructural characteristics of the material were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Metallographic samples were mechanically ground, polished, and subsequently etched with a 2% nital etchant. Before conducting the experiment, each specimen was mechanically ground using grit papers on both sides to diminish the surface roughness effects. The thickness tolerance was controlled to below ± 0.005 mm. The H2/natural mixture gas environments were simulated by a methane/H2 gas mixture. The fraction of H2 in the gas mixture environment was varied as 0.1, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 vol%. All tests were performed at room temperature (25 °C) under three pressure levels of the natural gas pipeline systems (5, 7, and 10 MPa). After pressurizing to the desired pressure, the system was held for 0.5 h before testing. Additionally, a series of tests was conducted in ambient air and at 10 MPa (100% H2) for comparison. To investigate the effect of the exposure time on the H2 environment, the testing samples were artificially pre-exposed to 10 MPa of 100% H2 gas for 0.5, 24, and 120 h before conducting the tests. At least three tests were performed for each environmental condition. A summary of the environmental condition is provided in Table 2 ."
3,Test procedures,"2.2 Test procedures The setup of the SP test in a gas environment was conducted according to according to the CEN Code of Practice CWA 15,627 [38]. A typical assembly model of the SP jig test is schematically depicted in Fig. 1 a [39,40]. The test specimen was placed in the lower jig holder, which had a 4 mm diameter hole for the gas environment. The pressure was controlled by a pressure gauge mounted on the opposite side of the input gas gate. An O-ring was inserted in a groove machined in the lower die to present the gas leakage. Before inserting the O-ring, it was cleaned and covered with a high-pressure lubricant. The specimens were washed with an acetone or alcohol solution for 10 min in an ultrasonic cleaner to remove contaminants. The diameter of the compressive ball was 3 mm. After inserting the testing specimen in the lower jig holder, the upper and lower dies were fastened with a torque wrench to a constant torque of 1.5 Nm. After setting the SP jig, it was connected to the gas charging system. To ensure gas purity, a vacuum environment was created and nitrogen was purged at least three times before pressurizing to the desired testing pressure. After charging, the SP test kit was disconnected from the gas charging system, and the SP test apparatus was inserted into the universal material testing system with a maximal load capacity of 5 kN, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The punch displacement moved through a hole in the center of the upper die and pressed the compressive ball onto the specimen surface. During the test process, the load was applied to the specimen surface through the compressive ball. All tests were conducted at a constant punch displacement rate of 0.004 mm/min. A minimum of three tests were conducted for each environmental condition to verify the reproducibility of the results. The detailed fractography analyses of the post-rupture specimens were analyzed by SEM. Additionally, the cross-sectional metallurgical structure at the center part of the ruptured specimen was also analyzed. The specimens, cut along the middle, were mounted vertically in epoxy resin and were prepared for metallurgical analysis."
4,Results,
5,Microstructural characteristics,"3.1 Microstructural characteristics The typical API X42 steel microstructure consists of a mixture of ferrite and pearlite bands, with pearlite grains elongated in the rolling direction, as shown in Fig. 2 . The pearlitic volume fracture was approximately 20.5%. The grain size was irregular and the average ferritic grain size was approximately 16–21 µm as measured by the straight-line method with cut-off points. Additionally, inclusions of various sizes were also observed in the matrix, mainly at the ferrite and pearlite boundary, as depicted in Fig. 2(e). These inclusions were MnS inclusions, as determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. Previous studies have reported that inclusions are strong trapping sites for H2, resulting in the formation of H2-assisted crack initiation [8,26,27]."
6,Load–punch displacement curves,"3.2 Load–punch displacement curves Fig. 3 presents a comparison of the punch-displacement curves obtained under various environmental conditions at the three testing pressure levels. All curves can be schematically divided into four different regions that correspond to the different states of the deformation process during the SP test, as indicated in Fig. 3. Generally, region I is characterized by elastic bending deformation, while region II corresponds to the state of plastic bending. The most predominant region is region III, which is related to the membrane stretching process, while the final stage (region IV) corresponds to the formation of necking or microcracks, resulting in the final rupture of the sample. Regardless of the H2 concentration and pressure of the gas mixture, there were no notable differences in the initial portion of the data curves (region I), except for the curve performed in an ambient air environment. A clear distinction was only observed in the later deformation region of the curves, while the most pronounced differences were observed in regions III and IV. Under a higher H2 concentration, the strain-hardening and plastic instability processes (regions III-2 and IV-2, respectively) became shorter than that tested in ambient air or at a low H2 partial pressure (regions III-1 and IV-1, respectively) due to the effect of H2, leading to a decrease in the loading capacity and maximum load. The decrease in the load–displacement curves with an increasing H2 concentration is nearly consistent at all three testing pressure levels of the H2 gas mixture. Fig. 4 shows the effect of the hydrogen gas mixture pressure on the SP load–displacement curves obtained at a H2 concentration of 5%.The data curves are relatively consistent among the three pressure levels, with the exception that the elastic and plastic bending region at 10 MPa is slightly higher than that at a lower gas mixture pressure, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Fig. 5 (a–c) presents the representative load–punch displacement curves from the SP test with respect to the exposure time (0.5–120 h) at 10 MPa of 100% H2. The obtained load–displacement curves exhibited good reproducibility in each condition. A comparison of the typical data curves under three exposure time conditions is shown in Fig. 5(d). The curves are consistent at the three exposure times, indicating that the exposure time had a minor effect. Fig. 6 depicts the variation of the maximum load and displacement at failure against the H2 partial pressure. The H2 partial pressure was calculated according to each H2/natural mixture gas condition by multiplying the H2 concentration and the gas mixture pressure. The constructed curve representing the partial pressure dependency of the maximum load is schematically characterized by a transition curve with the distinct stages of an upper shelf, a transition region, and a lower shelf. The upper shelf corresponds to the results when the partial H2 pressure varied from 0.005 to 0.04 MPa. In the transition region, the maximal load drops dramatically from 0.04 (0.5 vol% H2 blend in a 7 MPa CH4/H2 gas mixture) to 0.3 MPa (3 vol% H2 blend in a 10 MPa CH4/H2 gas mixture) of the H2 partial pressure. A similar curve was constructed by using the displacements at the onset failure as a function of the H2 partial pressure, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Fig. 7 depicts the variation in SP absorption energy, ESP , with the H2 partial pressure. The ESP is defined as the area under the punch load–displacement curve until the maximum load point was reached [38,40]. The constructed curves with the variations of H2 partial pressure based on the SP absorbed energy exhibit a similar configuration to the maximal load against the H2 partial-pressure curves (depicted in Fig. 6(a)) and the displacement at failure against the H2 partial-pressure curves (in Fig. 6(b)). The upper shelf is located at an SP absorbed energy of 2.4 J while the stable SP energy level at the low shelf is approximately 0.75 J. Table 3 summarizes the characteristic parameters of the constructed curve."
7,Fracture morphologies,"3.3 Fracture morphologies Fig. 8 shows the macroscopic and microscopic fractographic morphologies of the rupture specimens under various environmental conditions. The macroscopic fracture appearance of all the ruptured specimens revealed a hemispherical cup shape. The final rupture was caused by a pronounced circumferential crack, originating from the bottom surface of the specimen. In contrast, the micro-fracture morphology was significantly altered with a variation in the H2 concentration. As presented in Fig. 8(a and b), the samples tested in ambient air and under a low partial H2 pressure of up to 0.5% H2 presented a ductile fracture surface with dimples, due to the nucleation and coalescence of microvoids. In contrast, a high density of circumferential surface cracks was observed away from the center of the lower surface of the specimens when the H2 concentration increased. In particular, the fracture surface of the specimen tested under a 1% H2 – 7 MPa gas mixture exhibited a mixed-mode fracture of micro-void coalescence and quasi-cleavage cracking (Fig. 8(c)), however, the ductile fracture mode is still the predominant fracture mode under these conditions. When the H2 concentration in the blending gas was increased to 5%, the fracture surface was characterized completely by a faceted texture of quasi-cleavage planes. Additionally, the lower surface of the ruptured specimen exhibited a high density of secondary circumferential cracks surrounding the main crack (Fig. 8(d)). The fracture surface appearance of the specimens tested at 10 MPa H2 (Fig. 8(e)) was nearly identical to those tested in gas mixture conditions with 5% H2, except for the higher density of secondary circumferential cracks on the ruptured specimens tested at 10 MPa H2."
8,Discussion,
9,Correlation between SP and conventional test results in evaluating HEE compatibility,"4.1 Correlation between SP and conventional test results in evaluating HEE compatibility Generally, the inherent mechanical properties of materials that are obtained through conventional tensile tests, such as yield strength (σy ) and ultimate tensile strength (σust ), cannot be directly obtained from the SP test results. Instead, the primary parameters representing each deformation region, such as yield load in the elastic deformation region, Py , maximum load, Pmax , and displacement at failure, Uf , are often evaluated from the obtained load–punch displacement curves. Thereafter, these parameters are used to evaluate some empirical correlations between the mechanical properties by using the conventional test method and the characteristic parameter. In particular, the most well-known empirical correlations for determining the actual yield stress and tensile strength of materials from the SP test results are expressed as σy = α1Py/t2 + α2 and σUTS = β1Pmax/t2 + β2 , respectively, where t is the thickness of the SP specimen,αi=1,2 and βi=1,2 are correlation parameters that depend on the individual materials and the geometric parameters of the SP jig, such as the ball and hole diameters of the lower die [41-43]. They are not calculated directly from the geometric parameters of the equipment but are often derived from regression methods based on the experimental results comparison between the two test methods. According to the comparison of the punch-displacement characteristics, the yield-loads of the elastic bending deformation regions (Region I) revealed no significant differences among the test environments. The slightly higher value of the elastic yield load at higher pressure levels, as shown in Fig. 4(b), was attributed to the effect of the testing pressure on the geometric stiffness of the specimens. Therefore, the calculated yield stress value from the SP test results may also not be affected by H2. This is consistent with the results obtained by the conventional test method, which reported an insignificant effect of H2 on the yield strength of materials. However, the remarkable decrease in the maximum load with an increasing H2 concentration indicates that the evaluated tensile strength of the materials is significantly affected by the H2 concentration. These results significantly differ from the results of the conventional tensile test because the ultimate tensile strength is often not affected by the gaseous H2 environment [10,11,13,44,45]. The large HEE susceptibility difference between the two test methods can be attributed to the distinction in the deformation mechanism during the test process. The loading condition in the SP test is a highly biaxial stress state, which is more severe than the uniaxial loading in the conventional test method. According to establish a quantitative correlation between SP and conventional test results, Altstadt et al. also emphasized that it is better correlated the ultimate tensile strength (σust ) of materials with the loading value corresponding to the onset of plastic instability, rather than the maximum load of the load–punch displacement curves [41]. It also has been reported that the results from notched tensile test specimens exhibited some opposite trends to the SSRT. Wang et al. found a reduction trend in the maximum stress of notched-tensile specimens when the H2 concentration was varied [22]. Meng et al. also emphasized that while the ultimate strength of X80 pipeline steel was consistent at all the various conditions of the H2/N2 mixture, the maximum notched stress decreases with an increasing H2 concentration in the mixture gas [46]. Therefore, the notched tensile specimen results arguably correlate with the SP results. The reduced maximum tensile strength is often attributed to the occurrence of premature failure, such as microcracks, before reaching the ultimate tensile strength point. The high stress/strain concentration at the notch tip creates a highly localized H2 concentration and the early onset of a critical state for H2-assisted cracking. Therefore, it is feasible that the significant reduction in the maximum load is also caused by the formation of premature crack initiation during plastic bending and the sample stretching processes."
10,Hydrogen concentration dependency of H2-assisted cracking,"4.2 Hydrogen concentration dependency of H2-assisted cracking A general perception is that the migration of H2 atoms into the bulk material and, consequently, its interaction with the crystal structure is the basis of H2-related degradation. Successful crack initiation may also depend on whether the subjected strain exceeds the critical strain of the materials that are often degraded by H2 [47,48]. The consequent change in the deformation behavior with H2 concentration/H2 partial-pressure may be correlated to the H2 partial pressure/concentration dependency of the H2 diffusion rate during the SP testing. To explain the difference in the micro-fracture mechanism at different H2 concentrations, a detailed fractographic analysis was conducted on the ruptured specimens. To more clearly investigate the damage evolution during the SP test process, the microstructure at a region close to the necking and failure location was examined in more detail. Fig. 9 presents the cross-sectional microstructure of a ruptured specimen under ambient air corresponding to the upper limit of the constructed maximum load against the H2 partial pressure curve or the SP energy against the H2 partial pressure curve. As presented in Fig. 9(a), the specimen tested in ambient air and under a low partial H2 pressure showed a notable decrease in thickness, which could be attributed to extensive plastic deformation before failure. The microstructures, including both the ferrite and pearlite bands, were extensively elongated toward the rupture location and the fracture mechanism occurred by micro-void coalescence and localized shear deformation (Fig. 9(c and d). Therefore, it can be argued that low H2 concentrations, such as 0.1 or 0.5%, are too low for the diffusible H2 to accumulate in critical concentrations for crack initiation. Fig. 10 presents metallographic images obtained from the specimen tested under a 1% H2–7 MPa gas mixture, corresponding to the transition region of the constructed curve, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The mixture of plastic deformation and crack propagation may indicate that there is a competition between the two potentially active fracture mechanisms, namely, ductile and quasi-cleavage fracture. However, it appears that ductile fracture is still the dominant fracture mode under this condition. The presence of some shallow quasi-cleavage fractures can be attributed to the absorption of H2 on the thin surface layer on the bottom surface of the sample which may have reached the critical concentration for crack initiation. In contrast, the failure mechanism in the 100% H2–10 MPa specimen is a completely quasi-cleavage fracture and the number of crack initiations sites was dramatically increased, as shown in Fig. 11 . The grain structure exhibited similar characteristics to the original microstructure shown in Fi. 2. A slight reduction in thickness was observed and the micro-cracks mostly occurred and propagated along the ferrite and pearlite interface (Fig. 11(b–d). Interestingly, when the crack tip meets the pearlite band, the crack propagation path deflected from its original direction, as shown in Fig. 11(e and f). The higher H2 concentration/H2 partial pressure may enhance the H2 solubility and surface coverage to achieve the critical state of crack initiation [13]. The decrease in the maximum load under a high H2 concentration may be attributed to the premature formation of micro-cracks and crack propagation, resulting in a reduced specimen thickness and load bearing capacity. According to the Code of Practice CWA 15,627 [38], another possibility of the SP test is that it can be used to estimate fracture toughness of materials in which an equivalent fracture strain (ε f ) was measured and empirically correlated with fracture toughness. The equivalent fracture strain (εf ) is defined as εf = ln (to/tf) where to and tf are the initial and final thickness of the specimen, respectively. It is clearly observed that the specimen tested in ambient air and under a low partial H2 pressure showed a notable decrease in thickness while it is almost unchanged when tested at a high concentration of H2 gas, as shown in Figs. 9-11. It is concluded that the fracture toughness of the X42 pipeline steel tested in a high hydrogen concentration was also decreased remarkably compared to those obtained in ambient air and low concentration of hydrogen. The applicability of the SP test to evaluate the ductile brittle transition temperature (DBTT) has been widely used in the literature [43,49-51]. The theory is based on the temperature dependency of the SP absorbed energy accompanying the change in fracture modes with temperature. The available evidence demonstrates that brittle crack initiation often nucleates at the center part of the SP specimens and propagates along the radial direction in the brittle lower shelf range, while failure in the ductile locating at the upper shelf range above the DBTT occurs along the circumferential edge. A mix of ductile and brittle fractures are simultaneously observed in the transition DBTT region. As presented in Fig. 7, the macroscopic characterization of the constructed curve of the absorbed SP energy against the H2 partial pressure clearly shows similarity to the DBTT obtained by the SP test, in which the lower shelf under high H2 concentrations corresponds to the data range at low temperatures. Fig. 12 presents a summary of the H2 partial pressure dependency of the SP absorbed energy accompanying the ductile to brittle transition of the macroscopic fracture appearance. Similar to the DBTT curve, the determination of the H2 partial pressure/concentration at the transition region and the starting pressure values of the low shelf may attract the most significant attraction. From the constructed curve, it is possible to evaluate the transition partial pressure (0.05 MPa) and the H2 partial pressure value at the stable state in the low shelf (0.5 MPa). The partial pressure of H2 at 0.5 MPa in the stable state in the lower shelf may correspond to the saturated pressure of the HEE. The HEE susceptibility, which is represented by the quantitative value in the SP test, occurs at a significantly lower pressure than the corresponding conventional tensile test. In particular, Stalheim et al. conducted the SSRT and discovered that no significant further reduction in ductility of various commercial-grade API pipeline materials was observed beyond a H2 pressure of 5.5 MPa [25]. According to Xu et al., the HE susceptibility of carbon and low-alloy steels may reach a saturated state at a H2 pressure of 6.9 MPa [57]. These pressure levels are remarkably higher than the saturation value in the SP test, as discussed above. Even though the transition from ductile to brittle failure in steels as a result of hydrogen is still not sufficiently explored by the conventional test method, it can be argued that the transition pressure determined by the conventional test methods is also higher than the value obtained by the SP test, which is similar to the correlation of the transition partial pressure obtained by the two test methods. Therefore, the insignificant effect of the exposure time on the SP test results, as shown in Fig. 5, could be so because the HEE susceptibility of the material used in this study had already reached a saturated state at 10 MPa of H2. Therefore, no further degradation occurred even though the specimen was pre-exposed to 10 MPa of H2 for 120 h. It was noted that the DBTT obtained from SP testing also exhibited a significantly lower value than the results obtained from conventional Charpy testing [49,50,52]. The discrepancy between the saturated H2 pressure obtained from the SSRT and from SP testing was attributed to the difference in the stress state and the effect of the specimen dimensions. As previously discussed, the stress state in the SP test is severely bi-axial, while monotonic loading is the dominant stress state in the SSRT testing."
11,Deformation process affecting H2-assisted crack initiation,"4.3 Deformation process affecting H2-assisted crack initiation As previously indicated, increasing the H2 concentration in the mixture gas changed the fracture behavior from ductile to brittle, which is similar to the effect of temperature or loading rate on the fracture mode of materials. However, there are also several important differences when comparing the mechanisms of H2-enhanced brittle fracture and low temperature-enhanced fracture. A common temperature-enhanced brittle fracture feature is that the crack initiation mainly occurs at the center of the SP specimen, as revealed by the star-shaped cracks in the completely brittle fracture modes [53,54]. In contrast, the fracture surface and cross section of the ruptured specimen revealed that the H2 concentration-assisted brittle fracture on the SP specimen mainly occurred away from its center with no cracks observed in the central area, as shown in Fig. 6(d). The time-dependency of the process is a probable explanation attributed to the H2-induced brittle fracture during the SP test with simultaneous H2 charging, while the temperature-assisted brittle fracture state is already established from the beginning of the test. It is well known that the concentration of H2 uptake is proportional to the external stress application. In contrast, the primary step of H2-enhanced brittle fracture is related to the H2 uptake from the gas environment to the high stress concentration location. As highlighted by the finite element analysis results in the literature, the maximum stress location radially propagates outward from the center of the specimen with an increasing displacement [55,56]. At the beginning of the test, a high stress concentration may appear in the lower surface at the center of the specimen owing to the small contact area between the compressive ball and specimen surface. Since the exposure time to a H2-containing environment is very short, the amount of H2 uptake in the material layer is significantly smaller than the critical values for enhancing crack initiation. As the testing time increased, the amount of diffused H2 increased significantly due to the longer exposure to the environment containing H2. Simultaneously, the specimen deformed continuously, and the increasing punch displacement was accompanied by the movement of the maximum stress location outward during the plastic bending and sample stretching process. Once the accumulated concentration of H2 at the maximum-stress location reached a critical value, it resulted in the nucleation of the circumferential crack. It is worth mentioning that a higher H2 concentration may enhance the H2 diffusion rate. Therefore, crack initiation can start earlier at higher H2 concentrations, causing a reduction in the radius of the circular crack, as shown in Fig. 8(d and e). In contrast, when the tests were conducted with the H2 pre-charged specimen, the critical state of H2-related degradation was already established from the beginning of the test. In this situation, the H2-assisted crack initiation can occur at the center of the SP specimen, which is similar to the crack initiation behavior at severe low temperatures [36]."
12,Microstructure banding affecting H2-assisted crack initiation,"4.4 Microstructure banding affecting H2-assisted crack initiation It has commonly been assumed that H2 environmental-assisted crack initiation can successfully initiate due to the coexistence of a critical state of H2 concentration and the stress/strain condition in a susceptible material. The amount of accumulated H2 is controlled by the efficiency of the H2 diffusion process into the material layer so that the location serving as a high H2 diffusion path would lead to the formation of localized plastic deformation, designated as the H2-localized plastic deformation (HELP) zone [57,58]. As shown in Fig. 11, it is evident that the microcrack predominantly nucleated along the interface of the ferrite and pearlite bands when tested at a H2 partial pressure of 10 MPa. It is probable that this location would be a preferred site for H2-assisted crack initiation. The crack propagation path changed with time, as depicted in the vicinity of the crack tip in Fig. 11(e and d). To correlate the microstructural features to the initiation site and propagation behavior of the H2-assisted crack initiation, attention should be paid to the heterogeneous structure characteristics, such as the mechanical properties (strength and hardness) and H2 trapping efficiency of each crystal structure. Fig. 13 presents the Vickers microhardness measurements taken along the revealed microstructure band. The microhardness of the pearlite ranged from 255 to 270 HV, which is significantly higher than that of ferrite (150–160 HV). The significantly superior microhardness of pearlite is because pearlite is a very fine-grained mixture of ferrite and cementite (iron carbide) while ferrite is a crystal structure of carbon in body-centered cubic iron. From a mechanical perspective, the presence of ferrite/pearlite bands may cause directionality in mechanical properties, such as stress/strain incompatibility, inducing localized deformation and directional crack propagation. Therefore, the strain localization at the interface may serve as a high H2 diffusion path. Subsequently, the H2 concentration at the ferrite/pearlite interface always reaches a critical concentration more readily than other locations, resulting in the early initiation of hydrogen embrittlement assisted cracking. Fig. 14 presents a schematic illustration of the hydrogen environmental-assisted crack (HEAC) initiation based on the revealed micro-fracture mechanism of the specimen tested under 10 MPa H2. Because the pearlite/ferrite interface with localized deformation acts as a high path for H2 diffusion, the early achievement of critical H2 concentration at this site may result in early crack initiation. When a crack has initiated successfully, the crack tip is directly exposed to the H2-containing environment. Therefore, crack propagation will continue to be accompanied by a quasi-cleavage facet due to HELP. Once the propagated cracks are relatively prevalent in the bulk material, the crack propagation process changes into an unstable propagation state, which is largely dependent on microstructural characteristics, such as grain size and grain orientation. Therefore, the deflected propagation path, as shown in Fig. 8d, e, can be explained by the presence of the high-strength and hardness of the pearlite phase in the metal matrix, acting as an obstacle which resists crack propagation and deflects the crack path direction. As previously mentioned, when conducting conventional test methods to evaluate the H2 compatibility of carbon and low-alloy steels, more pronounced results can be expected from the higher strength steels as they are more susceptible to HEE than the lower grades. Therefore, it is also interesting to compare the HEE susceptibility of the steel grade obtained by the SP test between the X42 pipeline steel (obtained in this study) with the higher strength grade materials, such as X70 pipeline steel [40]. The quantitative values in the upper and lower shelf of the SP absorbed energy against the H2 partial pressure curve of the API X70 grade were found to be higher than the corresponding values in the API X42 materials; however, the normalized Esp values obtained in the H2-containing environment were consistent with the Esp values obtained in ambient air. The specifications of the transition region are also consistent between the two materials, where the transition from ductile to brittle is approximately located at the H2 partial pressure value of 0.05 MPa. A pronounced distinction was only observed in the HEAC mechanism when tested at a high concentration of H2 gas. In particular, a high density of circumferential secondary cracks and a very complicated crack propagation path was observed on the rupture specimen of X42 steel, while the X70 specimen failure was visually caused by a unique circumferential surface crack. Thus, the difference in HE susceptibility between the two materials is insignificant. This result is in apparent contradiction to the results obtained in the SSRT, which has shown that the higher strength is at the expense of its HE resistance. Even the presence of microstructural inhomogeneity in the ferrite/pearlite band makes the X42 pipeline more prone to HE than the X70 grade. A possible explanation for this might be that the state of the HEAC mechanism is usually a synergistic action of several factors, such as the critical H2 concentration, stress conditions, and susceptible materials. In the SP test, the severe stress condition might be a dominant factor that relieves the effect of the microstructural characteristics. A similar result can be observed with the notched tensile test specimen or under fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth test conditions. Owing to the presence of a notch/crack, the high localized triaxial stress state that occurs at the crack tip may enhance local H2 solubility and promote the absorption of H2 into the sub-surface of the specimens [15,46]. Therefore, the effect of the stress state may dominate the effect of the microstructural features."
13,Conclusions,"This study investigated the effect of H2 concentrations in mixtures with natural gas on the mechanical properties and fracture behavior of X42 pipeline steel. The obtained results can be summarized as follows: (1) The influence of H2 on the quantitative parameters obtained in the SP test is manifested by the reduction of the maximum load, displacement at failure, and the transition of the fracture mode to a completely quasi-cleavage fracture. Generally, H2 had an insignificant effect on the elastic bending region but significantly reduced the plastic bending and membrane stretching processes during the SP test. (2) The effect of H2 concentration on the fracture behavior during SP tests was demonstrated by a transition from ductile to brittle fracture, which is similar to the temperature-assisted brittle fracture phenomenon. However, the transition region and saturated state of the HEE susceptibility occurred at a significantly lower H2 pressure than that assessed by conventional SSRT. (3) The HE susceptibility of the API X42 pipeline steel concluded as a synergic interaction between hydrogen concentration/partial pressure and microstructural characteristics. The micro-mechanisms responsible for the enhanced HEE susceptibility are closely correlated to the detrimental site induced by the microstructural band in the metal matrix. Hydrogen-assisted crack initiation mainly occurred and propagated along the ferrite/pearlite interface. The stress/strain localization induced along the grain boundaries between the two different ferrite/pearlite phases attract more H2 diffusion and result in a high local H2 concentration. (4) The correlation between the HEE susceptibility of the material obtained by the SP test and the conventional test method was discussed. The results obtained in the SP test can reproduce the same micro-mechanisms occurring during notched tensile tests, while the HEE grades are more severe than those obtained with smooth tensile specimens. This was attributed to the specimen geometry, complicated deformation process, and severe biaxial stress concentration conditions at the bottom surface, which can enhance the H2 diffusion."
