0,Introduction,"The palm oil sector in Malaysia is showing positive exponential growth covering 33.7% of total palm oil exports due to the availability of land for the cultivation of palm trees [1]. The palm oil export covers more than 5% of Malaysia Gross Domestic Product (GDP) [2]. It is the second-biggest palm oil supplier to the world after Indonesia. One ton of palm oil produced from fresh fruit brunches (FFB), produces 240 L of palm oil mill effluent (POME) [3,4]. POME is disposed off to the open ponds after pre-treatment due to which its quantity in Malaysia is increasing every year. More than 10 million tons of POME is produced in the palm oil industries per annum [5]. It is a colloidal suspension containing 95–96% of water, 0.6–0.7% of residual palm oil, and 4–5% of total solids including 2–4% of suspended solids [4,6]. The palm oil mill processing an average of 30 tons FFB/h generates approximately 20 tons/h of POME [7]. The best solution to get rid of the problems associated with POME is to use it for biodiesel production. The assessment of POME for biodiesel production is vital. The percentage of oil and oil recovery yield are the two important parameters to produce a high quality of biodiesel [8]. Therefore, the optimization of parameters to extract maximum oil for biodiesel production is necessary to make the process cost-effective. Several innovative processes have been applied by palm oil mills to treat POME using aerobic and anaerobic digestion [9,10]. The biological process treatment system needs continuous monitoring and proper time to time maintenance [11]. The performance of microorganisms is strongly affected by the changes in the environment [12]. Therefore, a great attention is needed to ensure the conductive for proper handling of microorganisms or enzymes [8,13]. The biological treatment produces a vast amount of biogas which mainly contains methane, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide [14,15]. The emission of these gases causes ozone depletion, water, and land pollution due to its corrosive and odorous nature [14,16]. The processing of POME on the treatment plant produces biogas and hence, not focusing on recovery of the residual palm oil as well as water. The effluent is directly discharged into the open ponds and drainage system which is harmful for the environment and aquatic life. Instead of biological process, the evaporation process is also suggested to be used to remove the water as POME contains 95% of water [17]. It can recover oil up to 98% recovery for seeds as well as the waste oils like POME [18,19]. Therefore, POME can be used for biodiesel synthesis instead of biogas due to its high oil content. The oil and grease content of POME is recovered using solvent extraction. Solvent extraction is the recovery of one part of the liquid component from the liquid itself using another liquid in which constituents are highly dissolvable. The solvent is introduced in the liquid that is soluble in one of the liquid components of the solution without undergoing a chemical change. The solvent is selected having a nature that can be easily recovered from the bulk of the liquid making its reusability and recovery easier [20]. There are four basic components involved in the recovery of oil from POME including mixing of POME and solvent, separation of extracted oil and solvent using layer separation, recovery of oil from the solvent, and recovery of the residual solvent from the wastewater for recycling of the solvent [21]. The solvent extraction has wide range of applications in the chemical industries to recover pure compounds including pharmaceutical, biomedical, analytical chemistry, wastewater purification, and in the research as well. The solvents are used in these industries in the reaction systems and processing steps as they contribute a significant role in the environmental, economic performance, and feasibility of the process [22]. Mainly, the process industry involves the use of green solvents due to the environmental pollution concerns as they are more advantageous over organic or aqueous solvents, improving the product separation. The most commonly used industrial solvents are ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvents, supercritical carbon dioxide, liquid polymers, and gas expanded solvents [23]. According to the principle of separation, separating funnel contains two layers of liquids containing the solvent. The one layer contains water and other impurities and another layer contains maximum oil and water [11]. Suwanno et al. [12] investigated the production of biodiesel from POME using crude lipase as a catalyst and achieved biodiesel yield of 92%. Manurang et al. [24] studied the biodiesel production using sludge palm oil via homogeneous-catalyzed transesterification. The operating conditions for transesterification reaction were kept as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) catalyst loading of 1 wt%, reaction temperature of 70 ℃, ethanol to oil molar ratio of 9:1, rate of mixing of 400 rpm, and reaction time of 1 h. The biodiesel yield of 83.19% was achieved at the optimized conditions. In another study, Hayyan et al. [25] reported the effect of alkali-catalyzed transesterification of residual oil extracted from palm oil mill waste. The operating conditions were kept; potassium hydroxide (KOH) loading of 1 wt%, reaction temperature of 60 ℃, mixing speed of 300 rpm, and reaction time of 60 min resulting in the optimized yield of 84.0% [25]. Mujtaba et al. [26] investigated the effect of KOH on the transesterification of residual palm oil using response surface methodology. The biodiesel yield was 96.61% under the optimized parameters of time (38.96 min), methanol to oil ratio (60 v/v%), and catalyst loading (0.70 wt%). The previous studies showed that the oil extraction from POME was taken place at the constant conditions of agitation speed, mixing time, and solvent to POME mass ratio. However, the optimization of parameters affecting the oil extraction yield has not been investigated before. This is the most important aspect of the biodiesel production studies utilizing the biological wastes like POME. Therefore, there is a dire need of such study to make the biodiesel synthesis, much productive and cost effective. To the best of our knowledge, the simulation and experimental study of biodiesel production using residual palm oil extracted at the optimized conditions has not been carried out before. Therefore, in the present study, four solvents were used including n-hexane, methanol, methanol, and toluene for the oil recovery to produce biodiesel. The effect of solvent ratio, mixing time, and agitation speed was investigated using each solvent to optimize the parameters giving a maximum yield of oil. The transesterification of the extracted residual palm oil was conducted using conventional heating in the presence of methanol and KOH as a catalyst. The operating parameters of the transesterification were optimized during the experimental study as well as batch reactor simulation model developed using Aspen plus. It is hypothesized that the extracted oil can prove to be the cheapest substrate for biodiesel synthesis."
1,Material and methods,"POME has a considerable effect on the environment since its physico-chemical properties are highly polluting due to its higher values of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), suspended solids, and oil and grease content [27,28]. COD was measured by adding 2 mL of POME with the solution of potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and mercury (Hg). 2 mL of distilled water in a reagent vial was taken as a blank sample. The sample and reagent are mixed and heated at 105 ℃ for 2 h for proper digestion. The sample was placed in the spectrophotometer for the proper measurement of the concentration of COD [29]. The composition of POME is shown in Table 1. The oil and grease content present in POME was approximately between 4000 and 8000 mg/L, these were very high as compared to the discharge limits set by the Malaysian Department of Environment of 50 mg/L [30]. Table 2 shows the allowable discharge limit of each parameter of POME. The allowable discharge limits indicate that it is necessary to extract the residual oil before its discharge into the open ponds. The extraction of oil was performed using n-hexane, methanol, ethanol, and toluene as an extraction solvent. The required chemicals were purchased from Merck and Sigma Aldrich, Malaysia. The POME sample was collected from Felcra Nasaruddin Palm Oil Mill located in Perak, Malaysia. The fresh POME having a temperature of 70–90 ℃ and 4–5 pH [14,31] was kept in the refrigerator for few hours to cool the sample before its usage in the extraction process."
2,Determination of water content,"2.1 Determination of water content POME being collected from a palm oil mill contains a huge quantity of water. The water present in the sample (POME) decreases the solubility of oil in the solvent used for oil extraction. Therefore, it is necessary to determine and remove the water content before using it for oil extraction. To determine the water content present in the POME, ASTM D95 method [32] was used. The specified volume of POME sample was taken in the beaker and placed in the oven at the temperature of 105 ℃ [17]. The total weight loss of the sample in a specified time was expressed as the total moisture content of the POME."
3,Determination of oil content,"2.2 Determination of oil content The equal proportion of POME was dissolved in toluene for 5 min. The solution layers were separated by centrifuge using 400 rpm speed for 30 min [33]. After complete mixing, the clear layers of solution were formed. The layers were allowed to settle in the separating funnel. The upper layer containing oil and toluene was heated, performing the distillation to remove the excess toluene present. The oil content was determined according to Eq. (1) [12]. (1) O i l c o n t e n t % = B − A C × 100 Where, B is the weight of the final sample, A is the weight of the empty centrifuge tube and C is the weight of the initial sample."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure 2.3.1 Recovery of oil from POME The extraction of oil using the solvents including n-hexane, methanol, ethanol, and toluene was carried out in the present work. The batch process was used to recover the oil as it is easier to handle and requires minimum energy. Similarly, the batch model was developed on the simulator for the sake of the same purpose. To extract the oil, a known amount of POME and solvent such as n-hexane was mixed in a beaker. The oil was soluble in the POME and hence, mixing caused to increase in the solubility of POME and solvent [12]. The solution of POME and solvent were centrifuged to separate the layers of solvent and oil. The solvent and oil layer was separated in the beaker and was placed in the drier to evaporate the solvent. The amount of extracted oil was weighed, and the percentage of oil recovery was calculated. The same procedure was repeated for all solvents including methanol, ethanol, and toluene to compare the oil extraction efficiency. The parameters varied for the extraction of oil were mixing time, agitation speed, and solvent to POME ratio. The centrifugation was used to recover the oil and solvent layer from the water layer. Oil and solvent were placed in the distillation flask to recover the pure solvent and oil. The boiling point of solvents is given in Table 3. The recovery of pure solvents and oil using distillation was done at the boiling points of solvents. The recovered solvents were recycled back to make the process cost-effective [34]. 2.3.2 Transesterification via conventional heating To investigate the optimum conditions for the use of KOH as a catalyst and methanol as a solvent on the transesterification of extracted oil from POME, the parameters affecting the biodiesel yield were varied in a specified range of methanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1–14:1, reaction temperature of 30–70 ℃, the reaction time of 1–3 h, constant catalyst loading of 1.5 wt%, and agitation speed of 500 rpm. The biodiesel yield was optimized following the range of specified reaction conditions. 2.3.3 Simulation study for biodiesel production The extracted oil from POME proves to be a prominent source of triglycerides for biodiesel production [35,36]. Therefore, the performance analysis of biodiesel synthesis using triglycerides extracted from POME was done on the Aspen Plus simulator. Process modeling, simulation, and optimization has great importance and plays a significant role to understand the reaction behavior of the transesterification process. For this purpose, a simple batch reactor has been simulated at the specified transesterification conditions. The transesterification process flow is presented in Fig. 1. The operating parameters including oil to alcohol molar ratio, reaction time, and reaction temperature were varied. A simple batch reactor (RBATCH) model was chosen to simulate the transesterification process to limit the number of unit operations involved in the process. Five components including methanol, triolein, KOH, methyl oleate, and glycerol were added to the Aspen plus components list. As, the system involves non-polar components including triolein, biodiesel, and glycerol due to which, non-random two liquid (NRTL) was chosen as a thermodynamic property package for the satisfactory calculation of material and energy balance of the system. The components included in the Aspen plus simulation system and their role in the transesterification are presented in Table 3. An NRTL method developed for methanol-triolein-KOH involves the following reaction Eq. (2). (2) Triglycerides + 3 C H 3 OH ⇌ 3 FAME + Glycerol For the rate-controlling step of transesterification, the general power-law expression used in the simulation as Eq. (3). (3) r = k T T o n exp − E R 1 T − 1 T o Where, r (min−1) is the rate of reaction; k (min−1) is the pre-exponential factor; n is the reaction temperature exponent; E (kJ/mol) is the activation energy of the transesterification reaction, R (kJ/mol K) is the general gas constant, T and T◦ (K) are absolute and reference temperatures, respectively. In Aspen plus process model, the methanol (solvent), and KOH (catalyst) were mixed in the mixer before introducing into the reactor. The heated oil (triolein) between (30–70 ℃) was introduced in a batch reactor. The reaction was taken place at the temperature of (30–70 ℃) and pressure of 1 atm. The reaction parameters affecting the biodiesel yield was optimized to obtain the highest yield of biodiesel synthesis."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Influence of parameters on oil extraction from POME,"3.1 Influence of parameters on oil extraction from POME The POME was pre-treated to remove the water before extracting the oil from POME. The amount of moisture present in the POME was determined at various time intervals to completely remove the water from POME. POME contains 95% water due to which its enormous quantity is required to process to obtain a significant biodiesel yield in the transesterification process. However, the removal of water decreased its overall volume as oil became the major component of its composition after evaporation. Therefore, this helped to decrease the volume of POME used for the extraction of oil. The moisture content of POME was determined by keeping its known quantity in the oven. The POME sample was placed for 100 min in the oven to determine the influence of time on the moisture removal of the POME. The effect of the variance of time on the moisture content of POME is presented in Fig. 2. The use of water in the production of palm oil from FFB is huge and water is majorly used in the condensers, reboilers, and distillation columns. Therefore, it can be observed from Fig. 2, the weight of the total sample was decreased with the increase of evaporation time. There was no change in the total solution weight of the sample placed for 80 and 100 min evaporation time because the evaporation was already reached to the steady-state value. The steady-state value of the moisture content of POME was found to be 93.5% after 80 min. After water removal from POME, the remaining solution was processed to extract the oil to investigate the different parameters affecting the oil recovery yield. 3.1.1 Effect of solvent-POME mass ratio on oil recovery efficiency The oil was recovered from POME using four solvents including methanol, ethanol, n-hexane, and toluene. The solvents to POME ratio was varied between 0.2 and 1.2. Fig. 3 shows the influence of the molar ratio of each solvent on the yield of extracted oil. It can be seen from Fig. 3 when the amount of solvent in the POME solution was gradually increased, the yield of the extracted oil also increased. At the higher ratio of solvent to POME, a higher quantity of oil started to dissolve in the solvent due to the extensive quantity of solvent available to dissolve and saturate it with the oil and grease. However, 1:1 and 1:1.2 (oil to solvent ratio) indicated no increase in the amount of extracted oil for all solvents including methanol, ethanol, n-hexane, and toluene. Therefore, it can be said that the oil to solvent ratio of 1:1 is the saturation point of the oil extraction process, which shows that the stability of mixing has been formed and will reduce the characteristic of the solvent to extract the oil. The oil to solvent ratio of 1:1 was found to be the most appropriate ratio for the present extraction process performed using methanol, ethanol, n-hexane, and toluene. It can also be observed that higher oil yield using n-hexane as a solvent was obtained at the same solvent ratio in comparison with the other solvents. This shows that n-hexane has more extraction power towards the extraction of triglycerides because of its higher non-polar nature as compared to other solvents like methanol, ethanol, and toluene. Therefore, the use of n-hexane as a solvent for the dissolution and recovery of a soluble component of the liquid mixture is recommended as well as achieving higher oil recoveries [37]. The use of n-hexane also lowers the overall cost of the transesterification process. 3.1.2 Effect of agitation time on oil extraction efficiency The influence of time was also studied to optimize the yield of the extracted oil. The oil to solvent ratio for optimizing the time was kept at the solvent to POME ratio of 1:1. The mixing time was varied between 0 and 30 min with an increment of 5 min. The stirring speed was kept constant at 500 rpm as only time variation was studied, keeping all the other parameters constant. Fig. 4 indicates the mixing time effect on the yield of extracted oil between 0 and 30 min. It can be seen from Fig. 4, the recovery of oil continuously increased up to 25 min mixing time. This might happen because the equilibrium has been achieved at 25 min. The further increase of mixing time may not increase the recovery of the oil due to the stability of equilibrium and saturation of solvent with the solute. The distribution of molecules cannot be altered once the solvent to POME saturation has been achieved. Therefore, a further increase to 30 min reaction time has not increased the yield of the oil recovered. Hence, it can be concluded from Fig. 4 that the equilibrium yield of oil can be achieved in 25 min of mixing time for the solvents including methanol, ethanol, n-hexane, and toluene. At the optimized mixing time (25 min), n-hexane showed the highest oil recovery of 87.5%. The oil recovery using toluene as a solvent at 25 min is also closer to n-hexane. Thus, the use of n-hexane and toluene is more advantageous for the recovery of oil from POME over a specified range of mixing time. In terms of availability cost and non-polar nature, n-hexane is more advantageous over toluene giving maximum oil extraction efficiency proving its ability for cheaper and sustainable biodiesel production. 3.1.3 Effect of mixing speed on oil extraction efficiency Mixing promotes and maintains the homogeneity of the solution. The mixing is necessary to increase the miscibility of two immiscible components and helps to initiate the reaction by increasing the contact between components within the solution [38]. This promotes the favorable conditions necessary for mass transfer. When the rate of mixing increases, the contact between the immiscible components increases causing the rate of reaction or extraction process to boost up [12]. Fig. 5 expresses the effect of the rate of mixing on the recovery of oil. Fig. 5 shows that the recovery of oil increases along with the stirring speed due to an increase in the rate of mass transfer. Therefore, the increase of agitation speed increased the recovery of oil. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that maximum oil recovery occurred at 500 rpm. However, not a significant effect was observed between 400 rpm and 500 rpm. The agitation speed of 400 rpm and 500 rpm showed oil yields of 85% and 87.5%, respectively. The increase of agitation speed beyond 400 rpm is not a good decision for the economic perspectives when solvents including methanol, ethanol, n-hexane, and toluene are used. The increase of agitation speed beyond 400 rpm will not increase the extraction of oil and instead, mechanical energy dissipates in the form of heat causing the evaporation of the solvent. 3.1.4 Effect of pH on efficiency of the extracted oil Fig. 6 expresses the effect of pH on the extraction of oil from POME. As triglycerides and free fatty acids cover a major portion of the composition of residual oil present in POME. Therefore, the dissolution of oil and solvent was taken place due to their slightly soluble nature, especially for methanol and ethanol [30]. NaOH was added in the solution of POME and solvent to adjust the pH to study the influence on the oil recovery yield [39]. The extraction of oil reached a maximum value at a pH of 10 and it was constant at the pH of 12 for every solvent used. The maximum extraction of oil at the pH of 10 does not mean that this is the ideal pH for the extraction of oil from POME. However, it totally depends upon the base reagent used to adjust the pH. The addition of NaOH caused the reaction of triglycerides and solvent or hydrolysis resulting in the production of glycerol and soap. The saponification has taken place due to the presence of NaOH causing the soap formation. The soap solubility in the POME is much higher as compared to the organic solvents. Due to this reason, the weight of the oil was lesser in the solvent at a pH of 12, causing a significant decrease in the extraction of oil. The effect of pH was not found to be significant as compared to the other parameters affecting the oil extraction yield i.e., extraction of oil from POME increased slightly. Therefore, it is suggested to extract the oil at the pH of POME sample to avoid the hydrolysis reaction which takes place at the higher pH due to the use of acids and the basis for increasing the pH. The oil extraction study proved that the use of n-hexane showed the highest efficiency to recover the residual oil from POME. Summary of the performance of each solvent is shown in Table 4. 3.1.5 Analysis of extracted residual palm oil from POME The fatty acid composition of the residual palm oil extracted from POME was determined using GC-FID analysis. The capillary column used for this purpose had the dimensions of (30 × 0.25 × 0.25 mm). The Flame Ionization temperature was set at 240 ℃ with a flowrate of 0.5 mL/min. The injector temperature of the unit was also kept the same as the flame ionization detector temperature. The hydrogen was used as a carrier gas in the product analysis. The retention time of the components present in the sample oil was compared, and the components were identified based on the retention time. The composition of the recovered oil was determined and compared with the commercial Palm and Jatropha oil. The fatty acid composition of the recovered residual oil in comparison with commercial Palm and Jatropha oil is presented in Table 5. Table 5 shows that the residual palm oil extracted from POME possesses similar fatty acid composition as commercial Palm oil and Jatropha oil. The major components of palm oil and residual oil consist of palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid. The presence of these components in the POME led to produce palm oleate or palm-biodiesel [20]. The palm-biodiesel has significant advantages in comparison with the biodiesel produced from other first and second-generation feedstocks. The use of palm-biodiesel blends also exhibits much better combustion properties as compared to the pure diesel and biodiesel produced from other types of feedstocks. Table 5 presents the comparison of combustion properties of palm-biodiesel blends with other types of feedstocks. The combustion properties of pure diesel, palm-biodiesel blend (B20 and B50, and pure palm-biodiesel are presented. It can be observed from Table 6, pure diesel exhibits the highest cetane number and density as compared to other palm-biodiesel blends. However, the energy emission from the burning of pure palm-biodiesel is lower which indicates that higher biodiesel is burned in the engine to generate the same quantity of heat energy as compared to other biodiesel blends and pure diesel. Therefore, it is more appropriate and advantageous to use biodiesel blends like B10, B15, and B20 as fuel in diesel engines. The excellent characteristics of palm-biodiesel suggest that it will be more advantageous to use POME to extract the residual oil for the production of biodiesel. Moreover, an enormous amount of POME waste generated in palm oil-rich countries has the potential to utilize it as a cheaper source for biodiesel production."
7,Experimental and simulation results comparison of biodiesel production,"3.2 Experimental and simulation results comparison of biodiesel production The transesterification reaction behavior upon the variance of the process parameters was studied using conventional alkali-catalyzed transesterification as well as Aspen plus simulation model. The simulation results were compared with the experimental findings conducted for the synthesis of biodiesel from residual oil extracted from the POME. In the simulation study of transesterification, the reaction was initially taken place at the temperature of 60 ℃, the pressure of 1 atm, and oil to alcohol molar ratio (1:10) to obtain the biodiesel. The reactants were introduced at the initial temperature and pressure of 25 ℃ and 1 atm, respectively. The parameters were varied after conducting the reaction at the specified conditions. The simulation results obtained at these conditions are presented in Table 7. The simulation results showed a maximum yield of 93%. The concentration of KOH catalyst was kept as 1.5 wt% of the total weight of methanol. The results were compared with experimental findings of biodiesel synthesis. The effect of temperature, time, and oil to alcohol molar ratio was studied on biodiesel yield. 3.2.1 Influence of reaction temperature on biodiesel yield The reaction temperature is one of the parameters that can significantly affect the biodiesel yield during transesterification. The production of biodiesel via transesterification is an endothermic reaction in nature. In general, the transesterification reaction takes place between 25 ℃ and 60 ℃. The increase in temperature causes the biodiesel yield to increase because of the reaction directed towards the product side. This is due to the increase of solubility of triolein and methanol at elevated temperatures [40]. The higher temperature can help the residual palm oil to get enough energy to cross the reaction barrier and enhance the overall biodiesel yield. The temperature was varied between 30 and 70 ℃ at the constant operating parameters of oil to alcohol molar ratio of 10:1, a reaction time of 3 h, and catalyst loading of 1.5 wt%. The obtained experimental and simulation yield of biodiesel at different temperatures is presented in Fig. 7. The maximum biodiesel yield of 90% was achieved at 60 ℃ for both experimental and simulation transesterification conditions. However, the yield became constant at 60 ℃ and a further increase in biodiesel yield was not observed. At the temperature of 60 ℃, the maximum fraction of solvent started evaporating and the yield of biodiesel decreased due to the reaction taking place at the boiling point of solvent which is not the ideal temperature of biodiesel production using conventional heating. Hayyan et al. [41] obtained the optimum biodiesel yield of 84% using residual palm oil via KOH-catalyzed transesterification at the reaction temperature of 60 ℃, keeping all other operating conditions constant. The biodiesel yield obtained in the present study is significantly greater as compared to the published literature. Therefore, the optimized temperature of biodiesel synthesis using residual oil extracted from POME was found to be 60 ℃. Hence, the findings of the present study are comparably better as compared to the previous studies, proving the potential of residual palm oil as an appropriate substrate for biodiesel synthesis. 3.2.2 Effect of reaction time on biodiesel yield Reaction time plays a very important role in the transesterification reaction to maximize the conversion of triglycerides [42]. When the transesterification reaction starts, oil and solvent are not completely miscible and hence, the reaction takes place at the surface of the catalyst [43]. However, the solubility of oil and methanol increases as the reaction time increases that lead to an increase in the overall yield of biodiesel production via conventional heating [44]. The same trend was found in the simulation results with the time variance between (0–3 h). The increase in biodiesel yield was observed for experimental and simulated transesterification. The optimum simulation and experimental biodiesel yield of 90% and 92% were found at a reaction time of 2.5 h, respectively. The further increase of reaction time did not increase the concentration of fatty acid methyl esters. This might occur because of the equilibrium establishment between reactants and products. At this time, the available energy was occupied to achieve the equilibrium of transesterification giving maximum performance. The decrease in biodiesel yield was observed after 2.5 h. This can be explained by the fact that a further increase of reaction time has caused the hydrolysis of the reactants and products, promoting the soap formation. Fig. 8 indicates the effect of time on biodiesel yield for experimental and simulation findings, respectively. Aworanti et al. [40] investigated the synthesis of biodiesel from POME via KOH-catalyzed transesterification. The study was conducted varying the process parameters between 30 and 180 min. The optimum biodiesel yield of 61.2% was achieved at the optimized conditions of 2.5 h, 1.5 wt% catalyst loading, and alcohol to oil molar ratio of 12:1. It can be seen that the yield obtained by Aworanti et al. [40] was significantly lower in comparison with the findings of the present work. The use of POME for biodiesel production gave the highest biodiesel yield of 90% and proved the potential of oil and grease content to be further explored as a cheaper substrate. 3.2.3 Influence of oil to alcohol molar ratio on biodiesel yield Oil to alcohol molar ratio plays a very important role in the transesterification reaction. Biodiesel production via catalytic transesterification is reversible in nature [45]. Therefore, the oil to alcohol molar ratio is a crucial parameter to shift the reaction towards the glycerol and biodiesel side [46]. In general, higher oil to alcohol molar ratio results in a significant increase in the yield of biodiesel. To investigate the effect on biodiesel yield, oil to alcohol ratio was varied between 1:6–1:14 to optimize the biodiesel yield. The influence of oil to alcohol ratio on biodiesel yield and products concentration is presented in Fig. 9, that shows the biodiesel yield increased as the reaction was carried out at higher alcohol molar ratios. However, an increase in biodiesel yield was only observed until 12:1. This might be because of the better mixing of reactants and catalyst at the enhanced oil to alcohol molar ratios. The viscosity of the reaction mixture decreases and the rate of mass transfer increases, causing a significant increase in the catalyst activity to increase the biodiesel yield. The maximum biodiesel yield of 93% and 90% was achieved for the experimental and simulated biodiesel production at the reaction temperature of 60 ℃, and reaction time of 2.5 h. The further increase of oil to alcohol ratio beyond 12:1 did not increase the biodiesel yield. This might be due to the fact that equilibrium has been established due to which no further alcohol is needed in the reaction. The optimized yield of 91% was obtained at an oil to alcohol molar ratio of 1:12. Aworanti et al. [40] produced the biodiesel from residual oil extracted from POME using KOH as a basic catalyst. The optimum biodiesel yield of 61.2% was obtained at the oil to alcohol molar ratio of 1:12, reaction temperature of 60 °C, and reaction time of 2.5 h. The reduction in biodiesel yield was observed beyond the oil to alcohol molar ratio of 12:1. The decrease in biodiesel yield is caused due to the lower concentration of residual palm oil in the reactants mixture due to the over-limit of methanol concentration to reach the optimum reaction rate. Furthermore, the increased amount of methanol would lead the hydroxyl group in methanol to cause emulsification in the reaction system which makes the product separation more difficult, causing a decrease in biodiesel yield. The accumulation of methanol also causes the catalyst concentration to reduce and impede the reaction. From an economic point of view, the extensive increase in oil to alcohol molar ratio would only boost the overall cost of product separation."
8,Kinetic and thermodynamic modeling,"3.3 Kinetic and thermodynamic modeling The kinetics and thermodynamics of a reaction is important to study as it helps to determine the reaction behavior and its energy requirement so that the product concentration can be maximized, optimizing the input reaction parameters accordingly [47]. Therefore, a kinetic study of biodiesel synthesis is performed to determine the kinetic parameters including the order of reaction and reaction rate constant [48]. The power-law approach is one of the simplest and most commonly used approaches to determine the activation energy and rate constant values. It characterizes the course of the reaction by the temperature-dependent rate constant k(T) and component concentration or partial pressures, respectively. Several researchers have done the kinetic study of biodiesel synthesis considering three steps of production including intermediates of monoglycerides and diglycerides production [49–52]. However, single-step overall transesterification kinetics is advantageous as it is not time taking process and demands no analytical equipment. The rate expression can be presented as in Eq. (4). (4) − r A = − d C A dt = − 1 3 . d C B dt = k . C A n . C B m where -rA is the rate of reaction, CA and CB are the concentrations of the reactants A and B, k is the rate constant, and n and m are the reaction orders of the reactant A and B, respectively. As the alcohol ratio does not affect the rate of reaction significantly due to its excess amount present. Hence, this equation can be written as Eq. (5). (5) − r A = − d C A dt = k . C A n Putting CA = CAO (1 - X) in Eq. (5) and taking ln on both sides gives Eq. (6). (6) − d C Ao 1 − X A dt = k . [ C Ao 1 − X A ] n Substituting n = 1, as the transesterification reaction is first order. Eq. (6) can be simplified as expressed in the form of Eq. (7).

The temperature was taken in K, Ea in kJ/mol, pre-exponential factor in h−1, and R (8.314 J/mol. K) respectively. Fig. 10 shows the Arrhenius plot to calculate the activation energy and pre-exponential factor. The activation energy and Arrhenius constant values for the conventional transesterification were found to be 20 kJ/mol and 16.22 h−1, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters for the conventional transesterification reaction were found by the Eyring equation as presented in Eq. (13). (13) k = k * k B . T h e ( − ∆ G RT ) Where k is rate constant (min−1), k* is the transmission co-efficient and usually taken as 1 [53]. KB is the Stephen-Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10−23 J/K), and h is the Planck’s constant (6.63 × 10−34 J s). Replacing (∆G = ∆H - T.∆S) in Eq. (13) resulted in the expression shown in Eq. (14). (14) ln ( k T ) = − Δ H R ( 1 T ) + [ ln k * + ln ( k B h ) + Δ S R ] where ∆H and ∆S are interpreted as slope and intercept from the plot of ln k T and T−1 as shown in Fig. 11. The enthalpy and entropy for biodiesel production from residual palm oil were found to be 18 (kJ/mol), − 0.17 (kJ/mol. K), respectively."
9,Conclusions,"POME being an extensively generated industrial waste was effectively utilized for biodiesel synthesis. The oil extraction from POME was done using four solvents including methanol, ethanol, toluene, and n-hexane under the variation of mixing time, oil to solvent ratio, agitation speed, and pH. The soxhlet extraction method was used because of its cheaper nature for oil and grease recovery to further use the oil for biodiesel synthesis. The results exhibited that n-hexane has the highest oil recovery from POME following toluene, methanol, and ethanol. The oil extraction yield of 90% was achieved using n-hexane as an organic solvent at the optimized extraction conditions. The optimized parameters for oil extraction include the oil to solvent ratio of 1:1, mixing speed of 500 rpm, mixing time of 25 min, and pH of 10. The extracted oil from POME was used to synthesize the biodiesel using conventional heating and results were compared with Aspen plus batch reactor simulation results. The transesterification parameters including reaction time, reaction temperature, and alcohol to oil molar ratio were varied to optimize the biodiesel yield. The optimum biodiesel yield of 92% and 90% was achieved for experimental and simulated biodiesel synthesis at the optimized reaction conditions of alcohol ratio of 1:10, reaction time of 2.5 h, reaction temperature of 60 ℃, and catalyst loading of 1.5 wt%. The findings of this study using residual palm oil were significantly better in comparison with previous transesterification studies. Therefore, the use of POME can lead to cheaper biodiesel production. However, more research is required to maximize the biodiesel production using a response surface methodology optimizer and minimize the overall production cost so that industrial biodiesel production from POME can take place. The palm-biodiesel production will be prominent and favorable especially for palm oil-rich countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand etc."
