0,Introduction,"The use of fossil fuels is considered largely responsible for measured increase in the atmospheric CO2 levels (36% since 1800s [1]), causing a 1.4°F rise in the earths average temperature (from 1900 to 2000 [2]) and an increase in ocean acidity of 30% since the industrial revolution. Advancements in efficient biofuel technologies from sustainable and waste biomass are important for replacing fossil fuel demand, mitigating climate change, and addressing national security concerns. The Department of Energys Billion-Ton Study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory estimates a projected availability of up to 1.6 billion tons of sustainable biomass for processing by 2030 [3]. The process investigated in this paper is the thermo-chemical pathway involving two distinct steps: (1) thermal decomposition (gasification) of biomass to synthesis gas followed by: (2) catalytic conversion of synthesis gas into higher alcohols. The advantages of this route include the co-production of heat and/or electricity from the exothermic catalytic reaction during the Higher Alcohols Synthesis (HAS) process. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) remains the most studied catalyst for the production of higher alcohols from synthesis gas [4,5], though technological hurdles including high operating pressures, low product yields and selectivity remain to consider this system commercially viable. A series of alkali-doped MoS2 based catalysts were first patented by Dow Chemicals (now Union Carbide) in the 1970s. There is interest in these Mo-based catalysts for their ability to tolerate sulfur as wells as CO2 in the reactant syngas stream while non-Mo catalysts are sensitive to sulfur at very low concentrations. The inherent tolerance to sulfur could potentially eliminate a need for the desulfurization step, thus decreasing the process cost. Typically, sulfided catalysts require 50–100ppm sulfur in the gas stream to remain active. Also, MoS2 displays high water–gas–shift (WGS) activity and demonstrates higher selectivity toward ethanol than most other catalysts [6]. The operating temperature and pressure ranges of the sulfided Mo catalyst are 260–350°C and 435–2540psi respectively. The addition of sulfide enables the catalyst to promote hydrogenation. Similar to that of modified Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) catalysts, the modified sulfide catalysts follow the Anderson-Shultz Floury (ASF) product distribution [4]. The addition of an alkali directs products to alcohols instead of hydrocarbons by suppressing the tendency for the Mo active sites to promote hydrogenation [7,8]. Work has shown that the most effective alkali promoter is cesium, however potassium is commonly used [9]. A recent study showed that alkali- and metal-doped MoS2 catalysts (M-K/MoS2, M=Fe, Ni, Co) produced alcohols with a volumetric space–time–yield (STY) of 0.4g/ml cat. h alcohols under operating conditions of 340°C, 1378psi, H2/CO ratio of 1, and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 8500h−1 over 2000h with no apparent decrease in both the catalyst activity and the alcohol selectivity [6]. While catalyst nanoparticles could potentially show significant improvement in productivity, there are still limitations to the reaction system. The slurry-phase MoS2-catalyzed process is challenged with mass and heat transfer limitations in the presence of four phases (catalyst/non-aqueous/aqueous/gas). Thus, even with nano-sized catalysts, low yields are expected due to aggregation in a multi-phase environment. Thus, maximizing contact between various phases would increase STY. These challenges can be addressed by using supercritical solvents. A supercritical solvent can provide enhanced gas–liquid mass transfer due to unlimited CO2 solubility in supercritical phase, higher diffusion rates, increased reaction rates due to higher solubility of products and prevention of catalyst poisoning as well as improved reaction selectivity [10]. The solvents in supercritical conditions such as carbon-dioxide (sc-CO2), water (sc-H2O) and hydrocarbons has already been used in several homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic reactions [10–12]. Some examples of reactions that use sc-CO2 as solvent and/or reactant include: (1) hydrogenation of olefinic oils [13,14], unsaturated ketones [15] and alcohols [16,17], (2) oxidation of alcohols [18] and hydrocarbons [19], (3) C–C bond formation [20–23] (4) hydroformylation [24–27] and (5) synthesis of formic acid and derivatives [28,29]. Supercritical hydrocarbons have been used in Fischer–Tropsch (F–T), methanol and higher alcohols synthesis [30–38]. These reactions were reported to have increased conversion rates as well as improved selectivity when operating under the supercritical phase. For reactants, catalyst and products that have widely differing polarity and low miscibility, phase transfer catalysis (PTC) offers an efficient process by which faster reaction rates and increased selectivity can be achieved [39–41]. A phase transfer catalyst with surface active properties (e.g., alkyl quaternary salts) can be used to extract hydrophilic reactants from the water phase and deliver it to organic phase [40]. Moreover, interaction of reactants with phase transfer catalyst can itself reduce the kinetic activation energy of the reactants. Using this approach, reaction rates were found to increase up to three orders of magnitude compared to single phase reactions [40]. PTC is used in biomass conversion, oxidation, alkylation, and hydrofluorination reaction to enhance catalytic activity [42–48]. Interestingly, a homogeneous pseudo two-phase solvent (micelle-, microemulsion-, or emulsion-based) for heterogeneous catalytic reactions combines advantages of the phase-transfer catalysis and supercritical solvent systems. In addition, this pseudo 2-phase system can potentially increase the exposed surface area of MoS2 particles by containing them within microemulsion droplets that act as nano-reactors and thereby increase STY. Syngas components (CO, H2 and CO2), of interest here, have poor solubility in hydrophilic phases such as water or polyethylene glycol (PEG). Though the micellization phenomenon in PEG liquid is not well studied, the ethoxylated surfactants such as pluronics and polysorbates are known for micellar and oil/PEG microemulsions, respectively [49,50]. One such family of ethyoxylated surfactants, nonylphenol ethyoxlate, has been extensively studied for preparing sc-CO2 microemulsions in water [51,52]. Nanometer-sized MoS2 encapsulated in microemulsion droplets under super-critical conditions (high temperature and pressure) would increase contact between reactants and intermediates with surfaces of MoS2 catalyst particles. MoS2 is well known for its high selectivity to C2 alcohols and shows high stability with impurities, such as sulfur, in the feed gas stream [53]. Thus, our approach to improve heterogeneous catalytic higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) involves: (1) nano-sizing the traditional MoS2 catalyst and (2) employing microemulsion medium to disperse MoS2 nano-catalysts and increase contact with reactants. The premise is that a combination of the two would improve STY and selectivity for higher alcohols. This improvement would increase the economic feasibility of the technology to be an attractive candidate in the production of transportation fuels thus contributing to the Department of Energy renewable fuel standard (RFS) of 15 billion gallons [54]."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents The reagents were purchased from the following manufacturers: Mo(CO)6 (Acros Organics), sulfur, anhydrous hexadecane, hexane and methanol (Sigma–Aldrich). Ethylflo-164 polyalphaolefin (a C-30 oil), Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-400 (Fluka Analytical), Commercial MoS2 catalyst (<2μm) (The Chemical Co.), Tergitol NP-8 (Dow Chemical)."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis Synthesis of nano-sized MoS2 was achieved as follows. Mo(CO)6 (0.02mol) and elemental sulfur (S8) (0.02mol) were slurried in 70mL hexadecane solvent and added to a 300mL sonication flask. The system was purged with argon before sonication to remove oxygen from the system. The sonicator (Misonix Sonicator 3000; 60W) was programmed to pulse for 4s followed by 1s off time. The desired 70°C temperature of the reaction vessel was maintained by placing the reaction vessel in a water-cooled bath. To monitor the extent of reaction, the evolved CO was collected in an inverted graduated cylinder from which the extent of Mo(CO)6 decomposition was calculated at any given time. After about 30h when the Mo(CO)6 decomposition reached <90%, the sonication was stopped. The black slurry product was centrifuged, washed with n-hexane to yield a black powder. A detailed procedure developed by our group is described elsewhere [55,56]."
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction The batch evaluation of HAS reaction was conducted in a 300mL Parr stirred pressure vessel fitted with a Parr process controller. For all runs, the slurry was pre-pared with 70mL of either PEG-400 or C-30 oil solvent, 0.7g of MoS2 catalyst and specific amount (0.05M, 0.01M, and 0.002M) of Tergitol NP-8 surfactant for batch evaluation. The above specified concentrations of Tergitol NP-8 surfactant were selected to ensure that the values were above the critical micellar concentration (CMC) in water (0.088–0.1mM). The surface tension was measured using a surface tensiometer, Attension™ from Biolin Scientific employing the Wilhelmy plate technique. The slurry was then agitated using a homogenizer (Power Gen 125, Fischer Scientific). The pressure vessel was purged with syngas and then pressurized to 600 psi syngas of composition 66% H2/33% CO. Since the surfactant concentrations used was well above the CMC at the pressure, the formation of sc-CO-in-PEG microemulsions is expected. The pressure vessel was heated to an operating temperature of 250°C, 270°C, or 300°C and an operating pressure between 800 and 900psi. The reaction was allowed to run for approximately 8h, quenched to room temperature and the final pressure was noted. Gas and liquid samples were then taken for analysis and subsequent mass balance as completed for each run. The completed batch runs are listed in Table 1 . After the reaction, the catalyst particles were separated from the reaction slurry by centrifuge, washed with methanol, and dried at 70°C for one hour to prepare for post-reaction analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)."
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis A Perkin Elmer Frontier FT-IR spectrometer (380–4000cm−1) was used to map the vibrational spectra of the sonicated MoS2 particles. The SEM images were obtained with SEM, LEO 1550 SFEG Microscope operated at a voltage of 15kV. TEM (AMT Camera System; HV=80.0kV) was used to analyze surface topographies and particle size. For the analysis of reaction products, two GowMac 580 gas chromatographs (GCs) were configured to analyze gas samples from the batch runs. A Carboxen 1000 (45/60, 5′×1/8″) packed column was used for CH4 and CO2 analysis and a molecular sieve (9′×1/8″) packed column for CO analysis. For the CH4, CO2, and CO analysis, a He carrier was used (20cc/min) using the following settings: column temperature, 60°C; injector temperature, 60°C; detector temperature, 90°C; detector current, 150mV. The injector sample used for both of these methods was 500μL. The second GowMac 580 was set up for H2 analysis (sample size 250μL) using a molecular sieve 5A 80/100, 8′×1/4″) packed column with flowing N2 carrier gas (18cc/min) using the following settings: column temperature, 40°C; detector temperature, 60°C; detector current, 150mV. A GowMac series 600 GC fitted with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Poropak Q (100/120, 9′×1/8″) packed column was used for the analysis of alcohols by injecting a 1μL sample. The GC was first set up as follows: injector temperature, 200°C; detector temperature, 250°C and He as carrier gas (8cc/min). Gas and liquid hydrocarbon samples were analyzed on a Perkin Elmer Clarus 680 GC fitted with an alumina (8′×1/8″) packed column with flowing He as carrier gas (20cc/min). For analysis, an initial oven temperature of 120°C held for 3min; ramp of 30°C/min to 250°C. The sample size was 500μL for gas analysis and 2μ for liquid analysis."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst synthesis,"3.1 Catalyst synthesis For catalyst synthesis using sonolysis, the initial off-white slurry consisting of Mo(CO)6 (white powder) and sulfur (pale yellow powder) started to change color at the onset of sonication, and fully turned black within 10min. During sonication, CO evolved that was carefully collected. The collected CO produced from Mo(CO)6 decomposition was a measure of the extent of the reaction that indirectly measured disulfide molybdenum (MoS2) formation following the stoichiometry Mo/CO=1/6. The reaction was terminated by stopping sonication when the decomposition reached above 90%. A plot of CO evolution versus time (Fig. 1 ) shows that the observed Mo(CO)6 decomposition analyzed for first-order kinetics with a rate constant k =3×10−3 min−1 which is consistent with the value reported previously [55,56]. The FT-IR spectrum of the black product (Fig. 2 ) showed absorbance peaks indicative of as Mo–S (480cm−1) [57] and valence vibrations of Mo=S bond at 447cm−1 and 453cm−1 which is consistent with previous work [58]. Fig. 3 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of MoS2 as synthesized and after mixing with 0.01M Tergitol NP-8 in PEG-400 at 270°C. The figure shows spherical clusters and homogeneous size distribution with an average 15nm size with the freshly synthesized MoS2 sample (Fig. 3a). After mixing with the surfactant, however, the MoS2 nanoparticles aggregate into larger size of over 200nm (Fig. 3b). MoS2 nanoparticles (Fig. 3a) are hydrophobic and hence can be expected to aggregate strongly since the samples were prepared by drying from a hydrophilic solvent, namely PEG-400. The TEM images of the synthesized MoS2 particles, are shown in Fig. 4 a and b for the catalyst with freshly prepared and after encapsulation with Tergitol NP-8, respectively. Fig. 4a shows that the particle sizes of fresh catalyst are 10–20nm. After encapsulation, however, the material shows aggregated clusters, similar to those seen in the SEM images in Fig. 3 and consistent with previously reported work [55,56]."
8,Batch evaluation of nano-MoS2 catalyzed HAS reaction,"3.2 Batch evaluation of nano-MoS2 catalyzed HAS reaction The synthesized nanoparticles of MoS2 were evaluated for syngas conversion into higher alcohols in a 300mL Parr batch reactor. Eqs. (1) and (2) show the stoichiometries involved in CO hydrogenation to hydrocarbons and alcohols. (1) n CO + 2 n H 2 → ( – CH 2 – ) n + n H 2 O (2) n CO + 2 n H 2 → C n H 2 n + 1 OH + ( n - 1 ) H 2 (3) H 2 O + CO → H 2 + CO 2 Inevitably, CO2 is also produced via the WGS reaction (Eq. (3)) under typical reaction conditions. Given that Eq. (3) accompanies alcohols synthesis, the syngas conversion ratio is established by the extent of Eq. (3), irrespective of the initial CO/H2 ratio used. While the maximum stoichiometric ratio of H2/CO is 2/1, due to the WGS reaction, theoretically the stoichiometric maximum is calculated to be 1.7 [59]. In this study a 66%/34% CO/H2 ratio was used. The overall carbon conversion, carbon conversion (CO2-free basis), STY and selectivity of the commercial and sonicated MoS2 particles were measured and compared to previously reported catalyst screening studies [60,61]. The reaction conditions and data are shown in Table 1 and the results are compared in Figs. 5–10 . Note that the values in these figures are within 5%. Figs. 5 and 6 show the effectiveness of the nano-MoS2 catalyst for synthesis of higher alcohols, as measured by the total carbon conversion achieved during the run and the STY. With commercial micron-sized catalyst, the CO conversion maximized at 33%, irrespective of the solvent used: C-30 oil or PEG-400 both with and without the surfactant. Among all the runs with nano-sized MoS2, the conversion maximized at 91.2% with a run in PEG-400 at 300°C in the presence of 0.05M Tergitol NP-8 surfactant (Fig. 5). Nano sizing a micron-sized (commercial) catalyst increases its surface area, a key parameter responsible for the observed increase in catalytic activity with nano-sized MoS2 particles. However, the CO2 production during HAS is wasted carbon, so a better measure of carbon conversion is CO2-free basis or CO that leads to useful products, namely hydrocarbons or alcohols. The carbon conversion on a CO2-free basis, a better picture emerges on carbon conversion. The CO conversion (on a CO2-free basis) drops from 91.2% to 36.6% with the nano-MoS2 and from 16.7 to 6.2 for the commercial catalyst (Fig. 5). The addition of surfactant to the commercial catalyst showed a decrease in CO conversion from 18.3% to 6.2%. However, the nano-sized MoS2 catalyst showed an enhancement in the CO conversion from 21.1% to 28.6% with the addition of Tergitol NP-8 [0.01M] in PEG-400 solvent. Overall, the results showed that the CO conversion is enhanced when the nano-sized MoS2 is used in the presence of a surfactant (Fig. 6). The effect of temperature on carbon conversion was noted. At 300°C, nano-MoS2 in the presence of 50mM surfactant produced higher CO2 as by-product (compare Figs. 5 and 8). Without surfactant, the commercial catalyst (micron-sized MoS2) achieved 32.0% CO conversion in C-30 oil solvent that dropped to 18.3% in PEG-400 solvent. Next, the production of C1–C4 hydrocarbons and STY of alcohols were compared for runs shown in Figs. 7 and 8. The nano MoS2 catalyst runs, with and without surfactant, yielded an STY of 33.7 (mmol OH/mol cat./min) performing 39.7% higher than that of comparative commercial catalyst. On average, the surfactant enhanced nano-MoS2 in a polar solvent had a higher STY of alcohols than in the absence of Tergitol NP-8 (3.67mmol OH/mol cat/min). The observed increase in conversion and STY with the nano-sized MoS2 are attributed to a higher surface area of the nanoparticles compared to the micron-sized particles of the commercial catalyst. The addition of a surfactant hindered carbon conversion of the commercial catalyst though it increased the conversion with the nano-sized MoS2. This trend suggests that the particle sizes of the commercial catalysts is too large to be contained in the microemulsion droplet phase and may have increased aggregation of nanoparticles and destabilized the microemulsion phase. Whereas, smaller nano-sized MoS2 particles are likely to be well dispersed in the hydrophobic droplet phase and thereby increase exposed surface area of the catalyst for HAS. The size seemed to affect selectivity to particular alcohol. The commercial catalyst showed selectivity toward C1–OH at 21.9% of total products without showing much difference with the addition of Tergitol NP-8. The nano-MoS2 attained 33.3mol% C2–OH selectivity (Fig. 9). The STY and selectivity of alcohols data were compared for runs at three Tergitol NP-8 concentrations of 2mM, 11mM and 53mM in PEG-400 at 270°C (Figs. 10 and 8). While at Tergitol concentration of up to 11mM, no beneficial effect was seen, almost doubling of the STY was observed when the Tergitol NP-8 reached 53mM (Fig. 8). On the other hand, the product selectivity still showed preference toward C2–OH (Fig. 10). However, the selectivity shifted toward C1–OH as the concentration of Tergitol NP-8 increased (Fig. 10). Hydrocarbon analysis shows insignificant concentrations (<1%) of C5–C8 hydrocarbons."
9,Possible mechanisms for observed improvement in STY and selectivity,"The hydrophobic phase consisting of syngas (sc-CO, sc-CO2 and H2), and nanoparticles are encapsulated in microemulsion droplets, thus increasing the interaction between the reactants and the catalyst particles (Fig. 11 ) while improving the mass and heat transfer rates. The mechanism proposed above would overcome limitations of the 4-phase system in which typical slurry systems for syngas catalysis operate by producing more homogeneous slurry for the reaction system. The use of supercritical medium as a solvent in heterogeneous multiphase catalytic systems is postulated to have several advantages: (1) increased gas–liquid mass transfer due to unlimited gas solubility in supercritical phase, (2) higher diffusion rates, (3) increased reaction rates due to higher solubility of products and (4) prevention of catalyst poisoning as well as improved reaction selectivity [10]. The F–T and alcohol synthesis reactions of syngas are generally not conducted in sc-CO2 or sc-H2O [11]. These solvents can alter the ratio of CO or H2 through WGS or the reverse WGS reactions and this ratio critically determines the efficacy and selectivity of the F–T catalysts. Thus, supercritical hydrocarbon solvents such as methane, propane, pentane, and hexane have been investigated for F–T reactions [30–38] as well as for synthesis of methanol and higher alcohols from syn-gas [62–64]. An increase in conversion rates, improvement in mass and heat transfer rates and product selectivity was reported. Even though we have not explicitly shown the formation of a microemulsion phase under the reaction conditions, we expect formation of such phase for the following reasons: CO2 is known to form a microemulsion phase under supercritical conditions in water when stabilized by surfactants [65–69]. Similar data on CO and H2 are lacking. However, the solubility of CO and H2 in water are much lower than CO2. The Bunsen coefficients of CO and H2 at 298K are 0.022mL and 0.0176mL per mL of pure water [70], respectively as compared to CO2 (0.75–0.9mL of CO2 per mL of water) [71]. Thus, CO and H2 molecules can be expected to form microemulsion phase in water or in similar hydrophilic phases when stabilized by surfactants. Additionally, the particles themselves can be used to stabilize the interface [72]. For example, oxides [73], carbon nanotubes [74], and hybrids of oxide–carbon nanotubes [75] as well as metal–carbon nanotubes [76] were used in stabilizing emulsion droplets. In particular, Pd-laden carbon nanotubes catalysts have been used to stabilize water–oil emulsions in a biomass-refining process application [33]. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports in literature in which microemulsion system have been used for syngas conversion to alcohols. Our work described here is the first that reports beneficial effects of microemulsion-based conversion of syngas to higher alcohols."
10,Conclusions,We have shown that nanoparticles of MoS2 exhibit superior performance for HAS from syngas when carried out in a supercritical microemulsion medium. The microemulsions are stabilized by a non-ionic ethoxylated surfactant (Tergitol NP-8) in PEG-400 solvent as a continuous phase. A significant increase in STY for alcohol production as well as in selectivity for ethanol was observed with these encapsulated systems. A superior performance is attributed to a better dispersion of nanoparticles as well as improved mass and heat transfer characteristics of the system due to the use of microemulsion medium.
