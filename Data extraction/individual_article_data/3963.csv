0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an attractive fuel for energy storage and conversion applications due to its high gravimetric energy density [1,2]. Currently, hydrogen is produced mostly from fossil fuels [3,4] and only ∼4% of hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis [5]. However, huge volume of high purity hydrogen can be produced through PEM water electrolysis without the consumption of nuclear resources or fossil fuels and without releasing the harmful pollutants [6]. Therefore, PEM water electrolysis is recognized as essential and sustainable methods for hydrogen production from renewable energy sources [7,8]. In PEM water electrolysis process water is a reactant, which is dissociated to hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) under the influence of direct current .This process has several advantages like high efficiency and produced high purity of the gasses [9–11]. However, precious noble metals have been used as the electrocatalysts such as Pt based materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at cathode and IrO2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode in PEM electrolysis, which makes more expensive [12–17]. Pt is the standard electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reactions but it is expensive and has rerative scarcity too. To make the process economic feasible it is required to decrease the production cost by improving the electrocatalytic activity and durability of the electrocatalysts. Hence, it is recommonded to find out alternatives to Pt based electrocatalysts. A alternative non-Pt based low cost electrocatalysts should be needed for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In HER, hydrogen adsorption and desorption steps are the two consecutive reactions on the surface of the electrocatalyst. Hence, low hydrogen binding energy electrocatalysts will not be able to adsorb the hydrogen which is the initial step for HER while that with high binding energy will be reluctant for the desorption of hydrogen. Therefore, an ideal HER electrocatalyst should have optimum hydrogen adsorption and desorption energies. The hydrogen adsorption energy on the different metal surface was calculated by Norskov et al. and plotted volcano plot [18]. According to the volcano plot, Pd has adsorption energy and exchange current close to Pt, hence Pd is a capable HER catalyst and can be used as an alternative for Pt towards HER [18]. Apart from that, Pd is known to have high hydrogen adsorption energy right after Pt, not only from the gas phase but it has the ability to absorb large amounts of hydrogen from electrolytes as well. At room temperature and under ambient pressure H+ ions occupy the octahedral voids present within the Pd lattice leading to PdHx formation. The unique properties like incredible tendency and selectivity for hydrogen adsorption, fast adsorption kinetics, and reversible hydride formation empower Pd based materials to produce high purity of hydrogen [19]. Therefore, special focus has been given to Pd nanoparticles towards the hydrogen evolution reaction in PEM water electrolysis. Moreover, Pd is one of the Pt group metals with good HER activity and possess high energy density, decent electrical conductivity, high surface area and corrosion stability under oxidizing conditions, which is more ample than Pt although remarkable electroanalytical properties and less amount of studies carried out this kind of applications [20,21]. Pd based electrocatalysts look a capable replacement for Pt based electrocatalysts for PEM water electrolysis [22–25], since Pd has a lower cost than Pt, shown several qualities similar to Pt such an effective electrocatalyst for HER such as approximately equal hydrogen binding energy and exchange current density [26–28]. Further, to increase the HER performance and decrease the precious noble metal content in the electrocatalyst different carbons are used as support materials that increase the surface area and electrical conductivity [29]. Support material must have good electrical conductivity, high surface area, optimum porosity and high stability in an acidic environment. Recently, several researchers have reported various types of carbons as a support material such as carbon black (CB), carbon nanomaterials (CNMs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), Graphene and Fullerenes towards the HER in PEM water electrolysis [30,31]. However, the performance of HER with carbon based materials is still not sufficient to achieve the same level as that with Pt based catalysts due to its inherent characteristics of limited active sites on the chemically inert sp2 carbon framework for HER reaction. In order to increase the number of active sites on the carbon surface and improve the catalytic activity by doping of heteroatoms with carbons is one such promising way to increase the electrochemical ability. It has been reported that the electrochemical performance could be improved by introducing the different heteroatoms (N, P, and S) that occur due to the electronic structural modification [32–36]. Among various hetero atom dopants, electron-deficient boron (B) is recognized as a capable component for the promising chemical dopant on carbons due to having only three valence band electrons, which is permitting the chemically functionalize inert sp2 carbon framework and start the copious free-flowing π electrons and act as electrocatalyst [36]. Moreover, the addition of boron (B) could significantly increase the carbon conductivity by increasing the density of hole type charge carriers [37,38]. These virtues boost the carbons electrocatalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction, therefore, the B-doped carbons have gained a growing interest in recent years. According to the strain effect with increasing the boron component in the carbon nanoparticles, the hydrogen binding energy is decreased linearly, at the same time with increasing the lattice constant hydrogen binding strength is weakened at the same binding site. For HER reaction, the palladium binds very strongly with the surface of carbons, while adding the electron deficient boron to the carbon, the binding energy is decreased to be active [39]. Stamenkovic and co-workers proposed that the volcano plot of reactivity vs. d-bond center, doping with proper heteroatom could turn the Pd electronic structure and then cause a downshift of its d-bond center leading to enhance the Pd catalytic activity [40]. Typically, Pd activity has been improved by mixing with another metal to form a core-shell structure. Incorporating a light metalloid of boron (B) to the interstices of the Pd lattice is a new approach for enhancing the activity of Pd. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on B-doped carbon nanoparticles (B-CNPs) for the hydrogen evolution electrode in PEM water electrolysis. The present study is focused on the electrochemical performance of B-doped carbon nanoparticles towards the hydrogen evolution reaction in PEM water electrolysis. In this study, B-doped carbon nanoparticles with various boron doping percentages have been effectively synthesized by using in-house fabricated chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and used as an HER electrode in PEM water electrolysis for hydrogen production."

The catalyst loadings on the membrane were maintained 3 mg cm−2 at the anode and 0.7 mg cm−2 for the cathode. Later, the catalyst coated membrane sandwiched between Teflon sheets and hot pressed with 120 °C temperature under 60 kg cm−2 pressure for 3 min to form a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) [17,41]. The active area of the MEAs was 25 cm2."

8,Results and discussions,
9,Physio-chemical characterization,"3.1 Physio-chemical characterization Fig. 1 shows the typical FE-SEM images of synthesized B3-CNPs and 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs electrocatalyst. Fig. 1 (a, b) shows the FE-SEM images of B3-CNPs were agglomerated a uniform spherical shape morphology and the nanoparticles have consisted of clusters with an average diameter of 50–100 nm. Fig. 1 (c, d) shows the FE-SEM images of 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs, the nanoparticles were agglomerated a highly packed surface morphology, the palladium nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the surface of carbon nanoparticles. Further surface roughness was observed for 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs electrocatalyst which is significant evidence in terms of applicability of these electrocatalysts in a PEM water electrolysis [8]. Fig. 2 (a) shows the EDS image of 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs which is consisted of FE-SEM results. Fig. 2 (b) shows the EDS elemental analysis spectrum of the synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs electrocatalyst, which was confirmed the presence of Carbon (C), Palladium (Pd) and Boron (B) respectively with an elemental composition 65.68, 4.98 and 29.34 respectively, as represented in Table 1 . Further, the palladium loading on B3-CNPs was determined by ICP analysis, the obtained results have shown 29.48% of Pd was deposited on the surface of B3-doped carbon nanoparticles in the synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs electrocatalyst. Fig. 3 shows the TEM images along with the particle size distribution of synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs electrocatalyst. From Fig. 3(a–d), it was concluded that the 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs were relatively small and uniform spherical in shape morphology. The inter planer distance of 0.36 nm was calculated from lattice fringes from the HRTEM images (Fig. 3e) and they correspond to the crystallographic planes of the palladium (111) (Pd), which is in congruent with the XRD results. Further, particle size distribution in 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs was estimated from the TEM images by using the ImageJ software. The histogram of the particle size distribution as shown in Fig. 3f reveals that the homogeneous nanostructured Pd particles were uniformly distributed on the surface of B-doped carbon nanoparticles (B3-CNPs) and the average particle size was 66.63 nm with corresponding to the strong bonding between palladium and carbon (B3-CNPs). This phenomenon advantage for stable electrochemical performance in long term operation, this may be due to the larger surface area of the 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs and which is consisted with XPS results. Fig. 4 shows X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs electrocatalyst. XRD pattern is a useful method to differentiate the compositions and crystallinity of the synthesized materials. From Fig. 4 the major diffraction peaks at around 40.00°, 46.26° and 68.12° was observed from the Pd, corresponding to the crystallographic planes of {111}, {002}, and {022}. The broad peak at around 26.56° was observed from the carbon with equivalent crystallographic planes of {002} [36,42]. From the XRD results, the synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs electrocatalyst was found to be highly crystalline in nature. Further, the crystallite size of 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs were calculated from major X-ray diffraction peaks of palladium {111} using the Debye–Scherrer's equation [42,43] as shown in Eq. (1), The calculated crystallite size of 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs is 3.42 nm. (1) D = k λ β cos θ Where D is the average diameter in nm, k indicates the Debye–Scherrer's constant (0.89), λ is the wavelength of X-rays (λ = 0.154 nm), β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak and θ is the Bragg's diffraction angle. XPS analysis has been carried out for 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs in the binding energy range of 0–1000 eV to study the surface elemental composition in the present material. The survey spectrum in Fig. 5 shows the presence of boron (B), carbon (C), oxygen (O) and palladium (Pd). The substitution level of boron into the carbon framework was calculated from the relative intensities of B1s, O1s, and C1s within the XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 5). It shows that almost 6.68% atomic percentage of boron was doped on carbon nanoparticles, as shown in Table .2 . The presence of B1s peak (190.76 eV) instead of the original B peak (188 eV) shows the incorporation of boron into the carbon framework [44,45]. The XPS spectrum of C1s (Fig. 6 (a)) shows the four distinguishable peaks such as 284.8 eV, 285.17 eV, 285.75 eV, and 289.64 eV corresponding to the different chemical atmosphere of carbon atoms bonded to carbon in carbon nanostructures such as C—C, C—O, C=O, C—C=O respectively. The intense peak (284.8 eV) in the spectrum of B-C corresponds to the C—C sp2 bonded graphite based carbon, indicating that the majority of carbon atoms in the B-C are arranged in a conjugated honeycomb structure. Fig. 6 (b) shows the XPS spectrum of B1s, having three major components such as BC3 (190.72 eV), BC2O (192.16 eV), and BCO2 (193.75 eV) corresponding to the three different doping positions of boron within the carbon nanoparticles. In Fig. 6 (b) appearance of two higher energy level peaks (BC2O and BCO2) indicates the successful doping of boron atoms with carbon and oxygen. Fig. 6 (c) shows the O1s spectrum that has three major peaks such as 533.11 eV, 536.08 eV and 531.04 eV with corresponding to the different chemical bonding between carbon and oxygen such as COO¯, C=O, and C-OH respectively. Fig. 6 (d) shows the deconvoluted XPS spectrum of Pd3d, shows the Pd peak can be deconvolved into some pairs of doublets (Pd and PdO) as shown clearly in Fig. 6 (d). The corresponding to the relative areas of the integrated intensity of the Pd and PdO peaks were found in 335.58 eV, 340.73 eV, 336.98 eV, 342.13 eV, 344.24 eV, 339.31 eV and 347.22 with different compositions of Pd, which is an indication that effective doping of Pd on carbon framework [46,47]."
10,Electrochemical characterization,"3.2 Electrochemical characterization Cyclic voltammetry studies were carried out using a glassy carbon working electrode made up of 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs and 30 wt% Pt/CB electrocatalysts respectively and the obtained cyclic voltammograms are represented in Fig. 7 . From Fig. 7 both the electrocatalysts potentiodynamic curves were similar in shape and structure. The electrochemical surface areas (ECSA) of both the catalysts were calculated from the cyclic voltammograms of 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs and 30 wt% Pt/CB respectively. The ECSA of 30 wt% Pt/CB catalyst was calculated by columbic charge associated with hydrogen adatoms desorption (QH). (2) ECSA = Q H Q HO × M Where QHO indicates the amount of electricity per unit area, corresponding to the full coverage of one monolayer of hydrogen on the surface of Pt metal particle, QHO is 0.21 mC Cm−2 and M is the metal fraction of the electrocatalyst taken [36,42]. The ECSA of the 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs was calculated similarly but using the reduction peak of chemisorbed oxygen was considered. The specific amount of corresponding to the full coverage of one monolayer of oxygen on the Pd surface was taken as 0.41 mC Cm−2 [48,49]. The obtained ECSA results of 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs and 30 wt% Pt/CB electrocatalysts were shown practically approximately equal ECSA which is of 32.42 m2.gm−1, 31.26 m2.gm−1 respectively. Therefore, similar electrochemical performance can be expected for both the catalysts. Further, the stability of the synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs electrocatalyst was assessed by repetitive cyclic voltammogram up to 100 cycles within the potential range of −0.2 – + 1V (vs. SCE) with the scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 0.5M H2SO4 solution and the obtained results are represented in Fig. 8 . The hydrogen adsorption and desorption peaks were clearly visible during the continuous potential cycles, as represented in Fig. 8 also shown stable hydrogen evolution current since after 100 repetitive cycles. Therefore the Pd/B3-CNPs have shown stable electrochemical performance towards the hydrogen evolution reaction in an acidic environment. The characteristic peak of chemisorbed oxygen in Pd/B3-CNPs was slowly decreased after several potential cycles with decreases in the lower current (−2.0 mA to −1.48 mA) up to 100 cycles, may be due to the dissolution of the palladium nanoparticles at the higher potential, which is an acceptable degradation current [50]. The electrocatalytic activity of as-synthesized various B-doping carbon nanoparticles (B1-CNPs, B2-CNPs, B3-CNPs and B4-CNPs) were first evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) method for the HER region in 0.5M H2SO4 solution with the scan rate of 5 mVs−1, in the interval of 0–0.5V, the attained results are presented in Fig. 9 a. From the results it was observed that with increasing the boron content, the maximum cathodic peak current density increases from 1.5 (CNPs) to 1.8 (B1-CNPs), 2.1 (B2-CNPs), 3.7 (B3-CNPs) and 3.3 (B4-CNPs) mA cm−2 respectively with an onset potential of −0.5V. These results indicating that the electrocatalytic activity of the B-CNPs for the HER increases with increasing the B-doping. The B3-CNPs have shown the highest electrocatalytic activity. Further, it was used as the support material for Palladium (Pd) electrocatalyst for HER. The electrochemical performance of as-synthesized various B3-CNPs supported Pd electrocatalysts (5 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs, 10 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs, 20 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs, and 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs) along with commercial 30 wt% Pt/CB electrocatalyst were studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) method towards the HER region in 0.5M H2SO4 solution with the scan rate of 5 mVs−1 in the intervals of 0–0.5V, the attained results are presented in Fig. 9b. from the Fig. 9b it was obsorved that with increasing the palladium (Pd) content, the maximum cathodic peak current density increases from 7.8 (5 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs), 10.8 (10 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs), 13 (20 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs), 18.3 (30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs) and 20 (30 wt% Pt/CB) mA cm−2 respectively with an observed onset potential of −0.5V. The attained results have shown that the electrochemical performances were increased with increasing the Pd content. The synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs electrocatalyst has shown better electrochemical performance, moreover, it shows almost similar electrochemical performance compared to the commercial 30 wt% Pt/CB electrocatalyst. Hence, it can be used as the hydrogen evolution electrode."
11,PEM water electrolysis performance,"3.3 PEM water electrolysis performance The electrolysis performance of as-fabricated MEAs containing 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs electrocatalyst was studied at different current densities up to 2 A cm−2. Typical, study state current-voltage polarization curves were recorded along with corresponding yields of hydrogen at different temperatures up to 80 °C using the DI water, as shown in Fig. 10 and Table 3 . The cell voltage gradually decreased as the function of temperature increases up to 80 °C because of improvement of the kinetics of the HER at higher temperatures [50]. Further, cell efficiency was measured with the function of temperature according to the first law of thermodynamics and presented in Fig. 11 . It was obsorved that the cell efficiency was gradually increased (67–72%) with increasing the temperature. However, the cell voltage was decreased with increasing the temperature owing to the increased kinetics (electrocatalytic activity and performance) at higher temperatures [51]. The electrolysis performance of as-synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs electrocatalyst was compared with commercial 30 wt% Pt/CB electrocatalyst as HER electrode in PEM water electrolysis cell at 80 °C using 25 cm2 MEAs. Typical study state current-voltage polarization curves are presented in Fig. 12 . Both the cases were maintained at the same catalyst loading and experimental conditions. The attained cell voltages are 2.04 V–30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs and 2.01 V–30 wt% Pt/CB respectively at an operating current density of 1000 mA cm−2 (1 A cm−2). The results show that the synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs was exhibited approximately similar electrochemical performance compared to commercial 30 wt% Pt/CB. A stability test using 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs as cathode electrocatalyst for HER was performed under constant mode at 1 A cm−2 at 80 °C for 500 h and the attained results are presented in Fig. 13 . It was pound that the observed cell voltage of 2.04 V was almost stable during the 500 h continuous operation and it is indicating that the 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs electrode containing MEA was exhibited excellent stability towards the HER in PEM water electrolysis. From the qualitative point of view, the attained results of 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs for the HER at the cathode ware exhibited almost similar electrochemical performance compared to commercial 30 wt% Pt/CB. In the economical point of view, the synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs were less expensive compared to 30 wt% Pt/CB [35]. Therefore, the synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs can be used as an alternative to Pt-based electrocatalysts for HER in PEM water electrolysis. Furthermore, the synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs electrocatalyst can be used as a bi-functional catalyst for both HER and ORR in a fuel cell [52]. Because palladium (Pd) has attracted considerable attention since it is one of the Pt group metals with good HER and ORR activity. Meanwhile, the synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs having better electrochemical properties such as high surface area, high energy density, decent electrical conductivity, well crystallinity, corrosion stability under oxidizing conditions and showed good electrocatalytic activity towards HER. Moreover, the boron (B) doping could significantly increase the carbon conductivity by increasing the density of hole type charge carriers. These virtues boost the carbons electrocatalytic activity towards the HER and ORR."
12,Conclusion,"In the present study, Boron doped Carbon Nanoparticles (B-CNPs) with various boron doping percentages were successfully synthesized and used as a support material for Pd nanoparticles. A novel Pd/B3-CNPs electrocatalyst with various amounts of Pd were synthesized by the chemical reduction method and used as HER electrode for the fabrication of MEAs. The prepared MEAs electrochemical performances were studied in-house fabricated 25 cm2 single cell PEM water electrolyser and their performance compared with commercial 30 wt% Pt/CB. The attained results show that the synthesized 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs electrocatalyst revealed a comparable electrochemical activity than commercial 30 wt% Pt/CB. This is probably due to the better electronic structure of the electrocatalyst with higher activity of the substrate. Moreover, Palladium (Pd) which is less expensive than Platinum (Pt), therefore 30 wt% Pd/B3-CNPs can be used as an alternative to Pt based electrocatalysts for HER in PEM water electrolysis."
