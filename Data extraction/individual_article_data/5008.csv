0,Introduction,"The world is largely relying on the energy obtained from non-renewable resources like fossil fuels due to the high energy content and existing conventional technologies. The exponential increase in the consumption of fossil fuels is leading towards the demand and supply strain along with severe environmental problems [1,2]. Renewable energy resources such as bioenergy, solar energy and wind energy are alternatives to escalate challenges in the energy sector [3]. The renewable resources added a significant share in world energy production and a decrease in global emissions [4,5]. Among those, the waste resources have been used to produce biofuels which can play a significant part in the energy sector and a vital role to improve the socio-economic scenarios of the world [6,7]. According to Newcomb J. [8], direct and indirect investments can reach up to 150 billion USD by 2022 in waste to the energy sector. Among the biofuels, biodiesel has various benefits, which can be utilized as a substitute in existing diesel engines [9]. Biodiesel derived from renewable sources such as vegetable oil or plant and animal fat have the ability to replace conventional diesel as an eco-friendly alternative fuel [10,11]. It is used in diesel engines due to the comparable properties of flow and combustion with low emission profile. It can also be blended with petrodiesel, resulting in low emission without compromising the combustion efficiency of the engines [12]. Biodiesel has three generations of the substrate [1]; first-generation being edible plants [13] e.g. corns and soybeans, second-generation includes non-edible plants such as jatropha, Pongamia pinnata, wood, and plant waste [14], while the third generation involves improvements in the production of biomass such as microalgae [15,16]. Another aspect is the recycling of the waste substrates of edible oils seeking much consideration in recent time. Among the various substrates, waste cooking oil (WCO) is one of the strong contenders for biodiesel production since direct discarding may lead to various health and environmental concerns [17,18]. However, the WCO has high moisture and free fatty acid (FFA) content. Hence, due to these properties of WCO, pre-treatment is performed prior to the transesterification process to avoid saponification and calorific value [19]. To improve the biodiesel yield and ensuring sustainable process, various catalyst systems such as homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts have been practised [20,21]. The esterification reaction requires an acidic catalyst, while a basic catalyst is sufficient for transesterification reaction [22,23]. To date, the homogenous acid or alkali catalysed methods are feasible methods for transforming WCO into biodiesel [24,25]. Homogenous catalysts are relatively moderate in the activity due to soap formation during the purification process which contributes to the inability to recover the glycerol [26]. For raw materials with high FFA content, strong acidic catalysts are preferable because of their ability to inhibit soap formation which results in high biodiesel yield [27]. Moreover, the homogenous catalyst is not cost-efficient as it requires effluent treatment after the transesterification process [20]. A heterogeneous catalyst is a more suitable option for easy separation and reusability with better catalytic activity and stability being reported [27-29]. Various heterogeneous catalyst systems have been employed i.e alkali doped materials, transition metal oxides, hydrotalcite and silica based materials [30-32]. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are the emerging heterogeneous materials with a wide range of applications in scientific research such as for energy storage, catalytic activities and electrochemistry magnetism [33]. MOFs are porous solids with a well-structured assembly of coordinated bonds between metal ions and organic ligands [34]. MOFs have a moderate surface area and more sites for the catalytic application, making them a promising alternative for stable biodiesel production [35-37]. Copper-based MOF efficiently oxidizes alcohols as heterogeneous catalysts, converting them into corresponding products which can be a promising catalyst for enhanced and stable biodiesel production [36,37]. The synthesis of calcium-based MOF with a versatile precursor as carbonate is advantageous for processability and optimization of the transesterification process [38]. The application of MOF based catalysts for biodiesel production is limited. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the employment of MOF based catalyst for biodiesel synthesis using WCO as substrate [2]. Apart from the catalyst, various process parameters play significant roles in enhancing and stabilizing biodiesel production. The optimization of process parameters for large-scale biodiesel production is usually taken as static while few studies have been reported for dynamic optimization using various techniques [39]. The dynamic process optimization of biodiesel allows analysing the interaction among the process variables and biodiesel yield. Response surface methodology (RSM) is the optimization technique based on design of experiment (DoE) and regression analysis [16,40]. RSM can scrutinize the impact of process variable on responses and also determine the optimum conditions of the process [41,42]. RSM also allows the justification of the statistical models for analysis to increase the capacity of the biodiesel production for commercial scale. The central composite design (CCD) has some substantial advantages over other optimization techniques such as the Box-Behnken and Doehlert matrix. The CCD offers more experiments compared to other optimization approaches which lead to better process optimization. In some case studies, it has been found that a process can be optimized up to 99% when using CCD, while other techniques only yielded a maximum of 95% optimization [43]. This study presents the synthesis structured catalysts (Ca and Cu MOFs) and tests for biodiesel synthesis from WCO. The catalyst is then characterized using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) techniques. The produced biodiesel using MOF catalysts is further characterized and compared with the ASTM standards. Moreover, RSM was used to study the interaction of independent process parameters and optimum conditions for biodiesel yield. The central composite design (CCD) was used to investigate the effect of input variables such as catalyst loading (X1), reaction temperature (X2) and alcohol-oil volume ratio (X3) on the percentage yield of biodiesel (YBD %). Furthermore, the dynamic relationship between the process variables and the product yield with optimum parameters are reported. The recycling of the catalyst is ensured which is essential for large-scale biofuel production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) and used without any purification. Chemicals such as copper (II) sulphate anhydrous (CuSO4·5H2O) (Sigma 99.99%), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) ACS reagent (Sigma, 99%), 1, 4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC) (Sigma, 98%), methanol (MeOH) (ACS reagent 99.8%), dimethylformamide (DMF) (Sigma 99.99%), H2SO4 (Sigma, 98%), potassium hydroxide (KOH) (Sigma, 85%) and deionized (DI) water. The WCO was collected from NUST cafeteria and filtered to eradicate insoluble contaminations and impurities. The substrate was heated at 105 °C to remove the moisture before being used to perform the analysis to investigate the properties of WCO. The following properties were reported: density = 0.88 g cm−3, viscosity = 4.86 mm2 s−1, moisture = 5%, pH = 9.5 and FFA = 19%."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation 2.2.1 Synthesis of the copper-based metal organic framework (Cu-MOF) The synthesis of the Cu-MOF was performed by using a modified solvothermal method as shown in Fig. 1 (a) [44]. 1:1 M ratio of the metal salt (CuSO4·5H2O) and benzene-1, 4-dicarboxylic acid (BDC) were dispersed in DI water and DMF respectively. After being mixed together in a beaker, the sample was kept on a hotplate and continuously stirred at 85 °C for 24 h. Afterwards, the sample was washed using DI water and then filtration was carried out to remove the extra solvent, followed up by oven drying at 110 °C overnight. Prior to its use, vacuum oven drying was also performed at 110 °C for 3 h. 2.2.2 Synthesis of the calcium-based metal organic framework (Ca-MOF) The preparation of the Ca-MOF was carried out by employing a modified hydrothermal method as shown in Fig. 1(b). CaCO3 and BDC (1:1 M) were dissolved in DI water and DMF respectively and sealed in a Teflon autoclave (China), kept in the oven for 48 h at 110 °C [45]. The DMF was used as surfactant and well crystal growth [44,46]. Subsequently, the filtration was performed to remove the extra solvent, followed up by oven drying at 110 °C for 7 h. Prior to its use, vacuum oven drying was also conducted at 110 °C for 3 h."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The crystallography of the prepared catalysts was obtained using XRD analysis. The XRD was performed using Bruker's X-ray Diffractometer (D8 Advance) (Germany), having Cu Kα as the source. The samples were scanned using 2θ from 5° to 70° scanning rate of 0.05° min−1. All the XRD patterns were evaluated using JADE 6.0 and peaks were identified through a match option with built-in JCPDS (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards) or PDF (powder diffraction file) repository of software [47]. The diffraction follows Bragg’s law (Eq. (1)) where n is an integer, λ the wavelength of the light, d is the spacing among crystal planes in the material, and θ is the angle of the incident light. (1) η λ = 2 d sin θ The crystal size of the MOFs were estimated by employing Scherer’s equation (Eq. (2)) [48]. (2) D = 0.9 λ / β cos θ The morphology of the prepared materials was evaluated using SEM and EDX performed in TESCAN VEGA 3 (Czech Republic), operated at 20 kV high voltage with secondary electron detector and tungsten detector type at an angle of 45 °C. The SEM images were taken at three different magnifications of 2 µm, 5 µm and 10 µm for more insights of morphology. TGA was performed to determine the thermal behaviour of synthesized materials using TGA 5500, TA Instruments (USA). The thermograms were taken in a continuous N2 flow of 50 mL min−1 from 20 °C to 800 °C at the heating rate of 5 °C min−1 to assess the percentage (%) weight loss. FTIR was carried out using Cary 630 FTIR Spectrometer, Agilent Technologies (USA). The sample was scanned at a wavelength range of 650–4000 cm−1. The sample was diffused via reflectance method using the ZnSe diffuse reflectance accessory (DRA). The BET analysis for specific surface area, pore volume and size of the synthesized materials were analysed using Quantachrome NOVA 2200e (USA). The samples were vacuum dried at 80 °C for 24 h and degassed for 6 h before the adsorption analysis. The surface area of the samples were determined using the BET absorption curve."
5,Biodiesel production,"2.4 Biodiesel production The two-step esterification and transesterification were taken in three different combinations as follows: (i) The Cu-MOF is used for esterification as the acid catalyst and KOH is used for transesterification process as a standard base catalyst to analyze the biodiesel yield. (ii) The H2SO4 is used as a standard acid catalyst for esterification while Ca-MOF as a base catalyst for transesterification to analyze the biodiesel yield. (iii) Both synthesized heterogeneous catalysts are used; Cu-MOF as an acid catalyst and Ca-MOF as a base catalyst for esterification and transesterification respectively. 2.4.1 Esterification A round bottom flask (250 mL) was mounted on a heating mantle equipped with magnetic stirring and reflux unit to ensure a uniformly agitated reaction mixture. The mixture of WCO (100 mL), methanol and acid catalyst (Cu-MOF) were fed into the flask and the experiment was operated for 60 min of reaction time presented in Fig. 2(a). H2SO4 was selected as a reference and an acidic catalyst for esterification. The sample was collected and centrifuged after the completion of reaction time (60 min). Methanol layer was separated, and substrate was collected for further processing. The substrate was washed with deionized water three times, followed by the removal of water content by heating at 105 °C prior to the transesterification process. 2.4.2 Transesterification The esterified oil was added into the 250 mL flask mounted on a control stirring heating mantle containing the blend of catalyst (Ca-MOF) and methanol demonstrated in Fig. 2 (b). The catalytic activity testing was performed under conditions as presented in Table 1 . The commercial KOH was selected as a reference and as a base catalyst by mixing with methanol to ensure a uniformly agitated reaction mixture before esterified oil is added. The sample was then transferred into a separating funnel to separate synthesised biodiesel and glycerol. The separated biodiesel was washed with DI water in the volume ratio of 1:1 for several times to remove unreacted catalyst and methanol. Excess water content was separated by heating at 105 °C and the final sample of biodiesel was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min at room temperature and subjected to further analysis and characterisation [49]. 2.4.3 Biodiesel yield analysis The compositions of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) in the biodiesel sample was assessed using Shimadzu GCMS-QP2020 NX (Japan). The biodiesel sample (25 mg) was dissolved in n-hexane (0.5 mL) and the subsequent solution is filled in the GC autosampler vial and injected in GC–MS to examine and characterize the FAME composition. The 1.0 µL injection with a split ratio of 10:1 and a set temperature of 150 °C and initial retention time of 5 min for FAME detection. Maximum temperature of 220 °C keeping the ramp of 10 °C min−1 for 15 min retention time. The biodiesel yield (YBD) was analysed using Eq. (3) [24] where the substrate yield to biodiesel is determined in percentage. (3) Y BD ( v o l % ) = B D produced Oi l feed × 100 2.4.4 Biodiesel characterization To compare the biodiesel with ASTM (6751) standards, various parameters and techniques were used such as pH, flashpoint, calorific value, functional groups via FTIR, viscosity, density, specific gravity, saponification value, iodine value and cetane number. The pH of the biodiesel was determined by HI9829 Multiparameter pH/ISE/EC/DO/Turbidity Waterproof Meter (USA), while 3 calibration tests were performed to assure the results. With reference to the literature, controlling the pH at approximately 7.5 is more suitable for biodiesel production [50]. Flashpoint of any fuel is very critical for transportation and storage [51]. The biodiesel samples were tested using Seta flash Series 3 Active Cool Small-Scale Flash Point Tester (UK). Samples were fed into the chamber where the flame was already present. The specific temperature, at which biodiesel sample produces enough vapours to catch the already present flame, is noted for flash point determination. The energy content of a sample represented by calorific value is expressed in joules per kilogram and was determined using 6200 Isoperibol Calorimeter (USA). The 0.5 g sample was kept in the 1108 Oxygen Combustion Bomb at a starting temperature of 21 °C with a rise of 2 °C for further analysis which gave the calorific value of the sample [52]. The absorption spectra of the biodiesel samples were analysed by using the same equipment as for the catalyst. However, since the samples are liquid, the technique employed was attenuated total reflectance method using the 5 bounce ZnSe attenuated total reflectance (ATR) module. 3–5% of the material was mixed with KBr and subjected to FTIR spectrometry. The Brookfield Ametek DV2T Viscometer (USA) was used to determine the viscosity at 25 °C (room temperature) and 150 rpm using 2 mL of the biodiesel sample. A specific volume of the sample was taken and was weighed on the weighing balance to obtain the values of mass and volume so that its density can be calculated. The specific gravity (SG) was calculated using the Eq. (4). (4) SG = ρ sample ρ water The saponification value (SV) is the quantity of KOH (mg) needed to saponify different biodiesel amounts. It is known that the saponification is affected by the oil pre-treatment process. The biodiesel (0.5 g) and 0.5 N alcohol (20 mL) (ethanol) KOH were combined to determine the saponification quality. The mixture was kept in a flask, refluxed and heated at 40 °C until the solution was clear, suggesting a reaction towards saponification. After cooling down the mixture, Phenolphthalein as an indicator to determine colour change and the mixture was titrated to 0.5 N HCl till the pink colour disappears and the SV is calculated as expressed in Eq. (5) [24]. Where B = blank value, S = sample value, N = normality of HCL and W = weight (mg) of biodiesel. (5) SV = B - S × N × 56.1 W To analyse the iodine value, biodiesel (0.1 g) was mixed with the 20 mL of CCL4 in 25 mL Wijs reagent flask. The sample was shaken and placed in the absence of light for 30 min. Then, 20 mL of 15% KI and 100 mL of DI water was added into the reaction one by one. The sample was then titrated against 0.1 N Na2S2O3·5H2O and starch was applied as an indicator. The endpoint was marked by the yellow colour disappearance. The same processes were repeated except for the introduction of biodiesel in order to evaluate the blank and iodine values using Eq. (6). (6) IV = B - S × N × 12.69 W where B = volume (mL) of 0.1 N Na2S2O3·5H2O for blank, S = volume (mL) of 0.1 N Na2S2O3·5H2O for sample (S), N = normality of Na2S2O3·5H2O solution and W = biodiesel weight. The ignition quality of diesel depends on the cetane number which is determined using Eq. (7). (7) CN = 46.3 + 5458 SV - 0.255 × I V"
6,Process optimization using RSM,"2.5 Process optimization using RSM After the initial screening, the better performance catalyst combination (Cu-MO and Ca-MOFs) was included in the optimization process for biodiesel production. The design of experiments (DoE) was employed to investigate the key process parameters in biodiesel production using STATISTICA (Stat. Soft Inc. USA). The central composite design (CCD) was applied to investigate the correlation between independent process variables and the optimum conditions for heterogeneous catalysis of biodiesel production. The process independent variables namely catalyst loading (X1 ) (for both steps), reaction temperature (X2 ) and alcohol to oil volume ratio (X3 ) were selected to check the effect on biodiesel yield (YBD , vol%). Table. 2 presents the details of selected variables and level for the DoE. Each variable consists of three different levels from low (−1) to the centre (0) and to high (1). The CCD with a total of sixteen (16) number of experiments consisting of 2-level full factorial design (23), six-star points, and two replicate centre points is tabulated in Table. 3 . DoE is applied in both esterification and transesterification reactions. The full quadratic models for biodiesel yield (YBD ) were deduced using the methods of least square as expressed in Eq. (8). (8) Y BD = β o + ∑ i = 1 4 β i X i + ∑ i = 1 4 β ii X ii + ∑ i - 1 3 ∑ j = i + 1 4 β ij X i X j where Y BD is the predicting response, whilst X 1, X 2, and X 3 are input process variables. βo is an offset term, while βi , is linear, βii is quadratic and βij represents the interaction coefficients."
7,Catalyst reusability,"2.6 Catalyst reusability The reusability of the catalyst serves a very significant benefit in heterogeneous catalysis. After the esterification and transesterification reactions as stated above, the MOF was recovered using the centrifugation process. After being separated from the reaction mixture, the catalyst was washed several times using ethanol and subsequently with DI water to remove the triglycerides and esters (organic compounds) [53,54]. The recovered catalyst was dried at 110 °C overnight and utilized for biodiesel synthesis using optimized conditions."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Physicochemical analysis of the MOF catalyst,"3.1 Physicochemical analysis of the MOF catalyst XRD was carried out to identify the crystallography of the catalysts. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of Cu-MOF and Ca-MOF and the identified diffraction peaks with hkl indices for Cu-MOF cubical (JCPDS# 74–2329) at 12.1° (1 1 1), 17.2° (0 0 9) and 24.8° (2 1 1) respectively [55–57]. Ca-MOF was detected at (JCPDS# 74-2328) at 9.1° (0 0 3), 18.6° (0 0 6) and 29.3 (1 1 1) respectively. The crystallography properties of Cu-MOF and Ca-MOF are presented in Table 4 . The average crystallite size of 49.0 nm and 20.8 nm for Cu-MOF and Ca-MOF, respectively, is measured. The detected space group for Cu-MOF is Fm-3 m (2 2 5) and Ca-MOF is R-3 m (1 6 6) [45]. Cu-MOF revealed a highly crystalline cubical structure with an average size of approximately 4–8 μm [56,58] as presented in Fig. 4 where three different magnifications i.e. 10 µm (Fig. 4(a)), 5 µm (Fig. 4(b)) and 2 µm (Fig. 4(c)) were investigated. It has been reported that Cu-MOF particles do not possess definite crystal shapes [36,48], while the Cu-MOF sample synthesized in this study showed rectangular sheets with well-defined crystallinity (Fig. 4(c)). The elemental analysis for Cu-MOF is shown in the EDS spectrum (Fig. 4(d)). Reasonably high percentage of Cu (31.74%) was observed. The SEM images of Ca-MOF are illustrated in Fig. 5 (a-c) at three different magnifications i.e. 10 µm, 5 µm and 2 µm. These images showed that the Ca-MOF particles possess cubical shape with an estimated size of 5–7 µm. The small particles aggregated on the cubical particles are the unreacted contents which were later removed by washing [45,59,60]. The EDS spectrum presented in Fig. 5(d) shows the elemental composition of Ca-MOF with 33% of Ca. The TGA of the Cu-MOF were performed at temperatures between 50 and 600 °C where the initial weight loss below 250 °C is ascribed to the removal of moisture content or DMF as presented in Fig. 6 [57]. The further weight loss (35%) until the temperature reaches 400 °C is accompanied by the breakdown of organic linkers of the framework [56,57,61]. Moreover, the weight loss almost remained constant with temperature rise until 600 °C which shows the stability of the catalyst [36,57]. Ca-MOF showed the initial weight loss at 150 °C is again ascribed to the moisture and volatile compounds presented in Fig. 6. The weight loss until the temperature reaches 300 °C can be ascribed to the solvent and DMF removal. Remaining weight loss until the temperature reaches 400 °C is ascribed to the organic linkers and further final degradation of Ca-MOF at 600 °C [45,59]. TGA analysis indicated that the catalyst possesses stability for the process of biodiesel production. The surface functional groups of Cu-MOF were identified via FTIR presented in Fig. 7 (a). Cu-MOF absorption bands obtained at 3163.1 cm−1, 3105.2 cm−1, and 3068.6 cm−1 refer to carbon-hydrogen (C–H) stretching vibrations because of the organic linker (BDC) in the synthesis. Peaks at 2925.9 cm−1 and 1710.2 cm−1 were ascribed to C–H-alkane stretching vibration and CO stretching. The clear peaks at 1116.9 cm−1, 1186.2 cm−1 and 1249.8 cm−1 are associated with C–O stretching vibrations, while the peaks at 544 cm−1 and 579 cm−1 reveal the Cu–O vibrations, which confirm the formation of the Cu-MOF. Fig. 7(b) demonstrates the peaks for Ca-MOF. The peaks at 3000 cm−1 and 1500 cm−1 were conferred to (O–H) and CC stretching. The peak at 600 cm−1 indicates the Ca–O vibrations, which confirms the development of Ca-MOF. In FTIR, two different signals were recorded for the carboxylic group due to the different coordination with metal atoms. When the coordination is high, the stretching frequency shifted to lower frequencies which are recorded for Co-MOF as reported by Banerjee et al. [62]. The MOFs specific surface area (SA) and pore size were calculated using BET. The adsorption isotherms acquired for Cu-MOF and Ca-MOF are shown in Fig. 8 and Table 5 . The isotherms presented in Fig. 8(a) were used to determine the specific surface area of the sample. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms indicate a type IV which is an indication of the successful synthesis of meso/microporous material [20]. On the other hand, the BJH pore size distribution demonstrated the pore radius mostly being <6 nm for both catalyst samples (Fig. 8(b)). The BET surface area of Cu-MOF is 118 m2 g−1. The total pore volume for Cu-MOF is 0.087 cm3g−1 , which is calculated at the maximum relative pressure. The BET surface area for Ca-MOF is 101 m2g-1with pore volume of 0.035 cm3g−1."
10,Catalytic activity testing and biodiesel characterization,"3.2 Catalytic activity testing and biodiesel characterization The WCO to biodiesel was carried out using the synthesized catalyst and analysed using various techniques presented in Fig. 9 and Table 6 with Cu-MOF and Ca-MOF of 78.3 (vol%) and 78 (vol%) respectively. The combination of Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF shows higher biodiesel yield (85 vol%) due to the suitable physiochemical characteristics of the catalyst. The combination of Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF provides the unsaturated open sites that can coordinate with methanol and triglycerides. There are other chemical properties like interface dipole, electron delocalization and nucleophile attack which may assist in the transesterification process [2,63]. Furthermore, the active sites activate the triglycerides in transesterification, which is successfully converted into FAME. The composition of biodiesel is analysed by employing GCMS which indicated the presence of methyl esters (ME). The biodiesel samples synthesized from WCO using Cu-MOF, Ca-MOF and Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF as catalysts contain oleic acid, hexadecenoic acid, linoleic acid, octadecenoic acid and octadecanoic acid as confirmed by the GC–MS analysis. There were minor proportions of various other ME in the samples such as methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, methyl oleate, methyl linoleate methyl linolenate and others. The MEs assure the conversion of FFAs. The content of functional group in biodiesel is affirmed by FTIR (Fig. 10 ). The biodiesel samples with different catalysts, Cu-MOF and Ca-MOF depict the same peaks of C–H and C-O bond functional groups with a slight deviation in ester groups. FTIR spectrum indicates the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of C–H bond on 2930 cm−1 and 2850 cm−1 wave number respectively. The wavenumber at 1740 cm−1 is ascribed to the ester (C = O) bond. The wavenumbers at 1425 cm−1 to 1510 cm−1 were found for C-O stretching in aliphatic organic compounds. In addition, the functional group of ester C-O bond at 1100 cm−1 to 1200 cm−1 were detected respectively. The observations in this work are consistent with the literature [64]. The biodiesel yield produced in correspondence to the amount of substrate used largely depends on the type of feedstock, catalyst loading and other reaction conditions. Hence, the results of biodiesel yield vary with the changes in the process conditions [63]. The yield of biodiesel was 78.3 (vol%) for Cu-MOF, 78 (vol%) for Ca-MOF and 85 (vol%) for Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF heterogeneous catalysts respectively, for the three different catalysts used. The evaluation of synthesised biodiesel samples prepared by using Cu-MOF, Ca-MOF and Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF in the two-steps of esterification and transesterification were further characterized considering the standards provided by ASTM 6751. The characterization was performed by measuring the properties namely pH, flashpoint, caloric value, viscosity, density, specific gravity, saponification value, iodine value and cetane number and were compared with the ASTM standard (ASTM 6751). The flashpoint of biodiesel is higher as compared to that of conventional diesel which makes it safer and a reasonable alternative [65]. The standard value of flashpoint for biodiesel must be 130 °C or higher. Hence in case of Cu-MOF, it is 130 °C while Ca-MOF shows 140 °C and for Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF it is recorded 130.5 °C. The measured flashpoints for biodiesel samples were in good agreement with standard flashpoint value for biodiesel [66]. Biodiesel calorific value is a significant parameter for comparing fuel characteristics with petroleum diesel properties [51]. Biodiesel low power content affects important efficiency parameters such as peak horsepower and torque [67]. The standard calorific value of biodieselis around 37.3 MJkg−1, while the difference in energy density of biodiesel samples depend on the feedstock and production process. The calorific values of samples being reported in this study are 40.1 MJkg−1 for Cu-MOF, 40.2MJkg−1 for Ca-MOF and 40.4 MJkg−1 for Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF which lies in the range of the ASTM (6751) standard [66]. The produced biodiesel viscosity is calculated as 5.0, 5.7 and 5.9 mm2s−1 for Cu-MOF, Ca-MOF and Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF, respectively. The standard value of density for diesel is 848 kgm−3 and for biodiesel is 870– 900 kgm−3 [65]. The density of biodiesel is around ~ 0.88 gcm−3 (870– 900 kgm−3) which is higher than petro-diesel. The density of biodiesel for Cu-MOF is 0.90 gcm−3 and Ca-MOF shows 0.86 gcm−3, while Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF depicts 0.88 gcm−3. Biodiesel density allows the optimized air–fuel ratio for complete combustion in the combustion engine. The specific gravity of biodiesel range was 0.90 for Cu-MOF and 0.86 for Ca-MOF, which fall within the standard range (0.86–0.90). Moreover, the Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF shows a specific gravity of 0.88 which is in the range of ASTM standards (ASTM 6751). The specific gravity of the biodiesel usually relies on the glycerine content and composition of the fatty acid. These samples that are synthesized show an ideal density in reference to the ASTM standard (ASTM 6751) which is suitable for better mileage and energy content [68]. Saponification is a major problem in biodiesel synthesis which causes lower biodiesel yield and poor biodiesel quality [63,69]. The standard saponification value of biodiesel is < 312 mg KOH g−1 while the tested values for Cu-MOF is 252.5, Ca-MOF is 193.4 and Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF is 247.6 mg KOH g−1 respectively. The pre-treatment method of oil can affect the saponification value [24]. WCO contains a large proportion of FFA which are disadvantageous for reaction as alkaline catalysts react with FFA and form soap resulting in the lower yield of biodiesel [70]. By involving the synthesized catalysts (Cu-MOF and Ca-MOF) in the process of esterification and transesterification, enhanced results of saponification values are recorded. The biodiesel degree of unsaturation is measured via iodine number and is therefore useful in investigating oil stability. The high degree of unsaturation showcases polymerization which further led to the creation of epoxy due to the addition of oxygen in dual bonds [20]. The iodine value of Cu-MOF catalysed biodiesel is 60 g I2 / 100 g while Ca-MOF catalysed biodiesel shows a value of 58.5 g I2 / 100 g and Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF shows a value of 61.3 g I2 / 100 g respectively. The given results proved that the stability of synthesized biodiesel is far better as the iodine values are almost half (̴ 60 g I2 / 100 g oil) of the given maximum point (<120 g I2/100 g oil) [66]. The biodiesel cetane number changes on the fuel carbon number and the concentration of FAME. The cetane numbers of Cu-MOF and Ca-MOF are 50 and 48.5 while for Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF it is recorded 52 as presented in Table 6. For the standard range of cetane number, it was found to be 46–52 and 40–55. The results indicate that the prepared samples have an appropriate concentration of FAME and carbon numbers which indicate that the synthesised biodiesel demonstrates better quality. The physical characteristics of the biodiesel sample are quite in accordance with the standard range, showing improved results. However, the percentage yield is not as high as it is for homogenous catalysis but the characteristics such as cost-efficient, regenerative and easy to separate making it more viable than a homogeneous based catalyst [20]. The flashpoint of biodiesel is higher than the set standard of 130 °C which is proven to be safer and able to reduce the unexpected fire hazards as flashpoint yields the lowest temperature to initiate ignition of fuel vapour [71]. In the case of Cu-MOF catalysed biodiesel, it is 10 °C higher than that of Ca-MOF catalysed biodiesel and the combination of both Cu-MOF and Ca-MOF. All the prepared samples of biodiesel give a calorific value > 40 MJkg−1 indicating the good energy content for combustion in the engine. Saponification value higher than 312 mg KOH g−1 of oil leads to soap formation and decreases the yield and quality of biodiesel. The synthesized biodiesel shows low saponification values than the ASTM 6751 standard where the Ca-MOF depicts the least value of 193.4 mg KOHg−1. The biodiesel yield for Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF gave the highest value of 85 (vol%), higher than Cu-MOF and Ca-MOF. It indicates that the combination of acidic and basic nature catalyst enhanced the biodiesel yield in two-step biodiesel synthesis. The optimization analysis using RSM is further continued with the Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF to assess how different independent variables affect the final yield of the sample. The comparison of past literature is presented in Table 7 . The comparison is just to take the idea of the performance of the catalyst presented in this work. The operating parameters are different as most of the studies reported high loading of the catalyst and reaction temperature, while in this work, the catalyst loading is only 1% (1.0 g). Apart from that, the reaction temperature is higher in many cases than this reported work. Hence the provided comparison may draw a baseline to study the reported catalyst for biodiesel production from various sources."
11,Statistical analysis using RSM,"3.3 Statistical analysis using RSM 3.3.1 Analysis of regression model The CCD models for YBD determined by the method of least squares depicted in Table 8 describe the summary of variance analysis. Fig. 11 (a-b) reveals the Pareto-chart and parity-plot for employed regression models for biodiesel yield (YBD). The variability in the YBD (vol%) is expressed in the coefficient of determination (R2) and adjusted R2 [40]. As shown in Table 8, ANOVA is used to analyse the interaction of different independent variables and to figure out the significant values of F, P-value and R2. The F and P-values given in Pareto chart suggest the interaction of linear term of catalyst loading and alcohol-oil ratio (X1X3). Linear interaction of (X2X1) as temperature and catalyst loading also has a significant effect on the YBD (vol%). The quadratic effect of (X3 2) and alcohol-oil ration on YBD (%) show that the methanol content has a vital impact on the conversion of FFAs into FAME [77]. 3.3.2 Effect of the process parameters on biodiesel yield (YBD) The relationship between selected independent variables to result in optimized YBD (vol%) is shown in Fig. 12 . The interaction between reaction temperature and catalyst loading is presented in Fig. 12(a) which demonstrates that the maximum effect of catalyst is experienced between 0.8 and 1.6 g of the catalyst loading correspondingly with the increase in temperature until 60 °C after which the impact starts getting meaningless. The dynamic interaction infers that the high catalyst loading with moderate temperature is useful for YBD which also confirms the catalyst’s participation in the catalytic process [17]. The interaction between catalyst loading (X1) and alcohol-oil ratio (X3) is shown in Fig. 12(b). A very dynamic 2D surface contour can be witnessed where the alcohol has its significant contribution until 60% of YBD while a further increase in alcohol-oil ratio did not enhance the YBD (vol%). The surplus addition of alcohol increases the glycerol solubility and reduces the biodiesel yield [39]. The excess usage may also lead to an increase in the polarity which enhances the glycerol solubility and hard to recover from alkyl ester. Excess addition of alcohol also does not help in YBD (vol%) or good quality biodiesel. Rather, the flashpoint and other fuel properties are being affected [1,78]. However, the catalyst loading shows a significant improvement in YBD (vol%) until around 1.6 g, quite much like its previous interaction with reaction temperature. The surplus quantity of catalyst may lead to the saponification and result in low biodiesel yield. Fig. 12(c) depicts the interaction between reaction temperature (X2) which gives a 2D linear contour increase where after a certain limit, both variables do not show any promising impact on the YBD (vol%). The maximum YBD (vol%) was at 60 °C reaction temperature and 15:100 mL of alcohol. The reaction temperature ought to be set considering the boiling point of alcohol, otherwise, it will evaporate before the reaction completes. Refluxing will take more time, hence their reaction mechanism is obvious with these results [39]. The alcohol-oil ratio is more impactful because increasing the alcohol content provides more methyl groups for biodiesel yield. The empirical model is plotted on the three-dimensional (3D) surface signifying the responses in terms of YBD as a function of two main factors in this experimental range. Fig. 13 illustrates the 3D surface and contour plot for interaction between catalyst loading (X1) and reaction temperature (X2) on YBD (vol%). The catalyst loading shows a major effect on YBD, while the moderate reaction temperature yielded a higher YBD as depicted in Fig. 13 (a). The effect of the catalyst loading is more effective than reaction temperature as the active catalyst effect is more significant than the reaction temperature. The observation can relate to the Arrhenius equation which steady increase in the yield but the catalyst effect reduces the net effect of catalyst reported by Hasni et al. [39]. The very dynamic interaction between X1 and X2 is witnessed in 3D surface plotting which indicates the effectiveness of catalyst performance in this work in low-temperature ranges. High temperature may cause two-phase while vaporising the methanol and decrease the yield. The concentration of the right amount of catalyst can be maintained by performing optimization reactions for a certain type of substrate. Otherwise, it could lead to an incomplete reaction or saponification [71,78]. As discussed above, heterogeneous catalyst [79] is a better option compared to homogenous catalyst owing to the ease of separation from the biodiesel sample. In addition, the heterogeneous catalyst can complete the reaction without major soap formation because of the difference in the state of matter. Moreover, after the optimal temperature, a further increase in temperature initiates the reaction of saponification [80]. The 3D contour plot of interaction between the influence of catalyst loading (X1) and alcohol-Oil ratio (X3) on YBD is illustrated in Fig. 14 . As illustrated in Fig. 13(b), after a certain point, the increase in any of these two variables does not result in any significant response of the YBD. The role of catalyst in any reaction is to provide active sites so that reaction could be performed at more than the normal speed. Hence, evidently, the increase in catalyst loading led to 99% where the increase in the alcohol-oil ratio was less effective in comparison. This is because of the reason that after a certain amount, the excessive quantity of methanol remains unreacted and evaporated in the post-treatment steps of biodiesel sample [81,82]. The interaction of alcohol-oil ratio (X3) and reaction temperature (X2) for YBD (vol% ) is presented in the form of a 3D contour plot in Fig. 15 . When these two variables interact, no significant change in the YBD (vol%) was observed. It has been reported that an increase in the amount of methanol did not improve biodiesel yield pointedly, while moderate temperature enhanced the catalytic activity by providing more active sites for reaction. The increase in temperature decreases the viscosity of oil which helps in improving the reaction kinetics [2]. 3.3.3 Process variables optimization and model validation The process variables were optimized using CCD via RSM based on the biodiesel yield and compared with experimental results presented in Table 9 . The predicted optimum process parameters such as catalyst loading = 1.0 g, reaction temperature = 60 °C and alcohol-oil ratio = 20 respectively. The YBD (%) for these optimum processing parameters is predicted as 84.5%. The desirability of the applied model is 95% for these predicted values [77]. The experiment has been conducted and it was found that YBD = 85%. This value has an error of + 0.8%, much less than the limit of ± 5% error. The stable process performance can be ascribed to the synthesized MOFs having suitable physicochemical properties and better experimental setup."
12,Catalyst recycling performance,"3.4 Catalyst recycling performance The regenerated MOFs were used to assess the catalytic performance under optimized conditions i.e; catalyst loading = 1.0, reaction temperature = 60 °C, alcohol-oil ratio = 20 and reaction time = 60 min presented in Fig. 16 . The first cycle (Cycle 1) shows 80.2% biodiesel yield while in the second cycle (Cycle 2) and third cycle (Cycle 3) 78% and 75.1% biodiesel yield are reported, respectively (Fig. 16). The reduction in the biodiesel yield in heterogeneous catalysis is ascribed to the leaching of the Cu and Ca species [83]. It can also be ascribed to the deposition of the organic species on the surface of the catalyst and block active sites for the catalytic process [53,83]. The absorbed organic molecules may alter the structure of the catalyst as well and subsequently the partial reduction in catalytic activity. It is clear from the recycling practice that MOFs are showing capability for continuous production of biodiesel."
13,Conclusion,"The study concluded with the successful synthesis of Cu-MOF and Ca-MOF catalysts through solvothermal and hydrothermal processes, respectively. The detailed characterization was carried out to identify the crystallography and morphological structures of the synthesized catalyst. XRD results indicate the formation of Cu-MOF and Ca-MOF with crystal size of 49.1 nm and 20.8 nm respectively. SEM images exhibited a cubical shape of 1.5 µm and 2 µm for both Cu-MOF and Ca-MOF catalysts. TGA depicts the thermal stability of Cu-MOF until 400 °C and Ca-MOF until 520 °C which is suitable for the biodiesel synthesis. The synthesized catalysts are then employed for biodiesel production from WCO. The Cu-MOF shows the biodiesel yield of 78.3% while Ca-MOF recorded 78%. The combination of heterogeneous catalyst Cu-MOF + Ca-MOF showcased that 85% of biodiesel yield was better compared to the single combination, making it suitable for further upgradation. The biodiesel characterization further confirms that the synthesized biodiesel meets the ASTM standards in all aspects. Furthermore, RSM based analysis was performed for the purpose of optimization and it was found that the catalyst loading and reaction temperature are most important parameters which affect the biodiesel yield, while alcohol to oil ratio affects the quality of biodiesel. This study can be the baseline for further progress in heterogeneous catalysis validated in the recycling of the catalyst for biodiesel production from WCO on a larger scale."
