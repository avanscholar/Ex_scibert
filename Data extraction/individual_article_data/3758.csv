0,Introduction,"Owing to its environmentally friendly aspect in producing H2, biological H2 production has recently gathered considerable attention. In particular, fermentative hydrogen production (FHP) is considered a promising method, since it is technically simpler and its H2 production rate is much faster than other approaches. In addition, organic pollutants could be degraded along with H2 production (Jung et al., 2010). Till early 2000s, the production of the 1st and 2nd generation biofuels that use edible agricultural crops (sugarcane, sugar beet, wheat, etc.) and lignocellulosic waste biomass (hardwood, softwood, grasses, agricultural residues) as a feedstock, respectively, have been considered an environmentally friendly way. It was estimated that this growth of terrestrial biomass and the replacement of gasoline by bioethanol would significantly reduce the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions (Singh et al., 2010). However, since the mid-2000s, negative opinions concerning land availability and carbon debt by clearing forest and grassland for biofuel production have been voiced (Joseph et al., 2008). Moreover, issues related to demands for irrigation and water-quality problems have also been raised (Robert, 2009). In addition, the existence of lignin in terrestrial biomass has a major impact on economic viability (Mosier et al., 2005). On the basis of above-described issues, aquatic biomass which is now called “the 3rd generation biomass” is paid most attention as the promising alternative renewable sources for biofuel production, (John et al., 2011). First, they can be easily cultivated in the sea at the minimum external energy or water usage, and their productivity is higher than that of tropical rainforests, which exhibit the highest productivity among terrestrial plants (Suzuki et al., 2006). Second, the CO2 capture rate of marine algae is higher than that of terrestrial biomass. For example, Laminaria japonica (4800g C/m2/yr) has more than a twofold higher CO2 utilization rate of tropical rainforests (2000g C/m2/yr) (Park et al., 2008). Lastly, its lignin content is negligible, thus making it easily biodegradable. So far, however, most of studies were focused on producing bioethanol and biodiesel. Scarce researches has been conducted to use 3rd generation biomass for FHP. In densely populated countries such as Korea, the growing of terrestrial crops for biofuel production is not feasible due to the limited land availability and high labor costs. However, using of marine algae seems to be a viable alternative, given that Korea is a peninsular nation. In 2006, the annual production of marine algae was 0.8 million tons in Korea, corresponding to 10% of agricultural byproducts (Park et al., 2008). Upon this research background, the objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of marine algae for FHP. Eight different marine algae including green (Codium fragile), red (Gelidium amansii, Porphyra tennera, Gracilaria verrucosa), and brown (L. japonica, Undaria pinnatifida, Hizikia fusiforme, Ecklonia stolonifera) algae were selected for study. It was found that L. japonica possessed the highest H2 production potential, and thus, in subsequent experiments, thermal-pretreatment was applied only to Laminaria japonica for enhanced H2 production."
1,Methods,
2,Seed sludge and feedstock preparation,"2.1 Seed sludge and feedstock preparation The seed sludge was taken from an anaerobic digester in a local wastewater treatment plant. The pH, alkalinity, and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of the sludge were 7.8, 4.78g CaCO3/L, and 3.8g/L, respectively. It was heat-treated at 90°C for 20min to inactivate non-H2 producing bacteria and to harvest spore-forming anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium sp. (Jung et al., 2010). The marine algae tested were green (C. fragile), red (G. amansii, P. tennera, G. verrucosa), and brown algae (L. japonica, U. pinnatifida, H. fusiforme, E. stolonifera), which are intensively cultivated in the world (FAO, 2009; Park et al., 2008). Prior to fermentation, they were washed using fresh water to remove preexisting salt, sand, etc., and then dried in an oven (105°C). Subsequently, they were ground to below 0.5mm particle size with a knife-milling Waring commercial blender. The characteristics of each feedstock are given in Table 1 ."
3,Batch test,"2.2 Batch test In batch test I, all marine algae were tested for FHP without pretreatment. The batch fermenter with a working volume of 3.0L (380mm high by 135mm ID) was seeded with the heat-pretreated sludge, equivalent to 30% of the working volume, and filled with a certain amount of untreated marine algae and tap water. There was no addition external nutrient. Substrate concentration was fixed at 20g chemical oxygen demand (COD)/L. N2 gas was purged in order to provide an anaerobic condition. By using a pH sensor and pH controller, initial pH was adjusted at 8.0±0.1 with 3N KOH addition, and pH maintained above 5.5±0.1 during fermentation (Jung et al., 2010). Batch test II was performed to compare the H2 productivity of alginate, laminarin, agar, and carrageenan, which were the major polysaccharides constituting brown and red algae. Each were added to the fermenter at a concentration of 5g/L. Nutrients and trace metals were supplemented as described by Kim et al. (2009). Operational strategy was the same with the Batch test I. In the Batch tests III and IV, thermally pretreated L. japonica was used as a feedstock at a substrate concentration of 20g COD/L. Thermal pretreatment was conducted in a 5 L stainless steel reactor at various temperatures (Batch test III: 150, 160, 170, and 180°C for 20min), and heating times (Batch test IV: 170°C for 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40min). During the pretreatment, the S (solid)/L (liquid) ratio was fixed at 1:12. After pretreatment, the concentrations of TCOD, SCOD, cellulose, hemicellulose, glucose, xylose, and furfural were measured. The reactor and experimental procedure were the same as those used for Batch test I. Batch tests I, III and IV were conducted in a temperature controlled room at 35±1°C, and all batch experiments were carried out in triplicate."
4,Biogas production analysis,"2.3 Biogas production analysis Measured biogas production was adjusted to the standard conditions of temperature (0°C) and pressure (760mm Hg) (STP). To describe the H2 production, cumulative H2 production curve was described by the modified Gompertz Eq. (1) (Lay et al., 1999). (1) H ( t ) = P · exp - exp R ′ · e P ( λ - t ) + 1 , where H(t)=cumulative H2 production (L) at cultivation time t (h); P =ultimate H2 production (L); R′ =H2 production rate (L/L/h); λ =lag phase (h); and e =exp(1)=2.71828. H2 production was calculated from the headspace measurements of gas composition and the total volume of biogas produced at each time interval using the mass balance Eq. (2). (2) V H 2 , i = V H 2 , i - 1 + V W C H 2 , i + V G , i C H 2 , i - V G , i - 1 C H 2 , i - 1 , where V H 2 , i and V H 2 , i - 1 are the volumes of cumulative hydrogen (mL) calculated after the ith and the previous measurement; V W is the total gas volume measured by the water displacement method (mL); C H 2 , i is the concentration of H2 gas in the total gas measured by the water displacement method (%); V G , i and V G , i - 1 are the volumes of the gas in the headspace of the bottle for the ith and the previous measurement (mL); C H 2 , i and C H 2 , i - 1 are the percent H2 in the headspace of the bottle for the ith and the previous measurement. (Argun et al., 2008)."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods H2 content in the biogas was determined by a gas chromatography (GC, Cow Mac series 580) using a thermal conductivity detector and a 1.8m×3.2mm stainless-steel column packed with molecular sieve 5A with N2 as a carrier gas. The contents of CH4, N2, and CO2 were measured using a GC of the same model noted previously with a 1.8m×3.2mm stainless-steel column packed with porapak Q (80/100 mesh) using helium as a carrier gas. The temperatures of injector, detector, and column were kept at 80, 90, and 50°C, respectively, in both GCs. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs, C2–C6) and lactic acid were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Finnigan Spectra SYSTEM LC, Thermo Electron Co.) with an ultraviolet (210nm) detector (UV1000, Thermo Electron) and an 100×7.8mm Fast Acid Analysis column (Bio-Rad Lab.) using 0.005M H2SO4 as a mobile phase. Aliphatic alcohol was determined using another HPLC (DX-600, Dionex) with an electrochemical detector (ED50A, Dionex) and a 250×9mm IonPac ICE-ASI column (Dionex) using 50mM HClO4 as a mobile phase. The liquid samples were pretreated with a 0.45μm membrane filter before injection to both HPLC. Sucrose concentration was determined by the colorimetric method of Dubois et al. (1956). COD, total solids (TS), and VSS were measured according to Standard Methods (APHA, 1998). Cell compound, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents were analyzed according to the Agriculture Handbook (Goering and Van Soest, 1970). Glucose, xylose and furfural concentration were analyzed by modified phenol–sulfuric acid method (Rao and Pattabiraman, 1989)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,H2 production from untreated marine algae,"3.1 H2 production from untreated marine algae Fig. 1 shows the cumulative H2 production from untreated marine algae. The fermentation ended within 80h, and CH4 was not detected for the whole experimental period. Notably, a large amount of H2 was produced from L. japonica, but a little from H. fusiforme and P. tenera. It was difficult to ascertain the reasons of the different H2 production potential among various marine algae, but several factors may be considered. Table 1 lists the nutrient composition and H2 yield (mL H2/g CODadded) from various marine algae. As it is well known that the H2 production potential of carbohydrate is much higher than that of lipid and protein, the different carbohydrate content could be one of the reasons for different H2 production (Lay et al., 2003; Dong et al., 2009). L. japonica has relatively high carbohydrate content of 60%, while H. fusiforme and P. tenera have less than 40%. However, in spite of high carbohydrate content of 61%, the H2 yield of G. amansii was limited to 34.2mL H2/g CODadded. The carbohydrate content of C. fragile and G. verrucosa was less than 35%, but their H2 yield reached roughly 50mL H2/g CODadded. As the cell wall should first be broken down for microbial contact of polysaccharides inside the cell, the rigidity of the cell wall could be a key factor for FHP. Also, the constituents of polysaccharides may affect the H2 yield. A few researches have conducted on the structure of the cell wall of marine algae, but information on their biodegradability is limited. It has been reported that the cell wall of marine algae have a similar basic structure of randomly arranged microfibirls embedded in an amorphous matrix (Cronshaw et al., 1958). The constituents of bio-polymers in marine algae significantly differ from those of terrestrial biomass, and also vary with species. The major polysaccharides of green algae are sulphated xyloarabinogalactans such as xylans and mannans, which serve as partially crystalline skeletal components, as in the hemicellulose of land plants, providing additional strength (Elizabeth, 1979). On the other hand, the main polysaccharides of brown algae are alginates, laminarin, and mannitol (Andrade et al., 2004), and agar and carrageenan for red algae (Whyte and Englar, 1981). The biodegradability of each component has not been fully investigated to date, but laminarin and carrageenan are known as rather biodegradable materials while agar is not. The objective of batch test II was to compare the H2 productivity of various polysaccharides, including alginate, laminarin, agar, and carrageenan, the major polysaccharides constituting brown and red algae (Fig. 2 ). It was found that alginate and laminarin possessed the higher yields of 8.28mL H2/g substrate and 4.62mL H2/g substrate, respectively, which can be linked to the highest H2 yield being achieved from L. japonica. L. japonica is mainly composed of alginate and laminarin. Meanwhile, agar and carrageenan showed relatively lower values, indicating that red algae are not a suitable feedstock for FHP. Also, L. japonica showed higher degradation rate than others, resulting in the largest production of organic acids (Fig. 3 ). Total organic acid concentration reached around 8000mg COD/L with L. japonica, while 2000–6000mg COD/L with other plants. The main organic acids were acetic acid and butyric acid, which are generally found as by-products in the normal FHP process (Pattra et al., 2008). As shown in Table 2 , the H2 yield of untreated L. japonica obtained in this study was much higher than that of untreated lignocellulosic biomass (Table 2), which could be attributed to the negligible lignin content in this marine alga. The yield was even similar to that of the pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. There have been two reports that using microalgae as a feedstock for FHP (Yan et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010), but the yield was limited to less than 20mL H2/g CODadded. This clearly indicates that marine algae, especially L. japonica could be a feasible feedstock for FHP. In addition, L. japonica is well grown biomass, which can be harvested three times a year in Korea, producing 0.2 million tons annually."
8,Effect of thermal pretreatment temperature,"3.2 Effect of thermal pretreatment temperature In order to enhance the H2 production potential of L. japonica, thermal pretreatment was applied. Table 3 shows the changes of solubilization, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents, as well as the concentrations of glucose, xylose, and furfural in the liquid phase after thermal pretreatment at different temperatures. The solubilization was defined as the ratio of SCOD/TCOD, which was increased with increasing pretreatment temperature. The contents of cellulose and hemicellulose decreased, whereas the contents of cell compounds and the concentrations of glucose and xylose increased. These findings all reflect the hydrolyzing process of L. japonica. Furfural, which has an inhibitory effect on microbial metabolism, was observed with pretreatment. Furfural is generally known to be made from lignin, but it also can be formed from glucose and xylose under the severe conditions of pretreatment (Datar et al., 2007). When the pretreatment temperature was increased over 170°C, furfural concentration increased along with decreases of glucose and xylose. Fig. 4 and Table 5 show the cumulative H2 production profiles and the average gas/liquid phase parameters in a batch study using thermally pretreated L. japonica at various temperatures, respectively. By pretreatment, H2 production was significantly increased, showing a maximum H2 yield of 110.8±0.4mL H2/g CODadded at 170°C. Also, the H2 production rate (R′) obtained by the modified Gompertz equation, and carbohydrate removal increased to 80%. The drop of H2 production at 180°C might have resulted from conversion of sugar to furfural, which was inhibitory to H2 production. The major liquid by-products were butyric acid followed by acetic acid at the optimal condition."
9,Effect of thermal pretreatment time,"3.3 Effect of thermal pretreatment time The last batch test was conducted to identify the effect of thermal pretreatment time (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40min). On the basis of previous results, the temperature in the pretreatment was fixed at 170°C. As shown in Table 4 , the SCOD/TCOD ratio increased, while the contents of cellulose and hemicellulose decreased with pretreatment time. However, the concentrations of glucose (3550mg/L) and xylose (2840mg/L) were peaked at 20min, resulting in the highest H2 yield of 109.6±0.3mL H2/g CODadded (Table 5). Further increase of pretreatment time longer than 20min brought about a loss of glucose and xylose, respectively, but furfural increased, resulting in the decrease of H2 production (Fig. 5 ). Lag period was also increased to 14h when pretreated longer than 30min. The calculation of net energy gain is essential to estimate the cost-benefit of biogas production system. According to the simple calculation of Perera et al. (2010), the amount of increased H2 production by thermal pretreatment (170°C for 20min) corresponds to the energy gain increase by 0.57kJ/g COD. However, undoubtedly, thermal pretreatment would be an economic burden. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use waste heat or to obtain more energy from the H2 fermentation effluent to compensate the energy required for pretreatment. Our future work would be focused on developing a two-stage fermentation process that sequentially converting L. japonica to H2 and CH4."
10,Conclusions,"In the present study utilizing marine algae as substrates for FHP, the following conclusions were drawn. (1) From the eight different kind of marine algae tested, L. japonica showed the highest H2 yield of 69.1mL H2/g CODadded that was even higher than that of pretreated terrestrial lignocellulosic biomass. This can be attributed to the negligible content of lignin in marine algae. (2) In order to enhance the H2 production potential of L. japonica, thermal pretreatment was applied at various temperatures (150–180°C) and time (5–40min). As pretreatment strength increased, solubilization increased and the contents of cellulose, and hemicellulose decreased. However, H2 production was not accordingly increased due to losses of glucose and xylose, and increased furfural production. (3) The highest H2 yield of 109.6mL H2/g CODadded was achieved from the Laminaria japonica pretreated at 170°C for 20min along with the largest production of organic acids."
