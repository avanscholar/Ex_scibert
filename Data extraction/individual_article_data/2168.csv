0,Introduction,"Since the first report of electrochemical water splitting to hydrogen using TiO2 by Honda and Fujishima in 1972 [1], extensive efforts have been devoted to photocatalytic hydrogen production using TiO2-based semiconductor photocatalysts as a promising method for solar energy conversion and storage [2–4]. TiO2 mainly exhibits anatase and rutile crystalline phase, and anatase TiO2 shows superior photocatalytic properties probably due to the larger specific surface area and moderate ability to suppress the recombination of photogenerated carriers [5,6]. Facets (crystal planes) exposed on an oxide particle strongly affect optical, electronic, and catalytic properties. Recently, facet-engineered oxide nanocrystals catalysts and photocatalysts have been reported to exhibit facet-dependent catalytic and photocatalytic properties [7–9]. {0 0 1}, {1 0 0} and {1 0 1} facets are the three fundamental facets of anatase TiO2 crystal. Since Yang and co-workers reported the synthesis of anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with dominant {0 0 1} facet of high surface energy [10], photocatalytic activity of anatase TiO2 with different exposed facets have been intensively investigated [11–14]. Pan et al. reported a cooperative mechanism of surface atomic structure and surface electronic structure that determines photoreactivity of anatase TiO2 facets [15]. Teng et al. reported higher photocatalytic hydrogen production activity and recyclability of Pt@CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst using TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {0 0 1} facets than using TiO2 nanorods with exposed {1 0 1} facets [16]. Zhang et al. found that anatase TiO2 {0 0 1} facets were superior in compositing with Bi4Ti3O12, Bi2WO6 and WS2 as photocatalysts than anatase TiO2 {1 0 1} facets [17]. Copper oxides (CuOx) is widely used a non-noble metal co-catalyst to enhance the photocatalytic activity of anatase TiO2 photocatalyst. TiO2 phase structures and copper oxidation states of CuOx/TiO2 photocatalyst were reported to strongly affect CuOx-TiO2 interaction and photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production from water reduction [18–20]. Highly dispersed Cu2O was identified as the active copper species in CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts under solar light irradiation [21–23]. Furthermore, Cu2O in contact with anatase TiO2 was found to exhibit appropriate interfacial interaction and excellent photocatalytic activity under solar illumination [24]. Liu et al. reported in-situ loading of ultra-small Cu2O particles and other transition metal oxide clusters on anatase TiO2-{0 0 1} nanosheets as composite photocatalysts with enhanced photocatalytic performance [25,26]. However, systematic and comparative studies have been rarely reported on facet-dependent CuOx-anatase TiO2 interaction and photocatalytic properties of CuOx/anatase TiO2 composite photocatalysts. In this paper, CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts using anatase TiO2 nanocrystals exposing different facets, including TiO2-{0 0 1}, TiO2-{1 0 0} and TiO2-{1 0 1}, were prepared and examined as photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production in methanol/water solution under simulated solar light. Strong TiO2 facet effects were observed, and CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} photocatalyst exhibited Cu2O-anatase TiO2 heterojunctions with the strongest interaction that promoted charge separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes, leading to the highest photocatalytic H2 production."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials synthesis,"2.1 Materials synthesis All chemical reagents (A. R. grade) were purchased from Sinopharm and used as received. Anatase TiO2-{0 0 1}, TiO2-{1 0 0} and TiO2-{1 0 1} nanocrystals were prepared by a hydrothermal method as reported in our previous work [27]. CuOx/TiO2 catalysts with a fixed 1.2%wt calculated Cu loading were synthesized via an incipient wetness impregnation method employing TiO2-{0 0 1}, TiO2-{1 0 0} and TiO2-{1 0 1} as the supports. Typically, 0.5 g TiO2 powder was impregnated with appropriate concentration of Cu(NO3)2 aqueous solution under ultrasonication for 1 h at room temperature and then dried at 80 °C overnight. The powder samples were then calcined at 400 °C at a static air atmosphere in a muffle furnace for 2 h. The acquired composite samples were labeled as CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1}, CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} and CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1}."
3,Structure characterizations,"2.2 Structure characterizations The sample composition was analyzed by an Optima 7300DV inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were measured with a Beckman Coulter SA3100 surface area analyzer, and the sample was degassed at 300 °C for 5 h in a N2 atmosphere prior to the measurement. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Philips X’Pert Pro Super diffractometer in the range 20–80° with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) operated at 40 kV and 50 mA. The visible Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature with a HORIBA LabRAM HR confocal microscope spectrograph with a spectral resolution of 0.6 cm−1 and excitation lines at 514 nm. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using monochromatized Al Kα (hν = 1486.7 eV) as the excitation source, and the likely charging of samples was corrected by setting the binding energy of the adventitious carbon (C 1s) to 284.8 eV. UV–vis diffused reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) were obtained on a Shimadzu DUV-3700 spectrophotometer with BaSO4 as the reflectance standard. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded at 130 K on a JEOL JES-FA200 EPR spectrometer (9.063 GHz, X-band) with employed microwave power, modulation frequency, and modulation amplitude of 0.998 mW, 100 kHz, and 0.35 mT respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were performed on a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Steady-state photoluminescence spectra were measured on a HORIBA LabRAM HR spectrograph with a continuous wave 325 nm laser as the exciting source and the signal was collected by passing through a filter with cut-off wavelengths below 380 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were measured on a steady-state/lifetime FLS-920 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.) with the excitation wavelength of 368 nm and the monitoring wavelength of 516 nm. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were carried out on a Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2750, in which 30 mg catalyst was heated at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a 5% H2/Ar mixture with a flow rate of 20 mL/min. Operando Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements of CO adsorption were performed on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with an in-situ DRIFTS reaction cell (Harrick Scientific Products, INC) and a MCT/A detector with 64 scans and a resolution of 4 cm−1. The reaction cell filled with catalysts (50 mg) was evacuated to 0 Pa and the catalysts were then cooled by liquid nitrogen to 123 K whose spectrum was taken as the background spectrum. Then CO was admitted into the reaction cell via a leak valve stream passed the reaction cell controlled the pressure from 0 Pa to 300 Pa with flowmeter, the DRIFTS spectrum recorded after CO adsorption reached the steady state."
4,Photocatalytic activity evaluation,"2.3 Photocatalytic activity evaluation Photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments (Experiments in photocatalytic water reduction to produce hydrogen) were performed in a top-irradiation Pyrex flask. A 300 W simulated solar light (full wavelength 300–1100 nm) (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Trusttech Co., Ltd.) was used as the light source. Typically, 50 mg photocatalysts were dispersed in 120 mL 20% volume methanol aqueous solution under magnetic stirring. Prior to the irradiation, the reaction mixture was deaerated repeatedly with Ar gas for 50 min to thoroughly remove air and dissolved oxygen. A cooling-water jacket was used to keep the photocatalytic reaction temperature at 25 °C. To evaluate the photocatalytic hydrogen production, the gas-phase composition of the photocatalytic reactor was analyzed every hour by extracting 0.5 mL gas into a GC-14C gas chromatograph equipped with a column of 5 Å molecular sieves and employing the Ar carrying gas."
5,Results and discussion,"As shown in Table 1 , all CuOx/TiO2 composite photocatalysts show similar Cu loadings, as analyzed by ICP-AES. The measured specific surface areas (Table 1) demonstrate that CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} exhibits a much smaller specific surface area than TiO2-{0 0 1} while CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1} and CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} exhibit slightly-decreased specific surface areas than TiO2 nanocrystals. Fig. 1 shows TEM and HRTEM images of TiO2 nanocrystals and CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts. TEM images of anatase TiO2-{0 0 1} (Fig. 1 A1), TiO2-{1 0 1} (Fig. 1 B1) and TiO2-{1 0 0} nanocrystals (Fig. 1 C1) are similar to previous reports [27]. Their morphologies do not change after the loading of CuOx (Fig. 1 A2–C2), indicating that CuOx loading and calcination at 400 °C exert little influence on the facets exposed on TiO2 supports. HRTEM images of CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts (Fig. 1 A3–C3) identify a lattice spacing about 0.21 nm arising from Cu2O (1 0 0) crystals plane in addition to lattice spacing of anatase TiO2. All observed Cu2O nanoparticles are finer than 5 nm. Fig. 2 A and B display XRD patterns of TiO2 nanocrystals and CuOx/TiO2 composite photocatalysts respectively. Only diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 25.3, 37.9, 38.5, 48.1, 53.9, 55.1 and 62.7° were observed in all samples and could be assigned to the (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (1 1 2), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 1 1) and (2 0 4) crystal planes of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS Card No. 21-1272) [5]. No evident shift in the diffraction peaks of TiO2 could be observed after CuOx loading, excluding the likely incorporation of copper cations into the lattice of TiO2. The absence of diffraction peaks related to Cu or CuOx could be due to the low copper loadings and the high dispersions of resultant copper species. The average crystallite sizes of anatase TiO2 in TiO2 and CuOx/TiO2 samples were estimated from the Scherer equation employing the anatase (1 0 1) diffraction peak. The results summarized in Table 1. The average crystallite size of TiO2 increases from 12.7 nm for TiO2-{0 0 1} obviously to 17.5 nm for CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} while TiO2 in CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1} and CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} exhibits similar average crystallite sizes to that in corresponding TiO2 nanocrystals. These observations are consistent with the above results of specific surface areas, suggesting that TiO2-{0 0 1} nanocrystals are not so stable as TiO2-{1 0 1} and TiO2-{1 0 0} nanocrystals and aggregate during the synthesis of CuOx/TiO2 composite photocatalysts due to the high surface energy of TiO2-{0 0 1} facets. Fig. 2C and D respectively show visible laser Raman spectra of TiO2 nanocrystals and CuOx/TiO2 composite photocatalysts. All samples only exhibit vibrational bands at 144, 197, 395, 515 and 637 cm−1, typical Raman-active vibrational modes for anatase TiO2. The peak at 637 cm−1 is stronger relative to other peaks for TiO2-{0 0 1} and CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} than for other samples due to their higher percentages of exposed {0 0 1} facets [28,29]. It can be seen that the relative intensity of the peak 637 cm−1 to other peaks decreases from TiO2-{0 0 1} to CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1}. This suggests that the aggregation of TiO2-{0 0 1} during the synthesis of CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} should decrease the percentage of exposed {0 0 1} facets. Although XRD and Raman spectroscopy fail to detect copper signals in CuOx/TiO2 samples, UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra of these samples (Fig. 3 ) identify presences of CuOx species. In addition to a sharp increase in the absorbance at around 400 nm due to the band gap of anatase TiO2, CuOx/TiO2 samples exhibit broad absorption bands at 400–550 nm arising from Cu2O and enhanced absorption bands in the range of 600–800 nm due to d–d transition of Cu2+ or the intrinsic exciton band of CuO clusters [30–32]. All CuOx/TiO2 samples showed similar absorption edge to TiO2 nanocrystals, but the absorption intensity of visible light up to 800 nm follows an order of CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0}. Surface compositions and structures of CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts were characterized by XPS (Fig. 4 ). No significant shift was observed between Ti 2p binding energies of TiO2 nanocrystals and CuOx/TiO2 samples (Fig. 4A and B). In the Cu 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 4C), a single Cu 2p component with its Cu 2p3/2 binding energy at approximately 932.7 eV was observed for all CuOx/TiO2 samples and could be assigned to Cu2O species [18,24], while a characteristic shake-up satellite peak of CuO at 942.7 eV was absent. This demonstrates that the dominant surface copper species is Cu2O in all CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts. Previous studies demonstrated that the copper species of CuOx/TiO2 composites sensitively depended on preparation conditions [33–35] and a low calcination temperature favored the formation of Cu2O species [36–38]. By comparing the normalized Cu 2p XPS peak intensities (Table 1), the amounts of Cu2O on the surface of various CuOx/TiO2 samples were found to follow an order of CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1} ≈ CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0}. CO adsorption at 123 K probed with in situ DRIFTS spectroscopy was further used to characterize surface compositions and structures of TiO2 and CuOx/TiO2 samples (Fig. 5 ). CO adsorption on TiO2-{0 0 1}, TiO2-{1 0 0} and TiO2-{1 0 1} surfaces gives strong vibrational feature at 2181 cm−1, 2181 cm−1 and 2179 cm−1, which could be assigned to CO(a) adsorbed at the Ti5c sites of TiO2. In addition, tiny peaks of CO(a) at defective Ti4c sites and 13CO(a) at the Ti5c sites could also be identified at 2215–2220 and 2129–2132 cm−1 respectively [39]. The loading of CuOx on TiO2 nanocrystals exerts morphology-dependent variations in the DRIFTS spectra of CO(a) species at the Ti sites. The loading of CuOx on TiO2-{0 0 1} significantly enhances the vibrational features of CO(a) at both Ti5c and Ti4c sites, and both CO(a) features red-shifted slightly. The loading of CuOx on TiO2-{1 0 1} weakens the vibrational feature of CO(a) at the Ti5c sites but seldom affects that at the Ti4c sites. The loading of CuOx on TiO2-{1 0 0} does not change the vibrational feature of CO(a) at the Ti5c sites, but strengthens the vibrational feature of CO(a) at the Ti4c sites. CO adsorption on Cu2O surfaces gives vibrational feature at ∼2129 and ∼2115 cm−1 which can be respectively assigned to CO(a) adsorbed at perimeter Cu(I) sites of Cu2O-TiO2 interfaces and Cu (I) sites of Cu2O. It was previously reported that the strong interaction between Cu2O and TiO2 resulted in the perimeter Cu ions with more positive charges that Cu(I) of Cu2O and subsequent blue shift in the vibrational feature of adsorbed CO [40]. Although the vibrational features of CO(a) adsorbed at perimeter Cu(I) sites is also contributed by those of 13CO(a) at the Ti5c sites, the vibrational features of CO(a) at Cu(I) sites of CuOx/TiO2 catalysts obviously depend on the TiO2 morphology. CO(a) adsorbed at perimeter Cu(I) sites dominates in CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} and the fraction of CO(a) adsorbed at perimeter Cu(I) sites follows an order of CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1}. This suggests that the dispersion of Cu2O is highest and the Cu2O-TiO2 interaction is strongest in CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} catalyst among all CuOx/TiO2 catalysts. The loading of CuOx on TiO2, on one hand, will cover parts of TiO2 surfaces and decrease the accessible surface Ti sites for CO adsorption, and on the other hand, will likely create additional surface Ti sites at CuOx-TiO2 perimeters for CO adsorption by CuOx-TiO2 interaction. On the basis of above CO adsorption results, both Ti5c and Ti4c surface sites created at the CuOx-TiO2-{0 0 1} perimeters are more than those buried by CuOx in CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} catalyst, the Ti5c surface sites created at the CuOx-TiO2-{1 0 0} perimeters are similar to those buried by CuOx in CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} catalyst while the Ti4c surface sites created at the CuOx-TiO2-{1 0 0} perimeters are much more than those buried by CuOx, and the Ti5c surface sites created at the CuOx-TiO2-{1 0 1} perimeters are much less than those buried by CuOx in CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1} catalyst while the Ti4c surface sites created at the CuOx-TiO2-{1 0 1} perimeters are slightly more than those buried by CuOx. These results are consistent with the order of the perimeter Cu(I) sites and Cu2O dispersion among all CuOx/TiO2 catalysts (CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1}). The presence of Cu(II) in CuOx/TiO2 samples is evidenced by UV–vis spectra, but not by either XPS or HRTEM. EPR is sensitive for probing paramagnetic Cu(II) species. Fig. 6 shows EPR spectra of TiO2 nanocrystals and CuOx/TiO2 samples. All TiO2 nanocrystals exhibit the features of g = 2.022–2.026 and g = 2.004–2.008 arising from the O2 − species and the oxygen vacancy with one electron (F1+ color center) respectively [27]. The O2 − species is likely formed by adsorption of oxygen at surface oxygen vacancies of TiO2 under an ambient condition. Moreover, an additional signal of g = 1.968 could be observed and assigned to the paramagnetic Ti3+ species for TiO2-{1 0 1} and TiO2-{1 0 0} nanocrystals [41–43]. In the EPR spectra of CuOx/TiO2 samples, a broad and pronounced peak at g = 2.115 appears for all samples and can be assigned to small-sized CuO on TiO2 surfaces in which the long range dipolar coupling (dipole-dipole interactions) occur between Cu2+ ions [44–46]; meanwhile, the Ti3+ species also exist in the CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1} and CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} samples. Thus, original O2 − species and F1+ color centers on TiO2 nanocrystals get consumed upon the loading of CuOx, but original Ti3+ species does not. It is reasonable that CuOx preferentially nucleates at surface oxygen vacancies of TiO2 nanocrystals. The Cu2+ EPR peaks were integrated to relatively compare their amounts in CuOx/TiO2 samples. The results (Table 1) demonstrate that the relative Cu2+ amount follows an order of CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} < CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} < CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1}. The above comprehensive characterization results demonstrate TiO2 morphology-dependent CuOx speciation and structures in CuOx/TiO2 samples, suggesting TiO2 morphology-dependent CuOx-TiO2 interactions. H2-TPR is a powerful technique to probe metal-support interactions. Fig. 7 A shows H2-TPR profiles of TiO2 nanocrystals and CuOx/TiO2 samples. TiO2 nanocrystals exhibit little reducibility below 500 °C, thus the observed H2 consumption peaks in the H2-TPR profiles of CuOx/TiO2 samples in the range of 150–400 °C should correspond to the reduction of copper oxides. According to the literature and our previous results [24,47,48], the H2 reduction peaks associated with highly dispersed CuO, Cu2O species and bulk CuO crystallites supported on oxides appear in turn with the increase of temperature in the H2-TPR profile. Due to the lack of bulk CuO crystallites in CuOx/TiO2 catalysts evidenced by XRD, the low and high H2 reduction peaks could be attributed to the reductions of highly dispersed CuO and Cu2O species respectively. The reduction temperatures of both highly dispersed CuO and Cu2O species in CuOx/TiO2 catalysts follow an order of CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1}, demonstrating that the CuOx-TiO2-{0 0 1} interaction is strongest while the CuOx-TiO2-{1 0 1} interaction is weakest. The H2 consumption peak of highly dispersed CuO species follows an order of CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} > CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1}, suggesting that the relative Cu2+ amount follows an order of CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} < CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} < CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1}, in consistence with the above EPR results. The H2 consumption peak of Cu2O species follows an order of CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1}, suggesting that the relative amount of Cu2O species follows an order of CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1} < CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} < CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} (Fig. 7B). Combined with the XPS results, it indicated that parts of Cu1+ ions existed in the bulk when having the similar total copper loading contents for various CuOx/TiO2 samples. However, compared to CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} sample, CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1} has a lower total amount of Cu2O but with a similar surface population from XPS result, which may due to the high BET specific surface area. Fig. 8 A shows photocatalytic performances of TiO2 nanocrystals and CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts in photocatalytic H2 evolution in methanol/water solution illuminated by Xe lamp. Table 1 summarizes calculated weight-specific and surface-specific H2 yields of various samples. Herein we use surface area-specific photocatalytic H2 production to compare the photocatalytic activity among various photocatalysts [49]. The bare TiO2-{0 0 1}, TiO2-{1 0 1} and TiO2-{1 0 0} nanocrystals exhibit low surface area-specific photocatalytic H2 production rates of 0.09, 0.13 and 0.06 μmol h−1 m−2 for TiO2-{0 0 1}, TiO2-{1 0 1} and TiO2-{1 0 0} respectively. A loading of 1.2 wt% CuOx on TiO2 greatly enhances the photocatalytic activity, and CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} exhibits both the highest surface area-specific photocatalytic H2 production rate of 8.96 μmol h−1 m−2 and the highest weight-specific photocatalytic H2 production rate of 621 μmol h−1 g−1 (Table 1). Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 8C, the enhancement effect of CuOx on photocatalytic activity of TiO2 follows an order of CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1}, and the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} reaches 99.6 times of that TiO2-{0 0 1} nanocrystals. Recycle measurement of the photocatalytic activity was also performed under the same condition by evacuating the prior to each cycle of measurement for CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} photocatalyst. The result of the recycle measurements in Fig. 8D further proves the stability of our CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts in the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction. Compared with other studies on CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts under simulated solar light irradiation for hydrogen generation, Degussa P25, a commercial TiO2 support is considered as a benchmark model catalyst and CuOx/P25 photocatalysts widely studied in literatures. for example, 1%wt CuOx/P25 in our previous report showed the photocatalytic H2 yield of 3203 μmol h−1 g−1 and 87.51 μmol h−1 m−2 respectively[24], Cu2O/P25 heterostructure nanoparticle were prepared with a 1%Cu loading and reached 668.4 μmol/h/g hydrogen production from 20% ethanol aqueous solutions by Xi et al. [50], Jung et al. reported 0.5 wt% CuOx/P25 photocatalyst prepared by impregnation reached a 1134 μmol/h/g hydrogen production rate from 10% methanol solution [36]. Li et al. prepared Cu2O/P25 photocatalyst obtained 2048.25 μmol/h/g photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution in 10% methanol aqueous solutions under UV–vis light irradiation and CuO/P25 sample used chemical adsorption decomposition method which reached 3155.7 μmol/h/g hydrogen evolution rate in 10% methanol aqueous solutions under visible light irradiation [51,52]. These CuOx/P25 photocatalyst exhibited higher photocatalytic activity may ascribed to the synergistic effect between anatase and rutile in P25. Also, The H2 yield of CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts under simulated solar light irradiation in methanol aqueous solutions as summarized in our previous report [18]. We further examined effects of different sacrificial agents, including methanol, glycol and glycerol on the photocatalytic performance of CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts under the identical photocatalytic reaction condition. As shown in Fig. 9 , with the same photocatalyst, the photocatalytic H2 production rate follows an order of methanol ≈ glycol > glycerol. This agrees with previous reports and can be attributed to the polarity, mobility and steric hindrance in the carbon number of alcohol moieties [19,53–55]. Meanwhile, with the same sacrificial agent, the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production rate follows an order of CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1}. These results demonstrate TiO2 morphology-dependent photocatalytic performance of CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts. It is noteworthy that the BET specific surface areas of CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts followed an order of CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} > CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1}, different from that of photocatalytic activity order of CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts. This indicates that surface area is not a dominant structure factor in determining the high photocatalytic activity of CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts. Steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra were measured to probe charge separation efficiencies of TiO2 nanocrystals and CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts (Fig. 10 ). Table 2 summarizes the bi-exponential fitting results of time-resolved PL spectra. Generally, a decreased steady-state PL peak intensity and a prolonged time-resolved PL peak decay lifetime suggest slower recombination process with fast separation of electron-hole pairs [56,57]. CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} and CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1} exhibit weaker steady-state PL peaks and longer average decay lifetime than corresponding TiO2 nanocrystals; however, compared to TiO2-{1 0 0} nanocrystals, CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} exhibits an increased steady-state PL intensity and shortened average decay lifetime. Thus the loading of CuOx enhances the charge separation efficiency of TiO2-{0 0 1} and TiO2-{1 0 1} but decreases the charge separation efficiency of TiO2-{1 0 0}. Defective sites are the major recombination centers for photoexcited electron-hole pairs. The CO chemisorption results (Fig. 5) shows that the defective Ti4c sites induced by CuOx loading are much more on TiO2-{1 0 0} than on TiO2-{0 0 1} and TiO2-{1 0 1}. This could be a likely reason for a poorer charge separation efficiency of CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} than TiO2-{1 0 0}. However, the photocatalytic performances of all CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts are much better than those of corresponding TiO2 photocatalysts; meanwhile, CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1} with the best charge separation efficiency among all CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts does not exhibit the best photocatalytic activity. These demonstrate that the photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst is cooperatively determined by light absorption and charge generation, the charge separation and migration to surfaces, and charge-participated surface reactions. As a p-type semiconductor, the conduction band and valence band edges of Cu2O are located respectively above the conduction band and valence band edges of anatase TiO2 (Fig. 11 ). Illuminated by the solar light, both Cu2O and anatase TiO2 are photoexcited to produce the electron-hole carriers. The excited electrons in the conduction band of Cu2O transferred quickly to the conduction band of TiO2 at the Cu2O–TiO2-{0 0 1} interface due to the stronger interface interaction, leading to higher charge separation efficiency. Only efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons on the TiO2 surface is not enough for realizing the higher photocatalytic activity for H2 production on CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} photocatalyst. Additionally, initiating the hole-participated methanol photo oxidation reaction is also an extremely important step in the photocatalytic process. Generally, it was demonstrated that preferential transport directions of photogenerated carriers is another key factor accounting for the facet-dependent photocatalytic activity: {0 0 1} facets favor to trap holes as oxidative sites, while {1 0 1} facets incline to trap electrons as reductive sites [58–60]. According to the band structures of Cu2O–TiO2 heterojunction, the photoexcited holes in the valence band of TiO2 transfer to the valence band of Cu2O. Nevertheless, the predominant exposed TiO2-{0 0 1} facets has the higher hole migration and reaction rate compared with predominant exposed TiO2-{1 0 1} or TiO2-{1 0 0} facets. Such a cooperative influences on CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} sample is responsible for the highest enhancement times of photoreactivity than Cu2O–TiO2-{1 0 0} and Cu2O–TiO2-{1 0 1} photocatalysts. Therefore, CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts obviously exhibit TiO2 morphology-dependent CuOx-TiO2 interactions, CuOx speciation and dispersions, TiO2 defect structures, light absorption and charge separation properties, and photocatalytic performances. Table 3 summarizes the orders of different properties among all CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts. Enhanced photocatalytic H2 production of CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts followed the order of CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1}, but both light absorption property and charge separation efficiency follow an order of CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0}. The CuOx-TiO2 interaction and Cu2O dispersion follow an order of CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 0} > CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1}. It was previously that CuOx/TiO2 samples with larger populations of Cu2O-anatase TiO2 heterojunctions exhibit higher photocatalytic H2 production [24]. We thus attribute the highest photocatalytic H2 production of CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} among all CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts to the largest population of Cu2O-TiO2 heterojunctions resulted from the strongest CuOx-TiO2 interaction. The results add insights into morphology engineering as an effective strategy to tune structures and photocatalytic activity of TiO2-based composite photocatalysts."
6,Conclusions,"CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts with the same copper loading were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method employing TiO2 nanocrystals with different morphologies. TiO2 morphology-dependent CuOx-TiO2 interaction, compositions and structures, and photocatalytic performance were identified. CuOx/TiO2-{0 0 1} with the strongest CuOx-TiO2 interaction, the highest Cu2O dispersion and Cu2O-TiO2 heterojunction population exhibit the highest photocatalytic H2 production while CuOx/TiO2-{1 0 1} with the highest light absorption and charge separation efficiency does not. Such a strong TiO2 morphology-dependent structures and photocatalytic properties offer an effective strategy to tune structures and photocatalytic activity of TiO2-based composite photocatalysts via TiO2 morphology engineering."
