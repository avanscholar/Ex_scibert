0,Introduction,"The titanium-silicalite TS-2 is one of member of titanium-silicalite catalysts. This family also includes: TS-1, Ti-Beta, Ti-MCM-41 and Ti-MCM-48 catalysts. The synthesis of Ti-containing catalysts has opened new possibilities for using zeolites as oxidation catalysts. Zeolites TS-2 and TS-1, with MEL and MFI structures, respectively, are active and selective catalysts for the oxidation of following compounds: phenol to hydroquinone [1], olefines to epoxides [2] and alcohols to aldehydes and ketones [3] in the presence of H2O2 as the oxidation agent under the reaction conditions. The excellent and unique activity of TS-2 and TS-1 is mostly associated with the isolated Ti species (in tetrahedral coordination) in the hydrophobic framework of silica. The pore size (about 0.55nm) of TS-2 and TS-1 catalysts restricts the applications of these zeolites to the organic compounds with a relatively small molecular size. For this reason Ti-Beta [4–7], Ti-MCM-41 [8–10] and Ti-MCM-48 [11,12] were developed. They comprise a new type of large pores titanium-containing catalysts, which are better for the oxidation cyclic and branched alkanes and alkenes. Epoxide compounds are valuable semi- and final products of the organic industry. Nowadays, new methods of receiving them are developed and the previous ones are improved. The main stress is put on using catalyst and reactants safe for the environment. Using TS-2 a hydrogen peroxide can be activated and used in epoxidation. Simultaneously, by choosing right technological parameters of the process, it can be received a high selectivity of transformation to epoxide, at relatively high conversion of organic substrate. An extra profit of performing the epoxidation in mild conditions (low temperature, autogenic pressure) is a better security and also the limitation of costs of the epoxidation. A heterogeneous catalyst can be easily separated from the post-reaction mixture and turned back to the process. With the flow of time its activity is lower, due to the leaching of titanium from the catalyst structure. This phenomenon can be limited by choosing such technological parameters which can minimize formation of polyols—in this case glycerol [13]. The leaching of titanium can be also caused only by hydrogen peroxide present in reaction mixture. This phenomenon was observed for example for Ti-Beta or Ti-MCM-41 [14]. In case of TS-1 the leaching of Ti was the lowest. Thus in our investigations it was used only equimolecular amount of hydrogen peroxide or an excess of allyl alcohol to minimize this effect. A desired product of this reaction—glycidol is a very interesting intermediate for the preparation of many useful compounds. Glycidol can be applied for the manufacture of surface active agents, used as the components of the cosmetic formulations for moister and cleaning of skin (cosmetics neutral for skin), shampoo, bath fluids, toothpastes, mouthwash, detergents for washing (including those for washing in cold water) and disinfectants [15]. The surface active agents also comprise food emulgators used in the production of margarines, ice-creams and vegetable butter [16,17]. Other groups of glycidol applications include dispersing agents, plasticizers for resins and rubbers [18], and the detergents in the petroleum industry [19]. Glycidol also finds the application in the production of pharmaceuticals [20,21]. The influence of the technological parameters (temperature, the molar ratio of AA/H2O2, the concentration of methanol in reaction mixture, the concentration of TS-2 in reaction mixture and the reaction time) on the epoxidation of allyl alcohol (AA) over TS-2 catalyst to glycidol were described in this paper. The course of the process was estimated basing on the functions: selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to consumed allyl alcohol and hydrogen peroxide and conversion of allyl alcohol and hydrogen peroxide. Every function was presented in form of a mathematical equation for which maximum value and optimal technological parameters were established. Moreover, there were drawn the courses of the functions during the changes of two parameters in the defined range of their variability. The other parameters were established on the constant level corresponding to the maximum of the function. The main aim of this work was finding such technological parameters which permit to achieve high values of all investigated function simultaneously, but the most important function was selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to consumed allyl alcohol. It was done by the analyse and comparison the layer drawings of each function."
1,Experimental,
2,Raw materials,"2.1 Raw materials The following reagents were used in the epoxidation process: allyl alcohol (purity 98%, Fluka), hydrogen peroxide (30wt.% aqueous solution, P.O.Ch. Gliwice), methanol (purity >99.8%, P.O.Ch. Gliwice), a TS-2 catalyst (prepared in the Department of Organic Chemical Technology, Technical University of Szczecin). The quantitative GC analyses were performed using a gas chromatograph and glycidol (90% pure, Fluka) as a reference."
3,Preparation of TS-2 catalyst and its characteristic,"2.2 Preparation of TS-2 catalyst and its characteristic TS-2 catalyst was synthesized according to the procedure reported by Reddy et al. [1]. X-ray powder diffraction data of the TS-2 was collected on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation of wavelength 0.154. XRD pattern was obtained between 5° and 60° 2θ (Fig. 1 ). It was found that X-ray diffractogram of TS-2 obtained by us is similar to that reported by Reddy et al. [1]. Scanning electron micrographs were recorded using a JEOL JSM-6100 scanning electron microscope. Sample was deposited on a sample holder with an adhesive carbon foil and sputtered with gold. The particle size of TS-2 ranges from 1.0 to 1.5μm. The FT-IR spectrum of the TS-2 was recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-430 instrument using the KBr pellet techniques. The presence of the absorption band ∼960cm−1 was found for TS-2 catalyst. The UV–vis spectrum TS-2 was recorded on a SPECORD M40 instrument. The UV–vis spectrum TS-2 catalyst reveals a characteristic band at 220nm, which confirms the incorporation of titanium into the crystalline structure of silica. X-ray fluorescence analyse was performed on VRA X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The TiO2 content in TS-2 amounted to 1.5wt.%."
4,Epoxidation method,"2.3 Epoxidation method The determined quantities of the reagents were introduced into the autoclave equipped with PTFE insert of 8cm3 capacity in the following sequence: allyl alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, methanol and the catalyst. The amount of reagents was selected in such a way that the degree of autoclave filling did not exceed 80% of volume under maintaining the process parameters. The autoclave was screw, and than was placed in a handle of a shaker followed by immersion in an oil bath with the temperature controlled by a thermostat. The shaker was switched and the reaction was carried out over the appropriate time. After the reaction was completed, the autoclave was cooled and emptied. A post-reaction mixture was weighed, analyzed and balanced. The conversion of allyl alcohol does not take place in the process carried out without the catalyst TS-2 (blank test). Chromatographic analyses of post-reaction mixtures were carried out on a Chrom 5 apparatus equipped with flame-ionization detector (FID) with the application of a column packed with 10% Triton 100 on Chromosorb W 60/80 mesh. The column temperature was programmed in the following way: constant 50°C for 6min, followed by the increase to 140°C at the rate of 15°Cmin−1, isothermally for 6min, subsequently the increase to 142°C at the rate of 20°Cmin−1 and finally isothermally for 2min. The quantitative calculations were performed by the external standard methods. Glycerol was determined by means of periodate titration [22], whereas hydrogen peroxide by iodometric titration [23]. The results of the experiments allowed to calculate the values of the following functions: selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to consumed allyl alcohol (S glyc/AA), selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to hydrogen peroxide ( S glyc / H 2 O 2 ) , conversion of allyl alcohol (C AA) and conversion of H2O2 ( C H 2 O 2 ) . A way of calculations of these function is presented below: Conversion of raw material ( allyl alcohol , H 2 O 2 ) , C AA or C H 2 O 2 = Amount of raw material consumed Initial amount of raw material × 100 % Selectivity to glycidol in relation to consumed H 2 O 2 , S gly / H 2 O 2 = Amount of glycidol Amount of H 2 O 2 consumed × 100 % Selectivity to glycidol in relation to consumed AA, S glyc / AA = Amount of glycidol Amount of AA consumed × 100 %"
5,Results and discussion,"In the process of allyl alcohol epoxidation with H2O2 and over TS-2 catalyst, glycidol was formed together with by-products. Depending on process parameters different amounts of the following by-products were obtained: glycerol, acroleine, diallyl ether, allyl-glycidol ether, the products of oxirane ring solvolysis and polymers. A high temperature caused the formation of polymers which included mers of allyl alcohol and glycidol as well as by-products. The reaction are presented below. Glycidol is the most susceptible to the attack of the nucleophilic molecules (in this case water and methanol) present in reaction medium. This reaction causes the opening of the epoxide ring and formation for example glycerol. In the case if process is carried out at high temperatures the epoxide ring reactions occurs easier which leads to the formation of various polyethers. In this work were presented the results of the investigations performed to determine the influence of the technological parameters on the epoxidation of allyl alcohol. The optimization of the technological parameters was performed according to rotatable-uniform design [24–27]. An experimental design and the calculations were performed by computer applying a software Cadex:Esdet 2.2. The plan was realized for five input variables x 1–x 5 (technological parameters), where x 1 is the temperature, 15–90°C; x 2 the AA to H2O2 molar ratio, 0.5–5.0mol/mol; x 3 the methanol concentration, 5–90wt.%; x 4 the TS-2 concentration, 0.1–2.0wt.%; x 5 is the reaction time, 15–120min. The total number of the systems of design (experiments) amounted to 32, including 16 in the plan nucleus, 10 in the stars points, whereas 6 in the plan center. The real values of input variables x 1–x 5 were recalculated into the normalized values (dimensionless) according to equation: X k = 2 α ( x k − x k min ) ( x k max − x k min − α where X k ∈[−α, α]; X k the normalized input variable, k =1, …, i; i the number of input variables (5); α the star arm (α =2); x k the real input variable, k =1, …, i; x kmax the maximum value of the real input variable, k =1, …, i; x kmin is the minimum value of the real input variable, k =1, …, i. A universal experimental design with the values of normalized input variables in the dimensionless range [−2, 2] was achieved as a result of the normalization operation. The real and normalized input variables at the levels resulting from the experimental design are shown in Table 1 . The response functions characterizing the epoxidation process of AA with H2O2 over the TS-2 catalyst were assumed as follows: z 1 is the selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to AA consumed (S glyc/AA); z 2 the selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to H2O2 consumed ( S glyc / H 2 O 2 ) ; z 3 the conversion of AA (C AA) and z 4 is the conversion of H2O2 ( C H 2 O 2 ) . The design matrix of the experimental design and experimentally determined values of the response functions z 1–z 4 are shown in Table 2 . The influence of normalized independent factors (X 1–X 5) of the epoxidation on the values of the response functions such as selectivities and conversions were presented in the form of a polynomial of second order: Z = Z ( X k ) = b 0 + b 1 X 1 + ⋯ + b i X i + + b 11 X 1 2 ⋯ + b i i X i 2 + b 12 X 1 X 2 + ⋯ + b i − 1 , i X i − 1 X i , for X k ∈ [ − 2 , 2 ] where b i is the normalized coefficient of the approximation function and N b is the number of polynomial coefficients, N b =0.5(i +1)(i +2), i is the number of the input variables X k , k =1, 2, …, i. In order to obtain the response function containing the real coefficients and the real input variables x k (technological parameters), the normalized input variables X k were recalculated into the real values using the following relationships: X 1 =0.0533(x 1 −15)−2, X 2 =0.8889(x 2 −0.5)−2, X 3 =0.047(x 3 −5)−2, X 4 =2.105(x 4 −0.1)−2, X 5 =0.0381(x 5 −15)−2. The coefficients of the regression function for the normalized input variables (technological parameters) were determined by the least-square method with the application of matrix calculations (Table 3 ). After the determination of function approximating the experimental results, a verification of an adequacy this function was performed based on the Fisher–Snedecor test by a comparison with the critical value of F(α) taken from tables [28]. The relative errors of the approximation and the correlation coefficient R for the respective functions were calculated. In Table 3 are also given the values of S repeat . 2 – variance of inaccuracy; f repeat. – freedom degrees number of variance of inaccuracy; S adeq . 2 – variance of adequacy; f adeq. – freedom degrees number of variance of adequacy; R – coefficient of multiple correlation; Δz max – the maximum error of approximation. All the calculations were carried out for the significance level α =0.05. The mathematical optimization of the obtained regression equations has been performed with the application of the methods: Hooke-Jeeves oraz Gauss-Seidel. Similar values of the maxima were obtained in each of the methods. The highest values of the response functions and corresponding to them values of the technological parameters were summarized in Table 4 . The technological parameters determining the maximum values of functions: S glyc/AA and S glyc / H 2 O 2 (all reach 100mol%) are very close to each other. These parameters comprise: temperature 17–47°C, the AA/H2O2 molar ratio 4.8–4.9:1, methanol concentration 86–90wt.%, TS-2 concentration 1.9wt.% and reaction time 30–115min. The functions C AA and C H 2 O 2 achieve maximum (100mol%) at lower AA/H2O2 molar ratio (0.5:1mol/mol). The first function achieves maximum at higher temperature (90°C) and at lower TS-2 concentration (0.2wt.%), whereas the second function achieves 100mol% at the lowest temperature (22°C) and at the highest TS-2 catalyst concentration (2.0wt.%). In order to definitely determine which values of the parameters are the optimum parameters for the epoxidation process, the analysis of each function should be performed. For this purpose the courses of function variations during the changes of two technological parameters were plotted, maintaining the other ones constant. The constant parameters determined the maximum of a given function. The most important function in the determination of the optimum process parameters was S glyc/AA."
6,Influence of the technological parameters on the selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to consumed allyl alcohol (z 1),"3.1 Influence of the technological parameters on the selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to consumed allyl alcohol (z 1) The influence of changes of two selected technological parameters of the process on selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to consumed AA (z 1) at the optimum values of the remain independent variables (factors) allowed to obtain the maximum of the function was shown in Figs. 2–4 . From Fig. 2 results that high selectivities of transformation AA to glycidol were achieved over the entire range of variations of the AA/H2O2 molar ratios and temperatures. A small decrease of function z 1 can be seen above the range of temperatures 70–90°C. It can be concluded, that the decrease of selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to AA consumed with increase of process temperature is a result of the increase in the speed of opening of oxirane ring under the influence of water and methanol. In the result of the hydrolysis glycerol is formed and solvolysis leads to methyl ethers formation. Using the molar ratios AA/H2O2 >1 does not find also the grounds due to the necessity of recirculation of a great amount of AA. At higher ratios of reactants (1.1–2.2mol/mol) and at high temperatures (70–90°C) it can be also observed reactions of etherification and polymerization. Polymers can block pores of catalyst and this phenomenon causes the decrease of the values of function z 1. Thus, the process can be carried out at low temperature (20–70°C) and at low AA/H2O2 molar ratio (1:1mol/mol). Fig. 3 shows that at the methanol concentration at least 62wt.% in the temperature range of 15–90°C, selectivity of transformation AA to glycidol achieved a value of 100mol%. Thus, high methanol concentrations (62–90wt.%) favor the high selectivity of transformation AA to glycidol. It is necessary to have methanol in the reaction medium, because it increases a speed of the epoxidation process. It was presented [29–31] a mechanism of the epoxidation and due to it, a five-membered active compound was formed, in which a molecule of methanol plays the main role. In the active compound there are also hydrogen peroxide and titanium included into the structure of silicalite creating an active centre. Due to it the hydrogen peroxide is activated and there is possible to transfer the oxygen to the unsaturated bonding (electrophilic oxidation). In the structure A, the methanol molecule is associated with the active centre by the coordinate bond. The concentration of methanol in the reaction mixture has an important significance for the run of epoxidation. To small concentration limits creating of five-membered active compounds. Too high concentration can make solvolysis of the epoxide ring. As it was shown in structure B, the process of epoxidation also enables creating a hydrogen bond between the hydrogen atom of –OH group from allyl alcohol and oxygen atom lying nearer the titanium atom in five-membered active compound. In this way the ability to oxidation –OH group of allyl alcohol is blocked and the oxygen can be moved very easily to the double bond of the alcohol forming epoxide. From Fig. 4 results that at the optimum temperature (47°C) the change of the TS-2 catalyst concentration from 0.1 to 1.0wt.% causes an increase of the selectivity of transformation AA to glycidol from 20 to 100mol%. At any constant TS-2 concentration above 1wt.%, a change of the temperature within investigated range did not cause the change of this investigated function. In this area the z 1 function has the maximum value 100mol%. Moreover, at the lowest investigated temperature (20°C) and at TS-2 concentrations over the range of 1–2wt.% the selectivity 100mol% can be achieved. That high range of concentrations of TS-2 (1–2wt.%) is needed to perform the process because the used catalyst can be deactivated due to pore blocking by formed polymers. Deactivation can also proceeded due to leaching titanium from the catalyst structure. It was proved [13,14], that compounds containing three –OH groups cause leaching titanium from the titanium silicalite structure. In that case glycerol plays this role. From the investigations of dependence of temperature and the reaction time at methanol concentration 90wt.%, at catalyst concentration 1.9wt.% and at the molar ratio of AA/H2O2 =4.9:1 results that over the entire range of change of process temperature and reaction time, the selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to consumed AA amounts to 100mol%. From analysis results that the most pronounced effect on the selectivity of transformation to glycidol have the concentrations of methanol, catalyst and temperature. The smallest effect has the AA/H2O2 molar ratio and the reaction time. From the point of view of the selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to consumed AA the process proceeds most advantageously under the following conditions: temperature 20°C, the molar ratio AA/H2O2 =1, methanol concentration 62–90wt.%, the TS-2 catalyst content of 1.0–2.0wt.% and the reaction time of 15–120min."
7,Influence of the technological parameters on the selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to consumed hydrogen peroxide (z 2),"3.2 Influence of the technological parameters on the selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to consumed hydrogen peroxide (z 2) The parameters at which function z 2 achieves the maximum (100mol%) are as follows: temperature 17°C, molar ratio AA/H2O2 =4.8, methanol concentration 86wt.%, TS-2 concentration 1.9wt.% and reaction time 115min. From Fig. 5 results that over the range of temperatures 15–70°C and over the entire range of investigated molar ratios a function z 2 reaches maximum (100mol%). Moreover, the methanol concentration does not influence on the function z 2 over the range of temperatures 15–55°C, and in this temperature range the function reaches maximum. At ambient temperature and for TS-2 catalyst concentrations exceeding 0.4wt.% the selectivity of transformation H2O2 to glycidol achieves 100mol%. In the case of dependence temperature–reaction time over the entire area of these parameters variability, a function of selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to consumed H2O2 reaches maximum. The selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to consumed H2O2 (z 2 =100mol%) reaches maximum at the following parameters: temperature 20°C, molar ratio AA/H2O2 =1, methanol concentration 5–90wt.%, TS-2 concentration 0.4–2.0wt.% and the reaction time 15–120min. These parameters for a function z 2 are the same as those recognized as the most advantageous from the point of view of selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to consumed AA (z 1). Thus the best conditions of the process running from the point of view of functions z 1 and z 2 are the following: temperature 20°C, the molar ratio AA/H2O2 =1, methanol concentration 90wt.%, TS-2 concentration 2.0wt.% and the reaction time 120min. The verifying experiments carried out at these technological parameters allowed to achieve the following values of the functions describing the process: S glyc/AA =100mol%, S glyc / H 2 O 2 = 100 mol % , C AA =87.7mol% and C H 2 O 2 = 100 mol % . The application of these parameters will be beneficial due to a decrease of raw materials and energy consumption (decrease of AA/H2O2 molar ratio from 5 to 1)."
8,Influence of the technological parameters on the degree of conversion of allyl alcohol (z 3) and hydrogen peroxide (z 4),"3.3 Influence of the technological parameters on the degree of conversion of allyl alcohol (z 3) and hydrogen peroxide (z 4) The allyl alcohol conversion achieves a maximum value z 3 =100mol% (Table 4) for the following parameters: temperature 90°C, the molar ratio AA/H2O2 =0.5, methanol concentration 90wt.%, TS-2 concentration 0.2wt.% and reaction time 17min. This function also achieves the highest value or a value close to it in other ranges of parameters variability. From a dependence of temperature and AA/H2O2 molar ratio results that over entire range of variations the full conversion of AA can be obtained when the molar ratio AA/H2O2 does not exceed 1.1 (Fig. 6 ). For the dependence of temperature–methanol concentration the range of temperature 50–90°C was found to be most advantageous at simultaneously low methanol concentrations. However, an increase of methanol concentration to 65wt.% allows to achieve the highest AA conversion even at low temperature (20°C) (Fig. 7 ). The smallest influence on a high AA conversion has the catalyst concentration. Independently of the process temperature, during a change of TS-2 catalyst concentration over the range of 0.1–1.3wt.% the maximum value of AA conversion can be obtained. A dependence temperature-reaction time also shows a maximum of AA conversion over the entire range of variations of parameters. An analysis of figures for function z 3 reveals that over a wide range of variations of parameters this function reaches maximum value. These ranges are as follows: temperature 50–90°C, the molar ratio AA/H2O2 =0.5–1.0, methanol concentration 65–90wt.%, TS-2 concentration 0.1–1.0wt.% and the reaction time at least 15min. In this area of changes are included the parameters determining high values of functions z 1–z 3. The optimum parameters determined for functions z 1–z 2 are also optimal for function z 3. The conversion of H2O2 (function z 4) should be about 100mol% because unreacted H2O2 is one of the main problem in epoxidation process. Hydrogen peroxide has to be removed from the post-reaction mixture. This is the way of avoiding from the danger of blowing up. If z 4 is smaller than 100mol% hydrogen peroxide should be decomposed by heating carefully at the higher temperature, but it gives losses of the epoxide due to polymerization and other reactions such as: hydrolysis, solvolysis and etherification. Due to it, the temperature is decreased and the decomposition is carried out in the presence of active carbon, pumice or some metals such as grinded silver, gold and platinum. Chemical decomposition by solutions of ferrosalts(II) and sodium sulphate(IV) has a small significance because of the impurity of the introduced salts. An increase of temperature in the range 15–90°C and the prolongation of reaction time over the range 20–120min is advantageous to achieve a high hydrogen peroxide conversion (function z 4). An increase of TS-2 catalyst concentration causes a smaller increase of hydrogen peroxide conversion. Fig. 8 shows the course of conversion in the system of two variables: temperature and TS-2 catalyst concentration. An increase of the methanol concentration from 80 to 90wt.% at low temperature decreases the degree of H2O2 conversion to about a several percentages. Over the range of methanol concentrations 5–75wt.% the maximum value of function z 4 can be obtained. From the course of isolines for hydrogen peroxide conversion in the parameters system: temperature-reaction time results that over the entire range of variations of these parameters at the molar ratio AA/H2O2 =0.5 and the methanol concentration 15wt.% can be achieved the complete conversion of hydrogen peroxide."
9,Conclusions,"After the analyses of layer drawings for the investigated functions the following optimum conditions for the AA epoxidation process were established: temperature 20°C, the molar ratio AA/H2O2 =1:1, methanol concentration 90wt.%, TS-2 concentration 2wt.% and the reaction time 120min (the most important function was selectivity of transformation to glycidol in relation to consumed allyl alcohol). The verification experiments were carried out to confirm the selection of optimum parameters. The following results were obtained: S glyc/AA =100mol%, S glyc / H 2 O 2 = 100 mol % , C AA =87.7mol% and C H 2 O 2 = 100 mol % . The determined conditions allow to limit the amount of side products received in the process, especially glycerol, ethers and polymers. The parameters allow to receive the long time of the catalyst work because they limit leaching of titanium from the catalyst structure and blocking pores by polymers. The determined parameters are mild. The solvent and unreacted AA can be distilled off and reused in process. From the point of view distillation of epoxide the total conversion of H2O2 is beneficial because the decomposition of H2O2 should not be done."
