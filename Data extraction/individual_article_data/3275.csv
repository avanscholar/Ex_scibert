0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean and sustainable energy source for various industrial activities with very high energy capacity per unit mass (118.2kJ/g) (Park et al., 2005). It is non-polluting fuel and can be used in fuel cells for the production of electricity (Lay et al., 1999). Conventional and present sources of hydrogen production (e.g., water electrolysis or chemical cracking of hydrocarbons) require electricity derived from fossil fuels or nuclear fission; thus biohydrogen production is gaining wide attention due to recent concerns over global warming (Dincer, 2002; Hawkes et al., 2002). Hydrogen can be produced biologically through microbes either by photosynthetic bacteria cultured under anaerobic conditions or by anaerobic fermentative bacteria. In contrast to photolytic production of H2, anaerobic fermentative processes have fast production rates, reduced waste generation and no requirement of additional light energy (Das and Verziroglu, 2001). Fermentative hydrogen production from organic substances results in the incomplete decomposition of substrate into organic acids such as acetate and butyrate. Butyrate is more dominant because of its lower Gibbs free energy (ΔG =−257.1kJ) compared to acetate (ΔG =−184.2kJ) and its production involves enzyme activity (Nandi and Sengupta, 1998; Zaborsky, 1998). Biological hydrogen production utilizes organic wastewater or other wastes as raw materials which contain a variety of organic substrates (Lin and Chen, 2006). The high sulfate content in wastes produced from pulp/paper, sea-food processing and alcohol fermentation industries (Chen et al., 2008) has been found to adversely affect the anaerobic digestion (Bitton, 1994). Treatment of sulfate containing wastewater by anaerobic fermentation results in SRB proliferation. In previous reports, most of the acidogenic procedures showed decreased hydrogen and methane gas production in sulfate rich wastewater at pH 6–7 (Li et al., 1996; Mizuno et al., 1998; Esposito et al., 2003). Mizuno et al. (1998) investigated the effects of COD/SO4 2− ratio and HRT in acidogenic phase and clearly suggested that sulfate reducing bacteria can adversely influence on the pathway of sucrose degradation leading to lower hydrogen production. However, improved H2 production was observed at lower pH conditions (e.g., pH 5.5), irrespective of variation in sulfate concentrations up to 3000mg L−1 (Lin and Chen, 2006). Iron is also known to be beneficial to microbial hydrogen production (Lee et al., 2009). Moreover, the effect of COD/SO4 2− ratios on hydrogen fermentation in conjunction with varying HRTs has not been systemically investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of COD/SO4 2− ratio and Fe(II) under the variable hydraulic retention time (HRT) on fermentative hydrogen production in a continuous reactor. The distribution of hydrogen producing bacteria (HPB) and sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) was analyzed by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Operation of chemostat reactor systems,"2.1 Operation of chemostat reactor systems Three anaerobic reactors of 2.0L capacity with 1.0L working volume were used in this study. The reactor was filled with mixed liquor and continuously stirred by biogas re-circulated with a vacuum pump (Iwaki, max vacuum 34.66kPa) at a flow rate of 5L min−1. The volume of biogas produced was measured by connecting the reactor to a biogas collection cylinder placed in an acidic (2% H2SO4) and saturated NaCl solution. The chemostat reactors were installed in a temperature controlled chamber maintained at 35±1°C by a fan heater (WH-601F). The pH in the reactors was adjusted to 5.5 using 3N KOH. The substrate (glucose) was prepared daily and stored in a substrate reservoir maintained at 4±1°C. Substrate was continuously added into the reactor with a micro-tube pump (EYELA, MP-3). Each chemostat reactor system was maintained at HRTs of 6, 12 and 24h for 282days."
3,Seed sludge and substrate,"2.2 Seed sludge and substrate Sludge was obtained from the Wonju Water Supply and Drainage Center (Wonju, South Korea). The pH, carbohydrate and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were 6.8, 1100, and 4800mg L−1 respectively, in the seed sludge. VFAs and alkalinity of the sludge were 390 and 2460mg L−1, respectively. Glucose was used as the substrate with a concentration of 14,063mg L−1 (15,000mg COD L−1). The inoculum was acclimatized to glucose for 3months in an anaerobic continuous culture. Iron sulfate (FeSO4.7H2O) was used as the iron and sulfate source with concentrations ranging from 0 to 11,600mg Fe L−1 and 0 to 20,000 SO4 2− mg L−1. Control experiments (without the addition of SO4 2− other than that present in nutrients) were also conducted. The initial pH of the substrate tank was 7.8–8.1. The feed contained the following nutrients (in mg L−1): NH4HCO3, 4700; K2HPO4, 125; MgCl2.6H2O, 100; MnSO4.6H2O, 15; FeSO4.7H2O, 25; CuSO4.5H2O, 5; CoCl2.5H2O, 0.1 and NaHCO3, 2000. The reactor was monitored for pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), gas production and composition, glucose concentration, sulfate concentration, ethanol and VFA distribution under the operational conditions."
4,Identification of the microflora population by FISH technique,"2.3 Identification of the microflora population by FISH technique The FISH technique with 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes was employed to monitor the change in the microbial community of anaerobic biomass in the chemostat reactor systems. In situ hybridization of activated sludge cells was performed according to the protocol proposed by Amann (1995). The oligonucleotide probes used in this study are specific for phylogenetic groups of HPB and SRB, as listed in Table 1 . Oligonucleotides were synthesized and fluorescently labeled with a hydrophilic sulfoindocyanine dye (Cy-3) and/or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and/or 6-carboxy-fluorescein (6-FAM) at the 5′ end (Bionics, Seoul, South Korea). Anaerobic biomass samples were recovered from the reactor on 62, 98, 126, 156, 192, 223, 257 and 282days and fixed in 4% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde solution for 3–4h at 4°C. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to rinse the biofilm samples. Each fixed biofilm sample was placed in a small aluminum cup overnight at room temperature to allow the Jung OCT compound (Leica Int.) to penetrate the biofilm samples. Biofilm samples were frozen at −20°C and cut into 20μm thick vertical slices with a cryostat (Reichart–Jung cryocut 1800; Leica Int.). Each slice was placed on a slide coated with 0.1% gelatin in the presence of 0.01% chromium potassium sulfate and dried overnight at room temperature. The specimen were dehydrated by successive 50, 80 and 98% ethanol washes (3min each) followed by air drying, and stored at room temperature until further use. In situ hybridizations were performed in a hybridization incubator using formamide at 46°C for 2h. Hybridization was followed twice by a stringent washing step at 48°C for 10min with 50mL of pre-warmed washing buffer (20mM Tris hydrochloride [pH 7.2], 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate). The washing buffer was removed by rinsing the slides with distilled water and the slides were air dried. The slides were mounted to avoid bleaching and examined with an Axioplan epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) and MRC-1024 (Bio–Rad, UK) CLSM."
5,Analyses,"2.4 Analyses Chemical oxygen demand; dichromate reflux method (CODcr), alkalinity and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) were analyzed by standard methods (APHA, 1995). Protein and carbohydrate were measured by the Lowry method (Anderson et al., 1982) and anthrone-H2SO4 (Mah et al., 1990), respectively. SRB were analyzed by the FISH method. The pretreatment of samples for total sulfide (TS) and dissolved sulfide (DS) was done by zinc acetate and determined by iodometric methods (Morgulis and Hemphill, 1932). The pH and ORP were measured by a pH meter (Thermo orion 290A, Orion corporation) and an ORP meter (RM-20P, DKK.TOA corporation), respectively. The H2 gas was analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-14, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector using a stainless steel column packed with molecular sieve 5A and Ar as a carrier gas. The operational temperatures of the injector, detector and column were 80, 110 and 60°C, respectively. CO2, CH4 and H2S were measured by the same detector with a 2.5m stainless column packed with Hayesep Q (80/100) and helium (He) as a carrier gas. Ethanol and VFA were analyzed by flame ionization detector (Shimadzu GC-8A, Japan) equipped with a glass column packed with 10% REOPLEX 400. The temperatures of injector port, detector and column were 240, 240 and 140°C, respectively. Samples were filtered with 0.45μm GF/C (Glass fiber filter, Type C) filters and sulfate concentration was analyzed by ion chromatography (DX-120, Dionex Corporation, USA) equipped with an analytical column (Dionex Ionpac AS14-4mm) and a guard column (Dionex Ionpac AG14-4mm)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen production,"3.1 Hydrogen production Daily variations in biogas production, hydrogen production and ORP are shown in Fig. 1 . Average biogas production increased from 4.5 to 5.8, 7.5 to 9.3 and 14.3 to 19.2L day−1 and hydrogen production increased from 2.1 to 2.9, 3.9 to 4.7 and 7.1 to 9.4L day−1, as HRTs decreased from 24 to 6h at pH 5.5 (Figs. 1a,b and Table 2 ). Biogas was composed mainly of H2 and CO2 throughout all experiments. Hydrogen content gradually increased from 46.4 to 51.1, 47.3 to 53.2 and 48.3 to 50.7% when iron concentration increased up to 1750mg L−1. ORP ranged from −395 to −510mV at HRTs of 24–6h with COD/SO4 2− ratio of 150–0.75 (with control). It has been reported that the hydrogen production was enhanced under the anaerobic conditions when ORP was below −200mV (Wang et al., 2006). HRT is an important factor affecting biological hydrogen production. Kataoka et al. (1997) and Lin and Lay (2004) showed elevated hydrogen production at HRTs of 4–8h. The marked increase in hydrogen production at HRT 6h (Fig. 1b) might be due to the high organic loading rate (with shorter HRT) for hydrogen producing cultures (Lin and Lay, 2004). Relatively lower COD/SO4 2− ratio down to 0.75 (e.g., high sulfate concentrations up to 20,000mg L−1) did not affect biogas or hydrogen production (Fig. 1a) at HRTs of 24, 12, and 6h at pH 5.5 suggesting that sulfate reducing bacteria in the culture were not active at such conditions, and H2 production was not influenced by high sulfate concentrations. At HRT of 6h, H2 production increased from 7.3 to 9.4L day−1 as COD/SO4 2− ratio changed from 150 to 5 and 3. A slight decrease in H2 production occurred at COD/SO4 2− ratio of 1.5 and 0.75. The increase in H2 production at COD/SO4 2− ratios of 5 and 3 and the subsequent decrease at COD/SO4 2− ratios of 1.5 and 0.75 could be due to the Fe(II) concentration added to the reactor. Iron is known to be beneficial for bacterial growth during hydrogen production (Zhang et al., 2005) which is consistent with the increased hydrogen production at COD/SO4 2− ratios of 5 and 3 (hydrogen production was 9.4L day−1 at iron concentration of 1750mg L−1). However, an excess amount of iron (ca. 3000mg L−1) could be harmful for the microbial activity, leading to reduced hydrogen production (Zhang et al., 2005). Such an inhibition effect could be due to precipitation of iron minerals on the microbial cell surface. MINTEQA2 (Allison et al., 1990) calculations indicated that the solution was oversaturated with respect to several mineral phases such as siderite [FeCO3(s)], vivianite [Fe3P2O8 ·8H2O(s)] and manganese hydrogenphosphate [MnHPO4(s)] under the experimental conditions at pH 5.5. An inhibitory mechanism involving the iron oxyhydroxide coatings on the cell surface was also reported by Liu et al. (2001), who observed the formation of iron mineral coatings on S. putrefaciens after exposure of cells to Fe2+. Development of these coatings coincides with a lag phase during which the reduction of Fe(III) citrate was inhibited. The amount of consumed substrate in the reactor, MLVSS, residual sulfate, TS and DS concentration under steady state conditions were recorded (Table 2). Average glucose degradation decreased from 93 to 88% by decreasing the HRT from 24 to 6h. However, COD/SO4 2− variation did not influence on glucose degradation to a great extent. Further, regardless of sulfate concentration, there was little difference in the fractions of residual sulfate, with the average of 97.3, 96.0, and 95.6% at HRTs of 24, 12 and 6h, respectively. When COD/SO4 2− ratio varied from 150 to 0.75, TS and DS concentrations varied from 2.0 to 9.0mg L−1 and 1.0 to 4.0mg L−1, respectively. Furthermore, hydrogen contents of 48, 51 and 49% and MLVSS concentrations of 4.3, 3.6 and 3.1mg L−1 were observed under controlled COD/SO4 2− conditions at HRTs of 24, 12 and 6h, respectively. This result indicates that there was no significant effect of increasing TS and DS on sulfate reduction. Thus, competition effect was not evident between SRB and HPB at pH 5.5. Residual sulfate was relatively constant (93.7–98.2%) under all experimental conditions. The residual sulfate fraction was 83.5%, confirming that moderate pH conditions are required for SRB to reduce sulfate. The analysis of MLVSS revealed that cell concentrations were lower at shorter HRTs due to cell washout. In this study, sulfate reduction did not occur significantly with variation in COD/SO4 2− ratios. The difference in HRT and COD/SO4 2− affected HPB and SRB populations, which directly influenced on parameters such as hydrogen production rate (HPR), specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR), hydrogen yield (HY) and hydrogen content. Daily variations in SHPR, HPR and HY at each HRT under steady state conditions are shown in Fig. 2 . SHPR was 23.5–31.4mmol H2 g−1 VSS−1 day−1 and HPR was 103.6–149.1mmol H2 L−1 day−1 for different COD/SO4 2− ratios at 24h. Variations in hydrogen production were observed by varying HRT. Hydrogen yield was 1.3–2.0mol H2 mol−1 glucose for different COD/SO4 2− ratios. When HRT was reduced to 6h, HPR and SHPR increased by ca. 350 and 550%, respectively. The relatively invariant hydrogen production with varying COD/SO4 2− ratios was presumably due to low pH (5.5) at which the activity of SRB was significantly suppressed (Figs. 1 and 2). This is in agreement with a previous study (Lin and Chen, 2006). In our study, higher hydrogen yield was observed at relatively longer HRT (24h) compared to short HRTs (6–12h) due to more carbohydrate conversion into hydrogen at longer HRT. Similar results were also reported by other workers (Yu et al., 2002). Glucose was converted into high soluble volatile solids (SVS) (lower degradation of carbohydrate) at short HRTs (6–12h) which resulted in lower hydrogen yields (see Table 3 ). However, at longer HRT (24h), glucose was converted into VFAs production and low SVS (greater degradation of carbohydrate), which were further converted into hydrogen resulting in higher hydrogen yield (Table 3). The glucose conversion rate efficiency was 83.7–96.8% in our study, while higher conversion rate efficiency (>99%) has been reported in previous reports (Lin and Chang, 1999). A comparison of the maximum hydrogen yield obtained in this study to those cited in the literature is summarized in Table 4 ."
8,Effect of soluble metabolite product (SMP) concentrations on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of soluble metabolite product (SMP) concentrations on hydrogen production Production of SMP occurs simultaneously with the decay of organic matter in anaerobic systems. In the acidogenic reactor, VFAs and ethanol can be converted to acids (butyric, propionic, acetic, etc.) quickly by acetogenic bacteria and HPB, yielding acetic acid as the final product. Acetic (HAc) and propionic (HPr) acids were secondary products, with butyric (HBu) acid being the main product in all experiments for butyrate type fermentation (Yokoi et al., 1997). Ethanol has also been reported as the major SMP during anaerobic saccharide degradation (Lin and Chen, 2006). The VFAs and SMP fractions in the effluents are summarized in Table 5 . HBu concentrations at control (non-sulfate) and COD/SO4 2− ratio of 0.75 were 50.3–57.3% (1544–1879mg L−1), 51.0–57.5% (1913–2058mg L−1) and 54.5–59.8% (2184–2554mg L−1) at HRTs of 24, 12 and 6h, respectively. The VFA fractions in the effluent were generally in the order of HBu>HAc>EtOH>HPr. Average values of HAc (26.6%; 857.3mg L−1, 23.3%; 842.0mg L−1 and 21.9%; 896.7mg L−1), HPr (5.8%; 187.6mg L−1, 7.0%; 252.6mg L−1 and 6.5%; 267.7mg L−1) and EtOH (13.9%; 444.5mg L−1, 14.6%; 530.3mg L−1, and 14.1%; 577.9mg L−1) were found to be similar for HRTs of 24, 12 and 6h at pH 5.5, irrespective of COD/SO4 2− ratio. It has been reported that anaerobic fermentation increases the production of propionic acid, lactic acid and ethanol when hydrogen production decreases (Hawkes et al., 2002). In our study, fermentation resulted in low propionic acid and ethanol productions with high hydrogen production with little influence of varying COD/SO4 2− ratio. This might be attributed to the shift in the metabolic pathway of hydrogen production (from HBu fermentation to ethanol fermentation). Our results are in agreement with previous study where hydrogen production was lower with high ethanol formation (Lin and Chen, 2006). Only small variations in TVFA/SMP (0.8–0.9) and ethanol/SMP (0.1–0.2) were observed during hydrogen production for different COD/SO4 2− ratios (at pH 5.5). These results suggest that butyrate was the dominant metabolic product for higher hydrogen production. The butyrate/acetate (B/A) ratio could be a velocity indicator of HRT and H2 production by anaerobic microflora. A linear relationship was observed between B/A ratio and HY at different COD/SO4 2− ratios (Fig. 3 )."
9,FISH analysis of microflora population,"3.3 FISH analysis of microflora population Seed sludge samples were analyzed for COD/SO4 2− ratios of control (day 62), 150 (day 98), 50 (day 126), 15 (day 156), 5 (day 192), 3 (day 223), 1.5 (day 257) and 0.75 (day 282) by FISH. In this study, Clostridium spp. (Ueno et al., 2001) and sulfate reducing bacteria (Devereux et al., 1992) were used for hybridization. Specific-probe hybridized cell populations were analyzed by the FISH technique and used for the qualitative analysis of HPB and SRB relative to the total bacteria, which specifically hybridized to probe Eubmix. The samples were double hybridized with Casc67 (Cy3)+Eubmix (FITC) and/or KO226 (6-FAM)+Eubmix (Cy3). Many of the cells (HPB) targeted by Casc 67, Robo730 and ENT183 appeared to be relatively small and formed spherical, tightly packed clusters. FISH analysis indicates the presence of HPB (Clostridium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium perfringens and Ruminococcus flavefaciens) under all experimental conditions (FISH images are not shown). However, SRB cells were not detected by FISH with SRB 687, 660, 129 and 221. Therefore, neither Desulfovibrio spp. (targeted by SRB 687) nor Desulfobulbus spp. (targeted by SRB 660) was present in our enrichment culture. Lin and Chen (2006) reported ca. 40% increase in hydrogen production by lowering the operating pH from 6.7 to 5.5, as SRB could not survive at pH 5.5. Lin and Chen (2006) reported the presence of SRB only when the solution pH was 6.7 which significantly influenced on hydrogen production. This observation has confirmed by FISH analysis in our study."
10,Conclusions,"The effect of COD/SO4 2− ratio and HRT variation on fermentative hydrogen production was investigated. Increased hydrogen production at COD/SO4 2− ratios of 5 and 3, HRT of 6h at pH 5.5 presumably occurred due to Fe(II) concentrations added to the reactor which improved the bioactivity of hydrogenases resulting in higher hydrogen production. The increase in H2 production at COD/SO4 2− ratios of 5 and 3 and its subsequent decrease at COD/SO4 2− ratios of 1.5 and 0.75 could be due to Fe(II) concentration added to the reactor. Experimental results suggest that butyrate is a dominant metabolic product for higher hydrogen production. A linear relationship was observed between B/A ratio and HY at different COD/SO4 2− ratios. FISH analysis indicated the presence of HPB under all experimental conditions, while SRB were not observed. A maximum hydrogen yield of 2.0mol H2 mol−1 glucose was observed in our study (HRT of 24h, pH 5.5) due to increased carbohydrate conversion into hydrogen at longer HRT (24h)."
