0,Introduction,"In recent decades, increasing attention has been paid to the production of liquid fuels and chemicals from the renewable feedstock, such as biomass, due to the environmental concerns and the non-sustainable feature associated with the use of the fossil feedstocks [1–4]. Among the chemicals produced from the biomass, furfural has been regarded as one of the platform molecules as it can be converted to other valuable products such as furfuryl alcohol (FA) [5,6], tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol [7,8], γ-valerolactone [9,10], pentanediols [11–13], levulinic acid/ester [14] and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran [15], and so on. These chemicals are the important raw materials in polyester, medical and cosmetic manufacturing industry [16–18]. The conversion of furfural to these value-added chemicals involves either the hydrogenation reaction or acid-catalyzed reaction, or both. This requires the development of the catalysts with bi-functional roles. In fact, much effort has been made to the development of bi-functional catalysts [19–21], which possess both the hydrogenation sites and acidic sites for catalyzing both hydrogenation and acid-catalyzed reactions, for catalyzing the conversion of furfural to varied chemicals. Nevertheless, if a catalyst possesses both the hydrogenation sites and acidic sites, the hydrogenation and acid-catalyzed reaction could take place in parallel and, most importantly, be competitive. For the hydrogenation reaction, the noble metals (i.e. Pt and Pd) [22–24] and the transition metals (i.e. Co and Ni) [25–27] serve as the active sites. For acid-catalyzed reaction, the Brønsted acidic sites and Lewis acidic sites on the carrier of the catalyst serve as the catalytic sites. Thus, the carrier of a catalyst plays an important role in determining the distribution of acidic sites on a catalyst. The acidity of a carrier relates to the surface exposed atoms and their configuration. For the oxides, such as ZrO2, their different crystal phases possess distinct abundance of acidic sites [28–30]. Thus, it is possible to adjust the relative abundance/strength of the acidic sites and the hydrogenation sites on the same oxide but with different crystal phases to tailor the activity of the varied types of catalytic sites for conversion of the biomass derived compounds such as furfural, vanillin, etc. Understanding the competition between the acidic sites and hydrogenation sites provides reference information for the optimization of the distribution of the acidic sites and hydrogenation sites on surface of bi-functional catalysts. In this study, zirconias with different crystal phases were prepared and used as the carrier for the preparation of Cu–ZrO2 catalysts for hydrogenation of furfural, vanillin, etc. Zirconias with different crystal phases might affect the distribution of the acidic sites, while metallic Cu species show reasonable catalytic activity in hydrogenation of CO bond in organics [21]. The results showed that both the calcination temperature and the presence of the Cu species shifted the zirconia with tetragonal phase to the monoclinic phase. The monoclinic zirconia supported copper catalyst (Cu–ZrO2-M) exhibited superior catalytic activity to that of the tetragonal or tetragonal/monoclinic mixed zirconia supported copper catalysts (Cu–ZrO2-T, Cu–ZrO2-T+M) for the conversion of furfural or vanillin via hydrogenation. The abundant Brønsted acidic sites over the Cu–ZrO2-T governed the conversion of furfural via the acid-catalyzed routes, even though the dispersion of metallic Cu sites over the Cu–ZrO2-T was higher. The metallic Cu sites over the Cu–ZrO2-M made hydrogenation the dominant reaction for the conversion of furfural or vanillin. The acidic sites over the Cu–ZrO2 catalyst dominated the conversion of furfural or vanillin if they are abundant."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Zirconyl chloride octahydrate (ZrOCl2·8H2O), vanillin and eugenol were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Copper nitrate, ammonium hydroxide solution and ethanol were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China). Furfural and FA were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical technology Co., Ltd. All reagents used in this study were analytical grade and were used directly without further pretreatment."
3,Catalysts synthesis,"2.2 Catalysts synthesis 2.2.1 Synthesis of zirconia Zirconia was synthesized with a precipitation method. Typically, zirconyl chloride octahydrate was selected as the zirconium source, which was firstly dissolved in water to form a solution. Ammonium hydroxide solution was used as the precipitant and added dropwise to the above solution to form the precipitate. The pH of the solution in the process was maintained at 10.0 ± 0.5. After that, the mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature, and then the precipitate was filtered and washed until the filtrate was neutral and no chloridion was detected by the argentum nitricum solution. The collected sample was further dried at 100 °C overnight, and then grounded thoroughly. After that, zirconias with different crystal phases were obtained by calcination at different temperatures. Specifically, zirconia with tetragonal phase was obtained by calcination at 400 °C. Zirconia of the mixture of tetragonal and monoclinic phases was obtained by calcination at 600 °C, while zirconia with monoclinic phase was obtained by calcination at 700 °C. 2.2.2 Synthesis of zirconia supported copper catalysts The prepared zirconia was further used as the carrier for the synthesis of Cu-based catalyst via wet impregnation method, and the loading of Cu was 20%. Generally, a certain amount of copper nitrate was dissolved into water to form the solution, and then 3 g of zirconia was added to this solution. After that, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 h, and then dried at 100 °C overnight. The dried samples were calcined at 300 °C for 4 h, and then further reduced at 300 °C for 2 h before the catalytic experiment. Finally, the prepared zirconia supported copper catalysts were named as Cu–ZrO2-X, where X represents the crystal phase of zirconia, such as tetragonal (T), tetragonal/monoclinic (T+M) and monoclinic (M) phase of zirconia."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test To evaluate the catalytic performance of the catalyst, the hydrogenation experiments were performed in an autoclave reactor. Typically, the reaction substrate, the catalyst and solvent were loaded into the reactor vessel with a volume of 10 mL and mixed uniformly at room temperature, and then the reactor was purged with high-purity hydrogen for three times. Before the heating, the reactor was charged with hydrogen to the presetting pressure, and then was heated to the reaction temperature within ca. 30 min. The reactor was maintained at the reaction temperature for a certain reaction time, and then was cooled down to room temperature when the experiment finished. After that, the catalyst was separated and collected for the further characterization, and the liquid products were collected for quantitative analysis."
5,Characterizations of the catalysts and the products,"2.4 Characterizations of the catalysts and the products The crystallinity of the prepared samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction spectrometer (XRD, Rigaku Ultima Ⅳ) equipped with a Cu target (K α-radiation source, λ = 1.5406 Å). The scanning angle ranging from 5 to 80° with a scanning rate of 20° min−1 was used. Besides, Debye–Scherrer equation was used to calculate the particle size of metallic Cu species. To measure the specific surface area, pore volume and pore size of the prepared samples, N2 adsorption-desorption characterization was carried out using the instrument of Biaode SSA–6000 at 77 K. The Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method was used for the calculation. Typically, the samples were pretreated at 120 °C for 2 h to remove the physically absorbed moisture before the analysis. The temperature programmed reduction of the calcined samples in hydrogen (H2-TPR) was performed to further probe the reduction behaviors of the calcined samples using a Vodo VDSorb 91x instrument. 20 mg of the sample was used and 5% H2/Ar mixed gas was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The sample was heated from room temperature to 500 °C with a ramping rate of 20 °C min−1, and the signal for the consumption of hydrogen was recorded with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In addition, the reduction degree of copper oxide was calculated based on external standard method. Typically, TPR analysis was performed using the pure CuO sample with various weights to obtain the responding factor, and then the zirconia supported copper sample after the calcination was analyzed to measure the hydrogen consumption and determine the reduction degree. To further characterize the dispersion of Cu species, the calcined samples were further analyzed by N2O chemisorption and H2-TPR reverse titration with a Vodo VDSorb 91x instrument by following the procedures in the reference [21]. Generally, 40 mg of the sample was pretreated at 120 °C for 1 h under a constant Ar flow (40.0 mL min−1), and then cooled down to room temperature. After that, 5% H2/Ar mixed gas (40.0 mL min−1) was used to further reduce the sample by heating from room temperature to 300 °C with a ramping rate of 20 °C min−1. Moreover, Ar gas with a flow rate of 40.0 mL min−1 was further used to treat the sample for 30 min, and then the sample was cooled down to 50 °C for the further oxidation of surface Cu species to Cu2O. The reduced sample was oxidized with a N2O/N2 flow (40.0 mL min−1) for 60 min, and then was further reduced with an H2/Ar flow (40.0 mL min−1) to reduce the Cu2O on the surface of catalyst. The sample was heated from 50 to 300 °C with a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1, and the signal was recorded with a TCD. The surface Cu particles dispersion, particles size and specific surface area were measured according to the previous literature [21]. The acidity of the catalyst was measured with a temperature programmed desorption method (Biaode PCA-1200 instrument) with ammonia as the probing molecule (NH3−TPD). Before the analysis, 100 mg of the sample was heated from room temperature to 150 °C for 30 min with a helium flow rate of 30 mL min−1. After that, NH3 was introduced with a flow rate of 40.0 mL min−1 at 50 °C for the adsorption onto the sample, and then helium with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 was used for removing the physically absorbed NH3 in the sample. After that, the sample was further heated to 700 °C with a ramping rate of 20 °C min−1 under a constant helium flow (30 mL min−1). The desorbed ammonia was recorded by a TCD, and the amounts of acidic sites were further determined. In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) characterization was further performed to determine both Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites on surface of the Cu–ZrO2 catalyst by using a Nicolet iS50 instrument equipped with a modified Harrick Praying Mantis DRIFT cell. Before the analysis, the sample was pretreated at 200 °C for 30 min in vacuum, and then was cooled down to room temperature for recording the background spectrum. Pyridine as the probe molecule was introduced for 30 min, and then the subsequent degassing was carried out with a nitrogen flow (50 mL min−1) for removing the physically absorbed pyridine. After that, the temperature programmed desorption was performed from room temperature to 500 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, and the spectra were simultaneously recorded. To characterize the polymer with π-conjugated structures in the liquid products, synchronous spectra were carried out by using a fluorescence spectrometer (Shimadzu, RF-6000). The initial excitation wavelength was set at 230 nm, remaining 20 nm away from the emission wavelength. The scanning rate was set at 600 nm min−1. The liquid samples were diluted to 400 ppm using ethanol as a solvent before the analysis. The liquid products were further analyzed by using a gas chromatography coupling with a mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Shimadzu GC−MS−QP 2020) equipped with a Wax pillar column (30 m of length, 0.25 mm of internal diameter, 0.25 μm of film thickness). Before the analysis, the liquid products were diluted to ca. 2 wt% with acetone as the solvent. The standard spectra of the National Institute of Standards and Technology library (NIST 2014) were used for the identification of the targeting products. The external standard method was used, and the corresponding factor of standard chemicals was obtained firstly for the quantitative analysis of the target products. The equation below was used for calculating the conversion of the reactant: (1) Conversion ( % ) = Mole of reactant converted Mole of reactant loaded × 100 % The yield of liquid products was defined as follows: (2) Yield ( % ) = Mole of product produced Mole of reactant loaded × 100 %"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalysts characterizations,"3.1 Catalysts characterizations 3.1.1 XRD To investigate the crystal phases of zirconia, the XRD characterization was carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1a shows the diffraction peaks of zirconium dioxides with different crystal phases, such as tetragonal, tetragonal/monoclinic and monoclinic phases of zirconia after the calcination at varied temperatures. The peaks of 2θ at 30.3°, 35.2°, 50.4° and 60.2° were assigned to the (101), (110), (112) and (211) crystal faces of ZrO2 with tetragonal phase (JCPDS 88-1007). The diffraction peaks of 2θ at 28.2°, 31.5°, 34.2°, 35.3°, 40.7°, 50.1°, 50.6° and 54.1° were belonged to the (−111), (111), (002), (200), (−211), (220), (−122) and (202) crystal planes of ZrO2 with monoclinic phase (JCPDS 86-1450), confirming the presence of tetragonal and monoclinic phases of zirconia. The different crystal phases might affect the dispersion of copper species, as is shown in Fig. 1b and c. After the calcination, CuO phase was detected in all Cu–ZrO2 catalysts, and the peaks of 2θ at 35.5°, 38.7° and 68.1° were attributed to the (11-1), (111) and (220) crystal planes of CuO (JCPDS 48-1548). When ZrO2-T and Cu–ZrO2-T impregnated with copper nitrate were calcined at 300 °C, Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst showed the crystal transition from tetragonal phase to monoclinic phase, which can be attributed to the introduction of Cu species and confirmed, as is shown in Fig. S1. The further calcination of ZrO2-T did not result in the crystal transition, but this phenomenon happened in the Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst after the impregnation of copper species. The further reduction of copper oxide with hydrogen did not affect the transition of the crystal phase and resulted in the production of metallic Cu particles, as the peaks of 2θ at 43.3° and 74.1° were assigned to the (111) and (220) crystal faces of metallic copper (JCPDS 04-0836). Obviously, different crystal phases of zirconia affected the distribution of Cu species, which might be induced by the distinct porous structure of ZrO2 of varied crystal phases. This was further investigated with the nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement. 3.1.2 Nitrogen adsorption-desorption Specific surface area, pore volume and pore size of zirconium dioxides and Cu–ZrO2 catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . The obvious differences in terms of the specific surface area and the distribution of the pores were observed among these samples. ZrO2-T catalyst showed the biggest specific surface area but the smallest pore volume. Apparently, the pores in the ZrO2-T catalyst were small in size, as confirmed by the results in Table 1 and Fig. 2 b. The specific area and the pore size of the ZrO2-T+M were in the between of ZrO2-T and ZrO2-M samples (Table 1 and Fig. 2b). The monoclinic phase of ZrO2 could clearly enlarge the pores of the oxide at the expense of specific area. After the impregnation of copper, the specific surface area, pore volume and pore size of Cu–ZrO2 catalysts decreased to the varied extent, due to the blocking of Cu particles to some of the pores. Fig. 2 displays nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and corresponding pore-size distribution of zirconium dioxides and Cu–ZrO2 catalysts. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all samples exhibited type Ⅳ according to International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification, but the hysteresis loop in different catalysts was obviously different. The hysteresis loop of ZrO2-T was H2-type at a low relative pressure ranging from 0.4 to 0.8, confirming the presence of mesoporous structure and ink-bottle pores [31]. Nevertheless, ZrO2-T+M, ZrO2-M and its supported copper catalysts exhibited the hysteresis loop of H3-type, indicating the presence of slit-shaped mesopores and the aggregation of the particles [32,33]. In addition, ZrO2-T and Cu–ZrO2-T catalysts showed a rather concentrated pore size distribution in a range from 2 to 10 nm, and the pore size of Cu–ZrO2-T+M and Cu–ZrO2-M catalysts gradually increased and dispersed in a wider range (Entries 4 to 6 in Table 1). The different crystal phases affected the textural properties of Cu–ZrO2 catalysts, which might also further have influences on the interaction between Cu species and the zirconia carrier, which was further investigated with the H2-TPR characterization. 3.1.3 H2-TPR and N2O chemisorption Fig. 3 displays the reduction behaviors of Cu–ZrO2 catalysts of the varied crystal phases. The reduction degree of CuO was also calculated and is summarized in Table 1. The reduction peak of Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst centered at 238 °C, which was lower than that of Cu–ZrO2-T+M and Cu–ZrO2-M catalysts, indicating a weaker interaction between Cu species and the tetragonal zirconia carrier in Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst or a smaller size of Cu species in Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst [21]. Generally, the catalyst with a bigger pore size might result in the migration of CuO species to form bigger CuO during the calcination process, which can be contacted easily with hydrogen to reduce CuO to Cu but the reduction temperature might be higher, as is shown in Fig. 3. On the contrary, the catalyst with a smaller pore size could suppress the migration or sintering of CuO. The Cu particles with a smaller size can be reduced easily than that with a bigger size, and then the reduction peaks of the Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst centered at a lower temperature (shown in Fig. 3). When the zirconia with monoclinic phase was used as the carrier, the reduction peak shifted to a high temperature. It is worth to note that the reduction degree of Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst was lower than that of the other catalysts, which might be due to the small pore size of Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst, as is shown in Table 1. The Cu particles size dispersed inside the inner pores was difficult to be further reduced to some extents due to the steric hindrance [34], which might result in the lower Cu reduction degree in Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst. Surface Cu particles dispersion, surface area and size of Cu particle obtained from the N2O chemisorptions (Fig. 3b and c) are also shown in Table 1, and the obvious differences were observed. Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst with a higher specific surface area exhibited a higher dispersion of metallic Cu and the higher surface area of metallic copper than that of Cu–ZrO2-T+M and Cu–ZrO2-M catalysts. This was related to the smaller particle size of metallic Cu over the Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst than that over the Cu–ZrO2-M catalyst (1.9 nm versus 5.2 nm). As is shown in Table 1, the particle size of Cu species in the Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst with the tetragonal phase only was the smallest, followed by that in the Cu–ZrO2-T+M catalyst with the mixed phases and was the biggest over the Cu–ZrO2-M catalyst with the monoclinic phase only. Generally, the smaller particle size of Cu is favorable for the catalytic reactions as metallic Cu particles are the active sites for the hydrogenation reactions [21]. The distinct dispersion of Cu over the ZrO2 of varied crystal phases will be further investigated in the catalytic tests. In addition to the effects on the dispersion of metallic copper, the influence of the varied crystal phases of zirconia on the distribution of acidic sites on surface of the catalyst was further investigated. 3.1.4 NH3-TPD and Pyridine-DRIFTS The NH3-TPD characterization was performed to characterize the overall amount of acidic sites while the Pyridine-DRIFTS were performed to characterize the distribution of the Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites. The results were shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2 , respectively. The desorption peaks in the range from 120 to 300 °C belonged to weak acidic sites, the desorption peaks ranging from 300 to 500 °C were attributed to moderate acidic sites and the desorption peaks above 500 °C were attributed to strong acidic sites [21]. The Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst exhibited more abundant acidic sites than other catalysts, especially for acidic sites with weak and moderate strength, which was attributed to the presence of tetragonal zirconia, as is shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2. The amount of the acidic sites over the Cu–ZrO2-T+M catalyst was in the middle while that over the Cu–ZrO2-M catalyst was the lowest. Different crystal phases of zirconia can obviously affect the distribution of acidic sites with different strengths. The distribution of Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites were also closely related to the varied crystal phases of zirconia, as is shown in Fig. 5 . Brønsted acidic sites and Lewis acidic sites were present in all the samples, and the distribution and ratio of Brønsted/Lewis acidic sites were calculated and are shown in Table 2. Cu–ZrO2-T and Cu–ZrO2-T+M catalysts possessed more abundant Brønsted acidic sites and Lewis acidic sites and a higher ratio of Brønsted/Lewis acidic sites. In comparison, fewer amounts of Brønsted acidic sites were observed in Cu–ZrO2-M catalyst. The textural properties, dispersion of copper and distribution of the acidic sites of Cu–ZrO2 catalysts were obviously affected by the different crystal phases of zirconia. This might further affect the potential competition between the hydrogenation sites and acidic sites in the Cu–ZrO2 catalysts for conversion of furfural and other biomass-derived organics, which was further investigated."
8,Catalytic activity,"3.2 Catalytic activity Table 3 displays the distribution of the products in hydrogenation of different reactants over the Cu–ZrO2 catalysts. When the zirconias with different crystal phases were used as the catalyst, the conversion of furfural over ZrO2-T and ZrO2-T+M catalysts at 120 °C was 82.7 and 78.3% (Entries 1 and 2 in Table 3), which were higher than that over ZrO2-M catalyst (Entry 3 in Table 3), and the acetal product from the acetalization of furfural and ethanol was observed, as is shown in Fig. S2. In addition, 2-Ethoxymethyl-furan was also produced as the side-product over ZrO2-T and ZrO2-T+M catalysts, as abundant acidic sites, especially for the Lewis acidic sites, can catalyze the transfer hydrogenation of furfural to FA and Brønsted acidic sites can further catalyze the etherification FA and ethanol to produce 2-ethoxymethyl-furan [16]. The reaction pathways are described in Scheme 1 a. The abundant acidic sites in the ZrO2-T and ZrO2-T+M catalysts were responsible for the acetalization of furfural, as the acetalization reaction was catalyzed by acidic sites [14,35]. In addition, the UV-fluorescence characterization showed the formation of the heavy components with the conjugated π-bond structures [36–38], as is shown in Fig. S3. The acidic sites on the surface of ZrO2 could also catalyze the condensation reactions. With regard to Cu–ZrO2 catalysts, the conversion of furfural reached 100.0% over Cu–ZrO2-M catalyst, and FA was produced as the targeting product (Entry 6 in Table 3). It is worth to note that Cu–ZrO2-T and Cu–ZrO2-T+M catalysts were inclined to catalyze the conversion of furfural to acetal product or 2-ethoxymethyl-furan rather than FA (as is shown in Figs. S2 and S3), indicating that hydrogenation and acetalization of furfural were competitive. The abundant acidic sites over the Cu–ZrO2-T and Cu–ZrO2-T+M catalysts dominated the acid-catalyzed reactions, leaving little chances for the occurrence of the hydrogenation reactions. In comparison, the acidic sites over Cu–ZrO2-M catalyst were less abundant and showed the little effects on the hydrogenation reactions. It needs to note that once furfural reacted with ethanol to form the acetal via the acid catalysis, which would be more difficult to be hydrogenated to FA due to the steric hindrance. In addition, the polymerization of furfural or the acetal formed with the aid of the acidic sites would also deter the formation of FA as the final product. At higher reaction temperature (i.e. 150 °C, Entries 7 to 9 in Table 3), the yield of FA from furfural was improved over the Cu–ZrO2-T and Cu–ZrO2-T+M catalysts. However, the hydrogenation route of furfural was still suppressed due to their abundant acidic sites, even though the dispersion of metallic Cu particles was higher over the Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst. The abundant acidic sites over the Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst dominated the conversion of furfural. As a contrast, the yield of FA over the Cu–ZrO2-M catalyst could be as high as 98.6% (Entry 9 in Table 3), due to the much fewer acidic sites in this catalyst. To further evaluate the competition between the hydrogenation and the acid-catalyzed route, the conversion of vanillin and eugenol was employed. The reaction network for the conversion of vanillin is shown in Scheme 1b and the results are shown in Table 3. As is shown in the Entries 10 to 15 in Table 3, Cu–ZrO2-M catalyst exhibited the superior activity for the production of 2-methoxy-5-methyl-phenol (MMP) from vanillin (Entries 12 and 15 in Table 3). When Cu–ZrO2-T and Cu–ZrO2-T+M were used as the catalysts, the conversion of vanillin was suppressed and 4-(ethoxymethyl)-2-methoxy-phenol (EMP), a product from the etherification between vanillyl alcohol (VA) and ethanol, was formed as the main product. The etherification reaction was also catalyzed with the acidic sites [39,40]. In addition, the further conversion of EMP would also encounter some steric hindrance of the reactants. Eugenol was also used as the reaction substrate. The results showed that Cu–ZrO2-M catalyst was very active for the production of 2-methoxy-4-propyl-phenol (MPP) from eugenol via hydrogenation, the yield of which reached 99.0%. Similarly, the Cu–ZrO2-T+M and Cu–ZrO2-T catalysts were not active for the hydrogenation of eugenol, especially for the Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst with the more abundant acidic sites. The result herein confirmed again that the acidic sites over the Cu–ZrO2-T catalyst dominated the catalytic behaviors, even though the higher dispersion of metallic copper was observed in this catalyst. The superior catalytic activity of the Cu–ZrO2-M catalyst was also further confirmed over other reaction substrates such as benzaldehyde, cuminaldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde, as is shown in Table S1, where the yield of the product produced via the hydrogenation reached ca. 99%. The reusability of the Cu–ZrO2-M catalyst with less acidic sites was further explored."
9,Catalytic reusability,"3.3 Catalytic reusability Fig. 6 shows the reusability of the Cu–ZrO2-M catalyst by using furfural and vanillin respectively as the reactant. For the conversion of furfural, with the increase of cycle times, the yield of FA produced from furfural decreased slightly. In the conversion of vanillin, the yield of MMP only decreased slightly. The catalyst generally maintained the activity. The spent catalysts were characterized with XRD, as is shown in Fig. 7 . No obvious changes were observed in the XRD results of fresh and spent Cu–ZrO2-M catalysts, showing that the Cu–ZrO2-M catalyst could exhibit superior recyclability."
10,Conclusions,"The results indicated that the higher calcination temperature shifted the zirconia from tetragonal phase to the monoclinic phase. Further to this, Cu species could interact with zirconia, which also promoted the shift of zirconia from tetragonal phase to the monoclinic phase. The varied crystal phases of zirconia significantly affected the physicochemical properties and catalytic behaviors of Cu/ZrO2 catalysts. Tetragonal zirconia used as the carrier can effectively enhance the specific surface area, the formation of mesoporous, the dispersion of Cu species, metallic Cu surface area and the overall number of acidic sites, and the relative ratio of the Brønsted acidic sites when compared with monoclinic zirconia as the support. Moreover, acidic sites and hydrogenation sites on surface of the Cu/ZrO2 catalysts were highly competitive during the hydrogenation reaction, and the suitable distribution of them was crucial for achieving the highly efficient hydrogenation of the organics. Monoclinic zirconia supported copper catalyst can exhibit much superior catalytic activity to tetragonal or tetragonal/monoclinic zirconia supported copper catalyst due to its low amounts of acidic sites. The abundant Brønsted acidic sites over the tetragonal zirconia supported copper catalyst catalyzed the acetalization and/or polymerisation of furfural and vanillin, which deterred their conversion via the hydrogenation route. Monoclinic zirconia supported copper catalyst contains less Brønsted acidic sites and thus it predominately catalyzed the hydrogenation reactions. Tailoring the distribution of the hydrogenation sites and acidic sites over the Cu–ZrO2 catalyst modified the product selectivities for the conversion of the biomass-derived compounds like furfural and vanillin. How do the competitiveness of the hydrogenation sites and acidic sites impact the conversion of other organics also deserve particular attention."
