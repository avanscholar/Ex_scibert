0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has been seen as an option to conventional fossil fuels as an energy source with less environmental change, greater conversion efficiency and an acceptable cost [1,2]. There are four major hydrogen production categories: Chemical, electrochemical (water electrolysis; photo electrochemical; halide electrolysis; H2S electrolysis), biological, and thermal technologies [3]. Presently, most hydrogen production methods in the world consume fossil fuel and leads to carbon emissions. Nevertheless, carbon free hydrogen can be developed by using water electrolysis, which is in fact, the most mature method of renewable hydrogen production and thus seen as a key technique in hydrogen energy. The electrolysis based on a proton exchange membrane (PEM) is suitable for portable power applications because it can start up and shut down quickly and can produce hydrogen at a low temperature. It was realized that electrolysis systems based on PEM had a number of advantages in comparison with traditional alkaline water electrolysers, such as ecological cleanliness, a high purity gas and an increased level of safety, much higher volume specific hydrogen capacity and higher efficiency [4]. Nevertheless, water electrolysis has not experienced a substantial commercial impact because it consumes much electricity, which fixes the process economically unattractive [5] and the most employed solid polymer electrolyte is a perfluorinated polymer [6–8] such as nafion which are highly expensive and their disposal when disused can also be expensive because of the presence of fluorine. Moreover, the practical engineering issues of hydrogen production, distribution, compression, safety and public acceptance, limit the large scale adoption of a hydrogen economy. Liquid alcohols could serve as a bridge between gasoline and gaseous hydrogen. They have high energy densities and can be easily stored and passed out through the existing gas infrastructure. It has also been debated that alcohols are the next liquid fuels to use after the depletion of petroleum resources [9]. Methanol is a readily available electro active alcohol, which can be economically mass produced from non-renewable resources such as natural gas, coal, or from renewable resources such as biomass. Generally, both methanol and ethanol are liquid hydrocarbons and ethanol is twice as expensive as methanol [10]. Moreover, most of the biomass processes for bio-ethanol production using food products which have attracted criticism given the increasing food prices and the global food shortage [11]. Alcohols can be used directly in fuel cells to produce electricity or mechanical energy in internal combustion engines. Nevertheless, an alcohol electrochemical reformer or electrolysis can be utilized to create clean hydrogen, which can be applied in other schemes, resulting in an improvement in the overall system functioning. The problems associated with using ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol as a fuel in PEM electrolyser include the difficulty in C–C bond breakage and also the intermediate generation, which increases the energy consumption for hydrogen production and the CO2 emission also increased (Table 1 ). Hydrogen production from methanol electrolysis has lower power consumption than hydrogen production from water electrolysis since the standard voltage for the oxidation of methanol in the liquid phase is only 0.016 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) compared to 1.23 V versus SHE for the oxidation of water. It has been estimated that hydrogen production from the electrolysis of methanol costs about 50% less compared to that of water, even when the cost of methanol is taken into account [10]. Contempt of the aforesaid advantages of this process, but only a few groups is active in this area and limited work has been reported [12–16]. The polymer electrolyte membrane methanol electrolyser cells are based on perfluorocarbon sulfonate ionomers which operate in the 80 °C range, and are likely limited to 125–150 °C. The perfluorinated polymers have three major drawbacks: very high cost; loss of conductivity at high temperature (>80 °C) and high methanol permeability, which hinder their further application [20,21]. In prospect of this, there is a widespread effort being expended to develop alternative more economical non-perfluorinated polymer based PEMs. Many promising polymers are based on aromatic thermoplastics [20,22–24], such as PES, poly (ether ether ketone) (PEEK), polybenzimidazole (PBI), and so forth, which have excellent chemical resistance, high thermo-oxidative stability, good mechanical properties and low cost. By the attachment of sulfonic groups to the polymer chains of PEEK [20,22–27], PES [28,29], polyimides [30,31] and PBI [32,33] were applied as PEM materials. The interest in the ontogeny of this form of membranes as PEM is based along its high oxidative and thermal stability [34], while their role in direct methanol fuel cells relies on their low methanol crossover [35]. Hydrogen production by methanol electrolysis is also a field of potential interest for these membranes. Among the potential alternatives, SPES is apparently the best material to be used as a PEM for methanol electrolyser because of their advantages of low cost, easy preparation, controllable composition, good mechanical strength and high chemical and thermal stabilities. Sulfonation of PES can also be performed by the chemical modification method and negatively charged sulfonic groups can be chemically introduced into PES backbone using chlorosulfonic acid or sulfuric acid as a sulfonating agent [36]. Moreover, to the best of our understanding, no work has been reported on the performance of a SPES based membrane for methanol electrolyser applications. Thus, the present work is focussed to synthesize the SPES membrane and the fabricated membranes were characterized for its morphological, thermal and electrochemical properties. The effects of various factors which influence the membrane and electrode fabrication were also studied. The membrane performance in producing clean hydrogen at a higher rate through aqueous methanol electrolysis and the various parameters which influence it, has been demonstrated."
1,Experimental,
2,Membrane fabrication,"2.1 Membrane fabrication Polyethersulfone (PES) (Gafone 3200P, Mw 123 kDa), procured from Gharda Chemicals Limited (India) was subjected to sulfonation reaction using concentrated sulfuric acid and chlorosulfonic acid to obtain SPES as described in our previous study [37]. A pre-determined quantity of SPES was weighed and dissolved as such in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to prepare a 20 wt% membrane dope solution. The prepared solution was then ultrasonicated before being decanted onto a petri dish and held on in an oven at 110 °C for 24 h and further treated at 80 °C in a vacuum oven until complete evaporation of the residual solvent. The fabricated membrane was then cooled to room temperature and took-off from the glass plate with deionised water. Further usage of the membrane was carried out by immersing it in 1 M sulfuric acid and rinsing with deionised water, ahead it was stored in deionised water for later experiments."
3,Membrane characterization,"2.2 Membrane characterization Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry (Perkin–Elmer Spectrum one) was employed to distinguish the presence of the sulfonic acid group in polymer samples. It was also used to observe the interactions between SPES polymer and solvent in the membrane. Spectra were obtained in the range of 4000–500 cm−1 in absorbance mode. The morphological characteristics of the fabricated membrane were examined with the use of scanning electron microscope (JEOL-6340F). The tensile strength of the membranes was evaluated with the help of Universal Testing Machine (UTM) possessing a load cell of 5 kN, at ambient temperature. The gauge length and breadth of all membranes were 50 mm and 5 mm, respectively. Trials were conducted with a constant strain rate of 10 mm/min and up to failure of the sample. The thermal stability of the membrane was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a heating rate of 10 ºC/min under nitrogen atmosphere. The ion exchange capacity (IEC) of the membrane was determined by an acid-base titration method [38] from which the extent of sulfonation of membrane was also calculated using the relation Degree of sulfonation ( DS ) = 0.244 [ M ( NaOH ) × V ( NaOH ) ] W – 0.081 [ M ( NaOH ) × V ( NaOH ) ] × 100 The proton conductivity of the membrane was determined by an AC impedance technique using an Autolab Potentiostat/Galvanostat electrochemical analyser over a frequency range of 1–107 Hz to 50–500 mV oscillating voltage. The membranes were previously hydrated by immersion for 24 h at room temperature. The conductivity, σ, was calculated from the impedance data, using the relation σ = l R S where l and S are the thickness and cross-section area of the membrane, respectively, and R was derived from the intersection of the characteristic spike on a complex impedance plane temperature with the Re(z)-axis. The methanol transmission flux was obtained from diffusion experiments. The transmission measuring device [39] was a vertical membrane separated diffusion cell, consisting of two compartments with a capacity of approximately 60 cm3. The solution in each compartment was stirred during the experiment to minimize the boundary layer formation. Initially, one compartment (A) contains deionized water and the other compartment (B) was filled with 1 M methanol water solution. The methanol flux aroused across the membrane interface as an upshot of the concentration difference in both compartments. The increase in concentration of methanol with respect to time in a compartment (B) was determined by monitoring the refractive index value with the help of refractometer (Abbe NAR 3T). Finally the methanol permeability was calculated from the slope of a plot between the methanol concentration and diffusion time, using the following equation: C B ( t ) = A ( DK ) C A ( t − t 0 ) V B L Where, CA and CB are the concentrations of methanol in compartments A and B and VB is the volume of compartment B. ‘A’ and ‘L’ are the area and thickness of the membrane, and D and K are the methanol diffusivity and partition coefficient, respectively. The product of DK is the membrane permeability. All experiments were carried out at room temperature."
4,MEA fabrication and testing,"2.3 MEA fabrication and testing The SPES based MEAs were fabricated by using the decal method [40] and the MEAs were made with five layers including anode gas diffusion layer (GDL), anode catalyst layer (CL), electrolyte membrane, cathode catalyst layer, and cathode GDL. Pt catalyst supported on carbon (20% Pt/C, from E-Tek USA) and Pt–Ru alloy supported on carbon (40% Pt–Ru/C from E-Tek, USA) were used as a cathode catalyst and anode catalyst, respectively. The catalyst slurry for anode and cathode were prepared by mixing the catalyst powders, water, isopropyl alcohol and 5wt% SPES in NMP solution. The mixture was stirred ultrasonically for 60 min to obtain a homogeneous suspension. Then the prepared catalyst pastes were spread on a homemade gas diffusion layer (micro porous layer coated carbon cloth) with the platinum loading of 0.5 mg/cm2 for cathode and 3.0 mg/cm2 for anode. The membrane was positioned between the two catalysts-loaded sheets of carbon cloth, with their catalyst sides facing the membrane. The sandwich was clamped between two fibre reinforced silicone rubber sheets and hot pressed at 170 °C and 10 MPa for 90 s on all directions equally. The MEA thus obtained was ready to use in constructing a single methanol electrolysis cell of 5 cm2 area. This study used a single cell for the experiments. Setup of the tested hydrogen production cell, including end plates, gaskets, collectors, separators, and MEA is schematically shown in Fig. 1 . The MEA was placed between two Teflon coated fiber reinforced gaskets of thickness 0.22 mm and inserted between two platinised titanium plates with straight parallel grooves as a flow field area at the centre. Platinized titanium mesh of thickness 0.2 mm, was stationed along both positions of the MEA for effective current collection and uniform gas distribution. The aforesaid components were clamped together using nuts and bolts by applying uniform tightening torque. The electrolysis was conducted by applying electric current using a DC power supply having constant current and constant voltage mode provisions to the electrolyser to generate hydrogen at the cathode. The temperature of the cell was controlled by using heating coil which was evaluated with a thermocouple. The electrochemical performance of the MEA in methanol electrolyser was evaluated with a single cell having an active area of 5 cm2 and feeding an aqueous methanol solution into the anode using a peristaltic pump. Hydrogen production rate was calculated from the cell current and was cross examined by gas volume measurement. Before analysing the purity of hydrogen, it was run through an activated charcoal trap in order to get rid of the methanol vapour and then through the silica gel trap to get rid of the moisture content. The purity of hydrogen gas was checked by using calibrated hydrogen purity analyser (NOVA Gas Analyzer)."
5,Determination of the electrical characteristics of the methanol electrolysis in a PEMEC,"2.4 Determination of the electrical characteristics of the methanol electrolysis in a PEMEC Electrolysis of aqueous methanol was carried out in a PEMEC which was fabricated in our lab. The methanol solution of 4 M was fed into the anode compartment with the help of peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 15 cc/min. With acknowledgement of our previous work, we have chosen 4 M methanol as an anode feed. Gangadharan et al [41] has observed only a marginal increase in performance beyond 4 M concentration of methanol. The methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) requires the molecular ratio of water to methanol to be 1:1. Moreover the complete 6 electron oxidation of methanol to CO2 can be completed as the molecular ratio of water to methanol ratio has to be much higher than the stoichiometric 1:1 ratio [42,43]. In contrast, if the water in the anode catalyst layer is insufficient, the MOR will be incomplete to either formic acid or formaldehyde as shown in CH3OH + H2O → HCOOH + 4H+ + 4e- CH3OH → HCHO + 2H+ + 2e- Hence, if the low methanol concentration is given to the PEM methanol electrolysis, the molecular proportion of water to methanol is much more eminent than the stoichiometric 1:1 ratio. Consequently, the formation of either formic acid or formaldehyde as an intermediate species during the MOR can be neglected."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Physical characterization of membrane,"3.1 Physical characterization of membrane 3.1.1 FTIR The presence of sulfonic acid groups in prepared SPES membrane was confirmed by FTIR spectra as shown in Fig. 2 . The peaks at 1580 cm−1 and 1490 cm−1 are attributed to vibration of the aromatic ring skeleton, whereas that around 1232–1234 cm−1, are primarily due to the presence of aryl oxide. The characteristic peaks of aromatic SO3 – stretching vibrations were observed at 1071 and 1008 cm−1, respectively, which were absent in PES. Similarly the absorption bands at 3575 cm−1 for SPES membrane also represents the stretching of the hydroxyl group of SO3H group [44]. The absorption peak at 1028 cm−1 is characteristic of the aromatic SO3H symmetric stretching vibration, strongly indicating the presence of SO3H group in SPES membrane. From the result, it was affirmed that the prepared ion exchange membranes had a sulfonic group for exchanging the protons. 3.1.2 Morphology The performance of SPES membrane should be closely related to its internal structure, mainly its morphology. Fig. 3 shows the surface morphology (a) and cross sectional image (b) of SPES membrane. The micrograph did not show any evidence of the presence of micro porous structure. The production of non-porous structure is due to the fabrication technique of the membrane itself. The method we adopted for membrane fabrication was a dry phase inversion technique which involves slow solvent evaporation for more than a day [45]. Broadly speaking, the membrane fabricated by the dry phase inversion method is in a dense structure due to the slow movement of solvent molecules when it is vaporized from the polymer membrane. The PEMEC system resumes dense membrane, as a porous membrane tends to allow methanol and water to permeate through it. The surface morphology in terms of roughness would be explored by employing Atomic force microscope (AFM) which is depicted by the Fig. 4 and the data is presented in Table 2 . The image clearly shows the surface of the membrane has nodular structures due to the presence of aggregates of sulfonic acid groups after sulfonation. The nodular structures can work as an efficient channel for proton conduction and as well aid in holding water, which plays as a gelation medium to enable efficient proton conduction. 3.1.3 Mechanical stability The mechanical properties of the membrane are studied by determining the tensile strength. The incorporation of –SO3H group on the aromatic ring of PES increased the tensile strength of the matrix polymer due to effective stress transfer between PES and –SO3H group. The higher tensile strength is likely referable to the increased intermolecular association through the polar ionic sites and also caused by the restriction of mobility of polymer chains caused by the addition of sulfonic acid group. The data in Table 3 indicates that the tensile strength of SPES membrane is 39.8 MPa, which is a lot higher than Nafion 117 (15 MPa). This is imputable to the highly rigid chemical structure in the sulfonated aromatic polymers (low chain mobility) compared to a high chain mobility in the semi-crystalline rubber-like structure of perfluorinated aliphatic polymers such as Nafion [46]. Thus the mechanical properties of the SPES membrane are strong enough for the PEM based electrolysis applications. 3.1.4 Thermal stability Fig. 5 illustrates the thermogravimetric analysis of the prepared SPES membrane in the temperature range from 0 to 700 °C. The parent PES is an excellent thermo-stable polymer which decomposes at high temperature around 460 °C [47]. In that respect, there are three step weight loss in case of SPES including the loss of absorbed water at 100 °C, the thermal decomposition of SO3H groups at 300 °C [36] and the degradation of polymer chains around near 500 °C. Considering the mild operating temperature for methanol electrolysis applications, the thermal properties of the SPES membrane are satisfactory for the pertain requirement of PEMEC which operates above 80 °C. 3.1.5 Ion exchange capacity (IEC) and degree of sulfonation Acid base titration method was used to determine the IEC, which indicates the charge density in the membranes from which the sulfonation degree of SPES membrane was calculated. Pure membranes were equilibrated with a 3 M sodium chloride solution; the protons were exchanged by sodium cations and then titrated with a 0.01 M sodium hydroxide solution. The value of IEC of the prepared membrane is given in Table 3. To achieve highest possible IEC which makes certain good proton conductivity and thus good electrolytic performance, the SPES membrane with a high degree of sulfonation could be formed by increasing the reaction time and the ratio of sulfonating agent. Sulfonation and ion exchange capacity, both are known to augment hydrophilicity by introducing the sulfonic acid groups. The utmost degree of sulfonation (DS) we could get was 60% with an ion exchange capacity value of 1.8 meq/gm. This increased DS and IEC indicate high hydrophilicity of the membrane. However, the membranes with higher DS were found to start dissolving in hot water. As water is given to associate powerfully with the ionic groups in the polymer membrane, it is clearly understandable that high degree of sulfonation in SPES resulted in increased swelling of the membrane in water. Extremely high levels of water uptake can result in membrane fragility and dimensional change leading to failures in mechanical properties. What is concerning about these polymeric membranes is that their swelling degree is quite sensitive to the extent of the sulfonation level in SPES. The SPES membrane with a degree of sulfonation higher than 40% sustained in cold water, but could not be endured in hot water and lost its mechanical strength. An appropriate membrane for methanol electrolysis would be one having moderate swelling degree at operating temperature to maintain ample mechanical strength to encounter the various parameters in MEA fabrication. With this guide and based on the ion exchange capacity and the degree of sulfonation data of these membranes, we opted membrane with 35% DS in SPES polymer to make MEA in methanol electrolysis."
8,Electrochemical characterization of membrane,"3.2 Electrochemical characterization of membrane 3.2.1 Proton conductivity and methanol permeability In the present study, although SPES membrane with 60% DS showed an optimum ion exchange capacity, the same has not been taken into account due to its higher water solubility. Higher levels of sulfonation will provide higher proton conductivity; while highly hydrophilic samples would swell greatly yielding a hydrogel and may become weak and do not efficiently serve as a barrier in an electrolysis cell. Hence the membrane with lesser DS has been taken for measurement of conductivity. The optimum conductivity obtained in SPES membrane with 35% DS exhibited a value of 3.67 × 10−3 S/cm. Most of the research work focused on the microstructure of sulfonic acid group containing polymers has demonstrated that microphase separation comprised of hydrophilic regions and hydrophobic regions existed in their membranes. Polar sulfonic acid groups are combined to form ionic clusters. The hydrophilic regions made up by the ionic clusters are in the main responsible for water absorption and the hydrophobic regions made up by the polymer backbone provide dimensional and mechanical stabilities to the PEM. With low DS, the amount of absorbed water is low and most of them is located around the ionic clusters, which are not well linked. The narrow channels formed between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases and rich branches with dead-end “pockets” in SPES membrane was believed to contribute to the higher hindrance to transfer the proton [23]. Since the ionic clusters in SPES membranes are not well connected, so there is no incessant passageway for methanol/water transport through the membrane, leading to lower measured methanol permeability. The performance loss due to the lower proton conductivity of the SPES membrane is partially counterbalanced by the advantage gained through the alleviated methanol cross over. However the Nafion membrane which has the propensity to allow more methanol to pass through it, due to its wider ionic channels between the well unified ionic domains. The methanol permeability of SPES membrane (12.2 × 10−8 cm2/s) is much lower than that of Nafion 117 membrane (3.5 × 10−6 cm2/s) [48], which is the enviable feature to be applied as a PEM in the methanol electrolyser cell. 3.2.2 Influence of operating voltage It is well known that the power required for electrolysis is directly proportional to the applied cell voltage and current. Hence the electrolyser performance was evaluated at various voltages by measuring the current density and hydrogen production rate. The methanol electrolyser system with single cell was operated at 30 °C using 4 M methanol and the results were summarized in the Fig. 6 which compares the cell voltage and current density with the rate of hydrogen production. It is obvious that cell voltage in methanol electrolysis is much smaller than that of water electrolysis due to the lower decomposition potential of methanol on Pt–Ru electrocatalyst [13]. Analyzing the dependence of cell voltage and current efficiency, we compared the energy requirements necessary to produce the same amount of hydrogen. According to our experiments, on the basis of 500 mA/cm2 operation with Pt–Ru catalysts, the methanol electrolysis can proceed at an effective potential of 1.06 V with an energy consumption of 2.53 kWh/Nm3 of hydrogen at 30 °C. This is much lesser than commercial water electrolyser employed with membrane based on Nafion and non-fluorinated polymers [49]. The methanol electrolyser cell equipped with Nafion based MEA exhibited a higher performance and it has reached a current density of 1 A/cm2 at 30 °C [42], while, SPES based MEA reached 0.64 A/cm2current density at the same operating temperature. This is rather anticipated since the perfluorinated system makes easy proton dissociation and permits the establishment of a good interface with the electrodes. However the performance gap has not looked that much excessive and the perspectives of SPES membrane appear good in view of their lower cost and simple chemistry. 3.2.3 Influence of temperature Fig. 7 shows the influence of operating temperature on the methanol electrolyser cell. As seen in Fig. 7 the current densities at the cell temperature of 80 °C are found to be significantly higher than those at the cell temperature of 30 °C when the same voltages are applied. The cell voltage of methanol electrolyser operated at 0.5 A/cm2 is 0.879 V and it attained maximum current density (0.802 A/cm2) at a cell voltage of 1.2 V at 80 °C. The corresponding electrical energy required for methanol electrolysis in the above said current densities were 2.1 kWh/Nm3 and 2.87 kWh/Nm3 respectively, which is very low when compared with water electrolysis. The gradual increase of cell voltage at each current density in the case of water electrolysis seems to indicate that heat management becomes more critical due to its inherent higher cell voltage. Firstly, with increasing temperature, the kinetic energy of the reaction and the catalytic activity are enhanced decreasing activation overvoltage, while the energy difference resulting from the Gibbs free energy of products and reactants in the reaction is decreased towards the negative side (i.e. the reaction tends to occur spontaneously). Because of this, the activation resistance is reduced at higher temperature. In addition, the surface tension of aqueous solution decreases at higher temperature [50]. The lower surface tension would allow more aqueous methanol solution to diffuse through the anode catalyst layer, thus reducing the diffusion resistance of reactant. Due to these facts, the reaction resistance which includes activation resistance and diffusion resistance is reduced significantly at higher temperature. Secondly, it is known that the water uptake increases with temperature, resulting in higher water content in the membrane [51] which in turn conductivity also increases with temperature. The increase in water content and ion conductivity results in lower ionic resistance of the membrane, thus the cell resistance is reduced at higher temperature. The above analysis suggests that the reduction in ionic resistance of the membrane and reaction resistance can be the reasons for the improved current density, which in turn the hydrogen production performance at higher cell temperature. 3.2.4 Durability test for methanol electrolysis cell The good proton conductivity with low methanol crossover of SPES membrane allowed the achievement of excellent methanol electrolysis performance: yet this is not the only property that has to be considered for a large scale diffusion of these membranes. Long-term durability is also an important feature for sulfonated aromatic polymer membranes. Consequently, to confirm the suitability and durability of SPES membranes for methanol electrolysis applications, a short durability test was held out at 0.5 A/cm2 current density at 40 °C and 80 °C temperature for 35 h Fig. 8 depicts the behaviour of cell voltage on time as a function of current density of the methanol electrolyser cell. At low temperature the cell voltage remained constant throughout the test while at high temperature there was a slight increment in the cell voltage was observed after 10 h. This might be ascribable to the slight reduction in tensile strength of SPES membrane when exposed to solvent as well as high temperature environments. The decrease in tensile strength reduces the mechanical stability of SPES based MEA during the operation which reduces the electrolyser performance. While achieving comparable performance in methanol electrolysis, the MEA based on SPES should cost much less than that based on Nafion. This would enable a more economically competitive hydrogen production by solid polymer electrolyte methanol electrolysis. To realize this goal, however, further research and improvement is needed, including membrane preparation, MEA fabrication, MEA active area scale-up and stability experiments."
9,Conclusions,"Non-fluoro polymer, SPES was employed to substitute Nafion membrane for hydrogen production by solid polymer electrolyte methanol electrolysis. The main task regarding PEMs is to develop substitute materials that are as conductive as Nafion, but cheaper, more potent, and more immune to fuel crossover. In these circumstances, this newly developed PEM was able to give crucial insight in the search for better membranes, because it possessed diverse advantages over Nafion membrane, such as lesser affinity to fuel crossover, and lower cost. The good performance was confirmed by the electrolyser cell test at 80 °C with the current density of 0.806 mA/cm2 at a cell voltage of 1.2 V. The increase in cell temperature, improved the hydrogen production performance in the PEM methanol electrolyser cell due to the decrease in ionic resistance of the membrane and reaction resistance. The cell also showed good durability at low temperature under a constant current density within a period of up to 35 h. The experimental results suggest that SPES membrane could be an effective alternative to costly perflurosulfonate membranes in solid polymer electrolyte based methanol electrolysis for hydrogen production."
