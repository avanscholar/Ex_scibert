0,Introduction,"Two stage anaerobic digestion (i.e. acidogenic–methanogenic) is a promising technology for generating biogases (i.e. hydrogen and methane) from concentrated organic substrates such as food wastes. If correctly operated, the first stage of these systems can achieve several objectives including hydrolysis, acidification, and hydrogen gas production. Enhancing production of hydrogen gas is of interest because of its value in the alternative energy economy. In addition, the performance of the acidogenic reactor in a two stage system can impact on the design and operation of the downstream methanogenic reactor. Enhanced hydrolysis and acidogenesis in the first stage will reduce residence time requirements in the downstream reactor. The performance of acidogenic digesters is known to be a function of pH (Fang and Liu, 2002). The pH conditions impact on the rate of hydrolysis, the types and quantities of acidogenic products and rate and extent of H2 generation (Li and Fang, 2007). The establishment of appropriate pH conditions in acidogenic reactors that are operated for H2 gas production is made complex by the fact that these digesters are often operated in a batch or semi-batch mode to minimize the establishment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the digester and hence increase hydrogen yields (Chen et al., 2002). The transient nature of batch operations presents a challenge with respect to establishing the appropriate pH range during the digestion. Acid formation during fermentation will act to depress the pH; however, the pH affects the types and quantities of acids that are generated. Hence, there is a natural feedback between digester pH and acid generation. On-line pH monitoring with addition of acid and base into operating biological reactors is challenging to implement in practice. An alternate approach is to supplement the feedstock with sufficient buffer to counteract pH decreases that result from the generation of organic acids during batch digestion. The latter operating procedure was explored in this study. This study focused on identifying the impact of the initial pH and feedstock buffer supplementation on enhanced hydrogen production from batch acidogenic digestion of food waste. The impact of these variables on the properties of the digester effluent was also characterized to facilitate an assessment of the impact of the acidogenic stage operation on the design and operation of a subsequent methanogenic stage."
1,Methods,"The FW was collected from a cafeteria for 10 consecutive days and sorted manually, removing any non-food particles. The FW consisting of a variety of grains, vegetables and meats, was homogenized using a Waring blender to obtain uniform slurry. The slurry was allotted to 2.5L containers and stored at −70°C for future use. The FW feedstock was prepared from the frozen FW slurry. The frozen slurry was thawed, diluted with water and strained through a No. 40 mesh sieve. Ten milliliters of water were added per gram of slurry to obtain a VS concentration of approximately 10g/L. The resulting feedstock was used for all of the following experiments. A hydrogen producing inoculum was cultivated from a digested municipal wastewater treatment sludge using a sucrose medium as described previously (Zhu and Béland, 2006). In the current study, some modifications were made during the cultivation. The cultivation was conducted in a respirometer (AER-200, Challenge Technology, USA) instead of in an incubator with a reciprocal shaker as employed in the previous study. Sucrose medium (100ml) and 25ml of digested sludge were added to a 250mL serum bottle. The serum bottle was placed in a water bath at 35°C, and connected to a bubble counter through a silicon tube and a 24-gauge syringe needle to record the gas production. The solution in the bottle was agitated by a magnetic stirrer at 250rpm and the cultivation period continued for approximately 16h. The quality of the inoculum was evaluated by measurement of the hydrogen production during the digestion period. All of the inoculum used in this research produced over 300ml of biogas (containing 40–50% v/v hydrogen) from each serum bottle during digestion. Subsequent acidogenic digestion tests with food waste were conducted in the respirometer utilizing a method that was similar to that employed to cultivate the hydrogen producing inoculum. 100mL of FW feedstock and 25mL of hydrogen producing inoculum, were added to each batch digester (250mL). The initial pH of the mixtures was adjusted with 1M NaOH and 1M HCl solutions as required. After pH adjustment, different amount of two phosphate buffer solutions (1M K2HPO4 and 1M KH2PO4) were added to the digester according to the initial pH and the buffer dosage set for this digester. The ratio of concentrations of the two pH buffer salts required in order to maintain a particular pH was calculated as per Henderson–Hasselbalch equation (Sawyer et al., 2003). The ranges of initial pH and buffer addition tested were 6–8 and 0–20mmol/g VS, respectively. All tests were repeated two or three times and some of the individual samples were also duplicated within the runs. The pH buffering capacity of the FW, as determined based on its total acidity and alkalinity, were examined using an acid–base titration method (APHA, 2004). Fifty milliliters of the feedstock solution was added to a 100mL beaker, stirred with a magnetic stirrer, and titrated with either 1M HCl or 1M NaOH. The pH change of the sample was monitored using a pH meter (30 Barnant, USA). The total acidity and alkalinity were computed from the titration curves. The pH end points used for acidity and alkalinity calculations were 9.0 and 4.5, respectively. The hydrogen content of the biogas was measured using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 3000, Wilmington, DE, USA), according to the instruction of manufacturer. The gas chromatograph was equipped with MolSieve 5A and PLOT U columns operating in parallel; and the temperature, carrier gas type and flow rate in the two columns were controlled separately. The MolSieve 5A column was used for the measurement of hydrogen and methane and operated at an injector temperature of 95°C, a column temperature of 100°C, using argon as the carrier gas, at 30 ψ. The PLOT U column was used for measurement of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide and operated at an injector temperature of 70°C, a column temperature of 70°C, using helium as carrier gas, at 15 ψ. Each column was connected to a separated TCD for detection. The concentration of carbohydrates in the culture liquid was determined using the anthrone method (Gaudy, 1962). Total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), total COD (tCOD), soluble COD (sCOD), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and dissolved PO4–P were measured according to standard methods (APHA, 2004). The COD analysis adopted the closed reflex colorimetric method using potassium dichromate as oxidant. The TKN analysis used a semi-micro-Kjeldahl method and the automated phenate method was used for final ammonia analysis. The vanadomolybo-phosphoric acid method was used for colorimetric determination of dissolved PO4–P. Alcohols in the liquid sample were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (5890 Series II Plus GC, Hewlett Packard, Wilmington, DE, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a Restek Stabilwax-DA (30m×0.25mm) capillary column according the manufacturer’s instruction. Hydrogen carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2mL/min was used at a column pressure of 0.77kg/cm2. VFAs were analyzed using an Ion Chromatograph (ICS-2000, Dionex, CA, USA) equipped with a AS15 column at a temperature of 30°C with a gradient carrier solution (8–60mM KOH), according to the instruction of manufacturer."
2,Results and discussions,
3,Characteristics of FW,"3.1 Characteristics of FW The characteristics of the FW feedstock are presented in Table 1 . TS and VS concentrations averaged 11.4 and 10.5g/L, respectively, indicating that a majority of the solid content was organic matter. Soluble COD represented approximately 50% of the total COD, indicating that the organic matter was approximately equally distributed between the particulate phase and soluble phase. The concentration of carbohydrates in the liquid phase was approximately 4.5g/L which counted for 42% of the VS, showing that a majority of the organic matter (more than 80%) in this food waste was composed of carbohydrates. Total TKN and dissolved PO4–P were determined at 505 and 45mg/L, respectively, indicating a COD:N:P ratio of 430:11:1 which was deemed to be sufficient for anaerobic digestion (Tay et al., 2003). The FW feedstock had a relatively low pH buffering capacity as indicated by acidity and alkalinity values of 340 and 40mg CaCO3/L respectively. Given the relatively high organic matter content of the food waste and hence the potential for elevated VFA concentrations during acidogenic digestion it was apparent that the pH buffering capacity of the waste would likely be insufficient to maintain the initial pH during digestion."
4,Effect of buffer and initial pH on hydrogen production from FW,"3.2 Effect of buffer and initial pH on hydrogen production from FW A preliminary experiment that measured hydrogen production and the corresponding changes in pH over the course of a batch digestion was conducted using FW feedstocks with and without buffer addition starting at an initial pH of 7.0. The results are shown in Fig. 1 . Without buffer addition, a negligible quantity of hydrogen was produced and the pH decreased from 7 to 4.0 in the initial 3h. However when 10mmol/g VS was added, hydrogen was actively evolved and prolonged for over 25h, and the yield was 28mL/g VS added. The pH dropped from 7.0 to approximately 6.4 in the initial 3h and continued to drop slowly to 6 over the next 20h. This experiment demonstrated that without the addition of buffer, the pH in the digester contents decreased rapidly and the acidic conditions formed during the digestion without buffer addition likely suppressed hydrogen production. When 10mmol/g VS buffer was added however, the pH drop was moderate and thus favorable conditions for hydrogen production resulted. The results indicate that a majority of the hydrogen production occurred during a period of relatively stable pH that was relatively close to the final pH. The effect of buffer addition on hydrogen production was further examined under different initial pH conditions. The values of the cumulative hydrogen production versus time at different initial pHs and buffer concentrations was regressed using the modified Gompertz model (Lay et al., 1999) and the maximum hydrogen yield from the calibrated model was used to estimate the maximum hydrogen yield from a batch digestion. Fig. 2 presents the maximum hydrogen yield and the final pH versus buffer dosage for the differing initial pH values. The standard deviations were calculated from the observations obtained from repeated experiments and duplicate samples. The relationship between hydrogen production and buffer addition varied with the initial pH (Fig. 2a). At an initial pH of 6, insignificant hydrogen production (less than 1mL/g VS) was observed regardless of the amount of buffer added. At an initial pH of 6.5, significant hydrogen production (greater than 27mL/g VS) was observed for buffer dosages above 10mmol/g VS, reaching a maximum of approximately 120mL/g VS with buffer additions of 15 and 20mmol/g VS. When the initial pH was further increased, a lower buffer concentration was required to achieve substantial hydrogen production (greater than 27mL/g VS). With the exception of an initial pH of 6.5, the hydrogen production increased with buffer concentration to a maximum value then decreased when the buffer concentration was further increased. Fig. 2b shows the final pH observed in each experiment. In all cases where low hydrogen production was observed, the final pH of the digester was also found to be low (i.e. 4.5) (also see Fig. 2a). When the initial pH was 6.0, the final pH was as low as 4.1–4.6 regardless of the amount of buffer added to the mixture. The final pH was also low (4.1–4.4) when no buffer was added regardless of the initial pH. Significant hydrogen production was observed when the final pH was typically around 5.5 and higher, although its production varied at final pH levels higher than 5.5. A plot of hydrogen production (average values of different experiments) versus final pH is presented in Fig. 3 . It shows that hydrogen production increased with the final pH until peak values were observed in the pH range of 5.5–6.0 and then decreased with further increases in pH. It is interesting to note that in the pH range where the maximum hydrogen production was observed (5.5–6.0) there was also the greatest deviations from the general trend previously described. The results indicate that hydrogen production is quite sensitive to other conditions such as initial pH and buffering capacity in the optimal production range. The buffer required for optimal hydrogen production under different initial pH conditions was of interest. Fig. 4 presents the maximum hydrogen yield and corresponding buffer addition for a range of initial pH values. With the exception of when the initial pH was 6.0 where buffer addition of 20mmol/g VS was insufficient to maintain the pH in the optimal range, the buffer requirement for maximum hydrogen production decreased with the increase of the initial pH. However, the maximum hydrogen yield also decreased with the increase of the initial pH. As will be subsequently demonstrated, the biochemical pathways changed as a function of the pH conditions in the digesters. Hence, the yields of acids (and hydrogen) varied thereby impacting upon the dosage of buffer that was required to obtain the optimal hydrogen generation. The results of this study provide valuable information on the quantities of buffer that would be required to maximize hydrogen generation and acidogenesis in the first stage of an acid–gas digestion system. The maximum hydrogen yield obtained was approximately 120mL/g VS added which was higher than those reported by Kataoka et al. (2005) (100mL/g VS) and Kim et al. (2004) (60mL/g VS), but lower than that reported by Lay et al. (1999) (140–180mL/g VS). In the research of Kataoka et al. (2005), a FW with about 6% waste paper was studied, the pH was controlled at 5.0–5.5 by the recycling of a methanogenic reactor effluent and the temperature was in thermophilic range. The studies of Kim et al. (2004) and Lay et al. (1999) were carried out using mixtures of FW and sewage sludge with addition of buffer and mineral salts and at a pH of 5–6. The differences in hydrogen generation between the current and previous studies were attributed to the differences in feed composition and the differing pH conditions under which the digestions were performed."
5,Substrate utilization,"3.3 Substrate utilization Carbohydrates were considered to represent a major substrate for hydrogen production in this study. The concentration of soluble carbohydrate at the end of the batch digestion tests was affected by both the initial pH and the buffer concentration. Overall, the concentrations of carbohydrate at the end of the digestion decreased with an increase in buffer addition until they reached a constant level under each initial pH condition. The highest removal of carbohydrates (98%) was observed when the initial pH was in the range of 7–8 and the buffer supplementation was 15–20mmol/g VS. The buffer dosage at which the final concentration of carbohydrate reached a plateau decreased with an increase of initial pH. The relationship between carbohydrate concentration and final pH (Fig. 5 ) demonstrated that the consumption of carbohydrates was strongly affected by the final pH. These results indicate that the bacterial activity was suppressed when either the initial pH or the buffer addition was low and the corresponding final pH was low. The results indicate that the addition of buffer to maintain a final pH above 5.0 enhanced conversion of carbohydrates. The conversion of the carbohydrates at high pH’s in the first stage of a two stage digestion process would permit increased loadings on a downstream methanogenic reactor which would be receiving the simpler digestion products."
6,Production of liquid metabolites,"3.4 Production of liquid metabolites The concentrations of VFAs and ethanol were measured at the end of digestion to obtain an insight into the metabolic pathways that were active in the acidogenic reactor as well as to characterize the feedstocks which would be entering a second stage methanogenic digester. Methanol and propanol were also detected in the liquid phase, but their concentrations were less than 10% of the ethanol in all the experiments, hence were not presented in this article. Iso-butyrate, valerate and iso-valerate were not detected in any of the samples. The concentrations of acetic, propionic and butyric acids and ethanol were determined to be substantial and varied with the final pH (Fig. 6). From Fig. 6 it can be observed that, similar to hydrogen production, the production of the VFAs was related to the final pH. The peak production of VFAs occured when the final pH was in the range of 5.5–6.5. Ethanol production was generally independent of the final pH. A substantial increase in ethanol concentration was observed when the final pH was higher than 6.5 which was above the pH range where peak hydrogen production was observed (see Fig. 6 ). The results of this study clearly indicate that the metabolic pathways shifted with the pH of the environment in the batch tests. At low pH values (<4.5) the uptake of carbohydrates was limited and hence the generation of all products was limited. Acetic and butyric acids and ethanol were the primary products under these conditions. The uptake of carbohydrates increased substantially for pH values greater than 4.5 and this resulted in an increase in the generation of all the acids, ethanol and hydrogen. For pH values greater than 6.5 butyric acid production essentially ceased, acetic and propionic acid and hydrogen production was reduced and ethanol production increased. Shifts in metabolic pathways with pH variation can result from changes in the bacterial community (Fang and Liu, 2002) or changes in enzymatic expression (Wilkinson and Rose, 1963). A detailed analysis of the bacterial community composition was beyond the scope of this research. However, stoichiometric and free energy analysis has been used widely for the analysis of acidogenic product accumulation in anaerobic digestion (Smith and McCarty, 1989; Hickey and Switzenbaum, 1991; Ren et al., 1997; and Yu et al., 2004) and can provide a useful tool for the analysis of the dominant pathways. Eqs. (1)–(3) present various pathways of organic acids, ethanol and hydrogen production that have been reported in the literature (Wilkinson and Rose, 1963; Bastone et al., 2002; and Hwang et al., 2004): (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 + 1 / 2 CH 3 COOH + 3 / 4 CH 3 ( CH 2 ) 2 COOH (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 4 / 3 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 / 3 CH 3 COOH + 2 / 3 CO 2 + 2 / 3 H 2 O (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + H 2 O → C 2 H 5 OH + CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 The relative molar concentrations of VFAs, alcohol and hydrogen and possible active pathways at different pH conditions in the current study are shown in Table 2 . The results indicate that more than one pathway was active at all pH conditions. The relatively complex nature of the substrate employed in this study was likely at least partially responsible for this behavior. The ethanol pathway (Eq. (3)) was apparently active at all conditions although its relative activity increased when the pH was either at 7 or below 6. This result was partly consistent with the work done by Ren et al. (1997) and Hwang et al. (2004) who observed ethanol coupled hydrogen production at a pH of 5.0. At pH values between 4.0 and 6.5 it would appear that a pathway similar to that described in Eq. (1) was active as butyric acid was produced under these conditions. There was however minimal hydrogen production when the pH was less than 4.5 therefore some pathway consuming hydrogen could exist in this pH range. For pH values between 6.0 and 7.0 it would appear that additional pathways which resulted in the production of propionic acid were active. The pathway described in Eq. (2) may have been responsible for this behavior. It is interesting to note that hydrogen is not produced in this pathway hence increased contributions from other pathways were required to explain the increased hydrogen production over this pH range. At pH values greater than 6.5 butyric acid production essentially ceased and hence the pathway described in Eq. (1) apparently became inactive. The pathways described in Eqs. (2) and (3) must have been responsible for the production of the liquid products and hydrogen. The distribution of species in the acid phase digester effluent will impact upon the design of the downstream methanogenic digester. Operation of the first stage digester at pH values less than 5 resulted in incomplete conversion of carbohydrates and hence a second stage methanogenic digester would need to provide additional residence time to accommodate the hydrolysis processes that would be required to decompose these complex substrates. Operation of the first stage digester with a final pH of 5.5–6.5 appeared to be optimal in terms of generating high concentrations of simple organic acids and alcohols in the digester effluent. It must however be noted that under these conditions, the concentrations of butyric and propionic acids were substantial (1–1.5g/L). The conversion of these acids to methane requires syntrophic growth of acetogens as well as hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The rate of methane generation in the methanogenic digester will likely be limited by the conversion of these acids. Directly adding phosphate buffer will inevitably increase the cost of hydrogen production. The increased phosphate concentration in the final effluent of the digestion would bring some environmental concern if the effluent was not properly disposed. In practice, alternative cheap buffer sources, such as municipal sewage sludge and the methanogenic digester effluent could be considered. Those materials contain significant amount of alkalinity which could be employed as a pH buffer for hydrogen production (Zhu et al., 2008; Kataoka et al., 2005; Kraemer and Bagley, 2005)."
