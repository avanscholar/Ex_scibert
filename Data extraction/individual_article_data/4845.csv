0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide is considered the cleanest oxidant only with oxygen and water as byproducts·H2O2 has been widely employed in wastewater remediation, water purification, hospital disinfection and chemical oxidation experiments, etc. [1–3]. At present, the industrial H2O2 mainly comes from the traditional anthraquinone method, which must be delivered to use-sites through long-distance transportation and long-term storage [4]. The anthraquinone path exists multiple shortcomings including energy-consuming, environment-unfriendly, high transportation and storage costs, security risks, etc. Therefore, the development of small-scale on-site, safe and energy-saving, efficient and environmentally friendly H2O2 production strategies is imperative, to achieve the purpose of in-situ generation and ready-to-use [5–7]. Currently, photocatalytic H2O2 generation based on semiconductor materials has been verified as an ideal route [8,9], which via ORR (O2 + 2H+ + 2e- → H2O2) or water oxidation reaction (WOR) (2H2O → H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e-). It just meets the above expected requirements. However, the competitive relationship between 2e- reduction to H2O2 and 4e- reduction to H2O from O2 should be paid attention to, which will directly affect the yield and selectivity of H2O2 [10]. For the photocatalytic semiconductors, g-C3N4 [11,12], titanium dioxide (TiO2) [13,14], covalent organic frameworks (COFs) [15], bismuth oxide [16,17] have been certificated as effective catalysts for H2O2 production. Among these, g-C3N4 is the most popular one and is being studied extensively, which is due to its high photocatalytic activity, good visible light response, simple preparation process, low-cost and non-toxic, easy to decorate and modify, etc. Yasuhiro Shiraishi et al. first reported the photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis (125 µmol g-1h−1) using alcohol as hydrogen source and O2 as oxygen source on g-C3N4 catalyst, which was prepared by the calcination of cyanamide precursor [18]. Jae-Hong Kim et al. synthesized g-C3N4 nanosheets using melamine as precursor, where the g-C3N4 was modified by cobalt single atom and anthraquinone to realize the separation of oxidation and reduction active centers, which is very meaningful for the improvement of H2O2 yield (1.2 µmol g-1h−1) [12]. Yongfa Zhu et al. fabricated oxygen-enriched g-C3N4 using dicyandiamide as reactant for H2O2 production (600 µmol g-1h−1), which was more easily to generate 1,4-endoperoxide species for high H2O2 selectivity [19]. In addition, g-C3N4 materials have also been prepared by employing urea, thiourea, mixture of melamine and cyanuric acid etc. as precursors for photocatalytic H2O2 production [20–23]. However, as reported, the H2O2 yields of different g-C3N4 materials vary greatly, which is a subject worth pondering and researching that has not been noticed. The in-depth exploration of this issue will have far-reaching significance for later research. Besides the photocatalytic H2O2 production, the timely activation and consumption of in-situ produced H2O2 to reactive oxygen species (ROS) (e.g., hydroxyl radical •OH), is also an emerging and meaningful research, such as further application in wastewater remediation (e.g., Fenton-like reaction) [24–26], air purification [27], sterilization and disinfection [21,28], etc. Jinhua Ye et al. constructed alkalinized g-C3N4-based photocatalyst as a solid–gas interfacial Fenton reaction via in-situ H2O2 generation and conversion to remove gaseous pollutant [29]. Adrian M.T. Silva et al. realized the in-situ H2O2 generation for the degradation of aromatic compounds on g-C3N4 photocatalyst [30]. Zhaoyong Bian et al. prepared ZnO/g-C3N4 heterojunction to achieve the H2O2 production and in-situ sterilization [21]. Therefore, it is a significant work to explore the photocatalytic in-situ H2O2 production and further consumption processes on g-C3N4 materials via cascade reactions. Herein, a series of different ultra-thin g-C3N4 nanosheets catalysts were synthesized for photocatalytic in-situ H2O2 production to degrade tetracycline in wastewater via a multi-step cascade reaction (Scheme 1 ). The H2O2 generation capabilities of g-C3N4 materials were comprehensively evaluated. The factors that influence on the catalytic performance were analyzed by the chemical and band structures, micromorphology, bare unpaired electrons, average number of electrons transferred (n) in ORR process, coupled with charges separation and transfer ability of different g-C3N4 materials. The tetracycline removal performance of g-C3N4 nanosheets was also assessed by the integrative effect of H2O2 production and decomposition. Among these catalysts, the ultra-thin g-C3N4 nanosheets prepared by dicyandiamide was proved the best one, which exhibited the maximum H2O2 production efficiency (665.4 μmol h−1 g−1) with AQY of 9.3% illuminated at 400 nm. This work has screened a superior g-C3N4 material for photocatalytic H2O2 production, and will provides an effect route to purify water that similar to Fenton-like technique without adding H2O2."

3,Synthesis of g-C3N4 nanosheets,"2.2 Synthesis of g-C3N4 nanosheets The five kinds of g-C3N4 materials were prepared by the thermal polymerization of organic molecules rich in carbon and nitrogen, before the ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets were obtained by the further thermal peeling treatment [31]. Typically, 10 g of precursors were placed in a ceramic crucible with a cover, start calcination at 550 °C (heating rate was 2.3 °C/min) for 4 h in a muffle furnace to prepare bulk g-C3N4. Then, the obtained yellow bulk g-C3N4 were exfoliated to ultrathin nanosheet via a second calcination. In general, 1 g bulk g-C3N4 was laid flat on a 6 cm × 6 cm aluminum foil boat to react at 550 °C (heating rate was 5 °C/min) for 2 h in muffle oven. After all, the light yellow ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets were obtained."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The morphological characterization was carried out on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Hitachi H600).

5,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements Photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky (M−S) plots were carried out on CHI 660E (Chenhua, Shanghai) electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode system, Ag/AgCl and Pt sheet were acted as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. Samples coated on indium tin oxides (ITO) were acted as working electrodes. In general, 6 mg of samples were dispersed in 2 mL of absolute ethanol and ultrasound thoroughly, 600 µL of the suspension were dripped on the ITO glass (1 cm × 3 cm), then the samples were dried under infrared lamp for further the use. During the electrochemical tests, 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.5 M KCl solution with 5.0 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] were used as electrolyte for photocurrent-time (I-T) response and EIS, respectively, 0.2 M Na2SO4 was acted as electrolyte for M−S plots detection. The LSV curves were recorded by RDE (AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N) in an O2-saturated phosphate buffer solution (0.1 M, pH = 7)."
6,Photocatalytic performance evaluation,"2.5 Photocatalytic performance evaluation The photocatalytic performance experiments were manipulated on a multi-channel (9 sites) reaction system (Perfect Light PCX-50C DISCOVER) equipped with a light source of AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2, 400 nm ≤ λ ≤ 760 nm). For photocatalytic H2O2 production, 20 mg of samples were dispersed into the mixture of water (45 mL) and IPA (5 mL). The experiments were started by switching on the light source after stirring in dark for 30 min, while the concentration of produced H2O2 was determined every hour by cerium sulfate titration method [32]. The used catalysts were thoroughly washed by ultra-pure water for the cyclic experiment as the above procedure. For H2O2 decomposition, 20 mg of samples were dispersed in H2O2 solution (1 mM, 50 mL), then the light was switched on after the sample reached to balance in dark. The data was sampled every 15 min to examine the decomposition amount of H2O2. Finally, the in-situ produced H2O2 on g-C3N4 nanosheets were used to degrade pollutants in wastewater via the activation of H2O2 to •OH, which is a cascade Fenton-like reaction. Here using tetracycline as model molecule, 20 mg of samples were dispersed into tetracycline solution (50 ppm), 3 mL of solution was taken out every hour to monitor the concentration of tetracycline by UV spectrophotometer."
7,Results and discussion,
8,"Morphology, structure and composition","3.1 Morphology, structure and composition The ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets were fabricated by the simple thermal polymerization and thermal exfoliation treatments. The g-C3N4 materials were labelled as CCN, DCN, MCN, TCN and UCN according to the different precursors of cyanamide, dicyandiamide, melamine, thiourea and urea, respectively. The flake morphologies of g-C3N4 materials were verified by TEM characterization. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , all samples present ultrathin sheet structures with folds, especially CCN, DCN and MCN are nearly with atomic layer thickness implying more reactive sites, while TCN and UCN with multi-layered structure indicating less reaction sites. Obviously, DCN and MCN exhibit porous structures, which can provide larger specific surface area and more reactive sites for H2O2 conversion. The specific surface area of g-C3N4 materials were further measured by BET ( Fig. S1 ), the bigger values of DCN (68.9 m2 g−1) and MCN (53.6 m2 g−1) were be verified. Moreover, the DCN and MCN display higher flatness with less pleats, along with many needle-shaped structures in their nanosheets (as seen in the red circle areas of their TEM images), exhibit strong rigidity and poor flexibility. Based on the observed phenomenon, we speculate there are many chain heptazine structural units (Fig. 1 g) with numerous end groups and unpaired electrons exist in DCN and MCN [33], while the structures of CCN, TCN and UCN are dominated by planar heptazine units (Fig. 1 h) with fewer unpaired electrons [34]. From the photographs of samples (Fig. 1 f), the color of five different g-C3N4 nanosheets are all light yellow, suggesting their superior sunlight response. XRD technology was applied to examine the crystal structures of as-prepared materials. As shown in Fig. 2 a, two characteristic peaks of all the g-C3N4 materials were detected at 13.1° and 27.3°, respectively. The peak at 13.1° refers to its (100) plane that is attributed to repeating units, another peak belongs to stacking (002) plane. As compared, the (002) peak intensity of DCN is higher than that of other g-C3N4 nanosheets, denoting its better crystallinity and orientation, which is beneficial for the migration of photogenerated electrons (e-). The chemical structure and functional group analysis of g-C3N4 materials were carried out by FT-IR. As displayed in Fig. 2 b, all samples exhibit three signal regions, the first single peak located at 805 cm−1 belongs to the C-H stretch vibration of melem units, the multiple peaks at 1200–1700 cm−1 represent the stretching vibration of the aromatic rings, last region at 2900–3500 cm−1 exist a wide peak that is attributed to the stretching mode of N-H bonds at the end of g-C3N4 structure [35]. The electronic structure distribution of g-C3N4 materials is explored by ESR examination. As shown in Fig. 2 c, there are unpaired electrons in these aromatic systems, which can be confirmed from the peaks of g-factor at about 2.0. The higher ESR peak intensity of DCN implying large amount of free charge carriers exist in its g-C3N4 heterocyclic rings, which is favorable for the photocatalytic reduction reactions. Furtherly, the conclusion that more edged amino-groups, bare unpaired electrons, defects or vacancies are survived in DCN can be inferred [36,37]. The results are consistent well with our above speculation according to the TEM image of DCN, suggesting that there are many chain heptazine units in the structure of DCN. XPS characterization was performed to examine the surface chemical state of synthesized g-C3N4 materials. For the XPS full spectrum of DCN (Fig. 2 d), C and N elements were detected, small amount of O element was also doped because of calcination in air condition. High resolution XPS spectra were also acquired to investigate the binding energies of chemical bonds in g-C3N4 for more detail. For C 1 s (Fig. 2 e), two characteristic peaks situated at 284.8 and 288.3 eV were detected, which belong to the binding energies of Csp2 and N = C-N in g-C3N4, respectively. In the high-resolution spectrum of N 1 s (Fig. 2 f), three states of N element were found, the peaks of 398.7, 400.1 and 401.3 eV are corresponded to the binding energies of C = N-C, N-C3 and N-H in melem units, respectively [38]. The binding energy of O 1 s at 532.4 eV is considered as the adsorbed oxygen on the surface of DCN ( Fig. S2 ). The results are highly consistent with the literature reports. At the same time, the similar XPS results of CCN, MCN, TCN and UCN were also obtained ( Fig. S3-S6 ). However, after careful calculation, the areas and contents of N-C3 and N-H in N 1 s XPS of the five g-C3N4 materials are different. As shown in Table S1, DCN displays the highest N-H peak area ratio (7.52%), coupled with a lower N-C3 peak area percent (17.50%), which further demonstrates that DCN contains more exposed –NH2 groups and unpaired electrons. The results match well with our above speculation that DCN has more chain structures."
9,Optical properties,"3.2 Optical properties The optical properties and charge transfer abilities are important indicators to measure the activity of photocatalysts. UV–Vis DRS, PL and TPV analysis were conducted to assess the sunlight response and photogenerated charge migration ability of the five g-C3N4 nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the visible light absorption edge of DCN, MCN, UCN and TCN are located at about 460 nm, while CCN exhibits a slightly wider visible light range reach to 500 nm. It means that the precursors exhibit slight influence on the visible light response of g-C3N4 materials. Accordingly, the band gaps of CCN, DCN, MCN, TCN and UCN were calculated to be 2.51, 2.69, 2.64, 2.61 and 2.64 eV (Fig. 3 b), respectively, by use of the formula: (ahv)2 = A(hv-Eg ) [32,39]. All these g-C3N4 materials behave good response to sunlight. The rapid recombination of photoinduced electrons (e-) and holes (h+) is one of the main reasons that affect the catalytic performance of materials. Firstly, the PL spectra were used to explore the recombination of photogenerated charges on g-C3N4 materials (Fig. 3 c). Excited by 350 nm single wavelength light, all samples appear an emission peak at 470 nm that caused by the recombination of photogenerated carriers. The PL peak intensities of UCN and DCN are the highest and lowest, represente their maximum and minimum recombination rate of photogenerated carriers, respectively. Furthermore, TPV analysis (Fig. 3 d) was implemented to discuss the dynamic process of photogenerated carriers on different g-C3N4 materials in transient states. Among these, DCN shows the maximum photovoltage intensity and slower decay rate excited by 355 nm laser, demonstrating that DCN exhibits larger carrier density and longer charge lifetime, which is credited to the rapid separation, migration and lower recombination of photoinduced carriers [40,41]. Conversely, UCN exhibits the shortest charge lifetime and utilization. The conclusions drawn from the PL and TPV results are consistent, both infer that DCN may has the greatest photocatalytic potential."
10,Photoelectrochemical properties,"3.3 Photoelectrochemical properties Photogenerated e- is the main force for photocatalytic reduction reactions, especially for the ORR reaction to produce H2O2. Thus, the investigation of photogenerated charges density and utilization of catalysts is crucial. Here, the transient photocurrent response and EIS plots of different g-C3N4 materials were executed to further verify the above contents. The photocurrent response of samples was recording through five cycles under alternate conditions of darkness and light irradiation, every interval was 50 s. As illustrated in Fig. 4 a, the photocurrent densities of different g-C3N4 materials are quite different. The purple curve of UCN exhibits the lowest photocurrent density, while the red line of DCN shows the highest signal, which is 4 times of UCN. The photocurrent densities of DCN, MCN, TCN, CCN and UCN show a decreasing trend. It’s worth noting that the all these g-C3N4 materials exhibit strong light stability, the photocurrent densities almost remain the same after several cycles. The sharp peaks at the moment of turn on light represent the rapid separation of e--h+ pairs and good light response, so as to reach a state of supersaturation and soon reach a balanced state, implying the great charge separation ability of g-C3N4 [39]. The transfer impedance of photoinduced carriers of samples in the photocatalytic process was studied by EIS measurement. The Nyquist plots of samples and equivalent circuit diagram were shown in Fig. 4 b, it can be seen that smaller radius at high frequencies was found on DCN, indicating its smallest charge-transfer resistance and minimal interface resistance, while UCN behaves the largest result. The EIS results are well consistent with the above photocurrent data. These results further demonstrate DCN has better photocatalytic activity than other g-C3N4 materials."
11,Photocatalytic performance,"3.4 Photocatalytic performance The photocatalytic performances of g-C3N4 materials were evaluated by the H2O2 production and tetracycline degradation abilities. The g-C3N4 material is a promising catalyst for H2O2 production via 2e- ORR process (O2 + e- →•O2 –, •O2 – + e- + 2H+ → H2O2). Moreover, the H2O2 yield of g-C3N4 synthesized by different precursors are quite different. As shown in Fig. 5 a-b, the minimum H2O2 output of g-C3N4 is only 30.9 μmol (UCN) after 5 h illumination, and the maximum H2O2 yield arrives to 66.5 μmol (DCN), existing a double gap between the different g-C3N4 materials. The results are sufficient to prove the importance of studying different g-C3N4 precursors for the production of H2O2. The H2O2 production rates with g-C3N4 materials display the following trend: DCN (665.4 μmol h−1 g−1) > MCN (601.9 μmol h−1 g−1) > TCN (485.8 μmol h−1 g−1) > CCN (428.2 μmol h−1 g−1) > UCN (308.6 μmol h−1 g−1). This consequence is coincident well with the above photoelectrochemistry characterization results and our previous speculation. We deduce the defects or vacancies in g-C3N4 materials (Fig. 2 c) may seriously affect their H2O2-evolution performances, because defect and vacancy of semiconductors are demonstrated the gathering places for photogenerated carriers and they are closely related to photocatalytic behaviors. Notably, the H2O2 production rate in the first hour is higher than that of the following process, we speculate it may due to the self-decomposition of produced H2O2 during its generation process. Additionally, the metal free g-C3N4 material exhibits great stability in the photocatalytic ORR process. Taking DCN as example, the H2O2 yields of three cycles were almost unchanged with 66.5, 67.5 and 65.0 μmol yields, respectively (Fig. 5 c). The stability of DCN once again verifies its great potential in large-scale H2O2 production application. Furthermore, the AQY of H2O2 generation at different wavelength of incident light on g-C3N4 is assessed to measure the conversion efficiency of sunlight (Fig. 5 d). The AQY values at 400, 420, 450 and 500 nm are 9.3%, 4.3%, 1.0% and 0.5%, respectively (Table S2). The conversion efficiency of sunlight to H2O2 on DCN is satisfactory, however, there is still a lot of room for improvement, which can be realized by the subsequent modification of g-C3N4 material. The self-decomposition of in-situ produced H2O2 on the surface of catalysts is very pivotal for its further utilization, such as pollutants degradation, sterilization, etc. [21,28,29,42]. Strong oxidizing •OH will be generated via H2O2 decomposition, which is the main component for pollutants removal. As displayed in Fig. 5 e, the H2O2 decomposing abilities on different g-C3N4 materials were explored under one hour illumination after 15 min of adsorption equilibrium in dark. For these g-C3N4 materials, the maximum decomposition amount of H2O2 is nearly 30%, especially DCN exhibits the outstanding H2O2 decomposition ability, which has laid a foundation for the later pollutants degradation. The •OH intermediate products were also verified by the electron spin-resonance spectroscopy technology using 5,5-dimethyl-l-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as the capture reagent, to further verify the activation ability of g-C3N4. As illustrated in Fig. 6 a, the unique characteristic peaks of •OH (1:2:2:1) were obviously discovered on all these g-C3N4 materials. Correspondingly, the •OH peaks intensity of DCN is higher than that of any other g-C3N4 materials, which is due to the rapid H2O2 decomposition of DCN (H2O2 + e- →•OH + OH–). The applicable purpose of H2O2 production and activation is to purify wastewater, here the water purify ability of g-C3N4 materials were assessed using tetracycline (50 mL, 50 ppm) as model. As indicated in Fig. 5 f, the tetracycline removal of different g-C3N4 matches well with their H2O2 production and decomposition behaviors, DCN exhibits the highest pollutant removal ability, nearly 90% of tetracycline can be degraded by the in-situ generated H2O2 after 5 h irradiation."
12,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.5 Photocatalytic mechanism To better explain the above experiment phenomenon and mechanism, the photocatalytic process and average number of electrons of this cascade reaction were explored by ESR and rotating disk electrode (RDE) analysis. Similar to the results of •OH, all g-C3N4 materials exhibit strong superoxide free radicals (•O2 –) signal (six peaks) after irradiation 3 min (Fig. 6 b), which is due to the one e- reduction of O2 (O2 + e- →•O2 –). It can be derived that the conduction bands (CB) of all these g-C3N4 materials are lower than that of •O2 −/O2 (-0.33 V vs NHE) ( Fig. S7 ), the DCN with the highest •O2 – signals behaves the strongest reduction ability. The ESR results are consistent with the photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the CB values and band energy structures of g-C3N4 materials were displayed in Fig. S7 -S8, and all samples exhibit strong 2e- ORR abilities with some subtle difference. The •OH signal is also detected originate from the further decomposition of H2O2 triggered by catalysts under visible light irradiation (H2O2 + e- → •OH + OH–)[43], but the •OH signal strength is relatively weaker than that of •O2 − due to the slower activation of H2O2. The •OH signal strength of DCN is higher than that of other g-C3N4 materials, which due to its containing chain heptazine structural units with abundant e- that is helpful for the pollutants degradation. To investigate the pathway of O2 reduction on g-C3N4, RDE analysis and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were carried out [19,44]. The LSV curves of these g-C3N4 materials (Fig. 6 c and Fig. S9 ) were acquired in the phosphate buffer solution (0.1 M, pH = 7) at different rotating speeds with saturated O2. The Koutecky–Levich plots (Fig. 6 d) were calculated from the LSV data recorded at a potential of −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and the obtained slope of these plots were determined as the n values involved in the ORR reaction. As we can see, the n values of DCN, MCN and CCN are calculated to be 2.27, 2.5 and 2.77, respectively, indicating that these three g-C3N4 materials may facilitate the 2e- transfer pathway of O2 to H2O2. However, the n values of TCN and UCN are 4.32 and 3.82, respectively, which are more likely through the 4e- transfer pathway of O2 to H2O. These results just explain the high H2O2 yield of DCN and the low H2O2 yield of UCN. Thus, the g-C3N4 materials prepared by different precursors have different selectivity for the 2e- ORR process to produce H2O2. The organic pollutants can be quickly degraded by the synergistic oxidation of •O2 –, •OH and photogenerated holes of g-C3N4, this degradation process can proceed smoothly by the in-situ photocatalytic H2O2 generation and activation via a cascade reaction, which is similar to the Fenton-like technique. Based on the above experimental results, the detailed photocatalytic mechanisms of ultrathin g-C3N4 materials are as follows (Fig. 7 ): e--h+ pairs of g-C3N4 will be separated under sunlight irradiation, photogenerated e- be excited to the conduction band (CB) while h+ remains at valence band (VB). The O2 from air can be reduced to H2O2 via 2e- ORR process, which experiences the intermediate of •O2 −, at the same time electron donor IPA was oxidized into acetone by the h+, just as the blue arrows. The produced H2O2 can be further reduced to •OH with oxidizing ability, •OH coupled with •O2 − and h+ can degrade tetracycline organic molecules through oxidation reaction, which is a cascade reaction mechanism."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, a series of ultra-thin g-C3N4 nanosheets catalysts were prepared by using different precursors for photocatalytic in-situ H2O2 production to degrade tetracycline via a multi-step cascade reaction. The micromorphology and structure, optical and photoelectric properties, photogenerated charges separation and migration abilities, H2O2 generation/decomposition and tetracycline removal abilities of these g-C3N4 materials were comprehensively evaluated. As the experimental results show, DCN has illustrated a superior catalyst with the maximum H2O2 production efficiency of 665.4 μmol h−1 g−1, and its AQY value reached to 9.3% illuminated at 400 nm. This work lays strong foundation for H2O2 generation on g-C3N4 material under sunlight irradiation. In addition, we are working on the construction of g-C3N4-based heterojunctions for photocatalytic in-situ H2O2 production and its further applications via cascade reactions."
