0,Introduction,"Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has a broad application due to its properties, such as its low cost, light weight, durability and flexibility [1]. Increasing PET production is raising such a question of its disposal as waste [2]. In the European Union and the UK, it has been stated that plastic wastes constitute 10–13% of municipal solid waste, and 7 wt% (1.7 million tons) of these solid wastes originate from PET [3]. Some solutions such as disposal in landfill [4], through pyrolysis or chemical recovery, have been proposed for recycling PET wastes [5,6]. However, landfills are far from being a complete solution to its disposal because they occupy too much storage area and it is costly [5,7]. The pyrolysis disposal process of PET particularly involves high energy costs, and carbon and toxic gas emissions [8,9]. Chemical recycling of waste PET, on one hand, create benefit from the recovery of certain low molecules, but, on the other hand, it will pave the way for the production of valuable chemicals [10]. The products obtained from its chemical recycling might be monomeric compounds, such as dimethyl terephthalate, bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate or terephthalic acid, which can be used for the production of PET or other synthetic chemicals [11]. The chemicals that can be obtained through the chemical recovery of PET are more preferred than disposal by processes such as pyrolysis, which causes environmental pollution problems from the material [12]. Bis (2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate – also known as dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP) – is an important plasticizer because it is less volatile, has a lower viscosity, and has a higher electrical resistance than other plasticizers. DOTP also does not contain orthophthalate, and it is an important alternative to the carcinogenic plasticizers that do [13,14]. DOTP is used to produce polymer matrices in copolymers, dyes, unsaturated polyesters, polyisocyanurate foams, textile softeners, polyurethane coatings, cementitious materials [8,11,15–19] and also medical devices [20]. Producers have been increasing their annual DOTP production amounts to answer customer demands in recent years [21,22]. For example, in 2017, the BASF group sold 12% more DOTP compared to the same period in the previous year and, based on these sales figures, BASF has decided to increase its DOTP production capacity [23]. Researchers are making serious efforts to obtain a more efficient chemical recycling process. For example, Chen et al. [24] used isooctyl alcohol, with ionic liquid as a solvent, to produce DOTP from PET wastes. They improved the alcoholysis process cost and production yield. Ding et al. [10] studied the alcoholysis kinetics of PET in sub- and supercritical isooctyl alcohol to produce DOTP. They obtained a high yield of DOTP by controlling the supercritical isooctyl alcohol. Torpanyacharn et al. [25] developed methacrylated precursors for the production of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate from PET. Ho et al. [26] enhanced the catalytic glycolysis conditions for the chemical recycling of glycol-modified PET. They improved the reaction rate by three times, under optimum conditions, relative to glycolysis produced with conventional zinc acetate. Zhou et al. [27] synthesized DOTP from the alcoholysis of PET, using 2-ethyl-1-hexanol as the solvent, and choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvents as the catalysts, due to their cheapness and low toxicity. They improved the conversion amount of PET and determined the optimum parameters. Several investigations have been conducted by researchers to develop application areas for DOTP, and to determine the properties of DOTP-doped products due to the above-mentioned features of such materials. Şimşek et al. [28] added DOTP to concrete, reporting that the electrical resistance of the concrete increased with increased amounts of DOTP. They also found that DOTP could be used in building materials due to its high corrosion resistance [5]. Viante et al. [8] developed a new composite, using the bis (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate monomer obtained from the catalyzed glycolysis of PET, to prepare magnetic microspheres, thus presenting a new field for the evaluation of PET wastes. The results of previous studies have proved that the beneficial effects of DOTP on other materials will gradually increase. The ability to design composite films is of great interest [29] because of the increased demand for new and emerging flexible, packaging and medical technologies [30]. Composite films are very attractive [31] for photovoltaics [32], hydrophobic [33] or hydrophilic transparent surface [34], electrodes [35], transistors [36], solar cells [37], lithium ion batteries [38], energy storage [39], textiles products [40], packaging technology [41] and biosensor applications [42] and the production of the diapers or bandages for medical sectors [20]. DOTP can be a suitable material for film production due to its above-mentioned properties. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is one of the preferred film-forming materials because it is non-toxic and non-carcinogenic, and has high thermal stability, high optical permeability, high flexibility and chemical resistance [43–46]. Nanomaterials have been used as filling material in recent years due to their superior mechanical properties [47–49]. Moreover, graphene oxide (GO) [50–55] and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) [56–59] are widely used to provide high tensile strength, elongation at break, thermal stability and electrical conductivity, and they also have antibacterial properties. These materials were selected for this study in order to produce a film matrix with DOTP. The novelties of this study are i) production and characterization of novel PVA/DOTP and PVA/DOTP-composite films incorporated with GO and AgNPs, ii) investigation of the mechanical, hydrophilic, morphological and thermal properties of DOTP-doped composite films by statistical methods, iii) disposal of DOTP obtained by the chemical recycling of PET, which causes serious environmental problems, in composite film production and the revelation of industrial applications for DOTP-doped PVA nanocomposites, using a multidimensional analysis of product properties."
1,Materials and method,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Polyvinyl alcohol (Mw~125,000 and 8.0–98.8 mol% hydrolysis), silver nitrate (≥99.5%), starch (from potato), and hydrogen peroxide (34.5–36.5%) was supplied from Sigma Aldrich. Graphite (<50 μm), potassium permanganate (extra pure), D (+) - Glucose (anhydrous for biochemistry), sodium hydroxide pellets used for pH adjustments (NaOH,> 99%), sulfuric acid (95–97%), ortho phosphoric acid (85%) was obtained from Merck Millipore. An improved Hummers' method was preferred as a green solution in order to synthesis GO [60,61]. A green method [62], using glucose as a reducing agent and starch solution from potatoes as a capping agent, was selected to synthesize AgNPs [63]. DOTP was procured from the Meltem Kimya Company [28]. Detail information about synthesis and characterization of GO, AgNPs and DOTP can be seen in the supplementary material appendix A."
3,Method,"2.2 Method The Taguchi method is an experimental design method based on the principle of minimizing the duration of the experiment and reducing the cost of the test using orthogonal arrays [64,65]. This method is widely used to improve the product quality, with the decreasing process variance and accelerate the product development activities [66]. The optimization design based on the Taguchi method aims to determine an optimum quality factor which has a great impact on the quality characteristics of the product. In Taguchi method, Signal/Noise (S/N) ratios are used to evaluate the product quality. These S/N ratios are classified in three ways as the lower is better, the nominal is better and the higher is better, depending on their characteristics [60,61,64,65]. However, it is not possible to use Taguchi Method for simultaneous optimization of multiple quality criteria. In order to make it possible to do a multiple-response optimization using Taguchi Method, in this study, Taguchi Method is combined with TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) Method. The advantage of the TOPSIS-based Taguchi method is that it involves simpler calculations compared to the other complex multi-response optimization methods. In Taguchi method, “the highest is the best” signal to noise ratios (S/N) ratios and “the lowest is the best” S/N ratios are calculated for each criterion. Responses converted to S/N ratios are referred to the “decision matrix”. The weighted decision matrix is calculated by weighting the responses. Details of the method are given in Şimşek et al. [60,61,64,65]. The proposed methodology for the production and characterization of the novel PVA/DOTP and PVA/DOTP Composite Films Incorporated with the GO and AgNPs are shown in Fig. 1 ."
4,Experimental design,"The hardness and elastic modulus of the PVA/DOTP composite films incorporated with GO and AgNPs were selected as the two quality criteria (responses) to indicate the mechanical properties. A Berkovich-type indenter, with a 0.1–400 mN nanoindentation load range, was used to measure these features [67–70]. In order to avoid the effect of the substrate on a film's mechanical properties, the maximum depth of indentation was fixed at 200 nm, which was less than one-tenth to one-seventh of the total thickness [69]. The load and unload times were both 10 s, and the displacement speed of the indenter was 20 nm/s. The same test was repeated six times on each sample. The hardness and elastic modulus of the composite films should be at a maximum for the production of durable and flexible thin films. The third quality criterion (response) selected was the contact angle, which indicates the hydrophilic properties composite film. The quality criteria and determined weights for the PVA/DOTP composite films incorporated with GO and AgNPs are summarized in supplementary material appendix B, Table B1. Four three-level factors, having major effects on the properties of PVA/DOTP composite films incorporated with GO and AgNPs were selected to build an experimental design matrix. The definitions, symbols and levels of the factors are shown in supplementary materialappendix B, Table B2. An Attension theta-type tensiometer was used to measure the contact angles of the composite film samples. The contact angle of PVA/DOTP composite films must be minimized to produce thin films with hydrophilic surfaces that can be used as, for example, solar cells, periscopes and lenses, and other biological and environmental applications [71,72]. The other quality criteria selected were specific heat capacity (thermal energy storage capability) and weight loss (thermal stability). The specific heat capacity of composite films should be maximized to improve their energy storage capabilities [73] while the weight loss of composite films should be minimized to enhance their thermo stability properties [74]. The specific heat capacity and weight loss values of the composite films were determined using TA Instruments Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) Q200 and Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) Q500 devices. Solution casting method was used to produce DOTP/PVA (DP), DOTP/PVA/GO (DPG) and DOTP/PVA/AgNPs (DPA) composite films. Detail information about synthesis process and quality criteria of produced composite films can be seen in the supplementary material appendix B. L 9 (34) orthogonal array was selected for carrying out the experiments. Experimental design including the details of the mixture design is given in Table 1 . The thickness and carbon to oxygen atomic ratios (C/O) of the PVA/DOTP composite films incorporated with the GO and AgNPs can be seen in Table 1. The results of the conducted experiments for PVA/DOTP composite films incorporated with the GO and AgNPs (data set) are also given in supplementary material Appendix C, Table C1."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of PVA-DOTP composite films incorporated with nanomaterials,"4.1 Characterization of PVA-DOTP composite films incorporated with nanomaterials FTIR analysis: Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to characterize the synthesized PVA-DOTP composite films incorporated with GO and AgNPs. The FTIR spectra of the PVA control film and PVA-DOTP films were recorded to compare the chemical changes in the film matrices of the DP composite films; the spectra are shown in Fig. 2 A. High-intensity peaks were centered at 415-600 cm−1, 728 cm−1, 829 cm−1 and 850 cm−1 (symbolized as 1–5), which are related to a C–H-bending benzene derivative, C–H-bending benzene 1, 4-disubstituted and C–O vinyl ether stretch, referring to the DOTP structure. As expected, peak intensity at 1020 cm−1 (symbolized as 6) was decreased in the composite films incorporating GO and Ag0. Strong peaks at 1100 cm−1, 1247 cm−1 and 1327 cm−1 (symbolized as 7, 8 and 9) are associated with C–O stretching alcohol or aromatic ester, which appeared strongly in the PVA, DOTP and GO spectra, and were clearly seen in all the composite films (Fig. 2B and C). CH3 methyl stretching and CC aromatic stretching (symbolized as 9′) were robustly present in the spectra of the DOTP and GO (Table 2 ). For this reason, this was a very strong peak in the DP composite films and a strong peak in the DPG composite films; while it was almost absent from the DPA composites. The peaks at 1380 cm−1 and 1410 cm−1 (symbolized as 9’ and 10), attributed to methylene (–CH2–) bending, and the hydroxyl group were clearly seen in all the composite films, as expected. As the amount of DOTP increased in the PVA matrix, and mixing time such as DP8 and DP9, the intensity of the peak at 1720 cm−1, related to CO stretching (symbolized as 11), was considerably reduced (Fig. 2A). Apparent absorption bands at 2900 cm−1 and 3260 cm−1 are related to C–H stretching and hydroxyl groups belonging to DOTP, PVA, GO and Ag0 were seen in the all composite films (symbolized as 12 and 13). Moreover, no new peaks were observed in the spectra of the composite films, proving that no other chemical interactions occurred between the materials. Raman analysis: The Raman shift positions of three weak spectral peaks at 1000 cm−1 (symbolized as 1), observed in all composite films, belong to the PVA (Fig. 3 A–C) [83]. A strong band at 1350 cm−1 was clearly seen in the DPG composite films, as expected (symbolized as 2; Fig. 3B). Owing to the in-phase CH3 methyl and CH2 methylenes stretching of the DP composite films, a strong Raman peak appeared at around 1460 cm−1 (symbolized as 3). This peak also appeared at around 1460 cm−1 in the DPA composite films (Fig. 3A). The peak at around 1460 cm−1 seems to have shifted to 1590 cm−1 in the films containing GO, or perhaps the GO peak at 1590 cm−1 (peak G) prevented this peak from appearing (symbolized as 3’; Fig. 3B). The weak band in the light green areas indicates CC vibration in the DPA composite films, resulting from the AgNPs (symbolized as 4; Fig. 3C). With the amount of DOTP in the PVA matrix and the mixing time at medium values (e.g. DP8 and DP9), the intensity of the peak at 1850 cm−1 related to CO stretching (symbolized as 5) was reduced considerably (Fig. 3A). This peak was almost completely lost in the DPG composite films (Fig. 3B). The basic chemical structure of the DOTP is the benzene ring, which contains a CC bond at 2350 cm−1 (symbolized as 6), as seen in the Raman spectra of all the composite films. The intensity of the peak at 2350 cm−1 was decreased substantially in the DPG composite films (Fig. 3B), with the increase in C–O and C–H stretching as a result of the PVA/GO and DO/DOTP interactions. Also, a relatively weak peak occurred in the 2850 cm−1–2930 cm−1 (symbolized as 7) orange region due to the in-plane rocking of CH3 groups attached to the benzene chain, and C–H vibration (Fig. 3A–C). These results demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy is a very useful tool for characterizing PVA/DOTP composite films incorporated with nanomaterials such as GO and AgNPs. Table 3 shows the Raman spectra for the materials used to manufacture the composite films."
7,Mechanical properties,"4.2 Mechanical properties Fig. 4 A–C shows the variation in hardness with the change in factor level and film thickness. The hardness of the DP composite films reaches the highest value using a moderate PVA and DOTP level, with an 86.80 μm average thickness (DP5; Fig. 4A). Whilst the hardness of the DP composite films increased with increasing PVA and DOTP, it decreased dramatically when the usage of DOTP and PVA exceeded 0.075 g and 1.2 g, respectively. Above this point, the amount of PVA and DOTP was increased by decreasing the mixing time. Therefore, it can be said that adequate mixing was not achieved, and the sample had lost its homogeneity. Moreover, the thicknesses of the DP composite films contained high amounts of PVA and DOTP were almost twice as much as the DP films with moderate amounts of PVA and DOTP. It can be seen from the main effects of the analyzed responses (Fig. 4B), plotted using experimental design analysis, that the hardness of the DP composite films increased as the mixing time increased. The main effect of the DP composite films confirmed that film hardness increased with moderate DOTP and PVA usage, and decreased with high PVA and DOTP (Fig. 4B). The hardness of the DPG composite films decreased dramatically with the increasing GO amount significantly (Fig. 4C and D and ). Even though the amount of nanomaterial used in thin films can be increased using the given methods, the generally accepted opinion is that nanoparticles tend to agglomerate in the presence of aqueous media due to the strong van der Waals forces [88]. Furthermore, the interaction effect between molecules, such as H bonds, which can be seen in Fig. 4B, and van der Waals forces has caused GO flake dispersion in the PVA matrix to become difficult. Increasing the mixing time did not prevent the agglomeration in the DPG composite films (Fig. 4D). The hardness of the DPA composite films reached its peak with the use of moderate PVA and low DOTP amounts, and with a 7.6 μm average thickness (DPA7; Fig. 4E). It is noteworthy that a high hardness value was obtained at this thickness. It was observed that, as the glucose to AgNO3 ratio increased (in other words, the particle size of the AgNPs decreased), the hardness of the DPA films increased. This is because nanoparticles with a smaller particle size form a more homogeneous and non-aggregating PVA-based mixture matrix (Fig. 4F). A more successful hardness performance was achieved with low amounts of DOTP and 2.25% (w/w) PVA (Fig. 4F). One of the most striking results was the elastic modulus of the DP composite films. The DP5 composite film, with an 86.8 μm thickness, and the DP9 composite film, with a 161.4 μm thickness, had 6.14 and 13.41 times higher elastic modulus, respectively, than the reference PVA film, with a 98.4 μm thickness (Fig. 5 A). The elastic modulus of the DP composite films increased with increasing amounts of PVA and DOTP (Fig. 5B). Low stirring times and amounts of sample produced composites with higher elastic modulus (Fig. 5B). The elastic modulus of the DPG1 composite films, with 1% GO (w/w) and 2.25% DOTP (w/w for PVA film), with a 63 μm thickness, achieved a 6.19 times higher elastic modulus than the reference PVA film, with a 121 μm thickness (Fig. 5C). Above this point, it decreased dramatically (Fig. 5D) due to agglomeration, similarly to the hardness results. Increasing the mixing time did not affect in the DPG composite films’ elastic modulus values (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, DOTP enhanced the elastic modulus of the composite film when used only in a PVA matrix. However, when DOTP was used with GO in a PVA matrix, it decreased the elastic modulus of the composite film due to the agglomeration problem of the nanomaterial. The DP composite film modified with AgNPs with the highest elastic modulus was DPA7, with a 7.6 μm thickness (Fig. 5E). It is also noteworthy that a high elastic modulus was obtained at this thickness, similarly to the hardness test results. The main result that can be deduced from the effect plot is that, as the glucose: AgNO3 ratio increases (in other words the particle size of the AgNPs decreases), the elastic modulus values of the composite films increases (Fig. 5F) due to low agglomeration. It is evident that nanomaterials used in large amounts overshadow the positive effects of DOTP on hardness and elasticity. The mechanical test results showed that a long mixing time provided more successful homogenization of the composite films. Moreover, the disadvantage of the films synthesized at this point is the loss of homogeneity due to the addition of nanomaterials. However; this problem did not occur with small size silver nanoparticles, but graphene oxide which tended to agglomerate caused the homogeneity problem. The capping agent (soluble starch from potato) used in silver nanoparticle synthesis prevented agglomeration and thus a more homogeneous DPA film was obtained. Homogeneity problem in DPG composite films can be overcome by the use of surfactants during the addition of graphene oxide into the PVA matrix."
8,Hydrophilic properties,"4.3 Hydrophilic properties A 3 μl of distilled water droplet was deposited onto the surface of the composite films. Measurements were taken as the droplet receded, including the contact angle within 5 s [89]. The measured contact angles are presented as a function of the variation in factor level of the composite films. The average contact angle values of six repetitions of PVA-DOPT composite films incorporating nanomaterials were calculated. Composite films DP6, with an 226 μm thickness, DP3, with a 199.4 μm thickness, and DP5, with a 86.8 μm thickness, achieved a 2.73, 2.67 and 2.27 times lower contact angle, respectively, than the reference PVA film, with a 98.4 μm thickness (Fig. 6 A). Another result was that the contact angle of the DP composite films decreased as the carbon: oxygen atomic ratio increased (Fig. 6A and 3.55 for DP3 and 3.89 for DP6). The main effect plot of the contact angle for the DP composite films clearly shows that their contact angles decreased with increasing DOTP (Fig. 6B, D and 6F). The contact angle for DPG5 which had the lowest value decreased from 49.07° to 42.04° (Fig. 6C). DPA6, which had a high carbon: oxygen atomic ratio of 3.3, with a 194.2 μm thickness, had a 1.73 times lower contact angle than the reference PVA film, with a 98.4 μm thickness (Fig. 6E). The amount of PVA and the stirring time should be kept at moderate levels (Fig. 6B, D and 6F). The contact angles of the composite films decreased when the glucose: AgNO3 ratio increased (in other words, the particle size of the AgNPs decreased; Fig. 6F). Images of the water droplets placed on the composite films, such as DP3, DG5 and DPA6, are included in Fig. 6G. At this point, the application of mixing more or less than necessary, adversely affects the contact angle property of the films. This disadvantage can be eliminated by optimization study."
9,Thermal properties,"4.4 Thermal properties It is necessary to know the thermal properties of materials, such as their specific heat capacity and weight loss, in order to understand their thermal behavior. Fig. 7 illustrates the specific heat profiles, at constant pressure, as a function of the factor levels of the DP composite films investigated. The specific heat values measured between −60 °C and 60 °C. The composite films with the highest specific heat capacities were determined as DP1, DPG8 and DPA4. However, the specific heat capacity values of the DP composite films incorporating GO and AgNPs remained at the same level as that of the reference PVA. Based on the main effect plots, it can be interpreted that the specific heat capacity of DP composite films decreased with increasing amounts of DOTP (Fig. 7A–F). DOTP, with its low specific capacity based composite films has an inability to store the thermal energy. However, the fact that it causes high specific heat brings thermal stability to the films that can hold a large of thermal energy, while it has the disadvantage that the films need more energy to increase their temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis was used to determine and investigate the thermal behavior of synthesized DP composite films upon heating under a nitrogen atmosphere. Composite film samples of 6 mg weight were submitted to a heating rate of 10 °C/min using aluminum crucibles and a range of temperature from 25 °C to 600 °C. Fig. 8 illustrates weight loss as a function of factor level of the DP composite films. The films started to decompose around 120–200 °C. The weight loss of the films was continuous up to 200–500 °C, and maximum decomposition was reached at about 600 °C. The percentage of weight loss and the temperature at the peak degradation for all the synthesized composite films are shown in Fig. 8. A sample for calculation of the maximum weight loss and temperature at maximum weight loss can be seen in the Supplementary Material-Appendix D-Figure D1. The first stage, below 200 °C, the weight loss was associated with the loss of water [90]. The second stage, at between 200 °C and 500 °C, the weight loss was due to the decomposition of chain segments of the PVA molecules and hydrogen bonding [91]. The difference in the final residues at temperature exceeding 500 °C for the DP composites corresponds to the inorganic fraction. The DP composite film with the lowest percentage weight loss was determined as DP9, with a 161.4 μm thickness, at a maximum decomposition temperature of 510 °C (Fig. 8A). The percentage weight loss of the DP composite films decreased with increasing amounts of PVA and DOTP (Fig. 8B). DPG4 had the lowest percentage weight loss, with a 113 μm thickness, at a maximum decomposition temperature of 487.5 °C (Fig. 8C). Based on the main effect plots, the interaction of the DOTP and PVA negatively affected the thermal stability of the DPG composite films (Fig. 8D). The reasons for this may be the strong hydrogen bonding between PVA and GO [91], and also interaction between the methyl groups in DOTP and the carboxylate or hydroxyl groups in GO. The highest thermal stability in all of the synthesized composite films was determined in DPA6, with a 40.06% weight loss (Fig. 8E). A weight loss between 472 °C and 600 °C did not occurred in DPA6. The weight loss in DPA was significantly reduced by the synergetic impact of the amount of DOTP (Fig. 8F). The minimum weight loss value was achieved from short stirring times (Fig. 8B and D), except in the DPA composite films (Fig. 8F)."
10,Optimum design,"4.5 Optimum design The experimental design and the S/N ratios for the-lower-the-better and the-higher-the-better responses were calculated, respectively, for each response, and the results are given in Table 4 (Columns 2–6). The deviation values from the positive (Si*) and from negative ideal solutions were calculated (Table 4, Columns 7, 8). The deputy responses (Ci*) are also shown in Table 4 (final columns). Three deputy responses, symbolized by Ci1, Ci2 and Ci3, were determined for the DP composite films, considering the same weight assignment, hydrophilic composite film production and thermal stable composite film production, respectively. The same optimum design (maximum deputy Ci4 and Ci5) was achieved for the DPG and DPA values, even when different weights were assigned to the criteria. Normalization methods led to the optimum parameter design of DP5 and DP9 for the DP composite films, DPG9 for DPG for the DP composite films modified with the GO and DPA7 for DPA for the composite films modified with the AgNPs (Table 5 ). Improvement or deterioration ratios for the properties of the DP composite films with different weights were calculated, and are given in Table 5."
11,Comparison with the PVA/GO and PVA/AgNPs composite films,"4.6 Comparison with the PVA/GO and PVA/AgNPs composite films In order to analyze the effectiveness of DOTP additives, DP composite films modified with nanoparticles were compared to the widely used PVA/GO and PVA/AgNPs composite films, in terms of mechanical, hydrophilic and thermal performance. The greatest hardness, and highest contact angle and percentage weight loss values were found to be 381.17 MPa, 62.5° and 99% for 1% (w/w) GO-reinforced PVA composite. The hardness of DP9 was found to be 335.2% higher (1658.93 MPa), whilst the contact angle and weight loss of DP5 was found to be 63.71% and 51.43% lower, than the PVA/GO film. The elastic modulus were determined as 0.774 GPa and 1.087 GPa for the PVA composite with 1% (w/w) GO and AgNPs, respectively. DP5, with an 86.8 μm thickness, had 50.08 and 35.65 times higher elastic modulus (38.76 GPa) than the PVA/GO, with an 83.0 μm thickness, and the PVA/Ag, with a 90.0 μm thickness, respectively. The DOTP-added composites were successful in all other criteria, such as mechanical, hydrophilic and thermal performance, but not in specific heat value (Fig. 9 )."
12,Conclusions,"In this study; for the first time, DOTP-added PVA composite films were produced, characterized and the quality characteristics of their properties were optimized. The DOTP-PVA composites were also modified with nanomaterials, such as GO and AgNPs, and these were compared with widely used PVA/GO and PVA/AgNPs composite films. The DP composite films and DP composite films modified with nanomaterials were characterized using FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. DOTP, as organic filler, increased the hardness, elastic modulus and thermal stability of the PVA films, whilst the contact angle was reduced. By combining the TOPSIS and Taguchi methods in this study, DP composite films and DP composite films modified with nanomaterials were investigated through a multidimensional perspective and an application-based optimization methodology. By using TOPSIS-based Taguchi optimization, simultaneous improvements in the hardness (105.49%), elastic modulus (641.43%) and contact angle (53.78%) were achieved for DP9. On the other hand, this caused a lower weight loss, which can be improved by 15.91% by increasing the DOTP content for applications such as swabs, hydrophilic membranes and protecting packaging materials. DOTP with orthophthalate-free and non-carcinogenic properties must be used in these sectors. Thus, the solid waste disposal of PET can be provided effectively. A small amount of GO (using 1% w/w instead of PVA) improved the composite films’ properties, including their energy storage capabilities. However, GO above 1% by mass of PVA produced a more porous structure, with a possible tendency to agglomeration, thus losing its positive effect on the composite films and showing a tendency to worsen their properties. Smaller AgNPs led to greater hardness, elastic modulus and a lower contact angle. The results show that the modification of smaller AgNPs with PVA is effective, in terms of both mechanical and hydrophilic properties. When the results of the study are evaluated, especially the textile and construction sectors seem more attractive for synthesized films. Synthesized films have a great potential to be used as, production of disposable underpad, industrial swabs and texturized yarns in the textile industry and synthetic fiber as reinforcement material in the construction industry because of its a high modulus of elasticity, hardness, hydrophilicity and thermal stability properties."
