0,Introduction,"Quinolines represent an important class of nitrogen-containing heterocycles which were frequently found in the alkaloid family [1]. They exhibited also a wide range of biological properties and were utilized as ligands of transition metal catalysts and organocatalysts [2,3], and building blocks of functional materials [4]. For this reason, a series of classical synthetic methods, such as Skraup, Doebner-von Miller, Conrad-Limpach, Pfitzinger and Friedlaeder synthesises, have been developed in past decades [5]. Among them, Friedlaeder synthesises, e.g. acid or base-mediated coupling of o-aminobenzaldehydes with ketones, are considered to be one of the most straightforward methods to access quinolines although o-aminobenzaldehydes are very unstable materials and prone to self-condensation [6]. In recent years, transition metal-catalyzed oxidative cyclization of o-aminobenzyl alcohols with ketones as a modified Friedlaeder synthesises have been reported [7]. However, these procedures required extra addition of large excess of ketones, unsaturated olefines or molecular oxygen as sacrificial hydrogen acceptors to generate in situ o-aminobenzaldehydes from o-aminobenzyl alcohols. More recently, much attention has been paid to the development of transition metal-catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenative reactions with the liberation of hydrogen gas [8]. Such methodologies provide the clearest and most atom-economical processes as alternatives to traditional oxidation reactions. Several groups have reported acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of o-aminobenzyl alcohols with ketones to quinolines catalyzed by iridium [9], ruthenium [10], nickel [11], manganese [12] and rhenium complexes [13]. However, all these procedures required the presence of large amount of inorganic strong base (KOH, tBuOK), and thus the potential of practical application is still highly restricted. Fujita and co-workers have developed a series of Cp*Ir complexes bearing a bipyridine or a bipyridonate ligand, which exhibited high activities for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols and N-heterocycles [14], and hydrogen production from an alcohol-water solution under basic conditions based on the concept of ligand-promoted dehydrogenation [15]. We have also demonstrated that such Cp*Ir complexes are highly effective metal–ligand bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen auto-transfer process [16], acceptorless dehydrogenative cyclization [17], and transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones [18]. As part of a continuing interest in the field, we turned our attention from iridium complexes to ruthenium ones because ruthenium is much cheaper than iridium [19]. Herein, we with to describe the design and synthesis, of a ruthenium complex bearing a 2,2′-bibenzimidazole ligand that contains a tautomerism structure and protic hydrogens like α-hydroxypyridine (Scheme 1 ). Furthermore, this complex was found to be a general and highly efficient catalyst for the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of o-aminobenzyl alcohols with ketones to quinolines in the presence of carbonate."
1,Result and discussion,"The synthetic procedure to prepare the designed ruthenium complex [(p-cymene)Ru(BiBzImH2)Cl][Cl] was outlined in Scheme 2 . The reaction of [(p-cymene)RuCl2]2 with 2,2′- bibenzimidazole (2.2 equiv) was performed in THF at 60 °C for 12 h. The formed yellow solid was collected by filtration and then washed with THF. The complex is stable to air and moisture both in the solid state and in solution. The crystal for X-ray crystallography was obtained and its molecular structure was shown in Fig. 1 with pertinent bond lengths and angles. 2,2′-Bibenzimidazole ligand is bonded to ruthenium center with two nitrogen atoms with a bond angle of 76.60 (19) in a chelating fashion. Bond lengths of N1-Ru and N3-Ru are 2.118 (5) Å and 2.135 (5) Å, respectively. With the synthesized [(p-cymene)Ru(BiBzImH2)Cl][Cl] (cat. 1) in hand, we investigated its catalytic activity for the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of o-aminobenzyl alcohol (1a) with acetophenone (2a). In the presence of cat. 1 (1 mol %) and Cs2CO3 (0.5 equiv), the reaction was carried out at 125 °C for 12 h to afford the product 3aa in 92% yield (Table 1 , entry 1). Using its analog [(p-cymene)Ru(BiBzImMe2)Cl][Cl] (cat. 2) as an alternative catalyst, the product 3aa was obtained in only 16% yield (Table 1, entry 2). In the case of ruthenium complexes bearing a functional α-hydroxypyridine ligand [(p-cymene)Ru (6,6′-(OH)2bpy)(H2O)][OTf]2 (cat. 3) and its analog [(p-cymene) (6,6′-(OMe)2bpy)(H2O)][OTf]2 (cat. 4), product 3aa was obtained in 89% and 19% yields, respectively (Table 1, entries 3–4). Obviously, NH or OH units in the ligand are crucially important for the catalytic activity of ruthenium complexes. When other ruthenium complexes (cat. 5–11) were examined, reactions afforded the product 3aa in 14–41% yields (Table 1, entries 5–11). Then, cat. 1 was chosen as a catalyst for further investigation. Tries to use of K2CO3 or Na2CO3 as an alternative base, to reduce the amount of Cs2CO3, and to decrease reaction temperature resulted in relatively low yields (Table 1, entries 12–15). Having established the optimal conditions (Table 1, entry 1), the scope of reaction with respect to ketones was conducted and these results are outlined in Table 2 . Transformations of acetophenones bearing an electron-rich substituent gave the corresponding products 3ab-3ah in 76–84% yields. Acetophenones bearing one or two halogen atoms were also readily cyclized to desired products 3ai-3ao in 77–85% yields. Furthermore, this system was applied to substrates bearing more serious electron-deficient substituents, such as trifluoromethyl and trifluoromethoxy groups, affording corresponding products 3ap and 3aq in 80% and 84% yields, respectively. Readilyreducible or labile substituents, such as nitro and cyano groups, were well tolerated, reactions afforded desired products 3ar and 3as in 82% and 85% yields, respectively. When 1-(4-phenylphenyl)ethanone and 1-(pyrazin-2-yl)ethanone were used, corresponding products 3at and 3au were made in 80% and 76% yields, respectively. Non-methyl ketones, such as propiophenone, n-butyrophenone and 1-tetralone could be converted to corresponding quinolines 3av-3ax in 77–82% yields. For aliphatic ketones, such as 1-cyclopropylethanone and 3,3-dimethylbutan-2-one, desired products 3ay and 3az were successfully isolated in 86% and 83% yields, respectively. To expand further generality of reaction, the couplings with respect to o-aminobenzyl alcohols were investigated (Table 3 ). Transformations of o-aminobenzyl alcohols bearing an electron-rich substituent gave corresponding products 3ba and 3ca in 84% and 87% yields, respectively. Similarly, desired products 3da-3ga were obtained in 81–85% yields when o-aminobenzyl alcohols bearing an electron-efficient substituent were utilized as substrates. Based experimental results, two possible simultaneous mechanisms for the present synthesis of quinolines via acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of o-aminobenzyl alcohols with ketones were presented (Scheme 3 ). The initial step of reaction involved the formation of species A via the reaction of cat. 1 with Cs2CO3. With the process of the activation of alcohols, the ligand accepted a proton to give alkoxy ruthenium species B, which further underwent ß-hydrogen elimination to give aldehydes and ruthenium hydride species C. In mechanism I, the ligand-promoted simultaneous hydrogen transfer from the hydride on the ruthenium and the proton on the ligand resulted in the regeneration of catalytic species A and the liberation of a molecular hydrogen. Furthermore, a base-promoted cross-aldol condensation between ketones and resulting o-aminobenzaldehydes afforded α,ß-unsaturated ketones, followed by an intramolecular cyclodehydration occurred to give quinolines. In mechanism II, after a base-promoted cross-adol condensation between ketones and resulting aldehydes, the hydride on the ruthenium and proton on the ligand of species C were simultaneously transferred to the CC bond of α,ß-unsaturated ketones, resulted in the regeneration of catalytic species A and the liberation of α-alkylated ketones, which underwent sequential intramolecular cyclodehydration/dehydrogenation to afford corresponding quinolines. To support the proposed mechanism for acceptorless dehydrogenation, the liberation of gas in the process of model reaction was collected through a water displacement (Table 1, entry 1). This gas was determined to molecular hydrogen by GC analysis and was calculated to be 87% yield (299.15 K, 100,300 Pa, 21.6 mL). As outlined in Scheme 4 , the gram-scale synthesis of a biologically active molecule (Na+ channel antagonists) was represented in order to demonstrate the application of this catalytic system. Under standard conditions, the coupling of 1a (25 mmol) and 2a (30 mmol, 1.2 equiv) gave the product 3aa in 85% yield. Subsequently, the reduction of 3aa was carried out in the presence of NaBH3CN (2 equiv) to afford the product 4 in 71% yield, which are further reacted with NH2CN (7 equiv) to give the desired product 5 in 30% yield according to the previous report [20]."
2,Conclusions,"In summary, we demonstrated the design and synthesis of a ruthenium complex bearing a functional 2,2′-bibenzimidazole ligand and developed it as the first catalyst for acceptorless dehydrogeantive coupling of o-aminobenzyl alcohols with ketones to quinolines in the presence of carbonate salt. Under environmentally benign conditions, a series of desirable products were obtained in high yields. It was confirmed that NH units in the ligand are crucial for catalytic activity. The application of this catalytic system for the scale-gram synthesis of biologically active molecular was also undertaken. Notably, this research exhibits new potential of metal–ligand bifuctional catalysts for acceptorless dehydrogenative reactions."

8,Procedure for the hydrogen evolution experiment [44],"4.5 Procedure for the hydrogen evolution experiment [44] 1a (1 mmol, 123 mg), 2a (145 mg, 1.2 mmol, 1.2 equiv), cat. 1 (6 mg, 0.01 mmol, 1 mol %), Cs2CO3 (165 mg, 0.5 mmol, 0.5 equiv) and tert-amyl alcohol (1 mL) were added to a 5 mL thick walled glass vessel with a condenser tube, which was previously degassed three times and placed under a N2 atmosphere. The vessel was connected to the gas collection apparatus (standard water displacement apparatus, using a graduated cylinder to determine volume), and the entire system was flushed with N2 for 5 min and allowed to equilibrate for 5 min. The reaction was stirred vigorously at 125 °C for 12 h. The presence of hydrogen in the collected gas was confirmed by GC analysis. The GC analysis was performed on a gas chromatograph with TCD detector. Injector temperature = 150 °C, column temprature = 80 °C, detector temperature (TCD) = 80 °C, carrier gas = N2, t = 0.558 min. The volume of 1 mol of H2 at 299.15 K, 100,300 Pa was calculated according to the van der Waals equation as shown below (p + n 2 a V 2 )(V-nb) = nRTwhere R = 8.3145 m3 ·Pa·mol−1·K−1; T = 299.15 K; p = 100 300 Pa; a = 0.02476 Pa·m6·mol−2; b = 0.02661 × 10−3 m3·mol−1; thus, V (H2, 299.15 K, 100 300 Pa) = 24.8 L·mol−1. The collected volume of gas in this experiment above was 21.6 mL, which corresponds to 0.87 mmol of H2."
