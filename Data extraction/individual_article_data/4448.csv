0,Introduction,"Depletion of natural oil, coal and natural gas reserves and the search for fuels with reduced environmental impact has driven interest in biodiesel production. Biodiesel is currently one of the main alternatives for fossil fuels since it is renewable, biodegradable and can be used directly in diesel engines. Over several years, both industry and academia have produced improvements to the biodiesel process that seek to lower the cost of feedstock growth or that try to identify optimal reaction conditions that would reduce energy requirements [3,4]. Biodiesel is composed of fatty acid esters generated via methanolysis or ethanolysis of triglycerides. Because methanol and triglycerides are generally not miscible, the initial phase behavior of the reactants strongly affects the rate of conversion of the process. The reaction usually involves high temperature, pressure, and alcohol-to-oil ratio to promote the miscibility of the reactants, as well as high mixing to enhance transport between the immiscible phases [5–7]. Csernica et al. showed that the phase behavior plays a critical role in the rate of production of biodiesel. Not surprisingly, they noted that the reaction proceeds slowly when the concentration of triglycerides (TG) in the reactive phase is low and increases dramatically when this concentration increases [8]. Different methods have been proposed to improve biodiesel yields and lower the reaction times, and many of these, attempt to alter the phase equilibria of the initial reactants. These include tuning the initial reactants to be more soluble [9,10], supercritical transesterification [11–14], or use of co-solvents of different types in order to promote mixing [13,15–17]. Carbon dioxide exhibits many desirable features for use as a cosolvent for biodiesel transesterification. CO2 is naturally abundant, it exhibits mild critical parameters (31.1 °C and 7.39 MPa), it is easy to separate from products and excess reactants, and it enhances miscibility of low molecular weight alcohols and triglycerides [18,19]. Soh et al. demonstrated the benefits of using carbon dioxide in a heterogeneously catalyzed process without the need to operate above the critical temperature of the CO2-methanol mixture; low temperatures and pressures (95 °C, 9.5 MPa) were sufficient to achieve 98% methyl oleate yield in a tri-phasic, catalyzed process in less than 2 h [1]. Given these results, it was felt that a deeper understanding of the phase equilibria of triglycerides, diglycerides and monoglycerides with alcohols, glycerol and CO2, as well as with biodiesel fatty acid esters, would be desirable towards achieving the full benefits from use of carbon dioxide as a co-solvent. Accurate modelling of the thermodynamic behavior of triglycerides depends upon parametrization via fits to experimental data; these are unfortunately relatively scarce due to extremely low triglyceride vapor pressures and experimentally unattainable critical properties. In particular, vapor pressure measurements for triglycerides are present in only a few papers [20,21], and models designed to predict thermophysical properties reduce to a small set of group contribution approaches as proposed by Ceriani and Meirelles [22], or a segmental approach as proposed by Zong et al. [23]. Modelling the phase equilibrium of triglycerides (TG) in mixtures that contain alcohols and/or alkyl esters is also needed to describe biodiesel production systems such as the one we evaluate in this paper. Binary and ternary data are fortunately more abundant than pure component TG measurements for such systems. Various authors have explored the phase behavior of TG's with methanol [6,8,24,25], alkanes [5], supercritical carbon dioxide [26–30] and sub-critical CO2 [31–34]. Ternary systems comprising TG- CO2-FAME [35], and TG- CO2-alcohol [36] have also been explored experimentally. Modelling of binary mixtures that include triglycerides has been explored previously. Bamberger et al. used a lattice equation of state to obtain good results and reasonable binary interaction coefficients (less than 13%) that correlate the solubility of different TG's in supercritical carbon dioxide [30]. Well known cubic equations of state show high accuracy predicting the behavior of some binary mixtures of triglycerides and CO2 [6,21,36–38] although most require temperature dependent binary interaction coefficients. Similarly, the triglyceride-methanol system has been analyzed with cubic equations of state and non-idealities have been considered using UNIFAC and UNIQUAC activity coefficient models; these also require temperature dependent binary coefficients to produce accurate descriptions of the phase behavior [24,39]. A number of researchers have employed the Group Contribution Equation of State (GC EoS) to model the phase behavior of mixtures that include TG's. Bottini et al. modelled triglyceride + alkane binary mixtures [40], Fornari et al. analyzed the solubility of tri-, di- and monoglycerides in supercritical carbon dioxide [41], Fernandez-Ronco et al. described CO2-triglycerides vapor-liquid equilibria behavior [42], and Espinosa et al. modelled the mixture data of fatty oils with various near-critical and supercritical solvents [43]. Temperature dependent binary interaction coefficients were required in these systems in order to obtain a reasonable representation of the phase behavior. Diglycerides (DG) and monoglycerides (MG) are intermediates of the conversion of TG's to the fatty acid esters that comprise biodiesel. These compounds are somewhat more hydrophilic than the original triglycerides given their hydroxyl groups, and hence may help to increase triglyceride content in the polar reactive phase. Thermophysical data for these compounds are scarce and are generally associated with results for multi-component systems that contain some mono- or di-glycerides [44–46], or measurements performed in supercritical carbon dioxide [26,29]. Modelling of the behavior of DG's and MG's has previously been performed using traditional cubic equations of state [29,47], however challenges arise for these EoS's when considering multicomponent systems where both multiple associations and polar forces are present. Other thermodynamic models, such as UNIFAC, UNIQUAC and NRTL excess Gibb's models, as well as the GC EoS have been tested [41,47]. These systems require fitting a large number of binary parameters, and little to no binary data was considered on isolated MG or DG systems during parameter optimization. The Perturbed Chain Statistical Association Fluid Theory Equation of State (PC-SAFT EoS) [48] has been used successfully to model biodiesel related systems, mostly those containing mixtures of FAME's and/or FAEE's with lower molecular weight components such as alcohols and carbon dioxide. PC-SAFT EoS has yet to be used to model triglyceride mixture behavior (with reactants and products of the biodiesel reaction), possibly because triglycerides do not entirely fit the description of a chain of Lennard-Jones spheres employed during the initial derivation of PC-SAFT. However, the model has been applied to systems such as highly branched alkanes, crosslinked compounds and aromatics with considerable success [49–52]. In a previous paper, we have shown that the PC-SAFT EoS can provide accurate descriptions of the phase behavior of various biodiesel components (FAME's, alcohols, CO2, glycerol), alone or in binary and ternary mixtures [2]. For this work the polar version of PC-SAFT proposed by NgueynHuynh et al. was employed [53] to model the phase behavior of various glycerides in binary and ternary mixtures with methanol and CO2. Further, some experimental data regarding the phase behavior of monoglycerides in CO2 were collected to supplement the current relatively scant literature data set on these compounds. The objective was to provide a method to systematically model tri-, di- and monoglycerides in mixtures with other common biodiesel components where carbon dioxide is employed as a co-solvent. The ultimate aim is to support prediction of the phase behavior of biodiesel transesterification performed at conditions and compositions similar to those used by Soh et al. [1]."
1,The equation of state,"The Statistical Association Fluid Theory (SAFT) derived by Chapman et al. [53] is designed to capture non-idealities and molecular interactions at different levels. Based on Wertheim's [54–57] first-order perturbation theory, the Helmholtz free energy of a fluid in SAFT is modelled as an expansion dependent on the Helmholtz free energy of a reference system perturbed by the residual free energy due to different interaction forces. Gross and Sadowski [48] later chose the reference fluid as a mixture of chains composed of Lennard-Jones spherical segments. They modified the Lennard-Jones term to account for residual free energy due to dispersion forces approximating second order perturbation integrals proposed by Chiew et al. [58]. Association forces were calculated with the term proposed in the original SAFT EoS but with a modified square well potential function to account for soft repulsion. Twu et al. [59] developed a theory to account for electrostatic and anisotropic interaction between polar molecules that was later modified and extended for chain molecules by NguyenHuynh et al. [60] so it could be applied as a third perturbation term to the PC-SAFT model, accounting for long range dipole and quadrupole interactions as shown in eq. (1). (1) A = A h c + A d i s p + A A s s o c + A M u l t i p o l a r Here A refers to the Helmholtz free energy of the fluid, a sum of the Helmholtz free energies due to the hard chain reference fluid ( A h c ), dispersion forces ( A d i s p ), association due to hydrogen bonding ( A A s s o c ), and polar and induced polar interactions ( A M u l t i p o l a r ). All terms in eq. (1) were previously developed for SAFT, PC-SAFT and PPC-SAFT, where the full mathematical expressions can be found in the literature [48,53,60]. In order to describe the phase behavior of each pure component, up to seven molecular parameters are fitted to saturation and other thermophysical data. Components that do not exhibit hydrogen bonding nor a polar moment are fully described by three parameters: segment number (m), segment diameter ( σ i ) , and molecule dispersive potential ( ε i ) corresponding to Lennard-Jones spheres in a chain. Associating molecules require two additional parameters, the volumetric overlap of association sites ( κ A B ) and the energy potential for bonding sites ( ε A B ) . Finally, polar forces are estimated using two additional parameters: the fraction of the molecule considered polar/quadrupolar ( x p ⋅ m ) and the dipole or quadrupole moment (μ/Q); this last parameter is conventionally adopted directly from literature dipole moment data. For multicomponent mixtures, combining rules are used to calculate the average parameters of the overall fluid. Literature binary phase equilibria data are used to reduce prediction errors that result from these combining rules by the fitting of binary interaction coefficients (k ij 's) as shown below. Lorentz-Berthelot and CR1 mixing rules are used for mixtures of unlike segments in combination with the PPC-SAFT EoS and are shown in eqs. (2)–(5). (2) σ i j = σ i i + σ j j 2 (3) ε i j = ε i i ⋅ ε j j ⋅ ( 1 − k i j ) (4) ε A i B j = ε A i B i + ε A j B j 2 (5) κ A i B j = κ A i B i ⋅ κ A j B j To further render predictions using PC-SAFT more tractable, Tamouza et al. [61], Hemptinne et al. [62] and NguyenHuynh et al. [63] employed group contribution techniques to parametrize long chain tri, di and monoglycerides, and alkyl-esters in a systematic way. The equations to obtain these molecular parameters are shown below (eqs. (6)–(9)): (6) σ = ∑ k = 1 n g r o u p s n k σ k n g (7) ε = ∏ k = 1 n g r o u p s ε k n k n G (8) m = ∑ k = 1 n g r o u p s n k R k (9) n G = ∑ k = 1 n g r o u p s n k where n k is the number of groups of type k in the molecule, R k is group contribution to the number of segments, σ k is the group contribution to the segment diameter, and ε k is the group contribution to the dispersive energy."
2,Phase modelling and parameter fitting,"Traditional algorithms to calculate phase boundaries (Henley [64]) such as dew points and bubble points, as well as isothermal isobaric flash procedures and the Gibbs energy minimization method (Michelsen [65–67]), were applied in this work to calculate binary and multiple component phase equilibria. Binary interaction coefficients have been fitted using available data via a simple Nelder-Mead minimization algorithm applied to eq (10). (10) % A A D = 1 N p o i n t s ∑ i Ω i e x p − Ω i c a l c Ω i e x p where Ω i e x p are the experimental data points of the thermodynamic property of interest and Ω i c a l c are the predicted properties from the model."
3,Experimental data,"Materials: CO2 was obtained from Matheson (99.9% bone dry), and methanol (HPLC grade 99.9%) purchased from Sigma Aldrich; each was used without further purification. Food grade monoglycerides with >95% purity as reported by TheScienceKit Store for monostearate and New Directions Australia for monocaprylate were also used as received. Phase Behavior Measurements: Phase behavior data for mixtures were acquired using a high-pressure variable volume view cell (VVVC) manufactured by D.B. Robinson and Associates. The apparatus consists of a steel casing with aligned front and back sapphire windows that allows for visual inspection of the selected sample. The volume of the sample can be varied using a movable piston which is displaced using silicone oil as the overburden fluid. The internal pressure is monitored and controlled with the use of two syringe pumps that are operated with a closed loop electronic controller system. One pump corresponds to the silicone oil fluid and a second one controls the CO2 displaced into the cell. The system is encased in a constant temperature housing [68]. A schematic of the experimental setup used is shown in Fig. 1 . Liquid-vapor and liquid-liquid data were acquired by introducing known amounts of material into the sample cell. The desired temperature was set, and the pressure was increased until a single phase was formed. After allowing for mechanical equilibrium to be reached, the pressure was lowered by expanding the liquid at very slow volumetric rates varying from 20 to 50 cc/hr. When the incipient formation of either a vapor or a second liquid phase was noticed, the pumping system was stopped, and the system was allowed once more to reach mechanical and chemical equilibrium between the phases. Similar procedures have previously been used and verified [69–71]; each data point was performed in duplicate. Errors for pressure measurements were calculated as standard deviation from the two-fold measurements and composition uncertainties were calculated through dispersion error formulas of instruments measuring uncertainty and measurements fluctuation following guidelines from Khu [72]."
4,Pure component parameters,"PC-SAFT pure component parameters for methanol, ethanol, and carbon dioxide were taken from Mourah et al. [73] and NguyenHuynh et al. [74]. Glycerol PC-SAFT parameters were those derived previously by Rodriguez and Beckman [2]. The pure component parameters for long chain tri-, di-, and monoglycerides were calculated using a group contribution approach (GC-PPCSAFT) as proposed by Tamouza et al. [61], Hemptinne et al. [62] and NguyenHuynh et al. [63,74] that has previously been used by us to model the behavior of mixtures of fatty acid methyl esters with carbon dioxide [2]. Group contribution is a systematic procedure that can easily be extended to systems where data is scarce when the molecules under consideration share structural similarities (i.e. alkyl-esters, triglycerides, etc.). The pure component parameters of each chain-like substance were calculated using eq (6) through (9) and the information in Table 1 corresponding to basic molecular subgroups present in the molecules of interest. The tri-ester group present in triglycerides could be regarded as a unique molecular subgroup; for simplicity the PPC-SAFT parameters of the tri-ester core were calculated as a combination of 3 ester groups, 2 methylene bridges and 1 methine group for the purposes of this study. Fitting unique parameters for the tri-ester core was explored using data from Perry et al. [20] but significant improvement was not observed for any of the binary or ternary systems explored in this work. In consequence, the group contribution approach was used to calculate all pure component parameters for the acyl-glycerides and no pure component data was therefore required to perform the multicomponent phase equilibria calculations in subsequent sections. The experimental value of the dipole moment (μ) of the molecule is usually inserted directly into the model and then the polar fraction of the molecule ( x p ⋅ m ) found through fitting to pure component phase behavior. The x p ⋅ m value accounts for the fraction of the molecule that contributes to the dipolar moment, which theoretically is the entirety of the molecular structure. However, for practical reasons it has been treated as adjustable parameter ever since PC-SAFT was extended using this polar term [60]. Due to the paucity of existing vapor pressure data from which to fit the polar parameters, the x p ⋅ m value was fixed to the theoretical value of 1, and the dipole moment was fixed to the value of 2.7 D for saturated glycerides and 3.12 D for any unsaturated glycerides, based on data available for triolein, trilaurin and glycerol as well as property estimation databases for other triglycerides [75–79]. During this work it was found that inclusion of the polar term is unnecessary to accurately model triglycerides (although very important for small molecules such as methanol and glycerol). Throughout this work, stochastic changes were made to polar parameters in order to measure the impact that the above-mentioned assumptions have over phase behavior predictions and were found to have little to no effect. Nevertheless, the polar term was retained in the description of glyceride behavior to preserve all model features, particularly because other components of the biodiesel transesterification (methanol, glycerol, etc.) require the inclusion of this term in the EoS for accuracy [2]."
5,Results: binary systems,
6,Triglycerides-CO2,"6.1 Triglycerides-CO2 Binary mixtures of triglycerides and carbon dioxide have been evaluated using the pure component parameters from Table 1 while fitting binary interaction coefficients to available mixture data. Most of the collected data is LVE or LLE where the temperature is above carbon dioxide's critical value. In the case of triglycerides most data shows that the extent of swelling of the TG's by CO2 is weakly dependent on both temperature and pressure. Consequentially the modelled phase equilibria of the binary systems exhibit steep slopes in P-T space (see Fig. 2 ). This represents a source for significant prediction error given the form of the objective function (eq. (10)) and the influence that small changes in the binary parameters have over the composition values. As mentioned earlier, triglycerides are not strictly chain molecules within the context of PC-SAFT, and therefore the use of the model introduces a fundamental problem that translates into higher errors when predicting the pressure or temperature of a phase transition. Another relevant source of error relates to the purity of components used to acquire the experimental data since variations in lipid content as well as impurities can shift the phase behavior significantly; high purity glycerides are not always easy to obtain, as noted by a number of experimentalists [21,33,34,80]. Eight binary systems containing CO2 and various triglycerides have been considered to generate an overall binary interaction coefficient for TG-CO2 mixtures in general. As can be seen in Fig. 2, shorter chain triglycerides such as tributyrin and tricaproin require negative binary interaction coefficients to produce a reasonable fit -- this is an indication that the group contribution parameters do not fully describe the tri-ester core of these molecules. However, the absolute values of the binary interaction coefficients are small (less than 3% generally), and good descriptions of the binary phase behavior are supported. Naturally, the impact of the triglyceride ester core on the overall fit is somewhat mitigated as the length of the carbon chain increases. A higher number of methylene groups increases the influence that such groups have on dispersive forces as is well captured by the averaging expressions in eq (6) through (9). That part of the phase boundary of the triglyceride-CO2 binary where carbon dioxide content is low also shows larger errors, possibly due to the error prediction of pure triglyceride vapor pressure. Overall prediction errors for composition on the liquid phase ranged from 1.2 to 7.3% with an average of 2.5%, as shown in Table 2 . In a fully predictive model k ij should approach zero. However, due to the approximation introduced by the equation of state (mainly geometric and arithmetic averages of the square well and Lennard-Jones spherical segments parameters) the use of a binary interaction coefficient is required (to compensate for these approximation errors). Fig. 3 compares the effect of k ij = 0, with the optimized value from Table 3 . The non-polar version of the EoS (PC-SAFT) has also been included for comparison purposes, showing that higher values of k ij are required if this version is used, but a good description of the phase behavior can still be achieved. To strengthen the predictability of the model, the effect of a unique formula to calculate the binary interaction parameter was investigated, so that the model can be easily extended to different types of triglycerides beyond the ones studied in this work. The binary interaction parameters were found to closely correlate with the carbon chain length and the degree of unsaturation of the triglycerides as shown in Fig. 4 . As such, a general binary interaction coefficient was established via fitting against chain length, and, with information from tristearin, triolein and the rapeseed oil, against the number of double bonds in the triglyceride chain. The result is shown in eq (11). (11) k i j = ( 0.00372 * x − 0.03457 ) * e − 0.698 * y where x is the average number of carbons in the fatty chains and y the average number of double bonded carbons in the fatty chains. The penalty in prediction error for using eq (11) can be compared to the substance-particular k i j fitting shown in Table 2. Oils containing multiple types of triglycerides, as is the case for rapeseed oil, have been treated as a single pseudo-component as suggested by different authors [36,81,82] and performed in an earlier work [2] for fatty acid methyl esters and ethyl esters, by averaging all of the group contribution parameters of all present groups in the oil."
7,Monoglycerides-CO2,"6.2 Monoglycerides-CO2 The group contribution approach described above was also used to model mixtures of monoglycerides with carbon dioxide. For the hydroxyl groups in the first and second positions on the carbon chain, a 3B association scheme (two electron donor sites and 1 electron acceptor) was employed, with an additional cross association site due to the ester group. The volumetric overlap of the association term ( κ A B ) is in general taken as a unique value for the homonuclear approach, thus it was calculated as a geometric mean of the volumetric overlap for each of the hydroxyls and ester groups considered in the group contribution scheme shown in Table 1. Few experimental phase behavior data are available for CO2 + monoglyceride mixtures. Data from the literature plus experimental data collected in this work were used to estimate binary interaction coefficients. As mentioned before, a weak dependence of CO2 solubility (in the heavy MG-rich phase) on temperature and pressure is the main source of error. This can be appreciated by noting the marginal difference in CO2 solubility between two different temperatures as shown in the experimental data collected in Table 3 and depicted in Fig. 5 for monostearin and monocaprylin. All collected and modelled data shown in Table 3 correspond to a saturated liquid (the heavy phase) which can be in equilibrium with either a vapor phase (LVE transition) or a second liquid phase (LLE transition), where the second phase is composed mainly of carbon dioxide. Relatively low values (approximately 3%) of the binary interaction coefficients were obtained. A generalized parameter using the CO2-monostearin and CO2-monocaprylin systems was calculated, although it was difficult to establish the optimal solution because the minimization curve was very flat. Biasing the solution towards the monocaprylin (k ij = 0.0091) or towards the monostearin (k ij = 0.0361) altered the objective function by only 0.3%. Therefore, the midpoint was selected so to have a binary interaction coefficient that is not strongly substance biased. Nonetheless higher errors relatively to those obtained with triglycerides are registered for monoglycerides, due to the small number of candidate MG's, the assumptions made during fitting, and the relatively low purity of the monoglyceride samples. It is important to highlight the negative effects of this last-mentioned source of error, since the phase equilibria measurements can be significantly effected by the presence of impurities in the original sample. Some of the potential impurities present have strong associative and dispersive forces (i.e. glycerine and water) that play a role in modifying the loci of the CO2 saturated liquid phase boundary in an LLE situation."
8,Diglycerides-CO2,"6.3 Diglycerides-CO2 Mixture data for diglycerides and CO2 are scarce, possibly due to difficulties associated with the separation processes required to obtain relatively pure DG samples for testing. Two references [26,29] on supercritical extraction contain information for diglycerides and CO2 but only the compositions in the light supercritical phase are available in the form of dew point measurements (shown in Fig. 6 ). All predicted data points using GC-PPC-SAFT correctly show a dew point composition that closely matches the expected experimental values. However, because the compositions of this “light” end of the phase envelope are always above 99% CO2, the binary interaction parameters obtained using this data (Table 4 ) are not expected to fully match the ones obtained from the glyceride-rich branch of the diagram. Pure component parameters for diglycerides have been calculated using the group contribution technique with one hydroxyl group and two ester groups while maintaining the association schemes shown in Table 1. Values of the binary interaction coefficients can be adjusted in order to capture the progressive solubility of mono-, di-, and triglycerides extracted with supercritical carbon dioxide, as done previously by other authors [47]. However, parameters obtained in this way are less reliable than desired since they represent the steepest side of the phase envelope, whose locus is more sensitive to small changes. Therefore, only diglyceride-specific information has been incorporated into a generalized parameter for CO2-diglycerides, obtaining k i j = 0.0144 for both diolein and dilaurin given that no other experimental data are available."
9,Triglycerides-methanol,"6.4 Triglycerides-methanol Despite the importance of this binary system to the overall performance of the transesterification process for biodiesel, there are surprisingly few data available on the phase equilibria of triglycerides and short chain alcohols. These mixtures exhibit large differences in polarity and in carbon chain length, prompting large changes in equilibrium composition upon small changes in temperature or pressure (as can be seen by the bubble and cloud points measured by Tang et al. [6], and the corresponding cloud and bubble points predicted and shown in Fig. 7 ). Upon fitting of the available data, these binaries exhibited the largest errors between actual and predicted curves and required one of the higher values for the binary interaction coefficient that we encountered. Following equation (3), the lower the values for k ij the more accurate the basic model is, since the averaging approximations used by the combining rules for chains of unlike segments are closer to experimental data. The triolein methanol system has the highest values of binary interaction coefficients amongst all the studied systems, which suggests lower reliability of subsequent predictions as compared to the previous results in this work. However, k ij values below 12% are sufficient to obtain the best possible phase equilibria representation. Predictions of phase behavior when methanol composition is high are correctly captured by the model in terms of the nominal value of equilibrium composition and a low dependence on pressure and temperature. However large deviations can be observed at lower methanol mole fractions associated with inaccuracies in predicted pure component properties for triglycerides."
10,Triglycerides-glycerol,"6.5 Triglycerides-glycerol Due to the obvious immiscibility of the components involved in this binary system the only data available are liquid-liquid equilibria at low pressure and temperatures collected by Silva et al. [25] that show an average solubility of 0.7% of the triglyceride in the glycerol-rich phase, and 1% glycerol in the non-polar glyceride-rich phase. A binary interaction coefficient has been fitted to the available information, obtaining k i j = 0.0569. The model representation is only accurate on the oleic-rich branch of the phase envelope (average error is 0.3%). By contrast, the model is unable to capture the trace amounts of triglycerides in the glycerol-rich phase, rather predicting a practically pure phase for all conditions."
11,Results: ternary systems,
12,CO2-methanol-monoglyceride,"7.1 CO2-methanol-monoglyceride It was not possible to locate literature data for mixtures of methanol with di- and monoglycerides. Instead, experimental ternary phase diagrams containing methanol and monoglycerides with CO2 were plotted, as shown in Table 5 . As explained in section 7.2 the experimental data available correspond to the monoglyceride-rich liquid phase in equilibrium with a CO2-rich phase. These data were then used to fit the missing binary interaction coefficients for the methanol-glyceride binaries. An overall optimization was performed, obtaining k i j = 0.12 for the methanol-monoglyceride pair, which is consistent with values obtained for the methanol-triglyceride system. As shown in Fig. 8 the model correctly predicts general trends showing higher vapor pressures for higher methanol contents but lower cloud point pressures when supercritical conditions for CO2 are reached. However, the model shows a large departure from experimental behavior in the steepest region of the phase diagram (LLE) at high CO2 composition. This behavior has been observed previously in mixtures containing glycerol, where the predicted solubility in the LLE regime does not increase with pressure in the same way as the data do [2]."
13,Monoglycerides-glycerol-fatty acid methyl esters (FAME),"7.2 Monoglycerides-glycerol-fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) Negi et al. [44] performed measurements of the ternary system containing glycerol, methyl oleate and monoolein that provides valuable information about how the phase behavior of the biodiesel reaction system evolves as intermediates and products are formed. Since long chain molecules closely follow the group contribution approach, the FAME-glycerides binary interaction coefficient has been set to zero, consistent with previous findings [2]. All compositions where the experimental value was below 2% molar were excluded from the minimization function to prevent the optimization from being strongly biased towards these points. It was found that a binary interaction parameter of k i j = 0.0145 for the glycerol-monoolein pair was sufficient to correctly capture the liquid-liquid equilibria at 135 °C. As noted by Negi et al., different variations of the UNIFAC equations of state exhibit large errors predicting the composition of the co-existing phases when significant amounts of monoglyceride are present [44]. Monoolein exhibits somewhat of a cosolvent effect, as can be appreciated by the larger glycerol contents in the oleic phase – this is probably due to the hydrogen bonding potential of the monoolein, and can only be captured correctly with an EoS such as the GC-PPCSAFT, that explicitly accounts for these forces as shown in Fig. 9 (the corresponding data can be found on Table A.1 in the appendix)."
14,Carbon dioxide - ethanol – triglyceride,"7.3 Carbon dioxide - ethanol – triglyceride A ternary mixture of carbon dioxide, ethanol and rapeseed oil was modelled using parameters from Table 1 and the procedure described in section 7.1 for rapeseed oil. The binary interaction parameter between the triglyceride and ethanol was set to zero, making these diagrams effectively a pure prediction based on previous calculations of systems containing carbon dioxide as calculated in section 7.1 and the binary interaction coefficient calculated by NguyenHuynh et al. [74] for CO2 and alcohols. As can be seen in Fig. 10 , there is good agreement between the model and experimental data, with an increased error towards the higher isobars. Comparable results were obtained by Geana and Steiner [36] by fitting multiple parameters directly to this ternary system using a cubic EoS. The prediction error in the current work was estimated to be 10% in mole fraction (select data available on Table A.2 in the appendix)."
15,Conclusions,"The PC-SAFT model modified with a polar term was employed to evaluate the phase behavior of various tri-, di- and monoglycerides mixed with those small molecules relevant to biodiesel reactions where CO2 is used as a cosolvent. As expected, the model handles well the binary interaction of the glycerides with other components but is not nearly as accurate when predicting the pure component properties of the triglycerides themselves, which leads to larger errors in binary systems at very high molar concentrations of glycerides. Because little data regarding binary mixtures of monoglycerides with small molecules are available, experimental results on the MG-methanol-CO2 ternary were acquired and used to extract the binary interaction coefficient between MG's and methanol. In general, errors in predicted phase envelope loci for these glyceride systems were higher than for analogous binary and ternary mixtures containing the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES), likely owing to higher errors in predicting pure component glyceride properties than for the FAMES. However, the model was able to provide good descriptions of ternary systems that incorporate the key components of a biodiesel-oriented esterification reaction where CO2 is employed as a cosolvent. The parameters calculated in this work complete the necessary basis to perform phase behavior predictions of methanolysis and ethanolysis of triglyceride reactive systems. Also, they provide a valuable virtual source to calculate optimal thermodynamic conditions to increase the solubility of the transesterification reactants when carbon dioxide is employed as a co-solvent in the reaction. Moreover, they allow one to investigate the behavior of all reactants, products and intermediaries of the biodiesel reaction in the phase separation throughout the reaction process, and how CO2 can modify such phase separation when operating at sub-critical conditions of the mixture."
