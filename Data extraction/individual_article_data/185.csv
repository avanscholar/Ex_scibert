0,Introduction,"Ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional organic solvents and have therefore gained immense importance in the last couple of decades [1, 2]. Since ILs are comprised entirely of ions, their unique physicochemical properties, as generally characterized by negligible volatility, low flammability, good chemical and thermal stability, and broad electrochemical window, can be tailored simply by changing the chemical structure of the component ions [1,3-8]. For practical use in diverse applications, the molecular design of ILs has, thus, been the most fascinating domain of current research [9,10]. There are two major ways to design the structure and function of an ionic liquid. First, by changing the structure of component ions, providing task-specific ILs. Second, mixing ILs with other components, such as other ILs and conventional solvents, also leads to changes in the properties of ILs [11]. The mixing of ILs with other molecular liquids could be a preferred way of tuning their properties rather than modifying the structural design of neat ILs. Further, external perturbations such as pressure and electric fields on ILs can also be used to modify the IL properties for desired applications [12-17]. In the recent years, several investigations on the structure and dynamics of IL + cosolvent systems have been done through both experimental [11,18-27] and theoretical approaches [28-37]. Alkylimidazolium ionic liquids, especially ILs based on 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cation, have been among the most studied ILs because of their remarkable properties and the simplicity of synthetic methods for producing them [38]. Moreover, the ILs comprising NTf 2 − offer many advantages, some of which include good hydrolytic and electrochemical stability, high stability against degradation caused by air and high thermal stability [39]. Among the numerous molecular solvents available, the n-alkanols group has large relevance. The ability to develop hydrogen bonding through homo- and hetero-associations controls the behaviour of n-alkanols [35]. In the search of finding a molecular compound that can weaken the strong ion-pairing behaviour of the ionic liquids and can enhance the kinetic performance of the IL-based systems, many research groups have studied binary mixtures of ILs with different molecular organic solvents. These studies have provided significant insights on structural and dynamic properties of IL-based mixtures. Prezhdo and co-workers have shown how the addition of acetonitrile enhances the ionic conductivity of imidazolium based ILs, which are usually extremely viscous and render moderate conductivity [31]. Recently, Aparicio and group have performed MD studies on Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + ethanol mixtures, where they have observed strong interactions between the anion and ethanol along with significant electrostatic interactions between Im 1 , 4 + and NTf 2 − [35]. Experimentally, it has been observed by Harper et al. that by changing the composition of the IL + cosolvent mixture, the course and the outcome of a reaction can also be changed [40]. Further, Fayer et al. have investigated the role of hydrogen bonding in 1-ethylimidazolium (Ehim+)/ NTf 2 − + water and Emim+/ NTf 2 − + water binary mixtures. It was illustrated that based on the kind of interactions among water molecules in the two mixtures, the cations of the two ILs experience different extent of hydrogen bonding [41]. Moreover, recently, it has also been shown how the kinetics of an electron transfer reaction can be affected in the presence of IL + cosolvent mixture [42]. All these noteworthy observations demonstrate that addition of different kinds of organic solvents to such ILs can alter their structural properties, which further make them of great utility. In this work, we have focused particularly on the composition dependent structure of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − mixed with 1-propanol (PrOH) and with 1-butanol (BuOH). There are numerous practical applications of the IL Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − including its use in CO2 gas absorption, metal extraction, azeotrope separation [43-47]. Several experimental studies have already been performed on the binary mixtures of this IL with alcohols that provide important data on surface tension, density, viscosity, excess properties, conductivity, etc [48-54]. However, a detailed understanding of the relationship between ions molecular structure, intermolecular forces governing the structural organization of these mixtures, which would help in understanding the behaviour of the properties reported, are yet to be explored. For this purpose, computational studies can give a better insight in understanding the structure of these mixtures over a wide range of composition. In order to get a clear picture of the effect of alcohol on the structure of Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − and vice-versa, the composition-dependent structure of Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + PrOH and Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + BuOH mixtures have been studied by employing MD simulations and via computation of X-ray scattering structure functions, radial distribution functions and three-dimensional spatial distribution functions. This study is important because in both the neat IL and the neat alcohols, the liquid structure is primarily governed by hydrogen-bonding interaction."
1,Simulation details,"All the simulations were carried out utilizing GROMACS [55,56] molecular dynamics program suite. Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − , PrOH and BuOH (refer to Fig. 1 for their chemical structures) were modeled by using non-polarizable atomistic force-field from all-atom optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS-AA) [57-60] in combination with AMBER [61,62] as parametrized by Lopes and Pádua (CL&P) [63, 64]. The initial simulation boxes for the neat liquids and the binary mixtures were built using the PACKMOL program [65]. A total of 1000 molecules (ionic pair + alcohol) were taken in a cubic box for each composition. Periodic boundary conditions and minimum image convention were applied. For the IL mole fractions below 0.5, because of faster equilibration process, equilibration runs were carried out for 10 ns in isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble using Berendsen thermostat and barostat [66], followed by production runs using Parrinello-Rahman barostat [67] and Nosé-Hoover thermostat [68-70], for 5 ns. The trajectory frames were saved at every 10 fs to compute the properties. For x IL = 0.5 and beyond, equilibration was carried out for 30 ns, followed by a production run of 10 ns, where, the trajectory frames were saved at every 50 fs. However, in case of Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + BuOH mixture, for x IL = 0.8 and 0.9, production runs were carried out for 20 ns instead of 10 ns for better statistical averaging of the properties studied. The temperature and pressure were maintained at 298 K and 1 bar, respectively for both equilibration and production runs. The equations of motion were solved using leap-frog algorithm with a time-step of 1 fs. A cutoff distance of 1.2 nm was used to handle the short range interactions. Long range electrostatic interactions were taken into account by particle-mesh-Ewald (PME) [71,72] summation technique with an interpolation order of 6 and a Fourier grid spacing of 0.08 nm. Lennard-Jones off-diagonal terms were evaluated using the geometric mean of the diagonal terms. X-ray scattering static structure functions, S(q)s were calculated using the total sum of atom-type-based partial components (S ij (q)). The details of the X-ray S(q) calculations can be found elsewhere [33,73-75]. It is important to mention that total and partial S(q)s below q = 0.25 Å−1 have not been shown in the plots as no physical significance can be attributed to S(q) below q=2π / R, where R = L / 2. The atom-type-based radial distribution functions (g ij (r) or RDF) have been calculated by standard means. Here, g ij (r) refers to the partial radial distribution function for the atomic species of type i and j [55,56]. Spatial distribution functions (SDFs) were calculated using TRAVIS [76] and rendered by VMD package [77]. Calculations of coordination number N c o o r i j of jth species from the ith species have been performed by integrating the corresponding radial distribution functions from the central molecule to the first solvation shell (first minimum in the RDF), as given by N c o o r i j = 4 π ρ j ∫ 0 r m i n g i j ( r ) r 2 d r , where r min is the location of the first minimum in the RDF, g ij (r), and ρ j represents the bulk density of the jth species."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Comparison of simulated density against experimental data,"3.1 Comparison of simulated density against experimental data A comparison of the density values predicted from the MD simulations with the experimental data [50] for both the mixtures are shown in Fig. 2 (a)–(b) and tabulated in Table 1 . Note that while there is an excellent agreement between both the results for the alcohol-rich concentrations, the agreement is fairly good for the IL-rich concentrations. As observed in the experimental data, a non-linear dependence of the simulated density on the IL mole fraction is found for both the mixtures."
4,"Simulated X-ray scattering structure function, S(q)","3.2 Simulated X-ray scattering structure function, S(q) The simulated total X-ray structure functions for the mixtures of Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + PrOH and Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + BuOH over a range of compositions are shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), respectively. For neat alcohols (PrOH and BuOH), two distinct scattering peaks are observed in the total S(q). The lowest q-peak occurs at 0.74 Å−1 for PrOH and 0.59 Å−1 for BuOH. The higher q peak for both PrOH and BuOH is centered around 1.47 Å−1. It is also seen that the intensities of both the peaks for BuOH are slightly higher than that for PrOH. These observations for the neat alcohols are in accordance with the previously reported experimental and simulated results [78]. Note that in the case of NTf 2 − based neat ionic liquids consisting of cations with longer alkyl tails (six carbon atoms or more), three peaks (0.2–2.0 Å−1) are commonly observed in the S(q). A low q peak (prepeak or first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP)) occurs at q around 0.2–0.6 Å−1, which is a characteristic peak of nanoscale structural heterogeneity corresponding to polarity alternations, an intermediate peak at q around 0.6–1.0 Å−1 known as charge ordering peak, and the higher q peak appears at q around 1.5 Å−1 belonging to all sorts of close-contact or nearest-neighbour correlations and is termed as adjacency correlation (AC) peak [73,74,79-83]. In case of the neat IL, Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − , we, thus, observe only two peaks, charge ordering peak at q = 0.88 Å−1 and high q peak at q = 1.43 Å−1. The same observation has also been reported through experimental measurements carried out by Kaeveney et al. [40,84]. It is important to note that even on an addition of 10% IL, the low q feature at q ∼ 0.6 Å−1 (long range ordering) of the neat alcohol is vanished. Further, from Figs. S1(a)-S1 (c) and S2(a)-S2 (c) in the Supplementary material, it can be easily understood that the peak at q around 0.8 Å−1 in the total structure function is due to positive cation-cation and anion-anion correlations and negative cation-anion correlation in both the mixtures, which implies charge ordering. Moreover, it can be gleaned through Fig. 3 (a) and (b) that the lower q peak for x IL = 0.2 (q 0.2 = 0.76 Å−1) is shifting to higher q values (maximum for x IL = 1.0, q 1.0 = 0.88 Å−1) or towards shorter length scales with a slight increase in intensity. The corresponding change in length scale Δ R = 2 π 1 q 0.2 − 1 q 1.0 for this charge ordering is found to be around 1.1 Å for both the mixtures. However, there is a decrease in intensity for the higher q peak, with its position remaining almost the same. The enhancement in the low-q peak's intensity depicts increased charge ordering which is expected as the mixture approaches towards ionic liquid rich concentrations. It should also be noted that beyond x IL = 0.3, the position of the low q peak remains almost the same indicating small change in the corresponding characteristic length scale beyond this mole fraction. Similar observations were also found for the mixtures of Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + acetonitrile [40]. Further, peaks and anti-peaks in the structure functions are observed due to off-phase density alternation [73]. Other partial S(q)s are also shown in Figs. S1 and S2 of the Supplementary material. Moreover, we observe an excess scattering at lowest q region (q → 2π/R) which is relevant to mesoscopic spatial scale structural heterogeneity present in the mixtures. This complex behaviour, which has already been reported for different binary mixtures by various groups, is known to arise primarily due to mesoscopic density or concentration fluctuations corresponding to q min ∼ 2π/R in simulations [37,85-91]. In the present study, we observe that the density fluctuation is maximum for x IL = 0.1 and decreases till x IL = 0.9. In addition, we observe an additional feature in between q min and 0.5 Å−1 for Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + PrOH mixture, which is quite evident for x IL = 0.1. In order to further verify the existence of the lowest q features in the mixtures studied, experimental evidences, such as carried out by Triolo et al. 90], are required since the minimum q approachable in simulations is limited by due to finite box size effect."
5,Spatial isodensity surfaces,"3.3 Spatial isodensity surfaces 3.3.1 Neat Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − , PrOH The spatial isodensity surfaces depicting the nearest solvation shells around the cation in the neat ionic liquid Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − and around PrOH in neat PrOH are shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (c). The atomic isodensity surfaces are shown in Fig. 4 (b) and (d) respectively. The spatial isodensity surface of a species (cationic, anionic or alcohol) has been calculated by taking all the atoms of that species unless otherwise mentioned. Fig. 4 (b) depicts that the isodensity surface of NTf 2 − is mainly concentrated around the ring of the cation. There are primarily three lobes corresponding to the anion around the cation, the bigger one near the H4 hydrogen, the other two near the H6 and H8 hydrogens of the ring, justifying the fact that ring hydrogens are more acidic due to the concentration of positive charge in the ring, particularly near the C-H4 atom pair. This observation is consistent with the results of other MD studies [92] on ILs containing Im 1 , 4 + with different anions. From these studies, it is found that the anion prefers to associate more with C (attached to H4) carbon of the imidazolium ring since C-H4 pair constitutes the maximum amount of positive charge. In order to get an in-depth understanding of the spatial isodensity surface of NTf 2 − around Im 1 , 4 + , atomic distribution of NTf 2 − has been plotted around Im 1 , 4 + (see Fig. 4 (b)). It is observed that oxygen atoms of anion interact more with the cation than fluorine or nitrogen, which is subsequently confirmed through RDFs. In case of neat PrOH, Fig. 4 (d) shows the spatial isodensity plot of PrOH, along with the spatial isodensity surface of its polar part represented separately around a PrOH molecule. It is clearly observed that the isodensity surface of polar part is present near the hydroxyl group of PrOH, indicating significant hydrogen bonding interactions among PrOH molecules. Similar observations are seen in the case of neat BuOH (see Fig. S4 in Suppl. Mat.). 3.3.2 Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + alcohol mixtures The three dimensional spatial isodensity surfaces of NTf 2 − and Im 1 , 4 + around alcohol molecules have been shown in Fig. 5 (a)–(d) for Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + PrOH and in Fig. 6 (a)–(d) for Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + BuOH mixtures. From these figures, it can be clearly seen that the cation and the anion of Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − remain mainly near the polar part of the alcohol irrespective of the change in x IL. Moreover, cation and anion surfaces contain alcohol surfaces and in addition, there is an alternate isodensity surface of anion and cation respectively for ionic liquid rich concentrations. Additionally, the isodensity surfaces for oxygen and hydrogen (of hydroxyl group) of alcohol molecules are plotted around alcohol for x IL = 0.5 composition of both the mixture have been plotted, which is shown in Fig. S5 of the Supplementary material. Similarly, the spatial isodensity surfaces of the anion and alcohol plotted around the cation for Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + PrOH mixtures, as shown in Fig. 7 (a)–(d) are again consistent with the radial distribution results. Similar spatial isodensity surface plots were obtained for the Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + BuOH mixtures (see Fig. S6 in Suppl. Mat.). The distribution of anion around the cation remains almost the same for different mole fractions, as that depicted for the neat IL. The spatial isodensity surfaces of PrOH around the head of the cation can be attributed to the hydrogen bonding interaction of the anion with PrOH as well as electrostatic interaction between the anion and the cation, which in turn is bringing the PrOH molecules closer to the cation ring. It is, therefore, evident from these plots that isodensity surfaces of alcohol are pronounced near the ring part and nonpolar region of the cation, implying considerable interactions between the cation and the alcohols. The isodensity surfaces of polar (hydroxyl group) and nonpolar (terminal carbon atom) parts of the alcohol molecules have also been plotted around the cation, which are depicted in Fig. 8 for IL + PrOH mixture and Fig. S7 of the Supplementary material for IL + BuOH mixture. From these figures, it can be observed that the polar part of the alcohol is near the head of the cation (similar to that observed for the anion) whereas, the nonpolar part of the alcohol is mainly localized near the tail or the methyl group of the cation. There is also some probability of finding the terminal carbon atom of the alcohols slightly away from the polar part of alcohols (two lobes present near H6 and H8 hydrogens of the cation) and the cation, which can be due to tail-tail interactions among alcohol molecules."
6,Inter- and intra-species correlations and hydrogen bonding,"3.4 Inter- and intra-species correlations and hydrogen bonding 3.4.1 Im 1 , 4 + − NTf 2 − hydrogen bonding It is observed that for imidazolium-based ILs, weak hydrogen bonding interactions persist between the acidic hydrogens (H4, H6 and H8) attached to the carbon atoms of the imidazolium ring (see Fig. 1 (c)) and the oxygen atoms of the anion (see Fig. 9 (a)–(f)). The center of mass RDF plots between Im 1 , 4 + and NTf 2 − for both the mixtures are shown in Figs. S8 (a) and S8 (c) respectively. The correlation between the anion and the cation is decreasing with the increase in x IL for both the mixtures as evident in Fig. 9. Similar trend has also been observed in the case of Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + ethanol binary mixtures [35]. Among the RDFs of H4-O, H6-O and H8-O, H4-O shows the most prominent correlation. This can be justified as C-H4 constitutes the maximum positive charge, as discussed earlier (refer Section 3.3.1), than the other two ring hydrogens, the correlation of oxygen atoms of the anion is, thus, maximum with H4 of the cation. From the RDFs, we observed that the first nearest neighbour peak for all the mixtures occurs around 0.256 nm, which remains unaffected with the change in concentration of the IL. With increasing alcohol concentration, while all the three correlations gradually increase for both the mixtures, the intensity is higher in IL + BuOH mixture than in IL + PrOH mixture as compared to that their corresponding bulk values. Further, Fig. 11 depicts that the number of oxygen atoms of the anion surrounding the ring hydrogens of the cation in the first solvation shell gradually decreases with decrease in x IL with respect to that of the neat IL. Fig. S9 of the Supplementary material also shows a similar behaviour for the coordination number of the anion around the cation obtained from their center of mass RDFs. Moreover, the coordination number is observed to increase in a nonlinear manner as a function of x IL, similar to the behaviour noted for the plot of density values against IL mole fraction. It is important to note that the trend obtained for coordination number of anion around the cation should not be confused with the trend obtained for the corresponding RDFs. The coordination number for different mole fractions will depend on the density of mixture at that mole fraction (refer to the equation in Section 2) and not merely on the geometric integration of g(r). 3.4.2 Variation of alcohol-alcohol hydrogen bonding The center of mass RDFs for alcohols in Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + PrOH and Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + BuOH mixtures are shown in Figs. S8 (b) and S8 (d) of the Supplementary material. In order to get a better picture of hydrogen bonding between the alcohol molecules, the RDFs for the hydroxyl oxygen and hydroxyl hydrogen atoms of alcohol molecules for both the mixtures are shown in Fig. 10 (a) and (b). The first and second nearest neighbour peaks in these RDFs are centered at 0.18 and 0.34 nm, respectively for the entire composition range of both the mixtures. The peak in the RDFs at 0.18 nm signifies appreciable hydrogen bonding among the alcohol molecules. A comparison of heights of the first peak of the RDFs for the neat alcohols (PrOH and BuOH) illustrates that hydrogen bonding in neat BuOH is stronger than in neat PrOH. For Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + PrOH mixture, with alcohol dilution, the alcohol-alcohol hydrogen bonding correlations increase in a gradual manner compared to what is expected from their bulk correlations. However, for Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + BuOH mixture, a significant reduction in the intensity of the peak of the RDF for x IL = 0.9 is observed. We also observe a decrease in correlation in the center of mass RDF between BuOH molecules at higher x IL (see Fig. S8(d)). These observations signify the presence of relatively weaker hydrogen bonding between BuOH molecules at x IL = 0.9. The number of hydroxyl hydrogen atoms in the first solvation shell of the oxygen atoms of the alcohol molecules, as depicted in Fig. 11 , shows a decreasing nonlinear trend with a decrease in alcohol concentration as compared to that in the neat alcohols. Similar trend is observed for the coordination number computed through the center of mass RDFs for alcohol molecules (see Fig. S9 of the Suppl. Mat.). 3.4.3 Appreciable hydrogen bonding between alcohol and NTf 2 − anion The interaction between the anion and the alcohol molecule was investigated by computing the RDFs between the electronegative atoms of the anion and the hydroxyl hydrogen of the alcohol, as shown in Fig. 12 (a) and (b). The correlation of NTf 2 − with alcohols with respect to their corresponding bulk values, increases in a continuous manner with increase in x IL. It is observed that the first peak in the RDF plot between oxygen atoms of anion and hydroxyl hydrogen atoms of alcohols occurs at 0.18 nm. However, there is no evidence of hydrogen bonding between fluorine or nitrogen of anion and hydrogen of alcohols as their first peak in RDFs occurs above 0.4 nm (see Fig. S10 in the Suppl. Mat.). This clearly indicates the presence of hydrogen bonding between the anion and the alcohols through the oxygen atoms of the anion and hydroxyl hydrogen of the alcohol. The coordination number of the hydroxyl hydrogen atoms around the oxygen atom of the anion is found to decrease with decrease in alcohol concentration (see Fig. 11). Likewise, the alcohol molecules in the nearest neighbour of the anion calculated from the corresponding center of mass RDFs, as depicted in Fig. S9 of the Supplementary material, show a similar trend. 3.4.4 Alcohol- Im 1 , 4 + correlations The possibility of hydrogen bonding between the cation and alcohol molecules was explored by computing the RDFs for the alcohol hydroxyl oxygen and the imidazolium cation ring hydrogens, which are observed to possess acidic character in the neat IL. Figs. 13 and S11 show that the nearest neighbour peaks in both the RDFs occur at around 0.26 nm, with more or less the same height across all the IL mole fractions. These observations clearly indicate the presence of appreciable correlation between the alcohol and the imidazolium cation head for both Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + PrOH and Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + BuOH mixtures across all the mole fractions. It is also elucidated through spatial isodensity surfaces of alcohol around the cation (see Fig. 7) that there is significant polar as well as nonpolar interactions between the alcohol and the cation. The coordination number of alcohol around the cation is found to decrease with decrease in alcohol concentration (refer to Fig. 11). However, the rate of decrease of coordination number here is greater as compared to that of alcohol around the anion."
7,Tail-tail and nonpolar interactions,"3.5 Tail-tail and nonpolar interactions The composition dependent effects of alcohol addition on the nonpolar correlations among the cationic terminal carbon atoms (C22 and C9) and alcohol chain terminal carbon (C1) were investigated via corresponding RDFs, shown in Figs. 14 and S12 of the Supplementary material. Among all the RDFs, we observe that C22-C22 and C1-C22 always have an appreciable and higher correlation as compared to that between alcohol tail (C1) and C9 atom of the cation for both the mixtures, thus, making them more responsive towards the composition change. Fig. 14 (a)–(b) clearly show that as the IL mole fraction increases, cationic tail-tail close contact correlations are enhanced with respect to their bulk values. We also observe that increase in cationic tail-tail correlations are accompanied with increase in C1-C22 correlations as IL concentration increases."
8,Conclusions,"In this molecular dynamics study, a detailed analysis has been carried out on the structural aspects of Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + PrOH and Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − + BuOH mixtures over the entire range of composition. We have particularly emphasized on understanding the composition-dependent variation of hydrogen bonding interactions among different species in both the mixtures. A close inspection of the radial and spatial isodensity surfaces revealed existence of strong hydrogen bonding interaction between the alcohol molecules. It was also observed that the cation head and anion are predominantly present near the polar part of the alcohol. The interaction between the anion and alcohols is primarily governed by strong hydrogen bonding interactions that occurs through the oxygen atoms of the anion and hydroxyl hydrogen of the alcohol whereas, nonpolar interactions also persist between tails of alcohols and the cation. On the other hand, there is also an appreciable interaction between NTf 2 − and Im 1 , 4 + throughout the composition range. Moreover, on comparing all the correlations in the two mixtures studied, it was found that both PrOH and BuOH show similar trends with the IL Im 1 , 4 + / NTf 2 − concentration. For all the mole fractions of IL explored here, we conclude that while the polar part (hydroxyl group) of the alcohol remains towards the head of the cation as well as near the anion, its nonpolar tail is aligned with the cationic tail or with the alkyl tail of other alcohols. The X-ray scattering structure functions demonstrate that the long range charge ordering structure in the mixtures begins to build at x IL = 0.3 but at larger length scales. However, this ordering is virtually regained as in neat IL for x IL ≥ 0.8. Excess scattering at low q also reveals the presence of mesoscopic heterogeneity present in both the mixtures. However, experimental verification would lead to better comprehension of this phenomenon."
