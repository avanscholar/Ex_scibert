0,Introduction,"The progressive depletion of fossil fuels, along with its environmental impacts, has driven the scientific community to search for sustainable and renewable energy sources. The search has been compelled by the burgeoning global population at 0.9% annual rate, reaching over 9 billion by 2050, resulting to 29% increase in world energy consumption [1]. One of the highest energy-consuming sectors is transportation. In the U.S., 92% of transportation fuels are petroleum-derived, while only 5% are biofuels obtained from renewable sources [2]. Among transportation fuels, the development of bio-based jet fuels is of tremendous interest. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, an increase of approximately 45% in jet fuels consumption is expected by 2040 [2]. About 278 billion liters of jet fuels were consumed by commercial operators in 2016, leading to 781 million tons of CO2 emissions [3]. While other energy sources (e.g. electricity, fuel cells) are being investigated for road transportation, the aviation sector relies on liquid fuels with strict quality requirements to power gas-turbine engines [4]. These are kerosene-range hydrocarbons with C8–C16 carbon atoms. These hydrocarbons can be obtained from renewable sources such as triglycerides. Among the numerous fatty acid sources (mainly animal fats and vegetable oils), waste cooking oil (WCO) is particularly promising. Unlike virgin oils, WCO is not used in food applications and is also a cheaper feedstock. It is largely available in the U.S. and around the globe, with an annual global production of 29 million tons [5]. Moreover, WCO is already largely used in the U.S. for biodiesel production, so that a well-developed transportation and supply infrastructure already exists [6]. Several technologies have been investigated for the conversion of fatty acids into jet fuels [4,7]. These involve oxygen removal from the fatty acids via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) or decarboxylation/decarbonylation reactions using hydrogen. Depending on the nature of catalyst used, its support, and reaction conditions such as temperature and pressure, one reaction pathway can be favored over another [8]. Most commonly used catalysts are sulfided bimetallic materials such as Ni-Mo or Co-Mo, or noble metals like Pt or Pd [9]. Veriansyah et al. [10] investigated the hydroprocessing conversion of soybean oil on different supported catalysts, and found that the most efficient one was NiMo/γ–Al2O3. Clearly, the desired catalyst characteristics are high stability and low cost. For this reason, due to the high cost of noble metals, extensive effort has been directed towards the development of transition metals, and particularly Ni-based catalysts [11]. These catalysts have reached a mature level, and are already widely employed commercially for hydrodesulphurization (HDS) processes [8]. In particular, Hočevar and co-workers reported that the sulfided form appeared the most active compared to the oxide and reduced (metal) forms in the HDO of lignocellulosic derived compounds [12,13]. On the other hand, the catalyst support also plays a major role in the catalyst performances [14]. The hydrotreating process for biojet fuels production from triglyceride-based feedstock, known as hydroprocessed renewable jet (HRJ) or hydroprocessed esters of fatty acids (HEFA), is in fact a mature technology and has already been commercialized. For example, Honeywell’s UOP, in collaboration with ENI has successfully commercialized the Ecofining™ process that converts vegetable oils into green jet fuels by deoxygenation [7,15] as shown in Fig. 1 A. Accordingly, the distillate products are obtained from a series of two-reaction system with an intermediate separation of by-products. Various feedstock types, such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and greases, can be processed using the UOP-Eni Ecofining. The first reactor, the HDO reactor R1, is fed with the feedstock and hydrogen to produce n-alkanes [16,17]. The nature of the product is dictated by the feedstock’s fatty acid composition, catalyst type, and operating conditions. The by-products are separated from the n-alkanes in a flash drum, operated at the reaction pressure. The gaseous stream is a mixture of unreacted hydrogen, CO2, and CO. The liquid is an immiscible mixture of organic liquid and water. In the second reactor, the hydroisomerization/hydrocracking (HH) reactor R2, the liquid product is isomerized and cracked in the presence of hydrogen [7,15]. This step is necessary to obtain a kerosene boiling range and jet fuel requirements. Light fuels and residual diesel (if any), are the valuable by-products. The latter might be recycled to increase jet fuel production or directly sold to the market. Despite its maturity level, HRJ has drawbacks associated with the use of hydrogen gas. First, H2 is poorly miscible with oil at atmospheric conditions, thus, 25-100 bar pressure is required to enhance mass transfer. This results in high capital and operating costs. Second, storage and transportation of hydrogen increases cost and creates safety issues due to its high reactivity and flammability. Third, the production of hydrogen in refineries relies on fossil sources resulting into large CO2 emissions. This study addresses the three issues associated with HRJ by employing catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) as an alternative process to convert WCO into jet fuels (Fig. 1B.) [18]. CTH utilizes hydrogen-donating compounds that, in the presence of a catalyst, release H2 to saturate and reduce triglyceride compounds in oils. Suitable hydrogen-donor compounds typically contain hydrogen bonded to elements or groups with similar electronegativity to that of hydrogen itself. Therefore, organic acids, alcohols, amines, and hydrocarbons are suitable hydrogen donors in CTH [19]. Using hydrocarbons as in situ hydrogen donors gives the advantage that the bond energy of C-H is lower than that of the H-H bond in H2 [20]. However, most of these compounds are costly, toxic and volatile. The most available, less toxic and less expensive solvents are common alcohols (methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and isopropanol), which have been reported to be effective hydrogen donors [21]. Methanol has been used to hydrogenate styrene and nitrobenzene [22], while ethanol and 2-propanol were used to deoxygenate levulinic acid over 5% Pd/C [23]. Among these common alcohols, primary alcohols are generally less active than secondary alcohols. The improved hydrogenation ability of secondary alcohols has been attributed to the highest reduction potential of the corresponding ketones or the smaller electron-releasing inductive effect of one alkyl group compared to two alkyl groups [24]. For example, the two methyl groups in 2-propanol donate more electrons to weaken the O-H bond compared to the lower electron-donating ability of one methyl group and one ethyl group in methanol and ethanol, respectively. Despite the use of a variety of alcohols, isopropanol remains the most popular donor, because of its simplicity, cheapness, availability, and ease of removal from reaction systems. Therefore, based on the literature, our preliminary studies, and the possibility of generating this solvent from renewable feedstock, we proposed to use and compare the effectiveness of using isopropanol as in situ H2 source for jet fuels production from WCO. To the best of our knowledge, isopropanol has not been used for hydrogenation or deoxygenation of WCO. Hence, in this study, catalytic transfer hydrogenation of WCO to produce jet fuels was analyzed using isopropanol as an H-donor in a continuous-flow reactor over a fixed bed of activated carbon. The experimental study has been previously published by our group [18], proving that the process was effective in producing jet/diesel range fuels. With this work, we aimed at carrying out a detailed, process simulation-based techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life-cycle assessment (LCA) of the proposed CTH process at industrial-scale and compared its market and environmental performance with that of commercial HRJ process. The novelty of this work lies in the fact that CTH of WCO was performed at nearly atmospheric pressure conditions, which cannot be achieved using gaseous hydrogen. Moreover, detailed techno-economic and environmental performance data, which is limited in scientific literature for this novel process, were generated and reported."
1,Methods,"Process simulations of renewable jet fuels production from WCO by direct hydrogenation (HRJ via pressurized hydrogen) and CTH were performed using Aspen Plus® software v.9. The Peng-Robinson equation of state and the Non-Random Two-Liquid (NRTL) activity coefficient model were selected as thermodynamic methods. The former was selected as it is suitable to describe the behavior of hydrocarbon systems in high-pressure conditions, while NRTL was used to model specifically the low-pressure vapor-liquid-liquid equilibrium in the products separation following CTH reaction (see section 2.3). The goal of this study was to perform a comparative TEA and LCA (attributional) between HRJ and CTH process. For the TEA, a basis of 1000 ton/day WCO feedstock was employed because this represents the throughput of a small-to medium-scale refinery in the U.S [25]. The two processes were compared in terms of economic metrics (internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV)) and environmental impacts (cumulative fossil energy demand (CED) and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions). All the assumptions and methods used in the analysis are described in the succeeding sections. The TEA considered a WCO feed flow rate of 1000 ton/day and the LCA adapted a 1 MJ of useable energy produced embodied in liquid biojet fuel."
2,Waste cooking oil feedstock,"2.1 Waste cooking oil feedstock The fatty acids composition of the WCO feedstock considered is reported in Table 1 [18]. The number of unsaturated bonds in each fatty acid is specified after the length of the carbon chain. Roughly 70 wt% of the oil was composed of unsaturated fatty acids (oleic and linoleic acids), while the remaining compounds were saturated carbon chains. It should be noted that typical waste cooking oils are composed of 80–96 wt% triglycerides (TG), 2-7 wt% diglycerides (DG), 0.3–2 wt% monoglycerides (MG), and free fatty acids (FFA) contents from 1 to 16 wt% [26–29]."
3,Hydroprocessed renewable jet (HRJ) process,"2.2 Hydroprocessed renewable jet (HRJ) process The process flowsheet for the HRJ process was built in Aspen Plus, based on the UOP commercial process (Section 1) as shown in Fig. 2 . The corresponding material and energy balances resulting from the simulations are reported in Appendix A (Table A1). The WCO feed was pumped and heated up to the operating conditions of the HDO reactor R1 (HDOR1) together with H2, which was fed at 2.6 wt% ratio with respect to WCO [30]. The HDO unit was modelled as a stoichiometric reactor RStoich. For each saturated fatty acid, the stoichiometric reactions of decarboxylation, decarbonylation and hydrodeoxygenation were defined according to: (1) C n H 2 n O 2 → C n − 1 H 2 n + CO 2 (2) C n H 2 n O 2 + H 2 → C n − 1 H 2 n + CO + H 2 O (3) C n H 2 n O 2 + 3 H 2 → C n H 2 n + 2 + 2 H 2 O For the unsaturated fatty acids, additional hydrogen was consumed to hydrogenate the double bonds. The detailed stoichiometry is reported in Table S1. The operating conditions and fatty acids conversions for the three reactions were taken from the works of Chu et al. [30] and Veriansyah et al. [10], which analyzed the conversion of vegetable oil into fuels at 400 °C, 92 bar, and 2-h reaction time over nickel-molybdenum catalyst. Accordingly, the extent of reaction was set equal to 0.68 for decarboxylation, 0.03 for decarbonylation and 0.29 for hydrodeoxygenation, with overall oil conversion equal to 1. The hydrogen consumption associated with the cleavage of triglycerides backbone (3 mol of H2 for each triglyceride producing the corresponding free fatty acids) and the corresponding formation of 1 mol of propane was also considered (Table S4), according to the reaction pathway proposed by the same authors [10,30]. The gaseous products (CO, CO2, H2 and H2O) might give rise to Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Methanation reactions. However, Veriansyah et al. [10] reported that no methanation was observed over Ni-Mo catalyst under the experimental conditions investigated. To allow for possible WGS, a REquil reactor unit (WGS-HDO) was added to calculate the gas phase equilibrium reaction (Eq. (4)), which was evaluated at the same operating conditions (400 °C and 92 bar). (4) CO + H 2 O ↔ H 2 + CO 2 A high-pressure flash was used to separate the liquid and gaseous products, which were cooled to 40 °C, making the water and hydrocarbons completely immiscible. Hence, a 3-phase adiabatic flash (HIGH-P-F) was used to achieve complete separation of water, organic liquids, and gases (Table S6). The organic liquid products were then sent to a hydrocracking unit (HCC) that cracked and isomerized the paraffins to obtain the desired product mixture quality at 350 °C and 90 bar [31,32]. Because of the complexity of modelling hydrocracking reactions, the reactor was simulated with a RGibbs model, considering a total of 358 hydrocarbon components from the Aspen Plus database, including all isomers ranging from C1 to C18 carbon atoms. The validity of this approach was verified by checking the product yields (LPG, naphtha, kerosene and diesel ranges) with those reported in the literature [30,33–35]. The amount of H2 required for hydrocracking was evaluated based on the properties of the feed, namely °API gravity and Watson factor (Table S7), and was equal to 84.44 Nm3 of H2 per m3 of oil (Table S8) [35]. Hydrogen is typically fed in large excess to absorb the heat of reaction by direct quench at different stages of the reactor. Therefore, a higher amount of inert hydrogen is required in the reactor depending on the heat produced. The amount of hydrogen required for quench was estimated through an energy balance to keep the difference between inlet and outlet of reactor in the maximum range of 25 °C (assuming adiabatic operation). This amount of H2 was set as inert fraction in the RGibbs unit, so it was not accounted for in the equilibrium calculation. HCC process input parameters in Aspen Plus are shown in Table S9. The products from the HCC reactor were separated by means of two flash units in series. The first one operated at high pressure (HP-SEP) to recover the unreacted hydrogen, while the second one operated at low pressure (LP-SEP) to separate C1-C4 gaseous products from the liquid mixture, which was to be sent to an atmospheric fractionation tower to recover the different product fractions. The higher the operating pressure of the LP-SEP unit, the higher the recovery of liquid fuels (Table S14). However, it was preferred to operate the flash at 1 bar so that a higher amount of propane C3H8 (94%) was recovered in the gaseous stream, to be used as additional fuel. The liquid fuels mixture was then sent to an atmospheric fractionation tower (FRAC) to recover the different product fractions, i.e. naphtha and kerosene. Distillation was modelled as a RadFrac unit, operating with 30 ideal stages and reflux ratio of 0.8. The large excess of H2 recovered from the HIGH-P-F and HP-SEP flash units is valuable, so that high recovery from the gaseous streams was desired to maximize recycle. The gas mixture separated from the first flash unit was characterized by large amounts of CO and CO2, while the one recovered after the hydrocracking unit mostly comprises light hydrocarbons, such as CH4, C2H6 and C3H8. Industrially, the recovery of hydrogen is performed by Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA), with operating pressures varying between 10 and 40 bar [33,36]. As a higher recovery pressure results in lower compression loads required for H2 recycling, 40 bar was chosen for the simulations. For the purposes of the simulations, the PSA units were modelled by simple SEP blocks assuming complete H2 recovery. The H2 make-up stream was compressed up to 40 bars by means of a 3-stage compressor (C2, compression ratio = 3.14, which considered the final temperature of each stage, not exceeding 225 °C for H2), with inter-stage cooling at 40 °C. The make-up and recycled H2 streams were then mixed and compressed up to the final pressure of 92 bar in a second single-stage compressor (C1) and delivered to the HDO and HCC reactors respectively. Finally, pinch analysis was performed in order to optimize heat integration (Section 1.6 of SI). The optimized heat exchanger networks are displayed in the process flowsheet (Fig. 2), where integrated heat exchangers are connected by energy streams (dashed lines). Accordingly, the external process utilities needed consisted of a fired heater to achieve 400 °C prior to the HDO reactor, and cooling water to cool the products at 40 °C in the units CW1 and CW2. The column reboiler and condenser duties were also provided by external utilities."
4,Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) process,"2.3 Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) process The process flowsheet of the CTH process is shown in Fig. 3 , and the corresponding material/energy balances are reported in Appendix A (Table A2 ). The simulation was based on the block flow diagram of Fig. 1B and on the experimental data obtained in the laboratory using a fixed-bed tubular reactor filled with charcoal catalyst [18]. The WCO feedstock was mixed with isopropanol (ISO-P) at a flowrate of 341.8 ton/day (ISO-P/WCO ratio = 0.3418), and heated up to the CTH reactor operating temperature (380 °C), found to be the optimal value [18]. The CTH operating pressure was set to 2 bar, and the reaction was simulated using the RYield model. The product yields, defined as mass of product over inlet mass of reagents, were calculated based on the experimental material balance results (Table S24). The gaseous products considered were H2, H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H6 and C3H8, which were formed either by decarboxylation, decarbonylation, or hydrodeoxygenation reactions as well as by isopropanol decomposition. Concerning the liquid products, for the sake of simplicity, only three reference components were taken as representatives for the naphtha, kerosene and diesel range hydrocarbons, respectively. Based on the average properties (boiling point and molecular weight) of the experimental products distribution, C8H16, C12H26, and C17H36 were selected as the three respective liquid fuel fractions (Table S18-S23). Because the reaction leads to coke formation, catalyst regeneration was included by simulating the coke removal using a SEP unit. The composition of the outlet stream from CTH reactor was characterized by a mixture of hydrocarbons (C8H16, C12H26, C17H36), water (H2O) and gaseous products (CO2, CO, C1-C3). The separation of hydrocarbon mixture from gases and water could be achieved at low temperature, since the solubility of water is inversely dependent on temperature. Accordingly, a 3-phase flash model was used to simulate the required separation (VLL-SEP) at atmospheric pressure, after cooling the products to 25 °C. For a correct estimation of the vapor-liquid-liquid equilibrium at low pressure, NRTL was used as thermodynamic model. The solubility of the incondensable compounds (CO, CO2 and H2) was determined from the Henry constants, available in the Aspen Plus database. The validity of the binary interaction parameters of the H2O-hydrocarbon systems was first verified against experimental data (Table S26-S27). Finally, the three liquid fuels fractions were separated by means of two atmospheric distillation columns in series: the first one (FRAC1) separated the naphtha from the heavier fractions, which were then separated in the second one (FRAC2). The columns specifications were, respectively: 10 ideal stages and reflux ratio = 0.2 for the first separation; 15 ideal stages and reflux ratio = 0.2 for the second one. Heat integration was also carried out between the cold feed and the hot products, as shown by the energy stream (dashed line) in Fig. 3. By analyzing the vaporization range of the WCO-isopropanol feed, the feed outlet temperature from the integrated heat exchanger was set to 300 °C. As most of the WCO vaporizes in the range of 300–350 °C (Fig. S8), it was preferred to avoid the phase change within the heat exchanger, and to supply the latent heat duty by means of a fired heater. Accordingly, the external utilities were represented by the fired heater required to reach 380 °C and refrigerated cooling water (available at 5 °C) to cool down the products to 25 °C, in addition to the reboiler and condenser duties of the two distillation columns."
5,Techno-economic analysis,"2.4 Techno-economic analysis For a 1000 ton/day WCO feed flow rate (approximately 270,000 gal/day), the economic and profitability analysis of both HRJ and CTH processes were performed according to the method proposed by Towler et al. [37] for chemical plants. Accordingly, the Fixed Capital Investment (FCI) and the Cost of Manufacturing (COM) were estimated together with the revenues. The FCI consists of the capital expenses of the plant including construction and engineering costs (CAPEX), contingency charges, and offsite infrastructure investment (OSBL) (Section 5.1.1 of SI). The CAPEX were estimated based on the Bare Module Cost of each equipment unit, evaluated using the correlations proposed by Guthrie [38]. According to this method, the purchase cost of the equipment was calculated as a function of the size, as well as the construction material and the operating pressure, which become particularly relevant for the HRJ process, characterized by high pressures. Furthermore, the material chosen for HDO and HCC reactors were stainless steel (SS) because of hydrogen gas in compatibility with respect to the normal carbon steel (CS) [39]. Moreover, to account for inflation, all the costs were referred to the year 2017 using the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI) [40]. A rigorous sizing procedure was applied to determine the size of the HDO and HCC reactors for the HRJ process, and that of the CTH reactor. A Trickle Bed Reactor (TBR) composed of adiabatic multi-stage beds was selected as HDO reactor [41]. Considering the properties of the feed, catalyst hold-up of 60%, and liquid residence time of 2 h, the resulting reactor was determined to have 4 stages, each of diameter D = 3.048 m and H = 8.39 m, for a total volume of 245 m3 (Section 4.1.1 of SI). The HCC reactor was sized as a multi-stage packed bed reactor, such as those used at commercial level. Taking a typical gas residence time of 1 h, the reactor volume equaled 392.5 m3, with 5 stages of D = 3.81 m and H = 6.9 m [42] (Section 4.1.2 of SI). Finally, a packed bed reactor was selected also for the CTH reactor. The scale-up was based on the experimental value of the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 6.8 h−1. The resulting volume, assuming 60% catalyst hold-up, was equal to 27.4 m3 (Section 4.2.1 of SI). Given the high coke formation, 2 parallel reactors were considered, in order to allow a continuous operation when performing catalyst regeneration. The sieved tray distillation columns were sized according to the Fair Method [43]. In particular, the distillation tower of the HRJ process resulted having a diameter D = 1.8 m and H = 15.7 m, which allowed operating at 74% of the flooding condition. The diameters and the heights of columns of the CTH process were H = 17.5 m, D = 1.35 m and H = 17.5 m, D = 1.7 m, respectively (approximately 78% of the flooding). In addition, the capital cost related to building an internal H2 production facility by Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) was considered for the HRJ process [37]. The capital cost of the PSA unit was instead determined using a capacity factor with respect to a similar reference unit [36]. According to the simplified procedure employed, the OSBL were estimated as 50% of the total CAPEX (with reference to atmospheric pressure purchase costs), while contingencies amount to 15% of the actual CAPEX [37]. The COM considers both direct and indirect manufacturing costs, as well as general expenses related to business administration. Direct manufacturing costs are directly correlated with the production rate and comprise raw materials and utilities or operations expenses (OPEX), as well as staff and operating labor. The OPEX were evaluated based on the results of the process simulations. For the estimation of natural gas utility in the fired heater unit, an efficiency of 80% of the thermal system was assumed. Moreover, the utility used for cooling the CTH reactor was hot oil or molten salts due to the high operating temperature, i.e. 380 °C. The price of this utility was estimated based on the reference for Hot Oil/Molten Salts for reactor cooling [44]. More specifically, the cost was based on the price of natural gas that would be required to heat the hot oil/molten salts. The number of operators was calculated based on the number of equipment units and was equal to 29 for the HRJ and 26 for the CTH processes. Indirect manufacturing costs and general expenses were instead estimated as percentages of the FCI [35,37]. The plant was assumed to operate for 8000 h/year, i.e. a stream factor of 0.913 was applied. The economic profitability of the processes was evaluated by means of discounted cash flow analysis, according to four criteria: discounted payback period (DPBP), net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and present value ratio (PVR). The following additional assumptions were made [45]: first, the useful life of the plant was taken equal to 25 years, the first 2 of which were used for construction and start-up, while full regime production started at year 3. In particular, 70% of the capital was invested at year 1, while the remaining 30% in year 2. Second, the discount rate was taken as an interest rate of 8%, hence, it is not based on loan interests or debt ratio. Third, depreciation was evaluated according to the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS). The depreciation period was 7 years, starting at the beginning of the 3rd and ending at the end of the 10th year. In particular, the double declining balance was applied for the first 5 years after the plant start-up, after which it was switched to the straight-line method. No salvage value of the plant was assumed. Thus, the total capital to be depreciated equaled the fixed capital investment (FCI). Fourth, the income tax rate was assumed to be 35% of the gross profit. Fifth, the cost of the land was not considered, as it was not relevant for the sake of comparison between the profitability of the two processes. Finally, annual operators’ salary was taken from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics [33]. The revenues were evaluated based on the wholesale prices of the refinery products, which included the production costs and refiner profit, while distribution and transportation costs and taxes were not considered. The wholesale prices corresponding to the different refinery products (naphtha, kerosene, and diesel) were retrieved from the U.S. Energy Information and Administration [46], and were equal to 0.426 $/L, 0.443 $/L, and 0.440 $/L, respectively, as average prices for 2017. The large amount of fuel gases produced by both the HRJ and CTH process was assumed to be sold at the same price as natural gas (0.13 $/m3), considering that the lower heating value (LHV) of these gases was very similar to that of natural gas."
6,Life cycle assessment,"2.5 Life cycle assessment 2.5.1 Goal and scope The comparative environmental impacts of HRJ and CTH processes using WCO as feedstock were evaluated in terms of CED and life cycle GHG emissions. It was assumed that one biorefinery was located in any medium-sized U.S. city (population: 100,000–300,000 persons) [47]. A biorefinery serves one division for each U.S. region (e.g. one biorefinery for Division 2 [Mid-Atlantic] of Region 1 [Northeast], which includes New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania). WCO was assumed to be collected from restaurants, hotels, casinos, malls, and other food providers operating in these cities. The volume of WCO generated from household sources was insignificant relative to the food service industry; restaurants still dominate total spent oil output. These cities are ideal test locations for a WCO-based refinery for the following reasons. First, they are affordable, offering abundant opportunities for business investments. Second, these cities have numerous restaurants that can provide appreciable amount of WCO. They have high average number of restaurants per 1000 people compared to the national average of 1.52 for cities whose population is greater than 50,000 [48]. Third, these cities are not as busy as megacities which cuts transportation costs yet were assumed to be located within 150-mile maximum radius from a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) (>1 million population) to ensure reliable supply of spent oil. Examples of these medium-sized U.S. cities are Pittsburgh (2019 population: 302, 908) serving Division 2, Region 1; Greensboro, North Carolina (2019 population: 292,265) serving Division 5, Region 3; or Fremont, California (2019 population: 238, 281) serving Division 9, Region 4 [36]. Based on the 270,000 gal/day (98.55 Mgal/year continuous operation) TEA basis, the nine biorefineries in the U.S. will require 8.87 × 108 gal/yr. The U.S. generates more than enough WCO at 3.8 Mton WCO annually (9.92 × 1011 gal/yr) [49], with 2.84 Mton yellow and other grease [50]. The system boundary for the analysis was “well-to-tank” (WTT), in which all associated energy and material flows were determined and quantified for each unit operation: hydrogenation/hydrocracking/separation for HRJ and hydrogenation/separation for CTH. Fuel combustion was excluded in the analysis. The WTT system boundary starts with the acquisition of all raw materials up to distribution of products to end-users (e.g. airports). For ease of analysis, HRJ was modelled as the base case using the UOP-Eni Ecofining™ process. CTH was considered as the alternative case. 2.5.2 Functional unit The functional unit (FU) chosen for this analysis was 1 MJ/year embodied energy in liquid biojet fuel (main product) produced from either HRJ or CTH process using WCO as feedstock. Such FU is conveniently adapted to provide a quantitative reference on which all calculated materials and energy flows were based. Co-products were light fuels and naphtha from HRJ and naphtha and diesel from CTH. 2.5.3 System boundary The HRJ process was divided into eight sub-systems which include WCO transport (WT), hydrodeoxygenation (HY), CO and CO2 flash separation (FS), hydroisomerization and hydrocracking (HH), high pressure flash (HF), low pressure flash (LF), distillation (DT), and fuel transport (FT). Fig. 1A represents hydrotreating as HY, separation as FS, hydrocracking as HH, and products recovery as HF, LF, and DT. In the case of CTH, there were six sub-systems identified: WCO transport (WT), catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CH), low pressure flash (LF), distillation 1 (DT1), distillation 2 (DT2), and fuel transport (FT). These sub-systems are represented in Fig. 1B as: hydrogenation for CH, and separation for LF, and products recovery for DT1 and DT2. Both HRJ and CTH have identical WT and FT sub-systems. HRJ Sub-System 1: Waste Cooking Oil Transport (WT). This sub-system involved the systematic collection of WCO from restaurants and food service businesses in cities where a biorefinery was to be established. Additional WCO were to be collected from MSA located within 150-mile maximum radius of the biorefinery to meet the 1000 ton/day biorefinery requirement used in TEA (approximately 270,000 gallons/day WCO). WCO were transported from sources near the biorefinery or from MSAs using diesel trucks with likeliest truck mileage efficiency of 6.5 miles/gallon [51]. Diesel Class 8 heavy trucks were assumed to travel for 6 h in a day at 50 miles/hr. Material input to WT was transportation diesel while material outputs were combustion products CO2 and H2O. Maximum travel distance per truck was 300 miles and the mileage efficiency was taken to be 5.5 miles/gal [52]. HRJ Sub-System 2: Hydrodeoxygenation (HY). WCO entered the biorefinery as pretreated spent oil suitable for processing. Depending upon the nature of fatty acids, conversion can be decarboxylation, decarbonylation, or hydrodeoxygenation (Table S1). HY is adapted as general term for hydrotreatment. The chemical reaction was operated at the following conditions: 400 °C, 9.2 MPa and 2 h of residence time [14,15]. A four-stage HY unit was utilized in this sub-system. Material inputs included pretreated crude oil, H2 as hydrogenating agent, and nickel-molybdenum (NiMo) catalyst. The output from HY was a mixture of straight-chain alkanes consisting of tetradecane, pentadecane, heptadecane, and nonadecane. Moreover, gases such as CO, CO2, and propane were generated in addition to water. The amount of total H2 required and propane generated were based on stoichiometry presented in Table S4. The energy consumption for HY was attributed to: (1) pressurization assuming isentropic compression of H2 at 85% efficiency and (2) WCO pumping at 95% efficiency. Heat was utilized to raise the oil temperature from 380 to 400 °C, determined as the heat duty to be supplied resulting from heat integration. HRJ Sub-System 3: CO and CO 2 Flash Separation (FS). Flash separation was performed to separate the gaseous by-products from the output liquid straight chain alkanes. Separation input parameters for FS were as follows: 9.2. MPa, 10 min liquid hold-up [23], adiabatic operation, and vapor-liquid-dirt water phases, employing the Peng-Robinson property method in Aspen Plus modeling. A single vertical-type separation vessel was used. These gases include CO, CO2, water vapor, propane, and H2. Along with liquid alkanes, sour water was generated. Energy requirement for this sub-system was attributed to the lowering of product temperature from 231 to 40 °C (after heat integration). HRJ Sub-System 4: Hydroisomerization and Hydrocracking (HH). The separated liquid straight chain alkanes were isomerized/cracked to get smaller chains of iso-paraffines. Mild conditions were employed in this sub-system: 350 °C and 9.0 MPa at 1-h HH reaction time. Detailed process input parameters used in Aspen Plus modeling are tabulated in Table S9. The hydroisomerization and hydrocracking unit comprised 5 stages. Properties of feed oil and hydrogen are presented in Table S7 and Table S8, respectively. Material inputs to this sub-system include the alkanes, H2 for isomerization and cracking, and H2 for quenching. Output isoparaffins include N-paraffins (C1-C3, C4-C8, C9-C15, C16-C18) and their methylated counterparts (mono-x-methyl and mono-yy-methyl) (naphtha, jet fuel, and diesel). The compression energy was already accounted for in the HH unit. All input H2 was previously compressed and then split into the two reactors thereby making pressurization energy of this unit to be 0. Direct heat use was also 0, due to heat integration (See Section 1.5 of SI). The heat to reach the operating temperature was recovered from other streams. HRJ Sub-System 5: High Pressure Flash (HF). High-pressure flash was employed to recover H2 and other gaseous compounds from the liquid products. Herein, the process conditions were: 9 MPa, 10-min liquid hold-up, and no heat duty (adiabatic operation, temperature after cooling was stable at 40 °C). There was one vertical-type HF vessel used. Two material streams were produced in this sub-system: (1) the gaseous stream consisting of the recovered H2, CO, CO2, N-paraffins, and methylated paraffins, and (2) the liquid stream consisting of naphtha, jet fuel, and diesel. There were residual H2, CO, and CO2 present in the output liquid. Like sub-system FS, the energy requirement was cooling energy use, or the latent heat expelled to lower the product temperature from 196 to 40 °C (after heat integration) (exothermic). HRJ Sub-System 6: Low Pressure Flash (LF). Atmospheric sub-system LF was employed following HF to separate light hydrocarbons to be used as fuel gas and residual H2, CO, and CO2 from the liquid fraction in a horizontal vessel. Process conditions for this sub-system were: 0.10 MPa, 10-min liquid hold-up, and no heat duty (temperature was stable at 24 °C). The output liquid was heavy with biojet fuel, diesel, and naphtha with very little CO2 left. There was no cooling energy requirement for this sub-system. HRJ Sub-System 7: Distillation (DT). Final stage of product recovery was atmospheric distillation, to separate the liquid fractions naphtha (C6-C8) from the top and jet fuels (C9-C15) from the bottom. DT process conditions were as follows: 0.10 MPa, 30 stages, feed input at the 15th stage, 0.80 reflux ratio, 164.8 °C reboiler temperature, and 65.30 °C condenser temperature. Reflux ratio was optimized by sensitivity analysis to maximize the recovery of N-octane (light-key component) in the distillate. The output distillate (naphtha) was heavy in mono-x-methyl (C5-C8) (44 wt%) while the output residue (biojet fuels) was predominantly mono-x-methyl (C9-C15) (38 wt%) and multi-yy-methyl (C9-C15) (57 wt%). The energy use for this sub-system came from two sources: the heating duty at the reboiler and cooling energy at the condenser, both were function of WCO feed rate. HRJ Sub-System 8: Fuel Transport (FT). Like WT, FT utilized diesel to transport naphtha and biojet fuel to distribution endpoints (i.e. gate). Designated fuel distributors were assumed to be located within 150-mile maximum of WCO collection. The trucks were assumed to have a mileage efficiency of 6.5 miles/gallon. The distance hauled was calculated to be 300 miles/truck-day at 6 h per truck per day at 50 miles/hr. Material input to FT was diesel and material outputs were CO2 and H2O. CTH Sub-System 1: Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation (CH). CH was modelled based on the experimental work of Asiedu et al. [18]. Hydrogenation and deoxygenation of WCO was accomplished by means of a hydrogen donor solvent. Herein, gaseous H2 was replaced by isopropanol. Details on lab-scale reactor geometry and catalyst properties are presented in Table S16 and experimental conversion at different temperatures are shown in Table S17. From these results, an industrial model was built based on scale-up of experimental reactor and CH reactor material balance at T = 380 °C presented in Fig. S5. The reaction conditions for CH sub-system were as follows: 380 °C, 2 bar, 6.8 h−1 weight hourly space velocity in a continuous fixed-bed plug-flow reactor (PFR). There were 2 PFRs, each with a total capacity of 27.4 m3, to be operated alternately while the other undergoes catalyst regeneration. Activated carbon catalyst was assumed to be replaced every 90 days. Material input streams consisted of WCO, isopropanol as hydrogenating agent. The main liquid fuel product contained C1-C3 gases, naphtha, diesel (heptadecane), and biojet fuels. Gases were also generated in the reaction: CO, CO2, and H2, in addition to water and coke. Energy was utilized to pressurize WCO and 2-propoanol to 2 bar and heat was used to raise the feed’s temperature from 300 to 380 °C after heat integration. CTH Sub-System 2: Low Pressure Flash (LP). Like HRJ, output liquid from the main chemical reaction (CH) was subjected to LP to separate gases from main products (naphtha, diesel, biojet fuels). However, unlike HRJ, CTH has three output streams: gas (mainly CO and CO2), organic liquid (main products), and aqueous liquid (water and residual main products). Conditions were like HRJ’s sub-system LF, albeit condition was exothermic; heat was expelled from the system to cool the reaction products from 50 to 25 °C. The cooling down to 50 °C was achieved by heat integration. CTH Sub-System 3: Distillation 1 (DT1) and Distillation 2 (DT2). Products recovery involved a series of successive distillations DT1 and DT2, each employing one column. In DT1, naphtha (C6-C8) was recovered from the top, while the heavier fuels (C9-C18) were separated from the residue. The residue was further distilled in DT2 to extract jet fuels as distillate and diesel from the bottom. Process conditions for DT1 were: 0.10 MPa, 10 stages, feed input at the 3rd stage, 0.20 reflux ratio, 220 °C reboiler temperature, and 130 °C condenser temperature. Process conditions for DT2 were: 0.10 MPa, 15 stages, feed input at the 9th stage, 0.20 reflux ratio, 299 °C reboiler temperature, and 212 °C condenser temperature. For both distillation columns, heat was applied to the reboilers and heat was removed from the condensers. 2.5.4 Allocation Allocation is a critical step in LCA as it directly affects results of impacts assessment. Allocation involves the partitioning of the environmental impacts from the process based on products (materials output) flows [53]. Allocation is not a straightforward division of environmental impacts between products and co-products, thus, protocols set forth by ISO 14044:2006 guidelines [54] were adapted. For this analysis, mass-, energy- and market-based allocation methods were necessary. In both HRJ and CTH, the products were identified as naphtha/gasoline (C4-C8, e.g. octane C8H18) and jet fuels (C9-C15, e.g. dodecane C12H26) obtained at the very last sub-system (distillation). In some intermediate sub-systems, co-products were generated. For example, the sub-system HF in HRJ produced output liquid (gasoline and jet fuel mixture) that fed into subsequent LF sub-system. Concurrently, it also generated a co-product output gas mixture consisting of short-chain N-paraffins C1-C3 (e.g. ethane, propane), short-chain N-paraffins C4-C8 (e.g. butane, octane), and mono-x-methyl or multi-yy-methyl C9-C15 (e.g. dodecane, hexadecane or cetane), which can be pressurized and distilled into LPG, naphtha, and jet fuel, respectively. In the case of HRJ, the co-products were as follows: FS = propane; HF = [C1-C3, C4-C8, C9-C15] gaseous hydrocarbons; LF = [C1-C3, C4-C8, C9-C15] gaseous hydrocarbons, [C1-C3 (LPG), C16-C18 (diesel)] liquid hydrocarbons, and liquid CO2. For CTH, the co-products were as follows: CH = coke; LF = [C1-C3, octane, dodecane, heptadecane] gaseous hydrocarbons, and [C1-C3] (LPG) liquid hydrocarbons. Table 2 details the energy- and market-based allocation factors for HRJ and CTH processes. Thus, the CED and life cycle GHG emissions for each process were apportioned between products and co-products using mass flows, lower heating values, and unit selling price at prevailing market conditions. 2.5.5 Inventory Life cycle inventory (LCI) is the most tedious process in LCA as it involves the acquisition of high-quality data essential to accurate environmental impacts assessment. The development of HRJ and CTH models in this study entailed data from various sources and methods. The models were created and developed using Excel spreadsheet with Crystal Ball™ add-in functionality. This allows certain material inputs and process conditions to contain probability distributions (Table S70) that were subsequently used stochastically for the Monte Carlo simulation, resulting into probabilistic outputs (“endpoints”). The upstream impacts of electricity and selected materials were calculated using U.S. equivalency factors (or European where U.S. values were not available) presented in Table 3 . The hydrodeoxygenation LCI were largely based on the experimental results of Veriansyah et al. [10], appropriately scaled-up to 1000 tons/day FU. Gaseous H2 was stoichiometrically supplied to crude WCO using with nickel-molybdenum (NiMo) catalyst. The electrical energy for pressurization was determined from Aspen, assuming isentropic compression with H2 (85% efficiency) and continuous pumping of WCO (95% efficiency). LCI data for the rest of the sub-systems were obtained from various literature sources and detailed technical descriptions were reported in Section 1 of SI. Electrical energy for pressurization, heat, and material flows were determined from Aspen modeling. Compressed hydrogen gas was supplied as make-up contribution because part of the non-reacted H2 is recovered and recycled. As for CTH, large-scale LCI were based on the experimental study by Asiedu et al. [18]. Specifically, isopropanol was supplied in large quantity (341.8 tons/day) following scale-up of CTH reaction of WCO at different temperatures (Section 2.1 of SI). The electrical energy was applied to the pump to pressurize the WCO and isopropanol to 2 bar. The heat needed to increase the feed’s temperature from 300 to 380 °C was calculated by Aspen’s heat integration. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation output to succeeding sub-systems were based on experimental yields by Asiedu and colleagues. Detailed technical information for CTH LCI data were outlined in Section 2 of SI. Section 3 of SI provides Aspen simulation. A full accounting of energy/materials inputs/outputs is presented in Table 4 ."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Process performance,"3.1 Process performance The results of process simulation for HRJ and CTH systems are summarized in Table 5 . Aspen simulation resulted in an overall HRJ hydrogen consumption of 35.2 ton/day, of which 22.93 ton/day were consumed in the HY reactor (at hydrogen conversion of 88.2%), 11.34 ton/day in the hydrocracking unit, and 0.93 ton/day lost in the light gas stream separated by the low-pressure flash. Hydrogen was assumed to be completely recycled without any losses, although in practice these may vary between 15 and 25% for PSA unit. Hence, the amount of hydrogen consumed would be slightly larger than indicated. The overall hydrogen-to-WCO ratio of 3.5% w/w is similar to the ones calculated by Chu et al. (2.6–3% w/w), Han et al. (2-3% w/w), and Pearlson et al. (4% w/w) [30,33,45]. Nevertheless, Chu et al. did not consider the amount of hydrogen used for hydrocracking reactions assuming it as a factor of the degree of cracking instead. Pearlson et al. proposed that 4% w/w overall process ratio is appropriate for maximum jet fuel production based on literature data. The consumption of isopropanol in CTH is equal to its supply (341.8 ton/day), since it was completely decomposed inside the reactor and hence, non-recyclable. CTH’s isopropanol use is equal to 45.5 ton/day H2 consumption equivalent. Normalized on per ton biojet fuel produced, HRJ consumes 1.4 ton H2 while CTH utilizes 2.4 ton H2. On a per ton WCO consumed, HRJ uses 0.035 tons H2 while CTH utilizes 0.045 ton H2. The yield of liquid fuel products obtained from both systems were similar, comparable to previous studies [10,30,33,45] (77 wt% for HRJ and 76 wt% for CTH). The liquid mixture obtained from the conventional HRJ system were characterized by a larger amount of kerosene products, roughly 16% higher than that obtained from CTH. However, CTH produced more naphtha and diesel than HRJ. Both systems produced gaseous by-products. Specifically, about 10% of the WCO feed was converted into light gas (mostly propane) in HRJ, comparable to what is reported in other studies, ranging between 7% and 10% [30,33,45]. This light gas had low LHV because it contained large amount of CO and CO2. The CTH system produced around 162 ton/day of fuel gas with LHV of 21.2 MJ/kg. The thermal and electricity comparison between the two systems reflected their relative process conditions: temperature and pressure. The thermal energy (heat) consumptions were comparable between the two systems (513 GJ/day for HRJ, 485 GJ/day for CTH), due to the optimized heat integration network and the similar operating temperatures. CTH’s cooling energy requirement was 59% lower than HRJ’s due to the latter’s combined exothermic effect via flash separation and high-pressure flash. In terms of direct electricity, HRJ consumed more than four times electricity than CTH because of its high operating pressure and the handling of gaseous hydrogen via multi-stage compressors. CTH utilized low electricity because it operates at relatively low pressure and pumps were employed in place of compressors to transport liquid streams. In general, CTH consumed far less heat and electricity than HRJ because the number of pieces of equipment necessary in an HRJ reaction was much larger (two reaction systems: HY and HH), whereas only one reactor is used in CTH. Further, CTH does not require large recycle of gaseous streams, which is beneficial in reactor sizing and operation."
9,Capital expenditure,"3.2 Capital expenditure The results of CAPEX and FCI for both HRJ and CTH systems are summarized in Table 6 and Table 7 , respectively. A summary of direct manufacturing costs for both systems are reported in Table 8 . Moreover, the results of COM for HRJ and CTH systems are shown in Table 9 and Table 10 , respectively using direct, fixed, and general costs of manufacturing data (Table S58 and Table S59). In both CTH and HRJ systems, CAPEX was controlled by their main reaction sub-systems: 91% in HRJ and 45% in CTH, calculated in reference to the bare module cost assuming a factor of 4.74 to fluid process as single Lang factor, Cbm [22]. It is worth noting that the great difference in the capital costs of reactors between HRJ and CTH in Table 6 is due to a few factors. First factor is reactor volume. HDO and HCC reactors in HRJ operate with a large excess of gaseous H2, resulting in a much larger (about 10 times) reactor volume compared to CTH. Second factor is catalyst price. While conventional hydrotreating processes employ metal-based catalysts (Ni-Mo), CTH uses a sensibly cheaper catalyst that is made of activated carbon. Third factor is operating conditions. HRJ operates at a pressure of 92 and 90 bars for HDO and HCC, respectively, compared to 2 bars for CTH. High pressures require high quality and costly stainless steel as construction material, which increases the Cbm of HDO and HCC by about 25 times relative to the base value. The heating component in CTH’s main reactor costs over 3 M$, about 2% the cost of the heating component in HRJ’s main reactor. CTH required pumping, as the solvent was isopropanol while HRJ required compression, as the source was gaseous hydrogen. Gas compression is prohibitively expensive, in the order of M$. Both systems needed infrastructure for separation, although CTH demanded a single low-pressure separator while HRJ required multiple high- and low-pressure separators including a PSA hydrogen recovery unit. The breakdown of CAPEX for HRJ and CTH systems are shown in Fig. 4 (top panel), respectively. The total cost of CTH plant (7.3 M$) was significantly lower (around 98%) than the total cost of HRJ plant ($149.7 M$). This was mainly due to the high operating pressure in HRJ, which increased the bare module cost by about 10 times relative to atmospheric conditions. Together, the cost of HY and HH reactors in HRJ represented more than three-fourths of the 2017 total CAPEX or 64% of FCI. This large contribution was attributed to the slow reactions that unavoidably resulted in large reactor volumes and critical operating conditions. The SMR plant for hydrogen production substantially contributed to the overall capital investment, about 11%. Fractionation in both HRJ and CTH systems operated atmospherically. HRJ’s single fractionation column had a negligible contribution to total CAPEX (<1%). But unlike HRJ, the CTH system consisted of two fractionation columns in series, thereby doubling the cost of distillation. The contribution of these two columns to the total CAPEX was 12%. The CTH main reactor was comparably priced relative to other units, thanks to the low cost of the catalyst employed. In terms of heat exchange, CTH has one integrated heat exchanger, one cooling unit, and one fired-heating element as opposed to HRJ’s four integrated heat exchangers, two cooling units, and one fired-heating element. The FCI of the two systems, accounting for the offsite and contingency contributions, are 184.3 M$ and 12.1 M$ for HRJ and CTH system, respectively (Table 7). The direct manufacturing costs in HRJ and CTH as summarized in Table 8 demonstrated that on a per kg basis, isopropanol and hydrogen’s unit costs were relatively similar. However, when mass flow rates and hours of operation are factored in, the total annual cost of isopropanol ballooned to 148.11 M$, in comparison to hydrogen’s 18.77 M$, regardless of hydrogen’s compression requirement. In fact, isopropanol’s cost represented 67.8% of CTH’s total COM (without depreciation, Table 10). Table 9, on the other hand, shows that the driver in HRJ’s total COM is WCO, not hydrogen. Hydrogen compression was another significant driver, in conjunction with the cost associated with heating the single reboiler in the HRJ system."
10,Operations expenditure,"3.3 Operations expenditure The breakdown of total OPEX (raw materials, utilities) for the two systems are shown in Fig. 4 (bottom panel). It is worth noting that OPEX for HRJ amounted to 73 M$/year, while OPEX for CTH amounted to 203 M$/year. This huge difference was determined by the cost of isopropanol (148 M$/year), around 68% of CTH’s total operating cost (COM without depreciation). In general, the feedstock supply represented the major input to both systems. The overall COM, accounting for operating labor, fixed cost of manufacturing, and general expenses, amounted to 102 M$/year and 218 M$/year for HRJ and CTH system, respectively. In terms of revenue, the two systems were very similar, i.e. 150.8 M$/year for HRJ and 153.9 M$/year for CTH (Table 11 ). By comparing the revenues with the total COM, CTH generates a negative gross profit, with most of the income offset by the cost of supplying isopropanol."
11,Break-even analysis,"3.4 Break-even analysis Break-even analysis was performed to ascertain the profitability of CTH and HRJ systems using total CAPEX (CTH = $7.3M, HRJ = $149.7M), annual total COM (without depreciation) (CTH = $218.4M, HRJ = $102.2M), revenues from liquid fuel (CTH = $140.4M, HRJ = $141.4M), revenues from gaseous fuel (CTH = $13.5M, HRJ = $9.4M), and depreciation (use MACRS for 7 years). With these inputs, the net present value (NPV) for both processes under 10-year debt financing term was evaluated (CTH = −$216.6M, HRJ = $6.4M). To ascertain how NPV is sensitive to cost inputs (i.e. feedstock and products prices), these were varied by ±10% with respect to the base case values. The overall results are reported in Table 12 , while Fig. 5 shows the impact of each single factor on the NPV of HRJ and CTH processes, respectively. From the latter, it is shown how jet fuel price plays an important role in both processes, while the cost of isopropanol is the most impacting factor in CTH. Thereafter, the break-even point (i.e. time in years at NPV = 0) for the 10-year term was calculated for both systems by setting the NPV = 0 and generating a new annual cumulative NPV profile (0-25 years) with year 10 as the break-even point. This method was repeated for other break-even points: 5, 15, 20, and 25 years for both CTH and HRJ systems. The results are plotted in Fig. 6 . The 25-year NPV profiles of CTH (left) and HRJ (right) systems reveal the general trend in cumulative NPV across all financing terms. The initial dip in NPV from 0 to 2 years indicates the M$ initial investment. Seventy percent of the initial investment was spent on the first year and the remaining 30% on the second year. At year 2, the profile vertically dips even further with magnitude corresponding to the working capital. From 2 years onward, the profile increases until it hits the break-even point. Thus, DPBP coincides from year 2 to break-even point. This discounted cash flow analysis revealed that the cumulative cash flow became positive passed the break-even point. Depreciation was factored in from year 4 to year 11, and the tail end of the profile shows the NPV of each system at the end of its life. For example, CTH’s end-of-life NPVs were as follows: 35.29 M$, 8.01 M$, 3.05 M$, 1.04 M$, and 0 M$ for financing term of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 years, respectively. In both CTH and HRJ systems, the salvage value of the project decreases as the financing term increases. Negative cumulative NPV indicates that any system is deemed unprofitable while positive cumulative NPV indicates otherwise. For a system to be viable using the break-even analysis, one must understand that the current cumulative NPV at year n is a function of revenue, total COM, and depreciation at that year, including the initial investment. The break-even point is the time when annual revenue equals total business costs (total COM, depreciation) progressively achieved by paying a fraction of the initial investment year after year. Typically, the break-even point in most economic analyses determines the amount or volume of product sales in a year that equals total dollar sales to total dollar COM (i.e. gross profit = $0). In this analysis, however, the break-even point was calculated as the year beyond which total dollar sales exceeds total dollar COM, coinciding with cumulative NPV>$0. There was no set break-even point for which a business model ensures profitability; however, if total COM is higher than expected total sales, the business plan can be re-examined, and alternative strategies must be implemented. This study determined that selling the biojet fuel at $2.99/gal ($0.79/L) and $1.32/gal ($0.35/L) for CTH and HRJ, respectively, would take 25 years to break even. Since most corporations prefer break-even points to be less than 10 years, it would, therefore, be profitable to sell biojet fuel at $3.00/gal ($0.79/L) and $1.67/gal ($0.44/L) for CTH and HRJ, respectively. At these rates and for a project life of 25 years, the NPV for CTH and HRJ were estimated to be 8 M$ and 121 M$, respectively. It was observed that the biojet fuel selling price for the CTH system is higher than that of HRJ due the higher operation cost associated with CTH. However, as the break-even point approaches 5 years, the biojet fuel selling price for HRJ ($2.70/gal) and that for CTH ($3.10/gal) converges (12.94% difference) such that in the long run, CTH fuel would be affordable as a result of its low total CAPEX. It appears that CTH would recover its initial investment faster than HRJ through faster payment of its CAPEX. As capital recovery within 5 years appears ambitious, maintaining DPBP (8 years after the construction) and an interest rate of 8% for both processes would be ideal. An IRR analysis was performed for both CTH and HRJ systems covering interest rates from 1 to 50% for the entire 25-year life. The inputs to this analysis were base case inputs, that is, CTH-NPV was negative and HRJ-NPV was positive at the end of 25 years under a 10-year financing term. The results are presented in Fig. 7 . The IRR is an index of the investment risk, a method used in capital budgeting to estimate the profitability of investments. It refers to the discount rate that makes NPV of all cash flows equal to 0. IRR calculations followed the same method as NPV. As the interest rate increased, HRJ-NPV decreased while CTH-NPV increased. Since HRJ-based biojet fuel production is a mature technology with low risk, its IRR of 15.91% represents an attractive value for the investment. As of current market without any subsidies, incentives, or any of the investigated case scenarios from Table S68, CTH’s IRR profile seem to suggest that the system is untenable. At the present state, the CTH process based on experimental conditions investigated has potential to be economically profitable despite large input cost associated with isopropanol. Given that isopropanol cost represents 68% of CTH’s total COM, total COM must be reduced by around 30% to even start realizing net profit. This can be done using a combination of two strategies: (1) reduce both isopropanol cost and total direct/fixed/general cost by 60%, (2) reduce isopropanol cost by 55%. It is highly unlikely that a 60% reduction in staff salaries, plant overhead, and distribution/selling costs will be achieved because these variables are set by prevailing market conditions and for an emerging technology such as CTH-based biojet fuel, these costs will be slightly elevated, leaving the latter option to be realistically feasible. It was calculated that to obtain the same Present Value Ratio of HRJ (a more meaningful index than the NPV when two processes with very different capital investments are compared), the price of the isopropanol should not exceed 0.735 $ kg−1 (i.e. a 43.5% reduction from current cost) (Table S68). Alternatively, at the current market price, the maximum isopropanol inlet was calculated to be 196.54 ton/day (isopropanol/WCO feed ratio of 0.204 by weight) to be profitable. However, performances and product yields should be verified in this scenario."
12,Environmental metrics,"3.5 Environmental metrics The results of the inventory analysis described in Section 2.5.5 was used in life cycle impacts assessment, a step in LCA that quantifies environmental impacts, selects priorities from these environmental impacts, and transforms these priorities into meaningful environmental endpoint (damage category or forecast). In his study, two major environmental endpoints were identified: CED and life cycle greenhouse gas GHG emissions using the Eco-Indicator 99 method [67] and the equivalency factors (damage factors) detailed in Table 3. CED represents the cumulative non-renewable fossil energy requirement of the entire process in MJ per 1000 tons WCO. Life cycle GHG emissions is reported as 100-year global warming potential (GWP) in kg CO2 equivalents per 1000 tons WCO. Fig. 8 and Table 13 depict the characterization results in the production of biojet fuel from WCO via CTH and HRJ processes. The left pane demonstrates environmental endpoints (CED and GWP, positive bar) and environmental credits (negative bars). The right pane shows the energy distribution of fuel products produced from CTH and HRJ processes including the energy-return-on-investment (EROI), defined as the ratio of the total energy output from the system to the total energy input into the system. To facilitate analysis, it is important to note that CTH operation includes pressurization energy required to pump WCO and isopropanol to the CTH reactor at 2-bar pressure, cooling energy (negative energy) needed to cool reaction products in low-pressure flash unit, and distillation units (by heat integration), and heat input. On the other hand, HRJ operations involves hydrogen pressurization energy in HY and HH units assuming isentropic compression (85% efficient) and WCO pumping (95% efficient). It also includes cooling energy in the flash separator, high-pressure flash unit, distillation column (exothermic conditions), and heat input. From a gross operations perspective, HRJ exhibits 1.6 times the CED of CTH. This is not surprising given that it has greater upstream fossil energy brought about by the production, pressurization, and delivery of hydrogen. Gaseous hydrogen is primarily produced from stream reforming of natural gas. Isopropanol is the main upstream driver in CED of CTH; albeit insufficient amount to cause higher CED of HRJ. Direct CED of CTH and HRJ systems are negative, that is, surplus electricity is generated by the system. The energy generated from cooling the reactor is re-captured and utilized as in-process energy. HRJ operates at higher temperature than CTH, enabling larger energy release. It also has more reactor units. Consequently, HRJ’s net heat consumption is 26% higher than CTH’s. HRJ’s direct heat use comes from heating the oil from 380 °C to 400 °C plus the heat duty of the distillation column. Although CTH consists of two distillation units in series needing heating of WCO from 300 °C to 380 °C, the combined heat demand is still lower than HRJ’s. Total CED is equal to operations CED plus infrastructure CED. The results suggest that total CED for both systems are equal to their operations CED due to the miniscule contributions of steel. Reactor steel demand for both systems are between 33 and 177 kg/yr, annualized over a 30-year period. The results of operations GWP is consistent with the results of operations CED in both systems, i.e. operations GWP-CTH < operations GWP-HRJ; however, the difference is low at around 8%. This result considers that the net GHG emissions has two components – direct GHG emissions and upstream GHG emissions. Both CTH and HRJ systems do not sequester CO2 through co-product offsets because there is no biogenic carbon embodied in the final fuel unlike jet fuel from algae or switchgrass. While it is true that some WCO are plant-based (olive oil, palm oil, soybean oil, or canola oil), others are animal-derived (butter, lard) or synthetic. In fact, even if this study assumes that all WCO are plant-derived, it is still outside the scope to identify which location produced waste olive oil or canola oil. Thus, this analysis does not consider carbon sequestration. Direct GHG emissions from CTH is higher than direct GHG emissions from HRJ, mainly due to CO2 emissions from low-pressure flash. However, upstream GHG emissions from CTH is 26% lower than HRJ’s because of the considerable emissions associated with hydrogen production. Total GWP is equal to operations GWP due to the insignificant GHG emissions associated with steel in the reactors. Further, both CTH and HRJ systems have no heat offset, i.e. total heat use equals net heat use. The hydrodeoxygenation reaction in HRJ consumes more heat than the CTH reaction. The conversion of 1000 tons/day WCO generates approximately 60 × 106 MJ useable fuel energy in the form of jet fuel, naphtha, and diesel from both CTH and HRJ systems. As evident in the right pane of Fig. 8, relative magnitudes of these energy are similar, except that HRJ reaction does not produce diesel product. HRJ has a slightly lower total energy than CTH despite its higher jet fuel and naphtha production because HRJ does not produce diesel. The EROI of both systems were calculated using total energy output and total energy input. EROI is the system’s energy efficiency measured in terms of energy productivity normalized by energy expenditure. It is used as a decision tool in adapting any process from an energetic standpoint with EROI>1 to be desirable (i.e. energy break-even = 1, total energy output = total energy input). However, different EROIs can be calculated from the same dataset as a result of dissimilar energy accounting methods [68]. In this study, EROI is evaluated as the ratio of the summation of all energy embodied in the main product and co-products plus surplus electricity (if any), and, the summation of net energy (if any), net heat, upstream energy, and infrastructure energy consumption. Although both energy platforms are energetically favorable, CTH’s EROI is 1.8 times higher than HRJ’s, attributable to its lower heat and upstream impacts. Fig. 9 shows that CTH has lower electricity and heat consumption than HRJ; in fact, CTH’s negligible electricity use is credited to pressurization, while the rest of the sub-processes yield in-process heat. Both systems have comparable direct heat use. Because CO2 separation, high-pressure separation, and fractionation units in HJR operate at high temperatures, large amount of heat is expended to lower product temperature. HRJ’s single fractionation unit consumes more than twice the electricity of CTH’s. The relative global warming potential (GWP) contributions reported as kg CO2 equivalents/1000 tons WCO of the different sub-processes for CTH and HRJ systems are presented in Fig. 10 . The results indicate that both systems create similar warming within 100 years (CTH = 376,403. HRJ = 375,420). CTH’s GWP is dominated by emissions from low-pressure flash while HRJ’s is driven by WCO transport emissions. This is surprising given that the CED of HRJ is 1.56 times that of the CED of CTH. A closer look at the GWP breakdown reveals that the main reaction in CTH produces half the GHG emissions of HRJ’s main reaction. Nonetheless, the sum of GHG emissions associated with the sub-processes in CTH, except for WCO/fuel transport and diesel emissions, is higher than HRJ’s by 33%. Beyond CTH’s main reactor, the low-pressure flash generates the most emissions among all sub-processes at 169,390 kg CO2-eq/1000 tons WCO. Such phenomenon is associated with: (1) the atmospheric 3-phase (VLLE) flash unit following CTH that separates gaseous products from the liquid organic fraction and water, and (2) the large temperature differential in cooling the reaction products. The system has neither provision for recouping this large emission for re-use nor method of sequestration. In contrast, emissions associated with low-pressure flash in HRJ is one-fifth that for CTH’s, as exhibited by the stable reactor temperature of HRJ at 24 °C."
13,Effect of allocation method,"3.6 Effect of allocation method The allocation methods were analyzed in the context of understanding the relative effect on CED and GWP (Fig. 11 ). For CTH, CED for main products via mass- and energy-allocations are in the order of millions while CED for main products via market-allocation is in the order of thousands. Conversely, CED for co-products via mass- and energy-allocations are two orders of magnitude greater than CED for co-products via market-allocation. This is due to mass rates (tons/day) corresponding to energy rates (MJ/day) and the LHVs (MJ/kg) among fuel products and co-products are close to each other (min = 42.791, max = 47.206). Yet, market-allocation is based on price ($/gal) and density (kg/m3). Hence, the resulting allocation is remarkably different from mass- and energy-allocations. In the case of CTH, 28.20 M$ is attributed to co-products, of which 28.17 M$ is generated by the sales of gaseous products (C1-C3 gas). Consequently, 98.33% was allocated to co-products while only 1.67% was allocated to main products. Similar trend is observed in HRJ main products: 2.08 MMJ/1000 tons WCO and 2.06 MMJ/1000 tons WCO for mass- and energy-allocations, respectively, while 0.06 MMJ/1000 tons WCO for market-allocation. In the case of co-products, mass- and energy-allocations are in the order of hundred thousand while market-allocation is in the order of millions. Similar trend is observed in GWP. From an environmental life cycle perspective, price and density have more pronounced effect on impacts assessment than LHV. Because this analysis pertains to comparing an emerging energy platform to a more established conventional processing, reporting CED and GWP impacts based on the three allocation methods is vital."
14,Sensitivity,"3.7 Sensitivity The construction of CTH and HRJ models requires the incorporation of materials and process inputs with distributions (“assumptions”) obtained from this study’s experimental results and from various literature sources (Table S70). The models also apply the equivalency factors in Table 3 during life cycle impacts assessment. These factors contain distributions. When analyzing a model, it is useful to know which input variables have the greatest impact on the model’s result (endpoint or forecast). The goal is to determine the driver of a forecast while ignoring inconsequential inputs. The tornado plots presented in Fig. 12 is the result of independently testing each input variable one at a time against the target forecast, CED and GWP for CTH. The Monte Carlo simulation of the models utilized assumptions and generated several charts that depicted the relationships between the assumptions and the target. It is evident that CED and GWP of CTH are dependent on transportation – hauling of WCO/fuels and not on process parameters. For example, a 9% increase in truck mileage efficiency from 5.50 mi/gal base case to 6.05 mi/gal resulted in a 2.4% decrease in CED from the median value of 0.0835 MJ/MJ WCO. The results reveal that as the truck mileage efficiency increases, CED and GWP decrease; whereas, as distance hauled increases, both CED and GWP increase. Of special case is the GHG emissions associated with the electricity equivalency factor (U.S. grid). The base case is 1.0220 kg/kWh and SD = 1. A 125% decrease in electricity equivalency factor resulted in a 68% increase in GWP (0.015–0.047 kg CO2 eq/MJ WCO). Similarly, a 51% decrease in electricity equivalency factor caused a negligible increase in GWP (0.015–0.016 kg CO2 eq/MJ WCO). Results of the sensitivity analysis highlighted two key findings: (1) fossil energy consumption and GWP are highly sensitive to externalities associated with transportation of WCO and fuels, and (2) the relative contributions of surface coal mining, transportation, and electricity generation to GWP are insignificant because the combined effects of these processes tend to amplify GHG emissions. The first finding has an advantage and disadvantage. The advantage relates to the minimal influence of CTH’s reaction chemistry on the environment which allows any research and development to further enhance energy and emissions performance. The CTH-based biofuel plant does not require reconfigurations of the main reactor to cut costs, increase profits, and improve sustainability other than what was detailed in this analysis. Because the CED and GWP drivers are transportation-related and not process-related, the disadvantage would be the effect of diesel fuel used in heavy trucks on the circular bioeconomy, to the extent that diesel’s volatile market creates a gap between any gain or loss incurred by the plant. Such disadvantage has a more pronounced impact on the TEA aspect than the environmental outcome. Given the knowledge that the environmental impacts of CTH are driven by externalities, it is essential to examine the CTH model with regards to variations truck mileage efficiency and distance hauled. There are two types of variations: uncertainty and variability. Uncertainty is the lack of pertinent information about the driver while variability is the characteristic spread of the driver in a set of observations or population. Truck mileage efficiency has variability [39,40] while distance hauled has uncertainty. The current state of trucking industry in the U.S. has been essentially stable and therefore emphasis must be placed on distance traveled, which is a function of the study’s scope. This analysis determined that the most optimal hauling distance is 300 mi/truck-d (6 h per truck per day at 50 miles/hr), obtained from the four-region, nine-division scheme (Section 2.5.1). To capture CTH’s energy outlook as a function of distance hauled and truck mileage efficiency across all regions using process conditions and reaction chemistry described herein, a trend analysis on CTH’s EROI was made on a single CTH-based biojet fuel plant. This plant assumes to transition from HRJ to CTH in one year. The results are presented in Fig. 13 . HRJ’s median EROI of 10.5 lies within the 25% certainty band (range: 10.4–10.6). In other words, HRJ will have a 25% probability of enhancing EROI to 10.6 from the median value of 10.5. It also has a 90% chance of improving EROI to 11.30 from the median value of 10.5. Clearly, the latitude on improvement (or deterioration) of energy efficiency through optimization in the HRJ system is limited (EROI = 10.30–11.30). In contrast, the range by which CTH’s EROI could be improved is quite wide, from 18.6 to a maximum of 25. This finding is significant considering that on a per volume WCO basis, CTH yields statistically equivalent biofuel energy as HRJ, expends half the fossil energy as HRJ, and creates 92% GWP of HRJ’s. Despite isopropanol’s high cost in the TEA (Section 3.3), it only accounts for 57% of CTH’s total CED and surprisingly, around 9% of CTH’s total GWP. The contributions between the CTH’s main reaction system versus HRJ’s on EROI projections are evident in their individual CED. While isopropanol’s CED represents 99% of CTH’s main reaction system (activated carbon’s CED is merely 1% of CTH’s main reaction system and is assumed to be regenerated and replaced every 90 days), CTH reaction constitutes half the CED of HY and HH reactions combined. More importantly, isopropanol’s CED in producing CTH biojet fuel is less than hydrogen’s CED in producing HRJ biojet fuel by a factor of 0.5. Clearly, the environmental opportunities in using an alcohol-based solvent remarkably outweighs any cost barrier."
15,Conclusions,"This study analyzed the techno-economic and environmental life-cycle implications of biojet fuel production from WCO via the CTH process. Results were compared to the conventional HRJ process. TEA results demonstrate that the total CAPEX of CTH plant (7.3 M$) is significantly lower (∼95%) than the total CAPEX of HRJ plant ($149.7 M$). In terms of other economic metrics, CTH outperforms HRJ based on revenues from gaseous fuels (CTH = $13.5M, HRJ = $9.4M) but underperforms based on annual total COM (without depreciation) (CTH = $218.4M, HRJ = $102.2M). The revenues from liquid fuels in both systems are comparable (CTH = $140.4M, HRJ = $141.4M). NPV analysis reveals that to be profitable, and for a break-even point to be less than 10 years, biojet fuel can be sold at $3.00/gal ($0.79/L) and $1.67/gal ($0.44/L) for CTH and HRJ, respectively. At these rates and for a project life of 25 years, the NPV for CTH and HRJ are 8 M$ and 121 M$, respectively. IRR for HRJ is 15.91% while CTH’s IRR profile is untenable without subsidies, incentives, or any of the investigated case scenarios. This TEA demonstrates that the CTH process based on experimental conditions has potential to be economically profitable despite large input cost associated with isopropanol. Given that isopropanol cost represents 68% of CTH’s total COM, total COM must be reduced to around 30% to realize net profit. This is done using a combination of two strategies: (1) reduce both isopropanol cost and total direct/fixed/general cost by 60%, and (2) reduce isopropanol cost by 55%. The LCA results indicate that the environmental opportunities in using an alcohol-based solvent remarkably outweighs any cost barriers. The latitude on improvement (or deterioration) of energy efficiency through optimization of CTH’s process parameters is wide. Despite isopropanol’s restrictive cost, CTH outperforms HRJ, regardless of the allocation method employed. The CED of HRJ is 1.6 times the CED of CTH. Direct CED of CTH and HRJ systems are negative, meaning surplus electricity is generated. In cooling the reactors, they also produce heat, which is re-captured and utilized as in-process energy. HRJ operates at higher temperature than CTH, so HRJ consumes four times more electricity than that of CTH. CTH’s cooling energy requirement is 59% lower than HRJ’s due to the latter’s combined exothermic effect via flash separation and high-pressure flash. Although EROIs for both CTH and HRJ are energetically favorable (EROI > 1), CTH’s EROI is 1.8 times higher than HRJ’s. The total 100-year GWP of CTH is 8% less than HRJ’s, and both systems do not sequester CO2 through co-product offsets. CTH’s GWP is dominated by emissions from low-pressure flash while HRJ’s is driven by WCO transport emissions. Environmental endpoints based on mass- and energy-allocations are relatively similar to each other but remarkably different from market-value allocation. In both systems, price and density have more pronounced effect than LHV has on impacts assessment. The fossil energy consumption and GWP are highly sensitive to externalities associated with transportation of WCO and fuels and the relative contributions of surface coal mining, transportation, and electricity generation to GWP are insignificant because the combined effects of these processes tend to amplify GHG emissions."
