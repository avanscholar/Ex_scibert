0,Introduction,"Benzaldehyde (BzH) is a very important organic intermediate in the industry of perfumery, pharmaceutical, dyestuff and agrochemicals [1]. It is traditionally produced by hydrolysis of benzal chloride and by oxidation of toluene [2,3]. However, BzH produced from hydrolysis of benzal chloride often contains traces of chlorine impurities and copious waste is generated in this process. And the oxidation of toluene is usually carried out in organic solvents which are environmentally undesirable [4]. The widely developed reaction for providing chlorine-free BzH is catalytic liquid phase selective oxidation of BzOH to BzH. In general, oxidation of BzOH to BzH needs stoichiometric or more stoichiometric quantities of inorganic oxidants. However, these oxidants are usually expensive and generate copious amounts of heavy-metal waste [5]. The increasing demand for environment-conscious chemical processes and the need of chlorine-free BzH required in perfumery and pharmaceutical industries have impelled many researchers to investigate truly “green” technologies [6–15]. Aqueous hydrogen peroxide is a highly attractive oxidant because it is a cheap, mild and environmentally benign reagent with a high content of ‘active’ oxygen, and water is the only by-product. Thus, in the past decade, many catalytic systems had been researched for selective-oxidation of BzOH with H2O2 by using eco-friendly catalysts, such as tetra-alkylpyridinium octamolybdate [7], Au/U3O8 [8], Fe(Cu)-containing coordination polymers [9], hydrotalcite [10,11] and layered-double hydroxides [12]. Recently, Endud et al. [13] prepared a Sn-MCM-48 catalyst by modifying mesoporous silica MCM-48 with SnCl2. Wang et al. [14] reported a MCM-41 immobilized Cr(salen) catalyst and the catalytic performance was improved by surface-modifying with hydrophobic methyl. A catalyst of Cu/SBA-15 was in situ synthesized by Du et al. [15] using hydrothermal method, and the conversion of BzOH reached 47.6% after reaction at 353K for 6h over that catalyst. However, as we know, the studies focused on the molecular sieve catalyst for liquid phase oxidation of BzOH to BzH are limited in above-mentioned workings and all the reported catalysts are based on mesoporous materials, and no microporous zeolite catalyst has been reported on liquid phase oxidation of BzOH by now. ZSM-5 zeolite is one of the most well-known solid acid catalysts, and has been widely used in the petrochemical industry. However, its smaller pore size and acidic properties (Brönsted/Lewis) are disadvantage for performing the high activity in some reactions. So a post-treated method, namely desilication by alkaline treatment has been introduced to enlarge its pore and modify its acidic properties, and the related workings have shown that the performance was improved owning to the formation of mesopores and the change of acidic properties. For example, the catalytic stability of ZSM-5 zeolite in butene aromatization [16] and in 1-hexene aromatization and isomerization [17] was improved by the treatment of it with sodium hydroxide. In n-octane cracking [18], the selectivity for propene was higher over alkali-treated zeolites due to the formation of mesopores. Furthermore, it was investigated in detail by Ogura et al. [19] and Wei et al. [20] for modification of the structural and acidic properties of ZSM-5 and ZSM-12 with alkali-treatment technique. It is, therefore, of both practical and scientific interest to explore one stable, economic and high active catalyst for selective oxidation of BzOH under the organic solvent-free conditions to make the process environmentally more benign. In the present work, the commercial ZSM-5 zeolite was modified by alkali-treatment with high concentration NaOH solution at low temperature in short time, and then used as catalyst for liquid phase selective oxidation of BzOH with H2O2. Furthermore, the effects of parameters, including the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of as-received sample, alkali-treated time, acid properties of catalysts and dosage of H2O2 on the catalytic performance have been investigated in detail. Based on these catalytic results, the conditions for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol were optimized."
1,Experimental,
2,Alkali-treatment of ZSM-5 zeolite,"2.1 Alkali-treatment of ZSM-5 zeolite All the HZSM-5 zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were supplied by the Catalyst Plant of Nankai University. The alkali-treatment procedure was carried out as follows: 10g of as-received HZSM-5 zeolite was dispersed in 100mL of 2N NaOH solution under stirring. The mixture was then heated to 323K and kept at this temperature for stipulated time, and then the solid was filtrated out, washed with deionized water until neutral filtrate was received, and dried at 393K for 4h. According to the difference in the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, the treated zeolite samples were marked as “xZSM(AT-y)”, where x denotes the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the as-received sample and y denotes the alkali-treatment time."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FT-IR) analysis was conducted on a Bruker VECTOR22 spectrometer with a resolution of 1cm−1 for the framework of materials. It was conducted using KBr wafers (1wt% sample mixed with 99wt% KBr). The acid sites (Brönsted or Lewis) were determined by the pyridine-adsorption FT-IR spectrometry on self-supported wafers. The wafers were pre-heated at 673K for 1.5h under 10−4 Torr vacuum, and then, after cooling to room temperature, the pyridine vapor was introduced. Finally, the samples were exposed to vacuum at 473K for 1h, and then the FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption were collected. The FT-IR spectra in the OH-stretching region were obtained with self-supported wafers. The wafers were pre-heated at 673K for 2.0h under 10−4 Torr vacuum, and then the FT-IR spectra in the OH-stretching region were collected at 393K. Temperature program desorption (TPD) of NH3 was carried out on an apparatus with a JS-3050 detector. Prior to the adsorption of NH3, ca. 100mg of sample was first preheated at 773K under flowing Ar for 0.5h to remove physisorbed species, then cooled to 333K. Subsequently, the sample was exposed to flowing ammonia gas mixture (5% NH3 in Ar) for 0.5h, and then purged by Ar gas for 1h to remove excessive physisorbed ammonia. All NH3-TPD profiles were carried out by ramping the temperature from 333K to 1073K at a rate of 10Kmin−1. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were obtained by using Shimadzu SS-550 electron microscope. Crystal structure was characterized by using a Rigaku D/MAX 2500 powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) at a scanning speed of 4°/min, with Cu Kα line as incident radiation and a filter. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at 77K with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 volumetric apparatus. Specific surface areas were calculated following the BET procedure. Pore diameter was estimated by applying the HK method to the adsorption branch of the isotherm."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests A typical selective oxidation of BzOH was carried out in a 100mL round-bottom flask equipped with water condenser and magnetic stirrer. First, a mixture of 1.0g of alkali-treated ZSM-5 catalyst, 13.0mL of 30% H2O2 and 26.0mL of deionized water was stirred for 15min, then 10.4mL of BzOH was added and unceasingly stirred for another 15min. The resulting mixture was heated to reflux and kept for 4h, then cooled to room temperature. The reaction products and unconverted benzyl alcohol were extracted with 20.0mL of ethyl acetate and washed with 20.0mL saturated brine, then dried with excessive magnesium sulfate anhydrous for 12h and analyzed by gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector, using a SGE AC20 capillary column (Polyethylene glycol, 30m×0.32mm×0.50μm) and N2 as carrier gas (Inj. temp. 533K, Dect. temp. 503K, Column temp. 473K, N2 pressure: 0.1MPa). The catalyst was recycled by filtration and washed with a little amount of alcohol."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physico-chemical properties of alkali-treated MFI zeolites,"3.1 Physico-chemical properties of alkali-treated MFI zeolites The XRD patterns of as-received and alkali-treated ZSM-5 zeolites are given in Fig. 1 , from which it can be seen that the specific MFI structure was preserved and no impurity phase was found after alkali-treatment for different time. However, the relative crystallinity became lower with increasing treatment time, which believed by Groen et al. [21] is due to the removal of some Si atoms from the framework without intensively destroying the lattice structure. Since alkaline solution dissolved silica and/or alumina from the zeolite framework, a significant change was observed in the morphology of the alkali-treated ZSM-5 zeolites from their SEM images (see Fig. 2 ). As shown in Fig. 2, the surface of ZSM-5 became rough, i.e., appearing some cracks and defects on the surface after a severe alkali-treatment for 0.5h, and the edges of particles of ZSM-5 seemed to have melted and very irregular after alkali-treatment for 3.0h. In addition, the SEM images (Fig. 2e,f) indicate that most of the as-received sample particles are conglutinated together, however, the zeolite particles are well dispersed and exist separately from each other after treatment with the 2.0N NaOH solution at 323K even for 0.5h. It is because the amorphous entities, which conglutinate the zeolite primary particles together, are dissolved firstly when the zeolite samples were treated in alkali solution. Furthermore, by dissolving framework silica, the formation of cracks and defects on particles surface decreased the contact area between the particles evidently, which reduced the strength of the electrostatic attraction and capillary attraction and prevented the particle from aggregating together effectively. The changes in the surface area, pore size, pore volume and the SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios of the alkali-treated ZSM-5 zeolites are listed in Table 1 , which revealed that the treatment of the zeolites with 2.0N NaOH solution at 323K for 0.5h, even longer treatment time, did not cause very significant changes in their pore size, and no mesopore formed during the alkali-treated process. However, the external surface area increased with increasing of treatment time, which can be attributed to the presence of surface cracks and defects resulted by the dissolution of framework silica and/or alumina atoms in zeolite surface. This may be explained by the fact that the treatment with weak alkali only dissolved a part of pore walls, resulting in the formation of mesopores [22]. However, the treatment of MFI zeolite with strong alkali at low temperature mainly dissolved the external composition. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of ZSM-5 zeolite decreased with increasing the alkali-treatment time (i.e., from 24.9 of untreated sample to 20.2 of 25ZSM(AT-3.0)), which is due to a preferential removal of silicon species during the alkali-treatment. The acidic properties of alkali-treated and as-received zeolites were investigated to evaluate the acidities of the alkali-treated samples compared to the as-received HZSM-5 zeolite. The profiles of NH3-TPD for different samples are shown in Fig. 3 , from which two distinct NH3 desorption peaks are seen for the untreated sample of 25ZSM(AT-0). One peak centers at about 573K and the other at about 803K, corresponding to the weak and the strong acid sites, respectively. Compared with that of untreated sample, the amount of strong acid sites in the alkali-treated samples evidently decreased. Such weakening in the strong acid sites was accordingly thought to be the results of the desilication by splitting Si–OH–Al groups and the ion-exchange of H+ with Na+ during the alkali-treatment of ZSM-5 zeolites. So only a broadened NH3 desorption peak is seen in the profiles of alkali-treated zeolites, and the peak intensities, i.e., the amounts of acid sites, decreased with prolonged alkali-treatment. Moreover, a new high temperature NH3 desorption peak appeared at about 870K in the NH3-TPD profile of the sample 25ZSM(AT-3.0), which was reported to be attributed to extra framework aluminium formed during the alkali-treatment [23]. The IR spectra of pyridine adsorption (as presented in Fig. 4A) revealed the change of the amount of acid sites (Brönsted or Lewis) in zeolite after alkali-treatment. According to the reported work [24,25], the band at 1546cm−1 is assigned to Brönsted acid sites and the band at 1444cm−1 represents the Lewis acid sites. The results showed the intensity of the band at 1444cm−1 increased evidently after alkali-treatment, i.e., the amount of Lewis acid sites increased, which was attributed to the formation of more framework Al-Lewis sites, partly framework Al-Lewis sites and extra framework Al-Lewis sites via splitting the bond Si–O–Al by alkaline solution (see Scheme 1 ). Whereas, the intensity of the band at 1546cm−1 (Brönsted acid sites) decreased severely, which was resulted by the splitting of bridging Si–OH–Al·groups and the ion-exchange of H+ with Na+ during alkali-treatment. Fig. 4B and C gave the FT-IR spectra of samples in the OH-stretching region and in the T-O-T region, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4B, all the treated samples exhibited a band of OH groups connected to extra framework Al at 3667cm−1, which is shifted by alkali metal ion from 3660cm−1 to 3667cm−1 [26]. From Fig. 4B, it can be also easily found that the intensity of band at 3738cm−1, which is generally attributed to terminal Si–OH groups, increased with increasing the treatment time, and the strong intensity of band at 3607cm−1, which is due to the bridging SiOHAl groups, appeared in the spectrum of 25ZSM(AT-0) decreased seriously with increasing the treatment time. This indicated that more Si–O–Si and Si–O–Al groups had been splitted with prolonging treatment time. In addition, the alkali-treated samples exhibited a low-intensity band at 3794cm−1, which is ascribed to the presence of partly framework Al species with no regularly tetrahedral coordination. From Fig. 4C, it can be found that the intensity of the band at 944cm−1 of Si–OH groups increased with increasing the treatment time. This also revealed that more Si–OH groups formed during alkali-treatment process."
7,Catalytic performance of alkali-treated ZSM-5 zeolites for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"3.2 Catalytic performance of alkali-treated ZSM-5 zeolites for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol 3.2.1 Evaluation of alkali-treated ZSM-5 zeolites for benzyl alcohol selective oxidation It has been reported [6] that the temperature has strong influence on the progress of BzOH oxidation, which is believed as a very slow, kinetically controlled reaction with the catalyst in the H2O2 aqueous phase. Effect of reaction temperature on the progress of oxidation of BzOH was studied in the temperature range of 353K to reflux temperature and the results are presented in Fig. 5 . The results suggested that the conversion of BzOH and the selectivity to BzH increased with increasing the reaction temperature, especially for the selectivity to BzH increased from 38% to more than 85% with the increase in temperature from 353k to reflux temperature. It is attributed to the fact that the consumption of H2O2 for oxidation of BzOH to BzH at higher temperature was more compared to that at 353K [27]. So the selective oxidation reaction is dominant when the reaction is conducted at higher temperature, resulting in a higher conversion of BzOH and a higher selectivity to BzH. The conversion of BzOH and the selectivity to BzH over the 25ZSM(AT-0.5) at different reaction time are shown in Fig. 6 , which indicated that the initial conversion of BzOH increased with the reaction processing and reached the maximal conversion of 53% after reaction for 4h, and then remained stable, which is due to the consume of H2O2 by oxidation of BzOH and self-decomposition. On the other hand, the slight decrease in selectivity to BzH is due to a further oxidation of BzH to benzoic acid (BzA). Based on the results of conversion and selectivity, 4h was selected as the optimal reaction time. The dosage of hydrogen peroxide is another important parameter influencing the results of this oxidation reaction. According to stoichiometry, one mole of H2O2 is required to give one mole of BzH from one mole of BzOH. Effect of mole ratio of H2O2/BzOH was investigated in range of 1.0–2.0 and the results are given in Fig. 7 , from which a lower conversion of BzOH was observed with 1.0 mole ratio of H2O2/BzOH. Although a higher conversion of BzOH was obtained when the mole ratio of H2O2/BzOH is 2.0, the percentage selectivity to BzH was reduced around 20%, resulted by the excess unreacted H2O2 in reaction mixture, as compared to that obtained with 1.0 mole ratio of H2O2 to BzOH. Based on the results, the mole ratio of 1.3 was chosen as the optimal ratio of H2O2/BzOH. The reaction results presented in Table 2 indicated that the alkali-treated ZSM-5 zeolite is an efficient catalyst for selective oxidation of BzOH to BzH. In Table 2, a very poor conversion of BzOH (only 2%) obtained from the reaction system without catalyst is listed (entry 1). It indicated that the hydrogen peroxide itself is inefficient for oxidation of BzOH. Oxidations of BzOH had been also carried out over 25ZSM(AT-0) (entry 2), 25HZSM(AT-0.5) (entry 3) and 25ZSM(AT-0.5) (entries 4–9). The results revealed that the conversion of BzOH and the selectivity to BzH increased (entries 4–9) with increasing catalyst amount when it is no more than 1.0g. It can be attributed to the reason that the excess unreacted H2O2 will further oxides the resultant product of benzaldehyde, which is active and can be oxidized by oxygen in air at room temperature, when the dosage of catalyst less than 1.0g. A further increase of catalyst amount gave a higher selectivity to BzH, however, a lower conversion of BzOH was received because of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide resulted by excess catalyst. By comparing entries 2, 3 with entry 7, it can be also easily found that the alkali metal Na+ ion presented in catalyst did not reduce its activity. This further revealed that the active sites in the catalyst are Lewis acid sites. So the alkali-treated catalyst exhibited a higher catalytic activity because the Lewis acid sites in catalyst was increased by alkali-treatment. Although alkali-treatment can improve the activity of catalyst, longer time treatment (entries 10–12) did not give a further improvement in catalytic activity, it is because longer time treatment not only did not make more active sites forming on catalyst surface but also dissolved some surface aluminum lowering the catalytic activity. It should be pointed that the zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were also alkali-treated and the catalytic performance of their corresponding products was evaluated (entries 13 and 14). The results showed that the conversion of BzOH decreased seriously with increasing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in as-received zeolites. It can be attributed to the decrease of the concentration of Lewis acids on surface of treated zeolite with increasing of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. The stability of the 25ZSM(AT-0.5) catalyst had been also investigated and the results for six runs are given in Fig. 8 . It is interesting to note that the catalyst was very stable, furthermore, the reused catalyst showed a higher conversion of BzOH than that of fresh catalyst. This is attributed to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by the free OH− remaining in fresh catalyst, which makes more hydrogen peroxide decompose quickly into oxygen and water. 3.2.2 The reasons for the improvement in the catalytic performance selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol The acidity of MFI zeolites depends strongly on the amount of aluminum atoms in the framework and the degree of crystallinity. The changes in their acid properties resulted by a partial dissolution of ZSM-5 zeolite framework were observed after alkali-treatment (see Figs. 3 and 4), especially the amount of Lewis acid sites increased evidently. It has demonstrated by Bortnovsky et al. [26] that the Lewis acid sites are mainly presented by Al atoms which are still bound in the framework, but their environment was highly distorted. The amount of the distorted Al atoms can be increased by alkali-treatment because silica is dissolved in alkaline solution more than alumina does [16,18,22], i.e., the solubility of silica in alkaline solution is relatively higher compared to that of alumina. The decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio determined by ICP (presented in Table 1) revealed that the concentration of Al, containing framework Al atoms, partly framework Al atoms and extra framework Al species, in the surface layers of zeolites increased with prolonging treatment time (see Scheme 1). So the concentration of Lewis acid sites for treated zeolites was much higher compared to that of untreated zeolite (Fig. 2a), however, the concentration of Brönsted acid sites was much lower. As described in documents [13,27], Lewis acid sites were believed as the active sites in catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2 in water. The involved mechanism is proposed in Fig. 9 . Firstly, the Al Lewis acid site reacts with H2O2 to form Al peroxo complex and the complex further reacts with BzOH to give an intermediate which gives benzaldehyde and regenerated active site. The higher catalytic activity of alkali-treated catalyst for oxidation of BzOH should be attributed to the increase of active sites, i.e., Lewis acid sites, which is originated from splitting the bridging Si–OH–Al groups by alkali-treatment. However, more and more extra framework Al, only apart of which possesses Lewis acid properties, appeared as prolonging treatment time (see Fig. 4B), so the concentration of Lewis acid sites decreased in the zeolite treated for longer time, which leads a decrease of the catalystic activity. On the other hand, the extra framework Al presented in treated zeolite had been reported to cause strengthened acidity of zeolite [28], which can enhance the ability of H2O2 for selective oxidation of BzOH to BzH [29]. So, the 25ZSM(AT-3.0) catalyst possesses a lower conversion of BzOH with a higher selectivity to BzH."
8,Conclusions,"The alkali-treatment of ZSM-5 zeolite with relative high concentration NaOH solution at low temperature did not cause very significant change in its pore size but melted the external surface. The cracks and defects appeared on the surface of treated zeolite gave highly dispersive particles and prevented them re-conglutinate effectively. The amount of Lewis acid sites was evidently increased by splitting the bridging Si–OH–Al groups with NaOH solution. The alkali-treated ZSM-5 zeolite is a stable, economic and high active catalyst for selective oxidation of BzOH to BzH by using H2O2 as oxidant at reflux condition. The improvement of catalytic activity was attributed to the increase of Lewis acid sites by splitting the bridging Si–OH–Al groups with alkaline solution. The catalytic performances of the re-used alkali-treated ZSM-5 catalysts, even for using six times, were comparable with that of the fresh catalyst, giving this catalyst a good prospect for benzaldehyde production in industry."
