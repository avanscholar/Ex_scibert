0,Introduction,"Dehydrogenation of alcohols is an important reaction in industrial synthetic chemistry for the production of aldehydes and ketones, which serve as essential commodity chemicals. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohols is the traditional route for the industrial aldehyde synthesis process. Supported metal nanoparticles have been used as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogeation of alcohols [1]. CuO nanoparticle catalysts have also been tested to be efficient for the oxidative hydrogenation of a wide range of benzylic and cyclic alcohols with air [2]. The selective oxidation of ethanol over copper, silver, and their alloys or oxides is one of the commercial processes to produce acetaldehyde on an industrial scale [3]. However, the use of oxidants makes the process hazardous and incurs high cost of product separation. Recently, the non-oxidative dehydrogenation (NODH) process has received considerable attention as it prevents the over-oxidation of carboxyl functionality and eliminates the production of water which leads to the deactivation of catalyst. Besides these, the oxidant free dehydrogenation makes the process relatively safer, enabling higher atom efficiency as hydrogen is also produced, which in and of itself is a valuable product. The selective dehydrogenation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds can also be aligned with the current trends in catalysis, wherein biomass derived feedstock is used to mitigate the use of petroleum or fossil fuels and therefore, reduce the carbon footprint [4,5]. Despite the industrial success of the oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the NODH of various benzylic [6], cyclic and aliphatic alcohols have been explored on a number of catalyst surfaces which include Ag [7–10], Cu [11–15] and Au [16]. Moromi et al. studied the non-oxidative dehydrogenation-coupling of primary alcohols over Pt catalyst [17]. Experimental studies conducted over the oxidant free alcohol dehydrogenation on Cu/HT by Mitsudome et al. have shown that the conversion and selectivity for the dehydrogenated product was much lower on primary alcohol as compared to that of secondary alcohol [14]. They observed the conversion and selectivity for octanone to be 97 % and 99 %, respectively from 2-octanol (secondary alcohol). In contrast, the conversion of 1-heptanol (primary alcohol) was found to be 19 % whereas the selectivity towards aldehyde product was 47 %. Further, Takato and group have explored the NODH of cyclic, benzylic and aliphatic alcohols on supported Ag and Cu nanoparticles [10,14]. The study showed that amongst the aliphatic alcohols, primary alcohols exhibited a much lower conversion and product selectivity as opposed to secondary alcohols. In a study conducted by Shimizu over Ag catalyst, a similar trend was observed wherein octan-2-ol showed a higher conversion (53 %) and yield (50 %) as compared to octan-1-ol for which the conversion and yield were found to be 27 % and 16 %, respectively [18]. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) simulations are employed to understand the shift in activity and selectivity trends between primary and secondary alcohols, using propanol and isopropanol as probe molecules. The NODH of propanol and isopropanol is investigated over Cu catalyst as it is widely used catalyst for the NODH reaction of alcohols at large [11–15]. Furthermore, Cu has also been shown to be the most active transition metal catalyst for the NODH of ethanol at low temperature (423 K) by first principle microkinetic modeling [19,20]. Propanol and isopropanol constitute an ideal system to undertake this study owing to the small size. Previously, an experimental study based on dehydrogenation of isopropanol over Cu was undertaken by Rioux and Vannice, wherein the first dehydrogenation step was proposed to be rate limiting upon assuming Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics [11]. Similar efforts have been made in this direction by Wawrzetz et al. wherein they explored the differentiation of the mechanisms of aqueous phase reactions of propanol and isopropanol over Pt catalyst [21]. Besides experimental work, computational studies have also been conducted to rationalize the reactivity difference between propanol and isopropanol over Pt(111) [22] as well as to understand the reaction kinetics of dehydrogenation of propan-1-ol over Fe/Ni (111) and Cu/Ni (111) [23]. In a DFT study based on the hydrogenation of propanal to propanol over Cu(111) and Ni(111), hydroxyl route was observed to dominate on Ni(111) whereas Cu(111) preferred the alkoxy route [24]. In earlier experimental and computational investigation of hydrogenation of propanal and acetone over Pt, contrasting trends are observed – slower rate of propanal hydrogenation is observed experimentally [25], however, DFT study suggested a faster rate of propanal hydrogenation as opposed to acetone owing to lower activation barrier [25,26]. This contradictory observation is attributed to the formation of strongly adsorbed species upon removal of H from propanal which limits the number of available catalytically active sites, thereby lowers the reaction rate. Overall, these studies do not elaborate upon dissimilar reactivity patterns between primary and secondary alcohols as observed experimentally for the oxidant free dehydrogenation process. Thus, by evaluating the reaction pathways for NODH of propanol and isopropanol over the terrace sites of Cu, this study aims to provide a mechanistic insight into the activity difference between primary and secondary alcohols. The dehydrogenation reactions are in general considered to be structure insensitive, as the closed packed (111) terrace and the undercoordinated step-sites show similar activity [27]. As the closed-packed (111) terrace sites are most abundant (>95 %) in the Cu nanoparticles [28], the dehydrogenation reactions predominantly occur at the (111) terrace sites. Further, these sites are experimentally shown to favour dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions whereas stepped sites catalyse the hydrodeoxygenation reaction [29–31]. Besides that, in previous computational studies based on esterification, dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of alcohols and aldehyde, researchers have employed (111) terrace sites of Cu to understand the reaction mechanism [24,28]. In addition, Hansen et al. also focussed on the terrace sites of the transition metal catalysts to conduct microkinetic modelling study for NODH [32]. Exploring the NODH reaction on the terrace sites of Cu catalyst and analysis of the subsequent dehydrogenation steps of the alcohols will highlight the essential differences that result in the disparate activity and product selectivity."
1,Methodology,"The calculations of NODH of propanol and isopropanol over Cu(111) are performed using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP 5.3.5) implementation of periodic plane-wave DFT [33]. The surface of Cu(111) is modelled by a 4 × 4 supercell having a four layer slab of metal catalyst with a vacuum of 20 Å between the slabs along the z-axis. The Revised Perdew-Burke-Erbzerhof (RPBE) parameterization of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is used to describe the exchange-correlation energy of the electrons [34]. vdW corrections are incorporated to take into account the dispersion effects which alter the binding energies calculations [35]. Moreover, it has been previously shown that for Cu(211), vdW-correction of the RPBE calculated adsorption energies resulted in better agreement with experiments as compared to the case wherein the vdW correction was not applied [36]. The core electrons are defined using projected augmented wave (PAW) potential [33]. The iterative diagonalization of the Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian is employed to determine the self-consistent electron density. Kohn–Sham one-electron valence states are expanded using a plane wave basis set truncated to a cut-off energy of 396 eV. The surface Brillouin zone sampling is undertaken using a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grid [37]. Previously, An et al. employed a similar mesh size in the study of hydrogenation of propanol on Cu(111) surface [24]. Further, for understanding esterification and aldol condensation of propanol and propanal over the (111) site of Cu, Neurock et al. used a K-point mesh of 3 × 2 × 1 [28]. For benchmarking, binding energy of propanol is calculated using 6 × 6 × 1 mesh size. The calculated value of binding energy (−69.1 kJ/mol) was observed to be the same as that computed for 3 × 3 × 1 (−68.7 kJ/mol). For the structure optimizations, the energy and force convergence criteria have been set to 1 × 10−6 eV and 0.05 eV/Å, respectively. The binding energy (E b ) of the adsorbate is calculated with respect to the clean surface and the gas phase reactant species, as follows: (1) E b = E surf+adsorbate – (E surf + E adsorbate,gas ) where E surf , E surf+adsorbate , and E adsorbate, gas denotes the energy of the cleaved surface, energy of adsorbate species on the metal surface and energy of gas phase adsorbate respectively. Desorption energy is described as the difference in the energy of the adsorbate in gas phase with respect to that on the surface. The reaction energy (Erxn) of the elementary surface reaction steps is evaluated as the difference between final (product) and initial state (reactant) energies, as per the equation: (2) E rxn = E final - E initial where E initial and E final is the energy of the initial and final state of the elementary surface reaction step, respectively. Structures of the transition state on the minimum energy path joining the reactant and the product is calculated using the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method [38], wherein a total of 16 images between the initial and final states are given along the potential energy surface until the force on each structure is converged to 0.5 eV/Å. Geometries of the transition state are determined using the climbing image NEB method as proposed by Henkelman et al. [39]. The presence of imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinate in the transition state is confirmed from normal mode frequency analysis of the transition state structure. In all of the DFT calculations, the top two layers of the four-layer slab model along with the adsorbates are allowed to relax whereas the remaining two bottom layers are fixed at their bulk positions. Intrinsic activation barrier of the elementary reaction step is evaluated as the difference between the transition state and the reactant state, given by: (3) E a = E transition state – E reactant where E transition state and E reactant represents the energy of the transition state and reactant of the elementary step, respectively."
2,Results and discussion,"DFT calculations are performed in order to understand the reactivity and selectivity trends of NODH of primary and secondary alcohols as observed in experiments conducted in oxidant free environment [10,14]. Propanol and isopropanol are taken as model molecules for NODH study over the Cu (111) facets. Scheme 1 depicts the possible pathways for NODH of propanol and isopropanol which includes the cleavage of OH, CH, CC and CO bonds towards the formation of products. Experimentally, OH bond dissociation of alcohols forming alkoxide species has been observed to the preferred route [12,40,41]. Alkoxy route has also been shown to be the preferred mechanism as compared to hydroxyl route by An et al. [24] for hydrogenation of propanal over Cu(111). In order to understand the preferred route for alcohol dehydrogenation, we have previously conducted a detailed ab initio microkinetic analysis of NODH reaction of ethanol and concluded that the initial dissociation occurs primarily by means of OH bond scission resulting in the formation of alkoxy species [19,42]. Therefore, we have explored the alkoxy route for the NODH reaction in this mechanistic study. Scheme 2 represents the alkoxy reaction pathway explored herein for the NODH of primary alcohol (propanol) and the secondary alcohol (isopropanol). For the primary alcohol, the NODH is proceeding with the initial OH bond scission of propanol forming 1-propoxy, followed by successive dehydrogenation of 1-propoxy towards the formation of propanaldehyde as the product. In subsequent dehydrogenation of adsorbed propanaldehyde, propionyl is formed, which may end up forming an ester (propyl propanoate) as shown in Scheme 2. Similar reaction network has been explored by Neurock et al. to study the esterification and aldol condensation reaction on Cu catalyst [28]. From their results, it can be clearly seen that the barrier for hydroxyl route (144 kJ/mol) is much higher as compared to that of alkoxy pathway (120 kJ/mol) [28]. Further, alkoxy dehydrogenation pathway is explored for the secondary alcohol as well. The dehydrogenation reaction of the secondary alcohol, as shown in Scheme 2, initiates with the OH scission of isopropanol, which dehydrogenates forming 2-propoxy, following the alkoxy route. The successive dehydrogenation of 2-propoxy produces acetone. To undergo further dehydrogenation as in case of primary alcohol forming propionyl, there is no α-H in acetone. The subsequent dehydrogenation of acetone, however, may take place by the cleavage of C–H bond at β position, thus, forming 2-oxypropyl. For the NODH of propanol, a number of binding configurations of propanol on Cu(111) surface have been explored. Fig. 1 (a) shows the most stable adsorbed structure of propanol. The other optimized structures of propanol adsorbed on terrace sites of Cu are shown in Fig. SI-1. In the most stable geometry, the alcohol binds on-top to the surface via hydroxyl oxygen in η1 configuration. The η2 (parallel) configuration is calculated to show a much lower binding energy (−54.1 kJ/mol) as shown in Supporting Information (Fig. SI-1(a)). The binding configurations shown in Fig. SI-1(b), SI-I(c) and SI-1(d) are exhibiting η1 (perpendicular) configuration and exhibiting a higher binding energy than η2 configuration (Fig. SI-1(a)), as has been reported previously [26,41]. In the most preferred geometry, the hydroxyl oxygen is located at a distance of 2.3 Å from the surface (Fig. 1(a)). Propanol binds strongly to the surface with the binding energy of -68.7 kJ/mol. The OH bond length of propanol is 0.9 Å. A computational study conducted on the dehydrogenation of alcohols on Cu(110) calculated the binding energy of propanol as −97.9 kJ/mol using GGA-PBE functional [43]. The binding energy calculated over Cu(110) is calculated to be higher (stronger adsorption) than that obtained in this study possibly due to the higher degree of undercoordination of (110) facets [12]. Similar configurations have also been reported previously on propanol adsorption on Cu surface [24,43]. In fact, this is the most stable configuration for a number of alcohols over the surface of transition metal catalysts [26,41]. The first dehydrogenation step of 1-propanol towards the formation of 1-propoxy is endothermic in nature. The reaction energy for this dehydrogenation step is calculated to be 44.8 kJ/mol. Previous calculations conducted for the hydrogenation of propanol over Cu calculated the dehydrogenation of 1-propoxy to be endothermic [28]. The endothermicity is further corroborated by the high activation barrier for the OH bond scission, which is calculated to be 96.8 kJ/mol, shown as the first activation barrier in reaction energy diagram for NODH of propanol shown in Fig. 2 . An et al. obtained slightly higher barrier of 112 kJ/mol for the dehydrogenation of propanol over Cu(111) [24]. However, the study did not incorporate vdW corrections. In the transition state (Fig. 1(TSab)) of propanol dehydrogenation, the hydroxyl bond of reactant alcohol stretches and inclines towards the surface. The OH bond distance in the transition state increases from 0.9 Å in the reactant state (Fig. 1(a)) to 2.1 Å, indicating towards a late transition state observed in the initial OH bond scission of propanol. The binding mode in the transition state changes from the on-top adsorption configuration of reactant propanol (Fig. 1(a)) to three fold position (Fig. 1(TSab)). In the transition state, the hydroxyl H is abstracted from the alcohol, forming 1-propoxy as depicted in Fig. 1(TSab). The 1-propoxy specie binds three-fold to the Cu(111) surface via the O atom and H atom now dissociated from the hydroxyl also binds in a similar fashion. In the product state, the binding configuration is similar to that of the transition state, the distance between O and H atom of the hydroxyl group increasing to 2.9 Å in the product state (Fig. 1(b)). The reaction energy of the initial dehydrogenation step from reactant propanol to product 1-propoxy, as depicted in Fig. 1(a) and 1(b) respectively, is calculated to be 44.8 kJ/mol. The dehydrogenation via alkoxy route is calculated to be endothermic, as observed previously in the DFT study based on esterification and subsequent aldol condensation conducted by Neurock et al. [28]. Following the alkoxy route, which is the preferred mechanistic pathway for alcohol dehydrogenation at large, the 1-propoxy surface species further undergoes α-H abstraction forming the product propanaldehyde (Scheme 2), as illustrated in Fig. 1(c) and (d). The bond distance between α-C and H in 1-propoxy is observed to be 1.1 Å as depicted in Fig. 1(c). The activation energy for the formation of propanaldehyde from 1-propoxy is calculated to be 83 kJ/mol (Fig. 2), which is similar to that observed for the initial dehydrogenation, however, 14 kJ/mol smaller. This is indicating that the if the alcohol undergoes the first dehydrogenation path, it will certainly overcome the second dehydrogenation barrier as well resulting in the formation of propanaldehyde on the surface [1,44]. Neurock et al. also observed comparable barriers for the first and second dehydrogenation step in their computational study [28]. Bowker and Madix experimentally reported the activation barrier for 1-propoxy to be 87.6 kJ/mol which is close to that obtained in this mechanistic study [45]. In the transition state, the binding mode of oxygen is changing from three-fold to on-top. The hydrogen abstracted from the α-C also binds on-top to the surface (Fig. 1(TScd)). The C–H distance now increases to 2.8 Å in the transition state. The dehydrogenation step is again endothermic as has been reported in previous studies [28]. However, in this mechanistic study, the level of endothermicity of this dehydrogenation step is lower as compared to the dehydrogenation of hydroxyl bond (Fig. 1(a) and 1(b)). The reaction energy is calculated to be 12.1 kJ/mol as depicted in Fig. 1 for dehydrogenation from 1(c) to 1(d). Therefore, the second dehydrogenation pathway is thermodynamically as well as kinetically more favourable than the first one owing to the lower reaction energy and activation barrier for the reaction (Fig. 2). The product propanaldehyde desorbs from the surface, the oxygen and the α-H at a distance of 2.8 Å from the surface and abstracted hydrogen binds three fold to Cu(111) (Fig. 1(d)). The distance between the hydrogen and carbon atom from which it is abstracted is 3.2 Å. The product state is indeed similar to the transition state configuration, thus suggesting a late transition state. The propanaldehyde may further desorb from the surface, the desorption energy of the propanaldehyde being 53.4 kJ/mol, which is depicted as the green pathway in the reaction energy diagram shown in Fig. 2 and Scheme 2. The binding energy of propanaldehyde, shown in Fig. 1(e), is calculated to be 29.5 kJ/mol. The hydrogen atoms abstracted in the dehydrogenation pathway combine to form H2. The elementary reaction step is exhibiting an intrinsic energy barrier of 52.8 kJ/mol and a reaction energy of 31.9 kJ/mol (marked in blue color in Fig. 2). Corresponding structures of adsorbed reactant, product and transition state are shown in Fig. SI-2. In the reactant state, the distance between hydrogen atoms is 2 Å, each hydrogen atom binding three fold to the Cu(111) surface as shown in Fig. SI-2(a). Further, in the transition state depicted in Fig. SI-2(TSab), a bond is formed between the two hydrogen atoms while they continue to adsorb in three fold position. The HH distance is calculated to be 1 Å in the transition state (Fig. SI-2(TSab)). Finally, in the product state, H2 desorbs from the surface. The HH bond distance is 0.8 Å, and the distance of the H2 from the surface is 3 Å. Propanaldehyde formed upon dehydrogenation of 1-propoxy may undergo subsequent dehydrogenation by means of α-H removal leading to the formation of propionyl as shown in Scheme 2. The most stable configuration of propanaldehyde shows a binding energy of −55.2 kJ/mol with α-H closest to the surface at a distance of 2.3 Å as represented in Fig. 1(e). The bond distance of this α-H to the carbon atom is 1.1 Å. The dehydrogenation of propanaldehyde is showing an activation barrier of 70.6 kJ/mol and reaction energy of 35.9 kJ/mol. This is the lowest barrier calculated in the entire dehydrogenation of propanol as represented in Scheme 2. It points towards high possibility of formation of propionyl on the surface of Cu(111) if the initial OH bond scission takes place, which is the step that has the highest activation barrier (Fig. 1(TSab)). Following a study on propanol dehydrogenation over Cu(110), a similar decrease in the dehydrogenation of subsequent abstraction steps was observed as calculated herein [43]. In the transition state, the α-H binds on-top with the surface (Fig. 1(TSef)) while as it binds three-fold in the product state (Fig. 1(f)). The distance between C and α-H increases to 2.3 Å in the transition state. The propionyl species formed in the late transition state as observed in this step, binds two-fold to the surface via the carbonyl carbon atom and a-top via oxygen atom. One of the bonds of α-C atom is with the same Cu bonded to oxygen atom in the transition state (Fig. 1(TSef)). Further, the adsorbed configuration of the propionyl in the product (Fig. 1(f)) shows two-fold binding mode via the carbon of the carbonyl group, and oxygen adsorbs on-top to the Cu(111) surface, however, now both carbon and oxygen bind to different Cu atoms on the surface. Overall, in the NODH of propanol, the dehydrogenation of aldehyde shows the lowest barrier amongst the dehydrogenation steps of propanol whereas the dehydrogenation of 1-propoxy is observed to be the least endothermic. The second dehydrogenation step exhibits activation barrier 13 kJ/mol smaller than that of first, whilst the dehydrogenation of aldehyde is ∼ 8 kJ/mol smaller than the prior one. As compared to the previous dehydrogenation steps, the dehydrogenation of propanaldehyde towards the formation of propionyl is kinetically favourable owing to the least activation energy required. Moreover, if the initial dehydrogenation barrier are overcome at lower temperatures, then the surface may be covered by the propionyl species as the subsequent steps have lower intrinsic activation barriers and slightly lower reaction energy. This increased coverage of the propionyl species will further inhibit the overall reaction rate as all the catalyst sites won’t be available for reaction. In a computational study based on the dehydrogenation of propanol, Alcalá et al. observed the equilibrium rate constant for the dehydrogenation of propanal to be high indicating that the surface coverage by adsorbed propionyl species may well be significant at typical reaction conditions [26]. The likelihood of formation of propionyl species has motivated us to further explore the reaction of propionyl on the surface of Cu(111). The adsorbed intermediates – propionyl may couple with 1-propoxy to form propyl propanoate ester as shown in Scheme 2 which is also observed as a product in experiments conducted on NODH of alcohols [14]. Thus, the formation of ester from the reaction intermediates of NODH of propanol has also been probed. Fig. 3 shows the side view and top view of the adsorption configurations of the reactant, transition state, and product for ester formation. It can be seen that the propionyl binds the surface through carbonyl carbon and 1-propoxy attaches at three-fold site on the surface (Fig. 3(a)). The distance between carbonyl carbon of propionyl and oxygen of 1-propoxy is 4.3 Å in the reactant state. However, the distance reduces to 1.9 Å in the transition state (Fig. 3(TSab)) and further to 1.4 Å in the product state whereby the two finally combine together to form propyl propanoate (Fig. 3(b)). In the transition state, the adsorbed configurations of binding of 1-propoxy and propionyl remains the same, but the carbonyl carbon of propionyl and one of the bonds of oxygen of propoxy now bind with the same Cu atom on the surface. The activation barrier for the esterification reaction is calculated to be 64.6 kJ/mol. In a previous study on ester formation from propoxide and propanal using DFT simulations, the activation barrier was calculated to be 69 kJ/mol, similar to that obtained herein [28]. Moreover, the intrinsic barrier for the ester formation is similar to the dehydrogenation barriers calculated for the previous elementary steps. The esterification reaction, depicted in Fig. 3, is highly exothermic on the terrace sites of Cu, the reaction energy being −105.3 kJ/mol. Previous studies have also shown the reaction step to be exothermic [28,46]. However, the overall reaction of propanol to ester is less endothermic (32.9 kJ/mol) as compared to the formation of propanaldehyde (81.7 kJ/mol). The high exothermicity of the esterification reaction maybe the plausible reason for low aldehyde selectivity observed in the NODH of alcohols [14]. The propyl propanoate (Fig. 3(b)) so formed desorbs from the surface with the desorption energy of 80.7 kJ/mol. As the esterification is the only surface reaction of all reactions shown in Scheme 2 for NODH of propanol that is exothermic, thus making the overall reaction of propanol to ester exothermic, hence there is higher possibility of ester formation at lower temperatures. This explains the low selectivity of the reaction towards the aldehyde product [14]. In order to understand the distinct activity and selectivity trends of secondary alcohols as opposed to that of primary alcohols, the reaction mechanism of dehydrogenation of isopropanol is explored. The first dehydrogenation step is the abstraction of hydrogen from the hydroxyl of isopropanol towards the formation of 2-propoxy. Fig. 4 (a) represents the most stable binding conformation of isopropanol on the surface of Cu. The reactant isopropanol is seen to preferentially adsorb on-top over the Cu(111) surface via the hydroxyl oxygen in η1 configuration. Previous studies reveal similar binding configuration of isopropanol on other transition metals [22,26,40,47]. The OH bond length in the most stable adsorbed configuration is observed to be 1.0 Å (Fig. 4(a)). Binding energy of isopropanol is calculated to be −66.4 kJ/mol, which is similar to that observed in case of primary alcohol. The other binding configurations of isopropanol are shown in Fig. SI-3. The corresponding activation energy of the OH bond dissociation of the secondary alcohol is calculated to be 61.4 kJ/mol, depicted as the first activation barrier in Fig. 5 . Similar activation energy has been determined previously in experiments conducted for dehydrogenation of isopropanol over Cu based catalyst (62.8 kJ/mol) [48]. The transition state for the reaction is shown in Fig. 4(TSab). The dissociated O and H bind separately on the three-fold sites of the Cu (111) surface. The distance between O and H is observed to increase to 2.6 Å in the transition state. The surface reaction energy is found to be 19.6 kJ/mol. The binding configuration of the product 2-propoxy and dissociated hydrogen resembles the transition state. The 2-propoxy so formed upon initial dehydrogenation of isopropanol binds three-fold via carbonyl oxygen. The hydrogen atom also binds three-fold to the surface as can be seen from Fig. 4(b). The distance between the O and H atoms increases to 3.2 Å, as depicted in Fig. 4(b). The dehydrogenation barrier of isopropanol is 35 kJ/mol lower than that of propanol hinting towards higher rate of initial OH dissociation of secondary alcohol as opposed to primary alcohol (Figs. 1 and 4). This finding corroborates the trend observed experimentally, wherein the conversion of primary alcohol (19 %) is much lower than that of secondary alcohol (98 %) on Cu catalysts [14]. Moreover, the OH bond activation on primary alcohol is more endothermic than secondary alcohol. Thus, at lower temperatures, there is a higher possibility of dehydrogenation of isopropanol than that of propanol. The 2-propoxy species binding at the three-fold sites of Cu (111) surface may further dehydrogenate by means of α-H abstraction from the carbonyl carbon forming acetone as depicted in Scheme 2. The activation barrier is calculated to be 51.3 kJ/mol with the C–H bond distance increasing from 1 Å to 1.2 Å in the reactant and transition state, respectively (Fig. 4(c) and 4(TScd)). The activation barrier is slightly lower than the initial dehydrogenation step with a difference of ∼ 10 kJ/mol. Thus, at reaction conditions, if the reaction undergoes first activation barrier, it is likely to overcome the subsequent dehydrogenation of 2-propoxy. Similar decrease in the activation barrier between first and second dehydrogenation step is also observed in case of primary alcohol. The binding mode of carbon oxygen changes from three-fold in 2-propoxy to one-fold in the transition state. Further, the α-H bends towards the surface and binds on-top to the Cu surface, as depicted in Fig. 4(TScd). The bond finally breaks down forming acetone which binds on-top via carbonyl O to the surface. The hydrogen atom binds three-fold on Cu (111). The C–H distance in the product state is 3.1 Å (Fig. 4(d)). It is noted that the bonding mode of the carbonyl CO bond changed from σ-bond (single bond) in the reactant to π-bond (double bond) in the product state. The reaction is endothermic with the energy of reaction (20 kJ/mol) comparable to the initial dehydrogenation step. Acetone so formed may desorb with a desorption energy of 51.2 kJ/mol (Fig. 5). The desorption energy of acetone is similar to that observed in case of primary alcohol for the desorption of propanaldehyde. The formation of H2 gas upon NODH of isopropanol is marked in blue color in Fig. 5. The activation barrier and reaction energy are observed to be 52.8 and 31.9 kJ/mol, respectively. Noteworthy to mention here is that the reaction energy diagram constructed in Figs. 2 and 5 is based on the DFT energies and thus does not include the temperature and entropy effects. Surface reactions are generally not affected by the inclusion of temperature and entropic effects, however, the overall reaction energy diagram does changes due to their effect on adsorption and desorption processes [49]. Fig. SI-4 shows the reaction energy diagram for dehydrogenation of propanol (Fig. SI-4(a)) and isopropanol (Fig. SI-4(b)) wherein the effect of entropy of gas phase species at a reaction temperature of 423 K is incorporated. It can be seen that the activation barriers remains the same for surface reaction steps, whereas it is the adsorption and desorption energies which are altered by the addition of entropic effects. In the dehydrogenation of isopropanol in oxidant free environment explored so far, it is the abstraction of the hydroxyl H and α-H dehydrogenation steps that have been studied, thus leaving the secondary alcohol with no further α-H to lose as opposed to the case of primary alcohol (propanol) wherein there are two α-Hs. In order to understand the dehydrogenation step for isopropanol corresponding to the abstraction of second α-H of propanol, the β-H dehydrogenation step is investigated. Acetone on Cu(111) surface may further undergo dehydrogenation of β-H towards the formation of 2-oxy propyl. Of the β-H atoms, the hydrogen that is tilted towards the surface is the closest to the Cu atoms. It is at a distance of 2.7 Å from the surface. The C–H bond distance in adsorbed acetone is 1.1 Å. The binding energy of acetone is 13.9 kJ/mol, shown in Fig. 6 (a). The activation barrier for the dehydrogenation from β position is calculated to be 112.8 kJ/mol, which is the highest barrier reported of all the dehydrogenation steps in the NODH of isopropanol. In the transition state, the hydrogen dissociates from the β-C position, sitting on a three-fold site on the surface of Cu (Fig. 6(TSab)). The C–H distance increases to 2 Å (Fig. 6(TSab)). The π-bond of the acetone reactant changes to π-bond configuration between carbonyl C and β-C wherefrom the hydrogen is abstracted. The O continues to bind on-top to the surface. The thermodynamics of the formation of 2-oxy propyl from acetone dehydrogenation are highly endothermic, thus suggesting the low possibility of the further dehydrogenation of acetone. Such a high barrier could be due to the high stability of acetone which dissociates in this reaction step. The activation barrier of this dehydrogenation step (112.8 kJ/mol) is much higher as compared to the binding energy of 1-oxy propyl (−6.8 kJ/mol), thus acetone is likely to desorb from the surface rather than undergo dehydrogenation. Furthermore, the reaction energy of the step is calculated to be 36.6 kJ/mol, which is the most endothermic of all the three dehydrogenation steps of isopropanol. In the product so formed, the C–H bond distance increases to 3.1 Å. The binding configuration of 2-oxy propyl is shown in Fig. 6(b). The oxygen and β-C bind one-fold to the surface whereas the carbonyl carbon binds two-fold. It is also shown in Fig. 5. This precisely is the most contrasting trend in barrier obtained between the primary and secondary alcohol. For propanol, the dehydrogenation barrier of third step (70.6 kJ/mol) is the least amongst all dehydrogenation steps explored whereas for isopropanol the barrier is calculated to be largest of all (Figs. 2 and 6). It suggests towards the high product selectivity observed in case of secondary alcohol as opposed to primary alcohol wherein the activation energy for dehydrogenation of propionyl (51 kJ/mol) is the smallest. A similar high activation barrier for formation of 2-oxy propyl as opposed to propionyl is reported by Basaran et al. in the study of dehydrogenation of propanol and isopropanol over Pt(111) surface [22]. Furthermore, Bader charge analysis is conducted to understand the difference in behaviour of the third dehydrogenation step and is shown in Fig. SI-5. Due to the presence of electron withdrawing O atom attached to the α-carbon in case of primary alcohol, the α-C–H bond is activated as can be seen from the charge separation (C (1.619), H(0.005)), shown in Fig. SI-5(a), as calculated using Bader charge analysis. The charge separation in the C–H bond, results in easy dissociation of C–H bond and thus exhibits low barrier for activation (70.6 kJ/mol). The presence of the electron withdrawing O atom also stabilizes extra electron in the C atom (1.351) in the product state (Fig. SI-5(c)). On the contrary, for the secondary alcohol, the H is abstracted from the β-carbon, where there is minimal charge separation in the C–H bond (C(−0.019), H(0.037)), depicted in Fig. SI-5(d). The sp3 nature of the alkyl CH3 group makes the C–H bond highly stable causing the C–H bond dissociation difficult and hence resulting in high activation barrier (112.8 kJ/mol). In the transition state for primary alcohol (Fig. SI-5(b)), it can be seen that the charge of oxygen increases (−1.83) as it is withdrawing the charge and thus stabilizing the extra electron in the α-C atom. This stabilization of transition state is not observed in case of secondary alcohol (Fig. SI-5(e)). Table 1 summarises the activation barriers and reaction energy of the dehydrogenation reactions of primary alcohol, propanol as well as secondary alcohol, isopropanol over the terrace sites of Cu. It is clearly evident that the activation barriers for dehydrogenation of propanol are higher than that calculated for isopropanol suggesting towards higher conversion rates for isopropanol as have been observed in previous experimental studies based on primary and secondary alcohols [17]. However, the dehydrogenation of the ketone so formed shows a much higher barrier (112.8 kJ/mol) as compared to that of aldehyde (70.6 kJ/mol). This may be attributable to the fact that ketones are more stable and the dehydrogenation of acetone entails the removal of β-H whereas that of acetaldehyde involves the abstraction of α-H."
3,Conclusions,"Activity and selectivity trends for NODH of primary and secondary alcohols is explored computationally. First principle DFT simulations are conducted to study the dehydrogenation of propanol and isopropanol over terrace sites of Cu to gain mechanistic insights into the dissimilar reactivity patterns. The dehydrogenation barriers for the initial dehydrogenation of hydroxyl and subsequent abstraction of hydrogen from α carbon for propanol are calculated to be higher as compared to that of isopropanol. This is in line with the experimental observation of higher conversion of secondary alcohol as compared to that of primary alcohol over Cu catalysts [14]. The elementary steps in the NODH of propanol are more endothermic as compared to isopropanol, which further corroborates the observation. Further, the third dehydrogenation step of propanol towards the formation of propionyl from propanaldehdye shows the lowest barrier of all the dehydrogenation steps explored. The propionyl may form an ester upon reacting with 1-propoxy species. The reaction is observed to be highly exothermic, thus resulting in the possibility of higher conversions towards the formation of ester. This validates the low selectivity of aldehyde observed in the experiments of NODH of primary alcohols. The dehydrogenation of acetone shows a very high barrier indicating that the surface reaction is highly improbable and the acetone will desorb from the surface, resulting in high selectivity towards the ketone product. Overall, the study explains the contrasting activity and selectivity trends observed in the NODH of primary and secondary alcohols."
