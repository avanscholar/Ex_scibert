0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a clean oxidant in terms of (i) formation of nontoxic byproducts, (ii) ease of handling, (iii) operation in a wide pH range, and (iv) utilization as Fenton reagent to generate ·OH radicals with strong oxidation power [1]. H2O2 has been widely utilized, and its demand is continuously increasing in various industries, especially for the bleaching of recycled pulp and paper, chemical synthesis, and the treatment of wastewater [1,2]. H2O2 is commercially produced via the anthraquinone (AQ) method, involving the sequential hydrogenation of alkyl-AQ in the presence of Pd catalysts and oxidation of the resultant alkyl-anthrahydroquinone (AHQ) (Fig. 1 ). The disadvantages of the AQ method are: (i) the utilization of organic solvents and noble metal catalysts, (ii) the feed of explosive H2 gas, (iii) the treatment of waste solvents, and (iv) the high energy input induced by the high temperature and pressure. Therefore, the development of a new cost-effective and the environmentally benign process is essential. H2O2 production via a direct reaction between H2 and O2 over heterogeneous catalysts (Pd, Pt, Au, Pd-Au, and Pd-Pt alloys) and electrochemical H2O2 production are apparently good alternatives for the conventional AQ method [3,4]. However, the former requires noble metal catalysts and H2 gas as a reactant [4], and the latter operates under alkaline conditions that accelerate the decomposition of H2O2 [3]. In this regard, the photocatalytic production of H2O2 emerges as the most promising candidate because water is utilized as not only a hydrogen source but also a solvent, and there is no need for any noble metals and extra energy (i.e., high temperature/pressure, electricity, etc.). Since Baur et al. reported H2O2 production over ZnO catalyst in the presence of glycerin and glucose under illumination in 1927 [5], related mechanistic studies have been actively conducted, focusing on H2O2 as a byproduct generated from the photocatalytic remediation of pollutants. For example, Kormann et al. reported the effect of using organic electron donors (acetate and isopropanol) on the production of H2O2 in TiO2- and ZnO-based photocatalytic systems [6]. In the absence of electron donors, only traces of H2O2 were formed. However, the quantum yield of H2O2 was significantly improved by adding electron donors due to the participation of more electrons in O2 reduction. Instead of a continuous increase of the H2O2 concentration, the H2O2 production was saturated due to its decomposition mainly induced by electrons (eqn. 1), holes (eqn. 2), and complexation with the TiO2 surface (eqn. 3), which should be overcome to produce large amounts of H2O2 [6–8]. (1) H2O2 + e− → OH + OH− (2) H2O2 + 2h+→ O2 + 2H+ (3) (≡TiIV−OH)surf + H2O2→ (≡TiIV−OOH)surf + H2O H2O2 decomposition can be effectively retarded by the surface passivation of TiO2 using anions like fluoride, carbonate, and phosphate [9–11]. Very recently, we reported that phosphate-modified reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/TiO2 efficiently suppressed H2O2 decomposition by preventing the complexation with TiO2 surface and the charge transfer to H2O2 [11]. Although diverse photocatalytic systems, including TiO2 modified with Cu2+ ions, copper porphyrin, Au and Au-Ag alloy [12–14], CdS-graphene [15], Ca2Nb3O10 [16], and Au/BiVO4 [17], have been designed to improve H2O2 production, most of these photocatalysts are not visible-light-active and have low quantum efficiency in the absence of noble metal co-catalysts and electron donors [18–21]. Polymeric carbon nitride (C3N4), consisting of earth-abundant elements only, is an ideal photocatalyst for H2O2 production because its conduction band (−1.3 V vs. NHE) is suitably located to facilitate O2 reduction (−0.28 V vs. NHE) and its lower valence band potential (1.4 V vs. NHE) than that of metal oxides can prevent the oxidative decomposition of H2O2 (eqn. 3) [19,20]. Moreover, the bandgap of C3N4 is easily modulated by doping or complexation, resulting in effective utilization of visible light [22]. In this minireview, we have mainly focused on recent advances and challenges associated with C3N4-based photocatalytic H2O2 production. The fabrication of C3N4, the mechanism of H2O2 production over C3N4, and the strategies including structuring tailoring, surface modifications, and hybridizing with secondary materials to optimize photocatalytic efficiency have been described in detail."
1,Materials synthesis and H2O2 production mechanism over C3N4,"C3N4 can be easily synthesized by thermal condensation of nitrogen-rich carbon precursors like urea, thiourea, cyanamide, dicyandiamide, and melamine [23]. This process is composed of polyaddition and polycondensation, involving the formation of various intermediates as a function of the heating temperature (Fig. 2 ) [24]. First, cyanamide undergoes condensation to produce dicyandiamide and melamine sequentially, and melamine is re-arranged to form tri-s-triazine, which finally gives polymerized C3N4 at ∼520 °C [23]. The C3N4 obtained by thermal condensation has a bulk structure, but individual C3N4 sheets can be prepared by thermal etching or liquid exfoliation. Ultrathin C3N4 sheets with the high surface area and superior interfacial charge transfer properties are quite favorable toward effective photocatalysis [25,26]. Shiraishi et al. reported the special features of C3N4 structure that promote photocatalytic H2O2 production under visible light irradiation, in which the selectivity to H2O2 was recorded as ∼90% in the presence of ethanol as a sacrificial donor [20]. Raman spectroscopic and electron spin resonance (ESR) investigations revealed that the tri-s-triazine moieties in the C3N4 polymeric matrix are favorable for selective two-electron transfer to O2 due to the sequential formation of a superoxo radical and a 1,4-endoperoxide species (Fig. 3 ) [20,27]. Notably, two electrons and two protons are required to produce H2O2 (eqn. 4) because four-electron transfer to O2 promotes the formation of water (eqn. 5, typically known as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cells) [27]. Because of the valence band position, H2O2 production via the recombination of hydroxyl radicals (eqn. 6) can be ruled out. Shiraishi’s outstanding study on the selective two-electron reduction of O2 over C3N4 has opened new opportunities to explore C3N4-based hybrid structures for solar-light-driven H2O2 production [20].

2,Structural and surface modification of C3N4,
3,Morphology control,"3.1 Morphology control The use of polymerized C3N4 for photocatalytic H2O2 production is still facing some critical problems, including low surface area, limited visible-light absorption, high recombination of charge carriers, and inefficient water oxidation capability [21,26]. For solar-light-driven H2O2 production using C3N4 photocatalysts, architecture engineering such as controlling of the specific surface area, porosity, and dimensions can greatly influence photocatalytic performance. Ou et al. demonstrated that the designed C3N4 aerogel having 3-dimensional (3-D) network effectively increases photocatalytic activity [28]. Self-assembled C3N4 initially produced a hydrogel, which was then freeze-dried to obtain the C3N4 aerogel network (Fig. 4 ). Transformation of C3N4 particles into the aerogel structure provided a significant improvement in solar-light-driven H2O2 production under visible light illumination, yielding 36 μmole of H2O2 after 25 h of reaction compared to trace amount of H2O2 generated over bare C3N4. Such significant improvement in photocatalytic activity was mainly because of the combination of the high internal surface area (133 m2/g compared to 7 m2/g) and porous structure, accelerating the rates of H2O2 production and reactant and product transport, thereby minimizing the mass transfer limitation. Similarly, mesoporous C3N4 with the large specific surface area was applied for photocatalytic H2O2 production in the presence of ethanol as a sacrificial donor by Shiraishi et al [27]. Use of hard templates (e.g. SiO2 particles, polystyrene beads, etc.) is an effective method to produce hierarchically structured nanomaterials with many structural benefits including high surface area, controllable pore structure, and charge carrier diffusion length. Shiraishi et al. adopted this approach to prepare mesoporous C3N4 by thermal polymerization of cyanamide using SiO2 nanoparticles as a hard template (Fig. 5 a). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of mesoporous C3N4 was adjusted to 56 m2/g, 160 m2/g, and 228 m2/g by simply increasing the weight of the silica template. Although the large surface area is generally beneficial for high photocatalytic activity, the photocatalytic H2O2 generation was not proportional to the surface area (Figs. 5 b-d). Mesoporous C3N4 sheets prepared using SiO2 template provide high surface area and a large number of primary amine moieties as surface defects, which are responsible for promoting four-electron transfer to O2, thereby hampering selective H2O2 production by 2-electron transfer reaction. They also observed that mesoporous C3N4 with a large number of primary amine moieties also act as active sites to promote photodecomposition of the produced H2O2."
4,Doping of hetero-elements into C3N4,"3.2 Doping of hetero-elements into C3N4 One effective approach to control the bandgap and efficiency of photocatalysts is to incorporate hetero-elements into the photocatalyst structure. In fact, various dopants have been introduced to the C3N4 structure during its synthesis to improve the H2O2 yield. For example, we introduced the earth-abundant elements potassium (K), phosphorous (P), and oxygen (O) to the C3N4 structure by adding dibasic potassium phosphate, KPD (K2HPO4), during the thermal condensation of melamine [29]. In-situ incorporation of multiple elements into C3N4 significantly improved H2O2 production with a 25-times higher apparent quantum yield (AQY, Φ) than bare C3N4 under monochromatic radiation in the presence of ethanol (Φ420nm = 8.0% for hetero-elements-doped C3N4 and Φ420nm = 0.32% for bare C3N4) (Fig. 6 ). The phosphate species in KPD-doped C3N4 provided not only the negative surface charge in the entire pH range, which is beneficial for H2O2 production as a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction, but also retarded the photodecomposition of H2O2, which is in line with our previous findings on the suppressed photodecomposition of H2O2 over phosphate-modified rGO/TiO2 composites [11]. Moreover, charge carrier dynamics obtained by time-resolved spectroscopy revealed that the recombination rate of charge carriers were effectively reduced by incorporation of KPD to C3N4. The successful doping of multiple elements into C3N4 was also demonstrated by Kim et al [30]. In this study, K+ and PF6 − were introduced into the C3N4 network instead of K, P, and O by KPD, via thermal condensation of melamine with potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6). Modification by KPF6 not only improved the absorption capability in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 450 nm but also promoted the PCET reaction, as supported by the rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements (Fig. 7 ). The electron transfer numbers of KPF6-doped C3N4 and bare C3N4 were 2.01 and 2.53, respectively, obtained from the slope of Koutecky-Levich (KL) plots, indicating that KPF6-doped C3N4 has a higher selectivity for two-electron transfer to O2."
5,Surface modification of C3N4,"3.3 Surface modification of C3N4 Surface engineering to create non-stoichiometric atomic structures (or surface defects) is a versatile approach to improve the light absorption and efficiency of photocatalysts. Various research groups have studied the carbon or nitrogen vacancies in C3N4 and exploited their impact on photocatalytic H2O2 production. Li et al. demonstrated that the presence of carbon vacancies promotes the photocatalytic activity of C3N4 under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Carbon vacancies were created in C3N4 via thermal annealing (520 °C) in the oxygen-deficient environment (Ar flow). During heat treatment under Ar, some of the carbon atoms were sputtered from the surface to form a vacancy, as confirmed by the reduced C/N ratio obtained from the elemental analysis. Carbon vacancies created in C3N4 indeed promoted the photocatalytic H2O2 generation by a factor of 14 in the absence of sacrificial donors (Fig. 8 ). The proposed mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic activity is that the carbon vacancies can alter the H2O2 production pathway from a two-step indirect reaction (sequential single-electron transfer) to a one-step direct reaction (two-electron transfer) [31]. Chemical-reagent-induced nitrogen vacancies in C3N4 also showed the similar trend. Zhu et al. prepared C3N4 with nitrogen vacancies via thermal treatment in the presence of a chemical reducing agent (NaBH4) [32], which produced nitride vacancies from the tertiary nitride (N1) sites and CN groups from the pyridine nitride (N2) sites as the main nitrogen defects (Fig. 9 ). Thus-produced nitrogen vacancies lower the bandgap energy and lead to a positive shift in both valence band and conduction band edges, thus providing improved light absorption and charge carrier separation. Moreover, the formation of nitride vacancies can promote the two-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to produce H2O2, as supported by RDE measurements. Similarly, Shi et al. have introduced a hydrazine-based photoreduction method to create holey defective C3N4 containing nitrogen vacancies [33]. In this study, C3N4 was modified simultaneously by vacancy generation and structural deformation, affording enhanced absorption capability, suppressed charge carrier recombination, and better reactant diffusion. Therefore, holey defective C3N4 with optimum nitrogen vacancies exhibited significantly improved photocatalytic H2O2 production compared to bare C3N4 (Fig. 10 )."
6,C3N4-based heterostructures,"3.4 C3N4-based heterostructures Formation of heterostructures has been frequently used for promoting light absorption, charge pair separation, and the specific selectivity, and thereby improving the overall photocatalytic activity. Recently, many attempts have been made to substitute various aromatic molecules into the C3N4 network for boosting photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. Modification strategies involve either copolymerization during the synthesis of C3N4 or post-synthesis modification of C3N4. Kim et al. demonstrated the successful synthesis of C3N4 substituted with benzene moieties, where the nitrogen atoms of tertiary amines are substituted with benzene ring moieties, by the copolymerization of urea as the main precursor and trimesic acid as a co-monomer of benzene source [34]. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that the introduction of benzene ring distorts the planar symmetry of the C3N4 structure (Fig. 11 ). Such distortion is responsible for the enhanced separation of charge carriers, as confirmed by the reduced photoluminescence (PL) emission intensity. Recently, Shiraishi et al. reported a series of diimide-substituted C3N4 for effective solar-light-driven H2O2 production. Pyromellitic diimide (PDI)-incorporated C3N4 (PDI/C3N4) was synthesized via thermal condensation of PDI and melem [21]. Low photocatalytic H2O2 production over C3N4 photocatalyts without sacrificial donors is thought to be mainly due to the valence band potential being insufficient for oxidizing water to form molecular oxygen as the rate determining step. Incorporation of PDI with high electron affinity into the C3N4 network led to narrow bandgap energy and positively shifted band-edge potentials (Fig. 12 ). Consequently, PDI/C3N4 can fulfill the requirements of successful solar-light-driven H2O2 production by simultaneous molecular oxygen reduction and water oxidation, resulting in 250-fold higher H2O2 evolution activity (50.6 μmol) than that of bare C3N4 (<0.2 μmol) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) in the absence of sacrificial donors. Other diimide moieties can be employed as substituents in the C3N4 network for enhancing charge separation and intra- and inter-structure charge transportation. Photocatalytic H2O2 production activity of bi-phenyl-diimide (BDI)-incorporated C3N4 was higher in terms of AQY (Φ420nm = 4.6%) than that of PDI/C3N4 (Φ420nm = 2.6%). [35] The enhanced H2O2 yield is ascribed to retarded charge carrier recombination because the produced electron and hole carriers in C3N4/BDI are separately localized on the melem units and the BDI moieties, respectively (Fig. 13 a). The spatial charge separation of electrons and holes, where the e− exists on the melem and the h+ is located on the BDI unit, was confirmed using Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Recently, Kofuji et al. modified C3N4 with mellitic triimide (MTI) via thermal condensation of melam and mellitic acid anhydride [36]. Incorporation of three-directional MTI and melem units created a condensed layered structure with high electrical conductivity and efficient charge carrier separation, providing high solar-to-chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 0.18%, comparable to that of the best-known catalyst for overall water splitting. The improved conductivity and charge carrier separation on C3N4/MTI is ascribed to the enhanced intra- and inter-layer transportation of the photogenerated charge carriers through the condensed layered structure (Fig. 13b). A proper combination of semiconductor-based heterostructures according to their band energy positions can enhance the absorption ability and charge carrier separation via cascadal electron transfer. A solid-state Z-scheme heterojunction comprising perylene imides (PI) and C3N4 was successfully demonstrated by Yang et al. (Fig. 14 ) [37]. C3N4/PI can promote the spatial separation of charge carriers through a Z-scheme configuration, in which photoinduced electrons in PI recombine with holes in C3N4, while the remaining holes and electrons in PI and C3N4, respectively, are responsible for the generation of H2O2 via O2 reduction and water oxidation. Particularly, it was proposed that the valence band holes in PI first oxidize OH− ions to ·OH radicals, which further react with other ·OH radicals to form H2O2. The C3N4/CuO hybrid prepared through the molten salt-assisted microwave process also showed a significant improvement on the photocatalytic H2O2 production by forming a Z-scheme configuration. [38] Zhao et al. reported the strategy of using covalently attached polyoxometalate (POM) cluster of [PW11O39]-7(PW11) on C3N4 for solar-light-driven H2O2 production [39]. As a homogeneous photocatalyst, POM can play the role of functional catalysts in various chemical reactions as itself or as a hybrid [40–42]. The H2O2 production rate over C3N4-PW11 (3.5 μmol h-1) was much higher than bare C3N4 (1.3 μmol h-1). In a C3N4-PW11 hybrid, the POM cluster plays a key role as an active light absorber and a redox mediator to improve photocatalytic H2O2 production. EPR and RDE analyses revealed that the coupling of C3N4 and PW11 promoted the two-electron reduction of O2 through the transformed electronic structure. Similarly, an earth-abundant mixed metal oxide (MMO), prepared from NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH), exhibited significant improvement in photocatalytic activity when combined with C3N4 [43]. The C3N4/MMO composite was beneficial for water oxidation and ORR, enabling H2O2 production without the use of sacrificial donors. Similar to other studies on C3N4-based heterostructures, it was confirmed that tuning of band energy potential by the hybridization with MMO is a key step in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of C3N4. Black phosphorous (BP) is an emerging 2D material for solar energy conversion and has a tunable bandgap based on layered thickness. Zheng et al. reported the preparation of BP/C3N4 composite and its possible application for a photocatalytic H2O2 generation [44]. A proper band structure in the BP/C3N4 composite is responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activities, including dye degradation induced by the improved superoxide radical (·O2 −) generation and H2O2 production through the accelerated sequential two-step reaction initiated by ·O2 − formation. The H2O2 production yield of 10% BP/C3N4 in the presence of isopropanol was ∼540 μmolg-1 h-1, much higher than that obtained using bare C3N4 (360 μmolg-1 h-1) and bare BP (380 μmolg-1 h-1) (Fig. 15 ). As a similar approach, CoP nanoparticles loaded on C3N4 could effectively reduce intrinsic charge recombination of C3N4 and increase the H2O2 production activity up to 4.6 times compared to bare C3N4 [45]. The loading of co-catalysts, to maximize the selectivity of two-electron O2 reduction and to minimize the overpotential for both reduction and oxidation reactions, has also been actively studied. Kofuji et al. investigated the critical influence of rGO as a co-catalyst in a C3N4/PDI/rGO composite [18]. In this configuration, the role of rGO is to accept photoexcited electrons from C3N4/PDI and transfer the same to O2. Therefore, ORR takes place on the rGO surface, whereas water oxidation occurs on C3N4/PDI. C3N4/PDI/rGO exhibited SCC efficiency of 0.2% for H2O2 production. He et al. recently reported a 2-D hybrid photocatalyst (CBN) based on the combination of C3N4 and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) [46], which shows high activity for photocatalytic H2 production via water splitting reaction and less activity for H2O2 evolution. In contrast, multi-hybridization of boron nitride (BN) and C3N4/PDI/rGO exhibited significantly improved photocatalytic H2O2 production. [47] In a multi-hybrid C3N4/PDI‐BN‐rGO, conduction band electrons in C3N4/PDI are efficiently transferred to rGO for two-electron O2 reduction to produce H2O2, whereas the holes in C3N4/PDI migrate to BN, which acts as a hole acceptor. Thus, oxidation and reduction centers in C3N4/PDI‐BN‐rGO are separated, leading to retarded charge recombination. Therefore, H2O2 production was accelerated using C3N4/PDI-BN0.2-rGO0.05 with an AQY (Φ420nm) of 7.3% (Fig. 16 ). Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been frequently used as conducting support for energy conversion and storage devices. Zhao et al. investigated CNTs covalently attached on C3N4 for photocatalytic H2O2 production in the presence of formic acid as a sacrificial donor [48]. The strong interaction between CNT and C3N4 causes a negative shift of the conduction band by 0.34 V compared to bare C3N4, which is favorable for single-electron reduction of O2 to initiate the sequential two-step H2O2 synthesis. We have recently exploited anthraquinone (AQ)-augmented polymeric C3N4 by anchoring AQ on the surface of C3N4 [49]. AQ-augmented C3N4 has shown an 8.3-fold increase in AQY (Φ = 19.5%) at 380 nm compared to bare CN in the presence of isopropanol as a sacrificial donor (Fig. 17 ) [49]. AQ as a metal-free co-catalyst not only enhances charge pair separation by withdrawing excited electrons from C3N4 but also facilitates two-electron reduction of O2 for effective H2O2 production via anthrahydroquinone (AQH2) formation and subsequent dehydrogenation of AQH2 back to AQ. In comparison to AQ, the loading of carbon-based co-catalysts such as C60, GO, and rGO on C3N4 has a relatively minor effect on the yield of H2O2, indicating that AQ chemistry has played a key role in the selective two-electron reduction to produce H2O2 under solar irradiation."
7,Summary and outlook,"The C3N4 and its modified forms are easily synthesized by thermal condensation of nitrogen-rich carbon precursors. The C3N4 structure has the unique property to produce H2O2 because the tri-s-triazine moieties facilitate selective two-electron transfer to O2 via sequential formation of a superoxo radical and 1,4-endoperoxide species under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic H2O2 production is cost-effective and environmentally benign and can be eligible for wastewater treatments as a precursor to producing hydroxyl radicals and for fuel cell applications as an alternative liquid fuel with high energy density. In this minireview, we overviewed the literature on the various strategies to improve H2O2 production in C3N4-based photocatalytic systems. Morphology control, hetero-elements doping, surface modification, and hybridization of C3N4 significantly enhance both yield and selectivity toward H2O2 production in terms of (i) increased specific surface area, (ii) high oxygen affinity, (iii) effective charge separation, (iv) acceleration of proton-coupled electron transfer, (v) prolonged trapped charge carrier, (vi) retardation of H2O2 decomposition, etc. Although the photocatalytic activity is quite low in the absence of aliphatic alcohols as an electron donor, they can be replaced by aquatic organic pollutants. Furthermore, scaling up of H2O2 production can be realized by the development of new materials and system engineering, implying that there is significant scope for the optimization of this method."
