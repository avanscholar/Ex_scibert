0,Introduction,"Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), a representative water treatment method for chemically degrading various organic and inorganic compounds in water, have been studied extensively in environmental research. AOPs are an effective method for treating pharmaceutical chemicals, pesticides, dyes, organic compounds in landfill leachate, soil contaminants, and nonbiodegradable materials in wastewater treatment [1–3]. Most studies on AOPs have used such chemicals as H2O2, O3, and persulfate with ultraviolet (UV) light to initiate the production of powerful oxidizing agents, such as hydroxyl radicals and persulfate radicals, which are important in degrading environmental pollutants [4–7]. Also, peroxone and photocatalytic process for the degradation of low molecular weight (LMW) compounds and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were reported by many researchers [8–14]. There were innovative and promising AOP associated with cavitation and peroxymonosulfate activation reviewer [15–19]. On the other hand, an alternative AOP with no chemical injection to produce OH radicals has been recently examined with regard to drinking water treatment and ultrapure water (UPW) production process: the photoinitiated AOP [20–23]. In the photoinitiated AOP, water molecules that are irradiated by UV light between 140 and 190 nm, termed vacuum UV (VUV), is split into a hydrogen radical and OH radical, which are used in the degradation of organic compounds [20]. The main light source for UV photolysis in water treatment is a low-pressure mercury vapor lamp, which emits primarily at 254 nm and 185 nm, the latter of which initiates the photolysis of water (Eq. 1) [24]. (1) H 2 O → h ν 185 n m H O ∙ + H ∙ The effectiveness of 185-nm UV (VUV) in degrading organic compounds has been reported by several studies that have compared AOP and photoinduced AOP. Han et al. [25] conducted a study to degrad p-chlorobenzoic acid (p-CBA) in aqueous solution with TiO2 at 254 nm, TiO2 at 185 nm, and 185-nm light alone, wherein the rate constant of p-CBA degradation by 185-nm UV was similar to that with TiO2 at 185 nm and almost three times higher than with TiO2 at 254 nm. Similarly, in a comparison of oxidation between UV/H2O2 and VUV (185 nm) by Lopez et al. [26] and Imoberdorf and Mohseni [27], VUV had fast degradation kinetics in the breakdown of 4-chloro-3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid and natural organic matter (NOM) compared with UV/H2O2. Irradiation with 185-nm UV light is a potential treatment method for degrading water contaminants, such as natural organic matter, aliphatic and chlorinated volatile organic compounds, aromatic compounds, herbicides, and pharmaceutical waste [24]. The photodegradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), a herbicide, by VUV using a batch reactor was reported by Imoberdorf and Mohseni [28], in which 98 % of 2,4-D (5 mg/L) was removed within 10 min, although the removal efficiency was inversely affected by the presence of OH scavengers, such as NOM, and by alkalinity in the treatment of raw surface water. Krakkó et al. [29] applied photodegradation to diclofenac (DICL), naproxen (NAPR), and carbamazepine (CARB), which are pharmaceutical residues that appear frequently in water bodies, using 185-nm UV light. These chemicals spiked in UPW and municipal wastewater were completely degraded within 2 min and 10 min, respectively. Further, 185-nm UV light degraded chlorinated hydrocarbons. Chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and 1,1,2-trichloroehtnae were broken down by VUV in the absence of dissolved oxygen, and a nearly corresponding stoichiometric amount of chloride was observed as reaction byproducts [30]. The commercial-scale application of photoinitiated AOP has been implemented primarily as a unit process of UPW production facility in semiconductor, power plant, and pharmaceutical industries, because of the advantage of not using any chemicals. In UPW production facilities, a unit process using 185-nm UV light, termed TOC reduction UV, is located after reverse osmosis (RO) and mediates the oxidation of organic compounds in solution to minimize the total organic concentration (TOC) in UPW as much as possible [20]. Organic compounds found in feed solution of TOC reduction UV are known as LMW substances with molecular weights less than 100. To this end, the degradation of these organic matters by 185-nm UV has been examined [31,32]. Also, LMW compounds such as alcohol have been known as a radical scavenger in AOP studies [8,33,34]. However, previous studies on photoinitiated AOP have performed batch-type experiments [31–34]. These results can be not introduced to the design of actual facilities. Because UV exposure times in actual facilities are normally below 10 min, it is necessary to conduct a research at the condition which is simulating the operating condition of TOC reduction UV at UPW production facility. This works presents the degradation and intermediate byproducts characteristics of six chemicals by 185-nm UV irradiation using a continuously operated column reactor. The authors have constructed a lab-scale TOC reduction UV test equipment which was similar in structure to the commercial UPW production process and are focused on researches to find the mechanism for removing organic matter (methanol and IPA) from the TOC reconstruction UV and the important operational factors [35]. In order to optimize the design and operational factor of TOC reduction UV unit, it is necessary to investigate removal efficiencies of various organic compounds observed frequently in the influent of TOC reduction UV and byproducts formed in the degradation process. The object of this study was to examine the degradation of six chemicals—methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), acetone, and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)—by 185-nm UV irradiation using a continuously operated column reactor. A TOC analyzer and GC–MS were used to measure the TOC removal efficiency of each chemical and characterize the intermediate byproducts that were generated from the UV irradiation. Further, the function of ion exchange (IX) located after the TOC reduction UV in UPW production facility was evaluated. Finally, experiments were conducted in three different initial concentrations to provide useful engineering data for estimating removal efficiencies of LMW organic compounds in the design of a TOC reduction UV unit."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The chemicals that were used in this study were methanol (≥ 99.8 % Junsei), ethanol (≥ 99.8 %, Sigma-Aldrich), acetaldehyde (≥ 99.5 %, Sigma-Aldrich), IPA (≥ 99.7 %, Junsei), acetone (≥ 99.5 %, Junsei), and MEK (≥ 99.0 %+, Junsei). The quality of deionized water (DIW), prepared in a UPW production system that was operated in the authors’ facility, was as follows: TOC < 1 μg/L, resistivity >18.2 MΩ cm, dissolved oxygen < 1 μg/L, and dissolved CO2 < 1 μg/L."
3,Apparatus,"2.2 Apparatus The photodegradation of LMW organic compounds by 185 nm UV irradiation was studied using a continuously operated column reactor that was proven to be the effective setup in the author’s previous study [35]. A schematic of the test equipment is shown in Fig. 1 . The UV irradiation reactor was composed of SUS 316, and its total volume was 0.74 L. Four baffles were installed inside of the column at uniform intervals to ensure complete mixing at the flow rate of the experiment. One lamp (FNS Tech, 21 W) and a synthetic quartz sleeve (25 mm in diameter and 30 mm in length) were installed in the center of the UV reactor. The transparency of the quartz sleeve to 185-nm UV irradiation, as measured at its surface with a UV power meter, was 80 % (C8026, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). The DIW produced in UPW production system was supplied to the UV reactor by a magnetic booster pump (IWAKI, MD40-RAM), and its flow rate was fixed at 1.5 L/min. Each chemical stock solution of LMW organic compounds was injected continuously into the line between the feed pump and the UV reactor using a piston pump (FLOM, Al-10), and its flow rate was varied from 0.3 mL/min to 1 mL/min. The chemical concentration was set to 30, 50, and 100 μg/L as C by changing the flow rate of the chemical stock solution. An inline mixer was used to maintain the homogeneity of the chemicals and DIW. The effluent of the UV reactor was introduced to an IX column that was filled with a mixed bed of IX resin (Amberjet UP6040, DOW Chemical, cation to anion ratio of 2–3). The space velocity of the IX column was 40/h. A chemical stock solution was prepared by adding the appropriate volume of a target chemical in 2 L DIW. A chemical stock solution prepared from a single chemical before an experiment was started."
4,Sampling and analysis,"2.3 Sampling and analysis The concentration of chemical in the influent and effluent of the UV irradiation reactor and the effluent of the IX resin column was measured on a TOC analyzer and gas chromatograph. TOC measurements were made continuously by an online TOC meter (Sievers M9 On-line, Suez). The inorganic carbon removal (ICR) mode of the TOC meter was turned off to determine the CO2 concentration in the aqueous sample. The amount of CO2 that was produced during the oxidation of organic material by UV irradiation was calculated by subtracting the inorganic carbon (IC) in the effluent from that in the influent. Methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, IPA, acetone, and MEK concentrations in aqueous solution were measured on a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry instrument (GC/MS, Agilent GC 7890A-5975 L, USA) that was equipped with a DB624 column (0.32-mm inner diameter, 1.8-μm thickness, 60-m length). High-purity helium gas (99.999 %) was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 10 mL/min. The spilt ratio was 5:1. The GC inlet temperature was 150 °C, whereas the oven temperature was initially held at 40 °C for 2 min and then raised to 220 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. A pure & trap (Atomax, Teledyne Tekmar, USA) was installed in front of the GC–MS to extract VOC compounds from a liquid sample. These procedures of VOC determination were analogous to the studies proposed by Boczkaj’ researches [36,37]. The sample volume was 15 mL, and helium gas (99.999 %) was used as a carrier gas. The purge time and flow rate were 7 min and 40 mL/min, respectively. A mixture of six chemicals (methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, IPA, acetone, and MEK) was prepared as the stock solution for the calibration to allow the simultaneous measurement of six chemicals in solution. The photodegradation of LMW organic compounds in aqueous solution by 185-nm UV irradiation was studied using a continuously operated column reactor. Two analytical methods were applied to determine the removal efficiency of a target organic compound and the degradation byproducts. GC–MS was used to quantitatively analyze the concentration of a target materials and intermediate byproducts. The other method utilized a TOC analyzer. As shown in our previous report [33], TOC analysis of the effluent stream of a UV irradiation reactor with a following IX column provides useful information on the concentration of the final degradation product (CO2), charged organic compounds (COCs), and noncharged organic compounds (NCOCs), calculated using the following equations: (2) C O 2 conc . = TOC conc . in feed water – TOC conc . after UV reactor or = IC conc . after UV – IC conc . in feed water (3) COC = TOC conc. an UV reactor – TOC conc. after IX column (4) NCOC = TOC conc. after IX column COCs are degradation byproducts of LMW organic compounds by 185-nm UV and have a negative charge at neutral pH due to a carboxyl group in their structure. Based on their charge, COCs are removed easily by IX resin, especially anion exchange resin. In this study, such compounds as formic acid, acetic acid, and oxalic acid were assumed to be included in the COCs. The formation of carboxyl acid was also reported as byproducts of organic degradation during treatment by AOPs [39,40]. In the author’s previous study of methanol and IPA degradation by 185-nm UV, it was reported that the acetic acid and formic acid that were produced by UV irradiation were not detected in the sample from the effluent of IX resin [37]. This result supports the hypothesis that organic compounds with carboxyl functional groups are completely removed by IX resin. NCOCs in this study refer to the chemicals that have no charge at neutral pH and are not removed by IX resin. Organic compounds containing hydroxyl, aldehyde, or ketone functional groups are considered as NCOCs."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Degradation of methanol by UV irradiation,"3.1 Degradation of methanol by UV irradiation Fig. 2 shows the degradation of methanol by UV irradiation. Methanol is known to be sequentially oxidized to formaldehyde and formic acid and finally to CO2 [24]. The degradation experiments were performed at initial concentrations of 35, 50, and 100 μg/L as C. The results of the GC–MS and TOC analyses are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. Approximately 60 %–68 % of methanol was removed by 185-nm UV irradiation in the GC–MS analysis (see Fig. 2a), whereas in the TOC analysis, 10 %–60 % of the methanol was transformed to the final oxidation product, CO2 (see Fig. 2b), indicating that much of the methanol that was removed remained as intermediate byproducts, such as formaldehyde and formic acid, after UV irradiation. Although these chemicals were not analyzed specifically in this study, the amount of formic acid can be assumed to be equivalent to the concentration of COC in Fig. 2b, based on the hypothesis above. However, it was not possible to estimate the formaldehyde concentration using only the NCOC values that were calculated from the TOC measurements, because the NCOCs contained the remained methanol and the produced formaldehyde in the methanol degradation experiment. Thus, TOC and GC–MS analyses were performed to calculate the formaldehyde concentration in the effluent of the UV reactor: 0, 0, and 20 μg/L as C at initial methanol concentrations of 35, 50, and 100 μg/L as C. The ratio of CO2 to byproducts was 20.7–9.8 μg/L at the initial TOC concentration of 30 μg/L, whereas it decreased with higher initial concentrations, reaching 14.2–43.2 μg/L at 100 μg/L TOC—ie, the production of CO2 declined with increasing initial concentrations. Thus, the UV dosage and retention time in the photodegradation of methanol are insufficient to achieve the complete degradation of methanol. Three compounds (ethanol, acetaldehyde, and acetone) were detected in the GC–MS analysis as intermediate products of methanol degradation, despite their concentrations being less than 1.5 μg/L as C (Fig. 2a). This observation was unexpected, because methanol is transformed by UV irradiation to more oxidized chemicals, such as formaldehyde and formic acid, rather than chemicals that contain 2 or 3 carbons in their chemical structure [24]. Unfortunately, the formation mechanisms of these compounds were unable to be examined in this study. Further, it was unknown whether all 3 chemicals were produced directly during the decomposition of methanol or whether the methanol was initially transformed into ethanol or IPA and then oxidized to acetaldehyde and acetone. However, there were studies reporting that ethylene glycol has been generated by recombining hydroxymethyl radicals in the photodegradation of methanol by 172-nm UV in an oxygen-free solution [32,38]. Specifically, Heit et al. [38] stated that the recombination of c-centered radicals is favorable when organic materials are photodegraded by VUV in the absence of dissolved oxygen. Although the chemicals that were formed in their studies were not the same as those in this study, the mechanism that has been proposed by Heit et al. [24] and Robl et al. [32] indirectly supports the formation of ethanol, acetaldehyde, and acetone that we observed."
7,Degradation of ethanol and acetaldehyde by UV irradiation,"3.2 Degradation of ethanol and acetaldehyde by UV irradiation Figs. 3 and 4 show the results of the photodegradation of ethanol and acetaldehyde by 185-nm UV. Fig. 3 shows the results of the GC–MS (a) and TOC analysis (b). Ethanol that was exposed to 185-nm UV is generally oxidized to acetaldehyde, followed by acetic acid and CO2 [39,40], indicating that acetaldehyde is more oxidized form compared with ethanol. Thus, the concentration of intermediate byproducts or the final product, CO2, during acetaldehyde degradation (Fig. 4) might be high versus in the ethanol degradation experiment (Fig. 3) with the same UV exposure. This hypothesis was supported by the results that the percentage of CO2 that was produced in ethanol degradation was 1 %–18 %—lower than the 8 %–25 % during acetaldehyde degradation. In addition, COC production was 13 %–15 % higher in aldehyde degradation compared to ethanol degradation. Comparing ethanol and acetaldehyde degradation at an initial concentration of 50 μg/L as C, the concentration of the ethanol and acetaldehyde that remained after 185-nm UV treatment was 9.8 μg/L as C and 0.6 μg/L as C, respectively (Figs. 3a and 4 a), indicating that the photodegradation rate of acetaldehyde by 185-nm UV was faster than that of ethanol, similar to what was reported by Bianchi et al. [39]. Additionally, in the comparison of between ethanol and methanol degradation by GC–MS analysis (Figs. 2a and 3 a), the removal rate of ethanol was much faster than methanol. 35 μg/L as C of ethanol was completely removed from the feed solution through the continuously operated UV column reactor, whereas 30 % of the methanol remained in the effluent of the UV reactor. Kim et al. also reported that acetone had the highest degradation rate by 185-nm UV lightning in a batch test using without dissolve oxygen, followed by ethanol and methanol [31]. In the GC–MS analysis, acetaldehyde, acetone, and MEK were also observed as byproducts in the degradation of ethanol. The production of acetaldehyde was expected, because ethanol initially transformed into acetaldehyde, whereas acetone and MEK were unanticipated in the pathway of ethanol degradation presented by Bianchi et al. [39]. Also, in the degradation of acetaldehyde, acetone and MEK were also detected, ranging in concentration from 0 to 1.3 μg/L as C. The formation of these unexpected intermediate byproducts such as acetone and MEK implies that various unidentified reactions are involved in the degradation of LMW organic compounds by 185-nm UV irradiation."
8,Degradation of IPA and acetone by UV irradiation,"3.3 Degradation of IPA and acetone by UV irradiation The results of the IPA and acetone degradation experiments are presented in Figs. 5 and 6 . In the degradation of IPA (Fig. 5a), over 90 % of the IPA in the influent of the UV reactor was transformed to byproducts and CO2. In the GC analysis, acetone was observed as a byproduct, ranging in concentration from 10 to 61 μg/L as C, which was proportional to the 34 %–63 % of IPA that was injected. This result indicates that the oxidation rate of IPA to acetone was much faster than that of acetone to pyruvic aldehyde, pyruvic acid, or oxalic acid, which are reported byproducts of acetone degradation [6]. The relatively fast degradation of IPA compared to that of acetone can also be confirmed by directly comparing acetone degradation as well as IPA degradation (Figs. 5 and 6). At an initial concentration of 100 μg/L as C, the removed IPA concentration and acetone concentration after UV irradiation was 90 and 47 μg/L as C, respectively, which means the degradation rate of IPA was twice faster than that of acetone. Wu et al. [7] reported similar results on the rapid decline in IPA and the accumulation of acetone at the early stage in the degradation of IPA using an ozone-based AOP. During the oxidation of acetone, the concentration of NCOCs, based on the TOC analysis, ranged from 12 to 56 μg/L as C (Fig. 6a), which was almost same as the concentration of acetone in the GC–MS analysis (Fig. 6b). It means that uncharged byproducts of acetone oxidation, such as pyruvic aldehyde, did not exist after the UV treatment since NCOCs is the sum of the remained acetone and the produced uncharged byproduct. In other word, it can be presumed that the degradation rate of acetone was relatively slower than that of pyruvic aldehyde. In the acetone degradation, acetone reacted with hydroxyl radical was initially transformed to acetonyl radical by hydrogen abstraction and pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, acetic acid, and formic acid was also observed as byproducts of acetone oxidation [6]. They have a carboxyl functional group in their chemical structure, resulting in a negative charge at neutral pH. Although these charged chemicals were not measured individually, they were quantified in this study as COCs, which was calculated to be 11, 18, and 34 μg/L at initial acetone concentrations of 30, 50, and 100 μg/L, respectively (Fig. 6b). During acetone degradation, more CO2 was produced than during IPA degradation because the degradation steps from acetone to CO2 was shorter than that from IPA to CO2."
9,Degradation of MEK by UV irradiation,"3.4 Degradation of MEK by UV irradiation MEK degradation by 185-nm UV was examined; the results are presented in Fig. 7 . In the GC–MS analysis (Fig. 7a), 75 %–95 % of the MEK was degraded, and acetone was detected as a byproduct, despite the concentration of acetone being less than 3 μg/L as C. The NOC centration was 5.5–43 μg/L, higher than the sum of the remained MEK and the produced acetone, indicating that other intermediate byproducts, except acetone, were present in the effluent of the UV reactor. The COC concentration increased with increasing initial concentrations of MEK."
10,Comparison of degradation characteristics,"3.5 Comparison of degradation characteristics The degradation efficiency and distribution of byproducts between chemicals were compared at an initial concentration of 100 μg/L. The chemical showing the highest rate of conversion to the final product of oxidation, CO2, was methanol followed by acetaldehyde and acetone. It was expected because methanol contains one carbon atom and requires the fewest hydroxyl radials to convert to CO2. Further, the amount of CO2 that was generated from acetaldehyde and acetone was higher than with ethanol and IPA, because acetaldehyde and acetone are more oxidized forms compared with ethanol and IPA. However, the fastest conversion was observed in the IPA degradation by 185-nm UV irradiation, wherein 97 % of the IPA was oxidized to acetone, whereas acetone had the slowest oxidation rate of the six chemicals. In the comparison of alcohol compounds (methanol, ethanol, and IPA), the efficiency of the conversion to CO2 increased with decreasing the number of carbons, whereas the degradation rate of alcohol to byproducts that contained an aldehyde or ketone group increased in the following order: IPA, ethanol, and methanol. Overall, in the comparison of intermediate byproducts, the amount of COCs was higher than that of NCOC byproducts, due to the slow conversion of chemicals that contained carboxyl groups to CO2 on exposure to 185-nm UV. The highest proportion of COCs was detected in the degradation of acetaldehyde, followed by MEK and ethanol. As seen in Table 1 , the amount of COCs exceeded that of CO2, supporting the installation of IX resin after TOC reduction UV process in UPW production system. In general, the concentration of TOCs is significantly lower after TOC reduction UV with IX resin than after TOC reduction UV alone."
11,Conclusions,"The photodegradation of LMW organic compounds by 185-nm UV irradiation was examined using continuous-flow column reactor. Six organic compounds (methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, IPA, acetone, and MEK) were selected as target compounds, because they are frequently detected in the permeate of RO in UPW production and have a molecular weight of 100 or less. Methanol had the highest conversion efficiency to the final oxidation product, CO2, compared with the other compounds, because its degradation step by UV irradiation was short and simple. The compounds with the fastest and slowest degradation rates were IPA and acetone, respectively, based on the GC–MS analysis. In a system composed of TOC-UV and IX resin, the removal efficiency of TOC was higher for chemicals with an aldehyde or ketone group than in those with alcohol. Also, continuous-flow experiments were conducted in different initial concentrations to provide useful engineering data for estimating removal efficiencies of LMW organic compounds in the design of TOC reduction UV unit."
