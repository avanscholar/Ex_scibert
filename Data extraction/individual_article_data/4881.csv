0,Introduction,"The current world consumption of hydrogen has a sustained annual growth forecast of 5–10% (with 50% of the total energy consumption predicted for 2100) [1,2]. In a sustainable framework, the following hydrogen market prospects can be distinguished [3]: i) large-scale industrial use, mainly for production of ammonia and methanol which is carried out currently by reforming of different petroleum fractions; ii) use in commercial sectors, such as metal processing, glass manufacture, semiconductors production (microelectronics), food industry, among others; iii) for providing heat in processes where hydrogen is generated as byproduct, such as the electrochemical obtaining of Cl and NaOH or the ethylene production by thermal cracking; iv) as clean energy source or carrier with high efficiency since it possesses the highest calorific power (122 kJ/g) compared to any other known fuels. Besides, it burns cleanly, without generating any environmental pollutants and the only byproduct is water. Currently production of hydrogen is mainly obtained from fossil fuels [4] (48% from natural gas, 30% from oil-derived naphtas and 18% from coal), which results in CO2 emissions during its production processes (mainly by steam reforming). The future hydrogen market, as fuel and energy carrier, is promoted by the need to reduce CO2 emissions, which requires its production from renewable raw materials and energy sources. Nowotny and Veziroglu [5] predict the transition period between the petroleum based economy and that based on the hydrogen produced from renewable sources by before the year 2016. The technological development of the different routes for hydrogen production from biomass has attracted considerable attention due to its renewable and environmentally-friendly nature [6]. Hydrogen can be generated from biomass by direct thermochemical processes (Fig. 1 ), such as high temperature and catalytic pyrolysis [7], gasification [8,9], biological processes and routes with intermediate steps of production of oxygenates and their subsequent reforming [10]. The steam reforming of pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) is one of the most promising routes, based on the possibility of geographic relocation of the biomass pyrolysis plants (with simple technology, low-cost and environmentally friendly) [11] and subsequent bio-oil transportation and reforming, centralized at large-scale. However, the crude bio-oil tends to re-polymerize due to certain bio-oil components derived from the pyrolysis of the biomass lignin, which results in formation of a carbonaceous deposit (pyrolytic lignin). This deposition creates problems that affect the reactor feed system and operation, and the catalyst deactivation due to the formation of external and internal coke (within the porous structure). Valle et al. [12]. studied the nature of the coke and its location within the pores of HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts in the transformation of crude bio-oil into hydrocarbons. Based on the afore-mentioned problems and with the purpose of progressing in crude bio-oil valorization, most of the studies on bio-oil reactivity and comparison of reforming catalysts have been conducted with model compounds, constituents of the complex and unstable bio-oil structure, and with bio-oil aqueous fractions. By adding water bio-oil separates into a hydrophobic lignin-derived fraction and an aqueous (hydrophilic) fraction that contains the light carbohydrate-derived compounds. Less pyrolytic lignin is deposited during the vaporization of this aqueous fraction, compared with the crude bio-oil vaporization [13]. The acetic acid reforming reaction with Ni based catalysts (promoted with La or Co) has been extensively studied in literature [14–18] as a bio-oil model compound. This type of catalysts has also been studied in reforming reactions of acetone, phenol, acetol (hydroxyacetone) [19,20], toluene [21–23], m-cresol, dibenzyl ether, glucose, xylose and sucrose [24]. The beneficial effect of La2O3 addition on the behavior of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts has been proved in the literature for the reforming of acetic acid [15,16,25], acetol [20], toluene [21], n-dodecane [26], ethanol [27], glycerol [28] and mixtures glycerol/ethanol [29]. Iwasa et al. [30] compared different Ni based catalysts, modified with alkali metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs), in the acetic acid reforming reaction and the untreated catalyst showed the best performance. Noble metals (Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru) based catalysts, supported on α-Al2O3, CeO2 and ZrO2, have also been used for reforming reactions of acetic acid and other model compounds (acetone, phenol) [31–33]. The early studies on reforming of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil were performed in a fixed bed [34], using bio-oil fractions with high water content, which attenuates catalyst deactivation [35]. The bed blocking problems observed have been mitigated by the use of fluidized bed reactors [36–38]. Kechagiopoulos et al. [39] and Basagianis and Verykios [40] emphasized the operational difficulties due to the thermal coke deposition in the reactor walls, which led to the use of spouted bed reactors [41]. The catalysts used in those papers were based on Ni, such as commercial catalysts for naphtha reforming [34,42], Ni/Al2O3 modified by Ca or Mg [37], Ni/dolomite [36] and Ni/MgO [38]. Noble metals based catalysts have also been used, such as Ru–Mg–Al2O3 supported in monoliths, porous ceramic materials and γ-Al2O3 [40]. Standard hydrogen yield was 65%, at temperature around 800 °C with S/C (steam-to-carbon ratio) greater than 10 and space velocity around WHSV = 1.0 h−1. The gasification of coke is promoted by increasing temperature and S/C and thereby the catalyst deactivation is attenuated. Yan et al. [43] studied the incorporation of CO2 sorbents along with a commercial catalyst (not described) and they attained higher hydrogen yield with calcined dolomite (up to 83%) and CaO (up to 85%) than without sorbent (75%). In this paper, we study a continuous process with two stages in-line, thermal and catalytic, aimed at minimizing the problems inherent to lignin deposition. The first step allows a controlled pyrolytic lignin deposition and the treated bio-oil (outlet volatile stream) is reformed in the catalytic fluidized bed located in-line. Ni supported on α-Al2O3 catalyst (Ni/α-Al2O3) and other promoted with La2O3 (Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3) have been tested in the two-step system. This work is aimed at proving the interest of this technology, with continuous feeding of the bio-oil aqueous fraction, and these catalysts. Furthermore, the range of operating conditions more suitable for obtaining a stable and high hydrogen yield is determined."
1,Experimental,
2,Bio-oil production and composition,"2.1 Bio-oil production and composition Bio-oil was obtained by flash pyrolysis of pine sawdust in a semi-industrial demonstration plant, located in Ikerlan-IK4 technology center (Alava, Spain), with a biomass feeding capacity of 25 kg/h [44]. This plant was developed based on the academic results obtained in a laboratory plant (120 g/h) in the University of the Basque Country [45,46]. The aqueous fraction was obtained by phase separation after adding water to crude bio-oil, in water/bio-oil mass ratio = 2/1, by following the procedure described by Czernik et al. [42]. The composition of this aqueous fraction, in water-free basis, was determined by GC/MS analyser (Shimadzu QP2010S device) and it is shown in Table 1 . The compounds identification was accomplished with the NIST 140 library, and their quantification was carried out by determining calibration factors of the GC/MS device with pattern mixtures of bio-oil components. The corresponding molecular formula is C4.1H7.4O2.7. The correct and complete characterization of bio-oil is a difficult task that requires the use of various analytical techniques. The CHO formula obtained by GC/MS was confirmed by elemental analysis (Leco CHN-932 analyzer and ultra-microbalance Sartorious M2P), with similar results, although less reproducible. The molecular weight distribution of crude and aqueous bio-oil components was analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a Waters model 616. The results for the bio-oil aqueous fraction (Fig. 2 ) show 30 wt% of heavy compounds (with molecular weights higher than 320 g/mol), unable to be seen using GC–MS [47]. This heavy fraction is taken into account to determine the empirical molecular formula, by assigning it a representative CHO formula (average of the compounds detected by GC–MS with molecular weights above 300 g/mol). Water content of the crude bio-oil and its aqueous fraction, determined by Karl Fischer titration on a 870 KF Titrino Plus device, was 35% and 82%, respectively."
3,Catalysts,"2.2 Catalysts Both Ni/α-Al2O3 and Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalysts were prepared with the method described by Alberton et al. [48]. The La2O3-αAl2O3 support was obtained by impregnation of α-Al2O3, under vacuum at 70 °C, with an aqueous solution of La(NO3)3·6H2O (Alfa Aesar, 99%), followed by drying at 100 °C for 24 h and calcination at 900 °C for 3 h. After the subsequent impregnation with Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and drying at 110 °C for 24 h, the final calcination of the catalysts was carried out at 700 °C for 3 h. In this paper, both catalysts were prepared with 10 wt% of Ni and the La2O3 loading was 10 wt%. These contents were determined to be optimal in a previous work [49], which studied the effect of these contents on the catalyst activity and stability for ethanol steam reforming. The physical properties of the catalysts (BET surface area, pore volume and average pore size) were evaluated from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, obtained by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010C analyzer. This device is also used for hydrogen chemisorption measurements for quantifying metal dispersion and specific metallic surface (m2/gmetal). After initial evacuation step, the metal phase is reduced for 6 h with H2 flow, following a heating ramp up to 700 °C. Then impurities are removed from the catalyst surface (evacuation with He) and analyses were carried out at 35 °C, following the method used by Ibrahim et al. [50] for Ni catalysts. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out for determining the reduction temperature of the different metallic phases present in the catalyst. These tests were conducted on an AutoChem II 2920 Micromeritics. The metal content were measured by inductively coupled plasma and atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were measured on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractrometer with a CuKα1 radiation, in order to calculate the average Ni particle size by using the Scherrer formula. The device is equipped with a Germanium primary monochromator, Bragg-Brentano geometry and with a CuKα1 wavelength of 1.5406 Å, corresponding to an X-ray tube with Cu anticathode. Sol-X dispersive energy detector was employed, with a window optimized for CuKα1 for limiting the fluorescence radiation. Data collection was carried continuously, from 10° to 80° with step of 0.04° in 2θ and measurement time per step of 12 s. The TPO (temperature programmed oxidation) analysis of the coke deposited on the deactivated catalysts were conducted by combustion with air in a Setaram TG-DSC-11 Calorimeter coupled to a mass spectrometer Thermostar Balzers Instrument for monitoring the signals corresponding to the masses 18 (H2O), and 44 (CO2)."
4,Reaction and analysis equipment,"2.3 Reaction and analysis equipment The reaction equipment has been previously described in detail for the transformation of bio-oil and bio-oil + methanol into hydrocarbons [51] and consists of two reactors in-line (Fig. 3 ). The first reactor (thermal processing of bio-oil) retains the carbonaceous solid (pyrolytic lignin) formed by re-polymerization of certain bio-oil oxygenated components. The volatile compounds that leave this thermal step are subsequently transformed (by catalytic steam reforming) in the second unit (fluidized bed reactor). The controlled deposition of pyrolytic lignin in a specific thermal step, prior to the catalytic reactor, minimizes the operating problems caused by this deposition and attenuates catalyst deactivation, as has been previously verified for the catalytic conversion of crude bio-oil into hydrocarbons [52,53]. The on-line analysis of the reforming products is carried out continuously (more representative and stable than discontinuous sampling) with a gas chromatograph (Agilent Micro GC 3000) provided with four modules for the analysis of the following: (1) permanent gases (O2, H2, CO, and CH4) with 5A molecular sieve capillary column; (2) light oxygenates (C2−), CO2 and water, with Plot Q capillary column; (3) C2–C4 hydrocarbons, with alumina capillary column; (4) oxygenated compounds (C2+) with Stabilwax type column."
5,Experimental conditions,"2.4 Experimental conditions The experimental two-unit system was operated at atmospheric pressure and the bio-oil aqueous fraction feeding rate (0.1 ml/min) was controlled by an injection pump Harvard Apparatus 22. The particle size of the catalysts was 150–250 μm and they were mixed with a solid inert (carborundum, 37 μm) in catalyst/inert mass ratio of 4/1 for improving the fluid-dynamic properties of the catalytic bed. Prior to the reforming reactions, the catalysts were reduced at 700 °C for 2 h by using a H2–He flow (5 vol% of H2). The reforming conditions were: thermal step, 200 °C; catalytic steam reforming, 600–800 °C; steam-to-carbon ratio (steam/carbon ratio in bio-oil) at fluidized bed reactor inlet (S/C) = 12; space-time (τ) = 0.10–0.45 gcatalyst h (gbio-oil)−1; GC1HSV = 8100–40,300 h−1 (calculated with CH4 equivalent units)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts Table 2 shows the catalytic properties, such as Ni content, BET surface area, pore volume, Ni averaged crystallite size, metallic specific surface and dispersion. BET surface of the α-Al2O3 support (72 m2/g) decreases slightly with the impregnation of 10 wt% of Ni (65.5 m2/g) and most notably with the impregnation of 10 wt% of La2O3 (42.5 m2/g), due to the higher volume of the La2O3 molecule compared with the Ni metal. The addition of La2O3 to the Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst does not produce a significant effect on the metallic surface and dispersion, but it involves an increase in Ni crystal size. Fig. 4 shows the TPR-profiles of the catalysts. The NiO reduction is observed in the range 340–600 °C [54]. The results show that the addition of La2O3 increases the proportion of NiAl2O4 spinel (peak at 650–676 °C) [55] due to the strong interaction between Ni and La ions, which is consistent with the findings of Sanchez-Sanchez et al. [56]. The XRD analysis (Fig. 5 ) was carried out to investigate the diffraction structure of the catalysts after reduction at 700 °C for 2 h. The characterization result by XRD of the unreduced Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst is also shown in Fig. 5. The XRD spectra of both reduced catalysts are similar, with the presence of Al2O3 phase and Ni0 phase, which is clearly revealed by the characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 44.5°, 51.9° and 76.4°. It is also confirmed that La2O3 phase neither reduces nor exists in oxide form, but it combines with α-Al2O3 to form the LaAlO3 phase."
8,Reaction indexes,"3.2 Reaction indexes Bio-oil steam reforming proceeds according to the reforming reactions of oxygenated organic compounds (C n H m O k ) and water-gas-shift reaction (WGS). The stoichiometry of the global reaction is: (1) C n H m O k + ( 2 n − k ) H 2 O → n CO 2 + ( 2 n + m 2 − k ) H 2 The bio-oil conversion is calculated from oxygenates molar flow rates at the inlet and outlet (unreacted bio-oil) of the catalytic reactor, according to: (2) X = F bio - oil , inlet − F bio - oil , outlet F bio - oil , inlet The bio-oil molar flow rate at catalytic reactor inlet (F bio-oil,inlet) is calculated from the mass flow rate of the bio-oil fed to the system and its C n H m O k empirical formula (calculated by GCMS analysis). After the thermal treatment step, the molecular formula of the bio-oil that enters the reactor is recalculated by subtracting the pyrolytic lignin deposited in this unit. For this purpose, the deposition rate of pyrolytic lignin and its elemental composition (C, H, and O) are considered. The molar flow rate of bio-oil at reactor outlet (F bio-oil,outlet) is calculated from the molar fraction of oxygenates (analyzed by microGC and by GC/MS) and the total number of moles at the reactor outlet, determined by mass balance for the catalytic reactor. The hydrogen yield is calculated as a percentage of the stoichiometric potential, in case of complete conversion of the carbon contained in bio-oil to CO2 (according to the Eq. (1)): (3) Y H 2 = molar flow of H 2 obtained ( 2 n + m / 2 − k ) × molar flow of C in the feed/ n × 100 The yield of each carbon-containing byproduct (CO, CO2, CH4 and light hydrocarbons C2–C4) is quantified by: (4) Y i = moles of i ( CO , CO 2 , CH 4 , HCs ) obtained moles of C in the feed × 100 The selectivity of each i product is calculated: (5) S i = molar flow of i obtained molar flow of C in the feed × 100"
9,Effect of La2O3 addition to Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst,"3.3 Effect of La2O3 addition to Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst Two parameters that have an important effect on hydrogen yield (reaction temperature and space-time) were investigated with Ni/α-Al2O3 and Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalysts. The thermal treatment (first step at 200 °C) of the aqueous bio-oil (C4.1H7.4O2.7) retained 30 wt% of pyrolytic lignin (referred to bio-oil oxygenates). Consequently, the composition of the treated bio-oil that enters the fluidized bed reactor is C3.7H8.4O2.9 and thus the maximum yield (stoichiometric) of hydrogen is 2.35 mol H2/mol C fed. Fig. 6 shows the effect of reaction temperature on bio-oil conversion (Fig. 6a) and hydrogen yield (Fig. 6b) with time on stream. Table 3 shows the results of hydrogen selectivity and the yields of CO, CO2, CH4 and hydrocarbons, corresponding to the fresh catalyst (t = 0 h) and after 5 h of reaction. The space-time used in these experiments (0.22 gcatalyst h (gbio-oil)−1) is enough for attaining complete conversion at zero time on stream (fresh catalyst) for both catalysts and, consequently, no remarkable effect of temperature on bio-oil initial conversion is observed. However, the reaction temperature has a significant effect on the evolution with time on stream of bio-oil conversion due to its effect on the catalysts deactivation (studied in following sections). As can be seen in Fig. 6a, the catalyst deactivation is less pronounced at 700 °C than at 600 °C. When this exceeds 700 °C, bio-oil conversion is almost constant for 5 h of reaction. Furthermore, the addition of La2O3 to the catalyst does not have a notable effect on bio-oil conversion at 600 °C (when the deactivation is pronounced for both catalysts). As shown in Fig. 6b, the hydrogen yield at zero time on stream is almost independent of temperature for both catalysts. However, the temperature has a noticeable effect on deactivation and a rapid decrease in hydrogen yield with time on stream is observed at 600 °C. This effect is attenuated when reaction temperature is above 700 °C. The deactivation observed at 800 °C is higher than at 700 °C, especially with the Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst because of the nickel sintering (discussed below). It is noteworthy that hydrogen production is higher with the Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst for the three temperatures studied. This favorable effect of La2O3 incorporation may be attributed to its water adsorption capacity [57] thereby favoring the WGS reaction, for which the Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst has moderate activity [58,59]. In Table 3 the results of hydrogen selectivity and the yields of byproducts (CO2, CO, CH4 and C2+ hydrocarbons) at zero time on stream and at 5 h of time on stream are set out. Initial hydrogen selectivity is maximum at 700 °C for the Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst (69.6%) and at 600 °C for the Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst (71.2%). After 5 h of time on stream the greatest selectivity to H2 was obtained at 600 °C for both catalysts due to deactivation. The increase in CO yield with time on stream is consequence of the catalysts deactivation, which affects the catalytic steam reforming and WGS reactions. Moreover, thermal decomposition reactions of bio-oil oxygenated compounds are enhanced by the catalyst deactivation, with the consequent formation of CO, CH4 and hydrocarbons. The yields achieved after 5 h of time on stream for these byproducts with Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst are clearly higher when reaction temperature is higher. However, for the catalyst with La2O3 the increase of CO, CH4 and hydrocarbons yields with time on stream are slight and similar at 600 and 700 °C. Although this increase is more noticeable at 800 °C, the yields obtained for these byproducts are lower than those obtained with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Therefore, these results of Fig. 6 and Table 3 emphasize that the addition of La2O3 to the catalyst significantly reduces deactivation and thus attenuates the formation of these byproducts. Fig. 7 shows the effect of space-time on the evolution with time on stream of bio-oil conversion (Fig. 7a) and hydrogen yield (Fig. 7b) for both catalysts at 700 °C. Table 4 shows the values of hydrogen selectivity and byproducts yields corresponding to the fresh catalyst (t = 0 h) and after 5 h of time on stream. In the space-time range studied (0.10–0.45 gcatalyst h (gbio-oil)−1) the Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst shows a better performance (higher bio-oil conversion and hydrogen yield and lower deactivation) than the Ni/α-Al2O3. A space-time around 0.45 gcatalyst h (gbio-oil)−1 is necessary for attaining complete conversion over the Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst (which remains almost constant for 5 h (Fig. 7a)) and hydrogen yield near to the stoichiometric value (which decreases slightly with time on stream (Fig. 7b)). These targets are achieved for a space-time of 0.22 gcatalyst h (gbio-oil)−1 with the Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst. For both catalysts, the increase in space-time contributes to attenuating deactivation. As shown in Table 4, an increase in space-time causes a slight increase in the initial values of hydrogen selectivity and CO2 yield and a decrease in the yields of CO, CH4 and hydrocarbons. After 5 h of reaction (when catalyst is partially deactivated and thus conversion is far from being complete) the space-time effect is more significant. The increase in CO yield with time on stream due to WGS reaction deactivation and thermal decomposition reactions of bio-oil oxygenates is greatly attenuated by the addition of La2O3, and thereby half the space-time is enough for obtaining the same hydrogen yield. The CH4 yield, which has great influence on hydrogen yield (as it has 4 H atoms per molecule), follows the same trend with reaction time and space-time as the CO yield. The addition of La2O3 also helps to reduce the formation of CH4 and light hydrocarbons. The effect of the addition of La2O3 on inhibition of the WGS reaction deactivation and thermal decomposition reactions of bio-oil will be further discussed in Section 3.4."
10,Stability and deactivation of Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst,"3.4 Stability and deactivation of Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst The catalysts stability was tested in long-term reactions (20 h) and the results of bio-oil conversion and hydrogen yield and selectivity are shown in Fig. 8 . The operating conditions were: 700 °C, GC1HSV = 8100 h−1, S/C = 12, τ = 0.45 gcatalyst h (gbio-oil)−1. Bio-oil conversion (Fig. 8a) decreases from 100% to 96% for 20 h of time on stream with the Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst, while the hydrogen yield (Fig. 8b) gradually dropped from 94% to 65% that indicates notable deactivation of the catalyst. The Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst is more stable, with almost constant conversion around 100%. The hydrogen yield decreases from 95% to 85% and the selectivity from 70% to 66%. The above results confirm that La2O3 provides stability to the Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst, thereby attenuating significantly its deactivation. Possible causes are: i) La2O3 capacity for water adsorption [57,59], which favors the WGS reaction and inhibits the adsorption of coke precursors and their growth mechanism (oligomerization–aromatization–condensation reactions); ii) the increase in the amount of surface oxygen in metal sites due to the creation of oxygen vacancy defects that promoting the migration of O2− ions on the Ni metallic surface by the lower valence of La3+ [60]. Furthermore, certain authors [59,61–63] reported the La2O3 capacity for generating surface oxygen by the formation of La2O2CO3 carbonate, which is active for reacting with the coke and thus cleaning the Ni metallic surface; iii) the basic character of La2O3 may neutralize the low acidity of α-Al2O3, and therefore attenuate hydrocarbon formation (by dehydration) and their evolution to coke precursors. Certain authors emphasize the role of La2O3 and attribute coke formation to the degradation of the hydrocarbons formed by secondary reactions in the steam reforming [64]. In addition, La2O3 provides thermal stability to the catalyst, attenuating the formation of Ni atom clusters [65]. Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) curves of the coke deposited on both catalysts after 5 h of time on stream, at 700 °C and space-time 0.45 gcatalyst h (gbio-oil)−1, are shown in Fig. 9 . These results correspond to the incipient coke deposition, with very low contents of 0.25 wt% for the Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst and 0.11 wt% for the Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst. Three peaks can be distinguished: the first one around 275 °C for both catalysts; the second one at 420 °C, only detected over the Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst, and the third peak, detected at 660 °C for the Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst and shifted slightly to lower temperature for the Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst. The three peaks observed in the TPO curves may be attributed to: i) coke deposited on Ni metal particles (the peak at lower temperature), which is easily accessible to gasification during the steam reforming and to oxygen during its combustion, activated by these Ni particles; ii) coke presumably deposited on the Ni–La2O3 and/or Ni–Al2O3 interface, whose gasification is enhanced by La2O3 and thus it is negligible for the Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst above 700 °C and high values of space-time; iii) coke deposited on the α-Al2O3 support, whose combustion is not catalytically actived and may even be hindered by the oxygen diffusional limitation within the porous structure of this α-Al2O3. These hypothesis are supported by studies in literature that highlight the interest of studying the TPO profiles to analyze the coke nature and its location for different catalytic processes [12,66–69]. The magnitude and position of these peaks depend on both the catalyst and operating conditions and, therefore, the determination of the nature and location of the different types of coke require further studies, which are out of the scope of this paper. Table 5 shows the results of coke content deposited over both catalysts at 600, 700 and 800 °C, at space-time value of 0.22 gcatalyst h (gbio-oil)−1. The results listed in Table 6 correspond to different values of space-time (0.1, 0.22 and 0.45 gcatalyst h (gbio-oil)−1) at 700 °C. Coke contents decreases with the increase in temperature (Table 5) and space-time (Table 6) for both catalysts, which is consistent with the afore-mentioned effect of these variables on the reaction indexes evolution with time on stream. It is also noteworthy that La2O3 addition helps to reduce the coke content and the second peak is hardly observed in the TPO profile for both catalysts at low coke contents. Based on the above results, the amount of coke that deposits over Ni particles is greatly attenuated by the La2O3 addition, since this disfavors its formation and promotes gasification [56,60–62]. Furthermore, this gasification is favored by increasing temperature (Table 5) and space-time (Table 6). The temperature increase has the opposite effects of enhancing coke formation mechanisms [70] and promoting its gasification, which results in a very low amount of coke deposited at 700 °C. In addition to coke deposition, other possible cause of catalyst deactivation is the sintering of Ni metal particles, in whose mechanism the reaction temperature has a significant effect. Table 7 shows the results of the average Ni particle size, determined by XRD for both catalysts, fresh and deactivated (after 5 h of reaction) at 700 °C. The largest Ni particle diameter observed in the fresh catalyst promoted with La2O3 has also been observed previously [65,71] for lower La2O3 contents. The catalyst without La2O3 undergoes sintering at 700 °C, thereby doubling its initial Ni particle size and reducing the metal surface available for reactants adsorption, which results in low reforming activity. The addition of La2O3 avoids sintering, by separating the Ni crystals and thus favoring their reducibility and attenuating the formation of clusters [71]. This temperature limit of 700 °C for avoiding the sintering of Ni supported on Al2O3 has also been observed by Ibrahim and Idem [72] in the reforming of gasoline with partial oxidation. It is worth pointing out that catalyst deactivation by sintering reduces the reforming and WGS reactions rates and it also has the secondary effect of promoting the undesirable reactions of bio-oil thermal decomposition, which lead to formation of byproducts (CO, CH4 and hydrocarbons). The hydrocarbons formed may condense to form more coke over the Ni metal particles. This secondary effect helps to justify the afore-mentioned rapid deterioration of reaction indexes at 800 °C."
11,Conclusions,"The proposed reaction equipment is suitable for continuous reforming of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil, without operational problems and with low catalyst deactivation, when working under suitable conditions. The process consists of two stages in series; the first one at 200 °C for the pyrolytic lignin retention, and the second one (fluidized bed reactor) for in-line catalytic reforming of the treated bio-oil. The results obtained at different values of reforming temperature and space-time show that La2O3 addition to the Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst improves the hydrogen yield and selectivity. The deactivation is also significantly attenuated by the enhanced water adsorption capacity, which is a key stage for steam reforming of oxygenates adsorbed in Ni particles. The gasification of coke precursors are enhanced by the increase in reaction temperature above 700 °C and, in a lesser extent, by the increase in space-time. At this temperature, gasification is more favored than the formation of coke precursors by the degradation of bio-oil oxygenates. The Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst dos not undergo deactivation by sintering at 700 °C due to the La2O3 addition and complete conversion of bio-oil is achieved, at space-time of 0.22 gcatalyst h (gbio-oil)−1, with hydrogen yield of 96% and 70% of hydrogen selectivity. It is concluded that continuous reforming of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil is feasible in the two-step reaction system used and over these catalysts. These results are hopeful to face in future research works, the study of crude bio-oil reforming with this technology and the Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst."
