0,Introduction,"The global energy demand is growing rapidly, and the majority of the current demand is met by fossil-based fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Since the industrial revolution, our increased dependence on fossil fuels has resulted in various airborne emissions leading to climatic changes and environmental and health effects. The increase in CO2 emissions over the past few decades results from the evidence of global warming. An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report suggests that the CO2 emission rate has nearly doubled in the past decade. As a result, its concentration in the atmosphere has crossed the 400 ppm level [1–3]. It is suggested that the earth's average surface temperature should not increase more than 2 °C and CO2 concentration remains under 450 ppm [9–11]. The developing countries are striving hard to mitigate global warming and searching for alternative forms of renewable energy that are carbon neutral and sustainable. Renewable sources' consumption has increased steadily over the years and reached more than 10% of the United Kingdom's total energy consumption in 2017. And also, the European Commission has set legally binding targets to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050 [4]. In this regard, biomass has gained wide attention over the past few years due to its easy accessibility, abundant supply [5]. The biomass conversion technologies could also enhance the rural economy and employment generation while reducing the country's dependence on imported fossil fuels. One such source is rice husk (RH) from rice milling and can produce value-added products by thermal, biological, physical, and catalytic techniques. RH differs from other biomass varieties by its inherently high silica and ash content. Even though most North Indian farmers rear cattle, RH is not considered fit for cattle feeding due to its high silica and low nutrient content [7]. The RH has a low density and needs a large area for disposing of the waste. Moreover, the logistics cost involved in transporting the material, difficulties involved in collecting the material from field etc. hamper its effective use in other applications. Even though governmental regulations are in place to limit paddy stubble burning, farmers in rural India continue the practice owing to financial constraints and lack of other sustainable and profitable options and incentives [8]. The silica portion in RH creates significant environmental damage to the water bodies due to the low biodegradability of silica. Presently, RH is utilized in fiber board making, paper production, fuel for boilers for steam generation, and soil fertilization. [6]. Neverthless, RH has a use potential to produce sustainable products from thermochemical processes. The conversion of RH into bioenergy and value-added products has been attracted globally due to the key benefits such as environmentally benign operations and utilization of biomass resources. Among biomass conversion techniques, fast pyrolysis attracted much more attention due to the production of high yields of bio-oil. The bio-oil can be upgraded in the presence of catalysts to meet the properties of diesel fuel. A large number of articles have been reviewed on the conversion of biomass into value-added products. However, primarily devoted to a variety of biomass sources. For instance, Oregui-Bengoechea et al. reviewed the catalytic thermochemical conversion of lignin model compounds based on reductive, oxidative, pyrolytic, and hydrolytic processes. The noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru) and Ni catalysts are explored to produce monoaromatic chemicals and cyclic alkanes [7]. The authors reviewed the pre-treatment techniques to improve the product yields during the catalytic process. Another work by Ong et al. reviewed the biofuel production from various types of biomass using catalytic techniques [8]. The authors also discussed the catalytic effect of alkali and alkaline earth metals resulted in improved biochar yield and quality during the pyrolysis and torrefaction of biomass. Recently, Bhatt et al. reviewed refuse-derived fuel (RDF) from municipal solid waste through mechanical biological treatment and pyrolysis of RDF [9]. The authors also studied the effect of catalysts such as P, Ni, Co, and Mo modified zeolite catalysts on product distributions during the co-pyrolysis of RDF with different reactor technologies. A recent study by Alhazami et al. reviewed bioenergy from agricultural waste via thermochemical techniques [10]. The authors summarized the results of life cycle analysis models on different thermochemical processes. They discussed the environmental impacts of agricultural waste conversion into main products such as bio-oil, biochar, and biogas. Biochar applications as a catalyst derived from gasification and pyrolysis of biomass waste have been reviewed recently by Low et al. [11]. The authors presented the acidic, basic, and physical activation techniques to improve the bio-char for catalytic applications. The benefits, drawbacks, and limitations of bio-char in the environment, cost, and safety-related issues are also highlighted. In addition, the authors also reviewed the characterization techniques such as FTIR, XRD, TGA, and TPD for bio-char. Recently, the effect of operating conditions on product properties during the pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse with reactor configurations are reviewed by Miranda et al. [12]. The review demonstrated that sugarcane bagasse has a vast potential for the production of value-added chemicals in addition to the significant reduction in environmental pollution. Another recent study by Akhter et al. reviewed the applications of RH ash in the construction sector and renewable energy [13]. The authors emphasize RHA as a binder and additive in concrete and soil stabilization. Kumar et al. reviewed RHA applications for waste water treatment and found that RHA can replace expensive activated carbon. RHA has high silica content. The authors also pointed out that silica from RH has a stable market for steel and construction industries [14]. Hosan et al. presented extraction of silica from chemical and combustion techniques. The authors pointed out that the amorphous silica from RHA has a huge potential to develop various ceramic materials such as refractory, glass, whiteware, oxide and non-oxide ceramics, silica aerogel, and SiO2/C composites [15]. Another study by Abaide et al. reviewed the advantages and technical challenges for processing coproducts from RH and rice straw [16]. The authors presented the applications of rice coproducts in construction, biofuels production, and animal feed and fertilizer sectors. RHA applications in adsorption, production of carbon and silica-based materials are also discussed. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic reviews are available, particularly on RH valorization for producing value-added products using catalytic and non-catalytic techniques."
1,Rice husk,"1.1 Rice husk Production of rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the world's largest performed agricultural activities, lagging behind sugarcane and corn commodities [1]. Currently, 510.3 million tons of milled rice are produced worldwide in 2020–2021 [2]. China is the largest producer with 28.5%, India is the second largest with 24% followed by Indonesia and Bangladesh with 7%, Vietnam and Thailand with 5% and 4%, respectively [3]. Consequently, the production of co-products, such as RHs and rice straws, has also increased. It produces approximately 120 million tons of RH (20% of rice crop) per year during rice milling. The massive volume of the RH (RH) left behind after milling poses severe disposal problems and the methods of disposal vary from one geographic location to another. In most Asian countries, particularly India, farmers resort to open burning, resulting in severe air pollution, soil degradation, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the RH can be utilized in multiple sustainable ways to produce value-added products by thermal, biological, physical, and catalytic techniques."
2,Proximate and ultimate analysis,"1.2 Proximate and ultimate analysis Proximate and ultimate biomass analyses give key details on the composition, and depending on the source of cultivation, the products vary. The proximate analysis of rice is performed in a thermogravimetric analyzer based on GB/T 212–2001 [4], ASTM D3172–07a [5], GB/T 28731–2012 [6] standard methods. The proximate analysis shows percentages of moisture, volatile, ash, and fixed carbon (combustibles) present in biomass. RH's moisture, ash, and combustibles contents vary in the range of 4–13%, 12–23.5%, 71–78%, respectively [7–9]. The moisture is released when the biomass is heated at temperatures above 100–200 °C. Ash is the inorganic solid phase left after complete combustion. The inorganics consist of oxides of Na, K, Ca, Si, etc., and play a crucial role in pyrolysis. These elements act as catalysts for cracking reactions of volatiles generated during biomass pyrolysis. The combustibles consist of both volatiles as well as fixed carbon and are converted into H2, CO, CO2, H2O, and light and heavy hydrocarbons during the heat treatment. The ultimate analysis is carried out in an elemental analyzer. It gives elemental composition such as C, H, N, S, O. The C, H, S, N, and O contents in RH vary 37–54%, 4–7%, 0.1–0.61%, 0.14–2.17%, and 31–60%, respectively [7–9]. The oxygen content for RH is exceptionally high and affects the quality of bio-oil produced, making it highly acidic in nature. Oxygen is present in functional groups of complex organic compounds and also in the form of oxides of inorganic elements."
3,Rice husk composition,"1.3 Rice husk composition The composition of RH depends on the source and climatic location [10–13]. The three main components of RH are hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. The compositions of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin vary from 14.04% to 29.3%, 28.6–41.52%, and 12.84–33.67%, respectively. Hemicellulose consists of saccharides such as xylose, mannose, glucose, galactose, etc. It has a random amorphous structure and is rich in branches. Hemicellulose starts to decompose in a temperature range of 200–315 °C and releases oxygenated hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons are mainly methanol, acetic acids, acetone furfural, and some trace phenols. In catalytic pyrolysis, the acids and ketones are converted into aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). On the other hand, cellulose consists of a long polymer chain of glucose without branches, and it has a strong and ordered structure, due to which cellulose has higher thermal stability. Cellulose decomposes at a temperature of 315–400 °C to levoglucosan during the thermal treatment and is further fragmented into linear compounds such as furfural, acetone, ketones, and alcohols. Lignin has an aromatic backbone with various branches. The activity of chemical bonds in lignin covers a vast range due to which its degradation occurs from ambient temperature to 900 °C. Nevertheless, the side chains present can be converted by the catalytic pyrolysis process to other compounds."
4,Thermochemical conversion,"Thermochemical conversions are carried out at high temperatures (typically 300–1100 °C) for valorizing the biomass into biofuels, biochar, syngas, etc [14]. The thermochemical techniques are robust and more flexible to scale up than biological processes [15,16]. Gasification and pyrolysis are the two main thermochemical conversion techniques, others being liquefaction and direct combustion. These techniques are performed with and without catalysts to enhance the product yields. Operating conditions like temperature, feed rate, and gasifying flow rates are also adjusted to maximize the product yields."
5,Combustion,"2.1 Combustion The proximate analysis shows that RH contains 75% combustibles and 15% ash, considered to be a valuable feedstock to generate bioenergy. It can be combusted in vortex, cyclone, and fluidized bed combustors. The fluidized bed is a common choice when it comes to biomass combustion. RH being nongranular, flaky, and of cylindrical shape, is challenging to be fluidized. Generally, RH is fluidized with the help of solid particles such as silica and coal. Several research groups have been working to improve biomass combustion efficiency along with low emissions. For instance, Armesto et al. studied RH's combustion behavior in a bubbling fluidized bed combustor mixed with sand and reported 97.0–98.4% efficiency for all runs. The combustion efficiency increases with an increase in temperature and decreases with fluidization velocity. The increase in the temperature leads to better combustion as it is an endothermic process, and an increase in fluidization velocity leads to the increasing amount of particles with unburnt content leaving the combustor [17]. In the same way, Fang et al. studied the combustion of RH in a circulating fluidized bed gasifier and achieved a combustion efficiency above 97% [18]. RH has been used to meet the energy requirements of rice mills and used to provide electricity in rural areas [19–22]. The combustion of RH also produces low carbon ash containing more than 90 wt% of silica. The study by Rozainee et al. performed combustion of RH in a bench-scale fluidized bed condenser and reported 2.88% residual carbon at a temperature of 650 °C with a minimum fluidization velocity of 3.3 m/s [23]. In another study by Fernandes et al. characterized RH ash (RHA) produced from three combustion techniques, namely moving grate furnace (RHA-MG), fluidized bed (RHA-FB), and suspension/entrained (RHA-S) combustion. The highest specific surface area of ash of 39.27 m2/g was obtained in RHA-MG, implying its application as an adsorbent. The RHA-FB contained the highest percentage of SiO2 of 96.71% and the lowest weight loss in TGA of 3.09%. The studies imply that RHA-FB can be used as a filler in polymeric composites and synthesize ceramic compounds [24]."
6,Gasification,"2.2 Gasification Gasification is a thermochemical process that converts biomass into gaseous components [25]. The gasifiers are classified into fixed bed, fluidized bed, and entrained bed gasifiers. The fixed bed gasifiers include downdraft, updraft, horizontal draft, etc. The fluidized bed gasifiers include a circulated fluidized bed, double circulated fluidized bed, bubbling fluidized bed, etc. In this process, the biomass is subjected to high temperatures in the presence of a gasification agent, usually air or air with steam, to produce high hydrogen yields and rich syngas. Three primary processes are involved in gasification, namely pyrolysis, oxidation, and reduction. As soon as the biomass enters into the gasifier, it undergoes pyrolysis. The volatiles generated from pyrolysis and the char undergo oxidation reactions in the presence of oxygen. The tar, hydrocarbons, and char are gasified by carbon dioxide and water vapor in the reduction zone to produce fuel gas [26,27]. The gasification of RH produces a complex, volatile mixture of aromatics ranging from mono to heavy cyclic and oxygen-containing aromatics, along with high CO and H2 seldom contains hydrocarbons such as methane, ethylene [28]. Higher heating value is one of the most critical parameters that indicate the higher energy content of biomass. The higher heating values of RH gasification vary from 14,508 to 15,728 MJ/kg [29]. The low heating value of the gas decreases with high ER due to the low amounts of H2 and CO with high CO2 content. Equivalence ratio (ER) is an important parameter to improve gas yields in air gasification. It is defined as the ratio of air-fuel to the theoretical air-fuel ratio. The lower ER indicates that minimum air is required to support the endothermic reactions and maintain the reactor's temperature of bed needed. The heating values of the producer gas increase in steam gasification due to the high H2 content. RH's steam gasification is an economical process that results in rich H2 streams with high heating values [51,52]. RH gasification is also carried out at various pressures of 1–4 bar and found that gas yield and carbon conversion efficiency increases with increasing temperature, however, less significant in H2 yield [31]. The condensable gaseous oils have high viscosity and low heating value. The use of these oils causes severe blockage of pipes, engines, and catalyst deactivation. Table 1 shows the various gasifier configurations which were explored for RH gasification. 2.2.1 Gasifying agents Air, nitrogen, steam, CO2, or a mixture of these were used as gasifying agents for the RH gasification at 484–1100 °C. Generally, most gasifiers are operated with air as an oxidizing agent due to the easy availability and self-sustaining process. However, the gas has a low heating value due to the high N2 content. The selectivity of gasification reactions is determined by the gasifying agent employed; it also affects the product composition and heating value. For instance, RH gasification in the presence of air, the composition of gaseous products varies in the range 6.54–13.6% for H2, 7–23.75% for CO, 12.9–21.11% for CO2, and 1.5–10.8% for CH4 [4,5,43,31,34–37,40–42]. It is evident from Table 2 that the gasification of RH produces high amounts of CO2 due to the oxidation reactions were boosted by the excess air. However, the higher CO2 content reduces the higher heating value. Enhanced gas yields and reduced ash and tar yields are observed in fluidized bed gasifiers due to the cracking of liquids and enhanced char reactions at high temperatures [44]. The use of steam results in high H2 yields and higher heating value, resulting in high tar content. While using air or oxygen as the gasifying medium, the partial oxidation reactions and exothermic combustion reactions generate most of the heat required to drive the reactions. But the air as gasifying agent, the gas heating values are relatively low due to nitrogen dilution [45]. When steam is used with air, it acts as a thermal moderator and a reagent in gasification. The calorific value of the product gas increases in the presence of steam [46]. For instance, air and steam mixture is used as a gasifying agent in a fluidized bed and produces a rich hydrogen stream at 800 °C [37]. The presence of steam, the combustible species such as CO, H2, CH4, and C2H6. While the H2 content increases with an increase in steam due to the water gas shift reaction, the CO content is maximum at an optimum air-steam mixture. The optimum range is a balance between CO producing reactions. Using N2 with steam as a gasifying agent produces high yields of H2 with H2/CO is 1.75, and low yields of CO2 [38]. As seen from Table 1, the gas yields depend on the type of gasifying agent used in RH combustion. Most of the product yields are dependent on the operating temperature of the gasifier. Fig. 1 shows the effect of temperature on synthetic gas composition during the gasification of RH. In general, the syngas composition increases with increasing temperature due to the endothermic reactions. For instance, Karmakar et al. showed the highest syngas (CO + H2) composition compared to other research groups. The highest composition was due to the auto-thermal gasifier configuration [34]. Another study by Jiang et al. found the syngas composition increases with a temperature range of 540–620 °C in a fluidized bed gasifier but decreases after 620 °C. The decrease in syngas composition is attributed to the coke formation at 620 °C [33]. Another work by Zhao et al. found that water gas shift reaction was responsible for increased syngas composition due to moisture in the RH [47]. Yin et al. too found the gas composition increases with temperature; there was a slight decrease in composition from 820 to 830 °C attributed to changes in the stability of the feed system and RH properties [35]. 2.2.2 Products distribution with catalyst Catalysts are often used in gasification to increase reaction rates and enhance the yields of targeted products such as hydrogen or syngas. Catalysts are used to promote or suppress the formation of undesired reactions. Additionally, the tar formation is minimized by employing acid site catalysts such as zeolite or alumina-based supports. The tar products undergo several simultaneous reactions during gasification, such as thermal cracking, dry reforming, steam reforming, water-gas shift, carbon formation, etc., and these compounds are converted to lighter hydrocarbons [48]. The major challenge in tar cracking is the coke deposition on the catalyst due to polymerization of the free radicals on the catalyst surface, which eventually reduces the catalyst activity. Several research groups explored to enhance the syngas composition in the presence of catalysts during RH gasification. The catalyst is employed in multiple ways, such as mixing with the fluidizing media in a fluidized bed reactor, mixing with biomass feed in a drop-type reactor, or having a catalyst bed in a fixed bed reactor. The Ni-based catalysts are widely explored to produce rich H2 streams during the steam gasification of RH. The Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts enhance the cracking reactions and result in high H2 yield. After the steam reforming, water-gas shift reactions are carried out on ZnO, and CuO catalysts further enhance H2 yields [49]. The catalysts such as dolomite, Fe, Zn, Co, Cu, and Ca were also explored to improve the H2 or syngas yields. Table 2 shows the different catalysts employed to enhance the syngas yield by various research groups. It is evident from Table 2 that the composition of the gas yield depends on reactor configuration, catalyst, and operating temperature, and steam to biomass ratio (S/B), ER [50,54,56–61]. For example, the nano NiO/ γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed upgraded gas quality, high H2 yield, and 99% tar removal efficiency [50]. Bench-scale bubbling fluidized bed is explored for RH gasification at ER ratio of 0.3 in the presence of dolomite as a catalyst and found that 41–46% tar reduction in desired gas [58]. The fixed bed gasifier with CO2 as a gasifying agent is explored Fe2O3, CoO, NiO, CuO, and ZnO on alumina catalysts and found that ZnO is most active at a pressure of 0.1 MPa, and 800 °C [59]. Another study by Makwana et al. performed air gasification of RH with dolomite as a catalyst in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor with various equivalent ratios. With an increase in ER, CO, H2, and CH4 concentrations decreased and were found maximum at ER of 0.3. Thus, low ER in the presence of dolomite catalyst results in better quality producer gas [51]. The tar is a problematic compound, and its yields decrease with the addition of catalysts. For example, Xia et al. performed sorption enhanced chemical looping gasification using Nix Ca1−x O (where x = 0–1 mol of nickel nitrate) and found that the tar and char yield decreased, and the gas yield increased. The highest yield for gas was obtained at an optimum Ni/Ca ratio in the catalyst at x = 0.5. Also, the H2 and CO yields were highest at these conditions [53]. Similar experiments on chemical looping gasification were performed by Huang et al. using Fe-based oxygen carrier for syngas production [62] and using Si, Fe, and alumina to support hydrogen production [63]. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) is an effective technique for producing syngas or rich hydrogen streams from low-grade biomass and high moisture content. Compared to the conventional methods, SCWG has high reaction efficiency and high H2 selectivity and is considered the most economical process [2]. Only a few studies reported on SCWG of RH. For instance, Bakari et al. studied the effect of temperature, RT, and feed concentration of RH in SCWG in an autoclave. The studies show that high temperature, longer RT, and low concentrations favour high gas yields and low tar yields and reported gas volume of 423 mL/g at 500 °C and 120 mins [2]. In another study by Basu et al. performed the SCWG of RH at 400–680 °C, and found that high temperatures and low concentrations are suitable for high carbon conversion of biomass, and there is no significant effect of particle size on conversion [3]."
7,Pyrolysis,"2.3 Pyrolysis Pyrolysis is a thermochemical process that breaks down biomass into various products in the absence of oxygen. It produces three products: bio-oil, char, and pyrolytic gas, and yields of these products depend on operating conditions like heating rate and final temperature. These can be summarized as [64] i) Bio-char can be maximized at a low heating rate and low temperature with high residence times. ii) High liquid yields can be optimized at a high heating rate, intermediate pyrolysis temperature, and at very low residence time. iii)The Gas yield can be maximized at a higher heating rate, a higher temperature, and a shorter residence time. The pyrolysis technique is further classified into slow and fast pyrolysis based on the residence of biomass inside the reactor. The product yields depend on heating rate, inert gas flow rate, biomass feeding rate, and type of reactor. The inert gases that are common for pyrolysis are nitrogen, helium, and argon. For slow pyrolysis, the heating rate is usually less than 100 °C/min, and the inert gas flow rate is less than 100 mL/min, and the most common reactor configuration applied is a fixed bed reactor. And for fast pyrolysis, the heating rate is more than 100 °C/min, and inert gas flow rates are much greater than 100 mL/min; usually, 500 mL/min, resulting in short residence times [65,66]. The product yields of RH pyrolysis also depend on the pre-treatment technique and type of reactor used. 2.3.1 Pretreatment of RH RH contains high ash content, which requires pretreatment to improve the product yields. Pretreatment of RH enhanced the results of targeted products such as bio-oil, biochar, pyrolytic gas, or even a combination of them. The inorganic metals such as Na, Ca, K, and Mg are present in the oxide forms, and also a high percentage of SiO2 is present. These compounds are removed by treating with simple acids such as HCl, HF, H3PO4, etc. Otherwise, techniques such as torrefaction are applied. The pretreatment can change the chemical compositions of products and their yield percentages. For instance, Gupta et al. studied the effect of temperature and pretreatment of RH. They found that bio-oil yield improved after the pretreatment and claimed that cellulose removed (34 wt%) RH contributes to lower gas yields [67]. The study by Zhang et al. found that heating value is increased after treating RH with aqueous fractions of bio-oil obtained from microwave pyrolysis and with HCl in TGA [6]. Another study by Shen et al. prepared a KOH-activated biochar via CO2 pyrolysis for phenol adsorption and found that KOH activation resulted in a significant increase in specific surface area char [68]. Torrefaction is a mild form of pyrolysis in which biomass is subjected to much lower temperatures ranging from 200 °C to 300 °C under an inert atmosphere. The pre-treated biomass, when subjected to pyrolysis, provides enhanced product yields. For instance, Chen et al. studied the torrefaction of RH in the temperature range of 200–300 °C. They found that 250 °C is the optimum temperature to improve the combustion characteristics, energy density, and low heating value [69]. Acid washing followed by torrefaction of RH removes the alkaline earth metals and enhances deoxygenation, resulting in high energy density [69]. Another study by Zhang et al. found the char increases by 52.12% after treating the RH with acid followed by torrefaction. The increase in char yield is attributed to the cross-linking and carbonization reactions and increased alkali and alkaline earth metals [70–72]. 2.3.2 Reactor configurations The fixed bed reactor is widely used for either slow or fast pyrolysis of biomass. The feed material is fixed inside the reactor and heated to the desired temperature with the selected heating rate. This configuration eliminates biomass losses compared to other designs, where a small fraction of biomass is lost on the surfaces of the reactors. But employing a fixed bed reactor for catalytic pyrolysis poses a severe threat to the catalyst activity and results in catalyst deactivation with time-on-stream. A fluidized bed requires a fluidizing media like sand, and the heat is usually provided by inert gases such as N2, He, and Ar, and heated to the desired temperature. The biomass is dropped inside the reactor in a drop-type pyrolyzer after the pyrolysis temperature is reached, resulting in low residence times of the pyrolysis vapors. Another reactor configuration is the TGA-MS, in which the thermogravimetric analyser is coupled with a mass spectrometer. This configuration allows monitoring the mass loss and the composition of gases released during the reaction [73,74]. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis is also explored for RH and provides high heating rates and easy control [75]."
8,Slow pyrolysis,"2.4 Slow pyrolysis The slow pyrolysis of biomass is carried out to produce a high char yield [76,77], bio-oil, and biogas [78]. In slow pyrolysis, the biomass spends longer residence times in the reactor to achieve high char and biogas yields. The temperature plays a significant role in producing high yields of desired products [79]. With an increase in temperature above 500 °C, secondary cracking of pyrolysis vapors occurs, resulting in lower bio-oil yield and enhanced pyrolytic gas yield [80]. The fixed bed reactor is the most common type of reactor employed for slow pyrolysis of RH. Numerous research groups carried out the slow pyrolysis of RH from 4 °C to 60 °C/ min heating rate (HR), at various residence times (RT) and a temperature range of 300–850 °C. Table 3 shows gas, char, and bio-oil yields during the slow pyrolysis of RH at various operating conditions. High HR, small particle sizes, and high temperatures produce high bio-oil and low char yields [81]. Table 3 clearly shows that high gas yields are favorable at high HR and intermediate temperatures [80]. In contrast, a longer residence time (RT) is favorable to produce high char yields due to the enhanced secondary reactions of recondensation and re-polymerization of volatiles. For instance, char formation and high char yields are favorable at a low heating rate of 4 °C/min - 20 °C/min and a temperature of 400–550 °C [67,82]. High gas yields are observed at a heating rate of 20 °C- 60 °C and a temperature of 300 °C – 600 °C due to tar cracking and higher hydrocarbons [80,83]. 2.4.1 Product distribution without a catalyst As seen from the composition, RH contains three main components hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. Generally, hemicellulose decomposes near 260–280 °C, Cellulose at around 340 °C, and lignin from 400 °C to 600 °C [89]. The product yields are significantly dependent on the final temperature of pyrolysis. Figs. 2, 3, and 4 show the effect of temperature on product distributions of bio-oil, pyrolytic gas, and char during slow pyrolysis of RH. 2.4.1.1 Bio-oil production Bio-oil yield depends on the biomass's volatile matter, and it contains up to 76% of volatiles. Bio-oil is a black tarry liquid that consists of a complex mixture of organic compounds containing a high percentage of water (typically 20–35%) with lower calorific values than conventional fuels [90]. High water content in the bio-oil reduces combustion rates, ignition delays, and adiabatic flame temperatures [91]. The bio-oil is acidic in nature, and its components include acids, ketones, alcohols, esters, sugars, phenols, phenol derivatives, etc. Pyrolytic bio-oil suffers from unstable physical and chemical properties, high viscosity, high oxygen and water content [92]. Bio-oil is the targeted product in pyrolysis and is a source of many specialty chemicals. It can be upgraded to value-added chemicals or blended with commercial fuels without significant performance loss of engines. However, bio-oil yield in slow pyrolysis is low due to the low heating rates and high residence time. The low bio-oil yield is due to the secondary cracking of hydrocarbons and increases the yield of gas products at a low heating rate and high residence time [93]. Several research groups explored the slow pyrolysis of RH and effect of temperature on bio-oil yield is shown in Fig. 2. The bio-oil yield increases with a temperature [81], and a maximum of 38.1% is observed at 450 °C at an HR of 20 °C/min by Biswas et al. Another study by Gui et al.[87] found that the highest bio-oil yield of 45.45% is achieved at 550 °C and observed low yields at lower temperatures due to the low temperature for incomplete pyrolysis. In contrast to the previous studies, Gupta et al. [67] found that no change in bio-oil yield up to 400 °C and later increases with an increase in temperature. The author claimed that this is due to the fuel's minimum ignition energy after 400 °C. The bio-oil yield depends on the heating rate, temperature, and RT during the slow pyrolysis of RH. For instance, bio-oil is not detected when the heating rate is low, 5 °C/min- 10 °C/min, and at a temperature of 300–400 °C, and the highest bio-oil yield of 20–30% is obtained at a heating rate of 20 °C/min, the residence time of 1 h, and 500 °C [83]. Another study by Natarajan et al. observed that smaller particles reduce the bio-oil yield due to the longer residence time favoring the cracking of heavier hydrocarbons [80]. In contrast to the above findings, Prabhakar et al. carried out the RH pyrolysis at a temperature of 400–550 °C and found a maximum bio-oil yield of 8.5 wt% at 400 °C and a minimum bio-oil yield of 6.8 wt% at 550 °C [94]. Fermanelli et al. carried out the pyrolysis of RH in the temperature range of 350–650 °C and found that bio-oil is maximum at 550 °C [91]. From the above studies, 550 °C is the optimum pyrolysis temperature to produce high bio-oil yields from RH slow pyrolysis. 2.4.1.2 Pyrolytic gas Pyrolytic gas consists of H2, CO, CO2, CH4, and C2-C4 HCs. Fig. 3 shows the effect of temperature on pyrolytic gas yields during the slow pyrolysis of RH. It is indicated that gas yield increases with increasing temperature due to the secondary cracking of higher hydrocarbons [67,81,83,94]. For instance, Natarajan et al. [80] carried out RH slow pyrolysis at HR of 60 °C/min and temperature of 300–500 °C and found that the gas yield increased with temperature. Gupta et al. have shown low gas yields due to the low HR of 4 °C/min and at a low residence time of 30 min [67]. The highest gas yields are observed at temperature o 400 °C, with HR of 20 °C/min and at a residence time of 2 h [83]. 2.4.1.3 Bio-char Bio-char yield is favorable at a low to moderate HR and low temperature due to the low valorization rates [67,94]. However, the char produced at lower temperatures has a high carbon content. As temperature increases, different components of RH starts to decompose, and char yield decreases. Char with low carbon content is favored at temperatures above 500 °C [89]. Fig. 4 shows the effect of pyrolysis temperature on bio-char yield. It is indicated that char yield decreases with increasing temperature [67,80,83,94]. For instance, Vieira et al. [83] observed that the optimal temperature range for biochar production is 400–500 °C. In another work by Biswas et al.[81], found that the yield was maximum at 300 °C (43.3 wt%) and decreased when temperature increased, with the lowest (35 wt%) at 450 °C. The author claimed that the decrease in yield from 43.3 wt% to 37.2 wt% is due to cellulose decomposition around 340 °C. The char yield increase with increasing particle size due to the high-temperature gradient between the surface and inner core of the particles led to incomplete pyrolysis [80]. Among all studies listed in Fig. 4, Gupta et al. [88] found that char yield decreases with increasing temperature and have shown the highest char yield of 65% lignin removed RH at 300 °C. k. A lower temperature favors char yield due to the low valorization rate. 2.4.2 Product distribution with catalyst The catalyst plays an essential role in upgrading vapors generated from the RH pyrolysis [95]. A rich hydrogen stream can be produced by catalytic stem reforming of volatiles generated from the slow pyrolysis of RH. The two dominant reactions of steam reforming and water gas shift reactions occur during catalytic steam reforming. The hydrogen concentration is limited ( ≤ 70 % ) due to the reverse water gas shift reaction, side reactions, and carbon formation [82]. For catalytic pyrolysis, Ni, Co, Ag, Zn are dispersed on highly porous SiO2, Al2O3, zeolite supports [10,49,94,96–102], and RH biochar and coal ash as catalysts are also explored to produce bio-oil [103] and hydrogen [104]. The steam to biomass ratio (S/B) is optimized to get the maximum H2 yield. An increase in steam results in better hydrogen yield according to the reaction's kinetics. At a higher S/B, the steam carries away some heat and a lower temperature in the reactor. Also, a reverse water gas shift reaction occurs at very high temperatures (>1100 °C), resulting in lower hydrogen yield. 2.4.2.1 In-situ Catalytic slow pyrolysis In-situ catalytic pyrolysis experiments are carried in a single or a two-stage reactor. The catalyst is mixed with biomass at the desired ratio (B/C) and loaded as a fixed bed in a single-stage reactor. In a two-stage reactor, RH is pyrolyzed in the first stage, and pyrolysis volatiles are reformed in the second stage of the reactor, where the catalyst is loaded as a fixed bed. The volatiles generated from the first stage were directed towards the catalyst bed with the help of inert gas. In-situ catalysis pyrolysis, single or two-stage reactor is maintained at the same temperature, and this temperature may not be the optimum condition for the catalyst performance. Also, the coke formation on the catalyst is high, leads to catalyst deactivation, and needs frequent catalyst regeneration. Table 4 shows the in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of RH performed by various research groups. For more H2 yields, Ni and Ni-dolomite catalysts are explored due to their lower cost, availability and enhance the cracking reactions [96–99]. For example, Williams et al. performed in-situ steam reforming (SR) of vapors from slow pyrolysis of RH in the presence of Ni loaded dolomite catalyst and found a maximum H2 yield of 30.62 mmoles/g at 1050 °C [97]. A similar study by Akubo et al. found that hydrogen yield increased significantly from 6.16 mmol/g to 18.22 mmol/g on Ni-based catalysts [96]. The amount of oxygenated compounds are reduced in the presence of ZnO catalyst. For instance, Zhou et al. studied the effect of ZnO catalyst for bio-oil upgradation. They found that bio-oil yield decreases 47.17–41.17 wt% with improved bio-oil quality with low carboxylic acid percentage [101]. Slow pyrolysis of RH mixed with ZnO and observed improved syngas gas yield [100]. 2.4.2.2 Ex-situ catalytic slow pyrolysis In ex-situ catalysis, the vapors released from pyrolysis are directed towards the second reactor under similar or different operating conditions. The ex-situ configuration is less complex than the in-situ catalytic pyrolysis. In ex-situ configuration, the catalyst is placed in a second reactor, and the reactor is operated at the optimum conditions. Meanwhile, the char can be separated while transferring the vapors to the catalytic reactor, which improves the catalyst activity [106]. However, few studies are explored the ex-situ catalytic reforming of volatiles generated during the slow pyrolysis o RH and listed in Table 5 [120–123]. For instance, Jung et al. observed a higher yield of 61.54% on Co// γ-Al2O3. The enhanced H2 yield is due to the dehydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions on the Co catalyst. The authors also found that cracking of pyrolytic volatiles results in higher syngas gas yield in the presence of CO2 [102]. The Ni catalysts are selective for catalyzing the alcoholic intermediates and water gas shift reactions resulting in high H2 content in syngas [49]. Pyrolysis bio-oil contains high oxygenated compounds, and these are oils upgraded in the presence of zeolite-based catalysts. The zeolites are acidic supports and enhance the reactions of deoxygenation, dehydration, and decarboxylation. The oxygen-containing compounds are converted into CO2, CO, and H2O. For instance, Bakar et al. studied the effect of ZSM-5, Al-MCM-41, Al-MSU-F on a wash coated monolith and found that bio-oil yield 39.98 wt% was maximum on Al-MCM-41 catalyst. But ZSM-5 produced the highest aromatics, such as benzene(B), toluene (T), xylenes, ethylbenzenes (XE), and styrene [10]. Raymundo et al. upgraded the bio-oil in the presence of switchgrass biochar and found that the biochar effectively increases the BTEX, naphthalenes, and phenols content in bio-oil [103]."
9,Fast pyrolysis,"2.5 Fast pyrolysis In fast pyrolysis, the biomass residence time is significantly less typically in the order of a few seconds with high HR. The product yields are also dependent on feed rate (FR), gas flow rate (GR), and particle size. Due to the low RT, the vapors generated from the fast pyrolysis do not undergo any secondary cracking reactions. The short RT increases the condensable fractions in the vapors, resulting in a high bio-oil yield. Table 6 shows the fast pyrolysis of RH carried out at various operating conditions. The pyrolytic bio-oil contains sub-micron-level particles and creates problems for direct utilization in combustion engines. The hot vapor filtration technique is used to remove the particles from bio-oil. Chen et al. incorporated the hot vapor filtration (HVF) to remove the micron solid particles during the RH fast pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor and found that bio-oil yield is 39.5% with significantly less ash content [107]. The high bio-oil yield of 70 wt% is reported at 450 °C in a conical sprouted bed reactor with continuous char removal. The conical sprouted bed reactor is more effective than the fluidized bed due to low heat and mass transfer resistances, promoting devolatilization reactions at low RT [108]. 2.5.1 Effect of temperature on product yields (without catalyst) 2.5.1.1 Bio-oil Bio-oil is the targeted product in the fast pyrolysis of RH, and its observed yields are in the range 36–70 wt%. Bio-oil is formed from reactions of fragmentation and depolymerization of biomass constituents. It comprises phenols, cresols, guaiacols, benzenodiols, and ketones with lower amounts of saccharides, aldehydes. However, it has high water and oxygen content of 20–30 wt%, 45–50 wt%., respectively. The composition of water and oxygen compounds depends on the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin content in the RH. For higher bio-oil yields, fast pyrolysis of RH is carried out at optimum operating conditions such as temperature, GR and FR, and RT. However, the quality of bio-oil is significantly dependent on the temperature alone [7]. Fig. 5 shows the effect of temperature on bio-oil yield and found that bio-oil yield is maximum at a temperature range of 450–500 °C. For example, Ji-lu et al. performed RH fast pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor. They reported a high bio-oil yield is 56% at 460 °C; further increasing temperature decreases the bio-oil yield due to the secondary cracking of condensable vapors [17]. In a recent study by Goutam et al., bio-oil yield is a maximum of 41.76 wt% at 550 °C due to char conversion into other forms and then decreased with an increase in temperature due to secondary cracking the vapors [129]. Higher operating temperatures are unfavorable for high bio-oil yields and reported low bio-oil yields above 500 °C [7,11,110,111]. A similar study by Tsai et al. found that the bio-oil yield increases with temperature and a maximum of 36.54 wt% at 500 °C. Due to the low RT further increase in temperature, bio-oil yield is more or less the same [112]. 2.5.1.2 Pyrolytic gas The pyrolytic gas mainly contains CO, CO2, H2, and lower amounts of C1- C3 hydrocarbons [114]. Fig. 6 shows effect of temperature on RH fast pyrolysis. The gas yield increases with increasing temperature due to secondary cracking of volatiles and the decomposition of char. For instance, Williams et al. found an increase in gas yield with temperature with the maximum yield at 600 °C of 34.5 wt% [11]. Gautam et al. found that the gas yield was constant up to 550 °C and increased, with the highest yield of 27.74 wt% at 650 °C [111], and similar gas yields trends reported by Heo et al. [7]. 2.5.1.3 Bio-char Biochar is a valuable product produced during the fast pyrolysis of RH, and its yield decreases with increasing temperature, as shown in Fig. 7. For instance, Williams et al. found that the char yield decreased with increasing temperature [11]. Another study by Gautam et al. found that the char yield continuously decreased with temperature from 45.72% at 450 °C to 37.43% at 650 °C. At higher temperatures, the secondary decomposition of char increased, leading to lower yield [111]. High Char yields are reported for smaller particle sizes due to low heat and mass transfer resistances. For example, char yield decreased significantly from 55.94% to 44.48%, with the particle size from 0.50 mm to 0.125 mm [112]. 2.5.2 Product distribution with catalyst Fast pyrolysis products contain a large liquid fraction (about 75% based on biomass) called bio-oil. However, bio-oil quality is lower than petroleum-based oil because they contain a large amount of oxygen and water [115]. Bio-oil has low heating value and low thermal and chemical stability due to the high oxygen content. Bio-oil is an acidic combustible liquid and contains more than 300 compounds which include large fraction of unsaturated compounds that cause instability under storage conditions [116]. Bio-oil upgradation techniques are needed to meet the standards of petroleum-based fuels. The bio-oil can be upgraded by two methods, namely hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and catalytic cracking using solid acid catalysts. HDO involves the removal of oxygen at high H2 pressure in the presence of sulfide CoMo and NiMo based catalysts [117–119]. Both HDO and zeolite cracking methods were studied under various reaction conditions. Zeolites based catalysts are commercialized for the upgradation of petroleum feedstocks to produce high-quality fuels [116,120,121]. In recent years, zeolites attracted much attention for the transformation of bio-oils to value-added products such as aromatics. Due to the high acidic content of zeolites catalysts, cracking reactions are enhanced over zeolite catalysts, and oxygen is removed in the form of non-condensable gases such as H2O, CO, or CO2. The upgraded bio-oil is rich in benzene, toluene, xylene, and other aromatic compounds. Aromatic hydrocarbons have high octane numbers and are used as additives in gasoline for octane enhancers. Moreover, aromatics can be used as raw materials for the processing of polymers and value-added products. Generally, the upgradation of bo-oil produced from fast pyrolysis is carried out either in in-situ or ex-situ catalytic reforming systems. 2.5.2.1 In-situ fast pyrolysis In this process, fast catalytic pyrolysis is carried out in a single reactor or two-stage reactor. In a single reactor setup, the biomass and catalyst are mixed and placed as a packed bed, fluidized or dropped from the top of the reactor at the desired temperature. In the second configuration, the reactor system was divided into two zones: the first zone for fast pyrolysis of biomass, and the second zone is packed with the catalyst particles. Several research groups explored the bio-oil upgradation and syngas or hydrogen production from volatiles generated from fast pyrolysis of RH, as shown in Table 7. It is evident from Table 8, bio-oil from fast pyrolysis contains a large portion of oxygenated compounds. The zeolites or transition metal catalysts significantly reduce the presence of oxygenated compounds. For example, Naqvi et al. upgraded the volatiles in the presence of H-ZSM-5. They found that bio-oil yield decreases with a catalyst to RH ratio and bio-oil has high aromatic content of phenol, phenolic compounds, and less carbonyl and acidic contents at a C/B of 0.5 [122]. Another study by Li et al. prepared that catalysts treated with TPAOH result in less coke deposition, improved bio-oil yield of 41.5% with the highest amounts of benzene, toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene at a 2 mol/l TPAOH concentration [129]. H-ZSM-5 is widely explored for the production of aromatics from fast pyrolysis of biomass [130]. For instance, MCM-41 plays a vital role in the deterioration of oxygenated compounds in bio-oil. For example, Li et al. prepared the HZSM-5 as a core with MCM-41 as a shell and performed the fast pyrolysis of RH in a Py-GC/MS. They found that the maximum percentage of aromatics and olefins is 40% at 600 °C [125]. For aromatics production, zeolite supports are the most effective for cracking higher hydrocarbons and reducing oxygenated compounds [11,123,131]. Furthermore, Zhao et al. compared zeolite catalyst supports such as ZSM-5, H-ZSM-5, β-zeolite, MCM-41, and SBA-15 and found ZSM-5 to be the most effective for aromatic production with yields up to 39% and selectivity of more than 85% [132]. 2.5.2.2 Ex-situ fast pyrolysis In Ex-situ fast pyrolysis, two reactors are connected in series and maintained at the same or different temperatures. Fast pyrolysis is performed in the first reactor, and the second reactor is packed with catalyst and used for the upgradation of bio-oil or to produce rich hydrogen or syngas. Table 8 shows the ex-situ techniques performed by several research groups and mainly focussed on hydrogen production. For instance, Liu et al. studied steam reforming of tar generated from fast pyrolysis of RH using a LaNiO3 on MCM-41 support to produce hydrogen at the temperature range of 500–900 °C. The S/C is varied from 0.6 to 1. The pyrolysis was carried out at 450 °C, and the highest hydrogen concentration of 58% is maximum at 700 °C with S/C of 0.8 and a catalyst loading of 0.1 mol LaNiO3/MCM. Above 900 °C, the perovskite structure was destroyed; thus, 800 °C was chosen as the best temperature for catalytic steam reforming. Besides, S/C ratio above 0.8 resulted in lower hydrogen concentration because beyond the S/C ratio of 0.8, and the steam carried away heat from the system resulting in lower temperatures in the reactor [133]. Bio-oil obtained from fast pyrolysis is a specialty chemical with many potential applications such as conventional fuel replacement for automobiles, sources for many pharmaceutical compounds like levoglucosan, and solvents such as benzene, toluene, xylene, etc. Zheng and Kwong [138] studied the application of fast pyrolysis derived RH bio-oil in boilers. They developed a spray combustion system comprising an atomizer nozzle and combustion chamber. Steady combustion temperatures above 1400 °C were obtained after 40 min. With the increase in equivalence ratios, the CO concentrations increased, and the measured SOx concentrations were very low (<30 ppm). The authors showed the potential use of bio-oil to replace diesel and gas for onsite power generation and heating. However, using bio-oils directly as a liquid fuel has many challenges; it shows excessive ignition delay and must be preheated to ignite reliably. Due to these issues, they are either emulsified with fuels such as diesel [139–142] and biodiesel [143–147]or blended with methanol and ethanol. For instance, Chiaramonti et al. [139] produced stable emulsions of bio-oil with diesel fuel. The authors found that the emulsions were more stable than bio-oil, and with an increase in bio-oil content, the emulsion's viscosity increased. Other properties of emulsions of bio-oil with diesel fuel, such as lubrication ability [140,142] and its application as a stable fuel [141] are also studied. Bio-oil is also explored as jet fuel. For instance, Chen et al. [148] upgraded the bio-oil into jet fuel by hydroprocessing and hydrocracking techniques. The final oil comprised alkanes and cycloalkanes, which dissolved in the conventional jet fuel (JP-5)."
10,Other novel conversion techniques,"2.6 Other novel conversion techniques The other novel techniques such as microwave and solar assisted pyrolysis for RH conversion have shown in table 9. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) is a new technology to convert biomass into valuable products. The bio-oils obtained from MAP have HHV and low oxygen content. MAP-assisted pyrolysis is a process where radiation is transferred into thermal energy to RH. Various frequency ranges in the microwaves can produce different functional groups in bio-oil, which induces different reactions for each product formation. Microwave absorbents can increase heating rates and pyrolysis temperature and reduce residence time. More reaction time inside the reactor can reduce the bio-oil yield because of secondary cracking as more interaction is happening between the biomass and the microwave field. Microwave absorbers increase the bio-oil yield as the various absorption additives like carbon, Al2O3, Fe, SiC, and activated carbon are used [149]. For instance, Fe powder can increase the bio-oil percentage up to 38 wt%, but oil quality is poor due to water and acetic acid formed during secondary cracking [14]. Using carbon increases the gas yield up to 54 wt%, and Al2O3 increases char yield up to 64.1%[14]. It is also found that the power significantly affects the bio-oil formation as it affects the temperature. An increase in microwave energy absorption is due to an increase in microwave power. An increase in microwave energy absorption leads to higher HR and HHV. Bio-oil yield increases with increasing temperature, which enhances the devolatilization, depolymerization, and decarboxylation reactions. Further increase in temperature, bio-oil yield decreases due to the secondary cracking reactions, resulting in high gas yields. Microwave torrefactions is another technique to produce high quality bio-oils. The bio-oil quality depends on the microwave power and RT. Carbonization and volatilization are the main reactions taking place along with torrefaction process. At moderate microwave power, water content in biomass will affect the reaction performance because water is a good microwave absorbent. Water can absorb the microwave energy and will convert into the vapour phase. At higher moisture content with low or moderate microwave power results in low temperature and effect the reactions. Bio-oil calorific values vary according to the microwave power and RT. Higher the power higher and smaller size particles enhance the bio-oil yield. Solar pyrolysis is also an efficient and nonpolluting technology with low cost equipment as other conventional techniques require external energy. Solar pyrolysis is exceptionally eco-friendly as it uses direct solar radiation for pyrolysis heating and is also a very energy-efficient technique. Solar energy can provide high temperatures with fast HR. The two main categories of solar pyrolysis are partial heating and continuous heating by solar energy. A partial heating system is worked initially by solar heating and later the pyrolysis is carried out electricity. A continuous heating system provides a solar heating with biomass or electricity that continuously performs a pyrolysis process. Solar energy concentrators are used for converging the energy or for heating the reactor. Only few studies are reported on solar pyrolysis of RH [150]."
11,Applications of biochar,
12,Biochar for soil remediation,"3.1 Biochar for soil remediation Biochar produced from the fast pyrolysis of RH, rich in inorganic minerals and carbon content, is one of the most desired pyrolysis products. The biochar can improve the organic carbon, which helps retain moisture and nutrients and decrease soil bulk density and increase soil pH [154–156]. The biochar contains approximately 20% silica which also helps in the growth of the grass. The soil quality has shown higher electrical conductivity than the regular soil after the tsunami hitting the Indian Ocean in 2004. The remediation of tsunami-affected soil was treated with RH biochar and found an improved grain yield compared to the untreated soil [154]. In Indonesia, the acid sulfate soil had been treated with RH char and found that the increase in cations adsorption resulted in improved rice growth in plant height, many tillers, and dry weight [131]. Another study by Ghorbani et al. used the RH biochar as soil remediation and found improved soil aggregation and reduced nitrate leaching [155]. Eduah et al. produced the bio-char at various pyrolysis temperatures and found that char produced at 300–450 °C had low phosphorus sorption and increased phosphorus bioavailability for acid soils and resulted in much organic carbon content [157]."
13,Biochar as an adsorbent material,"3.2 Biochar as an adsorbent material The most common application of biochar obtained from RH or, in that matter, any biomass is as an adsorbent for removal of a variety of metallic impurities and organic compounds. RH biochar is explored for adsorption of cation and anionic dyes, chromium, lithium, arsenic, and lead metals from waster water streams [57,158–161]. A recent study by Zhuang et al. explored the adsorption of volatile organic compounds such as acetone and toluene on RH biochar and showed higher adsorption capacity [162]. RH biochar is also explored for carbon dioxide adsorption [163–165]. For instance, Freire et al. prepared the geopolymers with RH to capture the CO2 and found that RH char activated with NaOH had more CO2 adsorption capacity [165]. A recent study shows that RH ash can be used to prepare a free ZSM-5 template for the adsorption of CO2 and found that the RH free ZSM-5 template had the highest CO2 adsorption capacity at 273 K and 15 bar [163]. Another study by Ahmad et al. produced RH biochar by slow pyrolysis technique and studied its adsorption properties against methylene blue dye solution in a packed bed continuous reactor (PBCR). The adsorption capacity of RH biochar (RHB) was found in the range of 71.0–99.0%. [166]. Ahmaruzzaman et al. conducted batch studies to remove phenol from wastewater using RH char as an adsorbent and found that Langmuir constant of 7.9 mg/g of phenol [40]. Similar works have been carried out to remove [40] multiple impurities using RH biochar as an adsorbent [68,167,176–183,168–175]. Apart from adsorption applications, the gasification of biochar is also explored for the production of hydrogen. Inorganic minerals act as a catalyst during the steam reforming of biochar [155,157,184–187]. RH is also used as a catalyst support material for various applications [55,188]."
14,Rice husk as an alternative cementitious material in concrete,"Rice husk ash is also widely used as an alternative cementitious material in cement concrete. RHA has been categorized as a highly reactive pozzolanic material. It contributes to enhancing the compressive strength of concrete by two mechanisms: the pozzolanic reaction and the filler effect. Fig. 8 The compressive strength of conventional cement concrete and rice husk ash blended concrete is compared in Fig. 9. Rice husk ash is used as a cement replacement material, and enhancement in strength and durability properties of concrete is evidently reported. Several researchers have investigated the influence of rice husk ash on the performance of blended cement concrete and critically compared it with control concrete. Saraswathy and Song replaced cement with RHA up to 25% and observed 10% increase in the compressive strength compared to conventional cement concrete [189]. Bui et al., Ganesan et al., and Muthadhi and Kothandaraman studied the performance of blended cement concrete with 20% RHA [189–192]. The compressive strength of blended cement concrete is 15–20% more than that of conventional cement concrete. Compressive strength was found to be increased from 36 MPa to 41.6 MPa on the addition of 15% RHA as cement replacement. The incorporation of RHA up to 10% also improved the compressive strength by more than 10% [193–197]. The enhancement is owing to the higher pozzolanic reactivity of RHA and subsequent reduction in the permeability of the concrete. The durability of the blended concrete can be evaluated with its permeability. Hence, total charges passed obtained from the rapid chloride penetration test provides an insight into the durability of blended concrete. Higher total charges imply to higher permeability of concrete. The reduction in the total charge passed with the addition of RHA in blended cement concrete is depicted in Fig. 10. It is evident from the graph that the total charge passed is decreased with the incorporation of RHA. It indicates the reduction in permeability and increases in durability of RHA blended concrete compared with control concrete [198–202]. The filler effect causes a considerable increment in the compressive strength of concrete by filling the voids without any chemical reactions only as a result of its fine size. On the other hand, pozzolanic reaction helps in hardening concrete due to the reaction between RHA and the calcium hydroxide, which is formed in the hydration of conventional cement [203]. For instance, Ajive et al. used RHA blended cement and compared its performance with ordinary Portland cement. Compressive test results, setting time of slab, and the cement slab's weight were found to be comparable to that of the concrete containing conventional cement. [204]. Sensale et al. studied compressive strength gain of RHA blended concrete. Two rice husk types were used, uncontrolled burnt residual RHA from paddy fields and RHA produced by controlled incineration. By adding RHA, the compressive strength was increased at a higher curing duration (91 days) than the control concrete. Controlled burnt RHA blended concrete exhibited higher compressive strength, and paddy field burnt RHA showed lower splitting tensile strength [205]. Besides, all RHA concrete's strength efficiency was higher than that of control concrete up to optimum levels ranging from 10% to 20% [190,206–210]. Givi et al. suggested 10% as an optimum level of replacement. However, Ganesan et al. recommended 15% replacement of cement with RGHA for better compressive strength. Chindaprasirt et al. recommended a higher replacement level (20%) for durable RHA blended concrete. Hence, from earlier research studies, it is evident that rice husk ash can be used as a viable supplementary cementitious material to attain comparable/better performance than control specimens. It helps lower the consumption of conventional cement and indirectly reduces the carbon emissions associated with traditional cement production. Fig. 11 In cement replacement, the calcination temperature is imperative as it has a significant influence on the properties of alternative cementitious materials. Calcination of RHA influence on the pozzolanic reactivity of RHA. For example, amorphous silica is converted into less reactive silica at a higher temperature because of recrystallization. Another primary concern with calcination temperature is its direct relation with loss of ignition of agro residual ashes. When RHA is used as supplementary cementitious material, LOI must be less than 10% as it is a natural pozzolan. If LOI is higher than 10%, it leads to two major effects. The primary one is a notable reduction in the pozzolanicity of RHA, and the other one is the decrease in the workability of RHA blended concrete. Fig. 9 depicts the LOI of RHA, which were calcined at different temperatures. When the calcination temperature increases, a remarkable reduction in the LOI is also witnessed. For instance, Nair et al. reported 28% of LOI for the RHA sample calcined at 500ºC. It is more than the permissible limit of LOI (10%) for use as alternative cementitious materials in concrete. However, an increase in the calcination from 500ºC to 700ºC led to a significant drop in the LOI (5%) and hence this 700ºC calcined RHA can be used as alternative cementitious materials. In a similar manner, Ramezanianpour et al. also stated that 550 ºC was not adequate, and 650ºC was recommended to attain LOI lesser than 10% for use as alternative cementitious materials. Fig. 10 illustrates the normalized compressive strength of RHA blended concrete with respect to different temperatures and the level of replacements. Nehdi et al. investigated the influence of cement replacement with RHA at two different replacement levels (7% and 12.5%). A reduction in the normalised compressive strength was observed with an increase in the replacement level due to the dilution effect. A similar observation is also reported by Bie et al. On the other hand, a increase in the normalised compressive strength was witnessed by Ramerzanianpour et al. It is imperative to note that the same replacement levels exhibited different behaviours in the earlier studies reported by Nehdi et al. This is due to the reduction in the pozzolanicity of RHA at higher calcination temperature. Therefore, the calcination temperature is imperative in the processing of RHA for use as a cementitious material. Moreover, it helps to attain adequate strength, workability and LOI within the desirable range."
15,A Sustainable framework for effective utilization and economic viability,"Fig. 12 A sustainable framework is proposed for maximum utilization of rice industry by-products and is shown in Fig. 13. Pathways show the rice industry's material flows of primary and secondary by-products and exhibit a unique relationship between the chemical, energy, and construction sectors. The framework can be classified into three stages. Stage 1 is the production of rice husk ash. Stage 2 is the thermochemical conversion of rice husk and production of value-added products, and stage 3 is the application of these value-added products. Stage 1 starts with rice production in the paddy field, followed by the rice husk separation on the rice mills. The major product, rice, is transported to the food sector. Currently, RH is partially used as cattle feed and as a fuel in boilers to generate electricity. However, this former process is not economical and emits harmful gaseous products like sulfur and nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere. RH conversion using thermochemical conversion techniques is viable and economically feasible to produce value-added chemicals such as syngas, hydrogen, and bio-oil. As depicted from the framework, three major conversion techniques used in stage 2 are combustion, pyrolysis and gasification. By-products from the combustion are RHA and bio-energy. As shown in the figure, rice husk needs to be pre-treated before pyrolysis to improve the product yields. Acid washing, torrefaction, hydrotreatment, cellulose/hemicellulose removal, and bio-oil washing. Slow or fast pyrolysis can be used for the conversion of rice husk to several by-products. Bio-oil from fast pyrolysis contains high oxygen content and low H/C ratio causing acidity, instability, and low heating value. Non-catalytic pyrolysis yields bio-oil, pyrolytic gas, biochar. Whereas catalytic pyrolysis of rice husk produces activated biochar, syngas and H2 rich gas, and upgraded bio-oil. Nickel and Ni-based bi-metallic catalysts are widely explored to produce rich streams of syngas and hydrogen. Gasification of rice husk using gasifying agents such as air, steam, and N2 produces syngas. Applications of the products formed from these thermochemical conversion processes are shown in stage 3. The energy produced from the combustion can be used in rice mills, and excess power can be used for power generation in nearby areas. Rice husk ash or biochar produced from combustion or non-catalytic pyrolysis can be used as a cement replacement material, filler in polymer composites and absorbent. In addition to the application of RHA as cement placement, RHA can be a raw material in the production of bricks, paver blocks, light-weight concrete blocks, foamed concrete blocks, and autoclaved concrete blocks. The application of rice husk ash in the cement industry helps reduce carbon dioxide emissions as a result of cement production. In addition, the biochar can be reused as a source of mineral for soils in paddy fields. Bio-oil produced from non-catalytic pyrolysis can be blended or emulsified with petrol, and diesel and this oil can be used as a fuel for transportation. As shown in the pathway, the fuel produced can be used to transport rice from the rice mill to the food sector. Furthermore, pyrolytic gas produced can be reused as carrier gasses for pyrolysis. Moreover, the activated biochar obtained from catalytic pyrolysis is used as a catalyst and heavy metal adsorbent. One of the major by-products of catalytic pyrolysis is hydrogen. Catalytic pyrolysis yields benzene, toluene and xylene. In addition to the value-added products from RH, the proper utilization of RH reduces the disposal problems, supports economic development, and increases employment opportunities in rural areas with rich agricultural resources. The existing coal-fired conversion equipment can be utilized with minor modifications to convert the RH into value-added products. For an accurate economic evaluation, Islam et al. performed the techno-economic analysis of bio-oil from RH pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor with and without zeolite catalysts [1]. The capital and production costs are considered along with by-products credits such as pyrolytic gas and solid char. Authors simulated 10, 100, 1000 kg/h of RH pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor by considering Fixed investment cost. The costs included are capital, production, and other costs such as labour, equipment maintenance, insurance, N2, catalyst, power. The authors pointed out that 10 and 100 kg/h of RH pyrolysis dominates the labour cost and operating cost over the cost of bio-oil. However, the bio-oil from the catalytic technique has a high production cost. A large-scale production unit is more economical to produce bio-oil from RH fluidization. The gasses produced from the large-scale pyrolysis plant can be utilized as a fluidizing media, which reduces the N2 gas requirement. However, the authors pointed out that bio-oil upgradation using catalysts is not an economical choice due to the high catalyst investment costs. It seems that bio-oil from the large-scale non-catalytic process of RH pyrolysis is the most promising and cost-effective option."
16,Direction for future research studies,"The study focuses on the rice husk, its thermochemical conversion, and by-products. Moreover, the current study systematically reviews value-added products formed from thermochemical conversion and their application. The following suggestions are recommended for further research studies. • Rice husk based powerplant generates low carbon rice husk ash as a by-product, often disposed as waste in dumping yards or landfills. The RHA has many potential applications, such as an alternative cementitious material in concrete, filler in polymer composites, and a rich silica source. Earlier research studies on the performance aspect of these applications are evidently reported. However, quantitative analysis on the availability of RHA and the accessibility study are limited. Studies on these aspects pave the path for the effective reuse of rice husk ash in several domains of chemical and civil engineering applications. Hence, availability and accessibility studies of rice husk and rice husk ash are recommended. • One of the value-added products from the pyrolysis of RH is bio-oil. The bio-oil can be blended with conventional fuels such as diesel, petrol and can be used as a transportation fuel. It will reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and result in lesser greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. Further research on the performance of transportation fuel with bio-oil could help to replace the current transportation fuels. • Techniques such as catalytic pyrolysis and steam reforming on rice husk result in a gas stream rich in hydrogen. Even the biochar and the bio-oil produced from pyrolysis are used for hydrogen production using the catalytic steam reforming technique. The abundance of rice husk can become a reliable source for hydrogen production, often termed the 'fuel of the future'. Studies focusing on optimizing the thermochemical conversion parameters to improve hydrogen generation need to be carried out. • The conversion of biomass such as rice husk into bioenergy and value-added products has been attracted globally due to the key benefits such as environmentally benign operations and biomass resource utilization. Moreover, research should be carried on economic benefits associated with the conversion of rice husk to different value-added products. Thereby, the biomass conversion technologies are suggested which can enhance the rural economy and employment generation while reducing the country's dependence on imported fossil fuels. • RHA blended cement has two-fold benefits due to the reduction in land pollution associated with RHA disposal and a significant reduction in the CO2 emission associated with conventional cement production. However, studies on the quantification of these environmental benefits are highly limited in the existing literature. Therefore, studies on the life cycle and environmental impact assessment of RHA blended cement concrete and critical comparison with conventional concrete are suggested for further research. • In addition to rice husk, rice straw is abundantly available in rural areas of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan states. Fast pyrolysis of rice straw gives high yields of bio-oil (up to 75%) but with high oxygen content and low H/C ratio causing acidity, instability, and low heating value. The bio-oil can be upgraded to gasoline, and diesel ranged fuels by catalytic techniques. In the presence of catalysts, the bio-oil with high oxygen content can be upgraded as a transportation fuel. The oxygenated compounds are removed by deoxygenation routes as water, CO and CO2. Hence, the studies on rice husk can be elaborated on rice straw also. • One of the major issues is the catalyst deactivation with time-on-stream during the bio-oil upgradation. The char and sulfur compounds occupy the catalyst's active sites and lead to the catalyst deactivation. The char blocks the active sites of the catalysts and results in low yields of products during the catalytic upgradation. For this reason, future work should be focused on the development of carbon and sulfur tolerant catalysts for bio-oil upgradation. • Major studies on the reuse of RHA in blended cement production have been reported in the literature. It is also essential to study the utilization of RHA in currently used other construction materials such as aerated blocks, light-weight concrete blocks, unburned bricks, etc. For that reason, studies on RHA-based construction products and their performance evaluation are suggested for future research."
17,Conclusions,"This review presented the thermochemical conversion of rice husk into value-added chemicals. The literature showed that the valorization of rice husk has a tremendous potential to produce value-added chemicals such as hydrogen, syngas, transportation fuels, and aromatics. The value-added products and their properties depend on the adopted thermochemical conversion methods and their parameters. The gasification of rice husk produces hydrogen or syngas and high yields of H2 when steam is used as the gasifying agent. The gas yield increases with the gasification temperature due to the high reaction rates. Moreover, a high yield of tar components was observed during the gasification. The tar components can be cracked into lower hydrocarbons in the presence of catalysts. Several catalysts such as Ni, Fe, Co, Zn are explored to increase the hydrogen or syngas yields. The gasification followed by catalytic reforming is carried out in a two-stage reactor. The rich hydrogen streams can be produced as a result of gasification of RH followed by catalytic steam reforming in the presence of Ni based catalysts. Pyrolysis is a thermochemical process that breaks down the rice husk into various products in the absence of oxygen in the temperature range of 300–850 °C. Pyrolysis of rice husk produces high yields of bio-oil at higher heating rates, intermediate temperatures, high gas yields at high heating rates and at high temperatures and high tar yields at low heating rates and at low temperature. Pre-treatment of rice husk with acids improves the yields of targeted products such as bio-oil, biochar, pyrolytic gas, or even a combination. The catalyst plays an essential role in upgrading vapours generated from the rice husk pyrolysis. For catalytic pyrolysis, commonly used catalysts are nickel, copper, cobalt, manganese, iron, etc., on highly porous supports like SiO2, Al2O3, and zeolites. The fast pyrolysis of rice husk is one of the sustainable processes to convert it into bio-oil. However, bio-oil quality is much lower than conventional fuels because of its thermal instability, acidic nature, and low calorific value. The bio-oil can be upgraded to transportation fuel in zeolite-based catalysts, and H-ZSM-5 is explored extensively to upgrade the pyrolytic oil. Finally, the biochar produced from the fast pyrolysis of rice husk, rich in inorganic minerals and carbon content, helps retain moisture and nutrients, decreases soil bulk density, and increases soil pH improves soil remediation. The rice husk biochar is also explored for volatile adsorption carbons and to remove the metallic compounds from wastewater streams. Rice husk ash also finds wide application in the construction sector. Rice husk ash blended cement concrete has higher compressive strength than conventional cement concrete. In addition, the incorporation of rice husk ash enhances the durability of rice hush-based concrete. Moreover, calcination temperature notably influences the performance of RHA blended cement paste. Finally, the conversion of rice husk into bioenergy and value-added products has a huge potential to attract globally due to the key benefits such as environmentally benign operations and the utilization of abundant rice husk. The products from rice husk valorization could also enhance the rural economy and employment generation while reducing the country's dependence on imported fossil fuels. Moreover, a framework for the sustainable utilization of rice husk in the chemical and cement sectors is also presented in the study."
