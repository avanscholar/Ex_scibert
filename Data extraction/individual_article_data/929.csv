0,Introduction,"Catalytic oxidation reactions triggered by the heterogeneous catalyst harvesting the light energy have been of considerable interest in the field of catalysis [1]. Introducing high selectivity into the desired product, minimization of the harsh chemicals, easy recovery of the catalyst with high recyclability are a few of the major concerns for direct applications of heterogeneous photocatalysts [2]. Photochemical reactions using heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts or nanocatalysts appeared as a new way of looking into the reactions maintaining all principles of green chemistry [3]. As such different photocatalysts in various forms have so far been developed for various organic transformations [4]. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the well-known photoactive materials that has found large applications in catalytic reactions [5]. TiO2 with band gap ranging from 3–3.2 eV however can harvest only the small fraction of UV-radiation of the solar spectrum. Therefore, much emphasis has been given to the synthesis of different other metal oxide and metal-sulfides with different compositions, sizes, and morphology and with a suitable narrower band gap that can trap the visible spectrum of solar radiations [6,7]. Iron oxides particularly goethite (α-FeOOH) and hematite (α-Fe2O3) are the most common form of metal-oxides that are ubiquitously available in the earth's crust [8]. Apart from being widely used as magnetic materials, they are also gaining much interest in catalysis, gas sensing, in solar cells, etc. [9]. From the economic point of view compared to many other transition metals, iron is much cheaper for which iron catalyst with good catalytic activity always receives special attention. Iron-oxides like α-FeOOH and α-Fe2O3 with band gap of ∼2.1 eV and ∼2.2 eV respectively is used as photocatalyst for photo-degradation of dye components and various other environmental pollutants in presence of both UV and visible source of light radiations [10]. The bared iron-oxides catalysts are advantageous in terms of their activity, cost, band gap, and applications [11]. But from the catalytic prospects, there are several disadvantages associated with iron-oxides catalysts. One of the greatest challenges in dealing with iron-oxide catalysts is to maintain the true nature of the material in the reaction medium and to have control over the reaction selectivity. Several factors like pH, temperature, agglomeration of the particles, surface defects, generation of iron sludge influenced the activity of the catalysts [12]. To overcome such limitations different inorganic supports like silica, alumina, clay, zeolites are used to make heterogeneous iron-oxide catalysts [13–15]. Pham et al. has nicely addressed the advantage of silica-supported Fe-oxide catalyst over Fenton-reagents and unsupported iron-catalyst in activation of hydrogen peroxide [16]. Halloysite nanotube (HNT) is one of such inorganic mantles or clay materials having Si and Al in their framework. The high surface area, presence of interior lumens with an inner diameter of 12–15 nm, and with good cation-exchange ability makes this material highly applicable as support for the synthesis of heterogeneous metal catalyst. Because of having such tubular shape, they can serve as suitable host for selective transportation of reactants or substrate molecules and with good mass activity [17]. They provide high stability and can be reusable without significant loss in catalytic activity. Very recently, we reported for the synthesis of HNT supported Cr2O3 CoO mixed metal oxide catalyst and their application as suitable photocatalyst for various alcohol oxidation [18]. Almasri et al. has synthesized Fe-oxide nanocatalyst over HNT for phosphate adsorption applicable in waste-water treatment [19]. Considering the benefits of the HNT and iron-oxides as cheap materials we herein tried to develop a hybrid catalyst comprising of HNT and iron-oxide for photo-oxidation of various alcohols viz benzyl alcohols (BAs) and 2-naphthol. The two reactions have been chosen as the selective oxidation of these alcohols into their respective desired products like benzaldehydes and BINOL has gained significant importance in the field of catalysis [20,21]. Moreover, the oxidized products are highly needed as starting material in large scales for the preparation of various chemically and biologically active molecules such as antioxidants, vitamins, medicinal drugs, cosmetics, chiral auxiliaries [22]."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Halloysite nanoclay (HNT) was brought from Sigma-Aldrich. Silica (SiO2), alumina powder (Al2O3), disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and ferric (III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3•6H2O) was procured from E-Merck. HPLC grade acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, toluene, and all other solvents were procured from E-Merck. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and 2-naphthol were received from E-Merck. Benzyl alcohol and its substituted derivatives were also brought from Sigma-Aldrich. Milli-Q water (H2O) was used as required."
3,modification of the interior lumen of HNT with EDTA,"2.2 modification of the interior lumen of HNT with EDTA The modification of the interior lumen of HNT was done by using EDTA following the synthetic procedure reported by Das and Jana [1,23]. In a typical process, 2 g of HNT was added into a round bottom (RB) flask containing a solution of 2.5 g of EDTA in 20 mL of water. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 8.0 by dropwise addition of 0.1 M NaOH (aq) solution. The reaction set-up was then connected to a vacuum pump and the mixture was stirred by applying a pressure of 0.3 millibar (mb) at room temperature (RT). The stirring course was managed with a time interval of 30 min after a continuous stirring for 1 h. The process was continued up to 72 h to get a high loading of EDTA inside the interior lumen of HNT. The resulting solution was filtered with Whatman No. 1 filter paper and the residual material was washed with Mili-Q water severely to remove the unreacted EDTA and dried under vacuum atmosphere at 100 °C."
4,Synthesis of Fe2O3 HNT using modified HNT,2.3 Synthesis of Fe2O3 HNT using modified HNT The Fe2O3 HNT was prepared by mixing 1 g of EDTA modified HNT with 2 mmol (0.54 g) of FeCl3•6H2O prepared in 10 mL of water in an RB. To this additional 15 mL of water was added and the whole reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 6 h. The same mixture was then stirred for another additional 8 h applying a pressure of 0.3 mb at RT by connecting the reaction vessel to a vacuum pump. The stirring under the applied pressure was not performed in a continuous manner. It was maintained by stirring for 1 h with an interval of 15 min and the process was repeated for 8 times. The resultant material was subjected to Soxhlet extraction to remove any impurity. The complete removal of chloride ion was confirmed through the silver nitrate (AgNO3) test. The material obtained after Soxhlet extraction was further calcinated at 400 °C and finally dried under vacuum to obtain the light reddish-brown coloured Fe2O3 HNT solid material. The method of synthesis is represented pictorially in Scheme 1.
5,Synthesis of Fe2O3-SiO2 and Fe2O3-Al2O3,"2.4 Synthesis of Fe2O3-SiO2 and Fe2O3-Al2O3 Iron oxide (Fe2O3) supported silica (SiO2) and alumina (Al2O3) were synthesized via solid-state grinding approach. In a minimum amount of milli-Q water, 0.5 mmol (0.135 g) of FeCl3•6H2O was dissolved and transferred to a mortar pestle containing 2 g of SiO2 and formed a paste. The paste was ground for several hours followed by the subsequent addition of ethanol into it. The material was washed with warm water (60 °C) and through Soxhlet extraction. The removal of Cl− ion was confirmed from the AgNO3 test. Finally, the obtained light reddish-brown coloured material (Fe2O3-SiO2) was dried in an oven in air at 120 °C and then dried in vacuum for 2 h. Al2O3 supported iron oxide, Fe2O3-Al2O3 was also synthesized using the same procedure."
6,Procedure for photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols,"2.5 Procedure for photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols The photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols (BA) to benzaldehydes with high selectivity in presence of the synthesized Fe2O3 HNT catalyst was carried out in a photochemical reactor comprising of a 500 mL of reaction chamber made up of quartz, surrounded by a 300 W Xenon arc lamp along with a UV cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) as the visible light source. The light source was encircled by a double-jacketed quartz immersion by means of a well with an inlet and outlet for water circulation to ensure a safe temperature throughout the photocatalytic process. At first, 25 mg of the catalyst sample was immersed into 20 mL of methanol (MeOH) along with 2 mmol of BA in the photocatalytic reaction chamber. The reaction was performed with molecular oxygen (O2) as oxidant and the O2 was passed with a flow rate of 60 mL/min in presence of light for 30 min. It was done by continual stirring by a magnetic stir placed inside the reactor. The whole photochemical reaction was completed at RT. The reaction progress was monitored through thin layer chromatography (TLC) using ethyl acetate/n-hexane, 1:9. The resultant product i.e., benzaldehyde was separated by utilizing column chromatographic analysis (100–200 mesh silica) with a mixture of n-hexane and ethyl acetate as eluent. In the same way, the oxidant O2 was replaced by 3 mmol of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the reaction was carried out by adding 2 mmol of BA into 20 mL of acetonitrile (CH3CN) followed by the addition of 25 mg of Fe2O3 HNT at RT. The photoirradiation time was set as 20 min. After 20 min the reaction was quenched, and benzaldehyde was separated by chromatographic analysis."
7,Procedure for oxidation of benzyl alcohols in dark environment,"2.6 Procedure for oxidation of benzyl alcohols in dark environment In a general process, 2 mmol of the substrate (BA) was dissolved in 20 mL of MeOH and 25 mg of Fe2O3 HNT was suspended to it and O2-gas was passed with a flow rate of 60 mL/min. The resultant mixture was stirred at RT. To maintain a dark environment the RB flask containing the reaction mixture was covered with black paper and switch all the possible light sources inside and the reaction setup. The dark phase reactions were performed at night to avoid the sunlight. In a similar manner, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (OBA) reaction was also investigated at RT by taking 2 mmol of BA in 20 mL of CH3CN in presence of 25 mg of Fe2O3 HNT followed by the addition of 3 mmol H2O2. The reaction was stirred by creating a dark environment inside the reaction setup. The progress of the reaction was analysed via chromatographic analysis."
8,Procedure for photocatalytic oxidation of 2-naphthol to BINOL,"2.7 Procedure for photocatalytic oxidation of 2-naphthol to BINOL The photo-oxidative conversion of 2-naphthol into BINOL was examined using O2 and H2O2 as an oxidant in presence of Fe2O3 HNT catalyst at RT under the same photocatalytic environment opted for the OBA reaction. Initially, 2 mmol of 2-naphthol was dissolved in 20 mL of toluene followed by the addition of 30 mg of Fe2O3 HNT. The reaction was performed with an O2 flow rate of 100 mL/min and light irradiation with the 300 W Xenon arc lamp for 120 min. The progress of the reaction was examined through TLC analysis (ethyl acetate/n-hexane, 1:19). BINOL was obtained as the desired product and was separated using the column chromatographic technique (60–120 mesh silica). Similarly, the reaction was also carried out using H2O2 as the oxidant. Using 3.5 mmol of H2O2 as the oxidant a reaction was placed by dissolving 2 mmol of 2-naphthol in 20 mL of toluene followed by the addition of 30 mg of the catalyst. The reaction was performed by irradiating with the visible light source for 60 min. The resultant BINOL was purified via chromatographic analysis. The photocatalytic oxidation reaction of 2-naphthol to BINOL was carried out at RT."
9,Procedure for oxidation of 2-naphthol to BINOL in dark environment,"2.8 Procedure for oxidation of 2-naphthol to BINOL in dark environment Oxidation of 2-naphthol to BINOL was carried out by dissolving 2 mmol of 2-naphthol in 20 mL of toluene in presence of 30 mg of the catalyst. The reaction was done with O2 at a flow rate of 100 mL/ min and the RB flask was covered with black paper. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT in a dark environment without having any light source. Similarly, the same reaction was examined by considering H2O2 as the oxidant in a dark environment. In presence of 3.5 mmol of H2O2, 2 mmol of 2-naphthol was dissolved in 20 mL of toluene followed by the addition of 30 mg Fe2O3 HNT, and the reaction was monitored through chromatographic analysis. The % conversion and % selectivity of the reactions were calculated from GC-analysis. The GC-analysis was performed using the standard protocol as we followed in our previous work hence the same is not provided herein [24]. The quantitative analysis of the products was done by the following equation: % conversion = [moles of reactant×100/Initial moles of reactant] and % selectivity = [moles of product formed×100/moles of reactant reacted] in all the reactions."
10,Results and discussions,
11,Characterization of Fe2O3 HNT catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of Fe2O3 HNT catalyst The synthesized Fe2O3 HNT material was characterized and analysed via various physicochemical and spectroscopic tools. The XRD peaks obtained for Fe2O3 HNT were found to be analogous to the same obtained for pristine HNT suggesting that the structural integrity of the HNT was well retained after modification with Fe-oxide. The XRD peaks were observed at 2θ value in degree at 11.6(100), 19.9(001), 24.7(002), 34.9(110), 54.7(210), 62.3(300) for HNT, Fig. 1 a [19]. However, there occurred some alternation in the peak intensities with some minor shifting of the peaks. In the XRD pattern, there was a slight shifting of the peaks at 2θ values in degree from 11.6, 24.7, 54.7 in pure HNT to 12.1, 24.6, 54.6 of Fe2O3 HNT, respectively (Fig.1a). A significant shift of the peak at 2θ value of 11.6° to 12.1° with peak alternation provided information about the location of the Fe-oxide particles mostly in the (100) plane of HNT, (Fig. 1b) [19]. This indicated that probably the Fe-oxide particles of smaller dimensions diffused into the interior lumen of the HNT. The crystallite size of Fe2O3 HNT calculated by the Scherrer equation was different from neat HNT [25]. It was calculated to be 10.98 nm for Fe2O3 HNT and 8.12 nm for HNT. The increase in crystallite size might result from the expansion of Al-OH or Si-OH bonds due to the encapsulation of Fe2O3 particles or due to Ostwald ripening [26]. In the FTIR spectrum of neat HNT three bands at 3696, 3622, 1639, and 910 cm−1 were respectively, the characteristic band for νs(OH) surface hydroxyl groups, νs(OH), ν(OH) deformation, and δ (OH) bending of the inner hydroxyl groups (Fig. S1). The sharp band at ∼ 1028 cm−1 was for νs(Si-O) in neat HNT and was found to be weaker and flattened in the FTIR spectrum of Fe2O3 HNT due to the incorporation of Fe ions. Apart from this, no significant change was observed in the FTIR spectra indicating that the original structure moiety of HNT was well retained even after metal oxide encapsulation. The presence of Fe-oxide nanoparticles (Fe2O3 NPs) in HNT was also evident from Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) analysis. The HRTEM image of pristine HNT and the synthesized Fe2O3 HNT are shown in Fig. 2 a–f. The TEM images of pristine HNT shown in Fig. S2 demonstrated some nanosized tubular structures with hollow cavities and open ends. The presence of Fe2O3 NP within the range of 3–10 nm size in the inner boundary surface of HNT, Fig. 2b–f. The Fe2O3 NPs were found to have elongated shapes. A similar type of nanostructures was also reported by Vinokurov et al. while supporting Ru-NP inside HNT [27]. The d-spacing value of 0.31 nm corresponds to the (111) plane of HNT and that of 0.25 nm was for the (110) plane of α-phase of Fe2O3, Fig. 2f [28,29]. Fe2O3 particles were not observed on the external surface of the HNT. The presence of iron (Fe) within the material was also confirmed by energy dispersive X-Ray (EDX) elemental and mapping analysis (Fig. 3 ). From EDX analysis, the Si to Al ratio was found to be approximately equal to one (Si:Al ≅1) characteristic of HNT. This further also implied that no isomorphic substitution or desilication or dealumination occurred during the synthesis process. The weight percentage (wt%) of Fe was found to be 1.63 implying a low loading of Fe-content in the HNT. As the amount of Fe-loading was low and the sizes of the Fe2O3 NPs were < 10 nm, so no characteristics peak for Fe2O3 was observed in the XRD pattern, Fig. 1. The Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopic (FE-SEM) images of Fe2O3 HNT are shown in Fig. S3. From the FE-SEM images, it was evident that the morphology of the HNT was not affected on loading with Fe2O3 NPs. The deconvoluted XPS spectrum for Fe (2p) is shown in Fig. 4 a and the XPS peaks were fitted with respect to the C (1 s) peak with binding energy (B.E.) value of 284.8 eV (Fig. S4a). The XPS spectrum of Fe (2p) showed two prominent peaks as Fe (2p3/2) and Fe (2p1/2) BE values of 711.9 eV and 725.0 eV, respectively. The significant spin-orbit splitting between the two peaks was found to be 13.1 eV and was in accordance with the reported results for Fe (III) oxide [30]. The presence of multiple components for the Fe (2p3/2) region was characteristics of Fe (III) species in the Fe2O3 state. The observed multiplets in the Fe2O3 HNT correspond to Fe (III) species in a slightly different environment in HNT support. As the HNTs have tubular structure with the presence of lumen so the coordination environment of all the Fe (III) species in the HNT may not be the same hence resulted in the appearance of multiple signals with minimal difference in BE value. Grosvenor et al. also observed similar multiple signals in this region characteristics of Fe2O3 [31]. Further, the presence of satellite peak at 718.9 eV with a peak separation of more than 7 eV from the Fe (2p3/2) level suggested the presence of Fe (III) species. Biesinger et al. also reported that for Fe (III) species the peak separation between the satellite peak and the Fe (2p3/2) is approximately equivalent to 8 eV, while for Fe (II) species it is equivalent to 6 eV [31]. Since in our case the peak separation is 7.1 eV, so most of the Fe species were in the +3-oxidation state. The XPS analysis for other elements viz, Al, Si, and O are provided in Supporting Information (SI) (Fig. S4b-d). UV–Vis diffused reflectance spectra (DRS) of neat HNT and Fe2O3 HNT are shown in Fig. 4b. The neat HNT showed only a small peak at 254 nm (Fig. 4b, red curve), while the DRS spectrum of synthesized Fe2O3 HNT material exhibited several peaks at 233, 272, 303, 343, 373, and 475 nm (Fig. 4b, blue curve). Torrent and Baroon made an extensive study on the DRS spectrum of iron oxides [32]. They proposed that iron-oxides can absorb at UV–Vis to near IR radiations and can have several electronic transitions within the 3d5 electronic configuration. Three different types of transitions can originate from Fe3+ oxides. They are mostly the ligand field transitions, transitions from the Fe3+ cations in adjacent sites that are magnetically coupled, and the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) [31]. They found the LMCT transitions to appear in the higher energy region in the near UV-range and the ligand field transitions in the visible to near IR range i.e., from 380 to 1050 nm. Therefore, the peaks in the range of 200–303 nm, were assigned to the charge transfer transition for Fe3+←O [32]. Based on the explanation from Sherman and Waite, based on ligand field theory the three less intense and broad signals transition at 343, 373, and 475 were assigned to ligand field transitions (or D-d) corresponding to 6A1 (6S) → 4T1 (4 G), 6A1(6S) → 4T2 (4 G), and 6A1 (6S) → 4E;4A1 (4 G) [33]. The peak values in the wavelength range of 373–475 nm were characteristics of D-d transitions in Fe2O3 and were in accordance with those reported by Tandon and Gupta [34]. These transitions arise from the ground state 6A1 (6S) although both spin and parity are forbidden but becomes allowed due to magnetic coupling of electronic spins with the neighboring Fe3+ sites. From the Tauc plot, the band gap (Eg) of the material was found to be 2.14 eV analogous to the band gap reported for hematite, α-Fe2O3 (Fig. 4c) [35]. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of raw HNT and the iron oxide encapsulated HNT material (Fe2O3 HNT) are depicted in Fig.4d (I, II). Both the materials exhibited Type-I isotherm and the surface area of Fe2O3 HNT was found to be 64.807 m2/g which is almost equal to that of the neat HNT (63.4 m2/g). This implied that only the interior lumen of HNT was responsible for entrapping the major portion of Fe2O3 moieties. From the thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), the thermal stability of the synthesized Fe2O3 HNT material was found to be almost similar to that of the pristine HNT while a negligible% weight loss was observed at a higher temperature range due to the incorporation of iron oxide into HNT (Fig. S5). The material was also characterized through photoluminescence (PL) as well as photocurrent analysis. The PL spectra of Fe2O3 HNT displayed a band at 446 nm with a reasonable intensity, characteristics of Fe2O3, Fig. 5 a [36]. The intensity from the PL spectra suggested the lower rate of recombination of electrons and holes during the photocatalytic experiments. From Fig. 5b, it can be said that Fe2O3 HNT showed remarkable and renewable photocurrent response after 4 cycles of xenon lamp on and off. The material exhibited a high photocurrent density of about 23.37 μA cm−2 implying a high separation efficiency between the photogenerated carriers."
12,Catalytic study,"3.2 Catalytic study 3.2.1 Selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols Selective formation of benzaldehydes from oxidation of BAs is one of the well-investigated organic transformation reactions [37,38]. Generally, oxidation of BA with permanganate, H2O2 leads to the formation of benzaldehyde as the major oxidized product along with various other side products like benzoic acid, dibenzyl ether, benzyl benzoate, etc. [39]. This has compelled the researchers to think of certain alternative approaches that can provide high selectivity in the reaction. Recently, various research groups reported several metal or metal oxide catalysts with reasonable to good selectivity for BA oxidation [40,41]. Most of these catalysts involve some costly metals like Au, Pd, Pt, etc. [40–44]. From our own group, we reported for Pd-Cu and Co-Cr based heterogeneous catalyst for effective catalytic oxidation of BA with high selectivity [45,18]. Thus, it is reasonably worthy to have a low-cost transition metal catalyst with a high percentage of selectivity as well as a good conversion that can easily compete with noble metal catalysts. Apart from this, one major point of any heterogeneous catalytic transformation is recyclability [46]. A catalyst with a good recyclability along with high selectivity towards organic transformations can be considered as a useful and beneficial catalyst. Simultaneously, developing a process for control oxidation reaction under light energy provides a way towards sustainable development [47]. In recent literature reports, it is evident that various metal or metal oxide NPs supported on several organic or inorganic support are excellent photoactive catalytic systems for oxidation of BAs to benzaldehydes [48]. We have found a good absorption band for the synthesized Fe2O3 HNT catalyst in the visible range along with a suitable band gap of ∼2.14 eV. So, considering the importance of this reaction, the synthesized catalyst was explored for BA oxidation reaction. 3.2.2 Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols with molecular oxygen (O2) Initially, the reaction was performed by taking 2 mmol of BA, 20 mL of CH3CN as the solvent in presence of 5 mg of Fe2O3 HNT as the catalyst, and molecular oxygen (O2) as the oxidant. The partial pressure of O2 was maintained with a flow rate of 10 mL/min at RT. The reaction mixture was performed in a photochemical reaction chamber with visible light irradiation from a 300 W xenon arc lamp source for 10 min. After 10 min, the reaction was quenched, and the catalyst was separated through filtration. From GC-analysis, the % conversion and % selectivity were found to be 27% and 70%, respectively. As the results were not satisfactory, the same reaction was performed under identical conditions in different solvents viz dichloromethane (DCM), toluene (PhMe), methanol (CH3OH), ethanol (EtOH), and H2O. The % conversion and % selectivity obtained using different solvents are depicted graphically in Fig. 6 a. MeOH was found to be the appropriate solvent for this photocatalytic transformation with 46% conversion and 100% selectivity. Recently, various other researchers also found MeOH as the suitable solvent for the catalytic oxidation reaction of BAs [49]. Further, O2 gets dissolved more in the case of protic solvents and this might be the probable reason for obtaining a good % conversion of BA as well as % selectivity of benzaldehyde in protic solvents. Moeini et al. also observed good conversion of BA to benzaldehydes in protic solvents like CH3OH, EtOH, etc. [50]. However, the % conversion of BA was found to be less in the case of H2O due to the low solubility of BA in H2O. The partial pressure of O2 also plays a vital role in modulating the catalytic performance [51]. Therefore, the reaction was carried out by varying the rate of flow of O2 from 10 to 80 mL/min and examined the reaction progress. Remarkably, it was observed that the photocatalytic oxidation rate of BA was satisfactorily enhanced up to 72% conversion with 100% selectivity when the rate of O2 flow was 60 mL/ min. The reaction progress became saturated on further increment of the O2 flow with decreasing of % selectivity. Therefore, the rate of O2 flow significantly influenced in the % conversion, as well as % selectivity of benzaldehyde and the results are presented graphically in Fig. 6b. Apart from the other factors, the time of irradiation also has a significant impact on the % of selectivity and conversion in a photocatalytic reaction [52]. To optimize the time of visible-light irradiation, the reaction was performed by varying the photoirradiation time from 10 to 50 min. The reaction was performed in MeOH with 5 mg of catalyst and with an O2 flow rate of 60 mL/min. It was observed that going from 10 to 30 min of the photoirradiation time, the% conversion remarkably increased up to 87% with constant % selectivity. The % selectivity was found to decrease on increasing the reaction time causing the overoxidation of benzaldehydes. Hence, 30 min was taken as the optimum irradiation time for the photocatalytic oxidation of BA (Fig. 6c). After finding suitable solvent condition, O2 flow rate, and the photoirradiation time, the effect of catalyst amount was investigated by varying the amount of Fe2O3 HNT from 5 mg to 30 mg keeping all other parameters fixed. It was observed that on using 25 mg of the catalyst there is a considerable increase in the % conversion from 87 to 93 with 100% selectivity. No visible change was observed in increasing the catalyst amount. This suggested that 25 mg was the effective amount of the catalyst for successive selective oxidation of BA (Fig. 6d). The oxidation of BA was done under the optimized conditions in absence of light source creating a dark environment inside the reaction chamber. No trace amount of the oxidized product was detected in the dark atmosphere confirming that the light was essential for the selective oxidation of BA. After optimizing the reaction, various other aromatic BA were tested under the optimized reaction conditions. The respective benzaldehydes were separable via column chromatography and so the isolated % yields are reported herein (Table 1 ). 3.2.3 Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) Hydrogen peroxide (30% w/v) is considered as one of the green oxidants [53]. There are several reports on the oxidation of BA using this oxidant with different catalysts [12]. However, the chain propagation reaction initiated by the hydroxy radical (HO•) hampers the selectivity [54]. Therefore, several researchers have adopted different strategies to mitigate such problems and to improve the selectivity in presence of H2O2 [55]. Catalyst that can promote such oxidation reaction without going through the free radical mechanism is believed to be more advantageous in terms of selectivity [12]. Compared to H2O2 molecular O2 is better in terms of product selectivity [56]. But oxidizing ability of H2O2 is better than O2 and takes less time for complete conversion although selectivity remains as a major issue. As our catalyst is a heterogeneous one with certain advantages as mentioned above so the photo-oxidation of BA was again studied using H2O2 as the oxidant. Taking the previously optimized solvent (MeOH), time of irradiation (30 min), catalyst (25 mg), and temperature (RT) conditions the BA oxidation was performed taking 2 mmol of H2O2 as the oxidant. However, the results were found to be unsatisfactory under the catalytic conditions. The conversion was found to be 52% with 87% selectivity. This gave us a realization that probably the activity of the catalyst in presence of H2O2 did not follow the same trend as with molecular oxygen. To see the further improvement in the reaction various other reaction conditions were varied as in the previous cases. Investigation of the influence of various parameters suggested that the reaction goes well in CH3CN with 74% conversion and 97% selectivity (Fig. S6a). Recently, our own group also found CH3CN as the appropriate solvent for the photocatalytic oxidation of BAs with good conversion and selectivity [18]. It was also reported that CH3CN being a polar solvent with a high dielectric constant can dissolve the oxidant like TBHP along with the BA. This in turn can direct the incoming BA molecule so that it gets properly adsorbed on the catalyst surface and thereby brings good conversion and selectivity in the reaction [57]. Highly polar solvents like acetonitrile may also facilitate formation of active oxygen species and thereby enhance the catalytic activity. The catalytic activity was further improved with increasing amount of H2O2 up to 3 mmol. On introduction of 3 mmol of H2O2, the % conversion was found to increase from 74 to 83 with 97% selectivity (Fig. S6b). Further increase in the H2O2 amount from 3 to 4 mmol led to the loss in % selectivity. The reaction was then performed by varying the time of irradiation from 10 to 50 min. It was observed that 20 min of photo-irradiation time was enough to give 83% conversion with 97% selectivity. Therefore, 20 min was the optimal photoirradiation time for the selective production of benzaldehyde from BA in presence of Fe2O3 HNT catalyst (Fig. S6c). Subsequently, we varied the amount of catalyst and fortunately, 25 mg of Fe2O3 HNT catalyst was found to be the operative amount for the effective conversion of BA to the desired product (Fig. S6d). The high selectivity of the reaction can be explained by the fact that the HNT support restricts the over oxidation of the benzaldehyde by trapping the excess free radical that can propagate the chain reaction. There have been several studies based on ESR experiment that such an aluminosilicate framework can trap the HO• radical and can do the selective oxidation of organic substrate. It was also proposed that the excess electrons can be captured by the radiation-induced defects in such an aluminosilicate framework, and was well studied using ESR spectroscopy [58,59]. H2O2 decomposition was monitored in the presence and absence of light. From the kinetic study, it was found that in presence of Fe2O3 HNT catalyst H2O2 decomposition followed first-order kinetics irrespective of light irradiation. The details of the kinetics experiment are provided in SI, Fig. S7. Lin and Gurol also found decomposition of H2O2 to follow first-order kinetics in presence of iron (III) oxide [60]. It was also reported that illuminating with light has no effect on the H2O2 decomposition rate. As the H2O2 decomposition rate was independent of light, so the reaction was also investigated in absence of light by creating a dark environment inside the reaction setup and putting rest of the condition same. Unfortunately, within the optimum amount of time (20 min), the reaction was not successful in the dark environment as only 5% conversion was observed. But, increasing the reaction time up to 1 h, the conversion of benzyl alcohol improved to 22%. This indicated that BA oxidation was not solely dependent on the rate of H2O2 decomposition. Previous reports suggested that BA oxidation is more dependent on the activation barrier of the benzylic CH bond activation on the metal oxide surface [61]. Probably in absence of light the activation barrier was high for which formation of benzaldehyde did not happen within 20 min in absence of light. This indicated that H2O2 decomposition was not only the factor for BA oxidation under the present experimental condition. The light induction was essential for selective conversion of BA to benzaldehyde over the Fe2O3 HNT surface within a short period. After getting the optimized condition, various derivatives of BA are tested, and respective benzaldehyde derivatives were obtained. The % conversion and % selectivity along with the isolated % yields of the respective products with different oxidant conditions were depicted in Table 1. In order to understand the role of HNT in bringing the selective oxidation reaction, the BA oxidation reaction using H2O2 as oxidant under the optimum condition (2 mmol BA, 25 mg of Fe2O3 HNT catalyst, 20 mL of CH3CN, 3 mmol H2O2 under photo-irradiation using 300 W xenon arc lamp at RT for 20 min) was further performed by two other iron catalysts synthesized by the same protocol using silica (SiO2) and alumina (Al2O3) as support. Both the synthesized materials, Fe2O3-SiO2, and Fe2O3-Al2O3 were characterized by XRD, UV–Vis DRS, FE-SEM, and EDX analysis. The details of their characterizations and analysis are provided in SI (Figs. S8-S12). The results of the photocatalytic oxidation reaction of BA using H2O2 as oxidant and these two catalysts (Fe2O3-SiO2, Fe2O3-Al2O3) were compared with Fe2O3 HNT and are shown in Table S1. From the analysis, it was found that in all cases the% conversion was similar. However, the selectivity of the reaction in the case of iron oxide loaded in SiO2 and Al2O3 was poor in comparison to Fe2O3 HNT. This suggested that the HNT material having cylindrical shape with lumen diameter of 12–15 nm provided a good selectivity in the reaction. As the porous materials with such structural morphology provide selectivity towards the transition state as well as to the product, so the reaction happened with good selectivity on using HNT as the support for iron oxide catalyst. Moreover, the confinement effect imposed by the support on the metal catalyst also changes the electronic as well as the redox activity of the catalyst [18]. As in the present case, most of the iron oxide materials are located at the interior surface of HNT, so probably their activity was altered due to such confinement effect and thereby resulted in a good catalytic activity in the reaction in comparison to those supports having no such effect. Apart from this, a significant change was also observed in the intensity of DRS-UV–vis signals between Fe2O3 HNT and Fe2O3-SiO2, Fe2O3-Al2O3. The intensity of UV–vis bands of Fe2O3 HNT (Fig. 4b) was much higher than those of Fe2O3-Al2O3 and Fe2O3-SiO2 (Fig. S8b). The change was attributed due to the difference in optical basicity of HNT with SiO2 and Al2O3. The optical basicity is mostly expressed as the average negative charge borne by the oxygen atoms and is defined as unity for the condition of “ionic” oxygen (in the oxidation state of −2), [62]. Now as the outer surface of HNT is negatively charged, so it is expected that the optical basicity of Fe2O3 HNT will be higher than those of Fe2O3-Al2O3 and Fe2O3-SiO2 leading to the distinguishable change in the intensity of the DRS-UV–vis signals. Similar reports are also available that accounts for the remarkable increase in the intensity of UV–vis absorption bands caused by the increase in optical basicity [63]. This change in optical basicity between the three catalysts might have also influenced the photocatalytic activity. 3.2.4 Photocatalytic oxidation of 2-naphthol to BINOL The selective formation of BINOL from 2-naphthol is one of the well-studied organic transformation reactions [64]. Different literature reports suggested that various metal catalysts like metal oxide nanocatalysts, metal salts, metal Schiff-base complexes, metal NPs supported on various inorganic mantles can be effective for such oxidative CC coupling reactions [65,66]. Out of the various transition metal catalysts, Fe-based catalysts are known to be most effective for such conversion [67]. Maximum reported results account for the use of O2 as oxidant but only a countable number of reports are available on the selective oxidation of 2-naphthol in presence of H2O2 [24]. Oxidation of 2-naphthol with H2O2 leads to the formation of by-products such as 1,2-naphthoquinone and 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene with a very poor yield of BINOL [60]. In presence of O2, the observed reaction time is quite longer as it is a mild oxidant. Therefore, it is equally imperative to choose a suitable catalyst that can result in selective formation of BINOL from 2-naphthol with significant% conversion in a limited period. The oxidant H2O2 (30% w/v) is effective due to its capability to convert the major portion of the reactant within a short period of time. But the selectivity remains uncontrollable with the involvement of this oxidant. To address such problem oxidative coupling reaction of 2-naphthol was investigated by applying the synthesized Fe2O3 HNT catalyst under visible-light irradiation in presence of both O2 and H2O2 as the oxidant. 3.2.5 Photocatalytic oxidation of 2-naphthol to BINOL with molecular oxygen (O2) Initially, the reaction was performed with the optimized parameters obtained for photocatalytic BA oxidation for both the oxidants. Under this condition, BINOL was obtained with very unsatisfactory yield. From our own investigation and various other literature reports suggest toluene as a suitable solvent for such oxidative coupling reaction [24,68]. Accordingly, the reaction was carried out by using toluene as the solvent under the photocatalytic conditions with O2 and H2O2 separately. At first, we dissolved 2 mmol of 2-naphthol in 20 mL of toluene in presence of 25 mg of Fe2O3 HNT catalyst, and the whole reaction mixture was saturated with O2 at the flow rate of 60 mL/ min. Consequently, the photoirradiation time was set for 30 min and after this interval, it was observed that BINOL was selectively obtained with 32% yield. As we know that there was a major influence of the photoirradiation time in the reaction progress, so varying the photoirradiation time-lapse from 30 to 120 min an increase% yield of BINOL was observed up to 64% and after 120 min the formation of BINOL got saturated. Therefore, 120 min of photoirradiation was considered as the optimum time for this transformation (Fig. S13a). The time interval in this oxidative coupling reaction was found to be effectively low in comparison with various other non-photocatalytic conditions [69]. Like the BA oxidation reaction, we varied the rate of flow of O2 partial pressure to get a better% yield. It was noticed that maximum 87% yield of BINOL was formed when the O2 flow rate was 100 mL/ min under this applied condition (Fig. S13b). Declination in the % selectivity of BINOL was observed when O2 flow rate was increased beyond 100 mL/ min (Fig. S13c). After getting the optimum time interval as well as the ideal rate of O2 partial pressure, amount of the catalyst was varied. Initially, the reaction proceeded in presence of 25 mg of the synthesized catalyst with the same condition cited above. By varying the amount of the catalyst from 5 to 30 mg there was an increase in the% yield up to 89% and after increasing the same BINOL formation got saturated. Hence, 30 mg of Fe2O3 HNT was considered to be the effective amount of the catalyst for this photocatalytic transformation (Fig. S13d). 3.2.6 Photocatalytic oxidation of 2-naphthol to BINOL with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) Like the photocatalytic oxidation of BA, we also tested the reaction of oxidative coupling of 2-naphthol with H2O2 applying the same above reaction condition. In presence of 3 mmol of H2O2, BINOL was obtained with by-products when the photoirradiation time was 120 min and catalyst amount was 30 mg. Therefore, we again optimized the different parameters to get a reasonable% yield with an acceptable selectivity. At first, by investigating the reaction progress with different time intervals, the effective photoirradiation time was found to be 60 min that resulted in 67% of BINOL without forming any other by-products (Fig. S14a). Therefore, 60 min was considered to be the effective photoirradiation time for this reaction when the reaction was set by dissolving 2 mmol of 2-naphthol in 20 mL of toluene in presence of 30 mg of the catalyst and 3 mmol of H2O2 at RT. Accordingly, we varied the amount of H2O2 keeping the other parameters constant. It was observed that on increasing H2O2 amount from 0.5 mmol to 3.5 mmol, BINOL was selectively formed with a maximum of 72% yield, and exceeding this amount resulted in the dramatic decrease of the product selectivity (Fig. S14b, c). So, 3.5 mmol was considered as the standard amount of H2O2 in presence of Fe2O3 HNT catalyst. We varied the amount of Fe2O3 HNT catalyst applied for the reaction and it was noticed that 30 mg was the effective amount of the catalyst which resulted in 72% of BINOL as% yield (Fig. S14d). An experiment with the same conditions in absence of light was driven but no trace amount of BINOL formation was observed in the dark environment. Although, only 1,2-naphthoquinone was obtained from 2-naphthol under the light-driven condition with H2O2 as oxidant without Fe2O3 HNT catalyst. The reaction did not proceed at all in presence of light and O2 confirming the role of the catalyst. In absence of light, the BINOL formation was not observed upto 48 h in presence of O2 (100 mL/ min) and the Fe2O3 HNT catalyst (25 mg). This concludes that selective BINOL formation form 2-naphthol proceeded more effectively under photocatalytic condition. The photocatalytic synthesis of BINOL via our investigated protocol is depicted in Table 2 . To the best of our knowledge, the oxidation of 2-naphthol selectively to BINOL with such a good yield in presence of H2O2 is limited in literature [60]. A few of the recent literature involving the investigation of the selective oxidative coupling reaction of 2-naphthol to BINOL in presence of Fe-based catalysts were represented in Table S2 for comparison. 3.2.7 Comparative analysis of % conversion and % selectivity with O2 and H2O2 In order to get a comparative result for% conversion as well as% selectivity of the desired product in presence of both the oxidants, we considered the photocatalytic oxidation reaction of BA operated at RT. As from our above analysis, it was perceived that EtOH served as one of the suitable solvents both for O2 and H2O2 environments. Accordingly, the reactions were performed in EtOH in presence of 25 mg of Fe2O3 HNT catalyst by saturating the reaction mixture with O2 with a flow rate of 60 mL/ min in one case and adding 3 mmol of H2O2 in the other case. Therefore, to study the selectivity variation, we altered the photo-irradiation time for both the event, and the respective results were depicted graphically in Fig. S15. From the plot, it was evident that the% selectivity of benzaldehyde was relatively acceptable in O2 atmosphere than H2O2 with a maximum of 99% selectivity when the photoirradiation time was between 25 and 30 min. The maximum% conversion was found to be 81% with 60 mL/ min of O2 flow in 30 min. After 30 min,% selectivity gradually decreased up to 94% with constant% conversion. Besides, in the case of 3 mmol H2O2, maximum of 99% selectivity was noticed with 66% of conversion as soon as the time of photoirradiation was 20 min. Although, the% conversion increased progressively upto 69% a notable decrease in% selectivity upto 88% was observed when the reaction time was increased upto 40 min. Hence, from both% conversion and% selectivity investigation, we can say that O2 is the better option as an oxidant for effective formation of benzaldehyde from BA with satisfactory% selectivity in presence of Fe2O3 HNT catalyst. 3.2.8 Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis The oxidation of BA with Fe2O3 HNT catalyst was expected to proceed through superoxide radical formation under visible light irradiation. Since, the catalyst has a suitable band gap of ∼2.14 eV, so it can absorb the visible light radiation. Once the light radiation falls on the catalyst, there will be a transition from the valance band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) producing holes (h +) and electrons (e −). The negatively charged e − will combine with molecular O2 to produce superoxide radicals. Due to their high reactivity, these superoxide radicals may directly react with the substrate molecule and can do the oxidation reaction. So, the reaction might have proceeded through a superoxide radical mechanism. The same reactive species can also be bound to the Fe2O3 HNT catalyst and can get stabilized. To understand the formation of superoxide radicals, electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopic analysis was performed on the catalyst before and after treating with molecular O2 and after light irradiation. The ESR spectrum of Fe2O3 HNT showed a broad signal with g = 4.37 at 184.7 mT and a weak shoulder peak at g∼4.7, characteristics of high spin Fe (III) species (Fig. 7 a, curve I). The peak at g∼4.3 was characteristic of both tetra or octahedrally coordinated Fe(III) or may be due to the rhombic distortion of those tetra or octahedrally occupied Fe(III) species [70]. The g∼2.00 resonance was attributed to the octahedrally coordinated Fe (III) or cluster of Fe(III) ions resulted from strong spin-spin interactions with the neighboring sites [71]. The same material when treated with molecular oxygen, 16O2 at a flow rate of 30 mL/min under visible light irradiation for 10 min produced a different ESR spectrum with a sharp signal along with the three g-component (gyy =2.004, gyy = 2.006 and gzz = 2.019) characteristics of superoxide radical O2 −• bound on metal oxide surface, (Fig. 7a, curve II). Hyperfine lines were observed in the ESR spectra recorded after irradiating the sample for 30 min with an O2 flow rate of 50 mL/min (Fig. 7a, curve III). Three different g-tensor components were expected as the single g-factor can only be obtained for a single electron in an isotropic environment or when the electron is in a perfectly cubic system or plummeting rapidly in solution. But in the case of powder sample, there can be random orientation with respect to the magnetic field. The characteristics features in the ESR spectra for powder samples will appear when δB/δθ = 0 and δB/δϕ = 0, where B is the resonant magnetic field and θ and ϕ are angles of polar coordinates depicting the orientation of principal g tensor axes with respect to external magnetic field B. For linear molecules like O2 or superoxide radical with lower molecular symmetry, the g-factor was thus influenced by its orientation with respect to the magnetic field leading to three characteristics g-values and can arise for θ =0, (Bz), θ=π/2 and ϕ=0, (Bx) and θ=ϕ=π/2, (By) corresponding to gxx, gyy and gzz components of g-tensors for 16O2 .− species [72]. The ESR spectrum recorded after irradiation for 30 min and with an O2 flow rate of 50 mL/min showed hyperfine structure caused by the splitting of these three lines due to interaction with the high spin Fe(III) nuclei with I = 1/2 and S = 5/2 of Fe2O3 HNT. On further treatment for 120 min, the ESR signal at g∼4.3 was found to be lost with the change in the hyperfine structure in the higher magnetic field region (Fig. 7a, curve IV). The disappearance of the signal at g = 4.3 signified the decrease in the concentration of high spin Fe(III) species with its subsequent oxidation to Fe(IV) species that are ESR silent in the X-band region. Many other researchers also proposed for such electron transfer process on the heterogeneous surfaces from metal to O2 forming high valent metal center and superoxide radical species [73,74]. The hyperfine lines were observed in the ESR spectra of Fe2O3 HNT when the sample was saturated with O2 followed by irradiating with visible light for 30 min (red curve) and 120 min (black curve), Fig. 7b. Thus from the ESR analysis, it was concluded that superoxide radical was generated on the solid surface of Fe2O3 HNT catalyst upon light irradiation which then interacted with high spin Fe(III) nuclei producing the hyperfine lines in the ESR spectrum. It has been reported in the literature that aluminosilicates like zeolite can stabilize such radicals for a longer period [75,76]. Therefore, it was expected that the radical was stabilized over the heterogeneous metal-oxide surface. Very recently Xu et al. also reported the significant enhancement in superoxide radical generation over Cu/Fe loaded zeolite for degradation of bisphenols [77]. Thus, from the ESR analysis, it was confirmed that the superoxide radical was generated on reacting with molecular O2 with the Fe2O3 HNT catalyst and was quite stable. To evident the superoxide binding, DFT calculations, Raman spectroscopic analysis as well as in situ-FTIR analysis were performed and the details of the results are depicted in SI, Table S3, Figs. S16-S17. 3.2.9 Plausible mechanism for selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols Based on the above experimental and theoretical findings, two plausible mechanisms are depicted as shown in Scheme 2 . The first mechanism is proposed based on literature evidence which suggests that in presence of light there will be an electron transfer (e −) from the valence band of Fe2O3 to its conduction band (Scheme 2a) [78]. The ejected electrons will react with O2 to produce the O2 •− radical. The generated radicals in the solution can be bound to the catalyst surface or can combine with one H + ion from solvent to form HOO• species. The hydroxy‑peroxy radical will then form H2O2 and will decompose to generate reactive hydroxyl radical HO• radical and will consequently react with BA to form benzaldehyde through the usual free radical mechanism [79]. In another approach, the radical species may be bound to Fe-center and will react to surface adsorbed BA to produce the benzaldehyde as shown in Scheme 2b. In the mechanism shown in Scheme 2b, the reaction proceeds with the initial formation of Fe(III) superoxide intermediate which immediately gets converted to a Fe(III) peroxide intermediate by receiving a second electron generated during the photo-excitation process. A similar reaction intermediate (Fe-O-O) was also detected by Hülsey et al. through mass spectrometry in BA oxidation [80]. The Fe(III) peroxide species easily gets protonated to form a low spin FeIII-OOH species by receiving a proton from the solvent. Once the BA comes into play, the OO bond undergoes a homolytic cleavage to form a high valent oxo-π cation species which finally abstracts a proton from BA to from a FeIV-OH intermediate compound. At this point, there also occurred the heterolytic cleavage of OH and benzylic CH bond favoring the benzaldehyde formation. The FeIV-OH takes another proton from the solvent and returns to its original state with the release of a water molecule [81]. To investigate the mechanism, an UV–Vis spectroscopic measurement was performed under the standard reactions condition (Fig. S18). The black curve having an absorption of 0.65 at ∼ 228 nm represents the absorption spectrum BA before the addition of the catalyst and without any supply of O2. Then the UV–Vis spectrum was recorded after a certain interval. Upto 10 min, no peak corresponding to benzaldehyde was observed. But UV–vis spectrum showed a decrease in the concentration of the BA. The decrease in BA absorption value suggested the initial adsorption of the substrate molecule on the catalyst surface. The reaction started after 15 min of reactions as observed from the notable change in absorption spectrum. Thus, from the above UV–Vis spectroscopic analysis it was assumed that the reaction proceeded through initial adsorption of the surface molecule on the catalyst surface and hence probably the reaction proceeded as per the pathway shown in Scheme 2b. The adsorption ability of the bare Fe(III) complex with BA and 2-naphthol was also investigated. The optimized geometries of the surface bound BA and 2-naphthol with the model Fe-system are shown in Fig. S19. The calculated ΔG298 of the adduct formation with BA was found to be −6.7 kcal/mol while that for 2-naphthol was calculated as −8.3 kcal/mol, suggesting favorable thermodynamics of their adsorption to the Fe(III) complex. Based on the above prediction a similar type of mechanism is proposed for the 2-naphthol oxidation and is provided in the SI (Scheme S1). A similar type mechanism was also proposed by Narute et al. in oxidative coupling of 2-naphthols catalyzed by chiral iron phosphate complexes [82]. 3.2.10 Recyclability test In every heterogeneous catalytic transformation procedure, recyclability, as well as the reusability of the catalyst is one of the considerable features to make the phenomenon an energetically convenient process. A true heterogeneous catalyst can be used many more times in their respective catalytic transformation without hampering their heterogeneity. To do the recyclability test for Fe2O3 HNT, the selective photocatalytic oxidative coupling reaction of 2-naphthol to BINOL was chosen. After successfully completing the 1st catalytic cycle of BINOL formation, the catalyst was separated by a simple filtration method and used that recycled catalyst for the next catalytic cycle. Yet again, BINOL was successfully obtained in presence of that recycled catalyst without losing the% yield of BINOL. A similar task had been taken after the 2nd successive cycle and upto 5th consecutive cycle no noteworthy loss of catalytic activity was observed for the respective reaction. The% yield of BINOL obtained upto 6th catalytic cycle is depicted pictorially in Fig. S20. It was found that after a few consecutive runs, the% yield was found to be less than in comparison to the fresh catalyst. XRD-analysis performed after 3rd and 4th catalytic cycles indicated no significant change in the internal structure of the catalyst other than the decrease of the relative intensities of characteristics peaks for the synthesized Fe2O3 HNT catalyst (Fig. S21). Therefore, to investigate the exact reason behind the loss in catalytic activity, inductivity coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopic (ICP-OES) analysis was performed to see any metal leaching. It was found that although the structural integrity of the Fe2O3 HNT catalyst was maintained after several runs there was sufficient leaching of Fe-content after the consecutive cycle and resulted in the loss of catalytic activity, Table S4. Leaching of Fe (III) over Fe2O3 HNT was also detected with sulfosalicylic acid which binds to Fe (III) ion resulting in the formation of a wine-red complex. However, no significant metal leaching was observed before the 4th catalytic cycle confirming that the reaction was truly heterogeneous in nature."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, it can be said that a cost-effective Fe2O3 HNT catalyst was successfully synthesized and characterized. The material was found to possess a suitable band gap that can harvest the visible light and can serve as an efficient photocatalyst for the selective oxidation of both BAs and 2-naphthol. A moderate to good selectivity was achieved in both the reactions. The catalytic ability was found to be dependent on various reactions parameters. ESR, Raman, and in situ FTIR-analysis studies supported by the DFT study helped in understanding the role of superoxide radicals in the photocatalytic oxidation of BAs. The most significant outcome was in overcoming the limitation associated with the oxidative CC bond coupling of 2-naphthol using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. The present work will provide a suitable pathway in finding out new alternatives towards the oxidation of 2-naphthol in presence of H2O2.
