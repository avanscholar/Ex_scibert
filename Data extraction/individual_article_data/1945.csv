0,Introduction,"Electro-Fenton (EF) is an environmental friendly advanced oxidation process (AOP) and it use electron as a main reagent to in-situ generate H2O2 at the cathode through two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e¯ ORR) (Brillas and Garcia-Segura, 2020). Pollutants were deconstructed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) after H2O2 was activated by Fenton catalysts (Hassan et al., 2020). Bio-electro-Fenton (BEF) is a novel EF system, and the electrons used for H2O2 production at the cathode of the BEF were generated by electroactive bacteria (EAB) growing on the anode (Hassan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019a). Compared with EF, BEF is more energy-saving and sustainable because no additional electrical input is required. Recently, the degradation of various refractory organics (e.g. estrogens (Xu et al., 2013), anti-inflammatory drugs (Nadais et al., 2018), azo dyes (Li et al., 2017), perfluorooctanoate (Liu et al., 2015a), phenolic compounds (Li et al., 2019a), and antibiotics (Wang et al., 2019b)) in BEFs has been investigated. However, the low H2O2 electro-generating concentration restricted its practical application. The catalytic activity of the cathode materials for oxygen reduction through 2e¯ pathway significantly influences the H2O2 electro-generation in BEFs. As previously reported, noble metals (Viswanathan et al., 2012; Jirkovsky et al., 2011), and carbon-based materials (Iglesias et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2016), are effective 2e¯ ORR catalysts. However, the high price and scarcity of noble metals restricts their large-scale application. Carbon nanostructures are widely regarded as promising 2e¯ ORR catalysts because of their extensive sources, excellent chemical stability, and high catalytic activity (Lu et al., 2018). As Su et al. (Su et al., 2019) reported, the H2O2 selectivity of N-doped graphene was 78.02% at the neutral pH condition. The mesoporous N-doped carbon prepared by a mesoporous SiO2 template (KIT-6) exhibited a H2O2 selectivity as high as 93–95% at 0.1–0.3 V (Park et al., 2014). Porous biochar derived from pomelo peel was also verified as an effective 2e¯ ORR catalyst, and its H2O2 selectivity reached at 92% at 0.67 V (Yang et al., 2017). Moreover, the COOH-terminated N-doped carbon aerogel prepared through introducing a small amount of acetonitrile during the polymerization process of the phenolic polymer aerogel precursor, showed 100% selectivity to H2O2 (Zhao et al., 2019). However, complicated steps or harsh conditions are usually needed in the preparation of the previously reported carbon-based electro-catalysts. Candle soot (CS), generated during the burning of candles, is a hierarchical porous carbon nanostructure with a size of 30–50 nm (Khalakhan et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2018; Mulay et al., 2019). Recently, CS has sparked a huge research interest for potential applications in various fields. The CS-supported FeP catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) demonstrated a high exchange current density of 0.22 mA cm−2 and a low onset overpotential of 38 mV (Zhang et al., 2015). Magnetic CS collected during the burning of the ferrocene doped candle exhibited an outstanding adsorption capacity for bisphenol A (65.77 mg/g) (Zhou et al., 2017). Moreover, the CS that collected at the middle portion of the flame was used to prepare super-hydrophobic coating and polysulfone membrane, which showed excellent oil/water separation performance (Cao et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2017; Esmeryan et al., 2016). In essence, CS is produced by the incomplete combustion of paraffin wax, and it can be classified as a type of carbon black (CB). In previous studies, commercial conductive CB and its pyrolytic products have been widely used as electro-catalysts to produce H2O2 through 2e¯ ORR pathway, but its H2O2 selectivity was only 47.0%∼56.2% in the potential range of −0.35 V ∼ −0.60 V (Zhang et al., 2019). CS and CB were derived from different starting materials (Ozawa et al., 2006), and therefore their pore structure and surface functional groups might be different, which would influence the 2e¯ ORR selectivity and activity (Lu et al., 2018). However, the electro-catalytic performance of the CS for H2O2 generation through 2e¯ oxygen reduction has not been studied until now. In this paper, the physicochemical characteristics and the electro-catalytic performances of the CS and thermally treated CS (TCS) have been systematically investigated. The H2O2 in-situ production, and the removal and mineralization of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in the BEFs operated with the air-cathodes prepared with TCS and CB were studied. This work for the first time proved that TCS is a promising 2e¯ ORR catalyst with high H2O2 selectivity."
1,Material and methods,
2,Collection of CS and preparation of TCS,"2.1 Collection of CS and preparation of TCS Refined paraffin wax (64#, Petro China Daqing Petrochemical Company, China) was melted at 90 °C, and the hot paraffin liquid was poured into a mold to prepare a candle. The CS was collected with a glass slide at the middle portion of the flame. The obtained CS was heated at 400 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace (F62700, Barnstead/Thermolyne, USA) to prepared TCS."
3,Physicochemical characterization,"2.2 Physicochemical characterization The morphologies of the CS, TCS, and conductive CB (technical grade, Tianjin Jinqiushi Chemical Co. Ltd.) were observed by a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL, Japan). Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were conducted at 77 K on a Belsorp-Max surface area analyzer (Belsorp-Max, MicrotracBEL, Japan). Raman spectroscopy was recorded using a LabRAM HR Evolution micro-Raman system (Horiba Jobin Yvon S.A.S., France) with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The water contact angles of the samples were tested on the DSA100 contact angle analyzer (KRUSS, Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on an ESCALAB 250Xi system with Al Ka radiation."
4,ORR activity characterization,"2.3 ORR activity characterization The ORR activities of CS, TCS, and CB were investigated by rotating disk electrode (RDE) experiments in O2 and N2 saturated 50 mM NaSO4 electrolytes with the CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua instrument co. LTD, China). All the electrochemical experiments were conducted in the typical three-electrode system. A RDE electrode (φ 5 mm) loaded with CS, TCS or CB was used as the working electrode. Pt wire electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. To prepare the working electrode, 5 mg of catalyst (CS, TCS or CB), 0.48 mL of ethanol, 40 μL of 5% Nafion solution, and 0.48 mL ultrapure water were added in a vial in turn, followed by sonication for 30 min. After that, 13.75 μL of the catalyst ink was doped onto the polished RDE electrode, and the catalyst loading was 0.35 mg cm−2. RDE measurements were performed at the rotating speed of 400 rpm, 600 rpm, 900 rpm, 1200 rpm, 1600 rpm, and 2000 rpm, at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The electron transferred number (n) at different electrode potentials were calculated according to the Koutecky-Levich plots via Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) (Chai et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019b). The selectivity for H2O2 production (H2O2%) was calculated via Eq. (3) (Zhang et al., 2020). (1) j - 1 = jk - 1 + B - 1 ω - 1 / 2 (2) B = 0.62 nFAv 1 / 6 C O 2 D O 2 2 / 3 (3) H 2 O 2 % = ( 2 - n/ 2 ) × 100 % Where j is the measured current density; j k is the ORR kinetic current density; ω is the angular velocity; n is the electron transferred number; F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1); ν is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte; CO2 is the bulk concentration of O2, and DO2 is the diffusion coefficient of O2 in electrolyte."
5,H2O2 in-situ production in BEFs,"2.4 H2O2 in-situ production in BEFs The TCS and CB air-cathodes were prepared through the rolling-press method (Dong et al., 2012), and they were composed of gas diffusion layer (GDL), current collector (CC), and catalyst layer (CL) (Fig. S1). A titanium mesh (5 cm × 5 cm, 60 mesh) purchased from Anping Ruishen Net Industry Co. Ltd. (Hengshui, China) was used as the CC. The preparation steps of the GDL were as follows: 0.60 g conductive carbon black (CB, technical grade, Tianjin Jinqiushi Chemical Co. Ltd.) was dispersed into 12.50 mL ethyl alcohol under ultrasonic and stirring for 30 min. Then, 0.64 mL PTFE suspension (60 wt%, Hesen, Shanghai, China) dripped into the above suspension under ultrasonic and stirring. After that, the blend was stirred and heated at 80 °C to accelerate ethanol volatilization and form a dough-like paste. This paste was rolled onto one side of the titanium mesh current collector and sintered at 340 °C for 20 min to form porous GDL. TCS and CB were used as the catalysts, and the CL of the air-cathode was prepared following the same procedures. 0.30 g TCS or CB was dispersed into 7.50 mL ethyl alcohol under ultrasonic and stirring for 30 min. After that, 0.20 mL PTFE suspension (60 wt%) dripped into the above suspension under ultrasonic and stirring. The blend was stirred and heated at 80 °C to accelerate ethanol volatilization and form a catalyst dough, and the dough was rolled onto the other side of the titanium mesh, before drying at 80 °C for 6 h. The as-prepared TCS and CB air-cathodes were cut into round sheets with a diameter of 3 cm. BEF reactors consisted of two cylindrical chambers and they were separated with a cation exchange membrane (CEM, CMI7000, DuPont, USA). The working volume of each chamber was 28 mL. Two pieces of graphite felt (Hesen Electric Appliance Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were used as double anodes to generate more electrons. The anode near the CEM was perforated with three small holes with the diameter of 6 mm to decrease the diffusion resistance. The prepared TCS and CB air-cathodes were separately used as the cathode of the BEF-TCS and BEF-CB. Two 500 Ω resistances were separately connected between the anodes and the air-cathode of the BEF. 5 mL anaerobic sludge collected from a local wastewater treatment plant (Tailake Newtown Sewage Treatment Plant, Wuxi, China) was used as the inoculum. The sludge was washed with deionized water three times before inoculation. The anolyte consists of sodium acetate (1.0 g/L), Na2HPO4∙2H2O (3.38 g/L), NaH2PO4∙12H2O (11.10 g/L), NH4Cl (0.31 g/L), KCl (0.13 g/L), 0.14 mL vitamin solution, and 0.35 mL trace mineral solution. The compositions of the vitamin solution and the trace mineral solution can be found in a previous reference (Lv et al., 2020). Na2SO4 solution (50 mM) was used as the catholyte. The output voltage (U) of the BEFs was recorded every 30 min with a data acquisition unit (34972A, Agilent, USA) and the corresponding I was calculated by ohm’s law (I = U/R). Each running cycle ended once the U declined to below 20 mV, and the anolyte was replaced with fresh anolyte to start a new running cycle. The inoculation sludge was taken out when the BEFs showed out similar U in three consecutive running cycles. The H2O2 concentration was measured using titanium potassium oxalate method (Ma et al., 2019). To be specific, 0.8 mL catholyte was mixed with 0.1 mL H2SO4 (3 M) and 0.1 mL titanium potassium oxalate (5 mM), and the absorbance of the above solution at 400 nm was tested with a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Japan). The BEFs were operated in triplicate in the fed-batch mode at 30 °C, and the standard deviations of H2O2 concentrations were calculated with the test results of the three parallel operating BEFs."
6,Catalytic degradation of SMX in BEFs,"2.5 Catalytic degradation of SMX in BEFs The removal and mineralization of SMX were conducted in the cathode chambers of the BEF-TCS and BEF-CB. A newly reported neutral Fenton-like catalyst (Cu–Al2O3-g-C3N4) was used to active H2O2 and degrade SMX (Xu et al., 2018), because the electrolyte pH of the BEFs was around 7.0. To be specific, urea was added to an alumina crucible and heated at 550 °C for 3 h in a muffle furnace to prepare graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4). 2.5 g Al(NO3)3·9H2O, 1.7 g glucose, and 0.2 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were dissolved in 20 mL deionized water in turn, and then 0.2 g g-C3N4 was dispersed into the above solution under ultrasonic. This suspension was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. After hydro-thermal treatment at 180 °C for 20 h, the obtained product was washed with deionized water for three times, and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace. The degradation of SMX in the BEF-TCS and BEF-CB was conducted in the cathode chambers, and the initial SMX concentration and catalyst dosage were 10 mg/L and 0.5 g/L, respectively. After the anode chambers were filled with fresh anolyte, the external circuits of the BEFs were connected to in-situ produce H2O2 and initiate the degradation of SMX. The catholyte (1.0 mL) was withdrawn with a syringe and filtrated through a 0.22 μm Millipore film into a vial at fixed time intervals. Then, 250 μL methanol was injected into the vial immediately to quench the reaction. The concentration of SMX was analyzed using a Waters 2950 HPLC with a XBridge® C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm) and a UV detector. The detected wavelength was set at 270 nm. The mobile phase was composed of 0.1% acetic solution and acetonitrile (60:40 (v/v)) with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min and an injection volume of 20 μL. The total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations were measured on a TOC analyzer (TOC-VCPH, Shimadzu, Japan). The standard deviations of SMX and TOC concentrations were calculated with the test results of the above mentioned three parallel operating BEFs."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Physicochemical characterizations,"3.1 Physicochemical characterizations The pristine CS is spherical with a diameter of 40–50 nm and the primary CS spheres aggregate to fractal-like structures (Fig. 1 a), which is consistent with the previous reports (Khalakhan et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2018; Baldelli et al., 2019; Baldelli et al., 2020). Small irregular particles appeared after the calcination (Fig. 1b), which might be caused by the structure collapse or the surface oxidation of the CS spheres. Conductive CB is also irregular sphere and its diameter is around 50 nm (Fig. 1c). N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured to reveal the pore characteristics of the samples (Fig. 1d). All the samples demonstrate the classical type IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops, indicating the presence of mesopores and micropores (Wen et al., 2015). The pore-size distributions were calculated from the desorption-branch by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. All three samples show a peak centered at ∼2 nm, further confirming the presence of micropores and mesopores (Fig. S2). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (S BET) and total pore volume (V Total) of the pristine CS are 61.79 m2 g−1 and 0.4182 cm3 g−1 (Table 1 ). The macropore volume (V macro) is 0.2631 cm3 g−1, which accounts for 62.91% of the V Total, suggesting that macropore is the predominant structure of the CS. After calcination, the V macro of the TCS significantly decreased to 0.1572 cm3 g−1, but its micropore volume (V micro) and mesopore volume (V mecro) slightly increased, resulting in the reduction of V Total to 0.1572 cm3 g−1 and the increase of the S BET to 102.54 m2 g−1. Thus, some unstable macropores of the CS could be collapsed in the calcination, which also changed the morphology of the TCS (Fig. 1b). Compared with the CS and TCS, CB demonstrates a much higher S BET and V Total, 389.19 m2 g−1 and 1.0615 cm3 g−1 (Table 1). In general, the increase of both the micropore and mesopore is beneficial to obtain higher S BET, however, compared with micropores, mesopores are more favorable for H2O2 electro-generation, because the in-situ produced H2O2 can easily detach from the mesoporous structure and diffuse into the bulk electrolyte avoiding further reduction (Park et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2018). As shown in Table 1, the percentages of the V meso for the CS, TCS and CB are 34.98%, 50.39%, and 58.25%, respectively. The first-order Raman spectra of the samples exhibit two broad and strongly overlapping peaks at 1345 cm−1 and 1585 cm−1 (Fig. 1e), which are described as D band and G band (Lewandowska et al., 2016). According to previous works, the D and G bands of soots can be divided into five individual peaks by curve fitting (Sadezky et al., 2005; Kakunuri et al., 2015; Kazemimanesh et al., 2019). The D1 band of the samples can reflect the A1g-symmetry vibration mode of disordered graphitic lattice, like graphene layer edges. The peak at 1585 cm−1 comprises not only the G band but also the D2 band, and D2 band is corresponding to the E2g-symmetry vibration mode of disordered graphitic lattice (e.g. surface graphene layers) (Sadezky et al., 2005). The peak at ∼1500 cm−1 is ascribed to D3 band which originates from the amorphous carbon fraction of soots (e.g. organic molecules, fragments or functional groups). The intensity of the D4 bands is weak, and it is assigned to the A1g symmetry vibration mode of disordered graphitic lattice, such as polyenes and ionic impurities. As shown in Table 2 , the intensity ratios of the sum intensity value of the four D bands to the G band (I(D1+D2+D3+D4)/IG) decreases in the order of CS > TCS > CB, indicating that the surface of the pristine CS processes the most disordered and defected sites (Cai et al., 2019; Popovicheva et al., 2019). Furthermore, some of the unburnt substances were probably removed from the surface of the TCS after calcination, because the ratio of the D3 band to the sum of the four D bands (ID3/I(D1+D2+D3+D4)) of the TCS decreased from 0.31 of the CS to 0.29. The contact angle (θ) of the CS is 132.4° (left)/133.5° (right) (Fig. 1f), suggesting the surface unburnt substances of CS is hydrophobic (Singh et al., 2018). After calcination, the hydrophobic unburnt substances were probably removed or oxidized to hydrophilic compounds, and therefore the θ of the TCS significantly decreases to 29.8° (left)/30.5° (right). The surface of the CB is hydrophilic because its θ is 44.6° (left)/44.5° (right). Previous studies have verified that hydrophilic surfaces facilitated the diffusion of dissolved oxygen toward the electrochemically active sites, which was beneficial to the electro-generation of H2O2 (Zhang et al., 2019). XPS spectra were employed to evaluate the surface chemical composition and element oxidation state of the samples. According to the XPS survey spectra (Fig. S3), the sample surfaces were composed of C and O elements. The atomic percentages (at.%) of the O element on the surfaces of the CS and TCS were 4.47% and 9.32% (Table 3 ), and therefore surface oxidation occurred during the thermal treatment. Among the three samples, CB exhibited the highest O element percentage of 10.56%. The high-resolution C 1s spectra of the samples can be divided into five individual peaks (Fig. 2 a–c): 284.8 eV (C–C), 286.1 eV (C–OH/C–O–C), 287.1 eV (CO), 288.8 eV (OC–O), and 291.3 eV (π-π∗ satellite peak) (Tian et al., 2018). The O1s spectra of the samples can be divided into three peaks: 532.3 eV (OC–O), 533.4 eV (CO), and 534.6 eV (C–OH/C–O–C) as shown in Fig. 2d–f (Qin et al., 2020). These oxygen-containing groups were found closely related with the 2e¯ ORR activity (Zhang et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019), and their percentages were summarized in Table 3. On the surface of CS, the C–OH/C–O–C accounted for 80.55% of the oxygen-containing groups. C–OH/C–O–C can be assigned to the phenol, ether, and epoxy groups, but the ether and epoxy groups are the most possible dominant surface groups because the surface of the CS is highly hydrophobic (Fig. 1f). For TCS and CB, the percentages of the C–OH/C–O–C decreased from 80.55% to 48.93% and 45.60%, whilst, their ratios of the CO and OC–O increased. The OC–O accounts for 23.15% and 18.24% of the oxygen-containing groups of the TCS and CB, and the percentages of the CO are 27.92% and 36.16%, respectively."
9,ORR kinetics,"3.2 ORR kinetics RDE experiments were conducted to reveal the ORR activity and kinetics of the samples. Generally, the higher the onset potential (E onset) and limiting-current density (j L), the higher the ORR activity (Contreras et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2019). As shown in Fig. 3 a–c, the E onset and j L follow the order of CB > TCS > CS. The electron transfer numbers (n) were calculated according to the Koutecky-Levich plots to reveal the oxygen reduction pathway on the surfaces of the samples (Fig. 3d–f). The n of the ORR at 0.15 V, 0 V, and −0.15 V are 2.05 (CS) vs. 2.08 (TCS), 2.10 (CS) vs. 2.06 (TCS), and 2.54 (CS) vs. 2.25 (TCS), respectively. Therefore, 2e¯ pathway dominated the oxygen reduction process on the surfaces of the CS and TCS (Yang et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018). For the CB, 2e¯ pathway was the predominant route of oxygen reduction at 0.15 V. However, the n increased to 2.65 and 3.17 when the electrode potential decreased to 0 V and −0.15 V, indicating that 4e¯ pathway was involved in the oxygen reduction at low electrode potentials. Overall, TCS exhibited the highest 2e¯ ORR selectivity (95.0%∼97.5%), but CB showed the highest j L. Therefore, TCS and CB were selected as the electro-catalysts to prepare air-cathodes, and to in-situ produce H2O2 in BEFs."
10,H2O2 in-situ production,"3.3 H2O2 in-situ production H2O2 in-situ production in the BEF-TCS and BEF-CB with the TCS and CB air-cathodes were monitored. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the H2O2 accumulated concentration curves are parabolas, namely gradually increase in the first 25 h and then decrease. The maximum H2O2 concentration (C max-H2O2) of the BEF-TCS is 32.02 mg/L, which is 6.29 times higher than that of the BEF-CB (5.09 mg/L). For BEFs, the electrons used for oxygen reduction were generated by the anode electroactive bacteria, therefore, I was an important factor affecting the in-situ production of H2O2. It’s worth noting that the I of the BEF-TCS is lower than that of the BEF-CB (Fig. 4b), and therefore the higher H2O2 accumulated concentration of the BEF-TCS is attributed to the superior 2e¯ ORR selectivity of the TCS (Chen et al., 2018). As previously reported, the oxygen reduction pathway (2e¯ or 4e¯) is significantly affected by the adsorption mode of the O2 molecules toward the surface of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. S4, the Pauling mode (end-on adsorption) is beneficial for the generation of H2O2 through 2e¯ reduction, while the Yeager mode (side-on adsorption) is thought to promote the 4e¯ reduction (Zhong et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2019). The carbon atoms in carbonyl (CO) and carboxyl (OC–O) groups are electropositive and they can preferentially adsorb O2 through the Pauling mode (Zhong et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2019). Zhong et al. found that the OC–O group played more important role in promoting 2e¯ ORR than the CO group, because the oxygen anion in OC–O- could synergistically bond with O2 after it absorbed to the electropositive C active site, which could weaken the catalyst–O bond, and make the escape of the generated H2O2 from the catalyst surface easier (Zhong et al., 2013). Therefore, the higher surface OC–O ratio can explain the higher 2e¯ ORR selectivity of the TCS. In addition, density functional theoretical (DFT) calculation and electrochemical measurements reveal that the C–O–C group in the basal plane of the graphene is active for the 2e¯ ORR (Lu et al., 2018). Thus, the high 2e¯ ORR selectivity of the CS was probably attributed to the existence of the C–O–C group. However, the high percentage of the C–O–C group (80.55%) make the CS a hydrophobic catalyst, which is adverse to the diffusion of the resolved O2 toward the surface of the CS, resulting in a low j L (Fig. 3). In BEFs, the H2O2 accumulated concentration was determined by both the electro-generation and the consumption of H2O2 (Zhou et al., 2018). Previous studies have found that H2O2 could be oxidized to O2 at the anode and reduced to H2O at the cathode, whilst it could decomposed to H2O and O2 in bulk electrolyte (Zhou et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019a,b; Yong et al., 2017). H2O2 was consumed primarily through the latter two processes, because the diffusion of H2O2 toward the anode would be hindered by the cation exchange membrane (CEM). As can be seen from Fig. 4b, the electron output from the anodes decreased after running for 25 h in each cycle (red arrows), which slowed down the H2O2 electro-generation rate. However, the cathodic reduction and the decomposition of H2O2 did not stopped. Therefore, the H2O2 accumulated concentrations significantly decreased from 25 h."
11,SMX removal,"3.4 SMX removal SMX is is one of the most frequently detected sulfonamide antibiotics in aquatic environments because of its high usage and excellent water solubility (Zhou et al., 2019a,b). The degradation and mineralization of SMX in the BEFs were tested (Fig. 5 ). The catholyte pH of the BEFs was close to neutral, and therefore a previously reported Fenton-like catalyst (Cu–Al2O3-g-C3N4) with a good performance under neutral pH conditions was used to activate H2O2 and degrade SMX (Xu et al., 2018). As shown in Figs. 5a and 83.0% of the SMX was removed at the end of a single running cycle in BEF-TCS, and only 1.9% of the SMX was removed through the adsorption of the TCS air-cathode. In BEF-CB, the total SMX removal rate significantly decreased to 38.8% because of the low H2O2 accumulated concentration, of which 22.4% was removed by the adsorption of the CB air-cathode. The total TOC removal of the SMX in the BEF-TCS and BEF-CB are 79.0% and 35.7%, respectively (Fig. 5b). This is the first time to use TCS as a 2e¯ ORR catalyst to in-situ produce H2O2 in BEFs. Table S1 summarized the H2O2 production and pollutant degradation of BEFs in the previous references. Accordingly, the BEF-TCS demonstrates much higher H2O2 accumulated concentration and competitive SMX removal rate at neutral pH condition."
12,Conclusions,"After calcination, candle soot (CS) was developed as a low-cost, easily available and effective 2e¯ oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst for the first time in this paper. Compared with the pristine CS, thermally treated CS (TCS) showed larger Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (S BET), more mesoporous and microporous structures, higher hydrophilicity. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) results revealed that the C–O–C was the dominant oxygen-containing group of the CS, but for TCS the percentages of the CO and OC–O were significantly increased. According to the RDE experiments, the pristine CS and TCS are both 2e¯ ORR catalyst, but TCS exhibits higher catalytic activity. The commercial CB exhibits much higher S BET and more oxygen-containing groups than the TCS, but its selectivity for 2e¯ ORR is lower than the TCS. Finally, the C max-H2O2 of the bio-electro-Fenton (BEF) system with the TCS air-cathode (BEF-TCS) is 32.02 mg/L, which is 6.29 times higher than that of the BEF with the carbon black (CB) air-cathode. The removal and mineralization ratios of the sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in the BEF-TCS reached at 83.0% and 79.0%, respectively. This work preliminarily verified that TCS was a low-cost, easily available and effective 2e¯ ORR catalyst, and in future, more CS derived catalysts can be developed by changing various combustion precursors, introducing catalyst supports, and doping heteroatoms."
