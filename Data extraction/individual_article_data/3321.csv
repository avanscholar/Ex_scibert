0,Introduction,"Trans-esterification of oils in biodiesel manufacturing process produces glycerol as a main by-product. Increasing amount of crude glycerol has led to waste disposable issues. Recently, researchers have been studying the possibilities to convert the waste glycerol to useful products, wherein, microbial conversion of residual glycerol has been considered as an economically viable process. Microbe-assisted conversion of waste glycerol to valuable compounds such as methane [1], 1, 3-propanediol [2,3], ethanol [4], succinic acid [5] and H2 [6,7] have been reported. Ito et al. investigated the production of H2 and ethanol from waste glycerol using Enterobacter aerogenes HU-101 strain [8]. Lately, Ngo et al. reported a yield 2.7 mol-H2 mol−1 glycerolconsumed from pretreated crude glycerol along with N2 sparging and pH control using Thermotoga neapolitana DSM 4359 strain [6]. Saki and Yagishita demonstrated the bioconversion of discharged waste glycerol to H2 and ethanol using bioelectrochemical cells [9]. Recently, bioconversion of crude glycerol has been studied using natural mixed inoculum. Selembo et al. reported H2 and 1, 3-propanediol (1,3-PD) production from industrial glycerol using mixed microbial culture as inoculum [7]. Fernandes et al. investigated the effect of H2 production from industrial glycerol waste using anaerobic sludge as inoculums and reported a yield of 200 ml-H2 g−1 COD glycerin [10]. Physico-chemical parameters such as initial pH, cultivation temperature and substrate concentration greatly affect the biohydrogen production efficiency. It has been reported that medium pH and cultivation temperature are the most vital factors that affect microbial growth lag phase, enzyme activities, metabolite distribution and H2 production [11]. In this study, optimal initial pH, cultivation temperature and substrate concentration were tested for maximal H2 production by an enriched microbial community grown in minimal medium amended with industrial glycerol as the sole carbon source. Further, kinetic experiment was performed to study the effect of impurities in industrial glycerol on growth, H2 production and substrate utilization. Finally, the enriched microbial community was analyzed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Glycerol source,"2.1 Glycerol source Pure glycerol of molecular biology grade ( ≥ 9) was obtained from Sigma. The crude glycerol, a by-product from biodiesel manufacturing process, was kindly provided by Savon Siemen Oy (Iisalmi, Finland), The crude glycerol had an alkaline pH (pH ∼ 12) and contained 45% (v/v) glycerol, 30% (v/v) methanol."
3,Enrichment of microbial community,"2.2 Enrichment of microbial community Activated sludge collected from waste water treatment plant (Viinikanlahti, Finland) was used as the seed inoculum. Modified HM100 medium (NH4Cl 1.0 g/L, K2HPO4 0.3 g/L, KH2PO4 0.3 g/L, MgCl2.6H2O 2.0 g/L, KCl 4.0 g/L, Na-acetate 3H2O 1.0 g/L, tryptone 1.0 g/L, cystein-HCl 0.5 g/L and resazurin 0.002 g/L) was used as the enrichment and growth medium. The seed inoculum was enriched in 120 ml serum bottles with working volume of 50 ml sterile anoxic pure glycerol (100 g/L) amended enrichment medium at 37 °C. By the onset of H2 production, 5 ml of culture was inoculated to similar media and the enrichment process was repeated twice. After two enrichment rounds, the culture was grown in enrichment media supplemented with anoxic crude glycerol (2.5 g/L). Enrichment was conducted twice with crude glycerol as the sole carbon source, resulting in H2 producing enrichment inoculum that was used for subsequent experiments."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure Batch experiments were performed in 120 ml serum bottles with a working volume of 50 ml. Crude glycerol (2.5 g/L) was used as the carbon source unless otherwise stated. Batch experiments to investigate the effect of initial medium pH (5.0–8.0) on H2 production were performed at 37 °C and 150 rpm. H2 production efficiencies at different temperatures (25–46 °C) were studied temperature gradient incubator (Test Tube Oscillator, Terra-tec, Australia) at optimal pH and 150 oscillations/min. Twenty-five milliliter tubes with 10 ml culture medium, supplemented with crude glycerol (2.5 g/L) was inoculated with 100 ml pre-culture and incubated in temperature gradient at the optimal initial pH (observed from pH experiment). Optimal substrate concentration was tested with different crude glycerol concentrations (0.5, 1, 2.5, 3.5 and 5 g/L) at optimal pH and cultivation temperature. The cultivation time for all the experiments was 72 h. The experiment was conducted in triplicates and the data were averaged. Carbon material balance and H2 yield values was calculated as reported previously [12]. Carbon dioxide in the liquid phase and carbon associated with biomass was excluded from the carbon mass balance calculations. The crude glycerol used in this study contained 30% methanol. To confirm methanol utilization by the enriched microbial community, a growth-curve test was performed and analyzed the end metabolites produced. It was observed that the microbial consortium did not utilize methanol. Hence, methanol was excluded from the carbon mass balance calculations. Kinetic experiments on pure and crude glycerol were performed at pH 6.5, 40 °C and 1 g/L crude glycerol. Cumulative H2 production was calculated as previously described [13]. The fermentation time for kinetic study was 194 h and was conducted in triplicates."
5,Molecular characterization of microbial community,"2.4 Molecular characterization of microbial community In order to analyze the presence of dominant microbes, 16s RNA gene from 101 to 106 dilutions of the enriched inoculum was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplified products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Amplification of 16s RNA gene of the bacterial community and DGGE was performed as previously described [14]. Prominent bands from DGGE gel were cut and re-amplified using 5′-CCT ACG GGA GGC AGC AG-3′ and 5′-CCG TCA ATT CMT TTG AGT TT-3′ primers. The amplified products were sequenced (Macrogen, Korea) and compared with existing sequences available in GenBank using BLAST program."
6,Analytical techniques,"2.5 Analytical techniques Organic acids, alcohols and carbon substrate were analyzed using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) (LC-20AD, Shimadzu, Japan) and the gaseous content were analyzed using Gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu GC) as described previously [12]. Measurements were repeated thrice and averaged. H2 content mentioned in the study refers to the H2 concentration (%) in the biogas present in the headspace of the serum bottle. The modified Gompertz equation was used to fit the cumulative hydrogen production data obtained from batch cultivations to obtain the major parameters [15]. (1) H = P exp { − exp [ R m ∗ e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } Where H presents the cumulative hydrogen volume (ml), P the hydrogen production potential (ml), R m responds to the maximum hydrogen production rate (ml/h), λ is the lag phase time (h) and e is 2.718 and t. the incubation time (h). The values for P, Rm λ were determined by fitting the hydrogen production data for Equation (1) using the Solver function in Microsoft Excel 2007 by congregating the residual sum of squares between the experiment and estimation data to a minimum value."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of initial medium pH on H2 production,"3.1 Effect of initial medium pH on H2 production The optimal initial medium pH that yielded the maximum H2 production on crude glycerol as the sole carbon source by the enriched inoculum was investigated. The enriched community was observed to utilize crude glycerol and produce H2 at wide pH ranges. Though H2 was produced, a drastic decrease in H2 yield was observed at pH 5.0 as well as minimal utilization of substrate. Substrate utilization and H2 yield increased with an increase in pH up to pH 6.5, after which an opposite trend was observed. Substrate utilization also followed the similar trend as H2 production. The substrate utilization increased from 4.6% ± 0.5 (pH 5.0) to 36.7% ± 3.5 (pH 6.5) and thereby remained stable at higher pH ranges (Table 1 ). The optimal initial medium pH was identified to be pH 6.5. At optimal pH value, the substrate utilization and H2 yield was observed to be 36.7% ± 3.5 and 0.7 ± 0.0 mol-H2/mol-glycerolconsumed respectively. Similarly, initial pH significantly affected the H2 content. The H2 content in the gas phase increased from 0% at pH 5.0 with an increase in initial pH and was 12.5% ± 0.3 at pH 6.5. Further increase in initial pH decreased the H2 content. Increased H2 yields from crude glycerol at slightly alkaline conditions have been previously reported [7,9,16]. VFA and ethanol was produced as a function of initial pH. The inoculum followed acetate-butyrate fermentation along with ethanol as one of the end metabolites. Onset of H2 production co-occurred with acetate and butyrate while an increase in ethanol concentrations negatively affected the H2 production. At pH 5.0, the inoculum showed low substrate utilization efficiency (4.6% ± 0.5) and produced very little end metabolites, negatively affecting the carbon and electron recovery. Growth at low pH values results in reduced formation of intracellular ATP, inhibiting the substrate utilization. Hydrogen production and substrate utilization was observed to increase with an increase in pH (5.0–6.5) in the presence of higher concentrations of acetate and butyrate. Further increase in pH resulted in a shift in the end-metabolite production, with an increase in ethanol production and decreased H2 yield. 1, 3-PD was not observed in any pH ranges. At pH 6.5, acetate (1.2 ± 0.2 mM), butyrate (3.6 ± 0.8 mM) and ethanol (4.1 ± 0.6 mM) were produced. Acetate is the main by-product of cell growth and an increase in acetate concentration usually indicates the improvement in cell growth [23]. Acetate and butyrate production can be directly linked with efficient H2 production, whereas ethanol formation utilizes the reducing equivalents, thus decreasing H2 production efficiency [17]."
9,Effect of cultivation temperature on H2 production,"3.2 Effect of cultivation temperature on H2 production Effect of cultivation temperature on H2 production was investigated within the range of 25–46 °C with crude glycerol (2.5 g/L) as the sole carbon source. The initial pH was adjusted to be 6.5. The H2 yield increased from 0.3 ± 0.0 to 1.0 ± 0.3 mol-H2/mol-glycerolconsumed with an increase in temperature from 25 to 40 °C. Any further increase in cultivation temperature decreased the H2 yields (Fig. 1 ). In terms of H2 yield, much difference was not observed within the temperature range 31 °C–43 °C. Utilization of crude glycerol followed the similar trend as of the H2 yield. Substrate utilization improved from 2.9% ± 0.7–35.7% ± 1.4 when the temperature was raised from 25 °C to 40 °C. In terms of substrate utilization efficiency, 40 °C was observed to be optimal. At optimal conditions (40 °C), the H2 content and H2 yield was calculated to be 14.0% ± 0.2 and 1.0 ± 0.3 mol-H2/mol-glycerolconsumed respectively. Absence of growth and utilization of carbon source was observed at 46 °C. As shown in Table 2 , the H2 evolution was accompanied by the production of acetate and butyrate along with ethanol. At optimal conditions for H2 production (40 °C), acetate (3.8 ± 0.0 mM), butyrate (3.3 ± 0.1 mM) and ethanol (3.0 ± 0.3 mM) was produced. Acetate, butyrate and ethanol concentrations remained unchanged when the cultivation temperature was raised from 35 °C to 40 °C, indicating the temperature range for efficient substrate utilization and growth. An increase in temperature from 40 °C to 43 °C resulted in a sharp decrease in H2 content and acetate concentration, signifying that acetate is accompanied with H2 production. These results indicate that the enriched microbial community produced H2 proficiently at mesophilic temperature and higher temperatures impaired growth and metabolite production."
10,Effect of substrate concentration on H2 production,"3.3 Effect of substrate concentration on H2 production The initial substrate concentration is also a crucial parameter for optimizing H2 production [18]. Effect of substrate concentration on substrate utilization, H2 production and metabolite distribution was tested with different concentrations of crude glycerol (0.5, 1, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0 g/L) by the enriched inoculum (Table 3 ). The experiments were conducted in batch cultivations at pH 6.5 and 40 °C. It was observed that the H2 yield increased positively with crude glycerol concentration up to 1 g/L. Fermentation with substrate concentrations above 1 g/L resulted in decreased substrate to H2 conversion. Decrease in substrate utilization was observed at higher pure glycerol concentrations (data not shown). Theoretical yield of H2 from glycerol is 3.0 mol-H2/mol-glycerol [7]. At optimal conditions (1 g/L), the hydrogen yield was 1.1 ± 0.1 mol-H2/mol-glycerolconsumed, corresponding to 37% of the theoretical maximum. Previous studies on crude glycerol fermentations have also reported a decrease in hydrogen production with an increase in crude glycerol concentration [8,19]. These observations suggest that surplus of organic compounds in higher concentrations of crude glycerol has an inhibitory effect on hydrogen production. At glycerol concentrations 0.5–1 g/L the substrate utilization efficiency of 54.8%–56.5% was observed. Optimization of substrate concentration improved the substrate utilization efficiency by 35% from the optimal temperature experiment. Carbon source utilization decreased with an increase in crude glycerol over 1 g/L. Similar effect was also observed for the H2 content. This decrease in H2 production can be co-related with the end metabolites produced. At crude glycerol concentration of 1 g/L, H2 production was accompanied mainly acetate – butyrate type fermentation at the concentrations of 2.1 ± 0.1 mM and 2.6 ± 0.3 mM respectively. An increase in carbon concentration resulted in a stable acetate production and higher ethanol and butyrate concentrations. At crude glycerol concentration of 5 g/L, acetate (2.2 ± 0.3 mM), butyrate (4.5 ± 0.1 mM) and ethanol (4.7 ± 0.4 mM) were produced. Fermentation with 5 g/L of crude glycerol resulted in an increased ethanol production. Similar results were obtained at higher concentrations of pure glycerol (data not shown). Ethanol production consumes the reducing equivalents, in turn affecting the H2 yield. This is in proportion with the low H2 yield at 2.5, 3.5 and 5 g/L of crude glycerol."
11,Comparison on H2 production by crude and pure glycerol,"3.4 Comparison on H2 production by crude and pure glycerol In order to determine the effect of impurities present in crude glycerol on H2 production, the enriched microbial community was subjected to kinetic analysis of cumulative H2 and end metabolite production with pure and crude glycerol as the sole carbon sources. The effect was investigated at 40 °C, pH 6.5 with a substrate concentration of 1 g/L. The H2 production potential (P, ml), maximum H2 production rate (R m , ml/h) and the lag phase (λ) were estimated by fitting the cumulative H2 production data with the modified Gompertz equation (Fig. 2 ) [15]. This equation was suitable in describing the progress of cumulative H2 production during batch fermentation tests. The experiment was conducted in triplicate experiments for 194 h. The lag parameter (λ) was 6 h and 0.7 h for crude and pure glycerol, respectively. The H2 production potential parameter (P) for crude glycerol (14.9 ml) was more than triple than that for pure glycerol fermentation (4.9 ml). The maximum H2 production rate parameter was 20.5 ml/h and 14.2 ml/h for crude and pure glycerol fermentation, respectively. A lag phase of 6 h for H2 production was observed when crude glycerol was used as the sole carbon source. The enriched community produced H2 immediately when pure glycerol was used as the sole carbon source. The increased lag phase by the inoculum can be due to two reasons. Firstly, the pre-culture used for the experiment was grown in pure glycerol indicating the adaptation time for the inoculum when grown in crude glycerol. The second reason can be due to the presence of impurities in the crude glycerol. After the lag phase, the culture produced H2 in similar fashion as observed for pure glycerol fermentation. The H2 volume increased from 4.1 ± 0.0 ml to 20.4 ± 0.9 ml from 7th to 121st hour. Further fermentation did not result in a marked increase in H2 volume, producing 20.9 ± 1.5 ml at the end of fermentation. After 194 h, fermentation with pure glycerol resulted in a H2 volume of 14.8 ± 0.9 ml. The substrate utilization efficiency was similar for the microbial consortium under crude glycerol and pure glycerol mediated fermentations. Increased cumulative H2 volume in crude glycerol fermentation might be explained by the presence of free fatty acids and non-glycerol organic matter in the raw glycerol. The pH adjustment of crude glycerol converts the soaps to free fatty acids. Seifert et al. obtained higher hydrogen yield from crude glycerol fermentation [16]. Similar observation was reported by Marques et al. on hydrogen production from crude glycerol by E. aerogenes [20]. As observed in previous experiments, acetate, butyrate and ethanol were the fermentation metabolites observed. Hydrogen production commenced with the acetate production. It can be observed from Fig. 3 that acetate concentration decreased gradually with an increase in time for fermentations with pure and crude glycerol. During fermentation with crude glycerol, the acetate concentration increased from 0 mM to 2.3 ± 0.2 mM when the cultivation time reached 121 h. Further incubation resulted in a reduction in acetate concentration. Decrease in acetate production can be directly linked with stable cumulative H2 volume. Similar decrease in acetate production was observed with pure glycerol mediated fermentation. The acetate concentration improved from 0 mM to 2.1 ± 0.2 mM when the cultivation time reached 76 h. Acetate concentration reduced to 0.8 ± 0.1 mM at the end of fermentation. Butyrate production can be the reason for the negative effect on acetate production and cumulative H2 volume with prolonged fermentation time. The butyrate concentrations were observed to increase for both pure and crude glycerol fermentations. During the cell growth phase, in order to meet the high energy requirement, cells produce acetate as the main metabolite [21,22]. At late exponential stage, the cells produce less acetate and re-utilizes and converts the external acetate to butyrate, resulting in medium detoxification and reduction in hydrogen ion concentration [21,23]. Thus the cells shift from more ATP producing acetate production to butyrate formation. Ethanol production was observed for both pure and crude glycerol fermentation. Reduced H2 production from pure glycerol can be explained by the ethanol concentration. For fermentation with pure glycerol, the ethanol concentration increased from 0 mM to 0.4 ± 0.0 mM as the incubation time reached 12 h. A drastic increase in ethanol concentration was observed in later time periods, producing 6.3 ± 0.1 mM to 24.3 ± 0.9 mM as the incubation time was increased from 32 to 194 h. Lower ethanol concentrations were observed when crude glycerol was used as the carbon source. This can be due to the metabolic shift inferred by the impurities present in the raw glycerol. The ethanol concentration increased from 0 mM to 0.5 ± 0.3 mM by 12 h of incubation. Though the microbial community produced 4.8 ± 0.1 mM of ethanol at 32nd hour, the ethanol production was slow when compared to pure glycerol mediated fermentation, yielding an ethanol concentration of 14.5 ± 0.6 mM in 194 h. The increased ethanol concentrations can be responsible for lower cumulative H2 volume in fermentation with pure glycerol."
12,Microbial community analysis,"3.5 Microbial community analysis Dominant bacteria in the enriched microbial community were analyzed using PCR-DGGE technique. The DGGE profiles were as illustrated in Fig. 4 . In the bacterial profile of enriched culture, 4 prominent bands were detected. Following serial dilution, microbial diversity reduced, and bands 3, 4 and 5 were prominent. The microbial consortium was dominated by Clostridium sp. Band 3 and 4 were associated with uncultured bacterium clone (Accession no: FJ512181.1; Query coverage, 99%; Identity, 98%) and Clostridium sporogenes strain CL3 (Accession no: JF836014.1; Query coverage, 97%; Identity, 98%) and Clostridium subterminale isolate DSM 758 (Accession no: EU857637; Query coverage, 94%; Identity, 99%) respectively. Blast search showed identity of bands 1 and 2 with uncultured rumen bacterium clone GRC39 (97% identity) and uncultured firmicutes bacterium clone M0042_014 (93% identity) respectively. Further work should be conducted in order to understand the role of individual species in the microbial community on crude glycerol utilization."
13,Conclusion,"In this study, bioconversion of residual glycerol from biodiesel production process to H2 by an enriched microbial consortium is described. The enriched bacterial community comprised mainly of Clostridium species. The inoculum produced H2 at wide pH and temperature ranges. Optimization of physico–chemical parameters improved the substrate utilization efficiency by 35%. The maximal H2 yield from crude glycerol at pH 6.5, 40 °C and 1 g/L of substrate was 1.1 ± 0.1 mol-H2/mol-glycerolconsumed. Comparison of H2 production with pure glycerol indicated that the inoculum growth and H2 production were not affected by the impurities."
