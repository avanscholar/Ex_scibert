0,Introduction,"Polymers have been used in our daily life in various fields such as medical, pharmaceutical, tissue engineering, coating and packaging products [1]. Therefore in recent years the production and utilisation of synthetic petroleum-based polymers have grown up enormously. This has created associated environmental issues because they are voluminous and non-biodegradable [2–4]. Bio-based films are the promising alternative to minimise the use of conventional plastic materials and to safeguard the environment [5,6]. Polymer blends are preferred than individual polymers for their low cost and enhanced physicochemical properties [7]. The compatibility among the individual polymers will influence thermal, mechanical properties and morphology of the blend films [8]. Natural polymers which are easily available at low cost are often blended with a synthetic polymer for different types of applications as well as to improve cost performance [9,10]. Currently, special consideration has been given to chitosan (CS) due to its remarkable properties such as nontoxicity, nonallergenic, biodegradability, biocompatibility and antibacterial activity which makes it a suitable candidate for packaging applications [11]. Although CS exhibits good film-forming ability, the mechanical and barrier properties were not promising. Blending of CS with different polymers has been proved to be a convenient approach to enhance the properties of the end product. Therefore many researchers have reported blending of CS with different polymers such as natural gums [12–14], starch [15–17], cellulose [18,19], poly vinyl alcohol [20–22] etc. to improve its mechanical and barrier properties [23]. Guar gum (GG) is a natural polysaccharide chiefly available in the seeds of the plant Cyamopsis tetragonoloba [24]. Its polymer chain is made up of mannose [(1–4)-linked-d-mannopyranose] backbone with galactose side groups [(1–6)-linked-d-galactopyranose] [25]. GG is soluble in water due to the formation of a hydrogen bond with water molecules [26,27]. It is used as an emulsifying agent, gelling and stabilising agent hence finds applications in different fields such as textile, food, petrochemical etc. These favourable properties encourage to use GG in packaging applications with other polymers to enhance intrinsic properties of the blend films [27,28]. Among the synthetic polymers Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is considered as a versatile polymer which is non-toxic, water-soluble, biodegradable with good film-forming ability. It is highly compatible with other biodegradable polymers owing to the formation of hydrogen bonds [29]. These properties have been exploited in preparing blend films of PVA with biopolymers, which otherwise possess poor physical properties. The compatibility of PVA with CS and GG owing to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds [26] makes it suitable for blending with CS and GG [30]. In recent years, the awareness about environmentally safer products has created an increased demand for natural products over the synthetic one. Natural extracts from different plants have been used to enhance the functional properties of the active films. Moreover, they are of natural origin and contain many phytochemicals [10] in the form of alkaloids, terpenoids and polyphenols. They can interact through the chemical and physical bond with polymers, thus can modify the film properties. Hydroxy citric acid (HCA) is a major ingredient in the fruit rind of Garcinia species (Garcinia cambogia, G. indica) [31]. It is extensively used as dietary supplements (weight-reducing agent) and also rinds are traditionally used in combination with salt for curing fish [32–34]. The earlier reports suggested that physical and structural properties of the blend film have been improved by the inclusion of different plant extracts into the blend film [35–37]. These findings encouraged to incorporate HCA with CS/GG/PVA polymer matrix to improve the functional properties of the CGPH active films. The objectives of the present study were to prepare HCA cross-linked CS/GG/PVA (CGPH) active films by solvent casting method and to investigate the influence of a cross-linking agent, HCA on different CS/PVA ratio (1:3, 1:1, 3:1) in presence of fixed ratio of GG. Physical, structural and antibacterial properties of CGPH active films were studied and the results were compared with control CS/GG/PVA (CGP) film for its potential applications in food packaging."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials For preparing active films, PVA with a Mw ≈ 125,000 (85–89% degree of hydrolysis) was supplied from Thomas Baker, Mumbai, India. HCA and GG were obtained from Loba Chemie, India. CS (Low molecular weight) was procured from the Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI Tokyo Japan, the degree of deacetylation 75–85%, Viscosity 5-20 mPa). Double distilled water was used throughout the experiment."
3,Preparation of active films,"2.2 Preparation of active films The simple solvent casting method was employed to fabricate HCA cross-linked CGPH active films. 0.5, 1.0, 1.5% (w/v) of CS and PVA solutions were prepared in 1% acetic acid solution and distilled water, respectively with constant stirring on a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm for 10h. The solutions were filtered through cheesecloth to remove insoluble impurities. The solutions of 0.2% GG and 0.02% HCA were prepared in 10 ml distilled water. The solutions of CS and PVA were mixed in the ratio 1:3 (CGPH-1), 1:1 (CGPH-2) and 3:1 (CGPH-3) respectively. To the resulting CS/PVA mixture, 10ml of 0.2% GG solution followed by 10 ml of 0.02% HCA solution was added and again stirred on a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm for 10 h. Approximately 100 ml of film forming solutions were transferred to a Petri dish and allowed to evaporate at room temperature (25°C). The control CGP film containing CS and PVA in the ratio 1:1 with 0.2% GG was prepared by following the same procedure. After drying, the films were directly peeled from Petri dish, sealed in a zip bag and preserved in a desiccator for further use. The composition of the film forming solutions are mentioned in the Table 1 ."
4,Characterization of the active films,"2.3 Characterization of the active films 2.3.1 Film thickness measurements The thickness of the active films was measured using a micrometre (thickness measurement gauge Mitutiyo high accuracy micrometre-S700, Japan) with 0.001 mm resolution. Measurements were done at 5 different positions of each film sample and the average thickness was calculated. 2.3.2 Mechanical properties The mechanical properties of the control CGP and CGPH active films such as tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (EB) and Young's modulus (YM) were studied by using Dak system INC, Universal testing machine (UTM) (series 7200-1KN). All the tests were performed according to ASTM-D882-1992 method. The active films were cut into size 25mm breadth and 100 mm length. The lower grip of the machine was kept stationary and the upper grip was moved at a constant speed of 1 mm/min. The initial grip separation was kept at 50 mm. Three measurements were taken for each sample under the atmospheric condition and the average value was considered for the study of the mechanical property. 2.3.3 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic characterization of the control CGP and CGPH active films were made using (ATR) IR spectrometer (FT-IR-ATR, Prestage 21, Shimadzu Japan) with a wavelength range from 4000 to 400 cm−1. The analysis was done at room temperature and IR spectra were recorded at a scanning rate of 4 cm−1. 2.3.4 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The morphology of the control CGP and CGPH active films were studied by scanning electron microscope (JEOL, JSM-6360). Film samples were mounted on metal stab using double-sided sticky tape. SEM images were recorded at different magnifications. The specimens were sputter-coated with gold layer to avoid electrostatic charging under high electron beam and poor resolution during the study. Scanning was done at 10 kV voltage. 2.3.5 Water contact angle (WCA) measurements The changes in the surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the control CGP and CGPH active films were recorded by contact angle measurement (Sessile drop method, Format Version:3.6). Static contact angle readings were recorded using contact angle analyser (KYOWA interFAce Measurement and Analysis System FAMAS). All the measurements were performed at room temperature. Water was used as probe liquid and the size of the drop was maintained constant for all the measurements. At least three measurements were taken for each film and the average value was considered. 2.3.6 Thermogravimetric (TG)/derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis Thermal degradation of control CGP and CGPH active films were analysed using thermogravimetric (TG)/derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis. The thermograms were carried out at a temperature ranging from 25°C to 600°C using SDT Q600V20.9 Build 20 Shimadzu, Tokyo thermal analyser at a heating rate of 10°C/min. 4–5 mg (according to instrument specification) of the sample was taken in a platinum crucible and heated under inert nitrogen atmosphere (flow rate 50 ml/min). DTG curves were employed to know the maximum degradation temperature. 2.3.7 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis The X-ray diffraction patterns of control CGP and CGPH active films were measured by using X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max-IIA, Tokyo, Japan). Each film sample (12 × 12 mm) was taken on a glass plate for obtaining diffractogram. X-ray beam originating from a copper target Cu Kα (ʎ = 1.5418 A°) source at a voltage 30 kV and 20 mA was used to scan the film sample over the range from 2θ = 0° to 60° with a scan speed of 2° min−1. 2.3.8 Light-transparency and opacity measurements UV–Vis absorption spectra of active films were analysed between the wavelength range of 200 to 800 nm using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Model UV-1601). The film sample was cut into a rectangular piece of the size 1 × 4 cm and placed directly in a test cell. UV–Vis absorption spectra of CGPH active films were recorded using air as the reference. The measurements were done in triplicate and the average was calculated. The opacity of the film was calculated by the following equation [38]. Opacity = A 500 b whereA 500 absorbance at 500 nm and b is the film thickness in mm. 2.3.9 Degree of swelling (DS) and solubility Degree of swelling (DS) was determined by calculating the percentage of water absorption at equilibrium regarding the mass of the dry sample. 10 × 10 mm films were taken and dried in the oven at 70°C for 24 h. The dry mass of the film was recorded. These films were immersed into the beakers containing distilled water (pH = 7.0) for 24 h at room temperature (25°C). After the equilibrium was reached the films were taken out from beaker. Later the excess water on the surface of the swollen film was removed employing tissue paper and mass was recorded. The equilibrium water uptake was determined by using the following equation [39,40]. Degree of Swelling = M 2 − M 1 M 1 × 100 . where M2 mass of the swollen sample, M1 mass of the dry sample. Mass measurements were done using Shimadzu digital balance. The solubility of the film was calculated by the mass percentage of the film dissolved for dry film.10×10 mm films were taken and dried in an oven at 60°C for 24 h. The dry mass of the film was recorded. These films were immersed into the beakers containing distilled water for 24 h. The films were taken out from beaker and the excess water was removed by the tissue paper. The swollen films were dried again for 24 h at 60°C. Mass of the dry films was recorded. The experiment was conducted in triplicate and their solubility was calculated using the following equation [41]. Solubility = W 1 − W 2 W 1 × 100 where W 2 is the dry mass of the swollen film sample,W 1 the initial mass of the dry film sample. 2.3.10 Water vapour permeability (WVP) Water vapour permeability (WVP) of the control CGP and CGPH active films were analysed gravimetrically according to the ASTM E00996-00 method with slight modification [42,43]. The glass bottle with an inner diameter of 17 mm was taken and filled with 10 mL of distilled water. The mouth of the bottle was covered with a 30 mm diameter film sample and it was made airtight by using Teflon tape. The initial mass of the bottle was recorded and kept in the oven at 40°C for 24 h. Mass of the bottle was recorded for 3 consecutive days. Then WVP was calculated by using the equation. WVP = W × x t × A × ∆ P where W = mass gain of the sample (g), x = thickness of the film (m), t = 24 h, A = permeation area (m2) and ∆P= Difference in partial vapour pressure between the pure water and dry atmosphere at 25°C. The result obtained was expressed as g m−1 s−1 Pa−1. Three measurements were recorded for each film. 2.3.11 Antibacterial activity Agar well diffusion method was employed to determine the antibacterial activities of control CGP and CGPH active films against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli [44,45]. The overnight broth culture of S. aureus and E. coli were used for the antibacterial assay. The film solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg/ml of Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS; pH 7–7.2) solution. 15 mL of Muller Hinton Agar solution was added to the Petri dish and allowed to solidify under sterile condition. Further, well (8 mm in diameter) was made on the agar plate. Bacterial culture (105–106 CFU mL−1) was individually swabbed on solid agar. 100 μL of film sample solution was then individually transferred to the hole made at the centre of Petri plate and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The diameter of the zone of inhibition was measured in millimetre."
5,Statistical analysis,"2.4 Statistical analysis All the measurements were made in triplicate and the data were presented as mean value with their standard deviation (mean ± SD). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using standard software SPSS 17.0 for Windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago, II, U. S. A. A statistical difference at p < 0.05 was considered to be significant."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Film thickness measurements,"3.1 Film thickness measurements The thickness of the film is a physical property and it depends on the molecular arrangement, chemical composition and interaction with the solvent during the film preparation process. The appearance and film thickness of control CGP and CGPH active films are displayed in Fig. 1 . The obtained films (control CGP and CGPH active films) were appeared smooth, homogeneous and easily removable from Petri dish. There was a decrease in the thickness for HCA cross-linked CGPH active films compared to control CGP film. The addition of HCA has increased compatibility among the components of the CGPH active films [35]. Among the CGPH active films, there was no significant variation in the thickness of the film with a variation in the ratio of CS and PVA."
8,Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,"3.2 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy FTIR spectroscopy is one of the qualitative approaches for studying different functional groups as well as the interactions among the components of the blend films [46]. The FTIR spectra of control CGP and CGPH active films are depicted in Fig. 2 . The spectrum of CGP showed a prominent broad peak at 3307 cm−1 indicating the presence of -NH2 and -OH groups in the blend film. Also, the stretching vibration observed at 2920 cm−1 was due to -CH2 group and the peaks at 1655, 1575 and 1432 cm−1 were assigned to stretching vibration for CO of amide I, amide II and amide III respectively [47]. The presence of CO was detected by the peak at 1082 cm−1 and the weak band was observed for pyranose ring structure at 846 cm−1 [48]. These observations suggested the interactions between CS, PVA and GG in the control CGP film [13,22]. A noticeable change in the intensity and position of the peaks were observed in the range 3291–3295 cm−1 for CGPH active films as compared to control CGP film. The decrease in peak intensity and shift in the position of the peak towards lower wave number was observed for CGPH active films with the increase of CS in 1:3 (CGPH-1), 1:1 (CGPH-2) and 3:1 (CGPH-3) CS/PVA ratio. This was attributed to the intermolecular interactions between the components of active films through hydrogen bonding [23]. An intense peak was observed for CO stretching at 1073–1082 cm−1 in the CGPH active films as compared to control CGP film. Further, the appearance of a new peak in the region 1724–1740cm−1 represents CO stretching of ester linkage, supports the formation of cross-linking between -COOH of HCA with -OH of polymer backbone [3]. Similar results were observed by Kanatt and Makwana [10]. The obtained results are following Iqbal, Tariq, Khan, Gull, Sagar Iqbal, Aziz, Nazir and Iqbal [22] that supports the formation of active film through interactions between CS, GG, PVA and HCA."
9,Mechanical properties,"3.3 Mechanical properties The film should possess good mechanical properties to use it for different purposes and has to withstand the stress during storage and handling [49]. The mechanical properties of control CGP and CGPH active films were studied and the results are presented in Fig. 3 . As seen from Fig. 3, the tensile strength (TS) and Young's modulus of control CGP film was 19.3 MPa and 238.5 MPa, respectively. A remarkable increase in TS and Young's modulus was observed for HCA cross-linked CGPH active films. The highest TS was observed for CGPH-1 (with 1:3 CS/PVA ratio) and least for CGPH-3 (with 3:1 CS/PVA ratio) indicates increased TS with the increase in the concentration of PVA. Kanatt, Rao, Chawla and Sharma [35] also observed similar variation in TS with an increase in the ratio of PVA in the blend films. The improvement in the tensile strength of CGPH active films was attributed to the addition of HCA which acts as a cross-linking agent. Since HCA contains three carboxyl groups together with two hydroxyl groups and facilitates the formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding with CS, GG and PVA [47]. These findings were in line with results obtained by S. Wang, J. Ren, W. Li, R. Sun and S. Liu [50]. From the stress-strain curve, it can be observed that control CGP film has shown more elongation at break than CGPH active films. Since HCA undergoes interactions with CS, GG and PVA through cross-linking and improves the interfacial interactions due to synergetic reinforcement in CGPH active films. These findings were also supported by several other researchers [1,18,47,51]"
10,Thermogravimetric (TG)/derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis,"3.4 Thermogravimetric (TG)/derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis TG/DTG curves were used to evaluate the thermal stability of CGPH active films. The thermal degradation of control CGP and HCA cross-linked CGPH active films are presented in Fig. 4 . Thermal parameters such as Ton, Toff and Tp for the different stages of degradation are mentioned in Table 2 . It is evident from Table 2. that control CGP film had an initial mass loss comparatively at a lower temperature. The 2nd stage associated with the breaking of bonds between the polymer chain was observed in the range of 162–187°C. The main degradation occurred in the 3rd and 4th stage between the temperature range 277–372°C (53%) and 401–477°C (10.3%), respectively [52]. The CGPH active films showed 4 stages of mass losses due to evaporation of water, breaking of CS/PVA/GG linkages, degradation of CS, GG and PVA into smaller components. In CGPH-1, only 3 stages of decomposition were recorded. The 1st stage of degradation observed in the range 103–159°C corresponds to evaporation of loosely bound water molecules. Major mass loss (45.04%) has occurred in the range 234–379°C indicates degradation process due to the scission of the polymer backbone. The10.26% mass loss in the third stage (395–507°C) was due to decomposition of the by-products obtained in the 2nd stage. But in the case of CGPH-2 and CGPH-3 active films, 4 stages of mass loss were observed. The initial stage of mass loss observed comparatively at lower temperature range (69–137°C). The 2nd stage corresponds to (140–209°C) 11–12% mass loss. The 3rd and 4th stage of decomposition corresponds to 217–384°C and 382–514°C with a mass loss of 51–52% and 12–15% respectively. It was clear from the above discussion that the temperature range corresponding to major mass loss was increased compared to control CGP film. Addition of HCA has marked influence on the degradation temperature range. All the active films have shown higher onset and offset degradation temperature. There was a decrease in mass loss due to cross-linking of HCA with CS/GG/PVA matrix, indicating an improvement in thermal properties [53]. The higher thermal stability of the active films was attributed to the presence of hydrogen bonding interaction and by cross-linking of HCA with CS/GG/PVA matrix [54]. In addition to this CGPH-1 with 1:3 ratio of CS/PVA has displayed higher thermal degradation temperature for each stage than CGPH-2 and CGPH-3 with 1:1 and 3:1 ratio of CS/PVA, respectively."
11,Water contact angle (WCA) measurement,"3.5 Water contact angle (WCA) measurement The surface properties such as hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of the control CGP and CGPH active films were analysed by contact angle measurements. An angle greater than 60° is considered a hydrophobic nature [55]. The contact angle measurements for control CGP and CGPH active films are given in Fig. 5 . The obtained results have shown improvement in the contact angle of HCA cross slinked CGPH active film compared to control CGP (79.8°) film. The tendency of hydrophobic nature was stronger in CGPH-1 (86°) active film. Even though the film with PVA was susceptible to hydrophilic property, as it tends to form a hydrogen bond with water, the result obtained for CGPH-1 showed more hydrophobic nature. This indicates the formation of ester linkage with -COOH group of HCA and hydroxyl group of the polymer backbone. A similar observation was also made in the FTIR study by Chen, Wang, Mao, Liao and Hsieh [56]. However, CGPH-2 and CGPH-3 active films with 1:1 and 3:1 CS/PVA ratio, respectively showed a slight decrease in contact angle indicating less hydrophobic top surface than CGPH-1 active film. This may be attributed to the orientation of polar functional groups of GG present on the surface of the CGPH active films [56,57]. These observations were supported by SEM analysis of CGPH active films."
12,Light transparency and opacity measurements,"3.6 Light transparency and opacity measurements Packaging material must act as a barrier to UV radiation [10]. The UV absorbance was studied for control CGP and CGPH active films and the results are mentioned in Fig. 6 . Control CGP showed absorbance in the UV region (200–400 nm) for the CO group. In the case of CGPH active films, absorption occurred at 349 nm. It was attributed to the presence of carbonyl group of HCA which gives n-π* transitions. The opacity was calculated at 500 nm for control CGP and CGPH active films and the results are presented in Fig. 6. The CGPH active films showed higher opacity compared to control CGP film. It was observed that opacity of active films increased with the increase of CS content in 1:3 (CGPH-1), 1:1 (CGPH-2) and 3:1 (CGPH-3) ratio of CS/PVA. This could be attributed to the cross-linking of HCA with CS/PVA matrix. The addition of HCA leads to increased opacity and decreased transmittance for CGPH active films. These observations suggest interactions among the components of the CGPH active film leading to the formation of compact structure [37]. Besides, Kanatt and Makwana [10] have reported that the increase in citric acid concentration increased opacity. Thus, packaging material can be protected from UV radiations."
13,X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis,"3.7 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis The XRD results provide valuable facts regarding the impact of composition on crystal structure and morphology [43]. XRD results of control CGP and HCA incorporated CGPH active films are displayed in Fig. 7 . As observed in the diffractogram, control CGP film exhibits broad diffraction peak at 2θ =19.4° corresponds to semi-crystalline nature of PVA [41] and minor peaks were observed at 2θ = 11.1°, and 22.8° corresponds to the amorphous structure of CS and GG [58,59]. The CGPH-1 active film indicated minor peaks at 2θ = 8.6°,11.4° and a broad peak at 2θ = 19.5°. There was also shoulder peak appeared at 22.7°. The diffractogram of CGPH-2 with 1:1 ratio of CS/PVA showed a broad peak at 2θ = 19.5° and peak intensity was reduced compared to CGPH-1 (1:3 ratio of CS/PVA). For CGPH-3 the peak values were slightly displaced and the hollow peak corresponding to the amorphous region became broader than CGPH-1. The peak at 18.1° has become insignificant. The appearance of a single broad amorphous peak with decreased intensity suggests the interactions between the components of the active films. The results obtained suggest molecular miscibility and good interactions among CS/GG/PVA polymer matrix and HCA of the CGPH active films [43,60]. The -NH2,-OH groups of CS react with -OH groups of GG, PVA and -OH, -COOH group of HCA to form hydrogen bonds thus a slight shift in the peak value was observed [22]."
14,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"3.8 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Fig. 8 . depicts the surface morphology of control CGP and CGPH active films. The analysis of the SEM images revealed that control CGP film indicates compact surface without pores, however some agglomeration of the particles visible on the surface due to the presence of GG [61]. While CGPH active films possess comparatively smooth, compact and homogeneous surface with uneven distribution of agglomeration of the particles. This may be attributed to the GG particles which remained insoluble [62,63]. The dispersion of particles was less visible in CGPH-1 with 1:3 and CGPH-2 with 1:1 ratio of CS/PVA, respectively. Even under high magnification, no pores appeared on the surface of the CGPH active films indicates that addition of HCA has improved the morphology of CGPH active films by forming cross-linking between components [61]."
15,Degree of swelling (DS) and water solubility (WS),3.9 Degree of swelling (DS) and water solubility (WS) One of the important properties of the polymer active films is water solubility and swelling capacity. Solubility determines water-resistance of the film while swelling describes the water holding capacity of the film. The degree of swelling and water solubility values for control CGP and CGPH active films are compared in Table 3 . The control CGP film exhibits DS of 110% while the addition of HCA has marked influence in lowering DS of CGPH active films. The swelling capacity of CGPH active films can be correlated to the CS/PVA ratio due to the availability of hydrophilic groups on the polymer backbone [64]. The DS was lower for CGPH-1 (1:3 CS/PVA) active film compared to CGPH-2 (1:1 CS/PVA) and CGPH-3 (3:1 CS/PVA). The lowering of DS for CGPH-1 active film containing a higher ratio of PVA may be attributed to the formation of a cross-linked structure with HCA and polymer matrix resulting into the formation of dense structure [65]. Table 3. showed the effect of HCA on WS of CGPH active films. It was observed that all the CGPH active films cross-linked with HCA showed a decrease in WS compared to control CGP film. This improvement in lowering of WS from CGPH-1 to CGPH-3 active films was due to the formation of ester bonds with HCA leading to the formation of dense structure [50].
16,Water vapour permeability (WVP),"3.10 Water vapour permeability (WVP) The measurement of WVP was an essential criteria to use the films for packaging applications because permeability considers diffusing ability and solubility of water vapour across the polymer membrane [66]. In the present study, WVP measurements were done for control CGP film and HCA incorporated CGPH active films. The obtained results are depicted in Table 3. The control CGP film has WVP of 11.207 × 10−10 g m−1 s−1 Pa−1 and for CGPH active films WVP the values range between 5.4 × 10−10 g m−1 s−1 Pa−1 and 6.7 × 10−10 g m−1 s−1 Pa−1. The results obtained indicate that cross-linking of HCA in CGPH active films remarkably decreased the WVP of CGPH active films. The reason may be attributed to the fact that cross-linking of HCA increased the hydrophobic nature of the CGPH active films than control CGP film [67]. Besides, smooth and nonporous morphology of the film assisted in lowering the water vapour permeability of CGPH active films. CGPH-1 with 1:3 ratio of CS/PVA active film showed the lowest WVP compared to CGPH-2 with 1:1 and CGPH-3 with 3:1 ratio of CS/PVA, respectively. This may be attributed to the higher ratio of PVA in CGPH-1 (1:3 CS/PVA) active film which assisted in making the compact structure [57,67]."
17,Antibacterial activity,"3.11 Antibacterial activity The development of active packaging with antimicrobial properties has become an important area of research [10,68]. Antibacterial activity for control CGP and CGPH active films were studied against S. aureus and E. coli bacteria by measuring the zone of inhibition. The values of the zone of inhibition are given in Table 4 . and the images are demonstrated in Fig. 9 . It was observed that control CGP exhibited 16 ± 1 mm and 13 ± 1 mm zone of inhibition for E. coli and S. aureus respectively due to inherent antibacterial property of CS [69], while PVA and GG did not exhibit antibacterial activity [26,70]. Further, HCA cross-linked CGPH active films exhibited an increased zone of inhibition for E. coli and S. aureus as compared to control CGP. The results obtained indicate an increased zone of inhibition for CGPH active films with the increase of CS ratio [71,72] and increased cross-linking of HCA with CS/GG/PVA polymer matrix. Hence, CGPH-3 active film with 3:1 ratio of CS/PVA presented the highest zone of inhibition. In addition to this higher zone of inhibition was observed for E. coli compared to S. aureus bacteria. The reasons may be attributed to the different structure of the cell membrane of the microorganisms. Therefore, the obtained results are promising to utilise CGPH active films for food packaging."
18,Conclusions,"The present work includes the fabrication of HCA cross-linked CGPH active films. The formation of cross-linking between HCA and polymer matrix was supported by FTIR studies and SEM analysis. The XRD data showed a decrease in peak intensity for CGPH-3 active film suggests a decrease in crystalline nature with the increase in CS ratio. The CGPH active films have displayed decreased WS and DS with increased cross-linking density between HCA and CS/PVA/GG matrix. The obtained films have shown improved thermal stability, tensile strength, Young' modulus, hydrophobic nature and lower WVP compared to control CGP film. CGPH active films act as a barrier against UV light and effectively inhibit S. aureus and E. coli bacteria. Overall, the addition of cross-linking agent, HCA into CS/PVA/GG matrix improved the physical, structural and antibacterial properties of CGPH active films. These obtained results suggest that CGPH active films can find application in food packaging. CRediT authorship contribution statement 1) Veena G.
