0,Introduction,"Although, half a century has passed since discovery of photoelectrochemical water splitting by Honda and Fujishima, its conversion efficiency is not enough for practical applications. Direct water splitting requires relatively high energy (<1.23 V) which can be assisted by semiconductor materials with a suitable band position for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [1–3]. Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4), with a monoclinic crystalline structure, is recognized as a promising photoanode due to its low cost, high optical absorption coefficient (104-105 cm-1 at 350–520 nm), well-suited band structure and favorable flat band potential (<200 mV) positive to hydrogen evolution reaction [4–6]. Despite its excellent properties, however, BiVO4 intrinsically suffers from poor charge carriers mobility for the oxygen evolution reaction [7–9]. To date, several strategies have been used to overcome these obstacles such as doping of small amount of transition metals (e. g., molybdenum and tungsten) into crystalline structure of BiVO4 is a simple and effective strategy for PEC performance improvement. Furthermore, the combination of semiconductors materials with noble metal (e.g., Ag, Au, Pt.) nanostructures is another approach for improving photocatalytic activity [10,11]. Addition of Ag into crystalline structure of BiVO4 studied extensively for photodegradation of organic materials [12–16]. For photoelectrochemical applications, Sayama et al., treated the surface of BiVO4 photoanode by silver nitrate solution. Furthermore, lithography method combined with pulse current deposition utilized for deposition of Ag nanoparticles on the surface of BiVO4 photoanode [17]. Very recently, the photoelectrochemical properties of BiVO4 improved by doping of elements into crystalline structure [18,19]. While addition of Ag as co-catalyst and doping studied for BiVO4, however, no systematic study has yet optimized the loading percentage of Ag and its influence on donor concentration (ND), photoelectrode lifetime (transient decay time; τD), flat band potential (Vfb) and space charge layer (WSCL). In this study, we investigate the influence of the Ag doping on photoelectrochemical performance of BiVO4 electrodes prepared by successive dip-coating layers onto FTO surface. Furthermore, intermediate heat treatments utilized to decompose metal-organic precursor of Ag-BVO and prepare a full monoclinic crystallinity of BiVO4 photoanode. The loading percentage of Ag were optimized by measuring the photocurrent density of Ag-doped BVO (1–5%). The influence of Ag-doping on photophysical properties of BiVO4 and water splitting reaction investigated systematically."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Synthesis of Ag-doped BiVO4 (BVO) films,"2.1 Synthesis of Ag-doped BiVO4 (BVO) films Thin films of BiVO4 were prepared by dip-coating deposition of an aqueous precursor solution. The precursor was obtained by mixing NH4VO3 (2 mmol or 0.234 g), 0.84 g citric acid, and Bi(NO3)3∙5H2O (2 mmol or 0.98) in 5 mL nitric acid, 10 mL distilled water, 3 mL acetic acid and 1 g poly vinyl alcohol. Different Ag-dopant atomic percentage was achieved by mixing AgNO3 in the above precursor according to the atomic ratio of Ag to V (0–5%). The synthesized films with Ag atomic percentages of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 5% are termed BVO, 1%Ag-BVO, 2%Ag-BVO, 3%Ag-BVO and 5%Ag-BVO, respectively. After preparation, the Ag-doped BiVO4 precursor was deposited on the surface of FTO by four cycles of dip-coating process with heat treatment at 350 °C for 5 min in air between each cycle to further improve the crystallinity. Finally, the prepared film on the surface of the FTO was placed in the center of a furnace for 10 h at 350 °C [20]."
3,Characterization and equipment,"2.2 Characterization and equipment Nanocrystalline X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed by Bruker D8Advance with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the 2θ range of 10–55°. The surface morphology of the electrode film was characterized with the aid of a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Model Quanta 250 FEG, Field Emission Gun). Raman spectra were examined using a labRam HR micro-Raman spectrophotometer (Bruker, model: Senteraa 2009, Germany) with the 785 nm laser line as an excitation source at room temperature. The chemical states of the elements in the samples were detected using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data recorded on a Thermo Scientific Sigma Probe spectrometer with a monochromatic AlKα source (photon energy 1486.6 eV), spot size of 400 μm, pass energy of 200 eV and energy step size of 1.0 eV. The optical properties of the products were analyzed with a UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer UV–Vis–NIR model Lambda 950). The gaseous products generated after PEC reaction were determined by a gas chromatograph (GC) system (YL Instrument, 6500GC System) located in the analysis zone. The GC system was composed of a flame ionization detector using a capillary column (GS-GasPro, Agilent) and a thermal conductivity detector using a packed column (Carboxen 1000, Supelco)."
4,Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting measurement,"2.3 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting measurement The PEC performances were measured by a potentiostat (VersaSTAT, Princeton Applied Research) in a three-electrode cell, in which the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl and the counter electrode was pt foil. The electrolyte was 0.5 M Na2SO4 which adjusted to pH = 7.0 with sodium buffer solution. All of the PEC measurements were taken under illumination of the front side of the film from a solar simulator (OPS-A500, Newport) with a power intensity of 150 mW cm−2 Xen lamp. To examine the PEC performance of the photoelectrodes, a linear potential sweep was applied from -0.2–1.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 20 mV/s in the dark and light condition and 1 cm2 area of the irradiated electrode was in direct contact with the electrolyte solution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky plot measurements were conducted under dark conditions in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution within the frequency range of 10000 Hz–0.1 Hz under dark conditions. Furthermore, the applied potentials were also represented in RHE scale using the following relationship (eq (1)): (1) VRHE = VAg/Agcl + 0.197 + 0.059 pH The incident photon conversion efficiencies (IPCE) were determined for the applied potentials of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The well-known equation for calculating IPCE may be expressed as (eq (2)): (2) I P C E ( % ) = [ 1240 λ ( n m ) × J l i g h t − J d a r k P ( λ ) ] × 100 where J l i g h t is the steady-state photocurrent density at λ (wavelength of incident light), J d a r k is the dark current density and P ( λ ) represents light power at the specific wavelengths."
5,Hydrogen and oxygen evolution measurement,"2.4 Hydrogen and oxygen evolution measurement For gas evolution measurement, a tight closed cell is used, which is sealed by rubber plugs and parafilm. Ag-BVO, Pt electrode and Ag/AgCl electrodes are placed in three electrode configurations with 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl applied potential. Before starting the water splitting reaction, the 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte which its pH adjusted to 7, purged via nitrogen gas (The detailed of experimental setup are shown in Fig. S8–10). The produced hydrogen and oxygen gas amounts were measured using the gas chromatography (GC) system (YL Instrument, 6500GC System). The evolved gas was evaluated every 15 min for 2 h reaction at 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) [21]. The gas samples were injected in the GC, and the resulting peak areas (AreaH2, AreaO2) were recorded. The calibration curve was obtained by injecting 1–5% hydrogen and oxygen gases in the nitrogen balanced gas. The evolved hydrogen-oxygen gases were calculated according to the following formula: H 2 ( O 2 ) μ m o l . c m − 2 = [ A r e a o f H 2 p e a k S l o p e o f c a l i b r a t i o n c u r v e ] × [ H e a d s p a c e v o l u m e ] × ( 1 m o l 24.2 L )"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Film morphology and structure,"3.1 Film morphology and structure The crystal structure of the Ag/BiVO4 photoanode prepared by four dip-coating cycles with intermediate heat treatment method was investigated by XRD and Raman techniques (Fig. 1 ). It is well known that monoclinic crystal structure of bismuth vanadate shows photocatalytic activity among other crystal structures such as tetrahedron and rhombohedron. Fig. 1a showed that monoclinic scheelite phase with characteristic peaks in agreement with JCPDS data card (No: 14–0688), formed for all the samples without any secondary phase such as MoO3 [22]. This attributed to intermediate heat treatment of bismuth vanadate layer after each dip coating cycles. Ag doping (1–3%) did not significantly affect the monoclinic scheelite crystal structure of BiVO4 [20]. This indicated that V atom are substituted with Ag atom and forming a mixed oxide structure of BiV0.98Ag0.02O4. Furthermore, Raman spectra and XPS analysis of BVO and Ag-BVO (1–3%) indicating the monoclinic structure of prepared materials without any impurities (Figure S1). The survey XPS spectrum shown in Fig. 2 a reveals that the films consist of Ag, Bi, O, and V. In order to exhibit the incorporation of Ag atom into BVO structure, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of BVO and Ag-BVO (Fig. 1b) were measured. It can be observed that after Ag doping the doublet peaks at binding energies of 374.1 and 368.1 eV are appeared corresponding to the Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2 signals, respectively [23]. Fig 2a shows UV–Vis spectroscopy of the BVO and Ag-BVO photoanodes in which with increasing Ag content, the absorbance of the photoanode in the visible region increased slightly. This can be attributed to opaque properties enhancement of the deposited films after Ag addition (refer to S2). The optical band gap energies can be estimated using equation (3) (3) α h = A [ h v − E g ] 0.5 The optical band gap energies were determined from the linear part of the (ahν)2 versus photon energy (hν) plot. The Tauc plot results shown in Fig. 2b suggest a lowering of the band gap from 2.3 to 1.9 eV as the Ag atomic percentage is increased to 3% Ag. This band gap obtained from the Tauc plot of the synthesized BiVO4 is in good agreement with the reported band gaps of scheelite-type BiVO4 ranging from 2.34 eV to 2.40 eV [24]. The valence band (VB) edges of pure BiVO4, 1% Ag-BVO and 2% Ag-BVO films shown in Fig. 2c were evaluated to be 1.91 eV, 1.49 and 1.32 eV, respectively. Fig. 2d shows the estimated band gap information (position) of the photoanodes with energy potential (NHE), which agreed with Fig. 2b and c. The VB and conduction band (CB) of the Ag-doped photoanodes were shifted to more negative locations in comparison with that of pure BiVO4. In general, as the CB value becomes more negative, the number of reductive photoexcited electrons that are generated increases, leading to reducing electron–hole recombination. This band gap position indicates that 2%Ag-BVO has a unique electronic structure that enhances the photocatalytic and PEC performance under visible light irradiation compared to that of pure BiVO4 [25]. The more negative CB potential of 2%Ag-BVO was due to greater loading of Ag metal [26]. The SEM top view images of the Ag-doped BiVO4 photoanodes is shown in Fig. 3 . BiVO4 shows a porous structure with closely arranged particles deposited homogenously on the surface of the FTO glass. It can be seen that after addition of Ag atom with different percentages, the surface morphology changed slightly. This can be attributed to this fact that Ag substitute to V atom in the crystalline structure of BiVO4 rather than surface doping."
8,Photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties,"3.2 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties Fig. 4 a shows typical chopped linear scan voltammetry (LSV) of the pure BiVO4 and Ag–BiVO4 electrodes under on-off cycling between -0.1 and 1.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl. It should be noted that in the dark condition, the photocurrent density is around zero. In other words, photoanodes showed negligible current (less than 50 μA. cm-2 at 1.6 V vs Ag/AgCl) even at high applied potential. After starting illumination, photoelectron-hole pairs generated in the photoanode (BiVO4 and Ag-doped BVO). This photocurrent is dependent to applied voltage in which the higher voltage is applied the more photoelectron can be collected. As shown in Fig. 4a, pure BiVO4 shows low photoresponse with a photocurrent density reaching 0.16 mA cm-2 at 1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. This can be attributed to high rate of recombination of electron and hole due to poor electron mobility inside bulk BiVO4. After doping a small amount of Ag, the photocurrent density is substantially increased, in particular for the 2% Ag-BVO electrode which peaks at around 0.7 mA cm-2 at 1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl (more than 4-fold greater than that of pure BVO). The significant enhancement of PEC performance at low Ag atomic percentage in BiVO4 is attributable to the improved electrical conductivity of BiVO4, increased charge separation and reduced charge recombination rate [27]. Furthermore, after Ag doping, the onset potential shifted significantly from 0.5 V for pure BVO to a lower applied voltage of 0.2 V. However, the further addition of Ag (3% and 5%) beyond the optimal Ag loading decreased the photocurrent density due to the existing defects and traps in the photoanodes functioning as recombination centers. Fig. 4b shows the photocurrent response results of the photoelectrodes for 4 cycles at a constant potential of 0.63 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Clearly, 2% Ag-BVO shows the highest photocurrent intensity among all samples. The photocurrent of 2% Ag-BVO with good stability over time is 5.6-, 3.2-, 2.25-, and 1.5-fold higher than that of undoped BVO, 1, 5 and 3% Ag-BVO, respectively. This indicates that the optimum Ag content (2%) in BiVO4 could create greater strength in the separation and transfer of electron–hole pairs compared with undoped or higher Ag-atomic percentage BVO4. The open circuit potential is measured to further show the improvement in carrier-separation for BVO and 2% Ag - BVO photoelectrodes. Fig. 5 a shows the change in open circuit potential (Δ OCP) versus light illumination density. As it can be observed in Fig. 5a, the ΔOCP value for 2% Ag-BVO increased more than pure BVO indicating a photogenerated electrons production in 2% Ag-BVO due to less recombination. The IPCE (Fig. 5b) result obtained at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl shows that the photon conversion efficiency increased for 2% Ag-BVO compared to BVO which is in good agreement with photocurrent and absorption results. The directly measured amounts of hydrogen and oxygen gases evolved as a function of the reaction time are shown in Fig. 6a and S6. In dark condition, the total amount of H2 and O2 gas generated after 2 h was zero which is in good agreement with LSV results. The total H2 gas generated under the light irradiation for 2 h for the 2%Ag-BVO (the optimum Ag atomic percentage in BVO) was 5.2 μmol cm-2 and the equivalent value for O2 gas was 2.7 μmol cm2. From gas evolution results, an overall faradaic efficiency of 95.8% for oxygen evolution was calculated (The detailed calculation method is included in supplementary information). The negligible faradaic loss can be explained to side reactions occurring at the photoanode surface and possible recombination events at the counter electrode. Furthermore, the ratio of H2:O2 produced was 1.92:1. The slight deviation from stochiometric H2/O2 production can be corresponded to the leak of H2 during manual sampling of H2 for gas chromatography analysis. Fig. 6 c shows the time course of the photocurrent for the BVO and 2% Ag-doped BVO electrodes. The photocurrent remained constant at ca. 0.1 and 0.3 mA/cm2 for more than 5 h for BVO and 2% Ag-doped BVO, respectively. The turnover number of observed photoelectrons to the BiVO4 unit was ca. 40 for 1 h. No change in the BiVO4 electrode after a 5 h photoreaction was observed in the XRD, XPS, and SEM, suggesting that the bulk of BiVO4 and 2% Ag-doped BVO were intrinsically stable for the photoelectrochemical reaction (Figure S7). The charge carrier mobility plays an important role in the PEC performance of BiVO4. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted for BiVO4 and Ag-doped BVO (1–5%) (Fig. 7 a), to study the charge carrier mobility of photoanodes. The imaginary data (Zimag) of impedance, reduced for Ag-doped BVO as compared with pure BiVO4, leads to smaller semicircle radius. Fig. 7a indicates that the 2% Ag–BiVO4 sample has the smallest semicircle radius, which indicates the smallest electron transfer resistance (Rct) and the highest conductivity for photogenerated carriers transport among the tested Ag-BVO photoanodes. Thus, the efficient charge transfer at the interface between the photoanode and the electrolyte prevents the charge carrier recombination and induces easy charge transport of electrons through the photoanode [28]. Donor concentration (ND) and flat band potential energy level are among the most important factors explaining the enhanced photocatalytic and PEC activities for semiconductors. In order to extract the ND and Vfb, the Mott-Schottky plots were plotted by assuming ideal semiconductor characteristics using equation (4) (4) 1 C 2 = 2 ε ε 0 A 2 e N D ( V − V f b − K B T e ) where V is the CB potential (V), Vfb the flat band potential (V), k the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature (K), e the charge of an electron (C), ε the relative permittivity, ε 0 the dielectric constant, ND the donor concentration per unit volume (cm3), and Csc the surface charge capacitance (F/cm2). The Mott–Schottky plot can provide qualitative information on ND and Vfb in which the positive slopes of electrodes indicate n-type semiconductors. We can estimate the ND and Vfb of photoanodes from the slopes and intercepts of the Mott–Schottky plots with V-axis. The decrease in the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot in the linear region indicates the increase in the ND. Fig. 7b shows that the 2%Ag-BVO film has the lowest slope, followed by 3%, 5% and 1% Ag-BVO films, which show much increased ND as compared with pure BVO. Table S1 summarizes the Vfb and ND values obtained from the intercepts and slopes of the Mott-Schottky plots. The donor population of 1% Ag-BVO is 10-fold more concentrated than that of pure BiVO4, which indicates that even the addition of a small amount of impurity (donor) can efficiently improve the electronic properties of pure semiconductors. Moreover, the Vfb was shifted to a negative value after Ag addition (Vfb pure BVO = −0.6 V and Vfb 2% Ag-BVO = -0.5 V), indicating the presence of more surface states which can lead to a significant change in the band position. The newly generated surface states in the Ag-BVO could contribute to the visible light response in the photocurrent action spectrum [29]. The ND and Vfb affect the WSCL (or depletion layer) as expressed in equation (5) [30]. (5) W S C L = 2 ε ε 0 ( V − V f b ) e N D Compared to pure BVO, the 2%Ag-BVO film shows 5.8-fold lower WSCL because it has the maximum ND (ND = 1.17 E+26 m3) and minimum band potential (Vfb = −0.5 V) among the Ag-BVO samples. This lower charge layer can produce fast and efficient charge separation which consequently improves the PEC performance for the 2% Ag-BVO electrode. The transient photocurrent of the prepared pure BVO and Ag-BVO film photoanodes was measured at a constant voltage of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl to evaluate the recombination lifetime of the photogenerated carriers. The transient decay time, τD, which is indicative of the recombination process, is calculated via a logarithmic plot of the parameter D, given by equation (6) [31,32]. (6) D = I t − I s t I i n − I s t Where It is the photocurrent at time t (s) and Ist the steady-state photocurrent. The τD is defined as the time at which ln D = -1 and indicates the action of the recombination process. It can be clearly observed that Ag doping in pure BiVO4 extend the lifetime of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs and reduces the recombination process (see Fig. 8). Fig. 9 summarizes the four parameters (ND, Vfb, WSCL and τD) that are important for the PEC performance of semiconductors. Fig. 9a shows the donor density and Vfb as a function of Ag atomic percentage. The main drawback of bismuth vanadate, poor charge mobility and conductivity, can be improved by increasing of donor concentration. To do this, we utilized Ag as an electron-rich atom which can be substitute into BiVO4 crystalline structure and increased donor population. As it can be seen from Fig. 9a, with addition of Ag percentage into BiVO4 structure, the donor concentration increased and reached to maximum value at 2% Ag before falling off at 3 and 5% Ag. The donor population at maximum value (2%Ag) is about 30-times higher than of pure BiVO4. Furthermore, the flat band potential shifted upward after Ag doping compared to pure BiVO4 indicating less overpotential required for OER reaction. Increasing ND and upward shift of flat band potential after Ag doping, decreased the depletion layer distance and increased the lifetime of electron-hole pairs as shown in Fig. 9b. The resulting minimized electron-hole recombination process increases the lifetime of the electrons and improves the PEC performance. Fig. 10 shows the schematic mechanism of electron-hole transfer of pure BVO and Ag-BVO. It can be observed that after Ag-doping into BVO structure, the donor concentration increased efficiently. Furthermore, the space charge region become smaller in Ag-BVO compared to BVO. Because of smaller space charge layer in Ag-BVO, holes can move faster to the surface of photoanode and participated in oxygen evolution reaction. After light irradiation a large portion of holes transfer to the surface and subsequently the recombination rate decreased within bulk of Ag-BVO compared to BVO. Furthermore, the electron mobility in bulk BiVO4 improved considerably after Ag doping. This leads photogenerated electron collected more efficiently on the FTO surface before recombination. Therefore, the photocurrent intensity increases in Ag-BVO electrode compared to the BVO."
9,Conclusion,"Following the facile and cost-effective preparation of photoanodes by a dip-coating method with different Ag atomic percentages in BiVO4 nanostructures, this study has estimated the key PEC parameters and investigated the PEC performance of the photoanodes according to their Ag atomic percentage. The resulting 2%Ag-BVO photoanode exhibited the greatest improvement in the PEC performance, at about 5.5-fold higher than that of pure BiVO4 (0.46 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl), which demonstrated its significant light harvesting and charge transport characteristics. The total H2 and O2 gases generated after 2 h of irradiation for the 2%Ag-BVO (optimum Ag atomic percentage in BVO) sample were estimated at 5.2 μmol cm-2 and 2.70 μmol cm-2, respectively. The notable enhancement of the PEC properties is attributed to the synergistic effect of the incorporated Ag doping, which contributes to the interface formation wherein the efficient separation, transport and utilization of the charge carriers (e−/h+) can occur. Mott-Schottky and EIS analyses supported that adding Ag in pure BVO, particularly 2%Ag, greatly increased the ND and photoelectrode lifetime (τD) and decreased Vfb, WSCL and Rct. The favorable changes in these key parameters all combined to improve the PEC performance of Ag-doped BVOs."
