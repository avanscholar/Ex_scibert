0,Introduction,"Conventional energy sources, which are non-renewable such as wood, coal, natural gas, petroleum, have been used for a long time [1]. These sources are depleted with utilization in conjunction with the increase in population and living standards. Utilization of the conventional energy sources cause releasing of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere have increased [2]. So, these conventional sources are not sustainable or environmentally benign. This situation leads more researchers to investigate for alternative renewable energy sources [3]. Renewable energy comes from natural resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, biomass, biofuel and geothermal heat, which are generally clean, renewable and sustainable [4]. Among them, geothermal, wind and solar are promising energy sources toward more sustainable and environmental friendly energy economy in the future [5]. The research and development of renewable energy systems are mainly conducted by considering these three energy sources. They are especially relevant to off-network communities, and remote areas. These renewable energy systems rely on highly transient energy sources, and also their energy outputs are variable depending on seasonal and short-term usage [6]. Geothermal energy is obtained by tapping the heat of the earth. Resources of geothermal energy can range from the shallow ground to hot water and hot rock found a few miles beneath the earth's surface and down even deeper to the extremely high temperatures of molten rock called magma [7]. Electricity can be produced by the geothermal energy with some subsystems, and different methods depending on the vapor-power cycles. Wind energy can be converted into electricity using wind turbines. Wind energy has a promising potential to be used for pollution-free water electrolysis for production of a significant amount of hydrogen, particularly during the transition, when the need for hydrogen is limited, as well as in the long term. Furthermore, solar energy is the energy derived from the sun through the form of solar radiation. Solar energy can be converted directly to electricity through photovoltaic (PV) cells and then to hydrogen through the electrolysis of water. The subsystems, such as combination of electrolyzers, hydrogen storage systems, fuel cells and batteries, can be used to generate electricity for these renewable energy systems at desired time utilizations [4]. These renewable energy systems and their subsystems can be understood better, if energy, exergy and sustainability analyses are applied together in thermodynamic aspects. Exergy is a potential or quality of energy [8]. It is possible to make sustainable quality assessment of energy. Exergy is always evaluated with respect to a reference environment. When a thermodynamic system is in equilibrium with the environment or based on condition, the state of the system is called “dead state” [9], in which the temperature and pressure are called “dead state temperature” and “dead state pressure”. These are then considered for exergy analysis [10]. Also, the dead state may be arbitrarily selected, while the dead state temperature is often taken to be equal to the environment temperature and dead state pressure is taken as atmospheric pressure [11]. The open literature has been chronologically reviewed to obtain background studies of hybrid renewable energy based hydrogen and electricity production and storage systems. In this regard, the studies undertaken were only about description of the renewable energy based hydrogen production systems without exergy and sustainability analyses, or energy analysis of the renewable energy systems, or exergy analyses of the processes based only on one dead state temperature. Agbossou et al. [6] investigated a wind turbine and solar PV array based hydrogen production system, including electrolyzer and PEMFC, using energy analysis. They also suggested some storage options. Santarelli and Macagno [12] studied a stand-alone energy system, containing a renewable solar energy supported hydrogen production system for residential applications through energy, exergy and cost analyses. Khan and Iqbal [13] analyzed a 400 W wind turbine, PEMFC, ultra-capacitor, electrolyzer, and power converter. The load was supplied with the wind turbine and the fuel cell. Excess wind energy, when available, was converted to hydrogen using an electrolyzer for later use in the fuel cell. Ultra-capacitor and power converter units were proposed to minimize voltage fluctuations in the system and generate AC voltage. Bilodeau and Agbossou [14] presented a dynamic controller for a renewable energy system with a wind turbine and a PV array to power electrolyzer and store the excess power in batteries. They studied this integrated system energetically only. Onar et al. [15] undertook a study on a renewable energy based system including wind turbine, fuel cell and ultra-capacitor for power generation based on energy analysis. Little et al. [16] studied on the electrical system for a stand-alone renewable energy based power supply using hydrogen gas as a storage medium. Some subsystems, such as solar PV array, wind turbine, battery, electrolyzer, fuel cell, were explained along with a description of the control strategy. Hydrogen production and storage options were conducted. Also, a high-voltage DC bus interconnection system employing standard industrial drives was presented. Degiorgis et al. [17] worked on hydroelectric and solar PV energy based hydrogen production systems integrated with Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer and hydrogen storage system using energy analysis method. Also the description of the dynamic simulation of the system together with design and economic analysis was performed. Furthermore, the design of the high-pressure PEM electrolyzer was described. Zervas et al. [3] performed energy analysis of a renewable solar energy based hydrogen storage system along with electrolyzer, metal hydride tank and PEM fuel cell system. Zhou et al. [18] investigated stand-alone PV-hydrogen system to achieve high energy efficiency via optimal energy management method. They also presented a case study including PV panel, electrolyzer, fuel cell, battery and hydrogen storage system using energy and cost analyses. Beccali et al. [19] applied energy, economic and environmental analyses to a renewable energy based hydrogen production system for residential applications. Many energy systems were considered according to several fuel–device combinations (electric grid, fuel cell, PV panels, wind turbines, boiler, etc.). In the energy analysis Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) method was applied. The cost of energies and CO2 emission were also taken into account. Onar et al. [5] studied wind turbine, PV panel, fuel cell and ultra-capacitor systems based on energy aspects. The dynamic behavior of the system was tested under various wind speed, solar radiation and load demand conditions. Gomez et al. [20] simulated the use of hydrogen technologies, i.e. electrolyzer and fuel cell, and its use in stand-alone remote-telecom applications fed by PV panels. Hydrogen was produced from electrolyzer and sent to the fuel cell when renewable energy was not sufficient. Yilanci et al. [21] presented several PV-hydrogen/fuel cell hybrid systems and discussed their technical and operational status, power production rates and efficiencies. Also, one case study was studied including the photovoltaics, electrolyzers, power conditioning units, battery storage systems, fuel cells using exergy analysis method only for one dead state temperature. Calderon et al. [22] designed a solar PV and wind turbine generators based hydrogen and electricity production system with electrolyzer and fuel cell applying the energy analysis method. Calderon et al. [23] presented solar radiation and wind speed measurement results during the operation of a test-bed hybrid wind/solar generator with hydrogen supported system. Energy analysis was applied to the system components such as wind–solar generator, electrolyzer, fuel cell, battery and metal hydride system. Ganguly et al. [24] analyzed a greenhouse integrated power system consisting of solar PV panels, electrolyzer bank and PEMFC stacks via energy analysis method. The predicted performance of the integrated system was presented for different climatic conditions. Pedrazzi et al. [25] developed a mathematical model and software for solar-hydrogen hybrid systems. The model was implemented as a stand-alone virtual energy system in a model-based, multi domain software environment. Test was performed to residential user data-sets for long term operation. Joshi et al. [26] worked on various types of hydrogen production methods such as solar, PV, photoelectrolysis, biophotolysis. Their brief studies were assessed and compared for their merits and demerits in terms of exergy efficiency and sustainability factor. Hacatoglu et al. [27] studied a solar energy based (base case) and solar-thermal energy based (modified case) hydrogen and electricity production systems along with electrolyzer, fuel cell and hydrogen storage systems using environmental impact, energy and exergy analyses methods for one dead state temperature. In the base case, there were not cold thermal recovery, thermal heat recovery or nitrogen recovery; while modified case had. Yilanci et al. [28] applied exergy analysis and environmental impact assessment to the experimental PV-hydrogen production system mainly including solar PV panels, electrolyzer and battery. One dead state temperature was considered for exergy analysis. Koroneos and Katopodi [29] investigated wind energy based hydrogen production system mainly including wind turbine, electrolyzer, fuel cell and hydrogen storage systems. Exergy analysis, based on a dead state temperature, was applied to the system components for different cases. Joshi et al. [30] studied a comparative performance assessment of solar thermal and PV-hydrogen production methods. Pino et al. [31] analyzed wind-hydrogen system for hydrogen production using energy analysis method. Calderon et al. [32] showed experimental PV-wind based hydrogen and electricity production and storage system. The developed system mainly included electrolyzer, fuel cell, metal hydride bottle and battery subsystems. Also, exergy analyses of these devices were conducted only for one dead state temperature. In this study, a multi-hybrid renewable energy based hydrogen and electricity production and storage systems are developed along with energy, exergy and sustainability analyses methods. Also, a case study, including two-hybrid renewable energy based hydrogen and electricity production and storage systems, is conducted and analyzed in detail to show the reliability of the developed thermodynamic model. As explained above there are no studies including all energy, exergy and sustainability analyses of two- or three-hybrid renewable energy based hydrogen and electricity production and storage systems for four different dead state temperatures. This is the key reason to do this present study, which differs from the previously conducted ones as follows: (i) three-hybrid renewable energy (geothermal–wind–solar) based system is developed thermodynamically, and also two hybrid small scale renewable energy (wind–solar) based system is fully studied in detail, (ii) energy, exergy and sustainability analyses are performed together, (iii) four different dead state temperatures changing from 0 °C to 30 °C with an interval of 10 °C are considered for parametric study, (iv) not only efficiencies but also inputs, outputs, losses and destructions are taken into account, and (v) entropy generation is also considered."
1,System description,
2,Thermodynamic model development,"2.1 Thermodynamic model development The present thermodynamic model includes a three-hybrid renewable energy based hydrogen and electricity production and storage system. The hybrid renewable energies are considered to be geothermal, wind and solar. Each of these energy suppliers is designed to be applied to the same system for generating electricity to start the process. Also, general system equipment consists of geothermal system, wind turbine system, solar PV panel system, charge regulator, battery group, inverter, water tank, deionizer, electrolyzer, hydrogen and oxygen storage systems, PEMFC and a load (e.g. building). The general layout of the overall system is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The hybrid renewable energy systems provide electricity, which can be stored in the battery group or delivered to the electrolyzer. At the same time, water is taken from the water tank and sent to the deionizer, and then sent to the electrolyzer to produce hydrogen and oxygen. The produced hydrogen and oxygen can be stored in various storage systems. Hydrogen is fed to the PEMFC from the hydrogen storage system, while oxygen is fed from oxygen storage system or using atmospheric air. Hence, the PEMFC produces electricity. The produced electricity can be stored in the battery group or utilized by the load. Herein, water, which is going out from the PEMFC, is sent to the water tank to reuse. The geothermal, wind and solar renewable energy systems can be operated single or combined form for electricity demand, and peak time of the system depending on the ground, wind and sun features. 2.1.1 Geothermal energy system The geothermal energy system generates electricity using geothermal source, control valve, injection well, separator, evaporator, preheater, condenser, cooling tower, feeding pump, turbine and generator. The heat, which has low and intermediate temperature, can be converted to electricity by organic Rankine-Binary cycle that uses organic working fluid [33]. If the geothermal fluid has two phases, the separator is necessary. The geothermal fluid heats the working fluid in the evaporator. The geothermal fluid, going out from the evaporator, makes preheat to working fluid coming from the condenser. The saturated or superheated vapor, going out from the evaporator, transformed to the mechanic energy by the turbine, and then electrical energy by the generator. The working fluid, going out from the turbine, is delivered to the condenser and preheater [34]. The heat exchanger unit (preheater–evaporator unit) takes the heat of the geothermal fluid and transfers heat to the process. The secondary (working) heat transfer fluids can be taken to be R-114, R-124, R-125, R-134a, R-141b, R-236fa, R-600, R-600a, R-601a, R-744, etc. The geothermal fluid is taken from geothermal well and sent to the heat exchanger unit, while separator pressure is kept at a constant value [35]. 2.1.2 Wind energy system Note that turbine propeller blades are designed to capture the kinetic energy of the wind. When the turbine blades start moving, they spin a shaft that leads from the hub of the rotor to a generator. The generator turns this rotational energy into electricity. At its essence, generating electricity from wind is all about transferring energy from one medium to another [36]. 2.1.3 Solar energy system Solar PV cells convert the solar energy directly into electricity by PV effect. The combination of solar PV cells is named to be solar PV module, or solar PV panel. The solar energy system uses this solar PV panel to generate electricity. Two separate semiconductors are sandwiched together to induce the electric field within a solar PV cell. The “p” and “n” types of semiconductors correspond to “positive” and “negative” because of their abundance of holes or electrons. Although both materials are electrically neutral, n-type silicon has excess “electrons” and p-type silicon has excess “holes”. Sandwiching these together creates a “p/n junction” at their interface, thereby creating an electric field. When the p-type and n-type semiconductors are sandwiched together, the excess electrons in the n-type material flow to the p-type, and the holes thereby vacated during this process flow to the n-type. Through this process (electron and hole flows), the two semiconductors act as a battery, creating an electric field at the surface where they meet (known as the “junction”). This field causes the electrons to jump from the semiconductor out toward the surface and make them available for the electrical circuit. At the same time, the holes move in the opposite direction, toward the positive surface, where they await incoming electrons [37]. 2.1.4 Electrolyzer The electrolyzer is a device that produces hydrogen and oxygen from water, and it bases on electrochemical process. So, it carries out the electrolysis of water which is the decomposition of liquid H2O into O2 and H2 gases due to an electric current being passed through the water. The electrical power source is connected to two electrodes (cathode and anode), or two plates placed in the water. They are typically made from some inert metal such as platinum or stainless steel. In a cell, the hydrogen appears at the cathode which is the negatively charged electrode, and where electrons enter the water. Also, the oxygen appears at the anode which is the positively charged electrode [38]. Different types of electrolyzers are usually distinguished by their type of electrolyte and/or electrodes. But generally there are three kinds of electrolysis techniques as alkaline, solid oxide and PEM. The alkaline electrolysis has several disadvantages such as, electrode corrosion, relatively low working current density, low pressure, low efficiency, periodic maintenance, electrolyte contamination. Solid oxide electrolysis is inchoate and expected to commercialize in the near future. But the PEM electrolyzers are commonly used and have many advantages compared to the others. The PEM electrolyzers have high efficiency and high working current and pressure, easy operation and compactness, etc. [39]. The PEM electrolysis is named as polymer electrode membrane or Solid Polymer Electrolyte (SPE). The PEM electrolyzer includes a solid proton conducting membrane which is ionical conductive. The components of the PEM electrolyzer are PEM-electrode assemblies, electrocatalytic layer, current collector, bipolar plate and sealing elements. The membrane separates the gases and also works as an ion (proton) conductor. Also, the PEM electrolyzers are required the deionized clean water, so the deionizer can be necessary. In a PEM electrolyzer, water is separated to hydrogen and oxygen gases. Oxygen is generated at the anode, while hydrogen goes to the cathode in order to compose hydrogen molecules. 2.1.5 Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) The proton exchange membrane fuel cell, also known as polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell, is a type of fuel cell, that transforms the chemical energy liberated during the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to electrical energy. The PEMFC employs a solid polymer as electrolyte. This electrolyte is a material like Teflon, which is an excellent conductor of protons and an insulator of electrons. The hydrogen molecules are broken into electrons and hydrogen protons at the anode with the help of the platinum catalyst. The hydrogen protons pass through the membrane (electrolyte) and reach the cathode surface. There, they combine with the electrons, which travel from anode to cathode through the external load, to produce water. The PEMFCs are used in various applications such as transportation, stationary power, and backup generation. They have a high power density and a quick start [4]. 2.1.6 Hydrogen storage systems Hydrogen can be stored in a variety of ways. Hydrogen storage describes the methods for storing H2 for subsequent use. Generally, hydrogen is stored by gaseous, liquid and material based (metal hydride, chemical hydride and carbon based material) hydrogen storage options [40]. 2.1.6.1 Compressed hydrogen gas tanks Compressed hydrogen is the gaseous state of the element hydrogen which is kept under pressure [41]. The energy density of gaseous hydrogen can be improved by storing it under high pressure. This high pressure requires material and design improvements in order to ensure tank integrity [42]. New materials can allow the construction of pressure tanks to store hydrogen at extremely high-pressure values (350 bar–700 bar) [43]. Two approaches are being pursued to increase the gravimetric and volumetric storage capacities of compressed gas tanks from their current levels. The first approach involves cryo-compressed tanks. This is based on the fact that, at fixed pressure and volume, gas tank volumetric capacity increases as the tank temperature decreases. Thus, by cooling a tank from room temperature to liquid nitrogen temperature (−196.15 °C), its volumetric capacity will increase by a factor of four, although system volumetric capacity will be less than this due to the increased volume required for the cooling system. The second approach involves the development of conformable tanks. The current liquid gasoline tanks in vehicles are highly conformable in order to take maximum advantage of available vehicle space. Concepts for conformable tank structures are based on the location of structural supporting walls. Internal cellular-type load bearing structures may also be a possibility for greater degrees of conformability [42]. 2.1.6.2 Liquid hydrogen tanks Hydrogen can be converted to liquid when its temperature is reduced to −253 °C [43]. Also, the energy density of hydrogen can be improved by storing hydrogen in a liquid state. It is estimated that 25%–30% of the energy content of hydrogen is used to keep the hydrogen in liquid form. Hydrogen boil-off must be minimized or eliminated for cost, efficiency, and application-range considerations. Insulation is required for liquid hydrogen tanks, and this reduces gravimetric and volumetric capacity of the system. Liquid hydrogen tanks can store more hydrogen in a given volume than compressed gas tanks. The volumetric capacity of liquid hydrogen is higher compared to gas tanks. Liquid hydrogen tanks can be used in hydrogen-powered applications. Also, a hybrid tank concept combining both high-pressure gaseous and cryogenic storage can be utilized for many studies. These hybrid (cryo-compressed tanks) insulated pressure vessels are lighter than hydrides and more compact than ambient-temperature, high-pressure vessels. Because the temperatures required are not as low as for liquid hydrogen [42]. 2.1.6.3 Material based hydrogen storage There are three main generic mechanisms to store hydrogen in materials: absorption, adsorption, and chemical reaction [44]. Absorption: Hydrogen is absorbed directly into the bulk of the material for absorptive hydrogen storage. In simple crystalline metal hydrides, this absorption occurs by the incorporation of atomic hydrogen into interstitial sites in the crystallographic lattice structure. Adsorption: Based on the energetics of the adsorption mechanism, adsorption may be subdivided into physisorption and chemisorption. Physisorbed hydrogen is more weakly and energetically bound to the material than is chemisorbed hydrogen. Sorptive processes typically require highly porous materials to maximize the surface area available for hydrogen sorption to occur and to allow for easy uptake and release of hydrogen from the material. Chemical reaction: The chemical reaction route for hydrogen storage involves displacive chemical reactions for hydrogen generation and storage. For reactions that may be reversible on-board an application, hydrogen generation and storage take place by a simple reversal of the chemical reaction as a result of modest changes in the temperature and pressure. Sodium alanate-based complex metal hydrides are an example [44]. The material based storage techniques can be categorized as follows: a) Metal hydride materials: Metal hydrides have the potential for reversible on-board hydrogen storage and release at low temperature and pressure values. MgH2, Mg2NiH4, LaNi4H5, LaNi5H5, LaNi5H6, NaAlH4, Na3AlH6, CaNi5H6, LiAlH4, LiH and TiFeH2 are generally used to be storage mediums for hydrogen, often reversibly. Metal hydrides are generally used for PEMFC with a temperature range of 25°C–120 °C and pressure range of 1 atm–10 atm. This is based on using the waste heat from the fuel cell to release the hydrogen from the media. For example, LaNi5H6 metal hydride, which incorporates hydrogen into its crystal structure, can function in this range, but its gravimetric capacity is too low (∼1.3 wt.%). Complex metal hydrides such as alanate (AlH4) materials have the potential for higher gravimetric hydrogen capacities than simple metal hydrides. Alanates can store and release hydrogen reversibly when catalyzed with titanium dopants, according to the following two-step displace reaction for sodium alanate: “NaAlH4 = (1/3)Na3AlH6 + (2/3)Al + H2” and “Na3AlH6 = 3NaH + Al + (3/2)H2”. Also, there are new complex hydride systems. One of them bases on lithium amide of which reversible displace reaction is “Li2NH + H2 = LiNH2 + LiH” at 285 °C and 1 atm [45]. b) Chemical hydride materials: The term “chemical hydrogen storage” is used to describe storage technologies in which hydrogen is generated through a chemical reaction. Common reactions involve chemical hydrides with water or alcohols. Hydrolysis Reactions: Hydrolysis reactions involve the oxidation reaction of chemical hydrides with water to produce hydrogen. The reaction of sodium borohydride is explained to be “NaBH4 + 2H2O = NaBO2 + 4H2”. In the first embodiment, slurry of an inert stabilizing liquid protects the hydride from contact with moisture and makes the hydride pumpable. At the point of use, the slurry is mixed with water, and the consequent reaction produces high-purity hydrogen. There is also another reaction which is the reaction of MgH2 with water to form Mg(OH)2 and H2. Hydrogenation/Dehydrogenation Reactions: Hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions are studied many years. For example, the decalin-to-naphthalene reaction is defined as “C10H18 = C10H8 + 5H2”. A platinum-based or noble-metal-supported catalyst is required to enhance the kinetics of hydrogen evolution. The advantage of these systems is that, unlike other chemical hydrogen storage concepts, the dehydrogenation does not require water. Because the reaction is endothermic, the system would use waste heat from the fuel cell or internal combustion engine to produce hydrogen on-board. Furthermore, liquids lend themselves to facile transport and refueling. New Chemical Approaches: There are a few new chemical approaches. The concept of reacting lightweight metal hydrides such as LiH, NaH, and MgH2 with methanol and ethanol (alcoholysis) is put forward. Alcoholysis reactions are said to lead to controlled and convenient hydrogen production at room temperature and below. There is also another new chemical approach may be hydrogen generation from ammonia–borane materials to be “NH3BH3 = NH2BH2 + H2 = NHBH + H2” [46]. c) Carbon based materials: Carbon based materials are generally carbon nanotubes, aerogels, nanofibers, metal–organic frameworks, conducting polymers, and clathrates. If structures can be tailored at the nano-scale, hydrogen storage may be enhanced. For example, single-walled carbon nanotubes are being studied as hydrogen storage materials because of their hydrogen gravimetric capacities in the range of 3–10 wt.% at room temperature. There are also some new materials. One of them bases on microporous metal–organic frameworks and may be promising is that of high-surface-area hydrogen sorbents. Such materials are synthetic, crystalline, and microporous and are composed of metal/oxide groups linked together by organic struts. Hydrogen storage capacity at −195 °C is as high as 4 wt.% via an adsorptive mechanism with a room temperature capacity of approximately 1 wt.%. Another class of materials for hydrogen storage is clathrates, which are primarily hydrogen-bonded H2O frameworks. Such materials may be particularly viable for off-board storage of hydrogen without the need for high pressure or liquid hydrogen tanks. Other examples of new materials and concepts are conducting polymers. New processes such as sonochemistry may also be applicable to help create unique, nano-structures with enhanced properties for hydrogen storage [47]."
3,Case study,"2.2 Case study The small scale hybrid (wind–solar) renewable energy based stand-alone hydrogen and electricity production and storage system is studied for the case study. The literature studies have been extensively reviewed, and some of the data are adjusted and used to obtain new parameters. The case study mainly consists of small scale wind turbine, small scale solar PV panel, electrolyzer, water tank, hydrogen storage system (metal hydride tank), PEMFC and battery system. Also, geothermal system is modeled but not studied in the case study due to limited data. The specifications of the devices for the case study are tabulated in Table 1 . In this case study, the wind turbine and solar PV panel systems are used to generate the electrical energy. The obtained electrical energy can be directly used for load (house, device, etc.) along with the inverter without hydrogen production and storage operations. But, for windless and sunless (cloudy) days, these renewable energy systems cannot be used efficiently. So, they are used with hydrogen based electricity generation systems. Renewable energy systems can generate electricity for subsystems (system devices: inverter, electrolyzer, battery, storage tanks and fuel cell) and load in efficient days (windy and sunny days), and when the days turn to inefficient days (windless, sunless, cloudy, etc.), at that time subsystems can provide electricity. First, the electrical energy is produced from hybrid renewable energy systems (wind turbine and solar PV panel systems) as explained above. Some of the electrical energy can be stored in the battery or sent to the electrolyzer along with inverter. The electrolyzer takes water and separates it to the hydrogen and oxygen. Then hydrogen can be stored in the metal hydride tanks for the other utilizations. The PEMFC is fed with hydrogen from the metal hydride tanks, and oxygen from air. Hence, electrical energy is generated from PEMFC. Some necessary system parameters of the case study are tabulated in Table 2 ."
4,Analysis,"Renewable energies considered in the present investigation include geothermal, solar and wind for the modeled system, while only solar and wind energies are considered for case study due to collection of the data. But, energy and exergy analyses methods of the whole system are shown to describe the methodology clearly."
5,Energy analysis,"3.1 Energy analysis The literature has been investigated and in this regard, some assumptions are made. Only energy of hydrogen is assumed to be energy output for electrolyzer. 3.1.1 Geothermal system The energy balance of the geothermal system is calculated to be (1) Δ E n ⋅ G , in = Δ E n ⋅ G , out + E n ⋅ G , loss where “ Δ E n ⋅ G , in ”, “ Δ E n ⋅ G , out ” and “ E n ⋅ G , loss ” are the net energy input, net useful (obtained) energy output and energy (heat) loss rates of the geothermal system. Also, subscript “G” is “geothermal”. The net energy input rate of the geothermal system “ Δ E n ⋅ G , in ” is determined by (2) Δ E n ⋅ G , in = m ˙ G , 1 ( h 1 a − h 1 c ) G where “ m ˙ ” is the mass flow rate, “h” is the enthalpy, and subscript “1” is geothermal fluid. The energy (heat) loss rate of the geothermal system is found as follows: (3) E n ⋅ G , loss = Q ˙ G , loss = ∑ Q ˙ G , i ξ G , loss where “ Q ˙ G , loss ” is the heat loss rate of the geothermal system, “ξ G ,loss” is the percentage of heat loss from geothermal fluid to the outside, and subscript “i” is the ith component. The electrical power production (net useful energy output) “ Δ E n ⋅ G , out ” of the geothermal system can be obtained as follows: (4) Δ E n ⋅ G , out = W ˙ G , G − W ˙ G , P = η G , G W ˙ G , T − W ˙ G , P = η G , G [ m ˙ G , 2 ( h 2 a − h 2 b ) G ] − m ˙ G , 2 ( h 2 d − h 2 c ) G where “ W ˙ G , G ” is the produced power at generator, “ W ˙ G , P ” is the necessary power for condenser pump, “ W ˙ G , T ” is the generated power at turbine of the geothermal system, “η G ,G” is the generator efficiency, “h 2a ” is the working fluid enthalpy at turbine inlet, and “h 2b ” is the working fluid enthalpy at turbine outlet, “h 2c ” is the working fluid enthalpy at condenser input, and “h 2d ” is the working fluid enthalpy at output. The electricity (electrical energy) production of the geothermal system is determined by (5) E n G , net = t G , sys Δ E n ⋅ G , out = t G , sys ( W ˙ G , G − W ˙ G , P ) where “En G,net” is the electrical energy production and “t G ,sys” is the working hour of the geothermal system in a year. The energy (thermal) efficiency of the geothermal system “η G” is found to be (6) η G = Net useful energy output Net energy input = Δ E n ⋅ G , out Δ E n ⋅ G , in = W ˙ G , G − W ˙ G , P m ˙ G , 1 ( h 1 a − h 1 c ) G 3.1.2 Wind turbine The energy balance of the wind turbine for the case study is given as follows: (7) E n ⋅ WT , air , kin − E n ⋅ WT , out , usf − E n ⋅ WT , loss = 0 where “ E n ⋅ WT , air , kin ”, “ E n ⋅ WT , out , usf ” and “ E n ⋅ WT , loss ” are the kinetic energy rate of the air, the net useful energy output rate, and the energy loss rate for the wind turbine, respectively. (8) E n ⋅ WT , air , kin = 1 2 m ˙ WT , a V wind , in 2 where “ m ˙ WT , a ” is the mass flow rate of the air and “V wind,in” is the inlet wind velocity for the wind turbine. (9) E n ⋅ WT , out , usf = V WT I WT where “V WT” and “I WT” are the characteristic voltage and current of the wind turbine. (10) E n ⋅ WT , loss = E n ⋅ WT , air , kin − E n ⋅ WT , out , usf The energy efficiency of the wind turbine “η WT” is obtained as follows: (11) η WT = E n ⋅ WT , out , usf E n ⋅ WT , air , kin 3.1.3 Solar PV panels The energy balance of the solar PV panel for the case study is expressed as follows: (12) E n ⋅ S , in − E n ⋅ S , out , usf − E n ⋅ S , loss = 0 where “ E n ⋅ S , in ”, “ E n ⋅ S , out , usf ” and “ E n ⋅ S , loss ” are the energy input, net useful energy output and total energy loss rates of the solar PV panel, respectively. (13) E n ⋅ S , in = S ¯ T A S where “ S ¯ T ” is the total solar radiation rate and “A S” is the effective solar PV panel area. (14) E n ⋅ S , out , usf = V S , oc I S , sc where “V S ,oc” is the produced open circuit voltage and “I S ,sc” is the short circuit current of the solar PV panel. (15) E n ⋅ S , loss = E n ⋅ S , in − E n ⋅ S , out , usf Also, the heat transfer loss rate of the solar PV panel “ Q ˙ S , loss , HT ” is given by (16) Q ˙ S , loss , HT = U S A S ( T S , panel − T env ) where “U S” is the overall heat transfer, “T S ,panel” is the solar PV panel surface temperature and “T env” is the environment air temperature. The energy efficiency of the solar PV panel “η S” is expressed by; (17) η S = E n ⋅ S , out , usf E n ⋅ S , in 3.1.4 Electrolyzer The reaction of the electrolyzer is explained to be “H2O + Electrical Power → H2 + (1/2)O2” [4]. So, the energy balance of the electrolyzer for the case study is written as follows: (18) E n ⋅ Elz , in − E n ⋅ Elz , out , H 2 − E n ⋅ Elz , loss = 0 where “ E n ⋅ Elz , in ”, “ E n ⋅ Elz , out , H 2 ” and “ E n ⋅ Elz , loss ” are the energy input, useful hydrogen energy output and energy loss rates of the electrolyzer, respectively.

6,Exergy analysis,"3.2 Exergy analysis Some assumptions have been made for the exergy analysis. For the wind turbine, flow exergy of the air is neglected, only kinetic exergy changing of the air is considered to be exergy input. For the electrolyzer, exergy of the water and exergy of the oxygen are neglected, and also only electrical power input is considered to be exergy input. For the PEMFC, only exergy of hydrogen is accepted to be net exergy input, and also exergies of the oxygen and water are neglected. These assumptions are also generally accepted by many researchers in the thermodynamics aspects. In this section exergy analysis of the case study is given. 3.2.1 Geothermal system The exergy balance of the geothermal system is expressed as (35) E x ⋅ G , work , in + E x ⋅ G , mass , in = E x ⋅ G , mass , out + E x ⋅ G , work , out + E x ⋅ G , loss + E x ⋅ G , dest or (36) Δ E x ⋅ G , mass = Δ E x ⋅ G , work + E x ⋅ G , loss + E x ⋅ G , dest where “ E x ⋅ G , work ”, “ E x ⋅ G , mass ”, “ E x ⋅ G , loss ”, “ Δ E x ⋅ G , mass ” and “ Δ E x ⋅ G , work ” are the exergy work rate, mass flow exergy rate, exergy loss rate, net mass flow exergy (input) rate and net useful exergy work (output) rate of the geothermal system, respectively.

7,Sustainability analysis,"3.3 Sustainability analysis Exergy analysis provides opportunity to improve the performance of a system. Another way to understand the scope for improvement at the design stage as well as in the existing system is through the sustainability index (SI). This index gives some indications about how exergy efficiency affects the sustainability of the resources or systems. It is directly related to exergy efficiency (Ψ). So, it shows how exergy methods are essential in improving efficiency that allows society to maximize the benefits. A higher sustainability index shows better sustainability of the process/unit. The SI can be explained as follows [49,50]: (69) S I = 1 1 − Ψ Also, the relative irreversibility (RI), which is the ratio of the related system's exergy destruction ( E x ⋅ dest , i ) to overall (total) system's exergy destruction, can be found from [51]: (70) R I = E x ⋅ dest , i E x ⋅ dest , total"
8,Results and discussion,"Energy, exergy and sustainability analyses are applied to the wind turbine, solar PV panel, electrolyzer and PEMFC of the proposed case study. Four different dead state temperature values varying from 0 °C to 30 °C with 10 °C step are considered for the exergy and sustainability analyses, while environment temperature is 30 °C. First, energy analysis is applied to the system according to the first law of thermodynamics. The energy analysis results of the case study are given in Table 3 . Also, the energy efficiency results of the case study are illustrated in Fig. 2 . The maximum energy efficiency is found for electrolyzer to be 53.55%, while minimum one is determined for solar PV panel to be 9.06%. Furthermore, the overall energy efficiency of the system is calculated as 3.44% and the total energy efficiency of the renewable energy resources is computed to be 19.45%. Exergy and sustainability analyses are then applied to the system devices along with first and second laws of thermodynamics for four different dead state temperatures because exergy analyses results are seen to be more reliable in designing and assessing the systems. The exergy and sustainability analyses results of the case study are shown in Table 4 . The overall exergy efficiency and sustainability index of the system are directly proportional with dead state temperature variations. The maximum overall exergy efficiency of the system is calculated to be 5.865% at 30 °C dead state temperature and the minimum one is obtained as 5.838% at 0 °C dead state temperature. Also, the maximum and minimum total exergy efficiency of the renewable energy resources are determined as 33.18% and 33.03% at 30°C and 0°C dead state temperature, respectively. Furthermore, the maximum and minimum overall sustainability index rates of the system are found to be 1.0623 and 1.0620 at 30°C and 0°C dead state temperatures, respectively. The energy and exergy analyses results of the wind turbine are given in Fig. 3 to show the differences between energetic and exergetic rates. The kinetic energy and kinetic exergy of the air are accepted to be energy and exergy inputs, respectively. The flow exergy of the air is neglected. The exergy analysis of the wind turbine mainly consists of kinetic exergy changing of air (net exergy input), electrical power outlet (exergy output) and exergy destruction. So, exergy analysis results do not change with dead state temperature variations. The energy input rate is found to be 191.19 W, while net exergy input rate is determined to be 69.73 W for the wind turbine. The energy and exergy output rates of the wind turbine are calculated to be 50 W. The energy and exergy output rates of the wind turbine are same, because, output is electrical which is not affected by the dead state temperature. In addition, the exergy efficiency of the wind turbine is found to be 71.70%. The energy analysis results of the solar PV panel are shown in Fig. 4 . Furthermore, the exergy analysis results of the solar PV panel are given in Fig. 5 . Most of energy or exergy are lost or destructed due to PV conversion of silicon modules. So, exergy efficiencies and sustainability index of this kind of solar PV panel are less than other types. The energy loss rate of the solar PV panel is determined to be 112.04 W, and 23.37 W of this loss occurs due to heat transfer. The maximum and minimum exergy loss rates of the solar PV panel are found to be 2.58 W and 0.30 W at 0 °C and 30 °C dead state temperatures, respectively. Also, the maximum and minimum exergy destruction rates of the solar PV panel are obtained to be 103.12 W and 101.69 W at 30 °C and 0 °C dead state temperatures, respectively. The exergy efficiency and sustainability index variations of the solar PV panel are illustrated in Fig. 6 . The maximum and minimum exergy efficiency rates of the solar PV panel are computed to be 9.74% and 9.67% at 30 °C and 0 °C dead state temperatures, respectively. Also, the maximum and minimum sustainability index rates of the solar PV panel are found to be 1.107907 and 1.107025 at 30 °C and 0 °C dead state temperatures, respectively. The entropy generation rates of the renewable energy sources are given in Fig. 7 . The increase of the dead state temperature decreases the entropy generation. For the wind turbine energy system, maximum and minimum entropy generation rates are found to be 0.072238 W/K and 0.065089 W/K at 0 °C and 30 °C dead state temperature values, respectively. Also, for the solar PV energy system, maximum and minimum entropy generation rates are found to be 0.372279 W/K and 0.340154 W/K at dead state temperature values of 0 °C and 30 °C, respectively. The exergy input and output variations of the electrolyzer are represented in Fig. 8 . The exergy input rate of the electrolyzer is constant to be 43.02 W. The useful exergy output is determined from exergy of the hydrogen for the electrolyzer. The maximum exergy output of the electrolyzer is computed to be 23.06 W at 30 °C dead state temperature. Also, the exergy efficiency and sustainability index variations of the electrolyzer are indicated in Fig. 9 . The exergy efficiency and SI charts of the electrolyzer are similar with each other. They are maximum at 30 °C dead state temperature, and minimum at 0 °C dead state temperature for the electrolyzer. Finally, the exergy input and output variations of the PEMFC are illustrated in Fig. 10 . The exergy input is also named to be exergy of hydrogen, and it changes with dead state temperatures for the PEMFC. The maximum exergy input rate of the PEMFC is calculated to be 43.66 W at dead state temperature of 30 °C. Also, the exergy output rate of the PEMFC is electrical power output. So, it is found from voltage and current of the PEMFC, and constant to be 14.40 W. Furthermore, the exergy destruction variations of the electrolyzer and PEMFC are given in Fig. 11 . It is directly proportional with the dead state temperature variation and maximum at 30 °C dead state temperature to be 29.26 W for the PEMFC, while it is inversely proportional with the dead state temperature variation and maximum at 0 °C dead state temperature to be 19.99 W for the electrolyzer. The exergy efficiency and sustainability index variations of the PEMFC are shown in Fig. 12 . Both the exergy efficiency and the SI rates of the PEMFC are inversely proportional with the dead state temperature variation. Besides, the relative irreversibility (RI) results of the system components are tabulated in Table 5 . As is seen in this table, the maximum RI result is found for the solar PV panel for all of the dead state temperatures, while minimum one is found for wind turbine."
9,Conclusions,"In this study, we have investigated hybrid renewable energy based hydrogen and electricity production and storage systems in detail. We have presented a thermodynamic model for a hybrid geothermal–wind–solar renewable energy based system. Also, we have given a case study and analyzed it through energy, exergy and sustainability analyses to show the reliability of the developed thermodynamic model (without geothermal system). We have parametrically studied on the case study under various dead state temperature values of 0 °C, 10 °C, 20 °C and 30 °C for the exergy and sustainability analyses. We have extracted the following main conclusions from the present study: • For the renewable energy resources, the maximum exergy efficiency is found for the wind turbine system, while the minimum exergy efficiency is obtained for the solar PV panel at 0 °C dead state temperature. Wind turbine uses kinetic energy of air while solar PV panel uses solar radiation energy and causes loss due to PV conversion of silicon modules. So, almost 90% of the solar energy is lost or destructed by the solar PV panel. • For the wind turbine, energetic input and output rates are higher than exergetic ones. Only energy and exergy output rates are same. Useful power output of the wind turbine only consists of electrical power, and is not affected by the dead state temperature variations. So, electrical power outlet is equal to exergetic power outlet. • 73.85% of the energy input rate is lost and 19.73% of the exergy input rate is destructed in the wind turbine due to mechanical design of the wind turbine system which directly produces electrical energy. • For the wind turbine, the energy efficiency is lower than its corresponding exergy efficiency. Because, in the energy analysis, only kinetic energy of the inlet air is taken into account. But in the exergy analysis, both inlet and outlet kinetic exergy rates of the air are considered, and their differences are accepted to be the net exergy input. • For the solar PV panel, the energy efficiency is lower than its corresponding exergy efficiency due to the analysis of solar radiation. The solar radiation causes solar energy and exergy inputs for the solar PV panel. But, in the exergy analysis, solar exergy input is lower than solar energy input. Because solar exergy additionally considers the sun and dead state temperatures, while solar energy is not. • The exergy loss rate of the solar PV panel depends on heat loss rate, PV panel and dead state temperatures. If the dead state temperature increases, exergy loss of the solar PV panel decreases. Increasing the exergy loss rate reduces exergy destruction for the solar PV panel. • The exergy efficiency of the electrolyzer increases with increasing the dead state temperature. The variation is related to exergy output rate (hydrogen exergy rate) of the electrolyzer. Because, net exergy input rate consists of electrical power input, and it is constant. But, exergy output rate is changing with dead state temperature variations; also it is directly proportional with dead state temperature for the electrolyzer. • The exergy efficiency of the PEMFC decreases with the increase in the dead state temperature due to exergy input rate (hydrogen exergy rate) of the PEMFC. Because, useful exergy output rate consists of electrical power output, and it is constant. But, exergy input rate is changing with dead state temperature variations; also it is directly proportional to dead state temperature for the PEMFC. If higher heating value of the hydrogen could be considered, energy input rate of the PEMFC would be increased and so, energy efficiency of the PEMFC would be lower. • The exergy destruction rates of the electrolyzer are inversely proportional to dead state temperature variation, while the exergy destruction rates of the PEMFC are directly proportional. • If the system devices are considered, maximum exergy efficiency occurs for the wind turbine system which generates major necessary electricity for the system devices and load. The second highest exergy efficiency is found for the electrolyzer, and the third highest one is obtained for PEMFC. The minimum exergy efficiency is found for the solar PV panel which can be considered to be minor electricity generator to support the system. Also, the energy efficiencies of the system devices from maximum to minimum are found for the electrolyzer, PEMFC, wind turbine and solar PV panel, respectively. • The entropy generations of the renewable energy sources are inversely proportional with dead state temperature variations. So, if the renewable energy systems design with exergy approach at low dead state temperature, the entropy generation can be minimized. • Sustainability analyses results of the system devices are similar to their exergy efficiencies. Because, sustainability index method bases on exergy efficiency and directly proportional with it. The maximum sustainable system device is the wind turbine, and minimum one is the solar PV panel. • The overall exergy efficiency is higher than its corresponding energy efficiency for the system (case study). Furthermore, overall sustainability index is directly proportional to the dead state temperature variation. It becomes the highest one at a 30 °C dead state temperature. The renewable hybrid systems with hydrogen and electricity production and storage can be used for various applications, such as stand-alone, stationary, mobile, etc. The solar PV system's efficiency could be increased, if the new materials, which do not cause much loss or destruction, would be used. Also, energy, exergy and sustainability analysis methods should be used for the hybrid renewable energy systems' design, while dead state temperature is accepted to be equal to the high level environment temperature to obtain high efficiency. Furthermore, it should be noted that the overall exergy efficiency of the system is not changing much with respect to the dead state (5.838%–5.865%). Hence the effect of dead state temperature appears to be negligible for the present system. Besides, maximum relative irreversibility (RI) is found for solar PV panel among the system components. So, solar PV system has more exergy destruction and improvement is necessary for it. On the other hand, changing the number of solar PV panels affects the overall system efficiency. If more solar PV panels were used, the overall system efficiency would increase. So, utilization of hybrid renewable energy systems is suggested. This study helps give a good insight to researchers and designers working in areas of hybrid renewable energies and hydrogen/electricity production systems for better operation and assessment. In a future work, a thermo-economic assessment of this system is aimed."
