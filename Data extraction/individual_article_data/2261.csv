0,Introduction,"Over the last 30 years, obesity has changed from being an outstanding occurrence to a condition affecting a significant proportion of the population (Haslam, 2016). In the United States of America, two-thirds of the adult population is obese or overweight, and approximately 17% of children and adolescent are obese (Farran, Ellis, & Barron, 2013). Americans spend about $200 billion annually in medical expenses to address diseases closely related to obesity (AANP Forum, 2016). The alarming prevalence of obesity has been attributed to a variety of socio-economic factors including eating behavior, sedentary lifestyle, genetics, and dietary patterns (Story, Kaphingst, Robinson-O'Brien, & Glanz, 2008). Concerns about sugar intake in human health dates from the 1970s where the onset of the obesity epidemic has been correlated with the sugar consumption (Kavey, 2010). Epidemiological studies have closely associated with sugar intake several chronic diseases through the development of obesity (Kavey, 2010; Reedy & Krebs-Smith, 2010). Health professionals recommend to reduce the caloric intake and increasing physical activity as a means to achieve sustainable weight loss (Patton, Hubrich, & O'Brien-Nabors, 2016). Alternatively, increasing the number of healthy food choices can be an effective strategy for promoting weight loss (Wing & Jeffery, 2001). There is a national urgency to reformulate energy-dense food products to make them healthier. Industrially processed food products are formulated with a variety of processing ingredients and aids to provide desirable texture, flavor, and shelf-life (Wahlgren, Bergenståhl, Nilsson, & Rayner, 2015). Though taste and convenience remain the top reasons for selecting a particular product, perceived health benefits are increasingly important for the consumer to choose a product over another. While the use of sucrose and sweeting syrups as a source of sweetness prevails in the manufacture of foodstuffs, many sugar replacers have been developed offering new opportunities for product development (Aidoo, Depypere, Afoakwa, & Dewettinck, 2013; Grembecka, 2015). Sugar replacers are classified as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners. Examples of nutritive sweeteners are sugar alcohols, including sorbitol, xylitol, isomalt, lactitol, and mannitol, while aspartame, saccharin, sucralose, stevia, and acesulfame-K are examples of non-nutritive sweeteners. The role of nutritive sweeteners in food formulations has been reviewed by Grembecka (2015). In today's supermarket, it is common to find food products formulated with nutritive sweeteners including drinks, chocolate, desserts, puddings, and others. Sugar alcohols or polyols are traditionally synthesized from corn syrup or cellulose biomass through a set of chemical reactions including oxidation, hydrolysis, and hydrogenation. Among sugar alcohols, lactitol is a versatile compound having diverse applications in the field of food, dairy, and pharmaceutical. In this review, we discuss key functional properties of lactitol and applications thereof. Section two provides an historical review of lactitol applications and developments. Section three deals with a brief introduction of lactitol production. Section four focused on key chemical and technological properties of lactitol including crystalline structure, sweetness and caloric value, and health benefits. Section five is a discussion of current and potential applications of lactitol for food and other fields."
1,Historical progress,"Table 1 provides a historical review of selected milestones for the lactitol industry. Lactitol was first reported almost 100 years ago by Senderens (1920), who hydrogenated lactose in the presence of active nickel. Soon after, it became clear that Senderens' process was not reliable since extensive hydrolysis of lactitol was observed. Further research in catalyst led to the invention of the sponge nickel, a catalytic preparation that facilitated the synthesis of sugar alcohols (Raney, 1925). Years later, the concept of lactitol as a low caloric ingredient was introduced by Karrer and Büchi (1937), who demonstrated that lactitol was minimally hydrolyzed by enzymes. Wolfrom, Burke, Brown, and Rose (1938) obtained anhydrous lactitol in crystalline form by purification and further crystallization of the hydrogenated slurry. In 1952, research in crystallization showed a second anhydrous crystalline form of lactitol, dihydrate, having different melting point than the monohydrate form (Wolfrom, Hann, & Hudson, 1952). Soon after, Kasehagen (1953) invented a process for the continuous production of sugar alcohols (sorbitol, mannitol, and lactitol) by direct hydrogenation of reducing sugars in the presence of solid catalyst. In the years thereafter, lactitol stimulated research in the field, nutrition, material science, and biotechnology. Fortification of infant food (Tervalon, 1963), synthesis of lactitol-based polyethers (Stockburger, Wright, & Brandner, 1966), sweeting agent (Hayashibara, 1976), animal feed (Harju, Setala, Heikonen, & Linko, 1988), and fermentation (Havenaar, Huis in ’t Veld, B., & de Stoppelaar, 1978) are remarkable examples of industrial applications of lactitol. The sweetness intensity of lactitol was demonstrated by Lee (1977), who developed a sweetness scale (relative sweetness intensity) using sucrose as a reference. For the first time, a numerical value was used to quantify the sweetness of lactitol and other sugar alcohols, leading to a hundreds of patents in subsequent years including confectionary formulations (Bunick, Hutchinson, & Cifrese, 1987), chewing gum (Yang, 1987), and low-calorie chocolate (Kong-Chan, 1988). The applicability of lactitol in the field of hygiene and medicine was demonstrated in the 1980's, where lactitol was successfully incorporated into toothpaste, mouthwashes and aseptic products for improving taste. Metabolic concerns related to lactitol consumption were first addressed by Wiel-Wetzels (1981). In years thereafter, lactitol enters in the field of medicine. For instance, it was used for the treatment of liver disease (Booij, 1983). In 1983, an expert committee of food additive approved lactitol as a safe product after years of safety studies in experimental animals (World Health Organization, 1983). In the early 1990's, Kivikoski, Pitkänen, Valkonen, and Heikkilä (1992) elucidated the different crystalline forms of lactitol and characterized their respective melting points. In 1993, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the status of Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by FDA (Food and Drug Administration, 1993). Soon after, the FDA regulated the labeling of lactitol and its health claims (Food and Drug Administration, 1996). More recently, lactitol was used in hair styling products due to its stability and hygroscopicity (Huynh, Hohenstein, & Santos, 2008). Wilson (2009) developed cleaning formulations using lactitol based surfactants. In nowadays, lactitol and other sugar alcohols represent a significant global market with various applications, and its production is projected to reach 1.9 million metric tons by 2022."
2,Lactitol production,"Lactitol is not found in nature and it is industrially produced through catalytic hydrogenation of lactose. Table 2 list the major industrial suppliers of lactitol. Catalytic hydrogenation refers to a set of chemical reactions in which hydrogen is added to a reactive functional group. In the case of lactose, the hydrogen is added to the carbonyl group of the glucose molecule. Fig. 1 illustrates the reactions involve in the production of lactitol. Overall, the reaction temperature is an important variable influencing the yield of catalytic hydrogenation of lactose. The reaction temperature ranged from 110 to 150 °C, while the pressure of hydrogen gas varied between 20 and 70 bars. The transition metals used as a catalyst are Ni, Pd, or Ru at a concentration from 1.5 to 10% supported in either carbon or alumina. These metals favor the dissociation of H2 molecules, which produces reactive hydrogen molecules. Such unstable species react with the carbonyl group of lactose when both are adsorbed at the surface of the supported catalyst. The primary reaction product is lactitol with reaction yields in the range of >90%, and a significant amount of lactulitol is also found, 1.7–1.9%. Lactitol may be hydrolyzed and further hydrogenated leading to the formation of sorbitol and galactitol (yield of 4.6–4.8%). Once the reaction is completed, the catalyst is separated by filtration, and the lactitol slurry is purified by ion-exchange resins. The purified slurry is evaporated to obtain lactitol syrup, which subsequently is crystallized, centrifuged and dried."
3,Properties,
4,Chemical and crystalline forms,"4.1 Chemical and crystalline forms Earlier observations by Wolfrom et al. (1938) and (1952) showed the existence of two forms of anhydrous lactitol having different melting points (monohydrate and dihydrate). Indeed, lactitol in solid state can exist in different crystalline forms. XRD and IR-spectra revealed three hydrate forms (mono-, di-, and tri-hydrate), two anhydrate (A and B), and one amorphous form (Kanters, Schouten, & van Bommel, 1990; Valkonen, Perkkalainen, Pitkänen, & Rautiainen, 1994; Yajima, Okahira, & Hoshino, 1997). Table 3 summarizes the X-ray diffraction peaks and endothermic peaks of four solids forms of lactitol. The most common form of lactitol is monohydrate, which is obtained through slow crystallization of the lactitol slurry. Lactitol is a monoclinic polyol with one intra- and eight inter-molecular hydrogen bonds in its chemical structure (Kivikoski et al., 1992a,b,c). All hydroxyl H-atoms form hydrogen bonds, which give rise to an eight membered ring, chair conformation of the galactopyranosyl ring. Yajima et al. (1997) reported a melting point of around 98 °C for lactitol monohydrate. Similarly, Halttunen, Rajakylä, Nurmi, Perkkalainen, and Pitkänen (2001) evaluated the melting point of lactitol monohydrate using DSC. The melting point was found to be within the range of 93–100 °C, depending on the grinding and drying of the lactitol monohydrate. The crystalline form of lactitol dihydrate is tetragonal with three intra- and twelve inter-molecular hydrogen bonds in its chemical structure (Kivikoski, Valkonen, & Nurmi, 1992a,c). Similar to lactitol monohydrate, all hydroxyl H-atoms form hydrogen bonds resulting in a chair configuration of the galactopyranosyl ring. Halttunen, Nurmi, Perkkalainen, Pitkanen, and Raisanen (1997) evaluated the effect of water content on the crystal structure of lactitol monohydrate. It was found that over 23% of the water content can be removed from the crystal structure by slow drying without significant structural changes. Contrary, during rapid drying of crystalline lactitol monohydrate, a third form of anhydrous can be formed, namely trihydrate lactitol. The crystalline structure of lactitol trihydrate is orthorhombic with one intra- and thirteen inter-molecular hydrogen bonds (Kivikoski et al., 1992a,b,c). Upon heating, the trihydrate form undergoes phase transformation into anhydrate A (85 °C) and anhydrate B (105 °C). The melting point of the two polymorphic forms is within the range of 120–124 and 150–151 °C, respectively (Table 3). Yajima et al. (1997) investigated the transformation of solid forms of lactitol using XRD, IR spectra, and DSC. Fig. 2 illustrates the interconversion path of five solid forms. Lactitol monohydrate can be converted into anhydrate A upon heating at 80 °C, which subsequently converts into deliquescence state at a relative humidity of 93%, path I. Anhydrate A may convert back into monohydrate within the range of relative humidity of 22–90%. Additionally, lactitol monohydrate may convert directly to deliquescence state at a relative humidity of 93%, path II. Anhydrate B is formed by heating monohydrate at temperatures around 105 °C, which further be converted into deliquescence state at a high relative humidity of 93%. Anhydrate B converts back to monohydrate at a relative humidity range of 75–90%. The conversion of anhydrate B is illustrated in path III. Lactitol dihydrate is formed either from monohydrate or amorphous at a relative humidity of 90%. Interestingly, dihydrate does not convert directly into deliquescence state instead; it is converted into anhydrate B, path IV. The amorphous form of lactitol may convert into deliquescence state, dihydrate, and monohydrate when the relative humidity is around 93, 90 and 53–84%, respectively (path V). Halttunen, Hurtta, Pitkänen, and Nurmi (2005) studied the phase transitions of lactitol through sorption and desorption using humidity chambers prepared with aqueous solutions of salt. Lactitol monohydrate was more stable towards moisture than dihydrate and trihydrate. Thermogravimetric analysis (weigh loss upon heating) revealed that the monohydrate form does not evaporate water easily, while dehydrate partly eliminates water changing into an amorphous form. On the other hand, lactitol trihydrate easily loses part of its crystal water and converts into lactitol dihydrate."
5,Solubility,"4.2 Solubility Methods for commercial preparation of lactitol has been a topic of interest in years past. Lactitol is available as a crystalline powder, and its properties and potential application strongly depend of the given crystalline form. After hydrogenation, the catalyst is removed through ion-exchange followed by evaporation under vacuum, crystallization under prescribed protocol, centrifugation and drying. During the crystallization step, a specific crystal form can be favored other another. General guidelines of crystallization of carbohydrates are applicable for lactitol. However, it is worth to mention that little is known in relation to nucleation of lactitol. Nevertheless, the work described by Nurmi and Kaira (2002) is the best guide available in the literature for the crystallization of lactitol. Fig. 3 shows the solubility curves of the different crystalline forms of lactitol. From a practical point of view, the solubility curve of lactitol was arbitrarily divided into regions I to IV. Region IV represents the crystallization conditions yielding anhydrous lactitol. Nurmi and Kaira (2002) obtained lactitol in anhydrous form by crystallizing a 91% solution of lactitol. The mass was crystallized by cooling the solution from 95 to 75 °C for more than 10 h. Similarly, Heikkila, Nurmi, and Pepper (1998) crystallized lactitol anhydrous by cooling (90–80 °C) of a concentrated lactitol solution (90%). Region II illustrates the working conditions for obtaining lactitol monohydrate. This has been exemplified by Heikkilä et al. (2002), who performed a four-step crystallization to obtain lactitol monohydrate. The protocol consisted of cooling from 70 to 40 °C in 16 h a seeded lactitol solution (82%). Wijnman, Van Velthuijsen, and Van Den Berg (1998) obtained lactitol monohydrate through seeding an aqueous solution of lactitol (80%) and crystallized it from 75 to 50 °C in 18 h. The remaining mother liquid from the lactitol monohydrate was seeded and further cooled down to 18-15 °C in order to produce lactitol dihydrate (region II in Fig. 3). Wijnman et al. (1998) followed a similar protocol and reported a 60% yield of lactitol dihydrate. Lactitol trihydrate (region I) is obtained by further crystallization of the mother liquid at temperatures lower than 10 °C (Nurmi & Kaira, 2002)."
6,Caloric value,"4.3 Caloric value Evidence of reduced calorie value of lactitol dates back to 1930's, where the enzymatic hydrolysis of lactitol was found to be significantly slower than that of lactose, suggesting that lactitol is minimally absorbed in the intestine (Karrer & Büchi, 1937). This observation pointed out the possibility of reduced calorie effect of lactitol. Indeed, Hayashibara (1976) injected a 20% solution of lactitol in rabbits and measured the concentration of lactitol left in the intestines after several hours. Interestingly, the concentration of lactitol was unchanged while 85% of the glucose (control treatment) was lost due to digestion. Van Es, De Groot, and Vogt (1986) analyzed the metabolized energy derived from lactitol and sucrose and found that the energy contribution to the body was 60% less than for sucrose. European labeling considers a blanket caloric value of lactitol as 2.4 kcal g−1 (Radeloff & Beck, 2013), while the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows a value of 2.0 kcal g−1, which correspond to a reduction of 48-40% with respect to sucrose."
7,Sweetness,"4.4 Sweetness Lactitol has been described as a crystalline powder having a mild clean sweet taste (Zacharis & Stowell, 2011). Relative sweetness is measured in relation to a reference value of 1, which correspond to the sucrose sweetness at a given concentration (Radeloff & Beck, 2013). The relative sweetness of lactitol varies from 0.3 to 0.42, increasing with concentration from 10 to 20% (w/w). For practical reasons, the sweetness of lactitol is often considered to be around 30–35% compared to that of sucrose. Consequently, replacing sucrose with lactitol in equal sweetness value would require a substantial amount of lactitol. Thus, lactitol is combined with high-intensity sweeteners to effectively reduce the sucrose concentration."
8,Health claims,"4.5 Health claims Although sugar alcohols are not essential nutrients, its consumption has been clinically linked to numerous health claims. A comprehensive review of the health claims of sugar alcohols can be found elsewhere (Livesey, 2003; Nath et al., 2017). In general, sugar alcohols are a poor source of energy for oral bacteria as opposed to other sugars (sucrose and starches), resulting in less acid production. This has been exemplified by van der Hoeven (1986) who studied the cariogenicity of lactitol in program-fed rats and observed that replacing sucrose with lactitol significantly reduced caries increment. This observation was supported by the fermentation rates of oral bacteria, where the acid production from lactitol occurred at much lower rate than the acid production from sucrose. Clinical evidence showed that substitution of sucrose with sugar alcohols in chewing gum and candies reduce the incidence of caries. van Loveren (2004) suggested that caries-preventive effects of gums and candies formulated with sugar alcohols are due to a stimulation of the salivary flow, which provides buffer capacity to wash away soluble carbohydrates. However, there is no evidence for a minimal dose required to effectively reduced caries. Nevertheless, van Loveren (2004) concluded that chewing of sugar-free chewing gum for three or more times daily may reduce caries incidence irrespective of the type of sugar alcohol added. Lactitol is one of the most frequently prescribed laxative agents to treat chronic constipation (Prasad & Abraham, 2017). As a laxative agent, lactitol is minimally absorbed in the small intestine, and when it reaches the large intestine, it creates an osmotic gradient that increases the water retention in the stool, enhancing its passage. Miller, Tennilä, and Ouwehand (2014) performed a meta-analysis on the efficacy and tolerance of lactitol for adult constipation. It was found that lactitol supplementation not only was well tolerated but also significantly improves symptoms of constipation."
9,Bioavailability,"4.6 Bioavailability In the absence of scientific evidence of lactitol bioavailability, it is though that lacitol follows similar mechanisms of bioavailability than that of other prebiotics such as lactulose. As a prebiotic, lactitol is poorly bioavailable with laxative properties and the ability to acidify the intestine, suppressing ammonia absorption (Iwasa & Takei, 2015). Lactitol is a stable molecule that can be used to increase the bioavailability of other compounds. Krupaa et al. (2017) increased the oral bioavailability of a hot-melt extruder containing tadalafil, a poorly soluble drug, by adding lactitol as a crystalline carrier. Covalent conjugation of bioactive molecules with polyethylene glycol has shown to be a promising strategy for increasing their bioavailability in therapeutic applications (Giorgi, Ratier, Agusti, Frasch, & de Lederkremer, 2012). The chemical properties of polyethylene glycol (solubility, compatibility, and lack of toxicity) allowed to extend the half-life of some proteins. Giorgi, Ratier, Agusti, Frasch, and de Lederkremer (2010) studied the bioavailability of conjugated polyethylene glycol with lactitol and benzyl β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 6)-2-amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside. The presence of lactitol provided a stable amino-bond between polyethylene glycol and the bioactive molecule."
10,Applications,
11,Cryoprotectant and dryoprotectant,"5.1 Cryoprotectant and dryoprotectant Table 4 summarizes investigation where lactitol was used as a cryoprectant. Lactitol is a polyol with the ability to prevent physical and chemical degradation of protein preparations during processing (frozen and drying) and subsequent storage. An investigation on the effectiveness of lactitol as a cryoprotectant agent for myofibrillar proteins of fish muscle (rainbow trout) showed that addition of lactitol preserved the structural stability of myosin (Herrera & Mackie, 2004). Additionally, lactitol reduced the kinetic of hydrophobic residues over the protein surface. Similarly, Nopianti, Huda, Noryati, Fazilah, and Easa (2012) evaluated the effect of adding lactitol on protein denaturation of threadfin bream surimi during 6 months of frozen storage. It was found that a formulation containing 6% of lactitol yielded comparable protective effect with that obtained for polydextrose and sorbitol. Ramadhan, Huda, and Ahmad (2012) evaluated the cryoprotective effect of lactitol on duck surimi after five cycles of freeze-thaw during 4-month of frozen storage. These authors reported that 6% (w/w) of lactitol yielded higher protein solubility and gel firmness when compared with the control treatment. More importantly, lactitol yielded comparable protective parameters with those obtained for other cryoprotectants such as polydextrose, trehalose, and palatinit. The cryoprotectant ability of lactitol has also been evaluated in combination with other compounds. Sultanbawa and Li-Chan (1998) used blends of cryoprotectant (sorbitol, lactitol, polyphosphate, and Litesse™) to prevent protein damage during frozen storage of ling cod surimi. A blend of 4% made of sucrose, sorbitol, Litesse™, and lactitol (ratio 1:1:1:1) was found to stabilize surimi during frozen at −18 °C and storage for 4 months. Similarly, Sultanbawa and Li-Chan (2001) evaluated individual and blends of cryoprotectants during frozen-stored surimi from ling cod (Ophiodon elongatus). The optimized blends effectively prevented loss of gelling capacity after 8 freeze-thaw cycles. As a cryoprotectant agent, lactitol forms glassy matrix that immobilizes the protein system and preventing unfolding. It is also though that lactitol forms hydrogen bonds with the protein structure, which helps preserving the activity of enzymes. Interestingly, the postulated mechanisms are also valid for drying of protein preparations. This has been exemplified by Santana, Zilda, and Huda (2017), who evaluated the effect of adding lactitol (5%) during the freeze-drying of threadfin bream surimi. It was found that lactitol not only prevented protein denaturation during freeze-drying but also performed comparable with other dryoprotectant agents (sorbitol and maltodextrin) in terms of physiochemical parameters (whiteness, gel formation, and foaming). Kadoya et al. (2010) used lactitol monohydrate as a cryoprotective agent during the freeze-drying of buffer solutions of L-lactic deydrogenase and bovine serum albumin. Microscopic observation under vacuum revealed that lactitol forms hydrogen bonds that substitute water molecules, which maintains the activity of L-lactic dehydrogenase and preserves the structure of bovine albumin serum during freeze-drying and subsequent storage. Preserving the activity and structure of proteins is an essential characteristic for pharmaceutical applications that helps minimizing product immunogenicity. Lactitol has been used to preserved archeological artifacts. An investigation on the stability of waterlogged archeological wood showed that the impregnation of lactitol before freeze-drying resulted in better hygroscopic properties compared with polyethylene glycol impregnation (Majka, Babiński, & Olek, 2017). Similarly, Babiński (2015) evaluated changes in dimensions and moisture content of waterlogged archeological oak treated with lactitol. It was found that the application of lactitol significantly reduced the shrinkage of the wood. Lactitol can partially replace water molecules and fill the cell walls and lumen, reducing contraction and deformation upon drying."
12,Surfactant and hydrogel,"5.2 Surfactant and hydrogel Lactitol is chemically more stable than related disaccharides, lactose and sucrose. The stability of lactitol arises from its chemical structure, where the absence of a carbonyl group provides stability within a broad range of pH (3–9). Another important characteristic derived from its chemical structure is that lactitol is not a reducing sugar, meaning that does not participate in Maillard reactions. These properties of lactitol have opened a window for non-conventional applications, including the synthesis of surfactants, emulsifiers, and hydrogels. Table 5 exemplifies studies on the use of lactitol for the synthesis of surfactants, emulsifiers, and hydrogels. Van Velthuijsen (1979) synthesized a non-ionic lactitol based emulsifier by direct esterification with palmitic acid under alkaline conditions. Mono- and higher lactitol fatty esters showed detergent activity through removing soil and stains from kitchen towels. Dupuy et al. (1998) evaluated the micellization in water of lactitol-based surfactants. These authors found that lactiol surfactants were weakly dispersed at low concentration. Furthermore, the formed micelles were schematized by oblate ellipsoids due to their stearic hindrance. Similarly, Drummond and Wells (1998) synthesized mono-esters of lactitol of different chain length, octyl (C8), dodecyl (C12) and hexadecyl (C16). These surfactants were evaluated for their interfacial tension in contact with hexadecane and triolin. Above the critical micelle concentration, increasing chain surfactant slightly lower the interfacial tension than their shorter chain homologous. Additionally, lactitol surfactants showed the ability to form stable foam over 30 min. Such properties are important indicators suggesting that lactitol based surfactants have the potential to be used as emulsifiers. Although surfactants derived from lactitol have shown promising properties, no commercial application has been developed. Edible and renewable disaccharides have been used as building blocks for the production of polymers and hydrogels. This has been illustrated by Wilson, Hu, Kurth, Hsieh, and Krochta (1996), who synthesized and characterized polyether polyols by propoxylation of lactitol under alkaline conditions. The physical characteristics of lactitol polyether polyols showed similar viscosity and hygroscopicity as their analogous sucrose-based polyether polyols of the same hydroxyl number. Interestingly, shorter reaction times were required than the sucrose-based polyols. More importantly, the decomposition of lactitol, as well as the formation of browning compounds, were negligible. Wilson et al. (1996) used the lactiol polyether polyols as building blocks to prepare rigid polyurethane foams. Such rigid polyurethane foams showed comparable physical properties than that of commercial foams. Hu et al. (1997) synthesized polyurethane foams by propoxylation of hydrogenated sweet whey permeate. The resulting foams were evaluated showing low densities, high closed cell contents, strong mechanical properties, and high thermal stability. Similarly, Lin, Hu, Hsieh, Kurth, and Krochta (1998) modulated the propoxylation of lactitol to yield polyether polyols having up to nine polypropylene oxide branches. Ring opening polymerization of propylene oxide initiated by the hydroxyl group of lactitol was proposed as a reaction mechanism. The resulting lactitol polyether polyols were further used to generate hydrogel by reacting acylated polyethylene glycol bis carboxymethyl ether. The lactitol hydrogels showed the ability to absorb water up to 1000% of their dry weight. Remarkably, these hydrogels expelled free water at a temperature above 30 °C. As a platform chemical, lactitol has also been used to engineer delivery systems for bioactive compounds. Han, Krochta, Kurth, and Hsieh (2000b) synthesized poly(ether polyol) hydrogel using lactitol as a platform chemical. These authors evaluated the drug release ability of such hydrogel using acetylsalicylic acid over a pH range of 4–9, and it was found that the release rate can be controlled by the degree of crosslinking of the hydrogel. Han, Krochta, Hsieh, and Kurth (2000a) incorporated model protein into the lactitol based cross-linked hydrogel and evaluated the release of them into the surrounding fluid. These authors found that the release rate of β-lactoglobulin, bovine serum albumin, and γ-globulin was constant over 2 h at a temperature range of 37–45 °C. Such a constant release rate approaching the human body temperature is of high relevance for drug delivery in clinical applications. Chacon, Hsieh, Kurth, and Krochta (2000) synthesized lactitol hydrogels with swelling capacity up to 81-fold. The swelling capacity was controlled by the length of polypropylene oxide branches and the extend of crosslinking. The space between the polypropylene oxide branches within the lactitol governs the free volume available to bind water and subsequently swell. The relative high swelling behavior of lactitol hydrogels makes them promising candidates for controlled release systems. Indeed, Chacon et al. (2000) incorporated lipase into the lactitol hydrogel structure and evaluated its release as a function of temperature. It was found that over 90% of the enzyme was released during the first hour when the temperature raised between 25 and 40 °C. Another investigation used lactitol as a target group during the synthesis of a novel drug delivery (Luo et al., 2016). The resulting carrier was incorporated in docetaxel liposomes to improve the cure rate of liver disease."
13,Bakery,"5.3 Bakery Table 6 illustrates investigation on the use of lactitol in bakery products. Reducing or replacing sugar in bakery formulations is not a trivial task since sugar plays a major role in the rheological properties of the batter/dough and therefore on the final quality of the product. This has been illustrated by Psimouli and Oreopoulou (2012), who used lactitol as a sugar replacer in cake formulations. It was found that replacing sugar with lactitol in equal amount (900 g kg−1) resulted in a batter of comparable flow index and temperature of starch gelatinization. More importantly, the sensory analysis showed no significant difference between the batter formulated with lactitol and the one formulated with sugar. Frye and Setser (1992) used lactitol as a sweetener to optimize cake formulations with approximately 45% calorie reduction having comparable attributes with a standard yellow layer cake. Zoulias, Oreopoulou, and Kounalaki (2002) investigated the effect of lactitol and other polyols as a sucrose replacement on the texture profile of cookie dough. The dough formulated with lactitol and maltitol yielded medium values of hardness and consistency, and relatively high values of adhesiveness and cohesiveness. Such texture attributes are similar to those obtained from cookie dough formulated with sucrose. Similarly, Zoulias et al. (2002) formulated fat-free and sugar-free cookies without significant changes in hardness and brittleness using lactitol combined with sorbitol and maltitol."
14,Chocolate and confectionary,"5.4 Chocolate and confectionary The development of sugar-free chocolate is a significant challenge since all the sugar needs to be replaced, which changes the rheological and melting properties of the final product. General guidelines for manufacturing sugar-free chocolates can be found elsewhere (Aidoo et al., 2013). Table 7 summarizes studies on the use of lactitol for formulating cholate and confectionary products. Mentink and Serpelloni (1994) developed a formulation for low-calorie chocolate containing an equimolar blend of maltitol, lactitol, and isomaltulose. The resulting chocolate showed technical and organoleptic properties comparable to those of traditional sucrose-containing chocolate. Synergistic effects have been observed when combining sugar alcohols with other sweeteners. de Melo, Bolini, and Efraim (2009) formulated a sugar-free chocolate with an acceptable sensory profile by combining high-intensity sweeteners with blends of polydextrose/lactitol (60/40% w/w). Similarly, Belščak-Cvitanović et al. (2015) compared the use of sugar alcohols, syrups, and natural sweeteners as a sucrose alternative in the production of reduced sugar chocolates. Combination of lactitol and fructose yielded a reduction of 20% in the caloric value than sucrose formulated chocolate. The relatively large particles of bulk lactitol resulted in a two-fold increase in the hardness. Another relevant application of sugar alcohols as sugar replacers is during the manufacture of hard-boiled sweets. Lactitol, sorbitol and others polyols are hygroscopic in nature resulting in sticky texture. This technological challenge has limited the applicability of sugar alcohols for manufacturing hard-boiled sweets and coating applications. Serpelloni and Ribadeau-Dumas (1995) improved the process of hard coating using a syrup of polyols (sorbitol, malitol, mannitol, xylitol, lactitol, and isomalt) and pulverized powder of polyols. The process reduces the number of coating cycles, while providing the desirable organoleptic characteristics. Another investigation on the effect of substituting sugar in confectionary syrups showed up to 40% of the sugar content was replaced with lactitol without significant changes in the moisture content and density of the syrup (Onwulat, Konstance, & Holsinger, 2000). On the other hand, the addition of lactiol resulted in a two-fold increase in the viscosity of the syrup. Blankers, Evers, Putker, and Terlouw (2002) formulated a syrup sweeting suitable for soft confectionary applications. The syrup is made of lactitol and polydextrose and it is combined with the lactitol slurry derived from lactose hydrogenation. Bunick et al. (1987) formulated a sugarless nougat-type confection with desirable mouthfeel by replacing hard-boiled corn syrup with hydrogenated starch and mixtures of sugar alcohols (xylitol, mannitol, sorbitol, galactitol, and lactitol)."
15,Desserts,"5.5 Desserts Attempts to formulate dessert products with reduced sugar using lactitol have been investigating. Gurditta, Patel, and Arora (2014) evaluated the effect of replacing sugar in Chhana-murki, a dairy dessert from India, by using blends of isomalt and lactitol. These authors found that a formulation containing up to 15% (w/w) of polyol blend yielded desirable color, appearance, sweetness, and overall acceptance. Santos and Silva (2012) evaluated the physical and chemical properties of reduced sugar ice-cream using lactitol and Splenda as a sugar replacement. A 50% reduction in the caloric content was obtained by a combination of lactitol and Splenda. However, the apparent viscosity and the ability to incorporate air were adversely affected."
16,Chewing gum,"5.6 Chewing gum Lactitol in combination with other sugar alcohols are used to formulate sugar-free chewing gum. The higroscopicity of lactitol is relatively low, which facilities its incorporation into the gum base. This has been illustrated by Huzinec, Kearns, and Schindeldecker (1999) who incorporated flavor and sweetness compounds including lactitol into a carrier made of microcrystalline cellulose. Such blend extended the release of flavor and sweetness in chewing gums. McGrew et al. (2005) combined active compounds with bulk sweeteners (mannitol, xylitol, maltitol, lactitol, and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates) to develop a controlled release of an active agent embedded within a chewing gum base. Similarly, Yatka, Richey, and Meyers (1995) formulated a generic chewing gum base containing oligofructose and sugar alcohols (sorbitol, maltitol, xylitol, lactitol, and mannitol) as bulking agents. This generic formulation was blended with glycerol and evaporated to produce a low-moisture and sugar-free chewing gum. The combination of oligofructose and sugar alcohols improved texture, moisture adsorption, and shelf-life compared with conventional sugar-based formulation. Reed, Hook, and Schnell (1994) formulated a hard coated chewing gum using a coating layer made of lactitol, maltitol, and sorbitol. The wet syrup was used to cover the gum base, and further dried with air until reaching a final moisture content of 8%. The coated mixture improved the stability during prolonged storage. Similarly, Reed et al. (1997) formulated pellets of chewing gum successively coated with syrups of lactitol, maltitol, and isomaltulose. Such coating process improved the quality and stability of hard coated pellets. Schobel and Yang (1989) encapsulated sweeting agents (lactitol, mannose, fructose, and aspartame) with carboxymethyl cellulose. The encapsulated sweeting agents were further incorporated into the gum base, which provides prolonged release of sweetness."
17,Biosensor development,"5.7 Biosensor development Lactitol is used as additive for the development of biosensors due to its ability to stabilize enzymes during production and storage. Karamitros and Labrou (2017) immobilized isoenzyme glutathione transferase in the presence of lactitol. It was found that 5% of lactitol led to prolonged stability of the enzyme activity. Similarly, Gibson and Woodward (1993) used combinations of diethylaminoethyl-dextran hydrochloride (DEAE-Dextran) and lactitol to stabilize enzymes in dry state. It was found that the combination of DEAE-Dextran (10%) and lactitol (5%) preserved 95% of the enzymatic activity after 16 d. Zhybak et al. (2016) used lactitol as stabilizer during the immobilization of creatinine deaminase and urease and reported significant improvement in the stability of the biosensor. More importantly, the selectivity of the biosensor was not impacted by the addition of lactitol. The ability of lactitol to stabilize enzymes has attracted the attention of researchers for prolonging the stability of immobilized enzymes, and therefore development of improved biosensors."
18,Stabilizer agent,"5.8 Stabilizer agent As discussed earlier, the absence of a carbonyl group within the lactitol structure provides stability within a broad range of conditions. This characteristic has been explored by Klewicki (2007) who evaluated the hydrolysis of juices during pasteurization and found that only 3% of the oligosaccharides were hydrolyzed in the presence of lactitol. Similarly, the addition of lactitol showed a protective effect on the activity of α-amylase during heating (Samborska, Guiavarc'h, Van Loey, & Hendrickx, 2006). Ma, Lee, and Kwong (2002) evaluated the transesterification of lactitol and methylparaben, an antimicrobial, to enhance its solubility and incorporation within the excipient. The trans esterification of lactitol minimized the formation of byproducts compared with the transesterification of sugars."
19,Opportunities and future challenges,"Nutritive sweeteners or sugar alcohols are increasingly used in many food and pharmaceutical applications due to their functional properties and health benefits. An overview of the industrial application of sugar alcohols as sweeteners is reviewed by Grembecka (2015). Although the functional properties of lactitol provided by Zacharis and Stowell (2011), a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of lactitol physical properties has not been reported. Research strategies for expanding the applicability of lactitol are needed including, solubility at different conditions, rheological behavior, heat stability, thermogravimetric analysis, stability toward heat and pH, particle size, bulk and particle density, and crystallization kinetics."
20,Conclusions,"In this review, we have provided an overview of the state of art in the knowledge of properties and applications of lactitol. Lactitol is not found in nature and it can only be produced via catalytic hydrogenation of lactose. Chemically, it is a sugar alcohol that can exist in different crystalline forms. Lactitol is a versatile ingredient that can be employed by product developers not only to deliver sweetness at low caloric value but also to assist food formulation as a bulking agent, humectant, cryoprotectant, and prebiotic source. Lactitol is a suitable molecule for the use as a carrier of a variety of drugs for enhanced bioavailability. Lactitol has also shown potential to be used for the synthesis of surfactants, emulsifiers, polymers, and hydrogels. Research efforts are necessary to understand the chemistry behind the applications of lactitol as well as a comprehensive evaluation of the final product properties."
