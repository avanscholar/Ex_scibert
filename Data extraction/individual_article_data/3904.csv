0,Introduction,"In the last decade, research in biopolymers has been widely carried out to design and develop renewable, biodegradable and biocompatible products with applications in medicine, pharmacy, cosmetics, food industry and biotechnology (Hu, Chen, Yang, Li, & Wang, 2014). Among biopolymers, cellulose is the most abundant natural compound on the earth. This low-cost biopolymer has renewability, non-toxicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability and chemical stability (Cazón, Velazquez, Ramírez, & Vázquez, 2017). Due to the properties of cellulose, it has become a very interesting material to develop new biodegradable polymers, like biofilms aimed to food packaging applications. Cellulose is a highly crystalline polymer formed by a linear chain with two anhydroglucose rings ((C6H10O5) n ), covalently linked through an oxygen in a β(1–4) glycosidic bond. Cellulose possesses abundant hydroxyl groups forming plenty inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds (Cazón et al., 2017). It is found in plant cell wall and accordingly, it can be obtained from wood, cotton, hemp and plant-based materials. Furthermore, cellulose is also produced by tunicates, several species of algae, and by some species of bacteria including Acetobacter, Agrobacterium, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Sarcina and Komagataeibacter xylinus. The last one was renamed as Acetobacter xylinum and more widespread as Gluconoacetobacter xylinus (Szymańska-Chargot et al., 2017; Yamada et al., 2012). It produces high amounts of cellulose, being one of the most commonly studied sources of bacterial cellulose (BC) (Mohammadkazemi, Azin, & Ashori, 2015; Ruka, Simon, & Dean, 2012). In a suitable culture medium and static conditions, G. xylinus synthesizes BC in the form of pellicle on the surface of the liquid medium. This microorganism produces glucose chains from the carbon source contained in the medium. The glucose chains are extruded out through tiny pores present on their cell wall. Combining the glucose chains, the microorganism forms microfibrils that aggregate to form cellulose ribbons. These ribbons form a three-dimensional structure consisting of an ultrafine network of cellulose nanofibers with an expanded surface area and high porosity. The three-dimensional structure determines its physical and mechanical properties (Jozala et al., 2016; Shah, Ul-Islam, Khattak, & Park, 2013; Shao et al., 2016). Unlike vegetable cellulose, BC is obtained with high purity, free of vegetable remains such as lignin and hemicellulose (Jozala et al., 2016). Several studies have been focused on developing new films based on BC. Usually, BC films are combined with other polymers or plasticizers to improve or modify the physicochemical properties and expand its potential applications. There are two main strategies to combine BC with other polymers or plasticizers, keeping the film structure obtained from the fermentation process. One option is by supplementation of the culture medium with the desirable reinforcing agents, such as Aloe vera (Saibuatong & Phisalaphong, 2010), chitosan (Phisalaphong & Jatupaiboon, 2008), polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) (Gea, Bilotti, Reynolds, Soykeabkeaw, & Peijs, 2010) or polyethylene oxide (Brown & Laborie, 2007). Other strategy is by immersion of the BC film in a bath with a solution of the desirable polymer or plasticizer, e.g. polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) (Gea et al., 2010), polyethylene glycol or diacrylate (Cai & Kim, 2010; Numata, Sakata, Furukawa, & Tajima, 2015). A widespread practice is to use nanofibers or nanowhiskers of BC as a reinforcing agent. BC pellicles are usually subjected to a hydrolysis process using strong acids, breaking down the structure of the material into nanofibers or nanocrystals (Martínez-Sanz, Lopez-Rubio, & Lagaron, 2013). These BC nanocomponents are incorporated into the matrix of a polymer to modify the properties of the composite film such as starch (Martins et al., 2009), PVOH (Jipa et al., 2012), arabinogalactan and xyloglucan (Lucyszyn et al., 2016), chitosan (Salari, Sowti Khiabani, Rezaei Mokarram, Ghanbarzadeh, & Samadi Kafil, 2018; Velásquez-Cock et al., 2014; Wang, Xie, et al. 2018), polylactic acid, polyethylene glycol (Martínez-Sanz et al., 2013), fish proteins (Shabanpour, Kazemi, Ojagh, & Pourashouri, 2018), gelatin (George & Siddaramaiah, 2012) or agar (Wang, Guo, et al. 2018) among other biopolymers. From the strategies mentioned to obtain BC-polymers composite films, it is interesting to pay special attention to the immersion method. It is a simple technique that allows using the films formed from the culture medium. This method allows avoiding previous steps of dissolution, regeneration or homogeneous dispersion of the cellulose, simplifying the process. In addition, this technique allows taking advantage of the unique structure of the BC as the main component of the final matrix. On the other hand, unlike the supplementation culture media method, by immersion allows expanding the range and concentration of the possible combinations. Some supplementation components in the culture media can interfere with the cellulose production yield. Hence, the concentration of these components in the formulation film are limited (Phisalaphong & Jatupaiboon, 2008; Saibuatong & Phisalaphong, 2010). Following the strategy of combining polymers to improve the properties of the final material, PVOH and chitosan can improve the potential applications of BC-based films. PVOH is a hydrophilic semi-crystalline polymer produced by polymerization of vinyl acetate to polyvinyl acetate, followed by a hydrolysis process. It is a synthetic polymer, water soluble, non-toxic, biodegradable, with film forming properties, optimal transparency and good elasticity properties (Carvalho et al., 2009; Cazón, Vázquez, & Velazquez, 2018a). These properties make PVOH an ideal polymer to combine with BC by immersion. Chitosan is one of the most studied polysaccharides with potential applications in biomedical, food, and chemical industries. It is the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature. It can be obtained mainly from residues of the shellfish industry. This polymer is non-toxic, biodegradable, with film forming properties and soluble in dilute organic acids such as acetic acid. One of the most interesting properties of the chitosan is its antimicrobial activity against a wide range of foodborne filamentous fungi, yeast, and bacteria, being more active against yeasts (Helander, Nurmiaho-Lassila, Ahvenainen, Rhoades, & Roller, 2001; No, Meyers, Prinyawiwatkul, & Xu, 2007). Among these properties, its solubility and antimicrobial activity make it an ideal polymer to combine with BC by immersion. Incorporating antimicrobial agents from natural source into BC composite films addresses the current consumer demand of a natural alternative to chemically synthesized antimicrobial polymers. In food packaging, a strategy to increase the shelf life is to develop active films with antimicrobial properties. The direct contact with the active films inhibit the growth of microorganisms on the surface of the food (Broek Van Den, Knoop, Kappen, & Boeriu, 2015; Moreira, del, Roura, & Ponce, 2011). In previous studies of our group, films based on regenerated vegetable cellulose-PVOH-chitosan were characterized. The results obtained suggested an adequate interaction of cellulose-chitosan-PVOH to combine both polymers by immersion, improving the film properties (Cazón et al., 2018a; Cazón, Vázquez, & Velazquez, 2018b). Nevertheless, as mentioned, there are important structural differences between vegetable cellulose and BC. These differences could affect the interactions of cellulose-PVOH-chitosan, improving the properties of the cellulose-based films and expanding its potential applications. Besides, it was observed the low transmittance of regenerated cellulose and chitosan films developed, manifesting UV protect properties of cellulose-based films (Cazón et al., 2018a). Packaging materials against UV light has received a great deal of attention since UV-light is one of those responsible factors of the oxidative process in vitamins, lipids and proteins. These oxidative process produce undesirable off-flavours that decrease the shelf-life of the products (Olarte, Sanz, Federico Echávarri, & Ayala, 2009). Hence, the UV-barrier properties observed increase the interest in the development of BC-based films for food applications. On the other hand, the application of BC-PVOH-chitosan components in the field of controlled drug administration has been also studied. The results suggested that BC-PVOH-chitosan composites could be used as a biopolymeric carrier for drug delivery applications (Pavaloiu, Dobre, & Hlevca, 2013). Despite the good interaction among these biodegradable polymers, the characterization of these films has not been carried out to aim applications like biopolymers for active food packaging. The aim of this work was to develop biodegradable films based on BC with chitosan and PVOH to enhance the mechanical and optical properties to obtain cellulose films more manageable and transparent with antimicrobial and UV-barrier properties. The effect of the ratio of these polymers incorporated to the BC matrix by immersion, maintaining intact the characteristic BC structure, was studied and compared to regenerated cellulose, previously analyzed. Polynomial models were used to evaluate the effect of the composition of the blend on the moisture content, mechanical properties (tensile strength, percentage of elongation to break and Young's Modulus) and water vapour permeability. Besides, microstructure, optical properties, structure and thermal analyses of the BC-PVOH-chitosan films were also evaluated."
1,Materials and methods,"Komagateibacter xylinus was obtained from the “Colección Española de Cultivos Tipo” (CECT, Valencia, Spain). Extra pure anhydrous sodium bromide (99%), sodium hydroxide (98%) and D(+)-glucose monohydrate (99% extra pure) were purchased from Acros organics (Geel, Belgium). Yeast extract was provided by Scharlau Microbiology (Barcelona, Spain). Full-hydrolyzed (>98%) polyvinyl alcohol with average molecular weight (Mw) of 30,000 g/mol and ester value of 12–25 were supplied by Merck (Billerica, MA, US). Chitosan (Mw 100,000–300,000) was purchased from Acros organics (Geel, Belgium)."
2,Preparation of bacterial cellulose films,"2.1 Preparation of bacterial cellulose films The preparation process is shown in Fig. 1 . Initial culture medium was prepared from 10% of glucose and 1% of yeast extract and sterilized at 121 °C for 15 min. A pre-culture was prepared by transferring 5 ml of a stock culture to 300 ml of medium in a Petri dish and incubated statically at 30 °C for 2 days. Then, Petri dishes were prepared with 75 ml of culture medium and inoculated with 5 ml of the pre-culture. Petri dish was stored at 30 °C for 8 days. After that time, the film was suspended in the air-liquid medium. The films were treated with 1% (w/v) of NaOH at 90 °C for 1 h to remove bacterial cells and washed with running distilled water until pH 7. Finally, BC films were dried at room temperature for 48 h."
3,Preparation of bacterial cellulose-chitosan-PVOH composite films,"2.2 Preparation of bacterial cellulose-chitosan-PVOH composite films The resulting wet bacterial films were placed between two sheets of filter paper to remove excessive water. Then, films were immersed in a bath of the mixture chitosan-PVOH. The solution of chitosan was prepared from an aqueous solution of 1% (v/v) of acetic acid at room temperature with vigorous agitation. The PVOH solution was prepared from an aqueous solution heated at 80 °C with vigorous agitation for 2 h. Finally, the BC-PVOH-chitosan films were dried in a Petri dish at room temperature for 2 days. The dried films were cut to specific sizes for each test. The samples were stored in desiccators with saturated salt of sodium bromide or silica gel for 5 days as required for each test."
4,Film thickness measurement,"2.3 Film thickness measurement Films thickness (mm) was measured using a thickness metre ET115S (Etari GmbH, Stuttgart, Germany). The measuring was carried out at 5 locations prior to the characterization tests. The average thickness of the films for each formulation is shown in Table 1 ."
5,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"2.4 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Films were fixed on slides with adhesive carbon tape, metalized with Au, observed and photographed with a high-vacuum microscope (JEOL JSM-6360LV, Jeol Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV."
6,Moisture content at equilibrium,"2.5 Moisture content at equilibrium The water content of the samples stored in desiccators with saturated salt of sodium bromide for 5 days was determined measuring the weight loss. Film portions of 3 cm × 3 cm stored in a desiccator with saturated sodium bromide solution were weighed to the nearest 0.0001 g for the initial sample weight. Then, the samples were dried at 105 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h until constant weight (dry sample weight). Samples were analyzed by triplicate. Equilibrium moisture content (%) was calculated using Eq. (1): (1) Equilibrium moisture content ( % ) = Initial weight − Dry weight Initial weight × 100"
7,Water vapour permeability,"2.6 Water vapour permeability Water vapor permeability (WVP) quantifies the amount of water that diffuses through the film per unit area and time (g/s m Pa), depending on the differential pressure and film thickness. WVP values were obtained gravimetrically following the ASTM Standard Test Method E96 (https://www.astm.org/Standards/E96.htm). A wide-mouth cup (5 × 10−3 m2 area) containing 100 ml of distilled water was sealed with the select films. The cup was placed in the centre of a double-bottom box containing silica gel and placed on the plate of a precision balance. The gradient of partial pressure between both sides of the film produced a driving force for the water flux trough the film. The water flux resulted in a decrease of the weight of the cup. Tests were run at 30 °C for at least 8 h that it is enough time to reach the equilibrium of the water flux. Weight loss of the cup was recorded to the nearest 1 × 10−4 g and plotted as a function of time (Gennadios, Weller, & Gooding, 1994). The slope was evaluated by linear regression (r 2 > 0.99). WVP was calculated according to the combined Fick and Henry laws for gas diffusion through films, using Eq. (2): (2) WVP = Δ w ⋅ x Δ t ⋅ A ⋅ Δ P where Δw/Δt (g/s) is the flux measured as weight loss of the cell per unit of time, x (m) is the film thickness, A (m2) is the exposed area and ΔP (Pa) is the water vapour pressure differential calculated as 4245 Pa at 30 °C (Wexler, 1976). Each test was performed in triplicate."
8,Mechanical properties,"2.7 Mechanical properties The mechanical properties were measured using a texturometer (TA-XTplus, Stable Micro System, UK). Tensile strength (TS, the maximum stress before breaking), percentage of elongation at break (%E, the maximum elongation of the film before rupture) and Young's Modulus (YM, yield stress divided by yield strain in the viscoelastic region) were measured following the standard method D-882 (ASTM). The tests were run with an initial grip separation of 40 mm and a crosshead speed of 0.08 mm/s. Ten samples of each formulation were previously cut into 15 mm × 100 mm samples and stored in desiccators with oversaturated salt of sodium bromide for 5 days. Both ends of the films were fixed in the grips and the strength during extension was measured. In each test, TS and %E were calculated using Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively (Antoniou, Liu, Majeed, & Zhong, 2015): (3) TS ( MPa ) = F L ⋅ x (4) % E ( % ) = l − l 1 l 1 ⋅ 100 In Eq. (3), F is the maximum force before breaking (N), L is the width of the film (mm) and x is the thickness (mm). In Eq. (4), l 1 is the initial length (mm) and l is the length of the film (mm) at the breaking point. Young's modulus was calculated from the slope of the stress-strain curve in the viscoelastic region."
9,"Light barrier properties, transparency and opacity","2.8 Light barrier properties, transparency and opacity A spectrophotometer V-670 (Jasco Inc, Japan) was used to analyze the ultraviolet and visible light barrier properties of the film, using transmittance mode at 2 nm intervals in UV-VIS-NIR regions (190–2500 nm). The test was done in duplicate for each sample. The transparency of the films was calculated from the percent of transmittance at 600 nm using Eq. (5) (Han & Floros, 1997). (5) Transparency = log % T 600 x where %T 600 is the percent transmittance at 600 nm and x is the film thickness (mm). The opacity of the films was calculated from de absorbance of light at 500 nm, following Eq. (6) (Kanatt, Rao, Chawla, & Sharma, 2012). (6) Opacity = A b s 500 x where Abs 500 is the absorbance at 500 nm and x is the film thickness (mm)."
10,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),"2.9 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) A FT-IR (Bomen 102. ABB Ltd, Zurich Switzerland) equipped with a Universal Attenuated Total Reflectance (UATR) accessory with diamond crystal was used to collect the FT-IR spectra of the films. Samples were conditioned at relative humidity of 65 ± 2% and 21 ± 1 °C for at least 48 h prior to the test. FT-IR spectra were collected at a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1 over the range from 400 to 4000 cm−1."
11,Thermal properties of films,"2.10 Thermal properties of films The thermal stability of the developed films was analyzed using a Thermogravimetric Analyzer/Differential Scanning Calorimeter (TGA/DSC1) equipment (Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Columbus, OH). The samples (around 2–4 mg) were placed in hermetic aluminium pans and the test was carried out at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 50 to 400 °C, in atmosphere of N2 (50 ml/min)."
12,Statistical analysis,"2.11 Statistical analysis PVOH and chitosan concentration were considered as independent variables (denoted A and B, respectively) and the effect on the select dependent variables (moisture content, TS, %E, YM and VWP) were calculated. The set of experiments followed a factorial design. Table 1 shows the experiment design. Cook's distance was used the detect outliers (Cook, 1977) and the Box-Cox data transformation was used to reduce anomalies (Sakia, 1992). The multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. The statistical analysis was accomplished using Design Expert® 10.0.6 software (Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA)."
13,Results and discussion,"Biodegradable films were obtained using bacterial cellulose, PVOH and chitosan at several concentrations following the experimental design showed in Table 1. The concentration of PVOH in the bath ranged from 0 to 4% (w/w) and chitosan ranged from 0 to 1% (w/w). At higher concentrations of chitosan and PVOH, the bath was very viscous resulting in too thick films. The average thickness of the films and the results obtained for dependent variables (moisture content, TS, %E, YM and WVP) are listed in Table 1. The effect of the PVOH and chitosan on the dependent variables (moisture content, TS, %E, YM and WVP) were modelled using a second-order polynomial equation. The ANOVA results of the dependent variables are shown in Table 2 . Table 2 also shows the fit statistics values of r 2, predicted r 2, adjusted r 2 and adequate precision for each dependent variable analyzed."
14,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"3.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The top and bottom surfaces of both sides and cross section of the films obtained in experiments 1, 3 and 7 were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 2 shows the top and bottom surface of the films as well as the cross section. The selected experiments allowed to analyze the effect of the PVOH and chitosan on the microstructure of the bacterial cellulose films. As shown Fig. 2a, bacterial cellulose films presented a continuous matrix with a porous surface. Bottom side showed a denser surface and a rough layer on the opposite side. The difference between both sides depended on the fermentation process. Probably, the less dense and porous side was the most recently formed. The cross section of the bacterial cellulose films (Fig. 2a) showed a laminated structure. The acetic bacteria form the pellicle layer by layer. In general, the addition of PVOH and chitosan resulted in a softening of the surface, decreasing the roughness and porosity (Fig. 2b and c). The bottom sides were smoother than the top because they were in contact with the Petri dish during the drying. According to the cross-section micrographs of the experiment 3 (Fig. 2b) and 7 (Fig. 2c), PVOH and chitosan increased the thickness and the density of the film promoting a more compact structure. The thickness increase was more important in formulations containing PVOH than those with chitosan. Chitosan and PVOH had a similar effect on the surface and on the microstructure than that on vegetable regenerated cellulose films studied in previous work (Cazón et al., 2018a, 2018b)."
15,Moisture content at equilibrium,"3.2 Moisture content at equilibrium The content of the moisture of the samples were analyzed. Bacterial cellulose, chitosan and PVOH are hydrophilic components, but with different affinity and interaction capacity with water. The moisture content can modify the properties of the films, mainly the mechanical properties. Hence, determining the moisture content of each formulation can help to interpret the other tests. The moisture content of the developed films conditioned in desiccators with saturated sodium bromide solution for 5 days ranged from 1.82 to 12.55%. Data fitted well to a two-factor interaction mathematical model. The trial 2 was ignored for ANOVA analysis as it was detected as an outlier in the Cook's distance test. The F-value of the model was 68.85 indicating that the model was significant. The p-values of the model terms were significant (p < 0.05). The r 2 value was 0.98. Adjusted r 2 compares the goodness-of-fit for regression models that contain differing numbers of independent variables. Predicted r 2 is a measure of how well the model predicts a response value. The adjusted r 2 and predicted r 2 should be within approximately 0.20 of each other to be in reasonable agreement. In this case, the difference between the predicted r 2 (0.98) and the adjusted r 2 (0.95) was less than 0.2, which is reasonable. Adequate precision is a signal/noise ratio. It compares the range of the predicted values at the design points to average prediction error. Ratios greater than 4 indicate adequate model discrimination. The adequate precision obtained was 25.55, implying an adequate signal. The F-values of the terms allow determining which component has greater effect on the response. The F-values of the model terms indicated that the moisture content of the samples was mainly affected by the chitosan concentration, followed by the interaction between chitosan-PVOH. Eq. (7) predicts the moisture content of the bacterial cellulose films as a function of chitosan and PVOH concentrations. (7) Moisture content ( % ) = 1.72 + 10.57 ⋅ Chitosan ( % ) + 1.58 ⋅ PVOH ( % ) − 2.22 ⋅ Chitosan ( % ) ⋅ PVOH ( % ) According to the response surface (Fig. 3a), the presence of chitosan or PVOH in bacterial cellulose films increased the moisture content. Mainly the chitosan is responsible for the increase of moisture content. This increase was due to the hydrophilic nature of the chitosan and PVOH. The chitosan effect was more significant due to its large amount of hydrophilic amino and hydroxyl groups. The moisture adsorption behaviour of chitosan-PVOH blends in different humidity environments were investigated in previous studies (Liu et al., 2018). Results in this study demonstrated a higher moisture content of the composites when increasing the chitosan concentration."
16,Water vapour permeability (WVP),"3.3 Water vapour permeability (WVP) The WVP values ranged from 1.47 × 10−11 to 3.40 × 10−11 g/m s Pa. Data were well fitted to a quadratic model. Experiment 3 was ignored because it was identified as an outlier by the Cook's distance test. The F-value of the model was 143.37 with a p-value of 0.0069, indicating that the mathematical model was significant. The value of r 2 was 0.99. The predicted r 2 (0.95) was in reasonable agreement with the adjusted r 2 (0.99). The adequate precision was higher than 4 (39.39), implying an adequate signal. The F-values indicate that the chitosan had the most important effect on the WVP response, followed by the interaction chitosan-PVOH. Eq. (8) predicts the response on WVP as a function of chitosan and PVOH. (8) WVP ( g/m ⋅ s ⋅ Pa ) = 2.38 × 10 − 11 + 4.71 × 10 − 3 ⋅ Chitosan ( % ) − 6.23 × 10 − 12 ⋅ PVOH ( % ) = 4.30 × 10 − 12 ⋅ Chitosan ( % ) ⋅ PVOH ( % ) + 3.45 × 10 − 12 ⋅ Chitosan ( % ) 2 = 8.65 × 10 − 13 ⋅ PVOH ( % ) 2 As shown in the response surface (Fig. 3b), the WVP pattern depended on the components blended with the BC. BC-chitosan blends increased the WVP when the chitosan content increased. The hydrophilic property of the chitosan could explain the increase of WVP. Conversely, BC-PVOH films had lower permeability than pure cellulose films. Pure BC films showed a WVP of 2.38 × 10−11 (g/m s Pa) and pure PVOH films reported a WVP of 1.70 × 10−11 g/m s Pa at 30 °C (Jipa et al., 2012). Pure BC films have an open porous structure, which facilitate the diffusion of the water molecules through cellulose fibres. Some voids between the cellulose fibres could have been filled by the PVOH decreasing the porosity and hindering the diffusion of the water molecules. PVOH is a hydrophilic polymer, but its interaction capacity with water is lower than that of chitosan (Liu et al., 2018). For this reason, bacterial cellulose-PVOH films showed lower WVP values than that of bacterial cellulose-chitosan films. However, this behaviour changed in presence of chitosan-PVOH, producing a higher increase of the permeability when the concentration of both polymers increased. This effect has been reported in previous studies as chitosan-PVOH films manifested higher WVP values than pure chitosan or PVOH films. The authors justified this effect as a result of the formation of a more open matrix. The hydration layers of the chitosan resulted in a lower density of the polymeric matrix. This structure facilitated the transfer of water molecules through the network (Bonilla, Fortunati, Atarés, Chiralt, & Kenny, 2014). Regenerated cellulose-chitosan-PVOH films showed the same effect on WVP (Cazón et al., 2018b)."
17,Mechanical properties,"3.4 Mechanical properties The TS values ranged from 20.76 to 41.65 MPa. Data fitted well to a quadratic equation. The F-value of the model was 30.63, indicating that the model was significant. All terms in the quadratic model were significant (p < 0.05). The value of r 2 was 0.98 and the predicted r 2 was in reasonable agreement with the adjusted r 2. The adequate precision obtained was 16.94, implying an adequate signal. The F-values of the model terms indicated that TS was highly affected by the chitosan. Eq. (9) forecasts the values of TS as a function of chitosan and PVOH concentrations. (9) TS ( MPa ) = 20.99 + 33.90 ⋅ Chitosan ( % ) + 6.29 ⋅ PVOH ( % ) − 2.30 ⋅ Chitosan ( % ) ⋅ PVOH ( % ) − 16.33 ⋅ Chitosan ( % ) 2 − 1.09 ⋅ PVOH ( % ) 2 Pure regenerated cellulose film reported a TS value of 38.30 MPa from a dissolution of 4% of cellulose microcrystalline (Cazón et al., 2018b). Pure BC films showed a TS value of 20.76 MPa. BC films showed lower TS values than regenerated cellulose films, despite BC has higher crystallinity, because in its structure there are not remains of amorphous structures. There are two reasons responsible of this TS difference. One reason is the variation of the thickness. Pure regenerated cellulose studied was three folds thicker than pure BC films. Lower thickness could imply lower interaction among the cellulose fibres. It was observed that the TS values of the regenerated cellulose films depended on the cellulose concentration (Cazón et al., 2018b). In addition, bacterial cellulose had a less packed structure than regenerated cellulose, as shown the SEM images. These differences in the microstructure could affect the resistance to rupture, but also could promote the interaction with other polymers in the blend. Probably, longer fermentation time of the acetic bacteria to obtain thicker films, could help to increase the hydrogen bond interactions and increase the TS values. In literature, TS values have been reported between 5 and 96 MPa for pure BC films (Cai & Kim, 2010; Phisalaphong & Jatupaiboon, 2008; Saibuatong & Phisalaphong, 2010; Szymańska-Chargot et al., 2017). The wide range of TS values could be explained because the properties of cellulose depend on the specific assembling and supramolecular order controlled by the culture medium, fermentation conditions and treatment of cellulose. The measuring conditions or the moisture content of the samples also affect the obtained values (Hu et al., 2014). On the other hand, analysing the interaction with other polymers, the addition of chitosan and/or PVOH increase in general the TS values of the films. The effect on TS of chitosan and PVOH is shown in Fig. 4a. TS values reported for pure chitosan films elaborated from an aqueous solution of acetic acid and similar storage conditions ranged from 50 to 70 MPa (Leceta, Guerrero, & De La Caba, 2013; Li, Zivanovic, Davidson, & Kit, 2010; Liu et al., 2018). Regarding pure PVOH films, the TS values reported ranged from 40 to 50 MPa (Hu & Wang, 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Lu, Wang, & Drzal, 2008). Both polymers reported higher TS values than pure BC. Thus, films were reinforced after combining BC with polymers with higher TS values. New physical interactions among the components took place, due to the possibility interaction between –OH and –NH2 groups in these polymers. These new physical interactions were able to improve the mechanical properties of the blend films (Bahrami, Kordestani, Mirzadeh, & Mansoori, 2003; Bonilla et al., 2014). Besides, as observed in the SEM images, the presence of PVOH and chitosan increased the density of the structure, obtaining a more compact structure, which explain the increase of TS. However, at the highest chitosan and PVOH concentrations, TS decreased slightly, but maintained higher values than those of pure BC. This change was due to the increase of the moisture content of the samples due to the hydrophilic nature of chitosan and PVOH. The water had a plasticizing effect on the polymers, promoting the mobility of the polymeric chains (Liu et al., 2018). Higher incubation times (14 days) and freeze drying (−40 °C for 3 days), modified the structure of BC-chitosan films, modified the mechanical properties and allowed obtaining TS values of 450 MPa (Kim et al., 2011). The %E values ranged from 2.28 to 21.82%. Data fitted well to a linear model. The Box-Cox plot recommended transforming the data to logarithmic base 10 of %E to get a better fit of the equation. The F-value of the model was 9.80, indicating that the model is significant. There is only a 1.29% chance that a F-value could be due to noise. All model terms were significant (p < 0.05) and the value of r 2 was 0.77. In this case, the predicted r 2 of 0.48 was slightly away from the adjusted r 2 of 0.69. However, the adequate precision obtained was 8.85, indicating an adequate signal to noise ratio. The F-values of the model terms indicated that chitosan produced a slightly higher effect on the %E. Eq. (10) predicts the %E response as a function of the chitosan and PVOH concentrations. (10) L o g 10 ( % E ) = 0.41 + 0.43 ⋅ Chitosan ( % ) + 0.10 ⋅ PVOH ( % ) Reported %E values for pure BC ranges from 0.6 to 5% (Cai & Kim, 2010). According to the response surface (Fig. 4b), the presence of chitosan or PVOH in BC films increased the %E values. This behaviour was more significant in formulations containing chitosan and PVOH. The %E of pure BC films was 2.28%, higher than that of regenerated cellulose (1.55%) (Cazón et al., 2018b). The higher %E of BC allowed an easier manipulation than that of regenerated cellulose. Developed films in this study significantly increased the elasticity up to a maximum value of 21.82% when chitosan and PVOH were added. This increase in elasticity facilitated the manipulation of the films. Besides, adding chitosan and PVOH increased the moisture content which had an plasticizing effect on the film (Liu et al., 2018; Suyatma, Tighzert, Copinet, & Coma, 2005). Probably the interaction of cellulose fibres with PVOH and water molecules reduced the frictional forces between polymeric chains, facilitating their mobility. In addition, new interactions cellulose-chitosan-PVOH-water through hydrogen bonds could modify the elasticity of the polymer (Liu et al., 2018; Suyatma et al., 2005). Regenerated cellulose-chitosan-PVOH films reached a maximum elasticity of 12.82% (Cazón et al., 2018b), lower than the bacterial cellulose-chitosan-PVOH films. This result suggests that the more open three-dimensional structure of the BC promoted the interaction among the polymers in the composite film. On the other hand the percentage of elongation at break of the composite films was superior to the individual component, probably promoted by the physical interaction of chitosan-PVOH in the blends (Liu et al., 2018). The Young's modulus values obtained were in the range from 1043.88 to 2247.82 MPa. Data fitted well to a quadratic equation. Trial 7 was disregarded because it was identified as an outlier by the Cook's distance test. The F-value of the model was 302.83 with a p-value = 0.0033. These statistical parameters indicated that the mathematical model was significant. The value of r 2 was 0.99 and the adjusted r 2 (0.99) was in reasonable agreement with the predicted r 2 (0.98). The adequate precision value was higher than 4 (48.82), implying an adequate signal to noise ratio. F-values indicated that the quadratic effect of chitosan and PVOH content had the most important effect on the response of %E, followed by the linear effect of the PVOH. Eq. (11) predicts the response on Young's Modulus as a function of the components of chitosan and PVOH. (11) Young's Modulus ( MPa ) = 1034.58 + 2301.07 ⋅ Chitosan ( % ) + 579.66 ⋅ PVOH ( % ) + 189.12 ⋅ Chitosan ( % ) ⋅ PVOH ( % ) − 2929.43 ⋅ Chitosan ( % ) 2 − 144.35 ⋅ PVOH ( % ) 2 According to the response surface (Fig. 5 ), YM values increased when the concentration of chitosan and PVOH increased up to intermediate values. This behaviour could be explained due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed among the components in the film. Similar results were observed in regenerated cellulose-chitosan-PVOH (Cazón et al., 2018b). However, if the concentration of chitosan and PVOH continued increasing, YM values decreased, especially with the increasing of chitosan. Also, the increase of moisture content in the films significantly decreased the YM values. The effect of water on YM has been reported in chitosan-PVOH film. In general, YM values of pure chitosan film range from 1500 to 3000 MPa, depending on the chitosan concentration, molecular weight, solvent, deacetylation degree and storage conditions (Fernandes et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2018). YM values for PVOH films range from 1000 to 1500 MPa (Paralikar, Simonsen, & Lombardi, 2008; Roohani et al., 2008). However, these values dropped to 60 MPa and 5 MPa, respectively when conditioning the films at high relative humidity (75% RH), demonstrating the effect of water molecules on the YM (Liu et al., 2018)."
18,"Light barrier properties, transparency and opacity","3.5 Light barrier properties, transparency and opacity One of the main objectives of active packaging is maintaining the quality of food to increase the shelf life. Hence, to develop biofilms with good optical barrier in the region of UV-radiation is a feasible strategy. UV-light is the main responsible for the appearance of the singlet oxygen, the most common cause of lipid oxidation. This oxidative reaction alters the odour, taste and colour of food, diminishing its organoleptic qualities, that affect the acceptability of food to consumers (Goudarzi, Shahabi-Ghahfarrokhi, & Babaei-Ghazvini, 2017; Vilela et al., 2017). On the other hand, biodegradable films with UV-light barriers properties should have an adequate transparency. Biopolymers with good values of transparency applied directly on food provide a good visual appearance, increasing their consumer acceptancy (Cazón et al., 2018a). The lipids are more susceptible to oxidative reactions in the region from 200 to 280 nm wavelength. Fig. 6a shows the transmittance of the experiments 1, 3 and 7 in the 200–280 nm UV range. The select samples allow to analyze the optical properties of pure bacterial cellulose, and the effect of the PVOH and chitosan on the composite films. In this region, pure bacterial cellulose showed transmittance values of 0% up to a wavelength of 230 nm, then increasing up to 2%. Pure bacterial cellulose films showed lower transmittance values than pure regenerated cellulose which ranged from 0.4 to 5.3% (Cazón et al., 2018a). This difference is probably due to the purity of the BC and the structural differences between the films. The addition of PVOH increased the transmittance at 210 nm up to 11.65%. BC-chitosan spectra showed that the transmittance values remained low, without significant differences when compared to pure bacterial cellulose. In previous studies, chitosan showed lower transmittance values in the UV region between 200 and 280 nm (Kalaycıoğlu, Torlak, Akın-Evingür, Özen, & Erim, 2017; Kanatt et al., 2012). That is the reason because BC-chitosan films kept the low values. In the UV-VIS region (280–800 nm) (Fig. 6b), pure BC films kept low values of transmittance, with a maximum transmittance of 11%. Adding PVOH to BC resulted in the greatest effect on transmittance, increasing the value up 46.6%. However, in chitosan-BC samples, the transmittance increased constantly with the wavelength, up to 32%. This increase of the transmittance affected the visual properties modifying the transparency and opacity of the films. Pure cellulose films had a smoked colour, but the formulations with PVOH resulted in films with a translucent and shiny appearance. However, the transparency values obtained for samples 1, 3 and 7 were 47.6, 24.5 and 48.0, respectively. According to these results, pure BC film had the best transparency value, followed by the chitosan film and then PVOH film. These values were strongly affected by the thickness. Films with PVOH were three times thicker than pure BC samples. BC-chitosan films were twice as thick as pure BC. For this reason, it is necessary to complete this information with the opacity. The opacity values calculated were 50.9, 6.2 and 20.9 for pure BC, BC-PVOH and BC-chitosan films, respectively. The transparency and opacity values indicate that the PVOH, followed by the chitosan, improved the optical properties of the films in the visible region, thus improving their appearance as shown in Fig. 7 . In this region, the transmittance values were slightly lower than the values obtained for regenerated cellulose-chitosan-PVOH films previously studied (Cazón et al., 2018a)."
19,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),"3.6 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) The interactions between BC-PVOH-chitosan at structural level were evaluated by FT-IR measurements. Fig. 6c shows the FT-IR spectra of the experiment 1, 3 and 7. The spectra show the characteristic absorption bands of BC, PVOH and chitosan. A broad band in the 3000–3600 cm−1 region is attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and –OH stretching vibrations in BC and PVOH. The addition of PVOH resulted in a slight displacement of this peak at a higher wavenumber, probably due to the increase of –OH groups and the formation of hydrogen bonding. The –NH stretching vibration of chitosan is also located in this region. This increase of the absorbance could also be associated to the interaction with –OH group (Cazón et al., 2018a; Pavaloiu, Stoica-Guzun, Stroescu, Jinga, & Dobre, 2014). A weak signal at 2920 cm−1 appeared in the three samples, due to the –CH stretching. The absorbance peaks observed around 1550 cm−1 were assigned to –NH2 deformation vibration of chitosan (Zhao, Teixeira, Gänzle, & Saldaña, 2018). However, FT-IR spectra of pure BC and BC-PVOH films showed a peak of absorbance at 1550 cm−1, with lower intensity. Probably, due to the presence of residues from the culture medium that could not be completely removed during the washing process, since films elaborated with regenerated cellulose did not show absorbance at this wavelength (Cazón et al., 2018a). The absorption bands with a maximum at 1055 cm−1 and 1020 cm−1 are assigned to the C–O–C pyranose ring stretching vibrations and C–H ring deformation, respectively. In this region, the BC-PVOH bands are shifted in comparison to the pure BC spectra, indicating polymeric association through hydrogen bonding (Pereira, de Arruda, & Stefani, 2015)."
20,Thermal properties of films TGA-DSC,"3.7 Thermal properties of films TGA-DSC Thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry of the samples from the experiments 1, 3 and 7 were carried out simultaneously. These measurements allowed assessing the stability of pure BC and the effect of adding PVOH and chitosan on the thermal stability of the films. Fig. 8 shows the thermograms obtained for each sample. The first endothermic peak (60–110) °C corresponded to the volatilization of water from the films samples (Martins et al., 2009). In agreement with the data obtained in the measurement of moisture content in equilibrium, this first peak resulted in a weight loss of 3.4, 3.9 and 5.3%, for the pure BC, BC-PVOH and BC-chitosan films, respectively. In Fig. 8, the endothermic peak at 250 °C corresponded to the onset temperature of thermal degradation of cellulose, in accordance with the data observed in previous works (Mohammadkazemi et al., 2015). At 400 °C the decomposition of the BC corresponded to the 66.7% of the weight loss. The thermogram of the BC-PVOH samples showed two endothermic peaks in the second region. The first endothermic peak, at about 220 °C, corresponds to the thermal degradation of PVA (Bonilla et al., 2014). In the 200–240 °C range, the percentage of the weight loss was 5.2–7.2% of the total initial weight. The loss of weight in this interval was not significant, which indicated that part of PVOH, degraded at higher temperatures probably due to the interaction with cellulose. The second endothermic peak, at 260–340 °C, corresponded to the 11.1–74.4% weight loss of the initial weight. Data suggest that the BC-PVOH interaction increased the thermal stability of the films, increasing the degradation temperature of the PVOH and the BC. On the other hand, in presence of chitosan, the degradation onset temperature of the sample was found in the 260–270 °C region. The presence of chitosan increased the degradation temperature of the sample compared to that of pure BC. At the 260–340 °C region, the weight loss was 12.7–45.0%, reaching a weight loss of 55.1% up to a temperature of 400 °C, indicating that the interaction BC-chitosan increased the thermal stability of the sample. Regenerated cellulose-PVOH and regenerated cellulose-chitosan also showed this increase in thermal stability due to the interaction between the polymers (Cazón et al., 2018a)."
21,Conclusions,"Results showed that it is feasible to obtain BC-based films with potential applications as active biopolymer for food packaging. Combining BC with PVOH and chitosan allowed improving or modifying the mechanical, vapour permeability, thermal and optical properties of the films. The equilibrium moisture content had an important effect on the mechanical properties of the films. TS and %E values of the samples increased with the presence of PVOH and chitosan. WVP decreased slightly when PVOH was added into the formulation. Chitosan increased the permeability of the films. PVOH and chitosan decreased the porosity of the BC films and increased the films density. The UV-VIS spectra showed the optimal optical barrier properties of BC-based films against UV-radiation. Adding PVOH increased the transmittance values in the UV-VIS region and improved the transparency and visual appearance of the films. FT-IR and TGA-DSC indicated the interaction among the polymers. These properties could be useful in food industry as an alternative to synthetic film preventing the lipid oxidations in foods."
