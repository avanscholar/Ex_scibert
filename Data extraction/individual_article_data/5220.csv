0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered an ideal energy carrier of the future, and many experts have proposed the development of hydrogen economy [1]. However, before hydrogen economy becomes a reality, platform technology of hydrogen energy, in particular the technology leading to sustainable production of H2, should be extensively developed. Biological hydrogen production via direct/indirect water biophotolysis or dark/photo fermentation [2] is energy effective and environmentally friendly route of producing H2 [3]. Among them, dark fermentation that converts organic substrates into H2 is of special interest because it is considered the most commercially feasible biological means of producing H2 due to its high H2 production rate (HPR) and an additional benefit of waste reduction [4]. Most dark H2 fermentation is carried out with a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and the most effective carbon substrate for bioH2 production was carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, sucrose or starch) [5]. However, bioH2 production with CSTR reactor is usually very sensitive to the change in the environmental factors (e.g., pH and hydraulic retention time (HRT)) [6]. In addition, operation of CSTR at a high dilution rate (or a low HRT) usually leads to washout of biomass causing a severe operational instability and inefficient H2 production [7]. Therefore, how to improve cell retention under a high hydraulic pressure (or low HRT) could play a pivotal role in achieving a stable and efficient HPR [8]. Several strategies have been proposed to enhance biomass retention for high-rate bioH2 production; such as cell immobilization [9–11] or granular sludge system [6,12]. In this study, the HRT-dependent H2 production was investigated using three different types of bioreactors, namely, CSTR, immobilized-cell-seeded anaerobic bioreactor (ICSAB) and agitated granular sludge bed (AGSB). The latter two bioreactors were designed to improve the cell retention when they are operated under a high substrate feeding rate. Meanwhile, the bacterial community structure from steady-state samples of the three types of bioreactors was analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), since the bacterial community information may turn out to be a useful indicator for the performance of H2 fermentation in a mixed-culture-based bioH2 production system [13,14]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,H2-producing sludge,"2.1 H2-producing sludge The anaerobic sludge obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant in Taichung, Taiwan was used as the seed sludge. The typical pH, volatile suspended solid (VSS) and total solid (TS) concentration of the sludge were 6.81, 33.3 and 65.1g/l, respectively. The TS was determined by taking 10ml of sample, and put it in the oven at 105°C for 24h, and weighed the sample after dried. The hydrogen productivity of the seed sludge was enhanced by thermal treatment at 100°C for 1h to inhibit the methanogenic activity. The thermally treated sludge was further acclimated in a continuous culture operated at HRT 12–8h with an influent sucrose concentration of 20gCOD/l [7]. The effluent sludge was collected for fermentative H2 production with three types of bioreactors, namely, CSTR, ICSAB and AGSB systems."
3,Medium compositions,"2.2 Medium compositions The medium used for H2 fermentation consisted of glucose as the sole carbon substrate ( initial glucose concentration = 20 g COD / l ) and sufficient inorganic supplements (mg/l); NH4HCO3, 5240; NaHCO3, 6720; K2HPO4, 125; MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 100; MnSO 4 · 6 H 2 O , 15; FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , 25; CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O , 5; CaCl2, 100; CoCl 2 · 5 H 2 O , 0.125. Glucose is used as the carbon substrate since it is a common and abundant substrate that could come from hydrolysis of starch or cellulosic feedstock. Glucose is also shown to be a very effective substrate for fermentative H2 production, leading to excellent hydrogen productivities [15]."
4,Immobilization of H2-producing sludge with silicone gel,"2.3 Immobilization of H2-producing sludge with silicone gel Hydrogen-producing sludge was mixed with activated carbon powder (Union Chemical Works Ltd., Hsinchu, Taiwan) at a volume (ml) to weight (g) ratio of 10:1. The sludge/activated carbon slurry was then mixed with silicone gel (SC) ( weight to weight ratio = 1 : 10 ) . The final mixture was then extruded to produce SC-immobilized sludge, which was in disc shape with a height, diameter and density of 0.3, 0.4cm and 1.14g/cm3, respectively. The detailed procedures of preparing the immobilized sludge were described in our previous study [11]."
5,"Set-up and operation of CSTR, ICSAB and AGSB for H2 production","2.4 Set-up and operation of CSTR, ICSAB and AGSB for H2 production Schematic descriptions of the bioreactors for H2 production are shown in Fig. 1 . The experiments were carried out in three different types of bioreactors; namely, CSTR, ICSAB and AGSB, with a working volume of 4.0, 1.2 and 0.9l, respectively. For CSTR system, the suspended H2-producing sludge was used as the seed. Nearly 43 days were required for start-up to reach a constant effluent quality and reactor biomass concentration. The starting HRT was 12h and the HRT was shortened to 10, 8, 6 and 4h in a stepwise manner through 37, 26, 23 and 19 days operation intervals, respectively. For the ICSAB system, the bioreactor was loaded with 10% (volume to volume; v/v) of the aforementioned immobilized sludge, resulting in an initial biomass content of ca. 0.42gVSS/l in the ICSAB reactor. For AGSB system, the reactor was initially supplemented with powdered activated carbon (PAC) carriers at 1% (v/v) prior to addition of seed sludge, giving rise to an initial biomass content of ca. 3–4gVSS/l in the AGSB bioreactor. The solid carriers were shown to be effective in stimulating formation of granular sludge [6,12]. The ICSAB and AGSB systems were both operated on batch mode for 48h to activate the H2-producing sludge before they were subsequently switched to continuous mode at a designated HRT of 4h. In all three bioreactor systems, the feeding medium contained a glucose concentration of 20gCOD/l. As indicated in Fig. 1, the effluent of the reactor was introduced into a gas–liquid separator, where the gaseous and soluble products were collected separately. After reaching steady-state operation (based on a constant volumetric HPR with a variation of within 5–10% for 3–5 days), the composition of gas products (H2 and CO2) and soluble metabolites (volatile fatty acids, alcohols, etc.) produced during H2 fermentation was monitored. The pH and biomass concentration (represented by VSS) in the effluent were also measured (Fig. 1). The reactor was operated at a temperature of 40°C and a pH of within 6.0–7.0. A gas meter (Type TG1; Ritter Inc., Germany) was used to measure the amount of gas products evolved and the gas volumes were calibrated to 25°C and 760mmHg."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Hydrogen gas content in the biogas was determined with a gas chromatography (GC-14A, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The carrier gas was argon and the column was packed with Porapak Q (80/100 mesh, Waters Corp., USA). The VFA and ethanol were also detected by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-14A) using a flame ionization detector (FID). The carrier gas was N2 and the packing material was FON (Shimadzu, Japan). VSS (representing the biomass concentration) was measured according to the procedures described in Standard Methods [16]. The carbohydrate (i.e., glucose) concentration in the effluent was also determined according to the phenol–sulfuric acid method [17]."
7,DNA isolation and PCR-DGGE analysis,"2.6 DNA isolation and PCR-DGGE analysis For extraction of genomic DNA, the sludge samples were dispersed and washed twice in 1 × PBS (phosphate buffer saline) consisting of 130mM NaCl and 10mM Na2HPO4. The cells were concentrated by centrifugation at 8000rpm for 5min. Total genomic DNA was obtained and purified by using the Blood & Tissue Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System (Viogene, Taiwan) following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were stored at −20°C before PCR reactions. For the DNA quality, to determine the DNA purity and to keep the A260/280 degrees range of 1.7–2.0, the Biotech Photometer (WPA, Cambridge, UK) was carried out for spectrophotometer. The primer set, EUB968f with GC-clamp and Univ1392r, was used for amplification of 16S rDNA gene. The PCR mixtures ( 50 μ l ) contained each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at a concentration of 200, 1.5 μ M MgCl2, each primer at a concentration of 0.2 μ M , 1.25U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), and the PCR buffer supplied with the enzyme. After initial 95°C heating for 10min, 28 cycles of 95°C (1min), 54°C (1min) and 72°C (1min) were performed of PCR reactions used an automatic thermal cycler iCyclerTM (Bio-Rad, Los Angeles, CA). DGGE analysis of the PCR products was performed with the DCode-System (Bio-Rad). The 6% (wt/vol) acrylamide solution was used to cast a gel with denaturant gradients ranging from 40 to 65% (100% denaturant agent was defined as 7.0M urea and 40% deionized formamide). Electrophoresis was conducted in a 1 × TAE buffer solution at 80V and 60°C for 12h. The gels was stained with ethidium bromide for 10min, rinsed with water for 5min, and then photographed with Kodak 1D v.3.6.1 system (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY) equipped with a UV illuminator."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effect of HRT on H2-producing performance of suspended cultures in CSTR,"3.1 Effect of HRT on H2-producing performance of suspended cultures in CSTR The correlation between HRT and H2-producing performance in CSTR system fed with glucose-based medium is shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2 . As depicted in Fig. 2, the HPR increased from 0.19 to 0.60l/h/l when the HRT was shortened from 12 to 6h, including a sharp increase in HPR for a HRT decrease of 12 to 10h. However, when the HRT was further decreased from 6 to 4h, the HPR decreased significantly from 0.60 to 0.38l/h/l. As the influent glucose concentration was fixed at 20gCOD/l, a decrease in HRT represents an increase in substrate loading rate. In general, if H2-producing bacterial population can be stably maintained in the bioreactor against an increase in hydraulic dilution arising from a decrease in HRT, the HPR should increase with decreasing HRT. This explains why HPR increased when the CSTR system was operated at a progressively decreasing HRT from 12 to 6h. However, for more complete inspection of the trend of HRT-dependence of HPR shown in Fig. 2 (in particular, for the operation at HRT 4h), the results of H2 yield (HY), substrate conversion, and biomass concentration should be considered as well. As indicated in Table 1, the HY value increased initially when HRT was decreased from 12 to 10h, maintained nearly constant (1.5–1.6mol H2/mol glucose) at a HRT of 10, 8 and 6h, and finally decreased sharply to 0.75molH2/mol glucose when the system was operated at HRT = 4 h . Meanwhile, the substrate (glucose) conversion was over 90% for HRT of 12–6h, but again decreased significantly to 78.5% at the shortest HRT operated (4h). On the other hand, biomass concentration deceased slightly from 3.49 to 2.19gVSS/l for a decrease in HRT from 12 to 6h, whereas a severe loss of biomass was observed when a HRT of 4h was used. In contrast to HPR, the H2 content in the biogas did not vary significantly with changes in HRT, but still reached a higher level of 43–52% when the reactor was operated at a HRT of 6–10h. The foregoing results indicate that the decrease in H2 production efficiency under 4h HRT has a close connection with the loss of biomass content in the reactor (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Although operation at 4h HRT provided a higher substrate loading rate, the biomass growth apparently cannot compete with the dilution effect due to the faster volumetric feeding rate, resulting in washout of cells. As a consequence, both the HPR and HY markedly decreased. The best HPR (0.60l/h/l) and HY (1.63molH2/mol glucose) occurred when the CSTR system was conducted at a HRT of 6 and 10h, respectively."
10,Low-HRT operations using ICSAB and AGSB systems,"3.2 Low-HRT operations using ICSAB and AGSB systems Our results show that the H2 production efficiency of CSTR system was significantly lower while operating at HRT = 4 h , due primarily to the poor cell retention under high-rate feeding at 4h HRT. To examine whether the H2 productivity can be further enhanced by retaining the cells within the reactor under a high feeding rate (e.g., HRT = 4 h ), two different bioreactor design strategies (i.e., ICSAB and AGSB) were applied. In ICSAB system, immobilized cells were loaded to maintain a stable biomass content in the reactor and may also enhance biomass concentration in the reactor due to formation of granular sludge [14]. In AGSB, activated carbon was added into the reactor to stimulate rapid sludge granulation for better biomass retention [6,12]. The results (Fig. 2b) show that when compared with the results from CSTR system, both ICSAB and AGSB bioreactors allowed better biomass retention while operating at a HRT of 4h, giving a biomass concentration of 2.46 and 10.3gVSS/l, respectively. These biomass contents are much higher than that obtained in CSTR system (1.63gVSS/l). As a result, both ICSAB and AGSB gave rise to higher HPR and HY, especially for AGSB system (Table 1). The dramatically high biomass content in AGSB system was due mainly to the formation of granular sludge with a size of 1.5 ± 0.5 mm . In contrast, no significant granules were observed in ICSAB system, probably because the substrate feeding rate (at HRT = 4 h ) was not high enough to initiate granule formation in that system. Our recent work showed that significant granulation in ICSAB system occurred at a very short HRT of 0.5h [14]. Therefore, among the three bioreactors examined, the AGSB system seemed to be the most preferable bioreactor for operation at a short HRT of 4h, resulting in a high HPR and HY of 0.97l/h/l and 1.54molH2/mol glucose, respectively."
11,Soluble metabolites and carbon substrate conversion,"3.3 Soluble metabolites and carbon substrate conversion In CSTR system, substrate conversion exceeded 90% for operation at HRT = 12 – 6 h , indicating an efficient substrate utilization under those conditions (Table 1). Increasing substrate feeding rate (i.e. at HRT = 4 h ) led to a drastic decrease in substrate conversion (78%). This may be attributed to the washout of glucose-consuming H2-production bacterial populations, since the biomass concentration dropped sharply to 1.63gVSS/l. However, by improving biomass retention using immobilized cells (ICSAB system) and activated carbon carriers (AGSB system), the substrate conversion also improved to 96–99% while operating at 4h HRT. This suggests that enhancing the retention of active biomass seemed to be an effective strategy to elevate both substrate conversion and H2 production efficiency. Thus, the results demonstrate that the ICSAB and AGSB systems (especially AGSB) proposed in this study possess the advantage and application potential in bioH2 production under a short HRT (e.g., HRT = 4 h ). The major soluble metabolites produced from the three bioreactors (CSTR, ICSAB, AGSB) were quite similar, as acetate and butyrate were the dominant metabolites, accounting for 66–70% of total soluble microbial products (SMP) (Table 2 ). In CSTR system, the total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) and SMP increased as HRT decreased from 12 to 6h (Table 2). The production of acetate (HAc) and butyrate (HBu) contributed to 17–40% and 34–59% of SMP, whereas alcohol to SMP (EtOH/SMP) ratio was lower than 10%. The high HAc/SMP and HBu/SMP and low EtOH/SMP ratios indicate an efficient bioH2 generation system since HAc and HBu production is in general positively correlated to H2 production, whereas generation of solvents (e.g., alcohol) consume free electron derived from NADH, thereby being unfavorable to H2 production [2,18]. However, when the HRT was shortened to 4h, the TVFA and SMP decreased nearly 30–40% when compared with those produced from operation at 6h HRT. Meanwhile, the EtOH/SMP ratio went up to nearly 20% when the system was conducted at 4h HRT. The results on soluble metabolite formation are in accord with the poor H2-producing performance of CSTR at HRT = 4 h (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Operating at a HRT of 4h, the ICSAB and AGSB systems produced a significant higher amount of TVFA and SMP than CSTR at 4h HRT (Table 2) as production of HAc and HBu were also predominant. For ICSAB and AGSB, the HAc/SMP and HBu/SMP ratio was 23–25% and 50–51%, respectively. All those results reflect a higher HPR with the ICSAB and AGSB systems. Moreover, the metabolite composition obtained from the three reactors examined indicates that the seed sludge contained effective H2 producing populations and the operation conditions were also favorable for fermentative H2 production."
12,Effect of HRT on bacterial community structure in the three bioreactor systems,"3.4 Effect of HRT on bacterial community structure in the three bioreactor systems Sludge samples from each operation stages were collected and their corresponding bacterial communities were analyzed using PCR-DGGE method targeting 16s rDNA. Analysis of communities by DGGE demonstrates the presence of distinguishable bands in separation patterns. The bands were most likely derived from as many different species constituting these populations, thereby generating a DGGE profile of the populations. As shown in Fig. 3 , each sludge sample had its own characteristic profile. Bands 1, 2 and 3 from the DGGE profile were further purified and were identified as Clostridium rumosum (Accession No.: AY699288, 99% identity), Clostridium sp. (Accession No.: AY534872, 99% identity), and Clostridium indolis (Accession No.: Y18184, 99% identity), respectively. Meanwhile, by comparing to previous identified sequence standards (Lane Std in Fig. 3), bands 4, 5 and 6 were identified as Clostridium pasteurianum, Klebsiella oxytoca and Streptococcus sp., respectively. Shifts of microbial population at the different stages of reactor operation were observed (Fig. 3, Lanes C12 to C4). C. rumosum was the major bacterial species in the reactor when operated at HRT 12h and it was replaced by C. indolis when HRT was changed to 8, 6 and 4h. Accompanied by a significantly increased HY, from 0.89molH2/mol glucose to 1.6molH2/mol glucose and then maintained at 1.5molH2/mol glucose, this shift of predominant Clostridium sp. is an indication that C. indolis may play an important role in raising the H2 producing efficiency. No significant change of bacterial community was observed when operated at HRT 4h, however, loss of biomass under this high flow rate is considered the major cause contributing to the decrease of HPR and HY. Lane O, ICS, PAC and CSTR in Fig. 3 demonstrated the bacterial community composition of samples collected from the original sludge, immobilized cell-seeded anaerobic reactor (ICSAB), and PAC added AGSB reactor, and the CSTR reactor (all three reactors were operated at 4h HRT). Composition of microorganisms in the original sludge sample was not only significantly different but also more complex from what existed in the reactors. Even though several Clostridium species were identified in the heat-selected and incubated sludge samples, only C. indolis were found in the original sample. This is an indication that most of the Clostridium species were either present as spores in the original sludge or the amount of their active cells was too small to be detected unless certain selection pressure such as thermal or acidic treatment applied. The results show that bacterial compositions of samples from the ICSAB and AGSB reactors were similar but differed from that observed in the CSTR reactor (Fig. 3). Sludge samples from the ICSAB and AGSB had complex bacterial composition, but contained three major bands (bands 4, 5 and 6) representing C. pasteurianum, K. oxytoca and Streptococcus sp., respectively. These three species are similar to those observed in a high-rate H2 producing bioreactor containing silicon-immobilized and self-flocculated sludge [14]. In addition to the well-known H2 producing C. pasteurianum, microorganisms including Streptococcus sp., K. oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, Dialister sp., and Bifidobacterium sp. were also present in the ICSAB sludge, whereas the involvement of those strains in H2 production is still unclear at this moment."
13,Conclusions,"Feeding with glucose-based medium, suspended cultures operated in a CSTR reactor reached its optimal H2 productivity at a HRT of 6h, but H2 production became inefficient when the HRT was shortened to 4h, due mainly to washout of the cells. However, addition of an appropriate amount of immobilized cells (ICSAB system) or granule-stimulating activated carbon carriers (AGSB system) could effectively enhance biomass retention even the reactors were operated at 4h HRT, leading to a marked improvement in H2-producing performance. These results confirm the concept that improving retention of active H2 producers under high substrate loading rate could be a feasible strategy in upgrading the fermentative HPR. Furthermore, results from analysis of bacterial community structure show that the biomass retained in the ICSAB and AGSB reactors were quite similar, while the bacterial community in CSTR (operated at 4h HRT) was very different from that of the two more effective bioreactors. The difference in bacterial community structure seemed to be a good indicator to the community function of H2 production."
