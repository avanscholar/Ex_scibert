0,Introduction,"Presently, transdermal drug delivery has been widely used for topical treatment of skin diseases through absorption of drugs to the circulatory system, which is an alternative to oral drug delivery or hypodermic injection [1, 2]. The advantages of skin drug delivery system are ease of self-administration, pain reduction, metabolism elimination and sustained drug release over a specific period [3]. Therefore, currently, there are many studies focused on the drug delivery system in term of ointments [4], creams [5], gels [6], and patches [7, 8] as well as using natural polymers as carrier matrix [9-11]. However, these forms have several limitations, for example, skin irritation due to the blocking of sweat ducts, difficulty in use with curved surfaces, pain while peeling off, no persistent contact with the skin, and ease of removal by clothes [1]. To overcome these problems, film-forming systems (FFS) provide both semisolid and patch forms, and include high dose flexibility, drug permeation and non-sticky invisible films on the skin [1]. FFS consist of drug, solvent and film-forming polymer [12]. FFS, a non-solid dosage form, can be sprayed or applied on the injured area to form a film in situ, after solvent evaporation, which improves patient compliance [13]. These systems have been used in several applications, including tissue glues for closing incisions [14], disinfection for skin preparation before operation [15], and masking the skin for hydration treatment [16]. For topical drug delivery, FFS with various drugs or bioactive agents, for example, propolis [13], mometasone furoate [17], piperine-rich herbal mixture extract [18], betamethasone valerate [19], and lornoxicam [20] have been reported recently. To create a good film, both non-sticky formulation and minimum drying time are required. Thus, the selection of suitable polymers and solvents is crucial. Hydrophilic (such as Klucel) and hydrophobic (such as Eudragit) polymers are often used for FFS with ethanol as a solvent [19]. Several polymers, including polyvinyl pyrrolidone [21], acrylate copolymers [22], polymethacrylate copolymer [23], ethylcellulose [24], and carboxymethylated gum [13], have been extensively studied, but film based on chitosan is still scarce [25]. Chitosan, a cationic polysaccharide derived from deacetylation of chitin, consists of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and d-glucosamine units. Due to its biocompatibility, film-forming ability, non-toxicity, antibacterial activity, mucoadhesive property, hemocompatibility, and wound-healing acceleration, it has been widely used as a biodegradable material for biomedical applications, e.g., drug delivery, vaccine delivery, antibacterial agent, antitumor activity, and wound healing [26–28]. Chitosan has active amino groups and active hydroxyl groups allowing a variety of chemical modifications to create functional materials with desired properties [29]. A limitation of chitosan in pharmaceutics is its poor water solubility at pH > 6.5, but it is soluble in acid solution [30]. To improve its solubility, many grafted hydrophilic substituents have been explored, for example, gallic acid grafted chitosan conjugate [31], N-quaternary phosphonium chitosan derivatives [32], N-carboxymethylchitosan [33], hydroxyethylacrylchitosan [34, 35], and N-carboxyethylchitosan [36-38]. These modified chitosans improved not only water-solubility, but also other properties, for example, mucoadhesive, antimicrobial activity, antioxidant activity and wound-healing acceleration, which are especially useful in biomedical application [39, 40]. However, chitosan and water-soluble chitosans might not be suitable for FFS because water may take a long time to evaporate and form a film [22]. Recently, chitosans modified with aromatic compounds, have been investigated to improve solubility in organic solvents [41]. Morimoto et al. described the synthesis of phenolic grafted chitosan via the Mannich reaction to obtain chitosan derivatives with good solubility in methanol and 2-methoxymethanol [42]. Shahzad et al. synthesized chitosan derivatives using barbituric acid or thiobarbituric acid. They showed good solubility in various organic solvents, for example, ethanol, methanol, n-hexane, and THF. Moreover, the derivatives exhibited excellent solubility in DMSO and DMF, allowing electrospun nanofibrous fabrication with other commercial polymers soluble in organic solvents [41]. Renbutsu et al. reported the modification of chitosan with photosensitive functional groups by reductive N-alkylation via a Schiff base reaction. Theses derivatives were soluble in DMF and 70% aqueous methacrylic acid [43]. However, there are no reports on FFS prepared from these derivatives. Turmeric is well known as a traditional herbal medicine; it has been used for inflammation, sepsis and wound treatments [44]. Curcumin is an active component of turmeric, which has many biological actions, for example, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, antibacterial, antitumor activities, antiulcer, hypotensive, and hypocholesteremic activities [45, 46]. However, curcumin has low absorption and fast metabolism in the human body, due to its low water-solubility and instability under light, heat, oxygen, enzymes, and highly alkaline conditions [47-49]. Therefore, it is often encapsulated, for example, in micelle systems [50], nanoparticles [51], and cyclodextrin [52, 53], to solve those problems. To reduce production cost and to promote market availability, turmeric extract, containing curcumin, has been suggested to be more potent than the pure curcumin, because other compounds in the crude extract could improve anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities [54]. Hence, encapsulation of turmeric with nanoemulsions [55], lipid carriers [56], polysaccharide carriers [57], and cyclodextrin [58] were also reported. Here, we report the enhancement of chitosan solubility in alcoholic solution for film-forming systems, with β-cyclodextrin encapsulated turmeric extract (CDTE) release. Alcoholic-soluble chitosan derivative was synthesized via reductive amination followed by Michael addition reaction, and structurally characterized by 1H NMR, FT-IR and XRD techniques. The derivative solubilities in alcohol mixtures were measured. The morphology, cytotoxicity, and drug release behavior of films, derived from evaporation of the solvent, were analyzed. Furthermore, film-forming ability was examined in terms of drying time."
1,. Results and discussion,
2,Synthesis and characterization of CBA,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of CBA CBA were successfully synthesized in two steps, reductive amination and then Michael reaction. First, amino groups of chitosan reacted with aldehyde groups of PMB through a Schiff base reaction to form an imine bond. The imine was then reduced with NaBH4 to generate the N-alkylated chitosan (CB) [60]. Second, acrylic acid was added to the amino groups of CB via Michael addition to generate water-soluble CB (CBA) [38]. The complete CBA synthesis is shown in Scheme 1. 3.1.1 FT-IR spectra FT-IR spectra were used to confirm the CBA synthesis products. FT-IR spectra of chitosan, CB and CBA are in Fig. 2 . The chitosan spectrum showed the characteristic 3500–3300 cm−1 band caused by the OH and NH stretchings of the hydroxyl and amino groups. Bands at 2920 and 2870 cm−1 resulted from CH stretching [62]. Bands for C = O stretching at 1646 cm−1 (amide I), NH bending at 1601 cm-1 (amide II) and CN stretching (amide III) at 1323 cm−1 were visible [63]. The peaks at 1423, 1385 and 1073 cm−1 are signals of CH2, CH3 bending and CO stretching, respectively. Compared with the chitosan spectrum, the CB spectrum showed peaks at 1607 and 1515 cm−1, which corresponded to the C = C stretchings of the aromatic ring. The 1248 cm−1 peak was assigned to phenol CO stretching, which confirmed the presence of p-methoxybenzene ring in the chitosan structure. In CBA, new peaks at 1578 and 1402 cm−1 were observed, corresponding to asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibrations of carboxyl groups (-COO−), respectively [64]. Overall, grafting of PMB and acrylic acid to the chitosan backbone was confirmed. 3.1.2 1H NMR spectrum The structures of chitosan, CB and CBA were further confirmed by 1H NMR spectra - see Fig. 3 . The chitosan spectrum had a 1.86 ppm peak, representing the methyl protons in the chitosan acetamide groups. A singlet 3.01 ppm peak and multiplet signals, in the range of 3.43–3.82 ppm, were assigned to H2 of glucosamine units and the non-anomeric protons of chitosan (H3 H6), respectively [65, 66]. New aromatic proton signals at 6.92 (corresponding to H9) and 7.28 ppm (H8) were found in the CB spectrum. The CBA spectrum had characteristic peaks, which were similar to those of CB. The H2 signal was shifted and split to two peaks at 2.46 and 2.59 ppm due to different environments of mono-carboxyethylated and the di-carboxyethylated amines [67]. New peak at 2.26 ppm were assigned to Hb of methylene protons [68]. Thus, chitosan modified with PMB and acrylic acid was confirmed. Considering the degree of deacetylation (%DD) of modified chitosan, 95.7% of CB and 95.3% of CBA was approximated to original chitosan (95.0%), suggesting no changes in %DD during modification. The degrees of substitution (%DS) in CBA were 27.9% for PMB and 33.8% for acrylic acid. 3.1.3 XRD patterns The crystallinities of chitosan, CB and CBA were verified by XRD - see Fig. 4 . The XRD pattern of hydrated chitosan showed three characteristic peaks of 2θ = 10.9° (020), 20.1° (200) and 22.0° (220), typical fingerprints of semi-crystalline chitosan [69]. The reflections at 2θ = 10.9° and 20.1° corresponded to crystal forms I and II, respectively [70]. Compared with pure chitosan, broad XRD was found in CB, while the peak of CBA was rarely observed, corresponding to the decrease in crystallinity index of chitosan (57.91%), CB (39.87%) and CBA (14.87%). This indicated that the two-step modification of chitosan led to impediment of inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bond formation in the chitosan structure, leading, in turn, to an amorphous form [71]. In addition, the results corresponded to the decrease in FT-IR peaks of OH and NH vibrations at 3424 cm−1 of the modified chitosans [72]. 3.1.4 Solubility test Chitosan, CB, and CBA solubility in several media is shown in Table 1. CB was insoluble in water and acetic acid was still required to dissolve it, similar to chitosan. However, CB showed good solubility in acidic alcohol mixtures, while chitosan was not soluble. The aromatic ring in the CB structure helped to improve solubility in alcohol mixtures [42]. CBA showed good water-solubility, caused by the added hydrophilic groups (from the acrylic acid units). Moreover, the CBA exhibited excellent solubility in 50%v/v alcohols (methanol, ethanol or isopropanol) showing that grafting of PMB and acrylic acid on the chitosan backbone improved solubility in alcohol mixtures. Therefore, CBA is a promising candidate natural-based polymer for FFS."
3,Preparation of CBA-TE and CBA-CDTE films,"3.2 Preparation of CBA-TE and CBA-CDTE films To investigate the properties of the film prepared from the CBA-TE and CBA-CDTE forming solutions, CBA-TE and CBA-CDTE films were fabricated by solvent casting at room temperature. The CBA-TE film appeared red, whereas CBA-CDTE film was yellow. The lighter color of the CBA-CDTE film was due to the stable TE encapsulated CD [73]. The morphology of surface area of the films is shown in Fig. 5 . The CBA-TE film surface was rough and not homogeneous, due to the low water solubility of TE, whereas the surface of CBA-CDTE film was smooth without phase separation. The CD encapsulation led to good water solubility, resulting in good compatibility with CBA in aqueous solution, leading to the smoother surface."
4,Cytotoxicity,"3.3 Cytotoxicity The cytotoxicity of CBA, CBA-TE and CBA-CDTE films on HaCaT cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Fig. 6 shows that cell viabilities were 105% for CBA, 87% for CBA-TE and 130% for CBA-CDTE films. The decrease in cell viability of CBA-TE film was attributed to free curcumin in TE, similar to the literature [74]. The CBA-CDTE film obviously increased cell viability, because biocompatibility of CBA and CD led to a suitable environment for cell growth. Thus, we found no cytotoxicity, following ISO 10,993-5 [71]. Therefore, CBA-based films with both TE and CDTE could be safely applied to human subjects."
5,In vitro drug release studies,"3.4 In vitro drug release studies The TE release from CBA-TE and CBA-CDTE films was studied in a PBS solution (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. The cumulative release profiles of both films vs time are shown in Fig. 7 . The release from CBA-CDTE film was reasonably linear: 38.9% was released within 420 min, whereas CBA-TE film had a slower release. After 24 h, cumulative release of CBA-TE film was 43% and CBA-CDTE showed 74%. The CBA-CDTE film released more TE than CBA-TE film, due to the higher water solubility of CDTE [58]. The kinetics of TE release through the CBA matrix (CBA-CDTE) was determined from the release data as shown in Table 2 , which showed followed a first order mechanism (R2=0.9847), i.e., release rate depended on TE concentration. This was due to aqueous solubility of CDTE. On the hand, data for CBA-TE films fitted a Higuchi model (R2=0.9918), indicating slow diffusion of TE from CBA, due to poor aqueous solubility of TE. It also followed a Korsmeyer-Peppas model (R2=0.9802), n slightly above 0.5, indicating an anomalous mechanism (non-Fickian transport), controlled by TE diffusion and slow erosion of CBA. The higher cumulative release from CBA-CDTE film should increase the probability of TE penetrating skin, a desirable characteristic of a drug delivery system."
6,Drying time,"3.5 Drying time Solvent evaporation of film-forming solutions is an important factor for forming thin and transparent films on skin [22]. The drying times of CBA and CBA-CDTE solutions in different ethanol ratios are shown in Fig. 8 a. The drying time of both solutions decreased with increasing ethanol ratios (p < 0.05). CBA and CBA-CDTE dissolved in 50%v/v ethanol had drying time less than 7 min. Moreover, the addition of CDTE in the solution did not significantly affect the drying time, especially at higher ethanol content. Fig. 8b shows the application of CBA and CBA-CDTE solutions (50%v/v ethanol) on a human forearm. Films from both solutions conformed easily to the skin, leaving a thin film that could easily peel off. Moreover, the CBA-based films were easily removed by wiping with ethanol or washing with water. This again confirmed that CDTE-incorporated CBA solutions had a potential for the FFS formulation for drug-release."
