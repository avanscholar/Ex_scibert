0,Introduction,"Selective reduction of substituted nitroarenes is an important reaction to produce functionalized anilines, which are valuable intermediates for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, dyes, and other fine chemicals [1–4]. Nevertheless, when additional one or more reducible groups, such as -CC, -X (X = F, Cl, Br, and I), -CO, -CC, and -CN, are present in the same molecule of a nitroarene, the efficiently selective reduction of -NO2 group still faces huge challenges [5,6]. This is because most catalysts are active for the reduction of both -NO2 group and other reducible groups, and this can yield inevitable by-products [7,8]. So far, great efforts have been made to improve the selectivity of reducing -NO2 group in the nitroarenes that bear other reducible groups. The research on the reduction of nitroarenes has a long history. The earliest method developed by Bechamp in 1854 for the nitro reduction was using an acid and a metal as the reductants, and the reduction of nitro has evolved to less toxic heterogeneously catalytic reaction with better circulation and separability [9]. Catalytic hydrogenation using hydrogen and catalyst is an atomic economic method for the heterogeneous reduction of -NO2 group [10]. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH), using various hydrogen donors (such as HCOOH, NaBH4, NH3·BH3, N2H4·H2O, etc.), is another important heterogeneous -NO2 reduction method, and sometimes the CTH has high selectivity due to the diversity of hydrogen sources. The influence of hydrogen sources on the selective reduction of -NO2 groups cannot be ignored. An example is that Furukawa and co-workers reported RhPb2/SiO2 catalyzed reduction of 4-nitrostyrene [11]. They found when the hydrogen source was methanol, the selectivity to 4-vinylaniline, 4-ethylnitrobenzene and 4-ethylaniline was 93%, 6% and 1% upon 94% conversion, respectively. When the hydrogen source was H2, their selectivity was 91%, 5% and 4% upon 36% conversion, respectively. This illustrates the importance of the hydrogen sources in the selective reduction of -NO2 group. So far, there is no comprehensive comparison and analysis of the natural selectivity of different hydrogen sources. Therefore, the in-depth study of the natural selectivity of hydrogen sources is of great significance of the selective reduction of nitroarenes containing other reducible groups. In addition to the hydrogen sources that present natural selectivity, another key to the selective reduction of -NO2 group is to design and prepare selective catalysts [12–16]. So far, metal catalysts ranging from nanoparticles (NPs) to single atoms have been extensively studied for the selective reduction of nitroarenes that contain other reducible groups. These nanocatalysts cover a very wide scope, including nanocatalysts with mono precious metal component, mono non-precious metal component, binary metal component, and single-atom and nanocluster catalysts. It is worth noting that metal catalysts with good hydrogenation activity (such as Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, or Ni) usually suffer low hydrogenation selectivity of -NO2 groups when one or more additional reducible groups present in the same molecules [17,18]. To date, many techniques have been applied to enhance the selectivity, such as adding suitable additives and modifying active metals [19–22]. However, some of these methods are not conducive to sustainable chemistry, and some improve the selectivity by the expense of activity [23,24]. These are not satisfactory in practical applications. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss highly efficient, selective, and green catalytic protocol for the reduction of nitroarenes containing other reducible groups through systematic review. This review has summarized the recent progress (the recent 10 years, especially recent 5 years) on the selective reduction of nitrostyrene, halogenated nitrobenzene, nitrobenzaldehyde, nitroacetophenone, nitrobenzonitrile, and nitrophenylacetylene to corresponding functionalized anilines by various hydrogen sources and metal catalysts ( Scheme 1). We first carefully discuss five hydrogen sources, hydrogen, sodium borohydride, ammonia borane, formic acid, and hydrazine hydrate, with the aim to uncover the relationship between active hydrogens and catalytic selectivity. We further discuss the key factors that influence the selectivity of metal catalysts for the reduction of nitroarenes. Then we summarize several effective approaches that can improve the selectivity of metal catalysts by reviewing various types of catalysts including nanocatalysts with mono precious or non-precious metal component, binary metal component, and single-atom and nanocluster catalysts. In order to better understand the selectivity, the reaction mechanism of the reduction of nitroarenes to corresponding anilines is also discussed in this review. We hope that this review can help the researchers to further understand the selectivity of the catalytic reduction of nitroarenes to corresponding anilines, especially in the presence of other reducible groups."
1,The understanding of selectivity and mechanism,"In this review, in order to understand selectivity more clearly, we firstly define a few words such as dissociation activation, non-dissociation activation, natural selectivity, intrinsic selectivity, and preferential adsorption. The dissociation of the hydrogen source generates active adsorbed hydrogen (Hads), is named as dissociation activation. On the contrary, the hydrogen source does not dissociate and is directly adsorbed on the catalyst to participate in the reaction, is called non-dissociation activation. For explanation, H2 is usually considered to have to endow dissociation activation in a usual heterogeneously catalytic hydrogenation procedure. Dissociation or non-dissociation activation also happens to other hydrogen sources. Natural selectivity is related to the hydrogen source, that is, the selectivity that the hydrogen source can only react with specific functional groups is called natural selectivity: (1) Under non-catalytic conditions, the hydrogen source can only react with certain functional groups. For example, NaBH4 can react with aldehydes and ketones, but cannot react with non-electron-deficient alkenes; (2) under catalytic conditions, the natural selectivity comes from non-dissociation activation, while dissociation activation of the hydrogen source to generate active hydrogen does not have natural selectivity. Moreover, the intrinsic selectivity is related to the catalyst. Under the same conditions, a catalyst has intrinsic activity to one functional group against another group, that is, the selectivity caused by the intrinsic activity is called intrinsic selectivity. The intrinsic selectivity origins from a catalyst itself, as it shows remarkable difference activity towards different functionality. This is different from the concept of preferential adsorption. When functional groups have competitive adsorption, a certain functional group is preferentially adsorbed on the catalyst to participate a reaction, which is called preferential adsorption, and this also causes selectivity."
2,Effect of active hydrogen from hydrogen sources on selectiviy,"2.1 Effect of active hydrogen from hydrogen sources on selectiviy The selective reduction of nitroarenes with unsaturated groups is affected by hydrogen donors ( Scheme 2). Different from catalytic hydrogenation with H2, catalytic transfer hydrogenation adopts hydrogen donors (such as N2H4·H2O, NaBH4, NH3·BH3, HCOOH, etc.) to react at ambient pressure, and it has been turned out to be an efficient and highly selective methodology in past several years. This stems from the fact that the active hydrogen formed by the hydrogen donor is much easier than dissociating H2, thus enhances the controllability in selective hydrogenation [25]. Activating H2 is a critical step in the catalytic hydrogenation, and the activation of H2 involves homolytic dissociation and heterolytic dissociation [26,27]. The homogeneous dissociation of H2 refers to the formation of two hydrides after the HH bond is cleaved. In this process, the catalyst accepts the σ electrons of H2 and provides d-electrons to its σ* antibonding orbit. The other way to activate H2 is heterolytic dissociation, where H2 is cleaved into H+ and H- under the action of nucleophilic atoms or strong electric field, and H+ will bind to the proton acceptor, then the hydrogenation of polar groups such as -NO2 group occurs [12]. No matter which way the produced active hydrogen is connected to the metal of the catalyst, it has extremely high activity and weak selectivity, and special catalysts are required to achieve selective reduction. Some hydrogen storage materials, include NaBH4 and NH3·BH3, are widely used in catalytic transfer hydrogenation as the H donor. They have many advantages, including high hydrogen content, non-toxicity, stability, and transportation convenience [28]. According to the comparison of electron negativity of H (2.1) and B (2.0), NaBH4 and NH3·BH3 are always regarded as negative hydrogen reagent, which also need the activation of the catalyst to produce active hydrogen. In addition, the generated active hydrogen is connected to the metal, which is similar to the activation of hydrogen [29–31]. This kind of Hads also has no natural selectivity. It relies on the catalyst to achieve chemical selectivity when it participates in the reaction. NaBH4 spontaneously reacts with aldehydes, ketones and electron-deficient olefins in the absence of a catalyst, indicating its natural selectivity. However, they do not reduce the nitro group without a catalyst, and the assistance of catalyst is necessary to achieve selective reduction in the presence of another unsaturated group. Formic acid is also an important liquid hydrogen donor, which is easy to store and transport. The content of hydrogen is 43.8 g H2 kg-1, and can be prepared with biomass and CO2 [32]. When formic acid or formate is used as a hydrogen donor, formyl hydrogen is the active species [33], and protonic hydrogen on the carboxyl group may assist the reaction. Due to the rapid proton exchange in the protic solvents under normal temperature, generally protonic hydrogen of formic acid has weaker hydrogenation reactivity. The reaction pathway of formic acid as hydrogen source is controversial. There is a report that two surface species directly involved in hydrogen transfer, including adsorbed hydrogen and adsorbed formate species [34]. Normally, when formic acid reduces the nitro group, it will produce adsorbed hydrogen atoms and CO2, and then the adsorbed hydrogen will react with the adjacent adsorbed nitro group to generate the corresponding aniline finally [35]. For the other statement, no adsorbed hydrogen atoms are formed, and the adsorbed formate species can directly interact with the nitro group [34], which may can improve the selectivity because of the non-dissociation activation. Therefore, compared with the borohydrides of NaBH4 and NH3·BH3, the formic acid has natural selectivity according to the latter pathway. Similar to formic acid, active hydrogen comes from α-C also has natural selectivity when alcohol as a hydrogen donor [34]. More than described in this review, hydrazine hydrate has the highest natural selectivity towards nitro group among many hydrogen sources, as it can reduce nitroarenes in the absence of a catalyst [36]. And some hydrazine-mediated reductions of nitroarenes are almost instantaneous (several seconds) [37], showing remarkable natural activity of hydrazine. For the CTH using N2H4, a series of reported platinum-based catalysts show higher selectivity than using H2 in reducing o-chloronitrobenzene to o-chloroaniline under complete conversion [38]. For example, 2%Pt/CMK-3-HQ catalyst achieved 100% selectivity using N2H4·H2O, and it achieves 96.2% selectivity using H2. Zou and co-workers reported that 0.5Ru/OMS-IL catalyst could achieve > 99% selectivity for the reduction of 4-methoxynitrobenzene to 4-methoxyaniline using N2H4·H2O as a hydrogen source, while using NaBH4 could only achieve a selectivity of 64% [39]. For different functionalities, even if the reaction time was prolonged or the amount of N2H4·H2O was increased again after the conversion reached 100%, the reported Rh/α-FeOOH catalyst could still achieve 97% selectivity for the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene to 3-aminostyrene [24]. More than the natural selectivity towards nitroarenes, N2H4·H2O has high content of hydrogen (7.9%) and by-products greenness of only N2 and water [40]. The decomposition of hydrazine proceeds by two typical routes: H2NNH2→N2 + 2H2 (1); 3H2NNH2→4NH3 + N2 (2). Wang and co-workers proved that the dominant catalytic decomposition method of N2H4·H2O is the reaction (2) [41]. Nevertheless, the prefer pathway of hydrazine activation is (1), which produces four active hydrogens that have excellent activity. In some cases, hydrazine can be quantitatively used as the hydrogen source for hydrogenation of -NO2 group [42,43]. This implies that the cleavage of the N-N bond of N2H4·H2O does not occur in this reaction. The molecular N2H4 is simultaneously adsorbed with the -NO2 on the catalyst to form a complex intermediate, which undergoes the hydrogen transfer reaction. This mode of action is completely different from hydrogen [38], which could be why the hydrazine hydrate has extremely high selectivity. Here, the characteristics of the reaction between various hydrogen sources and different unsaturated functional groups are summarized in Table 1 [44]. When H2 is used as a hydrogen source, the hydrogenation of various reducible groups (-NO2, -CC, -X, -CO, -CC, and -CN) requires the presence of a catalyst, which implies the poor natural selectivity of H2. Unlike hydrogen, the reaction of other hydrogen sources with various reducible groups has more complex characteristics. For example, the N2H4·H2O and -NO2 undergo a catalytic reaction, but it hardly reacts with -CC even in the presence of a catalyst. This shows that N2H4·H2O has a natural selectivity for reducing -NO2 instead of -CC group, which can lead to excellent selectivity for reducing nitrostyrene to aminostyrene. Moreover, N2H4·H2O will cause a substitution reaction with halo atomic group (-X). It also reacts with -CO and -CN groups to generate hydrazone and multiple products, respectively. HCOOH reacts catalytically with -NO2, -CO, and -CN groups, but it does not react with -CC and -X groups. NaBH4 and NH3·BH3 have similar reaction characteristics in the reaction of reducible groups. They react catalytically with -NO2, -X and -CN groups, but spontaneously react with -CO group even in the absence of a catalyst. Moreover, NaBH4 reacts non-catalytically with electron-deficient CC bond such as nitroalkenes, but for electron-rich CC bond the presence of a catalyst is necessary. Isopropanol reacts catalytically with -NO2 and -CN groups but does not react with -CC and -X groups. In addition, it also has a catalytic reaction with -CO group through Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reaction. LiAlH4 has natural activity for reducing various hydrogen sources, that is, they can react without participation of any catalyst. In summary, N2H4·H2O has four highly selective protonated active hydrogens, HCOOH has a similar protic hydrogen and a highly active hydrogen on α-C. H2, NH3·BH3 and NaBH4 do not have free protonated active hydrogen, but the active hydrogen that obtained after the cleavage of HH bond or BH has extremely high activity, then the selectivity may become weaker. Combined with the experimental results of various literatures, we can render such a blueprint about the selectivity sequence for diverse hydrogen sources: In some cases, the more protonic active hydrogen in the molecule, the better its natural selectivity towards nitro group reduction. From this view, the natural selectivity for the usual hydrogen sources is N2H4·H2O > HCOOH > NaBH4, NH3·BH3 > H2."
3,Effect of metal component in nanocatalysts on selectivity,"2.2 Effect of metal component in nanocatalysts on selectivity The selectivity of the reduction of nitroarenes containing other reducible groups over metal catalysts is influenced by two crucial factors: intrinsic selectivity and preferential adsorption ( Scheme 3). Generally, three typical methods including kinetic experiments, IR spectra and DFT calculations are used to reveal the origin of selectivity [45]. In order to illustrate the selective reduction of -NO2 group in the presence of other reducible groups, we summarize two cases here. In the first case, the catalysts are active for the hydrogenation of -NO2 group and other reducible groups, but the hydrogenation of other reducible groups can be suppressed by the -NO2 group, which can be preferentially adsorbed on the catalysts. For instance, in 2007, the high chemoselectivity over the classic Au/TiO2 catalyst was attributed to both the factors, the higher intrinsic activity for -NO2 group than -CC and the preferential adsorption of -NO2 group [45]. When a mixture of nitrobenzene and styrene was employed in a hydrogenation reaction, the hydrogenation of styrene was severely suppressed, but nitrobenzene was hardly affected. A similar situation can also be found on the single-atom catalyst (SAC), 0.08%Pt/FeOx-R200, which was reported in 2014 [5]. In contrast, this work also reported that the pseudo-SAC 0.08%Pt/FeOx-R250 had a slightly lower intrinsic activity on hydrogenating -NO2 group regarding -CC group. However, this catalyst could also obtain a high selectivity to 3-vinylaniline by preferentially adsorbing -NO2 group. Moreover, when nitrobenzene and styrene coexisted in the reaction, the two catalysts had a similar situation, that is, the hydrogenation activity of styrene was significantly decreased and that of nitrobenzene was slightly increased, which reflects the importance of preferential adsorption to improve catalytic selectivity. Furthermore, in 2018, by means of DFT calculations, Zou and co-workers predicted that the -NO2 group of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde was preferentially adsorbed on P-doped carbon surface, and the adsorption on Ni2P nanoclusters was inhibited due to the geometrical hindrance, which resulted in excellent selectivity of nitro-reduction [8]. Moreover, in 2019, the reported 2% Pt/CMK-3 and 2% Pt/CMK-3-HQ catalysts could produce a certain amount of benzene in the dechlorination reaction of chlorobenzene [38]. However, when a mixture of chlorobenzene and nitrobenzene was reduced, the dechlorination activity of 2% Pt/CMK-3 catalyst decreased dramatically and that of 2% Pt/CMK-3-HQ catalyst was completely suppressed. This showed the competitive adsorption between -NO2 group and -Cl group, and the catalysts favored the adsorption of -NO2 group. In the second case, the catalysts are active for -NO2 group only and inert regarding other reducible groups. In another words, the excellent selectivity is entirely derived from the intrinsic activity of hydrogenating -NO2 group. As Zhang and co-workers reported in 2017, there was no competitive adsorption and activation of -NO2 and -CC group on the surface of the reported Au25/ZnAl-HT-300 catalyst. It only activated and adsorbed -NO2 group instead of -CC group [7]. To achieve high intrinsic selectivity for hydrogenating -NO2 group and preferential adsorption of -NO2 group, it requires rational design and regulation of nanocatalysts. A generally accepted cognition is that different metals have different intrinsic activities, and metal catalysts with good hydrogenation activity generally suffer low selectivity for reduction of -NO2 group with other reducible groups [18]. It is possible to convert non-selective metal catalysts into highly selective ones by controlling and modifying the geometric and electronic structure of the active sites, thus to determine the adsorption strength and manner of a substrate [12,46]. Therefore, many approaches have been reported to fabricate metal catalysts to improve selectivity, including adjustment of the metal-support interactions, confinement of metals in the pores of the supports, modification of metals with non-metallic elements (N, S, P, etc.), construction of bimetallic alloys or intermetallics, formation of single-atom catalysts, and so on."
4,Mechanism,"2.3 Mechanism The reaction mechanism of reducing nitroarenes to the amines proposed by Haber is widely accepted ( Scheme 4) [47]. This mechanism mainly includes two different routes, which are single molecule route and double molecule route. In both routes, the -NO2 group is first quickly reduced to nitroso. In the single molecule route, or direct route, the nitroso is further hydrogenated to the corresponding hydroxylamine, which is also a relatively fast process. But reducing the hydroxylamine needs to cleavage NO bond, and the process of reducing the hydroxylamine to the amino group is slow. This will accumulate hydroxylamine in the reaction process if the catalytic activity is not very high, and lead to an increase in by-products. Another route is the formation of azoxy compounds through the condensation of nitroso and hydroxylamine, which will be reduced to the azo, hydrazo, and aniline compounds in a series of successive steps. The condensation route needs to be carried out under alkaline conditions. The mechanisms of nitroarenes reduction over many metal catalysts belong to the above two types. For example, the reported Co–Mo2C/AC [48] and Pd1/GDY/G [49] catalysts follow the direct route, while the Pd/Fe3O4@C [50] catalyst follow the condensation route. It is worth noting that there is another type in the direct route, which is the direct reduction of nitrobenzene to phenylhydroxylamine without the intermediary of nitrosobenzene. For example, Corma and co-workers reported an Au/TiO2 catalyst [51], and they found that this catalyst using nitrobenzene as a reactant could produce more phenylhydroxyamine than using nitrosobenzene. This indicates that the direct reduction of nitrobenzene to phenylhydroxylamine is the primary product, while the phenylhydroxyamine obtained from nitrosobenzene as a reactant is a secondary product. Similarly, the Pt/RGO-EG catalyst reported by Hou and co-workers also follows this direct route [52]. In addition, different from the above-mentioned mechanism, Lin and co-workers systematically studied the reduction mechanism of nitrobenzene on the Pt (111) model catalyst through DFT calculations [53]. The results show that the reaction barrier of double H-induced dissociation of N-O bond is much lower than that of direct dissociation and single H-induced dissociation. This indicates that the double H-induced dissociation path of the NO bond is preferential, and the corresponding reduction mechanism of nitrobenzene is as follows: C6H5NO2*→C6H5NOOH*→ C6H5N(OH)2*→C6H5NOH*→C6H5NHOH*→C6H5NH*→C6H5NH2*. Similarly, the reported Fe1/N-C [54] and Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-FeCu NPs [55] catalysts also agree this mechanism. The production of intermediates is affected by the surrounding environment, so the route of -NO2 group reduction is determined by the external conditions. For the selectively hydrogenating nitroarenes to the anilines, the intermediate products may become a sort of by-products. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the reaction route and optimize the experimental conditions to obtain higher selectivity. In addition, understanding the deactivation mechanism is also very important for the nitro reduction reaction. Generally, the deactivation of precious metal catalysts can be mainly attributed to the leaching or agglomeration of active sites [42]. However, the deactivation of non-precious metal catalysts is not only related to these reasons, but also related to changes in crystallinity [56]."
5,Chemoselective reduction of nitrostyrene,"Selective hydrogenation of -NO2 group on nitrostyrene is a particular challenge compared to the nitroarenes with other reducible groups, and this is because hydrogenation of -CC group is kinetically and thermodynamically more favored than that of -NO2 group [57]. Furthermore, selective hydrogenation of nitrostyrene is usually used as a model reaction to evaluate the selectivity of the studied catalysts [58]. Nanocatalysts including single atoms and nanoclusters have been widely studied for the selective reduction of nitrostyrene, and many catalysts are active for both groups that coexists in the nitrostyrene. This generally leads to simultaneous reduction of -NO2 and -CC groups, which lowers the selectivity. Therefore, it is necessary to design and adjust the metal catalysts so that they can have high intrinsic selectivity for hydrogenating -NO2 group and/or preferential adsorption of -NO2 group. Moreover, the hydrogen sources also have a huge impact on the selectivity of reducing nitrostyrene. In the following sections, we will mainly review the recent nanocatalysts using different hydrogen donors for the selective reduction of nitrostyrene, which are summarized in Table 2."
6,Catalytic hydrogenation with H2,"3.1 Catalytic hydrogenation with H2 3.1.1 Nanocatalysts with mono precious metal component Precious metal catalysts often exhibit high catalytic activity but poor selectivity for the catalytic reduction of nitrostyrenes. In order to achieve high selectivity, the two key factors of high intrinsic selectivity and preferential adsorption were very important. Therefore, many studies have been devoted to this. Corma and co-workers prepared Au/TiO2 catalyst, which exhibited high selectivity to 3-vinylaniline by utilizing a cooperative effect between Au nanoparticle and the support [45]. They found that the catalyst 1.5 wt% Au/TiO2 was more selective than 2 wt% Pt/TiO2 and 2 wt% Pd/TiO2 catalysts when the hydrogenation of nitrostyrene reached near full conversion. Kinetic experiments showed that the reaction rate of Au/TiO2 catalyst for hydrogenating nitrobenzene was much higher than styrene, and this confirmed that Au/TiO2 catalyst had higher intrinsic activity for hydrogenating -NO2 group than -CC group. When nitrobenzene and styrene coexist in the reaction, the activity of hydrogenating styrene was significantly suppressed, but the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene was not affected. This was also because of the competitive adsorption between -NO2 and -CC groups. The -NO2 group was preferentially adsorbed on Au/TiO2 catalyst, and this result was supported by both kinetics and FTIR measurement. They also reported that the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between metals and the reducible support TiO2 can improve selectivity [18]. For example, the catalysts, Au/TiO2, Pt/TiO2, Ni/TiO2, and Ru/TiO2 for the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene to 3-vinylaniline showed good selectivity of 95.9%, 93.1%, 90.2%, and 96.3%, respectively. In another case, the synergistic effect between Au nanoparticles and boronate support also demonstrated excellent selectivity to hydrogenate -NO2 group and completely inhibited the reduction of -CC groups [59]. Another precious metal platinum originally has higher activity on hydrogenating alkenes than -NO2 group [17]. Modifying platinum by introducing other species or changing the supports can increase the selectivity to the target vinylaniline [63]. Van Bokhoven and co-workers used organic thiols to modify the surface of Pt/TiO2 catalysts for controlling selectivity to vinylaniline [60]. Their kinetic measurement results showed that 4-ethylnitrobenzene was first generated over the unmodified Pt/TiO2 catalyst, and the concentration of 4-ethylnitrobenzene was always greater than the 4-ethylaniline from the beginning to the complete conversion. However, the yield of 4-vinylaniline using the modified Pt/TiO2 catalyst was close to 100%. Obviously, modifying the catalyst surface with organic thiols inhibited the intrinsic activity of hydrogenating -CC group then improves the selectivity to -NO2 group. Encapsulating precious metal nanoparticles in the interior of the supports is also a way to increase the selectivity of hydrogenating nitrostyrene to vinylaniline. Ding and co-workers found that the Pt@MFI catalyst showed 80% selectivity for 4-vinylaniline, whereas the impregnated Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst only got 4-ethylaniline at full conversion, and this may be because the Pt@MFI catalyst exposed a specific domain of Pt in favor of improving selectivity to vinylaniline [61]. In addition to platinum catalysts, other precious metal catalysts such as rhodium, ruthenium and palladium also displayed low selectivity for hydrogenation of -NO2 group in nitrostyrene [17,18]. It is reported that by controlling the coordination of the metal surface atoms and building a synergistic effect between the metal and the appropriately support, the selectivity of the metal catalyst can be changed [18]. Tamura and co-workers systematically studied the effect of different metal oxides modified various precious metals on the selective hydrogenation of nitrostyrene [17]. They found that the MoOx-modified Ru/SiO2 catalyst showed high activity and selectivity by producing active sites at the interface of precious metals and metal oxides. Through a comparative test that nitrobenzene and styrene were mixed, the activity of hydrogenating -NO2 group did not change, but hydrogenating -CC group was completely inhibited by -NO2 group. This explained the high selectivity of 3-vinylaniline. Similarly, Ag nanoparticles supported on TiO2-modified silica could achieve 97% selectivity on the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene to 3-vinylaniline under complete conversion [62]. Interestingly, the selectivity of nitrostyrene hydrogenation can be flexibly converted, and the products are vinylaniline and ethylnitrobenzene, respectively. Zhang and co-workers reported that Pt/C catalysts obtained through low-temperature reduction treatment can selectively hydrogenate the -CC, while high-temperature reduction treatment gave the selective catalyst for the reduction of -NO2 groups of nitrostyrene [58]. They found that surface oxygen-containing groups and heteroatom P species played important roles in the selectivity switching. Similarly, Beier and co-workers reported that 3-ethylnitrobenzene could be obtained by ionic liquid-supported Pt nanoparticles under acidic condition, while under basic conditions the product is 3-vinylaniline [63]. The hydrogenation of -CC group with good selectivity in nitrostyrene maintaining inertness to -NO2 group was also a huge challenge. The modification methods of precious metal catalysts have been developed to hydrogenate nitrostyrene to ethylnitrobenzene with high selectivity, such as the controlling crystallinity of palladium nanosheets [64] and introducing SMSI between Pd species with defective hollow nanocarbons [65]. Porous organic polymers are often used to stabilize metal nanoparticles because of their large surface areas and excellent stability, and the resulted catalysts usually exhibit high selectivity to ethylnitrobenzene [66]. It is worth noting that the Pt-POP catalyst modified with sulfonic acid group could reverse the selectivity to vinylaniline prefer, and this was because the sulfonic acids partially blocked the surfaces of the platinum site [67]. 3.1.2 Nanocatalysts with mono non-precious metal component Unlike precious metals, non-precious metal catalysts have low intrinsic activity for catalytic hydrogenation of nitro compounds, so they generally require higher hydrogen pressure [95–97]. The abundance and low price make the non-precious metals more valuable as the catalysts, and elemental modification using N, S and P is available for improving their activity and selectivity. The development of highly effective non-precious metal catalysts for selective hydrogenation of nitrostyrenes has practical significance [98,99]. Recently, the M−N−C catalysts have attracted a lot of interest on selectively hydrogenating nitrostyrene to vinylaniline, and they are often synthesized by pyrolyzing a blend of metal, nitrogen and carbon precursors under the protection of inert gas [12]. The M−N sites are generally the active sites of this type of catalysts, and they can improve the preferential adsorption and activation of -NO2 group by modifying the electronic structure of metals [100,101]. Wu and co-workers prepared the Co@Co-N-C@SBA-15 catalyst with the Co-N sites as the intrinsic active sites for hydrogenating -NO2 group of 4-nitrostyrene [1]. Through ATR-FTIR measurement results, they found that the Co−N sites can better adsorb -NO2 group instead of -CC group due to the strong interaction. When hydrogenating nitrobenzene and styrene separately, this catalyst can achieve 100% conversion for -NO2 group but only 6% for -CC group, and this proves that the Co-N sites has high intrinsic activity for hydrogenating -NO2 instead of -CC group. When nitrobenzene and styrene were mixed, nitrobenzene was still completely converted, but the conversion of styrene stopped. This indicates the Co-N-C type catalysts contribute selectivity mainly because of the intrinsic selectivity towards NO2 rather than -CC, while preferential adsorption also works. A similar situation can be found on the MOF-derived Co-based catalysts, which was reported by Li and co-workers [68]. They claimed that the Co-N centers of this catalyst promotes the preferential adsorption of -NO2 group. This leads to the high selectivity of hydrogenating 4-nitrostyrene to 4-vinylaniline. Metal sulfides (MS2, M = Fe, Co, Ni, and W) have also been applied to selectively hydrogenate nitrostyrene [19,69]. Wang and co-workers prepared a porous carbon supported CoS2 catalyst (CoS2/PC) with terdentate and tetrahedral coordinated Co atoms (Co3–Co4) as “synergic active site pair”, which exhibited excellent conversion and selectivity for hydrogenating nitrostyrene to vinylaniline ( Fig. 1) [19]. In addition, they found that the CoS2/PC catalyst had higher catalytic performance than FeS2/PC and NiS2/PC. Although FeS2/PC catalyst also exhibited 99% selectivity, it takes longer time to reach full conversion. Controlling experiments revealed that this catalyst had higher intrinsic activity for hydrogenation of -NO2 group, which further proved the importance of intrinsic selectivity. When the two reactants were mixed, the conversion of nitrobenzene did not change but the conversion of styrene was completely suppressed. The DFT computation results showed that the -NO2 group on the catalyst has a greater E ads than that of -CC group, which indicated that the catalyst preferentially adsorbs the -NO2 group. The above results indicate that intrinsic selectivity and preferential adsorption sometimes appear concomitantly. Even if intrinsic selectivity contributes mostly, the preferential adsorption has effect on improving selectivity. Moreover, Schaak and co-workers reported that the colloidally synthesized 2H-WS2 nanostructures also showed outstanding catalytic performance (> 99% conversion and 98% selectivity) for hydrogenating 3-nitrostyrene to 3-vinylaniline with 50 bar of H2 [69]. The Ni2P has been widely used in the catalytic hydrogenation because it has a platinum-like electronic structure [102–104]. Zou and co-workers prepared the SPhF-Ni2P catalyst by Ni2P chelated with p-Fluorothiophenol (SPhF) arrays for selectively hydrogenating 3-nitrostyrene [57]. Both steric effect and d-band center of this catalyst are responsible for good activity and selectivity to 3-vinylaniline. 3.1.3 Nanocatalysts with binary metal component The construction of bimetallic catalysts is also a common means for improving the selectivity of hydrogenating nitrostyrene. The introduction of a second metal can generally lead to rearrangement of the metal surface and even the dilution of each component [105]. The environmental change of the metal atoms alternates the geometric and electronic structure of the active sites, which makes bimetallic catalysts have higher catalytic performance than the corresponding monometallic catalysts. The metal–support interactions formed by supporting the bimetal on the reducible metal oxide will significantly improve the performance of catalytic hydrogenation [106]. Especially, some bimetallic catalysts can achieve high selectivity to vinylaniline at atmospheric H2 pressure compared to other types of catalysts, and this can avoid the use of danger high-pressure hydrogen. For example, Li and co-workers synthesized a dumbbell-shaped Co-Ru nanocatalyst for selectively hydrogenating 4-nitrostyrene to 4-vinylaniline with a H2 balloon ( Fig. 2) [70]. They found that the introduction of Co atoms to compress the lattice strain of Ru could reasonably control the selectivity of this catalyst. Introducing less or more Co content would be detrimental to the selectivity, while Ru with 3% lattice compression (Co0.23-Ru0.77) showed the best selectivity (99%). Furthermore, DFT calculations proved that the optimized lateral compressive strain promoted reduction of -NO2 group and inhibited hydrogenation of -CC group. The reported RhIn/SiO2 and Pt-Sn/H-MoOx catalysts also hydrogenated nitrostyrene under 1 atm H2. As one important sort of the alloys, intermetallic compounds have ordered atoms and specific crystal structure, which are suitable for the study of reaction mechanisms [71]. Furukawa and co-workers synthesized many Rh-based ordered alloys (RhxMy/SiO2; M = Bi, Fe, Ga, Ge, In, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, or Zn) and compared the hydrogenation performance of these alloy catalysts [21]. They found that RhIn/SiO2 catalyst showed the best selectivity. The kinetic study and DFT calculations showed that this high selectivity came from facilitating the adsorption of -NO2 group rather than -CC group by the control of the molecule recognition. Moreover, Gao and co-workers reported that the metal-support interactions between bimetallic Pt-Sn and H-MoOx promoted the efficient conversion of ultrafine nanoparticles, and this was beneficial to the improvement of catalytic performance [6]. The atom-rearranged bimetallic Pt-Sn surface was responsible for the increased selectivity due to the preferential adsorption of -NO2 group on 4-nitrostyrene. A similar situation could also be found on the PtSn@mSiO2 catalyst prepared by Huang and co-workers [71]. The good selectivity of this catalyst was also attributed to the preferential adsorption of -NO2 group on the intermetallic PtSn surface. The above results indicate that the preferential adsorption of -NO2 group on bimetallic catalysts is very important for improving the selectivity of hydrogenating nitrostyrene. Other non-precious metal elements (Bi, Co, and Zn) have been also introduced to Pt catalyst to increase its selectivity [72–75]. The Pt-Bi/TiO2 catalyst prepared by Cheng and co-workers exhibited high intrinsic activity for hydrogenating -NO2 group [72]. With the introduction of Bi, more low coordinated sites of Pt were formed to help the preferential adsorption of -NO2 group. Again, preferential adsorption of -NO2 group could also occur at the Pt–POx interface layer, and this led to a good selectivity of the Co/Pt/PAC catalyst [73]. Kiwi-Minsker and co-workers reported that their Pt/ZnO catalyst exhibited superior catalytic activity and selectivity for hydrogenating 3-nitrostyrene to 3-vinylaniline. This was benefited from the intermetallic Pt/Zn active phase produced by the reaction of metal-support interaction [74]. They also found that H2 partial pressure (2-15 bar) did not significantly affect the selectivity of the catalyst, but its activity increased with increasing H2 pressure. In a further research, they also reported that a porous polymeric matrix could properly control the size of bimetallic Pt–Zn nanoparticles [75]. The synthesized catalyst had offered a yield of 97% for hydrogenating 3-nitrostyrene to produce 3-vinylaniline. This was attributed to the introduction of Zn that modified the surface and electronic structure of Pt. The synergistic effect between two metals has an important effect on the selective hydrogenation of -NO2 group in nitrostyrene, such as IrFe [76], AuNi [77], and NiSn [78]. Ni is active for hydrogenating nitroarenes, but it suffers from low selectivity with other reducible groups [79]. Shimazu and co-workers found that the introduction of electropositive Sn into Ni enhanced the selectivity of hydrogenating -NO2 group [78]. It is worth noting that some bimetallic catalysts could also favored the hydrogenation of -CC group. Zeng and co-workers found that Cu-Pd alloy nanocrystals with the unique concave structure exhibited excellent selectivity for the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene at atmospheric H2 pressure, and it almost worked for only -CC group rather than -NO2 group [80]. Moreover, they also prepared an Rh-doped Pd nanocubes, and it showed enhanced hydrogenation activity compared to the Pd nanocubes under 1 atm of H2 due to the strengthened adsorption of 3-nitrostyrene [81]. Simultaneously, it also improved the selectivity of 3-ethylnitrobenzene, and this was because that the unique adsorption configuration suppressed the activation of -NO2 group. 3.1.4 Single-atom and nanocluster catalysts Unlike metal nanoparticles, single atoms and nanoclusters have different geometric and electronic properties [107], and the corresponding catalysts have been reported to exhibit outstanding catalytic performance for selectively hydrogenating nitrostyrene. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have a proprietary atomic dispersibility of active metals, and some of them exhibit good selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation without sacrificing the intrinsic activity [108,109]. Zhang and co-workers reported that FeOx-supported platinum single-atom and pseudo-single-atom catalysts (pseudo-SAC) exhibited ultra-high catalytic activity for the selective hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene, which represented the best result in contemporary literatures [5]. Here, the pseudo-single-atom structure consists of several to tens of atoms, which is similar to the structure and function of isolated single atoms. These atoms are loosely and randomly combined with each other, and strong PtPt metal bonds are not formed. At the same time, the excellent selectivity to 3-vinylaniline could also be obtained with close to 99%. The excellent property was attributed to the presence of positively charged Pt centers and the absence of PtPt metallic bonding, and they facilitated the preferential adsorption of -NO2 group. Moreover, the control experiment showed that the SAC 0.08%Pt/FeOx-R200 and the pseudo-SAC 0.08%Pt/FeOx-R250 exhibited different intrinsic activities. When hydrogenating styrene and nitrobenzene separately, the SAC exhibited higher intrinsic activity for hydrogenating nitrobenzene, but the pseudo-SAC showed similar hydrogenation activity for the two reactions due to the clustering of Pt single atoms or the generation of PtFe metal bonds. They further used the pseudo-SAC Pt/FeOx catalyst to hydrogenate 3-nitrostyrene in CO2-expanded toluene [110]. They found that this catalyst still exhibited high conversion and superior selectivity, and the amount of toluene could be reduced by 90% compared to previous studies. Moreover, single atoms are prone to aggregation with increasing metal loading. This will result in low catalyst selectivity. To overcome this problem, Zhang’s group introduced alkali metals to modify non-selective high loading Pt/FeOx catalyst. The catalyst, 5% Na–2.16% Pt/FeOx, showed the best selectivity while its activity almost did not change [23]. Characterizations revealed that the active site of a Pt-O-Na-O-Fe-like species provided the isolated and positively charged Pt centers for the preferential adsorption of the -NO2 group, and the control experiments demonstrated that this active site had a higher intrinsic selectivity for hydrogenating -NO2 group towards -CC group. Anchoring single atoms on some supports to lower the energy barriers then enhance catalytic activity and selectivity is a satisfactory strategy. Li and co-workers prepared a Pt1/Ni nanocrystals catalyst by incorporating Pt single atoms in the surface of Ni nanocrystals for the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene under 3 atm of H2 [82]. This catalyst showed a higher turnover frequency (TOF, ～1800 h-1), better than other supports of active carbon, TiO2, SiO2, and ZSM-5. Such a catalyst provided adequate Hads due to the spontaneous dissociation of hydrogen and easy diffusion on Pt1/Ni nanocrystals. At the same time, excellent selectivity was attributed to the favorable adsorption configuration of 3-nitrostyrene for the hydrogenation of -NO2 group. Recently, thiolated Au25 nanoclusters have been used to prepare highly efficient gold catalysts, which was applied to selective hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene due to its small and uniform size. Zhang and co-workers synthesized Au25/ZnAl-HT-x catalysts (x represents the calcination temperature) [7]. They found that Au25/ZnAl-HT-300 catalyst had outstanding selectivity to 3-vinylaniline (≥ 99%) after the substrate was completely converted. In particular, the > 98% selectivity could be achieved in a wide range of reaction time and temperature. Previous research results showed that -NO2 and -CC group could be competitively adsorbed and activated in their catalytic systems, and the -CC group would be reduced in sequence when the -NO2 group was mostly converted. However, the results of the control experiments and attenuated total reflection infrared spectra indicated that there was no competitive activation and adsorption on this catalyst surface, as it only activated and adsorbed -NO2 group. This indicated the intrinsic selectivity for the hydrogenation of -NO2 group against -CC group. For understanding the intrinsic origin of the excellent selectivity of this catalyst, they further studied the effect of the M2+ of the hydrotalcite (MAl-HT; M = Mg, Zn, Ni) on the Au25/MAl-HT-300 catalyst [83]. They found that Au25/ZnAl-HT-300 catalyst exhibited the highest selectivity while Au25/NiAl-HT-300 catalyst had best activity. Characterization results indicated that Ni could be easily reduced due to the close interaction with Au, and this promoted the high reactivity and excessive hydrogenation of Au25/NiAl-HT-300 catalyst. In addition, Au25/NiAl-HT-300 catalyst followed both the condensation route and the direct route of the reduction of nitro, but the other two catalysts only followed the condensation route. In another work, Shimizu and co-workers prepared the silver clusters catalyst supported on Al2O3 for selectively hydrogenating 4-nitrostyrene, and the catalyst exhibited superior catalytic performance [3]. They found that the small silver particle size favored the increased intrinsic activity, and the acid-base bifunctional supports could provide better catalytic activity. The H+/H- pair produced at metal/support interface could be preferentially transferred to the polar bond of the nitro group, and this resulted high selectivity for 4-vinylaniline. Moreover, this catalyst could preferentially adsorb -NO2 group, then had higher reaction rate for hydrogenating -NO2 group than -CC."
7,Transfer hydrogenation with NH3·BH3 by various catalysts,"3.2 Transfer hydrogenation with NH3·BH3 by various catalysts 3.2.1 Precious metal nanocatalysts Ammonia borane (NH3·BH3) as a hydrogen donor has received attention on selectively hydrogenating nitrostyrene because of its high hydrogen storage capacity and long-term stability [111]. Nano metal catalyst usually works for the reduction of nitro with NH3·BH3. For enhancing the catalytic selectivity of metal catalysts, chemical modification is an efficient method, which can adjust the electronic states and steric environment [112,113]. Song and co-workers synthesized the porous multishell Au via the in-situ surface modification of poly(sodium-p-styrenesulfonate) [84]. In NH3·BH3-initiated hydrogenation of 4-nitrostyrene to 4-aminostyrene, the porous triple-shell Au with surface modification showed higher selectivity (97%) than unmodified Au, but lower activity upon complete conversion due to the poisonous effect of the sulfhydryl group in reducing poly(sodium-p-styrenesulfonate). To further understand the selectivity, these two catalysts were used to hydrogenate the mixture of nitrobenzene and styrene using NH3·BH3 as the reducing reagent. They found that unmodified Au catalyst was active for reducing -NO2 group and -CC group, but the surface-modified Au catalyst only activated -NO2 group. Moreover, this excellent selectivity may be attributed to the influence of the transfer of polarized hydrogen to -CC group through modification of sulfhydryl species on Au surface. Yamashita and co-workers reported that mesoporous silica supported Pd/Ag bimetallic nanoparticles catalyst was used for the selective catalytic reduction of 4-nitrostyrene to 4-vinylaniline using NH3·BH3 [85]. They found that the catalyst showed improved selectivity under visible light irradiation. This could be attributed to the efficient adsorption and transfer of H+/H- pair to the polar bonds in the -NO2 group. Moreover, this reason was also responsible for the superior selectivity to 4-vinylaniline obtained by another catalyst Ag/CeO2(2.0)/SBA-15 that they reported [86]. 3.2.2 Non-precious metal nanocatalysts Recently, non-precious metal nanocatalysts using NH3·BH3 for selective reduction of nitrostyrene have also attracted much attention. Sun and co-workers reported that Cu NPs were used as a non-precious metal catalyst to selectively hydrogenate 3-nitrostyrene to 3-vinylaniline using NH3·BH3 at ambient conditions ( Fig. 3a and b) [87]. Among three different Cu nanoparticle catalysts, the Cu/WO2.72 catalyst showed > 99% selectivity to 3-vinylaniline and 100% conversion within 1.5 h, while Cu/SiO2 and Cu/C catalysts also showed superior selectivity (98% and 95%, respectively) after a longer reaction time. Moreover, they performed these three Cu catalysts for the reduction of a mixture of nitrobenzene and styrene using NH3·BH3 as a reductant. They found that all the three catalysts exhibited activity and selectivity for reducing -NO2 group, but the reduction of -CC group hardly occurred, which indicated that the Cu nanoparticles only activated -NO2 group instead of -CC group. This excellent ability of Cu particles can also be found in the catalytic system reported by Yue and co-workers [88]. Their Sm2Co17/Cux (x = 0.1, 0.2) catalysts showed excellent yield (98%) and selectivity (99%) on selectively hydrogenated 3-nitrostyrene to 3-vinylaniline under ultrasonic concussion."
8,N2H4·H2O mediated selective reduction of nitrostyrene,"3.3 N2H4·H2O mediated selective reduction of nitrostyrene 3.3.1 Single metal nanocatalysts N2H4·H2O is also regarded as a “green” hydrogen source for the selective reduction of nitrostyrene because its by-products are only N2 and H2O [114]. Sun and co-workers used a flower-like Rh/α-FeOOH catalyst with N2H4·H2O as a hydrogen source to selectively reduce nitrostyrenes to vinylanilines under complete conversion (Fig. 3c and d) [24]. They found that this catalyst not only showed 100% conversion and 98% selectivity for the reduction of ortho-, meta-, and para-vinyl nitrobenzenes, but also exhibited excellent catalytic performance on selectively reducing multi-substituted nitrostyrenes to corresponding vinylanilines. The controlling experiments and FT-IR analysis demonstrated that this catalyst had high intrinsic activity for reducing -NO2 group and was almost inert to -CC group in the presence of N2H4·H2O, which caused high selectivity. Doris and co-workers reported that different solvents can cause different selective transformation [89]. They synthesized a nanohybrid assembled by ruthenium nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes, and it could be used to selectively reduce 3-nitrostyrene by activating N2H4·H2O at room temperature. The 3-nitrostyrene could be reduced to 3-vinylaniline with 97% yield when using water as a solvent, but the corresponding hydroxylamine could be obtained with 95% yield in THF. It is worth noting that no matter which product is, the -CC group of 3-nitrostyrene is hardly reduced. In addition to precious metal catalysts, non-precious metal catalysts have also been applied to the selective reduction of nitrostyrene in the presence of N2H4·H2O. Kiwi-Minsker and co-workers found that the catalyst CoOx/ACFHNO3 (ACFHNO3 represents HNO3 pre-treatment of the activated carbon fibers) had a near-quantitative yield (99.4%) to 3-vinylaniline compared to the FeOx/ACFHNO3 catalyst, which provided only 84.5% yield in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene using N2H4·H2O [90]. 3.3.2 Bimetal nanocatalysts Nanocatalysts with binary metal component have also been studied to selectively catalyze the reduction of nitrostyrenes using N2H4·H2O as a reducing agent. Michaelis and co-workers reported the Ru-based binary metal catalyst, which were synthesized by supporting bimetallic nanoparticles on polystyrene-based polymer. They studied the catalytic performance in the reduction of nitrostyrene by varying both the composition of bimetallic nanoparticles and the electronic properties of the polymer supports [91]. Compared with monometallic Ru nanocatalyst, bimetal catalysts (Ru/Cu, Ru/Ni, Ru/Fe and Ru/Co) showed outstanding catalytic activity and selectivity, and Ru/Co exhibited the best selectivity (97%) to 3-vinylaniline. Although monometallic Ru, Ru/Cu and Ru/Ni catalysts could achieve 100% conversion and superior selectivity for reducing -NO2 group, their low activity led to a mixture of 3-vinylaniline and various partially reduced byproducts. Even after N2H4·H2O was completely consumed, 3-ethylaniline was not observed with monometallic Ru nanocatalyst. This indicated that their catalytic system was almost inert relative to the -CC group, showing that the excellent selectivity to vinylaniline may be derived from the natural selectivity of N2H4·H2O."
9,Reductions of nitro with NaBH4 and other reductants,"3.4 Reductions of nitro with NaBH4 and other reductants NaBH4 has been reported as a soul hydrogen donor in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol. However, it is active under non-catalytic conditions for the electron-deficient alkenes, such as nitrostyrene. Therefore, the reduction of nitrostyrene using NaBH4 usually shows lower selectivity, and it requires highly selective catalyst to achieve the main product of vinyl aniline. Vaccaro and co-workers used a novel support to protect Au NPs [92]. The support was a zirconium phosphate aminoethyl phosphonate ZP(AEP) that bears aminoethyl groups on the layered surface. Continuously, they also used a solvent-free ball-milling approach to prepare gold-incorporated SBA-15 catalyst [93]. The gold NPs were well protected, so that the aggregation was inhibited and the active sites of the gold NPs were kept to a great extent. This made the catalyst show good performance in terms of reaction activity and chemical selectivity. Non-precious metal nanocatalysts also show good chemoselectivity to reduce NO2 groups. Banerjee and co-workers fixed Ni (0) NPs on g-C3N4 to prepare catalyst (Ni@g-C3N4), which gave aminostyrene with 84% yield using NaBH4 as the hydrogen donor [94]. The g-C3N4 provided excellent support to Ni (0) NPs and prevented its further oxidation to NiO, which preserved the catalyst’s high inherent chemoselectivity. Both Ni NPs and nitrogen atoms had been demonstrated to facilitate the dissociation of NaBH4 to generate active Ni-H- and N-H+ at the catalyst's surface. Furukawa and co-workers reported a series of Pd- and Rh-based intermetallics for the selective reduction of nitrostyrene [11]. They found that the hydrogen donors determined which functional group of nitrostyrene should be reduced. The catalytic transfer hydrogenation reaction with 4-methyl-1-cyclohexene yielded ethylnitrobenzene, and with methanol yielded vinylaniline. Moreover, they also found that increasing the electronegativity of the tuning metal element could provide polar sites and strengthened the activation of methanol, and this accelerated the reduction of -NO2 group in nitrostyrene, thus increased the yield of vinylaniline. Through comparison of a series of Pd- and Rh-based catalysts, respectively, Pd13Pb9 catalyst exhibited the highest selectivity on selectively reducing nitrostyrene to vinylaniline among Pd catalysts, and RhPb2 catalyst not only showed high selectivity but also the highest conversion among the catalysts under study."
10,Dehalogenation-proof reduction of halo-nitrobenzene,"The research on the selective reduction of halogenated nitroarenes (-X, F, Cl, Br, I) has important significance both in theoretical exploration and industrial production. Due to the possibility of dehalogenation during the reaction, the selective reduction of nitro group with maintaining halo group undisturbed still faces great challenges. So far, lots of reports have been published to improve the chemoselectivity of halogenated nitroaromatic reduction to corresponding halogenated anilines using different types of catalysts and different hydrogen sources (such as HCOOH, NaBH4, NH3·BH3, N2H4·H2O, etc.). Therefore, in the following content we will review the recent research on dehalogenation-proof reduction of halo-nitroarenes to identify the important factors that affect chemoselectivity. Metal catalysts using various hydrogen sources for selective reduction of halogenated nitroarenes are summarized in Table 3."
11,Catalytic hydrogenation of halo-nitrobenzene with H2 by various catalyst,"4.1 Catalytic hydrogenation of halo-nitrobenzene with H2 by various catalyst 4.1.1 Nanocatalysts with mono precious metal component The hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes with H2 catalyzed by noble metal usually has good conversion. However, the hydrogenation is always accompanied with the formation of de-halogenation by-products. Recently, many studies have been committed to improve the chemoselectivity of precious metal catalysts. The selectivity on hydrogenating halogenated nitroarenes can be improved by modifying the metal surface and to generate metal-support interaction. Ichikawa and co-workers investigated Pt/C catalysts that are used for selectively reduction of chloronitrobenzene (CNB) to the corresponding chloroaniline in supercritical carbon dioxide [115]. Supercritical carbon dioxide hindered the active site of the catalyst for dechlorination to greatly improve the selectivity of chloroaniline. Zhang and co-works used acetylene as a medium in the preparation of metallic platinum nanocatalysts [117]. During the calcination process, acetylene was converted into thin carbon shells, which tightly wrapped platinum NPs to limit the growth of platinum atoms and maintained the small size of platinum NPs with good dispersion. In addition, the formed carbon shells modified the surface of Pt NPs, which suppressed the dehalogenation reaction. Lou and co-workers synthesized platinum NPs using thiol-terminated polymers [121]. Thiol groups were fixed to the unsaturated surface of metallic platinum NPs, and the high active sites were hindered for avoiding dehalogenation. The above strategies achieved selective control by modifying intrinsic activity of the catalysts. In another case, Chen and co-workers presented a preferential adsorption protocol. They prepared the zeolite encapsulated platinum nanoparticles for controlling selectivity on hydrogenating p-CNB ( Fig. 4) [126]. The structure of the zeolite allowed p-CNB to be adsorbed on the surface of Pt NPs only through the end-on groups. The adsorption energy of -NO2 group was greater than that of halogen group, which indicated the preferential adsorption of -NO2 group. Supports strongly influence the activity and selectivity of the metal catalysts. Special supports can not only generate metal-support interactions with metals, but also directly affect the adsorption manner of the nitroarenes on the metal surface. Xiao and co-workers prepared crystalline zeolite-Beta supported Pd (Pd@Beta) for selectively hydrogenating nitroarenes [128]. Pd nanoparticles were encapsulated in the zeolite micropores, and the catalyst could prefer to adsorb -NO2 group on the surface. They found that Pd nanoparticles encapsulated by zeolite are much better than Pd supported on the surface of zeolite (Pd/Beta). IR results showed that Pd@Beta could adsorb CNB through both -NO2 group and chloro atom, but only nitrobenzene could be adsorbed in the competitive adsorption experiments. This suggested that the selectivity can be ascribed to the preferential adsorption. Li and co-workers synthesized a carbon supported Pd/SnO2 catalyst [116]. XPS results showed that electrons moved from Pd atoms to SnO2, which changed the electronic structure of metal Pd. The oxygen deficiency of SnO2 inhibited C-F activation but promoted -NO2 group reduction. Vanni and co-workers used black phosphorus as a 2D structural support [122]. EXAFS investigation showed that Pd and P formed a coordination bond, which offered the high selectivity of hydrogenerating CNB to chloroaniline. Pietrowski and co-workers synthesized Pt NPs catalyst with a metal Co-doped MgF2 as a support [123]. The existence of metal Co promoted the movement of electron to Pt atom. FTIR research showed that the -NO2 group could be adsorbed not only through the coordination of nitrogen atom to the electron-rich Pt, but also through the coordination of oxygen atom to the Mg2+ that is the electron deficient center. The selectivity of this catalyst on reducing o-CNB to o-chloroaniline was 100% with the in-situ hydrogen, which is generated from the methyl alcohol aqueous phase reforming. Shi and co-worker compared catalytic performance of Pt NPs supported on two carbonaceous materials, the N-doped carbon nanocubes and carbon nanocubes modified by oxygen-containing functional groups [124]. XPS results showed that N and O increased the electron density of Pt, thus made the particles easier to adsorb the electron-deficient -NO2 groups. Therefore, the selectivity of both catalysts was significantly improved compared with bare Pt NPs. The identical location TEM showed that Pt/H-NCNTs were more stable than Pt/oCNTs, indicating that the N-doped supports and metal had stronger metal-support interaction. Sadjadi and co-workers wrapped a metal Pd catalyst with a N-rich tetrahedral hollow carbon shell [125]. The high surface area carbon shell and an interaction of N and Pd allowed the support to contain a large amount of Pd NPs, which leached very little during reaction. Liang and co-workers found that the N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (NOMC) supported Pt had smaller NPs (about 1.0 ± 0.5 nm) than the Pt NPs supported without nitrogen doping [118]. Due to the synergistic effect of mesoporous materials, the N-functionalized support stabled the ultra-small sized Pt NPs catalyst had a high conversion (100%) and selectivity (> 99%) on hydrogenating halo-nitrobenzene. More than Pt, the metals Pd, Ru, Rh and Ir have also been used for the selectively catalytic reduction of halogenated nitrobenzene. Tamura and co-workers prepared MoOx-modified Ru/SiO2 catalysts [17]. The kinetic parameters proved that the -NO2 group would be strongly adsorbed on MoOx. The hydride generated at the interface of Ru/MoOx had a strong ability of hydrogenating -NO2 group by nucleophilic attacks. Wang and co-workers found that Ir NPs at sub-nanometer level had high selectivity for hydrogenating halo-nitrobenzene, and DFT calculations showed that the distance of Ir-O was much shorter than Pd-O, but the distance of Ir-Cl was much longer than Pd-Cl [119]. This suggested that Ir NPs had greater barriers for dehalogenation reaction. Sun and co-workers found that Pd, Pt and Rh/Fe3O4 all had excellent catalytic performance, while the TOF value of Pt was the highest. According to the kinetic analysis results, the apparent reaction orders of Pd, Pt and Rh were 0.8, 0.8 and 1.5, respectively [120]. They also prepared Rh catalysts supported on magnetic silica spheres, which are modified with different groups (-NH2, -SH, -SO3H, -NCH2, -Cl, -NHCOCH3, -NHCH2Ph) [127]. They found that the electron-donating group increased the ratio of Rh0/Rh3+, which enhanced the catalytic activity and selectivity. The amino-modified catalyst had a higher selectivity on hydrogenating halo-nitrobenzene. 4.1.2 Nanocatalysts with mono non-precious metal component Unlike precious metals that have high hydrogen dissociation activity, non-precious metals have inherent activity defects. However, non-precious metals have recently attracted a lot of attention due to their richness in the earth and cost-effectiveness. Due to their poor activity, many researchers are committed to designing efficient catalysts with special structures. Using MOF materials as precursors is currently an important strategy for the synthesis of ideal catalysts. MOF materials have large surface area and high porosity. It can increase the mass transfer rate of the reactants and enhance the availability of the metal components. In addition, the heteroatoms are also helpful to enhance the catalytic performance. Li and co-workers fabricated the cobalt-based catalysts supported on nitrogen doped carbon by pyrolyzing ZIF-67 [68]. In situ ATR-IR and XPS characterizations revealed that the Co-N may be the centers for the preferential adsorption and selective hydrogenation of -NO2 groups. Yang and co-workers developed porous graphitic carbon layers encapsulated Ni NPs (Ni@C) by pyrolyzing Ni-containing MOF. The Ni@C catalyst achieved superior activity and selectivity to o-chloroaniline at the condition of 140 °C and 0.5 MPa of H2 [137], while commercial Ni NPs and Ni/AC gave poor reactivity for hydrogenating o-CNB. These indicated that the highly dispersed Ni and graphitic carbon layers of the Ni@C catalyst determined the outstanding catalytic performance. Gascon and co-workers prepared the Co@N-doped carbon catalyst by pyrolyzing ZIF-67 [131], and it exhibited much higher activity than Co NPs. Transition metal dichalcogenides have been widely studied as 2D materials, and they are discovered active for the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes. Schaak and co-workers found that pyrite-type FeS2 nanoparticles exhibited activity to the selective reduction of nitroarenes using H2 [130]. The reaction required 120 °C and 50 bar of H2 for 18 h to achieve a high conversion. Sun and co-workers prepared a two-dimensional 2H-WS2 [69], which was composed of single and few-layer nanosheet. The S vacancies and W-terminated edges of the catalyst facilitated selectivity. The transfer of hydrogen to -NO2 group was due to the preferential perpendicular adsorption geometry or due to the lower kinetic barrier. Queen and co-workers reported Co3S4/CN hollow nanobox derived from MOF material [134]. The prepared catalyst could inhibit dehalogenation upon selectively reduced nitroarenes, resulting in pure aniline products. The chemical state of non-noble metals has a great relationship with activity. Most active sites are on zero-valent metal atoms. To obtain highly active catalyst, it is necessary to prevent metal atoms from being oxidized during the material preparation process. Transition mental Co supported on carbon catalysts had a good performance for chemoselective hydrogenation of halogenated nitrobenzene. Li and co-workers prepared Co/CoO NPs encapsulated with graphene layers [132]. The activity of this catalyst was strongly affected by the chemical valence of metal atoms. The metallic Co would be oxidized without surface protection of nano-graphite layer, resulting in a decline in catalytic activity. Dai and co-workers found that the optimal Co/N-doped carbon catalyst displayed > 99% chemoselectivity in reduction of halonitrobenzene to anilines [129]. The catalytic performance was due to the rapid dissociation of H2 at the active sites of CoNx, which was proved by the isotopic H2-D2 exchange experiments. Moreover, the facile adsorption of reactant substances rendered the selectivity towards nitro group. Similarly, Beller and co-workers prepared cobalt-based catalysts from α-diimine complexes [135]. This catalyst featured a core-shell structure, and it consisted of metallic cobalt and cobalt oxides decorated with N-doped graphitic layers. Straightforward kinetic measurements suggested a direct and linear correlation between the intrinsic activity (in terms of the kinetic constant) and the total amount of nitrogen. To further understand the relationship between metallic Co and C support, Corma and co-workers prepared the Co NPs covered by a thin C layer [136]. The H2–D2 exchange experiments showed that the reduced Co encapsulated by carbon layer could dissociate H2. The IR adsorption results indicated that metallic Co would only preferentially adsorb -NO2 groups. Therefore, the Co@C catalyst can reduce halogenated nitrobenzenes with high activity and selectivity. 4.1.3 Nanocatalysts with binary metal component Monometallic catalysts have been widely studied, but due to the expensive precious metals and the low activity of non-precious metals, many studies have been devoted to bimetallic catalysts. There are two main ways for constructing bimetal catalyst to increase the selectivity of hydrogenating halo-nitrobenzenes to the corresponding anilines. One is to prepare a simple alloy, which alternates the catalytic performance because of the interaction of the two metals. The other one is to synthesize the orderly intermetallic mixture so that the active sites preferentially adsorb -NO2 group, thereby improving the selectivity of the reaction. Furukawa and co-workers fabricated a variety of Pt-based bimetallic alloys [139]. Among a variety of PtM alloys (M = Co, Cu, Fe, Ga, In, Ni, Pb, Sn, and Zn), the electron density around the platinum atom in the PtZn alloy was the maximum, and the PtZn alloy exhibited the most outstanding yields with atmospheric H2 pressure and 40 °C. DFT calculations showed that PtZn alloy had a higher activation energy for the dechlorination reaction than metal platinum. Similarly, Zhang and co-workers synthesized NixCo1-X with different components for selectively hydrogenating nitroarenes [141]. The results showed that the 1:1 molar ratio of the two metals gave the highest reaction activity. XPS research showed that Ni0.5Co0.5 NPs had the highest electron density compared with other NixCo1-x@NC catalysts, which was responsible for the reduction of -NO2. The atomic arrangement of most alloys is random, but intermetallic compounds have orderly atomic arrangement. As mentioned in the previous section, the ordered alloy PtSn/mSiO2 and Pt-Sn/H-MoOx catalysts also exhibit excellent catalytic performance for the selective hydrogenation of chloronitroarenes to corresponding aniline [6,71]. Liu and co-workers prepared platinum@tin core-shell nanoparticles [138]. After the calcination process, the metal tin was oxidized. DFT calculations proved that the adsorption of hydrogen and o-CNB was enhanced, while the adsorption of o-chloroaniline was weakened due to the interaction between metals. When using Ir-based catalysts, the selectivity for hydrogenation of nitroarenes was relatively low due to the rapid formation of phenylhydroxylamine intermediate. To solve this problem, Yu and co-workers prepared Ir-based Nanocatalysts with binary metal component [140]. They found that the selectivity of nitroarenes hydrogenation increased with the conversion rate. This was because the high catalytic activity avoided the accumulation of intermediate products. The hydrogen activation of single metal gold was low, but mixing with Ni will enhance the hydrogen activation as reported by Wang and co-workers [77]. They found that the catalytic performance of AuNi/SiO2 NPs was much higher than the mechanical mixing of Au/SiO2 NPs and Ni/SiO2 NPs, which suggested the strong interaction of the two metals. 4.1.4 Single-atom and nanocluster catalysts Metal single atoms and clusters can also introduce unique adsorption manner for reactions of halo-nitroarenes. Wang and co-workers prepared the Ni single atoms supported on nitrogen-doped porous carbon ( Fig. 5) [142]. They found that the different pyrolysis temperature will lead to different main coordination number of Ni-N (Ni-N2, Ni-N3, Ni-N4; the corresponding pyrolysis temperature was 600 °C, 700 °C and 800 °C). The Ni-N3 active species exhibited higher activity than Ni-N2 and Ni-N4 for hydrogenating 4-CNB. DFT calculation determined that the Ni-N3 possessed the best catalytic capability because of the lowest adsorption energy and longest NO bond length, and this was in line with the optimal performance of Ni-N-C-700, which bore more Ni-N3 sites than Ni-N-C-600 and Ni-N-C-800. To obtain a highly dispersed catalyst, Li and co-workers intercalated atomically precise Ag clusters into α-ZrP matrix through ion exchange [144]. Ag clusters were highly dispersed because of the protection by carbon layer, in the absence of which the Ag nanoparticles became larger and decreased the selectivity of hydrogenating the substituted nitroarenes. Zhang and co-workers prepared palladium clusters supported on CeO2 porous nanorods (PN-CeO2) [143]. The novel material (named as PdsNC/PNCeO2) showed good activity and chemoselectivity on hydrogenating various nitroarenes. Moreover, this catalyst had a TOF of 44059 ~h-1. DFT calculation determined that the adsorption energy of -NO2 groups on CeO2 surface was lower than on Pd clusters, thus limited the by-products. The highly dispersed palladium clusters were beneficial to activate H2 for the high catalytic performance, and the oxygen vacancy of PN-CeO2 was responsible for the good chemoselectivity."
12,Reduction with N2H4·H2O,"4.2 Reduction with N2H4·H2O Although hydrazine hydrate is the highest natural selective hydrogen source for nitroarenes, dehalogenation occurs to some extent. This will cause the impurities that are not expired in the target anilines. Therefore, various catalysts have been well studied in selectively reducing halo-nitroarenes with N2H4·H2O. 4.2.1 Nanocatalysts with mono precious metal component Precious metal nanocatalysts have been widely investigated to prevent dehalogenation. Wang and co-workers attached platinum nanoparticles on different supports such as ordered mesoporous carbon materials, nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon materials, SiO2, γ-Al2O3, and activated carbon ( Fig. 6) [38]. The experiments exhibited that the N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon loaded catalyst had unprecedented catalytic activity, and it afforded 100% selectivity for reducing CNB. Such excellent selectivity was put down to the synergy of platinum NPs and nitrogen, which conducted the preferential adsorption of -NO2 group on the catalyst. Meanwhile, N acted as a basic sited at the interface of the support to inhibit the activation C-halogen bonds on the Pt NPs. Zou and co-workers prepared an ordered mesoporous silica-supported ruthenium nanoparticle catalyst [39], which was used in the selective reduction of halo-nitroarenes. The catalyst exhibited extremely high catalytic activity and excellent chemoselectivity for reducing the -NO2 group. Whether the halogen group was in the ortho, meta, or para position, the reaction could be completed within 0.5 h with the selectivity of over 99%. This support structure protected the intrinsic activity of the precious metal nanoparticles itself to achieve high selectivity. Sun and co-workers used a core-shell structured catalyst to protect Rh NPs ( Fig. 7a and b) [42]. The protection of the porous silica shell could make the N2H4·H2O slowly released to the active site, then the utilization of the reducing agent maximized. In their another work, the Rh NPs were anchored on the carbon-Wrapped Fe3O4 sphere (Fig. 7c) [145]. This catalyst also showed good performance to give over 99% selectivity of chloroaniline. They also used the Rh/Fe3O4/g-C3N4-N catalyst to selectively reduce the halo-nitroarenes, which also exhibited good catalytic activity and chemoselectivity (Fig. 7d) [37]. This may be attributed to the strong interaction between Rh and Fe3O4. Besides the catalyst, reaction conditions and molecular structure of a substrate can also affect the selectivity of the catalyst. Li and co-workers conducted an interesting experiment [9]. They carried out the reaction with a Pt/C catalyst under three different thermal environments, which were heating in a sealed tube, heating with open refluxing and heating with microwave reactor. Experimental results showed that 1-bromo-4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene was completely reduced to 3-(tert-butyl) aniline within 1h and in a sealed tube. Under open reflux heating, 1-bromo-4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzene could be reduced to 2-bromo-5-(tert-butyl) aniline in 5 minutes. Microwave reactor also gave the debromination product within 15 min. Platinum was reported to have high catalytic activation of CBr bonds in the presence of H2. This work can be an evidence that N2H4 has the natural selectivity towards nitro group, as in an open vessel the N2H4 produced H2 will release thus the debromination does not occur. 4.2.2 Single non-precious metal catalysts The intrinsic activity of non-noble metals is not as high as that of noble metals, and the reaction process is relatively gentle [177]. Therefore, they usually have good chemical selectivity especially using N2H4 as the hydrogen donor. Design and preparation of a catalyst with uniform dispersion and stable structure have become the key of the research on the non-precious metal catalysts for reducing halo-nitroarenes. As the representative of the non-precious metal catalysts, various forms of iron-based catalysts have been developed for the hydrazine mediated reduction of nitro. Next, we will introduce 5 different types of iron-based catalysts for the selective reduction of halo-nitroarenes with N2H4·H2O. Sun and co-workers developed pure flowerlike amorphous α-FeOOH hierarchical supraparticles ( Fig. 8a) [56], which exhibited outstanding catalytic activity and chemoselectivity in reducing halo-nitroarenes. No dehalogenation occurred during the experiment. The unique amorphous crystal structure and adsorption−desorption synergy were two important sources of excellent performance of the catalyst. In another work, they used a new type of porous carbon capped γ-Fe2O3 NPs to obtain the catalyst (γ-Fe2O3@3DPCF) (Fig. 8b) [147], which had good catalytic performance, and no dechlorination occurred in reducing CNBs, no matter whether the chloro group is in the ortho-, meta-, or para-position or mono- or di-chloro substituted substrates were used. Dong and co-workers used a simple method to obtain the Fe metal-organic gel by coordination, which was carbonized at 500 °C under inert conditions to form the catalyst γ-Fe2O3/MC (Fig. 8c–e) [146]. The active sites of γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were evenly encapsulated in the support, which demonstrated excellent chemoselectivity for the N2H4·H2O mediated halo-nitroarenes reduction to corresponding products. Yun and co-workers not only focused on the design of the catalyst structure but also used the synergy between the elements to promote the activity and chemoselectivity [148]. The Fe/Fe3C was inlaid uniformly in a nitrogen-doped carbon tube to form a catalyst with a core-shell structure, which protected Fe NPs to guarantee the excellent performance. Experimental results and DFT indicated that the nitrogen sites on the catalyst surface could capture nitrobenzene and aniline with the assistance of phenyl, which made the catalyst have higher catalytic activity and chemoselectivity. To make the metal highly dispersed, Li and co-workers prepared the catalyst by loading the Fe single atoms on nitrogen-doped carbon [54]. Uniform and clear catalytic sites were important guarantee that the catalyst had high activity and selectivity. Simultaneously, they proved the excellent performance through DFT calculations. The well-dispersed single Fe atoms played an important role because of its lower barrier energy. Other non-metal catalysts are also used to selectively reduce halogenated nitroarenes using N2H4·H2O as a hydrogen source. Lu and co-workers first prepared cobalt oxide supported on mesoporous alumina, which was treated with 1,10-phenanthroline at 700 °C in N2 atmosphere to give the catalyst (Co-NC/γ-MA) [149]. The catalyst retained a mesoporous structure and Co3O4 was reduced to Co NPs, which were highly dispersed in the γ-MA framework. The interaction between Co and N, C improved the chemical selectivity of the catalyst. Noticeably, some functional groups in the organic reactant will also affect the selectivity of the catalyst. Dhakshinamoorthy and co-workers found that slight dehalogenation occurred in reducing halo-nitroarenes using CeO2 nanoparticles, and this was caused by the aniline produced in the reaction [150]. This was consistent with the precious metal catalyst that electron-donating groups reduced catalyst selectivity, and evidenced the intrinsic selectivity of iron oxide towards the hydrazine mediated reduction of nitroarenes. 4.2.3 Catalysts with two metallic elements Because of the interactions between metals and metal oxides, nanocatalysts with binary metal component are easier to meet the demands of both selectivity and activity than single metal catalysts. The synergy of bimetals and the interaction between the active components and the support often result excellent performance of a catalyst. Sun and co-workers fabricated a novel nanocatalyst (Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-FeCu) [55]. The FeCu alloy could be magnetically anchored in porous silica. The modification of Cu enriched the d-electron of Fe, which led to the catalyst good chemoselectivity, and it could effectively prevent dehalogenation when reducing halo-nitroarenes. They also prepared an iron-tin bimetallic nanocatalyst (C@Fe2O3-SnO2), while the synergy between the two metal oxides enhanced the overall capacity of the catalyst [151]. When reducing CNB, the yield of chloroaniline reached 99%. Ma and co-workers prepared Co-Ag bimetallic nanocatalyst that was supported on porous nitrogen-doped carbon [152]. The support not only provided protection for the bimetallic NPs but also had the synergistic effect with the bimetallic nanoparticles. Following the same guidance, Lu and co-workers loaded Co-MoO3 NPs on ordered mesoporous silica with nitrogen-doped graphite carbon, and the obtained catalyst (Co-MoO3/NC@SBA-15) also exhibited superior performance for reducing halo-nitroarenes [153]. They pointed out that the Co-Nx(C)-Mo was produced on the catalyst surface due to the interaction between Co-Nx(C) and MoO3, and this was why the catalyst showed high performance. Sun and co-workers usesd iron, bismuth and graphene oxide as raw materials to prepare the catalyst (tBFGO) by co-precipitation [43]. Doping bismuth and graphene oxide significantly enhanced the performance of the iron-based catalyst. The catalyst had a selectivity to p-chloroaniline up to 98%. They also designed another iron-bismuth bimetallic egg-like catalyst (Fe3O4@nSiO2-NH2-Fe2O3•xBi2O3@mSiO2) [154]. The protection of mesoporous silica and the synergistic effect of iron and bismuth were important guarantees that the catalyst exhibited great chemoselectivity."
13,Reductions with NaBH4,"4.3 Reductions with NaBH4 4.3.1 Nanocatalysts with mono precious metal component As an economical and readily available hydrogen source, NaBH4 is widely used in various reductive reactions. As a hydride type hydrogen donor, NaBH4 usually exhibits excellent chemical selectivity in the reduction of halo-nitroarenes. Precious metals have universal catalytic activity to selectively reduce halo-nitroarenes. Sun and co-workers used aldol condensation to prepare metal-supramolecular polymer precursors, which were consequent annealed to form the carbon supported sub 3 nm nanocomposite (USMNPs@PCF, USM include Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd and Pt) [155]. The resulting catalysts contained ultra-small metal (oxide) NPs that were fixed on the porous carbon framework with high dispersion. When Pt was used as the active center, the selectivity of the catalyst to chloroaniline was 99%. Processing and optimization of the support can make the catalyst exhibit good catalytic activity, selectivity and stability. Gholinejad and co-workers used creatine as a ligand to modify natural bentonite [156]. The modified material could fix palladium NPs (about 3 nm) on its surface to obtain a catalyst (bento-crt@Pd), and the Pd NPs still maintained a good dispersion after 7 cycles of reducing 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene. At the same time, with NaBH4 as the hydrogen source, the output of 1-chloro-4-aminobenzene still reached 90% after 7 cycles. They also used creatine functionalized starch as a support to fix 4 nm Au nanoparticles for constructing a catalyst starch-crt@Au [157]. Compared with the catalyst prepared by the support without creatine modification, the starch-crt@Au showed better performance in the catalytic activity, selectivity and cycle times. The researchers have applied porous organic polymer (POPs) and hypercrosslinked polymers (HCPs) as supports for heterogeneous catalysts. Dong and co-workers prepared HCPs and loaded small Pd nanoparticles [158]. The N atoms in HCPs could fix Pd NPs and make them highly dispersed. The catalyst showed outstanding catalytic activity and selectivity on reducing nitroarenes. Notably, using NaBH4 as a hydrogen source，the halo-nitroarenes could be reduced to halo-anilines with more than 98% conversion and 99.9% selectivity. Chen and co-workers prepared the phosphorus-rich HCP [159]. By using the in-situ reduction method to load Ru NPs on the polymer, a catalyst (Ru-PPT) was be obtained with high selectivity for reducing halo-nitrobenzene. Notably, when 4-chloro, 4-bromo and 4-iodo substituted nitrobenzenes were used as substrates, no obvious dehalogenation product was detected, and the corresponding products were obtained in > 96% yields. Dong and co-workers prepared porous organic polymers containing nitrogenous substituents (PC-POP) using piperazine and cyanuric chloride as raw materials [160]. Pd NPs were highly dispersed and confined in the pores of PC-POP. The protection and dispersion of PC-POP made the catalyst have good chemical selectivity, and the selectivity was greater than 99% when NaBH4 was used to reduce CNB. Li and co-workers synthesized the graphene-like porous carbon-rich network (GYLPC) by the acetylene metathesis reaction [161]. The network was connected to the sp-hybridized and sp2-hybridized carbon atom, which had a large number of the conjugated structure. After oxidation, this type of support was more conducive for the in-situ reduction of the precious metal nanoparticles, which were stabilized by the interaction between metal and the support to promote the selectivity. The special structure and size are also an important guarantee for the excellent selectivity of the catalyst. Sun and co-workers designed and fabricated a highly reactive catalyst (Fe3O4@snPt@PCN) ( Fig. 9a) [162]. They used porous carbon nitride to ensure the stability of the magnetically hollow platinum nanocage. The thickness of the cage walls was about subnanometer. The unique nanocage structure offered the catalyst high atom utilization efficiency and rapid electronic transform during the reaction. When halo-nitroarenes were used to detect catalytic activity and chemical selectivity, no dehalogenation occurred. 4.3.2 Nanocatalysts with mono non-precious metal component Nickel metal has high selectivity for the reduction of halogenated nitrobenzene, as it is difficult for the halo-nitroarenes to undergo the oxidative addition reaction on the active site of Ni. Therefore, some nickel-based materials have been developed as the intrinsic selective catalysts to reduce halo-nitrobenzene with NaBH4. Dell’Anna and co-workers prepared a catalyst by calcining the copolymer of Ni and polyacrylamide [163]. The Ni NPs were evenly distributed on the polymer support to expose active sites as many as possible. This allowed the catalyst to exhibit good activity and selectivity. Similarly, Asadi and co-worker used DNA to support Ni NPs to obtain a catalyst [164]. The unique structure and properties of DNA allowed Ni NPs to be well protected, thereby avoiding agglomeration caused by the high surface energy of the metal surface. When NaBH4 was the hydrogen source, the yield of p-chloroaminobenzene was 96%. Nemati and co-workers used a new magnetic core/shell material as the catalyst, namely CuFe2O4@SiO2@g-C3N4/Cu [165]. When using NaBH4 as a hydrogen donor, no dehalogenation occurred in the reduction of bromonitrobenzene. Meantime, computation demonstrated that embedding Cu NPs in the layer of g-C3N4 would change the bond length and bond order, which caused a slight change in the catalyst structure. In addition, the calculation showed that the relation between the Cu atom and the N atom around it was electrostatic interaction, and the obtained electrostatic potential and spin density provided a circumstance for the effective reaction. 4.3.3 Nanocatalysts with binary metal component Adjusting electronic effect by adding another metal is an excellent means to control the chemoselectivity of the catalysts in the selective reduction of halogenated nitrobenzene. Zhao and his colleagues improved the selectivity of the catalyst (PdxNiy-P) by adjusting the electronic structure of palladium nanoparticles (Fig. 9b and c) [166]. The XPS characterization indicated the electron outflowing from Pd. The electron deficiency of Pd NPs and low crystallinity of the catalyst were critical to the selectivity of the catalyst, which reduced its ability for carbon-halogen bond cleavage. Low crystallinity helped to prevent the missing of active sites due to the agglomeration of Pd NPs. Murugavel and co-workers used chitosan (CS) wrapped magnetite as a core-shell structural support, where AgNi bimetallic nanoparticles were anchored to obtain a catalyst Fe3O4@CS_AgNi [167]. The strong interaction between AgNi NPs and Fe3O4@CS, which originated from the amino group of CS and AgNi NPs, guaranteed the excellent performance of the catalyst. When NaBH4 was used as the hydrogen source, the selectivity of the p-chloroaminobenzene and p-fluoroaminobenzene was 98% and 100%, respectively. Bai and co-workers obtained a catalyst by anchoring the Pd-Fe bimetallic NPs (6 nm) to the interface of carbon nanotubes/N-doped carbon, and this catalyst had excellent reactivity and chemical selectivity for reducing halo-nitrobenzene [169]. Bimetallic nanoparticles were protected by the support that had large specific surface area. Moreover, the interaction with this support explained why the catalyst had good performance. Another similar work was reported by Dong and co-workers, who loaded PdCo bimetallic nanoparticles on carbon fibers that are made from cotton [168]. PdCo NPs were evenly dispersed on the support, and Pd NPs were closely deposited on Co NPs to maximize the utilization rate of Pd."
14,Reductions with NH3·BH3 and other reductants,"4.4 Reductions with NH3·BH3 and other reductants 4.4.1 Reductions with NH3·BH3 Ammonia borane (AB) is a solid hydrogen source with the known highest hydrogen content, which has the advantages of stability, safety, non-toxicity, etc. It is widely used in the selective reduction of halogenated nitroarenes. As a naturally selective borohydride, the negative H transfer from NH3·BH3 and the hydrogenation of nitroarenes in sequence can greatly improve the selectivity of the reaction. Zhang and co-workers used reducing Au NPs with acetylene to prepare catalyst [170]. The acetylene was converted into a non-volatile organic protective layer in situ on the surface of Au NPs, and the well-protected small size Au NPs showed good performance on selectively reduction of the p-CNB with AB. To get a good dispersion of active metal, Dong and co-workers precisely prepared Ru nanoclusters with a size of about 0.65 nm and fixed them in a porous organic cage [171]. The organic support with high specific surface area and rich pore structure could efficiently transfer the substrates and products, and protect the highly exposed Ru nanoclusters from aggregation during the reaction. When used this kind of catalyst, the reduction of halogenated nitrobenzene showed high selectivity whether the substituent was in the ortho, meta or para position. Single-atomic catalysts have the greatest atom utilization efficiency. Yu and co-workers used a zeolite framework to wrap Ru single atom in order to stabilize them [172]. The super high exposure of Ru ensured the reaction efficiency of the AB mediated reduction of halo-nitroarenes, and Ru single atom protected by the zeolite framework endued the catalyst good stability. Some well-designed non-noble metal nanocatalysts also showed excellent selectivity with AB as the highly active hydrogen source. Liu and co-workers prepared a support-free 3D hierarchical nanoporous Cu@Cu2O catalyst [173]. It had a sponge-like structure with a very high specific surface area, and this exposed the active site to the greatest extent and avoided the occurrence of particle aggregation. This structure made the Cu-based catalyst show high activity, good chemical selectivity and excellent recyclability. 4.4.2 Reductions with other reductants In addition to the several hydrogen sources that are described in the foregoing, other hydrogen sources, such as formic acid and tetrahydroxydiboron (THDB), have been also applied in selectively reducing halo-nitroarenes. Song and co-workers used cobalt single atoms that were fixed on N-doped ultrathin carbon nanosheets as catalysts and HCOOH as a hydrogen donor to reduce halogenated nitrobenzene [174]. The advantages of single atom component and the good mass transfer property of the support made the catalyst exhibit extremely high performance. Wang and co-workers also used the HCOOH to reduce halogenated nitrobenzene, and they immobilized Co nanoparticles on N, S-doped porous carbon to obtain the catalyst. They claimed that the synergy between the elements improved the chemical selectivity of the catalyst [175]. The electron transfer between Co NPs and heteroatom-doped carbon was an important pathway to activate formic acid, and the presence of S was beneficial to the deprotonation of formic acid. At the same time, the incorporation of heteroatoms could polarize the carbon shell, thereby the selectivity generated from the preferential adsorption of -NO2 group that exhibited polarity. Shaikh and co-workers prepared a catalyst (Rh@Fe3O4) by supporting sub-nano Rh NPs (< 1 nm) on ultra-small magnetic nanoparticles (8–10 nm), and tetrahydroxydiboron (THDB) was used as a hydrogen source to reduce halogenated nitrobenzene [176]. Highly exposed active sites and sub-nanometer size were the reasons why the catalyst showed excellent performance. They pointed out that THDB reacted with the -NO2 group rather than the dissolved oxygen during the reaction, which could be assigned to the natural selectivity for the reduction of halogenated nitrobenzene."
15,Chemoselective reduction of nitrobenzaldehyde and nitroacetophenone,"Selective reduction of nitrobenzaldehyde and nitroacetophenone to the corresponding anilines while keeping unsaturated aldehyde groups and carbonyl groups inert is also a huge challenge. Various hydrogen sources meet difficulty in this application, as natural activity that do not require catalyst usually bring unexpected reactivity, such as LiAlH4 can reduce carbonyl and nitro groups in the absence of a catalyst, while NaBH4 reacts with aldehydes to give corresponding alcohols at room temperature. Only those metal catalysts with high activity can realize the selective reduction of -NO2 group. Recently, some metal catalysts have been reported to efficiently and selectively reduce the -NO2 groups of nitrobenzaldehyde and nitroacetophenone using various hydrogen sources, which are listed in Table 4."
16,Reduction with H2,"5.1 Reduction with H2 5.1.1 Nanocatalysts with mono precious metal component Nanocatalysts with mono precious metal component have also been widely studied on selectively hydrogenating nitrobenzaldehyde and nitroacetophenone to the corresponding anilines. It is reported that Pd often transforms the -NO2 groups as well as carbonyl groups, thus leading to undesirable selectivity [190], but SnO2 can improve the performance of selective reduction of -NO2 group [191]. Therefore, Zhou and co-workers synthesized Pd3-(SnO2)1/Al2O3 heteroaggregate nanocatalysts by in-situ transformation of Pd3Sn1 bimetallic NPs on Al2O3. This catalyst showed higher catalytic performance on selectively hydrogenated p-nitroacetophenone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde at 0.1 MPa H2 than monometallic Pd/Al2O3 nanocatalysts [178]. DFT calculations showed that Pd-SnO2 promoted the adsorption of reactants compared with products, and this improved the catalytic activity even with partial coverage of Pd surfaces with SnO2. Moreover, they speculated that higher selectivity was attributed to the blockage effect of SnO2 on Pd surfaces, and this could restrain the coordination of carbonyl groups on the active sites. Another effective method is that the sterically controlled adsorption in the zeolite micropores can improve the selectivity. For example, the Pd@Zeolite Catalyst that has been reviewed in the previous section also demonstrated superior selectivity on hydrogenating 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and 4-nitroacetophenone to the corresponding anilines [128]. Moreover, Lu and co-workers reported that small gold nanoparticles stabilized by carbon nanospheres (Au@C) also exhibited excellent selectivity (99.3% selectivity and 99% conversion) on hydrogenating 4-nitrobenzaldehyde to 4-aminobenzaldehyde at 80 °C and 1.6 MPa H2 [179]. 5.1.2 Nanocatalysts with mono non-precious metal component Nickel phosphide is the common non-metallic catalyst that is used in the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzaldehyde. Zou and co-workers supported ultra-dispersed nickel phosphide on P-doped carbon (Ni2P/PC) ( Fig. 10) [8]. They found that the electron immigrated from carbon to nickel phosphide, which dropped the d-band center of the nickel atom. The energy level of anti-bonding orbit decreased, thus leaded to the downshift of H dissociation energy. In the reaction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, the selectivity of 4-aminobenzaldehyde could achieve > 99.9%. DFT calculation indicated that the adsorption energies of -NO2 and aldehyde groups on nickel phosphide were similar, and the parallel adsorption on the surface of Ni2P was the most stable (Fig. 10f). This explained the low selectivity of bulk Ni2P. For Ni2P/PC, due to the geometric hindrance of nickel phosphide clusters on PC, the molecules could not be adsorbed on very small nickel phosphide in parallel on the P-doped carbon. The results showed that 4-nitrobenzaldehyde was most stable when adsorbed via -NO2. This preferential adsorption provided the excellent selectivity of 4-aminobenzaldehyde. 5.1.3 Nanocatalysts with binary metal component Bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts usually display better performance than their monometallic counterparts, and they have also been used to enhance the selectivity of hydrogenating the nitrobenzaldehyde and nitroacetophenone to the corresponding anilines. Li and co-workers synthesized a series of bimetallic RhxNiy (x, y = 1, 2, 3) nanoparticles using the “noble metal-induced reduction” strategy [180]. Compared to these RhxNiy nanoparticles and Rh only nanoparticles, the Rh3Ni1 nanoparticles catalyst exhibited the best activity and selectivity (> 99% selectivity and > 99% conversion) for hydrogenating the -NO2 groups of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and 4-nitroacetophenone under atmospheric pressure H2 and room temperature, highlighting the significant synergy between the two metals. Similarly, Tsukuda and co-workers reported that PVP-stabilized colloidal RhCu nanoparticles could achieve a selectivity of 97% for the hydrogenation of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde to 4-aminobenzaldehyde using 0.1 MPa of H2 at 298 K, and this significantly out-performed the 70% selectivity of the single Rh nanoparticles [181]. Moreover, Burilov and co-workers reported that a copper–palladium catalyst supported on amino-modified silica could achieve the best selectivity (99%) for reducing the -NO2 group of 3-nitrobenzaldehyde in a flow hydrogenation reactor compared to some commercially available palladium catalysts (Pd/Al2O3, Pd/C, and Pd/BaSO4) [182]. 5.1.4 Single-atom and nanocluster catalysts It is reported that single-atom and nanocluster catalysts can also provide outstanding selectivity on hydrogenated nitrobenzaldehyde and nitroacetophenone to the corresponding anilines. For instance, Tsukuda and co-workers found that partially oxidized Ir clusters with nominal sizes of 15, 30 and 60 atoms could selectively hydrogenate the -NO2 group of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde to 2-aminobenzaldehyde and anthranil [183]. They also found that the selectivity toward 2-aminobenzaldehyde over anthranil increased as the cluster size decreased. This size-dependent phenomenon has been explained as that the smaller clusters had a higher population of the Ir(0) phase, and this was more efficient for reducing hydroxylamine intermediate than intramolecular heterocyclization. Single-atom and nanocluster catalysts such as Ni-N-C-700, pseudo-SAC 0.08%Pt/FeOx-R250, and PdsNC/PN-CeO2 [5,142,143], which have been reviewed in the previous chapter, also showed outstanding selectivity on selectively hydrogenated the -NO2 groups of nitrobenzaldehyde or nitroacetophenone."
17,Reductions with other reductants,"5.2 Reductions with other reductants The reduction of nitrobenzaldehyde or nitroacetophenone using the hydrogen sources except H2 is regarded as the transfer hydrogenation reaction, which is easier to afford the selective products of aminobenzaldehyde or aminoacetophenone with a broad catalyst tolerance. Various catalysts work in this manner, such as Fe/Fe3C@N6CT-900-1 [148], Fe1/N−C [54], Au@SBA15 [93], Ru-PPT [159], and Pd/GYLPCO [161]. Although controversial, there were some reports for the reduction of nitroaldehyde by hydrazine hydrate. Yun and co-workers reported that Co0.15@C/PC catalyst preferentially activated -NO2 group instead of -CO group using N2H4·H2O as the hydrogen source, but when the reducing agent was NH3·BH3, the result was the opposite [184]. When N2H4·H2O was used to reduce 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and 4-nitroacetophenone to the corresponding amino compounds, this catalyst showed excellent conversion and selectivity. Maleki and co-workers reported that isothiazolone (IT)-functionalized silver/iron oxide (Ag/Fe3O4-IT) catalyst reduced 4-nitrobenzaldehyde to 4-aminobenzaldehyde and achieved excellent yield (96%) using hydrazine hydrate [185]. Gholinejad and co-workers used NaBH4 as a hydrogen source to reduce nitroacetophenone. It is interesting that NaBH4 could reduce ketones in the absence of a catalyst, however, the selectivity may reverse in the presence of a catalyst. They prepared catalysts (Clin@Py-Tzl@Pd) by loading palladium NPs on the clay clinochlore [186]. The synergistic effect of palladium and iron in clinochlore made the catalyst have a reversed chemoselectivity, and the product of nitro-reduction, aminoacetophenone, was obtained with 31% yield. Wang and co-workers anchored well-dispersed Pd NPs on g-C3N4 nanosheets [187]. When the catalyst was used to reduce nitroacetophenone, the reaction could be carried out at room temperature using HCOOH as a hydrogen donor, and the selectivity of aminoacetophenone was greater than 99%. Dong and co-workers synthesized a Co@NC-600 °C catalyst [188], and the N atoms and Co NPs in the catalyst displayed a synergistic effect in reducing 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and 4-nitroacetophenone with HCOOH. The selectivity of the obtained corresponding amino compounds was all > 99%. Generally, as a carboxylic acid, the formic acid is at higher oxidation states than aldehydes and ketones, so the ability of formic acid to reduce aldehydes and ketones is not strong. Therefore, it has natural selectivity towards nitro group. Recently, Sun and co-workers reported a Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-CoCu@UiO-66 catalyst for the selective reduction of nitrobenzaldehydes to the corresponding nitrobenzyl alcohols using isopropanol as a hydrogen source [189]. This catalyst exhibited high conversion and selectivity. Importantly, a six-membered ring transition state may form during the reaction, which indicates this is a catalytic transfer hydrogenation without generating adsorbed H* on the catalyst."
18,Chemoselective reduction of nitrobenzonitrile and nitrophenylacetylene,"Nitrophenylacetylene and nitrobenzonitrile are also two important substrates for testing the performance of heterogeneous catalysts, and the corresponding amine compounds are of great significance to industrial production. Triple bonds and nitrile groups are active groups in the reduction, which will cause great difficulties for the selective reduction of -NO2 groups in nitrophenylacetylene or nitrobenzonitrile. So far, many studies have been reported for overcoming this challenge. The catalysts using various hydrogen sources for selective reduction of nitrophenylacetylene and nitrobenzonitrile are summarized in Table 5."
19,Reduction with NH3·BH3,"6.1 Reduction with NH3·BH3 Since the alkynyl group is easily reduced to double bonds and single bonds, hydrogenation of nitrophenylacetylene to aminophenylacetylene usually produces many by-products. Therefore, high-performance catalysts have attracted broad research attention. Zhang and co-workers prepared isolated contiguous Pt atoms in the Pt-Zn intermetallic nanoparticles [192]. Pt atoms and Zn atoms were arranged at intervals, and they were supported on hollow N-doped carbon nanotubes (PtZn/HNCNT). The PtZn/HNCNT catalyst achieved higher catalytic performance for reducing 4-nitrophenylacetylene to 4-aminophenylacetylene using NH3·BH3 compared to the Pt single-atom sites and Pt NPs. The intermetallic arrangement changed the adsorption characteristics of the surface. By DFT computation, the positive Zn atoms assisted the adsorption of -NO2 group. Moreover, Pt-Zn intermetallic NPs dynamically facilitated the hydrogenation of -NO2 group, but simple doping often failed to explore the internal relationship between bimetals. In addition, NH3·BH3 as a hydrogen source has also been studied for the reduction of nitrobenzonitrile. Metin and co-workers synthesized FePd alloy NPs and assembled them on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) [193]. The rGO-Fe48Pd52 catalyst achieved > 99% yield for reducing 4-nitrobenzonitrile to 4-aminobenzonitrile."
20,Reduction with HCOONH4 and H2,"6.2 Reduction with HCOONH4 and H2 By adjusting the content ratio of bimetallic catalyst PdCd and hydrogen sources (HCOONH4 or H2), the products of selectively reduced nitrophenylacetylene will be significantly different. Xu and co-workers studied the catalytic performance of selective hydrogenation of nitrophenylacetylene with different components of PdCdx nanocubes and different hydrogen sources ( Fig. 11) [194]. They found that when hydrogen was used as a hydrogen donor, the main products of PdCd0.82, PdCd0.67 and PdCd0.53 NCs were nitrostyrene (NS), nitroethylbenzene (NEY) and ethylaniline (EA), respectively. This indicated that the hydrogenation sequence was alkynyl > vinyl > nitryl under H2. However, when using HCOONH4, the hydrogenation sequence was nitryl > alkynyl > vinyl. As the Cd content increased, the activity of the catalyst gradually decreased whether using H2 or HCOONH4. This work exactly described the natural selectivity of different hydrogen sources, as well as how the preferential adsorption affected the reactions. Corma and co-workers compared the adsorption of -NO2 and -CN groups on the nanoparticles. They found that different nanoparticles shapes will cause a little change in the adsorption of -NO2 group [18]. This showed that the -NO2 group was a non-structure-sensitive group, but the nitrile group was a structure-sensitive group. According to this, they continuously optimized the characteristics of the crystal surface, thereby dramatically improved the chemoselectivity of the metal Pt catalyst. Therefore, the chemoselectivity to 4-aminobenzonitrile was 98.6% at nearly complete conversion with 0.2 wt% Pt/TiO2 catalyst. Keane and co-workers compared the catalytic performance of Au/ZrO2 and Au/Al2O3 for hydrogenation of 4-nitrobenzonitrile under 1 atm H2 [195]. They found that the Au/ZrO2 catalyst reached 100% yield to produce 4-aminobenzonitrile, and showed a higher TOF than Au/Al2O3, which was due to greater H2 chemisorption capacity. They also reported a Mo2C-supported Au-Pd catalyst (Au-Pd/Mo2C), and it showed 100% selectivity to 4-aminobenzonitrile [196]. Li and co-workers developed a single-atom Fe-phosphorus-carbon (Fe-P-C) catalyst [197], and SAC Fe-P900-PCC achieved 99% yield for the selective reduction of 4-nitrobenzonitrile to 4-aminobenzonitrile."
21,Reductions with other reductants,"6.3 Reductions with other reductants As mentioned in above chapters, some transfer hydrogenation catalysts (such as Fe/Fe3C@N6CT-900-1 [148], n-CeO2 [150], Fe1/N−C [54], and CoSAs/NCNS [174]) also showed excellent chemoselectivity for -NO2 groups on the nitrobenzonitrile and nitrophenylacetylene with N2H4·H2O or HCOOH as hydrogen sources. The natural selectivity of these hydrogen sources guarantees the good selectivity of the amino products. Li and co-workers designed and synthesized a N-doped carbon supported FeOx catalyst (FeOx@CN-hpes) [198], which was obtained by pyrolyzing the N-containing Fe@HMTA/CNFs composites. When using N2H4·H2O to provide active hydrogen, the selectivity of reducing nitrobenzonitrile was greater than 99.7%. Liu and co-workers prepared a nanocatalyst (Pd@PANI) with ultra-low precious metal loading (0.048 wt% Pd) [199]. Polyaniline was not only a support but also a nitrogen-containing ligand to synergistically increase the performance of the catalyst. When using NaBH4 to selectively reduce nitrobenzonitrile, the yield of aminobenzonitrile was 63%. However, the C-Pd-Fe3O4 [200] and Pd/Fe3O4@C [50] catalysts, reported by Jin et al. and Liu et al. respectively, showed excellent performance (98% selectivity, and 100% conversion) in reducing 4-nitrobenzonitrile to 4-aminobenzonitrile using NaBH4 as a hydrogen source. Moreover, bimetallic catalysts have also been reported for the reduction of nitrobenzonitriles using NaBH4. For example, Xi and co-workers synthesized bimetallic Pd-Fe NPs confined in the interface of carbon nanotubes/N-doped carbon (CNT/PdFe/NC) [169]. This catalyst had higher catalytic activity than the mono-metal counterparts and reduced 4-nitrobenzonitrile to 4-aminobenzonitrile with a yield of 99.9%. Zhao and co-workers anchored cobalt NPs on the N-doped carbon [10]. Most of N atoms were presented as graphitic N and pyridinic N. The Co NPs were enfolded by N-doped carbon layers, so the protection and dispersion of the support made this catalyst show excellent activity. When HCOOH was used as a naturally selective hydrogen donor, the selectivity of aminobenzonitrile reached 99.5%."
22,Conclusions and perspectives,"Selectively catalytic reduction of substituted nitroarenes to the corresponding anilines is an important reaction, as the control of selectivity is the key factor for achieving the atom-economic reaction. Especially, the efficient and selective reduction of -NO2 group is a huge challenge when additional one or more reducible groups present in the same molecule. Therefore, the discussion in the catalytic selective (transfer) hydrogenation of these molecules is vital in both the in-depth research of catalysts and industrial products supply. Several important reactions regarding the selective reduction of nitrostyrene, halonitrobenzene, nitrobenzaldehyde, nitroacetophenone, nitrobenzonitrile, and nitrophenylacetylene to the corresponding anilines have been discussed and reviewed here. Their selectivity is affected by the hydrogen sources (H2, N2H4·H2O, NaBH4, NH3·BH3, HCOOH, etc) and metal catalysts (nanocatalysts with mono precious or non-precious metal component, binary metal components, and single-atom and nanocluster catalysts). We have given such a blueprint about the selectivity sequence for diverse hydrogen sources: the more protonic active hydrogen in the molecule, the better its natural selectivity towards nitro group reduction (N2H4·H2O > HCOOH > NaBH4, NH3·BH3 > H2). We have also summarized that intrinsic selectivity and preferential adsorption are two crucial factors to influence the selectivity of nanocatalysts. For improving the selectivity, it requires reasonable preparation and modification of metal catalysts. A lot of effective approaches have been developed, including adjustment of the metal-support interactions, confinement of metals in the pores of the supports, modification of metals with non-metallic elements (N, S, P, etc.), construction of bimetallic alloys or intermetallics, formation of single-atom catalysts, and so on. Although great breakthrough has been made in the recent 10 years on the selectively catalytic reduction of nitroarenes to the corresponding anilines in the presence of other reducible groups, there are still challenges in many aspects: 1. Better understanding of the effect of active hydrogen on selectivity. Different hydrogen sources have different activities. Unlike H2, most organic hydrogen donors have milder hydrogenation activity, which is beneficial for selectivity control [25]. Moreover, active hydrogen species produced by other hydrogen sources are easier than those produced by H2 dissociation. Although we have given such a blueprint about the selectivity sequence for diverse hydrogen sources, there is still a long way to make clear the effect of active hydrogen on selectivity. Obviously, the active hydrogen species are not always the same from the different hydrogen source, therefore, the essential difference still needs to be studied and clarified. How the active hydrogen species is produced, and how they act on the selective reduction of nitroarenes containing other reducible group still requires more investigation. Currently, the use of hydrogen as a hydrogen source requires high pressure in most cases, and this will be unsafe and strict with the equipment. Mastering the unique active H species may find a way to use hydrogen under normal pressure like other hydrogen donors. These challenges need to be systematically studied and overcome by appropriate technology and design. 2. Keeping a balance between selectivity and activity. It is very challenging to achieve both high selectivity and activity for the reduction of nitro group in nitroarenes containing other reducible groups. This is because increasing activity usually results in the decrease of selectivity, or enhancing selectivity usually comes with the expense of activity. This seems to be difficult to establish a balance between selectivity and activity. For example, metal catalysts with good hydrogenation activity such as Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, or Ni generally suffer low selectivity on hydrogenating -NO2 group. Moreover, some effective approaches to improve selectivity of metal catalysts will lead to sacrifice of certain activity in many cases, such as modification of metals with S element, or construction of certain bimetallic alloys or intermetallics. Therefore, for achieving both high activity and selectivity, it is necessary to develop more novel strategies to design and fabricate more efficient and selective metal catalysts. Recently, both single-atom catalysts and catalysts that confine metals in the pores of the supports have shown excellent catalytic performance for selective catalytic hydrogenation, and they can become promising approaches in keeping the balance between selectivity and activity. 3. Achieving research results from laboratory to industrial application. At present, although many achievements have been made in the selective reduction of nitroarenes containing other reducible groups to the corresponding anilines, they often stay in the laboratory and are far from industrial production. Realizing industrial applications generally needs to meet many conditions such as economy, safety, environmental protection, and so on. However, many metal catalysts are expensive and complex in process to fabricate, and even their productivity is so poor that the catalytic reaction system cannot be scaled up. In addition, the stability and durability of some metal catalysts need to be improved. Sometimes the application conditions of some catalysts are very harsh, which results in the reaction system not green enough. In view of these, future research may consider optimizing the process and the cost in the catalyst preparation, and using atom-efficient and inexpensive hydrogen under selective licensing. In order to be more suitable for industrial applications, metal catalysts can be used for scale-up reaction studies with selective reduction of nitroarenes containing other reducible groups under continuous flow."
