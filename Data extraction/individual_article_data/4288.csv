0,Introduction,"Developing sustainable technologies is necessary to reduce environmental pollutants and mitigate climate change caused by high carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations owing to industrialization [1]. Of the various methods used, the electrolytic process provides several advantages that complement the conventional technique. For example, it employs mild operating conditions and atom-efficient strategies for selective conversion using electrons as reactants, which are known as oxidation and reduction steps [2]. Further, as no harmful or toxic chemical agents are used, it efficiently minimizes social and environmental damage [3–5]. Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) employs a mild operating temperature and pressure and is thus is a promising electrolytic process for producing value-added chemicals from waste CO2 [6–8]. Energy-dense molecules are converted by the ECR process, and these can be selectively controlled by controlling the electrochemical conditions and developing the electrocatalyst materials. In addition, the ECR process can be easily scaled up [9]. It has thus become an important technology for reducing the accumulation of CO2. It has no carbon footprint, and it can be used in combination with renewable energy, such as that obtained by solar, wind, and hydroelectric power systems [6,9,10]. The development of electrocatalysts has been the primary focus of many ECR process studies [11–13] because the final product can be controlled depending on the type of electrocatalyst applied. For example, Au-and Ag-based materials are the most well-known electrocatalysts for producing carbon monoxide (CO) from CO2 [14,15], and Cu-based electrocatalysts produce multiple carbons such as ethylene, ethanol, and butanol [11–13]. In the traditional ECR process, suppression of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the cathode is crucial when designing electrocatalysts that provide a CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with high selectivity and activity. The HER has a competing reaction with the CO2RR, and this is caused by the comparable equilibrium potential of the CO2RR and HER [10,16,17]. However, the HER in the ECR process is not a barrier to producing syngas, which is a mixture of hydrogen (H2) and CO, and various chemicals and fuels can be produced using different H2/CO ratios [18,19]. An H2/CO ratio of below 2 is generally used to synthesize engineered products such as methanol, ethanol, and aldehydes [12–15], and a syngas of H2/CO ratio of over 50 is the most suitable for generating power and producing hydrogen [21,22]. However, the conventional syngas production process involves natural gas and coal gasification and it consumes a larger amount of energy [15,23]. By contrast, syngas production using the ECR process provides various advantages, such as energy efficiency under mild conditions, high selectivity by controlling the H2/CO ratio, and achieving carbon neutrality. Despite the list of advantages mentioned above, commercialization of the ECR process depends on several factors [6,24]. The cell operating voltage is one of the most crucial factors, as it determines the total amount of energy consumed by the electrolyzer. In previous reports of ECR systems, an anodic OER was coupled with a cathodic CO2RR in a CO2 saturated environment [25,26]. However, to decrease the total energy consumption (or the cell voltage) of ECR systems, an ultra-highly active OER electrocatalyst is required, but it has not been developed in the past decade. Therefore, a new systematic approach is necessary to overcome these technical barriers. In this study, we designed a new ECR process involving a co-electrolyzer of CO2RR coupled with an anodic ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) instead of using an anodic OER. Ammonia is used in various applications and is thus released in diverse places, such as in agricultural runoff, industrial aqueous effluents, gaseous emissions, and domestic sewage. It contributes to the eutrophication of rivers, generates an odor, and is used in the disinfection of drinking water [27]. The demand for ammonia capture and recycling technologies has gradually increased because waste ammonia is a serious threat to the environment and human health. We discovered the thermodynamic advantage of the electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) when coupling the AOR with the ECR process. Thermodynamically, the OER occurs at 1.23 VRHE, but the AOR occurs at 0.06 VRHE, and it thus has a lower overvoltage. In addition, the AOR requires only 33 MJ of energy to generate the same amount of H2 as conventional water electrolysis, which requires 180 MJ of energy [28]. This means that the ECR process coupled with the AOR can be operated at a lower cell voltage than the traditional ECR process associated with the OER, which results in lower consumption of energy and the high utilization of both CO2 and ammonia to produce valuable syngas [29]. This paper discusses the factors affecting the low energy consumption and the controllable ratio of H2/CO on the co-electrolytic process in the ECR and AOR."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Pt/C anode & Au cathode,"2.1 Preparation of Pt/C anode & Au cathode To prepare the Pt/C electrode, a commercial Pt/C catalyst (TEC10C50E, Tanaka, 46.7 wt%) was dispersed in a mixture of 17.3 mg Pt/C catalyst, 173.4 mg ultra-high purity deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm, Simplicity® UV Water Purification System, type I, Merck), 13.87 mg Nafion solution (10 wt% in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich), and 1750 mg isopropyl alcohol. The ink mixture was sonicated for 20 min and air-dried on a hydrophilic carbon substrate (MGL 190, AvCarb). An Au electrode was prepared using a sputtering method (SC7460, Quorum), in which a hydrophilic carbon gas diffusion layer (GDL) (MGL 190, AvCarb) for H-type cell electrolysis and a PTFE treated hydrophobic GDL (22BB, Sigracet) were used for near zero-gap cell electrolysis [14]. Operation conditions of 1 kV and 20 A for 5 min resulted in a 100 nm thick Au layer. The geometric area of each anode and cathode was 4 cm2 for the H-type cell experiment and 9 cm2 for the near-zero-gap cell experiment."
3,Electrochemical CO2 electrolysis experiment,"2.2 Electrochemical CO2 electrolysis experiment A potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTA30, Autolab) was used to control the cathode and anode currents by measuring the resulting potential. A two-electrode system was employed to measure the cell voltage, and a cation exchange membrane (Nafion 115, DuPont) was used as a separator between the anode and cathode compartments. For the catholyte, potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3, Sigma-Aldrich) solution was used as the electrolyte buffer for CO2RR, and an ammonia solution (NH3 30 wt%, Junsei Chemical) was mixed in variable concentrations with 0.5 M KHCO3. The amount of catholyte was 75 mL, and 70 mL of electrolyte was contained in the anolyte in a near-zero gap cell. During the experiment, the cell temperature was maintained at 25 °C, and high-purity CO2 gas (99.999%) was supplied to the cathode at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. The anolyte was continuously pumped through the channel at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1."
4,Product analysis,"2.3 Product analysis To analyze the gaseous products, 300 μl of sampled gas was loaded into an impact syringe, and this then flowed directly into the gas chromatograph and mass spectroscopy analyzer. Hydrogen was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890A, Agilent Technologies) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and other hydrocarbons were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS, Agilent Technologies) with a GS-GASPRO column (Agilent Technologies) at a column temperature in the range of 298 K to 330 K at a ramping rate of 5 K min−1. GC–MS identified hydrogen (H2) at a retention time of 1.69 min, and CO at 1.3 min. Liquid products, such as formate, were analyzed using UV–Vis spectroscopy (UV-1800, Shimadzu). The Faradaic efficiency (FE) was calculated to identify how efficiently the current applied to the electrochemical cell was assigned to the desired electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, and the following equation was employed in this respect, F E A = Q A Q where FEA is the FE toward product A, QA is the partial charge participating in the formation of A in coulombs, and Q is the total electric charge applied to the electrochemical cell. QA is calculated according to the physical law of electrochemistry as follows, Q A : n A ∙ F ∙ z where nA is the product A in mole, F is the Faraday constant (96,485C/gmol), and z is the valence number of electrons in the electrochemical reaction. In addition, Q is calculated as the sum of the current as follows, Q = ∫ 0 t I τ d τ where t is the total operation time of the electrochemical reduction reaction."
5,Results and discussion,"As the total energy consumption of the CO2 electrolyzer strongly relies on the cell voltage, it is necessary to optimize all parameters to decrease the cell overpotential. In the conventional electrolytic CO2RR process, the overall cell voltage is thermodynamically over 1.3 V as described below, (1) CO2 + 2 H+ + 2 e− → CO + H2O, cathodic reaction @ −0.1 VRHE (2) 2 H2O → O2 + 4 H+ + 4 e−, anodic reaction @ 1.23 VRHE Eqs. (1) and (2) show that a sluggish OER on the anode side limits the highly effective conversion of CO2 to chemicals. With respect to the thermodynamic behavior, the most efficient method is to replace the OER (Eq. (2)) with the AOR, as shown in Eq. (3), (3) 2 NH3 + 6 OH− → N2 + 6 H2O + 6 e−, anodic reaction @ 0.06 VRHE An anodic potential ranging from 0.6 to 0.9 V vs. RHE (depending on the type of electrocatalyst) has been determined using state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for the AOR, and the potential range has been proven to be much lower than that for the OER (from 1.4 to 1.7 V vs. RHE) [30]. Therefore, it has been demonstrated that incorporating the AOR on the anode coupled with CO2RR on the cathode is an efficient strategy for decreasing the cell voltage. However, we hypothesized that the amount of hydrogen that evolves at the cathode could be slightly increased if the lower overvoltage of the HER was used instead of the CO2RR, with respect to the total cell voltage decrease. Suppressing the HER on the cathode is critical for the efficient conversion of CO2 in a conventional CO2RR system. However, as previously mentioned, the HER is useful for producing syngas. Also, protons produced from the NH3 oxidation could move through the cation exchange membrane to the catholyte, then a favorable HER environment would be created on the cathode side. Based on these hypotheses, we incorporated the AOR instead of the conventional OER in a CO2RR system, and to investigate the effects of incorporating the AOR in the CO2RR system, we conducted an electrochemical analysis using two different types of cells, a batch- and a flow-type, depending on the experimental aim, as shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (c). The H-type cell was employed, as it is a widely used batch type electrolytic cell, and the near-zero-gap cell was used as the flow-type cell [12–14,31]. H-type batch cells are especially suitable for evaluating the electrochemical behaviors of synthesized electrocatalysts, and for analyzing gas and liquid product formation, including CO, formic acid, and hydrocarbons. Therefore, an H-type cell is generally employed when conducting fundamental electrochemical and product analyses, without considering the low Faradaic efficiency and smaller electrode compartment volume. By contrast, a higher current density can be used with the near-zero-gap cell as a flow type cell, which maximizes the cell efficiency. Unlike with the H-type cell, gas-phase CO2 can be continuously injected, and the total ohmic resistance of the cell is smaller because the distance between the electrodes and membranes can be decreased [17]. Therefore, the near-zero-gap cell is suitable for demonstrating the performance-enhancing factors obtained using the H-type cell and to prove the feasibility of its practical utilization [14,32]. Fig. 1 shows the two types of electrochemical cells used in this study. Both cells were assembled by stacking an Au-coated gas diffusion electrode (GDE) as the cathode, a Pt/C coated GDE as the anode [33], and employing a cation exchange membrane (Nafion 115, DuPont). The only difference between the two cells was the degree of the GDE’s hydrophilicity, the continuous or discontinuous supply of reactants, NH3 on the anode, and CO2 on the cathode, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (b) and (d). It is of note that the hydrophilic GDE was employed on the anode in both the H-type and the near-zero-gap cell, whereas in our previous study, hydrophobic GDE was only used on the cathode side in a near-zero-gap cell to provide fluent mass transport [14]. In the experiment, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted by increasing the NH3 concentration in the blank anolyte (BK: CO2 saturated 0.5 M KHCO3). In both the H-type and near-zero-gap cells, we observed that the total cell voltages were proportionally reduced by increasing the NH3 concentration: the cell voltages at 5 mA cm−2 in the H-type cell and near-zero gap cell were reduced from −2.5 V to −2.05 V and from −2.5 V to −1.6 V, respectively, after dosing NH3 at incremental concentrations, as shown in Fig. 2 (a) and (b). A detailed comparison between the results of the two cell types showed a decrease in the total required cell voltages (Fig. 2c), where the near-zero gap cell required a lower cell voltage at all concentrations of NH3 from 0 M to 3 M. This result was due to the lower Relectrolyte of the near-zero-gap cell, which resulted in a lower cell voltage than the H-type cell. We then set the optimal concentration of NH3 to 2 M, because although the 3 M NH3 concentration enabled the lowest voltage according to the LSV curves, it did not remain stable when a constant current was applied in the near-zero-gap cell, as shown in Fig. S1. The potential profile increased suddenly and then fluctuated after the initial 5 min, which could be the result of the severe evolution of gas and the unstable internal pressure at the electrode sides of our homemade cell structure. To compare the degree of cell voltage reduction by incorporating the AOR on the anode side, we applied currents in steps from 10 mA cm−2 to 100 mA cm−2 at increments of 10 mA cm−2, and each step was conducted for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the cell voltage increased from −3.08 V at an initial current of 10 mA cm−2 to −7.36 V at a final current of 100 mA cm−2 in the case of the anolyte without NH3. However, the total cell voltage with 2 M NH3 was lower than that of the cell with the blank electrolyte, and it reached −2.2 V at 10 mA cm−2 and −5.37 V at 100 mA cm−2. We also observed that the cell voltage profiles in the blank anolyte condition fluctuated severely when the current was increased to each incremental value, and this was due to the mounting gas evolution from the electrode. By contrast, the cell voltage profiles were relatively stable in the 2 M NH3 containing anolyte. It might be from the better stability of Pt electrocatalysts on the anode for an AOR than an OER at the relative lower working voltage.[33–35] By polynomial fitting the average cell voltage at each current density, as shown in Fig. 3(b), we derived a correlation between the cell voltage and the current density, and the results are shown in Table S1. We then decided that it would be useful to predict the required cell voltage of the co-electrolyzer for AOR and CO2RR. From the equation in Table S1, the slope of the curve consecutively decreased as the current density increased, because a greater amount of gas evolved on the cathode, and the anode limited the lowering of the cell voltage. When comparing the normalized cell voltage from the blank anolyte, the AOR on the anode reduced the cell voltage in a range of 25% to 35% over the entire current density applied (Fig. S2). Therefore, incorporating the AOR coupled with CO2RR in the co-electrolyzer effectively decreased the amount of energy required by reducing the overvoltage required. Chrono-potentiometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) were conducted to evaluate the AOR and CO2RR co-electrolyzer products based on using the H-type cell for one hour. An Au-sputtered GDE (4 cm2) was used as the cathode and a Pt/C coated GDE (4 cm2) as the anode, and the cation-exchange membrane was also employed, as described in the experimental section. Fig. 4 (a) shows the voltage profiles for different NH3 concentrations in the anolytes. The increase of the NH3 concentration of the anolyte enhanced the effects of the decrease in the cell potential. The highest cell voltage in the blank anolyte was −4.2 V, but this was reduced to −3.6 V by increasing the NH3 concentration to 2 M. In addition, the different NH3 concentrations in the anolyte resulted in variations in the ratios of gas and liquid products compared to the faradaic efficiency (FE) from the co-electrolyzer, as shown in Fig. S3. The main gas products obtained were CO and H2, and a small amount of liquid phase formate (HCOO−) was also obtained. We only considered the gas-phase products, CO and H2, because the ratios of liquid formates were less than 10%, and the ratio of CO to H2 is generally used to evaluate syngas production. Interestingly, the production of H2 was comparatively increased by increasing the NH3 concentration in the anolyte, and this FE tendency increased the H2/CO ratio of the produced syngas, as shown in Fig. 4(b). With respect to the H2/CO ratio, the blank anolyte was less than 1, but the ratios increased linearly to over 2 by increasing the NH3 concentration until 2. H2/CO ratios are critical for indicating the final chemical products of the produced syngas. According to previous reports [15,22], a syngas a ratio of under 1 (H2/CO ≤ 1) is generally used to produce ethanol, and that in a range from 1 to 2 (1 < H2/CO ≤ 2) can be converted to methanol, which can be used for the production of valuable chemicals, such as formaldehyde, dimethylene ether, acetic acid, methyl acetate, and ethylene or propylene, through a successive chemical conversion process. In the Fischer-Tropsch process, syngas with a higher H2/CO ratio (H2/CO > 2) is utilized to produce high-molecule chemicals, such as wax, diesel-kerosene, gasoline, and naphtha [22] Based on the H2/CO ratios obtained in the current study from the co-electrolyzer of CO2RR coupled with AOR, syngas with a high H2/CO ratio can be produced for use in the Ficher-Tropsch process, which is in high demand. To maximize the cell efficiency under high current densities, the flow-type homemade near-zero-gap cell was used to test the cell performance using the 2 M NH3 containing anolyte. As shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b), the effect of the total cell voltage reduction of the near-zero-gap cell with the 2 M NH3 containing anolyte was evident compared to that of the cell with the blank anolyte. For the cell using the blank anolyte, the stable cell voltage profiles of the co-electrolyzer were maintained as follows: at near −3 V at 10 mA cm−1, −4.5 V at 30 mA cm−1, and −5.5 V at 50 mA cm−1. However, when higher currents were applied at 75 mA cm−1 and 100 mA cm−1, a stable potential profile was only maintained for the initial 10 min (Fig. 5(a)). By contrast to these results, those of the co-electrolyzer using the 2 M NH3 containing anolyte showed much lower cell voltages: −2 V at 10 mA cm−1, −3.5 V at 30 mA cm−1, −4 V at 50 mA cm−1, −5 V at 75 mA cm−1, and −5.5 V at 100 mA cm−1 (Fig. 5(b)). Fig. 5(c) shows the FE results of the liquid and gas products from Fig. 5(a) and 5(b). We additionally tested different concentrations of 1.5 M and 3 M NH3 containing anolytes using the near-zero-gap cell to find the optimal NH3 concentration, as shown in Fig. S4. Based on these results, the higher concentration of a 2 M NH3 containing anolyte was found to be the optimal amount for our experimental system. Both cells produced mainly CO and H2 gas products, and small amounts of liquid formates, as shown in Fig. 5(c) and 5(d). It is of note that the higher FE values for CO production compared to that of the H-type batch cell was related to the differences between the cell types. Since the length between the anode to cathode of the near-zero-gap cell was shorter than that of the H-type cell, a more favorable atmosphere for reducing CO2 molecules into CO gas gas-phase CO2 was provided by reducing the ohmic resistance of the cell and CO2 gas flowed directly through the GDE at the cathode. In the co-electrolyzer cell with the blank anolyte, there was no significant increase of H2 or CO FE tendency when the current density was increased, and the FE values for H2 conversion did not exceed 25%, as shown. By contrast, the co-electrolyzer with 2 M NH3 containing anolytes showed a proportional increasing tendency with an increase in the applied current densities. By converting the results of Fig. 5 (c) and 5(d) into the ratios of H2/CO (see in Fig. 5(e)), the 2 M NH3 containing anolytes contributed to an increase in the H2/CO ratio from 0.28 at 10 mA cm−1, 0.6 at 30 mA cm−1, 0.78 at 50 mA cm−1, 1.97 at 75 mA cm−1 and the highest value of 4.1 was reached at 100 mA cm−1, whereas the cell using the blank anolytes did not exceed an H2/CO ratio of 0.25 over any of the current densities applied. In addition, Fig. S5 verifies the long-term stability of the co-electrolyzer with CO2RR using the 2 M NH3 containing anolyte under an applied current of 100 mA cm−2 for over 3 h, where the cell voltage profile was stable at near −5.5 V (Fig. S5 (a)). The H2/CO ratio was also saturated at nearly 4 after 1 h, as displayed in Fig. S55(b). This indicates that the concentration of NH3 and the applied current density are crucial factors controlling the ratio of H2 and CO gas products. In our homemade near-zero-gap cell experimental system, a 2 M NH3 containing anolyte with an applied current density of 100 mA cm−2 produced syngas with the highest H2/CO ratio of 4.1. By conducting a quantitative calculation based on our FE values, the result using 2 M NH3 containing anolyte under 100 mA cm−1 current density showed that the production rate of 11.85 L per hour for H2 and 3.88 L per hour for CO in the near-zero-gap cell when the total volume was 1 m3. We thus expect that the concept of the CO2RR co-electrolyzer coupled with AOR could be adjustable to produce highly valuable syngas on-site for the Fischer-Tropsch process [19,20]."
6,Conclusions,"In this study, we designed a new system known as a co-electrolyzer that couples the CO2RR with the AOR. The thermodynamic AOR potential is much lower than that of the conventional OER, and it is sufficient for decreasing the required cell voltage of the co-electrolyzer designed in this work. Our results demonstrate that the overall cell voltages of the co-electrolyzer can be thermodynamically and experimentally decreased by controlling the NH3 concentration and applied current density. Compared to using the OER, the thermodynamic lower overvoltage of the AOR enables a decrease in the total cell operation voltage of a maximum of 34.03% following an increase in the NH3 concentration and applied current. We also found that syngas with different H2/CO ratios (0.25 to 4.1) can be produced in relation to changes in the applied current in the presence of 2 M NH3 at the anolyte. Given the highest H2/CO ratio obtained in this work, the co-electrolytic process developed in this study is comparable to that required for the conventional Fischer-Tropsch process, in which syngas with a higher H2/CO value of two is generally necessary. These results indicate that the approach of coupling CO2RR with AOR to efficiently lower the Vcell provides a new perspective for solving the challenges of ECR engineering development, and it contributes to reducing harmful quantities of NH3 and CO2. We anticipate that applying renewable energy to this system could enable the development of E-fuel (electro fuel), which has been recently heralded as an environmentally friendly fuel."
