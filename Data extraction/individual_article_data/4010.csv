0,Introduction,"Titanium and its alloys, especially binary titanium alloys (i.e., α/β titanium alloys), have been proven to be technically superior and cost-effective materials [1–3] and thus, have been widely used in aerospace, aviation, navigation, chemical, and petrochemical industries [4–9]. Compared to other metallic materials, titanium and its alloys have superior corrosion properties in the marine environments [2]. To pursue the new titanium alloys with super mechanical and corrosion properties, element alloying is found to be one of the effective methods by the change of the chemical composition of titanium alloys, their microstructure, and the structure and properties of passive films [7,10]. Although titanium and its alloys generally possess excellent corrosion resistance, they have been demonstrated to be highly susceptible to both gaseous [11–13] and cathodic [14–18] hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC). Hydrogen diffuses into the matrix of titanium and its alloys, reacts with Ti to form hydride because of its high affinity to titanium. Three different kinds of titanium hydrides, i.e. δ, ε and γ hydrides, can form in the titanium matrix [19–24]. At the locations where hydride forms, stress concentration occurs due to the volume expansion by the formation of hydrides, leading to the cleavage of brittle hydrides and thus initiation of the HIC [24]. In the marine environments, titanium-made components may be attacked by hydrogen atoms during service, which are produced by the galvanic corrosion between titanium-made components and carbon steel. Under these circumstances, titanium alloys can be subjected to hydrogen uptake and subsequently suffer the HIC [16,25,26]. It has been reported that both the α phases and the α/β interfaces are the locations where HIC preferentially occurs [1]. The occurrence of the HIC deteriorates the strength and ductility of titanium and its alloys [27,28]. Even a small amount of hydrogen, not necessarily sufficient to form titanium hydrides, might change the electrochemical corrosion behavior of titanium and its alloys, and eventually lead to material failure when trapped inside [29,30]. Hydrogen charging is the common method to be used to investigate the HIC susceptibility of titanium and its alloys [31,32]. The permeation of the charged hydrogen can change the structure and composition of the passive films formed on the surfaces of titanium and its alloys, and also lead to the formation of titanium hydrides [15]. The composition of the passive films transforms from titanium oxides to a mixture of titanium oxides and titanium hydrides and finally to entirely titanium hydrides [15], via the reaction below [16,30,33]: (1) Ti O 2 + ( x +4 ) H → Ti H x +2 H 2 O In the past few decades, Ti-6Al-4 V alloy was developed to have outstanding mechanical properties and corrosion resistance with a good prospect to serve as a structural material in the marine environment. Recently, new titanium alloys have been designed to reduce the material cost without sacrificing the mechanical and corrosion properties. Since iron is much cheaper than other alloying elements [34] but also has a distinctive performance in solid solution strengthening [35], the low-cost Ti alloys were developed by partial substitution of vanadium and aluminum with iron [36]. The mechanical properties of the low-cost Ti-6Al-1.2Fe alloy are comparable to these of Ti-6Al-4 V alloy at room temperature [34]. Scanlan et al. [37] reported that Ti-5Al-1.5Fe-1.4Cr-1.2Mo exhibited superior yield and ultimate strengths than the Ti-6Al-4 V alloy. In the investigation about the mechanical properties and electrochemical corrosion behavior of low-cost Ti-4.5Al-xV-yFe alloys, Michael et al. [36] reported that the mechanical properties of these alloys were comparable to the commercial Ti-6Al-4 V alloy, but their corrosion resistance was significantly improved. Bodunrin et al. compared the corrosion behavior of a low cost Ti-6Al-xV-yFe alloy to that of the commercial Ti-6Al-4 V alloy, and found that partial replacement of vanadium with 2 wt.%–3 wt.% iron yielded an excellent corrosion resistance and this alloy can be an alternative to the Ti-6Al-4 V alloy used in marine environments [38]. Recently, A low-cost Ti-4Al-2V-1Mo-1Fe (Ti4211) alloy containing less vanadium and aluminum but more molybdenum and iron has been developed as a potential alternative to the Ti-6Al-4 V alloy. This alloy can not only greatly reduce the production cost, but also have similar corrosion resistance to the Ti-6Al-4 V alloy [5]. However, the susceptibility of hydrogen and its influence on the corrosion behavior of this titanium alloy in the marine environment are unclear. It is generally accepted that hydrogen evolution has a certain universality for chemical reactions in the marine environment. Since titanium and its alloys are widely used in the marine environment, it is of great significance to study on the corrosion damage of titanium alloys subjected to the marine environment and to investigate the effect of element alloying (i.e., Mo and Fe, with an abundant amount on earth and at a low cost) on their mechanical and corrosion properties. This will be greatly beneficial to the development of titanium alloys having superior mechanical properties and promising corrosion resistance. Hence, this work aimed to investigate the susceptibility of this newly-developed Ti4211 alloy to hydrogen and HIC, revealing the influence of hydrogen on the composition and structure of passive film, the formation of the hydrides and its growth under cathodic polarized conditions, and the effect of hydride formation and HIC initiation on the corrosion performance."
1,Experimental procedure,"The material used in the present study was a Ti4211 alloy fabricated by the Institute of Metal Research (IMR), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China. The chemical composition (wt.%) of this alloy was 3.96 % aluminum (Al), 2.03 % vanadium (V), 1.05 % molybdenum (Mo), 0.92 % iron (Fe), and balanced titanium. The preparation methods of the Ti4211 alloy used in the present work had been described in detail in our previous work [5]. Samples were cut into coupons with dimensions of 10 mm × 10 mm × 4 mm. The samples were coated with epoxy, leaving an exposed surface area of 1 cm2. Subsequently, the specimen was successively ground to 4000-grit emery paper, etched in Kroll reagent (3 mL HF, 9 mL HNO3, and 88 mL H2O) for 10 s, and finally rinsed using distilled water and ethyl alcohol. A hydrogen charging experiment was performed in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution prepared using analytical-grade NaCl and distilled water at 25 ± 1 °C (controlled by a thermostat water bath). During this process, standard three electrode cell was employed, the specimen acting as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, 0.242 VSHE) as the reference electrode, and a platinum plate as the counter electrode [39]. The specimens were charged using a CS2350H electrochemical workstation (Wuhan Corrtest Instruments Corp., Ltd. Wuhan, China) with different hydrogen charging times (i.e., 0, 1, 4, and 24 h) with a constant current density of 50 mA/cm2 since the concentration of diffusible hydrogen in the Ti specimens would be higher at a higher charging current density and the application of high charging current density (i.e., 50 mA/cm2) had been proven to be a proper method to study the susceptibility of Ti alloys to HIC [14,29,40]. During the cathodic hydrogen charging, the steady-state potential of the sample was approximately -1.1 VSCE. Then, the specimens were quickly rinsed with distilled water and alcohol, and stored in a desiccator for the following experiments. The electrochemical tests were also performed in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution to simulate the marine atmosphere. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted with a sinusoidal potential perturbation of 10 mV and a frequency range from 105 to 10−2 Hz. The potentiodynamic polarization test was carried out from -0.5 VSCE below the open circuit potential (OCP) of the Ti4211 alloy to an anodic limit of 1.5 VSCE or 3 VSCE at a scan rate of 0.1667 mV/s. All electrochemical experiments were repeated at least three times in naturally aerated 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution without stirring to ensure the data reproducibility. The electrochemical data obtained were then analyzed using Cview and Zview software. The microstructural constituents of the charged and uncharged samples were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The XRD experiments were carried out using a D/Max 2400 X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with copper Kα radiation at 10 kV and 35 mA at a step size of 0.02° and a scan rate of 4°/min. The DSC experiments were performed using a TG-DSC STA 449F3 Jupiter® (NETZSCH Instruments) from 200 to 400 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the charged and corroded samples were observed by a Keyence VHX-700 (Keyence Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (XL30-FEG ESEM, FEI, Hillsboro, OR., USA) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)."
2,Results,
3,Microstructure characterization,"3.1 Microstructure characterization The microstructure and the EDS analyses of the phases in the Ti4211 alloy are shown in Fig. 1 . It showed that this alloy consisted of the dark α phase and the grey β phase distributing along grain boundary, Fig. 1(a). Their chemical compositions (the α phase, Fig. 1(b); and the β phase, Fig. 1(c)) are presented in Table 1 . It showed that Fe and Mo mainly enriched in the β phase while the V content in the β phase was higher than that in the α phase. This is consistent with the well-recognized principle that Fe, Mo and V are the stabilizers of the β phase [7,35,41]."
4,Hydride characterization,"3.2 Hydride characterization Fig. 2 (a) shows the XRD results of the charged and uncharged Ti4211 alloy, and Fig. 2(b) is the sections of XRD analyses in Fig. 2(a) with the scanning angle from 33° to 43° to better display the characteristic peaks of hydrides. The diffraction peaks for the uncharged Ti4211 alloy corresponded to the peaks of the α phase with a hexagonal close-packed (h.c.p.) lattice and these of the β phase with a body-centered cubic (b.c.c.) lattice [42]. This is consistent with the microstructural observation of the Ti4211 alloy presented in Fig. 1. After the Ti4211 alloy was charged for 1 h, some new peaks were present, and these peaks are associated with the formation of a new type of hydride, the δ-TiH2 phase. When the hydrogen charging time reached 4 h, the δ-TiH2 and γ-TiH phases [43], which have a body-centered cubic (f.c.c.) structure and are stable at room temperature [44,45], were detected. The characteristic peaks corresponding to the β phase slightly shifted toward the lower angles as the charging time increased, suggesting the high hydrogen solubility [1,46] and trapping characteristic [47–49] which led to the lattice expansion of the β phase [50]. And the subsequent formation of hydride by the reaction of soluble hydrogen atoms with Ti could further shift the peak position. No obvious shift of the α phase peaks indicates the solubility of hydrogen in the α phase was much lower compared to that in the β phase [51]. Extension of the hydrogen charging time to 24 h led to the increase of the intensities in the characteristic diffraction peaks, indicating the growth of the δ-TiH2 and γ-TiH phases. The disappearance of characteristic diffraction peaks for the α phase suggests that the characteristic diffraction peaks of the δ-TiH2 phase were overlapping with those for the α phase. It is consistent with the work conducted by Luo et al. [52] that the δ-TiH2 phase was present along the primary α grain boundaries, and its characteristic diffraction peaks were overlapping with those of the α phases in hydrogen-charged samples because of the broadening of the characteristic diffraction peaks. To further verify whether hydrides formed in the Ti4211 alloy and to determine the dependence of hydride growth on the hydrogen charging time, DSC measurements were performed, as shown in Fig. 3 . Neither endothermic peak nor exothermic peak was observed on the DSC curve of the uncharged sample. And an endothermic peak starting at approximately 230 °C, which was attributed to the decomposition of γ-TiH and δ-TiH2 [12,50,52], was present on the DSC curves of the hydrogen-charged samples. Moreover, it can be inferred that both the onset decomposition temperature of hydrides and the total area under the endothermic peaks were strongly dependent on hydrogen charging time. The increase in the total area under the endothermic peak with hydrogen charging time indicates that the heat absorbed by alloy to decompose hydrides increased and hence the content of the hydrides formed in the alloy increased with the increase of charging time. This is consistent with the results reported by Eliezer et al. [29], who found that the hydrogen uptake in a duplex Ti-6Al-4 V alloy after electrochemical charging at room temperature increased with the charging time. It can also be deduced from Fig. 3 that the onset decomposition temperature of the hydrides gradually shifted to a higher temperature, suggesting the enhanced hydride stability [12]."
5,Hydrogen-induced cracking,"3.3 Hydrogen-induced cracking Before hydrogen charging, the surface of the Ti4211 alloy was generally smooth and flat, as shown in Fig. 1. However, after the samples were cathodically charged for different times, there were plentiful cracks as marked by the red arrows, mainly distributing in the α phase and along with the α/β interface, as shown in Fig. 4 . This phenomenon agrees well with the results obtained by Berthelemy et al. [53] and Wu et al. [15], who found that abundant HIC cracks appeared on the surface of Ti alloys. The work conducted by Tal-Gutelmacher et al. [1] suggested that these HIC cracks which usually took place in the α phase or/and along the α/β interface during cathodic charging were caused by the formation and rupture of the brittle hydride phases [24,54]. When the sample was cathodically charged for 4 h, the HICs mainly initiated within the α phase and along with the α/β interface, and the propagation of HICs was impeded by the boundaries of the α/β, as shown in Fig. 4(a). However, the β phase remained intact, and no obvious HICs in the β phase were found. The preferential formation of hydrides in the α phase and along the α/β boundaries [1,29] suggested that hydrogen atoms easily reacted with Ti at these locations to form hydrides and their growth would lead to volume expansion since the Pilling-Bedworth ratio of Ti hydride larger than 1 (e.g., PBRTiH2 = 1.25) [55]. This is in consistence with the work conduct by Shen et al. [56] that the volume expansion in the α phase was significantly greater than that in the β phase. The precipitation of hydrides led to the inhomogeneous strain in the α phase due to the differences in specific volumes of δ hydride and matrix [23,57] would accelerate the initiation and propagation of the HIC. With the increased hydrogen charging time, the surface experienced more pronounced HIC cracking, as shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c). Moreover, the retained surface appeared to be highly flimsy. When the charging time reached 24 h, new HIC cracks appeared while the existing cracks continued to propagate in length and width. Although some HICs gradually propagated from the α phase and through the β phase, no material loss was observed, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Clearly, more hydrogen diffused into the Ti4211 alloy, promoted the formation of titanium hydride and accelerated the volume expansion [58]. It is remarkable that HICs in the α phase were more pronounced than the β phase, proving that HIC sensitivity is higher for the α phase. It should be noted that there were no hydrides formed on the sample surfaces, except the sample hydrogen-charged for 24 h (the white deposits marked by the red squares in Fig. 4(d)."
6,Electrochemical response,"3.4 Electrochemical response Fig. 5 (a) shows the Nyquist plots for the charged and uncharged Ti4211 alloy in aerated 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. It can be seen that all plots exhibited an unfinished single capacitive arc, indicating highly capacitive behavior. The capacitive behavior of titanium alloys was dominated by the formation of the passive film [5,59]. And the Bode diagram (Fig. 5(b)) showed one time constant present. These obtained plots were interpreted in terms of an equivalent circuit, Fig. 7. This equivalent circuit was similar to those proposed by Wang et al. [59] for pure titanium immersed in 0.05 M sulfuric acid, Qiao et al. [5] for the Ti-6Al-4 V alloy immersed in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution and Tamilselvi et al. [60] for the Ti-6Al-4 V alloy in Hanks’ solution. The use of a constant phase element (CPE) was necessary because of the distribution of relaxation times resulting from heterogeneities at the electrode surface [61–63]. CPE used to describe the frequency-independent phase shift of applied alternating current (AC) potential [64] has been extensively investigated [61,65], and its impedance can be expressed as Q –1(jω)– n . Therefore, the total impedance of the equivalent circuit in Fig. 7 can be written as below [66]: (2) Z total = R s + ( Q ( j ω ) n + 1 R p ) − 1 where n is the depression angle (in degrees) that evaluates the semicircle deformation, R s is the electrolyte resistance, R p represents the polarization resistance, and CPE corresponds to the capacitance of the passive film (TiO2). The fitted parameters in the equivalent circuit in Fig. 7 are given in Table 2 . It can be seen that the polarization resistance for the uncharged sample was 6.50 × 105 Ω cm2. After hydrogen charging for 1 h, it decreased to 6.44 × 105 Ω cm2, indicating that short-term hydrogen charging had a negligible effect on the corrosion resistance of the alloy. When the sample was charged for 4 h, the R p of the sample continued to decrease, 3.58 × 105 Ω cm2. With the extension of hydrogen charging time (i.e., 24 h), the R p was approximately 10 % of that for the uncharged sample, 6.18 × 104 Ω cm2. It indicated that the protective performance of passive film on the Ti4211 alloy surface deteriorated and the risk of corrosion increased. Fig. 7 shows the potentiodynamic polarization curves of the uncharged Ti4211 sample in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution and the ones charged for different times. Generally, the curve gradually shifted to the right side (the side with a high current density) with the charging time. This shift suggests that the formation of hydrides accelerated the electrochemical process, especially the anodic reaction [15]. It can also be seen that all of the plots exhibited a passive region, but the potential range of the passive region became smaller with the increase of charging time. It suggested that the hydrogen charging had a negative effect on the protection of the passive film. The corrosion parameters, including corrosion potential (E corr), corrosion current density (i corr), pitting potential (E pit), and passive current density (i p) values were derived and are listed in Table 3 . Both the i corr and i p gradually increased as the hydrogen charging time increased from 0 h (the uncharged sample) to 24 h. The E corr for the uncharged Ti4211 sample in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution was -0.36 VSCE; as the potential increased, extending over a wide range of potentials, the i p stabilized ∼ 4.75 × 10−6 A/cm2 even when the potential reached 2.64 VSCE. This is consistent with the thermodynamic data that the passive film forming on the surface of the Ti4211 sample is thermodynamically stable [5,67]. The absence of film breakdown in the studied potential range agrees with the work of Dai et al. [68] and Li et al. [58], who reported that no pitting corrosion was observed for Ti-6Al-4 V alloy in NaCl solution at positive anodic potentials. Although the corrosion features of the uncharged Ti4211 alloy in this work are similar to those of selective laser–melted (SLM) Ti-6Al-4 V [69] and ultrafine-grained pure titanium (UFG-Ti) [70], the pitting corrosion resistance of the Ti4211 alloy was much higher than the SLM Ti-6Al-4 V and UFG-Ti. After hydrogen charging for 1 h, the electrochemical characteristics of the Ti4211sample was similar to the uncharged one, except a negative shift of E corr to -0.51 VSCE and an increase of i p to 5.15 × 10−6 A/cm2. These experimental results were consistent with the results reported by Yin et al. [28], who attributed this to the oxidation of hydrogen atoms during anodic polarization. When the charging time extended to 4 h, the passive behavior of the Ti4211 sample changed greatly. The stable passive region of this sample narrowed, from 0.4 to 1.37 VSCE, but i p gradually increased when the potential was scanned to a more positive value. When the potential was scanned to 1.75 VSCE, an anodic current peak was present, which is attributed to the Fe oxide formation [65,71,72]. This corrosion feature had been frequently observed in titanium alloys [71,73,74] and stainless steel [65]. It is worth noting that as the charging time further extended to 24 h, a sudden increase in i p was present, followed by the emergence of film breakdown at a potential of 1.33 VSCE. Luo et al. believed that the oxidation of trapped H atom contributed to the increase of i p and increased carrier density when the scanning potential was higher than the equilibrium potential for the reaction of 2H+ + 2e → H2 in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution [75]. Since hydrogen would diffuse through the passive film, decrease the stability of passive films and hinder the repassivation process [28], the susceptibility of the charged Ti4211 sample to pitting corrosion increased with the increasing hydrogen charging time."
7,Corrosion morphologies,"3.5 Corrosion morphologies After the potentiodynamic polarization test in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution, the morphologies of the Ti4211 alloy charged for 24 h are shown in Fig. 8. The sample surface displayed preferential corrosion attack of the α phase, surrounded by the network of the intact β phases, in Fig. 8(a) and (b). It is consistent with Wu et al.’s work that corrosion preferentially initiated at the α phase [15]. No obvious corrosion of the β phase suggested that the enrichment of Fe and Mo stabilized the β phase, even under strongly-polarized conditions. The depth of the corrosion damage on the surface of the alloy was approximately 1.1 μm, as shown in Fig. 8(c)."
8,Discussion,
9,Formation of hydrides during hydrogen charging,"4.1 Formation of hydrides during hydrogen charging On the basis of the XRD characterization of hydrides (Fig. 2) and the changes in the surface morphologies of the charged Ti4211 samples with the charging time (Fig. 4), it can be stated that two hydrides (i.e., γ-TiH and δ-TiH2) formed in the charged Ti4211 samples. With the increase of the charging time, the topographical observation (Fig. 4) indicated that the hydride formation depended on the microstructure of the Ti4211 alloy and the hydrogen charging time. Element alloying is proven to be an effective method to alter the microstructure of titanium alloys, and further change its HIC susceptibility in corrosive environments. In comparison to the α phase, EDS analyses suggested that Fe, Mo and V, the stabilizers of the β phase [7,35,41], were rich in the β phase. Fe, Mo and V enrichment in the β phase improved the chemical stability and the resistance to HIC, which is consistent with surface observation (Fig. 4) that HIC preferentially initiated at the α phase and along with the α/β phase interface. It required a cross-sectional investigation to further support this. Fig. 9 shows the cross-sectional observations of the Ti4211 sample after hydrogen charging for 24 h, which illustrated the presence of a surface hydride layer and the distribution of hydrides in the depth of the sample. It is clear that more hydrides formed at the near surface of the sample than the rest part. With the increase of the distance to the surface of the sample (same as hydrogen charging interface marked by the red arrows in Fig. 9(a), the hydride content gradually decreased. When the distance to the sample surface was > 1.5 mm, no hydrides were observed. As shown in Fig. 9(b) and (c), hydrides were more likely to form at the α phase and along α/β phase interface, which is consistent with the surface observation in Fig. 4. This was also similar to the observation of the Ti-6Al-4 V alloy after electrochemical hydrogen charging that hydrides preferentially formed at the α phase and along the α/β boundaries [1,14]. The α phase and the boundaries of α/β phase were acting as the effective trapping sites for hydrogen [76,77], whilst the β phase was acting as a short path for hydrogen transport [1,13,16]. Different from the Ti-6Al-4 V alloy [14,31], there were two hydride phases formed in the Ti4211 alloy, the needle-like δ-TiH2 [78] and the floccule γ-TiH, which was confirmed by XRD results in Fig. 2. The needle-like hydride, which was not observed in the charged Ti-6Al-4 V alloy [31], was usually formed in the α phase along its habit plane [44,45]. The Floccule hydride phase was observed to initiate at the α/β boundary and gradually grow to the interior of the α phase. Hence, as the hydrides grew, it would inevitably give priority to the formation of HICs within the α phase (Fig. 4). The hydride formation process in the Ti4211 alloy during hydrogen charging is summarized in Fig. 10. Generally, the surfaces of Ti and its alloys are covered with a layer of compact and chemically-stable oxide film at a thickness of several nanometers, TiO2, which protects the metal substrate [15]. The first step to form hydride is that the hydrogen atoms produced by hydrogen charging must adsorb on the surface of the TiO2 passive film which acts as a transport barrier [10,16], and diffuse through this layer to permeate into the substrate of the Ti4211 alloy. The deterioration of the corrosion resistance of the charged Ti4211alloy, Fig. 8 and Table 3, suggests that the diffusing hydrogen atoms change the property of the passive TiO2 film, making the transport of hydrogen through this barrier layer feasible [75]. Because of the high affinity of hydrogen to titanium, the diffused hydrogen atoms would react with Ti to form γ-TiH and δ-TiH2 in the Ti4211 alloy. Since the PBR of Ti hydrides are larger than 1, the Ti hydrides formation would lead to volume expansion [6,15,77]. As the process of hydrogen charging progressed, more hydrides formed in the alloy. When the expansion stress caused by hydride formation was larger than the strength of the hydrides, the brittle hydride would be cracked, leading to the initiation of the HIC [24,54]."
10,Effect of hydrogen on the electrochemical corrosion behavior of the Ti4211 alloy,"4.2 Effect of hydrogen on the electrochemical corrosion behavior of the Ti4211 alloy As mentioned above, the susceptibility of Ti4211 alloy to the HIC increased as the increase of the hydrogen charging time. How the hydrogen permeation influenced the electrochemical corrosion behavior was another interesting subject in our study, which is of significant importance for the application of this newly-fabricated Ti alloy in marine environments, especially when cathodic protection is provided. In the process of hydrogen charging, the hydrogen generated could diffuse through the passive TiO2 film before reacting with titanium in the matrix. With the penetration of hydrogen through the passive film, the redox transformation of the passive film (Ti (IV) →Ti (III)) coupling with proton reduction to produce the absorbed hydrogen occurred simultaneously [79], which had two possible influences on the passive film. One possibility was the conversion of the passive film to TiOOH, which can be expressed as follows: (3) Ti O 2 + H abs → TiOOH The introduction of hydrogen into the film increased the degree of OH bonding, leading to the decrease in polarizability of O2− ions and thus a decrease in the refractive index. The absorbed H in the passive TiO2 film acted as an electron donor, which could decrease the film resistivity and film extinction coefficient [62]. Another possibility was the repassivation of titanium to form TiO2, which can be expressed as follows [80]: (4) Ti+ 2 H 2 O → Ti O 2 +4 H + +4e The electrochemical studies in Figs. 6 and 7 , Tables 2 and 3 showed that the charged Ti4211 alloy had a higher i p but a lower R p compared to the uncharged Ti4211 alloy, suggesting that the hydrogen charging prompted the redox transformation process of the passive TiO2 film (reaction (3)) and thus led to the decrease of film resistivity. When the hydrogen charging was short (i.e., 1 h) or the redox transformation process was limited, the changes in i p and R p were minor, suggesting that film repassvition process (reaction (4)) could almost compensate the destruction of the passive film caused by hydrogen charging (reaction (3)). When the hydrogen charging time increased to 24 h, at least one order magnitude changes in both i p and R p suggested that the film destructed by hydrogen charging could only partially repaired by film repassvition process, reaction (4). This change in the composition and property of the passive film [15,28] by hydrogen charging led to the shrinking of the passive region and the occurrence of film breakdown or pit initiation. More works about the deterioration effect of hydrogen on the structure and the composition of the passive film of the Ti4211 alloy are needed, and they are under investigation."
11,Conclusions,"Through investigating the microstructural evolution and corrosion behavior of a Ti-4Al-2V-1Mo-1Fe titanium alloy after cathodic hydrogen charging, the main conclusions can be drawn: (1) Hydrogen charging induced the formation of γ-TiH and δ-TiH2 at the α phase and along the α/β boundaries in the Ti4211 alloy. The hydride formation produced expansion stress, leading to the cracking of these brittle hydrides and thus the initiation of the HIC. The amounts of hydrides and HICs were proportional to the hydrogen charging time, suggesting a higher HIC susceptibility of the Ti4211 alloy at a longer charging time. (2) The hydrogen produced by cathodic charging led to the redox transformation of the passive TiO2 film, and thus resulted in the deterioration of corrosion resistance of the Ti4211 alloy in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution."
