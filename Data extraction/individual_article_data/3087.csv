0,Introduction,"Energy demands in the framework of a sustainable environment can be fulfilled by utilizing sunlight that can be harvested, converted, and stored efficiently [1–6]. To fully meet the increasing need of human beings for energy as a measure to reduce the environmental pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion, PEC water splitting seems to be an effective and successful strategy that can convert solar energy to green chemical fuels by transporting four electrons[7–14]. Significant ideas have been devised to successfully compose a photo-anode that is highly efficient as well as allows economical production of chemical energy through solar power. Metal oxide semiconductors like Fe2O3, BiVO4, and WO3, etc. have a narrow bandgap. Hence, they act as good photo-anode materials and these materials have been thoroughly studied because of their non-toxic nature, high abundance, low-cost synthetic methods, and stability [15,16]. TiO2 has been known for significant uses because of its non-toxicity, appropriate photo corrosion-resistance, and favorable band position [17]. In the electrochemical and photo-electrochemical activity, Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is recognized as a basic step for proficient water splitting [18–22]. The major issue faced while using TiO2 as photo-anode during process of PEC water splitting is larger bandgap which effects the absorbance of light [17]. Also, it shows poor water oxidation kinetics in the oxygen evolution reaction [23]. Therefore, to efficiently get the desired results of the solar-to-hydrogen conversion we need proficient OER catalytic agents to increase the number of active sites which can further help in improving the kinetics of OER [24]. After the marvelous investigation conducted by Fujishima and Honda on TiO2 in 1972, various semiconducting sulfide and oxide materials like ZnS, ZnO, WO3, and Fe2O3 are investigated for the highly effective PEC water splitting process [25–29]. Among these semiconducting materials, ZnS is considered an efficient semi-conductor because of its effective thermal and chemical stability [30]. Particularly, it is investigated from the previously mentioned studies that generation of proficient current and efficient conversion can be successfully achieved from ZnS by following the mentioned aspects (i) formation of the composite with particular transition metals, (ii) choosing an efficient aqueous electrolyte for the PEC activity [31]. Among all the available transition metals, graphene has been approved as a proficient composite material due to its high adsorption capacity and various electronic states to increase the PEC activity [32–34] Tables 1 and 2 . It is important to take into account that in a PEC cell the electron flow between cathode and anode is charged by the electrolyte in use. Anions and cations mobility in the electrolyte solution has an important role in attaining proficient PEC activity. Usually, it is observed that high ionic conductivity, good electrochemical strength, and friendly atmospheric nature are key aspects of a perfect electrolyte [31]. To boost up the PEC efficiency fine adjustment of electrolyte parameters is considered to be a good strategy as anions and cations on the surface affect the proton transfer process and water-splitting reaction, respectively [35]. In this study, the effects of graphene-based ZnS composites on PEC activity are explored. A systematic investigation is conducted on the electrons and holes separation, charge conduction, and production of hydrogen under illumination. ZnS composite with different weight ratios (2%, 4%, and 6% of graphene was prepared through the hydrothermal process. It was observed that the addition of graphene in ZnS highly improves the photo-electrochemical activity for H2 production. We believe that by repressing the charge recombination on the photo-anode surface, graphene has greatly enhanced the photo-electrochemical activity. Additionally, increased absorbance sites confirm the light trapping effect of graphene."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of ZnS,"2.1 Synthesis of ZnS Red flakes of sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O) and zinc sulfate powder (ZnSO4·H2O) were used as precursors to synthesis ZnS. These precursors were mixed separately in deionized water (DI water) at 550 rpm with help of magnetic stirrer for 20 min. Afterward, the sodium sulfide mixture was added to zinc sulfate mixture by using a dropper under continuous stirring at 500 rpm. The mixture was poured into Teflon-lined steel autoclave, filled up to 50% of its volume, and tightened properly. The autoclave was placed in the oven for 11 h at 230 °C temperature. The product obtained was washed eight times by using centrifuge at 2500 rpm and 15 min for each wash. The chemical reaction that took place can be described by using equations [36] (1) ZnS O 4 ⇋ Z n 2 + + S O 4 2 (2) Z n 2 + + N a 2 S ⇋ Z n S + N a 2 + The product was later dried at 70 °C for 10 h to get white powder of ZnS. Synthesis of ZnS/Graphene Composite Graphene (thickness = 4–7 nm) with 99.5% purity was obtained from Ailan (Shanghai) Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. China. 1 g of prepared ZnS was mixed in 20 ml of methanol while 2% weight of Graphene with respect to ZnS was mixed in 30 ml of methanol. Individual and collective mixing of each of the materials in methanol was carried out for 15 min at 550 rpm and 30 min at 600 rpm, respectively. Afterward, the solution was promptly placed in the oven at 120 °C for 3 h, tightly enclosed in Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave followed by 45 min long sonication in bath sonicator to ensure suspension homogeneity. Subsequently, the final product was centrifuged at 3500 rpm and later on dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Composites with 4% and 6% weight of graphene were prepared using the same protocol."
3,Anode fabrication,2.2 Anode fabrication About 30 mg of each prepared sample was added in 4 ml of methanol to make paste while polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was added as a binder by 2% weight ratio of prepared material. Four layered spin coating of each sample was performed on FTO glass slide in two steps with ramp 1000. The first step was carried out at a speed of 1000 rpm for 30 s and step two was executed at 2000 rpm for 10 s. Almost 10 mg mass loading of each sample was pasted on each FTO glass slide.
4,Photo-electrochemical water splitting,"2.3 Photo-electrochemical water splitting The photocatalytic activity was performed by using 0.1 M KCL electrolyte and pH was maintained 13. The substrate was attached with the help of copper wire to Bipotentostat electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments Model 760E) and used as working electrode against Ag/AgCl (reference electrode) and platinum wire (counter electrode). Electrolyte with electrodes inside was placed in the Rayonet photochemical reactor (RMR 600). Total 8 lamps of 6 in. arch length were employed in the reactor. Curves against photocurrent density and voltage (i-v) under the potential range of 0–0.72 V [vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] were measured at 50 mVs−1 scanning rate. Transient current density (i-t) curves for the period of 600 s under chopped illumination were observed at 0.72 V. To collect the produced gas, a gas syringe was attached to the system. Gas chromatography with thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD) was performed by using Shimadzu GC-2014, to acquire the actual yield of hydrogen generated during the photo-electrochemical process. Incident photon current efficiency (IPCE) based on wavelength was estimated by using the equation [37]. (3) I P C E % = [ 1024 × i ph / λ × p in Where iph, λ, and pin denote the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), wavelength (nm) of the incident radiation, and the intensity of the experienced light, respectively. Nernst equation was used to convert the potential measured against Ag/AgCl electrode to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) [38]. (4) V RHE = V Ag AgCl + 0.059 p H + 0.1976"
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization To extrapolate the crystal structure of the composites, XRD (X-ray diffraction) curves were obtained with the help of Bruker Advanced D8 (0.1/step size, 0.02 step size, Cu, k, ⍺). Transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM Thermo Fisher Scientific Titan3 Themis G2 300) was employed for morphological and microstructural analysis of the composites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD) was used to obtain elemental composition and chemical bonding of prepared samples. To conduct the Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) experiments ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (PG-instruments T92 + ) was used."
6,Results and discussions,
7,X-Ray diffraction (XRD),"3.1 X-Ray diffraction (XRD) XRD patterns in Fig. 1 show that all composites show the same XRD trend as pure ZnS. In correspondence to diffraction planes (111), (220) and (311) diffraction peaks at 28.7°, 47.68° and 56.5° were observed on 2Θ. Peaks exhibit the zinc blend structure of ZnS. As a result of a lower amount of graphene and less diffraction intensity, the diffraction peak of graphene was covered by strong diffraction peaks of ZnS in ZnS/graphene photo-catalyst [39,40]. A little decrease in XRD peak intensity of ZnS/Graphene composites was observed as bonding of graphene with ZnS caused surface defects and affected crystallinity of ZnS due to stress. Wulff-Bragg equation was used to find the distance between successive lattice planes [41] (5) 2 d hkl sin θ = n λ Where dhkl and λ denote the distance between successive lattice plane and wavelength of X-Rays respectively. 3.12 Å 1.91 Å and 1.62 Å distances were observed in correspond to diffraction planes (111), (210), and (311) respectively. Debye-Scherrer relation was used to obtain information regarding crystalline size [42]. (6) L = 0.9 λ / β c o s θ Where β represents full width at half maximum (FWHM) diffraction peaks. 14.6 nm was the estimated average crystalline size."
8,Transmission electron microscopy (TEM),"3.2 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Fig. 1 (A, B) shows TEM images of pure ZnS, and Fig. 2 (C, D) shows its composite with 6 wt% graphene. According to images, graphene was found with the loading of some ZnS particles. Individual ZnS nanocrystals lattice fringe details are indicated by HR-TEM (high-resolution transmission electron microscopy) Fig. 2(D). The interplanar spacing of 0.31 nm was observed in parallel to (111) ZnS lattice plane. The elemental mapping is shown in image Fig. 3 (A-D) where the distribution of Zinc, Sulfur, and graphene is indicated by dots of Zn, S, and C. Between graphene and ZnS good interfacial contact was divulged with help of TEM images. Transference of photo-induced charge from ZnS to graphene can enhance with the formation of ZnS/graphene interface because of the greater carrier flexibility on the surface of graphene. Photocatalytic activity of the composite can be boosted by the successful photo-generated charge. Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed the formation of ZnS and graphene composite as shown in Fig. 4 ."
9,X-Rays photo spectroscopy (XPS),"3.3 X-Rays photo spectroscopy (XPS) The chemical state of the ZnS/Graphene composite was studied by utilizing XPS. The XPS data was obtained prior to deposition of prepared samples on FTO. General spectra of pure ZnS XPS is shown in Error! Reference source not found. (A). Binding energy at 1022.1 and 1045.2 eV are found in corresponding to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 peaks of Zn 2p. These binding energy values are aligned with the previous findings in the literature [43]. The values obtained from the Zn 2p spectrum correlate with oxidation state Zn2+ which is quite predictable for the ZnS compound. Approximately 23 eV, the estimated spin–orbit splitting among two core components Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 confirms the bivalent state of Zn.[44] The S 2p core peak deconvolution depicts positioning of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peaks at 161.4 eV and 162.6 eV respectively, which shows favorable alignment with Zn-S bond energy [45]. It is clear from Error! Reference source not found. (B) that the signal peaks spotted from ZnS/Graphene composite were C 1 s, Zn 2p, S 2p and O1s. The majority of carbon atoms were noticed in the form of sp2 bonds. XPS peak of C 1 s produced a sum of three Gaussian peaks ranging from 280 to 295 eV. Peaks ascribed to C-OH, CC, and CC were positioned at 289.3, 285.5, and 284 eV, respectively. After deconvoluting O1s spectra of ZnS/6% graphene Gaussian peaks against O-CO and CO were obtained at binding energies 531.19 and 532.26 while Gaussian peaks of C = OH and COC were observed at binding energies 533.01 and 533.80 respectively. The peaks in agreement with Zn 2p1/2, Zn 2p3/2, S 2p3/2, and S2p1/2 of ZnS/Graphene composite exhibited the same behavior as peaks of pure ZnS Fig. 5 . (F-G)."
10,UV–Vis spectroscopy,"3.4 UV–Vis spectroscopy The samples were prepared for UV–Vis spectroscopy by depositing paste of each sample on glass slides. The presence of graphene uplifted the absorption of light and lowered the reflection as graphene. As reported by the energy band theory, the composite effect results in decrement in bandgap due to division of all the levels into n levels corresponding to the number of bonding atoms so the bands fall closer to each other or may even overlap in the case of nano-composite. Fig. 6 (A) shows Uv–vis spectra of pure ZnS and its composites with graphene. ZnS shows a maximum absorption range of 300–340 nm while it's composite with 6% graphene increases that range up to 420 nm. Addition of graphene more than 6% in ZnS/graphene composite decrease the absorption of incident light as black graphene layers cover the Fluorine doped tin oxide glass slide. As reported in earlier published data the addition of graphene more than specific amount effects the absorption of light and decrease the performance water splitting reaction [46]. Kubelka monk plot was used to calculate the band gap as shown in Fig. 6 (B). According to estimated values, the bandgap of ZnS decreased from 3.67 eV to 3.02 eV by 6% addition of graphene."
11,Photo-Electrochemical activity,"3.5 Photo-Electrochemical activity Photocurrent response was observed to investigate the photo-electrochemical (PEC) behaviors of the prepared photo-anodes. Current density of ZnS photo-anode was noticed 0.06 mA/cm2 at 0.72 V (vs RHE) under dark conditions. When the experiment was performed under illumination the photocurrent density approached 0.7 mA/cm2 for ZnS photo-anode at 0.72 V (RHE). Moreover, a remarkable increase in photocurrent response was observed by the addition of different weight ratios of graphene. Composite of ZnS with 2%, 4% and 6% weight ratios of graphene showed 1.37, 1.85 and 2.23(mA cm−2) respectively, at 0.72 V (vs RHE). This notable increase in photocurrent density is ascribed to effectual charge separation and magnified light absorption. The attraction of film towards water substantially influences the photo-electrochemical reaction phenomenon as the photo-electrocatalytic reaction occurs at the electrode/electrolyte interface. IPCE values of fabricated photo-anodes were obtained to acquire the photo-electrochemical response. As shown in Fig. 7 (C) “ZnS shows 5% incident photon to current conversion efficiency at 0.72 V vs RHE in correspond to wavelength 300 nm whereas, it's composite with 6% graphene show 21% IPCE (%) value at 0.72 V vs RHE which is 2.8 folds more than that of ZnS under same wavelength” . The wavelength range covered by IPCE(%) results is similar to the Uv–vis spectral range of photo-catalysts which indicates that ZnS composite with 6% graphene absorbs more photon as compared to pure ZnS. (i-t) curves under chopped illumination were obtained at 0.72 V vs RHE for 600 s as graphed in Fig. 7 (B) which shows the behavior of photo-current density when the light is turned on/off. Higher mobility is key factor of electrolyte used in the cell to increase conductivity. To avoid the corrosion problems potassium hydroxide (KOH) is preferred over acidic electrolytes. According to the earlier reported data, amount of hydrogen produced during water splitting process can be increased by increasing the concentration of KOH the current passing through as it enhance the electric current which is passing through the electrolyte[47,48]. SEM images before and after PEC testing of fabricated photo-anode were compared to find out the change in morphology and structure. The given SEM images in Fig. 8 does not show a notable change in morphology and structure which justifies the stability of material for a long term PEC test Figs. 9 and 10 ."
12,Photo-electrochemical hydrogen production,"3.6 Photo-electrochemical hydrogen production Following the early reported data by [49,50] area under the curve obtained by GC-TCD was converted to micromoles per min by per 10 mg loading of each sample by using the proportionality method. Hydrogen yield produced by pure ZnS photo-anode was 0.013 μmoles cm−2 min−1. Composite of graphene with 2, 4, and 6% weight ratio of Graphene produced 0.019, 0.022, and 0.049 μmoles cm−2 min−1 of hydrogen. These results indicate that hydrogen production rate was increased by 3.7 folds by 6% addition of Graphene in pure ZnS"
13,PEC mechanism,"3.7 PEC mechanism The principal role was played by nano-structured ZnS/Graphene composite in boosted photo-electrocatalytic activity because of defect sites at interface of ZnS/Graphene, a great surface to volume ratio, and the interconnection between ZnS and Graphene,. On account of thermos consideration, migration photo-generated charges occur from one semi-conductor to the valance band of the other during the mechanism of charge separation [56,57]. Under the exposure of irradiations, electron-hole sets are generated. Photo-generated negatively charged electrons drift from the valance band to conduction band of ZnS. Electron-hole sets have got intensive attractive forces to make them recombine at the anode surface. To overcome this limitation electron from graphene migrates to the conduction band of ZnS and enhance the effective charge separation. Thereafter, electrons are transferred to FTO and move along the wire to counter electrode and involve in reduction reaction through hydrogen ion to produce hydrogen, while remaining holes move from valance band of ZnS to graphene and reacts with water through electrode/electrolyte interface and produce oxygen."
14,Conclusions,"ZnS composites were prepared with 2%, 4%, and 6% weight ratios of graphene by using hydrothermal synthesis technique and used as photo-anode for photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Effective charge separation was observed during PEC reaction and maximum current was obtained up to 2.23 mA cm−2. It is also observed that amount of hydrogen evolution increases by increasing the amount of graphene in ZnS/Graphene. The actual yield of hydrogen produced from ZnS composite with 6 wt% graphene (o.o41 μmole cm−1 min−1) was 3.7 folds more than produced by pure ZnS. These results show that the addition of graphene not only increases Uv–vis spectral range of pure ZnS but also increases the amount of Hydrogen produced during PEC process."
