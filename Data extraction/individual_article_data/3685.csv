0,Introduction,"The challenges caused by global warming and fossil fuel depletion have inspired researchers to develop sustainable and renewable energy resources [1,2]. Biomass is one promising renewable energy sources since it is carbon neutral and abundant [3,4]. Liquefaction (or solvolysis) is the thermal decomposition of biomass to bio-crude, gas and solid residue at mild temperatures (250–400 °C) and high pressures (5–20 MPa)in a solvent [5,6]. However, bio-crude generated from direct liquefaction is typically of low quality due to the high content of oxygenated compounds [6,7]. Therefore, bio-crude requires upgrading before it can be used as a transportation fuel [8,9]. Many catalysts have been used to improve the quality and yield of bio-crude produced in biomass liquefaction processes. Homogeneous catalysts such as alkali catalysts (Na2CO3, K2CO3, KOH, NaOH and Ca(OH)2) and acid catalysts (sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid) were used for biomass liquefaction [10,11]. However, these homogeneous catalysts caused serious corrosion effects on liquefaction equipment and were difficult to recycle [12,13]. Therefore, environmentally friendly and readily recyclable heterogeneous catalysts are required to fulfill the feasibility of biomass liquefaction [14]. Zeolite catalysts such as HZSM-5 are effective heterogeneous catalysts that could remove oxygen from oxygenated compounds [15]. However, the strong acidity of HZSM-5 resulted in significant coke deposition and thus decreased the activity of this catalyst [16]. Non-noble transition metals are attracting great attention because of the low cost and high activity for bio-oil upgrading. Cobalt shows higher activity for hydrodeoxygenation reactions in upgrading of bio-oil model compounds such as guaiacol, phenol and 2-ethylphenol [17,18]. Zinc is also a cost effective transition metal that exhibits excellent stability and catalytic activity for upgrading oxygenated compounds to hydrocarbons, and zinc effectively improved the activity of HZSM-5 in bio-oil upgrading reactions including decarbonylation, decarboxylation and dehydrogenation [19]. The catalytic performance of HZSM-5 can be improved by incorporating monometallic transition metals such as cobalt and zinc to increase the yield of bio-oil and reduce coke formation over Co/HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts [19,20]. However, bimetallic HZSM-5 catalysts such as Co-Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-Cu/HZSM-5 showed higher bio-oil upgrading performance than the monometallic HZSM-5 catalysts [21,22]. However, the high hydrogen consumption increased due to the high hydrogen pressure required (7.5–30 MPa) [23]. The hydrogen could be generated relatively greener from water through the zinc metal hydrolysis method, which can be expressed as: Zn + H2O→ZnO + H2 [24]. This method for hydrogen production could replace conventional hydrogen produced from fossil fuel that leads to massive carbon dioxide emission in bio-crude upgrading [23]. However, the cost of hydrogen production from zinc metal hydrolysis method is higher than the conventional hydrogen generation method [23]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reported studies of combining a bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst with a zinc hydrolysis reaction for biomass liquefaction. Co, Zn, and Co/Zn modified HZSM-5 catalysts are used to improve the quality (such as HHV and chemical compositions) of bio-crude through the hydrodeoxygenation, decarbonylation, decarboxylation and dehydrogenation reactions. The catalytic effects of Co/HZSM-5, Zn/HZSM-5 and Co-Zn/HZSM-5 on pine sawdust liquefaction reactions in H2 atmospheres were studied. The elemental compositions, higher heating values and chemical compositions of bio-crudes produced using Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts were determined."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials preparation,"2.1 Materials preparation Pine sawdust (PSD) was provided by Rushmore Forest Products Inc (Rapid City, South Dakota). PSD was then ground into a powder (particle size < 1 mm) using a hammer mill (Thomas-Wiley). Properties of pine sawdust are shown in Table 1 . Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (98.00 wt%) and zinc nitrate hexahydrate (99.99 wt%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Inc. HZSM-5 (Si/Al molar ratio = 30) was purchased from Zeolite International Inc. Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts with different Co or Zn mass loading ratios (20 wt% Co/HZSM-5, 10 wt% Co-10 wt% Zn/HZSM-5 and 20 wt% Zn/HZSM-5) were prepared by a wet impregnation method. The Co or Zn loading ratios on HZSM-5 zeolite were determined according to our preliminary tests and referred to other studies [25,26]. The metal loading ratio (20 wt% or 10 wt%) was calculated by the ratio of the mass of loaded metal (Co or Zn) to the mass of HZSM-5 support. Loading of Co or Zn metals on the HZSM-5 support was conducted by impregnating HZSM-5 in aqueous zinc nitrate hexahydrate or cobalt nitrate hexahydrate solutions at 20 °C for 3 h. The catalysts were dried in air at 120 °C for10 h. The prepared catalysts were calcined in air at 550 °C for 4 h. The 20 wt%Co/HZSM-5, 10 wt%Co-10 wt%%Zn/HZSM-5 and 20 wt%Zn/HZSM-5 were represented as Co/HZSM-5, Co-Zn/HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5, respectively."
3,Liquefaction method,"2.2 Liquefaction method PSD liquefaction tests were conducted in an autoclave reactor (Parr 4575, 500 mL) equipped with a stirrer and an electric heater. Pine sawdust (20.0 g), catalyst (either 4.0 g or no catalyst), ethanol (80.0 g), water (30.0 g) and zinc (4.0 g) were loaded into the reactor. Water-ethanol solvent is more efficient in biomass liquefaction reactions than either water or pure ethanol [27]. Ethanol to water ratio (80.0 g ethanol and 30.0 g water) of this study was determined according to the liquefaction of woody biomass conducted by Cheng et al. [28], since the the addition of water as a co-solvent into ethanol enhanced the liquefaction of biomass and improved bio-crude yield [28]. The reactor was purged six times with 0.07 MPa N2 to remove the air. Subsequently, the initial pressure within the reactor was set at 0.07 MPa with N2. The reactor was heated to the reaction temperature of 300 °C at a heating rate of 5.0 °C min−1. The final reaction temperature maintained for 1 h at a stirring speed of 1000 rpm. The reactor was quickly cooled down to 20 °C by an electric fan 0.5 h later. Since the reaction temperature and pressure of this study (300 °C and 11.73–13.63 MPa) are higher than critical points of ethanol–water mixture (280 °C and 10.60 MPa) [29], the reaction mixture that contains ethanol and water solvent in this study was in the status of supercritical fluid. Supercritical fluids have unique characteristics such as high reactant solubility, high density (liquid-like) for facilitating fast intrinsic reactions and low viscosity (vapor-like) for reducing mass transfer limitations [30,31]. The hydrogen gas that generated form zinc and water reaction involved the bio-crude upgrading reactions such as hydrodeoxygenation and hydrogenation in supercritical solvent according to the previous studies [23,32]. The main purpose of in situ hydrogen production is to use the cheap and available water to generate in situ hydrogen for bio-crude upgrading instead of using external hydrogen supply. This removes the step of connecting the external hydrogen cylinder to the reactor to provide hydrogen for bio-crude upgrading, although it makes the biomass liquefaction reactions a bit more complicate. The adding of zinc metal will react with water to produce hydrogen for bio-crude upgrading reactions and the determination of solid residue yield needs to subtract the yield of generated ZnO from zinc hydrolysis reaction in solid residue product. This makes the liquefaction process and solid residue yield determination a bit more complicated compared to liquefaction without zinc hydrolysis. The tests without adding zinc and with high initial external hydrogen pressure are important. However, this study mainly focused on the catalytic effects of different Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts on the yield and quality of bio-crude using in situ hydrogen generated from zinc hydrolysis reaction. The biomass liquefaction tests without adding zinc and with high initial external hydrogen pressure will be considered in the future studies. The gas product was collected in gas sample bags and then weighed. The solid–liquid suspension remaining in the reactor was poured out and filtered with a pre-weighed filter paper at a reduced pressure, and the solid residue remaining on the filter paper was dried at 105 °C for 24 h and weighed [33]. The dried solid residue contained unreacted pine sawdust, ash, coke, zinc oxide and used catalyst, and it is denoted as raw solid residue. The residual ethanol–water mixture was separated from the liquid filtrate via rotary evaporation at 90 °C at a reduced pressure [3,33]. The residual bio-crude liquid collected from the rotary evaporator was subsequently weighed. The reduced pressure used in the rotary evaporation was 0.01 MPa. Some light bio-crude products including acetone, methanol, acetic acid and BETX (benzene,toluene,ethylbenzeneandxylene) evaporated during ethanol and water solvents removal process. However, the loss of these light compounds in rotary evaporation is in small traces [3,33], and thus it will have little affect the chemical compositions of bio-crude product determined by GC–MS in Table 4. Similar vacuum evaporation at 90 °C for recovering bio-crude product and determining bio-crude chemical compositions by GC–MS was conducted by Brand and Huang et al. [3,33]. The mass of solid biomass residue was determined by subtracting the mass of the used catalyst and zinc oxide from the mass of raw biomass solid residue (as shown in Eq. (1)). The amount and composition of gas product such as H2 produced from the biomass liquefaction in ethanol and from Zn and water hydrolysis cannot be distinguished. Therefore, the gas yield was determined on the mass balance (as shown in Eq. (3)). The yield of products (Y product) including solid residue and bio-crude were determined based on Eq. (2). (1) M solid residue = M raw solid residue - M used catalyst - M zinc oxide (2) Y product = M product / M pine sawdust × 100 % (3) Y gas = ( 1 - M bio - crude - M solid residue ) × 100 % where M product was the mass of solid residue and bio-crude, respectively. The mass of pine sawdust (M pine sawdust) was determined on a dry and ash-free basis. Similar yield and mass balance determination in the liquefaction studies using ethanol solvent were conducted by Huang and Xu et al. [33,34]. Each test was performed in triplicate. The average values and standard deviations of the three observations were reported."
4,Feedstock and products characterizations,"2.3 Feedstock and products characterizations The moisture content of PSD was determined following the ASABE standard (ASAES358.2 DEC1988 (R2008)) [22]. The ash content of PSD was analyzed by heating biomass samples to 575 °C until the weight remained unchanged according to a NREL standard [35]. Elemental compositions of bio-crude and PSD were analyzed using a CE-440 elemental analyzer [36]. Higher heating values (HHV) of bio-crude, PSD and solid residue were analyzed using an IEA C2000 bomb calorimeter [37,38]. The ash content, moisture content, elemental compositions and HHV properties of PSD are shown in . Gas chromatography (Agilent GC-7890A, DB-5 column: 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and mass spectrometry (MSD-5975C, ionization: 70 eV, mass range: 50–500 m z−1) were employed to analyze the chemical compositions of the bio-crude products. The injection temperature and injection volume were 300 °C and 1 μL, respectively. The temperature of the oven was initially set at 60 °C and subsequently increased at various stages, including stage 1 at 3 °C min−1 to 140 °C, stage 2 at 10 °C min−1 to 180 °C, stage 3 at 3 °C min−1 to 260 °C, and stage 4 at 10 °C min−1 to 300 °C. The main chemical compositions in the bio-crude samples were determined according to the NIST mass spectral library and related literature [39,40]. The relative chemical compositions in the bio-crude was calculated by the ratio of its peak area to the total peak area of GC–MS spectra [22]. A gas chromatography system (Agilent GC 7890A, 19095P-S25 column: 50 m × 0.53 mm × 15 μm) was employed to determine the gas compositions [41]. C1–C3 hydrocarbons were determined by a flame ionization detector [42]. Meanwhile, H2, CO and CO2 were determined by a thermal conductivity detector [19]. Argon was used as the carrier gas for the GC system, and calibration was conducted using standard gas mixtures [43]."
5,Catalyst characterizations,"2.4 Catalyst characterizations BET properties of prepared catalysts were analyzed using an automatic micromeritics apparatus (ASAP 2020). The catalyst sample was degassed at 200 °C prior to the test. The BET surface area was determined by the BET equation. Total pore volume was determined by the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at a P/P0 ratio of 0.99. The pore size of catalysts was determined by density functional theory (DFT) using the built-in software in the automatic micromeritics instrument [44,45]. XRD measurements of the prepared catalysts were performed using an X-ray diffractometer (MiniFlex, Rigaku Corporation). X-ray tube was operated at 30 kV and 15 mA. The X-ray pattern was scanned from 5° to 90° by filtered Cu-Kα radiation. The scan speed and step size were set as 2° min−1 and 0.02° (2 theta), respectively. The acidity of the prepared catalysts was determined using a chemisorption analyzer (Micrometrics Autochem II). The catalyst sample was firstly immersed in ammonium hydroxide and was then kept at 20 °C for 3 h. This mixture was subsequently dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The helium flow rate in the chemisorption analyzer was 60 mL min−1. The catalyst sample was kept at 100 °C for 0.5 h to remove physically absorbed ammonia. Subsequently, the sample temperature was increased from 100 °C to 650 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The final temperature of 650 °C was maintained for 0.5 h. During the heating period between 100 °C and 650 °C, enough dilute HCl solution (1.0 mol L−1) was employed to collect the chemisorbed ammonia from the catalyst. Subsequently, NaOH solution (0.1 mol L−1) was employed to titrate the HCl solution to determine the acidity of catalyst sample [46]. TEM images of catalysts were recorded using a JEOL JEM-2100 LaB6 transmission electron microscope that was operated at 200 kV. Catalysts were dispersed into isopropyl alcohol prior to the test. The solution was then shaken in an ultrasound for several minutes. The suspension droplets were then loaded and dried on a carbon-coated copper grid."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterizations,"3.1 Catalyst characterizations 3.1.1 BET analysis The BET surface areas, pore size and pore volumes of Co or Zn modified HZSM-5 catalysts are listed in Table 2 . The BET surface areas and pore volumes of Co or Zn modified HZSM-5 catalysts decreased in comparison to HZSM-5. Some of the HZSM-5 zeolite pores were filled with Co3O4 or ZnO particles after the Co or Zn loading [22]. The average pore sizes of Co or Zn modified HZSM-5 catalysts decreased compared to that of the HZSM-5 catalyst. This was due to the deposition of Co or Zn metal oxides in the channels and pores of HZSM-5 [40]. 3.1.2 XRD analysis XRD spectra of Co or Zn modified HZSM-5 catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . Diffraction peaks corresponding to the HZSM-5 support were observed at 7.9°, 8.8°, 23.0°, 23.2°, 23.6°, 23.9° and 24.4° in the XRD spectra of all HZSM-5 supported catalysts [47]. This demonstrated that the structure of the HZSM-5 support maintained after Co or Zn loading. Peaks corresponding to Co3O4 at 36.8°, 55.7°, 59.6° and 65.2° were observed in the spectra of Co modified HZSM-5 catalysts, and this is consistent with JCPDS 80-1541. Similar peaks corresponding to Co3O4 particles were reported by Liu et al. [48]. Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst exhibited ZnO peaks of 31.7°, 34.3°, 36.2° and 62.8°, and these peak positions are consistent with JCPDS 36–1451. Cheng et al. identified these ZnO peaks [49]. However, the Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst did not exhibit any ZnO diffraction peaks. This indicated that the ZnO species werehighly dispersed on the surface of Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst as tiny particles. There are two possible reasons for the highly dispersed ZnO on the bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst than the monometallic Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst. Firstly, the lower Zn metal loading ratio (10 wt%) of bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to the higher dispersion of ZnO on this catalyst. For mono-metallic Zn/HZSM-5, the high metal loading ratio (20 wt%) resulted in the aggregation of ZnO particles, and this leads to the lower dispersion of ZnO on this catalyst. Similar results of well dispersion of ZnO on lower metal loading zeolite was found by Zhao et al. [19]. Secondly, the incorporation of Co might enhance the interaction between Zn and HZSM-5 and improve the Zn dispersion on bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst [50]. 3.1.3 NH3-TPD analysis NH3-TPD spectra of Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . Two desorption peaks at around 100–350 °C and 350–550 °C are detected for HZSM-5, Co/HZSM-5 and Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts, and this indicated the desorption of ammonia from Lewis acid sites (weak acid sites) and Brönsted acid sites (strong acid sites), respectively [46,51]. However, the Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst mainly showed weak Lewis acid sites. The total acidity of Co modified HZSM-5 catalyst (Co/HZSM-5(0.34 mmol NH3/g cat) and Co-Zn/HZSM-5(0.50 mmol NH3/g cat)) decreased in comparison to that of HZSM-5(0.59 mmol NH3/g cat), and this is similar to that reported by Wang and coworkers [52]. However, the total acidity of the Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst improved with an increased Zn loading ratio, and this indicated that the Zn loading supplied additional Lewis acid sites on HZSM-5 [46]. Zn/HZSM-5 has the highest total acidity at 0.78 mmol NH3/g cat. 3.1.4 TEM analysis TEM images of HZSM-5supported catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . There were no obvious dark spots in the TEM image of HZSM-5, because no Co3O4 and/or ZnO particles were loaded over HZSM-5. However, dark spots were detected on the Co/HZSM-5 catalyst, and this was attributed to the presence of Co3O4 particles. Similar dark spots arising from Co3O4 were observed in TEM images by Zhao et al. [53]. Dark spots were found on the image of Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst, which indicated the presence of ZnO particles. Triwahyono et al. observed similar ZnO dark spots on HZSM-5 catalyst [54]. Smaller dark spots were dispersed better in the TEM image of the Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst. These dark spots indicated the higher dispersion of Co3O4 and/or ZnO species on Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst, which is beneficial to improve the catalyst performance."
8,Product yields,"3.2 Product yields Pine sawdust liquefaction products were distributed in bio-crude, gas and solid residue. Fig. 4 shows the yields of bio-crude, solid residue and gas products of different liquefaction treatments.The mass closures with uncertainty for all treatments were shown in Table 3 , and the mass closures were close to 100 wt%. The bio-crude yield of no catalyst treatment was 57.92 wt%. Compared to no catalyst treatment, the HZSM-5 supported catalysts increased bio-crude yields. The bio-crude yield of HZSM-5 treatment was 64.31 wt%, and the bio-crude yield of Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 treatments was 65.02–67.38 wt%. This indicated that zeolite catalysts were effective in enhancing the conversion reactions of biomass in the liquefaction process [55,56]. Co/HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts produced higher bio-crude yields (65.02–67.38 wt%) than HZSM-5 catalyst (64.31 wt%). The loading of Co or Zn on HZSM-5 could improve the activity of HZSM-5 due to the promoted hydrodeoxygenation, esterification, hydrogenation, decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions [51,57]. Compared to monometallic Co/HZSM-5 (65.02 wt%) and Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst (65.63 wt%), bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst further improved the bio-crude yield. The synergistic effect of Co and Zn metal active sites on the HZSM-5 support might improve HDO performance of bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts [58,59]. Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst generated the highest bio-crude yield at 67.38 wt%. The gas yields of catalytic treatments (12.46–16.51 wt%) were higher than gas yield obtained in no catalyst treatment (9.70 wt%). This was attributed to the promotion of gas formation reactions such as cracking, decarbonylation and decarboxylation on zeolite acid sites. The gas yields of Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 treatments (13.12–16.51 wt%) were higher than gas yield of HZSM-5 treatment (12.46 wt%). The yields of solid residues obtained with Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts (16.11–21.86 wt%) were lower than those obtained with the HZSM-5catalyst (23.23 wt%). This indicated that the Co and Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts inhibited coke deposition that led to catalyst deactivation [59], which resulted in a higher pine sawdust conversion ratio to gas and bio-crude products. This led to the less amount of unreacted biomass left in solid residue. Besides, the increased biomass conversion efficiency also resulted in the decreased yield of solid residues for the liquefaction using Co and Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts [60]. This is consisted with the studies of Wang and Saber et al. [55,56]."
9,Elemental compositions and higher heating value of bio-crude and solid residue,"3.3 Elemental compositions and higher heating value of bio-crude and solid residue The elemental compositions and higher heating value (HHV) of bio-crude and solid residue produced in all treatments are shown in Table 3. The oxygen content of bio-crude products (15.29–33.99 wt%) reduced significantly compared to pine sawdust (44.87 wt%), and the contents of carbon (58.42–75.91 wt%) and hydrogen (6.61–8.12 wt%) in bio-crude samples improved in comparison to pine sawdust (47.64 wt% and 6.25 wt%) after the liquefaction reactions. This resulted in the improved HHV (23.12–34.27 MJ kg−1) of bio-crude products in comparison to pine sawdust (19.19 MJ kg−1). The oxygen was mainly removed as CO and CO2 through decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions during the liquefaction process [61]. Compared to bio-crude (28.18–33.99 wt%) generated from HZSM-5 and no catalyst treatments, Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts further decreased the oxygen content of bio-crude products (15.29–17.64 wt%). This was attributed to the promoted decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions of Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts that removed oxygen compounds in bio-crude products [19]. Thus, HHV (33.13–34.27 MJ kg−1) of bio-crude produced by Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts improved compared to non-catalytic and HZSM-5 produced bio-crudes (23.12–27.51 MJ kg−1) due to the lower oxygen content. The carbon content of solid residue in Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 treatments was lower than solid residue of no catalyst treatment. This was due to the high conversion of PSD to bio-crude and gas products in Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 treatments. The carbon balance of the liquefaction treatments was 94.67–97.85 wt%."
10,Chemical compositions of bio-crudes,"3.4 Chemical compositions of bio-crudes The bio-crude products were analyzed by GC/MS to determine their chemical compositions.The categories of identified compounds in bio-crudes generated from different liquefaction treatments are shown in Table 4 . The alcohols reported in Table 4 include benzenemethanol, benzyl alcohol, homovanillyl alcohol, 2-methyl-6-methylene-2-octanol, (4-methoxyphenyl)(2-methylenecyclohexyl) methanol and 6-ethyl-2-methyl-6-hepten-2-ol. The chemical compounds such as phenols were determined by the retention time of the peaks for phenols in the GC–MS specra of bio-crude product according to the NIST mass spectral library (Fig. S1 and Table S1 in supporting information). The chemical components detected in bio-crudes generated from no catalyst treatment mainly include oxygenated compounds such as phenols (10.80%), ketones (15.91%), esters (35.74%), acids (5.57%) and alcohols (8.28%). These compounds resulted in undesirable bio-crude properties such as instability, corrosiveness and low heating values. Only a small proportion of the targeted hydrocarbons (3.04%) were detected in the bio-crude product. The chemical compositions of bio-crudes obtained in the presence of HZSM-5 supported catalysts changed significantly. The ketones contents of bio-crudes generated by HZSM-5 and Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts reduced compared to those obtained without catalyst treatment.The ketones were probably transformed to hydrocarbons through cracking, decarbonylation and aromatization reactions [62]. Similar findings were reported by Iliopoulou and coworkers [63]. Some phenols might have been converted to hydrocarbons via dehydration, hydrogenation, dehydroaromatization and hydrogenolysis reactions on zeolite catalysts [57]. This led to the reduced contents of phenols in bio-crude products produced by HZSM-5 and Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts. This is consistent with the findings of Torri et al. [64]. The alcohols content reduced in bio-crudes produced by HZSM-5 and HZSM-5 supported Co or Zn catalysts. Some of the removed alcohols were converted to hydrocarbons via cracking, dehydration and aromatization reactions [62], while other disappeared alcohols were transformed to esters via esterification reactions [65]. The bio-crudes produced using HZSM-5 based catalysts exhibited lower ester contents compared to bio-crude produced without catalyst treatment.This was attributed to the conversion of esters to hydrocarbons via dehydration, cracking and oligomerization reactions that occurred on HZSM-5 based catalysts [22]. The acid compounds found in bio-crudes generated with HZSM-5 and Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts were lower than that found in bio-crude produced without catalyst treatment. Some of the removed acid compounds were converted to esters through esterification reactions with alcohols, and the other acid compounds were transformed to hydrocarbons through decarboxylationreactions [65]. This reduction of the acidic compounds content is beneficial for reducing the acidic nature of bio-crude, which otherwise requires costly equipment design to withstand bio-crude storage, transportation and processing [66]. HZSM-5 zeolites possess highly acidic Brönsted acid sites and weakly acidic Lewis acid sites [63]. Brönsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites were responsible for decarbonylation, decarboxylation, cracking, hydrodeoxygenation, hydrogenation and hydrocracking reactions that transformed oxygenated compounds to hydrocarbons on HZSM-5 supported catalysts [63]. The hydrocarbons contents in bio-crude samples produced from HZSM-5 and Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts were higher than that in bio-crude generated without catalyst treatment. In comparison to bio-crude produced using HZSM-5 catalyst, Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts produced bio-crude that contained higher hydrocarbons contents. This increase was attributed to the Co or Zn induced hydrodeoxygenation, decarboxylation, decarbonylation and dehydrogenation reactions on Co or Zn modified HZSM-5 catalysts [67]. In comparison to the monometallic Co/HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts (12.57% and 13.18%, respectively), the bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst produced bio-crude with a higher hydrocarbons content (18.59%). This was due to the synergistic effect of Co and Zn metals on the HZSM-5 support that enhanced catalytic activity of Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst [68]."
11,The additive effects of catalyst on PSD liquefaction,"3.5 The additive effects of catalyst on PSD liquefaction Bio-crude deoxygenation and hydrodeoxygenation reactions on catalysts occurred during the biomass liquefaction process using a Co and/or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalyst in a hydrogen atmosphere. The Brönsted and Lewis acid sites in the HZSM-5 zeolite catalyzed bio-crude compounds transforming reactions such as decarboxylation, decarboxylation, aromatization, cracking, dehydrogenation and dehydration [19,51]. These zeolite catalyzed reactions promoted the formation of hydrocarbons from oxygenated compounds including acids, ketones, phenols and alcohols. The loading of Co on HZSM-5 improved hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions used in the bio-crude upgrading process [18,69]. The Co metal improved the direct CO bond scission ability, and this improved hydrodeoxygenation of phenolic compounds [70]. The loading of Zn on the HZSM-5 catalyst promoted dehydrogenation and aromatization reactions [71,72]. The Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst also improved dehydration, hydrogenation and oligomerization reactions in the bio-crude upgrading process [59,73]. This was attributed to the Lewis acid sites on Zn/HZSM-5, which facilitated the deoxygenation reactions [74,75]. Co and Zn are the active centers for the catalytic deoxygenation and hydrogenation reactions taking place on the Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst. The improved catalytic activity of the bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst(synergistic effect of Co and Zn) over that exhibited by the monometallic Co/HZSM-5 or Zn/HZSM-5catalysts was attributed to three primary factors. Firstly, the loading of Zn improved the interactions between Co and HZSM-5 support [50]. Secondly, bimetallic catalysts possessed enhanced stability in comparison with the monometallic catalysts [76]. Finally, the loading of a second metal inhibited excessive carbon formation on the metal active sites of the bimetallic catalysts, and this inhibited coke deposition on bimetallic catalysts in comparison with that encountered with monometallic catalysts [77]. Therefore, the content of hydrocarbons in bio-crude produced by Co-Zn/HZSM-5 treatment was higher than Co/HZSM-5, Zn/HZSM-5 and no catalyst treatment."
12,Gas distributions and reactor pressures,"3.6 Gas distributions and reactor pressures The compositions of the gas product that were determined by GC are shown in Fig. 5 . The gas composition reported in Fig. 5 was compositions of the mixed gas that generated from both biomass liquefaction in ethanol-water solvent and zinc hydrolysis. The hydrogen product was generated via a zinc hydrolysis reaction [24], and the presence of unreacted hydrogen indicated that the generated hydrogen was abundant for bio-crude upgrading reactions. Another main gas component was CO2 that was produced from decarboxylation reactions of oxygenated compounds [61]. Meanwhile, CO was produced by decarbonylation reactions of organic compounds [3,55]. The contents of CO2 and COgenerated from Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts were higher than those produced with HZSM-5 or without catalyst treatments. This suggested that the Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts promoted decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions. CH4 was formed when the methoxyl groups of organic compounds underwent dealkylation reactions [3]. C2-C3 hydrocarbons were produced via the cracking or decomposition of reaction intermediates or alcohols [3]. Reactor pressures obtained in different treatments are shown in Table 5 . Initial pressure is the reactor pressure after purging with N2. Maximum pressure is the reactor pressure after the reactor was heated to 300 °C. Final pressure was the reactor pressure when the HDO reactor was cooled to 20 °C after reaction. The improved catalytic performance provided by HZSM-5 as well as Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts resulted in higher gas yields via cracking, decarbonylation and decarboxylation reactions. This improved the maximum and final pressures of HZSM-5 and Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 treatments compared tono catalyst treatment, although the initial pressure for all treatments was the same."
13,Conclusion,"Catalytic liquefaction of pine sawdust on HZSM-5 and Co or Zn modified HZSM-5 catalysts was conducted in a hydrogen atmosphere generated from zinc hydrolysis. The catalytic effects of different HZSM-5 supported catalysts on the yields and quality of bio-crude and gas were investigated. The oxygen content of bio-crude products (15.29–33.99 wt%) reduced significantly compared to pine sawdust (44.87 wt%), and HHV (23.12–34.27 MJ kg−1) of bio-crude products improved in comparison to pine sawdust (19.19 MJ kg−1). The HZSM-5 supported catalysts improved the yields of bio-crude and gas in comparison to no catalyst treatment. The synergistic effect of Co and Zn on HZSM-5support improved the activity of bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst. This was indicated by enhanced interaction between Co and HZSM-5, higher stability and activity, and lower coke formation of bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst than monometallic Co/HZSM-5 or Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst. The bio-crude yield of HZSM-5 treatment was 64.31 wt%, and the bio-crude yield of Co or Zn loaded HZSM-5 treatments was higher at 65.02–67.38 wt%. Especially, bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst generated the highest bio-crude yield at 67.38 wt%. The catalysts decreased the contents of acids, ketones, phenols and alcohols contents in bio-crude products, while the catalysts increased the hydrocarbons content in bio-crude products. Bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts exhibited higher catalytic performance to improve bio-crude yield and quality compared to monometallic Co/HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts due to the synergistic effect of Co and Zn on HZSM-5 support. The bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst produced bio-crude with a higher hydrocarbons content (18.59%) in comparison to monometallic Co/HZSM-5 (12.57%) and Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst (13.18%)."
