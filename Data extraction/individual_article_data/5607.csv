0,Introduction,"Hydrogen and methane are potential alternative energy carriers with considerable significances (Liu et al., 2013). Hydrogen is a clean fuel having high conversion efficiency without generating pollutants during its combustion (Lay et al., 2019). Methane is used as a transportation fuel because of its higher calorific value and lower CO2 emissions during combustion as compared to oil and coal (Bolzonella et al., 2018). The mixture of hydrogen and methane is hythane and it gains attention due to its advantages as a valuable fuel (Liu et al., 2013). Comparing with methane, hythane has better fuel characteristics of less greenhouse gases emissions (CO, CO2 and NOx) and high heat efficiency (Bolzonella et al., 2018; Hans and Kumar, 2018). Therefore, hythane might be a potential gaseous alternative energy source in the future. Adding hydrogen into methane is the most common hythane production method but it is very important to consider the issue of sustainability. Utilizing anaerobic fermentation to produce biohydrogen and biomethane and mixed them together as biohythane is a prospective and sustainable way (Liu et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2018). Furthermore, a two-stage (H2 production and CH4 production) anaerobic fermentation has advantages of high hydrogen production rate, waste volume reduction and stabilization (Nathoa et al., 2014). Nevertheless, such anaerobic biohythane productions using two separated bioreactors require more processes and cost for storing and mixing hydrogen and methane. For example, it is reported that in Europe quite low percentage (less than 1%) of biogas plants uses a two-stage process due to high capital costs (Roy and Das, 2016). Recently, producing biohythane via a single-stage fermentation has been nominated to minify restrictions on operating two bioreactors in financial, energy and manpower issues (Pasupuleti and Venkata Mohan, 2015). However, using one bioreactor would have inhibition problems of high concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) which is toxic to hydrogen-producers and then resulting in low methane yield (Franke-Whittle et al., 2014). To improve the above-mentioned shortcomings of single-stage and two-stage fermentation systems in hythane production, a novelty two-compartment bioreactor (TCR) was developed. This TCR was a continuously-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) having characteristics of design simplicity. Food waste is a potential source for biofuel production because of wide availability, high carbohydrate content and being renewable (Bolzonella et al., 2018). Hydraulic retention time (HRT) is an important factor affecting substrate uptake efficiency, microbial population and metabolic pathways in biological CSTR systems (Wang et al., 2013). Furthermore, HRT is directly related to capital costs because shorter HRTs allow smaller reactor sizes with higher loading rates (Schmidt et al., 2014). Based on the above observations, this study used a novel TCR bioreactor to investigate the potential of biohythane production via single-stage anaerobic fermentation. A specific aim was to show HRT effects on biohythane productivity and reaction stability in the hydrogenesis and methanogenesis compartments."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feedstock,"2.1 Feedstock Food waste feedstock was collected from a restaurant in Feng-chia night market (Taichung, Taiwan). Plastic bags, waste paper and bones were removed manually and then the food waste was ground for 5 min using a blender and filtered to obtain a final particle size of below 1 mm. The filtered food waste substrate was then mixed with nutrients and stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C before being used as feed for biohythane fermentation. The nutrients of growing methanogens were used (g/L) (Lin et al., 1986): (NH4)2HPO4 0.7, NH4Cl 0.85, MgSO4·7H2O 0.25, MgCl2·6H2O 0.81, FeCl3·6H2O 0.42, NaHCO3 6.72, KCl 0.75, CoCl2·6H2O 0.018. The composition of raw and filtered food waste components and characterization are shown in Table 1 . The contents of the elements of C, H, O and N were 44.5, 6.7, 39.9 and 2.3% (w/w), respectively."
3,Inoculums,"2.2 Inoculums The inoculum for the hydrogenesis compartment was an anaerobic digester sludge generated in a beverage wastewater treatment plant. The collected anaerobic sludge was pre-treated by heating at 95 °C for 1 h to inhibit methanogenic activity. This sludge had pH and total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) concentration values of 5.8 and 12.0 g/L, respectively. In the methanogenesis compartment, the inoculum was anaerobic granular sludge collected from a winery industry and had pH and TCOD concentration values of 7.5 and 60.5 g/L, respectively."
4,Bioreactor,"2.3 Bioreactor The biohythane production reactor had two compartments separated by a portable bulkhead (Fig. 1 ). The upper (MC) and lower (HC) compartments were for methane and hydrogen productions, respectively and both of them were operated in a mode of CSTR. This biohythane reactor was a cylindrical glass-made column having a working volume of 5 L (internal diameter 9 cm, height 80 cm) with HC and MC being 300 mL and 4700 mL, respectively. The reactor was equipped with instrumentation allowing pH and oxidation redox potential (ORP) to be monitored in real time during fermentation experiments. Temperature control was a thermal water jacket. The reactor had a feed inlet, two liquid sampling points and an effluent outlet. The portable bulkhead was a plastic vacuous cylinder of 3 cm height and on the surfaces of both side had 42 holes with a diameter of 0.6 cm to allow the flow of HC effluent into MC. The ratio between hole and bulkhead perimeters was 0.3. Twenty glass marbles with a diameter of 1 cm were filled in this bulkhead to prevent commingling of compartments as well as gravity settling of methanogen granules from MC to HC."
5,Biohythane production experiments,"2.4 Biohythane production experiments Biohythane fermentation was conducted at 35 °C. The pH of 7 was controlled only in MC via automatic control (pH KDP-3000) by adding NaOH (1 N) solution. The TCR was continuously stirred using a motor agitator at 150 rpm. The food waste substrate was continuously fed into the TCR from HC. The operation conditions of the TCR are summarized in Table 2 . For starting-up the TCR system, the HC was filled up with 150 mL hydrogen inoculum and 150 mL food waste mixture; the MC was filled up with 3700 mL anaerobic digested sludge and 1000 mL food waste mixture. Then the TCR was operated anaerobically in a batch mode for 48 h to enrich the biomass of hydrogen- and methane-producing microorganisms. Dark fermentations were conducted to obtain an optimum HRT for giving maximum biohydrogen and biomethane production. The HC was operated at five HRTs of 0.6, 0.42, 0.30, 0.18 and 0.12 d which were equivalent to organic loading rates (OLRs) of 68.33, 98.10, 135.67, 227.22 and 340.83 g COD/L-d, respectively. Since the HC effluent directly up-flew into the MC, the flow rates in the two compartments were same. Moreover, the volume ratio of MC/HC was 47/3, therefore, the MC had HRTs of 9.40, 6.48, 4.70, 2.82 and 1.88 d which were equivalent to OLRs of 4.36, 6.26, 8.66, 14.50 and 21.76 g COD/L/d, respectively. However, the MC feeding characteristics were dependent on the metabolite variations in HC, which enables a clear elucidation of the HRT effects on the TCR’s performance. The experimental loading conditions in the system at various HRTs are summarized in Table 2."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods During the experiments, total gas productions, gas composition, and liquid characteristics were determined. Biogas production was determined using a gas meter (Ritter, Germy) and gas samples were taken daily. Biogas composition (hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide) was determined using a gas chromatography equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (China Chromatograph 8700T). The calculations of hydrogen and methane gas volumes were to multiply the total biogas volume by their proportions. Hydrogen production rate (HPR) and methane production rate (MPR) were expressed as L-H2/L-d and L-CH4/ L-d, respectively. The reactor effluents were sampled every 5 days to measure the concentrations of liquid content. Concentrations of total solids (TS), TCOD and other items were analysed according to procedures of Standard Methods (APHA, 1998). The liquid samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and their supernatants were analysed for lactate, ethanol and volatile fatty acids (VFAs, i.e. acetate, propionate and butyrate) using a gas chromatograph having a flame ionization detector (Shimadzu GC-14, Japan). To determine the lipid, protein and carbohydrate concentrations, reactor liquid were sampled during the steady-state conditions at each HRT; their concentrations were determined using Soxhlet extraction method reported by Manirakiza et al. (2001), colorimetric method of Bradford assay (Bradford, 1976) and Anthrone-sulfuric acid method (Koehler, 1952), respectively. To show the variations of microbial biomass, DNA analysis was conducted for the reactor sludge. Appropriate amounts of sludge were sampled, immediately frozen and stored at −20 °C. The sludge samples were thawed and dispersed and washed twice in phosphate buffer saline before DNA extraction. Total genomic DNA was obtained and purified using the Blood & Tissue Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System (Viogene, Taiwan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA samples were stored at −20 °C prior to PCR reactions."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Gas production at various HRTs,"3.1 Gas production at various HRTs The HC and MC were two independent spaces. In the HC, OLR was increased stepwise to reduce impacts on hydrogen-producing bacteria. In starting-up the reactor, the initial HRT 0.6 d was operated for 33 days. Then HRTs were decreased to 0.42, 0.30, 0.18 and 0.12 d with operation periods of 36, 43, 65 and 35 days, respectively. The daily variations of biogas production in the whole reactor (TCR) during all the tested periods are shown in Fig. 2 and its biogas production data during steady-state conditions are summarized in Table 3 . The biogas production performances in the HC and MC are elucidated as below. 3.1.1 Hydrogen compartment In the HC, at HRTs 0.4 and 0.6 d there was no hydrogen production; at HRTs 0.3–0.12 d, low HRT gave high hydrogen production. Moreover, hydrogen production increased markedly by near 20 times with a small reduction of HRT from 0.3 d to 0.12 d. These facts indicate the characteristics of HRT-dependent hydrogen production. At the beginning of each loading in decreasing the HRT, there was a slight increment in H2 production before the system adapted to new conditions. This resulted from some facts that the microorganisms (1) faced instantaneous stepwise increments of an organic loading, (2) overproduced hydrogen due to exuberant feed, (3) re-adjusted their functions for the new conditions, (4) decelerated their metabolisms and then (5) adapted to new environments resulting from the HRT variations (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017). Particularly, at HRTs 0.6 and 0.42 d, the effluent exhibited similar characteristics with hydrogen production being found as approximately 5% in the first few days and afterwards no hydrogen during reactor's steady-state. The absence of hydrogen could be attributed to granular methanogens settling to the HC and then causing VFAs- or hydrogen-consumptions. Moreover, these VFAs-consumption might cause an alkaline HC environment contributing to growth inhibition of hydrogen microorganisms. At HRTs 0.6 and 0.42 d, in HC the pH values oscillated slightly from 6.8 to 7.0 which were not the optimal condition for hydrogen production. The optimum pH for fermentative hydrogen production has been reported to range from 5.0 to 7.0 (Li and Fang, 2007) though this value is feedstock-dependent with neutral, 6.5–7 and 5–6 for livestock, crop and food wastes, respectively (Guo et al., 2010). In addition, there might have occurrences of a hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis or a low organic loading leading to insufficient feedstock for hydrogen microorganisms. At pH > 6.5, hydrogen in digester gas could be consumed by homoacetogens and methanogens (Roy and Das, 2016). Hydrogen was determined at HRTs ≤ 0.3 d. Before reaching steady-state conditions, hydrogen content increased slightly from 1 to 3%. During steady-state, HPR maintained at 41.1 mL/L-d with 3.38% hydrogen. The fluctuation of hydrogen content might result from (1) complicated microbial communities and microbial population shifts during long reactor operation and (2) the disturbances in the reactor due to various inorganic and organic components in the food waste causing inhibitions (Slezak et al., 2017). When HRT decreased from 0.3 to 0.18 d, the HPR increased markedly from 43 to 260 mL/L-d (Table 3) and hydrogen contents varied from 3.38 to 7.53%. Noted that at HRT 0.18 d, hydrogen content suddenly hiked up to 17% at days 156–159 (Fig. 2) which pH reaching 6.5 from a pH-monitoring failure. pH 6.5 had been shown to have good performances in both hydrogen generation potential and process kinetics (Cappai et al., 2014). After being stable for 20 days from the spike, the HRT was shortened to 0.12 d and the HPR was observed to increase to 714 mL/L-d with peak hydrogen content of 8.6%. Though the operation conditions were different, the present study gave a much higher HPR than some reports of 120 and 370 mL/L-d (Pisutpaisal et al., 2014). To verify 0.12 d being the optimum HRT to have peak hydrogen production, the HRT was further decreased to 0.06 d, which did not result in any significant increase in hydrogen production and hydrogen content comparing to at HRT 0.12 d. The data obtained were different from some reports. Liu et al. (2016) reported that HPR increased from 2.25 to 11.39 L H2/L-d when HRT decreased from 4 to 1 h (0.17 to 0.04 d) using a beverage wastewater substrate. Another report was that thermophilic hydrogen production from a cheese whey powder solution gave a HPR increment from 0.21 to 2.56 mol H2/mol hexose when the HRT was reduced from 8 to 0.5 h (Ottaviano et al., 2017). However, too short HRT would inhibit hydrogen activity (Sivagurunathan et al., 2016). These results indicate that hydrogen production is significantly affected by HRT. At HRT 0.06 d, HPR fluctuations were experienced showing that the reactor performance was instable. This might be due to the microorganisms having no sufficient time to hydrolyse substrates at short HRTs. It is concluded that 0.12 d was the optimal operation HRT to give a peak hydrogen production. 3.1.2 Methane compartment As mentioned earlier, both HC and MC compartments had same flow rates because the MC received the hydrogenesis effluent directly from the HC for methanogenesis. The methane content, production rate and methane yield obtained at steady-state conditions for each HRT in the MC are also summarized in Table 3. Methane content and production have been reported to increase at the beginning of increasing loading rates (Yeshanew et al., 2016). However, the present work shows that in the first-week methane content and production decreased and then rose gradually to achieve a steady-state condition (Fig. 2). This might attribute to facts that (1) the hydrolysis and acidogenesis took place drastically at the beginning of each changed loading in the HC; (2) an accumulation of VFAs contributed to pH drops leading to pH disparities between these two compartments and causing an inhibition to the methane production (Zhang et al., 2014). On the other hand, the methane contents had no obvious fluctuations with values of 48.0–54.8% for these tested HRTs (Fig. 2a). This meets a report on a conventional methane reactor that low HRT (with increasing OLR) imposed a pressure on the shift of microbial community and then leading to a negative influence in methane content (Syutsubo et al., 2013). On the contrary, methane production rate and methane yield increased progressively with a HRT reduction (Fig. 2b). A MPR of 112 mL/L-d was obtained at HRT 2.82 d but longer HRTs of 4.70–9.40 d gave low MPR values of 44–54 mL CH4/L-d. Noted that when the HRT was further decreased to 1.88 d, the methane production increased sharply with a MPR of 0.25 L/L-d and a methane yield of 10.2 mL/g COD. The present work had lower MPR values comparing to some reported values using immobilized cells (Pasupuleti and Venkata Mohan, 2015; Paudel et al., 2017). Paudel et al. (2017) obtained a MPR of 2.04 L CH4/L-d in an anaerobic fixed bed reactor using a food waste substrate. Pasupuleti and Venkata Mohan (2015) also found that HRT 1.5 d gave a maximum MPR 2.64 L CH4/L-d using a semi-pilot scale bioreactor under mesophilic condition. Lower methane in this study comparing to these reports could be explained by the effects of the number of microbes remained in the bioreactor. These researchers used immobilized cells which would give higher methane production from having high bacteria concentrations. Their results agreed with a report that a minimum HRT of 15–30 d is necessary to prevent a wash-out of the methanogenic biomass and to give enough time for effective substrate degradation (Paudel et al., 2017). A confirmation test was conducted to determine an optimal HRT for the MC by decreasing the HRT to 0.94 d (from 1.88 d). This HRT resulted in a methane content of below 30% and unstable TCR performance. During the experiments, in keeping the operation pH the consumed alkaline solution volume was as much as that of the inflow substrate, which means that the sludge biomass was diluted and washed-out. Another reason causing bad reactor performance was that the growth of methanogens might be inhibited and growing some acidogenic microorganisms because of high accumulation of VFAs caused by accreted loading rates at short HRTs (Bouallagui et al., 2003). Since the methanogenesis of the TCR was bad at HRT 0.94 d, therefore, the HRT was increased to 1.88 d again for 2 weeks to observe the recovery of the reactor performance and confirming the optimum operation HRT for obtaining a peak methane production. At this 1.88 d HRT, the MPR and CH4 content were similar to those values obtained in the earlier operation. Therefore, it is concluded that 1.88 d was the optimal HRT for giving peak methane production."
9,Liquid products at various HRTs,"3.2 Liquid products at various HRTs Biogas fermentation always accompanies with generating metabolic liquid intermediates such as VFAs and alcohols. In the present work, the variation of liquid products at the tested HRTs was elucidated. Table 4 shows the variation of VFAs composition and their concentrations of the two compartments collected from ports 1 and 3 at various HRTs during steady-state conditions. 3.2.1 Hydrogen compartment In the HC, acetate and butyrate were the dominant VFAs at all tested HRTs (Fig. 3 a) and had a trend of increasing with the decreased HRT (Table 3). This result indicates that the hydrolytic-acidogenic activity was more significant at low HRTs. At HRTs 0.60 and 0.42 d, no hydrogen was detected during steady-state conditions but propionate concentrations of 140–160 mg COD/L was determined. This could be explained that the fermentation process was governed by several completive metabolic pathways, which might negatively affect hydrogen production. Hydrogen is produced via the metabolic pathways of acetate or butyrate fermentation but no hydrogen production in a propionate fermentation (Eq. (1)). A propionate fermentation pathway was unfair for hydrogen production and causing low hydrogen yield (Chu et al., 2012). Furthermore, the presence of acetate in a fermenter does not necessarily show a high hydrogen productivity because acetate can also be generated by hydrogen-consuming homoacetogens (Eq. (2)). At long HRTs, homoacetogens produce acetate via consuming hydrogen as an electron donor and carbon dioxide as electron acceptor (Paudel et al., 2017). Propionate fermentation (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O Homoacetogenesis (2) 4H 2 + 2 CO 2 → CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O However, propionate concentration gradually decreased from 160 to 80 mg COD/L when the HRT was shortened from 0.42 to 0.12 d; this corresponding to an increase in hydrogen production. Acetate and butyrate showed an opposite variation trend to propionate; their concentrations increased with the decrease of HRT from 0.42 to 0.12 d and correlating to increasing hydrogen production. At HRT 0.12 d, peak hydrogen production was obtained and acetate and butyrate concentrations reached the highest values of 43–46% in total VFAs (Table 4). To elucidate hydrogen production, a concentration ratio of butyrate to acetate (B/A) has been proposed to quantitatively indicate the relationship between hydrogen yield and microbial metabolic pathways (Ghimire et al., 2015). In the present study, the B/A ratio ranged from 0.93 to 1.14 agreeing with reported values of 0.5–5.0 (Noblecourt et al., 2018). According to these results, acetate and butyrate fermentations were the dominant metabolic pathways of biohydrogen production in the HC. 3.2.2 Methane compartment Similar to the organic acids production in the HC, the MC also generated acetate, butyrate, propionate and butanol and all the concentrations of VFAs also increased gradually with a decreasing HRT. At any given HRT, acetate was at the highest concentration followed by butyrate, propionate and butanol. Theoretically, one mole acetate will produce one mole methane (Eq. (3)). In anaerobic environments, acetate is also produced from butyrate and propionate degradations (Eqs. (4) and (5)). Therefore, a discussion on concentration variation of acetate in the MC needs to consider these facts (3) CH3COOH + 2H2O → CH4 + CO2 (4) 2CH3CH2CH2COOH + HCO3 − + H2 → 4CH3COOH + CH4 + H+ (5) 4CH3CH2COOH + 3H2O → 4CH3COOH + 3CH4 + HCO3 − + H+ Fig. 3b depicts the status of metabolic intermediates throughout all the tested HRTs in the MC. Intermediates from the compartment signify that methane was produced from an acetate conversion (Table 3) because of the reduction of acetate concentration. Table 3 shows that approximately 60% of the inputted acetate from the HC was degraded in MC at the optimal HRT. Butyrate was also abundant in HC. More than 40–50% degradation of n-butyrate and i-butyrate during acidogenic and methanogenic stages indicates the slow conversion of butyrate into methylated acids and finally into methane (Table 3). These reduction percentages were calculated by (VFAHC − VFAMC)/VFAHC * 100. Acetate conversion to methane is a one step process (Eq. (3)) and is easier to occur comparing to butyrate conversion (Eq. (4)), which signifies that an acetate degradation is faster than that of butyrate in methanogenesis (Paudel et al., 2017). Fig. 3b also illustrates that propionate degradation rates were very low (Table 3) in all tested HRTs because of the presence of high propionate concentrations. This low propionate degradation rate might result from high organic loading and VFA product inhibition (Luo et al., 2011). The concentration accumulations of VFAs show an ineffective hydrogen production in the HC and they were consumed in the MC. These data were compared to other studies using two-stage anaerobic bioreactors (Paudel et al., 2017; Yeshanew et al., 2016). Paudel et al. (2017) used separated hydrogen reactor and showed 70–80% degradation of lactate and acetate in a methanogenic reactor at HRTs 20 and 15 d. In the present work, the insignificant reduction of VFAs throughout the system could be attributed to some reasons. First, an inhomogeneity in pH and microbial community, etc. in the two compartments led to the disorders of microbial activity and pH value as discussed in gas production section. Second, the indigested-substrate might flow-through the bulkhead directly without hydrolysis and acidogenesis and then resulted in reducing methanogenesis. Third, a microbial wash-out occurred at the tested short HRTs because longer HRTs of 15–30 days has been reported to be compulsory to prevent a washout of methanogenic biomass and to allow enough time for efficient feedstock degradation (Schmidt et al., 2014)."
10,"Removals of COD, carbohydrate, lipid and protein","3.3 Removals of COD, carbohydrate, lipid and protein To show the advantage of the new design bioreactor the removal efficiency of waste feedstock was elucidated. Fig. 4 shows the profile of the COD, carbohydrate, lipid and protein removal efficiencies for the TCR system. The overall system removal efficiency was calculated basing on the data differences of the influent substrate and the effluent contents collected at port 3 for each tested HRT. As shown in Fig. 4, this TCR had a nearly-completed carbohydrate degradation whilst COD, lipid and protein had insignificant degradations for all the tested HRTs. Similar results of easy degradation of carbohydrate than lipid or protein in anaerobic systems had been shown in many reports (Yasin et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015). Moreover, Fig. 4 also shows that although the removal efficiencies of COD, carbohydrate, lipid and protein were different but they were somehow HRT-dependent with two HRT groups of 10–5 d and 3–2 d. For the HRTs of 10–5 d, same levels of removal efficiencies were obtained for COD 47.8–50.7%, lipid 47.2–48.4%, protein 51.1–53.6% and carbohydrate 75.8–79.5%. For the HRTs of 3 and 2 d, these removal efficiencies increased slightly with values of COD 57.0–58.5%, lipid 57.0–58.4%, protein 60.5–62.6% and carbohydrate 77.5–79.1%. Lipid is reported to have negative effects on anaerobic digestion. In this study, the lipid concentration was roughly 17.7 g/L which was equivalent to a COD fraction (w/w) of 44% (w/w, COD basis) and this makes the feedstock a lipid-rich substrate. Such high percentage of lipid content might result in a low biogas production caused from effectiveness of inhibition, accumulation and scum flotation and clogging problems (Hu et al., 2018). The negative effectives of the presence of lipid in anaerobic digestion could be reduced via acid and alkali pre-treatments for lipid-rich substrates (Salama et al., 2019). On the other hand, a protein degradation would be affected negatively by high carbohydrate concentrations (Li et al., 2017). In the present work, the carbohydrate concentration was 15.23 g/L in the substrate."
11,Variations of microbial community,"3.4 Variations of microbial community 3.4.1 Hydrogen compartment Anaerobic fermentation is a complex microbial process involving a symbiosis between various microorganisms for hydrolysis, acidogenesis and methanogenesis. These microorganisms can be divided into bacteria and archaea with the former decomposing complex substrates into VFAs, carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and the later responding for methane production. Fig. 5 a shows the relative abundance of bacterial and archaeal communities at phylum level and they varied substantially throughout the tested HRTs in the HC. The microbial communities shifted with HRT variations. At HRTs of 10 and 7 d, Euryarchaeota (34–35%) was the most dominant archaeal phylum in the control, followed by bacteria of Bacteroidetes (28–33%), other phylum bacteria (8–14%) and Firmicutes (11–16%) and Synergistetes (2–5%). The appearance of archaea in the HC could be attributed to a sedimentation of methanogens from the MC because of low substrate up-flow from the HC. With decreasing HRT, the populations of Firmicutes dramatically increased whereas Euryarchaeota having an opposite trend; followed by Bacteroidetes and other phylum bacteria. At HRT 2 d, Firmicutes was overwhelmingly dominant and accounted for over 70% in population; whilst Euryarchaeota and other phylum archaea accounted for less than 5%. The increase of Firmicutes could be caused by a HRT reduction which increasing the relative abundance of acid-producing bacteria during the acidogenesis phase. Firmicutes could utilize macromolecules such as carbohydrates and produce VFAs as end products (Antwi et al., 2017). Therefore, the increased abundance of the phylum Firmicutes could be mainly attributed to the availability of the food waste substrate to support their rapid growths (Fisgativa et al., 2017; Li et al., 2015). Some researches might explain the results. Food waste contained naturally present bacteria species such as Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and fungal species (Fisgativa et al., 2017). Moreover, acid-producing bacteria would increase during an acidogenesis phase and the dominant methanogenic bacteria were of acetate-utilizers (Li et al., 2015). This suggests that an acidification can easily occur in anaerobic digestion systems with a mismatch between bacteria’s and archaea’s metabolisms. Fig. 5b shows a marked difference of bacterial and archaeal relative abundance (at genus level) in the HC. For instance, other archaea were the main genus at HRT 10 d, accounting for 30.42%. The dominant bacteria were Bacteroides (24.33%), other bacteria (16.18%), Clostridium sensu stricto 2 (9.93%) and C. sensu stricto 10 (4.99%). The proportion of other genus archaea reduced drastically with the reduction of HRT, from 32.93% at HRT 10 d to 1.04% at HRT 2 d. On the contrary, the proportion of C. sensu stricto 2, C. sensu stricto 10 and Bacteroides increased to 32.16, 18.75 and 14.10% respectively, as the HRT decreased. Clostridium spp. produces hydrogen efficiently during anaerobic fermentation (Jang et al., 2015). Besides, Clostridium spp. is committed to accelerating the hydrolysis of polysaccharide and generating butyrate (Slezak et al., 2017). In this study, C. sensu stricto 2 was the main genus for enhancing hydrogen production in the HC with short HRTs. This result suggests that the bioactivity of hydrogen producers could be greatly enhanced with an abundant substrate at short HRTs. 3.4.2 Methane compartment 3.4.2.1 Microbial community at phylum level Fig. 6 a illustrates the relative abundance of bacterial community structures (at phylum level) at various HRTs during methane production in the MC. At HRT 10 d, the most dominant archaeal phylum in the control was Euryarchaeota (49.09%), followed by other phylum bacteria (17.68%), Firmicutes (14.91%) and Bacteroidetes (14.05%). When the HRT was reduced from 7 to 3 d, the proportion of Euryarchaeota increased slightly from 58.04 to 61.52%; but other phylum bacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes decreased to 11.36, 8.54 and 8.16%, respectively. When the HRT was further reduced to the optimal value of 2 d, a great decrease (to 42.56%) was observed in the population of Euryarchaeota but other phylum bacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes increased to 23.88, 15.06 and 10.43%, respectively. This result indicates that in the MC at short HRTs, the bacterial community prevailed on archaeal community. 3.4.2.2 Microbial community at genus level Fig. 6b presents the relative abundance of archaea (at genus level) in the MC. Methanosaeta and Methanobacterium were the dominant species at each HRT with their proportions of 23.44–28.43% at HRTs 10 and 7 d, respectively, and followed by unclassified and other genus archaea. Methanosaeta is a dominant organism in mesophilic digestions (Lin et al., 2018); Methanobacterium is a hydrogenotrophic methanogen being able to exclusively utilize hydrogen and carbon dioxide for methane formation (van Lier et al., 2008). This is one of the reasons why at these HRTs there were no hydrogen under steady-state condition in the MC. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens could syntrophically grow with syntrophic bacteria that degrading long carbon chain metabolic intermediates (e.g., butyrate and propionate) into hydrogen and acetate for methane production (Algapani et al., 2018). Besides, Bacteroidetes (8.87–18.25%) and other genus bacteria (12.49–12.82%) also appeared in the MC. Bacteroidetes is hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria being able to ferment carbohydrates or proteins (Slezak et al., 2017). The growth of Bacteroidetes at the end of fermentation probably associated with protein degradation because the carbohydrates were consumed first. At the optimal HRT of 2 d, the Methanosaeta proportion decreased by 22.14%, along with a trivial reduction in the Methanobacterium proportion by 21.95%. On the contrary, Bacteroides and other genus bacteria increased by 14.05 and 23.59%, respectively as compared to longer HRTs. The archaeal reduction along with the bacterial increment in the MC could be attributed to the fact that a HRT reduction caused a selective pressure on slow-growing microorganisms, which might result in the shifts of microbial community (Shin et al., 2010). In general, the result presented the relative abundance of the methanogenic community over time to adapt to HRT variations, in which hydrogen-producing bacteria prevailed on methanogenic archaea due to high substrate concentrations at short HRTs. Furthermore, Methanosaeta is often dominant at low substrate concentration (van Lier et al., 2008)."
12,Comparison with literature data,"3.5 Comparison with literature data Table 5 compares the data obtained in the present work with previous studies of hydrogen and methane production via single and two-stage processes. Our study indicates that biohythane could be produced from food waste at 40 g COD/L by a single-stage anaerobic fermentation in a TCR bioreactor. This is actually in line with an investigation, showing that biohythane can be potentially achieved in single-stage anaerobic digestion processes (Pasupuleti and Venkata Mohan, 2015). At optimal HRT 2 d, TCR shows a peak HPR of 714 mL/L-d and MPR of 254 mL/L-d, even though the working volume of HC was smaller than that of MC. This is because in the HC the food waste substrate was rapidly degraded by acidogenic bacteria into a large amount of VFAs. Subsequently, the methanogenesis was inhibited by acidic environments and short HRT which were unfair to the growth of methanogens. Our results agree with the work of Chu et al. (2012), who reported that higher HPR of 2.1 L/L-d compared to MPR of 1.2 L/L-d approximately twice when the working volume of the methane reactor (5 L) was bigger than that of a hydrogen reactor (1 L) in a two-stage anaerobic digestion using a food waste substrate."
13,Conclusion,"Biohythane production using a two-compartment reactor via a single-stage anaerobic fermentation was demonstrated as an applicable process. This TCR system exhibited stable hydrogen and methane production for over 200 days of operation and had HRT-dependent removal efficiencies for COD, carbohydrate, lipid and protein contents with values of 47.8–58.5, 47.2–58.4, 51.1–62.6 and 75.8–79.1%, respectively. Moreover, HRT significantly affects biohythane production and microbial community structures. HRT 2 d resulted in peak HPR of 714 mL/L-d and MPR of 254 mL/L-d with Clostridium sensu stricto 2 and Methanosaeta being the dominant species in the hydrogenesis and methanogenesis compartments, respectively."
