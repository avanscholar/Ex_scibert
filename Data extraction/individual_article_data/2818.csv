0,Introduction,"Ethanol is an important renewable fuel that can contribute to the reduction of negative environmental impacts by fossil fuels [1]. China is the third largest ethanol producer in the world [2], and cassava-derived ethanol production has been increasing due to its economic benefits compared to other ethanol-producing crops in the country [3]. However, large amounts of wastewater (cassava stillage), containing high concentrations of organics and suspended solids are produced during the ethanol production process. In addition, the waste temperature could be as high as 90°C after distillation separation. Our previous study showed that cassava stillage is suitable for thermophilic anaerobic treatment and that the contained organics could be converted to fatty acids, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and consequently to methane [4]. Compared with methane, the intermediate product, hydrogen is a more important industrial commodity which is widely used for syntheses of ammonia, alcohols and aldehydes [5]. Hydrogen could be produced by fermentation from organic wastes such as household solid waste [6], sewage sludge [7] and winery wastewater [8]. It was reported that the carbohydrate contained in the wastes was effective and reliable for fermentative hydrogen production [9,10]. Thus cassava stillage should be of interest as a potential substrate for hydrogen production. Considering the high temperature of cassava stillage, thermophilic and extreme-thermophilic conditions may be more suitable without additional costly pre-cooling facilities. Fermentative temperature can affect hydrogen production by influencing the microorganism composition and activity of enzymes such as hydrogenases [11]. It was reported that the hydrogen yield obtained under thermophilic condition could be as high as 2.4mol H2/mol hexose, much higher than the value of less than 2.0mol H2/mol hexose from mesophilic condition [12–15]. The maximum hydrogen yields of 2.68 and 2.47mol H2/mol hexose were obtained at 75°C [16] and 70°C [17], respectively. However, when using cassava starch as substrate, Lee et al. [18] found that the hydrogen production obtained at 37°C was six times higher than that of 55°C. The suitable temperature range for hydrogen production from cassava stillage is still unknown. During the fermentative hydrogen production, high concentrations of volatile fatty acids such as butyric and acetic acids can be accumulated in the system and result in the drop of pH if not properly controlled. pH variation may alter the quantity of hydrogen production, aqueous product, substrate utilization efficiency and microbial community. Many studies were conducted on the effect of initial pH under mesophilic condition [19–21], but the obtained results were inconsistent and the optimal pH differed from one study to another. For example, Khanal et al. [19] reported that acidic initial pH was favorable for hydrogen production, while Lee et al. [20] found that alkaline initial pH was suitable for hydrogen production through batch tests. The disagreements in the optimal temperature and pH in different studies may be resulted from the differences in substrates, seed sludge and operation conditions. In addition, there are few studies focusing on the effect of pH on hydrogen production under thermophilic condition. It is necessary to investigate the effects of temperature and pH on hydrogen production from the same substrate by certain seed sludge. Currently, few reports are available on the systematical investigation of hydrogen producing characteristics of mesophilic anaerobic sludge from real wastes under different temperature and pH ranges. Mesophilic anaerobic sludge as seed sludge for hydrogen production can easily be obtained since most of the anaerobic reactors were operated under mesophilic conditions [22–24]. By pretreatments (e.g. heat, acid and base), the methanogens in the mesophilic anaerobic sludge can be inhibited while hydrogen producing bacteria can be enriched [25]. Homoacetogens and methanogens are two hydrogen consuming microorganisms and will lead to the lower hydrogen yields if they are not inhibited [7]. However, the inhibition effectiveness of pretreatment on their activities is still questionable; as hydrogen consumption was still observed even when the inoculum was pretreated [26]. Further study is necessary to elucidate the activities of homoacetogens and methanogens under different fermentation conditions. This study was conducted to explore the feasibility of hydrogen production from cassava stillage by mesophilic anaerobic sludge. The effects of temperature (mesophilic, thermophilic and extreme-thermophilic) and initial pH (4–10) on the hydrogen production were investigated and the involved mechanisms were discussed. In addition, the activities of homoacetogens and methanogens in the hydrogen production process were also discussed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Cassava stillage composition and seed sludge,"2.1 Cassava stillage composition and seed sludge Cassava stillage used in this study was obtained directly from Taicang cassava ethanol plant (Jiangsu, China). The characteristics of cassava stillage are as follows: total solids (TS) 47.9g/l, volatile solids (VS) 40.5g/l, total carbohydrate 28.2g/l, soluble carbohydrate 4.3g/l and total protein 5.7g/l. After collection, cassava stillage was stored at 4°C before usage. The seed sludge was taken from a mesophilic upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) from the same ethanol plant. Concentrations of volatile suspended solids and total suspended solids, as well as the pH value of the inoculum were 42g/l, 70g/l, and 7.5, respectively. Before use, the anaerobic sludge was heated at 90°C for 1h to enrich hydrogen-producing anaerobes."
3,Experimental design and procedure,"2.2 Experimental design and procedure Batch hydrogen production tests were performed in 250ml vials. The vials were similar to those described in [27]. Seed sludge of 40ml and raw cassava stillage of 140ml were added to each bottle and the working volume was adjusted to 200ml with distilled water. The initial pH value of the mixed solution in each bottle was adjusted by 2N HCl or 2N NaOH. Nitrogen gas was purged into bottles for 5min to provide anaerobic conditions. The capped bottles with rubber stoppers were placed in a water bath shaker (Kexing, China) preset at 150rpm. First, the temperature was preset at 37°C (mesophilic), 60°C (thermophilic) and 70°C (extreme-thermophilic) with initial pH 7 to find the optimal fermentation temperature by anaerobic sludge. Then, experiments on the effects of initial pH were conducted in the range of 4–10 at an interval of 1 at the optimal temperature. Each test was carried out in triplicates and analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 0.05 level was used to analyze the data. The evolved biogas was collected through a vapor trap in an aluminized polyethylene bag (GL Sciences, Japan). The amount of biogas in the gas bags was determined every 5–10h using a syringe (50ml). Volume determinations were made by allowing the syringe plunger to move and equilibrate between the gasbag and atmospheric pressures [28]. Then, the syringe was held horizontally for measurement. The readings for the biogas volume were taken at room temperature. At the same time the compositions of the biogas in the gas bag and headspace of the bottles were measured. The measured hydrogen volume was calibrated to the volume at STP (standard temperature 0°C and pressure 1atm). The cumulative hydrogen production was calculated by the following equation: (1) V h , i = V h , i - 1 + C h , i V hg , i + ( C hh , i - C hh , i - 1 ) V he where Vh , i and Vh , i −1 are cumulative hydrogen gas volumes at the current (i) and previous (i −1) time intervals, Ch , i and Vhg , i are the fractions of hydrogen gas and biogas volumes in the gas bag at the current (i) time interval, Chh , i and Chh , i −1 are the fractions of hydrogen gas in the headspace of the bottle at the current (i) and previous (i −1) time intervals, Vhe is the total volume of headspace in the reactor. The cumulative hydrogen production process in the batch tests were simulated by the modified Gompertz equation as follows: (2) H ( t ) = P · exp - exp R m · e P ( λ - t) + 1 where H (ml) is the cumulative H2 production, P (ml) is the H2 production potential, R m (ml/h) is the maximum H2 production rate, λ (h) is the lag-phase time. The meaning of each parameter was described in [29]. The values of P, R m and λ for each batch can be determined by best fitting the H2 production data for Eq. (2) using the origin 7.5."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Samples were centrifuged at 3500rpm for 10min and filtrated through 0.45μm filters to determine soluble components. TS, VS and ammonia were analyzed in duplicates in accordance with Standard APHA Methods [30]. The determinations of carbohydrates and proteins were described in the study of [31].VFA (C2-C5) and ethanol were determined by a gas chromatograph (HP6890II) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a CPWAX52CB column (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm). The temperature of the injector and FID were 200°C and 220°C, respectively. Nitrogen was the carrier gas with a flow rate of 50ml/min. The GC oven was programmed to begin at 70°C and remain there for 2min, then increase at a rate of 10°C/min to 220°C, and remain at 220°C for an additional 2min. The sample injection volume was 1.0μl. The biogas composition (H2, CH4 and CO2) was determined using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-14B) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a stainless steel column packed with Carbosive S II (diameter of 3.2mm and 2.0m length). Injector, detector and column temperatures were kept at 100°C, 105°C and 60°C, respectively. The carrier was nitrogen and the flow rate used was 30ml/min. The sample injection volume was 0.2ml."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effects of temperature on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effects of temperature on hydrogen production Fermentative hydrogen production at three typical temperatures 37°C, 60°C and 70°C, representing mesophilic, thermophilic and extreme-thermophilic fermentation respectively, was conducted at initial pH 7 with mesophilic anaerobic sludge as inoculum. Fig. 1 a illustrates the time courses of hydrogen production during 85h fermentation at different temperatures. The cumulative hydrogen production data were well fitted to the modified Gompertz equation with R 2 >0.99 (Table 1 ) and the obtained parameters were strongly temperature dependent. The highest P value of 307ml was observed at 60°C, which was 53.5% and 198% higher than the values at 37°C and 70°C, respectively. Correspondingly, 60°C gave the highest hydrogen yield and R m. The value of λ at 37°C and 60°C were only 8.4h and 9.7h while at 70°C, it was extended to 27.6h, suggesting that microorganisms need more time to adapt to the extreme-temperature condition. Although mesophilic anaerobic sludge was used as seed sludge, thermophilic fermentation was demonstrated to be favorable for hydrogen production from cassava stillage, indicating that the mixed inoculum contained various microbial communities which could function at different temperatures. Previous studies showed that thermotolerant species could be detected in PCR-DGGE bands of mesophilic sludge [32,33]. Fig. 1b describes the variations of hydrogen compositions in the gas phase of the reactors with fermentation time. The produced biogas only contained hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Initially, the hydrogen composition increased with fermentation time. After 20h fermentation, the hydrogen composition in the gas phase began to decrease at the temperature of 37°C and 60°C, while it stabilized at 70°C. No biogas was collected after the highest hydrogen production was achieved for all conditions. Hydrogen consumption was also observed at fermentation temperatures of 60°C or 25°C [34] and homoacetogenesis played an important role [26]. It is obvious that heat-pretreatment could not inhibit homoacetogenesis and the fermentation conditions (37°C or 60°C with initial pH 7) are favorable for homoacetogenesis. The hydrogen consumption is further studied by changing pH in subsequent sections. The amount and component of VFA/ethanol reflect the metabolism of hydrogen-producing anaerobes. The different hydrogen production under different temperatures could be explained from the aspect of VFA and ethanol distribution. At 37°C, acetate, propionate and butyrate were predominant metabolites, while at 60°C butyrate and ethanol concentrations were significantly enhanced (ethanol: p =0.0003<0.05; butyrate: p =0.017<0.05) and acetate and propionate production were inhibited. Although the total amounts of VFA and ethanol were similar at 37°C and 60°C, the ratios of butyrate/acetate (B/A) and butyrate/propionate (B/P) were 2.58 and 8.6 respectively at 60°C, much higher than the values of 1.67 and 2.2 at 37°C. Higher B/A and B/P ratios were proven to be correlated with higher hydrogen production in previous studies [35,36]. At 70°C, propionate and butyrate concentrations decreased sharply while acetate and ethanol concentrations were similar with those at 60°C. The total amount of VFA and ethanol (Fig. 2 ) at 70°C was much lower than that at 37°C and 60°C, which was well in accord with its lower hydrogen yield. The hydrogen production at 70°C was not as efficient as that at 60°C or 37°C though previous studies have demonstrated that extreme-thermophilic hydrogen production from the wastes is superior compared with mesophilic or thermophilic hydrogen production [37,17,34]. The above inconsistence might be attributed to the difference in seed sludge because only cow manure or digested cow manure was used as inocula for efficient extreme-thermophilic hydrogen production. Nevertheless, the present study focused on the effects of temperature on hydrogen production from widely existed mesophilic anaerobic sludge and thermophilic hydrogen fermentation was demonstrated to be more efficient than mesophilic or extreme-thermophilic fermentation."
7,Effects of initial pH on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effects of initial pH on hydrogen production The variations of thermophilic hydrogen production with fermentation time at different initial pH are shown in Fig. 3 a. The data were also fitted to the Gompertz model (Table 2 ). The P values fluctuated with the variations of initial pH and peaked at pH 6 with the value of 383ml. The maximum R m obtained at pH 6 coincided with maximum cumulative hydrogen production. The cumulative hydrogen production at initial pH 4 and 10 were 253ml and 195ml respectively, much lower than the value at initial pH 6. However, no significant difference (p =0.43>0.05) in cumulative hydrogen production was found between pH 5 (376ml) and pH 6 (383ml). The result indicated that hydrogen could be produced efficiently in the initial pH range of 5–6. In this study, the λ was also greatly affected by the pH and shorter λ was obtained at the initial pH 7–10. The λ was as long as 27.1h at initial pH 4 while the value was only 6.8h at initial pH 9. Fig. 3b shows the variations of hydrogen compositions in the gas phase of the reactors with fermentation time. Initially, the hydrogen composition increased with fermentation time over the initial pH range investigated. When no biogas was collected in the gas bag, the hydrogen composition in the gas phase of the reactor began to decrease at the initial pH 6–10 due to the hydrogen consumption. Moreover, methane was detected at the initial pH 9 and 10 at the end of the fermentation (data not shown). The obtained result indicated that only heat-pretreatment could not inhibit methanogenesis efficiently, and the cultivation pH might be a crucial factor to inhibit methanogenesis. The inhibition of homoacetogenesis was observed with initial pH range 4–5 since a decrease in hydrogen composition was not detected, which has not been reported before. It is obvious that both homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis could be completely inhibited at 60°C with initial pH 4 and 5. Fig. 4 shows the variation of the total amount of VFA and ethanol with pH under thermophilic condition. The trend was different with that of hydrogen production. The VFA and ethanol production increased with the increase of initial pH while hydrogen production peaked at initial pH 5 and 6. The phenomenon was different from reports on fermentative hydrogen production from pure substrates. When starch was used as the substrate for hydrogen production, the total amount of VFA and ethanol peaked at initial pH 6 corresponding with the highest cumulative hydrogen production [5]. However, in a UASB reactor treating synthetic sucrose wastewater for hydrogen production, Zhao and Yu [38] found that the total amount of VFA and ethanol did not change significantly with pH variation. The different results from the above studies may be due to the different substrates. Compared with starch and sucrose, cassava stillage contains high SS. Organics from SS could be solubilized at higher initial pH condition and the newly dissolved organics could induce higher production of VFA and ethanol [39]. As shown in Fig. 4, the variations of individual VFA components during fermentation did not follow the same trend as the amount of total VFA. The increase of initial pH stimulated the production of acetate and propionate which could consume hydrogen, while inhibiting the production of butyrate. Therefore, the hydrogen production decreased with further increase of initial pH above 6."
8,Theoretical hydrogen production under different temperature and pH,"3.3 Theoretical hydrogen production under different temperature and pH The theoretical hydrogen production can be calculated from the metabolic products since carbohydrate was the main composition of cassava stillage. As shown in equations 1–3, different amounts of hydrogen could be obtained when glucose was biodegraded to different end products. Eq. (5) could be used to estimate the theoretical hydrogen production. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the measured hydrogen production was lower than theoretical hydrogen production under different temperatures and initial pH. (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O (5) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 H 2 + CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 (6) C 6 H 2 O 6 → 2CH 3 CH 2 OH + 2CO 2 (7) Hydrogen(mol) → 2 × (butyrate) + 2 × (acetate) - ( propionate ) A possible explanation for such a difference was that part of the acetate was produced by homoacetogenesis accompanying with hydrogen consumption, but not from the degradation of glucose. Another reason was that the produced hydrogen was consumed by methanogenesis which led to the lower measured hydrogen since methane was detected at initial pH 9 and 10 at 60°C. However, it is difficult to explain the difference between theoretical and measured hydrogen production at 70°C with initial pH 7 and at 60°C with initial pH 4–5, because decrease of hydrogen composition and/or production of methane were not observed in the whole process. It was speculated that the acetate obtained at 70°C might be not only be from the degradation of glucose but also from the degradation of protein contained in cassava stillage. By stickland reaction, the degradation of protein can lead to the production of acetate without hydrogen production [40]. The higher ammonia concentration (455mg/l) at 70°C with initial pH 7 compared with initial value (242mg/l) in the fermented liquid supported this speculation (Table 1). The increase of ammonia concentration was not observed at pH 4–5 at 60°C. However, the degradation of protein might really occur considering the produced ammonia nitrogen is an essential nutrient for bacterial growth which could be simultaneously consumed [41]."
9,Hydrogen production characteristics under optimal fermentation condition,"3.4 Hydrogen production characteristics under optimal fermentation condition Initial pH 6 was thought to be the optimal condition considering more VFA and ethanol production (18% higher than pH 5), although hydrogen production at initial pH 5 was nearly equal to that at pH 6 and homoacetogenesis was inhibited. To better understand the hydrogen production process under optimal conditions, the variations of VFA and ethanol production, mixture pH and cumulative hydrogen production with fermentation time were monitored. The result is shown in Fig. 5 . It is obvious that butyrate was the main metabolic byproduct and the hydrogen production increased significantly with the increase of butyrate concentration. Although acetate increased from 0 to 668mg/l at fermentation time 0–12h, no obvious hydrogen production was observed. Meanwhile ammonia concentration increased from 242mg/l to 306mg/l, indicating that the acetate was produced from the degradation of protein without hydrogen production. After 12h of fermentation, ammonia concentration remained relatively stable, while the acetate concentration decreased gradually with increase of ethanol concentration. The result was consistent with the finding that the acetate could be converted to ethanol at higher hydrogen partial pressure [26]. After fermentation for about 58h, the acetate concentration increased again, and the trend correlated with the variations of hydrogen composition in the gas phase as described in Fig. 3b, further indicating that the decrease of hydrogen content in gas phase resulted from the consumption of hydrogen to acetate by homoacetogenesis. The fermentation pH was in the range 5.2–6.0, which was also suitable for hydrogen production. Under optimal condition, the hydrogen yield from cassava stillage by anaerobic granular sludge was 67.8 ml H2/gVS added or 0.78mol H2/mol hexose. The yield was relatively lower (<2mol H2/mol hexose) since most carbohydrate was in the suspended solids and difficult to be utilized (the soluble carbohydrate was only 4.3g/l while total carbohydrate was 28.2g/l). However, the yield was still comparable or even higher than some actual wastes. The hydrogen yield was 68.6ml H2/gVS from acid-pretreated beer lees at 36°C [42], while the maximum hydrogen yield from alkaline-pretreated waste sludge was only 14.4ml/g VS at 37°C [7]. Higher hydrogen yield could be obtained if the cassava stillage is properly pretreated. On the other hand, the hydrogen production process could be coupled with methane production as the second step to further utilize the VFA in the effluent. It has been demonstrated that the methane production in a two-stage (hydrogen+methane) process was higher than traditional single methane production from household solid waste [6]. It is suggested to further study and optimize the two-stage process for hydrogen and methane production from cassava stillage to obtain more energy."
10,Conclusions,"Thermophilic hydrogen production from cassava stillage by mesophilic anaerobic sludge was proven to be more efficient than that of mesophilic and extreme-thermophilic fermentation conditions in this study. The higher hydrogen production under thermophilic condition corresponded with the enhanced butyrate production and lower propionate production. Moreover, the full inhibition of butyrate under extreme-thermophilic condition led to much lower hydrogen production. Experimental results of pH influence showed that initial pH 6 was optimal for hydrogen production at 60°C while lower or higher initial pH resulted in lower hydrogen production. The higher pH resulted in higher total VFA, ethanol and acetate concentration. The increase of acetate concentration at higher initial pH could be attributed to the higher activity of homoacetogens and degradation efficiency of protein. Homoacetogenesis was inhibited at lower initial pH 4–5. In addition, heat-pretreatment of anaerobic sludge was not sufficient to fully inhibit the activity of methanogens, and a combination of heat-pretreatment and low cultivation pH was required to prevent methanogenesis."
