0,Introduction,"Alcohol is one of the most widely used psychoactive substances worldwide. Harmful use of alcohol causes approximately 3 million deaths each year and increases the risk for many serious diseases, including alcohol use disorder (AUD), cardiovascular diseases, cancers, liver cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease and neuropsychiatric disorders [1,2]. One important consequence of alcohol abuse is that heavy drinkers are more likely to develop pain disorders and increased sensitivity to painful stimulation. Besides, AUD was also found to be a major predictor of pain severity following a serious injury [3–5]. However, the exact relationship between AUD and alcohol-induced pain disorders remains obscure. In 1992, LVV-hemorphin-7 (LVV-H7), an opioid-like peptide derived from the degradation of hemoglobin β-globin chain, was isolated from the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid of patients with cerebrovascular bleedings [6]. Highly stable LVV-H7 is found in high concentration (μM range) in human plasma [6–8]. Previous studies indicate that LVV-H7 exhibits different affinities to many receptors, including opioid receptors, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP; angiotensin IV receptors), etc. [9–14]. However, the exact biological functions of LVV-H7 remain unclear. In our previous studies, LVV-H7 was found to produce analgesia and anti-hyperalgesia effects at the spinal level in rodents. These effects were through its blockade on IRAP to reduce oxytocin degradation [15,16]. Although LVV-H7 exhibits a low binding affinity to opioid receptors, its abundance in blood may compensate this defect and plays an important role in pain regulation [9,17]. Cathepsin D, the major enzyme in LVV-H7 production, is activated by alcohol and lower pH in vitro. However, cathepsin D is markedly unstable at an acidic pH, presumably reflecting of autolysis [18–20]. In fact, the blood pH might be low in the patients with AUD [21–23]. Hence, we speculate that chronic alcohol exposure may affect the activity or level of cathepsin D and subsequently change the level of LVV-H7. Alcohol use and abuse can lead to alcohol-induced hematologic complications, for example anemia. Alcohol-induced anemia can be caused by multiple mechanisms, including folate and iron deficiency, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypersplenism or liver diseases, interferences in erythropoiesis and hemoglobin synthesis [24,25]. Many anemic patients are found to suffer from different types of pain disorders [26–29], in particular, some patients experience increasing pain when the hemoglobin levels drop [30,31]. However, the association between anemia and pain remain concealed. We speculate that alcohol-induced anemia may reduce the level of LVV-H7, thereby leading to pain disorders. Numerous studies indicate that there is a high comorbidity between AUD and chronic pain, even 73.8 % of the AUD patients reported experiencing pain-related problems in the past month [32–34]. However, the causative factor of alcohol-induced pain disorders is yet to be fully elucidated. We hypothesize that AUD causes anemia and decreases the level of LVV-H7 to induce hyperalgesia. The AUD patients shall be mostly under alcohol withdrawal upon consultation for their possible complications. Thus, it may trigger the incidence of hyperalgesia. Generally, human alcohol consumption is more chronic and with longer-term, AUD patients are more likely to encounter hyperalgesia and consume more analgesics than required. However, real patients with AUD might be underestimated as they may not seek medical treatment unless suffering from AUD complications [35,36]. Previous studies indicate that substance use disorder (SUD) and chronic pain sometimes occur together [37–39]. In population-based cohort studies, individuals with chronic pain were approximately 2.1 times more likely to develop SUD than individuals without chronic pain [40], and individuals with SUD were approximately 1.6 times more likely to develop chronic pain [41]. However, the causal relationship between SUD and chronic pain remains to be completely elucidated. Among the substances abused, alcohol is the most commonly abused substance. Nearly 38 % of the heavy drinkers reported using alcohol to manage pain [42]. Verification of the mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced pain disorders may have practical implications for pain management. Moreover, once pain is relieved, patients with AUD may consume less alcohol. Therefore, we hypothesized that alcohol exposure may increase the activity of cathepsin D and the level of LVV-H7 to trigger analgesia. In contrast, removal of alcohol and chronic alcohol-induced anemia may decrease the LVV-H7 production to cause hyperalgesia during alcohol withdrawal. The altered levels of LVV-H7 may play an important role in the development of alcohol-induced pain disorders, including alcohol-induced analgesia (AA) and alcohol withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia (AWH)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Animals,"2.1 Animals Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (8 weeks old, 250–275 g) were obtained from BioLASCO Taiwan Co. (Taipei, Taiwan). Rats were housed in a 12-h light/dark cycle and controlled temperature (23 ± 2 °C) with free access to food and water. One week after the acclimatization to the new environment, the rats were taken to the testing room in the afternoon on the day of experiments; the experiments were carried out during the evening. The experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and ethical animal research, and were approved by the local animal care and use committee (National Defense Medical Center, Taiwan, license number IACUC-16-208)."
3,Chronic alcohol exposure model,"2.2 Chronic alcohol exposure model To investigate the connection between LVV-H7 and AA/AWH, we established a rat model of chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal. In male SD rats, alcohol dependence was induced by a daily, single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 % (weight/volume percentage concentration; abbreviated as w/v) ethanol at 0.5 g/kg for 15 days [43,44]. Based on the previous studies, this model was equivalent to replicate moderate to heavy drinkers [45–47]. Turning to alcohol withdrawal syndrome and hyperalgesia are common problems in clinical practice [48–50]. Hence, to replicate these health problems, the rats were withdrawn from chronic alcohol exposure for 5 days to assess the biochemical and behavioral changes during alcohol withdrawal period. The blood level of LVV-H7 in the rats was measured and compared with their corresponding pain-related behavior. Co-administration of cathepsin D inhibitor (pepstatin) [51,52] and exogenous LVV-H7 with alcohol were applied to investigate the correlation between LVV-H7 and pain-related behavior. The pain sensation was determined by using tail-flick and hot plate tests. Furthermore, we quantified the hematological parameters and cathepsin D levels to explore the possible mechanisms of LVV-H7 alteration. At different time points, blood samples were obtained for the measurements of blood pH values, red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin counts, and the level of LVV-H7/cathepsin D in plasma (Fig. 1 )."
4,Animal groups,"2.3 Animal groups The rats were randomly divided into 4 groups and treated with different agents (Fig. 1). Rats in the control group received a single i.p. injection of 0.9 % normal saline (equal volume to alcohol) for 15 days and discontinued in the following 5 days. The alcohol group received a daily single i.p. injection of 10 % ethanol (0.5 g/kg) for 15 days and discontinued in the following 5 days. The alcohol, alcohol + LVV-H7 (ALLVV), and alcohol + pepstatin (ALPEP) groups received the same procedures of alcohol administration. But the ALLVV group received an additional daily intravenous (i.v.) tail vein injection of exogenous LVV-H7 (0.06 mg/kg) 4 h after alcohol administration (and also after behavioral tests and blood sampling), whereas ALPEP group received i.p. co-administration of pepstatin (10 mg/kg) and alcohol (i.p.) at the same time point. Based on the previous study by Alamir et al., i.p. injections of pepstatin (10 mg/kg) is sufficient to inhibit the cathepsin D activity in vivo [51,52]."
5,Tail-flick test,"2.4 Tail-flick test The antinociceptive effects of drugs were assayed with a tail-flick analgesia meter (MK-330, Muromachi Kikai Co. Ltd., Japan). Rats were slightly restrained with a cloth covering their eyes and placed on the top of the instrument. The tail-flick response was measured by applying a focused beam of ultra-red ray to the dorsal surface of the tail. The latency of the tail-flick response was determined and defined as the time between the onset of heat stimulus and involuntary tail withdrawal. The intensity was set to 70, which could make the basal tail-flick latency (before chronic saline/alcohol administration) between 3.5 and 4 s in control animals. A cut-off time was set at 10 s to avoid injury on the tail [53]. Measurement of the tail-flick latency was repeated 5 times per rat. The data were collected by averaging all the 5 latencies measured, but the values beyond 2 standard deviations were excluded. The Δtail-flick latency was calculated and obtained by subtracting the basal latency (Day 0) from the latency at a particular time point."
6,Hot plate test,"2.5 Hot plate test The hot plate test was used in testing the analgesic effectiveness of drugs by observing the behavioral reaction to pain caused by the heat originated from the floor surface to paw, such as jumping and hind paw-licking elicited can be observed [54]. An Ugo Basile 35150 - Hot/Cold Plate (Italy) was used to measure the latency of paw lifting. The rat was placed on the metal plate heated to 55 °C, which was surrounded by a glass cylinder (13cm × 17cm). A cut-off time of 2 min was applied to avoid injury. The latency was defined as the time interval between the zero point, when the animal was placed on the hot plate surface, and the time point when the animal licked or lifted its paw [55]. The Δhot plate paw withdrawal latency was calculated and obtained by subtracting the basal latency (Day 0) from the latency at a particular time point."
7,"Measurement of RBC, hemoglobin count, and pH in blood","2.6 Measurement of RBC, hemoglobin count, and pH in blood Previous studies indicate that (i) in vitro exposure to 1% and greater alcohol exhibited a time- and dose-dependent toxicity. (ii) Alcohol directly denatures the proteins by disrupting intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Yet, 10 % ethanol (0.5 g/kg) used in this study has been proven to be metabolized within 4 h in rats [56–59]. To avoid the direct effects caused by acute alcohol administration, we chose 4 h after alcohol administration as the blood sampling time. To avoid the stress caused by repeated blood sampling of rats, we conducted the behavioral tests before blood sampling. Blood samples with a volume of approximately 0.4 mL were collected in EDTA tubes on Day 0, 1, 7, 11, 15, and 20. The blood pH values were measured by using a pH meter (Laboratory pH meter; SI Analytics, Weilheim, Germany). Then, 50 μL of the blood sample were used to analyze the red blood cell (RBC) and hemoglobin counts with an automatic cell counter (Sysmex KX-21 N Hematology Analyzer; Sysmex America Inc., Mundelein, IL, USA). The remaining blood volumes were centrifuged at 1500 x g for 15 min at 4 °C immediately, the plasma volume was collected for the measurement of LVV-H7 and cathepsin D levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits."
8,ELISA to determine the level of LVV-H7 and cathepsin D in plasma,"2.7 ELISA to determine the level of LVV-H7 and cathepsin D in plasma The plasmas obtained on Day 0, 1, 7, 11, 15, and 20 were used to measure the levels of LVV-H7 and cathepsin D. The levels were measured in duplicate with their corresponding ELISA kits [LVV-H7 (catalog number: ADI-900−205): Enzo Life Sciences Inc., Farmingdale, NY; cathepsin D (catalog number: SEB280Ra): USCN Life Science Inc., Wuhan, China] according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each 100 μl of plasma was used for determination of serum levels of LVV-H7 and cathepsin D. Samples with higher concentrations were diluted to fit into the standard curve and calculated to obtain the exact concentration by multiplying the dilution fold."
9,Statistical analysis,"2.8 Statistical analysis The data were shown as mean ± SEM of n determinations, where n represents the number of animals studied. All statistical analyses were performed using the program Prism 5 for Windows (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA). The Bonferroni post-hoc test was used to compare all pairs of means, following two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and determined the significance in each comparison (P < 0.05). Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated and used to examine the linear relationship between two variables, the significance level was set at P < 0.05."
10,Results,
11,The effects of alcohol on nociception,"3.1 The effects of alcohol on nociception The basal tail-flick and hot plate paw withdrawal latencies were similar among groups (values between 3.54 and 3.73 s for tail-flick tests in all groups; values between 10.26 and 10.66 s for hot plate tests in all groups) (Fig. 2 ). The Δtail-flick and Δhot plate paw withdrawal latencies in the control group were not significantly changed throughout the experimental period (from Day 0 to Day 20). However, the tail-flick latencies started to significantly increase on Day 10 and slowly decreased during alcohol exposure, which could be referring to AA (Fig. 2A). On Day 15, the tail-flick latency returned to the basal value, suggesting an absence of AA. In contrast, tail-flick latencies gradually decreased to the level below basal during alcohol withdrawal. Compared with the basal values, tail-flick latencies significantly decreased on Day 19–20 (Fig. 2). This could be considered as AWH. In the tail-flick test of alcohol + LVV-H7 (ALLVV) group, AA was present earlier (Day 6) and lasted longer (Day 15), as compared with that of alcohol group (Fig. 2A). Moreover, AWH was completely abolished by exogenous LVV-H7 administration. The latencies were maintained and had no obvious decreases during alcohol withdrawal. When pepstatin was co-administered with alcohol in the alcohol + pepstatin (ALPEP) group, AA was completely abolished. No significant difference in latencies was observed between the control and ALPEP groups from Day 0 to Day 15. During alcohol withdrawal, pepstatin completely inhibited the expression of AWH. The latencies were not significantly decreased from Day 16–20. In the hot plate test of alcohol group, alcohol began to stimulate a significant increase in latency on Day 4 (Fig. 2B), which persisted until Day 13, thus suggesting an apparent AA determined by the hot plate test. Similar results were observed in rats with AWH. After Day 15, the latencies were gradually decreased but surprisingly reversed to the basal levels on Day 20. In the ALLVV group, exogenous LVV-H7 injections potentiated AA as well. The latencies were significantly longer than those of the alcohol group on Day 10, 12 and 14. Even during alcohol withdrawal, the latencies were still longer than those of the control group, which was also observed in the results from the tail-flick test. In the ALPEP group, pepstatin co-administration attenuated, but not completely blocked the AA. This is different from the findings in the tail-flick test. However, pepstatin also completely blocked the AWH in the hot plate test."
12,The effects of alcohol on the LVV-H7 level,"3.2 The effects of alcohol on the LVV-H7 level The basal plasma levels (before alcohol administration) of LVV-H7 were not significantly different among groups (between 1.25 and 1.36 μM) (Fig. 3 A). Without alcohol exposure, LVV-H7 levels were not significantly changed over the whole experimental period in the control group. However, LVV-H7 levels had distinct changes at different time points during alcohol exposure. Alcohol led to a significant increase in LVV-H7 level on Day 7 (1.83 ± 0.28 μM), but reverted to the basal level on Day 11 (1.31 ± 0.16 μM). Eventually, alcohol induced a significant decrease on Day 15 (0.79 ± 0.20 μM). During alcohol withdrawal, LVV-H7 level almost returned to the basal level (1.03 ± 0.21 μM). When exogenous LVV-H7 was given, the levels of LVV-H7 were significantly higher than those of the control and alcohol groups on Day 7, 11, 15, and 20. In contrast, pepstatin co-administration completely blocked the alcohol-induced increased level of LVV-H7 on Day 7. Besides, pepstatin totally blocked the alcohol-induced decrease of LVV-H7 on Day 15 (1.24 ± 0.12 μM). On Day 20, the LVV-H7 level in the ALPEP group returned to the basal level, which was comparable to that in the alcohol group."
13,Connection between LVV-H7 and alcohol-induced pain disorders,"3.3 Connection between LVV-H7 and alcohol-induced pain disorders In verifying the connection between the change of LVV-H7 level and AA/AWH, we found that the level of LVV-H7 was negatively correlated with the expression of pain-related behavior with a short delay (Figs. 2 and 3). Alcohol-induced increase of LVV-H7 was significant on Day 7, but there was no significant increase of tail-flick latency until Day 10. However, the increase of paw withdrawal latency started on Day 4 and persisted until Day 13. This implies that the alcohol-induced increase of LVV-H7 could affect the supraspinal pain circuits earlier than those at the spinal level, thereafter causing AA. In regard to the alcohol withdrawal, the decrease of LVV-H7 manifested on Day 15, but the most severe hyperalgesia appeared on Day 19. The delayed effects of LVV-H7 change on nociceptive responses may be due to the time required for breaking the homeostasis in nociception by counteracting with other endogenous systems of pain enhancement or reduction. Besides, limited blood samplings with long intervals could affect a match of time course between the results of behavior and LVV-H7 in data interpretation. In order to prevent a mistake in connecting two parallel individual observations with no evidence, we applied exogenous LVV-H7 and pepstatin as tools to verify the correlation. LVV-H7 administration clearly potentiated AA and abolished AWH. Co-administration of pepstatin showed a complete blockade (tail-flick) or attenuation (hot plate) on AA, and also abolished AWH. These results emphasize the decrease of LVV-H7 should be responsible for the incidence of AWH. Nevertheless, our results showed pepstatin could keep LVV-H7 at the basal level throughout the experimental period. It seems that the amelioration of the decrease in the LVV-H7 level is more important for the elimination of hyperalgesia. Most importantly, we examined the correlations between the LVV-H7 levels and Δtail-flick latencies. Using the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the linear correlation, we discovered significant positive correlations between the LVV-H7 levels andΔtail-flick latencies (Figs. 4 and 5 ). In other words, increases in LVV-H7 can alleviate pain-related behavior, whereas the decreases of LVV-H7 can aggravate pain-related behavior. Therefore, we concluded that the effects of alcohol on pain sensation could be associated with altered level of LVV-H7."
14,Connection between LVV-H7 and alcohol-induced anemia,"3.4 Connection between LVV-H7 and alcohol-induced anemia Furthermore, we examined the chronic alcohol-induced anemia in order to explain the possible reason for the absence of LVV-H7 increment on Day 11. The basal RBC (5.33–5.59 106/μl) and hemoglobin (12.92–13 g/dL) counts were not significantly different among groups (Fig. 6 A–B). All RBC and hemoglobin counts in the control group were not significantly changed throughout the experimental period. In the alcohol group, alcohol triggered a significant decrease in both RBC and hemoglobin counts on Day 7 or 11 and reached the lowest level (RBC: 3.55 ± 0.45 106/μl; hemoglobin: 9.78 ± 0.56 g/dL) on Day 15 during alcohol exposure. On Day 20, both RBC and hemoglobin counts were slightly increased but still significantly lower than of the control group. Both exogenous LVV-H7 and pepstatin significantly attenuated alcohol-induced reduction of RBC and hemoglobin during alcohol exposure and withdrawal. These data confirmed that the alcohol-induced anemia gradually reversed after alcohol withdrawal. Interestingly, both exogenous LVV-H7 and pepstatin attenuated alcohol-induced anemia, especially decreased hemoglobin counts. This suggests that the alcohol-induced LVV-H7 decreases could be due to alcohol-induced anemia. On Day 11 and 15, the hemoglobin level was significantly decreased by alcohol. Thus, we speculate that the absence of LVV-H7 increment on Day 11 and 15 may result from the lower level of hemoglobin which was utilized to produce LVV-H7. Nevertheless, the impact of alcohol withdrawal on the level of LVV-H7 cannot be excluded since the withdrawal syndromes could start to arise on Day 15. On day 20, LVV-H7 almost reverted to the basal value. This is consistent with the gradual recovery of hemoglobin decrease on Day 20. It was known that hemolysis can destroy healthy RBC and lead to hemoglobin released into the blood plasma. However, our results from the RBC and hemoglobin counts showed a similar trend in the effects caused by alcohol. This implies that alcohol may not affect the level of LVV-H7 via a quantitative change of hemolysis."
15,Possible mechanisms of LVV-H7 alteration,"3.5 Possible mechanisms of LVV-H7 alteration We speculate that the alcohol-induced LVV-H7 decreases on Day 15 could be due to alcohol-induced anemia. However, we did not observe the increases of RBC/hemoglobin as the same trend as the LVV-H7 level on Day 7. Previous in vitro studies indicate that the activity of cathepsin D could be potentiated by alcohol or lower pH. Nevertheless, no research has shown the changes of cathepsin D level after alcohol exposure. Hence, we evaluated the changes of cathepsin D level and pH values in plasma in this study. The basal plasma levels of cathepsin D were not significantly different among groups (between 1.01 and 1.04 ng/mL) (Fig. 3B). In the alcohol, ALLVV and ALPEP groups, the cathepsin D levels were not significantly changed throughout the experimental period. There was no significant difference among the groups at any time point. This suggests that alcohol administration and withdrawal did not alter the level of cathepsin D. In addition, neither LVV-H7 nor pepstatin co-administration affects the plasma level of cathepsin D. Taken together with previous studies; these findings suggest that alcohol exposure may increase the level of LVV-H7 through an increase of cathepsin D activity, not the quantity. Furthermore, pepstatin only blocked the potentiating effect of alcohol on cathepsin D without reducing its basal activity and level. The basal pH values (between 7.396 and 7.399) in blood were not significantly different among groups (Fig. 6C). The pH values in the control group were not significantly changed throughout the experimental period. Alcohol led to a gradual decrease to the lowest pH (7.365 ± 0.039) on Day 15. In the ALPEP group, pepstatin co-administration completely blocked alcohol-induced decrease of blood pH on Day 15. However, the blood pH returned to the basal value on Day 20 in the alcohol group. This may be due to the alcohol withdrawal from Day 15–20. Also, LVV-H7 and pepstatin co-administration did not change the blood pH on Day 20. Contrary to pepstatin, exogenous LVV-H7 co-administration did not show any effect on alcohol-induced reduction of blood pH on Day 15. This suggests that alcohol-induced reduction of blood pH may not be solely mediated through the altered level of LVV-H7. In other words, alcohol-induced reduction of blood pH might be caused by the chronic effects of alcohol."
16,Discussion,"In rats underwent chronic alcohol exposure and following withdrawal, we found the quantitative change of LVV-H7 can affect nociception. In other words, increases in LVV-H7 can trigger analgesia, whereas the decreases of LVV-H7 can cause hyperalgesia. Besides, we also found both RBC and hemoglobin counts were significantly decreased during chronic alcohol exposure. Taken together, chronic alcohol use may have a higher risk of developing anemia and subsequently reduce the level of LVV-H7, thereby leading to pain disorders, e.g. hyperalgesia. According to our results, LVV-H7 or its analogs may provide a novel strategy for pain management in patients with persistent alcohol abuse. In the tail-flick test and the hot plate test, alcohol did induce a significant decrease of pain-related response on Day 10–12 and Day 4–13 respectively. We think that these findings are comparable to AA in humans. It is known that the tail-flick test is mostly correlated with spinal nociception, whereas the hot plate test involved both supraspinal and spinal nociception [60]. Thus, the earlier time course of AA development determined by the hot plate test suggests that alcohol may induce antinociception in the brain more quickly and with longer duration via yet unknown mechanisms, as compared with its actions at the spinal level. During alcohol withdrawal, animals received alcohol showed a clear hyperalgesia effect. The latencies gradually decreased to the level below basal on Day 19–20 in the tail-flick test and Day 18–19 in the hot plate test. This suggests that AWH may recover sooner through a supraspinal mechanism in comparison with that at the spinal level. Hence, we speculate that alcohol may exert distinct effects at the supraspinal and spinal level on induction of AA and AWH. Specially, the LVV-H7 level had two distinct changes during alcohol exposure. The animals were given the same dose of alcohol during these 15 days. If alcohol affects the LVV-H7 level through only one single mechanism, the level of LVV-H7 should not have two stages with different changes. This implies that the effects of alcohol on the LVV-H7 level can be mediated through multiple mechanisms. As expected, the level of LVV-H7 was elevated following 7 days of alcohol administration. This elevation was accompanied by an analgesic effect. In search of the possible mechanism(s) underlying the effects of alcohol on the LVV-H7 level, we noticed that alcohol increased more LVV-H7 production in vitro [20]. This solvent effect may not be considered as a key factor to affect LVV-H7 production in our model because the determinations of LVV-H7 were at 4 h following alcohol administration. According to the other reports, alcohol should have been completely eliminated from the bloodstream within 4 h [57,59]. That is to say, we focused on investigating the chronic effects of alcohol on the LVV-H7 level. However, due to that alcohol can be quickly metabolized into acetaldehyde and acetic acid, the possible solvent or chemical effects of acetaldehyde and acetic acid should not be completely ruled out in further investigations. Alcohol may potentiate the activity of cathepsin D by lowering the blood pH. in vitro studies showed that the activity of cathepsin D could be enhanced at lower pH [18,19]. Thus, we examined the change in blood pH followingchronic alcohol injection. The results showed a significant drop of blood pH only in the alcohol and ALLVV groups on Day 15. However, the blood pH of both groups returned to basal levels on Day 20. Although the alcohol-induced change of blood pH may be subtle, our results indicate a significant change in the LVV-H7 level throughout the experimental period. Looking at the literatures, a previous study clearly showed that cathepsin D exhibits full activity up to pH 7.0 with 50 % activity at pH 7.5 [19]. Also, cathepsin D can be sorted to the lysosomes and found in the exosomes [61,62]. It is known that the pH in lysosomes and exosomes is more acidic than the pH in the blood. Therefore, we hypothesize that chronic alcohol exposure may be able to affect the cathepsin D activity under such a microenvironment although the change of pH is subtle in blood (Fig. 6C). Although the major mechanism underlying the effects of alcohol on LVV-H7 production is still unknown, it is likely to be mediated through an increase of cathepsin D activity, rather than an increase of cathepsin D amount in blood (Fig. 3B). Certainly, hemoglobin contents are crucial for the level of LVV-H7, as shown in our previous study on the effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids on LVV-H7. We demonstrated that hemoglobin increases can cause a significant increase in the LVV-H7 level [15]. In this study, our results showed that the reduction of the LVV-H7 level might be the consequence of the alcohol-induced hemoglobin decreases (anemia). Furthermore, we also demonstrated that the alcohol-induced hemoglobin decreases would be improved by exogenous LVV-H7 administration. However, the mechanism requires more investigations. When the raw material for LVV-H7 generation, hemoglobin, was gradually increased after a period of alcohol withdrawal, the LVV-H7 level was returned to almost the basal value (Figs. 3A and 6 B). Although alcohol may potentiate the activity of cathepsin D by lowering the blood pH to cause the LVV-H7 increase, alcohol-induced anemia could result in the decrease of raw material (hemoglobin), thereby offsetting the potentiating effect of alcohol on cathepsin D. Then, the net effect was a significant decrease in the LVV-H7 level after chronic use (2 weeks in our model) of alcohol. At the beginning of alcohol withdrawal, the activity of cathepsin D could not be activated due to any longer alcohol intervention. Besides, the alcohol-induced anemia is not recovered yet to make the raw material for LVV-H7 production to be sufficient. Hence, LVV-H7 decreases were obviously observed when compared with that at the late stage of chronic alcohol exposure. However, alcohol-induced anemia will be lessened after a few days of withdrawal. Consequently, the LVV-H7 level almost returned to the basal level at the end of the experiment. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate that the level of LVV-H7 fluctuates at different stages of alcohol exposure (before, after and during alcohol withdrawal). Furthermore, these changes are strongly associated with pain sensation, and link to acute AA and AWH. This has opened a new avenue for the study on the relationship between opioids and alcohol in basic biomedical research. The role of LVV-H7 in alcohol dependence is also highlighted. In consistent with our results, other studies also showed that the patients with AUD need larger doses of analgesics to achieve adequate analgesia [63,64]. This implied a high incidence of hyperalgesia in AUD patients, which could be resulted from a decrease of LVV-H7. Supplementation of LVV-H7 or pepstatin during alcohol use and withdrawal could be helpful to prevent and treat hyperalgesia. Although the safety in clinical use must be carefully checked, LVV-H7 and pepstatin have provided novel leads in the development of new analgesics for AUD patients, especially for solving the problem of hyperalgesia. This can also open a new avenue for novel therapeutics in the management of pain."
