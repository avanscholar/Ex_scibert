0,Introduction,"The nitrogen-containing compounds including nitrones, imines and secondary amines, etc. are versatile organic building blocks for the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals [1]. Nitrones can be used as radical spin-traps [2], antioxidants [3], and enzyme inhibitors [4] due to their spin-trapping ability. Many nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as isoxazolidines and isoxazolines, can be obtained from nitrones through 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions [5]. These heterocycles can be transformed into amino-alcohols or β-lactams [6], which are used to produce many prescribed drugs. Therefore, the development of a facile and clean method for the synthesis of valuable nitrogen-containing compounds, especially nitrone, is very important. Up to now, nitrones are commonly prepared by the following traditional synthetic routes (Fig. 1 ): (1) oxidation of imines [7] or secondary amines [8] (Route A); (2) condensation of hydroxylamines with carbonyl compounds (Route B) [9]; (3) N-alkylation of oximes (Route C) [10]; (4) a tandem process including a reduction of nitro compounds under higher H2 pressure with a subsequent condensation with aldehyde (Route D). Routes A and B consist of multistep oxidation and reduction processes, consuming a great deal of chemical reagents. Moreover, a careful control of the reaction conditions is required to obtain high selectivity. Regarding Route C, the oxime anions as an intermediate is preliminarily synthesized by the stoichiometric reaction of aldehyde with hydroxylamine hydrochloride followed by reacting with sodium hydroxide, and then the nitrone is synthesized by N-alkylation [10]. The above multistep processes (Routes A-C) would lead to a high production cost and a heavy environmental pollution. In a direct and green approach, nitrone can be obtained by one-pot reaction from nitro compounds and aldehydes (Route D). Cisneros et al. [11] and Li et al. [12] successfully prepared nitrone from nitro compounds and aldehydes over Pt/C and Pt/MOF under 5–34 bar of high H2 pressure, in which the tandem process circumvents the unstable hydroxylamine storage issues and also simplifies synthetic step. However, the noble metal Pt and harsh reaction conditions (high H2 pressure) are required. The Pt/MOF system is only applicable for conversion of nitromethane [12]. Moreover, the deep reduction of reactants, intermediates and products depresses the selectivity to nitrone. Thus the large-scale industrial application is limited. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a facile and practical method to synthesize nitrone. Heterogeneous photocatalysis has been considered as one of the most promising alternatives for selective synthesis of organic chemicals [13]. From references [14], alcohols can not only serve as substrate to be oxidized to aldehyde by photogenerated holes, but also provide hydrogen for reduction reactions. Nitro compounds can be transformed into amines by photoinduced electrons through the intermediates including hydroxylamines and nitroso compounds [15]. If both photooxidation and photoreduction simultaneously take place in a same reaction system, the two half-reactions can be remarkably promoted each other owing to the efficient recombination inhibition of photoinduced charge carriers [16]. Moreover, from Route B, we know that nitrone can be prepared via condensation of hydroxylamine with aldehyde. Therefore, we envisaged the nitrone might be synthesized from nitro compound and alcohol through a facile visible-light-mediated one-pot strategy over low-cost CdS photocatalyst (Route E). The as-formed hydroxylamines from nitro compounds directly react with the as-produced aldehydes from alcohols to produce nitrones. The proposed approach not only takes over the merits of Route D, but also avoids the use of high H2 pressure and noble metals that definitely required in Route D. In addition, benzyl alcohol is used to replace benzaldehyde, which further simplifies the reaction step and also reduces cost. More importantly, the proposed Route E can also overcome the shortcomings of Route D regarding the deep reduction of the reactants, intermediate and products under high H2 pressure, which hopefully allows us to obtain high selectivity to nitrone. In order to realize the proposed Route E, to efficiently control reduction of nitrobenzene to hydroxylamine is the key for a facile, low-cost and sustainable production of nitrone. Till now, only amines and imines can been obtained by light-driven one-pot synthesis from nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol because of the difficulty of precisely controlling reduction degree of nitrobenzene to hydroxylamine [17]. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report regarding the photocatalytic synthesis of phenylhydroxylamine, not to mention one-pot synthesis of nitrones from nitro compound and alcohol. Furthermore, the relationship between selectivity of the production (imines or secondary amines) and the nature of catalyst remains unclear. Herein, for the first time, we report a facile visible-light-initiated one-pot strategy for efficient synthesis of nitrone with 91% selectivity at 77% conversion after only 25 min of illumination by visible light (89% selectivity at 91% conversion, 30 min) by using nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol as starting reactants. This method integrates the controlled photocatalytic reduction of nitrobenzene to phenylhydroxylamine by photoinduced electrons over a low-cost CdS photocatalyst with a suitable reduction capability and the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde by photogenerated holes, followed by a spontaneous condensation of the as-formed phenylhydroxylamine and benzaldehyde. Both photocatalyzed reduction and oxidation half-reactions can be efficiently promoted each other owing to the efficient recombination inhibition of photogenerated charge carriers. In addition, by tuning cocatalyst and illumination time, for the conversion of the same reactants, the other two versatile nitrogen-containing intermediates, imine and secondary amine, have been successfully synthesized. Finally, the tentative reaction mechanisms for flexible synthesis of the three target products by the developed visibly-light-initiated one-pot synthetic strategy are proposed. This work not only presents a novel and efficient method for a facile synthesis of nitrone, but also reveals the relationship between the properties of different CdS-based catalysts and the selectivity to nitrone, imine and secondary amine."

8,Results and discussion,
9,Preparation and characterization of CdS based photocatalysts,"3.1 Preparation and characterization of CdS based photocatalysts CdS nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by a previously reported solvothermal method with some modifications [18]. The MoS2 or Ni co-catalyst was deposited on the surface of CdS NPs to prepare MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS by hydrothermal and photodeposition methods, respectively [19,14a]. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the CdS, MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS are shown in Fig. 2 . The CdS features irregular nanoparticles with the size from 30 nm to 140 nm, and there is no significant effect on the morphology and size of CdS NPs when decorated MoS2 and Ni. Moreover, the photographs (inset in Fig. 2) of CdS, MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS feature the orange color for CdS NPs, while the MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS show palm green and yellow green nanoparticles, respectively. This indicates that the MoS2 and Ni have been successfully decorated on CdS NPs. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 3 ) confirm a mixture of cubic (PDF#65-2887) and hexagonal (PDF#41-1049) phases of CdS NPs. There is not visible diffraction peak towards molybdenum sulfide or Ni species on MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS to be resolved, ascribed to the low loading and/or small size. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of CdS, MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS are shown in Figs. 4–6 . The Mo 3d spectrum can be fitted into two subsets of peaks at 228.2 and 231.7 eV attributed to Mo4+, and at 232.7 and 235.4 eV ascribed to Mo6+. The Mo4+ was found to be the dominant oxidation state, and the existed Mo6+ can be ascribed to exposure to air [20]). From Ni 2p spectrum in Fig. 6d, the peak appearing at 852.2 eV is assigned to metallic Ni, and at 856.0 eV ascribed to NiO. The existence of NiO originates from the oxidation of the deposited Ni while the catalyst is exposed to air [14a]. The surface area of CdS NPs, MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS are 16.1 m2 g−1, 16.5 m2 g−1 and 14.5 m2 g−1, respectively (Fig. 7 ), further showing no obvious change in the CdS structure after loading MoS2 or Ni cocatalysts. The photocatalysis is strongly dependent on light absorption capacity and the charge-carriers separation efficiency, mainly affected by the energy band structure of photocatalyst. Furthermore, the position of valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of a photocatalyst determines its oxidation and reduction capability, which is crucial to the product distribution of photocatalytic organic reactions. The band gap and the positions of VB and CB were determined by combining UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and VB-XPS (Fig. 8 ). The UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 8a) indicate the increased visible light absorption with a wide absorption tail if MoS2 or Ni (NiOx) is loaded on CdS NPs. The corresponding Tauc plots coming from the UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra are shown in Fig. 8a (inset), and the band gaps of CdS, MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS are 2.28, 2.23 and 2.26 eV, respectively. Based on XPS valence band spectra (Fig. 8b), the top of VB of CdS, MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS are 1.35, 1.06 and 1.10 eV vs. EF (the potential of the Fermi level), respectively. The Fermi levels of CdS, MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS are obtained from Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. S1) are −0.44, −0.48 and −0.57 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively. The top of VB of CdS, MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS are calculated to be 1.79, 1.51 and 1.67 eV vs. RHE [21]. Fig. 8c displays the electronic band structure of CdS, MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS. The CB of CdS is −0.49 eV. MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS indicate a more negative CB by 0.2 eV and 0.1 eV than that of CdS, respectively. This implies that CdS has a relatively low reduction capability [19]. On the other hand, CdS shows higher VB than MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS by 0.25 and 0.12 eV, respectively, which endows CdS with higher oxidation capability than the other two photocatalysts. The relatively low reduction capability makes it possible for CdS to controllably reduce nitrobenzene to phenylhydroxylamine by photogenerated electrons. As a result, the proposed visible-light-initiated one-pot method (Route E in Fig. 1) can be realized."
10,Photocatalytic properties for nitrone clean synthesis,"3.2 Photocatalytic properties for nitrone clean synthesis Based on the results of controlled experiments, both imine and nitrone can be formed by the spontaneous condensation of benzaldehyde with aniline (Fig. S2) and phenylhydroxylamine (Figs. S3 and S4) at ambient pressure and room temperature, respectively. However, nitrosobenzene cannot react with benzaldehyde (Fig. S5). Therefore, to controllably obtain phenylhydroxylamine without further reduction to aniline is a key for the synthesis of nitrone with high selectivity. With respect to the proposed Route E for nitrone synthesis, we design a one-pot two-stage process: one is photocatalytic stage containing the controlled reduction of nitrobenzene to phenylhydroxylamine and the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde; the other is the spontaneous condensation between the as-formed phenylhydroxylamine and benzaldehyde. Fig. S6 further confirms that the designed one-pot two-stage process works well, and the as-formed phenylhydroxylamine at the 1st stage gradually decreases while the desired nitrone gradually increases when the reaction mixture stands for 2 h. By using nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol as reactants, the reaction properties of CdS, MoS2/CdS and Ni/CdS photocatalysts for nitrone synthesis via one-pot two-stage approach were tested. Table S1 summarizes the photocatalytic results for diverse illumination times, and the results for the combined photocatalytic process and subsequent condensation is presented in Table 1 . Fig. S7 shows the time-dependent change in the amounts of products and no visible change in products distribution if the standing time reaches up to 8 h. In order to make sure the complete condensation, we stand the photocatalytic reaction mixture more than 12 h. To our delight, the results verify the flexible synthesis of nitrone, imine, and secondary amine from nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol over the low-cost CdS-based photocatalysts by tuning cocatalyst and illumination time. The blank experiments (Table S1 and 1, entry 5,6,11,12,18,19) reveal only negligible transformation of nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol. Interestingly, in combination of the photocatalytic process over bare CdS NPs and the subsequently spontaneous condensation process, nitrone is successfully synthesized. However, only trace nitrone is obtained in the absence of subsequent condensation process (entry 1,2 in Table S1). The extension of illumination time heightens the conversion of nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol, but it depresses the selectivity to nitrone (Table 1, entry 1–4). Thanks to the suitable reduction capability of CdS photocatalyst and the efficient inhibition of recombination of photogenerated charge carriers by the integrating effect of the simultaneous photoreduction of nitrobenzene and photooxidation of benzyl alcohol half-reactions, the 91% selectivity to nitrone at 77% conversion (89% selectivity at 91% conversion) is obtained after only 25–30 min of illumination by visible light (Table 1, entry 1,2). In a word, we develop a facile visible-light-initiated one-pot strategy for efficient synthesis of nitrone at ambient pressure and room temperature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on efficient synthesis of nitrone from nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol. This discovery presents a practical method for the industrial production of nitrone, a versatile intermediate. In order to obtain functionalized nitrones, the substituted nitrobenzenes were used as reaction substrates to replace the nitrobenzene, and the results are listed in Table S2. It can be found that the developed strategy regarding nitrone synthesis can be extended to the substituted nitrobenzenes with diverse methyl, chloro, and methoxyl groups. However, if the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups substituted nitrobenzenes as substrates, only the corresponding imines can be obtained, owing to the amines being formed but not hydroxylamine. It was established that the submitted benzyl alcohols could be easily oxidized to benzaldehydes. Therefore, it can be safely say that a series of submitted nitrones can be obtained by our developed strategy by using the selected substituted nitrobenzenes with diverse substituted benzyl alcohols as starting materials. It is of great significance to elucidate the reaction mechanism behind the developed visible-light-initiated one-pot strategy for efficient synthesis of nitrone. On the basis of the aforementioned controlled experiments (Fig. S3-6) and the reactions results (entry 1–6 in Tables 1 and S1), a tentative mechanism is proposed as depicted in Fig. 9 . Upon illumination, the photoinduced electrons in VB migrate to CB, which leaves the equal photoinduced holes in VB. Then, benzyl alcohol is oxidized to form benzaldehyde and to release H+ by the holes. At the same time, nitrobenzene is reduced to nitrosobenzene by the photogenerated electrons, and then further hydrogenated to phenylhydroxylamine by the electrons and H+. Finally, nitrone can be obtained by the spontaneous condensation reaction (no light, no catalyst) of the as-formed phenylhydroxylamine with benzaldehyde at ambient pressure and room temperature (Fig. S3,4,6) [9]. The controlled reduction of nitrobenzene to phenylhydroxylamine but not to aniline by combining suitable reduction capability of CdS and illumination time is crucial to the selective synthesis of nitrone."
11,Imine and secondary amine from nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol,"3.3 Imine and secondary amine from nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol It can be clearly observed that the main product is imine but not nitrone over MoS2/CdS photocatalyst even at a low conversion of nitrobenzene (Table 1, entry 7,8), ascribed to the deep reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline owing to more negative CB potential of MoS2/CdS than that of CdS that comes from the introduction of MoS2. The selectivity to imine increases gradually with the extension of illumination time, and up to 95% at 100% of nitrobenzene conversion after 6 h of illumination by visible light (Table 1, entry 10). The 6 h for photocatalytic process is long enough for the subsequent condensation of the as-formed aniline with benzaldehyde, confirmed by the similar results with and without subsequent standing period after photocatalytic reaction (entry 10 in Tables 1 and S1). The developed process for imine synthesis in this work eliminates the required non-polar solvent like toluene and cyclohexane in the previous reports [17a,b], since benzyl alcohol serves as both reactant and solvent. The influence of amount of MoS2 decorated on CdS on the selectivity of imine (shown in Fig. S8) was also studied, and the highest selectivity was obtained when the optimized theoretical weight ratio of MoS2 was 5 wt%. The proposed mechanism for imine evolution over MoS2/CdS is illustrated in Fig. 10 , similar to the previously reported process over different photocatalysts [17a,b]. Upon illumination, the photo-excited electrons in VB move to CB and leave the equal amount of photo-excited holes. Then, benzyl alcohol is oxidized to benzaldehyde and release H+ by the holes. Simultaneously, nitrobenzene is reduced to nitrosobenzene and phenylhydroxylamine, and ultimately hydrogenated to amine by the electrons and H+. Finally, imine can be obtained by condensation amine and benzaldehyde. The as-formed nitrone can be photoreduced to imine under visible light irradiation. Distinct from CdS and MoS2/CdS, using Ni/CdS as photocatalyst, the photocatalytic reaction mixture mainly consists of condensation products including nitrone, imine, and secondary amine. No obvious change in the reaction results for the process including the subsequent condensation or not can be observed Ni/CdS photocatalyst while illumination time is not less than 1 h (Table S1 and 1, entry 13–17), suggesting the complete condensation in the photocatalytic reaction process. With the increase in the illumination time, nitrone gradually decreases and then disappears after 3 h of illumination time, while imine increases and reaches the maximum at 1 h of illumination time and then decreases along with an increase in secondary amine. The 57% selectivity to secondary amine (the left is mainly imine) at 100% nitrobenzene conversion can be obtained after 4 h of illumination time (Table 1, entry 15). We also studied the influence of amount of Ni decorated on CdS on the selectivity of secondary amine (shown in Fig. S9), and the highest selectivity was obtained when the optimized theoretical weight ratio of Ni was 3.5 wt%. This approach for visible-light photocatalytic secondary amine production over Ni/CdS shows its advantages in contrast to the previously reported methods regarding the elimination of the required noble metals and UV light [17c,d]. The further hydrogenation of imine to secondary amine over Ni/CdS cannot be ascribed to the higher reduction capability owing to its lower reduction capability than that of MoS2/CdS. Controlled experiments were performed to understand the origin of the promoted formation of secondary amine over Ni/CdS photocatalyst. Besides the comparable catalytic performance for the reduction of imine to secondary amine can be obtained in the absence and presence of the added H2 (Table S3, entry 2,3), we can find that the yield of secondary amine over Ni/CdS is much higher than that over MoS2/CdS or CdS under either H2 atmosphere (Table S3, entry 2,6) or nitrogen atmosphere (Table S3, entry 3,7). This implies that the reduction of imine to secondary amine over Ni/CdS doesn’t result from the released H2 from benzyl alcohol. Even if extra H2 was introduced, imine still cannot be converted into secondary amine while acetonitrile acted as solvent to replace benzyl alcohol, suggesting the further reduction of imine to secondary amine by the Ni-H hydrids that comes from the reduction of the adsorbed alcohol on the Ni species by photogenerated electrons. Based on the above controlled experiments, a tentative mechanism is proposed as presented in Fig. 11 . Initially, benzyl alcohol can be absorbed on the surface of Ni particles. When CdS is illuminated, the photo-excited electrons in VB will move to CB and leave equal amount of holes, and the electron is localized from CdS to the deposited Ni NPs. A proton from benzyl alcohol absorbed on Ni surface is reduced by electron, resulting in a Ni-H hydrid and an alkoxide anion. Subsequently, this alkoxide anion is oxidized by the hole, and the Ni-assisted homolytic cleavage of α-C-H occurs, affording another Ni-H hydrids and the corresponding aldehyde [17c,d]. A part of Ni-H hydrids and electrons are used to reduce nitrobenzene to aniline and reduce imine to secondary amine and the left Ni-H hydrides are used to release H2."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, we for the first time realize the visible-light- initiated one-pot synthesis of nitrone from nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol under ambient pressure and room temperature conditions. Thanks to the suitable reduction capability of CdS photocatalyst and efficient inhibition of recombination of photogenerated charge carriers by the integrating effect of the spontaneous photoreduction of nitrobenzene and photooxidation of benzyl alcohol half-reactions, 91% selectivity to nitrone at 77% conversion (89% selectivity at 91% conversion) has been achieved after only 25–30 min of illumination by visible light. Furthermore, by tuning cocatalyst and illumination time, for the conversion of the same reactants, the other two useful nitrogen-containing compounds including imine and secondary amine have been successfully synthesized. The tentative reaction mechanisms for flexible synthesis of the three target products are proposed. In addition, the relationship between the properties of different CdS-based catalysts and the selectivity of nitrone, imine and secondary amine has been revealed. This work not only presents a new and efficient method for the synthesis of nitrone, but also opens a new avenue for a facile one-pot synthesis of the other chemicals."
