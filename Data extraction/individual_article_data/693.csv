0,Introduction,"Alcohols have been identified by many research groups, including the U.S. Department of Energy Co-Optima Initiative [1], as advantageous blendstocks for gasoline fuels towards enabling cleaner and more efficient internal combustion engines, including conventional spark-ignition (SI) and compression-ignition (CI) engines, and advanced combustion concepts such as spark-assisted compression ignition engines. Compared to conventional hydrocarbons of similar chain length, alcohols possess unique chemical and physical characteristics due to the hydroxyl moiety, including liquid state at room temperature suitable for transportation use, increased solubility allowing for higher blending ratios with gasoline and diesel, and increased fuel-based oxygen during combustion potentially reducing CO and particulate matter emissions. Alcohols also have the advantage of being derivable from renewable biological sources. Among all the attractive alcohols, ethanol already has a long history in application to the automobile industry, e.g., E100 in Brazil and E10 gasoline in U.S.A [2]. Despite ethanol's widespread use in gasoline, there are also technical and economical disadvantages associated with it, such as a low energy density compared to typical gasoline fuels (i.e., 21.4 MJ/L for ethanol vs. 30–33 MJ/L for gasoline fuels [3]). The use of heavier alcohols with longer carbon chain are beneficial in this regard, since larger alcohols are generally more energy dense [3]. Although many heavier alcohols are available and can be directly blended with petroleum-derived gasolines, C3–C4 alcohols are more suitable for used as gasoline fuels since alcohols containing five or more carbon atoms are less effective at improving knock resistance in SI engines. Experimental measurements quantifying the performance of C3–C4 alcohol/gasoline blends in engine test facilities are scarce. SI engine test campaigns were conducted by Gong et al. [4], Sivasubramanian et al. [5], and Kumar et al. [6] for propanol/gasoline blends and by Godwin et al. [7] and Agbro et al. [8] for gasoline blended with n-butanol and iso-butanol. These studies reported that blending C3–C4 iso-alcohols into gasoline leads to improvement in thermal efficiency, and carbon dioxide and unburned hydrocarbons emissions, while increases NOx emissions. Investigations in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine have also been carried out by Lu et al. [9] for iso-propanol/n-heptane blends, by Saisirirat et al. [10] and Zhang and Boehman [11] for n-butanol/n-heptane blends, and by Kalaskar et al. [12] for iso-butanol/PRF (primary reference fuel, blends of iso-octane and n-heptane) blends. Heat release analysis was also performed in these studies, where C3–C4 alcohol blending was found to suppress low-temperature heat release (LTHR) and delay the onset of main ignition. Measurements of autoignition and oxidation characteristics in fundamental reactors for C3–C4 alcohol/gasoline blends are also significantly lacking, though some studies can be found for C3–C4 neat alcohols in two jet-stirred reactors [13,14], a low-pressure flow reactor [15], a shock tube [16] and a few rapid compression machines (RCM) [3,14,17-20]. To date, there are only a few studies available for blends of C3–C4 alcohols and gasoline or gasoline surrogates. Kumar et al. [21] studied the influence of n-butanol blending on the two-stage ignition characteristics of PRF fuels in an RCM at a compressed pressure of 20 bar, and compressed temperatures from 613 K to 979 K. The blending effects of n-butanol on preliminary heat release characteristics (e.g., LTHR) were, however, not evaluated, although discernable from measured pressure-time histories. Tomlin and co-workers investigated the blending effects of n-butanol [22] and iso-butanol [23] on the autoignition and LTHR characteristics of a reference gasoline and gasoline surrogates in an RCM at φ = 1, compressed pressure of 20 bar and low to intermediate temperatures. Their works highlighted the significance of LTHR in affecting overall fuel ignition reactivity, and revealed the complicated perturbative effects of butanol isomers on LTHR characteristics. All the studies investigating C3–C4 alcohol blending effects on preliminary heat release characteristics of gasoline fuels (or gasoline surrogates) focused on LTHR only, while blending effects on intermediate temperature heat release (ITHR) remain unclear. ITHR has already been demonstrated to be important by several groups. Messerly et al. [24] and Pintor et al. [25] found that ITHR is strongly correlated to φ-sensitivity, a fuel property characterized by the sensitivity of fuel reactivity to variations in fuel concentration within a mixture. High φ-sensitive fuels are thought to be desirable for engine operations under stratified charging scenarios, since the combustion duration can be significantly extended via the so-called sequential autoignition process, thus reducing peak pressure rise rates during the combustion process and allowing engine operation at higher loads [26]. Cheng et al. [27] also identified strong correlations between ITHR and autoignition reactivity in a recent study, where they characterized the blending effect of ethanol on the extent and evolution of ITHR for a five-component gasoline surrogate in an RCM at advanced engine-relevant conditions (i.e., 40 bar, 750 and 900 K, and a diluted/stoichiometric fuel loading), and 10, 20 and 30 vol% ethanol blending levels. Extent of ITHR was defined as the accumulated heat release, while evolution of ITHR was defined as the time taken for the process to occur (c.f. Fig. 1 ). The strong correlation between ITHR and autoignition reactivity was also confirmed by Boehman and co-workers [28] in an HCCI engine at conditions where LTHR is completely suppressed. Combustion phasing comparisons was carried out, and it was found that ITHR significantly affects fuel autoignition reactivity. Furthermore, ITHR has also been found to determine octane sensitivity [28,29] (the absolute difference between research octane number (RON) [30] and motor octane number (MON) [31], denoted as OS), which is an important fuel property for engine operation under boosted/low-temperature conditions. Characterization of the impact of C3–C4 alcohols on gasoline ITHR characteristics is needed, to facilitate quantitative prediction of fuel behavior under both conventional and advanced engine operation strategies. To address these needs, the current work employs an RCM to investigate the blending effects of C3–C4 iso-alcohols (namely iso-propanol and iso-butanol) on the ITHR characteristics of a research-grade gasoline, Fuel for Advanced Combustion Engines F (FACE-F), at a diluted/stoichiometric fuel loading, compressed pressure of Pc = 43 bar, and temperatures of Tc = 700–970 K. iso-Alcohols are selected because they are superior to their linear counterparts in boosting OS. Alcohol blending effects are studied by adding 10, 20 and 30 vol% iso-alcohol into the base gasoline. A recently developed, multi-component gasoline surrogate model from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) [32] is also used to model the RCM experiments and perform numerical analyses to interpret the fundamental chemistry governing the iso-alcohol blending effects on ITHR characteristics."
1,Experimental,"The experiments used in this study have been previously reported in [33], but only in the form of ignition delay times, while this study conducts new and more comprehensive analyses to characterize the change in ITHR behavior across different iso-alcohol blending levels. These experiments were acquired in the heated, twin-piston RCM (tpRCM) at Argonne National Laboratory. Readers are encouraged to find detailed descriptions of the configuration of the tpRCM and the associated experimental uncertainties in [33-35], which are briefly described here. The tpRCM is pneumatically-driven and hydraulically controlled. A ring-groove arrangement in the hydraulic chambers is used at the end of the stroke to facilitate deceleration, while the hydraulic chambers are pressurized during the test period to minimize piston rebound at ignition. The pistons in the reaction chamber incorporate crevices machined around their circumference to suppress vorticular motion during and post compression. The exterior of the reaction chamber is heated using band, tape and cartridge heaters, with high-density insulation fitted between the flanges of the cylinders and the hydraulic chambers. Thermal uniformity of ±0.2% is achieved in the axial and azimuthal directions across the interior and exterior surfaces. The dynamic pressure is measured using a Kistler 6045A-U20 transducer, regularly calibrated to 250 bar, and coupled to a Kistler 5064 charge amplifier. The 6045A-U20 is designed for thermal shock resistance (< ±1%) and incorporates a reinforced diaphragm for knock protection. The signal can be split and simultaneously recorded with two data acquisition cards (NI 9239 (24-bit/50kHz); NI 9223 (16-bit/1000kHz)) to adequately resolve both low- and high-temperature heat release processes. A Savitzky-Golay algorithm with 2nd-order fit is applied to condition the recorded signals with a window of 0.3 ms. A 5.6 L stainless steel tank, heated to ~70 °C, is used to prepare fuel/O2/diluent mixtures. Liquid fuel at room temperature is first injected into the evacuated tank via syringe through a septum, or added in gaseous phase, with high purity gases subsequently delivered through a small port. The gas addition induces significant turbulent mixing, and then the charge is allowed to diffusively blend for a minimum of 45 min before testing; longer wait times show little/no influence on the measurements. The evaporation efficiency of the fuels is calculated from ideal gas relationships, with ~95% typically achieved. The mass of injected fuel, and partial pressures of the gaseous components are used to determine the molar compositions of the mixtures. The compressed temperatures (Tc), first-stage and main ignition times (τ1 and τ, respectively), and HRRs are determined via post-processing recorded pressure traces. Equivalent non-reacting tests are performed where O2 is replaced by N2 due to their similar thermophysical properties. The pressure traces are aligned at 80–90% of the pressure rise, with end of compression specified by the peak in the non-reacting trace. The non-reactive tests are also used to derive effective volume-time histories for chemical kinetic modeling where rates of compression heating, and heat loss induced pressure/temperature decay during the induction period are empirically taken into account. FACE-F is selected as the base gasoline for this work. It is a research-grade gasoline with consistent composition. The use of research-grade gasoline is beneficial to establish quantitative comparison across various research groups, which is challenging with commercial gasolines due to their compositional complexity and variability. Detailed chemical and physical properties of FACE-F can be found in [36] and have been well documented in recent studies from KAUST [37-39]. It is a mid-octane fuel with an anti-knock index (AKI) of 91.6, which consists of relatively lower fractions of n-paraffinic and aromatics but higher fractions of naphthenes and olefins as compared to other FACE gasolines. According to the Detailed Hydrocarbon Analysis of FACE-F, major components of n- Paraffins, Iso- paraffins, Olefins, Naphthenes and Aromatics (PIONA) are n-heptane (C7), iso-octane (C8), 1-hexene (C6), cyclopentane (C5), and mixtures of ethylbenzene and xylenes (C8), respectively. Table 1 lists the PIONA distribution for FACE-F, and Table 2 summarizes the key properties of FACE-F. In this study, iso-alcohol-blended gasolines are prepared by adding 10, 20 and 30 liquid volume percent of iso-alcohol (anhydrous, ≥ 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) into FACE-F (provided by Prof. Mani Sarathy at KAUST who obtained FACE-F from the Conoco Phillips Chemical Company [38]), designated at P10, P20 and P30 for FACE-F/iso-propanol blends, and B10, B20 and B30 for FACE-F/iso-butanol blends. A fixed diluted/stoichiometric fuel loading (15% O2, ϕ =1) and constant compressed pressure (Pc = 43 bar) are studied in this work, which is representative of boosted SI engine operation under elevated EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) scenarios. Two diluent mixtures are adopted in order to cover low- to intermediate-temperature regimes. The test conditions used in this study are summarized in Table 3 ."

3,3.1. FACE-F surrogate,"3.1 3.1. FACE-F surrogate This study utilizes a 5-component surrogate for FACE-F to assist kinetic modeling of the autoignition process. Detailed philosophies of developing the surrogate blend, including selection of appropriate target properties and corresponding surrogate mixtures can be found in [38,40], hence only key features of the proposed surrogate are described here. Instead of using simpler surrogates, such as a PRF or three-component, toluene primary reference fuels (TPRF), an array of constituents is utilized here and is beneficial to match octane qualities, as well as features such as a fuel's distillation curve [41]. Previous work [40] numerically formulated a five-component surrogate for FACE-F (FGF-LLNL) with each component selected from five structural families where carbon type, molar H/C ratio, AKI and octane sensitivity (S) were the target properties selected. Two correlations were utilized to estimate AKI and S: first, between homogeneous gas-phase ignition delay times at 825 K and 25 atm and AKI; and second, between the minimum slope of the NTC region and S. Previous studies have demonstrated that in addition to the standardized properties used to formulate FGF-LLNL (e.g., RON, MON and S), FGF-LLNL also reasonably captures the ethanol blending effects on heat release and autoignition characteristics of FACE-F [32,34]. The compositional makeup and several target properties of FGF-LLNL are compared to FACE-F in Tables 1 and 2, respectively."
4,Gasoline surrogate and iso-alcohol chemistry model,"3.2 Gasoline surrogate and iso-alcohol chemistry model The gasoline surrogate chemistry model developed by LLNL is used in this study [32]. It is developed based on the “core” C0–C4 sub-model developed by National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG) [42], with reaction rate rules and thermochemistry significantly updated for typical PIONA components. Details of the updates with respect to the PIONA components can be found in [32]. The alcohol chemistry model is taken from [43], where the low- to intermediate-temperatures were significantly updated following recent studies. Details regarding the updates implemented to the alcohol sub-chemistries and validation against experiments can be found in [43] and [3], respectively. The combined chemistry model can be found in the Supplementary Material in [32], where the model also covers sub-chemistries for FGF-KAUST (another multi-component surrogate for FACE-F) [32] and ethanol [3]. 3.2.1 ZeroRK Simulations of the RCM ignition delay times are completed using the LLNL-developed fast solver ZeroRK [44], including volume-time histories derived from non-reactive tests accounting for compression and heat loss. The non-reactive volume-time histories are provided in the Supplementary Material, with their filenames corresponding to column AE in the summary experimental spreadsheet in the Supplementary Material."
5,Data analysis,"The compressed temperature, ignition delay times and heat release rates are determined by post-processing recorded pressure traces. In order to ascertain the end of compression (t0) and the extent of the heat loss during ignition delay period, a non-reactive test, wherein O2 in the test mixture is replaced with N2, is conducted for each reactive case. The compressed temperatures are calculated using the adiabatic core hypothesis, (1) ∫ T i T c γ γ − 1 d T T = l n P c P i where the subscripts ‘ i ’ and ‘ c ’ indicate initial and compressed conditions, while γ is the ratio of specific heat of the gas mixture. The ideal gas law is applied over all the experimental conditions including pre- and post-compression, and the specific heat of the gas is taken to be a function of the initial mixture composition as well as the individual specific heat of the gas constituents. The specific heat of each gas constituent is estimated from polynomial fits of published data and as a function of temperature. An energy balance approach [45] is used to calculate the heat release rates (HRR), and accumulated, or integrated heat release. The volumetric compression, and the accompanying heat loss and crevice flow processes are also incorporated into the analysis with the measured non-reacting pressure traces. This can be expressed as, (2) H R R = γ γ − 1 d V d t [ P − P n r ] + 1 γ − 1 V [ d P d t − d P d t | n r ] − p V ( γ − 1 ) 2 [ d γ d t − d γ d t | n r ] where the subscript ‘ n r ’ indicates non-reacting condition. The gas temperature during the reactive tests is calculated using: (3) T ≈ T n r + x b ( L H V m i x / c v ) where L H V m i x is the lower heating value of the mixture, c v is the constant-volume specific heat of the mixture, and x b is the fraction of fuel energy released, which can be deduced from ∫ ( H R R ) d t / L H V m i x . The non-reactive temperature is determined via ln ( T u / T i ) = ∫ ( γ − 1 ) / γ ( 1 / P n r ) ( d P n r / d t ) d t . It should be noted that the method used for computing HRR does not take into account the exothermically-induced energy loses, e.g., enhanced heat transfer to the walls and gas transfer to the crevice in the reactive tests in comparison to the respective non-reactive test. Figure 1 presents a representative reactive trace along with the associated non-reactive trace for a ‘neat’ FACE-F case, where alignment between the non-reactive and reactive traces prior to heat release events is excellent. Ignition delay times for first-stage ( τ 1 , defined as the time from the end of compression determined from non-reactive test to the time of max pressure rise rate during first-stage ignition) and main ignition ( τ , defined as the time from the end of compression determined from non-reactive test to the time of max pressure rise rate during main ignition) are also highlighted in Fig. 1, along with the start and end of intermediate temperature heat release (denoted as soITHR and eoITHR, respectively) inferred from the HRR trajectory, which are demarcated using d H R R / d t = 0 and H R R ∼ 0.1 / m s , respectively, according to the definitions from [46]. ITHR is characterized using two parameters: 1) the extent of ITHR, defined as the integral of heat release from soITHR to eoITHR, i.e., ∫ s o I T H R e o I T H R H H R d t , and 2) the evolution of ITHR, defined as the ratio of the time from soITHR to eoITHR (t1) to the time from soITHR to main ignition (t2), i.e., t1/t2. Note that all heat release calculations presented in this work are normalized by the LHV of the test mixture, e.g., (J/mol/ms)/(J/mol). Uncertainty analyses associated with ANL's tpRCM were presented in [47,48], using a linear propagation approach similar to [49]. The uncertainty in computed Tc is estimated at 1.0–1.5%, due to instrumentation imprecision and procedural uncertainties associated with mixture preparation. It is important to recognize that quantifying the impact of Tc’s uncertainty on accumulated heat release is not straightforward due to the probability distribution of Tc within its uncertainty, interplay between Tc and other parameters given highly non-linear relations between Tc and heat release rate, etc. Established frameworks of uncertainty quantification, such as [35,50], can be adopted for such evaluation in the future, but is beyond the scope of this study. The uncertainty in calculation of heat release due to measurement uncertainties is estimated at ±6–7%, as discussed in the Supplementary Material (Figs. S1 and S2) and [48,51]. This does not take into account systematic uncertainties associated with the calculation framework that employs the single-zone formulation and the application of adiabatic core hypothesis, which cannot account for exothermically-driven heat loss and gas transport to the piston crevice volumes, though some estimates are provided in the Supplementary Material. The uncertainty of t1/t2 is estimated at ±1–2%, which originates from the variation in time corresponding to ±7% change in HRR at eoITHR."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Blending effects on ITHR,"5.1 Blending effects on ITHR 5.1.1 iso-Propanol Figure 2 first presents the iso-propanol blending effects on ITHR characteristics at two representative temperatures (i.e., Tc = 750 and 900 K), where the measured and simulated extent and evolution of ITHR, as defined with Fig. 1, are presented as functions of iso-propanol content. Here ITHR extent is presented as percent of total fuel energy (i.e., %LHV). For ITHR evolution, an increase in t1/t2 indicates a decelerated transition through ITHR to HTHR, meaning that it takes longer for HTHR to be achieved. The experimental results in Fig. 2a show that iso-propanol promotes the extent of ITHR at both Tc = 750 and 900 K, with greater promoting effect seen at Tc = 750 K. The promoting effect at both temperatures appears to be non-linear, with peak perturbation consistently observed at 30 vol% iso-propanol blending, accounting for over 7.0% and 5.0% of total fuel energy at Tc = 750 and 900 K, respectively. On the other hand, Fig. 2b shows that iso-propanol considerably suppresses the evolution of ITHR (i.e., leading to greater t1/t2) at Tc = 750 K, while there is negligible impact at Tc = 900 K, where ITHR accounts for ~97% of the ignition process regardless of iso-propanol blending level. The model, in conjunction with the 5-component surrogate (FGF-LLNL), captures the qualitative the experimental trends reasonably well, including the promoting effect on ITHR extent at both temperatures, the decelerating effect on ITHR evolution at Tc = 750 K, and the stronger perturbative effects at Tc = 750 K than at Tc = 900 K. Quantitative discrepancies are also seen in Fig. 2a, where the model over-predicts the ITHR extent at low levels of iso-propanol blending, particularly at Tc = 750 K. Figure 3 next summarizes the extent (Fig. 3a) and evolution (Fig. 3b) of ITHR for FACE-F/P0–P30 blends as functions of inverse temperature at Pc = 43 bar and wider range of Tc’s than Fig. 2. First seen for all the fuels is the unique temperature dependence of ITHR characteristics, and the correspondence between ITHR extent and evolution where greater ITHR extent typically correlates with longer duration of ITHR (i.e., greater t1/t2). Both ITHR extent and t1/t2 peak at the intersect temperature, i.e., Tc ~ 830 K, between the low- and intermediate-temperature regimes. Below this temperature, temperature promotes the extent of ITHR and extends the evolution of ITHR, whereas above this temperature, opposite trends are evident. iso-Propanol blending effects on ITHR characteristics are also significantly different between these two temperature regimes. Specifically, within the low-temperature regime, iso-propanol enhances the extent of ITHR and decelerates the evolution of ITHR, with larger perturbative effects seemingly exhibiting at Tc ~ 750 K, while within the intermediate-temperature regime when LTHR is completely suppressed, the blending effects on ITHR diminishes greatly, with nearly no perturbation observed at the highest temperature studied. The somewhat non-linear blending effects previously observed in Fig. 2 are also displayed here across a wider range of temperature conditions. It should be noted that two-stage ignition behavior and LTHR is observed at Tc < 830 K, while at Tc > 830 K, LTHR is completely suppressed for all the test fuels [33]. The different temperature dependences and iso-propanol blending effects for both ITHR extent and evolution with and without LTHR indicate that LTHR can considerably affect ensuing heat release characteristics and overall combustion duration, and this has also been corroborated by previous studies [34,52]. Spanning a wider temperature range, the model results also replicate the qualitative trends of the experiments, particularly the characteristically different temperature dependence and iso-propanol blending effects within different temperature regimes. Nevertheless, the model shows insufficiency in quantitative agreement with the experiments, especially with the presence of LTHR where the model overpredicts ITHR extent and t1/t2, which is due likely to LTHR not being fully captured by the model, as reported in [33]. 5.1.2 iso-Butanol Experimental and simulated ITHR extent and t1/t2 for FACE-F/B0–B30 are next summarized in Fig. 4 at the same conditions as in Fig. 2. Here, it is seen that iso-butanol non-linearly promotes ITHR extent at both Tc = 750 and 900 K, with greater effects seen at Tc = 750 k (Fig. 4a), whereas iso-butanol affects ITHR evolution only at Tc = 750 K (Fig. 4b). The qualitative trends observed in Fig. 4 are consistent with those observed in Fig. 2. The model results presented in Fig. 4 generally capture the qualitative trends in experimental measurements at both temperatures and for both ITHR extent and evolution, though there is quantitative disagreement. For instance, at Tc = 900 K, the model indicates a change of blending effects at different blending levels, where the iso-butanol inhibits ITHR extent and reduces t1/t2 at 10 vol% blending, while it exhibits promoting effects with further blending (e.g., at 30 vol% blending). This behavior is most obvious in Fig. 4a when observing the red dashed line. This could imply that there is a competing mechanism in the model that is governing iso-butanol blending effects. As in Section 5.1.1, measured and simulated ITHR characteristics for FACE-F/B0–B30 are next summarized in Fig. 5 as functions of inverse temperature across low- to intermediate-temperature regimes where typical two-stage (i.e., with LTHR) and single-stage (i.e., without LTHR) ignition behaviors have been reported, respectively [33]. Immediately clear from Fig. 5 are the significantly different temperature dependences and iso-butanol blending effects between low and intermediate temperature regimes. The perturbative effects of iso-butanol on both ITHR extent and evolution are significantly enhanced with the onset of LTHR (i.e., Tc < 830 K), and peak at 30 vol% iso-butanol blending and Tc ~ 800 K, where ITHR accounts for ~6.5% of total fuel energy. The model captures the qualitative trends in experiments and demonstrates better agreement with experiments in the intermediate-temperature regime than in the low-temperature regime where the model overpredicts both t1/t2 and the amount of ITHR (by as high as 1.0%LHV at the lowest temperature). The non-linear blending effect of iso-butanol within the low-temperature regime is also overestimated by the model. This is readily seen in Fig. 5a by comparing the experiments and modeling results with respect to the magnitude of difference in ITHR extent between FACE-F/B20 and FACE-F/B30. The overpredicted ITHR extent, particularly for FACE-F/B30, can lead to overestimated ignition reactivity [27]. This has been confirmed in a recent study [33], where the model exhibited stronger ignition reactivity than experiments, and displayed the greatest disagreement with experiments for FACE-F/B30 within the low-temperature regime. 5.1.3 iso-Propanol vs. iso-Butanol Direct comparison of blending effects between iso-propanol and iso-butanol is shown in Fig. 6 , where experimental and simulated ITHR extent (Fig. 6a–c) and t1/t2 (Fig. 6d–f) are presented as functions of inverse temperature at different blending levels. Comparing the experimental results between FACE-F/P10–P30 and FACE-F/B10–B30, iso-propanol and iso-butanol display very similar blending effects on ITHR characteristics of FACE-F at 10 vol% blending, while at 20 and 30 vol% blending levels, the difference between the two iso-alcohols becomes more obvious, with iso-propanol exhibiting greater impact on both ITHR extent and evolution in the low-temperature regime. These trends are successfully captured by the model, though the model consistently overpredicts the ITHR extent for both FACE-F/iso-propanol and FACE-F/iso-butanol blends for Tc > 850 K. The more overpredicted ITHR extent for FACE-F/B10–B30 than for FACE-F/P10–P30 agrees with [33] where the model showed more overpredicted ignition reactivity for FACE-F/B10–B30 than for FACE-F/P10–P30."
8,Sensitivity analysis on ITHR characteristics,"5.2 Sensitivity analysis on ITHR characteristics Given the good agreement between the model and experiments, as discussed in Section 5.1, and the need to understand the underlying chemical kinetics governing the iso-alcohol blending effects on ITHR characteristics, brute force sensitivity analysis is conducted on the extent and evolution of ITHR for FGF-LLNL, FGF-LLNL/P30 and FGF-LLNL/B30 at the same conditions as in Fig. 2 and 4 using variable volume simulations. The sensitivity coefficients are defined as S r e l = ln ( τ Δ τ ) / ln ( k Δ k ) , where τ Δ is the ∫ s o I T H R e o I T H R H H R d t or t1/t2 after multiplying the original rate coefficient by 2, i.e., k Δ = 2 * k , and τ is the original ∫ s o I T H R e o I T H R H H R d t or t1/t2. Figure 7 presents the 15 most sensitive reactions on ∫ s o I T H R e o I T H R H H R d t for FGF-LLNL/P0 and FGF-LLNL/P30, while Fig. 8 presents the 15 most sensitive reactions on ∫ s o I T H R e o I T H R H H R d t for FGF-LLNL/B0 and FGF-LLNL/B30. The results on t1/t2 for FGF-LLNL/iso-propanol and FGF-LLNL/iso-butanol blends are included in the Supplementary Material as Fig. S3 and S4, respectively. Negative coefficients indicate an inhibiting effect on ITHR extent or an accelerating effect on ITHR evolution, while positive coefficients indicate a promoting effect on ITHR extent or a decelerating effect on ITHR evolution. Different colors are used to denote the fuel-specific reactions from each sub-chemistry, while reactions in black/italic are non-fuel-specific reactions where the participating species can be produced or consumed by various sub-chemistries. The species participating in these reactions can be identified in the species dictionary in the Supplementary Material. 5.2.1 iso-Propanol The strong promoting effect of iso-propanol on ITHR extent at Tc = 750 K, as observed in Fig. 2a, is supported by the sensitivity analysis results in Fig. 7a. Specifically, with 30 vol% iso-propanol addition, the fuel specific reactions from iso-propanol sub-chemistry, such as the H-atom abstraction from the α-carbon site (IC3H7OH+OH=TC3H6OH+H2O) and the β-scission of QOOH radical (IC3H6OH-1OOH-2=IC3H5OH+HO2), greatly promote the extent of ITHR. The former even outcompetes the reactions from other sub-chemistries and the C0–C4 core chemistry, becoming the top promoting reaction for FGF-LLNL/P30. It is worth noting that both promoting reactions from iso-propanol sub-chemistry are favorable for HO2 production and ȮH scavenging. For instance, the top promoting reaction (IC3H7OH+OH=TC3H6OH+H2O) consumes ȮH and leads to the formation of acetone + HO2 [3,53]. This trend is in fact consistently observed for other fuel-specific reactions (e.g., those from iso-octane, n-heptane and cyclopentane as shown in Fig. 7a), where the reactions leading to ȮH branching suppress ITHR extent, whereas those leading to ȮH consumption or HO2 production promote ITHR extent. When temperature is increased to Tc = 900 K (Fig. 7b), typical low temperature fuel-specific reactions from iso-propanol sub-chemistry that contribute to ȮH scavenging and HO2 production become less important, while abstraction reactions from iso-propanol by HO2 radical forming H2O2 are promoted. The produced H2O2 radical from the latter can undergo unimolecular decomposition at this temperature, which forms two ȮH radicals that lead the reaction pathway towards ȮH branching, thus inhibiting ITHR extent. An example is IC3H7OH+HO2=TC3H6OH+H2O2, as can be seen in Fig. 7b, which is the second most inhibiting reaction on ITHR extent for FGF-LLNL/P30. These changes result in the reduced promoting effect of iso-propanol on ITHR extent at Tc = 900 K in comparison to Tc = 750 K, as previously seen in Fig. 2a. The most sensitive reactions on ITHR evolution at Tc = 750 K (Fig. S3a) are nearly identical to those observed in Fig. 7a, where iso-propanol greatly increases t1/t2 for FGF-LLNL/P30 via fuel-specific reactions. However, at Tc = 900 K (Fig. S3b), all the most sensitive reactions for both FGF-LLNL/P0 and FGF-LLNL/P30 have negligible sensitivities, indicating insignificant impact of iso-propanol blending on ITHR evolution at this temperature, which is consistent with the trend shown in Fig. 2b. 5.2.2 iso-Butanol First seen in Fig. 8a is the strong impact of iso-butanol on ITHR extent at Tc = 750 K, since with 30 vol% iso-butanol blending, both the top inhibiting and promoting reactions become the reactions from iso-butanol sub-chemistry. On one hand, iso-butanol greatly promotes ITHR extent via the H-atom abstraction by ȮH from the α-carbon site (IC4H9OH+OH=IC4H8OH-C+H2O), which later leads to the production of HO2 and a C4 aldehyde, a reaction path that scavenges ȮH and yields less reactive products, while on the other hand, iso-butanol also strongly inhibits ITHR extent via the reactions leading to ȮH branching, e.g., H-atom abstraction by ȮH from the γ-carbon site (IC4H9OH+OH=IC4H8OH+H2O). At Tc = 900 K (Fig. 8b), the top promoting reaction at Tc = 750 K becomes insignificant, while the top inhibiting reaction at Tc = 750 K still contributes as the second most inhibiting reaction. Other inhibiting reactions from iso-butanol sub-chemistry also become important, such as the abstraction by HO2 from the α-carbon site (IC4H9OH+HO2=IC4H8OH-C+H2O2) and the abstraction by ȮH from the C4 aldehyde. The change in role of the most sensitive fuel-specific reactions for iso-butanol at different temperatures explains the smaller promoting impact on ITHR extent at Tc = 900 K observed in Fig. 4a, which is due in part to the relatively stronger contribution from the fuel-specific reactions that favor ȮH scavenging and HO2 production in comparison to the ȮH branching reactions. The overall inhibiting effect on ITHR extent from iso-butanol fuel-specific reactions (i.e., the pink reactions) at Tc = 900 K, as indicated by the longer sensitivity bars for the inhibiting reactions than the promoting reactions, could also be the reason for the reduction in ITHR extent at 10 vol% iso-butanol blending, as seen in Fig. 4a. However, this does not explain the increased ITHR extent at 30 vol% iso-butanol blending in Fig. 4a, indicating that there are other significant contributors to the overall iso-butanol blending effects, e.g., non-fuel-specific reactions. The competition between the inhibiting and promoting reactions specific to iso-butanol sub-chemistry is also observed with the most sensitive reactions on ITHR evolution, though only at Tc = 750 K (Fig. S4a). 5.2.3 iso-Propanol vs. iso-Butanol Also seen from Figs. 7,8, S3 and S4 is the difference between iso-propanol and iso-butanol in the role of fuel-specific reactions. First, at Tc = 750 K, the most important reactions promoting and inhibiting the extent and evolution of ITHR by iso-butanol have about twice the impact compared to iso-propanol, as indicated by the pink reactions and the length of their black bars in Fig. 7a, 8a, S3a and S4a. Second, at Tc = 750 K, the fuel-specific reaction from iso-butanol sub-chemistry (i.e., IC4H9OH+OH=IC4H8OH+H2O) shows a suppressing effect on ITHR extent that approximately cancels out the promoting effect from IC4H9OH+OH=IC4H8OH-C+H2O (Fig. 8a), whereas such inhibiting fuel-specific reactions are considerably less important for iso-propanol (Fig. 7a) compared to the promoting fuel-specific reactions. This is likely due to the higher availability for iso-butanol to undergo typical low-temperature ȮH branching pathways than for iso-propanol, where iso-propanol oxidation is more favored towards the formation of acetone and HO2 via TC3H6OH+O2=CH3COCH3+HO2 [33]. This difference also agrees well with the smaller promoting effect of iso-butanol on ITHR extent in the low-temperature regime, as observed in Fig. 6c."
9,Blending effects via non-fuel-specific reactions,"5.3 Blending effects via non-fuel-specific reactions The discussions in Section 5.2 focused on fuel-specific reactions while Figs. 7, 8, S3 and S4 also highlight the importance of non-fuel specific reactions. This is most obvious in Figs. 7b and 8b, where the dependence of ITHR extent on non-fuel-specific reactions is greater than that on fuel-specific reactions. Also, the analyses in Section 5.2.2 suggest that there are other significant contributors besides fuel-specific reactions to the iso-butanol blending effects observed in Figs. 4 and 5, which are most likely the chemical kinetic interactions via non-fuel-specific reactions, termed intermolecular chemical kinetic interaction. For instance, two non-fuel-specific reactions are identified in Fig. 7a as important inhibiting reactions for ITHR extent, i.e., CH3CHO+HO2=CH3CO+H2O2 and CH2O+HO2=HCO+H2O2. The participating carbonated reactants, namely CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) and CH2O (formaldehyde), are major intermediates from iso-propanol and iso-butanol oxidation. Blending iso-propanol and iso-butanol into FACE-F is expected to lead to change in radical pool for these intermediates, thus modifying the flux of their associated pathways that are originally presented in FACE-F oxidation. These changes will indirectly lead to changes in ȮH and HO2 radical pools, which eventually result in altered ITHR characteristics. Characterizing such intermolecular interactions is necessary to understand the underlying chemical kinetics governing iso-alcohol blending effects. This is done in the following sections. 5.3.1 The impact of intermolecular chemical kinetic interactions on ITHR characteristics The impact of all the intermolecular chemical kinetic interactions on ITHR characteristics is first evaluated. It should be noted that the interactions considered in this work are referred to as the pathways where at least one participating species is carbonated, and can be produced and consumed by at least two sub-chemistries. To do so, it is necessary to disable the intermolecular interactions between FGF-LLNL and the iso-alcohol with respect to the non-fuel-specific carbonated intermediates. This is achieved using the molecular tagging approach proposed by Cheng et al. [27]. The details of the approach can be found in [27], hence it is only briefly described here. First, a duplicate of the gasoline surrogate chemistry model in Section 3.2 is created, in which the species carbon element is tagged as lowercase ‘c’ and the non-carbonated sub-chemistries, namely hydrogen and nitrogen sub-chemistries, are removed. The duplicate is then combined with the original model in which the species carbon element is tagged as uppercase ‘C’. As such, in the combined model, there are one set of hydrogen and nitrogen sub-chemistries, and two sets of carbonated species and their associated reactions with identical thermodynamic and rate parameters, respectively, but different notations for the carbon element, i.e., ‘c’ and ‘C’. With this treatment, the intermolecular interactions between the iso-alcohol and FGF-LLNL can be disabled if the carbon element in that the iso-alcohol is tagged as ‘c’, while those in FGF-LLNL components are tagged as ‘C’. This is because the carbonated, non-fuel-specific intermediates generated from the ‘c’ chemistry are not compatible with the ‘C’ chemistry. It is important to recognize that this will not affect the communication in the non-carbonated intermediates (e.g., ȮH, HO2 radicals), since the hydrogen and nitrogen sub-chemistries are shared between the ‘c’ and ‘C’ chemistries. Simulated heat release rate trajectories with and without intermolecular interactions between the iso-alcohol and FGF-LLNL, and the corresponding simulated pressure-time histories, are summarized in Figs. 9 and 10 for FGF-LLNL/P30 and FGF-LLNL/B30, respectively, at Pc = 43 bar and two representative temperatures (i.e., Tc = 750 and 900 K). Only 30 vol% iso-alcohol blends are presented here since the impact of intermolecular interactions is greatest at this blending level. The results for FGF-LLNL/P0–P20 and FGF-LLNL/B0–B20 are included as Fig. S5 and S6, respectively, in the Supplementary Material. It can be seen from Figs. 9 and 10 that for both iso-alcohols, intermolecular chemical kinetic interactions contribute significantly to ITHR behavior at both temperatures, where disabling all the intermolecular interactions leads to delayed ITHR evolution, and reduced ignition reactivity. This impact is more pronounced at Tc = 750 K, though muting intermolecular interactions has negligible impact on LTHR and first-stage ignition characteristics for both FGF-LLNL/P30 and FGF-LLNL/B30. There are also differences between the two iso-alcohols, where the impact of intermolecular interactions for FGF-LLNL/B30 is smaller than that for FGF-LLNL/P30. Comparing Figs. 9a and 10a, it is also seen that FGF-LLNL/B30 exhibits stronger LTHR than FGF-LLNL/P30, which supports the speculation made earlier in Section 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 where the smaller promoting impact on ITHR extent for iso-butanol in comparison to iso-propanol is attributed to its greater low-temperature reactivity that facilitates ȮH production. 5.3.2 Flux and rate of production analyses Rate of production (ROP) and flux analyses are further conducted using variable-volume simulations for FGF-LLNL, FGF-LLNL/P30 and FGF-LLNL/B30 at the diluted/stoichiometric condition, Pc = 43 bar and Tc = 750 K. Tc = 750 K is selected due to the greater impact of intermolecular interactions at this condition, as seen in Figs. 9a and 10a. The results at Tc = 900 K are included as Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Material. Analyses are conducted at eoITHR, as marked in Figs. 9a and 10a, covering fluxes from the production of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) to the formation of carbon dioxide (CO2). The fluxes (bold numbers) are shown in percent, which are computed as the ratio of the rate of consumption (or production) for that pathway to the total rate of consumption (or production). The ROP's are normalized by the rate of production of the corresponding pathway for ‘neat’ FGF-LLNL. With this treatment, the ROP's (italic numbers) for FGF-LLNL are always fixed at 1.00, while those for FGF-LLNL/P30 and FGF-LLNL/B30 can vary, with values above and below 1.00 indicating a promoting and inhibiting effect, respectively, on the ROP for that pathway. The participating species can be identified in the species dictionary in the Supplementary Material. It can be seen from Fig. 11 that both iso-alcohols facilitate CH3CHO production, though via different pathways. iso-Propanol contributes primarily via the decomposition of primary fuel radicals such as IC3H6OH-1O2 (product from oxygen addition to hydroxyl propyl radical) and IC3H7O (product from H-atom abstraction on the ȮH moiety of iso-propanol), which are the products from the most dominant iso-propanol consuming pathways, as can be seen in Fig. S8a, while iso-butanol contributes, in addition to the primary pathways for iso-propanol, also via decomposition of OHC3H6O2, CH3CHOOHCJO, C3H5-SO2 and C3H5-S, for which there is a decrease in ROP for FGF-LLNL/P30 compared to FGF-LLNL. The changes in ROP for these CH3CHO producing pathways also lead to respective changes in their flux ratios. By comparing FGF-LLNL/P30 and FGF-LLNL/B30, there is a stronger promoting effect on CH3CHO production from iso-propanol compared to iso-butanol, where the ROP via the two primary contributing pathways are increased by 16.28 and 17.28 times for FGF-LLNL/P30, while these are considerably smaller for FGF-LLNL/B30 (i.e., increased by 1.63 and 3.38 times, respectively). The increased ROP of CH3CHO also leads to increased rate of consumption (ROC) for all CH3CHO consuming pathways. This is observed for both FGF-LLNL/iso-alcohol blends, with FGF-LLNL/P30 displaying greater gain in ROC than for FGF-LLNL/B30, as indicated by the greater red/italic numbers for FGF-LLNL/P30 in Fig. 11. Although the ROC is considerably different from that without iso-alcohol addition (FGF-LLNL), the branching ratio between the CH3CHO consuming pathways are similar between all the fuels, as shown by the bold numbers in Fig. 11. Almost all the produced CH3CHO are converted to CH3CO and, less significantly, CH2CHO. The former undergoes unimolecular decomposition to form a methyl radical (CH3). Production of CH3 radicals is greatly promoted by iso-propanol blending via the facilitated CH3CHO producing pathways as aforementioned, and also the other two major pathways: (i) decomposition of CH3COCH2O, where the ROP is 3.41 times higher than that for FGF-LLNL, and (ii) decomposition of CH3COCH2, which is a product from acetone (a major product from iso-propanol consumption at eoITHR, as seen in Fig. S8a). iso-Butanol also promotes CH3 production primarily via acetaldehyde consumption and, less significantly, pathway (i). The promoting effect of iso-butanol is less significantly than iso-propanol, as can be seen from the ROP's in Fig. 11. Additionally, 30 vol% iso-butanol blending leads to a 12% reduction in the ROP of pathway (ii) compared to FGF-LLNL, opposite to that observed for FGF-LLNL/P30. The stronger promoting impact on CH3 production for iso-propanol than iso-butanol is propagated throughout the pathways from the consumption of CH3 to the formation of CH2O, except for an HO2 consuming pathway (CH3O2+HO2=CH3O2H+O2) where FGF-LLNL/B30 shows higher ROC and flux than FGF-LLNL/P30 (i.e., 1.71 in ROC and 29.4 in flux for FGF-LLNL/B30 vs. 1.46 in ROC and 27.9 in flux for FGF-LLNL/P30). CH2CO production for FGF-LLNL/P30 is primarily contributed by CH3COCH2 decomposition, which leads to similar ROP of CH2OH with FGF-LLNL via CH2CO+OH=CH2OH+CO (i.e., 0.97 for FGF-LLNL/P30 vs. 1.00 for FGF-LLNL). iso-Butanol, on the other hand, leads to a much lower ROP of CH2CO via CH3COCH2 decomposition, which leads to a smaller ROP via CH2CO+OH=CH2OH+CO for FGF-LLNL/B30 compared to FGF-LLNL and FGF-LLNL/P30. This deficit is compensated via a pathway that is unique for iso-butanol, i.e., via the decomposition of IC4H8OH, a product from H-atom abstraction from the γ-carbon site of iso-butanol, which is the second most contributing pathway for iso-butanol consumption at eoITHR (Fig. S8b). The ROP of CH2OH and the flux via this pathway is 264 and ~100 times higher, respectively, than those for FGF-LLNL. IC4H8OH decomposition also yields C3H6, which later leads to formation of C3H5-S and C3H5-SO2, explaining the promoting effect of iso-butanol on CH3CHO production via the pathways consuming C3H5-S and C3H5-SO2, as shown at the start of reaction pathways in Fig. 11. Although both iso-alcohols contribute via different mechanisms to the production of CH3CHO, CH3 and CH2OH radicals, they eventually lead to increased production of CH2O. This is seen from the overall higher ROC of CH2O for both FGF-LLNL/iso-alcohol blends than for FGF-LLNL, particularly for the top two consuming pathways that account for over 85% of CH2O consumption (i.e., CH2O+OH=HCO+H2O and CH2O+HO2=HCO+H2O2). iso-Propanol displays greater promoting effect than iso-butanol on the ROP for almost all the CH2O consuming pathways. This is primarily due to the higher ROP for CH3CHO as previously discussed, and for CH2O via IC3H6OH-1O2 decomposition (Fig. 11) from iso-propanol blending. The trend is however different for CH2O+HO2=HCO+H2O2, where FGF-LLNL/B30 exhibits the greatest ROC and flux, which is consistent with the trend observed with the consuming pathways for CH3O2 + HO2. Previous discussion in Section 5.2 has revealed that pathways leading to HO2 production tend to promote ITHR extent, and vice versa. The fact that iso-butanol blending favoring HO2 consuming pathways more than iso-propanol aligns well with the results in Fig. 6c where FGF-LLNL/P30 exhibits greater amount of ITHR than FGF-LLNL/B30. Over 98% of produced CH2O are converted to HCO, which subsequently forms CO and CO2 mainly via HCO+O2=CO+HO2 and CO+OH=CO2+H, respectively. Both iso-alcohols leads to slight increase in ROP for these two pathways. 5.3.3 Heat rate of production analysis per reaction Heat rate of production analysis is further performed for individual non-fuel-specific reactions for FGF-LLNL, FGF-LLNL/P30 and FGF-LLNL/B30 at eoITHR, and the same conditions as in Fig. 11. The results for the top 15 exothermic reactions for FGF-LLNL/P30 and FGF-LLNL/B30 are summarized in Fig. 12 , where the heat rate of production is subtracted by the heat rate of production for the corresponding reaction for ‘neat’ FGF-LLNL; that is, if a reaction shows a positive (negative) value in heat rate of production, it means that iso-alcohol blending promotes (suppresses) heat release via this reaction. It can be seen from Fig. 12 that chemical kinetic interactions via the most sensitive non-fuel-specific reactions show an overall promoting effect on heat rate of production observed for both FGF-LLNL/P30 and FGF-LLNL/B30. For both FGF-LLNL/iso-alcohol blends, HO2+HO2=H2O2+O2 contributes the most to facilitate heat release at eoITHR. Heat release rate from this reaction is increased by ~60 J/cm3/s for FGF-LLNL/B30, and somewhat less for FGF-LLNL/P30, by ~43 J/cm3/s. This difference corroborates with the results in Fig. 11 (Fig. 11 indicates that iso-butanol favors HO2 consuming pathways), as well as other work [33] wherein FGF-LLNL/B20 displayed a greater consumption of HO2 than FGF-LLNL/P20 via HO2+HO2=H2O2+O2 at 5% iso-octane consumption and the same thermodynamic conditions as in Fig. 12. Importance is also highlighted for other exothermic reactions involving reactants such as CH3CHO, CH3, CH2OH, CH2O and HCO, where the heat release rate from these reactions is consistently augmented with 30 vol% iso-alcohol blending, as indicated by the positive values for these reactions in Fig. 12. Comparing FGF-LLNL/P30 and FGF-LLNL/B30, there is a greater increase in heat release rate for FGF-LLNL/P30 from CH3+O2(+M)=CH3O2(+M), CH2O+OH=HCO+H2O and CH3CHO+OH=CH3CO+H2O, while that from CH2OH+O2=CH2O+OH is increased more for FGF-LLNL/B30. These trends align well with the results in Fig. 11, where iso-propanol contributes more to the production of CH3, CH2O and CH3CHO, whereas iso-butanol produces more CH2OH via IC4H8OH decomposition. Also seen in Fig. 12 are the opposite perturbative effects between iso-propanol and iso-butanol. Specifically, in comparison to FGF-LLNL, FGF-LLNL/B30 exhibits greater heat release rate from CH3CHOOHCJO=>CH3CHO+CO+OH than ‘neat’ FGF-LLNL, whereas there is a reduction in heat release rate from this reaction for FGF-LLNL/P30. The opposite perturbative effects are also observed for CH3+HO2=CH3O+OH and CH3+HO2=CH4+O2, which are less pronounced. This, again, can be attributed to the difference between iso-propanol and iso-butanol in the way they intermolecularly interact with FGF-LLNL, as shown in Fig. 11. For instance, Fig. 11 indicates that the flux and ROP via CH3CHOOHCJO=>CH3CHO+CO+OH are considerably increased by adding 30 vol% iso-butanol to FGF-LLNL, while this pathway is less available for FGF-LLNL/P30 in comparison to ‘neat’ FGF-LLNL. This is because CH3CHOOHCJO is product of the reaction between the α-radical of iso-butanol and O2, a pathway not available for FGF-LLNL/P30 and ‘neat’ FGF-LLNL. Based on the results in Fig. 11, the heat rate of production from this reaction is expected to follow the order of FGF-LLNL/B30 > FGF-LLNL > FGF-LLNL/P30."
10,Summary and conclusions,"The blending effects of iso-propanol and iso-butanol on the ITHR characteristics of a research-grade gasoline, namely FACE-F, are explored and compared in ANL's heated twin-piston RCM at Pc = 43 bar and a diluted/stoichiometric fuel loading, and across low- to intermediate-temperature regimes. Comprehensive analyses of experimental and modeling results indicate the following: • Within the low-temperature regime, both iso-propanol and iso-butanol promote the extent of ITHR and extend the evolution of ITHR, with stronger perturbation observed for iso-propanol. Within the intermediate-temperature regime where LTHR is completely muted, influences of both iso-alcohols are significantly muted. • The model, in conjunction with the five-component surrogate (FGF-LLNL), well captures the experimental results, with better agreement observed in the intermediate-temperature regime, for iso-propanol, and at lower blending levels. • Sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of fuel-specific reactions from iso-alcohol sub-chemistry, with reactions leading to ȮH branching (termination) inhibiting (promoting) ITHR extent and accelerating (decelerating) ITHR evolution. • The importance of chemical kinetic interactions via non-fuel-specific reactions is also highlighted, where disabling such interactions between iso-alcohols and FGF-LLNL leads to distinctly longer duration of ITHR and reduced ignition reactivity. • Direct comparison between iso-propanol and iso-butanol reveals their significantly different mechanisms that influence the ITHR characteristics of FGF-LLNL. Specifically: - iso-Butanol greatly suppresses and accelerates ITHR extent and evolution, respectively, via typical ȮH branching fuel-specific pathways, whereas this effect is considerably less pronounced for iso-propanol. - Both iso-alcohols greatly facilitate ITHR via non-fuel-specific chemical kinetic interactions, with iso-propanol contributing more to the production of CH3CHO, CH3CO and CH3, while iso-butanol contributes more to CH2OH production via IC4H8OH decomposition."
