0,Introduction,"The hydrogenolysis of esters is a key step in the production of fatty alcohols (from natural fatty esters) and other lower alkyl alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol [1–4]. Copper based catalysts are commonly used because they possess high selectivities for activation of the C–O bonds rather than the C–C bonds [4]. For example, Cu chromite catalysts are well-established for the commercial production of fatty alcohols, although increasing environmental concerns with regard to Cr have resulted in the search for new formulations [5]. Other catalysts containing less toxic materials, such as Cu/SiO2 [6] and Cu/ZnO [7], have been reported to possess ester hydrogenolysis activities and selectivities that are similar to those for Cu chromite catalysts. Nevertheless, new catalyst formulations are being sought to enhance the performance and sustainability of this process. Of particular interest here is the low temperature (<200°C), liquid phase hydrogenolysis of esters, a key intermediate step during the low temperature hydrogenation of CO or CO2 to methanol [8–10]. Christiansen [11] first described a two-step process for converting syngas (CO and H2) into methanol at 180°C via (i) carbonylation of an alcohol to the corresponding ester over a sodium methoxide catalyst and (ii) hydrogenolysis of the ester to methanol and the parent alcohol over a reduced Cu oxide catalyst (see Fig. 1a). Liu et al. explored the use of potassium methoxide and Cu chromite catalysts for this process at 140–180°C [12]. They suggested the formate hydrogenolysis was rate-limiting due in part to deactivation of the Cu chromite catalyst by CO. Fan et al. [10] reported the liquid phase hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol over Cu-Zn or Cu-Cr based catalysts at 200°C and proposed that the reaction occurred via a multistep pathway. The proposed reaction pathway involved (i) hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid, (ii) esterification of formic acid to alkyl formate, and (iii) hydrogenolysis of the formate to methanol and the corresponding alcohol (Fig. 1b). They also suggested that formate hydrogenolysis was the rate-limiting step in the overall reaction system, encouraging the development of more active catalysts for this step. Recently Huff and Sanford [13] demonstrated homogeneous catalysts for the cascade hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. This system included a (PMe3)4Ru(Cl)(OAc) catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid, Sc(OTf)3 catalyst for the esterification of formic acid with ethanol, and (PNN)Ru(CO)(H) catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of ethyl formate. A key limitation for this homogeneous cascade system was incompatibility of the ester hydrogenolysis catalyst with other components and reactant species [13,14]. A variety of Cu-based catalysts, including Raney Cu [15], Cu/SiO2 [16], Cu chromite [9,17,18] and Cu/ZnO [19], have been reported to be active for the liquid phase hydrogenolysis of alkyl formates at temperatures in the range of 110–200°C. Copper chromite catalysts are among the most active; however, their poor tolerance to CO reduces the feasibility of using this type of catalyst in processes where CO or CO2 is present [15,20]. A variety of oxide supported Pt and Pd catalysts (including ZnO, Ga2O3, In2O3, and SiO2) have also been reported to be active for gas phase methyl formate hydrogenolysis at 150°C. The ZnO and In2O3 supported catalysts provided the highest selectivities to methanol possibly due to the formation of alloys (e.g. Pt–Zn and Pd–In), although a substantial Pd or Pt loading (10wt%) was required to achieve the best performance [21]. Braca et al. [22] reported that several Re-based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts were highly active and selective for the hydrogenolysis of formate at 200°C, albeit at high H2 pressures (∼100bar). For the heterogeneous catalysts, the acidity/basicity of the support (SiO2, TiO2, Nb2O5, and MgO) had a significant effect on catalytic performance [22]. Rhenium, however, is relatively expensive, which makes it less attractive for large-scale applications. Research described in this paper investigated the low temperature, liquid phase hydrogenolysis of ethyl formate over Mo carbide and nitride supported Cu catalysts. Mo carbides and nitrides possess catalytic properties that can sometimes resemble those for platinum-group-metals [23–26]; these similarities in catalytic properties are highly dependent on the reaction conditions and intermediate species [27]. Mo carbides and nitrides have also been reported to catalyze a variety of reactions including Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) [28,29], water–gas shift (WGS) [30], alcohol steam reforming [31,32], and hydrodenitrogenation [33]. Like other early transition metal carbides and nitrides [23,24], these materials can be synthesized with surface areas exceeding 100m2/g [34–36]. The carbides in particular have also been reported to be effective supports, facilitating the production of highly dispersed Pt, Pd, Co and Cu domains, and in some cases, modifying the electronic properties of these metals [31,37]. This modification can result in superior catalytic performance for carbide supported metals. For example, Schweitzer et al. reported a Pt/Mo2C catalyst that significantly outperformed oxide supported Pt catalysts for WGS [38]. Lausche et al. described a Pd/W2C catalyst which demonstrated higher rates and selectivities than those for bulk Pd catalysts during the selective, electrocatalytic hydrogenation of triglycerides [39]. Furthermore, Mo carbides and nitrides, known CO [28,29] and CO2 hydrogenation catalysts [40,41], are naturally tolerant to CO and CO2. In addition to the supported Cu catalysts, we also synthesized and evaluated a series of Pd/Mo2C and Cu-Pd/Mo2C catalysts, as oxide supported Pd catalysts have been reported to be active and selective for ester hydrogenolysis [21]. Performance characteristics for the Mo carbide and nitride supported catalysts were compared to those for conventional oxide supported Cu catalysts."
1,Material and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization The Mo2C and Mo2N materials were synthesized from an ammonium molybdate (AM) precursor (Alfa Aesar) using a temperature programmed reaction (TPR) technique. The Mo2C was prepared by reducing AM in H2 at 350°C for 12h, followed by treatment in 15% CH4/H2 at 590°C for 2h, and the resulting material was then quenched to room temperature. The Mo2N was synthesized by reacting AM with anhydrous NH3 as the temperature was linearly heated from room temperature to 350°C (33min), then to 450°C (2.5h) and finally to 700°C (2.5h) followed by a soak at this temperature for 1h before quenching to room temperature. Other details regarding the synthesis procedures have been described in previous reports [33,37]. Metals were deposited onto the Mo2C or Mo2N supports using a wet impregnation technique. Typically, carbides and nitrides are passivated prior to exposure to air to avoid bulk oxidation of the material [36]. To avoid passivation and deposit metals directly onto the native Mo2C or Mo2N surfaces (as opposed to a passivated surface), the freshly-synthesized materials were transferred under an inert gas (CH4/H2 or He) into a deaerated aqueous solution containing a target concentration of Cu(NO3)2 or Pd(NO3)2·4NH3 and then allowed to interact for at least 20h. Argon was continuously purging through the solutions during the wet impregnation process to deaerate and agitate the solution. The synthesized metal/Mo2C catalysts were pyrophoric, indicating the absence of surface passivation on the final materials. Such observation also suggests that neither exposure of H2O nor NO3 − (during the wet impregnation process) has passivated/oxidized the catalyst surface. Schweitzer et al. reported that passivation/oxidation with deaerated H2O did not occur and was not thermodynamically favorable [38]. Our finding on the absence of surface passivation of Mo2C catalysts, therefore, is consistent with the literature conclusion. The resulting catalyst slurry was dried at 110°C for 2h and reduced in flowing H2 (400mL/min) at 300°C for 4h to decompose the nitrate and produce the Cu or Pd domains. Preparation of the Cu-Pd/Mo2C catalysts was achieved sequentially by first depositing Cu onto Mo2C, followed by transferring the dried Cu/Mo2C under an inert atmosphere to a deaerated aqueous solution containing the target concentration of Pd(NO3)2·4NH3. The catalyst was allowed to interact for 5h and was dried and reduced in a quartz tube reactor using the protocols described earlier. Properties for the Mo2C- and Mo2N-based catalysts were compared to those for bulk and oxide supported Cu catalysts. Nano-Cu (QuantumSphere), Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (Süd-Chemie/Clariant), and Cu/Cr2CuO4 (Cu Chromite, Strem Chemicals Inc.) catalysts were acquired from commercial vendors and used after pretreatment (described later). The Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 and Cu/Cr2CuO4 catalysts are referred to as “Cu-Zn-Al” and “Cu-Cr”, respectively. The Cu/γ-Al2O3, Cu/SiO2, and Cu/C catalysts were synthesized via incipient wetness impregnation of γ-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 0.4cm3/g pore volume), fumed SiO2 (AEROSIL®, 0.8cm3/g pore volume), and carbon black (Fuel Cell Store, Vulcan XC-72R, 0.8cm3/g pore volume) with aqueous solutions of Cu(NO3)2 (5wt% nominal loading). The supports were pelletized, then ground and sieved to 125–250μm prior to impregnation with the Cu solution. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried in vacuum at 110°C for 16h and then annealed under N2 flow (100mL/min) at 300°C for 5h to decompose the nitrate from Cu(NO3)2. A Cu/ZrO2 (referred to as Cu-Zr) catalyst was synthesized via a co-precipitation technique with a 1:1 molar ratio of Cu(NO3)2 and Zr(NO3)2 precursors, based on a protocol described elsewhere [42]. Surface areas of the materials were determined from N2 physisorption isotherms collected using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 analyzer. The isotherms were analyzed using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Prior to the measurements, the catalysts were degassed (<5mmHg) for at least 4h at elevated temperatures (350°C for the Mo2C or Mo2N based catalysts, 200°C for the other Cu-based catalysts). The bulk crystalline structures of the catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction performed using a Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5418Å). The diffraction patterns were obtained by scanning 2θ from 10 to 90° at a scan rate of 5°/min. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP-OES, Varian 710-ES analyzer) was used to determine the metal compositions for the Mo2C and Mo2N based catalysts. As appropriate, the metal content is included in the catalyst name; for example, 5wt% Mo2C supported Cu is referred to as “5 Cu/Mo2C”."
3,Activity and selectivity measurements,"2.2 Activity and selectivity measurements Ethyl formate was selected as the reactant so that CH3OH produced from other pathways could be distinguished from the parent alcohol of the formate. All of the experiments were performed in a 50mL autoclave Parr reactor, equipped with a variable-speed impeller. A gas chromatograph (GC) (Varian 450, equipped with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors) was connected directly to the reactor gas outlet for online gas product analysis. A filter was also added to separate the liquid products from the catalyst particles when withdrawing liquid samples; the liquids were analyzed offline using a gas chromatograph (Varian 450) with a flame ionization detector. All of the Cu-based catalysts were pretreated in 4% H2/N2 (100mL/min) at 200°C for 4h in the reactor prior to measurement of the rates and selectivities. The Mo2C or Mo2N-based catalysts were used as synthesized without passivation. To avoid contact of the materials with air, they were transferred under an inert atmosphere and stored in an Ar filled glovebox. The reactant solution was prepared by adding 0.6mmol ethyl formate (Acro Organics, 99%) to 37.5mL 1,4-dioxane (Acro Organics, 99+%, 100ppm water); decane (10μL) was introduced as an internal standard for GC analysis. The reactant solution and 200mg catalyst were loaded into the reactor. The Mo2C and Mo2N materials were loaded into the reactor in the glovebox due to their pyrophoricity. After loading the catalysts, 30bar of H2 was charged into the reactor through a dip tube (immersed in the solvent) to allow sufficient gas dissolution. The solubility of H2 in 1,4-dioxane is 0.14M at 135°C and 30bar H2 [43]. The reactor was then heated at a rate of 5°C/min from room temperature to 135°C, and agitated at a constant rate of 300rpm. The start of the reaction was designated as the time at which the reactor temperature reached 135°C. The reactor was maintained at 135°C throughout the reaction. Each experiment was repeated at least twice and the errors were calculated considering both the standard deviations from replicates and GC analyses. Carbon balances closed to within ±8% for all the experiments. The conversion was defined as the percentage of the initial ethyl formate consumed during the reaction, while the selectivity was defined as the molar ratio of a specific product over the total products. The reaction rates were evaluated from temporal variations in the amounts of ethyl formate consumed or CH3OH formed."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Physical properties,"3.1 Physical properties The surface areas, Cu contents, and Cu crystallite sizes for the supported Cu, Mo2C and Mo2N catalysts are listed in Table 1 . As expected, the Cu/C, Cu/SiO2 and all of the Mo2C- and Mo2N-based catalysts possessed high surface areas (>100m2/g). The reduced surface areas for the Cu/Mo2C and Cu/Mo2N catalysts compared to their corresponding support materials are likely a consequence of pore blockage by the Cu nanoparticles. The Cu/γ-Al2O3, Cu-Zn-Al, Cu-Cr, and Cu-Zr catalysts exhibited moderate surface areas (45–80m2/g), while the Nano-Cu material had a relatively low surface area. X-ray diffraction patterns for the catalysts are displayed in Fig. 2 . The bulk and supported Mo2C-based catalysts contained a mixture of α-MoC1− x (face centered cubic) and β-Mo2C (hexagonal close packed); each phase was determined by matching the XRD patterns to the standard spectra reported in the literature [44,45]. The two phases showed approximately a 1:1 ratio as calculated using the whole pattern fitting Rietveld refinement technique (JADE 7.0). α-MoC1− x and β-Mo2C have similar Mo:C ratios (∼2:1), as suggested by the elemental analysis, therefore catalysts containing these materials will be referred to as Mo2C for simplicity. Such composition was also reported by several works in the literature on the same type of Mo2C material [32,46]. The Mo2N-based catalysts contained only γ-Mo2N phase. Only a weak peak associated with Cu (41° 2θ) was detected for the Cu/Mo2C catalyst and Cu peaks could not be clearly defined for the Mo2N supported material. These findings suggested that the Cu dispersion was relatively higher on Mo2C and Mo2N compared to that on other supports, although it was possible that the Cu and γ-Mo2N peaks overlapped at ∼41° 2θ. Sharp Cu peaks are observed for the Nano Cu material, indicating that it is phase pure with large crystallites. Cu peaks, as well as peaks for the support oxides, were observed for most of the oxide supported catalysts. Peaks attributable to the oxides were weak or non-existent for the Cu-Cr, Cu-Zr and Cu/SiO2 catalysts, suggesting that the oxide particles were very small (<5nm) or amorphous. In addition, a weak peak was detected for the Cu-Cr catalyst at 54° 2θ. This peak is consistent with the presence of CuO [40]. The Cu crystallite sizes were smallest for the Cu/Mo2C catalyst; the Cu crystallite size was not quantified for the Cu/Mo2N catalyst, as the peak at ∼41° 2θ could not be isolated from that for the γ-Mo2N support."
6,Catalytic activities and selectivities,"3.2 Catalytic activities and selectivities The ethyl formate hydrogenolysis reaction rates and selectivities over the supported Cu, Mo2C and Mo2N catalysts are shown in Table 2 . Ethyl formate hydrogenolysis generates CH3OH and C2H5OH in an equimolar ratio (Eq. (1)), i.e. a 50% selectivity should be expected for each alcohol product. However, we observed that the selectivities to methanol were less than 50% over all of the catalysts, while the selectivities to ethanol were consistently around 50%. This finding indicated that either CH3OH was consumed during a secondary reaction or additional ethanol was produced via side reactions. To examine the possibility of CH3OH consumption, control experiments were conducted with 0.6mmol CH3OH as the starting material at 135°C and 30bar H2 using 200mg of each catalyst; these conditions are similar to those used during formate hydrogenolysis. No CH3OH was consumed during the control trials, indicating that CH3OH was stable once produced in the reaction system. Interestingly, CO2 was also observed during the ester hydrogenolysis experiments and its selectivity was comparable to the difference between the CH3OH and C2H5OH selectivities. It is plausible that the excess ethanol was produced via hydrolysis of the formate (Eq. (2)). Water was a contaminant in the 1,4-dioxane solvent according to the product specification (100ppm H2O), which resulted in ∼0.04mmol of H2O in the reactor system, while the CO2 was produced in the amounts of 0.04–0.46mmol for the ethyl formate hydrogenolysis experiments (Table 2). This calculation suggested that additional water may have come from moisture in the air to balance the amount of CO2 production. This was not surprising given the hygroscopic nature of 1,4-dioxane. Based on our previous investigations, any formic acid produced during formate hydrolysis would be rapidly converted to CO2 (Eq. (3)) under the conditions used in the present work [40]. Meanwhile, the amount of CO2 is always equivalent to the ethanol produced from the hydrolysis (Eq. (2)). Therefore, formic acid is most likely the source of CO2; a similar pathway was also suggested by Braca et al. [22]. For one reactant (ethyl formate) with two pathways (hydrogenolysis and hydrolysis) to a common product (ethanol), the selectivity for that product should be 50% as was observed for most of the catalysts. Small amounts of CH4 and methyl formate were also produced over the Mo2C-based catalysts, possibly due to formic acid hydrogenation (Eq. (4)) and/or transesterification (Eq. (5)), respectively. (1) HCOOC2H5 +2H2 →CH3OH+C2H5OH,ΔG°=−38kJ/mol,ΔH°=−122kJ/mol (2) HCOOC2H5 +H2O→HCOOH+C2H5OH,ΔG°=20kJ/mol,ΔH°=−6.8kJ/mol (3) HCOOH→CO2 +H2,ΔG°=−48kJ/mol,ΔH°=16kJ/mol (4) HCOOC2H5 +CH3OH→HCOOCH3 +C2H5OH,ΔG°=−7.1kJ/mol,ΔH°=−26kJ/mol (5) HCOOH+3H2 →CH4 +2H2O,ΔG°=−179kJ/mol,ΔH°=−237kJ/mol On a gravimetric basis, catalysts containing Mo2C were the most active, outperforming the oxide supported catalysts, including the Cu-Cr catalyst, by a significant margin. In fact, the bulk Mo2C catalyst exhibited the highest rate although its selectivity to CH3OH (27%) was moderate. The deposition of Cu onto this catalyst improved its selectivity to 41% (the maximum selectivity is 50% based on the reaction stoichiometry). The Cu-Cr, Cu-Zn-Al, Cu-Zr, and Mo2N catalysts possessed moderate activities, while the other catalysts, including the Nano-Cu catalyst, exhibited low activities. Interestingly, the Cu/C catalyst was inactive, possibly due to limited formate adsorption on the carbon support, as was suggested by Braca et al. for a Re/C catalyst [22]. Where possible, the rates were also normalized by the surface areas and Cu loadings in order to define more intrinsic activities. When normalized by their BET surface areas, rates for the Nano-Cu as well as the Cu-Cr and Cu-Zn-Al catalysts were the highest. The results make sense as the measured total surface areas should be close to the active Cu surface areas for these catalysts, given their relatively high Cu composition. For the other catalysts with lower Cu loading (∼5wt%), the active species surface area may only account for a small portion of the total surface area, therefore, the surface area normalized rates were smaller. When normalized by the Cu content, all of the supported catalysts yielded rates that are significantly higher than that for the Nano-Cu catalyst, indicating that Cu is a key active species and its dispersion is critical. The highest rates, when normalized by Cu contents, were achieved for the Mo2C- and Mo2N-based catalysts. This result was not unexpected given that Mo2C and Mo2N were active without Cu. When considering the Cu catalysts, the support appeared to have a significant effect on selectivity, as illustrated by results listed in Table 2. The Cu/Mo2C and Nano-Cu catalysts demonstrated high methanol selectivities (>40%); selectivities for the Cu-Zn-Al, Cu-Cr, and Cu/SiO2 catalysts were moderate (∼30%) and the Cu/Mo2N, Cu/ZrO2 and Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalysts yielded relatively low selectivities (<10%). Differences in selectivities for these catalysts could be a consequence of the activity or lack of activity for the support. Monti et al. reported, based on results from deuterium labeling studies at ∼145°C, that methyl formate hydrogenolysis over a Cu/SiO2 catalyst involved the adsorption of methyl formate on SiO2 via the carbonyl group and the dissociation of H2 on the Cu particles [47]. Hydrogen can then be added to the adsorbed formate sequentially to produce methanol as shown in Fig. 3a. Braca et al. also reported that the SiO2 supported Re catalyst was more selective to methanol than catalysts produced from more acidic or basic supports [22]. In addition to facilitating the hydrogenolysis reaction, the support could, depending on its acidicity or basicity, catalyze hydrolysis of the formate (see Fig. 3b) [48,49]. SiO2, and Cr2O3 tend to be amphoteric and hence their hydrolysis rates should be low. γ-Al2O3 is relatively acidic and is known to catalyze hydrolysis reactions [50]. ZrO2 and ZnO are relatively basic and would facilitate the hydrolysis reaction [51]. The Mo nitrides and carbides have been reported to possess moderate acidity and/or basicity depending on the synthesis and treatment conditions [52,53] and would also catalyze the hydrolysis of ethyl formate. Temporal variations in the reaction rates were consistent with first order kinetics with respect to ethyl formate (R 2 ≥92%). The first order dependence on formate is consistent with reports by Monti et al. regarding the kinetics for liquid phase methyl formate hydrogenolysis at 135–200°C [9]. We used the following equation to determine the pseudo first order rate constants, k obs: (6) r h = k obs ⋅ C formate where r h =rate of hydrogenolysis [mol/L/gcatal/s] based on the formation of methanol, k obs =pseudo first order rate constant [ g catal − 1 ⁡ s − 1 ] and C formate =the average concentration of formate [mol/L]. Because the concentration of H2 was in significant excess of stoichiometric (∼5.3mmol based on its solubility in 1,4-dioxane at 135°C, 30bar [43]), the H2 concentration term was embedded in the rate constant. Based on k obs, hydrogenolysis activities for the catalysts decreased as follows: 5Cu/Mo2C>Mo2C>Cu-Cr>Cu-Zn-Al≈Nano-Cu>Cu/SiO2 ≈Cu/γ-Al2O3 ≈Cu-Zr>3Cu/Mo2N≈Mo2N≈Cu/C=0 (Table 2). As the Cu/Mo2C catalyst exhibited the highest reaction rates and selectivities, additional experiments were carried out with this material. Fig. 4 shows the reactant and product distributions as a function of reaction time and Fig. 5 shows the Arrhenius plot. The apparent activation energy (E A ) for ethyl formate hydrogenolysis to methanol was 44±3kJ/mol. Evans et al. reported a value of 48kJ/mol for a commercial Cu-Cr catalyst in a comparable temperature range (130–170°C) [17]. Given results for the Cu/Mo2C catalysts, we synthesized Mo2C supported Pd and Pd-Cu catalysts. Palladium has been reported to be active for ester hydrogenolysis [21]. Table 3 lists the reaction rates and selectivities for the Mo2C supported Pd and/or Cu catalysts. Interestingly, the surface area normalized rates for the Mo2C catalyst and for these metal/Mo2C materials were very similar, ranging from 5.4 to 6.2μmol/m2/h at 135°C. Given the significant variations in the metal loading, this observation suggested that Pd, Cu and Mo2C possessed similar intrinsic activities for formate conversion. While the rates were similar, products formed during formate conversion changed significantly when Pd and/or Cu were deposited onto the Mo2C support. Fig. 6 compares selectivities for the catalysts after 8h on stream. The methanol selectivity was lowest for the Mo2C catalyst and increased with increases in the Pd and/or Cu loading. These results are consistent with Pd and Cu facilitating hydrogenolysis over the Mo2C catalyst perhaps via a pathway similar to that proposed by Monti et al. for Cu/SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 3a) [47]. Mo2C still differs from other oxide supports in that it is an active species for ester hydrogenolysis itself. As all the Mo2C-based materials were synthesized without surface passivation and used in an oxygen-free environment, minimal amount of molybdenum oxide species should be involved in the reaction. In comparing the 5Cu/Mo2C and 5Pd/Mo2C catalysts, one could conclude that Pd is a slightly more effective promoter than Cu. This could be a consequence of differences in the inherent properties of the metals or differences in their dispersions; this will be explored in future experiments."
7,Conclusions,"Research described in this paper demonstrated that Mo2C-based catalysts are catalytically active for the low temperature (<150°C) hydrogenolysis of ethyl formate to methanol. This reaction is a key step in the production of alcohols and in the cascade hydrogenation of CO and CO2 to methanol. Other products, including CO2 and minor amounts of CH4 and methyl formate, are also formed, implicating several side reactions (e.g., ethyl formate hydrolysis, formic acid decomposition and transesterification). The reaction rates were adequately fit to a first order model with respect to ethyl formate; over the best-performing catalyst (1Pd-5Cu/Mo2C) the rate constant was 4.6 × 10 − 4 g catal − 1 ⁡ s − 1 . The selectivity to methanol appears to be a strong function of the acidity/basicity of the support. The catalysts with amphoteric or weakly acidic/basic supports generally yielded higher methanol selectivities than those for catalysts with strong acidic/basic supports. Materials with strong acid/base sites likely catalyzed the hydrolysis reaction, producing substantial amounts of CO2. The deposition of nanoscale Cu and/or Pd particles onto the Mo2C significantly enhanced the catalytic performance, yielding high conversion rates and methanol selectivities approaching 50% (as opposed to 27% for the Mo2C catalyst). The enhancement in CH3OH selectivity is likely a consequence of synergy between the metal and support. These catalysts are excellent candidates for use in cascade catalytic systems for the one-pot synthesis of methanol via CO or CO2 hydrogenation as well as other types of ester hydrogenolysis reactions."
