0,Introduction,"Hydrogen-producing granules with an excellent settling ability have been cultivated in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating a synthetic sucrose-rich wastewater in our previous study. The physicochemical characteristics of the H2-producing granules have been well elucidated [1]. In another work, the feasibility of employing a granule-based UASB reactor for long-term continuous H2 production has been explored [2]. In order to further understand the H2-producing UASB reactor, it is essential to develop a model to quantitatively describe the reactor performance. There are two ways to quantitatively describe the performance of a UASB reactor: mechanistic model and black-box model. They are based on a different philosophy and have their specific characteristics [3]. Based on qualitative understanding of the UASB process gained over the years, attempts have been made to develop mechanistic models for UASB reactors [4–6]. However, these mechanistic models are unable to completely explain or predict the performance of a UASB reactor under various input conditions. This is primarily attributed to the several shortcomings in the mechanistic models currently available: the inability of the models to accurately represent the substrate availability to microorganisms; excessive simplification of biochemical dynamics in the reactor; simplistic consideration of the relationship between reactor performance, biomass retention, and specific gas production and the role of sludge retention mechanisms [6]. Therefore, establishment of a black-box model for predicting the granules-based H2-producing UASB reactor performance seems to be attractive. A genetic algorithm (GA) and neural network (NN) model might be a promising choice. NN is a powerful tool for approximation of unknown nonlinear functions and has gained wide applications in a variety of fields [7]. GA is a class of parallel iterative and global search algorithm with certain learning ability, which repeats evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation after initialization until the stopping condition is satisfied [8]. A GA–NN model has been developed to evaluate an antibiotic fermentation process [9] and to optimize a fermentation medium for the production of the enzyme hydantoinase by Agrobacterium radiobacter [10]. However, such a GA–NN model is not available to a granule-based H2-producing UASB reactor. Therefore, this study was thus carried out to establish and apply a GA–NN model to simulate the performance of such a H2-producing reactor. The GA–NN model was designed, trained, and validated to predict the steady-state reactor performance. The results might be useful for understanding the granule-based H2-producing UASB process and thus could provide valuable information for a better control and operation of H2-producing reactors."
1,GA–NN model,"GA and NN are combined to form a new model to simulate the performance of a H2-producing reactor (Fig. 1 ). The searching mechanisms of the hybrid GA–NN model can be briefly described as follows: First, as approximate models of the practical problem, NN are constructed with initial connection weights based on a collection of training samples. Secondly, the GA is employed to explore good solutions among solution space. Once a new solution is generated by the GA, the NN will be used to determine its fitness value for the GA and continue its searching process. Finally, after the stopping criterion of the GA is satisfied, the best solution will be given by the GA and its performance will be determined by detailed evaluation based on actual problems."
2,Materials and methods,"Data for training and validating the GA–NN model were obtained from the two laboratory-scale granule-based H2-producing UASB reactors treating sucrose-rich synthetic wastewater with different reaction volume. One reactor with a reaction volume of 2.0l was used to train the GA–NN model, while another of 4.0l was employed to validate this model. Detailed information about the reactor, seed sludge, feed solution, and analytical methods can be found in our previous paper [2]. The GA–NN model described in this study was implemented in Matlab 7.0 and run under the Microsoft Windows XP environment. In the GA–NN model, the training coefficients ( R T 2 ) and validating coefficients ( R V 2 ) of determination were respectively, defined as (1) R T 2 = 1 - ∑ ( y i - y i T ) 2 ∑ ( y i - y ¯ ) 2 , (2) R V 2 = 1 - ∑ ( y i - y i V ) 2 ∑ ( y i - y ¯ ) 2 , where y i is the actual value of output i, y ¯ is the actual average value of output i, y i T is the training value of output i by GA–NN model, and y i V is the validating value of output i by the GA–NN model."
3,Results and discussion,
4,Training and validating of the GA–NN model,"4.1 Training and validating of the GA–NN model A total of 140 experimentally derived data sets were used in this study. Each data set consisted of three input variables, i.e., organic loading rate (OLR), hydraulic retention time (HRT), and influent bicarbonate alkalinity (BA), and 10 corresponding output variables, i.e., H2 concentration in the biogas, H2 production rate, H2 yield, and total organic carbon (TOC), acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, caporate in the reactor effluent. Of these data sets, 100 data sets were used for training the GA–NN model, whereas 40 data sets were employed for model verification. Sets of input variables used to train and validate the model are shown in Fig. 2 . The comparison between the experimental values for H2 concentration in the biogas, H2 production rate, H2 yield, and effluent TOC, and corresponding values obtained by training the model is shown in Fig. 3 . For the sake of better evaluation of the results, a line of unit slope has been drawn. The values of training determination coefficients ( R 2 ) for H2 concentration in the biogas (0.966), H2 production rate (0.810), H2 yield (0.882), and effluent TOC (0.920) demonstrate that the NN learned the relationship between input and output well. The validating coefficients of determination for H2 concentration in biogas (0.719), H2 production rate (0.806), H2 yield (0.843), and effluent TOC (0.854) suggest that the trained GA–NN model showed no systematic over- or under-prediction with regard to output variables. Therefore, the model was appropriate to predict the output of the H2-producing UASB reactor. In the H2-producing UASB reactors, VFA and alcohols were simultaneously produced as main aqueous products. The main VFA included acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, caporate, and the main alcohol was ethanol in the effluent of two UASB reactors. The high training and validating coefficients of determination in Table 1 indicate that the GA–NN model was able to simulate the main aqueous products of the H2-producing UASB reactors well."
5,Prediction with the validated GA–NN model,"4.2 Prediction with the validated GA–NN model The UASB reactor performance, such as formation of products, is likely to be determined by the OLR and HRT of the reactor [11]. On the other hand, in previous studies about fermentative H2 production, butyrate was found as the dominant aqueous product. In an anaerobic H2-producing sequencing batch reactor, butyrate accounted for 65.0–71.5% of aqueous products [12]. Butyrate was in a range of 31.2–45.6% of total VFA/alcohols in a H2-producing reactor from sucrose using a mixed culture [13]. However, caproate- and valerate-type fermentations were also found to be important in the H2-producing UASB reactor [2]. Therefore, it was important to predict the change trends of VFA and ethanol, especially caproate and valerate under varying input conditions. 4.2.1 Reactor performance at various substrate concentrations The prediction to the variations in the steady-state H2-producing reactor performance at an HRT of 10h and influent BA 1000mg/l (as CaCO3), in terms of H2 concentration in the biogas, H2 production rate, H2 yield, and effluent TOC, as a function of substrate concentration, is shown in Fig. 4 . The validated GA–NN model predicted that substrate concentration had a negative effect on both H2 concentration in the biogas and H2 yield (Figs. 4(a) and (c)), but that it had a positive influence on both H2 production and effluent TOC (Figs. 4(b) and (d)). As shown in Figs. 5 (a) and (b), the validated GA–NN model predicted that both acetate and propionate concentration increased with an increase in substrate concentration. The substrate concentration in a range of 7–10g-COD/l had a significantly positive effect on the butyrate concentration. The valerate concentration increased significantly with an increase in substrate concentration in a range of 8–27g-COD/l (Fig. 5(d)). Fig. 5(e) shows that substrate concentration had a positive impact on the formation of caproate. The ethanol concentration increased significantly with increasing substrate concentration in a range of 7–20g-COD/l. The predicted results also imply that substrate concentration with a higher value than 27g-COD/l had an inhibition on the formation of VFA and ethanol, e.g., on the degradation of substrate. Therefore, the suitable substrate concentration was essential for better controlling the granule-based H2-producing UASB reactor. 4.2.2 Reactor performance at various HRTs Fig. 6 shows the prediction of variation in the steady-state H2-producing reactor performance, in terms of H2 concentration in the biogas, H2 production rate, H2 yield, and effluent TOC, as a function of HRT, with substrate concentration of 10g-COD/l and influent BA 1000mg/l as CaCO3. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the H2 concentration in the biogas changed slightly with HRT in the range of 3–30h, at a level of 45%, while it decreased sharply when HRT < 3 h . This implies that a lower HRT (e.g., < 3 h ) might result in an operation failure for a granule-based H2-producing UASB reactor. Fig. 6(b) shows a negative effect of HRT on the H2 production rate, i.e., H2 production rate decreased with an increase in HRT. However, the H2 production rate decreased sharply when the HRT was increased from a lower value to 20h, whereas it decreased slightly when the HRT was further increased to a higher level. This result suggests that it was crucial to precisely control the HRT of H2-producing UASB reactor, especially when HRT < 20 h . A positive effect of HRT on the H2 yield was predicted, as shown in Fig. 6(c). The H2 yield increased quickly when the HRT was increased from a lower level to 20h, and then it changed slightly as the HRT was further increased. The highest H2 yield, 1.40mol-H2/mol-glucose, was located at an HRT of 20h. This further indicates the significance of precisely controlling the reactor HRT. The validated GA–NN model also predicted that the effluent TOC concentration increased slightly with increasing HRT, as shown in Fig. 6(d). Fig. 7 shows the effect of HRT on the concentrations of VFA and alcohols, at a substrate concentration of 10g-COD/l and influent BA 1000mg/l as CaCO3. The validated GA–NN model predicted that the concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, and caproate had the same change trend with increasing HRT, e.g., they increased to a highest value with the increase in HRT, and then declined as the HRT was further increased. However, as shown in Fig. 7(f), the ethanol concentration reduced slightly with an increase in HRT."
6,Evaluation of the GA–NN model,"At present, mechanistic models about CH4-producing UASB reactor are available. However, so far no mechanistic model about H2-producing UASB reactor has been established, attributed to the complexity of fermentation products in the UASB reactor and its hydrodynamics. In this study, the developed GA–NN model is an empirical one, but it has the ability to map nonlinear relationships without prior information about the H2-producing UASB reactor. The advantages of the GA–NN model over mechanistic model are the simultaneous identification of structure parameters as well as the ability to “learn” and adapt by examples."
7,Conclusions,"This study demonstrates that it is feasible to apply a GA–NN model to simulate the performance of the granule-based H2-producing reactor under various input conditions. The validated GA–NN model predicted that substrate concentration had a negative effect on H2 concentration in the biogas and H2 yield, however, it had a positive influence on H2 production and effluent TOC. The H2 concentration in the biogas changed slightly with HRT in a range of 3–30h, while it decreased sharply when HRT < 3 h . A negative effect of HRT on the H2 production rate was observed, whereas a positive influence on the H2 yield was predicted by the validated model. The effluent TOC concentration increased slightly with increasing HRT. Substrate concentration in a certain range had a positive impact on the concentrations of VFA and ethanol. The concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, and caproate all increased to a highest value with an increase in HRT, and then declined as the HRT was further increased. The ethanol concentration reduced slightly with an increase in HRT. The simulated results also indicate that the suitable substrate concentration and HRT were essential for better controlling the granule-based H2-producing UASB reactor. A lower HRT ( < 3 h ) or/and a higher substrate concentration ( > 27 g-COD/l ) might result in an operation failure for a granule-based H2-producing UASB reactor."
