0,Introduction,"Currently, more than 90% of hydrogen is used in the chemical industry, such as in the production of ammonia and methanol [1]. The demand for renewable alternative energy sources is increasing due to the serious environmental problems caused by the direct combustion of fossil fuels. As an excellent energy storage medium, hydrogen is regarded as a strong candidate for clean and sustainable energy [2,3]. The application of hydrogen has many advantages, such as high efficiency, low emissions and low noise. Therefore, the demand for hydrogen as a clean and sustainable fuel will increase in the future [4]. Most hydrogen (approximately 96%) is produced through natural gas reforming, the petroleum industry and coal gasification [5].These methods are economical but result in large amounts of CO2 and pollutant emissions, and a higher operating temperature is only suitable for centralized large-scale production [6]. Water electrolysis can produce pure hydrogen at a lower temperature, but the energy consumption of this process is high because of the sluggish kinetics of oxygen release reaction [7,8]. To reduce the power consumption, researchers have carried out research on carbon-assisted water electrolysis (CAWE), which reduces the electrical energy input by partially using the chemical energy of carbon sources, such as coal [9,10], alcohols [11–13] and biomass [14,15]. Coal electrolysis was first proposed by Coughlin and Farooque [16–18], and the reactions involved are as follows: (1) Anode reaction: C(s) + 2H2O(l) → CO2(g) + 4H + 4e− (2) Cathode reaction: 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2(g) (3) Total reaction: C(s) + 2H2O(l) → CO2(g) + 2H2(g) The theoretical standard potential of the above reaction is only 0.21 V, which is much lower than that of 1.23 V for water electrolysis, which means that hydrogen production from coal electrolysis has more thermodynamic advantages. The electricity consumption of coal electrolysis can be reduced by 50% compared with water electrolysis, and the remaining energy comes from the chemical energy in coal particles [7]. Coughlin and Farooque observed that coal electrolysis occurs at 0.7–0.9 V, which is close to the theoretical potential of Fe2+. Subsequent studies [19–22] also showed that the current of coal electrolysis is mainly due to the oxidation of Fe2+ leached from the coal and that coal particles mainly undergo indirect oxidation. The reactions between the solution and the electrode are summarized as follows: (4) In the solution: 4Fe3+ + C + 2H2O → 4Fe2+ + CO2 + 4H+ (5) Anode reaction: Fe2+ → Fe3+ + e− (6) Cathode reaction: 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2(g) Although coal electrolysis has many thermodynamic advantages, the kinetics of carbon electro-oxidation are very slow, and it is difficult to meet the needs of actual production. Therefore, many studies have been conducted to improve the reaction rate. Botte et al. [23,24] studied the performance of precious metal electrodes and carbon fiber electrodes loaded with precious metals on coal electrolysis. Pt-Ir electrodes performed best among those used in the experiment, with a maximum CO2 Faraday current efficiency of 24%. The energy consumption of coal electrolysis at 0.8 V was 22 Whg−1 H2, which reduces the energy input by 52% compared to traditional hydrogen production (46 Whg−1 H2) by water electrolysis. Subsequently, researchers developed a variety of new electrocatalysts for coal electrolysis, such as nano Ti/TiO2-Pt [25], Ti-supported metal oxides [26,27], PtFe/CFs [9] and PtCo/CFs [2]. However, the oxidation mechanism of coal electrolysis is still unclear due to the complex structure and oxidation process of coal. Jin et al. [28,29] studied the kinetics of coal electrolysis at medium temperature and improved the reaction rate of coal electrolysis under temperature conditions of 80–108 °C. The results showed that coal particles cannot be oxidized without any catalytic components in the solution. The authors postulated that coal particles undergo an electro-oxidation process in electrolysis, and a six-step mechanism was proposed. Yin [26] studied the influence of different solution catalysts on coal electrolysis, such as Fe3+, K3Fe(CN)6, KBr and V2O5. The results showed that Fe3+ performs best among these solution catalysts, and the redox of the liquid catalyst acts as a bridge between coal particles and anode. Gong et al. [10] and Kou et al. [30] both studied the influences of inherent minerals on coal electrolysis. A comparison of the electrolytic characteristics of raw coal and demineralized coal showed that some inherent minerals were transformed into corresponding metal ions in the electrolyte, thereby improving the electrolytic oxidation reaction of the organic structure of coal. However, the strengthening effect of alkali/alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) on coal electrolysis was only observed at a high voltage (2 V), which is not conducive to reducing the energy consumption for hydrogen production. Few studies have been performed on the characterization of coal after electrolysis. De Abreu [31] characterized coal particles after electrolysis at different temperatures. The electro-oxidation activity of coal increases with increasing temperature. The illite, siderite and carbonate films formed after electrolysis seem to be responsible for the loss of coal activity. In addition to increasing the reaction temperature, other effective ways of improving coal activity should also be studied. The coal gasification industrial process produces a large amount of organic wastewater with complex components, high pollution, and difficult treatment. Wastewater-assisted coal electrolysis can utilize the energy of organic matter in wastewater, and the complex composition of wastewater may also help to improve coal activity. In our previous work [32,33], we studied the co-electrolysis of wastewater and coal for the production of hydrogen; this work provided new ideas for increasing the reaction rate. Among the eight types of organic wastewater from coal chemical process, coal gasification gas washing water (GWW) exhibits the best performance. However, the interaction of wastewater, coal particles and catalyst particles during the electrolysis process is still unclear. It is therefore necessary to further explore the changes in the basic properties and surface structure of coal particles after electrolysis. In this study, the role of gas washing water in coal electrolysis and the mechanism of its promotion under low voltage are studied based on a PEM electrolysis cell. This paper mainly solves the following problems through electrochemical testing and characterization. (1) Evaluate the electrochemical performance and anode reaction of gas washing water and explore whether there is an interaction between gas washing water and the solution catalyst (iron ion). (2) Determine the role of gas washing water in coal electrolysis and its mechanism of promoting coal electrolysis. (3) Evaluate the changes in the oxygen-containing functional groups before and after reaction under different initial conditions."
1,Experimental,
2,Samples,2.1 Samples The coal used in the experiments was from Shenhua Group. The particle size and composition analysis of coal are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 . The gas washing water used in the experiment was the wastewater produced during the gas washing step of the coal water slurry gasification process. The main pollutants of GWW are shown in Table 2 . The reagents used were all analytical-grade from Sinopharm Group.
3,Experimental equipment and methods,"2.2 Experimental equipment and methods Two types of electrolytic cells were used in the experiment to measure polarization curves and potentiostatic performances. Electrolytic cell A was an H-type glass electrolytic cell. Sulfuric acid was used as the electrolyte, the concentration was 1 mol/L. The volumes of the anolyte and catholyte were both 50 ml, and the counter electrode and working electrode were both pure platinum sheets (10 mm × 10 mm). More details were described in a previous publication [32]. Electrolytic cell B was a PEM electrolytic cell composed of four plexiglass plates and PTFE gaskets, and each plate was 60 mm × 60 mm × 15 mm. The counter electrode and working electrode were both pure platinum sheets (20 mm × 20 mm). The volume of the electrolyte was maintained at 200 ml; the electrolyte was placed in an oil bath at 75 °C and circulated at 60 ml min−1 with the help of a peristaltic pump."
4,Characterization methods,"2.3 Characterization methods The concentration of Fe2+ and Fetotal (the sum of the concentrations of Fe2+ and Fe3+) in the solution was measured by spectrophotometry. According to the Beer-Lambert law, the concentration is proportional to the absorbance within a certain range. Standard solutions containing 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 60, and 100 mmol L−1 Fe2+ were prepared. Acetic acid/sodium acetate with a pH of 4.6 was used as a buffer solution, and a 1% mass concentration of o-phenanthroline solution was used as a indicator. The absorbance of the standard solution was measured with a spectrophotometer (UV-2600, China), and the result is shown in Fig. 2 . The absorbance peak was at 510 nm, and the value of absorbance at the peak was linearly fitted to the corresponding concentration to obtain the Fe2+ concentration-absorbance standard curve. In the range of 2–60 mmol L−1, the fitted curve is Abs = 0.00632 + 0.02188[C], and the correlation coefficient is 0.9998. For Fetotal, excess hydrogen amine hydrochloride was added to the solution to ensure that the trivalent iron was completely reduced to divalent iron. Subsequently, the absorbance test was performed to obtain the sum of the ferrous and ferric concentrations. The organic structure of the coal surface was characterized by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The oxygen-containing functional group content was described by the correction area between the following bands [34–39]: C=O (1680–1800 cm−1); C–O (1000–1500 cm−1); C=C (1500–1600 cm−1), and –OH (3000–3600 cm−1)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Electrolysis performance of GWW,"3.1 Electrolysis performance of GWW To study the interaction mechanism of GWW and coal, it is necessary to grasp the electrolysis characteristics and anode reaction of GWW. The experiment was carried out in electrolytic cell A at 40 °C, the total concentration of Fe3+ and Fe2+ was maintained at 50 mmol/L. 3.1.1 Interaction between GWW and Fe3+/ Fe2+ In our previous work, chloride ions in GWW promoted the mass transfer of coal particles, but the interaction between GWW and Fe3+ was not clear [32]. To study whether there is an interaction between GWW and Fe3+/Fe2+, the polarization curves of GWW with and without Fe3+/Fe2+ were measured (Fig. 3 ). The results showed that the polarization curves of GWW and GWW + Fe3+ almost overlapped, indicating that the addition of Fe3+ has no effect on the electrolysis characteristics of GWW, and Fe3+ cannot catalyze the oxidation of the components in GWW. The addition of Fe2+ at different concentrations resulted in a new initial potential at 0.72 V, which was attributed to the oxidation of Fe2+ (Fig. 3b). In summary, the addition of Fe3+/Fe2+ did not change the initial potential of GWW (0.85 V, 1.1 V, 1.7 V), indicating that Fe3+/Fe2+ does not significantly affect the oxidation of the components in GWW. Fig. 6b also got the same result. Therefore, Fe3+/Fe2+ was not added when studying the anode reaction of GWW. 3.1.2 Anode reaction of GWW The polarization curves of GWW at different temperatures were measured, and the apparent activation energy was calculated according to the Arrhenius equation [40]. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . The current density increased gradually as the temperature increased. There were three peaks (23.4, 17.0 and 12.3 kJ mol−1) for the activation energy near voltages of 0.85 V, 1.1 V and 1.7 V, respectively, with increasing potential, and the correlation coefficients were all above 0.97. The three peaks of activation energy were consistent with the initial potentials in Fig. 4, indicating that the anode reaction changed at these three potentials. The peak at 1.7 V was attributed to the water decomposition reaction, which is observed at this high potential because of the high overpotential of the OER. The anode reaction types at 0.85 V and 1.1 V were further studied below. Potentiostatic experiments were performed on GWW at different potentials, and the anion concentration and COD of the anolyte before and after electrolysis were analyzed (Fig. 5 and Table 3 ). The current densities of the GWW at 1.0 V and 1.1 V were relatively low. There was almost no change in the anion concentration in the anolyte after 10 h of electrolysis, but the COD dropped to 2760 and 2710 mg L−1, indicating that the anode reaction at these two voltages was primarily the electro-oxidation of organic matter in GWW. Therefore, the peak activation energy near 0.85 V was attributed to the reaction of organic matter. Similar to the electro-oxidation of coal, the kinetics of the electro-oxidation of organic matter were also very slow, and the corresponding apparent activation energy value was relatively large. The current density of GWW was greatly improved at 1.2 V, and the concentration of bromide ions in the anolyte dropped from 6400 mg L−1 to 5300 mg L−1 after electrolysis, indicating that the anode reaction at this voltage was as follows: (7) 2Br−→Br2 + 2e− The theoretical potential of reaction (7) at 40 °C is 1.07 V; therefore, the peak activation energy at 1.1 V should be attributed to the oxidation of bromide ions. A potentiostatic experiment at 1.4 V further verified this conclusion. After electrolysis, the concentration of bromide ions in the anolyte was low er than the detection limit, indicating that most of the bromide ions were completely oxidized. At the same time, the COD of GWW dropped to 2140 mg L−1 at a voltage of 1.4 V, indicating that the organic matter in GWW was further oxidized, and the organic matter in the wastewater can be used as a resource at a lower voltage. However, the current density of GWW dropped rapidly during electrolysis. The current density of GWW dropped from 32.6 mA cm−2 to 3.5 mA cm−2 after 10 h of electrolysis, indicating that the electrolysis of GWW cannot achieve the stable production of hydrogen, and the electric oxidation of coal is still needed as the main anode reaction."
7,Effect of GWW on coal electrolysis,"3.2 Effect of GWW on coal electrolysis The electrolysis characteristics of wastewater coal slurries (referred to as GCWS) were studied using electrolysis cell B at 75 °C. The total concentration of Fe3+ and Fe2+ was maintained at 50 mmol L−1, the coal concentration was 75 g/L. The blank sample was also a sulfuric acid solution. 3.2.1 Polarization experiment Polarization experiments were carried out on coal water slurries (CWS) and wastewater coal slurries (GCWS) with and without Fe3+/Fe2+. The polarization curves were scanned after the solution temperature reached 75 °C and stabilized for 5 min (Fig. 6). The results indicate that the initial potential of GCWS was 0.75 V and reached current plateau at 0.9 V. The current density of CWS was always lower than 1 mA cm−2. After adding Fe3+, the initial potential of CWS was 0.84 V and reached current plateau at 0.94 V. The current density of the GCWS continued to rise at 1.1 V due to the oxidation of bromide ions in the GWW, as noted in the conclusion of section 3.1.2. Therefore, the oxidation of coal particles should be studied at 0.8–1.1 V. The current density of the CWS at 0.8–1.1 V was always low (0.6 mA cm−2) when Fe3+ was not added, indicating that it is necessary to add solution catalysts to increase the oxidation rate of coal particles. After Fe3+ was added, the initial potential of the CWS was 0.84 V, and the current density increased to 2.7 mA cm−2 after stabilization. The main anode reaction is the indirect oxidation of coal catalyzed by Fe3+ (reactions (4) and (5)). For the GCWS, the main reaction in anode solution at 0.8–1.1 V was the oxidation of coal and organic matter in GWW. The current density of the GCWS at 0.8–1.1 V was 1.6 mA cm−2 when Fe3+ was not added, which indicates that GWW itself does not significantly affect the oxidation of coal particles, the interaction of GWW and coal does not contribute to additional current. After adding Fe3+, the current density of the GCWS (6.7 mA cm−2) was significantly increased compared to the CWS with added Fe3+ (2.7 mA cm−2). Section 3.1.1 shows that Fe3+ does not affect the oxidation of organic matter in GWW, the interaction of GWW and Fe3+ also does not contribute to additional current. Therefore, similar to CWS, the current density of GCWS also mainly comes from the indirect oxidation of coal particles, GWW can enhance the catalysis of Fe3+, thereby increasing the oxidation rate of coal. The polarization curves of GCWS with various additions of Fe2+ are shown in Fig. 6b. The initial potentials of all samples were approximately 0.75 V, and the polarization curve of GCWS at 0.8–1.1 V almost coincided with the blank sample with the same Fe2+ content, which further illustrates that the main reaction on the anode surface is the oxidation of Fe2+ (reaction (5)). The oxidation of components in GWW can be ignored and that the coal particles mainly undergo indirect oxidation. 3.2.2 Potentiostatic performances To further study the mechanism of how GWW promotes coal electrolysis, potentiostatic experiments were performed on the CWS and GCWS at 1.1 V. After electrolysis, the anolyte was suction-filtered, and the concentrations of Fe3+/Fe2+ and COD in the solution were measured (Fig. 7 and Table 4 ). The current densities of the CWS and GCWS without the addition of iron were less than 1 mA cm−2 after 10 min and are not listed in the table. Fig. 7a shows that the current density of CWS and GCWS both had the trend of increasing first and then decreasing gradually, and there was a good consistency. The conclusion in Section 3.1.2 also shows that the current density of GWW was very low at 1.1 V (less than 1 mA cm−2 after 1 h of electrolysis), therefore the increase of the current density of GCWS comes from the oxidation of coal particles in the anode solution rather than the oxidation of components in GWW. In addition, the current density of the GCWS was approximately twice that of the CWS, which indicates that GWW can promote coal oxidation. Section 3.2.1 shows that GWW increases the oxidation rate of coal by promoting the catalysis of Fe3+. There are two pathways for its promotion: one is to promote the electro-oxidation of Fe2+ on the anode surface (reaction (5)), and the other is to promote the oxidation of coal particles in solution (reaction (4)). Similar to the polarization curve (Fig. 6b), the current densities of the GCWS and the blank sample with the same Fe2+ content were almost the same in the initial stage of electrolysis (Fig. 7b, less than 10 min). This feature shows that GWW has no obvious promotion effect on the electro-oxidation of Fe2+ but promotes the reaction rate of Fe3+ and coal particles in the solution. The current densities of experiments I, II and V all gradually increased to the highest value during the first hour of the electrolysis process, indicating that the concentration of Fe2+ in the solution gradually increased during the initial stage of electrolysis. This may be due to the process of “adsorption-reaction-desorption” that occurs when Fe3+ oxidizes coal particles. In the initial stage of electrolysis, the Fe2+ generated on the surface of coal gradually increases in concentration due to desorption, and the current density gradually increases. Subsequently, as the passive film on the surface of coal gradually forms, the oxidation rate and current density of coal gradually decrease [31]. Table 4 shows that the total iron concentration error of the blank sample before and after electrolysis was less than 2%, and the theoretical charge was very close to the actual charge, indicating the accuracy of the measurement results. The results of experiments VII and VIII show that coal particles leach a small amount of iron ions and COD into the anode solution; these ions mainly come from minerals on the surface of coal particles, such as pyrite [41]. After electrolysis, the total iron concentration in the CWS was reduced by approximately 10% (experiment I), indicating that some iron ions were adsorbed on the surface or in the pores of the coal particles, and that these iron ions did not easily desorb, reducing the effective iron concentration in the anolyte. The total iron concentration and Fe2+ concentration of the GCWS after electrolysis were both higher than those of the CWS (experiments II, V and VI), indicating that GWW promotes the catalytic effect of Fe3+ in two ways. The first is that GWW promotes the desorption of iron ions, thereby increasing its reaction rate with coal particles. The second is that GWW reduces physical adsorption and increases the effective iron ion concentration in the solution. Eventually, it promotes the formation of Fe2+ and increases the current density of the coal electrolysis process."
8,Changes of oxygen-containing groups before and after electrolysis,"3.3 Changes of oxygen-containing groups before and after electrolysis To further explore the role of GWW in coal electrolysis, the oxygen-containing groups of the coal before and after electrolysis in Table 4 were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, and the results are shown in Fig. 8 . The number of oxygen-containing groups of coal after acid leaching was greater than that of raw coal. Similar phenomena have also appeared in some researches on coal demineralization [42,43]. This difference is due to the dissolution of minerals, which exposes more oxygen-containing groups [10,30,44]. The relative content of oxygen-containing groups in the GCWS after acid leaching was greater than that of the CWS (samples VII and VIII), indicating that the coal particles expose more oxygen-containing groups under the action of GWW. This may be because the bipolar organic matter in GWW was adsorbed on the surface of coal particles, which enhances the hydrophilicity of coal particles [45] and promotes the dissolution of minerals on the coal surface, thereby exposing more oxygen-containing groups. After electrolysis, the content of oxygen-containing functional groups of CWS increased (samples I and VII), and the gradual accumulation of oxygen-containing groups was one of the reasons for the decrease in coal reactivity [40]. The difference is that the oxygen-containing groups of GCWS decreased (samples II and VIII). Since the coal anode electrolysis process is divided into two steps [46]: surface oxide formation and CO2 generation, it shows that the components in GWW contribute to the further oxidation and shedding of oxygen-containing functional groups, thereby enhancing the reaction activity of coal particles. This result corresponds to the fact that the actual charge of the GCWS shown in Table 4 was higher than that of the CWS."
9,Conclusions,"In this paper, the electrochemical performance and anode reaction of GWW and GCWS were studied using polarization technology and constant-potential experiments. The interaction of GWW, coal particles and Fe3+/Fe2+ during the electrolysis process was explored, and the conclusions were as follows. (1) There are three types of anode reactions with increasing voltage that occur with GWW. The organic matter in GWW begins to oxidize at a voltage of 0.85 V, bromide ions begin to oxidize at 1.1 V, and the water decomposition reaction begins at 1.7 V. The addition of Fe3+/Fe2+ has almost no effect on the electro-oxidation of GWW, and there is no obvious interaction. (2) The main reaction on the anode surface during the electrolysis of coal is the oxidation of ferrous ions. The rate of direct electro-oxidation of coal on the anode surface is very low or even negligible. Coal particles mainly undergo indirect oxidation catalyzed by iron ions. (3) The effect of GWW on coal electrolysis is mainly manifested in two ways. On the one hand, it promotes the “adsorption-reaction-desorption” process of iron ions while reducing the physical adsorption of iron ions by coal particles, thereby increasing the effective iron concentration in the solution, promoting the generation of ferrous ions and increasing the oxidation rate of coal. On the other hand, the bipolar organic matter in GWW is adsorbed on the surface of the coal particles to improve the hydrophilicity of the coal particles, thereby increasing the reaction activity of the coal particles in the solution. This increase in reaction activity is manifested macroscopically as the current density, that is, the hydrogen production rate.
