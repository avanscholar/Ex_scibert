0,Introduction,"Aldehydes and ketones are prepared from alcohols through selective oxidation processes in industries. High purity of aldehydes preparation is till major concern for researchers at low cost. Conventionally, we produced benzaldehyde from toluene, benzyl chloride by gas/liquid phase, and hydrolysis respectively which produce the hazardous organic waste. The overall cost of this conversion is increased because of the low selectivity and lack of conversion and also it produces toxic by-products. To overcome these limitations researchers used liquid-phase selective oxidation using metal oxide catalyst in presence of various oxidants. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a very good oxidizing agent as well it is eco-friendly in nature and also it has more active oxygen content. Homogeneous catalysis has its own limitation such as difficulty to separate the catalyst from the catalytic system and it can’t be reused. Hence, the synthesis of eco-friendly and inexpensive heterogeneous catalysts has gained more interest in researchers [1–3]. The activity of the catalysts can be further improved by support materials. The selective oxidation of alcohols supported by polymers which was studied by many researchers and extensively reviewed by Mahmoud Nasrollahzadeh et al. [65–70]. Ordered mesoporous silica is thought to be an excellent catalyst support due to its high surface area and well-defined pore size [4–9]. The metal catalysts such as Ru [10–12], Co [13], Au [14–16], and Pd [17] in many catalytic reactions. Recently SBA -15 supported Au-Pd catalyst was utilized for the catalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol [18–20]. However, the noble metals are very expensive and they also agglomerate on the support surface, and it increases the cost of oxidation processes [21]. Though, the platinum catalysts are considered as better oxidation catalyst compared to palladium. This is due to the formation of stable oxide (palladium oxide) and as a result it shows catalytic properties semiconductor metal oxide instead of metal catalytic properties [22]. Pt/CeO2 is an excellent choice because of its excellent chemical stability and potential applications in catalysis [23], which has been extensively used in photocatalytic CO2 reduction [24–26], photocatalytic water splitting [27–29], and photocatalytic hydrogen production [30–33]. Cerium oxide have gotten a lot of interest due to their outstanding catalytic performance, which result from a fast and efficient transformation of the oxidation state across Ce3+ and Ce4+. The cerium atom can quickly and dramatically change its electrical arrangement to better suit its immediate surroundings [34]. Recently, Pt/CeO2 was chosen as a support for Au-Pd nanoparticles [35], or catalyst/photocatalyst in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol [36–40]. Also, Pt/CeO2 was used as a photocatalyst using SBA-15 as support [41]. Though, most of the above reactions are carried out photo catalytically. Xiaodong Zhang et al. synthesized MnO2, CeO2 and Mn-Ce composite oxides catalysts and tested in toluene oxidation and CO oxidation reactions [42–45]. The selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the liquid phase using Pt/CeO2 using SBA-15 still needs to be explored. The catalytic performance of Pt/CeO2 catalyst is associated with the size of the particles, the nature of the support, and the interaction between the Pt/CeO2 catalyst and the support. In the present study, we have synthesized Pt/CeO2-SBA-15 catalysts, utilization for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH). From a catalytic point of view, the parameters affecting the efficiency of the oxidation such as metal loading, catalyst amount, reaction temperature, and substrate to oxidant ratio were investigated extensively. In addition, the recycling performance of the catalyst was investigated."
1,Experimental details,
2,Preparation of support and catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of support and catalysts According to previous report platinum doped SBA-15 catalysts were prepared in an acidic medium [46]. The Pt/CeO2-SBA-15 loaded SBA-15 was prepared in the following way. Add 4 g P123 (triblock co-polymer (Mol. Wt. 5800)) to 130 ml H2O and 20 ml HCl. Stir until complete dissolution and add 14 ml TEOS. Then, the approximate amount of chloroplatinic acid was added and stir for 7.5 h at 45 °C. Ageing for 15.5 h at 80 °C (without stirring) and cool down. Filter and wash the precipitate with 25 ml of water and dry. In post-synthesis, the final product calcined at 550 °C during 6 h with a heating rate of 1 °C/min in the ambient atmosphere. Cooling down occurs slowly. The synthesized SBA-15 was dried at 100 °C and calcined at 550 °C. CeO2 (5–20 wt%) was deposited over calcined SBA-15 by a homogeneous urea hydrolysis method. In a typical synthesis (for 10 wt% CeO2), 4.0 g of calcined SBA-15 has immersed in120 ml of distilled water containing 1.8820 g of Cerium nitrate (Ce(NO3)3, Aldrich) and1.332 g of urea. The mixture was heated with stirring at 90 °C for 5–6 h, and the resultant mixture was filtered and washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove chloride ions. The filtered CeO2-SBA was dried in air and at 110 °C for 24 h followed by calcination in air at 550 °C for 6 h. Pure CeO2 was prepared by adding a solution of the Cerium nitrate salt dropwise to a well-stirred 2 M ammonium hydroxide solution at room temperature. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 9–10 and refluxed at 100 °C for 4 h. The precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water several times until the pH was close to neutral. The product was calcined at 550 °C for 5 h. All the synthesis catalysts were then impregnated with chloroplatinic acid by the incipient wetness method. The amount and concentration of Pt-solution were adjusted to obtain 0.5 wt% of Pt in the final catalyst. Then the resulting mixture was dried in an air oven at 100 °C for 12 h, and calcined at 400 °C for 4 h in static air. To obtain the reduced form of Pt, the catalysts were treated in a hydrogen flow at 200 °C for 1 h. The reduction was done in situ in the reactor before the start of the reaction. The synthesized samples SBA-15, Pt/CeO2(5%)-SBA-15, Pt/CeO2(10%)-SBA-15, Pt/CeO2(15%)-SBA-15 and Pt/CeO2(20%)-SBA-15 were marked as SBA-15, PCS-5, PCS-10, PCS-15 and PCS-20 respectively."
3,Characterization of Pt/CeO2 supported on SBA-15 catalyst,"2.2 Characterization of Pt/CeO2 supported on SBA-15 catalyst Crystallographic studies were carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Miniflex II) where Cu Ka was used as a radiation source. The functional group present in the catalyst was identified using Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR, Perkin–Elmer). Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument was utilized to calculate the surface area and pore volume of the prepared catalyst. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) pictures of the samples were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 instrument. TEM pictures of the samples were obtained using a JEOL instrument (JEM 2010)."
4,Catalytic activity in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"2.3 Catalytic activity in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol The oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH – 20 mmol) was carried out over 0.1 g of various 0.5% Pt and CeO2 catalysts (PCS-5, PCS-10, PCS-15, and PCS-20) in a batch reactor (round bottom flask with Liebig condenser and temperature controller) with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP – 25 mmol) as the oxidant and acetonitrile (10 ml) as the solvent under atmospheric pressure condition. The above mixture was heated at 100 °C for 7 h. The products were identified by using a gas chromatograph equipped with an SGEBPX70 capillary column (70% Cyanopropyl Polysilphenylene Siloxane) with dimensions of 30 m (length) × 0.54 mm (internal diameter) × 0.60 µm (film thickness) and flame ionization detector. Nitrogen is used as a carrier gas. The optimization of the process parameters for maximizing BzOH conversion and benzaldehyde (BzH) selectivity was done by investigating the influence of the variation in reaction parameters, such as metal loading (5–20%), catalyst amount (0.00–0.15 g), reaction temperature (50–110 °C) and TBHP/BzOH ratio(0.25–2.00) using the most active sample, Pt/CeO2(15%)-SBA-15. This sample was also investigated for reusability [47]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical and spectroscopic characterization,"3.1 Physicochemical and spectroscopic characterization 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) Fig. 1 displays the wide-angle XRD patterns of CeO2, and Pt/CeO2-SBA-15 samples (PCS-5, PCS-10, PCS-15 and PCS-20) respectively. It should be noted that pure CeO2 has a crystalline structure, whereas SBA-15 is amorphous in nature which is confirmed from a broad peak is noticed around at 2θ = 23°. Whereas, the supported catalysts also do not show any crystalline phases even at higher loading of Pt/CeO2 (20%). The absence of crystalline phases might be because CeO2 is uniformly distributed even at higher loading of CeO2. The formation of both tetragonal anatase and tetragonal rutile phase of CeO2 was confirmed by comparing the XRD pattern with JCPDS datas and matches well with the JCPDS Card Nos. 21-1285 (Anatase) and 21-1276 (Rutile) with a space group of I41/amd and P42/mnm respectively. Also, the XRD pattern of CeO2 matches well with the previously reported literature [48]. The crystal planes corresponding to diffraction peaks (2θ) of anatase and rutile phases were indexed and displayed in Fig. 1. From the XRD result, it is concluded that Pt/CeO2 was successfully synthesized and loaded on SBA-15. Fig. 2 showing the small-angle XRD spectra of the prepared catalysts, SBA-15, PCS-5, PCS-10, PCS-15, and PCS-20 respectively. The diffraction lines (100) (110) (200) are clearly indicating that the synthesized catalysts are mesoporous in nature. No shifting peaks occurred but when the platinum loading has increased, the intensity of the peaks is decreased. This might be due to the addition of CeO2 coated on the surface of the catalyst. Hence, the crystalline nature is lost with more addition of Pt/Ce. Also, there is a limited increase in the disordered structure of SBA-15 after the addition of platinum in SBA-15. XRD result concludes that the hexagonal structure of the SBA-15 was maintained even after the higher loading of platinum [49]. 3.1.2 BET surface area analysis Nitrogen adsorption analysis was carried out on all the prepared samples SBA-15, PCS-5, PCS-10, PCS-15 and PCS-20 respectively. Table 1 shows the textural properties of the prepared sample. The surface area and pore volume of the SBA-15 reduced from 756.22 m2/g to 444.30 m2/g and 0.880 cm3/g to 0.422 cm3/g. This might be due to the addition of Pt/CeO2 coated on the surface of the catalyst. Hence, the total surface area and mean pore diameter are lost with the increasing amount of Ce [50]. All isotherms explain typical type IV features. Mesopores texture of the catalyst is largely maintained its indicates by the H1-type hysteresis loop. Fig. 3 showing the hysteresis of nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. Also, there is a large tail presence and shrink in pore volume it may be because of fractional blockage of pores or else due to the clustered formation of metal phase in the mesopores texture of the catalyst [51]. 3.1.3 FT-IR analysis FT-IR spectra were recorded taken to characterizing the formation of Pt/Ce species in the mesoporous silica framework. FT-IR spectrum of SBA-15 and titanium-supported SBA-15 samples (PCS-5, PCS-10, PCS-15, and PCS-20) was shown in Fig. 4 . In all spectra, the bands at 3512 and 1642 cm−1 due to the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group present on the surface of the catalyst. The peak at 1071 cm−1 is attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of Si-O-Si. Theoretically, the infrared band observed at 910–960 cm−1 might be assigned to the Ce–O–Si stretching vibration [51]. The observed peak at 470 cm−1 corresponds to the vibration of Pt-O-Ce. From the results, we infer that Si–O-Ce-Pt linkage is present in the catalyst [52]. 3.1.4 TEM-analysis TEM micrographs of SBA-15, PCS-5, PCS-10, PCS-15 and PCS-20 are shown in Fig. 5 A–E. TEM image clearly shows that the SBA-15 sample has a highly ordered mesoporous structure and the structure was retained even after the addition of Pt/CeO2 (20%) [53]. From the TEM results, it is confirmed that CeO2 was incorporated into the mesoporous structure successfully without destroying the framework and catalyst morphology [54]. The ordered structure was slightly distorted at higher loading of Pt/CeO2 (15%) on SBA-15 and considerably distorted after 20% loading of Pt/CeO2, which is clearly seen from the TEM image of Fig. 5D and E respectively. In conclusion, the addition of Pt/CeO2 (20%) significantly affects the morphology. 3.1.5 SEM–analysis The surface morphology of the SBA-15, PCS-5, PCS-10, PCS-15 and PCS-20 was determined by scanning electron microscopy. SEM images of SBA-15, PCS-5, PCS-10, PCS-15 and PCS-20 are shown in Fig. 6 A–E. SEM images clearly show that as-synthesized samples have agglomerated tubular-like morphology [55]. The tubular morphology having a size of about 5–10 µm. However, the agglomerated tubular-like morphology is made up of a large number of nano-sized particles. This is concluded from the rough surface of the morphology. The size of the nanoparticles is in the range of 200–300 nm. The agglomerated decreases with increasing CeO2 content. This might be beneficial for better adsorption and higher catalytic activity [56–61]."
7,Catalytic activity of SBA- 15 and Pt/CeO2/SBA-15 catalysts on the benzyl alcohol oxidation,
8,Effect of metal loading,"4.1 Effect of metal loading The Fig. 7 shows the comparison of catalytic activity of SBA-15, PCS-5, PCS-10, PCS-15 and PCS-20 catalyst with different metal loading percentages. The amount of Pt/CeO2 atoms incorporated in the mesoporous catalyst determines the acidic strength of the catalyst [62]. Hence, the effect of metal loading on SBA- 15 catalysts in the conversion of BzOH has been studied. The SBA-15 sample shows only a 30% conversion of benzyl alcohol. The conversion of benzyl alcohol increases to 55, 73, and 99% by increasing the metal amount from 5 to 15%. On the other hand, the selectivity of benzaldehyde is unaffected. Hence, the increasing metal content should further increase the conversion. However, the conversion of benzyl alcohol considerably decreases to 96% with a very small decrease in the selectivity of benzaldehyde (99%) is observed. The decrease of catalytic activity at Pt/20 %CeO2/SBA-15 is because the excess amount of CeO2 creates a crowd among Pt and CeO2 and as a result the benzyl alcohol conversion decreases [63]. Hence, the 15% loaded Pt/CeO2/SBA-15 (PCS-15) is chosen as an ideal catalyst to proceed with further studies."
9,Effect of catalyst weight,"4.2 Effect of catalyst weight The PCS-15 catalyst was taken in the range of 0.02 to 0.1 g to optimize the effect of catalyst amount on the conversion of BzOH. Fig. 8 clearly indicates in the absence of the catalyst the conversion of BzOH is very low (10%). When we add catalyst in the range of 0.02–0.08 g into the catalytic system the conversion rate is increased from 42% to 99%. The low catalytic activity for 0.02 and 0.04 g catalysts are due to availability of lesser number of catalytic active sites. The availability of the active sites on the catalyst is increases by increasing the catalyst weight and as a result, it improves the activity of the reaction [64]. As expected the conversion and selectivity increases with increasing catalyst amount from 0.04 to 0.08 g. When the catalyst weight was increased further from 0.08 to 0.10 g, the BzH selectivity was decreased from 100 to 98%. Also, insignificant decreases in conversion (99%) is observed when we increase the catalyst amount to 0.10 g. It was proposed that the BzOH act as an inhibitor for the conversion of benzaldehyde to benzoic acid. The inhibition effect is decreased when the conversion of benzyl alcohol reaches ∼90%. Furthermore, all the catalyst active sites are not accessible by reactant molecules due to the excess amount of catalyst hinder some catalytic active sites. Hence, the selectivity of benzaldehyde decreases when a 0.1 g amount of catalyst is used [65–67]. There is remarkable improvement between 0.08 g and 0.1 g of catalyst amount. Hence, we conclude that 0.08 g of catalyst is optimum for maximum conversion and selectivity from the results."
10,Influence of the reaction temperature,"4.3 Influence of the reaction temperature The conversion of BzOH is greatly influenced by the reaction temperature. We evaluate the effect of temperature at various temperatures from 50 to 110 °C. Fig. 9 shows that the conversion increased from 38 to 99% when the temperature is raised from 50 to 90 °C. Furthermore, the conversion of benzyl alcohol decreases with increasing temperature beyond 90 °C and reaches 89% conversion at 110 °C. The low conversion of benzyl alcohol at 50 and 60 °C are due to the temperature strongly impact on the controlled kinetic reaction. Whereas, the benzyl alcohol conversion as well as selectivity of the benzaldehyde is reduced by increasing temperature beyond 90 °C (90% at 110 °C). Because of the inhibition effect BzOH is lost when the benzyl alcohol conversion reaches ∼90% as stated before. Also, at higher temperature the benzaldehyde converted into benzoic acid. The experimental results indicate that 90 °C is optimum for maximum conversion of BzOH [68]."
11,Influence of substrate to oxidant ratio,"4.4 Influence of substrate to oxidant ratio The molar ratio of the substrate and oxidant play a vital in the selectivity of benzaldehyde and conversion of the BzOH. We examined the TBHP:BzOH ratio in the range of 0.25–2.00. Fig. 10 displays the influence of TBHP/BzOH molar ratio on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The percentage of conversion is increased from 23% to 99% when we increase the molar ratio from 0.25 to 1.25. Even at TBHP:BzOH ratio 1.0, the low conversion of benzyl alcohol is attributed by after 80% conversion the ability of oxidation of TBHP decreases. The aforementioned results demonstrate that increasing the TBHP concentration considerably improves the conversion of benzyl alcohol [69]. In order to increase the conversion, the TBHP:BzOH ratio increases beyond 1.25. Not surprisingly, the conversion of benzyl alcohol reaches 89% when TBHP:BzOH ratio is 2.00. Also, the selectivity of benzaldehyde drastically decreases to 80%. This might be because of the presence of a large volume of oxygen throughout the decomposition of TBHP, which readily oxidizes benzaldehyde into benzoic acid. In conclusion, lower amount of TBHP have low conversion and higher amount of TBHP leads to further oxidation. The experimental results show that 1.25 is the optimum TBHP:BzOH ratio for ideal BzOH conversion and BzH selectivity."
12,Recyclability studies,"4.5 Recyclability studies For industrial application catalyst stability and reusability is a very important tool. The stability of the PCS-15 catalyst was tested in the optimized (conditions: BzOH – 20 mmol, PCS-15 catalyst – 0.08 g, TBHP – 25 mmol, CH3CN – 10 ml, 90 °C, time 7 h) and the result was presented in Table 2 . After completion of the reaction, the catalyst is removed from the reaction mixture by the filtration method. The recovered catalyst was rinsed with ethanol and dried in a hot air oven at 110 °C. The BzOH conversion is decreased from 99% to 90.2% after the seventh cycle and the selectivity also declined from 109% to 94.5%. The selectivity and conversion are slightly declined after the seventh cycle due to catalyst loss during the recovering processes. From the experiment, we conclude that Pt/CeO2(15%)-SBA-15 is an excellent catalyst for the BzOH conversion [70–74]. The above catalyst can be used at the industrial level because of ease of preparation, the better yield of product, economic process, reusability, and recyclability of catalyst up to 7 cycles. Fig. 11 A–C shows the characterization (low angle XRD, BET, and TEM) of the reused Pt/CeO2(15%)-SBA-15 catalyst. It was found that the catalyst structure and morphology is maintained after used in reaction which is confirmed by XRD and TEM analysis. The total surface area and pore volume slightly decreases from 549.50 m2/g and 0.508 cm3/g to 541.22 m2/g and 0.501 cm3/g. This might be due to the strongly adsorbed reactant and/or product inside the support of the pores [75–79]."
13,Comparative catalytic activity,"4.6 Comparative catalytic activity The comparative of catalytic activity study was reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, catalyst, metals, conversion, and selectivity for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol formed in%, and the recycles. The literature comparison for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol by CeO2 catalysts is tabulated in Table 3 . The interestingly distinguished that the catalyst recognized in the current study was not only capable of activity but also remains superior to other reported catalysts. Additionally, the reaction temperature is comparatively lower than the other reactions. Almost all of the reactions require higher temperature [80]."
14,Conclusion,"The mesoporous SBA-15 with various wt.% of Ce (5–20%) and 0.5% Pt were successfully synthesized. The as-synthesized Pt/Ce(5–20)-SBA-15 loaded SBA-15 were characterized by many characterization techniques. The results confirmed the formation of Pt/CeO2 and its successful loading on SBA-15. The Pt/CeO2-SBA-15 catalysts were evaluated in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol conversion. The PCS-15 catalyst found optimum conversion and product selectivity. This might be because the synergistic interaction between Pt and CeO2 is stronger in PCS-15 than in the other catalysts synthesized in this work. At optimized conditions (Catalyst amount – 0.15 g; reaction temperature – 90 °C; TBHP:BzOH ratio – 1.25), the PCS-15 catalyst showed a BzOH conversion of 98% and BzH selectivity of 99% respectively. The recycling performance of the PCS-15 catalyst was tested up to 7 cycles and found the catalytic performance was retained until 7 cycles. Compared to expensive metal catalysts, this CeO2 loaded SBA-15 catalyst is economic and efficient from the industrial point of view. The PCS-15 not only superior in the present reaction and it is also found better compared to other CeO2 based catalysts which was reported in the literature based on the conversion, selectivity and reaction temperature."
