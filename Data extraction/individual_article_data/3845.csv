0,Introduction,"Among all the pollutant gases in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide plays a special role due to the magnitude of the emissions generated by human activities involving the combustion of carbonaceous fuels, principally wood, coal, oil, and natural gas [1,2]. CO2 chemistry has become a very attractive area of research not only because of environmental concerns but also due to the potential use of CO2 as an alternative and economical feedstock [2–4]. Conversion of carbon dioxide as a renewable C1 feedstock to value-added compounds (e.g., methane, methanol, CO) has attracted considerable attention due to its significance in the chemical industry, geopolitics, and carbon recycling within the Earth ecosystem [2–4]. However, this is a difficult task due to the difficulties associated with the chemical activation of CO2 [4]. Usually, the chemical conversion of the extremely inert CO2 involves its catalytic activation by transition metal catalysts with multiple redox states [2]. This article reports the transformation of CO2 to CO, methanol, and methane using novel catalysts generated by depositing small particles or clusters of Cu, Au, and Ni on a well-defined TiC(001) surface. Transition metal carbides exhibit broad and amazing physical and chemical properties [5,6]. These properties may be viewed as resulting from a combination of those of covalent solids, ionic crystals, and transition metals [5,7]. As compounds, the metal carbides are less ionic than the metal oxides [7]. Since the 1970s, it is known that some transition metal carbides (TMCs) can display a chemical behavior reminiscent of that of platinum and other transition metals such as Pd, Ru, or Rh during the transformation of hydrocarbons [8,9]. Thus, they perform well as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysts [6,9] and display remarkable activity in hydrotreatment processes of oil-derived feedstocks [10–13]. Metal carbides with a carbon/metal ratio below one can be quite aggressive toward CO2 easily breaking its C–O bonds [9]. On the other hand, carbides with a higher content of carbon such as TiC and MoC do not destroy the CO2 molecule [14,15]. Furthermore, the TMCs also seem to be excellent supports for the dispersion of metals [14–17]. Catalysts prepared by depositing noble metals on metal–carbide surfaces display a high activity for CO oxidation, desulfurization, and hydrogenation reactions [15]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and first-principles periodic density functional (DF) theory-based calculations have been used to study the interaction of metals of Groups 9, 10, and 11 with MC(001) (M=Ti, Zr, V, Mo) surfaces [15]. In many of these systems, there is a preferential formation of admetal-C bonds with significant electronic perturbations in the admetal. Thus, XPS spectra and the results of DF calculations for Cu/TiC(001) and Au/TiC(001) point to the existence of strong admetal↔Csurface interactions that induce changes in the electronic structure of small copper and gold particles [18,19]. Fig. 1 displays electron localization function (ELF) plots for Cu4 and Au4 on TiC(001) [16,20]. The ELF maps show that there is a substantial concentration of electrons located in the region outside the supported Cu4 and Au4 clusters. The magnitude of the electron polarization is somewhat larger for Au4. It is also important to note that in addition to the electron polarization evidenced by the ELF plots, a Bader analysis of the charge density finds a charge transfer from the TiC substrate to the metal atoms in Cu4 and Au4 [18–20]. Images of STM show a two-dimensional→three-dimensional transition in the structure of the Cu and Au nanoparticles when the admetal coverage on TiC(001) goes above 0.1ML with a disappearance of the electron polarization [15]. On the basis of the charge polarization induced by the carbide substrate, one can expect significant differences between the chemical properties of small admetal particles and the bulk surfaces of Cu and Au [16,18,19]. Indeed, the experimental and theoretical data discussed below show an enhancement in the catalytic activity of Au, Cu, and Ni deposited on TiC(001) with respect to Au(100), Cu(100), and Ni(100). The admetals in contact with TiC are excellent catalysts for the reverse water–gas shift (CO2 +H2 →CO+H2O) reaction and are able to transform CO2 into methanol."
1,Experimental and theoretical methods,
2,Surface characterization and catalytic tests,"2.1 Surface characterization and catalytic tests The M/TiC(001) samples {M=Au, Cu, or Ni} were studied in a system, which combines an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber (base pressure ∼5×10−10 Torr) and a batch reactor [21–24]. The sample could be transferred between the reactor and the UHV chamber without exposure to air. The UHV chamber (base pressure ∼5×10−10 Torr) was equipped with instrumentation for X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS and UPS), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). The TiC(001) single crystal was cleaned following methodologies reported in the literature [16,25]. Gold, copper, and nickel were vapor-deposited on the TiC(001) surface at 300K. The admetal dosers consisted of a resistively heated W basket with a drop of ultrapure Au, Cu, or Ni inside [16,22,26]. Initially, the flux of each doser was calibrated by taken thermal desorption spectra for the desorption of Au, Cu, or Ni from a Mo(100) substrate [16,27]. This information was then used to calibrate admetal coverages estimated by means of XPS. In the tests of CO2 activation/hydrogenation, the sample was transferred to the reactor at ∼300K, and then, the reactant gases, 0.049MPa (0.5atm) of CO2 and 0.441MPa (4.5atm) of H2, were introduced, and the sample was rapidly heated to the reaction temperature (500, 525, 550, 575, and 600K) [23,24]. In many industrial applications, very high reactant pressures (1–5MP) are used for the synthesis of methanol by CO/CO2 hydrogenation [28]. The seals of our batch reactor could not hold such elevated pressures, and we have studied reactant pressures comparable to those employed in previous studies with model catalysts [28]. It is remarkable that the catalysts investigated in this study were able to produce significant amounts of methanol at reactant pressures in the range 0.49MPa (5atm). Product yields for the hydrogenation of CO2 (CH3OH, CO, H2O, CH4) were analyzed by a mass spectrometer and/or a gas chromatograph [28]. In the case of the reverse water–gas shift, we saw the simultaneous production of CO and water, but for simplicity, only the production of CO will be reported as typically done in this type of studies [28]. The sample holder was passivated by extensive sulfur poisoning (exposure to H2S) and had no catalytic activity [23,24,28]. The amount of molecules produced in the catalytic tests was normalized by the active area exposed by the front of the sample. The TiC(001) crystal was initially passivated with H2S, and then, its front was cleaned by ion sputtering before depositing the admetals (Au, Cu, and Ni) and performing the catalytic tests. The reported rates for methanol and methane synthesis and for the reverse water–gas shift reaction correspond to steady-state conditions determined by plotting the yield of CO, methanol, and methane molecules versus the reaction time [28]. In our experiments, data were collected at intervals of 15min up to total reaction times of 270min. The kinetic experiments were done in the limit of low conversion (<5%)."
3,First-principles Density Functional Theory-based calculations,"2.2 First-principles Density Functional Theory-based calculations The adsorption and hydrogenation of CO2 on Au/TiC(001) and Cu/TiC(001) model systems were also studied by means of calculations based on Density Functional Theory, within the usual Kohn–Sham formalism, carried out for suitable periodic representations of these systems. The Perdew–Wang implementation (PW91) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) has been chosen for the exchange-correlation potential [29]. The effect of the atomic cores on the valence electron density has been taken into account by means of the projected augmented plane-wave (PAW) method of Blochl [30] as implemented by Kresse and Joubert [31] in the VASP code [32,33]. This representation of the core states allows one to obtain converged results with a cutoff kinetic energy of 415eV for the plane-wave basis set. The Monkhorst–Pack scheme [34] has been used to select the special k-points used to carry out the numerical integrations in the reciprocal space. A conjugated gradient algorithm with an energy criterion of 0.001eV (0.02kcalmol−1) has been used for the atomic convergence, ensured forces to be in all cases smaller than 0.03eV/Å. The TiC(001) surface has been represented by slab models repeated periodically with a vacuum region of 10Å between repeated slabs. The slabs were constructed using the lattice parameter optimized for the bulk of TiC and reported in a previous work [7]. They all contained four atomic layers but different surface areas. In all cases, the two outermost layers of one side of the slab were completely allowed to relax. Cu and Au clusters of different shapes and sizes were set above the TiC(001) surface, and the vacuum space enlarged accordingly to maintain the repeated slabs enough away from each other. The metal adatoms were placed initially above C atoms [18,19]. The structure of the supported metal particles was always fully optimized allowing the two uppermost atomic layers of the TiC substrate to relax. This type of geometry optimization was also carried out in the series of calculations where the CO2 molecule and H interact with the supported Cu and Au systems. For the supported Cu and Au nanoparticles, we used a 3×3 unit cell (144 TiC+4, 9, 13, or 29 metal atoms) with a resulting coverage of 0.111ML. In each case, a suitable Monkhorst–Pack of special k-points has been used. The present models of supported Cu and Au nanoparticles are realistic enough to provide a meaningful comparison with experiment, at least for the main qualitative trends. In order to appropriately compare the chemical activity of the supported systems, DF calculations were carried out for suitable models of the Cu(111), Cu(100), Au(111), and Au(100) extended surfaces. For these surfaces, the slab was cut from the bulk using the calculated lattice parameter, a 3×3 unit cell was used with four atomic layers (36 metal atoms), and the two outermost ones were completely relaxed. In order to determine the lowest energy structures of the reactants and products of CO2 hydrogenation on Au4/TiC(001) and Cu4/TiC(001), several geometry optimization calculations were carried out starting from different starting geometries. Once the final geometries were obtained for the {H+CO2} on the Cu n /TiC and Au n /TiC(001) systems, a proper vibrational analysis has been used to characterize final geometries as minimum energy structures, and the corresponding adsorption energies calculated as follows: E ads = - [ E CO 2 ( ads on M n / TiC ) - { E CO 2 ( gas ) + E M n / TiC ( clean ) } ] where E CO 2 ( gas ) is the energy of the isolated CO2 molecule; E M n / TiC ( clean ) is the total energy of the relaxed Cu or Au/TiC(001) surface, and E CO 2 ( ads on M 4 /TiC ) is the energy of CO2 adsorbed on either Cu n /TiC(001) or Au n /TiC(001) surface. Similar calculations were carried out for the co-adsorption of H and CO2 on the M n /TiC(001) system models. Transition-state structures for the reaction between H and CO2 were located with the help of the Dimer [35] algorithm as implemented in VASP and properly characterized by vibrational analysis."

5,Kinetic tests of CO2 hydrogenation,"3.1 Kinetic tests of CO2 hydrogenation 3.1.1 Reaction on TiC(001) and Au/TiC(001) Extended surfaces of metallic gold do not interact with CO2 or molecular hydrogen. Thus, they are completely inert as catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. Clean TiC(001) binds CO2 [24] and does dissociate the H2 molecule [15,20]. We found that this metal–carbide surface is able to catalyze the following reactions (1) CO 2 + H 2 → CO + H 2 O (2) CO 2 + 3 H 2 → CH 3 OH + H 2 O with the rate of production of CO through the reverse water–gas shift reaction (RWGS) being 430–470 times faster than the rate for the synthesis of methanol. In the Arrhenius graph in Fig. 2 , the apparent activation energies for the synthesis of methanol and CO production on clean TiC(001) are 20.9 and 18.6kcalmol−1, respectively. We did not find evidence for the formation of methane or higher hydrocarbons. This implies that TiC is able to break one of the C–O bonds in CO2, but it probably does not dissociate CO. The difficult cleavage of CO on TiC(001) [36] prevents the formation of significant amounts of methane as happens for the hydrogenation of CO2 on Mo2C and Fe3C [37]. Although surfaces of metallic Au or Au nanoparticles interact poorly with CO2, the deposition of Au on TiC(001) leads to a substantial enhancement in the catalytic activity of the system for the production of methanol and CO via CO2 hydrogenation (see Fig. 2). The biggest effect is on the rate of the RWGS reaction. A TiC(001) covered with 0.1ML of Au displayed rates for CO production which were 4–7 times faster than those of clean TiC(001). In Fig. 2, the apparent activation energies for the synthesis of methanol and CO production on Au/TiC(001) are 13.2 and 10.8kcalmol−1, respectively. These values are 7–8kcalmol−1 smaller than the values found on TiC(001). Fig. 3 shows the effect of Au coverage on the catalytic activity of Au/TiC(001) for CO2 hydrogenation. The maximum activity is observed for a gold coverage of 0.1ML. Previous studies with STM have shown that at this small gold coverage, there is a large fraction of admetal particles with a high of ∼0.2nm with respect to the carbide substrate [38]. These small gold particles were two-dimensional (i.e. one single layer of gold). The drop in catalytic activity with increasing Au coverage shown in Fig. 3 seems to correlate with an increase in Au particle size [38]. When the Au coverage was increased (>0.1ML) on TiC(001), STM showed the dominant presence of three-dimensional particles of the admetal with sizes above 1nm [38]. Thus, maximum catalytic activity for CO2 activation is observed when one has two-dimensional gold particles in close contact with the carbide substrate; admetal particles which exhibit strong electronic perturbations and a charge polarization (see Fig. 1) [16,20]. 3.1.2 Reaction on Cu/TiC(001) Commercially, methanol is synthesized from syngas (CO–CO2–H2) over a Cu–ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst at 493–573K and 5–10MPa [39]. It has been shown that CO2 is the predominant carbon source for methanol under industrial conditions by means of isotope labeling experiments [40]. Previous works have performed a fundamental study of the hydrogenation of CO2 on Cu(111), Cu(100), and Cu(110) [23,41–43]. CO2 interacts weakly with copper surfaces [44,45], exhibiting a desorption temperature of 100K [45]. The adsorption of the molecule is promoted by the presence of atomic adsorbed O [45] and alkali elements [46] on the copper surface. In general, extended surfaces of copper exhibit a low activity for CO2 hydrogenation producing mainly CO with methanol as a minority product [23,41–43]. Fig. 4 shows Arrhenius plots for the production of methanol and CO on Cu(111) [23], Cu/ZnO ( 0 0 0 1 ¯ ) [23], and a TiC(001) surface pre-covered with 0.1ML of copper. The Cu(111) surface exhibits a catalytic activity for the production of methanol and CO, which is smaller than that seen for plain TiC(001) in Fig. 2. This correlates with the strength of the bonding interactions of CO2 on these surfaces, with negligible bonding on Cu(111) [23] and moderate bonding on TiC(001) [24]. We found that the addition of small amounts of copper to TiC(001) substantially improved the catalytic activity of the system. Cu/TiC(001) is a better catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation than Cu(111), TiC(001), or Cu/ZnO ( 0 0 0 1 ¯ ) . In Fig. 4, the rate for methanol production on Cu/TiC(001) is 20–90 times larger than on Cu(111). In the case of CO production, the rate on Cu/TiC(001) is 35–110 times larger than on Cu(111). Most of the surface of Cu/TiC(001) is copper free. Using the data in Fig. 2, one can subtract the activity of TiC(001) from that of Cu/TiC(001) and then estimate the turnover number (TON) of the copper sites in Cu/TiC(001). If one assumes that all the copper atoms present in Cu/TiC(001) are exposed to the gas reactants (i.e., negligible formation of three-dimensional particles for a copper coverage of 0.1ML), the TONs for the production of methanol on Cu/TiC(001) are 180–910 times larger than on Cu(111), with the TONs for CO production being 310–1330 times larger on Cu/TiC(001) than on Cu(111). There is a big reduction in the corresponding apparent activation energies when going from Cu(111) to Cu/TiC(001). A comparison of the values listed in Table 1 indicates that Cu/TiC(001) is the catalysts that exhibits the lowest apparent activation energies for the RWGS reaction and methanol synthesis. The apparent activation energy for methanol synthesis drops from 25.5kcalmol−1 on Cu(111) to 11.6kcalmol−1 on Cu/TiC(001). For the production of CO or RWGS reaction, the apparent activation energies are 21.9kcalmol−1 on Cu(111) and 8.4kcalmol−1 on Cu/TiC(001). The graphs in Fig. 3 show the effect of Cu coverage on the catalytic activity of Cu/TiC(001). Clearly, the rate of production of methanol and CO decreases when the Cu coverage increases. The synthesis of CH3OH seems the most affected with a drop of ∼50% in catalytic activity when the Cu coverage increases from 0.1 to 0.3ML. This reduction in catalytic activity may reflect an increase in the size of the Cu particles with a 2D→3D transition in the growth mode [16]. At a coverage of 0.1ML, the copper mostly forms 2D islands on the carbide substrate. The admetal atoms in these 2D islands are electronically perturbed (see Fig. 1) and can interact directly with reactants coming from the gas phase. On the other hand, for 3D particles of Cu, most of the admetal atoms exposed to the reactants are not in contact with the TiC(001) surface and, hence, exhibit the chemical properties of regular copper. The results in Fig. 3 indicate that Cu/TiC(001) is a much better catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation than Au/TiC(001). However, the enhancement of the admetal↔CO2 interactions did not lead to a cleavage of both C–O bonds in the molecule and the formation of methane. As in the case of Au/TiC(001), methanol and CO were the only products formed after passing a mixture of CO2 and H2 over the Cu/TiC(001) surfaces. The methanol seen on Cu/TiC(001) could be formed through a mechanism that involves direct hydrogenation of CO2, as happens in the case of metallic Cu and Cu/ZnO [23,28,43], or by hydrogenation of the CO formed by the RWGS reaction, as happens in the case of transition metal catalysts [47]. The copper in contact with TiC is more chemically active than regular Cu, and a very large amount of CO is formed on Cu/TiC. These characteristics favor the generation of methanol via CO hydrogenation [47]. 3.1.3 Reaction on Ni/TiC(001) Well-defined surfaces of nickel [48–50] and Ni-based catalysts [51] are active for the hydrogenation of CO2 producing methane instead of methanol as a dominant product. On Ni, the CO2 hydrogenation barrier is much smaller than on common Cu metal-based catalysts [49]. Upon adsorption of CO2 at ∼90K on Ni(110), the molecule weakly chemisorbs and undergoes a geometrical distortion, bending into a nonlinear geometry [52]. This geometrical distortion is triggered by electron transfer from the substrate to the molecule and the formation of an anionic CO 2 - molecule [52]. The CO 2 - anion-molecule reacts with adsorbed H atoms to form formate [52], a species that undergoes chemical transformations to yield methyl, methoxy, and methane moieties [49]. The addition of Ni to copper surfaces improves their ability to catalyze the CO2 hydrogenation [42,47,53]. On a Ni/Cu(100) model catalyst, it was observed that the turnover frequency for CO2 hydrogenation was 60 times higher at Ni sites than at Cu sites [42,53]. Fig. 5 shows Arrhenius plots for the production of methanol, methane, and CO on a TiC(001) surface pre-covered with 0.1ML of Ni. Although methanol is not a significant product in the hydrogenation of CO2 on Ni(100) [48] and Ni(110) [49], it does appear on the Ni/TiC(001) system. The rate of production of methanol on Ni/TiC(001) is 3.3–4.2 times bigger than on clean TiC(001). This indicates that the Ni atoms in contact with the TiC(001) surface do catalyze the transformation of CO2 into methanol. Indeed, Ni/TiC(001) is a much better catalysts for the production of methanol than Au/TiC(001), see Fig. 3. By large, the main product of the hydrogenation of CO2 on Ni/TiC(001) is CO, followed by methane, and then methanol. The apparent activation energies for the formation of the reaction products increase following the sequence: CO (8.9kcalmol−1)<methane (11.1kcalmol−1)<methanol (17.1kcalmol−1). In the case of methane, the apparent activation energy found on Ni/TiC(001) is smaller than those found on Ni(100), 21.2kcalmol−1 [48], and Ni-based powder catalysts, 14–25kcalmol−1 [48,51]. The estimated TONs for methane formation on Ni/TiC(001) are 20–290 times larger than those reported on Ni(100) [48]. On the basis of these results, we can conclude that the Ni↔TiC interactions have a beneficial effect on the ability of Ni to produce methane and methanol from CO2 hydrogenation. Figs. 3 and 6 display the effect of Ni coverage on the production of methanol, CO, and methane. For methane and CO, an increase in Ni coverage leads to a gradual decrease in the rate of production of these species. The behavior for methanol is different, with a small increase in the production of this alcohol when going from a Ni coverage of 0.1 to 0.2ML. After reaching a maximum at this coverage, the production of methanol decreases with increasing Ni coverage. As in the cases of Cu/TiC(001) and Au/TiC(001), the decrease in catalytic activity could be attributed to a 2D→3D transition in the admetal particles that reduces the number of atoms that are in contact with the carbide substrate and at the same time can interact with the reactant molecules. For a Ni coverage of 0.1ML, the system contains Ni atoms which are the most efficient for bonding to the CO2 molecule and cleaving its two C–O bonds. A comparison of the data shown in Fig. 3 for the three admetals investigated in this work indicates that Ni deposition leads to the most active catalysts for formation of CO. However, for the production of methanol, Cu/TiC is the best by far. The CH3OH/CO selectivity ratio is much larger on Cu/TiC than on Ni/TiC."
6,Bonding and activation of CO2 on Cu/TiC(001) and Au/TiC(001),"3.2 Bonding and activation of CO2 on Cu/TiC(001) and Au/TiC(001) In this section, we will use density functional calculations to obtain some microscopic insight on the bonding and activation of CO2 on Cu and Au clusters in contact with TiC(001). In the experimental studies described in the previous section, Au and Cu are the elements which undergo the largest increase in chemical activity upon interaction with the TiC substrate. Past theoretical studies have shown weakly bonding of CO2 to Ni(100) [54,55] or Ni(110) [55] with the dissociation of the molecule into CO and O being an exothermic process (ΔE =−12 to −25kcalmol−1). In contrast, CO2 does not binds to Cu(100) or Au(100), and the dissociation of the molecule is thermoneutral or endothermic [23,54]. 3.2.1 Interaction with TiC(001) and Cu/TiC(001) We will start by examining the bonding of CO2 to clean TiC(001). The top of Fig. 7 shows the optimized geometry for CO2 on TiC(001). The molecule is attached to the surface via a C–C bond with some bonding interactions between its O atoms and nearby Ti atoms. The calculated adsorption energy is −14.3kcalmol−1, small but noticeable. Thus, TiC(001) binds CO2 much better than surfaces of copper or gold [23,56], with a bonding energy that is comparable to those found on Ni(100), Ni(110), and Co(100) [54,55]. However, these metal surfaces dissociate CO well [54,55], but the dissociation of this adsorbed molecule on TiC(001) is a highly endothermic process (CO2,ads →COads +Oa, ΔE =−1.4kcalmol−1; COads +Oads →Cads +2Oads, ΔE =38.0kcalmol−1). The difficult cleavage of CO on TiC(001) prevents the formation of significant amounts of methane as happens for the hydrogenation of CO2 on Ni(100) and Ni(110) [48,49] or on carbides such as Mo2C and Fe3C [37]. The relatively high carbon/metal ratio in TiC reduces the reactivity of the Ti centers through ligand and ensemble effects [57]. The experimental data in Fig. 3 indicate that only small Cu particles in contact with TiC(001) interact well with CO2. We investigated the interaction of CO2 with different types of copper clusters supported on TiC(001): Planar Cu4 and Cu9 clusters and pyramidal clusters of the Cu13 and Cu29 type [18–20,23]. Only when the Cu atoms were in direct contact with the TiC(001) substrate, were the Cu↔CO2 bonding interactions significant. Bonding between CO2 and the second or third layer atoms in pyramidal Cu13 and Cu29 clusters was negligible. On the other hand, the planar Cu4 and Cu9 clusters bound CO2 well, with the adsorption energy dropping from −25.6kcalmol−1 on Cu4 to −13.6kcalmol−1 on Cu9. Fig. 7 shows the calculated bonding geometry for CO2 on Cu4/TiC(001). The molecule was bound to the copper atoms in a η3-C,O,O configuration. The O–C–O bond angle was reduced from 180° in gas phase to 116.7° on Cu4/TiC(001), which is reminiscent of CO 2 - , while the C–O bond lengths changed from 1.18Å to 1.29 and 1.36Å. Note that, as mentioned above, CO2 does not bind on copper surfaces. On the square Ni(100) surface, the CO2 molecule binds with a η2-C,O configuration [54,55]. In general terms, the copper atoms in Cu4/TiC(001), or Cu9/TiC(001), bound the CO2 molecule stronger than the atoms in regular surfaces of metallic copper or metallic nickel [54,55]. The experimental data in Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that Cu/TiC(001) is as excellent catalysts for the production of CO from CO2. Using DF calculations, we investigated the thermochemistry associated with a direct CO2(ads)→CO(ads)+O(ads) transformation. Fig. 8 displays the calculated structures and relevant energies for the dissociation of CO2 on Cu4/TiC(001). The direct cleavage of one of the C–O bonds in CO2 is an endothermic process (ΔE =5.1kcalmol−1) with an activation energy of 18.7kcalmol−1. However, the energy released by the adsorption of CO2 on Cu4/TiC(001), ΔE =25.6kcalmol−1, could be used to overcome the dissociation barrier in Fig. 8 and produce CO from CO2. The overall CO2(gas)→CO(ads)+O(ads) transformation is exothermic, ΔE =−20.5kcalmol−1 and, as indicated above, with a barrier of 18.7kcalmol−1. Another route for the formation of CO from CO2 involves the reverse water–gas shift reaction: CO2 +H2 →CO+H2O. In previous works, we have shown that Cu/TiC(001) can easily dissociate H2 producing a reservoir of H atoms on the surface [15,20]. The H adatoms can attack the adsorbed CO2 producing HOCO or HCOO intermediates that eventually dissociate into HO and CO. Fig. 9 shows calculated structures, changes in energy and activation energy barriers for the reaction path: CO2(ads)+H(ads)→HOCO(ads)→HO(ads)+CO(ads). The formation of a HOCO intermediate has a ΔE similar to that found for the CO2(ads)→CO(ads)+O(ads) reaction, but the activation barrier is 5.6kcalmol−1 smaller. The subsequent decomposition of HOCO into CO and OH is an exothermic reaction with ΔE =−15.4kcalmol−1 and with a very low activation barrier of 4.2kcalmol−1 only. Thus, the reverse water–gas shift, with HOCO as a key intermediate, seems the best route for the production of the CO detected in the experiments for CO2 hydrogenation on Cu/TiC(001). We also investigated the transformation of HOCO(ads) into its HCOO isomer(ads). The transformation had a ΔE of −23.6kcalmol−1 and an activation barrier of 13.5kcalmol−1. This activation energy was significantly larger than that seen in the last step of Fig. 10 . 4.2kcalmol−1 implying that a HOCO intermediate should convert into CO and OH instead of transforming into HCOO. Once formed, the decomposition of HCOO into CO and OH was an uphill process with a ΔE of 8.3kcalmol−1 and an energy barrier of 32.2kcalmol−1. In Fig. 4, methanol appears as a secondary product, and hence, we have not calculated the thermochemistry associated with the reaction pathways associated with the production of methanol. These pathways can be quite complex [23,47] and here would not bring relevant information. The usual starting intermediates for the synthesis of methanol from CO2 hydrogenation are HOCO and HCOO [23,47]. The low stability of HOCO makes this species an ideal intermediate for the RWGS, and therefore, the synthesis of methanol should occur through the hydrogenation of HCOO or the hydrogenation of the CO formed by the RWGS. The calculated difference in the stabilities of the HOCO and HCOO intermediates implies that the RWGS reaction should be much faster than the synthesis of methanol, as observed experimentally. 3.2.2 Interaction with Au/TiC(001) The DF calculations indicate that the adsorption of CO2 on Au(100) and Au(111) surfaces is an endothermic process (ΔE >4.6kcalmol−1), in agreement with trends found in experimental measurements which show no bonding of the molecule at temperatures above 100K. In contrasts, the bonding energy of CO2 on Au4/TiC(001) is 15.6kcalmol−1 although it gets smaller for a larger Au nanoparticle as in the case of the Au9/TiC(001) system for which the calculated value is 8.5kcalmol−1. In the case of Au4/TiC, the molecule was bonded to the gold clusters in a η2-C,O configuration (bottom of Fig. 7). In the case of the Au/TiC(001) systems, the bonding interactions with CO2 were not as strong as those found on the Cu/TiC(001) systems (see above), but they were not negligible. They compare well with those found on Ni(100) or Ni(110) [54,55]. The differences in reactivity shown in Fig. 3 for Cu/TiC(001) and Au/TiC(001) reflect variations in the strength of the admetal↔CO2 interactions. The energy barrier for the dissociation of H2 on Au4/TiC(001) is quite small (<3kcalmol−1) [15,20]. In the presence of H2, one can expect a sea of H atoms on the Au/TiC(001) surface. We found that OHCO again is a viable intermediate for the production of CO from CO2 through the RWGS reaction. Fig. 10 shows the calculated adsorption geometry of OHCO on Au4/TiC(001). For the CO2(ads)+H(ads)→OHCO(ads) reaction, we found a ΔE of 8.4kcalmol−1 with an activation energy of 16.2kcalmol−1. The energy released in the adsorption of CO2, −15.4kcalmol−1, could be used to push forward the formation of OHCO. Once formed, the OHCO should dissociate almost spontaneously into CO and OH (ΔE =−2.5kcalmol−1, activation energy of 1.4kcalmol−1). This dissociation prevents the transformation of OHCO into HCOO, a process that has a ΔE of −14.8kcalmol−1 and an activation barrier of 8.1kcalmol−1. The DF calculations indicate that the RWGS reaction should occur much faster than methanol synthesis, with the production of methanol probably involving the hydrogenation of a HCOO intermediate or the hydrogenation of the abundant CO generated by the RWGS. Overall, the DF calculations indicate that interactions with the TiC substantially enhance the chemical reactivity of Cu and Au toward CO2. We have not performed calculations for the bonding of CO2 to Ni/TiC(001) but it is known that Ni atoms in contact with TiC(001) are electronically perturbed [15,58]. In any case, previous experimental and theoretical studies indicate that surfaces of pure Ni interact with CO2 and cleave its C–O bonds producing CO and methane upon hydrogenation of the molecule [48–50]. In Fig. 3, Ni/TiC(001) is the best catalyst for the production of CO, but the system has problems with the methane/methanol selectivity ratio. In this aspect, Cu/TiC and Au/TiC appear to be superior catalysts."
7,Conclusions,"The deposition of small particles of Au, Cu or Ni on TiC(001) produced surfaces with a very large activity for the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. The major product over these surfaces was CO which was produced by the reverse water–gas shift reaction (RWGS, CO2 +H2 →CO+H2O). In the cases of Au/TiC(001) and Cu/TiC(001), a substantial amount of methanol was also produced but no methane was detected. On the other hand, Ni/TiC(001) produced a mixture of CO, methanol, and methane. A strong dependence was found between the catalytic activity of the admetals and their coverage on the carbide surface. The highest catalytic activity was found for small two-dimensional particles or clusters of the admetals in close contact with TiC(001). Under these conditions the catalytic activity of the supported metals was orders of magnitude higher than those of Au(100), Cu(100) or Ni(100). In addition, Cu/TiC was more active for the synthesis of methanol than a model for a Cu/ZnO industrial catalysts. CO2 adopted a η3-C,O,O bonding configuration on Cu/TiC(001), while a η2-C,O bonding conformation was seen on Au/TiC(001). The results of DF calculations point to HOCO as a key intermediate for the generation of CO through the RWGS, with the production of methanol probably involving the hydrogenation of a HCOO intermediate or of the CO generated by the RWGS. This work shows that metal carbides can be excellent supports for enhancing the ability of transition metals to adsorb and activate CO2 toward the synthesis of methanol or methane."
