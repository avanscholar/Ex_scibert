0,Introduction,"As widely acknowledged, greenhouse gases (GHG) mainly produced by the growing consumption of fossil fuels act as the main factor leading to global climate change and have been among the major global concerns [1,2]. Renewable energy carriers are considered among the leading solutions whose widespread application could reduce GHG emissions [3], mitigate global climate change [4,5], and contribute to achieving carbon neutrality in various energy-intensive sectors [6,7]. As one of the most abundant and sustainable resources, biomass has been regarded as a promising carbon-neutral feedstock for biofuels production [8–11], especially within the framework of biorefineries [12,13]. Among various biomass conversion technologies, fast pyrolysis has attracted a great deal of attention for bio-oil production [14,15]. Hence, efforts have been devoted to shedding light on various aspects of biomass pyrolysis, including applying advanced modeling techniques [16,17] and scrutinizing scaling up challenges [18]. The crude biomass-derived bio-oil contains less sulfur; however, it possesses high oxygen content (about 20–50 wt%) [19], leading to low heating value, poor stability, high corrosiveness, and viscosity [20]. Therefore, upgrading the crude bio-oil for oxygen removal is necessary for further applications in the transportation sector or chemical feedstocks [21]. Catalytic hydrotreatment is perceived as one of the most effective methods to upgrade the fast pyrolysis bio-oil to hydrocarbons as fuels or chemicals [22,23]. Hydrotreatment under the action of a catalyst can reduce the oxygen content and increase the stability and calorific value of the bio-oil through the hydrogenation or deoxygenation of olefins, oxygen-containing organic acids, ketones, alcohols, furans, and phenols contained in bio-oil [23]. The key is to develop or screen high-efficiency hydrogenation catalysts [24] to promote the conversion and removal of oxygenated compounds through selective hydrodeoxygenation catalysis [25]. Typically applied catalysts for hydrotreatment are normally divided into conventional non-noble metal catalysts that need to be presulfided, such as Co, Ni, Mo [26], Cu, W, or their bimetallic formulations such as CoMo/γ-Al2O3 and NiMo/γ-Al2O3 [27], and noble metal catalysts such as Pd, Pt, Ru, and Rh [28,29]. The latter catalysts have gained growing interest by researchers because they are highly hydrodeoxygenation active and presulfidation-free compared to conventional non-noble metal catalysts [30]. Bjelić et al. [27] studied the catalytic mechanisms of hydrodeoxygenation of model compound over supported Cu, Ni, Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh catalyst, indicating superior HDO activity for noble-metal catalysts like Ru while showing almost negligible activity for Cu. The utilization of noble metals such as Rh required lower reaction temperature or pressure and generally gained lower carbon deposition [29]. Noble-metal catalysts exhibit high levels of hydrogenation and deoxygenation, especially for oxygenated aromatic compounds such as guaiacol, phenol, vanillin, and eugenol [31]. However, the hydrogenation reaction of bio-oil is not only catalyzed by the catalyst but also affected by the complex interaction between different components in bio-oil [24,32]. Nevertheless, most current research focuses on various bio-oil derivatives [33,34], and research on hydrotreatment of crude bio-oil and high-efficiency catalysts is relatively lacking [22]. In light of the above, this work mainly focuses on the catalytic upgrading of biomass-derived bio-oil via hydrogenation. To achieve that, a supported Rh catalyst was prepared, and a lab-scale batch reactor was designed. We investigated the catalytic and regeneration performance of Rh/ZrO2 by hydrogenation experiments of a bio-oil model compound. Moreover, the catalytic effects of the developed catalyst on crude bio-oil were further studied and compared with similar commercial catalysts (i.e., Pd/Al2O3 and Rh/Al2O3). The influence of the catalysts on product yield and physicochemical properties, and the deoxygenation extent (DE, %), were also explored to provide a reference for further development of bio-oil upgrading."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Raw materials and catalysts,"2.1 Raw materials and catalysts The bio-oil model compound used in this study was guaiacol (Fluka, >99.0%), and the crude bio-oil was produced by fast pyrolysis of rice husk in a commercial-scale plant at 500 °C. Detailed information on the commercial-scale plant and the specific pyrolysis conditions for producing the rice husk bio-oil can be found in our previous reports [35,36]. The hydrogenation catalysts used in this study were supported noble-metal catalysts, including the prepared Rh/ZrO2 and the commercial Pd/Al2O3 and Rh/Al2O3. The commercial catalysts were purchased from Shaanxi Kaida Chemical Co., Ltd. (China) with a designed metal loading rate and average particle size of 5 wt% and 70 μ m, respectively. The Rh catalyst supported by zirconia (Rh/ZrO2) was prepared with an aqueous solution of Rh(NO3)3 by incipient wetness impregnation technique based on our previous study [31]. The ZrO2 support is a commercial one provided by MEL Chemicals (ECO100, 0.25–0.42 mm) and was calcined at 700 °C before impregnation. The ratio of metal precursor solution and the calcined ZrO2 support was calculated according to the target value of the Rh metal loading. For the preparation of 10 f of 0.5 wt% Rh/ZrO2 via the incipient wetness impregnation method, the detailed formulation of ZrO2 support and Rh(NO3)2 precursor is shown in Table 1 ."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization The physicochemical properties of Rh/ZrO2 and commercial catalysts were investigated and characterized with N2-physisorption (Micromeritics Instrument Corp., ASAP 2460) for the BET-surface area [29]. SEM images were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (Sirion 200 SEM) to determine the effect of testing conditions on the catalyst surface. The actual metal loading was measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) [37]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Rh metal were acquired using a monochromatic source (1486.6 eV) with a spectrometer (Kratos Axis Ultra DLD, Shimadzu) [38]. The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) of Rh/ZrO2 and commercial catalysts were performed using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer. Samples for NH3-TPD (0.1 g) were firstly degassed at 300 °C in Argon (Ar, 99.999%) at the flow rate of 40 mL/min for 120 min, then cooled to 50 °C and saturated with ammonia (0.2% NH3/Ar) gas until saturated (120 min). After that, samples were purged in Ar flow for 60 min at 50 °C and then desorbed by heating to 800 °C at the heating rate of 10 °C/min in Ar flow at the flow rate of 50 mL/min. The NH3-TPD signals were identified via a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Samples for H2-TPR were flushed at 300 °C in He (99.999%) for 120 min and then cooled to 50 °C. After that, samples were heated up to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under the 5% H2 (50 mL/min per g precursor) flow mixed with He. The final H2 consumption was monitored by TCD. The carbon deposition of the used Rh/ZrO2 catalyst was determined with a carbon-sulfur analyzer (JB, CS996). Samples were treated in O2 at 1350 °C after washing and drying (for 24 h at 100 °C)."
4,Hydrogenation reactor design,"2.3 Hydrogenation reactor design The lab-scale batch hydrogenation reactor was made of S31603 stainless steel, with a designed volume of 150 mL. The heater's power supply (heating jacket) was configured using a 220 V grounded power supply with an adjustable heating rate of 10–25 °C/min. Its highest designated temperature was 450 °C, and that of pressure ranged from normal pressure to 12 MPa. The stirring was stepwise (0–1000 rpm). Fig. 1 shows the schematic presentation of the lab-scale batch hydrogenation reactor used in this study. The lab-scale batch hydrogenation reactor system mainly included an autoclave with spin-fixed removable catalyst basket, feed and sampling systems, online monitor, and system controller. The whole reactor was connected with seven stainless steel valves, corresponding to the numbers V.1∼V.7 in Fig. 1, to realize the process control of feeding and sampling. The online monitor and controller systems controlled and recorded the temperature, pressure, and stirring rate of each test point through thermocouples and sensors. As shown in Fig. 1, the long screw was fastened by the thread at the top to connect the rotating shaft of the stirring motor. The upper and lower discs had the same structure and diameter and could be fitted with the long screw. The catalyst basket, capable of rotating along with the rotating shaft, was fabricated by curling three stainless-steel meshes with a specific aperture into cylinders. The three cylinders were symmetrically clamped into the corresponding grooves in the upper and lower discs. The total volume of the three cylinders was the maximum catalyst volume that the catalyst basket could hold, and it could be adjusted by changing the length of the cylinders."
5,"Hydrogenation effect, repeatability, and regeneration of Rh/ZrO2","2.4 Hydrogenation effect, repeatability, and regeneration of Rh/ZrO2 To verify the hydrogenation effect and regeneration performance of the prepared Rh/ZrO2 catalyst and its possible deactivation mechanism, a typical model bio-oil compound, i.e., guaiacol (22 mL, 5 wt% dissolved in n-dodecane solvent), was used as feedstock. The catalytic hydrogenation experiment was carried out at 350 °C and 7 MPa hydrogen pressure using Rh/ZrO2 (0.22 g). The reaction time was set at 0–240 min. Hydrogenation without catalyst was used as a control. The repeatability experiments were performed with the used catalyst of the previous round of experiments under the same conditions. Before being reused, the reacted catalyst was cleaned by ultrasonic in an ethanol solvent and then dried. The used catalyst was repeatedly utilized for several experimental rounds until the conversion rate of the reactant was significantly reduced. Regeneration treatment of the deactivated Rh/ZrO2 catalyst was performed as follows: 1) cleaning the deactivated Rh/ZrO2 catalyst with ethanol solvent; 2) ultrasonic treatment in acetone solvent for 60 min to remove carbon deposit; 3) calcination in an air atmosphere at 700 °C for 120 min; and 4) reduction in a hydrogen atmosphere at 350 °C for 60 min. After that, the catalyst was reused for the hydrogenation experiment of guaiacol under the same conditions as follows: 5 wt% guaiacol, Rh/ZrO2, 350 °C, 7 MPa H2, and 240 min. Each experiment was repeated twice."
6,Hydrotreatment of bio-oil,"2.5 Hydrotreatment of bio-oil Catalytic hydrotreatment experiments of bio-oil were carried out using the prepared Rh/ZrO2 and the commercial Pd/Al2O3 and Rh/Al2O3 catalysts in the lab-scale batch hydrogenation reactor. The crude bio-oil was produced in a large-scale pyrolysis reactor with industrial significance. Ethanol (anhydrous grade, 99.5%, Sigma Aldrich) was used as the reaction solvent given its effectiveness in converting thermally-cracked lignin derivatives in bio-oil, as confirmed in previous reports [39,40]. The mass ratio of ethanol solvent to bio-oil was 1:1. Since the hydrodeoxygenation reaction started above 250 °C [23], the reaction temperature for bio-oil hydrogenation was 300 °C and maintained for 120 min. The other conditions were as follows: 25 g of the bio-oil mixture, 0.5 g of the catalyst (Rh/ZrO2, Pd/Al2O3 or Rh/Al2O3), 7 MPa H2, and a stirring rate of 600 rpm. None catalytic experiments were performed as a control group. After the reaction, the reactor was quickly cooled to room temperature by cooling water. Three types of reaction products (solids, gas, and liquids) were obtained. Suspended solids were filtered, and the immiscible liquid products were separated into light oil (upper layer) and heavy oil (bottom layer) to analyze their physicochemical properties. Each experiment was repeated three times."
7,Characteristic analysis and calculation methods,"2.6 Characteristic analysis and calculation methods The mixture of hydrogenation products was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (Hewlett-Packard 6890; Agilent Technologies 5975C) and quantified using the internal standard method. Changes in guaiacol conversion rate were used to evaluate the catalytic performance of the prepared Rh/ZrO2. The guaiacol conversion rate (C gua[mol%]) was obtained by subtracting the percentage of guaiacol's final moles in the reacted mixture over the initial guaiacol moles in the feed mixture, from hundred. The analytical methods used for analyzing the crude oil and upgraded products were as follows: Product yields were calculated by weighing bio-oil, catalyst, solid, and liquid products using a high-precision analytical balance. The moisture contents were tested using the Karl-Fischer titration method (ASTM E203) via a Karl Fischer Moisture Analyzer (Metrohm, model KFT 870). The density value was measured with a densitometer (DMA4100M, Anton Paar purchased). The calorific values were calculated using an XRY-1B oxygen bomb calorimeter. A LECO CHNS-932 analyzer was used for elemental analysis (mass percentage of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen) of the crude bio-oil and the upgraded liquid products. The molar ratios of O/C and H/C were further calculated based on the elemental analysis results. The yield of solids, heavy oil, light oil, and gas products was calculated using Equations (1)–(4), respectively. (1) Y solids = m solids m bio - oil × 100 % (2) Y heavy oil = m heavy oil m bio - oil × 100 % (3) Y light oil = m light oil m bio - oil × 100 % (4) Y gas = m bio - oil − m solids − m heavy - oil − m light - oil m bio - oil × 100 % where Y solids , Y heavy oil , Y light oil, and Y gas represent the yields of solid products, bottom heavy oil, light oil, and gas, respectively (wt%). m solids 、m heavy oil 、m light oil and m bio-oil stand for the mass (g) of solid products, bottom heavy oil, light oil, and crude bio-oil, respectively. The DE of each reaction process was derived according to its definition and obtained after further modification based on the previous study [41] to evaluate the degree of hydrodeoxygenation as an important indicator for measuring the catalyst effect. The DE formula used in this study was precisely calculated based on the atomic ratio of O/C of the crude bio-oil and the target product of heavy oil, as shown in Equation (5). (5) DE = ( O/C ) bio - oil − ( O/C ) heavy oil ( O/C ) bio - oil × 100 % where DE stands for deoxygenation extent (%), (O/C) bio-oil refers to the atomic ratio of oxygen to carbon of the crude bio-oil, and (O/C) heavy oil is to the atomic ratio of oxygen to carbon of the heavy oil product."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Properties of catalysts,"3.1 Properties of catalysts The morphological characteristics of the prepared Rh/ZrO2 and commercial Rh/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are shown in Fig. 2 . The physicochemical properties of the catalysts, including metal loading rate, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) binding energy, BET surface area, and pore volume, were also characterized, and the results are shown in Table 2 . The NH3-TPD and H2-TPR results of the prepared Rh/ZrO2 and commercial Rh/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts are presented in Fig. 3 and Table 3 , respectively. The tested metal loading rates of commercial Rh/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts were 5.415 wt% and 5.012 wt%, respectively, while the prepared Rh/ZrO2 catalyst had a lower metal loading rate of 0.415 wt%. For the three catalysts, different carriers led to differences in BET and pore volume. Since the prepared Rh/ZrO2 and the commercial Rh/Al2O3 had the same noble metal, the valence state of the loading-metal Rh was analyzed using their XPS binding energy results. Accordingly, the valence state of Rh in Rh/ZrO2 catalyst was a composite positive oxidation state, while that of the commercial Rh/Al2O3 catalyst was more of a zero-valent state. The SEM results shown in Fig. 2 revealed the morphological characteristics of different catalysts. The commercial catalysts formed many metal clusters on the surface, usually found on similar noble-metal catalysts reported in the literature [29,42,43]. However, in the prepared Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, no metal cluster was found on the surface. The spherical particles of different supported Rh catalysts (Rh/ZrO2 and Rh/Al2O3) showed different morphological characteristics due to their different supports. For the commercial catalysts of Rh/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3, the uniformity of metal loading on the catalyst surface was quite different. The former was more uniform, while the latter formed larger metal clusters. This difference in morphological characteristics could lead to different hydrotreating effects. The NH3-TPD results are presented in Fig. 3. The Rh/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 commercial catalysts showed a strong desorption peak at 399 °C and 409 °C indicating the presence of strong acid sites (usually 330–550 °C). Compared with the original carrier of ZrO2, which exhibited a strong and narrow desorption peak at 466 °C, the catalyst supported by Rh metal showed a wider NH3-desorption peak at a lower temperature of 354 °C. On the other hand, for Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, the peak position for strong acid sites shifted to a low temperature. Moreover, the intensity of weak acid site peaks increased at 143 °C, suggesting that some newly weak acid sites had been created. Besides, compared with the original ZrO2 support, the intensity of strong acid site peaks in Rh/ZrO2 was reduced, suggesting the loss of strong acid sites. The correlation between the catalytic activity and surface acidity has been demonstrated [44], confirming that acid sites have a vital role in a series of reactions such as cracking, dehydration, cyclization, oligomerization, dehydrogenation and aromatization, while metal sites exhibit high levels of hydrogenation and deoxygenation of oxygenated aromatic compounds [31]. These results of NH3-TPD indicated that the impregnation of noble metal would result in the change of the acidity, significantly influencing their catalytic performance for the product. The H2-TPR results of the ZrO2 support, the prepared Rh/ZrO2, the Rh/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 commercial catalysts are presented in Table 3. The H2-TPR of the Rh/Al2O3 catalyst showed two main reduction steps at 158 °C and 491 °C, correspondingly lower than that of the ZrO2 support (241 °C and 568 °C). Rh metal prompted the reduction step to take place at a lower temperature than the original carrier of ZrO2 and reduced the H2 consumption. One main reduction step causing 1.566 mmol/g H2 consumption at 430 °C was detected for the supported Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The Rh/ZrO2, Rh/Al2O3, and Pd/Al2O3 commercial catalysts presented a reduction step at 420–490 °C, which corresponded to the reaction of H2 with oxygen atoms present in the support."
10,Effect of Rh/ZrO2 catalyst on hydrogenation of bio-oil model compound,"3.2 Effect of Rh/ZrO2 catalyst on hydrogenation of bio-oil model compound To verify the hydrogenation effect of the prepared Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, the bio-oil model compound guaiacol was used as raw material. These effects were evaluated by the conversion rate of the reactants. The conversion rate of guaiacol at 350 °C in the presence of the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst is shown in Fig. 4 . As presented in Fig. 4, the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst activity was excellent since the guaiacol conversion rate reached 99.51 mol% through the reaction for 25 min at 350 °C. The final conversion rate of guaiacol was close to 100 mol%. For the control group (without catalyst), guaiacol's conversion rate reached only 6.58 mol% after 240 min. The balanced metal loading and dispersion of Rh/ZrO2 could explain the high activity. The qualitative analysis of the composition of the liquid products by GC-MS showed that the final products obtained in the Rh/ZrO2 catalytic group were mainly non-oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane. The products in the non-catalyzed group were trace amounts of cyclohexanone and some complex oxygenated compounds. Compared with the pure liquid phase product of the catalytic group, guaiacol in the non-catalytic group was mainly converted into some unknown insoluble substances. The distribution of the intermediates produced in the inchoate period of the hydrodeoxygenation process and the composition of the final products inferred that guaiacol was first converted into cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol rapidly (in 15 min) and then finally deoxygenated into the dominant cyclohexane and some 6-carbon hydrocarbon isomers. Notably, it has been reported that cyclohexanone can be obtained directly by dehydrogenation from cyclohexanol as a short-lived reversible intermediate [26], and was also proposed to be produced by directly hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol [31]. It is postulated that for the HDO of guaiacol over Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, the main pathway was guaiacol →(cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol) → cyclohexane. Therefore, it could be deduced that the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst possessed an excellent hydrodeoxygenation activity, which involved the hydrogenation of the benzene ring and the deoxygenation of the oxygen-containing functional groups. It can be inferred that 0.5 wt% Rh/ZrO2 catalyst would be efficient for the hydrotreatment of crude bio-oils containing high oxygenated aromatic compounds like guaiacol."
11,Regeneration and stability characteristics of Rh/ZrO2,"3.3 Regeneration and stability characteristics of Rh/ZrO2 The regeneration characteristic of the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst was performed by its repeated utilization for five experimental rounds and measured by the conversion rate of guaiacol. Fig. 5 shows the results of repeatability and regeneration experiments of the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst. Stability characteristics for Rh/ZrO2 catalyst were evaluated by the BET area results, pore volume of the spent Rh/ZrO2 catalyst used in hydrodeoxidation experiments of guiacol, and carbon deposition as an additional characterization for spent catalyst. Results of the physicochemical property and carbon deposition for spent Rh/ZrO2 catalyst are shown in Table 4 . As shown in Fig. 5, the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst reused for the second time showed a similar result with the first-time use, obtaining a 99.1 mol% conversion rate. The conversion rate of guaiacol decreased along with the increase in catalyst re-utilization. In the fifth repetition, the conversion rate of the reactant was reduced to as low as 50.3 mol%. However, the conversion rate of guaiacol with the regenerated catalyst was restored to 92.4 mol%. Compared with the fresh Rh/ZrO2 catalyst (63.6 m2/g BET, and 0.185 cm3/g pore volume, as shown in Table 2), the BET areas of the first-used, the 5th-used and the regeneration Rh/ZrO2 catalysts all slightly increased (as presented in Table 4), but the pore volume showed an opposite trend. There was no appreciable difference in the surface SEM images of the fresh and the spent catalysts. With the increase of reuse frequency, the specific surface area of the catalyst increased slightly, which might be caused by the carbon deposition on the surface of the used Rh/ZrO2 catalyst. It should be noted that these nanoscale carbon deposits have a larger specific surface area than the zirconia particles. At the same time, the pore volume decreased with the increase of reusing times, which might be ascribed to the catalyst carbon deposition or some slight sintering caused by the long-time reaction at high temperatures. The results of the carbon deposition analysis (as shown in Table 4) further confirmed the occurrence of the carbon deposition assumption. The carbon deposition on the five time-used Rh/ZrO2 catalyst (10.5 wt%) was quite higher than the one time-used one (3.7 wt%). The accumulation of carbon deposits could be ascribed to undesired polymerization or cracking reactions caused by low H2 coverage or low catalytic activity of the catalysts at high temperatures [29]. After regeneration treatment, the carbon deposition on the spent Rh/ZrO2 catalyst was reduced by 63%. These experimental results indicated that Rh/ZrO2 could be deactivated to a certain extent when used repeatedly. Nevertheless, the regeneration of the deactivated Rh/ZrO2 through carbon deposition removal and hydrogen reduction could restore its conversion capacity close to that of the fresh catalyst. Hence, the deactivation could be mainly caused by coke formation covering the active center on the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst's surface since deactivation caused by structural changes and metal pollution would be challenging to restore."
12,Product yield of bio-oil hydrotreatment by Rh/ZrO2 and commercial catalysts,"3.4 Product yield of bio-oil hydrotreatment by Rh/ZrO2 and commercial catalysts Three types of reaction products, including solids, gas, and liquid (light oil and heavy oil), were produced. The product yield results for each bio-oil hydrotreatment experiment in the presence of the Rh/ZrO2 and the commercial Rh/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . Hydrotreatment of bio-oil under Rh/ZrO2 and commercial catalysts showed significant variations in product yield. Fig. 6 reveals that the total yield of liquid products (light oil and heavy oil) under the action of Rh/ZrO2 catalyst was the highest, accounting for 78.6 wt% (containing 44.6 wt% light oil and 34.0 wt% heavy oil). The solids and gas products of the Rh/ZrO2 catalytic experiment group were 4.1 wt% and 17.3 wt%, respectively. The total yield of liquid products under the commercial Rh/Al2O3 was 68.6 wt%, which was 12.7% less than that of the Rh/ZrO2 catalyzed experimental group. The gas yield obtained in the commercial Pd/Al2O3 catalytic group was 29.8 wt%, which was the highest. Gas collected in each group contained a large amount of H2 and a small amount of CO, CH4, CO2, and C2∼C4 hydrocarbons generated during catalytic hydrotreatment. Due to the complexity of hydrogen-supplying polymerization and cracking dehydrogenation that took place between different components of bio-oil, most of the hydrogen collected was from external supply to the system. The Rh/ZrO2 catalyst performed better in terms of product yield in comparison with the commercial catalysts. Nevertheless, the main focus should be placed on product characteristics and oxygen content to evaluate the hydrogenation performance of the catalysts more effectively."
13,Products characteristics of bio-oil hydrotreatment by Rh/ZrO2 and commercial catalysts,"3.5 Products characteristics of bio-oil hydrotreatment by Rh/ZrO2 and commercial catalysts In assessing the hydrogenation performance of the different catalysts used, the product characteristics and changes in oxygen content between bio-oil and products after hydrotreating were considered. The characteristics of crude bio-oil and products after hydrotreating under Rh/ZrO2 and commercial catalysts are tabulated in Table 5 . Compared with crude bio-oil (moisture content 32.57 wt%), the moisture content of the heavy oil products catalyzed by Rh/ZrO2, Rh/Al2O3, and Pd/Al2O3 was significantly reduced to 0.95 wt%, 1.20 wt%, and 1.13 wt%, respectively. However, the moisture content of light oil products (66.31–69.31 wt%) was higher with a lower density than bio-oil. The high calorific values of different heavy oil products catalyzed by Rh/ZrO2, Rh/Al2O3, and Pd/Al2O3 increased by 81.1%, 80.5%, and 75.3% in comparison with bio-oil (17.23 MJ/kg), respectively. For the heavy oil produced in experimental groups under Rh/ZrO2, Pd/Al2O3, and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, the oxygen content was 28.20 wt%, 29.10 wt%, and 30.20 wt% lower than the crude bio-oil (48.01 wt%), respectively. Generally, the oxygen content of heavy oil products was reduced significantly, mainly due to the oxygen removal by hydrodeoxygenation reactions catalyzed by Rh/ZrO2, Pd/Al2O3, and Pd/Al2O3. Regarding the non-catalyzed experimental group, the high heating value of the products was slightly higher (20.89 MJ/kg) than the crude bio-oil (17.23 MJ/kg). The control experiment was marginally lower in terms of the oxygen content, mainly due to water separation caused by the stratification of liquid products after secondary heating."
14,Effect of different catalysts on elemental composition and deoxygenation extent,"3.6 Effect of different catalysts on elemental composition and deoxygenation extent Because of the high moisture content of the light oil, heavy oil is usually used as the target product after hydro-refining. Hence, this research emphasizes the analysis of heavy oil. Firstly, the O/C and H/C molar ratios were used as the evaluation indicators to assess the catalytic effects on the bio-oil hydrotreatment. Then, the DE (%) for each catalytic group was calculated based on Equation (5) to evaluate the hydrodeoxygenation effect of different catalysts. The O/C and H/C molar ratios of the heavy oil produced in bio-oil hydrotreatment experiments were compared with those of the crude bio-oil, gasoline and diesel, and bituminous coal reported in the literature. The results are shown as a Van Krevelen diagram in Fig. 7 a, and the DE (%) results are shown in Fig. 7b. As presented in Fig. 7a, the O/C molar ratios of all catalytic groups showed an apparent reduction compared with the O/C molar ratio of the crude bio-oil (0.798 mol/mol) used in this work, bituminous coal (H/C ≈ 0.879 mol/mol, O/C ≈ 0.139 mol/mol), and gasoline-and-diesel (H/C = 1.80–2.1 mol/mol, O/C = 0–0.002 mol/mol) [29]. The O/C molar ratio of the heavy oil product catalyzed by Rh/ZrO2 at 300 °C for 120 min was 0.332 mol/mol. Also, the O/C- ratios of the product catalyzed by the commercial Rh/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalyst were 0.345 mol/mol and 0.365 mol/mol, respectively. The O/C ratio of the control test was a little lower than that of the crude bio-oil but higher than those of the catalyzed groups, indicating that the deoxygenation reaction was poor in the non-catalyzed group. The quality of the heavy oil products after catalytic hydrotreatment was improved but still not as good as “diesel”, and the O/C ratios are worse than that of bituminous coal, but with a better H/C molar ratio. The synthesized Rh/ZrO2 and the commercial Rh/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalyst showed moderate deoxygenation and low hydrogenation activity. From Fig. 7b, the DE of bio-oil hydrotreatment under Rh/ZrO2 catalysis at 300 °C was 58.49%, which was higher than that of the non-catalyzed group (23.12%) and slightly higher than those of the commercial Rh/Al2O3 (56.82%) and Pd/Al2O3 (54.25%) groups. These results could indicate the potential for bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation using the Rh-based noble-metal catalysts. It can be concluded that the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst exhibited a slight advantage over the commercial catalysts under the conditions of this work. However, the actual catalytic effect of the hydrotreating process would be affected by a variety of complicated factors, such as a suitable bio-oil to catalyst ratio or solvent type, etc., because of the complex composition of bio-oil. Therefore, more influential factors need to be further studied using the Rh/ZrO2 synthesized herein and the commercial catalysts. Moreover, further works would be required to optimize the potential deoxidation efficiency and target product yield [45] as well as the environmental aspects of the process [46]. However, with regards to cost, a low metal loading rate generally indicate economic and practical superiority. Hence, the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst prepared in this work offers apparent advantages over the commercial (5 wt% metal loading) catalysts since its metal loading (0.5 wt%) was 10 times lower while still exhibiting a similar catalytic effect."
15,Conclusions,"The outcome of this study provides an effective upgrading solution for biomass-derived bio-oil for high-hydrocarbon biofuel production by promoting hydrodeoxygenation reactions. The reproducible Rh/ZrO2 (0.5 wt%) catalyst showed a highly efficient performance and was capable of hydrogenating guaiacol completely, resulting in non-oxygenated hydrocarbons. Besides, it demonstrated more favorable bio-oil product characteristics and yield, and DE than the commercial Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts. Finally, the 10 times lower metal loading of the developed catalyst indicated its economic superiority and potential commercial applications. This work is expected to provide insights to select appropriate catalysts and hydrogenation conditions, leading to more efficient bio-oil upgrading. Admittedly, because of the complex composition of bio-oil, its catalytic upgrading process and the final hydrotreatment effect would be affected by a variety of complicated factors in addition to catalyst efficiency. Therefore, further research on more influential factors needs to be done using the synthesized Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, such as screening a more suitable bio-oil to catalyst ratio or solvent type, etc. As mentioned earlier, future investigations should also aim to optimize the potential deoxidation efficiency and target product yield."
