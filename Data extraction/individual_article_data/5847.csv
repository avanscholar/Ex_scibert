0,Introduction,"With the long-term and large-quantity non-renewable energy consumption, hydrogen with high energy density is regarded as excellent clean fuel for alleviating the energy shortage and improving the environmental problems, whose combustion products are just water. Recently, ZnO for H2 production has been extensively attracted attentions [1]. When the light is irradiated on ZnO under the water, photogenerated electrons are captured by H+, reducing to H2. And under ultrasonic treatment, ZnO is forced to form a build-in electric field and the recombination rate of electrons and holes can be further decreased to product more H2. However, a broad absorption in the ultra violet region are shown in the absorption spectrum of ZnO, which limits the development and application in visible light. Modifying with narrow-band gap semiconductors can significantly enhance visible light adsorption rate [2]. CuS is an excellent candidate for forming heterostructure with ZnO due to the low band gap (1.72 eV) [3]. However, CuS nanoparticles are synthesized with high pressure and high temperature, which restricts their further applications in commercial development [4,5]. It can be assumed that a new nanostructure for excellent piezo-photocatalytic performance of H2 production can be obtained by constructing CuS/ZnO heterostructure. In this paper, we report a nanostructure from CuS/ZnO nanowires (NWs) on steel mesh for piezo-photocatalytic H2 production. In addition, a two-step hydrothermal route under mild conditions is utilized to construct CuS/ZnO heterostructure. Under solar and ultrasonic exposure, the CuS/ZnO NWs exhibit great piezo-photocatalytic performance (140 μmol g−1 h−1). This performance can be attributed to piezo-photocatalytic effect, decreasing the recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. This H2 production mechanism holds great promise for development novel clean fuel."
1,Experiments,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) was purchased from Macklin Inc.. Sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Techology Co., Ltd. Methanol (CH3OH), ammonia solution (25–28% NH3·H2O) and copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) were provided from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. The steel mesh was purchased from Taobao. All chemicals were analytic pure and utilized without further purification."
3,Synthesis of CuS/ZnO NWs,"2.2 Synthesis of CuS/ZnO NWs The CuS/ZnO NWs on the steel mesh were synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal route. At first, a pre-cut appropriate size steel wire mesh (4 cm × 8 cm) was washed by deionized water and alcohol several times to remove the impurities and dried in N2 flow. Then, the cleaned steel mesh was immersed in the solution (containing 35 mmol/L Zn(NO3)2, 70 mmol/L NH3·H2O in 250 mL deionized water) kept at 83 °C. After 24 h, the substrate with ZnO NWs was cleaned by deionized water and alcohol several times and dried in air at 60 °C. Secondly, substrate with ZnO NWs was ordinal submerged in 10 mmol/L Na2S aqueous solution for 30 s and in 10 mmol/L CuSO4 aqueous solution for 30 s. The process was repeated for 30 times to obtain a uniform CuS layer coated on the ZnO NWs. Finally, the CuS/ZnO NWs on steel mesh were cleaned by deionized water and alcohol several times and dried in air at 60 °C."
4,Characterization and measurement,"2.3 Characterization and measurement The microstructures of the materials were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010). The crystal phases of materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Dmax 2550 V, Cu Kα radiation). The elementary composition was analyzed by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS, Hitachi S4800). UV–vis absorption spectrum was measured at room temperature in the 200–800 nm wavelength range using a UV–vis-NIR spectrometer (Hitachi U-3900) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements was performed with a He–Cd cw laser at room temperature. The piezo-photocatalytic performance of CuS/ZnO NWs was recurred to measure the quality of H2 production. The simulating environment was provided by a photocatalytic reaction system (Perfectlight Labsolar-IIIAG). The mesh was put in the glass reaction vessel (containing 20 vol% of methanol) of the photocatalytic reaction system. The light source and ultrasonic irradiation were provided by a xenon lamp (Perfectlight PLS-SXE300CUV, 50 W, 200–2500 nm) and an ultrasonic cleaner (KH-50A, 50 W), respectively. A gas chromatograph (Techcomp GC7900) was used to evaluate the quality of H2 production with N2 as carrier gas."
5,Results and discussion,"The morphology of ZnO NWs and CuS/ZnO NWs is shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1a and b show SEM images of ZnO NWs and CuS/ZnO NWs, respectively. More details can be seen in Fig. S1. Both the length of the ZnO NWs and CuS/ZnO NWs are ~5 μm and the diameter of ZnO NWs is similar to the diameter of CuS/ZnO NWs (~100 nm). The elemental mapping of one single CuS/ZnO nanowire is shown in Fig. 1c. The insets indicate that Zn, Cu, O and S elements are in the composites. Fig. S2 shows EDS spectrum of CuS/ZnO NWs on steel mesh and ZnO NWs on steel mesh, respectively. The peaks of Zn, O, Cu and S are contributed to CuS/ZnO NWs and the peaks of Fe are contributed to steel mesh, which is the substructure of ZnO NWs. Fig. 1d shows the TEM image of CuS/ZnO. These results indicate CuS nanoparticles are uniformly coated on the surface of the ZnO NWs and do not affect the lattice structure of ZnO NWs. Fig. 1e shows the XRD pattern of CuS/ZnO NWs (blue line) on steel mesh and ZnO NWs (yellow line) on steel mesh, respectively. The diffraction peaks of ZnO NWs on steel mesh (black square) can be indexed to ZnO crystal (JCPDS NO. 36-1451, black line). And the diffraction peaks of CuS/ZnO NWs on steel mesh (red circle) can be indexed to CuS crystal (JCPDS NO. 06-0464, red line) Furthermore, the diffraction peaks (green pound sign) near 44.2°, 51.3° and 75.2° is contributed to steel mesh (substructure). Fig. 1f shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of ZnO NWs and CuS/ZnO NWs, respectively. It can be clearly observed that both ZnO and CuS/ZnO exhibit a strong absorption band (λ < 400 nm) and CuS/ZnO exhibits an additional absorption band (λ > 600 nm). This result indicates that CuS/ZnO nanostructure has great photocatalytic efficiency under solar exposure. Fig. 1g shows the room temperature PL spectra of CuS/ZnO, indicating the band gap of CuS (2.36 eV) and ZnO (3.2 eV), respectively [6]. These results suggest the CuS/ZnO NWs exhibit a broad absorption in the light range and the CuS/ZnO nanostructure have great applications in piezo-photocatalytic H2 production. Fig. 2 a shows experimental design for H2 production and the details can be seen in experimental section. Fig. 2b shows H2 production of CuS/ZnO under different conditions. And the H2 production of CuS/ZnO with illumination and ultrasonic for 2 h can obtain 280 μmol g−1 (without illumination and ultrasonic: 0 μmol g−1, with ultrasonic for 2 h: 32 μmol g−1, with illumination for 2 h: 102 μmol g−1). And in three cycles, the H2 production is 280, 267 and 275 μmol g−1, respectively, showing the good stability and recyclability (Fig. 2c). The H2 evolution rate can remain ~ 92% of the initial evolution rate (Fig. 2c) after 7 days and the CuS/ZnO NWs exhibit good performance comparing to other similar materials (Table S1). Fig. 3 a shows the piezo-photocatalytic mechanism of CuS/ZnO nanostructure for H2 production under solar and ultrasonic exposure. CuS/ZnO NWs are forced to bend due to the ultrasonic treatment, forming a build-in electric field from stretching side to compressing side [7]. And the photo-generated electrons and holes are further separated along opposite directions due to the built-in electric field, decreasing the recombination rate and increasing the photocatalytic efficiency [8,9]. Finally, the H+ ions are reduced to H2 and the methanol is transformed to CO2 [10,11]. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 2b (blue line and red line), the H2 evolution rate under ultrasound treatment is higher than the H2 evolution rate without ultrasound, which is contributed to the built-in electric field. Fig. 3b shows the band diagram of CuS/ZnO nanostructure. The heterojunction can be formed with a depletion layer created around the boundary region between the interface of CuS and ZnO. Under solar exposure, electrons are excited from valence band to conduction band, leaving an equal number of holes in the valence band. And under ultrasonic treatment, the piezoelectric field from the bending CuS/ZnO NWs can further separate the photogenerated electron-hole pairs and decrease the recombination rate. Thus, the photocatalytic performance can be further improved [6,10]. The overall process of H2 generation can be described by the chemical reaction as shown in Fig. 3c [12]. It is worth noting that methanol is used for sacrificial reagent. During the piezo-photocatalytic process, the H+ is reduced to hydrogen on the surface of CuS/ZnO NWs."
6,Conclusion,"In summary, CuS/ZnO NWs on steel mesh for piezo-photocatalytic H2 production are synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal route. Under solar and ultrasonic exposure, the CuS/ZnO NWs demonstrate great piezo-photocatalytic performance. Basing on the piezo-photocatalytic effect, the H2 production of CuS/ZnO NWs is up to 280 μmol g−1 with illumination and ultrasonic for 2 h. This H2 production mechanism has potential applications in development of novel clean fuel."
