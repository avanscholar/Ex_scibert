0,Introduction,"The selective hydrogenation of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene to aniline are important in the production of herbicides, dyes, pigments and fine chemicals [1,2]. Conventional batch synthesis delivers low product yields, is energy inefficient and generates significant waste where exclusive reduction of the carbonyl and nitro group is challenging [3]. Continuous gas phase reaction presents a number of advantages including ease of product/catalyst separation and reduced downtime [4]. Supported Au at the nano-scale (<10nm) exhibits unique selectivity in the hydrogenation of multi-functional reactants although activity is lower compared with conventional transition metals (Pt, Ru, Pd and Ni) [5] due to the limited capacity of Au to chemisorb/dissociate H2 [6]. Studies to date on the catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl (acrolein, benzalacetone, cinnamaldehyde and crotonaldehyde) [7,8] and nitro (chloronitrobenzene, nitrostyrene and nitrobenzaldehyde) [9,10] compounds have shown a dependence on the electronic and geometric properties of the Au phase that are influenced by the support. Smaller Au particles are formed on reducible oxides (e.g. TiO2 and CeO2) relative to non-reducible ZrO2 and SiO2 [11,12]. Higher turnover frequencies (TOF) with decreasing Au size (2–9nm) has been reported in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde [11,13] and nitrobenzene [14] for Au supported on TiO2, Al2O3 and SiO2. Okumura et al. [11] observed higher alcohol selectivity (from crotonaldehyde) over Au/TiO2 than Au/Al2O3 and Au/SiO2. Milone and co-workers [15] proposed that reducible iron oxides promote the formation of electron-rich Au through metal-support electron transfer that favours CHO reduction. Rojas et al. [16] concluded that negatively charged Au (on SiO2) binds the electrophilic carbon in CHO facilitating hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde and benzalacetone. In nitro group reduction, the high selectivity exhibited by Au/TiO2 has been attributed to metal-support synergy that promotes NO2 activation [17]. Shimizu et al. [18] considered the role of Al2O3 acidity/basicity in tandem with coordinatively unsaturated Au to dissociate H2 to H+/H− at the metal/support interface and selectively reduce NO2 in the presence of other reactive functionalities. In the hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene unwanted hydrodechlorination was reported for Au/Ce0.62Zr0.38O2 and ascribed to CCl scission at oxygen vacancy sites [19]. Selective hydrogenation has been well established for Au catalysts but the contribution of the support in modifying Au structure, reactant activation and overall surface reaction mechanism is far from resolved. In this study we compare the catalytic action of Au nanoparticles on oxides (γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, CeO2, α-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) with distinct redox character in the hydrogenation of CHO (benzaldehyde) and NO2 (nitrobenzene) and correlate performance with catalyst structure. We propose surface reaction mechanisms to account for the role of support reducibility in governing CHO and NO2 activation and product selectivity."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation and activation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and activation The supports employed in this study were obtained from commercial sources (γ-Al2O3 (Puralox, Condea Vista), TiO2 (P25, Degussa) and CeO2 (Grace Davison)) or synthesised (α-Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and ZrO2) as described elsewhere [12,20]. Supported Au catalysts were prepared by deposition-precipitation using urea (Riedel-de Haën, 99%) as basification agent. An aqueous solution of urea (100-fold excess) and HAuCl4 (3–7×10−3 M, 400cm3, Sigma Aldrich, 99%) was added to the support (10–30g). The suspension was stirred and heated (2Kmin−1) to 353K where the pH progressively increased (to 6.5–8.0) as a result of urea decomposition: (1) N H 2 C O N H 2 + 3 H 2 O → T = 353 K 2 N H 4 + + 2 O H − + C O 2 The solid obtained was separated by filtration, washed with distilled water until Cl free (from AgNO3 test) and dried (2Kmin−1) in 45cm3 min−1 He at 373K for 5h. The catalyst precursors were sieved (ATM fine test sieves) to mean particle diameter=75μm and activated at 2Kmin−1 to 423–673K in 60cm3 min−1 H2. The catalysts were cooled to ambient temperature and passivated in 1% v/v O2/He for off-line characterisation."
3,Catalyst characterisation,"2.2 Catalyst characterisation Gold content was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Shimadzu AA-6650 spectrometer with an air-acetylene flame) from the diluted extract in aqua regia (25% v/v HNO3/HCl). The pH associated with the point of zero charge (pHpzc) of the support was determined using the potentiometric mass titration technique described in detail elsewhere [21]. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR), H2 chemisorption/temperature programmed desorption (TPD), O2 chemisorption and specific surface area (SSA) measurements were conducted on the CHEM-BET 3000 (Quantachrome) unit equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for continuous monitoring of gas composition and the TPR Win™ software for data acquisition/manipulation. Samples were loaded into a U-shaped Pyrex quartz cell (3.76mm i.d.) and heated in 17cm3 min−1 (Brooks mass flow controlled) 5% v/v H2/N2 at 2Kmin−1 to 423–673K for supported Au catalysts and to 1073–1273K for the supports where the effluent gas passed through a liquid N2 trap. The activated samples were swept with 65cm3 min−1 N2 for 1.5h, cooled to reaction temperature (413K) and subjected to a H2 (BOC, >99.98%) pulse (10μl) titration procedure. Samples were cooled to ambient temperature, thoroughly flushed in N2 (65cm3 min‐1) to remove weakly bound H2 and subjected to TPD (at 50Kmin−1) to 873–1173K with a final isothermal hold until the signal returned to baseline. Oxygen (BOC, 99.9%) pulse (50μl) titration at 413K post-TPR was employed to determine the extent of support reduction where any contribution from Au to total O2 adsorption is negligible [22]. SSA (reproducible to ±8%) was recorded in 30% v/v N2/He with undiluted N2 (BOC, 99.9%) as internal standard. At least three cycles of N2 adsorption-desorption were employed using the standard single point BET method. Pore volume was measured using the Micromeritics Gemini VII 2390p system. Prior to analysis, samples were outgassed at 423K for 1h in N2. Total pore volume was obtained at a relative N2 pressure (P/P 0)=0.95. X-ray diffractograms (XRD) were recorded on a Bruker/Siemens D500 incident X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Samples were scanned at 0.02° step−1 over the range 20°≤2θ≤80° and the diffractograms identified against the JCPDS-ICDD reference standards, i.e. Au (04-0784), γ-Al2O3 (10-0425), anatase-TiO2 (A-TiO2, 21–1272), rutile-TiO2 (R-TiO2, 21–1276), monoclinic-ZrO2 (M-ZrO2, 37–1784), tetragonal-ZrO2 (T-ZrO2, 50–1089), CeO2 (43–1002), α-Fe2O3 (hematite, 33-0664) and Fe3O4 (magnetite, 19-0629). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis was performed on a VG ESCA spectrometer equipped with monochromatised Al Kα radiation (1486eV). The sample was adhered to conducting carbon tape, mounted in the sample holder and subjected to ultra-high vacuum conditions (<10−8 Torr). Full range surveys (Au 4f 5/2 and 4f 7/2 spectra) were collected where the binding energies (BE) were calibrated with respect to the C 1s peak (284.5eV). The Au 4f spectra were fitted with abstraction of the Shirley background using the Gaussian-Lorentzian function in XPSPEAK 41. Gold particle morphology (size and shape) was examined by transmission (TEM, JEOL JEM 2011) and scanning transmission (STEM, JEOL 2200FS field emission gun-equipped unit) electron microscopy, employing Gatan Digital Micrograph 1.82 for data acquisition/manipulation. Samples for analysis were dispersed in acetone and deposited on a holey carbon/Cu grid (300 Mesh). The surface area weighted mean Au size (d) was based on a count of at least 300 particles according to (2) d ⁡ = ∑ i n i d i 3 ∑ i n i d i 2 where ni is the number of particles of diameter di ."
4,Catalytic procedure,"2.3 Catalytic procedure Catalyst testing was carried out at atmospheric pressure, in situ after activation, in a continuous flow fixed bed tubular reactor (i.d.=15mm) at 413–573K under conditions of negligible heat/mass transport limitations. A layer of borosilicate glass beads served as preheating zone, ensuring the organic reactant was vaporised and reached reaction temperature before contacting the catalyst (10–40mg). Isothermal conditions (±1K) were maintained by diluting the catalyst bed with ground glass (75μm). Reaction temperature was continuously monitored by a thermocouple inserted in a thermowell within the catalyst bed. Reactants (benzaldehyde (Fluka, ≥98%), nitrobenzene (Riedel-de Haën, ≥99%) or benzyl alcohol (Riedel-de Haën, ≥99%)) were delivered as an ethanolic (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99%) solution to the reactor via a glass/teflon air-tight syringe and teflon line using a microprocessor controlled infusion pump (Model 100 kd Scientific) at a fixed calibrated flow rate. Reactions were conducted in a co-current flow of reactant with H2 (BOC, >99.98%, 60cm3 min−1) at GHSV =2×104 h−1. The molar Au to inlet organic molar feed rate (n/F) spanned the range 1.2×10−3–3.7×10−3 h. In blank tests, passage of each reactant in a stream of H2 through the empty reactor or over the support did not result in any detectable conversion. The reactor effluent was collected in a liquid nitrogen trap for subsequent analysis using a Perkin-Elmer Auto System XL gas chromatograph equipped with a programmed split/splitless injector and a flame ionisation detector (FID), employing a DB-1 (50m×0.33mm i.d., 0.20μm film thickness) capillary column (J&W Scientific). Data acquisition and manipulation were performed using the TurboChrom Workstation Version 6.3.2 (for Windows) chromatography data system. Reactant conversion (X) is defined by (3) X ( % ) = [ r e a c t a n t ] i n − [ r e a c t a n t ] o u t [ r e a c t a n t ] i n × 100 and selectivity (S) to product (j) is given by (4) S j ( % ) = [ p r o d u c t ] j , o u t [ r e a c t a n t ] i n − [ r e a c t a n t ] o u t × 100 where subscripts “in” and “out” refer to inlet and outlet gas streams. Catalytic activity is also quantified in terms of initial conversion obtained from time on-stream measurements and turnover frequency (TOF, rate per active site) calculated using Au dispersion (D) obtained from STEM analysis [23] according to: (5) T O F ( h − 1 ) = R D where R represents reactant consumption rate (molreactant molmetal −1 h−1). Repeated reactions with different samples from the same batch of catalyst delivered raw data reproducibility and mass balances within ±5%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterisation,"3.1 Catalyst characterisation 3.1.1 Structural characteristics and temperature programmed reduction (TPR) Catalyst physico-chemical characteristics are presented in Table 1 . SSA range from 11m2 g−1 (Au/Fe3O4) to 166m2 g−1 (Au/γ-Al2O3) with a corresponding increase in pore volume (0.02-0.36cm3 g−1). Values obtained for each catalyst are in good agreement with those reported in the literature [24–27]. The TPR profiles of the supported Au catalyst precursors and corresponding supports are presented in Fig. 1 . TPR of Au/γ-Al2O3 (AI) and Au/ZrO2 (CI) generated positive signals with associated temperature maxima (T max) at 451 and 476K, respectively where H2 consumption matched the requirement for Au3+ reduction to Au0 (Table 1). The profiles generated for the γ-Al2O3 (AII) and ZrO2 (CII) supports were featureless with no evidence of H2 uptake or release, as noted elsewhere [25]. Activation of Au/TiO2 (BI) and Au/CeO2 (DI) presented H2 consumption peaks at lower temperatures (T max =364 and 420K) suggesting weaker metal-support interactions. This is consistent with the work of Delannoy et al. [28] who examined the effect of support redox character on Au reducibility and reported more facile reduction on TiO2 and CeO2 relative to Al2O3. Hydrogen consumed during TPR of Au/TiO2 exceeded that required for Au3+ →Au0 (Table 1) and can be attributed to a combined Au reduction with Ti4+ conversion to Ti3+ at the metal/support interface [29]. The bare TiO2 support did not exhibit a detectable TPR response (BII). In contrast, thermal treatment of CeO2 generated two broad signals at 742K and 1148K (DII) that can be ascribed to surface (523–848K [30]) and bulk (>1073K [30]) reduction. Hydrogen consumed during the activation of Au/CeO2 exceeded Au precursor reduction (Table 1) but was significantly lower than the amount needed for full reduction of the CeO2 carrier (3300μmolg−1). This suggests partial support reduction where the incorporation of Au on CeO2 lowered the requisite temperature [31]. TPR of Au/α-Fe2O3 (EI) resulted in excess H2 consumption at T max =389K whereas TPR of α-Fe2O3 (EII) generated a signal at 709K with a broader consumption at T >800K suggesting a two-stage reduction of hematite, i.e. α-Fe2O3 →Fe3O4 →FeO. The TPR response for Au/Fe3O4 (FI) also reveals a down shift in T max relative to the support (FII). The excess H2 consumed (Table 1) fell below that for conversion of Fe3O4 to FeO (4250μmolg‐1) again indicative of partial support reduction. Our results demonstrate a more facile reduction of ceria and iron oxide supports due to the presence of Au. Jacobs et al. [32] have established partial CeO2 reduction by spillover hydrogen following dissociative adsorption on supported Au. Furthermore, Scirè and co-workers [33] proposed that Au can weaken the Fe-O bond in iron oxide substrates resulting in greater lattice oxygen mobility and enhanced reducibility. 3.1.2 Hydrogen temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and O2 chemisorption Application of TPD to measure surface hydrogen release can allow differentiation between chemisorbed and spillover species which both serve as reactive hydrogen in hydrogenation [34]. The TPD profiles generated for all the catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . The literature suggests a lower temperature requirement for H2 desorption from metal sites (<473K) compared with release of spillover from the support (>503K) [35]. A predominant H2 desorption at T max ≥575K was observed in this work suggesting that the main contribution is due to spillover. Hydrogen spillover is influenced by the concentration of initiating and acceptor sites, catalyst activation and metal nanoparticle size (i.e. degree of contact between participating phases and metal-support interaction(s)) [35]. As a general observation, H2 release from Au supported on non-reducible (Al2O3, ZrO2) supports (28–51mmolgAu −1) was significantly greater than that recorded for Au on reducible carriers (≤9mmolgAu −1). There is compelling evidence in the literature for hydrogen spillover onto Al2O3 [34,35] and ZrO2 [36,37] from supported metals (Pd, Ni, Cu and Ru). The greater H2 desorption from Au/γ-Al2O3 relative to Au/ZrO2 can be attributed (at least in part) to the higher SSA of Al2O3 which can accommodate more spillover. Consumption of spillover hydrogen in the partial reduction of (reducible) titania, ceria and iron oxide can account for the observed lower levels of H2 TPD [34]. We employed O2 chemisorption post-TPR as a measure of support reduction [22]. Gold on CeO2, α-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 exhibited greater O2 uptake (Table 1) than that measured for Au/TiO2, Au/γ-Al2O3 and Au/ZrO2. The difference in O2 adsorption can be correlated with support redox character [38], where the former group of oxides are characterised by higher redox potentials (E redox) (Table 1). Increasing O2 chemisorption coincided with greater excess H2 consumption during TPR due to support reduction with the formation of oxygen vacancies. Oxygen deficient sites can be generated by loss of lattice oxygen from reducible metal oxides during thermal treatment in H2 or CO [39]. Boccuzzi et al. [40,41] demonstrated by FTIR spectroscopy the formation of oxygen vacancies following reduction in H2 of Fe2O3, TiO2 and CeO2 to 523K. Moreover, formation of Ce3+ defects/surface vacancies in Au/CeO2-Fe2O3 has been linked to the action of spillover hydrogen [42]. 3.1.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron microscopy analysis Structural analysis by XRD generated the diffractograms presented in Fig. 3 . There was no clearly discernible peak for Au (at 2θ=38.1°) which may be due to masking by stronger signals due to the support or the formation of Au particles at the nano-scale and below detection limit (<5nm) [43]. The XRD pattern of Au/γ-Al2O3 is characterised by peaks at 2θ=37.6°, 39.5°, 45.9° and 67.0° due to cubic γ-Al2O3. XRD analysis of Au/TiO2 revealed a mixture of tetragonal anatase (2θ=25.3°, 37.8°, 48.1° and 62.8°) and tetragonal rutile (2θ=27.4°, 36.1°, 41.2°, 54.3°, 56.6°, 69.0° and 69.8°) phases with an anatase:rutile ratio (5:1) that matches the reported Degussa P25 composition [44]. Au/ZrO2 showed mixed monoclinic (2θ=28.2°, 31.5°, 34.2°, 34.4°, 35.3°, 40.8°, 49.3°, 50.2°, 50.6° and 55.6°) and tetragonal (2θ=30.3°, 35.3°, 50.4°, 50.7°, 59.6° and 60.2°) phases with monoclinic/tetragonal ∼2. Zirconia phase composition is sensitive to synthesis route and calcination temperature with ratios in the range 1.2-3.2 reported for comparable ZrO2 preparation and pre-treatment [25]. The XRD patterns of Au on CeO2, α-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 (Fig. 3(D–F)) match those of the supports and we can discount bulk support reduction, i.e. CeO2 →Ce2O3, Fe2O3 →Fe3O4 and/or Fe3O4 →FeO. Gold particle morphology was evaluated by TEM/STEM and the representative images in Fig. 4 reveal quasi-spherical particles at the nano-scale. Surface area weighted mean Au size was obtained from the size distribution histograms and are recorded in Table 1. Gold on γ-Al2O3 (A) exhibited metal particles in the 1–8nm range with a mean of 4.3nm. Appreciably larger Au particles (2–12nm, mean=7.0nm) are observed on ZrO2 (C), consistent with the report of Mohr et al. [45] for Au/ZrO2 preparation by deposition-precipitation. Reducible CeO2 (D) and α-Fe2O3 (E) supports show narrower Au size distribution (1–5nm) and smaller mean values (2.0-2.6nm) than Au/TiO2 ((B), 1–9nm, mean=4.5nm). Support oxygen vacancies stabilise transition metal nanoparticles and inhibit sintering [46], which may result in the formation of smaller Au particles on α-Fe2O3 and CeO2 that bear a greater number of vacancies than Au/TiO2 (Table 1). It should be noted that a wider Au size range and mean (=7.6nm) characterised Au/Fe3O4. Support charge density, reflected in the pH point of zero charge (pHpzc), determines precursor-support interaction in synthesis by deposition-precipitation and can govern ultimate Au size post-TPR. Where solution pH < pHpzc, the support bears a positive charge favouring interaction with anionic Au species. Conversely, where solution pH > pHpzc the Au precursor and support experience repulsive effects due to the negative surface charge resulting in weaker Au-support interaction leading to Au agglomeration during activation [47]. Solution pH controls AuCl4 − hydrolysis rate via substitution of Cl− by OH− where Au(OH)4 − predominates at the final pH (6.5–8.0, see experimental Section 2.1) [48]. Support pHpzc are given in Table 1 where the lower value for Fe3O4 (5.8) does not favour interaction with (anionic) Au precursor species and can account for larger Au size. 3.1.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis XPS measurements were conducted to probe support effects in modifying Au electronic character. XPS profiles over the Au 4f binding energy (BE) region are given in Fig. 5 . The Au 4f 7/2 BE for Au/γ-Al2O3 (83.3eV) and Au/TiO2 (83.5eV) are close to values reported in the literature (Au/Al2O3 (83.1eV) [49] and Au/TiO2 (83.3eV) [50]) and fall below the reference metallic Au (83.7–84.0eV) [51], indicative of electron donation from the support [52]. Gold on CeO2 (Table 1) exhibits an Au 4f 7/2 BE consistent with that published for Au/CeO2 (84.5eV) [53] but lower than Au+ (85.8–86.0eV) [51]. A partial positive charge (Auδ+) has been proposed for Au/CeO2 resulting from electron transfer from Au [54]. The data presented in Fig. 6 show a dependence of Au 4f 7/2 BE on support redox potential where electron transfer from Au is facilitated by carriers with higher potential. Gold electronic structure is also dependent on Au cluster size where any shift in BE is more pronounced with decreasing coordination number [55]. The formation of smaller particles on Au/CeO2 can also contribute to an upshift of BE."
7,Catalyst activity/selectivity,"3.2 Catalyst activity/selectivity Benzyl alcohol was the sole product detected in the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde at 413K. In contrast, gas phase (383–413K) benzaldehyde conversion over (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, CeO2 and ZrO2) supported Cu and Ni resulted in CHO hydrogenolysis (to toluene) and/or CC scission (to benzene) [56,57]. The relationship between benzaldehyde turnover frequency (TOF at 413K) and Au particle size (d) is shown in Fig. 7 (I). An increase in TOF is evident with decreasing Au particle size over the 8–4nm range which can be linked to greater H2 uptake under reaction conditions (Table 1). The highest specific rate was recorded for Au/γ-Al2O3 with no detectable activity for catalysts bearing the smallest Au sizes (Au/α-Fe2O3 and Au/CeO2). It has been established that Au exhibits metal to insulator transition for particles ≤3nm [58] and decreasing hydrogenation activity for smaller Au particles (5→1nm) has been ascribed to a critical loss of metallic character [59]. Although there is insufficient published data to arrive at any reliable trends regarding Au size effects in CHO hydrogenation, we can note the reported decrease in acrolein TOF over Au/ZrO2 for Au particles >4nm [45] and increase with increasing Au size (1–5nm) over Au/ZrO2 and Au/TiO2 [59]. In contrast to the benzaldehyde reaction, each catalyst was active in nitrobenzene hydrogenation (Fig. 7(II)) with a TOF maximum for Au/γ-Al2O3. The greater reactivity of the nitro-reactant agrees with results (for Pt/Al2O3) reported by Arai et al. [60] where a six-fold higher rate was recorded for nitrobenzene relative to benzaldehyde hydrogenation. This was linked to reaction thermodynamics where nitrobenzene to aniline (ΔG413K =−436±1kJmol−1) is more favourable than benzaldehyde hydrogenation to benzyl alcohol (ΔG413K =−24±2kJmol−1). With respect to support reducibility, TOF was higher at lower redox potential as shown in Fig. 8 . Au/ZrO2 deviates somewhat from the general trend, which we tentatively attribute to the occurrence of larger Au particles (Fig. 4(C)) that show low activity in hydrogenation. Lower TOF at higher redox potential suggests that oxygen vacancies on reducible supports do not favour CHO or NO2 activation for reaction. It is known that these vacancies can strongly bind adsorbed oxygenated species [61]. Gold on non-reducible γ-Al2O3 with the formation of Auδ− (from XPS analysis) delivered the highest TOF. This agrees with published studies [16,62] which have shown that CHO activation and alcohol formation is facilitated on negatively charged Au via interaction with the electrophilic carbon. Given the negligible benzaldehyde hydrogenation activity over catalysts with smaller (<4nm) and larger (>7nm) Au particles at 413K, we evaluated the effect of reaction temperature on rate and selectivity for Au/CeO2 and Au/Fe3O4 which can be compared with Au/γ-Al2O3 in Table 2 . In each case an increase in TOF was observed at higher temperature. A switch was observed from exclusive CHO hydrogenation (to benzyl alcohol) at 413K to hydrogenolysis (to toluene) at 473K with a predominant aryl-carbonyl hydrogenolytic scission (to benzene) at 573K over Au/γ-Al2O3. A higher temperature (to 498K) has been shown to promote benzaldehyde conversion to toluene and benzene over Cu/Al2O3 [56] and Ni/SiO2 [63]. Benzaldehyde hydrogenation to benzyl alcohol was not observed over Au/Fe3O4 and Au/CeO2 at any reaction temperature (Table 2). Increased temperature generated toluene as principal product with higher selectivity to benzene at 573K (Table 2). Gold on redox supports exhibited a dominant hydrogenolytic character. Reaction of benzyl alcohol as feedstock (at 573K) over Au/Fe3O4 generated toluene as principal product and benzaldehyde (with no detectable benzene) at a similar TOF to that recorded for the benzaldehyde reaction (Table 3 ). This points to production of toluene from benzaldehyde via consecutive conversion of benzyl alcohol whereas benzene is generated from aldehyde hydrogenolysis. Benzaldehyde was the principal product in reaction over Au/CeO2, which can be attributed to oxidative dehydrogenation [64]. This step involves the catalytic action of surface or lattice oxygens associated with the support and the high aldehyde selectivity exhibited by Au/CeO2 (Table 3) must be due to greater oxygen mobility relative to Fe3O4 as inferred from O2 chemisorption (Table 1). Surface oxygen vacancies have been proposed as active sites in a range of applications from automobile exhaust treatment [65], water-gas shift [66] to steam reforming of oxygenates [67]. There is ample evidence that these vacancies can participate in a Mars and van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism with catalyst surface reduction (oxygen depletion) and re-oxidation (oxygen generation) [68]. We propose the involvement of oxygen vacancies in MvK catalytic hydrogenation, as illustrated in Fig. 9 . The vacancies, created through H2 chemisorbed on Au that spills onto the support (step A, Fig. 9 (I)) with H2O release, act as strong anchoring sites for the carbonyl group (steps B and C) [69], inhibiting reactivity. The stabilised carbonyl function can be activated at elevated temperature (473K) with benzyl alcohol formation and subsequent hydrogenolysis (step D) or direct hydrogen scission of the CHO bond (step E) to toluene. Higher temperature facilitates hydrogen cleavage to give benzene (step F). In contrast, adsorption on non-reducible surfaces (e.g. Al2O3) via the carbonyl function (step A, Fig. 10 ) results in hydrogenation to the alcohol at low reaction temperature (413K). DFT calculations have shown that a perpendicular adsorption mode is the most stable configuration with CHO bonded to the metal oxide surface via the oxygen lone electron pair that acts as a Lewis base [70]. FTIR analysis has demonstrated that surface Lewis acid sites on Al2O3 promote CHO activation in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzaldehyde [71]. Activation and scission of CH2–OH (steps B and C, Fig. 10), CHO (step D) and the aryl-carbonyl bond (steps E and F) is promoted at elevated temperature (473–573K) with the formation of toluene and benzene. In the conversion of nitrobenzene (Fig. 9 (II)) nitro group interaction with oxygen vacancies (steps A and B) has been proposed [72]. Attachment to surface vacancies can also stabilise the nitro group with lower resultant reaction rates but the greater reactivity of the NO2 function (relative to CHO) resulted in measurable activity for each catalyst at 413K. Interaction of NO2 with an oxygen vacancy and NO bond dissociation generates nitrosobenzene (step C) with subsequent reduction to a phenylhydroxylamine intermediate (step D) and aniline formation and release (step E) [68]. Dissociative interaction of H2O with oxygen vacancies serves to re-oxidise the support."
8,Conclusions,"We have demonstrated that oxide support reducibility and Au size (mean=2–8nm) governs the catalytic performance of Au in the reduction of CHO (benzaldehyde) and ‐NO2 (nitrobenzene). TPR coupled with oxygen chemisorption has established partial support (TiO2, CeO2, α-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) reduction due to the action of spillover hydrogen generated by H2 dissociation on Au. XPS analysis provided evidence of electron transfer between Au and the oxide carriers. Increasing reaction rates were observed with decreasing Au size (from 8 to 4nm) with measurably lower rates over Au <3nm. Gold on reducible supports (CeO2, α-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 where E redox >0) exhibited lower benzaldehyde and nitrobenzene TOF relative to Au/γ-Al2O3, Au/TiO2 and Au/ZrO2 (E redox <0), which we attribute to inhibition due to the action of surface oxygen vacancies. There was no measurable benzaldehyde hydrogenation activity over Au/CeO2, Au/α-Fe2O3 and Au/Fe3O4 at 413K. Reaction at higher temperatures generated toluene as principal product with secondary benzene formation and no detectable alcohol production. In contrast, reaction over Au/γ-Al2O3 resulted in exclusive benzyl alcohol formation at 413K with a progressive shift to hydrogenolysis (to toluene and benzene) at higher temperatures."
