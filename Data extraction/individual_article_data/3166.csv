0,Introduction,"Various means of biohydrogen production are under study including; biophotolysis, photo-fermentation, and dark fermentation (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002), and efforts are underway to make biohydrogen more economically feasible (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009; Mathews and Wang, 2009). Recent developments in genome sequencing, expression analysis, and gene technology have greatly increased the ability to engineer microorganisms for specific metabolic tasks. In this review we discuss the use of metabolic engineering to overcome some of the limiting factors in hydrogen production through the design and construction of efficient microorganisms with increased hydrogen yields as well as an expanded range of substrate utilization. Dark fermentation is a promising method of biohydrogen production due to its high rate of hydrogen evolution from a diverse range of substrates, and its lack of a requirement for a direct input of solar energy (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002; Hallenbeck, 2009). A variety of cheap agricultural residues, or even wastes otherwise requiring treatment are readily available feedstocks for hydrogen production by dark fermentation (Kaparaju et al., 2009; Mohan et al., 2009). Furthermore, fermentative organisms have high growth rates, and hydrogen evolution takes place under anaerobic conditions during sugar fermentation by a variety of facultative anaerobic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and strict anaerobes, e.g. Firmicutes. Fermentative bacteria have very high rates of hydrogen evolution compared with other biological hydrogen production processes and recent research has led to many improvements in bioprocess parameters leading to impressive gains in volumetric production rates. However, substrate conversion yields are low, both due to competing reactions, such as hydrogen consumption or reductant diversion to other products, and to theoretical limits of the natural metabolic pathways (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002; Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009). While theoretically, 12moles of hydrogen per mole glucose are chemically available, no known organism or existing pathway is capable of achieving this yield. The maximum yield that can be obtained with facultative anaerobes is 2moles of hydrogen per mole of glucose, whereas with strict anaerobes such as the Firmicutes it is 4moles per mole of glucose (Hallenbeck, 2005). However, in practice, yields are much lower than this, and metabolic engineering might be profitably used in attempts to increase H2 yields. Metabolic engineering uses systematic and quantitative analysis of pathways, and molecular biology and genomic approaches, to modify metabolic pathways to increase the production of natural products or to allow the production of non native products (Stephanopoulos, 1998; Wiechert, 2002). Metabolic engineering could be used to overcome limiting factors for biohydrogen production in various systems by increasing the flow of electrons to hydrogen-producing pathways, increasing substrate utilization, and engineering more efficient and/or oxygen-resistant hydrogen-evolving enzymes. In terms of dark fermentation, metabolic engineering could be used at several different levels for process improvement (Fig. 1 ) (Hallenbeck et al., 2011). For example, it could be used to extend the range of substrates used by a given organism, necessary in many cases if abundant lignocellulosic substrates are to be used as feedstock. Thus, organisms could be given the capacity to directly degrade lignocellulosics, or to use the mixture of pentoses and hexoses available after enzymatic conversion of this feedstock. Finally, metabolic engineering could be used to increase the rates and/or yields of hydrogen once the sugars are converted to pyruvate, the key intermediate. Two approaches could be taken, modification of existing pathways, or introduction of novel hydrogen producing pathways. As described below, a variety of tools for achieving these types of modifications are now available."
1,The metabolic engineering tool box,"Manipulating microbial metabolism to favor the production of desired products is almost as old as bacterial genetics. Initially, random mutagenesis; either spontaneous, chemically or ultraviolet radiation induced, or transposon mediated, was useful to knockout critical enzyme activities, if the proper selective pressure could be found. Disruption of chromosomal genes by this method has been one of the most commonly used methods for performing metabolic engineering. However, these methods, in particular chemical mutagenesis, can result in the production many nonspecific mutations. Less frequently, it was possible to select for increased activity in a given metabolic pathway due to mutations causing increased promoter activity, activation of transcription of cryptic genes, or naturally occurring genomic region duplications mediated by multiple ribosomal operons. However, despite the elaboration of many clever selection schemes, efforts in this area were severely constrained by the inability to either introduce the desired mutations at will or to carryout high throughput screening. Recently, this changed with the availability of gene or even entire genomic sequences, as well as the development of modern molecular microbiology techniques for site-directed mutagenesis. In the most common variation, this involves the delivery of the desired mutation into the chromosome through a forced homologous recombination with a mutant allele ferried by a non-replicating carrier (i.e. suicide mutagenesis). Typically, a knockout is created by flanking an antibiotic resistance marker with enough target DNA sequence (∼200bp for E. coli and many others) to allow for efficient recombination by RecA. Selection for the appropriate antibiotic resistance selects for the desired recombinant if the shuttle plasmid is incapable of replicating; for example, is either temperature sensitive for replication in E. coli, or has a narrow host range. Additional foreign genes could be brought into a host using a variety of different plasmids. Although multiple genes, or even operons, can be knocked out in this way using a series of different antibiotic resistance cassettes, and several different heterologous genes can be simultaneously expressed using different compatible plasmids, these approaches quickly run out of options. In addition, cultures must often be grown with expensive antibiotics to maintain their constructed genetic capacity, the antibiotics themselves present a waste disposal problem, and the constructed strains run afoul of anti-GMO sentiments or regulations. Very recently, new techniques have been introduced that now allow, at least in principal, an almost limitless series of marker-less knockouts to be made in a single strain, as well as the introduction into the chromosome of very large amounts of foreign DNA. While proof of principle has usually been with E. coli, many of these can, and have, been extended to other gram negative and even gram positive bacteria, heralding a new age in metabolic engineering. The key to making strains with multiple specific deletions is the use of phage encoded site-specific recombination systems; FLP/FRT, Cre/Lox, or λ Xis/Int. The introduction of a specific short recombination site (FRT, Lox, Int) allows subsequent manipulation, usually excision, when the cognate excisase is expressed. This technology is quite powerful and even allows in vitro cloning in the absence of restriction enzymes or ligase (Hartley et al., 2000). A very useful additional tool is the use of special recombinases, for example, Red from λ along with inhibition of host RecBCD. This permits transformation with PCR products that have an antibiotic resistance marker flanked by recognition sites and as little as 40 to 50bp of homology with the host genome at each end (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000; Yu et al., 2000). The power and simplicity of this method, called recombineering, which allows insertional inactivation without intermediate cloning steps, are demonstrated by the construction of a library (the Keio collection) of E. coli where all non-essential genes have been interrupted (Baba et al., 2006). This system has been well developed for E. coli and closely related organisms (Sharan et al., 2009). This technology has recently been taken to the next level by the demonstration of trackable multiplex recombineering (TRMR) where thousands of genetic modifications, virtually covering the entire genome, can be made and assessed simultaneously, essentially allowing the complete remodeling of a microbial genome in a week (Warner et al., 2010). However, even though phage functions related to the Red recombinase are found in some other bacteria, this system does not seem widely applicable to a variety of organisms. On the other hand, site-specific recombination using a phage derived site-specific recombinase and the cognate palindromic recognition site has proved to be a powerful genetic tool. For example the Cre-Lox system, paradoxically widely applied in plant and animal systems first, is now being shown to be useful in a variety of gram negative and gram positive organisms for gene inactivation or the generation of large chromosomal rearrangements (Lambert et al., 2007; Leibig et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2008; Ullrich and Schüler, 2010; Fontaine et al., 2010). A possible disadvantage of these systems is that multiple rounds of inactivation/excision can introduce a degree of genetic instability since recombination will leave behind either reconstituted recognition sites, allowing for another round of binding by the recombinase and/or multiple scars, regions long enough to permit homologous recombination. This can be avoided to a large extent with the Cre-Lox system since the Lox sites can be made such that Lox71 is generated by Cre action and Lox71 shows greatly decreased binding by Cre. In addition to metabolic pathway manipulation through gene inactivation, it is often desirable to add new genetic capabilities. While sometimes this can be done by transformation with a plasmid expressing the gene of interest, or even multiple plasmids (if they have compatible origins of replication), or a plasmid with a synthetic operon for the pathway of interest (Akhtar and Jones, 2008), this approach has many limiting factors including problems with plasmid maintenance and, eventually, size restrictions. One way around this problem would be the use of BACs (Bacterial artificial chromosomes), which can carry large amounts (ca. 300kb) of alien DNA while at the same time being stably maintained as a single copy in the bacterial cell. However, BACs are based on the F-factor, and thus their use is restricted to E. coli or closely related species. An alternative is the genetic manipulation of large pieces of DNA, with large, or multiple operons, using the recombination technology discussed above, followed by introduction into a foreign genome through homologous recombination after transfer by transformation or conjugation. If an interspecies system of conjugation is available this is probably the preferred route for the transfer of large DNA fragments. The heterologous DNA can be introduced at so-called neutral sites provided by phage attachment sites, cryptic prophages, IS elements, etc. However, this approach depends upon the ability of the host cell to efficiently carryout homologous recombination. Recently, the transfer of large DNA fragments (58kb) by transposition, a process that does not require homologous recombination, has been described (Fu et al., 2008). Finally, to be successful, metabolic engineering efforts should be intelligently guided. For initial simple modifications, alterations are usually obvious and straight forward. Even then, unforeseen consequences can arise due to activation of alternative pathways, metabolic shifts brought about by changes in metabolite pools, or unexpected activities of known enzymes. Efforts to affect major changes in existing pathways or to introduce of novel pathways could greatly benefit from knowledge of the existing metabolic fluxes and metabolimics (Baran et al., 2009; Zamboni and Sauer, 2009). This information combined with the increasingly available genomics information will allow the building of more accurate metabolic models (Durot et al., 2009) permitting the subsequent rational design of organisms with the desired characteristics (Tyo et al., 2010). Many computational frameworks, such as OptKnock, OptStrain, and OptReg, have been developed in order to find the optimum modulation and deletion strategies for the overproduction of fuels and chemicals (Burgard et al., 2003; Pharkya et al., 2004; Pharkya and Maranas, 2006). In what follows, we examine how some of these various metabolic engineering tools have been applied to hydrogen production through dark fermentation and suggest ways in which the latest generation of technologies can be brought to bear on surpassing present limitations."
2,Engineering efficient hydrogenases,"Hydrogenases are divided into three main groups based on their metallocenter composition: [NiFe] hydrogenases, [FeFe] hydrogenases and [Fe] hydrogenases (Vignais et al., 2001; Vignais and Colbeau, 2004; Meyer, 2007). Nitrogenase is also capable of hydrogen production, but hydrogenases are more than 1000 times more efficient than nitrogenase. Both [NiFe]-hydrogenases and [FeFe]-hydrogenases can be involved in hydrogen evolution (Vignais et al., 2001). The functional core of hydrogen-evolving enzymes is an active site formed of complex metallo-clusters whose synthesis and insertion in a special protein maturation process require a number of accessory gene products. The most efficient hydrogen-producing enzymes are [FeFe]-hydrogenases, which can have an activity about 10–100 times higher than that of [NiFe]-hydrogenases. [FeFe]-hydrogenases usually function to evolve hydrogen, but depending upon cellular circuitry can consume hydrogen (Hallenbeck, 2009). In fact, genomic analysis shows that there is a great deal of variety in [FeFe] hydrogenases, with some clostridia containing a large number of hydrogenases with different modular structures (Calusinska et al., 2010). Many organisms have been found to contain [Ni–Fe] or [Ni–Fe–Se] hydrogenases which mainly act as an “uptake” hydrogenase, that is, a hydrogenase whose normal metabolic function is to derive reductant from hydrogen. However, some, for example hydrogenase 3 of the formate hydrogen lyase complex of enteric bacteria, function to evolve hydrogen. These enzymes, especially [FeFe] hydrogenase, are generally sensitive to oxygen, and must be either spatially or temporally separated from it in order to produce hydrogen at optimal rates. One approach that has been tried in order to enhance hydrogen productivity is engineering the production of a stable hydrogenase through expression in a heterologous host. As well, since the hydrogen yield is low in many organisms containing an uptake hydrogenase, knocking out the genes encoding uptake hydrogenases has also been performed in order to enhance hydrogen production. Different examples of the heterologous expression of hydrogenase are given in Table 1 . E. coli is an ideal microorganism commonly used in genetic engineering due to its well-characterized genome, well known metabolism, and its ability to utilize a wide range of carbon sources including hexoses and pentoses. In addition, a metabolic pathway database, EcoCyc, is available, allowing for metabolic pathway prediction (Keseler et al., 2005). In addition, E. coli has potential advantages over at least some other microorganisms in that it exhibits rapid growth and has simple nutritional requirements as well as tolerance to oxygen (Hallenbeck, in press). E. coli possess four [Ni–Fe] hydrogenases. Two hydrogenases, hydrogenase 1 and 2 encoded by the hya and hyb operons, are involved in periplasmic hydrogen uptake. Two others, hydrogenase 3 and 4, are part of cytoplasmically oriented formate hydrogenase complexes (Vignais et al., 2001; Self et al., 2004). Hydrogenase 3, encoded by the hyc operon, produces hydrogen from formate as a part of the formate hydrogen lyase complex (FHL-1), which is active in hydrogen production during mixed-acid fermentation at acidic pHs. Hydrogenase 4, encoded by the hyf operon, appears to be cryptic under normal circumstances (Self et al., 2004). Maeda et al. (2007a) reported enhanced hydrogen production in E. coli cells expressing the bidirectional hydrogenase (encoded by hoxEFUYH) from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. It was suggested that the up to 41-fold increase in hydrogen yields was caused by suppression of the hydrogen uptake activity of hydrogenase 1 and 2, although it is difficult to see by what mechanism this might occur. One straight forward means to increase hydrogen yields by decreasing hydrogen uptake activities is to create strains carrying a double deletion of hydrogenase 1 and 2 (reviewed in Mathews and Wang, 2009). Likewise, improvements in hydrogen accumulation can be sought by disrupting the maturation of uptake hydrogenases. Inactivation of the Tat system prevents correct assembly of the uptake hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases in the cytoplasmic membrane, and leads to an increase in formate-dependent hydrogen evolution (Penfold et al., 2006). HycE, the large subunit of hydrogenase 3, has been subjected to random protein engineering for increased hydrogen evolution by error-prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR) and DNA shuffling (Maeda et al., 2008a). Seven HycE variants with enhanced hydrogen production were obtained that had a 74-amino acid carboxy-terminal truncation and similar results were found with saturation mutagenesis of HycET366. Thus, deletion of 204 amino acids at the carboxy terminus increases hydrogen production by 30-fold. The small subunit of the uptake hydrogenase encoded by hybO, was targeted for genetic knockout in the E. aerogenes genome for improving the hydrogen production. The pYM-Red recombination system was used to create mutant strain IAM1183-O (Δ hybO), which showed somewhat higher maximum specific hydrogen production (18%) and hydrogen yield (∼20%). Of course, another way to potentially increase hydrogen production would be through the heterologous expression of hydrogenase. Many early attempts to express a [FeFe] hydrogenase in E. coli by overexpressing hydA from organisms such as Clostridium were unsuccessful and remained unreported. Later it was shown that in order to successfully express functional [FeFe] hydrogenase it is also necessary to co-express three maturation genes, hydE, hydF, and hydG, that are required for H-cluster maturation and insertion if the organism does not possess these genes (i.e. E. coli) (Posewitz et al., 2004). Thus, reports of hydrogenase activity where these additional genes were not expressed (Karube et al., 1983; Chittibabu et al., 2006), are highly suspect. A stable [FeFe] hydrogenase expression system has been achieved for E. coli by coexpression of hydE, hydF, and hydG from the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum. Coexpression of the C. acetobutylicum maturation proteins with various algal and bacterial [FeFe] hydrogenases results in enzymes with specific activities similar to those purified from native sources. Thus, it appears that the hydrogenase catalytic domain and a functionally complete set of Hyd maturation proteins are necessary and sufficient for biosynthesis of catalytically active [FeFe] hydrogenases in E. coli (King et al., 2006). On the other hand, heterologous expression of hydA is simpler and possible without the heterologous expression of the accessory genes if these are encoded by the host genome. Thus, the hydrogenase gene (hydA) alone from Enterobacter cloacae (IIT-BT 08) could be expressed in the hydrogen-producing strain of E. aerogenes (ATCC13408), essentially doubling the hydrogen yield (Zhao et al., 2010). Although E. coli is perhaps the most useful organism as a target for metabolic engineering, lack of any NADH-dependent hydrogenases is one major hurdle for the engineering of hydrogen metabolism in this organism. Several types of NAD(P)H-dependent hydrogenases are known, from soluble [NiFe] hydrogenases (Ralstonia) to [FeFe] hydrogenases, such as the Hnd (hndA, hndB, hndC, and hndD) NADP-reducing hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio fructosovorans (Malki et al., 1995). However, until recently there were no credible reports of the heterologous expression of this class of hydrogenase in E. coli. Very recently, the successful expression in E. coli of a recombinant cytoplasmic, NADP-dependent hydrogenase from Pyrococcus furiosus, an anaerobic hyperthermophile, was demonstrated. Remarkably, the native E. coli maturation machinery could also generate a functional hydrogenase when provided with only the genes encoding the hydrogenase subunits and a single protease from P. furiosus, the hydrogenase-specific protease required for C-terminal cleavage during insertion of the NiFe active site (Sun et al., 2010)."

4,"Homologous recombination, overexpression, and antisense RNA","4.1 Homologous recombination, overexpression, and antisense RNA Only a few studies on genetic engineering of clostridia have been reported to date (Table 2 ). One of the most commonly used methods for performing metabolic engineering is the homologous recombination knockout of chromosomal genes. Inactivation of ack (encoding acetate kinase) Clostridium tyrobutyricum was reported to give a 1.5-fold enhancement in hydrogen production from glucose (Liu et al., 2006). Other studies have examined the effect of homologous and heterologous expression of particular genes on hydrogen production rates and yields. The effects of the overexpression of endogenous [FeFe] hydrogenase on whole cell hydrogen evolution were examined with Clostridium paraputrificum M-21. Hydrogen gas productivity of the recombinant was increased up to 1.7-fold compared with the wild-type (Morimoto et al., 2005). In C. tyrobutyricum JM1, homologous overexpression of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase resulted in 1.7-fold and 1.5-fold increases in hydrogenase activity and hydrogen yield, respectively (Jo et al., 2010). In both cases, hydrogen yields increased and lactate production decreased significantly. This inverse relation between hydrogen production and lactate production can be predicted from the known metabolic pathways (Fig. 2 ) and has recently been proven in Thermoanaerobacterium, where a deletion of ldhA was shown to increase hydrogen production by 2-fold (Li et al., 2010). Antisense RNA has also been used to downregulate uptake hydrogenase gene expression (hupCBA operon) in Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum strain N1–4. Hydrogen uptake activity decreased significantly, causing a 3.1-fold increase in hydrogen production (Nakayama et al., 2008). Despite of a long history of research on Clostridium, there are still key pathways of primary metabolism that remain unresolved. In particular, as is common for most anaerobic bacteria, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle remains ill-defined (Lee et al., 2008). While genome annotation of C. acetobutylicum suggests the absence of most tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, it has been shown using isotope tracers, mass spectrometry, and quantitative flux modeling that this bacterium has a complete, albeit bifurcated, TCA cycle (Amador-Noguez et al., 2010). The advantage of bidirectional flux into succinate is unclear; one possibility is that a bifurcated TCA cycle ending in succinate plays a role in cellular redox balance, another is that this facilitates the utilization of certain amino acids as nitrogen sources."
5,Gene inactivation using the ClosTronsystem and pMTL80000 shuttle vectors,"4.2 Gene inactivation using the ClosTronsystem and pMTL80000 shuttle vectors Prior to 2007, clostridial mutants were constructed almost entirely by homologous recombination. Recently, ClosTron, a Group II intron directed mutagenesis system for clostridia, was developed (Heap et al., 2007). The bacterial group II introns are a relatively newly characterized type of mobile element which can be used for the directed construction of stable mutants (Lambowitz and Zirnmerly, 2004). The mobile group II intron from the ltrB gene of Lactococcus lactis (Ll.ltrB) can insert into a specific target site via an RNA-mediated ‘retrohoming’ mechanism, achieved primarily by base-pairing between the excised intron lariat RNA and the target site D. Therefore, introns can be reprogrammed to the appropriate target site by alteration of the DNA sequence of the appropriate part of the intron. Recently, several significant improvements have been made in The ClosTronsystem has been improved recently to allow the construction of strains with multiple mutations through marker recycling using FLP/FRT, or delivery of trans genes to the chromosome (Heap et al., 2010). Automated ClosTron design bioinformatics and information about pMTL80000 modular plasmids are now available online (http://clostron.com). This group II intron delivery system has now been successfully used in Clostridium difficile, C. acetobutylicum, Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium beijerinckii and Clostridium perfringens. In addition, a modular system of Clostridium–E. coli shuttle plasmids called pMTL80000 is now available (Heap et al., 2009). With different Gram+replicons, selectable markers, Gram−replicons and specific application elements, a total of 400 different vectors can be constructed into which additional elements can be inserted using four unique rare restriction sites. This very flexible system allows researchers to identify combinations of components potentially suitable for particular clostridial hosts and applications. These newly developed and described tools open the door for the engineering of a variety of pathways to increase biofuels, including hydrogen, production. As yet, no studies to this effect have been reported."
6,Genetic manipulation in thermophillic clostridia,"4.3 Genetic manipulation in thermophillic clostridia Although group II intron technology has been used to inactivate gene targets in clostridia that were previously regarded as genetically intractable, the systems described to date have a temperature restriction that make such approaches incompatible with thermophilic clostridia. Of particular interest as a target for metabolic engineering is Clostridium thermocellum, a promising anaerobic hydrogen producing bacterium capable of rapid cellulose degradation (Levin et al., 2006). Recently, a gene deletion system using a native dual selection marker around pyrF was developed for C. thermocellum (Tripathi et al., 2010). The ΔpyrF strain, a uracil auxotroph, can be restored to prototrophy via the ectopic expression of pyrF from a plasmid, providing a positive genetic selection. A toxic uracil analog, 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) can be used to select against plasmid expressed pyrF, creating a selection pressure for plasmid loss. Development of the pyrF-based genetic selections along with the elaboration of a reliable simplified electroporation-based transformation protocol, removes a significant barrier to routine transformation and genetic manipulation of C. thermocellum. Proof of principle for the application of these newly described genetic tools in the context of metabolic engineering was shown by deleting pta, thus creating a C. thermocellum strain that does not produce acetate (Tripathi et al., 2010). Since the genome sequence of C. thermocellum ATCC24705 is available, the field is now ripe for the application of metabolic engineering to the further development of C. thermocellum and related organisms as biocatalysts for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biohydrogen."
7,New perspectives in metabolic engineering for clostridia,"4.4 New perspectives in metabolic engineering for clostridia Flow cytometry (FC) technologies, including fluorescence assisted cell-sorting (FSC), have the potential to greatly accelerate the development and analysis of the complex microbial phenotypes that might be produced through application of the modern powerful techniques of metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, and evolutionary engineering (Tracy et al., 2010). FC-FISH (Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization) can be used as a rapid screening tool to identify organisms with particular 16S-rRNA or desired mRNA characteristics, for example, the dominate hydrogen producing cells of a mixed culture. Indeed, in one study, FLOW-FISH with oligomer probes designed to target clostridial hydrogenase genes was used as a screening tool to find hydrogen-producing clostridial species (Jen et al., 2007). Multiparametric flow cytometry is a powerful technique capable of the detection of a variety of metabolic activities and thus has the potential to provide great insight into the physiology of individual cells as well as populations of bacterial cells. Previously, it has been used for the study of the endospore-forming bacterium C. acetobutylicum where the morphologies and metabolic states of wild-type C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824, strain 824 (pSOS95del) and the asporogenous strain M5 were analysed (Tracy et al., 2008). The results generated strong evidence that challenges the long-accepted view in the field that the clostridial cell form is the solvent-forming phenotype. As the percentage of rod-shaped cells decreased and the clostridial-forms increased, butanol production and organic acid uptake rates decreased, suggesting that sporulation detracts from solvent production and that clostridial-form cells are not the major butanol-producing phenotype. Thus, in the future, multiparametric FC (MPF) could also be used to assess viability and improve the discrimination of physiological states in order to correlate phenotypes with metabolic flux analysis leading to hypotheses about which cell morphology is mainly responsible for hydrogen production."
8,Metabolic engineering of hydrogen production by facultative anaerobes,"In the past, many studies have attempted to optimize hydrogen production through metabolic engineering of E. coli. Some powerful new tools have now become available for metabolic engineering studies with E. coli. As discussed previously, simple and highly efficient disruption of chromosomal genes have allowed the creation of “Keio” and “ASKA” collections, valuable new resources for metabolic engineering allowing; the systematic analysis of unknown gene function, gene regulatory networks, and genome-wide testing of mutational effects in a common background. Different metabolic engineering strategies for increasing biohydrogen production under dark fermentative conditions have been described (Fig. 3 and Table 3 ). Some of these involve the disruption of lactate and/or succinate production. These studies show that hydrogen production is increased by directing carbon flow into making formate. Thus an FHL over-expressing E. coli strain (deleted for the FHL repressor gene (hycA) and containing a plasmid that overexpresses (fhlA) shows increased hydrogen yields in the E. coliSR15 strains lacking lactate and succinate production (Yoshida et al., 2006, 2007). Likewise, Penfold et al. (2003) developed a hycA null E. coli strain HD701 which has 14-fold increase in hydrogen production over wild type, especially when it had been grown in low glucose concentrations. Similarly, a strain, DJT135, in which ldhA has been inactivated and that activates the formate regulon since it expresses a N-terminally truncated FhlA, has been shown to be capable of producing nearly 2moles hydrogen/mole glucose (Bisaillon et al., 2006; Turcot et al., 2008). Thus, the over-expression of the FHL complex leads to greater hydrogen production and this can be achieved by either eliminating the repressor HycA or truncating the N-terminus of FhlA making it formate-independant and causing it to activate the hyc operon (Self et al., 2001). Maeda et al. (2007b) performed successive rounds of P1 transduction from the Keio E. coli K-12 library to introduce multiple, stable mutations into a single bacterium to direct metabolic flux towards hydrogen production. The regulation of FHL was altered by inactivating the repressor hycA and by overexpressing the activator encoded by fhlA, eliminating hydrogen uptake activity eliminated by deleting hyaB (hydrogenase 1) and hybC (hydrogenase 2), redirecting glucose metabolism to formate using mutations in fdnG, fdoG, narG, focA, focB, poxB, and aceE, and production of succinate and lactate eliminated by deleting frdC and ldhA. The best of the metabolically engineered strains, BW25113 hyaB hybC hycA fdoG frdC ldhA aceE, showed a 4.6-fold increased hydrogen production from glucose with a 2-fold increased hydrogen yield (0.65–1.3moles H2/mole glucose). Likewise, a similar strain construction gave a mutant with 141-fold increased hydrogen production from formate, achieving the theoretical yield for hydrogen from formate (Maeda et al., 2008b). In addition, the hydrogen yield from glucose was increased by 50%, and there was threefold higher hydrogen production from glucose with this mutant. Up until now, most of the modifications have been at the single gene level, or at most operons, and little is known about how changes in global regulatory circuits could affect hydrogen production. For example, the modification of global transcriptional regulators to modulate the expression of multiple operons required for the biosynthesis of formate hydrogen lyase could represent one approach to improving hydrogen production. One study has shown that disruption of focA (formate transport) and narL or fnr (anaerobic metabolism regulators) gives modest increases in hydrogen production rates and yields (Fan et al., 2009). Finally, although one of the advantages of E. coli is its ability to produce hydrogen from a wide range of substrates (Ghosh and Hallenbeck, 2009), including sugars typically derived from deconstruction of lignocellulose, increasing its substrate range further would make accessible a number of potentially abundant substrates. For example, introduction of plasmid born invertase allows E. coli to produce hydrogen from sucrose, available in crude form as a waste product of the sugar refining industry (Penfold and Macaskie, 2004)."
9,Perspectives,"Ultimately, surpassing the metabolic barriers of 2moles H2/mole glucose (facultative anaerobes) or 4moles H2/mole glucose (strict anaerobes) will be required since incomplete substrate conversion is not competitive with the production of other biofuels from the same substrates and leaves behind substantial amounts of by products that would represent an enormous waste disposal problem. Some solutions to this problem could be provided by the development of two-stage systems, as discussed elsewhere (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009). In the context of metabolic engineering, extensive remodeling of existing pathways would be required to achieve anywhere near the theoretical stoichiometry of 12moles H2/mole glucose. As previously suggested, one possibility would be to gain additional energy and reducing power through limited respiration (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002; Hallenbeck, 2005; Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2010). A functioning TCA cycle allows for the complete dissimilation of glucose: C 6 H 12 O 6 + 10 NAD + + 2 FAD + 4 ADP + 6 H 2 O → 10 NADH + 10 H + + 2 FADH 2 + 6 CO 2 + 4 ATP While it might be suggested that 10moles of hydrogen could be derived directly from the NADH so produced: 10 NADH + 10 H + → 10 NAD + + 10 H 2 this is in fact thermodynamically unfavorable and additional energy must be added to the system to drive reverse electron transport to hydrogenase. This could of course be obtained by reoxidation of the FADH2 by the respiratory chain, generating either additional ATP or an electrochemical gradient: 2 FADH 2 + O 2 + 4 ADP → 2 FAD + 2 H 2 O + 4 ATP . The net effect would be to generate 10moles of H2 per mole of glucose: C 6 H 12 O 6 + 8 ADP + O 2 + 4 H 2 O → 10 H 2 + 6 CO 2 + 8 ATP Of course, a number of modifications would be required to achieve this, among them the introduction of mutations in NADH dehydrogenase and the ability of hydrogenase to function under microaerobic conditions. Achieving this, or introducing other high-yielding pathways, is the critical challenge for the metabolic engineering of hydrogen production by dark fermentation."
10,Conclusions,"Dark fermentation holds promise as a technology to convert a variety of lignocellulosic residues or various waste streams to hydrogen. However, although diverse organisms with different metabolic pathways are naturally capable of hydrogen fermentations, none can do so at acceptable yields. Thus there is a need for metabolic engineering to overcome this barrier and past attempts at metabolic engineering at the level of single genes have provided proof of principal for this approach. Recent advances in the metabolic engineering tool box suggest that more extensive future modifications could result in novel organism capable of producing hydrogen at high yields."
