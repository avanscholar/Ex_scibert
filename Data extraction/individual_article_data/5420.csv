0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a globally accepted clean and environmentally benign energy carrier for heating, transportation, mechanical power and electricity generation [1]. However, hydrogen production and storage are two major hurdles for a widespread use of hydrogen for the implementation of hydrogen economy [2]. Among the tested solid storage materials, chemical hydrogen storage materials with high gravimetric hydrogen density and low molecular weight are highly promising ones [3]. Hydrazine borane (N2H4BH3) with 15.4 wt % gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity that exceeds the 2015 targets of US DOE of 7 wt % [4] has recently been studied as a novel hydrogen storage material and releases 4.4 wt % of it by hydrolysis under the catalytic conditions here. It efficiently releases hydrogen at room temperature in the presence of suitable catalysts via hydrolytic dehydrogenation reaction according to Eq. (1): (1) N 2 H 4 BH 3 ( s ) + 2 H 2 O ( I ) → RT catalyst N 2 H 5 + ( aq ) + BO 2 − ( aq ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) Only few catalyst systems including Ni0.89Pt0.11 nanoparticles [5], rhodium(III) chloride salt [6], hydroxyapatite-supported rhodium nanoparticles [7], nickel-based bimetallic nanocatalysts [8], rhodium–nickel catalysts [9], poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid)-stabilized nickel nanoparticles [10], supported Ni@(RhNi alloy) nanocomposites [11], nickel- and platinum-containing core–shell catalysts [12], surfactant-free nickel–platinum nanocatalysts [13], core–shell Cu@SiO2 nanospheres [14], and poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid)-stabilized cobalt nanoparticles [15] have been tested for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane so far. Here, we report the first time use of efficient poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized palladium nanoparticles (Pd@PVP NPs) in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane for hydrogen generation. The catalyst has been prepared by the reduction of an appropriate palladium salt in the presence of PVP at reflux temperature. Pd@PVP NPs stable as colloidal dispersions are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV–Vis spectroscopy. Although the cost of noble metal catalysts is assumed to be high, the highest catalytic activity of the Pd@PVP NPs makes them very promising candidates to be used as catalyst in developing efficient portable hydrogen generation systems using hydrazine borane as solid hydrogen storage material since it would easily compensate the cost concerns."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Potassium tetrachloropalladate(II) (K2PdCl4), poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP-40), hydrazine hemisulfate salt (N2H4∙0.5H2SO4), sodium borohydride, and 1,4-dioxane were purchased from Aldrich. Ethanol was purchased from Merck. Deionized water was distilled by water purification system (Milli Q-pure WS). All glassware and teflon coated magnetic stir bars were rinsed with acetone, followed by copious washing with distilled water before drying in an oven at 150 °C."
3,Preparation of Pd@PVP nanoparticles,"2.2 Preparation of Pd@PVP nanoparticles Pd@PVP nanoparticles were prepared by an alcohol reduction method in which PVP serves as both stabilizer and reducing agent. To a solution of potassium tetrachloropalladate(II) (0.25 mmol in 50 mL water/ethanol mixture), poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP-40, 2.5 mmol of monomeric units) was added. Then, the resulting mixture was refluxed at 90 °C for 2 h. Pd@PVP nanoparticles are brownish black in color and stable at room temperature for a long time."
4,Characterization of Pd@PVP nanoparticles,"2.3 Characterization of Pd@PVP nanoparticles 2.3.1 UV–Vis analysis UV–Vis spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 (Varian) UV–Vis spectrophotometer. A quartz cell with a part length of 1 cm was used and spectra were collected over the range of 200–900 nm. 2.3.2 TEM analysis Transmission Electron Microscopy analysis was carried out using a JEOL-2010 microscope operating at 200 kV, fitted with a LaB6 filament and has lattice and theoretical point resolutions of 0.14 nm and 0.23 nm, respectively. Samples were examined at magnification between 100 and 400 K. One drop of dilute suspension of sample was deposited on the TEM grids and the solvent was then evaporated. The diameter of each particle was determined from the enlarged photographs. 2.3.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy X-ray photoelectron spectrum of the nanoparticles was taken by using SPECS spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical analyzer and using monochromatic Mg-Kα radiation (1250 eV, the X-ray tube working at 15 kV and 350 W). 2.3.4 11B NMR spectra 11B NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DPX 400 MHz spectrometer. At the end of the hydrolysis reaction, the resulting solutions were filtered and the filtrates used for taking 11B NMR spectra."
5,Synthesis and characterization of hydrazine borane (N2H4BH3),"2.4 Synthesis and characterization of hydrazine borane (N2H4BH3) Hydrazine borane (N2H4BH3) was synthesized from the reaction of hydrazine hemisulfate with sodium borohydride in 1,4-dioxane following the literature procedures [16,17]. The melting point of hydrazine borane is ∼60 °C. 1H NMR (400.1 MHz, CD2Cl2): 5.1 ppm (t, 2, NH2–NH2–BH3), 3.4 ppm (b, 2, H2N–NH2–BH3), 1.2 ppm (t, 3, H2N–NH2–BH3); 11B NMR (128.2 MHz, H2O): −20 ppm (q, BH3); ATR-IR: 3310 (s), 3200 (s), 2840 (m), 2650 (m), 2370 (m), 2214 (m), 1620 (s), 1588 (m), 1435 (w), 1332 (m), 1150 (s), 910 (m), 747 (w) in good agreement with the literature values [17]."
6,Catalytic evaluation of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane,"2.5 Catalytic evaluation of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane The catalytic activity of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane in aqueous solution was determined by measuring the rate of hydrogen generation. In all the experiments, a jacketed reaction flask (50 mL) containing a Teflon-coated stir bar was placed on a magnetic stirrer (Heidolph MR-301) and thermostated to 25.0 ± 0.1 °C by circulating water through its jacket from a constant temperature bath. Then, a graduated glass tube filled with water was connected to the reaction flask to measure the volume of the hydrogen gas to be evolved from the reaction. In a typical experiment, 46 mg (1 mmol) of N2H4BH3 was dissolved in x mL of water. The solution was transferred with a glass pipet into the reaction flask thermostated at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. Then, aliquots of Pd@PVP nanoparticles (10-x mL) from the stock solution (5.0 mM) were added into the reaction flask. The experiment was started by closing the flask and the volume of hydrogen gas evolved was measured by recording the displacement of water level at the stirring speed of 1000 rpm. In addition to the volumetric measurement of the hydrogen evolution, the conversion of HB (δ = −20 ppm, q) to hydrazinium metaborate (δ = 12.5 ppm, s) was also checked by 11B NMR spectroscopy."
7,The effect of stirring speed on hydrogen generation rate,"2.6 The effect of stirring speed on hydrogen generation rate The same experiments described in the Section 2.5 for the hydrogen generation from the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine were performed at 25 ± 0.1 °C by varying the stirring speed (0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 rpm) to check how hydrogen generation rate from the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane system was affected by stirring speed. The hydrogen generation rate was found to be independent of the stirring speed when it is higher than 800 rpm. This indicates that the system is in a non-mass transfer limitation regime since the present kinetic study was performed at the stirring speed of 1000 rpm."
8,Determination of the activation energy of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane,"2.7 Determination of the activation energy of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane In a typical experiment, the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of N2H4BH3 (100 mM) catalyzed by Pd@PVP nanoparticles (0.6 mM) was performed by following the same procedure described in Section 2.5 at various temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, 35 °C). The values of observed rate constants (kobs) for the catalytic hydrolytic dehydrogenation of N2H4BH3 were calculated from linear portions of each temperature and used to determine the activation energy (Ea)."
9,Durability of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane,"2.8 Durability of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane The durability of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane was determined by a series of experiments started with a 10 mL solution containing 0.6 mM Pd@PVP nanoparticles and 100 mM N2H4BH3 at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. When the complete conversion is achieved, another equivalent of N2H4BH3 was added to the reaction mixture immediately. The results were expressed as % initial catalytic activity of Pd@PVP nanoparticles and % conversion of hydrazine borane versus the number of catalytic runs in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of N2H4BH3 solution."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Preparation and characterization of Pd@PVP nanoparticles,"3.1 Preparation and characterization of Pd@PVP nanoparticles Pd@PVP nanoparticles were prepared from the reduction of potassium tetrachloropalladate(II) by an alcohol reduction method in the presence of PVP in ethanol–water mixture at refluxing temperature. PVP serves as stabilizer and reducing agent. After refluxing for 2 h, the color of the solution turned to brownish black, indicating reduction of Pd2+ ion to Pd0 to form nanoparticles. Monitoring the UV–Vis electronic absorption spectra of the solution provides the best way to follow this conversion. Fig. 1 shows the spectral change during the formation of Pd nanoparticles from the reduction of corresponding palladium salt by PVP. The absorption bands due to d–d transitions in Pd2+ ion completely disappear after refluxing the solution, indicating the complete reduction of corresponding ion. The size, morphology and composition of Pd@PVP nanoparticles were investigated by TEM analysis. Fig. 2 shows the TEM image taken at 20 nm magnification of Pd@PVP nanoparticles. The mean particle size was determined as 3.5 ± 1.0 nm from TEM image by counting 176 particles. Fig. 3 shows the survey scan (Fig. 3a) XPS spectrum of Pd@PVP nanoparticles and high resolution XPS spectra of Pd 3d (Fig. 3b) region. Pd 3d region shows two peaks observed at 334.6 eV for 3d5/2 and 339.7 eV for 3d3/2, confirming the presence of Pd(0) [18]. There is no higher oxidation state peaks for the catalyst in the XPS spectrum, indicating the protection of Pd(0) species by the attachment of PVP during catalyst preparation procedure."
12,Catalytic evaluation of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane,"3.2 Catalytic evaluation of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane Pd@PVP nanoparticles were found to be highly efficient catalyst for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane. Fig. 4 shows the plot of mol H2/mol N2H4BH3 versus time for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of 100 mM N2H4BH3 solutions in the presence of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in different catalyst concentrations (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mM) at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. The linear hydrogen generation starts immediately without an induction period and continues until the complete hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane. The conversion of hydrazine borane (δ = −20 ppm, q) to hydrazinium metaborate (δ = 12.5 ppm, s) was also checked by 11B NMR spectroscopy. The hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane catalyzed by Pd@PVP nanoparticles was also carried out at various temperatures to determine the activation energy. Fig. 5 shows the plots mol H2/mol N2H4BH3 versus time in the catalytic hydrolytic dehydrogenation of 100 mM N2H4BH3 solutions in the presence of Pd@PVP nanoparticles (0.6 mM) at various temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, 35 °C). It is worth to note that using Pd@PVP nanoparticles (1.0 mM) leads to complete hydrogen release (3.0 mol H2/mol N2H4BH3) for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of N2H4BH3 within 7 min, corresponding to an average TOF value of 42.9 min−1 at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. This TOF value is much more higher than that of RhNi catalyst (1.5 min−1) [9], poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid)-stabilized nickel nanoparticles (3.05 min−1) [10], core–shell Cu@SiO2 nanospheres (7.58 min−1) [14], and poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid)-stabilized cobalt nanoparticles (6.2 min−1) [15]. The rate constants (Table 1 ) of hydrogen generation from the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane were calculated from the linear portions of the plots given in Fig. 5 at five different temperatures and used for the calculation of the activation energy (E a = 54.5 ± 2 kJ mol−1) from the Arrhenius plot (Fig. 6 ) for hydrolytic dehydrogenation reaction. This activation energy of 54.5 ± 2 kJ mol−1 for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of N2H4BH3 is lower than that of poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid)-stabilized nickel nanoparticles (73 ± 2 kJ mol−1) [10] and poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid)-stabilized cobalt nanoparticles (60 ± 2 kJ mol−1) [15], but higher than that of rhodium(III) chloride (44 ± 2 kJ mol−1) [6] and hydroxyapatite-supported rhodium nanoparticles (45 ± 2 kJ mol−1) [7]."
13,The durability of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane,"3.3 The durability of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane The durability of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane was investigated by successive additions of N2H4BH3 after the first cycle of the hydrolytic dehydrogenation reaction. The Pd@PVP nanoparticles catalyst retains 79% of its initial catalytic activity in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of N2H4BH3, even at the sixth run (Fig. 7 ). The slight decrease in the catalytic activity of Pd@PVP nanoparticles in each run is most probably due to the passivation of nanoparticles' surface by increasing amount of metaborate, which decreases accessibility of active sites [19] and the aggregation of nanoparticles."
14,Conclusions,"This study of the preparation, characterization and employment of Pd@PVP nanoparticles as catalyst for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane has led to the following conclusions and insights: ✓ Pd@PVP nanoparticles are easily prepared from the reduction of corresponding palladium salt by an alcohol reduction method. ✓ Pd@PVP nanoparticles are found to be efficient catalysts for hydrogen generation from the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane. ✓ They provide an average TOF value of 42.9 min−1 for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane. ✓ Activation energy for the catalytic hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane in the presence of Pd@PVP nanoparticles was calculated as 54.5 ± 2 kJ mol−1. ✓ Pd@PVP nanoparticles may be regarded as promising catalysts with a high catalytic activity for practical applications to supply hydrogen from the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of hydrazine borane for proton exchange membrane fuel cells."
