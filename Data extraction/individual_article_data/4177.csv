0,Introduction,"Selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehyde, ketone or acid products is a pivotal transformation in fine chemicals and pharmaceutical industries. Catalytic oxidation systems have been focused from industrial and academic views [1,2]. Traditionally, stoichiometric amounts of oxidizing agents (e.g. MnO2, CrO3, K2Cr2O7, SeO2, etc) have been utilized under harsh reaction industrial conditions which caused environmental issues and increased production costs. Therefore, development of active and selective catalytic systems is a continuing demand for economic and sustainable chemical transformations [1,3]. There are some reports about development of catalysts based on supported noble metals such as Au [4], Pd [5], Ru [6] or a combination of them [7]. However, these catalysts are expensive and suffer from sustainable points of views [8]. Transition metal-based catalysts were also immobilized using supports including graphene oxide [9], polymers [10], metal nanoparticles [11] and silica [12]. For instance, there have been many reports on the catalytic oxidation of alcohols over supported Cu(II) complexes [13–16]. Coordination polymers and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with adjustable molecular structures and electronic properties, offer a plentiful supply of transition metals with catalytic characteristics. These materials are inorganic-organic hybrids assembled from metal ions or clusters which are held by organic linkers [17,18]. Unique features of these crystalline compounds such as uniform arrangement of catalytic sites with high concentration, stable architecture and reusability make them suitable candidates in the field of heterogeneous catalysis [19–21]. Copper (II)-coordination polymers and MOFs have been already proved to be promising catalysts for alcohol oxidation [22–26]. In this regard, we previously reported copper molybdate [CuMoO4(1,10-Phen)]. H2O (Phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) coordination polymer and Cu3(BTC)2 MOF (BTC = 1,3,5-tricarboxylate) as heterogeneous catalysts for epoxidation of allylic alcohols [27,28]. Recently, Rajeev Gupta’s group synthesized Cu(II)-coordination polymers containing metalloligands and applied them as heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol [29]. Catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol was also reported over other Cu(II)-based MOFs and coordination polymers such as Cu(1,4-BDC)(DABCO)0.5 (1,4-BDC = terephthalic acid) [30] and Cu3(BTC)2 [23], {[Cu(fcz)2(H2O)]·SO4. DMF.2CH3OH·2H2O}n and {[Cu(fcz)2Cl2]·2CH3OH}n (fcz = 1-(2,4 difluorophenyl)-1,1-bis[(1H-1,2,4-triazol-l-yl)methyl]ethanol) [22]. Herein, we report solvothermal self-assembly synthesis and structural features of new 1-D, 2-D and 3-D coordination polymers based on Cu(II) paddle-wheel SBUs including Cu2(μ2-MeCO2)4(DABCO) (1), [Cu(1,4-BDC-Br)(DABCO)0.5]. xDMF.yH2O (2) and Cu(1,4-BDC-OH)(DMF) (3). The prepared coordination polymers were applied as heterogeneous catalysts for oxidation of benzyl alcohol."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and characterization,"2.1 Materials and characterization All reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. FT-IR spectra were acquired by means of a Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer equipped with a single reflection diamond ATR system. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded on a PANalytical X’Pert PRO instrument using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was measured in N2 atmosphere using Dupont 951 Thermogravimetric Analyzer. The surface area and pore volume of MOF 2 were identified by nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements at liquid nitrogen temperature utilizing BELSORP-mini II instrument. The sample was degassed under vacuum at 130 °C for 4 h before the experiments. The oxidation products were determined using a gas chromatograph (HP, Agilent 5890) equipped with a capillary column (HP-1) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The copper content in the catalysts was measured by AA-400 atomic absorption spectrometer."
3,Synthesis of 1a and 2,"2.2 Synthesis of 1a and 2 A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.06 g, 0.25 mmol), DABCO (0.07 g, 0.62 mmol), 1,4-BDC-Br (0.044 g, 0.18 mmol) and CH3COOH (0.08 mL) was dissolved in DMF (5 mL) and then stirred for 10 min. The suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 110 °C for 24 h to afford a mixture of 1a and 2. Green parallelepiped crystals of 1a were settled at the bottom of the vessel and the above solution containing small crystals of 2 were isolated by decantation. Crystals of 1a and 2 were washed with fresh DMF and dried in air."

After stirring of the reagents for 10 min, the mixture was placed into a Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 120 °C for 24 h. Blue parallelepiped crystals of 1b were separated by filtration, washed with DMF and then dried in air."
5,Synthesis of 3,"2.4 Synthesis of 3 The 1,4-BDC-OH ligand was synthesized according to previous method reported in the literature [31]. To synthesize coordination polymer 3, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.08 g, 0.33 mmol) and 1,4-BDC-OH (0.046 g, 0.25 mmol) were added to a mixture of DMF (4 mL) and EtOH (1 mL) in a 25 mL Teflon container and then stirred for 10 min at room conditions. The mixture was kept in a stainless-steel autoclave at 80 °C for 24 h. After slow cooling of the vessel to room temperature, green crystals of 3 were collected and washed with DMF."
6,Catalytic procedure,"2.5 Catalytic procedure The oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out as follows: A mixture containing tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP, 2.26 mmol), benzyl alcohol (1 mmol) and catalyst (0.063 mmol based on Cu) in solvent (1 mL) was prepared. TBHP (70% in H2O) was dried prior to use based on the procedure reported in the literature using CH2Cl2 [32]. The mixture was stirred for proper time either at room temperature or at 40 °C and then the oxidation products were analyzed by GC."
7,X-ray single crystal data collection and refinement,"2.6 X-ray single crystal data collection and refinement Single-crystal structure analyses were carried out on a four-circle κ geometry KUMA KM-4 diffractometer equipped with a two-dimensional area CCD detector using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation. The structures were solved by the direct method using SHELXS-97 and refined using SHELXL-2014/7 program [33]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The CCDC numbers are 1571179 (1a), 1571178 (1b) and 1860730 (3)."
8,Result and discussion,
9,Crystal structures,"3.1 Crystal structures 3.1.1 Structure of Cu2(μ2-MeCO2)4(DABCO) (1a) Crystallographic data of the structures are given in Table 1 . The ORTEP diagram of 1a is illustrated in Fig. 1 a. Two Cu2+ ions, one DABCO molecule and four μ2-MeCO2 ligands exist in the asymmetric unit of this structure. There are two crystallographically distinct Cu2+ ions which are joined through linear DABCO ligand. Square pyramidal configuration around each Cu2+ center contains one N atom from a DABCO molecule in the axial site (Cu1–N1, 2.195(3); Cu2–N2, 2.196(3) Å) and four O atoms from four different μ2-MeCO2 ions. The Cu1–O and Cu2–O bond lengths are within the range of 1.966(2)-1.984(2) and 1.972(2)-1.989(2) Å, respectively (Table S1). The Cu2+ ions are further joined each other via bridging DABCO and μ2-MeCO2 ligands to form the 1-D chain depicted in Fig. 1b. The Cu1 …. Cu1 and Cu2 …. Cu2 distances within {Cu2(μ2-MeCO2)4} units are 2.6155(8) and 2.6142(8) Å, respectively. Some hydrogen bonding interactions are observed between H atoms of DABCO and O atoms of μ2-MeCO2 ligands in the chains (Table S2). In this structure, the chains grow along two different directions which led to the packing exhibited in Fig. 1c. The PXRD pattern of 1a, presented in Fig. 2 a, is similar to that of the simulated pattern, indicating the purity of the sample. 3.1.2 Structure of [Cu(1,4-BDC-Br)(DABCO)0.5].xDMF.yH2O (2) Since our effort for obtaining crystals suitable for structure determination by single-crystal X-ray diffraction resulted in failure, phase and purity of this compound were studied using PXRD. The pattern of 2 is similar to that of [Zn(1,4-BDC)(DABCO)0.5] MOF previously reported by Danil N. Dybtsev et al. [34], confirming that these two compounds are isostructural and the structure of the MOF is not affected by functionalization of 1,4-BDC (Fig. 2b). The molecular structure and 3D packing of [Zn(1,4-BDC)(DABCO)0.5] MOF are shown in Fig. 3 . The MOF contains binuclear-paddle wheel units bridged by 1,4-BDC and form 2D layers which are further connected by pillared DABCO ligands. 3.1.3 Structure of Cu2(μ2-MeCO2)4(DABCO) (1b) This structure is a polymorph of 1a. The molecular structure of binuclear 1b is shown in Fig. 4 a. The asymmetric unit of 1b is composed of one Cu2+ ion, one μ2-MeCO2 ion and half of a DABCO molecule. There is one crystallographically distinct Cu2+ ion which is coordinated to N atom of a DABCO molecule in the axial site. The carbon atoms of DABCO are disordered. The structure of 1b showed similar connectivity to that of 1a and Cu2+ centres are five-coordinated by N from DABCO ligand (Cu1–N1, 2.205(2) Å) and four O atoms from μ2-MeCO2 molecules with the Cu1–O bond lengths of 1.9684(16) and 1.9732(17) Å (Table S3). The binuclear units are joined together through linear DABCO molecules and form 1-D chain seen in Fig. 4b. The Cu …. Cu distance in the chain is 2.632(6) Å which is slightly longer compared to those in 1a. Unlike 1a, the chains in 1b are all aligned in a similar direction to afford the packing demonstrated in Fig. 4c. Similar paddle wheel units were reported in some MOFs synthesized based on DABCO and 1,4-BDC or functionalized 1,4-BDC including [Co2(1,4-BDC)2(DABCO)].4DMF.H2O [31,35], [Ni2(1,4-BDC)2(DABCO)].4DMF.H2O [36], [Cu2(1,4-BDC-NH2)2(DABCO)].2DMF.2H2O (1,4-BDC-NH2 = 2-aminoterephthalate) [37] and [Zn(1,4-BDC-OH)2(DABCO)0.5].1.5DMF.0.3H2O [31]. Acetate ions as monotopic carboxylate ligands in 1a and 1b afforded the formation of 1-D chains while the ditopic functionalized 1,4-BDC ligands in 2 as well as the previously reported structures mentioned above led to the formation of 3-D MOFs. Although 1,4-BDC-Br, DABCO and acetic acid were utilized in the solvothermal synthesis of 1a, the 1,4-BDC-Br does not appear in this structure and we obtained a mixture containing coordination polymer 1a and MOF 2. To investigate how 1,4-BDC-Br affects the final products, the synthesis was carried out under similar conditions to those mentioned above, except that 1,4-BDC-Br was omitted. Rod-shape crystals were formed which were not suitable for X-ray single crystal analysis. However, the PXRD pattern of these crystals is not similar to that of 1a (Fig. S1). Thus, we made an attempt to obtain better crystals for X-ray analysis by changing the reaction conditions such as molar ratio of the starting materials and the reaction temperature and this resulted in compound 1b. 3.1.4 Structure of Cu(1,4-BDC-OH)(DMF) (3) The ORTEP view of coordination polymer 3 is displayed in Fig. 5 a. The asymmetric unit in this structure is composed of one Cu2+ ion, half of a 1,4-BDC-OH and one DMF molecule. The OH group of 1,4-BDC-OH ligand occupies two positions (both with the occupancy of 0.5). The DMF molecules have also two orientations (occupancy of 0.5 for each) with two common atoms (O4 and C6). Each Cu2+ ion exhibits a square pyramidal configuration and is coordinated to four O atoms from four 1,4-BDC-OH ligands (Cu–O1, 1.948(2) Å; Cu–O2i, 1.971(2) Å; Cu–O2ii, 1.971(2) Å; Cu–O1iii, 1.948(2) Å (symmetry codes: (i) 2-x, y, 1-z; (ii) 2-x, 1-y, 1-z; (iii) x, 1-y, z) and one O atom of a DMF molecule in the axial position (Cu–O4, 2.135(4) Å). The bond lengths and angles for 3, shown in Table S4, lie within the range of those reported for similar paddle-wheel structures [38]. The paddle-wheel units with Cu ….Cu distances of 2.642 Å, are connected through the carboxylate groups of 1,4-BDC-OH ligand to form a 2D layer shown in Fig. 5b."
10,Spectroscopic analysis,"3.2 Spectroscopic analysis The FT-IR spectra of 1–3 are presented in Fig. 6 . In the FT-IR spectra of fresh 1a and 1b, the symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of COO groups for μ2-MeCO2 ligand are observed at 1417 and 1612 cm-1, respectively [39]. The ν (C–N) of DABCO ligand is seen at 1060 cm-1. In the FT-IR spectrum of MOF 2, νas (C–N) and νs (C–N) for DABCO appeared at 1089 and 1058 cm-1, respectively. Moreover, the bands located at 1623 and 1672 cm-1 are ascribed to the νas (COO) vibrations of 1,4-BDC-Br ligand. The peak at 1383 cm-1 can be assigned to νs (COO) of this ligand [36,40,41]. Similar to 2, the FT-IR spectra of 3 exhibited the bands for ν (COO) vibrations exist in the structure of 1,4-BDC-OH ligand."
11,Thermal stability,"3.3 Thermal stability Thermogravimetric analyses were conducted to evaluate thermal stability of 1–3 as shown in Fig. 7 . In coordination polymer 1a, the weight loss of approximately 4% up to 190 °C is probably due to adsorbed solvent molecules (DMF and/or H2O). One distinct weight loss step occurred upon heating to 300 °C owing to the decomposition of organic ligands. The residue of about 34% (calculated 33.46%) is attributed to copper oxide. In the TGA curve of MOF 2, the weight loss observed up to 230 °C is related to the solvent molecules occupying the pores of the MOF. Then the guest-free framework of 2 decomposes up to 510 °C due to the elimination of organic molecules. Coordination polymer 1b is stable up to 170 °C, followed by a one-step weight loss by increasing in the temperature to 270 °C, which is attributed to the removal of organic molecules. TG curve of 3 exhibits no weight loss till 210 °C and then is decomposed in two steps. The first weight loss of 22.66% (calculated 23%) observed at 210–280 °C can be due to one DMF molecule. The residue of 24.99% (calculated 25.11%) at 600 °C is related to copper oxide. Powder XRD analyses for 1–3 after annealing at 600 °C confirm that the residue is CuO (Figs. S2–S5)."
12,Textural analysis,"3.4 Textural analysis The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm and pore size distribution of MOF 2 are shown in Fig. 8 . The BET and Langmuir surface areas are estimated to be 1106 and 1211 m2g-1, respectively. Functionalization of 1,4-BDC by Br groups in MOF 2 provides a lower surface area compared to similar structures containing non-functionalized 1,4-BDC [42]. Moreover, pore diameter and pore volume for 2, determined by MP (Micropore analysis) method are found to be 0.6 nm and 0.454 cm3g-1, respectively."
13,Catalytic tests,"3.5 Catalytic tests The catalytic performance of the prepared Cu-based coordination polymers was studied in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol using TBHP as oxidant. All four Cu-coordination polymers exhibited good catalytic activity and displayed selectivity towards the formation of benzoic acid at 40 °C using CH2Cl2 as solvent. Different factors such as solvent, temperature, time, etc can influence catalytic oxidation of organic substrates [43,44]. Therefore, we have studies the effect of some parameters to obtain the optimal reaction conditions for benzyl alcohol oxidation in the presence of 1–3. The results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 . At first, the oxidation was investigated in CH2Cl2 at room temperature. Catalysts 1a, 2 and 3 selectively oxidized benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde while a very small amount of benzoic acid was also formed when 1b used as catalyst (Table 2, Entry 1–4). Since conversion of these reactions was 17–23%, the reaction time was extended to 8 h (Table 2, Entry 5–8) to improve the conversion. The results show that the reaction conversion for all catalysts was not significantly improved upon time extension (23–28%) although they were all still selective towards the formation of benzaldehyde. To obtain optimal reaction conditions with good conversion and selectivity, DMF is used instead of CH2Cl2. Considering polarity of the solvents, DMF with dipole moment of 3.86 D can facilitate solubility of both TBHP and benzyl alcohol compared to CH2Cl2, which has dipole moment of 1.6 D [44]. The oxidation reactions were performed in DMF for 4 h using the catalysts. The results revealed that reaction conversions were improved to 30–54% after 4 h for all catalysts and benzaldehyde and benzyl benzoate were formed as the products (Table 2, Entry 9–12). By increasing the time of the reactions to 12 h using DMF, conversions increased to 58–62% while selectivity to benzaldehyde decreased (Table 2, Entry 13–16). Since all four catalysts displayed selectivity to benzaldehyde in CH2Cl2, this solvent was selected for further study of benzyl alcohol oxidation. The reactions were conducted at 40 °C to obtain better results (Table 3). As seen, the conversion of the oxidation reaction is above 82% for 1a, 1b and 2 after 8 h. In the presence of catalyst 3, the reaction led to 97% conversion after 14 h. All catalysts in this condition afforded benzoic acid as the main product. To assess the catalytic effect of 1–3 catalysts on the oxidation process, the reaction was conducted without the catalysts under similar conditions both at room temperature and 40 °C. The results show that benzyl alcohol undergoes insubstantial oxidation to benzaldehyde (with the conversion of 11.7%) at room temperature using DMF solvent (Table 2, Entry 17). Performing the blank test at 40 °C for 14 h in CH2Cl2 also led to low conversion of 20% for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (Table 3, Entry 10). Further studies of the catalytic parameters such as oxidant and catalyst amounts as well as substrate nature were carried out and the results are given in Table 4 . By increasing the amount of oxidant from 2.26 mmol to 4.52 mmol, the reaction conversion in the presence of 1–3 reached 63–91% after 8 h (Table 4, Entries 1–4). Also, the reaction conversion of 76–88% was obtained after 6 h upon increasing of the catalyst amounts from 0.063 mmol to 0.126 mmol (Table 4, Entries 5–8). Comparing these results with the conversions reported in Table 3 shows that increasing the amounts of the catalysts led to the improvement of the reaction conversions. In order to investigate the electronic effects of substrates on the oxidation reaction, 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol and 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol were tested as representative substrate models. After 4 h, the reaction conversion of 99% was obtained using 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (Table 4, Entries 9–12). More reactivity of this substrate compared to benzyl alcohol is due to the presence of methoxy group which supply more electrons. When 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol is used as the substrate, the oxidation reaction required more time (8 h) and the selectivity towards formation of the corresponding acid decreased (Table 4, Entries 13–16). The reusability of the obtained catalysts was examined in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. After completion of the reaction, the catalysts were separated and washed with DMF. The reaction conditions were similar to those reported in Table 3 at 40 °C using CH2Cl2 as solvent. The oxidation reactions were conducted for 14 h in the presence of reused 3 and for 8 h using recycled 1a, 2 and 1b. The results, given in Fig. 9 , displayed no appreciable loss in the activity and selectivity towards benzoic acid. Copper content of the catalysts before and after the reaction was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Table 5 ). The results show negligible leaching of the catalysts. Moreover, the PXRD patterns of the fresh and recycled coordination polymers are similar (Fig. 2). These observations clearly confirm that the crystal structure of 1–3 catalysts remained intact upon the oxidation reactions, exhibiting the structural stability of the coordination polymers. In the FT-IR spectra of 1–3 which are shown in Fig. 6, the characteristic peaks for the reused catalysts resemble those found in the spectra of their corresponding pristine coordination polymers. This observation points out that the structure of the catalysts has not been changed upon oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Based on the reported literature [45], benzyl alcohol oxidation over Cu2+ catalytic sites are attributed to a free radical pathway. The Cu2+ sites react with TBHP and form peroxo (t-BuOO.) and alkoxo (t-BuO.) radical species. The peroxo radicals react with benzyl alcohol and form the corresponding alcohol radical intermediate upon abstraction of benzylic hydrogen from the substrate. The intermediate reacts with t-BuO. radical to generate t-BuOH and the oxidation products. Benzyl alcohol oxidation was reported over MOF catalysts. Ling Peng et al. investigated the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde over isostructural MOFs M(1,4-BDC)(DABCO)0.5 [M = Co, Zn, Ni, Cu] [30] with paddle wheel units. By employing Co(1,4-BDC)(DABCO)0.5 as catalyst, 81.8% conversion was obtained. Whereas in the presence of Cu(1,4-BDC)(DABCO)0.5, a very low conversion (8.8%) was achieved after 8 h. However, in our work, the Cu-based compounds with similar dinuclear units exhibited high conversions at lower temperature using less amounts of catalysts."
14,Conclusions,"This study presents four new Cu(II)-based coordination polymers with similar SBUs. Compounds 1a and 1b are formed based on a mixture of μ2-MeCO2 and linear DABCO ligands. Coordination polymers 1a and 1b are polymorphous and comprise 1-D chains with similar connectivity and different packing structures. Compound 2 which is isostructural with the reported [Zn(1,4-BDC)(DABCO)0.5], contains 1,4-BDC-Br and DABCO ligands. Compound 3 is a 2-D coordination polymer formed using 1,4-BDC-OH ligand. The resulting compounds were applied as heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. They displayed selectivity to the formation of benzoic acid at 40 °C in CH2Cl2 solvent and could be recycled and reused with maintenance of catalytic performance."
