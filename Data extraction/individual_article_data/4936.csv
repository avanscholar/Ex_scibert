0,Introduction,"Bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surface [1–4]. Our group has recently investigated the electronic and chemical properties of model bimetallic surfaces, using a combination of experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to gain insights into the effects of bimetallic formation [5–8]. For example, we have utilized the hydrogenation of cyclohexene [5,9–11], 1-hexene [12] and 1-butene [12] to demonstrate the novel low-temperature hydrogenation activities on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. In this study we use the hydrogenation of acrolein (CH2 CH−CHO) as a probe reaction on Pt(111), Ni(111) film, and Pt–Ni–Pt(111) to determine how the formation of the bimetallic surface affects the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of organic molecules containing multiple unsaturated functional groups. Studies of the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes, such as α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, have been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. Most of these studies have been carried out on supported group VIII transition metal catalysts by exploring the influence of different factors that promote the formation of the desirable unsaturated alcohols [13]. Some of those factors are: the nature of the support that influences the metal-support interaction [14,15], the electronic and steric effects of the support [16], the particle size distribution [17,18], and the impact of adding a second metal to make bimetallic alloys [19–24], among others. Comparing to monometallic surfaces, bimetallic surfaces have shown promise due to their better selectivity toward the hydrogenation of the CO bond of some α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Koel et al. have studied the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (methyl substituted acrolein at the β carbon) on Sn/Pt(111). They found that the hydrogenation activity was enhanced on the bimetallic Sn/Pt(111) surfaces in comparison with Pt(111) by using a batch reactor at relative low pressures [25]. Beccat et al. observed an enhancement on the selectivity of crotonaldehyde and methylcrotonaldehyde toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohols on Pt80Fe20(111) surfaces [26]. The enhancement in the selectivity to CO hydrogenation was attributed to alloy formation in the case of crotonaldehyde. However, the effect on the selectivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol was found to be higher by the addition of a methyl group in methylcrotonaldehyde than that induced by alloy formation. Thermal activation of crotonaldehyde using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) was performed by Zaera and de Jesus [27] on Pt(111). The main reaction pathway was decarbonylation leading to the production of CO and propene. The hydrogenation of acrolein, which is the smallest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, is an important probe reaction for the understanding of factors that govern the selectivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol. As illustrated in Scheme 1 , the hydrogenation of the CO bond of acrolein leads to the formation of the desirable unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol), while the hydrogenation of the CC bonds results in the formation of the undesirable saturated aldehyde (propanal). Both products can undergo further hydrogenation to produce the saturated alcohol (1-propanol). Single crystal studies of acrolein reaction pathways have provided insights into the adsorption mechanisms for the activation of either CC or CO bond. Studies of thermal activation of acrolein on Pt(111) [27], Rh(111) [28], and Pd(110) [29] have shown that decomposition pathways toward the formation of CO and H2 occur simultaneously with the formation of small hydrocarbon molecules, such as ethane and ethylene. The formation of both ketene and propene was also reported by Zaera and de Jesus on the Pt(111) surface [27,30]. However, on Pd(111) the formation of propanal from acrolein was reported [31]. High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) showed that at low temperature (<170K) acrolein was bound to both Rh(111) and Pd(111) in an η2(C,O) configuration, which was strongly rehybridized to an η4(C,C,C,O)-bound species upon heating the substrate to ∼200K [28,31]. The self-hydrogenation of acrolein to propanal on Pd(111) was explained in terms of a CC interaction with the substrate [31]. Recent studies have attempted to explain the absorption configurations of acrolein on different single crystals and surface alloys by using theoretical approaches and/or in combination with HREELS experiments [32–37]. Specifically, Loffreda et al. reported coverage dependence in the adsorption modes of acrolein on Pt(111) using DFT and HREELS [37]. Two configurations were found to be dominant at low coverages (up to 0.15ML) on Pt(111), a flat η4-trans and a η3-cis configuration. On the other hand, at higher coverages (0.20 and 0.25ML), η2-cis and -trans configurations through the CC bond were found to be more stable. These authors also confirmed HREEL spectra simulations of the different vibrational modes in the most stable configurations with experimental HREEL spectra at different coverages. In the current work we have focused on the high coverage region, where the η2-bonding via the CC bond of acrolein was considered to be the stable configuration. Loffreda et al. also reported that the hydrogenation of CO bond of acrolein occurs on Pt(111). However, the desorption step of the saturated aldehyde was favored over that of the unsaturated alcohol, making the net selectivity higher for the gas phase desorption of mainly the saturated aldehyde under catalytic conditions [38,39]. In a recent publication we reported the selective hydrogenation of acrolein on two types of bimetallic surfaces, Ni–Pt–Pt(111) with Ni atoms occupying the top-most surface and Pt–Ni–Pt(111) with Ni atoms occupying the subsurface region [40]. Experimental results and DFT calculations from that study indicated that the hydrogenation of acrolein by the co-adsorbed H atoms occurred on the subsurface Pt–Ni–Pt(111) structure but not on surface Ni–Pt–Pt(111) [40]. In the current study we focused on the comparison of the adsorption and hydrogenation of acrolein on Pt(111) and Ni(111) film to further demonstrate the unique hydrogenation pathways on the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) bimetallic surface. Finally, we also investigated the adsorption of the two main hydrogenation products, 2-propenol and propanal, on the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface to further understand the hydrogenation pathways of acrolein on the bimetallic surface."
1,Experimental,"Two UHV chambers were used in the current study. The TPD experiments were performed in a two-level stainless steel UHV chamber with a base pressure less than 1×10−10 Torr. This chamber is equipped with an Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for the TPD measurements. The Pt(111) single crystal (Metal Crystals and Oxides, Ltd., Cambridge), 1.5mm thick disk and 12mm in diameter, was spot welded directly to two tantalum spots that served as both electrical connections for resistive heating and thermal contacts for cooling with liquid nitrogen. Using this configuration the crystal could be cooled down to 90K and heated to 1100K. The Pt(111) surface was cleaned by cycles of sputtering with Ne+ at 600K, oxygen dosing (1×10−8 Torr) at 890K, and annealing at 1100K. The cleanliness of the surface was checked by AES measurements. The Pt(111) surface was heated at a rate of 3K/s during the TPD experiments, with the surface placed at a distance of ∼5mm from the opening of a random flux shield of the mass spectrometer. The TPD setup was used to monitor up to 10 masses simultaneously. The HREELS experiments were performed in a three-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure 6×10−10 Torr) equipped with a QMS, LEED, AES, and an LK-3000 double-pass HREEL spectrometer for vibrational analysis. The HREEL spectra reported here were acquired with a primary beam energy of 6eV. Angles of incidence and reflection were 60° with respect to the surface normal in the specular direction. For some measurements the reflection angle was moved to 50° with respect to the surface normal in an off-specular direction. Count rates in the elastic peak were typically 3×104–3×105 counts per second (cps), and the spectral resolution was between 30 and 40cm−1 full-width at half maximum (FWHM). The exposure of acrolein or hydrogen was made with the Pt(111) surface held at <120K. The initial HREEL spectrum was acquired at low temperature (∼110K). The adsorbed layer was then heated to a specified temperature with a linear rate of 3K/s, held for 5s, then cooled down to ∼110K for data collection. The temperatures were chosen on the basis of the TPD results. Acrolein (Alfa Aesar, 99.9% stabilized with hydroquinone 0.1%) was purified by successive freeze–pump–thaw cycles prior to use. The purity was verified in situ by mass spectrometry. Hydrogen, oxygen, and neon were all research grade purity (Matheson, 99.999%) and were introduced into the UHV chamber without further purification. Doses are reported in Langmuirs (1 Langmuir (L)=1×10−6 Torrs) and are not corrected for ion gauge sensitivity factors. Acrolein, 2-propenol, propanal, and oxygen were dosed through directional dosing tubes, with a diameter of ∼5mm, attached to leak valves with a crystal temperature below 120K. For H2 dosing, the exposure of 0.5L in the TPD chamber (directional dosing) and 5L in the HREELS chamber (background dosing) resulted in ∼50% saturation coverage of hydrogen, based on TPD measurements as a function of hydrogen exposure. The bimetallic surfaces were prepared by physical vapor deposition (PVD) of Ni on the Pt(111) surface by maintaining the crystal at 600K to prevent CO adsorption from the background, as described in detail previously [6]. The evaporative Ni doser consisted of a Ni wire (99.999% purity) wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire, which was contained in a stainless steel enclosure with an opening of ∼1cm in diameter. During deposition, the UHV pressure remained below 5×10−10 Torr. The metal coverage was estimated using AES by monitoring the Ni(849eV)/Pt(241eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio. Up to a monolayer coverage, when the Pt(111) substrate is maintained at a temperature of 600K, Ni atoms diffuse to the subsurface of Pt(111), resulting in a top layer enriched with Pt atoms [6]. The surface prepared at 600K at a monolayer coverage is referred to as a Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface in the current paper. The Ni(849eV)/Pt(241eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio corresponding to this surface is ∼1. The Pt–Ni–Pt(111) subsurface structure was previously characterized using a combination of low energy ion scattering (LEIS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and DFT modeling [6]. The LEIS results indicate that the most of the surface Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region after heating a ML Ni/Pt(111) surface to 600K. Although there is no direct experimental confirmation of Ni residing exclusively in the second layer, the following indirect evidence strongly suggests the presence of the subsurface Ni atoms: (1) DFT modeling indicates that the d-band center of Pt is modified by the presence of Ni directly underneath Pt in the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) structure, and trends in the calculated binding energies of various adsorbates have been confirmed experimentally [6]. (2) DFT modeling suggests that the second layer Ni should segregate to the top-most surface in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, which has been confirmed experimentally [41]. (3) The novel chemistry of the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) subsurface structure is always observed by annealing the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface to 600–700K. If the annealing temperature is above 800K, at which temperature the Ni starts to diffuse into the bulk of Pt(111) based on AES measurements, the surface essentially behaves as Pt(111) and the Ni atoms no longer segregate to the surface after exposing to oxygen. As discussed earlier, at Ni coverages greater than a monolayer, Ni layers start to resemble a Ni(111) surface on top of the Pt(111) substrate [5,42]. It is important to point out the presence of the lattice mismatch due to the different bond lengths between Ni and Pt, which are 2.49Å and 2.77Å, respectively. As a result, the first Ni overlayer on top of the Pt(111) substrate is under a tensile strain. The (1×1) LEED pattern becomes sharper after a Ni film with a Ni(849eV)/Pt(241eV) AES ratio higher than 6. Using H2 and C2H4 TPD as probe reactions, we observed that such Ni(111) film was similar to that of a Ni(111) single crystal surface [8]. Therefore, the surface with a Ni(849eV)/Pt(241eV) AES ratio higher than 6 is referred to as a Ni(111) film in the current manuscript."
2,Results and discussion,
3,TPD results,"3.1 TPD results 3.1.1 Reaction pathways of acrolein The gas-phase products of acrolein were studied using TPD by monitoring the mass cracking patterns that belong to the different decomposition and hydrogenation products. Some of the fragmentation patterns of acrolein, propanal, 2-propenol and 1-propanol overlap as reported in NIST database [43]. The TPD traces reported here were chosen based on the main contributions to the mass spectrum of the compound of interest. Other masses were also collected to confirm the desorption of the main products in the TPD spectra. The TPD spectra of 31, 58, and 60amu are shown in Fig. 1 for different Ni coverages after dosing 0.5L of acrolein at 100K. The 31amu trace is related mainly to 2-propenol (hydrogenation of CO), the 58 amu trace is primarily related to propanal (hydrogenation of CC), and the 60amu TPD spectrum is associated with 1-propanol (hydrogenation of both CO and CC). The spectra of molecular desorption of acrolein (56amu), hydrogen (2amu), and CO and ethylene (28amu) are also shown in Fig. 1. Four different Ni/Pt(111) surfaces were included in Fig. 1. The TPD spectra of these masses from clean Pt(111) are also included for comparison. As mentioned earlier, when Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600K, Ni atoms diffuse to the subsurface of Pt(111) at submonolayer and monolayer coverages. These surfaces are referred to as subsurface Ni structures, 0.5ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) and 1ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111). For coverages higher than one monolayer, Ni atoms start to form a Ni(111) film on top of the Pt(111) surface, which are referred to as ∼2ML Ni/Pt(111) and Ni(111) film in Fig. 1 [5,42]. On the clean Pt(111) surface (Fig. 1), no hydrogenation products are detected, which is in agreement with previous studies reported by Zaera and de Jesus [27,30]. Based on the 56amu TPD spectrum, acrolein desorbs from Pt(111) as a sharp peak centered around 143K with smaller multilayer peaks at ∼129 and 114K. The peak at 114K appears to be more intense while the peak at 129K is not noticeable from the 0.5ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface. The 1ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface exhibits the same peaks with higher intensities, which could be related with the decrease of the decomposition pathway as will be discussed later. At higher Ni coverages a single peak centered at 135K is observed for the desorption of molecular acrolein. The intensity of this peak is slightly higher from the thick Ni(111) film. The desorption of 2-propenol (31amu) shows practically no features on Pt(111). It starts to occur on the 0.5ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface as a weak peak at 271K. The desorption peak on the 1ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface occurs at 265K. The desorption of 2-propenol occurs at 253K from the ∼2ML Ni/Pt(111) surface and at 351K from the thick Ni(111) film. The desorption of propanal (58amu) starts to occur as a weak peak at 271K from the 0.5ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface, with the intensity reaching maximum at a slightly lower temperature from the 1ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface (265K). The desorption temperature of propanal from the ∼2ML Ni/Pt(111) and thick Ni(111) film occurs in the same temperature ranges as for 2-propenol. Finally, gas-phase 1-propanol (60amu) is not detected from any surface. Therefore, the consecutive self-hydrogenation of both CC and CO bonds does not occur on Pt(111), Pt–Ni–Pt(111) or Ni(111) film. Hydrogen (2amu) desorbs from clean Pt(111) in two peaks at 277 and 490K, with the latter showing a shoulder at ∼445K. On the 0.5ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface, the low temperature desorption peak is still present but the high temperature peak occurs at 445K. The desorption of the hydrogen product decreases on the 1ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface, as characterized by a low intensity peak at 277K and a broad peak centered at 402K. As more Ni is deposited on the Pt(111) surface, a relative intense peak is observed at 364K from the ∼2ML Ni/Pt(111) surface and the thick Ni(111) film, with the latter also showing a smaller peak at 297K. Lastly, the 28amu spectra include the desorption of both CO due to decarbonylation and the hydrogenated products through their cracking pattern. CO desorbs from clean Pt(111) surface at 385K. Smaller peaks at 250 and 303K correspond to the cracking pattern of ethylene and ketene in agreement with previous studies [27]. The desorption of CO decreases on the 0.5ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) and 1 ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surfaces with peaks at 331 and 321K, respectively. Again cracking patterns most likely due to ethylene and hydrogenated products occur at 223 and 271K, respectively, on the 0.5ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface. These peaks are slightly shifted to lower temperatures on the 1ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface. An increase in the decarbonylation pathway is confirmed on higher Ni coverages, as indicated by the desorption of CO from the ∼2ML Ni/Pt(111) surface at 364K with a shoulder at 331K, which becomes even more intense from the Ni(111) film at 364K with a shoulder at 408K. The activity toward the different hydrogenation and decomposition products is estimated based on the TPD peaks that contribute to the cracking patterns of each gas-phase reaction product. The gas-phase mass spectra of the potential products and acrolein were collected by introducing them into the UHV chamber at similar pressures (∼1.1×10−8 Torr). Based on these spectra and the measurements of the TPD peak areas for 2-propenol, propanal, 1-propanol, ethylene, CO and hydrogen, the yields of these products from the different surfaces, expressed in units of molecule per surface metal atom, are calculated and are shown in Table 1 . The empirical procedure developed by Ko et al. [44] is used for the correction of mass spectrometer sensitivity in the calculations. The calibration of CO coverages from the decarbonylation of acrolein is estimated by TPD following the saturation exposure of CO on clean Pt(111) [45]. The CO TPD peak areas are calibrated by assuming the saturation coverage of CO on Pt(111) to be 0.68ML [45]. The integrated area of CO desorption spectrum is used as base to calculate absolute yields of the desorbing products, with the yields of all other carbon-containing gas-phase products being calculated once they are deconvoluted (if needed) and corrected by their sensitivity factors relative to CO. The absolute yields of Cads and H2 were estimated based on the formation of CO and using atomic balance based on the following equations: (1) CH 2 = CH - CH = O → CH 2 = CH 2 + CO (2) CH 2 = CH - CH = O → 2 H 2 + 2 C ads + CO The stoichiometry in Eq. (1) leads to a molecular ratio of ethylene/CO of one, while in the decomposition pathway (Eq. (2)) for every molecule of CO formed there are two H2 molecules and two Cads atoms on the surface. For the Ni(111) film, the self-hydrogenation yield to propanal is 0.014 molecule per surface metal atom, significantly lower than that on the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface. In contrast, self-hydrogenation of acrolein does not occur on Pt(111), which is consistent with previous studies by Zaera and de Jesus [27,30]. As summarized in Table 1, on Pt(111) the main decomposition products are CO, C2H4, H2 and Cads. In addition, the formation of ketene and propene are also detected when following the TPD spectra of 14, 39 and 42amu (not shown), which is again consistent with the results by Zaera and de Jesus [27,30]. Due to the lack of sensitivity factors for ketene and propene, their yields are not quantified on the Pt(111) surface in the current study. Ketene is also detected on the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface, with the TPD peak area being ∼75% of that from Pt(111). Gas-phase ketene is not detected from the Ni(111) film. 3.1.2 Effect of pre-adsorption of hydrogen The effect of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the hydrogenation of acrolein on Pt(111), Pt–Ni–Pt(111), and Ni(111) film was studied. For these experiments, 0.5L of hydrogen (∼50% saturation) was dosed at <140K prior to exposure to 0.5L of acrolein and the results are displayed in Fig. 2 . The clean Pt(111) surface does not exhibit hydrogenation, in the presence of pre-dosed hydrogen, except trace amount of propanal as reported elsewhere [40]. The most noticeable change is the enhancement of the hydrogen TPD peaks (not shown). The presence of surface hydrogen induces two intense low-temperature desorption peaks of molecular acrolein on the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface at 126 and 138K, as shown in Fig. 2. In addition, the desorption of 2-propenol (31amu) and propanal (58amu) increases at 260K. The formation of 1-propanol (60amu) is also observed as a relative weak peak at ∼256K. The desorption of acrolein on the Ni(111) film with pre-adsorbed hydrogen occurs as a broader peak centered at 135K. Propanal desorbs at a lower temperature (216K) when pre-adsorbed hydrogen is present on the Ni(111) film. Mass 60amu is not detected on the thick Ni(111) film. Hydrogen desorption increases slightly from the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface. On the Ni(111) film, the main hydrogen desorption temperature is shifted to 330K with a shoulder at ∼300K, with a smaller peak at 381K. The CO desorption (28amu) state increases slightly in the presence of pre-dosed hydrogen on the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface. On the Ni(111) film the desorption temperature of CO increases to 418K but the peak intensity is lower in the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen. In contrast, the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen does not significantly affect the hydrogenation activity or selectivity on the Ni(111) film, as shown in Table 1. This can be explained by the strong bonding of acrolein and its intermediates on Ni(111), resulting in the complete decomposition to produce CO and Cads as the dominant reaction pathway (Table 1). Last, the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on Ni(111) reduces the number of sites for acrolein adsorption, leading to reduced yields of CO and Cads as shown in Table 1."
4,HREELS results,"3.2 HREELS results 3.2.1 Vibrational spectra of acrolein, 2-propenol and propanal HREELS measurements are performed to identify the surface intermediates after the adsorption and thermal decomposition of acrolein on clean Pt(111), Pt–Ni–Pt(111), and the Ni(111) film. The vibrational spectra of acrolein adsorbed on Pt(111) at different exposures are shown in Fig. 3 . The vibrational assignment based on calculated features from DFT [37] is shown in Table 2 for acrolein adsorbed on different surfaces. In the top spectrum in Fig. 3, most of the vibrational features remain unperturbed in comparison with the calculated ones, which is expected at a multilayer exposure of 5L at ∼110K. At lower exposures, some vibrational features are different from the calculated values. For example, the ν(CO) mode (1698cm−1) is not well resolved at either 0.5 or 1L exposure of acrolein, suggesting that the interaction of the CO bond with Pt(111) occurs at low coverages. The slight red shift, observed for the ν(CO) mode (1691–1664cm−1) at low coverages, suggests the interaction of the carbonyl group with the surface, as observed previously on Rh(111) and Pd(111) [28,31]. In order to identify whether the hydrogenation products are produced as surface intermediates on the bimetallic surface, HREEL spectra of 2-propenol and propanal were measured on the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface at exposures slightly below the monolayer coverage at ∼110K, as shown in Fig. 4 . The vibrational frequencies are compared to those of gas-phase 2-propenol and liquid-phase propanal in Tables 3 and 4 , respectively. The spectrum of 2-propenol shows similar features to those in the gas-phase [28,46]. Some of the characteristic features of adsorbed 2-propenol on Pt–Ni–Pt(111) include the ν(CC) mode at 1637cm−1, the ν(CH2) feature at 3071cm−1 and the broad ν(O–H) mode at ∼3300cm−1. In comparison, the characteristic features for adsorbed propanal include the relatively sharp δ(CH3) mode at 1373cm−1 and the ν(CO) mode at 1664cm−1 [47,48]. The main purpose of Fig. 4 in the current study is to provide reference spectra to help identify whether the two hydrogenation products are produced on the surface during the hydrogenation of acrolein. More detailed TPD and HREELS studies of the reaction pathways of 2-propenol, propanal and 1-propanol on Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces will be published elsewhere. 3.2.2 Reaction of acrolein on Pt(111), Pt–Ni–Pt(111), and Ni(111) film The HREEL spectra following the thermal decomposition of acrolein on Pt(111) are shown in Fig. 5 . The ∼110K spectrum of 0.3L of acrolein, which is near monolayer coverage based on TPD measurements in the HREELS chamber, exhibits features that show the retention of the CC bond, as indicated by the presence of the ν(CH2) mode at 3098cm−1 and the ν(CC) feature at ∼1630cm−1 (see Table 2). The retention of the CO bond is demonstrated by the observation of the ν(CO) mode at 1664cm−1 as well as the δ(CCO) feature at 548cm−1. Upon heating to 200K, the ν(CC) and ν(CO) modes are observed at 1616 and 1680cm−1, respectively. The δ(CCO) mode appears at 561cm−1, and the modes around 3000cm−1 are still present. However, the vibrational features at 3098, 994, and 602cm−1 are no longer present. The Pt–C vibrational modes at 426 and 473cm−1 become more intense and better defined, in agreement with that observed by Loffreda et al. for exposures of acrolein at around 180K on Pt(111) [37]. The decarbonylation of acrolein occurs upon heating to 300K, as indicated by the onset of the 1826 and 2070cm−1 features for CO adsorbed on the bridge and on-top sites, respectively. The presence of the relatively sharp feature at 1691cm−1 is likely related to the formation of ketene that starts to desorb at around 285K with a peak centered at 304K (TPD spectrum of 14amu, not shown), which is in agreement with the observation by de Jesus and Zaera [27]. The formation of a decarbonylated intermediate is also indicated by the single broad band centered at 2963cm−1, corresponding to the ν(CH3) mode in ethylidyne. The presence of the ethylidyne intermediate is also consistent with the detection of the relatively sharp ρ(CH3), ν(C–C), and δ(CH3) bands at 980, 1123, and 1353cm−1, respectively. The spectrum upon heating to 400K still shows features related to the ethylidyne species at 981, 1123, 1339, and 2949cm−1. The observation of peaks at 1407 and 2895cm−1 suggests the presence of acetylide moieties, which are also observed on Rh(111) from the decomposition of acrolein [28]. Fig. 6 shows the HREEL spectra following the thermal decomposition of acrolein on the 1ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface. The spectrum of acrolein at 110K shows similar frequencies to those on clean Pt(111). Several changes are observed upon annealing the surface to 200K: (1) the presence of the on-top ν(CO) mode at 2036cm−1 suggests that decarbonylation of adsorbed acrolein starts to occur at this temperature; (2) the relative intensities of the acrolein vibrational features are different from those at 110K, with many features undergoing a change in frequency in the range of ±30cm−1; (3) the ν(CH2) mode at 3078cm−1 and the CH2 twist mode at 608cm−1 disappear, suggesting a strong interaction between the CC moiety of acrolein with the surface; (4) the presence of the ν(CO) mode at 1644cm−1 and the relatively sharp δ(CCO) at 534cm−1 suggests that the skeletal aldehyde structure remains on the surface; and (5) a relatively intense and broad new feature is observed at 846cm−1. As shown earlier in the TPD results (Fig. 1), the desorption of the self-hydrogenation products (2-propenol and propanal) and relatively small amounts of H2 and CO occur between 200 and 300K from the ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface. In the corresponding HREELS measurements, the broad and intense feature at 846cm−1 disappears upon heating to 300K. At present we do not know the origin of the 846cm−1 feature, although it is clearly related to intermediate(s) that lead to the self-hydrogenation of acrolein between 200 and 300K. The vibrational spectrum at 300K appears to be in general similar to the reference spectrum of propanal in Fig. 4. The main exception is that the δ(COO) feature of propanal at 663cm−1 is absent, suggesting that the interaction between the surface and the COO moiety of the propanal-like intermediate is different from that of molecularly adsorbed propanal. The detection of a propanal-like vibrational features can be attributed to the presence of either the di-σ bonded acrolein through the CC moiety or the remaining propanal intermediate (via self-hydrogenation of acrolein) that does not desorb from the surface. In addition, the ν(CO) mode at 2036cm−1 increases in intensity, indicating the additional decarbonylation at 300K. Most of the propanal-like features disappear after annealing to 400K, with the remaining features being assigned to adsorbed CO at 2036cm−1 and CH x fragments with γ(C–H) at 778cm−1, δ(CH x ) at 1407cm−1, and ν(CH x ) at 2976cm−1. The HREEL spectra following the thermal decomposition of acrolein on the Ni(111) film, shown in Fig. 7 , are in general similar to those on Pt–Ni–Pt(111) at the corresponding annealing temperatures. One noticeable difference is that the CO product occupies both the bridge and on-top sites, with the vibrational frequency at 1786 and 2022cm−1, respectively, after annealing to 300K. In addition, the vibrational features on the Ni(111) film appear to be better resolved than on Pt–Ni–Pt(111), especially in the 300K spectrum. For example, the ν(CH) region is clearly resolved into two features at 2916 and 2963cm−1 on the Ni(111) film. The sharper vibrational features suggest that the propanal-like intermediate is better ordered on the Ni(111) film at 300K. 3.2.3 HREEL spectra with pre-adsorbed hydrogen Even though 2-propenol is detected in the TPD measurements from the self-hydrogenation of acrolein from the ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface, the characteristic 2-propenol features, such as ν(CH2) at 3071cm−1 and ν(O–H) at ∼3300cm−1 (Fig. 4), are not detected in the HREELS measurements (Fig. 6). The TPD results indicate that the production of 2-propenol is significantly enhanced after the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface is pre-dosed with hydrogen (Fig. 2). We have performed HREELS studies to determine weather the pre-adsorbed hydrogen leads to the formation of the 2-propenol surface intermediate. We have carried out both on- and off-specular HREELS measurements in case the O–H bond of the 2-propenol intermediate is parallel to the surface and therefore dipole-forbidden in the specular HREELS measurements. Fig. 8 shows the specular and off-specular HREEL spectra of acrolein adsorbed on Pt–Ni–Pt(111) in the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen at ∼110K and after annealing to 200K. At ∼110K, the vibrational features are similar to those of acrolein on clean Pt–Ni–Pt(111) (Fig. 6), with one difference being that there is a clear splitting of the ν(CC) and ν(CO) modes at 1610 and 1684cm−1, respectively. However, after annealing to 200K several significant differences are observed with and without pre-adsorbed hydrogen: (1) Comparing to clean Pt–Ni–Pt(111) that shows a ν(CC)/ν(CO) mode at 1644cm−1, the vibrational feature in Fig. 8 appears at 1569cm−1, which is too low in frequency to be the ν(CO) mode and suggests the bonding between the CO moiety and the H/Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface. (2) The intensity of the 1218cm−1 (CH(β) ip-bend) mode, relative to other CH x features, is more intense on the H/Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface, suggesting that the CC moiety does not interact as strongly as that on clean Pt–Ni–Pt(111). (3) In the specular spectrum, the intensity of the 846cm−1 feature, which is related to the production of the hydrogenation product as described earlier in Fig. 6, shows a higher relatively intensity as compared to that on clean Pt–Ni–Pt(111). Furthermore, the comparison of the 200K specular and off-specular spectra reveals that several modes, such as δ(CCO) at 534cm−1, (CH(β) ip-bend) at 1218cm−1, and ν(CC) at 1569cm−1, have strong dipole characters as indicated by the decrease in intensity in the off-specular spectrum as compared to other vibrational features. More importantly, neither specular nor off-specular spectra show the characteristic ν(CH2) mode at 3071cm−1 and ν(O–H) mode at ∼3300cm−1, indicating that 2-propenol is not produced as surface intermediate at 200K."
5,Unique hydrogenation activity and selectivity of Pt–Ni–Pt(111),"3.3 Unique hydrogenation activity and selectivity of Pt–Ni–Pt(111) As summarized in Table 1, the saturated aldehyde (propanal) is the main self-hydrogenation product on the 1ML Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface, with an activity of 0.09 propanal per surface Pt atom. The hydrogenation selectivity, defined as the ratio between the yield of a hydrogenation compound and the total yield of hydrogenation compounds, is ∼98%, which is in agreement with the thermodynamic preference for the hydrogenation of the CC bond in the α,β-unsaturated aldehydes [49]. DFT calculations have shown that the presence of Ni atoms on the second layer of a Pt(111) surface shifts the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center) away from the Fermi level as compared to either Pt(111) or Ni(111) [7]. This electronic modification leads to a weaker binding energy for hydrogen and alkenes on the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface, which has been suggested to be responsible for the low temperature self-hydrogenation activity of the CC bond in 1-hexene and cyclohexene on the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface [5,6]. Accordingly, similar argument can be made in the current study for the self-hydrogenation activity of acrolein on Pt–Ni–Pt(111). A weaker interaction of the acrolein moieties with the bimetallic surface is likely to promote the self-hydrogenation of the CC bond in acrolein to produce propanal. On the other hand, the consecutive hydrogenation to the saturated alcohol does not occur. This could be explained by the non-steady process of the TPD experiments and the preferential hydrogenation of the CC bond [26]. Pre-adsorbed hydrogen enhances the hydrogenation selectivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) on the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface. As summarized in Table 1, on this surface the yield to 2-propenol increases by a factor of 12.5 (from 0.002 to 0.025 molecule per Pt atom), while the yield to propanal increases only by 0.3 (from 0.09 to 0.12 molecule per Pt atom). The preferential enhancement in 2-propenol production is explained in our previous publication of the DFT modeling of binding energies of acrolein on Pt–Ni–Pt(111) with co-adsorbed hydrogen [40]. In that study the binding energies of acrolein were calculated in three different geometries (di-σ-C–C, di-σ-C–O and flat η4). Table 5 compares the binding energies of the three bonding configurations with and without co-adsorbed hydrogen. On clean Pt–Ni–Pt(111), the di-σ-C–C and flat η4 configurations are preferred over di-σ-C–O, leading to the preferential hydrogenation of the CC bond to produce propanal as the main hydrogenation product. In comparison, on the H/Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface, the difference between the binding energies of the three geometries is much smaller, making it possible for the surface to effectively interact with the CO moiety, which should facilitate the production of 2-propenol. The interaction of the CO moiety with the H/Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface confirmed in the HREELS measurements, as indicated by the absence of the ν(CO) mode at 200K in Fig. 8."
6,Conclusions,"Using TPD and HREELS, the reaction pathways of acrolein are compared on Pt(111), Ni(111) film, and bimetallic Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surfaces. Based on the results and the discussion presented above, the following conclusions can be made regarding the reaction mechanisms of acrolein on these surfaces: The formation of a bimetallic Pt–Ni–Pt(111) subsurface structure promotes the production of gas-phase hydrogenation products, with saturated aldehyde, propanal, being observed from all the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. The Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface also leads to the self-hydrogenation of acrolein toward the desirable unsaturated alcohol, 2-propenol, as a minor product. Vibrational studies using HREELS show features consistent with the hydrogenation product, propanal, on the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) and Ni(111) film surfaces, which is not present on the Pt(111) surface. The presence of pre-adsorbed atomic hydrogen on Pt–Ni–Pt(111) significantly increases the hydrogenation yield to 2-propenol in the TPD measurements. The HREELS and previous DFT modeling results indicate that the increase is due to the enhanced interaction of the CO moiety with the surface, facilitating the hydrogenation of the CO bond to produce 2-propenol."
