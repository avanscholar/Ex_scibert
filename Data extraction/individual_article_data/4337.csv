0,Introduction,"Oxidation of alcohols to corresponding aldehydes has been widely concerned and researched. As a typical oxidation product of alcohol, benzaldehyde (BzH) is extensively used as a raw material in cosmetics, perfumery, food, and pharmaceutical industries. 1–3 Commercially, it is produced from hydrolysis of benzal chloride or oxidation of toluene in liquid phase. 4,5 However, traces amount of chlorine may be introduced in product for the former route and poor selectivity of BzH for the latter process. Currently, liquid phase oxidation of BzOH to BzH is a preferred synthetic route for it is eco-friendly and economically efficient. 6,7 Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been widely applied for oxidizing organic substrates due to its clean and environmentally friendly nature. Oxidation of BzOH by hydrogen peroxide or molecular oxygen in aqueous phase has been reported in combination with recyclable catalysts. 8–11 Some metal-catalyzed alcohol oxidations involve the use of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, e.g., organometallic complexes, 12,13 metal nanoparticles, 14,15 and supported Pd, 16 have been employed. In addition, Iron-chloride immobilized ionic liquid (SIL-FeCl3) as a green heterogeneous catalyst was also used to prepare BzH from BzOH with excellent catalytic activity. 17 However, most reported catalytic oxidation systems demonstrated some intrinsic drawbacks, including use of organic solvents, low selectivity due to over-oxidation of BzH, mass transfer limitation, environmental pollution, high cost, and difficulty to recover. From the viewpoint of economy and sustainable chemistry, developing a cheap and metal-free catalyst with high selectivity may be a better alternative to noble metal for the oxidation of BzOH. Over the past few decades, supramolecular reactivity has attracted tremendous interests. 18,19 As one of supramolecular hosts, cyclodextrins (CDs) have been introduced into the water-phase catalytic systems including oxidation, reduction, ring opening and hydrolysis etc. 20–23 CDs are cyclic oligosaccharides composed of 6–8 glucopyranose units (namely α-, β- and γ-CDs) linked by glycosidic bonds. 24,25 They have a torus structure with a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic internal cavity. One of the striking features of CDs is that they can form inclusion complexes with different guest molecules in aqueous solution through host-guest interactions. They have also been employed as catalysts for chemical reactions. 26,27 On the basis of economic criteria, ease of separation and recyclable utilization of the catalysts, the immobilization of CDs on solid supports is highly desirable. Immobilized CDs have gathered much attention in organic synthesis because they possessed some advantages such as high catalytic activity and easy recycling for the catalytic reaction compared with free CDs. They have been successfully introduced to catalyze some reactions. 28–31 With increasing concerns on environmental safety, the use of renewable sources and reduction of waste has attracted great concern worldwide. Lignin is the second most abundant natural resources after cellulose, and the major phenolic aromatic polymers in nature. 32 The global production of lignin is more than 50 million tons per year, and about 95% of the output was disposed as a main by-product from pulp and paper industry due to its complex irregular macromolecular properties. 33 However, lignin is rich in hydroxyl groups arising from phenolic hydroxyl and carboxylic groups, and its graft polymerization with some monomers has been an effective way to introduce functional groups to improve its properties. 34,35 Recently, a series of catalytic systems based on the synergistic effects between catalyst and support have been reported for the oxidation of substrates extensively. 29,31 Among CDs, β-CD is generally the most useful due to its appropriately sized cavity, accessibility, and lowest cost. In addition, β-CD contains a hydrophobic central cavity, which can form inclusion complexes with different guest molecules by noncovalent bonding in aqueous solution. It can be used to selectively catalyze chemical reactions by the weak interactions, which is extremely similar to the exact molecular recognition of an enzyme to a substrate. 29 In the present paper, β-CD grafted on lignin crosslinked by EPI as crosslinking agent (l-β-CD) was first prepared and used as a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the oxidation of BzOH to BzH under mild reaction conditions. The obtained catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity for solution selective oxidation of BzOH and its structure was systematically characterized by various physico-chemical techniques. In additional, a rational mechanism of the oxidation was proposed."
1,Results and discussion,
2,FTIR analysis,"2.1 FTIR analysis FTIR spectra of lignin (a), LE (b), β-CD (c), and l-β-CD (d) are presented in Fig. 1 . The FTIR spectrum of lignin displays the peaks ascribed to the O–H stretching vibrations (around 3440 cm−1), C–H stretching of –CH3, –CH2 groups (around 2950–2835 cm−1), CO stretching vibrations of ketone group (around 1700–1560 cm−1), and the peaks at 1590, 1514, and 1410 cm−1 assigned to the stretching vibrations of the C–C bonds in the aromatic skeleton. Peaks at 1375, 1265, and 1220 cm−1 due to the stretching vibrations of C–O are also observed. These results are in agreement with previously reported data. 37 The characteristic bands associated with the presence of specific functional groups of β-CD have been identified and described in the previous publications. 38,39 The FTIR spectrum of l-β-CD is similar to those of lignin and β-CD, indicating that their frameworks are not changed. The peaks of l-β-CD at 3440 and 1030 cm−1 are stronger than those of β-CD. The increased intensity may be attributed to the presence of more –OH and C–O–C groups in l-β-CD. The peak at 916 cm−1 due to the epoxy ring of LE is completely disappeared (Fig. 1b), indicating the complete consumption of the epoxy groups due to the polymerization reaction. 40 The band at 837 cm−1 due to C–H in-plane deformations in aromatic rings is observed for both l-β-CD and lignin, which shows the aromatic nature of the samples. 41 Thus, it can be concluded from the FTIR spectra that β-CD has been grafted on the surface of lignin successfully."
3,TG analysis,"2.2 TG analysis TG curves of lignin (a), LE (b), and l-β-CD (c) were shown in Fig. 2 . Two weight losses were observed for lignin in the TG curve (Fig. 2a). The first weight loss was about 2.3% from 30 to 150 °C, which was caused by dehydration. The second stage started at about 200 °C with weight loss of 40.5% due to heat decomposition of lignin. For the TG curve of LE, the weight loss of about 6.3% before 150 °C was due to evaporation of water in the sample, and the second weight loss of about 49.6% was attributed to the thermal cleavage of LE (Fig. 2b). As for l-β-CD, the weight loss before 150 °C was about 5.1% due to the evaporation of the adsorbed water on the surface of l-β-CD and the included water in the cavity of β-CD. In the range of 150–550 °C, the second weight loss of l-β-CD was about 49.6% (Fig. 2c). Thus, the amount of β-CD grafted on the surface of lignin is about 6% (m/m). In addition, the second degradation stage of lignin exhibited a higher temperature (250 °C) than that of l-β-CD (200 °C), indicating that the modified lignin is less stable than lignin due to the weak cross-linkage."
4,SEM analysis,"2.3 SEM analysis Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the structural aspects of β-CD, lignin, and l-β-CD. The results were shown in Fig. 3 . From SEM analysis, lignin was found as amorphous plates/particles with some agglomeration (Fig. 3b). β-CD consisted of large crystalline particles of rather irregular size (Fig. 3a), whereas l-β-CD was amorphous spherical particles, indicating β-CD was grafted on the surface of lignin (Fig. 3c). Its porous structure with pore diameter about 200 nm might be due to crosslink formation between lignin and β-CD. The morphology images demonstrated that the amorphous lignin plates were converted to porous structure after modification, leading to increase of β-CD content on the surface of lignin and might be beneficial for the inclusion and reaction of BzOH."
5,Solid state CP/MAS 13C NMR analysis,"2.4 Solid state CP/MAS 13C NMR analysis Solid state 13C NMR spectroscopy is a very efficient tool for the analysis of structure of the insoluble polymers. 42 CP/MAS 13C NMR of β-CD (a), lignin (b), and l-β-CD (c) were shown in Fig. 4 . From Fig. 4a, 13C NMR spectrum of β-CD displayed well resolved signals. 13C signals at 105.5 (C1), 79.6 (C4), 77.5 (C5), 73.0 (C3), 62.9 (C6), and 59.2 (C2) ppm were attributed to the glucopyranose unit of β-CD. The signals at 152.6, 147.5, 133.2, 121.6, 114.2, and 55.3 ppm represented C3,5 (etherified), C3,5 (non-etherified), C1/C4 (nonetherified), C6, C5, and –OCH3 in lignin. 43 The resonances arising from l-β-CD were broad and featureless, indicating that the crystalline nature of β-CD was lost. The decrease of the C-1signals of β-CD and the increase of the signals in the region between 60 and 70 ppm could be attributed to the hydroxymethyl group at C-6 in the glucose unit of β-CD. In addition, a new signal at 62.5 ppm was due to the hydroxymethyl group of the EPI terminal residue, which was in agreement with the previous results. 42 l-β-CD was quite similar to lignin in the solid state, and most of the lignin signals in Fig. 4c could be directly assigned to lignin. Moreover, some peaks were observed in the 50–150 ppm region, indicating its structure characteristics. 44 The results clearly demonstrated that β-CD was grafted on the surface of lignin by EPI."
6,Catalytic activity studies,"2.5 Catalytic activity studies The catalytic oxidation of BzOH to BzH was carried out using l-β-CD as the phase-transfer catalyst and sodium bicarbonate as the cocatalyst. Under certain reaction conditions, the results indicated that only BzH was produced from the oxidation of BzOH catalyzed by phase-transfer catalysis and cocatalyst in this work and no by-products were observed during the reaction. Therefore, the conversion rate of BzOH was equal to the production rate of BzH. (1) − d [ C 7 H 8 O ] d t = d [ C 7 H 6 O ] d t (2) − ln ( 1 − X ) = K app × t where X is the conversion of BzOH, and K app is the apparent rate constant of the reaction. K app is obtained by plotting −ln (1−X) versus t. 2.5.1 Catalytic activity of various catalysts Generally speaking, it is difficult to oxidize organic substrates with aqueous H2O2 because they are mutually insoluble. Therefore, it is necessary to study the role of oxidant, phase-transfer catalyst, and cocatalysts to promote the reaction. In this study, NaHCO3 was used as the cocatalyst. The results were shown in Fig. 5 . From Fig. 5, the catalytic activity is significantly affected by any one of the components. No BzOH was converted to BzH only in the presence of NaHCO3 and 4.8% of BzH was produced with aqueous H2O2 as oxidant, and the addition of NaHCO3 could improve the conversion of BzOH to 12.4%. BzH (38.9%) was given with β-CD as the phase-transfer catalyst, but the addition of lignin could not enhance the catalytic performance even at a reaction time of 48 h. High conversion of BzOH (58.4%) was obtained in the presence of l-β-CD, H2O2, and NaHCO3 after reaction for 4 h. The above results indicated that synergistic effects between β-CD and the functional groups of lignin could play an important role in the enhancement of BzOH oxidation. l-β-CD displayed much better activity and selectivity than those of β-CD and lignin, demonstrating that the support associated with β-CD has a significant positive influence for the reaction system. It might be attributed that the synergistic effects based on the intermolecular weak interactions, e.g., hydrogen bond between β-CD and the functional groups of lignin can enhance substrate specificity. The result has been confirmed by experimental and theoretical study in the previously reported reference. 31 2.5.2 Effect of stirring speed The effect of stirring speed on the conversion rate of BzOH was investigated in the range of 0–500 rpm, as shown in Fig. 6. From the plots of −ln (1−X) versus t, the pseudo-first order rate constants were observed. The results indicated that the reaction rate constants increase linearly with the increase of stirring rate from 100 to 400 rpm, indicating that mass transfer played an important role during the reaction process. However, further increase of stirring speed from 400 to 500 rpm didn't showed significant improvement for the reaction rate. Similar findings have been reported elsewhere. 3,29 Therefore, all subsequent experiments were carried out at a speed of agitation of 400 rpm (Fig. 6 ). 2.5.3 Effect of the amount of l-β-CD Kinetic experiments were performed by varying the amounts of l-β-CD from 0 to 1.0 g. The results were shown in Fig. 7 . From Fig. 7, the rate constants calculated from the linear plots of −ln (1−X) versus t were linearly dependent on the amounts of catalyst used, and they were significantly increased with the increase of the amounts of l-β-CD. 12.4% conversion of BzOH was observed in the absence of l-β-CD. The conversion increased from 24.5% to 57.2% by increasing the catalyst amounts from 0.2 g to 1.0 g, indicating that the catalyst was necessary for the oxidation of BzOH. The results indicated that the addition of more catalysts was associated with higher conversion rate because more active sites were involved in the oxidation. However, no appreciable differences in the BzOH conversion were observed with the use of above 0.8 g l-β-CD. The linear dependence of reaction rate on catalyst concentration indicated that the reaction was controlled through extraction mechanism. Yang et al. have also reported similar observations for the oxidation of cinnamaldehyde under phase-transfer catalysis conditions. 28 Thus, 0.8 g l-β-CD was applied in the following experiments. 2.5.4 Effect of temperature The effect of reaction temperature on the conversion rate of BzOH was investigated in the temperature range 30–60 °C. The kinetic profiles of the reaction were obtained by plotting −ln (1−X) versus t as demonstrated in Fig. 8 . It is obvious that the catalytic performance significantly increased with the increase of temperature from 30 to 60 °C with the conversion from 21.6% to 51.8%. The rate constant k was calculated from the slope of the kinetic plot. The plot of k against reaction temperature was observed to be a straight line passing through the origin. Fig. 8 indicated that first-order dependence of the reaction rate on the reaction temperature. The parameters k (rate constant, min−1) and R (correlation coefficient) of oxidation process were shown in Table 1 . It can be seen that BzOH conversion rate significantly improved with increasing temperature. The rate constants were found to increase from 0.00106 min−1 to 0.03003 min−1 with the temperature from 30 to 60 °C. The activation energy (E a ) was calculated from Arrhenius plot of ln k and 1/T with a good linear correlation. E a in the presence and absence of l-β-CD were calculated as 30.33 and 54.78 kJ/mol, respectively. It is obvious that l-β-CD could decrease the energy barrier of the oxidation of BzOH, indicating that it is an efficient catalyst for the reaction. 2.5.5 Effect of amount of H2O2 The oxidation rate of BzOH as a function of H2O2 amount was investigated in Fig. 9 . From Fig. 9, the amount of H2O2 played a key role for the oxidation of BzOH. The results clearly showed that the conversion of BzOH increased linearly with increasing the amount of H2O2, reached a maximum (>99%) at 2.5 mL at around 8 h. The conversion was almost constant for the amount of H2O2 in the range from 2.5 mL to 3.5 mL. Generally speaking, 1 mol of BzOH requires for 1 mol of H2O2 for the conversion to BzH. The much excessive amount of H2O2 was decomposed at the higher temperature. However, oxygen released from the decomposition reaction hasn't any contribution for the oxidation of BzOH. Therefore, 2.5 mL H2O2 was found to be the optimum for the reaction. 2.5.6 Effect of the amount of NaHCO3 The effect of the amount of NaHCO3 on the conversion of BzOH was studied and the results were shown in Fig. 10 . From Fig. 10, the amount of NaHCO3 played an important role for the oxidation of BzOH. The previously reported results showed that H2O2 is an oxidant of high oxygen content and environmentally friendly with water as the sole byproduct. 45,46 The low conversion (4%) was obtained with 4% yield of BzH in the absence of NaHCO3. BzH yield was significantly increased with the increase of the amount of NaHCO3. The reaction gave 99% BzH yield by employing 1.5 mmol NaHCO3. The result indicated that hydrogen peroxide is a rather slow oxidizing agent in the absence of activator. Activation of hydrogen peroxide by sodium bicarbonate has been reported by Richardson before. 47,48 Our present investigation was focused on the oxidation of BzOH by peroxymonocarbonate ion (HCO4 −1). In this model, peroxymonocarbonate, a true peroxide with a structure of HOOCO2 −1, was produced from bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide, and subsequently oxidized BzOH to BzH."
7,The oxidation of substituted BzOHs,"2.6 The oxidation of substituted BzOHs Under optimized conditions, the oxidation of substituted BzOHs catalyzed by l-β-CD has also been investigated and summarized in Table 2 . From Table 2, l-β-CD displayed some uses towards different benzyl alcohols to produce the corresponding BzHs. β-CD in l-β-CD can form host-guest complexes with substituted BzOHs. The size, shape and hydrophobicity of guest molecules significantly affect their oxidation. In addition, the electronic nature of substituent groups on BzOHs has a significant effect on the catalytic oxidation of organic substrates. In the present study, methoxyl-, methyl-substituted BzOHs produced the corresponding BzHs with 96–99% yield (entries 1–6). However, nitro-substituted BzOHs could only achieve 79–83% yield (entries 7–9). Table 2 also indicated that the steric hindrance of the substituent groups also has a certain effect on the catalytic activity. Higher yields of p-substituted BzOHs (entries 1, 6, and 7) to corresponding BzHs were given than those of the o-(entries 3, 4, and 9), m-substituted (entries 2, 5, and 8) BzOHs. It was attributed that p-substituted BzOHs have less steric hindrance than those of the o-, m-substituted BzOHs. However, no activity has been observed for the aliphatic alcohols or secondary alcohols (entries 10 and 11)."
8,Reusability of the catalyst,"2.7 Reusability of the catalyst In order to further evaluate the performance of the catalyst, l-β-CD was used repeatedly for six cycles to test its catalytic reusability. The catalyst was recovered by filtration after each run, and then it was reused in the next run under the same reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 11 , it can be seen that its catalytic activity was not significantly affected after five cycles. The results indicated the prepared l-β-CD was stable and it can be efficiently recycled and reused."
9,Reaction mechanism,"2.8 Reaction mechanism Based on the above experimental data, a plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed for l-β-CD catalyzed-oxidation of BzOH by hydrogen peroxide with bicarbonate ion (Fig. 12 ). Firstly, β-CD in l-β-CD and BzOH can form the inclusion complex via intermolecular hydrogen bonding O–H⋯O at the rim of β-CD. The host-guest interaction between BzOH and the parent β-CD has been previously reported. 49 In addition, the synergistic effects between β-CD and the functional groups of lignin enhanced the intermolecular interactions. The inclusion complexes transferred from the organic phase to the aqueous solution phase. With the addition of sodium bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide solution, peroxymonocarbonate (HCO4 −1), a peroxide with a structure of HOOCO2 −1, reacted with BzOH to produce an intermediate, which was then converted to BzH with loss of H2O molecule. Finally, the catalyst transferred to the organic phase for further regeneration to be an active intermediate."
10,Conclusions,"In this paper, β-CD grafted on lignin was prepared and characterized by FTIR, TG, SEM, and solid state CP/MAS 13C NMR technique. It was employed for the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes. Under the optimized conditions, the catalytic system l-β-CD/H2O2/NaHCO3 was quite effective for the oxidation of a variety of substrates including the substituted benzyl alcohols in good yields (79–99%) within 8 h. Compared to the previously reported precious metal catalysts, this catalytic system demonstrated higher selectivity (>99%) and mild reaction conditions (60 °C). The synergistic effects based on weak interactions between the β-CD and the support effectively promote oxidation of benzyl alcohols under aqueous solution. The catalyst could be easily recycled and reused for five runs, which indicated its highly potential application foreground for environmental friendly synthesis of BzH."
11,Experimental section,
12,General,"4.1 General Alkali lignin was obtained from Shandong Yiyuan Xuemei Paper Company, Ltd., China. β-CD was purchased from Shanghai Boao Biotechnology, China. Epichlorohydrin (EPI) was supplied from Tianjin Damao, China. BzOH (>99%) was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., China. All other reagents and solvents are of analytical grade and used without further purification unless indicated."
13,Synthesis of l-β-CD,"4.2 Synthesis of l-β-CD l-β-CD was prepared by reacting β-CD with lignin cross-linked by EPI in sodium hydroxide solution according to the reported method with some modification. 36 5 g of lignin, 4.25 g of sodium hydroxide, and 25 mL deionized water were added to 100 mL three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer. Then, 50 mL of EPI was added dropwise to the mixture. The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 3 h under nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitate was centrifuged, washed twice with 50 mL of toluene to remove EPI thoroughly, and then washed with a large amount of distilled water until filtrate was neutral. The product was dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h. The lignin modified by EPI (abbreviated as LE) was obtained. l-β-CD was further prepared as follow procedure: a mixture of LE powder (2 g), sodium hydroxide (6 g), and 30 mL water was agitated at room temperature for 1 h. Then, different amounts of β-CD were added. The reaction mixture was heated to 50 °C and kept stirring for 24 h under nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained precipitate was isolated by filtration and washed to neutral with distilled water. The resultant solid was dried in vacuum at 50 °C for 24 h. The preparation procedure of l-β-CD is illustrated in Scheme 1 ."
14,Characterizations of l-β-CD,"4.3 Characterizations of l-β-CD FTIR spectra of β-CD, lignin, LE, and l-β-CD were recorded on a Bruker TENSOR 37 FTIR spectrometer using KBr as background. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a Netzsch STA-449C thermal analysis system. The samples were put inside the platinum pans, which were hanging in the heating furnace. The weight percentage of the residue was recorded while the furnace was heating from 25 to 550 °C. The flow rate of nitrogen was about 40 mL/min, and a heating rate of 10 °C/min was employed. SEM was used to observe the morphology of the samples (FE-SEM, JSM-6330F). The samples were coated with thin layer of gold prior to examination under the electron beam. An operating voltage of 25 kV was used. The solid-state CP/MAS 13C NMR data of the samples were operated at a BRUKER AVANCE II 500 MHz spectrometer to determine the successful graft of β-CD on the surface of lignin."
15,Catalytic performance,"4.4 Catalytic performance The catalytic oxidation of BzOH was carried out in a 50 mL three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer. In a typical procedure, BzOH (0.108 g, 1 mmol) and catalyst (0.8 g) was placed into the flask containing 25 mL of water and the reaction mixture was heated in an oil bath with continuous stirring at 60 °C. 2.5 mL of 30% H2O2 together with 0.126 g (1.5 mmol) sodium bicarbonate was slowly introduced into the reactor and the mixture was stirred for 8 h. During the reaction, 0.5 mL of the sample was withdrawn periodically from the mixture and extracted by with 5 mL ethyl acetate. After centrifugation, the extracted organic phase was analyzed by GC (Agilent7890). 0.5 mL water was then added to keep the volume of the reaction mixture constant. After the reaction, the catalyst was filtered and washed thoroughly with water. The separated catalyst was dried, and then reused again to test its reusability. All the kinetic experiments were carried out for three times and good reproducibility was found with the error percentage within 5%."
