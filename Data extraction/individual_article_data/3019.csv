0,Introduction,"Increasing energy demands have not only resulted in the extensive eradication of nonrenewable petroleum reserves, but also worsened global warming and climate change that are exerting a profound impact on 21-century humans [1]. As a result, concerns about fossil fuel depletion and environmental deterioration have prompted research to search for alternative renewable energy. Among the candidates, biodiesel has attracted the attention of researchers as a promising alternative fuel [2]. Biodiesel is a biodegradable and environmentally sustainable biofuel that has the potential to provide an alternative energy source to petroleum diesel [3]. Biodiesel is obtained from biological sources such as edible and non-edible oils, animal fats, and waste cooking oils. Today, several countries have regulations and policies that promote alternative fuels such as biodiesel through both incentives and quantitative binding requirements. In 2020, ethanol and biodiesel provided 3% of total transport energy globally, increased by 5% from 2019 [4]. Although the electric transport system is attracting interest recently, ethanol and biodiesel combined still account for more than 90% of renewable transport fuels, with 336.5 million barrels of biodiesel produced globally in 2017 [5]. Fig. 1 shows the life cycle of sustainable biodiesel production. Biodiesel could be produced from different physicochemical processes, and the primary methods include transesterification, esterification, pyrolysis, and supercritical fluids. Among all these methods, transesterification is the most common process of biodiesel production where fatty acid alkyl ester and glycerin are produced in the chemical reaction of triglycerides and alcohol in the presence of catalysts. Various raw materials such as vegetable oils, algae oils, animal fats, microbial oils, and waste oils can be used as feedstock in biodiesel production depending upon the method of treatment [6–9]. Besides, use of biodiesel can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions with good economics, which is evidenced by burning biodiesel produced from vegetable oil, an excellent feedstock for biodiesel production [4]. Although the traditional production technologies such as transesterification are a major pathway for biodiesel production, the production efficiency has largely reached its ceiling with high production costs and little room for further improvement, which is the main reason that biodiesel such produced is unable to economically compete with petroleum-based diesel in today's transportation market [10]. Therefore, the call for biodiesel production by new, clean, and improved technologies is intensifying in recent years. These new and green processes must be able to shorten reaction times while maintaining high biodiesel quality. They must be more environmentally friendly with lower energy consumption. To that end, numerous methods have been explored recently including ultrasonic, microwave, hydrodynamic cavitation, membrane, plasma, reactive distillation, supercritical, cosolvent, rotatory, and plug flow reactors for biodiesel production to reduce reaction time, energy consumption, and catalyst requirements [10–16]. However, the large volume of information regarding these new endeavors is existing in disarray, which creates difficulties for researchers to gain a holistic understanding of the status of developing new and more efficient technologies for biodiesel production. Besides, the many published review articles in the field of biodiesel production technology are either subject specific [1,7,9–11,14,15] or too general [2,17–19] without thorough comparisons among feedstocks, reactor designs, catalysts, and technologies. More importantly, the most recent development in biodiesel synthesis technologies such as the liquid-phase plasma process to fast convert virgin oils to biodiesel is not covered in all past reviews. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the different biodiesel production technologies explored, with a focus mainly on the technological advancements in enhancing the chemical reaction processes. This review is also aimed to facilitate researchers to analyze and compare different new and conventional technologies in biodiesel production."
1,Biodiesel production,
2,Feedstock,"2.1 Feedstock The feedstock for biodiesel production is mainly sourced from biomass of renewable origins, like oil plants, algae, and fats. Depending on the source of feedstock, they can be classified into four different categories. The specific purity and composition of each feedstock can help us better understand the process of production of different generations of biodiesel, which is shown in Fig. 2 . 2.1.1 First-generation feedstock All feedstocks sourced from edible food crops are referred to as the first-generation biodiesel feedstocks, e.g., corn, soybean, palm oil, mustard oil, etc. [20]. The main advantages of first-generation raw materials are the availability of crops and relatively simple conversion processes. However, the main disadvantage of using these raw materials is the reduced food supply, thus potentially increasing food prices. These shortcomings force users to switch to other alternative raw materials for biodiesel production [21,22]. 2.1.2 Second generation feedstock The limitations of first-generation feedstocks call for exploration of the environmentally friendly, low-cost second-generation oils to help reduce food inequality. The main advantage of the second-generation biodiesel is that it does not rely on edible plants and does not require agricultural land [23]. The disadvantages of second-generation fuel include the low yield of non-edible crops and the need to increase the amount of alcohol in reaction. To overcome these problems inherent to non-edible oils, researchers are considering new alternatives that are economically viable and more affordable. The use of economically sustainable non-edible oils is to increase biodiesel production efficiency and the possibility of commercial production at industrial scale [24,25]. Sandbox seed oil [26], calophyllum inophyllum oil [27], safflower [28], silybum marianum oil [29], styrax officinalis L. seed oil [30], phoenix dactylifera [31], bitter almond oil [32], euonymus maackii rupr. Seed oil [33], and ailanthus altissima [34] are some of the typical second-generation feedstocks recently used in biodiesel production. 2.1.3 Third generation feedstock The third-generation biodiesel is produced from waste oil and algal biomass. The main advantages of the third-generation feedstock are higher growth and productivity, no agricultural land needed, higher oil content, and less impact on food supply. Fish oil, animal fat, microalgae, and waste cooking oil are the primary sources of the third-generation biodiesel feedstocks [35]. The main disadvantages include the high initial investment cost and limitations to using at the industrial scale. For example, the algal biomass as biodiesel feedstock involves harvesting, drying, and extraction processes, which consequently increases the production cost of the system [36,37]. In waste oil or waste cooking oils, the variation of different sourced feedstocks and usability change the chemical composition of the feedstocks and limit the production at a large scale because of the impurities and varying compositions of the used oils. In addition, different animal fats are also used as dependable feedstock for biodiesel production [38]. Meat processing dissolved air flotation sludge [39], bardawil lagoon [40], and waste coffee grounds oil [41] are a few new third-generation feedstocks used for biodiesel production in recent years. 2.1.4 Fourth generation feedstock The fourth generation of biodiesel is based on capturing and utilizing CO2 and solar energy to produce biomass that is then converted into fuel through the same process as second-generation biofuels, thus featuring carbon-neutral [42]. The development of synthetic biology has thrusted the direct conversion of solar energy and CO2 as an ideal technology to produce renewable and clean fuels, e.g., photobiological solar biodiesel [43,44], but research in this area is still in its infancy. The production process is a set of operations that transform different inputs in different ranges into the required outputs, which involves two primary functions, i.e., transforming and utilizing the transformed resources, with each production process involving a link of production chain reactions. In the next section, both the physiochemical and enzymatically catalyzed production processes involved in biodiesel transformation will be reviewed and discussed."
3,Oil extraction,"2.2 Oil extraction The sustainable and economical supply of raw materials is significant in the industrialization of biodiesel. One of the most expensive and energy-intensive processes in biodiesel production is oil extraction from the feedstock. To attain a sustainable supply of oil, physical, chemical, and enzymatic methods have been tested to maximize oil extraction. In this section, a few of the most advanced technologies developed in recent times will be discussed. 2.2.1 Physical oil extraction In the physical process, the mechanical press is the most effective conventional technology, which is still being used at small and large scales to extract oil from seeds. Different processing mechanisms have been developed to attain maximum oil extraction, such as screw press and Ram press [45]. The mechanical press design is very important in a machine-driven press system and specific modification is mainly adopted depending on the raw feedstocks used for oil extraction. The pre-treatment has also been very helpful in increasing the extraction yield in the mechanical oil extraction process. On average, 60–80% oil can be extracted in one pass depending on the type of presser, and by adding pretreatment techniques, and the overall oil yield increases up to 91% [46]. 2.2.2 Chemical oil extraction The most common chemical method used in oil extraction is leaching. It is a process in which liquid solvent is used to extract oil from the solid phase. Hexane is the most commonly used liquid solvent for oil extraction. In comparison to mechanical press systems, chemical solvent extraction is more expensive; however, the extraction yields in the chemical process are up to 95% [47]. Although the chemical approach has been able to achieve a very high yield, there are certain limitations. The extraction time is very high, and increasing temperature in the leaching process can disturb the product quality and possible environmental concerns due to toxic solvents used in the chemical process [48]. 2.2.3 Enzymatic extraction Enzymatic oil extraction is a biological oil extraction process in which certain types of enzymes are utilized to extract fatty acids from plants and seeds. Compared to the chemical process, the enzymatic approach is much more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Its ability to work for many kinds of raw feedstock makes enzymatic oil extraction a promising future technology. The maximum conversion yield in enzymatic oil extraction ranges from 70 to 97%, depending on reaction conditions and pretreatment [49,50]. Although the process is energy efficient and environment friendly, the average reaction time is very long to complete the reaction process. Besides these, supercritical fluid extraction and microwave-assisted extraction techniques have also been adopted in oil extraction for biodiesel production [51,52]."
4,Biodiesel production methods,"2.3 Biodiesel production methods 2.3.1 Physical methods In 1893, direct peanut oil was used for the first time in the compression engine as diesel fuel by Rudolf Diesel [53]. Since natural oil does not change its characteristics, different additives and physical modifications were applied to vegetable oils to improve their viscosity and volatility to be used as diesel fuel. After complications with direct vegetable oil use in diesel engines, researchers investigated the possibility of blending vegetable oil with diesel at different ratios as the engine fuel, which had been the trend since the late 1920s until 1982 when the first international conference was held on the effect and cost factors involved in the use of blended oil as fuel in diesel engines [18,54]. Although direct use of vegetable oil (or blending it into diesel) has low production cost, the mixture requires much pretreatment to run effectively in diesel engines. The solidification of the highly viscous solution in cold weather has made it impractical to use in engines directly. Besides, the high free fatty acid content with unsaturated hydrocarbons increases the oxidation, which increases the wearing of an engine and the associated maintenance cost. Microemulsion is one of the physical methods to use vegetable oil in a diesel engine without chemical treatment [18]. Microemulsions are produced by adding esters and dispersants (solvents) to vegetable oil with or without diesel fuel to form a clear and thermodynamically stable dispersion of oil with surfactants [19]. Due to their higher alcohol content, microemulsions have a lower calorific value than diesel, but these alcohols have a higher latent heat property and can cool the combustion chamber, thus reducing the coking of the nozzle. Microemulsions of methanol and vegetable oil work almost as well as diesel fuel. There were past reports focused on co-surfactant influence and determining the effect of catalysts in water oil microemulsion produced from different refined and high free fatty acids (FFA) oils [55,56]. A few thermochemical liquefication studies were focused on using waste sludge mixed with different co-surfactants to produce diesel fuel via microemulsion to improve its use and enhance the physicochemical properties of the emulsified fuel. However, due to the heavy carbon waste and very low efficiency, further research is needed to improve this technology for large scale utilization [57,58]. 2.3.2 Chemical methods Natural oils could be changed into different esters as diesel fuel by heat treatment or pyrolysis, which is the conversion of one organic substance into another. Thermally heated substances include vegetable oils, animal fats, natural fatty acids, and fatty acid methyl esters. Many researchers have studied triglyceride pyrolysis to produce suitable fuel for diesel engines [59,60]. Despite the flexibility of pyrolysis technology for different kinds of oils, it has not been adequately evaluated due to the high cost and complexity of the equipment. Moreover, the biofuels produced do not contain required fuel properties, and the reaction conditions are very extreme, resulting in the formation of short-chain molecules closer to petrol than to diesel. The production of biofuel from waste cooking oil by pyrolysis yields around an 80% conversion efficiency with better heating values, and its byproducts are also consumable fertilizers [61,62]. The most common chemical method for converting natural oils and fats into diesel fuel is transesterification, a stoichiometric reaction of 3 molecules of alcohol with 1 molecule of triglycerides. This process is carried out in the presence of a catalyst, which results in the formation of alkyl esters (biodiesel) and glycerin as a byproduct [63–66]. The reaction kinetics of transesterification of triglyceride was investigated, and it was found that the total conversion did not change with temperature, but the speed of the transesterification process increased with temperature. The overall reaction kinetics depended on the individual constants of the triglyceride conversion rate to diglycerides, monoglycerides, and alcohol esters. The transesterification rate at higher temperatures was higher because, at higher temperatures, the time required for mass transfer was reduced [67]. Many of the alkyl esters are sourced from biomass made from natural fats and oils. They can be obtained by esterification of fatty acids or transesterification of triglycerides. The main distinguishing feature is the use of a catalyst to produce alkyl esters [68]. Fig. 3 shows the equations of transesterification and esterification processes."
5,Factors affecting the reaction process,"2.4 Factors affecting the reaction process Biodiesel is primarily produced through the chemical method, i.e., the transesterification reaction catalyzed by different catalysts. In general, the catalysts used in the transesterification process for biodiesel production can be classified into three categories, i.e., homogeneous, heterogeneous, and biological (Fig. 4 ). In this section, the roles of the existing and the recently developed catalysts for biodiesel production are reviewed and discussed. 2.4.1 Homogenous catalyst Homogeneous catalysts, such as bases and acids, are traditionally used for biodiesel reactions because they are inexpensive and efficient. However, the downside is the requirement of high energy input for complete conversion. Between these catalysts, the alkaline catalyzed transesterification offers almost 4000 times the speed of an acid-catalyzed reaction [70]. The commonly used primary homogeneous catalysts are NaOH, KOH, sodium methoxide, and potassium methoxide [71–73], among which NaOH and KOH are used the most. Sodium-based catalysts are preferable to potassium-based catalysts because of their lower molecular weight and better separation phase. A simple mechanism is employed in producing biodiesel using homogeneous base catalysts whereby intermediates are formed by the interaction between the harmful types of the initially introduced alcohol (e.g., CH3O−) and the carbonyl group of the oil (triglycerides). Purified oils containing less than 0.5% of FFA oil are catalyzed by base catalysts to produce high-quality biodiesel with a high yield within 30–60 min [74]. Vicente et al. [73] conducted a comparative study on NaOH and KOH for biodiesel production from sunflower oil and achieved 85.9 and 91.67 wt% yield of esters for NaOH and KOH, respectively, under constant catalyst conditions. Although increasing conversion rate with increasing catalyst concentration was observed, such rate increases disappeared after hitting 1% w/w [75]. Acidic catalysts are used less frequently in transesterification reactions than base catalysts, mainly because of their lower reaction rates. The typical acids commonly used in transesterification reactions include sulfuric acid, sulphonic acid, hydrochloric acid, and ferrous sulfate, among which hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid are generally preferred [18,76,77]. The bonding of carbonyl groups serves as the basis for strong inorganic acids by distorting electrons and resonant dipoles due to the difference in the electro-negative atoms of oxygen and carbon. The reaction mechanism starts with the formation of cations, and in the second stage, alcohol acts as a nucleophile in the carbocation. Since there are many alcohol molecules in the solution in this reaction, the proton can transfer to one of the hydroxyl groups to make the hydroxyl group secede from the reaction. An alcohol‑oxygen atom from a hydroxyl group can sacrifice a pair of electrons to the carbon atom to create a pi-bond and remove water. Since water is less concentrated than alcohol, the reverse reaction is not possible with nucleophiles [78]. Homogeneous acid catalysts normally provide higher biodiesel yields, but the reaction rate is too low. The main factor that influences the reaction is the molar ratio of alcohol to oil. Since acid catalysts presented low reaction rates while base catalysts were poor in handling the free fatty acids (FFAs) in waste fats and/or non-edible type oils, Serio et al. [79] studied the use of different carboxylic salts as homogenous catalysts in biodiesel production from high FFA content oils. Their results concluded that when Pb(Ac)2 was used as the catalyst, it was possible to obtain high biodiesel yield (96%) and a low final FFA concentration (1%) with a lower molar methanol/oil ratio (12/1) in a relatively short reaction time (< 200 min). 2.4.2 Heterogenous catalyst A heterogeneous catalyst is defined as a catalyst that has a different phase in terms of reactant or product. Despite the higher cost, homogenous base catalysts have been favored in the biodiesel industry mainly due to the fast-kinetic reaction and low cost. The use of heterogeneous catalysts can considerably reduce the cost and easily recover biodiesel. In the recent past, much work has been done in the development of new heterogeneous base and acid catalysts. Heterogeneous forms of base catalysts are intended to overcome the limitations associated with using homogeneous base catalysts, such as saponification, which prevents the release of glycerol from the alkyl ester layer [60,80]. The disadvantage of heterogeneous base catalysts is their big attraction to moisture during storage. Besides, the high FFA content causes washing problems in the presence of solid catalysts, resulting in the formation of soap, which affects the yield of biodiesel fuel [81–83]. Research and development of solid catalysts for biodiesel production were aimed at studying the influence of the chemical properties of the carrier on the catalytic activity. Recently, a new heterogeneous base catalyst based on barium aluminate (BaAl2O4) and waste vegetable oil was used for the synthesis of biodiesel by transesterification [84]. The results showed that a methyl ester conversion rate of 93.28% was achieved when the transesterification reaction was carried out at a molar ratio of 21:1 for methanol and oil, a catalyst volume of 4 wt%, a reaction temperature of 65 ± 0.5 °C, a reaction time of 150 min, and a mixing speed of 600 rpm. The possibility of reusing the synthetic catalyst after high-temperature regeneration under optimized reaction conditions for five cycles was also investigated [84,85]. Many of the heterogeneous base catalysts studied are focused on metal oxides and zeolites, with calcium oxide being one of the most studied catalysts. These catalysts have proven to be active in transesterification of oils with low FFA content. Heterogeneous acid catalysts are preferred to homogeneous acids, although their catalytic activity is lower than that of homogeneous acids. This is due to the strength of Bronsted and Lewis acids. Heterogeneous acid catalysts have been developed by combining the properties of heterogeneous base catalysts and mineral acids (e.g., cation exchange resins, supported heteropoly acids, sulfonated solids, zeolites, metal oxides, etc.) that are moisture-resistant, have resistance against high FFA content, and, at the same time, can carry out both transesterification and esterification reactions [86,87]. Recently, the use of waste biomass as a heterogeneous acid catalyst was evaluated [88], in which the catalytic properties of carbon-based catalysts derived from papaya seeds, empty fruit bunches (EFBs), and corncob biomass waste were used to produce biodiesel. The influence of catalytic synthesis conditions, including carbonization temperature (600–1000 °C), sulfonation time (0.5–2.5 h), and sulfate acid/activated carbon weight ratio (3:1–13:1) on fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) yield and FFA conversion coefficient was estimated. Under optimal catalyst synthesis conditions, activated carbon catalysts showed the highest FAME yield and FFA conversion rates of 72.09% and 93.49%, respectively. New hybrid aerogel CaO/Al2O3, a heterogeneous catalyst, successfully produced biodiesel, and the maximum biodiesel yield (89.9%) and high purity (98.0%) were achieved. Optimal conditions were 1 wt% 3:1 CaO/Al2O3 calcined aerogel for a reaction carried out at 65 °C for 4 h with a methanol to oil molar ratio of 11:1 [89]. Table 1 presents the catalysts studied for biodiesel production in the most recent times (2018–2021). 2.4.3 Enzymatic catalyst Lipases are the enzyme mostly used in biodiesel production, which are hydrolases because they hydrolyze triglycerides to convert into glycerol and fatty acids. Lipase can be obtained from various sources: plants, fungi, animals, and bacteria [90]. The lipase introduced by plants is found in their energy reserve tissue, such as oilseeds. Animal sources of lipases are the pancreatic glands of cattle and pigs. Animal lipase is widely used in the dairy and food industries [91,92]. However, microbial lipase is the most common source of enzymes used in biodiesel processes. The use of enzyme catalysis in transesterification reactions offers significant advantages over chemical catalysis. Enzyme catalysts using immobilized or soluble lipases are environmentally friendly and can be used as active catalysts to convert oils into biodiesel in the presence of large amounts of FFA and water [93]. An enzymatic catalyst requires neither processing of the feedstock nor disposal of the catalyst. Besides, it reacts under mild conditions and with low energy consumption, providing a sustainable method of biodiesel production [94]. The reaction mechanisms of the enzymatic catalysts vary, as they have positive and negative charges. An active site with acidic or basic properties triggers a reaction by donating or accepting a proton via a mechanism called the Bi-model. The behavior during the absorption or release of protons is related to the type of enzyme used. Enzymes such as lipase act as acceptors of hydroxyl groups (OH−), while other enzymes such as amine groups donate protons. To overcome the high cost of lipase, researchers have focused on crosslinking the enzyme with different nanoscale materials to increase its activity and conversion yield. In a recent study, amino-coated magnetite nanoparticles were combined with a cross-linked enzyme of the Km12 lipase [95]. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that the mCLEAs lip nanocomposites had a spherical structure and were active up to six reuse cycles of the enzyme. When incubated at 4 °C for 24 days, it retained 60% higher initial activity than free enzymes. Immobilization of the enzyme increased biodiesel production from waste cooking oil by about 20% compared to free enzymes [89]. The most recent research reports (2018–2021) on the application of enzymatic catalysts for converting natural oils and fats into biodiesel are also included in Table 1. When ignoring the operating conditions, the average yield efficiencies and standard deviations are 95.5 ± 3.27, 96.4 ± 1.85, and 90.5 ± 9.08% for acid, base, and enzymatic catalysts, respectively. Due to large variations in the data from enzymatic catalysts, there is no statistical difference in yield efficiency among the three catalysts. That said, it seems that base catalysts are the most stable while the enzymatic catalysts are the least. Carefully examining the data of enzymatic catalysts shown in Table 1 appears to suggest that selecting an appropriate enzymatic catalyst for a specific substrate is critical to achieving good yield efficiency of biodiesel production."
6,Role of alcohol,"2.5 Role of alcohol Transesterification is a chemical reaction of triglycerides using a mono-alcohol and a catalyst to produce alkyl esters. To date, researchers and industry have opted for methanol, despite it being derived from fossil fuels, as the primary alcohol to derive alkyl ester from triglycerides solely because of its low price and less sensitivity to water in alkali reaction. The biomass-derived alcohol, e.g., butanol, and higher hydrocarbon are not discussed extensively as a sustainable option at industrial scale biodiesel production [128]. Methanol is very toxic for human health; even a low concentration of methanol can cause serious health problems — directly affecting the human respiratory system. In comparison, ethanol is less toxic than methanol and its solvency properties are better for oils. Methoxide (methanol + catalyst) is a very hazardous material and requires careful handling. Methanol also has low solubility [129]. Low pour point and cloud point values are critical to helping biodiesel to start engines at low temperatures, especially in cold weather [130]. Biobutanol as alcohol can improve the low pour point and cloud point values of biodiesel and all the esters produced by biobutanol also satisfy all other biodiesel quality standards [131]. In recent works, experimental research has recognized that the engine performance of ethyl ester is also slightly better than that of methyl ester [132]. The NOx emission in the four-stroke direct-injected Ci engine was 880 ppm and 867 ppm for methyl ester and ethyl ester, respectively. The smoke emission at maximum load was 96 HSU and 92 HSU for methyl ester and ethyl ester. The cumulative heat release for the engine (5.3 kW) was 1413.98 kJ/m3 degree. The B40 (40% biodiesel 60% diesel) blends of both esters were also tested. The cumulative heat release for the ethyl ester blend was higher than methyl ester. Another detailed experiment was conducted using different alcohol from methanol to butanol [133]. The length of the alkyl chain decreased the efficiency in biodiesel conversion, which might be due to the catalysts used in the production process (long-chain alcohol may need a different catalyst to perform well). The use of higher alcohols to produce biodiesel can positively affect biodiesel's fuel properties and lubricity, improve existing technologies to achieve higher yields, and reduce the time required to achieve equilibrium."
7,Biodiesel purification,"2.6 Biodiesel purification The industrial-scale production of biodiesel is limited mainly because of the high price of feedstock; however, the other most important factor affecting large-scale biodiesel production is the consistent standard of high-quality biodiesel, which requires an immaculate purification process of biodiesel produced. The main objective in purification is to remove all the excess reactants and byproducts from biodiesel. Based on the process, the purification techniques used in biodiesel production can be classified into three main groups. 2.6.1 Wet washing The distilled or low acid water is used to wash the biodiesel product multiple times to remove all the excess impurities. It can be performed at room temperature or using hot water up to 50 °C. It is a simple and economically efficient method to purify biodiesel products; however, a large amount of wastewater is produced in this process, which causes major environmental concerns as the treatment of biodiesel wastewater is much more complex than other waste streams. Acidified water wash is more effective than simple distilled water wash. The most common acid used in washing is phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and hydrochloric acid [134]. The acidified water can use much less water to remove the excess by-product; however, it can also acidify the biodiesel. The most efficient techniques used in industry are the addition of distilled water wash at the end of the acid wash circle to neutralize the final product. In recent times, ionic liquids have also been utilized in the wet washing process. Different kinds of organic, inorganic, and organometallic liquids have been tested at a lab-scale to examine the separation ability of the ionic liquids in the biodiesel purification process [135,136]. 2.6.2 Dry washing As an alternative to replace wet washing with a more sustainable and environmentally friendly process, different kinds of adsorbents and resins have been used to separate glycerol and impurities from biodiesel. The most commonly used dry washing adsorbent is magnesol. Although the dry washing process can separate impurities from biodiesel, the efficiency is still lowered compared to the water washing process. Silica-based adsorbents such as zeolites and silica gels have also been effective in biodiesel purification [137]. An alternative to metal-based, the more economical and environment-friendly activated biomass-based adsorbents have also been found very effective in purifying biodiesel [138]. 2.6.3 Membrane purification Although water washing is the most effective purification process, it produces a large amount of wastewater. The membrane technology, on the other hand, provides a very effective purification process with no wastewater production. The membrane purification system is very well developed in water purification. It has already been opted at a commercial scale, but for non-aqueous solutions, the membrane separation technology is still at the development stage. In recent times, both organic and inorganic membranes have been tested to extract high-quality fatty acid alkyl ester (biodiesel) [136]. The phase behaviors of the by-products present in biodiesel are very important in the membrane filtration process. Since the complex products of methanol/ethanol, water, glycerol, and catalyst are present in the mixture, it becomes complicated for the membrane filtration system to identify and separate the biodiesel. Ceramic and ultrafiltration membranes have been the most effective in purifying biodiesel compared to other organic and inorganic membrane systems [139]. The precipitation methods have also been effective in removing excess catalysts from biodiesel. The precipitated compound can be filtered or separated from purified biodiesel. The main advantage of this process is without losing any biodiesel; however, the quality of the purified product needs further processing. There is a need to do more investigation into the operating parameters of the precipitation process to attain a high-quality end-product."
8,Biodiesel production reactors,"The production of biodiesel by conventional methods has many disadvantages, such as high energy consumption, difficulties in reducing glycerin, sensitivity to water, and a very low reaction rate. On the other hand, lipase (enzyme catalyst) methods also have disadvantages such as high catalyst costs and long reaction times. The initial phase of the chemical reaction has diffusion limitation due to oil and alcohol's limited solubility. Less mixing reduces the rate of mass transfer across the interface. When diffusion is restricted, the overall reaction rate is reduced. To counteract this effect, various technical methods are used to increase interactions between the phases. In this section, the latest process technologies aimed to improve chemical reactions and the physical separation of byproducts are reviewed and discussed."
9,Batch and continuous reactors,"3.1 Batch and continuous reactors Various reactor designs have been developed to convert oils and alcohols into biofuels, such as batch and continuous reactors. The batch reactor can be a simple stirred tank containing the reagents used in the process with a stirrer that can be switched on while maintaining a controlled temperature for a specific time. The operation of a semi-continuous reactor is similar to that of a batch reactor but needs additional controls to be installed to maintain proper mixing for uniform chemical composition and temperature. As such, this method is labor-intensive and rarely used. Some continuous flow reactors can also operate in batch mode. Continuous operation usually requires process and operational control. The reactor types used for biodiesel production vary, and the required operating conditions can be achieved based on the chemical properties and physical operating parameters of the reactants, reagents, and products. The schematics of the basic batch and continuous stirred tank reactors from literature are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . Batch mode reactors are the most commonly used method at industrial-scale production and most of the batch scale setup are primarily developed from lab-scale trials by optimizing the feed rate, reaction temperature, and agitation system. The reactor design to achieve the highest output could be based on feedstock availability, and slight variation can also be adapted based on varying output requirements. One of the critical factors to achieve high efficiency in batch reactors is the precise time calculations and temperature control. The latter is adjusted based on the chemistry of the reaction to achieve the highest reaction rate with low input energy and time [140]. Different types of rotary reactors suitable for biodiesel production are defined elsewhere [143]. The most used form of biodiesel reactor is batch stirred reactors, in which a cylindrical shaft is fixed at the center of the reactor. These reactors normally struggle with inefficiently mixing the solution because mechanical stirring promotes heat transfer and reduces the retention of reagents. Different reactors have been developed to improve mixing in both batch and continuous mode of operation. The common stirrer reactors used in biodiesel production employ turbine and impeller stirrers. A new method to develop a monolithic stirrer has also been adopted to improve mixing in the reaction phase between alcohols and oil. New designs are key to achieving maximum yield efficiency by keeping the production cost as low as possible [143,144]. In recent times, reactors have been designed to achieve high shear mixing conditions between alcohol and oil based on the theoretical advancement in system design. The working principle is based on micro-mixing by rotating the inner tube in a fixed tube (spinning tube in tube) to generate a quick and efficient mixing process, as shown in Fig. 7 . The stationary cylinder with a narrow opening provides a pathway for reactants to enter the small spaces, and the inner tube rotation provides a high rate of shear mixing between both liquid surfaces to reduce the barrier between the interfacial reaction of oil and alcohol, leading to an increase in reaction rate [145,146]. The reactor has already been developed for industrial-scale production and adopted by some companies. The process has reduced the capital cost and provided better recovery and low wastewater production in the purification process. The simplest reactor designed for chemical reaction is usually a tubular or plug flow reactor (packed bed or trickle bed type), which can achieve transesterification and esterification reaction in biodiesel production. The mixing in plug flow reactors is mainly achieved by changing the reactor surface and adjusting flow pressure based on reaction time. The static mixture uses the flow energy to impose efficient mixing to save energy and reduce the operating cost [147,148]."
10,Micro reactor,"3.2 Micro reactor The microreactor uses a series of narrow channels with a minimum diameter to achieve a high surface-to-volume ratio for efficient heat and mass transfer. The two phases are mixed in a mixer and then stagnated to form small droplets to enhance the phase boundaries of liquids for interfacial reaction to achieve high mixing conditions [149]. It is complicated to interpret the multiphase reactor with different flow patterns to follow a controlled mass transfer that can affect the chemical reactions. The surface to volume ratio of the liquid phases and liquids flow rate can form different dispersion patterns in microchannels. Sun et al. [150] studied the flow pattern of methanol and oil in the microchannel to observe the high interfacial forces between both liquid phases. Guan et al. [151] studied the influence of liquid temperature and its effect in interfacial interaction between alcohol and oil phases. The flow pattern was studied under changing temperature conditions to observe biodiesel production yield under different flow patterns. In the meantime, the oil to alcohol molar ratio was also researched in detail. At lower methanol to oil molar ratios, methanol droplets were smaller and dispersed into the oil segment, which changed the molar ratio, allowing different flow patterns to be adopted along the process. One of the major concerns in microflow reactors is the separation of the glycerol layer at the end of the reaction, as both liquids do not form a homogenous mixture. An extended system is required to separate the glycerol layer in batch mode. However, Sun et al. [150] has successfully performed transesterification of oil in microreactors in the presence of alcohol and catalyst and achieved complete phase separation. Due to many limitations, the technique was impossible to be applied at industrial-scale production. Increasing the number of reactors connected in parallel may possibly integrate large scale microreactor structures without disturbing the designed fluidic properties for each microreactor, which may enable microreactors to be adopted at industrial scale biodiesel production [152]. Kashid and his group at EPFL (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne) in 2010 successfully adopted the process of multiple microreactors using capillary microstructure reactors, as shown in Fig. 8 [153]. The two liquids mix in the mixing area and the mixture is dispersed through multiple microchannels. In this case, only two pumps and one mixing element are used, reducing the costs for pumps and the mixing components. The distribution of the two-phase mixture is more complicated as all channels are required to maintain equal pressure. Although the external design can provide a single reactor and increase the capacity, the multiple independent reaction systems may limit the purpose of the approach."
11,Membrane reactor,"3.3 Membrane reactor Membrane reactors give a novel approach where transesterification of oils and purification of the glycerol layer are achieved simultaneously without needing water or other purifying techniques. Membrane reactors can adopt new catalysts, allowing more efficient transesterification reaction and reducing reaction time, and achieve reactions at a higher yield with high selectivity and less waste byproducts produced [154–156]. They also block unreacted oil from contaminating the final biodiesel product, thus producing high-quality biodiesel [157]. The ability of membrane reactors to reduce glycerol at an early stage from crude biodiesel has been studied using various kinds of membrane material and structure. Dube et al. [158] introduced the first membrane reactor successfully used in the production and purification of biodiesel. Since then, membranes have been reported in the literature that can reduce glycerol by 90–99% from crude biodiesel [159,160]. Based on the catalyst used, membranes can be classified into two types, i.e., the membrane that does or does not incorporate the catalyst. In non-contact membranes, the catalyst is mixed with oil and alcohol solution, mainly for homogeneous base catalysts. In the incorporated membrane, the heterogeneous catalyst is incorporated on the active surface of the membrane, and this membrane drives a combined reaction of transesterification and purification in a single step [161]. In terms of membrane material, inorganic membranes, compared to organic membranes, have been extensively studied in biodiesel purification, and its ability to be chemically inert with unique surface properties makes it a much better option to be implemented in harsh industrial operating conditions, such as high temperature, potential microbial contamination, and organic solvents. However, high capital investment and maintenance costs of inorganic membranes because of low selectivity present challenges for implementation at an industrial scale [162–164]. A comparative study between conventional methods and membrane-based biodiesel production systems [165] found that membrane purification was able to reduce losses by 50% compared to conventional water, acid, and solvent extraction techniques. It was also found that hydrophobic membranes were much more successful in achieving high purification compared to hydrophilic membranes. A simple lab-scale membrane reactor for biodiesel production is shown in Fig. 9 . A recent study tested the performance of a fixed-bed membrane reactor in the process of transesterification of triglycerides [166]. The ceramic membrane with micropores impregnated with TiO2/Al2O3 coated CaO on the surface acted as a catalyst. The biodiesel produced passed through a ceramic membrane with a pore size of 0.02 μm and purified to retain unreacted oil and free glycerol at a pressure of 100 kPa. At the temperature of 65 °C for 150 min, the molar ratio of methanol to oil 6:1 gave the best FAME yield of 94%. The production of biodiesel by membrane reactors can overcome the problems of conventional reactors; however, the use of membrane reactors also presents challenges that need to be resolved [166]. The production yield of biodiesel in the membrane reactor depends on oil to alcohol molar ratio, catalyst concentration, temperature, flow rate, membrane pore size, and membrane transmission pressure [166]. In general, similar to the conventional reactors, increasing the temperature and molar ratio of alcohol would increase the conversion rate in all types of membranes. Much research has been conducted on optimizing membrane reactors to improve mass transfer rates and achieve high conversion [167–169]. One of the significant issues in the industrial-scale application of membrane reactor is membrane fouling, which is caused by the formation of accumulated solutes and waste on the membrane's active surface, reducing the selectivity and product yield in the long run. There is a need to identify factors involved in membrane fouling and develop low-cost cleaning and manufacturing technologies for membrane-based reactors for biodiesel production."
12,Reactive distillation reactor,"3.4 Reactive distillation reactor In certain systems where chemical equilibrium and phase conditions coincide, reactive distillation (RD) is a very effective technique to achieve chemical reaction and separate reaction products simultaneously [170,171]. The reaction and distillation occur in the same area of the distillation column, and the product must be separated from the reactant by distillation, meaning that the product must be varying in weight. A schematic of the continuous flow reactive distillation reactor is shown in Fig. 10 . All primary alcohols have been experimented with to produce alkyl esters by reactive distillation using different reactive distillation reactors [172–175]. He et al. [176,177] developed a continuous flow reactive distillation reactor to produce biodiesel from canola oil and methanol. The process was optimized using both experimental and statistical methods. The primary aim was to develop a distillation reactor to reduce fresh methanol consumption in each experimental run and keep recycled methanol to maintain a higher methanol to glyceride ratio for better distillation. About 25% less methanol was used compared to conventional rectors with a 93% conversion rate achieved [176,177]. In another study, a three-phase reactive distillation system was developed to simultaneously achieve transesterification, esterification, and glycerol separation [178]. The column-based reactor with a reactive dividing wall was reported to successfully produce biodiesel from methanol and fatty acids [179]. Reactive distillation is still an active research field that mainly focuses on process control and operating conditions [180]. Improving the efficiency of heat exchange and thermal coupling can improve the system's ability to recover energy and improve sustainability. The integrated system can reduce heating and cooling requirements by 43% and 47%, respectively [181]. Table 2 presents a summary of the recent developments in all major biodiesel production reactors."
13,Advanced biodiesel production processes,"In conventional biodiesel production, the thermal energy is provided through heating reactants to a specific temperature to activate chemical reactions. However, in the most recent technologies, the required activation energy is reduced or achieved through electric power and other sources. This section discussed the most recent developments of alternative technologies adopted in the biodiesel production process."
14,Ultrasonic radiation,"4.1 Ultrasonic radiation In biodiesel production, two primary reactions involved are the esterification of FFAs to FAAEs and transesterification of triglycerides to FAAEs [70]. The purpose of ultrasonic chemical radiation is to increase catalyst surface activation by homogenizing the reactants and catalysts to provide more microchannels for emulsifying with reactants, thus enhancing the reaction rate. Using an ultrasonic assistant in homogenous transesterification, the most used process to produce biodiesel, does not affect the reaction thermodynamic equilibrium but enhances mass transfer, thus the reaction rate, to achieve the same chemical reaction at the minimal time [213,214]. This reaction process relies on the flow and acoustic energy provided by sonochemical radiations due to the passage of sound waves. The reaction mechanism of sound waves involves sinusoidal waves that provide both positive and negative pressure to generate cavitation bubbles and release energy [215–217]. In biofuel production, ultrasonic radiation has a far-reaching impact on chemical reaction processes to enhance the reaction rate. To utilize the ultrasonic radiation process more effectively, it is very important to understand the energy intensity and cavitation bubbles generation to establish an optimized system that provides uniform distribution of the ultrasonic energy and the cavitation effects. In ultrasonic radiation, electric energy is transferred into mechanical energy via piezoelectric transducers, which is then transferred into the chemical transformation [218–220]. It is important to optimize reactor design to reduce all these energy-transfer steps to minimize energy losses. A simple setup of a batch scale ultrasonic chemical reactor is shown in Fig. 11 . The sonochemical based reactor process improves transesterification reaction efficiency by requiring less oil to alcohol molar ratio and catalyst concentration with a shorter reaction time. One major contributor in the sonochemical reactor is the ultrasound to enhance reactants' emulsification normally conducted by mechanical stirring or a magnetic stirrer in conventional biodiesel reactors. The most recent developments in the ultrasonic chemical reaction process in treating different fatty acids and low-fat fats are shown in Table 3 . The most important part of esterification of fats is constantly removing water from the reaction phase to avoid reduction in reaction rate, and the high-intensity ultrasonic waves with a catalyst can improve the process. In homogenous catalyst assisted transesterification, ultrasound does not directly affect the thermodynamic equilibrium of reaction; however, it intensifies the mass transfer rate by accelerating the reaction kinetics to complete the same chemical reaction with up to 80% time reduction [218]. The temperature required to initiate the reaction is also greatly reduced by the input energy of ultrasonic cavitation, thus reducing temperature requirement in chemical reaction kinetics. By increasing the ultrasonic frequency, radiation energy increases, directly affecting the reactants emulsification, and intensifies the mass transfer rate to attain reaction equilibrium at a much quicker pace. However, in order to optimize frequency, it is needed to understand the energy economics of the reaction system. By combining ultrasonic energy input with other reaction processes, the transesterification and esterification reactions can be substantially improved for producing high-quality biodiesel at a low cost and in a much shorter time."
15,Microwave,"4.2 Microwave Since the beginning of biodiesel production, most methods and new reactors are designed based on conventional heat transfer, which thermodynamically transfers energy on the surface of the material. The main problem with the thermodynamic reaction process is the large amount of input energy required to initiate the chemical reaction. On the other hand, microwave systems can transfer energy directly at the molecule level, allowing early chemical reaction initiation and reducing time and energy consumption during the chemical reaction process [233]. The difference in energy transfer pathways between conventional and microwave heating is shown in Fig. 12 . In conventional thermal heating, the heat transfer at high temperature takes place on the surface of reactants and slowly goes into the molecule to activate reaction; however, in microwave through electric energy, electromagnetic waves are generated, which transfer energy directly at the molecular level, allowing early chemical reaction activity and better energy transfer [234]. In microwave reaction systems, the energy is transferred directly by forming supercharged molecular vibrations and rotations, allowing enough activation energy to initiate chemical reactions. Since microwave provides direct energy at the molecular level, the process is much more effective compared to thermal heating reactions. However, the ability of energy transfer also depends on the dissipation factor of the reactants. It is very important to identify the specific factor of the reactant materials to absorb electromagnetic waves and provide enough kinetic energy to activate chemical reactions [236,237]. To that end, heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts are used with microwave radiations to enhance energy transfer and provide control and selective energy to increase the production efficiency. Conventionally, transesterification is a chemical reaction to transfer triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters by reacting with alcohol in the presence of a catalyst and heat energy. The reaction is slow in a thermal heating environment and depends on the reaction equilibrium. Since microwave radiations transfer energy directly to the molecule, the high input power can directly degrade oils into different byproducts. Thus, controlling the radiation level is vital to achieve complete transesterification reactions. The catalyst in microwave radiation reduces microwave power usage while keeping the reaction equilibrium and achieving transesterification at very low input power with a very fast conversion rate. The input power has a direct effect on the electromagnetic radiation generated in the microwave system. In waste cooking oil to biodiesel conversion, the conversion rate increased with increasing input power up to 500 W. However, continuing to increase power up to 700 W was observed to reduce the production rate, meaning that at high power input, the microwave radiation affected the alcohol involved in the chemical reaction, causing a lower production rate. The best conditions for input power depend on the oil's properties and fatty acids present in triglycerides. Other effects such as reaction time, molar ratio, stirring speed, and other parameters have also been discussed to optimize the microwave transesterification reaction process [238,239]. Much research has focused on developing microwave radiation-based reactors to accelerate transesterification reaction for biodiesel production, mostly using batch type laboratory-scale reactors. Continuous-flow, microwave-radiation-based biodiesel production reactors have also been developed in recent times. A simple schematic of a batch type microwave radiation biodiesel reactor is shown in Fig. 13 , with the recent development in microwave reactors listed in Table 4 . In summary, microwave-radiation-based biodiesel production is considered one of the most promising technologies to be adopted at industrial-scale production for fast and continuous production of biodiesel. However, various hurdles (low-quality product and high production cost) in developing industrial-scale microwave-assisted biodiesel reactors remain. To date, the research information available appears to suggest that using hybrid methods involving conventional heating and ultrasonic radiation with microwave may overcome these problems."
16,Plasma discharge,"4.3 Plasma discharge Plasma is an ionized gas consisting of electrons, positive and negative ions, and neutral species, as termed by Irving Langmuir in 1932 [254]. The plasma generated can be described into two forms based on temperature and ions, cold (non-thermal) and thermal plasma. The hot plasma or thermal plasma is generated when temperature equilibrium is achieved between electrons and ions. This is normally achieved by applying heat, microwave, or electricity at a very high temperature (above 3500 °C), forming the ionic phase where both electrons and ions have the same temperature [255]. However, thermal plasma cannot be used in the degradation of most substances mainly because high temperature can rapidly decompose even the most stable bonds in reactants, making it impossible to control product with unstable bonding. Recently, liquid phase plasma discharge was introduced to induce high voltage electric discharge in the liquid solution using a channel between the two electrodes [256]. Since then, this process has been used in nanomaterial synthesis and many other organic solution degradation, including triglycerides pyrolysis by pulsing power supply into the solution [257]. The energy input can be controlled to precisely degrade any hydrocarbon and organic matters in solution using direct and high input power to pyrolyze triglycerides by plasma discharge via the reaction mechanism proposed by Meeprasertsagool [257]. The reaction starts with the plasma generation in the solution phase, leading to temperature increase and direct bond breakdown in triglyceride structure into diglycerides and monoglycerides. The reaction continues further into the degradation of monoglycerides into small unstable excited molecules and radicals. The process reforms into fuel products as radicals and molecules stabilize and form a new product [257]. Different types of plasma processes have been used in cracking oil in the fuel industry; however, catalytic or catalyst assisted chemical conversion of oils has not been studied in detail. In most research, plasma was mainly used as a catalyst to attain specific reactions from long-chain hydrocarbons catalysis [258]. With efficient non-thermal plasma reactors and technologies developed, catalytic cracking of oils has also attracted growing attention [259,260]. Researchers have proposed many kinds of reactors for advanced plasma cracking, including non-catalytic plasma reactors and hybrid catalytic plasma reactors. In non-catalytic plasma reactors, no external heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts are used for oil and hydrocarbon catalysis. The cracking process is mainly achieved through high energy electrons and ionization species generated by the electrons in the solution. Gliding arc and rotating gliding arc reactors have been successfully tested for oil cracking in non-catalytic plasma reactors [257,261,262]. The reaction mechanism of non-catalytic plasma reaction in treating triglycerides and alcohols was discussed by Harris [263]. The non-thermal plasma induced reaction through three major players, electrons, ions, and radicals. Since the production of these substances depends on the electric field applied, the overall reaction largely relies on the electric field generated by controlling voltages, gas pressure, and power input. However, in hybrid reactors, the plasma is loaded with a catalyst to achieve the required chemical reaction at low cost and low energy consumption. The presence of catalyst contributes to lowering the energy required to attain chemical reaction activity, which helps achieve high chemical reaction at low input energy with the synergistic effects of both plasma and catalyst. In a hybrid system, reactions start with surface reaction, and the activation energy can be controlled by input catalyst, which helps distribute electrons to enhance the plasma excitation process to generate more reactive species that stay in the active mode for a longer time with catalyst activity. The interaction between these electrons and reactive species generated and catalyst forms very complex reaction phenomena, which makes it very difficult to understand or develop the reaction pathway in these chemical reactions. Nonetheless, the effects of the hybrid systems and the analysis of byproducts are conducive to better understanding the catalyst-assisted, hybrid plasma reaction [264]. The catalyst has a very important role in hybrid plasma reactors to achieve high reaction efficiency. The catalyst helps keep the reaction in the forward direction by controlling the reaction mechanics when highly active species generate enough chemical bonding and release energy required for reaction activation [265]. Catalyst helps increase the selectivity of reaction and reduces the time required, which is an important factor in achieving the high performance of plasma reactors [266]. Table 5 summarizes catalytic and non-catalytic plasma reactions for biodiesel production. It seems that the biodiesel yield achieved is much higher with the catalyst-assisted plasma process than without. Fig. 14 shows two different kinds of plasma discharge reactors adopted for biodiesel production. The second most important factor in controlling a hybrid plasma reactor is the applied voltage, which directly influences the plasma generated in the solution mixture. Increasing applied voltage enhances the availability of electrons in a reaction, which helps generate more ions and radicals to attain more reactive species and increase the electron density to provide the energy available for electrons to achieve better surface interaction [267]. The increase of electrons and reactive species helps form more collision between oil molecules, causing better reaction initiation and bonds breaking. The increase in input power or applied voltage directly increases the ability of electrons, increases restive species to have better initiation, and forms more chemical reactions. In summary, plasma technology has great potential to be adopted for catalytic processing of hydrocarbons on a large scale because it provides a different form of energy compared to thermal to achieve chemical reactions. With more research, especially with the hybrid plasma technology development, all kinds of chemical reactions can be achieved using plasma discharge in a much more controlled environment. Plasma greatly affects catalyst efficiency, allowing a much better life for catalysts with minimum coke deposition and catalyst deactivation. More research needs to be focused on optimizing the plasma reaction system to achieve chemical conversion at low input cost to compete with thermal heating reactions. Also, the complex reaction and synergistic effects of hybrid plasma need to be understood before further process development."
17,Supercritical,"4.4 Supercritical Supercritical transesterification (SCT) is a promising alternative technique to conventional processes to produce biodiesel. SCT offers a catalyst-free process with faster reaction times, allowing for direct triglyceride transesterification and FFA esterification with a final product of higher purity. Moreover, this catalyst-free reaction provides improved phase solubility and low mass-transfer limitations [278–280]. In the SCT process, the feedstock and alcohol are fed into a reactor in which they are subjected to temperatures and pressures beyond the critical point of alcohol (for example, methanol: Tc = 240 °C and Pc = 1140 psi). Under these conditions, the thermo-physical properties of alcohol change such as diffusivity, density, viscosity, and polarity. Fig. 15 illustrates the phase diagram of the supercritical region. At high temperature and pressure, fluid (alcohol) enters a supercritical region, in which the fluid has both gas and liquid-like properties and exhibits a non-condensable fluid with a density between a gas and a liquid state. Besides, the fluid possesses decreased viscosity and increased mass diffusivity, allowing a greater mass transfer characteristic. The dielectric constant decreases in this state, reducing the polarity of insolvent and converting it into a non-polar solvent, which is better dissolved in alcohol under supercritical conditions to form a homogeneous phase. The main parameters influencing the supercritical transesterification are temperature, pressure, solvent-to-oil molar ratio, and reaction time. The supercritical production of biodiesel was first reported by Lee and Saka [281] and they concluded that the thermal decomposition of FAME might occur due to the high temperatures used, thus resulting in low-quality biodiesel. In a subsequent study reported by Kusdiana and Saka [282], the reaction mechanism between triglycerides and methanol under supercritical conditions was proposed. At high temperature and pressure in the supercritical process, methanol can be a free monomer due to decreased hydrogen bonding. The methanol molecule then directly attacks the carbonyl atom of the triglyceride, resulting in the transfer of a methoxide, by which biodiesel (methyl ester) and diglyceride are produced. Similarly, diglyceride is transesterified to form biodiesel and monoglyceride, which is further converted to biodiesel and glycerol. Yin et al. [283] reported biodiesel production from soybean oil using supercritical methanol in a high-pressure vessel of 250 cm3. The conversion rate was 95% in 10 min at a high temperature of 350 °C, whereas at 260 °C, there was only 30% conversion after 60 min. Han et al. [284] detected a complete ester conversion at a lowered reaction temperature of 280 °C using CO2 as a co-solvent at a 0.1 M ratio. Santana et al. [285] achieved a continuous production of biodiesel from vegetable oil using supercritical ethanol with CO2 as a co-solvent. They used sunflower-based oil in the supercritical ethanolysis in a continuous mode, fixed bed titanium reactor, and the yield was 80% in 4 min of reaction time at 200 °C and 200 bar at an ethanol-to-oil molar ratio of 25. In another study reported by Demirbas [285,286], transesterification of waste cooking oil with supercritical methanol in a 100 mL autoclave reactor achieved 99% yield in 30 min at 266 °C and an methanol to oil (M:O) molar ratio of 41:1. Tsai et al. [287] reported that waste cooking oil showed better efficiency than refined cooking oil in supercritical methanol transesterification. The biodiesel yield was 65% in 4 min at 300 °C and 100 bar. A recent study by Aboelazayem et al. [288] investigated and optimized biodiesel production with supercritical methanol without catalyst using response surface methodology. The result showed that the optimum biodiesel yield was 91% in 14.8 min at 253.5 °C and 198.5 bar in the 37:1 M:O molar ratio. Kinetic data used to simulate the reactor on Aspen HYSYS showed a 0.2% relative error from the experimental results. Moreover, animal fats and microalgae are also used as sustainable feedstock for supercritical transesterification. A flowchart of a simple supercritical reaction process is shown in Fig. 16 . Although SCT has many benefits in biodiesel production, such as no pre-treatment, soap, and catalyst removal, its main limitation rests with the high operation costs due to extreme temperatures and pressures required [290]. Nonetheless, many simulation, environmental assessment, and economic studies showed that supercritical technologies had better capital investment, technical benefits, and high biodiesel production efficiency with faster reaction times than other conventional technologies [291]. Given the higher production rate of biodiesel and other raw materials costs, this technology could be cost-effective at the commercial level. Moreover, the operation efficiency can be further improved by following energy-saving steps such as using the self-heat recuperation technology. Table 6 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of biodiesel production technologies and basic reaction parameters in each production process."
18,Conclusion,"The results of this comprehensive review on the technical advancement achieved to date of producing biodiesel can be summarized in the following. First, feedstock selection is one of the major factors that relates most to the economics in introducing biodiesel as a mainstream transportation fuel. To that end, the 3rd and 4th generation feedstock are preferred in biodiesel production at a commercial scale. Second, there are different physicochemical reaction pathways to produce biodiesel from triglycerides and fats, among which the physical methods by adding esters to vegetable oil only produce a low calorific fuel with very low efficiency, thus having limited practical applicability. Instead, chemical methods employing transesterification reaction have shown to be the most effective pathway for biodiesel production using both catalytic and non-catalytic reaction processes. Third, catalysts play a key role in driving the transesterification reaction, and both homogeneous and heterogeneous acid and base catalysts could achieve at least 90% conversion in biodiesel yield. While for enzymatic catalysts, the yield varies widely from around 70% to 99%, depending upon the feedstock type. Fourth, both batch and continuous flow reactors assisted by catalysts and alcohols could achieve conversion yields by at least 89%. Fifth, although various emerging technologies for biodiesel production have been under investigation in recent years, including plasma, microwave, and supercritical and ultrasonic radiation, along with the design process in the membrane, microchannel, and reactive distillation reactors, none of them have reached application status. That said, among the emerging technologies, the liquid-phase plasma discharge method (LPPD) was found to be most promising, reaching 99.5% yield in converting soybean oil to biodiesel in the shortest reaction time (seconds). As such, more research efforts should be directed to this field to develop the LPPD technology into a new generation of commercial-scale technologies for biodiesel synthesis. In addition, since there is lack of information in understanding the reaction mechanisms in the plasma discharge process in inducing transesterification and esterification, further research in this field is required to better understand the influential parameters involved in the reaction process with optimization to achieve chemical conversion at low input cost to compete with thermal heating reactions. Finally, given the many traditional and recently developed processes reviewed in this paper, new reactors and processes are still needed based on the feedstock characteristics to achieve the highest net energy efficiency and produce high-quality fuel for transportation. As the interest in advanced reactor technologies for biodiesel production is growing, this comprehensive review of all the available technologies for biodiesel synthesis along with their reaction mechanisms has laid the groundwork for the readers to advance ideas from existing technologies to develop new, better, and economically sustainable biodiesel production pathways. With the collective efforts from researchers around the world, it is believed that the fossil fuel-based diesel will be replaced by the biodiesel produced from renewable resources in the near future."
