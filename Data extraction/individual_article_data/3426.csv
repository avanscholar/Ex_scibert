0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean energy vector, which produces neither CO x nor NO x when used as a fuel, offering an important reduction in the emissions of these pollutants. Besides that, it possesses a higher efficiency to convert chemical to electrical energy when used in fuel cell systems [1,2]. Because of that new technologies for hydrogen production are intensively investigated in order to face the growing demand which could be derived. Catalytic reforming of bioethanol is one of the most attractive processes for hydrogen production because of increasing availability of the alcohol by fermentation of different kind of biomass. By this way, the greenhouse effect would be minimized because the CO2 produced in the reforming process is totally recycled during the growth of plants [3,4]. Ethanol steam reforming overall process (1) is a complex set of elementary steps that involve several organic intermediates and where many reaction pathways are possible, depending on the catalyst and reaction conditions [5]: (1) CH3CH2OH+3H2O→2CO2 +6H2 The main reaction mechanism comprises dehydrogenation or dehydration routes. Dehydrogenation reaction produces acetaldehyde as intermediate product (2), which can further undergo decarbonylation to give methane and carbon monoxide (3). Methane can go through steam reforming reactions generating hydrogen and carbon monoxide (4). (2) CH3CH2OH→CH3CHO+H2 (3) CH3CHO→CH4 +CO (4) CH4 +H2O→CO+3H2 Reforming catalysts must satisfy several conditions in order to be effectively used at industrial scale: (i) high selectivity towards the desired product; (ii) high resistance to carbon formation which reduces the amount of active centers and deactivation. Numerous works are devoted to study reforming catalysts based on noble metals (Pt, Rh) [6–9], and transition metals such as cobalt [10–12] and nickel [13–16]. These works usually suggest that the best catalyst are those containing cobalt and/or nickel because of their low price and availability, although the addition of small amounts of noble metals could also be considered because of the marked improvement of their catalytic properties (higher activity, lower carbon formation). The support can also improve the catalytic properties through the interactions with the metal active phase and with reactants and intermediate species. Both redox and acid-base properties appears to be the main parameters to be considered [17]. In previous studies, trimetallic NiLaZr oxides have shown to be very active catalysts for the steam reforming of bioethanol [18]. Both, those prepared by nickel impregnation of the LaZr mixed oxide and by simultaneous coprecipitation of the three metals, gave place to materials characterized by the formation of NiO and a La2Zr2O7 pyrochlore type compound at calcination temperatures higher than 780°C. In the case of the coprecipitated series a higher catalytic stability was observed and ascribed to higher dispersion of Ni in the trimetallic system. Trimetallic oxides with Co in replacement of Ni has also displayed a good performance in the reforming of bioethanol [19]. In this work, a comparative study of NiLaZr and CoLaZr trimetallic oxides as catalysts for the steam reforming of ethanol is performed. The influence of Rh addition to the trimetallic system is also studied as a way to improve their catalytic properties. The effect of CO2 addition on the reacting system is explored to detect differences in the behavior of both types of catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Mixed oxides were prepared by a sol–gel method based on the thermal decomposition of the metallic propionates. Lanthanum(III) acetate, zirconium(IV) acetylacetonate, cobalt(II) acetate, nickel(II) acetate and rhodium(II) acetate were used as starting materials for the synthesis. A known amount of each metal salt was previously dissolved in propionic acid to a 0.12M solution. The different solutions were heated near their boiling temperatures, mixed and kept under boiling conditions with continuous solvent removal by evaporation. The resulting solid resin was calcined in flowing air at 500°C for 6h using a ramp rate of 2°Cmin−1. Then, calcination at 700°C, 850°C and 950°C for 2h using a ramp rate of 10°Cmin−1 was performed. The theoretical mass weight composition of the trimetallic MeLaZr systems (Me: Ni and Co) is the following: Ni, Co: 6.6%, La: 49.0%, Zr: 44.4% while the RhMeLaZr contains 5.6% in weight of Ni, 1% of Rh and the same percent La: 49.0%, Zr: 44.4%."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization The mixed oxides structure was studied by X-ray diffraction in a Brucker AXS-D8 Advanced equipment, Cu Kα radiation, in an interval from 2θ =10° to 2θ =90°. Catalyst reducibility was studied by thermal programmed reduction (TPR). The mass of catalyst was 0.05g and a H2–Ar gaseous mixture (3.85% molar in H2) at a total flow of 50mLmin−1 was used. The temperature was increased at a ramp rate of 15°Cmin−1 until 900°C. Catalyst micro-homogeneity was characterized by TEM-EDXS analysis with a TOPCON EM-002B equipment (voltage acceleration of 200kV). 200nm probes were used for the global elemental analysis (G) and 14.4nm for the elemental analysis at different regions of the samples. The BET surface areas of the samples were measured on a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 equipment by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms determined at −196°C. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of used catalysts were performed in a Shimadzu TG-50 equipment in air flow gas of 50mlmin−1 with a ramp rate of 5°Cmin−1 until 900°C. FT-IR characterization was performed with a Bomem Hartmann & Braun MB-Series."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests They were performed in a flow system with a fixed-bed tubular reactor operating at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (0.10g) was first subjected to in situ reduction under pure hydrogen flow (20mLmin−1) at 650°C for 1h. Following reduction, hydrogen was replaced by argon (20mLmin−1) to eliminate hydrogen from the reactant system. Finally, the ethanol–water mixture (1:6 molar ratio) (gas flow of 13mLmin−1) was added to argon entering the reactor. In all experiments the gas space velocity (GHSV) was 27,000h−1 referred to normal conditions of pressure and temperature. CO2 (0.04mLmin−1) was added to the reactant gas mixture during the time interval between 180min and 300min for each experiment. Reaction products were analyzed on-line by gas chromatography with a Perichrom 2363 apparatus equipped with a Hayesep Q column and a Varian 3400 apparatus with a molecular sieve 5A column. Both flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors were used. The theoretical composition of the gaseous products under equilibrium conditions was calculated by the non-stoichiometric method of Gibbs free energies (ProSim Plus) at the same reaction conditions."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization X-ray diffraction patterns in Figs. 1 and 2 confirm the highly amorphous structure of the solids obtained by calcination at 700°C and the appearance of the La2Zr2O7 compound together with NiO and Co3O4 at higher calcinations temperatures. Thus, the formation of the biphasic system (MeLaZr→MeO x +La2Zr2O7) took place for both initial amorphous structure as it was already observed in previous works for other NiLaZr and CuLaZr catalysts [18,20]. For catalysts calcined at 700°C, an incipient formation of the La2Zr2O7 phase is clearly observed on the CoLaZr catalyst while the incipient segregation of the NiO phase is observed in the NiLaZr catalyst before formation of the La2Zr2O7 phase. These results suggest a higher degree of interaction of Co (with respect to Ni) dispersed in the amorphous trimetallic oxide structure before segregation as Co3O4 by calcination at higher temperature. Energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis of fresh catalysts, shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , revealed global contents of the three metals (G) close to the theoretical value (Ni, Co: 6.6%, La: 49.0%, Zr: 44.4%). Local contents in the NiLaZr (Fig. 3, results from 1 to 12) were in the following ranges: Ni: 0.2–17.2%, La: 45.9–70.1%; Zr: 41.6–17.6%. For the CoLaZr catalyst local contents were Co: 5.8–9.3%, La: 57.1–62.2%; Zr: 30.8–35.2%, which reveals a higher microhomogeneity with respect to the NiLaZr catalyst. BET specific surface areas of the catalysts are shown in Table 1 . The highest specific surface areas were found in catalysts calcined at 500°C. The decrease in surface areas encountered for the catalysts calcined at higher temperatures may be attributed to sintering taking place under more severe thermal treatment conditions. Fig. 5 shows TPR profiles for the trimetallic systems calcined at 700°C. NiLaZr reduction gave place to three hydrogen consumption peaks that centered at 310°C may be ascribed to the reduction of surface exposed NiO not integrated into the amorphous mixed oxide matrix. Reduction of constituent Ni in the amorphous oxide takes place at higher temperatures as it is evidenced by the two large peaks at 500°C and 650°C. The presence of these two H2 consumption peaks reveals the presence of more than one type of NiO in the amorphous structure. Probably, an incipient phase segregation process takes place during the calcination at 700°C which determines the formation of NiO crystallites having a lower degree of interaction with the amorphous structure. The CoLaZr catalyst displays three hydrogen consumption peaks at 310°C, 370°C and 410°C which are ascribed to the reduction of surface exposed cobalt oxide. Similar reduction patterns are reported in the literature for cobalt oxide and are related with Co3+ to Co2+ and Co2+ to Co0 transitions [21]. The peak at 800°C is ascribed to Co in strong interaction with the matrix. All these results reveal that Ni can be more easily reduced than Co in these trimetallic systems probably due to a lower degree of interaction with the other two metal oxides. Addition of 1% of Rh promotes reducibility at lower temperatures for both trimetallic catalysts with the main H2 consumption peaks at 375°C for Ni and at 250°C for Co (see Fig. 6 )."
7,Catalytic tests,"3.2 Catalytic tests Total ethanol conversion was observed for NiLaZr and CoLaZr for the first 2h (see Fig. 7 ) with a molar distribution of the main products in the gas phase – H2, CO2, CO and CH4 – close to the thermodynamic values as shown in Table 2 . After 2h, ethanol conversion declines progressively and attains 61% and 65% for NiLaZr and CoLaZr, respectively after 10h of time on stream. The decay of ethanol conversion is not affected significantly by CO2 injection in the interval between 180 and 300min of time on stream. This is an expected result since CO2 is not directly involved in the elementary steps of the reaction mechanism where ethanol molecules react on the catalyst surface to yield acetaldehyde or ethylene by the dehydrogenation or the dehydration ways respectively. Recent studies on dry reforming of ethanol also support the occurrence of the same routes for ethanol reaction in the presence of CO2 [22]. A higher CO2 content in the gaseous mixture could affect indirectly by changes in the amount which is adsorbed on the catalyst surface. In this sense, the literature reports that under reforming reaction conditions with Ni/La2O3 catalysts, carbon dioxide reacts to form lanthanum oxycarbonate species La2O2CO3: La2O3 +CO2 ↔La2O2CO3 [17]. Differences in the surface structure of both catalysts as shown in XRD and TPR results could lead to different degree of CO2 fixation which could be related to the higher ethanol conversion observed with the NiLaZr catalyst during the time interval of CO2 injection. Catalysts deactivation is also observed through the decay of H2 selectivity in the gas products as shown in Fig. 8 . Deactivation processes, such as carbon and oxycarbonate formation, sintering, etc., affect catalytic sites where H2 is formed by the several elementary reactions involved in the whole reaction mechanism, mainly ethanol dehydrogenation, CH4 reforming (reaction 4) and the water gas shift reaction (WGSR): CO+H2O→CO2 +H2. Fig. 8 also shows the sudden drop in H2 molar selectivity after CO2 injection is started after 3h of time on stream and the further increase at the end of the CO2 addition intervall. These changes follow the same trend of those which are predicted from thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. From a kinetic point of view, the rate of the reverse WGSR (CO2 +H2 →H2O+CO) and/or that of methanation (CO2 +3H2 →CH4 +H2O) are favoured, thus lowering the H2 content of the gaseous mixture of products. The increase in the CO content (from 8.7% and 11.9% at 180min to 9.7% and 12.8% at 210min for NiLaZr and CoLaZr catalysts respectively) agrees well with the occurrence of the WGSR. It can also be observed that the CO2 injection affects more severely the H2 content with the CoLaZr catalyst attaining 28% at t =300min. This fact also suggests that CO2 addition could also affect differently processes leading to deactivation on both catalysts. Carbon and oxycarbonates species could be removed more efficiently on Ni catalyst by the Boudouard reaction – La2O2CO3 +C→La2O3 +2CO – thus preserving active sites for reaction paths leading to H2 formation. The selectivity of other reaction products is also differently affected on both catalysts. Fig. 9 shows the progressive increase of CH4 molar composition with respect to the thermodynamic value during the first 2h, which can be related with the rate decrease of the reaction: CH4 +H2O→H2 +CO2 and the resulting H2 selectivity decrease already shown in Fig. 8. The effect of the addition of CO2 is a sudden decrease of CH4 selectivity which can be ascribed to the contribution of the dry reforming of CH4 (CH4 +CO2 →2H2 +2CO) to the overall process. Indeed, a higher CO2 content would accelerate CH4 consumption thus leading to a lower selectivity in the gaseous mixture. The decrease of CH4 selectivity is also supported by thermodynamical calculations: 1.04% without addition of CO2 and 0.26% with addition of CO2 to the reactant gas mixture. The higher decrease of CH4 content during the CO2 injection time intervall with the NiLaZr catalyst reveals the higher activity of this catalyst for the dry reforming reaction. Increasing amounts of acetaldehyde with the time on stream were found on both catalysts, attaining 5% in the NiLaZr and 50% in the CoLaZr, at 10h of time on stream, which reveals its important role as intermediate in the reaction mechanism according to the decarbonylation reaction to give methane and carbon monoxide (reaction (3)). Here again, the higher amount observed in the CoLaZr shows the higher deactivation of this catalyst. Increasing amounts of ethylene are also present among reaction products, and after 10h it attains 8% in the NiLaZr catalyst and 3% in the CoLaZr. These results do not support ethylene as an intermediate species in the main reaction mechanism since the higher amount was found in the NiLaZr catalyst having the lower deactivation level. Probably, ethylene is formed as a side product whose formation is favoured by the NiLaZr catalyst in higher extent than the CoLaZr catalyst. 3.2.1 Effect of Rh promotion on catalytic performance Addition of Rh to the trimetallic catalyst leads to the total conversion of ethanol all along the 10h of reforming experiments. This promoting effect of Rh is also evidenced by H2 selectivity (70.9% and 71.1% for NiRhLaZr and CoRhLaZr, respectively) which is almost similar to the thermodynamic value (71.3%) during the first 3h as shown in Fig. 10 . The higher approximation to the thermodynamic values was also observed for the other gas product selectivity as shown in Table 3 . Little deactivation took place at higher times on stream which lead to final H2 selectivity of 67.5% and 60.6% for the NiRhLaZr and CoRhLaZr catalysts, respectively. The higher activity of Rh promoted catalysts is also observed by the much lower selectivity of acetaldehyde that was lower than 0.4% and 1.0% for the Ni and Co catalyst respectively. The amount of ethylene was also affected and the maximum amounts were 1.2% and 3.4% for Ni and Co catalyst, respectively. The promoting effect of Rh can be related to its ability for breaking the carbon–carbon bonds as reported in previous works [8,9,23,24]. Thus, ethanol as well as C2 intermediates would be transformed more efficiently. This promoting effect seems to be also valid for CH4 reforming either with H2O or with CO2, according to the lower selectivity shown in Table 3."
8,Postreaction characterization of catalysts,"3.3 Postreaction characterization of catalysts Thermogravimetric analysis for the NiLaZr catalyst after reaction at 650°C showed a weight gain of 1.3% between 350 and 600°C corresponding to the reoxidation of nickel (Fig. 11 ). Later, a gradual drop can be ascribed to oxidation of carbonaceous residues formed during the reaction. The CoLaZr catalyst shows several weight gains due to the reoxidation of cobalt in several steps (Fig. 11). In the first step, 1.2% increase in weight between 270 and 450°C corresponds to the oxidation of cobalt metal to cobalt oxide (II): Co→CoO. Then a second gain between 520 and 610°C and 715 and 830°C, respectively corresponds to the oxidation of cobalt oxide (+2) to cobalt oxide (+3): CoO→Co3O4. Thermal analysis for Rh-promoted catalysts showed differences with respect to the catalysts without noble metal addition (Fig. 12 ). In the case of NiRhLaZr, it showed a weight gain between 260 and 610°C corresponding to nickel reoxidation. Thus, rhodium promotes the oxidation of nickel at lower temperatures. No weight loss was observed between 610°C and 800°C, which indicates that a lower amount of carbonaceous residues was formed in this case. Above 800°C the gradual weight loss is ascribed to carbon residues that are in strong interaction with the amorphous structure. CoRhLaZr showed the same weight gain steps as CoLaZr catalyst (Fig. 11). However, the percentage weight gains were lower with respect to the unpromoted catalyst possibly due to an alloy between Co and Rh displaying higher oxidation resistance [25]. The FTIR analysis of the NiLaZr catalyst after reaction showed peaks corresponding to lanthanum oxycarbonate La2O2CO3 (Fig. 13 ). The absorbance peaks were: 898, 1164, 1456 and 1510cm−1. These peaks are located very close to the vibration bands of La2O2CO3: 880, 1063 and 1415cm−1 [20]. Complementary X-ray analysis of this catalysts did not show presence of La oxycarbonate probably because they exist only as surface species. The catalyst CoLaZr did not present the previous peaks (Fig. 13). This is due possibly to the incipient formation of La2Zr2O7 for the CoLaZr catalyst calcined at 700°C as seen in Fig. 2. Thus, the formation of the pyrochlore-type compound prevents the formation of oxycarbonate species. TEM analysis revealed the presence of amorphous carbon over the catalysts after reaction a 650°C (Fig. 14 ). The lower amount observed over those promoted with Rh agrees well with their higher activity as shown in catalytic tests. According to these results carbon formation explains the observed deactivation of catalysts at 650°C. Differences in deactivation rate can be ascribed to lanthanum oxycarbonates existing mainly in the amorphous structures which could participate in carbon gasification through the reaction La2O2CO3 +C→La2O3 +2CO. Other mechanisms leading to deactivation such as sintering cannot be discarded. Indeed, particle size determined from X-ray patterns reveal particle growth from 1.7 to 4.5nm and 5.9 to 6.8nm for the NiLaZr and CoLaZr, respectively. The lower size of NiLaZr particles could explain the lower deactivation rate by improving the resistance to carbon formation with respect to NiLaZr. We could not detect growth of Ni crystals into the trimetallic oxide particles which could determine a lower interaction with the other two metal oxides (La, Zr) depressing the rate of carbon gasification [24,26]. Finally, the chemical state of Co species should also be taken into account due to the easier oxidation of metallic Co nanoparticle which tends to cause deactivation as well."
9,Conclusions,"The method of preparation of the catalysts by pseudo sol–gel method, and mixed propionates decomposition, allows the synthesis of a trimetallic oxides MeLaZr with Me=cobalt, nickel. Calcination of the amorphous precursors leads to the formation of the La2Zr2O7 pyrochlore-type compound in coexistence with the Me-oxide. Ni and Co display several interaction degrees with the other two metals into the catalysts. The trimetallic oxides obtained at 700°C displayed high activity for the ethanol steam reforming and high selectivity to hydrogen formation. The addition of a small amount of rhodium remarkably improved catalysts reducibility as well as their activity and hydrogen selectivity. The injection of CO2 to the reactant gas showed to be a useful technique for the study of the reaction mechanism involving ethanol dehydrogenation as the first step and CH4 reforming both with H2O and CO2. Oxycarbonate species formed during the reforming tests play a key role on the control of surface deposits and the catalyst activity, mainly through the gasification of carbon deposits. Lower deactivation of the Ni based catalysts is related to the higher reducibility as well as the more efficient gasification of carbon deposits."
