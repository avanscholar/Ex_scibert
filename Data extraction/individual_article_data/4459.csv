0,Introduction,"With fossil fuel depletion and environmental pollution, the development of sustainable energy sources is urgently needed. Ethanol is favoured for its excellent features, such as renewability, safety and cleanliness. Clostridium thermocellum is an ideal strain for the production of cellulose ethanol due to both degrading cellulose and producing ethanol. It is one of the few microorganisms that can degrade untreated cellulose to produce ethanol. However, the direct cellulosic conversion to ethanol production is not efficient, which hinders the practical application of cellulose ethanol. Therefore, it is of great significance to increase ethanol production and cellulose utilization by C. thermocellum. The Lynd group has made many efforts to increase the ethanol yield of C. thermocellum. For example, a mutant strain of C. thermocellum AG553 was constructed, which increased the flux of ethanol by knocking out or reducing byproduct pathways. The results showed that ethanol production by AG553 was increased two to three times relative to the wild-type strain and that formate synthesis was effectively eliminated. Their study also found that the deletion of the nfnAB (NADP+ oxidoreductase) gene in C. thermocellum had little effect on the distribution of fermentation products. In contrast, deletion of the RNF (NAD+ oxidoreductase) gene led to a reduction in ethanol formation, and overexpression of the RNF gene significantly increased ethanol production [1,2]. Their study also found that Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum can use hemicellulose to efficiently produce ethanol. Recent research confirmed that the four genes involved in the production of ethanol by T. saccharolyticum are adhE, nfnA, nfnB and adhA. After these genes were inserted into C. thermocellum, the yield of ethanol was significantly increased [3]. This study also found that the absence of adhE genes in C. thermocellum and T. saccharolyticum reduced ethanol production by approximately 95%, which confirmed that adhE was necessary for the formation of ethanol in these microorganisms [4]. From the above examples, the strategies to improve ethanol production include knocking out the enzyme genes of acetic acid, lactic acid and hydrogen metabolic pathways and inserting key enzyme genes of other microbial ethanol synthesis pathways [1,5]. However, there have been few reports on the metabolic regulation pathways for ethanol production, although it has been found that key enzymes, such as alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase, play an important role in ethanol production [6]. The improvement in the activity of key enzymes may increase the production of ethanol. There are many methods to improve enzyme activity. For example, it has been shown that the normal metabolic activities and product synthesis of microorganisms require the participation of a moderate amount of metal ions [7–9]. Rare earth ions, as special metal ions, have been explored for their role in microbial metabolism, microbial growth and reproduction [10–13]. Their mechanism of action is mainly thought to affect many fields, such as rare earth ions, which can affect the activity of enzymes. La3+ was very similar to Ca2+ in physical and biochemical properties and structure, but it binds more easily to the receptor protein than Ca2+. Pickard et al. [14] confirmed for the first time that La3+ had the same function as Ca2+ and could participate in the regulation of enzyme activity and enzyme synthesis. This phenomenon has gradually been recognized by many scholars. Arjan et al. [15] found that rare earth ions such as La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+ and Nd3+ not only promoted the growth of Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV but also improved the activity of methanol dehydrogenase (MDH). Hibi Y [16] and Fitriyanto N A [17] also found that La3+, Ce3+ or Pr3+ could enhance the activity of MDH in M. radiotolerans and Bradyrhizobium. Sp. Based on their research, Nakagawa T [18,19] confirmed that La3+ can enhance the activity of MDH but cannot interfere with the normal expression of mutant bacteria. In addition, rare earth ions can deform the lipopolysaccharide structure of the cell wall of E. coli and cause the loss of intracellular contents [20]. Excessive rare earth ions could lead to the reduction or loss of activity of biological macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids [21]. Zhang et al. [22] found that Dy3+ and Nd3+ had mutagenesis effects on the amylase gene of Bacillus subtilis and improved amylase activity. Ochi [23] found that the silencing genes of enzymes of several Streptomyces strains were activated with rare earth ions. The interaction between rare earth ions and proteins or enzymes is taken as the starting point of the mechanism of rare earth ions. As a result, we used rare earth ions to improve the ethanol titer of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405, which is an excellent cellulose ethanol producer. This is the first study to use rare earth ions to improve ethanol production. The possible mechanism for the enhancement of ethanol biosynthesis is also elucidated. It can offer more choices for improving the production of ethanol."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Strains and medium,"2.1 Strains and medium C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 was a gift from Professor Lee Lynd of the United States. The medium was prepared in an anaerobic cabinet with an atmosphere of N2, and the medium composition is shown in Table 1 . All the chemicals used in the medium were of Merck grade. The experiments were performed in 100 mL serum bottles, each filled with 30 mL culture. Inoculum volume was 5% of total culture volume."
3,Effects of rare earth ions on C. thermocellum ATCC 27405,"2.2 Effects of rare earth ions on C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 With Avicel as the substrate, sterilized rare-earth solutions (LaCl3, CeCl3, NdCl3, GdCl3, SmCl3 and EuCl3) of 1 × 10−4 M, 1 × 10−5 M and 1 × 10−6 M were inoculated at 0 h and 12 h, respectively. After cultivation at 55 °C and 180 rpm for 48 h, the ethanol titer and cellulose degradation ratio were determined, and the ethanol conversion ratio was calculated. Cellobiose (5 g/L) as a substrate instead of Avicel was added to the roller tube and then cultured for 3 d with 5% seed. Well grooved rollers were picked, and then a small amount of liquid medium was added to try to wash the colony on the tube wall into the medium. All medium was changed to fresh medium and incubated at 55 °C until logarithmic phase. The strains were named as follows: C0: C. thermocellum ATCC 27405; C1: C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 with Nd3+ in the medium; C2: C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 of the sixth subcultivation after removal of Nd3+ in the medium. The Avicel and cellulose were insoluble in water, and the biomass was detected by protein concentration, which was measured with Coomassie blue staining and Bradford assay [24]."
4,Distribution of Nd3+ in cells,"2.3 Distribution of Nd3+ in cells The culture broth was separated by centrifugation for 10 min at 6000 rpm, and the cells were washed with deionized water and centrifuged again. The pellets were acidized with diluted hydrochloric acid and then centrifuged, and the acid supernatant and cells were collected. The cells were crushed by ultrasonic disruption for 30 min, and then cell lysate and cell debris were obtained after centrifugation for 20 min. The concentration of Nd3+ in the supernatant collected by each step was measured. The fermentation broth was incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 rpm. The cells were washed 3–4 times with sterile distilled water after each centrifugation, washed 2–3 times with 6 M KCl after each centrifugation and finally resuspended in 6 M KCl. The cell solution was hydrolysed with 50 μg/mL lysozyme at 55 °C for 60 min, and then protoplasts were obtained after centrifugation."
5,Effects of Nd3+ on cell mophology,"2.4 Effects of Nd3+ on cell mophology Three samples of C0, C1, and C2, which were cultured to the logarithmic phase, were centrifuged at high speed for 20 min. The cells were washed 3 times with sterile saline and then lysed with freeze thawing 5 times. Afterwards, the cells were resuspended with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.6). The cell solution was crushed in an ice-water bath with ultrasonication for 30 min under 100 W output power. The broken cells were centrifuged at low speed for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at high speed for 20 min. The pellets were washed with sterile saline several times. Crude cell walls (0.1 g) were resuspended in 5 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.6). The cell suspension was incubated at 55 °C for 1 h with 50 μL DNase. Crude cell walls (0.1 g) were digested by stirring at 55 °C for 2 h with 50 μL trypsin. The mixture was centrifuged at low speed for 15 min, and then the supernatant was centrifuged at high speed for 30 min to collect the pellets. The pellets were washed with sterilized distilled water several times, and the pure cell wall was collected by centrifugation [25]. The pure cell wall was dried to constant weight. The solid-state KBr compression method was used to test the infrared spectra of the cell walls of strains C0, C1 and C2 by FTIR (Nexus 670, USA). The fermentation broth was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the precipitate was washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) several times. The cells were fixed with a suitable concentration of glutaraldehyde solution at 4 °C overnight and then washed several times with phosphate buffer for 20 min each time. The cells were sequentially dehydrated by 50%, 75%, 95% and 100% ethanol for 20 min, and the dehydrated cells were freeze-dried. The surface of the fixed cells and the pure cell wall were sprayed with gold and scanned, and the morphology of the cells was observed under different magnifications by SEM (Hitachi S-4800, Japan)."
6,Effects of Nd3+ on the activity of key enzymes in the ethanol synthesis pathway,"2.5 Effects of Nd3+ on the activity of key enzymes in the ethanol synthesis pathway 2.5.1 Effects of Nd3+ on the activity of key enzymes There are four key enzymes in the ethanol synthesis pathway: ADH, ALDH, PFO and PFK. Twenty-five millilitres of fermentation broth was centrifuged (8000 rpm, 4 °C) for 10 min, and the precipitate was washed three times with 50 mL of 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). After high-speed centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min, 1.5 times the volume of the buffer was added to the cells, which were then disrupted in an ice bath with an ultrasonic cell disruptor for 30 min and centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was a crude enzyme solution, and the reaction system of key enzymes is shown in Table 2 . Initial reaction ratios were measured with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) at 578 nm methyl viologen [26], 340 nm for NAD(P)H [27], and 233 nm for acetyl-CoA[27], with the molar absorbance coefficients indicated. 2.5.2 Effects of Nd3+ on the expression of key enzyme genes Total RNA was extracted from fresh culture samples with the Bacteria Total RNA Isolation Kit (Sangon Biotech, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was determined by a nucleic acid ultramicroscope (Nano-200, China). Total DNA from C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions for gram-positive bacteria. An additional treatment using DNase-free RNase ONE (Sangon Biotech, China) was performed following DNA extraction. cDNA was synthesized by the M-MuLV First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Sangon Biotech, China). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using the Roche Light Cycler 480 Sequence Detection System with SYBR Green fluorescent dye. The primer sequences were designed by Primer 5.0 and are listed in Table 3 . Each reaction was set to a final volume of 20 μL. A master mix for each primer set was made using SYBR Green Master Mix (Sangon Biotech, China) as follows: 10 μL SYBR Green Master Mix (which contained all the nucleotides, polymerase, reaction buffer, and SYBR Green), 0.8 μL each of the forward and reverse primers (100 nM), 3.4 μL nuclease-free water, and 5 μL cDNA solution. The RT–PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min; 40 two-step cycles of 95 °C for 15 s (melting) and 59 °C for 60 s (combination annealing/extension). A relative standard curve method was used for RNA quantification, as defined by Applied Biosystems. For this study, the 16S rRNA gene was used as a calibrator. 2.5.3 Effects of Nd3+ on the sequence of key enzymes gene DNA was extracted with the Bacterial Genome Extraction Kit (Tiangen Biotech, China). DNA synthesis and sequencing were finished by Sangon Biotech (China). PCR was performed with a Mastercycler (Bio–Rad MyCycler, USA). Gene amplification was conducted using Premix Taq™ according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Takara). The primer sequences listed in Table 4 . Each reaction was set to a final volume of 20 μL as follows: 10 μL 5 × Premix Taq™, 1 μL forward primer, 1 μL reverse primer, and 2 μL genomic DNA. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s at the corresponding temperature, and elongation at 72 °C for the corresponding time; and 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were separated on agarose gels and retrieved with a Tiangen DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Tiangen Biotech, China)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effects of rare earth ions on ethanol titer and cellulose degradation ratio,"3.1 Effects of rare earth ions on ethanol titer and cellulose degradation ratio First, 10−4 M, 10−5 M and 10−6 M of La3+, Ce3+, Nd3+, Gd3+, Sm3+ and Eu3+ were added to the culture broth at the initiation culture time (0 h) (in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ) and cell growth stationary phase (12 h) (in Fig. 3 ) to improve ethanol productivity. Ethanol productivity was improved significantly when C. thermocellum was cocultured with Ce3+, Nd3+, Gd3+ and Eu3+. With microcrystalline cellulose as the substrate, when 10−6 M Nd3+ was added to the culture broth, the ethanol concentration reached 26.62%, which was 98.36% higher. The cellulose degradation ratio with the addition of light rare earth elements was not obviously increased. This phenomenon was similar to others. Then, 10−5 M Nd3+ and Dy3+ were added to B. subtilis broth to increase a-amylase activity [22] . Ce3+, La3+ and Pr3+ at 30 μM slightly increased the methanol dehydrogenase activity of Bradyrhizobium sp. MAFF211645, but other heavier rare earths did not have the same effect [17]. La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, Nd3+ and Sm3+ at 30 μM also slightly increased the methanol dehydrogenase activity of Methylobacterium radiotolerans, while other heavier rare earth elements did not show any effects [16]. This result suggested that the rare earth ion effect depended on the dosage, initial addition time and rare earth type. The ethanol productivity of the addition of rare earth elements was better at 0 h than at 12 h (stationary phase). It is supposed that rare earth ions may impact some metabolic pathways."
9,Genetic stability of a high ethanol titer of C. thermocellum C2,"3.2 Genetic stability of a high ethanol titer of C. thermocellum C2 To validate the genetic stability of the high ethanol titer, the fermentation results of the six generation strains after removing Nd3+ are shown in Fig. 4 . The strains still had higher ethanol titers than the original strain, but the cellulose degradation ratio of the six generation strains after removing Nd3+ was not significantly different from that of the original strain. In summary, Nd3+ effectively increased the ethanol titer of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405, and this characteristic was stable and genetic. Nd3+ had genetic variation in C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 because this variation was heritable [28]. Therefore, it was speculated that the mechanism by which Nd3+ affects C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 was mutagenesis."
10,Effect of Nd3+ on growth,"3.3 Effect of Nd3+ on growth As shown in Fig. 5 , the growth of the strain with Nd3+ was determined. The logarithmic growth period of the original strain was between 2 and 11 h, when the biomass reached the maximum. As seen from the figure, the growth ratio of the strain with Nd3+ was lower than that of the original strain, but the logarithmic period was the same. Nd3+ slightly inhibited the growth of the strain, but Nd3+ had no significant influence on the cellulose degradation ratio. In terms of the ethanol synthesis pathway, Nd3+ had no promoting or inhibiting effect on the cellulose to cellulose-cellobiose pathway. Most of the literature has reported that a suitable concentration of rare earth ions can promote the growth of bacteria [29]. Therefore, the increase in ethanol titer was caused by the increase or decrease in flux in the metabolic pathway [30]. The action site of Nd3+ in the ethanol synthesis pathway of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 was preliminarily determined. That is, Nd3+ regulated and controlled metabolic fluxes of cellobiose to the ethanol pathway."
11,Distribution of Nd3+ in cells,"3.4 Distribution of Nd3+ in cells As listed in Table 5 , the distribution of Nd3+ in cells was analysed with ultrasonication and lysozyme methods. Nd3+ in the fermentation broth and washing water was not adsorbed by the cells. Nd3+ in the pickling solution formed complexes with the cell. Nd3+ in cell lysate entered into cytoplasm. Nd3+ in the enzymatic hydrolysis supernatant was attached to the cell wall, and Nd3+ in the protoplast was attached to the cytomembrane. Nd3+ hardly entered the cytoplasm, and most of them were adsorbed on the cell wall or cytomembrane. This result indicated that most Nd3+ was closely bound to the cell wall and that a little was bound to the cytomembrane [31]. This result was similar to that of Horiike, who found that Penidiella sp. strain T9 formed a precipitated Dy (T9-Dy) layer with a thickness of 1.0 μm over the cell surface, along with some intracellular nanometre-sized Dy particles [32]."
12,Effect of Nd3+ on cell phenotype,"3.5 Effect of Nd3+ on cell phenotype 3.5.1 Scanning electron microscope of the strains The cell morphology of the scanning electron microscope is shown in Fig. 6 . The cell surface of strain C0 was smooth and cylindrical. The cell surface of strain C1 was also cylindrical rods, but the surface was obviously rough and uneven (spot). The cell surface of strain C2 was also cylindrical and slightly curved, but there were also many bulges on the surface (spot). Nd3+ can lead the cell surface to be unsmooth and not compact. We supposed that it formed Nd-precipitated compounds on the cell surface particles, and the image (Fig. 6 b) was similar to the other’s result, in which rare earth ion-precipitated compounds on the cell surface formed nanometre-sized particles [32]. To further observe the cell wall, high magnification images are shown in Fig. 7 . The cell wall of strain C0 has a smooth surface and dense structure (Fig. 7 a-c). Compared with C0, the cell wall structure of strain C1 (Fig. 7 d-f) was not tighter and had many holes and bulges (spot). The cell wall structure of strain C2 (Fig. 7 h-i) was very similar to that of C1, and there were many small holes (spots). Nd3+ damaged the cell wall of C1 and could affect some genes [22], resulting in the cell phenotype of strain C2 having stable inheritance after removing Nd3+. The hole of the cell wall surface increased cell permeability, resulting in the nutrients being better transported into the cytoplasm and the metabolic products being excreted well. The feedback inhibition was reduced, and the conversion rate of ethanol was improved under the condition of the same soluble sugar with the same cellulose degradation ratio. It was one of the mechanisms of improvement ethanol production. 3.5.2 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of the cell wall As shown in Fig. 8 , the cell wall was analysed by FIRT. Compared with C0, the absorption peaks of strains C1 and C2 were enhanced at 2980, 15,401 1090, 1050 and 881 cm−1, respectively. According to the report, a peak appeared at 1541.96 cm−1, and Nd3+ had a direct bond with the oxygen on the carboxyl group and the nitrogen on the amide group [33]. The absorption peak at 1050–1090 cm−1 was a stretching vibration peak coupled to OH and CO of sugar hydroxyl groups. This might be due to complexation of Nd3+ and oxygen of sugar hydroxyl groups resulting in the sharp peak [25]. The absorption peak in 2980 cm−1 became stronger. Nd3+ participated in the bonding of nitrogen atoms on the end group and residual group of the side chain and affected the association of hydrogen bonds [33]. The absorption peak at 881 cm−1 was the vibration absorption peak of hydride-NH2. Nd3+ had the coordination with N on –NH2 [34]. The change in binding with Nd3 + can lead to a change in the cell phenotype."
13,Effects of Nd3+ on key enzymes of ethanol synthesis,"3.6 Effects of Nd3+ on key enzymes of ethanol synthesis The increase in flux in the metabolic pathway is the main method for increasing the target products. Among them, the increase in activity or expression of key enzymes (rate-limiting enzymes) is the most direct result of the increase in flux in the metabolic pathway. It was determined that Nd3+ had no significant influence on the cellulose degradation ratio. Therefore, this paper focused on the key enzymes of the ethanol pathway, and the mechanism by which Nd3+ increases ethanol titers was explored based on enzyme activity and enzyme expression. The synthesis of pyruvate is required by glycolysis in the metabolic pathway of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405. The key enzyme is 6-phosphate fructose kinase (PFK). As the key point of pyruvate decreases, it produces three branches: ethanol, acetic acid and lactic acid.. The key enzymes were focused on improving ethanol production. In this metabolic branch, the key enzymes are pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFO), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Therefore, the selected key enzymes are ADH, ALDH, PFO and PFK. 3.6.1 Effects of Nd3+ on the activity of key enzymes As shown in Fig. 9 , the ADH enzyme activity of C1 decreased 1.70 times compared with that of C0, while the activity of ALDH, PFO and PFK of C1 improved 1.33, 1.48 and 2.00 times, respectively. Compared with C0, the activities of ALDH, PFO and PFK of C2 were 1.30, 1.38 and 1.91 times higher, respectively. The activity of the four enzymes remained relatively constant after removing Nd3+. This result indicated that Nd3+ had a great impact on the activity of key enzymes in the ethanol synthesis pathway. Therefore, another mechanism of improvement ethanol production was the higher activity of key enzymes. 3.6.2 Effects of Nd3+ on the expression of key enzymes As shown in Fig. 10 , the enzyme expression of ADH of C1 was 0.21 times lower than that of C0, while the enzyme expression of ALDH, PFO and PFK of C1 was 11.70, 1.53 and 3.35 times higher than that of C0, respectively. The enzyme expression of ADH in C2 was 0.18 times lower than that in C0. The enzyme expression of ALDH, PFO and PFK in C2 was 11.01, 1.50 and 3.28 times higher than that in C0, respectively. After removing Nd3+, the expression of the four enzymes remained relatively constant. The expression of genes requires the joint of transcription and translation. The change in expression level is an important indicator of transcription level [35]. The data shown in Fig. 9 were very similar to those in Fig. 10, suggesting that the activity of key enzymes was mainly affected by the expression of enzymes. The expression of three key enzymes was significantly improved, which can promote the transcription of mRNA and increase the expression of key enzyme genes. Higher enzyme activity will stimulate the enzymatic reaction and then affect the consumption of substrate and the synthesis of products [36]. The results correspond to the higher activity of three key enzymes, and another mechanism of improvement ethanol production was higher expression of three key enzymes. Some studies have reported that the high activity of ADH can improve ethanol production [6,37], but in this research, the expression and activity of ADH decreased while the ethanol titer increased. ADH was the final enzyme in the metabolic pathway of ethanol production, and we supposed that the lower expression and activity of ADH was greatly affected by the end-product inhibition of ethanol. Therefore, the higher activity and expression of ALDH, PFO and PFK was one of important reasons. However, the specific reason for the higher transcription level was unclear. It is speculated that gene variation can have an important impact on the higher expression levels of key enzymes. 3.6.3 Analysis of gene sequence of key enzymes These factors lead to changes in enzyme activity and expression by Nd3+, including the regulation of enzyme proteins or enzyme transcription. The gene sequence of key enzymes was analysed. The results revealed that the gene sequences of ADH and ALDH of the three strains (C0, C1 and C2) did not vary (the result is not shown). Nd3+ cannot lead to gene mutation of ADH and ALDH. As shown in Table 6 , there were 9 bases changed in the sequence of C1, and the type of mutation was deletion and replacement. The transformation occurred 5 times. The base transition and deletion contained four types of bases, and almost all were mutations in a single base. It was suggested that Nd3+ had a slight effect on the DNA sequences of PFO. There were also 9 base mutations in the sequence of C2, and the type of mutation was deletion and replacement. Comparing C1 with C2, the mutation sites and types were almost identical. This result indicated that the gene mutation of PFO remained stable. The sequence of amino acids was predicted by DNAMAN. There were two codon variations of the amino acid sequences of three mutated gene sequences. The A codon (corresponding to the 537th base) changed to H, and the T codon (corresponding to the 1667th base) changed to A. The secondary structure of the amino acid sequence was analysed online by CFSSP, and then the spatial structure differences were compared. The results showed that there was no difference in the secondary structure. As shown in Table 7 , there were 13 base mutations of C1, and the mutation types were insertion, deletion and transformation. The transformation occurred two times, and deletion occurred two times. Nine bases were inserted. The probability of insertion was higher than deletion and transformation, and the four bases had changed. Almost all single base mutations, especially two adjacent bases, changed. Nd3+ influenced the DNA sequence of PFK. There were also 13 base mutations in C2, including insertions, deletions and transformations. The conversion occurred three times. There were 8 bases inserted. Compared with C1 and C2, the site and types of gene mutations were similar. This indicated that the gene mutations of PFK caused by Nd3+ were also stably inherited. The 4th codon became A and E. The 861st codon became P, Q and A. The secondary structure of the amino acid sequence was analysed, and the spatial structure differences were compared. There was no difference in the secondary structure. We compared the gene sequences of four key enzymes, C0, C1 and C2, and found that there were no gene mutations in ADH and ALDH. However, the expression and activity of ALDH increased most significantly. There were some gene mutations in the gene sequences of PFO and PFK, but this mutation did not cause changes in the spatial structure of the protein. This property can also be stably inherited. Therefore, more research is needed to test the mechanism by which the primary structure variation of proteins could affect catalytic performance. Zhang D Y [22] found that rare earth compounds, such as Dy3+ and Nd3+, had mutagenic effects on B. subtilis, and amylase activity was enhanced significantly. Individual gene amplification, cloning and sequencing of amylase proved that Dy3+ and Nd3+ changed the amylase gene from B. subtilis and affected gene renaturation and base pairing. This result indicated that rare earth ions affected gene mutation, but this effect was random, which was not the whole reason for the improvement in gene expression. The other possible reason was similar to that proposed by others [23], in which the silencing genes of enzymes were activated by rare earth ions. It was suggested that the transcription level might have an effect on gene expression."
14,Conclusions,"Many rare earth ions could increase the production of ethanol from cellulose by C. thermocellum ATCC 27405; in particular, the addition of 1 × 10−6 M Nd3+ had the best effect at 0 h, and the ethanol concentration was 98.36% higher than that of the control. Nd3+ slightly inhibited the growth of the strain, but it had no significant influence on the cellulose degradation ratio. High ethanol production resulted in stable genetic inheritance after removing Nd3+. To explore the specific mechanism by which the ethanol titer is improved, we first investigated the cell phenotype. Nd3+ could change the cell phenotype, as there were many holes and bulges on the cell wall surface. These holes increased cell permeability, resulting in the nutrients being better transported into the cytoplasm and the metabolic products being excreted well. Then, we preliminarily explored the reason for the four key enzymes in the ethanol synthesis pathway. The key enzymes were analysed at three levels: enzyme protein, expression, and DNA sequence. The increase in key enzyme activity and enzyme expression level in the ethanol synthesis pathway had a large contribution to the ethanol titer increase. However, the gene sequence of ALDH had no mutation. Gene sequencing of PFO and PFK showed some variation; although the amino acid codon of the gene mutation also had individual mutations, it had no effect on the high-level structure of the enzyme protein. This study not only provided a new way to improve the yield of cellulosic ethanol but also provided a reference for further study of rare earth ions in the field of microbiology. We declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that represents a conflict of interest in connection with the work submitted."
