0,Introduction,"India has registered higher growth in fish production considerably over the years, especially in the last decade. India is the second-largest producer of total fish as well as aquaculture in the world and constitutes around 6.4% of overall global fish production (NFDB, India). According to NFDB, India, the total fish production during 2017-18 projected to be 12.60 million metric tonnes with a contribution of 65% of the inland sector, and culture fisheries contributed to about 50% of the total production. Furthermore, global fish production in 2017 was about 175.2 million metric tonnes (Statista, 2018). Alongside fish production, enormous amounts of fish by-products are originated from the processing of fish from domestic markets as well as fishing industries. The discards produced from the fish processing plants or domestic markets are normally termed as fish discards or fish processing wastes. The fish discards (by-products) generated includes head, fins, scales, bones, viscera, trimmings and skin mixed with waste water. The fish discards produced depends on the type of fish, product, and processing techniques and generally ranges from 20 to 70% of the total fish weight (Jaiswal et al., 2014). India generates approximately more than 4 million metric tonnes of by-products as waste per year (Yuvaraj et al., 2016). Apart from processing by-products, bycatch fish from the sea or fish farming is also generated in a significant amount, which is also discarded as waste. At present, some of the by-products generated are used to produce fishmeal, fertilizer, pet food, fish silage, or retailed as animal feed at a low price. However, these fish discards are considered to have not much benefit. They are simply dumped into the environment, mainly landfills and water bodies, even without evaluating that it may also be the source of biomolecules or other beneficial compounds and thereby creating disposal problems (Yuvraj et al., 2016). Therefore, the disposal of these by-products/fish discards in the future will have to comply with the more stringent ecological standards and mandate the recovery of value-added products therein. Presently, the majority of domestic markets do not have proper waste management systems. Besides, available technologies used for the utilization of these by-products have many bottlenecks such as poor functionality, off-odor, high cost of production. Thus, there is a need to address these issues and develop technology that utilizes the fish discards derived from marine as well as an inland fisheries sector, thereby making these processing wastes more viable and eco-friendly (Behcet, 2011). Generally, fish contains 0.3–45% (w/w) fat; however, the species of the specific fish, its age, sex, nutritional status, health, and time of year determine the amount of oil/fats (Koiakowska et al., 2010). It is well noted that the visceral mass of fish discards has a significant amount of oil or fat apart from proteins (Kudre et al., 2017). About 6–11 wt% of the effluent generated from the fish processing industry will be oil (Adewale et al., 2015). Furthermore, a huge amount of fish oil produced as a by-product in the process of fishmeal production. More than 34 000 tonnes of fish oil generate by Indian coastal states annually (Ponnusamy and Kondusamy, 2012). Despite the growth in the production and availability of fish oil, there is no growth in the fish oil market at the same rate. Moreover, some extent of fish oil finds its application in drug as well as the food industry as a source of ω-3 fatty acids such as EPA & DHA, which represents 15%–20% of the fatty acids present in fish oil while remaining oil is considered as useless. Although fish oil possesses several health benefits, the presence of highly unsaturated fatty acids results in auto-oxidation of fish oil. Besides, oil from fish or fish discards cannot be suitable for edible purposes. Therefore, there is a need to overcome the current persisting problems associated with fish discards, one of it would be to determine the applications of fish oil extracted from discards, thereby making it more worthwhile and eco-friendly (Kudre et al., 2017). One of the best possible options would be the exploitation of fish discards oil for the production of biodiesel. The rest of the protein-rich material can be used for the production of animal feed or fertilizer. Currently, fossil fuels that are widely being utilized are non-renewable energy resources. Despite their extensive usage, they have also raised environmental concerns and political debate (Gashaw et al., 2015). Fossil fuels have got the major downside since it primarily accounts for air pollution by emitting greenhouse gases, also air contaminants, including NOX, SOX, CO, volatile organic compounds and particulate air matter (Kannahi and Arulmozhi, 2013). The problems caused by this depleting, polluting, non-renewable energy source have driven the interest in the discovery of alternative renewable fuels. Renewable energy has a direct correlation with sustainable development because it holds strong impacts on energy security, social development, climate change mitigation, and reduction of environmental and health impacts (Owusu and Asumadu-Sarkodie, 2016). Additionally, the renewable energy sector promotes economic development via linking economic growth and expansion of energy consumption. Therefore, the developmental plans and national policies of many countries, including India, are mainly focused on the sustainable renewable energy development to replace petroleum-derived materials from fossil fuel-based energy sources. The world has introduced some renewable energy sources including; bioenergy, solar energy, geothermal energy, hydropower, ocean, and wind energy. These renewable sources are the most outstanding and potential to achieve the idea of sustainability and legacy for future generations. Many works of the literature suggest that the bio-origin energy sources would help in achieving sustainability since it would help to overcome the drawbacks of fossil fuels, combat climate change, and form clean energy sources. However, limited access to raw materials, lack of facts, and market failures has impeded the sustainability of renewable energy resources (Owusu and Asumadu-Sarkodie, 2016). Currently, bioethanol and biodiesel production in the bioenergy sector is acquiring momentum owing to the drawbacks of fossil fuel. Depending on the types of feedstocks, biofuels are mainly categorized as the first generation, second generation, and third generation biofuels (Biofuels, 2010). The first generation feedstocks comprise of edible vegetable oils derived from plant sources such as sunflower, rapeseed, soybean, palm, peanut, etc. for biodiesel (Bhuiya et al., 2016) and sugarcane, cassava, sweet sorghum, wheat and sugar beet for bioethanol production (Biofuels-first generation biofuels, 2010). Lignocelluloses are second generation feedstock for bioethanol (Biofuels-second generation biofuels, 2010) and non-edible oils derived from sources such as jatropha, moringa, rice bran, coconut, sesame, etc. and waste cooking oil for biodiesel (Bhuiya et al., 2016). Microalgae form third generation feedstock (Biofuels-third generation biofuels, 2010), whereas environmental CO2, H2O, and heat energy are the fourth generation feedstocks (Bhuiya et al., 2016). Biodiesel can be derived from plant oil, marine oil, and animal fat. The biggest challenges posing the production of biodiesel are the availability and the cost of the feedstock. Plant oil cannot be an ideal feedstock since there is a huge demand for crops in food, feed, and oleo-chemical industry. This limits the use of vegetable oil or plant-based oil as a feedstock for the preparation of biodiesel (Dave et al., 2014). At present, low-cost feedstocks such as animal fats, soapstock, greases, waste cooking oil have been gaining importance due to the pitfalls associated with the plant oil as biodiesel feedstock. However, there are certain bottlenecks associated with these feedstocks too. The presence of free fatty acids and saturated fats at a high percentage in waste cooking oil and animal fats, respectively, limits its utilization as feedstock for biodiesel preparation (Madhu et al., 2017). Taking into consideration the drawbacks and prospects of currently used feedstocks, the world is serious towards finding an ideal, low-cost feedstock, new feedstock for sustainable biodiesel production. In this regard, aquatic resources have gained considerable attention. The preparation of biodiesel from algae has been studied at a practical level, but the biodiesel preparation from fish discards is still limited. In recent years, very few researchers have attempted to investigate the production and performance of biodiesel in diesel engines from fish oil from fish waste. Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada has reported that they had some success in producing biodiesel from salmon oil (Dave et al., 2014). Furthermore, AQUAFINCA and ENERFISH, started projects to produce biodiesel from fish waste oil at the commercial level. Thus, fish oil derived from fish discards can be easily converted to biodiesel, a renewable, clean-burning fuel with the potential to improve air quality and reduce the dependency on imported fuel. Fish discards could be the cheap feedstock for biodiesel production since it is a waste and is simply dumped into the environment. Fish oil, mainly composed of unsaturated fatty acids, especially PUFAs, could improve fuel flow fluidity at low operating temperatures. Transesterification process is the most commonly followed method for biodiesel production from any oils or fats (Gashaw et al., 2015). Furthermore, glycerin is a co-product of the biodiesel process, which has potential applications in pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic purposes. Moreover, the integration of biodiesel production with the fish harvesting and processing industry would help to improve the economy of the nation and also generate employment opportunities. Therefore, fish oil from fish discards could be a potential feedstock for sustainable biofuel production and can decrease the negative environmental impact resulting from it. Against this background, the holistic objective of the of the present article is to explore the fish discards as an alternative feedstock for biofuel production, the various techniques that can be employed for the fish oil biodiesel production, fuel properties, advantages over other feedstocks, the possibility of utilization of fish oil biodiesel as biojet fuel and prospects. Moreover, some factors, such as fish waste oil quality, biodiesel preparation method, alcohol to oil ratio, type and amount of catalyst, reaction temperature, and time affect the conversion yield and quality of biodiesel have been described comprehensively. This review will help researchers to analyze that fish discards can be a potential alternative renewable feedstock for biofuel production, which meets the goal of reducing greenhouse gases and could ensure fuel supply in the future."
1,Methodology,"The current work is mainly designed based on the literature review extracted from Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases. Furthermore, FAO and NFDB web sources were used for retrieving the latest information on global total fish production and also the Indian scenario. Different key factors such as total fish production, total fish waste production, total lipids in fish waste, the fatty acid composition of fish oil, biodiesel production of fish oil, properties of fish oil biodiesel, economic benefits from by-product generated, and future scope of fish oil biodiesel were considered for reviewing the present study. Accordingly, we identified the relevant pieces of literatures and mapped content of the selected literatures by extracting information using a set of questions pertinent to the theme of the present review. The information and data from other literatures focused on the fish oil extraction, fish oil biodiesel production, and properties of fish oil biodiesel were surveyed for deriving the conclusion that how the fish oil extracted from the fish discards would help in the sustainable production of biodiesel. The web sources were visited daily for the latest updates till the completion of the review, and also latest literatures were referred. Fig. 1 displays an overview of the methodology followed for this review paper."
2,Global scenario of fish production,"The approximate amount of fish waste generated every year across the globe can only be evaluated if the annual fish production is known. In the year 2016, total capture fish production globally was 90.9 million tonnes, which is comparatively less than in 2015 and 2014 with the production of 92.7 and 91.2, respectively Fig. 2 (a) . The total aquaculture production in the year 2016 was 80 million tonnes, which is higher than the production of 76.1 and 73.7 in the years 2014 and 2015, respectively. The total aquaculture production went on increasing from 2011 to 2016 Fig. 2(b). When we add the total world fisheries and aquaculture production, the overall production in the year 2016 comes to 170.9 million tonnes Fig. 2(c) (FAO, 2018). When we glance into the Indian scenario, the total marine capture production in the year, 2016 was around 3.6 million tonnes whereas total inland capture production in the year 2016 was 1.4 million tonnes and the total aquaculture food fish production in the year 2016 was 5.7 million tonnes (FAO, 2018). There has been an increase in global fish production to meet the demand of human fish consumption. Moreover, in the near future, fish production might increase furthermore to overcome the food shortage, which may arise due to the population explosion. Besides the production of fishes in a million tonnes globally, tremendous amounts of fish wastes are also generated. With the increase in fish production, there will also be the increased production of fish discards. If we consider globally, in the year 2016, the total fish production was 170.9 million tonnes, and the fish discards generated maybe somewhere around 52 to 85 million tonnes. Similarly, in India, the fish discards generated maybe around 3 to 5 million tonnes. The number may increase with an increase in production, but most of it goes unutilized and gets dumped into the environment."
3,Recognized biodiesel feedstocks and their drawbacks,"Most of the recognized feedstocks used for biodiesel production are vegetable oils. The United States is the leading biodiesel producer in the world with the production of 6 billion liters for the year 2017, followed by Brazil, Germany, and Argentina with 4.3 billion, 3.5 billion and 3.3 billion liters production, respectively Fig. 3 (a). Moreover, India produced only 0.2 billion liters, but is one of the leading biodiesel producers in the world (Statista, 2018). The vegetable oils employed for biodiesel preparation include edible oils - rapeseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, palm oil, cottonseed oil, etc. (Karmakar et al., 2010), and non-edible oils - Pongamia oil, jatropha oil, desert date oil, tung oil, etc. (Moser, 2009). There has been an expeditious increase in vegetable oil production over the past decades because of its extensive demand in industries, and biodiesel production. According to FAO (FAO, 2018), in the year 2017-18, the oilseed production was estimated to touch 586 million tonnes, and the overall production was 575 million tonnes. Over the past ten years, the production of oilseeds has been increased to more than 50% (UFOP, 2018). Apart from vegetable oil; soapstock, animal fats, and waste cooking oil have also been utilized as raw materials for biodiesel preparation (Suresh et al., 2019). As in 2016, the widely utilized feedstock for biodiesel production was palm oil. Apart from that, soybean oil and rapeseed oil, waste cooking oil, and animal fats are also being used as feedstock for the production of biodiesel Fig. 3(b) (UFOP, 2018). However, biodiesel production from these recognized feedstocks holds several drawbacks. The main hurdle restricting the utilization of vegetable oil in biodiesel production is the limited availability of lands to cultivate various seed oils. Moreover, for humankind, vegetable oils are the key source of food (Fadhil and Ahmed, 2016). In case if we rely solely on vegetable oil as feedstock, the world is likely to suffer from the shortage of food in the future. Animal fats, including chicken, beef, and lard fats, are used as raw material for biodiesel preparation, but they have own limitation due to presence higher content of saturated fatty acid. Biodiesel made from this feedstock tends to gel, limiting the widespread application of this type of fuel, particularly for winter-time use (Fadhil and Ahmed, 2016). Besides, algal oil is another raw material that has been employed for the preparation of biodiesel, but for sustainable production, novel and economical culturing and harvesting technology need to be developed for microalgae (Singh et al., 2013). The production of biodiesel would be sustainable if waste cooking oil is used as feedstock, but this feedstock contains a high amount of free fatty acids, which cause the saponification in the presence of base catalyst, resulted in a decrease the biodiesel yield (Suresh et al., 2019). In such feedstocks, it is necessary to neutralize the free fatty acids prior to transesterification reaction or carry out the two-step transesterification reaction wherein free fatty acids are initially esterified by acid catalyst. Considering these facts, the production of biodiesel from fish discards would help to overcome the pitfalls of various biodiesel feedstocks in the following ways: i. Fish discards could reduce the cost of production since it is a waste and accounts for up to 30–50% of total fish production. In biodiesel production, feedstock itself contributes to around 45–50% of biodiesel production cost. ii. Fish discards comprise lipids, apart from which it can also be the source of biocatalyst (lipase) and heterogeneous chemical catalyst. iii. Apart from biodiesel production, it helps in reducing the pollution caused by dumping fish discards to the environment. iv. Utilization of fish discards as biodiesel feedstock wouldn’t create food shortage problems, unlike vegetable oils since fish oil is non-edible oil. So, even though there are recognized feedstocks for biodiesel production, they may not be suitable for the sustainable production of biodiesel and maybe posing as a treat for the future survival of humans by creating food shortage. Thus, in future biodiesel production from most of the recognized feedstock sources would be inconsequential."
4,Fish discards as a source of biofuel,"Owing to the drawbacks associated with the recognized feedstocks for biofuel production, an alternative feedstock need to be recognized. Fish discards can be a potential alternative feedstock for the production of not only biodiesel but also biomethane. The oil extracted from fish discards could be employed as biodiesel feedstock. But, limited works have been carried out on the biofuel production from fish discards. Besides, fish viscera, which are also a waste usually discarded, can be a source of many enzymes, and fish bones and scales can be exploited in the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts which can be employed for the sustainable production of biodiesel. Fig. 4 displays the overview of possible biofuel production from fish discards."
5,Lipids in the fish discards,"5.1 Lipids in the fish discards The lipid profile in the fish varies depending on the fish type, and different abiotic and biotic factors of the fish dwell (Koaikowska et al., 2010). Type of feed and volume, season, the temperature of the water, pH of water, salinity of water, and reproductive cycle affects the composition and content in fish discards (Moradi et al., 2011). Different fishes have different major lipid storing site. The primary storage sites include belly flap, subcutaneous tissue, muscle tissue, mesenteric tissue, and head. In most of the fish species, non-edible offal has higher lipid content than in fillets with skin, and most of these parts are dumped as waste (Khoddami, 2009). Swapna et al. (2010) observed significant lipid content in the head and viscera of five Indian freshwater fishes, including Rohu (Labeo rohita), Mrigal (Cirrhinus cirrhosus), Catla (Catla catla), Tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) and Carp. This non-edible offal is the major by-product of the fish processing industry. Various methods, such as chemical processes, enzymatic processes, cooking, and pressing, are usually employed for the extraction of fish oil (Ramakrishnan et al., 2013). The most preferred chemical processes used for the extraction of fish oil include goldfisch method, digestion method (Ramakrishnan et al., 2013), and chloroform/methanol/water method (Dave et al., 2014). The fish oil extrication by the chemical process is complex, wherein extraction solvents have to be removed, which requires surplus energy. In industries, cooking and pressing is the traditionally followed method for the extraction of fish oil. However, this method is considered to be harsh on biomolecules such as lipids as well as protein, the by-products obtained during cooking, and pressing (Ramakrishnan et al., 2013). The enzymatic process of fish oil extraction was developed using proteases. The enzymatic hydrolysis don’t produce any by-product and is executed at low temperatures. For fish oil extraction, several enzymes such as lipase, nutrase, alcalase, protamex, and flourzyme have been employed (Rai et al., 2010). As per the work carried out by Kudre et al. (2017) wet reduction method was found to be the most effective method for the maximum recovery of oil compared to other oil extraction techniques. Recently, separation of oil from waste, especially visceral mass, has been attempted by the fermentation method using lactobacillus (Rai et al., 2010). In general, phospholipids, TAG, and sterols are the main lipids present in the fish (Moradi et al., 2011). Of all these lipids, mainly TAG is required for the production of biodiesel via a transesterification reaction. Other than TAG, MAG and DAG also take part in the production of biodiesel whereas free fatty acids undergo transesterification only when enzyme catalyst is employed."
6,Fatty acid composition of fish discards,"5.2 Fatty acid composition of fish discards Usually, whole fish or fish discards are used for the extraction of fish oil. The fish discards could be an important fish oil source for biodiesel production (Zuta et al., 2003). The fatty acid analysis of oil extracted from fish discards indicates the presence of SFA and unsaturated fatty acids, including MUFA, as well as PUFA alike other oils (Ghaly et al., 2013). The fatty acids present in fish oil play a pivotal role in defining the properties of biodiesel produced using the same (Kim et al., 2018). It has been found that around 15–20% of fish oil is constituted by two main ω-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA (Ghaly et al., 2013). These two fatty acids have been scientifically proven to have positive human health impact and are known to reduce the chance or risk of vascular and heart disease, depression, cancer, and ensure proper neural development (Ivanovs and Blumberga, 2017). Many researchers have carried out the fatty acid analysis of various fish discards of different fishes including Mackerel (Zuta et al., 2003), European carp (Cyprinus carpio) (Fadhil et al., 2015), Salmon (Salmo salar) and yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) (He et al., 2011), Rohu (Labeo rohita), Mrigal (Cirrhinus cirrhosus), Catla (Catla catla), Tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) and Carp (Swapna et al., 2010), yellow eye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) (Oliveira et al., 2009), black scabbard fish (Aphanopus carbo) (Batista et al., 2010), bigmouth sculpin (Hemitripterus bolini), flat head sole (Hippoglosoides elassodon), arrow tooth flounder (Atheresthes somias), spiny head rock fish (Trachyscorpia cristulata), pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), walleye Pollock (Gadus chalcogramus) and pacific halibut (Hippoglosus stenolepis) (Bechtel and Oliveira, 2006). The fatty acid profile of extracted oil from various fish offal’s is displayed in Table 1 (a-f). It is evident from most of the research on the fatty acid analysis that the dominant fatty acid includes palmitic acid and oleic acid, and the fatty acid profile of fish waste of various fishes varies. Bechtel and Oliveira (2006) reported the presence of oleic acid and palmitic acid as the dominant fatty acids in the liver of seven different cold-water fish. It has been stated if there is a right balance between the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the feedstock; it could be employed for biodiesel preparation (Kudre et al., 2017). Moreover, the fatty acid composition of most of the fish discards was found to have the right balance of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (Table 1a–f). Hence, fish discards could be used as an ideal feedstock for the production of biodiesel."
7,Biodiesel,"Generally, biodiesel can be defined as the mono-alkyl esters of oils or fats (where the alkyl group depends on the type of alcohol used) obtained by chemical processes that could replace fossil fuels or can be blended with it (Kudre et al., 2017). The different methods for biodiesel production (Fig. 5 ), the parameters affecting the biodiesel production, properties of fish oil biodiesel and biomethane from fish discards are discussed below."
8,Different methods of biodiesel production,"6.1 Different methods of biodiesel production For the production of biodiesel, there are some of the well-established accepted technologies. (Abbaszaadeh et al., 2012). Different methods for the production of biodiesel (Fig. 5) are described below. 6.1.1 Direct use and blending of oil The first attempt for the utilization of vegetable oil as a substitute for fuel can be dated back to the Paris exhibition of 1900, where peanut oil was used to operate the compression ignition engine by Rudolph Diesel. (Canakci and Sanli, 2008). The direct use of oil, as such, has been problematic in diesel engines and has inherent failings. In order to overcome the problems of pure oils with high viscosities, it can be diluted with diesel. With the use of pure oil, energy consumption was observed to be similar to diesel. Oil to diesel ratio of 1:10–2:10 for a short time using has been successful. The heating and blending may reduce viscosity, but the significant engine modification is required for the use in the diesel engine. The direct use or blend of fish waste oil would mainly depend on its physicochemical characteristics. Parandhaman et al. (2017) studied the fuel properties of different blends of fish fat oil with diesel (B25, B50, B75, B100) and stressed that fish fat oil and their esters could be employed as a complete or partial substitute for diesel. Moreover, it wouldn’t be ideal for the commercial exploitation of fish oil extracted from discards directly or its blend with diesel fuel in a diesel engine owing to certain complications such as viscosity, fatty acid content, etc. 6.1.2 Pyrolysis of oils Pyrolysis or thermal cracking is also one of the methods of biodiesel production, which involves heating with the support of catalysts for the conversion of one organic substance into another (Abbaszaadeh et al., 2012). The production of biodiesel by thermal cracking of oils was found to generate various proportions of aliphatic hydrocarbons such as carboxylic acids, alkanes, double-bonded alkenes, alkadienes and aromatic hydrocarbons (Gashaw et al., 2015). The pyrolysis process is simple, effective, zero wastage, and doesn’t cause pollution. The pyrolysis of triglycerides is known to yield liquid products (bio-oil), which has a very complex composition. The particular analysis technique is required for the determination of bio-oil composition, and it is very difficult to determine the precise composition. Characterization of biofuels obtained by the pyrolysis of fish discard oil has been carried out (Wisniewski et al., 2010). Wisniewski et al. (2010) obtained light bio-oil and heavy bio-oil after pyrolysis of fish waste oil at a temperature of 525 °C in a continuous reactor pilot plant with 3.2 kg h −1 mass flow rate followed by simple distillation. Wiggers et al. (2009) carried out the pyrolysis of oil extracted from fish wastes at 525 °C for 17 s residence time with the moisture content of 5% in fish oil and obtained of bio-oil (72.83%), biogas (15.85%) and coke (11.32%). Further quantification analysis of bio-oil showed light bio-oil (36.86%), Heavy bio-oil (34.83%), and oily sludge (2.14%). Furthermore, the pyrolysis of fish oil extracted from waste is not preferred because it holds few drawbacks. The density of pyrolysis oil was found to be more than that of fish oil (Krutof and Hawboldt, 2016). Moreover, the presence of high water and oxygen lowers the calorific value of pyrolyzed oil. The calorific value of the pyrolyzed oil can be increased by mixing with fish oil (Krutof and Hawboldt, 2016). Even though pyrolysis may be one of the good possible methods for generating biofuels in an eco-friendly way, the drawbacks of fuels produced points out on improvising or designing better blending methods. Apart from that production of biodiesel from fish oil using this method would not be cost-effective. Thus the commercial preparation of biodiesel by this method is non-preferable. 6.1.3 Micro-emulsion of oils Micro-emulsification involves the formation of microemulsions of oils with solvents such as methanol, ethanol, and 1-butanol, generally carried out to overcome the high viscosity (Abbaszaadeh et al., 2012). In micro-emulsification, higher alcohols and alkyl nitrates are used as surfactants and cetane improvers, respectively, whereas lower alcohols play a major role in lowering viscosity and hence used as additives. The decrease in viscosity, improved cetane number, and excellent spray characters in biodiesel are achieved by micro-emulsification of oil. The problems such as injector needle sticking, carbon deposit formation, and incomplete combustion in the diesel engines arise due to the continuous use of micro-emulsified diesel (Gashaw et al., 2015). The drawbacks of this method make it to be less widely preferred, and henceforth cannot be preferred for the biofuel preparation from fish discards. Besides, till date, no attempts have been made for the preparation of micro-emulsions of fish oil extracted from fish discards. Even though the production of micro-emulsified diesel is cost-effective, the poor combustion of the fuel in the diesel engine limits its commercial application."
9,Transesterification,"6.2 Transesterification Transesterification is a chemical reaction in which oils and fats react with an alcohol (methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol) in the presence of a catalyst, which may either chemical catalysts or biocatalysts to give fatty acid alkyl ester (FAAE) and glycerin as a by-product. The transesterification reaction is carried out at elevated temperatures in the presence of a catalyst (mainly acid or alkali catalysts) (Mishra and Goswami, 2018). Moreover, the process is easy to carry out and also cost-effective, which makes it the most widely accepted chemical processes for the production of biodiesel (Mishra and Goswami, 2018). 6.2.1 Acid catalyzed transesterification Acid catalyzed transesterification process utilizes acids, mostly sulfuric acid or sulfonic acid, and in the case of organic substrates, it is the most suited process. HCl, BF3, H3PO4 are other homogenous acid catalysts besides sulfuric acid and sulfonic acid used in acid catalyzed transesterification process (Bharathiraja et al., 2014). In heterogeneous acid catalyzed transesterification reaction, liquid acid catalysts are replaced by solid acid catalysts. The advantages of solid acid catalysts over liquid acid catalysts include, they are insensitive to free fatty acids, the simultaneous occurrence of esterification and transesterification, lower level of product contamination due to easy separation of catalysts from the reaction medium, elimination of washing step of biodiesel, regeneration and recycling of the catalyst is easy, and less corrosion problem. Zeolites, ZrO2, TiO2, SnO2, sulfonated carbon-based catalyst, Sulfuric ion-exchange resins, HPAs, sulfonic modified mesostructure silica, are some of the solid acid catalysts used in heterogeneous acid catalyzed transesterification reaction (Lam et al., 2010). Generally, the production of biodiesel via acid catalyzed transesterification requires high alcohol to oil molar ratios, reaction temperature, and also catalyst concentration for maximum biodiesel yield. Recently, Casiello et al. (2019) carried out biodiesel production using a combination of heterogeneous acid (ZnO) and ionic liquid (TBAI) as a catalyst from both edible and non-edible oil including fish oil. The biodiesel yield of ∼92% was obtained at general reaction conditions-feedstock 0.5 ml, TBAI (30% w/w), ZnO (2% w/w), methanol 4 ml at reaction temperature and time of 65 °C and 7 h respectively. The use of acid catalysts, even in the production of biodiesel from fish discards had limited success since it catalyzes transesterification slowly and requires elevated temperature. The slow reaction process and requirement of high temperature would increase the cost of production. Furthermore, these acid catalysts are not widely preferred for biodiesel preparation. Hence, the utilization of acid catalysts couldn’t be ideal for the commercial preparation of biodiesel from fish discards. 6.2.2 Alkali catalyzed transesterification Commonly utilized catalysts for transesterification are NaOH and KOH. Similar to homogeneous and heterogeneous acid catalysts, there are also homogeneous and heterogeneous base or alkaline catalysts. NaOH and KOH can be categorized under a homogeneous base catalyst. NaOH and KOH can catalyze transesterification at low reaction temperature and pressure, and also in minimum time, maximum biodiesel conversion can be achieved (Lam et al., 2010). Some of the examples of heterogeneous base catalysts include CaO, CaMgO, CaZnO, CaO–NiO, and MgZnAlO. The problem, such as saponification and separation of glycerol from the biodiesel layer, which is associated with a homogeneous base catalyst, has been overcome by the heterogeneous base catalyst. The main drawback of heterogeneous base catalyst is its high affinity towards water and moisture (Mardhiah et al., 2017). Few reports are available on the production of reusable heterogeneous base catalysts from the fish bones. These heterogeneous catalysts primarily include hydroxyapatite and β-tricalcium phosphate, both obtained by calcination process. Boutinguiza et al. (2012) prepared biological hydroxyapatite from dried fish bones of swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and also tuna fish (Thunnus thymus) by calcination in a muffle furnace at 600 °C and 950 °C at 10 °C/min heating rate and also found the traces of β-tricalcium phosphate in 950 °C calcined powder. Chakraborty et al. (2011) noted the significant transformation of hydroxyapatite derived from rohu (Labeo rohita) scales to β-tricalcium phosphate when calcined for 120 min at a temperature above 900 °C. The obtained β-tricalcium phosphate had been utilized for transesterification of soybean oil, and 97.73% biodiesel yield was derived for oil to methanol ratio of 1:6.27 using 1.01 wt% of oil β-tricalcium phosphate catalyst obtained at a calcination temperature of 997.42 °C. β-tricalcium phosphate catalyst was reused six times over reaction time of 5 h, and the catalyst showed the retention of its activity. Moreover, the cost of production of heterogeneous alkali catalysts from fish bones, scales is very low. The low cost and potential to be reused would make these catalysts ideal for the production of biodiesel. When this catalyst is used in the production of biodiesel along with cheaper feedstocks such as fish discards, the cost of biodiesel production may further reduce, thereby ensuring much sustainable production. Fadhil and Ali (2013) studied the effect of homogeneous catalysts such as NaOH and KOH on the biodiesel yield and obtained the maximum biodiesel yield from Silurus triostegus fish waste oil with KOH catalyst at 0.50% w/w of oil concentration at reaction time and temperature for 60 min and 32 °C, respectively. According to the research done by Madhu et al. (2017), the highest biodiesel yield of 96.6% was obtained from fish waste oil using 2.5% w/w of CaO catalyst prepared from waste crab carapace for oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:12 at 65 °C reaction temperature and 90 min reaction time. Kudre et al. (2017) obtained a maximum biodiesel yield of ∼96% with 0.75 wt% of KOH for oil to methanol volume ratio of 1:0.5, and the reaction temperature of and reaction time were 55 °C and 60 min. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous base catalysts from fish discards could be used for biodiesel production from fish discards and aid in the cost-effective production of biodiesel. The heterogeneous base catalyst prepared from fish discards holds better future prospects in sustainable biodiesel production because of its easy recovery and reusability, but still, furthermore, research needs to be carried out in this aspect. Currently, homogeneous base catalysts are widely preferred for commercial preparation of biodiesel since it is more soluble in alcohol, efficient than other catalysts, requires less time and low temperature, which makes the process cost-effective. 6.2.3 Enzyme catalyzed transesterification The most widely known enzyme used for transesterification reaction is lipase. Lipase (EC 3.1.1.3, triacylglycerols acyltransferases) hydrolyzes the carboxyl ester bonds of triglycerides (Kuepethkaew et al., 2017). Transesterification reaction can be executed using both intracellular and extracellular lipase. In the case of intracellular lipase, the whole cell is immobilized as biocatalyst for transesterification reaction, whereas in the case of extracellular lipase, only the enzyme is immobilized (Ranganathan et al., 2008). Lipases are omnipresent, being produced from various microorganisms, plants, and animals (Gupta et al., 2004). Plant and animal lipases are less stable than microbial lipases (Pourzolfaghar et al., 2016). Bacterial lipases have gained commercial importance than other lipases since they can be easily produced in bulk (Gupta et al., 2004). The prime hurdle blocking the application of lipase in the industry is the cost of its production. However, this hurdle could overcome by immobilizing the lipase. Lipase immobilization decreases the redundant by-products due to elongated contact between enzyme and substrate and also enables enzyme recycling. Apart from being the source for the heterogeneous catalyst, fish discards can also be a source of biocatalyst as lipase. Lipase extracted from fish discards could be an ideal biocatalyst for biodiesel production if they are found to be stable. Kuepethkaew et al. (2017) used lipase, which was purified partially extracted from the hepatopancreas of pacific white shrimp for the biodiesel production from palm oil and procured 97.01% fatty acid methyl esters using 70 kUnit lipase dosage at a 45 °C for 1:4 oil to methanol molar ratio and 16 h reaction duration. However, the reusability of this biocatalyst was not determined. Further, the lipase isolated from fish discards could also be an ideal biocatalyst for biodiesel production even from fish discards, provided if it is temperature and solvent stable, and can be reused for many cycles. Till date, the enzyme catalysts have not been preferred for commercial biodiesel production from fish oil. Further, enzyme catalyzed transesterification could be costly if maximum reusability of an enzyme is not achieved, and a lot of work needs to be carried out in finding the suitable enzyme for biodiesel production at the commercial level. 6.2.4 Microwave assisted transesterification reaction The application of electromagnetic energy and its development has captured the interest of many research groups. In microwave technology, heat is generated due to collisions and friction between the polar ends of molecules or ions (Lam et al., 2010). Compared to other conventional heating methods, microwave energy reduces reaction time and increases the reaction speed and ease the separation process. Kamalakkanan and Sankarlal (2016) studied the effect of microwave power on waste fish oil transesterification and stated that low microwave power of 170 W was ideal for the maximum biodiesel yield and the yield decreased with the increase in microwave power. Thus, high microwave power evaporates methanol making it less available for transesterification reaction and thereby reducing the yield. Despite being advantageous over conventional heating, microwave technology also possesses a disadvantage. One of the main disadvantages of microwave is it is not scalable to the industrial level. The main reason for this disadvantage is the depth of penetration of radiation in materials, which is absorbing it. The penetration depth of the microwave is limited to a few centimeters, depending on the material’s dielectric properties. Another reason for the rejection is the safe aspect (Mazo et al., 2011). Thus, the biodiesel preparation from waste fish oil on a large scale with microwave power is not favorable even though it is fast and has the upper hand to other conventional heating methods. Microwave technology has been employed so far both for the extraction of fish oil from the fish offal part as well as transesterification of fish waste oil. Sathivel et al. (2003) used microwave technology for the extraction of oil from the liver of farmed catfish and found that heating with 60–100% power of microwave for 80 s reduced the moisture content over 50% in the sample. Jaiswal et al. (2014) carried out microwave assisted transesterification reaction for waste fish oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:6 at 65 °C temperature and reaction time of only 10 min using 1.5 wt% of KOH catalyst with continuous stirring at 200 rpm. Kamalakkanan and Sankarlal (2016) obtained a biodiesel yield of about 99.20% from waste fish oil for 1:9 oil to methanol mole ratio at reaction duration of 4 min using KOH catalyst at a concentration of 1.5 wt% via microwave assisted transesterification reaction. Despite of even obtaining maximum yield with microwave assisted transesterification in short duration this technique cannot be employed in biodiesel production at the commercial level is due to a lower penetration depth of microwave radiation. 6.2.5 Ultrasound assisted transesterification reaction The conversion of oil to biodiesel is a slow process, and this led the researchers to employ technologies such as ultrasonic. Just like the use of microwave technology, ultrasonic technology was introduced to overcome the drawbacks of conventional technologies (Maghami et al., 2015). Ultrasound of low frequency is used for transesterification reaction. The required mechanical energy and activation energy for the transesterification reaction is provided by ultrasonic radiation. Ultrasonication is known to enhance the speed of chemical reaction and also improve the yield of biodiesel after transesterification (Mazo et al., 2011). Maghami et al. (2015) worked on the effect of ultrasound on the transesterification of fishmeal plant waste oil and found the increase in biodiesel yield has been from 73% to 79.86% with the increase in ultrasonic power from 100 to 400 W. As per the work carried out by Santos et al. (2010), 98.2% biodiesel yield has been obtained from oil extracted from viscera of Oreochromis niloticus (Nile Tilapia) carried out using low frequency high intensity ultrasound of 40 kHz after a reaction time of 90 min for 1:9 molar ratio of oil to alcohol and sulfuric acid catalyst at a concentration of 2 wt% of oil. Similar to microwave assisted transesterification reaction, the application of ultrasound for biodiesel production at the commercial level has limitations. The ultrasound application in biodiesel preparation at a commercial level fails to enhance process chemistry due to insufficient thermal energy creation. Thus, it is not widely preferred for the commercial production of biodiesel."
10,Comparison of different methods of transesterification,"6.3 Comparison of different methods of transesterification In the previous section, all four main methods employed for biodiesel production from fish oil are discussed. All the methods have their own advantages and limitations. Table 2 depicts the comparison of different methods of biodiesel production. The biodiesel produced by direct use or blending and micro-emulsion of oil is not preferred for its application in diesel engine owing to the poor properties associated with the fuel even though production cost is less. The biodiesel prepared by thermal cracking or pyrolysis possess ideal properties for its use in a diesel engine, but the production of biodiesel is expensive. However, the preparation of biodiesel by transesterification is cheaper, and properties of biodiesel are ideal for its use in the diesel engine. Currently, base catalyzed transesterification for the biodiesel production from fish oil is employed since it requires less time and low temperature to yield maximum biodiesel. Thus, among all the methods, transesterification is the most preferred and widely accepted method for biodiesel production."
11,Parameters to be optimized for biodiesel production,
12,Alcohol to oil ratio,"7.1 Alcohol to oil ratio Alcohol to oil ratio (either molar or volumetric) is the main variable governing transesterification reaction. For transesterification, the alcohol to triglyceride stoichiometric molar ratio is 3:1. The optimization of alcohol to oil ratio is very much required since it affects the production cost, and in order to drive the reaction to the right, higher molar ratios are required (Fadhil and Ahmed, 2016). To increase the solubility and contact between alcohol molecules and triglycerides, higher molar ratios are needed. In a short duration, greater ester conversion can be achieved by higher molar ratios (Mishra and Goswami, 2017). Various alcohols from short chain methanol to butanol and even amyl alcohol can be employed for obtaining alkyl esters by transesterification, but more frequently preferred alcohol is methanol because of its cheap cost and its advantage over other alcohols both physically and chemically. Besides methanol, ethanol is also preferred for transesterification since it hails from agricultural products. Another important factor to be considered is the miscibility of oil and alcohol. Transesterification reaction usually takes place at the interfacial region between oils and alcohols because both liquids are not completely miscible, thereby making transesterification a moderately slow process. In the case of two feedstocks, adequate mixing between the feedstock is crucial to promote contact between them and enhance the transesterification reaction. Henceforth, for scale-up and design, the effect of mixing on transesterification reaction forms the basis (Gashaw et al., 2015). The maximum biodiesel yield from fish discard oil could be obtained at methanol to oil molar ratio range of 3:1 to 9:1 and varies with fatty acid composition of fish oil."
13,Catalyst concentration,"7.2 Catalyst concentration Both acid and base catalysts are employed in the transesterification reaction. Apart from these enzymes are also exploited. But most widely used catalysts are base catalysts. Catalyst concentration has a major role to play in the biodiesel yield. Low concentration of base catalyst such as KOH requires more time to obtain a maximum conversion, whereas increasing its concentration decreases the time for maximum conversion (Fadhil et al., 2015). Kudre et al. (2017) studied the effect of both homogeneous base catalysts such as NaOH, KOH, and also heterogeneous base catalysts such as CaO and MgO at concentrations at a range of 0.5–1.5% w/v of oil on the biodiesel production from oil extracted from Rohu discards. An increase in catalyst concentration of NaOH and KOH more than 1.5% w/v resulted in saponification. Kupethkaew et al. (2017) determined the effect of different dosage of lipase extracted from the hepatopancreas of pacific white shrimp on palm oil biodiesel yield. Lipase dosage of 10 kUnit–100 kUnit was used, and 70 kUnit lipase dosage was found to be optimal for maximum biodiesel yield. The catalyst concentration for maximum biodiesel yield varies with the type of catalyst used. Homogeneous base catalyst concentration of 0.5–1 wt% of oil is ideal for maximum biodiesel yield from fish oil and catalyst concentration for enzyme catalyst and heterogeneous base catalyst differs."
14,Reaction time and temperature,"7.3 Reaction time and temperature Both reaction time and temperature are known to play a prime role in the transesterification reaction since it affects the production cost of biodiesel. Hence, the optimization of both reaction time and the temperature is very much required during biodiesel production. Temperature plays a pivotal role in speeding up the transesterification reaction process by elevating the collisions amongst the reactant molecules. It also weakens the chemical bonds and thereby eases the formation of bonds in the new product. Kudre et al. (2017) noticed the biodiesel yield from Rohu fish oil decreased after 120 min and suggested that longer reaction duration might have hydrolyzed the esters formed. In enzyme catalyzed transesterification reaction, high temperature cannot be employed since non-thermostable lipases denature at a higher temperature. The reaction temperature of enzyme catalyzed transesterification depends on the temperature stability of both free and immobilized lipase and also the optimum temperature of the lipase. Aramugam and Ponnusami (2017) obtained maximum biodiesel yield from waste sardine oil at a reaction temperature of 30 °C using immobilized A. niger lipase for 1:9 oil to methanol molar ratio in 10 h reaction time. The reaction time varies depending on the type of catalyst and also type of transesterification reaction. Acid and enzyme catalyzed transesterification reaction consume more time, whereas Microwave assisted transesterification reaction is fast. Maghami et al. (2015) obtained the maximum biodiesel yield from waste fish oil of fish meal plant at 55 °C. The biodiesel yield decreases at further higher temperature due to the evaporation of methanol. Thus for maximum biodiesel yield from fish discard oil, reaction temperature in the range 50–65 °C is preferred for homogeneous base catalyst, 50–80 °C for heterogeneous base catalyzed and acid catalyzed transesterification. Lipases catalyze transesterification reaction at lower temperature (<50 °C). Moreover, the reaction time ranges from 30 to 90 min for base catalysts, and enzyme catalyst require more reaction time (4 h–24 h)."
15,Properties of fish oil biodiesel,"Globally, advancements in biodiesel quality, including standardization of biodiesel quality, are being developed to ensure no engine performance problem from biodiesel, which is produced from different feedstocks of varying properties and qualities. The qualities and properties of biodiesel must hold with international biodiesel standard specifications. There is a standard specification from the US known as ASTM (6751-3), other standard specifications include EU (EN 14214) Germany (DIN 51 606), Austria (ON), Czech Republic (CSN) (Mishra and Goswami, 2017). The physicochemical and combustion properties of biodiesel have to be determined to ensure its suitability for the internal combustion engine. Table 2 represents some of the properties of biodiesel prepared from different fish discards. Some of the important properties of biodiesel are discussed below."
16,Viscosity,"8.1 Viscosity The property, mainly affecting the flow and atomization of the fuel is viscosity. Poor atomization is associated with the higher viscosity of the fuel (Lin and Li, 2009). Biodiesel has a viscosity 10–15 times higher than fossil fuel derived diesel due to its large chemical structure and large molecular mass (Mishra and Goswami, 2017). The high viscosity of biodiesel leads to poor atomization, ring sticking, carbon deposits, and fuel pump failure (Kupethkaew et al., 2017). It has been reported that marine fish oil biodiesel has poor injection and atomization performance; however, ultimately, it depends on the fatty acids present in the feedstock (Lin and Li, 2009). The acceptable viscosity limit range as per ASTM 445 are 1.9 mm2–6.0 mm2/s and 3.5–5.0 mm2/s. The biodiesel prepared from various freshwater and marine fish discards displayed viscosity in the range of 2.90–7.2 mm2/s (Table 3 ). The viscosity of fish discard oil biodiesel was within the international standards (ASTM) or was slightly higher. However, the viscosity of oil extracted from fish discards would mainly be determined by its fatty acid profile."
17,Oxidation stability,"8.2 Oxidation stability The quality of biodiesel may change during the long storage due to the oxidation of fatty acids. The oxidation stability is an important property to determine how long the biodiesel can be stored. Combustion of oxidized biodiesel causes carbon deposition in the combustion chamber, and higher NOx exhaust emissions are produced from oxidized biodiesel than non-oxidized one (Kim et al., 2018). If biodiesel contains more unsaturated fatty acids then greater is the degree of oxidation. Fish oil extracted from discards has a high amount of higher saturated fatty acids compared to most of the vegetable oil, thus the fish oil biodiesel must have slightly higher oxidation stability compared to biodiesel prepared from oilseeds. However, oxidation stability can be increased by the addition of antioxidants. Kudre et al. (2017) evaluated the oxidation stability of biodiesel prepared from Rohu waste oil using three different synthetic antioxidants-i. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), ii. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and, iii. Propyl Gallate (PG) at 300 mg/kg concentration for the duration of one month. Rohu fish oil biodiesel with BHT antioxidant showed better oxidation stability compared to BHA and PG, thereby suggesting biodiesel needs to be supplemented with antioxidants to improve its oxidative stability."
18,Density,"8.3 Density In the engine, the injection and combustion of fuel are also affected by density. Less efficient atomization, slow injection, and combustion are resultant of the higher density of the fuel. The density of biodiesel is higher compared to diesel. Biodiesel prepared from freshwater fish discards exhibited a density of 0.87 (Fadhil et al., 2015) to 0.88 (Fadhil et al., 2013) at 15.6 °C temperature (Table 3). The density of biodiesel (Fatty acid ethyl esters) prepared from fish processing discard oil also lies in the same range (Fadhil and Ahmed, 2016). Thus biodiesel from fish discards has less density and is not likely to affect the injection and combustion of it."
19,Flash point,"8.4 Flash point Flash point is referred to as fuel ignition temperature that takes place when it is exposed to flame or ignited by the ignition. The flash point is correlated with fuel volatility. Thus biodiesel has a higher flash point compared to conventional diesel (Kim et al., 2018). The flash point limit is 93 °C in ASTM D93 and 120 °C in EN ISO (Mishra and Goswami, 2017). The flash point of biodiesel produced from Cyprinus carpio waste fish oil and Silurus triostegus Heckel waste fish oil is 83 °C (Fadhil and Ahmed, 2016) and 87 °C (Fadhil et al., 2015) (Table 3), receptively which are lower than ASTM and EN standards thereby making biodiesel feasible. The marine fish oil biodiesel prepared by Lin and Li (2009) exhibited the flash point of 103 °C, which is higher than ASTM D93 standard value."
20,"Pour point, cloud point, and cold filter plugging point","8.5 Pour point, cloud point, and cold filter plugging point Pour point, cloud point and cold filter plug point determine the cold flow properties of biodiesel (Kim et al., 2018). Fuel solidification either completely or partially may result in obstruction of fuel lines and filters, thereby resulting in problems of starting, fuel deprivation, and engine damage. The lowest temperature below flow characteristics of the fuel is lost, known as the pour point of the fuel. ASTM D2500 and other international standards such as EN ISO 23 015 and D 97 procedures are used for pour point measurements. Cloud point can be defined as the temperature below which wax in biodiesel makes a cloudy appearance when it is chilled whereas the lowest temperature at which plugging of test filter takes place due to crystallization of fuel components is the cold filter plugging point (Lin and Li, 2009). The ASTM D6371 procedure is used for the measurement of cold filter plugging point. The unsaturated fatty acids, mainly PUFA in higher amounts helps to improve the cold flow properties of the fish oil biodiesel (Mishra and Goswami, 2017)."
21,Cetane number,"8.6 Cetane number The fuel’s compression ignition quality is indicated by the cetane number or cetane index. The larger cetane index is characterized by a shorter time of combustion and ignition delay, reduced events of knocking and NOx formation is lowered. The cetane number for biodiesel prepared from any feedstock specified by international standards and EN ISO 5165) are 47 (ASTM D613) and 51 (EN ISO 5165), respectively (Mishra and Goswami, 2017). The cetane number of fish oil biodiesel prepared from discards is almost near to the cetane number specified by ASTM D613 and EN ISO 5165, which ensures that fish oil biodiesel could be used in combustion engines."
22,Acid value,"8.7 Acid value The free fatty acids present in the fuel are determined by acid number, also known as neutralization number (Mishra and Goswami, 2017). The approved acid value for biodiesel by ASTM D664 and EN 14 104 is 0.50 mg KOH/g. The acid values for biodiesel from various fish discards, including Cyprinus carpio, Silurus triostegus, Labeo rohita, fish processing discard oil and marine fish discard oil are 0.007 (Fadhil et al., 2015), 0.39 (Fadhil et al., 2013), 0.25 (Kudre et al., 2017), 0.14 (Fadhil and Ahmed, 2016) and 1.17 respectively (Lin and Li, 2009) (Table 3). The results indicate that acid values of biodiesel from most of the fish oil were lower than ASTM and EN standard, thereby drawing to the conclusion that fish oil biodiesel can be utilized directly or blended with petrodiesel. Besides the above-mentioned properties, there are properties including heating value, auto ignition temperature, carbon residue, element O, ash of sulfate, available water and sediment, corrosion of copper strip, cold soak filtration, which needs to be evaluated for fish oil biodiesel (Mishra and Goswami, 2017). Lin and Li (2009) reported that marine fish oil biodiesel exhibited larger heating value, cetane number, carbon residue, and lower level of elemental oxygen compared to commercial biodiesel from waste cooking oil. Hong et al. (2013) reported that the heating value of biodiesel prepared from fish oil was higher than biodiesel prepared from other feedstocks, mainly vegetable oil and animal fat. Hence, the utilization of fish wastes oil helps to overcome the problems of disposing of fish processing waste and biodiesel production."
23,Blending evaluation of fish oil biodiesel with petrodiesel,"Fadhil et al. (2015), and Fadhil and Ahmed (2016) carried out the blending evaluation of biodiesel and petrodiesel and studied the properties of these blends. Totally 5 different blends (B10, B20, B30, B40, and B50) were studied both in the case of Cyprinus carpio fish waste oil (Fadhil et al., 2015) and waste fish oil (Fadhil and Ahmed, 2016), respectively. In both cases, the density of petrodiesel has been marked with increment in biodiesel content in blends. The increase in viscosity and flash point, too, was observed with the increment of biodiesel and remained within the ASTM standard limits. The pour point is an important cold flow property of biodiesel, which depends on the unsaturated fatty acid content in the oil. It is evident from the literatures that an increase in the biodiesel amount in blends is characterized by an increase in pour point. The blending of petrodiesel also reduces the acid value and refractive index of petrodiesel, which is higher when compared to biodiesel. The engine performance of biodiesel prepared from anchovy fish discards and its different blends (25:75, 50:50, 75:25) with petroleum diesel was studied by Behcet (2011) and deduced that biodiesel prepared from the discards of anchovy could replace petroleum diesel in its engine. Furthermore, it was found that using fish oil biodiesel led to a significant reduction in CO2, CO, and hydrocarbons by 4.57%, 21.3%, 33.42%, respectively, when compared to standard diesel."
24,Biogas,"Apart from biodiesel, fish processing waste can also be used in the production of biogas. Although a considerable amount of work has been carried out in biodiesel production, comparatively less work is carried out on biogas production. For the production of biogas, fish waste free of oil (cake) can be used. Along with oil-free fish waste, manure and sewage sludge could also be utilized. The digestate obtained after anaerobic digestion can be used as fertilizer (Yuvraj et al., 2016). For the treatment of solid waste anaerobic digestion is a potential technique. The energy from biogas produced by anaerobic digestion can be ideal in minimizing the global warming and greenhouse gases and thereby forming a substitute for energy derived from fossil fuels (Eiroa et al., 2012). Fish waste biogas comprises of 50–75% methane and 25–50% carbon dioxide. Other gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia are present in trace quantities (Yuvraj et al., 2016). Eiroa et al. (2012) evaluated the potential of biomethane produced from wastes of different fishes and obtained biomethane production of 0.47 g COD-CH4/g CODadded from solid waste of tuna fish, sardine fish and needlefish and production of 0.59 g COD-CH4/g CODadded from wastes derived from mackerel fish. The work carried out on biogas production from fish discards are limited, so still a lot of works need to be carried out on biogas production from composite fish discards and its composition."
25,Glycerine by-product economy,"Glycerine or glycerol is the major by-product obtained during biodiesel production via transesterification reaction (Moser, 2009). Apart from transesterification, crude glycerol is also obtained as a by-product of saponification and hydrolysis reactions. The glycerol thus obtained is impure and contains alcohol, ash, spent catalyst, fatty acid, and waster as impurities. The presence of these impurities alters the physical properties of crude glycerol. The crude glycerol obtained from the transesterification reaction comprises 60–70% (wt) of glycerol. Furthermore, purified glycerol has several applications in industries and is used as the main feedstock in cosmetic, drug as well as food industries. Crude glycerol has limited industrial applications (Tan et al., 2013). Several works have been carried out on the utilization of unrefined glycerol. These studies have concentrated primarily on hydrogen production, ethanol or methanol production, additives for automotive fuels, etc. Other potential application of unrefined glycerol includes animal feed production, co-gasification and co-digestion, and waste treatment (Leoneti et al., 2012). Different methods such as distillation, activated carbon adsorption, chemical treatment, ion-exchange using resin, decantation, extraction, and crystallography have been used to purify glycerol. Currently, the market for glycerol is limited and cannot accommodate the excess glycerol generated from biodiesel production. Hence new applications such as the conversion of glycerol to the value-added product need to be explored (Tan et al., 2013)."
26,Fish oil as a feedstock for jet fuel,"Jet fuel or aviation turbine fuel is an aviation fuel, mainly used in aircraft powered by gas turbine engines. The commonly used jet fuels are Jet A and Jet A1 for commercial aviation. Air vehicles contribute to ∼2% of CO2 emissions, and this is expected to reach 3% in 2050. Out of the total operational cost, commercial airliners face the cost of aviation fuel as a major expenditure. The aviation sector fuels need to have good thermal stability and flow characteristics and high energy content. Non-edible oils including jatropha, camelina, algal oil, municipal and sewage waste, halophytes, forest residues have been used in the aviation fuel production process (Yilmaz and Atmanli, 2017). In order for biomass-based oil to be used in the aviation sector, the properties of oil derived from biomass must be similar to the properties of jet fuel. There are various methods for aviation fuel conversion and production. The aviation or jet fuel can be produced from sugars (fermentation of sugars to hydrocarbons), alcohol (butanol or ethanol), gas (Fischer Tropsch process), and oil (HEFA). Some of the important properties exhibited by jet fuel include 8 mm2/s kinematic viscosity at 40 °C, the density of 0.775–0.84 g/ml at 20 °C, flash point of 38 °C, the heating value of 42.80–43.02 MJ/kg, the freezing point of −47 to −60 °C, the boiling point of 150–170 °C and the auto ignition temperature of 210 °C (Yilmaz and Atmanli, 2017). Lin and Li (2009) prepared biodiesel from the discards of marine fishes and determined its properties. The marine fish oil biodiesel showed viscosity, flash point, and heating value of 7.2 mm2/s at 40 °C, 103 °C and 41.37 MJ/kg, respectively. Further, the biodiesel exhibited 0.78 wt% carbon residue and 7.19 wt% element O. The similarity in some of the properties hints that fish oil could be utilized as raw material for the preparation of biojet fuel. Moreover, further work has to be carried out in evaluating other combustion properties of fish discard biodiesel, especially octane number, and also their blends with aviation fuel. In India, SpiceJet is the first airline company to operate the first biofuel powered aircraft- Bombardier Q400 from Dehra Dun to Delhi. The aircraft was powered by biojet fuel prepared from the jatropha plant. The blend of 25% biojet fuel and 75% aviation turbine fuel was filled in the right aircraft of the engine. The biojet fuel was produced by CSIR-IIP (Indian Institute of Petroleum), Dehra Dun. Recently, the Indian Air Force (IAF) flew an aircraft using blended biojet fuel. The aircraft used was Russian origin transport plane AN-32, and 10% biojet fuel blend was filled in the engine."
27,"Advantages, drawbacks, and prospects","The prime challenges in the production of biodiesel include the availability of feedstock throughout the year, availability of feedstock across the globe, varying fatty acid composition, storage stability, and cost of the feedstock. Most of the biofuel feedstocks pose several hurdles for its utilization in the preparation of biodiesel. Thus, it is necessary to find feedstock from a possible waste source with an advantage over currently used feedstocks. Fish is consumed by most of the people across the globe with the generation of the tremendous amount of fish waste, which can be exploited to overcome the hurdles in the production of biodiesel through other feedstocks. Fish waste promises to be sustainable feedstock also can reduce the cost of biodiesel production. It is available all across the globe. India itself generates more than 4 million metric tonnes of fish waste, and at a global level, the amount of fish waste produced can be up to billion metric tonnes. During the extraction of oil from processes such as wet rendering methods, the protein hydrolyzates produced can be utilized for the production of animal feed. The biodiesel production from fish waste can be carried out by various techniques such as microwave assisted transesterification reaction, ultrasound assisted transesterification reaction, acid catalyzed transesterification reaction, base catalyzed transesterification reaction, and enzyme catalyzed transesterification reaction. However, some of these techniques hold the drawback. Microwave assisted transesterification reaction cannot be carried out on a large scale. Thus, this technique needs to overcome a barrier to be performed on a large scale. The best technique which can be employed is an ultrasound assisted transesterification reaction since acid catalyzed transesterification reaction is slow, and saponification can be observed in alkali catalyzed transesterification reaction. Moreover, the production of biodiesel from transesterification doesn’t make use of scales, bones, etc., but these can be utilized for the production of chemical catalysts such as CaO, hydroxyapatite, etc., and can be employed in the production of biodiesel. The production of these catalysts is cheap since the production employs only heating, and the catalysts are reusable. This reduces the biodiesel production price furthermore. Besides, the price of biodiesel can be reduced if the enzyme (lipase) is immobilized in enzyme catalyzed transesterification reaction. Till now, no efficient lipase has been discovered with maximum reusability. Moreover, some sources are yet to be explored. Fish viscera can also form the source of lipase. But there are hardly a few works carried out on fish visceral lipase on biodiesel production. Henceforth, finding an efficient lipase with more reproducibility from marine sources can be one of challenges. The other challenge includes enhancing the storage stability of biodiesel. At present, synthetic anti-oxidants are employed to enhance storage stability, but there is a need to come out with an alternative. Overall, we can say that it is possible to utilize the entire fish processing discards for the production of biofuels, the visceral organs can be exploited for fish oil and lipase (biocatalyst), bones, scales, etc., can be used to produce reusable chemical catalysts and by-products generated during the extraction of oil and transesterification process holds demand in the industry. Thus, the problems caused by fish processing discards can be avoided if it is employed for bioenergy production thereby reducing pollution and energy crisis."
28,Discussion,"Fish is consumed globally. In the last decade, there has been a considerable increase in global fish production. With the increase in global fish production, there will also be an increased production of fish discards. Globally ∼90 million tonnes of fish discard is produced every year. Currently, some part of the fish discards are used to prepare animal feed or fertilizer, but the major bulk, thus are simply dumped to water bodies or landfills which have led to negative impact on the environment. These fish discards could be an excellent source of lipid/oil. The oil extracted from fish discards could be used for the production of biodiesel. The biodiesel prepared from fish discard oil could be cheap and help to overcome the drawbacks of the other biodiesel feedstocks such as vegetable oil, used cooking oil, animal fats, etc. However, the fatty acid profile or lipid composition of fish discards is not uniform throughout the year in fish discards. The fatty acid and lipid composition of fish vary from seasonally. Thus the biodiesel produced from the fish discards would not be of same quality always. Moreover, fish discards cannot be relied as the only feedstock for the production of biodiesel in the future. The amount of biodiesel produced only from fish discards may not be able to reach the country’s demand, but it could be used as feedstock alongside other feedstocks such as vegetable oil, waste cooking oil, and animal fats. The production of biofuel (biodiesel) as an integrated approach with fish farming or fish processing would be an ideal integrated system. This integrated system has not been used due to limited knowledge in this aspect. This would result in simultaneous production of fish discards as well as biodiesel production. The biodiesel produced can be used in a motor powered boat or in to diesel powered machineries employed in fish processing industries. This approach could provide additional income to fishing farmers’ community and also generate employment. Thus, the production of biodiesel at commercial level would be more beneficial with integrated approach. At present, base catalyzed transesterification is the most preferred technique to produce biodiesel since it could be carried out at low temperature and in a short duration. Moreover, other techniques have certain flaws in its application in commercial production of biodiesel. The by-product glycerol produced during the production of biodiesel also has extensive demand in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. Further, the properties of biodiesel prepared from fish discards of certain fishes were found to be feasible and ideal to be used as a substitute to petrodiesel as per international standards. The application of fish oil extracted from discards in the production of biojet fuel is still not studied. Furthermore, the fish discards generated from the fish market could also be used for the production biogas, but still a lot of work needs to be carried out in this aspect."
29,Conclusion,"There are various hurdles in the production of biodiesel, but fish discards can overcome most of it and prove itself as a promising cheap feedstock for biodiesel production. Amongst the various techniques used for the transesterification reaction, maximum biodiesel yield from fish discard oil in a short duration was obtained from base catalyzed transesterification and is the widely preferred process for commercial biodiesel preparation from fish oil. The lipase from fish viscera and heterogeneous catalysts derived from fish bones and scales might also be employed for biodiesel production, provided these catalysts possess maximum reusability. Hence, a holistic approach to the utilization of fish discards for biodiesel production would definitely benefit both industries as well fish marketing centers by minimizing its disposal and using it for producing biodiesel, which can substitute diesel by itself. This approach would also help in achieving sustainability by reducing environmental pollution and overcome the energy crisis. Research still needs to focus on improving the storage stability of biodiesel produced not only from fish waste oil, but also from other cheap feedstocks such as waste cooking oil, animal fats, etc."
