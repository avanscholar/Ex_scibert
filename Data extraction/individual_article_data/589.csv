0,Introduction,"Wild forest fires affect 300–460 million ha of forested areas per year worldwide, thereby emitting nearly 1.6–2.8 Gt atmospheric carbon (Santín et al., 2016). This is equivalent to 25–30% of the yearly carbon emission derived from fossil fuel combustion (Van Der Werf et al., 2010). Wildfires can drastically alter the surrounding ecosystems and wildlife habitats including vegetation, composition, canopy and structure of a forest. While most wildfires occur naturally affecting areas of combustible vegetation, some human-caused wildfires also result from unattended campfires, discarded cigarettes or combustible materials, downed power lines or deliberate acts of arson (Insurance Information Institute, Inc., 2020). On the contrary, thunder strikes, lightning, lava and spontaneous combustion of dry fuels are also considered the natural means of wildfires. Conversely, forest fires can also occur intentionally under controlled of prescribed conditions for forest management practices, restoration of prairies and forest heterogeneity and greenhouse gas abatement (Knapp et al., 2017). Over a long-term period, a forest fire event is considered as a carbon-neutral process because the carbon released from fires as gaseous emissions and charred wood is balanced by the carbon intake from the regenerating vegetation (excluding peatlands and deforestation) (Knicker et al., 2005; Bowman et al., 2009; Van Der Werf et al., 2010). In some scenarios, carbon neutrality appears to be flawed as it does not consider the influence of pyrogenic carbon (Van Der Werf et al., 2010). The advent of climate change, global warming and shift in weather patterns are expected to increase the frequency of forest fires on a global scale. According to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), about 50,477 incidents of wildfires occurred in the U.S. in 2019 with the most cases reported in California, Texas, Colorado and Arizona among other states, which affected nearly 4.7 million acres of forested areas in the entire country (Insurance Information Institute, Inc., 2020). With 9% of the world’s forests (347 million ha) (Natural Resources Canada, 2020), Canada reports approximately 8000 wildfires annually with an average burnt area of 2.5 million ha/year (Government of Canada, 2020). In Canada, British Columbia and the Boreal forested areas in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as well as the Yukon and Northwest Territories, are the regions with the highest wildfire occurrences. The recent devastating wildfire in Canada occurred in summer 2016 in Fort McMurray, Alberta destroying nearly 600,000 ha of forests (CBC, 2016). In 2017, the deadliest forest fire raged the Northern California scorching approximately 99,148 ha causing damage to property, person and wildlife (Reuters, 2018). Most recently, one of the worst forest fires occurring in decades has ravaged Australia destroying about 7.3 million ha of land spurring across six states with New South Wales accounting for 4.9 million ha of the burnt land alone (CNN, 2020). During the preparation of this article, more than 300 ha of forested area in Similipal biosphere reserve was on fire in Odisha, India (Azad and Pradhan, 2021). Being the seventh-largest national park in India and part of the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves, Similipal biosphere reserve covers over 2750 km2 and is home to the Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, other wildlife and rare medicinal plants (Press Trust of India, 2021). Although forest fires release a significant level of pollutants (e.g., CO2 and NOx) and fine particles that have the potential to cause adverse health effects, they also generate a considerable amount of completely burnt wood (e.g., charred wood) and partially burnt wood (e.g., torrefied wood). During a forest fire, there is usually an incomplete burning of plant materials and trees, which convert them into pyrolytic carbon or torrefied solids. A large diversity of forest vegetation together with heterogeneous burning conditions makes it highly challenging to utilize partially burnt wood (PBW). Although the charred materials can restore the carbon in the soil, it remains a challenge to utilize PBW, as they are prone to slower degradation rates due to the fractional loss of organic matter (Knicker et al., 2005; Bowman et al., 2009; Van Der Werf et al., 2010; Santín et al., 2016). This study intends to identify the usage of PBW as an alternate feedstock for biofuel production. Because of the dwindling fossil fuel reserves and the environmental challenges posed by their overwhelming consumption, it is imperative to search for alternative energy sources (Nanda et al., 2015a). Such renewable energy sources should be environmentally benign and sustainable to meet the present and future energy demands of the world’s rising population. Hydrogen (H2) stands out as an efficient energy carrier that can either be used directly as a direct fuel or transformed into liquid transportation fuels and chemicals via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (Okolie et al., 2019). Furthermore, the burning of H2 produces water without releasing any toxic substances. The prospect of H2 utilization as the next generation of advanced fuels and energy carriers such as fuel cells has gained momentum recently (Nanda et al., 2017b). Furthermore, the utilization of H2 can be extended to heavy oil upgrading (e.g., hydrotreating), metal reduction and the production of aviation fuels. Hydrogen can be produced from several thermochemical, biological, photocatalytic and electrochemical routes (Nanda et al., 2017b). Among all the thermochemical conversion pathways for H2 production, hydrothermal gasification is gaining immense attention as an effective method to convert biomass and waste materials into sustainable fuels under aqueous conditions, thus saving the cost of biomass drying. Hydrothermal gasification utilizes the unique properties of water under subcritical conditions (temperature < 374 °C and pressure < 22.1 MPa) and supercritical conditions (temperature > 374 °C and pressure > 22.1 MPa) to convert biomass into H2-rich syngas. It should be noted that the thermophysical properties of water are influenced by its temperature and pressure beyond the critical value (T c = 374 °C and P c = 22.1 MPa). Water at the supercritical phase shows liquid-like density and gas-like viscosity, which facilitates its ability to dissolve robust organic compounds (Reddy et al., 2014). Furthermore, the absence of phase boundaries under supercritical conditions leads to increased occurrence of homogeneous reactions containing organic compounds while non-polar compounds and salts can be removed easily from the reaction products (Nanda et al., 2017a). Other than its ability to convert a wide variety of feedstocks with high moisture content into hydrogen-rich gases without drying, hydrothermal gasification (also known as supercritical water gasification or SCWG) exhibits several other advantages over conventional thermochemical gasification (Aziz, 2015; Mian et al., 2015). The unique properties of water ensure that the production of undesired products such as char and tar are minimized. These products, peculiar to conventional gasification, can create technical problems during processing and maintenance leading to loss of efficiency (Okolie et al., 2020a). Furthermore, inorganic salts are easily separated from the reaction products during SCWG (Okolie et al., 2020b). The high pressures used during the SCWG process also ensures that the produced syngas can be stored directly without adding external pressure to the system (Kang et al., 2017a). A plethora of research has been done to investigate the production of H2-rich syngas through subcritical and supercritical water gasification of different biomass model compounds such as cellulose and real biomass feedstocks, hemicellulose, lignin, energy crops, agricultural crop residues, food waste, sewage sludge, cattle manure, waste tires, crude oils and petrochemical residues (Okolie et al., 2020a). A few studies have also evaluated the kinetics and thermodynamic analyses of the hydrothermal gasification process (Withag et al., 2012; Yakaboylu et al., 2013; Adamu et al., 2017; Castello et al., 2013; Okolie et al., 2020b). Yakaboylu et al. (2013) have studied the equilibrium partitioning of several elements based on the presence of different compounds and phases during the subcritical and supercritical water gasification of mixed pig–cow manure at 100–580 °C under 24 MPa pressure. The gaseous products obtained at equilibrium conditions include CO2, CH4, N2, H2 and H2O. Adamu et al. (2017) have shown that the addition of La on Ni/La–Al2O3 catalysts during the gasification of glucose in SCW led to an increase in gas yield towards the equilibrium value. Moreover, the authors have also reported that pressure change had little effect on the process while an elevation in water-to-glucose ratio from 6 to 9 resulted in a rise in H2/CO ratio from 3.2 to 4.7. Recently, Okolie et al. (2020b) have demonstrated that soybean straw and flax straw are feasible feedstock for hydrogen-rich gas production via SCWG technology. Castello et al. (2014) have explored the possibility of using hydrochar from hydrothermal carbonization as feedstock for the SCWG process. One of the objectives of the study was to evaluate the possibilities of coupling hydrothermal carbonization with SCWG. Their findings showed that hydrochar could be a possible feed for the SCWG process. The hydrothermal treatment has been proven to improve biomass properties for gasification or combustion processes. Monedero et al. (2019) have characterized several biomass residues before and after hydrothermal carbonization. When compared with the original biomass residues, the produced hydrochar showed higher carbon content, higher heating value and low ash content. Firewood from forest fires represents a carbon-rich material like that of hydrochar. Burnt wood from forest fires obtained from different geographical locations could exhibit variable physicochemical properties based on the sources of plant residues (e.g., herbaceous or woody biomass), biomass composition and properties, local climatic conditions and the intensity of a wildfire, to name a few. Therefore, the gas yields obtained from PBW collected from various sources could largely differ. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no reports are available on the evaluation of the applicability of partially burnt wood obtained from forest fires for H2 production through hydrothermal gasification. With this objective, hydrothermal gasification of this novel feedstock was performed under subcritical and supercritical conditions. A thorough investigation of the effects of process parameters such as temperature, feed concentration, residence time and biomass particle size were carried out in this study. Understanding the effects of these parameters is important for the optimization of process parameters and reaction mechanisms, improving product yields, process scale-up as well as techno-economic and lifecycle assessments. Another novelty of this study is the use of the Taguchi experimental design method to investigate the relative influence of process parameters. Taguchi’s parameter design technique provides a systematic and simple approach to optimize the performance, cost and quality of a process (Ghani et al., 2004). It is expected that the observations from SCWG of PBW could provide insights into the valorization of this underutilized carbonaceous material for hydrogen production. Furthermore, the high carbon and energy content of PBW in comparison to raw lignocellulosic biomass suggests its candidacy as a promising feedstock for thermochemical or hydrothermal conversion processes."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feedstock,"2.1 Feedstock Substantial amounts of partially burnt wood (PBW) in chunks were collected in the aftermath of the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire incident in Alberta, Canada. After collection, the PBW chunks were air-dried for two weeks followed by brushing to remove any sand, silt and dust particles. The air-dried PBW chunks were pulverized in an IKA MF 10 Basic S1 grinder (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc., Mississauga, Canada). Two different particle sizes were obtained such as 0.13 mm (Size A) and 0.8 mm (Size B). Pinewood biomass, obtained locally from a forest in Saskatoon, was used as a model raw/unburnt woody biomass for comparison with PBW in terms of some selected physicochemical characterizations."
3,Hydrothermal gasification,"2.2 Hydrothermal gasification Subcritical and supercritical water gasification of PBW was performed under batch mode using a fixed-bed gasifier. The gasifier consisted of a tubular reactor with a length of 400 mm long, an inner and outer diameter of 9 mm and 13 mm, respectively. The gasifier reactor was made of stainless steel (SS316). The SS316 material was purchased from Swagelok (Swagelok Central Ontario, Mississauga, Canada). The reactor schematics together with its several components is shown in Fig. 1 (Okolie et al., 2020c). Additionally, the reactor assembly consisted of an ATS Series 3210 furnace (Applied Test Systems, Butler, USA) housing the tubular gasifier reactor and regulated by an ATS Type-K temperature controller system. Other components include a moisture trap (Praxair Canada Inc., Mississauga, Canada), Omega type-K thermocouple (Spectris Canada, Inc., Laval, Canada), pressure relief valves, pressure gauges, check valves and 2-μm filters purchased from Swagelok (Swagelok Central Ontario Mississauga, Canada). Before starting the experiment, the reactor assembly was purged with N2 gas to remove any traces of air and create an inert atmosphere. The feedstock (PBW) and deionized water mixture were fed into the gasifier reactor based on the desired feed concentration (10–20 wt%). Later, the gasification system was sealed and pressurized with N2 to an initial pressure of 5–10 MPa based on the desired reaction temperature. The tubular gasifier reactor was heated using the ATS Series 3210 furnace connected to the ATS Type-K temperature control system. Omega Type-K thermocouples continuously recorded the temperature inside the reactor. After the subcritical and supercritical test temperatures were attained (300–500 °C) under pressures of 23–25 MPa at a fixed heating rate of 30 °C/min, the reaction was performed at various residence times of 15–45 min using two different biomass particle sizes of 0.13 mm and 0.8 mm. After completion of the gasification reaction, the furnace was switched off and sprayed with chilled water. The water spraying helped with the cooling of the hot reactor. The gaseous products, vapors and volatiles passed through the gas-liquid separating cylinder for condensation. The non-condensable permanent gases passed through a moisture trap and subsequently collected in a Tedlar bag (Environmental Sampling Supply, San Leandro, USA) for gas chromatography (GC) analysis. The liquid samples were collected at the bottom of the gas-liquid separator for further analysis. Finally, the solid products (hydrochar) were recovered immediately after cooling the reactor."
4,Gas phase analysis,"2.3 Gas phase analysis The gases generated from the hydrothermal gasification of PBW were analyzed with an Agilent GC 7820 A gas chromatography system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). The GC, which was equipped with packed columns, capillary column and thermal conductivity detector, used argon as the carrier gas. The detector and column temperature of the column and detector were maintained at 50 °C and 60 °C, respectively. Gaseous products such as H2, CO and CH4 were identified with the Ultimetal Hayesep QT 80/100 mesh column while the Ultimetal Hayesep T 80/100 mesh column was used to evaluate the concentration of gaseous products such as C2–C4, CO2 and hydrocarbons. The hydrothermal gasification of PBW-derived gas products was reported as millimoles of each gas per gram of feedstock (mmol/g) (Nanda et al., 2017a). The total gas yield was calculated as the overall yields of each gas produced, also expressed in mmol/g. H2 selectivity (Seif et al., 2015) and lower heating value (Lv et al., 2004) of the gas products were calculated using Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), respectively. The carbon gasification efficiency was calculated using Eq. (3). Hydrogen selectivity (HS): (1) HS ( % ) = Moles of H 2 Sum of moles of CO , CO 2 , CH 4 and C 1 − C 4 Lower heating value (LHV): (2) LHV ( kJ / Nm 3 ) = 4.2 × ( 30.3 × CO + 25.8 × H 2 + 85.4 × CH 4 + 151.3 × C n H m ) Carbon gasification efficiency (CGE): (3) CGE ( % ) = Sum of the number of moles of carbon in the gaseous product Number of moles of carbon in the feedstock"
5,Feedstock and hydrochar characterization,"2.4 Feedstock and hydrochar characterization The proximate analysis of PBW and its hydrochars was performed to determine the moisture content, volatile matter and ash contents by following the standard ASTM procedures (ASTM E871-82, 2006; ASTM E1755-01, 2007; ASTM D3175-11, 2011). To determine the amount of moisture, about 1 g of PBW was placed in a crucible. After which the crucible was transferred inside a muffle furnace where it is heated for 2 h at a temperature of 105 ± 3 °C. The difference in the weight before and after heating the sample indicates the moisture content. Similarly, the ash and volatile matter were determined by weight differences. However, the samples were heated at 575 ± 10 °C for 4 h and 950 ± 10 °C for 7 min for the determination of ash content and volatile matter, respectively. Fixed carbon was calculated as the difference of moisture, volatile matter and ash. The ultimate analysis of PBW and its hydrochars was performed using an Elementar Vario EL III CHNS analyzer (Elementar Analysensysteme, Hanau, Germany). Oxygen (O) content was calculated as the difference of to measure the amount of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) and ash. The higher heating value (HHV) of PBW was calculated from using Friedl’s formula as follows (Eq. (4)) (Friedl et al., 2005): Friedl’s formula: (4) HHV ( KJ / kg ) = ( 3.55 × C 2 ) − ( 232 × C ) − ( 2230 × H ) + ( 51.2 × C × H ) + ( 131 × N ) + 20600 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of PBW was performed by using a TGA Q500 instrument (TA Instruments – Waters LLC, New Castle, USA). The analysis was performed to understand the devolatilization behavior of PBW compared to unburnt woody biomass. To conduct the TGA measurements, the biomass samples were heated up to 850 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min under an N2 atmosphere with a flow rate of 60 mL/min. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of PBW and its hydrochar was performed to qualitatively identify the presence of organic functional groups using a Bruker VERTEX 70v FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics Ltd, Milton, Canada). The infrared spectra were obtained in the range of 500–3500 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and an average of 64 scans. PBW biomass and its hydrochar were also analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using an FEI Quanta 3D FEG DualBeam microscope (FEI Company, Hillsboro, USA) operated at 20 kV voltage under high vacuum mode. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the liquid effluents obtained from hydrothermal gasification of PBW was carried out to identify their organic composition. The analysis was performed with a TSQ Duo Mass Spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The temperature and the carrier gas (helium) flow rate were set to 250 °C and 1.2 mL/min, respectively. The test samples for analysis were prepared by dissolving each liquid effluent with acetone (1:10 vol/vol). About 1 μL of the prepared sample solution was meticulously injected into the system with the initial oven temperature set at 40 °C for a minute holding time. The split flow was set to 60 mL/min while the split ratio was at 50:1. After the sample injection, the temperature was programmed with an initial elevation up to 150 °C using a flow rate of 5 °C/min followed by a final temperature of 320 °C at 10 °C/min heating rate with a holding time of 5 min. The mass spectra information of liquid effluents was obtained at 50–650 m/z with the peaks compared against a standard NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) library. Chromeleon™ 7.2 Chromatography Data System software was used for the analysis."
6,Taguchi experimental design method,"2.5 Taguchi experimental design method The design of experiment (DOE) based on the Taguchi optimization method was used in this study. The Taguchi method is an experimental design approach that is adapted to minimize the total number of experiments while providing accuracy and consistency to the process. It is a factorial-based method that uses the orthogonal array (series of experiments under different situations) to study the influence of different factors (variables) on the response. Furthermore, with the orthogonal array, the process parameters can be optimized with a minimum number of experimental runs. The use of orthogonal arrays reduces errors and improves the efficiency and reproducibility of the experimental results (Kang et al., 2016, 2017). In the Taguchi design of experiments, the outer and inner orthogonal arrays have been considered to reduce the noise factors in physical experiments conducted. At the central point, several experiments were carried out to determine the mean and standard deviation (<4%). The study intended to understand the effect of the controllable (independent) factors on the response rather than noise limitations. The performance of the process in the Taguchi method is determined by the deviation of a feature from its target value and a loss function [L(y)] resulting from the statistics (Mohan et al., 2007). The loss function [L(y)] can be represented through Eq. (5): (5) L ( y ) = k × ( y − m ) 2 where ‘k’ and ‘y’ denote the average loss coefficient and the experiment obtained from each experimental run, respectively. On the other hand, ‘m’ represents the target response (Liao and Kao, 2010). The value assigned to the loss function is further transformed into a parameter known as the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) (Nalbant et al., 2007). The S/N ratio is defined by Taguchi as the ratio of the mean value of quality characteristics of the response to the corresponding standard deviation. It can be used to determine the level of each factor that would optimize the response (H2 yield in this study). It should be noted that the S/N ratio cannot predict the extent to which each process parameter affects the response (Mia and Dhar, 2017). Therefore, combining both S/N analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) could help to determine the optimum conditions for the process. Moreover, the S/N ratio helps to enhance the quality performance in two phases to lower variability and refine the mean measurements (Nalbant et al., 2007). Three different categories for continuous function characteristics used in the S/N ratio analysis are expressed in Eqs. (6)–(8) (Mia and Dhar, 2017): When nominal is the best: (6) S N B = 10 Log Y ¯ S Y 2 When larger is the better: (7) S N L = − 10 Log ( 1 n ∑ i = 1 n 1 y i 2 ) When smaller is the better: (8) S N S = − 10 Log ( 1 n ∑ i = 1 n y i 2 ) where, ‘ Y ¯ ’ represents the mean values of the observed data, and ‘n’ and ‘y’ denote the number of observations and the observed data, respectively. S/N represents the signal to noise ratios while the subscript at the denominator indicates whether nominal is the best ( S N B ) , larger is the better ( S N B ) or smaller is the better ( S N S ) . The subscript “i” refers to i-th value out of the sample size “n”. The variance of ‘y’ is represented with ‘Sy’ in this study. The fitness, also known as the objective function, evaluates the fitness of each solution. A fitness value is assigned to every individual in the population. The problem fitness function is obtained through the first-order derivative of the regression analysis. The Taguchi design methodology used in this study is divided into four distinct phases, each with different steps as summarized in Fig. 2 . Although each phase has a separate objective, it is well connected sequentially to achieve the overall aim of optimizing the process parameters. In this work, we attempt to apply the Taguchi methodology in optimizing the process parameters used in hydrothermal gasification of waste residues (PBW in this case). The parameters selected include the temperature, residence time, feed concentration and particle size. Although pressure is another process parameter for consideration, most reports indicate minimal variations in the gas yields during SCWG of biomass beyond 23–25 MPa (Byrd et al., 2007; Kang et al., 2015). The selection of the range of operating values for each process parameter was based on experimental observations in the literature, the critical point of water and the results from our previous studies. For example, the temperature range used in this study is 300–500 °C, since the critical temperature of the water is 374.1 °C, the lower temperature limit was set at a value slightly below the critical temperature. The upper limit temperature was set at 500 °C because temperatures above the critical point could theoretically lead to improved gas yield. However, employing higher temperatures (>500 °C) could also lead to additional energy input and operating costs for heating. On the other hand, safety issues, the durability of reactor materials and reactor corrosion are also a concern at higher SCW temperatures. The biomass particle size of 0.13 mm (Size A) and 0.8 mm (Size B) as well as the feed concentration range of 10–20 wt% were selected based on our previous study on SCWG of soybean straw and flax straw (Okolie et al., 2020b). Longer residence time could favor gas yields but might involve maintaining higher temperatures for a longer duration posing the aforementioned challenges. Moreover, our previous studies reveal that a residence time of more than 45 min tends to decrease H2 yields due to hydrogenation and methanation (Okolie et al., 2020b). Therefore, the upper limit of residence time was set at 45 min. The first step in Phase 1 involves the identification of important process parameters such as temperature, particle size, residence time and feed concentration whose variation impacts the H2 yield (response). In the second step, the factor level was determined as illustrated in Table 1 . Three levels were used in this study. After identifying the factors and levels, the experimental matrix, and the procedure for analyzing data were identified. The L18 Taguchi design consisting of 21 × 33 orthogonal arrays was employed in this study (Table 1). The design is a combination of three-level, three factors design, and a one-factor two-level design as shown in Table 2 . A total number of 18 experiments were required based on the Taguchi design matrix to perform the hydrothermal gasification of PBW. The response was H2 yield in mmol/g of PBW, and total gas yield expressed in the same unit. In the third phase, the experimental results were analyzed with the help of Minitab® Statistical Software version 16 (Minitab, LLC, State College, PA, USA) to study the effect of factors and their interactions on the response followed by the determination of the optimum conditions for each level and the overall process optimization. In the final phase, another set of experiments was performed at the optimum level conditions to validate the experimental methods."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of PBW biomass and hydrochar,"3.1 Characterization of PBW biomass and hydrochar The proximate and ultimate analyses of PBW feedstock are illustrated in Table 3 . PBW had a relatively high concentration of carbon (85 wt%), oxygen (10.8 wt%) and hydrogen (3.7 wt%). Additionally, PBW exhibits relatively low H/C and O/C atomic ratios of 0.5 and 0.1, respectively. The empirical formula of PBW derived from the H/C, O/C, N/C and S/C atomic ratios is CH0.5O0.1N0.004S0.0004. PBW also revealed an HHV of 34.5 MJ/kg. The moisture, ash and volatile matter of PBW were found to be 3.1 wt%, 1.6 wt% and 21.9 wt%, respectively. A rise in temperature from 300 °C to 500 °C resulted in an elevation in the fixed carbon content and ash contents of the hydrochar samples (Table 3). On the contrary, the moisture and volatile matter declined with a temperature rise. During hydrothermal gasification at high temperatures, PBW undergoes dehydration, decomposition and thermal cracking causing the removal of volatile matter from the feedstock. The carbon content of the hydrochar samples at different temperatures was in the order: Hydrochar-300 °C (88.9 wt%) < Hydrochar-400 °C (90.4 wt%) < Hydrochar-500 °C (91 wt%). The hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen contents of the hydrochar samples decreased with an elevation in the temperature. Increasing the gasification temperature from 300 °C to 500 °C led to an elevation in the HHV of PBW hydrochar samples as follows: PBW (34.5 MJ/kg) < Hydrochar-300 °C (35.7 MJ/kg) < 400 °C (36.4 MJ/kg) < 500 °C (38.6 MJ/kg). The superior HHV of hydrochar samples generated at higher temperatures could be because of the augmentation of carbon contents. Fig. 3 illustrates the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of PBW and raw/unburnt pinewood. The devolatilization pattern of PBW reveals a visible mass loss at a temperature below 180 °C due to the dehumidification process leading to the loss in moisture contents of PBW. In contrast, a distinctive thermogram was observed for raw pinewood with mass loss starting at 200 °C, which could be because of cellulose and hemicellulose degradation. The maximum weight loss for PBW was found at temperatures between 400 °C and 800 °C, which suggested the removal of lignin and residual organic components. In the case of raw/untreated biomass, cellulose and hemicellulose are reported to decompose at 100–290 °C and 200–400 °C, respectively (Yang et al., 2007; Azargohar et al., 2014). On the other hand, lignin degrades at temperatures above 400 °C. The final weight loss in PBW at 700 °C was approximately 20%. The FTIR spectrum of PBW is shown in Fig. 4 . The FTIR spectrum denotes the presence of several aromatic groups and different oxygen-containing functional groups in PBW. The aromatic functional groups are found between 500 cm−1 and 900 cm−1 (Nanda et al., 2016). On the other hand, oxygen-containing functional groups occur at peaks ranging from 1000 to 1800 cm−1. These peaks contain compounds having the CO functional groups such as esters, carboxylic acids, ketones and anhydrides (Chia et al., 2012). Aliphatic stretching of C–H groups occurs between 2300 and 3000 cm−1 (Uzi et al., 2016). The peaks observed at 592 cm−1 in PBW could be attributed to the C–C aromatic structures (Nanda et al., 2016). The peaks at 747 cm−1, 813 cm−1 and 870 cm−1 are due to C–H aromatic structures. The peaks at 1574 cm−1 and 1692 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching of C–C bonds in aromatic rings and the stretching of CO bond in aldehyde, ketones, esters and carboxylic acids (Nanda et al., 2013). The FTIR analysis of PBW and its hydrochar samples generated at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 4. A few peaks previously present in PBW lost their intensities in the hydrochar samples with an increase in temperature. Some of those peaks include the peaks ranging from 1000 cm−1 to 1800 cm−1, which belonged to oxygen-containing functional groups such as esters, carboxylic acids, ketones and anhydrides. Besides, the peaks between 2300 cm−1 and 3000 cm−1, which belonged to the aliphatic groups also lost their intensities and gradually disappeared at higher temperatures. The removal of these organic components could be attributed to the dehydration of organic functional groups because of the increased hydrothermal gasification temperatures. Significant intensification of peaks at 540 cm−1 and 895 cm−1 in the hydrochar samples were noticed. These peaks were attributed to the C–C and C–H aromatic structures due to the aromatization of hydrochar at high temperatures. The SEM images of PBW and its hydrochar samples are presented in Fig. 5 . From the SEM images, it is evident that the surface structure of PBW is intact and well preserved in comparison to its hydrochar. However, a significant degradation is observed in the hydrochar at 500 °C compared to that of 300 °C and PBW biomass. The degradation of the hydrochar surface suggests the loss of organic compounds at high-temperature hydrothermal gasification. This observation corroborates well with the FTIR results. Therefore, it can be inferred that high-temperature SCWG favors the conversion of PBW to gaseous products and aromatic hydrochar with a loss in their structural integrity."
9,Analysis of experimental results,"3.2 Analysis of experimental results The H2 yields and total gas yields (response) obtained after performing hydrothermal gasification experiments at different factors and the level combination is presented in Table 2. All the experiments were carried out a minimum number of three times with the average values reported. Moreover, the standard deviation of all values is less than 3%. As seen in Table 2, the highest H2 yield and overall total gas yield of 5.26 mmol/g and 11.9 mmol/g, respectively were obtained with Exp. #9 (biomass particle size A: 0.13 mm; temperature: 500 °C, residence time: 45 min and feed concentration: 10 wt%). Additionally, the lowest H2 yield of 0.04 mmol/g and total gas yields of 0.55 mmol/g were determined from Exp. #10 (biomass particle size B: 0.8 mm, temperature: 300 °C, residence time: 15 min and feed concentration: 20 wt%). On the other hand, the highest CGE of 74.1% was obtained with Exp. #9 while the minimum CGE was 8.3% (Exp. #10). With all the parameters constant, an increase in the temperature from 300 °C to 500 °C led to an elevation in the CGE from 15.2% to 74.1% for the particle size A (0.13 mm) and from 8.3% to 68.4% for particle size B (0.8 mm). The trend of H2 yield and total gas yield with different parameter levels is inconsistent to determine their relative influence on the response. Therefore, multiple regression analysis coupled with ANOVA analysis was employed to study the influence of each process parameter and their interactions on the response. Furthermore, the S/N ratio analysis was employed to evaluate the optimum level of each process parameter."
10,Statistical analysis of experimental results,"3.3 Statistical analysis of experimental results The normality plot in Fig. 6 was used to ascertain the normality of H2 yield obtained from hydrothermal gasification experiments involving PBW at variable temperature, residence time, feed concentration and biomass particle size. The figure shows the residuals plotted against their expected values at normal distribution. It is obtained by plotting the ordered response values (H2 yields arranged in ascending order) against the normally ordered statistical means. As shown in Fig. 6, all the data on the plots are arranged in a straight line, thereby confirming that the data for H2 yield is normally distributed (Kang et al., 2016). ANOVA was carried out to determine the relative contribution of each factor and the most significant parameters that influence H2 and total gas yields. P-values were used to evaluate the statistical significance of each factor using a 95% confidence interval. Table 4 shows the ANOVA results for the means of the response. Other parameters such as the F-test value, the sequential sum of squares (Seq SS) and the adjusted sum of squares (Adj SS) are also included in the ANOVA study. The source in the ANOVA shows where the variation comes from i.e., each parameter (e.g., biomass particle size, temperature, residence time and feed concentration). This is usually from the experimental factors, their interactions or from the error. For each source, the degree of freedom (DF) is defined as the number of observations that could be varied freely during the statistical estimation. It is usually calculated from Eq. (9), where ‘n’ is defined as the number of factors in the study (Venkatesan et al., 2015). (9) DF = n − 1 As shown in Table 4, the DF for temperature, residence time and feed concentration is 2 since three-levels were considered for these parameters, whereas for biomass particle size it was 1 because of two-levels of study. Besides, 17 DFs are required for the full set of parameters. The sum of squares in statistics shows the sum of the square between and within groups. On the other hand, dividing the sum of squares by the DF yields the mean squares. In Table 4, the parameter with a p-value less than 0.05 (95% confidence interval) is considered non-significant. The temperature showed the lowest p-value and the highest F-test value. Therefore, it is the most significant factor that exhibits the greatest impact on H2 yield. Moreover, the sum of squares for temperature was also the highest. On the other hand, the p-values of particle size (0.51) and residence time (0.7) were found to be above 0.05. Therefore, they are not considered significant parameters. It is important to note that the higher the F-test value of any parameter the more significant it influences the H2 yields (Dhawane et al., 2016). Hence, high F-test values and low p-values (<0.05) are associated with a significant parameter. The response table for the means of each factor at a different level is presented in Table 5 . This table helps to identify the order of impact that each experimental factor has on H2 yields. The ranking of each parameter based on the Delta statistical method is provided in this table. The ranking parameter, which is estimated by taking the difference between the highest and the lowest average for each factor compares the relative importance of each factor (Kang et al., 2016). As illustrated in Table 5, the rank shows that temperature is the most important parameter that influences H2 yields. The relative significance of each process factor was in the order of temperature > feed concentration > residence time > biomass particle size. Several studies on the supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of waste biomasses also reported temperature as the most significant factor (Reddy et al., 2016; Gong et al., 2017; Okolie et al., 2020b, 2020c). To describe the statistical relationship between the response (H2 yield) and the experimental factors (also known as the predictors) an equation is proposed. The equation also helps in the prediction of new observations. The coefficient of each predictor in the equation and the constant term was determined by using the least-squares method. Eq. (10) and Eq. (11) show the regression equation for H2 yield as a function of temperature, residence time and feed concentration for particle sizes A and B, respectively. Particle size A: (10) H 2 yield ( mmol / g ) = − 3.3 + 0.0163 T ( ° C ) + 0.0107 RT ( min ) − 0.1283 FC ( wt% ) Particle size B: (11) H 2 yield ( mmol / g ) = − 3.54 + 0.0163 T ( ° C ) + 0.0107 RT ( min ) − 0.1283 FC ( wt% ) The regression equations show a negative correlation for feed concentration with H2 yield and a positive correlation for temperature and residence time. Besides, the model summary statistics in Table 6 indicate that the validity of the regression model with an R2 value of 85% and a low standard deviation of 0.64."
11,Parametric studies,"3.4 Parametric studies As indicated from the ANOVA results, the temperature was identified as one of the most significant factors influencing H2 yield and total gas yield during hydrothermal gasification of PBW. Fig. 7 shows the effects of hydrothermal gasification process parameters (i.e., biomass particle size, temperature, residence time and feed concentration) on H2 yields from PBW. The effect of biomass particle size (size A, 0.13 mm and size B, 0.8 mm) in H2 yield is shown in Fig. 7a. As can be seen, PBW with a small particle size (0.13 mm) led to a superior H2 yield compared to PBW with a larger particle size (0.8 mm). Small biomass particle size enhances H2 yield by providing a large surface area per unit mass required for degradation and solubility in hydrothermal conditions (Okolie et al., 2019). Additionally, the increased surface area provided by smaller particle size feedstocks also improves the heat and mass transfer between the particles during gasification. Okolie et al. (2020b) reported similar results on the effects of biomass particle size on H2 yield during the subcritical and supercritical water gasification of soybean straw. An elevation in H2 yield was observed from 3.86 mmol/g (at 0.13 mm biomass particle size) to 6.61 mmol/g (at 0.8 mm biomass particle size). The trend for H2 yields as a function of gasification temperature is shown in Fig. 7b. A temperature increases from 300 °C (subcritical conditions) to 500 °C (supercritical conditions) produces a subsequent elevation in H2 yield by 68%. At low-temperature subcritical conditions, the ionic products (i.e., H+ and OH−) formation are dominant, thus leading to relatively low H2 yield and improved CO and CH4 yields. On the other hand, as the temperature rose from subcritical to supercritical conditions, free radical mechanisms are enhanced, which improves H2 and total gas yields (Reddy et al., 2014). Water-gas shift (WGS) reaction and steam reforming reaction are dominant at supercritical conditions, thereby contributing towards H2 yields at high temperatures. Moreover, steam reforming of biomass is regarded as an endothermic reaction that uses a vast quantity of energy to degrade complex molecules into useful products (Correa and Kruse, 2018). Compared to thermal cracking reactions that produce mostly hydrocarbons, reforming reaction produces gaseous products such as H2 and CO (Eq. (12)) (Singh et al., 2018). Water-gas shift reaction is an exothermic reaction that occurs when water reacts with CO to produce CO2 and H2 as illustrated in Eq. (13). Therefore, at high-temperature supercritical conditions, the production of CO is limited due to its consumption in the WGS reaction while H2 yield increases. Besides, the WGS reaction becomes active at high water density and excess water concentration as in the case of lower feed concentration. Steam reforming reaction: (12) CH x O y + ( 1 − y ) H 2 O → CO + ( 1 − y + 0.5 x ) H 2 Water-gas shift reaction: (13) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 The effect of residence time on H2 yield is indicated in Fig. 7c. H2 yield rose from 1.51 mmol/g to 2.01 mmol/g with an increase in residence time from 15 min to 45 min, respectively. Residence time plays a significant role in the formation of gaseous products during hydrothermal gasification. Prolonged residence time is important for the decomposition and thermal cracking of biomass into gaseous products (Gong et al., 2017). Primary reactions such as dehydration, bond cleavage, decarboxylation and depolymerization are also favored at prolonged residence time, thereby enhancing H2 yield (Reddy et al., 2016). Additionally, longer residence times are necessary for the hydrothermal gasification process to reach equilibrium. Three feed concentrations were considered in this study (i.e., 10, 15 and 20 wt%), with their influence on H2 yield presented in Fig. 7d. An increase in feed concentration respectively from 10 wt% to 20 wt% led to a decline in H2 yield by 55% (from 2.25 mmol/g to 1.01 mmol/g). The influence of feed concentration can be explained by considering the ratio of biomass-to-water in the aqueous reaction medium. A rise in the concentration of feedstock is equivalent to a decline in water in the reaction mixture. Since water acts as a solvent, a reactant and a catalyst during hydrothermal gasification, a decline for water concerning the quantity of biomass would lead to a decrease in the gas yield and H2 yield. Likewise, a decline in feed concentration corresponds to an increased concentration of water molecules in the feed. It is important to note that an increased concentration of water molecules in the feed is desirable for H2 production since it enhances the solvation properties of biomass under hydrothermal conditions. Furthermore, the excess water molecules contribute towards H2 production from hydrothermal gasification. Hydrogen selectivity and LHV of gaseous products obtained from the hydrothermal gasification of PBW at varying process conditions are also shown in Table 2. For biomass particle size A (0.13 mm), the lowest hydrogen selectivity and LHV values of 18.3% and 144 kJ/Nm3, respectively were observed at experimental run #3 (i.e., 300 °C, 45 min and 20 wt% feed concentration). On the other hand, the gaseous products obtained from experimental run #9 (i.e., 500 °C, 45 min and 10 wt% feed concentration) showed the highest LHV value of 1541 kJ/Nm3. Surprisingly, the maximum H2 selectivity (85.8%) was obtained from experimental run #7 (i.e., 500 °C, 15 min and 15 wt% feed concentration). Superior H2 selectivity of experimental run #7 compared to run #9 could be attributed to the disparity in residence time. Prolonged residence time could help improve reactions such as hydrogenation and methanation. These reactions utilize CO and H2 to produce CH4, thereby decreasing H2 selectivity and the yields of H2 and CO (Okolie et al., 2020b). The gasification results of PBW with larger particle size B (0.8 mm) also revealed minimum values for LHV (19 kJ/Nm3) and H2 selectivity (8.04%) from experimental run #10 (i.e., 300 °C, 15 min and 20 wt% feed concentration). Maximum LHV value of 1486 kJ/Nm3 was obtained from experimental run #17 (i.e., 500 °C, 30 min and 10 wt% feed concentration) while the run #14 (i.e., 400 °C, 30 min and 20 wt% feed concentration) resulted in the highest H2 selectivity of 66.7%. The interactive effects of the process parameters are illustrated in Fig. 8 . The interactions could play significant roles in the hydrothermal gasification process. Moreover, the actual interactive effects of process parameters on gas yields could even exceed their individual effects. As shown in Fig. 8d, there is no interaction between temperature and biomass particle size. As the biomass particle size was changed from Size A (0.13 mm) to Size B (0.8 mm), the temperature remained almost the same, which is indicated by the straight-line plots for each temperature. Similarly, at high feed concentration, the interactions between particle size and feed concentration are negligible while little interaction occurred at a low feed concentration of 10 wt% (Fig. 8h). As stated earlier, low feed concentration signifies that the amount of water is relatively higher compared to that of biomass. Higher water concentration and smaller biomass particle size facilitate the reaction between biomass and water molecules, thereby increasing H2 yields. Furthermore, from Fig. 8f, the interactions between biomass particle size and feed concentration are inherent. Temperature seems to be the most significant factor influencing H2 yields by exhibiting notable interactions with residence time. At a constant temperature of 300 °C, H2 yield increased with an elevation in residence time up to 30 min followed by a decline. On the other hand, at 500 °C, H2 yield increased continuously with longer residence time due to water-gas shift and reforming reactions (Fig. 8e)."
12,Determination of optimum process conditions and validation of experimental results,"3.5 Determination of optimum process conditions and validation of experimental results Based on the results of process parameters on hydrothermal gasification presented in Fig. 7, the optimum conditions maximizing H2 yield are found to be temperature (500 °C), residence time (45 min), feed concentration (10 wt%) and biomass particle size A (0.13 mm). The Taguchi experimental design was used in the prediction of H2 yield at the optimum process factors. The predicted H2 yield at the optimum condition is shown in Table 2 as 4.05 mmol/g. Three verification experiments were carried out at optimum experimental conditions to enable the validation of the Taguchi experimental design. The triplicate experiments and their corresponding H2 yield were compared with the predicted H2 yield from the Taguchi design. The average gas phase composition obtained from the triplicate experiments is shown in Fig. 9 with the mean H2 yield reported as 5.3 ± 1.2 mmol/g. The deviation between the predicted H2 yield and its experimental value was found to be less than 20%. Moreover, the slight deviation between the experimental and predicted H2 yields could be explained by the low value of adjusted R2 (80.4%) and predicted R2 (67.4%). As shown in Fig. 9, the main products obtained from the supercritical water gasification of PBW at optimum conditions include H2 (5.3 mmol/g), CO2 (3.4 mmol/g), CH4 (3.1 mmol/g) and C2–C4 hydrocarbons (0.1 mmol/g). It is important to note that CO was found below the detection limit in the gaseous products during the hydrothermal gasification of PBW at optimum conditions (i.e., 500 °C, 45 min, 10 wt% feed concentration and particle size A, 0.13 mm). The reasons for the absence of CO in the gaseous products could be a result of its consumption in WGS, hydrogenation and methanation reactions at high temperatures during SCW gasification (at 500 °C). Gaseous products derived from the hydrothermal gasification of some complex organic compounds such as humic acid, lauric acid and glycine have also been reported to contain little (<1 mmol/g) or no CO (Azadi et al., 2013; Gong et al., 2017). Gaseous products obtained from the hydrothermal gasification of PBW at optimal conditions in this study were compared with that of other lignocellulosic feedstocks, coal, hydrochar and model compounds reported in the literature as shown in Table 7 . Lignocellulosic biomass is regarded as a heterogeneous mixture comprising of three fundamental biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in varying composition along with extractives and ash (mineral matter) (Tursi, 2019). Moreover, the variable physicochemistry of lignocellulosic biomass influences their behavior of hydrothermal cracking in SCWG. The H2 yields from coal and PBW are remarkably lower than those obtained from other feedstocks. Furthermore, the CO yields from these feedstocks are either not detected or less than 2% regardless of the feedstock type and process conditions. This could be due to the occurrence of WGS reaction under supercritical conditions. The naturally occurring ions in plant-based biomass (as essential nutrients) also help catalyze the WGS reaction (Castello et al., 2014). Compared with unburnt pinewood (3.1 mmol/g), the H2 yield obtained from PBW was slightly higher (5.3 mmol/g). Similarly, the CH4 yield from PBW was also higher. PBW represents woody biomass that has been thermally decomposed to a partial extent with the removal of moisture and volatile matter. The removal of moisture and volatile matter occurs via dehydration and devolatilization to increase the heating value and carbon content of the carbonized material (Table 3). Therefore, the improved solid fuel properties of PBW could be responsible for the superior gaseous yield. On the contrary, Castello et al. (2014) reported a decrease in gaseous yield when biomass was subjected to hydrothermal carbonization to produce hydrochar. They attributed a decline in gas yields to the decrease in the amount of carbon available for conversation in the hydrochar. A fraction of the original carbon present in the biomass was transformed into the liquid phase and further converted into CO2 during hydrothermal carbonization. The resulting hydrochar was characterized by high carbon content and aromatic compounds (Castello et al., 2014). The carbon balance for the hydrothermal gasification products at a temperature range of 300–500 °C, a residence time of 45 min, the feedstock particle size of 0.13 mm (Size A) and feed concentration of 10 wt% is presented in Fig. 10 . The carbon content measured in all three phases ranged from 91 to 95 wt%. About 85% of carbon in the feedstock was retained or fixed in the hydrochar. This indicates that the produced hydrochar is largely carbonized. A rise in the reaction temperature from 300 °C to 500 °C led to a slight increase in the carbon content of the hydrochar. The liquid products had the lowest carbon content at all temperatures (1–1.1 wt%). On the other hand, the carbon content of the gaseous phases was in the range of 1.1–3.3 wt%. It is worthy to note that the overall carbon balance of the products obtained from the hydrothermal gasification of PBW was less than 100% due to challenges occurring during product separation and collection leading to an unavoidable mass loss. Some solid residues (hydrochar) were entrapped in the gas-liquid separator being collected as part of the liquid effluents, thereby causing slight inaccuracies in their measurements."
13,Characterization of liquid effluents obtained from hydrothermal gasification of PBW,"3.6 Characterization of liquid effluents obtained from hydrothermal gasification of PBW Since the temperature was found to be the most important process parameter influencing the gas yields as indicated by the Taguchi design, its effects on liquid effluents and hydrochar samples are investigated in this section. The liquid effluents derived from the hydrothermal gasification of PBW at a varying temperature in the range of 300–500 °C, the residence time of 45 min, PBW particle size A (0.13 mm) and feed concentration of 10 wt% were analyzed through the GC-MS analysis. The analysis helps to assess the quality of the liquid effluents and identify the presence of important compounds. As seen in Table 8 , it is evident that the liquid effluents contain compounds such as aromatics, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, hydrocarbons and trace nitrogen-containing compounds. The production of these compounds could be because of the pyrolytic behavior of residual cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin present in PBW. Pyrolysis or hydrothermal cracking of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin produces compounds such as acids, ketones, hydrocarbons, aromatics, phenols, etc. (Okolie et al., 2020a). Nanda et al. (2015b) reported that the liquid effluents obtained during the hydrothermal gasification of fructose at 550 °C and 25 MPa pressure for 60 s of residence time contained compounds such as methanol, acetone, hydroxyquinone, acetic acid, propionic acid, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and 2-furaldehyde (furfural). An increase in the temperature from subcritical conditions (300 °C) to supercritical conditions (400 °C) led to an elevation in the production of hydrocarbons followed by a subsequent decline at the supercritical condition (500 °C). This could be attributed to the enhanced decarboxylation reaction, thereby facilitating the formation of hydrocarbons. Besides, the production of acids rose slightly with the temperature increase from 300 °C to 500 °C. Alcohol formation at lower supercritical conditions (400 °C) was also the highest followed by a decline at 500 °C owing to their thermal decomposition and cracking to yield gases and lighter hydrocarbons. The concentration of phenols was lowest at 300 °C, highest at 400 °C and mediocre at 500 °C due to their conversion into aromatic compounds via deoxygenation. Similarly, the concentration of aromatics also increased with temperature. The GC-MS analysis also revealed the formation of nitrogenous compounds such as ergoline-8-carboxamide at low subcritical temperatures (300 °C). With an additional increase in temperature to 500 °C, the concentration of nitrogenous compounds declined. As the reaction temperature elevated from subcritical region (300 °C) to supercritical region (400–500 °C), the lower molecular weight compounds and liquid intermediates were decomposed into smaller fractionated compounds due to the improved cracking of volatile fraction to non-condensable gases (Yang et al., 2007). This could also lead to a reduction in the quantities of hydrocarbons and nitrogenous compounds."
14,Conclusions,"Wild forest fires release a significant level of pollutants and fine particles into the atmosphere with the potential to cause adverse health effects. In addition, they also generate large quantities of partially burnt wood and charred materials. In this study, hydrothermal gasification of PBW was investigated using the Taguchi experimental design. The influence of four parameters (temperature: 300–500 °C, residence time: 15–45 min, feed concentration: 10–30 wt% and biomass particle size A: 0.13 mm and particle size B: 0.8 mm) on H2 yield was comprehensively evaluated. Higher temperature, prolonged residence time, low feed concentration and smaller particle size favored H2 yield. In terms of the relative importance and contribution of each process parameter towards H2 yield, the rank was in the order of temperature > feed concentration > residence time > biomass particle size. Therefore, the temperature was observed to be the most important parameter that influences H2 yield during hydrothermal gasification of PBW. The optimum process conditions determined from the Taguchi experimental design were temperature (500 °C), residence time (45 min), feed concentration (10 wt%) and biomass particle size Size A (0.13 mm). Moreover, experimental H2 yield and total gas yield obtained at optimum conditions were 5.26 mmol/g and 11.9 mmol/g, respectively. Other gaseous products obtained at optimum conditions include CO2 (3.43 mmol/g), CH4 (3.13 mmol/g) and C2–C4 hydrocarbons (0.06 mmol/g). The GC-MS analysis of liquid effluents from subcritical and supercritical water gasification of PBW showed the presence of compounds such as aromatics, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, hydrocarbons and trace nitrogen-containing compounds. The experimental results show that PBW is a promising feedstock for H2 and hydrochar production through hydrothermal gasification. Further research should focus on the characterization of PBW obtained from different geographical locations and varying magnitudes of forest fires. A comparison of the physicochemical, structural and compositional properties of PBW with that of raw biomass, torrefied biomass, biochar and hydrochar could help in better understanding their utilization. In addition, the SCWG decomposition behavior of PBW should also be compared to hydrochar and torrefied biomass obtained under different experimental conditions."
