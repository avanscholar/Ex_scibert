0,Introduction,"Development of new catalysts for hydrogenation of multifunctional compounds is an area of great interest to a variety of industries. Selective hydrogenation of carbonyl group is of considerable importance in fragrance and pharmaceutical industries [1–4]. Both 1- and 2-phenythyl alcohols are important chemicals having wide spread applications, which could be produced by different routes. Styrene oxide hydrogenation can produce both of these alcohols under a set of certain conditions and thus selective production of each will be commercially attractive [5,6]. 1-Phenythyl alcohol (1-PEA) is a precursor for the preparation of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs, while its esters are largely used in perfumery and fragrance industries [7,8]. 1-PEA is prepared by hydrogenation of acetophenone. Selectivity to 1-phenethyl alcohol is a major problem since it is accompanied by hydrogenation of the aromatic ring including methyl cyclohexyl ketone (MCHK), 1-cyclohexyl ethanol (1-CHE) and ethyl benzene [9]. Acetophenone hydrogenation has been studied with various catalysts based on Pt [10–12], Pd [13], Ru [14] and Ni [14–21]. Cu/SiO2 showed very good activity with 100% selectivity toward 1-phenethyl alcohol [7]. Use of different redox materials could be attractive for this reaction. Manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves (OMS) possess an ordered array of edge and vertex shared MnO6 moieties. Cryptomelane (OMS-2, also known as K-OMS-2) type manganese oxide has shown good activity for various oxidation processes [22–31]. Due to the presence of Mn ions, cryptomelane (OMS-2) structure possesses excellent redox properties [32,33]. During oxidation reaction, the catalyst undergoes reduction in its oxidation state from Mn4+ to Mn2+ which can be easily reoxidized to Mn4+, in presence of oxygen. It was conceived that the incorporation of Ag into K-OMS-2 would render it interesting redox properties much different from the parent K-OMS-2 and thus the current work was undertaken. There is no published report on use of Ag-OMS-2 in hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds. We report here the synthesis and characterization of Ag-OMS-2 and its application in hydrogenation of acetophenone to 1-phenylethyl alcohol. Effect of various parameters was studied to derive mechanism and kinetics."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All chemicals were procured from firms of repute and used without further purification as follows: acetophenone, n-dodecane, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol (AR grade; M/s. s. d. Fine Chem. Ltd., Mumbai, India). Hydrogen gas (GC grade purity) was procured from Inox Air Ltd., Mumbai."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Silver substituted manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (Ag-OMS-2) was synthesized by precipitation method under acidic conditions. Silver loading was varied from 5 to 15wt.%. Details of synthesis and characterization are given in our recent work [32,33]. A brief discussion is provided here. Silver nitrate solution was added to the acidic solution of manganese acetate. Concentrated nitric acid was added to manganese acetate to maintain a pH of 1.0. Different mass of silver was selected as per the loading of silver required in the final catalyst. Dropwise addition of potassium permanganate solution to manganese acetate was carried out at 70°C. Rigorous stirring was maintained during the addition of KMnO4. The resulting mixture was stirred and refluxed at 100°C for 24h. The precipitate was washed several times with distilled water to make it neutral, and the final product was filtered, dried at 120°C for 10h and calcined at 400°C [32,33]. After each washing step, solid catalyst was recovered and filtrate was tested using ICP analysis. In total about 2–3wt.% loss of initial silver content. These results are matching with EDX analysis results. OMS-2 [34] and UDCaT-3 were synthesized by methods reported earlier [35]."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Characterization of all catalysts was done and included: thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature programmed reduction (TPR), surface area and pore volume using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Details of analysis conditions and equipment used are discussed in detail elsewhere [32]."
5,Reaction procedure,"2.4 Reaction procedure Reactions were carried out in 100ml autoclave reactor made of Hastloy C supplied by Amar Equipments, Mumbai, India. Temperature was controlled with ±1°C using PID controller. Mass flow controller (MFC) was provided to control the flow of hydrogen gas. Pressure inside the reactor was maintained with MFC. The reactor was also equipped with gas inlet and outlet ports, sampling port, rupture disc and a magnetic drive to vary the speed of agitation. A hydrogen gas cylinder was used along with a constant pressure regulator for supply of H2. Before starting reaction, the catalyst was dried for 2h at 120°C in a furnace. Acetophenone hydrogenation was carried out with following reaction conditions. In a typical control experiment, 1ml n-dodecane was added as an internal standard to 0.0428mol acetophenone and the total volume of reaction mixture was made up to 50cm3 with isopropyl alcohol as solvent. The amount of catalyst added was 0.25g which corresponded to 0.005g/cm3 catalyst loading. The reactor was flushed with nitrogen at room temperature. Then it was flushed with hydrogen and hydrogen was charged at room temperature. Then heating was started. After attaining the desired reaction temperature, the pressure was adjusted to the desired value and a zero time sample was collected. Agitation was then commenced at 1200rpm. Samples were withdrawn after fixed intervals of time and analyzed by GC. The hydrogen pressure was maintained throughout. After completion of the experiment, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and hydrogen gas was discharged. The catalyst was filtered. Fresh methanol was added to catalyst and refluxed for 2h. After cooling it to room temperature, the catalyst was filtered. Again the same procedure of washing and refluxing with methanol was repeated twice. It was dried at 120°C and re-calcined at 350°C for 4h."
6,Method of analysis,"2.5 Method of analysis Analysis of reaction mixture was performed by GC on a Chemito 1000 model. A 30m×1.54mm internal diameter capillary column (BP-50) was used for analysis in conjunction with a flame ionization detector. The quantification of collected data was done through a calibration procedure by using synthetic mixtures and it was used to get conversions, rates and selectivity. The products were confirmed with GC–MS and using authentic samples. The conversions were calculated from the data obtained from GC analysis and calibration. Selectivity was defined based on the number of moles of 1-phenethyl alcohol (B, desired product) produced to total number of moles of acetophenone converted during reaction."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synthesis and characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of catalysts Synthesis of Ag-OMS-2 resulted in a brownish black nano-fibrous powder material. The synthetic Ag-OMS-2 catalyst had a one-dimensional tunnel structure formed by 2×2 edge shared MnO6 octahedral chains. A brief discussion for catalyst characterization is given below. TGA analysis confirmed the catalyst stability till 500°C. SEM confirmed the presence of nano fibrous structure of the catalysts. Surface morphology of K-OMS-2 remained unaltered even after addition of silver. Presence of silver inside the pores of catalyst was confirmed by EDX analysis. The basic structure of the catalyst was confirmed by XRD analysis. XRD results also confirmed the existence of silver ions inside the framework. TPD analysis, with ammonia and carbon dioxide as probe molecule, demonstrated the presence of acidic and basic sites on the surface of catalyst, respectively (Table 1 ). Fig. 1 shows decrease in reduction temperature of OMS-2 decreases from 280 to 170°C on addition of 5% (w/w) of silver in OMS-2 catalyst. Similar results were observed for 10% Ag-OMS-2 and 15% Ag-OMS-2. Such effects have been also observed by others [36,37]. TPR studies also confirmed the silver existence in the catalyst. Surface area and pore volume increased with increasing Ag loading from 5 to 15% (Table 2 ). This is because Ag+ ions are smaller than K+. Varadarajan et al. have also observed increase in surface area of Ce-doped K-OMS-2 compared to conventionally synthesized K-OMS-2 [38]. To understand the effect of addition of silver in K-OMS-2 on acidity, basicity and hydrogenation activity, TPR-TPO studies were carried out systematically. Introduction of silver ions modifies the surface properties of the OMS-2 particles, resulting from the reduction of the number of free hydroxyl groups and deposition of strongly dispersed silver particles on the outer surface of the oxides. Incorporation of small amounts of silver by direct addition during synthesis results in partial replacement of potassium ions from the channels which change the catalytic properties. Since Ag+ are smaller than K+, there is a likelihood of structural alteration in manganese oxide during synthesis and thermal treatment, leading to the formation of different sized channels, dislocations or oxygen vacancies. Thus, increase in surface area and formation of mesoporous structure was observed. The presence of silver ions or small silver crystallites can increase the number of active sites on the surface of manganese oxides and improve catalytic properties due to silver–manganese interactions [32]. This has been also observed by Gac and coworkers [39,40]."
9,Reaction,"3.2 Reaction Hydrogenation of acetophenone is a complex reaction (Scheme 1 ). During hydrogenation, path 1 will give 1-phenyl ethanol as the desired product whereas parallel path 2 will give methyl cyclohexyl ketone by ring hydrogenation. The consecutive reactions of 1-phenyl ethanol lead to ethylbenzene by path 11 and to 1-cyclohexyl ethanol by ring hydrogenation by path 12. Thus, there is a possibility of 4 products being formed. The separation of these products is also difficult. Therefore, design and synthesis of a suitable catalyst is very important. 3.2.1 Catalyst screening Fig. 2 compares the performance of various catalysts used in hydrogenation of acetophenone after 1h. The activity and selectivity of 10 and 15% Ag-OMS-2 catalysts at 25atm and 160°C were substantially higher vis-a-vis UDCaT-3 which was developed in our laboratory [32]. The selectivity was 100% in all Ag-OMS-2 catalysts. The TPR studies showed that addition of silver reduces the reduction temperature of K-OMS-2 catalyst from 280 to 170°C. Higher activity of Ag-OMS-2 catalysts can be contributed to its ability to uptake hydrogen due to the presence of Ag even at lower temperature as compared to OMS-2. At a hydrogen pressure of 25 atm, the conversions with 5%, 10% and 15% Ag-OMS-2 were 27.9, 58.2 and 63.6%, respectively, after 1h. At a lower pressure of 10atm, the conversion of acetophenone after 2h increased from 45% to 66% when the silver loading was increased from 10% to 15% Ag in OMS-2. Silver loading certainly enhanced the catalytic activity. Thus, 15% Ag-OMS-2 was selected for further study. The selectivity to 1-PEA was 100% in all cases. Increasing partial pressure of hydrogen reduces the difference in level of conversion. The calculation of TON/TOF at 10atm pressure showed that 15% Ag-OMS-2 was better than 10% Ag-OMS-2. For sake of brevity, the data for 10atm pressure for all catalysts are not presented here. Further reactions were carried out at 10atm hydrogen pressure with 15% Ag-OMS-2. The selectivity still remained 100% in all cases. 3.2.2 Effects of speed of agitation Fig. 3 shows the effect of speed of agitation on conversion of acetophenone. There is no gas-side mass transfer resistance for pure hydrogen. To find the effect of mass transfer resistance in the liquid film, reactions were carried out with four different speeds of agitation. As speed of agitation was increased from 600 to 1000rpm, there was a significant increase in acetophenone conversion. This shows substantial mass transfer resistance at lower speed of agitation. Further increase in speed of agitation from 1000rpm to 1200rpm did not increase the conversion which confirmed that there was no mass transfer resistance to the transfer of acetophenone from bulk liquid phase to the external surface of the catalyst particle at speeds beyond 1000rpm. To be on the safer side, further experiments were conducted at 1200rpm. 3.2.3 Proof of absence of intra-particle diffusion resistance A theoretical calculation was done by using the Wiesz–Prater criterion to assess the influence of intra-particle diffusion resistance; according to which the dimensionless parameter C wp representing the ratio of the intrinsic reaction rate to intra-particle diffusion rate can be evaluated from the observed rate of reaction, the particle radius (R p), effective diffusivity of the limiting reactant (D e) and concentration of the reactant at the external surface of the particle. (i) If C w p = − r obs ρ p R p 2 / D e [ C AS ] ≫ 1 , then the reaction is limited by severe internal diffusion resistance. (ii) If C wp ≪1, then the reaction is intrinsically kinetically controlled. The effective diffusivity of ferrocene (D e–A) inside the pores of the catalyst was obtained from the bulk diffusivity (D AB), porosity (ɛ) and tortuosity (τ), where D e–A = D AB (ɛ/τ). In the present case, the value of C wp was calculated as 1.6×10−3 for the initial observed rate, which is much less than 1, and this signifies the absence of resistance due to intra-particle diffusion; therefore, the reaction could be considered as an intrinsically kinetically controlled reaction. A further proof of the absence of the intra-particle diffusion resistance was obtained by the study of the effect of temperature and it will be discussed later. 3.2.4 Effect of solvent Fig. 4 shows the effect of various solvents on conversion and selectivity. Bertero et al. [39] have studied solvent effect and reported that protic polar solvents are the best solvents. Thus, four most commonly used solvents such as methanol, ethanol, iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) and toluene were used. Toluene, a non-polar solvent, showed poor conversion as compared to the polar solvents like methanol and IPA. In this work IPA provided the highest conversion of acetophenone and selectivity to 1-PEA. Unlike in methanol and ethanol, the reaction in isopropanol yielded 1-PEA in high yield and selectivity, producing only a minor amounts byproducts thereby demonstrating that a steric factor is governing the reactivity. These results are consistent with observations made by others on solvent effects [7,40]. 3.2.5 Effect of hydrogen pressure Effect of hydrogen pressure was studied in the range of 5–25atm (Fig. 5 ). Conversion of acetophenone increased with an increase in hydrogen pressure. At a pressure of 20atm there was no considerable change in the conversion level. This can be explained on the basis of the concentration of concentration of hydrogen at the active sites, which remains constant after certain high pressure. Selectivity in all the cases remained at 100%. Thus, hydrogen pressure of 10atm was selected for further studies. 3.2.6 Effect of catalyst loading Conversion of acetophenone increased with increasing catalyst loading (Fig. 6 ). Initial rate of hydrogenation was directly proportional to catalyst loading (figure not shown). At 0.01g/cm3 catalyst loading reaction was very fast. Therefore, a loading of 0.005g/cm3 was selected as the best catalyst loading for further study. 3.2.7 Effect of acetophenone concentration Acetophenone concentration was varied from 0.4283×10−3 to 1.7133×10−3 mol/cm3. The conversion of acetophenone decreased with an increase in acetophenone concentration (Fig. 7 ). However, it should be recognized that the initial rate of reaction is linear in initial concentration of acetophenone due to corresponding increase in number of active sites. Selectivity for 1-phenethyl alcohol remained at 100%. 3.2.8 Effect of temperature Effect of temperature was studied under otherwise similar conditions from 140 to 170°C (Fig. 8 ). Conversion of acetophenone increased substantially with an increase in temperature. It suggested an intrinsically kinetically controlled mechanism as will be discussed later. 3.2.9 Catalyst stability and reuse To test if any leaching of active metal would occur, hydrogenation of aceptophenone was carried out for 1h only. Then reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. Excess hydrogen was vented off and the catalyst was filtered from the reaction mixture. The reaction was carried out further without any catalyst. The conversions after 3h reaction time showed that there was no change in concentration of acetophenone without the catalyst. It confirmed that there was no leaching of active metal during the reaction. The ICP analysis was also done and the liquid phase samples of reaction mixture were tested for presence of metal ions in reaction mixture after 1, 2 and 3h. There was no presence of the metal ions. After completion of the experiment, the catalyst was regenerated as per the procedure discussed earlier. There was no make-up quantity of the catalyst, some of which was lost during filtration. The conversion of acetophenone had decreased significantly due to loss of catalyst activity. Even after second reuse catalyst activity reduces to 50% of the fresh catalysts. However, selectivity of 1-phenethyl alcohol remained the same (Fig. 9 ). It has been already proved that OMS-2 is a redox catalyst and shows very fast oxidation and reduction cycle of the changing Mn4+ to Mn2+ and vice versa under given reaction conditions. The catalyst was reused without any make up quantity and the experiments were done under otherwise similar conditions. There was no reduction in selectivity of the catalyst which would mean that no active sites were changed. However, there was a drop of 23% conversion from 88% to 65%. Since the catalyst was nano-fibrous, there were attrition losses during filtration, which could be 5–8%. In the absence of leaching and catalyst deactivation due to the formation of heavier products, it was expected to have good reuseability. However, the results showed a decrease in activity of catalysts with successive reuse. Catalyst itself undergoes reduction during the reaction. So this can lead to some structural changes in the catalysts. Suib [42] proposed that hydrogen can readily reduce primarily abundant Mn4+ ions to Mn3+ or Mn2+. Too much Mn3+ or Mn2+ can lead to entirely different structural types (non-tunnel systems) that are less porous materials. The substitution of K+ with Ag+ as well as some framework metal ions should render robustness to OMS-2. The structural changes in the catalyst can more readily happen if high pressure of hydrogen is used or further hydrogenation leads to different byproducts which are adsorbed within the pore network. In the current case, 100% selectivity is obtained and therefore, there is no deactivation by byproduct formation. The pore size distribution data suggest that there is a marginal hystereris in adsorption-desorption which is indicative of a pore structure with smaller coordination number (or pore connectivity). If any junction is blocked due to structural changes, it will render the pore accessibility difficult and hence loss of activity. The decrease in catalyst activity can be explained further through XRD analysis. The XRD patterns after second reuse and regenerated catalyst, under reflux with organic solvent, showed change in catalyst structure. These XRD patterns and TPR analysis suggest that Mn+4 is reduced to some extent during reaction. When the hydrogenation was done in liquid phase under constant but higher pressure, the extent of reduction was more. Thus activity of catalyst was reduced during successive reuse of catalyst. This was further probed. In the absence of silver, K-OMS-2 does not show any activity of catalyst. Addition of silver increases conversion of acetophenone gradually from 5% to 15% (w/w) Ag. The activity showed synergistic effect of combination of silver and manganese active sites, which could be explained by TPR analysis. Almost 185ml of hydrogen/g of catalyst was consumed during TPR study during the control experiment. The stoichiometry suggests that for complete reduction of silver present in catalyst (max being 15wt%), hydrogen requirements will be very small. Silver is in Ag+ form. The presence of Ag reduces reduction temperature of Mn4+ substantially. Hydrogen consumed during TPR study is contributed to reduction of both Mn4+ and Ag+ sites (the curves b–d in Fig. 1). However, major fraction of hydrogen is consumed for Mn site reduction. TPD analysis (Table 1), with ammonia and carbon dioxide as probe molecules, confirmed the existence of mild acidic and basic sites of Ag-OMS-2 [32]. In OMS-2 based catalysts, the existence of manganese in a mixture of oxidation states (+2, +3, and +4) is known. Addition of Ag inside the catalyst structure replaces K and decreases the strong acidic sites and makes it mildly acidic. It is observed that increasing the loading of silver ion from 5 to 15% w/w increases number of weak active sites. Two different peaks at lower temperature confirm the existence of two different types of acidic sites, one each for Mn4+ and Ag+ which was reported by us recently [32]. However, only one peak appeared in CO2 TPD profile. The basic sites are provided by Mn4+. In Ag-OMS-2 catalyst, manganese exists in mixed valency, Mn3+ (Mn2O3) and Mn4+ (MnO2). In our case, Ag+ ions have been incorporated in the tunnel structure of OMS-2. All TPD curves show low temperature peak at 110–120°C. That is due to weak acid sites present on the catalyst surface. On addition of silver from 0% to 10% on K-OMS-2, the amount of NH3 or CO2 adsorbed increased. Change in redox nature of K-OMS-2 after addition of silver was observed. Addition of 5% silver in K-OMS-2 catalyst results in decrease in reduction temperature of K-OMS-2 significantly from 280 to 150°C. The same trend was also observed for 10% Ag-OMS-2 and 15% Ag-OMS-2 also [32]. This is in consonance with those observed by others [36,37]. TPR studies also confirm the silver existence in the catalyst. Thus, from the foregoing, it appears that there is reduction of Ag+ (lesser extent) and Mn4+, particularly more pronounced at high pressures. To avoid structural changes in the catalysts, extent of hydrogenation should be controlled. With limited reduction of the active sites, its regeneration to original form Mn4+ can be ensured during regeneration and recalcination of the catalysts. Therefore, using lower pressure and limiting the conversion to lesser value should be useful."
10,Reaction scheme and mechanism,"Reactions in the presence of 15% Ag-OMS-2 showed 100% 1-phenthyl alcohol as the product. It is assumed that reaction follows LHHW type mechanism with involvement of two sites. If adsorption and desorption of the species are very weak and fast enough than the resistances provided by the adsorption; and if desorption resistance is negligible. Thus, the rate of reaction of acetophenone is given by a power law model: (1) − r A = k S R w C A P B 0 Above equation suggests that rate of acetophenone hydrogenation under constant hydrogen pressure is a function of concentration of acetophenone only. The above equation can be written in terms of the fractional conversion of acetophenone (X A ): − r A = C A 0 d X A d t = k S R w P B 0 C A 0 ( 1 − X A ) (2) d X A d t = k S R w P B 0 ( 1 − X A ) Solving Eq. (2) gives, (3) − ln ( 1 − X A ) = k S R w P B 0 t A plot the graph of −ln(1− X A ) vs. t gives a straight line passing through origin at different temperatures (Fig. 10 ). The rate constants were calculated from Fig. 10 at different temperatures and from Arrhenius plot. The apparent activation energy calculated is 12.38kcal/mol with a pre-exponential factor of 2.79×105 cm3/atmgmin. This value of activation energy is slightly higher than the reported value, 8–11kcal/mol with Pd or Pt based catalysts [41,42]. The activation energy value also suggests that the reaction is intrinsically kinetically controlled."
11,Conclusions,The redox nature of Ag-OMS-2 was systematically studied in the hydrogenation of acetophenone. Addition of silver from 5 to 15wt.% improves the activity of K-OMS-2 significantly. 15% Ag-OMS-2 showed the highest conversion of acetophenone with 100% selectivity for 1-phenethyl alcohol. The TPR study confirmed strong interaction of silver with OMS-2. A detailed kinetic study was carried out. Reaction mechanism was proposed and LHHW type model with weak adsorption of all species leading to a power law model was fitted satisfactorily. The activation energy for acetophenone hydrogenation was calculated as 12.38kcal/mol.
