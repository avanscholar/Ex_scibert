0,Introduction,"Earth’s ecosystems have witnessed frequent wildfires (Australian bushfires, Amazon rainforest), severe droughts and flooding due to the warming of the planet (Lizundia-Loiola et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the total amount of CO2 emissions corresponds to 1.83 trillion tonnes (Allen et al., 2009) caused by excessive usage of fossil-fuels. This rapid discharge of CO2 overloaded the carbon-cycle and challenged the capacity of oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks (Matthews, 2007). However, the modern chemical and energy sectors heavily rely on fossil fuels, thus it is difficult to cease the consumption of fossil resources (Hoffert et al., 1998). Transition to renewables could be accelerated by blending biomass-derived oils with fossil-fuels using the existing refinery processes and consequently replace crude-oil with biomass and other carbonaceous waste. Several technologies are available for biomass transformation into liquid fuels, including pyrolysis (Atanda et al., 2020; Perkins et al., 2018), gasification, liquefaction (Perkins et al., 2019), and fermentation (McKendry, 2002a,b). A trade-off must be made between the economic feasibility, the required energy input, carbon yield and fuel quality. Among others, fast pyrolysis is a more robust and mature technology suitable for biomass to biofuel conversion (McKendry, 2002a,b). Thermal (non-catalytic) pyrolysis produces poor quality oil containing oxygenated compounds (ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, alcohols, sugars, furans, and phenols) (Zhang et al., 2007). The introduction of catalysts to the pyrolysis promotes dehydration, decarboxylation, decarbonylation reactions, which consequently improves the quality of bio-oil (Shen et al., 2010). Researchers proposed hydrotreatment of the bio-oil as an additional process aiming to maximise hydrodeoxygenation and increase H/C ratio. The cost and source of hydrogen are unknown, thus those need to be considered for any economic feasibility calculations (Vispute et al., 2010). To produce hydrocarbon-rich oil from biomass, utilization of other carbonaceous waste materials as a hydrogen donor had been considered. Co-pyrolysis of biomass with other waste offers an advantage by allowing the hydrogen transfer to take place in one reactor with no additional units. Mixed feedstock pyrolysis shown to have positive synergistic interaction that improved the oil quality coupled with providing safe and effective waste treatment (plastic, tires, and lubricant oil). The presence of catalysts during the co-pyrolysis facilitates certain desired reactions such as deoxygenation, dehydrogenation, cracking, and aromatization. The advanced synthesis methods enable to control and enhance the shape selectivity, which directs the reaction pathway and favours the production of the required compounds. The determination of feedstock and oil quality depends on elemental composition of feedstock (hydrogen/carbon/oxygen). The comparison between feedstock and final oil quality is typically based on the effective hydrogen index (EHI), which calculated by the following equation (Chen et al., 1988): H C eff = H - 2 O - 3 N - 2 S C The regular range of H/Ceff of any biomass feedstock is between 0 and 0.3, after catalytic fast pyrolysis H/Ceff increases to 0.8 which is lower than the diesel (H/Ceff = 2.0) (Huang et al., 2016). Nevertheless, some studies are considering pyrolysis oil with H/Ceff values beyond 1.0 as a satisfying composition for further upgrading and use in petro-engine (Zhang et al., 2011). The use of EHI as an indicator is a beneficial tool to determine the required ratio of co-feed as well as to assess the catalyst efficiency in oil upgrading. Synergy factor has been widely used by researchers to quantify the positive impact of co-pyrolysis. The synergistic interaction between biomass and plastic occurs producing high amount of pyrolysis oil and aromatics yields compared to individual pyrolysis (Wei et al., 2017). In this article, numerous research studies focused on catalytic pyrolysis of biomass with abundant and hydrogen-rich materials were discussed. Due to a large number of articles on this topic, only the studies on co-feed materials with H/Ceff ≥ 1 were selected. Fig. 1 was constructed based on all literature referenced in this review. Among them, ZSM-5 was the most favourable catalyst due to its shape selectivity toward aromatics explored in more than 55% of the studies. Besides ZSM-5, zeolite Y was the second favourable catalyst (10%) because of its large pore system. Mesoporous silica, namely MCM-41 and SBA-15, were within the scope of many studies as each of them attracted 7% of the total studies. In terms of co-feed additives, plastics were dominant taking up to 69% of the studies, which attributed to plastic abundance in the waste processing sector. Alcohols also gained attention due to their high H/Ceff and adequate reaction mechanism, which contributes to the hydrocarbon pool. This review outlined the catalyst modifications reported in the literature and their effects on reaction mechanism and synergistic interaction between the biomass and co-feed additives, along with reviewing the reactor setups used in each study."
1,Catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics,"The annual production of all types of plastics reached 360 million tonnes in 2018 and steadily increasing to meet the accelerated demand of different industries, according to Plastic Europe statistics (Czernik et al., 2002). Unfortunately, only 13% of plastic waste goes to recycling and the remaining were sent to various waste management systems, including landfilling and incineration (Degnan and Shinde, 2019). Unlike biomass, most plastic resins are rich in hydrogen; therefore, co-feeding plastics and biomass could effectively enrich the quality of the obtained oil by overcoming hydrogen deficiency. Multiple studies have focused on the catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics. Zeolites, in particular, ZSM-5, are the most common catalysts chosen due to their effective catalytic performance in the conversion of biomass and hydrocarbons. To improve the catalytic performance of the zeolitic catalysts, the introduction of hierarchical porosity or modification by the addition of metals and oxides was often reported. Below, the existing literature on the catalytic co-pyrolysis between biomass and plastic will be reviewed with a special focus on the catalyst and their impact of the conversion mechanisms."
2,Co-pyrolysis over commercial ZSM-5,"2.1 Co-pyrolysis over commercial ZSM-5 The effect of co-feeding of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polyproplyene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) with cellulose, lignin and pinewood materials over commercial ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 12.5) was investigated by Li et al. (2014, 2013). At a fixed ratio of biomass and plastic (1:1), the group was able to demonstrate significant synergism between the two feedstocks, which positively reflected on aromatics yield. The co-feeding of LDPE increased the aromatics yield to 47.4% compared with 37.6 and 34.3% when cellulose and LDPE pyrolyzed individually, respectively. Furthermore, 85% of these aromatics are monoaromatics, which have a high market value. Among many combinations of co-feeding feedstock, they had observed that the highest synergy incurred when cellulose co-pyrolyzed with LDPE, which attributed to the reactivity of depolymerisation products of LPDE compared to PP and PS. The branched olefins and styrene, which produced from the depolymerisation of PP and PS, respectively, were not highly reactive with the furans. The linear α-olefins resulted from LDPE pyrolysis tended to form aromatics via Diels-Alder reactions with the furans. They reported that the decomposition of lignin mainly produced phenolic compounds which were easily coked over ZSM-5 considerably lowering the synergy with the plastic volatiles. Although the results might seem to be promising, a high ratio (15:1-catalyst: feedstock) was deployed to achieve these results. An advanced study carried out by Dorado et al. (2015) to understand the reaction mechanism between cellulose and plastic over commercial ZSM-5 by isotope carbon tracing. The carbon isotopes originated from biomass is denoted 13C, where the other carbon isotope from the plastic source is denoted 12C. They had shown that the ethylene and propylene, which produced as intermediates during the co-pyrolysis of LDPE and PP with cellulose, had a mixture of 13C and 12C and they can be subjected to further reaction in the pores of ZSM-5 catalyst. These intermediates participated in oligomerization and aromatization forming alkyl benzenes, which further reacted to form BTX (Benzene, Toluene, Xylene) via hydrocarbon pool mechanism. Along with the hydrocarbon pool mechanism, they also demonstrated that the BTX can be formed by Diels-Alder mechanism due to the reaction between the small olefins and the furans derived from cellulose pyrolysis. Other plastics (PS and PET) produced longer chain intermediates that are unable to diffuse to zeolite active sites; thus less amount of mixed aromatics were produced. This work demonstrated various decomposition fragments of PP, PE PS and PET and their role in aromatics yield. The production of naphthalene was reported by Dual et al. when alkali lignin co-pyrolyzed with PP over commercial ZSM-5 using microwave irradiation (Duan et al., 2017). They observed the aromatics yield can be enhanced and the cycloalkanes yield can be reduced by increasing the catalyst to feedstock ratio. This conclusion indicates that the increase active sites or high ZSM-5 catalyst ratio allows the Diels-Alder reaction, promotes the production of alkenes and aromatics and suppresses the cyclization reaction. Deploying the same catalyst and reaction setup, Zhao et al. (2018) had investigated the co-pyrolysis of bamboo with PP. The addition of PP increased the aromatics yield to a certain level where more increase in PP ratio resulted in the decrease of aromatics due to the availability of more hydrogen radicals, which converted the aromatics to naphthenic products. The addition of plastic materials to biomass pyrolysis not only improved bio-oil quality but also reduced the deactivation rate of the catalyst and prolonged its lifetime. To understand the role of plastic in co-pyrolysis and its effect on reducing the coke formation, Mullen et al. studied the co-pyrolysis of switchgrass with HDPE over ZSM-5 (Mullen et al., 2018). During the cellulose co-pyrolysis, PE and PP decomposed into olefins, which either reacted directly with the furans and produced aromatics via Diels-Alder mechanism or subjected to dehydrogenation over the catalyst active sites and released hydrogen, which promoted the deoxygenation of the cellulose derivatives into olefins. These olefins further reacted through hydrocarbon pool mechanism and formed aromatics. In both scenarios, the co-pyrolysis inhibited the polymerization of oxygenated intermediates, which typically were the main cause of coke formation and catalyst deactivation. In the case of lignin co-pyrolysis, the lignin thermally decomposed into phenolic products that are less reactive with the plastic-derived hydrocarbons and consequently minimized the positive influence of plastic co-feeding in promoting aromatics compounds. In the absence of plastics co-feeding, the lignin-derived phenols inclined to polymerize on the external surface of the catalyst and subsequently formed coke, restricting the access to the zeolite pores. Dehydrogenation of plastic-derived olefins to aromatics released hydrogen radicals and stabilized phenolic compounds, therefore the polymerization was eliminated and subsequently, the coke formation was reduced (Xue et al., 2016). Furthermore, hydrogen promoted cracking of phenolic compounds into smaller oxygenates, which can diffuse into the catalyst pores, forming aromatics and olefins via hydrocarbon pool mechanism (Mullen and Boateng, 2010). Since the reaction mechanism and intermediates of cellulose and lignin are different during the plastic co-pyrolysis, Xue et al. independently co-pyrolyzed cellulose and lignin with PE over commercial ZSM-5 (Xue et al., 2016). Thermal interaction between the biomass feedstock (cellulose/lignin) and PE was observed before the catalytic upgrading took place. The thermal interaction improved the quality of the intermediates from the biomass and PE and produced smaller molecules, which were able to diffuse through the catalyst pores. The combination of the thermal and chemical synergies contributed to the high hydrocarbon yields and low residues. To maximize the oil yield and increase the synergistic interaction between the biomass constituents (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) with LDPE, Dongxue et al. proposed a two-step pyrolysis setup 1) cellulose and hemicellulose pyrolysis with LDPE at low temperature; 2) lignin and the unpyrolysed LDPE pyrolysis at high temperature using a commercial ZSM-5 catalyst (Yu et al., 2019). This procedure was proposed to avoid the possible over-cracking (gasification) of cellulose and hemicellulose-derived volatiles at high temperatures and insure the complete LDPE pyrolysis. Moreover, the use of untreated commercial ZSM-5 had drawbacks, such as lack of deoxygenation active sites and diffusion limitation through the catalyst pores. Studies based on commercial ZSM-5 were summarised in Table 1 . In the following sections, the discussion will be on the proposed modifications to address the aforementioned drawbacks and its effect on the reaction pathway."
3,Co-pyrolysis over ZSM-5 compared to other catalysts,"2.2 Co-pyrolysis over ZSM-5 compared to other catalysts Few studies compared the performance of ZSM-5 and other large pore zeolites such as HY and HBEA (Kim et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Park et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018a,b). The mass transfer limitation and reactants diffusion are among the major challenges of biomass pyrolysis (Filiciotto et al., 2018). Kim et al. co-pyrolysed cellulose with LDPE and PP, ZSM-5 exhibited better results in terms of aromatics yield compared to HY at high pyrolysis temperature and catalyst/feedstock ratio (10:1). They attributed aromatics yield to the strong acidity of ZSM-5 at high temperatures and an excess amount of active sites. In contrast, HY zeolite performed better than ZSM-5 at low temperatures with less catalyst loading. They have also addressed the role of the molecular size of the plastic co-feeding in enhancing the production of aromatics. The aromatics yield from LDPE co-pyrolysis was higher than PP, which was explained by their smaller molecular size, which facilitated the accessibility to the active sites. The higher activity of ZSM-5 over HY in aromatics production has also been discussed by Park et al. (2018) during the co-pyrolysis of mandarin peel with HDPE. Besides the known reaction pathway of converting furans to aromatics through the Diels-Alder reaction over ZSM-5, the pyrolysis of mandarin peel produced a large amount of methanol, where the performance of ZSM-5 has been widely demonstrated in converting methanol to olefins and aromatics (Bjørgen et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2015), which explained the high aromatics yields over ZSM-5. The pore size played a pivotal role in defining the final products based on the shape selectivity. The catalytic pyrolysis of mandarin peel on HY resulted in coke compared to ZSM-5 due to the larger pore size, promoting oligomerization. In the meantime, the pyrolysis of HDPE over HY produced a higher amount of branched aromatics; meanwhile, BTX were the major aromatics produced over ZSM-5. The same conclusion was reached by Zhang et al. when they studied the co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse with bio-plastic over ZSM-5 and USY separately (Zhang et al., 2018a,b). Zeolite pore structure plays an essential role in biomass to aromatics conversion in addition to zeolite acidity. Lee et al. investigated the co-pyrolysis of cellulose with PP using a high acid density HBEA with Si/Al ratio of 12.5 and compared the results with ZSM-5 (Lee et al., 2016). ZSM-5 produced a higher yield of aromatics than the BEA. The shape selectivity and the pore structure of ZSM-5 together with high acidity were the critical features (Jae et al., 2011). The work also highlighted the importance of cellulose thermal pre-treatment in enhancing BTX yield. The cellulose was initially torrified before catalytic co-pyrolysis with PP resulting in more aliphatic intermediates. The open-chain structure of the cellulose achieved after the torrification facilitated the production of intermediates, which reacted with olefins and favoured the formation of BTX. Table 2 lists all the comparative studies of ZSM-5 with other types of catalysts. These studies through the reaction mechanism revealed that ZSM-5 induced the aromatization reaction releasing additional hydrogen, which was consumed in hydrogenation of phenolic compounds and produced more aromatics. Thus ZSM-5 was the most frequently selected as favourable catalyst for biomass co-pyrolysis. Zeolites with large pore sizes such as BEA and MCM-41 could be potential catalysts as bulky oxygenates easily access the active sites. To explore the role of acidity, Morais et al. assessed the performance of two different Si/Al ratios of BEA zeolite in co-pyrolysis of eucalyptus woodchips with LDPE (Morais et al., 2019). Typically, zeolite acidity can be classified based on the strength, density and type, where each of these subcategories has their particular influence on the reaction pathway (Weitkamp and Hunger, 2007). The change in Si/Al ratio of BEA zeolite exhibited multiple and significant changes in the acid distribution (Brønsted and Lewis) as well as the strength and density. Pyrolysis with high Al content zeolites promotes mild cracking due to the high acid sites density and moderate strength. The strong acidity favoured the Diels-Alder reaction route increasing the concentration of the aromatics in the products and decreased the bio-oil yield. Studies on the effect of the catalyst to the feedstock ratio (C/F) revealed that the bio-oil yield increases with the increase of C/F ratio. Further increase C/F ratio caused a decrease in hydrocarbon yield due to severe cracking promoted by the excess amount of active site. To give more insight into the role of acidity in biomass co-pyrolysis, Chi et al. performed the pyrolysis of a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and PP using MCM-41 and Al-MCM-41 (Chi et al., 2018). Aluminum was introduced to the typical mesoporous MCM-41 to provide more acid sites. High synergistic interaction observed between the cellulose and PP over Al-MCM-41, especially toward producing more olefins as well as aromatics compared to MCM-41. The strong acidity provided by the presence of Al enhanced the cracking of oxygenated compounds. Consequently, the small cracked molecules of oxygenates such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids diffused easily into the pores of Al-MCM-41 and reacted with Brønsted and Lewis sites. The oxygen had been eliminated by different kinds of reactions, including dehydration, decarbonylation and decarboxylation and released in the form of H2O, CO and CO2, respectively. The deoxygenated intermediates were further reacted via hydrocarbon pool mechanism and produced olefins and aromatics. The study also discussed other scenarios where the furans and olefins reacted through Diels-Alder mechanism and formed monocyclic aromatics. However, theses monocyclic aromatics undesirably went through oligomerization reaction with furans and formed char. The high probability of oligomerization is one of the major drawbacks of the large pore catalysts since it increases the production of char and decreases other valuable products. Due to the abundance of natural zeolites, Solak et al. investigated the performance of three different clays namely montmorillonite K10, KSF – montmorillonite KSF, B – Bentonite in co-pyrolysis of cellulose with PE (Solak and Rutkowski, 2014). Among these three catalysts, montmorillonite K10 showed the best performance due to its high surface area, which facilitated the accessibility to the active sites. The liquid yield over montmorillonite K10 was much higher compared to montmorillonite KSF and Bentonite. In terms of bio-oil quality, montmorillonite K10 with weak Brønsted and strong Lewis active sites promoted the deoxygenation of anhydrosugars to form levoglucosenone (LGO), hydroxylactone (LAC) and 2-furfural (FF). Minimizing the catalyst cost is the critical factor to bring the co-feeding process to economically feasible levels together with utilizing cheap hydrogen sources to upgrade the quality of bio-oil. Hence, LOSA-1, spent FCC, γ-Al2O3, and sand, which are relatively inexpensive and commercially available catalysts, had been deployed to catalyse black-liquor lignin with different waste plastics (polyethylene, PE; polypropylene PP; polystyrene, PS) (Zhang et al., 2015b). The highest yield of aromatics and olefins was observed over LOSA-1due to the presence of ZSM-5 in the mixture. The petrochemicals yield over the remaining catalysts was in the following order spent FCC > Gamma-Al2O3 > sand. PS produced the highest aromatics yield, while PE yielded the lowest amount. These results are contradicting with the data reported previously by Dorado et al. (2015). The difference can be explained by the nature of the biomass and the type of intermediates achieved in each case, influencing the reaction path and the final product selectivity. The above section on the different catalysts revealed some of the weaknesses of the catalysts. The large pore-system catalysts enhance the diffusion into the catalyst channels; however, they tend to allow the final products to oligomerize on the external surface. Consequently, this oligomerization obstructs the accessibility to the active sites and deactivate the catalyst. Catalysts with the low surface area are undesirable for the co-pyrolysis."
4,Co-pyrolysis over hierarchical catalysts,"2.3 Co-pyrolysis over hierarchical catalysts The diffusion limitation and coke deposition are among the top challenges in biomass pyrolysis; mesoporosity presents a favourable solution to resolve these issues. Introducing the mesoporosity on the zeolite surface by post-synthesis treatment widely alters the acidity, the reaction pathway and intermediates stabilization. Tuning catalyst porosity is highly required to enhance the diffusion and maintain intimate contact between the reactants and active sites. Post-synthesis treatment including desilication and dealumination is an effective way to create mesoporosity; however, it results in a significant alteration in acidic properties. The changes in acidity could have a beneficial effect on the reaction pathway due to the combination of the mesoporosity and better acidity distribution. In contrast, the demetalation could lead to an increase of unfavourable active sites, which might be detrimental to the reaction pathway. ZSM-5 desilication, which developed by Hong et al., by treating commercial catalysts with NaOH could be an excellent example for the combination of these two advantages (Hong et al., 2017). The results showed an improvement in the catalytic activity during co-pyrolysis of cellulose with PP producing high aromatics yield. The treatment altered the mesoporosity for better diffusion without changing the strong acidity. The desilication had only increased the amount of weak acid sites enhancing the yield of liquid products. Furthermore, the increment in weak acidity considerably promoted the deoxygenation of furan compounds by reacting with olefins and produced more aromatics. To confirm the critical role of acid active sites in the co-pyrolysis reaction, the group compared the performance of Al-SBA-15 having high mesoporosity and poor acidity, with the performance of microporous and mesoporous ZSM-5. Al-SBA-15 showed poor catalytic performance than the microporous ZSM-5 due to the low density of active sites. The exceptional catalytic activity of microporous ZSM-5 was also observed by Kim et al during a comparative study on co-pyrolysis of torrefied yellow poplar with HDPE (Kim et al., 2017a,b) and mesoporous material Al-MCM-41. In contrast, the formation of mesoporosity by post-synthesis treatment of ZSM-5 zeolite with sodium carbonate significantly decreased the aromatics yield during the co-pyrolysis of pubescens and LDPE (Liu et al., 2010). There was an increment increase in liquid yield, which was directly proportional to the treatment time as the longer treatment time afforded further desilication. According to TPD results, the post-treatment reduced the amount of strong acidity but increased the weak acidity. This dramatic change in acidity was the reason behind the increment of liquid yield. High alkane yield was observed with a significant reduction in alkene and aromatics yield. The weak acidity in the desilicated ZSM-5 samples favoured the liquefaction and the strong acidity in the parent ZSM-5 catalysed the transformation of alkanes to alkenes and aromatics. Coupling acid density, strength and mesoporosity demonstrated the ideal solution to prolong the catalyst lifetime and enhance bio-oil yield. Suitable types of weak and strong acidity must be available in mesoporous zeolites to maximise the oil yield as evidenced in meso-MFI when compared to Al-SBA-15 and Al-MSU-F in co-pyrolysis of palm oil with PP (Shafaghat et al., 2019). The mesostructured Al-MSU-F has a large pore diameter of 14.4 nm compared with 5.9 and 4.2 nm in the case of Al-SBA-15 and meso-MFI, respectively. Al-MSU-F had the lowest acid density compared to other catalysts. The order of coke deposition was remarkably different in Al-SBA-15, which combined the low acidity concentration and small mesopore size resulting in the highest coke deposition. The combination of poor acidity with extra-large mesoporosity led to the minimum formation of coke over Al-MSU-F. Pore geometry of meso-MFI played an additional factor in addition to the improved diffusivity and adequate balance between the weak and strong acidity. The pore system of MFI promotes the synergetic interaction of co-pyrolysis intermediates of the biomass and plastic by enhancing the Diels-Alder reaction of furans with olefins and producing more aromatics. This inhibits oligomerization of the oxygenated intermediates, which is typically responsible for char and coke formation on the external surface of the catalyst. Aromatics yields over MFI and Y zeolites were 17 and 10%, respectively. Due to their difference in pore structure, Y zeolite failed to transfer the furans intermediates allowed them to polymerize into char and coke (34.8% solid residue) (Rezaei et al., 2017). A detailed study on co-pyrolysis of cellulose and PP over silica MCM-41 was carried out by Xue et al. (2017) using different product characterization techniques including Thermogravimetry–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG–FTIR) and pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py–GC–MS). The formation of furans was favoured than the saccharides in the cellulose decomposition, while cyclization and aromatization were promoted than the typical chain cracking of PP. The synergetic effect between the cellulose and PP resulted in high yields of alcohol and lower aromatics. The absence of strong acidity and the appropriate pore structure eliminated the further transformation of alcohols and olefins via the hydrocarbon pool to form more aromatics. Since the size of the mesopore plays a crucial role in vapour upgrading, Hassan et al. had excessively treated FAU zeolite with consecutive acid and alkaline treatment to create large mesopores on the external surface of the catalyst (Hassan et al., 2019). The average mesopore size of 45 nm was achieved with low total surface area (39.6 m2/g) due to the nature and the source of the FAU zeolite. Despite the low surface area, TPD results exhibited the presence of a considerable amount of strong acidity. The developed FAU catalyst was used to pyrolyze a mixture of sugarcane bagasse and waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The mesoporosity enabled access to the strong active sites promoting the hydrocarbon pool and deoxygenation reaction. The cracking and decomposition of biomass and HDPE were derived by thermal condition only due to the absence of any amount of weak acidity in the catalyst. Therefore, the group was able to substitute the deficiency in weak acidity by raising the pyrolysis temperature, the strong acidity led the bio-oil intermediates upgrading by a series of dehydration, decarbonylation, decarboxylation, and oligomerization reactions. However, a further increase of reaction temperature beyond 500 °C negatively affected the product upgrading due to the reverse Diels-Alder reaction, which favoured the production of olefins instead of aromatics."
5,Co-pyrolysis over elemental-modified catalysts,"2.4 Co-pyrolysis over elemental-modified catalysts Despite the excellent performance of zeolite as a catalyst for co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic, other strategies were introduced to improve hydrothermal stability, promote the hydrogen transfer reaction and maximise the deoxygenation rate. The introduction of different elements to the catalyst framework can alter zeolite hydrophobicity, acidity and basicity. To improve the hydrothermal stability and decrease the strong acidity of commercial ZSM-5, Lin et al. incorporated phosphorous to ZSM-5 framework by wet impregnation (Lin et al., 2015). The phosphorous modified ZSM-5 was tested for co-pyrolyze of poplar wood with HDPE. The phosphorous incorporation considerably decreased both strong and weak acidity. Based on TPD results, the reduction in acidity was directly proportional to P loading. The strong acidity was not observed at the highest P loading (10%). Although phosphorous provided hydrothermal stability to the structure, it lacked aromatization and deoxygenation capacity. Yuo et al. co-impregnated the phosphorous together with nickel to improve the strong acidity and promote the aromatization of olefins (Yao et al., 2015). The catalyst was prepared by wetness impregnation of phosphorous followed by second impregnation step with nickel before the calcination. However, the P/Ni-ZSM-5 had a lower acidity compared to P/ZSM-5 as observed by NH3-TPD. Combining the pyridine-FTIR results with NH3-TPD revealed that a considerable decrease in strong Brønsted acidity was experienced; at the same time, an increase in Lewis acidity was observed after dual impregnation. Because of these changes in acidity, the aromatics yield of co-pyrolysis of pine wood sawdust with LDPE increased, related to the increase of Lewis acidity. The increase of Lewis acidity and the presence of nickel promoted the dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins. The olefins had further participated in aromatization reaction enhancing the total aromatics yield. The hydrothermal stability of modified P/Ni-ZSM-5 was examined by steam pre-treatment before the co-pyrolysis reaction. Incorporation of metals/heteroatoms can play a role in controlling the pore size. For example, Zhou et al. incorporated boron to ZSM-5 by wet impregnation to narrow the pore size and enhance the selectivity of p-xylene over other types of aromatics (Zhou et al., 2014). Boron altered the acidity and textural properties of ZSM-5 reducing micropore and mesopore surface area and pore volume. The boron suppressed strong acidity while the weak acidity remained unchanged. At low boron loading (0.5–1 wt%), the aromatics yield was comparable to non-boron samples during the cellulose and LDPE co-pyrolysis. However, high yield of monoaromatics was obtained due to the shape selectivity of narrow pores. High boron loading caused the loss of textural and acidic properties. Gallium had been deployed to control the size of ZSM-5 pore to enhance the shape selectivity. Gallium can enhance the dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins and aromatics (Li et al., 2015). Unlike the previous work on boron, gallium was introduced by both in-situ method and wet impregnation. Gallium cations (Ga3+) remained on the ZSM-5 external surface due to its large cation size. In the in-situ method, gallium was converted to extra-framework species after the calcination. This non-framework gallium catalysed the alkanes derived from LDPE depolymerisation to olefins and subsequently to aromatics. The role of transition metals is to promote the decarboxylation (CO2) and decarbonylation (CO), and reduce dehydration (H2O), thereby retaining hydrogen in the liquid product (Iliopoulou et al., 2012). Because transition metals catalyse dehydrogenation, rates of hydrogen transfer from plastics pyrolysis vapour to biomass oxygenates can be higher compared to zeolites. Cobalt had been introduced over different supports (ZSM-5, CeO2, and Al2O3) for co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic (Chattopadhyay et al., 2016; Xiang et al., 2018). Although, the role of cobalt in promoting hydrogen transfer was not elaborated in detail. A clear trend was observed between the cobalt loading and hydrogen selectivity. The ability of transition metals to produce hydrogen was further confirmed when Ni and Pd were incorporated into Al-MCM-41 using in-situ hydrothermal synthesis route (Liu et al., 2013). The presence of each metal in Al-MCM structure showed higher selectivity to aromatics due to the increase of strong Lewis acidity. The cyclization and aromatization reactions had been promoted increasing the production of hydrogen compared to Al-MCM-41. A strong interaction between Ni and Pd on Al-MCM-41 altered the catalyst reducibility. The reaction pathway was shifted toward alternative routes whereby the alcohol and acetic acids underwent steam reforming rather than Diels-Alder reaction and produced more hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide. The above studies have shown that mesoporosity and transition metals incorporation played an important role in biomass co-pyrolysis. Kim et al. assessed the co-pyrolysis of PP and Laminaria japonica over Pt modified/mesoporous ZSM-5 and SBA-16 (Kim et al., 2017b) and reported higher rates of cracking and dehydrogenation (Park et al., 2012). Platinum dispersion over mesoporous structure facilitated a better interaction between the bulky oxygenates and hydrogen. Pt/mesoporous ZSM-5 exhibited higher deoxygenation and aromatics yield than the microporous ZSM-5. In addition to transition metals, metal oxides composed of transition metals have also been explored in co-pyrolysis biomass. A tandem bed of CeO2 and HSZM-5 was deployed to catalyse a corn stover and LDPE pyrolysis (Ding et al., 2018a). CeO2 promoted ketonization of aldehydes and acids during biomass decomposition. The depolymerisation of LDPE into alkanes and alkenes provided hydrogen donor intermediates, which underwent through series of reactions via Diels-Alder and hydrocarbon pool mechanism. CeO2 converted methoxy phenols into alkylated phenols that are diffused into ZSM-5 micropores forming aromatics and alkenes. Dual catalytic bed (metal oxides and ZSM-5) concept gained some attention as it provides several advantages. For instance, bulky oxygenates rapidly transform into small-chain molecules on the first catalytic bed (metal oxides) via deoxygenation reaction, and the resultant short-chain intermediates diffuse into the second catalytic bed (ZSM-5) where range of reactions proceed forming hydrocarbons (Azhar Uddin et al., 2008; Ding et al., 2018a,b; Fan et al., 2017a,b; Zhang et al., 2017). Ding et al. discussed the possible role and interaction of CaO in a dual bed catalytic pyrolysis xylan with LLDPE (Ding et al., 2018a,b). CaO catalysed active quasi-CO2 intermediates containing acetic acid, by pathways including neutralization, thermal cracking and catalytic cracking yielding ketones and hydrocarbons (Wang et al., 2010). Ketones were further subjected to aromatization over the second catalytic bed (ZSM-5). Interaction between LLDPE intermediates and basic metal oxides was negligible; thus, LLDPE intermediates reacted only over ZSM-5 catalyst via Diels-Alder reactions and hydrocarbon pool. The role of basic metal oxides was slightly different when lignin was co-fed with LDPE over consecutive beds of MgO and ZSM-5 (Fan et al., 2017a,b). Unlike cellulose, the decomposition of lignin produced phenolic compounds that are converted into alkyl phenols over MgO catalysts. Alkyl phenols are less desirable products than the aromatic hydrocarbons. Alkali earth metals (K, Na, Mg, and Ca) in the biomass cause irreversible zeolite deactivation. Ryu et al. suggested to impregnate the MgO over basic catalyst supports (C, Al2O3, and ZrO2), which are stable in the presence of ash and selective towards CO2 than CO and H2O (Ryu et al., 2019). MgO showed better decarboxylation rate due to optimum balance between acidic and basic Lewis sites (Hernando et al., 2017). In another study, a dual bed composed of MgCl2 and ZSM-5 was used by Xiangfei et al. pine sawdust co-pyrolysis with HDPE. The authors reported a notable increase in aromatics selectivity; however, they attributed only to the reaction of furans with olefins via Diels-Alder reaction (Bu et al., 2012; Fan et al., 2017a,b). Metal oxides have also been studied independently without zeolite catalysts. Lin et al. examined the activity of CaO, MgO, ZnO, and Fe2O3 for the poplar wood and PP co-pyrolysis (Lin et al., 2018). Among them, CaO demonstrated better deoxygenation (MgO > Fe2O3 > ZnO) due to the high basicity; but, CaO promoted coke formation reducing catalyst lifetime. CaO eliminated acids and furans in the product stream via ketonization of carboxylic acids. Although alkaline earth metal oxides have high basicity needed for ketonization, other reactions involving phenols, furans could not be catalaysed thus novel routes are needed to incorporate alkaline metal oxides (basic sites) to an acidic support. Table 3 gives a summary for all the studies where metals were incorporated or used as a catalyst. In summary, incorporation of metals enables a control over certain reactions but metals may block catalyst active sites thus mesoporose structure should be utilised. Furthermore, basicity originating from alkaline earth metals promotes better deoxygenation whereas transition metals facilitates hydrogen transfer reactions. Zeolite framework can be stabilised through the P and Ni incorporation which increases zeolite hydrophobicity."
6,Catalyst modifications effects on co-pyrolysis mechanism of biomass and plastics,"2.5 Catalyst modifications effects on co-pyrolysis mechanism of biomass and plastics Thermal co-pyrolysis of biomass with plastic offers process advantages compared to biomass pyrolysis mainly in plastic degradation temperatures. However, hydrogen transfer from plastic intermediates to biomass oxygenates require specific catalytic active sites. Co-pyrolysis involves several reactions occurring simultaneously. Catalysts play role in controlling certain reactions but specific active sites must be available. Among other reactions, cracking will be the first reaction to take place in the co-pyrolysis. Thermal pyrolysis of plastic produces wax unless solid acid catalyst is used to crack long chain compounds (Lee, 2012). Biomass decomposes into oxygenates that are larger than the kinetic diameter of medium-size pore zeolites like ZSM-5; hence, acid sites at the external surface (the pore mouth) must be accessible to crack bulky intermediates and allow them to enter the pore channels for further transformations (Jae et al., 2011). However, a high density of acid sites could cause excessive cracking leading to coke formation. The strength of acidity determines the acid sites efficiency. Strong acidity or high temperature acidity based on NH3-TPD is the favourable acidity for biomass conversion. Hierarchical zeolites have low acidity strength (Serrano et al., 2011) and consequently show poor catalytic activity compared to unmodified zeolites. Deoxygenation reactions (decarboxylation, decarbonylation and dehydration) proceed after the cracking reactions. Basic active sites can catalyse the deoxygenation reactions. The basicity in solid acid catalysts can be generated by incorporating of alkali and alkaline earth metals either by impregnation or ion exchange. Basic active sites promote transformation of carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones and alcohols into alkenes and alkanes, but basic sites have negligible effect on plastics pyrolysis. The concentration of the basic sites has to be low compared to acidic ones to avoid coke formation. After the deoxygenation, aromatization reactions take place where furans react with alkenes producing aromatics and water, which are the products of synergistic interaction between biomass and plastic intermediates. This step is significant as it deoxygenates furans yielding valuable aromatics. Unlike other reactions, furans aromatization require acidic sites and special pore geometry to enable the cycloaddition. ZSM-5 with the strong acidity is considered as the best catalyst for aromatization due to shape selectivity to aromatics (Cheng and Huber, 2012). Furthermore, ketonization also takes place involving two molecules of carboxylic acids to form ketone. Transformation of ketones to alkanes is possible if catalytic active sites are still available. Ketonization is not the ideal reaction for complete elimination of oxygen but it reduces corrosiveness of bio-oil. Previous reports still debate on the reaction mechanism and the active sites (Pacchioni, 2014; Pham et al., 2013). In addition to ketonization, aldol condensation involving carbonyl and hydroxyl groups takes place (Wu et al., 2016); however, the role of acid and base sites for this reaction is controversial (Zhang et al., 2016a,b). Oligomerization reactions between phenolic intermediates produce condensed aromatics (coke) leading to liquid carbon loss. The oligomerization could happen in the vapour phase during the reaction or could rise in the quenched oil with time (Bai et al., 2014). The tendency of phenolic monomers to oligmerize is related to achieving thermodynamic stability. Phenolic intermediates can be stabilised by hydrogen transfer reactions through the synergistic interaction in co-pyrolysis (Mullen et al., 2018). Hydrogen is likely to be the product of dehydrogenation and cyclization of alkanes derived from plastic (Mu et al., 2020). The presence of both acidic site and transition metals is necessary to promote the dehydrogenation (Akubo et al., 2019). To enhance synergistic interaction between plastic and biomass intermediates, novel catalysts with two or more functional active sites are necessary. The future work on catalyst design should be directed toward incorporating multi-functional active sites."
7,Co-pyrolysis of biomass with the solid hydrogen-rich additives (Tyres and scums),"In this section, biomass co-pyrolysis with other hydrogen–rich solid wastes is discussed. Wang et al. (2017a–c) reported high aromatics yield with negligible coke during the co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste tyres over commercial ZSM-5. Reaction between furans and olefins led to the enhanced aromatics yield. Coke formation was inhibited as tyre-derived hydrogen stabilised biomass oxygenates. Some formed coke was believed to be originating from hydrocarbon radicals. Contrary to plastic pyrolysis, the natural rubber decomposes into large molecule olefins such as D-limonene,1,3-pentadiene, and 2-butene that are high value products (Song et al., 2017). Parejo et al. used CaO as catalyst during co-pyrolysis of grape seeds and waste tyres (Sanahuja-Parejo et al., 2018). In addition to Diels-alder reaction, the study attributed the aromatics enhancement to a sequence of hydrogenation, aromatization, polymerization and oligomerization reactions together with chain-end scission mechanism. Zhang et al. investigated the co-pyrolysis of corn stalk with food waste using commercial ZSM-5 catalyst (Zhang et al., 2015a,b). Unfortunately, food waste has low hydrogen to carbon ratio (H/Ceff) compared to plastic or tyres (Dorado et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2011). However, co-feeing of food waste increases aromatics yield due to the presence of alcohol and alkenes derived from food waste pyrolysis (Kadlimatti et al., 2019). Coke formation was significant in food waste co-pyrolysis with ZSM-5 as formation of multi-ring aromatics were favoured. Xie et al (Xie et al., 2015) used a scum, solid waste from water treatment plant, in microalgae co-pyrolysis over commercial ZSM-5 catalysts. Components of scum including vegetable oils, waxes, and fats produced alkenes and subsequently converted into aromatics over ZSM-5 during the co-pyrolysis. Triglycerides derived from microalgae pyrolysis can also be the feedstock for aromatics. Scum co-pyrolysis over dual catalytic bed (CaO and ZSM-5) (Liu et al., 2016) (Dickerson and Soria, 2013; Lu et al., 2010) demonstrated the importance of sequential cracking in which sugar polymers deoxygenates over the mesoporous CaO at the first instance followed by catalytic reactions over ZSM-5. Co-pyrolysis of cedar wood and Loy Yang coal was catalysed by ultra-stable zeolite Y (USY) impregnated with metals (Mg, K, Na, Ce, Cu, Fe, and Mo) (Rizkiana et al., 2016). Magnesium due to its high CO2 adsorption capacity suppressed the formation of carboxylate – coke precursor. Table 4 lists the effective hydrogen index of solid co-feed materials and the optimum amount of catalyst in each study."
8,"Co-pyrolysis of biomass with gas and liquid types of hydrogen-rich additives (methane, alcohols, waste oil)","Hydrotreatment is well-known, established process to remove heteroatoms from crude oil and it can also be used for bio-crude upgrading to achieve high H/Ceff ratio (Piemonte et al., 2016). However, high hydrogen (700 L/kg of bio-oil) demand and high pressure processing pose economical and technical challenges to the feasibility of hydrotreatment (Bridgwater, 1996; Elliott and Neuenschwander, 1997). As such, exploiting hydrogen –rich feedstock (plastics, tyres) as hydrogen source would provide favourable outcome due to the easiness of integration and abundance of waste materials. But not all waste materials are suitable because of heterogeneity and impurities found in scum and municipal solid waste. In this respect, use of methane and alcohols as hydrogen source offers distinctive advantages over the heterogeneous waste materials."
9,Co-pyrolysis of biomass and methane,"4.1 Co-pyrolysis of biomass and methane Methane can be exploited as hydrogen donor for the biomass co-pyrolysis (Yang et al., 2016). Methane activation was reported over molybdenum catalysts involving MoO → MoCx reactions followed by methane dehydrogenation and coupling into ethylene. In some studies, ZSM-5 promoted the oligomerization of ethylene to benzene (Tessonnier et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2003). Co-pyrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin with methane was examined by Yang et al. over ZSM-5 and Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts. Cellulose and hemicellulose conversion into aromatics in the presence of methane was negligible; however, lignin-derived phenols were selectively converted into aromatics (Mo/ZSM-5). The route to aromatics involved dehydration, demethylation and transalkylation of phenols and guaiacols (Srinivasan et al., 2012). The study suggested methane provided hydrogen directly to the lignin-derived intermediates through steam reforming over ZSM-5 catalysts. Another study on co-pyrolyse of lignin/yellow poplar and methane using Mo, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn/HZSM-5 revealed synergy between feedstocks which favoured aromatics yield. (Shafaghat et al., 2018). Authors postulated that all metals/HZSM-5 excluding molybdenum converted methane into olefins that subsequently reacted with furans yielding aromatics via Diels-Alder mechanism. Although, the formation of olefins under the reaction conditions is unlikely, and no clear evidence of olefins in the product stream was given in their study. Methane activation (either oxidative or non-oxidative coupling) by molybdenum catalysts requires reaction temperatures around 1200 K and 973 K, respectively (Jiang et al., 1999; Keller and Bhasin, 1982; Otsuka et al., 1986); thus it would be unattainable under the pyrolysis conditions. Since the dehydration is the most dominant reaction in biomass pyrolysis, oxidation of methane with steam is the potential pathway for methane activation."
10,Co-pyrolysis of biomass and alcohol,"4.2 Co-pyrolysis of biomass and alcohol While the conversion of methane is challenging due to its inherent stability (Kulkarni et al., 2018; Ravi et al., 2019), the transformation of methanol to olefins and aromatics has been widely demonstrated (Ahmed et al., 2019; Ahmed et al., 2017). The transformation of methanol to hydrocarbons happens at the same temperature range as biomass pyrolysis, 350 – 550 °C. An investigation into the synergistic co-feeding of methanol and palm kernel shell over ZSM-5 has been reported (Asadieraghi and Wan Daud, 2015). Synergistic effects were observed including the increased yield of aromatics and the reduced water content. Phenol deoxygenation was identified as the reason for the reduction in phenol, which in turn increased the yields of aromatics. Horne et al. also reported a similar increase in the yield of alkylated aromatics (Horne et al., 1995). Another study focused on the co-pyrolysis of furans and alcohol (methanol/ethanol) with commercial ZSM-5 also found the increased yield of aromatics (Zheng et al., 2014). The olefins such as ethylene and propylene from the primary reaction of methanol was found to react with furans via Diels-Alder reaction to produce more aromatics. Catalyst deactivation by the deposition of coke during co-pyrolysis of methanol and biomass is common. Fundamental research based on nickel impregnated ZSM-5 (Ni-ZSM-5) to study the mechanism of coke formation was reported by Valle et al. (Valle et al., 2012). The study found that the coke was composed of polymerized reaction intermediates. The porosity and crystal size of catalysts play a significant role in the transport of reactants and products through the catalyst channels (Chen et al., 2017). As discussed in previous sections, catalytic active sites are not accessible for large molecules due to limited diffusion (Hassan et al., 2016). Moreover, studies with the different crystal sizes of ZSM-5 revealed that the nanocrystalline catalyst achieved much better conversion and aromatic selectivity compared to macrosized catalyst (Wang et al., 2019). This was attributed to the higher surface area of the nanocrystalline catalyst as well as a better access to the active sites. Such higher interaction over nano-ZSM-5 also caused higher degree of deoxygenation reactions compared to the larger crystals. In addition, allocation of mesopores in a core-shell structure was found to enhance the yield of BTEX and deoxygenation, which also showed the significance of diffusion in co-pyrolysis of biomass and alcohol. Researchers attempted to elucidate synergistic interaction between biomass-derived intermediates and hydrogen donor alcohol. Zhang et al. implemented isotopic labelling during catalytic co-pyrolysis of corn stover and fusel alcohol over commercial ZSM-5 (Zhang et al., 2018a,b). Same labelling method was also used by Dorado et al. to confirm the synergy between cellulose and PE (Dorado et al., 2015). Based on the isotopic labelling, aromatics were formed by the carbon and hydrogen atoms from both feedstock. Moreover, the formation of the aromatics were explained by Diels-Alder and hydrocarbon pool mechanisms. It is worth noting that there was inconsistency between theoretical and experimental results based on Diels-Alder reaction mechanism. Thus, it was found that the hydrocarbon pool mechanism was the dominating pathway to form aromatics during catalytic co-processing. A possible explanation might be that the furans from cellulose can react with olefins via Diels-Alder mechanism, but not with lignin-derived molecules. The dominance of hydrocarbon pool mechanism was further shown by Zhang et al. by tracing 12C from pine wood and 13C from methanol in a catalytic co-pyrolysis over commercial spray dried 40% ZSM-5 (Zhang et al., 2012). Synergistic interaction between biomass intermediates and methanol was confirmed the enhancement of aromatics yields. Synergistic interactions between alcohols and biomass are comparable to the plastics (LDPE and PP). Alcohol offers competitive advantages as it reacts directly with the catalyst. Plastics on the other hand use large amount of energy for the first step of depolymerisation. Alcohols however produce water in such reaction conditions, which could be challenging for the stability of the catalysts."
11,Co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste oil,"4.3 Co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste oil Waste oil, if not managed properly, can contaminate soil and water sources (Xu et al., 2016). The recycling and reusing of waste lubricant oil as well as catalytic transformation into valuable fuels have been explored. Co-processing of waste oil with biomass also offers an alternative where waste oil could act as hydrogen source to improve bio-oil quality. Wang et al. investigated the co-pyrolysis of mushroom waste with waste cooking oil using commercial ZSM-5 catalyst (Wang et al., 2016). The waste oil contributed to the enhanced yield of aromatics. In another study, residual bamboo and waste lubricating oil was co-pyrolysed over a dual bed of MgO and ZSM-5 (Wang et al., 2017a–c). Improved decarboxylation due to the basicity of MgO was found to favour the ketonization reactions. Thus, the higher degree of deoxygenation by MgO together with aromatization by ZSM-5 resulted in the increased conversion of lignin derived phenols to aromatics. Meanwhile, cellulose-derived furans reacted with olefins from waste oil to form aromatics via Diels-Alder and hydrocarbon pool mechanism. Growing interest in the co-feeding of waste oil with biomass has led researchers investigating synergies during co-processing of rice straw and stearic acid, gutter oil or microalgae oil. Catalytic co-pyrolysis of those feedstock over different ZSM-5s consistently resulted in higher amounts of aromatics."
12,Catalytic co-pyrolysis process design considerations,"The process considerations for the design of catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) have been summarized elsewhere (Dayton et al., 2015; Iisa et al., 2017; Iisa et al., 2018; Yildiz et al., 2016), in this section those considerations are extended to co-pyrolysis. A key driver for co-pyrolysis is to add value by unlocking synergies that wouldn’t exist when processing the feeds separately (Abnisa and Daud, 2014; Hassan et al., 2016). The main design choices for catalytic co-pyrolysis relate to feedstocks, catalyst, reactor technology, operating mode and process parameters, see Table 5 (Jahirul et al., 2012). Co-pyrolysis research has focused on agricultural residues, wood residues, municipal solid wastes, plastics, tires and dedicated energy crops(Abnisa and Daud, 2014). Low or negative value feeds will probably be preferred in commercial projects. However, low value feeds have characteristics which make them challenging to process – including contaminants, mineral matter and variable quality, for example. Agricultural residues have high mineral matter content which can severely deactivate catalysts (Yildiz et al., 2015). MSW residues contain co-mingled plastics and PVC with significant quantities of chlorine and which melt and pyrolyze at different temperatures than woody biomass residues (Xue et al., 2015). When plastics are considered for co-pyrolysis, the potential of adverse effects from melting and agglomeration should be considered. Feeding systems may need to be cooled in order to avoid plugging problems (Valle et al., 2007). Although cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and plastics have different polymeric structures, co-pyrolysis can transform them into similar aromatic and olefin products (Elsayed and Eseyin, 2016; Li et al., 2015). The selection of the catalyst for co-pyrolysis will ultimately determine the process parameters, including temperature, pressure, catalyst:feed ratio and regeneration requirements. The catalyst should limit coking, non-condensable gas production and facilitate deoxygenation. Since co-pyrolysis aims to maximize oil yield and quality, fast pyrolysis is preferred with the most common reactor designs being: rotating cone, fluidized beds (bubbling, circulating, spouted) and augers (Perkins et al., 2018). The rotating cone reactor has been commercialized for processing biomass, but there is no literature on using it with catalysts and co-pyrolysis. Bubbling fluidized beds have been used extensively in co-pyrolysis research, however some potential challenges for commercial use include melting and agglomeration issues and ensuring low residence times to maximize yields. Circulating fluidized beds have been used in both research and commercial applications. One advantage of circulating fluidized beds is that the feeds can be injected at different heights along the riser, thereby enabling the residence time of each to be optimized. Spouted fluidized beds have been investigated extensively for fast pyrolysis (Alvarez et al., 2015). A 25 kg/hr conical spouted bed pilot plant has been constructed in Spain. This reactor technology can handle solids of irregular size and texture, has good heat transfer and low pressure drop, making it a good candidate for co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics (Fernandez-Akarregi et al., 2013). Auger reactors have demonstrated the ability to deliver high bio-oil yields (Henrich et al., 2016) and have been used for studying CFP at the mini-plant scale. Auger reactors have low requirements for carrier and fluidization gas, though the management of catalyst attrition and regeneration will require further attention during process scale-up. A key decision is whether to use an in-situ catalytic pyrolysis configuration, where the catalyst comes into contact with the feed or an ex-situ configuration where the catalyst is used to upgrade the pyrolysis vapours. For feedstocks with very high mineral matter and high levels of contaminants, ex-situ pyrolysis will be required. This configuration has the advantage that pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading functions can be operated under different conditions (eg. temperature) so that the overall process can be optimized. The optimum temperature for co-pyrolysis will be different to that for single feed pyrolysis. For example, Xue et al. found that higher temperatures were required to optimize co-pyrolysis of red oak and HDPE in a fluidized bed (Xue et al., 2015). Most fast pyrolysis research has been conducted at atmospheric pressure in order to evolve a simple, low-cost commercial reactor system. Several processes have been proposed that operate at higher pressures (10–30 bar) with hydrogen addition in order to improve deoxygenation and produce higher quality bio-oils (Singh et al., 2012). The IH2® technology uses a first stage fluidized bed with a second stage fixed bed hydro-conversion catalyst and would be adaptable to co-pyrolysis."
13,In-situ catalytic fast co-pyrolysis,"5.1 In-situ catalytic fast co-pyrolysis Yildiz et al. (2016) have reported process flow scheme for in-situ catalytic fast co-pyrolysis. The catalyst is circulated between the pyrolysis reactor and regenerator, performing simultaneously the functions of providing heat and catalysing the endothermic pyrolysis reactions. The upgraded vapours from the pyrolysis reactor are condensed forming liquids which are further separated into bio-crude and an aqueous phase. Spent catalyst and unconverted char from the reactor are sent to the regenerator to reheat the catalyst and remove coke. Excess char may be removed from the solids or combusted in the regenerator to provide additional steam. Regenerated catalyst is recycled to the pyrolysis reactor, typically with the aid of non-condensable gases (NCGs). The NCGs are generally used as fuel gas to make steam in a waste heat boiler. Low grade heat in the exhaust gases and/or steam can be used to dry the incoming feedstock to optimal conditions. In-situ CFP has been developed to pilot scale (Iliopoulou et al., 2014) and is most suitable for feedstocks with low mineral matter content, such as the combination of wood derived biomass and various plastics."
14,Ex-situ catalytic fast co-pyrolysis,"5.2 Ex-situ catalytic fast co-pyrolysis When the feedstocks to be processed have a high mineral matter content or contain contaminants that would severely deactivate the catalyst, the ex-situ CFP scheme can be selected, details of ex-situ CFP process flow was reported elsewhere (Yildiz et al., 2016). In this scheme, pyrolysis is undertaken thermally using a heat carrier such as sand which is circulated between the primary pyrolysis reactor and a combustor. The primary pyrolysis vapours are upgraded via catalytic reactions in a subsequent reactor. If rapid catalyst deactivation and coking occurs, the catalyst is circulated to/from a regenerator, however if deactivation and coking is moderate, upgrading in a fixed bed of catalyst may be considered. The upgraded vapours are condensed forming liquids which are further separated into bio-crude and an aqueous phase. NCGs are used as carrier gases to aid the circulation and fluidization of the solids. Ex-situ CFP is most suited to feedstocks with a high mineral matter and/or high contaminant loadings such as MSW combined with agriculturally derived biomasses. In the configuration, sand could be replaced with a catalyst, to enable primary catalytic co-pyrolysis followed by vapour upgrading in a second step."
15,Conclusion,"Co-pyrolysis of biomass with hydrogen-rich feedstock is an inexpensive and efficient process for enhancing bio-oil quality. The complicated chemistry of the reaction needs to be explored carefully to design effective, robust and multifunctional catalysts. The major scope of this review is to link the catalyst modification and its functionality in changing and controlling the reaction pathway. Review guides the future work in selecting the best catalyst arrangement based on the type of biomass and co-feed. The review also discusses process designs used in co-pyrolysis studies including in-situ and ex-situ catalyst configuration, feedstock integration and catalyst regeneration."
