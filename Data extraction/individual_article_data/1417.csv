0,Introduction,"The health welfare can be obtained by the appropriate administration of live probiotics through keeping microorganisms balance in human gastrointestinal tract, guarding against some diseases, enhancing host immune system ((Albertini et al., 2010); Cook, Tzortzis, Charalampopoulos, & Khutoryanskiy, 2012; Heidebach, Först, & Kulozik, 2009), even affecting the brain processes and behavior (Mayer, Tillisch, & Gupta, 2015). As is known to all, if viable probiotic is in the sufficient amount, the full functionality and health effects can be put on display. Nevertheless, the survival ability of probiotics is seriously impeded by hostile environment conditions (Champagne, Raymond, Guertin, & Bélanger, 2015; Fu & Chen, 2011; Schell & Beermann, 2014). It is also worth pointing out that Hence, the encapsulation of probiotics can protect them against unfavorable conditions in the gastro-intestinal (GI) and allow them to be released in the targeted area (e.g., intestine), thus maximizing absorption by the human body (Ashraf & Shah, 2014). In recent years, it has been proved that microencapsulation is a perspective method, like extrusion, emulsification, and spray drying have been applied to the protection of probiotic cells. (Anekella & Orsat, 2013; Coghetto, Brinques, & Ayub, 2016; Mandal & Hati, 2017; Silva et al., 2016). However, these microencapsulation techniques have their own deficiencies, such as the using of high temperature or organic solvent may lead to significant death of probiotic cells (Eratte et al., 2015; Salar-Behzadi et al., 2013). In the process of electrospinning, an external electric field was applied to upon polymer solution or melt, hence, continuous polymer fibers were produced and the diameters range were from sub to micrometer (Feng et al., 2017; Wen et al., 2016). Generally, all electrospinning processes are conducted at room temperature with simple instruments. In addition, the electrospinning nanofibers obtained have many excellent characteristics, such as large surface area to volume ratio, high porosity, and excellent mechanical properties (Wen et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017). Probiotics encapsulated in electrospinning nanofibers also showed enhanced stability and functionality; hence, these nanofiber materials have gained special attention (Ghorani, Russell, & Goswami, 2013). Additionally, even though many polymers were dissolved in organic solvents for subsequent electrospinning, through altering the process parameters and/or adjusting the solution composition by adding suitable additives, there were some biopolymers dissolved in aqueous solution can also be electrospinning (Lopez-Rubio, Sanchez, Wilkanowicz, Sanz, & Lagaron, 2012). On account of surface-active, natural biopolymers include proteins and polysaccharides are treated as excellent encapsulation matrices and aroused great interest. Moreover, natural polymers and biodegradable polymers have become attractive as suitable materials for environmental conservation (Torres, Martinez, Ocio, & Lagaron, 2010). Many highly functional materials have been developed in various industries by mixing different polymers. Recently, several studies used electrospinning to encapsulate probiotic bacteria via food grade polymers and biopolymers. For instance, Kun Feng et al. (Feng, Zhai, Zhang, et al., 2018) used fructooligosaccharides (FOS) as the material for electrospinning to encapsulate the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum in the nanofibers. Because the 2.5% (w/w) FOS was selected as embedding material, the survival rate of cells was obviously increased (1.1 log) (P < 0.001). In addition, both free and encapsulated cells were treated by moist heat (60°C and 70 °C), the viability of encapsulated cells in FOS/PVA/L. plantarum nanofibers compared with free cells was evidently improved. Zafer Ceylan et al. (Zafer, Raciye, Canan, & D., & Tahsin, Y. M., 2018) used polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate to encapsulate probiotic bacteria (L. rhamnosus) by electrospinning technique, and the TMABc and TPBc growth were delayed in fish fillets with effect by using VS and VSPBe up to 38% through the microbiological experiments. The electrospinning process reinforced the probiotic bacteria survival rate, therefore the L. rhamnosus-loaded nanofibers was considered as a emerging technologies to delay the microbial viability in the fish fillets. Generally, the repeat amino acid sequence (Gly-Ser-Gly-AlaGly-Ala)n is the main component of silk fibroin. In the field of biodegradable and biocompatible polymer materials, SF has been widely taken advantage of in biomedical area because of its unique biocompatibility, biodegradability and minimal inflammatory response. (Altman et al., 2003). Because the fibers and films of silk fibroin (SF) have good biocompatibility, they are suitable for use as biomaterials. However, SF films are very brittle. Therefore, flexible blend films consisting of SF and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which is a non-toxic water-soluble synthetic polymer, have been made by casting. PVA has a good film-forming ability and is widely used in biochemical and medical applications. In this paper, the main target of the study was for the first time to obtain Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum)-loaded polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinyl alcohol/silk fibroin (PVA/SF)-based nanofibers. To this end, PVA and PVA/SF were seleccted as nanofibers carriers, and L. plantarum were encapsulated into PVA and PVA/SF by taking advantage of electrospinning. Then, the influence of different ratios of PVA and SF on the characteristics of the probiotic was also investigated. The obtained nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and the viability of encapsulated cells in simulated gastric juice was compared with free cells."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade. Silk fibroin (SF), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, retained molecular weight: 1750 ± 50 Da), Pepsin, hydrochloric acid (HCl)，MRS broth were purchased from Aladdin company (China, www.aladdin-e.com). Deionized water was used in all experiments."
3,The fabrication of electrospinning nanofibers,"2.2 The fabrication of electrospinning nanofibers First, 1.6 g PVA was weighed, and 10 mL sterile deionized water added. The mixture was heated and stirred until dissolved in an oil bath and then cooled to room temperature. Similarly, 1.2 g silk fibroin was weighed, 10 mL sterile deionized water added and stirred until dissolved at room temperature. Finally, both solutions were mixed and stirred until smooth. The frozen bacteria L. plantarum (−80 °C) was inoculated into 30 μL MRS broth and cultured at 37 °C for 20 h under the condition of aerobic. Then, 1.0 mL culture was pipetted into 100 mL fresh MRS broth and incubated at the same conditions. After incubation, the bacteria were collected through centrifuging 9000 rpm for 5.0 min under room temperature, and the bacteria were washed twice with pure water. Finally, the bacteria were redissolved in 2.0 mL pure water and mixed with the PVA/SF and PVA solution for electrospinning, respectively. Production of electrospinning nanofibers was applied after the preparation of L. plantarum and PVA/SF mixed solutions. The specific steps of electrospinning are as follows: Firstly, injecting PVA/SF/L. plantarum electrospinning solution into glass syringe with 0.5 mm steel needle and the tip was flat. Secondly, the electrospinning conditions was set up following: 24 kv anodic voltage, 2.0 mL/h feed rate, 18 cm distance between needle tip and the collector, and the nanofiber was gathered on the collector as shown in Fig. 1 ."
4,Determination of nanofiber morphology by scanning electron microscopy,"2.3 Determination of nanofiber morphology by scanning electron microscopy The images of samples were carried out under low vacuum on a field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi, S-3400 N, Japan) with a working distance of 8 mm."
5,Molecular characterization by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,2.4 Molecular characterization by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was applied to determine the changes of nanofibers' chemical structure.
6,Thermogravimetric analysis,"2.5 Thermogravimetric analysis The influence of SF on the thermal behavior of PVA/L. plantarum and PVA/SF/L. plantarum was observed by the advantage of Thermogravimetric analyzer, TGA (TG 209 F3, NETZSCH, Germany). The flow of continuous nitrogen for nanofibers thermogravimetric analyses was 20 mL/min, and the temperature range is from 25 °C to 800 °C with 10 °C/min rate."
7,Vitality test,"2.6 Vitality test Artificial gastric juice was prepared according to Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2010: 16.4 mL hydrochloric acid, 800 mL distilled water and 10 g pepsin were mixed. Subsequently, distilled water was added to a final volume of 1000 mL. For the vitality experiment, 2.0 mg PVA/SF/L. plantarum composite nanofibers were added to 5.0 mL of prepared artificial gastric juice. After being stressed in artificial gastric juice for 2.0 h at 37 °C, the nanofibers were taken out and washed by distilled water for 3 or 4 times. Then, the composite nanofibers were placed in MRS medium and cultured at 37 °C. The optical density (OD)value was measured every 2 h, and the growth curve was drawn. Next, 2.0 mL free L. plantarum solution was centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. Free L. plantarum were washed with distilled water for 2 or 3 times and placed in the prepared artificial gastric solution at 37 °C for 2 h. The free L. plantarum were washed with distilled water 3 or 4 times, and transferred to MRS medium and cultured at the same conditions. The OD value was measured every 2 h, and the growth curve was also drawn."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Morphology of nanofibers,"3.1 Morphology of nanofibers Scanning electron microscopy images of polyvinyl alcohol-based nanofibers (PVA/L. plantarum) and L. plantarum-loaded polyvinyl alcohol and silk fibroin-based nanofibers (PVA/SF/L. plantarum) are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively. SEM images clearly reveal that smooth, cylindrical, and ultrafine nanofibers were fabricated. 3.1.1 The effect of different concentrations of PVA on electrospinning As shown in Fig. 2b and c, when the content of PVA in the mixed solution is 6.0% and 9.0%, the nanofibers show poor homogeneity. Additionally, and there are still serious adhesions and beads among them. The change of PVA concentration will change the viscoelasticity of the mixed solution and the surface tension of its droplets directly. When the PVA content was 6.0%, the viscosity of the mixed solution was low, due to the low polymer concentration. This caused the liquid jet to fracture during the electrospinning process, leading non-continuous and unstable nanofibers. When the PVA content was 9.0%, the viscosity and surface tension of the mixed solution were too high. In this case, the electric field force cannot overcome these properties, and a continuous liquid jet cannot be easily generated. Moreover, the viscosity of the electrospinning solution increased with the addition of the polymer, and as a result, the glass tube sleeve of the syringe become stuck and cannot could not function. Therefore, it can be seen from the above results that the content of PVA played an important role in the morphology of nanofibers. To obtain the single nanofiber with continuous and uniform morphology, the content of PVA was 8.0%, and the network space structure can be seen in Fig. 2d. 3.1.2 The influence of SF concentration on electrospinning The continuous and uniform PVA/L. plantarum nanofiber can be obtained at 8.0% PVA solution, however, the problem that exists and needs to be solved is that the electrospinning of PVA/L. plantarum is hard with a low success rate and the nanofiber membrane obtained is too thin to collect easily, as a result, subsequent experiments cannot be carried out. Therefore, silk fibroin was added to make up for this deficiency. Upon mixing, the formation of hydrogen bonds between the molecules of SF and PVA is enhanced by the polar groups in the solvent, so that the compatibility of the two components is significantly enhanced, and the success of electrospinning is improved (Zafer et al., 2018). However, the electrospinning efficiency of the mixed solution was not significantly changed until the SF concentration decreased to 4.0%. On the one hand, the viscosity of the mixed solution was insufficient at low concentrations, and the weak force exits between the molecular chains, resulting in insufficient surface tension; moreover, the proportion of water in the electrospinning solution is highly difficult to evaporate. Even though, the nanofibers have been observed by SEM, there are still many small beads and serious adhesion phenomenon between the nanofibers, as shown in Fig. 3c. Furthermore, the viscosity of the mixed solution increased with increasing SF concentration to 6% in the mixed solution, which enhanced the force between the molecular chains and changed the spinnability of the blend solution. As a result, the electrospinning solution more easily stretched in the external high-voltage electric field to form a fibrous structure, and the number of beads is also decreased, as shown in Fig. 3b. Finally, as the concentration of SF increased to 10%, the solution viscosity was higher, and the glass tube sleeve of the syringe was stuck and could not function. Hence, 6% was selected as the optimal concentration. The surface of PVA/L. plantarum nanofibers synthesized under ultrasonication appears quite smooth (Fig. 3(2)a). The nanofibers had an outer diameter of approximately 320 ± 150 nm. PVA/SF/L. plantarum nanofibers with smooth and uniform morphology and random orientation were generated with a mean diameter of 190 ± 70 nm (Fig. 3(2)b). As observed from the images, not only the mean diameter of PVA/SF/L. plantarum was thinner than PVA/L. plantarum, but also the amount of probiotic was larger. The addition of SF increased the yield of nanofibers, changed the diameter of nanofibers, and played a positive role in probiotics packaging."
10,Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) of nanofibers,"3.2 Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) of nanofibers FTIR was utilized to monitor changes in the chemical structure of nanofibers. Spectra of probiotic bacteria-loaded polyvinyl alcohol-based nanofibers (PVA/L. plantarum) and probiotic bacteria-loaded polyvinyl alcohol and silk fibroin-based nanofibers (PVA/SF/L. plantarum) are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The spectra of PVA/L. plantarum-based nanofiber showed peaks at 3412, 2911, and 1087 cm−1. The peak at 2911 cm−1 was attributed to the asymmetrical stretching of CH. The peak at 1087 cm−1 corresponds to the CO group, and the peak at 3412 cm−1 is characteristic of the OH group. Conversely, PVA/SF/L. plantarum-based nanofibers showed peaks at 500, 700, 1324, 1638, and 3381 cm−1 except for the previous. The peaks at 500, 700, and 1638 cm−1 correspond to the –CONH2 group. The peaks at 1324 cm−1 are characteristics of CN. Peaks at 3381 cm−1 are associated with CH vibrations. The results show that two kinds of molecular groups were detected in the mixed solution. The polypeptide groups of SF did not change, and SF and PVA interacted via molecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals force."
11,Thermal properties of nanofibers,"3.3 Thermal properties of nanofibers As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the weight loss (in mass) of both PVA/L. plantarum and PVA/SF/L. plantarum increased as the increasing of temperature. However, the weight loss of PVA/SF/L. plantarum was slower, compared to PVA/L. plantarum nanofibers. From 170 °C to 235 °C, the weight loss of PVA/SF/L. plantarum was 14%, but there was almost no weight loss in PVA/L. plantarum nanofibers at the same temperature. These differences may be based on the addition of SF that may provide less stability than the no addition in the range of 170 °C to 235 °C. However, the majority of weight loss in PVA/L. plantarum and PVA/SF/L. plantarum nanofibers was detected at temperatures higher than 233 °C. From 233 °C and 486 °C, the total weight loss reached 78% for PVA/L. plantarum nanofibers. For PVA/SF/L. plantarum nanofibers, there are two different stages of weight loss. Between 235 °C and 276 °C, the weight loss rate of PVA /SF/L. plantarum nanofibers was only 10%, and the loss weight rate was slow. Between 276 °C and 486 °C, the weight loss was 68%, and the weight rate was rapid. As can be seen from this results, loading different materials like the addition of SF into nanocarriers could have an effect on thermal decomposition like other finds (Ceylan, Sengor, Sagdıc, & Yilmaz, 2017). (See Figs. 6 and 7.)"
12,Stress experiment in simulated gastric juice,"3.4 Stress experiment in simulated gastric juice L. plantarum loaded on PVA/SF nanofibers grew normally in medium after being stressed in artificial gastric juice for 2.0 h and the optical density (OD) value in the stable growth period was 2.75. However, the OD of L. plantarum without encapsulation was 0.17 and did not grow in the medium from 3.0 h to 18 h after being stressed under the same conditions. The above results show that the biomass of L. plantarum loaded on PVA/SF nanofiber is significantly different from that of nonencapsulated L. plantarum. Free L. plantarum are more likely hydrolyzed by pepsin in the artificial gastric juice, while PVA/SF nanofibers were not destroyed by enzymatic action. The nanofibers established a three-dimensional protective barrier against artificial gastric juice. However, once H+ in artificial gastric juice enters the PVA/SF nanofibers, it can be neutralized by the free acid amino acid in PVA/SF nanofibers. The stronger the buffering capacity, the better the internal environment of the nanofibers maintained (Zou et al., 2012), and this is conducive to the viability of probiotics."
13,Conclusions,"The electrospinning of PVA/L. plantarum has a low success rate, and the nanofiber membrane obtained is too thin to easily collect. As a result, subsequent experiments cannot be carried out. Therefore, SF was added to make up for this deficiency, and L. plantarum-loaded (PVA/SF/L. plantarum) nanofibers were successfully obtained. The microbiological results revealed that compared with free L. plantarum, the PVA/SF nanofibers significantly improved the viability of L. plantarum under artificial gastric juice treatment at 37 °C for 2 h, and the OD value in the stable growth period was 2.75."
